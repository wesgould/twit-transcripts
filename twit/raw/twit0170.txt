[00:02:14.360 --> 00:02:15.080]   Yeah.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:20.760]   Also here in studio with us, always glad to welcome Mr. Alex Lindsey from the Pixel Core.
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:22.600]   You'll be here a lot more now that you live a block away.
[00:02:23.400 --> 00:02:25.400]   So, Ryan, you were on the Virgin.
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:28.040]   It was Virgin America's first Wi-Fi flight.
[00:02:28.040 --> 00:02:31.640]   It's not the first Wi-Fi flight ever.
[00:02:31.640 --> 00:02:35.400]   The company who's providing service is called Air Cell.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.600]   And the service they're providing is called GoGo.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.480]   Just in case anyone's curious as to what they should be looking out for.
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.800]   But so this GoGo service has been active on a couple of other airlines in very,
[00:02:47.800 --> 00:02:48.760]   very limited release.
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:51.640]   Delta, American, Air Canada.
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:54.200]   I think they all have a plane or two that are being outfitted.
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:58.360]   But Virgin America is the first airline that is rolling it out fleet wide.
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:02.280]   So within the next couple of months, they're going to have every single plane.
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:03.080]   We'll have Wi-Fi.
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.160]   Oh, I love Virgin America, but I like them even more.
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:05.480]   Yeah, I know.
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:08.360]   It's as if you didn't already have reason enough to fly them.
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:08.680]   Yeah.
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.360]   Now it's just it's it's it's all on.
[00:03:10.360 --> 00:03:12.440]   Come for the disco balls. Stay for the Wi-Fi.
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.480]   No Wi-Fi.
[00:03:17.480 --> 00:03:20.840]   I will definitely give you that.
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.560]   It is one of those moments where you can kind of catch up on reading or an email or whatever.
[00:03:25.560 --> 00:03:30.040]   Just it's one of those chances to just completely disconnect and not having a choice.
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:34.760]   Then again, you don't have to fly Virgin America.
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:37.720]   And frankly, you don't have to turn on your Wi-Fi and take for it.
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:37.960]   True.
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:38.920]   That's a really good point.
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:39.960]   You don't have to.
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:40.840]   I was wondering, right?
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.360]   Did they explain how they get around the issue of having Wi-Fi radios on?
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:48.760]   Because it's something if you're on a plane that doesn't have Wi-Fi,
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:52.600]   they make you turn off the Wi-Fi radios on your laptop usually.
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:54.520]   You know, I didn't really ask them too much about that.
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:59.480]   I think it's kind of an open secret though that they were lying all this time.
[00:03:59.480 --> 00:03:59.960]   Yeah.
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:05.240]   FAA does that to be really, you know, they try to restrict wireless signals to be as
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:06.360]   conservative as possible.
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:10.840]   And there's a lot of spectrum that just doesn't go anywhere near the communications traffic from a
[00:04:10.840 --> 00:04:11.240]   plane.
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:17.400]   So the actual signals they have going to the plane that are providing the data to the Wi-Fi,
[00:04:17.400 --> 00:04:20.200]   to the end cabin data is EVDL.
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:22.440]   I mean, it's their spectrum.
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:23.240]   It's EVDL.
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:23.800]   It's not.
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:24.360]   It's not.
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:26.040]   That's how they're connecting to the ground station.
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.160]   Exactly.
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:29.960]   And so it's 3.6 megabits downstream in one point.
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.160]   For the whole cabin.
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:31.960]   For the whole cabin.
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:36.520]   And so, and I can talk a little bit about what that was like, you know,
[00:04:36.520 --> 00:04:40.200]   being in that cabin and sharing with everybody because it is a shared connection.
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.000]   Was it a full flight?
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.680]   It was a full flight.
[00:04:42.680 --> 00:04:43.480]   It was a press flight.
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.560]   So 100% saturation.
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.000]   Everybody on the plane was using the Wi-Fi.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.120]   So it was about as bad as you could possibly imagine.
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.480]   And it's still great.
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.280]   Really?
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:55.080]   It was wonderful.
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.920]   I had no real complaints.
[00:04:56.920 --> 00:04:57.320]   I mean, yeah.
[00:04:57.320 --> 00:04:59.240]   You said you were able to get on the pirate bay?
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:05.000]   I didn't say what torrents I was downloading, but I did.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:08.360]   I actually tested downloading a torrent and it did work.
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:09.480]   Here's the thing though.
[00:05:09.480 --> 00:05:15.160]   They said that AirSell is providing the GoGo service, said that they want to cut off,
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:15.480]   chat.
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.600]   So, boy, you know, I chat that kind of stuff.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:20.040]   No, I am.
[00:05:20.040 --> 00:05:21.080]   No, no, no, no.
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.520]   They do the, I am as fine.
[00:05:22.520 --> 00:05:23.000]   Just video chat.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   But they don't want to do audio or video streams.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:28.920]   Not even because the bandwidth couldn't handle it because I think that it can.
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:29.640]   I mean, it will.
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:30.600]   It's not that I think it can.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:31.880]   I mean, I saw it.
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:33.240]   I tested it, you know.
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:34.360]   I was doing bit torrenting.
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:37.000]   I was sitting next to my pal Brian Lamb, the editor of, I'm sorry,
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   the assistant editorial director over at Gawker and Gizmodo.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:43.320]   And he was testing iChat and it was working fine.
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:44.600]   So you can do it.
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:46.600]   And the latency is not that bad.
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:49.320]   I could be recording Twitch from 35,000 feet if I wanted to.
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:55.240]   It's actually that they're doing it out of courtesy and respect for the other passengers.
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.840]   Nobody wants to hear somebody go.
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:05:59.960]   And then I said, and that's why I don't want cell phones on flights.
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:00.600]   Exactly.
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:01.720]   And they were pretty upfront about that.
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:06.280]   They were like, look, we're choosing to block this off because we don't, you know,
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:09.880]   we don't want people just gabbing on phone or on chat or on.
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:12.440]   Do they still have cell phones in there?
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:13.560]   And is that the other reason, right?
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.720]   Because they want to charge you the eight bucks a minute for the cell phone.
[00:06:15.720 --> 00:06:18.520]   No, there's no Virgin America doesn't have any.
[00:06:18.520 --> 00:06:19.640]   They don't have souls?
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:20.200]   No, no.
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:26.280]   As far as I know, all airlines have had those shut down and that spectrum has since been allocated to data.
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:26.840]   Oh, really?
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.640]   So yeah, the whole intention here was to kind of take out all those inflight cell phones.
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:36.120]   All those licenses have been expired and that spectrum was auctioned off, I believe last year.
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.880]   So that's what this is.
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:38.360]   I didn't know that.
[00:06:38.360 --> 00:06:41.160]   So you mean that phone in the back of the seat that hasn't worked for a year?
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:43.800]   Yeah.
[00:06:43.800 --> 00:06:45.000]   You don't fly air.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.520]   You don't fly air Canada.
[00:06:46.520 --> 00:06:48.760]   They don't take nothing out.
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:50.280]   They'd have now they didn't have a hole in the seat.
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:51.880]   What are they going to do with the last trays?
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:52.120]   Yeah.
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:53.880]   Wow.
[00:06:53.880 --> 00:06:54.760]   I didn't realize that.
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:58.360]   So yeah, so it's, you know, it's been, it worked really well.
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:03.880]   It's $10 for flights under three hours and $13 for flights over three hours.
[00:07:03.880 --> 00:07:05.400]   In my opinion, totally worth it.
[00:07:05.400 --> 00:07:05.800]   Yeah.
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:05.800]   Yeah.
[00:07:05.800 --> 00:07:07.000]   And again,
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.800]   worth it, but also a huge profit center for them.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:10.280]   My God.
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.440]   Oh, they're, they're going to make so much money.
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:13.000]   Oh my God.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:15.400]   So they're going to make so much money is ridiculous.
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:20.840]   I was on an S.A.S. flight two or three years ago that had Wi-Fi transatlantic.
[00:07:20.840 --> 00:07:24.520]   And I used it off and on, but you know, after a while after the novelty wears off,
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:26.680]   you don't really want to be online all the time, do you?
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:32.520]   I like to be, you know, I have a 10 hour flight or 11 hour flight on Tuesday.
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.280]   No, no, I, I worked the whole time.
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.880]   I mean, that's usually my, that's like my, the one isolated time that I have is to,
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:41.400]   where nothing's bothering me, I actually probably get most of our planning and, and,
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:42.520]   and all of our tech screen.
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:43.960]   Why, why did it take so long in the U.S.
[00:07:43.960 --> 00:07:45.640]   because Lufthans has had this for years.
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:50.920]   Yeah. Boeing, Boeing has had a sub company called connection and it's been, it's been
[00:07:50.920 --> 00:07:52.520]   rolled out in parts of Europe and stuff like that.
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:53.240]   Here's the thing though.
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:54.120]   There's a couple of bits.
[00:07:54.120 --> 00:07:58.680]   First of all, since this is a U.S. service and there isn't really any way,
[00:07:58.680 --> 00:08:02.920]   except by satellite to get internet access, if you're safe flying over the ocean.
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:07.560]   You can't expect this to work if, if you're flying out of the country.
[00:08:07.560 --> 00:08:09.560]   Now, Virgin America doesn't have any international flights.
[00:08:09.560 --> 00:08:11.080]   So maybe, oh, like,
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.040]   worked across the Atlantic.
[00:08:12.040 --> 00:08:13.320]   So I guess they were using a different ticket.
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:14.280]   Right. So they, they might be.
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:15.160]   Most of you satellites.
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:17.240]   Yeah. Most of the international flights.
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:21.080]   Here's the thing about that working condition is, and, and that, you know,
[00:08:21.080 --> 00:08:24.040]   disconnectivity, so to speak is here's what you got to do.
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:28.200]   You know, it's not really anybody's business, what airline you're flying.
[00:08:28.200 --> 00:08:29.720]   I mean, and if you're on a,
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:31.800]   I'll tell them you're on Virgin Atlantic with full.
[00:08:31.800 --> 00:08:31.960]   Exactly.
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:32.960]   And you're on a flight.
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.520]   Well, our flights feel like, you know, I'm taking a flight tomorrow.
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:35.240]   I'm going to be offline.
[00:08:35.240 --> 00:08:35.720]   Yeah.
[00:08:35.720 --> 00:08:36.680]   I do that.
[00:08:36.680 --> 00:08:37.880]   Do all your web surfing.
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:39.560]   You know, you can check your email and stuff like that.
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:40.440]   Just don't respond.
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:41.000]   I used to say.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.040]   I just make sure a Skype is turned off.
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.160]   I always, you know, it's hard.
[00:08:43.160 --> 00:08:43.880]   It's, I always forget.
[00:08:43.880 --> 00:08:45.320]   And then suddenly I'm, I'm there.
[00:08:45.320 --> 00:08:45.880]   I'm there.
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:46.680]   When I was.
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:48.120]   Your, your presence is your choice.
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.320]   You know, you can turn off a game and still be browsing the web and checking your
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.440]   news feeds and stuff like that.
[00:08:52.440 --> 00:08:53.320]   Because that's what I'd be doing.
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:55.320]   That's my biggest problem is I get off the plane.
[00:08:55.320 --> 00:09:04.680]   Like, you know, I have like a thousand news articles on red.
[00:09:04.680 --> 00:09:06.200]   It's a big pain.
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:11.080]   I would go, when I would go to Canada, I would say, I would actually put a responder on my mail.
[00:09:11.080 --> 00:09:12.280]   I'm going out of the country.
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:13.880]   I won't be a, a reachable.
[00:09:13.880 --> 00:09:15.640]   Like I'm going to the darkest continent.
[00:09:15.640 --> 00:09:17.480]   I'm going to be in Toronto.
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:19.480]   I don't know if they have internet there.
[00:09:19.480 --> 00:09:22.040]   So don't, you know, and I would have a week that I'd have to answer email.
[00:09:22.040 --> 00:09:22.760]   I loved that.
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.200]   I've announced experimentation with it.
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:25.240]   Some of them already have it.
[00:09:25.240 --> 00:09:28.600]   It's that they are going to roll it out on all their planes by the middle of next year.
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.360]   Is that their big hook that they're pushing?
[00:09:30.360 --> 00:09:31.560]   Yeah, pretty much.
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:36.200]   And there's actually a couple of other little things that aren't really being talked about.
[00:09:36.200 --> 00:09:37.720]   One is that they're not filtering traffic.
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.960]   And they're the only airline that's not filtering traffic.
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:44.120]   So if you're on American and, and you go to a site that is quote unquote questionable.
[00:09:44.120 --> 00:09:47.360]   And you never know what sites are considered questionable.
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:52.600]   I mean, you know, boy, boy, boy, it's, and it's considered a going for site.
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:53.600]   You might not be able to access it.
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.600]   They filter that traffic.
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:57.160]   They will actually be looking for questionable material.
[00:09:57.160 --> 00:09:59.760]   Virgin has said that they're not going to do that at all.
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:06.360]   So you could technically be browsing, you know, adult material, not that I would recommend
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:07.360]   doing so.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:10.200]   I mean, it might be, you know, offensive to the people sitting next to you.
[00:10:10.200 --> 00:10:13.760]   But that was one of the reasons the other airlines justified is they didn't want to
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:16.600]   have to have the flight attendants responding to complaints from people.
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:18.120]   This person next to me surfing porn.
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.560]   And so that's why they said they could put the phone to us.
[00:10:20.560 --> 00:10:24.080]   Sometimes I'll watch a movie with a nude scene and I'll go, whoa, and I'll cover it up.
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.400]   I mean, you know, people have laptops.
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:27.040]   So then they're going to have stuff on their laptop.
[00:10:27.040 --> 00:10:28.040]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:32.160]   It's not like that individual, you know, couldn't have already just loaded their laptop
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:35.240]   up with questionable material and started watching and reviewing and browsing with it
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:36.840]   or whatever, even offline.
[00:10:36.840 --> 00:10:41.040]   I mean, if somebody wants to do that in a public place, internet connected with your
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.720]   know, they'll, you know, they can do that.
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:46.760]   So the whole like I'm going to filter your traffic is just kind of silly to me.
[00:10:46.760 --> 00:10:47.760]   It's just a pain.
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.400]   What kind of filter are they using?
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:55.000]   I don't know exactly what the filtering solution that they're using or, you know, who is building
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:56.440]   their whitelist.
[00:10:56.440 --> 00:11:00.120]   But I also know that one of the things that they're doing is some traffic shaping.
[00:11:00.120 --> 00:11:04.800]   So basically if you're like, if you're abusing the traffic and the system, they won't kick
[00:11:04.800 --> 00:11:07.600]   you off because you did pay, but they'll scale you back.
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:09.280]   I mean, America or Virgin?
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:15.080]   Well, I think this is pervasive across all of the go-go installs on any airline.
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:20.360]   So if there are 10 people using the traffic, then, you know, everybody would get 360K,
[00:11:20.360 --> 00:11:24.040]   you know, if they were all using all of their bandwidth at the same time, it would equal
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:25.040]   that out.
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:28.240]   But one of the coolest things that we're talking about is if you're on a red eye and everybody's
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:31.800]   asleep and you just have to be up before in the morning and you're using the internet,
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:34.680]   you get, you know, as much bandwidth as there is.
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:36.720]   So it's proportionate to how many users are on the connection.
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:39.160]   Where can I get 3.6 megabait, the Evdoh?
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.600]   I'd like to try that.
[00:11:40.600 --> 00:11:41.600]   Yeah.
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:43.400]   What cell company offers that?
[00:11:43.400 --> 00:11:44.400]   Air cell.
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:49.000]   So I guess I thought Evdoh was limited one and a half megabits, I guess.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:50.920]   Maybe it's faster than that.
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:51.920]   That's what they count.
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:52.920]   Okay.
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:56.920]   I'm getting 2.2, I think, at times.
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.560]   Speaking of 2.2, you put the new iPhone firmware?
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:00.560]   I did.
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:01.560]   I did.
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:02.560]   I like the Street View.
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:05.160]   The Street View is the best implementation that I could imagine.
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:08.440]   You know, I was like, I expected it to be some kind of clunky, like I have to roll.
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:11.120]   I couldn't find it when I first started because I was trying to roll up the page.
[00:12:11.120 --> 00:12:12.760]   Like, and I was like, "Where's the Street View?
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:13.760]   Where's the Street View?"
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:15.200]   I was like, "Oh, it's that little..."
[00:12:15.200 --> 00:12:16.200]   Drop a pin, baby.
[00:12:16.200 --> 00:12:19.440]   We dropped a pin and then there's this little button there and you just hit that little
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.440]   button, the little person button or whatever.
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:24.480]   And I love the way it kind of flies into it.
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.720]   I was looking at a Petaluma right here, actually.
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:28.720]   I just say Google is own in the iPhone.
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:31.000]   I don't know what the G1's doing, but Google is on the...
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:33.680]   Between the voice search, of course, you have Street View.
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:35.480]   You've had actually a better Street View on the G1.
[00:12:35.480 --> 00:12:38.720]   Yeah, and you have the compass thing on the G1 where you can actually turn it around.
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:42.960]   But my thing is, other than the G-Wiz factor, what is it?
[00:12:42.960 --> 00:12:43.960]   What is the biggest...
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:44.960]   You know what I like?
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:45.960]   I do it a lot.
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:50.560]   I'll tell you what, I use Street View for a lot is verifying because, like for instance,
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:54.080]   I want to go to a Starbucks or I want to go to a pizza or whatever and you'll see a
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:56.160]   whole bunch of them show up on a...
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:59.160]   You'll search an address and you'll say, "Show me a coffee shop or whatever," and you'll
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:02.280]   see like six of them and there's really only three of them there.
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:04.760]   They've either moved or it's inaccurate or whatever.
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:09.160]   And so I'll use the Street View a lot to make sure that there's a building, at least
[00:13:09.160 --> 00:13:11.600]   when that car went by that says Starbucks on it.
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:13.320]   You're the Ronald Reagan of fast food.
[00:13:13.320 --> 00:13:14.320]   Trust but verify.
[00:13:14.320 --> 00:13:16.320]   You're using Street View.
[00:13:16.320 --> 00:13:19.440]   Well, that's warning in America so he needs his coffee.
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:21.120]   How about the other good thing?
[00:13:21.120 --> 00:13:22.720]   I love transit directions.
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:24.720]   I mean, if you must like that.
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:25.720]   Transit directions are brilliant.
[00:13:25.720 --> 00:13:26.720]   I love that.
[00:13:26.720 --> 00:13:28.640]   It gives you the dollar amount.
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:31.480]   It tells you what trains to take when the trains are arriving.
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:33.680]   I want to test it when I'm in France.
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:34.920]   I presume it would work worldwide.
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:35.920]   I'd love to see it.
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:37.880]   I'm going to test it in Japan next week.
[00:13:37.880 --> 00:13:38.880]   See if that...
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:39.880]   And pedestrian directions.
[00:13:39.880 --> 00:13:41.400]   It used to be you'd have to take the stupid...
[00:13:41.400 --> 00:13:42.400]   The highway.
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:46.800]   Car directions and figure out, okay, what I really need to do is just go straight there.
[00:13:46.800 --> 00:13:47.800]   And now you get the...
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:51.400]   I've been using that on the website for a long time and I really enjoy that.
[00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:52.400]   Yeah.
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:53.400]   I think a great idea.
[00:13:53.400 --> 00:13:54.400]   Yeah.
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:55.400]   You know, I will say this.
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:56.400]   Having played with I have a G1 and I have an iPhone 3G.
[00:13:56.400 --> 00:13:59.680]   In fact, I'm playing with the implementation on the G1.
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:01.440]   The 3G implementation is better.
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.440]   It's nicer.
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:06.400]   It works faster and I have to say it's smoother animation.
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:11.200]   You're saying that T-Mobile 3G is better than the AT&T team team team.
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:13.200]   I'm saying that the iPhone 3G is better.
[00:14:13.200 --> 00:14:14.200]   The iPhone is better.
[00:14:14.200 --> 00:14:15.800]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:14:15.800 --> 00:14:20.000]   Their implementation of Street View is better than Google's own implementation of Street
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   View on their device.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.200]   What's Google doing?
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.200]   Why?
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:25.200]   Well, it could be just a matter of teams.
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.960]   You know, it's not like it's a central team.
[00:14:26.960 --> 00:14:28.800]   It's probably there's a team working on the iPhone apps.
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:29.800]   There's a team working on the team.
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:30.800]   Right.
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:33.440]   No, well, Apple actually develops all their iPhone apps.
[00:14:33.440 --> 00:14:35.840]   So the Google Maps app is not developed by Google.
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:36.840]   It's an Apple thing.
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:37.840]   Right.
[00:14:37.840 --> 00:14:38.840]   But the Apple time.
[00:14:38.840 --> 00:14:40.720]   Same thing with...
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.560]   The Google mobile app is not developed by Apple.
[00:14:43.560 --> 00:14:44.560]   It's developed by Google.
[00:14:44.560 --> 00:14:46.760]   Yeah, I talked to the guy who actually got it.
[00:14:46.760 --> 00:14:50.600]   Yeah, the Google Maps and the YouTube app are both actually developed by Apple.
[00:14:50.600 --> 00:14:51.960]   Yeah, Apple Corn worked on that.
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:55.840]   I think I liked better about the 2.2 firmware was the direct downloads of podcasts.
[00:14:55.840 --> 00:15:00.840]   Yeah, I believe that you get the new episode when you're like, "Ah, I forgot to sync."
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:02.840]   As podcasts, we love that.
[00:15:02.840 --> 00:15:03.840]   Yeah.
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:06.000]   I don't think there's anything terribly revolutionary in 2.2.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   It's nice to have some.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.120]   I think downloading podcasts from a podcast or point of view is revolutionary.
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:13.440]   It could open things up very quickly because I know that it's something that I think about.
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:16.840]   I'll be somewhere and I'll think, "Oh, I really want to listen to that."
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:18.800]   And I go, "Oh, I have to go back to my computer and I have to do this thing."
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:22.040]   I think you're limited to 10 megs if it's a 3G, right?
[00:15:22.040 --> 00:15:23.040]   Right.
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:24.040]   If you're on a Wi-Fi, there's no.
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.040]   There's no limit.
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.040]   The Wi-Fi you can do as much as you want.
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:27.040]   That's to keep people from having a...
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:29.600]   Well, but the problem is that the subscriptions aren't pervasive.
[00:15:29.600 --> 00:15:33.080]   So what you're subscribed to on your desktop is not carried over.
[00:15:33.080 --> 00:15:37.880]   So if you haven't gotten the latest episode, the last time that you synced, your device
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:38.960]   does not know that.
[00:15:38.960 --> 00:15:43.560]   So you have to kind of know to go check this episode and then download it.
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:44.560]   It's not that hard.
[00:15:44.560 --> 00:15:45.560]   I did it.
[00:15:45.560 --> 00:15:46.560]   It's afternoon.
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:49.160]   I was out with the dog and I was wanting to listen to Extra Life Radio and I didn't
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:50.160]   have the latest episode.
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:51.160]   And I was like, "Oh, crap.
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:52.160]   I forgot to sync."
[00:15:52.160 --> 00:15:54.440]   And then I remembered, "Oh, I can press this button."
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:58.120]   And while I was driving, it downloaded the episode so I went out for the walk and we got
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:15:59.120]   to the park.
[00:15:59.120 --> 00:16:00.120]   I had it.
[00:16:00.120 --> 00:16:01.120]   I think that's pretty cool.
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:04.040]   So it launches the iTunes Store, right?
[00:16:04.040 --> 00:16:05.440]   Is that how it does it?
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:06.440]   Yeah.
[00:16:06.440 --> 00:16:13.320]   So you go to your podcasts, whatever you've got on here, GDGT or a sort in the laser pointer
[00:16:13.320 --> 00:16:16.120]   and then you say, "I'm sorry, I had to do that."
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:18.440]   And then you say, "At the bottom, get more episodes.
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:19.440]   You press get more episodes."
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:20.960]   Then it launches the iTunes Store.
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:22.400]   It shows you a list.
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:26.560]   So you're saying because it shows you the list of, oh, it didn't work on that one.
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:27.560]   Huh.
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:29.080]   I don't know what happened there.
[00:16:29.080 --> 00:16:33.440]   So here's the important thing I think though, that we have to kind of put in perspective
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:34.600]   with what Apple is doing.
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:39.240]   And that is that if you look at every single smartphone OS that has come out in the last
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:45.040]   decade, Palm, Windows Mobile or before it was called Windows Mobile is Windows CE and
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:46.040]   windows CE.net.
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:48.040]   Oh, it's so easy.
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:49.040]   Yeah.
[00:16:49.040 --> 00:16:50.040]   Ooh.
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:51.040]   Times.
[00:16:51.040 --> 00:16:55.920]   You've got Android, you've got Symbian, you've got UIQ.
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:17:00.840]   There's this plethora of smartphone platforms and they're all good in their own right and
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:03.680]   they'll have their advantages and disadvantages.
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:11.680]   But none have been as aggressive and as, you know, so quick to add new features and expand
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:15.440]   on the functionality of the platform as Apple has with the iPhone.
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:18.680]   Which is funny because we complain a lot about how they're not going fast enough.
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:20.960]   Well, they still have cut and paste.
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:23.400]   And background processes and all these things.
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:25.120]   But I agree, right?
[00:17:25.120 --> 00:17:31.720]   Those are design decisions and I think that it's too kind of, you know, put those off in
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:34.120]   a different corner than they're choosing not to.
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:36.080]   I mean, yes, granted it is a choice not to do it.
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:37.800]   But those are those are choices.
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:41.320]   It's not like they're they have an implemented copy and paste because it just hasn't been
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:42.640]   on their radar.
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:44.880]   It's really I think for them it's been a design decision.
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:49.400]   They haven't, you know, found an implementation that they think works elegantly.
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:50.400]   Any implementation would work.
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:52.440]   Team Mobile Storm, nice implementation.
[00:17:52.440 --> 00:17:53.440]   You tap it.
[00:17:53.440 --> 00:17:54.440]   It does it.
[00:17:54.440 --> 00:17:55.440]   G1, tap it.
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:56.440]   How do you like the storm?
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:59.080]   The G1 implementation is not that good because it's not.
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.080]   Well, it's limited.
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.080]   It's not everywhere.
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.080]   It's not a problem.
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:05.240]   How about the storm that's got full cut and paste, right?
[00:18:05.240 --> 00:18:07.280]   It does have copy and paste.
[00:18:07.280 --> 00:18:08.280]   Copy and paste.
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:09.280]   And also as background processes.
[00:18:09.280 --> 00:18:10.280]   Yep.
[00:18:10.280 --> 00:18:11.280]   Which the iPhone actually has.
[00:18:11.280 --> 00:18:13.800]   I mean, if you're using the iPod, it's a background process.
[00:18:13.800 --> 00:18:15.840]   It runs in the background where you're doing other stuff.
[00:18:15.840 --> 00:18:16.920]   So it's capable of doing it.
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:18.560]   They just don't allow only only.
[00:18:18.560 --> 00:18:21.040]   I think you greatly affect battery power.
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:23.080]   You know, if you start you start running those processes.
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:25.640]   Well, I have to say the G1's battery life is awful.
[00:18:25.640 --> 00:18:26.640]   I mean, it's unusual.
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:29.480]   Yeah, and that's it's something we're already seeing with the G1 because the G1 it comes,
[00:18:29.480 --> 00:18:31.920]   you know, by default it's looking on location.
[00:18:31.920 --> 00:18:34.640]   It's got apps in the background that are looking for location.
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:38.480]   It's got push Gmail, you know, between the Wi-Fi, the cellular, all that stuff.
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:44.280]   I mean, it is one of the most, you know, abysmal battery life experiences on any mobile device
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:46.040]   out there right now.
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:48.600]   And it's the battery life that's actually the worst part of the G1.
[00:18:48.600 --> 00:18:51.760]   Everything else that, you know, they got fairly well.
[00:18:51.760 --> 00:18:53.680]   But that battery life is just terrible.
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:54.680]   How about the storm?
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:18:55.680]   How's the battery life on the storm?
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:18:56.680]   Is it okay?
[00:18:56.680 --> 00:18:59.400]   I haven't actually gotten to play with the storm yet.
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:00.400]   What?
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:01.400]   So mean, either.
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.120]   Yeah, Tom, you must have gotten a storm here with the CBS.
[00:19:04.120 --> 00:19:08.040]   Yeah, I haven't got my hands on it myself.
[00:19:08.040 --> 00:19:09.840]   Horizon is not done.
[00:19:09.840 --> 00:19:14.280]   Yeah, let me I'm going to let you in on a little gadget industry secret.
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:17.000]   Verizon is not very pro press.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.840]   They don't really do a lot of outreach.
[00:19:19.840 --> 00:19:21.480]   I was quite curious.
[00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:25.360]   You add the behest of the gadget companies.
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:27.520]   And here's another little secret for you.
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:29.760]   RIM is also not pro press.
[00:19:29.760 --> 00:19:32.000]   They don't do a lot of outreach.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:37.200]   You know, I was actually I think somebody from a gadget was I was at a dinner with with
[00:19:37.200 --> 00:19:40.360]   a bacilli co CEO of RIM.
[00:19:40.360 --> 00:19:43.840]   This is like last year and talking about a gadget.
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.520]   He's like, what's a gadget?
[00:19:46.520 --> 00:19:48.320]   Thanks for being attention.
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:49.320]   That doesn't matter.
[00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:53.440]   You know, I guess maybe that sounds a little silly coming from, you know, the former editor
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:54.440]   of a gadget.
[00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:58.560]   If you don't know what a gadget is, that means he basically been under a boulder for the last
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:19:59.560]   time.
[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:03.560]   If you're a cell phone guy, you really ought to know who the big players are.
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:06.120]   I kind of feel like the bold is a better choice in the storm anyway.
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:07.120]   I like the bold.
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:08.120]   I do like the bold.
[00:20:08.120 --> 00:20:09.480]   The fun of the bold so far.
[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:10.480]   Yeah.
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:11.480]   I like it.
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:13.680]   It's a little bit kind of a brickish to me.
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:16.200]   It's a lot thicker than I think it needed to be.
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:18.280]   Yeah, you know what's in your hand.
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:19.960]   No, that guessing.
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:22.320]   No, that slim slim and trim guessing.
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:26.400]   You know, it's interesting when we're talking about the differences between how Apple, you
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:29.560]   know, implements things on the iPhone and what we've got going on with Blackberry.
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:35.720]   It sort of fits into that old pattern that Omberto Echo identified between DOS and Mac.
[00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:38.720]   DOS being the Protestants and Mac being the Catholics.
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:42.640]   Mac has always, and Apple has always granted you this is what this is what you do.
[00:20:42.640 --> 00:20:44.040]   You play by these rules.
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:45.200]   You will be happy.
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:46.200]   Just trust us.
[00:20:46.200 --> 00:20:47.200]   You'll have good battery life.
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:48.200]   Don't complain.
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:50.880]   And DOS was always like, go anywhere, do whatever you want.
[00:20:50.880 --> 00:20:51.880]   It's up to you.
[00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:54.320]   You know, your sins are on your own head.
[00:20:54.320 --> 00:21:00.280]   And that's essentially in a little less extreme way, the difference between, you know, a Blackberry
[00:21:00.280 --> 00:21:02.120]   and a palm versus the iPhone.
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:03.960]   The iPhone says, no, you want good battery life.
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:05.720]   So we're going to let you do these things.
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:06.920]   Blackberry is like, hey, it's up to you.
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:07.920]   Your battery runs out.
[00:21:07.920 --> 00:21:10.120]   You shouldn't have used, you know, so you can change your battery.
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:11.120]   You can change it.
[00:21:11.120 --> 00:21:12.120]   Right.
[00:21:12.120 --> 00:21:13.120]   Yeah.
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:14.640]   I'm a little bit of freedom to do that.
[00:21:14.640 --> 00:21:16.080]   There are very few Blackberry apps.
[00:21:16.080 --> 00:21:19.680]   I mean, there are there out there, but not too many people use them and they're all pretty
[00:21:19.680 --> 00:21:22.040]   much sandbox and they're more or less Java based.
[00:21:22.040 --> 00:21:23.720]   So you can't do a whole lot with them.
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:25.080]   It's not the same nature of apps.
[00:21:25.080 --> 00:21:28.120]   I mean, Blackberry, I guess, is technically a smartphone, but it's not that it's not a
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:33.760]   smartphone in the depth that you think of a poem device or Windows mobile device or
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.280]   the G one, but at the Android, it's being a smartphone.
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:39.440]   I mean, those are those are on a whole other level and you get really kind of low level
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:41.400]   access to some of that hardware.
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:43.160]   Not really the same on the Blackberry.
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:47.240]   How many apps do you guys download?
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:48.240]   For the iPhone?
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:49.240]   I think I have four pages.
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:50.240]   Yeah.
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:52.520]   I mean, I get goes on and how often do you have?
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:54.080]   Every day I downloaded another one yesterday.
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:55.480]   I'm going to do a few a week.
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:56.480]   Maybe not every day.
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:59.560]   I'm going to you're going to hate me because I'm going to show you a desktop tower defense.
[00:21:59.560 --> 00:22:00.560]   No, I got it.
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:01.560]   You got it.
[00:22:01.560 --> 00:22:06.120]   After we talked about it on Mac on Mac, I got like, I got like, I got more than one field
[00:22:06.120 --> 00:22:08.200]   runners field runners is awesome.
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.200]   Yeah.
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:12.960]   Well, it's what's interesting though is that this is a I would estimate some of the best
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:17.360]   attach rate of software to a mobile device we've ever seen there.
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:21.320]   There are some really hard core smartphone users out there, but in terms of, you know,
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:28.000]   per capita, I think that there's more apps installed per device on the iPhone platform.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   Well, so easy.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   Compare the experience.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   Exactly.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:32.720]   It's part of the app store and that's why the other guys are doing that.
[00:22:32.720 --> 00:22:33.720]   Look at hands.
[00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:34.720]   That's why you go.
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:37.000]   I mean, buying that it's a painful experience to buy.
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:43.560]   And even I have to say, even the G one store is still nowhere near the elegance of the,
[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:44.560]   the Apple store.
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:48.000]   I think that it's so far is so my, how much I'm paying and everything else is so hidden
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.160]   behind things that I, I tend to.
[00:22:50.160 --> 00:22:51.160]   That's the other thing.
[00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:52.360]   I tend to just go, yeah, I'll get that.
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:53.360]   I'll get that.
[00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:54.360]   It's free.
[00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:55.360]   Yeah.
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:57.640]   It's a beautiful, beautiful cathedral, wonderful ceremony in the Apple church.
[00:22:57.640 --> 00:22:58.720]   You're going to love it.
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:22:59.880]   You don't need all that freedom.
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:00.880]   You just abuse it.
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:01.880]   Hey, talking about print.
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:03.440]   Did you see this PC magazine?
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:04.440]   Of course you did.
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:05.440]   Everybody saw it.
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:06.440]   No more print edition.
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:07.440]   Yes.
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:11.160]   I saw Jim Lauter back the other day in a bar and we raised a glass.
[00:23:11.160 --> 00:23:12.160]   Yeah.
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:15.880]   I'll raise my, my, my coffee mug to raise a brain tonic.
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:16.920]   I think of an era.
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:22.320]   This was the most powerful computer publication ever.
[00:23:22.320 --> 00:23:24.840]   When Spencer the cat, well, that was actually PC week.
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:25.840]   Spencer.
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:29.920]   But it was as if, as if David's when he threw a party at CES or a convex, everybody was there,
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:35.480]   including Bill Gates, PC magazines, Michael Miller editor in chief.
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:37.720]   You know, the most powerful guy in the business.
[00:23:37.720 --> 00:23:42.520]   A million, I think it went up to 1.2 or 1.3 million, Cirque.
[00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:44.160]   This was, this was dominant.
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:45.520]   And now they're giving up print.
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:47.560]   They're going to continue with the website.
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:50.560]   You got to remember this is, that was a different time though, Leo.
[00:23:50.560 --> 00:23:52.880]   I mean, that was four years ago.
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:54.120]   No, no, no, no.
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:58.480]   Yeah, it was, it was a higher Cirque, you know, 90s early aughts.
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:24:02.600]   But again, this is, this is before blogs really came onto the scene.
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:03.680]   There were not as many.
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:07.120]   You're probably as much responsible for killing it as anybody, Ryan Block.
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:09.400]   Yeah, well, you're full.
[00:24:09.400 --> 00:24:13.520]   When it came out, I twittered that, then the news came out, I twittered that it, it bums
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:16.960]   me out, but there, there's a couple of bits of silver linings here.
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:22.400]   First, they killed it before it killed itself, which is important.
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:27.920]   I mean, they could have just let the brand drive itself into the ground, but they didn't.
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:32.000]   And then secondly, and most importantly, they're, they're not shutting down operations.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   They're moving everything to the web, which is, which is what they should be doing anyway.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:37.320]   Yeah, I think that's a really good point, Ryan.
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:39.760]   It's PCMag.com is still around.
[00:24:39.760 --> 00:24:43.880]   It's not only, it's not only around, but they actually do some really amazing content
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:44.880]   there.
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:48.440]   And, and the people who I know who work there are, are excellent.
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:53.080]   It's kind of a, it's funny how it's a misnomer because it's PCMag.com, you know, and it's
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:55.760]   clearly not a magazine anymore.
[00:24:55.760 --> 00:24:59.120]   And the magazine brand doesn't really make a lot of sense.
[00:24:59.120 --> 00:25:00.760]   But I mean, look, they, they do a good job.
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:03.200]   They've got a lot of great editors, a lot of great talent.
[00:25:03.200 --> 00:25:07.640]   And as far as publications go, you know, on the web, they're top notch.
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:08.800]   And I'm glad that they're still around.
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:13.120]   I'm glad they're putting 100% of the resources where it needs to be because frankly, people
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:16.200]   who are interested in technology are not buying paper magazines.
[00:25:16.200 --> 00:25:17.760]   They're absolutely, you know.
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:21.960]   Well, I think this was, this was an issue like when you looked at tech TV, as you know,
[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:24.760]   you saw tech TV going on the cable and you were like, what, where it really belonged
[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:26.080]   was on the, on the web.
[00:25:26.080 --> 00:25:28.920]   From day one, I said, where are we building a brick and mortar business?
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:29.920]   Right.
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:30.920]   It's crazy.
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:32.700]   This is the, this is the past.
[00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:36.720]   But Tom Merritt, is this the kind of the canary in the mind for other print magazines?
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:37.720]   Yeah.
[00:25:37.720 --> 00:25:38.720]   Yeah.
[00:25:38.720 --> 00:25:42.320]   The tech guys are the first to, you know, to adopt this web, this thing called the Internet.
[00:25:42.320 --> 00:25:45.600]   Well, we're some of the first magazines to go online.
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:47.360]   They were the tech magazines.
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:50.400]   So it, this is kind of a big deal when you step back.
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:57.800]   It's like, look, a, a print entity decided that its business can consist entirely online.
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:26:02.240]   It doesn't need a print adjutant to, for lack of a better word.
[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:04.400]   It doesn't need a print edition of itself.
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:08.240]   So is that going to be true of the economist?
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:11.720]   Is that going to be true of, you know, someday vanity fair?
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:16.520]   I mean, I think there are a lot of publications that lend themselves to having print, you
[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:17.520]   know, print magazines.
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:22.160]   I don't think that it's, this is a rule that is going to, you know, life magazine will
[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:24.320]   never go out of business because it's all pictures.
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:25.320]   It's very, wait a minute.
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:28.760]   They were out of business.
[00:26:28.760 --> 00:26:34.560]   What exactly, Ryan, I mean, I'll tell you, the only magazines it'll be around in 10 years
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:37.640]   will be the one sold at the grocery checkout line.
[00:26:37.640 --> 00:26:41.280]   Star, the star, the star, the globe, us magazine, entertainment, weekly.
[00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:44.720]   When you look at that tech section and the, you know, your Barnes and Noble or Borders
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:48.360]   where they have the huge magazine areas and you're always look at those and I'm like amazed.
[00:26:48.360 --> 00:26:50.600]   I'm like, really, there's this many magazines still?
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:51.600]   Yeah.
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:54.320]   It's the niche ones that people still buy for whatever.
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:58.600]   Well, I'd say that the, the, the funds, those, those niche ones don't really matter because,
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:02.240]   you know, as blogs publications start going to micro niche, I mean, you've got a photography
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:04.040]   magazine, well, screw the photography magazine.
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:08.080]   I want, I want a photography magazine, a photography blog that's only about can and lenses.
[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:09.680]   Yeah, I want the can and lens, the L lens.
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:13.320]   I can't access that blog every single place I am and I can't access that magazine.
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:14.320]   Well, that's the thing you're right.
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:16.280]   And that's why I think the grocery line is going to stick around.
[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:20.160]   There'll be bathroom reading, maybe not even airplane reading anymore after our first
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:25.840]   or yeah, for me, it's like it's, it's a when we're taking off and landing, you know, on
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:28.280]   an airplane bathroom and when my battery dies.
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:30.680]   You can't have your Kindle on taking off and landing.
[00:27:30.680 --> 00:27:31.680]   Yeah.
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:34.840]   Somebody told me for the first time that he'd been the, this Kindle was turned, the, the
[00:27:34.840 --> 00:27:36.480]   stewardess said turn off your Kindle, please.
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:38.480]   Because you know, those are dangerous.
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:39.480]   You never know.
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:40.480]   Well, I can't bring a prank.
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:45.120]   I actually tell them that it's off and that because it's being that, that it just looks
[00:27:45.120 --> 00:27:47.120]   like it's a, they have to live with yourself.
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:49.200]   Oh, and after that, really?
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:50.200]   Yeah.
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:51.600]   No, you can, well, you can pop out the battery.
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:54.880]   You can open up the back and take out the battery and then there's still one.
[00:27:54.880 --> 00:27:58.480]   They're like, Oh crap, maybe this guy's right.
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:00.120]   He is Ryan Block.
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:02.240]   You know, take that flight attendant.
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:04.640]   I like to be really passive aggressive with that stuff.
[00:28:04.640 --> 00:28:06.120]   Let's take mine.
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:10.040]   Well, I know that, I know that for me looking at these, at magazines, if I could get stuff
[00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:13.360]   like the economist and you know, there's a handful of other magazines that I read, I'd
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:18.240]   vastly prefer to have them, you know, on my, on my iPhone, to be honest.
[00:28:18.240 --> 00:28:20.360]   It makes me mad that I can't get the New Yorker on the Kindle.
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:22.200]   I mean, that's just a natural place for something.
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:23.280]   I don't want to read on an iPhone.
[00:28:23.280 --> 00:28:25.000]   That's a small screen.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.520]   Big enough e-paper like that, the one there showed that's like, you know, eight and a
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:34.200]   half by 11 size paper, something thin, allows me to switch pages, you know, can update itself
[00:28:34.200 --> 00:28:35.200]   well.
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:36.200]   How long before that comes out?
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:37.200]   I mean, it's, it's here.
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:39.960]   It's a matter of the business plan.
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:42.000]   Now technology is available.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:49.280]   Yank that is actually would be a mass market substitute for paper is not here.
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:52.000]   I think we're really talking about people in our generation.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:54.880]   I mean, you know, my, my kids aren't going to care.
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:59.440]   There is a, there is a, there is a display now that is, you know, updatable and high
[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:02.160]   resolution that can, that can do it.
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:04.960]   Just, it's too expensive and nobody wants to jump on that bandwagon.
[00:29:04.960 --> 00:29:07.120]   It needs to be, is it needs to be color?
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:11.560]   It needs to be thin and it needs, I don't necessarily think that needs to be flexible.
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:12.840]   I think people don't necessarily.
[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:13.840]   Yeah.
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:14.840]   I mean, flexible is great.
[00:29:14.840 --> 00:29:17.240]   This is really, really happen though.
[00:29:17.240 --> 00:29:18.240]   It needs to be thin.
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:22.280]   It needs to be color and it needs to refresh faster than, you know, a quarter of a second.
[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:25.280]   I mean, that's the part that is, it's hard.
[00:29:25.280 --> 00:29:28.320]   They can make them color and they can make them thin, but the refresh rate is still pretty
[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:29.320]   low.
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:30.320]   Isn't this really happening though?
[00:29:30.320 --> 00:29:34.320]   Not because of consumer preference, but because advertisers are abandoning print or is it,
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:38.280]   or the magazines are too expensive, the news print, the papers too expensive, the inks
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:39.520]   to expensive, the truck.
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:40.520]   He's deliberate.
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:42.160]   Yeah, inks expensive.
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:44.120]   Inks is like more expensive than gold.
[00:29:44.120 --> 00:29:45.120]   Yeah.
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:47.960]   Especially if you use a Lexmark printer.
[00:29:47.960 --> 00:29:50.040]   And it's even more expensive than a printer.
[00:29:50.040 --> 00:29:51.040]   Yeah.
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:53.840]   The economy is apprining our, it's all of those things.
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:54.840]   And the fact that-
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:56.440]   So it's not consumer preference we're talking about here.
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:57.680]   It's economics we're talking about.
[00:29:57.680 --> 00:29:58.680]   I think it's both.
[00:29:58.680 --> 00:29:59.920]   Yeah, I don't think it's one or the other.
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:05.520]   I mean, definitely consumer preference for wide ranging magazines like that has gone down.
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:07.600]   There's no doubt about it.
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:10.760]   There's still out there for the more niche magazines, hilarious.
[00:30:10.760 --> 00:30:12.680]   At least that's the evidence that I see.
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:17.320]   But something like a PCMag that covers so wide of an aspect, people are like, "Well, I get
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:19.520]   at other places, whether they're another magazine."
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:24.520]   Or like Brian has pointed out, you can get a blog on any subject you want.
[00:30:24.520 --> 00:30:28.560]   Anything that's timely, anything that's a narrow catch, you want on the web.
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:33.720]   I mean, even when PCMag has went to twice a month, it still had, I think, an unusable
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:34.720]   lead time.
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:40.840]   I also think, I read the New York Times every morning on the bus, but I don't pick up the
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:41.840]   paper.
[00:30:41.840 --> 00:30:42.840]   I see it.
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:45.360]   I see the paper at the coffee shop or whatever in the morning.
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:47.840]   But the idea that I have to carry it around and open it up and everything else-
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:48.840]   So you use your Kindle for that?
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:53.520]   No, I use either my iPhone or I use my computer with EVDO on the bus or whatever.
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:57.440]   But I'd much rather, I can very quickly get to all the things I can get to maybe if I
[00:30:57.440 --> 00:31:00.760]   missed yesterday's or whatever I can find all the links.
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:02.400]   I don't want to deal with the paper anymore.
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:05.600]   It's not hard on your eyes to read a lot.
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:07.880]   Or is it just that the time is limited enough?
[00:31:07.880 --> 00:31:09.920]   No, I read for an hour.
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:14.600]   I basically go through all of my RSS feeds on the bus in the morning about an hour.
[00:31:14.600 --> 00:31:16.720]   You know, that's why it doesn't really bother me at all.
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:21.600]   I think everybody should be listening to Audible.com because it's easy on your eyes.
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:23.840]   It's your ears that you care about.
[00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:24.840]   It's listening.
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:25.840]   That's what I'll tell you.
[00:31:25.840 --> 00:31:29.000]   I spent more time on the bus listening to Audible books.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.720]   I love that and you just close your eyes and relax and enjoy.
[00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:35.800]   When are you on the bus?
[00:31:35.800 --> 00:31:36.800]   What?
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:38.600]   You take the bus to be more.
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:40.360]   I take the bus to San Francisco.
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:41.760]   Alex does because he's there's an express bus.
[00:31:41.760 --> 00:31:43.240]   So it picks up here and goes straight down.
[00:31:43.240 --> 00:31:44.240]   Yes, you take that bus.
[00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:45.240]   It was a great bus.
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:46.800]   It's awesome because it's direct.
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:51.240]   Audible.com, this is a commercial now just to warn people who, well I segued into it
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:54.400]   so smoothly I might have fooled you.
[00:31:54.400 --> 00:32:00.880]   Audible.com/twit2, that's a special URL for the Audible Platinum plan.
[00:32:00.880 --> 00:32:05.960]   The Audible Platinum plan allows you to subscribe and get two books a month and when you do
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:08.920]   that, you're going to get two books right up front absolutely free.
[00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:10.480]   Well two credits.
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:12.760]   Many great choices on there.
[00:32:12.760 --> 00:32:17.840]   When you do Sword and Laser, do you do recommend also the audio versions of those sci-fi books?
[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:22.000]   Actually Audible was nice enough to throw some freebies towards Sword and Laser listeners.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.600]   So we don't make a big deal out of it.
[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:31.080]   Yeah, and that's one of the reasons is that Audible has actually built studios in their
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:36.320]   headquarters in New Jersey and they are recording a lot of these sci-fi books that were never
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:42.320]   recorded because you know, sci-fi publishers aren't exactly, you know, and they don't record
[00:32:42.320 --> 00:32:43.320]   it.
[00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:44.320]   We're barely got paper to put this thing on.
[00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:47.840]   So they have started this thing called Audible Frontiers where they're recording some of
[00:32:47.840 --> 00:32:50.600]   the best classic science fiction.
[00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:54.680]   In many cases for the first time, when I first joined Audible in 2001, that's one thing I
[00:32:54.680 --> 00:32:58.560]   looked for is where is the sci-fi and there wasn't a lot now.
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:32:59.560]   It's unlimited.
[00:32:59.560 --> 00:33:01.280]   There's just a ton of great science fiction.
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:03.720]   What are you reading on Sword and Laser this week?
[00:33:03.720 --> 00:33:07.720]   We are currently reading Memoirs Found in a Bathtub by Stanislav Lem.
[00:33:07.720 --> 00:33:09.480]   I love Stanislav Lem.
[00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:10.720]   Yeah, I love him.
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:13.360]   Oh man, I think he's kind of underrated.
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:15.720]   Well not underrated, but not so well known is he?
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:17.680]   Yeah, he's not as well known.
[00:33:17.680 --> 00:33:23.280]   So it was Veronica had a pick, well before Anithym Veronica had a pick, so this was my
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:24.280]   pick.
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:25.840]   And I tried to find something.
[00:33:25.840 --> 00:33:28.960]   And did Anithym was that like a three month long read?
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:31.160]   Practically, yeah.
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:35.400]   There's no, unfortunately, there's no Stanislav Lem on Audible yet.
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:37.840]   I'm sure that's something that they're working to address.
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:41.560]   There's a sci-fi radio series that he wrote.
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:43.200]   That's kind of interesting.
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:48.360]   By the way, Veronica wanted me to mention for anyone interested in Veronica and maybe
[00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:51.040]   even interested in speaking with her.
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:52.200]   She couldn't make it on the show today.
[00:33:52.200 --> 00:33:57.480]   She has a head cold, but she's actually, she's auctioning a half an hour of her time off
[00:33:57.480 --> 00:33:59.040]   to do a video chat with someone.
[00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:01.120]   She's doing humanity, huh?
[00:34:01.120 --> 00:34:02.120]   Exactly.
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:05.480]   H-U-M-A-N-E-T-Y dot com.
[00:34:05.480 --> 00:34:11.520]   And that charity goes to Child's Play, which is an awesome charity for sick children to
[00:34:11.520 --> 00:34:12.920]   get them video games.
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:18.120]   So you can hang out, talk with the co-hosts, the Sorden Laser, Core, Tekzilla.
[00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:21.240]   She does all those shows and more.
[00:34:21.240 --> 00:34:23.240]   She's the current auction right now.
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:24.520]   She is the current auction, yes.
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:25.520]   Gary Vaynerchuk is next.
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:26.520]   Felicia Day.
[00:34:26.520 --> 00:34:27.520]   Scott Born's going to do it.
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:28.520]   John C. Devorak's going to do it.
[00:34:28.520 --> 00:34:29.840]   Dick D. Bartolo did it.
[00:34:29.840 --> 00:34:30.840]   It's a really neat idea.
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:31.840]   I think this is a...
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:32.840]   Molly and I are going to do it too.
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:33.840]   Are you?
[00:34:33.840 --> 00:34:34.840]   I think I'm on the list somewhere.
[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:38.840]   Hugh H-U-M-A-N-E-T-Y dot com.
[00:34:38.840 --> 00:34:40.440]   This is like a turducken.
[00:34:40.440 --> 00:34:44.320]   We put a PSA in the middle of a commercial.
[00:34:44.320 --> 00:34:47.080]   Now all you need is a commercial in the middle of the PSA and the middle of the commercial
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:48.080]   and it will be a turducken.
[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:53.360]   Maybe I'll do a commercial for turducken in the middle of the PSA.
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:57.120]   Audible.com/twit2 for your platinum.
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:59.240]   Pick a book, two books if you want.
[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:01.560]   Anithym is a true credit book.
[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:04.960]   Boy, is that a good way to read Anithym, just to listen to it.
[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:07.840]   It's a kind of partly dramatized, it's multiple voices.
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:08.840]   Just fantastic.
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:09.840]   I've recommended it before.
[00:35:09.840 --> 00:35:10.840]   I loved it.
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:11.840]   I loved it.
[00:35:11.840 --> 00:35:12.840]   I thought it was great.
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:18.600]   It took about 100 pages to really get cruisin' and then I was sucked in and really enjoyed
[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:19.600]   it.
[00:35:19.600 --> 00:35:21.040]   I know it's a lot for some people.
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:24.320]   Some people think it's a little too pretentious and it is.
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:25.880]   But the world he created was just...
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:26.880]   I loved it.
[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:27.880]   Crazy.
[00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:30.840]   It took me 250 pages to really get into it.
[00:35:30.840 --> 00:35:33.080]   But boy, you know, it's Neil Stevenson.
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:35.920]   When you read Neil Stevenson, you say, "I'm going to take some time here.
[00:35:35.920 --> 00:35:39.320]   I'm going to spend some time with this."
[00:35:39.320 --> 00:35:40.320]   He did a masterful job.
[00:35:40.320 --> 00:35:43.120]   I'll make that our pick because that's a two credit pick.
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:48.080]   So if you go to audible.com/twit2, you can get two credits, make it this long book and
[00:35:48.080 --> 00:35:49.080]   long is right.
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:50.880]   32 hours and 30 minutes.
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:51.880]   Yeah.
[00:35:51.880 --> 00:35:52.880]   Wow.
[00:35:52.880 --> 00:35:54.400]   That's faster than I read it.
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:55.480]   Yeah, it probably is.
[00:35:55.480 --> 00:35:56.480]   I just...
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:35:57.480]   I loved that book.
[00:35:57.480 --> 00:36:02.960]   I've already read it in print, but I've downloaded the Audible version to listen to it.
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:03.960]   This is my problem.
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:04.960]   I just don't...
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:07.680]   Now I see why I don't read a lot of fictional books.
[00:36:07.680 --> 00:36:10.400]   The idea of taking 100 pages or 250 pages is just...
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.040]   I can listen through that.
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:15.840]   I could listen while in the background, but I can't read that long.
[00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:16.840]   Audible.
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:18.240]   It takes the length of the book to get into it, but then you'll love it.
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:19.240]   You'll love it at the end.
[00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:20.240]   You'll be sorry it ended.
[00:36:20.240 --> 00:36:21.240]   Yeah.
[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:22.240]   That's Tom Wolfe.
[00:36:22.240 --> 00:36:23.240]   For me, that's Tom Wolfe.
[00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:24.240]   I'll get to the end.
[00:36:24.240 --> 00:36:27.000]   I'll go, boy, I hated that book, but I'm sorry it's over.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:31.720]   Audible.com/twit2 is the URL for it.
[00:36:31.720 --> 00:36:33.480]   We thank Audible so much for their support.
[00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:36.040]   I did see that online...
[00:36:36.040 --> 00:36:37.040]   This is weird.
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:37.120]   The
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:39.120]   best thing I've ever seen is the
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:41.120]   best thing I've ever seen.
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:43.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:44.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:45.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:46.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:47.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:48.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:36:48.120 --> 00:36:49.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:50.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:51.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:36:51.120 --> 00:36:52.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:36:52.120 --> 00:36:53.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:54.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:36:54.120 --> 00:36:55.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:36:56.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:57.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:36:58.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:36:58.120 --> 00:36:59.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:00.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:01.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:02.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:37:02.120 --> 00:37:08.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:37:08.120 --> 00:37:09.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:37:09.120 --> 00:37:10.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:11.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:12.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:37:12.120 --> 00:37:13.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:37:13.120 --> 00:37:14.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:15.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:37:15.120 --> 00:37:16.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:17.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:18.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:19.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:20.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:21.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:22.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:23.120]   I think it's a good thing.

[00:37:31.120 --> 00:37:32.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:33.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:34.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:37:34.120 --> 00:37:35.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:36.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:37.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:37:37.120 --> 00:37:38.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:37:38.120 --> 00:37:39.120]   I think it's a good thing.

[00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:49.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:50.120]   I think it's a good thing.

[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:53.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:37:53.120 --> 00:37:54.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:55.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:37:56.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:57.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:37:57.120 --> 00:37:58.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:37:58.120 --> 00:37:59.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:37:59.120 --> 00:38:00.120]   I think it's a good thing.

[00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:02.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:38:02.120 --> 00:38:03.120]   I think it's a good thing.

[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:50.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:51.120]   I think it's a good thing.

[00:38:58.120 --> 00:38:59.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:00.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:39:00.120 --> 00:39:01.120]   I think it's a good thing.

[00:39:06.120 --> 00:39:07.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:39:07.120 --> 00:39:08.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:39:08.120 --> 00:39:09.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:39:09.120 --> 00:39:10.120]   I think it's a good thing.

[00:39:11.120 --> 00:39:12.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:13.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:39:13.120 --> 00:39:14.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:15.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:16.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:39:16.120 --> 00:39:17.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:39:17.120 --> 00:39:18.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:39:18.120 --> 00:39:19.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:20.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:39:20.120 --> 00:39:21.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:22.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:23.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:39:23.120 --> 00:39:24.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:25.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:39:25.120 --> 00:39:26.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:27.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:39:27.120 --> 00:39:28.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:39:28.120 --> 00:39:29.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:39:29.120 --> 00:39:30.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:31.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:32.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:39:32.120 --> 00:39:33.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:39:33.120 --> 00:39:34.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:39:34.120 --> 00:39:35.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:39:35.120 --> 00:39:36.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:37.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:38.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:39.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:39:39.120 --> 00:39:40.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:39:40.120 --> 00:39:41.120]   I think it's a good thing.
[00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:49.160]   I think the big advertisers will begin to consolidate and work with the larger, more
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:51.720]   reputable sites and networks.
[00:39:51.720 --> 00:39:57.880]   The smaller guys, I don't want to say the FM's and the publishers who are using FM.
[00:39:57.880 --> 00:40:02.400]   I think the smaller sites are going to feel the pinch harder because they're going to
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:06.840]   be viewed as a little bit riskier and they're not going to have the economies of scale that
[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:09.680]   a CNET would with millions of pages a day.
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:14.120]   I've heard that said about blogging in general, which is that blogging was originally this
[00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:19.680]   great flowering of individuals writing their thoughts online and finding an audience in
[00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:20.680]   a voice.
[00:40:20.680 --> 00:40:25.040]   I've heard that said that the big ones, the ingadgets of the world are going to swallow.
[00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:27.960]   That's the reality of any big growth.
[00:40:27.960 --> 00:40:29.080]   This is what happens everywhere.
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:33.240]   We started doing railroads 120 years ago, 130 years ago, and it blew up and there were
[00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:34.680]   little railroads everywhere.
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:36.680]   Then eventually there were three.
[00:40:36.680 --> 00:40:40.160]   Actually, all three went out of business after the Transcontinental Railroad.
[00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:43.880]   There was a big bust, very much like the dot-com bust.
[00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:44.880]   We started over.
[00:40:44.880 --> 00:40:52.160]   I can't speak specifically to how things have been within gadgets since I've left over
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:58.760]   the last few months, but I do know that the margins on a lot of publishing houses are
[00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:00.440]   so high.
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:04.720]   Your gakars and your web logzinks and so on.
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:09.480]   Even as profits start to get churned through the recession, it is a little bit harder to
[00:41:09.480 --> 00:41:12.560]   secure larger online advertising deals.
[00:41:12.560 --> 00:41:17.720]   Because the margins are so high, it's not as challenging for somebody like a gadget for
[00:41:17.720 --> 00:41:22.120]   a publication like a gadget to stick this thing through.
[00:41:22.120 --> 00:41:26.000]   But some of the publishers didn't get a bunch of people at ValleyWag, get laid off.
[00:41:26.000 --> 00:41:27.680]   Isn't Gawker struggling a little?
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:30.960]   You want my personal opinion about that.
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:32.840]   ValleyWag has been struggling for a very long time.
[00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:36.360]   It was at the bottom, or maybe second to the bottom, gakars and tire networks.
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:41.840]   It was a really easy opportunity for Nick Denton to blame the economy on what was essentially
[00:41:41.840 --> 00:41:42.840]   a failed property.
[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:45.880]   I think we're seeing a lot of that right now, which is people laying off people.
[00:41:45.880 --> 00:41:47.640]   I'm not going to put words in.
[00:41:47.640 --> 00:41:51.760]   I can say, for instance, Jason and Mahalo or Revision 3.
[00:41:51.760 --> 00:41:56.720]   But I have to say, this is a great opportunity if you wanted to lay off people to do it and
[00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:58.120]   blame it on George Bush.
[00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:02.120]   Well, the venture capitalists are telling their companies, I read this in the Economist,
[00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:05.080]   saying, "You need to cut your costs right now.
[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:07.160]   They're feeling the pressure from their backers."
[00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:08.160]   Yeah.
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:09.360]   All right, so blame it on the VCs then.
[00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:10.360]   That's even better.
[00:42:10.360 --> 00:42:11.360]   No, why not?
[00:42:11.360 --> 00:42:12.360]   The Vietcong.
[00:42:12.360 --> 00:42:14.000]   But that's typically the first round.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:21.760]   The first round is often, whether it's true or not, for a given company, those people are,
[00:42:21.760 --> 00:42:24.440]   whatever they're working on isn't as successful as everything else.
[00:42:24.440 --> 00:42:27.000]   The next round is muscle.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   That's usually the--
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   Muscle?
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   The next round of layoffs will be muscle.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   It'll be stuff that is working.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:33.400]   So instead of fast, we're going down to the bone.
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:34.400]   Right, yeah.
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:35.400]   I'm sorry.
[00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:36.400]   I was thinking Sopranos.
[00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:38.800]   I thought, "I'm going to have to lay off Tito.
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:40.680]   I want to-- I need my muscle, man."
[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:43.040]   Docker and Revision 3 can be laying off their bouncers.
[00:42:43.040 --> 00:42:44.040]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:46.840]   And then anybody can be on a show.
[00:42:46.840 --> 00:42:47.840]   Anybody?
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:48.840]   Hey, how about the new Google?
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:50.560]   What do you think about this idea?
[00:42:50.560 --> 00:42:54.800]   The Google on Thursday started allowing people.
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:58.240]   And I noticed, by the way, for instance, Mike Harrington and TechCrunch said, "Whatever
[00:42:58.240 --> 00:42:59.240]   you do, turn it off.
[00:42:59.240 --> 00:43:00.240]   Don't use it.
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:01.240]   It's terrible.
[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:02.240]   It's a bad thing."
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:05.160]   And they allowed users to eliminate search results.
[00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:09.880]   The kind of the wickification of Google that changes won't affect anybody else, just
[00:43:09.880 --> 00:43:10.880]   you.
[00:43:10.880 --> 00:43:11.880]   Well, here's the thing though, isn't they?
[00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:12.880]   But they're going to watch them.
[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:13.880]   Right.
[00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:17.000]   I mean, this is an incredible amount of information being handed back to Google.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:18.600]   It is crowdsourcing.
[00:43:18.600 --> 00:43:21.160]   People picking through and deciding, "Oh, that's bad.
[00:43:21.160 --> 00:43:22.160]   This stuff isn't good.
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:26.280]   And maybe they're not doing it with it now, but it's got to go back into the calculations
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:27.280]   over time."
[00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:28.280]   I admit that, that they're paying attention.
[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:29.280]   Yeah.
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:32.960]   This is a logical extension of the way that Google has a search engine works anyway.
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:38.360]   It's all about trying to learn what reputation means online.
[00:43:38.360 --> 00:43:42.560]   Yeah, but do you want Google to be like Dig?
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:44.440]   I mean, doesn't it look like all of this?
[00:43:44.440 --> 00:43:45.440]   I said reputation.
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:48.720]   I didn't say voting or social bookmarking or anything like that.
[00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:53.040]   The way the PageRank works is it looks for and it calculates reputation and--
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:54.400]   But this is more like voting.
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:55.400]   Based on--
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:56.400]   Yeah.
[00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:58.080]   Well, I don't know if I'd say voting per se.
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:43:59.080]   I don't know.
[00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:02.640]   I don't even know if wiki is the right word for it because if you're the only person who
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:05.240]   sees it right now, then that's not exactly a wiki.
[00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:09.360]   Yeah, the kind of founded wiki is mad because they don't call Google sites a wiki, but
[00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:10.360]   they call this a wiki.
[00:44:10.360 --> 00:44:11.360]   Search a wiki.
[00:44:11.360 --> 00:44:12.360]   That's not even a wiki.
[00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:13.360]   But anyway.
[00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:14.360]   So here's how it works.
[00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:16.280]   If you're logged into Google when you're doing a search, you're going to see results.
[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:18.720]   There'll be buttons below the links.
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:24.600]   You can up arrow it, which moves the result higher on the page for you only.
[00:44:24.600 --> 00:44:28.040]   You can exit, which says, "Don't-- I don't want to see this one anymore."
[00:44:28.040 --> 00:44:31.080]   It is very dig-like, isn't it?
[00:44:31.080 --> 00:44:32.080]   Yeah.
[00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:34.080]   Why is Mike Harrington so--
[00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:35.080]   Why is Mike Harrington so--
[00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:36.080]   That just affects your personal results.
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:37.080]   But Mike Harrington hated it.
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:42.760]   But it's going to be used as a contributing factor to people's ranks a year from now.
[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:44.280]   I think that's fine because that's great.
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:46.720]   I think it's just one variable in the algorithm.
[00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:49.200]   It's not like dig where that is the algorithm.
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:50.200]   Right.
[00:44:50.200 --> 00:44:53.400]   I mean, there's a little more to it than that, but votes are all dominant.
[00:44:53.400 --> 00:44:55.400]   I don't think Google's going to go that way.
[00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:56.400]   No, I agree.
[00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:57.400]   It went away, though.
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:44:58.400]   Is it still there?
[00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:00.960]   It's coming and going or something.
[00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:02.840]   Cheers with Mike Harrington.
[00:45:02.840 --> 00:45:07.560]   Cheers were heard across the internet earlier today, November 22nd, when Google's new search
[00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:10.480]   wiki search interface inexplicably vanished.
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:13.760]   Perhaps just maybe it was gone for good, or at least when it returned it would have an
[00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:14.760]   opt-out feature.
[00:45:14.760 --> 00:45:15.760]   Nope, neither it's back.
[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:16.760]   Wait, wait, wait.
[00:45:16.760 --> 00:45:17.760]   Now it's back.
[00:45:17.760 --> 00:45:18.760]   What cheers?
[00:45:18.760 --> 00:45:19.760]   I don't know.
[00:45:19.760 --> 00:45:20.880]   He's decided this is the bad thing.
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:24.760]   He says, "Whatever you do, don't use search wiki."
[00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:26.760]   It's not something I...
[00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:27.760]   It doesn't matter.
[00:45:27.760 --> 00:45:29.240]   You don't want to use it, don't you use it?
[00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:31.880]   He says, "Google, it wasn't broke.
[00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:35.720]   To mess with the real Google searches serious stuff, why did they do it?"
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:37.640]   But he said it all the time.
[00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:39.560]   But it's out of the way.
[00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:42.760]   It's not something that's in any way obtrusive to what you're already doing.
[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:43.760]   Here's one.
[00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:44.760]   It doesn't.
[00:45:44.760 --> 00:45:45.760]   I'm a clutter.
[00:45:45.760 --> 00:45:46.760]   It's actually really...
[00:45:46.760 --> 00:45:48.480]   I mean, they could have screwed this implementation up.
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:54.440]   And I'm not necessarily a huge fan of this service, but I don't care what all the
[00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:55.440]   vitriol is about.
[00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:56.440]   It's not all.
[00:45:56.440 --> 00:45:59.000]   Well, here's one thing that Mike says, and I don't know if it's true, but he says you
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   can't...
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   Once you turn it on, you can't turn it off.
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   Is that true?
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:03.240]   You can clear out the results.
[00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:04.560]   I don't know about turning it on.
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:06.320]   I never turned it on yet.
[00:46:06.320 --> 00:46:09.320]   Well, clearing out the results is essentially the same as turning it off.
[00:46:09.320 --> 00:46:12.160]   I mean, if it's on, then you don't use it after that.
[00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:13.160]   Right.
[00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:14.160]   Google killed Lively, too.
[00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:15.160]   As long as we're talking.
[00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:16.600]   Oh, I was so sad to hear that...
[00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:17.600]   It felt like...
[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:19.400]   I forgot what it was.
[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:20.400]   Lively, what was it?
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:22.400]   It's like their 3D world, right?
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:23.400]   It was their second place.
[00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:26.480]   It's kind of their take on second life.
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:28.760]   It was still born at best.
[00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:29.760]   It was still born.
[00:46:29.760 --> 00:46:30.760]   I mean, it was just not.
[00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:31.760]   By the way, I know.
[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:35.080]   It fell in our chat room, says Google plus dig is giggle.
[00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:37.080]   I like it.
[00:46:37.080 --> 00:46:44.760]   Let's start the giggle engine.
[00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:46.560]   Let's see here.
[00:46:46.560 --> 00:46:47.560]   Xbox 360.
[00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:49.560]   Love it or hate it.
[00:46:49.560 --> 00:46:50.560]   Love it.
[00:46:50.560 --> 00:46:51.560]   You love it?
[00:46:51.560 --> 00:46:52.560]   You must be a...
[00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:53.560]   You're a Wii guy.
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:54.560]   Me?
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:56.280]   You must be a Wii guy.
[00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:57.280]   I'm really...
[00:46:57.280 --> 00:46:58.280]   I logged on the Xbox 360.
[00:46:58.280 --> 00:46:59.280]   Are you calling my Xbox 360?
[00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:02.040]   Or you're a tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny, tiny,
