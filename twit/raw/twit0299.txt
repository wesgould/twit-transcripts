[00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:45.000]   It's time for Twit this week in Twit.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.500]   And I guess it's technology, but you know,
[00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:51.300]   so self-retroential that it might be really this week in Twit.
[00:01:51.300 --> 00:01:53.000]   Hey, look who's here, speaking of Twit,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.200]   the man who is our host on Mac Break Weekly.
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:01:58.700]   So is the producer of Mac Break, Mr. Alex,
[00:01:58.700 --> 00:02:00.500]   what's windsy of the Pixel Goa?
[00:02:00.500 --> 00:02:04.000]   Hello, hello, I wandered over.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   Hello, Alex.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Great to have you.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   We see all the time on Tuesdays for...
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Right, there's a lot of people right now that are confused.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Yeah, wait a minute.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   That's it.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Mac Break Weekly, see.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.500]   No, it's good to have you, I think.
[00:02:15.500 --> 00:02:17.000]   There's a lot to talk about this week.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.500]   In fact, that's why we brought in a token British person.
[00:02:21.500 --> 00:02:24.500]   Mr. Will Harris from ChannelFlip.com, I will.
[00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:27.500]   There's only one thing to talk about this week, Leo.
[00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:31.000]   We all know, and that is that dress, the dress.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.500]   The dress that fluttered a thousand hearts.
[00:02:33.500 --> 00:02:38.000]   What about the hat, the hat that made a people go, "What?"
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   I saw that somebody started a Twitter account for the hat.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Do you purchase Beatrice's hat?
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Which I thought was...
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.500]   I'm going to follow Beatrice's hat.
[00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.500]   That's good.
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:48.500]   She's the one who had the...
[00:02:48.500 --> 00:02:49.500]   It had like a little loopy things.
[00:02:49.500 --> 00:02:51.500]   They're kind of like antlers.
[00:02:51.500 --> 00:02:54.500]   If you follow it, you're kind of legally obliged to shoot it afterwards.
[00:02:54.500 --> 00:02:58.500]   But there's a lot of competition in the UK, isn't it, over hats?
[00:02:58.500 --> 00:03:02.900]   Yes, and there was a big controversy because the wife of the British Prime Minister arrived
[00:03:02.900 --> 00:03:04.500]   not wearing a hat.
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:09.000]   And some thought this was kind of refreshingly modern, and some thought it was downright
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   insolent.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   So that's been a little micro-controversy.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   I just think it's kind of odd for somebody to wear such a flamboyant hat.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Doesn't she upstage just a little bit to the...
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.500]   Yeah, no, exactly.
[00:03:24.500 --> 00:03:28.000]   But then the bride was almost upstage by her own sister.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   So that was a close run thing as well.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Look at that hat.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   That's a lot of hat.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   That's a strangest thing.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   One on the right.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   The thing is, you have to do the Lady Gaga makeup if you're going to wear a hat like that.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   You can't just put the eyeliner in some gloss.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   You've got to go for it.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Yeah, she was kind of getting to Gaga and kind of hit just...
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Gaga.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Gaga.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Lowercase.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Lowercase.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Gaga.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   Wow.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:00.080]   Well, anyway, now we know what the royals really are thinking about is where they can get
[00:04:00.080 --> 00:04:03.320]   a better hat, a better deal on a hat.
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:06.000]   So I guess I should do some royal wedding news.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.280]   I mean, nobody in the tech industry really cares.
[00:04:08.280 --> 00:04:10.280]   I have to say, I...
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.280]   I do.
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.280]   Oh, really?
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:18.080]   Well, then you're confirming my very sexist tweet in which I said the royal wedding is
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:20.160]   the Steve Jobs keynote for girls.
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:22.160]   Yeah, Clayton Reese.
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.160]   Yeah, that was...
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.640]   I totally agree.
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:28.200]   I was up at 4 a.m. and I kept running in the bedroom thing.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.200]   Wake up, she's getting in the car and he was like, stop doing that.
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:34.200]   I was like, would you please close the door?
[00:04:34.200 --> 00:04:36.400]   She's like, it's a fairy tale.
[00:04:36.400 --> 00:04:39.800]   One moment she's going from becoming a commoner.
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.560]   Now she's going to be royalty.
[00:04:41.560 --> 00:04:42.560]   I'm like, would you...
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:45.200]   It's 4 in the morning, would you get the hell out of the bedroom from her?
[00:04:45.200 --> 00:04:46.640]   She's in Duchess now, right?
[00:04:46.640 --> 00:04:48.600]   What is she's Duchess something or other?
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.600]   Duchess of Cambridge.
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.600]   It's a Cambridge.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:51.600]   Duchess of Cambridge.
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:53.400]   It's important.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:56.600]   Speaking as an oxonian will, does that bother you?
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:04:59.760]   No, because neither of them went to walk through a Cambridge.
[00:04:59.760 --> 00:05:02.600]   She's Duchess of Cambridge, the place rather than Cambridge University.
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:04.120]   So that doesn't really bother me.
[00:05:04.120 --> 00:05:05.120]   I have a question.
[00:05:05.120 --> 00:05:07.120]   Does she change her last name?
[00:05:07.120 --> 00:05:08.120]   Yes.
[00:05:08.120 --> 00:05:10.800]   Yes, she's Windsor.
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:12.800]   OK, Windsor.
[00:05:12.800 --> 00:05:15.960]   But even the winners don't use Windsor or Saxe-Koburg.
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:18.040]   Not really, they kind of just use R.
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:19.960]   R, I'm Elizabeth.
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:21.960]   You don't need to know any more than that.
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:22.960]   She's like Prince.
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.400]   R, she's like Elvis.
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:27.240]   She's like, you know...
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.280]   The Queen is like Elvis.
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.280]   There we go.
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.720]   She's in the one name camp.
[00:05:31.720 --> 00:05:34.560]   There are only a few people who are in that camp.
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.760]   Lady Gaga, that's two names.
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:36.760]   See, that doesn't...
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:37.760]   Sting.
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:38.760]   There you go.
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:39.760]   Madonna.
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:40.760]   Madonna.
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:41.760]   There you go.
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:42.760]   Leo.
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:43.760]   Leo.
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.760]   I am the Leo.
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.840]   You know, if you do Leo now on Google, you can't...
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:47.840]   Second.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:51.400]   I know, Matt, I used to come up fourth though, so it's an improvement.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.400]   Because when you Google Leo...
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:58.680]   When you get Leo horoscope, is the horoscope still beats me.
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.760]   I'm lobbying for a change to the name of that Sun sign.
[00:06:02.760 --> 00:06:04.400]   Let's call it, I don't know, Leo Vitch.
[00:06:04.400 --> 00:06:06.120]   And then that way I won't have to worry about it.
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:07.120]   Hey, there is tech news.
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:08.120]   Talk about it.
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:11.160]   Well, you know, all right, wait a minute.
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.400]   There is royal tech news.
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:19.520]   So true to what anybody expected, the royal wedding did, in fact, break streaming records.
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:20.960]   Lots of people watched it online.
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:23.160]   Is that any surprise?
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:26.000]   300,000 concurrent views.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.440]   That was 1.6 million at its peak.
[00:06:29.440 --> 00:06:31.840]   Well, this is live stream.
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:33.280]   So there were different streamers, right?
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.920]   So you can add it all together.
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:35.920]   Okay.
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:38.320]   Total, unique viewers on live stream.
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:39.320]   2 million.
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:45.160]   Live stream was doing the CBS Entertainment Tonight Associated Press, UK Press Association
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.160]   of Coverage.
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:49.800]   Akamai said that it did more streaming.
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:54.440]   Akamai is a CDN, a content distribution network.
[00:06:54.440 --> 00:06:58.560]   So it serves a lot of people, including probably all of these other guys.
[00:06:58.560 --> 00:07:00.960]   Akamai said that they had...
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.120]   Let me find the story again.
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:05.920]   Somehow got replaced by Beatrice's hat.
[00:07:05.920 --> 00:07:09.760]   Akamai said that 4.6 million page...
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.600]   Every time.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.600]   Every time.
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.600]   Princess area.
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:17.000]   4.6 million page views per minute on the news site.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   Akamai...
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:24.600]   Dead say, though, this fell well short of the 10.3 million page views per minute of the presidential
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:28.560]   election victory for Barack Obama.
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:29.560]   And...
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:30.560]   Oh, no, I'm sorry.
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:34.460]   That was election victory, but falling short to the World Cup Qualifying Match.
[00:07:34.460 --> 00:07:35.460]   Yes.
[00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:36.460]   Yeah, be it the president.
[00:07:36.460 --> 00:07:37.460]   Yeah, be it the world calculation.
[00:07:37.460 --> 00:07:38.460]   Number...
[00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.440]   Number two, three, four, five on the list.
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:41.440]   Right.
[00:07:41.440 --> 00:07:43.540]   And the longest Wimbledon match in history.
[00:07:43.540 --> 00:07:44.540]   Hmm.
[00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:46.400]   Oh, I see.
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:51.800]   So the record for streaming was set last June during the World Cup Qualifying Match and
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:55.120]   the longest Wimbledon match in history, both happening at the same time.
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.360]   That's when the internet just went...
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:07:58.360]   Gaga.
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:07:59.360]   Compost.
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:04.720]   Everyone was saying, well, this will be the ultimate test of the internet on Friday during
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:05.720]   this...
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:11.440]   During this coverage, would it be able to hold up to the girth of people going there to watch
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.600]   this live stream, people like Natalie tuning in?
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:19.840]   But does it show where around the world the most people were watching these live streams?
[00:08:19.840 --> 00:08:25.280]   I think probably the reason it held up is because most of the US was asleep.
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.280]   Right.
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:27.280]   Yeah.
[00:08:27.280 --> 00:08:28.280]   Right.
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:35.280]   I also wonder how the cellular phone coverage held up there because they probably would have
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:38.880]   heard if one of the coverage like orange had stopped out and there wasn't...
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:45.280]   You weren't able to get your MMS across of the hat and Lady Louise or whoever.
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:52.560]   Lady Beatrice, we do know that tweeting volume was heaviest in London, New York, Toronto,
[00:08:52.560 --> 00:08:57.080]   New South Wales, Paris and San Paolo in that order.
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:03.960]   The sentiment, according to a trenderer, which keeps track of this stuff, was mostly positive,
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:09.880]   58% positive, 24% of tweets registered as neutral, 18% saying, get this thing off my
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:16.880]   Twitter, 64% of them from women, 36% from men.
[00:09:16.880 --> 00:09:19.840]   That adds up to 100%.
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:21.720]   So I guess there's no third choice.
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:22.720]   Members of the royal way.
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:23.720]   Oh, sometimes children.
[00:09:23.720 --> 00:09:24.720]   Children.
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:25.720]   Members of the...
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:26.720]   Wait, how much percent?
[00:09:26.720 --> 00:09:30.320]   It's a two thirds women, one third men.
[00:09:30.320 --> 00:09:31.800]   That's not what you...
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:36.280]   There was also a top trending Twitter topic this week, by the way, as a result of largely
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:41.720]   from the royal wedding, which was the hashtag, please shut up if it was.
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:44.360]   It was one of the top trending topics.
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:48.760]   Please shut up if, and one of the things was if you have no respect for Prince William
[00:09:48.760 --> 00:09:51.600]   and Kate or any of the royals, please shut up.
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:52.600]   Shut up.
[00:09:52.600 --> 00:09:53.600]   Just shut up.
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:09:54.600]   I think that actually was from the queen.
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:55.600]   Yeah, Clayton.
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:56.600]   Yeah, Clayton.
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:10:03.520]   Top hashtags, by the way, at the peak, all of the Twitter trends were the royal wedding.
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:08.520]   Also, we didn't really couch this at the top of the show, but Clayton and I, for those
[00:10:08.520 --> 00:10:10.440]   of us listening, are married.
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:11.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:14.560]   I might jab him a few more times than the other kids.
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:16.680]   They're the battling bicker-sins of Twitter.
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:17.680]   And bad, but...
[00:10:17.680 --> 00:10:19.760]   Not only are they married, they have a lovely child.
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.800]   Where is your child's name?
[00:10:21.800 --> 00:10:24.280]   Oh, we just gave him a little shot of whiskey.
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:25.280]   Oh, God.
[00:10:25.280 --> 00:10:26.280]   Sweet.
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:29.600]   He just, we actually kept him up longer on purpose today.
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:33.360]   We did not give you a nap today, so you can sleep during Twitter.
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:34.360]   So he's actually...
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:37.600]   Hey, he's joining a large number of people who sleep during Twitter.
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.120]   Don't knock it.
[00:10:40.120 --> 00:10:45.720]   One million mentions of the hashtag #PoundRoyalWedding.
[00:10:45.720 --> 00:10:50.160]   There is in a place where you could find out what the canonical, like the official...
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:52.960]   There's no official hashtag for anything, is there?
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:53.960]   No.
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:58.200]   Like a place where you can find it, like a verified hashtag.
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.200]   Yeah.
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:02.600]   Like, I want to know, well, should I do #PoundRW?
[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:05.520]   Shall I do #PoundTheEventOfTheCentury?
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:09.520]   Kate and Will's, what should I pound?
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:11.280]   I guess I had the tag.
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.280]   Go ahead, Will.
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:15.960]   I said, Jeff, you just knock that one down right there.
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:16.960]   Yes.
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.960]   What shall I pound?
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:24.560]   42% of all the royal wedding related tweets came from the website, Twitter.com, 39% from
[00:11:24.560 --> 00:11:26.040]   mobile devices.
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:31.240]   Remember Twitter shutting is really trying to shut down these third-party mobile platforms
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:32.680]   like Uber Media.
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:37.280]   They want everything to come from their official clients.
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.920]   But really, I mean, look at this.
[00:11:38.920 --> 00:11:44.680]   More than a plurality came from the Twitter website where you see all the ads, all the
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:45.680]   trends.
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:48.860]   I wonder if that had to do with a lot of people watching the live stream, and it just can
[00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:49.860]   be in it if you're watching the Twitter.
[00:11:49.860 --> 00:11:52.760]   Oh, you're already there to tweet.
[00:11:52.760 --> 00:11:56.380]   Top hashtags #PoundRW, #W21.
[00:11:56.380 --> 00:12:00.980]   It says here, according to Mashable, the official royal wedding hashtag.
[00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:06.140]   And one of the other top hashtags, almost the same day, was I left you because.
[00:12:06.140 --> 00:12:09.780]   You're such a romantic lady.
[00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:14.140]   I was saying it was honestly, it was one of the top trending hashtags.
[00:12:14.140 --> 00:12:15.140]   You know, wait a minute.
[00:12:15.140 --> 00:12:16.140]   We started the show.
[00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:17.140]   We started the show.
[00:12:17.140 --> 00:12:19.300]   I introduced Alex and then the whole thing fell apart.
[00:12:19.300 --> 00:12:20.660]   Let me introduce the rest of our panel.
[00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:23.020]   We did say hello, Alex from the Pixel Core.
[00:12:23.020 --> 00:12:28.260]   We did say hello from Channel Flip to Mr. Will Harris because he's our official wedding
[00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:29.260]   commentary.
[00:12:29.260 --> 00:12:30.260]   Royal wedding correspondent.
[00:12:30.260 --> 00:12:31.260]   Yeah.
[00:12:31.260 --> 00:12:33.060]   But I neglected to say hello to Natalie and Clayton Morris.
[00:12:33.060 --> 00:12:37.540]   Natalie Morris, it's great to have you on your first day of freedom.
[00:12:37.540 --> 00:12:39.140]   Yeah, it is.
[00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:42.300]   I don't have to write loaded today because someone else is doing it tomorrow.
[00:12:42.300 --> 00:12:45.860]   I'm formerly of CNET and CBS Interactive.
[00:12:45.860 --> 00:12:51.820]   So you announced that you were leaving some time ago, but your last loaded was yesterday.
[00:12:51.820 --> 00:12:52.820]   It was Friday.
[00:12:52.820 --> 00:12:53.820]   Yeah.
[00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:54.820]   Wow.
[00:12:54.820 --> 00:12:55.820]   How does that feel?
[00:12:55.820 --> 00:12:59.660]   Liberating and scary and good.
[00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:01.620]   It feels really good actually.
[00:13:01.620 --> 00:13:04.660]   You haven't really said exactly what's happening.
[00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:05.980]   Are you taking another job?
[00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:07.620]   Do we know what you're doing?
[00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.460]   No, I haven't found another job yet.
[00:13:10.460 --> 00:13:14.100]   There is the hope of another job.
[00:13:14.100 --> 00:13:15.100]   None, none.
[00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:17.020]   So you do want a job yet?
[00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:18.020]   You do.
[00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:19.020]   Do you want a full time job?
[00:13:19.020 --> 00:13:21.540]   Because I can offer you a very part time job.
[00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:27.220]   Actually, you know, I'm kind of seeing what the universe has available for me because I
[00:13:27.220 --> 00:13:30.300]   want something that's flexible so that I can take care of my boys.
[00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:34.420]   That's exactly what I was telling my business partner, Lisa canceled just the other day.
[00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:40.180]   I bet she wants a job where she could take care of her boys, have more time for herself
[00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:42.180]   and yet still be in the limelight.
[00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:45.060]   Well, I don't know how important the limelight is.
[00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:46.060]   No, I can't.
[00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:47.060]   We rephrase that.
[00:13:47.060 --> 00:13:50.500]   Still perform your duties as a reporter.
[00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:52.460]   You know, so I think about this.
[00:13:52.460 --> 00:13:56.780]   Like, I am an on-air personality.
[00:13:56.780 --> 00:14:02.660]   And so I'm constantly asking myself how much I care about putting my face as a part of
[00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:05.580]   my journalism or do I just want to write?
[00:14:05.580 --> 00:14:10.420]   And I feel like I kind of, you know, I got to stick with the face thing for a little bit
[00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:13.420]   longer and then someday people won't want to see my face.
[00:14:13.420 --> 00:14:15.260]   So maybe I'll do it for a little longer.
[00:14:15.260 --> 00:14:19.860]   But there is the hope that or the possibility that maybe I just write because that's how
[00:14:19.860 --> 00:14:23.980]   I started my career as a writer, not as a TV person.
[00:14:23.980 --> 00:14:27.500]   So but I'm interviewing for TV jobs as well as writing jobs.
[00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:33.220]   And I've got some freelance work as well that I'm working on with Consumer Reports
[00:14:33.220 --> 00:14:34.220]   and Forbes.
[00:14:34.220 --> 00:14:35.220]   Oh, that's great.
[00:14:35.220 --> 00:14:36.220]   Yeah.
[00:14:36.220 --> 00:14:39.940]   So it was really just that you hated CBS and that's why you left.
[00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:41.940]   I'm going to take the message.
[00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:42.940]   I'm asking.
[00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:45.380]   That's the Donald Trump question, right?
[00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:46.380]   Yeah.
[00:14:46.380 --> 00:14:48.420]   I'll give you the thumbs up for that one.
[00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:52.500]   No, but I mean, that's what it sounds like now is that you just didn't want to work there
[00:14:52.500 --> 00:14:53.500]   anymore.
[00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:55.500]   You want to work somewhere, but not there.
[00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:59.860]   I'm going to not say much more about that.
[00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:05.020]   Whatever Tom said, but as Tom and Jason, what I'm like, he's like, you know, I mean,
[00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:08.780]   doing a show, I mean, you know, from doing broadcasting for so long, Leo, when you do
[00:15:08.780 --> 00:15:12.940]   a show for so long and, you know, when you don't have, you don't really don't have
[00:15:12.940 --> 00:15:14.500]   any producers to help you.
[00:15:14.500 --> 00:15:17.020]   And so you're writing a show every day and it's incumbent.
[00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:21.540]   You don't see that really changing that structure really changing and I don't want to put words
[00:15:21.540 --> 00:15:24.500]   in her mouth, but you know, it's get exhausted.
[00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:30.880]   This guy, Clayton Morris is Natalie's husband, the father of her child and the host of Fox
[00:15:30.880 --> 00:15:34.780]   and Friends as well as a podcaster, a prolific podcaster.
[00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:37.020]   Yeah, we've got God.
[00:15:37.020 --> 00:15:38.220]   This has been great.
[00:15:38.220 --> 00:15:41.860]   We're trying to build this sort of lifestyle network around some of the shows.
[00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:45.020]   We've got a bunch of parenting shows that we're doing.
[00:15:45.020 --> 00:15:46.420]   It's a grizzly production.
[00:15:46.420 --> 00:15:51.460]   So we've got our flagship show, grizzly, Barret Cafe, but we've got Natalie just launched
[00:15:51.460 --> 00:15:57.340]   a new show on our nascent network, Mommy Beta, which is a show with four new moms.
[00:15:57.340 --> 00:15:58.780]   We've got our daddy on board show.
[00:15:58.780 --> 00:16:00.220]   So we're, you know, we're having fun.
[00:16:00.220 --> 00:16:01.220]   Really?
[00:16:01.220 --> 00:16:02.220]   That's what you should be doing, right?
[00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:03.540]   Is doing your own thing.
[00:16:03.540 --> 00:16:04.540]   Why not, you know?
[00:16:04.540 --> 00:16:09.180]   Right, and Clayton and I have a show called The Trending Show where we run down the things
[00:16:09.180 --> 00:16:11.740]   that are trending on Google search terms and on Twitter.
[00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:16.220]   So that's why he knows all these hashtags is from our trending show.
[00:16:16.220 --> 00:16:17.980]   Our hashtag expert Clayton Morris.
[00:16:17.980 --> 00:16:19.980]   Yeah, please shut up.
[00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:20.980]   Please shut up.
[00:16:20.980 --> 00:16:21.980]   Please shut up.
[00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:27.740]   I left you because, but not only does he, not only does he know about him, but apparently
[00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:31.540]   he participates because I see and I left you because tweet from you, Clayton.
[00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:36.100]   I left you because you wouldn't join me at Baskin Robbins for their free 31 cents scoop
[00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:39.660]   at the overnight, which was also trending on Wednesday night.
[00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:43.020]   No, I think that really, I would, I think that's great.
[00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:44.900]   I encourage you to do that.
[00:16:44.900 --> 00:16:48.740]   Everybody who works at mainstream media fantasizes about doing their own thing and controlling
[00:16:48.740 --> 00:16:49.740]   it 100%.
[00:16:49.740 --> 00:16:51.100]   Leo would never do that though.
[00:16:51.100 --> 00:16:53.060]   I personally couldn't afford to.
[00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:56.900]   So, yeah, no, actually, I'm just trying to build a mainstream media outlet so I could
[00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.380]   tell other people what to do.
[00:16:58.380 --> 00:16:59.380]   I'm curious to find it.
[00:16:59.380 --> 00:17:04.380]   I mean, there's so many people who listen to your shows and find what you do so, so inspiring
[00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:08.900]   and at the same time, perhaps liberating, but because you're running the day to day operations
[00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:11.380]   of everything, do you find it as liberating?
[00:17:11.380 --> 00:17:15.820]   Well, as Merlin man says, Merlin man says, you always are working for a man, you're working
[00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:16.820]   for the man somehow.
[00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:17.820]   Are you working for yourself?
[00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:20.380]   Well, yeah, if you're the man that's even worse, right?
[00:17:20.380 --> 00:17:21.380]   Right.
[00:17:21.380 --> 00:17:24.700]   No, I think that there's, it's unbalanced much.
[00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:28.020]   It's far preferable to do your own thing.
[00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:29.260]   Don't you think everybody?
[00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:33.540]   And then what I try to do now, obviously now in order to grow, we've had a higher people
[00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:37.620]   and used people and you could speak to this as well, Will, because you're running Channel
[00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:44.620]   Flip, which is also a broadcast style operation on the internet, that what happens is you
[00:17:44.620 --> 00:17:49.020]   do hire people and then they're complaining because they don't have full control.
[00:17:49.020 --> 00:17:51.860]   So what I've tried to do is do, it's almost the United Artists model.
[00:17:51.860 --> 00:17:55.700]   I remember in Charlie Chaplin and Mary Pickford and Douglas Fairbanks formed a movie studio
[00:17:55.700 --> 00:18:02.620]   because they were unhappy with being told what to do in the old style movie system,
[00:18:02.620 --> 00:18:04.420]   the contract player system.
[00:18:04.420 --> 00:18:08.540]   And so they form United Artists and the whole idea is it's almost a co-op of performers.
[00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:10.380]   And that's what I've been trying to do here.
[00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:14.900]   So the people have a sense of at least owning their own destiny, somewhat.
[00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:16.420]   So it's very loose here.
[00:18:16.420 --> 00:18:19.860]   But yeah, there's burdens Clayton, you know, you have to write checks and stuff, but it's
[00:18:19.860 --> 00:18:22.260]   not, it's still far preferable, I think.
[00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:23.260]   Yeah.
[00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:24.260]   So go for it, Grizzly.
[00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:25.260]   Go for it.
[00:18:25.260 --> 00:18:26.260]   We're having fun, you know.
[00:18:26.260 --> 00:18:27.740]   I think that's great.
[00:18:27.740 --> 00:18:29.540]   Until I have to start writing checks.
[00:18:29.540 --> 00:18:32.740]   Yeah, well as long as it's your wife, it's free, right?
[00:18:32.740 --> 00:18:33.740]   Right.
[00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:34.740]   That's the beauty.
[00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:39.180]   I would encourage all of you out there to hire your wives.
[00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:43.900]   I tried to, but Jennifer wanted so much money.
[00:18:43.900 --> 00:18:45.780]   I couldn't afford it.
[00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:48.660]   So I was just speaking of the Google, I was just looking at Google and they've got an
[00:18:48.660 --> 00:18:51.540]   interesting Google Doodle on here.
[00:18:51.540 --> 00:18:53.420]   Let me, let me pull this up.
[00:18:53.420 --> 00:18:54.900]   Anyway, welcome Clayton and Natalie.
[00:18:54.900 --> 00:19:00.180]   It's great to have you and Natalie, great to have you on your first day of, or second
[00:19:00.180 --> 00:19:01.180]   day of freedom.
[00:19:01.180 --> 00:19:02.180]   Thank you.
[00:19:02.180 --> 00:19:03.980]   I'm just thrilled that I'm still relevant.
[00:19:03.980 --> 00:19:04.980]   Oh, you weren't.
[00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:08.140]   That's the one thing that is the scariest as you leave a big network like CBS and you
[00:19:08.140 --> 00:19:09.860]   realize, wow, this has a lot of gravitas.
[00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:11.900]   It puts a lot of weight behind my name.
[00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:16.020]   Now I'm just kind of freelance technology journalist.
[00:19:16.020 --> 00:19:19.780]   So you just hope that you continue to continue to be relevant.
[00:19:19.780 --> 00:19:21.740]   I think the world is freelance these days.
[00:19:21.740 --> 00:19:26.700]   I really think increasingly the idea of working for a company seems very outmoded.
[00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:27.700]   Yeah.
[00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:31.740]   I mean, that's kind of the model that we've kind of built around a lot of stuff.
[00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:32.740]   It's a lot of stuff.
[00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:33.740]   Yeah.
[00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:38.020]   Very, very small core number of people who kind of keep everything pulled together and
[00:19:38.020 --> 00:19:41.940]   then lots and lots and lots of freelancers that are working.
[00:19:41.940 --> 00:19:44.340]   So I was mentioning this new Google Doodle.
[00:19:44.340 --> 00:19:45.340]   This is wild.
[00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:47.340]   I don't know really what they're celebrating, but look at this.
[00:19:47.340 --> 00:19:48.940]   It's a magnifying glass.
[00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:52.340]   Yeah, go over to the dancer on the far right in the little window.
[00:19:52.340 --> 00:19:54.140]   Isn't it dancers dancing?
[00:19:54.140 --> 00:19:55.740]   Oh, they're dancing.
[00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:56.740]   Wow.
[00:19:56.740 --> 00:19:58.540]   This is to show off obviously HTML5.
[00:19:58.540 --> 00:20:00.140]   Yeah, it's made it.
[00:20:00.140 --> 00:20:02.140]   You think this is for made it because happy made it.
[00:20:02.140 --> 00:20:04.340]   Yeah, because it's at least like a fair grand.
[00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:05.940]   Well, they'll tell us.
[00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:08.940]   No, it's the 160th anniversary of the first World's Fair.
[00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:10.300]   They're not taking it back.
[00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:12.180]   They pick weird ass stuff to celebrate on here.
[00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:13.660]   Now it's different in England though, isn't it?
[00:20:13.660 --> 00:20:15.060]   I mean, this is America, Google.
[00:20:15.060 --> 00:20:17.020]   No, we have it as well.
[00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:19.420]   You've got Google in England.
[00:20:19.420 --> 00:20:22.420]   Yeah, it's crazy.
[00:20:22.420 --> 00:20:24.220]   Like there's like a whole different extension.
[00:20:24.220 --> 00:20:27.220]   There's like a different domain, but somehow it's kind of the same.
[00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:30.420]   No, I was just obviously I was being somewhat facetious.
[00:20:30.420 --> 00:20:35.420]   I know you have Google and now I understand you have automobile as well, which is exciting.
[00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:37.420]   That's the first one.
[00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:39.820]   They're all driving on the wrong side of the road.
[00:20:39.820 --> 00:20:42.620]   They haven't figured that part out yet, but we'll cut them some slack.
[00:20:42.620 --> 00:20:43.620]   They're new to it.
[00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:45.620]   We also have hashtags.
[00:20:45.620 --> 00:20:46.620]   Yes.
[00:20:46.620 --> 00:20:49.620]   And like you guys, you have pound tags, which is a little bit weird.
[00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:51.020]   We call them hashtags too here.
[00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:53.020]   Yeah, but then you say pound something.
[00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:54.020]   Because nobody knows.
[00:20:54.020 --> 00:20:56.020]   You say hash royal wedding?
[00:20:56.020 --> 00:20:57.020]   Yeah.
[00:20:57.020 --> 00:20:58.020]   No, oh, I know.
[00:20:58.020 --> 00:20:59.020]   Oh, I know.
[00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:00.020]   And the sign is a hash.
[00:21:00.020 --> 00:21:01.020]   What's a pound sign?
[00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:02.020]   This is the same thing as a hash.
[00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:06.020]   No, the pound sign is a dollar sign.
[00:21:06.020 --> 00:21:10.100]   Oh, well to us, hash is something you make out of corn beef.
[00:21:10.100 --> 00:21:11.100]   So there.
[00:21:11.100 --> 00:21:12.100]   Or something you call it.
[00:21:12.100 --> 00:21:13.100]   Or something you call it.
[00:21:13.100 --> 00:21:14.100]   To us, hash is something you smoke.
[00:21:14.100 --> 00:21:15.100]   So there.
[00:21:15.100 --> 00:21:16.100]   So there.
[00:21:16.100 --> 00:21:21.740]   What is it that Winston Churchill said the US and the UK are two countries separated
[00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:23.580]   by the same language?
[00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:26.340]   That's pretty good.
[00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:28.780]   And by a very special choice.
[00:21:28.780 --> 00:21:32.220]   I was saying that about the royal wedding this week, which is that when people complain
[00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:35.700]   about the royals, I always just said like without the royal family, England would just
[00:21:35.700 --> 00:21:38.900]   be a slightly rubbish a version of America.
[00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:45.860]   We just interrupted Will with a kiss.
[00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:47.020]   So I think that was the moment though.
[00:21:47.020 --> 00:21:48.620]   Wasn't it the most the biggest?
[00:21:48.620 --> 00:21:49.620]   That's when everybody was watching.
[00:21:49.620 --> 00:21:52.100]   That was everyone to see in the speech on the balcony.
[00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:53.100]   Yeah.
[00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:54.100]   All right.
[00:21:54.100 --> 00:21:56.940]   And that was also the shot with a little girl put her hand over ears.
[00:21:56.940 --> 00:21:58.140]   Yes, they cut that out.
[00:21:58.140 --> 00:22:01.140]   But that's so that's the other thing you're trying to find is what is the big internet
[00:22:01.140 --> 00:22:04.100]   meme for the royal wedding, you know?
[00:22:04.100 --> 00:22:05.100]   And there's a couple.
[00:22:05.100 --> 00:22:06.100]   I have to find one.
[00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:07.700]   I don't know if I need a little girl.
[00:22:07.700 --> 00:22:08.700]   Yeah, it was so cute.
[00:22:08.700 --> 00:22:09.700]   Because it went off without a hitch.
[00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:11.500]   The rest of it was was great.
[00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:13.660]   There was no other little thing that was worth talking about.
[00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:17.260]   The little girl was all people could, you know, all the like newspapers like the Sun
[00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:18.980]   or the New York Post could lay them on to.
[00:22:18.980 --> 00:22:21.620]   Yeah, there was nothing really else to talk about.
[00:22:21.620 --> 00:22:26.780]   It's funny what was trending on the day of the wedding was Kate Middleton, Kate Middleton
[00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:30.060]   wedding, Pippa.
[00:22:30.060 --> 00:22:31.060]   What else?
[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:35.420]   The Queen royal wedding, but nowhere was the groom or Prince Charles mentioned no one
[00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:36.420]   cares at all.
[00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:37.420]   Of course.
[00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:40.260]   And he's the whole reason that she becomes royalty, but really.
[00:22:40.260 --> 00:22:41.260]   Wow.
[00:22:41.260 --> 00:22:43.940]   He's got that that that Windsor horse face.
[00:22:43.940 --> 00:22:44.940]   So it's not.
[00:22:44.940 --> 00:22:45.940]   No.
[00:22:45.940 --> 00:22:46.940]   Oh, come on.
[00:22:46.940 --> 00:22:47.940]   You think he's handsome?
[00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:48.940]   He's got a Habsburg chin.
[00:22:48.940 --> 00:22:51.020]   Yeah, he's not as handsome as Harry.
[00:22:51.020 --> 00:22:54.180]   Oh, well, I think he's I don't know.
[00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:55.180]   He looks like his mom.
[00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:57.220]   So here's the say that he's endearing.
[00:22:57.220 --> 00:23:01.420]   Here's the the bit of the picture that they usually cut out is this is this little girl
[00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:02.420]   here.
[00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:06.780]   And so that's become a new a new internet meme.
[00:23:06.780 --> 00:23:08.220]   She's awesome.
[00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:12.100]   There she is with the Donald.
[00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:13.660]   That's really that's quite good.
[00:23:13.660 --> 00:23:18.620]   I just hope it doesn't damage the rest of your life is going to be about you're the
[00:23:18.620 --> 00:23:19.620]   girl who.
[00:23:19.620 --> 00:23:21.940]   Well, she's the new people.
[00:23:21.940 --> 00:23:24.420]   She is that is that Pippa?
[00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:29.780]   Who is that Natalie Morris, our royal wedding correspondent.
[00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:35.820]   I thought it was Lady Louise, the daughter of Prince Edward, but I'm not sure.
[00:23:35.820 --> 00:23:39.260]   No, the girl with the crazy hat was Prince Biatris.
[00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:40.260]   That's Beatrice.
[00:23:40.260 --> 00:23:41.260]   No, no, no, I mean that little girl.
[00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:42.260]   Who's the girl?
[00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:43.260]   Who's the little girl?
[00:23:43.260 --> 00:23:44.260]   Come on.
[00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:45.260]   You're our royal wedding commentator.
[00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:47.500]   Yeah, she's a weird name.
[00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:48.500]   She has two fans.
[00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:51.100]   And therefore we don't want to pronounce it.
[00:23:51.100 --> 00:23:52.100]   Okay.
[00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:57.980]   It's like in any sort of news read if she's got an unpronounceable name to get been cuts.
[00:23:57.980 --> 00:23:58.980]   Oh, yes.
[00:23:58.980 --> 00:23:59.980]   See, there you go.
[00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:01.580]   They don't nobody wants to say.
[00:24:01.580 --> 00:24:05.340]   They can't say.
[00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:08.740]   Well, Grace, you're a meme.
[00:24:08.740 --> 00:24:09.820]   Congratulations.
[00:24:09.820 --> 00:24:15.740]   The internet is so cold.
[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:19.740]   I think the other thing has to be the cart wheeling clergy members, isn't it?
[00:24:19.740 --> 00:24:20.740]   Oh, yeah.
[00:24:20.740 --> 00:24:25.300]   Yeah, the other big meme of the week from the wedding was the cart wheeling clergyman.
[00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:29.860]   And they had up just one of those pool cameras set up after the event and he comes down and
[00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:33.260]   he does like four cartwheels in a row.
[00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:36.180]   And presumably it's because everything went off without a hitch.
[00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:37.180]   I mean, he was excited.
[00:24:37.180 --> 00:24:44.820]   Did the cartwheels and the pool camera ended up picking up on it.
[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:47.780]   Charlie Sheen and the girl.
[00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:52.060]   We need a name for her like keyboard cat.
[00:24:52.060 --> 00:24:53.460]   Yeah, she really is.
[00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:56.220]   Like it's the shut up girl.
[00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:57.220]   Yeah.
[00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:01.300]   They call it a shut up girl.
[00:25:01.300 --> 00:25:03.540]   Flower girl.
[00:25:03.540 --> 00:25:04.820]   Anoid flower girl.
[00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:05.980]   I don't know.
[00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:09.980]   The tower can be better than I think frowning flower girl is what they're calling it in
[00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:14.860]   the today show the frowning flower girl.
[00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:16.740]   So how about that PlayStation network?
[00:25:16.740 --> 00:25:18.060]   Oh, yeah, that's right.
[00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:20.300]   Let's talk about something that actually makes it different.
[00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:23.180]   It went down because of the royal wedding.
[00:25:23.180 --> 00:25:24.340]   That's it.
[00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:27.340]   Royal wedding hackers took down the PlayStation network.
[00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:32.100]   Did anybody watch the press conference today from Japan?
[00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:34.860]   That's a bad sign when you're having a press conference on a Sunday.
[00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:39.500]   No, I tried to watch it on my PlayStation and it wouldn't be.
[00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:40.780]   I couldn't get on.
[00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:41.780]   All right.
[00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:44.780]   Well, I'm going to give you guys 60 seconds to go and watch it.
[00:25:44.780 --> 00:25:46.420]   They are the transcripts.
[00:25:46.420 --> 00:25:50.340]   I think I read read the transcripts, but we're going to take a little break and come back
[00:25:50.340 --> 00:25:51.340]   in just a moment.
[00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:53.260]   Do you want to show off some jewelry?
[00:25:53.260 --> 00:25:56.940]   Lisa, do you have some go get some jewelry?
[00:25:56.940 --> 00:25:57.940]   She's not ready.
[00:25:57.940 --> 00:25:58.940]   We'll go get the jewelry.
[00:25:58.940 --> 00:25:59.940]   We'll do it next.
[00:25:59.940 --> 00:26:00.940]   We'll do it next.
[00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:01.940]   We have some.
[00:26:01.940 --> 00:26:02.940]   Well, no, we were talking about the real wedding.
[00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:03.940]   We should do it now.
[00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:04.940]   We're talking about ice.com.
[00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:07.260]   You know about ice.com?
[00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:08.500]   Evidently, they have jewelry.
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:10.420]   That's what I'm guessing.
[00:26:10.420 --> 00:26:12.100]   Every husband Clayton.
[00:26:12.100 --> 00:26:16.260]   Yeah, Natalie, turn mute your computer because this is where I'll be ordering your mother's
[00:26:16.260 --> 00:26:17.260]   day gift.
[00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:18.260]   Oh, that's right.
[00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:19.260]   Mother's Day is May 8th.
[00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:20.260]   Let's not forget.
[00:26:20.260 --> 00:26:21.260]   Yeah.
[00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:24.660]   Every husband will hear us.

[00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:34.580]   out.

[00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:45.980]   They've got a maze.

[00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:53.660]   Isn't that beautiful?

[00:27:13.660 --> 00:27:14.660]   Look at that.
[00:27:14.660 --> 00:27:16.580]   Isn't that beautiful?

[00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:13.300]   of times, you know, you're going to spend that kind of money online.
[00:28:13.300 --> 00:28:16.020]   You're not going to want to, you want to know what you're actually buying more than
[00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:17.020]   a photo.

[00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:22.940]   I think it's so affordable.
[00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:24.420]   They also have earrings, the matching earrings.
[00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:26.020]   You could get the earrings with it.
[00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:27.820]   Wouldn't that be so cool?
[00:28:27.820 --> 00:28:28.820]   Look at that.

[00:28:30.940 --> 00:28:34.140]   We got a girl at work today telling me that she's getting a salad spinner from others
[00:28:34.140 --> 00:28:35.140]   day.
[00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:36.140]   See, don't do that.
[00:28:36.140 --> 00:28:37.140]   That's bad.
[00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:38.140]   Yeah.
[00:28:38.140 --> 00:28:39.140]   Don't do the salad spinner.
[00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:40.140]   Do the ice.com.

[00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:13.900]   Here's the pendant.
[00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:18.540]   You would like that, Natalie.
[00:29:18.540 --> 00:29:20.700]   Wouldn't you like to have Princess Diana's ring?
[00:29:20.700 --> 00:29:22.540]   I mean, it's not her actual ring.
[00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:26.020]   It's not like they took it off her finger or anything, but it's the same ring that Charles
[00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:27.020]   gave to Diana.
[00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:30.340]   Does that mean that you'll have to call me Princess Natalie?
[00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:31.340]   Yes.
[00:29:31.340 --> 00:29:32.340]   Then yes.
[00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:34.220]   Princess, no, we'll call you the Duchess.
[00:29:34.220 --> 00:29:37.460]   Do they have any crowns of the Duchess of Morris?
[00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:38.460]   Duchess of Morris.
[00:29:38.460 --> 00:29:39.460]   I wonder.
[00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:43.060]   Do they think they have tight tiara's and I'd love to have a tiara.
[00:29:43.060 --> 00:29:44.060]   Did I say that?
[00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:48.100]   I just got to be a show you talk to it.
[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:49.100]   Whoops.
[00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:50.100]   Just slipped out.
[00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:51.500]   ice.com/twit.
[00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:57.220]   So the PlayStation Network, Sony is talking about compensating users.
[00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:59.860]   Get what you get this, a month free.
[00:29:59.860 --> 00:30:01.860]   It's going to be down from them.
[00:30:01.860 --> 00:30:03.180]   Oh, thank you, Sony.
[00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:04.180]   You're so generous.
[00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:09.260]   I mean, it's only some of the zips that's going to be back this week.
[00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:11.260]   It's not even going to be fully back.
[00:30:11.260 --> 00:30:12.260]   No.
[00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:14.420]   Netflix gave a month free.
[00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:16.580]   Didn't they just like a few weeks ago?
[00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:18.620]   Only just for like a day's worth of outages.
[00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:20.220]   Yeah, because it was a little slow.
[00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:22.980]   Remember, it was a little slow coming up, so they gave you a free month.
[00:30:22.980 --> 00:30:23.980]   Yeah.
[00:30:23.980 --> 00:30:27.500]   So given that you've lost like basically two weeks by this point, it's like basically
[00:30:27.500 --> 00:30:29.340]   two months, two weeks free.
[00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:30.340]   Thanks.
[00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:34.260]   And in your credit card information, 77 million people affected by this because they didn't
[00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:36.500]   silo their information properly.
[00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:39.700]   And you know, this just speaks to, I'm curious though, I think the most egregious thing of
[00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:40.700]   all of this.
[00:30:40.700 --> 00:30:45.340]   Well, some of this after the earthquake, right, which was the Japanese response to trying
[00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:47.100]   to get out information.
[00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:49.380]   Everyone was trying to get out and get information.
[00:30:49.380 --> 00:30:53.740]   Sony said they're sending robots into decent to a decent BPSN.
[00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:54.740]   Yeah.
[00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:57.700]   And they're sort of tight-lipped about the whole thing, right?
[00:30:57.700 --> 00:30:58.700]   Why did it take a week?
[00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:02.820]   I think that's cultural that they just don't, they patent down the hatches.
[00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:03.820]   Yeah.
[00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:05.700]   I mean, we certainly saw that after the other earthquake.
[00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:10.500]   We saw that in the 1990, what was that?
[00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:13.140]   The other earthquake, I can't remember the name of the top of my head because I've been
[00:31:13.140 --> 00:31:14.140]   up since 4 AM.
[00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:16.500]   And then this earthquake, we saw the slow response.
[00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:20.500]   And then with Sony, you know, this week-long wait and see approach before they're actually
[00:31:20.500 --> 00:31:23.540]   going to release any information about the fact that your credit card information is
[00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:24.540]   out there.
[00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:25.540]   Wow.
[00:31:25.540 --> 00:31:26.540]   Yeah, that's crazy.
[00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:29.060]   They didn't admit that the credit card was out there.
[00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:30.700]   They just sent out an advisory.
[00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:32.660]   I got one saying it might be.
[00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:33.660]   We don't know.
[00:31:33.660 --> 00:31:36.780]   And, you know, how can you not know?
[00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:37.780]   It's ridiculous.
[00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:43.740]   I think there was a great quote from Kaz here, I, this afternoon saying, "These illegal attacks
[00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:46.940]   obviously highlight the widespread problem with cyber security."
[00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:48.900]   No, with your security.
[00:31:48.900 --> 00:31:50.980]   It's your problem with cyber security.
[00:31:50.980 --> 00:31:51.980]   Oh, it's everybody.
[00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:53.420]   No, it's everybody's problem.
[00:31:53.420 --> 00:31:55.140]   No, it's your problem.
[00:31:55.140 --> 00:32:01.500]   Well, you know, they've worked now with security firms to quote, "implement significant security
[00:32:01.500 --> 00:32:03.860]   measures to further detect an authorized activity."
[00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:06.300]   And it's like, "So you didn't have those in the first place?
[00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:11.660]   You didn't make me think of having best-in-class security before you even launched this thing?"
[00:32:11.660 --> 00:32:18.100]   Well, and they also said that in the conference, it was an existing vulnerability.
[00:32:18.100 --> 00:32:20.180]   I mean, they knew about it.
[00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:22.060]   They knew what the vulnerability was.
[00:32:22.060 --> 00:32:23.700]   And they wouldn't talk about what it actually...
[00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:28.420]   And they haven't said yet whether it was somebody using a hacked PlayStation 3 that got
[00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:29.420]   on the network.
[00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:31.900]   I don't know how the intrusion happened.
[00:32:31.900 --> 00:32:32.900]   The FBI is certainly involved.
[00:32:32.900 --> 00:32:35.820]   But I think that the credit card information was encrypted.
[00:32:35.820 --> 00:32:38.060]   So I think they think that it may have been accessed.
[00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:39.060]   Right.
[00:32:39.060 --> 00:32:40.460]   They just don't know if it was decrypted.
[00:32:40.460 --> 00:32:41.980]   Well, here's the deal.
[00:32:41.980 --> 00:32:47.140]   And I've learned this by doing the Security Now podcast for six years now.
[00:32:47.140 --> 00:32:51.100]   Once they get the database, it's a lot easier to brute force it.
[00:32:51.100 --> 00:32:55.740]   And if they just, for instance, encrypted it with a hash without salting, it would only
[00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:58.420]   be a matter of time before the hackers were able to decrypt it.
[00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:03.580]   Yeah, because you just start seeing all the brute force attacks and assuming that they
[00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:08.980]   haven't given what we've seen of the PlayStation network so far, it's not going to be best in
[00:33:08.980 --> 00:33:13.300]   class security with all the added two hickies that would make it hard to decrypt.
[00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:14.300]   This is just...
[00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:17.140]   Does this permanently though damage Sony in such a way where others...
[00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:18.460]   They certainly wanted...
[00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:20.300]   They certainly wanted there to be...
[00:33:20.300 --> 00:33:23.580]   You're going to go there to get your films and your music as part of this network.
[00:33:23.580 --> 00:33:26.220]   Does this permanently cause a setback for them?
[00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:28.220]   Is that what Curiosity is?
[00:33:28.220 --> 00:33:31.220]   So, PSN is the gaming network.
[00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:33.380]   And then this Curiosity, is that what that is?
[00:33:33.380 --> 00:33:35.620]   Is to share music and stuff?
[00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:37.100]   It's their music sharing site.
[00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:38.100]   It's new.
[00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:39.100]   It's right.
[00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:40.100]   It's relatively new, I think.
[00:33:40.100 --> 00:33:41.100]   Yeah, plus the film.
[00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:47.100]   Yeah, you can stream music and movies between PlayStation 3s, HDTVs, Blu-ray players, PSPs,
[00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:48.100]   that kind of thing.
[00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:52.740]   An Android device with the Sony skins.
[00:33:52.740 --> 00:33:53.740]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:33:53.740 --> 00:33:59.380]   It has to be Sony Ericsson to use it.
[00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:00.380]   I think so.
[00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:01.380]   Yeah.
[00:34:01.380 --> 00:34:02.380]   Okay.
[00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:03.380]   So they say that...
[00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:07.380]   Oh, the new Sony tablets, the new Sony tablets will also have it that we're just announced
[00:34:07.380 --> 00:34:08.380]   to speak.
[00:34:08.380 --> 00:34:09.380]   Oh, that's...
[00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:11.900]   I didn't know about that.
[00:34:11.900 --> 00:34:14.380]   I'm going to sure run out and buy a Sony tablet right about it.
[00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:15.380]   We already ordered four.
[00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:16.380]   Because you can't...
[00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:18.660]   They actually sounded like a cool thing if you...
[00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:22.660]   You know, if this hadn't happened because you can get PlayStation content, also Sony
[00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:24.660]   reader content, also...
[00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:28.660]   Yeah, it's not real PlayStation content, right?
[00:34:28.660 --> 00:34:33.100]   It's basically everything good about Sony in one tablet, unfortunately now.
[00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:35.940]   Sony's got this black mark on its face.
[00:34:35.940 --> 00:34:36.940]   I check the news.
[00:34:36.940 --> 00:34:41.860]   Difference between going to like a Ruth's Chris and going to an Outback Steakhouse.
[00:34:41.860 --> 00:34:42.860]   You get a Sony.
[00:34:42.860 --> 00:34:44.660]   Wait, who's the Ruth Chris?
[00:34:44.660 --> 00:34:45.660]   Is iPad?
[00:34:45.660 --> 00:34:46.660]   Yeah.
[00:34:46.660 --> 00:34:51.660]   Ruth Chris is iPad or you can go get a Bloom and Onion at Outback Steakhouse.
[00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:52.660]   Please.
[00:34:52.660 --> 00:34:53.660]   Right.
[00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:56.660]   Reference is entirely lost on that.
[00:34:56.660 --> 00:34:59.660]   It would be the difference between going to Ruth's...
[00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:00.660]   Fantastic.
[00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:03.980]   We should always give the competition a chance to catch up to Apple.
[00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:07.660]   Clayton and I argue about this all the time because I think he's a shameless Apple fanboy
[00:35:07.660 --> 00:35:11.660]   and I always want someone else to come to the market and give them a competition.
[00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:14.660]   I agree, competition is good even for Apple fanboys.
[00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:15.900]   And I'm not.
[00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:16.900]   I just...
[00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:18.900]   You try all of these other devices and you...
[00:35:18.900 --> 00:35:19.900]   Apple's the best.
[00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:21.900]   But coming back to the one that works.
[00:35:21.900 --> 00:35:22.900]   I'm sorry.
[00:35:22.900 --> 00:35:23.900]   No, I agree with you.
[00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:26.500]   I got a Blackberry Playbook the other day.
[00:35:26.500 --> 00:35:27.500]   Very nice.
[00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:28.500]   Great hardware.
[00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:29.500]   Really cool.
[00:35:29.500 --> 00:35:30.500]   But it's not a iPad.
[00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:32.100]   It's not going to come even close to the iPad.
[00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:33.100]   And there's little things.
[00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:35.940]   You realize that Apple's paying attention to very, very small details.
[00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:39.180]   Like I was playing with it a little bit and the first thing to hit is that when I touch
[00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:40.740]   the screen it's not always...
[00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:41.740]   The Playbook.
[00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:42.740]   On the Playbook.
[00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:45.740]   And then I was like that as an Apple user that would drive me absolutely crazy.
[00:35:45.740 --> 00:35:50.700]   My son for instance who lives on his little iPad when I allow him to, three years old,
[00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:51.700]   he wouldn't even...
[00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:53.700]   I'm sure that the Playbook would drive him crazy.
[00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:54.700]   I have to say.
[00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:55.700]   But I mean I think that that's the...
[00:35:55.700 --> 00:35:56.700]   And that's really the measure.
[00:35:56.700 --> 00:36:01.300]   You know those of us who did watch the Sony press conference, I was very grateful.
[00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:05.500]   Sony explained how the internet works in this slide here.
[00:36:05.500 --> 00:36:07.060]   And so I just think that...
[00:36:07.060 --> 00:36:08.940]   Unfortunately it was all in Japanese.
[00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:13.380]   Well apparently there's some bricks and then there's some servers and there's some more
[00:36:13.380 --> 00:36:14.380]   bricks.
[00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:16.740]   And there's some arrows that look kind of like tubes.
[00:36:16.740 --> 00:36:21.340]   Kind of like a series of tubes stacked on top of the bottom.
[00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:25.820]   Ted Stevens put this PowerPoint presentation together.
[00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:29.420]   This is their slide of what happened.
[00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:33.820]   See we've got a database firewall, database firewall, database firewall, internet.
[00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:40.420]   That's like from the episode of The It Crowd where they have that little black box and tell
[00:36:40.420 --> 00:36:41.940]   everyone that that's the internet.
[00:36:41.940 --> 00:36:45.580]   And they're like, "Don't break the internet.
[00:36:45.580 --> 00:36:47.740]   I'm holding it in my hand."
[00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:52.620]   So they said that the attackers used some sort of database tool.
[00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:54.500]   But there's not much more information about that.
[00:36:54.500 --> 00:36:57.740]   They did say it was a highly skilled intruder.
[00:36:57.740 --> 00:37:02.300]   And that Sony as soon as they realized this brought in a second security firm, emailed
[00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:06.140]   customers and then took the whole thing, the whole damn thing down because they couldn't
[00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:08.100]   figure out what was going on.
[00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:11.100]   And it's still down.
[00:37:11.100 --> 00:37:13.620]   So really the reason they brought it down was not that they knew there was intrusion.
[00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:14.900]   They just knew that there was something wrong.
[00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:17.900]   They couldn't figure out something is going sideways.
[00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:18.900]   Yeah.
[00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:21.980]   And of course once they realized what was going on, they couldn't put it back up.
[00:37:21.980 --> 00:37:27.060]   Sony says it will, "Consider paying for new credit cards if you have to get a new one."
[00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:33.820]   But their advice is not to cancel your credit cards, but to put a fraud alert on your credit
[00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:34.820]   report.
[00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:38.540]   Wait, how do they pay, why do you need to pay for a new credit card?
[00:37:38.540 --> 00:37:39.540]   It was a free.
[00:37:39.540 --> 00:37:40.940]   It's Japan.
[00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:44.580]   Sony says it will consider paying for new, maybe paying for the time.
[00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:47.100]   Paying the credit card companies for the plastic.
[00:37:47.100 --> 00:37:48.100]   I don't know.
[00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:53.860]   You know who they should pay is the companies who make Sony games that you can buy but can't
[00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:59.940]   play like Portal 2 on your PlayStation 3 because you can't activate it because the PSN is down.
[00:37:59.940 --> 00:38:05.380]   Yeah, I mean that's really, that's where DRM really starts to come out and done, isn't
[00:38:05.380 --> 00:38:11.700]   it, where you need to access a game via the PSN and all to authorize it to play it on the
[00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:15.100]   console that you've got because the PSN serves it down, you can't play it.
[00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:18.700]   Well, I think this is really the issue that we're going to get into.
[00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:22.180]   I mean, we're kind of in the growing pains of cloud computing where we saw the breakdown
[00:38:22.180 --> 00:38:28.500]   in Amazon, we saw the breakdown in where Sony, where, you know, that this is kind of
[00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:32.620]   the wake up calls that you need to make sure that you have a robust backup system that
[00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:33.620]   you have.
[00:38:33.620 --> 00:38:34.620]   And we're really separated.
[00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:38.500]   I think we've kind of taken something for granted and now we need to, you know, I think
[00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:41.340]   these are fortunately these haven't been real showstoppers.
[00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:42.340]   It could be a lot worse.
[00:38:42.340 --> 00:38:47.340]   And I mean, I think we were, I mean, sort of a bit critical of Sony for being not very
[00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:50.180]   talkative about the problems but you could argue it's saying about Amazon actually,
[00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:51.820]   that Amazon was remarkably uncommunicative.
[00:38:51.820 --> 00:38:52.820]   And Apple.
[00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:55.060]   Given the seriousness of what happened to them.
[00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:59.580]   I spoke to someone at Apple this week who was, you know, said basically they were slow
[00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:03.140]   on the update with all the location tracking stuff and Amazon as well.
[00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:08.220]   Doesn't this just speak to the larger trust issue as it relates to the cloud?
[00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:11.580]   Everyone's worried about this issue and they're saying, Oh, the cloud, can we really worry
[00:39:11.580 --> 00:39:12.580]   about that?
[00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:16.260]   And the contrarian approach is look, we rely on all these services all the time that aren't
[00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:17.260]   reliable, right?
[00:39:17.260 --> 00:39:19.820]   I mean, we go away for a subway on a regular basis.
[00:39:19.820 --> 00:39:20.820]   How often is that late?
[00:39:20.820 --> 00:39:24.660]   And I can't get there or, you know, you take public transportation, you take highways and
[00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:26.500]   you have to sit in traffic on a regular basis.
[00:39:26.500 --> 00:39:32.980]   So you have these outages and I think everyone jumps on this bandwagon that all this just
[00:39:32.980 --> 00:39:33.980]   speaks.
[00:39:33.980 --> 00:39:37.060]   I mean, I think there was like a thousand or 1500 articles all written about this idea
[00:39:37.060 --> 00:39:39.780]   of the cloud and it being a complete failure.
[00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:42.140]   And this is one of the reasons why we shouldn't rush to the cloud.
[00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:44.460]   I think that's really unfortunate because I don't think this is a failure.
[00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:45.460]   I think it's inevitable.
[00:39:45.460 --> 00:39:47.540]   I mean, I think that I think we're going to be, I mean, when you look at where we're
[00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:50.180]   going, I think this is, these are some speed bumps.
[00:39:50.180 --> 00:39:52.700]   I don't think that I think that people doing stuff on the cloud.
[00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:56.980]   And I was a real naysayer for a long time because I don't like a lot of having all my
[00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:57.980]   data up there.
[00:39:57.980 --> 00:39:58.980]   I don't like all that stuff.
[00:39:58.980 --> 00:40:03.300]   But now realize that half my life is connected to the cloud now.
[00:40:03.300 --> 00:40:07.340]   So I mean, I do think this is, you know, resistance is futile at this point.
[00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:08.780]   It is funny how it's all changed, right?
[00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:12.940]   I mean, you get a new MacBook Air, you know, get like the 11 inch MacBook Air or something
[00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:13.940]   in the setup process.
[00:40:13.940 --> 00:40:14.980]   You're like, Oh, wait, you know what?
[00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:17.980]   I don't really need to migrate anything here because everything goes through the cloud.
[00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:20.980]   And I just need to go and download the Dropbox app.
[00:40:20.980 --> 00:40:21.980]   And that's everything.
[00:40:21.980 --> 00:40:27.220]   I download caffeine when I get a new computer to keep my, you know, screen from going to
[00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:28.220]   sleep.
[00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:30.460]   I download caffeine now.
[00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:32.100]   I'm thrilled.
[00:40:32.100 --> 00:40:34.940]   No more churches star, right in Spain, right?
[00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:37.300]   Just hook it right up to a US report.
[00:40:37.300 --> 00:40:38.300]   And right down, right down.
[00:40:38.300 --> 00:40:39.820]   He's unplugged from the matrix.
[00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:42.180]   So we just plug them into a chair.
[00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:50.060]   And then you did see, you, you called this to our attention will a South parks reaction
[00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:53.340]   to the, yes, to the, what do we call this location gate?
[00:40:53.340 --> 00:40:55.060]   Is that we call it now?
[00:40:55.060 --> 00:40:56.860]   Are we really calling it location gate?
[00:40:56.860 --> 00:40:57.860]   Oh, come on.
[00:40:57.860 --> 00:40:59.860]   It's got to be something gate.
[00:40:59.860 --> 00:41:03.260]   There's going to be some kind of pun based on the fact that you could go through a gate
[00:41:03.260 --> 00:41:04.260]   because it's a location.
[00:41:04.260 --> 00:41:05.260]   I don't know.
[00:41:05.260 --> 00:41:06.260]   They've opened a location gate.
[00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:09.700]   It should be the location open gate or something.
[00:41:09.700 --> 00:41:10.980]   I think we've talked about this.
[00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:12.620]   We certainly talked about it on Mac break.
[00:41:12.620 --> 00:41:14.540]   We think we probably talked about it on Twitter last week.
[00:41:14.540 --> 00:41:18.340]   My sense of this is, well, the, you know, this is, I don't think Apple was attempting
[00:41:18.340 --> 00:41:24.020]   to spy on us or what do you guys think it looks like in their explanations.
[00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:27.740]   I mean, the issue is that when they say that they're not tracking you, what they're saying
[00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:32.100]   is that we all we're trying to figure out is where all the Wi-Fi spots are and where
[00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:33.580]   the cell towers are.
[00:41:33.580 --> 00:41:36.460]   We're not trying to figure out where you are at any moment, but we are trying to figure
[00:41:36.460 --> 00:41:40.140]   out where those are because what that helps is accelerate a cold start.
[00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:42.860]   So when you turn your computer, when you, when you come out of a plane or you come out
[00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:47.380]   of whatever and you, you have a hot start and a cold start with a GPS and the faster
[00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:52.940]   the GPS knows where it, where it is, the faster it will light up all of those connections.
[00:41:52.940 --> 00:41:55.380]   And so that, that's called the Almanac.
[00:41:55.380 --> 00:41:58.220]   It keeps an Almanac of a previous location.
[00:41:58.220 --> 00:42:01.500]   So you're saying that's all that was is the GPS Almanac?
[00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:05.660]   Well, it's not the GPS one because it's not using the, but it's cheating by using the
[00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:12.300]   basically, basically, but by using cell towers and Wi-Fi, it can, it can more readily figure
[00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:17.300]   out where it is for a hot start, you know, and so having that data in there, you know,
[00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:18.860]   and then of course it also helps Apple.
[00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:24.060]   I mean, when you look at, it helps Apple and Google figure out where they're going to
[00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:27.020]   do things like, you know, someone was talking about, you know, I was really surprised that
[00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:32.020]   my, my hometown in Montana is completely mapped out in Google.
[00:42:32.020 --> 00:42:35.700]   Like, you know, and there's like one stoplight and, and how does that happen?
[00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:37.860]   Why does Google, why does Google map it there?
[00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:41.140]   It's because they've seen that there's a lot of people that are using Google services
[00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:44.820]   in that area because they're getting those reports back and they go, Oh, well, we can,
[00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:48.380]   it's worth it to map out that area because there's enough people that would actually
[00:42:48.380 --> 00:42:49.380]   use it.
[00:42:49.380 --> 00:42:50.820]   Let me ask Clayton and Natalie, what do you guys feel?
[00:42:50.820 --> 00:42:54.620]   Do you feel like you both probably carry iPhones right Natalie, you carry an iPhone?
[00:42:54.620 --> 00:42:55.620]   Yeah.
[00:42:55.620 --> 00:43:01.260]   And you buy a phone that has a GPS inside of it and then all of a sudden you're so upset
[00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:04.900]   that, that a company would know when it's working.
[00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:08.580]   I, I don't, I think that this has kind of been blown out of proportion a little bit and
[00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:11.900]   that, you know, I think the mainstream media doesn't really understand it completely.
[00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:13.500]   So they're like, wait a minute.
[00:43:13.500 --> 00:43:15.940]   There was a lot of correcting going on this week.
[00:43:15.940 --> 00:43:16.940]   Trust me.
[00:43:16.940 --> 00:43:19.300]   You know, Apple, obviously the teas isn't different.
[00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:22.100]   Apple is cashing in on your location.
[00:43:22.100 --> 00:43:23.100]   Really?
[00:43:23.100 --> 00:43:24.100]   I'm sorry.
[00:43:24.100 --> 00:43:25.100]   How are they cashing in?
[00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:28.120]   Are they selling this now to third parties and they're trying to make money based on
[00:43:28.120 --> 00:43:31.980]   selling you tacos because they know that you're 34th and Vine at this moment?
[00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:36.700]   No, they're using it to obviously try to improve the devices and use this information, however
[00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:37.700]   they're going to use it.
[00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:40.100]   But I agree with, I agree with Natalie in this.
[00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:42.460]   The AT&T has this information.
[00:43:42.460 --> 00:43:43.460]   Right?
[00:43:43.460 --> 00:43:48.540]   And we knew that they could do this for a long time because of mobile means find my phone
[00:43:48.540 --> 00:43:52.500]   just because you don't pay for it doesn't mean that it doesn't work.
[00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:57.620]   So they always have had the ability to tell where your phone was by cell tower triangulation.
[00:43:57.620 --> 00:44:02.540]   Just the fact that it's cashed in iTunes is what's so offensive here and I'm not offended.
[00:44:02.540 --> 00:44:04.500]   I already knew that it could do this.
[00:44:04.500 --> 00:44:05.500]   All right.
[00:44:05.500 --> 00:44:11.260]   Let's see what the, let's see what the kids in South Park think about this whole thing.
[00:44:11.260 --> 00:44:14.740]   I'm going to push some buttons to make the magic happen here.
[00:44:14.740 --> 00:44:18.820]   So yeah, the, while you're pushing the buttons, the, I'm hoping that when Apple fixes this,
[00:44:18.820 --> 00:44:21.980]   they leave an option that says, you know, continue to cash or not cash.
[00:44:21.980 --> 00:44:27.300]   They default not cash, but I actually loved all the maps that I got, I got out of it.
[00:44:27.300 --> 00:44:30.660]   And I'd be a little bit bummed about your trading, your trading location information
[00:44:30.660 --> 00:44:32.580]   for convenience because you get some value out of this.
[00:44:32.580 --> 00:44:35.420]   I, I would find my iPhone free now.
[00:44:35.420 --> 00:44:37.020]   It used to be part of mobile me.
[00:44:37.020 --> 00:44:38.020]   No, it's free.
[00:44:38.020 --> 00:44:39.020]   It's free now.
[00:44:39.020 --> 00:44:40.020]   Okay.
[00:44:40.020 --> 00:44:41.500]   It's going to affect everybody gets it.
[00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:47.140]   So here's a, here's our friends in South Park explaining how all this works.
[00:44:47.140 --> 00:44:51.100]   You see, and then I can take all my homework on my iPad and swipe it over to my iPhone.
[00:44:51.100 --> 00:44:52.100]   Oh, yeah.
[00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:53.100]   Apple stuff's pretty neat.
[00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:54.100]   All right.
[00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:56.940]   I just don't want any big company tracking where I am at all times.
[00:44:56.940 --> 00:44:58.180]   Oh, that's just a rumor.
[00:44:58.180 --> 00:44:59.180]   They don't really track you.
[00:44:59.180 --> 00:45:00.180]   Here he is.
[00:45:00.180 --> 00:45:01.180]   Hello Kyle.
[00:45:01.180 --> 00:45:02.180]   We're from Apple.
[00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:03.180]   We're all ready for you now.
[00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:04.180]   What?
[00:45:04.180 --> 00:45:05.180]   Ready for what?
[00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:06.180]   To fulfill the agreement.
[00:45:06.180 --> 00:45:07.180]   Can we get a wait, please?
[00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:08.180]   83 pounds, sir.
[00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:09.180]   What?
[00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:10.180]   What agreement?
[00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:11.180]   83 pounds, good.
[00:45:11.180 --> 00:45:12.180]   Let's get the blood work.
[00:45:12.180 --> 00:45:14.260]   Hey, you can't do that.
[00:45:14.260 --> 00:45:16.220]   You agreed we could take all the blood we needed.
[00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:17.220]   What are you talking about?
[00:45:17.220 --> 00:45:20.820]   When you downloaded the last iTunes update, a window on your screen popped up and asked
[00:45:20.820 --> 00:45:23.260]   you if you agreed to our terms and conditions, you clicked agree.
[00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:24.260]   All right.
[00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:25.260]   Let's get them to the water tank.
[00:45:25.260 --> 00:45:26.260]   The water tank.
[00:45:26.260 --> 00:45:27.260]   I'm not going with you.
[00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:29.260]   You've agreed to all of this.
[00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:30.260]   Hey.
[00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:34.700]   You guys, you got to help me.
[00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:37.820]   These business casual g-men are trying to kidnap me.
[00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:38.820]   This business casual cheap.
[00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:39.820]   It's crazy, dude.
[00:45:39.820 --> 00:45:43.380]   There's things because I agreed to the latest terms and conditions on iTunes.
[00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:44.380]   Why?
[00:45:44.380 --> 00:45:45.940]   What did the terms and conditions for the last update say?
[00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:46.940]   I don't know.
[00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:47.940]   I didn't read them.
[00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:48.940]   You didn't read them?
[00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:53.060]   Who the hell reads that entire thing every time it pops up?
[00:45:53.060 --> 00:45:54.060]   I do.
[00:45:54.060 --> 00:45:55.060]   Me too.
[00:45:55.060 --> 00:45:59.860]   You're telling me that every time you guys download an update for iTunes, you read the
[00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:01.540]   entire terms and conditions.
[00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:02.540]   Of course.
[00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:05.940]   Well, how do you know if you agree to something if you don't read it?
[00:46:05.940 --> 00:46:07.900]   Well, I turned off all my Apple stuff.
[00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:12.940]   They can't locate you if you don't have your stuff on, right?
[00:46:12.940 --> 00:46:13.940]   There is.
[00:46:13.940 --> 00:46:14.940]   There is.
[00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:15.940]   You.
[00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:17.500]   So obviously they can.
[00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:20.380]   There's more to that.
[00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:25.740]   I just would like to say to Comedy Central, before you pull this video off of YouTube,
[00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:28.820]   I'm telling everybody that they should watch the entire episode.
[00:46:28.820 --> 00:46:29.820]   Okay?
[00:46:29.820 --> 00:46:30.820]   Thank you.
[00:46:30.820 --> 00:46:31.820]   There's a couple of things in that.
[00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:33.020]   The terms and conditions, right?
[00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:34.020]   15 pages.
[00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:35.020]   No.
[00:46:35.020 --> 00:46:36.820]   35 last count.
[00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:37.820]   35.
[00:46:37.820 --> 00:46:38.820]   35 pages.
[00:46:38.820 --> 00:46:40.740]   How often do you have to agree to those?
[00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:41.940]   Pretty much all the time.
[00:46:41.940 --> 00:46:44.060]   Every other time.
[00:46:44.060 --> 00:46:45.060]   Every update.
[00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:50.780]   But I think it's really interesting that, you know, mainstream culture quote has caught
[00:46:50.780 --> 00:46:55.140]   on to this fact, you know, things that previously would be really super nerdy, like the amount
[00:46:55.140 --> 00:46:58.140]   of times you had to agree to a new terms and conditions update.
[00:46:58.140 --> 00:47:00.220]   That's now something that's so mainstream.
[00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:02.220]   It's in, you know, a Comedy Central show.
[00:47:02.220 --> 00:47:09.780]   It's actually a measure of Apple's success in mainstreaming iTunes and all of this technology
[00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:12.580]   that everybody knows about it and is aware about it.
[00:47:12.580 --> 00:47:13.580]   And I think.
[00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:17.220]   But isn't this, this is why Facebook then changed their policy terms when it came to
[00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:20.700]   privacy because they realized no one's reading this, no one understands it.
[00:47:20.700 --> 00:47:23.660]   Now we're going to write this just in everyday vernacular.
[00:47:23.660 --> 00:47:28.060]   Which nobody still reads, but at least if you did, you'd understand it.
[00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:29.060]   Right.
[00:47:29.060 --> 00:47:33.220]   So, it's become very clear now and I think every company now realizes this is, we are
[00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:34.220]   aware of it.
[00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:35.860]   People are aware of it and it will be a story.
[00:47:35.860 --> 00:47:38.980]   Whether it's a legitimate story or not is irrelevant.
[00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:43.540]   It is important that companies tell you clearly and obviously that they're doing this.
[00:47:43.540 --> 00:47:44.540]   Apple didn't do that.
[00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:45.820]   They didn't handle it very well.
[00:47:45.820 --> 00:47:48.980]   If there's a failure here, it's a PR failure more than anything else.
[00:47:48.980 --> 00:47:53.580]   But going forward, you know, Apple, Google and everybody else, look, it should be obvious.
[00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:57.780]   It's obvious to us that if you've got a phone with a GPS that you're being tracked and a
[00:47:57.780 --> 00:48:01.660]   microphone and a camera, that this is the ultimate spy device.
[00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:06.860]   But I think it just behooves Apple and everybody else now to say, and they do this with other
[00:48:06.860 --> 00:48:08.940]   stuff where might is constantly.
[00:48:08.940 --> 00:48:09.940]   This is happening.
[00:48:09.940 --> 00:48:13.140]   It's a great conversation to have for people just for those, for people who weren't clear
[00:48:13.140 --> 00:48:14.140]   of it.
[00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:17.020]   I think a lot of us just look at it and shrug our shoulders because to us it's obvious
[00:48:17.020 --> 00:48:19.620]   that you would be picking that information up.
[00:48:19.620 --> 00:48:24.420]   But I think that for people who buy iPhones, you know, the general population, I don't
[00:48:24.420 --> 00:48:26.860]   think that they even consider the idea.
[00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:29.780]   So I think it is a great thing to get pressed so that people know about it.
[00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:31.100]   Do I think it's any big deal?
[00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:32.460]   I don't really think it's that big of a deal.
[00:48:32.460 --> 00:48:34.620]   But I do think it's important people to think about it.
[00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:38.700]   There's always people who will see an app that will ask for their location.
[00:48:38.700 --> 00:48:42.980]   Like, why does my baby ABC app need to know my location?
[00:48:42.980 --> 00:48:46.220]   You know, and you just kind of, there are people who will shrug and say, whatever.
[00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:49.300]   And then there are people who will go, oh my God, this is big brother.
[00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:50.300]   I can't handle it.
[00:48:50.300 --> 00:48:52.860]   And who gets the benefit of these location services?
[00:48:52.860 --> 00:48:53.860]   The people will shrug.
[00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:55.860]   Well, and the other thing you remember is that this will...
[00:48:55.860 --> 00:48:56.860]   That's what I think.
[00:48:56.860 --> 00:48:57.860]   Yeah.
[00:48:57.860 --> 00:48:58.860]   It's not going to be big brother.
[00:48:58.860 --> 00:49:00.500]   It's going to be lawyers that really take advantage of this.
[00:49:00.500 --> 00:49:03.980]   I mean, my father will tell you, my father's a lawyer, he'll tell you if there's a car
[00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:07.220]   accident, if he's got a client in the car accident, the very first thing he does is
[00:49:07.220 --> 00:49:08.220]   subpoena the phone records.
[00:49:08.220 --> 00:49:09.220]   Right.
[00:49:09.220 --> 00:49:12.140]   Because if you're on the phone when you're in the accident, well, he wins.
[00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:14.580]   You know, and it's just, you know, it's just like, you know, they'll settle.
[00:49:14.580 --> 00:49:17.500]   The insurance company won't even take it to court at that point.
[00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:18.500]   You know, they've lost the case.
[00:49:18.500 --> 00:49:21.460]   And so it doesn't matter whether you're in the front of the back or sideways.
[00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:23.220]   If you're in the phone, you're done.
[00:49:23.220 --> 00:49:24.220]   You know?
[00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:25.460]   And so that's the first thing he does.
[00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:29.060]   And what they're going to start doing is, of course, you know, subpoenaing, you know, GPS.
[00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:30.740]   Well, law enforcement's done in this all along.
[00:49:30.740 --> 00:49:33.260]   I mean, this is a freely available law enforcement.
[00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:37.340]   Hey, by the way, speaking of lawyers, both class action lawsuits against Google and
[00:49:37.340 --> 00:49:39.500]   Android over this.
[00:49:39.500 --> 00:49:44.300]   I mean, Google and Apple, Google, a $50 million lawsuit seeks to stop Google from selling
[00:49:44.300 --> 00:49:45.780]   phones with software.
[00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:47.740]   They can track a user's location.
[00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:52.780]   Now if they succeed in that, aren't we all going to be pissed off?
[00:49:52.780 --> 00:49:53.780]   Yes.
[00:49:53.780 --> 00:49:56.700]   Like this lawsuit, if they win, oh, we're all have feature phones.
[00:49:56.700 --> 00:49:58.700]   Thanks to these two ladies in Michigan.
[00:49:58.700 --> 00:49:59.700]   Thank you.
[00:49:59.700 --> 00:50:04.620]   Now, the only reason that there is a class action is because Google obviously did not
[00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:07.540]   include the terms and conditions that AT&T.
[00:50:07.540 --> 00:50:08.540]   Oh, yeah.
[00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:09.540]   Let's talk about that.
[00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:11.980]   Well, I would come back a massive supreme.
[00:50:11.980 --> 00:50:15.900]   This is so underreported that I bet you most of the people listening right now have no idea
[00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:16.900]   what you're talking about.
[00:50:16.900 --> 00:50:21.140]   This may be the single most important story of the week, a Supreme Court decision that
[00:50:21.140 --> 00:50:23.260]   changes everything.
[00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:25.860]   And I don't know why it didn't get more attention.
[00:50:25.860 --> 00:50:28.740]   Certainly should have gotten more attention than location complicated.
[00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:29.740]   Too complicated.
[00:50:29.740 --> 00:50:30.740]   Yeah.
[00:50:30.740 --> 00:50:32.580]   Takes too much brain power.
[00:50:32.580 --> 00:50:33.740]   But not for our audience.
[00:50:33.740 --> 00:50:35.220]   They're brilliant.
[00:50:35.220 --> 00:50:40.860]   That's why I know that when I say, why don't you go to go to my PC.com right now and sign

[00:50:42.580 --> 00:50:46.380]   They're going to go right now to go to my PC.com.

[00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:52.140]   There's now I have you put it on your iPad yet?
[00:50:52.140 --> 00:50:53.140]   It's on the iPad.
[00:50:53.140 --> 00:50:54.140]   It's on my iPad yet.
[00:50:54.140 --> 00:50:55.140]   Yeah, it's really good.
[00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:56.140]   I've got an iPad on my own.
[00:50:56.140 --> 00:50:57.140]   Get it on the app store.
[00:50:57.140 --> 00:51:01.620]   So what happens is you put go to my PC on your Mac or your PC and then you leave the
[00:51:01.620 --> 00:51:03.100]   office and you can go anywhere.
[00:51:03.100 --> 00:51:07.900]   You take your iPad with you and it's so weird to see a Windows PC on an iPad by the way.
[00:51:07.900 --> 00:51:09.460]   It's a little strange, but it works great.
[00:51:09.460 --> 00:51:10.460]   It's very fast.
[00:51:10.460 --> 00:51:17.140]   These guys at Citrix know how to really get performance out of this even out of slower,
[00:51:17.140 --> 00:51:18.180]   more latent networks.
[00:51:18.180 --> 00:51:19.180]   They're experts.
[00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:20.940]   They created remote access.
[00:51:20.940 --> 00:51:23.300]   In fact, that's what's licensed to Microsoft.
[00:51:23.300 --> 00:51:28.740]   If you work in enterprise, you know about the Citrix server, this is the best stuff.
[00:51:28.740 --> 00:51:31.580]   And I like it because go to my PC for the iPad gives you the best of both worlds.
[00:51:31.580 --> 00:51:33.300]   It's very thin, light device.
[00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:35.700]   And now you're running your computer, Windows PC.
[00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:40.100]   You can run any program, send and receive email, access any network resource, even email
[00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:42.420]   yourself data into your iPad.
[00:51:42.420 --> 00:51:44.180]   So you got it sets up in minutes.
[00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:45.820]   No IT help is required.
[00:51:45.820 --> 00:51:47.500]   The iPad app is free.
[00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:49.860]   And for the next 30 days, so is go to my PC.
[00:51:49.860 --> 00:51:51.020]   Give it a try.
[00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:55.700]   Go to my PC.com, click the try it free button and use the offer code twits.
[00:51:55.700 --> 00:51:58.660]   See, you're smart and I knew you would do that.
[00:51:58.660 --> 00:51:59.940]   So Alex, fill us in.
[00:51:59.940 --> 00:52:02.780]   What is this Supreme Court decision?
[00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:07.020]   So this is, you know, there was class action lawsuit against AT&T and the, you know, came
[00:52:07.020 --> 00:52:08.900]   got to the Supreme Court.
[00:52:08.900 --> 00:52:13.300]   And basically AT&T's argument is we have, it's in our terms of agreement.
[00:52:13.300 --> 00:52:15.140]   You didn't read the terms of agreement.
[00:52:15.140 --> 00:52:16.140]   Yes.
[00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:17.940]   How do you agree to something if you don't read it?
[00:52:17.940 --> 00:52:18.940]   Exactly.
[00:52:18.940 --> 00:52:22.420]   They said that basically we said you can't sue us as a class action.
[00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:25.260]   You can't, you know, like that, that you agree not to do that.
[00:52:25.260 --> 00:52:28.100]   And the Supreme Court upheld that, that ruling.
[00:52:28.100 --> 00:52:32.620]   So that basically what this means and what this means effectively, because this breaks,
[00:52:32.620 --> 00:52:37.140]   this is against the law, this was against the law in 20 states, you know, to put that
[00:52:37.140 --> 00:52:41.100]   in, into the terms of agreement, which now the theoretically overturned by the Supreme
[00:52:41.100 --> 00:52:42.100]   Court.
[00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:46.220]   But what the circuit said no to AT&T, that's why they went to the Supreme Court and got
[00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:47.900]   a very favorable ruling.
[00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:54.860]   So this is, and what will effectively happen is every ULA that you get in the next, within
[00:52:54.860 --> 00:52:56.740]   the next year, most likely will have this closet.
[00:52:56.740 --> 00:52:58.620]   It's the end, is it the end of class action lawsuits?
[00:52:58.620 --> 00:53:02.820]   Now I'm not necessarily a fan of class action lawsuits, but oftentimes the damages are so
[00:53:02.820 --> 00:53:05.020]   small that you're not going to sue.
[00:53:05.020 --> 00:53:09.460]   You can't, the only way you can correct it, something, you know, it's an early termination
[00:53:09.460 --> 00:53:10.460]   fee.
[00:53:10.460 --> 00:53:14.380]   Are you going to spend half a million dollars pursuing AT&T over an early termination fee
[00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:15.380]   of 150 bucks?
[00:53:15.380 --> 00:53:16.380]   You're not.
[00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:21.460]   On the other hand, the purpose of a class suit is that you can get AT&T to change your behavior
[00:53:21.460 --> 00:53:27.900]   by having to pay a class, and, you know, $150 each, that's, now you can get some decent
[00:53:27.900 --> 00:53:29.300]   money out of that.
[00:53:29.300 --> 00:53:32.780]   Their contingency fees are higher, so you can get a lawyer to represent you.
[00:53:32.780 --> 00:53:35.540]   Contingency fee on $150 ain't so good.
[00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:38.860]   I think these class action lawsuits, I know, I know we don't want a lot of litigation, but
[00:53:38.860 --> 00:53:42.580]   I think this is the only way to, to take care of some of these consumer issues.
[00:53:42.580 --> 00:53:45.980]   And I think that one of the reasons people have been a little blasey about it is because
[00:53:45.980 --> 00:53:49.580]   it has, it is a, there have been so many frivolous class action lawsuits.
[00:53:49.580 --> 00:53:50.580]   I understand that.
[00:53:50.580 --> 00:53:53.860]   And so I think that what's happened is that, that so many people using it when they shouldn't,
[00:53:53.860 --> 00:53:59.700]   and admittedly law firms who, their businesses, you know, get a class action together, settle,
[00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:04.300]   and remember, some of these, these law firms are taking anywhere from 20 to 40 percent of
[00:54:04.300 --> 00:54:05.300]   the take.
[00:54:05.300 --> 00:54:09.180]   So, you know, you have a hundred million dollar class action that gets settled out, and they're
[00:54:09.180 --> 00:54:12.340]   taking 20 to 40 million dollars off the top of that.
[00:54:12.340 --> 00:54:16.940]   And so those are the, you know, so that these law firms that have made it a business and
[00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:21.220]   gotten to this, into this mess, you know, is, I think why a lot of people just kind of
[00:54:21.220 --> 00:54:25.020]   roll their eyes like, well, it's probably better than to not have so many, but it is
[00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:32.420]   very, very, it's very, very important to be able to have class actions as a very important
[00:54:32.420 --> 00:54:37.580]   tool when things are happening that are beyond the reach of criminal activity, but are,
[00:54:37.580 --> 00:54:39.580]   you know, wrong.
[00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:44.180]   And allowing people to make that decision is very, very, very important, and this is a
[00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:45.180]   big deal.
[00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:46.180]   It's very complicated.
[00:54:46.180 --> 00:54:48.380]   It would have to be fixed now in Congress.
[00:54:48.380 --> 00:54:49.380]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:54:49.380 --> 00:54:50.980]   And all of these, think about it.
[00:54:50.980 --> 00:54:52.820]   And this, that's a certain precedent, right?
[00:54:52.820 --> 00:54:57.820]   So why wouldn't every company then take this tactic immediately and start to print as tiny
[00:54:57.820 --> 00:55:01.820]   apprentice possible so that, you know, I would need a, I would need a penguin style
[00:55:01.820 --> 00:55:27.340]   monocle to start studying all the fine print and documents.
[00:55:27.340 --> 00:55:32.340]   And I think that's a very, very difficult.
[00:55:32.340 --> 00:55:39.900]   On Thursday, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals ruled that an employee doesn't have to actually
[00:55:39.900 --> 00:55:45.340]   hack anything to be prosecuted for hacking.
[00:55:45.340 --> 00:55:53.580]   So essentially, the judge wrote, and the dissent agreed that an employer can write a
[00:55:53.580 --> 00:56:00.100]   policy, if you exceed authorized access, you can be prosecuted under federal anti-hacking
[00:56:00.100 --> 00:56:02.020]   laws.
[00:56:02.020 --> 00:56:10.100]   Any person, I think the judges in the minority, in the majority thought that this really means
[00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:13.860]   that if you're doing something fraudulent, you can get prosecuted.
[00:56:13.860 --> 00:56:15.500]   They even use the word fraudulent.
[00:56:15.500 --> 00:56:21.940]   But the minority decision was very clear that in fact you don't have to be committing
[00:56:21.940 --> 00:56:27.020]   fraud, just breaking the policies of your company.
[00:56:27.020 --> 00:56:32.700]   So get ready for some, all sorts of criminal prosecutions for people, you know, surfing
[00:56:32.700 --> 00:56:37.780]   to eBay against company policies and being accused of hacking.
[00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:41.100]   Or even maybe being on someone else's account.
[00:56:41.100 --> 00:56:47.500]   Like I'm just thinking at CNET, we always left ourselves logged into, you know, well,
[00:56:47.500 --> 00:56:51.580]   our CBS mail on a podcast computer or something like that.
[00:56:51.580 --> 00:56:53.980]   And you see that you're not in your own account.
[00:56:53.980 --> 00:56:58.620]   This that also opens you up to being fraudulent, even if you didn't really mean it.
[00:56:58.620 --> 00:57:01.340]   You just didn't realize it wasn't you that's logged in.
[00:57:01.340 --> 00:57:03.620]   Yeah, I'd love, I'm sure we'll discuss this.
[00:57:03.620 --> 00:57:07.380]   Maybe we already have on this week in law where we have actual lawyers.
[00:57:07.380 --> 00:57:09.940]   But this is kind of a scary precedent.
[00:57:09.940 --> 00:57:15.860]   No hacking is required to be prosecuted as a hacker.
[00:57:15.860 --> 00:57:20.820]   We also got quarterly results from Apple and Microsoft this week.
[00:57:20.820 --> 00:57:26.980]   And for the first time in history, Microsoft, Apple was more profitable than Microsoft.
[00:57:26.980 --> 00:57:30.620]   And more it Apple grossed and netted more.
[00:57:30.620 --> 00:57:32.140]   Yeah, than Microsoft.
[00:57:32.140 --> 00:57:35.860]   Yeah, we would have never thought that I mean like 15 years ago, it was.
[00:57:35.860 --> 00:57:39.060]   Well, it's interesting because Apple, you'd expect Apple to gross, you know, have more
[00:57:39.060 --> 00:57:41.540]   revenue because they're selling expensive hardware, right?
[00:57:41.540 --> 00:57:45.300]   But their margins, you would think are so small, so much smaller than something.
[00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:47.380]   That's the margin on a copy of Windows.
[00:57:47.380 --> 00:57:48.380]   Right.
[00:57:48.380 --> 00:57:50.980]   I mean, once they've done all the R&D, they can sell you, you know, a trillion of them
[00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:54.260]   at the same, you know, with full 100% profit.
[00:57:54.260 --> 00:57:59.820]   But in this case, Apple's hardware is so profitable and they sell so much of it.
[00:57:59.820 --> 00:58:01.780]   They actually made more money.
[00:58:01.780 --> 00:58:06.740]   Still, it's still less profitable as a for as a percentage than Microsoft, but they just
[00:58:06.740 --> 00:58:07.740]   made a lot of money.
[00:58:07.740 --> 00:58:08.900]   They made 50% more money.
[00:58:08.900 --> 00:58:09.900]   I think.
[00:58:09.900 --> 00:58:10.900]   I'll tell you the dollars.
[00:58:10.900 --> 00:58:11.900]   Right.
[00:58:11.900 --> 00:58:15.100]   They just made a little bit more margin, but they made I think 50% more revenue revenue.
[00:58:15.100 --> 00:58:19.900]   So it's still a smaller margin, but they're just out grossing Microsoft.
[00:58:19.900 --> 00:58:23.740]   Does that seem, Will Harris, like a sudden change in the way of the world?
[00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:32.580]   Undoubtedly, it makes Apple, you know, notionally the most successful computing company pretty
[00:58:32.580 --> 00:58:34.580]   much on the face of the planet, doesn't it?
[00:58:34.580 --> 00:58:36.340]   They make more money than Google.
[00:58:36.340 --> 00:58:38.180]   They make more money than Michael.
[00:58:38.180 --> 00:58:39.180]   Yeah.
[00:58:39.180 --> 00:58:40.180]   Which is amazing.
[00:58:40.180 --> 00:58:47.300]   Cash in their bank account to give every single man, woman and child in the United Kingdom
[00:58:47.300 --> 00:58:48.300]   a thousand dollars.
[00:58:48.300 --> 00:58:50.820]   I think they should do three more.
[00:58:50.820 --> 00:58:52.700]   Will Harris, three more.
[00:58:52.700 --> 00:58:53.980]   Just send them all an iPad.
[00:58:53.980 --> 00:58:56.860]   You know, Will's feeling cocky because he got a four day weekend because of the royal
[00:58:56.860 --> 00:58:57.860]   wedding.
[00:58:57.860 --> 00:59:01.500]   Now, does you know, just because he didn't cocky because he got his new toy, you got
[00:59:01.500 --> 00:59:02.500]   a white one.
[00:59:02.500 --> 00:59:03.660]   Look at that.
[00:59:03.660 --> 00:59:05.620]   Is it is it thicker than the black one?
[00:59:05.620 --> 00:59:09.620]   Oh, by like a quarter of a millimeter, maybe.
[00:59:09.620 --> 00:59:11.940]   Oh, it's about time.
[00:59:11.940 --> 00:59:15.140]   It's about time that it's thicker about time that it's white.
[00:59:15.140 --> 00:59:24.580]   I'm going to refrain from making it worse.
[00:59:24.580 --> 00:59:27.940]   You really, there's a wide is a big, I just, okay.
[00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:28.940]   Okay.
[00:59:28.940 --> 00:59:29.940]   You're smart.
[00:59:29.940 --> 00:59:31.860]   Clayton, you're a very smart man.
[00:59:31.860 --> 00:59:34.740]   You're just thinking he's two words.
[00:59:34.740 --> 00:59:36.980]   One Williams, one Williams, one one.
[00:59:36.980 --> 00:59:40.980]   Just keeps, keeps, keeps, keeps, keeps, keeps, keeps, keeps, keeps, keeps, keeps, keeps
[00:59:40.980 --> 00:59:41.980]   away from my head and then slap me in the back.
[00:59:41.980 --> 00:59:42.980]   Yeah, it's fair.
[00:59:42.980 --> 00:59:43.980]   But it is, right.
[00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:47.220]   And I heard, I read some of the cases to fit, right?
[00:59:47.220 --> 00:59:51.140]   The, the, yeah, some of the original cases, it won't fit or it fits too snugly and you
[00:59:51.140 --> 00:59:54.740]   need to get, you need to get some of the cases that at least have like a bit of a bendy,
[00:59:54.740 --> 00:59:57.940]   a bendiness quality to them so you can slide it in there because it's a little too thick
[00:59:57.940 --> 00:59:58.940]   or at least on the front.
[00:59:58.940 --> 01:00:03.820]   So if it sits up there, it's a little, it's a little thicker on the top on the plastic part.
[01:00:03.820 --> 01:00:06.900]   So we can now say this could be the tagline, the new iPhone.
[01:00:06.900 --> 01:00:09.500]   It's white, it's thicker and it won't fit.
[01:00:09.500 --> 01:00:16.420]   We all just, yeah, we're all just kind of like, come on, I know you want to say that's
[01:00:16.420 --> 01:00:17.420]   what she said.
[01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:19.020]   I know you want to say that's what she said.
[01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:20.020]   That's what she said.
[01:00:20.020 --> 01:00:23.020]   I'm just torturing you.
[01:00:23.020 --> 01:00:27.940]   So Microsoft, sorry, I'm so sorry, Natalie.
[01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:29.580]   You're, you're a mother.
[01:00:29.580 --> 01:00:30.780]   I shouldn't treat you like that.
[01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:31.780]   I am someone's mother.
[01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:32.780]   She's someone's mother.
[01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:37.380]   I expect respect and I'm also the princess of ice or whatever.
[01:00:37.380 --> 01:00:39.780]   Ah, yes, you will soon be.
[01:00:39.780 --> 01:00:41.060]   We now know what you're getting for Mother's Day.
[01:00:41.060 --> 01:00:43.180]   I hope you weren't listening.
[01:00:43.180 --> 01:00:47.180]   So don't get all excited Apple fans though, just because Apple made more money doesn't
[01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:51.100]   mean it's commanding a bigger percentage.
[01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:57.820]   According to a Gartner group, Microsoft has 79% of worldwide OS revenue.
[01:00:57.820 --> 01:00:59.980]   I think that that's according to revenue, right?
[01:00:59.980 --> 01:01:00.980]   Not actual install.
[01:01:00.980 --> 01:01:01.980]   Yeah.
[01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:04.180]   It's actually after Red Hat on that one.
[01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:08.500]   But I guess because they don't sell, I mean, everybody who gets a Mac has an operating system.
[01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:10.820]   They don't sell the operating system.
[01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:11.820]   Right.
[01:01:11.820 --> 01:01:19.020]   Apple's market share, global market share is 1.7% up from 1.6%.
[01:01:19.020 --> 01:01:21.420]   According to revenue.
[01:01:21.420 --> 01:01:22.420]   According to revenue.
[01:01:22.420 --> 01:01:24.460]   What do you think about all this cash?
[01:01:24.460 --> 01:01:26.980]   You know, every few months you hear these pieces come out.
[01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:29.460]   God, I just love to have like, what is it?
[01:01:29.460 --> 01:01:30.460]   $32 billion?
[01:01:30.460 --> 01:01:31.460]   66, no, I think.
[01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:32.460]   66.
[01:01:32.460 --> 01:01:33.460]   66.
[01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:35.740]   What would you sit on this cash, right?
[01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:40.340]   And every few months you have some market analysts who say, you know, why isn't Apple
[01:01:40.340 --> 01:01:43.860]   buying up companies?
[01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:44.860]   Why?
[01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:47.180]   I mean, they bought Lala, right?
[01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:48.180]   That was the last thing they bought.
[01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:49.180]   Yeah, but that was cheap.
[01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:52.540]   Well, the bottom line is it gives them the option that if they need to buy something
[01:01:52.540 --> 01:01:56.980]   to solve some issue, I mean, someone talked about, you know, Comcast making money.
[01:01:56.980 --> 01:02:00.100]   They could buy, you know, Netflix, for instance.
[01:02:00.100 --> 01:02:01.620]   They just write a check for Netflix.
[01:02:01.620 --> 01:02:02.860]   It wouldn't even show up on that.
[01:02:02.860 --> 01:02:06.140]   It wouldn't even show up on the main page of their, you know, of their expenditures.
[01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:07.140]   You know, it's-
[01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:10.420]   I think one of the things they like doing, and one of the things I think, you know, the
[01:02:10.420 --> 01:02:16.580]   operations guy are quite hot on doing, is because they have this massive pile of cash,
[01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:22.260]   they can make really, really big advanced orders for all the actual opponents of hardware
[01:02:22.260 --> 01:02:24.220]   that they manufacture in China.
[01:02:24.220 --> 01:02:25.220]   Yeah.
[01:02:25.220 --> 01:02:27.860]   And that means they can guarantee cheaper prices.
[01:02:27.860 --> 01:02:31.420]   So when something like the, you know, the Japan earthquake happens, they've already
[01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:36.300]   got all their pricing and all their hardware, you know, locked up for the next six months.
[01:02:36.300 --> 01:02:38.820]   So something like that just doesn't affect them at all.
[01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:44.220]   So we saw, you know, I think in Apple's results that the Japan earthquake kind of had no effect
[01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:45.220]   on their net margin.
[01:02:45.220 --> 01:02:48.940]   And that's because they've got so much cash to be able to guarantee all these orders,
[01:02:48.940 --> 01:02:52.260]   you know, six or 12 months in advance to make sure they get the pricing that they want.
[01:02:52.260 --> 01:02:57.500]   And that's why Apple is able to, you know, really make such great margins on all these
[01:02:57.500 --> 01:02:58.500]   products.
[01:02:58.500 --> 01:03:03.500]   Or as Reverb Mike in our chat room says, maybe Apple's saving up to buy America.
[01:03:03.500 --> 01:03:10.620]   Well, but I think that they could, at some point in time, it does give them room to be
[01:03:10.620 --> 01:03:12.780]   very aggressive about certain things.
[01:03:12.780 --> 01:03:15.940]   If they need to push a technology, if they need to push something down the path, or they
[01:03:15.940 --> 01:03:18.500]   need to purchase something much larger, maybe they have ideas about that.
[01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:22.500]   But it also does mean that they can, you know, they can do that without worrying about running
[01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:23.500]   out of cash.
[01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:26.380]   And because they're a hardware manufacturer, I mean, you see that, you know, these expenditures
[01:03:26.380 --> 01:03:29.460]   that they're making over the next year, I think the next quarter, I think, was like 11
[01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:30.460]   billion.
[01:03:30.460 --> 01:03:34.060]   And so they, you know, if they're going to continue to grow, you know, they have to be
[01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:35.060]   able to buy.
[01:03:35.060 --> 01:03:39.540]   They have to have a massive amount of cash on hand, much more than a software company like
[01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:42.460]   Microsoft because they're because of their dealing with all these issues.
[01:03:42.460 --> 01:03:43.460]   Right.
[01:03:43.460 --> 01:03:46.700]   And I'm surprised Clayton hasn't said this yet, but you can tell they put a lot more money
[01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:49.380]   in research and development when it comes to a new product.
[01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:50.380]   They don't skimp.
[01:03:50.380 --> 01:03:52.220]   They don't cut corners.
[01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:55.020]   And they will go back to the drawing board if it doesn't come out.
[01:03:55.020 --> 01:03:56.020]   Yeah.
[01:03:56.020 --> 01:04:00.940]   Except as a, except as a proportion of their, of their revenue, R&D, Apple is much, much
[01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:02.460]   lower than Microsoft's.
[01:04:02.460 --> 01:04:03.460]   Two percent.
[01:04:03.460 --> 01:04:07.140]   Microsoft spends a really, really large portion of its, of its income on R&D.
[01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:08.140]   Apple's.
[01:04:08.140 --> 01:04:14.140]   But Microsoft is R&D-ing weird things that, you know, they just go on R&D whatever.
[01:04:14.140 --> 01:04:15.140]   Like how can we.
[01:04:15.140 --> 01:04:16.340]   >> And we love them for it.
[01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:17.860]   >> And they have med sheets or whatever.
[01:04:17.860 --> 01:04:19.360]   >> No, that's funny because the most.
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:20.980]   >> That's the most- >> That's the automating system
[01:04:20.980 --> 01:04:24.180]   and a bed sheet and Apple only does the thing that they know,
[01:04:24.180 --> 01:04:24.780]   and it really puts it up.
[01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:26.960]   >> No, it's a good point, what's the last big R&D thing
[01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:28.860]   to come out of Microsoft that we know of?
[01:04:28.860 --> 01:04:30.860]   >> Well I would say, I would say connect,
[01:04:30.860 --> 01:04:32.380]   but they didn't invent that.
[01:04:32.380 --> 01:04:33.880]   They went out (mumbles)
[01:04:33.880 --> 01:04:34.600]   Right?
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:36.300]   >> Wasn't that photo made with art
[01:04:36.300 --> 01:04:37.800]   >> With auto synth and surface,
[01:04:37.800 --> 01:04:40.900]   let's not forget the fabulous big-ass table.
[01:04:40.900 --> 01:04:42.180]   >> Like just on the generation, yeah.
[01:04:42.180 --> 01:04:43.660]   >> Yeah and M me, in photos Anything I have to say
[01:04:43.660 --> 01:04:46.940]   is my favorite app on my iPhone at the moment.
[01:04:46.940 --> 01:04:48.380]   >> Although there are people who will say
[01:04:48.380 --> 01:04:53.180]   that surface was also, I guess, repurposing of other ideas
[01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:55.220]   that weren't originally Microsoft's either.
[01:04:55.220 --> 01:04:55.980]   >> That's true.
[01:04:55.980 --> 01:04:57.780]   >> I guess maybe Zoom.
[01:04:57.780 --> 01:05:01.460]   >> That worked out pretty well for them.
[01:05:01.460 --> 01:05:04.580]   >> Ah, you're just, that's just cold.
[01:05:04.580 --> 01:05:08.180]   You must be an Apple fanboy to even say the C word.
[01:05:08.180 --> 01:05:10.780]   Or as you people say the Z word.
[01:05:11.820 --> 01:05:14.060]   Actually, did you see the loss?
[01:05:14.060 --> 01:05:17.460]   Among other things, if you dig through the Microsoft filing,
[01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:20.740]   the quarterly results, their biggest loss
[01:05:20.740 --> 01:05:23.120]   was over $200 million online.
[01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:28.060]   This was the big money losing division was Bing!
[01:05:28.060 --> 01:05:31.140]   Or I guess they wouldn't have argued
[01:05:31.140 --> 01:05:33.980]   that that's the big investment deficit spending.
[01:05:33.980 --> 01:05:37.060]   >> Right, because they spent so much,
[01:05:37.060 --> 01:05:39.060]   have you seen the big, I can't imagine it's backend
[01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:41.540]   infrastructure, but so much on getting this thing up
[01:05:41.540 --> 01:05:43.340]   and running in the partnerships that they spend.
[01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:45.780]   They spent money hand over fist, plus they're doing all kinds
[01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:48.700]   of events like South by Southwest, they're running people
[01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:50.660]   in buses, do you remember at CES?
[01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:53.500]   They're having like the Bing buses you could take all around
[01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:54.540]   Las Vegas.
[01:05:54.540 --> 01:05:57.540]   They spend money hand over fist in these large concerts
[01:05:57.540 --> 01:05:59.220]   where they're trying to be hip and cool,
[01:05:59.220 --> 01:06:01.020]   where people are gonna show up to a concert
[01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:02.480]   that's put on by Bing.
[01:06:02.480 --> 01:06:07.580]   Or they were rolling off, remember the Kin?
[01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:08.860]   Remember they rolled out the whole Kin?
[01:06:08.860 --> 01:06:09.940]   >> Oh, the Kin, oh yeah.
[01:06:09.940 --> 01:06:12.860]   >> And they did that whole big concert series for the Kin,
[01:06:12.860 --> 01:06:15.420]   like they wanted hip young kids to come
[01:06:15.420 --> 01:06:19.020]   and play with their Kin phones at a Microsoft concert series
[01:06:19.020 --> 01:06:20.340]   to then-- >> Two people showed up.
[01:06:20.340 --> 01:06:22.820]   >> Right, so they spent like five million dollars
[01:06:22.820 --> 01:06:24.620]   on little things like that on a regular basis.
[01:06:24.620 --> 01:06:27.100]   I can't imagine that's, I've imagined that's probably
[01:06:27.100 --> 01:06:28.220]   what they did with Bing.
[01:06:28.220 --> 01:06:29.060]   >> Have you seen the maps on--
[01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:33.540]   >> But they did gain percentage in search though.
[01:06:33.540 --> 01:06:35.780]   They're gaining percentage over Yahoo!
[01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:37.340]   >> They're buying percentage.
[01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:39.940]   They're buying percentage. >> Right, right, right.
[01:06:39.940 --> 01:06:42.660]   So what's up with the maps Alex?
[01:06:42.660 --> 01:06:44.700]   >> Well, they're spending a lot more money on maps
[01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:46.100]   so I can tell you that than Google was.
[01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:48.700]   If you go to San Francisco and you compare the Google maps
[01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:51.300]   and the Bing maps, so Google is going around with a car
[01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:52.140]   and that's cute.
[01:06:52.140 --> 01:06:54.180]   They got little cameras and stuff like that.
[01:06:54.180 --> 01:06:55.420]   I saw one go by. >> And transport.
[01:06:55.420 --> 01:06:57.180]   >> And I was trying to think of something to do.
[01:06:57.180 --> 01:06:58.860]   I saw a Google car and I wanted to,
[01:06:58.860 --> 01:07:01.020]   like it was coming by me and I felt like this is my moment
[01:07:01.020 --> 01:07:02.620]   and I couldn't-- >> This is my moment to moon it.
[01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:03.780]   >> I know, yeah, it was something,
[01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:05.540]   it was like something but I couldn't do anything.
[01:07:05.540 --> 01:07:07.380]   But the Bing maps-- >> He froze.
[01:07:07.380 --> 01:07:08.220]   >> He froze.
[01:07:08.220 --> 01:07:10.220]   >> Oh man, the opportunity lost.
[01:07:10.220 --> 01:07:12.780]   >> They're using LIDAR for the end.
[01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:14.660]   >> That's that thing that spins around.
[01:07:14.660 --> 01:07:16.540]   >> If you actually move through the maps,
[01:07:16.540 --> 01:07:18.180]   you're realizing that there's 3D models.
[01:07:18.180 --> 01:07:21.060]   It's not just like they're not just planes,
[01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:23.020]   they can actually move in a lot more.
[01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:25.540]   It's much higher resolution than what Google's doing.
[01:07:25.540 --> 01:07:28.260]   And so this is just another area where they're dumping
[01:07:28.260 --> 01:07:29.700]   an enormous amount of money into things
[01:07:29.700 --> 01:07:31.900]   that they're upping the level of competition,
[01:07:31.900 --> 01:07:32.740]   which I think is good in the Midwest.
[01:07:32.740 --> 01:07:35.220]   >> They call it street side instead of street view.
[01:07:35.220 --> 01:07:36.060]   >> Oh dear.
[01:07:36.060 --> 01:07:37.060]   >> Is it really?
[01:07:37.060 --> 01:07:38.340]   >> No.
[01:07:38.340 --> 01:07:39.500]   >> You're not joking. >> It's just calm.
[01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:40.660]   >> You're gonna check it out.
[01:07:40.660 --> 01:07:42.140]   >> I mean, although people have been
[01:07:42.140 --> 01:07:44.500]   quite down on the Microsoft online figures,
[01:07:44.500 --> 01:07:46.220]   I think there are a couple of interesting things.
[01:07:46.220 --> 01:07:48.820]   Number one, it wasn't so long ago
[01:07:48.820 --> 01:07:52.180]   that everybody was really down on the hardware
[01:07:52.180 --> 01:07:54.780]   and of Microsoft and that it was their games division
[01:07:54.780 --> 01:07:56.980]   that was losing hundreds of millions a quarter.
[01:07:56.980 --> 01:08:00.380]   And now their games division is making them a ton of money.
[01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:03.540]   They put that investment in and then they're reaping it back.
[01:08:03.540 --> 01:08:05.500]   But I don't think it's gonna be too long actually
[01:08:05.500 --> 01:08:07.340]   before the games division starts to get into
[01:08:07.340 --> 01:08:09.980]   sort of net profit over the sort of five or 10 years
[01:08:09.980 --> 01:08:11.340]   they've been operating it.
[01:08:11.340 --> 01:08:12.740]   I think they're hoping the same will happen
[01:08:12.740 --> 01:08:13.860]   for the internet division.
[01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:15.740]   If you look at the revenues for the internet division,
[01:08:15.740 --> 01:08:17.500]   they're actually up year on year.
[01:08:17.500 --> 01:08:20.980]   So it is, although they're losing money,
[01:08:20.980 --> 01:08:23.780]   it is growing in the way that they want it to.
[01:08:23.780 --> 01:08:25.700]   >> You wanna take a guess at how much money
[01:08:25.700 --> 01:08:26.700]   they've lost online?
[01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:30.220]   >> In total.
[01:08:30.220 --> 01:08:31.580]   >> Total.
[01:08:31.580 --> 01:08:33.860]   >> I'll show you the graph.
[01:08:33.860 --> 01:08:34.700]   >> A bill for you.
[01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:37.780]   >> Before you say that, let me show you the graph.
[01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:42.780]   This is going back to 2005, $3 billion.
[01:08:42.780 --> 01:08:44.740]   >> Ouch.
[01:08:44.740 --> 01:08:46.340]   >> And it's not getting better.
[01:08:46.340 --> 01:08:51.700]   >> But if you look back, I mean, they were making money
[01:08:51.700 --> 01:08:54.820]   in the first couple of years, just looking at that graph.
[01:08:54.820 --> 01:08:55.660]   >> It was like two years.
[01:08:55.660 --> 01:08:57.180]   >> Wait a minute, like making money from online.
[01:08:57.180 --> 01:08:58.020]   What were they doing?
[01:08:58.020 --> 01:08:59.660]   >> I showed last year's graph.
[01:08:59.660 --> 01:09:00.740]   (laughs)
[01:09:00.740 --> 01:09:02.100]   Maybe that was Hotmail.
[01:09:02.100 --> 01:09:04.500]   >> That was last year's graph.
[01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:06.660]   It's even worse with Bing.
[01:09:06.660 --> 01:09:08.340]   Oh dear.
[01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:09.820]   That was from 2010.
[01:09:09.820 --> 01:09:11.020]   So it's been this way for a while.
[01:09:11.020 --> 01:09:13.260]   They've lost a huge amount of money.
[01:09:13.260 --> 01:09:15.260]   >> But they can afford to, right?
[01:09:15.260 --> 01:09:18.060]   >> You can afford to, and it's not unheard of
[01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:19.660]   to buy market share and search.
[01:09:19.660 --> 01:09:22.260]   As long as the market share doesn't shrivel up
[01:09:22.260 --> 01:09:25.140]   and blow away when you stop buying those ads.
[01:09:25.140 --> 01:09:25.980]   At some point-- >> It looks like
[01:09:25.980 --> 01:09:26.940]   our federal budget.
[01:09:26.940 --> 01:09:29.420]   >> Yeah, at some point you have to make money on this thing.
[01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:30.420]   >> Yeah, right.
[01:09:30.420 --> 01:09:31.860]   >> You can't just keep spending and say,
[01:09:31.860 --> 01:09:34.740]   "Well, we're growing our search share."
[01:09:34.740 --> 01:09:39.620]   Speaking of saving money, I think this is kind of interesting.
[01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:42.300]   Amazon is getting into a price war with iTunes
[01:09:42.300 --> 01:09:45.140]   over the cost of a song.
[01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:48.980]   iTunes, brand new songs, cost as much as $1.29.
[01:09:48.980 --> 01:09:52.620]   Used to be that you could buy the same song
[01:09:52.620 --> 01:09:55.460]   for $0.89 on Amazon.com.
[01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:56.980]   Now 69.
[01:09:56.980 --> 01:09:58.940]   >> And this is why we love competition.
[01:09:58.940 --> 01:10:00.900]   >> Yeah, consumers win, right?
[01:10:00.900 --> 01:10:01.900]   69 cents.
[01:10:01.900 --> 01:10:05.300]   Now I can go pick up that new Rebecca Black song
[01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:08.100]   for a lot less than I can get it on iTunes.
[01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:09.260]   >> Wow.
[01:10:09.260 --> 01:10:12.780]   >> I'm not gonna start saying anything, but wow.
[01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:13.620]   >> Friday.
[01:10:13.620 --> 01:10:14.460]   >> Hey!
[01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:16.740]   >> Knock it off. >> I think this is great,
[01:10:16.740 --> 01:10:21.740]   but for iTunes, Apple has always had this be a,
[01:10:21.740 --> 01:10:26.700]   yeah, they don't make much money off of the music licensing
[01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:27.980]   from iTunes. >> No effect.
[01:10:27.980 --> 01:10:29.660]   >> I think the price jump was not Apple.
[01:10:29.660 --> 01:10:31.380]   It was the record industry that wanted to go up,
[01:10:31.380 --> 01:10:32.460]   which is interesting.
[01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:34.900]   I think what they're maybe so afraid
[01:10:34.900 --> 01:10:37.540]   of the power iTunes is wielding now,
[01:10:37.540 --> 01:10:40.580]   that they're going to Amazon, you can charge less.
[01:10:40.580 --> 01:10:43.340]   >> Is this now a loss leader for Amazon?
[01:10:43.340 --> 01:10:46.220]   >> Does Amazon, you know, Amazon sets the price on apps.
[01:10:46.220 --> 01:10:47.900]   They set the price on books, don't they?
[01:10:47.900 --> 01:10:49.580]   I think they maybe not.
[01:10:49.580 --> 01:10:50.620]   But they do set the price on apps.
[01:10:50.620 --> 01:10:52.620]   I wonder if they're setting the price on--
[01:10:52.620 --> 01:10:55.420]   >> No, they don't remember they got taken to court
[01:10:55.420 --> 01:10:57.540]   by the publishers because the publishers wanted it.
[01:10:57.540 --> 01:11:00.220]   >> They wanted to control the price.
[01:11:00.220 --> 01:11:02.060]   Amazon had to capitulate,
[01:11:02.060 --> 01:11:04.820]   and some of the publishers have more control.
[01:11:04.820 --> 01:11:08.180]   So you would think that the same would apply to music.
[01:11:08.180 --> 01:11:10.180]   >> I don't know, because apps, they do set the price.
[01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:11.020]   >> But you might also think that this is something
[01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:13.660]   that's incenting users to build up their Amazon library
[01:11:13.660 --> 01:11:15.820]   so that they're using Amazon Cloud Drive.
[01:11:15.820 --> 01:11:18.260]   >> Right.
[01:11:18.260 --> 01:11:19.300]   Well, that's the other side of it.
[01:11:19.300 --> 01:11:21.300]   So I buy one song for 69 cents,
[01:11:21.300 --> 01:11:24.220]   and now I get 20 gigs on Cloud Drive for a year.
[01:11:24.220 --> 01:11:26.940]   >> Yeah, if Cloud Drive has up and working.
[01:11:26.940 --> 01:11:27.980]   >> Was it down to--
[01:11:27.980 --> 01:11:29.900]   >> I think you have to buy an album, not a song.
[01:11:29.900 --> 01:11:30.820]   >> Oh, all right.
[01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:33.900]   But they have lots of 99 cent albums, by the way.
[01:11:33.900 --> 01:11:35.580]   >> Oh, well, then they're here.
[01:11:35.580 --> 01:11:37.860]   >> You know what, they've got lots of cheap,
[01:11:37.860 --> 01:11:39.820]   you know, $5 albums they're selling 50 cents.
[01:11:39.820 --> 01:11:42.340]   >> Clayton's Polka album is really cheap on there.
[01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:43.820]   >> Wait a minute, are you a polka--
[01:11:43.820 --> 01:11:44.660]   >> Are you a polka--
[01:11:44.660 --> 01:11:47.020]   >> Are you a polkaist?
[01:11:47.020 --> 01:11:48.340]   >> Wow.
[01:11:48.340 --> 01:11:49.740]   >> I have a--
[01:11:49.740 --> 01:11:51.060]   no, I don't have a polka album.
[01:11:51.060 --> 01:11:52.900]   I was trying to take that and run with it and I couldn't.
[01:11:52.900 --> 01:11:54.700]   (laughing)
[01:11:54.700 --> 01:11:56.500]   >> I didn't want to start a meme that I actually have
[01:11:56.500 --> 01:11:57.340]   an accordion.
[01:11:57.340 --> 01:11:58.540]   >> Clayton's accordion.
[01:11:58.540 --> 01:12:00.020]   Wait a minute, I'm going to look this up,
[01:12:00.020 --> 01:12:02.220]   'cause I think Natalie would not lie about something
[01:12:02.220 --> 01:12:03.060]   like that.
[01:12:03.060 --> 01:12:03.900]   (laughing)
[01:12:03.900 --> 01:12:07.220]   I think you do have a polka album and you're covering it up.
[01:12:07.220 --> 01:12:09.100]   >> That was real cleanser.
[01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:10.500]   I fell in love.
[01:12:10.500 --> 01:12:11.340]   >> I only--
[01:12:11.340 --> 01:12:12.660]   >> What he serenaded me over.
[01:12:12.660 --> 01:12:16.180]   >> She was at an October fest celebration.
[01:12:16.180 --> 01:12:17.860]   I was wearing some sort of kilt.
[01:12:17.860 --> 01:12:20.220]   >> It was Clayton's Oompa.
[01:12:20.220 --> 01:12:22.340]   >> It's the leaderhood then and the accordion.
[01:12:22.340 --> 01:12:23.740]   I'm a sucker for it.
[01:12:23.740 --> 01:12:26.980]   >> No, I searched for Clayton Morris on Amazon,
[01:12:26.980 --> 01:12:30.340]   but it says, "Do you mean Clapton Morris?"
[01:12:30.340 --> 01:12:31.180]   >> All right.
[01:12:31.180 --> 01:12:32.300]   (laughing)
[01:12:32.300 --> 01:12:33.300]   >> No, don't, don't, don't.
[01:12:33.300 --> 01:12:34.180]   >> No polka album.
[01:12:34.180 --> 01:12:35.020]   >> No, no polka album.
[01:12:35.020 --> 01:12:36.820]   >> You have to think that this is some sort of a loss leader
[01:12:36.820 --> 01:12:37.940]   for them and yeah, exactly,
[01:12:37.940 --> 01:12:41.060]   to drive more people to using the cloud storage option.
[01:12:41.060 --> 01:12:43.660]   And I just don't know,
[01:12:43.660 --> 01:12:45.340]   I have this having this debate the other day with someone
[01:12:45.340 --> 01:12:48.780]   about whether or not it's valuable to have this storage
[01:12:48.780 --> 01:12:50.140]   locker in the cloud.
[01:12:50.140 --> 01:12:53.460]   Are we, you know, Steve Jobs has argued that we all want
[01:12:53.460 --> 01:12:54.740]   to own physical media,
[01:12:54.740 --> 01:12:57.020]   but does this give us some sense of ownership
[01:12:57.020 --> 01:12:58.780]   when we put our ones and zeros
[01:12:58.780 --> 01:13:02.060]   in some sort of a sky cloud locker somewhere?
[01:13:02.060 --> 01:13:03.420]   We don't own it anyway.
[01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:06.780]   We don't have access to this physical ones and zeros anyway.
[01:13:06.780 --> 01:13:08.980]   It's not like we're sitting here with a CD in our hands.
[01:13:08.980 --> 01:13:11.220]   >> We had a great interview with Michael Robertson
[01:13:11.220 --> 01:13:12.860]   on triangulation on Wednesday.
[01:13:12.860 --> 01:13:14.900]   He's the guy who did mp3.com
[01:13:14.900 --> 01:13:18.220]   and was chased out of the business by Universal
[01:13:18.220 --> 01:13:19.100]   to suit him and then,
[01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:21.700]   and then when they got the stock price of mp3.com
[01:13:21.700 --> 01:13:23.260]   low enough, they bought it.
[01:13:23.260 --> 01:13:27.620]   So I mean, just a classic, just shark story.
[01:13:27.620 --> 01:13:30.940]   But he, that was the first music locker.
[01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:33.980]   The whole idea of mp3.com was if you have a CD,
[01:13:33.980 --> 01:13:35.540]   you put it in your CD player,
[01:13:35.540 --> 01:13:38.540]   your computer would generate a hash and then say,
[01:13:38.540 --> 01:13:40.780]   "Okay, now you can listen to that without ripping it,
[01:13:40.780 --> 01:13:41.660]   without uploading it.
[01:13:41.660 --> 01:13:44.580]   Now you can listen to that music on mp3.com
[01:13:44.580 --> 01:13:46.660]   'cause you've shown us that you own it.
[01:13:46.660 --> 01:13:49.140]   And even though there was no merit to the lawsuit,
[01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:51.020]   they couldn't afford to defend it.
[01:13:51.020 --> 01:13:51.900]   This is what Michael says.
[01:13:51.900 --> 01:13:54.500]   >> Great interview, you should listen to it on triangulation.
[01:13:54.500 --> 01:13:56.180]   But, and then you,
[01:13:56.180 --> 01:13:58.380]   and Universal even admitted to him afterwards,
[01:13:58.380 --> 01:14:01.940]   Edgar Bronfman celebrating in the closing dinner
[01:14:01.940 --> 01:14:04.220]   after they bought mp3.com.
[01:14:04.220 --> 01:14:06.380]   Even then he said, "Nah, it's just business, man.
[01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:07.660]   It's just business."
[01:14:07.660 --> 01:14:08.860]   We just, we sued you.
[01:14:08.860 --> 01:14:11.800]   So you'd have to sell to us at a lower price.
[01:14:11.800 --> 01:14:16.220]   Just the record industry has such a horrid track record.
[01:14:16.220 --> 01:14:17.980]   It's just amazing.
[01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:20.140]   And of course, there is a cable vision decision.
[01:14:20.140 --> 01:14:23.580]   Remember, cable vision made a online DVR
[01:14:23.580 --> 01:14:25.780]   in which you would record shows
[01:14:25.780 --> 01:14:29.660]   and store it on their cloud for your DVR
[01:14:29.660 --> 01:14:30.900]   instead of a hard drive and that thing.
[01:14:30.900 --> 01:14:32.620]   And was sued by the movie industry.
[01:14:32.620 --> 01:14:35.100]   And one, movie industry lost in that one.
[01:14:35.100 --> 01:14:36.540]   And that's kind of a definitive case.
[01:14:36.540 --> 01:14:40.100]   But do notice that Amazon and anybody else,
[01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:42.660]   you have to, even though they may not even be
[01:14:42.660 --> 01:14:44.020]   keeping a copy of the song.
[01:14:44.020 --> 01:14:45.140]   Who knows how they're actually doing it?
[01:14:45.140 --> 01:14:47.500]   But you have to upload your music.
[01:14:47.500 --> 01:14:48.940]   >> And I think before you could store it in the cloud.
[01:14:48.940 --> 01:14:50.620]   >> And one of the big challenges for the record industry
[01:14:50.620 --> 01:14:52.980]   and the media industry in general is trying,
[01:14:52.980 --> 01:14:54.380]   what they're desperately trying to do
[01:14:54.380 --> 01:14:57.860]   is keep everybody even or try to even this now.
[01:14:57.860 --> 01:14:58.700]   >> That's what I meant.
[01:14:58.700 --> 01:15:01.860]   They're afraid of the power of Apple's iTunes.
[01:15:01.860 --> 01:15:03.820]   So they, maybe are they're thrown a bone to Amazon.
[01:15:03.820 --> 01:15:05.820]   >> And they're trying to do the same thing with Netflix
[01:15:05.820 --> 01:15:07.220]   and they're trying to do the same thing with Google.
[01:15:07.220 --> 01:15:08.060]   >> But what they don't want--
[01:15:08.060 --> 01:15:08.900]   >> But they're playing everybody against each other.
[01:15:08.900 --> 01:15:10.100]   >> What they don't want is anybody to get control
[01:15:10.100 --> 01:15:12.700]   because all of these companies are much more savvy
[01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:13.660]   than they are.
[01:15:13.660 --> 01:15:17.140]   So with Google, Amazon, Apple, Netflix,
[01:15:17.140 --> 01:15:18.500]   these guys are moving much faster.
[01:15:18.500 --> 01:15:20.380]   If any of them get far enough ahead,
[01:15:20.380 --> 01:15:22.180]   they know that they'll start dictating terms,
[01:15:22.180 --> 01:15:24.740]   which interesting left would most likely be good
[01:15:24.740 --> 01:15:26.740]   for the industry because they actually know
[01:15:26.740 --> 01:15:27.660]   what they're doing.
[01:15:27.660 --> 01:15:28.500]   >> Right.
[01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:30.420]   >> But the industry is, I think that they don't know
[01:15:30.420 --> 01:15:31.420]   which way is up at this point.
[01:15:31.420 --> 01:15:32.940]   I think that they can't figure out why people aren't
[01:15:32.940 --> 01:15:35.420]   buying any more DVDs, they can't figure out why people
[01:15:35.420 --> 01:15:36.780]   don't want to buy any more music.
[01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:38.580]   >> What's wrong with you is people.
[01:15:38.580 --> 01:15:40.380]   >> Yeah, and they're trying to figure out
[01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:42.100]   how to stem the bleeding.
[01:15:42.100 --> 01:15:44.700]   >> Let's take a break.
[01:15:44.700 --> 01:15:46.340]   We're going to come back with more,
[01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:48.300]   some big transactions.
[01:15:48.300 --> 01:15:51.580]   Delicious gets sold to Hurley and Chan
[01:15:51.580 --> 01:15:54.220]   from hundreds of dollars.
[01:15:54.220 --> 01:15:57.700]   (laughing)
[01:15:57.700 --> 01:16:01.300]   Logitech makes almost thousands of dollars
[01:16:01.300 --> 01:16:03.580]   on its Google TV and more all coming up.
[01:16:03.580 --> 01:16:05.140]   We're talking big numbers here.
[01:16:05.140 --> 01:16:08.300]   Before we go on though, I want to talk about audible.com.
[01:16:08.300 --> 01:16:09.740]   Show of hands.
[01:16:09.740 --> 01:16:13.460]   Any of you guys listen to audio books by any chance?
[01:16:13.460 --> 01:16:15.060]   >> Oh, the time. >> Absolutely.
[01:16:15.060 --> 01:16:16.300]   Natalie, oh, you do too.
[01:16:16.300 --> 01:16:17.380]   Okay.
[01:16:17.380 --> 01:16:19.380]   You're just being, oh, she was just fixing her hair.
[01:16:19.380 --> 01:16:22.100]   She doesn't really. >> No, I was nodding, yes.
[01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:22.940]   >> We're all big fans.
[01:16:22.940 --> 01:16:24.420]   >> Yes, I'm here. >> I'd be sure.
[01:16:24.420 --> 01:16:25.900]   >> If you listen to audio books
[01:16:25.900 --> 01:16:27.740]   that you're listening to audible.com, right?
[01:16:27.740 --> 01:16:29.660]   I mean, is there a choice?
[01:16:29.660 --> 01:16:31.780]   >> No, not a good one.
[01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:32.900]   >> There's not a choice.
[01:16:32.900 --> 01:16:34.700]   It's a monopoly of audio.
[01:16:34.700 --> 01:16:35.780]   (laughing)
[01:16:35.780 --> 01:16:37.180]   >> They've got a monopoly.
[01:16:37.180 --> 01:16:40.060]   Actually, the library does it and so forth.
[01:16:40.060 --> 01:16:42.460]   But as far as I'm concerned, there's no choice
[01:16:42.460 --> 01:16:44.540]   simply because there's nothing better.
[01:16:44.540 --> 01:16:47.140]   Audible.com has all the greatest books,
[01:16:47.140 --> 01:16:49.700]   70,000 plus titles.
[01:16:49.700 --> 01:16:51.500]   You can play them on pretty much any device,
[01:16:51.500 --> 01:16:53.620]   including of course all the iOS devices,
[01:16:53.620 --> 01:16:55.220]   but also all the Android devices.
[01:16:55.220 --> 01:16:57.700]   In fact, I really love, and I use it all the time,
[01:16:57.700 --> 01:17:00.020]   the audible application on Android.
[01:17:00.020 --> 01:17:02.060]   It's got a great widget so I can see what's playing,
[01:17:02.060 --> 01:17:03.940]   I can see the album art.
[01:17:03.940 --> 01:17:07.140]   I don't have to download books ahead of time.
[01:17:07.140 --> 01:17:11.620]   I see my entire Audible library on my Android or iPhone,
[01:17:11.620 --> 01:17:14.260]   and then pick a book that I want to listen to at the moment.
[01:17:14.260 --> 01:17:16.700]   And what I love, one of the things I love about Audible
[01:17:16.700 --> 01:17:18.540]   is that your library is always available to you.
[01:17:18.540 --> 01:17:20.700]   Unlike iTunes, you can read, download those songs,
[01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:22.980]   or books I'm sorry, anytime you want.
[01:17:22.980 --> 01:17:26.420]   So it is like a library that works on the Kindle effect.
[01:17:26.420 --> 01:17:27.500]   I just got that new Kindle, you know,
[01:17:27.500 --> 01:17:28.820]   the ad supported Kindle.
[01:17:28.820 --> 01:17:30.220]   It's interesting.
[01:17:30.220 --> 01:17:33.020]   Amazon is now putting all your Audible books on there,
[01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:36.700]   as well as the books, the text books that you're reading.
[01:17:36.700 --> 01:17:37.540]   >> Oh, that's great.
[01:17:37.540 --> 01:17:38.540]   >> Isn't that good?
[01:17:38.540 --> 01:17:40.740]   Because they've got three gigs on there.
[01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:42.580]   That's enough for quite a few audio books
[01:17:42.580 --> 01:17:45.300]   in addition to the regular ebooks that you're reading.
[01:17:45.300 --> 01:17:46.140]   I just, I think--
[01:17:46.140 --> 01:17:47.740]   >> I look books now, if they have too many words,
[01:17:47.740 --> 01:17:50.060]   I'm like, this is way too many words for me to read.
[01:17:50.060 --> 01:17:51.500]   I was like, this is a book I'm going to,
[01:17:51.500 --> 01:17:52.540]   I will listen to this book.
[01:17:52.540 --> 01:17:53.380]   You know, but--
[01:17:53.380 --> 01:17:54.580]   >> It's interesting.
[01:17:54.580 --> 01:17:55.900]   It's interesting with the Kindle, too,
[01:17:55.900 --> 01:17:58.620]   because you can do the text to speech on some of the books
[01:17:58.620 --> 01:18:00.540]   if the company allows it.
[01:18:00.540 --> 01:18:02.420]   So you're sitting there with your Audible books,
[01:18:02.420 --> 01:18:03.580]   like on a flight, for instance,
[01:18:03.580 --> 01:18:05.700]   and you've got one that's a text version of the book,
[01:18:05.700 --> 01:18:07.380]   and you can flip it to the text to speech,
[01:18:07.380 --> 01:18:08.860]   and you can also then jump over and listen
[01:18:08.860 --> 01:18:11.540]   to your Audible books on there with a voice actor
[01:18:11.540 --> 01:18:12.980]   who does it better than that robotic voice.
[01:18:12.980 --> 01:18:14.140]   >> Well, I have to say, I mean, if you're,
[01:18:14.140 --> 01:18:16.900]   if you're, for instance, listening to Rob Lowe's
[01:18:16.900 --> 01:18:21.020]   unabridged memoir stories, I only tell my friends,
[01:18:21.020 --> 01:18:24.300]   do you want to hear somebody that sounds like this, read it?
[01:18:24.300 --> 01:18:27.820]   Or do you want to hear Rob Lowe himself read it?
[01:18:27.820 --> 01:18:29.900]   Let's listen a little Rob Lowe.
[01:18:29.900 --> 01:18:31.300]   I'm just curious what the stories are
[01:18:31.300 --> 01:18:32.620]   that he only tells to his friends.
[01:18:32.620 --> 01:18:35.540]   This is one of 70,000 titles.
[01:18:35.540 --> 01:18:37.900]   If you go to audible.com/twit2,
[01:18:37.900 --> 01:18:40.240]   you can pick the first two of them free.
[01:18:41.220 --> 01:18:43.940]   Come on, Rob, I want to hear you, man.
[01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:47.780]   >> Currents of fame, dating, career ups and downs,
[01:18:47.780 --> 01:18:49.980]   curious to see how his life would play out.
[01:18:49.980 --> 01:18:50.820]   >> I love Rob Lowe.
[01:18:50.820 --> 01:18:52.780]   >> Sometimes, he and I both appear in those two.
[01:18:52.780 --> 01:18:53.620]   >> I didn't know anything.
[01:18:53.620 --> 01:18:56.340]   I've never actually seen him talk, and to my wife,
[01:18:56.340 --> 01:18:57.940]   it wasn't me, I'm just trying to--
[01:18:57.940 --> 01:18:58.780]   >> Your wife.
[01:18:58.780 --> 01:19:01.380]   >> My wife was watching Rob Lowe on Oprah,
[01:19:01.380 --> 01:19:03.340]   I guess like yesterday or the day before,
[01:19:03.340 --> 01:19:04.980]   she had recorded it and she was playing it.
[01:19:04.980 --> 01:19:07.220]   I found myself, I got hooked into an Oprah show.
[01:19:07.220 --> 01:19:09.540]   He's like, he's like so level headed,
[01:19:09.540 --> 01:19:12.740]   and so he's got all this up and I was just like,
[01:19:12.740 --> 01:19:14.340]   wow, he was so good in the West Wing.
[01:19:14.340 --> 01:19:15.180]   What is he doing lately?
[01:19:15.180 --> 01:19:15.820]   Is he having a new show?
[01:19:15.820 --> 01:19:16.820]   He must be if he's anywhere.
[01:19:16.820 --> 01:19:19.060]   >> He was in that Sally Field show,
[01:19:19.060 --> 01:19:20.780]   he was like a politician or something.
[01:19:20.780 --> 01:19:21.620]   I only know 'cause my mom was a mom.
[01:19:21.620 --> 01:19:22.660]   >> Brothers and sisters.
[01:19:22.660 --> 01:19:23.660]   >> Oh, that's right.
[01:19:23.660 --> 01:19:24.900]   >> Yeah, yeah.
[01:19:24.900 --> 01:19:25.980]   Yeah, I'm glad I missed that.
[01:19:25.980 --> 01:19:28.060]   I'm not a Sally Field fan.
[01:19:28.060 --> 01:19:28.900]   >> She was great at flying.
[01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:30.220]   >> Like, how can you not be a Sally Field fan?
[01:19:30.220 --> 01:19:32.060]   >> You love Sally Field, really?
[01:19:32.060 --> 01:19:33.060]   >> Yeah, she like her.
[01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:34.420]   >> You really like her?
[01:19:34.420 --> 01:19:35.820]   >> She really loves her.
[01:19:35.820 --> 01:19:37.540]   >> She really, really does.
[01:19:37.540 --> 01:19:39.100]   Hey, can I see something real quick about the app,
[01:19:39.100 --> 01:19:39.940]   the Audible app?
[01:19:39.940 --> 01:19:40.780]   >> Yeah.
[01:19:40.780 --> 01:19:43.300]   >> 'Cause I really started using it a lot since Christmas.
[01:19:43.300 --> 01:19:44.620]   I was just always downloading the books
[01:19:44.620 --> 01:19:46.300]   and putting them on my iPhone,
[01:19:46.300 --> 01:19:48.620]   but now because you sign up for the plan,
[01:19:48.620 --> 01:19:51.620]   you, the monthly gold package or whatever I have,
[01:19:51.620 --> 01:19:54.380]   you get free access to both either the New York Times
[01:19:54.380 --> 01:19:55.380]   or the Wall Street Journal.
[01:19:55.380 --> 01:19:56.780]   >> I get a free download of that.
[01:19:56.780 --> 01:19:57.620]   That's right.
[01:19:57.620 --> 01:20:00.460]   >> Paper, and I love it because also in the application
[01:20:00.460 --> 01:20:02.260]   and nowhere else can you have access to do this,
[01:20:02.260 --> 01:20:05.380]   you can do it like in triple speed.
[01:20:05.380 --> 01:20:08.020]   So, I have to read copious amounts of news, right?
[01:20:08.020 --> 01:20:09.940]   So, I try to read all kinds of stuff,
[01:20:09.940 --> 01:20:12.020]   and then if I'm doing something with a baby or something,
[01:20:12.020 --> 01:20:16.700]   I'll put on the New York Times audio download
[01:20:16.700 --> 01:20:19.100]   from that morning, which publishes every morning at 6.30,
[01:20:19.100 --> 01:20:20.500]   they push out the picture. >> I have to start doing this.
[01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:21.340]   That's brilliant.
[01:20:21.340 --> 01:20:22.180]   >> And it's free.
[01:20:22.180 --> 01:20:23.820]   I mean, if you've got the plan, it's free.
[01:20:23.820 --> 01:20:26.540]   You can sign up for either one and you can switch at any time.
[01:20:26.540 --> 01:20:28.100]   If you wanted to go over to Wall Street Journal.
[01:20:28.100 --> 01:20:29.900]   >> At the triple speed, how long does it take you
[01:20:29.900 --> 01:20:32.140]   to read the New York to listen to the New York?
[01:20:32.140 --> 01:20:34.220]   >> 'Cause it's usually an hour, so if you do it at half speed,
[01:20:34.220 --> 01:20:36.140]   it's about a half hour, about 15 minutes,
[01:20:36.140 --> 01:20:38.740]   and get through the New York Times.
[01:20:38.740 --> 01:20:40.660]   >> That's two deeper changes. >> I can't do three.
[01:20:40.660 --> 01:20:42.700]   >> That is so amazing.
[01:20:42.700 --> 01:20:45.060]   I have a trampoline. >> And the guy does it in a way
[01:20:45.060 --> 01:20:46.460]   that's agreeable.
[01:20:46.460 --> 01:20:47.740]   He talks like this normally.
[01:20:47.740 --> 01:20:50.500]   Welcome to the New York Times audio edition.
[01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:54.500]   Today, he gives up the three speed, and then you're fine.
[01:20:54.500 --> 01:20:56.180]   >> Yeah, he talks normally.
[01:20:56.180 --> 01:20:57.020]   >> Right.
[01:20:57.020 --> 01:20:58.300]   >> Audible.com, here's my record.
[01:20:58.300 --> 01:21:00.700]   I'll let you guys want to make a recommendation, you can,
[01:21:00.700 --> 01:21:03.260]   but I just noticed the childhood's end,
[01:21:03.260 --> 01:21:05.740]   the classic Arthur C. Clark science fiction,
[01:21:05.740 --> 01:21:08.540]   with the greatest twist ending of all time,
[01:21:08.540 --> 01:21:10.620]   is available on Audible.
[01:21:10.620 --> 01:21:12.100]   >> I'm sorry, guys, I'm sorry.
[01:21:12.100 --> 01:21:14.260]   I was trying to mute the microphone in it, though.
[01:21:14.260 --> 01:21:15.780]   >> You just don't like her at the C. Clark.
[01:21:15.780 --> 01:21:18.300]   Go ahead, you could pick a book. >> I'm sorry.
[01:21:18.300 --> 01:21:20.940]   >> You want to pick Tina Fey's bossy pants?
[01:21:20.940 --> 01:21:22.220]   You go right ahead.
[01:21:22.220 --> 01:21:23.380]   >> No.
[01:21:23.380 --> 01:21:24.580]   >> She is reading, what are you reading
[01:21:24.580 --> 01:21:25.980]   about schools right now?
[01:21:25.980 --> 01:21:29.460]   It's a really-- >> Yes, I'm reading the Diane Ravitch book,
[01:21:29.460 --> 01:21:31.420]   The Life and Death of the American School System.
[01:21:31.420 --> 01:21:32.580]   It's getting me all worked up.
[01:21:32.580 --> 01:21:35.460]   >> You are such an intellectual, Natalie.
[01:21:35.460 --> 01:21:40.460]   I'm always blown away by the depth of your knowledge.
[01:21:40.460 --> 01:21:43.620]   >> She's very close to getting her PhD, so yeah,
[01:21:43.620 --> 01:21:46.180]   she is a nerd, she is a nerd of the highest order.
[01:21:46.180 --> 01:21:47.740]   >> So I did a search for Diane Ravitch,
[01:21:47.740 --> 01:21:49.740]   those books aren't in there, but look at this.
[01:21:49.740 --> 01:21:51.820]   Her interview on C-Spans book notes,
[01:21:51.820 --> 01:21:53.500]   her interview on the Bob Edwards show,
[01:21:53.500 --> 01:21:55.100]   her interview on Fresh Air,
[01:21:55.100 --> 01:21:56.980]   these are all on Audible,
[01:21:56.980 --> 01:21:58.340]   so they have radio shows as well.
[01:21:58.340 --> 01:21:59.980]   I mean, this is, it's incredible.
[01:21:59.980 --> 01:22:01.460]   You probably would want to listen to this interview
[01:22:01.460 --> 01:22:03.620]   with her from the Fresh Air program.
[01:22:03.620 --> 01:22:05.900]   I'll tell you, Audible.com, it's amazing.
[01:22:05.900 --> 01:22:09.380]   Two books free, your first month is free,
[01:22:09.380 --> 01:22:11.460]   and on the platinum plane you get two books a month,
[01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:15.020]   that's what I use, Audible.com/twit2.
[01:22:15.020 --> 01:22:16.780]   And yes, when you sign up for that plan,
[01:22:16.780 --> 01:22:18.740]   you also get the New York Times or Wall Street Journal,
[01:22:18.740 --> 01:22:20.180]   and you can listen to that every single day.
[01:22:20.180 --> 01:22:21.620]   And I'm gonna do your tip, Clayton,
[01:22:21.620 --> 01:22:23.540]   I think that's a great idea.
[01:22:23.540 --> 01:22:24.940]   >> I love it, and you can switch it anytime
[01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:25.860]   as far as I understand.
[01:22:25.860 --> 01:22:27.220]   So Wall Street Journal one month,
[01:22:27.220 --> 01:22:29.300]   you want to switch over to get New York Times,
[01:22:29.300 --> 01:22:30.340]   and they do the column every day,
[01:22:30.340 --> 01:22:32.580]   and they pick some really great content to put up there,
[01:22:32.580 --> 01:22:33.620]   so very good.
[01:22:33.620 --> 01:22:34.500]   >> I'm gonna definitely do that.
[01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:37.220]   They have a lot of magazines and periodicals.
[01:22:37.220 --> 01:22:39.860]   So Logitech's fourth quarter results came out,
[01:22:39.860 --> 01:22:42.220]   and we found out one thing I thought was kind of interesting.
[01:22:42.220 --> 01:22:43.500]   They make the Google TV,
[01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:46.220]   they're really the only one that makes a,
[01:22:46.220 --> 01:22:48.660]   there's a Google TV part of a Blu-ray player,
[01:22:48.660 --> 01:22:50.660]   but this is the only standalone Google TV.
[01:22:50.660 --> 01:22:53.900]   Big profits, $5 million.
[01:22:53.900 --> 01:22:57.620]   Five million, this is such a piece of crap, I'm sorry.
[01:22:57.620 --> 01:22:59.500]   This is such a horrible product.
[01:23:01.340 --> 01:23:06.140]   Google, I'm sure, intended to sell a lot more of these.
[01:23:06.140 --> 01:23:10.340]   Logitech, I'm sure, the Logitech CEO says he's still
[01:23:10.340 --> 01:23:13.140]   enthusiastic about Google TV,
[01:23:13.140 --> 01:23:16.780]   but notice they have also scaled back their marketing,
[01:23:16.780 --> 01:23:19.460]   and I think this is just a matter of time.
[01:23:19.460 --> 01:23:20.300]   Why Google's just--
[01:23:20.300 --> 01:23:23.460]   >> I think the Logitech review just blows away the Apple TV.
[01:23:23.460 --> 01:23:24.300]   >> Really?
[01:23:24.300 --> 01:23:25.820]   Do you use it?
[01:23:25.820 --> 01:23:26.660]   >> No.
[01:23:26.660 --> 01:23:29.300]   (laughing)
[01:23:29.300 --> 01:23:31.780]   Actually, it blows it away in terms of capabilities,
[01:23:31.780 --> 01:23:33.580]   but it's so complicated, convoluted,
[01:23:33.580 --> 01:23:35.340]   and I don't use it now.
[01:23:35.340 --> 01:23:37.780]   I have the new Apple TV.
[01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:38.860]   >> Yeah.
[01:23:38.860 --> 01:23:43.860]   >> It just doesn't do enough, it's iTunes and Hulu.
[01:23:43.860 --> 01:23:45.420]   No, what else is Netflix?
[01:23:45.420 --> 01:23:46.740]   iTunes and Netflix, that's it.
[01:23:46.740 --> 01:23:48.940]   >> I'm MLB, for me, I watch all my films--
[01:23:48.940 --> 01:23:51.260]   >> Well, you watch it, MLB is great,
[01:23:51.260 --> 01:23:52.940]   and the interface, and Alex, you've talked about this
[01:23:52.940 --> 01:23:54.380]   on that right before, the interface,
[01:23:54.380 --> 01:23:56.380]   the Netflix interface, the buffering is better
[01:23:56.380 --> 01:24:00.020]   on the Apple TV as opposed to Roku,
[01:24:00.020 --> 01:24:02.340]   just as it's cleaner, it's nicer.
[01:24:02.340 --> 01:24:04.260]   >> I really have to try it for that reason, okay.
[01:24:04.260 --> 01:24:06.580]   >> And I can control it with my iPhone.
[01:24:06.580 --> 01:24:08.060]   >> Well, I can do that with my Roku too.
[01:24:08.060 --> 01:24:08.900]   >> You can do that with the Roku?
[01:24:08.900 --> 01:24:09.740]   I have an iPhone.
[01:24:09.740 --> 01:24:10.660]   >> Yeah, there's a Roku app.
[01:24:10.660 --> 01:24:11.500]   >> Is there a Roku app?
[01:24:11.500 --> 01:24:12.340]   >> Yeah, okay, well I missed that.
[01:24:12.340 --> 01:24:13.700]   >> At least on Android, I have that.
[01:24:13.700 --> 01:24:14.540]   >> 'Cause I had the--
[01:24:14.540 --> 01:24:15.900]   >> But right, the Logitech review,
[01:24:15.900 --> 01:24:18.020]   just incredibly ridiculous,
[01:24:18.020 --> 01:24:19.140]   it was at the launch event,
[01:24:19.140 --> 01:24:20.980]   and then to set the thing up,
[01:24:20.980 --> 01:24:23.060]   you had to have multiple accounts,
[01:24:23.060 --> 01:24:25.060]   you had to make sure you had this set up, this set up,
[01:24:25.060 --> 01:24:27.300]   and it wasn't accessing any of the content,
[01:24:27.300 --> 01:24:28.460]   then if you wanted to jump over to Hulu,
[01:24:28.460 --> 01:24:29.660]   you couldn't get access to Hulu.
[01:24:29.660 --> 01:24:30.500]   >> Very fast, right.
[01:24:30.500 --> 01:24:33.220]   >> So very, I mean, very, very nerdy device.
[01:24:33.220 --> 01:24:34.980]   >> I'm disappointed, I was hoping it would be better,
[01:24:34.980 --> 01:24:36.220]   I really was.
[01:24:36.220 --> 01:24:37.660]   'Cause again, competition.
[01:24:37.660 --> 01:24:39.980]   >> Yeah, very expensive, $2.99, yeah.
[01:24:39.980 --> 01:24:40.860]   >> I would like to see something,
[01:24:40.860 --> 01:24:42.420]   I mean, I think that there's a lot of places
[01:24:42.420 --> 01:24:44.220]   that Apple TV could improve,
[01:24:44.220 --> 01:24:45.660]   I'd love to see it, like for instance,
[01:24:45.660 --> 01:24:48.500]   be able to connect a webcam, you know,
[01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:50.220]   and I'd love to see them open up the iOS,
[01:24:50.220 --> 01:24:52.580]   I wish that they would get pushed a little bit
[01:24:52.580 --> 01:24:53.780]   to open that up,
[01:24:53.780 --> 01:24:57.660]   but I have to admit that once I put the Apple TV into one,
[01:24:57.660 --> 01:25:00.060]   I went to the next, you know, and installed it,
[01:25:00.060 --> 01:25:01.580]   and it's just, it's easy for me to use,
[01:25:01.580 --> 01:25:03.780]   it's easy for Carly to to use.
[01:25:03.780 --> 01:25:06.380]   >> One big complaint I have about the Apple TV,
[01:25:06.380 --> 01:25:09.820]   for instance, the new AMC show The Killing as an example,
[01:25:09.820 --> 01:25:13.660]   came out, I forgot to DVR it,
[01:25:13.660 --> 01:25:15.460]   so I was gonna grab a few episodes,
[01:25:15.460 --> 01:25:17.860]   Natalie refuses to watch it,
[01:25:17.860 --> 01:25:19.180]   because it's about killing.
[01:25:19.180 --> 01:25:21.380]   (laughing)
[01:25:21.380 --> 01:25:22.780]   >> So, apparently.
[01:25:22.780 --> 01:25:26.420]   >> Yeah, so I wanted to rent it and throw it up on AirPlay
[01:25:26.420 --> 01:25:27.500]   and just put it up on my Apple TV,
[01:25:27.500 --> 01:25:29.300]   or just go through my Apple TV and rent it and watch it,
[01:25:29.300 --> 01:25:30.140]   you can't.
[01:25:30.140 --> 01:25:31.620]   There's no sign of it anywhere,
[01:25:31.620 --> 01:25:33.900]   when you go into iTunes on the Apple TV,
[01:25:33.900 --> 01:25:35.820]   or when you go through the interface on Apple TV,
[01:25:35.820 --> 01:25:37.660]   but then when I jump into the App Store,
[01:25:37.660 --> 01:25:40.380]   or jump into iTunes on my iPad, it's right there.
[01:25:40.380 --> 01:25:42.900]   I can rent every episode, I can buy the whole season,
[01:25:42.900 --> 01:25:45.420]   get a full season pass and watch it that way.
[01:25:45.420 --> 01:25:46.780]   Makes absolutely no sense,
[01:25:46.780 --> 01:25:49.900]   this content fracturing on these devices,
[01:25:49.900 --> 01:25:51.500]   and I get really frustrated,
[01:25:51.500 --> 01:25:53.540]   so we're gonna fly into San Francisco tomorrow,
[01:25:53.540 --> 01:25:56.100]   I'm gonna load up a few episodes of it,
[01:25:56.100 --> 01:25:57.780]   I'll have to rent them, I have to buy them,
[01:25:57.780 --> 01:25:59.300]   but then if I wanna go through the Apple TV
[01:25:59.300 --> 01:26:00.580]   to watch them, I can't,
[01:26:00.580 --> 01:26:02.260]   unless I use AirPlay to throw it up there,
[01:26:02.260 --> 01:26:03.220]   makes no sense.
[01:26:03.220 --> 01:26:07.940]   >> Yeah, I'm sure that it has to do with,
[01:26:07.940 --> 01:26:10.740]   the licensing that they're stuck within,
[01:26:10.740 --> 01:26:13.140]   but I do think that it is,
[01:26:13.140 --> 01:26:14.540]   all this media stuff is just gonna continue
[01:26:14.540 --> 01:26:16.020]   to get more and more sticky.
[01:26:16.020 --> 01:26:17.180]   I think that's the issue,
[01:26:17.180 --> 01:26:18.460]   is 'cause everyone's trying to protect it all.
[01:26:18.460 --> 01:26:23.460]   >> People are sensitive, big story on wired.com,
[01:26:23.460 --> 01:26:28.460]   the age of broadband caps begins tomorrow, 18Ts,
[01:26:28.460 --> 01:26:32.100]   I'm sorry, we'll we're leaving you out here,
[01:26:32.100 --> 01:26:34.300]   if you, if there's anything you have to,
[01:26:34.300 --> 01:26:37.580]   I know you don't get to Apple TV,
[01:26:37.580 --> 01:26:38.900]   you don't get Google TV,
[01:26:38.900 --> 01:26:40.060]   and now you don't get broadband.
[01:26:40.060 --> 01:26:41.060]   >> Did you get Apple TV?
[01:26:41.060 --> 01:26:41.900]   >> Oh, you do, okay.
[01:26:41.900 --> 01:26:42.740]   >> Apple one.
[01:26:42.740 --> 01:26:43.780]   >> Oh, never mind.
[01:26:43.780 --> 01:26:46.140]   >> It doesn't work very well, but we still haven't.
[01:26:46.140 --> 01:26:46.980]   (laughing)
[01:26:46.980 --> 01:26:48.260]   >> You can't put anything on it.
[01:26:48.260 --> 01:26:49.100]   >> And then meanwhile,
[01:26:49.100 --> 01:26:51.180]   and that was just falling over, so.
[01:26:51.180 --> 01:26:52.620]   (laughing)
[01:26:52.620 --> 01:26:54.100]   >> No, but the broadband caps,
[01:26:54.100 --> 01:26:55.660]   we're very okay with here, so.
[01:26:55.660 --> 01:26:57.700]   >> What are your broadband caps?
[01:26:57.700 --> 01:26:59.100]   >> Ah, they're not that bad.
[01:26:59.100 --> 01:27:03.860]   >> I think any cap is bad by its very nature.
[01:27:03.860 --> 01:27:06.700]   >> Yes, but we do, we have pretty,
[01:27:06.700 --> 01:27:11.100]   I'd say pretty decent ones on cellular data.
[01:27:11.100 --> 01:27:14.780]   So my iPhone has like a three gigabyte cap.
[01:27:14.780 --> 01:27:17.940]   >> Wow, awfully low.
[01:27:17.940 --> 01:27:20.780]   >> I went through three gigs of my iPad very quickly.
[01:27:20.780 --> 01:27:21.620]   >> Yeah.
[01:27:21.620 --> 01:27:22.460]   >> Really, what were you doing?
[01:27:22.460 --> 01:27:23.300]   >> Yeah, that sounds like.
[01:27:23.300 --> 01:27:26.300]   >> I have to recommend, now of course,
[01:27:26.300 --> 01:27:28.140]   because I, you know, Grandfather didn't have the unlimited
[01:27:28.140 --> 01:27:30.740]   data plan on my iPad from the first generation,
[01:27:30.740 --> 01:27:32.780]   and friends, and segments that I do.
[01:27:32.780 --> 01:27:33.940]   What do you recommend?
[01:27:33.940 --> 01:27:36.140]   Should I get, you know, the low of the bandwidth.
[01:27:36.140 --> 01:27:36.980]   >> You're gonna need five gigs.
[01:27:36.980 --> 01:27:37.820]   >> You're gonna need five gigs,
[01:27:37.820 --> 01:27:39.220]   unless somebody, it really depends on usage,
[01:27:39.220 --> 01:27:40.540]   if you use Wi-Fi all the time.
[01:27:40.540 --> 01:27:42.700]   I was just downloading porn on the airplane,
[01:27:42.700 --> 01:27:44.780]   and I think that's really what, yeah.
[01:27:44.780 --> 01:27:46.180]   >> Well, that's your problem.
[01:27:46.180 --> 01:27:47.020]   (laughing)
[01:27:47.020 --> 01:27:48.060]   >> I'm trying to get the entire model.
[01:27:48.060 --> 01:27:50.500]   >> Not that I know.
[01:27:50.500 --> 01:27:52.340]   >> Yeah, that's--
[01:27:52.340 --> 01:27:53.580]   >> You can do that on planes.
[01:27:53.580 --> 01:27:54.580]   >> No.
[01:27:54.580 --> 01:27:55.420]   >> Silly.
[01:27:55.420 --> 01:27:56.260]   >> Silly me.
[01:27:56.260 --> 01:27:59.020]   >> And I have complained about the Comcast cap,
[01:27:59.020 --> 01:28:02.260]   although I realized that in talking to Comcast,
[01:28:02.260 --> 01:28:04.660]   'cause I'm upgrading to the one at my house,
[01:28:04.660 --> 01:28:06.300]   I never actually hit it.
[01:28:06.300 --> 01:28:09.380]   I thought that I would definitely hit the Comcast cap,
[01:28:09.380 --> 01:28:10.580]   because of my usage.
[01:28:10.580 --> 01:28:13.500]   >> 250 gigs, sooner to gigs, and I have come close.
[01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:15.660]   I looked at a, you know, I started talking to him,
[01:28:15.660 --> 01:28:17.060]   and I hadn't looked through it and everything else,
[01:28:17.060 --> 01:28:20.100]   and I've hit 235.
[01:28:20.100 --> 01:28:22.620]   >> There's anyone, if there's anyone that would,
[01:28:22.620 --> 01:28:25.220]   it would be you and Pirate Day.
[01:28:25.220 --> 01:28:26.900]   >> Yeah, but that's what these guys say.
[01:28:26.900 --> 01:28:27.740]   >> But I'm uploading.
[01:28:27.740 --> 01:28:29.660]   >> But I'm up, they say 99% of our users never come near them.
[01:28:29.660 --> 01:28:32.540]   The AT&T cap is lower, it's 150 gigs,
[01:28:32.540 --> 01:28:34.380]   if you're a DSL subscriber, 250,
[01:28:34.380 --> 01:28:36.380]   or if you're a U-verse subscriber.
[01:28:36.380 --> 01:28:38.100]   I guess the point, and by the way--
[01:28:38.100 --> 01:28:40.100]   >> You couldn't download 250 gigs on U-verse.
[01:28:40.100 --> 01:28:41.900]   I don't mean to be so rough about it, but man.
[01:28:41.900 --> 01:28:42.740]   >> Well, that's the problem.
[01:28:42.740 --> 01:28:43.740]   >> So bad.
[01:28:43.740 --> 01:28:44.700]   >> Yeah, that's the solution,
[01:28:44.700 --> 01:28:45.860]   is make your service so crappy,
[01:28:45.860 --> 01:28:47.780]   nobody's ever gonna hit the cap.
[01:28:47.780 --> 01:28:51.260]   But I just think that this is both AT&T and Comcast,
[01:28:51.260 --> 01:28:52.700]   has nothing to do with,
[01:28:52.700 --> 01:28:54.580]   oh, you guys are using too much data,
[01:28:54.580 --> 01:28:56.620]   or let's punish bandwidth hogs,
[01:28:56.620 --> 01:28:58.820]   it has everything to do with getting in play.
[01:28:58.820 --> 01:29:00.580]   It's the camel's nose in the tent,
[01:29:00.580 --> 01:29:03.300]   it's getting in place so that as more and more people
[01:29:03.300 --> 01:29:06.620]   start using Netflix and iTunes and everything else,
[01:29:06.620 --> 01:29:09.380]   you know, they can slowly clamp down on it,
[01:29:09.380 --> 01:29:11.180]   'cause they really just want you to do email
[01:29:11.180 --> 01:29:16.180]   and somebody's getting a call on their iPhone.
[01:29:16.180 --> 01:29:17.460]   Maybe it's me.
[01:29:17.460 --> 01:29:21.060]   >> Could be me. >> I'm in there.
[01:29:21.060 --> 01:29:22.700]   >> Okay, everybody looked--
[01:29:22.700 --> 01:29:24.700]   >> That's the new ringtone, by the way.
[01:29:24.700 --> 01:29:25.700]   It's not--
[01:29:29.540 --> 01:29:31.380]   >> I wanna record that and make that my ringtone.
[01:29:31.380 --> 01:29:33.660]   That would be a GSM sound.
[01:29:33.660 --> 01:29:35.540]   >> Then everyone would just be looking around.
[01:29:35.540 --> 01:29:37.700]   >> Yeah, right, what's going on, what's going on?
[01:29:37.700 --> 01:29:39.220]   >> I think you're dead rightly,
[01:29:39.220 --> 01:29:41.540]   but I think the reason that these people are,
[01:29:41.540 --> 01:29:45.900]   the networks are so obsessed with bandwidth caps,
[01:29:45.900 --> 01:29:49.140]   is 'cause they can see a time when nobody really needs to buy
[01:29:49.140 --> 01:29:54.460]   your cable service, you don't need cable to get movies or TV,
[01:29:54.460 --> 01:29:58.740]   you just get it all over iTunes or IP or Netflix
[01:29:58.740 --> 01:30:00.220]   or something like that.
[01:30:00.220 --> 01:30:01.940]   >> Especially as live streaming starts picking up speed.
[01:30:01.940 --> 01:30:03.100]   >> Well, it is. >> That's the last little--
[01:30:03.100 --> 01:30:06.260]   >> What do we see, the Netflix is like 40% of prime time ban
[01:30:06.260 --> 01:30:07.420]   with consumption in the US.
[01:30:07.420 --> 01:30:09.940]   I mean, it is, we're all sitting there watching Netflix.
[01:30:09.940 --> 01:30:11.380]   >> Well, there's Netflix, but when you start looking
[01:30:11.380 --> 01:30:13.820]   at this stuff like the president doing open--
[01:30:13.820 --> 01:30:14.660]   >> Facebook.
[01:30:14.660 --> 01:30:16.740]   >> On Facebook and then you look at the royal wedding
[01:30:16.740 --> 01:30:19.060]   and you start seeing all of the streaming happening.
[01:30:19.060 --> 01:30:24.060]   Once news and sports become regular live streaming events,
[01:30:24.060 --> 01:30:27.180]   there's no reason that would be.
[01:30:27.180 --> 01:30:30.540]   >> And obviously both you and I have a vested interest
[01:30:30.540 --> 01:30:33.260]   in this will because we're internet broadcasters.
[01:30:33.260 --> 01:30:34.580]   Cap's-- >> Yeah, you.
[01:30:37.060 --> 01:30:37.900]   It's a problem.
[01:30:37.900 --> 01:30:38.740]   >> Yeah, channel flip.
[01:30:38.740 --> 01:30:41.420]   I mean, you're aspiring to be a television network
[01:30:41.420 --> 01:30:42.580]   over the internet, right?
[01:30:42.580 --> 01:30:48.220]   >> Yeah, and so I think, you know, over here,
[01:30:48.220 --> 01:30:49.980]   we're already starting to see it,
[01:30:49.980 --> 01:30:53.900]   albeit with phone companies rather than cable companies
[01:30:53.900 --> 01:30:55.700]   where people are starting to question, you know,
[01:30:55.700 --> 01:30:58.380]   we have to pay all this money to have a, you know,
[01:30:58.380 --> 01:31:02.220]   effectively over here, if you have to have a phone line
[01:31:02.220 --> 01:31:03.900]   to have internet and have people saying,
[01:31:03.900 --> 01:31:05.140]   well, I don't really need a phone line
[01:31:05.140 --> 01:31:06.300]   'cause I have a cell phone.
[01:31:06.300 --> 01:31:08.660]   So why can't I just have internet
[01:31:08.660 --> 01:31:09.980]   and all the phone companies are saying,
[01:31:09.980 --> 01:31:12.580]   well, we don't want you to really just have the internet
[01:31:12.580 --> 01:31:14.860]   because then we won't really make any money.
[01:31:14.860 --> 01:31:18.020]   So, you know, the same thing is happening over here.
[01:31:18.020 --> 01:31:18.860]   >> It's bare-dewing.
[01:31:18.860 --> 01:31:20.740]   >> But you have to get a phone line
[01:31:20.740 --> 01:31:22.220]   no matter what in your package?
[01:31:22.220 --> 01:31:24.260]   >> Well, they don't have cable companies, right?
[01:31:24.260 --> 01:31:25.740]   >> 'Cause we don't really have cable.
[01:31:25.740 --> 01:31:28.980]   >> So all of the services through the phone.
[01:31:28.980 --> 01:31:30.900]   So you really in a worse competitive situation,
[01:31:30.900 --> 01:31:32.500]   at least in the States, you usually have a choice
[01:31:32.500 --> 01:31:34.860]   between cable and a phone company.
[01:31:34.860 --> 01:31:36.700]   >> Yeah, so generally over here,
[01:31:36.700 --> 01:31:40.180]   you can't most, you know, everywhere obviously has a phone.
[01:31:40.180 --> 01:31:43.020]   So you can have DSL and you can choose between
[01:31:43.020 --> 01:31:46.740]   your DSL providers, but you still have to have,
[01:31:46.740 --> 01:31:50.780]   you still have to pay for a phone
[01:31:50.780 --> 01:31:52.180]   because you have to have the phone service,
[01:31:52.180 --> 01:31:53.740]   to have the DSL service.
[01:31:53.740 --> 01:31:56.380]   And so people are saying, well, why is that,
[01:31:56.380 --> 01:31:57.620]   you know, why is that really?
[01:31:57.620 --> 01:32:00.140]   It's the same, why can't I just have internet
[01:32:00.140 --> 01:32:01.100]   and not have phone?
[01:32:01.100 --> 01:32:03.580]   If you're in a place in England where you can get cable,
[01:32:03.580 --> 01:32:07.420]   most people who can do because it's faster
[01:32:07.420 --> 01:32:09.740]   and the package is generally better.
[01:32:09.740 --> 01:32:11.340]   >> You know what something sticks out to me and all this?
[01:32:11.340 --> 01:32:14.860]   I'm reading the new In The Plex, the Steven Lovey book.
[01:32:14.860 --> 01:32:15.700]   >> Oh, it's not a great book.
[01:32:15.700 --> 01:32:16.540]   >> Oh, it's fantastic.
[01:32:16.540 --> 01:32:17.740]   >> And you know, it's a terrible name.
[01:32:17.740 --> 01:32:18.580]   >> Yeah.
[01:32:18.580 --> 01:32:20.300]   >> You know, Steven was on,
[01:32:20.300 --> 01:32:22.580]   to this week in Google on Wednesday
[01:32:22.580 --> 01:32:24.340]   and he was saying, oh yeah, we went back and forth
[01:32:24.340 --> 01:32:25.700]   about the name and we decided on this one
[01:32:25.700 --> 01:32:27.380]   and I wanted to say, boy, you made it up.
[01:32:27.380 --> 01:32:28.940]   How long are you thinking?
[01:32:28.940 --> 01:32:29.780]   >> Boy, bad choice.
[01:32:29.780 --> 01:32:31.700]   >> Yeah, I didn't say that, I should have, but.
[01:32:31.700 --> 01:32:33.780]   >> But Larry Page, you get from the book, you know,
[01:32:33.780 --> 01:32:36.940]   and you really get this big thinking person in Larry Page
[01:32:36.940 --> 01:32:39.140]   and you know, I want to build this monorail system.
[01:32:39.140 --> 01:32:43.500]   And I feel like this issue that we're just talking about
[01:32:43.500 --> 01:32:46.460]   is an area where Google could once just swoop in
[01:32:46.460 --> 01:32:47.460]   and say, you know what,
[01:32:47.460 --> 01:32:50.700]   incredible high speed internet access
[01:32:50.700 --> 01:32:53.420]   for every community in America, we're just going to cover it.
[01:32:53.420 --> 01:32:54.900]   We have the money in the bank, we're going to build it,
[01:32:54.900 --> 01:32:55.860]   we're going to cover it.
[01:32:55.860 --> 01:32:57.420]   They're already doing it in certain communities
[01:32:57.420 --> 01:32:58.660]   and you know that it benefits them
[01:32:58.660 --> 01:33:01.060]   to have more people more quickly on the internet.
[01:33:01.060 --> 01:33:03.340]   There's still, I don't know, is it 22% of the country
[01:33:03.340 --> 01:33:05.940]   that still doesn't have broadband access?
[01:33:05.940 --> 01:33:07.820]   This seems to me like a Google problem.
[01:33:07.820 --> 01:33:09.940]   Something that you, what's that?
[01:33:09.940 --> 01:33:11.020]   >> Wouldn't the real,
[01:33:11.020 --> 01:33:14.300]   wouldn't the top 20 markets be the place
[01:33:14.300 --> 01:33:15.980]   that you could put a lot of pressure on them?
[01:33:15.980 --> 01:33:19.780]   You could put a lot of pressure on the top 20, top 100 markets
[01:33:19.780 --> 01:33:21.060]   where you could put a lot of pressure
[01:33:21.060 --> 01:33:23.180]   because that's where everyone's making their money.
[01:33:23.180 --> 01:33:26.260]   You know, and there's typically a lot of bad service.
[01:33:26.260 --> 01:33:28.740]   You know, the service that we get in San Francisco,
[01:33:28.740 --> 01:33:31.580]   where we used to get in San Francisco until I moved,
[01:33:31.580 --> 01:33:35.060]   you know, is just horrible.
[01:33:35.060 --> 01:33:36.100]   And now some of that has to,
[01:33:36.100 --> 01:33:37.740]   I think some of that requires some legal battles,
[01:33:37.740 --> 01:33:39.380]   but if you started really saying,
[01:33:39.380 --> 01:33:41.740]   this is what it's going to look like in these big markets,
[01:33:41.740 --> 01:33:43.100]   it would force a lot of these companies
[01:33:43.100 --> 01:33:44.380]   to go to backtrack, I think,
[01:33:44.380 --> 01:33:46.180]   because everyone would jump on.
[01:33:46.180 --> 01:33:47.020]   I would jump on.
[01:33:47.020 --> 01:33:48.140]   Like if Google came in here and said,
[01:33:48.140 --> 01:33:49.900]   "Gigabit, Ethernet."
[01:33:49.900 --> 01:33:50.740]   >> Oh, I do it.
[01:33:50.740 --> 01:33:54.140]   >> "Gigabit connection for $200 a month or $150 a month."
[01:33:54.140 --> 01:33:55.500]   No cabs.
[01:33:55.500 --> 01:33:56.340]   You know, you can--
[01:33:56.340 --> 01:33:58.620]   >> The problem is that then they would be a monopoly.
[01:33:58.620 --> 01:34:00.380]   So because nobody would compete with that.
[01:34:00.380 --> 01:34:02.860]   >> And that's the problem is that all this infrastructure
[01:34:02.860 --> 01:34:03.700]   is so expensive.
[01:34:03.700 --> 01:34:05.340]   So they have to put fiber in to make that work.
[01:34:05.340 --> 01:34:06.940]   And that's very expensive for a subscriber.
[01:34:06.940 --> 01:34:08.340]   Here's my suggestion.
[01:34:08.340 --> 01:34:10.460]   And I don't, this isn't my idea.
[01:34:10.460 --> 01:34:12.980]   This is an idea that Bob Frankston came up with.
[01:34:12.980 --> 01:34:16.020]   We had Tim Poser on triangulation last week.
[01:34:16.020 --> 01:34:19.900]   The cities should treat the wiring
[01:34:19.900 --> 01:34:21.820]   for internet broadband as infrastructure,
[01:34:21.820 --> 01:34:25.020]   just as they do water and sewer.
[01:34:25.020 --> 01:34:27.500]   Put that in and then say compete.
[01:34:27.500 --> 01:34:28.940]   >> We will do the infrastructure now.
[01:34:28.940 --> 01:34:31.380]   Let's have 100 ISPs trying to provide the best service.
[01:34:31.380 --> 01:34:32.220]   >> You know who's doing that?
[01:34:32.220 --> 01:34:33.060]   >> Who?
[01:34:33.060 --> 01:34:34.420]   >> I hate to bring this up because I always bring it.
[01:34:34.420 --> 01:34:35.260]   We're Wanda.
[01:34:35.260 --> 01:34:37.460]   So we're Wanda owns all the fiber going through.
[01:34:37.460 --> 01:34:39.300]   They are running fibers to every city.
[01:34:39.300 --> 01:34:41.860]   They're all the fiber coming in and all the fiber going around.
[01:34:41.860 --> 01:34:44.260]   They have tons of extra dark fiber that's there.
[01:34:44.260 --> 01:34:47.020]   They do everything up to the last mile.
[01:34:47.020 --> 01:34:49.020]   And then they say, okay, now all of the cell providers
[01:34:49.020 --> 01:34:51.420]   and all the internet providers get to plug into this fiber
[01:34:51.420 --> 01:34:53.180]   backbone.
[01:34:53.180 --> 01:34:54.660]   And it was done correctly.
[01:34:54.660 --> 01:34:55.820]   It's done by one.
[01:34:55.820 --> 01:34:59.780]   But the government also says this is the amount you're allowed
[01:34:59.780 --> 01:35:02.620]   to charge over what we're charging you for your service.
[01:35:02.620 --> 01:35:03.900]   Now you can add other services to that.
[01:35:03.900 --> 01:35:04.900]   >> I don't think they should do that.
[01:35:04.900 --> 01:35:07.380]   I think they should just say, hey, you charge whatever you want.
[01:35:07.380 --> 01:35:09.660]   If there's competition, the price will find
[01:35:09.660 --> 01:35:11.260]   it's a natural recipe.
[01:35:11.260 --> 01:35:13.500]   The reason you do this though is it really is infrastructure.
[01:35:13.500 --> 01:35:14.500]   And you don't want the government
[01:35:14.500 --> 01:35:17.500]   in the internet service business because then they control
[01:35:17.500 --> 01:35:19.300]   the channels here.
[01:35:19.300 --> 01:35:20.380]   But it's infrastructure.
[01:35:20.380 --> 01:35:22.020]   And I don't think you want the federal government doing it
[01:35:22.020 --> 01:35:22.860]   either.
[01:35:22.860 --> 01:35:24.420]   I think you want a lot of small municipal governments doing it.
[01:35:24.420 --> 01:35:25.300]   But that's just the problem.
[01:35:25.300 --> 01:35:29.420]   >> Well, the problem is that in these ISPs saw this happening.
[01:35:29.420 --> 01:35:32.260]   And so some cities started getting into this business.
[01:35:32.260 --> 01:35:35.860]   And the ISPs immediately came in and got laws passed.
[01:35:35.860 --> 01:35:38.420]   So like in Pennsylvania, the government's not allowed to
[01:35:38.420 --> 01:35:41.260]   not allowed to even lay the fire.
[01:35:41.260 --> 01:35:44.340]   >> You can thank Comcast and Verizon for that because they
[01:35:44.340 --> 01:35:45.500]   just didn't want the competition.
[01:35:45.500 --> 01:35:52.220]   Delicious sold by from Yahoo to Chad, Herley, and Steve Chen.
[01:35:52.220 --> 01:35:53.620]   I think they did this.
[01:35:53.620 --> 01:35:55.180]   It was a couple of million.
[01:35:55.180 --> 01:35:58.180]   I think it was a charitable donation to the internet.
[01:35:58.180 --> 01:36:00.660]   I think they said, yeah, delicious should be kept around.
[01:36:00.660 --> 01:36:02.020]   Well, it costs us nothing.
[01:36:02.020 --> 01:36:03.540]   We'll just throw a couple of little money.
[01:36:03.540 --> 01:36:04.580]   We got some money from that.
[01:36:04.580 --> 01:36:06.300]   We got a few billion from Google.
[01:36:06.300 --> 01:36:09.020]   >> Did they actually, I had the sense when I saw that
[01:36:09.020 --> 01:36:11.300]   that they released the terms?
[01:36:11.300 --> 01:36:12.140]   >> No, they didn't.
[01:36:12.140 --> 01:36:14.700]   But I do remember Yahoo saying, hey, we'll sell it for two million.
[01:36:14.700 --> 01:36:18.980]   >> I had the, I had the, you pressed less than that.
[01:36:18.980 --> 01:36:20.340]   >> You think it was like a hundred thousand?
[01:36:20.340 --> 01:36:22.780]   >> I think it was, we will take over the cost of running it.
[01:36:22.780 --> 01:36:23.620]   >> That might be.
[01:36:23.620 --> 01:36:24.780]   That was, I think that was the.
[01:36:24.780 --> 01:36:26.420]   >> Take it off your hands.
[01:36:26.420 --> 01:36:29.060]   >> Did you guys still use insurance?
[01:36:29.060 --> 01:36:31.420]   >> You know, I, once, when they made all that noise
[01:36:31.420 --> 01:36:35.380]   about going out of business, I changed over to a delicious
[01:36:35.380 --> 01:36:38.140]   API compatible site called Pinboard.
[01:36:38.140 --> 01:36:40.020]   What do you use Clayton?
[01:36:40.020 --> 01:36:42.580]   >> You know, I end up using, I find that I'm using Instapaper
[01:36:42.580 --> 01:36:43.420]   more and more.
[01:36:43.420 --> 01:36:44.740]   >> Well, I love that.
[01:36:44.740 --> 01:36:45.740]   >> But I don't use it.
[01:36:45.740 --> 01:36:51.100]   I think I'm using it, obviously to read content.
[01:36:51.100 --> 01:36:52.820]   But I'm also saving stories there
[01:36:52.820 --> 01:36:54.020]   that I just want to remember.
[01:36:54.020 --> 01:36:55.020]   And I'm, you know, now I'm here.
[01:36:55.020 --> 01:36:56.580]   >> So here's my, I'll give a plug for Pinboard
[01:36:56.580 --> 01:36:57.740]   and why I like Pinboard.
[01:36:57.740 --> 01:36:59.820]   It's not free, by the way, you have to buy it.
[01:36:59.820 --> 01:37:01.340]   But that's one of the reasons I like it
[01:37:01.340 --> 01:37:04.980]   because they have a financial model that makes sense, right?
[01:37:04.980 --> 01:37:08.380]   You know, and we use it to bookmark all our stories.
[01:37:08.380 --> 01:37:12.140]   So Pinboard follows the delicious API,
[01:37:12.140 --> 01:37:13.380]   but it adds some features.
[01:37:13.380 --> 01:37:15.900]   Yahoo never added anything to delicious.
[01:37:15.900 --> 01:37:17.500]   They just let it lie fallow.
[01:37:17.500 --> 01:37:19.780]   But for instance, it will follow a Twitter account.
[01:37:19.780 --> 01:37:21.100]   So I have a special Twitter account,
[01:37:21.100 --> 01:37:24.060]   links underscore four underscore Twit.
[01:37:24.060 --> 01:37:26.820]   And anytime I tweet a story there,
[01:37:26.820 --> 01:37:29.380]   it automatically goes into the bookmarks there.
[01:37:29.380 --> 01:37:31.180]   I can add a hashtag if I want.
[01:37:31.180 --> 01:37:33.980]   So then when I lean, our producer sits down and says,
[01:37:33.980 --> 01:37:35.100]   what are we going to talk about?
[01:37:35.100 --> 01:37:36.420]   All the stories we've talked about
[01:37:36.420 --> 01:37:39.460]   have been tagged by me and others into our Pinboard account.
[01:37:39.460 --> 01:37:42.340]   Then she can go through it, which makes it, you know,
[01:37:42.340 --> 01:37:44.100]   really easy.
[01:37:44.100 --> 01:37:45.940]   It does do what you want to do, Clayton,
[01:37:45.940 --> 01:37:48.940]   which is for a, I think $25 a year,
[01:37:48.940 --> 01:37:51.740]   you could say, I want you to capture this entire page,
[01:37:51.740 --> 01:37:54.820]   save it, cache it, have it locally for me.
[01:37:54.820 --> 01:37:56.380]   So it has that feature.
[01:37:56.380 --> 01:37:57.820]   So you don't have to read these pages.
[01:37:57.820 --> 01:37:59.780]   You save them forever though.
[01:37:59.780 --> 01:38:01.580]   - There's this scattered all over the internet for me.
[01:38:01.580 --> 01:38:02.780]   I mean, if I'm going to go into a meeting
[01:38:02.780 --> 01:38:05.060]   and pitch stories for the show on the weekend
[01:38:05.060 --> 01:38:06.900]   on Fox and Friends and I've got, you know,
[01:38:06.900 --> 01:38:11.580]   I'm in this app and I can only email it to myself.
[01:38:11.580 --> 01:38:14.020]   I can't save it out too delicious somewhere
[01:38:14.020 --> 01:38:16.180]   because it's a native app on the iPad or something.
[01:38:16.180 --> 01:38:17.660]   - That's exactly what I use it for.
[01:38:17.660 --> 01:38:19.260]   You have a special Pinboard email
[01:38:19.260 --> 01:38:21.300]   so you can email it to your Pinboard.
[01:38:21.300 --> 01:38:25.140]   You also have the tweets and almost all the things
[01:38:25.140 --> 01:38:26.540]   like Flipboard and everything will support you
[01:38:26.540 --> 01:38:28.220]   tweeting something.
[01:38:28.220 --> 01:38:30.020]   - And listen to this kind of phrase.
[01:38:30.020 --> 01:38:30.860]   - I never know for this kind of thing.
[01:38:30.860 --> 01:38:31.940]   - It's great too, I love it.
[01:38:31.940 --> 01:38:35.180]   - But they don't really do social all that well.
[01:38:35.180 --> 01:38:36.900]   Because there are a lot of times I might see something
[01:38:36.900 --> 01:38:39.940]   and make a note and want to share it just with Clayton.
[01:38:39.940 --> 01:38:42.300]   And you know, you'd have to either send the whole thing
[01:38:42.300 --> 01:38:43.700]   or you can't really--
[01:38:43.700 --> 01:38:45.300]   - Didn't they just have an update though?
[01:38:45.300 --> 01:38:47.460]   Didn't they, this week they just added social.
[01:38:47.460 --> 01:38:49.660]   I was listening to the Evernote podcast by the way
[01:38:49.660 --> 01:38:52.220]   this week actually and they,
[01:38:52.220 --> 01:38:56.260]   I think they just added a big social component to Evernote.
[01:38:56.260 --> 01:38:59.020]   I have to check that.
[01:38:59.020 --> 01:39:01.820]   - I downloaded it but I don't know what's--
[01:39:01.820 --> 01:39:05.100]   - And you know, I love Evernote and I love Phil Livin.
[01:39:05.100 --> 01:39:07.020]   And I've interviewed him, I've had him on my show.
[01:39:07.020 --> 01:39:08.340]   - I think it's great.
[01:39:08.340 --> 01:39:09.180]   - And I think it's great.
[01:39:09.180 --> 01:39:11.700]   Do great stuff and the iPad app is fantastic.
[01:39:11.700 --> 01:39:14.500]   But Evernote updates every day.
[01:39:14.500 --> 01:39:17.180]   - It does, they always have an app.
[01:39:17.180 --> 01:39:18.620]   - What's wrong with that?
[01:39:18.620 --> 01:39:21.540]   - Every time I log in Evernote, I have an update.
[01:39:21.540 --> 01:39:22.380]   - That means it's getting better.
[01:39:22.380 --> 01:39:24.260]   - The desktop version is what kills me.
[01:39:24.260 --> 01:39:25.780]   It's always trying to update.
[01:39:25.780 --> 01:39:26.620]   - So look at this.
[01:39:26.620 --> 01:39:27.820]   - You know that those guys are working feverishly.
[01:39:27.820 --> 01:39:30.180]   - So this is the Twitter, links for Twitter account.
[01:39:30.180 --> 01:39:32.140]   So I follow a lot of news organizations.
[01:39:32.140 --> 01:39:35.740]   So one way that I can send something right now
[01:39:35.740 --> 01:39:39.260]   to Pinboard is just by retweeting this.
[01:39:39.260 --> 01:39:41.140]   And as soon as I retweet this,
[01:39:41.140 --> 01:39:44.180]   this is, let's say I want to retweet this,
[01:39:44.180 --> 01:39:45.900]   Nick, oh I'm not logged in so I can't.
[01:39:45.900 --> 01:39:47.340]   If I were logged in, I could retweet it.
[01:39:47.340 --> 01:39:49.820]   And then it would go right into Pinboard.
[01:39:49.820 --> 01:39:50.980]   And I can add hashtags.
[01:39:50.980 --> 01:39:51.820]   I just think it's--
[01:39:51.820 --> 01:39:53.780]   - So you don't have to search through Twitter
[01:39:53.780 --> 01:39:55.420]   to find stuff you've shared before.
[01:39:55.420 --> 01:39:57.060]   You don't have to search through Instagram.
[01:39:57.060 --> 01:39:58.460]   - Instapaper to say it's all right there.
[01:39:58.460 --> 01:39:59.300]   - It's all right here.
[01:39:59.300 --> 01:40:02.100]   And then see, Pinboard just adds it as something it saw
[01:40:02.100 --> 01:40:04.220]   on Twitter on the Twitter account.
[01:40:04.220 --> 01:40:06.860]   Let me see if I can find, yeah, it says from Twitter, see?
[01:40:06.860 --> 01:40:09.140]   So that means it was from the Twitter account.
[01:40:09.140 --> 01:40:11.980]   And I used hashtags 299, that's episode
[01:40:11.980 --> 01:40:12.940]   two nine eight windows weekly.
[01:40:12.940 --> 01:40:15.220]   And that's so that way it pulls it right in.
[01:40:15.220 --> 01:40:17.900]   And it's just a retweet, but I have the article now.
[01:40:17.900 --> 01:40:18.740]   - I like that.
[01:40:18.740 --> 01:40:20.340]   - And listen, this is really great.
[01:40:20.340 --> 01:40:22.660]   And listen to this high praise from Leo LaPorte
[01:40:22.660 --> 01:40:25.140]   this week in tech on the front page of Pinboard.
[01:40:25.140 --> 01:40:27.500]   - I do not own stock, I do not get any money there,
[01:40:27.500 --> 01:40:29.100]   not an advertiser.
[01:40:29.100 --> 01:40:31.820]   - No, no, no, no, it's a great quote though.
[01:40:31.820 --> 01:40:33.020]   What delicious could have been
[01:40:33.020 --> 01:40:34.820]   if Yahoo hadn't neglected it?
[01:40:34.820 --> 01:40:37.620]   - Well, one of the founders is a former deliciouser.
[01:40:37.620 --> 01:40:38.460]   - Yeah.
[01:40:38.460 --> 01:40:41.660]   - So if that's a word, Yahoo did totally neglected.
[01:40:41.660 --> 01:40:42.500]   And it's very simple.
[01:40:42.500 --> 01:40:43.340]   - I'm gonna check this out, that's really--
[01:40:43.340 --> 01:40:45.180]   - It's just my little plug for them.
[01:40:45.180 --> 01:40:48.260]   Facebook, some stories, they launched social deals,
[01:40:48.260 --> 01:40:50.500]   deals to challenge Groupon.
[01:40:50.500 --> 01:40:52.380]   If you log on to your Facebook account in certain cities,
[01:40:52.380 --> 01:40:53.500]   including the Bay Area.
[01:40:53.500 --> 01:40:54.940]   - You guys use Groupon?
[01:40:54.940 --> 01:40:56.920]   - No, I bet Natalie does.
[01:40:56.920 --> 01:41:01.580]   - I, you know, mostly it just annoys me with emails every day
[01:41:01.580 --> 01:41:03.780]   'cause it's never, I don't need a bikini wax.
[01:41:03.780 --> 01:41:07.020]   You know, like it's always weird things that like,
[01:41:07.020 --> 01:41:08.020]   I don't know exactly--
[01:41:08.020 --> 01:41:09.860]   - And do you wanna respond to that?
[01:41:09.860 --> 01:41:11.420]   - I was gonna say I second that.
[01:41:11.420 --> 01:41:13.740]   - I mean, that was usually a wait a second.
[01:41:13.740 --> 01:41:14.820]   (laughing)
[01:41:14.820 --> 01:41:16.820]   - It has the weirdest things.
[01:41:16.820 --> 01:41:17.980]   You know, I don't--
[01:41:17.980 --> 01:41:19.740]   - No, I agree with you, it's always kind of stuff
[01:41:19.740 --> 01:41:21.380]   you don't want and it's not that much off.
[01:41:21.380 --> 01:41:23.060]   - Facebook deals are actually,
[01:41:23.060 --> 01:41:25.300]   oh, you are you a Groupon user?
[01:41:25.300 --> 01:41:26.700]   - Yeah.
[01:41:26.700 --> 01:41:28.340]   I find, I mean, maybe it's 'cause--
[01:41:28.340 --> 01:41:30.420]   - You're in has a decent stuff.
[01:41:30.420 --> 01:41:31.260]   - Yeah, it's just--
[01:41:31.260 --> 01:41:34.100]   - But yeah, we get quite good stuff.
[01:41:34.100 --> 01:41:35.900]   There was a deal that I got through the day,
[01:41:35.900 --> 01:41:40.900]   which was like a weekend rental of an Audi R8.
[01:41:41.900 --> 01:41:43.780]   - For how much?
[01:41:43.780 --> 01:41:47.580]   - It's like 550 pounds.
[01:41:47.580 --> 01:41:49.580]   - That's a lot of money, but I guess that's a bit of a deal.
[01:41:49.580 --> 01:41:51.500]   - But it's like really cheap to rent an Audi R8.
[01:41:51.500 --> 01:41:53.420]   - I like to rent an Audi R8.
[01:41:53.420 --> 01:41:55.460]   - But it sort of forces you into things you wouldn't do.
[01:41:55.460 --> 01:41:57.860]   You're like, yeah, I'm gonna get an Audi this weekend.
[01:41:57.860 --> 01:41:58.700]   - That's the point.
[01:41:58.700 --> 01:42:00.700]   - Yeah, I have a person.
[01:42:00.700 --> 01:42:02.700]   - I wouldn't normally do that, but because Groupon's--
[01:42:02.700 --> 01:42:05.100]   - Yeah, but you kind of sign up so that you can just,
[01:42:05.100 --> 01:42:07.740]   you can get lunch deals, like you get, you know,
[01:42:07.740 --> 01:42:10.260]   half off your burrito and maybe you wouldn't have otherwise
[01:42:10.260 --> 01:42:14.020]   got a burrito, but these are like microderm of abrasion
[01:42:14.020 --> 01:42:16.700]   or I mean I'm a minor gender-specific, but--
[01:42:16.700 --> 01:42:18.060]   - I have to say the one that the woman does get.
[01:42:18.060 --> 01:42:19.380]   - Did you need an Audi that weekend?
[01:42:19.380 --> 01:42:21.780]   - Yeah, see my problem is maybe where I live.
[01:42:21.780 --> 01:42:22.940]   I think it might be very specific.
[01:42:22.940 --> 01:42:27.940]   So look what I get in Petaluma, $10 for $20 worth
[01:42:27.940 --> 01:42:33.500]   of fine American fare and drinks and a $10 match play credit
[01:42:33.500 --> 01:42:35.620]   at the 101 casino.
[01:42:35.620 --> 01:42:39.860]   So basically I'm getting a burger for 10 bucks off.
[01:42:39.860 --> 01:42:41.020]   - That just doesn't appeal to me.
[01:42:41.020 --> 01:42:42.060]   - That's pretty cool.
[01:42:42.060 --> 01:42:42.900]   That is pretty cool.
[01:42:42.900 --> 01:42:44.220]   - That's kind of sucky.
[01:42:44.220 --> 01:42:47.540]   - 15, I mean, aren't burgers usually $4?
[01:42:47.540 --> 01:42:49.500]   So if $10 off the burger, it should,
[01:42:49.500 --> 01:42:51.420]   they should be sending you $4 in the mail.
[01:42:51.420 --> 01:42:54.820]   - Look, would you like $30 worth of spices, teas and oil?
[01:42:54.820 --> 01:42:57.220]   - Well, you can get it for just 15 bucks.
[01:42:57.220 --> 01:42:58.740]   - Well, I don't understand why, is there,
[01:42:58.740 --> 01:43:01.780]   is there not a, I don't quite understand why it's all local.
[01:43:01.780 --> 01:43:02.620]   I mean, I understand Groupon is local.
[01:43:02.620 --> 01:43:03.540]   - Well, that's the whole deal.
[01:43:03.540 --> 01:43:04.940]   - But I know I understand that Groupon's all local,
[01:43:04.940 --> 01:43:07.140]   but I don't understand why someone hasn't created one of these
[01:43:07.140 --> 01:43:10.300]   that sends us much more national around the internet.
[01:43:10.300 --> 01:43:12.940]   'Cause I'm not, yeah, I'm not that interested in that.
[01:43:12.940 --> 01:43:14.220]   - Do you not have national ones?
[01:43:14.220 --> 01:43:16.300]   'Cause we have national Groupons.
[01:43:16.300 --> 01:43:18.500]   So you can get like a whole UK wide one.
[01:43:18.500 --> 01:43:20.620]   - That's 'cause England's such a little island.
[01:43:20.620 --> 01:43:22.260]   - Yeah, we might as well be statewide.
[01:43:22.260 --> 01:43:23.100]   - Yeah.
[01:43:23.100 --> 01:43:24.100]   - Everything's local there.
[01:43:24.100 --> 01:43:25.100]   (laughing)
[01:43:25.100 --> 01:43:25.940]   - Oh!
[01:43:25.940 --> 01:43:32.660]   Facebook has also launched a send button.
[01:43:32.660 --> 01:43:34.140]   This is gonna take over the internet,
[01:43:34.140 --> 01:43:38.060]   just like the like button, where you can use the send button
[01:43:38.060 --> 01:43:40.220]   to send an article to somebody on Facebook.
[01:43:40.220 --> 01:43:42.380]   And I'm sure every website now is using it.
[01:43:42.380 --> 01:43:44.940]   And--
[01:43:44.940 --> 01:43:45.940]   - Now, are you gonna add that stuff?
[01:43:45.940 --> 01:43:47.740]   I know you were talking about that a few weeks ago.
[01:43:47.740 --> 01:43:48.820]   - I first said no.
[01:43:48.820 --> 01:43:50.780]   I said never, I don't wanna support these guys,
[01:43:50.780 --> 01:43:51.620]   but you know what?
[01:43:51.620 --> 01:43:54.020]   It's a huge price you pay by not doing it.
[01:43:54.020 --> 01:43:57.260]   - Yeah, to not have the like button on the website.
[01:43:57.260 --> 01:43:58.660]   - You better believe we'll have it.
[01:43:58.660 --> 01:44:00.500]   You better believe we'll have it, of course we will.
[01:44:00.500 --> 01:44:01.820]   We're redesigning the site right now.
[01:44:01.820 --> 01:44:03.940]   That's the first thing we'll do.
[01:44:03.940 --> 01:44:06.580]   I hate to say it, but you're missing so much traffic
[01:44:06.580 --> 01:44:07.820]   if you don't.
[01:44:07.820 --> 01:44:09.180]   - Yeah.
[01:44:09.180 --> 01:44:10.260]   It's just foolish.
[01:44:10.260 --> 01:44:14.860]   - There's a new attack that you can make,
[01:44:14.860 --> 01:44:16.300]   it's probably fixed by now.
[01:44:16.300 --> 01:44:21.340]   Just send an email to Facebook,
[01:44:21.340 --> 01:44:24.960]   and they will just lock any enemy's account out right away.
[01:44:24.960 --> 01:44:28.940]   - What do you have to say?
[01:44:28.940 --> 01:44:30.820]   - I'm trying to figure it out.
[01:44:30.820 --> 01:44:34.340]   Ken Fisher's writing in ARIS Technica,
[01:44:34.340 --> 01:44:36.620]   actually that's the wrong page.
[01:44:36.620 --> 01:44:39.540]   Facebook is so eager to protect copyright
[01:44:39.540 --> 01:44:41.860]   that the mere accusation of copyright infringement
[01:44:41.860 --> 01:44:43.940]   is enough to get an account locked.
[01:44:43.940 --> 01:44:47.660]   ARIS Technica, which is a really great site for tech news,
[01:44:47.660 --> 01:44:49.420]   found this out the hard way Thursday morning
[01:44:49.420 --> 01:44:52.020]   when our own Facebook page became inaccessible.
[01:44:52.020 --> 01:44:55.720]   No warning, no explanation, no clear appeal process.
[01:44:55.720 --> 01:44:59.340]   And all it said was we have removed or disabled access
[01:44:59.340 --> 01:45:02.420]   to the following content that you have posted on Facebook
[01:45:02.420 --> 01:45:04.580]   because we received a notice from a third party
[01:45:04.580 --> 01:45:05.780]   that it infringes.
[01:45:05.780 --> 01:45:11.140]   They don't say what infringes,
[01:45:11.140 --> 01:45:13.220]   and there is a link that you could find out
[01:45:13.220 --> 01:45:14.380]   for more information.
[01:45:14.380 --> 01:45:19.100]   - Yeah, so is there any real review process
[01:45:19.100 --> 01:45:20.020]   or we don't know yet?
[01:45:20.020 --> 01:45:22.540]   So you can basically just,
[01:45:22.540 --> 01:45:23.860]   if you had some enemies out there
[01:45:23.860 --> 01:45:26.900]   who wanted to send some sort of an email message
[01:45:26.900 --> 01:45:31.500]   to take down your business website, you're screwed.
[01:45:31.500 --> 01:45:32.340]   - Right.
[01:45:32.340 --> 01:45:35.500]   - At some point in time,
[01:45:35.500 --> 01:45:39.220]   it seems like the copyright law has to become so absurd
[01:45:39.220 --> 01:45:42.180]   that we just, either people just stop paying attention to it
[01:45:42.180 --> 01:45:44.260]   or they actually do a whole overhaul.
[01:45:44.260 --> 01:45:46.540]   But it is, every, I mean, it seems like half
[01:45:46.540 --> 01:45:48.940]   of the show we're talking about, all this weird stuff
[01:45:48.940 --> 01:45:51.620]   that people are, the licensing, the reason that your Apple TV
[01:45:51.620 --> 01:45:54.140]   has some stuff that your iPad doesn't,
[01:45:54.140 --> 01:45:56.780]   and the reason that it's all of this licensing
[01:45:56.780 --> 01:46:00.740]   and all these digital rights are so,
[01:46:00.740 --> 01:46:03.140]   we have a system that wasn't built for the level
[01:46:03.140 --> 01:46:04.220]   that it's being used at.
[01:46:04.220 --> 01:46:05.660]   - I gotta say, I agree with you,
[01:46:05.660 --> 01:46:07.580]   and with regards to Facebook,
[01:46:07.580 --> 01:46:10.420]   if you're using Facebook to promote yourself on the web,
[01:46:10.420 --> 01:46:12.260]   you're living in the Facebook environment,
[01:46:12.260 --> 01:46:14.700]   and that's the first mistake number one.
[01:46:14.700 --> 01:46:16.420]   So I'll put a send button on there,
[01:46:16.420 --> 01:46:19.580]   but it shouldn't be the only thing that you do.
[01:46:19.580 --> 01:46:21.140]   And I agree, I mean, I'd look at YouTube,
[01:46:21.140 --> 01:46:22.620]   you have to go to copyright school,
[01:46:22.620 --> 01:46:24.500]   I mean, we're in it, for instance,
[01:46:24.500 --> 01:46:27.380]   putting that South Park clip in the show,
[01:46:27.380 --> 01:46:29.740]   we'll almost certainly get this show taken off of YouTube
[01:46:29.740 --> 01:46:32.020]   for copyright violation, and then we have to respond.
[01:46:32.020 --> 01:46:34.460]   And then you get three strikes,
[01:46:34.460 --> 01:46:37.340]   you have to go to the YouTube copyright school.
[01:46:37.340 --> 01:46:39.620]   The pendulum is swung all the way over.
[01:46:39.620 --> 01:46:41.340]   - At least you don't have to show up anywhere.
[01:46:41.340 --> 01:46:43.660]   - Yeah, and the test is very easy, I already passed it,
[01:46:43.660 --> 01:46:45.380]   I didn't even watch the video.
[01:46:45.380 --> 01:46:47.660]   It had a pirate kitty cat on it though.
[01:46:47.660 --> 01:46:49.740]   (laughing)
[01:46:49.740 --> 01:46:51.740]   Hey, we're out of time, but I really wanna thank you guys
[01:46:51.740 --> 01:46:53.780]   for joining us, and Natalie, seriously,
[01:46:54.500 --> 01:46:57.620]   if that other job doesn't pan out.
[01:46:57.620 --> 01:46:58.460]   - Or show up.
[01:46:58.460 --> 01:47:00.620]   - Or show up, please, come on over here,
[01:47:00.620 --> 01:47:02.740]   we'd love to have you as part of our group.
[01:47:02.740 --> 01:47:05.220]   I just can't pay you or give you a job or anything like that,
[01:47:05.220 --> 01:47:07.740]   but just come on over anyway.
[01:47:07.740 --> 01:47:08.580]   - Fair enough.
[01:47:08.580 --> 01:47:10.060]   (laughing)
[01:47:10.060 --> 01:47:12.860]   Actually, I have a fantasy, you wanna know my fantasy?
[01:47:12.860 --> 01:47:14.300]   Seriously, I have a fantasy.
[01:47:14.300 --> 01:47:17.420]   I want you and Clayton to host a morning show on Twitch,
[01:47:17.420 --> 01:47:19.940]   maybe with Barretunde and some people back here,
[01:47:19.940 --> 01:47:22.580]   and just, you could bicker the whole time, it'd be great.
[01:47:22.580 --> 01:47:23.420]   I just love that.
[01:47:23.420 --> 01:47:25.660]   - It'll be us, like we do every Sunday night
[01:47:25.660 --> 01:47:28.740]   where I accuse Clayton of Clayton Apple fanboyism,
[01:47:28.740 --> 01:47:31.340]   and him accusing me of blatant Google fanboys.
[01:47:31.340 --> 01:47:34.140]   - It's a natural, come on you guys.
[01:47:34.140 --> 01:47:35.220]   - And then there's love.
[01:47:35.220 --> 01:47:36.380]   - And then there's love.
[01:47:36.380 --> 01:47:37.220]   It's love and big.
[01:47:37.220 --> 01:47:39.500]   - And then one of us, one of us has to go out and buy flowers.
[01:47:39.500 --> 01:47:41.660]   - It's really a natural format,
[01:47:41.660 --> 01:47:44.140]   every television station in America
[01:47:44.140 --> 01:47:46.180]   is at one point or another tried that.
[01:47:46.180 --> 01:47:47.020]   - Yeah.
[01:47:47.020 --> 01:47:48.500]   - She'll be the whoopee to my joy.
[01:47:48.500 --> 01:47:49.340]   - Yes.
[01:47:49.340 --> 01:47:50.780]   Whoopee, joy.
[01:47:50.780 --> 01:47:52.820]   - Can I be Hoda, and he'll be Cathy Lee.
[01:47:52.820 --> 01:47:54.660]   (laughing)
[01:47:54.660 --> 01:47:56.460]   Natalie is in Nataliemorris.com,
[01:47:56.460 --> 01:47:58.980]   N-A-T-A-L-I-M-O-R-I-S.com,
[01:47:58.980 --> 01:48:01.260]   and of course she's part of the Grizzly Network,
[01:48:01.260 --> 01:48:03.620]   so what's the name of the new Mommy Show?
[01:48:03.620 --> 01:48:04.780]   - It's Mommy Beta.
[01:48:04.780 --> 01:48:06.060]   - I love that.
[01:48:06.060 --> 01:48:07.140]   - And that's my website,
[01:48:07.140 --> 01:48:08.900]   that's our website where we blog as well.
[01:48:08.900 --> 01:48:10.940]   We give away a ton of Mommy products there too.
[01:48:10.940 --> 01:48:13.460]   You don't have to be a Mommy, you could be a daddy.
[01:48:13.460 --> 01:48:14.820]   So, mommybeta.com,
[01:48:14.820 --> 01:48:18.740]   and then Clayton in my show is called The Trending Show.
[01:48:18.740 --> 01:48:19.580]   - That's great.
[01:48:19.580 --> 01:48:21.060]   Mommybeta.com.
[01:48:22.140 --> 01:48:24.020]   Beta testing Parenthood.
[01:48:24.020 --> 01:48:25.580]   - Clayton Morris is at Fox and Friends.
[01:48:25.580 --> 01:48:26.740]   He actually has a job,
[01:48:26.740 --> 01:48:29.660]   but he's still doing some stuff on the side too,
[01:48:29.660 --> 01:48:31.860]   including a bunch of podcasts.
[01:48:31.860 --> 01:48:34.140]   - Yeah, and if you love paranormal news by the way,
[01:48:34.140 --> 01:48:35.140]   and I know a lot of people--
[01:48:35.140 --> 01:48:35.980]   - Who does?
[01:48:35.980 --> 01:48:37.660]   - Who doesn't love paranormal news?
[01:48:37.660 --> 01:48:39.700]   You gotta check out the show I do with my buddy Jim.
[01:48:39.700 --> 01:48:40.740]   We just have a lot of fun doing it.
[01:48:40.740 --> 01:48:42.580]   It's called The Paranormal Report,
[01:48:42.580 --> 01:48:44.660]   and download that on iTunes.
[01:48:44.660 --> 01:48:46.580]   And we just, it's like unsolved mysteries,
[01:48:46.580 --> 01:48:48.020]   but like in a half hour format,
[01:48:48.020 --> 01:48:50.220]   we'd run down all the UFO news,
[01:48:50.220 --> 01:48:52.700]   and Chupa Cabra craziness every week.
[01:48:52.700 --> 01:48:55.020]   So, we have a blast doing that show also.
[01:48:55.020 --> 01:48:57.420]   - Would you say that there's more paranormal stuff
[01:48:57.420 --> 01:48:59.540]   going on now than ever before?
[01:48:59.540 --> 01:49:00.380]   - Absolutely, you know,
[01:49:00.380 --> 01:49:03.820]   because I think the ubiquitous nature of like iPhones
[01:49:03.820 --> 01:49:07.540]   and flip cams, and we saw something incredible out of India
[01:49:07.540 --> 01:49:09.380]   about two weeks ago on our show,
[01:49:09.380 --> 01:49:12.500]   and it was captured from multiple locations
[01:49:12.500 --> 01:49:15.380]   in one southern area of India,
[01:49:15.380 --> 01:49:17.380]   which, you know, think about 10 years ago,
[01:49:17.380 --> 01:49:18.900]   you wouldn't have had that kind of coverage.
[01:49:18.900 --> 01:49:21.020]   And so, multiple people caught this thing on camera
[01:49:21.020 --> 01:49:22.580]   with their cell phones and stuff,
[01:49:22.580 --> 01:49:26.340]   and we put it up on, you know, and it was great.
[01:49:26.340 --> 01:49:28.460]   I mean, you know, so I think there's been more news
[01:49:28.460 --> 01:49:30.820]   because there's been more awareness about these things.
[01:49:30.820 --> 01:49:34.380]   - So, Jim's like the art bell of the internet.
[01:49:34.380 --> 01:49:35.500]   - Yeah, he absolutely is.
[01:49:35.500 --> 01:49:38.300]   I think he's a big fan of this show as well.
[01:49:38.300 --> 01:49:40.400]   So, he has a lot of great podcasts over there,
[01:49:40.400 --> 01:49:41.300]   a lot of paranormal stuff.
[01:49:41.300 --> 01:49:42.700]   So, he and I love this stuff.
[01:49:42.700 --> 01:49:44.340]   So, fun. - So, that's great.
[01:49:44.340 --> 01:49:45.140]   So, thanks for having us.
[01:49:45.140 --> 01:49:45.980]   - Clayton also has his own,
[01:49:45.980 --> 01:49:48.300]   cycleranmorris.com.
[01:49:48.300 --> 01:49:50.580]   Will is always a pleasure to see you.
[01:49:50.580 --> 01:49:54.060]   Channelflip.com, and things are just hot
[01:49:54.060 --> 01:49:56.460]   as can be at Channelflip.
[01:49:56.460 --> 01:49:57.380]   - Yeah, it's good stuff.
[01:49:57.380 --> 01:50:00.740]   So, we just launched, do you guys get a show called Top Gear?
[01:50:00.740 --> 01:50:01.940]   - Yeah, I love Top Gear.
[01:50:01.940 --> 01:50:03.220]   It's very fun. - Okay.
[01:50:03.220 --> 01:50:04.620]   So, we've just launched a new show
[01:50:04.620 --> 01:50:06.660]   that's about technology with a guy called Richard Hammond,
[01:50:06.660 --> 01:50:09.460]   who's like one of the three people presenting Top Gear.
[01:50:09.460 --> 01:50:12.540]   It's called Richard Hammond's Tech Head.
[01:50:12.540 --> 01:50:15.580]   And it's got, you guys are talking about, you know,
[01:50:15.580 --> 01:50:17.980]   we're talking about Facebook and the power of Facebook.
[01:50:17.980 --> 01:50:21.660]   We've got over 50,000 or 45,000, I think Facebook fans.
[01:50:21.660 --> 01:50:23.660]   - Yeah, so, that's the key, isn't it?
[01:50:23.660 --> 01:50:25.260]   - Which is crazy.
[01:50:25.260 --> 01:50:29.460]   So, yeah, it's a good show, I think.
[01:50:29.460 --> 01:50:31.340]   - I love what you're doing here.
[01:50:31.340 --> 01:50:34.780]   And just wishes so much success.
[01:50:34.780 --> 01:50:38.060]   It's channelflip.com.
[01:50:38.060 --> 01:50:40.580]   - And can I also get a plug-in for my Twitter?
[01:50:40.580 --> 01:50:44.060]   'Cause I'm almost over 20,000 people now.
[01:50:44.060 --> 01:50:46.820]   And I have a bet with my cousin over which one of us
[01:50:46.820 --> 01:50:49.780]   will get to 20,000 first, and I really wanna beat her.
[01:50:49.780 --> 01:50:52.580]   - And what is the bet on, what is the prize?
[01:50:52.580 --> 01:50:55.780]   - I think I probably have to take her to dinner,
[01:50:55.780 --> 01:50:58.260]   or vice versa, depending on who loses.
[01:50:58.260 --> 01:51:01.620]   - Follow Will, he's so close, he's just 1,000,
[01:51:01.620 --> 01:51:02.940]   actually less than fewer than 1,000.
[01:51:02.940 --> 01:51:06.340]   - Less than 1,000 people, I need you to take me over, 20K.
[01:51:06.340 --> 01:51:08.020]   - You can do it right now if everybody watching,
[01:51:08.020 --> 01:51:11.020]   just went to Twitter.com and follow WILHARIS.
[01:51:13.940 --> 01:51:15.580]   - Yes. - Yes.
[01:51:15.580 --> 01:51:17.420]   - Thank you for being here.
[01:51:17.420 --> 01:51:18.260]   Well, thank you, Alex.
[01:51:18.260 --> 01:51:19.340]   Lindsay for joining us.
[01:51:19.340 --> 01:51:22.180]   Alex is the head honcho at the Pixel Core,
[01:51:22.180 --> 01:51:27.340]   and will be the first person to use the new Twitch studio,
[01:51:27.340 --> 01:51:28.740]   the Brick House. - Yes.
[01:51:28.740 --> 01:51:30.660]   - 'Cause you're about ready to go.
[01:51:30.660 --> 01:51:34.020]   - We're getting there, we just upgraded the electrical,
[01:51:34.020 --> 01:51:35.180]   we finished the green screen,
[01:51:35.180 --> 01:51:37.700]   well, we get to finish painting the green screen psych.
[01:51:37.700 --> 01:51:40.220]   But all the gear is getting moved in next week.
[01:51:40.220 --> 01:51:42.220]   And, but I don't think we're really gonna be
[01:51:42.220 --> 01:51:43.620]   fully operational until you are.
[01:51:43.620 --> 01:51:44.780]   - We're roughly the same time.
[01:51:44.780 --> 01:51:46.340]   - Yeah, I think I thought I was gonna be way ahead.
[01:51:46.340 --> 01:51:47.300]   - We're doing this fundraiser.
[01:51:47.300 --> 01:51:48.500]   We haven't started it yet, but we are.
[01:51:48.500 --> 01:51:50.180]   Everybody asks me so I just wanna say,
[01:51:50.180 --> 01:51:51.820]   we're gonna have a brick fundraiser.
[01:51:51.820 --> 01:51:53.380]   So you sell these little bricks
[01:51:53.380 --> 01:51:55.140]   and you can put anything you want on 'em.
[01:51:55.140 --> 01:51:57.260]   We haven't decided on a price yet, just watch.
[01:51:57.260 --> 01:51:59.060]   It'll probably launch this week sometime.
[01:51:59.060 --> 01:52:00.580]   We'll certainly talk about it next week.
[01:52:00.580 --> 01:52:02.700]   And the idea is to raise some money.
[01:52:02.700 --> 01:52:05.180]   We're not a charity, I'm not implying that in any way,
[01:52:05.180 --> 01:52:08.660]   you get any benefit, there's no tax benefit.
[01:52:08.660 --> 01:52:11.660]   You don't have, you won't feel good about yourself.
[01:52:11.660 --> 01:52:12.500]   - You'll feel worse.
[01:52:12.500 --> 01:52:14.220]   - You'll probably feel worse in all likely.
[01:52:14.220 --> 01:52:15.220]   - You feel a little dirty.
[01:52:15.220 --> 01:52:16.380]   - Yeah, but.
[01:52:16.380 --> 01:52:18.700]   - Are those kiln dried bricks?
[01:52:18.700 --> 01:52:21.180]   - Why, is that a hazard?
[01:52:21.180 --> 01:52:22.020]   - I have no idea.
[01:52:22.020 --> 01:52:23.980]   - Those bricks are the.
[01:52:23.980 --> 01:52:25.460]   - Is it a hazard?
[01:52:25.460 --> 01:52:27.460]   - Kiln dried?
[01:52:27.460 --> 01:52:30.500]   Probably they are, but you could put your twiddle handle
[01:52:30.500 --> 01:52:31.780]   on there, Will Harris or whatever,
[01:52:31.780 --> 01:52:33.060]   and we'll put that in the wall there.
[01:52:33.060 --> 01:52:35.300]   It's right when you enter the new Twit Brickhouse.
[01:52:35.300 --> 01:52:38.500]   - Oh, you got marble ones too?
[01:52:38.500 --> 01:52:39.340]   - Do we have any kind of--
[01:52:39.340 --> 01:52:40.180]   - We have any kind of--
[01:52:40.180 --> 01:52:41.020]   - What do you think?
[01:52:41.020 --> 01:52:42.340]   - No, the marble ones are just--
[01:52:42.340 --> 01:52:44.460]   - Can you put like balls up there?
[01:52:44.460 --> 01:52:46.780]   - Somebody wanted to say, "Screw you, Mike Harrington,
[01:52:46.780 --> 01:52:48.580]   "on their brick, that would be okay."
[01:52:48.580 --> 01:52:51.220]   - I wanna get one of those.
[01:52:51.220 --> 01:52:52.140]   - Yeah, well, stay tuned.
[01:52:52.140 --> 01:52:53.220]   We don't know what we're gonna charge it,
[01:52:53.220 --> 01:52:55.900]   it just depends on how much it costs to make the bricks.
[01:52:55.900 --> 01:52:58.020]   We're also gonna do, we have an eBay auction,
[01:52:58.020 --> 01:53:00.460]   coming up, we're gonna auction off the name of My Studio,
[01:53:00.460 --> 01:53:02.540]   'cause you know, I have a studio within the bigger studio
[01:53:02.540 --> 01:53:04.220]   that's gonna be basically like this,
[01:53:04.220 --> 01:53:07.100]   and you could call it, you know, anything you want.
[01:53:07.100 --> 01:53:10.340]   Bikini wax, labs, anything you want,
[01:53:10.340 --> 01:53:11.860]   and that'll be it.
[01:53:11.860 --> 01:53:14.700]   And every time I start the day, I'll say broadcasting live
[01:53:14.700 --> 01:53:16.860]   for the Bikini wax labs, I'm Leo Laporte.
[01:53:16.860 --> 01:53:17.860]   (laughing)
[01:53:17.860 --> 01:53:18.700]   That's gotta be with--
[01:53:18.700 --> 01:53:21.420]   - Sort of like David Letterman's home office in Yahoo.
[01:53:21.420 --> 01:53:23.300]   - Yeah, that's gotta be worth some.
[01:53:23.300 --> 01:53:26.820]   So anyway, we're just gonna try to raise a little money,
[01:53:26.820 --> 01:53:28.500]   'cause it's expensive, it's almost a million dollars
[01:53:28.500 --> 01:53:30.860]   to build this new studio, so.
[01:53:30.860 --> 01:53:32.420]   If we can have a little bit,
[01:53:32.420 --> 01:53:34.220]   what are you making a face like that?
[01:53:34.220 --> 01:53:35.140]   (laughing)
[01:53:35.140 --> 01:53:36.220]   - Yeah.
[01:53:36.220 --> 01:53:38.020]   - It's a pricey endeavor.
[01:53:38.020 --> 01:53:39.580]   - It's gonna be so awesome.
[01:53:39.580 --> 01:53:40.420]   - It's gonna be sweet.
[01:53:40.420 --> 01:53:44.260]   - It's cool, and I'm just walking through the rubble
[01:53:44.260 --> 01:53:45.100]   at the moment.
[01:53:45.100 --> 01:53:45.940]   You know, while they're putting stuff up,
[01:53:45.940 --> 01:53:46.780]   and I'm like, oh.
[01:53:46.780 --> 01:53:47.860]   - Because you're worth it.
[01:53:47.860 --> 01:53:48.940]   - Yeah.
[01:53:48.940 --> 01:53:50.260]   Hey, thank you, everybody, for being here.
[01:53:50.260 --> 01:53:51.660]   I had a great time, I hope you did too,
[01:53:51.660 --> 01:53:53.260]   and don't forget, we do this show every Sunday,
[01:53:53.260 --> 01:53:57.420]   3PM Pacific, 6PM, Eastern, at live.twit.tv,
[01:53:57.420 --> 01:53:58.900]   but we've got a lot of shows all week long,
[01:53:58.900 --> 01:54:00.260]   and of course, if you miss any one of them,
[01:54:00.260 --> 01:54:02.500]   we tevle them for you audio and video.
[01:54:02.500 --> 01:54:05.180]   Just go to twit.tv and download a copy,
[01:54:05.180 --> 01:54:08.100]   or visit it on iTunes and everywhere else.
[01:54:08.100 --> 01:54:10.580]   - I think that, I think we stopped doing
[01:54:10.580 --> 01:54:11.620]   East Meets West.
[01:54:11.620 --> 01:54:12.460]   - Yeah.
[01:54:12.460 --> 01:54:14.260]   - 'Cause Tom and Roger decided
[01:54:14.260 --> 01:54:16.460]   they didn't like getting all dressed up on a Sunday evening,
[01:54:16.460 --> 01:54:18.340]   so we will not be going.
[01:54:18.340 --> 01:54:19.900]   - Screwing up the barbecue on East Meets West,
[01:54:19.900 --> 01:54:21.780]   but I think we were gonna put something here.
[01:54:21.780 --> 01:54:23.460]   We have, Tom wants to do a gaming show.
[01:54:23.460 --> 01:54:24.700]   Oh, I gotta tell you all about this.
[01:54:24.700 --> 01:54:25.980]   You'll all be interested in this.
[01:54:25.980 --> 01:54:28.260]   We're thinking, once the new studio opens,
[01:54:28.260 --> 01:54:29.540]   we're gonna design the new studio
[01:54:29.540 --> 01:54:30.540]   so that one of the things we can do
[01:54:30.540 --> 01:54:32.620]   is have a LAN party in there,
[01:54:32.620 --> 01:54:34.660]   and but you can play on the internet,
[01:54:34.660 --> 01:54:37.100]   or in person, and we'll have great guests up there,
[01:54:37.100 --> 01:54:39.540]   and every Friday evening after the gaming show,
[01:54:39.540 --> 01:54:41.060]   LAN party, so that's gonna be--
[01:54:41.060 --> 01:54:42.180]   - Oh, that's great.
[01:54:42.180 --> 01:54:43.260]   - I know you guys will wanna do that.
[01:54:43.260 --> 01:54:45.900]   When you guys come out, you can visit and play in the LAN.
[01:54:45.900 --> 01:54:48.580]   - Yeah, excuse not to shower for three straight days.
[01:54:48.580 --> 01:54:49.900]   - I'm awesome there.
[01:54:49.900 --> 01:54:50.740]   - It's weird to bend.
[01:54:50.740 --> 01:54:52.620]   - When I come in Saturday morning to do the radio show,
[01:54:52.620 --> 01:54:53.860]   if there's still people playing,
[01:54:53.860 --> 01:54:55.740]   I'll know we've done our job.
[01:54:55.740 --> 01:54:56.580]   - Right.
[01:54:56.580 --> 01:54:57.580]   (laughing)
[01:54:57.580 --> 01:54:58.820]   - Thanks everybody for being here.
[01:54:58.820 --> 01:55:01.420]   So great, great to see you Natalie and Clayton.
[01:55:01.420 --> 01:55:03.140]   And Natalie, we just wish you all the best.
[01:55:03.140 --> 01:55:05.900]   I think your move is very exciting.
[01:55:05.900 --> 01:55:06.740]   - Thank you.
[01:55:06.740 --> 01:55:08.300]   - Yeah, it's gonna be really--
[01:55:08.300 --> 01:55:09.220]   - Yeah, we're really excited.
[01:55:09.220 --> 01:55:10.500]   - Unemployment, you know.
[01:55:10.500 --> 01:55:11.940]   - There's nothing like it.
[01:55:11.940 --> 01:55:14.460]   No, do not be afraid.
[01:55:14.460 --> 01:55:16.460]   - I'm actually not, I'm not.
[01:55:16.460 --> 01:55:17.780]   - I could tell.
[01:55:17.780 --> 01:55:22.420]   - I think that the unknown is always an exciting thing.
[01:55:22.420 --> 01:55:25.940]   - And I honor the fact that you probably wanna spend
[01:55:25.940 --> 01:55:28.020]   a little more time with that adorable little bundle
[01:55:28.020 --> 01:55:30.340]   of joy you got there, and God knows Clayton needs
[01:55:30.340 --> 01:55:31.740]   the attention, so.
[01:55:31.740 --> 01:55:34.700]   - Yeah, I have an adorable big bundle of joy
[01:55:34.700 --> 01:55:36.260]   who needs some attention to.
[01:55:36.260 --> 01:55:37.100]   (laughing)
[01:55:37.100 --> 01:55:39.140]   - Thanks for joining us, and we'll see you next week.
[01:55:39.140 --> 01:55:39.980]   Another twist.
[01:55:39.980 --> 01:55:40.820]   - It's amazing.
[01:55:40.820 --> 01:55:43.400]   (upbeat music)
[01:55:43.400 --> 01:55:45.980]   (upbeat music)
[01:55:45.980 --> 01:55:48.560]   (upbeat music)
[01:55:48.560 --> 01:55:51.460]   - All right, do it next win, baby.
