[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:01.440]   Hello everybody.
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:04.000]   Welcome to our live studio audience and all of you at home.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.160]   The show where we talk about the week's Tech news and there's a lot of news to talk about.
[00:02:08.160 --> 00:02:11.200]   Let's say hello to our panel.
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:15.280]   Liz Gans, now Liz, do I say recode now?
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.280]   That's the official name.
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.200]   Yeah, you don't have to pronounce the slash silent.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:21.200]   We slash code.
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:26.160]   No, you don't have to say that.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:27.680]   We love Liz Gans.
[00:02:27.680 --> 00:02:31.520]   She, of course, a long time feature all things digital.
[00:02:31.520 --> 00:02:36.560]   When all things do recast itself into recode, you went along for the ride.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:38.520]   Yeah, all of us did, actually.
[00:02:38.520 --> 00:02:39.520]   Yeah.
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.040]   That says a lot, frankly.
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.000]   Yeah, it's actually pretty awesome.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.320]   We're still in the same place doing kind of the same thing, but we're bigger and better
[00:02:47.320 --> 00:02:48.440]   and better and all that.
[00:02:48.440 --> 00:02:53.080]   We have hired, I think it's nine or 10 people since January.
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.240]   So we're going through kind of a crazy growth.
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.160]   But all everyone who was there before is still there.
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:04.720]   Ena Fried, who's wonderful and John Tachowski, Patrick Oskie, and the whole group, Peter
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.720]   Kafka.
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.720]   Even know how to pronounce the name.
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:08.680]   Tachowski, yeah, care of course.
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:11.240]   But I got to ask you a question and you don't have to answer this.
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:12.640]   I don't see a lot of Walt.
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.640]   Is he semi-retired?
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.240]   No, I'll still there.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.240]   Okay.
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:18.840]   I'll tell him he said that.
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.800]   I said, tell him, tell Walt.
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:22.000]   You got to write more.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.560]   You got to get busy.
[00:03:23.560 --> 00:03:24.560]   I agree.
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:25.720]   I'd love to see his stuff more.
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:27.960]   Now he's not restricted by the weekly column.
[00:03:27.960 --> 00:03:28.960]   Right.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:29.960]   So he should write all the...
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:30.960]   I feel like he's just kind of...
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.600]   Yeah, he says he's going to tell us what it all means about Apple and all that.
[00:03:34.600 --> 00:03:37.240]   So look for a column on that at some point.
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:38.720]   Come on, he's taking it easy.
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:41.200]   We're talking about Walt Mossberg.
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:45.320]   You know, honestly, Walt and Kara have done a ton, a ton of stuff around the company.
[00:03:45.320 --> 00:03:47.920]   So I think it might not be obvious from the day to day, right?
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:49.920]   He's running the business is what he's doing.
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:50.920]   Yeah.
[00:03:50.920 --> 00:03:51.920]   He runs...
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:53.220]   He does business and he's the top...
[00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:55.040]   He's the main guy in all the products, theft as well.
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.680]   So everything goes through him.
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.840]   So maybe he's been less out in front, but he's very busy.
[00:03:59.840 --> 00:04:02.920]   No, and I read his review of the HTC One, which is the...
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.160]   My new phone too.
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:07.280]   And you know, but it just seems like he...
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:10.680]   Maybe it's just because he's not probably not writing any less than he did at the journal,
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.040]   but it just feels like I want to see more of him, I guess.
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:14.040]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:04:14.040 --> 00:04:15.040]   Yeah.
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:16.040]   Yeah, more Walt.
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.720]   Boy, well, boy often.
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:23.960]   Anyway, we're thrilled to have Liz on and we've got lots of Liz gains there at recode.net.
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:24.960]   Don't go to...
[00:04:24.960 --> 00:04:26.960]   I just went to recode.com.
[00:04:26.960 --> 00:04:27.960]   It's Nero.
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:28.960]   Yeah.
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:31.880]   We're sending them lots of traffic.
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:32.880]   What?
[00:04:32.880 --> 00:04:37.120]   You know, URLs don't matter anymore, right?
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:38.120]   They don't.
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.120]   Social web.
[00:04:39.120 --> 00:04:40.120]   They don't.
[00:04:40.120 --> 00:04:41.120]   It's exactly right.
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:44.880]   Oh, look who's here also from France.
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:46.280]   It's not Patrick.
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:47.800]   Patrick Bezia.
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:48.800]   It is.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:49.800]   Hey, how's it going?
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.240]   Great to give us the European angle on all this going really well.
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.800]   We had a very busy week this week.
[00:04:54.800 --> 00:05:00.520]   It kicked things off with Amazon's announcement of their new streaming TV and I only apologize.
[00:05:00.520 --> 00:05:03.440]   I'm going to mention this because...
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:05.440]   US only, right?
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:12.760]   Well, yeah, it's not available for sale in France or Europe, but I'm sure that if you
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:15.240]   order it from the US, you can't get it delivered.
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:20.840]   So Amazon's been pretty good about those things unlike other companies.
[00:05:20.840 --> 00:05:22.840]   You know, it's a MeToo product.
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:24.720]   There's nothing to get real excited about.
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:29.400]   It's quad core Android.
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:34.000]   I fix it tore it down and it's a Snapdragon 600 in there, which is not the latest greatest,
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.560]   but a nice little processor.
[00:05:35.560 --> 00:05:39.200]   It's got its dedicated GPU, which means you can game and that's the biggest difference.
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:44.320]   Netflix, Hulu plus all the usual streaming stuff.
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:46.360]   And of course, it's Amazon is on there.
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:48.040]   Amazon streaming.
[00:05:48.040 --> 00:05:49.600]   But they really pushed the gaming.
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.200]   In fact, this is a hundred bucks for the...
[00:05:52.200 --> 00:05:53.520]   It's roughly this...
[00:05:53.520 --> 00:05:57.880]   It's like an Apple TV without rounded corners because they don't want to get sued.
[00:05:57.880 --> 00:06:02.200]   And then they also sell for an additional 40 bucks, a game controller that looks just
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:07.880]   like an Xbox controller only as if somebody sat on it.
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:08.880]   Same buttons and everything.
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:09.880]   There's voice control.
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:15.200]   Oh, let's not forget in the remote, there's a microphone and you could talk to it.
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.640]   Have you played with it at all this?
[00:06:16.640 --> 00:06:21.240]   No, I'm actually really interested to see you holding it up because I hadn't seen it
[00:06:21.240 --> 00:06:22.560]   except on the demo.
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:23.560]   You know me.
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:27.320]   I bought it right away and everything.
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.480]   Did you go to the event in New York?
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.080]   No, I didn't.
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:33.040]   I actually don't know where it was.
[00:06:33.040 --> 00:06:35.880]   I had it in my head that was in Seattle, but I can't say that I know that.
[00:06:35.880 --> 00:06:36.880]   Maybe it was.
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:37.880]   I don't know.
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:38.880]   I didn't know where it was in New York.
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:41.160]   We had Peter Kafka on during our conversation with him.
[00:06:41.160 --> 00:06:42.160]   He wasn't there either.
[00:06:42.160 --> 00:06:43.160]   I said, "It's Kara there."
[00:06:43.160 --> 00:06:44.160]   He said, "No, it's Liz there.
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.160]   No."
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.920]   Maybe nobody knew where it was.
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:48.480]   Maybe that was part of the front.
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:49.480]   Seattle would make sense.
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.320]   They made a giant living room with big screen TVs and stuff.
[00:06:52.320 --> 00:06:55.000]   I think it was New York because Christina Warren was there.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.880]   So I think it was probably New York.
[00:06:56.880 --> 00:06:57.880]   You know what I'm going to do?
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:00.120]   I'm going to fire it up tonight and I'm going to watch Game of Thrones.
[00:07:00.120 --> 00:07:03.720]   Oh, no, I'm not because HBO goes not on here.
[00:07:03.720 --> 00:07:04.720]   Booze.
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:05.720]   Booze.
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.960]   You know, it's not revolutionary.
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:12.640]   It's not going to be the one that makes everyone convinced that they need a box like
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:16.400]   this, but it definitely seems like they've put a lot of work into it.
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:23.120]   And it's fairly easy to use from all reports and it's very responsive and like some of
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.760]   the others that we've seen.
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:32.640]   That voice control, that voice search element is kind of so simple that it's almost a throw
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:33.640]   away feature.
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.360]   But it is interesting.
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:40.120]   It's almost the kind of thing that you wonder why has no one else done it before?
[00:07:40.120 --> 00:07:44.440]   It's the obvious that if it works, it's cool.
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:45.440]   Others have done it.
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:49.520]   My Samsung TV has a microphone on the remote.
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:52.320]   It also does gestures.
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:56.200]   And as I'm sitting, in fact, I happened last night watching TV, everyone's in a handle
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:58.720]   point up show up on the screen and controls the camera.
[00:07:58.720 --> 00:08:00.360]   And I have to go like this.
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:01.360]   No.
[00:08:01.360 --> 00:08:02.760]   I'm actually falling.
[00:08:02.760 --> 00:08:03.760]   No.
[00:08:03.760 --> 00:08:05.880]   I thought Samsung's Smart TV too.
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:12.480]   And it's like, I think the Roku or, you know, I mean, this is basically a Roku from Amazon.
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.800]   Actually works better because it only does with the things you want it to do.
[00:08:15.800 --> 00:08:16.800]   Right?
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:18.800]   The Samsung Smart TV is like, Oh, do you want to do a workout?
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:19.800]   No.
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:20.800]   No, I'm watching TV.
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:21.800]   Stop it.
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:22.800]   Yeah.
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.440]   That's the problem with with Samsung.
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:30.000]   A lot of the time is that they had so much, so many features.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.160]   A lot of designers often say that an Apple says that as well.
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:40.320]   One of the design principles that you have to adopt is that not including a feature is
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.640]   as important as including a feature.
[00:08:42.640 --> 00:08:45.360]   And Steve Jobs said that saying no is critical.
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:46.760]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:47.760]   Yeah.
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:52.000]   And so the Amazon one seems like it's got just the right amount of stuff and presented
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.280]   the right way and working the right way.
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:59.800]   So it seems like it's a good choice if you want one of those devices.
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:03.080]   I'm not sure that it's going to convince a lot of people that don't already have the
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:07.680]   need to jump to jump the boat and get one.
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:11.160]   Of course, Google is not going to be left behind Android TV.
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:13.840]   The replacement for Google TV is rumored to be imminent.
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:19.880]   The Verge says it will be much simpler than predecessor Google TV, which I liked a lot,
[00:09:19.880 --> 00:09:21.800]   but it was a bomb.
[00:09:21.800 --> 00:09:27.400]   They have some screenshots from a leaker and it looks very similar to the Amazon Fire
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.560]   TV.
[00:09:29.560 --> 00:09:33.640]   It has, of course, it had more front and center Google stuff like Hangouts.
[00:09:33.640 --> 00:09:39.440]   It will have YouTube, which Roku does not have, although the Amazon box does.
[00:09:39.440 --> 00:09:40.440]   This is the real problem.
[00:09:40.440 --> 00:09:41.440]   The Amazon box.
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:44.040]   I can't believe you can keep all that straight.
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:45.040]   You know what?
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:46.200]   Thanks to Veronica Belmont.
[00:09:46.200 --> 00:09:51.000]   She made a spreadsheet which she no longer maintains.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:54.560]   It has been maintained by the community of set top boxes.
[00:09:54.560 --> 00:09:59.520]   I'm going to do it first before I give the URL, but it has every set top box.
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:01.840]   People have maintained this over the years.
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:07.800]   It's bit.ly/settop is the short URL.
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:09.920]   This is what everybody needs.
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:14.840]   They've already added Amazon Fire.
[00:10:14.840 --> 00:10:22.200]   You have to be the rain man to know what does what.
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:23.360]   Who has HBO Go?
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:25.000]   Who has YouTube?
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:26.440]   They all have Netflix.
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:28.320]   That's one thing you could be sure of.
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:31.520]   It's just crazy, but some of them do Netflix better than others.
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:35.760]   The Apple TV, for instance, is a winner with Netflix because Apple runs its own CDN and
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:37.440]   so the date is better on it.
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:41.520]   It's just crazy.
[00:10:41.520 --> 00:10:44.520]   Thank you, Veronica Belmont.
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:48.160]   Anyway, this does not have HBO Go, but it does have YouTube.
[00:10:48.160 --> 00:10:50.680]   The Google TV will have YouTube, but won't have...
[00:10:50.680 --> 00:10:54.040]   I don't know.
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.680]   That's the problem is there's no one device you can buy.
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:57.680]   How many...
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:01.080]   I don't know what it's like in France, Patrick, but every single device I have in the United
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:02.240]   States plays Netflix.
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:03.240]   Every single one.
[00:11:03.240 --> 00:11:04.240]   My TV does.
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:05.240]   My Xbox One does.
[00:11:05.240 --> 00:11:07.560]   By the way, the Xbox One, I can also talk to and wave at.
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:13.320]   In fact, I don't know when I wave if it's the TV or the Xbox One that's listening.
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:15.400]   Sometimes I get two hands of different...
[00:11:15.400 --> 00:11:18.760]   Yeah, well, in France, we don't have Netflix.
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:20.800]   Yeah, so you don't have to wave at that.
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:23.080]   Hopefully soon, but not yet.
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:25.080]   So that's not a problem.
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.080]   What I do...
[00:11:26.080 --> 00:11:30.640]   I'll tell you my biggest takeaway from the Amazon Fire TV is that this hardware has now
[00:11:30.640 --> 00:11:33.960]   fairly commoditized.
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:38.600]   Because Android is free and open, of course, this is not the Android with Google services.
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:43.000]   This is just the open source Android, which Amazon has customized.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.240]   It has the chips from Qualcomm are widely available and it's well understood how we integrate
[00:11:47.240 --> 00:11:49.040]   them.
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:54.080]   All of this stuff now can be made in a very high quality package at a very low cost,
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.080]   99 bucks.
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:58.000]   Easily, it's a commodity product.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:07.840]   And it just strikes me that this is just the beginning because anybody can...
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:11.720]   People come to visit us all the time with Android streaming sticks.
[00:12:11.720 --> 00:12:13.160]   Oh, yes, I have a new Android.
[00:12:13.160 --> 00:12:15.120]   I have a new Android streaming stick.
[00:12:15.120 --> 00:12:18.280]   There's a million of them.
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:23.040]   It's kind of a consolidation of the market, isn't it?
[00:12:23.040 --> 00:12:29.160]   There's been a lot of slightly more niche products for a while, but now all of the big
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:32.080]   boys want the TV.
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:40.160]   We're sort of stabilized in the mobile landscape and now all of the big boys are sort of seriously
[00:12:40.160 --> 00:12:41.880]   taking another look at the TV.
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:46.560]   And even Apple, who's probably not going to be making an actual TV, they're getting...
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:48.760]   They're graduating the Apple TV, it seems.
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:49.760]   It's not...
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:54.800]   It's a hobby, but a hobby they look like they're taking pretty seriously.
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:13:00.600]   So it wouldn't surprise me if some of the smaller players in that market start going
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:03.440]   away slowly over the next couple of years.
[00:13:03.440 --> 00:13:09.080]   I think one of the things that's going to happen is at some point, and I know Apple's
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:14.120]   negotiating hard and I'm sure will be fruitless with Comcast, at some point, one of these
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:17.440]   is going to stream live TV.
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:18.440]   One are all.
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:24.760]   Peter from Recode said it was his opinion that the content companies wouldn't give it
[00:13:24.760 --> 00:13:25.960]   to any one player.
[00:13:25.960 --> 00:13:30.960]   They're afraid of what happened with Apple, that Apple would just dominate it.
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:35.280]   So he says they're all going to get it at once.
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:39.560]   So you guys don't have IPTV at all in the US?
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:42.080]   You mean like broadcast now?
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:49.680]   Well, because yeah, in France, the triple play system, I guess, or trend started here
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:55.680]   with an ISP that was very innovative and still is actually cold free.
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:59.160]   And we actually have TV live streaming.
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:00.160]   It's not even...
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.160]   Well, yeah, I guess it is streaming.
[00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:04.320]   It's live TV going through IP services.
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:07.640]   And the thing is everyone, all of the ISPs do it now.
[00:14:07.640 --> 00:14:15.240]   So you pay for your internet connection and you have obviously internet, phone, TV, and
[00:14:15.240 --> 00:14:18.800]   sometimes you even have a package with mobile.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:22.760]   But the point is the TV services also go through the IP.
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:29.400]   Now they're relayed from on a special part of the bandwidth and they have special servers
[00:14:29.400 --> 00:14:33.960]   at each ISP so that you have consistently good quality.
[00:14:33.960 --> 00:14:38.880]   But that's something we've had for years and I'm a little bit surprised it hasn't happened.
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:39.880]   Oh, I'm not.
[00:14:39.880 --> 00:14:40.880]   Other countries.
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:46.560]   And the reason is because you have government run television and we have Comcast.
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:48.680]   Oh, it's not government.
[00:14:48.680 --> 00:14:50.320]   Well, it's a big difference.
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.320]   Hey, we're going to...
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:52.960]   We're going to table this conversation.
[00:14:52.960 --> 00:14:53.960]   I do want to get back to this.
[00:14:53.960 --> 00:14:54.960]   We will.
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.520]   Kevin Rose has joined us and I want to bring him into the conversation.
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:14:58.680]   Kevin, thank you.
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:14:59.880]   We'll just keep you for a few minutes.
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:01.560]   I know you've got things to do.
[00:15:01.560 --> 00:15:03.040]   First of all, it's great to see you again, buddy.
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:04.040]   Good to see you as well.
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.040]   Thanks for having me.
[00:15:05.040 --> 00:15:10.880]   I was so pissed off when I saw your Instagram post this morning.
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:11.880]   I couldn't believe it.
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:13.640]   This is not an April Fool's joke, right?
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:14.840]   It is not a joke.
[00:15:14.840 --> 00:15:17.520]   Unfortunately, I wish it was.
[00:15:17.520 --> 00:15:21.720]   So everybody probably knows there have been these protests in San Francisco.
[00:15:21.720 --> 00:15:26.720]   This week a protestor vomited on the Google or the Yahoo bus on it.
[00:15:26.720 --> 00:15:29.280]   Not a writer, a protestor.
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:31.680]   They've been all sorts of stuff.
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:37.760]   The feeling is, I guess, that the cost of living in San Francisco has just gone through
[00:15:37.760 --> 00:15:44.760]   the roof, particularly the cost of housing, because of rich yuppies from the Silicon Valley
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:51.280]   moving in, taking their fancy leather, clad, Wi-Fi-enabled buses back and forth.
[00:15:51.280 --> 00:15:54.480]   It's making it hard for San Fransiscoans to live.
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:59.440]   I got to point out the real reason for that is because San Francisco is landlocked.
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:01.760]   It's actually water-locked.
[00:16:01.760 --> 00:16:05.120]   It's a small region.
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:10.320]   The rules the city has created on creating new housing are so prohibitive that nobody's
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:12.040]   building housing.
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.600]   That's what puts pressure on prices.
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.760]   Nevertheless, there have been these protests.
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:21.880]   I'm sad to say Kevin specifically is now being targeted.
[00:16:21.880 --> 00:16:22.880]   Can I show this?
[00:16:22.880 --> 00:16:23.880]   You put it up on it.
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:24.880]   Yeah, go for it.
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:25.880]   Share whatever you like.
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:26.880]   TechCrunch had an article about it.
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:29.960]   Put on first on Instagram, "Parasite Happy Face."
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.560]   Already, I'm starting to think this guy's nuts.
[00:16:32.560 --> 00:16:33.560]   Whoever put this out.
[00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:36.320]   What's with the happy face?
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.320]   This was a...
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:39.520]   How big is this banner?
[00:16:39.520 --> 00:16:40.520]   That's just a handout.
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:42.360]   That was just a little leaflet they were handing out to...
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.120]   But there was also a big banner, right?
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:47.280]   Yeah, they brought like a 10-foot banner that took a few of them to hold it up.
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:48.280]   In front of your house?
[00:16:48.280 --> 00:16:49.280]   Yeah, in front of the house.
[00:16:49.280 --> 00:16:52.000]   And they were chanting like Kevin Rose is a douche.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   Kevin Rose, "Parasite."
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:54.200]   Oh my God, Kevin.
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:55.200]   That's good stuff.
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:56.200]   This makes me so sad.
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.200]   Was it just too sad?
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.200]   Oh, there it is.
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:16:59.200]   How about that one?
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:01.160]   I'm a snip-snip-your-balls.
[00:17:01.160 --> 00:17:04.760]   What is wrong with these people?
[00:17:04.760 --> 00:17:06.600]   Oh my God.
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:09.320]   Anyway, let me read this.
[00:17:09.320 --> 00:17:11.280]   And I want to know what your take is on this.
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:13.960]   And I'm just so saddened.
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:16.280]   Greetings, your neighbor, and then it gives your address.
[00:17:16.280 --> 00:17:18.600]   So they're public seeing your address here.
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:22.840]   A man named Kevin Rose is a parasite.
[00:17:22.840 --> 00:17:25.760]   Perhaps not of you, but of us.
[00:17:25.760 --> 00:17:30.960]   This is why we are here to reveal him for what he is as a partner venture capitalist
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:33.120]   at Google Ventures, Kevin.
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:35.560]   You bad man, you.
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:42.120]   Directs the flow of capital from Google into the tech startup bubble that is destroying
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:43.600]   San Francisco.
[00:17:43.600 --> 00:17:47.360]   The startups that he funds bring the swarms of young entrepreneurs that have ravaged.
[00:17:47.360 --> 00:17:52.200]   My God, you think they're like, what are they eating the trees that have ravaged the
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:55.040]   landscapes of San Francisco and Oakland?
[00:17:55.040 --> 00:17:59.000]   Like locusts with each.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.680]   There's no more corn in San Francisco and I ask you why?
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:08.840]   With each new tech corporation comes a wave of fresh techies who on average earn four
[00:18:08.840 --> 00:18:13.200]   times more than a normal service worker.
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:19.160]   We are the ones who serve them coffee, deliver them food, watch, I'll skip the next one,
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:21.440]   watch their kids and mop their floors.
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:24.240]   Nearly all of them are just like Kevin Rose.
[00:18:24.240 --> 00:18:27.840]   I mean, you got to say at least what, I mean, don't say what it was, but that one that
[00:18:27.840 --> 00:18:29.960]   you're skipping is a, is a doozy.
[00:18:29.960 --> 00:18:30.960]   We are though.
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:31.960]   All right.
[00:18:31.960 --> 00:18:32.960]   I'm going to read it out loud.
[00:18:32.960 --> 00:18:34.800]   You could bleed me later for if you've got kids watching cover their ears.
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:39.480]   We are the ones who serve them coffees, deliver them food, suck their stock.
[00:18:39.480 --> 00:18:40.480]   Really?
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:42.200]   I never got that perk.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:43.200]   I'm wondering.
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:48.520]   I can just tell you that right now.
[00:18:48.520 --> 00:18:52.640]   Is that the end of it you tweeted there was more, but I don't, they, they really complain
[00:18:52.640 --> 00:18:53.640]   about dignity.
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:54.640]   They complain about dignity.
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:59.080]   And they, they, they were upset about a joke that I made many years ago.
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:00.080]   Wait a minute.
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:01.080]   That's real.
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:02.080]   I thought you were being silly on Twitter.
[00:19:02.080 --> 00:19:03.080]   They're being done serious.
[00:19:03.080 --> 00:19:06.040]   They were just going through the internet and trying to find any like dirt to the capacity
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:07.120]   of mention, dignity.
[00:19:07.120 --> 00:19:08.120]   Yeah.
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:12.240]   They, I don't have the flyer here with me, but it said that it was like an awful show
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:15.800]   that ran for six years is what I think what they said.
[00:19:15.800 --> 00:19:16.800]   Oh my God.
[00:19:16.800 --> 00:19:22.160]   An awful show that ran for six years.
[00:19:22.160 --> 00:19:23.160]   Wow.
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:24.160]   What?
[00:19:24.160 --> 00:19:28.160]   So this must make you sick in your stomach.
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.160]   I mean, this is, this is scary stuff.
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:31.160]   Yeah.
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:33.320]   I mean, it's certainly, I wasn't home at the time actually.
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:37.600]   So they, they rang our doorbell and Daria just went downstairs thinking it was like someone
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:41.480]   delivering something and she opened the door and they handed her a flyer and she's like,
[00:19:41.480 --> 00:19:42.480]   what is this?
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:46.120]   And then they start chanting and yelling and she just kind of like closed the door and
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:47.120]   locks it.
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:52.040]   And then calls me up and I was down the street helping some buddies build a skate ramp.
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:53.040]   Actually.
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:57.680]   And you see ravaging San Francisco.
[00:19:57.680 --> 00:20:01.560]   It was a skate ramp for a nonprofit too actually, which is like kind of screwed up.
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:05.080]   I knew you were a bad man.
[00:20:05.080 --> 00:20:10.480]   So I, yeah, I came home and I, and I, you know, walked out and they recognized me and
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:15.400]   they walked up to me and they were like, uh, hi, Timster, Timster's got home.
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:20.280]   They, they basically, uh, you know, walked up to me and they were just like, it started
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:23.240]   throwing, you know, first it was like a lot of insults and then it was just like, how
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:28.200]   can you live with yourself and what you're doing all this, this bad for our city and,
[00:20:28.200 --> 00:20:29.200]   you know,
[00:20:29.200 --> 00:20:30.200]   They're crazy.
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:30.200]   Or the,
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:31.760]   It's the entire thing on an Android phone.
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:33.880]   I'm like, you guys realized you're on the Android phone.
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:35.840]   Like that's, you probably have an iPhone or something.
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:37.680]   That's Google stuff.
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:39.840]   And I asked them where they were going to post and they said YouTube and I'm like, do
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:41.800]   you not see that in all this?
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:44.080]   Like, I'm serious.
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:45.080]   They did.
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:47.640]   They told me when I was saying, well, YouTube because it's free bandwidth man.
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:54.400]   And the thing is like the thing that really gets, it gets me out the core is like, I understand
[00:20:54.400 --> 00:20:55.400]   their frustrations.
[00:20:55.400 --> 00:20:58.800]   Uh, you know, I know you tweeted, I agree with them.
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:02.560]   We need to solve rosings rents, keep the services, co-culture and crack down on landlords.
[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:05.440]   I think you play though, like you don't throw up on people's buses.
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:09.240]   Like there's a conversation to be had here, but it's not by throwing rocks or windows.
[00:21:09.240 --> 00:21:11.160]   You know, throwing up on people's buses.
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:16.200]   I think that, uh, I mean, you, you know how it is when I was working for you at tech TV
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:20.160]   when I first got hired out in the Bay area in the early 2000s.
[00:21:20.160 --> 00:21:23.520]   You know, I was, I remember my starting salary was 28,000 a year.
[00:21:23.520 --> 00:21:24.880]   Yeah, you, you have worked.
[00:21:24.880 --> 00:21:25.880]   I was a merchant assistant.
[00:21:25.880 --> 00:21:30.280]   You have earned everything you, you, every penny you've got, you worked your way up.
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:31.600]   You have to love it.
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:32.600]   You have humble.
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:36.520]   Yeah, you know what it's like to live in San Francisco for, we paid you that little.
[00:21:36.520 --> 00:21:37.520]   Yeah.
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:40.800]   And then I was pissed off because Dan Heward, I found out I was making 30,000 a year.
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:43.360]   So I went to Paul and I said, you give me a $2,000 razor.
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:44.360]   I'm quitting.
[00:21:44.360 --> 00:21:45.360]   I'm so sorry.
[00:21:45.360 --> 00:21:46.360]   I'm paying you that little.
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:47.360]   I know.
[00:21:47.360 --> 00:21:49.360]   It's a nice, I just knew his job.
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:53.760]   You know, tech TV is ruining San Francisco.
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:54.760]   That's awesome.
[00:21:54.760 --> 00:21:59.440]   No, but that's the point is that, look, you were building the skate ramp for a nut profit.
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:03.240]   This is, this is not the Kevin Rosano, obviously.
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:05.400]   And it doesn't even make sense.
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:10.480]   It's like, are they, there are certainly issues, but their issues are, don't go back
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:15.560]   to Google or even startups or any of this.
[00:22:15.560 --> 00:22:17.640]   And I know you're sympathetic to that.
[00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:20.440]   I wonder if these people are crazy.
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:22.640]   Are they genuine you think?
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:28.840]   You know, it's, I think that their, their complaints are certainly found in reality.
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:31.440]   Like there are some really shady things going on here.
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:36.680]   Like landlords are kicking out long time tenants and then instantly jacking up the prices
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:40.000]   because they know they can get it with some of the tech folks that are making more.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:41.600]   And so people are getting displaced.
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:45.120]   So that's frustrating, you know, it's frustrating to a lot of people.
[00:22:45.120 --> 00:22:50.040]   So there are complaints to be had here and a conversation to be had, but I certainly don't
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:56.240]   think that Google and some of these other tech companies are necessarily at fault.
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:59.720]   I mean, yes, they are bringing in more tech workers, but I think that there's a lot of
[00:22:59.720 --> 00:23:01.320]   good being done here as well.
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:05.960]   I mean, I certainly know what we do at Google Ventures and funding tech companies and, you
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:09.600]   know, we, Foundation Medicine is one of our big companies that is working on cures for
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:14.200]   cancer and like we're trying to like, it's not just funding companies for the sake of
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:15.200]   funding companies.
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:17.760]   Like there's a kind of a bigger, bigger mission here.
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:18.760]   Absolutely.
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:24.320]   And I mean, if you look at, I mean, I, if you wanted to protest against the financial industry,
[00:23:24.320 --> 00:23:25.320]   I'll join you.
[00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:30.800]   If there's lots of places you can complain, Google doesn't seem to be one of them or any
[00:23:30.800 --> 00:23:32.760]   of the startup industry.
[00:23:32.760 --> 00:23:36.560]   Have you gotten the sense, Kevin, that has, have you talking about this?
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:40.240]   Has that made anyone else say that this also happened to them?
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:43.920]   Or is this just a random Kevin Rose targeting?
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:46.680]   I know it has happened to a few other people.
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:49.600]   I don't know who those people are, but I saw something about someone left a comment on
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:51.880]   my Instagram post saying that it happened to them.
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:55.440]   And then I know that there was at least one other Googler that it happened to.
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:56.440]   Right.
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:57.440]   There was the self-driving car guy.
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:23:58.440]   Oh, yes.
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:23:59.440]   Right.
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:00.440]   Right.
[00:24:00.440 --> 00:24:05.040]   Are you going to hire a security guard?
[00:24:05.040 --> 00:24:07.480]   Are you concerned?
[00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:09.600]   At this point, we have Google security on it.
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:10.960]   So, you know, I've reached out to them.
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:16.240]   They have a pretty decent department there that handles this type of stuff.
[00:24:16.240 --> 00:24:19.440]   But you know, it's, there's no real concern here.
[00:24:19.440 --> 00:24:20.640]   My house is pretty locked down.
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:23.840]   I have cameras all over the place and, you know, I've kind of created a little bunker
[00:24:23.840 --> 00:24:25.520]   here, so I'm not too worried about that.
[00:24:25.520 --> 00:24:30.400]   But it is obviously, you know, it gets here like stomach grumbling and you're a little
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:31.400]   tense and you're shaking.
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:34.760]   And of course, my wife, Daria was, was spooked out by the whole thing.
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:38.080]   And it's, you just don't know how, how far it's going to go.
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:41.720]   You know, right now, yes, I was able to sit down outside and actually have a conversation
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:44.000]   with these folks and it wasn't aggressive.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:45.680]   Like they weren't here to throw rocks.
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:50.680]   They, they were upset and invisibly upset, but they weren't like, I didn't feel at all
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:53.240]   like they were going to start a fight.
[00:24:53.240 --> 00:24:56.800]   And then the cops showed up and then they just, they just kind of ran and they took off.
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:01.200]   I got to tell you though, to be careful about mobs because individual humans are fine.
[00:25:01.200 --> 00:25:07.000]   But when they get in a group, sometimes they will do that, you know, they wouldn't do as
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:08.800]   individuals.
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:13.200]   So don't, don't underestimate the risks to you when you go out and talk to them.
[00:25:13.200 --> 00:25:14.200]   I had, I honor you.
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:18.840]   I would have done the same thing, but that's, that can be dangerous because mobs will do
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:20.240]   stupid things that are.
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:21.740]   That's true.
[00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:24.880]   Have you and Daria maybe even thought about moving out of San Francisco?
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:26.920]   Now, you know, we love you here.
[00:25:26.920 --> 00:25:30.000]   This is, this is our home and it's been our home for, for quite some time.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.440]   You know, I've been here since 2000 myself.
[00:25:32.440 --> 00:25:35.720]   So it's longer than any other place I've lived.
[00:25:35.720 --> 00:25:36.760]   And I consider it to be home.
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:40.480]   So, you know, I think there's a lot of really positive, awesome things that are happening
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:42.440]   here in, in a bunch of different sectors.
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:47.000]   So I think that, you know, this is certainly, for me, it's just something to pay attention
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.280]   to and it's something that I think that, you know, I saw Ron Conway at the crunchies
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:54.640]   give a long talk about how the tech community in general has to come together to solve
[00:25:54.640 --> 00:25:55.640]   some of these problems.
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:57.400]   And I certainly believe that's the case.
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:01.240]   So, you know, I would like to take part in that conversation and sit down with some folks
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:06.000]   that are willing to have a conversation that isn't aggressive and, and hopefully that,
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   that will happen.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:08.520]   But yeah, this is home.
[00:26:08.520 --> 00:26:11.160]   So we, we don't plan on moving anytime soon.
[00:26:11.160 --> 00:26:15.960]   Kevin, I, it just, I saw that and I was so saddened.
[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:18.960]   And I agree there, there are real problems that need to be addressed, but that's, but
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:19.960]   you're not the cause.
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:21.520]   Well, I sent them to your house.
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:22.520]   Okay.
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:23.520]   Thank you.
[00:26:23.520 --> 00:26:24.520]   It's my fault.
[00:26:24.520 --> 00:26:28.240]   I am the 1% and you can come after me anytime.
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:30.080]   Petaluma has been ravaged.
[00:26:30.080 --> 00:26:33.960]   I say ravaged by people like me.
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:34.960]   Thank you, Kevin.
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:36.680]   I appreciate you taking some time to talk about this.
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:39.400]   And I really actually admire your point of view on it.
[00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:43.520]   I think you're a, it seems like Kevin, they chose the right person to target in a way
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:53.480]   because you're not too, I mean, I wish no, uh, uh, it'll upon you at all.
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:56.280]   But you're not too free to buy it.
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:26:58.200]   Maybe it's like a good channel for a conversation to start.
[00:26:58.200 --> 00:26:59.200]   I don't know.
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:03.800]   Maybe that's too, uh, look the upside of it, but, uh, if anybody would be constantly
[00:27:03.800 --> 00:27:07.000]   with Instagram, I mean, I was, I've been on this weekend and I saw it just like went out
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   immediately.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   People started talking about it.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:15.200]   They were a little shocked when I kind of tried to like, you know, bring it back to, we
[00:27:15.200 --> 00:27:17.200]   started talking about jobs and how you get started.
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:21.280]   I kind of, you know, let them know that I didn't just wasn't born in VC.
[00:27:21.280 --> 00:27:25.600]   Um, and I actually was a college dropout and that was, I think it was pretty shocking
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:26.800]   to them.
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:31.160]   And so, you know, you just kind of try and, and, and have a real conversation around
[00:27:31.160 --> 00:27:32.400]   us rather than yelling.
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:36.640]   And so it started to happen at the end, but then the police showed up, but, um, we'll,
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:39.520]   we'll see where this goes.
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:44.240]   By the way, we got that picture at Kevin Rose is a terrible person.wordpress.com in case
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:45.800]   you want to, uh, sweet.
[00:27:45.800 --> 00:27:46.800]   Isn't that nice?
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:47.800]   That's nice.
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:51.080]   You know, Kevin was one of the great people in the world.
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:52.280]   And really cares deeply.
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:54.720]   And it's just so wrong.
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:56.600]   Kevin Rose leech.
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:58.000]   That's so wrong, folks.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.080]   You know, that's sad.
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:03.720]   Here's a guy who's actually done a lot of to create, uh, employment.
[00:28:03.720 --> 00:28:05.720]   I appreciate that.
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:06.720]   Thanks, Kevin.
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:07.720]   I'm sorry that happened.
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:09.280]   Uh, love to you both.
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:10.280]   Thank you so much.
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:11.280]   Thanks for having me on.
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:12.280]   Take care.
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:13.280]   Cheers guys.
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:14.640]   Thanks me so sad.
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:16.920]   All right.
[00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:17.920]   Let's take a break.
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:21.160]   Going back more, Liz Gaines is here from a recode.net.
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:22.920]   Not net.
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:24.960]   Patrick Bejau from France.
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:28.440]   I need a better, I need something better.
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:31.400]   Uh, you got a better one.
[00:28:31.400 --> 00:28:32.400]   Patrick's up.
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:36.400]   I could say, you know, Patrick Bejau.com, I guess, you know, yeah, Patrick Bejau.com
[00:28:36.400 --> 00:28:38.040]   works or not Patrick.
[00:28:38.040 --> 00:28:39.040]   Yeah.
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:40.040]   Yeah.
[00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:41.040]   Yeah.
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:42.040]   All right.
[00:28:42.040 --> 00:28:43.040]   It's fine.
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:45.280]   You know, I like it from all the tools I'm on.
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:47.200]   You're from France.
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:48.200]   I just like that.
[00:28:48.200 --> 00:28:52.280]   And I do want to talk a little bit about how television and content is treated differently
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:55.320]   in France and Europe than from here.
[00:28:55.320 --> 00:28:57.600]   Because that is, we got into that topic as a good topic.
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:00.600]   But first let's talk about audible.com.
[00:29:00.600 --> 00:29:03.600]   When you're riding in the Google bus and you got the Wi-Fi, the leather seats, there's
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:06.400]   nothing better than also having your headphones on.
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:12.320]   Maybe those, maybe those Bose quiet comfort three headphones on, you know, the titanium
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:15.280]   model and listen to one of your, I'm sorry.
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:17.200]   I should just stop.
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:18.200]   I should just stop.
[00:29:18.200 --> 00:29:19.200]   Oh, look at this.
[00:29:19.200 --> 00:29:20.200]   Mary Roach's Gulp.
[00:29:20.200 --> 00:29:21.200]   This is a great book.
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:24.440]   In fact, any of Mary Roach's books are great at audible.
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:25.880]   I'm going to get you two books free.
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:30.280]   So maybe you could do a Gulp, which is the story of the elementary canal with bonk, the
[00:29:30.280 --> 00:29:33.200]   story of sex or stiff, the story of cadavers.
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:38.880]   She also wrote a great book called Packing for Mars, the curious science of life in the
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:39.880]   void.
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:46.440]   Spook, science tackles the afterlife and my planet finding humor in the oddest places.
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:48.800]   She is actually one of my favorite authors.
[00:29:48.800 --> 00:29:52.840]   I think this is when I first became aware of her a couple of years ago.
[00:29:52.840 --> 00:30:01.560]   It's the study of death, stiff, the curious life of human cadavers.
[00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:06.120]   And then you can go on to Gulp and bonk and really, really have some fun.
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:10.640]   Audible is a great place to go to get audio books of all kinds.
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:15.760]   Those are nonfiction books, but they both course got fiction books to like Danielle Suarez's
[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:16.760]   latest.
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:18.520]   I think I just made Daniel a girl.
[00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:20.920]   Danielle Suarez is greatest in flux.
[00:30:20.920 --> 00:30:21.920]   Wow.
[00:30:21.920 --> 00:30:24.600]   Is that a that is a page turner?
[00:30:24.600 --> 00:30:27.440]   We need a word for page turners on audible.
[00:30:27.440 --> 00:30:29.560]   That is a.
[00:30:29.560 --> 00:30:30.560]   Unposables.
[00:30:30.560 --> 00:30:31.560]   Unposable.
[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:32.560]   Oh, I like it.
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:33.800]   That's an unpossible.
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:38.120]   That's a drive around the block three times because I don't want to stop listening, even
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:39.680]   though I'm home.
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:47.640]   In your car at work on the treadmill at your desk, audible is a great companion.
[00:30:47.640 --> 00:30:50.400]   150,000 titles in every category.
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:53.080]   Oh, this is cool.
[00:30:53.080 --> 00:30:56.840]   Mike Elgin was talking about this last week.
[00:30:56.840 --> 00:31:01.240]   The Bizstone book, Things a Little Bird Told Me, Confessions of a Creative Mind is unaudible
[00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:02.240]   as well.
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:04.400]   Audible has the best readers, by the way.
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:07.760]   That's a that's a big part of this is you're listening.
[00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:10.760]   Oh, I really want this one.
[00:31:10.760 --> 00:31:15.200]   I think I'm going to put this on my on my audible next lesson.
[00:31:15.200 --> 00:31:16.960]   Flash Boys, a Wall Street revolt.
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:20.240]   This is the new Michael Lewis book about high frequency trading.
[00:31:20.240 --> 00:31:21.960]   It is the talk of the town.
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:23.080]   That's one of the things about audible.
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:26.360]   It's great is you're not getting last year's books.
[00:31:26.360 --> 00:31:27.360]   I mean, you could.
[00:31:27.360 --> 00:31:29.920]   In fact, they've got classics and great literature too.
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:35.880]   But all of the new books now come out on audible.com day and date of their release in the bookstore.
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:36.880]   And that's awesome.
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:38.160]   You're never left behind.
[00:31:38.160 --> 00:31:40.680]   Anything by Michael Lewis is a must read.
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:44.160]   He is just one of my favorite authors.
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:51.760]   But his latest flash boys about high frequency trading is really hot stuff.
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:54.120]   Audible.com/twit2.
[00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:57.000]   That's audible.com, Twit and the number two.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.000]   We'll get you two books.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:31:59.280]   You're going to sign up for the platinum account.
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:01.000]   That's the two book a month subscription.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.240]   It also includes your daily digest of either the New York Times or the Wall Street Journal.
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:06.240]   That's nice.
[00:32:06.240 --> 00:32:08.040]   You're going to get some great listening.
[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:10.240]   You can cancel any time in the first 30 days, pay nothing.
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:11.760]   Those books are yours to keep.
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:13.160]   But I think you're going to want to stick around.
[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:14.160]   This is fabulous.
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:15.160]   I listen all the time.
[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:18.360]   Chad and I had a great conversation last night or I guess it was Friday night.
[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:19.360]   Yeah.
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:20.360]   I didn't realize you were such an audible fan.
[00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:22.440]   I am a huge audible fan.
[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:27.520]   I've been listening to audio books in one form and another for years.
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:30.240]   And when I found Audible, it's the best way to listen to audio books.
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:31.240]   Great courses.
[00:32:31.240 --> 00:32:35.040]   You said this was like a college education in your iPod.
[00:32:35.040 --> 00:32:38.720]   So audible.com/twit2.
[00:32:38.720 --> 00:32:39.720]   Try it today.
[00:32:39.720 --> 00:32:40.960]   I know you're going to like it.
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:44.920]   I'm going to just quickly before we move on by Flash Boys.
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:45.920]   I have two credits.
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:47.400]   I love it when I get two credits.
[00:32:47.400 --> 00:32:48.400]   It's so nice.
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:49.400]   Audible.
[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:51.040]   Oh, there's some other books I want to listen to too.
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:32:53.280]   Oh, and that new haunted empire.
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:55.000]   What did you think of that Liz Gaines?
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.160]   I'm sure you.
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:57.160]   Did you know you carded?
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:58.160]   I read it actually.
[00:32:58.160 --> 00:32:59.160]   Yeah.
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:00.160]   A lot of, you know--
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:03.320]   Interesting to see Apple come out so strongly against it.
[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:09.080]   I mean, I kind of my, this is obviously an uninformed take given I haven't read the book,
[00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:12.840]   but I think it might be a little bit too early to write a book about Tim Cook's Rain
[00:33:12.840 --> 00:33:13.840]   at Apple.
[00:33:13.840 --> 00:33:16.080]   It is a little early.
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:20.720]   The premise is that it's haunted by Steve Jobs' ghost, of course.
[00:33:20.720 --> 00:33:26.360]   And it does, I think imply that Apple is not going to do too well in the future.
[00:33:26.360 --> 00:33:28.680]   We don't know that yet.
[00:33:28.680 --> 00:33:31.480]   But the criticism I've heard from some, and I haven't read it either.
[00:33:31.480 --> 00:33:39.200]   In fact, I'm going to put that in my card as well, is that it's a lot of anecdotal stuff.
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:40.360]   Some of it not accurate.
[00:33:40.360 --> 00:33:42.120]   Some of it people deny.
[00:33:42.120 --> 00:33:43.120]   Say it's not true.
[00:33:43.120 --> 00:33:48.080]   Well, Apple actually put out, Tim Cook put out a statement against the book, which is
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:50.920]   pretty, I mean, I guess it's not that unusual, but--
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:51.920]   Hell, Steve.
[00:33:51.920 --> 00:33:53.320]   --for an unusual for Apple.
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:57.360]   I remember Steve Jobs, I remember which book it was.
[00:33:57.360 --> 00:34:03.960]   But Steve Jobs, one of the books about him came out, pulled it from-- what is he to?
[00:34:03.960 --> 00:34:06.960]   He pulled it from all the Apple stores.
[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:10.200]   He made sure-- oh, he pulled the publisher from all the Apple stores.
[00:34:10.200 --> 00:34:11.200]   So they punished the publisher.
[00:34:11.200 --> 00:34:12.880]   Oh, yeah, that's right.
[00:34:12.880 --> 00:34:13.880]   Yeah.
[00:34:13.880 --> 00:34:15.360]   Yeah, well.
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:16.840]   So I think this is not new.
[00:34:16.840 --> 00:34:20.400]   I think it should be less buttoned up than in the private and tell their own story if
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:22.400]   they're so mad about other people.
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:27.400]   This is not a new phenomenon.
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:33.480]   Yeah, maybe they just-- yeah, I think-- you know.
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:35.080]   So let's see.
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:36.400]   We can move on a little bit.
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:43.360]   There was a big event in San Francisco this week called Build, Microsoft's Developer Conference,
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:47.200]   and they announced a ton of stuff.
[00:34:47.200 --> 00:34:52.960]   Let me go through a few of the big stories.
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:59.840]   One is, of course, that Windows is now free on devices with screens under 9 inches, which
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:06.680]   would never have happened under Steve Ballmer or Bill Gates.
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:10.840]   That was the crown-- there's-- they're giving away the crown jewels.
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:17.640]   These are response, obviously, to Android and to get Windows on mobile devices and maybe
[00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:21.720]   to get Windows 8.1 out there.
[00:35:21.720 --> 00:35:24.640]   So does that mean because they're saying phone and tablets?
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:28.400]   Does that mean that Windows phone is free for everyone?
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:29.600]   No, no, no.
[00:35:29.600 --> 00:35:30.600]   So phones--
[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:32.920]   Let's not go crazy here.
[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:35.280]   But they are saying phones and tablets, right?
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:38.400]   They are-- well, they're saying anything with a 9-inch or less screen-- or under 9-inch
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:39.400]   screen.
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:44.440]   There are a lot of 8-inch tablets like the Dell Venue that are Windows-- full Windows
[00:35:44.440 --> 00:35:45.440]   on an 8-inch tablet.
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:46.440]   Lenovo has one.
[00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:48.240]   I think Toshiba might have one.
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:50.000]   I know Dell has one.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:56.400]   So those guys-- that's a big deal for those guys.
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:36:01.440]   They also cut the license costs in general significantly.
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:06.660]   So this is-- I think you could make the case that Satya-- this is a Satya Nadella move.
[00:36:06.660 --> 00:36:11.220]   Some of the things like Windows Phone 8.1, obviously, in the works for a long time.
[00:36:11.220 --> 00:36:14.660]   Update-- the new update for Windows 8.1 in the works for a long time.
[00:36:14.660 --> 00:36:20.500]   But he's-- I think Satya is really taking Microsoft in a new direction.
[00:36:20.500 --> 00:36:25.860]   Well, they want to get everyone involved in their ecosystem.
[00:36:25.860 --> 00:36:31.740]   And obviously, Nadella is very much cloud and services-oriented.
[00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:40.060]   So and-- I mean, Windows on these types of devices has not been doing too well.
[00:36:40.060 --> 00:36:41.060]   No.
[00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:47.020]   So they do need to do something to get it a little bit more popular.
[00:36:47.020 --> 00:36:49.860]   And obviously, that is one of the things that they could be doing.
[00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:55.620]   And hopefully, by emphasizing the services aspect of Microsoft, then maybe they can pull
[00:36:55.620 --> 00:37:02.420]   people in with cheaper devices that get the juice going on the services.
[00:37:02.420 --> 00:37:08.060]   But the sad thing is, I'm not even sure that that will be enough.
[00:37:08.060 --> 00:37:09.060]   Too late.
[00:37:09.060 --> 00:37:10.060]   Too late, you think?
[00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:12.620]   I don't know if it's too late.
[00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:17.660]   It's not-- I love my Windows 8 PC.
[00:37:17.660 --> 00:37:18.660]   I really love it.
[00:37:18.660 --> 00:37:21.780]   I've been one of the few people who actually enjoys Windows 8.
[00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:25.300]   But I think people just don't want it.
[00:37:25.300 --> 00:37:26.300]   They do right.
[00:37:26.300 --> 00:37:27.300]   I think you're right.
[00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:32.340]   OK, I'm going to talk about an off-the-record conversation I had with two very well-known
[00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:37.900]   Windows watchers who may or may not do a podcast on this network.
[00:37:37.900 --> 00:37:41.740]   And what we were talking about-- and I don't know why they haven't said this more forcefully
[00:37:41.740 --> 00:37:44.020]   on that podcast.
[00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:51.780]   But what we were talking about is the idea that apparent-- what seems to have happened
[00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:58.580]   is for reasons no one fully understands, Microsoft said to Steven Sanofsky, "Go make
[00:37:58.580 --> 00:38:03.580]   Windows 8, and we are going to let you rethink the whole thing and we're not going to weigh
[00:38:03.580 --> 00:38:04.580]   in."
[00:38:04.580 --> 00:38:07.020]   Anything goes, Steven.
[00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:14.300]   And Sanofsky went off and created this kind of nightmare hybrid of touch and desktop.
[00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:19.900]   And not one person at Microsoft, not one person on the board, said boo to Sanofsky.
[00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:21.900]   Sanofsky is the right guy to do it.
[00:38:21.900 --> 00:38:26.860]   He had great success with Office, the ribbon.
[00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:32.140]   He was very forceful apparently in the way he communicated his ideas.
[00:38:32.140 --> 00:38:33.140]   I asked them.
[00:38:33.140 --> 00:38:36.340]   I said, "Well, is Sanofsky that persuasive?
[00:38:36.340 --> 00:38:37.980]   Is it like perceived at Microsoft?
[00:38:37.980 --> 00:38:38.980]   He's the genius?"
[00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:43.060]   And they said, "No, he's just very forceful."
[00:38:43.060 --> 00:38:44.780]   Windows came out.
[00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:46.980]   Sanofsky was terminated.
[00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:50.300]   Ballmer, I think, was forced out as a result.
[00:38:50.300 --> 00:38:54.580]   It has been a very-- I think it's safe to say big failure.
[00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:56.100]   And Windows is the crown jewel.
[00:38:56.100 --> 00:38:59.220]   You do not mess with the crown jewel at Microsoft.
[00:38:59.220 --> 00:39:05.260]   And the real flaw goes back to management saying, "Go ahead.
[00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:06.500]   Do whatever you want."
[00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:10.540]   Well, there's a key thing which he said right there.
[00:39:10.540 --> 00:39:15.300]   He talked about the ribbon and how Sanofsky was the one who made it.
[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:20.300]   And the thing is, a lot of people still hate the ribbon.
[00:39:20.300 --> 00:39:24.900]   It is incredibly better than what was before.
[00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:28.860]   That forest of menus and everything, but it still has a horrible image.
[00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:35.020]   So I'm wondering if they were getting some feedback or maybe themselves were thinking,
[00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:41.140]   "What thing that he's doing with Windows were not sure that we don't like it, but we
[00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:42.780]   also didn't like the ribbon."
[00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:46.380]   And it turns out the ribbon is actually better for productivity.
[00:39:46.380 --> 00:39:49.220]   And we need to move in a different direction.
[00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:54.020]   So it's easy in hindsight to say, "Well, obviously, Windows would never have worked
[00:39:54.020 --> 00:39:55.380]   the way it is now."
[00:39:55.380 --> 00:40:02.020]   But they had to worry about the touch interfaces and the tablets and all of that.
[00:40:02.020 --> 00:40:04.580]   And they needed to do something radical.
[00:40:04.580 --> 00:40:11.220]   So basically something that a lot of people said at the time as well, if Windows had not
[00:40:11.220 --> 00:40:18.900]   done this, we would all be sitting here, saying, criticizing them for not thinking differently
[00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:24.780]   and doing things in a different enough direction.
[00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:30.540]   So I can understand definitely why they would leave him free rein to change everything and
[00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:38.180]   not hold it back in when they realize maybe they as individuals don't like it as much.
[00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:42.660]   It seems clear that it's why Ballmer had to step down.
[00:40:42.660 --> 00:40:44.860]   And I think Satya Nadella was chosen.
[00:40:44.860 --> 00:40:46.460]   They wanted somebody inside Microsoft.
[00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:49.460]   Maybe they wanted some people outside Microsoft who said no.
[00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:53.860]   But I think he was a very good choice because the future of Microsoft clearly is in the
[00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:55.180]   cloud, yes?
[00:40:55.180 --> 00:40:57.420]   The future of computing is in the cloud.
[00:40:57.420 --> 00:40:58.660]   The future of everyone.
[00:40:58.660 --> 00:40:59.660]   Yeah.
[00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:02.700]   I think you're getting into trouble when you're talking about giving away the crown jewels
[00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:10.020]   because that's the attitude that will not allow you to focus on whatever's coming next.
[00:41:10.020 --> 00:41:11.300]   Right.
[00:41:11.300 --> 00:41:14.740]   Right.
[00:41:14.740 --> 00:41:15.740]   So it is a new Microsoft.
[00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:17.540]   I think there's no question in my mind.
[00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:21.540]   It's a new Microsoft giving away Windows.
[00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:24.380]   I have to say Windows Phone 8.1 is the first...
[00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:27.460]   I've always thought highly of Windows Phone.
[00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:28.780]   I think they did reinvent that.
[00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:31.340]   In fact, that's one of the reasons I think they let Sanovsky do what he did is because
[00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:34.260]   they said, "Well, this interface was working really well on phone.
[00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:37.420]   Let's try bringing that to the desktop."
[00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:38.420]   It's good.
[00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:40.060]   It's just late to the party and doesn't have the apps.
[00:41:40.060 --> 00:41:47.980]   But Windows Phone 8.1 fills a lot of holes, especially with Cortana, which is the voice
[00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:52.540]   activated personal assistant for Windows 8.1.
[00:41:52.540 --> 00:41:54.180]   Microsoft has it in a unique position.
[00:41:54.180 --> 00:41:55.340]   Apple has Siri, of course.
[00:41:55.340 --> 00:41:57.380]   Google has its own voice.
[00:41:57.380 --> 00:41:58.380]   Microsoft's a little...
[00:41:58.380 --> 00:42:02.820]   Apple's a little hobbled by the fact that it's made the decision and I think a lot of
[00:42:02.820 --> 00:42:06.580]   people embrace this decision to protect its users' privacy.
[00:42:06.580 --> 00:42:11.020]   The unlike Google, they are not willing to aggregate all the data from all the different
[00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:14.620]   things they know about you and make Siri better because of it.
[00:42:14.620 --> 00:42:15.820]   Siri, a lot of people...
[00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:18.020]   I felt like Siri was better before Apple got it.
[00:42:18.020 --> 00:42:19.940]   It did more.
[00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:22.140]   Apple can't do a Google...
[00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:23.140]   That's definitely...
[00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:24.140]   That's true.
[00:42:24.140 --> 00:42:26.740]   I mean, Siri was different before Apple bought it.
[00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:29.660]   It tied into the APIs of a whole bunch of different services.
[00:42:29.660 --> 00:42:34.700]   So you do all sorts of things like plan your whole date for the evening without ever leaving
[00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:36.700]   the app.
[00:42:36.700 --> 00:42:42.260]   I think that if you look at the little incremental updates, I'm an iPhone user and if you look,
[00:42:42.260 --> 00:42:44.860]   it's starting to get much more like a personal assistant.
[00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:49.020]   You see that in the voice thing, but it's not just about voice in Siri.
[00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:50.420]   It's also about...
[00:42:50.420 --> 00:42:55.100]   If you pull down your screen, it'll tell you things like how many meetings you have that
[00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:57.420]   day, what the weather's like.
[00:42:57.420 --> 00:43:01.940]   And it's becoming more and more useful in doing that, anticipating your needs rather
[00:43:01.940 --> 00:43:05.940]   than waiting for you to search for things, which is where Google is going.
[00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:07.820]   It's a better experience in a lot of ways.
[00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:11.900]   As long as you're willing to let your phone know where you're located and look at your
[00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:15.180]   calendar and stuff like that, but you've already done that if you're using iPhone.
[00:43:15.180 --> 00:43:16.180]   Yeah.
[00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:22.460]   What Apple doesn't have the Google has is your search, your email, your YouTube choices.
[00:43:22.460 --> 00:43:27.100]   And Microsoft is saying what they have is your Xbox and...
[00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:28.100]   They have a lot.
[00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:30.540]   They're better positioned than Apple, I think.
[00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:31.540]   It's just high-end too.
[00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:33.740]   See, Google, I'm looking at my Google Now cards.
[00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:36.220]   It says, "How long it's going to take me to get home?"
[00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:39.020]   I mean, I guess Apple could do that.
[00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:43.540]   The giants game, because it knows, because I searched for giants, it knows I follow the
[00:43:43.540 --> 00:43:45.620]   giants.
[00:43:45.620 --> 00:43:48.300]   For some reason, it thinks I like Moon Alice.
[00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:49.820]   That's a mistake.
[00:43:49.820 --> 00:43:51.220]   It knows what stocks I follow.
[00:43:51.220 --> 00:43:53.300]   Oh, look, it knows that I ordered a Fire TV.
[00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:58.180]   I expect to see more postings there, because that came in through Gmail.
[00:43:58.180 --> 00:44:00.340]   So Apple is not willing to do that.
[00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:02.700]   And rightly so, I think they provide an alternative to people who are...
[00:44:02.700 --> 00:44:03.700]   They're not far off, though.
[00:44:03.700 --> 00:44:05.420]   I mean, not to get in the...
[00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:09.780]   Let's look at our phones harder, War, but I'm just looking down at Apple.
[00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:10.980]   They tell me what the weather is.
[00:44:10.980 --> 00:44:15.140]   I am currently at home, so it's not going to tell me how long it will take to get home.
[00:44:15.140 --> 00:44:16.140]   Would Apple do that?
[00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:18.020]   Would Siri do that?
[00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:19.020]   Oh.
[00:44:19.020 --> 00:44:20.020]   How do you...
[00:44:20.020 --> 00:44:22.620]   Like, you got to get going, you got to be home?
[00:44:22.620 --> 00:44:25.940]   Yeah, in fact, it says tomorrow your calendar looks clear in the morning, but you have three
[00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:28.540]   events scheduled the first one starting at 12 p.m.
[00:44:28.540 --> 00:44:29.540]   Okay.
[00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:30.540]   But that's your calendar.
[00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:32.380]   And you explicitly gave it permission.
[00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:35.340]   I think Apple's going to be hobbled, because I really think that they don't want to go
[00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:36.340]   so far.
[00:44:36.340 --> 00:44:38.220]   Google's willing to go to any length.
[00:44:38.220 --> 00:44:46.020]   In fact, they just updated the way that logging in to your Gmail works on your iPhone.
[00:44:46.020 --> 00:44:49.860]   I'm sure you knew this, Liz, but now, since you use the iPhone, but now because you're
[00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:54.100]   logged in to Gmail, you're logged into all the other Google services, you know, you don't
[00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:55.100]   have to worry about it.
[00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:57.700]   Google's making itself much more of a package deal than it was before.
[00:44:57.700 --> 00:45:01.140]   Yeah, and then, of course, they're saying, and we're going to aggregate all of that information.
[00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:05.180]   So when you watch a YouTube video, now we associate it with your account, whether you
[00:45:05.180 --> 00:45:06.340]   knew it or not.
[00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:09.700]   I just didn't bother me, but it bothers some people.
[00:45:09.700 --> 00:45:10.700]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:15.940]   I mean, I understand that I'm doing a trade-off of privacy convenience everywhere in my online
[00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:16.940]   life.
[00:45:16.940 --> 00:45:20.940]   I also have an Android phone, and by comparison, I think that there's a lot of things that
[00:45:20.940 --> 00:45:23.460]   does a lot better because it's a more cohesive experience.
[00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:27.660]   It's not as all these discrete apps split out from each other with no knowledge of what
[00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:28.940]   the other ones are doing.
[00:45:28.940 --> 00:45:34.940]   Well, and my point is that Microsoft is better positioned than Apple to do this because they
[00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:36.940]   have Bing.
[00:45:36.940 --> 00:45:37.940]   They have enough.
[00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:40.060]   Yeah, if you really live in that world, if you're really a Microsoft.
[00:45:40.060 --> 00:45:41.060]   You have to be a Windows.
[00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:42.860]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, I agree.
[00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:43.860]   I was impressed.
[00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:47.180]   My Cortana is the name of the personal assistant, the voice.
[00:45:47.180 --> 00:45:48.180]   She's got a good voice.
[00:45:48.180 --> 00:45:53.780]   In fact, she's got arguably a better voice than either Siri or Google because some of
[00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:57.820]   the speech is prerecorded actual voice.
[00:45:57.820 --> 00:45:59.420]   Some of it synthesized, some of it's not.
[00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:04.580]   It's a little disconcerting when you listen because it's the same voice, but one sounds
[00:46:04.580 --> 00:46:06.780]   more synthesized.
[00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:08.020]   But it doesn't.
[00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:09.020]   Yeah.
[00:46:09.020 --> 00:46:10.020]   Yeah.
[00:46:10.020 --> 00:46:11.020]   It's okay.
[00:46:11.020 --> 00:46:17.260]   I feel like, oh, that was the virtual assistant I was waiting for.
[00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:18.260]   It's good.
[00:46:18.260 --> 00:46:22.900]   It's nice that Microsoft is getting in on that game as well.
[00:46:22.900 --> 00:46:28.940]   But what I felt was really interesting in all of those conferences was, I guess what
[00:46:28.940 --> 00:46:33.020]   Microsoft does best is ubiquity.
[00:46:33.020 --> 00:46:39.340]   And they made a lot of noise about the fact that you'll be able to develop apps that will
[00:46:39.340 --> 00:46:42.220]   be, you know, they're unifying the binary.
[00:46:42.220 --> 00:46:43.820]   That's a huge thing too.
[00:46:43.820 --> 00:46:45.060]   That's, yeah, exactly.
[00:46:45.060 --> 00:46:51.900]   That's, you know, Windows runtime runs the same across all its platforms, including Xbox
[00:46:51.900 --> 00:46:56.060]   and, you know, they're going really, really wide with this.
[00:46:56.060 --> 00:47:00.900]   And they're even, you know, they're announcing availability in the car.
[00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:05.860]   There was even a leak about Windows for devices where they were talking about, can't remember
[00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:10.820]   coffee mugs and, you know, just wearables in general.
[00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:16.260]   So it seems like they're, I think that Nadella is going to get the credit for a lot of the
[00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:18.660]   changes that are going to be happening this year.
[00:47:18.660 --> 00:47:23.460]   But it feels like a lot of those have been in the works for the past couple of years when,
[00:47:23.460 --> 00:47:24.940]   you know, Windows 8 first came out.
[00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:25.940]   Yeah.
[00:47:25.940 --> 00:47:26.940]   He's only been on the job a few months.
[00:47:26.940 --> 00:47:29.220]   He obviously didn't have anything to do with Cortana.
[00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:30.220]   But yeah.
[00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:36.140]   Nevertheless, I do think that he is more willing to say, you know, on the iPad announcement,
[00:47:36.140 --> 00:47:38.060]   he said, let me give me my iPad.
[00:47:38.060 --> 00:47:39.060]   Never.
[00:47:39.060 --> 00:47:40.140]   You would never restore bombers say that.
[00:47:40.140 --> 00:47:41.460]   He stopped on an iPhone.
[00:47:41.460 --> 00:47:44.780]   Mark stopped on an iPhone at all hands meeting a couple of years ago.
[00:47:44.780 --> 00:47:45.780]   Yeah.
[00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:50.660]   The release finally of the office on iPad, that probably would have still taken a little
[00:47:50.660 --> 00:47:51.660]   bit more time.
[00:47:51.660 --> 00:47:53.060]   Nadella is putting his stamp on it.
[00:47:53.060 --> 00:47:58.380]   And I think it goes along with things like getting Windows Phone 8.1 up to parity with
[00:47:58.380 --> 00:48:00.780]   iPhone and Android phone.
[00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:05.380]   You can ask one of the things you can tell that see, this is where Microsoft has a little
[00:48:05.380 --> 00:48:06.380]   bit of an advantage.
[00:48:06.380 --> 00:48:07.380]   They own Skype.
[00:48:07.380 --> 00:48:12.380]   So you can say, call my mom on Skype and it will not only open Skype, but call, you
[00:48:12.380 --> 00:48:14.020]   know, it has your Skype context.
[00:48:14.020 --> 00:48:16.700]   It'll call her.
[00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:17.700]   They did a deal with Facebook.
[00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:20.780]   You're going to get similar kind of functionality with Facebook.
[00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:22.980]   Cortana scans the email on your phone.
[00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:25.980]   See, Microsoft's been really careful.
[00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:29.340]   You know, they're going to have to stop doing the screwgirl campaign because the Gmail
[00:48:29.340 --> 00:48:30.340]   man, they read you.
[00:48:30.340 --> 00:48:31.340]   It's over.
[00:48:31.340 --> 00:48:32.340]   It's over.
[00:48:32.340 --> 00:48:38.020]   Cortana scans the email on your phone, recognizes items like flight schedules and other reservations.
[00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:40.300]   So she will remind you hate Tynoli for the airport.
[00:48:40.300 --> 00:48:43.700]   I know you're going to have to tell you it's not to show you ads.
[00:48:43.700 --> 00:48:45.700]   So oh, so that's okay.
[00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:48.540]   Well, you know, that's their argument with with screw.
[00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:52.020]   And it's also, I'm sure it, you know, the people who do the screwgirl campaigns don't
[00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:53.820]   talk to the people who develop Cortana.
[00:48:53.820 --> 00:48:57.380]   But well, they may because Mark's been the guy who did this screwgirl campaign has been
[00:48:57.380 --> 00:49:00.220]   promoted at Microsoft and is now in charge.
[00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:02.220]   What is pen in charge of digital strategy?
[00:49:02.220 --> 00:49:06.260]   All he's like in charge of strategy, I think, at Microsoft.
[00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:14.260]   So yeah, he's executive vice president, advertising and strategy.
[00:49:14.260 --> 00:49:18.100]   And you were saying earlier, you know, is it too late for Microsoft?
[00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:24.620]   I don't want to say it's never too late, but we have a tendency in the, you know, consumer
[00:49:24.620 --> 00:49:27.500]   space as consumer space watchers, mostly.
[00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:29.220]   I mean, we do a lot of enterprise.
[00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:30.220]   It's very important.
[00:49:30.220 --> 00:49:35.540]   But we have a tendency to underestimate a little bit how important and how big Microsoft
[00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:39.540]   still is in a lot of places.
[00:49:39.540 --> 00:49:47.580]   And I really don't think it's too late for Microsoft ever, you know, that they're so ubiquitous
[00:49:47.580 --> 00:49:58.020]   and have such a big presence in some of the spaces that matter that it would take a lot,
[00:49:58.020 --> 00:50:02.060]   a much longer period of screwing up for them to be out of the game.
[00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:03.060]   Now they just need to.
[00:50:03.060 --> 00:50:05.900]   But they're spending so much time on idiotic things, right?
[00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:08.100]   Like, why are you spending your time on screw gold?
[00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:12.500]   Why are you spending your time on not releasing Office for iPad?
[00:50:12.500 --> 00:50:14.660]   That's the old Microsoft.
[00:50:14.660 --> 00:50:18.260]   I think we're seeing a kinder, gentler Microsoft.
[00:50:18.260 --> 00:50:23.540]   Yes, but you can't get ahead of your competition if you're just internally messing things up
[00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:28.340]   like that, where you're putting your focus on things that are totally not improving what
[00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:32.860]   people actually like and use and want to be loyal to your company.
[00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:36.660]   And I'm thinking such in a dollar came in and said exactly that.
[00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:37.660]   Probably.
[00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:38.660]   But again, let me take you.
[00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:41.180]   Let me take the other side of the argument.
[00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:43.980]   You're just coming out with a tablet computer.
[00:50:43.980 --> 00:50:49.380]   With a brand new system with a brand new OS, it does look very strange if the next day
[00:50:49.380 --> 00:50:55.460]   you come out with the office on the iPad and you don't have the touch version of Office
[00:50:55.460 --> 00:50:57.260]   on your brand new system.
[00:50:57.260 --> 00:51:00.580]   So I'm not saying it's the right choice, but I definitely understand why they wouldn't
[00:51:00.580 --> 00:51:03.540]   want to come out with Office on the iPad immediately.
[00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:04.540]   Yeah.
[00:51:04.540 --> 00:51:07.660]   And I don't want to say that other companies don't do stupid stuff, right?
[00:51:07.660 --> 00:51:12.220]   Like, I mean, Apple is so pissed off about this whole Samsung patent thing that they're
[00:51:12.220 --> 00:51:16.580]   allowing their internal emails and strategy from not that long ago, just from a year ago
[00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:18.620]   to be exposed in court.
[00:51:18.620 --> 00:51:21.780]   I mean, companies do really, really bizarre things.
[00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:24.740]   Well, I'm very curious.
[00:51:24.740 --> 00:51:25.740]   I know.
[00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:28.860]   How much did they talk about surface at Build?
[00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:31.500]   I didn't see any mention at all.
[00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:33.300]   Maybe I just missed it.
[00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:40.460]   There wasn't a lot of it, I think, except for the run time, the universal run time.
[00:51:40.460 --> 00:51:41.460]   Yeah.
[00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:42.460]   Which is great.
[00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:43.460]   But that's for everybody.
[00:51:43.460 --> 00:51:48.380]   The fact that you can have, well, I guess that's not surface, but then those store applications
[00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:52.420]   on the desktop, there's a lot of stuff happening in there.
[00:51:52.420 --> 00:51:57.180]   But yeah, I think that what he's been saying, what Nadella said when he announced the iPad
[00:51:57.180 --> 00:52:01.980]   version of Office was that there was going to be a number of announcements in the next
[00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:04.260]   few weeks and build this part of that, of course.
[00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:10.020]   But I wouldn't be surprised if we heard a little bit more specifically about tablets
[00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:12.500]   in the near future.
[00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:14.460]   I wonder.
[00:52:14.460 --> 00:52:21.300]   I want to maybe read the tea leaves and say maybe they're backing down on the hardware.
[00:52:21.300 --> 00:52:22.300]   Who knows?
[00:52:22.300 --> 00:52:23.300]   It would be surprised.
[00:52:23.300 --> 00:52:24.300]   Yeah.
[00:52:24.300 --> 00:52:25.300]   It would be.
[00:52:25.300 --> 00:52:30.700]   Well, I asked this mythical couple who don't or may or may not host a podcast on our network.
[00:52:30.700 --> 00:52:31.700]   Why does it micro just soft?
[00:52:31.700 --> 00:52:33.020]   Just say we blew it.
[00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:34.020]   Eight was a mistake.
[00:52:34.020 --> 00:52:35.020]   We're going.
[00:52:35.020 --> 00:52:37.020]   We're going back.
[00:52:37.020 --> 00:52:39.540]   We're going back to they don't need to.
[00:52:39.540 --> 00:52:41.380]   They're making eight into seven now.
[00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:42.380]   That's what they said.
[00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:43.380]   That's a special.
[00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:46.660]   Paul and Mary Jo said they can't because all the developers ago.
[00:52:46.660 --> 00:52:47.660]   That's it.
[00:52:47.660 --> 00:52:48.660]   I'm done.
[00:52:48.660 --> 00:52:50.940]   Too many changes.
[00:52:50.940 --> 00:52:55.300]   What do people need now in eight in order to accept it?
[00:52:55.300 --> 00:52:58.340]   The start menu and they're bringing that back.
[00:52:58.340 --> 00:52:59.460]   You can boot to desktop.
[00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:00.460]   You have the start menu.
[00:53:00.460 --> 00:53:02.220]   You can run window.
[00:53:02.220 --> 00:53:10.020]   You can control everything with the mouse, including Windows Metro style applications.
[00:53:10.020 --> 00:53:13.700]   You can put them in a window on the desktop.
[00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:18.260]   Eight as a synopsis key conceived it is pretty much gone.
[00:53:18.260 --> 00:53:20.420]   I think it's safe to say.
[00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:25.820]   Liz, you cover mobile on recode and of course you have the mobile conference.
[00:53:25.820 --> 00:53:27.700]   What do you hear about Nokia and Microsoft?
[00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:30.100]   They said what next month maybe?
[00:53:30.100 --> 00:53:31.100]   Yeah.
[00:53:31.100 --> 00:53:35.140]   It's coming soon I think.
[00:53:35.140 --> 00:53:36.140]   That's going to change.
[00:53:36.140 --> 00:53:37.140]   I think that's right.
[00:53:37.140 --> 00:53:39.020]   That is going to change things.
[00:53:39.020 --> 00:53:41.780]   Maybe we are waiting for the other shoe to drop here.
[00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:44.820]   We'll give it some time.
[00:53:44.820 --> 00:53:51.100]   I mean, I look forward to seeing how those things can come together in useful way.
[00:53:51.100 --> 00:53:56.820]   I think there are still smart people who have a lot of experience selling phones who are
[00:53:56.820 --> 00:53:59.620]   trying very hard to make something interesting.
[00:53:59.620 --> 00:54:00.620]   Yeah.
[00:54:00.620 --> 00:54:05.860]   I mean, even in the course of defending Microsoft we're talking about how Cortana is just catching
[00:54:05.860 --> 00:54:06.860]   up right.
[00:54:06.860 --> 00:54:10.380]   There's more to be done.
[00:54:10.380 --> 00:54:15.580]   To enter a question about should they be giving up on Surface, I think the big problem
[00:54:15.580 --> 00:54:21.340]   is if they're not going to be building one, then probably no one is.
[00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:24.540]   They really need to keep doing it.
[00:54:24.540 --> 00:54:25.540]   They have to.
[00:54:25.540 --> 00:54:28.380]   Yeah, I guess they do.
[00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:33.780]   I think Nokia actually has some great products and the camera is phenomenal.
[00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:42.340]   Now that I've seen a one, I'm thinking maybe we don't, I was saying for a long time that
[00:54:42.340 --> 00:54:45.900]   she just did band and Windows Phone Go Android because I want to see that hardware with Android
[00:54:45.900 --> 00:54:46.900]   on it.
[00:54:46.900 --> 00:54:47.900]   Maybe we don't need to.
[00:54:47.900 --> 00:54:51.700]   Maybe Windows Phone is actually getting better and better and that cameras are good
[00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:59.620]   and maybe they've got a strong, boy from the point of view of users having three major
[00:54:59.620 --> 00:55:00.820]   choices would be great.
[00:55:00.820 --> 00:55:05.820]   Apple, Android and Windows, Microsoft.
[00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:06.820]   I'd like to see that.
[00:55:06.820 --> 00:55:08.660]   I guess who's going to join us in a little bit?
[00:55:08.660 --> 00:55:12.420]   Jeff Jarvis is just sitting around not doing anything on a Sunday afternoon.
[00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:17.220]   It was, I can't tell you, it was really hard to get people on the show and Chad and I finally
[00:55:17.220 --> 00:55:18.220]   figured out why.
[00:55:18.220 --> 00:55:21.220]   Game of Thrones.
[00:55:21.220 --> 00:55:22.740]   I could not figure it out.
[00:55:22.740 --> 00:55:24.860]   But Game of Thrones debuts tonight.
[00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:27.580]   It's also the nicest weather that San Francisco has ever had.
[00:55:27.580 --> 00:55:29.580]   It's almost 80 degrees.
[00:55:29.580 --> 00:55:30.580]   Oh, shut up.
[00:55:30.580 --> 00:55:35.420]   What's it like in very, wait a minute April and Paris.
[00:55:35.420 --> 00:55:37.260]   You got to tell me in gorgeous there, right?
[00:55:37.260 --> 00:55:41.140]   Oh, it's wonderful, but it's it's 20, 24 degree.
[00:55:41.140 --> 00:55:42.140]   What?
[00:55:42.140 --> 00:55:43.140]   But what Fahrenheit?
[00:55:43.140 --> 00:55:44.140]   No, it's obvious.
[00:55:44.140 --> 00:55:45.140]   Of course.
[00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:46.140]   I'm not using your space.
[00:55:46.140 --> 00:55:48.540]   You know, it's very nice then.
[00:55:48.540 --> 00:55:50.020]   Twenty four is perfect.
[00:55:50.020 --> 00:55:51.020]   Yes, it's wonderful.
[00:55:51.020 --> 00:55:52.580]   Wonderful in Paris right now.
[00:55:52.580 --> 00:55:53.900]   Hey, Jeff Jarvis, welcome.
[00:55:53.900 --> 00:55:54.900]   Hey, there.
[00:55:54.900 --> 00:55:55.900]   It's nice here to miss even.
[00:55:55.900 --> 00:55:56.900]   Let's see that.
[00:55:56.900 --> 00:55:58.940]   Oh, New York is beautiful too.
[00:55:58.940 --> 00:56:01.500]   But see, there's no leaves on the trees on the trees.
[00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:07.180]   No, no, no, it's barren and sad and gray.
[00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:08.180]   What is this?
[00:56:08.180 --> 00:56:12.580]   All of a sudden you're joining us in the chat room on Sundays now and the bozos of San
[00:56:12.580 --> 00:56:14.300]   Francisco here and that's the good thing.
[00:56:14.300 --> 00:56:16.500]   We don't have the the the arizots commies.
[00:56:16.500 --> 00:56:17.980]   Oh my God.
[00:56:17.980 --> 00:56:18.980]   Did you see that?
[00:56:18.980 --> 00:56:19.980]   I missed it.
[00:56:19.980 --> 00:56:21.980]   You already talked about the story and I missed it.
[00:56:21.980 --> 00:56:24.260]   We had Kevin on Kevin Rose.
[00:56:24.260 --> 00:56:30.140]   You're going to have to go back and watch the watch the on demand because Kevin, you
[00:56:30.140 --> 00:56:31.140]   know what?
[00:56:31.140 --> 00:56:33.780]   Kevin is much more gracious than I would have been.
[00:56:33.780 --> 00:56:35.180]   He is way more.
[00:56:35.180 --> 00:56:37.100]   I would I would have just gone berserk.
[00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:40.300]   Yeah, he went out and talked to him.
[00:56:40.300 --> 00:56:41.300]   Can you believe it?
[00:56:41.300 --> 00:56:42.300]   Brave man.
[00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:48.260]   Oh, and I just wanted to say about this this story in Paris, the prices have been going
[00:56:48.260 --> 00:56:50.660]   up for 10 years.
[00:56:50.660 --> 00:56:58.220]   It's getting completely crazy and we are trying as hard as we can to get the startups to the
[00:56:58.220 --> 00:57:01.060]   startup ecosystem to to take off in Paris.
[00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:07.140]   So taking no offense to this, but but Parisians are known to be even nuddier than San Francisco
[00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:10.540]   and the San Francisco are out doing them crazy right now.
[00:57:10.540 --> 00:57:11.540]   Absolutely.
[00:57:11.540 --> 00:57:15.380]   To the barricades used to be the Parisian call now it's the same to the barricades.
[00:57:15.380 --> 00:57:18.820]   Let's go barf on a bus.
[00:57:18.820 --> 00:57:23.260]   So everybody on the eve of San Francisco.
[00:57:23.260 --> 00:57:27.620]   It's funny though because I think that there's like this it's almost like internet trolling
[00:57:27.620 --> 00:57:29.220]   comments kind of come to life.
[00:57:29.220 --> 00:57:31.660]   Like I almost don't believe that.
[00:57:31.660 --> 00:57:38.900]   Look, I am from the Bay Area and I understand there's a lot of different nuances here, but
[00:57:38.900 --> 00:57:42.940]   to have someone come to your house and say that without like kind of cracking up, it's
[00:57:42.940 --> 00:57:44.700]   almost it's hard for me.
[00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:46.300]   I have to get wrapped my mind around it.
[00:57:46.300 --> 00:57:51.300]   It seems like it's the internet comment section, which which Kevin helped to set off on dig,
[00:57:51.300 --> 00:57:54.500]   you know, coming to life and like appearing in front of his house.
[00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:55.500]   It is.
[00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:56.500]   It's the ultimate trolling.
[00:57:56.500 --> 00:57:58.300]   It is the brothers who come to life.
[00:57:58.300 --> 00:58:03.740]   You already handled it, but but the one thing that I hope to see is I hope to see Liz,
[00:58:03.740 --> 00:58:09.620]   the same San Francisco's stand up and say, okay, folks, enough, enough.
[00:58:09.620 --> 00:58:14.580]   The benefit from technology being here benefit tremendously from this.
[00:58:14.580 --> 00:58:16.940]   We, you know, so some buses come by.
[00:58:16.940 --> 00:58:18.100]   Yes, prices go up.
[00:58:18.100 --> 00:58:19.100]   Welcome to capitalism.
[00:58:19.100 --> 00:58:20.180]   Welcome to the market.
[00:58:20.180 --> 00:58:23.140]   But at some point, it's really going to hurt the city.
[00:58:23.140 --> 00:58:24.300]   It's really going to harm.
[00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:27.700]   I think the image of the city and I lived in San Francisco in the days when it was known
[00:58:27.700 --> 00:58:31.820]   as nutty in the days of Jones town and other craziness and it's always been known as somewhat
[00:58:31.820 --> 00:58:35.060]   nutty, but I think this is harmful to the city.
[00:58:35.060 --> 00:58:38.620]   Yeah, I'm interested to see.
[00:58:38.620 --> 00:58:42.540]   I don't for me personally, the alarm bells are not going off yet, but no one came in
[00:58:42.540 --> 00:58:44.340]   protest at my house this morning.
[00:58:44.340 --> 00:58:49.740]   We did get some evict Ed Lee, who's our tech loving mayor graffiti on my side door
[00:58:49.740 --> 00:58:52.980]   that we had to paint over, but that's been the personal impact to me so far.
[00:58:52.980 --> 00:58:53.980]   Try me nutty.
[00:58:53.980 --> 00:58:55.500]   We're driving nuts.
[00:58:55.500 --> 00:59:00.140]   I am very sympathetic to people who are getting evicted or getting pushed out of their neighborhoods
[00:59:00.140 --> 00:59:02.180]   that live there their whole lives, all of that stuff.
[00:59:02.180 --> 00:59:04.020]   That's that's sad and that's not right.
[00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:07.980]   I don't think you can blame Google Google or Yahoo or anybody for that.
[00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:08.980]   And would you rather do without?
[00:59:08.980 --> 00:59:10.340]   Would you rather be Des Moines?
[00:59:10.340 --> 00:59:11.340]   Would you rather be Detroit?
[00:59:11.340 --> 00:59:18.700]   What scares me more than anything is this just this notion that I feel like it's a backlash
[00:59:18.700 --> 00:59:21.060]   against technology in general.
[00:59:21.060 --> 00:59:24.380]   It goes along with the privacy issues and all that.
[00:59:24.380 --> 00:59:30.740]   I really fear that there may be a Luddite backlash in the making and that scares me
[00:59:30.740 --> 00:59:33.180]   because that would not be good.
[00:59:33.180 --> 00:59:34.180]   I don't want to.
[00:59:34.180 --> 00:59:35.180]   I think you're right, Leo.
[00:59:35.180 --> 00:59:36.180]   I think there's two things going on.
[00:59:36.180 --> 00:59:40.060]   The technology backlash, the other one's an economic backlash.
[00:59:40.060 --> 00:59:43.060]   There is a technology, one percent being created.
[00:59:43.060 --> 00:59:48.740]   As jobs are eliminated, there's higher profitability, higher productivity, higher greater wealth
[00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:50.860]   being created in Silicon Valley.
[00:59:50.860 --> 00:59:54.140]   That's an issue that Silicon Valley has to figure out how to deal with.
[00:59:54.140 --> 00:59:59.820]   Well, I guess in coming in quality is a major issue and you get to go too far.
[00:59:59.820 --> 01:00:04.700]   You know that, Patrick, back in the 1789, these things go bad.
[01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:06.300]   They don't end well.
[01:00:06.300 --> 01:00:10.580]   I don't think we're quite there yet, but yes, let's keep our eye on the situation.
[01:00:10.580 --> 01:00:16.020]   When they build a guillotine in Union Square, then I'll know it troubles a Bruin.
[01:00:16.020 --> 01:00:18.540]   Meanwhile, let's go to Union Square.
[01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:20.340]   They don't go there.
[01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:23.540]   No, no, nobody there.
[01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:24.620]   Now I would protest there.
[01:00:24.620 --> 01:00:25.780]   Go protest them in Marcus.
[01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:29.020]   Now you want to protest something, protest them in Marcus.
[01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:31.620]   Our show today brought to you by Jeff Stickaround.
[01:00:31.620 --> 01:00:32.620]   Yeah?
[01:00:32.620 --> 01:00:33.620]   Sure.
[01:00:33.620 --> 01:00:34.620]   Can you give us a minute?
[01:00:34.620 --> 01:00:36.860]   I was probably just going to go out for a healthy walk.
[01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:38.740]   I'd rather be here or I'd wait with you.
[01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:41.140]   This is so much better than exercise.
[01:00:41.140 --> 01:00:43.900]   I have a topic for Jeff after the...
[01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:44.900]   Good.
[01:00:44.900 --> 01:00:50.500]   Patrick is going to give you a topic to be expound upon.
[01:00:50.500 --> 01:00:55.460]   Ladies and gentlemen, it is my great pleasure and privilege to talk to you about Go to Meeting.
[01:00:55.460 --> 01:01:01.820]   Our friends at Citrix have created a fabulous way to stay in touch, to meet with, to collaborate
[01:01:01.820 --> 01:01:06.300]   with coworkers and clients, anywhere they are, anywhere you are.
[01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:10.500]   It's so important to build a strong relationship with your team.
[01:01:10.500 --> 01:01:16.460]   Your team, I should say, meet and collaborate with coworkers and clients on a regular basis
[01:01:16.460 --> 01:01:19.460]   to brainstorm, develop quality ideas and solutions.
[01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:23.140]   You've got to do it in a meeting, but you don't have to all be together.
[01:01:23.140 --> 01:01:28.140]   With Go to Meeting, you can get everybody in the same room, in effect.
[01:01:28.140 --> 01:01:29.940]   You're on the same page, sharing your screen.
[01:01:29.940 --> 01:01:33.980]   You're seeing each other face to face over Go to Meeting with HD faces.
[01:01:33.980 --> 01:01:35.420]   It is fabulous.
[01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:36.940]   Look at this.
[01:01:36.940 --> 01:01:38.100]   This is really cool.

[01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:49.020]   They're always trying new stuff at Go to Meeting.
[01:01:49.020 --> 01:01:51.260]   I'm wondering if this is using WebRTC.
[01:01:51.260 --> 01:01:52.620]   We've got to check this out.
[01:01:52.620 --> 01:01:54.740]   This is really cool.

[01:02:28.780 --> 01:02:31.020]   That is awesome.
[01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:35.780]   Go to Meeting.com on mobile and iPad on iPhone.
[01:02:35.780 --> 01:02:38.700]   Desktop on laptop on Android.
[01:02:38.700 --> 01:02:39.700]   It's all there.
[01:02:39.700 --> 01:02:40.700]   All right.
[01:02:40.700 --> 01:02:44.020]   Patrick Bejah is here, not Patrick on the Twitter.
[01:02:44.020 --> 01:02:47.460]   PatrickBejah.com list gains from...
[01:02:47.460 --> 01:02:48.980]   I always ask you, Gans are gains.
[01:02:48.980 --> 01:02:49.980]   What do you like?
[01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:50.980]   Gans.
[01:02:50.980 --> 01:02:51.980]   Your dad used gains.
[01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:52.980]   Rhymes with brains.
[01:02:52.980 --> 01:02:53.980]   Gans, rhymes with brains.
[01:02:53.980 --> 01:02:55.980]   That's the answer you gave me last time.
[01:02:55.980 --> 01:02:58.060]   Recode.net.
[01:02:58.060 --> 01:03:04.500]   And I mentioned it before, but I go back a ways with the Liz's dad's two gains.
[01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:05.500]   That's right.
[01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:06.500]   And it's nice to work with his daughter.
[01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:07.500]   That's so cool.
[01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:08.500]   Yeah.
[01:03:08.500 --> 01:03:09.500]   I'm glad you...
[01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:11.660]   I'm trying to get him to come watch basketball to meet with me tonight.
[01:03:11.660 --> 01:03:14.180]   The Stanford's Women's Basketball is in the final four.
[01:03:14.180 --> 01:03:15.740]   Oh, how exciting.
[01:03:15.740 --> 01:03:16.740]   So maybe I'll see him later.
[01:03:16.740 --> 01:03:17.740]   Are you an alumna?
[01:03:17.740 --> 01:03:20.860]   No, no, but growing up in Palo Alto, you...
[01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:22.700]   It's kind of a fun thing to go out for.
[01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:23.700]   Yeah.
[01:03:23.700 --> 01:03:24.700]   Yeah.
[01:03:24.700 --> 01:03:29.060]   The women haven't won the NCAA since I was growing up in Palo Alto.
[01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:30.700]   That was the time.
[01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:31.700]   So, yeah.
[01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:33.100]   Looking for a win.
[01:03:33.100 --> 01:03:34.100]   Yeah.
[01:03:34.100 --> 01:03:35.100]   Huskies in there.
[01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:36.100]   I mean, this is exciting.
[01:03:36.100 --> 01:03:37.100]   This is exciting time.
[01:03:37.100 --> 01:03:39.100]   I don't follow this stuff at all.
[01:03:39.100 --> 01:03:40.100]   I just, you know...
[01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:41.100]   No, just, you know...
[01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:42.100]   I have to pretend I know sport ball.
[01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:45.340]   As I always say, Leo, I'm neither a real man nor a real American.
[01:03:45.340 --> 01:03:46.340]   I don't know sport.
[01:03:46.340 --> 01:03:49.940]   Okay, you're not a real man because you're not in a sports, but what's the American part?
[01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:50.940]   You like...
[01:03:50.940 --> 01:03:51.940]   What?
[01:03:51.940 --> 01:03:53.180]   Oh, you like freedom fries?
[01:03:53.180 --> 01:03:54.180]   Sports, okay.
[01:03:54.180 --> 01:03:56.780]   Sports, I don't know sports, I don't know.
[01:03:56.780 --> 01:03:58.820]   So Patrick, you have a challenge.
[01:03:58.820 --> 01:04:02.020]   Jeff Jarvis is also here, by the way, normally host of This Week in Google.
[01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:03.700]   We can't keep him away.
[01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:05.820]   It's so nice to have you on a Sunday afternoon.
[01:04:05.820 --> 01:04:06.820]   Thank you, Jeff, for joining us.
[01:04:06.820 --> 01:04:10.980]   He is with the Professor of Journalism at the City University of New York.
[01:04:10.980 --> 01:04:13.260]   He is also a really accomplished author.
[01:04:13.260 --> 01:04:14.260]   His latest public...
[01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:15.260]   You are the plugmeister.
[01:04:15.260 --> 01:04:19.300]   I'd like to get the plugs in because you guys have been here for free, so...
[01:04:19.300 --> 01:04:20.300]   I gotta give you something.
[01:04:20.300 --> 01:04:22.500]   I gotta give you something in return.
[01:04:22.500 --> 01:04:24.460]   He actually stirns the plugmeister.
[01:04:24.460 --> 01:04:25.460]   Yes.
[01:04:25.460 --> 01:04:28.740]   But he saves it for the last 10 minutes of the show.
[01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:29.740]   Yeah.
[01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:32.860]   Nobody's listening at 10 o'clock.
[01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:35.180]   So I like to stick my plugs in earlier.
[01:04:35.180 --> 01:04:37.460]   So you had a... Patrick, you had a...
[01:04:37.460 --> 01:04:38.460]   Sorry.
[01:04:38.460 --> 01:04:40.260]   Oh, that's funny.
[01:04:40.260 --> 01:04:41.420]   Wait a minute.
[01:04:41.420 --> 01:04:44.540]   Jeff says, "Did you already do the audible ad?
[01:04:44.540 --> 01:04:45.980]   I was just signing up again."
[01:04:45.980 --> 01:04:46.980]   It's true.
[01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:48.620]   That's why I was watching the show.
[01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:52.020]   I was basically signing up again because I realized I was buying three books and I said,
[01:04:52.020 --> 01:04:53.020]   "This is stupid."
[01:04:53.020 --> 01:04:54.420]   Yeah, you need some stuff for the book.
[01:04:54.420 --> 01:04:55.420]   What books are you buying?
[01:04:55.420 --> 01:04:56.420]   What books are you buying?
[01:04:56.420 --> 01:05:02.860]   I'm trying to get a complimentary membership or something.
[01:05:02.860 --> 01:05:03.860]   No, I should.
[01:05:03.860 --> 01:05:04.860]   I should.
[01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:05.860]   Good worth of geeks only.
[01:05:05.860 --> 01:05:09.500]   And I have just finished seeing the island at the center of the world or whatever it's
[01:05:09.500 --> 01:05:11.540]   called, "Russel's Shortos History of Manhattan."
[01:05:11.540 --> 01:05:12.540]   It's wonderful.
[01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:13.540]   Oh, I like that.
[01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:14.540]   I like that.
[01:05:14.540 --> 01:05:16.540]   Red before that, "Russel's Shortos History of Amsterdam."
[01:05:16.540 --> 01:05:20.380]   As the great liberal city, it is just magnificent.
[01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:23.380]   And I just bought the biography of money.
[01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:26.340]   Wow, you are an intellectual.
[01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:28.140]   No, I just need something while I walk.
[01:05:28.140 --> 01:05:29.140]   This sounds good.
[01:05:29.140 --> 01:05:30.900]   The island at the center of the world.
[01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:31.900]   It's great.
[01:05:31.900 --> 01:05:36.660]   It is just, there's a guy named, sorry, Adriane van der Donck.
[01:05:36.660 --> 01:05:38.860]   Those Dutch.
[01:05:38.860 --> 01:05:43.540]   I really want to start a Kickstarter campaign tomorrow to build a statue for Adriane van
[01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:44.540]   der Donck.
[01:05:44.540 --> 01:05:48.060]   If van der Donck hadn't done it, there'd be no Manhattan.
[01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:49.060]   Right.
[01:05:49.060 --> 01:05:55.060]   Adriane van der Donck is really one of the fathers, unheralded fathers of the American
[01:05:55.060 --> 01:06:02.860]   way of life, of independence and equality and self-government.
[01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:04.500]   And I'm just amazed by this.
[01:06:04.500 --> 01:06:06.060]   And you ever heard of--
[01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:07.260]   Never heard of them.
[01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:09.260]   --on the van der Donck?
[01:06:09.260 --> 01:06:10.460]   Never heard of the van der Donck.
[01:06:10.460 --> 01:06:12.460]   Mr. van der Donck is amazing.
[01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:17.020]   So I'm inspired by Adriane van der Donck.
[01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:22.180]   Right now across America, people are going to Wikipedia and find out who the hell is Adriane.
[01:06:22.180 --> 01:06:23.780]   Just get that book.
[01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:24.780]   Just get that book.
[01:06:24.780 --> 01:06:25.780]   It's good.
[01:06:25.780 --> 01:06:26.780]   It's very good.
[01:06:26.780 --> 01:06:27.780]   And so it's very good.
[01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:28.780]   I listened to the whole thing on Audible.
[01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:32.820]   I'm at the last exciting minutes just as the British are about to take over Manhattan.
[01:06:32.820 --> 01:06:35.220]   And I'm rooting for the Dutch to win myself.
[01:06:35.220 --> 01:06:36.220]   Sorry.
[01:06:36.220 --> 01:06:38.060]   Spoiler alert.
[01:06:38.060 --> 01:06:40.060]   John.
[01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:45.300]   Some Patrick, you had something to pose, Jeff.
[01:06:45.300 --> 01:06:50.300]   Yeah, I just wanted to gloat a little bit.
[01:06:50.300 --> 01:06:51.300]   Oh, no.
[01:06:51.300 --> 01:06:56.020]   And also get Jeff's take on this topic.
[01:06:56.020 --> 01:07:02.740]   You're aware, I'm sure, of the European Parliament passing very strong net neutrality laws this week.
[01:07:02.740 --> 01:07:04.300]   Good topic, Patrick.
[01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:05.300]   Thank you.
[01:07:05.300 --> 01:07:07.140]   I thought you'd like it.
[01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:10.580]   Tell me what they did because I did not know this.
[01:07:10.580 --> 01:07:13.380]   Being a provincial American.
[01:07:13.380 --> 01:07:20.740]   So basically, the European Parliament had a very important vote on net neutrality.
[01:07:20.740 --> 01:07:22.740]   I believe it was this week.
[01:07:22.740 --> 01:07:23.740]   It was.
[01:07:23.740 --> 01:07:24.740]   It was.
[01:07:24.740 --> 01:07:25.740]   Yeah, last week, obviously.
[01:07:25.740 --> 01:07:26.740]   Sorry.
[01:07:26.740 --> 01:07:27.740]   The nearly cruel.
[01:07:27.740 --> 01:07:43.340]   And yeah, nearly crows had a somewhat semi-controversial text before the Parliament, but then a number of very active left-wing parliament.
[01:07:43.340 --> 01:08:13.340]   So, I think the government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's government's
[01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:18.220]   Create special channels for certain deals that they would want to make.
[01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:19.220]   All of that is gone.
[01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:25.700]   And what remains is a text that makes it that enforces net neutrality in all of Europe.
[01:08:25.700 --> 01:08:29.300]   And that's absolutely amazing.
[01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:30.940]   We didn't think it was going to happen like this.
[01:08:30.940 --> 01:08:35.300]   And it was the best news of the year for people like us.
[01:08:35.300 --> 01:08:37.340]   So I salute you.
[01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:40.420]   I sometimes make fun of my European friends.
[01:08:40.420 --> 01:08:42.900]   I sometimes make fun of the EU.
[01:08:42.900 --> 01:08:43.900]   I am wrong.
[01:08:43.900 --> 01:08:46.900]   I salute you.
[01:08:46.900 --> 01:08:47.900]   Excellent legislation.
[01:08:47.900 --> 01:08:52.820]   As Patrick said, the law came in when it was done with all the EU politics.
[01:08:52.820 --> 01:08:54.340]   Had a lot of exceptions.
[01:08:54.340 --> 01:08:58.260]   And as Patrick said, all the left-wing people pulled one by one amendments to pull the exceptions
[01:08:58.260 --> 01:08:59.260]   out.
[01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:04.380]   And it is real net neutrality legislation in the EU.
[01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:08.820]   And it's it leaves us in America in the dust.
[01:09:08.820 --> 01:09:09.820]   Wow.
[01:09:09.820 --> 01:09:14.500]   Now, tell me a little bit because I'm ignorant American.
[01:09:14.500 --> 01:09:18.660]   This has the force of law everywhere in the EU.
[01:09:18.660 --> 01:09:19.660]   Everybody has to adhere to this.
[01:09:19.660 --> 01:09:21.020]   What is the enforcement?
[01:09:21.020 --> 01:09:22.620]   How does it work?
[01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:25.100]   It needs to be adapted to each country.
[01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:30.660]   But essentially, yes, it needs to it has to be adapted in every country that's a member
[01:09:30.660 --> 01:09:32.460]   of the union.
[01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:34.460]   So it has force of law.
[01:09:34.460 --> 01:09:42.220]   It comes in opposition of certain rules that people were thinking about putting in place
[01:09:42.220 --> 01:09:46.620]   to counteract Netflix coming in France, for example.
[01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:51.180]   There were a number of those special services that people wanted to implement.
[01:09:51.180 --> 01:09:55.620]   But yeah, it's essentially law within the next few months unless something incredible
[01:09:55.620 --> 01:09:58.860]   happens that I'm not aware that could happen.
[01:09:58.860 --> 01:10:02.100]   It is now law and net neutrality as we think of it.
[01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:07.580]   And that's very important because a lot of people have been starting to sort of you know,
[01:10:07.580 --> 01:10:12.060]   to try and rebrand net neutrality, to try and say, yes, okay, you need to be neutral.
[01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:15.900]   But if you have this case or this case, then you can make exceptions.
[01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:19.780]   But that's not the way the law was passed.
[01:10:19.780 --> 01:10:27.100]   So yeah, again, it's it's law in all of the member states of the union.
[01:10:27.100 --> 01:10:30.940]   Yeah, the reason we know what's good is because for big telecommunications companies, according
[01:10:30.940 --> 01:10:35.340]   to Michael Furtick piece in Forbes, condemned the legislation.
[01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:37.900]   So that's how we do it.
[01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:39.860]   It could never happen here.
[01:10:39.860 --> 01:10:45.100]   You know, it's so funny because I was watching TV three just the other day.
[01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:50.940]   And and I saw, well, let me see if I can find it here.
[01:10:50.940 --> 01:10:51.940]   TV three.
[01:10:51.940 --> 01:10:54.020]   Yeah, in France.
[01:10:54.020 --> 01:10:55.020]   And I was.
[01:10:55.020 --> 01:10:57.020]   It was so good.
[01:10:57.020 --> 01:10:58.820]   French, maybe.
[01:10:58.820 --> 01:11:00.820]   Is that what they call it now?
[01:11:00.820 --> 01:11:02.700]   Oh, I love hearing you say that.
[01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:03.700]   So.
[01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:09.740]   I can say names of cheese later if you want.
[01:11:09.740 --> 01:11:12.220]   Do you just listen?
[01:11:12.220 --> 01:11:14.380]   It'll be so fun.
[01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:22.500]   The really the really weird thing was that the law initially was basically tailored to
[01:11:22.500 --> 01:11:29.380]   speech and to cable providers, and I'm not sure exactly what happened, but within two
[01:11:29.380 --> 01:11:32.140]   days it completely changed and it passed.
[01:11:32.140 --> 01:11:34.620]   It was very strange.
[01:11:34.620 --> 01:11:40.460]   And of course, in the in light of what happened in the US a couple of months ago with the
[01:11:40.460 --> 01:11:45.980]   net neutrality being not debunked, but rejected.
[01:11:45.980 --> 01:11:51.540]   Now that's very I think I so to make it a little bit more global.
[01:11:51.540 --> 01:11:58.260]   I do think that is going to make it a little bit more difficult for other countries to.
[01:11:58.260 --> 01:12:01.260]   To reject net.
[01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:02.900]   Who are their customers?
[01:12:02.900 --> 01:12:04.700]   Well, this is it.
[01:12:04.700 --> 01:12:06.820]   That's what Francois right?
[01:12:06.820 --> 01:12:08.620]   I think this is it.
[01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:09.620]   Yeah.
[01:12:09.620 --> 01:12:10.620]   Yeah.
[01:12:10.620 --> 01:12:11.620]   Yeah.
[01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:12.620]   Layshian.
[01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:13.620]   Or you're just showing off.
[01:12:13.620 --> 01:12:14.620]   The international.
[01:12:14.620 --> 01:12:15.620]   Mr.
[01:12:15.620 --> 01:12:16.620]   Cosmopolitan.
[01:12:16.620 --> 01:12:17.620]   Get blue.
[01:12:17.620 --> 01:12:18.620]   Okay.
[01:12:18.620 --> 01:12:20.980]   I love you.
[01:12:20.980 --> 01:12:21.980]   I love you.
[01:12:21.980 --> 01:12:22.980]   Tell me.
[01:12:22.980 --> 01:12:24.860]   Don't you mean, Miss Ellen?
[01:12:24.860 --> 01:12:26.580]   You sweet, fun, smart.
[01:12:26.580 --> 01:12:28.620]   Sweet, okay, baby.
[01:12:28.620 --> 01:12:31.020]   I even understand it, which is great.
[01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:32.020]   Absolutely.
[01:12:32.020 --> 01:12:34.660]   But listen, what are you?
[01:12:34.660 --> 01:12:36.460]   Oh, well.
[01:12:36.460 --> 01:12:37.700]   Stewart.
[01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:39.300]   Did you see this?
[01:12:39.300 --> 01:12:43.020]   I just know.
[01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:45.580]   This is Saturday Night Live.
[01:12:45.580 --> 01:12:49.460]   This is the French dance.
[01:12:49.460 --> 01:12:51.740]   What's the new sprockets?
[01:12:51.740 --> 01:12:55.300]   It's the new sprockets.
[01:12:55.300 --> 01:12:57.340]   I'm sorry we're going to get banned from YouTube now.
[01:12:57.340 --> 01:13:03.180]   This is all in coverage of the new French net neutrality law.
[01:13:03.180 --> 01:13:04.980]   Completely appropriate.
[01:13:04.980 --> 01:13:05.980]   Okay.
[01:13:05.980 --> 01:13:07.980]   Enough of that.
[01:13:07.980 --> 01:13:09.980]   You know, it's so sad.
[01:13:09.980 --> 01:13:15.540]   It's like I was trying to look up the all the Saturday live skits from last week.
[01:13:15.540 --> 01:13:17.420]   Last night, of which that was one.
[01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:19.620]   And you can't see that was like only one.
[01:13:19.620 --> 01:13:21.540]   That was one of the only ones that you could actually find.
[01:13:21.540 --> 01:13:22.540]   I know.
[01:13:22.540 --> 01:13:26.700]   Because the bunch of the music is anacondric as a singer, so they used a bunch of music
[01:13:26.700 --> 01:13:27.860]   for skits.
[01:13:27.860 --> 01:13:30.340]   And it's just like, I don't know the rights.
[01:13:30.340 --> 01:13:31.340]   They don't have the rights.
[01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:32.340]   They show it on TV, but not online.
[01:13:32.340 --> 01:13:33.340]   I know.
[01:13:33.340 --> 01:13:34.340]   I know they don't have the rights.
[01:13:34.340 --> 01:13:35.840]   It just seems stupid.
[01:13:35.840 --> 01:13:37.380]   Turkey lifts the Twitter ban.
[01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:39.100]   Apparently it was illegal.
[01:13:39.100 --> 01:13:40.740]   This is why.
[01:13:40.740 --> 01:13:44.180]   And the YouTube ban violates human rights.
[01:13:44.180 --> 01:13:45.180]   Yay.
[01:13:45.180 --> 01:13:52.980]   So this is why you don't want to try to shut down the internet in a democratic republic.
[01:13:52.980 --> 01:13:59.900]   Just people, you know, there's other, there's a court limits restrictions to 15 videos on
[01:13:59.900 --> 01:14:02.140]   YouTube.
[01:14:02.140 --> 01:14:05.140]   That was right after the ruling that scrapped the ban on Twitter.
[01:14:05.140 --> 01:14:14.780]   So it was the Turkish prime minister, Erdogan, who has been trying to shut down social media.
[01:14:14.780 --> 01:14:19.620]   Apparently because it carries stuff that's unflattering to his government.
[01:14:19.620 --> 01:14:23.980]   And he was coming up with great, there were some great, great memes online, pictures of
[01:14:23.980 --> 01:14:29.860]   him with ridiculous statements of his about the net and Twitter and how Twitter is evil
[01:14:29.860 --> 01:14:30.860]   and awful.
[01:14:30.860 --> 01:14:33.580]   Well, there you go.
[01:14:33.580 --> 01:14:37.220]   Victory in Turkey so far anyway.
[01:14:37.220 --> 01:14:44.140]   And it's kind of interesting to think that he's banning them and he's got this image of dictator
[01:14:44.140 --> 01:14:48.660]   almost, you know, to, to people, to a lot of people who probably hear of him for the first
[01:14:48.660 --> 01:14:50.700]   time with, with this.
[01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:52.380]   And then the court says he can't do it.
[01:14:52.380 --> 01:14:53.900]   And he's like, Oh, right.
[01:14:53.900 --> 01:14:54.900]   Okay.
[01:14:54.900 --> 01:14:55.900]   Well, I guess we won't do it.
[01:14:55.900 --> 01:14:56.900]   Never mind.
[01:14:56.900 --> 01:14:57.900]   It's.
[01:14:57.900 --> 01:15:01.100]   But I'll tell you one thing you can't do in this country and you can't take a selfie with
[01:15:01.100 --> 01:15:04.940]   the president of the United States using a Samsung phone.
[01:15:04.940 --> 01:15:08.340]   That's not exactly what happened.
[01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:14.060]   David Ortiz, a Red Sox ballplayer, apparently has a deal with Samsung.
[01:15:14.060 --> 01:15:23.380]   And took a selfie with the president in which the Samsung Galaxy Note 3 was, I think, fairly
[01:15:23.380 --> 01:15:27.380]   prominently revealed very much like Ellen's selfie.
[01:15:27.380 --> 01:15:31.860]   The White House said the president's legal team objects to the company's commercial use
[01:15:31.860 --> 01:15:33.700]   of the photograph.
[01:15:33.700 --> 01:15:35.660]   He is a public figure was done in public.
[01:15:35.660 --> 01:15:36.660]   Yeah.
[01:15:36.660 --> 01:15:38.060]   And it's not a selfie.
[01:15:38.060 --> 01:15:39.060]   That's the problem.
[01:15:39.060 --> 01:15:41.460]   It's that someone took a picture of the picture, right?
[01:15:41.460 --> 01:15:42.460]   Taking.
[01:15:42.460 --> 01:15:43.460]   Oh, okay.
[01:15:43.460 --> 01:15:44.460]   Yeah, because it isn't that's right.
[01:15:44.460 --> 01:15:45.460]   They're not transmitting the selfie.
[01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:46.460]   The selfie.
[01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:49.060]   They like sponsored by Samsung on it.
[01:15:49.060 --> 01:15:50.060]   That is in the selfie.
[01:15:50.060 --> 01:15:54.860]   Of course, Samsung tweets the picture of the selfie.
[01:15:54.860 --> 01:15:58.860]   And of course, another home run for Samsung.
[01:15:58.860 --> 01:15:59.860]   Social media.
[01:15:59.860 --> 01:16:01.260]   Here's my prediction.
[01:16:01.260 --> 01:16:02.260]   Yeah.
[01:16:02.260 --> 01:16:05.260]   My prediction is the next one, the Pope.
[01:16:05.260 --> 01:16:07.460]   Oh, I think we can arrange that.
[01:16:07.460 --> 01:16:08.460]   Yeah, I think it's going to happen.
[01:16:08.460 --> 01:16:09.460]   I know the Pope's.
[01:16:09.460 --> 01:16:11.380]   Samsung, Samsung is heading to Rome.
[01:16:11.380 --> 01:16:12.940]   I'm betting on the Pope.
[01:16:12.940 --> 01:16:16.660]   So the video, here's the video of the of the scene at the White House.
[01:16:16.660 --> 01:16:18.620]   Looks like it might fit him better than me, though.
[01:16:18.620 --> 01:16:27.820]   Ortiz gives Obama his own Red Sox jersey and then whips out his conveniently placed Samsung
[01:16:27.820 --> 01:16:29.180]   smartphone.
[01:16:29.180 --> 01:16:31.180]   Big poppy selfie.
[01:16:31.180 --> 01:16:32.180]   Big poppy selfie.
[01:16:32.180 --> 01:16:33.180]   Big poppies.
[01:16:33.180 --> 01:16:37.580]   You know that note three looks kind of small and big poppy's hand.
[01:16:37.580 --> 01:16:39.500]   That's the guy that phone was designed for.
[01:16:39.500 --> 01:16:41.460]   I think they made the right deal on that one.
[01:16:41.460 --> 01:16:43.380]   Yeah, I guess the White House is objecting.
[01:16:43.380 --> 01:16:44.380]   But what are you?
[01:16:44.380 --> 01:16:45.380]   What are you going to do?
[01:16:45.380 --> 01:16:46.380]   50 grand.
[01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:47.380]   Yeah.
[01:16:47.380 --> 01:16:48.380]   What are you going to do?
[01:16:48.380 --> 01:16:49.380]   Huh?
[01:16:49.380 --> 01:16:53.340]   Wait, you can wear that suit, but you cannot take a selfie with the president.
[01:16:53.340 --> 01:16:54.860]   That suit is quite something.
[01:16:54.860 --> 01:16:58.940]   For those listening, I don't know which Red Sox that is, but he's wearing a an American
[01:16:58.940 --> 01:17:00.100]   flag suit.
[01:17:00.100 --> 01:17:02.620]   In my day, you're a young champ.
[01:17:02.620 --> 01:17:05.980]   You honestly could have been arrested for for desperation of the flag.
[01:17:05.980 --> 01:17:06.980]   That's I agree.
[01:17:06.980 --> 01:17:10.580]   Well, that's thanks to that liberal Supreme Court now.
[01:17:10.580 --> 01:17:13.180]   Anything goes with our American flag.
[01:17:13.180 --> 01:17:21.100]   Hey, speaking of SCOTUS, of course it was this week that the Supreme Court entirely disenfranchised
[01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:27.660]   all Americans by saying there is no limit to the amount of money you can donate a corporation
[01:17:27.660 --> 01:17:32.260]   or or individual could donate to your limited per candidate, but you're not now limited
[01:17:32.260 --> 01:17:33.260]   in total.
[01:17:33.260 --> 01:17:36.060]   You say you can donate to every damn Republican across the country.
[01:17:36.060 --> 01:17:37.060]   Right.
[01:17:37.060 --> 01:17:43.300]   Or using a variety of different packs and interest groups.
[01:17:43.300 --> 01:17:45.580]   You can just go the sky's the limit.
[01:17:45.580 --> 01:17:47.460]   Go have fun.
[01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:48.460]   Knock yourself out.
[01:17:48.460 --> 01:17:51.100]   What do you think of that, Jeff?
[01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:53.980]   Let me just ask Jeff Jarvis off the top of his head.
[01:17:53.980 --> 01:17:55.700]   What do you think of that?
[01:17:55.700 --> 01:18:03.460]   I agree with Larry Lessig that money is is unbelievably corrupting to our legislative
[01:18:03.460 --> 01:18:05.140]   and government branches.
[01:18:05.140 --> 01:18:09.500]   I believe it's the root of our mess.
[01:18:09.500 --> 01:18:12.340]   I don't think the companies are people and have rights.
[01:18:12.340 --> 01:18:23.500]   However, at some point in a media economy that's built on buying TV time, artificial
[01:18:23.500 --> 01:18:25.580]   limits are difficult to put forward.
[01:18:25.580 --> 01:18:27.420]   So I don't think the solution is trying to limit the money.
[01:18:27.420 --> 01:18:33.660]   I think the solution is not having five year campaigns, but I don't know how you do that.
[01:18:33.660 --> 01:18:38.900]   I do feel like we're on our way to a plutocracy where the rich get to buy Congress and buy
[01:18:38.900 --> 01:18:39.900]   it.
[01:18:39.900 --> 01:18:41.180]   But there is a solution to this.
[01:18:41.180 --> 01:18:44.940]   There's a tech angle to this, frankly, which is why I bring it up.
[01:18:44.940 --> 01:18:45.940]   There is a solution to this.
[01:18:45.940 --> 01:18:48.620]   Really, what they're buying with all that money is votes.
[01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:50.140]   They're buying ads.
[01:18:50.140 --> 01:18:53.340]   They're buying influence.
[01:18:53.340 --> 01:18:57.340]   But ultimately, the voter still controls who's in Congress.
[01:18:57.340 --> 01:19:02.460]   And I think the internet offers a real alternative to making your decision about who to vote
[01:19:02.460 --> 01:19:05.700]   for from television commercials.
[01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:10.180]   So, maybe now there is no limit on.
[01:19:10.180 --> 01:19:11.180]   But here's the question.
[01:19:11.180 --> 01:19:14.660]   The amount of money you can donate to a campaign, but folks, there is an opportunity to figure
[01:19:14.660 --> 01:19:18.980]   out who you like and who you don't like by going on the internet and doing your research
[01:19:18.980 --> 01:19:21.500]   and then voting.
[01:19:21.500 --> 01:19:27.740]   The key here is to me, we're only going to end the hegemony of television in this country.
[01:19:27.740 --> 01:19:30.900]   I mean, it doesn't happen in Europe because you are limited to what you can spend on campaigns
[01:19:30.900 --> 01:19:32.180]   and the campaigns are short.
[01:19:32.180 --> 01:19:35.540]   So once again, I salute Europe.
[01:19:35.540 --> 01:19:42.580]   But in this country, Mark Andreessen was talking about in Twitter, he went off on another Twitter
[01:19:42.580 --> 01:19:47.340]   rant saying, "But even poor people all have one vote, so how do they limit this?"
[01:19:47.340 --> 01:19:51.500]   But clearly, there's money spent that has an impact on opinion, that hasn't been put
[01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:52.500]   on everything.
[01:19:52.500 --> 01:19:53.420]   The question is this.
[01:19:53.420 --> 01:20:01.220]   The first person who's elected to, let's say, Congress by the internet without television,
[01:20:01.220 --> 01:20:02.220]   that's when the revolution struck.
[01:20:02.220 --> 01:20:03.220]   Right.
[01:20:03.220 --> 01:20:04.220]   And we're nowhere near that.
[01:20:04.220 --> 01:20:05.220]   We are nowhere near that.
[01:20:05.220 --> 01:20:06.740]   Everybody still gets elected by television.
[01:20:06.740 --> 01:20:10.220]   But if you could possibly use the internet to get elected, that makes the internet an
[01:20:10.220 --> 01:20:12.060]   equally powerful tool.
[01:20:12.060 --> 01:20:13.060]   And don't say that.
[01:20:13.060 --> 01:20:16.860]   So what you're saying is that we need the Justin Bieber of Congress.
[01:20:16.860 --> 01:20:19.420]   You know, well, you could make the case that-
[01:20:19.420 --> 01:20:20.820]   Yeah, well, we don't forget.
[01:20:20.820 --> 01:20:27.540]   We had Gopher from Love Boat, we're probably to say in this country, and Sonny Bono.
[01:20:27.540 --> 01:20:34.260]   Yeah, yeah, but then again, you have a head of state who's having affairs around and
[01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:37.260]   nobody thinks it's a big deal, which I think is pretty cool.
[01:20:37.260 --> 01:20:39.100]   From Swah-Holland for Congress.
[01:20:39.100 --> 01:20:40.100]   Yes, that's right.
[01:20:40.100 --> 01:20:42.460]   That's what we're managing to achieve.
[01:20:42.460 --> 01:20:44.460]   Yes, I usually proud.
[01:20:44.460 --> 01:20:45.460]   We are.
[01:20:45.460 --> 01:20:50.860]   I would just say, I know a lot of techies is very fashionable among geeks to say, "Oh,
[01:20:50.860 --> 01:20:52.220]   your vote doesn't count.
[01:20:52.220 --> 01:20:55.220]   You're participating in a corrupt system.
[01:20:55.220 --> 01:20:56.660]   I'm not going to get involved."
[01:20:56.660 --> 01:21:01.380]   Your vote does count if you think it's a corrupt system of vote, because if you don't vote,
[01:21:01.380 --> 01:21:04.020]   it is guarantee you it will be a corrupt system.
[01:21:04.020 --> 01:21:05.660]   And you know how much it counts?
[01:21:05.660 --> 01:21:09.220]   It counts exactly as much as everyone else's.
[01:21:09.220 --> 01:21:10.220]   Yeah.
[01:21:10.220 --> 01:21:11.660]   That's the idea of the thing.
[01:21:11.660 --> 01:21:13.660]   So yes, it does count.
[01:21:13.660 --> 01:21:16.180]   And this from a Frenchman.
[01:21:16.180 --> 01:21:18.180]   [laughter]
[01:21:18.180 --> 01:21:22.540]   You know, I thought it was interesting.
[01:21:22.540 --> 01:21:27.860]   What was the story about...
[01:21:27.860 --> 01:21:28.940]   It was a French story.
[01:21:28.940 --> 01:21:30.460]   Wasn't there Chad?
[01:21:30.460 --> 01:21:34.060]   People were scandalized by something, some form of nudity.
[01:21:34.060 --> 01:21:36.380]   I don't remember this at all.
[01:21:36.380 --> 01:21:40.620]   And then I was talking about Leigh Burtet and she's bare breasted, but the French didn't...
[01:21:40.620 --> 01:21:41.620]   What was that?
[01:21:41.620 --> 01:21:42.620]   I've forgotten that.
[01:21:42.620 --> 01:21:44.620]   Is this a text story?
[01:21:44.620 --> 01:21:47.620]   I remember this at all.
[01:21:47.620 --> 01:21:48.620]   Is it a text story?
[01:21:48.620 --> 01:21:49.620]   Is it a text story?
[01:21:49.620 --> 01:21:50.620]   Yeah, well, I might have been a text story.
[01:21:50.620 --> 01:21:51.620]   I don't remember this at all.
[01:21:51.620 --> 01:21:54.300]   This is where the senility finally happened.
[01:21:54.300 --> 01:21:57.740]   I'm going to try and move old bear breasts.
[01:21:57.740 --> 01:21:58.820]   Now it wasn't bare breasted.
[01:21:58.820 --> 01:22:01.700]   It was something else that the French were scandalized by.
[01:22:01.700 --> 01:22:07.540]   And I thought this is odd given that Leigh Burtet has been naked since 1789.
[01:22:07.540 --> 01:22:08.540]   Oh, I see.
[01:22:08.540 --> 01:22:10.180]   Oh, we have no problem with bare breasts.
[01:22:10.180 --> 01:22:11.460]   Well, I thought...
[01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:13.780]   So maybe it was just a dream.
[01:22:13.780 --> 01:22:15.620]   I was a dream I had.
[01:22:15.620 --> 01:22:16.620]   [laughter]
[01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:18.020]   Are you going to...
[01:22:18.020 --> 01:22:21.580]   Speaking of Game of Thrones, right after Game of Thrones, all of Silicon Valley's...
[01:22:21.580 --> 01:22:28.340]   The new valley will be watching a show called Silicon Valley debuts tonight.
[01:22:28.340 --> 01:22:30.420]   It's kind of Game of Thrones for geeks, actually.
[01:22:30.420 --> 01:22:31.420]   Liz, have you guys...
[01:22:31.420 --> 01:22:33.500]   Oh, it was the strap on the shoulder.
[01:22:33.500 --> 01:22:34.500]   Thank you.
[01:22:34.500 --> 01:22:35.500]   Thank you.
[01:22:35.500 --> 01:22:36.500]   It was.
[01:22:36.500 --> 01:22:37.900]   It was the controversy.
[01:22:37.900 --> 01:22:39.060]   We were talking on Mac Break.
[01:22:39.060 --> 01:22:41.100]   We gave the Andy Naco.
[01:22:41.100 --> 01:22:44.460]   It was the controversy over the altered...
[01:22:44.460 --> 01:22:47.300]   Delacroix altered...
[01:22:47.300 --> 01:22:50.660]   Not Delacroix.
[01:22:50.660 --> 01:22:52.660]   See now, again, I'm really sorry.
[01:22:52.660 --> 01:22:54.460]   I'm really sorry.
[01:22:54.460 --> 01:22:56.460]   $10, right?
[01:22:56.460 --> 01:22:57.460]   It's the painting.
[01:22:57.460 --> 01:23:02.260]   Remember the painting that he was talking about in the Boston Public Library?
[01:23:02.260 --> 01:23:04.220]   Yeah.
[01:23:04.220 --> 01:23:06.540]   Back to Silicon Valley.
[01:23:06.540 --> 01:23:08.020]   Cultures are weird.
[01:23:08.020 --> 01:23:09.580]   Cultures are weird.
[01:23:09.580 --> 01:23:11.580]   Chatter them back me up.
[01:23:11.580 --> 01:23:13.820]   Anyway.
[01:23:13.820 --> 01:23:16.180]   Silicon Valley.
[01:23:16.180 --> 01:23:17.180]   Anybody...
[01:23:17.180 --> 01:23:18.180]   There was a...
[01:23:18.180 --> 01:23:20.300]   I wish I don't know why we didn't get invited to this.
[01:23:20.300 --> 01:23:23.100]   But there was in Palo Alto a screening this week.
[01:23:23.100 --> 01:23:24.860]   In Redwood City, I would say...
[01:23:24.860 --> 01:23:25.860]   Redwood City.
[01:23:25.860 --> 01:23:26.860]   Did you go?
[01:23:26.860 --> 01:23:27.860]   Get that for a report, yes.
[01:23:27.860 --> 01:23:28.860]   Yes.
[01:23:28.860 --> 01:23:29.860]   So what do you think?
[01:23:29.860 --> 01:23:30.860]   What do you think, Liz?
[01:23:30.860 --> 01:23:31.860]   I laughed.
[01:23:31.860 --> 01:23:32.860]   I am not...
[01:23:32.860 --> 01:23:36.700]   I have not a great track record for knowing what will resonate with a larger audience,
[01:23:36.700 --> 01:23:37.780]   but the...
[01:23:37.780 --> 01:23:39.620]   It was very funny.
[01:23:39.620 --> 01:23:44.460]   So the premise is it's a group of guys, all guys, who...
[01:23:44.460 --> 01:23:50.260]   One of them has an idea and they live together in a startup incubator/holic.
[01:23:50.260 --> 01:23:52.500]   Hostile kind of thing.
[01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:57.460]   And he has an idea that turns out to be technically significant.
[01:23:57.460 --> 01:24:03.780]   And in the first episode, his company wants to buy it from him or VC that's modeled on
[01:24:03.780 --> 01:24:07.020]   Peter Thiel wants him to invest in it.
[01:24:07.020 --> 01:24:10.780]   So the drama is actually the drama of running a startup.
[01:24:10.780 --> 01:24:11.780]   It's like, should we take the money?
[01:24:11.780 --> 01:24:15.620]   The second episode is all about, can we involve the guy who's not really contributing
[01:24:15.620 --> 01:24:16.620]   to the project?
[01:24:16.620 --> 01:24:17.620]   How much equity should he get?
[01:24:17.620 --> 01:24:20.180]   So does that have large mainstream appeal?
[01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:22.180]   I don't know, but it's really funnily written.
[01:24:22.180 --> 01:24:23.180]   Mike Judge did it.
[01:24:23.180 --> 01:24:27.260]   He did be his impudent, but more importantly, off his space, which is, to this day, the
[01:24:27.260 --> 01:24:30.260]   classic on life in a cube farm in a tech company.
[01:24:30.260 --> 01:24:33.300]   Yeah, and he gets it too.
[01:24:33.300 --> 01:24:35.460]   There's not like a lot of lines that fall really off.
[01:24:35.460 --> 01:24:36.460]   So that's good.
[01:24:36.460 --> 01:24:38.460]   He doesn't have a lot of...
[01:24:38.460 --> 01:24:39.460]   Yeah.
[01:24:39.460 --> 01:24:40.460]   That's good.
[01:24:40.460 --> 01:24:43.660]   There's definitely the doctor pitching you the app as he's giving you your checkup for
[01:24:43.660 --> 01:24:46.660]   your anxiety attack, which has happened to me.
[01:24:46.660 --> 01:24:50.340]   Not for an anxiety attack, but my doctors have definitely talked tech with me.
[01:24:50.340 --> 01:24:53.660]   When an app would you recommend for...
[01:24:53.660 --> 01:25:00.380]   So Nelly Bowles was there from a recode, and she wrote an article worthy of Gawker.
[01:25:00.380 --> 01:25:02.620]   I want to congratulate Nelly on this.
[01:25:02.620 --> 01:25:05.460]   No, better than Gawker, because she doesn't hate everything.
[01:25:05.460 --> 01:25:06.460]   No.
[01:25:06.460 --> 01:25:07.460]   She's awesome.
[01:25:07.460 --> 01:25:08.460]   She's like...
[01:25:08.460 --> 01:25:10.820]   She's a culture reporter who thinks culture is interesting.
[01:25:10.820 --> 01:25:13.020]   Yeah, she was great.
[01:25:13.020 --> 01:25:16.620]   She went to the movie, I guess, with you, or the TV show, I should say.
[01:25:16.620 --> 01:25:23.300]   And then afterwards, there was a little get together.
[01:25:23.300 --> 01:25:26.820]   This is where the Fox Theater in Redwood City.
[01:25:26.820 --> 01:25:29.660]   And she says Elon Musk was there.
[01:25:29.660 --> 01:25:30.660]   This is hilarious.
[01:25:30.660 --> 01:25:35.540]   He says, "The truth, it's stranger than the fiction.
[01:25:35.540 --> 01:25:38.940]   Most startups are a soap opera, but not that kind of a soap opera.
[01:25:38.940 --> 01:25:41.940]   He didn't like the show."
[01:25:41.940 --> 01:25:43.980]   He says, "Thumbs very much down.
[01:25:43.980 --> 01:25:46.500]   None of those characters were software engineers.
[01:25:46.500 --> 01:25:48.820]   Software engineers are more helpful, thoughtful, and smarter.
[01:25:48.820 --> 01:25:51.460]   They're weird, but not in the same way he insisted.
[01:25:51.460 --> 01:25:55.420]   I was just having a meeting with my information security team, and they're great, but they're
[01:25:55.420 --> 01:25:57.180]   pretty effing weird.
[01:25:57.180 --> 01:26:00.820]   One used to be a dude, one super small, one's hyper smart.
[01:26:00.820 --> 01:26:02.620]   That's actually what it is.
[01:26:02.620 --> 01:26:03.620]   This is...
[01:26:03.620 --> 01:26:06.140]   That would make for an awesome show.
[01:26:06.140 --> 01:26:08.100]   What's the idea, dude?
[01:26:08.100 --> 01:26:09.100]   What's awesome?
[01:26:09.100 --> 01:26:10.100]   It gets weirder.
[01:26:10.100 --> 01:26:12.460]   He says, "I really feel like Mike Judge has never been to Burning Man."
[01:26:12.460 --> 01:26:15.020]   Yeah, that's the best one.
[01:26:15.020 --> 01:26:16.580]   Which is Silicon Valley.
[01:26:16.580 --> 01:26:19.180]   If you haven't been, you just don't get it.
[01:26:19.180 --> 01:26:23.820]   You could take the craziest LA party and multiply it by a thousand, and it doesn't even get
[01:26:23.820 --> 01:26:25.620]   effing close to what's in Silicon Valley.
[01:26:25.620 --> 01:26:28.500]   The show didn't have any of that.
[01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:33.300]   What's funny is if you look on the Wall Street Journal, I think Elon Musk also gave them an
[01:26:33.300 --> 01:26:37.980]   interview, and I think it was maybe a few beverages earlier in the evening.
[01:26:37.980 --> 01:26:46.500]   He does sound a little schnocker here.
[01:26:46.500 --> 01:26:50.900]   The parties in Silicon Valley are amazing, because people don't care how they perceive
[01:26:50.900 --> 01:26:53.340]   socially, which I don't think Mike got.
[01:26:53.340 --> 01:26:55.460]   See, if you read it like that, it all makes more sense.
[01:26:55.460 --> 01:26:59.660]   Hollywood is a place where people always care what the public will think of them, and the
[01:26:59.660 --> 01:27:01.060]   show felt more like that.
[01:27:01.060 --> 01:27:06.580]   I've lived in Hollywood 12 years, and I've never been to an effing good party.
[01:27:06.580 --> 01:27:09.180]   He then reached for a bacon waffle, writes Nelly.
[01:27:09.180 --> 01:27:13.580]   And, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,
[01:27:13.580 --> 01:27:16.580]   and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,
[01:27:16.580 --> 01:27:18.580]   and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,
[01:27:18.580 --> 01:27:19.580]   and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,
[01:27:19.580 --> 01:27:20.580]   and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,
[01:27:20.580 --> 01:27:20.580]   and, and, and, and, and, and, and,
[01:27:20.580 --> 01:27:38.580]   and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,
[01:27:38.580 --> 01:27:45.580]   and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and, and,
