[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.800]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech.
[00:00:02.800 --> 00:00:08.240]   Peter Cohen from iMore and Backplays joins Robert Scobel, the scobelizer and Georgia
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:09.540]   Dow from iMore.
[00:00:09.540 --> 00:00:14.160]   As we talk about the week's tech news, Robert's got a crazy theory about what Apple's going
[00:00:14.160 --> 00:00:15.160]   to do in 2017.
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:18.000]   I've been dying to get them on to put them on the spot.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:19.440]   We'll do that in a whole lot more.
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:20.440]   Stay tuned.
[00:00:20.440 --> 00:00:21.440]   Twit is next.

[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.160]   The special superb owl version.
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:34.440]   We'll report here joining us three people who don't watch Super Bowl.
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:39.440]   Robert Scobull is in his tie-dye celebrating and I bet you want to watch Super Bowl after
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:40.440]   this is over.
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:42.200]   Oh look at that he's got a HoloLens there.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.200]   Yeah.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.200]   Nice.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:48.640]   I won't use it on air but we certainly are good and probably talk about it today right?
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:49.640]   That's nice.
[00:02:49.640 --> 00:02:52.560]   I don't know what using it on air would even mean from our point of view.
[00:02:52.560 --> 00:02:54.760]   We'd look like Jordy.
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.520]   Why wouldn't we talk about it?
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:57.520]   Yeah.
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:02:59.560]   Well off somewhere else.
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.880]   We actually did on Windows Weekly.
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:02.360]   We did a demo of it.
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:06.960]   We were able to connect the output of the HoloLens to Skype.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:08.800]   So we, Mary Jo Foley was wearing it.
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:10.840]   We could see her and then we could see what she was seeing.
[00:03:10.840 --> 00:03:12.200]   It was actually kind of cool.
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:13.200]   It was pretty neat.
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.960]   I'm a fan but we'll talk about that in a bit because you have some interesting theories
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:19.960]   about augmented reality in its future.
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:20.960]   Yeah.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:21.960]   We now read it.
[00:03:21.960 --> 00:03:22.960]   I'd rather look on it.
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:23.960]   Yes.
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:24.960]   We now, as scoblaging.com.
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:26.760]   I haven't seen the new book yet.
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:28.160]   I would like to.
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:30.680]   Also with us Georgia Dow from iMore.com.
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:31.680]   Hi Georgia.
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:32.680]   Hey.
[00:03:32.680 --> 00:03:35.480]   Fresh off the slope she's skied this morning.
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:37.320]   She'll be skiing this evening.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:38.320]   I will.
[00:03:38.320 --> 00:03:39.320]   She's a ski fanatic.
[00:03:39.320 --> 00:03:43.520]   I'm thank you for taking time out of your ski day to join us today.
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:45.360]   We appreciate it.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:50.280]   And also with us, your former colleague from iMore, Peter Cohen, is here.
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.280]   Hello.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.600]   Actually, I guess not former.
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.600]   You're still at iMore.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:55.080]   No, I'm not.
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:58.080]   Well, I freelance but I'm at Backblaze these days.
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:03:59.080]   That's what I thought.
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.800]   Yeah, I know you've been doing a lot of stuff at Backblaze.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.480]   It's great to see you once again.
[00:04:02.480 --> 00:04:07.640]   Peter, of course, has been around forever covering gaming among other things but you cover
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:08.880]   everything these days.
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:09.880]   Yeah, indeed.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:10.880]   Yeah.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:12.720]   With an emphasis on the Apple ecosystem as always.
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:13.720]   Oh good.
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.720]   Well, you're all Appleites.
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:24.240]   Let's start off with Robert's thesis that there's going to be a massive announcement from Apple.
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:28.040]   We just got the Apple quarterly results this week.
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:30.800]   They sold 78 million iPhones, right?
[00:04:30.800 --> 00:04:32.120]   A ton of iPhones.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:35.360]   iPhones still easily driving the company.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:41.240]   They made $17.8 billion in three months and they beat the street and they were back to
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:44.160]   revenue growth, which they'd been off for a little bit.
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.960]   In fact, the actual revenues and all-time record, according to Apple.
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:55.720]   But the number two division at Apple is the online services, not Mac, not iPad.
[00:04:55.720 --> 00:04:56.720]   It's online.
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:05:02.440]   In fact, iPad declined down 19% year over year and revenue down 22%.
[00:05:02.440 --> 00:05:04.160]   But services was huge.
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:10.200]   They made the revenue of $24 billion on iCloud, Apple Pay, Apple Music.
[00:05:10.200 --> 00:05:18.200]   So I think it's safe to say at this point, Apple is the iPhone and iCloud company, right?
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:22.160]   But as with any company Silicon Valley, you've got to find the next big thing.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.560]   And I don't think it's the watch.
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:24.560]   Sorry to say.
[00:05:24.560 --> 00:05:26.520]   I don't think it's the iPad.
[00:05:26.520 --> 00:05:28.360]   There's a new watch coming this year.
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:29.360]   Really?
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:30.360]   A series three?
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:31.360]   Yeah.
[00:05:31.360 --> 00:05:32.880]   A new iPad coming this year.
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:33.880]   That we expect.
[00:05:33.880 --> 00:05:35.200]   A new TV coming this year.
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:36.920]   Really they're going to do a TV?
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:37.920]   A new...
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.400]   Everything is coming new this year.
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:45.000]   They're launching more new products this year than they have announced in a long time.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.400]   Before we go on, you don't mean a television set.
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:48.400]   You mean a new Apple?
[00:05:48.400 --> 00:05:49.400]   No, I'm talking about the little box.
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:50.400]   Yeah.
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:51.400]   Which is doing the Apple TV is...
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:57.400]   I keep hearing rumors about a television set too, but I hear that the TV box will have
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.120]   a new 3D sensor from PrimeSense.
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:04.520]   And Apple has 600 engineers working on just the sensor on these new products.
[00:06:04.520 --> 00:06:06.520]   So let's talk about what's...
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:07.520]   Go ahead Peter.
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:12.360]   I hear the rumors about the Apple television as well, but usually when Gene Munster has
[00:06:12.360 --> 00:06:14.680]   returned from like a 3-day peyote binge.
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.320]   It's always Gene Munster.
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:17.320]   Always with the...
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:21.840]   He was the guy who played his career on the line with the Apple TV and finally admitted.
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:22.840]   Yeah.
[00:06:22.840 --> 00:06:23.840]   No, I don't...
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:25.520]   They're not going to do it, but I don't think that it wasn't that they were thinking about
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:26.520]   it.
[00:06:26.520 --> 00:06:27.520]   And this is one of the things that's difficult.
[00:06:27.520 --> 00:06:29.520]   A, Apple is very secretive.
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:30.520]   They don't announce anything.
[00:06:30.520 --> 00:06:31.520]   And B, they try everything.
[00:06:31.520 --> 00:06:34.080]   They've got hundreds of billions of dollars in cash.
[00:06:34.080 --> 00:06:39.040]   They can have a TV division that never produces a product because they're investigating it.
[00:06:39.040 --> 00:06:40.040]   Even Tim Cook has said that.
[00:06:40.040 --> 00:06:41.520]   We investigate a lot of things.
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:46.120]   So anything you say Robert at this point could be something in prototype but not necessarily
[00:06:46.120 --> 00:06:47.120]   a product.
[00:06:47.120 --> 00:06:48.880]   But you're convinced there is going to be a product.
[00:06:48.880 --> 00:06:51.680]   I have many, many sources who say I'm right.
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.080]   Plus I was on CNBC telling you the same...
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:06:59.360]   That audience, the same thing I'm telling you here and nobody from Apple PR called it.
[00:06:59.360 --> 00:07:05.040]   And you know how Apple PR is if you get something incorrect about their company, particularly
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:07.440]   in a venue of that note.
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:11.160]   So you think that there will be a big announcement because it's the 10th anniversary iPhone.
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:17.240]   They're opening the spaceship campus that there will be something like how big?
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:18.240]   Big.
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.760]   Like huge for Apple.
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:22.760]   This is Tim Cook's legacy.
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:24.480]   It goes all the way back.
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:28.560]   In fact, it's Steve Jobs' legacy too because it goes all the way back to Steve Jobs when
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:31.680]   they had a conversation about the future of television.
[00:07:31.680 --> 00:07:35.840]   And right after that they started patenting things about augmented reality.
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:41.560]   A phone that had a 3D sensor on it that looked clear where you held it up and you could see
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:45.560]   virtual things sort of like with this hollow lens, right?
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:47.480]   And it's not just Apple.
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:49.920]   If it was just Apple I'd be like, okay.
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:54.800]   But you know, when I went to the Consumer Electronics Show I saw many things in the
[00:07:54.800 --> 00:07:58.360]   back rooms like this pair of Lumis lenses.
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.560]   Now look at just the lenses here.
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:06.960]   These have 720p monitors in the lenses and a little computer.
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:11.640]   Now notice it's sitting next to a Snapchat glasses which doesn't even have a screen.
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:15.960]   And that's from a company that got 60 million of investment.
[00:08:15.960 --> 00:08:19.760]   Apple forced Carl Zeiss to pull their optics off the show floor.
[00:08:19.760 --> 00:08:22.440]   I have to ask you about that because we've been going back and forth.
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:27.440]   I saw your Facebook post saying Zeiss was in the AR booth with no AR to show in the AR
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:29.480]   pavilion with no AR to show.
[00:08:29.480 --> 00:08:33.680]   And you said that you were told that Zeiss was working on something with Apple.
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:37.680]   But it wasn't clear if you were told that or you deduced it from the fact that when you
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:40.440]   mentioned that the Zeiss people looked away.
[00:08:40.440 --> 00:08:42.840]   Did somebody actually say it verbally say it?
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:43.840]   Yes.
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:44.840]   Okay.
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:45.840]   Yes.
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:46.840]   That's what I suspected.
[00:08:46.840 --> 00:08:47.840]   But everybody said no, no.
[00:08:47.840 --> 00:08:48.840]   He's talking about this nuance thing here.
[00:08:48.840 --> 00:08:49.840]   No.
[00:08:49.840 --> 00:08:50.840]   No, somebody told me that.
[00:08:50.840 --> 00:08:51.840]   Well, you know what?
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:52.840]   That's how humans work too.
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:57.640]   It's nuance and everybody starts laughing when you talk about something that confirms
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.800]   your nervous laughter.
[00:08:59.800 --> 00:09:06.320]   Who, which other company has the ability to force a multi-billion dollar company, which
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:09.880]   Carl Zeiss is, to pull something off the show floor.
[00:09:09.880 --> 00:09:13.680]   And they showed optics the year before at Consumer Electron show.
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:17.680]   And they were right in the middle of the augmented reality booth without any augmented
[00:09:17.680 --> 00:09:19.280]   reality stuff in their booth.
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.240]   And everybody knows that is a fact.
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:22.240]   That seems weird.
[00:09:22.240 --> 00:09:23.240]   Yeah.
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:25.200]   Hey, so what do you think?
[00:09:25.200 --> 00:09:30.120]   So you've got this from one source, two sources, many sources.
[00:09:30.120 --> 00:09:33.280]   I've been flying the world and I've been meeting with people at the highest level.
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:40.240]   I'm interviewing the chief economist for CTA at South by Southwest, you know, on and
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:41.560]   on.
[00:09:41.560 --> 00:09:44.320]   This has been coming for a long time.
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:50.320]   I did the first interview for my book in 2011 with the chief technicolor officer of
[00:09:50.320 --> 00:09:52.960]   Matayo, which Apple bought.
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:57.120]   If you go and listen to my interviews with the founder of PrimeSense, he tells you what
[00:09:57.120 --> 00:09:58.920]   he's going to do.
[00:09:58.920 --> 00:10:01.760]   And then he got bought by Apple, right?
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:03.960]   And on and on and on.
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:09.440]   Tim Cook has bought a dozen or so companies, most of which we haven't heard of or haven't
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:12.400]   understood why they are important.
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:15.840]   Companies like Turi that are doing artificial intelligence.
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:20.920]   He, the founder of Turi, he noted the data science conference in June and then two weeks
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:22.920]   later he gets bought by Apple.
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:26.720]   So Apple is up to something big.
[00:10:26.720 --> 00:10:30.800]   You can't deny that anymore based on the patents that have been reported based on the
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:35.160]   rumors of glass iPhones coming and stuff like that.
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:39.000]   So whether you listen to me or not, what is it going to be?
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   What is it?
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   What's the product?
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.440]   Tim, I've been telling you, it's augmented reality.
[00:10:43.440 --> 00:10:47.760]   It's next generation augmented reality or what we call mixed reality in this industry.
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.240]   And it's not just Apple, right?
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.840]   Microsoft has 1,800 people working on it.
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:52.840]   It's clear.
[00:10:52.840 --> 00:10:53.840]   They've got the HoloLens.
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:54.840]   Yeah.
[00:10:54.840 --> 00:10:56.480]   I mean, look, I think augmented reality is going to be big.
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:57.480]   I don't deny it.
[00:10:57.480 --> 00:11:01.760]   In fact, I think it's bigger than VR personally, but you potentially.
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:06.760]   But it's a big, there's a jump from that to say everybody's going to be doing it.
[00:11:06.760 --> 00:11:07.760]   Everybody's working on it.
[00:11:07.760 --> 00:11:09.840]   Say Apple's got a product.
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:10.840]   You're saying this.
[00:11:10.840 --> 00:11:12.520]   You think this year Apple will have a product?
[00:11:12.520 --> 00:11:13.520]   What will it be like?
[00:11:13.520 --> 00:11:14.520]   Will it be like HoloLens?
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:15.520]   What will it be?
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:21.640]   Apple has a range of products coming out, including a new iPad, three new iPhones, a new
[00:11:21.640 --> 00:11:25.000]   TV product, a new watch.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.520]   They've already had the earphones.
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:29.640]   By the way, the earphones have a motion sensors in them, right?
[00:11:29.640 --> 00:11:33.680]   Which let you do fun things if you pull the earphone out at your thing.
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.800]   Your music stops playing, right?
[00:11:35.800 --> 00:11:39.840]   But it also has motion sensors for your head.
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:44.760]   Why? because they're going to announce a very lightweight pair of glasses and they're going
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:50.160]   to move all the electronics they can out of those glasses and into other places on your
[00:11:50.160 --> 00:11:54.360]   body, i.e. a phone in your pocket, your headphones in your ears.
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:57.200]   So your Cohen, is this match when you be hearing?
[00:11:57.200 --> 00:12:00.160]   Does this sound reasonable to you?
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.000]   Yeah, it all goes.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.320]   Although my eye posit that VR is dead in the water until it stops looking like a toaster
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:10.600]   is trying to have sex with your forehead.
[00:12:10.600 --> 00:12:12.600]   And I'd agree with you on that.
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:17.360]   I just showed you the Loomis optics.
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:21.680]   That's proof that they're coming and coming from a number of manufacturers.
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:23.680]   Are those AR or VR?
[00:12:23.680 --> 00:12:24.680]   Those are AR.
[00:12:24.680 --> 00:12:25.680]   These are AR.
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:29.080]   And by the way, when you say do they do AR or VR?
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:32.600]   Whenever you see new optics from now on, they're going to do both.
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:33.600]   Yeah.
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:38.160]   But something like those, those wouldn't be great virtual reality because they're glasses.
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:39.760]   You can see outside them.
[00:12:39.760 --> 00:12:43.320]   So they're not immersive virtual realities we're used to.
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:44.880]   We'll see.
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:49.840]   The optics from what I'm hearing are going to turn opaque or black.
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:54.400]   And you can have some things that make your eyes totally black if you want to get full
[00:12:54.400 --> 00:12:55.920]   on into VR land.
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:12:57.480]   Yeah, but you can still see it on the sides.
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:12:58.720]   I mean, I think VR has to be in the most.
[00:12:58.720 --> 00:13:00.800]   None of you can have ways to cover that up.
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.720]   Put a bag over your head.
[00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:03.720]   Yeah.
[00:13:03.720 --> 00:13:06.000]   I mean, does that bother me with glasses?
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   No.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   Glasses turned black.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   You know?
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   I guess it's what the VR is for.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.160]   To me, VR is a gaming cloud.
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:13.600]   You're all into VR, Georgia.
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:14.600]   Dow, you have a--
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:15.600]   I love VR.
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.640]   You have set up a room just for your vibe.
[00:13:17.640 --> 00:13:19.880]   We're going to be buying a house just for VR.
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:20.880]   Wait a minute.
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:21.880]   No, really?
[00:13:21.880 --> 00:13:22.880]   Really?
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:23.880]   Kind of.
[00:13:23.880 --> 00:13:24.880]   Yeah.
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:25.880]   No, that's not even.
[00:13:25.880 --> 00:13:26.880]   That's not a lot.
[00:13:26.880 --> 00:13:27.880]   Is it have a holodeck?
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.280]   We're buying-- well, hopefully at one point, yes.
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:32.800]   No, we're buying a house, but we're going to make sure that we have enough space to be
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:33.800]   able to have a really nice VR room.
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:34.800]   Dedicated VR room.
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.760]   Because if you're going to buy a house, you want it all, right?
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:39.360]   It's like our gaming den.
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:40.680]   It just has to have.
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:41.680]   Doesn't everyone have that?
[00:13:41.680 --> 00:13:42.680]   Yeah.
[00:13:42.680 --> 00:13:43.680]   Yeah.
[00:13:43.680 --> 00:13:47.800]   So I think that all of us agree that AR is something that Apple is deeply looking into.
[00:13:47.800 --> 00:13:51.320]   I think that where I might disagree through it is the timeline.
[00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:54.680]   Like I don't think that this is going to be coming out this year.
[00:13:54.680 --> 00:13:57.640]   I don't think it's going to be coming out next year either because Apple does not do
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:13:59.680]   well when they're the first ones out of the gate.
[00:13:59.680 --> 00:14:00.680]   They're not the first ones.
[00:14:00.680 --> 00:14:02.520]   HoloLens is already out.
[00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:06.240]   HoloLens is not really a viable product.
[00:14:06.240 --> 00:14:09.680]   And they don't do well until everyone else has kind of gone out, seen what they've done.
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:12.920]   And then Apple goes out and takes a look at all the data and does it better.
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:15.720]   And that's when Apple is exceptionally successful.
[00:14:15.720 --> 00:14:21.680]   You're forgetting about something that this is not the first time Apple is coming to the
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:24.880]   rodeo and Microsoft is already out.
[00:14:24.880 --> 00:14:26.640]   They're not the first one.
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:30.200]   And they're not the first one in any stretch of the imagination.
[00:14:30.200 --> 00:14:34.280]   There's dozens of companies that are making augmented reality stuff.
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:39.440]   It just hasn't gotten to consumers because it has not gotten to the small enough sizes.
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:43.400]   But whether Apple does or not, small sized glass, they're coming this year.
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:44.760]   They are not coming next year.
[00:14:44.760 --> 00:14:46.560]   They're coming this year.
[00:14:46.560 --> 00:14:47.560]   I would love that.
[00:14:47.560 --> 00:14:48.760]   I'm totally not against it.
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:53.320]   It just seems like without the actual data of people using the product, Apple is going
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:57.600]   to say, listen, we're going to wait around and see what people like, what they don't
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:59.840]   like so that they can fix it, change it, make it better.
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:00.840]   They have all this money.
[00:15:00.840 --> 00:15:03.480]   There's no reason that they have to be the first ones out of the gate.
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:06.240]   It doesn't benefit them in any way, shape, or form.
[00:15:06.240 --> 00:15:07.240]   Being first.
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:08.480]   You're wrong about that.
[00:15:08.480 --> 00:15:10.280]   It sets Apple.
[00:15:10.280 --> 00:15:14.800]   And by the way, I've been talking to executives at competitors and the competitors believe
[00:15:14.800 --> 00:15:16.520]   I'm right about this.
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:21.600]   And the competitors believe from China, believe Apple is two years ahead of the rest of the
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:24.360]   industry with these announcements that are coming.
[00:15:24.360 --> 00:15:27.320]   This is very important for Apple to nail.
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:32.680]   Because if they miss a user interface switch, and this is what we're in, that's why I called
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:37.200]   my book, and we called our book, fourth transformation because it's the fourth user interface switch
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:39.120]   of our lifetimes.
[00:15:39.120 --> 00:15:43.880]   You know when we went from DOS to Windows, Borland and WordPerfect went away and they were
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:46.400]   dramatically important companies of the day.
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:51.080]   And when we went to touch computing on our phones, Nokia and BlackBerry went away for
[00:15:51.080 --> 00:15:53.120]   all intents and purposes, right?
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:56.360]   Because they did not dead on the new user interface.
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:59.440]   And Microsoft knows this because they missed last time.
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:05.760]   They have to win in this space where they're going to lose a lot of their business to others.
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:09.400]   And Apple knows that this as well.
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:14.240]   They're the ones that are expected to show up once in a while and really wow us with something
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:15.240]   new.
[00:16:15.240 --> 00:16:18.800]   And that is coming this year, not next year.
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:25.680]   Next year is too late because Magic, Microsoft, Facebook, Google are all going to uncloke
[00:16:25.680 --> 00:16:30.240]   mixed reality glasses in the next 18 months.
[00:16:30.240 --> 00:16:33.880]   Yeah I mean I absolutely think Apple's working on AR.
[00:16:33.880 --> 00:16:34.880]   I think there's no question.
[00:16:34.880 --> 00:16:36.680]   Tim Coosie even said it in effect.
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:38.440]   Many times every week.
[00:16:38.440 --> 00:16:39.440]   Every week.
[00:16:39.440 --> 00:16:40.440]   For 17 minutes now.
[00:16:40.440 --> 00:16:41.440]   I don't know.
[00:16:41.440 --> 00:16:45.640]   And I've certainly Apple has in the past, and it's getting to be the distant past by
[00:16:45.640 --> 00:16:46.640]   the way.
[00:16:46.640 --> 00:16:51.640]   Made some transformative inventions that they, you know, really the iPhone is the best example.
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:58.200]   iPod, I guess you could argue about the iPad which sales have been dropping dramatically.
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:01.920]   And I think you could also argue about the Apple watch which is not in my opinion been
[00:17:01.920 --> 00:17:02.920]   successful.
[00:17:02.920 --> 00:17:06.720]   I wonder if Apple has what it takes to transform.
[00:17:06.720 --> 00:17:07.960]   I think I agree with you.
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:10.000]   I think there's two interfaces that are coming.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:11.280]   Augmented reality is one.
[00:17:11.280 --> 00:17:14.920]   I think voice interface is also a very important shift.
[00:17:14.920 --> 00:17:15.920]   Yes.
[00:17:15.920 --> 00:17:16.920]   And Apple sucks at that.
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:17.920]   There's a three-thing to.
[00:17:17.920 --> 00:17:18.920]   Yeah, series terrible.
[00:17:18.920 --> 00:17:19.920]   It's well.
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:20.920]   It's laggard.
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:29.360]   It's the fourth worst choice out there after Amazon and Google and Cortana then Siri.
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:33.680]   So Apple, I don't know if Apple has, I don't know if Apple killed Siri.
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:36.200]   Apple took a good product and made it terrible.
[00:17:36.200 --> 00:17:37.800]   Time out, time out, time out.
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:42.660]   I had dinner with Tom who still works at Apple and is one of the three guys who started
[00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:43.660]   Siri.
[00:17:43.660 --> 00:17:46.320]   Remember, Siri was launched on that couch right there.
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:48.280]   I have Adam Chai, Adam Chai.
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:49.280]   Adam.
[00:17:49.280 --> 00:17:52.760]   And then Adam went out and started Viv and they sold it to Samsung.
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:54.520]   And that's the second part of my story.
[00:17:54.520 --> 00:17:56.160]   Let's go one at a time.
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:18:02.720]   I had dinner with Tom three years ago and I asked him and this was at a venture capital
[00:18:02.720 --> 00:18:05.680]   party.
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:10.520]   The venture capitalist was Gary Morgan Thaler of Morgan Thaler Ventures which now is called
[00:18:10.520 --> 00:18:11.520]   Canvas.vc.
[00:18:11.520 --> 00:18:15.440]   I was sitting in his backyard because they keep inviting me to this party.
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:16.440]   Why?
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:22.480]   Gary Morgan Thaler says only two people understood Siri, me and Steve Jobs.
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:28.680]   So it all wraps up together because when Tom and I had dinner three years ago, I asked
[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:31.560]   him what are you learning about running Siri?
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:34.240]   And he says I've learned that Google is beating us.
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:35.640]   And I said, how do you know that?
[00:18:35.640 --> 00:18:40.840]   He says, well, we instrumented Google and we know that their AI is learning faster than
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:41.840]   our-
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:44.280]   You know that by using it, any idiot knows that.
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:45.280]   That's obvious.
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:47.280]   This was three years ago before it was-
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:50.480]   I asked Siri this morning, what time is kickoff in the Super Bowl?
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:54.520]   And his response was, that's a very interesting question.
[00:18:54.520 --> 00:18:55.520]   Siri's a moron.
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:57.680]   I swear it's Siri more than I do at any human.
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:19:02.840]   He's not letting me talk because you're talking nonstop and you're spouting nonsense, Robert.
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:05.680]   But he said something very important.
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:09.000]   He said, we are going to have to rebuild Siri from scratch.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:11.760]   That was three years ago and they're going to launch it next year.
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:16.520]   Now the second part of the story is Viv, because his two friends left Apple and started this
[00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:18.080]   company named Viv.
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:23.160]   And when I saw it a year ago, year and two months ago, I asked Adam Chire, are you going
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:27.240]   to sell this back to Apple because it's way better than what Apple has?
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.760]   It's way better than Siri.
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:33.600]   And he says, he told me, no, I'm not going to sell to a big company because I think this
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:37.720]   is important to make a company around and go independent.
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:40.600]   And then nine months later, he sells to Samsung.
[00:19:40.600 --> 00:19:41.600]   Why?
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:44.960]   Because it wasn't anything except that Apple has lost its mojo.
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:47.920]   I don't see Apple as the horses to do this.
[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:50.480]   Apple's produced crap for the last three years.
[00:19:50.480 --> 00:19:53.440]   There's no way they're going to jump on this AR thing and turn it around.
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:57.560]   I doubt Microsoft will, although Microsoft's way ahead of the game.
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:19:59.840]   They bought the best companies on the field.
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:01.840]   You tell me they're going to do anything?
[00:20:01.840 --> 00:20:02.840]   They bought Siri.
[00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:04.200]   How did that work out?
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:05.920]   They bought Tori.
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:10.080]   Siri was the most profitable acquisition of all time.
[00:20:10.080 --> 00:20:11.080]   It's a piece of crap.
[00:20:11.080 --> 00:20:14.440]   It's not even a crap money for Apple than any other.
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:15.440]   Siri did?
[00:20:15.440 --> 00:20:17.840]   How did Siri make any money for Apple?
[00:20:17.840 --> 00:20:22.640]   Because when they first shipped on the iPhone, I think, for the 4S, that was the only feature
[00:20:22.640 --> 00:20:24.760]   that mattered.
[00:20:24.760 --> 00:20:27.440]   And they sold billions of dollars the first day.
[00:20:27.440 --> 00:20:31.200]   I won't dispute that they tricked people, but I don't think they produced a product of
[00:20:31.200 --> 00:20:32.200]   any value.
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:38.760]   I just agree with you, Siri is a dramatically important product just because it sucks now
[00:20:38.760 --> 00:20:41.920]   and you're going to see that the new one doesn't suck.
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:47.840]   And what's worse is when you go to the glasses, you only have room for one voice interfaith.
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:48.840]   And that's going to...
[00:20:48.840 --> 00:20:49.840]   No, I agree.
[00:20:49.840 --> 00:20:50.840]   I agree.
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:55.640]   I think that this, the AR and voice will be, can be a magical transformation.
[00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:57.600]   And I'm not saying it's impossible for Apple to do this.
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:00.560]   I just say there hasn't been a lot of evidence in the last couple of years.
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:04.120]   You can make all the acquisitions you want that they know how to do this.
[00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:08.320]   For the last five years, you have to look at what he's been doing under the covers.
[00:21:08.320 --> 00:21:10.080]   He's been working on this for seven years.
[00:21:10.080 --> 00:21:13.080]   He spent more than $10 billion.
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:15.760]   Everybody knows you can look at the patents.
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:21.680]   No, I think that though they are definitely working on it, I think that the use case for
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.200]   AR is still weak.
[00:21:23.200 --> 00:21:26.880]   People don't really know how they would use it, what would be the best cases to use it,
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:28.080]   when would they use it.
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:31.520]   And I love virtual reality and I love AR as well.
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:35.520]   So I think that it's the future, but the fact of Apple jumping in at the head of the
[00:21:35.520 --> 00:21:37.320]   game at this time.
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:40.320]   Again, just seems like way too soon for Apple.
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:44.200]   Once it becomes more mainstream, once people understand it, trust it, feel comfortable
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:48.360]   with it, that would make the most sense for Apple to end up investing and actually launching
[00:21:48.360 --> 00:21:49.360]   a product.
[00:21:49.360 --> 00:21:52.800]   Because whenever Apple even coughs or has a cold, something goes wrong.
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:55.120]   They lose a lot of money in stock.
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:56.920]   >> Well, they're doing fine.
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:58.800]   Nobody's denying Apple's making money.
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:21:59.800]   I'm not denying that.
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:04.120]   >> You're assuming that Apple is the same tomorrow as it was yesterday.
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:05.120]   That's a bad.
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:07.120]   >> No, I think that's what you're doing.
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:10.560]   The best way of assuming behavior though.
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:17.000]   It is the best way to tell behavior of any unitary source item person is from what they
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   did before.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:20.360]   Apple's a very pattern oriented company.
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:23.560]   When they jump out of their patterns, they don't actually do that well.
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:25.600]   So I think that they'll do something that'll be amazing.
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:28.080]   I just think that our timelines are different.
[00:22:28.080 --> 00:22:31.360]   >> They know that, well, you can argue all you want.
[00:22:31.360 --> 00:22:35.480]   I know what's coming and I have many, many sources saying I'm right.
[00:22:35.480 --> 00:22:39.800]   So if you're betting against Apple, doing it this year, you're going to lose.
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:40.800]   >> I hope you're right.
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:42.920]   I would love to see a transformative technology.
[00:22:42.920 --> 00:22:43.920]   >> No.
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:44.920]   Absolutely.
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:47.000]   >> The question is when do I get the glasses?
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.640]   They might show them off in June and then they might say they're not going to ship until
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:52.120]   the first quarter of next year.
[00:22:52.120 --> 00:22:55.520]   And that would make the timing a suspect.
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:58.600]   But I'm willing to even concede that point.
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:01.560]   But you're going to see it in June or September at the latest.
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:04.080]   >> Peter, do you think I'm just a burnout?
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:09.040]   >> I've put my trust in love and Apple for too long and been disappointed for too long.
[00:23:09.040 --> 00:23:12.760]   And now I just can't accept that Apple could possibly transform the world.
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:14.280]   Is that my problem?
[00:23:14.280 --> 00:23:20.120]   >> I think listening to you and Scoble is like listening to Oscar and feel it to me.
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:24.560]   >> What does that view stand for?
[00:23:24.560 --> 00:23:27.760]   Wait a minute, which one's Oscar, which one's Felix?
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:30.760]   >> You two globiating blow hearts.
[00:23:30.760 --> 00:23:34.000]   Shut the hell up.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.840]   >> Well, what do you think, Peter?
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:37.840]   >> You know what?
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:43.240]   I'm going to be interested when Luxotic gets into the wearable business.
[00:23:43.240 --> 00:23:44.720]   Wake me up when that happens.
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:48.640]   >> All the Sturm and Dron means absolutely nothing.
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:54.200]   >> We do spend a lot of energy kind of crystal balling Apple.
[00:23:54.200 --> 00:23:57.960]   And you know, I mean, nobody knows what they're really going to do except Scoble who's got
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:59.160]   the insight.
[00:23:59.160 --> 00:24:08.200]   >> By the way, I have no idea how advanced these things are going to be.
[00:24:08.200 --> 00:24:13.600]   A company from Israel called Yowz that came and visited me a month ago and showed me some
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:20.800]   mind blowing artificial intelligence that takes the 3D image of your scene and segments
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:26.960]   every object on your table into a separate object and then starts doing AI lookups.
[00:24:26.960 --> 00:24:29.320]   It was absolutely mind blowing.
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:35.120]   And that was done with 16 engineers in Tel Aviv and Apple has 600 working on just the 3D
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.120]   sensor.
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:38.960]   So that's pretty crazy.
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.280]   >> What is the 3D sensor?
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:41.280]   Is it magic?
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:42.280]   Is it magic leap?
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:43.280]   What is it?
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:46.040]   I don't understand what a 3D sensor would do.
[00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:51.680]   There's a little company called PrimeSense that four years ago showed me a 3D sensor.
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:53.000]   They licensed that.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   >> Oh yeah, that's connect.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:56.520]   >> You can swap for connect, right?
[00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:57.520]   >> And Apple bottom.
[00:24:57.520 --> 00:24:58.760]   >> Which became HoloLens.
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:24:59.760]   >> Yeah.
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:05.680]   >> So HoloLens owes some of its birth right down to PrimeSense.
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:11.400]   And the guy who started PrimeSense showed me four years ago a sensor that was aiming
[00:25:11.400 --> 00:25:16.160]   at tables about three feet away and it could tell how hard you were touching the table.
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:18.080]   >> This is from 2014.
[00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:21.600]   Apple's secret plans for PrimeSense 3D.
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.640]   This is two and a half years old.
[00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:27.120]   Did you think this is going to happen sometime in this year?
[00:25:27.120 --> 00:25:32.520]   This would be the time from a corporate point of view because it's a big anniversary and
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:34.160]   all that stuff.
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:38.280]   I wonder if Apple's got what it's going to take.
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:39.760]   But you know what?
[00:25:39.760 --> 00:25:40.760]   We don't know.
[00:25:40.760 --> 00:25:41.760]   We'll find out.
[00:25:41.760 --> 00:25:42.760]   We should make a bet.
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:44.320]   We should bet some big thing.
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:46.280]   >> I've already bet my entire career.
[00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:47.920]   >> Okay, that's good enough.
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:52.160]   >> You'll be fine even if it comes out in two years.
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:54.960]   You'll be fine.
[00:25:54.960 --> 00:25:56.200]   >> It won't be two years.
[00:25:56.200 --> 00:25:57.200]   It's this year.
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:58.200]   It's this year.
[00:25:58.200 --> 00:25:59.520]   >> I hope you're right.
[00:25:59.520 --> 00:26:00.520]   I'm thrilled by this.
[00:26:00.520 --> 00:26:04.200]   It sounds a little science fiction-y to me, to be honest.
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:09.040]   >> Well, that's what Robert's talking about here.
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:14.880]   So I'm going to take on face value that all the product announcements are coming and that
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:16.040]   they're all going to be glorious.
[00:26:16.040 --> 00:26:20.240]   But the question is, what is really going to hit with consumers?
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:22.840]   >> Yeah, we don't even talk about that.
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:27.560]   >> Yeah, that is an area that Apple has not at all been consistent with for the past
[00:26:27.560 --> 00:26:28.560]   few years.
[00:26:28.560 --> 00:26:32.400]   So I'm going to be very interested to see how that affects things.
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:35.200]   >> Now, who has VR on the show?
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:40.080]   Because if you have VR, you realize that something is going on outside of Apple.
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:41.720]   >> Actually, I went the other way.
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:46.560]   So Georgia's obviously, if she raised her hand, I have Oculus Rift and I have a Vive
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:47.560]   at home.
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:50.040]   I have a lot of places I got bored with it and stopped using.
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:53.320]   I've used them all and I just didn't even buy the PlayStation VR.
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:54.320]   I was excited.
[00:26:54.320 --> 00:26:55.320]   >> Do you run, Jelica?
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:27:00.440]   >> No, everybody, every time I mention that I'm bored with Vive, somebody says, "Well,
[00:27:00.440 --> 00:27:02.240]   have you seen, have you seen?"
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:05.720]   And every time I try it, it goes, "Yeah, that was fun for five minutes."
[00:27:05.720 --> 00:27:09.400]   What is it about at Georgia that continues to compel you?
[00:27:09.400 --> 00:27:12.560]   >> Well, I love the, this is one of the few cases.
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:14.560]   So I do martial arts and I love doing martial arts.
[00:27:14.560 --> 00:27:18.240]   And this is great, I can actually use my martial arts skills and interact with the world.
[00:27:18.240 --> 00:27:23.680]   I think that the difference in why a lot of people find VR a little bit more exhausting
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:24.680]   is because it is.
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:25.680]   You're actually moving around.
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:29.840]   This is not like the old gaming where you're doing this to decompress and be relaxed.
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:32.320]   This is going to make you a little bit more anxious.
[00:27:32.320 --> 00:27:33.640]   It's going to burn off some energy.
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:35.640]   It's going to make you feel exhausted after that.
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:39.800]   And there's definitely a certain amount of mental and visual fatigue that you're going
[00:27:39.800 --> 00:27:44.040]   through because your brain is processing at a much faster rate during while you're playing
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:45.320]   these games.
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:50.080]   And so for a lot of cases, I think it's just because it's a little bit more tiresome.
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:51.600]   There's a big setup that comes to it.
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:53.400]   You have to make sure that everything's on.
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:55.520]   You have to clear your playing space.
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:58.720]   And so it's not like the usual games where you can sit there and relax.
[00:27:58.720 --> 00:28:01.040]   This is the opposite experience to that.
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:02.480]   And that's what I enjoy about it.
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:05.880]   But it's not something that I could play for five hours during the day.
[00:28:05.880 --> 00:28:10.640]   I think that as we go and it becomes much more mobile and it's easier to set up and the
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:15.840]   headsets are not like toasters that are doing things to your face, as Peter mentioned.
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:18.880]   I think that then it's going to be a much easier to use.
[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:23.400]   And there's going to be a greater set of people that are going to want to jump in.
[00:28:23.400 --> 00:28:25.240]   But its use cases are huge.
[00:28:25.240 --> 00:28:29.240]   I just don't think that the public, the general public has embraced that yet.
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:31.520]   And I think that they're testing out different things.
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:36.200]   But yeah, like the ability of Superhot to actually look all the way through an environment
[00:28:36.200 --> 00:28:42.440]   and your movement determines the speed of which the bad guys are coming towards you.
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:45.960]   It's a really neat experiential gaming thing.
[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:49.960]   But if you don't like experiential gaming, then VR is not really for you.
[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:52.720]   Well, I feel like that's a niche.
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:53.720]   I don't know.
[00:28:53.720 --> 00:28:58.200]   That sounds like the same things people said about Nintendo Wii or 3D TV, both of which
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:01.400]   were kind of, I think we have to acknowledge failures in the long run.
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:04.400]   Yeah, but you know, Leo, you have to take into consideration also that there's some really
[00:29:04.400 --> 00:29:05.400]   interesting verticals.
[00:29:05.400 --> 00:29:15.240]   So I mean, take a look at using VR as a way of acclimatizing people to phobias that they
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:16.240]   got.
[00:29:16.240 --> 00:29:18.640]   This is something that I'm sure Georgia can speak to a lot better than I can.
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:19.640]   Yeah.
[00:29:19.640 --> 00:29:20.640]   But PTSD, right?
[00:29:20.640 --> 00:29:21.640]   I mean, that's true.
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:22.640]   Yeah.
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:23.640]   Yeah.
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:26.720]   No, for that, first go into surgeries.
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:32.360]   And before they've already used AR in order to take a look at cranium sizes and what are
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:34.720]   they going to go in and how are they going to deal with surgery?
[00:29:34.720 --> 00:29:40.640]   We talked to a pediatric cardiologist who actually did a 3D rendering of the baby's
[00:29:40.640 --> 00:29:41.640]   heart.
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:46.320]   They did a scan of it and then practiced or explored the heart so that he'd know what
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:48.840]   he was going to see when he actually did the surgery.
[00:29:48.840 --> 00:29:49.840]   Yeah.
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:50.840]   But those are niches.
[00:29:50.840 --> 00:29:52.320]   But I mean, I'm not saying bad news.
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:55.960]   It could be for training for many things.
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:29:59.960]   Like again, the closer that we are to reality, the better we are going to simulate the real
[00:29:59.960 --> 00:30:02.120]   thing once we go out and use it.
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:07.320]   And Peter's right, the same thing for phobias, for post-traumatic stress, for social anxiety,
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:08.760]   for flight simulators.
[00:30:08.760 --> 00:30:12.560]   Again, the closer we can get to actually being there, the better we're going to be able to
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:14.000]   deal with that.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.560]   And also interacting with other people in ways that we couldn't do it before going able
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:22.080]   to actually see things that are happening on the other side and interact with that.
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:23.400]   I think that it's really cool.
[00:30:23.400 --> 00:30:27.640]   I just still think that we are far off from it being accepted and mainstream.
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:31.560]   And I think that those are always things that Apple likes to have in play before they decide
[00:30:31.560 --> 00:30:32.560]   to jump into a field.
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:36.520]   Robert, you and Shell wrote your newest book, "The Fourth Transformation, How Augmented
[00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:40.640]   Reality and Artificial Intelligence Will Change Everything."
[00:30:40.640 --> 00:30:48.560]   What do you see, Apple aside, whatever, do you see us kind of all, do you see people
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:51.840]   wearing augmented reality glasses like all day?
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:52.840]   Or is it another?
[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:53.840]   Yes.
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:54.840]   Okay.
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:30:55.840]   So it's not just another interface to your computer.
[00:30:55.840 --> 00:30:57.320]   It's something you would wear around.
[00:30:57.320 --> 00:30:58.320]   Yes.
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:03.600]   If you give me enough years, I eat four years, yes.
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:09.120]   Yeah, I think we can argue about the specifics of who's going to do it and how soon.
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:13.000]   But I think what we can probably all agree on is that this is an interface that might
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   have some interest.
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:19.280]   But to answer Peter's question, is this something that's going to have mass appeal to a general
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:20.760]   audience?
[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:22.680]   I believe so.
[00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:29.920]   In going around to R&D Labs, for instance, going to Sephora, which is a big cosmetic retailer,
[00:31:29.920 --> 00:31:34.920]   they're already using augmented reality in their iPhone app and they're building augmented
[00:31:34.920 --> 00:31:41.680]   reality experiences for going into the store with these glasses and looking at people who
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:45.120]   are wearing Sephora makeup with these glasses in some form.
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:48.840]   They're getting ready for this and they already have it working on the iPhone.
[00:31:48.840 --> 00:31:50.760]   So you can download the Sephora app.
[00:31:50.760 --> 00:31:55.400]   This is always a challenge with new technologies because when they first emerge, they're toy-like.
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:57.480]   And so it's deceptive.
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:02.920]   You look at Atari 2600 video games ago, well, that's never going to go anywhere.
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:03.920]   So we're in the early stages.
[00:32:03.920 --> 00:32:08.520]   I just had to inter with Ted Shillowitz at the 20th Century Fox's Futurist, the movie's
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:10.240]   company's Futurist.
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:14.440]   And he says it's coming and coming soon, like within the next 18 months.
[00:32:14.440 --> 00:32:16.880]   And he's very excited about this area.
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:20.240]   And he's invested in some of the companies that are going to compete with Apple.
[00:32:20.240 --> 00:32:23.840]   Yeah, if I were a content creator, I'd be very interested for sure, right?
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:25.320]   Yeah.
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:29.240]   If you go to Ford, they already designed cars in virtual reality.
[00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:34.760]   If you go to Disney, their new park in Shanghai, China was completely designed in virtual reality.
[00:32:34.760 --> 00:32:36.160]   That's been going on for years though.
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:38.680]   That's been going on almost for a decade.
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:39.680]   That's not new.
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:45.120]   What is happening is the mobile industry is driving the prices and the sizes way down.
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:52.280]   I just sat next to a guy who's a strategist that applied materials who makes the machines
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:53.520]   that make our chips.
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:57.120]   And he says, right now we're at 10 nanometer.
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:33:00.520]   He says, next year, CES, you're going to see seven nanometer.
[00:33:00.520 --> 00:33:04.800]   So in one year, you're seeing everything shrink by 30% in size.
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:05.800]   Right.
[00:33:05.800 --> 00:33:06.800]   And that's what you saw.
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:10.880]   That's what holding HoloLens back is the need to get a full computer and battery into
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:11.880]   the visor.
[00:33:11.880 --> 00:33:12.880]   Right.
[00:33:12.880 --> 00:33:18.960]   But ODG showed a full computer and battery in four ounce glasses that are already being
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:19.960]   shown.
[00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:20.960]   Right.
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:23.080]   So we know that startups can do it.
[00:33:23.080 --> 00:33:26.640]   The big boys are going to do it in the next 18 months.
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:28.120]   And it's not just Apple.
[00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:32.480]   It's Google just bought iFluenced, which big iCensor company that's going to be part of
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:33.880]   these glasses.
[00:33:33.880 --> 00:33:36.120]   And Facebook bought iDrive, which is iCensor.
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:38.600]   So they're building a pair of glasses.
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:40.040]   Microsoft is obviously building them.
[00:33:40.040 --> 00:33:42.320]   Google's building them and on and on.
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:48.280]   So you're going to see many companies in the next 18 months uncloque and ship new products
[00:33:48.280 --> 00:33:52.600]   that are going to be in the two to four ounce size of glasses that are going to look like
[00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:54.080]   the Snapchat glasses.
[00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:55.560]   It's exciting.
[00:33:55.560 --> 00:33:56.560]   Yeah.
[00:33:56.560 --> 00:33:57.560]   Let's take a break.
[00:33:57.560 --> 00:34:02.080]   Robert Daskoebel is here, author of the fourth transformation, brand new book available
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:06.120]   on Amazon at scobilizer.com.
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:11.920]   Peter Cohen is also with us from many different places, including Backblaze.com where he is.
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:14.560]   You do content at Backblaze?
[00:34:14.560 --> 00:34:16.880]   I am the vlog editor at Backblaze.
[00:34:16.880 --> 00:34:17.880]   That's cool.
[00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:18.880]   Mm-hmm.
[00:34:18.880 --> 00:34:19.880]   That's fun.
[00:34:19.880 --> 00:34:24.440]   And of course, Georgia Dow, who is the creator of all of these great videos, which your partner
[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:25.440]   Sandra sent to me.
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:27.880]   And I'm so grateful.
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:31.200]   Sandra is the clinical director of the Montreal Center for Anxiety and Depression.
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:36.040]   And Georgia, of course, as you know, is a psychotherapist who specializes in healing
[00:34:36.040 --> 00:34:37.040]   anxiety.
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:40.200]   You've done it for us today, Georgia.
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:43.120]   All of these videos are available at anxiety-videos.com.
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:44.680]   So I'm excited.
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:45.680]   This is great.
[00:34:45.680 --> 00:34:46.680]   Great stuff.
[00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:47.680]   Where should I start?
[00:34:47.680 --> 00:34:48.680]   Probably session one.
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:49.680]   He just...
[00:34:49.680 --> 00:34:53.080]   He started with session one, and then the special series, you can use them on your own.
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:34:57.200]   So the one on sleep, you can just watch the video on sleep, the one on parenting.
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:58.600]   You can just watch on parenting.
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:34:59.600]   I'm done with parenting.
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:00.600]   I don't...
[00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:02.600]   My kids are lost to me, so...
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:03.600]   [laughter]
[00:35:03.600 --> 00:35:05.400]   When are you done with parenting?
[00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:06.800]   You're 24 and 22.
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:07.800]   I think it's done.
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:08.800]   You're never really done.
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:09.800]   You're never really done.
[00:35:09.800 --> 00:35:12.800]   But you don't have the same responsibility as you had before.
[00:35:12.800 --> 00:35:14.800]   So you've done most of the work already.
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:16.600]   Now this is the expensive part.
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:20.280]   I don't know about responsibility, but I'm writing a lot of checks.
[00:35:20.280 --> 00:35:21.280]   Let's put it that way.
[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:24.360]   Our show today brought to you by Zipper Cruder.
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:30.040]   If you are hiring, if you're in that enviable and yet somehow unenviable position of having
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:33.400]   to do the hiring at your company, you ought to know about Zipper Cruder.
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:37.120]   Because Zipper Cruder takes all the pain out and makes you, even more importantly, more
[00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:40.640]   effective at finding just the right person.
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:47.840]   Let's stipulate for the moment that there is a perfect person for that job opening.
[00:35:47.840 --> 00:35:48.840]   There's somebody...
[00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:51.440]   If you hired them, it would make such a difference in your company.
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:53.000]   It could transform your company.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:56.680]   And we could also probably, from experience now, that there might be people that would
[00:35:56.680 --> 00:35:58.160]   be less good in that job.
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:00.120]   Maybe some that would actually hurt your company.
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:02.120]   So how do you get to the right person?
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:03.840]   You don't know what job boards they're reading.
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:05.480]   You don't know where they are.
[00:36:05.480 --> 00:36:06.680]   You need help.
[00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:08.280]   And that's where Zipper Cruder is amazing.
[00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:14.520]   One post to Zipper Cruder puts your job listing on 200+ job boards, including Twitter and
[00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:16.880]   Facebook.
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:19.240]   And then don't worry.
[00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:20.520]   Sometimes people go, "I don't want that.
[00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:22.960]   I'm going to have 100 million emails and phone calls."
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:26.960]   No, it all goes into the Zipper Cruder interface, which is great because not only does it make
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:32.440]   it easy to sort through all your applicants, they pre-format the resumes so their uniform,
[00:36:32.440 --> 00:36:33.640]   it's easy to read.
[00:36:33.640 --> 00:36:36.400]   You could set up questions, screening questions.
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:39.240]   True, false, yes, no.
[00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:40.760]   Multiple choice essay questions.
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:44.680]   So you can automatically kind of narrow down the candidates.
[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:46.120]   Thumbs up and thumbs down.
[00:36:46.120 --> 00:36:47.520]   Screen them, rate them.
[00:36:47.520 --> 00:36:48.800]   Hire the right person fast.
[00:36:48.800 --> 00:36:50.680]   That right person is out there.
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:53.680]   This is the best way to find that person.
[00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:55.680]   Zipper Cruder has been used by the Fortune 100 companies.
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:59.080]   Thousands of small and medium sized businesses.
[00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:00.080]   It's just fantastic.
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:01.080]   We've used it.
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:04.080]   A million companies now use Zipper Cruder to do their hiring.
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:05.240]   You should try it.
[00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:12.360]   Go to zippercruder.com/twit for a free trial, zippercruder.com/twit.
[00:37:12.360 --> 00:37:15.840]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.
[00:37:15.840 --> 00:37:17.000]   Robert and I are good friends.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.360]   Don't think we have fun yelling at each other.
[00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:21.360]   Actually, I don't think-
[00:37:21.360 --> 00:37:22.360]   We like debating.
[00:37:22.360 --> 00:37:23.360]   We like debating.
[00:37:23.360 --> 00:37:24.360]   And frankly-
[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:27.560]   We're like this when we get together for dinner.
[00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:32.360]   The thing about Robert, which is true is he's an enthusiast.
[00:37:32.360 --> 00:37:34.080]   You love new technologies.
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:38.400]   And sometimes I think that that clouds your judgment as to whether that new technology
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:42.320]   is going to happen and whether it'll be as interesting as its potential is.
[00:37:42.320 --> 00:37:46.080]   I don't think anybody denies the potential for AR and VR is huge.
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:49.440]   I thought Google Glass was going to be more important than it did in that.
[00:37:49.440 --> 00:37:50.440]   That's a good example.
[00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:52.400]   I bought it.
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:54.440]   I put my money where your mouth was.
[00:37:54.440 --> 00:37:56.400]   I wore it for a year though.
[00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:57.400]   That sounds really-
[00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:02.800]   That's some traumatized image of you wearing Google Glass in the shower.
[00:38:02.800 --> 00:38:04.280]   He's done it now with everything.
[00:38:04.280 --> 00:38:06.680]   You wore your Snapchat goggles in the shower, I think.
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:08.480]   That's going to be on my grave.
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:09.480]   Really?
[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:10.480]   Just that is the-
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:11.480]   Yeah.
[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:15.400]   Oh, was yours that photo of the person that was going to wear it forever?
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:17.400]   Was that you?
[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:18.400]   Yeah.
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:20.680]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:21.680]   That's great.
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:22.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:23.680]   That's his claim to fame.
[00:38:23.680 --> 00:38:24.680]   Sorry, Robert.
[00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:25.680]   I'm sorry.
[00:38:25.680 --> 00:38:26.680]   Oh, there we go.
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:27.680]   There we go.
[00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:32.760]   Magic Leap actually used it in its filings in its patent.
[00:38:32.760 --> 00:38:33.760]   It's in its filings.
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:35.680]   Oh, look at that.
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:37.240]   Is that wild or what?
[00:38:37.240 --> 00:38:38.240]   Yeah.
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:40.600]   That image is going to outlast me by a long shot.
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:41.600]   You're a sketch.
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:43.600]   I've tweeted out your image.
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:44.600]   Yeah.
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:45.600]   When I wrote an article-
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:46.600]   And she didn't even know it.
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:47.600]   Yeah.
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:48.600]   Why Google Glass failed?
[00:38:48.600 --> 00:38:50.600]   Because of Robert.
[00:38:50.600 --> 00:38:51.600]   A lot of people thought it was-
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:52.600]   No, no, it was not.
[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:53.600]   No, I didn't think it was like that.
[00:38:53.600 --> 00:38:55.240]   A lot of people thought it was Robert.
[00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:56.240]   That's what-
[00:38:56.240 --> 00:38:57.240]   That was the death.
[00:38:57.240 --> 00:38:58.840]   They're wrong, but that's okay.
[00:38:58.840 --> 00:38:59.840]   I think you're-
[00:38:59.840 --> 00:39:00.840]   A good product.
[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:02.600]   In fact, I'll say this.
[00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:04.840]   A great product will survive my shower.
[00:39:04.840 --> 00:39:06.800]   Have you seen Magic Leap?
[00:39:06.800 --> 00:39:08.920]   Has anybody seen Magic Leap actually?
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:14.020]   I have not, but I've talked to more than 50 people who have seen it, including Ted
[00:39:14.020 --> 00:39:16.520]   Shillowitz who's seen it several times because he's one of the-
[00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:21.520]   Because there's really a question about whether this is how real this really is.
[00:39:21.520 --> 00:39:27.600]   Kevin Kelly wrote a long piece in Wired Magazine kind of singing its praises, but no one-
[00:39:27.600 --> 00:39:30.920]   Just a handful of people actually tried the technology.
[00:39:30.920 --> 00:39:35.240]   And lately it's kind of come out that the technology they tried is nothing like what
[00:39:35.240 --> 00:39:36.560]   Magic Leap promises.
[00:39:36.560 --> 00:39:38.920]   It requires a massive computer, big wires.
[00:39:38.920 --> 00:39:39.920]   But-
[00:39:39.920 --> 00:39:44.520]   And in fact, they may be having trouble with the central technology and all this.
[00:39:44.520 --> 00:39:49.200]   What he is building is a pair of mixed reality glasses.
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:52.840]   The secret sauce is the optics.
[00:39:52.840 --> 00:39:57.800]   What he was trying to do was make it so that images could refocus as they get closer to
[00:39:57.800 --> 00:39:58.800]   you.
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:40:03.800]   And the earlier optic would show six levels of depth and the new optic only shows two
[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:04.800]   levels of depth.
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:07.840]   So they give away some of the secret sauce.
[00:40:07.840 --> 00:40:11.640]   But Ted says Magic Leap is still going to shock the world.
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:12.640]   So-
[00:40:12.640 --> 00:40:14.640]   Look, we want these companies-
[00:40:14.640 --> 00:40:16.160]   I can't edit against it yet.
[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:19.200]   Yeah, and we want these companies to try to do these moonshots.
[00:40:19.200 --> 00:40:20.200]   I mean, of course.
[00:40:20.200 --> 00:40:21.200]   Yeah.
[00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:22.200]   Because-
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:26.040]   They have only $4 billion without that product and without a customer.
[00:40:26.040 --> 00:40:28.560]   So that tells you some things going on.
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:29.560]   Yeah.
[00:40:29.560 --> 00:40:36.080]   And of course, as Apple has proven, if you can trap lightning in a bottle, it can power
[00:40:36.080 --> 00:40:37.560]   you for years to come.
[00:40:37.560 --> 00:40:40.880]   I mean, 10 years, Apple's been making money on the iPhone.
[00:40:40.880 --> 00:40:43.280]   And this last quarter shows they're still making quite a bit.
[00:40:43.280 --> 00:40:46.040]   This is an unusual time in the industry.
[00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:50.640]   And I think this is why Apple is going to behave differently than it did before.
[00:40:50.640 --> 00:40:56.600]   You know, when Apple started up, Waz told me that everybody ignored the personal computer
[00:40:56.600 --> 00:40:58.320]   industry for a couple of years.
[00:40:58.320 --> 00:41:00.520]   Including his bosses, right?
[00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:04.200]   He worked at HP and he said, "I just worked at HP forever.
[00:41:04.200 --> 00:41:07.960]   I want to let HP build my motherfords."
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:12.040]   And he tried to get the bosses at HP to build a personal computer and they said, "Nobody's
[00:41:12.040 --> 00:41:13.040]   ever going to buy them."
[00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:18.400]   Sort of like the skepticism around whether Apple can really change the world again.
[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:21.720]   Yeah, sometimes big companies are not the best places for these new ideas.
[00:41:21.720 --> 00:41:27.080]   Let's say speaking of big companies, Facebook announced it's quarterly results from Q3
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:29.640]   2016.
[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:33.080]   Another huge success for Facebook.
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:38.800]   But what's really interesting, 84% of their total sales revenue came from mobile.
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:42.040]   This was the question mark with Facebook, when they went public.
[00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:47.800]   And Robert, to your credit, you've been saying Facebook's the one for at least a year, a
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:49.800]   couple of years.
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:55.320]   Daily active users, 1.18 billion daily active users.
[00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:56.640]   Unbelievable.
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:59.680]   Monthly active users, 1.8 billion.
[00:41:59.680 --> 00:42:03.560]   That's a roughly 16 or 70% increase year over year.
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:06.800]   Mobile active users every month, 1.66.
[00:42:06.800 --> 00:42:15.520]   So mobile is clearly, this is where Facebook lives and this is where you want to live.
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:17.320]   Anything to say about that?
[00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:19.960]   You want to take a victory lap, Robert, or anything?
[00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:23.400]   No, I'm going to save the victory lap for June.
[00:42:23.400 --> 00:42:24.400]   June.
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:25.400]   I'll have you back.
[00:42:25.400 --> 00:42:27.000]   I'll have you part of it.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   You know what?
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:33.080]   Apple, first of all, this will be the first announcement in the round building, right?
[00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:34.080]   Yeah.
[00:42:34.080 --> 00:42:38.440]   I talked to somebody who is working on the building.
[00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:43.600]   I talked to a few people who work on the building and they say it's unbelievable inside.
[00:42:43.600 --> 00:42:49.880]   They said that more new technology went into the building or designed the building and
[00:42:49.880 --> 00:42:52.960]   what's inside the building than any other building in the world.
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:57.680]   So that's going to be quite something to see alone, right?
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:01.120]   If you got an invite to go see that for the first time, I think you would go.
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:02.120]   I would certainly go.
[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:03.120]   I'm going to bet.
[00:43:03.120 --> 00:43:06.680]   I haven't been invited to one of these events in a long time, but I'm going to beg for an
[00:43:06.680 --> 00:43:07.880]   invite to this first event.
[00:43:07.880 --> 00:43:10.080]   I already started begging, baby.
[00:43:10.080 --> 00:43:12.880]   Well, I think you'll get in.
[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:16.120]   If not, we'll be on Twitter talking about it, right?
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:22.080]   We'll sit outside on the street in Cupertino saying, "I don't know what's going on inside."
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:23.080]   I do.
[00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:24.080]   Does make sense.
[00:43:24.080 --> 00:43:26.440]   Will they make an announcement?
[00:43:26.440 --> 00:43:30.520]   We know there'll be an iPad announcement, probably a new max announcement, probably in
[00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:32.240]   March.
[00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:35.400]   You think this is when they would announce this or you think it's more like June?
[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:42.640]   I think it's June because they need to show off the expansiveness of their vision about
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:47.000]   mixed reality and all that.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.920]   The iPad will have a prime sense sensor in it.
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:55.280]   They're going to probably ship it really fast so that developers have something to build
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:44:00.440]   games and other things for the new iPhone and the new glasses and the new iPad coming
[00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:02.440]   out.
[00:44:02.440 --> 00:44:07.160]   I won't be shocked that in June they announced it and then they say, "Oh, the iPad is available
[00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:08.920]   right now," or within two.
[00:44:08.920 --> 00:44:10.080]   Christmas you can get it.
[00:44:10.080 --> 00:44:13.920]   It's in September, October, like it usually does.
[00:44:13.920 --> 00:44:19.760]   The glasses come later or come with the phone too.
[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:23.000]   I won't be shocked if they all come at one time.
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:29.760]   The real problem and you're starting to see senses of this is they don't know that they
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:31.160]   can make enough.
[00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:35.800]   In fact, I'll say they can't make enough because, like you said, they sold 78 million
[00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:42.400]   iPhones last quarter alone and anything that looks at all cool is going to drive that number
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:43.880]   up this year.
[00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:50.480]   Let's say they do have an expansive new phone that's clear that you look through and do
[00:44:50.480 --> 00:44:55.240]   Pokemon hunting and you put it in a headset and play VR and play AR.
[00:44:55.240 --> 00:45:00.880]   That alone is going to drive sales double of what they were last quarter.
[00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:05.600]   They can't get enough screens to make 150 million iPhones right now.
[00:45:05.600 --> 00:45:06.600]   What is going on?
[00:45:06.600 --> 00:45:07.600]   It's not just Apple.
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:13.600]   Apple wasn't able to make the AirPods in any quantity and fulfill demand at any reasonable
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:14.600]   time frame.
[00:45:14.600 --> 00:45:18.360]   Google's having a lot of trouble making it's, and they're not even selling anywhere near
[00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:19.800]   those units.
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:23.360]   The Google Pixel, it's been out of stock for a while.
[00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:24.360]   I can go on and on.
[00:45:24.360 --> 00:45:27.360]   A lot of these products are, what's going on?
[00:45:27.360 --> 00:45:33.440]   Why is it hard to make, to meet demand these days?
[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:35.760]   It's hard to build things that are physical.
[00:45:35.760 --> 00:45:42.560]   When you think about moving around 100 million pieces of glass and 100 million sensors and
[00:45:42.560 --> 00:45:49.760]   100 million GPUs and all the pieces that go into a phone, that's not easy.
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:53.800]   It's not easy for Apple who does the best on the market.
[00:45:53.800 --> 00:45:59.120]   I guess the note, the problems that Samsung had with the Note 7 are an example.
[00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:03.400]   You've seen what happens when they're able to ship a whole bunch at this time.
[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:04.400]   There's problems.
[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:08.160]   It's better to take longer.
[00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:10.240]   It also brings up demand.
[00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:14.080]   Then it also says, "Oh, we have shortages, which makes people want to buy them more."
[00:46:14.080 --> 00:46:15.920]   It seems more sought after.
[00:46:15.920 --> 00:46:18.720]   That already has really helped push.
[00:46:18.720 --> 00:46:21.800]   You think that they're faking it, Peter?
[00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:23.800]   Sometimes I do.
[00:46:23.800 --> 00:46:27.600]   Tim Cook is the supply line master.
[00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:32.680]   That was his reputation as CEO of Apple.
[00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:35.760]   He assumed the reins from Steve.
[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:41.840]   I don't think that anything in Apple's supply line is out of Apple's control or out of Apple's
[00:46:41.840 --> 00:46:44.760]   management most of the time.
[00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:49.720]   I do think that it benefits them to exit quarters with a healthy backlog of orders for
[00:46:49.720 --> 00:46:55.360]   products that haven't shipped because it does create the illusion of scarcity, the illusion
[00:46:55.360 --> 00:47:02.800]   of higher demand and then there would need to be if production was ramped up to equal
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:03.800]   it.
[00:47:03.800 --> 00:47:04.800]   I think it benefits them.
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:07.720]   I think that they've done it for a very long time, very effectively.
[00:47:07.720 --> 00:47:10.160]   By the way, Robert, I will buy you...
[00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:12.320]   What can I buy, Robert?
[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:13.320]   Something that would...
[00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:19.680]   I will buy you dinner at Joelle Rubichand in the city of your choosing.
[00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:20.680]   Paris.
[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:24.680]   The Paris Rubichand is beautiful.
[00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:34.520]   Yeah, and they have these badass matter lines that they serve in the trade where they actually
[00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:35.520]   make them.
[00:47:35.520 --> 00:47:36.520]   They're just glorious.
[00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:37.520]   All right.
[00:47:37.520 --> 00:47:39.760]   So I will buy you...
[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:45.320]   You and me dinner in Paris at Joelle Rubichand if Apple ships a clear iPhone.
[00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:46.320]   This year.
[00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:47.320]   This year.
[00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:48.320]   This year.
[00:47:48.320 --> 00:47:49.320]   By the end.
[00:47:49.320 --> 00:47:54.160]   You mean an iPhone that you can look through and if I held it up here, I would see you on
[00:47:54.160 --> 00:47:55.160]   the other side.
[00:47:55.160 --> 00:47:56.160]   Yes.
[00:47:56.160 --> 00:47:58.360]   If they do that, I will buy you dinner in Paris.
[00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:01.560]   Yeah, you have a patent out there that explains how it works.
[00:48:01.560 --> 00:48:07.640]   But my friends who are in the industry and have seen the prototypes say it's a clear piece
[00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:09.800]   of glass with a pack at the bottom.
[00:48:09.800 --> 00:48:12.880]   Yeah, obviously there's somewhere you have to put the electronics.
[00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:14.040]   But the clear policing...
[00:48:14.040 --> 00:48:15.040]   And there's...
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:17.280]   So there are screens.
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:20.080]   There are screens now that you can see through.
[00:48:20.080 --> 00:48:21.080]   Absolutely.
[00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:28.920]   If you go to Samsung's museum, all of the displays are clear, displays and they turn
[00:48:28.920 --> 00:48:32.320]   clear so that you can see the object that's being in glass.
[00:48:32.320 --> 00:48:34.720]   And then they superimpose something on top of it.
[00:48:34.720 --> 00:48:35.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:39.960]   Or does it go completely opaque before it can be a screen?
[00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:42.680]   No, it can be either way, right?
[00:48:42.680 --> 00:48:48.000]   So you could have an icon floating on a paint of glass so you could see it.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   Yes.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   Yes.
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   Wow.
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:53.880]   I'm going to be happy to buy you dinner in Paris if that comes out.
[00:48:53.880 --> 00:48:55.760]   I will be thrilled.
[00:48:55.760 --> 00:48:57.360]   And get a phone in the process.
[00:48:57.360 --> 00:48:58.360]   Yeah, well...
[00:48:58.360 --> 00:49:00.400]   Now Robert, you have to offer something if it doesn't happen though.
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:01.400]   Oh, no, no.
[00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:04.640]   I'm not going to put Robert in the spot.
[00:49:04.640 --> 00:49:06.640]   A firm handshake.
[00:49:06.640 --> 00:49:11.640]   You can come back on the show and give me a hearty handshake.
[00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:16.280]   Well, my career will be in tatters if none of this comes along.
[00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:18.280]   No, it's not going to be...
[00:49:18.280 --> 00:49:20.280]   As many of us have learned...
[00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:22.000]   Robert, go and whip her a little bit.
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:26.360]   It's good to make wild project projections because nobody remembers if you're wrong.
[00:49:26.360 --> 00:49:28.440]   But if you're right, everybody remembers that.
[00:49:28.440 --> 00:49:29.440]   Oh, they do.
[00:49:29.440 --> 00:49:31.320]   They all remember you're wrong or right.
[00:49:31.320 --> 00:49:33.960]   You get a few tweets out, but that's it.
[00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:34.960]   Peter, have you ever made a...
[00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:35.960]   You've never made a...
[00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:36.960]   You've moved on much quicker.
[00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:37.960]   That's right.
[00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:40.920]   Now in the world of Twitter, nothing lasts for more than 10 minutes.
[00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:41.920]   Yeah.
[00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:43.880]   Have you ever made a prediction, Peter?
[00:49:43.880 --> 00:49:46.280]   Do you do predictions?
[00:49:46.280 --> 00:49:47.280]   That was a great failure.
[00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:50.800]   No, I really don't.
[00:49:50.800 --> 00:49:52.240]   I'm no good at them.
[00:49:52.240 --> 00:49:53.240]   Me neither.
[00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:56.120]   My predictions are always wags.
[00:49:56.120 --> 00:49:57.520]   What's a wag?
[00:49:57.520 --> 00:49:58.520]   Wildass guess?
[00:49:58.520 --> 00:49:59.520]   Wildass guess.
[00:49:59.520 --> 00:50:00.520]   Yes.
[00:50:00.520 --> 00:50:01.520]   Yes.
[00:50:01.520 --> 00:50:02.680]   I make wild-ass guesses all the time.
[00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:04.120]   Here's a picture.
[00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:06.880]   John is handing me on his clear phone of...
[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:11.880]   Back in 2006, I guess John had a clear iMac.
[00:50:11.880 --> 00:50:12.880]   Look at that.
[00:50:12.880 --> 00:50:16.040]   You can see right through it to the woods beyond.
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:18.280]   Remember that when we all did that with our Macs?
[00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:21.240]   You take a picture of what's behind the Mac and you make that your wallpaper.
[00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:22.240]   Yeah.
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:24.520]   That doesn't count, Robert.
[00:50:24.520 --> 00:50:26.680]   That's mostly Renee's Instagram feed right now.
[00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:29.440]   Yeah, that's not dinner in Paris I'm looking at right there, Robert.
[00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:30.440]   I'm telling you right now.
[00:50:30.440 --> 00:50:31.440]   There might be...
[00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:36.160]   And I'll grant you this, that even if it's a clear piece of glass, you need to hide things
[00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:37.880]   along the edges, right?
[00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:41.400]   Wires, batteries, maybe antennas, stuff like that.
[00:50:41.400 --> 00:50:43.640]   Yeah, they'll be a big-ass bezel.
[00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:50.280]   I won't be shot, and by the way, the lower-end phones will still do mixed reality but won't
[00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:51.280]   be clear like that.
[00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:58.320]   So I won't be shocked if they do trickery in conjunction with also having a clear piece
[00:50:58.320 --> 00:50:59.320]   of glass.
[00:50:59.320 --> 00:51:00.320]   But we'll see.
[00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:01.320]   We'll see.
[00:51:01.320 --> 00:51:02.320]   Right.
[00:51:02.320 --> 00:51:03.320]   I have to tell you guys.
[00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:04.320]   I don't know.
[00:51:04.320 --> 00:51:09.760]   I just don't care about a clear iPhone at all.
[00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:14.960]   But I want them to do the iPhone and the ultraviolet purple color that they've got for the new
[00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:15.960]   Beats headphones.
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:16.960]   That's what I want.
[00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:19.880]   Give me ultraviolet purple, please.
[00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:22.800]   It actually does ask that there raised an interesting question.
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:25.800]   You can make it but does it mean people will want it?
[00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:28.200]   Well, people wanted you.
[00:51:28.200 --> 00:51:29.200]   I'm not.
[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:32.960]   People, you know, they took the headphone jack out and people clearly were not deterred
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:33.960]   by that.
[00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:35.160]   I'm kind of surprised, frankly.
[00:51:35.160 --> 00:51:37.080]   I thought that was a...
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:44.280]   The lack of headphone jack making a lot of sense next this year because they removed
[00:51:44.280 --> 00:51:46.120]   it for a reason.
[00:51:46.120 --> 00:51:50.360]   That's the one argument I counted, which is that they didn't want to distract from this
[00:51:50.360 --> 00:51:54.400]   year's phone by going doing too much.
[00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:56.720]   So they thought, well, we're going to take the hit in 2016.
[00:51:56.720 --> 00:52:01.800]   We'll move the jack then because we would have had to by 2017 anyway.
[00:52:01.800 --> 00:52:03.480]   And then people will have forgotten.
[00:52:03.480 --> 00:52:06.800]   And it didn't hurt the sales, obviously.
[00:52:06.800 --> 00:52:10.680]   And it probably helps the sales of Apple's Beats and other Bluetooth headsets, including
[00:52:10.680 --> 00:52:11.680]   the AirPods.
[00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:13.680]   So I'm sure it's...
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:17.720]   Microsoft, Apple is moving toward a wireless world from what I'm hearing.
[00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:21.040]   And I haven't confirmed this so I can't say it's happening definitely.
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:26.640]   But it certainly makes sense that we're going to see wireless power in a new way delivered
[00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:28.120]   on these new devices.
[00:52:28.120 --> 00:52:30.240]   Yeah, we've been talking about this on Macbreak Weekly.
[00:52:30.240 --> 00:52:32.000]   And this one I really don't buy.
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:36.760]   Renee's talked about in others.
[00:52:36.760 --> 00:52:39.000]   The wireless charging, where you don't actually have to put the phone on anything, it just
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   goes...
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:41.760]   It charges it across the room.
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:47.040]   I was at Qualcomm getting a tour of their R&D lab and they showed me wireless charging
[00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:49.400]   in a number of different ways.
[00:52:49.400 --> 00:52:52.840]   You don't need to lay anything on top of anything anymore.
[00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:57.280]   The receiver of the power is going to be built into the phone or into your glasses or
[00:52:57.280 --> 00:52:58.880]   into your watch.
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:53:03.680]   And it'll receive power from some distance.
[00:53:03.680 --> 00:53:06.560]   I don't know how much that distance is.
[00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:10.000]   Qualcomm said it was a few feet.
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:12.400]   But does Apple have something better than that?
[00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:15.600]   So this to me violates the rules of physics.
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:20.360]   Remember the energy dissipates by the inverse of the square.
[00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:24.920]   Very rapidly reduces over a short distance.
[00:53:24.920 --> 00:53:26.480]   It's not going to be feet.
[00:53:26.480 --> 00:53:28.320]   If anything, it's going to be inches.
[00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:32.800]   The amount of energy you would have to pump out of that thing to charge a phone three
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:36.080]   feet away will kill you.
[00:53:36.080 --> 00:53:38.120]   You will have cancer.
[00:53:38.120 --> 00:53:39.120]   It's not a good idea.
[00:53:39.120 --> 00:53:40.760]   I disagree.
[00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:45.480]   The people who are working on it, there's a kid at Stanford who has a lab that is working
[00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:46.480]   on it.
[00:53:46.480 --> 00:53:52.080]   And there's a company called Ubeam and others who are working on wireless transmission.
[00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:53.080]   They can...
[00:53:53.080 --> 00:53:54.080]   Ubeam has been debunked.
[00:53:54.080 --> 00:53:55.080]   Ubeam has been debunked.
[00:53:55.080 --> 00:53:58.280]   Ubeam wanted to do it sonically.
[00:53:58.280 --> 00:53:59.600]   It was not debunked.
[00:53:59.600 --> 00:54:05.200]   And this week alone, they just showed off to the press how it works.
[00:54:05.200 --> 00:54:08.280]   And everybody says, "Oh shit, we were wrong about this."
[00:54:08.280 --> 00:54:15.440]   So look at the Verge or other companies about Ubeam and you'll see that the journalists
[00:54:15.440 --> 00:54:18.480]   sought this week and said it works.
[00:54:18.480 --> 00:54:23.080]   But anyways, there's stuff coming and we'll see how good it is.
[00:54:23.080 --> 00:54:29.560]   Qualcomm, Broadcom, both showed me wireless power that doesn't need to be touching.
[00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:32.200]   And a coil or something like that.
[00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:37.560]   So we're going to see new kinds of wireless power that can go further than just a few
[00:54:37.560 --> 00:54:38.560]   inches.
[00:54:38.560 --> 00:54:39.560]   >> So the Ubeam...
[00:54:39.560 --> 00:54:43.760]   >> But I don't even mind if it's just like the Qi, like just sitting onto a pad or a
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:44.760]   table.
[00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:45.760]   >> Yeah, if you have to take...
[00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:46.760]   >> I just don't...
[00:54:46.760 --> 00:54:48.680]   Yeah, which is absolutely fine for me.
[00:54:48.680 --> 00:54:52.360]   My issue with charging is just having to actually insert a device.
[00:54:52.360 --> 00:54:56.360]   I'm trying to get it in and it's dark and I'm like, "Where's the stupid wire?"
[00:54:56.360 --> 00:54:59.200]   Like I wouldn't mind if I just placed it on a certain table.
[00:54:59.200 --> 00:55:01.160]   >> Here's the video of the Ubeam demo.
[00:55:01.160 --> 00:55:03.720]   This was by the way...
[00:55:03.720 --> 00:55:05.520]   Everybody was told it's off the record.
[00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:08.680]   So apparently you can't tell people.
[00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:09.680]   So she's holding it.
[00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:11.720]   How many inches away?
[00:55:11.720 --> 00:55:12.720]   A few inches away.
[00:55:12.720 --> 00:55:15.080]   >> So close, it might as well be just sitting on the...
[00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:16.080]   >> Yeah, I don't see...
[00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:17.080]   Yeah, maybe...
[00:55:17.080 --> 00:55:18.080]   Okay.
[00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:19.080]   So...
[00:55:19.080 --> 00:55:20.080]   >> What's the use...
[00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:21.080]   Like that's not...
[00:55:21.080 --> 00:55:22.080]   It's not far enough away that it makes it actually useful.
[00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:23.080]   >> Just have it placed on top of...
[00:55:23.080 --> 00:55:25.360]   >> You just remember, you got energy.
[00:55:25.360 --> 00:55:29.640]   You got to send a lot of energy through the air and it's...
[00:55:29.640 --> 00:55:31.640]   Well, we'll see.
[00:55:31.640 --> 00:55:33.640]   I'll believe it when I see it.
[00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:37.360]   >> More air, fire, dirt, F&I phones, how do they work?
[00:55:37.360 --> 00:55:38.360]   >> How do they work?
[00:55:38.360 --> 00:55:39.360]   No one knows.
[00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:42.200]   >> You know, it's cool and all.
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:49.040]   But is it actually like a practical solution to a problem that everybody's having?
[00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:50.320]   I know that there's a lot...
[00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:53.880]   >> Yeah, I like wireless charging, but I don't mind putting it on a...
[00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:55.840]   I got a little stand put on there and it charges.
[00:55:55.840 --> 00:55:56.840]   It works.
[00:55:56.840 --> 00:55:57.840]   I don't mind that.
[00:55:57.840 --> 00:56:01.720]   >> I've got the Apple watch and it uses inductive charging.
[00:56:01.720 --> 00:56:04.280]   And the only problem is that...
[00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:07.960]   And it's happened on more than one occasion where I'll put it on its charger and then
[00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:09.720]   it's not connected right.
[00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:13.160]   And I come back to it and it's still only half charged or whatever.
[00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:14.720]   >> Well, that's where wireless might make sense.
[00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:18.800]   If you put the watch, you know, within a few inches of the charger, that would be sufficient.
[00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:19.800]   Okay.
[00:56:19.800 --> 00:56:23.120]   So what they don't show in that demo is how much power is coming across.
[00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:25.280]   You know, is it going to take four days to charge?
[00:56:25.280 --> 00:56:27.760]   >> How much answer is causing?
[00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:29.720]   >> How much answer is causing.
[00:56:29.720 --> 00:56:33.440]   >> Qualcomm showed me wireless charging for driverless cars.
[00:56:33.440 --> 00:56:36.720]   Admittedly, that plate is within a few inches.
[00:56:36.720 --> 00:56:38.680]   They say it's 90% efficient.
[00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:40.320]   We'll see.
[00:56:40.320 --> 00:56:46.040]   Broadcom showed me a coil and keep in mind the reason that somebody in the chat room was
[00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:51.320]   saying Tesla tried to do that years ago and failed.
[00:56:51.320 --> 00:56:56.640]   But the new wireless charging has a huge number of computers on it.
[00:56:56.640 --> 00:57:01.760]   And it's aiming at figuring out where the receivers are above the coil.
[00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:06.720]   And it's then focusing the energy on that receiver so that you can put your hand in
[00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:11.880]   between and it won't zap you or do anything negative.
[00:57:11.880 --> 00:57:14.800]   There's a lot of technology going into these and they are coming.
[00:57:14.800 --> 00:57:18.280]   You're starting to see them at Starbucks even wireless little chargers.
[00:57:18.280 --> 00:57:21.040]   But you have to have those little receivers built into your phones.
[00:57:21.040 --> 00:57:23.640]   And I don't have a phone that hasn't built in yet.
[00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:25.880]   And I don't have a watch that hasn't built in yet.
[00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:28.480]   >> In fact, most of these phones are losing wireless charging.
[00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:29.960]   The Pixel doesn't have it.
[00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:30.960]   Apple doesn't have it.
[00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:31.960]   I would love to see.
[00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:33.840]   >> It costs money to put it in, right?
[00:57:33.840 --> 00:57:35.600]   You're trying to keep the cheapest, cheapest product.
[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:37.400]   You have to decide to put that in.
[00:57:37.400 --> 00:57:38.400]   >> Let's take a break.
[00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:42.480]   We had a great week this week on Twitter and we've created a fun little promo to remind
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:45.280]   you what you're missing if you don't watch constantly watch it.
[00:57:45.280 --> 00:57:47.120]   >> Previously on Twitter.
[00:57:47.120 --> 00:57:50.920]   >> Did you guys see that Americans are eating so much bacon that reserves her to 50 year
[00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:51.920]   low?
[00:57:51.920 --> 00:57:52.920]   >> The good news.
[00:57:52.920 --> 00:57:57.040]   Rest assured, the pork industry will not run out of supply.
[00:57:57.040 --> 00:57:59.360]   For more information, there's a website.
[00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:01.400]   >> Make your sure it's.com.
[00:58:01.400 --> 00:58:03.560]   >> Triangulation.
[00:58:03.560 --> 00:58:06.760]   >> Maker City is the book of practical God for reinventing our cities.
[00:58:06.760 --> 00:58:10.880]   >> And when we say Maker City, we don't just mean manufacturing stuff in cities.
[00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:15.360]   We mean making things to solve the problem in your city, making your city.
[00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:16.720]   >> This week in law.
[00:58:16.720 --> 00:58:24.200]   >> Ben Weisner from the ACLU is here with us today is also quite well known as Edward Snowden's
[00:58:24.200 --> 00:58:25.200]   lawyer.
[00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:29.680]   >> Technology has taken some of the sting out of exile.
[00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:35.720]   It allows Edward Snowden in 2016 to do 50 public appearances by video technology.
[00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:40.200]   The government has been able to keep him out of the country, but it hasn't been able to
[00:58:40.200 --> 00:58:42.440]   keep his message or his voice out of the country.
[00:58:42.440 --> 00:58:48.480]   >> Twit, broadcasting from the capital of the free world, Petaluma, California.
[00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:49.480]   >> It's blank.
[00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:51.920]   There is no bacon shortage.com.
[00:58:51.920 --> 00:58:57.280]   >> That is really, there's so much, so many questions here.
[00:58:57.280 --> 00:59:00.960]   >> None of which will ever get answered.
[00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:03.720]   What's coming up in the week ahead, Jason Howell tells us.
[00:59:03.720 --> 00:59:04.720]   >> Hey, thanks, Leo.
[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:10.120]   Here's a look at just a few things we'll be watching in the week ahead on Tuesday, February
[00:59:10.120 --> 00:59:11.120]   7th.
[00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:15.480]   Dell is going to release its new line of education focused Chromebook laptops.
[00:59:15.480 --> 00:59:21.560]   The two in ones will feature an included stylus, full touchscreen support, and the ability
[00:59:21.560 --> 00:59:24.120]   to run Android apps right out of the box.
[00:59:24.120 --> 00:59:25.120]   Very nice.
[00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:30.200]   On Thursday, February 9th, Google is expected to unveil its big version to update for Android
[00:59:30.200 --> 00:59:31.200]   Wear.
[00:59:31.200 --> 00:59:33.640]   Of course, it's rumored at this point, but it is expected.
[00:59:33.640 --> 00:59:39.280]   Also expected to launch with the news are two new watches, both developed in partnership
[00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:41.480]   between Google and LG.
[00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:45.600]   And also on February 9th, Twitter is expected to report its earnings for the last quarter
[00:59:45.600 --> 00:59:46.600]   of 2016.
[00:59:46.600 --> 00:59:52.040]   Twitter's had a rough time gaining new users throughout the course of 2016 and has declined
[00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:55.440]   in five consecutive earnings report periods.
[00:59:55.440 --> 01:00:00.800]   As well, Twitter now faces even stiffer competition from others, including Snap, that just filed
[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:02.960]   for its own IPO, as you know, last week.
[01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:07.800]   Megamoroni and I will cover all of this and a whole lot more on Tech News today, each and
[01:00:07.800 --> 01:00:10.120]   every weekday at 4PM Pacific.
[01:00:10.120 --> 01:00:11.320]   That's a look at the week ahead.
[01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:12.320]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:00:12.320 --> 01:00:13.320]   Thank you, Jason.
[01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:18.920]   Monday through Friday, 4PM, 7PM Eastern, 2400 UTC.
[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:22.280]   So this is going to be a big week for Android.
[01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:27.520]   All about Android is going to have Evan Blass, the guy who runs the Evleaks Twitter account
[01:00:27.520 --> 01:00:28.760]   on all about Android.
[01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:31.520]   Is that this week on the 8th?
[01:00:31.520 --> 01:00:35.480]   And by the way, he was the one who leaked out the first images of that LG Android Wear
[01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:37.080]   2.0 watch.
[01:00:37.080 --> 01:00:38.080]   So that's coming out.
[01:00:38.080 --> 01:00:44.400]   I'm actually getting the Samsung Plus should come on the 13th in the next week or so.
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:48.360]   That's the Chromebook that has also a stylus and is a convertible, much like the Dell.
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:51.200]   It's going to be an interesting spring for Chromebooks.
[01:00:51.200 --> 01:00:53.360]   Our show today brought to you by Stamps.com.
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:58.280]   Why go to the post office when you can do everything you would do at the post office without
[01:00:58.280 --> 01:00:59.520]   leaving your desk?
[01:00:59.520 --> 01:01:00.920]   Stamps.com makes it possible.
[01:01:00.920 --> 01:01:06.160]   You can buy and print real US postage whenever you need it, right from your desk with your
[01:01:06.160 --> 01:01:07.160]   computer, your printer.
[01:01:07.160 --> 01:01:08.600]   It's not a postage meter.
[01:01:08.600 --> 01:01:09.680]   You don't need anything special.
[01:01:09.680 --> 01:01:11.680]   You've already got what you need.
[01:01:11.680 --> 01:01:14.840]   And the best part is, you know, you can, they've got a USB scale.
[01:01:14.840 --> 01:01:17.200]   I'll show you how you get that for free.
[01:01:17.200 --> 01:01:18.200]   You put the stuff on there.
[01:01:18.200 --> 01:01:21.120]   You always have exactly the right amount of postage.
[01:01:21.120 --> 01:01:25.920]   It'll make suggestions for different ways to mail something to save you money, like media
[01:01:25.920 --> 01:01:27.680]   mail, if it's appropriate.
[01:01:27.680 --> 01:01:31.280]   It will print out all the forms you need if you're doing certified mail or if you're
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:34.520]   doing express mail or maybe you're doing an overseas shipment.
[01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:36.000]   It'll print out the customs force.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:37.640]   In fact, not just the form.
[01:01:37.640 --> 01:01:40.520]   It'll pre-fill it with the information.
[01:01:40.520 --> 01:01:45.920]   So if you're an eBay seller, Amazon, Etsy, you've got the buyer's information, it just
[01:01:45.920 --> 01:01:50.000]   fills out the form, everything you need, you print it, you're ready to go.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:56.360]   And then a uniformed official of the US government will come and pick it up, the mailman.
[01:01:56.360 --> 01:01:58.040]   He'll come and pick it up.
[01:01:58.040 --> 01:02:02.080]   There's even a button on the Stamps.com site that says, okay, come get it.
[01:02:02.080 --> 01:02:04.440]   You literally don't have to go to the post office anymore.
[01:02:04.440 --> 01:02:06.240]   We've got a great deal if you want to try it.
[01:02:06.240 --> 01:02:09.800]   A four-week trial that includes, it's worth $110.
[01:02:09.800 --> 01:02:13.560]   That scale I mentioned, you pay the shipping and handling on that, which is $5.
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:19.160]   Maybe make that up with a $5 supply kit and $55 in free postage.
[01:02:19.160 --> 01:02:24.440]   Literally, postage coupons you can use over the first few months of your account.
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:25.440]   You got to try it.
[01:02:25.440 --> 01:02:27.000]   Go to Stamps.com before you do anything else.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.920]   Click the microphone in the upper right hand corner.
[01:02:29.920 --> 01:02:34.680]   Use the offer code TWIT, T-W-I-T that lets them know you heard it here.
[01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:40.880]   If you're still doing this the old-fashioned way, get with the program.
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:44.280]   This is the way mailing ought to be done.
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:45.600]   Stamps.com.
[01:02:45.600 --> 01:02:47.440]   Click the microphone in the right hand corner.
[01:02:47.440 --> 01:02:50.080]   Promo code TWIT for $110.
[01:02:50.080 --> 01:02:54.080]   No risk, special offer.
[01:02:54.080 --> 01:03:01.000]   Robert Scoble is here, the Scoble-Aza from UploadVR, his new book, the fourth transformation
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:05.640]   all about not just AR artificial intelligence, which I like.
[01:03:05.640 --> 01:03:07.760]   I'm very excited about that.
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:12.000]   And voice interfaces, I'm sure, included in that, Georgia data.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:18.360]   Our friend from imore.com, virtual reality expert, she can kick your ass literally because
[01:03:18.360 --> 01:03:22.160]   she is a trained martial artist and Canadian champion.
[01:03:22.160 --> 01:03:23.560]   Don't mess with you.
[01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:28.200]   I'm not going to mess with her.
[01:03:28.200 --> 01:03:31.040]   It's okay, we can fight in VR, so it doesn't matter.
[01:03:31.040 --> 01:03:32.040]   Yeah.
[01:03:32.040 --> 01:03:33.040]   It's just fun.
[01:03:33.040 --> 01:03:34.040]   Yeah.
[01:03:34.040 --> 01:03:35.920]   Can you do that yet?
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:41.600]   Could I put on my vibe you put on your vibe and you could kick my ass remotely?
[01:03:41.600 --> 01:03:42.600]   We can do that.
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:43.600]   Yeah.
[01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:44.600]   Really?
[01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:45.600]   Yeah, for sure.
[01:03:45.600 --> 01:03:46.600]   That'd be fun.
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:48.120]   It's not actually like you can't do like a martial art game yet.
[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:51.040]   Like there's some boxing games and stuff that are a little bit weak, but yeah, there's
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:52.040]   some other games.
[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:53.340]   We can play paintball and shoot it out.
[01:03:53.340 --> 01:03:55.440]   It's a lot of fun things you can do.
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:56.960]   Yeah, maybe that's what's gone wrong.
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:58.680]   I haven't really connected anybody else.
[01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:01.920]   I'm just lonely boy playing with my...
[01:04:01.920 --> 01:04:05.920]   Leo, there was a company at CES this year and I'm sorry that I don't remember their
[01:04:05.920 --> 01:04:14.260]   name, but they have sensors that you strap to your feet so you can actually do hand
[01:04:14.260 --> 01:04:21.980]   control so you could actually do like a Hadocan from Street Fighter at somebody or a roundkick
[01:04:21.980 --> 01:04:23.560]   and actually have a track.
[01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:24.880]   It looked really kind of cool.
[01:04:24.880 --> 01:04:25.880]   That's neat.
[01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:32.200]   At Sundance, I wore an entire suit with 26 sensors on it as part of one of the exhibits
[01:04:32.200 --> 01:04:33.600]   there and it was amazing.
[01:04:33.600 --> 01:04:35.120]   I don't think that's a sensor.
[01:04:35.120 --> 01:04:37.040]   It might be too much for me though.
[01:04:37.040 --> 01:04:38.040]   How am I going to?
[01:04:38.040 --> 01:04:41.120]   I don't know if I want to get fully suited up unless it looks really awesome.
[01:04:41.120 --> 01:04:43.040]   Yes, enough work as it is, isn't it?
[01:04:43.040 --> 01:04:44.040]   Yeah.
[01:04:44.040 --> 01:04:45.040]   I think gloves are coming along.
[01:04:45.040 --> 01:04:49.320]   I saw some gloves with ultrasonic speakers that touch your fingers and you could feel
[01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:50.320]   fabric.
[01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:51.320]   It was not.
[01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:52.320]   That sounds amazing.
[01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:57.180]   I just want it to be so that I can have it on like a sensor, a strap that I can strap
[01:04:57.180 --> 01:05:03.140]   to my ankles so that it can tell when I'm running or walking or kicking and then that
[01:05:03.140 --> 01:05:04.380]   would be perfect for me.
[01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:06.540]   I don't think that I would need much more besides that.
[01:05:06.540 --> 01:05:10.220]   Well, the cool thing about this thing that I'm talking about that you strap to your feet
[01:05:10.220 --> 01:05:18.220]   is that this actually transmitted a haptic response back through your feet.
[01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:23.140]   So if you wanted to simulate the sense of crushing snow or walking across gravel or
[01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:28.980]   pea-sized rocks, for example, you could do that or splashing in water.
[01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:32.500]   So there were some really cool ideas that were being introduced without them.
[01:05:32.500 --> 01:05:38.420]   I hate to bring us down to Earth, but I guess we have a few stories that relate to modern
[01:05:38.420 --> 01:05:41.020]   times, the current times.
[01:05:41.020 --> 01:05:45.420]   Google, for instance, has been a US judge, a magistrate in Philadelphia.
[01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:50.460]   Thomas Reuter has ruled that Google must hand over emails even if they're stored on a foreign
[01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:51.460]   server.
[01:05:51.460 --> 01:05:57.660]   You remember Microsoft had a similar case which they fought and one email stored in Ireland,
[01:05:57.660 --> 01:06:03.580]   a district judge said, "No, they don't have to hand that over."
[01:06:03.580 --> 01:06:10.300]   So we have two conflicting opinions here and I'm sure appeals will come in both cases.
[01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:17.540]   On the one hand, if you use Gmail or you use Microsoft's Outlook.com, I don't know if
[01:06:17.540 --> 01:06:23.300]   you have a reasonable expectation of privacy just because your data is stored on an international
[01:06:23.300 --> 01:06:25.940]   server.
[01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:30.340]   And yet it makes it difficult for companies to operate because it isn't long before every
[01:06:30.340 --> 01:06:32.980]   country says you have to have a...
[01:06:32.980 --> 01:06:34.060]   Russia's already doing this.
[01:06:34.060 --> 01:06:39.660]   Russia closed down LinkedIn, remember, in Russia because they didn't store their data
[01:06:39.660 --> 01:06:40.660]   on Russian soil.
[01:06:40.660 --> 01:06:47.980]   I think the question is not just like, "Do you, but should you?"
[01:06:47.980 --> 01:06:53.140]   Like what kind of legislation do we want to have to be able to have what is unlawful
[01:06:53.140 --> 01:06:57.740]   versus lawful search and seizure to what you have and what is privacy versus not?
[01:06:57.740 --> 01:07:01.100]   Because now everything is going to be served onto the cloud.
[01:07:01.100 --> 01:07:04.980]   And so when we make that change versus where a mail was actually stored inside of our house
[01:07:04.980 --> 01:07:09.260]   and you could not get to it versus being on our computer, where part of that is not, you
[01:07:09.260 --> 01:07:10.620]   know, tracked onto our house.
[01:07:10.620 --> 01:07:12.140]   Well, and even Google says that.
[01:07:12.140 --> 01:07:15.620]   It says sometimes in the court case, it says sometimes it breaks up email into pieces for
[01:07:15.620 --> 01:07:17.420]   network performance reasons.
[01:07:17.420 --> 01:07:19.860]   So it doesn't know where emails are stored.
[01:07:19.860 --> 01:07:21.100]   It doesn't know what country.
[01:07:21.100 --> 01:07:23.820]   I guess my point would be...
[01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:29.860]   Well, I think a normal person would say, "It's trickery to say, well, it's part of
[01:07:29.860 --> 01:07:32.820]   it's in Ireland, part of it's in Denmark."
[01:07:32.820 --> 01:07:39.260]   It's a US company and the defendant in both cases is a US citizen.
[01:07:39.260 --> 01:07:44.740]   What does it matter where the data has been routed?
[01:07:44.740 --> 01:07:47.500]   And I think most normal people would say that.
[01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:51.820]   Maybe not more wrong.
[01:07:51.820 --> 01:07:54.620]   In any event, that's one situation.
[01:07:54.620 --> 01:07:58.940]   The other down-to-earth situation has to do with the new chairman of the FCC, Ajit Pai.
[01:07:58.940 --> 01:08:05.620]   We were all a little worried when Trump made him the chairman of the FCC because he's a
[01:08:05.620 --> 01:08:06.620]   commissioner.
[01:08:06.620 --> 01:08:10.340]   He was on the commission, didn't need Senate approval for that reason, but elevated to
[01:08:10.340 --> 01:08:15.620]   the chairmanship replacing Tom Wheeler, who's been a surprisingly strong advocate for net
[01:08:15.620 --> 01:08:18.020]   neutrality and other things.
[01:08:18.020 --> 01:08:24.780]   Ajit Pai, very much against net neutrality, pro-competition.
[01:08:24.780 --> 01:08:28.900]   I guess a better way to say it from his point of view would be he's a fork competition.
[01:08:28.900 --> 01:08:32.980]   And against government regulation on the internet, we might be able to agree on that.
[01:08:32.980 --> 01:08:38.940]   But on Friday, what one commissioner called a "clean out the trash" moment, Pai made
[01:08:38.940 --> 01:08:43.180]   a bunch of rulings that threw out things that the FCC had been working on, one of which
[01:08:43.180 --> 01:08:49.860]   was a pet project of ours, was the idea to open up cable set-top boxes to competitors.
[01:08:49.860 --> 01:08:55.820]   If you're a Comcast customer, instead of having to rent a low-tech box from Comcast, you get
[01:08:55.820 --> 01:09:01.060]   something much more interesting from, say, Apple or Google or Roku.
[01:09:01.060 --> 01:09:07.420]   That move, which had been approved by Tom Wheeler, was reversed on Friday.
[01:09:07.420 --> 01:09:12.740]   Pai also announced that the FCC, in a letter to the big mobile carriers, the FCC was going
[01:09:12.740 --> 01:09:16.620]   to drop its investigation into zero rating.
[01:09:16.620 --> 01:09:21.380]   This is one, another one, where I think the average person says, "What's wrong with zero
[01:09:21.380 --> 01:09:22.380]   rating?
[01:09:22.380 --> 01:09:33.180]   And it's kind of harder to convince them that, in fact, it's detrimental to net neutrality."
[01:09:33.180 --> 01:09:37.180]   Any thoughts about either of those?
[01:09:37.180 --> 01:09:38.180]   Yes, not.
[01:09:38.180 --> 01:09:39.620]   Yes, actually I do.
[01:09:39.620 --> 01:09:40.620]   Okay, go ahead, Peter.
[01:09:40.620 --> 01:09:43.740]   I'm mad as hell about the cable box thing.
[01:09:43.740 --> 01:09:44.740]   Yeah, me too.
[01:09:44.740 --> 01:09:47.500]   I thought that was pretty, it was a no-brainer.
[01:09:47.500 --> 01:09:49.300]   Yeah, it is.
[01:09:49.300 --> 01:09:58.380]   Because the whole experience of using cable is sort of artificially screwed up by the
[01:09:58.380 --> 01:10:02.500]   fact that you have to negotiate everything through the cable company and the cable box.
[01:10:02.500 --> 01:10:07.260]   And look, I understand that they want to be the gatekeepers of revenue and that the entertainment
[01:10:07.260 --> 01:10:12.580]   companies are content to make them the gatekeepers of revenue.
[01:10:12.580 --> 01:10:16.020]   And I understand that there are going to be issues like having to authenticate different
[01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:23.820]   services and different channels and stuff like that on my Apple TV.
[01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:28.740]   But when I look at trying to use, I'm an XFINITY customer, for example.
[01:10:28.740 --> 01:10:34.020]   I'm a Comcast customer because they're literally the only game in town.
[01:10:34.020 --> 01:10:38.340]   I can't get ditched in a direct TV, but there's no competition.
[01:10:38.340 --> 01:10:42.380]   They're functionally the only broadband/cable provider.
[01:10:42.380 --> 01:10:48.860]   So I'm either stuck with X1 or GTFO, as they say.
[01:10:48.860 --> 01:10:53.420]   And I've done things like got in a Tivo and then you have to get a cable card and never,
[01:10:53.420 --> 01:10:56.300]   never really kind of gels quite right.
[01:10:56.300 --> 01:11:03.340]   Or you get an Apple TV or a Roku box or something else and you plug it in and you can use it
[01:11:03.340 --> 01:11:05.220]   in addition to what you're using with cable.
[01:11:05.220 --> 01:11:07.060]   But you can't really cut the cord.
[01:11:07.060 --> 01:11:08.940]   You can't really do that.
[01:11:08.940 --> 01:11:15.900]   And this was an opportunity for customers to kind of divest themselves of that hostage
[01:11:15.900 --> 01:11:21.020]   relationship that we've got with the cable companies that I thought was a very pro-consumer
[01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:23.460]   choice or a pro-consumer move.
[01:11:23.460 --> 01:11:31.060]   And to see them backpedal on it tells me or it affirms to me that this administration
[01:11:31.060 --> 01:11:39.500]   or at least a G-PY is more interested in corporate harmony than he is in providing anything of
[01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:44.180]   benefit to actual people who are paying for this crap.
[01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:45.180]   That's my wrap.
[01:11:45.180 --> 01:11:50.340]   Strong recommendation for the back channel interview Susan Crawford did with the outgoing
[01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:58.420]   chairman, Tom Wheeler, who has some very strong words for Adjut Pai and what he's up to.
[01:11:58.420 --> 01:12:02.740]   And I think defends the notion of internet regulation.
[01:12:02.740 --> 01:12:06.460]   I remember talking to John Perry Barlow, one of the founders of the EFF.
[01:12:06.460 --> 01:12:12.380]   He said the EFF board was really torn over this because many of them said we don't want
[01:12:12.380 --> 01:12:14.340]   any government regulation of the internet.
[01:12:14.340 --> 01:12:15.620]   That's always a bad idea.
[01:12:15.620 --> 01:12:17.420]   They're guaranteed to do it poorly.
[01:12:17.420 --> 01:12:24.340]   But many of them also saw the necessity of protecting net neutrality against companies
[01:12:24.340 --> 01:12:27.100]   that don't really have an interest in preserving net neutrality.
[01:12:27.100 --> 01:12:30.140]   But instead maximizing profit.
[01:12:30.140 --> 01:12:35.260]   Wheeler's response to this conundrum is people say the problem is government are so wrong.
[01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:39.020]   This is so surprising because we thought Wheeler was going to be terrible when he came in.
[01:12:39.020 --> 01:12:42.300]   He was a former lobbyist for the cable and the wireless industry.
[01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:44.220]   But he turned out that he kind of knew what he was talking about.
[01:12:44.220 --> 01:12:47.900]   He says because the people say the problems government are so wrong, the government is
[01:12:47.900 --> 01:12:48.900]   the people.
[01:12:48.900 --> 01:12:50.900]   It's where we come together to solve our common problems.
[01:12:50.900 --> 01:12:52.620]   It's a messy process.
[01:12:52.620 --> 01:12:54.620]   And it's a painful process.
[01:12:54.620 --> 01:12:58.900]   But if we can't work out things there, we're in a whole hell of a lot of trouble.
[01:12:58.900 --> 01:13:03.220]   He says what's going to end up happening, in fact it's already started.
[01:13:03.220 --> 01:13:09.660]   Pi is using the excuse that we're going to modernize the FCC to move much of the FCC's
[01:13:09.660 --> 01:13:14.380]   authority to the Federal Trade Commission.
[01:13:14.380 --> 01:13:16.140]   Of that, Wheeler says it's a fraud.
[01:13:16.140 --> 01:13:18.620]   The FTC doesn't have rulemaking authority.
[01:13:18.620 --> 01:13:20.660]   They've got enforcement authority.
[01:13:20.660 --> 01:13:23.220]   And their authority is whether or not something is unfair or deceptive.
[01:13:23.220 --> 01:13:24.820]   They have to worry about everything.
[01:13:24.820 --> 01:13:27.180]   Computer chips to bleach labeling.
[01:13:27.180 --> 01:13:31.900]   Of course the carriers want telecom issues to get lost in that morass.
[01:13:31.900 --> 01:13:34.380]   That was the strategy all along.
[01:13:34.380 --> 01:13:38.980]   One more action on sweep it out Friday.
[01:13:38.980 --> 01:13:42.700]   And this one, I'm not going to weigh in on one way or the other.
[01:13:42.700 --> 01:13:44.340]   It seems on the face of it a bad idea.
[01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:45.980]   They're revoking permission.
[01:13:45.980 --> 01:13:50.780]   The FCC is revoking permission from companies that have been offering lifeline broadband
[01:13:50.780 --> 01:13:51.780]   service.
[01:13:51.780 --> 01:13:56.900]   You may remember in the mid 80s, the FCC created lifeline service for telephones.
[01:13:56.900 --> 01:13:59.940]   It's a charge on our bills.
[01:13:59.940 --> 01:14:05.580]   It pays for inexpensive phone service for poor people.
[01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:10.460]   This was expanded last year by the FCC to include broadband, to subsidize broadband
[01:14:10.460 --> 01:14:12.340]   for people who couldn't afford it.
[01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:16.100]   Quite reasonably I think saying that everybody needs access these days to the internet for
[01:14:16.100 --> 01:14:21.580]   education, for information, for participation in government.
[01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:30.940]   That was reversed on Friday by Pi who eliminated nine companies from providing federally subsidized
[01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:32.500]   internet to the poor.
[01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:36.140]   So the lifeline broadband project is now dead as well.
[01:14:36.140 --> 01:14:39.940]   And that seems like a serious problem.
[01:14:39.940 --> 01:14:45.740]   Some say, well, there was rife with corruption or misrun, mismanaged.
[01:14:45.740 --> 01:14:48.540]   You're going to have to prove that to me.
[01:14:48.540 --> 01:14:54.140]   But those three things put together all on Friday seem to me that the FCC is moving very
[01:14:54.140 --> 01:14:59.740]   much in the favor of corporate interests and very much against the interests of the people.
[01:14:59.740 --> 01:15:05.580]   Which is really sad because the digital divide is a big issue for families that can afford
[01:15:05.580 --> 01:15:07.020]   because everything's on the internet.
[01:15:07.020 --> 01:15:10.020]   There's not homework that children are going to be doing or projects that are going to
[01:15:10.020 --> 01:15:13.820]   be done that you can do without having internet access.
[01:15:13.820 --> 01:15:17.820]   And that also cuts off access to information, which is a really big deal.
[01:15:17.820 --> 01:15:18.820]   Yeah.
[01:15:18.820 --> 01:15:22.260]   Well, I just have to keep watching.
[01:15:22.260 --> 01:15:30.740]   I guess voting, not just with our dollars, but with our emails, our letters, our messages.
[01:15:30.740 --> 01:15:33.380]   I think you're going to have to pick the topic that you care the most about because there's
[01:15:33.380 --> 01:15:34.580]   a lot of them.
[01:15:34.580 --> 01:15:36.060]   A lot of those.
[01:15:36.060 --> 01:15:44.180]   Speaking of zero rating and the EFF, I thought back in, I guess it was a year ago, it was
[01:15:44.180 --> 01:15:45.380]   February of last year.
[01:15:45.380 --> 01:15:50.300]   They did a look at zero rating and why they've got a problem with it.
[01:15:50.300 --> 01:15:56.140]   Not only are people clearly falling off on that end of the digital divide, people who
[01:15:56.140 --> 01:16:01.020]   are underprivileged, people who don't live in well, served markets are not able to get
[01:16:01.020 --> 01:16:05.500]   high-speed internet communication or in many cases internet communication at all because
[01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:08.860]   they don't even have a device that can connect to the internet, let alone the access to do
[01:16:08.860 --> 01:16:09.860]   it.
[01:16:09.860 --> 01:16:15.140]   But with zero rating, you've got consumers increasingly funneled towards specific types
[01:16:15.140 --> 01:16:20.220]   of content that the service providers like T-Mobile and the other companies that are doing
[01:16:20.220 --> 01:16:24.700]   zero rating have deemed to be free.
[01:16:24.700 --> 01:16:31.820]   But that all of a sudden, you're disincented from using services or products that aren't
[01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:32.820]   free.
[01:16:32.820 --> 01:16:33.820]   I know I've even run into this.
[01:16:33.820 --> 01:16:34.820]   It's a T-Mobile customer.
[01:16:34.820 --> 01:16:39.660]   It's like, "Hey, wait a minute, is this music streaming service that I'm using actually
[01:16:39.660 --> 01:16:41.700]   something that's supported by my data plan?"
[01:16:41.700 --> 01:16:42.700]   No.
[01:16:42.700 --> 01:16:47.180]   Okay, well, I don't know that I necessarily want to listen to this stuff then and waste
[01:16:47.180 --> 01:16:50.900]   my bandwidth because I've only got X gigabytes to use every month.
[01:16:50.900 --> 01:16:56.860]   So I know from my own experience, just anecdotally, that I'll police myself if I don't know
[01:16:56.860 --> 01:16:58.740]   that the data is going to be free.
[01:16:58.740 --> 01:17:04.660]   That sets up, I think, a very dangerous precedent where consumers are incented to value some
[01:17:04.660 --> 01:17:07.700]   types of data over another because you're getting them for free.
[01:17:07.700 --> 01:17:10.420]   It just does not sit well with me at all.
[01:17:10.420 --> 01:17:15.460]   It's just difficult to argue because when you say free, consumers go, "Yeah, I like free."
[01:17:15.460 --> 01:17:17.580]   So it's hard to convince them, "Well, this is a bad idea.
[01:17:17.580 --> 01:17:22.900]   This is putting T-Mobile or Verizon or AT&T in charge of which services win and which
[01:17:22.900 --> 01:17:24.660]   services lose."
[01:17:24.660 --> 01:17:26.620]   And it really impairs innovation.
[01:17:26.620 --> 01:17:27.860]   I have a dog in the sun.
[01:17:27.860 --> 01:17:34.580]   I have to confess because we're an internet-consumed product and we're not zero rated by anybody.
[01:17:34.580 --> 01:17:39.140]   And so that means you're much more likely to listen to Spotify than you are to Twit.
[01:17:39.140 --> 01:17:40.940]   That's bad for me.
[01:17:40.940 --> 01:17:44.260]   And I don't even care for me, frankly, because I think it's the next thing that's coming,
[01:17:44.260 --> 01:17:46.260]   the next Twit, whatever the next thing is.
[01:17:46.260 --> 01:17:48.220]   That's the one that's really going to hurt us.
[01:17:48.220 --> 01:17:49.220]   We lose that.
[01:17:49.220 --> 01:17:51.860]   Anyway, there you have it.
[01:17:51.860 --> 01:17:55.940]   That's the FCC Roundup for this week.
[01:17:55.940 --> 01:17:57.340]   Let's take a quick break.
[01:17:57.340 --> 01:18:01.460]   We'll talk about, oh, I don't know, something happy like ordering Starbucks from your Amazon
[01:18:01.460 --> 01:18:02.460]   Echo.
[01:18:02.460 --> 01:18:06.780]   Our show today brought to you by our internet service provider, Fighting the Good Fight,
[01:18:06.780 --> 01:18:07.780]   Sonic.com.
[01:18:07.780 --> 01:18:17.500]   You know, we have, if you ever want to experience wonderful internet access, unlimited, no cap,
[01:18:17.500 --> 01:18:24.140]   no zero rating, everything is the same, absolute net neutrality, a company that fights for
[01:18:24.140 --> 01:18:30.740]   your privacy, a company that fights government orders whenever, in every case, you would want
[01:18:30.740 --> 01:18:31.820]   to try our internet.
[01:18:31.820 --> 01:18:33.700]   Come over to the studio and use our Sonic.
[01:18:33.700 --> 01:18:38.620]   We've got, was it 10 gigabit symmetric, 10 gigabits up, 10 gigabits down.
[01:18:38.620 --> 01:18:40.980]   Now no machine we have could take care of 10.
[01:18:40.980 --> 01:18:43.780]   So all the machines which have gigabit ethernet are getting a gig both ways.
[01:18:43.780 --> 01:18:45.620]   But that's good enough.
[01:18:45.620 --> 01:18:50.140]   We should get one machine with a 10 gigabit card just to see what that would be like in
[01:18:50.140 --> 01:18:51.140]   life.
[01:18:51.140 --> 01:18:52.140]   It's awesome.
[01:18:52.140 --> 01:18:54.180]   Sonic is not available everywhere.
[01:18:54.180 --> 01:18:59.220]   I'm sorry to say, but businesses all over, and homes all over California could take advantage
[01:18:59.220 --> 01:19:05.020]   of Sonic's amazing internet infrastructure with, with, you know, let me give you it.
[01:19:05.020 --> 01:19:06.660]   Let me, this is how it could be.
[01:19:06.660 --> 01:19:11.620]   I, you know, I like talking about this because this is, this could be in your neck of the
[01:19:11.620 --> 01:19:14.140]   woods if there were true competition.
[01:19:14.140 --> 01:19:18.820]   Sonic delivers residential and business fiber to the premise, not to the curb, but into the
[01:19:18.820 --> 01:19:23.860]   place, gigabit connectivity in San Francisco, the North Bay area, the East Bay area.
[01:19:23.860 --> 01:19:24.860]   What do you get?
[01:19:24.860 --> 01:19:25.860]   All right.
[01:19:25.860 --> 01:19:29.660]   Of course you get a gigabit of internet download speeds.
[01:19:29.660 --> 01:19:31.900]   You get 15 email accounts.
[01:19:31.900 --> 01:19:33.420]   You get a gigabyte of storage.
[01:19:33.420 --> 01:19:36.020]   You get personal web hosting with a new domain.
[01:19:36.020 --> 01:19:38.140]   You get fax line service.
[01:19:38.140 --> 01:19:39.500]   You get a home phone.
[01:19:39.500 --> 01:19:44.860]   All of this you get a home phone with unlimited local and long distance calling.
[01:19:44.860 --> 01:19:47.500]   You can even switch your existing number over from your car.
[01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:48.740]   And you know how much?
[01:19:48.740 --> 01:19:51.500]   $40 a month.
[01:19:51.500 --> 01:19:54.620]   $40 a month.
[01:19:54.620 --> 01:19:56.260]   If you want TV, they can do that too.
[01:19:56.260 --> 01:19:59.460]   They bundle it with dish and save you $120 bucks in your bill.
[01:19:59.460 --> 01:20:00.660]   They stand up for your privacy.
[01:20:00.660 --> 01:20:02.460]   Just look at the EFF scorecard.
[01:20:02.460 --> 01:20:04.460]   Sonic's the best.
[01:20:04.460 --> 01:20:05.460]   Sonic.com/twit.
[01:20:05.460 --> 01:20:08.500]   Go there right now and find out if you can get Sonic in your neighborhood.
[01:20:08.500 --> 01:20:11.660]   You'll get your first month of Sonic internet and phone service for free plus bundle it
[01:20:11.660 --> 01:20:15.060]   with dish and save $120 bucks in your Sonic bill.
[01:20:15.060 --> 01:20:18.060]   I know most of you who are listening can't get this.
[01:20:18.060 --> 01:20:21.140]   I just want you to know it's possible in the United States.
[01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:25.300]   This is a profitable successful company that is doing the right thing there.
[01:20:25.300 --> 01:20:26.300]   They're customers.
[01:20:26.300 --> 01:20:27.300]   Sonic.com/twit.
[01:20:27.300 --> 01:20:31.940]   We're so glad that they gave us 10 gig of it.
[01:20:31.940 --> 01:20:32.940]   You know what's fun?
[01:20:32.940 --> 01:20:34.540]   I like to do this though.
[01:20:34.540 --> 01:20:35.620]   Go to fast.com.
[01:20:35.620 --> 01:20:37.900]   That's the Netflix bandwidth tester.
[01:20:37.900 --> 01:20:39.460]   Just to show my screen.
[01:20:39.460 --> 01:20:40.460]   Here you go.
[01:20:40.460 --> 01:20:41.460]   What are we getting now?
[01:20:41.460 --> 01:20:42.460]   Oh yeah.
[01:20:42.460 --> 01:20:45.380]   Just 120 megabits per second.
[01:20:45.380 --> 01:20:46.380]   That's all.
[01:20:46.380 --> 01:20:48.380]   I love it.
[01:20:48.380 --> 01:20:51.460]   All right.
[01:20:51.460 --> 01:20:52.860]   Moving right along.
[01:20:52.860 --> 01:20:57.780]   You can now order Starbucks from Alexa.
[01:20:57.780 --> 01:20:59.260]   But does she show up with?
[01:20:59.260 --> 01:21:01.660]   No, you still have to go to the Starbucks.
[01:21:01.660 --> 01:21:06.620]   Oh, actually we mentioned this on Wednesday and people were pissed because they said,
[01:21:06.620 --> 01:21:07.620]   yeah.
[01:21:07.620 --> 01:21:13.220]   Now, because you can order all this stuff from Starbucks, you go and get in line.
[01:21:13.220 --> 01:21:16.340]   You say, oh, there's no line, but then you're still in line because they're making coffee
[01:21:16.340 --> 01:21:18.740]   for all the people who aren't there.
[01:21:18.740 --> 01:21:19.740]   Right.
[01:21:19.740 --> 01:21:24.660]   So if I have to still get in my car, I don't know if it changes any time because when I
[01:21:24.660 --> 01:21:29.380]   go on the drive through, I'm still waiting in the line with all the cars in the drive.
[01:21:29.380 --> 01:21:31.500]   I don't think it would be any different.
[01:21:31.500 --> 01:21:32.500]   No, it's not.
[01:21:32.500 --> 01:21:33.500]   It just waits.
[01:21:33.500 --> 01:21:35.980]   It makes it worse, but it's kind of cool.
[01:21:35.980 --> 01:21:41.580]   Amazon, as long as we're talking about them, has now, they don't say how many prime members
[01:21:41.580 --> 01:21:49.820]   they are, but for the first time since 2013, they revealed a growth rate.
[01:21:49.820 --> 01:21:59.460]   But according to Jason Del Rey, who did a little kind of figuring on recode.com, he
[01:21:59.460 --> 01:22:04.700]   last year did some calculations that came up with 46 million paying prime members.
[01:22:04.700 --> 01:22:09.180]   And in Amazon's and earnings released this last past week, they said they added tens of
[01:22:09.180 --> 01:22:12.260]   millions of new prime members in 2016.
[01:22:12.260 --> 01:22:13.780]   So Jason's doing the calculation.
[01:22:13.780 --> 01:22:18.540]   He says, well, let's see if it's 20 million on top of the 46 million, at least 66 million
[01:22:18.540 --> 01:22:19.540]   prime members.
[01:22:19.540 --> 01:22:23.620]   We don't know the real number, but that is a lot of money and billions of dollars just
[01:22:23.620 --> 01:22:25.380]   from the prime subscription fee.
[01:22:25.380 --> 01:22:28.980]   Yeah, I'm curious about what their churn rate is for prime members, like how many people
[01:22:28.980 --> 01:22:32.380]   just never renew after they do you think anybody doesn't renew?
[01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:36.860]   I think everybody's I would never quit Amazon prime.
[01:22:36.860 --> 01:22:40.420]   Well, you're forced into it because you've got to have a valid credit card on file and
[01:22:40.420 --> 01:22:45.100]   you know, everybody forgets and the year comes up and gets dinged with this bill.
[01:22:45.100 --> 01:22:47.020]   But don't you get a lot of great stuff from it?
[01:22:47.020 --> 01:22:48.020]   Isn't it worth it?
[01:22:48.020 --> 01:22:52.940]   You know, some years, yeah, and some years, no, it really depends on my buying habits.
[01:22:52.940 --> 01:22:56.140]   I mean, I'm certainly happy to have it.
[01:22:56.140 --> 01:23:00.220]   It's brilliant marketing because you're basically paying them for the right to buy everything
[01:23:00.220 --> 01:23:02.700]   from them from now on.
[01:23:02.700 --> 01:23:03.700]   Right exactly.
[01:23:03.700 --> 01:23:09.700]   Certainly there are some benefits to it, but you know, one thing one thing we do know from
[01:23:09.700 --> 01:23:17.220]   their fourth quarter earnings report, they added a hundred 10,000 employees this year.
[01:23:17.220 --> 01:23:21.860]   This is the there's the here's the graph from Geekwire comparing Microsoft, which is roughly
[01:23:21.860 --> 01:23:27.260]   flat Google slight increase to Amazon's growth.
[01:23:27.260 --> 01:23:30.260]   They have 341,000 employees.
[01:23:30.260 --> 01:23:31.260]   Wow.
[01:23:31.260 --> 01:23:36.740]   Anything to say about that?
[01:23:36.740 --> 01:23:39.500]   We're just happy for them.
[01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:41.900]   A lot of that's got to be warehouse fulfillment staff.
[01:23:41.900 --> 01:23:46.460]   I don't think it's, you know, yeah, I was going to say that's kind of like Apple's employee
[01:23:46.460 --> 01:23:55.620]   figures, you know, how many of those people are working in retail stores, right?
[01:23:55.620 --> 01:23:59.780]   Have you been an Elon Musk's tunnel, Robert?
[01:23:59.780 --> 01:24:03.420]   That's that's personal.
[01:24:03.420 --> 01:24:04.420]   It's personal.
[01:24:04.420 --> 01:24:06.580]   He can't talk about that.
[01:24:06.580 --> 01:24:08.260]   I mean, he's muted.
[01:24:08.260 --> 01:24:09.260]   Hold on.
[01:24:09.260 --> 01:24:11.020]   I don't hear him.
[01:24:11.020 --> 01:24:12.420]   Where are he saying?
[01:24:12.420 --> 01:24:14.420]   Is he up?
[01:24:14.420 --> 01:24:15.420]   You must have.
[01:24:15.420 --> 01:24:16.420]   Oh, sorry.
[01:24:16.420 --> 01:24:17.420]   I did.
[01:24:17.420 --> 01:24:18.420]   Oh, good.
[01:24:18.420 --> 01:24:19.420]   Okay.
[01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:21.420]   I had the first ride in the first Tesla before Elon.
[01:24:21.420 --> 01:24:22.420]   I know.
[01:24:22.420 --> 01:24:24.420]   But no, I have to.
[01:24:24.420 --> 01:24:29.740]   I did visit Hyperloop in Dubai where they're going to build one of these.
[01:24:29.740 --> 01:24:30.740]   Hyperloop.
[01:24:30.740 --> 01:24:34.060]   So there's now two separate Hyperloop companies.
[01:24:34.060 --> 01:24:38.940]   If I remember right, there's actually several because, you know, Elon just talked about
[01:24:38.940 --> 01:24:39.940]   it.
[01:24:39.940 --> 01:24:40.940]   He didn't say he was going to do it.
[01:24:40.940 --> 01:24:45.380]   And so there's been a lot of venture capital raised on building and there've been various
[01:24:45.380 --> 01:24:46.580]   tests and so forth.
[01:24:46.580 --> 01:24:47.900]   The tunnel Elon's going to do.
[01:24:47.900 --> 01:24:52.140]   In fact, they started digging a test tunnel this week.
[01:24:52.140 --> 01:24:56.860]   So this all came because Elon tweeted, oh, this traffic is killing me.
[01:24:56.860 --> 01:25:02.780]   He drives back and forth from a SpaceX to his office at Tesla in Los Angeles.
[01:25:02.780 --> 01:25:09.500]   So over the weekend, workers built a test trench 30 feet wide, 50 feet long and 15 feet
[01:25:09.500 --> 01:25:12.900]   deep on the grounds of SpaceX.
[01:25:12.900 --> 01:25:16.380]   Musk says, we're just going to figure out what it takes to improve tunneling speed by,
[01:25:16.380 --> 01:25:20.420]   well, somewhere between 500 and 1000%.
[01:25:20.420 --> 01:25:22.420]   We have no idea what we're doing.
[01:25:22.420 --> 01:25:27.100]   He wants to take a tunnel between the two corporate headquarters.
[01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:30.780]   I don't know if he'd be the only guy who gets to drive in it.
[01:25:30.780 --> 01:25:33.420]   I think it'd be a great benefit for test owners.
[01:25:33.420 --> 01:25:36.100]   And frankly, that's you don't want gas vehicles in a tunnel.
[01:25:36.100 --> 01:25:38.700]   You would want electric vehicles in a tunnel, right?
[01:25:38.700 --> 01:25:42.580]   So you don't have to worry about emissions.
[01:25:42.580 --> 01:25:43.980]   I just like that story.
[01:25:43.980 --> 01:25:48.020]   I guess it's no weirder than Apple having augmented reality glasses and a clear phone
[01:25:48.020 --> 01:25:49.020]   this year.
[01:25:49.020 --> 01:25:53.660]   It's a bigger deal though, right?
[01:25:53.660 --> 01:25:59.100]   It's a really big undertaking to try to bore like the idea of the boring company to be
[01:25:59.100 --> 01:26:01.500]   able to bore through great amounts of land.
[01:26:01.500 --> 01:26:03.540]   It's not like you see it on video games.
[01:26:03.540 --> 01:26:06.340]   There's many different things underneath the ground.
[01:26:06.340 --> 01:26:10.220]   There's water systems and oil systems and different types of earth.
[01:26:10.220 --> 01:26:15.180]   And so like not to mention the amount of infrastructure that we already have built underground.
[01:26:15.180 --> 01:26:20.180]   And so I think that the time and effort, it's a lot more than just being able to bore through
[01:26:20.180 --> 01:26:27.900]   a lot of earth quickly, but going through the amount of how damaging it can be if you
[01:26:27.900 --> 01:26:31.980]   take a small creek that's underground and you've taken the water out of that creek, then there
[01:26:31.980 --> 01:26:36.260]   might not be support for an area that could be miles away from that area.
[01:26:36.260 --> 01:26:39.140]   So it's a huge undertaking.
[01:26:39.140 --> 01:26:41.020]   I'm happy that he's trying it out.
[01:26:41.020 --> 01:26:46.460]   I just don't know if it's going to be as easy to do as he believes it would do.
[01:26:46.460 --> 01:26:49.820]   The reason he can do all this crazy stuff is because he just doesn't believe it's real
[01:26:49.820 --> 01:26:52.060]   life that we're all just in a video game.
[01:26:52.060 --> 01:26:54.980]   And that's given him absolute permission to be nuts.
[01:26:54.980 --> 01:27:00.940]   I think that he actually really wants to try something different and see why not.
[01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:05.260]   I think that often we stop ourselves because we think of all of the reasons that we shouldn't
[01:27:05.260 --> 01:27:07.260]   do something and so we don't.
[01:27:07.260 --> 01:27:12.220]   And I think that he's more of a visionary and says, he believes in his own word and thoughts
[01:27:12.220 --> 01:27:15.060]   and says, let's see if this could be reality or not.
[01:27:15.060 --> 01:27:16.700]   And I like the idea that he tries that.
[01:27:16.700 --> 01:27:20.380]   I think that we need more people to be able to make a stand, try something.
[01:27:20.380 --> 01:27:22.220]   And if it doesn't work out, that's fine.
[01:27:22.220 --> 01:27:23.220]   That's okay.
[01:27:23.220 --> 01:27:26.860]   You learn another way not to bore through earth.
[01:27:26.860 --> 01:27:32.180]   I think that Elon Musk ever since the Mark 6 prototype of the Iron Man state was upgraded
[01:27:32.180 --> 01:27:37.220]   with a C6R generator, isn't really worried about it too much because the repulsor blast
[01:27:37.220 --> 01:27:41.820]   from his suit will blast right through solid rockets.
[01:27:41.820 --> 01:27:43.060]   It's not going to be that big a deal.
[01:27:43.060 --> 01:27:46.580]   And he's always got the rockets for targeting.
[01:27:46.580 --> 01:27:54.580]   Jarvis's control of weapons firing is pretty advanced.
[01:27:54.580 --> 01:27:55.580]   Pretty good.
[01:27:55.580 --> 01:27:56.580]   That's true.
[01:27:56.580 --> 01:27:58.060]   And where's come stories he can always head towards Mars?
[01:27:58.060 --> 01:27:59.060]   I think there is.
[01:27:59.060 --> 01:28:01.380]   I think though you said something, George, is kind of interesting.
[01:28:01.380 --> 01:28:06.860]   I think Elon shares an attribute that Steve Jobs had of not having any.
[01:28:06.860 --> 01:28:14.860]   Most of us have barriers to just kind of true creativity and just like expansive generative
[01:28:14.860 --> 01:28:15.860]   thinking.
[01:28:15.860 --> 01:28:23.260]   Steve Jobs, this is Steve Jobs from that interview that was unearthed, his vision of the world.
[01:28:23.260 --> 01:28:31.980]   And I'll never forget this quote because I think it informed why Steve could be as great
[01:28:31.980 --> 01:28:33.620]   as he is.
[01:28:33.620 --> 01:28:41.020]   When you grow up, you tend to get told that the world is the way it is and your life is
[01:28:41.020 --> 01:28:46.380]   just to live your life inside the world, try not to bash into the walls too much, try to
[01:28:46.380 --> 01:28:51.340]   have a nice family life, have fun, save a little money.
[01:28:51.340 --> 01:28:52.940]   That's a very limited life.
[01:28:52.940 --> 01:28:58.020]   Life can be much broader once you discover one simple fact and that is everything around
[01:28:58.020 --> 01:29:04.060]   you that you call life was made up by people that were no smarter than you.
[01:29:04.060 --> 01:29:05.420]   And you can change it.
[01:29:05.420 --> 01:29:07.100]   You can influence it.
[01:29:07.100 --> 01:29:10.940]   You can build your own things that other people can use.
[01:29:10.940 --> 01:29:11.940]   Everything around you.
[01:29:11.940 --> 01:29:14.380]   Once you learn that, you'll never be the same again.
[01:29:14.380 --> 01:29:20.260]   Was invented by somebody and of course Steve's being polite, no smarter than you.
[01:29:20.260 --> 01:29:24.140]   What Steve's really thinking is people who are dumber than me because Steve always thought
[01:29:24.140 --> 01:29:26.060]   he was the smartest guy in the room.
[01:29:26.060 --> 01:29:31.740]   I think that gave him permission to just let's rejigger the world.
[01:29:31.740 --> 01:29:33.300]   Right.
[01:29:33.300 --> 01:29:34.300]   Right.
[01:29:34.300 --> 01:29:35.300]   Right.
[01:29:35.300 --> 01:29:36.300]   Yeah.
[01:29:36.300 --> 01:29:41.100]   Well, I think that that kind of a strong amount of narcissism that he had kind of helped that
[01:29:41.100 --> 01:29:44.500]   that he was an only child that wasn't really given a lot of nose.
[01:29:44.500 --> 01:29:45.500]   Yeah.
[01:29:45.500 --> 01:29:48.100]   So helped him be able to say I don't have to listen to you because I'm probably right
[01:29:48.100 --> 01:29:49.100]   and you're not.
[01:29:49.100 --> 01:29:51.740]   I think that Elon Musk has a very different personality type.
[01:29:51.740 --> 01:29:55.460]   He's much more caring and actually much more sensitive to that.
[01:29:55.460 --> 01:29:59.660]   He also has a strong vision of can we do it better and if we could do it better, how
[01:29:59.660 --> 01:30:02.220]   would we do it and let's try it out.
[01:30:02.220 --> 01:30:04.940]   And luckily now he has the backing to be able to actually do that.
[01:30:04.940 --> 01:30:06.780]   But when he started out, he didn't.
[01:30:06.780 --> 01:30:09.820]   So it's a really interesting personality type to that.
[01:30:09.820 --> 01:30:14.460]   And I think that in our world now we really do, it would behoove us to kind of let go
[01:30:14.460 --> 01:30:18.700]   a little bit of our critical voice of saying why I shouldn't and say, you know, why don't
[01:30:18.700 --> 01:30:20.260]   I try?
[01:30:20.260 --> 01:30:25.420]   You know, I'm reminded of a quote from George Bernard Shaw that seems somehow.
[01:30:25.420 --> 01:30:27.420]   I'm relevant.
[01:30:27.420 --> 01:30:31.620]   He once said that the reasonable man adapts himself to the world and the unreasonable
[01:30:31.620 --> 01:30:35.900]   man persists in trying to adapt the world to himself.
[01:30:35.900 --> 01:30:39.180]   Therefore, all progress is dependent on the unreasonable man.
[01:30:39.180 --> 01:30:40.180]   Yes.
[01:30:40.180 --> 01:30:46.460]   You know, the expectation that we're just going to conform and sort of abide within society's
[01:30:46.460 --> 01:30:49.420]   restrictions, I think, is an imagination killer.
[01:30:49.420 --> 01:30:51.980]   And that's what he's talking about for sure.
[01:30:51.980 --> 01:31:00.660]   I remember when Bill Moyers was doing the interviewing Joseph Campbell, one of the quotes from that
[01:31:00.660 --> 01:31:02.380]   Joseph Campbell said, the power of messed up.
[01:31:02.380 --> 01:31:03.380]   Yeah, the power of messed up.
[01:31:03.380 --> 01:31:08.020]   Joseph Campbell said, you got to remember if you don't like the culture that you're in,
[01:31:08.020 --> 01:31:09.980]   go make one of your go make a new one.
[01:31:09.980 --> 01:31:11.900]   You can make a new one.
[01:31:11.900 --> 01:31:20.260]   So in every in all of those respects, Musk, Jobs, George Bernard Shaw, Joseph Campbell,
[01:31:20.260 --> 01:31:24.140]   the common thread, they all, you're right, we're damaged in different ways.
[01:31:24.140 --> 01:31:28.060]   But the common thread is you can change your world.
[01:31:28.060 --> 01:31:31.540]   You're not stuck with what you got.
[01:31:31.540 --> 01:31:33.460]   That's powerful, powerful stuff.
[01:31:33.460 --> 01:31:34.460]   Mm-hmm.
[01:31:34.460 --> 01:31:37.260]   So a little narcissism is not a bad thing.
[01:31:37.260 --> 01:31:38.260]   It isn't.
[01:31:38.260 --> 01:31:41.900]   And even, you know, having different things that damage you is not a bad thing.
[01:31:41.900 --> 01:31:45.700]   Most people that are really strongly driven it, they're driven because they have something
[01:31:45.700 --> 01:31:48.340]   to prove because they needed to prove that.
[01:31:48.340 --> 01:31:52.380]   And so I think that, you know, we need to stop being so complacent and get off of our
[01:31:52.380 --> 01:31:55.420]   toccuses and actually go and do some good in the world.
[01:31:55.420 --> 01:31:56.420]   I like it.
[01:31:56.420 --> 01:32:00.500]   Well, like it, like, I mean, like a lot of behaviors and a lot of pathologies, narcissism
[01:32:00.500 --> 01:32:02.460]   exists on a spectrum, right?
[01:32:02.460 --> 01:32:03.460]   Right.
[01:32:03.460 --> 01:32:05.340]   Yeah, we're learning that these days.
[01:32:05.340 --> 01:32:08.140]   I mean, I'm the last guy to say anything about narcissism.
[01:32:08.140 --> 01:32:13.780]   I sit on camera 20 hours a week thinking somebody wants to hear what I have to say.
[01:32:13.780 --> 01:32:16.660]   But a whole bunch of people want to hear what you have to say.
[01:32:16.660 --> 01:32:19.100]   So you're pretty alright at the same time.
[01:32:19.100 --> 01:32:20.100]   You see?
[01:32:20.100 --> 01:32:27.580]   I really do envy those people who can create without blocks.
[01:32:27.580 --> 01:32:29.340]   You know, we all have kind of blocks.
[01:32:29.340 --> 01:32:31.500]   Oh, you can't do that or whatever in our head.
[01:32:31.500 --> 01:32:37.660]   You can't, you know, and people like jobs and people like Elon Musk seem to have blocks.
[01:32:37.660 --> 01:32:41.740]   They just, it isn't that the whole thing about micro dosing on LSD now.
[01:32:41.740 --> 01:32:44.940]   People are micro dosing on LSD to help remove those blocks.
[01:32:44.940 --> 01:32:45.940]   Does that work?
[01:32:45.940 --> 01:32:46.940]   It does.
[01:32:46.940 --> 01:32:51.220]   I'm going to talk to the guy in the tie dye shirt here.
[01:32:51.220 --> 01:32:52.220]   What?
[01:32:52.220 --> 01:32:55.020]   No, I think that's a lot of the key.
[01:32:55.020 --> 01:32:57.020]   I truly believe that different.
[01:32:57.020 --> 01:33:01.380]   The world micro dosing means a whole nether thing because there's a game called micro
[01:33:01.380 --> 01:33:02.380]   dosing.
[01:33:02.380 --> 01:33:03.380]   Really?
[01:33:03.380 --> 01:33:07.220]   You spray psychedelic stuff into the air while, you know, listen, you're going to see a lot
[01:33:07.220 --> 01:33:08.780]   of a lot of that.
[01:33:08.780 --> 01:33:15.020]   Versus LCD, which, and the actual thing, which we believe that forms connections in parts
[01:33:15.020 --> 01:33:17.620]   of our brains that are not usually connected.
[01:33:17.620 --> 01:33:21.540]   And I think that there's a lot of different medications that could actually do a lot of
[01:33:21.540 --> 01:33:22.540]   good.
[01:33:22.540 --> 01:33:28.780]   Steve always said that he's very glad he took acid LSD and that a lot of people who in the
[01:33:28.780 --> 01:33:30.660]   industry should have taken more.
[01:33:30.660 --> 01:33:32.620]   He felt bad for people who hadn't.
[01:33:32.620 --> 01:33:37.620]   And now I'm in the same generation as jobs and in our generation that was not uncommon
[01:33:37.620 --> 01:33:42.780]   to take psychedelics, whether it was LSD or psilocybin or meskone.
[01:33:42.780 --> 01:33:45.860]   And I think that our generation was an interesting generation.
[01:33:45.860 --> 01:33:54.620]   I mean, the tech world was created by people of that yolk.
[01:33:54.620 --> 01:33:55.620]   Dirty hippies.
[01:33:55.620 --> 01:33:56.620]   Dirty hippies.
[01:33:56.620 --> 01:33:57.620]   That's me.
[01:33:57.620 --> 01:33:59.660]   I'm proud to say it.
[01:33:59.660 --> 01:34:02.460]   What is micro dosing, Robert?
[01:34:02.460 --> 01:34:08.380]   Instead of using a full tab of LSD, you use a fraction of that.
[01:34:08.380 --> 01:34:10.300]   Do you trip?
[01:34:10.300 --> 01:34:16.620]   You get less of the tripping and it gives you some of the benefits of making new neural
[01:34:16.620 --> 01:34:20.420]   pathways that you get with psychedelics.
[01:34:20.420 --> 01:34:23.900]   I don't think I'm going to mess with that.
[01:34:23.900 --> 01:34:28.540]   My neural pathways are pretty well set by now.
[01:34:28.540 --> 01:34:29.540]   It was leaked.
[01:34:29.540 --> 01:34:37.580]   We've been talking about Windows 10 creators update, but also the new Windows 10 cloud.
[01:34:37.580 --> 01:34:40.620]   Everybody saw a SKU in some of the Microsoft code.
[01:34:40.620 --> 01:34:46.740]   And now an actual ISO has been leaked.
[01:34:46.740 --> 01:34:51.740]   And actually this is an interesting story for Robert, the VR heavy Windows 10 creators
[01:34:51.740 --> 01:34:52.740]   update.
[01:34:52.740 --> 01:34:58.820]   But also this new cloud version of Windows designed to compete against Chromebooks looks
[01:34:58.820 --> 01:35:00.100]   to be a reality.
[01:35:00.100 --> 01:35:02.420]   This ISO, you can't install it.
[01:35:02.420 --> 01:35:03.420]   It leaked out.
[01:35:03.420 --> 01:35:05.060]   It's not a release by Microsoft.
[01:35:05.060 --> 01:35:10.620]   It does require that you purchase all your apps from the Windows Store.
[01:35:10.620 --> 01:35:17.180]   And it's expected to be shipping on less expensive computers, laptops mostly for education.
[01:35:17.180 --> 01:35:19.340]   Yeah, there it is.
[01:35:19.340 --> 01:35:23.380]   It's Windows 10 minus the wide open app ecosystem.
[01:35:23.380 --> 01:35:25.460]   You have to buy everything from the store.
[01:35:25.460 --> 01:35:29.220]   And then I guess this goes with HoloLens a little bit.
[01:35:29.220 --> 01:35:35.300]   But the next version of Windows which comes out in the next couple of months, this spring
[01:35:35.300 --> 01:35:39.300]   is going to have a considerable amount of VR in it.
[01:35:39.300 --> 01:35:43.260]   They have the holographic interface.
[01:35:43.260 --> 01:35:45.700]   Have you been playing with that a little bit, Robert?
[01:35:45.700 --> 01:35:46.700]   Not much.
[01:35:46.700 --> 01:35:51.940]   I've been spending more time in the bib in the Oculus because that's where the bleeding
[01:35:51.940 --> 01:35:52.940]   edge is.
[01:35:52.940 --> 01:35:58.780]   Let's talk about Oculus because Oculus just got a blow in their case against ZeniMax.
[01:35:58.780 --> 01:36:06.460]   Oculus decided we'll have to pay half a billion dollars to ZeniMax.
[01:36:06.460 --> 01:36:09.980]   ZeniMax owns id software.
[01:36:09.980 --> 01:36:12.820]   That's of course the company that created Doom and Quake.
[01:36:12.820 --> 01:36:19.300]   And John Carmack, who was one of the programmers there, left.
[01:36:19.300 --> 01:36:20.460]   He saw the story goes.
[01:36:20.460 --> 01:36:23.220]   He saw an early demo of Oculus got so excited about it.
[01:36:23.220 --> 01:36:25.780]   He left id and went to Oculus.
[01:36:25.780 --> 01:36:33.460]   And he's been accused of bringing with him trade secrets, reusing code, destroying evidence.
[01:36:33.460 --> 01:36:36.260]   Problem is of course this is a jury trial in Dallas.
[01:36:36.260 --> 01:36:41.420]   And I don't know how well the jury understood what it was seeing.
[01:36:41.420 --> 01:36:45.860]   But at any event, they eventually found Oculus liable for some instances of copyright infringement
[01:36:45.860 --> 01:36:47.860]   and NDA violation.
[01:36:47.860 --> 01:36:52.060]   But they rejected the larger claim that Oculus had stolen trade secrets.
[01:36:52.060 --> 01:36:57.700]   Nevertheless, $500 million civil verdict, which will of course be appealed.
[01:36:57.700 --> 01:37:00.580]   Is this damaging to Oculus, to its reputation?
[01:37:00.580 --> 01:37:06.180]   Or I know it's because it's owned by Facebook, they could probably afford the fine.
[01:37:06.180 --> 01:37:12.500]   You know, I've met people on both sides that when I worked at Microsoft who lost suits and
[01:37:12.500 --> 01:37:17.820]   stuff, I think this comes out in the wash at the end of the day.
[01:37:17.820 --> 01:37:22.020]   But it shows that Carmack doesn't understand the law.
[01:37:22.020 --> 01:37:29.140]   He very clearly admitted taking stuff out of a company and that's not legal.
[01:37:29.140 --> 01:37:34.460]   And the first thing you do when I mean I've left Microsoft and NEC and Fast Company and
[01:37:34.460 --> 01:37:38.820]   Rackspace and at each one, they have you sign a contract that you're not allowed to take
[01:37:38.820 --> 01:37:41.100]   anything from your workplace.
[01:37:41.100 --> 01:37:43.700]   And he admitted it on stand.
[01:37:43.700 --> 01:37:48.740]   So that's why he got whacked.
[01:37:48.740 --> 01:37:58.620]   I can't say not to tell the truth, but when you break the law, you're going to see consequences
[01:37:58.620 --> 01:38:02.140]   when there's so many billions of dollars involved.
[01:38:02.140 --> 01:38:03.140]   Take a break.
[01:38:03.140 --> 01:38:07.300]   We'll get to a few final thoughts so we can all go watch some football game, I guess it's
[01:38:07.300 --> 01:38:08.540]   going on.
[01:38:08.540 --> 01:38:13.380]   Our show today brought to you by My Sheets.
[01:38:13.380 --> 01:38:17.660]   We have, it's funny, we have advertisers for My Mattress and My Sheets.
[01:38:17.660 --> 01:38:19.420]   I know that's odd, isn't it?
[01:38:19.420 --> 01:38:20.660]   But I love these sheets.
[01:38:20.660 --> 01:38:22.460]   These are from Bolin Branch.
[01:38:22.460 --> 01:38:28.260]   They are beautiful 100% organic cotton sheets that they start out super soft.
[01:38:28.260 --> 01:38:30.700]   They get softer over time.
[01:38:30.700 --> 01:38:32.820]   Bolin Branch is a great company.
[01:38:32.820 --> 01:38:37.260]   They use only sustainable and responsible methods of sourcing and manufacturing.
[01:38:37.260 --> 01:38:40.220]   And because you're buying it directly from them, you're eliminating the department store
[01:38:40.220 --> 01:38:42.940]   markup, which is massive.
[01:38:42.940 --> 01:38:46.780]   Great sheets like these, a thousand dollars in the department store.
[01:38:46.780 --> 01:38:49.860]   Only a couple of hundred bucks when you buy it directly from Bolin Branch.
[01:38:49.860 --> 01:38:53.300]   And they donate a portion of every sale to help fight human trafficking.
[01:38:53.300 --> 01:38:54.300]   They're very conscientious.
[01:38:54.300 --> 01:38:55.820]   I really like it.
[01:38:55.820 --> 01:38:58.940]   Thousands of five star reviews they've been written about in the Wall Street Journal and
[01:38:58.940 --> 01:39:05.020]   Forbes Fast Company, even three US presidents sleep on Bolin Branch Sheets.
[01:39:05.020 --> 01:39:06.020]   You could try them right now.
[01:39:06.020 --> 01:39:08.020]   Risk free for 30 nights.
[01:39:08.020 --> 01:39:10.860]   If you don't love them, send them back for a full refund, but you're not going to want
[01:39:10.860 --> 01:39:11.860]   to send them back.
[01:39:11.860 --> 01:39:16.620]   In fact, I should warn you, you're probably just going to end up buying more.
[01:39:16.620 --> 01:39:20.220]   By the way, the packaging, I don't know if we have a picture on the website.
[01:39:20.220 --> 01:39:22.300]   They come in these beautiful boxes with satin ribbons.
[01:39:22.300 --> 01:39:25.500]   If you were giving these as wedding gifts, you wouldn't have to wrap them.
[01:39:25.500 --> 01:39:27.220]   When I got mine, I thought, what is this?
[01:39:27.220 --> 01:39:29.860]   Then I opened it up and sold it to the sheets.
[01:39:29.860 --> 01:39:30.860]   They're so nice.
[01:39:30.860 --> 01:39:31.820]   They're so comfortable.
[01:39:31.820 --> 01:39:34.500]   You deserve great sheets.
[01:39:34.500 --> 01:39:37.020]   And now you don't have to be a millionaire to buy them.
[01:39:37.020 --> 01:39:40.740]   In fact, we're going to save you an additional 50 bucks off your first set of sheets.
[01:39:40.740 --> 01:39:48.580]   If you go to B-O-L-L-Ball, like Cotton Bowl, Bowl and Branch, B-R-A-N-C-H today, use the
[01:39:48.580 --> 01:39:54.380]   promo code TWIT and you'll save $50 off your first set of sheets.
[01:39:54.380 --> 01:39:55.380]   Won't be your last.
[01:39:55.380 --> 01:39:58.180]   I promise you, love our Bolin Branch Sheets.
[01:39:58.180 --> 01:39:59.820]   Bolin Branch.com promo code TWIT.
[01:39:59.820 --> 01:40:03.740]   We thank them so much for their support of this week of Tech and giving me a good night's
[01:40:03.740 --> 01:40:05.380]   sleep.
[01:40:05.380 --> 01:40:10.700]   Every night I love going to bed again and then feeling those sheets is so nice.
[01:40:10.700 --> 01:40:11.700]   So nice.
[01:40:11.700 --> 01:40:18.900]   Snap has announced where I guess they filed and now we're seeing leaked stories for their
[01:40:18.900 --> 01:40:27.380]   IPO and the speculation is they'll try to raise as much as $3 billion.
[01:40:27.380 --> 01:40:34.420]   Some interesting stuff though, if you read the filing, Snap paid out $58 million to media
[01:40:34.420 --> 01:40:36.660]   companies last year.
[01:40:36.660 --> 01:40:43.180]   They have a multi-year contract with Google for storage for cloud services, $400 million
[01:40:43.180 --> 01:40:45.300]   a year for five years minimum.
[01:40:45.300 --> 01:40:50.260]   That's a $2 billion commitment to use Google Cloud.
[01:40:50.260 --> 01:40:55.740]   We did know that Snap's user base, Snapchat user base was not growing as fast last quarter,
[01:40:55.740 --> 01:41:01.140]   Instagram taking a dent, but they did add 50 million new users last year, but only 5 million
[01:41:01.140 --> 01:41:03.060]   in the fourth quarter.
[01:41:03.060 --> 01:41:08.100]   We also found out that one of the founders of Snap, who was forced out a few years ago
[01:41:08.100 --> 01:41:12.700]   and sued, got a $158 million payout.
[01:41:12.700 --> 01:41:17.420]   He's not going to be in the money when Snap goes public and it's likely that the two
[01:41:17.420 --> 01:41:25.460]   Snap founders will become instant billionaires with this IPO.
[01:41:25.460 --> 01:41:26.980]   I love reading these.
[01:41:26.980 --> 01:41:31.900]   I don't read them, but I love reading about people who have read these filings because
[01:41:31.900 --> 01:41:34.700]   it's really interesting to see what Snap chats up to.
[01:41:34.700 --> 01:41:43.380]   Robert, are they, do you think, if you invest in Snap in their IPO, are you buying into
[01:41:43.380 --> 01:41:45.460]   this augmented reality future?
[01:41:45.460 --> 01:41:46.460]   Yeah.
[01:41:46.460 --> 01:41:48.660]   There are going to be players in this.
[01:41:48.660 --> 01:41:50.100]   Is that why there's such high flyers?
[01:41:50.100 --> 01:41:51.500]   Because right now it's just Snap.
[01:41:51.500 --> 01:41:53.300]   It's just a nap.
[01:41:53.300 --> 01:41:58.580]   I think it's a high flyer because they have so many of the younger people, people under
[01:41:58.580 --> 01:42:04.300]   25 on the service and those people monetize at a higher rate than others.
[01:42:04.300 --> 01:42:06.780]   They're more influential on culture.
[01:42:06.780 --> 01:42:14.180]   It's seen as how Facebook started out, which is true.
[01:42:14.180 --> 01:42:19.980]   They started out with college kids and then moved up throughout society.
[01:42:19.980 --> 01:42:24.980]   The hope is Snap does the same thing.
[01:42:24.980 --> 01:42:29.420]   They certainly know how to monetize with the filters, with the discover.
[01:42:29.420 --> 01:42:36.780]   Do people pay SnapChat to be on that discover page like brands?
[01:42:36.780 --> 01:42:38.620]   There's revenue sharing going on.
[01:42:38.620 --> 01:42:40.180]   There's ads and then they...
[01:42:40.180 --> 01:42:41.180]   Okay.
[01:42:41.180 --> 01:42:42.180]   Yeah.
[01:42:42.180 --> 01:42:43.180]   They share the ad revenue.
[01:42:43.180 --> 01:42:44.180]   So there's...
[01:42:44.180 --> 01:42:45.180]   I've got my Snap technicals better.
[01:42:45.180 --> 01:42:46.180]   What?
[01:42:46.180 --> 01:42:47.180]   Oh, no.
[01:42:47.180 --> 01:42:49.420]   How'd that happen?
[01:42:49.420 --> 01:42:50.980]   I stepped on them.
[01:42:50.980 --> 01:42:51.980]   I still have...
[01:42:51.980 --> 01:42:52.980]   I still have mine.
[01:42:52.980 --> 01:42:53.980]   I bought mine on eBay.
[01:42:53.980 --> 01:42:57.420]   He went to eBay and paid a premium to get those.
[01:42:57.420 --> 01:42:58.420]   Yeah.
[01:42:58.420 --> 01:43:02.100]   Well, my son got these for me in New York.
[01:43:02.100 --> 01:43:05.420]   It's fixable with the superglue, but I just haven't fixed it.
[01:43:05.420 --> 01:43:07.620]   And I sort of like being able to get back on.
[01:43:07.620 --> 01:43:12.180]   You should probably use two-part epoxy instead of superglue.
[01:43:12.180 --> 01:43:13.180]   Okay.
[01:43:13.180 --> 01:43:14.180]   There you go.
[01:43:14.180 --> 01:43:15.180]   You heard of your first...
[01:43:15.180 --> 01:43:18.980]   So not only do you know how to kickbox, but you know how to fix it too.
[01:43:18.980 --> 01:43:19.980]   He's amazing.
[01:43:19.980 --> 01:43:22.740]   I just make stuff all the time.
[01:43:22.740 --> 01:43:23.740]   He's amazing.
[01:43:23.740 --> 01:43:25.540]   I just break everything.
[01:43:25.540 --> 01:43:29.060]   That's how I know how to glue stuff back together.
[01:43:29.060 --> 01:43:31.100]   Have I hit every...
[01:43:31.100 --> 01:43:33.660]   Oh, I've been playing a little bit with Dropbox's paper.
[01:43:33.660 --> 01:43:35.460]   I think that's pretty intriguing.
[01:43:35.460 --> 01:43:40.340]   Dropbox coming out of beta with basically a Google Docs competitor.
[01:43:40.340 --> 01:43:41.340]   It's pretty nice.
[01:43:41.340 --> 01:43:43.060]   It looks a lot better than Google Docs.
[01:43:43.060 --> 01:43:45.340]   There's very pretty lots of templates.
[01:43:45.340 --> 01:43:49.180]   And if you're a Dropbox customer, you probably should try it out.
[01:43:49.180 --> 01:43:52.260]   It's cloud-based documents.
[01:43:52.260 --> 01:43:56.140]   I can't remember if this is an acquisition or something they developed inside of Dropbox.
[01:43:56.140 --> 01:43:58.540]   I feel like it might be something they acquired.
[01:43:58.540 --> 01:44:03.940]   I'm so excited by the way, Leo, to have yet another cloud-based document service.
[01:44:03.940 --> 01:44:07.420]   Yeah, I was going to ask what's the privacy...
[01:44:07.420 --> 01:44:08.420]   Oh, who cares?
[01:44:08.420 --> 01:44:09.420]   I care.
[01:44:09.420 --> 01:44:10.420]   I actually...
[01:44:10.420 --> 01:44:11.420]   I can't...
[01:44:11.420 --> 01:44:12.420]   I'm a therapist.
[01:44:12.420 --> 01:44:13.420]   Oh, that's right.
[01:44:13.420 --> 01:44:18.980]   I have to make sure that there's five sending documents that there's a certain amount of
[01:44:18.980 --> 01:44:22.940]   safety and when I... because I send out a lot of documents.
[01:44:22.940 --> 01:44:27.820]   And you couldn't use this, for instance, for notes because we know Dropbox employees could
[01:44:27.820 --> 01:44:29.820]   read them if they haven't.
[01:44:29.820 --> 01:44:30.820]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:44:30.820 --> 01:44:32.980]   So I need to know...
[01:44:32.980 --> 01:44:36.620]   If there was two-part encryption and there was something but right now, there's a huge
[01:44:36.620 --> 01:44:41.820]   gray area for anyone in the medical field of how are you going to be able to send medical
[01:44:41.820 --> 01:44:46.660]   files to doctors instead of having it through a fax machine, which again, everything has
[01:44:46.660 --> 01:44:48.460]   its own faults.
[01:44:48.460 --> 01:44:51.540]   I think we can wrap this up.
[01:44:51.540 --> 01:44:54.700]   I think we've covered every possible angle.
[01:44:54.700 --> 01:44:55.700]   Anything else, Robert?
[01:44:55.700 --> 01:44:58.660]   Anything else I should be looking for in the future?
[01:44:58.660 --> 01:45:03.620]   We could have a whole show on self-driving cars or drones that could fly around.
[01:45:03.620 --> 01:45:04.620]   We could fly around.
[01:45:04.620 --> 01:45:05.620]   Love that.
[01:45:05.620 --> 01:45:06.620]   Drones.
[01:45:06.620 --> 01:45:07.620]   I love drones.
[01:45:07.620 --> 01:45:08.620]   I love Roberts.
[01:45:08.620 --> 01:45:09.620]   I want to live in Roberts' future.
[01:45:09.620 --> 01:45:10.620]   Yeah.
[01:45:10.620 --> 01:45:12.540]   I don't think it'll be my future somehow.
[01:45:12.540 --> 01:45:13.540]   I think I'm going to...
[01:45:13.540 --> 01:45:14.540]   Are you...
[01:45:14.540 --> 01:45:16.260]   Are you going to skip you?
[01:45:16.260 --> 01:45:17.260]   It's going to skip me.
[01:45:17.260 --> 01:45:20.620]   There's a lot of airports if you want to keep up with me because I'm going to Seattle this
[01:45:20.620 --> 01:45:24.100]   week to meet with a bunch of VR companies up there.
[01:45:24.100 --> 01:45:28.860]   Then I go to Los Angeles for a conference about streaming.
[01:45:28.860 --> 01:45:32.100]   Then I go to Barcelona for Mobile World Congress.
[01:45:32.100 --> 01:45:35.940]   Then I go to Ireland to speak at a gig.
[01:45:35.940 --> 01:45:36.940]   Then I go to South by Southwest.
[01:45:36.940 --> 01:45:38.620]   I'm not going to be home very much.
[01:45:38.620 --> 01:45:39.620]   Jeez.
[01:45:39.620 --> 01:45:41.820]   Where is the best place to follow you?
[01:45:41.820 --> 01:45:42.820]   Facebook.
[01:45:42.820 --> 01:45:43.820]   Okay.
[01:45:43.820 --> 01:45:45.580]   That's where I put everything.
[01:45:45.580 --> 01:45:47.660]   That's Globalizer.com, of course, his website.
[01:45:47.660 --> 01:45:53.980]   The new book with Shell Israel, The Fourth Transformation is available now on Amazon.
[01:45:53.980 --> 01:45:58.620]   How augmented reality and artificial intelligence change everything.
[01:45:58.620 --> 01:45:59.620]   Wow.
[01:45:59.620 --> 01:46:01.260]   Nice to have you.
[01:46:01.260 --> 01:46:02.260]   Thanks for stopping by, Robert.
[01:46:02.260 --> 01:46:03.260]   I appreciate it.
[01:46:03.260 --> 01:46:04.260]   Thanks.
[01:46:04.260 --> 01:46:07.260]   Peter Cohen is editorial director at Backblaze.com.
[01:46:07.260 --> 01:46:10.420]   It's at the best place to go to read your stuff.
[01:46:10.420 --> 01:46:12.700]   And of course, I'm more in other places too, right?
[01:46:12.700 --> 01:46:13.700]   Yeah.
[01:46:13.700 --> 01:46:16.660]   Join me on Twitter at Flarg, F-L-A-R-G-H.
[01:46:16.660 --> 01:46:22.500]   I probably spend more time on Twitter than I have any reasonable reason to.
[01:46:22.500 --> 01:46:25.660]   Also my own website at Peter-Cohen.com.
[01:46:25.660 --> 01:46:27.060]   Peter Dash, Cohen.com.
[01:46:27.060 --> 01:46:29.020]   Thank you for being here, Peter.
[01:46:29.020 --> 01:46:30.580]   I appreciate it.
[01:46:30.580 --> 01:46:31.580]   Thank you as always, Leo.
[01:46:31.580 --> 01:46:33.260]   It was great to see you guys.
[01:46:33.260 --> 01:46:34.260]   Yeah.
[01:46:34.260 --> 01:46:39.700]   George Dow is a psychotherapist as well as a great writer at imore.com.
[01:46:39.700 --> 01:46:46.180]   And I want to point you to anxiety-videos.com where they have a lot of great videos in all
[01:46:46.180 --> 01:46:54.500]   sorts of wonderful areas, including how to sleep better, anxiety, parenting, breathing.
[01:46:54.500 --> 01:46:56.140]   And this can't be right.
[01:46:56.140 --> 01:46:57.140]   $5 per video.
[01:46:57.140 --> 01:46:58.140]   That's a great deal.
[01:46:58.140 --> 01:47:00.460]   There's some little short clips.
[01:47:00.460 --> 01:47:05.100]   If you want to just learn how to do passive relaxation or if you're dealing with boundaries
[01:47:05.100 --> 01:47:09.220]   and consequences and you're not dealing with one and you just want a little quip to that,
[01:47:09.220 --> 01:47:12.820]   then you can just get a little tiny snippet of it and if you are dealing with the larger
[01:47:12.820 --> 01:47:15.860]   issue, you can get a full video.
[01:47:15.860 --> 01:47:21.100]   Georgia does those with her partner Sandra Reich, clinical director at the Montreal Center
[01:47:21.100 --> 01:47:23.540]   for Anxiety and Depression.
[01:47:23.540 --> 01:47:25.820]   It's great to have you, Georgia.
[01:47:25.820 --> 01:47:26.820]   Thank you for being here.
[01:47:26.820 --> 01:47:27.820]   Thank you so much.
[01:47:27.820 --> 01:47:28.820]   Thank you all for joining us.
[01:47:28.820 --> 01:47:29.820]   We do twit normally.
[01:47:29.820 --> 01:47:33.340]   We did a little early to get out in time for the Super Bowl.
[01:47:33.340 --> 01:47:34.540]   Or at least the second half.
[01:47:34.540 --> 01:47:36.740]   I want to see those commercials.
[01:47:36.740 --> 01:47:39.940]   But normally we do it 3PM Pacific, 4PM Eastern time.
[01:47:39.940 --> 01:47:43.300]   2300 UTC if you want to stop by and join us.
[01:47:43.300 --> 01:47:45.140]   You can also visit us in studio.
[01:47:45.140 --> 01:47:46.140]   Email tickets@twit.tv.
[01:47:46.140 --> 01:47:48.020]   We're glad to put a seat out for you.
[01:47:48.020 --> 01:47:52.500]   And if you can't watch live, and by the way we are now on YouTube live at youtube.com/twit.
[01:47:52.500 --> 01:47:57.740]   You can see the live stream there and then download or watch any of the other shows there.
[01:47:57.740 --> 01:48:01.820]   You can also subscribe at our website, twit.tv.
[01:48:01.820 --> 01:48:03.220]   Or wherever you get your podcast.
[01:48:03.220 --> 01:48:06.220]   Don't forget we're still running that survey just a couple of minutes to get to know a little
[01:48:06.220 --> 01:48:07.540]   bit more about you.
[01:48:07.540 --> 01:48:08.780]   Help us sell advertising.
[01:48:08.780 --> 01:48:12.060]   Help us tune our content towards your interests.
[01:48:12.060 --> 01:48:15.140]   That's online at twit.tv/survey.
[01:48:15.140 --> 01:48:18.380]   We do not keep track of your email address.
[01:48:18.380 --> 01:48:19.380]   No salesmen will call.
[01:48:19.380 --> 01:48:22.940]   We're just trying to get a better idea of who you all are.
[01:48:22.940 --> 01:48:25.860]   Twit.tv/survey.
[01:48:25.860 --> 01:48:27.260]   Thanks everybody.
[01:48:27.260 --> 01:48:28.260]   Have a great week.
[01:48:28.260 --> 01:48:29.260]   We'll see you next time.
[01:48:29.260 --> 01:48:31.260]   Another twit is in the can.
[01:48:31.260 --> 01:48:32.260]   Bye bye.
[01:48:32.260 --> 01:48:39.260]   Bye.
