[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.080]   I'm David Ruhardwar, Senior Editor in Gadget.
[00:00:03.080 --> 00:00:07.880]   Coming up on Twit this week is a panel with Brianna Wu, Patrick Norton, and Norm Chan.
[00:00:07.880 --> 00:00:13.240]   We'll be chatting about the James Webb Space Telescope, Apple's MacBook Air M2, and the
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.000]   Uber files coming up next on the show.

[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:56.240]   It's time for Twit, this week in tech.
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:58.520]   I'm senior editor of Engadget's Winter Hard War.
[00:01:58.520 --> 00:01:59.520]   I'm not Leo Laport.
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:02.320]   He is off on a boat this week on the Twit Cruise.
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:05.160]   So hopefully he's having fun and avoiding foodborne illnesses.
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:08.520]   I feel like Cruise are really, really tough these days.
[00:02:08.520 --> 00:02:13.160]   But we have a great panel to chat about this week's tech news, including Brianna Wu, executive
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:15.240]   director of Rebellion Pack, a progressive pack.
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:16.240]   Hey Brianna.
[00:02:16.240 --> 00:02:17.240]   What's crackalackin'?
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.320]   Happy to be back.
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:21.360]   I love the word crackalackin'.
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.880]   And we've got Patrick Norton, host of AV Excel.
[00:02:23.880 --> 00:02:24.880]   Hello Patrick.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:27.880]   Hey, pleasure to be here.
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:30.480]   And we've got Norm Chan, co-founder of Tested.com.
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:35.360]   Norm, you're one of the hardest working people I know in tech, so I'm happy you could join
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.360]   us.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:38.680]   Oh, thank you so much for having me.
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:40.280]   We've got a ton of news this week.
[00:02:40.280 --> 00:02:44.560]   I don't know what was going on in the tech world, but things like, things just started
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:47.600]   piling up and Apple had a bunch of news.
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.640]   But I wanted to start with the biggest thing and probably the biggest news for all of humanity,
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:58.000]   which is the first round of pictures from the James Webb Space Telescope.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.560]   And I assume you guys have seen these things.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:04.240]   And by this point, by the time you're listening to Twit, you've probably heard it explored
[00:03:04.240 --> 00:03:05.240]   all over the place.
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.080]   But I did want to take a chance to take some time to hear what you guys thought about this
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.280]   first set of images.
[00:03:11.280 --> 00:03:16.280]   I'm a space nerd.
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.960]   I would go to the library and check out every single massive space photography book.
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:21.520]   And there are pretty much all Hubble images.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:23.680]   I guess I'm a Hubble kit.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.200]   But it just kind of got me back in that place of thinking of my place in the universe while
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:29.680]   watching these things.
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:34.240]   What did you guys think of what we've seen from James Webb so far?
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:40.280]   I don't want to start with skepticism, but I always feel so bad.
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.280]   Get this is a space, Brianna.
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:44.280]   I don't know if you can exist.
[00:03:44.280 --> 00:03:49.280]   I trust NASA because you see what they release to the public and it's always so photoshopped
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.120]   and they do post processing on it to like enhance the saturation and all of that.
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:03:58.200]   And don't get me wrong, everything they released is beautiful.
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.200]   It's awesome.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:04.440]   We're talking Star Trek motion picture vibes of like the whole universe out there.
[00:04:04.440 --> 00:04:08.760]   But there's always like a small part of my brain that's going, okay, but what degree
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.280]   of this is like artists interpretation.
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.280]   Is that too cynical?
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:13.760]   Am I being too cynical?
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.160]   No, I think there's probably a good thing we're noting too because when I was a kid,
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:21.400]   I did not realize like how much processing even went into some of those Hubble images
[00:04:21.400 --> 00:04:22.400]   as well, right?
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.240]   But that is worth noting.
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:28.120]   There's a lot of data we've gotten here as well.
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:31.640]   There was what some spectrum data from an exoplanet.
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:36.760]   I don't have the specifics in front of me, but we learned that it has the first of all,
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:39.240]   we kind of knew it already had water, but it has clouds.
[00:04:39.240 --> 00:04:41.920]   And that was kind of an interesting thing for astronomers to hear.
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.320]   So yeah, clouds on exoplanet.
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.520]   So we are going to learn so many things.
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:52.680]   Patrick Norm, did these space images blow your minds?
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:04:56.120]   Oh my goodness.
[00:04:56.120 --> 00:05:01.720]   If you scroll down on the New York Times article that this links is linked off of, keep going.
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:07.560]   And just search NASA James Webb because all the images are super easy to find.
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:13.840]   And that's the one where they kind of show, I get where Brianna is coming from, but part
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.800]   of me is like there's two places I have any functional remaining ability to have any sort
[00:05:19.800 --> 00:05:22.120]   of sense of suspension of disbelief.
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:27.400]   One of them is watching movies and the other one is looking at space imagery.
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:33.440]   So this was kind of like, wait, is this the difference between the data that's coming
[00:05:33.440 --> 00:05:40.440]   and that they're enhancing and just the idea that it's that much better to use highly sophisticated
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:43.080]   technical terminology?
[00:05:43.080 --> 00:05:48.440]   I'm just going to be delighted and be charmed and we'll see what rolls out of it.
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.440]   For sure.
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:53.080]   I think it was really, yeah, norm, norm, thoughts.
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:54.920]   I want like pure geek awe.
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.120]   I want to know how you guys felt seeing these things.
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:06:00.920]   I don't know if you watched the NASA live stream, but those are always fun too.
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:04.960]   That was much more fun than the press conference and I think a little bit of that anticipation.
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:10.960]   Following it, having one window with the TV, one window with the signed Twitter and everyone
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.480]   freaking out, that is much joy.
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:16.840]   I almost had that vibe of like a rocket launch, right, the anticipation.
[00:06:16.840 --> 00:06:18.320]   We knew things were going to turn out all right.
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:22.760]   It wasn't like in the very first Hubble blurry images that they had to correct because there's
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:25.200]   no shuttle that's going to go up there.
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:30.720]   And to see that they were so savvy with releasing those direct comparisons and now people have
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:34.320]   now done, you know, animated GIFs to show transitional.
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.320]   It's enhanced.
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:36.320]   It's Star Trek, right?
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:39.520]   They're in the astrophysics lab and Picard's saying enhance and we're actually getting
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:44.800]   these much sharper, much higher resolution images and that's not even taking into account
[00:06:44.800 --> 00:06:47.640]   how fast that they can actually capture this.
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:52.480]   So just the order of magnitude in terms of efficiency, that's super exciting.
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:56.520]   And the fact that this is going to be rolling around for 20 years that we're going to get
[00:06:56.520 --> 00:06:59.080]   images like this, that's super cool too.
[00:06:59.080 --> 00:07:00.080]   I hope so.
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:04.240]   And yeah, it is the, I think it is the amount of work and data that the thing can spit out
[00:07:04.240 --> 00:07:08.400]   because these images, which are some of the most astounding things we've seen, including
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:16.360]   the deepest look into deep space we've had, looking at the Galaxy Cluster Smacks 0723,
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:23.560]   we can't light from over 13 billion years ago, close to the formation of the universe.
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:26.360]   This information, this is one week's worth of data.
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.880]   This is one week's worth of work.
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:32.640]   So just imagine what we're going to learn as this thing is going to be trucking for hopefully
[00:07:32.640 --> 00:07:35.160]   10 years, hopefully longer.
[00:07:35.160 --> 00:07:38.880]   There was already a meteoroid strike, I believe, on one of the mirrors and they were still
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:43.360]   able to get some really easily data and dealing with that.
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:44.360]   There is no way to fix this thing.
[00:07:44.360 --> 00:07:47.400]   If anything goes wrong, it isn't like Hubble, like you mentioned, Norm.
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:52.960]   So we're all just hoping and praying now that James Webb kind of keeps going and produces
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.920]   more interesting data.
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.000]   What are you guys looking forward to seeing from this?
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:03.240]   Because this is humanity changing science we're getting from this machine.
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:10.840]   Well, I think all of us, the thing we're most interested in is, are nearby planets habitable?
[00:08:10.840 --> 00:08:12.720]   Are there signs of extraterrestrial life?
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.240]   I mean, insights into gravity.
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:21.960]   I mean, all the things we do, this big, bold science for that you really need government
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:27.360]   funding to basically advance humanity.
[00:08:27.360 --> 00:08:30.720]   I mean, I think that's what we all want to see.
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:35.440]   I have to admit, when I'm reading some of the coverage of this, and you hear, according
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:40.840]   to astronomers, this indicates waters in this nebula, I'm like, how on earth can you tell
[00:08:40.840 --> 00:08:42.240]   that from so far away?
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:46.720]   I will take the word for it because I don't have a PhD in astrophysics.
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:50.760]   Yep, we are getting a lot of spectrum readings, which tells us a lot, but that's from what
[00:08:50.760 --> 00:08:52.600]   I know.
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:57.040]   I also co-host the Gajah podcast, and we had a great guest on to break that down for
[00:08:57.040 --> 00:08:59.400]   us, Lisa Grossman.
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.000]   She covers a lot of space news, so you can hear more details there.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:07.120]   But in terms of broader things, I think we are expecting more information about exoplanets,
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.800]   and to me, that's really exciting, right?
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:14.160]   Because conceivably, these are things we could visit once we get some faster space travel,
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:16.720]   and it could tell us a lot more.
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:24.160]   We've only known that exoplanets have existed, or at least have proof of them since the mid-90s.
[00:09:24.160 --> 00:09:29.360]   So it is just astounding how far we've come in terms of that data.
[00:09:29.360 --> 00:09:31.120]   It's all just beautiful stuff.
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:32.120]   Yeah.
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:37.120]   I'm really looking forward to just kind of the most maybe second-level effect.
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:41.280]   You're talking about the Hubble photos that we all, maybe growing up, saw in textbooks,
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:44.960]   and I don't know if textbooks are what kids these days have, but there is going to be
[00:09:44.960 --> 00:09:45.960]   no pen to the page.
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:46.960]   I've had apps.
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:47.960]   Exactly.
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:48.960]   So there's no page with the PPI.
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:53.880]   It's going to be dense enough to cover these images, but the kids today, they can enhance
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:09:57.680]   as much as they want because of how they're going to be learning about space.
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:04.000]   And same with writers and storytellers and how there's this wonderful, virtuous feedback
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:10.440]   loop of the stuff that comes out of research and what NASA provides can help better inform
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:19.040]   and change the ways we consume astronomy through maybe pop culture and science fiction.
[00:10:19.040 --> 00:10:26.480]   Like how black holes represented, for example, in science fiction today, all changed the
[00:10:26.480 --> 00:10:29.000]   past 10 years based on new information.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:34.480]   And I can't wait for the writers of Star Trek to take all this data into account and come
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:35.480]   up with creative stories.
[00:10:35.480 --> 00:10:38.040]   What if it makes it worse though?
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:42.040]   Like in Jurassic Park when we found out that the dinosaurs have feathers?
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:44.360]   It looks so much worse.
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.920]   I think they look pretty cool.
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:49.120]   Like a giant terrifying bird, you know.
[00:10:49.120 --> 00:10:51.080]   Have you ever been chased by an ostrich?
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:54.520]   You know, I've never had Big Bird come after me.
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:59.880]   I'm just saying we could have this paradigm in our mind of how some of the stuff works
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.280]   and we can get feathers again.
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:03.360]   So we'll see.
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:04.360]   We can get feathers.
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:06.600]   We can get all sorts of things.
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:11.800]   You know, there's a, you were talking about like, will we ever, I think extraterrestrial
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:16.080]   life is the thing and that a lot of people are excited about Brianna.
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:20.640]   And you know, like that is something I've talked a lot of scientists and people working
[00:11:20.640 --> 00:11:23.400]   in space news as well like journalists.
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:24.600]   People are still excited about that.
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:29.000]   Like it is like the kid in them is coming back out because of this.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:34.440]   We will hopefully be able to detect all sorts of ways to see if we can find life on any
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:35.440]   of these exoplanets.
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:40.680]   We can't tell if they're intelligent or not, but potentially science, potentially methane,
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:41.680]   potentially something.
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:43.600]   Let's hear some alien farts.
[00:11:43.600 --> 00:11:46.760]   Let's, you know, detect some alien farts and that'll tell us a lot.
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:50.040]   We've got a lot of news to let me let me just hear.
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.040]   Let me see.
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:53.040]   I'm laughing as I like to move on.
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:12:00.000]   I'm reconciling, I'm reconciling like unprecedented levels of interstellar, you know, gas between
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.080]   the stars and, you know, the alien fart humor that you just dropped and I'm just sitting
[00:12:05.080 --> 00:12:06.440]   there in a white wall of any tales.
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.760]   That's what we're looking for.
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:09.760]   Web's going to do.
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.400]   I'm going to do the pictures here.
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:14.920]   And speaking of alien farts, let's, let's talk about what's happening with Elon Musk
[00:12:14.920 --> 00:12:16.640]   because that was a big thing.
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:18.640]   That was a big topic during last week's.
[00:12:18.640 --> 00:12:24.040]   And, you know, I feel like the, if the aliens are watching anybody on Earth or they're seeing
[00:12:24.040 --> 00:12:29.840]   what Elon Musk is doing, we've learned more about his crumbling, you know, Twitter deal
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:33.600]   or the deal that he's slowly trying to back out of.
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.760]   So listen to the last episode this week in tech for more on that.
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:40.640]   But this week we learned that Twitter is suing Elon Musk for saying that he's going
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:43.520]   to be backing out of the deal.
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:48.200]   There's a lot of coverage about Twitter workers saying really nobody's in charge right now.
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:53.480]   And last, I saw the last news that I saw is that Elon Musk's lawyers are now saying they're
[00:12:53.480 --> 00:12:59.560]   trying to block the quote unquote warp speed Twitter trial over his $44 billion deal.
[00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:03.960]   I am frankly tired of talking about this man and what he will or won't do.
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:05.320]   But you know what?
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.200]   We have, this is news.
[00:13:07.200 --> 00:13:10.800]   This is news and maybe we can like put a pin in this for a while.
[00:13:10.800 --> 00:13:14.600]   What do you guys think about these latest developments about the Twitter deal in Elon
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:15.600]   Musk?
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:16.600]   Oh boy.
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:18.320]   I think it thoughts about this.
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:23.960]   You know, I first of all, I really think that I'll respect my friends at work in media.
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:28.600]   But I think the analysis of this has gotten way too complicated in many ways.
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.600]   Like look, Tesla stock is in the toilet.
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.400]   It's down by many measures.
[00:13:33.400 --> 00:13:39.240]   His, you know, his net worth is worth 30% less than it was when he initiated this deal.
[00:13:39.240 --> 00:13:43.840]   And I think it's straightforward at this point for him to complete this deal.
[00:13:43.840 --> 00:13:49.040]   You know, $54 billion is an astronomical sum of money.
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:53.520]   And the amount of Tesla stock that he would have to sell to do that would just be more
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:54.960]   than he wants to pay.
[00:13:54.960 --> 00:13:59.240]   You know, he tried to get Silicon Valley to fund it by going to them and making some
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:04.880]   really wild promises about, you know, how the number of users was going to increase with
[00:14:04.880 --> 00:14:11.000]   his plan, things that just, you know, even VCs are looking at and go, this doesn't seem
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:12.960]   tethered to reality here.
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:19.200]   You know, this is a man that respectfully, I think, has played very fast and loose with
[00:14:19.200 --> 00:14:20.200]   the rules.
[00:14:20.200 --> 00:14:26.000]   If you read the lawsuit, you can read like, it's the most human readable lawsuit I've
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.720]   ever seen in my life.
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:33.800]   It talks about Elon Musk just being cavalier and destructive and how he's conducted himself,
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:39.560]   which is part of why, you know, Twitter shares have really been damaged by this whole fiasco.
[00:14:39.560 --> 00:14:41.840]   So I think this is very straightforward.
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:46.600]   You have a billionaire that no one has ever really said no to.
[00:14:46.600 --> 00:14:54.080]   And you have him running head first into the situation with the Chancey Court in Delaware,
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:56.480]   which I'm sorry, they move fast.
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:14:57.480]   They don't have trials.
[00:14:57.480 --> 00:14:59.320]   You have judges looking at this thing.
[00:14:59.320 --> 00:15:02.400]   They don't even have opening statements in that court.
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:07.800]   And Elon Musk is, I believe, going to find out the hard way that these contracts actually
[00:15:07.800 --> 00:15:08.800]   mean things.
[00:15:08.800 --> 00:15:13.240]   Now, I do think at the end of the day, they're going to reach some settlement.
[00:15:13.240 --> 00:15:14.680]   I don't think it'll be $1 billion.
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:18.160]   I think it'll be closer to $5 or $10 billion.
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:23.160]   But this is a man, like, if you look through the history of how he's run Tesla and how
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:28.000]   he's made promises on everything under the sun from Tesla's supercharger networks to
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.200]   full self-driving cars to even funding Tesla at earlier periods where they were in a cash
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:37.640]   crunch, he's just had smoke and mirrors there.
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:42.920]   And I think he's finally going to get a reality check that is eminently called for.
[00:15:42.920 --> 00:15:45.240]   Brianna, I think you have a really good point.
[00:15:45.240 --> 00:15:48.840]   It does seem like he-- this is the way he's lived his life.
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:51.000]   It seems like he's a bored billionaire.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.640]   And everybody has toilet thoughts.
[00:15:53.640 --> 00:15:55.880]   Everybody tweets on the toilet, right?
[00:15:55.880 --> 00:16:00.000]   But when it's Elon Musk, it's like, it is business cat.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:02.040]   I think I should buy a Twitter.
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:03.040]   You know?
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:07.400]   It makes you want to know what his echo chambers are.
[00:16:07.400 --> 00:16:13.280]   Like, you know, there were reports of when he first made that offer of other billionaires
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:18.880]   egging him on feeling like it was in their political interest to do so.
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:23.640]   So he has the voices in his head, the voices on Twitter that he finds pleasure in interacting
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:29.680]   with certainly sounds like the bots were something he, like, it affects him because,
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:34.280]   you know, that's what-- that's what propagates whenever he tweets.
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:35.720]   And I don't think buying Twitter is going to--
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:38.600]   It's probably a large part of his following on Twitter, too, you know?
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:42.240]   So the thing he's complaining about is the thing kind of helping him to seem like a thought
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:43.240]   leader, yeah?
[00:16:43.240 --> 00:16:44.240]   Yeah.
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:45.240]   Yeah.
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:46.240]   I mean, I don't think they're going to throw him in jail, right?
[00:16:46.240 --> 00:16:49.240]   It's going to be a settlement of some kind, maybe more than he wants to pay.
[00:16:49.240 --> 00:16:53.240]   But it's about how he's going to spin it to make it a grievance or make it, you know,
[00:16:53.240 --> 00:16:54.880]   make himself the victim in this.
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:59.800]   And that kind of reinforces his accolades and his followers and the people who back him.
[00:16:59.800 --> 00:17:04.280]   So I think in some way, he's going to come out on top, you know, kind of reinforcing the
[00:17:04.280 --> 00:17:06.960]   messaging he wants to put out there.
[00:17:06.960 --> 00:17:10.240]   But I'm happy that he's going to be parted with at least probably a billion dollars at
[00:17:10.240 --> 00:17:11.240]   some point.
[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:12.240]   I don't think that--
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:13.240]   Yeah, I hope so.
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.240]   --just you wanted either.
[00:17:14.240 --> 00:17:15.240]   Yeah.
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:18.400]   I mean, there was a breakup deal, the breakup fine, but I think was in the initial deals,
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:19.640]   right, around a billion, right?
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:22.200]   So we don't know what this is going to end up being.
[00:17:22.200 --> 00:17:30.280]   But for me, the main takeaway is, man, Twitter's board and Twitter's leadership just really
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:33.520]   kind of-- we're jumping on this deal immediately, right?
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:36.400]   Because it did seem a little too good to be true.
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:39.040]   But the speed with which they just kind of gave up on it.
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:41.440]   And what's his face?
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:44.840]   Twitter CEO Dorsey was just like, yeah, I'm out.
[00:17:44.840 --> 00:17:47.000]   I'm done, or at least--
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.720]   It seemed like everybody was quick to pay out rather than stand for whatever Twitter
[00:17:50.720 --> 00:17:52.720]   is supposed to be.
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:58.520]   I mean, when you look at Tesla stock price, right, being in 2020, I think it's $86 a share.
[00:17:58.520 --> 00:18:04.480]   And at its peak, it was $1,200 in 2020, $2,200 a share.
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:07.200]   Now it's dropped to $923 a share.
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:13.640]   The market capitalization of this company is $750 billion, which is kind of insane.
[00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:17.240]   It is a huge astronomical number.
[00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:26.640]   And this is a guy who already got smacked down by the SEC for his tweets, I think, in 2018,
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:32.240]   where he literally has to have security lawyers run certain hosts he's supposed to put on
[00:18:32.240 --> 00:18:33.240]   Twitter, right?
[00:18:33.240 --> 00:18:34.240]   You know what I mean?
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:36.400]   The SEC is already kind of like, no.
[00:18:36.400 --> 00:18:42.160]   And remember, the SEC, I feel like the SEC could say no a lot more in a lot of different
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:43.160]   areas.
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:49.080]   But this was so egregious that they actually were like, we're going to put down a fine
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:53.640]   that would be really, really skull-crushing if this guy wasn't worth billions already.
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:56.920]   But it's going to be a big number that people are going to notice.
[00:18:56.920 --> 00:19:03.160]   And they need turns around and it basically felt like I can't say that word on a family
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:07.800]   podcast, but I will say blank posting on Twitter.
[00:19:07.800 --> 00:19:13.200]   And then it kind of went from blank posting on Twitter to, you know, you were saying
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:16.080]   like, we're like, you know, a whole bunch of people dog-pile.
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:18.200]   I'm like, yeah, yeah, do it, do it, do it.
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:19.200]   Hit him, hit him, hit him.
[00:19:19.200 --> 00:19:20.200]   Buy it, buy it, buy it.
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:21.680]   Some are more obvious, everybody.
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:22.680]   Yeah.
[00:19:22.680 --> 00:19:23.680]   Yeah.
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:28.720]   I hope you had on my me saying, you know, my engineer friends who have worked for Tesla
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:34.040]   and some of his other companies, there's a very consistent story that you hear with
[00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:40.920]   Elon Musk that basically he will wander into your department and he'll be like, guys,
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:42.720]   I've got this great idea.
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:50.040]   Let's do A, B and C and the engineers are just like, okay, sounds great, man.
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:54.640]   And then they just kind of wait for him to go away and then go back to doing the product
[00:19:54.640 --> 00:19:56.160]   that they're actually developing.
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:59.240]   This is a story I've heard repeatedly.
[00:19:59.240 --> 00:20:03.360]   I did with fact check just one thing very briefly.
[00:20:03.360 --> 00:20:08.480]   I think there's a really common misconception that Elon Musk can just pay $1 billion and
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:09.480]   walk away.
[00:20:09.480 --> 00:20:10.480]   Yeah.
[00:20:10.480 --> 00:20:11.480]   That is not the case.
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:18.360]   So he waived his due diligence on this particular lawsuit as far as going through and looking
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:21.480]   at all the financials, making sure it's sound.
[00:20:21.480 --> 00:20:23.640]   He actually way he was moving so fast.
[00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:26.480]   He waved his right to do that.
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:31.800]   So that $1 billion fee is only if both parties agree to it.
[00:20:31.800 --> 00:20:36.160]   At this point, Twitter's stock, what is it now?
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:41.920]   It's $34, I believe it's somewhere around there from a high of, you know, it's gone down
[00:20:41.920 --> 00:20:42.920]   a lot.
[00:20:42.920 --> 00:20:45.640]   There's a lot of material damage to this company.
[00:20:45.640 --> 00:20:52.280]   So there's really no reason for Twitter to insist on that $1 billion fee when they are
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:54.680]   entitled to so much more.
[00:20:54.680 --> 00:20:58.160]   Just one more really, really important point that I want to make.
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:03.280]   And I hope you don't mind me sharing a personal story on this.
[00:21:03.280 --> 00:21:11.360]   So what I find so interesting is if you read the lawsuit here, they go into great detail
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:17.760]   about why Elon Musk is like he's immature, he's handled this badly, he's conducted himself
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:22.400]   in ways that have hurt Twitter publicly, he has not acted in bad faith.
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:27.560]   Let's sell him this thing that we've built spent decades building.
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:32.600]   It's really ironic that I think of Twitter as a social media network, there's really
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:34.880]   essential for the public interest, right?
[00:21:34.880 --> 00:21:40.640]   So much of the conversation, especially around journalism, is set on Twitter.
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:47.760]   And you have the board that is trying to sell it for ultimately a lot of money here.
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:50.160]   This is the personal story.
[00:21:50.160 --> 00:21:55.400]   A lot of my money is invested with Vanguard, which happens to be one of the top investors
[00:21:55.400 --> 00:21:56.400]   in Twitter.
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:21:58.600]   They held a ton of stock.
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:04.000]   And when this news was announced, I called them up on the phone and we've got enough
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.880]   invested that they'll take our call.
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:12.200]   And I'm like, guys, I told him the story of Gameurkate and all the work that I had done
[00:22:12.200 --> 00:22:18.360]   with Twitter, trying to improve trust to safety issues and harassment on the platform.
[00:22:18.360 --> 00:22:24.480]   And I'm like, you guys are really going to destroy all of this work that I did if you
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:26.480]   sell it to this person.
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:31.520]   And their answer was ultimately, we're going to do whatever we need to do to make money
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:32.520]   in this case.
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:39.320]   And I just think that's so sad that I'm not an anti-capitalist kind of gal.
[00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:40.880]   I'm not socialist.
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:47.680]   But I think all the incentives here are not really aligned with us having competent management
[00:22:47.680 --> 00:22:48.680]   of Twitter.
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:50.720]   I mean, how do you all feel about that?
[00:22:50.720 --> 00:22:52.000]   Absolutely take that point.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.840]   I think that I think Georgia said as much, right?
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:23:00.480]   He kind of his views of Twitter, which is kind of blown beyond what he originally created
[00:23:00.480 --> 00:23:06.280]   for, but it's woven into the fabric of how we communicate.
[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:12.840]   And as a social network, along with all the other ones, have become these essential services
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:18.920]   for communication, but they're all at odds with how they make money and private companies.
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:23.280]   And I don't know if that can ever be reconciled.
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:29.240]   And it feels like regardless of how this lawsuit ends up, Twitter as an entity and as a service,
[00:23:29.240 --> 00:23:35.520]   it's going to be worse off for it as it kind of is losing its relevancy.
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:42.800]   It's fundamentally more important than like a TikTok, which has increased its relevancy
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:48.200]   because of text versus video and the benefits of that.
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:53.000]   But you can see the audience shifting away from Twitter.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:59.520]   But as it becomes more important for the people who make the laws and who enact policy and
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:02.440]   who kind of run the world these days.
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:04.280]   Absolutely.
[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:09.080]   It does seem like just existing as a public company is incompatible with doing the right
[00:24:09.080 --> 00:24:10.080]   thing at times.
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:11.080]   Like what is right?
[00:24:11.080 --> 00:24:13.080]   Right is just making money, I guess.
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:14.080]   Go ahead.
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:15.080]   Okay.
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:19.800]   If a Republican held company right is what maximizes shareholder value on a quarterly basis period
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:20.800]   under discussion, right?
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:25.200]   I don't think there's anybody in this panel that's going to look and come up with a long
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:30.800]   list of companies that made strategic long-term decisions to benefit their customers and the
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:34.160]   product over not getting sued by a minority shareholder, right?
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:38.640]   That's life in the 21st century with the publicly held bills in the business.
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:43.800]   It was funny because when Brianna, when Vanguard came out and started talking about Twitter,
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:50.640]   I remember being like, "Oh my gosh, there's an adult in the room and their fist."
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:51.640]   Right?
[00:24:51.640 --> 00:24:54.720]   Because I mean literally, Twitter started speaking about this.
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:56.400]   Excuse me, Vanguard started speaking about this.
[00:24:56.400 --> 00:24:59.840]   I'm like, "Wow, Vanguard's got a huge amount of money tied up here and they're really
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:03.760]   irritated because the stock value is going berserk and on one hand they can make a whole
[00:25:03.760 --> 00:25:09.320]   bunch of money and on the other hand, this could end up damaging Twitter."
[00:25:09.320 --> 00:25:17.240]   To kind of look at anybody who's worked for a venture capital funded company or any of
[00:25:17.240 --> 00:25:23.080]   a number of companies in the Silicon Valley of War where there's moments where you're
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:28.440]   like, "We have a product, we have a plan, or if you've watched from the outside," you
[00:25:28.440 --> 00:25:31.240]   can be like, "Oh wow, so that was going to be this really cool standalone thing and
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:38.760]   now it's a subset of an app on some corner of Google or it gets purchased and disintegrated
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:44.680]   by Mega Company X or they had a chance to sell out and management runs and then something
[00:25:44.680 --> 00:25:46.040]   else happens.
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:50.600]   I think for a lot of people they were in the Twitter minds, they're managing, they're
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:55.000]   grinding through, they're dealing with all the issues and then all of a sudden the possibility
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:00.920]   of maybe all of those shares vesting and being worth way more than they expected any time
[00:26:00.920 --> 00:26:02.480]   in the near future.
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:07.080]   It just sounded great.
[00:26:07.080 --> 00:26:13.880]   I can also totally see if there's any kind of acrimony internally in Twitter and direction
[00:26:13.880 --> 00:26:19.400]   that as soon as people are like, "Elon's going to command and he's going to do all this stuff."
[00:26:19.400 --> 00:26:26.120]   I can totally see internally all sorts of splits just starting to happen.
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:33.200]   As somebody who worked at a company that went through multiple rounds of layoffs, aligning,
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:39.280]   spending with a possible acquisition, thinking of tech TV at the particular moment, it is
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:42.400]   really hard to deal with morale where people are like, "Are we getting bought?
[00:26:42.400 --> 00:26:43.400]   Are we not getting bought?
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:44.920]   Dude, did the stock value just tank?
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:46.160]   Is the stock value going to be okay?
[00:26:46.160 --> 00:26:47.160]   What is going on here?
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:48.160]   Who's going to have this?
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:50.840]   Dude, everything I do, Brandon put in, has everything we've done to try to make this
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:57.760]   less toxic place about to get flushed?"
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:01.200]   It's messy and I don't blame Twitter at this point.
[00:27:01.200 --> 00:27:05.000]   I can totally see them being like, "We're going to maximize shareholder value, Elon.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.040]   Get your lawyers ready.
[00:27:09.040 --> 00:27:15.360]   Yeah, this is ugly and annoying and it's gone on way too long and it's going to be really
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:18.920]   interesting to see how this happens."
[00:27:18.920 --> 00:27:22.040]   I always love when people are like, "We picked a fight.
[00:27:22.040 --> 00:27:23.320]   Let's move the fight to February next year.
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:25.280]   Can we move to a couple of years from now?
[00:27:25.280 --> 00:27:26.280]   Let's just play this."
[00:27:26.280 --> 00:27:33.360]   It's like, you know, Brandon Collins like, "Yeah, the courts have no time for your agenda.
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:34.360]   Good luck."
[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:40.440]   I think it's really interesting if you actually look at the legal team that Twitter hired
[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:41.440]   here.
[00:27:41.440 --> 00:27:42.960]   They are not messing around.
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:48.680]   This is why if you read all the expert legal analysis of this, if you're a betting woman
[00:27:48.680 --> 00:27:55.280]   or a betting man, Twitter absolutely has the stronger hand here.
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:28:01.560]   I understand Elon must need to save face and to say, "This is about bots.
[00:28:01.560 --> 00:28:03.520]   This is about blah, blah, blah."
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:10.120]   He can ask us to his heart's content here, but the bottom line is that contract is when
[00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:17.360]   it is, he decided to forego due diligence and I think he's going to face some consequences
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:18.360]   here.
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:22.200]   Unfortunately, I hope it's a settlement.
[00:28:22.200 --> 00:28:25.840]   Can we have a discussion about this?
[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:32.880]   When Jack stepped down as CEO of Twitter to go focus on Web 3, which is a whole other
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:41.640]   discussion, can we just admit that Twitter's new leadership is not the best?
[00:28:41.640 --> 00:28:47.200]   I do not have any confidence in the way the ship is being steered right now.
[00:28:47.200 --> 00:28:51.560]   The people I know that work there don't have good things to say.
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:56.480]   Frankly, I think it's time for a new CEO and maybe even a new board after this whole
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:29:02.000]   saga is over because I think they've had a hard hand dealt to them, but I don't think
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.880]   they've played it well.
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:08.080]   Yeah, it seems like we are going to see a fundamental reshaping of whatever Twitter
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:09.080]   is.
[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:12.320]   It is sad because I think we've talked about this before on Twitter.
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:14.520]   It is among the social networks out there right now.
[00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:21.200]   I think it's the one closest to showing us the full depth of humanity in a certain sense.
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:25.680]   I've always thought of Twitter as the way they talk about in the Matrix, just sitting
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:29.520]   down watching the code fall and sometimes looking at Twitter as like, "Oh, this is just
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:30.840]   everything on Earth at once."
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:34.920]   It's probably too much and it's super toxic at times, but, "Oh man, have I made friends
[00:29:34.920 --> 00:29:35.920]   there?
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:37.360]   Have I learned a lot from Twitter?
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:40.240]   It is the thing that keeps me tapped into the world."
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:44.960]   Hopefully, what you're saying is true, Brianna, and I hope it gets reshaped.
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:46.960]   Prague, Agorwal is an ECO.
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:49.360]   Yeah, I've not heard good things.
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:51.600]   I know some people who work there as well.
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:56.040]   Things just seem really, really rough over in Twitter land.
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:30:00.280]   We're hoping things work out for the people there and the people who are staying there.
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:02.800]   Anything else you guys want to add to this whole mess?
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:04.840]   I just want to talk about Elon Musk anymore.
[00:30:04.840 --> 00:30:06.600]   Well, let's put out there.
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:08.640]   Are we prepared for a post-Twitter world?
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:11.000]   Nothing lasts forever.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:16.360]   How do you guys feel if Twitter went away in the next couple of years?
[00:30:16.360 --> 00:30:18.800]   What do you think would fill that void?
[00:30:18.800 --> 00:30:23.480]   Would that be a good thing, a bad thing?
[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:27.800]   It's kind of impossible often that.
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:31.240]   Norm, you called out TikTok.
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:37.720]   On one hand, there's certain things where I can be like contractor videos showing wiring,
[00:30:37.720 --> 00:30:43.000]   tree toppers, technique for tuck pointing brick, man.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:45.400]   I am all over TikTok.
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:48.840]   There's a lot of people whose information, who give me information, or give me leads
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:53.640]   to articles to read that I get on Twitter that I just don't really see.
[00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:58.640]   Do you know what I mean?
[00:30:58.640 --> 00:30:59.640]   Yes, not sure.
[00:30:59.640 --> 00:31:01.640]   It doesn't have to be a show.
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:02.640]   Micron.
[00:31:02.640 --> 00:31:03.640]   You know what I mean?
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:08.120]   I don't necessarily want to consume video about this.
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:10.080]   Even super clever short videos.
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:14.400]   I just want to read this and decide whether or not I'm going to get deeper into it.
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:16.280]   That's been a challenge, I think, overall media.
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:18.520]   There's so many platforms.
[00:31:18.520 --> 00:31:20.200]   It was about 18 months, two years ago.
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:23.560]   I remember reading things like, "Our audience has demanded more video
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:24.560]   content."
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:29.520]   In response, we've created and they fire a whole bunch of their writers and they start
[00:31:29.520 --> 00:31:30.520]   producing video.
[00:31:30.520 --> 00:31:31.840]   Yeah, I get it.
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:32.920]   They're responding.
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:36.440]   The money in video looks better than the money in banner ads and they have to move and they
[00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:39.040]   have to keep people paid.
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:42.920]   On the other hand, you're sitting there like, "Oh gosh, now I have to wait for a video to
[00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:44.920]   queue and launch and get through the opening.
[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:49.280]   Oh goodness, they're using the microphone on their laptop and they don't have any treatment
[00:31:49.280 --> 00:31:51.440]   in their room and they don't have anything on the walls.
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:57.600]   I'm here in the giant echo and I just want to hear about what's going on with this thing."
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:58.800]   I think it's all going to be messy.
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:03.280]   I think Twitter, people have been particularly thinking the death of Facebook, "Twins are
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:04.280]   not on Facebook.
[00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:06.360]   Teens are leaving Facebook because their parents are there."
[00:32:06.360 --> 00:32:10.960]   It's like, "Man, Facebook just lurks there in the corner like a gigantic supermarket chain
[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:15.560]   like, "Yeah, we're dying."
[00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:19.400]   But they just, I think it's just going to go on for a while.
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:22.560]   If I'm completely wrong on this, feel free to mock me in the future.
[00:32:22.560 --> 00:32:24.560]   I don't know.
[00:32:24.560 --> 00:32:33.200]   I'm telling you right now, if I have to get a TikTok, I will pinball feminism, get out
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.200]   there and vote.
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:35.800]   I will do that if I have to.
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:39.080]   I will find a way to adjust that to my brand.
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:41.360]   I would prefer not to do that.
[00:32:41.360 --> 00:32:44.200]   I just want to say, "Look, I'm an engineer.
[00:32:44.200 --> 00:32:45.200]   I'm a techie.
[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:46.200]   I'm one of you.
[00:32:46.200 --> 00:32:48.880]   I know many of us want Mastronon to happen.
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:50.760]   Mastronon is not going to happen at all."
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:52.760]   Yeah, stop trying to make fetch happen.
[00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:53.760]   Yeah.
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:56.000]   It's just not going to happen for mass people.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:03.760]   I wish we lived in a world where normal people would put out what bad UI decisions.
[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:06.440]   I saw a majority report this week.
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:08.520]   Someone came in and got help him.
[00:33:08.520 --> 00:33:09.760]   He's an engineer.
[00:33:09.760 --> 00:33:10.760]   I love him.
[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:13.560]   He's doing Linux stuff back in the 90s.
[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:18.840]   He's like, "We're going to start these federated communities and we can link Mastronons together
[00:33:18.840 --> 00:33:19.840]   and overcome Facebook."
[00:33:19.840 --> 00:33:21.840]   I'm like, "That's like…"
[00:33:21.840 --> 00:33:24.640]   That's how that work effects work.
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:26.640]   Bless your heart.
[00:33:26.640 --> 00:33:32.720]   It's like freeing open source people.
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:35.960]   When I ran for office, I believe in freeing open source.
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:39.640]   It's this freeing open source people that believe all software is going to be free
[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:41.120]   and open source.
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:45.120]   You're praying for a future that's never going to happen.
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:47.320]   I just urge you to come back to reality.
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:48.560]   Well, you know what, guys?
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:53.200]   I want to keep talking more about this, but I believe we have Leo here with a word from
[00:33:53.200 --> 00:33:54.200]   our sponsor.
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:56.320]   Hey, everybody.
[00:33:56.320 --> 00:33:57.920]   Thank you, Devendra, for filling in for me.
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:58.920]   Leo Laport here.
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:03.120]   Yes, I know I'm on a boat, but you know what I brought with me on my boat?
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:06.240]   I brought with me my iPhone SE with Mint Mobile.
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:07.920]   You better believe it.
[00:34:07.920 --> 00:34:08.920]   I love Mint Mobile.
[00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:15.040]   In fact, I hear from people all the time about how great Mint Mobile is, the best coverage,
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:17.240]   the lowest cost.
[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:22.720]   And now with the Mint Mobile Modern Family Plan, every line starts at $15 a month.
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:26.440]   And you only need two people to get started, two lines to get started.
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:31.200]   You know, those big wireless providers, they're not human scale and they forget.
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:33.480]   Families come in all shapes and sizes.
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:37.560]   That's why Mint Mobile decided to continue to shake up the wireless industry with a brand
[00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:39.520]   new Modern Family Plan.
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:43.000]   It doesn't matter how big or small your family is.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.920]   You deserve to save on your wireless service, $15 a month.
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:47.920]   What do you get?
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:54.240]   Well, you get unlimited nationwide talk and text plus high speed data delivers on the
[00:34:54.240 --> 00:34:58.640]   nation's largest 5G network.
[00:34:58.640 --> 00:35:00.160]   It's amazing.
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:04.920]   And it's the best rate whether you're buying for one or a family.
[00:35:04.920 --> 00:35:07.920]   Mint family start with just two people at two lines.
[00:35:07.920 --> 00:35:10.120]   Now what you should do is look at your current phone bill.
[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:16.240]   Once you get over the shock, looking at that bottom line, look at how much data you use
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:17.360]   every month.
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:19.200]   Then you can choose a Mint Mobile Plan.
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:20.200]   That's right for you.
[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:21.200]   They do have unlimited plans.
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:24.520]   I think for a lot of people you're overpaying for data.
[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:26.760]   You're paying for data you'll never use.
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:31.880]   And Mint Mobile's Modern Family Plan is nice because you can mix and match data plans.
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:37.560]   So mom might want $15 dad gets the 8 gig plan.
[00:35:37.560 --> 00:35:39.120]   I might want the 15 gig plan.
[00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:40.920]   You get to choose.
[00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:42.640]   You can bring your own phone with Mint Mobile.
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:46.560]   In fact, unlike a lot of other carriers they'll send you a SIM for free.
[00:35:46.560 --> 00:35:47.880]   You put it on the phone.
[00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:49.040]   Now it's a Mint Mobile phone.
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:50.040]   You keep your contacts.
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:51.960]   Keep all that information on the phone.
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:54.120]   You can even port the phone number over.
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:56.280]   So you have the same phone number.
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:57.280]   They also sell phones.
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:00.440]   That's where I got my iPhone SE for a really, really good price.
[00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:04.160]   I think Mint Mobile is transforming the wireless business.
[00:36:04.160 --> 00:36:05.160]   And I'm a big fan.
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:06.600]   I tell everybody about it.
[00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:11.480]   Switch to Mint Mobile, premium wireless service, starting at $15 a month.
[00:36:11.480 --> 00:36:16.760]   The new Modern Family Plan, a great deal starting with just two lines to as many as
[00:36:16.760 --> 00:36:17.760]   you need.
[00:36:17.760 --> 00:36:21.240]   Get your new wireless plan for just $15 a month, including the Modern Family Plan at
[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:23.880]   mintmobile.com/twent.
[00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:28.440]   Mint, like that minty fresh flavor you get when you get your new phone.
[00:36:28.440 --> 00:36:31.240]   Mintmobile.com/twent.
[00:36:31.240 --> 00:36:35.400]   Cut your wireless bill to $15 a month.
[00:36:35.400 --> 00:36:36.400]   And I'm not kidding.
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:39.480]   For most people, that's how much they pay.
[00:36:39.480 --> 00:36:41.560]   Look at your current wireless bill and compare.
[00:36:41.560 --> 00:36:43.400]   You won't believe the difference.
[00:36:43.400 --> 00:36:44.600]   $15 a month.
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:47.960]   Mintmobile.com/twent.
[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:51.440]   We thank you, Mint Mobile, for your support of this week in tech.
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:53.400]   Now back to the vendor and the gang.
[00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:58.520]   Brianna, you know, I went to keep talking about your idea, right?
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:36:59.760]   Just you guys in general, right?
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:02.240]   What will a post to Twitter world look like?
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:04.480]   And I honestly don't know.
[00:37:04.480 --> 00:37:10.080]   I wish it were messed on, but it feels like the RSS revolution failed, right?
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:15.680]   With Google Reader dying and with kind of having a way to sift through all of our media,
[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:20.360]   I feel like Twitter became the thing that was both information dumping on you, plus
[00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:25.040]   you can actually chat with people and make connections with people.
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:28.800]   I don't know what it looks like, but I will certainly miss it if it leaves.
[00:37:28.800 --> 00:37:31.760]   I don't know about you guys.
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:33.480]   I would miss it.
[00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:38.480]   I have made so many real life friends there.
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:40.280]   I mean, here's a guy.
[00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:44.760]   You know, like, I mean, we met each other on Twitter, I think, primarily.
[00:37:44.760 --> 00:37:49.040]   And, you know, like, I'm always delighted when you're in my feed.
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:51.120]   There's a woman that works at Harvard.
[00:37:51.120 --> 00:37:55.080]   I'm going to invite her as soon as I get off here to come by my house for dinner.
[00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:57.160]   Letters we kept dinner with my husband and I.
[00:37:57.160 --> 00:38:05.520]   I've made so many friends, like professional acquaintances there, just as far as, you know,
[00:38:05.520 --> 00:38:06.680]   getting to know journalists.
[00:38:06.680 --> 00:38:09.280]   I've made so many important connections there.
[00:38:09.280 --> 00:38:12.040]   So my heart would break if it went away.
[00:38:12.040 --> 00:38:13.040]   Yeah.
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:17.560]   And part of me is curious about every social network, you know, for it to kind of succeed,
[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:20.160]   needs to find a way to have that reach to be shareable, right?
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:24.160]   I think one of the reasons TikTok is so successful is because it's so shareable.
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:25.560]   They made it easy to put a link to.
[00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:29.080]   People are just kind of swipes-wipes-wipes consuming, consuming, consuming.
[00:38:29.080 --> 00:38:33.640]   And I'm less interested about, you know, what percent of Twitter users are bots as opposed
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:38.960]   to what percentage of Twitter users are using in a way to find connections and meet new
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:45.120]   people and actually engage or just want to click links and see links and consume content,
[00:38:45.120 --> 00:38:46.520]   which I know we all want to do.
[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:50.520]   But I think that's kind of that's that that feels like, you know, the thing that push
[00:38:50.520 --> 00:38:52.920]   and pull of the future of Twitter.
[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:53.920]   Yeah.
[00:38:53.920 --> 00:38:58.280]   The specific niche that Twitter offers right now too is like, yeah, Patrick, I hear you
[00:38:58.280 --> 00:38:59.280]   about the TikToks as well.
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:02.000]   I feel that about YouTube as well when there's so many great YouTube explainers.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:08.160]   And I'm like, great, I love you made a 30 minute video about this one really niche topic.
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:11.400]   Is there a link to text for me that just scan?
[00:39:11.400 --> 00:39:13.240]   I have five minutes, you know?
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:14.240]   Yeah.
[00:39:14.240 --> 00:39:15.240]   Pro tip for you.
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:18.480]   If you turn on closed captioning, just search the closed captioning.
[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:22.440]   That's the trick to get through or just skip the first, you know, the first, what is it?
[00:39:22.440 --> 00:39:23.440]   20%.
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:25.440]   The Reddit role for every YouTube video.
[00:39:25.440 --> 00:39:30.800]   Well, it's funny because YouTube, I was going to say, well, YouTube is today is not
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:32.520]   how YouTube was three years ago.
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:35.720]   It's not what YouTube was five or eight years ago, right?
[00:39:35.720 --> 00:39:39.760]   The way the algorithm pushes things is radically changed into the duration of videos and type
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:40.760]   of videos they do.
[00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:43.680]   You know, TikTok has already started to add longer videos.
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:47.080]   So it's going to be interesting to see how that impacts and how their algorithm changes
[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:49.840]   what you see and what you expect from it.
[00:39:49.840 --> 00:39:50.840]   Yeah.
[00:39:50.840 --> 00:39:52.080]   I think it happens with every platform.
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:57.320]   You know, I would probably pay a monthly fee to Twitter if they would just let me see
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:00.600]   everything in the order it was posted, right?
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:03.040]   Well, you can.
[00:40:03.040 --> 00:40:07.240]   They just keep trying to change it on you, you know, without your permission.
[00:40:07.240 --> 00:40:08.240]   Yeah.
[00:40:08.240 --> 00:40:09.240]   That's a weird thing.
[00:40:09.240 --> 00:40:10.240]   Yeah.
[00:40:10.240 --> 00:40:14.360]   Maybe if they, you know, I would pay money, which would probably provide them more income
[00:40:14.360 --> 00:40:19.520]   off of any amount of ads I could possibly be fed on that feed, you know, if they, you
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:22.000]   know, I would be sure you mean to edit button in case.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:25.920]   You may spell, you know, you can note, you can keep a link to the previous version and
[00:40:25.920 --> 00:40:26.920]   the, and the post for it.
[00:40:26.920 --> 00:40:31.760]   I don't care, but it would be nice if there may be more responsive to thing people keep
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:35.040]   asking for over and over again and have for years and years and years.
[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:36.040]   I don't know.
[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:37.040]   We'll see what happens.
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:42.520]   I would literally pay a thousand dollars that when I get like a rate spread or a death
[00:40:42.520 --> 00:40:45.960]   spread is someone would actually respond to it.
[00:40:45.960 --> 00:40:47.960]   You should not have to.
[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:51.800]   You know, I would pay any amount of money for that Twitter blue.
[00:40:51.800 --> 00:40:59.560]   I thought was, you know, it debuted before Elon like announced it or trying to get Twitter.
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:00.560]   Right.
[00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:03.560]   I was one of the people that the subscribe to it because I love Twitter.
[00:41:03.560 --> 00:41:05.280]   I want to give them money.
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:08.520]   But what are the things that they offered you for that?
[00:41:08.520 --> 00:41:13.920]   They like some, some ad free versions of articles from box.
[00:41:13.920 --> 00:41:14.920]   I love box media.
[00:41:14.920 --> 00:41:20.080]   I would love to pay for box, but that's not worth the money and the basically a fake edit
[00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:22.680]   button where you can take back a tweet.
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:24.320]   30 seconds.
[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:28.160]   Yeah, which I contend is the only way and that it button will actually work.
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:32.600]   But okay, you know, like I'm paying for Twitter bleed just for that.
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:36.200]   Let's let's move on to another platform that's having its own issues, folks.
[00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:38.480]   And that is specifically medium.
[00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:42.760]   Evan Williams, the CEO of medium announced that he is stepping down from his role.
[00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:49.400]   He's going to be replaced with an UCAO medium felt like the company that should have been
[00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:51.600]   like the logical extension of Twitter, right?
[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:57.200]   Like if short thoughts are good, long thoughts should be better, right?
[00:41:57.200 --> 00:42:00.360]   Except they still don't think medium has any clue what it is.
[00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:04.560]   It seems like when F Williams started to think several clues.
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:05.560]   Yeah.
[00:42:05.560 --> 00:42:06.560]   Yeah.
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:07.560]   Well, go ahead.
[00:42:07.560 --> 00:42:08.560]   Changing.
[00:42:08.560 --> 00:42:09.800]   Well, this is a guy who.
[00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:15.200]   Yeah, this is a guy who basically made blogging practical and then blogging was too long.
[00:42:15.200 --> 00:42:18.480]   So Twitter happened and then I think it was just like, well, maybe this is out of control
[00:42:18.480 --> 00:42:23.560]   and I can't actually handle following a hundred people getting 273,000 tweets a day.
[00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:28.400]   So I'm going to have long, thoughtful, engaging content.
[00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:33.400]   And then I'm going to change the plan every couple of years, every 18 months, every six
[00:42:33.400 --> 00:42:34.400]   months.
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:36.840]   I mean, you read some of these articles and it's brutal because it was like, and then we
[00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:38.520]   did this, then we did this, and then we did this.
[00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:44.840]   And mostly it's like as somebody who's written or created video for, you know, it's just
[00:42:44.840 --> 00:42:49.000]   like, and then we did this to the content creators and we did this to the content creators
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   and we did that.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.520]   We're going to pay you by, you know, and it's kind of crazy when you look at some of the
[00:42:53.520 --> 00:42:57.200]   models they were, you know, oh, if you get a clap, you'll get paid.
[00:42:57.200 --> 00:42:58.840]   If you get more claps, you get paid more.
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:00.920]   And it's like, does anybody know about the claps?
[00:43:00.920 --> 00:43:02.680]   I even, I don't think you're, I don't think you're, I would say.
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:04.040]   Are we Tinkerbell fairies over here?
[00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:05.040]   Yeah.
[00:43:05.040 --> 00:43:06.040]   Yeah.
[00:43:06.040 --> 00:43:08.360]   You know, if it gets me paid, make me a Tinkerbell fairy.
[00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:13.220]   I'm happy, but, you know, I don't think anybody ever got paid or it ever scaled in the way they
[00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:14.220]   wanted to.
[00:43:14.220 --> 00:43:15.220]   Yeah.
[00:43:15.220 --> 00:43:17.600]   It's kind of had a spin by a sub stack, right?
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:24.400]   I mean, and the whole direct audience subscription model, which reminds me of like, of like,
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:29.400]   internet radio where you had Pandora, which is free to use and they struggled to make
[00:43:29.400 --> 00:43:35.040]   money because you kind of difficult to go from free listening to asking people to pay,
[00:43:35.040 --> 00:43:40.800]   which is only the only really sustainable model at that scale to Spotify, which started
[00:43:40.800 --> 00:43:46.080]   as a paid model and did direct negotiations with, with the rights holders.
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:48.400]   I think it's the same thing with, you know, medium starting free.
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:50.240]   You get the big audience, right?
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:55.920]   But it's kind of at long term, not necessarily sustainable, where a sub stack you start off
[00:43:55.920 --> 00:44:00.560]   with the paid model and you can start small and grow from there.
[00:44:00.560 --> 00:44:01.560]   Mm hmm.
[00:44:01.560 --> 00:44:03.360]   It is, it is just funny.
[00:44:03.360 --> 00:44:09.320]   Like I reporter friends of mine, multiple ones of them actually have run into have Williams,
[00:44:09.320 --> 00:44:12.560]   especially back when he started medium and they would talk to him about it and he'd
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:15.440]   be like, uh, they'd be like, how's it going?
[00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:20.720]   And he's like, I don't know, you know, like, I don't know what this company is.
[00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:22.320]   And that was, what is it?
[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:23.320]   2022?
[00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:24.320]   That was a decade ago.
[00:44:24.320 --> 00:44:25.320]   Mm hmm.
[00:44:25.320 --> 00:44:28.280]   And it seems like, yeah, they, they are still kind of having the same problems.
[00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:31.600]   It is weird that medium is essentially let's, let's, uh, let's make it easy for people
[00:44:31.600 --> 00:44:36.760]   to write on the internet as if, yeah, blogger or WordPress or literally any other tool
[00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:37.760]   didn't exist.
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:38.760]   So I don't know.
[00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:40.840]   Do you guys have any love for medium at all?
[00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:42.320]   Oh, I do.
[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:48.600]   Um, you know, maybe y'all have a, well, you wouldn't like come across this, but medium,
[00:44:48.600 --> 00:44:53.320]   I have a soft spot in my heart for them just because every time there's a, like, a big
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:59.560]   tech event in San Francisco, there's always like in a secret meeting for the women in
[00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:03.640]   tech, like over at medium, the whole, which I've, I've always appreciated.
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:09.600]   I mean, that's very valuable space during something like WWDC where you'd be able to
[00:45:09.600 --> 00:45:10.600]   get contact.
[00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:14.280]   So I've always been deeply, uh, appreciative of that.
[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:18.320]   Um, you know, normally I do agree with you this, the difference between starting with
[00:45:18.320 --> 00:45:22.360]   the paid model and starting with basically a blogging model, which everyone out there
[00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:23.800]   will let you do.
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:29.520]   I think if you want to get to the really core thing going on, I think this is, you know,
[00:45:29.520 --> 00:45:36.160]   this is something, you know, like y'all should be upset about, which is how hard it is for
[00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:43.280]   writers to make money with the, the basically ad duopoly that's going on, you know, Google
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:44.280]   and Facebook.
[00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:50.320]   Um, you know, we have people like the human race overall is reading more than we have
[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:51.320]   ever read before.
[00:45:51.320 --> 00:45:52.320]   Yeah.
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:58.000]   Just as a matter of time and hours and material, we're spending more time doing it, but the
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:04.240]   amount like content creators are being paid for a CPM keys going down and down and down
[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:05.600]   and down.
[00:46:05.600 --> 00:46:12.480]   And I see medium as, as trying to be a good steward of, of that saying, look, we're going
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:18.440]   to try to like make a page, make it readable, make it easy to use, make it easy to link
[00:46:18.440 --> 00:46:24.000]   and just running into that reality that, you know, Google is going to keep and drain
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:27.360]   every last time that they can and keep it from themselves.
[00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:33.720]   So, um, I really see it as like a victim of these larger market forces that I think is,
[00:46:33.720 --> 00:46:37.120]   is bad for, you know, journalists and writers in my opinion.
[00:46:37.120 --> 00:46:38.120]   Absolutely.
[00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:39.120]   Mm hmm.
[00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:40.800]   It's not like, it's not like I had issues with medium as a company.
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:44.680]   I wish it was more focused, but it does speak to, yeah, writing is hard.
[00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:46.120]   Being a journalist is hard.
[00:46:46.120 --> 00:46:50.520]   It's a media right now is, is incredibly, incredibly difficult.
[00:46:50.520 --> 00:46:55.200]   Um, anything else you guys want to add to the medium thoughts here?
[00:46:55.200 --> 00:46:57.520]   I love how readable and how well presented that stuff.
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:01.240]   And there's certainly an incredible value to that user experience.
[00:47:01.240 --> 00:47:05.640]   But I think, I think maybe kind of ties the thoughts on like TikTok is, you know, of
[00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:11.000]   course, at first glance, my reaction as an, as an internet old is, you know, this is scary,
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:12.200]   this is new, this is different.
[00:47:12.200 --> 00:47:13.800]   It's too noisy.
[00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:18.880]   But there's a lot of credit to be given for how those creators are taking advantage of
[00:47:18.880 --> 00:47:23.280]   those platforms and understanding the nuances of how to create content for those platforms
[00:47:23.280 --> 00:47:25.280]   that I don't want to dismiss.
[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:30.200]   And they put just as much effort into finessing their content for those platforms.
[00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:34.120]   I think the same way works for techs and I love techs, you know, leveraging the indexability
[00:47:34.120 --> 00:47:37.360]   of techs, I think isn't something that video is going to be, is going to be able to approach
[00:47:37.360 --> 00:47:38.640]   anytime soon.
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:41.840]   And it's been a problem for video, but you know, one thing I think about in terms of
[00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:47.600]   like SEO and poor CPMs is how, for example, like recipe writers, right, um, how they have
[00:47:47.600 --> 00:47:53.800]   kind of leveraged their format and finesse their format to work with, you know, and kind
[00:47:53.800 --> 00:48:00.480]   of the unfortunate realities of poor CPM and, and, and, and Google dominated landscape
[00:48:00.480 --> 00:48:03.840]   to, to survive and make money.
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:07.040]   And it's kind of a form of its own.
[00:48:07.040 --> 00:48:08.040]   Absolutely.
[00:48:08.040 --> 00:48:13.440]   I mean, I spend a lot of time on TikTok these days, mainly because my daughter is really
[00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:17.480]   into it and it is, it is really interesting to see like a whole new medium, whole new
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:22.000]   medium, kind of form in real time too, because people are just learning about it.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:26.440]   So there's something exciting about TikTok, but it's also like, if you guys remember so
[00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:30.440]   many of the like, um, some of the early Black Mirror episodes, I think like, uh, was it
[00:48:30.440 --> 00:48:31.880]   10 million merits?
[00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:40.040]   Uh, like one of those really early ones, that idea of a super poppy, super like, uh, a platform
[00:48:40.040 --> 00:48:44.680]   where you always kind of have to perform in a sense, TikTok is also like the distillation
[00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:45.680]   of all that.
[00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:48.720]   So it is, it is both like really compelling and kind of scary to me.
[00:48:48.720 --> 00:48:49.720]   Yeah.
[00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:53.120]   I just don't know how you get the olds on there.
[00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:56.560]   I really don't like it's a format made.
[00:48:56.560 --> 00:48:58.360]   Not everybody has to be on it.
[00:48:58.360 --> 00:48:59.360]   Yeah.
[00:48:59.360 --> 00:49:00.360]   Yeah.
[00:49:00.360 --> 00:49:01.360]   It really does.
[00:49:01.360 --> 00:49:05.920]   But I also laugh because a, a friend of mine has a couple of nieces and he was like,
[00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:09.960]   I went on TikTok and I was horrified, you know, and it literally sounds, I hear, I
[00:49:09.960 --> 00:49:14.840]   hear Alec Guinness's voice in my head, a villainy of, of, you know, a high of a villainy and
[00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:16.680]   scum scum and villainy.
[00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:22.120]   Um, and I was laughing because I was like, I was like, I watched like an hour of, you
[00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:27.360]   know, construction, DIY and some diesel stuff on there earlier and a whole bunch of nature
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:28.360]   stuff.
[00:49:28.360 --> 00:49:30.000]   So it's all keyword based.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:34.080]   What exactly did you start searching on at TikTok and I'm late to you.
[00:49:34.080 --> 00:49:35.080]   You're feeding it, right?
[00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:36.080]   You're feeding it.
[00:49:36.080 --> 00:49:37.080]   Yeah.
[00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:39.960]   You're feeding the wrong wolf here, man.
[00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:44.000]   You know, and that's what, so, you know, TikTok is a really surreal place and that it really
[00:49:44.000 --> 00:49:45.960]   feeds you what you want.
[00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:50.200]   And, and he was just, he was just kind of, yeah, I could actually feel him sort of like
[00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:55.920]   leaning back on the phone, kind of horrified that he was actually responsible for generating
[00:49:55.920 --> 00:50:00.720]   the, you know, I may, if you clicked on this, you get this, you get more of this and it's
[00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:01.840]   just the way it works.
[00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:04.840]   They don't really care which creators are out there unless you subscribe to them.
[00:50:04.840 --> 00:50:07.080]   It's all about keywords and stuff.
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:12.440]   And, you know, and it was, but it's like, it's interesting to watch, right?
[00:50:12.440 --> 00:50:16.600]   Because at some point, I think the rule of thumb at this stage is like, if the olds are
[00:50:16.600 --> 00:50:23.080]   on there, then it's dead or you just happen to be a bleeding edge old and it's, you know,
[00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:27.120]   I enjoy a lot of the videos in there because it's fun to watch electricians show off what
[00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:28.440]   they do and how they do it.
[00:50:28.440 --> 00:50:34.800]   And it also allows me to look around my house and go, oh, thinking even more so than I was
[00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:39.800]   out, you know, before watching, you know, 150 TikTok electrician videos, but it's, it's,
[00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:41.040]   I mean, it's curious, right?
[00:50:41.040 --> 00:50:46.040]   It's also painful because, you know, Brianna, you mentioned like, you know, the CPMs dropping
[00:50:46.040 --> 00:50:47.040]   through the floor.
[00:50:47.040 --> 00:50:49.840]   And last time I saw it, I think TikTok is playing like what?
[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:56.000]   Two to four cents, you know, per every thousand views, like a two cents CPM, a four cents CPM,
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.160]   if you're part of the TikTok creator fund.
[00:50:58.160 --> 00:51:03.920]   And so, you know, yeah, and so a lot of people are like, okay, I, I'm going to class this
[00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:08.440]   very broadnet using YouTube, TikTok, anything else I can use.
[00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:12.680]   And then I will try to feed them towards some platform where I can actually generate revenue,
[00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:18.120]   whether it's t-shirt sales, Patreon, you know, my crafts, whatever it is.
[00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:21.880]   And it's been really curious to watch how this has evolved over the last few years or
[00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:22.880]   the last couple of years.
[00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:24.880]   So I'm liking this idea.
[00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:29.760]   I'm going to start my Porsche at TikTok with my Porsche collection and we'll go out there.
[00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:32.480]   I mean, that's all you need is stuff, like stuff to shoot.
[00:51:32.480 --> 00:51:35.880]   And you've got a lot of cool stuff, Briana, like just looking at your Twitter feed, like
[00:51:35.880 --> 00:51:39.000]   you've got so many toys and so many cool things going on in your house that I'm sure
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:40.480]   people would be into it.
[00:51:40.480 --> 00:51:41.480]   You know what?
[00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:43.920]   While we're talking about TikTok, like there, there were a couple of stories that we saw
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:47.360]   come across the feeds this week.
[00:51:47.360 --> 00:51:52.160]   There was a report that nearly half of Gen Z is using TikTok and Instagram for search instead
[00:51:52.160 --> 00:51:53.160]   of Google.
[00:51:53.160 --> 00:51:55.440]   They're just searching for videos.
[00:51:55.440 --> 00:51:58.400]   Well, I'm not surprised at all about that.
[00:51:58.400 --> 00:51:59.400]   According to Google's own data.
[00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:04.120]   Yeah, this is just like how Facebook was the internet or is the internet for certain parts
[00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:05.120]   of the world.
[00:52:05.120 --> 00:52:11.200]   They don't see beyond the confines of what people are posting and linking.
[00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:14.200]   And I'm not surprised about that at all.
[00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:19.680]   And I think it speaks to when you say we talk about established publications or internet
[00:52:19.680 --> 00:52:26.400]   olds like us afraid of moving to platform, there was just VidCon last month and it was
[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:28.760]   all TikTok sponsored and TikTok focused.
[00:52:28.760 --> 00:52:33.640]   And you had outlets like Washington Post talking about how they curate and create their content
[00:52:33.640 --> 00:52:35.080]   specifically for the platform.
[00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:40.840]   It's all very familiar about it feels like 10 years ago when everyone was afraid to get
[00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:44.200]   on a site like Twitter and now it's just normal.
[00:52:44.200 --> 00:52:45.120]   Amazing.
[00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:48.240]   So this is a business inside article, right?
[00:52:48.240 --> 00:52:52.400]   They say 40% of Gen Z for searching on TikTok and Instagram.
[00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:58.600]   And part of that's because if 90% of your time online is spent in TikTok or Instagram,
[00:52:58.600 --> 00:53:02.280]   you just search inside of Instagram or TikTok, right?
[00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:06.760]   And I will be honest with you, if you're searching in certain subjects, it feels like
[00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:11.720]   the results you get on Google have gotten worse and worse and worse over the last couple
[00:53:11.720 --> 00:53:12.840]   of years, especially, right?
[00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:16.920]   Because the Wirecutter laid out this model where, you know, right, I search a lot for
[00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:19.480]   stuff in technology around technology.
[00:53:19.480 --> 00:53:24.040]   And there's some third parties that have come up for tools to sort of, they seem to
[00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:30.600]   sort of scrape Amazon and create this word salad that becomes, you know, the top 10
[00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:33.000]   projectors you want to buy this summer.
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:38.760]   And you know, and so places that have SEO and revenue challenges are suddenly becoming,
[00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:42.040]   you know, our experts have picked the top 10 projectors you want to buy this summer.
[00:53:42.040 --> 00:53:45.840]   And it's like Rolling Stone and like, nothing against Rolling Stone, but I'm really not
[00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:50.200]   looking at them to tell me that I need a, you know, like their third result was like
[00:53:50.200 --> 00:53:58.600]   a $200, 720p, you know, AA battery powered projector that could light up a 200 inch screen, right?
[00:53:58.600 --> 00:54:03.080]   And it's like, all of this is, this is, this is false all the way down, right?
[00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:07.400]   And it's, you know, and I'm looking at them like they literally are scraping all these
[00:54:07.400 --> 00:54:12.520]   different, like, you know, the lies from the vendor, the questionable reviews that are showing
[00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:17.560]   up that may or may not be, you know, advertorial and creating a guide.
[00:54:17.560 --> 00:54:20.600]   You're getting so much of this in your Google results.
[00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:25.240]   I can also see people like, I just want to see really printed pictures of whatever.
[00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:27.160]   And they go to Instagram and they just search straight.
[00:54:27.160 --> 00:54:30.360]   It's like the people you know who, who don't really have the internet.
[00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:32.200]   They have Pinterest.
[00:54:32.200 --> 00:54:34.840]   And I have nothing against Pinterest except that I don't want to log in there.
[00:54:34.840 --> 00:54:36.120]   I don't want to spend a lot of time there.
[00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:37.960]   I don't want to deal with their interface.
[00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:43.160]   But boy, you know, if you're searching for certain kind of home goods or paint colors for your house,
[00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:46.040]   man Pinterest is going to be filling your Google results.
[00:54:46.040 --> 00:54:49.880]   So I can totally see why there's probably a whole category of genuine whatever that,
[00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:53.480]   you know, does 40% of searching in Pinterest, right?
[00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:58.040]   You know, it's it gets even, it gets even wilder because there's another report from TechRunch.
[00:54:58.040 --> 00:55:01.240]   Kids and Teens are now spending more time watching TikTok than YouTube,
[00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:05.480]   which has been true since 2020, June 2020.
[00:55:05.480 --> 00:55:05.880]   Oh, no.
[00:55:05.880 --> 00:55:06.360]   Apparently.
[00:55:06.360 --> 00:55:11.880]   So according to data compiled by the parental control software maker, custodio.
[00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:16.440]   Let's see here by the end of 2021 kids and teens were watching an average of
[00:55:16.440 --> 00:55:20.840]   91 minutes of TikTok per day compared with just 56 minutes watching YouTube.
[00:55:20.840 --> 00:55:23.240]   So that's just according to custodios platform.
[00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:25.560]   But still that is wow.
[00:55:25.560 --> 00:55:28.040]   That's something that is crazy.
[00:55:28.040 --> 00:55:32.120]   I'm just I'm trying to think through like getting through my professional day
[00:55:32.120 --> 00:55:34.360]   and having to Google stuff on TikTok.
[00:55:34.360 --> 00:55:38.600]   Like imagine like stack overflow, but it's TikTok.
[00:55:38.600 --> 00:55:43.480]   Like having memory flow issues need to get the garbage collection to come.
[00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:46.520]   Yeah, there's some unreal engineer to it.
[00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:48.520]   To explain it.
[00:55:48.520 --> 00:55:50.200]   I like this.
[00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:52.280]   Everything should be TikTok from here on out.
[00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:54.760]   Everything, everything should be TikTok.
[00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:56.120]   So maybe that is the future of media.
[00:55:56.120 --> 00:55:56.600]   I don't know.
[00:55:56.600 --> 00:56:01.560]   According to my daughter, it is because it's the app she demands like right before bedtime.
[00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:04.840]   So right before bath time and actual story time with physical books,
[00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:09.960]   she eats a little snack and we watch just like 10 minutes of TikToks is one of her
[00:56:09.960 --> 00:56:11.240]   favorite things to do every night.
[00:56:11.240 --> 00:56:14.760]   And just to see her being raised on it and my complicity in that,
[00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:16.680]   I'm working through that guys.
[00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:20.760]   There was TikTok actually rolled out some features.
[00:56:20.760 --> 00:56:21.080]   Go ahead.
[00:56:21.080 --> 00:56:24.200]   No, no, I was just going to say, don't you think though?
[00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:28.600]   I mean, I'm thinking like my habit as an adult of like,
[00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:33.160]   in today's Sunday, Sunday's the day you said to read the New York Times Sunday edition, right?
[00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:40.040]   Like as you get older, your desire for more sophisticated like experiences,
[00:56:40.040 --> 00:56:41.560]   I mean, I'm not saying this to me, me.
[00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:44.760]   I'm saying like, I'm thinking when I was your daughter's age,
[00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:47.080]   like I read a lot of Calvin Hobbes books.
[00:56:47.080 --> 00:56:53.720]   As I said, I don't enjoy those today, but you know, your brain grows and you're in for
[00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:55.560]   more sophisticated content.
[00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:57.400]   So I don't know.
[00:56:57.400 --> 00:56:58.360]   Calvin Hobbes could.
[00:56:58.360 --> 00:56:59.240]   The idea.
[00:56:59.240 --> 00:56:59.720]   Yeah.
[00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:00.280]   Yeah.
[00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:04.360]   A lot of the problems of our world right now could probably be solved with Calvin and Hobbes
[00:57:04.360 --> 00:57:04.920]   philosophy.
[00:57:04.920 --> 00:57:05.720]   You're right there.
[00:57:05.720 --> 00:57:06.520]   You're right there.
[00:57:06.520 --> 00:57:09.880]   I mean, talking about what's sophisticated and what's not.
[00:57:09.880 --> 00:57:15.720]   I want to call it a quick feature that is that is also going to start rolling out on TikTok,
[00:57:15.720 --> 00:57:20.040]   content filters, and maturity ratings in a pledge to make the app safer.
[00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:25.320]   And that is one thing I noticed is that it is, you can go into like restricted mode,
[00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:27.880]   which I try to do when I'm like going through feeds with my daughter.
[00:57:27.880 --> 00:57:29.480]   And she's three and a half years old.
[00:57:29.480 --> 00:57:33.720]   So there is like really excessive stuff on TikTok.
[00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:36.920]   There's scary things or like scary little short videos.
[00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:39.320]   There's a lot of swearing and violence at times too.
[00:57:39.320 --> 00:57:43.240]   And it's really hard to control against that.
[00:57:43.240 --> 00:57:46.360]   So even with the restricted mode, we still get swearing.
[00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:49.720]   We still get some like creepy videos that I don't want her to see before bedtime.
[00:57:49.720 --> 00:57:52.520]   So hey, more controls for all this content.
[00:57:52.520 --> 00:57:56.200]   I think that's something everybody will want.
[00:57:56.920 --> 00:58:00.280]   So yeah, maybe your TikToks are going to get a little, your TikTok experience is going to get a
[00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:04.280]   little cleaner. Maybe we'll get more ways to watch them on bigger screens too.
[00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:07.240]   I think what is it? Samsung TVs or LG?
[00:58:07.240 --> 00:58:10.280]   Well, like one of the companies has rolled out a TikTok app.
[00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:12.120]   Maybe that is something we'll start to see more of too.
[00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:14.840]   Because it's going to look awful on a wide screen TV.
[00:58:14.840 --> 00:58:18.680]   But at the same time, it's really hard to share TikToks.
[00:58:18.680 --> 00:58:21.080]   If it's not just me and my daughter, you know, if my wife wants to join in,
[00:58:21.080 --> 00:58:22.920]   then we all have to like crowd around the phone.
[00:58:22.920 --> 00:58:26.520]   So after a certain point, I don't know, that's going to start hurting.
[00:58:26.520 --> 00:58:32.040]   That platform. But yeah, somebody on the chat, by the way, I lost your name.
[00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:38.200]   But somebody pointed out that Twitter killed Vine and Vine was basically proto-TikTok.
[00:58:38.200 --> 00:58:43.320]   So it also kind of shows you that the bad decision-making has been going on for so long
[00:58:43.320 --> 00:58:48.840]   over at Twitter. Imagine if Vine was allowed to flourish and grow into, you know, an actual
[00:58:48.840 --> 00:58:55.480]   forest of content. It could have, it could have like, yeah, been a bigger thing before TikTok ever
[00:58:55.480 --> 00:59:01.880]   ever actually succeeded. So yeah. Any other thoughts on TikTok and what you guys are
[00:59:01.880 --> 00:59:06.680]   enjoying on the TikToks? Like Patrick, I'm glad you're liking the DIY stuff and the really
[00:59:06.680 --> 00:59:10.760]   technical stuff. My daughter loves watching people build things. There's a guy who builds
[00:59:10.760 --> 00:59:14.760]   fountains in China. And every TikTok is just like two minutes of him just like,
[00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:17.800]   laying out the brick, put it, put it down, everything, put it down this meant. And like,
[00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:20.200]   she loves it. She just watches them over and over again.
[00:59:20.200 --> 00:59:25.080]   What would you, yeah, what are you watching, Patrick?
[00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:26.600]   It sounds like you have a lot of fun things.
[00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:33.080]   For me, I know it's funny, right? Because for you, for you, my boys.
[00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:40.840]   For me, it's been interesting because on one hand, right, you know, Brianna, I have a major in
[00:59:40.840 --> 00:59:45.560]   literature. I love to read books. I read a lot of novels, but in certain areas, part of me really
[00:59:45.560 --> 00:59:51.160]   enjoys sophisticated television. Part of me just wants to tune out. It's been fascinating.
[00:59:52.040 --> 00:59:56.120]   It doesn't show up so much on TikTok, but on YouTube, there's amazing maker videos
[00:59:56.120 --> 00:59:59.960]   and watching people do the technique at close range and figuring out how they're using tools,
[00:59:59.960 --> 01:00:05.000]   especially for sculpting and modeling. With TikTok, the quality varies immensely.
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:12.600]   Not so much in the quality of the video, but the actual like, sometimes you get like,
[01:00:12.600 --> 01:00:18.040]   I'm Bob and I'm building a retaining wall. And you're like, oh, Bob didn't put down any gravel
[01:00:18.040 --> 01:00:21.800]   and you didn't tamp it. There's no drainage and that retaining wall is going to tip over and
[01:00:21.800 --> 01:00:26.840]   collapse on his really cool car. And in other cases, you actually have professionals that are
[01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:31.960]   seasoned or it's, like I said, a lot of the stuff that's fascinating for me is watching people who
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:37.800]   are trained professionals showing off what they do and how they do it. And in other cases, you know,
[01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:43.560]   it's really fascinating watching kettle ball exercises. And then I hear from a friend of mine who
[01:00:43.560 --> 01:00:46.840]   is a certified business instructor like, yeah, you got to be really careful who you follow because
[01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:49.560]   some of those people have no idea what they're doing and you're going to rip your hamstrings loose
[01:00:49.560 --> 01:00:54.680]   from your body. And I was just like, oh, okay, this just went for being an amusing entertainment
[01:00:54.680 --> 01:01:00.280]   too. I'm going to end up in occupational therapy. And I don't know if I like that concept. So,
[01:01:00.280 --> 01:01:05.400]   it's hard, right? I'm mostly right. I'm just happy my kids aren't on TikTok. And I don't have to
[01:01:05.400 --> 01:01:10.760]   figure out the whole safety resources for teens because apparently no one under a few years looks
[01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:16.600]   at TikTok, right? It's hard. Hopefully these safety tools will be a big help, Patrick. But
[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:21.160]   yeah, thank you for sharing what you're digging there. We've got some other news. I want to talk
[01:01:21.160 --> 01:01:26.040]   about the uber file soon. But you know what? It's time for another word from Leo and with a word
[01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:33.800]   from our sponsors. I got to tell you, every time, you know, in the past I've gone on a cruise, it's
[01:01:33.800 --> 01:01:39.560]   been eat, eat, eat, gain, gain, gain. This time is going to be very different because Lisa and I
[01:01:40.440 --> 01:01:47.880]   use noom weight and we love it. When we decided lose weight, it's usually not just about the number
[01:01:47.880 --> 01:01:53.000]   on the scale. You want to lose weight for health, for looks for a variety of reasons. Whatever your
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:58.920]   reason is, noom weight is there to help you. It's not a diet. Don't confuse it with a diet.
[01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:05.400]   Noom weights a psychology first approach that empowers you to build more sustainable habits by
[01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:12.200]   helping you understand why you eat, why you have the behaviors you have so that you can be in charge
[01:02:12.200 --> 01:02:17.800]   of what you're doing. I, for instance, am a fog eater. I don't even notice that I'm eating.
[01:02:17.800 --> 01:02:22.200]   And noom taught me to slow down, to enjoy every bite, to turn off the phone and the TV,
[01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:26.360]   stop looking at the newspaper, really do enjoy what I'm eating. And it made a huge
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:31.000]   difference. But everybody's differently says a different model. In fact, it was really, really
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:36.680]   cool because I started doing noom more than a year ago. And Lisa said, I'm going to help you.
[01:02:36.680 --> 01:02:40.440]   She doesn't need to lose much weight. She's, she looks great. But she said, I'm going to help you.
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:47.000]   I'm going to go on noon too. She loves it. She did in fact lose about 10 pounds. Looks better than
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:54.040]   ever. Noom weight has helped more than 3.6 million people lose weight. And just like me and Lisa,
[01:02:54.040 --> 01:02:59.880]   every journey is different. Her lessons are different than mine. Your personalized lessons,
[01:03:00.520 --> 01:03:04.200]   depending on your goal, the amount of time you want to spend with the lessons is based on
[01:03:04.200 --> 01:03:09.720]   scientific principles like cognitive behavioral therapy, CBT. It really works.
[01:03:09.720 --> 01:03:17.240]   It's kind of profound. And there is no bad food in Newman. And I love this because it isn't a diet.
[01:03:17.240 --> 01:03:21.800]   I remember the first time I, I thought I fell off the wagon. You know, I ate a hot dog and I,
[01:03:21.800 --> 01:03:25.400]   you get a personal coach, which is nice as well as a group. And I went to the coach and I said,
[01:03:25.400 --> 01:03:29.000]   I ate a hot dog. And she said, yeah, so I said, well, that's bad. Right. She said,
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:34.840]   there are no bad foods. There are no bad foods. They don't believe in restricting what you eat.
[01:03:34.840 --> 01:03:41.480]   Whatever your health goals are, the flexible non restrictive program focuses on progress,
[01:03:41.480 --> 01:03:46.360]   not perfection. And one of the things I learned from Newman is you can't feel deprived. You won't,
[01:03:46.360 --> 01:03:52.120]   it won't work if you feel like I'm giving things up. You don't with noom. You could choose your
[01:03:52.120 --> 01:03:56.600]   level of support from five minute daily check ins to personal coaching. You get to choose.
[01:03:56.600 --> 01:04:01.720]   I love my coach. Lisa loves her coach too. Progress is in a straight line and off days,
[01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:07.960]   totally fine. Noom weight helps you get back on track with gentle support or whatever you need,
[01:04:07.960 --> 01:04:12.200]   the kind of support you need. And by the way, this is totally grounded in science, active
[01:04:12.200 --> 01:04:19.160]   numerous lose an average of 15 pounds and 16 weeks. I lost more than that. 95% of customers say
[01:04:19.160 --> 01:04:23.240]   noom weight is a good long term solution. I'll vouch for that. And I can tell you when I come
[01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:30.440]   back from the cruise, you'll see it works. Because it's going to be easy. I'm really thrilled
[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:36.040]   about having noom to back me up on this trip. 30 peer reviewed scientific articles published by
[01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:41.400]   Noom to inform users, practitioners, scientists in the public about how they do it and what the
[01:04:41.400 --> 01:04:45.880]   effectiveness is. So they have the science to show that it really works. And I'll tell you what,
[01:04:45.880 --> 01:04:50.920]   I know it really works because it does for me and it does for Lisa. Stay focused on what's
[01:04:50.920 --> 01:04:55.400]   important to you. You've probably heard about noom. You've seen their TV ads. Just take it for me.
[01:04:55.400 --> 01:05:01.800]   I've used it for more than a year. It really is amazing. It transforms your relationship with food
[01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:07.400]   in a positive way. You don't feel deprived. Feel really good, really healthy. Noom weights,
[01:05:07.400 --> 01:05:12.440]   psychology based approach really works. Sign up for your trial today. Noom is N O O M.
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:20.840]   So go to noom.com/twit N O O M. Noom.com/twit. Sign up for your trial today. You've probably
[01:05:20.840 --> 01:05:24.680]   been thinking about it. That's what happened with me. I saw about five ads on the TV and I said,
[01:05:24.680 --> 01:05:32.280]   yeah, I probably should try this. And wow, I've been in every diet in the world. This is the last
[01:05:32.280 --> 01:05:37.560]   one. It really, really works. Oh, it's not a diet, but you know what I mean. All right. Now back
[01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:41.800]   to the show, I've got to get to the buffet. Thanks, Leo. I hope you're having fun on the
[01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:47.560]   cruise. Be careful with that buffet bar. This week, we learned about the Uber files, which is a
[01:05:47.560 --> 01:05:55.080]   trove of 124,000 documents, company files delivered to the Guardian and it was shared to a lot of
[01:05:55.080 --> 01:06:00.440]   media organizations around the world. And it was also revealed that Mark McGahn, a career lobbyist
[01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:05.160]   who led Uber's efforts to win over governments in Europe, the Middle East and Africa, has come
[01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:09.320]   forward to identify himself at the source of that. I'm reading from the Guardian here. The Uber
[01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:15.400]   paper is basically show that especially early on for the past decade, basically,
[01:06:15.400 --> 01:06:20.760]   Uber was a relentless company when it came to growing and expanding to different territories.
[01:06:20.760 --> 01:06:28.440]   They would basically ignore local laws and do all sorts of tricks to really just get themselves
[01:06:28.440 --> 01:06:34.200]   up and running in these countries. I was kind of heads down on reviews and stuff this week,
[01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:39.160]   so I didn't really see this news blow up. But also, I kind of felt like we probably knew a lot
[01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:43.880]   of this stuff too. As Uber was growing, I was there, reporting on Uber and other companies.
[01:06:43.880 --> 01:06:49.160]   A lot of people were talking about how this company was just flouting local laws and really just
[01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:56.280]   kind of bling its way into the marketplace. Brianna, I'm sure you're somebody who's looking at this
[01:06:56.280 --> 01:07:03.400]   from the political side of things. Did you have a response to the Uber files? Or was it just the
[01:07:03.400 --> 01:07:09.000]   stuff you assumed they were doing all along? No, it's certainly not what I'm assuming they were doing.
[01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:17.560]   All along. There's a pattern in the tech industry. We saw this with Facebook. We see it with Twitter.
[01:07:17.560 --> 01:07:23.240]   We see it with all these large companies. I'm not upset anyone here, but I'm going to tell you
[01:07:23.240 --> 01:07:31.000]   what I really think is when you build institutions and you have sexist hiring practices and women
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:38.200]   are not involved from the beginning. You have products that are dangerous to everyone.
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:44.920]   There's not a very specific kind of person. You know what I'm talking about there. It is not a
[01:07:44.920 --> 01:07:52.600]   surprise to me at all that I read SuperPumpch. I mean, I saw the mini series that the same
[01:07:52.600 --> 01:08:02.760]   guy that promotes this frat boy atmosphere to this company did not take safety seriously.
[01:08:02.760 --> 01:08:08.040]   Look at the bottom line here. We're talking about not really doing background checks on drivers.
[01:08:08.040 --> 01:08:14.920]   We're talking about trying to wipe this, sweep this under the rug when women are sexually assaulted
[01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:22.440]   or raped or kidnapped in an Uber. It's exactly like the succession plot line where they're just
[01:08:22.440 --> 01:08:29.160]   trying to hide it here. This is a pattern in the tech industry of building these tools that are
[01:08:29.160 --> 01:08:37.160]   just flat out dangerous. I have to say this, this is my honest opinion. I have spoken up.
[01:08:37.160 --> 01:08:42.600]   I have run for office. I've back-channelled with these companies trying to get them to make better
[01:08:42.600 --> 01:08:50.520]   policy. I've really almost come to the conclusion that until it is more expensive to do the wrong
[01:08:50.520 --> 01:08:58.280]   thing than the right thing, we're going to have this kind of destroying machine just continue to
[01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:05.400]   exist hurting people. I am cheerleading the women involved in this lawsuit. I hope they make it
[01:09:05.400 --> 01:09:11.880]   so expensive for Uber to behave this way that they will do the right thing and will do real
[01:09:11.880 --> 01:09:17.480]   background checks and will put cameras in cars, which by the way would help drivers too. There
[01:09:17.480 --> 01:09:23.000]   are plenty of drivers that get abused by bad passengers and do the hard work that they clearly
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:28.760]   don't want to do. You're referencing a separate story to Brown. There is a story about Uber facing
[01:09:28.760 --> 01:09:34.920]   a lawsuit by women for sexual or further sexual assault claims. It's a group of over 500 women.
[01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:41.320]   We're waiting to see what happens with all that stuff too. To what you're saying,
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:47.080]   it does the thing that kept ringing true to me is that I've been covering startups since
[01:09:47.080 --> 01:09:57.160]   2009. Since I officially started working for tech journalism sites. The thing I kept seeing
[01:09:57.160 --> 01:10:05.240]   over and over again, it is growth at all costs. It's also these huge VCs. It's the VC firms pushing
[01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:12.680]   these personalities to grow as much as possible. A lot of them were really into the bad boy
[01:10:12.680 --> 01:10:21.560]   entrepreneur idea. That's what Travis Kalenek, a Uber founder, represented. At the end of the day,
[01:10:21.560 --> 01:10:28.440]   it is the VCs pushing these guys to scale and do whatever it takes to get there. This is the
[01:10:28.440 --> 01:10:33.320]   Silicon Valley problem in a nutshell. Everything that's happened here we're seeing from the Uber files.
[01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:40.920]   Also specifically in the type of business, in this business model where it's red sharing,
[01:10:40.920 --> 01:10:51.320]   where their workforce are not their employees, they're relying on a system of people who are
[01:10:51.320 --> 01:11:02.600]   they have no interest in helping the company. Both their customers and their drivers are
[01:11:03.400 --> 01:11:11.480]   there's no loyalty, there's no incentives except for money. That's not a good business.
[01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:14.920]   They're struggling right now because of that. It's not very sustainable.
[01:11:14.920 --> 01:11:25.640]   I mean, Uber seems to be so messy in so many different levels. The thing it was fascinating
[01:11:25.640 --> 01:11:32.440]   was watching all the money that was being spent on Prop 22 in California. It was like Uber 52
[01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:42.120]   million, Lyft 49 million. It was just a member thing like this is not a very nice law. This incredibly
[01:11:42.120 --> 01:11:47.560]   asterisk or a situation. I've known several people who have sort of cycled in and out of Uber.
[01:11:47.560 --> 01:11:52.360]   I don't think I've run into any of them that were like, "Gosh, this is a great company trying to do
[01:11:52.360 --> 01:12:05.400]   things." This is just, there are some people making a living on Uber. There are some people that cover
[01:12:05.400 --> 01:12:12.520]   Uber where they're describing what I can only euphemize as financial shenanigans they do and the
[01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:21.960]   one who report things and how the continuing sort of saga of Uber. I don't know. It's part of the
[01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:30.120]   culture of VC is like, "Okay, we want a 100 to 1 return on our investment and everybody has to
[01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:37.240]   be unicorn and no business can be reasonably sized. It has to be huge because apparently so much of
[01:12:37.240 --> 01:12:43.560]   the venture capital world is run like a 1970s record label where it's like, "We're going to throw
[01:12:43.560 --> 01:12:47.960]   11 things against the wall and one of them is going to give us that hit we need to pay for the
[01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:56.440]   other 10 bad decisions we made." This is, I don't know. I don't see any, I don't know how Uber ends up
[01:12:56.440 --> 01:13:07.400]   going anywhere positive. Maybe that's just, it's nice to be able to get an Uber in places where
[01:13:07.400 --> 01:13:13.160]   you used to not be able to get a cab, but even that's become a failing thing in terms of the
[01:13:13.160 --> 01:13:21.160]   availability of rides or the functioning of the system. I'm a 5 foot 10, 240 pound guy who played
[01:13:21.160 --> 01:13:27.240]   rugby with a 17 and a half inch neck. I generally don't get threatened in Uber's. I did have a
[01:13:27.240 --> 01:13:31.720]   cab driver once when I tapped on his window in New York City in the battle days, pull out of 38
[01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:39.960]   because he didn't realize he was sleeping, which was memorable, highly unusual. I don't think they've
[01:13:39.960 --> 01:13:45.800]   taken anybody's safety seriously. It's always one of the things where it takes all of its horrible
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:50.760]   press and then they give an inch and all of this horrible press and then they give another quarter
[01:13:50.760 --> 01:13:56.360]   of an inch and it's frustrating. It's frustrating what they're doing to the drivers. It's frustrating
[01:13:56.360 --> 01:14:03.080]   in the gamification of the system. If you've ever sat in an Uber where somebody has Uber going and
[01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:07.000]   Lyft going simultaneously and they're flipping back and forth between the two trying to figure out
[01:14:07.000 --> 01:14:15.000]   how to make a living, I don't think anybody wins. It would be nice to see places being punished
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:22.040]   for making bad decisions that hurt everyone. I think, gosh, think about how all the changes
[01:14:22.040 --> 01:14:25.960]   that were made in the financial community after the financial markets crashed in 2008
[01:14:25.960 --> 01:14:34.840]   and then I get really sad and I stop thinking. They really paid a price there. It's frustrating.
[01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:39.960]   Well, it's even more frustrating that even if there are consequences and we're all talking about
[01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:46.200]   wanting consequences, whether it's for Elon, his whims, more billionaires, or poorly run
[01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:52.440]   companies, to get to that point, people suffer, to hit the point to push to the brink where there
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:59.240]   are either economic or political consequences, real people suffer in the real world and that's not a
[01:14:59.240 --> 01:15:07.480]   workable system either. I just think my message here is it's more limited than a boil the ocean.
[01:15:07.480 --> 01:15:13.320]   Let's make it so VCs are nicer kinder people that build better companies. I have a very specific
[01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:20.440]   action item here, which is the congenital sexism problem in tech where I would remind you,
[01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:28.360]   women leave tech careers at a rate of four times that of men. It is brutal. It's really bad.
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:33.720]   You know, that has consequences. You're not just talking about a woman that's not going to
[01:15:33.720 --> 01:15:40.760]   get her shot to be CEO of a company or make it up the career ladder. You're talking about the
[01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:48.040]   outcome of that of a company like Uber, which is serving as public transportation all across
[01:15:48.040 --> 01:15:55.640]   the world in a lot of ways leading to these outcomes of kidnappings, rape, sexual assault.
[01:15:55.640 --> 01:16:02.040]   And I can tell you it's a very, there's a very specific kind of fear that I think a lot of guys
[01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:07.880]   just are fortunate to not have to think about when you're in an Uber and like the guy starts
[01:16:07.880 --> 01:16:13.240]   flirting with you or something, right? Like you're instantly on guard. You're instantly worried.
[01:16:13.240 --> 01:16:20.120]   Is he driving me where I think I want to go? Like am I, it's just a whole set of things that's very,
[01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:27.800]   very important. So my message here is, you know, tech, if you have women involved in the decision
[01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:33.160]   loop on these things, I think you would have problems like safety and cameras and things
[01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:38.920]   like that taken far more seriously. And that's why I would continue to advocate in the tech industry.
[01:16:38.920 --> 01:16:43.560]   Thank you. Thank you for that, Brianna. And I agree, the safety thing is something
[01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:47.320]   that you need to work on. But the other thing we haven't really mentioned here is just like
[01:16:47.320 --> 01:16:52.840]   their strategies for kind of a flourishing, you know, spreading across the world.
[01:16:52.840 --> 01:16:58.440]   I don't know. It was like a thousand years ago. But if you remember the early 2010s, when we had
[01:16:58.440 --> 01:17:04.440]   these, the war of the cab apps in New York, there were several going on, including like one of the
[01:17:04.440 --> 01:17:10.280]   first ones that Uber did not discover this technology of like, you know, GPS assisted cab
[01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:15.320]   location. There was a company called Halo, which I believe was an Israeli company that was also
[01:17:15.320 --> 01:17:19.800]   trying to launch in New York at the same time. There were a bunch of these companies. And
[01:17:19.800 --> 01:17:24.760]   from my reporting back then, and just from what I can remember, it really came down to Uber just
[01:17:24.760 --> 01:17:32.040]   bullying these companies, you know, out of every single city. I remember one day, I think Halo was
[01:17:32.040 --> 01:17:40.200]   celebrating it. And that was spelled H-I-L-O-H-A-I-L-O. They were celebrating like, you know, their
[01:17:40.200 --> 01:17:44.840]   launch in New York. And they were popping champagne. I walked into their offices because they were
[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:49.400]   next door to our co-working space. So that was convenient. But there was also news that came
[01:17:49.400 --> 01:17:55.320]   down immediately that a judge halted their service. So I don't know. I don't even recall why that
[01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:59.640]   was happening. But a lot of companies had trouble starting, especially in a city like New York.
[01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:03.800]   New York was also special for Uber because it wasn't anybody that could just ride it, right? You
[01:18:03.800 --> 01:18:09.080]   had to have, I believe, a cab license. So New York, very little better than others. Yeah, I'm a
[01:18:09.080 --> 01:18:17.240]   medallion. It was just seeing these companies. And we're seeing the long-term effects of these
[01:18:17.240 --> 01:18:22.040]   companies just kind of taking over the world. And nobody really stopping them. And a lot of people
[01:18:22.040 --> 01:18:27.800]   criticizing them along the way. But I don't know. Like every time I'm here on Twitch, like I talk
[01:18:27.800 --> 01:18:31.960]   about like, we need better regulations for companies like Facebook and the way they're like
[01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:35.800]   intersecting with our lives. When a company like Uber is just doing the stuff, you know,
[01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:39.720]   broadly across the entire world, I don't know what are the actions other than the entire
[01:18:39.720 --> 01:18:45.480]   several countries getting together to kind of act together and fix that with their own
[01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:49.240]   regulation. But it's tough to get countries to do anything together. I don't know.
[01:18:49.240 --> 01:18:54.360]   Have you guys-- What did the answer here is sue them in civil court? I mean, that's
[01:18:54.360 --> 01:18:58.040]   the only story. At least what the women are talking about, make it very expensive to make
[01:18:58.040 --> 01:19:03.800]   these decisions. That's what I would advocate. For sure. It's just like the competing companies.
[01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:08.360]   The other-- There were a lot of stories about the dirty tricks they would do. Like basically call--
[01:19:08.360 --> 01:19:13.800]   I think it was it call lift rides and cancel them. There were all sort of weird dirty tracks
[01:19:13.800 --> 01:19:16.680]   that they were doing. And I don't know how much of it just comes down to like,
[01:19:16.680 --> 01:19:21.960]   is anybody-- Is any of the blame on the VCs who are pumping these companies up and basically
[01:19:21.960 --> 01:19:28.760]   giving them the money to go bribe or lean on political allies across the world?
[01:19:28.760 --> 01:19:33.480]   Do the VCs have any responsibility for this? I don't know if we've ever really asked those
[01:19:33.480 --> 01:19:41.800]   questions. I don't do enough business reporting to tell there. But do you think VCs deserve to be
[01:19:41.800 --> 01:19:48.280]   have the fire under them a little more when they're pushing companies to grow and scale like Uber is?
[01:19:48.280 --> 01:19:55.960]   I think certainly the board positions. I mean, I can tell you I run a non-profit.
[01:19:55.960 --> 01:20:02.360]   I spend an ordinary amount of time talking on FEC regulation and things like that. And if you're
[01:20:02.360 --> 01:20:08.440]   on the board, you do have certain fiduciary duties, right? For oversight and things like that.
[01:20:08.440 --> 01:20:14.040]   I think with these dirty tricks, like my first thought is, where are the regulators? Where are
[01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:21.000]   the people that see these things coming to light that then are knocking on the door of the board
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:28.280]   and saying, look, you have a legal responsibility to do due diligence here. How did you not know
[01:20:28.280 --> 01:20:33.960]   about this? I think bringing civil and maybe even criminal charges in certain positions,
[01:20:33.960 --> 01:20:42.200]   I think that's the way to go. I think overall in this country, not to be American centric,
[01:20:42.200 --> 01:20:48.440]   but we've gotten far too lax at prosecuting white collar crime. And I think that's something
[01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:54.040]   all across the board, Republicans and Democrats would love to see more of that. So I would love
[01:20:54.040 --> 01:21:01.320]   to see our local prosecutors to worry a little less about marijuana convictions and prosecuting
[01:21:01.320 --> 01:21:06.680]   those cases. Let's go out to fraud. Let's go out to corporate America some more. We're all
[01:21:06.680 --> 01:21:13.160]   on board with that, baby. Let's do it. I feel like that is what a lot of citizens want. And I don't
[01:21:13.160 --> 01:21:18.200]   know if this country is able to hear that sometimes. So I know how I mean, Breonna, you're working in a
[01:21:18.200 --> 01:21:23.560]   progressive pack right now, right? So it is you're advocating for a lot of what people want. But
[01:21:23.560 --> 01:21:28.360]   I keep looking back and thinking like, Oh man, these companies, you brought up the financial crisis,
[01:21:28.360 --> 01:21:33.960]   Patrick. Yeah, they really paid the price. The airlines. Yeah.
[01:21:33.960 --> 01:21:41.880]   No, there's a lot of things. Yeah. It's not funny at all, but I'm looking at this list of
[01:21:41.880 --> 01:21:48.440]   uber funding rounds. And several years in, it was obvious that this was a company that was
[01:21:49.320 --> 01:21:55.880]   really aggressive. I'll put it that way. And you look at it, it's like, well, you know what I mean?
[01:21:55.880 --> 01:22:04.280]   Like, it's you know, 2.8 billion, 3.5 billion in 2016, and you know, like 1.8 billion.
[01:22:04.280 --> 01:22:13.000]   Obviously, 7.7 billion, I think in one secondary round in 2017. And this is staggering amounts
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:22.280]   of money, right? For especially when you kind of think like going back to the days of, of, you know,
[01:22:22.280 --> 01:22:29.640]   well, brick and mortar is dead. And we're going to take over and we lose money on every bag of dog
[01:22:29.640 --> 01:22:34.120]   food we ship, but we're going to make it up in volume. And just being like, you know, you look
[01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:42.040]   at the logic of the money, and there is no gateway. And you know, it would be nice if the people that
[01:22:42.040 --> 01:22:47.320]   are hurling money at these companies would actually be like, yes, we would like you to have some
[01:22:47.320 --> 01:22:52.520]   women in senior management positions. More importantly, we would like you to listen to what they are
[01:22:52.520 --> 01:22:59.080]   asking for in the process of creating this project or this product. And we would like you to behave
[01:22:59.080 --> 01:23:04.040]   because the other thing that you run into so often all over the business spectrum is,
[01:23:04.040 --> 01:23:10.280]   do it. We'll ask forgiveness later. Do it. We'll throw the lawyers at it. Because, you know,
[01:23:10.280 --> 01:23:18.280]   nobody really pays the price for a lot of this stuff. It's messy. And it doesn't seem to be getting
[01:23:18.280 --> 01:23:26.360]   a lot better. It is for me, like, this is another story of like the the growth all costs and doesn't
[01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:30.440]   really matter what the consequences of your actions are. So I'm glad the uber files are out there.
[01:23:30.440 --> 01:23:36.440]   Hopefully we'll start to see more reporting out of them. And Uber has not they have basically kept
[01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:42.440]   saying I believe like when the new uber CEO came on and Kalnik was ousted, they're saying their
[01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:48.680]   behavior was better. But that doesn't really explain how they were in the past. But you know what,
[01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:53.000]   let's move on to a happier story and a story I think a lot of people are looking forward to
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:59.720]   hearing about the MacBook Air M2 is officially out. The MacBook Air M2 is sitting right next to me
[01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:05.320]   right now. And you could check out my review over in gadget. I gave it a one of the highest scores
[01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:11.960]   I've ever given anything. I give it a 96 out of 100. So I really like this computer. It is a
[01:24:11.960 --> 01:24:17.320]   sounding it is everything the 13 inch MacBook Pro was not or at least what really disappointed me
[01:24:17.320 --> 01:24:22.600]   about that one was that it was just the old case. This thing's great. I just want to confirm it here
[01:24:22.600 --> 01:24:27.800]   on Twitch. If you're looking for a new Mac computer, you want the new M2 chip, you want new hardware,
[01:24:27.800 --> 01:24:33.080]   you want a new design, you want a slightly larger screen and a thinner case. And this computer feels
[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:39.000]   like magic every time I hold it. So I wholeheartedly recommend this thing. Are you guys excited for
[01:24:39.000 --> 01:24:46.840]   the MacBook Air M2? Well, I mean, I bought I bought a 13 inch M1 last year, which is by far the best
[01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:53.160]   computer I've ever had. So I'm not in the market for this particular machine, but I was actually
[01:24:53.160 --> 01:24:56.760]   worried that you weren't going to promote your own story on the show this week because I was so
[01:24:56.760 --> 01:25:03.000]   excited by your review. I wanted to ask you like you've had the chance to play with this. I think
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:11.320]   many of us looked at the specs of the M2 Pro, which is, you know, it's right. The updated one,
[01:25:11.320 --> 01:25:19.320]   you know, the touch bar and all of that. Is there any reason to your mind for someone to buy that
[01:25:19.320 --> 01:25:25.720]   that M2 Pro would touch with the touch bar over the air because your review makes them seem like
[01:25:25.720 --> 01:25:30.680]   there's just no reason whatsoever to do that. So yeah, I reviewed the MacBook Pro 13 as well
[01:25:30.680 --> 01:25:36.680]   with the M2. And my conclusion is that I don't know who that computer is for. It is so baffling.
[01:25:36.680 --> 01:25:42.200]   It is such a weird computer because, okay, the big difference from the M2 Air is that it has fans.
[01:25:42.200 --> 01:25:47.560]   It has an active cooling system. The air is entirely passively cooled. So that means thermal
[01:25:47.560 --> 01:25:52.040]   throttling. That means, you know, processor throttling if you push that computer too hard.
[01:25:52.040 --> 01:25:58.760]   But so the MacBook Pro can deal with heat better. It can do longer term work. But it's the old case.
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:03.960]   It is the case that they've been evolving since 2016 and it has only two USB-C ports. It doesn't
[01:26:03.960 --> 01:26:10.120]   have an SD card slot. If you're charging that thing, you're using one USB-C port. It has the old screen.
[01:26:10.120 --> 01:26:16.280]   It has, you know, kind of all the other old stuff. Meanwhile, I reviewed the 14-inch and 16-inch
[01:26:16.280 --> 01:26:21.160]   MacBook Pros last year. And those things are incredible. Those things are like exactly what
[01:26:21.160 --> 01:26:25.880]   Pro users have been asking for for so long. And what I discovered is that basically if you
[01:26:26.520 --> 01:26:32.200]   spec up the MacBook Pro 13-inch and just like align it with the 14-inch, which I think is like a
[01:26:32.200 --> 01:26:37.960]   better computer overall, the price difference for like a computer with 16 gigs of RAM,
[01:26:37.960 --> 01:26:42.520]   a terabyte of storage, you know, like the good hardware you'd recommend for everybody,
[01:26:42.520 --> 01:26:48.840]   it's only like a $300 price difference. So at that point, just get the 14-inch MacBook Pro.
[01:26:48.840 --> 01:26:53.720]   Just spend a little more and get the computer with a ProMotion screen and actual ports and so
[01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:59.240]   many things. So yeah, I railed against the MacBook Pro 13 quite a bit in my review of that one that
[01:26:59.240 --> 01:27:04.200]   I gave that much lower score. I hope I wasn't too unfair, but I certainly felt like Apple was
[01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:09.080]   being super lazy with that computer. I don't know if you guys had the same thoughts on that.
[01:27:09.080 --> 01:27:11.240]   Yeah. It's just a baffling distance from them.
[01:27:11.240 --> 01:27:16.840]   I think, was it, John Gruber wrote about this, that it's, it could be a,
[01:27:16.840 --> 01:27:22.840]   there were a victim of the perception of Pro versus Air and the bad experience a lot of people had
[01:27:22.840 --> 01:27:28.840]   with how, you know, in their mind, the association of light and thin is underperforming, which was
[01:27:28.840 --> 01:27:32.920]   certainly the case with the straight up 11-inch MacBook that they did, right, that they discontinued
[01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:38.600]   when they were back on Intel. And now there's, in their second year of their M-line chips,
[01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:44.040]   and it's a hard thing for people to understand how responsive it is and what a big sea change
[01:27:44.040 --> 01:27:49.880]   it is from those Intel space systems. So for a lot of people, maybe when they're shopping,
[01:27:49.880 --> 01:27:53.800]   they just see the word Pro and it's a peace of mind thing that they're like, okay,
[01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:57.640]   even though it's fundamentally the same performance, yes, it has the active cooling,
[01:27:57.640 --> 01:28:03.720]   but they're willing to pay that for, you know, for whatever reason, it's a marketing thing,
[01:28:03.720 --> 01:28:07.400]   where it's a cognitive dissonance thing where they feel like they're getting the better value
[01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:11.240]   out of paying the Pro, which is why reviews exist, which is why, you know, we're having discussion
[01:28:11.240 --> 01:28:18.120]   that people should know that there is no reason not to get that air version of the M2 at 13 inches,
[01:28:18.120 --> 01:28:23.400]   which is the same second. Both of those have the slower 256 gig SSD base models, so it's not even
[01:28:23.400 --> 01:28:26.920]   like, yeah, the Pro 1. Don't buy the base storage, never buy the base storage people, come on.
[01:28:26.920 --> 01:28:31.800]   Yeah, you can't replace those things. Get by as much as you can, please, please.
[01:28:31.800 --> 01:28:37.320]   But yeah, to what you're saying, Norm, yeah, absolutely, absolutely true.
[01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:43.880]   The real question is, if you're doing any sort of work, if you're doing a lot of video editing
[01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:50.520]   or 3D encoding or something, 3D rendering, the air is still a good computer. It'll be fast,
[01:28:50.520 --> 01:28:55.160]   it just won't be as fast as the Pro M2. And if you're doing a lot of that, then don't get the air
[01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:59.640]   at all, get the 4T connection. That was my Pro. Yeah. I was going to say that was my question,
[01:28:59.640 --> 01:29:03.640]   did you run into any throttling? Because part of me is like, if you're editing video, you need the
[01:29:03.640 --> 01:29:10.120]   fan, because I, a friend of mine bought a Surface Pro, and he's like, do me a favor, run a benchmark
[01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:15.400]   on this, because it's driving me insane. And I had like, this is a couple of years ago, and it was,
[01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:19.000]   he was like, I'm delighted with fan listening, like, here's what's happening, it's throttling
[01:29:19.000 --> 01:29:23.560]   down. And when it throttles down, it's actually considerably slower. You know, he had the, you know,
[01:29:23.560 --> 01:29:29.720]   the, the, the core i7 32 gigs of RAM, a brand new processor, this beautiful machine. And it was
[01:29:29.720 --> 01:29:35.400]   running vastly slower than my core i5 three years older, half the memory system, because my laptop
[01:29:35.400 --> 01:29:41.560]   had a fan, his didn't, and the thermal over just crushed it. And it's, it's funny, because I've been
[01:29:41.560 --> 01:29:45.960]   circling around Macbooks again for the first time forever, because a friend of mine, he does
[01:29:45.960 --> 01:29:51.320]   a lot of processor reviews, it's like, yes, I have, I have a $3,000 desktop video editing system,
[01:29:51.320 --> 01:29:57.480]   and my wife's new $1,500 laptop crushes it. Yeah. You know, one, you know, Intel Windows platform,
[01:29:57.480 --> 01:30:03.320]   the other one's, you know, the MacBook. And, but I was curious, did you run into anything other than
[01:30:03.320 --> 01:30:07.640]   like super challenging video, or any other 3D, did you run into any of the throttling or any heat
[01:30:07.640 --> 01:30:13.080]   issues, or was it mostly unnoticeable? There, there are some things like it, because it's
[01:30:13.080 --> 01:30:16.600]   passively cooled, if you're doing a lot of work, like there was a point where I was downloading,
[01:30:16.600 --> 01:30:20.120]   like the handful of steam games that actually run on Macs, like shout out to the Tomb Raider.
[01:30:20.120 --> 01:30:26.440]   So I had like five games downloading, it was like 500 gigabytes of data just coming into my computer,
[01:30:26.440 --> 01:30:30.440]   and then started to feel warm. So it was feeling warm on my lap, it felt warm on the keyboard,
[01:30:30.440 --> 01:30:35.400]   but it's fine. I'm totally to that on laptops, and it wasn't like warm enough to burn me.
[01:30:35.400 --> 01:30:41.000]   In the Cinebench multi-threaded benchmark, I did notice that it was dipping lower than the
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:47.560]   M2 MacBook Pro, and then that's what I expected. You know, that is a harder core video,
[01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:54.200]   it trying to like, you know, mimic video rendering or video processing. So the, that's the heavier one.
[01:30:54.200 --> 01:30:58.120]   It's a little slower, but it's still really fast. It's still faster than most of the Intel systems
[01:30:58.120 --> 01:31:02.920]   I've seen. So if you're doing a handful, like if you're doing like a home movie once in a while,
[01:31:02.920 --> 01:31:09.400]   like every month or so, I don't think it's probably that big of a deal. If you're doing it as a daily
[01:31:09.400 --> 01:31:12.760]   work type of thing, then yeah, you shouldn't be getting the air. You know, if your job is video
[01:31:12.760 --> 01:31:17.560]   editing, then get the pro, but get the right pro, get the 14 or 16 inch, and I know they're
[01:31:17.560 --> 01:31:23.320]   ungodly expensive, but at least the 14 inch is a new design and a much better overall computer
[01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:30.040]   than the 13 inch. Yeah. It really makes me wish I'd gone up to that the 16 inch MacBook when I
[01:31:30.040 --> 01:31:36.520]   bought my M1 last year, because I have to tell you like an air for like throwing in your purse and
[01:31:36.520 --> 01:31:42.360]   just going around town and then a pro to really do your work on. That is a good combination.
[01:31:42.360 --> 01:31:49.080]   I've done that a lot. I'm curious, like the actual M2 itself, do you think, I mean, can you look
[01:31:49.080 --> 01:31:55.160]   into the future and just guess that when Apple eventually puts out those M2 pros for the 14
[01:31:55.160 --> 01:32:00.680]   and 16 inch, I mean, do you think that like a full real version of it? Do you think that's going
[01:32:00.680 --> 01:32:06.920]   to be enough that people like me that, you know, dropped like bought that new MacBook last year
[01:32:06.920 --> 01:32:12.520]   that we would have enough there to make it worth upgrading? I mean, just from what I've seen on
[01:32:12.520 --> 01:32:17.880]   the M2 so far, this the M2 over the M1 is a pretty like minimal bump, right? Overall, it was like an
[01:32:17.880 --> 01:32:22.280]   18% performance improvement. Maybe the pro and max chips and the
[01:32:22.280 --> 01:32:26.360]   ultraships like whenever those arrive, like those those will probably be faster. But
[01:32:26.360 --> 01:32:34.200]   if you look at my benchmark numbers on on our Engadget review, the M1 pro, the M1 max are still
[01:32:34.200 --> 01:32:39.800]   much, much faster than the base like M2 as it is. So if you bought a 14 inch or 16 inch MacBook pro
[01:32:39.800 --> 01:32:44.280]   now, like it would still be much faster. You could wait like maybe we'll see it by the end of the
[01:32:44.280 --> 01:32:49.640]   year. It's really hard to predict anything with Apple. But those things are so fast right now that
[01:32:49.640 --> 01:32:54.200]   I wouldn't be surprised if they waited till spring or something, right? There is there's just like a
[01:32:54.200 --> 01:32:59.080]   lot of like delays happening across the industry. And I don't know if Apple's going to push for
[01:32:59.080 --> 01:33:04.280]   that or if they're going to focus more on like there's rumors of like an iMac pro or something
[01:33:04.280 --> 01:33:09.800]   coming back. And that was like a disaster, you know, that was an ill advise upgrade back around
[01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:15.400]   2017 when that came out. But yeah, it is a tough place to be if you don't know,
[01:33:15.400 --> 01:33:22.040]   I guess if you're trying to upgrade and you don't know if you should wait or not, and you need a
[01:33:22.040 --> 01:33:25.720]   computer right now, I say just buy what's out there right now. If it gets closer to the fall,
[01:33:25.720 --> 01:33:33.560]   then just sit tight. Yeah. There were a bunch of phones. I'll also say, you know, it's their target
[01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:37.160]   user. The most people, if I understand if we're buying this or looking at these are students,
[01:33:37.160 --> 01:33:42.280]   right? And they're buying a system for every four years or something, right? The system you're
[01:33:42.280 --> 01:33:47.240]   going to spend $1,500 to $2,000 on should last you four years. And it's very interesting to think
[01:33:47.240 --> 01:33:51.800]   about how we think about phones and how people are and I'm on an upgrade plan for a phone. So I'm
[01:33:51.800 --> 01:33:56.680]   excited for a new phone every year, but I don't certainly don't think of a computer that way. So
[01:33:56.680 --> 01:34:03.400]   the thing with MacBooks and computer systems in general is I'm kind of looking for that sweet spot
[01:34:03.400 --> 01:34:07.960]   of when when is it like going to be the best, not only value for what I'm paying for now, but I'm not
[01:34:07.960 --> 01:34:13.480]   going to feel like I was shorted two or three years later because of something of big C change
[01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:18.840]   in design or efficiency. And that's where it feels like this M2 system is a nice sweet spot,
[01:34:18.840 --> 01:34:27.880]   because it is a chassis change. There's maturity in their their ARM base OS and native support for
[01:34:27.880 --> 01:34:33.160]   it. And like you said, like 20% improvement feels like the natural year over year. It's not going to
[01:34:33.160 --> 01:34:35.960]   be the massive jump that the M1 was over the Intel systems.
[01:34:35.960 --> 01:34:41.800]   Yep, absolutely. Absolutely. And you know, I come from an IT background guys. So and also a
[01:34:41.800 --> 01:34:47.800]   background of watching you, Patrick and Leo early back in the days, like late 90s tech TV and ZDTV.
[01:34:47.800 --> 01:34:53.400]   So all the lessons you guys gave us back then like aim forward, aim forward when you're when
[01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:58.600]   you're speccing up. So the thing I used to tell students and you know, honestly professors at
[01:34:58.600 --> 01:35:04.680]   the college I was working as like aim for a four year lifespan with your machine. And I looking at
[01:35:04.680 --> 01:35:08.840]   the macro pro 13, it seems like it's already four years out of eight. It just like physically
[01:35:08.840 --> 01:35:14.120]   compared to all the other hardware Apple has like, yeah, it was basically the design from four
[01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:18.360]   years ago. So you don't want to get that computer folks. But you know what, we're going to be
[01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:23.320]   talking more about some other Apple news. They released their public beta's this week. But let's
[01:35:23.320 --> 01:35:28.360]   go back to Leo for one more word from our sponsors. Thank you, Devendra. Hello, everybody.
[01:35:28.360 --> 01:35:33.080]   Yes, I came back to talk to about a brand new sponsor. We really are thrilled to welcome

[01:38:13.160 --> 01:38:21.640]   Now back to Devindra. Thanks Leo. In other Apple news this week, we also got our first public
[01:38:21.640 --> 01:38:28.680]   previews of their next upcoming operating systems, iOS 16, macOS Ventura, the new iPadOS and WatchOS
[01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:35.160]   9. I've been testing macOS Ventura and I wrote a preview over it and gadget as well. And I have
[01:38:35.160 --> 01:38:42.040]   to say, I'm glad I have a time, I have a platform to finally say, I hate the OSX dock. I have hated
[01:38:42.040 --> 01:38:48.840]   it since 2001. It is awful and it is really nice to see Apple explore new ways to manage your
[01:38:48.840 --> 01:38:55.640]   windows on Macs and for macOS Ventura, that is stage manager, which is this like left hand
[01:38:55.640 --> 01:39:01.160]   side screen that lets you cycle between your four most recently used apps. You can group apps
[01:39:01.160 --> 01:39:07.080]   together. It is a very nice way to jump back into different windows and different apps and
[01:39:07.080 --> 01:39:11.960]   so much better than the dock. I hate the dock. I'm glad the dock is gone. Have you guys seen this
[01:39:11.960 --> 01:39:16.280]   thing? Because stage manager is also going to be an iPad. So it's also kind of changed the way
[01:39:16.280 --> 01:39:19.480]   multitasking works on iPads too. Are you excited about what's coming?
[01:39:19.480 --> 01:39:25.960]   I'm not completely sold on it because I've not personally used it yet, but I completely agree with
[01:39:25.960 --> 01:39:35.560]   the sentiments in your piece. I think that some Mac users like myself are so used to the bad
[01:39:35.560 --> 01:39:43.000]   paradigm there that you don't even see it anymore. I think people don't understand just how much
[01:39:43.000 --> 01:39:50.760]   better window management is overall over on windows these days. So I think it's by far the
[01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:59.880]   weakest part of this. I have to tell you my basically, I guess my mother-in-law, we bought her a Mac.
[01:40:00.440 --> 01:40:07.240]   She's a librarian and I'm trying to teach like an 80 year old woman to use at Mac OS. And she just
[01:40:07.240 --> 01:40:12.360]   flat out could not figure out the dock and how to click around on things. This is not someone
[01:40:12.360 --> 01:40:19.000]   uneducated. This is someone who worked as a librarian through most of her career. So I'm psyched to
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:25.400]   try this, but I'm not completely sold on it yet because I think the paradigm that they've made
[01:40:25.400 --> 01:40:30.040]   just seems like it would make more sense on iPad, but I'm excited to try.
[01:40:30.040 --> 01:40:35.400]   For sure, for sure. I do want to point out like I think even Apple realized the dock was kind
[01:40:35.400 --> 01:40:41.960]   of a problem because in 2003 they unveiled expose, which is that feature that lets you like blow
[01:40:41.960 --> 01:40:46.120]   up all the windows and see everything running or windows for a specific app. And since that came
[01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:51.160]   out, it's now part of mission control. That's I need that in every Mac. I cannot use a Mac without
[01:40:51.160 --> 01:40:55.080]   being able to blow up the windows because I never want to touch the dock, but Norm, Patrick,
[01:40:55.080 --> 01:40:58.440]   any thoughts? Do you want to get anything off your chest about the dock?
[01:40:58.440 --> 01:41:06.040]   I'm a Windows user. So it's all tab windows tab. I mean, that's sure. That's what I've been using.
[01:41:06.040 --> 01:41:10.120]   I like expose the open or use and the kind of multi gesture way of getting it.
[01:41:10.120 --> 01:41:15.640]   I'm really curious about state manager for iPad. I know there's been that controversy about limiting
[01:41:15.640 --> 01:41:19.960]   it to the only the newest iPads and whether that's an actual necessity and how performance
[01:41:19.960 --> 01:41:25.560]   hungry it is. But from a design standpoint, is this from your perspective places where
[01:41:25.560 --> 01:41:31.240]   Mac OS and iOS start to merge and you see a future where that's kind of how they're going to design
[01:41:31.240 --> 01:41:37.480]   these features going forward? It does. It does kind of feel like that. I mean, I'm the weirdo who
[01:41:37.480 --> 01:41:43.640]   keeps saying why why does Mac OS still look like it did in 2001 like fundamentally like the overall
[01:41:43.640 --> 01:41:48.680]   shape of it and the basic thing is what it looked like when Windows XP came out and then the Mac
[01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:55.560]   users start throwing things at me. So I just shut up. But it does feel like that idea of being able
[01:41:55.560 --> 01:42:00.680]   to share features between iPad OS and iOS is kind of one way for them to kind of change the way
[01:42:00.680 --> 01:42:06.360]   Macs are going. It is funny though, because just talking about the MacBook Air, right? That thing
[01:42:06.360 --> 01:42:13.560]   weighs 2.6, 2.7 pounds. It is really, really light. And then I remember that the iPad Pro 12.9
[01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:19.640]   inch with the new keyboard, the Smart Folio weighs more than the MacBook Air. And that just made me
[01:42:19.640 --> 01:42:26.920]   think like I don't understand Apple's portability push or argument here for the iPad Pro because now
[01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:31.720]   the air is actually kind of out doing the iPad Pro. It has been for the past two years, but it's
[01:42:31.720 --> 01:42:38.360]   even more so with the new M2 MacBook Air. Sure, they're sharing features. I think that at least
[01:42:38.360 --> 01:42:43.000]   it's one way for Mac OS to evolve. Like now you can auto hide the dock just for the line stage
[01:42:43.000 --> 01:42:47.400]   manager from moving between apps. You could still use Xpose. You could basically pick and choose
[01:42:47.400 --> 01:42:52.360]   whatever you want. I just feel like the dock is kind of the worst possible entry. But Patrick,
[01:42:52.360 --> 01:43:01.640]   get in the box. Not a single one that you swan enough time. I think they're kind of reaping this
[01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:07.880]   whole the line they've drawn between not a touchscreen and not touchscreen, right? And they want they
[01:43:07.880 --> 01:43:11.320]   want to have their cake and eat it too. Or they want people to buy multiple devices. Or you can't
[01:43:11.320 --> 01:43:15.000]   have they're not going to put touch screens on Mac books because they want you to have an iPad
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:19.000]   as well. But for a lot of people and they had the whole ad campaign of like children, you know,
[01:43:19.000 --> 01:43:23.800]   saying, you know, what's a computer? Because their computer is an iPad, right? They just know
[01:43:23.800 --> 01:43:29.160]   their computer device is an iPad. But as complexity increases on those, you're running to limits of
[01:43:29.160 --> 01:43:35.800]   what touchscreen only input can do as great as touchscreen is. And that's why, you know,
[01:43:35.800 --> 01:43:41.320]   people have to buy these, you know, the keyboards and the folios as expensive as they are. And
[01:43:41.320 --> 01:43:45.720]   eventually they got to they got to choose like, are they going to make the Mac more accessible or
[01:43:45.720 --> 01:43:52.120]   they're going to make the iPad more feature full or expect people to keep on buying both? Because
[01:43:52.120 --> 01:43:58.440]   iPad users are going to always want to ask for more features. And Mac OS users are going to want to
[01:43:58.440 --> 01:44:07.080]   ask for just easier ways to get through the complexity of it. I don't know. I think I
[01:44:07.080 --> 01:44:14.120]   I don't think there's like any like, like evil, like Tim Cook rubbing his hands together. Like,
[01:44:14.120 --> 01:44:22.200]   we will never bring the touchscreen to the Mac so we can sell our iPads. I think, you know, there
[01:44:22.200 --> 01:44:30.840]   has traditionally been a lot of fear in the Mac community that this kind of crossover between,
[01:44:30.840 --> 01:44:39.960]   you know, I basically iOS and Mac OS was going to make Mac OS less of a professional tool. I think
[01:44:39.960 --> 01:44:48.120]   that is a it's a it's a fair worry to have just because, you know, one is as you say, it is more for
[01:44:48.840 --> 01:44:54.680]   it's just straightforward is something children can use. The others like a professional environment
[01:44:54.680 --> 01:45:00.920]   that many of us have been using for our whole careers. I just I think especially with the unified
[01:45:00.920 --> 01:45:06.200]   stack as you know, both of them being on the same architecture now with with Apple Silicon.
[01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:13.560]   I think that ship is sailed. And what I think is so ironic now is you know, Apple spends so much
[01:45:13.560 --> 01:45:18.600]   of their time like, Oh, we're going to make this so elegant. We're going to hopefully get rid of
[01:45:18.600 --> 01:45:24.840]   USB type a ports on your machine to make it more beautiful and easier to use. But if you actually
[01:45:24.840 --> 01:45:32.040]   look at the window management of any real Mac user, it's a mess. You've got like over in your
[01:45:32.040 --> 01:45:37.560]   notification trays can give you five updates you need to install. You have random windows all
[01:45:37.560 --> 01:45:43.000]   around the screen. Some doc thing is going to be jumping up and down. It's it's an absolute
[01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:50.280]   disaster. So I do think for professional users, it's time to come in there and try something like
[01:45:50.280 --> 01:45:57.880]   stage manager. And but you're really dealing with a very different kind of user there. I mean,
[01:45:57.880 --> 01:46:03.320]   John Syracuse, I'll never forget reading some of his Mac OS reviews. Back when was, you know,
[01:46:03.320 --> 01:46:09.640]   OS 10, talking about his anger that he couldn't get it to snap over to the same pixel on his
[01:46:09.640 --> 01:46:15.080]   MacBook every single time, no matter what he did. Like, like you're really dealing with the kind
[01:46:15.080 --> 01:46:20.760]   of OCD kind of person here. So we don't like change. That's just how we are.
[01:46:20.760 --> 01:46:26.520]   You know what I link to a Syracuse review also in my preview piece because his original review
[01:46:26.520 --> 01:46:32.360]   for us 10 OS X, I don't know what you know, the name has changed all over the place. But he points
[01:46:32.360 --> 01:46:38.840]   out the same doc issue. Why it's hard. You know, it's tough. Like say you had multiple safari
[01:46:38.840 --> 01:46:42.440]   windows open, right? And you had other windows on top of your safari. And you need to go back to
[01:46:42.440 --> 01:46:47.080]   that one specific one that has your Gmail tab or something. The way you do it with the doc before
[01:46:47.080 --> 01:46:52.760]   expose anything is yet to click on the doc or can command click on the doc and then look at the
[01:46:52.760 --> 01:46:57.560]   drop down, try to figure out which window among the drop down it is and then click that. And
[01:46:57.560 --> 01:47:04.200]   Windows XP was far uglier in 2001. I think it was XP by that point. It was super ugly, but
[01:47:04.200 --> 01:47:09.320]   it's click one button on the taskbar. That's it. I just look at the taskbar and click down. I know
[01:47:09.320 --> 01:47:13.400]   keyboard shortcuts are thing, but I also don't want to like tap, tap, tap, tap, tap. I want to like
[01:47:13.400 --> 01:47:18.600]   just move and click because my hands is on the mouse more. So you know, I'm glad I'm glad I had
[01:47:18.600 --> 01:47:25.320]   support back then from John's here, Qza. There was there was one other Apple story this week that I
[01:47:25.320 --> 01:47:29.720]   think a lot of people are reading a lot into Apple and I said they're ending their consulting
[01:47:29.720 --> 01:47:35.240]   agreement with Johnny Ive, a former design leader because he went off and started his own thing and
[01:47:35.240 --> 01:47:40.120]   everybody was like, don't worry, he's still gonna work with Apple. And now they've agreed to stop
[01:47:40.120 --> 01:47:46.280]   working together according to two people with knowledge of the agreement. End of an era, I guess.
[01:47:46.280 --> 01:47:51.400]   I don't know if you guys have deep thoughts about this, but I have my frustrations with Ives
[01:47:51.400 --> 01:47:55.560]   designs too. Like I blame him for losing a lot of the ports and things like that.
[01:47:55.560 --> 01:48:02.840]   Yes. Well, I have a lot of thoughts on this. Like I think in some ways Apple design has gotten
[01:48:02.840 --> 01:48:09.720]   much better since Ives left and I think the 14 inch M1 notebook is a really good example of this.
[01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:20.440]   I think clearly I've pushed many Apple designs like for minimalism over pragmatism, a really good
[01:48:20.440 --> 01:48:27.960]   example being that Gefamis scissor keyboard design, which is the charging cable underneath the mouse.
[01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:35.080]   I will never forgive anybody for that. Oh my god. Mistakes for me. Mistakes for me. I think in some,
[01:48:35.080 --> 01:48:42.920]   I think there's a really good argument that it's gotten better in many respects since he left.
[01:48:42.920 --> 01:48:49.720]   And the reporting goes on to say a lot of Apple people were a very curious what he was being paid
[01:48:49.720 --> 01:48:56.520]   $100 million to design exactly and be very frustrated that he seemed to their allegations that he kept
[01:48:56.520 --> 01:49:03.960]   poaching key people from Apple's design team, which just seems like not good. On the other hand,
[01:49:03.960 --> 01:49:13.240]   I do have to look at what Apple's been putting out in the last few years. And let's be honest
[01:49:13.240 --> 01:49:20.280]   here, there's a lot of lack of whimsy with what Apple's been putting out. It's all really good
[01:49:20.280 --> 01:49:27.000]   industrial design. But if you're looking at the new iPads or the MacBooks, there's nothing out
[01:49:27.000 --> 01:49:34.920]   there that's really groundbreaking the way that the trash cam Mac Pro, which not a successful Pro
[01:49:34.920 --> 01:49:40.520]   computer, but certainly a stunning design. We're thinking about this over on Rocket,
[01:49:40.520 --> 01:49:45.800]   that the most interesting thing Apple has really put out in the last three or four years was that
[01:49:45.800 --> 01:49:54.280]   the AirPod Max, what's the overhead headphone things? The case. Exactly. AirPod Max. Yeah.
[01:49:54.280 --> 01:50:00.040]   Yeah. It looks like a bra. That's the most interesting thing that they've put out in a long
[01:50:00.040 --> 01:50:05.800]   time. So I think it wasn't interesting because it was a whimsy. Yeah. Yeah. I was going to say
[01:50:05.800 --> 01:50:09.800]   it wasn't interesting because it was positive. It was interesting because it seemed to have the
[01:50:09.800 --> 01:50:14.360]   worst of an extra accessory without doing any of the things you expected the accessory for.
[01:50:14.360 --> 01:50:22.360]   Right. I mean, there's part of me like, there was Johnny Ivan, Steve Jobs, and then there's Johnny
[01:50:22.360 --> 01:50:29.160]   Ivan after Steve Jobs. And there was things like, I don't see, there's a lot of things I can see
[01:50:29.160 --> 01:50:35.320]   happening that maybe they would have been exactly the same if Steve Jobs hadn't passed. But I look
[01:50:35.320 --> 01:50:42.440]   like the Apple watch and the watching the interface on that and how it came out. There was buttons
[01:50:42.440 --> 01:50:47.880]   and there was the knob on the side. And I remember being like, this just seems to be the worst of
[01:50:47.880 --> 01:50:56.040]   every possible world on an interface. And I will also be like, I am so over the obsession with
[01:50:56.040 --> 01:51:02.600]   thinness and the removal of ports. And I feel like a lot of what's happened is that as Johnny
[01:51:02.600 --> 01:51:07.080]   as maybe has it been like, we must make everything thinner to the point where it collapses if you
[01:51:07.080 --> 01:51:11.960]   pick it up. And if you need a port, you're obviously doing everything wrong. And you know,
[01:51:11.960 --> 01:51:18.600]   I'm with you that Mac Pro was gorgeous, you know, fundamentally useless for the way people actually
[01:51:18.600 --> 01:51:24.600]   use Mac Pros in the role. Yeah. The other thing I'm over with Patrick, sorry to interrupt.
[01:51:24.600 --> 01:51:30.200]   I think I'm over with is also just singular designers being credited with with everything.
[01:51:30.200 --> 01:51:34.120]   Because even, you know, under Johnny Ives, it's a whole design team. But when you have the
[01:51:34.120 --> 01:51:40.280]   utilization of whether it's one designer or an engineer or a founder, you know, being the person
[01:51:40.280 --> 01:51:45.240]   the consumers are associated with and put on pedestal, when it's yes, they provide the guidance
[01:51:45.240 --> 01:51:51.560]   and it's their direction. Ultimately, they might make decisions. I like not knowing necessarily
[01:51:51.560 --> 01:51:58.200]   who are the design leads at Apple and just evaluating the products as they are and not
[01:51:58.200 --> 01:52:04.520]   having that hype of the Johnny Ives, you know, carefully scripted commercial that plays at every
[01:52:04.520 --> 01:52:12.520]   keynote. Right. Absolutely. You know, a friend of mine was saying was asking me like, you know,
[01:52:12.520 --> 01:52:16.680]   who would who would Steve Jobs be without Johnny Ives? And I kind of think the more interesting
[01:52:16.680 --> 01:52:20.680]   question is who would Johnny Ives be without Steve Jobs? You know, like who would let him just
[01:52:20.680 --> 01:52:25.640]   like go wild, buck wild with these designs and give him full reign and full power to do that.
[01:52:25.640 --> 01:52:32.760]   It was a for two at his meeting between two very specific, you know, aesthetic designers,
[01:52:32.760 --> 01:52:39.320]   because Jobs was kind of a design mine too. So just like a weird thing, hard to tell and I don't
[01:52:39.320 --> 01:52:43.480]   know what Johnny Ives is going to be doing next. But I will say, I'm really excited about what
[01:52:43.480 --> 01:52:47.480]   Apple is doing next, because at least they're going to look a little more interesting, be a
[01:52:47.480 --> 01:52:53.160]   little more different. This MacBook Air M2 just really gives me hope that they're leaning back
[01:52:53.160 --> 01:52:57.960]   into functionality, although this thing has a headphone jack. And I'm looking at those like
[01:52:57.960 --> 01:53:02.600]   those little millimeters, you know, above and below the headphone jack. And I'm sure some designer
[01:53:02.600 --> 01:53:08.680]   at Apple's like, if we just take that out, this will be even thinner guys, could have a finished
[01:53:08.680 --> 01:53:13.240]   MacBook ever ever made. And that's something they did with the iPad Pro. The iPad Pro does not have
[01:53:13.240 --> 01:53:18.360]   a you. It doesn't have a headphone jack. So it could they could easily end up doing that. Who knows?
[01:53:19.960 --> 01:53:23.720]   Yeah, I guess we'll see. I guess we'll see. I guess exciting times for Apple.
[01:53:23.720 --> 01:53:29.080]   Honestly, I'm interested to see what Johnny Ives does next as well. Yeah, any deeper thoughts about
[01:53:29.080 --> 01:53:32.040]   the Ive era? I guess this is truly the end of the Ive era, right?
[01:53:32.040 --> 01:53:38.680]   I mean, I think that there was a headlines that said it best, like he made the entire tech industry
[01:53:38.680 --> 01:53:44.280]   care about industrial design. And you know, Norman, just to bounce off of your point, I completely
[01:53:44.280 --> 01:53:49.640]   agree. He is over-credited. You can read books on him and it was a team of people working with him,
[01:53:49.640 --> 01:53:56.600]   structural engineers, material engineers, a lot of what made Apple so successful is really new
[01:53:56.600 --> 01:54:03.480]   composite metals that they made. Johnny Ives is not a metal orgist, you know. So, you know,
[01:54:03.480 --> 01:54:10.680]   it's but his legacy was making the whole industry care more about design. I would actually, I would
[01:54:10.680 --> 01:54:16.200]   go the opposite way though. I would challenge Apple to start highlighting some of their other
[01:54:16.200 --> 01:54:23.560]   talent in the design world at this keynote. It's something we don't talk about as much today because
[01:54:23.560 --> 01:54:30.440]   Apple has gotten so much better at it. But you know, it was as recently as 2011, 2012,
[01:54:30.440 --> 01:54:37.560]   Apple would never have women speaking at WWDC or at these keynotes. It would be one dude after
[01:54:37.560 --> 01:54:42.920]   another, all generally white dudes. And you know, they've gotten a lot better at letting other
[01:54:42.920 --> 01:54:48.360]   people kind of represent the company. I would love to meet and know some of the people working on
[01:54:48.360 --> 01:54:53.640]   the design team doing this really interesting work. Who's the person that that fixed the keyboard,
[01:54:53.640 --> 01:55:02.760]   bring them forward? I would hear some of these stories, like, like promote them and let
[01:55:02.760 --> 01:55:09.640]   someone else like be a fable for the next generation of Apple, the way that they kind of built up
[01:55:09.640 --> 01:55:14.840]   Johnny Hive. I would really like to see that. I would totally like to see that too. And certainly
[01:55:14.840 --> 01:55:19.640]   we are seeing in these new betas, like we're seeing all sorts of new design ideas too, right? There is
[01:55:19.640 --> 01:55:25.080]   continuity camera, which is I think the single wildest thing I've seen from Apple in the past
[01:55:25.080 --> 01:55:29.960]   decade, right? Like of here is a thing you put on your MacBook and you put your phone on the thing
[01:55:29.960 --> 01:55:35.640]   and your phone is your webcam, which seems like both an admission that their webcams are terrible,
[01:55:35.640 --> 01:55:43.400]   which they're not that great, even the one in the new MacBook Air, but also that this is a really
[01:55:43.400 --> 01:55:47.960]   confusing thing. I still haven't gotten into work in the beta OS's I have. I have to do some
[01:55:47.960 --> 01:55:52.200]   reinstalling probably, but is that a thing you're interested in doing? Or is that just like a weird
[01:55:52.200 --> 01:55:56.600]   idea somebody had? And Apple was just like, hey, go for it, which I feel like was never a thing
[01:55:56.600 --> 01:56:02.920]   that could have happened before. Well, I'm sure that's it's fun. I was going to say because
[01:56:03.480 --> 01:56:09.240]   everybody's webcams in their laptops are atrocious. There's incredible physical limitations. I'm
[01:56:09.240 --> 01:56:13.800]   still just grateful that Dell finally went, you know, we can give ourselves three millimeter at the
[01:56:13.800 --> 01:56:20.520]   top and bury camera there because really, it was like how much nostril cam can anyone take in one
[01:56:20.520 --> 01:56:27.080]   lifetime, right? And it was just, you know, people are also realizing a lot of people realize like,
[01:56:27.080 --> 01:56:32.280]   oh, my webcam looks like crap, but my iPhone looks great. Why can't I use these together? And I think
[01:56:32.280 --> 01:56:35.800]   that's the kind of aesthetic decision that would have been like, no, no, no, no, by the way, you
[01:56:35.800 --> 01:56:39.560]   also hold your iPhone like this. And if you hold it with four fingers, you're using it wrong.
[01:56:39.560 --> 01:56:45.080]   Anybody remember that? Like, you know, we didn't test us with normal people. And if we did be told
[01:56:45.080 --> 01:56:49.480]   them the way they held their phone was wrong, because really who holds their phone with their
[01:56:49.480 --> 01:56:54.760]   entire hand when you can hold a, you know, $1,000 device with two fingers and have it work? Apparently,
[01:56:54.760 --> 01:57:00.040]   I'm still a little bitter about that face. But you know, I think it's a smart decision because,
[01:57:00.040 --> 01:57:04.840]   you know, yes, I have a, you know, I have a four micro four thirds camera in here. I have a decent
[01:57:04.840 --> 01:57:08.760]   lens on and I have lighting in here. And the reality is, is there's a lot more people who
[01:57:08.760 --> 01:57:13.720]   running Mac hardware that have an iPhone than there are people who want to deal with doing an HDMI
[01:57:13.720 --> 01:57:18.440]   interface, you know, to a camera with a semi professional lens. And, you know, everybody's got
[01:57:18.440 --> 01:57:23.000]   their phone with them. So it seems smart to me. It seems thoughtful to me. It seems to like they're
[01:57:23.000 --> 01:57:26.760]   very acknowledging the needs of the community, because a lot of people would like their video to
[01:57:26.760 --> 01:57:31.560]   look better. And it just so happens your cameras got a pretty bitchin or your phone,
[01:57:31.560 --> 01:57:36.680]   I should say. Yeah, pretty bitchin camera inside of it. It's a phone too, by the way.
[01:57:36.680 --> 01:57:42.520]   Yeah. It reinforces the fact that the phones have become more and more imaging devices first.
[01:57:42.520 --> 01:57:48.360]   The killer app is the phone and they've put so much R&D and to and even gone to thicker phones
[01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:52.760]   because of it. So they can facilitate the better cameras. The feature I'm most curious about
[01:57:52.760 --> 01:57:58.520]   related to that is how they're making use of the wide angle camera to warp a downward angle view,
[01:57:58.520 --> 01:58:02.760]   kind of like how, you know, cars with their wide angle cameras can create almost a control and
[01:58:02.760 --> 01:58:10.120]   like view around you. And then what the imagery we saw from the keynote of that was, I think,
[01:58:10.120 --> 01:58:16.520]   too crisp. I was not I was very skeptical of how how that look because if you look at the edge of
[01:58:16.520 --> 01:58:21.880]   even their ultra wide camera, if you start warping that, like there's only so much clarity you can get.
[01:58:22.600 --> 01:58:27.720]   Yeah, I haven't gotten to work yet, but some YouTubers have, I believe, Dave Lee, Dave 2D on
[01:58:27.720 --> 01:58:31.800]   YouTube has been doing some testing with that. And it does look like his fingers get super long
[01:58:31.800 --> 01:58:35.800]   and stretched. But if something is flat on the table in front of you, you do get really nice,
[01:58:35.800 --> 01:58:41.320]   like very pretty clear, like overhead camera view, which again, who thought of that? Like,
[01:58:41.320 --> 01:58:46.200]   I need that story. I need that background of like, where did this idea come from? Why did it like,
[01:58:46.200 --> 01:58:50.520]   get all the way up the chain of command to being shown and being a shipping feature in the OS?
[01:58:51.320 --> 01:58:55.720]   Just kind of a wild thing for Apple to do. And I had the opportunity to ask Apple like several
[01:58:55.720 --> 01:58:59.640]   times, and they're never going to give you specifics. But they're like, you know, we thought this would
[01:58:59.640 --> 01:59:05.240]   be a cool feature. The one thing I will say, other than being like kind of annoying to set up,
[01:59:05.240 --> 01:59:08.600]   I wonder how many people are going to miss having a phone to fiddle with when you should be paying
[01:59:08.600 --> 01:59:12.760]   attention to video chat. So that's one thing that could be working against this feature,
[01:59:12.760 --> 01:59:18.200]   not that you guys are doing that at all during this show. But you know, that is the thing we've
[01:59:18.200 --> 01:59:23.160]   grown used to having a second screen in our hands or nearby, letting go of your phone a little bit,
[01:59:23.160 --> 01:59:27.720]   just for better video quality. I don't know if that's going to end up making it like less useful
[01:59:27.720 --> 01:59:33.000]   for a lot of people. But yeah, we will we will see and actually something related to what Apple's
[01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:36.760]   going to be doing soon. I want to talk about next. But let's let's have it to Leo.
[01:59:36.760 --> 01:59:41.240]   Could I just say something about this? Because I go ahead to weigh in on this.
[01:59:41.960 --> 01:59:49.480]   No, it just seems to me like, you know, Dr. Dre sold beats because he was able to think about a
[01:59:49.480 --> 01:59:56.360]   segment of the market that everyone else was not thinking about at that time, which was headphones.
[01:59:56.360 --> 02:00:00.200]   And he was right about that. There were people that wanted to have colorful headphones like
[02:00:00.200 --> 02:00:06.920]   they were sneakers that just the tech market completely missed. There are two separate companies
[02:00:06.920 --> 02:00:12.200]   out there right now that are understanding. We're all doing video chats all the time now.
[02:00:12.200 --> 02:00:18.520]   People want better cameras here. I would note that you know, Norman, you and Patrick both have
[02:00:18.520 --> 02:00:24.360]   some really nice setups with up the field there, which I'm very envious of. I need it. I need it.
[02:00:24.360 --> 02:00:30.040]   Yeah. Yeah. There are people out there that want better solutions for this. I am certainly one of
[02:00:30.040 --> 02:00:36.680]   them. Yeah, my setup is I end up just using a cheap razor keyo, you know, like this this $100
[02:00:36.680 --> 02:00:41.880]   camera and some good lights. I think that there's a lot of innovation that's possible here.
[02:00:41.880 --> 02:00:48.040]   I think long term, you know, people are not going to like attach their their camera to their Mac book
[02:00:48.040 --> 02:00:55.480]   in a, you know, it's just not an Apple solution long term. But I think that there is a growing
[02:00:55.480 --> 02:01:02.600]   market for better video broadcasting equipment out there. I hope Apple is going to fill that.
[02:01:02.600 --> 02:01:08.120]   But someone's certain issue. Yeah, it's surprising they haven't like done an action camera. It seems
[02:01:08.120 --> 02:01:13.160]   like they always are very closely aligned to GoPro and everything. But who knows? Who knows? Yeah.
[02:01:13.160 --> 02:01:17.640]   I mean, GoPro's crashed and burned so hard in the last few years. I don't think anybody really
[02:01:17.640 --> 02:01:21.960]   wants to make an expensive action camera. It's true. It's just GoPro. But your phone should be
[02:01:21.960 --> 02:01:29.000]   your action camera. Yeah. Basically, basically. But you know what? Let's let's hop over to Leo for
[02:01:29.000 --> 02:01:34.120]   one more word from our sponsors. Hello, everybody. One more time I want to interrupt one more time
[02:01:34.120 --> 02:01:39.480]   than I'm going to go get back on the boat. Thank you, David, for doing a great job for me filling
[02:01:39.480 --> 02:01:44.600]   in. It's nice to know the Twitter is in great hands. I want to tell you a little bit kind of a
[02:01:44.600 --> 02:01:50.680]   story when I talk to people, especially young people about savings. Look, I'm close to retirement
[02:01:50.680 --> 02:02:00.200]   age and I've got a nice little nest egg. And I learned early on that the key to saving for your
[02:02:00.200 --> 02:02:04.120]   financial future. And that doesn't just have to be retirement could be buying that first house
[02:02:04.120 --> 02:02:12.280]   or putting the kids through college or even just getting a car. The key is long term wealth
[02:02:12.280 --> 02:02:19.080]   building designed to weather any market condition. Look, stocks go up and down. That's part of the
[02:02:19.080 --> 02:02:24.040]   deal. That's how it works. But if you're smart about it, if you know what you're doing,
[02:02:24.040 --> 02:02:31.560]   you don't let that bother you. You can build over a period of time a great nest egg for yourself.
[02:02:31.560 --> 02:02:37.480]   Wealthfront is the way to go. It's a financial services company. They've been around since 2008
[02:02:37.480 --> 02:02:42.760]   and they were founded with one goal in mind to make building this long term wealth delightfully
[02:02:42.760 --> 02:02:47.720]   easy. Now, if you saw the, you know, if you go and look at the stock market, you probably don't
[02:02:47.720 --> 02:02:54.920]   like what you see. The people who freak out at this point, the day traders, the buy and sell,
[02:02:54.920 --> 02:03:02.120]   you know, buy low sell high people, those guys are going crazy right now. But what you see is really
[02:03:02.120 --> 02:03:07.560]   a matter of perspective with Wealthfront. You're investing with a different vision focused on
[02:03:07.560 --> 02:03:12.680]   long term wealth designed to weather these up and down markets, even the one we're in now.
[02:03:13.720 --> 02:03:19.240]   This isn't anything unusual. This is part of the cycle. But with Wealthfront, you get a pre-built
[02:03:19.240 --> 02:03:27.160]   diversified portfolio that spreads your investing eggs. It spreads your investments
[02:03:27.160 --> 02:03:33.160]   across more baskets. You know what I'm saying? Maybe not the most felicitous way to put it,
[02:03:33.160 --> 02:03:40.120]   but it spreads your investments across, diversifies it. It's a time-tested way to
[02:03:40.120 --> 02:03:44.600]   build long term wealth and weather, whatever volatility happens at the market at any given time.
[02:03:44.600 --> 02:03:50.680]   In fact, really now is a great time to get started in Wealthfront, probably the best time ever
[02:03:50.680 --> 02:03:56.680]   to get started in Wealthfront. The trick to Wealth isn't timing, not when you get in, but time,
[02:03:56.680 --> 02:04:01.880]   how long you're in. So if you're young, especially, I want you to pay attention to this,
[02:04:01.880 --> 02:04:06.760]   by automating your investments, it makes it easier to do the thing you must do, which is
[02:04:06.760 --> 02:04:11.960]   every paycheck you invest regularly, regardless of the ups and downs. They call it dollar cost
[02:04:11.960 --> 02:04:17.240]   averaging. It's a discipline that's so important that makes such a huge difference. If you want to
[02:04:17.240 --> 02:04:22.920]   invest for the long term, while the market is basically having a clearance sale, this is the time.
[02:04:22.920 --> 02:04:29.480]   This is the time. But keep putting it in, right? Don't just go, "Oh, and then stop." Wealthfront
[02:04:29.480 --> 02:04:34.680]   makes it really easy every paycheck to invest a little bit, invest a little bit, answer a few
[02:04:34.680 --> 02:04:38.920]   questions about your risk level and your future plan. So they kind of get to know what it is you're
[02:04:38.920 --> 02:04:44.600]   looking for. They will personalize a portfolio built for the long term. And really, that's it.
[02:04:44.600 --> 02:04:49.960]   Except for you're going to get a $50 bonus to start your nest egg right now if you sign up today.
[02:04:49.960 --> 02:04:55.880]   Wealthfront voted the best overall robo-advisor by Investopedia. Half a million people have been
[02:04:55.880 --> 02:05:03.320]   building their Wealth with Wealthfront, $27 billion in managed assets. Start right now, get a bonus,
[02:05:03.320 --> 02:05:09.400]   $50 when you start investing with Wealthfront. Today, go to wealthfront.com/twit. Don't put it off.
[02:05:09.400 --> 02:05:17.800]   That's wealthfront.com/twit. Needless to say, this a bit of investing wisdom is a paid
[02:05:17.800 --> 02:05:25.320]   and wealthfront.com/twit. All right. Enough of that. I got an Apparile Spritzer waiting for me.
[02:05:25.320 --> 02:05:28.600]   I will see you next week. Now back to Devindra.
[02:05:29.960 --> 02:05:33.560]   Thanks, Leo. Now let's take a look at what else was going on on the Twit Network this week.
[02:05:33.560 --> 02:05:40.360]   Also here, I've got a card now that lists all his fine attributes, ladies and gentlemen.
[02:05:40.360 --> 02:05:46.040]   They've even laminated your introduction cards. I guess you're going to be around for a while.
[02:05:46.040 --> 02:05:47.560]   Someday I hope to have a card.
[02:05:47.560 --> 02:05:57.240]   That can be arranged previously on Twit. Twit news. Leo LaPorte here joining me. Rod Pyle
[02:05:57.240 --> 02:06:03.560]   host of this week in space, editor in chief of the Ad Astra magazine and a little boy who was so
[02:06:03.560 --> 02:06:11.720]   excited he had to get up at 4 a.m. today because we are going to see images from the James Webb
[02:06:11.720 --> 02:06:17.240]   telescope. There's your desktop wallpaper. That's a gas cloud around a dying star, half a light
[02:06:17.240 --> 02:06:24.520]   year in diameter, a thousand light years away. Mac Break Weekly. Wayne Ma interviewed, I guess,
[02:06:24.520 --> 02:06:29.400]   has a lot of sources, wrote a very interesting piece inside Apple's eight-year struggle
[02:06:29.400 --> 02:06:34.760]   to build a self-driving car. Interviews with 20 people who have worked on Apple's self-driving
[02:06:34.760 --> 02:06:39.560]   car project shed new light on its troubled effort to build a car that can drive itself.
[02:06:39.560 --> 02:06:47.000]   This week in Google, Twitter is suing Musk saying, "You said you're going to give us 44 billion and
[02:06:47.000 --> 02:06:52.920]   by God we want the 44 billion." This is an unusual and very specific type of picture contract claim.
[02:06:52.920 --> 02:06:57.880]   There are emojis involved. To it. Don't know if they've ever adjudicated a poop emoji before,
[02:06:57.880 --> 02:07:02.920]   but now they will. I've just been handed some laminated cards.
[02:07:02.920 --> 02:07:11.400]   Didn't that tell you to be before it ended? Catherine R. Gellis Esquire and Ant, we got one for you too.
[02:07:11.400 --> 02:07:21.320]   Good enough. Simple. It just says Ant. But I love it. You know, it's good. It's good. So now
[02:07:21.320 --> 02:07:27.400]   everybody's got laminated. Oh, that's so much fun. You know what, folks, another thing Apple's
[02:07:27.400 --> 02:07:32.360]   working on that we didn't even mention yet is AR glasses. There have been a lot of rumors around
[02:07:32.360 --> 02:07:37.400]   that. You know who's a great expert on that stuff is Norm Chan. Norm, you've looked at a
[02:07:37.400 --> 02:07:42.280]   couple things lately that could hint at what Apple's thinking about and where this entire
[02:07:42.280 --> 02:07:48.600]   market is going. You looked at the Mojo, is it Mojo, augmented reality glasses and hands-on with
[02:07:48.600 --> 02:07:53.000]   the tilt-five production AR glasses? I remember you talking about that while back. Can you give us a
[02:07:53.000 --> 02:07:57.000]   preview of your coverage with that stuff? Yeah, those are interesting devices. I think neither of
[02:07:57.000 --> 02:08:00.840]   those are exactly what Apple's going to be doing. They're first-generation AR glasses, probably
[02:08:00.840 --> 02:08:06.040]   akin to what, you know, Metas doing with their project camera, their glasses, some pass-through
[02:08:06.040 --> 02:08:10.440]   AR for productivity, get those in the hands of developers. We don't know when that is, but the
[02:08:10.440 --> 02:08:16.520]   two devices you mentioned that I got to check out recently at the augmented world Expo, our novel
[02:08:16.520 --> 02:08:24.200]   Uses of AR. One out in the world now in tilt-five and one far out into the future, probably.
[02:08:24.200 --> 02:08:28.920]   Tilt-fives, a company created by Jerry Ellsworth. She was previously at Valve. She's an amazing
[02:08:28.920 --> 02:08:35.800]   engineer. I've done a lot of awesome hacking with video game stuff in the past. And this company,
[02:08:35.800 --> 02:08:40.920]   a technology you should really been working on for a decade is AR glasses for tabletop gaming.
[02:08:40.920 --> 02:08:47.480]   So the idea is you wear these tilt-five glasses. They have Pico projectors built in, two of them,
[02:08:47.480 --> 02:08:52.440]   and they essentially represent imagery for your eye. But as opposed to blasting images into your
[02:08:52.440 --> 02:08:57.720]   eye, they blast out into the world and hit a retro-reflective surface. So this gameboard they
[02:08:57.720 --> 02:09:02.920]   have, that has tracking markers on the around the edge of it, but the material, this gram material,
[02:09:02.920 --> 02:09:07.000]   essentially, it's kind of the same material that maybe your stop sign that you see on the street
[02:09:07.640 --> 02:09:12.360]   is made out of. So when you shine light at it, it comes exactly back 180 degrees
[02:09:12.360 --> 02:09:17.560]   back into the light source. And so if you have the projector where your eyes are,
[02:09:17.560 --> 02:09:21.640]   they do a little bit of bouncing around the glasses, they go out toward the gameboard,
[02:09:21.640 --> 02:09:26.440]   and they come back at you, then you get stereo images that are augmented reality images.
[02:09:26.440 --> 02:09:29.560]   And they've worked with a bunch of developers over the past couple of years,
[02:09:30.360 --> 02:09:40.360]   video games, essentially your tabletop DND, your bomberman, marble madness, all sorts of
[02:09:40.360 --> 02:09:47.560]   those types of games. But you can play them asymmetrically around the table remotely,
[02:09:47.560 --> 02:09:50.280]   and the effect is really stunning. It's really fun.
[02:09:50.280 --> 02:09:56.280]   That's great. And does tilt-five work well even if you're wearing glasses? That's always the
[02:09:56.280 --> 02:09:59.000]   issue with me. I don't know if you were contacts to test these things, Norm.
[02:09:59.000 --> 02:10:05.160]   Yeah, yeah. For the video, I took off my glasses, but they're prototypes. It's because there's not
[02:10:05.160 --> 02:10:10.040]   perfect alignment needed with the headset and your head. You can very easily just put them on
[02:10:10.040 --> 02:10:16.280]   like big sunglasses, and they do work over even big glasses. And yeah, they've created some
[02:10:16.280 --> 02:10:21.880]   technology to generate like a third person view. So you can do like Twitch streaming while having
[02:10:21.880 --> 02:10:26.360]   some type of mixed reality view so people can see the dungeon you're crawling through.
[02:10:26.360 --> 02:10:31.480]   And that controller is really neat because it's a hybrid, almost like a We-Mote style,
[02:10:31.480 --> 02:10:38.600]   one, but on its side works as your standard gamepad. Really clever ideas, and their discord is
[02:10:38.600 --> 02:10:44.360]   full of amazing developers creating fun things using their SDK to use as they're shipping to
[02:10:44.360 --> 02:10:48.040]   Kickstarter backers. You know, I want to-
[02:10:48.040 --> 02:10:52.520]   You're a game developer. Yeah, go ahead. You sound amazed by this.
[02:10:52.520 --> 02:11:00.120]   Well, I'm interested in this. I've long thought that VR, the AR had a better chance to catch on
[02:11:00.120 --> 02:11:06.760]   than VR because from a game development point of view, you have to get so specialized when
[02:11:06.760 --> 02:11:11.480]   you're developing things for VR, like things like optimizing your draw calls from the center
[02:11:11.480 --> 02:11:17.000]   of the screen so you don't have nauseousness. Thinking about different movement paradigms is
[02:11:17.000 --> 02:11:24.600]   one of the reasons why it's so incredibly expensive to develop VR experiences, which is sad because
[02:11:24.600 --> 02:11:29.800]   there's very little of marketplace to actually sell games. Everything I'm seeing here in this
[02:11:29.800 --> 02:11:34.520]   video, Norman, tell me if I'm wrong here. This looks like it's being made with the Unity.
[02:11:34.520 --> 02:11:37.080]   Is that correct? Yeah, I believe so.
[02:11:37.080 --> 02:11:41.800]   Yeah. Oh, it's just a lower cost overall. Yeah.
[02:11:41.800 --> 02:11:45.960]   Yes, lower cost and lower performance overhead needed. They're doing a reprojection.
[02:11:46.600 --> 02:11:50.040]   Basically doubling up the frames or tripling them up in the headset itself.
[02:11:50.040 --> 02:11:56.440]   So the projectors are running at 180 hertz, but Jerry says that a lot of the developers
[02:11:56.440 --> 02:12:00.440]   don't even need to optimize as their first pass. They can run it at 30 or 60
[02:12:00.440 --> 02:12:07.240]   on Intel integrated graphics and it'll run smooth. The production units actually prove that out.
[02:12:07.240 --> 02:12:15.000]   Yeah, that's really interesting to me. You were talking at the beginning of this about how the
[02:12:15.000 --> 02:12:22.120]   signs are there that Apple is bringing a VR product to market AR product to market rather.
[02:12:22.120 --> 02:12:28.760]   And I just tell you, someone that works with their SDK, it's the writing is so on the wall
[02:12:28.760 --> 02:12:34.520]   because you don't look at Apple leaks. You ask yourself, like you follow the state of the union
[02:12:34.520 --> 02:12:40.440]   and see the direction that Apple has been going with basically their developer tools.
[02:12:40.440 --> 02:12:46.680]   It was not that long ago. The only thing you had was right kit for building games. And yeah,
[02:12:46.680 --> 02:12:51.240]   today you've got seeing kit in the 3D tools are far more sophisticated.
[02:12:51.240 --> 02:12:57.640]   I think most of us would agree the pipeline of Apple's vision of plugging powerful graphics
[02:12:57.640 --> 02:13:03.960]   cards into your Mac and connecting a monitor to it that time ended up being a technological dead end.
[02:13:03.960 --> 02:13:14.200]   But I see this and I just see a more tenable development pipeline to get it out there.
[02:13:14.200 --> 02:13:23.320]   And I think that's the really core problem. Magic leave, I think, failed. Not because the idea is bad,
[02:13:23.320 --> 02:13:31.160]   but despite all the money they spent on it, they didn't bother to develop something that
[02:13:31.160 --> 02:13:36.200]   you could, they did something better than what you would get on a screen.
[02:13:36.200 --> 02:13:44.280]   And I think if you're looking to sell hardware, you've got to be able to get developers to be
[02:13:44.280 --> 02:13:49.080]   able to work with it in a cost efficient way. And this just looks like a flat out better solution to me.
[02:13:49.080 --> 02:13:53.000]   Yeah. Can you tell us anything about the contact lenses too?
[02:13:53.000 --> 02:13:56.360]   Oh, yeah, yeah. And then one thing I'll lead off because you magically pronounce
[02:13:56.360 --> 02:14:00.280]   them actually two for a piece that was a month. And it's one of their big failures.
[02:14:00.280 --> 02:14:03.960]   September 30. Now, magically, it's right. It's right. It's right. It exists. It'll be September 30.
[02:14:03.960 --> 02:14:08.360]   It's for $32.99 if you really have that money you want to spend it. But go ahead, Norm.
[02:14:08.360 --> 02:14:13.240]   But they're smarter, I think magically now move shifting over to not consumers because they
[02:14:13.240 --> 02:14:18.360]   made had such a big push probably in the VC problem. It's so much money put into it that the expectation
[02:14:18.360 --> 02:14:22.600]   was that they would be a mass market consumer product and you had all these wired covered
[02:14:22.600 --> 02:14:27.720]   stories and they put all their money not necessarily into SDK or developed relations. And they did
[02:14:27.720 --> 02:14:35.000]   have that but into solving a fundamentally hard optical problem in trying to promise optics that
[02:14:35.000 --> 02:14:40.600]   would solve this conversion accommodation conflict. And from what I understand or what the assumption
[02:14:40.600 --> 02:14:43.720]   is going into whatever Apple's going to do is I don't think they're going to necessarily try
[02:14:43.720 --> 02:14:48.200]   to solve the optical problem. They might do a pass through solution, a pass through video solution,
[02:14:48.200 --> 02:14:53.080]   which is what Metas doing with their headset that they're hopefully announcing later this year.
[02:14:53.080 --> 02:14:57.480]   Apple does contact lenses. So this company called Mojo Vision and what they've done is they have
[02:14:57.480 --> 02:15:04.600]   a prototype, they say feature complete contact lens that has a 0.5 millimeter micro LED at the
[02:15:04.600 --> 02:15:13.000]   center of it. So it's a 280 pixels wide monochrome right now green color. But in that the contact
[02:15:13.000 --> 02:15:18.840]   lens they have this display as well as radio and most of it's actually battery on that PCB,
[02:15:18.840 --> 02:15:24.520]   which will then relay to essentially something you're wearing your neck like a relay for compute.
[02:15:24.520 --> 02:15:31.080]   So no heavy processing. That's all happens on this wearable but wirelessly they would transfer
[02:15:31.080 --> 02:15:37.640]   imagery with a user interface they designed. And the field of view is 15 degrees field of view.
[02:15:37.640 --> 02:15:41.800]   So they describe it as like a spotlight. And what I was able to try is a handheld version of it
[02:15:41.800 --> 02:15:47.480]   not plugged into my eye. But I think I could hold on a stick and then move it around. And as I
[02:15:47.480 --> 02:15:53.960]   moved it around, yeah, you could I could read text clearly in this you know, 280 pixel wide
[02:15:53.960 --> 02:16:00.680]   circle and kind of move it like a flashlight around to hover over icons. And it's not head look,
[02:16:00.680 --> 02:16:05.720]   it is really eye looking because it's on a contact lens. So as I move my eye around, as
[02:16:05.720 --> 02:16:10.280]   the person who be wearing this would move our eye around, it would be tracking them with an IMU
[02:16:10.280 --> 02:16:16.840]   in the contact lens itself. That's pretty well. I don't know. It's a contact lens where
[02:16:16.840 --> 02:16:25.640]   you get you get so attached to certain brands because they're softer or cleaner or even disposable
[02:16:25.640 --> 02:16:31.240]   lenses that something like that. And you think about things going wrong and having electrical
[02:16:31.240 --> 02:16:37.160]   components near your eye. I'm just you don't want your contact lenses to overheat or explode.
[02:16:38.440 --> 02:16:44.440]   Yeah, I just I'm not doing it. I'm sorry. That is absolutely that's how I feel about it too.
[02:16:44.440 --> 02:16:48.520]   Exactly. I don't wear glasses. I don't like putting things in my eye. I've heard horror stories.
[02:16:48.520 --> 02:16:53.240]   You know, my wife's had contact lenses rolled to the back of her eye. So presumably these are
[02:16:53.240 --> 02:16:57.960]   yeah. Oh, it just sounds like I don't want that to happen. It's wireless here. So like,
[02:16:57.960 --> 02:17:02.440]   how would you fish that out? And there's like whole cleanliness of it, right? Like this isn't
[02:17:02.440 --> 02:17:06.040]   going to be disposable. Presumably whenever they guess this gets the market, it'll be
[02:17:06.040 --> 02:17:11.080]   expensive custom fit for your eyeball. So it's you know, it's going to I know glass
[02:17:11.080 --> 02:17:15.000]   consequences in the past that irritability. So yeah, I'm not sure exactly.
[02:17:15.000 --> 02:17:22.520]   I have to ask Norm, I saw this when they first went public back in like 2020 at CES or CES 2020.
[02:17:22.520 --> 02:17:27.000]   And one of the things they were talking about a lot was the idea that folks with low vision
[02:17:27.000 --> 02:17:32.840]   or vision impairment, they were working on solutions to help people to sort of augment or
[02:17:32.840 --> 02:17:38.520]   create the, you know, the ability to see better, or at least to be able to discern objects and
[02:17:38.520 --> 02:17:42.360]   rooms and stuff. Are they talking about that at all? Or is it almost kind of entirely
[02:17:42.360 --> 02:17:47.000]   a heads up display conversation from them now? I think for I think it's a head that's a display
[02:17:47.000 --> 02:17:50.680]   because it's fundamentally they're using the same types of contact lenses on their outer and
[02:17:50.680 --> 02:17:57.960]   inner shell. They can do corrective lensing. So you can people could wear it as a contact lens.
[02:17:57.960 --> 02:18:02.360]   But from I think their business purpose, they want this to be for medical fields,
[02:18:02.360 --> 02:18:07.560]   probably military, wherever people would have their hands busy, but need to have some type of
[02:18:07.560 --> 02:18:14.120]   heads up information. And the user interface aspect of it is really interesting because even though
[02:18:14.120 --> 02:18:19.320]   even as fast as our eye tracking might be and as responsive as it might be, like imagine if you
[02:18:19.320 --> 02:18:25.480]   had a full UI, but you could only see a circle of it at once, like you would need some type of
[02:18:25.480 --> 02:18:32.040]   indicator of when information was being updated in the periphery, or be extremely familiar with that
[02:18:32.040 --> 02:18:37.960]   UI to not, you know, I don't want to have to mouse over or look over to notice that there's a
[02:18:37.960 --> 02:18:42.840]   icon in this right corner or left corner, which is kind of how they're designing it right now.
[02:18:42.840 --> 02:18:51.080]   I will say the smart contact lenses in the new Batman movie is like the one thing that really
[02:18:51.080 --> 02:18:56.520]   irked me about that movie. It's like you have some contact lenses recording video. How's this
[02:18:56.520 --> 02:19:03.320]   working Batman? Where's it being stored? What's charging it? I'm kind of right there with you
[02:19:03.320 --> 02:19:08.600]   to norm. Like the the ickiness of it, I've never gotten contacts just because I think early on,
[02:19:08.600 --> 02:19:13.560]   I think I have a stigmatism and it was hard to get contacts to work with that. Now they work and
[02:19:13.560 --> 02:19:17.240]   I'm just like too grossed out by the idea. But I also test enough of your headsets where I'm like,
[02:19:19.080 --> 02:19:23.480]   am I going to get contacts just to better test VR headsets? Because I guess I have to,
[02:19:23.480 --> 02:19:27.560]   because it's the world we're living in? I don't know. Thankfully some have glasses in
[02:19:27.560 --> 02:19:34.520]   suit, so I've been able to use those. Yeah, I think there's one more story I want to dive into
[02:19:34.520 --> 02:19:42.680]   real quick because we are rounding the end here. But FCC chair Jessica Rosenworzel announced she
[02:19:42.680 --> 02:19:49.160]   is aiming to increase the broadband standard in the US from 25 megabits per second download to 100
[02:19:49.160 --> 02:19:55.160]   and upload from 3 megabits per second to 20 megabits. Just want to hear quick thoughts guys and
[02:19:55.160 --> 02:20:00.280]   bring on especially too because you're actually working in the political sphere to kind of see
[02:20:00.280 --> 02:20:05.800]   how this thing would work or would it even ever pass? I mean, this is why a lot of why I wanted to
[02:20:05.800 --> 02:20:11.320]   run for Congress is the Science, Space and Technology Committee in the House is just
[02:20:11.320 --> 02:20:17.320]   criminally serving on their own. Look at their qualifications, the people making your tech policy
[02:20:17.320 --> 02:20:23.240]   in the United States. It's a joke. He read this, it's like, yes, of course, we've got to do this.
[02:20:23.240 --> 02:20:30.760]   The question is if our broadband duopoly is actually going to, are they going to fight it in
[02:20:30.760 --> 02:20:35.640]   court? Are they going to fudge it? We've seen so many false promises about this,
[02:20:36.680 --> 02:20:41.560]   just up and down the line, like I could get in here and talk about AT&T and Verizon,
[02:20:41.560 --> 02:20:47.240]   their false promises when they get dragged before Senate subcommittee about not screwing over
[02:20:47.240 --> 02:20:55.640]   consumers so hard. I want to see this, obviously do it, make it happen. There's no reason for us to have
[02:20:55.640 --> 02:21:02.120]   this level of terrible internet with what we pay for it in the United States, which is remarkably
[02:21:02.120 --> 02:21:06.760]   more expensive than other countries mandate is the only way it's going to get better.
[02:21:06.760 --> 02:21:10.760]   Absolutely. Is that enough speed for you guys, Patrick and Norm?
[02:21:10.760 --> 02:21:21.080]   It's a bare minimum. Well, Norm, you're producing a full video every day, I think. So, yeah, you need
[02:21:21.080 --> 02:21:25.880]   a lot, but yeah, go ahead, Patrick. No, I was going to say, it was one of the interesting things
[02:21:25.880 --> 02:21:31.000]   about traveling around RVing before we settled in St. Louis was seeing, we would look at towns and
[02:21:31.000 --> 02:21:37.560]   be like, "Oh, they have DSL within a finite distance of a particular switch." It was amazing to see
[02:21:37.560 --> 02:21:43.480]   there were some wireless, over-the-air wireless plans, like the one I left California. It was
[02:21:43.480 --> 02:21:48.520]   funny because there was a startup, they did, their first group was in my town, I lived in an
[02:21:48.520 --> 02:21:52.200]   Alameda, and I was like, "Gosh, I don't know. Should I trust this?" I was like, "Okay, I promised
[02:21:52.200 --> 02:21:58.920]   myself as soon as anybody had a better deal than Comcast, I was gone." I was trying to think of
[02:21:58.920 --> 02:22:03.400]   a single reason to stay with Comcast, and the only reason I could come up with was this company
[02:22:03.400 --> 02:22:10.760]   could not deliver any internet. It was amazing because I went from like 70-ish up on the promise
[02:22:10.760 --> 02:22:20.760]   to 100 and three to eight up, and like 70 to 100 down and a cap and complaints to unlimited data,
[02:22:20.760 --> 02:22:27.160]   symmetrical speeds, considerably better speeds, and I think a 40% cut in the cost. That company
[02:22:27.160 --> 02:22:31.160]   went out of business, but other things have come up, and it's been amazing for me to see,
[02:22:31.160 --> 02:22:35.160]   I can totally see, they're going to fight this tooth and nail 20 megabits up. That's
[02:22:35.160 --> 02:22:41.000]   ridiculous. We only give people a fraction of that now, and they're miserable, but they're still
[02:22:41.000 --> 02:22:47.880]   paying us. Why should we change? Or maybe Comcast, I just remember like Comcast going to do a merger,
[02:22:47.880 --> 02:22:56.440]   the call for response on that, they just got their asses kicked so hard. People who never get
[02:22:56.440 --> 02:23:02.680]   political are like basically calling their local congress critters to just talk smack on Comcast.
[02:23:02.680 --> 02:23:07.000]   And so, yeah, should they do that? They absolutely should. But they should also
[02:23:07.000 --> 02:23:10.440]   figure out ways of making this actually happen in the real world.
[02:23:10.440 --> 02:23:15.880]   For sure. And also kill the bandwidth caps, which is something criminal. I personally think
[02:23:15.880 --> 02:23:19.640]   it's criminal that Comcast is doing, and it's affected my parents and a lot of people I know.
[02:23:20.440 --> 02:23:27.960]   2022. I don't know how a home ISP could be basically installing caps on people when we know how the
[02:23:27.960 --> 02:23:33.320]   internet works. Everybody's streaming video, none of this makes any sense, folks. Norm, any
[02:23:33.320 --> 02:23:39.240]   any thoughts about this before we wrap? It's a bipartisan issue, right? There's need to be
[02:23:39.240 --> 02:23:43.880]   better messaging, and I know momentum is tough, and people are fixing their ways, and the bundles
[02:23:43.880 --> 02:23:48.200]   make it tougher, and there's a lot of lobbying, but no one likes the big broadband providers.
[02:23:49.080 --> 02:23:51.160]   And we're lucky to. Yeah, nobody loves them.
[02:23:51.160 --> 02:23:51.880]   And yeah.
[02:23:51.880 --> 02:23:55.560]   Can I add one quick thing onto that?
[02:23:55.560 --> 02:23:55.960]   Okay. Yeah.
[02:23:55.960 --> 02:24:04.440]   We're just saying, Norm, and look up how much money Comcast spends on lobbying Congress to get
[02:24:04.440 --> 02:24:10.680]   the regulation. They want no, it's not amazing. It's not amazing. It is so little money.
[02:24:10.680 --> 02:24:11.720]   It may be so.
[02:24:11.720 --> 02:24:13.000]   That's why it's amazing.
[02:24:13.000 --> 02:24:19.800]   Looking into this. Yes. I always want all techies to get together, because we can match.
[02:24:19.800 --> 02:24:25.560]   Like, I feel if you got every techy in the universe together, we can give some of these people
[02:24:25.560 --> 02:24:30.280]   their $10,000 that they want to pass terrible regulation on this.
[02:24:30.280 --> 02:24:31.400]   Quick pack. Let's go.
[02:24:31.400 --> 02:24:33.000]   Let's go with the quick pack.
[02:24:33.000 --> 02:24:35.160]   Nerd pack. Nerd pack.
[02:24:35.160 --> 02:24:40.120]   Nerd pack. Okay. Well, we have to wrap for this weekend, but folks, thank you all for joining me.
[02:24:40.120 --> 02:24:43.560]   Brianna Wu, where can people find you on the internet these days?
[02:24:43.560 --> 02:24:49.560]   You can see me on my exciting and fun Twitter account, which is always full of adventure at Brianna.
[02:24:49.560 --> 02:24:54.760]   You'll see portions. You'll see pinballs. You'll see fights at the Libertarian Party.
[02:24:54.760 --> 02:24:56.360]   It is a beautiful place to be.
[02:24:56.360 --> 02:25:00.600]   I think I also saw some bad Terminator takes there too, but we'll take that to Twitter.
[02:25:00.600 --> 02:25:05.480]   Terminator thing is underrated. It is.
[02:25:05.480 --> 02:25:09.240]   Cry me in the low. Good is great. Come on. She is good. She is good, but not better than
[02:25:09.240 --> 02:25:13.160]   Terminator 2. Patrick Norton, where can we find you on the internet these days?
[02:25:13.160 --> 02:25:17.800]   Oh my goodness. Twitter.com/patron Norton is always good.
[02:25:17.800 --> 02:25:22.520]   Or if you're into home theater, audio headphones, all that good stuff, go to AVXL,
[02:25:22.520 --> 02:25:27.800]   A-V-E-X-C-E-L on your favorite podcatcher. It's a weekly podcast. I host Robert Herron talking
[02:25:27.800 --> 02:25:31.000]   about home theater and audio and speakers and music and all that good stuff.
[02:25:31.000 --> 02:25:35.240]   I always appreciate hearing you guys, Nerd out, Patrick, and your voice is so soothing to
[02:25:35.240 --> 02:25:41.160]   me. It is a thing. I'm just listening to Patrick Talks Bex now, and it is fun. It's very relaxing.
[02:25:41.160 --> 02:25:43.320]   Norm Chan. I am honored. Where can people find you?
[02:25:43.320 --> 02:25:49.800]   Twitter as well @enchan. We do videos basically once a day at youtube.com/tested.
[02:25:49.800 --> 02:25:58.840]   All right, folks. You can watch and listen to Twitch every Sunday at 2.15pmpacifictime@twit.tv/twit.
[02:25:58.840 --> 02:26:01.960]   That's our show page. Another Twitch is in the can.
[02:26:01.960 --> 02:26:02.840]   Easy.
