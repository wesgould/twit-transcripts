[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   This is Twit this week in Tech, Episode 36 for January 1, 2006.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   [Music]
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   Here we are once again all gathered, well some of us, a couple of us gathered together
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   for the first show of 2006.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   Let me introduce the people at the panel.
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   And just say right up front, Patrick Norton couldn't make it because it's raining too hard.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   Kevin Rose couldn't make it because he left his lights on.
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   But Robert Herron undaunted by the weather or auto mechanical difficulties he's here.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   I rely on my Nissan.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   How things going on DLTV going well?
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:00:59.000]   Good, busy.
[00:00:59.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   We're prepping for CES.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   Are you going to do shows down there?
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   Yeah, we're actually going to stream a live show.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   I believe that's the current plan anyway, so we'll be doing that.
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   Starts in just a couple of days.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   When do you go down Sunday?
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   This is Austin.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Actually, I'm taking off, I think, Wednesday morning.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Oh, you don't have to get down there that early then.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   No.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   The show officially opens on Thursday, so I get down there a day before for the...
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   Party is...
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   Some of the pre-events too.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   There's actually press events starting Wednesday morning, so I'll be going nonstop till Saturday night and then leave Sunday.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   A man who is proud to say he actually says it every year, he's not going to CES, but will end up going no down.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   No, I will not.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   John C. de Vorak at de Vorak.org/blog.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   Why not?
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Well, you know, before a Comdex folded, I would go to CES about once every five years.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   I think it's more fun than Comdex though.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   Oh, it always has been, but I would go once every five years because you got to see everything and then you go...
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   You know, nothing really changed that fast at this show.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   And now of course it's absorbed some of the Comdex stuff, but it's still to me basically CES, which is a show you have to go to once every five years.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   So they're going year after year to this show, which is a miserable show.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   It's too big.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   It's too big, yeah.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   It's hard to get around everything. It's hard to see everything or even see what you want to see.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   There's too many, like, side events that keep you, you know, busy.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   You collect way too many cards or far too many as it were.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   For far too many cards that you can never follow up, everybody you meet at this show, they say,
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   "Oh yeah, now I'll do this. I'll do that."
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   So you rely on them.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   They never follow through.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   None of the PR people follow through at this show ever.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   And I'm talking about 10 or 15 years ago into this show or 20 even.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   They never follow up, so the whole show is a complete waste of time as far as I'm concerned.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   The other thing is nowadays that I'm boring everyone's stiff.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   Boy, it's right, grumpy.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   The other thing about the show is it's over-covered.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   So what am I doing there?
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Right.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   I think I'm going to go to... I like to dig stuff that people aren't, you know...
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   You can read it online.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   I think with the internet trade shows are a silly thing in the beginning.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   Well, the little ones that don't get a lot of coverage are worth going to because you find things out there.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   It's always been really about seeing people and socializing.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Don't you think that's really what it is?
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   There is a social thing involved in.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Comdex used to fill that bill.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   CES doesn't have quite the concentrate.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   I mean, they have a lot of techy guys going, especially since they're folding a Comdex.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   But it doesn't have the intense concentration of techies that Comdex had, where everybody was in the same business.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   This thing has spread a little thin with too many car stereo speakers, chrome rims, strange phones.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   I mean, all kinds of weird stuff that they've got nothing to do with me.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   Right.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   On the right...
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Aren't you glad you asked?
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   I am so glad.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   On the right hand side of the table, the right wing we call them, of course, Alex Pixel from Lindsay Core.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   Alex Lindsay from the Pixel Core.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   Who can't take off his hat today.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   I...
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   You know, once you put the hat on, you're going to put it on backwards.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   No, I don't wear caps for that very reason.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   This is why, by the way, this is why.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Okay, put it on, put it on.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   That's what he's doing here.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Put it on.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Nice plane to the camera.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   You don't know how badly it was raining outside, folks, but it was...
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   Monsoon-a.
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   The huge.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   The huge.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   And we also want to introduce a new member of the panel who's actually been in here behind the camera
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   as a number of times.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Kenji Kato is a cateau or cateau, sorry.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   I was thinking of Kato, the green hornet's...
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   He's among other things.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   He's a Pixel Core member, but also the center for homeland defense and security.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Can you imagine?
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   The CFHDAS.
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Uh-huh.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   I feel safer.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   Kenji, good to have you on the Twit panel today.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Could be a target.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   So, we'll talk a little bit about the news of the day, but also towards the end, you could start preparing.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   I want to talk a little bit about what's ahead for 2006.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   This is our first episode of the new year.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   And the...
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   What?
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   What's the worst of work?
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   I don't know what's ahead.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   No one knows what's ahead.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   You know what I'm reading?
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   You know what I'm reading?
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   That I'm really enjoying and you're going to mock me for this.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Ray Kurzweil's new book, The Singularity.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   The Singularity is near.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   What singularity?
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   I'll do a quick synopsis of this, which will probably not be as good as it could be.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   It's a long, thick book.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   And Ray, you know, Ray, for those who don't know, is an expert in artificial intelligences,
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   a very smart man, created a synthesizer for Stevie Wonder, speech systems, speech synthesis
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   systems, a recognition systems, and wrote a couple of books on the spiritual machines,
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   the age of spiritual machines, the age of intelligent machines.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   And his new one, the premise of a number of his books, besides the fact that he doesn't
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   ever want to die, which I think taunts him a little bit.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   But the premise of this book, and really of both of his machines' books, is that there's
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   a singularity on its way.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   And he day now, in the next couple of decades, where machines become as smart as humans,
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   and then start designing themselves.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   They have no motivation.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   And then...
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   No motivation.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Well, we tell them to.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   They do what you tell them.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   You have motivation when somebody slams a hammer into your hand.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   You can't do that.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   So he's ripping off the 20-year-old Terminator story with Sky Day.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   It's kind of like that.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   Well, I mean, you know, it's been in science fiction for ages, but he says we're at the
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   knee of the exponential curve, which now you got to admit, the rate of change has increased
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   considerably.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   So did you actually read this thing?
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   I'm reading it right now.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   It's pretty good.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   You're actually reading it.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   It's actually quite entertaining.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   You know, I have to...
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   Well, you and I interviewed Ray when the Age of Spiritual Machines came out.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   I think so, yeah.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   Yeah, and big thinkers.
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   And we tried...
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   I mean, I used what he calls in his book...
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   One thing he's done in his book, and I had a whole section on arguments against me.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   And he calls my argument the ontological argument, which is that there is something ineffable
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   that's in a human being that no machine could ever duplicate.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   And maybe it's motivation, maybe it's spirit or soul, I don't know.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   But there's also a function called life that's somewhat...
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   Life seems to me that way.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   But he says it doesn't matter.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   When these machines are indistinguishable from humans, but the main thing is once they start
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   designing themselves, these things go very fast.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   He says it's just evolution.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   It's like they're him and the Bill Joy at the bar, you know, back in Aspen, wherever it
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   was, and they're talking about how they're both worried, sick over robots taking over
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   the world.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   And nano machines turning the earth into a gob of goop because they get out of the globe.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   And I wrote about this in Forbes some years ago, and I said, you know, worms, you know,
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   worms have been trying to do this for eons, but unsuccessful.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   But they're not evolving as fast as nano tech will.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   I think the people vastly, artificial...
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   I've worked with a couple people who do a lot of artificial intelligence.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   I think they vastly underestimate the human brain when they think it's going to match.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   I mean, maybe someday, but I think this century I would be surprised.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   I don't know.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   Some of the people...
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   I've no doubt that the machines are going to keep on working.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   Well, they do, yeah.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   But I think they...
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   They don't take out a good half of the population.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   You know, it's...
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   I've already had.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   They already have taken out a good half, but the half they've taken out are secretaries,
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   people who did hand copy...
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   Kill confrontiates.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   Oh, please, for manufacturing, though, that...
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Manufacturers...
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Robots were a must for that industry.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   I used to work in manufacturing, and it was...
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   Ten hours a day to work in...
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   How smart can these machines be if they work so cheap?
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   They're smart.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Make up at it.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   One of the smarts he says to reassure you, and this actually made me laugh at Laudel.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   I'm reading the book.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   That's why I'm reading it, because it's humorous.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   Machines will revere us as their biological progenitors.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   Oh, this is...
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   We just...
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   We don't have to worry about one now, because there are two hours we're still thinking.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   You want us to be worshiped by someone.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   He also talks about what we're integration in the book.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   Right.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   And that's key.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   More and more hardware integration in human beings that will be chipped at some point.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Well, and this is where...
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   This is where...
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   That's possible.
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   I'd really like an address book and an image recognition that will tell me who's name of the person that's standing across.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   All of that.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   All of that.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   Well, I'd be about that in the research labs.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   Why?
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   Because I'm always forgetting.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   So what?
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   Just thank you.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   I prefer...
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   He's named John C. de Vorex.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   Oh, he has three children.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   He has three children.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   Hey, I haven't seen him in his first days.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   So long time, here's the trick that I was using.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   Read one of those names.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   I meet too many people, so I can't remember half of them.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   I owe... and I hate to be given this trick away on the air, but you know, just between us and it's only a podcast.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   You go and say, "Hey, how you doing?
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   I haven't seen...
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   Hey, give me your new card before I forget to ask."
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   Because everyone always has a new card, right?
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   I'm a good razzer.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   They always have a new flatter.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   And they're all flatter.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   Yeah, because I want to get the card right now.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   So they give me the new card.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   And I say, "Oh, that's so and so on."
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   When I go with my fiance, the rule is mostly that I'm very good at introducing myself.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   I'm going to ruin this thing.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   I'm doing the same thing.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   I'm very good at introducing myself.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   If I don't introduce you, I don't know their name.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   And then so she knows to jump...
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   She just jumps out here and I go, "Oh, I'm sorry."
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   No, I've told my wife that.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   Sometimes you can slip in there.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   You say, "Hey, you guys shouldn't be.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   Why don't you introduce each other?"
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   That's obvious.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   Is it?
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   You think so?
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   And what happens when the PR guy says, "Oh, I'm out of cards, John."
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   Then what do you do?
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   Well, here's the...
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   PR guy never says that.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   It's never happened in history.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   And in fact, I think it's illegal.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.720]   Anyway, the thing that's the real one that's a problem, and it happens to me because I always
[00:09:53.720 --> 00:09:57.000]   wear phony badges that don't have my name on them, just as a joke.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   And people say, "Hey, how you doing?"
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   And the guy recognizes me and he looks down.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   Hey, Sally.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   Hey, Alice, how you doing?
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   I know, and in this thing, in this thing, I'm gonna get a clue back.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   Gotcha.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   Gotcha.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   You have no idea who I am.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   So we'll talk some more about CES a little bit, because it does start this week and I don't
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   know, maybe there is something to look for to.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   I'm sure Robert has some TV.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   I'm excited.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   HDTV stuff.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   Have you been to CES before?
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   Many times.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   Oh, of course he is.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   It's awesome.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   How do you be excited?
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   That's the question.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   You know what?
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   It's a challenge.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   It's like four days of just nonstop grind, and it's an opportunity for me just to meet and
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   greet all the companies that are basically cramming about two, three months of meetings
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   in the four days.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   Don't you always feel like crap, though, when you're afterwards, when you're now?
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   It's very, very sick every time.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   As soon as I step on that plane to come back, though, it's just like, "Ah, I'll just feel
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   that bad that I shouldn't have seen my office instead of going around in Vegas, seriously."
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   So are you gonna clean your office this week?
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   Yep.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   It'll be clean as a whistle by the end of the week.
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   I want to see pictures in the vlog.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   He's gonna find a corner and take a picture.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   Any TV developments you're expecting at CES is your rubber?
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   Thin flat, 1080p.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   1080p.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   Those will be the three main things.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   But is there any 1080p programming?
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   Is it gonna be 1920?
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   1080p?
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   That's what 1080p is.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   Yeah, okay.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   Well, 1920 by 1080 pixels per person.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   You could do a worse one.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   Yeah, you could do a worse one as long as the 1080p.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   He is part of it, right?
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   Well, that's the thing that says it's a revolutionary.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:18.000]   The resolution of 1080p.
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.000]   The resolution of a physical resolution, though, it's 1920 by 1080p.
[00:11:19.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   It wouldn't be that is the format that is 1080p.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   It wouldn't be 16 by 1080p.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   Am I missing a show?
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   It wouldn't be 16 by 9.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   No, I think it's 12, 80 by 1080.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   But then it wouldn't be...
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   That's what it is.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   It's 4.3.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   That's what it was.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   I'm sorry I brought it up.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   Actually, some of the plasma companies are finally catching up with the LCD people in terms of catching up to that 1080p resolution.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   Also, the plasma's like the resolution is crummy.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   The 42 inch has been the biggest complaint of mine in the last year in that none of them are true high definition devices.
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   They're all like 1024 by 760.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   And they're just cutting off resolution.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   And you actually can see it and measure it.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   So when is the 1920 1080p plasma coming up?
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   Panasonic announced two already in Japan, 65 inch to 10.
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   And they sell for what?
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   Supposedly that 1080p from Panasonic was coming to the US this year for $10,000, which...
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   Well, come on.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   It's always the number.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   It seems to be...
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   No, no, but any new TV.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   A 65 inch build?
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   It's always $10,000.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   At the same resolution as $20,000.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   So you're talking...
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   If the plasma guys can get that display out, that's half price.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   You're going to buy one?
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   Half price.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   I need any TV.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   Why plasma?
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   I have money.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   Why plasma screens instead of a projector?
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   See, I love front projectors.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   Absolutely favorite.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   I use projector.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   I use projector.
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   We're not talking rear projection.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   We're talking the front projection.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   The projection is going to die.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   It's the US's...
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   Yeah, I use it.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   We're not buying rear projection at this point just because we need the big TVs and it's the cheapest way to go where you want a huge screen.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   For me, more important than even resolution is the video processing on the back end.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   That will take your standard definition content.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   You're still watching your DVDs, your regular NTSC television.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   The ferrusia chip or whatever it is.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   Yeah, and actually there's a company called...
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   It's Fruigia still the best?
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   No.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   There's a company called Tarenix.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   They make a processor called the HQV processor.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   I hope I got that.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   Either it's backwards.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   Either it's the company's HQV, Hollywood quality video.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   No, that sounds right.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   Terrible...
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   Yeah, I think you're right.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   They have an amazing video processor.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   It's based off of some military signal processing technology that's now...
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   But Fruigia is bought out.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   Oh, were they?
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   They're not even...
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   There are so many mergers in that area recently.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   But these guys are...
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   Arguably one of the best chips out there right now.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   What about your use?
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   The cheapest devices are like $3,500 just for applause.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   How about just a little triple or a line doubler that like to Samsung?
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   Samsung has a 720p DVD player.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   It seems to do a really nice job.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   Yeah, I use that one.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   That's great.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   I run into more problems with those up converting players.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   Either it breaks the 3.2 pull down for converting 24 frame material, film based material into TV, 30 frames per second.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   When you... like I have a $1,500 Denon up scaling DVD player.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   At 720p it starts screwing up that cadence and causing all sorts of weird artifacts.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   But if I move to the 1080i for some reason, most TVs look great.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   And it somehow restores that proper 3.2 pull down.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   It's not getting too far into the 60s discussion.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   But what other...
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   I know I asked him what was going to be cool at CDN.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   Yes, he says it.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   TV's well very enthusiastic listening to this.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   I'm excited.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   Better video processors, cheaper, flatter, bigger.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   That's the big thing.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   We're going to see some new players.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   Are they going to announce the little... isn't there going to be an HD like little pod player?
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   It's not really HD.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   It's like 960 by 540.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   I river one.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   I river is going to make an HD.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   Is it I river one?
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   I think I river one.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   There's a company that's working on one that's supposed to be like 960.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   It's got like a 40 gig drive.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   You want to watch something that's...
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   Actually, I river already has that DVD resolution and one that's got like a 7 inch screen on it with a 100 gig hard drive inside for about 7,800 bucks.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   But just expensive.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   I got 120 or 1280 by...
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   Yeah, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70, 70,
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   Yeah, I'm just 17.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   So the big story of the week Intel is dropping the Intel inside.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   They're changing the logo and the new tagline is leap ahead.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   Yeah, leap ahead.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   Yeah, you remember that 19... excuse me, the commercial 1985 after the 1984.
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   Oh, yeah, yeah.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   I'm not sure they leap ahead.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   Yeah, that was it off the cliff.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   Yeah, that's what they're doing.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   So, and you said they're dropping the Pentium too.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   Well, they're going to drop the demonic name.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   Right now, and then they're going to...
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   The first thing they're going to do is they're going to switch the Pentium M name to the core name.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   The core?
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   Yeah, and I...
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   Like the Marine core?
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   The C-O-R-E and it's going to be the core, solo and core, dual, so it's kind of a reverse and dual core.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   But my thinking is it still has to do with Apple, so the Apple can use Apple Core.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   Yeah, Apple Core.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   Yeah, you're going to see your...
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   No, but Apple...
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   The B-O-R-P-S, this is C-O-R-E, which is what an Apple Core should be spelled like.
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   Should be.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   So, they're going to have that as...
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   So, it's going to be Apple Core, and this is going to be...
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   I know you're joking, but in fact, I think the fact that Intel's doing this at CES, the week before Mac World-E is maybe an indicator that...
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   Yeah, they're going to...
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   They want to do their rebranding now before Apple comes out.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   It's very prominent.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   Steve will come today.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   Oh, and one more thing.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   Well, I'm really curious to see whether...
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   I think a lot of people have been talking about this online, but whether Apple's going to do anything that really...
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   ...puts a lot of Intel branding on the machines.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   I think the whole Intel inside thing was not going to happen.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.000]   But they might do...
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   But leap ahead, mate.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   You wonder whether that's somehow connected.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   Think a leap ahead, leap different?
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   Apple Core.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   The other thing is that Intel's...
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   You know about the vibe.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   Vibe.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   Well, that's the media chip set that they actually are saying Apple is.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   I think if you go on there on their web...
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   I'd be.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   They never mentioned Microsoft and the cool media center that they've got in the Xbox.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   And there's a feud going on.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   And by the way, I have this prediction that when Vibe dies, they're going to bring it back and call it Revive.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:48.000]   (laughter)
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   Okay, that's two.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   I'm just marking them down.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   That's actually been a huge bone of contention between Intel and Microsoft for a long time.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   Is that Intel is constantly trying to put added benefits into their chip sets to differentiate their hardware?
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   Microsoft wouldn't write to it.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:03.000]   They wouldn't take advantage of it.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   It was back to Andy Grove.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   I remember we were setting up for an interview with Andy Grove.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   I don't even know his tech TV.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   It might have been the site.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   And he went off before the cameras were on Microsoft.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   And they've always been...
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   Because they do 64 or 32-bit chips and Microsoft's still doing a 16-bit OS.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   They do 64-bit chips.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   Microsoft's still doing a 32-bit OS.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   I mean, it's always been that way.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   You know, there's another thing that's not well publicized, but for a long time, Bill himself held huge shares of AMD.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   Interesting.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   Yeah, it's a little known fact.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   Is that like a hedge fund, kind of the personal Bill Gates hedge fund?
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   Well, you know that...
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   Remember when AMD had that one special Windows-only chip or something?
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   It was all part of that thing.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   And I think he's always liked AMD's stuff.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   Oh, who wouldn't?
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   What's not polite?
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   That's true.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   But generally speaking, I don't think it pleased Intel by any means that he would own...
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   That's the desktop PC right now, is AMD-based.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   But I have to say, I mean, from...
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   I'm excited about Yona.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   I think the dual cores are looking pretty good.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   I think that that's going to be a good set.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   Most people believe that Intel is two solid years behind AMD in dual-corp technology and just...
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   Well, but AMD has yet got to show us if that's the case.
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:20.000]   But Intel has their new Silicon laser technology, which is what is going to allow them to do smaller, basically chip sizes.
[00:18:20.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   I mean, they can get down to the smaller nanometer size much quicker with the Silicon laser technology.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   That gives you an answer.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   Like a light processor?
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   The problem with that is that, yeah, that sounds good on paper.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   But in fact, the entire chip semiconductor business is not one company with one little technology,
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   but it's the entire industry deciding that they're going to move to whatever, you know, was...
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   Why do you say that?
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   Why can't Intel...
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   Because if you go into one of the fabs, and you'll see there's like 40 different companies...
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   Oh, Intel has their own fabs?
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   No, I'm talking about the fab that has the conveyor belt, the fab that chops the chip, the fab that burns the chip...
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   Does it build its own?
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   No, no, most of this stuff is from the...
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   From the second part...
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   It applied to, you know, what's applied materials and all these...
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   About 10 major Japanese companies, Nikon, everybody.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   I mean, it's basically all pieced together.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   They have one or two proprietary elements on their line.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   But for the most part, it's all CMOS stuff that's done by a huge industry of makers.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   Intel doesn't build any of that gear.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   One of the companies is out in Montana, if I'm not mistaken.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   And it actually builds the processing lines and the system that actually...
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   That he's used by Intel and some of the other companies.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   I've got one for Kenji Kato, who is working once again for the...
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   What do you do for the Center for Homeland Defense?
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   What does technology and media manage?
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   That's not a Homeland Defense.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   No, what we are is we're a group that actually does a training program basically for state and local,
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   for firefighters, for governors, for executives, who are making decisions about things from...
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   How do you deal with a natural disaster?
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   To how do you deal with a terrorist event?
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   You didn't make the one that Governor Blanco used in Louisiana.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   No, no, no.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   It's going to be okay.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   Yeah, well, what's funny is that we actually look at those kind of things in the center.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   And we have different professors at the Nable Postgraduate School where we're based.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   And they actually look at different things they've gone on and actually try to put together best policies and practices,
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   which we then teach the students.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   And it's actually free for all of our students.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   They get...
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   They can come into the program.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   It's free.

[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   Microsoft hasn't really responded.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   I'm sure they'll do a patch, but the question is will they wait until patch Tuesday?
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   I have actually a question related.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:13.760]   Now, how have you guys heard the rumors related to Apple being able to run Windows applications
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:14.760]   in the new OS?
[00:30:14.760 --> 00:30:16.000]   Oh, is there a rumor circulating?
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   It's building.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   It's kind of the wine type thing where there's a bunch of patents that came out.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   This is what I've been begging for.
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   It's not running virtual PC or anything.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.700]   It's not dual boot.
[00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:32.080]   It's literally just opening the application in OS 10 as if it was in OS 10.
[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:33.080]   It does that now with X-Window.
[00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:35.560]   I mean, they learn how to do that with X-Windows very early on.
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:36.560]   It's called seamless.
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:40.480]   Well, that assumes that they have the code that Microsoft uses to make these things work
[00:30:40.480 --> 00:30:41.480]   in the first place.
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:44.400]   I mean, it's got to be more to it than just talking to the X86 chip.
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.560]   Well, the Microsoft is giving it on my hand.
[00:30:46.560 --> 00:30:47.560]   No.
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:48.560]   Why would they?
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:49.560]   That's never going to happen.
[00:30:49.560 --> 00:30:50.560]   Well, you might have to buy a copy of Windows still.
[00:30:50.560 --> 00:30:51.560]   Right.
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:52.560]   You have to own Windows.
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:53.560]   You have to own Windows.
[00:30:53.560 --> 00:30:54.560]   Or still.
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:55.560]   It might be.
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:30:56.560]   Yeah.
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:57.560]   You still have to...
[00:30:57.560 --> 00:30:58.560]   Yeah.
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:30:59.560]   No, you don't.
[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:00.560]   Why is an API?
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:01.560]   Why is it work?
[00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:02.560]   That's the problem with that.
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:03.560]   So here's the deal with...
[00:31:03.560 --> 00:31:04.560]   Kinda works.
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:08.740]   On any new Mac, once they do an Intel chip, you'll be able to dual boot Windows.
[00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:09.740]   I mean, everybody...
[00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:10.740]   What anybody wants to do that?
[00:31:10.740 --> 00:31:11.740]   That's kind of a pain.
[00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:14.540]   Wouldn't it be nice if you're sitting there, you're running OS 10, you double click a Windows
[00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:15.740]   application and it opens.
[00:31:15.740 --> 00:31:16.740]   Yes.
[00:31:16.740 --> 00:31:17.740]   A little window there.
[00:31:17.740 --> 00:31:19.740]   They did it with OS 9.
[00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:21.460]   You know, they did it with X-Window.
[00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:23.500]   I don't see any reason why they couldn't do it with...
[00:31:23.500 --> 00:31:24.500]   Right.
[00:31:24.500 --> 00:31:25.500]   Well, but...
[00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:26.900]   OS 9 runs actually in the background.
[00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:28.900]   You have to, in a sense, boot OS 9 into OS 10.
[00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:29.900]   That's true.
[00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:32.860]   I think the same thing is probably gonna happen with Windows.
[00:31:32.860 --> 00:31:33.860]   So you'll have a...
[00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:36.620]   Lubebox like you might have had a Minkbox or whatever the...
[00:31:36.620 --> 00:31:37.620]   What was it?
[00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:38.620]   OS 9box called it.
[00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:40.100]   Well, it's funny, you used to crash.
[00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:41.100]   I used to have a RPC.
[00:31:41.100 --> 00:31:43.100]   You crash virtual PC and then you just quit.
[00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:44.100]   That was the nice thing.
[00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:45.100]   Back to OS 10.
[00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:46.940]   You know, you're like, "Ah, too bad."
[00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:49.340]   But I think what you're asking is, would there be that kind of...
[00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:51.140]   Well, the question is, as these vulnerabilities...
[00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:52.140]   Well, they won't be vulnerable.
[00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:53.140]   They'll be...
[00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:54.140]   In the way...
[00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:55.140]   The Windows partition...
[00:31:55.140 --> 00:31:56.140]   The Windows partition is vulnerable.
[00:31:56.140 --> 00:31:57.140]   The rest of the machine.
[00:31:57.140 --> 00:31:59.260]   And then you get into this question about whether...
[00:31:59.260 --> 00:32:02.900]   Do you just surf and do all your email on OS 10 and then use all the Windows applications
[00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:05.860]   you want in the Windows environment and then you don't have to...
[00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:07.780]   Then you just don't have to deal with it.
[00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:08.780]   You know, and the question...
[00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:11.420]   I really think that as...
[00:32:11.420 --> 00:32:16.860]   And I know that OS 10 is safer because inherently it's designed to be safer.
[00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:22.020]   But I think once Apple doesn't Intel, there will be exploits and there will be people
[00:32:22.020 --> 00:32:23.340]   trying to take advantage of this.
[00:32:23.340 --> 00:32:27.580]   And if they do do a seamless window, you'll see people writing all sorts of stuff that's...
[00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:29.140]   Well, right now with a trick you...
[00:32:29.140 --> 00:32:30.140]   And you see it does that.
[00:32:30.140 --> 00:32:35.540]   I mean, if you go and you download like an EXE in the Mac OS and you have a virtual PC
[00:32:35.540 --> 00:32:36.540]   there, you double click it.
[00:32:36.540 --> 00:32:39.780]   It instantly runs virtual PC if you've got it set up that way.
[00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:41.060]   So you have the same thing.
[00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:45.340]   If it's more closely integrated with the OS now, you get that EXE there.
[00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:49.700]   And it potentially could take off and run in the background in the Windows partition potentially.
[00:32:49.700 --> 00:32:51.700]   If they get the overhead down though for that emulation...
[00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:55.780]   That would be nice I think for game developers to be able to quickly port their titles over
[00:32:55.780 --> 00:32:56.780]   to the Mac platform.
[00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:58.780]   Well, presumably it wouldn't be any porting involved at all.
[00:32:58.780 --> 00:32:59.780]   Why would you want to port?
[00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:00.780]   Just run it.
[00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:01.780]   Well, here's the question.
[00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:02.780]   It's both...
[00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:04.980]   I think it's good for Apple in some ways.
[00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:09.180]   In some ways it's dangerous because for Apple, because what a lot of people have been talking
[00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:15.700]   about is that it may have PC developers be less likely to develop a Mac, a native Mac
[00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:17.180]   version because they don't need to.
[00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:19.820]   You know, they just write a Windows version knowing it's going to run on the Mac.
[00:33:19.820 --> 00:33:23.260]   So then Mac users might get the short end of the stick on some of the stuff.
[00:33:23.260 --> 00:33:28.020]   I'm not in total agreement with that because people who write for the Mac typically don't
[00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:29.020]   write for that.
[00:33:29.020 --> 00:33:31.100]   I mean, it's a specialty.
[00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:34.100]   And you're not going to, as a specialist with the Mac environment, you're not going to say,
[00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:36.580]   "Well, I think I'm going to start writing for Windows because it'll be easier to kill
[00:33:36.580 --> 00:33:38.100]   two birds with one stone."
[00:33:38.100 --> 00:33:41.260]   Most of the people I've seen, and I don't want to offend anybody, that try to...
[00:33:41.260 --> 00:33:44.260]   That are Mac developers that started developing for the PC, this stuff sucks.
[00:33:44.260 --> 00:33:47.180]   No, no, from a Mac point of view, it's the vice versa.
[00:33:47.180 --> 00:33:49.380]   The question is, is the people who sometimes...
[00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:53.940]   There's some people who port their PC app to the Mac, but it's kind of a half port.
[00:33:53.940 --> 00:33:54.940]   It sucks.
[00:33:54.940 --> 00:33:55.940]   And when they...
[00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:58.620]   But the question is, "Well, now that I can port is what you're saying."
[00:33:58.620 --> 00:33:59.620]   But they'll just...
[00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:00.620]   Who cares?
[00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:01.620]   As long as it runs.
[00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:02.620]   There's plenty of good Mac software.
[00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:03.620]   If it runs...
[00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:04.620]   There is?
[00:34:04.620 --> 00:34:05.620]   Yeah.
[00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:06.620]   I just wondered.
[00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:07.620]   I just asked.
[00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:09.820]   I think there's actually some of the stuff on the Mac is better than...
[00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:13.140]   I mean, on both platforms, there's stuff you wish you had on the other platform.
[00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:16.580]   But I have to say, I'm more often looking at stuff that I'm using on the Mac and saying,
[00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:17.940]   "I wish it were on the PC."
[00:34:17.940 --> 00:34:23.020]   But for audio editing, Apple has just really dropped the ball on this.
[00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:24.580]   This soundtrack pro, just a few.
[00:34:24.580 --> 00:34:26.540]   I know you like it, Alex.
[00:34:26.540 --> 00:34:27.540]   Awful program.
[00:34:27.540 --> 00:34:30.980]   But an Adobe audition on Windows is just fantastic.
[00:34:30.980 --> 00:34:31.980]   What's the difference?
[00:34:31.980 --> 00:34:32.980]   A big difference.
[00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:35.300]   It doesn't crash for one thing.
[00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:36.980]   Audition is a nice practice.
[00:34:36.980 --> 00:34:40.220]   Soundtrack pro crashes an hour and a half into an edit session.
[00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:41.220]   I told you this.
[00:34:41.220 --> 00:34:42.220]   It crashed.
[00:34:42.220 --> 00:34:43.220]   I just...
[00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:44.220]   You're still mad about it.
[00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:45.220]   I'm still mad about it.
[00:34:45.220 --> 00:34:46.220]   I'm still mad about it.
[00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:47.220]   I'm still looking.
[00:34:47.220 --> 00:34:48.220]   That's what Alex said.
[00:34:48.220 --> 00:34:52.420]   You can only blame the first five minutes on the computer.
[00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:53.420]   That's what I said.
[00:34:53.420 --> 00:34:54.420]   I guess I'm spoiled.
[00:34:54.420 --> 00:34:55.420]   Did you have a save built in?
[00:34:55.420 --> 00:34:56.420]   No.
[00:34:56.420 --> 00:34:57.420]   I guess I'm spoiled.
[00:34:57.420 --> 00:34:58.420]   No, it doesn't.
[00:34:58.420 --> 00:34:59.420]   Well, it's crazy.
[00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:02.340]   And the thing crashed silently and everything I had done was gone.
[00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:03.340]   I have to...
[00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:04.340]   I have to...
[00:35:04.340 --> 00:35:05.340]   I'm more close to audition now.
[00:35:05.340 --> 00:35:06.340]   The old soundtrack was not.
[00:35:06.340 --> 00:35:07.340]   The old soundtrack was not.
[00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:09.500]   Your complaint is the stability.
[00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:11.660]   Stability, but there's also some weird...
[00:35:11.660 --> 00:35:13.700]   Yeah, I guess it's mostly worse.
[00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:16.260]   Because I will say that I have found that soundtrack is pretty good.
[00:35:16.260 --> 00:35:20.020]   The soundtrack Pro is less stable on a laptop than it is on a G5.
[00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:21.460]   You said that to me, so I tried it.
[00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:23.460]   You crashed it immediately.
[00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:25.460]   No, the Mac just crashed.
[00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:27.740]   You're all one software.
[00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:28.900]   Google...
[00:35:28.900 --> 00:35:29.900]   Zitegeist.
[00:35:29.900 --> 00:35:30.900]   Do you look...
[00:35:30.900 --> 00:35:32.380]   I like this every year Google does this.
[00:35:32.380 --> 00:35:33.380]   What is a zeitgeist?
[00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:35.380]   What does it mean literally?
[00:35:35.380 --> 00:35:36.380]   I'm only hearing that word.
[00:35:36.380 --> 00:35:37.380]   I'm not the speaker.
[00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:39.380]   I'm sure we can find it out.
[00:35:39.380 --> 00:35:40.380]   You would rule the issue.
[00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:41.980]   Yeah, basically that's it, right?
[00:35:41.980 --> 00:35:43.780]   But what's the literal translation?
[00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:44.780]   That's what I find out.
[00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:45.780]   I do F2.
[00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:47.020]   They do this every year.
[00:35:47.020 --> 00:35:48.380]   It's a lot of fun.
[00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:49.620]   It's at google.com.
[00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:50.860]   It's a press page.
[00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:55.100]   But the top search is for instance the top search on...
[00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:56.100]   This baffles me.
[00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:58.460]   And Google News for 2005 was.
[00:35:58.460 --> 00:35:59.460]   Any thoughts?
[00:35:59.460 --> 00:36:02.820]   By the way, zeitgeist, German term meaning spirit of the time.
[00:36:02.820 --> 00:36:03.820]   Spirit of the time.
[00:36:03.820 --> 00:36:04.820]   I like that.
[00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:05.820]   It's better than worldview.
[00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:06.820]   Yeah.
[00:36:06.820 --> 00:36:07.820]   That would be Veltinschwan.
[00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:08.820]   Absolutely.
[00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:09.820]   Absolutely.
[00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:10.820]   That's good.
[00:36:10.820 --> 00:36:11.820]   Not your mention.
[00:36:11.820 --> 00:36:12.820]   I bet that's my college days.
[00:36:12.820 --> 00:36:15.220]   The top search in Google News of 2005.
[00:36:15.220 --> 00:36:18.060]   Would you think maybe Iraq or...
[00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:20.900]   Or you see you're close.
[00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:21.900]   But it's worse than that.
[00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:22.900]   It's like Madonna.
[00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:23.900]   It's like Madonna.
[00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:24.900]   Janet Jackson.
[00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:25.900]   That's really surprising.
[00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:28.100]   We forget that that's that happened at the beginning of last year.
[00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:29.100]   No, it didn't.
[00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:30.500]   Yeah, it was last Super Bowl.
[00:36:30.500 --> 00:36:31.500]   It was only 2005.
[00:36:31.500 --> 00:36:32.500]   Wasn't it the 2005?
[00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:33.500]   It was 2004.
[00:36:33.500 --> 00:36:34.500]   Sorry guys.
[00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:35.500]   It was 2004.
[00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:36.500]   It was 2004.
[00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:41.500]   Remember, Paul McCartney was 2005 and it was the tone down one where even if he took his shirt
[00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:42.900]   off nobody would be shocked.
[00:36:42.900 --> 00:36:43.900]   No one would care.
[00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:44.900]   2004.
[00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:48.220]   But they're still searching for it a year then Hurricane Katrina.
[00:36:48.220 --> 00:36:49.220]   That must be good.
[00:36:49.220 --> 00:36:52.580]   Then Tsunami which happened December 26, 2004.
[00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:56.300]   I mean this is then the Xbox 360.
[00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:58.340]   That must be an up and comer, right?
[00:36:58.340 --> 00:37:00.980]   Brad Pitt number five on the list.
[00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:02.660]   And the top gainers of 2005.
[00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:04.260]   Now this actually isn't too much of a surprise.
[00:37:04.260 --> 00:37:05.260]   Mine is hard to believe.
[00:37:05.260 --> 00:37:07.340]   What do you think they're lying?
[00:37:07.340 --> 00:37:08.340]   Yeah.
[00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:10.020]   Janet Jackson, come on.
[00:37:10.020 --> 00:37:11.780]   Maybe this is left over from last year.
[00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:13.980]   I'm telling you this doesn't make sense.
[00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:17.220]   Everyone's search on Frugal, they're a shopping site.
[00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:19.260]   Oh see this is the, no.
[00:37:19.260 --> 00:37:20.260]   Come on.
[00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:21.260]   My space.
[00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:22.260]   I don't know why Aries.
[00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:25.620]   What A-R-E-S was the top gainer in 2005 for searches.
[00:37:25.620 --> 00:37:28.980]   I must be something the kids are into.
[00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:29.980]   I don't know.
[00:37:29.980 --> 00:37:30.980]   I don't get it.
[00:37:30.980 --> 00:37:31.980]   Have you ever given my space?
[00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:32.980]   Probably.
[00:37:32.980 --> 00:37:33.980]   Yeah.
[00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:34.980]   We talked about it.
[00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:35.980]   Remember you saw my page?
[00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:36.980]   You saw my my space.
[00:37:36.980 --> 00:37:37.980]   Oh yeah.
[00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:38.980]   So I discovered a new one called Yelp.
[00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:39.980]   What is Yelp?
[00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:40.980]   It's at PCMag.com.
[00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:41.980]   You can check it out this week's column.
[00:37:41.980 --> 00:37:47.420]   Yelp is a very, in fact I was stunned by it because YELP.com for anybody else.
[00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:48.420]   It's great.
[00:37:48.420 --> 00:37:49.420]   I mean how do they get that?
[00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:50.420]   I don't know.
[00:37:50.420 --> 00:37:51.420]   They got lucky.
[00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:55.980]   But anyway, what it is is because over the years I've had two major complaints about
[00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:57.660]   two specific things.
[00:37:57.660 --> 00:37:59.900]   One is public reviews of restaurants.
[00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:03.500]   I think they stink because there's always a bunch of guys who are shills or people who
[00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:04.500]   just hate the restaurant.
[00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:06.500]   So even like the Zagit guy, you don't like the Zagit?
[00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:07.500]   No, no, no, Zagit guy's fair.
[00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:08.500]   That's pretty good.
[00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:10.860]   It's heavily edited by the way, no matter what they tell you.
[00:38:10.860 --> 00:38:12.580]   But now I'm talking about public reviews on the way.
[00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:13.580]   Like opinions kind of stuff.
[00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:14.580]   Well yeah, you go in there.
[00:38:14.580 --> 00:38:16.060]   So this place is the worst restaurant I've ever been to.
[00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:17.860]   It turns out to be the guy across the street right in the review.
[00:38:17.860 --> 00:38:18.860]   You don't know.
[00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:23.420]   And the other thing about it, I never really thought much of these social networks.
[00:38:23.420 --> 00:38:27.260]   What Yelp has done is put social networking and reviewing together.
[00:38:27.260 --> 00:38:28.260]   That's what I do.
[00:38:28.260 --> 00:38:32.100]   So you have a million reviewers out there but you can click on the person and see what
[00:38:32.100 --> 00:38:34.220]   their taste is like based on their other reviews.
[00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:37.060]   So it's almost like reverse engineering, that computer idea that tells you.
[00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:38.780]   If you like this book, you'll like that one.
[00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:43.260]   To me, the reviews on Amazon are absolutely worth their weight in gold.
[00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:46.380]   That's where, before I'll buy anything, I won't read consumer reports.
[00:38:46.380 --> 00:38:47.380]   I'll read Amazon.
[00:38:47.380 --> 00:38:48.580]   I won't look at PC Magazine.
[00:38:48.580 --> 00:38:52.180]   I'll read Amazon because those reviews are people using the product and they're really
[00:38:52.180 --> 00:38:53.180]   right on.
[00:38:53.180 --> 00:38:54.180]   Well, I don't know.
[00:38:54.180 --> 00:38:55.700]   I've seen vested interests on Amazon.
[00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:57.260]   Yeah, but you can tell right away.
[00:38:57.260 --> 00:38:58.420]   But this is even better because we do.
[00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:00.940]   How do you avoid the, how do we know this is invested interest?
[00:39:00.940 --> 00:39:05.100]   Well, because when you click on this person, you can go and see everything they've reviewed,
[00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:06.100]   who their friends are.
[00:39:06.100 --> 00:39:07.940]   And you get a feeling for what this person's like.
[00:39:07.940 --> 00:39:09.820]   And you can pretty much reverse the engineering.
[00:39:09.820 --> 00:39:11.540]   Let's find something we all know.
[00:39:11.540 --> 00:39:13.260]   Maybe a San Francisco restaurant we can see.
[00:39:13.260 --> 00:39:15.380]   And this is mostly San Francisco, it seems to me.
[00:39:15.380 --> 00:39:16.780]   Well, I wouldn't be surprised.
[00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:19.060]   Well, E-Vite has something like it also now.
[00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:20.060]   You can say E-Vite.
[00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:22.060]   Yeah, I know, but you don't get the depth.
[00:39:22.060 --> 00:39:26.060]   I mean, we got people on here that are 500 reviews deep.
[00:39:26.060 --> 00:39:27.700]   Here's a review of the Golden Gate Bridge.
[00:39:27.700 --> 00:39:28.700]   Yeah, there's everything.
[00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:30.260]   Actually, there's everything by the way.
[00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:32.220]   There's 21 reviews of the Golden Gate Bridge.
[00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:33.220]   They review dry cleaners.
[00:39:33.220 --> 00:39:35.300]   It gets five strands of beer.
[00:39:35.300 --> 00:39:36.980]   They review everything.
[00:39:36.980 --> 00:39:38.500]   But they also review a lot of restaurants.
[00:39:38.500 --> 00:39:39.500]   I love that bridge.
[00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:44.020]   Gourmet G writes, "There is little I can add to the accolades, already bestowed upon it
[00:39:44.020 --> 00:39:45.660]   by fellow yelpers.
[00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:48.660]   Though I scoff at those who criticize it for attracting tourists."
[00:39:48.660 --> 00:39:49.660]   Yeah, okay.
[00:39:49.660 --> 00:39:52.460]   Some of the reviewers are a little corny.
[00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:53.460]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:55.660]   Here's an ode to the bridge.
[00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:59.220]   Paste, how did you get to be so friggin' handsome?
[00:39:59.220 --> 00:40:04.140]   You're not like other bridges with that crazy orange dye job and your spectacular shoulders.
[00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:05.140]   I'm telling you.
[00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:06.140]   You know what it's entertaining too.
[00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:07.140]   That's what you're telling me.
[00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:10.740]   I'm telling you, yelpers is at least as entertaining as Craig's list.
[00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:13.660]   If you want to just waste time, go on, yelpers.
[00:40:13.660 --> 00:40:15.260]   Let me see some other...
[00:40:15.260 --> 00:40:16.260]   And then after...
[00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:17.260]   Okay, so I can see what else...
[00:40:17.260 --> 00:40:20.660]   I mean, I like this Kevin S review, so I can see what else Kevin S is reviewing.
[00:40:20.660 --> 00:40:21.660]   Right, he can read all his stuff.
[00:40:21.660 --> 00:40:26.300]   And if he agrees with you and a lot of things you can say when he discovers a new restaurant
[00:40:26.300 --> 00:40:28.580]   or bar, Kevin's got good taste.
[00:40:28.580 --> 00:40:30.300]   This is basically replacing friendship.
[00:40:30.300 --> 00:40:31.300]   Exactly.
[00:40:31.300 --> 00:40:33.300]   Yeah, no, because we do not want to...
[00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:36.100]   I don't want to have to be witching.
[00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:37.100]   Wasting friendship.
[00:40:37.100 --> 00:40:38.100]   Yeah, that's all what...
[00:40:38.100 --> 00:40:40.100]   I wonder what his friendship is.
[00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:41.100]   Don't go there.
[00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:42.100]   Who needs that?
[00:40:42.100 --> 00:40:44.300]   I've never been asked.
[00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:46.300]   It used to be zeitgeist.
[00:40:46.300 --> 00:40:50.380]   Anyway, so you can waste a lot of time on this.
[00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:51.980]   It says, but it's quite fun.
[00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:53.860]   So he's got reviews of Craton Barrel.
[00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:55.820]   As long as he says Amici's pizza is the best.
[00:40:55.820 --> 00:40:56.820]   He actually reviews...
[00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:57.820]   You see, there's a little...
[00:40:57.820 --> 00:40:58.820]   I want to speak.
[00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:01.100]   I'm going through a thing called Little Star pizza.
[00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:04.100]   You check this place?
[00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:05.660]   It's all about North Beach.
[00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:06.660]   The North Beach special.
[00:41:06.660 --> 00:41:07.660]   North Beach is okay.
[00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:08.660]   I think it's good if you're special.
[00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:09.660]   I'm actually going to get you in the place.
[00:41:09.660 --> 00:41:13.300]   He's got a review of San Francisco International Airport.
[00:41:13.300 --> 00:41:14.300]   Did he give it one star?
[00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:16.300]   The International Wing Rock.
[00:41:16.300 --> 00:41:17.300]   That's the new...
[00:41:17.300 --> 00:41:19.300]   Oh, that's probably the best.
[00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:20.300]   He's like, "Apple store in San Francisco."
[00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:23.260]   No, I'm sorry, in Burlingame, two stars.
[00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:25.260]   He didn't like it.
[00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:26.260]   Didn't like it.
[00:41:26.260 --> 00:41:27.260]   And Veronica's market, two stars?
[00:41:27.260 --> 00:41:28.260]   I don't know.
[00:41:28.260 --> 00:41:29.260]   I haven't...
[00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:30.260]   I stopped going when they stopped giving me three hours.
[00:41:30.260 --> 00:41:32.260]   The Gemini meteor shower though.
[00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:34.260]   Yeah, I think maybe you get the wrong guy here.
[00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:38.260]   I think this is so Yelp.
[00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:40.180]   Anyway, check it out.
[00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:41.540]   No, I think that's good.
[00:41:41.540 --> 00:41:42.540]   I like...
[00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:43.540]   I think there...
[00:41:43.540 --> 00:41:44.540]   Social bookmarking...
[00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:45.540]   Social...
[00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:50.340]   It's hard with that Kevin here because he's kind of now one of the leaders of social news
[00:41:50.340 --> 00:41:51.340]   sites.
[00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:53.940]   But I never really thought that much of it.
[00:41:53.940 --> 00:41:56.100]   But I think that there's potential there.
[00:41:56.100 --> 00:41:57.100]   It doesn't seem like it's...
[00:41:57.100 --> 00:41:58.700]   Well, this is the interesting combination.
[00:41:58.700 --> 00:42:03.180]   I thought was unique because they combined two ideas that were both weak.
[00:42:03.180 --> 00:42:04.180]   Right.
[00:42:04.180 --> 00:42:05.180]   Well, there's a...
[00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:08.780]   At Macworld, I just saw something about like a social networking software that works on
[00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:09.780]   Wi-Fi.
[00:42:09.780 --> 00:42:13.340]   So you can put down what you like and then other people on the show floor.
[00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:14.340]   It will show you where they are.
[00:42:14.340 --> 00:42:15.340]   Oh, I like that.
[00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:16.340]   I did for a trade show.
[00:42:16.340 --> 00:42:18.300]   And so you can go around and find like...
[00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:19.300]   If you're looking for people...
[00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:20.300]   It's a lowly return.
[00:42:20.300 --> 00:42:23.860]   Or if you're looking for people that have similar interests, you install the software
[00:42:23.860 --> 00:42:25.060]   and it uses the Wi-Fi.
[00:42:25.060 --> 00:42:29.500]   I would subscribe to the Vorex RSS feed on the CES show floor.
[00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:33.020]   And then I would see the feed of where John is now and you could rate it.
[00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:34.020]   That's what I like.
[00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:36.020]   People following me around in virtual world.
[00:42:36.020 --> 00:42:37.020]   Cloud.
[00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:38.020]   You have to keep on moving.
[00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:39.020]   He's there.
[00:42:39.020 --> 00:42:40.020]   Go, go, go.
[00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:41.020]   Somebody else...
[00:42:41.020 --> 00:42:42.020]   Somebody else...
[00:42:42.020 --> 00:42:43.020]   It's a friendship duck.
[00:42:43.020 --> 00:42:44.020]   I know.
[00:42:44.020 --> 00:42:45.020]   It's just one of those...
[00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:46.020]   So Seagate bought Mac Store.
[00:42:46.020 --> 00:42:47.020]   Do we care?
[00:42:47.020 --> 00:42:48.020]   No.
[00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:49.020]   Yeah.
[00:42:49.020 --> 00:42:50.020]   Get rid of...
[00:42:50.020 --> 00:42:51.020]   Well, not to get rid of Mac Store, but...
[00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:52.020]   Mac Store was okay.
[00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:53.020]   Yeah.
[00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:55.220]   And the USB drives are quite gorgeous.
[00:42:55.220 --> 00:42:56.220]   So one touch.
[00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:57.220]   Do you like those one too?
[00:42:57.220 --> 00:42:59.900]   Well, I never did it initially, but the last one they did just before they got bought
[00:42:59.900 --> 00:43:01.420]   is really a hot looking box.
[00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:02.420]   Yeah.
[00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:03.500]   Next to my son walked off with it.
[00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:05.300]   It's a JAMBO networks.
[00:43:05.300 --> 00:43:07.220]   That's what's a social networking tool.
[00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:08.220]   JAMBO.
[00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:10.980]   I think that's a very interesting use of social networking.
[00:43:10.980 --> 00:43:12.460]   That's for like real time.
[00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:13.460]   But how's it going to look?
[00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:14.460]   Does it look like you have it on a phone?
[00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:16.180]   Is it like a Japanese dating service?
[00:43:16.180 --> 00:43:17.180]   Or what's...
[00:43:17.180 --> 00:43:21.780]   It lets Wi-Fi connected users discover each other in proximity.
[00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:27.020]   It's based on a social networking tool to help people find industry peers, customers,
[00:43:27.020 --> 00:43:28.660]   friends, enthusiasts with similar interests.
[00:43:28.660 --> 00:43:29.660]   But that's what they're doing.
[00:43:29.660 --> 00:43:30.660]   So it's a big issue.
[00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:31.660]   So it's a big issue.
[00:43:31.660 --> 00:43:33.420]   It's some sort of a sex angle.
[00:43:33.420 --> 00:43:34.420]   Yeah.
[00:43:34.420 --> 00:43:35.420]   Sounds like talking about...
[00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:37.820]   We have a clean badge on this podcast.
[00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:38.820]   You notice that now?
[00:43:38.820 --> 00:43:39.820]   Yeah.
[00:43:39.820 --> 00:43:40.820]   Yeah.
[00:43:40.820 --> 00:43:42.300]   I haven't gotten any further than just use the word, by the way.
[00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:43.300]   We are clean.
[00:43:43.300 --> 00:43:44.300]   You know, I...
[00:43:44.300 --> 00:43:45.300]   You're a hard thing.
[00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:47.100]   And that's the way to be, by the way.
[00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:50.860]   Well, you know, all of a sudden this appeared as one of the tags that you can use.
[00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:52.980]   It used to be explicit or nothing, right?
[00:43:52.980 --> 00:43:53.980]   On the iTunes Music Store.
[00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:56.020]   And all of a sudden this new tag, Clean, appeared.
[00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:58.340]   And then you went to the next tag, we'll be using Square.
[00:43:58.340 --> 00:43:59.340]   I like it.
[00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:01.420]   I think we should have other tags.
[00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:06.900]   Square, Clean, Wellgroom, Funky, Bad Hat, Round.
[00:44:06.900 --> 00:44:07.900]   Thanks.
[00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:09.620]   No, I think we could...
[00:44:09.620 --> 00:44:12.020]   Did you notice that this year is going to be one second longer?
[00:44:12.020 --> 00:44:13.020]   Yeah.
[00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:14.020]   I'm starting to...
[00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:15.020]   I've been making lists.
[00:44:15.020 --> 00:44:16.020]   I've been making lists of what I'm doing.
[00:44:16.020 --> 00:44:17.020]   What to do?
[00:44:17.020 --> 00:44:18.020]   Last second, yeah.
[00:44:18.020 --> 00:44:23.140]   Steve Martin wrote a hysterical blog entry for Ariana Huffington's website in which he
[00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:27.940]   says it's a conspiracy that the Republicans are all upset about the extra second because
[00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:32.820]   the Democrats are going to use it to hate George Bush for one second more this year.
[00:44:32.820 --> 00:44:35.540]   I'm not doing it justice.
[00:44:35.540 --> 00:44:38.500]   I'm not doing it justice, but it's a very funny piece from Steve Martin.
[00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:40.420]   His first is, I far as I know, his first blog entry.
[00:44:40.420 --> 00:44:44.180]   I don't know if he's going to be a blogger or if that's just a one off deal, but it's
[00:44:44.180 --> 00:44:46.660]   very funny.
[00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:51.060]   The Obama tickets sales slide big time.
[00:44:51.060 --> 00:44:52.060]   It's just a trend.
[00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:54.100]   The third year in a row.
[00:44:54.100 --> 00:44:57.580]   Well, since 2002, that's the last year in which there was not a decline, a total of
[00:44:57.580 --> 00:45:00.100]   12.6% decline in ticket sales.
[00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:03.100]   One that's lowest attendance since '97 of them.
[00:45:03.100 --> 00:45:04.100]   Why?
[00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:05.100]   You know what?
[00:45:05.100 --> 00:45:06.100]   I bet you that doesn't apply to Los Angeles.
[00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:10.300]   I mean, compared to the Bay Area, the theaters in LA were so much better compared to...
[00:45:10.300 --> 00:45:11.300]   It's like garbage.
[00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:12.300]   You mean the quality.
[00:45:12.300 --> 00:45:13.300]   Quality.
[00:45:13.300 --> 00:45:15.380]   In San Francisco, I mean, I know a lot of people aren't listening there, but San Francisco,
[00:45:15.380 --> 00:45:19.620]   the Vanessa 1000 and the Metriana are pretty much the only places to watch a movie.
[00:45:19.620 --> 00:45:20.620]   Oh, no, no.
[00:45:20.620 --> 00:45:21.620]   Everything else is closed.
[00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:22.620]   The MPAA says it's BitTorrent.
[00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:23.620]   It's all about BitTorrent.
[00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:27.260]   I'll tell you these guys blame everyone but themselves.
[00:45:27.260 --> 00:45:30.700]   Show for people out there who want to watch, who like to watch insider stuff, which is
[00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:36.300]   you might, since you listen to this podcast, is Sunday morning shootout.
[00:45:36.300 --> 00:45:37.300]   It's on AMC.
[00:45:37.300 --> 00:45:38.300]   Oh, I like that.
[00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:39.300]   It's on AMC.
[00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:40.300]   It's on AMC 30.
[00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:41.300]   Oh, I like that.
[00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:43.340]   It has Peter Goober and Peter, who is the other Peter, who's getting mad at me now, but
[00:45:43.340 --> 00:45:45.100]   he was the editor of Variety.
[00:45:45.100 --> 00:45:49.580]   And they sit around, it's totally, it's about the movie industry.
[00:45:49.580 --> 00:45:53.780]   But the thing that Goober keeps pointing out is that the theater experience is deteriorating,
[00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:56.540]   where you have to watch commercials before they show the movie.
[00:45:56.540 --> 00:45:59.900]   I think the commercials is the number one thing.
[00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:01.700]   You just feel like it's 20 minutes.
[00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:02.700]   Sometimes I get in there.
[00:46:02.700 --> 00:46:03.700]   I can't even remember what movie I went.
[00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:04.700]   I'm waiting to watch.
[00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:05.700]   It's like a surprise.
[00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:06.700]   It's 20 commercials.
[00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:07.700]   It's unbelievable.
[00:46:07.700 --> 00:46:08.700]   They have the gall to do that.
[00:46:08.700 --> 00:46:10.940]   I think they're in Hong a couple of days ago.
[00:46:10.940 --> 00:46:12.220]   It's like a five hour.
[00:46:12.220 --> 00:46:14.700]   They had a three hour movie and two hours of commercials.
[00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:15.700]   It's like your whole day is shot.
[00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:16.900]   Oh, they had a trap, though.
[00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:17.900]   They got you.
[00:46:17.900 --> 00:46:18.900]   The advertisers love that environment.
[00:46:18.900 --> 00:46:20.700]   I know, but I think that's what's causing them.
[00:46:20.700 --> 00:46:21.700]   I think that's what's causing them.
[00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:22.700]   The names of the advertisers and the boycott them.
[00:46:22.700 --> 00:46:23.700]   Do it.
[00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:24.700]   That's a good idea.
[00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:27.340]   Well, I do think, though, that I think that it's that type of thing.
[00:46:27.340 --> 00:46:29.220]   The commercials are making a huge difference.
[00:46:29.220 --> 00:46:31.980]   Whether people think about it, like, oh, I'm not going to go to the movie anymore.
[00:46:31.980 --> 00:46:36.620]   I think there's an underlying discomfort that creates going on.
[00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:37.620]   There's other things.
[00:46:37.620 --> 00:46:38.620]   There's demographics.
[00:46:38.620 --> 00:46:39.620]   There's the aging population.
[00:46:39.620 --> 00:46:42.180]   People are nesting to 911.
[00:46:42.180 --> 00:46:43.180]   Everybody wants to go out anymore.
[00:46:43.180 --> 00:46:44.180]   There's a lot of other things.
[00:46:44.180 --> 00:46:46.740]   When I was living in LA, we had some sweet, sweet theaters.
[00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:51.540]   You could do everything from reserving a specific seat to having drinks served to you.
[00:46:51.540 --> 00:46:54.820]   I said, in London, it's the theaters of London.
[00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:56.780]   And some were really hardcore about the movie.
[00:46:56.780 --> 00:46:57.780]   So it's not the movie.
[00:46:57.780 --> 00:46:59.260]   I mean, DVD sales aren't down.
[00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:00.260]   DVD rentals aren't down.
[00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:01.260]   It's not the movies.
[00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:02.260]   It's the experience.
[00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:03.260]   Well, I think it's the experience.
[00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:06.380]   I think it's also, I do think it's also the quality of what we can get at home now between
[00:47:06.380 --> 00:47:08.900]   projectors and plasma screens and everything else.
[00:47:08.900 --> 00:47:11.860]   I look at movies now and I go, I literally think about them.
[00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:12.860]   Is it going to be a big experience?
[00:47:12.860 --> 00:47:16.180]   Is it a King Kong or is it Narnia or is it Lord of the Rings or whatever?
[00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:17.180]   I want to go see that.
[00:47:17.180 --> 00:47:19.540]   As far as color and dynamic range, you can do better in your home.
[00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:20.540]   By the way, it's P and Barter.
[00:47:20.540 --> 00:47:21.540]   Right, is the other part.
[00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:22.540]   Thank you.
[00:47:22.540 --> 00:47:27.300]   The, yeah, in fact, I only go see maybe, personally two or three movies.
[00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:30.180]   Yeah, well, movies that you know are going to be interesting on a big screen.
[00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:31.180]   And it's too expensive.
[00:47:31.180 --> 00:47:35.740]   It's too expensive to go to every little movie when I can watch it on a 100 inch screen
[00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:36.740]   at home.
[00:47:36.740 --> 00:47:37.740]   Yeah.
[00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:38.740]   Right.
[00:47:38.740 --> 00:47:41.260]   Although you wish you could pause King Kong because it's really two movies jammed together.
[00:47:41.260 --> 00:47:43.500]   I don't know what Jackson didn't want to do another trilogy.
[00:47:43.500 --> 00:47:44.500]   I don't know.
[00:47:44.500 --> 00:47:45.500]   I just got to.
[00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:48.300]   But as soon as, as soon as you know, they're going to New York, you want to pause.
[00:47:48.300 --> 00:47:49.300]   There was so funny.
[00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:50.300]   There was part.
[00:47:50.300 --> 00:47:51.300]   There was the only part.
[00:47:51.300 --> 00:47:52.300]   There's New York where he's doing movies.
[00:47:52.300 --> 00:47:55.660]   Right at that break in my theater, I kid you not.
[00:47:55.660 --> 00:47:58.340]   15 people stood up right when they were going back to New York.
[00:47:58.340 --> 00:47:59.340]   That's right.
[00:47:59.340 --> 00:48:02.340]   They stood up, ran out, and they ran back to you know, they were, they just, they knew
[00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:03.340]   that the best thing that I'll ever be.
[00:48:03.340 --> 00:48:05.500]   And they stopped in the movie as doing an intermission like they used to do with big
[00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:06.500]   movies.
[00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:07.500]   They used to do that.
[00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:08.500]   That's right.
[00:48:08.500 --> 00:48:09.500]   Especially anything over three hours.
[00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:10.500]   They stopped going to the hospital.
[00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:12.500]   Let's all go to the lobby.
[00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:14.140]   It doesn't make sense to me.
[00:48:14.140 --> 00:48:16.540]   The best special effects I thought in King Kong.
[00:48:16.540 --> 00:48:18.580]   I mean, obviously the King Kong's amazing.
[00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:21.860]   By the way, Andy Serkis again, the guy who did go on.
[00:48:21.860 --> 00:48:23.860]   Did you hear about what he had, what he went through?
[00:48:23.860 --> 00:48:24.860]   Was it a beep?
[00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:25.860]   No, no.
[00:48:25.860 --> 00:48:26.860]   What was he?
[00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:27.860]   He was an emotion capture.
[00:48:27.860 --> 00:48:30.980]   But the interesting thing was, is he really wanted to go to Rwanda because that's where
[00:48:30.980 --> 00:48:31.980]   all the gorillas are.
[00:48:31.980 --> 00:48:32.980]   You see the real gorilla.
[00:48:32.980 --> 00:48:33.980]   He wanted to see him.
[00:48:33.980 --> 00:48:36.780]   Peter Jackson thought it was too dangerous to go to Rwanda.
[00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:37.780]   So he wouldn't allow me.
[00:48:37.780 --> 00:48:38.940]   He said, we won't pay for it.
[00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:39.940]   We won't send you.
[00:48:39.940 --> 00:49:03.340]   He used his own money and flew out on his own in
[00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:10.340]   the morning.
[00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:17.340]   He said, we'll be back.
[00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:24.340]   We'll be back.
[00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:31.340]   We'll be back.
[00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:38.340]   We'll be back.
[00:49:38.340 --> 00:49:45.340]   We'll be back.
[00:49:45.340 --> 00:49:52.340]   We'll be back.
[00:49:52.340 --> 00:49:59.340]   We'll be back.
[00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:06.340]   We'll be back.
[00:50:06.340 --> 00:50:13.340]   We'll be back.
[00:50:13.340 --> 00:50:20.340]   We'll be back.
[00:50:20.340 --> 00:50:27.340]   We'll be back.
[00:50:27.340 --> 00:50:34.340]   We'll be back.
[00:50:34.340 --> 00:50:41.340]   We'll be back.
[00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:48.340]   We'll be back.
[00:50:48.340 --> 00:50:53.340]   We'll be back.
[00:50:53.340 --> 00:51:00.340]   We'll be back.
[00:51:00.340 --> 00:51:07.340]   We'll be back.
[00:51:07.340 --> 00:51:12.340]   We'll be back.
[00:51:12.340 --> 00:51:19.340]   We'll be back.
[00:51:19.340 --> 00:51:26.340]   We'll be back.
[00:51:26.340 --> 00:51:33.340]   We'll be back.
[00:51:33.340 --> 00:51:38.340]   We'll be back.
[00:51:38.340 --> 00:51:45.340]   We'll be back.
[00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:52.340]   We'll be back.
[00:51:52.340 --> 00:51:59.340]   We'll be back.
[00:51:59.340 --> 00:52:04.340]   We'll be back.
[00:52:04.340 --> 00:52:08.340]   We'll be back.
[00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:12.340]   We'll be back.
[00:52:12.340 --> 00:52:19.340]   We'll be back.
[00:52:19.340 --> 00:52:26.340]   We'll be back.
[00:52:26.340 --> 00:52:31.340]   We'll be back.
[00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:34.340]   We'll be back.
[00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:41.340]   We'll be back.
[00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:48.340]   We'll be back.
[00:52:48.340 --> 00:52:55.340]   We'll be back.
[00:52:55.340 --> 00:53:00.340]   We'll be back.
[00:53:00.340 --> 00:53:04.340]   We'll be back.
[00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:08.340]   We'll be back.
[00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:18.340]   We'll be back.
[00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:27.340]   We'll be back.
[00:53:27.340 --> 00:53:28.340]   We'll be back.
[00:53:28.340 --> 00:53:31.340]   We'll be back.
[00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:35.340]   We'll be back.

[01:04:46.340 --> 01:04:50.340]   I'm in Sweden and they're showing me IPTV casually
[01:04:50.340 --> 01:04:52.340]   since it's available there,
[01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:54.340]   and they put me in front of a television set on
[01:04:54.340 --> 01:04:58.340]   which is hooked to the internet at a 30 megabits per second rate.
[01:04:58.340 --> 01:05:00.340]   And they give me a gun and say,
[01:05:00.340 --> 01:05:02.340]   "That's not... I was on cable TV.
[01:05:02.340 --> 01:05:04.340]   I thought I was on Comcast, but it was all HD,
[01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:06.340]   and it was just clicking through like..."
[01:05:06.340 --> 01:05:08.340]   That's not a revolution.
[01:05:08.340 --> 01:05:10.340]   That's just minor infrastructure changes.
[01:05:10.340 --> 01:05:12.340]   I don't think the Comcast people would think it's a minor.
[01:05:12.340 --> 01:05:14.340]   Well, they don't.
[01:05:14.340 --> 01:05:16.340]   But it's like VoIP.
[01:05:16.340 --> 01:05:18.340]   When you call Mexico, you use internet telephony,
[01:05:18.340 --> 01:05:20.340]   not because they're packitizing it instead of a switched network.
[01:05:20.340 --> 01:05:22.340]   But this is, I think,
[01:05:22.340 --> 01:05:24.340]   in the States, when we say IPTV,
[01:05:24.340 --> 01:05:26.340]   we mean really much more drastic change.
[01:05:26.340 --> 01:05:28.340]   The idea of broad,
[01:05:28.340 --> 01:05:30.340]   being able to download stuff,
[01:05:30.340 --> 01:05:32.340]   watch it, you know, when we want to,
[01:05:32.340 --> 01:05:34.340]   how we want to, whatever we want to.
[01:05:34.340 --> 01:05:36.340]   I think that's where IPTV is headed.
[01:05:36.340 --> 01:05:38.340]   Yeah, but I just want to know what's happening right now.
[01:05:38.340 --> 01:05:40.340]   It's what's happening right now.
[01:05:40.340 --> 01:05:44.340]   The problem is forward and backward time switching in real time on the cable.
[01:05:44.340 --> 01:05:45.340]   You can't do it.
[01:05:45.340 --> 01:05:47.340]   No, you can't do it.
[01:05:47.340 --> 01:05:49.340]   But it's like video on demand stuff,
[01:05:49.340 --> 01:05:51.340]   which a little bit chews up a lot of resources.
[01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:52.340]   But, you know, the fact is,
[01:05:52.340 --> 01:05:54.340]   say you start the Letterman show
[01:05:54.340 --> 01:05:56.340]   and you didn't... you missed the first ten minutes.
[01:05:56.340 --> 01:05:58.340]   You can go back.
[01:05:58.340 --> 01:06:00.340]   You can go back on the cable in real time.
[01:06:00.340 --> 01:06:02.340]   You can do that in Comcast VOD now.
[01:06:02.340 --> 01:06:03.340]   Yeah. Yeah.
[01:06:03.340 --> 01:06:04.340]   You can go backwards in time?
[01:06:04.340 --> 01:06:06.340]   If the program is provided.
[01:06:06.340 --> 01:06:07.340]   Yeah, I think you can.
[01:06:07.340 --> 01:06:08.340]   Maybe. I don't think so.
[01:06:08.340 --> 01:06:09.340]   Well, you don't watch it.
[01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:10.340]   First of all, you don't watch it on a schedule.
[01:06:10.340 --> 01:06:12.340]   You start playing it, but you can re-
[01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:12.340]   You can re-
[01:06:12.340 --> 01:06:14.340]   You're on demand stuff.
[01:06:14.340 --> 01:06:16.340]   Yeah, but I'm talking about TV, regular TV schedule.
[01:06:16.340 --> 01:06:17.340]   On schedule.
[01:06:17.340 --> 01:06:18.340]   Yeah.
[01:06:18.340 --> 01:06:21.340]   I just think the whole concept of schedule is going to go away.
[01:06:21.340 --> 01:06:23.340]   I think we'll see this year.
[01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:25.340]   Somebody come up with a really nice software app
[01:06:25.340 --> 01:06:27.340]   that maybe ties into a distributed database
[01:06:27.340 --> 01:06:29.340]   just so to make it you can select the shows.
[01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:31.340]   It just seems to me that I take you on
[01:06:31.340 --> 01:06:34.340]   and watch last two easy days Letterman show on demand.
[01:06:34.340 --> 01:06:35.340]   Like now.
[01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:36.340]   You should.
[01:06:36.340 --> 01:06:37.340]   Well, you can't...
[01:06:37.340 --> 01:06:39.340]   I mean, you watch the monologue part through iTunes right now.
[01:06:39.340 --> 01:06:40.340]   You can go down.
[01:06:40.340 --> 01:06:41.340]   I don't want to do the iTunes.
[01:06:41.340 --> 01:06:42.340]   I want to watch the whole show
[01:06:42.340 --> 01:06:44.340]   and I want to watch it from last week.
[01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:45.340]   Like last Tuesday, I want to watch it.
[01:06:45.340 --> 01:06:46.340]   That's just a...
[01:06:46.340 --> 01:06:47.340]   Now.
[01:06:47.340 --> 01:06:48.340]   You're having it there.
[01:06:48.340 --> 01:06:49.340]   Like, I have to admit,
[01:06:49.340 --> 01:06:50.340]   the one thing that...
[01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:52.340]   Well, you've got to get CBS to go along with it.
[01:06:52.340 --> 01:06:53.340]   That's the only issue, really.
[01:06:53.340 --> 01:06:55.340]   I mean, the thing that I have to admit
[01:06:55.340 --> 01:06:58.340]   that I've gotten kind of addicted to buying shows on iTunes.
[01:06:58.340 --> 01:07:01.340]   And the thing is I got on the surface.
[01:07:01.340 --> 01:07:02.340]   The surface is good.
[01:07:02.340 --> 01:07:03.340]   I tried surface once.
[01:07:03.340 --> 01:07:04.340]   I tried at once.
[01:07:04.340 --> 01:07:05.340]   I tried at once.
[01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:06.340]   I got two.
[01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:07.340]   And then I just bought the rest.
[01:07:07.340 --> 01:07:08.340]   I just bought them all.
[01:07:08.340 --> 01:07:10.340]   And so I'm sitting there biking,
[01:07:10.340 --> 01:07:12.340]   watching them one after another.
[01:07:12.340 --> 01:07:14.340]   And you're riding your bicycle?
[01:07:14.340 --> 01:07:15.340]   No, okay.
[01:07:15.340 --> 01:07:17.340]   I stationary bike about an hour and a half a day.
[01:07:17.340 --> 01:07:18.340]   Oh, okay.
[01:07:18.340 --> 01:07:19.340]   So, you know, I have to lose...
[01:07:19.340 --> 01:07:20.340]   And you're watching and I'll be getting married.
[01:07:20.340 --> 01:07:21.340]   I have to lose 20 pounds.
[01:07:21.340 --> 01:07:23.340]   You're getting married, so you have to lose 20 pounds?
[01:07:23.340 --> 01:07:24.340]   Yeah, I decided I want to.
[01:07:24.340 --> 01:07:25.340]   I just wanted to have good pictures.
[01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:26.340]   What a TV in front of the place.
[01:07:26.340 --> 01:07:28.340]   So anyway, well, here's the worst part.
[01:07:28.340 --> 01:07:29.340]   Here's the thing.
[01:07:29.340 --> 01:07:30.340]   You can gain it right back.
[01:07:30.340 --> 01:07:31.340]   There is a TV, though.
[01:07:31.340 --> 01:07:32.340]   There is a TV.
[01:07:32.340 --> 01:07:35.340]   He wants to fit his wedding gown.
[01:07:35.340 --> 01:07:36.340]   Yeah, you know.
[01:07:36.340 --> 01:07:38.340]   There is a TV on my bike,
[01:07:38.340 --> 01:07:40.340]   but I don't want to watch cable.
[01:07:40.340 --> 01:07:41.340]   I want to watch the stuff I want to watch.
[01:07:41.340 --> 01:07:42.340]   And so it happens.
[01:07:42.340 --> 01:07:43.340]   And you watch a little screen,
[01:07:43.340 --> 01:07:44.340]   why don't you put it, set up some rig with it.
[01:07:44.340 --> 01:07:45.340]   Because it's at the gym.
[01:07:45.340 --> 01:07:46.340]   It's at the gym.
[01:07:46.340 --> 01:07:47.340]   So I have...
[01:07:47.340 --> 01:07:49.340]   You have to kind of money that can have your own TV at home.
[01:07:49.340 --> 01:07:50.340]   Yeah, right.
[01:07:50.340 --> 01:07:51.340]   Anyway, anyway, so the...
[01:07:51.340 --> 01:07:52.340]   It doesn't even look like a car.
[01:07:52.340 --> 01:07:53.340]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:07:53.340 --> 01:07:54.340]   You've got to get.
[01:07:54.340 --> 01:07:55.340]   Show fur.
[01:07:55.340 --> 01:07:56.340]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:07:56.340 --> 01:07:59.340]   So I watch my little iPod, though.
[01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:00.340]   And last night, I would...
[01:08:00.340 --> 01:08:01.340]   Anyways, I started watching Surface,
[01:08:01.340 --> 01:08:03.340]   and I go boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:08:03.340 --> 01:08:04.340]   And suddenly I'm watching, like,
[01:08:04.340 --> 01:08:05.340]   two a day, you know,
[01:08:05.340 --> 01:08:06.340]   while I'm working out,
[01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:07.340]   because you knew about an hour and a half.
[01:08:07.340 --> 01:08:08.340]   It's a pretty addictive show.
[01:08:08.340 --> 01:08:09.340]   I get to the end, and I go,
[01:08:09.340 --> 01:08:10.340]   "Whoop!"
[01:08:10.340 --> 01:08:12.340]   And then I have to slow back down to broadcast.
[01:08:12.340 --> 01:08:14.340]   I have to wait now every week for the next one to come out.
[01:08:14.340 --> 01:08:15.340]   And then Lost is even worse.
[01:08:15.340 --> 01:08:17.340]   It's been like three or four weeks since they put out.
[01:08:17.340 --> 01:08:18.340]   They put out another Lost.
[01:08:18.340 --> 01:08:22.340]   You know, and I think that this is happening with the TV shows on DVD.
[01:08:22.340 --> 01:08:23.340]   People are...
[01:08:23.340 --> 01:08:24.340]   It's totally conditioning people.
[01:08:24.340 --> 01:08:25.340]   We just grabbed a whole series.
[01:08:25.340 --> 01:08:28.340]   My son is a collector of, like, interesting sitcoms,
[01:08:28.340 --> 01:08:30.340]   especially ones that have been killed by Fox,
[01:08:30.340 --> 01:08:32.340]   not to mention, like, the serenity show.
[01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:33.340]   Fox kills all the best shows, actually.
[01:08:33.340 --> 01:08:34.340]   But the best one is Wonder Falls.
[01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:35.340]   Wonder.
[01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:36.340]   They only showed it for four weeks,
[01:08:36.340 --> 01:08:37.340]   and there's nine in the can.
[01:08:37.340 --> 01:08:39.340]   There's, like, 13 or 14 episodes.
[01:08:39.340 --> 01:08:41.340]   It is a terrific show.
[01:08:41.340 --> 01:08:42.340]   See, I don't think people are going to watch
[01:08:42.340 --> 01:08:43.340]   Network Television much longer.
[01:08:43.340 --> 01:08:45.340]   They're just going to watch the DVDs.
[01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:46.340]   We've already started with 24.
[01:08:46.340 --> 01:08:47.340]   We already...
[01:08:47.340 --> 01:08:49.340]   We've stopped watching it this year.
[01:08:49.340 --> 01:08:50.340]   We literally watched 24.
[01:08:50.340 --> 01:08:51.340]   No one wants a commercial.
[01:08:51.340 --> 01:08:53.340]   Once you've started watching shows without commercials,
[01:08:53.340 --> 01:08:54.340]   it's very hard to go back.
[01:08:54.340 --> 01:08:56.340]   Well, we still watch "Alyus" in real time,
[01:08:56.340 --> 01:08:58.340]   but I put it on the TV device,
[01:08:58.340 --> 01:09:00.340]   and then we plow through it,
[01:09:00.340 --> 01:09:02.340]   which is going to be surprising these guys.
[01:09:02.340 --> 01:09:05.340]   The best news for podcast advertising, that's what I say.
[01:09:05.340 --> 01:09:06.340]   Maybe.
[01:09:06.340 --> 01:09:09.340]   We have a little poll on our site for our listeners to see.
[01:09:09.340 --> 01:09:12.340]   I think that probably what we're going to move in that direction
[01:09:12.340 --> 01:09:14.340]   of adding some form of advertising.
[01:09:14.340 --> 01:09:15.340]   Like an underwriting.
[01:09:15.340 --> 01:09:16.340]   Underwriting.
[01:09:16.340 --> 01:09:18.340]   You'll never go away.
[01:09:18.340 --> 01:09:20.340]   We'll be right back after this word.
[01:09:20.340 --> 01:09:25.340]   We don't do it, but the future of advertising may be a lot of product placement.
[01:09:25.340 --> 01:09:26.340]   They say it's...
[01:09:26.340 --> 01:09:28.340]   How about another Coke, John?
[01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:29.340]   I thought it was pretty tasty.
[01:09:29.340 --> 01:09:31.340]   It was a lot better than Pepsi Leo.
[01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:32.340]   I don't like Pepsi.
[01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:33.340]   I never liked that.
[01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:34.340]   I like diet.
[01:09:34.340 --> 01:09:35.340]   It just tastes good.
[01:09:35.340 --> 01:09:36.340]   Zero calories.
[01:09:36.340 --> 01:09:37.340]   One, yet.
[01:09:37.340 --> 01:09:38.340]   Or zero.
[01:09:38.340 --> 01:09:43.340]   And by the way, that's a much better ad than 20 Super Bowl ads,
[01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:45.340]   because it makes you want a Coke.
[01:09:45.340 --> 01:09:46.340]   It would.
[01:09:46.340 --> 01:09:47.340]   It would.
[01:09:47.340 --> 01:09:48.340]   It requires some pretty good writing because I just watched...
[01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:49.340]   No, not with us.
[01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:51.340]   Well, if a broadcast tell-a-one...
[01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:52.340]   I'll give you an example.
[01:09:52.340 --> 01:09:53.340]   No one knows what the focus is about.
[01:09:53.340 --> 01:09:54.340]   It's a small note.
[01:09:54.340 --> 01:09:55.340]   I'll give you an example.
[01:09:55.340 --> 01:09:56.340]   That last time, I guess.
[01:09:56.340 --> 01:09:58.340]   So Robert Herren is about to buy a TV set, right?
[01:09:58.340 --> 01:10:00.340]   So what TV set are you going to buy?
[01:10:00.340 --> 01:10:01.340]   Well, let's see.
[01:10:01.340 --> 01:10:04.340]   See the minute he names that TV set, that's the best ad at the point.
[01:10:04.340 --> 01:10:05.340]   Is it money no on it?
[01:10:05.340 --> 01:10:06.340]   Especially that is only good.
[01:10:06.340 --> 01:10:07.340]   It's only good.
[01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:08.340]   You hear the price?
[01:10:08.340 --> 01:10:09.340]   It's the end.
[01:10:09.340 --> 01:10:10.340]   If you're going on and prattling on and on about television.
[01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:11.340]   We get established as expertizing.
[01:10:11.340 --> 01:10:14.340]   It's only good for the first couple of...
[01:10:14.340 --> 01:10:17.340]   As long as people feel like it's really what he wants to get, it's fine.
[01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:19.340]   We're not going to do that anyway.
[01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:20.340]   That's really a Ford.
[01:10:20.340 --> 01:10:25.340]   If you can't afford it, maybe it's like if Sam, somebody gave us a call and said, "Hey,
[01:10:25.340 --> 01:10:26.340]   take a look at this."
[01:10:26.340 --> 01:10:28.340]   Well, maybe 50 grand or unassent.
[01:10:28.340 --> 01:10:33.340]   I'd really ideally like to have advertisers like Coke that I don't conflict with what we talk about.
[01:10:33.340 --> 01:10:35.340]   Then there'd be no issue of editorial integrity.
[01:10:35.340 --> 01:10:40.340]   I'm looking for red bull or balls or somebody to come along and say, "Yeah."
[01:10:40.340 --> 01:10:41.340]   And then we'll talk faster.
[01:10:41.340 --> 01:10:42.340]   Energy drinks.
[01:10:42.340 --> 01:10:43.340]   Yeah, energy drinks.
[01:10:43.340 --> 01:10:44.340]   We'll talk faster.
[01:10:44.340 --> 01:10:45.340]   We'll talk faster.
[01:10:45.340 --> 01:10:46.340]   We'll get some drug companies involved.
[01:10:46.340 --> 01:10:51.340]   Anyway, take the poll because we do want to hear your feedback on that.
[01:10:51.340 --> 01:10:57.340]   First of all, somebody asked me, "Well, there's just a herald of change and it doesn't herald anything."
[01:10:57.340 --> 01:11:00.340]   We don't know if anybody's out there buying advertising yet on podcasts.
[01:11:00.340 --> 01:11:02.340]   I mean, it's just starting right now.
[01:11:02.340 --> 01:11:05.340]   We know that NPR sold it for a lot of money.
[01:11:05.340 --> 01:11:06.340]   Absolutely not.
[01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:07.340]   That's what we got to do with Jacked Up.
[01:11:07.340 --> 01:11:08.340]   That's what I thought.
[01:11:08.340 --> 01:11:09.340]   NPR.
[01:11:09.340 --> 01:11:10.340]   Wait a minute.
[01:11:10.340 --> 01:11:12.340]   I don't know what the amount was.
[01:11:12.340 --> 01:11:13.340]   It was significant.
[01:11:13.340 --> 01:11:14.340]   It was something like that.
[01:11:14.340 --> 01:11:15.340]   I love listening to NPR.
[01:11:15.340 --> 01:11:17.340]   It's something very calming about it in the morning.
[01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:18.340]   It's very calming.
[01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:23.340]   I think they do do classes and I was thinking of taking classes on how to talk like NPR.
[01:11:23.340 --> 01:11:24.340]   We could do that.
[01:11:24.340 --> 01:11:26.340]   We could take the BBC without the accent.
[01:11:26.340 --> 01:11:28.340]   Rule number one, don't talk over each other.
[01:11:28.340 --> 01:11:29.340]   Yeah.
[01:11:29.340 --> 01:11:30.340]   I'm terrible at that.
[01:11:30.340 --> 01:11:31.340]   Be very thoughtful.
[01:11:31.340 --> 01:11:32.340]   I think it would sound dreadful.
[01:11:32.340 --> 01:11:34.340]   I don't think this would be good.
[01:11:34.340 --> 01:11:35.340]   You have to listen to Daniel Shorter.
[01:11:35.340 --> 01:11:37.340]   It's not like the Gilmore Gang.
[01:11:37.340 --> 01:11:40.340]   Do you want to remind people about the Zeeam?
[01:11:40.340 --> 01:11:42.340]   We got to sign up ready to go.
[01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:44.340]   Let's publicize this sign up.
[01:11:44.340 --> 01:11:47.340]   Have you checked lately to see if anybody has signed up yet?
[01:11:47.340 --> 01:11:48.340]   I can.
[01:11:48.340 --> 01:11:49.340]   Why don't you see how many spaces?
[01:11:49.340 --> 01:11:52.340]   We haven't really talked about it very much.
[01:11:52.340 --> 01:11:53.340]   I think that it's been...
[01:11:53.340 --> 01:11:56.340]   Well, I might have mentioned it somewhere on my radio shows.
[01:11:56.340 --> 01:11:58.340]   Well, people should go anyway.
[01:11:58.340 --> 01:11:59.340]   Here's the deal.
[01:11:59.340 --> 01:12:01.340]   If it's sold out, you can get on the wait list.
[01:12:01.340 --> 01:12:04.340]   If it's shorter, what we're going to do is we're going to open up the doors.
[01:12:04.340 --> 01:12:06.340]   If you're not there by 6.30, we start at 7.
[01:12:06.340 --> 01:12:09.340]   If you're not there by 6.30, you're going to open the doors.
[01:12:09.340 --> 01:12:10.340]   Are we charging to this?
[01:12:10.340 --> 01:12:12.340]   No, we don't charge five bucks.
[01:12:12.340 --> 01:12:13.340]   We should.
[01:12:13.340 --> 01:12:16.340]   It's costing us money to actually pay for staff at the Zeeam.
[01:12:16.340 --> 01:12:18.340]   We'll have a donation box.
[01:12:18.340 --> 01:12:19.340]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:12:19.340 --> 01:12:20.340]   Here's the deal.
[01:12:20.340 --> 01:12:21.340]   If you want to give us church, come on.
[01:12:21.340 --> 01:12:22.340]   We'll pass the hatch.
[01:12:22.340 --> 01:12:23.340]   We'll pass the hatch.
[01:12:23.340 --> 01:12:25.340]   Why don't we have a guy with a stick and a box on the end?
[01:12:25.340 --> 01:12:26.340]   I love that.
[01:12:26.340 --> 01:12:28.340]   You ever get one that jingles it in front of you?
[01:12:28.340 --> 01:12:29.340]   Yeah.
[01:12:29.340 --> 01:12:30.340]   It's a great deal.
[01:12:30.340 --> 01:12:31.340]   It's probably Oregon and the locals.
[01:12:31.340 --> 01:12:32.340]   So, interlude.
[01:12:32.340 --> 01:12:33.340]   But if you go to...
[01:12:33.340 --> 01:12:34.340]   It's in the...
[01:12:34.340 --> 01:12:35.340]   It's pixacord.com.
[01:12:35.340 --> 01:12:37.340]   Let's just go to pixacord.com and click the events on the left.
[01:12:37.340 --> 01:12:38.340]   Yeah, and you just sign up.
[01:12:38.340 --> 01:12:39.340]   It's one of the events.
[01:12:39.340 --> 01:12:41.340]   And we'll put you on a waiting list if it's...
[01:12:41.340 --> 01:12:42.340]   So, just sign up.
[01:12:42.340 --> 01:12:43.340]   It fills up.
[01:12:43.340 --> 01:12:44.340]   Just sign up.
[01:12:44.340 --> 01:12:46.340]   And it will tell you that it's sold out if you get there.
[01:12:46.340 --> 01:12:47.340]   Please don't sign up unless...
[01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:48.340]   You're really coming.
[01:12:48.340 --> 01:12:51.340]   You're really going to be at Mac World Expo January 10th.
[01:12:51.340 --> 01:12:52.340]   It's Tuesday.
[01:12:52.340 --> 01:12:53.340]   It's Tuesday.
[01:12:53.340 --> 01:12:57.340]   You should have a formula for overage because there will be an X number of people.
[01:12:57.340 --> 01:12:58.340]   We have a formula for overage.
[01:12:58.340 --> 01:13:00.340]   Yes, they know how to do that kind of thing.
[01:13:00.340 --> 01:13:01.340]   These guys have got it.
[01:13:01.340 --> 01:13:02.340]   Yeah.
[01:13:02.340 --> 01:13:04.340]   And it's the day of Steve Jobs keynote.
[01:13:04.340 --> 01:13:06.340]   So, I presume we have much to talk about.
[01:13:06.340 --> 01:13:10.340]   We're going to get some Apple experts to come by and some other interesting people are going to...
[01:13:10.340 --> 01:13:11.340]   I think I'm out that week.
[01:13:11.340 --> 01:13:12.340]   I'm going to Tahoe.
[01:13:12.340 --> 01:13:14.340]   Oh, we covered from SES.
[01:13:14.340 --> 01:13:15.340]   Yes.
[01:13:15.340 --> 01:13:16.340]   That would be exactly...
[01:13:16.340 --> 01:13:18.340]   No, I don't know what we're going to do for CES coverage next week,
[01:13:18.340 --> 01:13:21.340]   but I think we might do a Skype from CES because you're going to be the CES show floor.
[01:13:21.340 --> 01:13:25.340]   Maybe John and I will be home and you and Norton...
[01:13:25.340 --> 01:13:26.340]   I'll be cleaning my office.
[01:13:26.340 --> 01:13:29.340]   Yeah, John will be cleaning his office and we'll get a progress report.
[01:13:29.340 --> 01:13:31.340]   So, we'll do that one by Skype and then we'll be live...
[01:13:31.340 --> 01:13:33.340]   I'll be needing January 10th.
[01:13:33.340 --> 01:13:35.340]   I have some tidbits from this museum.
[01:13:35.340 --> 01:13:38.340]   I want to thank our friends at AOL Radio.
[01:13:38.340 --> 01:13:39.340]   This is the one commercial we do.
[01:13:39.340 --> 01:13:40.340]   It's kind of like a commercial.
[01:13:40.340 --> 01:13:41.340]   It's not really.
[01:13:41.340 --> 01:13:42.340]   I'm going to pay money for it.
[01:13:42.340 --> 01:13:43.340]   It provides a fan with it.
[01:13:43.340 --> 01:13:44.340]   It's a big thank you.
[01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:47.340]   The role that Delta Airlines provided transportation.
[01:13:47.340 --> 01:13:49.340]   It's like that.
[01:13:49.340 --> 01:13:55.340]   Support for this podcast provided by AOL Radio at AOLMusic.com.
[01:13:55.340 --> 01:13:57.340]   I listen, so should you.
[01:13:57.340 --> 01:13:59.340]   Keep on there.
[01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:00.340]   How much is that?
[01:14:00.340 --> 01:14:02.340]   How much is that?
[01:14:02.340 --> 01:14:04.340]   It's more than the price of admission.
[01:14:04.340 --> 01:14:06.340]   Now, they're very kindly provided us with a bandwidth.
[01:14:06.340 --> 01:14:09.340]   Anything else that we need, any business that we need to take care of?
[01:14:09.340 --> 01:14:10.340]   I think that's it.
[01:14:10.340 --> 01:14:11.340]   Kenji has been great having you.
[01:14:11.340 --> 01:14:12.340]   Thank you.
[01:14:12.340 --> 01:14:14.340]   Good luck with the Center for Homeland Defense and Security.
[01:14:14.340 --> 01:14:15.340]   One of my many projects.
[01:14:15.340 --> 01:14:16.340]   What else do you do?
[01:14:16.340 --> 01:14:18.340]   I actually have my own company also.
[01:14:18.340 --> 01:14:19.340]   Edge Runner.
[01:14:19.340 --> 01:14:20.340]   Edge Runner.
[01:14:20.340 --> 01:14:24.340]   We do technology and stuff like that.
[01:14:24.340 --> 01:14:26.340]   And of course Alex Lindsey with the Pixel Core.
[01:14:26.340 --> 01:14:29.340]   Thank you for your help and thanks to the Pixel Core folks who've been...
[01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:32.340]   How do you like the fact that there's nothing behind us?
[01:14:32.340 --> 01:14:33.340]   It compresses well.
[01:14:33.340 --> 01:14:34.340]   Yeah, it really compresses well.
[01:14:34.340 --> 01:14:37.340]   And I really want to thank the Golden Gate Studios.
[01:14:37.340 --> 01:14:39.340]   Golden Gate Productions who provided us with the...
[01:14:39.340 --> 01:14:41.340]   This is such an awesome stage.
[01:14:41.340 --> 01:14:46.340]   And if people are in, especially in the Bay Area thinking about this kind of work, it's just such a fantastic question.
[01:14:46.340 --> 01:14:48.340]   This has always been a good place to see stuff.
[01:14:48.340 --> 01:14:50.340]   It's a TV station, so it's really like, you know, we really have...
[01:14:50.340 --> 01:14:51.340]   It's not a TV station.
[01:14:51.340 --> 01:14:52.340]   It's not a TV station.
[01:14:52.340 --> 01:14:56.340]   We've got great lights and we've gotten great support and we really appreciate the help that Golden Gate has been on.
[01:14:56.340 --> 01:14:57.340]   That's the monkey cam.
[01:14:57.340 --> 01:15:01.340]   Did you manage to get one of the video files down to like something like under 80 Macs?
[01:15:01.340 --> 01:15:03.340]   I heard people raving about it.
[01:15:03.340 --> 01:15:05.340]   Almost the same size as the audio.
[01:15:05.340 --> 01:15:06.340]   I sat down.
[01:15:06.340 --> 01:15:07.340]   I sat down.
[01:15:07.340 --> 01:15:08.340]   I downloaded the wrong file.
[01:15:08.340 --> 01:15:09.340]   I sat down.
[01:15:09.340 --> 01:15:11.340]   The black really makes a big difference.
[01:15:11.340 --> 01:15:13.340]   We expect this one to be pretty small.
[01:15:13.340 --> 01:15:14.340]   Yeah, this one should be pretty small.
[01:15:14.340 --> 01:15:16.340]   Also I got really aggressive.
[01:15:16.340 --> 01:15:17.340]   I'm going to probably do a tutorial.
[01:15:17.340 --> 01:15:20.340]   I'm going to start doing tutorials next year.
[01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:26.340]   We're going to start doing tutorials next year that we're going to put up on related to Twitch
[01:15:26.340 --> 01:15:28.340]   as to how we're doing different pieces.
[01:15:28.340 --> 01:15:29.340]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:15:29.340 --> 01:15:30.340]   We got into...
[01:15:30.340 --> 01:15:34.340]   I really got into compression, so I spent a couple hours playing around with it.
[01:15:34.340 --> 01:15:40.340]   What I do is I compress one minute and then multiply it by it so I know how big it's going to be in the play with it and I decide how good it is.
[01:15:40.340 --> 01:15:41.340]   So I got it all the way down.
[01:15:41.340 --> 01:15:44.340]   The big thing was just increasing temporal compression.
[01:15:44.340 --> 01:15:46.340]   So anyway, with the black it works really well.
[01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:48.340]   We're working for a megabyte a minute.
[01:15:48.340 --> 01:15:49.340]   That's our goal.
[01:15:49.340 --> 01:15:50.340]   That's when we know we've made it.
[01:15:50.340 --> 01:15:52.340]   That's pretty darn good.
[01:15:52.340 --> 01:15:53.340]   That's not good.
[01:15:53.340 --> 01:15:58.340]   But even the big one, the 640x480 was...
[01:15:58.340 --> 01:16:02.340]   We're not very far from megabit for the iPod version.
[01:16:02.340 --> 01:16:05.340]   The H.264 was only like 150 megs.
[01:16:05.340 --> 01:16:07.340]   So the first one we did was 700.
[01:16:07.340 --> 01:16:08.340]   That's a good word.
[01:16:08.340 --> 01:16:10.340]   That's like the one horsepower per cue.
[01:16:10.340 --> 01:16:11.340]   It still looks pretty good.
[01:16:11.340 --> 01:16:14.340]   There are a lot of people who would love to know how that's done.
[01:16:14.340 --> 01:16:15.340]   I'll put it up.
[01:16:15.340 --> 01:16:17.340]   We're getting there and we will tell the world.
[01:16:17.340 --> 01:16:19.340]   Thank you everybody for being here.
[01:16:19.340 --> 01:16:20.340]   Stay out of the rain.
[01:16:20.340 --> 01:16:21.340]   Happy New Year.
[01:16:21.340 --> 01:16:22.340]   Another Twitch.
[01:16:22.340 --> 01:16:23.340]   In the can.
[01:16:23.340 --> 01:16:26.340]   We've never got the predictions.
[01:16:26.340 --> 01:16:27.340]   We tried.
[01:16:27.340 --> 01:16:28.340]   Did you have some predictions?
[01:16:28.340 --> 01:16:29.340]   I had one.
[01:16:29.340 --> 01:16:30.340]   Well, what's your prediction?
[01:16:30.340 --> 01:16:31.340]   Why is this HD?
[01:16:31.340 --> 01:16:32.340]   You know, being able to train people.
[01:16:32.340 --> 01:16:34.340]   You think they don't happen to CES?
[01:16:34.340 --> 01:16:35.340]   I hope so.
[01:16:35.340 --> 01:16:36.340]   They showed it once.
[01:16:36.340 --> 01:16:37.340]   They showed it once.
[01:16:37.340 --> 01:16:39.340]   They're demonstrating a couple of different proprietary technologies.
[01:16:39.340 --> 01:16:41.340]   But I think doing it over like a G network or a super G network.
[01:16:41.340 --> 01:16:42.340]   They've got to be very cool.
[01:16:42.340 --> 01:16:44.340]   But weren't they doing it wasn't there?
[01:16:44.340 --> 01:16:45.340]   The bandwidth's there.
[01:16:45.340 --> 01:16:48.340]   So do the LG or somebody do that a couple of years ago?
[01:16:48.340 --> 01:16:51.340]   I think if they do it digitally you're going to run into all the DIM.
[01:16:51.340 --> 01:16:53.340]   That'd be so scared of these.
[01:16:53.340 --> 01:16:55.340]   That's why you're in there.
[01:16:55.340 --> 01:16:57.340]   I say wireless iPod in January.
[01:16:57.340 --> 01:16:58.340]   Wireless iPod?
[01:16:58.340 --> 01:16:59.340]   I'm hoping.
[01:16:59.340 --> 01:17:00.340]   Wireless what?
[01:17:00.340 --> 01:17:01.340]   My wireless to what?
[01:17:01.340 --> 01:17:05.340]   Like I can walk into Starbucks and download movies under my iPod.
[01:17:05.340 --> 01:17:07.340]   I want an iPod A with an FM radio.
[01:17:07.340 --> 01:17:09.340]   You can do that on Audible with the audio.
[01:17:09.340 --> 01:17:10.340]   It's on the phone of home.
[01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:12.340]   If you download it you can download it.
[01:17:12.340 --> 01:17:13.340]   Right.
[01:17:13.340 --> 01:17:14.340]   Audible's doing that.
[01:17:14.340 --> 01:17:15.340]   What's this?
