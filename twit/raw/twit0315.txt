[00:01:38.400 --> 00:01:42.120]   This week in tech, the show that covers you tech news of the weekend.
[00:01:42.120 --> 00:01:43.640]   Boy, we have a great panel here.
[00:01:43.640 --> 00:01:45.040]   And I think that's partly because we're
[00:01:45.040 --> 00:01:47.000]   about to have a great big party here.
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:48.840]   That's how we got Barretunde Thurston to come up.
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:49.200]   That's a party.
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.120]   The party away from New York, New York.
[00:01:51.120 --> 00:01:52.480]   It's great for Brooklyn, I should say.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.080]   Here to help celebrate Nick Milton's birthday.
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:55.640]   Are you really?
[00:01:55.640 --> 00:01:56.120]   Yeah.
[00:01:56.120 --> 00:01:57.400]   So it was his birthday party.
[00:01:57.400 --> 00:01:57.900]   Yeah.
[00:01:57.900 --> 00:01:58.840]   Oh, that's great.
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:00.240]   Nick Milton is also here from New York Times.
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:02.240]   He's moved here from New York to New York to New York.
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:02.640]   That's right.
[00:02:02.640 --> 00:02:03.840]   I'm a San Franciscan now.
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:04.320]   Welcome.
[00:02:04.320 --> 00:02:04.640]   Is that right?
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:05.160]   Is that how you say it?
[00:02:05.160 --> 00:02:06.000]   San Franciscan.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Yep.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:08.280]   OK, just don't say Frisco.
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.000]   OK, I'm not a Frisco.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.520]   Can't do that.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:10.920]   No.
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:11.840]   But it's nice.
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:13.760]   Why did you move?
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:14.320]   It doesn't matter.
[00:02:14.320 --> 00:02:15.280]   I guess we were better.
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:17.360]   Well, I'm single now.
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:19.040]   So that was part of it.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:21.520]   And also, I've been covering tech
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:22.960]   from the times for a couple of years in New York.
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:23.960]   We thought it'd be a good change today.
[00:02:23.960 --> 00:02:24.720]   It's good to have somebody out here.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.080]   Come out here and go down to Apple's campus and annoy them.
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:31.000]   What about all the East Coast tech?
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:31.560]   What's that?
[00:02:31.560 --> 00:02:33.080]   What about all the East Coast tech?
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:34.680]   Wang and digital.
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.160]   Route 128 coverage, courtesy Paul Therat.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:39.680]   From our Windows Weekly show.
[00:02:39.680 --> 00:02:41.080]   And of course, the Windows--
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:42.840]   Super site for Windows, win Super site.com.
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.800]   It's great to have you here.
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:44.360]   Thank you, sir.
[00:02:44.360 --> 00:02:47.360]   I think it's everybody's first time in the Brick House today.
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.960]   And also from New York, Peter Rojas.
[00:02:48.960 --> 00:02:50.880]   It's kind of the East Coast edition.
[00:02:50.880 --> 00:02:51.600]   Thanks for having me.
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:53.320]   GDGT, and I right behind you.
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.800]   I think-- no, you can't see him in the shot,
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:56.840]   but Ryan Block your partners here.
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.600]   And it's great to have you.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.920]   We might tag out.
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:01.000]   You could tag out.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.040]   You could tag out.
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:02.760]   There's his hand.
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:04.280]   You could see the top of his head and his hand.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.440]   I need help on this topic.
[00:03:05.440 --> 00:03:07.320]   Veronica Block's it right next to me.
[00:03:07.320 --> 00:03:08.400]   We are having a big party.
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:10.960]   Our grand opening party is at right after Twitch.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:13.920]   So I think that's part of one of the reasons people--
[00:03:13.920 --> 00:03:15.240]   we're getting so many people here.
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:16.360]   We liked Party.
[00:03:16.360 --> 00:03:18.200]   We got about 50 people in the audience today.
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:18.720]   We liked Party Party.
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:21.320]   In fact, we're going to burn through this show specifically
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:22.240]   so we can get to it.
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:25.480]   Thanks very much for joining us, and we'll see you next time.
[00:03:25.480 --> 00:03:29.040]   This was a-- August, I usually think of August as a slow week
[00:03:29.040 --> 00:03:31.320]   for news, a slow month for news.
[00:03:31.320 --> 00:03:32.640]   But this was not a slow week.
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.320]   No, this was absolutely not.
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.080]   Amy means.
[00:03:34.080 --> 00:03:34.560]   But it's something--
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:35.480]   Absolutely not.
[00:03:35.480 --> 00:03:36.200]   A couple of things.
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.880]   Let's start with Monday.
[00:03:37.880 --> 00:03:39.240]   We're going to play by then.
[00:03:39.240 --> 00:03:41.240]   We're going to play by hour.
[00:03:41.240 --> 00:03:42.840]   Yeah, practically.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:47.400]   Big shock, really before even the market opened on Monday,
[00:03:47.400 --> 00:03:49.800]   Larry Page announced that Google had spent $12 and a half
[00:03:49.800 --> 00:03:52.960]   billion and purchased Motorola Mobility.
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.360]   That's correct.
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.080]   A shock for anybody here?
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.880]   A shock for me.
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:57.920]   Did you expect that, Peter?
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.640]   Yeah, I mean, I was surprised.
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:02.000]   It's a big deal because they're buying a hardware company.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.040]   Even if they bought it for the patents or whatever reason,
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:06.960]   I mean, the fact that Google, which has always
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:11.120]   been about software and services, would get so directly
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:13.080]   into the hardware business, is a really big move.
[00:04:13.080 --> 00:04:15.400]   It's a big change for how Google thinks about itself
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.920]   as a company.
[00:04:15.920 --> 00:04:18.840]   Some people positive that perhaps there's a message--
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.240]   Microsoft partnering with Nokia.
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:23.280]   Apple owns their hardware business
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:25.520]   that maybe if you want to make it in smartphones,
[00:04:25.520 --> 00:04:28.000]   you need to have a hardware partner or be in the hardware
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.400]   business, that doesn't seem--
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:31.560]   do you think that's true?
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:31.960]   And not for Android.
[00:04:31.960 --> 00:04:34.120]   Android's advantage is so many manufacturers.
[00:04:34.120 --> 00:04:36.960]   Well, I mean, there's an argument to be made, right?
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:39.000]   The counter argument is that it didn't work very well
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:40.720]   for Palm and then HP.
[00:04:40.720 --> 00:04:43.040]   We'll get to that in a moment.
[00:04:43.040 --> 00:04:43.680]   But I think--
[00:04:43.680 --> 00:04:44.840]   Remember, that was Thursday.
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.000]   Spoiler alert.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   That was Thursday.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.160]   No one Monday.
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.720]   No.
[00:04:49.720 --> 00:04:50.680]   Or did they?
[00:04:50.680 --> 00:04:52.120]   Yeah, I mean, it is--
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:54.000]   it's about a battle of ecosystems, right?
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.440]   And it's about a battle of who can create the best
[00:04:57.440 --> 00:04:58.160]   experience.
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:04:59.720]   And creating a great experience really
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.320]   means you have to not just create good hardware or great
[00:05:02.320 --> 00:05:02.680]   software.
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:05.040]   You have to really integrate those two things together
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:06.600]   in a way that consumers are going
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:10.400]   to have an amazing problem-free experience most of the time.
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:11.880]   It's a risk, though, to Google, isn't it?
[00:05:11.880 --> 00:05:14.880]   That the Samsung and LG and all these people
[00:05:14.880 --> 00:05:15.760]   will get pissed off?
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.240]   I mean, what Apple does is hardware software,
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:20.960]   but at the end of the day, they're a hardware company.
[00:05:20.960 --> 00:05:22.200]   And they'll say that.
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.760]   And at the end of the day, Google is an advertising company.
[00:05:25.760 --> 00:05:26.880]   Not even a software company.
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:28.080]   Not even a software company.
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:29.280]   And you can see that from Android.
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:33.240]   I mean, Android is-- although it is the number one mobile
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.280]   service right now, it's a mess.
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:38.240]   They're doing what Windows did a decade ago.
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:40.960]   And I think that it's going to be really, really difficult
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:43.680]   for them to take over Motorola and integrate it
[00:05:43.680 --> 00:05:46.160]   and create great products in the next few years
[00:05:46.160 --> 00:05:48.440]   without shooting themselves in the foot at the same time.
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.560]   It was about patents.
[00:05:49.560 --> 00:05:51.600]   Wasn't it Paul really, ultimately?
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.880]   Yeah, in fact, I expect them to get rid of the hardware
[00:05:53.880 --> 00:05:54.560]   a bit eventually.
[00:05:54.560 --> 00:05:55.080]   It's been at all.
[00:05:55.080 --> 00:05:55.520]   They don't need it.
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:57.280]   And it actually hurts their relationships
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:58.080]   with their partners.
[00:05:58.080 --> 00:05:59.120]   Absolutely.
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:01.400]   Google had about 1,000 patents going into this.
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:02.960]   They missed out on the no-tell patents.
[00:06:02.960 --> 00:06:05.640]   Apple and Microsoft made an unholy alliance
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:06.720]   to swoop those--
[00:06:06.720 --> 00:06:06.920]   Kabal, I think.
[00:06:06.920 --> 00:06:08.320]   Kabal, with you.
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:10.360]   The term we used to--
[00:06:10.360 --> 00:06:13.600]   On the hardware side, I do hope that they
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:16.960]   bring back the Skypager.
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:18.680]   Because it's just a great device.
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:19.160]   You're kidding me.
[00:06:19.160 --> 00:06:20.560]   And a Star-Tac phone.
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:24.320]   And I think those were two excellently executed devices
[00:06:24.320 --> 00:06:25.680]   that really saved the world.
[00:06:25.680 --> 00:06:28.360]   You're suddenly making the point that Motorola mobility
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:30.360]   hasn't really been on cutting edge for a while.
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.040]   I don't mean to dis-moderola.
[00:06:32.040 --> 00:06:34.120]   But I do think that those devices were actually really cool.
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:35.080]   I love the Star-Tac.
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:37.760]   In terms of the patent thing, I joked earlier this week,
[00:06:37.760 --> 00:06:39.360]   I didn't-- how many tech writers
[00:06:39.360 --> 00:06:41.600]   got into this business to write about patent law?
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:41.920]   Right.
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.040]   And suddenly we are.
[00:06:43.040 --> 00:06:44.240]   And it's just-- it's really--
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.840]   I'm not even a full-fledged tech writer.
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:48.480]   I'm an enthusiast, and I love to talk about this stuff.
[00:06:48.480 --> 00:06:50.360]   But patents know.
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:51.720]   These guys should just fight.
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:53.400]   They should go out into a little bit of desert
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:56.800]   with a sword, some kind of broad sword, a sigh,
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:06:58.440]   there's something, and just have it out.
[00:06:58.440 --> 00:07:00.640]   And Larry Page and Steve Ballmer go at each other's throats.
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.800]   And whoever wins gets the thing that they're fighting over.
[00:07:03.800 --> 00:07:04.720]   If it is about patents--
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:06.560]   I wouldn't want to go up against that guy in a desert.
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.240]   Oh, no, I'm not.
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:09.240]   He's a Brimmer-Germot warrior suit.
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:09.740]   Pitch?
[00:07:09.740 --> 00:07:11.640]   He's a big guy.
[00:07:11.640 --> 00:07:14.440]   But he's a quick, size alone.
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:16.360]   I feel like Larry Page is a little squirrely.
[00:07:16.360 --> 00:07:17.360]   Or Larry Page.
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.920]   And he's sitting there and suffocating.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:21.640]   So in a battle, this is what I wanted
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:23.360]   to bring our discussion to.
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:26.440]   One, who did not talk about patents, sort of a--
[00:07:26.440 --> 00:07:27.240]   Physical common.
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:27.640]   I did win.
[00:07:27.640 --> 00:07:29.000]   I like the sword thing.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.600]   You forgot to mention Razor.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:31.120]   I did.
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.240]   I didn't forget to mention Razor.
[00:07:32.240 --> 00:07:33.200]   The sword and a razor?
[00:07:33.200 --> 00:07:34.080]   No, the razor, the--
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.280]   The foundable razor.
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:37.160]   Oh, it was a great phone to a razor.
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:41.080]   I mean, when they put Android on that, it's going to be epic.
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.120]   So it will be 2.2.
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:43.880]   It's about patents.
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.360]   It's about mutually assured destruction.
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:50.800]   Having now what 12,000 patents to counter anybody
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:51.720]   who wants to come off--
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:52.960]   I don't think it's just about patents.
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:53.320]   No?
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.440]   I don't think it's just about patents.
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:57.160]   I think it's also about them being really concerned
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:59.280]   about Android's long-term prospects.
[00:07:59.280 --> 00:08:01.640]   Well, there weren't many if you get sued to death, right?
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.320]   And Apple's going after Samsung saying,
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:06.120]   you can't sell products in the US
[00:08:06.120 --> 00:08:08.960]   because you're copying our phones.
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:10.720]   And I think that's preliminary suing Google.
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:12.320]   Or maybe they'll just sue everybody around?
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:13.680]   They're going to sue everyone around.
[00:08:13.680 --> 00:08:15.720]   And then I think the frustrating thing
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:17.400]   is that Google missed a really big opportunity
[00:08:17.400 --> 00:08:20.440]   with the whole Nortell thing to come out and say, look,
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:22.640]   this patent system is fundamentally broken.
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.000]   We're only playing this game because we have to.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:27.760]   And we're going to start putting our efforts into lobbying
[00:08:27.760 --> 00:08:30.640]   Congress to change and reform the patent system.
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.200]   That's what came to my mind is there's $12.5 billion.
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:36.400]   Just basically thrown away that could have been used
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:39.320]   for all sorts of innovation because you had to defend
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:40.480]   yourself against patent law.
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:41.960]   You were buying every member of Congress.
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:43.640]   Well, how much could they be worth?
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:44.680]   Like 1,000 each?
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:46.480]   Well, there's 5-- well, 538 of them.
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:48.280]   And then you take-- you divide-- like, yeah,
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:50.200]   give each of them half a billion.
[00:08:50.200 --> 00:08:51.000]   That's a cover.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:51.600]   That's a cover.
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.960]   A couple of years there.
[00:08:52.960 --> 00:08:55.800]   The problem-- this is a much, much bigger problem
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:08:58.560]   that the patent law just doesn't cover.
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.040]   Like software and--
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:02.600]   I mean, the patents for the ones that exist to--
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.680]   if I slide my finger across my phone to unlock it,
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:07.120]   that should be really given a patent.
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:08.200]   I mean, come on.
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.560]   There are thousands of these things
[00:09:09.560 --> 00:09:12.960]   that exist for just the most esoteric little things
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:13.960]   on a mobile device.
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:16.240]   And I don't think the patent office is any concept
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:17.560]   of what the hell is going on right now.
[00:09:17.560 --> 00:09:19.280]   Can we patent walking by the way?
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:21.920]   I'm sure somebody's trying for someone to patent a toast.
[00:09:21.920 --> 00:09:22.600]   Did that really?
[00:09:22.600 --> 00:09:23.920]   Yeah, a couple years ago.
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:24.840]   A couple years ago?
[00:09:24.840 --> 00:09:25.320]   Yeah.
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:26.160]   Does that mean I have to send them--
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:28.920]   What patent examiner would look at a patent application
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:30.640]   for toast and approve it?
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.040]   Well, you know what they do is they just
[00:09:32.040 --> 00:09:33.720]   look to see if it's there already.
[00:09:33.720 --> 00:09:36.120]   Nobody's done toast before.
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:36.560]   Why?
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:37.480]   This is brilliant.
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.920]   I have a patent.
[00:09:38.920 --> 00:09:39.420]   No.
[00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:40.360]   What's your patent?
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:40.840]   My patent is--
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:41.720]   So you're part of the problem.
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:42.800]   I'm part of the problem.
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:44.200]   Nick, Bill, and the client.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:45.840]   We knew that already.
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:46.360]   Come on.
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.920]   Thanks, guys.
[00:09:48.920 --> 00:09:50.600]   I have a patent for--
[00:09:50.600 --> 00:09:53.800]   if you have an RFID on your phone and an RFID
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:55.120]   on your computer, that when they connect,
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:57.360]   that they can communicate with each other
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:09:58.120]   and send information back.
[00:09:58.120 --> 00:09:58.880]   Now, did you--
[00:09:58.880 --> 00:09:59.520]   to do this patent--
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:09:59.720]   Do it this way.
[00:09:59.720 --> 00:10:02.040]   --you just merely have a concept and patent it,
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:03.360]   or did you have a prototype?
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:04.280]   Built a prototype.
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:05.640]   So that's what it used to be.
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:08.640]   You'd have to build something and show the process
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.560]   at work, and that is a much better way, I think,
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:13.320]   of making patents work.
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.240]   Yeah, we did it with the New York Times.
[00:10:15.240 --> 00:10:16.480]   As an experiment?
[00:10:16.480 --> 00:10:18.200]   Why used to work in the research labs?
[00:10:18.200 --> 00:10:19.960]   And we prototyped all this stuff,
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:22.760]   and so we had this idea of content following you around.
[00:10:22.760 --> 00:10:26.120]   So let's say you're reading an article on your laptop,
[00:10:26.120 --> 00:10:27.800]   and you don't finish it, and you pick up your phone
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:28.320]   and walk away.
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:28.720]   Love that idea.
[00:10:28.720 --> 00:10:30.520]   The RFID chip would say, hey, you left.
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:32.040]   Is that in the rest of the article on his phone?
[00:10:32.040 --> 00:10:34.920]   By the way, that is one thing that Motorola did have,
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:37.880]   not only patents in, but also some products,
[00:10:37.880 --> 00:10:39.640]   is NFC, near-field communication.
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:42.120]   So and that's something Google's very interested in promoting.
[00:10:42.120 --> 00:10:43.680]   So that might be some value.
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:44.960]   Set top boxes also.
[00:10:44.960 --> 00:10:48.280]   They're one of two big set top box companies.
[00:10:48.280 --> 00:10:49.560]   Paul and I talked about this on Windows.
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:50.720]   We love Motorola.
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.280]   Love them.
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:51.760]   Terrible.
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.080]   This stuff is crap.
[00:10:53.080 --> 00:10:56.320]   Only made worse by scientific Atlanta, right?
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:56.840]   Yeah.
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:10:58.040]   I mean, these bars are very loud.
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:10:59.360]   The bars are very loud.
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:10:59.880]   Very loud.
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:01.280]   Yeah.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:04.720]   There doesn't seem like any way that they could put Google TV
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:05.520]   into these boxes.
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:06.440]   What's Google TV?
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:11.200]   $300 later, you explain.
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:13.560]   I mean, I think the problem is that when it comes to set top boxes,
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:14.960]   it's not a consumer device.
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:15.720]   Thank you.
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:17.400]   The people that are buying these are the--
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.640]   Cable companies buy it.
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:21.080]   And so if you're just something that cable companies don't like,
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:23.080]   if you put some software on it, they're not happy about,
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:24.240]   they're just going to not buy them.
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:24.880]   Google TV.
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:25.520]   They'll kill you.
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:26.520]   Right.
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.200]   The last thing they want is for Google TV
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:29.880]   to get in between them and their relationship
[00:11:29.880 --> 00:11:31.160]   with their advertisers.
[00:11:31.160 --> 00:11:32.560]   That's the first thing we want, of course,
[00:11:32.560 --> 00:11:34.240]   because it's the last thing they want.
[00:11:34.240 --> 00:11:35.040]   Yes.
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:37.920]   It's again, size time.
[00:11:37.920 --> 00:11:39.280]   I think swords--
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.320]   Swords--
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:40.800]   Razors.
[00:11:40.800 --> 00:11:41.560]   Razors.
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:42.840]   That's what I thought he was talking about.
[00:11:42.840 --> 00:11:43.360]   Swords and Razors.
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:43.880]   A weapon.
[00:11:43.880 --> 00:11:44.400]   There we go.
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:45.000]   As a weapon.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.800]   Use your razor as a weapon.
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:48.760]   Anything else to say about Motorola?
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:49.280]   Motorola.
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:51.440]   Is that the name that we've decided on?
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.040]   I think that dramatically.
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:53.640]   Google Rollers.
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:54.040]   The Motorola.
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:54.600]   Google Rollers.
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:56.600]   It sounds like a roller rink.
[00:11:56.600 --> 00:11:57.240]   Google Rollers.
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:11:57.600]   I'm sorry.
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:59.600]   When you had Google Rollers, what comes out on the other side?
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:03.640]   Google Rollers sounds like a late in the TV host is for horror movies.
[00:12:03.640 --> 00:12:05.240]   Hi, I'm Google Rollers.
[00:12:05.240 --> 00:12:06.440]   It's so specific.
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:08.840]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.640]   I'm in the rich fantasy world.
[00:12:10.640 --> 00:12:14.040]   That's all I'm going to say about that right now.
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:15.080]   Google Rela.
[00:12:15.080 --> 00:12:15.880]   See, that's--
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:16.360]   That's how--
[00:12:16.360 --> 00:12:17.520]   Google Rela would be a band.
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:20.400]   Japanese monster movie.
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:22.920]   So do they rename the razor the "graser"?
[00:12:22.920 --> 00:12:23.800]   Ooh.
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:26.200]   And that's the step too far.
[00:12:26.200 --> 00:12:27.240]   Everybody was OK.
[00:12:27.240 --> 00:12:29.440]   The Goutak.
[00:12:29.440 --> 00:12:31.440]   Oh, god.
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:33.320]   All right, we're just going to stop with this.
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:35.960]   I'm winning the Giants next on Sci-Fi.
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:36.800]   Google Rollers.
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:37.600]   It takes a lot.
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:38.640]   Yeah, right.
[00:12:38.640 --> 00:12:39.920]   I'll take a break, come back with more.
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.000]   We've got a great team here.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.080]   And it's so nice when we do this stuff live in studio,
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:45.440]   because people can actually see each other.
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:46.120]   And I just love it.
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.240]   I can punch each other.
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:47.840]   Punch each other.
[00:12:47.840 --> 00:12:48.320]   And later--
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:48.840]   Sword fight.
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:49.840]   There will be a--
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:50.760]   Late at the party.
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:51.280]   Yeah.
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.280]   At the party.
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:52.720]   Throw it out.
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:54.720]   You know, we bought a giant disco ball.
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:55.200]   Oh, my god.
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.400]   We're not going to have Google Rela.
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:56.960]   We are.
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:58.320]   We have it right in the kitchen there.
[00:12:58.320 --> 00:12:59.560]   There's a giant disco ball.
[00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:02.040]   In fact, that kitchen is exactly like a disco.
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:03.240]   There it is.
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.600]   And it's like the Times Square.
[00:13:05.600 --> 00:13:06.280]   Are you going to drop it?
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:07.280]   Is it in a barn?
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:08.280]   Is it in a barn?
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:09.640]   What am I looking at?
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:10.480]   This is the barn.
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.880]   This is the barn from Flashdance.
[00:13:11.880 --> 00:13:13.080]   Yeah, no, you're in the barn.
[00:13:13.080 --> 00:13:13.520]   This is it.
[00:13:13.520 --> 00:13:14.880]   See, look up above.
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:17.160]   It seems to be a high-tech wonderland.
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:18.960]   I have a question about high-tech wonderlands.
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:19.400]   Yes.
[00:13:19.400 --> 00:13:21.560]   What is this?
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:22.720]   That's one note, 20 times.
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:24.240]   And are you a doctor?
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.000]   By the way, for those listening on the podcast
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.280]   later, Nick Biltman has pointed out that Leo Leport has
[00:13:28.280 --> 00:13:31.160]   notes on a clipboard, paper device.
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:32.160]   A clipboard.
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:33.160]   A low power.
[00:13:33.160 --> 00:13:35.040]   And Mr. Bilton, the lab results are in.
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:37.760]   I have some very bad news.
[00:13:37.760 --> 00:13:38.600]   No, I don't know why.
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.480]   But this just is the--
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.400]   I could have pulled this up on the computer.
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:45.000]   Have you ever heard of the iPad?
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:47.600]   Or maybe the touchpad from HP.
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:49.680]   But notice, we make the paper blue.
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:53.200]   By the way, the touchpad is cheaper than that paper.
[00:13:53.200 --> 00:13:54.760]   I will talk about that in just a moment.
[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:55.520]   $99.
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:56.640]   Any of you get one?
[00:13:56.640 --> 00:13:57.480]   No, I was busy.
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:13:58.160]   Did you buy one?
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:59.240]   I was not.
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:00.080]   What do you mean?
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.920]   I was busy using products that sell
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:03.720]   you so.
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:04.280]   Why not?
[00:14:04.280 --> 00:14:05.240]   I have a lot of gadgets.
[00:14:05.240 --> 00:14:05.880]   I don't use it.
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:07.600]   So you don't have to use this paper stuff right here.
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:09.440]   I'm going to look at my touchpad and tell you
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:12.080]   that it was time to take a break and talk about go to meeting
[00:14:12.080 --> 00:14:14.160]   with HD faces.
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:14.960]   Go to meeting.
[00:14:14.960 --> 00:14:16.880]   Of course, we've talked about many times before.
[00:14:16.880 --> 00:14:20.840]   The video conference or the group online conferencing
[00:14:20.840 --> 00:14:21.360]   solution.
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.560]   I just gave it all away.
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:24.680]   I just-- spoiler alert.
[00:14:24.680 --> 00:14:26.600]   It's now got video.
[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:28.000]   And it is so incredible.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:30.560]   We use Go to meeting for all of our meetings
[00:14:30.560 --> 00:14:32.560]   because it's just the easiest way to start a meeting
[00:14:32.560 --> 00:14:36.000]   if you want to share your screen with a client or a customer.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.200]   It's so simple.
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.920]   And now they've got this incredible quality video right
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:41.440]   across the top of the screen.
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:42.760]   It just looks fantastic.
[00:14:42.760 --> 00:14:44.200]   I want you to give it a try.
[00:14:44.200 --> 00:14:45.480]   If you've never used Go to meeting,
[00:14:45.480 --> 00:14:48.480]   there's a great chance to use it for free for 30 days.
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:52.840]   Is it go to meeting.com and click the try at free button.
[00:14:52.840 --> 00:14:53.280]   The promo--
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:55.080]   Go to where, Leo?
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:55.760]   I'm going right now.
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:58.920]   Go to meeting.com.
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:14:59.440]   Look at that.
[00:14:59.440 --> 00:14:59.940]   Look at it.
[00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:00.640]   See, there's the guy.
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:01.960]   He's having a meeting.
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:03.520]   And you can see his face.
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:04.720]   And you can see the screen.
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:06.160]   Now, you can get up to six people in here.
[00:15:06.160 --> 00:15:07.280]   That looks like you, Nick.
[00:15:07.280 --> 00:15:08.840]   And they've got six people in here.
[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:12.720]   And then if you've got a webcam,
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:15.920]   it is the most beautiful crystal clear high-def video.
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:18.120]   They've really done a great job.
[00:15:18.120 --> 00:15:19.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:20.080]   Java.
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:20.960]   Takes about 30 seconds.
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:23.000]   Mac or PC completely cross-platform.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.120]   If you don't-- if you're starting a meeting,
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:26.920]   your client doesn't have to have it pre-installed.
[00:15:26.920 --> 00:15:28.520]   They just click a link, and they're
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:30.000]   in the meeting about 30 seconds later,
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:32.240]   including the video.
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:34.640]   For product reviews, sales presentations, training,
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:37.000]   status meetings, it's just really great.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.680]   If it's like Google Hangouts, steroids,
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:40.600]   plus the screen sharing and everything.

[00:15:49.360 --> 00:15:52.720]   Online meetings made easy and now visual with HD faces

[00:15:55.920 --> 00:15:57.120]   Offer code TWIT.
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:00.720]   Ed Yakobuchi just poked me on Facebook, apparently.
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:01.720]   That didn't raise it.
[00:16:01.720 --> 00:16:03.440]   You know who that is?
[00:16:03.440 --> 00:16:05.120]   He's a guy who started Citrix.
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:09.960]   He was on IBM's OS2 team and was in the trade, the player
[00:16:09.960 --> 00:16:10.880]   trade.
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:13.640]   He went over and worked on NT, and then you remember Microsoft
[00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:15.680]   sent people over to work on OS2.
[00:16:15.680 --> 00:16:18.040]   And when he basically wrote the kernel for NT
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:20.680]   and used that knowledge then to create Citrix.
[00:16:20.680 --> 00:16:23.840]   I want someone in the chat room with more time than I do
[00:16:23.840 --> 00:16:27.720]   to go back over all 315 TWITs and find all your Ed Yakobuchi
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:29.000]   stores.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.280]   They're making only like all Ed Yakobuchi.
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:32.760]   That's a new one.
[00:16:32.760 --> 00:16:34.640]   That's a new one, Ed Yakobuchi poked me.
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:35.280]   That's a new one.
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:36.760]   I could show you on my Facebook page.
[00:16:36.760 --> 00:16:38.400]   We have some breaking news here.
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:39.240]   Oh my god, what happened?
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:41.400]   Skype is buying Group Me.
[00:16:41.400 --> 00:16:41.760]   What?
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:42.520]   Apparently.
[00:16:42.520 --> 00:16:43.720]   Now what is Group Me?
[00:16:43.720 --> 00:16:44.640]   That's like Voluga.
[00:16:44.640 --> 00:16:45.560]   That's one of those--
[00:16:45.560 --> 00:16:47.160]   Ed Yak, Voluga, yeah.
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:47.920]   Group chat.
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:48.400]   That's not--
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.560]   Why would Skype even need that?
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:52.320]   Because they have chat built in.
[00:16:52.320 --> 00:16:55.760]   Well, Group Me is much more of a text messaging from mobile.
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:16:55.960]   Right.
[00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:56.760]   And mobile to mobile.
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:58.640]   That makes your carrier independent.
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:00.440]   And you don't need 3G for it.
[00:17:00.440 --> 00:17:01.640]   It'll use Wi-Fi.
[00:17:01.640 --> 00:17:02.840]   You don't have to use--
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:04.200]   Oh, because it's the SMS.
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:05.040]   It could actually have it.
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.040]   So even--
[00:17:06.040 --> 00:17:06.680]   Not 3G.
[00:17:06.680 --> 00:17:07.760]   SMS, that's what I meant.
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:08.480]   Yeah.
[00:17:08.480 --> 00:17:09.480]   All right, back to regular schedule.
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:10.840]   No, that's a good story.
[00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:12.160]   So we just broke news on it.
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:13.800]   We just saturated market.
[00:17:13.800 --> 00:17:15.000]   It was actually TechCrunch that broke it.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.600]   I just saw it.
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:17.320]   Way to cite it.
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:18.120]   Look at this.
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:18.960]   Of course you have to.
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:19.920]   Mr. Michael Arndt.
[00:17:19.920 --> 00:17:21.720]   We just cite it while showing a blog that never cites anybody.
[00:17:21.720 --> 00:17:24.320]   Oh, he went there.
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:25.320]   He's OK.
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:25.840]   It's OK.
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:26.320]   It's a real home.
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:27.280]   It's a gaming company.
[00:17:27.280 --> 00:17:29.080]   Who did they steal this from?
[00:17:29.080 --> 00:17:30.080]   Who did they steal what from?
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:30.680]   No, the story.
[00:17:30.680 --> 00:17:32.160]   Maybe they did get the story.
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:33.200]   It's all sourced.
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.680]   It's Michael Arrington.
[00:17:34.680 --> 00:17:36.720]   Have you heard of him?
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.000]   He's a small investor in the--
[00:17:38.000 --> 00:17:38.500]   What?
[00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:39.240]   --some area?
[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:40.240]   Once.
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:41.520]   What do you think of that?
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:42.080]   What's that?
[00:17:42.080 --> 00:17:43.400]   Times wouldn't let you invest in companies.
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:43.920]   Absolutely not.
[00:17:43.920 --> 00:17:46.440]   I had to sell my Apple stock before I even became a reporter.
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:47.120]   Just--
[00:17:47.120 --> 00:17:48.040]   And you know what I bought it at?
[00:17:48.040 --> 00:17:48.280]   What?
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:49.000]   $25.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:49.880]   And what did you sell it at?
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:52.200]   I sold it at $75.
[00:17:52.200 --> 00:17:52.600]   Oh.
[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:53.560]   So I made a little bit of money.
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:56.200]   But right now, I would have sold it at $400.
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:17:56.920]   You've been rich enough to--
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:17:57.840]   I have to work in New York.
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:17:58.280]   I have to work in New York.
[00:17:58.280 --> 00:17:59.280]   You could buy the New York.
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.240]   You've been rich enough to actually afford living in San Francisco.
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:04.680]   I actually had the opportunity to be an angel investor
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:08.520]   in a company which I won't name to put $25,000 in.
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:11.600]   And on the recent funding they got,
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:13.520]   it would have netted $3.5 million.
[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:14.640]   But I couldn't do it because--
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:15.720]   And here you are.
[00:18:15.720 --> 00:18:17.400]   --I work at the New York Times.
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:17.840]   But you--
[00:18:17.840 --> 00:18:18.320]   It's heckling.
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:19.160]   But it's a good question.
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:21.440]   So is it right or is it wrong?
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:23.480]   I think it's absolutely right to not do that
[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:25.960]   when Mike Harrington's doing is, I think, appalling.
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:28.560]   Well, right or wrong in what sense.
[00:18:28.560 --> 00:18:30.440]   Well, he says--
[00:18:30.440 --> 00:18:31.240]   This is an old story.
[00:18:31.240 --> 00:18:32.800]   But I think it's a good one to talk about with you guys.
[00:18:32.800 --> 00:18:35.080]   He says, hey, as long as I disclose,
[00:18:35.080 --> 00:18:37.320]   I should be able to invest in the companies I'm covering.
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:38.040]   Yikes.
[00:18:38.040 --> 00:18:38.720]   I disagree.
[00:18:38.720 --> 00:18:39.960]   Yeah, I would disagree.
[00:18:39.960 --> 00:18:42.200]   I disagree since I do something like that
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:45.000]   and don't invest in companies that I write about.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:46.360]   That's just the--
[00:18:46.360 --> 00:18:48.880]   His TechCrunch really is a blog about startups.
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:50.960]   And for him to have money in startups,
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:52.920]   it just seems to me a little bit odd.
[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:55.000]   If only there were a term for that.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.280]   Well, that's a conflict in something or something.
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:59.760]   I mean, do we have to jump ahead to other things?
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.280]   Or do we have to go anywhere?
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:03.520]   We should move on to Ashton Kutcher.
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:04.040]   Bam.
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:06.080]   That's a perfect example of this.
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:08.320]   What are you investing in a movie studio?
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:10.560]   So Mr. Ashton Kutcher, if you guys heard of him,
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:12.240]   he was on this 3 and 1/2 man.
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:13.240]   He's now.
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:14.960]   He's taking-- he's taking--
[00:19:14.960 --> 00:19:16.560]   He's taking what's his name's place?
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:18.000]   Tiger Bud's place.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:19.440]   Tiger-- Charlie Shiger.
[00:19:19.440 --> 00:19:21.440]   Oh, Tiger Bud's place?
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.280]   No, in some ways he is TechCrunch.
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:24.880]   It's close, but very close.
[00:19:24.880 --> 00:19:28.440]   So he's invested in a ton of startups.
[00:19:28.440 --> 00:19:31.720]   And he was invited to be the guest editor for Details
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:35.320]   Magazine for a special section about technology companies.
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:38.000]   And in doing so, he wrote about his favorites.
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:39.920]   There's companies.
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:41.720]   Technology companies and didn't disclose
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:42.480]   that he was an investor.
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:44.000]   He didn't say my favorite investments.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:45.360]   He said my favorite technology company.
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:46.720]   I guess the only thing I'd say about that
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:49.840]   is he's already rich and is not a journalist.
[00:19:49.840 --> 00:19:52.960]   And this was probably just stupidity.
[00:19:52.960 --> 00:19:54.760]   FTC says they're not going to invest in--
[00:19:54.760 --> 00:19:56.720]   Well, the FTC first said that it's
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:59.000]   something that they would investigate.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:19:59.680]   And then they--
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:00.160]   FTC.
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:00.680]   FCC.
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:01.180]   FCC.
[00:20:01.180 --> 00:20:01.680]   OK.
[00:20:01.680 --> 00:20:03.560]   So there's two things that he could have had problems with.
[00:20:03.560 --> 00:20:05.480]   One is the FTC because there's strict rules
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:09.320]   about advertisements versus journalism and also disclosure.
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:12.000]   And then the SEC, because these are multi-billion dollar
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.760]   companies is invested in, if any of them are to go public,
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:16.920]   or if any of them are being traded on the secondary market,
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:18.680]   it's against law.
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:21.280]   And there's an area called the Quiet Period.
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:23.560]   So if he was aware of that, then he could--
[00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:24.080]   So is he going to jail?
[00:20:24.080 --> 00:20:25.280]   I've got to say, though.
[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:27.600]   This is not-- look, he's on the cover of Details,
[00:20:27.600 --> 00:20:28.840]   movie star guy.
[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:29.520]   He's an idiot.
[00:20:29.520 --> 00:20:30.160]   It's a puff--
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:31.920]   I'm sure the article's a puff.
[00:20:31.920 --> 00:20:34.080]   The insanity defense for celebrities.
[00:20:34.080 --> 00:20:35.120]   Yeah, I'm an idiot.
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:38.000]   But the reason I bring it up in relation to Arrington
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:40.560]   is because there are a lot of these situations now
[00:20:40.560 --> 00:20:42.280]   where people have millions of followers on Twitter.
[00:20:42.280 --> 00:20:43.960]   And they're tweeting about things they've invested in.
[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:46.560]   They're a spokesperson for whatever and not disclosing that.
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:48.480]   And it's blurring a lot of these lines.
[00:20:48.480 --> 00:20:50.960]   And it seems like an issue less for him
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:52.120]   than for Details Magazine.
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:53.040]   Didn't fit his name.
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:54.040]   He made it stock.
[00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:54.960]   He made it stock.
[00:20:54.960 --> 00:20:58.800]   He made a ton of money stock pumping on Twitter.
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:00.400]   Hundreds of millions of dollars.
[00:21:00.400 --> 00:21:00.960]   Some of that deals in--
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:02.360]   No investigation.
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:02.880]   What?
[00:21:02.880 --> 00:21:03.640]   Details?
[00:21:03.640 --> 00:21:05.240]   He was asking what Details Magazine actually is.
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:05.920]   I could tell you--
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:07.120]   I could tell you read it judging by the way you've
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:07.800]   dressed today.
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:08.800]   Read and write the description.
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:12.200]   Details Magazine is obviously a magazine that deals in details
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:13.360]   of various sorts.
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.000]   Fashion.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.800]   It's fashion.
[00:21:15.800 --> 00:21:18.840]   So it's not like a journalistic--
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:19.920]   Well, no, that means--
[00:21:19.920 --> 00:21:20.920]   If you're the reader--
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:23.080]   If you're the reader of this magazine--
[00:21:23.080 --> 00:21:23.440]   Sure.
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:25.160]   And you're getting this list--
[00:21:25.160 --> 00:21:26.160]   the assumption is not--
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:27.760]   It's from Ashton Kuster.
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:28.160]   Come on.
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:29.160]   He sells cameras.
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.200]   But even--
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:31.520]   What are we talking about here?
[00:21:31.520 --> 00:21:35.160]   Even that-- the fact that someone isn't necessarily
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:36.760]   a New York Times reporter or something,
[00:21:36.760 --> 00:21:38.600]   like if they're going to recommend a list of things,
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:39.320]   I would like to know--
[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:39.800]   Yeah, I agree.
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:41.000]   --if they're going to get financially
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:42.640]   at that financial interest tied up in it.
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:43.320]   It's just basic.
[00:21:43.320 --> 00:21:44.320]   It doesn't seem like complicated.
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:46.320]   It really is-- would not have been that difficult to say.
[00:21:46.320 --> 00:21:48.720]   In one sentence, I invested in X, Y, and Z.
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:50.040]   And here's why I love this.
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:52.120]   Yeah, it could add to the case.
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:54.400]   But it's a little shady to not do that.
[00:21:54.400 --> 00:21:54.840]   I agree.
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:56.320]   They didn't investigate, so they obviously
[00:21:56.320 --> 00:21:57.880]   felt that he was a--
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:59.160]   It's incestuous is what it is.
[00:21:59.160 --> 00:21:59.920]   I mean, it's--
[00:21:59.920 --> 00:22:00.440]   Yeah.
[00:22:00.440 --> 00:22:03.240]   And I guess that's my point, is that everybody's doing it.
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:04.960]   The real key is that it be disclosed,
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.000]   so you can make your judgment based on that.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:09.160]   I think that that's not completely untrue.
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:11.760]   But I think the other thing is that eventually someone
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:12.800]   is going to get investigated.
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:14.880]   And this I know from people I've spoken to at the FCC
[00:22:14.880 --> 00:22:19.200]   that this is a very blurry line right now.
[00:22:19.200 --> 00:22:21.320]   And somebody's going to do something
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:23.040]   that is going to get enough coverage,
[00:22:23.040 --> 00:22:23.720]   and it'll end up--
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:26.960]   You think it'll be like a financial news type, investment.
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:27.640]   It's going to be me.
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:29.560]   I don't know what it's going to be, but it's going to happen.
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:31.600]   They're going to have to set some rules.
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:32.120]   Guys.
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:34.920]   It really killed Henry Blodgett's career.
[00:22:34.920 --> 00:22:36.640]   It ran from security straining.
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:37.400]   He can't trade.
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:38.040]   Who is--
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:38.600]   Blodgett.
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:39.600]   Henry Blodgett.
[00:22:39.600 --> 00:22:40.960]   Who did get in a lot of trouble.
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:42.960]   He paid a huge fine.
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:43.520]   Yeah.
[00:22:43.520 --> 00:22:46.400]   So is that a strabble established street cred for that guy?
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:46.760]   Or--
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:48.600]   I think it hasn't hurt his career.
[00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:51.200]   I don't know what it actually had to become a journalist.
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:51.680]   Right.
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:52.680]   Shocking.
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:53.560]   Shocking.
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:54.360]   We all end up here.
[00:22:54.360 --> 00:22:55.560]   It's a downward spiral.
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:57.000]   Is this the cough button right here?
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:22:57.360]   Is it--
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.440]   OK, go ahead and press it in cough.
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:01.200]   Anyone hear me?
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:01.760]   I actually did.
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:02.760]   It didn't work.
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:04.440]   I still heard you call it hard to find.
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:06.000]   This technology is broken.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:06.480]   It doesn't take--
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:07.440]   Where is OMG Chad?
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:09.720]   We put a button on there to make you feel better.
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:10.960]   Press the kid in the time.
[00:23:10.960 --> 00:23:13.520]   Any reason that you feel that you need much money in his time.
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:14.440]   Refresh my water.
[00:23:14.440 --> 00:23:15.800]   Can I get another coffee, please?
[00:23:15.800 --> 00:23:16.800]   Yeah.
[00:23:16.800 --> 00:23:18.680]   Another coffee for Mr. Kutcher?
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:21.480]   You know your-- in person, your voice sounds very different.
[00:23:21.480 --> 00:23:23.800]   Did you-- were you the 777 film guy?
[00:23:23.800 --> 00:23:25.160]   No.
[00:23:25.160 --> 00:23:26.680]   Press 1 now.
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:27.680]   It sounds like it, right?
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:28.160]   Hello.
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:29.520]   Welcome to the movie phone.
[00:23:29.520 --> 00:23:31.120]   And welcome to a movie phone.
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.360]   You'd like to see Ashley Kutcher.
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:32.880]   Why?
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:33.600]   Press 1 now.
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.320]   Why am I shouting?
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:37.360]   If you would like to hear what Ashley Kutcher recommends
[00:23:37.360 --> 00:23:38.000]   as far as Stark--
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:39.320]   Press 1 now.
[00:23:39.320 --> 00:23:40.320]   Why is he shouting?
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:41.080]   He's always shouting.
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:43.120]   Because he's enthusiastic about all the great films.
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:44.120]   I love movies.
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:44.720]   He's hitting a American--
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:45.400]   Is that still around?
[00:23:45.400 --> 00:23:46.280]   Is the movie phone around?
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:46.880]   Still no.
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:48.800]   We phone David and Colin's site.
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:49.560]   They have a website.
[00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:50.200]   But no, you can't.
[00:23:50.200 --> 00:23:51.360]   Nobody dials 7777.
[00:23:51.360 --> 00:23:53.320]   I think there's a way to find out about this.
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:54.320]   Are you going to call?
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.080]   Only their way.
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:55.680]   I would do it.
[00:23:55.680 --> 00:23:56.360]   I can call.
[00:23:56.360 --> 00:23:57.920]   It's owned by AOL.
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:59.040]   Everything's on AOL.
[00:23:59.040 --> 00:23:59.960]   You're on AOL.
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:00.960]   Everybody's on a money.
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:01.360]   It's on a money.
[00:24:01.360 --> 00:24:02.960]   It was a minority investor.
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:03.480]   OK.
[00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:04.160]   777 film.
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:05.560]   What's the area code?
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:06.560]   Oh, does it matter?
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:07.280]   I don't think it does.
[00:24:07.280 --> 00:24:08.280]   What area code?
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.440]   I'm going to use Google Voice right now.
[00:24:09.440 --> 00:24:09.960]   We're going to--
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:10.160]   No, no.
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.400]   Women, I'm mind's hooked up to audio.
[00:24:11.400 --> 00:24:11.960]   I can do it.
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:12.880]   So you do it.
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:15.400]   But if I get somebody, what should I do?
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:16.440]   Well, if you want, you'll get the guy.
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:17.880]   We're going to the movies, Leo.
[00:24:17.880 --> 00:24:18.400]   Hi.
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.040]   Let's figure out which show.
[00:24:19.040 --> 00:24:20.840]   And we'll take the whole studio to go see the film.
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:21.640]   That's just the FL, right?
[00:24:21.640 --> 00:24:23.320]   She just blows mine and imitates the guy on the other end
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:23.720]   of the video.
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:24.160]   Hello.
[00:24:24.160 --> 00:24:27.160]   I'm calling for film times.
[00:24:27.160 --> 00:24:29.760]   Press 1 if I'm annoying.
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:33.320]   777-FILM.
[00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:35.120]   That's one of the things I like about Google Voice.
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:36.760]   You could say FL-I-FILM.
[00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:37.480]   She can.
[00:24:37.480 --> 00:24:37.880]   All right.
[00:24:37.880 --> 00:24:38.840]   Call can't complete.
[00:24:38.840 --> 00:24:39.800]   Because it needs an area code.
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:41.280]   Try--
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:42.080]   I'll do it once.
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:42.960]   Does anyone have any suggestions?
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:43.440]   800.
[00:24:43.440 --> 00:24:44.800]   So we're just saying 800, 777-FILM.
[00:24:44.800 --> 00:24:46.040]   I was going to say they don't have 800.
[00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:47.520]   It seems like they should have 800, huh?
[00:24:47.520 --> 00:24:48.040]   All right.
[00:24:48.040 --> 00:24:48.800]   Let me make it up.
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:51.960]   All right, we're going to try again with 800-777-FILM.
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.400]   What a waste of time, Mrs. Bin.
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:54.320]   I'm sorry.
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:55.000]   They've sold it.
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:56.720]   They've called and they've moved over the next time.
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:24:58.240]   They're like, next, all right.
[00:24:58.240 --> 00:25:00.200]   Well, we were going to talk about WebOS, but--
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:01.520]   This is so much more exciting.
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:03.120]   And let's face it, it's still around.
[00:25:03.120 --> 00:25:06.560]   Because if it's still around, you can take your clip forward.
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:09.080]   Booby-boom.
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:12.160]   To use our speed-to-label system, press star 2.
[00:25:12.160 --> 00:25:14.400]   If you know the name of the movie you'd like to see,
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:17.040]   press 1 now to choose from a list of current movies.
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:17.880]   This seems like me.
[00:25:17.880 --> 00:25:18.840]   I'm insulted.
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:19.520]   Find a theater.
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:21.000]   Press 3 now.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.800]   You're thick second reviews for this week.
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:24.080]   New and popular movies.
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:25.280]   Press 4 now.
[00:25:25.280 --> 00:25:27.480]   This is what you find by using movie foam.
[00:25:27.480 --> 00:25:28.480]   Press 5 now.
[00:25:28.480 --> 00:25:30.080]   Because Leo's going to be working here now.
[00:25:30.080 --> 00:25:32.400]   [BEEP]
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:34.760]   Movie foam is a free service that provides you with movie
[00:25:34.760 --> 00:25:37.040]   show time for all theaters and the ability to press--
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:39.200]   What the hell do you need that for?
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:43.120]   That's what happens when AOL buys a company and can't.
[00:25:43.120 --> 00:25:44.760]   Wow.
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:48.240]   Hey, what do you find out when movie times are?
[00:25:48.240 --> 00:25:50.480]   I use technology.
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:52.000]   You use your smartphone.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.440]   I use the internet.
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:56.040]   And for movie times, I use Google.
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:25:57.160]   I use Google.com.
[00:25:57.160 --> 00:26:00.840]   First of all, do people still go to the movies?
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:01.520]   How do I find out?
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:03.040]   I pick up my remote and I say, what's on there?
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:04.480]   What's on there?
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:05.040]   Wow, that's interesting.
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:07.160]   No, actually, when did you guys all go to the movies last?
[00:26:07.160 --> 00:26:08.360]   Actually, a theater.
[00:26:08.360 --> 00:26:09.760]   Like less than two days ago.
[00:26:09.760 --> 00:26:11.240]   It's been my almost video yesterday.
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:11.720]   You're on vacation.
[00:26:11.720 --> 00:26:13.480]   You're on live theater show instead.
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:14.480]   And you're a New Yorker.
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:14.880]   Yeah.
[00:26:14.880 --> 00:26:16.960]   So neither of those matters.
[00:26:16.960 --> 00:26:18.320]   You are a vacation.
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:19.520]   You're on a regular.
[00:26:19.520 --> 00:26:20.160]   You're a human being.
[00:26:20.160 --> 00:26:21.360]   Let's get some real people here.
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:23.040]   When was the last time you went to a movie?
[00:26:23.040 --> 00:26:24.320]   Last week.
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:26.040]   When was the last time you went, Nick?
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:27.080]   Now it's going to get on the bus.
[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:28.040]   You broke up recently.
[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:29.040]   Yeah.
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:31.680]   I went to go see a sappy breakup movie and ride a--
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:32.680]   A rom-com.
[00:26:32.680 --> 00:26:35.240]   This is the most depressing--
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:35.920]   What a hug, Nick.
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:36.920]   Would you hug him?
[00:26:36.920 --> 00:26:38.080]   The next couple of months.
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:38.600]   Come on.
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:40.440]   He's too bony for me.
[00:26:40.440 --> 00:26:41.360]   I don't know what the last--
[00:26:41.360 --> 00:26:43.960]   I wanted to see five of these wars.
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:45.760]   I saw a live theater show instead.
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:46.880]   I figured a movie could be streamed.
[00:26:46.880 --> 00:26:49.040]   When's the last time you went to a play?
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:52.000]   Press 1, if it was touchpad.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.320]   Let's talk about HP.
[00:26:53.320 --> 00:26:55.200]   This is a big story.
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:56.080]   HP--
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:26:57.120]   Wait, wait, wait, wait a minute.
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:59.000]   How was touchpad the big part of the story?
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:26:59.760]   No, no, no.
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:01.680]   OS wasn't selling is canceled.
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:03.040]   And somehow we noticed.
[00:27:03.040 --> 00:27:04.120]   But the other thing--
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:05.400]   The other thing, the fact that they're
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:07.040]   getting out of the PC business, you
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:08.040]   think that's a big story?
[00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:08.760]   I think so.
[00:27:08.760 --> 00:27:10.280]   Are they-- they're the number one PC--
[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:11.320]   They're like there exactly.
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:12.280]   Number one PC.
[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:13.560]   Just like the number one PC.
[00:27:13.560 --> 00:27:15.160]   They're not just-- it is not something like that.
[00:27:15.160 --> 00:27:17.040]   It does raise an issue if the number one
[00:27:17.040 --> 00:27:19.680]   manufacturer PCs in the US can't make any money at this--
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:20.720]   Well, but they are making money.
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:21.680]   So that's not actually fair.
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:22.080]   They are making--
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:23.760]   So why are they getting out of it?
[00:27:23.760 --> 00:27:26.760]   I think they are looking for higher margin businesses.
[00:27:26.760 --> 00:27:28.240]   They're not getting enough money.
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:30.960]   The profit margins are very slim on PCs.
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:32.040]   And have been for a really long time.
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:33.320]   You have to sell a lot of them.
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:33.760]   And they do.
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:34.800]   But it's a lot of work.
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:36.000]   And it's selling to individuals now.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:36.480]   Wasn't the--
[00:27:36.480 --> 00:27:37.480]   Wasn't the stat--
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:38.080]   Wasn't the stat--
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:39.120]   I don't have a good growth area anymore.
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:41.880]   Wasn't the stat that HP had to sell seven PCs to make as much
[00:27:41.880 --> 00:27:43.960]   money as Apple did on every one Macintosh?
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:45.760]   They're the GM of the computer world.
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:46.840]   It's a Saturn.
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:47.320]   Yeah.
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:49.760]   So what they did-- so they're getting out of the PC business.
[00:27:49.760 --> 00:27:51.400]   They put WebOS in the back burner.
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:54.520]   And they bought Autonomy, which is a services company.
[00:27:54.520 --> 00:27:57.640]   Enterprise, on the ride up, Nick and I were looking at this.
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:01.000]   And they keep saying, meaning-based computing,
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:02.440]   NBC, and essentially they--
[00:28:02.440 --> 00:28:05.240]   Do you have a problem with your sleeves riding up?
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:06.080]   No, this is a--
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:07.920]   Are you going to get on your BS back spike and your phone?
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:08.440]   I'm sorry.
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:09.680]   They'll look for each other.
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:10.160]   Hey, wait.
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:10.660]   Hold on.
[00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:11.600]   Of my awesome shares.
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:14.240]   Is there a big issue like that sleeves ride up
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:15.120]   and so this side--
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:15.600]   No, hold on.
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:17.240]   You're going paintballing today, aren't you?
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:21.680]   When you move through the world as fast as I do, man.
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:25.560]   Sometimes your clothes just peel themselves off.
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:27.960]   So I need them tethered to my vibe.
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:30.720]   With actually having people in studio.
[00:28:30.720 --> 00:28:32.320]   I wouldn't have noticed that on Skype.
[00:28:32.320 --> 00:28:33.000]   No, you wouldn't.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.400]   I wouldn't have put my hands right.
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:35.600]   This is a very-- is this hip?
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:36.440]   Is this what the kids are doing?
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:37.320]   This is what I do.
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:38.720]   I don't know what the kids do.
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:40.520]   What can I order one from Amazon right now?
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:42.440]   You can probably order anything from Amazon.
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:45.240]   My sleeves used to ride up until I brought the new--
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:46.040]   Until I met Bart.
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:48.040]   It's the new chem wall.
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:50.640]   Now he hugs me when I'm sad.
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:54.720]   I've just been using double-sided tape like an idiot.
[00:28:54.720 --> 00:28:55.920]   I wish you would have seen that, man.
[00:28:55.920 --> 00:28:58.200]   I have my mittens tied through the string
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:28:59.200]   and through the idea.
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.960]   So you think, well, why do they get out of the PC business
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:03.520]   and how are they going to get out?
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:04.120]   Are they going to sell it?
[00:29:04.120 --> 00:29:04.920]   Are they going to spin it off?
[00:29:04.920 --> 00:29:06.400]   What is going to happen?
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:08.400]   Two products I actually think are kind of interesting,
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:10.200]   computers and mobile devices.
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:12.560]   Let's get rid of that.
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:13.920]   The services that's fun.
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:15.680]   No one has ever heard of for a ton of money.
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:17.400]   And number two software company everyone.
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:19.880]   Yeah, but Bart and they were reading the description of them
[00:29:19.880 --> 00:29:21.880]   on the way up and down with fell asleep driving.
[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:24.440]   Well, so what they promise is essentially
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:26.760]   some kind of business intelligence, like knowledge
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:27.480]   management layer.
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:30.120]   They say we can process any file format,
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:32.040]   know its contents, the apps--
[00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:34.320]   it doesn't matter what app the content comes from.
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:38.120]   So they are trying to draw insight out of all this built-in
[00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:39.240]   unstructured data.
[00:29:39.240 --> 00:29:41.040]   You explained that very well.
[00:29:41.040 --> 00:29:42.120]   This is incredibly boring.
[00:29:42.120 --> 00:29:44.440]   No, no, I was hoping to put you guys to sleep,
[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:46.080]   because I want that MacBook Air.
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:48.120]   So if I just keep talking about autonomous meeting-based
[00:29:48.120 --> 00:29:48.600]   computing--
[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:49.600]   run out the door with the air.
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:50.720]   I just jumped to the portal over there.
[00:29:50.720 --> 00:29:51.400]   Yeah.
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:52.720]   You know where you'll end up.
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:53.560]   You'll follow the--
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:54.880]   I see you just follow the ceiling.
[00:29:54.880 --> 00:29:56.160]   It literally is portal.
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:57.840]   So but is this my question?
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:58.640]   Oh, yeah, isn't that great?
[00:29:58.640 --> 00:29:59.840]   Scoville is not--
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:01.120]   Scoville might be in this room.
[00:30:01.120 --> 00:30:01.800]   Oh, really?
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:02.800]   He's scaring us way too.
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:03.880]   Wouldn't we have known by now?
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:05.440]   Oh, my god, he is in this room.
[00:30:05.440 --> 00:30:07.400]   That's so funny.
[00:30:07.400 --> 00:30:10.600]   I thought I sensed the disturbance in the forest.
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:12.280]   Is that why you-- is that why you ran it?
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:14.160]   Well, there's everyone writing on the chat
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:15.120]   is Scoville in this room.
[00:30:15.120 --> 00:30:16.560]   So I looked it up, and then it says he's
[00:30:16.560 --> 00:30:19.440]   four meters away from me.
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:20.840]   And I didn't know what was going on in that.
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:21.840]   Google's not told you that.
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:22.840]   You're like directions to rubber scoville.
[00:30:22.840 --> 00:30:23.840]   This is actually--
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:26.120]   How are they finding-- is this from check-ins or--
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:28.200]   This was something somebody did for South by South West.
[00:30:28.200 --> 00:30:30.440]   You had to check in on four square.
[00:30:30.440 --> 00:30:30.960]   Possibly.
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:33.800]   We last saw Scoville three meters away from you, 13 minutes
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:35.880]   ago.
[00:30:35.880 --> 00:30:36.720]   That is just creepy.
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:38.600]   It's like the guy from Friday the 13th or something.
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:39.400]   That is just creepy.
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:41.120]   But that is making-- that has--
[00:30:41.120 --> 00:30:42.240]   That's how you know your--
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:43.240]   How you know your--
[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:44.720]   --the European version of the site or something.
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:45.240]   I guess so.
[00:30:45.240 --> 00:30:46.360]   But is that interesting?
[00:30:46.360 --> 00:30:48.040]   Yeah, what's with the meters?
[00:30:48.040 --> 00:30:49.120]   Well, I don't know.
[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:50.720]   But it worked.
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:51.560]   Now I have to check in here.
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:52.840]   No one knows how three meters is.
[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:55.360]   That's the problem.
[00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:57.480]   I just think it's bizarre.
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:31:00.480]   That is making-- Ashton Kutcher doesn't have this.
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:01.920]   Is Ashton Kutcher in this room?
[00:31:01.920 --> 00:31:03.120]   Nobody cares.
[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:04.720]   Your chat room people call me The Flash.
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:05.920]   I'm now Flash Aton Day.
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:07.440]   Flash Aton Day.
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:07.960]   Nice.
[00:31:07.960 --> 00:31:10.120]   I'm Leo Ugal.
[00:31:10.120 --> 00:31:12.080]   HP also killed the touchpad.
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:13.720]   You see now why I led with that?
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:14.240]   I did.
[00:31:14.240 --> 00:31:15.440]   PC thing went nowhere.
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:15.880]   I know.
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:16.720]   I don't know why.
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:18.080]   Well, he gets a huge story.
[00:31:18.080 --> 00:31:20.360]   Are they trying to do what IBM kind of did?
[00:31:20.360 --> 00:31:20.840]   Yes.
[00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:23.160]   It's a high margin enterprise boring--
[00:31:23.160 --> 00:31:23.920]   And the new CEO.
[00:31:23.920 --> 00:31:26.200]   I mean, he was brought in just a couple months
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:28.120]   after the company acquired Palm.
[00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:31.360]   And I think if Mark Heard hadn't had his personal problems--
[00:31:31.360 --> 00:31:33.280]   It would have been a different story by now.
[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:34.040]   But the--
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:35.760]   Leo Pothicker, this is what he does.
[00:31:35.760 --> 00:31:37.320]   Yes, he's like a services guy.
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:38.360]   He's not a hard worker.
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:40.680]   And the idea that he would want to then
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:42.920]   then company to his interests--
[00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:45.000]   --and incredibly boring company just
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:46.240]   got a lot more boring.
[00:31:46.240 --> 00:31:48.240]   But maybe more profitable?
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:48.640]   Well--
[00:31:48.640 --> 00:31:49.360]   That's interesting.
[00:31:49.360 --> 00:31:51.600]   --and do you issue the math on the acquisitions
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:53.080]   and how much it's going to come?
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:54.840]   Yeah, you know, wasn't-- it was only eight years ago
[00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:56.560]   or nine years ago they bought Compaq.
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:58.440]   And that was the big story.
[00:31:58.440 --> 00:31:59.480]   It was kind of a disaster for me.
[00:31:59.480 --> 00:32:00.840]   And it was a hideous disaster.
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:02.880]   Carly, for you reading it's forced out.
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:03.880]   So it was a lot of money.
[00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:04.720]   What was the cost of Compaq?
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:05.080]   Does anyone remember?
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:06.120]   It was a lot of money.
[00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:07.640]   I'm sure Motorola will know.
[00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:10.200]   While you asked Motorola--
[00:32:10.200 --> 00:32:12.960]   MGC had a great post about how HP essentially
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:14.960]   said that Apple had won.
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:17.240]   Well, that is exactly what MG would think.
[00:32:17.240 --> 00:32:18.520]   But at the same time--
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:21.400]   --I don't think this is necessarily a good thing.
[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:21.800]   Because--
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:23.040]   $25 billion for Compaq.
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:23.720]   $25 billion.
[00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:24.220]   Wow.
[00:32:24.220 --> 00:32:26.440]   --twice what Motorola paid for Google.
[00:32:26.440 --> 00:32:28.120]   Oh, they bought a real company.
[00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:30.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:31.280]   So here's the issue, right?
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:34.840]   So before the iPhone 4, there wasn't really much Android
[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:35.640]   out there, right?
[00:32:35.640 --> 00:32:37.720]   So when we had the iPhone 3G--
[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:40.920]   and we got the 3GS, it was really kind of a lame update.
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:41.420]   Right?
[00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:43.580]   And they could have easily gone straight to the 4,
[00:32:43.580 --> 00:32:44.900]   but they didn't because they knew they were still
[00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:45.780]   going to sell X number.
[00:32:45.780 --> 00:32:47.700]   And by the way, they're going to do exactly the same thing.
[00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:48.860]   I don't think they are now.
[00:32:48.860 --> 00:32:50.060]   I think they were planning it out now.
[00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:51.660]   In October, they're not going to go to the 4G.
[00:32:51.660 --> 00:32:53.780]   I think that they may offer a 4GS,
[00:32:53.780 --> 00:32:55.580]   but I think they're going to offer the 5 also.
[00:32:55.580 --> 00:32:56.580]   This is not anything I know.
[00:32:56.580 --> 00:32:57.060]   This is just--
[00:32:57.060 --> 00:32:58.060]   Interesting.
[00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:00.500]   --because they have to--
[00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:02.860]   the way Apple works is they iterate very slowly
[00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:05.100]   when they own a market because they don't have to.
[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:05.620]   They want to--
[00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:08.940]   This is, by the way, what IBM used to do in the '50s and '60s,
[00:33:08.940 --> 00:33:11.140]   they would slow down the releases of their innovation.
[00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:12.820]   Because they make more money that way.
[00:33:12.820 --> 00:33:14.540]   Because when it comes down to, again, they're a hardware
[00:33:14.540 --> 00:33:15.060]   company.
[00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:17.420]   I think there's an interesting moment right now where
[00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:20.780]   it's the second half of 2011.
[00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:24.740]   Nokia's first Windows phones are still a little ways out.
[00:33:24.740 --> 00:33:27.700]   Blackberry is stumbling right now.
[00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:29.420]   Stumbling is one way to put it.
[00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:29.920]   Yeah.
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:30.780]   Charitable way to put it.
[00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:32.420]   Falling down the stairs would be another way.
[00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:33.620]   So I think Apple on their head--
[00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:35.620]   --is an opportunity to grab a lot of--
[00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:38.460]   With a piano behind them.
[00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:39.780]   I love that you're still going.
[00:33:39.780 --> 00:33:40.300]   It's getting worse.
[00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:41.300]   So it's going to be over.
[00:33:41.300 --> 00:33:44.700]   And it comes with oil on the wood.
[00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:46.980]   And the guy like crashing in all that.
[00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:47.660]   But it's just--
[00:33:47.660 --> 00:33:48.500]   And a fire.
[00:33:48.500 --> 00:33:50.220]   What's really happening is--
[00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:52.180]   In a windstorm.
[00:33:52.180 --> 00:33:52.660]   Right.
[00:33:52.660 --> 00:33:54.540]   It's on Mars.
[00:33:54.540 --> 00:33:55.820]   Sorry to take it.
[00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:57.540]   No, but I think it's really important.
[00:33:57.540 --> 00:34:01.900]   Because what's happening is that Apple is now in the place
[00:34:01.900 --> 00:34:04.260]   with the iPad that they were with the iPhone four years ago
[00:34:04.260 --> 00:34:04.820]   and it launched.
[00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:07.100]   And they will iterate slowly because they don't
[00:34:07.100 --> 00:34:08.900]   have to worry about getting--
[00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:09.900]   There's literally a whole--
[00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:10.900]   Right.
[00:34:10.900 --> 00:34:12.860]   Like an iPad 3 could have come out this year if some competition
[00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:13.980]   had shown up, but it did not.
[00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:14.700]   So why bother?
[00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:15.180]   Yeah.
[00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:19.500]   And so maybe the iPad 3 will have retina display
[00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:21.220]   and maybe the iPad 4 will have--
[00:34:21.220 --> 00:34:22.820]   By the way, I think you're absolutely correct.
[00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:23.460]   --in there and so on.
[00:34:23.460 --> 00:34:25.780]   But I think that if there were a competitor in that place
[00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:27.700]   that we would see that happen much really--
[00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:28.740]   And we've seen it happen.
[00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:30.900]   Apple's product cycle has completely changed.
[00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:34.300]   Well, they don't sell a new phone when they normally do.
[00:34:34.300 --> 00:34:37.740]   And then they sell 20 million of the old phone in the most
[00:34:37.740 --> 00:34:38.260]   recent one.
[00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:41.140]   And why bother iterating this thing once you're
[00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:42.260]   searching out to 18 months?
[00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:46.300]   And I think in many ways that's the secret of their success,
[00:34:46.300 --> 00:34:47.860]   is that they can milk this.
[00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:49.700]   That they're responsive to the Apple market.
[00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:52.580]   And I think that one of the negatives on Android,
[00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:53.860]   the thing that scares real people,
[00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:56.940]   is so much iteration so fast, so much new hardware.
[00:34:56.940 --> 00:34:58.780]   And they say, well, God, I didn't know what to choose.
[00:34:58.780 --> 00:34:59.340]   Not chaotic.
[00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:00.300]   Apple is not a gadget.
[00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:00.820]   Apple is a gadget.
[00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:01.820]   What's device?
[00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:03.540]   But do you think it's just your snap?
[00:35:03.540 --> 00:35:04.740]   They were racing to get ahead.
[00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:06.020]   I mean, do you think that will slow down?
[00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:07.140]   Android has to slow down.
[00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:09.620]   No, it's inherent in the way in the Android model,
[00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:12.300]   because Android is free and open source,
[00:35:12.300 --> 00:35:14.380]   so anybody can make an Android handset.
[00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:16.140]   No one can really control that.
[00:35:16.140 --> 00:35:18.220]   I mean, Google, I guess, could exert some control
[00:35:18.220 --> 00:35:19.740]   since you need the Google Apps.
[00:35:19.740 --> 00:35:21.980]   I guess at some point, Google could say to manufacturers,
[00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:22.980]   no stop.
[00:35:22.980 --> 00:35:24.140]   But I can't see that happening.
[00:35:24.140 --> 00:35:26.140]   It's really not the way that's built.
[00:35:26.140 --> 00:35:27.420]   I think we also have to keep in mind
[00:35:27.420 --> 00:35:29.020]   that the average person buys a phone
[00:35:29.020 --> 00:35:30.860]   because they walk into a store--
[00:35:30.860 --> 00:35:31.420]   Every two years.
[00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:32.420]   Every few years.
[00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:33.060]   Every couple of years.
[00:35:33.060 --> 00:35:34.300]   And they just buy whatever's new.
[00:35:34.300 --> 00:35:39.180]   They're not paying attention to whether a new version of this
[00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:40.940]   phone might come out in three months or six months.
[00:35:40.940 --> 00:35:42.460]   But in the Android universe, you go in
[00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:44.060]   and there's four Android phones.
[00:35:44.060 --> 00:35:46.220]   And one just came out, another one's soon.
[00:35:46.220 --> 00:35:47.780]   I don't know if it's that clear when you're--
[00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:48.780]   I think for the average person--
[00:35:48.780 --> 00:35:49.700]   They just say, I'm going to take--
[00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:51.300]   They're not paying close enough attention to this phone.
[00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:52.540]   They buy whatever the best phone is that day.
[00:35:52.540 --> 00:35:54.020]   We care a lot, but they're just going to buy whatever--
[00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:54.860]   Yeah, what do you got?
[00:35:54.860 --> 00:35:56.420]   And it literally changes every week now.
[00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:57.420]   You know, for them.
[00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:00.220]   Then why isn't Windows Phone, for instance, doing better?
[00:36:00.220 --> 00:36:01.420]   Well, there's a lot of that available.
[00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:02.100]   Can you actually buy it?
[00:36:02.100 --> 00:36:03.420]   There's a lot of things going on there.
[00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:04.060]   You can't just walk--
[00:36:04.060 --> 00:36:05.540]   Can't you walk into the store saying,
[00:36:05.540 --> 00:36:06.500]   I want a Windows Phone?
[00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:08.580]   Yeah, but then they try to talk you out of it.
[00:36:08.580 --> 00:36:10.340]   Yeah, I think the carriers are actually doing--
[00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:11.260]   are not pushing it.
[00:36:11.260 --> 00:36:12.420]   I think that's actually the biggest thing
[00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:13.420]   hurting right now.
[00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:13.940]   I think that is a big part of it.
[00:36:13.940 --> 00:36:15.700]   So that's really the single most important thing
[00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:17.940]   is to get the carriers to push your phone.
[00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:19.700]   In the US, that's how most phones get sold,
[00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:21.780]   is because you walk into a store and somebody--
[00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:22.140]   Yeah.
[00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:23.700]   And you ask the guy, the counter,
[00:36:23.700 --> 00:36:25.220]   I need a new phone, and he says, here.
[00:36:25.220 --> 00:36:27.740]   With the exception of AT&T, none of the other carriers
[00:36:27.740 --> 00:36:30.780]   in the US have more than a phone, a single Windows Phone.
[00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:33.700]   So you might have an iPhone, you will have one Windows Phone,
[00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:35.660]   and then you'll have seven Android phones.
[00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:36.500]   So that's the choice.
[00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:39.980]   But the real truth is nobody got fired for selling iPhone.
[00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:44.820]   So if you have Verizon or AT&T, that's nine times out of 10,
[00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:46.660]   that's the phone the guy's going to push across the counter,
[00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:47.140]   right?
[00:36:47.140 --> 00:36:47.660]   Well--
[00:36:47.660 --> 00:36:49.820]   He's not going to say-- I mean, I'm tempted to say,
[00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:51.620]   well, you might want to look at it at Android,
[00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:53.260]   but he's not, because that's too risky.
[00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:54.420]   Push the iPhone across the table.
[00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:56.020]   Well, but push the iPhone across the table.
[00:36:56.020 --> 00:36:57.780]   And then what happens is you say, well,
[00:36:57.780 --> 00:36:59.900]   I don't want to spend $200 and they're like, well,
[00:36:59.900 --> 00:37:01.180]   and then you can try the Android phone.
[00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:01.980]   It's 50 bucks.
[00:37:01.980 --> 00:37:02.500]   Right.
[00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:04.460]   And they're not going to do the conversation.
[00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:05.660]   Yeah, pretty much.
[00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:06.780]   And they'll say in the same way.
[00:37:06.780 --> 00:37:08.380]   Just use the Microsoft can.
[00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:10.380]   And you can get the can of the green sheet.
[00:37:10.380 --> 00:37:11.220]   You can have apps.
[00:37:11.220 --> 00:37:13.740]   You have all these different things and so on.
[00:37:13.740 --> 00:37:15.380]   But I think that--
[00:37:15.380 --> 00:37:17.420]   I think the next version of the Windows Phone
[00:37:17.420 --> 00:37:19.020]   is actually going to be--
[00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:20.620]   I mean, I think it's beautiful, to be quite honest.
[00:37:20.620 --> 00:37:22.260]   The design of it is gorgeous.
[00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:23.380]   It's just they don't have the apps.
[00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:24.060]   They don't have--
[00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:24.540]   No, you didn't have it.
[00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:26.500]   Did somebody just applaud in the back of the room?
[00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:27.060]   It was scumbled.
[00:37:27.060 --> 00:37:27.820]   I thought they fell down.
[00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:29.380]   I was knocking my knees together.
[00:37:29.380 --> 00:37:30.860]   I mean, I think actually, like--
[00:37:30.860 --> 00:37:33.780]   If you look at all the stuff that's gone on this week,
[00:37:33.780 --> 00:37:35.820]   I mean, if you think about it, a couple of years ago,
[00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:38.580]   we were all talking about, well, there's way too many OSs
[00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:39.860]   out there in the mobile space.
[00:37:39.860 --> 00:37:41.460]   There's going to be a shakeout.
[00:37:41.460 --> 00:37:42.580]   This week was the shakeout.
[00:37:42.580 --> 00:37:42.780]   Yeah.
[00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:43.540]   Right.
[00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:44.020]   Yeah.
[00:37:44.020 --> 00:37:44.740]   Things are getting--
[00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:46.100]   It's probably going to be a little more shaking.
[00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:47.420]   We're going to see a little more shaking out.
[00:37:47.420 --> 00:37:51.580]   But I think that if Microsoft is smart and aggressive,
[00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:53.180]   and they're definitely going to be aggressive,
[00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:54.460]   whether or not they're smart about it
[00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:55.300]   is always up for debate.
[00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:58.660]   But this is a big opportunity for them
[00:37:58.660 --> 00:38:00.740]   to really push Windows Phone now.
[00:38:00.740 --> 00:38:01.240]   Yeah.
[00:38:01.240 --> 00:38:03.260]   The Nokia thing is a huge win for them.
[00:38:03.260 --> 00:38:04.420]   I don't even think they need to necessarily
[00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:06.980]   to buy Nokia to get the kind of default of integration
[00:38:06.980 --> 00:38:07.900]   they want.
[00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:09.140]   But this is their moment.
[00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:11.060]   I mean, we might look back a couple years ago,
[00:38:11.060 --> 00:38:13.860]   a couple years from now and say, well, this is when they
[00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:14.420]   turned it around.
[00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:16.060]   Well, like the PC market in the early '80s,
[00:38:16.060 --> 00:38:18.140]   there were all those players that don't exist anymore.
[00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:20.420]   Commodore, and Atari, and TI, and all the people.
[00:38:20.420 --> 00:38:21.860]   Although you can't buy the Commodore.
[00:38:21.860 --> 00:38:24.380]   So if you have a Packard Bell in Paris--
[00:38:24.380 --> 00:38:27.540]   Really interesting article on the next web,
[00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:30.780]   claiming an inside look at the web OS story.
[00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:35.420]   And they're saying that really wasn't
[00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:38.100]   that HP was going to kill web OS.
[00:38:38.100 --> 00:38:40.100]   That's a misunderstanding because HP handled
[00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:41.300]   the announcement poorly.
[00:38:41.300 --> 00:38:43.460]   What HP really intended to say is we're not
[00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:45.460]   going to make web OS hardware.
[00:38:45.460 --> 00:38:47.700]   We're going to license it.
[00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:48.820]   And then our hard--
[00:38:48.820 --> 00:38:50.820]   Because when you just constructed that sense,
[00:38:50.820 --> 00:38:53.140]   you said it way more clearly than they did.
[00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:55.020]   Apparently HP did some writers.
[00:38:55.020 --> 00:38:56.140]   They were prepared for this.
[00:38:56.140 --> 00:38:56.860]   Yeah.
[00:38:56.860 --> 00:38:58.580]   Well, and that's actually kind of the--
[00:38:58.580 --> 00:39:00.540]   HP's 2000 WordPress release didn't get to the run.
[00:39:00.540 --> 00:39:03.060]   But what man would want it now?
[00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:05.380]   Well, apparently this man over here, Peter Rojas,
[00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:06.380]   no one has far as to--
[00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:07.340]   For $99.
[00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:08.860]   I mean, I'll buy a lot of things for $100.
[00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:10.260]   But you know what?
[00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:12.780]   The people-- it was said that there
[00:39:12.780 --> 00:39:16.020]   were about a quarter of a million in stock or in word houses.
[00:39:16.020 --> 00:39:17.300]   That's the best buy.
[00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:20.380]   And they got sold out, yes or no.
[00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:22.540]   Why not should they sign up to $250,000?
[00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:22.860]   I think it's--
[00:39:22.860 --> 00:39:23.420]   Well, where'd they go?
[00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:24.540]   Because you can't get one now.
[00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:26.380]   Well, they're going to probably end up in channels
[00:39:26.380 --> 00:39:26.880]   slowly.
[00:39:26.880 --> 00:39:27.380]   But I think--
[00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:28.980]   It'll be on Woot on Monday.
[00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:30.460]   I mean, the thing is, if you're best buy,
[00:39:30.460 --> 00:39:32.820]   you wouldn't want to be selling $99 touchpads
[00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:33.460]   for the next few weeks.
[00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:34.340]   There's no margin.
[00:39:34.340 --> 00:39:34.860]   Yeah.
[00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:35.500]   Not even the margin.
[00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:36.500]   I mean, let's say that HP gets--
[00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:37.460]   It kills the other days.
[00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:39.060]   It's going to kill the sales of your other tablets
[00:39:39.060 --> 00:39:39.740]   where you do make money.
[00:39:39.740 --> 00:39:41.940]   Oh, and by the way, at Best Buy, which just completely
[00:39:41.940 --> 00:39:43.500]   reorganize their retail operations
[00:39:43.500 --> 00:39:46.620]   to have a huge tablet section and relegate the PCs
[00:39:46.620 --> 00:39:49.180]   off to some side thing next to the CDs or whatever.
[00:39:49.180 --> 00:39:51.900]   And so here's their kind of premier tablet for the $99.
[00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:52.420]   $99.
[00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:53.460]   And it's not good news.
[00:39:53.460 --> 00:39:53.980]   Gone.
[00:39:53.980 --> 00:39:54.480]   Yeah.
[00:39:54.480 --> 00:39:56.800]   But this also, if it sold out at $99,
[00:39:56.800 --> 00:40:00.600]   it was the biggest complaint with HP from analysts--
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:01.400]   Nobody wanted to--
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:02.840]   Was it nobody wanted to pay the same price
[00:40:02.840 --> 00:40:05.840]   that they would for an iPad?
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:06.840]   That's the real issue.
[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:09.400]   If you compare anything to the iPad,
[00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:10.840]   there has to be a selling point.
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:12.360]   And it's not going to be on features.
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:14.160]   It's not going to be on applications.
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:15.240]   It can only be on products.
[00:40:15.240 --> 00:40:17.440]   It can't be something that looks just like an iPad,
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:18.600]   but it's not an iPad.
[00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:21.320]   Well, that's where the Amazon Kindle has been incredibly
[00:40:21.320 --> 00:40:22.240]   successful, rather than--
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:23.520]   Except for it a little bit.
[00:40:23.520 --> 00:40:26.320]   That's where the Amazon Kindle has been incredibly successful,
[00:40:26.320 --> 00:40:30.040]   rather than try to sell it for what it was before, which
[00:40:30.040 --> 00:40:31.040]   is a several hundred dollars.
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:32.760]   Now you can get it for $100.
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:33.260]   Right.
[00:40:33.260 --> 00:40:34.600]   And it tries to do a thing.
[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:35.100]   Yeah.
[00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:35.600]   A thing.
[00:40:35.600 --> 00:40:37.160]   Well, just to tell you very well.
[00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:39.840]   And when they launched the color tablet at the end of the year,
[00:40:39.840 --> 00:40:41.160]   I think that they're going to really--
[00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:41.640]   Well, I think they're going to--
[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:44.200]   I wonder, do you think Amazon looks at this web OS thing
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:46.600]   and says, oh, good or says, oh, dear?
[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:47.400]   I think it's no good.
[00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:47.880]   OK, so--
[00:40:47.880 --> 00:40:49.160]   Because they were already going to be cheap.
[00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:51.480]   I think people are saying, oh, now they know how to price it.
[00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:52.480]   I think they already knew how to price it.
[00:40:52.480 --> 00:40:53.280]   Yeah, they already knew how to price it.
[00:40:53.280 --> 00:40:53.780]   Yeah.
[00:40:53.780 --> 00:40:56.440]   So Ryan and I were talking about these yesterday.
[00:40:56.440 --> 00:40:59.480]   Right now, everyone's fallen into the trap of letting
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:02.640]   Apple define the tablet market as being the iPad and something
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:03.880]   that competes with the iPad.
[00:41:03.880 --> 00:41:05.600]   And just like Nick was saying, you actually
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:08.320]   look at it at the tablet market as, OK, there's the iPad.
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:12.320]   But then I'm going to have my tablet device have some other spin
[00:41:12.320 --> 00:41:14.520]   on it that is not necessarily competing directly
[00:41:14.520 --> 00:41:15.080]   with the iPad.
[00:41:15.080 --> 00:41:17.120]   But maybe it's a single purpose device like a Kindle.
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:18.920]   Or maybe it's like-- I mean, if you think about the color
[00:41:18.920 --> 00:41:21.920]   as a tablet, it's a hugely successful device.
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:22.880]   I don't know how well it's sold.
[00:41:22.880 --> 00:41:23.760]   I mean, I know it sold really well.
[00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:25.720]   I don't know if it sold as many as the iPad.
[00:41:25.720 --> 00:41:26.760]   But I know it sold a lot.
[00:41:26.760 --> 00:41:29.800]   So put yourself in a different category.
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:31.840]   Like a hover pad.
[00:41:31.840 --> 00:41:32.680]   Making cheaper.
[00:41:32.680 --> 00:41:35.680]   If you focused on letting people float on top of it,
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:36.680]   and that was your thing.
[00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:38.400]   And maybe you could play movies if you wanted to.
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:41.680]   The touchpad we probably make a nice welcome mat.
[00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:42.560]   You know, because--
[00:41:42.560 --> 00:41:45.320]   But what's interesting is you may or does make sense
[00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:48.320]   as a point of focus, what are the other things
[00:41:48.320 --> 00:41:50.720]   that you would focus on to differentiate yourself
[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:51.200]   from the iPad?
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:54.440]   I mean, I think you look at the ACIS transformer, which
[00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:56.600]   is about not just being a tablet, but being something that
[00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:58.360]   has really easy to dock into a keyboard.
[00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:00.120]   That's a point of differentiation.
[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:02.600]   I think Windows 8 has an opportunity
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:05.440]   with the fact that it's going to have a touch-based interface.
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:08.720]   And I think if they do it right and make it so that you can live
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:10.880]   in the tablet experience, the fact
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:12.840]   that you'll be able to have access to all the Windows
[00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:14.440]   applications and the backwards compatibility.
[00:42:14.440 --> 00:42:14.960]   It's a PC.
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:15.640]   Yeah, that might be--
[00:42:15.640 --> 00:42:16.640]   I think that actually is a slightly point.
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:17.480]   That might be a point of differentiation.
[00:42:17.480 --> 00:42:18.960]   And I think--
[00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:21.880]   But ultimately, it's not for us to figure out stuff out.
[00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:23.000]   It's for the people who are trying
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:24.120]   to get people to buy something.
[00:42:24.120 --> 00:42:25.200]   I think you can't figure it out.
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:26.440]   You shouldn't be in the business.
[00:42:26.440 --> 00:42:28.360]   And yet, that's what all those devices pretty much were.
[00:42:28.360 --> 00:42:31.000]   Things that were like the iPad, but not the iPad.
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.600]   I think that there's an opportunity--
[00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:34.840]   There's a massive opportunity in creating tablets
[00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:36.600]   that are used in the workplace.
[00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:37.520]   The iPad does not--
[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:38.600]   So corporate friendly tablets.
[00:42:38.600 --> 00:42:39.160]   --that's very difficult.
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:40.160]   --for a particular application.
[00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:40.720]   So medical application.
[00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:42.480]   I think there's also--
[00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:44.400]   What the iPad does really well is entertainment.
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:46.920]   But I think that what Amazon could do with their device
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:48.760]   is really simplify that.
[00:42:48.760 --> 00:42:50.240]   So it's content.
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:51.560]   It's not just gaming and things like that.
[00:42:51.560 --> 00:42:54.400]   But it's Amazon videos, Amazon Music, Amazon Books,
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:56.240]   Amazon magazines.
[00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:58.640]   And make a device that costs nothing.
[00:42:58.640 --> 00:43:00.000]   That people--
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.760]   Because you're wondering why Amazon is still charging
[00:43:02.760 --> 00:43:03.920]   for the Kindle.
[00:43:03.920 --> 00:43:05.280]   It seems like it could be almost--
[00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:07.760]   It's like this kind of ad-based--
[00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:08.280]   Exactly.
[00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:09.440]   I bought that one.
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:11.080]   The ads are not obtrusive.
[00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:12.560]   And it's such a beautiful device.
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:14.360]   They've really come a long way, baby.
[00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:16.160]   Purpose build for what it does.
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:18.720]   No, I think their tablet's going to be a big deal.
[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:20.040]   It's got to be coming.
[00:43:20.040 --> 00:43:20.520]   Soon, can--
[00:43:20.520 --> 00:43:21.480]   --tabblazon.
[00:43:21.480 --> 00:43:23.000]   --so what did you say?
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:23.720]   Tabblazon.
[00:43:23.720 --> 00:43:24.440]   Tabblazon?
[00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:25.320]   Pretty obvious.
[00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:26.280]   Motor Riggle.
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:26.800]   There you go.
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:27.760]   Well, if they use--
[00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:28.280]   Up top.
[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:28.640]   --up top.
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:29.320]   I'll leave me hanging.
[00:43:29.320 --> 00:43:30.120]   I'm right here, guys.
[00:43:30.120 --> 00:43:31.560]   The other thing that I think that is--
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:33.720]   I've got an imprint on this.
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:34.360]   I'm straightening.
[00:43:34.360 --> 00:43:38.720]   It makes me stronger because you have to work out to have it.
[00:43:38.720 --> 00:43:40.920]   The other thing with the Amazon tablet
[00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:45.160]   is when they purchase Touchco, the company out in New York
[00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:46.000]   for the Touch interface.
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.320]   Touchco uses these resistant technologies
[00:43:49.320 --> 00:43:50.400]   where you can actually--
[00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:53.080]   it can detect a hand so you can use a pen.
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:54.360]   Or it can detect your finger.
[00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:55.000]   So you can use both?
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:55.520]   So you can use both.
[00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:57.080]   And that is what vertical markets want.
[00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:57.640]   Exactly.
[00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:58.140]   Yeah.
[00:43:58.140 --> 00:43:59.160]   That's what a doctor wants.
[00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:00.240]   Especially in the medical fields.
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:00.740]   Kids.
[00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:01.240]   Kids.
[00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:04.080]   I mean, Apple's really going after the rounds.
[00:44:04.080 --> 00:44:06.560]   So you give credence to the idea that HP isn't killing
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:07.640]   the hardware--
[00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:09.080]   Or isn't killing software.
[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:11.400]   They're killing the hardware and that they may license
[00:44:11.400 --> 00:44:12.080]   web OS.
[00:44:12.080 --> 00:44:13.800]   And you may have been the smartest guy ever
[00:44:13.800 --> 00:44:15.960]   because you may have actually bought a $99 tablet
[00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:16.960]   with some future.
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:17.960]   I don't think so.
[00:44:17.960 --> 00:44:18.460]   I doubt it.
[00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:19.440]   No, that doesn't sound quite the same.
[00:44:19.440 --> 00:44:21.440]   I'm pretty smart, but maybe not that's bad.
[00:44:21.440 --> 00:44:23.560]   But they even left open the possibility
[00:44:23.560 --> 00:44:25.360]   that they would not sell their PC business.
[00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:26.200]   What are they going to do?
[00:44:26.200 --> 00:44:27.520]   Are they going to spin it out?
[00:44:27.520 --> 00:44:28.080]   So who knows?
[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:28.880]   Shut it down.
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:30.680]   Or would they keep the business part and sell
[00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:32.120]   the consumer part?
[00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:34.160]   Who would buy a PC from these people at this point?
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:34.800]   At this point.
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:35.960]   There's no credibility.
[00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:36.720]   It's crazy.
[00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:40.080]   And then who would want to buy web OS from them
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:41.360]   to put it on their own devices?
[00:44:41.360 --> 00:44:44.360]   The only thing about it is even if they decide not
[00:44:44.360 --> 00:44:47.160]   to sell devices, developing and maintaining web OS
[00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:48.240]   is very expensive.
[00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:52.000]   Because Google, a lot of money to keep Android innovating
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.040]   and rolling out new features and changing the OS.
[00:44:55.040 --> 00:44:55.560]   $7.
[00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:57.560]   $12.
[00:44:57.560 --> 00:44:59.000]   $12.5 billion.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:00.800]   It's a really significant investment.
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:01.560]   It's interesting.
[00:45:01.560 --> 00:45:02.640]   Really interesting.
[00:45:02.640 --> 00:45:06.160]   I just don't see HP doing that.
[00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:06.640]   Maybe--
[00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:07.640]   Not if there are services.
[00:45:07.640 --> 00:45:11.880]   They do not have the makeup to be a consumer company.
[00:45:11.880 --> 00:45:12.800]   They just don't.
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:13.320]   Yeah.
[00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:15.040]   They just don't-- I don't-- honestly, they don't have
[00:45:15.040 --> 00:45:17.440]   the engineering talent to make a great mobile OS.
[00:45:17.440 --> 00:45:19.880]   Nobody goes into a best buy and thinks, I'm going to buy an HP.
[00:45:19.880 --> 00:45:21.040]   Somebody thinks they have talent.
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:23.640]   Microsoft is going after the Web OS development team.
[00:45:23.640 --> 00:45:25.040]   Well, yes.
[00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:27.000]   Developers have developed the development team.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:27.880]   Developers.
[00:45:27.880 --> 00:45:28.760]   Yeah, that's different.
[00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:29.080]   Yeah.
[00:45:29.080 --> 00:45:30.280]   That's different.
[00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:31.480]   So I have a question for you, Peter.
[00:45:31.480 --> 00:45:33.600]   So one of the things that I started to seek--
[00:45:33.600 --> 00:45:35.720]   and I don't know if you guys discussed this last week,
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:40.840]   but an example is the Amazon web interface
[00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:43.400]   for the iPad for Kindle.
[00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:44.160]   What is it called again?
[00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:44.640]   Cloud leader.
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:45.160]   Cloud leader.
[00:45:45.160 --> 00:45:46.160]   Cloud leader.
[00:45:46.160 --> 00:45:49.840]   So the more of those that exist, the more you don't necessarily
[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:53.040]   need to buy an iPad because these apps exist.
[00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:54.480]   And the cloud--
[00:45:54.480 --> 00:45:55.640]   Anything they can do with your phone.
[00:45:55.640 --> 00:45:56.440]   If you can hear it.
[00:45:56.440 --> 00:46:00.320]   So how can Apple usurp this from happening?
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:01.240]   Like, can they?
[00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:02.000]   I'm not sure they can--
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:02.920]   They can stop it.
[00:46:02.920 --> 00:46:06.120]   They, in a way, got screwed by their own initial rhetoric
[00:46:06.120 --> 00:46:08.320]   for the iPhone, which is we're not going to make apps.
[00:46:08.320 --> 00:46:10.040]   You just use web apps.
[00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:12.480]   And now they wish that people wouldn't
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:15.240]   make web apps because apps are where they make all their money,
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:16.320]   especially in app purchases.
[00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:18.960]   I think the trick is they have to keep improving the hardware
[00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:21.680]   and having things that apps can do,
[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:24.440]   that web-based apps can't do because there's
[00:46:24.440 --> 00:46:26.320]   some hooks into the hardware in some way.
[00:46:26.320 --> 00:46:28.240]   But I think the more of these things that exist,
[00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:31.200]   the more of these HTML5 web apps that exist,
[00:46:31.200 --> 00:46:33.960]   the less there is the reason to go and purchase the iPad.
[00:46:33.960 --> 00:46:34.480]   Especially, yeah.
[00:46:34.480 --> 00:46:35.360]   As these devices get better.
[00:46:35.360 --> 00:46:35.840]   That's right.
[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:36.360]   Absolutely.
[00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:38.720]   And I'm going to say if I'm the New York Times,
[00:46:38.720 --> 00:46:41.760]   if I am on a publication, I'm going to do an HTML5.
[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:43.480]   That's what the Onion iPad app is.
[00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:46.400]   HTML5 with a thin Objective-C wrapper on it.
[00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:47.200]   And it scales.
[00:46:47.200 --> 00:46:49.440]   It works on a desktop computer.
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:50.960]   It's working on an Android tablet.
[00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:53.360]   The install scenario here is so much better than even the--
[00:46:53.360 --> 00:46:55.440]   I just installed it as we were talking,
[00:46:55.440 --> 00:46:57.440]   because I hadn't turned to put it on this machine.
[00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:58.200]   And there it is.
[00:46:58.200 --> 00:46:58.800]   And it looks--
[00:46:58.800 --> 00:46:59.600]   It's just there.
[00:46:59.600 --> 00:47:00.840]   It looks exactly the same.
[00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:01.400]   I can download it.
[00:47:01.400 --> 00:47:03.360]   I use this on the way here on the plane
[00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:05.400]   to read a book offline on the laptop,
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:06.720]   just to see how that worked.
[00:47:06.720 --> 00:47:07.240]   And how was it?
[00:47:07.240 --> 00:47:07.840]   It was great.
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:08.320]   Yeah.
[00:47:08.320 --> 00:47:11.320]   What's really cool is you don't have to download the book first.
[00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:11.960]   You just click it.
[00:47:11.960 --> 00:47:12.360]   You don't have to download it.
[00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:12.720]   You don't have to download it.
[00:47:12.720 --> 00:47:13.960]   But you can't.
[00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:16.200]   And then it will cache the page and eventually
[00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:17.040]   cache the whole book.
[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:18.920]   And on the iPad, it has up to 50 megabytes.
[00:47:18.920 --> 00:47:20.200]   That's the negative, by the way.
[00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:23.600]   Apple has constrained in any app to have no more than 50 megabytes.
[00:47:23.600 --> 00:47:24.880]   All offline storage.
[00:47:24.880 --> 00:47:25.320]   Yeah.
[00:47:25.320 --> 00:47:25.960]   That might be--
[00:47:25.960 --> 00:47:26.800]   For books, it's fine.
[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:27.760]   Yeah.
[00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:29.680]   Yeah, I guess 50 meg's is quite a few books.
[00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:30.680]   That's 50 books.
[00:47:30.680 --> 00:47:32.840]   What's your crazy fonts?
[00:47:32.840 --> 00:47:35.280]   Let's all use crazy fonts.
[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:37.320]   I bet Barrett turned to his book on your crazy fonts.
[00:47:37.320 --> 00:47:38.840]   Is it a Von Tsurner?
[00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:41.120]   Yeah, you know, Java, Beginners Guy.
[00:47:41.120 --> 00:47:42.120]   Good.
[00:47:42.120 --> 00:47:42.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:47:42.640 --> 00:47:43.320]   This is a good one.
[00:47:43.320 --> 00:47:46.000]   William F. Buckley, cancel your own goddamn subscription.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   That's a classic.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:49.720]   I know exactly what you want.
[00:47:49.720 --> 00:47:50.760]   Heroes?
[00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:51.800]   Sex time and power.
[00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:52.320]   You ever read that?
[00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:55.320]   I love that we've broken into groups now.
[00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:57.320]   Paul and I are having a whole situation screwing.
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:47:58.640]   You guys, I'm killing them.
[00:47:58.640 --> 00:48:00.200]   What do you guys know we're here on Google+?
[00:48:00.200 --> 00:48:01.120]   Hanging out.
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:05.600]   The guys, internet guys, from my friends go.
[00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:07.600]   I think, yeah, I think Barrett today started to hang out.
[00:48:07.600 --> 00:48:08.600]   Yeah.
[00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:09.600]   What's the--
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:10.600]   We should hang out with each other.
[00:48:10.600 --> 00:48:11.600]   We should hang out with each other.
[00:48:11.600 --> 00:48:13.200]   We're going to have a topic there in your paper.
[00:48:13.200 --> 00:48:13.700]   There is.
[00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:14.440]   I'm going to take a break and we're
[00:48:14.440 --> 00:48:15.280]   going to talk about Squarespace.
[00:48:15.280 --> 00:48:16.040]   And we will come back.
[00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:17.480]   And I'm sure there'll be some other news story
[00:48:17.480 --> 00:48:20.640]   we could talk about now that we've done the two biggies.
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:22.920]   How about a little Apple talk coming up in just a bit?
[00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:24.960]   But first, I want to talk about Squarespace,
[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:27.400]   the secret behind exceptional websites.
[00:48:27.400 --> 00:48:29.360]   I want you to go to squarespace.com.
[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:30.840]   We had so much fun the other day.
[00:48:30.840 --> 00:48:33.000]   Were you on the show, Barrett, then when we did this,
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:38.520]   we created a Squarespace site because Omala couldn't eat cupcakes.
[00:48:38.520 --> 00:48:39.360]   I was not here.
[00:48:39.360 --> 00:48:41.080]   I listened to that episode, actually.
[00:48:41.080 --> 00:48:41.600]   Yeah.
[00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:44.040]   And it just kind of gets out of control.
[00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:45.840]   But I use Squarespace myself.
[00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:46.340]   Do you?
[00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:46.340]   I do.
[00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:46.840]   For your blog?
[00:48:46.840 --> 00:48:47.340]   Yeah.
[00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:50.040]   Barrettunday.com is Squarespace powered proudly.
[00:48:50.040 --> 00:48:52.080]   Well, I don't want to put you on the spot,
[00:48:52.080 --> 00:48:53.280]   but you enjoy it.
[00:48:53.280 --> 00:48:53.780]   I do.
[00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:54.440]   Yeah, it's great.
[00:48:54.440 --> 00:48:55.440]   I mean, I'm actually--
[00:48:55.440 --> 00:48:58.840]   I used to use a lot of outside services--
[00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:00.320]   Post-flug ins and--
[00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:00.820]   Oh.
[00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:01.680]   --swit pick and things like that.
[00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:03.360]   I still like those tools, but I want
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:05.760]   to just bring more people to my own site
[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:06.800]   and test that out for a while.
[00:49:06.800 --> 00:49:09.760]   And I've got mobile posting set up via email.
[00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:10.440]   That's working out.
[00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:11.640]   The app's pretty cool.
[00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:14.040]   The iPad app for Squarespace is very exciting.
[00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:14.540]   It's awesome.
[00:49:14.540 --> 00:49:15.040]   Yeah.
[00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:17.400]   And I just-- I'd like the dragging and dropping.
[00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:18.640]   I want this column to be this wide.
[00:49:18.640 --> 00:49:20.680]   I just stretch it with my fingers almost.
[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:21.560]   I know it's beautiful.
[00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:22.720]   It makes me feel very powerful.
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:24.080]   How I think that makes me feel powerful.
[00:49:24.080 --> 00:49:24.520]   Powerful, powerful.
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:25.020]   Perfect.
[00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:25.520]   Yeah.
[00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:26.020]   So here's the deal.
[00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:27.480]   It's hosting plus the software.
[00:49:27.480 --> 00:49:29.160]   And I think that that's actually a nice way to go.
[00:49:29.160 --> 00:49:30.520]   The software's always up to date.
[00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:31.200]   It's always secure.
[00:49:31.200 --> 00:49:34.440]   When verses 6 comes out, which I keep saying,
[00:49:34.440 --> 00:49:35.080]   it's any day now.
[00:49:35.080 --> 00:49:35.920]   Any day now.
[00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:37.320]   You'll get it automatically.
[00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:38.440]   Really good hosting.
[00:49:38.440 --> 00:49:39.200]   Never goes down.
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:40.320]   You haven't had to go down yet.
[00:49:40.320 --> 00:49:40.960]   Oh, man.
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:42.720]   You can have billions of hits in hours.
[00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:43.220]   Yeah.
[00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:44.960]   You could just, as we did, just plug it on Twitch, which
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:46.840]   normally would bring any normal site down.
[00:49:46.840 --> 00:49:47.600]   No, no problem.
[00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:48.160]   Bring it on.
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:48.920]   I say bring it on.
[00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:50.040]   Bring it on, folks.
[00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:51.200]   Everybody go to Veritim.
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:52.720]   I'm right now.
[00:49:52.720 --> 00:49:54.400]   I should probably put some content on that website.
[00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:55.240]   Nah.
[00:49:55.240 --> 00:49:56.160]   Who needs content?
[00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:58.840]   I noticed the last update is from 1998.
[00:49:58.840 --> 00:50:00.080]   That was a good post, though.
[00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:01.120]   You wanted to leave it up for a moment.
[00:50:01.120 --> 00:50:01.620]   Oh, no.
[00:50:01.620 --> 00:50:02.360]   It's a keeper.
[00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:03.640]   Go to squarespace.com.
[00:50:03.640 --> 00:50:05.520]   Click the big green try it free button.
[00:50:05.520 --> 00:50:06.880]   You don't need a credit card to try it.
[00:50:06.880 --> 00:50:07.640]   I actually like this.
[00:50:07.640 --> 00:50:10.640]   You just need a name, a password, and your email address.
[00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:14.680]   And you, for two weeks, have full reign to do anything you
[00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:15.640]   want here.
[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:17.000]   So you can do anything.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:19.400]   Any of the Squarespace features, including their 60+
[00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:21.880]   designer templates, their great social integration
[00:50:21.880 --> 00:50:22.800]   for Flickr and Twitter.
[00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:24.080]   Yeah, not to go overboard on it.
[00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:25.880]   But the idea of letting you try things without asking
[00:50:25.880 --> 00:50:28.320]   for your credit card made me such a fan from the start.
[00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:28.800]   I know.
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:30.240]   I hate people ask you for your--
[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:32.200]   because they're counting on slippage, right?
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:32.680]   And like breaking--
[00:50:32.680 --> 00:50:33.600]   Right, you'll forget.
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:35.240]   And they're going to make a lot of money off of people
[00:50:35.240 --> 00:50:35.720]   forgetting.
[00:50:35.720 --> 00:50:38.160]   And that's just a bad business model.
[00:50:38.160 --> 00:50:40.160]   It's good for them, but it's just bad karma.
[00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:40.600]   I agree.
[00:50:40.600 --> 00:50:41.600]   I love it.
[00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:45.160]   I also love the fact that while you can import a movable type,
[00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:47.360]   WordPress type platter, blogger, very nicely,
[00:50:47.360 --> 00:50:48.920]   with all the images, all the links,
[00:50:48.920 --> 00:50:50.000]   you can also export.
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.720]   So you're never trapped.
[00:50:51.720 --> 00:50:52.840]   There's always a way--
[00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:55.920]   this is a company that's confident in his product.
[00:50:55.920 --> 00:50:57.840]   Yeah, people who make-- I love when you go to a site,
[00:50:57.840 --> 00:50:58.760]   like, how do I leave?
[00:50:58.760 --> 00:50:59.280]   Can't leave.
[00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:00.800]   And there's like, we have to call this number.
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:04.480]   And then you have to go to the corner of like 14th and 7th
[00:51:04.480 --> 00:51:06.880]   to meet a guy in a blue blazer who
[00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:10.000]   hands you a postcard that you drop in a mailbox.
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:10.440]   I've had--
[00:51:10.440 --> 00:51:11.280]   Let me go.
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:12.840]   I've had Vonage for four years.
[00:51:12.840 --> 00:51:14.440]   I haven't made a single call on it.
[00:51:14.440 --> 00:51:15.000]   Vonage.
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:16.600]   I haven't heard that name in four years.
[00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:19.000]   I can't cancel the damn thing.
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:20.120]   It's driving me crazy.
[00:51:20.120 --> 00:51:22.040]   One of these days, I'm going to have to take an afternoon,
[00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:22.520]   literally.
[00:51:22.520 --> 00:51:23.040]   Yeah.
[00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:23.520]   And cancel.
[00:51:23.520 --> 00:51:25.080]   And you have some confidence in your product.
[00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:26.160]   Let it sell itself.
[00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:27.200]   Squarespace.com.
[00:51:27.200 --> 00:51:30.240]   If you decide you want to keep the site, and I know you will,
[00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:32.720]   you just use the offer code TWIT and the number eight,
[00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:34.280]   all together, TWIT eight.
[00:51:34.280 --> 00:51:36.720]   And you'll get 10% off for the first six months
[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:38.640]   of your Squarespace site.
[00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:40.960]   It's-- Squarespace site started as low as $12 a month.
[00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:42.040]   That's hosting and software.
[00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:42.920]   And they're just great.
[00:51:42.920 --> 00:51:43.520]   I love them.
[00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:44.000]   You will too.
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:48.160]   Squarespace.com, use the offer code TWIT eight.
[00:51:48.160 --> 00:51:52.080]   So--
[00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:52.960]   You want to see something cool?
[00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:53.440]   Yeah.
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:53.960]   No.
[00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:54.080]   I don't like--
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:55.400]   My dog was sleeping this morning.
[00:51:55.400 --> 00:51:55.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:51:55.960 --> 00:51:58.840]   On the couch, it doesn't look like the Firefox logo?
[00:51:58.840 --> 00:52:00.000]   It does.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.320]   Oh, you don't have a--
[00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:02.440]   What's the URL?
[00:52:02.440 --> 00:52:04.000]   It's-- if you just go to nickbilton.com--
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:07.640]   on Twitter, sorry, twitter.nick.com/nickbilton.
[00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:09.600]   Twitter.com/shoo.
[00:52:09.600 --> 00:52:11.400]   Just go to my Twitter.
[00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:13.280]   I'm sorry, www.
[00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:13.760]   We got it.
[00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:14.280]   We got it.
[00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:15.280]   We actually must have a camera.
[00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:15.920]   Oh, wow.
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:17.440]   And it looks like the Firefox logo.
[00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:18.760]   Is that in fact a dog?
[00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:20.240]   It looks like-- it does look like a fox.
[00:52:20.240 --> 00:52:20.880]   It's the famous pixel.
[00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:21.640]   It's the famous pixel.
[00:52:21.640 --> 00:52:22.040]   It's the famous pixel.
[00:52:22.040 --> 00:52:24.720]   Oh, you broke the camera.
[00:52:24.720 --> 00:52:25.280]   Sorry.
[00:52:25.280 --> 00:52:26.440]   Anyway, I just thought that was fun.
[00:52:26.440 --> 00:52:27.960]   Way to go, OMG Chad.
[00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:28.320]   OMG Chad.
[00:52:28.320 --> 00:52:29.800]   Way to steal people's enjoyment.
[00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:31.400]   Yeah.
[00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:33.600]   Well, everybody should follow Nick on Twitter anyway.
[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:35.320]   Then you see such great postings as that.
[00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:37.480]   That's really more of a Google+ style posting.
[00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:38.040]   Oh, I should Google+--
[00:52:38.040 --> 00:52:39.560]   Are you verified on Google+?
[00:52:39.560 --> 00:52:40.000]   I'm not.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:41.840]   We were just discussing this in the car.
[00:52:41.840 --> 00:52:44.640]   Whoever is following me, whoever's watching the show,
[00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:47.600]   I want to know why Bartenday is verified and I'm not.
[00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:48.040]   OK.
[00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:48.200]   I just made--
[00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:49.920]   Show of hands around the table.
[00:52:49.920 --> 00:52:51.800]   Who here is verified?
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:52.920]   Ryan Block?
[00:52:52.920 --> 00:52:54.320]   Not Peter Rojas.
[00:52:54.320 --> 00:52:55.920]   I would report Google+.
[00:52:55.920 --> 00:52:56.680]   Wait, wait, wait.
[00:52:56.680 --> 00:52:58.040]   I'm not on Google+.
[00:52:58.040 --> 00:52:59.240]   If I was, I would--
[00:52:59.240 --> 00:53:00.320]   No, I'm not verified.
[00:53:00.320 --> 00:53:01.360]   No, I'm not verified.
[00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:02.040]   I actually looked for you.
[00:53:02.040 --> 00:53:02.600]   I'm trying to tell you.
[00:53:02.600 --> 00:53:03.080]   You're verified, Nick.
[00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:04.080]   That's what that checkbox is.
[00:53:04.080 --> 00:53:06.000]   That little check, I was looking for--
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:06.560]   You were lied to.
[00:53:06.560 --> 00:53:06.800]   I take that back.
[00:53:06.800 --> 00:53:08.120]   I apologize.
[00:53:08.120 --> 00:53:09.040]   No, it's not verified to me.
[00:53:09.040 --> 00:53:09.800]   How do you know if you're verified, Nick?
[00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:11.080]   Oh, these guys are all verified.
[00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:12.280]   No, they don't call you or anything.
[00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:13.400]   No, he's going to try to retry us.
[00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:13.880]   They just give you the latest.
[00:53:13.880 --> 00:53:15.080]   They know it's really me.
[00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:15.880]   Oh, no, no one.
[00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:16.520]   They didn't call me.
[00:53:16.520 --> 00:53:17.000]   No one called me.
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:30.440]   Nobody called me nothing.
[00:53:30.440 --> 00:53:31.280]   You can't do that, though.
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:33.760]   If you change your name, then they're not your real name.
[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:34.840]   And then they're going to come and--
[00:53:34.840 --> 00:53:35.880]   No, that's what happens on Twitter.
[00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:36.640]   They verify you.
[00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:38.200]   And if you change anything--
[00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:38.920]   No, not anything.
[00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:39.960]   Well, almost anything.
[00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:41.560]   You can change your bio without--
[00:53:41.560 --> 00:53:42.560]   The bio's the only thing.
[00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:43.960]   But you can't change URL.
[00:53:43.960 --> 00:53:44.640]   You can't--
[00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:46.020]   There's a few things you cannot change.
[00:53:46.020 --> 00:53:46.520]   Yeah.
[00:53:46.520 --> 00:53:48.560]   And if you do, then you have to wait till they
[00:53:48.560 --> 00:53:49.520]   dane to the right name.
[00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:50.520]   And you definitely can't change the name.
[00:53:50.520 --> 00:53:52.960]   Which I actually thought that it was going to be a very large,
[00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:53.800]   multicolored--
[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:55.240]   It's going to be a river river.
[00:53:55.240 --> 00:53:56.400]   --like thing across the--
[00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:57.400]   Like a metal.
[00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:57.920]   --verifers.
[00:53:57.920 --> 00:53:58.920]   You're disappointed.
[00:53:58.920 --> 00:53:59.480]   I'm disappointed.
[00:53:59.480 --> 00:54:01.840]   Because Google's got these beautiful colors in their palette.
[00:54:01.840 --> 00:54:03.440]   And they thought they would have used this on their--
[00:54:03.440 --> 00:54:05.520]   I was hoping a guy would show up in the studio right now.
[00:54:05.520 --> 00:54:06.520]   And hand us--
[00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:07.020]   And hand us.
[00:54:07.020 --> 00:54:07.520]   Yeah.
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:08.520]   You should have paper.
[00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:09.520]   But leave it as certificate.
[00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:10.880]   Believe it or not, as stupid in the first world of problems,
[00:54:10.880 --> 00:54:12.520]   this sounds like this is actually--
[00:54:12.520 --> 00:54:15.000]   this is typical at Google+, this is like a big thing
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.880]   on Google+, verification.
[00:54:17.880 --> 00:54:19.800]   I almost feel sorry for the Google+ team.
[00:54:19.800 --> 00:54:22.800]   Anything they do, it's suddenly a big story in Google+, you know?
[00:54:22.800 --> 00:54:24.560]   Well, are you guys enjoying Google+, by the way?
[00:54:24.560 --> 00:54:24.960]   I use it.
[00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:25.720]   I love it.
[00:54:25.720 --> 00:54:28.920]   I'm having a good time with it.
[00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:30.200]   It seems a little--
[00:54:30.200 --> 00:54:31.680]   I like the high engagement, but it also
[00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:33.480]   seems to demand a lot more engagement.
[00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:34.000]   It does.
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.320]   And it's very text heavy outside of the photo galleries,
[00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:37.680]   which I think are beautiful.
[00:54:37.680 --> 00:54:41.200]   But it's more active in certain little silos than I would like.
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:43.520]   And I'm not sure if I'm committed to a long term.
[00:54:43.520 --> 00:54:44.720]   But it's been fun to play around with.
[00:54:44.720 --> 00:54:46.400]   I noticed, though, that when I then go back to Twitter,
[00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:48.600]   everything seems like it's broken or disjointed.
[00:54:48.600 --> 00:54:49.680]   I can't-- it's like, why?
[00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:50.680]   That hasn't changed, Leo.
[00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:52.760]   That's always better.
[00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:53.720]   Well, speak in English.
[00:54:53.720 --> 00:54:55.640]   What are you saying?
[00:54:55.640 --> 00:54:56.880]   Wait, what are you talking about?
[00:54:56.880 --> 00:54:58.240]   The vernacular on Twitter?
[00:54:58.240 --> 00:55:00.280]   Just the fact that you only have 140 characters.
[00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:02.600]   So here's an example.
[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:03.480]   I definitely--
[00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:07.120]   When you're 96%, no, I'm not logged in.
[00:55:07.120 --> 00:55:07.760]   OK.
[00:55:07.760 --> 00:55:08.680]   Right?
[00:55:08.680 --> 00:55:09.320]   I'm not logged in.
[00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:10.920]   That's like digital self-esteem issues.
[00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:11.880]   No, I follow you, Nick.
[00:55:11.880 --> 00:55:12.360]   I'm not logged in.
[00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:13.560]   No, so what were you saying?
[00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:17.480]   So this tweet, I'm definitely in the 96% RT @brick.
[00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:17.680]   Oh, yeah.
[00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:18.080]   Great headline.
[00:55:18.080 --> 00:55:18.400]   It's no sense.
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:19.240]   Hashtags like a lot of stuff.
[00:55:19.240 --> 00:55:20.600]   Hashtag the onion.
[00:55:20.600 --> 00:55:22.680]   And so more and more, this seems like gibberish to me.
[00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:23.200]   Oh, completely.
[00:55:23.200 --> 00:55:24.160]   As I use Google+.
[00:55:24.160 --> 00:55:26.160]   By the way, and we don't mean specifically your Twitter.
[00:55:26.160 --> 00:55:26.920]   No, no, no, no.
[00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:27.400]   I get it.
[00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:28.320]   I don't disagree.
[00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:29.560]   It totally makes no sense.
[00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:31.480]   No, because what you do is you write what you want to write.
[00:55:31.480 --> 00:55:32.640]   And then your 17 characters are--
[00:55:32.640 --> 00:55:33.440]   And then you cut everything.
[00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:34.160]   And you start cutting.
[00:55:34.160 --> 00:55:39.000]   I have to say, I'm surprised that hashtags became a thing
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:40.800]   that even non-geeks use.
[00:55:40.800 --> 00:55:41.960]   I mean, it's so confusing.
[00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:43.720]   Not just because they take away from the characters
[00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:44.440]   you need to write.
[00:55:44.440 --> 00:55:45.000]   Exactly.
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:45.520]   Right?
[00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:45.920]   But because--
[00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:46.200]   Weird.
[00:55:46.200 --> 00:55:46.760]   Yeah, it is weird.
[00:55:46.760 --> 00:55:48.040]   Well, I think of--
[00:55:48.040 --> 00:55:48.600]   I don't see.
[00:55:48.600 --> 00:55:51.160]   I think of hashtags as a--
[00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:52.480]   especially as implemented on Twitter.
[00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:54.120]   And as I presume-- or I'm not following you.
[00:55:54.120 --> 00:55:54.640]   I'm sorry.
[00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:55.440]   They're like C++ types.
[00:55:55.440 --> 00:55:59.200]   As I presume that Google+ would implement it
[00:55:59.200 --> 00:56:02.160]   is as a pre-done search.
[00:56:02.160 --> 00:56:02.680]   Correct.
[00:56:02.680 --> 00:56:04.080]   So when you click on a hashtag, you
[00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:05.520]   do a search for that content.
[00:56:05.520 --> 00:56:06.840]   And I think that that--
[00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:08.320]   as far as I'm concerned, that works.
[00:56:08.320 --> 00:56:08.880]   It's really useful.
[00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:09.760]   And it shouldn't count.
[00:56:09.760 --> 00:56:10.920]   It's a canned search.
[00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:13.000]   It should not count against your character count.
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:14.160]   Oh, is that what we're saying?
[00:56:14.160 --> 00:56:14.640]   I'm sorry.
[00:56:14.640 --> 00:56:15.600]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:17.200]   I'm saying on Twitter, a hashtag
[00:56:17.200 --> 00:56:18.760]   shouldn't count against your character count.
[00:56:18.760 --> 00:56:20.480]   It's already so low.
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:21.640]   It's got to be pitier.
[00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:23.720]   Now I know you're thinking, how can I abuse this?
[00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:25.840]   But I'm just saying, as a matter of policy.
[00:56:25.840 --> 00:56:27.480]   Well, I suppose URLs shouldn't either.
[00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:29.040]   But that's not what Twitter is all about.
[00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:30.480]   It's 140 characters.
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:31.440]   Get used to it.
[00:56:31.440 --> 00:56:32.880]   I hate Twitter.
[00:56:32.880 --> 00:56:33.680]   You really?
[00:56:33.680 --> 00:56:34.680]   I love Twitter.
[00:56:34.680 --> 00:56:35.520]   I love Twitter.
[00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:36.520]   I even love Twitter all day.
[00:56:36.520 --> 00:56:38.080]   You prefer that to everything else.
[00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:39.560]   Facebook, Google+.
[00:56:39.560 --> 00:56:41.640]   I hate using Facebook now.
[00:56:41.640 --> 00:56:42.720]   I do too.
[00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:43.240]   I can't.
[00:56:43.240 --> 00:56:43.720]   Did you actually--
[00:56:43.720 --> 00:56:44.200]   I quit for me.
[00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:45.800]   I quit a year and a half ago.
[00:56:45.800 --> 00:56:48.560]   So you have six more months other than holding your data?
[00:56:48.560 --> 00:56:49.080]   I quit.
[00:56:49.080 --> 00:56:50.160]   I guess so.
[00:56:50.160 --> 00:56:51.440]   I stopped using it and never went back.
[00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:52.600]   I quit and I came back.
[00:56:52.600 --> 00:56:53.600]   What were you quit saying?
[00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:54.640]   So you used Google+?
[00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:56.000]   What's the difference?
[00:56:56.000 --> 00:56:59.200]   I-- well, because with Google+, I have a lot more control
[00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:00.280]   over what's shared.
[00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:01.800]   I know that it's default public, so I'm
[00:57:01.800 --> 00:57:04.120]   really careful about what I put on there.
[00:57:04.120 --> 00:57:05.120]   And also--
[00:57:05.120 --> 00:57:08.320]   I'm not sure that the Google+ is not the public.
[00:57:08.320 --> 00:57:11.960]   No, when I'm posting stuff, I default to public,
[00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:13.400]   so I know that.
[00:57:13.400 --> 00:57:17.000]   But also with Facebook, I don't like Facebook Connect.
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:18.080]   I don't like the idea of--
[00:57:18.080 --> 00:57:19.160]   But every site uses it.
[00:57:19.160 --> 00:57:19.680]   Oh.
[00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:19.680]   Does it just--
[00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:19.680]   Oh.
[00:57:19.680 --> 00:57:20.180]   --gdgt.
[00:57:20.180 --> 00:57:20.680]   Can I make a segue?
[00:57:20.680 --> 00:57:21.200]   Can I make a segue?
[00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:21.720]   Sure, we use it.
[00:57:21.720 --> 00:57:22.160]   You have to.
[00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:22.640]   Do you have to.
[00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:25.320]   Leo, I'm a masterful segue is about to happen right here.
[00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:26.520]   Oh, thank god, because I'm so sick.
[00:57:26.520 --> 00:57:27.040]   I'm so sick.
[00:57:27.040 --> 00:57:27.540]   I'm so sick.
[00:57:27.540 --> 00:57:28.040]   Do you still have music?
[00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:28.880]   We got a story.
[00:57:28.880 --> 00:57:30.240]   Duh-duh-duh-duh.
[00:57:30.240 --> 00:57:32.360]   About the German government telling its officials
[00:57:32.360 --> 00:57:34.880]   to take the like button off of its sites.
[00:57:34.880 --> 00:57:35.320]   Really?
[00:57:35.320 --> 00:57:39.160]   Yeah, it's in our story queue.
[00:57:39.160 --> 00:57:40.000]   They are so worried.
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:40.520]   Private.
[00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:40.520]   Private-y.
[00:57:40.520 --> 00:57:41.960]   Private-y, yeah.
[00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:42.460]   Right?
[00:57:42.460 --> 00:57:43.400]   No like buttons.
[00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:44.360]   And do they make a--
[00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:46.400]   They said government officers should not
[00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:48.560]   have Facebook pages to strip like buttons.
[00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:48.920]   I agree.
[00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:51.080]   Because of the data collection policies of Facebook
[00:57:51.080 --> 00:57:54.960]   and the profile building that goes on when users like things.
[00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:56.480]   I don't like Germany anyway.
[00:57:56.480 --> 00:57:58.160]   But isn't it even that like--
[00:57:58.160 --> 00:57:59.720]   Even if you don't click the button,
[00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:00.520]   they're still tracking--
[00:58:00.520 --> 00:58:01.320]   --for an ambivalence.
[00:58:01.320 --> 00:58:01.840]   --when you log in.
[00:58:01.840 --> 00:58:03.520]   The virtue of the button being there,
[00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:05.040]   the same thing with I presume Facebook
[00:58:05.040 --> 00:58:07.400]   connect and everything else is that that's a tracking cookie.
[00:58:07.400 --> 00:58:09.600]   Because it shows your friends, even if you don't say like.
[00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:10.800]   It knows who you are.
[00:58:10.800 --> 00:58:12.240]   But that by putting-- so for instance,
[00:58:12.240 --> 00:58:13.680]   if I put a like button on my website--
[00:58:13.680 --> 00:58:14.680]   --it's sending data back to Facebook.
[00:58:14.680 --> 00:58:15.520]   --it sends back data--
[00:58:15.520 --> 00:58:16.800]   --for everybody who visits.
[00:58:16.800 --> 00:58:17.480]   Yeah.
[00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:19.520]   So the Germans don't-- so they're actually--
[00:58:19.520 --> 00:58:21.520]   they're setting up a fine structure.
[00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:23.560]   They're encouraging all their citizens not to do it.
[00:58:23.560 --> 00:58:26.080]   But they have a new thing called Shiza Book.
[00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:27.200]   No.
[00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:28.160]   Not so.
[00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:28.920]   I liked it.
[00:58:28.920 --> 00:58:30.440]   Didn't go over so well.
[00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:32.360]   [BEEP]
[00:58:32.360 --> 00:58:34.760]   I like your papa lio.
[00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:37.000]   Well, you're the last one.
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:43.000]   South Korea has a class action suit against Apple.
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:45.360]   27,000 plaintiffs.
[00:58:45.360 --> 00:58:47.320]   This is based on that whole thing about Apple
[00:58:47.320 --> 00:58:48.800]   storing that information.
[00:58:48.800 --> 00:58:51.680]   Ironically, Microsoft did the same thing about a month ago,
[00:58:51.680 --> 00:58:55.000]   published the information on the web, and nobody noticed.
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:55.760]   I didn't notice.
[00:58:55.760 --> 00:58:58.040]   These type of things always resolve themselves
[00:58:58.040 --> 00:58:59.120]   in the same way, right?
[00:58:59.120 --> 00:59:01.480]   The company that's doing it becomes aware
[00:59:01.480 --> 00:59:02.200]   that they're doing it.
[00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:03.000]   And stop.
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:03.500]   Yeah.
[00:59:03.500 --> 00:59:04.640]   It's the same thing every time.
[00:59:04.640 --> 00:59:05.280]   Or gets caught.
[00:59:05.280 --> 00:59:06.240]   That's the question.
[00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:07.880]   Is it they became aware or they got caught?
[00:59:07.880 --> 00:59:10.040]   I got stuck with my original statement.
[00:59:10.040 --> 00:59:12.680]   I think in Microsoft's case, you're right.
[00:59:12.680 --> 00:59:13.720]   They just became aware.
[00:59:13.720 --> 00:59:14.000]   I think so.
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:15.240]   Apple, I'm not so convinced.
[00:59:15.240 --> 00:59:16.520]   Google, I'm not so convinced.
[00:59:16.520 --> 00:59:19.160]   I think they wanted that information.
[00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:20.600]   We know they wanted that information.
[00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:21.520]   They were going to make--
[00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:22.000]   They said it helped.
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:23.680]   They would help them with a new traffic application
[00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:24.960]   that they were showing.
[00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:26.600]   There you go.
[00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:28.360]   So we are hearing, speaking of Apple,
[00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:31.520]   that some of the rumors we've heard are untrue and some
[00:59:31.520 --> 00:59:32.280]   are true.
[00:59:32.280 --> 00:59:35.280]   We had Cara Swisher here last week who said, no,
[00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:38.280]   I stand by it October, not September 7th,
[00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:39.680]   for the next iPhone.
[00:59:39.680 --> 00:59:40.880]   Is that what you're hearing, too?
[00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:43.160]   I was hearing that it was going to be the end of September
[00:59:43.160 --> 00:59:45.240]   beginning of October.
[00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:48.560]   I think you've really kind of covered your bases on that.
[00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:49.080]   Well, yes.
[00:59:49.080 --> 00:59:50.440]   And I also heard that it possibly
[00:59:50.440 --> 00:59:52.680]   would be September or December.
[00:59:52.680 --> 00:59:53.640]   So after now--
[00:59:53.640 --> 00:59:55.200]   August, July, and definitely out.
[00:59:55.200 --> 00:59:56.280]   You'll think there'll be two phones.
[00:59:56.280 --> 00:59:59.080]   It will be from some point here till the end of the year.
[00:59:59.080 --> 01:00:02.400]   I think that there's going to be a less expensive alternative.
[01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:03.840]   The story that the journal reported,
[01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:05.200]   and I'll put money on this, there
[01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:08.520]   is not going to be a little mini-sized iPhone for small people.
[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:10.640]   It is not.
[01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:13.200]   Why does Apple hate small people now?
[01:00:13.200 --> 01:00:16.240]   It is not going to exist.
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:19.400]   We do hear that the next iPad, which will not be out this year,
[01:00:19.400 --> 01:00:21.160]   contrary to false rumors--
[01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:22.640]   Also not for small people.
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:23.520]   Not for small people.
[01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:27.040]   We'll have a retina display 2048 by 1536.
[01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:28.040]   That makes sense.
[01:00:28.040 --> 01:00:29.040]   Well, the other thing that I have--
[01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:30.040]   It does hurt.
[01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:31.680]   And I don't know when this is going to happen.
[01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:32.960]   But this little button right here--
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:33.480]   The home button?
[01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:34.480]   Yeah.
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:35.240]   I know what I mean.
[01:00:35.240 --> 01:00:36.080]   You know what?
[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:38.600]   I was thinking the iPhone has too many buttons.
[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:41.520]   So that would be a good choice.
[01:00:41.520 --> 01:00:42.320]   One fewer button--
[01:00:42.320 --> 01:00:42.960]   Well, eventually--
[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:43.520]   What's the--
[01:00:43.520 --> 01:00:44.360]   It'll be a gesture.
[01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:44.960]   There's no point.
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:46.520]   This is just all irrelevant.
[01:00:46.520 --> 01:00:48.000]   It's eventually just going to be a screen.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:49.520]   We're going to make the screen larger in the next--
[01:00:49.520 --> 01:00:50.080]   And that's how we--
[01:00:50.080 --> 01:00:53.560]   Samsung is suing them because it looks exactly like a galaxy.
[01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:54.720]   They'll be like a galaxy.
[01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:55.720]   Yeah.
[01:00:55.720 --> 01:00:56.720]   Squish gesture.
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:00:57.360]   It's going to be something--
[01:00:57.360 --> 01:00:58.360]   I actually do believe that.
[01:00:58.360 --> 01:01:02.520]   And I believe that that's why during this lawsuit, Samsung very clearly said, OK, but
[01:01:02.520 --> 01:01:04.440]   we want to see the next iPhone.
[01:01:04.440 --> 01:01:06.920]   Because I do believe that in fact it will look just like the galaxy.
[01:01:06.920 --> 01:01:07.920]   Yeah.
[01:01:07.920 --> 01:01:09.720]   And I think Samsung thought that would be--
[01:01:09.720 --> 01:01:10.720]   Yeah, big screen.
[01:01:10.720 --> 01:01:11.720]   No, make some curvy.
[01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:14.600]   Are we going to talk about the new Fusion Garage tablet?
[01:01:14.600 --> 01:01:15.600]   Let's please.
[01:01:15.600 --> 01:01:16.600]   What is the new Fusion Garage?
[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:17.600]   I would love to know what you're talking about.
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:18.600]   Do everyone miss this story?
[01:01:18.600 --> 01:01:19.600]   I guess they picked the wrong week to launch.
[01:01:19.600 --> 01:01:23.440]   Well, they had announced Fusion at this tablet at CES a year and a half ago.
[01:01:23.440 --> 01:01:24.440]   At an ovals time.
[01:01:24.440 --> 01:01:26.440]   No, this was the Tabco--
[01:01:26.440 --> 01:01:27.280]   Sounds like the one.
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:28.280]   The one that now knows.
[01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:29.280]   Yeah.
[01:01:29.280 --> 01:01:30.280]   Yeah.
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:31.280]   All that thing.
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:32.280]   They're doing this like the Juju.
[01:01:32.280 --> 01:01:33.280]   Yeah, the Juju.
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:34.680]   So they have the-- it's like the Grid 10.
[01:01:34.680 --> 01:01:36.680]   And so Fusion Garage is like--
[01:01:36.680 --> 01:01:40.320]   And I like the website, juju.com because apparently it's down.
[01:01:40.320 --> 01:01:41.320]   Juju means--
[01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:42.320]   Well, at least--
[01:01:42.320 --> 01:01:44.640]   I'm not sure that they even had juju.com.
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:46.840]   Well, that's what it's like.
[01:01:46.840 --> 01:01:47.840]   It wasn't--
[01:01:47.840 --> 01:01:48.840]   The second result on Google.
[01:01:48.840 --> 01:01:49.840]   It's on Google.
[01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:50.840]   I don't know if it's true.
[01:01:50.840 --> 01:01:51.840]   Google never lies.
[01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:55.080]   You can go to fusiongarage.com introducing the Grid.
[01:01:55.080 --> 01:01:58.400]   Because HB's touchpad wasn't good enough.
[01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:00.000]   Look, it looks completely different.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:01.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:03.400]   It does a lot better than it is.
[01:02:03.400 --> 01:02:04.400]   That way, though.
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:07.480]   This is also-- and this is interesting-- a smartphone.
[01:02:07.480 --> 01:02:08.480]   So they didn't hide it.
[01:02:08.480 --> 01:02:10.640]   They have a phone and they have a tablet.
[01:02:10.640 --> 01:02:12.800]   And what they did is they forked Android.
[01:02:12.800 --> 01:02:14.280]   So they've owned Android 2.3.
[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:15.880]   But you can totally do that.
[01:02:15.880 --> 01:02:16.880]   Yeah, you can do that.
[01:02:16.880 --> 01:02:17.880]   But this doesn't really mean to be dark places.
[01:02:17.880 --> 01:02:18.880]   Anyone else feels like dark places.
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:21.880]   I don't think this is going to do that well.
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:24.960]   The Grid will run you $499 for Wi-Fi only.
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:27.800]   $599 for Wi-Fi and 3G.
[01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:28.320]   Wow.
[01:02:28.320 --> 01:02:29.320]   What does that sound like?
[01:02:29.320 --> 01:02:32.360]   They're going to get everyone who bought a Juju one of them
[01:02:32.360 --> 01:02:33.840]   for free.
[01:02:33.840 --> 01:02:34.360]   Really?
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:35.360]   What is a Juju?
[01:02:35.360 --> 01:02:37.160]   It's like 450 people or so.
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:38.440]   What does that-- what do you mean?
[01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:40.440]   Juju was their original tablet, the Fusion Garage.
[01:02:40.440 --> 01:02:40.940]   Yeah.
[01:02:40.940 --> 01:02:42.600]   So remember this is the one where they were working on--
[01:02:42.600 --> 01:02:43.480]   It was the crunchpad.
[01:02:43.480 --> 01:02:44.640]   They were working on it with Aireington
[01:02:44.640 --> 01:02:45.520]   and they had a big falling out.
[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:46.640]   They're still suing each other.
[01:02:46.640 --> 01:02:47.560]   Sure.
[01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:49.240]   Or some Aireington suing them.
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:50.480]   I predict failure.
[01:02:50.480 --> 01:02:51.760]   The Grid 10 on the--
[01:02:51.760 --> 01:02:52.280]   On the most--
[01:02:52.280 --> 01:02:53.280]   On the most-- or the tablet.
[01:02:53.280 --> 01:02:53.780]   The tablet.
[01:02:53.780 --> 01:02:55.000]   Actually on everything.
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:56.000]   All of it.
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:02:57.000]   So the whole failure--
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:58.740]   I think that this is a smart idea, though,
[01:02:58.740 --> 01:03:02.000]   is to take a stable operating system with some good support.
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.320]   It probably, all they did was skin it.
[01:03:04.320 --> 01:03:05.920]   They skin it and did some other things.
[01:03:05.920 --> 01:03:08.480]   And they can't guarantee that all apps will run on it.
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:08.980]   Oh.
[01:03:08.980 --> 01:03:09.980]   That sounds great.
[01:03:09.980 --> 01:03:12.280]   I agree with the good sound in the chat room.
[01:03:12.280 --> 01:03:14.080]   It needs to be $299 or less.
[01:03:14.080 --> 01:03:15.080]   It's making $2.
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:15.580]   They all do it.
[01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:16.580]   They do that about most health.
[01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:17.540]   They all do it's $2.
[01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:18.040]   Exactly.
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:20.680]   If you're going to compete with the iPad at the same price,
[01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:21.180]   you're up.
[01:03:21.180 --> 01:03:22.480]   You should just sell the iPad.
[01:03:22.480 --> 01:03:23.560]   You just out of your mind.
[01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:26.140]   Oh, we have $99 here.
[01:03:26.140 --> 01:03:27.580]   Are we actually going to buy this?
[01:03:27.580 --> 01:03:28.080]   Is that--
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:29.060]   You know, even that's not enough,
[01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:31.580]   because our coast has been selling Android-based tablets
[01:03:31.580 --> 01:03:34.460]   for much less than Apple for a couple of years
[01:03:34.460 --> 01:03:35.320]   and is not doing it.
[01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:36.220]   I don't think it was doing it.
[01:03:36.220 --> 01:03:37.020]   They're doing OK.
[01:03:37.020 --> 01:03:40.860]   But I mean, their strategy is just to be a low-end provider.
[01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:41.660]   I mean, that's--
[01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:42.860]   Yeah, I don't want to buy the tablets.
[01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:43.860]   They're like that for us.
[01:03:43.860 --> 01:03:46.140]   You know, we need something that works like the iPad,
[01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:47.500]   but costs a lot less.
[01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:51.540]   I think that would be the value prop there.
[01:03:51.540 --> 01:03:55.280]   I wonder who is actually going to be left in this market
[01:03:55.280 --> 01:03:56.360]   at the end.
[01:03:56.360 --> 01:03:57.600]   Is it going to be Amazon?
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:03:58.080]   This guy.
[01:03:58.080 --> 01:03:58.720]   Is it going to be--
[01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:01.520]   But can they with a tablet that has little holes?
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:02.440]   Who is actually?
[01:04:02.440 --> 01:04:04.760]   There'll be thumb holes in the tablet.
[01:04:04.760 --> 01:04:05.280]   I'm listening.
[01:04:05.280 --> 01:04:07.880]   I mean, who's going to make it through this?
[01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:11.320]   I think it's going to be Amazon, absolutely.
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:12.720]   And possibly the Windows 8 stuff.
[01:04:12.720 --> 01:04:13.240]   I mean, we'll see.
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:16.680]   I think the Windows tablet, if it ran the Windows Mobile
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:18.120]   and had some kind of integration with--
[01:04:18.120 --> 01:04:19.800]   Plus, it wouldn't be fitting for the people who
[01:04:19.800 --> 01:04:21.360]   created the tablet PC.
[01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:23.360]   Yes, to actually sell tablets.
[01:04:23.360 --> 01:04:26.020]   There's going to be some spot for Android in here, too, right?
[01:04:26.020 --> 01:04:28.100]   I mean, Android is so phenomenally successful
[01:04:28.100 --> 01:04:29.100]   out of Amazon.
[01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:32.220]   But the tablet experience is incredibly--
[01:04:32.220 --> 01:04:32.780]   The zoom.
[01:04:32.780 --> 01:04:33.780]   --is incredible.
[01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:36.500]   Right, but it was still on V1, right?
[01:04:36.500 --> 01:04:38.340]   So we have to compare it to that first Android phone.
[01:04:38.340 --> 01:04:39.180]   The G1 was not even--
[01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:41.300]   Give them a couple of years, maybe it's a different story.
[01:04:41.300 --> 01:04:43.940]   But a couple of years of Amazon Android--
[01:04:43.940 --> 01:04:46.540]   It's a long time, especially when you're invested in an OS.
[01:04:46.540 --> 01:04:48.540]   Absolutely.
[01:04:48.540 --> 01:04:51.400]   I wrote this story once, a couple of months ago,
[01:04:51.400 --> 01:04:53.240]   about-- I used to work in advertising.
[01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:55.200]   There was this big ad guy that said to me
[01:04:55.200 --> 01:04:58.000]   that selling deodorant is not about--
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:00.320]   once you've got the client, like once you already
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:01.520]   have someone buying it.
[01:05:01.520 --> 01:05:03.720]   Once you buy deodorant, you stick with it for the rest
[01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:04.240]   of your life.
[01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:06.040]   And I think the same thing applies to these OSs,
[01:05:06.040 --> 01:05:06.840]   these mobile OSs.
[01:05:06.840 --> 01:05:07.760]   Once you get into this--
[01:05:07.760 --> 01:05:09.000]   You think they're sticking?
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:10.200]   I'm not sure about the phone, though,
[01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:12.640]   because I think with Android phones, especially two years
[01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:14.280]   down the road, you'll look and see whatever's new,
[01:05:14.280 --> 01:05:15.240]   and maybe you'll change.
[01:05:15.240 --> 01:05:16.640]   But if you get hooked in-- especially
[01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:18.360]   with contact-syncing calendar stuff,
[01:05:18.360 --> 01:05:19.360]   if you start to use those.
[01:05:19.360 --> 01:05:19.860]   It depends.
[01:05:19.860 --> 01:05:21.580]   I think Apple's got a nice lock in like that.
[01:05:21.580 --> 01:05:23.920]   I think people who buy Apple phones by and large
[01:05:23.920 --> 01:05:25.220]   will go Apple next time.
[01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:26.380]   Yeah, especially with the Apple--
[01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:28.780]   But in the tablet, it's the buy-e or get more on the tablet.
[01:05:28.780 --> 01:05:31.180]   We have seen this before, right, with the iPod.
[01:05:31.180 --> 01:05:32.860]   The iPod is completely dominated.
[01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:34.020]   It could be three-player market.
[01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:37.020]   And the only other players who were able to grab--
[01:05:37.020 --> 01:05:39.260]   market show were able to grab four or 5%.
[01:05:39.260 --> 01:05:43.260]   I think Sandis get 1.7%, or something like that.
[01:05:43.260 --> 01:05:45.100]   And that was by positioning themselves as basically
[01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:47.420]   low-cost alternatives.
[01:05:47.420 --> 01:05:50.480]   There's a risk that the foreseeable future of the tablet
[01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:52.320]   market, at least as Apple defines it, right?
[01:05:52.320 --> 01:05:53.120]   Sure.
[01:05:53.120 --> 01:05:53.920]   Will be--
[01:05:53.920 --> 01:05:55.920]   Well, as Apple does define it, I think that's a fair enough.
[01:05:55.920 --> 01:05:58.720]   It will be-- the iPad will have 75%, 80% of that market.
[01:05:58.720 --> 01:06:00.160]   So we're going to take a break, come back,
[01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:00.680]   and just a bit.
[01:06:00.680 --> 01:06:04.920]   The TV networks are declaring war on online viewers.
[01:06:04.920 --> 01:06:05.920]   We'll talk about that.
[01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:08.600]   Second pair of Todhde Thurston is here from the Onion.
[01:06:08.600 --> 01:06:11.280]   Yay, America's finest news on whiskey Friday.
[01:06:11.280 --> 01:06:12.920]   Always on Friday.
[01:06:12.920 --> 01:06:13.720]   On Friday.
[01:06:13.720 --> 01:06:14.360]   I have some whiskey.
[01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:15.040]   Should I go get it?
[01:06:15.040 --> 01:06:15.720]   Yes, you should.
[01:06:15.720 --> 01:06:16.240]   All right.
[01:06:16.240 --> 01:06:17.240]   I want to work for him.
[01:06:17.240 --> 01:06:18.300]   I have whiskey.
[01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:18.860]   We have whiskey.
[01:06:18.860 --> 01:06:20.260]   Nick and I have whiskey time.
[01:06:20.260 --> 01:06:23.740]   We have whiskey Fridays and whiskey Thursdays.
[01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:25.140]   Is McAllen's days?
[01:06:25.140 --> 01:06:25.940]   McAllen's more than all of you.
[01:06:25.940 --> 01:06:27.260]   Could you live with McAllen?
[01:06:27.260 --> 01:06:29.020]   I could die with McAllen.
[01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:31.380]   Chad, well, Chad's busy on the gym.
[01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:32.580]   But if somebody would go in my office,
[01:06:32.580 --> 01:06:34.700]   there's a big red box.
[01:06:34.700 --> 01:06:36.580]   And if you could get us some shot glasses.
[01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:37.620]   The key is exploding.
[01:06:37.620 --> 01:06:38.620]   It's the first time that you--
[01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:39.580]   It's amazing.
[01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:40.760]   Is this the first time that we've
[01:06:40.760 --> 01:06:42.580]   drank McAllen's on the show?
[01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:43.700]   I didn't know you liked McAllen.
[01:06:43.700 --> 01:06:44.260]   I love it.
[01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:45.060]   Let's do this.
[01:06:45.060 --> 01:06:45.600]   Wow.
[01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:46.100]   All right.
[01:06:46.100 --> 01:06:46.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:06:46.940 --> 01:06:47.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:06:47.940 --> 01:06:48.940]   We're going to take a break.

[01:18:31.940 --> 01:18:32.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:18:32.940 --> 01:18:33.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:18:33.940 --> 01:18:34.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:18:34.940 --> 01:18:35.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:18:35.940 --> 01:18:36.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:37.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:18:37.940 --> 01:18:38.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:18:38.940 --> 01:18:39.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:18:39.940 --> 01:18:40.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:18:40.940 --> 01:18:41.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:18:41.940 --> 01:18:42.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:18:42.940 --> 01:18:43.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:44.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:18:44.940 --> 01:18:45.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:18:45.940 --> 01:18:46.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:18:46.940 --> 01:18:47.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:18:47.940 --> 01:18:48.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:18:48.940 --> 01:18:49.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:18:49.940 --> 01:18:50.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:18:50.940 --> 01:18:51.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:18:51.940 --> 01:18:52.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:18:52.940 --> 01:18:53.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:18:53.940 --> 01:18:54.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:18:54.940 --> 01:18:55.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:18:55.940 --> 01:18:56.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:18:56.940 --> 01:18:57.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:18:57.940 --> 01:18:58.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:18:58.940 --> 01:18:59.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:18:59.940 --> 01:19:00.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:19:00.940 --> 01:19:01.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:19:01.940 --> 01:19:02.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:19:02.940 --> 01:19:03.940]   We're going to take a break.

[01:19:09.940 --> 01:19:10.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:19:10.940 --> 01:19:11.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:19:11.940 --> 01:19:12.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:19:12.940 --> 01:19:13.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:19:13.940 --> 01:19:14.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:19:14.940 --> 01:19:15.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:19:15.940 --> 01:19:16.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:19:16.940 --> 01:19:18.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:19:18.940 --> 01:19:19.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:19:19.940 --> 01:19:20.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:19:20.940 --> 01:19:21.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:19:21.940 --> 01:19:22.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:23.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:19:23.940 --> 01:19:24.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:19:24.940 --> 01:19:25.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:19:25.940 --> 01:19:26.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:19:26.940 --> 01:19:27.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:19:27.940 --> 01:19:28.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:19:28.940 --> 01:19:29.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:19:29.940 --> 01:19:30.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:19:30.940 --> 01:19:31.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:19:31.940 --> 01:19:32.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:19:32.940 --> 01:19:33.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:19:33.940 --> 01:19:34.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:19:34.940 --> 01:19:35.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:19:35.940 --> 01:19:36.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:19:36.940 --> 01:19:37.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:19:37.940 --> 01:19:38.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:19:38.940 --> 01:19:39.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:19:39.940 --> 01:19:40.940]   We're going to take a break.
[01:19:40.940 --> 01:19:41.940]   We'll change.
[01:19:41.940 --> 01:19:42.940]   It's going to take a few years.
[01:19:42.940 --> 01:19:45.940]   We're impatient because we see where things should be.
[01:19:45.940 --> 01:19:46.940]   Eventually they do get there.
[01:19:46.940 --> 01:19:48.940]   You can't fight it.
[01:19:48.940 --> 01:19:55.940]   I think one of the things that the networks are teaching people is that that seven-day window
[01:19:55.940 --> 01:19:59.940]   or with the case of Netflix and a lot of movie studios keeping to that 30-day window
[01:19:59.940 --> 01:20:03.940]   for movies is that a lot of people don't really care about watching something in the first week.
[01:20:03.940 --> 01:20:07.940]   I'm still trying to catch up on episodes of 30 Rock from nine months ago.
[01:20:07.940 --> 01:20:10.940]   I prefer to do it that way actually because it allows you to watch them back to back.
[01:20:10.940 --> 01:20:13.940]   I'm now watching Breaking Bad starting at the beginning.
[01:20:13.940 --> 01:20:14.940]   Oh, that is such an amazing show.
[01:20:14.940 --> 01:20:17.940]   I'm glad I didn't see it at first because I'm watching...
[01:20:17.940 --> 01:20:18.940]   We actually watched four episodes.
[01:20:18.940 --> 01:20:19.940]   We do this the only way to watch this.
[01:20:19.940 --> 01:20:21.940]   That's the only way to watch this one o'clock in the morning.
[01:20:21.940 --> 01:20:25.940]   But then you're sad because you just like the whole show and it can't have just one.
[01:20:25.940 --> 01:20:26.940]   Exactly.
[01:20:26.940 --> 01:20:29.940]   But now it's to the point where I do get toarn it because I want it.
[01:20:29.940 --> 01:20:30.940]   Yeah.
[01:20:30.940 --> 01:20:36.940]   By the way, the producers of Breaking Bad made a lot of money on me because I'm buying every season.
[01:20:36.940 --> 01:20:38.940]   They're making 30-year bucks a season.
[01:20:38.940 --> 01:20:39.940]   That's how I do it as well.
[01:20:39.940 --> 01:20:41.940]   I think there are revenue models.
[01:20:41.940 --> 01:20:45.940]   I have to say one of the reasons this exists is because I kept saying to tech TV,
[01:20:45.940 --> 01:20:49.940]   "Why are you building a brick and mortar business when the future is online?"
[01:20:49.940 --> 01:20:52.940]   And they said, "Because we have to. It's a cable business.
[01:20:52.940 --> 01:20:53.940]   It's a brick and mortar business."
[01:20:53.940 --> 01:20:56.940]   And we created this without cable deals for that very reason.
[01:20:56.940 --> 01:20:58.940]   Maybe that's the thing.
[01:20:58.940 --> 01:21:04.940]   That ultimately, if you're a creator, if you're a producer, we've got to create the channel so that they can make money
[01:21:04.940 --> 01:21:09.940]   by selling direct. Instead of selling it to a network, sell it direct to your customers.
[01:21:09.940 --> 01:21:13.940]   The guy who makes Breaking Bad next time should say, "Maybe I shouldn't do it through a network.
[01:21:13.940 --> 01:21:15.940]   Maybe I should do it direct to customers."
[01:21:15.940 --> 01:21:18.940]   And that's possible for a few.
[01:21:18.940 --> 01:21:20.940]   Or to YouTube.
[01:21:20.940 --> 01:21:22.940]   Flix is producing content for that very role.
[01:21:22.940 --> 01:21:25.940]   YouTube has this grant program that they're going to launch.
[01:21:25.940 --> 01:21:26.940]   So it's happening.
[01:21:26.940 --> 01:21:27.940]   I agree with Peter.
[01:21:27.940 --> 01:21:30.940]   With Happen to Music, we had the same types of arguments.
[01:21:30.940 --> 01:21:31.940]   It's hilarious.
[01:21:31.940 --> 01:21:33.940]   We wanted to see Spotify nine years ago.
[01:21:33.940 --> 01:21:41.940]   It just took a long time for the TV industry to be making the exact same mistakes in the exact same...
[01:21:41.940 --> 01:21:44.940]   But dude, dude, dude, it's different lawyers.
[01:21:44.940 --> 01:21:58.940]   Well, I think the thing is, if you make a TV show for a major network, the scale of the business is totally different than what the guild makes.
[01:21:58.940 --> 01:22:01.940]   And you're not going to see a soprano's made.
[01:22:01.940 --> 01:22:04.940]   You need cash up front. You need millions of dollars in episode.
[01:22:04.940 --> 01:22:06.940]   We're talking about this only a matter of time, though.
[01:22:06.940 --> 01:22:09.940]   Well, we bootstrapped this.
[01:22:09.940 --> 01:22:11.940]   You make the first one, you make cheap.
[01:22:11.940 --> 01:22:13.940]   The next one, you make a little more expensive.
[01:22:13.940 --> 01:22:18.940]   But you're not trying to build a business that does 150 million dollars a year.
[01:22:18.940 --> 01:22:20.940]   The other problem is that...
[01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:22.940]   More importantly, I think you're not trying to maintain one.
[01:22:22.940 --> 01:22:24.940]   That already makes a hundred thousand dollars a year.
[01:22:24.940 --> 01:22:29.940]   The other problem is that fiction is hit-driven, and so there's a lot of shows that get made and money lost.
[01:22:29.940 --> 01:22:32.940]   For every good show, there's five bad shows.
[01:22:32.940 --> 01:22:35.940]   You need Deepak as the subsidizing a lot of capitalization.
[01:22:35.940 --> 01:22:38.940]   No, but if it's priced right, I mean, I buy stuff on iTunes all the time.
[01:22:38.940 --> 01:22:39.940]   I do too.
[01:22:39.940 --> 01:22:40.940]   I buy whole seasons of stuff.
[01:22:40.940 --> 01:22:42.940]   It's worse than not to see the ads.
[01:22:42.940 --> 01:22:43.940]   And it's quick.
[01:22:43.940 --> 01:22:45.940]   Imagine a marketing world where every show runs.
[01:22:45.940 --> 01:22:49.940]   Do you buy them when the new, do you have to wait or do you buy them after the fact?
[01:22:49.940 --> 01:22:51.940]   I buy them, I buy them after the fact.
[01:22:51.940 --> 01:22:53.940]   If I can Netflix them, I can all wait.
[01:22:53.940 --> 01:22:55.940]   But isn't it better to have...
[01:22:55.940 --> 01:22:57.940]   In other words, you can go buy a season of the wire.
[01:22:57.940 --> 01:23:01.940]   But if you do a season of the last few weeks, you might as well just be watching it on TV.
[01:23:01.940 --> 01:23:02.940]   I keep working.
[01:23:02.940 --> 01:23:03.940]   I keep working.
[01:23:03.940 --> 01:23:05.940]   Because you're going to DVR it anyway, and then you can skip the ads.
[01:23:05.940 --> 01:23:08.940]   I think part of the problem is how do you promote and market a show?
[01:23:08.940 --> 01:23:09.940]   Exactly.
[01:23:09.940 --> 01:23:13.940]   The networks are not just a filter, they're also a marketing machine.
[01:23:13.940 --> 01:23:15.940]   And how do you do that in a world?
[01:23:15.940 --> 01:23:20.940]   Look at the number of shows that exist today, and fling all of them into a market yourself mode.
[01:23:20.940 --> 01:23:25.940]   Every showrunner and producer has to develop a direct relationship with a consumer.
[01:23:25.940 --> 01:23:28.940]   You have to re-aggregate that stuff, just like iTunes did for music.
[01:23:28.940 --> 01:23:29.940]   You don't have every artist.
[01:23:29.940 --> 01:23:30.940]   Some artists do it well.
[01:23:30.940 --> 01:23:32.940]   Maybe iTunes becomes that out later.
[01:23:32.940 --> 01:23:33.940]   Exactly.
[01:23:33.940 --> 01:23:37.940]   Maybe Netflix does, maybe some combination of people building their own networks.
[01:23:37.940 --> 01:23:41.940]   Here's what I'm saying, like eventually, well, the people that have opted out of YouTube,
[01:23:41.940 --> 01:23:44.940]   that have cut the cord, that you can build up to people.
[01:23:44.940 --> 01:23:45.940]   When does the Fox need?
[01:23:45.940 --> 01:23:46.940]   We're not there yet.
[01:23:46.940 --> 01:23:48.940]   It really is a chicken and egg right now.
[01:23:48.940 --> 01:23:50.940]   I think the people at this table are there.
[01:23:50.940 --> 01:23:52.940]   The business isn't there.
[01:23:52.940 --> 01:23:54.940]   I'm all about cancel stuff.
[01:23:54.940 --> 01:23:56.940]   I'm not our first fictional show.
[01:23:56.940 --> 01:23:57.940]   Here's...
[01:23:57.940 --> 01:23:59.940]   And by the way, Paul, you hit the nail on the head.
[01:23:59.940 --> 01:24:00.940]   I missed the tweet.
[01:24:00.940 --> 01:24:02.940]   He says, "Well, we're going to have fiction on this network."
[01:24:02.940 --> 01:24:06.940]   And my dream is to get a David Simon to say, "David, don't next time...
[01:24:06.940 --> 01:24:08.940]   How much does it cost to film the wire?"
[01:24:08.940 --> 01:24:09.940]   What if you just did audio?
[01:24:09.940 --> 01:24:14.940]   What if you just had actors sitting around a table and you visualized it, you could do it much, much cheaper?
[01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:15.940]   Well, by the way...
[01:24:15.940 --> 01:24:16.940]   I want somebody like it to...
[01:24:16.940 --> 01:24:18.940]   I want somebody like this...
[01:24:18.940 --> 01:24:20.940]   I want these guys to animate the...
[01:24:20.940 --> 01:24:24.940]   What about the Ricky Guevès show, which is essentially what we're doing to make it.
[01:24:24.940 --> 01:24:25.940]   And then he animates it.
[01:24:25.940 --> 01:24:28.940]   So, I don't know if that adds anything to the show.
[01:24:28.940 --> 01:24:30.940]   The journalist wants to say something.
[01:24:30.940 --> 01:24:32.940]   Well, so people are complaining that...
[01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:34.940]   Trust him, he's wearing wooden glasses.
[01:24:34.940 --> 01:24:35.940]   What do you...
[01:24:35.940 --> 01:24:36.940]   George Washington?
[01:24:36.940 --> 01:24:37.940]   It'd be fantastic if I was.
[01:24:37.940 --> 01:24:39.940]   Because I would have invented lightning.
[01:24:39.940 --> 01:24:42.940]   Or you'd spend, frankly, I think.
[01:24:42.940 --> 01:24:43.940]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:24:43.940 --> 01:24:46.940]   So, everyone's complaining that we're yabbering on, it's the alcohol.
[01:24:46.940 --> 01:24:48.940]   So, I want to move along to...
[01:24:48.940 --> 01:24:49.940]   That's...
[01:24:49.940 --> 01:24:51.940]   Worry about phones zapping sperm.
[01:24:51.940 --> 01:24:53.940]   See, spapping zerm is much more interesting.
[01:24:53.940 --> 01:24:55.940]   Phones zapping sperm.
[01:24:55.940 --> 01:24:56.940]   So, are you saying that...?
[01:24:56.940 --> 01:25:01.940]   So, I've actually read a lot of reports about cell phones doing this.
[01:25:01.940 --> 01:25:02.940]   Okay.
[01:25:02.940 --> 01:25:03.940]   And cell phones causing radiation.
[01:25:03.940 --> 01:25:04.940]   Yep.
[01:25:04.940 --> 01:25:05.940]   And they're all conflicting.
[01:25:05.940 --> 01:25:06.940]   Different journals.
[01:25:06.940 --> 01:25:08.940]   There's no conclusive evidence.
[01:25:08.940 --> 01:25:09.940]   There's no conclusive evidence.
[01:25:09.940 --> 01:25:10.940]   Well, no, the...
[01:25:10.940 --> 01:25:11.940]   And actually, what happened...
[01:25:11.940 --> 01:25:13.940]   The recent pseudo-decision...
[01:25:13.940 --> 01:25:14.940]   No, the world health...
[01:25:14.940 --> 01:25:18.940]   And cell health organization took a very weak evidence study...
[01:25:18.940 --> 01:25:19.940]   Yeah.
[01:25:19.940 --> 01:25:26.940]   And put out a fairly weak warning that most people who know anything about this have frankly said, "No, there's no evidence."
[01:25:26.940 --> 01:25:30.940]   So, you know, I hate to tell you, but we've got a ham station there with 100 watts.
[01:25:30.940 --> 01:25:33.940]   Your phone has, you know, 100 milliamps.
[01:25:33.940 --> 01:25:34.940]   I mean, a milliwatts.
[01:25:34.940 --> 01:25:35.940]   It's much less...
[01:25:35.940 --> 01:25:36.940]   But it's not near his sperm.
[01:25:36.940 --> 01:25:37.940]   I think he's so powerful.
[01:25:37.940 --> 01:25:39.940]   Well, it is if you sit on that ham station.
[01:25:39.940 --> 01:25:40.940]   He's not...
[01:25:40.940 --> 01:25:41.940]   He's a cat.
[01:25:41.940 --> 01:25:42.940]   He's a cat.
[01:25:42.940 --> 01:25:43.940]   He's a human.
[01:25:43.940 --> 01:25:46.940]   Cell phones emit microwave radiation and not ionizing radiation.
[01:25:46.940 --> 01:25:47.940]   Thank you.
[01:25:47.940 --> 01:25:48.940]   And my father-in-law...
[01:25:48.940 --> 01:25:49.940]   Their not the frequency that's dangerous.
[01:25:49.940 --> 01:25:50.940]   Is a cancer researcher.
[01:25:50.940 --> 01:25:55.940]   And I had a big discussion with him about this and he said, "Look, if it turns out the cell phone's caused cancer, and certainly is possible since you never know..."
[01:25:55.940 --> 01:25:57.940]   Well, it's a relatively new technology.
[01:25:57.940 --> 01:25:58.940]   It would be...
[01:25:58.940 --> 01:25:59.940]   It would mean...
[01:25:59.940 --> 01:26:00.940]   The easy to fix.
[01:26:00.940 --> 01:26:05.940]   That the radiation is having an effect on human cells that has never been observed before.
[01:26:05.940 --> 01:26:08.940]   Because microwave radiation heats things up.
[01:26:08.940 --> 01:26:11.940]   It doesn't cause, you know, like the electrons to detach stuff.
[01:26:11.940 --> 01:26:12.940]   The disruption, yeah.
[01:26:12.940 --> 01:26:13.940]   Like, which we have with ionizing radiation.
[01:26:13.940 --> 01:26:14.940]   And that's the problem.
[01:26:14.940 --> 01:26:15.940]   Which is why it causes cancer.
[01:26:15.940 --> 01:26:16.940]   Right.
[01:26:16.940 --> 01:26:17.940]   Okay.
[01:26:17.940 --> 01:26:18.940]   So we settled it then.
[01:26:18.940 --> 01:26:19.940]   So we settled it.
[01:26:19.940 --> 01:26:20.940]   That was an option on that anymore.
[01:26:20.940 --> 01:26:21.940]   But we just...
[01:26:21.940 --> 01:26:22.940]   That's the third news that's broken on Twitter today.
[01:26:22.940 --> 01:26:23.940]   It's amazing.
[01:26:23.940 --> 01:26:24.940]   Libyan rebels to cicula cancer.
[01:26:24.940 --> 01:26:25.940]   What was the other one?
[01:26:25.940 --> 01:26:26.940]   The other one was dying.
[01:26:26.940 --> 01:26:27.940]   Sky was dying.
[01:26:27.940 --> 01:26:28.940]   Sky was dying.
[01:26:28.940 --> 01:26:29.940]   Sky was dying.
[01:26:29.940 --> 01:26:30.940]   I agree.
[01:26:30.940 --> 01:26:31.940]   The company that's being bought is buying...
[01:26:31.940 --> 01:26:32.940]   I got a big story.
[01:26:32.940 --> 01:26:34.940]   Oxford English Dictionary has added cyberbullying.
[01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:35.940]   Okay.
[01:26:35.940 --> 01:26:36.940]   Sexting.
[01:26:36.940 --> 01:26:37.940]   Good.
[01:26:37.940 --> 01:26:38.940]   So we're going to be talking about the word "tweet".
[01:26:38.940 --> 01:26:39.940]   Yeah.
[01:26:39.940 --> 01:26:40.940]   Yeah.
[01:26:40.940 --> 01:26:41.940]   Text speak.
[01:26:41.940 --> 01:26:42.940]   What?
[01:26:42.940 --> 01:26:43.940]   And my favorite, text speak.
[01:26:43.940 --> 01:26:44.940]   You never heard that before?
[01:26:44.940 --> 01:26:45.940]   No, me neither.
[01:26:45.940 --> 01:26:46.940]   And I think you just make this couple of some.
[01:26:46.940 --> 01:26:52.140]   And my favorite, they have added to the Oxford English Dictionary, the definitive book of
[01:26:52.140 --> 01:26:54.940]   the English language, the word "woot".
[01:26:54.940 --> 01:26:55.940]   Yeah.
[01:26:55.940 --> 01:26:56.940]   With zero?
[01:26:56.940 --> 01:26:57.940]   No.
[01:26:57.940 --> 01:26:58.940]   They spell it wrong.
[01:26:58.940 --> 01:26:59.940]   Oh, wait.
[01:26:59.940 --> 01:27:00.940]   The thing...
[01:27:00.940 --> 01:27:02.940]   The guy who runs the Oxford English Dictionary now is a younger guy, I guess.
[01:27:02.940 --> 01:27:03.940]   Jesse Schidelauer.
[01:27:03.940 --> 01:27:08.940]   And he made a comment that... he made a statement about something I thought was really kind
[01:27:08.940 --> 01:27:09.940]   of interesting.
[01:27:09.940 --> 01:27:13.940]   You know, you talk about how people use words the wrong way, like ironic is a classic example.
[01:27:13.940 --> 01:27:14.940]   Right.
[01:27:14.940 --> 01:27:15.940]   Isn't that ironic?
[01:27:15.940 --> 01:27:19.940]   His basic explanation of this was that words mean what most people think they mean.
[01:27:19.940 --> 01:27:23.940]   And if most people are using the word "ironic" wrong, then that's what it means.
[01:27:23.940 --> 01:27:24.940]   That's what it means.
[01:27:24.940 --> 01:27:25.940]   Right.
[01:27:25.940 --> 01:27:27.940]   In other words, we think of it as coincidental, essentially.
[01:27:27.940 --> 01:27:31.940]   But at his point was simply that if that is how we use it, then that's what it is.
[01:27:31.940 --> 01:27:32.940]   That's what it is.
[01:27:32.940 --> 01:27:36.860]   And I ID, which by the way, I have in my office because I love it.
[01:27:36.860 --> 01:27:37.860]   That's the point of the OED.
[01:27:37.860 --> 01:27:42.220]   They find the first time that that word was used in literature and then show updates to
[01:27:42.220 --> 01:27:43.940]   show how the words meaning is made.
[01:27:43.940 --> 01:27:45.940]   Because it changes over time.
[01:27:45.940 --> 01:27:47.940]   I want to view Jesse Schidelauer from my book.
[01:27:47.940 --> 01:27:50.340]   Who's the fantastic guy, really, really smart.
[01:27:50.340 --> 01:27:53.940]   And we were just talking about how acronyms, you know, are acronyms going to take over society.
[01:27:53.940 --> 01:27:57.940]   And there's a lot of acronyms that we use that we don't even know where they come from.
[01:27:57.940 --> 01:27:58.940]   FTES sweater is an acronym.
[01:27:58.940 --> 01:27:59.940]   Yeah.
[01:27:59.940 --> 01:28:00.940]   Black.
[01:28:00.940 --> 01:28:01.940]   It's so nice.
[01:28:01.940 --> 01:28:03.940]   And I went with something so horribly.
[01:28:03.940 --> 01:28:04.940]   What did he say?
[01:28:04.940 --> 01:28:05.940]   I said STF you.
[01:28:05.940 --> 01:28:07.940]   And I said sweater.
[01:28:07.940 --> 01:28:18.740]   Well, he was saying stuff which extra added thermal extra radiation from with Bartone
[01:28:18.740 --> 01:28:19.740]   Day has holes in fingers.
[01:28:19.740 --> 01:28:21.940]   You can tell how this breaks down.
[01:28:21.940 --> 01:28:22.940]   Writer?
[01:28:22.940 --> 01:28:23.940]   Not a writer.
[01:28:23.940 --> 01:28:24.940]   So go ahead.
[01:28:24.940 --> 01:28:28.660]   So anyway, so I spoke to him and we were talking about, you know, because there was all this
[01:28:28.660 --> 01:28:30.660]   fear that LOL speak would take over society.
[01:28:30.660 --> 01:28:31.660]   Right.
[01:28:31.660 --> 01:28:32.660]   Never actually, you know, crashed.
[01:28:32.660 --> 01:28:33.660]   Communicate again.
[01:28:33.660 --> 01:28:35.140]   And he said these things have been around forever.
[01:28:35.140 --> 01:28:37.660]   And they mostly come from doctors and government and so on.
[01:28:37.660 --> 01:28:38.660]   And even okay.
[01:28:38.660 --> 01:28:39.660]   Comes from the word.
[01:28:39.660 --> 01:28:40.660]   I'm all correct.
[01:28:40.660 --> 01:28:41.660]   I was in a court trial last week.
[01:28:41.660 --> 01:28:48.740]   I was on the jury in which the defense attorney repeatedly referred to LOL as lots of laughs.
[01:28:48.740 --> 01:28:49.740]   And I wanted to hit him.
[01:28:49.740 --> 01:28:50.740]   Did you correct?
[01:28:50.740 --> 01:28:51.740]   No, you're in the jury.
[01:28:51.740 --> 01:28:52.740]   You're supposed to shut up and take notes.
[01:28:52.740 --> 01:28:54.740]   But you're also part of a jury case.
[01:28:54.740 --> 01:28:56.380]   It was like, oh, it was a great case.
[01:28:56.380 --> 01:28:58.980]   It was one of the cases that to catch a predator.
[01:28:58.980 --> 01:29:00.620]   You know where they had those guys?
[01:29:00.620 --> 01:29:01.620]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:29:01.620 --> 01:29:03.340]   It was here and happened here in Petaluma.
[01:29:03.340 --> 01:29:06.140]   They had this kind of talk about this.
[01:29:06.140 --> 01:29:07.140]   I am.
[01:29:07.140 --> 01:29:08.140]   Okay.
[01:29:08.140 --> 01:29:11.420]   After the jury's over, the only thing I can't do in California state law is negotiate with
[01:29:11.420 --> 01:29:13.260]   you for a book deal for three months.
[01:29:13.260 --> 01:29:14.260]   I was actually going to bring that up.
[01:29:14.260 --> 01:29:15.260]   I know.
[01:29:15.260 --> 01:29:16.260]   I'm sorry.
[01:29:16.260 --> 01:29:17.260]   I can't but talk to me in a couple of 90 days.
[01:29:17.260 --> 01:29:18.260]   Okay.
[01:29:18.260 --> 01:29:19.260]   The book's called Lots of Laughs.
[01:29:19.260 --> 01:29:20.260]   Duration rights.
[01:29:20.260 --> 01:29:21.260]   No, it's actually quite interesting.
[01:29:21.260 --> 01:29:26.340]   You know, and in fact it's relevant because the case was about this company called Perfic
[01:29:26.340 --> 01:29:31.340]   Perverted Justice, which is originally a vigilante group that decoyed adults pretending
[01:29:31.340 --> 01:29:36.180]   to be teenage girls online, getting the adults to get in a sexual chat, and then out
[01:29:36.180 --> 01:29:38.980]   of them by publishing the chat on their website.
[01:29:38.980 --> 01:29:43.900]   And then worse, publishing the guy's name, the names of his co-workers, family, friends,
[01:29:43.900 --> 01:29:46.700]   and said on the website, go give this guy a hard time.
[01:29:46.700 --> 01:29:47.700]   Are you serious?
[01:29:47.700 --> 01:29:48.700]   Yeah, I've heard about it.
[01:29:48.700 --> 01:29:53.340]   So then NBC comes along and says, you know, well, this would be really a good TV show.
[01:29:53.340 --> 01:29:54.340]   Wow.
[01:29:54.340 --> 01:29:55.340]   And they--
[01:29:55.340 --> 01:29:56.340]   Ron Oolle.
[01:29:56.340 --> 01:29:59.380]   They hire him for $100,000 in episode to decoy people to these houses.
[01:29:59.380 --> 01:30:04.900]   They get the local police come in and arrest--so what happens is the guy gets decoyed, comes
[01:30:04.900 --> 01:30:07.340]   to the house, thinks it's a 13-year-old.
[01:30:07.340 --> 01:30:10.380]   It turns out it's Chris Hanson, reporter for Dateline NBC.
[01:30:10.380 --> 01:30:11.380]   Not the guy you want to see.
[01:30:11.380 --> 01:30:14.220]   Yeah, that must give you kind of a weird feeling when Chris comes out.
[01:30:14.220 --> 01:30:15.980]   He just busted for cheating on his wife.
[01:30:15.980 --> 01:30:16.980]   He was busted for something.
[01:30:16.980 --> 01:30:17.980]   Wasn't he really?
[01:30:17.980 --> 01:30:20.220]   And I think there was some recorded element to it too.
[01:30:20.220 --> 01:30:21.220]   Oh, no.
[01:30:21.220 --> 01:30:22.220]   That's ironic.
[01:30:22.220 --> 01:30:23.220]   Isn't that--
[01:30:23.220 --> 01:30:24.220]   Is that a misuse of that word or--
[01:30:24.220 --> 01:30:25.220]   Yeah.
[01:30:25.220 --> 01:30:26.220]   It's a good idea.
[01:30:26.220 --> 01:30:27.220]   It is, yeah.
[01:30:27.220 --> 01:30:28.220]   But in the old days, it wouldn't have been ironic.
[01:30:28.220 --> 01:30:29.220]   Would have been in sarcasm?
[01:30:29.220 --> 01:30:30.220]   No, I'm not.
[01:30:30.220 --> 01:30:31.700]   Technically not ironic, but we're going to go with it.
[01:30:31.700 --> 01:30:32.700]   I don't know.
[01:30:32.700 --> 01:30:33.700]   I'm going to have to read my OED.
[01:30:33.700 --> 01:30:35.500]   Wait, so what ends up happening with the case?
[01:30:35.500 --> 01:30:37.260]   The case gets thrown out by the judge.
[01:30:37.260 --> 01:30:40.660]   We watch the jury-- we watch the entire prosecution case.
[01:30:40.660 --> 01:30:45.260]   They interview the decoy, 40-year-old woman who pretends to be a 13.
[01:30:45.260 --> 01:30:49.780]   There's no sexual chat in this until halfway-- half an hour into the chat.
[01:30:49.780 --> 01:30:51.820]   She says, can I get your phone number?
[01:30:51.820 --> 01:30:55.180]   And they have another woman, another 47-year-old woman who calls up in a baby dog.
[01:30:55.180 --> 01:30:56.180]   And they say, I'm going to call you a voice.
[01:30:56.180 --> 01:30:57.180]   Yes.
[01:30:57.180 --> 01:30:58.180]   Hi.
[01:30:58.180 --> 01:31:01.020]   You going to come see me in my hot tub?
[01:31:01.020 --> 01:31:05.260]   And this poor guy is a 21-year-old sailor on leave, says, yeah, yeah.
[01:31:05.260 --> 01:31:07.060]   And now the check gets sexual.
[01:31:07.060 --> 01:31:09.060]   So the prosecution makes the whole case.
[01:31:09.060 --> 01:31:10.060]   Yikes.
[01:31:10.060 --> 01:31:12.420]   The judge dismisses it, says, that's entrapment.
[01:31:12.420 --> 01:31:13.420]   Throws it out.
[01:31:13.420 --> 01:31:14.420]   Throws it out.
[01:31:14.420 --> 01:31:16.460]   But it's-- I can't remember why I brought it up.
[01:31:16.460 --> 01:31:17.460]   Have some more of my account.
[01:31:17.460 --> 01:31:18.460]   No.
[01:31:18.460 --> 01:31:19.460]   Let's talk about abbreviations.
[01:31:19.460 --> 01:31:20.460]   The other part of this is--
[01:31:20.460 --> 01:31:21.460]   I don't know.
[01:31:21.460 --> 01:31:26.420]   I'm not sure if you're going to be a person, but I'm not sure if you're going to be a
[01:31:26.420 --> 01:31:27.420]   person.
[01:31:27.420 --> 01:31:28.420]   I'm not sure if you're going to be a person.
[01:31:28.420 --> 01:31:29.420]   I'm not sure if you're going to be a person.
[01:31:29.420 --> 01:31:30.420]   I'm not sure if you're going to be a person.
[01:31:30.420 --> 01:31:31.420]   I'm not sure if you're going to be a person.
[01:31:31.420 --> 01:31:32.420]   I'm not sure if you're going to be a person.
[01:31:32.420 --> 01:31:33.420]   I'm not sure if you're going to be a person.
[01:31:33.420 --> 01:31:34.420]   I'm not sure if you're going to be a person.
[01:31:34.420 --> 01:31:35.420]   I'm not sure if you're going to be a person.
[01:31:35.420 --> 01:31:36.420]   I'm not sure if you're going to be a person.
[01:31:36.420 --> 01:31:37.420]   I'm not sure if you're going to be a person.
[01:31:37.420 --> 01:31:38.420]   I'm not sure if you're going to be a person.
[01:31:38.420 --> 01:31:39.420]   I'm not sure if you're going to be a person.
[01:31:39.420 --> 01:31:46.420]   I was really pleased that the judge had the good sense to say, "You know, that's really
[01:31:46.420 --> 01:31:47.420]   incredible."
[01:31:47.420 --> 01:31:50.420]   I actually did a case very similar, but it wasn't to do with the internet.
[01:31:50.420 --> 01:31:54.420]   This was 2006 when people were still very afraid that predators were coming into our
[01:31:54.420 --> 01:31:56.420]   houses on the internet all the time.
[01:31:56.420 --> 01:31:57.420]   So about that book deal?
[01:31:57.420 --> 01:31:58.420]   Yeah.
[01:31:58.420 --> 01:31:59.420]   I could talk to you nine or two months.
[01:31:59.420 --> 01:32:02.420]   It was actually-- they did the attorney said, "Are we going to hear about this on
[01:32:02.420 --> 01:32:03.420]   Twitter?"
[01:32:03.420 --> 01:32:04.420]   I said, "No, you know you know."
[01:32:04.420 --> 01:32:05.420]   No.
[01:32:05.420 --> 01:32:06.420]   No.
[01:32:06.420 --> 01:32:09.420]   I'm not sure if you've been to media now since you've been to Twitch series.
[01:32:09.420 --> 01:32:11.420]   To catch a peritone day.
[01:32:11.420 --> 01:32:12.420]   Whoa!
[01:32:12.420 --> 01:32:19.420]   We put decoys in chat rooms all over the country hoping Peritone Day Thurston would stop by.
[01:32:19.420 --> 01:32:20.420]   So what's this story with the other?
[01:32:20.420 --> 01:32:21.420]   He stopped by to all of them.
[01:32:21.420 --> 01:32:22.420]   Yup.
[01:32:22.420 --> 01:32:25.420]   Pulls critical reviews of anti-gay marriage bridal store.
[01:32:25.420 --> 01:32:29.420]   Wait, are we-- is this the same story from the past ten years?
[01:32:29.420 --> 01:32:31.420]   No, it's-- there's a lot of new stories.
[01:32:31.420 --> 01:32:32.420]   There's always a new one.
[01:32:32.420 --> 01:32:38.420]   A New Jersey bridal store refused to sell a bridal gown to a gay woman.
[01:32:38.420 --> 01:32:39.420]   Okay.
[01:32:39.420 --> 01:32:40.420]   Yikes.
[01:32:40.420 --> 01:32:41.420]   So they don't like money.
[01:32:41.420 --> 01:32:42.420]   Yeah.
[01:32:42.420 --> 01:32:43.420]   So they're already a bad business.
[01:32:43.420 --> 01:32:44.420]   That's not all they don't like.
[01:32:44.420 --> 01:32:46.420]   It's called "Here Comes the Brides store."
[01:32:46.420 --> 01:32:48.420]   And she went in to find a bridal gown.
[01:32:48.420 --> 01:32:51.420]   She was going to marry her longtime partner, Cucan, now in New York.
[01:32:51.420 --> 01:32:52.420]   Yes.
[01:32:52.420 --> 01:32:53.420]   Which is why Nick left.
[01:32:53.420 --> 01:32:54.420]   Mm-hmm.
[01:32:54.420 --> 01:33:01.420]   And the manager said you're partaking in an illegal app marrying your partner and said,
[01:33:01.420 --> 01:33:02.420]   "I'm not going to work with you."
[01:33:02.420 --> 01:33:03.420]   Now I think this is a perfect--
[01:33:03.420 --> 01:33:04.420]   Which is a jersey.
[01:33:04.420 --> 01:33:05.420]   This is in Jersey.
[01:33:05.420 --> 01:33:07.420]   It's in Josie, which it is, I guess, illegal.
[01:33:07.420 --> 01:33:09.420]   But it's not illegal to buy a wedding gown.
[01:33:09.420 --> 01:33:10.420]   No, that's true.
[01:33:10.420 --> 01:33:11.420]   It's a really good marriage.
[01:33:11.420 --> 01:33:12.420]   Yeah.
[01:33:12.420 --> 01:33:14.420]   So she says, "You come from a nice Jewish family.
[01:33:14.420 --> 01:33:15.420]   It's a shame you're gay."
[01:33:15.420 --> 01:33:16.420]   Is that what she said really?
[01:33:16.420 --> 01:33:17.420]   Yes.
[01:33:17.420 --> 01:33:18.420]   How did he even come off?
[01:33:18.420 --> 01:33:19.420]   Who's the weirdest--
[01:33:19.420 --> 01:33:20.420]   Do you always talk to him about this?
[01:33:20.420 --> 01:33:21.420]   What technology is this?
[01:33:21.420 --> 01:33:22.420]   Because this is the question.
[01:33:22.420 --> 01:33:24.420]   Yelp review.
[01:33:24.420 --> 01:33:30.420]   A number of yelpers put reviews in like, they don't deserve a business license and they don't
[01:33:30.420 --> 01:33:31.420]   deserve your business.
[01:33:31.420 --> 01:33:32.420]   Right.
[01:33:32.420 --> 01:33:33.420]   It's not like money.
[01:33:33.420 --> 01:33:36.420]   Another yelper said, "Someone capable of such--" This is what yelp is made for.
[01:33:36.420 --> 01:33:37.420]   Yeah.
[01:33:37.420 --> 01:33:38.420]   Screaming.
[01:33:38.420 --> 01:33:39.420]   It is literally the point of yelp.
[01:33:39.420 --> 01:33:42.900]   So every yelp should embrace this and stop-- 'cause they've gotten so much trouble for
[01:33:42.900 --> 01:33:47.300]   being deceitful about these things and trying to manage them and so on.
[01:33:47.300 --> 01:33:50.420]   I think they should just embrace it and be like, "We are the Wikipedia."
[01:33:50.420 --> 01:33:51.420]   Exactly.
[01:33:51.420 --> 01:33:52.420]   It's sad.
[01:33:52.420 --> 01:33:53.420]   Where are the YouTube commentary?
[01:33:53.420 --> 01:33:54.420]   Yes.
[01:33:54.420 --> 01:33:55.420]   The YouTube commentary.
[01:33:55.420 --> 01:33:56.420]   Every place is gay.
[01:33:56.420 --> 01:33:58.420]   Everybody's a liar.
[01:33:58.420 --> 01:33:59.420]   Everybody's a racist.
[01:33:59.420 --> 01:34:01.180]   I don't like this world.
[01:34:01.180 --> 01:34:04.260]   I think that it's too difficult for a company like this to manage.
[01:34:04.260 --> 01:34:05.700]   How can they-- I mean, okay.
[01:34:05.700 --> 01:34:09.420]   With this situation, they're managing every store in the--
[01:34:09.420 --> 01:34:13.580]   Well, so Leo, just to clarify the details, a bunch of negative reviews of this business
[01:34:13.580 --> 01:34:14.580]   were pulled on yelp because--
[01:34:14.580 --> 01:34:15.580]   Because--
[01:34:15.580 --> 01:34:16.580]   By yelp.
[01:34:16.580 --> 01:34:17.580]   By yelp.
[01:34:17.580 --> 01:34:20.220]   Because they were not-- because they were about this business's practices.
[01:34:20.220 --> 01:34:21.220]   Yeah.
[01:34:21.220 --> 01:34:22.220]   Because discriminatory practices are called sex.
[01:34:22.220 --> 01:34:24.220]   But I think that's a legitimate consumer concern.
[01:34:24.220 --> 01:34:25.220]   I do too.
[01:34:25.220 --> 01:34:26.220]   I think that's--
[01:34:26.220 --> 01:34:28.740]   There were people who would not go there or would go there because of these issues.
[01:34:28.740 --> 01:34:32.300]   And just from a management-- I mean, when you think about the issues that ISPs have
[01:34:32.300 --> 01:34:33.300]   had and--
[01:34:33.300 --> 01:34:34.300]   Yeah.
[01:34:34.300 --> 01:34:37.380]   --tried to escape and try to manage the content that travels over their pipes, you know,
[01:34:37.380 --> 01:34:38.380]   Verizon.net is irresponsible.
[01:34:38.380 --> 01:34:40.380]   But as soon as you start drilling next--
[01:34:40.380 --> 01:34:41.380]   Like you are indeed.
[01:34:41.380 --> 01:34:43.380]   --and when you admit that you have control--
[01:34:43.380 --> 01:34:44.380]   That's bad.
[01:34:44.380 --> 01:34:46.380]   --you not only weaken your position no longer.
[01:34:46.380 --> 01:34:47.380]   But every other platform--
[01:34:47.380 --> 01:34:48.860]   There's no DMCA safe harbor for you.
[01:34:48.860 --> 01:34:49.860]   Right.
[01:34:49.860 --> 01:34:50.860]   So then other companies that carry user content.
[01:34:50.860 --> 01:34:51.860]   I agree with this content in this.
[01:34:51.860 --> 01:34:52.860]   Yeah.
[01:34:52.860 --> 01:34:53.860]   It's just-- it's inconsistent.
[01:34:53.860 --> 01:34:54.860]   Yeah.
[01:34:54.860 --> 01:34:57.960]   And it's actually-- I think more than yelp, it hurts other businesses as well because it
[01:34:57.960 --> 01:35:00.740]   establishes a precedent which says if you have any kind of user content--
[01:35:00.740 --> 01:35:01.740]   Yelp didn't.
[01:35:01.740 --> 01:35:03.980]   --you are responsible for what people say on your platform.
[01:35:03.980 --> 01:35:05.540]   And nobody wants to be in that position.
[01:35:05.540 --> 01:35:07.540]   Last story is a really reasonable argument.
[01:35:07.540 --> 01:35:08.540]   That was so good.
[01:35:08.540 --> 01:35:09.540]   And that's why I'm going to change the game.
[01:35:09.540 --> 01:35:10.540]   Ballers or something.
[01:35:10.540 --> 01:35:11.540]   Yeah.
[01:35:11.540 --> 01:35:12.540]   You guys are just dead.
[01:35:12.540 --> 01:35:13.540]   It's just-- I don't know.
[01:35:13.540 --> 01:35:14.540]   Yay.
[01:35:14.540 --> 01:35:16.540]   I think I just so teched out.
[01:35:16.540 --> 01:35:17.540]   That's science.
[01:35:17.540 --> 01:35:18.540]   You were here like--
[01:35:18.540 --> 01:35:19.540]   That was like a golf clap.
[01:35:19.540 --> 01:35:21.620]   That was like-- that was literally a golf clap.
[01:35:21.620 --> 01:35:24.660]   Like you just-- you were a comedian and they know you.
[01:35:24.660 --> 01:35:25.660]   You're like their family.
[01:35:25.660 --> 01:35:26.660]   Yeah, and they're like, I don't believe this.
[01:35:26.660 --> 01:35:27.660]   Clap.
[01:35:27.660 --> 01:35:28.660]   Yeah.
[01:35:28.660 --> 01:35:29.660]   I think they get brother-in-law's in the background.
[01:35:29.660 --> 01:35:32.600]   I'd rather just stay silent.
[01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:38.100]   Google's search anthropologist Dan Russell says that 90% of the people in his study do
[01:35:38.100 --> 01:35:44.220]   not know that Control F will use search for the contents of a word in a document or a
[01:35:44.220 --> 01:35:45.220]   web page.
[01:35:45.220 --> 01:35:46.220]   So what--
[01:35:46.220 --> 01:35:47.220]   What percent?
[01:35:47.220 --> 01:35:48.220]   90.
[01:35:48.220 --> 01:35:49.220]   Why--
[01:35:49.220 --> 01:35:50.220]   Is that a new story?
[01:35:50.220 --> 01:35:51.220]   Where--
[01:35:51.220 --> 01:35:52.220]   Yeah, it's on the slash dot.
[01:35:52.220 --> 01:35:54.380]   I think it's relevant because I think we assume--
[01:35:54.380 --> 01:35:55.380]   Yeah.
[01:35:55.380 --> 01:35:56.380]   People know how to use their computers.
[01:35:56.380 --> 01:35:57.380]   Oh, but they absolutely do not.
[01:35:57.380 --> 01:35:58.380]   No, I don't assume.
[01:35:58.380 --> 01:35:59.380]   No, they don't.
[01:35:59.380 --> 01:36:01.820]   I assume like we know how to use that.
[01:36:01.820 --> 01:36:04.100]   This is the problem with privacy on the internet.
[01:36:04.100 --> 01:36:05.100]   I know--
[01:36:05.100 --> 01:36:06.100]   Oh, I'm going to see this dance.
[01:36:06.100 --> 01:36:07.100]   I am so--
[01:36:07.100 --> 01:36:08.100]   Segway, baby.
[01:36:08.100 --> 01:36:10.020]   I have met so many engineers.
[01:36:10.020 --> 01:36:11.020]   Yeah.
[01:36:11.020 --> 01:36:15.940]   Right, from Google, from Microsoft, from Apple that have said that it's a-- on Facebook,
[01:36:15.940 --> 01:36:19.940]   of course, that it is the consumer's responsibility to understand what they're doing on the internet.
[01:36:19.940 --> 01:36:20.940]   No, they don't.

[01:38:40.940 --> 01:38:41.940]   We would love to.
[01:38:41.940 --> 01:38:42.940]   I would love to.
[01:38:42.940 --> 01:38:45.940]   Let's have a day where we're all black.
[01:38:45.940 --> 01:38:46.940]   All right.

[01:38:54.940 --> 01:38:55.940]   It's done.
[01:38:55.940 --> 01:38:56.940]   It's too late.
[01:38:56.940 --> 01:38:57.940]   No, no.
[01:38:57.940 --> 01:38:58.940]   I'd love to do that.
[01:38:58.940 --> 01:38:59.940]   Great.
[01:38:59.940 --> 01:39:00.940]   We love Veritone.
[01:39:00.940 --> 01:39:01.940]   How to be black.
[01:39:01.940 --> 01:39:02.940]   Yeah, in February, who's the publisher?
[01:39:02.940 --> 01:39:03.940]   HarperCollins.
[01:39:03.940 --> 01:39:04.940]   Can't wait to see this.
[01:39:04.940 --> 01:39:05.940]   It's pre-orderable on Amazon already.
[01:39:05.940 --> 01:39:06.940]   So I have an idea for your second book.
[01:39:06.940 --> 01:39:07.940]   Yeah.
[01:39:07.940 --> 01:39:08.940]   How to be white.
[01:39:08.940 --> 01:39:09.940]   I'm totally serious.
[01:39:09.940 --> 01:39:11.940]   You go and you learn how to be white.
[01:39:11.940 --> 01:39:12.940]   It's too far from--
[01:39:12.940 --> 01:39:13.940]   It's a Eddie Murphy schedule.
[01:39:13.940 --> 01:39:14.940]   I have my concept for it.
[01:39:14.940 --> 01:39:15.940]   It's like a really--
[01:39:15.940 --> 01:39:16.940]   Oh, really?
[01:39:16.940 --> 01:39:17.940]   Yeah.
[01:39:17.940 --> 01:39:18.940]   There was white like me.
[01:39:18.940 --> 01:39:19.940]   Yeah.
[01:39:19.940 --> 01:39:20.940]   No, it's good.
[01:39:20.940 --> 01:39:21.940]   Leo, look for it.
[01:39:21.940 --> 01:39:22.940]   I'll talk to you about it after this.
[01:39:22.940 --> 01:39:23.940]   I don't want to take up too much more time, but it's actually--
[01:39:23.940 --> 01:39:24.940]   It might be a good film project.
[01:39:24.940 --> 01:39:25.940]   I love that idea.
[01:39:25.940 --> 01:39:26.940]   That's a great idea.
[01:39:26.940 --> 01:39:27.940]   It's always a pleasure to have you.
[01:39:27.940 --> 01:39:28.940]   We love you.
[01:39:28.940 --> 01:39:29.940]   We love you.
[01:39:29.940 --> 01:39:30.940]   Thank you so much.
[01:39:30.940 --> 01:39:31.940]   Congratulations on this beautiful studio.
[01:39:31.940 --> 01:39:32.940]   Yeah, this is your main deal.
[01:39:32.940 --> 01:39:33.940]   Thank you.
[01:39:33.940 --> 01:39:34.940]   It's actually-- it looked kind of like a circus or roller coaster.
[01:39:34.940 --> 01:39:35.940]   Circus or any roller coaster?
[01:39:35.940 --> 01:39:36.940]   Yeah.
[01:39:36.940 --> 01:39:37.940]   Circus coaster.
[01:39:37.940 --> 01:39:42.940]   Cool.
[01:39:42.940 --> 01:39:44.940]   We were in a tiny little cottage.
[01:39:44.940 --> 01:39:46.940]   The size of that room over there is very--
[01:39:46.940 --> 01:39:47.940]   Where was that?
[01:39:47.940 --> 01:39:48.940]   Down the street.
[01:39:48.940 --> 01:39:49.940]   He was squatting in someone's house.
[01:39:49.940 --> 01:39:50.940]   It was really weird.
[01:39:50.940 --> 01:39:51.940]   We've grown a little bit since.
[01:39:51.940 --> 01:39:53.940]   They finally came downstairs and discovered him.
[01:39:53.940 --> 01:39:55.940]   Paul Therat's been with us since the very beginning.
[01:39:55.940 --> 01:39:58.940]   Windows Weekly is my favorite Windows podcast.
[01:39:58.940 --> 01:40:02.940]   How do you like that?
[01:40:02.940 --> 01:40:04.940]   I love all my children equally.
[01:40:04.940 --> 01:40:06.940]   I'd like to announce my departure.
[01:40:06.940 --> 01:40:10.940]   Now with Mary Jo Foley for more Windows goodness.
[01:40:10.940 --> 01:40:13.940]   You can find his blog at super site for Windows.
[01:40:13.940 --> 01:40:14.940]   That's winsupersite.com.
[01:40:14.940 --> 01:40:17.940]   His books-- there are a lot of them.
[01:40:17.940 --> 01:40:19.940]   The latest is Windows Phone Secrets, but there's Windows 7 Secrets.
[01:40:19.940 --> 01:40:22.940]   And perhaps a Windows 8 secret at some point.
[01:40:22.940 --> 01:40:24.940]   Always a pleasure having you.
[01:40:24.940 --> 01:40:26.940]   Nick Bilton, glad you're in the West Coast now.
[01:40:26.940 --> 01:40:27.940]   We've got to have you on more often.
[01:40:27.940 --> 01:40:28.940]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:40:28.940 --> 01:40:30.940]   Next time, you know, smoke them if you go.
[01:40:30.940 --> 01:40:31.940]   That's okay.
[01:40:31.940 --> 01:40:32.940]   Should I hand out cigars?
[01:40:32.940 --> 01:40:33.940]   We could do that.
[01:40:33.940 --> 01:40:35.940]   Nick writes for the New York Times.
[01:40:35.940 --> 01:40:39.940]   And we'll see you on the bits blog there as well as in the pages.
[01:40:39.940 --> 01:40:40.940]   And Happy Birthday, Nick.
[01:40:40.940 --> 01:40:41.940]   Wait a minute.
[01:40:41.940 --> 01:40:42.940]   This is his birthday?
[01:40:42.940 --> 01:40:43.940]   Yes, it is.
[01:40:43.940 --> 01:40:44.940]   Two days ago.
[01:40:44.940 --> 01:40:45.940]   Oh, well, you got to stick around.
[01:40:45.940 --> 01:40:46.940]   We got a $950 cake for you.
[01:40:46.940 --> 01:40:47.940]   Oh, sweet.
[01:40:47.940 --> 01:40:49.940]   In fact, you could see the original cottage on the cake.
[01:40:49.940 --> 01:40:50.940]   Yeah, perfect.
[01:40:50.940 --> 01:40:52.940]   Thank you very much for getting me a cake for you.
[01:40:52.940 --> 01:40:53.940]   Happy Birthday, Nick.
[01:40:53.940 --> 01:40:54.940]   It's great.
[01:40:54.940 --> 01:40:55.940]   Congratulations.
[01:40:55.940 --> 01:40:56.940]   And we are-- I'm serious.
[01:40:56.940 --> 01:40:57.940]   We're really glad to have you out here.
[01:40:57.940 --> 01:40:58.940]   You look every day of it.
[01:40:58.940 --> 01:40:59.940]   Yeah.
[01:40:59.940 --> 01:41:00.940]   I appreciate it.
[01:41:00.940 --> 01:41:02.940]   Every year's been a hard lived year.
[01:41:02.940 --> 01:41:03.940]   It was a gray hair.
[01:41:03.940 --> 01:41:04.940]   It's a gray hair.
[01:41:04.940 --> 01:41:05.940]   It's a gray hair.
[01:41:05.940 --> 01:41:10.940]   No, I always love having Nick on because he's so tied into the young people.
[01:41:10.940 --> 01:41:11.940]   Oh, that's it?
[01:41:11.940 --> 01:41:12.940]   It was not smart.
[01:41:12.940 --> 01:41:13.940]   The young people.
[01:41:13.940 --> 01:41:16.940]   Oh, he knows how to talk to the kids these days.
[01:41:16.940 --> 01:41:19.940]   They love Nick with his school days.
[01:41:19.940 --> 01:41:21.940]   His wood glasses.
[01:41:21.940 --> 01:41:22.940]   Are those our wood?
[01:41:22.940 --> 01:41:23.940]   Are they actually wood?
[01:41:23.940 --> 01:41:24.940]   That is so cool.
[01:41:24.940 --> 01:41:25.940]   That is so cool.
[01:41:25.940 --> 01:41:29.940]   I feel like I'm in a tutorial splendor here between the thumb hooks and the glass.
[01:41:29.940 --> 01:41:30.940]   Icebreaker, baby.
[01:41:30.940 --> 01:41:31.940]   Icebreaker.
[01:41:31.940 --> 01:41:32.940]   I got my t-shirt.
[01:41:32.940 --> 01:41:33.940]   You're Microsoft Polo.
[01:41:33.940 --> 01:41:34.940]   That's awesome.
[01:41:34.940 --> 01:41:35.940]   Rippin.
[01:41:35.940 --> 01:41:36.940]   Rippin.
[01:41:36.940 --> 01:41:37.940]   Mr. Peter Rojas.

[01:41:40.940 --> 01:41:42.940]   Your partner Ryan Block right behind you there.
[01:41:42.940 --> 01:41:43.940]   They're back.
[01:41:43.940 --> 01:41:44.940]   Yeah.
[01:41:44.940 --> 01:41:46.940]   It's really great to have you on and we'll have you back soon.
[01:41:46.940 --> 01:41:47.940]   Thanks.
[01:41:47.940 --> 01:41:48.940]   Anytime you're in the area, we'd love to have you.
[01:41:48.940 --> 01:41:49.940]   Yeah.
[01:41:49.940 --> 01:41:50.940]   Come on, Ryan.
[01:41:50.940 --> 01:41:51.940]   You can sneak into this shot.
[01:41:51.940 --> 01:41:52.940]   Ryan's just wicked.
[01:41:52.940 --> 01:41:53.940]   Ryan's like--
[01:41:53.940 --> 01:41:54.940]   He's just going to end soon.
[01:41:54.940 --> 01:41:55.940]   Just keep him blurry like that.
[01:41:55.940 --> 01:41:56.940]   Give that man some McCallen.
[01:41:56.940 --> 01:41:57.940]   He looks shady that day.
[01:41:57.940 --> 01:41:58.940]   Yeah.
[01:41:58.940 --> 01:41:59.940]   I don't know if I'd trust him.
[01:41:59.940 --> 01:42:00.940]   F-ed to Rojas.
[01:42:00.940 --> 01:42:01.940]   He doesn't look any like the Peter Rojas.
[01:42:01.940 --> 01:42:02.940]   I know.
[01:42:02.940 --> 01:42:04.940]   Great to have you all.
[01:42:04.940 --> 01:42:08.940]   Great to have you all watching and we're going to have a little bit of a party in a minute
[01:42:08.940 --> 01:42:09.940]   or two to celebrate.
[01:42:09.940 --> 01:42:10.940]   Fett time.
[01:42:10.940 --> 01:42:11.940]   Fett time.
[01:42:11.940 --> 01:42:12.940]   Fett to today.
[01:42:12.940 --> 01:42:14.940]   Fett to today.
[01:42:14.940 --> 01:42:15.940]   But we do invite you to come back.
[01:42:15.940 --> 01:42:17.940]   We do this show every Sunday, 3 p.m.
[01:42:17.940 --> 01:42:20.940]   Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time.
[01:42:20.940 --> 01:42:23.940]   That's 2200 UTC at live.twit.tv.
[01:42:23.940 --> 01:42:27.940]   And you know, if you're in the Northern California area, please do stop by.
[01:42:27.940 --> 01:42:29.940]   We love having people in our live studio audience.
[01:42:29.940 --> 01:42:31.940]   Just email my sister for tickets.
[01:42:31.940 --> 01:42:33.940]   Eva is what's happening.
[01:42:33.940 --> 01:42:34.940]   I know.
[01:42:34.940 --> 01:42:35.940]   Even as it's coming up.
[01:42:35.940 --> 01:42:37.940]   Nothing says big corporation.
[01:42:37.940 --> 01:42:39.940]   Email my sister.
[01:42:39.940 --> 01:42:40.940]   [laughter]
[01:42:40.940 --> 01:42:43.940]   The sad thing is they all know her address.
[01:42:43.940 --> 01:42:45.940]   Eva, just ask my sister.
[01:42:45.940 --> 01:42:47.940]   She'll get you some tickets.
[01:42:47.940 --> 01:42:48.940]   Snooki.
[01:42:48.940 --> 01:42:51.940]   Snooki was on the New York Times bestseller list.
[01:42:51.940 --> 01:42:52.940]   No.
[01:42:52.940 --> 01:42:53.940]   Yeah, anybody can do it.
[01:42:53.940 --> 01:42:54.940]   She tweeted it.
[01:42:54.940 --> 01:42:55.940]   I wrote back.
[01:42:55.940 --> 01:42:57.940]   I said, "Do you even know what the New York Times bestseller list is?"
[01:42:57.940 --> 01:42:58.940]   Oh, that's great.
[01:42:58.940 --> 01:42:59.940]   What is her book?
[01:42:59.940 --> 01:43:01.940]   It's called, "Smooking for Love."
[01:43:01.940 --> 01:43:02.940]   Snooking for love?
[01:43:02.940 --> 01:43:03.940]   I think so.
[01:43:03.940 --> 01:43:08.940]   The fact that I know that, by the way, is called "A Shure Thing."
[01:43:08.940 --> 01:43:09.940]   A Shure Thing.
[01:43:09.940 --> 01:43:11.940]   A Shure Calendar is Snooking for Love.
[01:43:11.940 --> 01:43:13.940]   She's got some cool snooki.
[01:43:13.940 --> 01:43:15.940]   And it's abysmal.
[01:43:15.940 --> 01:43:16.940]   Is it really awful?
[01:43:16.940 --> 01:43:18.940]   Well, I actually got an advance of you now.
[01:43:18.940 --> 01:43:19.940]   I'm surprised because she's so talented.
[01:43:19.940 --> 01:43:21.940]   I got advance copies of all of these books.
[01:43:21.940 --> 01:43:24.940]   And Mike, the situations book, who is also on the show.
[01:43:24.940 --> 01:43:25.940]   How was it?
[01:43:25.940 --> 01:43:27.940]   There's one page that teaches you how to dance.
[01:43:27.940 --> 01:43:29.940]   And he talks about doing the fist bump in the air.
[01:43:29.940 --> 01:43:31.940]   And he's like, "You've got to punch the air.
[01:43:31.940 --> 01:43:33.940]   Like, you're really feeling it."
[01:43:33.940 --> 01:43:35.940]   So, terrible pieces of literature.
[01:43:35.940 --> 01:43:36.940]   Good advice.
[01:43:36.940 --> 01:43:37.940]   Two-shirt times.
[01:43:37.940 --> 01:43:38.940]   Yeah, they're bad.
[01:43:38.940 --> 01:43:39.940]   I love that show.
[01:43:39.940 --> 01:43:40.940]   So, there you go.
[01:43:40.940 --> 01:43:42.940]   Oh, is she have her own website now?
[01:43:42.940 --> 01:43:43.940]   Yeah.
[01:43:43.940 --> 01:43:44.940]   Snooki Pollux.
[01:43:44.940 --> 01:43:45.940]   Snooki Pollux.
[01:43:45.940 --> 01:43:46.940]   Please don't make me look at that.
[01:43:46.940 --> 01:43:48.940]   Are we sending traffic to Snooki?
[01:43:48.940 --> 01:43:49.940]   I think you just, you can't help it.
[01:43:49.940 --> 01:43:50.940]   I don't understand.
[01:43:50.940 --> 01:43:51.940]   This counter is at zero.
[01:43:51.940 --> 01:43:52.940]   What happened?
[01:43:52.940 --> 01:43:53.940]   Something magic?
[01:43:53.940 --> 01:43:54.940]   It's over.
[01:43:54.940 --> 01:43:56.940]   Her 15 minutes.
[01:43:56.940 --> 01:43:57.940]   That's what that was.
[01:43:57.940 --> 01:43:58.940]   It was a 15 minute countdown.
[01:43:58.940 --> 01:44:01.940]   And now it's at zero, so we can stop talking about it.
[01:44:01.940 --> 01:44:02.940]   Hey, thanks, everybody.
[01:44:02.940 --> 01:44:03.940]   We'll see you next time.
[01:44:03.940 --> 01:44:05.940]   Another Twitch is in the can.
[01:44:05.940 --> 01:44:06.940]   It's amazing.
[01:44:07.940 --> 01:44:08.940]   I wanna Twitch.
[01:44:08.940 --> 01:44:09.940]   Do you wanna Twitch?
[01:44:09.940 --> 01:44:10.940]   Alright.
[01:44:10.940 --> 01:44:12.940]   Do you wanna Twitch, baby?
[01:44:12.940 --> 01:44:13.940]   Do you wanna Twitch?
[01:44:13.940 --> 01:44:14.940]   Alright.
[01:44:14.940 --> 01:44:19.940]   [MUSIC]
