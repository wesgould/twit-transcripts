[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.280]   This is Twit, this week in Tech, episode 38 are Macworld Special.
[00:00:05.280 --> 00:00:30.280]   [Music]
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:36.280]   Wow, this is great. We're at the ZeeM, which is an incredible museum, a science museum for kids at
[00:00:36.280 --> 00:00:42.280]   Moscone Center, and we're in the ZeeM Auditorium. Is this a nice facility? I think we might do this on a regular basis.
[00:00:42.280 --> 00:00:49.280]   This is just, yeah, that's great. One guy. We put on a Broadway show. We could dance here. This is fantastic.
[00:00:49.280 --> 00:00:55.280]   We also want to thank the San Francisco School for Digital Filmmaking, who are helping us out with the technical issues here,
[00:00:55.280 --> 00:00:58.280]   because I don't know why. It's so difficult to do this.
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.280]   You're still stuck in the lumbering geeks trying to do a dance ensemble.
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:10.280]   I always want to do a rap kind of, in fact, I want to do this with the Vorac, where we do a keynote where there's smoke bombs in the flashpots
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:12.280]   and we do kind of a rap and we come out.
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:15.280]   We need a lot of dancing women.
[00:01:15.280 --> 00:01:18.280]   Then they take the rockettes.
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:22.280]   The rockettes, exactly. So let me go around the table. We're still waiting for Steve Woznak.
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:30.280]   He did say to come, but we just don't know if he's going to make it. He was in rehearsals all day today for something.
[00:01:30.280 --> 00:01:32.280]   Broadway show.
[00:01:32.280 --> 00:01:37.280]   Broadway show. Yeah, that's going to be great. Roger Chang is on the stage right here.
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.280]   Hello.
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:46.280]   Patrick Norton, good to have you.
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:54.280]   Patrick had to move the taping of DLTV back a little bit, so to accommodate this.
[00:01:54.280 --> 00:01:57.280]   So thank you. I appreciate that because Tuesday is tape night on DLTV.
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:58.280]   Did you get the show in? Yes.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.280]   You're done? Now we're in coding.
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.280]   You got somebody else doing that? We're uploading. Yes.
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:03.280]   I'll be back there on the night.
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.280]   Why did they make your work after five?
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:09.280]   It's Ziff Davis, baby.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:11.280]   John C. Dvorak, who's...
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:19.280]   He's Patrick's designated needler tonight.
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:21.280]   And he's been doing a good job already.
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:22.280]   Thank you.
[00:02:22.280 --> 00:02:23.280]   Yeah, well done.
[00:02:23.280 --> 00:02:28.280]   All the way from Canada, Amber MacArthur is here tonight. We're glad to have her back.
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:36.280]   And to Amber's left, it's Chris Breen from Macworld Magazine, Mac911.
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:38.280]   The Mac Daddy.
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:44.280]   Also the author of the fabulous, what is it, secrets of the iPod and iTunes now, right?
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:48.280]   Yeah, and also the iPod and iTunes pocket guide.
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.280]   Small enough to fit in your pocket?
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.280]   Small enough to fit in your pocket.
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.280]   Just like your iPod.
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:53.280]   That's right.
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:57.280]   And all the way to the left, because we thought Apple was going to announce a plasma HDTV.
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:58.280]   Robert Herron.
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:06.280]   He's the HDTV guy at DLTV.
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:07.280]   Indeed.
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.280]   Yeah.
[00:03:08.280 --> 00:03:12.280]   Did you have anything to do with the PC Magazine cover on the story this month on HDTV reviews?
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:13.280]   I did.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.280]   Mostly my stories.
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.280]   Yeah.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.280]   He's been good stuff.
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:17.280]   Guys going blind watching HDTV.
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:21.280]   And now about a half a dozen more displays sitting in the lab right now while I was gone
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.280]   at CES.
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.280]   It's pretty scary.
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.280]   It's going to be a busy year.
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.280]   So it was a very, I think a very exciting keynote. It was kind of like a rock show.
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:33.280]   Really? I mean, you didn't go, John. Who was at the keynote?
[00:03:33.280 --> 00:03:36.280]   I just got the thing, you know, I did smart money.
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:37.280]   That's not the same.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.280]   The MacRumorsLive.com thing is a minute by minute breakdown works for me.
[00:03:42.280 --> 00:03:45.280]   And you know, that's every bit as good as being in there.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.280]   Yeah, it is.
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:51.280]   Well, come on. It's an Apple keynote, which means there's going to be a pause at every
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:52.280]   announcement.
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:53.280]   Yes.
[00:03:53.280 --> 00:03:56.280]   There's going to be a huge number of basically engineers and Mac employees in the back to
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:04:00.280]   make sure if there's no clapping and clapping starts at the back and moves it way forward.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.280]   They take the journalists and they bury them in the middle or off to the sides of their
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:05.280]   surrounded by enthusiastic people.
[00:04:05.280 --> 00:04:06.280]   They're brilliantly managed.
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.280]   Oh, you think you're so smart.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:09.280]   The Apple people were in front this time.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:10.280]   You know?
[00:04:10.280 --> 00:04:11.280]   They were all over.
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:14.280]   I think it was ever seen those old Betty Boop cartoons.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:18.280]   But the audience is that they show typically with a Betty Boop cartoon with everyone clapping
[00:04:18.280 --> 00:04:20.280]   and jumping up and down hippopotamuses and whatever.
[00:04:20.280 --> 00:04:22.280]   It's pretty much the same thing.
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:24.280]   So there was a hippopotamus?
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:25.280]   It is in his contract.
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.280]   There was a couple of hippopotamuses.
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:27.280]   In A22.
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.280]   Yeah.
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.280]   Except Steve was kind of down today.
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:31.280]   I think he was actually sick.
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:32.280]   You think he was down?
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.280]   No, I think he was sick.
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:34.280]   He was slow.
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.280]   He kept referring to his notes, which kind of surprised me.
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:37.280]   He's usually got that stuff.
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.280]   He misspoke a couple of times and that is not like Steve.
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.280]   Yeah.
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:46.280]   I mean, if Steve could clone himself, he would have fired himself for the first time.
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:53.280]   But I have to say that the anticipation, in stark contrast to the keynotes at CES, which
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:57.280]   really really does, the anticipation beforehand, the excitement, people were running.
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:00.280]   They had the Ushers saying, "Slow down, you're all going to get in."
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:02.280]   People were running to get in.
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:05.280]   It felt like a festival seating in an Aerosmith concert.
[00:05:05.280 --> 00:05:06.280]   Yeah.
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:07.280]   Let's get in there.
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:08.280]   Yeah, that's very typical.
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.520]   You know, actually, if you've seen a lot of Steve Jobs' keynotes, you kind of noticed
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:15.280]   that he most of the time is like, "Hey, we got great stuff to show you today."
[00:05:15.280 --> 00:05:17.280]   He was a little down.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.280]   We have some more interesting things to do.
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:21.280]   And he coughed a few times.
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.280]   Yeah.
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:27.280]   And I thought there was some good stuff announced today, but he really wasn't kind of delivering
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.280]   that.
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.280]   This is incredible.
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.280]   And look at this and look at this.
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:32.520]   And I don't think it was because of the nature of the products, but rather, I think he was
[00:05:32.520 --> 00:05:34.280]   sort of feeling under the weather.
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:35.280]   Well, that's kind of--
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:37.280]   He was afraid of being hugged by Odellini again.
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:39.280]   Well, that's why he had that suit on.
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.280]   We're going to get to the Odellini thing because I think there was a major faux pas that happened
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:45.920]   there with Intel, but I'm also very interested in the Intel-Apple relationship because it's
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:47.480]   not exactly what I would have thought.
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.800]   But we're going to get to that.
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:52.280]   Let's start at the beginning and work our way item by item, please.
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.280]   Through John's room.
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:05:54.280]   Sorry, I got this.
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.280]   No, it's now.
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:57.280]   Couple of--okay, first of all.
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:05:59.880]   People here, I'll start 8.55.
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.280]   People are taking their seats.
[00:06:01.280 --> 00:06:02.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:02.280 --> 00:06:07.280]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:08.280]   And the crowd's going wild.
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:09.280]   Look at that.
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.280]   This is unbelievable.
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.280]   Now, let's talk about some of the numbers because he did announce some spectacular sales figures.
[00:06:14.280 --> 00:06:17.280]   A hundred sold every minute through the quarter.
[00:06:17.280 --> 00:06:19.280]   42 million iPods sold since it was first for these 30 million--
[00:06:19.280 --> 00:06:20.280]   40--
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:23.280]   --and then the past quarter, they sold what over--
[00:06:23.280 --> 00:06:24.280]   14 million.
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:25.280]   14.
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.280]   Well, 4.5 during the holiday.
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:27.280]   No, no, no.
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:28.280]   14.
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:29.280]   You're blowing Steve's meat.
[00:06:29.280 --> 00:06:30.280]   14 million iPods in the 2005 holidays.
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:31.280]   That's not--
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:33.280]   It's 4.5 in holiday 2004.
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.280]   14 million for holidays.
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:35.280]   That's right.
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:37.280]   See, that's what Steve got a big-- a lot of--
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:38.280]   I don't have to take notes anymore.
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:39.280]   This is so cool.
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:41.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:41.280 --> 00:06:42.280]   John's in a journalist--
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:43.280]   Thanks, thank you, guys.
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.280]   --fantasy guy.
[00:06:44.280 --> 00:06:45.280]   Mac Roomer's life for doing this for me.
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:46.280]   But that's-- wait a minute.
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:49.280]   14 million iPods sold-- and all of them, by the way, video iPods, right?
[00:06:49.280 --> 00:06:51.280]   Oh, except for the Nanos and the Shuffles.
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:52.280]   But a lot of video--
[00:06:52.280 --> 00:06:54.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:57.280]   Did they not give breakdowns by item?
[00:06:57.280 --> 00:06:59.280]   They didn't give-- but that means a lot of video iPods.
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:02.280]   The 42 million iPods out there is pretty stunning.
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:05.280]   Also, what were some of the other numbers?
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.280]   He said--
[00:07:06.280 --> 00:07:07.280]   The 83% market share?
[00:07:07.280 --> 00:07:08.280]   They had a huge quarter.
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:10.280]   Yeah, 850 million songs.
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.280]   8 million videos in the iTunes musical--
[00:07:12.280 --> 00:07:16.280]   There'll be a billion songs in about a month and a half, about six weeks.
[00:07:16.280 --> 00:07:19.280]   You know, that stuff doesn't knock me out.
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:21.280]   I think what's amazing is how many iPods they've sold.
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:27.280]   Discuss-- at 9.18 AM, he discussed the Jeep Dodge iPod integration.
[00:07:27.280 --> 00:07:28.280]   That's right.
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:31.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.280]   That gives-- see, the problem with that list is it's not--
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:36.280]   There's no-- there's no content.
[00:07:36.280 --> 00:07:37.280]   There's no wait to it.
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.280]   He didn't spend a long time.
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:40.280]   Yeah, but most people just want facts, facts, facts.
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:41.280]   All right, give us some facts.
[00:07:41.280 --> 00:07:42.280]   More facts.
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:44.280]   Well, I think that's about it.
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:45.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:45.280 --> 00:07:47.280]   Nothing else to announce.
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.280]   It's, you know, the rest of its applause and--
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:50.280]   I don't see this worth it.
[00:07:50.280 --> 00:07:51.280]   All right.
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:57.280]   He did show the software-- OK, let's talk about iLife06, because I think that there was some neat stuff in that.
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.280]   Including the ability to podcast directly from GarageBand.
[00:08:00.280 --> 00:08:01.280]   Yeah, that's really cool.
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:09.280]   You press a button and it's a podcast, upload it to the app iTunes Music Store, and what Amber and I realized is we sat there doing a podcast and, of course, they shut us down.
[00:08:09.280 --> 00:08:10.280]   We got in trouble.
[00:08:10.280 --> 00:08:11.280]   Oops.
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.280]   What did you do?
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:17.280]   Well, if that's for me, I'm done in about an hour.
[00:08:17.280 --> 00:08:18.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:22.280]   We went over to the-- we started playing with the new iMac, which is, by the way.
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:23.280]   Well, wait, we haven't got to that yet.
[00:08:23.280 --> 00:08:24.280]   They don't know about it.
[00:08:24.280 --> 00:08:25.280]   I just--
[00:08:25.280 --> 00:08:26.280]   Can't you--
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:30.280]   What happened to talking about what some of the highlights were that, as you saw them?
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.280]   Let's go to the iLife thing.
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.280]   All right.
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:34.280]   You want to talk about it on a lini list?
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:35.280]   You're all over the map.
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:36.280]   Well, actually, hold on.
[00:08:36.280 --> 00:08:37.280]   Stop.
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:39.280]   You guys want to hear about the iMac?
[00:08:39.280 --> 00:08:41.280]   John bought me wine and plied me with liquor.
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:42.280]   I feel like--
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:44.280]   I'm half in glass.
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:45.280]   I'm lupped.
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.280]   We had call for a lini.
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.280]   I'm legally drunk.
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:48.280]   So--
[00:08:48.280 --> 00:08:49.280]   It is for the lini thing.
[00:08:49.280 --> 00:08:50.280]   OK.
[00:08:50.280 --> 00:08:52.280]   I want a lini at exactly 10-10.
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.280]   First of all--
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:54.280]   First of all--
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:56.280]   No, not all the lini.
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:57.280]   Some smoke comes out.
[00:08:57.280 --> 00:08:58.280]   Right.
[00:08:58.280 --> 00:08:59.280]   And a guy in a bunny suit appears.
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:00.280]   1009.
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:01.280]   A guy in a bunny--
[00:09:01.280 --> 00:09:04.280]   If you're going to do this with a whole show, I'm going to have to take that away from you.
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:05.280]   You want the detail.
[00:09:05.280 --> 00:09:06.280]   Through the whole--
[00:09:06.280 --> 00:09:08.280]   The guy comes out in a bunny suit.
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:09.280]   And you don't know who it is.
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:11.280]   And he's carrying a big chip.
[00:09:11.280 --> 00:09:15.280]   He practically gets down on his knees to Steve and says, "Here, we are delivering you the chip."
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:17.280]   [laughter]
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:19.280]   And then he takes off his hat.
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:23.280]   Now, I knew it was Paul on the lini, but at no point did anybody say, "This is the chairman of India."
[00:09:23.280 --> 00:09:25.280]   This is the chairman of Intel Corporation here.
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:28.280]   It could have been some guy from LaFab.
[00:09:28.280 --> 00:09:33.280]   And they never-- and Steve didn't say, "Ladies, gentlemen, Paul and a lini from Intel, did you see anything, Chris Breen?
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:34.280]   Did they see Gee?
[00:09:34.280 --> 00:09:37.280]   They said Paul with a lini on the screen.
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:38.280]   Oh, I must have missed it.
[00:09:38.280 --> 00:09:39.280]   They did say that?
[00:09:39.280 --> 00:09:40.280]   Yeah.
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:41.280]   Oh, well, never mind.
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:42.280]   There goes the story.
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:43.280]   Sorry.
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:46.280]   Well, no, it doesn't-- because I mean, at the end they say goodbye Paul.
[00:09:46.280 --> 00:09:48.280]   And then that's when I figured out it was some guy named Paul.
[00:09:48.280 --> 00:09:49.280]   Yeah.
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.280]   It was Paul McCartney.
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:52.280]   Oh, McCartney.
[00:09:52.280 --> 00:09:55.280]   Maybe Leo has the feeling that he was stiffed.
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.280]   I thought he was stiff, but now I see that.
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:09:58.280]   It sounds like he was too.
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.280]   He wasn't if they put it up on the screen.
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.280]   No, they put it up on the screen.
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:01.280]   There was no hug.
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:02.280]   There was no hug.
[00:10:02.280 --> 00:10:03.280]   There was no hug.
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:04.280]   There was no hug.
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:05.280]   And they hugged before.
[00:10:05.280 --> 00:10:10.280]   So the last time they had only knee up there was kind of the brotherly, very male hug.
[00:10:10.280 --> 00:10:11.280]   Oh, so then--
[00:10:11.280 --> 00:10:12.280]   [laughter]
[00:10:12.280 --> 00:10:16.280]   But, well, I come down here, sir, and I be happy.
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:17.280]   [laughter]
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:18.280]   Kind of up.
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:20.280]   [laughter]
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:22.280]   [applause]
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:26.280]   Well, for anyone listening to the podcast, that was disgusting.
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.280]   Yeah, there's-- you had to catch it on the video.
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:32.280]   No, you kind of need a 45 degree angle to make that okay.
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:37.280]   And also, again, I think Steve was sick, and so it only had the suit on.
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.280]   And he didn't--
[00:10:38.280 --> 00:10:39.280]   Oh, that's the bunny suit.
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:40.280]   I think that was it.
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:44.280]   You know, he said, you know, Paul-- he said to Paul, "Look, I'm not feeling my best."
[00:10:44.280 --> 00:10:47.280]   And it only said, "Look, you know, I'm having a hard enough time to do this."
[00:10:47.280 --> 00:10:50.280]   You know, I'm having a hard enough time, kind of, this relationship to begin with.
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:51.280]   You know, I don't think so.
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:52.280]   I'm expecting to be, sir.
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:57.280]   This was the kind of-- I thought the subtext of the whole thing was that Intel was surprisingly--
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:58.280]   Dossa.
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:10:59.280]   Dossa.
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:04.280]   I thought that they really acted like-- in fact, they allowed-- I don't know how this happened--
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:09.280]   Apple to do an ad that essentially said the Intel chip has been trapped inside of PCs all this time.
[00:11:09.280 --> 00:11:11.280]   Finally, it's free.
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:12.280]   Yes.
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:13.280]   That's the ad.
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:14.280]   No, no, I do see--
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.280]   I do see--
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.280]   I mean, surprisingly so.
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:20.280]   And if I were Bill Gates, I'd be a little bit miffed.
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:22.280]   No, well, Bill Gates has been working.
[00:11:22.280 --> 00:11:29.280]   Bill Gates and basically, Microsoft and Intel have been in odds for five or six years.
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.280]   That's where I--
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:31.280]   Well, actually longer than that.
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:32.280]   And this is apparent.
[00:11:32.280 --> 00:11:33.280]   This was-- I mean, this wasn't--
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:37.280]   I've ever since the Windows hardware developers' conference and the Intel developer for a split
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:42.280]   and started promoting whatever version that Intel thought the hardware industry should go versus whatever
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:43.280]   correction--
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:48.280]   So is this the honeymoon phase, or do you think that there really is going to be a love match between
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:49.280]   Intel and Apple?
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:54.280]   I think it's just maneuvering for best position, just depending on, you know.
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:57.280]   Hey, Bill decides to flip this switch and say screw you guys.
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:58.280]   Right.
[00:11:58.280 --> 00:12:03.280]   We got IBM and they've managed to manufacture a bunch of power PCs for our software.
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:05.280]   Granted, it's in a game console, but--
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:06.280]   Right.
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:07.280]   I think it's a situation--
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:11.280]   Wouldn't that be funny if Windows suddenly went over to the power PC side?
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.280]   Well, they did with the Xbox.
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:14.280]   The Xbox, yeah.
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:18.280]   But I think, essentially, you're just dealing with a vendor who's dealing with the typical
[00:12:18.280 --> 00:12:24.280]   Silicon Valley semiconductor company, and these guys tend to be kind of crummy to each other.
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:28.280]   They're mean, and I think you're going to see a fight take place, and I think within--
[00:12:28.280 --> 00:12:29.280]   In the long run.
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:30.280]   Here's the-- you know, everyone comes to--
[00:12:30.280 --> 00:12:33.280]   You know, everyone comes to-- you've been predicting this Intel thing forever.
[00:12:33.280 --> 00:12:35.280]   And so I'm going to predict something new.
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:39.280]   I think that Apple's going to switch to AMD within two and a half years.
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.280]   Yay.
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:44.280]   Well, if AMD can deliver a mobile part.
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:47.280]   Well, you know, that's the only missing piece of the puzzle with AMD.
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:48.280]   There's no mobile part.
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:49.280]   So right now there's no--
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.280]   It's an okay mobile part, not a great one.
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:52.280]   Not as good as Intel's.
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:54.280]   So let's jump to the chase then.
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:13:00.280]   I mean, obviously, the Apple announced a new laptop, the Mac Core Book Duo, whatever that book.
[00:13:00.280 --> 00:13:01.280]   Mac Book Pro.
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:02.280]   The Power Weiz.
[00:13:02.280 --> 00:13:03.280]   The Power Weiz.
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.280]   Core dual.
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:05.280]   What is the name of it?
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:06.280]   Mac Book Pro.
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:07.280]   Whoa.
[00:13:07.280 --> 00:13:08.280]   Yeah.
[00:13:08.280 --> 00:13:11.280]   Not the worst name you ever heard the Mac Book Pro?
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:12.280]   Yeah.
[00:13:12.280 --> 00:13:13.280]   The Pro Book.
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:17.280]   Why don't they just call it a Macintosh laptop?
[00:13:17.280 --> 00:13:22.480]   Anyway, so the Mac Book Pro, which I still can't remember the name of, but which is a pretty
[00:13:22.480 --> 00:13:27.280]   impressive product, and the new iMac, which is kind of depressing me because here's this
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:32.280]   cheap 1299 computer that's faster than my dual G5 tower.
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:33.280]   Oops.
[00:13:33.280 --> 00:13:35.280]   I mean, it's depressing.
[00:13:35.280 --> 00:13:37.280]   I mean, we went over and played with it, and were nice to play.
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:38.280]   It's really fast.
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:41.280]   The new iMacs, you can always get it by this weekend.
[00:13:41.280 --> 00:13:43.280]   But I want you to buy one because the price will be like $200.
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:44.280]   Oh, I will.
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:45.280]   I'll buy it.
[00:13:45.280 --> 00:13:46.280]   Yeah.
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:47.280]   That's it.
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:51.280]   You get one time you bought one of those cubes, and they continue to the next day.
[00:13:51.280 --> 00:13:53.280]   The day, same day I bought it.
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:13:54.280]   They just continue.
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.280]   I got home and they just continue.
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:57.280]   You know, they just waited for you to put out your credit card.
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:58.280]   They did.
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:14:01.280]   But no, Alex Lindsey and I are sitting, watching the keynote, and we practically, we were
[00:14:01.280 --> 00:14:05.280]   ready to vault over the chairs and run to the Apple Store, and then he says, but not the
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:07.280]   power, the Mac power.
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:12.120]   Macbook Pro Pro Corduo won't be available until February.
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:13.120]   So I was disappointed.
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:14.120]   But I think I'll probably buy one of those.
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:15.120]   I'm going to get one for sure.
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:16.120]   They look great.
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.120]   They're beautiful.
[00:14:17.120 --> 00:14:18.120]   Chris Brady.
[00:14:18.120 --> 00:14:20.280]   Who's got the cash to buy a $2,000 notebook?
[00:14:20.280 --> 00:14:22.200]   Oh, they come on.
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:23.200]   That's nothing.
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:24.640]   You're not going to wait for the revision fee.
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:25.800]   Well, that's the question.
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:26.800]   Should we?
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:27.800]   Yes.
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:28.800]   I would.
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:29.800]   I'm assuming everything else is going to happen.
[00:14:29.800 --> 00:14:30.800]   He's got the right idea.
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:31.800]   I'm not going to wait now.
[00:14:31.800 --> 00:14:32.800]   This is their first Intel product I wouldn't take.
[00:14:32.800 --> 00:14:35.200]   I'm certainly going to pimp my employer for one.
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:36.200]   Yeah.
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:37.320]   I think-- look, they are.
[00:14:37.320 --> 00:14:38.320]   I am not kidding.
[00:14:38.320 --> 00:14:40.320]   They are spectacularly faster.
[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:41.320]   I mean, this is--
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:45.880]   Buy the three-year warranty.
[00:14:45.880 --> 00:14:49.560]   And remember, don't ever throw it away because when it breaks, they'll release the
[00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:51.920]   fix and the recall after you throw it off.
[00:14:51.920 --> 00:14:52.920]   That happened to me with the iBook.
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:54.240]   Yeah, I know what you're talking about.
[00:14:54.240 --> 00:14:55.760]   You don't have to look at me like that.
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:58.400]   You don't have to rub it in.
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.400]   This is the notebook.
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:02.000]   Yeah, the voice of notebooks passed.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:08.320]   Well, I mean, I have to say, the speed of this, the first thing it makes me think is Apple's
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:12.400]   been lying to us about the G5 all this time.
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:16.120]   Wait, wait.
[00:15:16.120 --> 00:15:17.880]   We've been telling you that for like three years.
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:18.880]   Like the ad.
[00:15:18.880 --> 00:15:21.640]   This is the fastest computer in the world.
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:22.640]   It's so powerful.
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:28.560]   My favorite ad was the snail with the Intel chip glued on the back of that one.
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:31.520]   Yeah, they're going to live to regret that one.
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:33.520]   I mean, it's probably faster.
[00:15:33.520 --> 00:15:37.920]   So you actually, what applications are you running and how is that for the parent?
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:41.200]   Well, first of all, you've got to run the native apps, which means anything with OS10
[00:15:41.200 --> 00:15:43.280]   is all native now.
[00:15:43.280 --> 00:15:45.920]   Noticeably faster launch times.
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:49.880]   Launch iPhoto, the sample machines they had on the table there had 6,000 photos.
[00:15:49.880 --> 00:15:55.520]   Now, if you've ever used iPhoto with 6,000 photos, go and take a break because you can't
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:56.920]   do anything with it.
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:01.840]   This thing, I made the thumbnails as small as possible scroll through the entire thing
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:02.840]   like that.
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:03.840]   Like butter?
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:04.840]   Like butter.
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:06.840]   That's Steve.
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:09.040]   Steve was sick because he coined that phrase.
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:10.040]   That scrolls like butter.
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:11.040]   I know it.
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:13.640]   That exactly does that scroll.
[00:16:13.640 --> 00:16:15.640]   Steve must have been under the weather because that was like.
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:16.640]   That was odd.
[00:16:16.640 --> 00:16:18.640]   It was like last time going crazy.
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:20.640]   I think Steve was on a single one.
[00:16:20.640 --> 00:16:21.640]   He was on a single one.
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:22.640]   He went to the table and went to get it.
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:23.640]   What did I just say?
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:24.640]   Pretty gross.
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:25.880]   He was in another world.
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:26.880]   Yeah.
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:29.000]   Like sprulls like butter.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   Firewire is in there, but Firewire 800 is not in the laptop.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:33.920]   Yeah, they pulled that out.
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:41.040]   So, they do have PCI Express in the laptop, which is good news because that, I guess,
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:42.240]   is that on the PC card?
[00:16:42.240 --> 00:16:44.760]   Hey, someday it'll be a PCI Express mini card.
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:45.760]   Yeah.
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:47.720]   I guess that's good news.
[00:16:47.720 --> 00:16:48.720]   Maybe.
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:49.720]   I don't know.
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:53.560]   There's only one fire fire 400 port though.
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:56.760]   I mean, it is a little bit stripped down in that respect.
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:58.760]   FM tuner on the iPod.
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:16:59.760]   Final.
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:05.120]   I carry around an iPod so I don't have to listen to the crappy radio and say, "I agree.
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:06.120]   I agree.
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:07.120]   I agree."
[00:17:07.120 --> 00:17:13.160]   Except for Pirate Cat Radio 87.9, please FCC, don't kill them.
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.160]   SNL skits.
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.160]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.160]   Yeah.
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:17.160]   Sure.
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:18.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:20.120]   We should get all that in there.
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:21.120]   Okay.
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:23.920]   So, in the iTunes store now, you can buy Saturday Night Live.
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:24.920]   Old stuff.
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:25.920]   Yeah.
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:28.960]   The whole presentation I kept thinking of the Steve Jobs spoof from Saturday Night Live
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:29.960]   at the beginning.
[00:17:29.960 --> 00:17:30.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:31.960]   That was cool.
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:32.960]   I couldn't get that out of my head at the beginning.
[00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:33.960]   I kept thinking he was joking with all of the numbers.
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:34.960]   The iPod Pecanio.
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:35.960]   I know.
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:38.400]   I wish I could erase that for my mind.
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.200]   Do you think that'll be for sale?
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:41.200]   Or will Steve Bannon?
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:42.200]   I thought he was going to show it.
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.200]   I think it should be.
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.200]   I've still done a bunch of Apple movies.
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:50.640]   The best one I like is where they make the I-Note, which is essentially a digital version
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:51.640]   of a Post-it note.
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:56.240]   But they come in the same size stats and you have to leave each one individually when
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:59.280]   you're done, you throw it away.
[00:17:59.280 --> 00:18:01.360]   Everybody at the end of these things always says, "Well, what did you think of this thing?
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:02.360]   What was it like?"
[00:18:02.360 --> 00:18:05.520]   And I thought this was a very nutritious sort of keynote.
[00:18:05.520 --> 00:18:06.760]   It's stuff that's good for you.
[00:18:06.760 --> 00:18:10.440]   Well, what I mean is, I mean, there's like a lot of good protein and carbohydrates in
[00:18:10.440 --> 00:18:11.920]   there, but not a lot of sugar.
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:15.120]   So like there was no new iPod, which is like glittering, but it was, "Oh, that is so
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:16.120]   great."
[00:18:16.120 --> 00:18:17.120]   Like, it does this.
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:18.120]   It lights up and it does that.
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:20.480]   And this was all stuff that needed to be done.
[00:18:20.480 --> 00:18:22.480]   We all knew about the Intel transition.
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:23.480]   Okay, good.
[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:25.000]   Now we've got some Intel machines.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   That's good.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.000]   We've done that.
[00:18:27.000 --> 00:18:30.160]   I-Life 06 was necessary and expected.
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:31.640]   We all knew that was going to be coming along.
[00:18:31.640 --> 00:18:33.000]   So, okay, here it is.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:38.400]   And every so often, every four keynotes maybe, jobs kind of delivers on what needs to be
[00:18:38.400 --> 00:18:39.400]   done.
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:42.440]   This wasn't particularly flashy, but it was a good solid.
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:43.440]   I don't know.
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:44.440]   I thought it was really cool.
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:46.440]   I mean, I think these Intel iMacs are...
[00:18:46.440 --> 00:18:47.440]   And I was an Asaier.
[00:18:47.440 --> 00:18:49.920]   I mean, you had a talk me down.
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:50.920]   I was on a ledge.
[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:53.000]   Yeah, you were bad.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:54.920]   It's all over.
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:57.280]   And now maybe I've swung too far the other way.
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:58.280]   Maybe I'm not a polar.
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:18:59.280]   You are.
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:01.960]   Or a dry polar, perhaps.
[00:19:01.960 --> 00:19:02.960]   Many, many people.
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:05.080]   Yeah, you may have swung too far.
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:06.080]   I think it's...
[00:19:06.080 --> 00:19:09.960]   Look, at I said Rosetta, the emulation, that's going to be a pig.
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:12.720]   Even word runs very nicely on these in emulation.
[00:19:12.720 --> 00:19:16.320]   Because you need that speed to operate or...
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:17.320]   Well, it's not challenging.
[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:18.320]   I just...
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:20.440]   It felt like a much faster computer.
[00:19:20.440 --> 00:19:26.640]   Safari, look, Safari, let's face it, has always been the Achilles heel of the Macintosh.
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.600]   People switched to Mac and say, "But what's with the browser?
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:29.600]   It's so slow."
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:32.160]   It's because they didn't use Internet Explorer back in the day.
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:34.680]   Well, even Firefox is slow.
[00:19:34.680 --> 00:19:36.200]   Because the apples just are not.
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:40.880]   No, nothing's fast on a Mac, except now, actually Safari is sneaky.
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:41.880]   He means browsers.
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:44.080]   The rest of the stuff is really fast.
[00:19:44.080 --> 00:19:45.880]   Why is it the browsers were slow on the Mac?
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:46.880]   Don't understand that.
[00:19:46.880 --> 00:19:47.880]   Tell me.
[00:19:47.880 --> 00:19:48.880]   Ask him.
[00:19:48.880 --> 00:19:49.880]   Ask him.
[00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:50.880]   Why?
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:51.880]   I have no clue.
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:53.560]   He has no clue.
[00:19:53.560 --> 00:19:54.560]   Bad processors.
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:19:56.560]   Yeah, I think so.
[00:19:56.560 --> 00:19:57.560]   Bad processors.
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:02.160]   That's what I took away from the entire thing was that these are all upgrades that were necessary
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:04.280]   to get them up to speed with everything we wanted to piece.
[00:20:04.280 --> 00:20:05.280]   We weren't competitive.
[00:20:05.280 --> 00:20:06.280]   We were not competitive yet.
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:07.280]   It's really simple.
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:10.200]   We were in a superior operating system and cleaner applications.
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:12.200]   But they were running on bad hardware.
[00:20:12.200 --> 00:20:13.200]   Right.
[00:20:13.200 --> 00:20:14.200]   Yeah.
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:15.200]   Bad hardware.
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:16.200]   They should be here.
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:17.440]   They've been playing with Dolcorne now for what?
[00:20:17.440 --> 00:20:18.440]   Two years.
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:19.440]   And there's so many.
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:23.480]   But now we're finally starting to see the software, which is really a good time for Apple
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:25.040]   to jump into it.
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:28.520]   Now the developers are actually taking advantage of it for A, the new consoles for gaming.
[00:20:28.520 --> 00:20:32.200]   But on top of that, it's also just all the other applications that can be ported over,
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:33.200]   like encoding.
[00:20:33.200 --> 00:20:34.440]   I can't wait to see.
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:36.400]   Well, that's important to me.
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:39.840]   No, no, I'm totally with that.
[00:20:39.840 --> 00:20:41.280]   Chris Breen, aren't you jumping up and down?
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:42.880]   Does this make you in any way excited?
[00:20:42.880 --> 00:20:44.520]   You write for a Macintosh magazine.
[00:20:44.520 --> 00:20:45.880]   Please help me out here.
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:47.680]   It's like an editor.
[00:20:47.680 --> 00:20:48.680]   Yes.
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:50.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:51.480]   You can--
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:52.480]   No, I am.
[00:20:52.480 --> 00:20:57.640]   But I kind of-- I've been to enough Steve Jobs keynotes that I'm all-- I always walk
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.480]   out going, that sounds really, really good.
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:00.720]   And there was no nano there.
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:02.480]   There was nothing there that would just make you--
[00:21:02.480 --> 00:21:03.480]   Thank God.
[00:21:03.480 --> 00:21:05.240]   --thank God there was no new iPod.
[00:21:05.240 --> 00:21:06.240]   He's seen enough of it.
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:08.200]   He's tried to rub in my book.
[00:21:08.200 --> 00:21:11.440]   No, I am excited about the stuff that Apple's doing.
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:12.440]   It all looked really good.
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:13.440]   It just needed to be.
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.400]   But I need to have hands-on time with it.
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:18.440]   And then I can kind of verify where the problem is.
[00:21:18.440 --> 00:21:24.720]   And just like Patrick, I am concerned about any time they do a major hardware shift that
[00:21:24.720 --> 00:21:29.560]   I want to make sure that I'm not the first in line to get one of these things.
[00:21:29.560 --> 00:21:32.040]   And people ask me, is it time to buy a new Mac?
[00:21:32.040 --> 00:21:33.320]   I wait a couple of months.
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:35.720]   How many people here pre-ordered?
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:36.720]   Nobody.
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:37.720]   One guy.
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:38.720]   Two.
[00:21:38.720 --> 00:21:39.720]   Two.
[00:21:39.720 --> 00:21:40.720]   Wow.
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:43.000]   How many of you would have pre-ordered if you were at home?
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   Same two.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:46.160]   It's not-- you know, that's interesting.
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:48.000]   I think there are a lot of people like you who are just sitting back.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   You're going to be better by two people.
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:51.320]   How many of you don't care because your window's useless?
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:52.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:54.320]   You're a very brave man, sir.
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:55.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:56.680]   Yeah, so it all looks good.
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:57.880]   You know, on paper it looks great.
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:58.880]   But--
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:21:59.880]   Say again?
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:00.880]   Did you get it wrong really?
[00:22:00.880 --> 00:22:01.880]   Mm.
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:04.320]   It was very hot on the bottom if you picked it up.
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:06.160]   But then that's how I like my laptops.
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:07.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:22:07.160 --> 00:22:09.320]   Ladies and gentlemen, Andy Walker!
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:10.320]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:18.320]   Ladies and gentlemen, Ricky Gervais, the star of the BBC's office.
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:19.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:22:19.320 --> 00:22:20.920]   So it's good to see you, Andy.
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:22.280]   You came down with Sean Carruthers.
[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:23.680]   They're the Lab Rats.
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:24.680]   Lab Rats.tv?
[00:22:24.680 --> 00:22:25.680]   Lab Rats.tv?
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:26.680]   Lab Rats.tv?
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:29.800]   You did 34,000 downloads yesterday.
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:31.280]   Yesterday for your CES stuff?
[00:22:31.280 --> 00:22:32.280]   CES coverage.
[00:22:32.280 --> 00:22:33.280]   That's awesome.
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:34.280]   Congratulations.
[00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:35.280]   That's a really great show.
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:36.280]   You guys are doing a great job.
[00:22:36.280 --> 00:22:40.200]   Andy, of course, our former co-host on Call for Health until Amber filed a suit.
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.200]   I understand you guys are going to--
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:44.920]   That is not true, by the way.
[00:22:44.920 --> 00:22:45.920]   Not true.
[00:22:45.920 --> 00:22:46.920]   I didn't have a question, though, Leah.
[00:22:46.920 --> 00:22:47.920]   Yes.
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:54.760]   My question is, did you notice that in the entire keynote, there was time slices of stage
[00:22:54.760 --> 00:22:56.400]   occupation.
[00:22:56.400 --> 00:22:57.920]   So of course, Steve had most of it.
[00:22:57.920 --> 00:22:58.920]   Right.
[00:22:58.920 --> 00:23:02.200]   O'Lenie had about 30 seconds with his little suit and his puff of smoke there.
[00:23:02.200 --> 00:23:03.760]   I felt bad for Paul, Leah.
[00:23:03.760 --> 00:23:04.760]   I thought that was a humiliating--
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:06.760]   It was hugely humiliating.
[00:23:06.760 --> 00:23:07.760]   But I noticed that Microsoft--
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:10.760]   So everyone feels when dealing with Apple.
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:12.480]   It's a great question.
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.480]   Sorry.
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:15.200]   But Microsoft got a huge chunk of time.
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.600]   They did, and she wasn't very good.
[00:23:16.600 --> 00:23:18.080]   And she was awful.
[00:23:18.080 --> 00:23:19.080]   Roshoe.
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:20.080]   Is she in the audience?
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:21.080]   No, she's not.
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:24.000]   So I wondered what you guys thought, what you made of that.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:26.960]   The Microsoft got top billing, basically second banana.
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:27.960]   I think you're right.
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:33.440]   I think what it is, is Microsoft, Apple, Intel, Microsoft, Apple has to beg Microsoft
[00:23:33.440 --> 00:23:34.440]   to keep doing office.
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:38.080]   And that's essentially what Roshoe was there to say is, yes, we--
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:39.920]   What was your name?
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:42.280]   Roshoe.
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:48.920]   That's why I said it again, John, that Roshoe said was--
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:49.920]   What was that, Leah?
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:50.920]   Roshoe.
[00:23:50.920 --> 00:23:51.920]   Say it, Leah.
[00:23:51.920 --> 00:23:52.920]   Make fun of it.
[00:23:52.920 --> 00:23:53.920]   I just asked what it was.
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:55.400]   He just wanted to know what it was.
[00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:59.960]   The poor woman her whole life has been, unless she married into it, in which case, she should
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:01.600]   never have taken his name.
[00:24:01.600 --> 00:24:02.600]   Not.
[00:24:02.600 --> 00:24:09.520]   Anyway, moving on before the lawsuits.
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:12.440]   This is why the screensavers is no longer on the air.
[00:24:12.440 --> 00:24:14.760]   Can you finish your story, Leo?
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:16.440]   I forgot what I was talking about.
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:21.680]   No, I thought that what it looked like to me was Paul O'Dolini, and I think you're exactly
[00:24:21.680 --> 00:24:25.040]   right, and he is where you're going, was kind of in this humiliating brief.
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:27.720]   Here's the chairman of Intel in a bunny suit.
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:29.200]   And a bunny smoke.
[00:24:29.200 --> 00:24:30.200]   And smoke.
[00:24:30.200 --> 00:24:31.920]   And he's like, here, we bring you the chips.
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:36.200]   Meanwhile, jobs is in exactly the same position with Microsoft saying, and now Microsoft's
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:40.680]   going to take over and bore you for 10 minutes with corporate speak because we so desperately
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:41.680]   need office.
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:43.480]   I think that's exactly what you saw.
[00:24:43.480 --> 00:24:44.480]   I saw that too.
[00:24:44.480 --> 00:24:49.480]   I'm somewhat stunned by the fact that over all these years, that office has been dominating
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:52.560]   the Mac and the office environment, that somebody hasn't--
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:54.560]   Come up with an alternative?
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:55.560]   That--
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:24:56.560]   That--
[00:24:56.560 --> 00:24:57.560]   That--
[00:24:57.560 --> 00:24:58.560]   Nice, isn't it?
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:24:59.560]   Nice, it still exists.
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:00.560]   It's great.
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:03.360]   Background in a skunk works in some secret way.
[00:25:03.360 --> 00:25:07.400]   Built, something that they could just-- all of a sudden just, well, we broke up with Microsoft
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:08.400]   and here's the new thing.
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.800]   And they've rolled out a big product.
[00:25:10.800 --> 00:25:14.040]   They've had years and years and years to do this.
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:18.480]   Well, that's always been the speculation that Apple is building a spreadsheet program.
[00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:21.000]   And I think you'll saw a little bit of it in keynote, which now does--
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   It's called iWork.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   iWork.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   Which got 15 seconds on it.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   Right, I saw it.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:26.000]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   I work.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:28.000]   It's like this big, this big of slice.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:34.920]   You can't even mention pages, which is their word processor.
[00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:38.360]   It's almost as if they were embarrassed, oh, yeah, we have a word processor, but really
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:40.000]   word is what you should be using.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.160]   This all began when they dumped Apple Basic.
[00:25:43.160 --> 00:25:45.560]   No, you know what?
[00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:46.560]   This is actually--
[00:25:46.560 --> 00:25:49.160]   The solution is to bring that basic on Mac Basic.
[00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:52.560]   Yeah, that's exactly what I'm saying.
[00:25:52.560 --> 00:25:55.080]   No, no, no, this is actually, I think you're exactly right.
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:58.960]   This is a stork story that only a man as old as John would remember.
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:02.560]   Well, I'm doing a good thing.
[00:26:02.560 --> 00:26:05.520]   But it actually is a telling story.
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:09.120]   Apple developed the most incredible basic called Mac Basic.
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:10.120]   Mac Basic.
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:12.120]   It was an amazing basic.
[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:13.120]   And yeah.
[00:26:13.120 --> 00:26:16.120]   I came up with this thing called Mac Basic.
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:17.120]   How did you--
[00:26:17.120 --> 00:26:19.120]   And what happened to it old timer?
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:20.120]   I don't remember.
[00:26:20.120 --> 00:26:22.720]   It just darned disappeared.
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:24.560]   No, Microsoft killed it.
[00:26:24.560 --> 00:26:25.560]   Yes, they did.
[00:26:25.560 --> 00:26:27.440]   Bill Gates made a call to Steve Jobs and said, if you ship--
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:28.600]   Wasn't it scully as a goat?
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:29.600]   It was scully.
[00:26:29.600 --> 00:26:30.880]   If you ship that product--
[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:31.880]   Sugar water boy.
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:32.880]   Your toast.
[00:26:32.880 --> 00:26:33.880]   Your toast.
[00:26:33.880 --> 00:26:34.880]   And they pulled it.
[00:26:34.880 --> 00:26:35.880]   And actually it leaked out.
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:38.480]   I used to distribute it on my bulletin board system.
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:39.840]   And it was just a-- it was very slick.
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:41.480]   Yeah, I'll give you the number later.
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:43.840]   Actually, I probably still remember.
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:44.840]   Bit torrent.
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:46.320]   Two modems, 1,200 BPS.
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:47.400]   No waiting.
[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:50.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:53.880]   And not one, but two 20 megabyte drives.
[00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:58.760]   So I think that that's exactly what's happened.
[00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:00.600]   Even since then, that was 20 years ago.
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:01.480]   Apple still.
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:03.440]   There may have been some sort of a deal we don't know about
[00:27:03.440 --> 00:27:06.080]   that was signed in blood that--
[00:27:06.080 --> 00:27:07.640]   In midnight at the crossroads?
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:09.680]   I mean, it was possible that there was some contractual
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:12.000]   obligation that was fulfilled, especially--
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.680]   maybe when Gates did the $150 million deal or something.
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:16.680]   And that is how--
[00:27:16.680 --> 00:27:18.160]   But something took place, which is the only reason I believe--
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:20.720]   And that's why they trivialized the iWork thing
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:23.800]   at this presentation, I think, or marginalized
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:24.760]   it, because I think there's some--
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:27.320]   I think there's like a deal in the backgrounds.
[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.720]   And then the woman specifically said they're going to at least
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:31.120]   keep this thing going for five years.
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:33.000]   That's probably when the contract runs out.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:33.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:34.200]   She said that number, exactly.
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:35.000]   She gave a number.
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.240]   I mean, why would she say that?
[00:27:36.240 --> 00:27:37.200]   What, like five years?
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.280]   Why say anything?
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:38.720]   Right.
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:39.640]   So when you start hearing--
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:41.400]   Well, because it's the digital decade.
[00:27:41.400 --> 00:27:43.000]   Yeah, right.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:44.160]   It's the digital decade.
[00:27:44.160 --> 00:27:48.000]   You know, the great-- they did show one new feature in keynote.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:49.200]   It's got wood.
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:51.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:55.200]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:58.000]   Did anybody but me see the Google booth at the show?
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:27:59.760]   Yes, there was nobody there.
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:00.360]   We don't be there.
[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:02.760]   It was a little bit dinky booth in the back in the corner.
[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:03.640]   Is this big?
[00:28:03.640 --> 00:28:04.400]   And nobody was there.
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:06.440]   And the Google people were in the speakers room.
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:07.520]   And we said, why are you in here?
[00:28:07.520 --> 00:28:10.200]   They said, every time we go out there, they say, mob us.
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:11.560]   They said they got swarmed.
[00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:12.920]   She came back in.
[00:28:12.920 --> 00:28:14.600]   For bed, you come to a trade show.
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:17.280]   And people actually ask you a question, so you ditch them.
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:18.920]   They had a bigger booth.
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:19.400]   They had a big--
[00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:20.560]   Google is a strange company.
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:22.320]   They had a bigger booth at Podcast Expo.
[00:28:22.320 --> 00:28:23.800]   Can you see the keynote at CES?
[00:28:23.800 --> 00:28:24.440]   I heard it was--
[00:28:24.440 --> 00:28:25.880]   OK, I saw it before, cheaper.
[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:26.600]   Yeah.
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:27.440]   Well, tell me about that.
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:29.840]   Everybody was saying it was a terrible boring keynote.
[00:28:29.840 --> 00:28:32.360]   It totally brought out Robin Williams.
[00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:33.040]   It was awful.
[00:28:33.040 --> 00:28:36.280]   They actually cut the feed for the Robin Williams part
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:37.400]   because I was recording it.
[00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:39.280]   Because he also got wood out here.
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:40.440]   [CHEERING]
[00:28:40.440 --> 00:28:41.440]   All right.
[00:28:41.440 --> 00:28:43.400]   He said a few dozen things that probably
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:45.600]   wouldn't make it in polite company very well.
[00:28:45.600 --> 00:28:46.960]   But it was extremely funny.
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:50.080]   He managed to insult the three different people
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:50.920]   from three different--
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:53.320]   oh, actually from three different countries.
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:56.640]   He made weird references to German automobiles.
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:28:57.120]   Yeah.
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:58.840]   It was just bad.
[00:28:58.840 --> 00:29:00.920]   There's got to be a bootleg of it floating around.
[00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:01.480]   Maybe.
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:02.920]   I have the portion of the--
[00:29:02.920 --> 00:29:04.560]   Anybody has a bootleg of it?
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:08.880]   Give it a send it to me and I'll blog it at the vorac.org/blog.
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:10.080]   And there he is.
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:14.480]   Ladies and gentlemen, the first plug.
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:16.000]   Somebody sent me an email, said there's
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:17.840]   a new Twit drinking game.
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:20.000]   And every time the Vorac matches his blog--
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:20.800]   you take a drink--
[00:29:20.800 --> 00:29:22.600]   I wonder if that's the right from the screen saver
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:24.440]   drinking game.
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:25.560]   That's right.
[00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:28.160]   There was a screen saver's drinking game, wasn't there?
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:28.680]   Yes.
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:29.520]   It was.
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:31.240]   Do you remember what the rules were?
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:32.360]   Let's not go into this.
[00:29:32.360 --> 00:29:37.400]   Every time I plug my book, I think you took a drink.
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:40.600]   Oh, well, the guys would be splashed.
[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:44.160]   So they just call it the Leo plugging his book show.
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:48.640]   Have I plugged my book once in this podcast in Twit ever?
[00:29:48.640 --> 00:29:49.200]   You just did.
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:51.600]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:29:51.600 --> 00:29:54.000]   Leo, I didn't know you had a book.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:54.920]   I don't have a book.
[00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:56.440]   It's all right.
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:56.880]   That's all right.
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:58.280]   I go on Regis to plug that.
[00:29:58.280 --> 00:29:59.600]   I don't need to do it on my podcast.
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:01.440]   There was a new product from Adobe as well.
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:02.680]   I can't remember the name of it.
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:04.200]   It was called Salivate, I think.
[00:30:04.200 --> 00:30:05.200]   No.
[00:30:05.200 --> 00:30:05.720]   What was it?
[00:30:05.720 --> 00:30:07.360]   Dark but not dark but--
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:07.760]   Lightroom.
[00:30:07.760 --> 00:30:10.000]   It was an aperture competitor, yes?
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   Yes.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:11.480]   What's that?
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:14.960]   What's that all about?
[00:30:14.960 --> 00:30:18.400]   So did anybody get to see the product called IC?
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:19.400]   Oh, I did.
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:20.840]   I thought it's CES, and I really like it.
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:21.360]   What is it?
[00:30:21.360 --> 00:30:22.360]   That's pretty cool.
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:28.800]   Essentially, it's essentially $199 video player.
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:29.800]   Kind of--
[00:30:29.800 --> 00:30:30.640]   $300.
[00:30:30.640 --> 00:30:31.720]   No, it's $250.
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:33.480]   But it's-- I'm saying what--
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:34.480]   I'm $275.
[00:30:34.480 --> 00:30:38.360]   It dropped its sold for $299.
[00:30:38.360 --> 00:30:40.800]   So at CES, it was like $279 to $499.
[00:30:40.800 --> 00:30:42.280]   No, it was $250 here.
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:45.800]   But it seems to me that you can get these for $200
[00:30:45.800 --> 00:30:48.360]   if you look around there's a million from China.
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:50.160]   But the fact is this has no hard disk,
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:53.760]   and you take an old defunct iPod, one of the old ones,
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:55.600]   and you shove it in there, and you use that as the hard disk,
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:57.520]   and it becomes like this cool video recorder.
[00:30:57.520 --> 00:31:00.000]   You can record-- it's like an MPEG-4 recorder.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:02.240]   3.6 inch screen, four hours of battery life.
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:03.160]   It uses your--
[00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:03.640]   And uses--
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:05.160]   It has a camera in it.
[00:31:05.160 --> 00:31:05.640]   No.
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:06.160]   No.
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:06.680]   So let's say it says--
[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:07.520]   It's a DVR.
[00:31:07.520 --> 00:31:08.480]   It's a handheld--
[00:31:08.480 --> 00:31:09.800]   Mobile Tivo.
[00:31:09.800 --> 00:31:10.800]   No.
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:12.480]   It's a mobile Tivo.
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:12.840]   No, no, no, no.
[00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:15.280]   It can record video, but they didn't have any--
[00:31:15.280 --> 00:31:16.260]   No, it's got no
[00:31:16.260 --> 00:31:17.600]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:19.200]   It's more like a mobile VCR.
[00:31:19.200 --> 00:31:19.800]   It's for--
[00:31:19.800 --> 00:31:22.040]   I can take an old iPod and do an iPod video.
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:23.440]   You can take an old junker.
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:25.640]   You get your iPod, because everyone who buys these iPods,
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:27.000]   they buy the newest one.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:27.880]   And they got these old--
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:29.040]   I got a ton of them, yeah.
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:30.160]   You just shove it in here, and now you've
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:31.600]   got a nice little video device.
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:32.160]   It's pretty cool.
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:34.320]   You have to use a 4G or a 5G, so you
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:36.520]   can't go back to the 3G or anything earlier than that.
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:37.040]   So it's--
[00:31:37.040 --> 00:31:37.720]   Yeah, it's a--
[00:31:37.720 --> 00:31:39.640]   And how do you get video on to it?
[00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:40.800]   Well, can you use their--
[00:31:40.800 --> 00:31:41.640]   --tunes?
[00:31:41.640 --> 00:31:42.140]   No.
[00:31:42.140 --> 00:31:44.000]   You have to use their proprietary software,
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   and the first release will be--
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   Oh, the
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.040]   very core right from the VCR, you can take it.
[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:48.080]   It also has an audio--
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:49.560]   video in and audio in.
[00:31:49.560 --> 00:31:50.520]   Dongles.
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:51.200]   Basically, you can--
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:52.800]   I see.
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:53.760]   Oh, he's got one.
[00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:54.000]   Oh, no.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.840]   He's just got a piece of paper with a picture of one.
[00:31:55.840 --> 00:31:56.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:31:58.720]   By the way, that's just as good.
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:00.960]   That one's only $49.99.
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:02.960]   If you have any other questions, just come down here.
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:04.560]   I thought it was a good idea for people
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:08.000]   who have these old iPods, and they want to recycle them.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:09.520]   And actually, the interface is very nice.
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:12.000]   A couple of people from Apple, the old Apple Day,
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.920]   it's one of the original Mac developers,
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:16.080]   is the software engineer behind the thing.
[00:32:16.080 --> 00:32:18.360]   And it really has a nice graphical interface.
[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:19.360]   It does video.
[00:32:19.360 --> 00:32:20.360]   It does audio.
[00:32:20.360 --> 00:32:21.360]   It does photos.
[00:32:21.360 --> 00:32:24.760]   It's got a bigger, brighter screen than the iPod photo.
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:26.800]   $250.
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:29.520]   It's kind of a nice way to use that old iPod.
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:30.960]   And it's a little expensive.
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:32.080]   It shouldn't be that high.
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:34.000]   It should be $150, to be honest about it.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:35.600]   Well, yeah, I've been looking for something--
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:38.280]   for the iPod video for, like, my daughter.
[00:32:38.280 --> 00:32:42.160]   So instead of having to get a full-fledged portable DVD
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:44.320]   that I can put in the car, which is like a dumb monitor
[00:32:44.320 --> 00:32:46.840]   that I can plug my iPod for video back there and say,
[00:32:46.840 --> 00:32:48.120]   here, do this.
[00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:49.200]   It's perfect for that.
[00:32:49.200 --> 00:32:51.320]   Yeah, because you've got tons of video on these things anyway.
[00:32:51.320 --> 00:32:52.360]   So you might as well use it.
[00:32:52.360 --> 00:32:54.280]   So this is close, but not quite.
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:56.240]   Was it like a portable player with the seven or nine-inch
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:32:58.400]   screens out of the question?
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:32:59.160]   Not for most--
[00:32:59.160 --> 00:33:00.160]   Not yet.
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:01.160]   Did anybody--
[00:33:01.160 --> 00:33:02.160]   Did anybody--
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:02.680]   Not much money.
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:04.760]   Was anybody baffled by the fact that Hall D--
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:07.600]   Normally, Maxwell has the two Hall's.
[00:33:07.600 --> 00:33:10.000]   Hall D is usually filled with all kinds of cool little gadgets.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.080]   That was closed.
[00:33:11.080 --> 00:33:12.760]   They had one Hall, period.
[00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:15.080]   Yeah, and that makes sense after the last couple of years,
[00:33:15.080 --> 00:33:17.040]   because they've been doing the two Hall thing,
[00:33:17.040 --> 00:33:20.400]   and increasingly, they're these black curtains everywhere.
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.040]   And you sort of wander around in the other Hall,
[00:33:22.040 --> 00:33:24.600]   and it's going, well, there isn't really that much here.
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:26.840]   And I think this adds a little more excitement
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:28.960]   to the show that everything's packed together.
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:30.160]   There are no curtains anywhere.
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:32.280]   It's all in one place.
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:34.680]   There are 300 vendors, I guess, which is--
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:35.880]   I'm not sure how that compares to this.
[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:37.200]   Is that more or you don't know?
[00:33:37.200 --> 00:33:38.400]   I guess at 2,500.
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:39.440]   So slightly smaller.
[00:33:39.440 --> 00:33:42.200]   Yeah, but to CES have this--
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:43.200]   Yeah, you've--
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:44.760]   I mean, this is a podcast, Leo.
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:46.800]   You can't even do any of these jokes.
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:48.400]   Somebody gave me this.
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:49.920]   I'm wandering around.
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:52.040]   Power supports the name of the company.
[00:33:52.040 --> 00:33:55.840]   It's a little key chain size screen cleaner.
[00:33:55.840 --> 00:33:56.400]   I'm not kidding.
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:57.080]   This is-- go ahead.
[00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:58.400]   Cleaner-- it's perfect for your camera phone.
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:33:59.360]   It's at half a postage stamp.
[00:33:59.360 --> 00:34:00.040]   Oh, it's cool.
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:00.560]   Well, this is--
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:01.560]   This is like--
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:02.560]   Scrape your screen.
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:02.560]   Yeah.
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:04.400]   It's got like some sort of a fiber--
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:05.400]   fiber--
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:07.000]   Yeah, just don't get the metal on there
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:08.720]   because you'll scratch the--
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:09.320]   Moher.
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:10.160]   Moher.
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:11.760]   It's a little piece of Moher.
[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:12.960]   That is a question.
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:14.800]   We have a question from the audience.
[00:34:14.800 --> 00:34:18.360]   Yeah, I was just going to comment and ask about the keynote.
[00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:20.800]   I agree with you that it was--
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:21.920]   updates had to be done.
[00:34:21.920 --> 00:34:25.800]   But for the MacBook, everybody wants the portability.
[00:34:25.800 --> 00:34:28.800]   And the main thing I thought about in it was the battery.
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:30.540]   Well, it's going to have, I think, better battery.
[00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:31.540]   Life, yes.
[00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:32.540]   Well, you've got to think it.
[00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:35.360]   The top end is 1440 by 900.
[00:34:35.360 --> 00:34:36.360]   It's got a 1.8--
[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:37.360]   And a brighter screen.
[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:38.360]   They said it's brighter--
[00:34:38.360 --> 00:34:39.360]   It's a similar display.
[00:34:39.360 --> 00:34:40.360]   --is a lighter screen, brighter than the 30 inch.
[00:34:40.360 --> 00:34:43.560]   You can get 100 gigabyte, 7200 RPM drive in it.
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:45.000]   I thought it was a '52.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.560]   No, it is '54, but they have.
[00:34:46.560 --> 00:34:47.560]   You can order it.
[00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:50.360]   You can get a 100 at 72, and then you can also get a 120
[00:34:50.360 --> 00:34:51.960]   at 5, 5,400.
[00:34:51.960 --> 00:34:52.960]   Right.
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:54.520]   How's that thing going to even last?
[00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:55.880]   Well, that's the whole point.
[00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:56.920]   The higher power--
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:57.920]   Right.
[00:34:57.920 --> 00:34:58.920]   --moher--
[00:34:58.920 --> 00:34:59.920]   --wire--
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:01.660]   --of the V-Ray program.
[00:35:01.660 --> 00:35:02.660]   Yeah.
[00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:03.660]   How's the battery going to last all of your cells?
[00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:05.420]   Well, nobody's saying anything about batteries.
[00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:06.620]   No, it's not posted anywhere.
[00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:07.620]   That's the thing.
[00:35:07.620 --> 00:35:08.620]   Gasoline powered.
[00:35:08.620 --> 00:35:09.620]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:35:09.620 --> 00:35:11.620]   You make a good point, because they probably
[00:35:11.620 --> 00:35:14.020]   would have been touting the battery life had it been improved
[00:35:14.020 --> 00:35:15.020]   battery life.
[00:35:15.020 --> 00:35:16.020]   Exactly.
[00:35:16.020 --> 00:35:17.020]   What was the weight on the--
[00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:18.020]   I thought maybe you would have 5.9--
[00:35:18.020 --> 00:35:19.020]   No, I had 5 at that.
[00:35:19.020 --> 00:35:20.020]   It's probably life.
[00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:21.020]   It's going to--
[00:35:21.020 --> 00:35:22.020]   --firely light.
[00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:23.020]   You call that fairly light.
[00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:27.300]   It's a 60 watt performance hour battery.
[00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:30.200]   They had a description on it, but it never gave the time.
[00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:31.200]   I think you might be right.
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:33.200]   The fact that they left that out may be significant.
[00:35:33.200 --> 00:35:34.240]   Also, John, thanks.
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:37.400]   I typed that up for Arnold Kim for MacRumors today.
[00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:38.400]   Oh.
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:39.400]   This is your transcript.
[00:35:39.400 --> 00:35:40.400]   You did good work.
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:41.400]   Give it a round of applause.
[00:35:41.400 --> 00:35:42.400]   What's your name?
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:43.400]   What's your name?
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:44.400]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:45.400]   What's your name?
[00:35:45.400 --> 00:35:46.400]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:48.400]   Rob Masson from Penn State University.
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:49.400]   There you go.
[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:50.400]   Did you have to look at your badge?
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:51.400]   Did you do that?
[00:35:51.400 --> 00:35:52.400]   I'm wondering.
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:53.400]   Yeah.
[00:35:53.400 --> 00:35:54.400]   It looked at his badge to find his name.
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:57.000]   I used a 15 inch power book with a Verizon card, and he had
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.500]   another guy on the phone, but I had an iChat room going with my buddy's badge.
[00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:02.900]   So you're using EVDO, and that worked pretty well?
[00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:03.900]   Yeah.
[00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:04.900]   No drops at all.
[00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:07.900]   Did you notice that they kept showing Al Gore in the audience?
[00:36:07.900 --> 00:36:08.900]   During the keynote.
[00:36:08.900 --> 00:36:09.900]   During the keynote.
[00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:10.900]   Yeah.
[00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:11.900]   They kept showing Al Gore in the audience.
[00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:15.000]   And then Gavin Newsom, the mayor of San Francisco, goes up to him and shakes hands, and then
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.300]   they kind of almost posed for the camera up there.
[00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:19.300]   We'll be at each other's throat in the eight years.
[00:36:19.300 --> 00:36:20.300]   Yeah.
[00:36:20.300 --> 00:36:21.300]   It's interesting.
[00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:23.900]   Well, isn't Al Gore doing a television station or something?
[00:36:23.900 --> 00:36:24.900]   Yeah.
[00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:25.900]   What's the name of that?
[00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:26.900]   Current.
[00:36:26.900 --> 00:36:27.900]   Have you ever seen that?
[00:36:27.900 --> 00:36:30.100]   I've watched some of this stuff.
[00:36:30.100 --> 00:36:31.100]   It's dreadful, isn't it?
[00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:32.900]   I don't know how he watched TV.
[00:36:32.900 --> 00:36:33.900]   Three minutes.
[00:36:33.900 --> 00:36:38.800]   It's an idea that we had a tech TV briefly.
[00:36:38.800 --> 00:36:39.800]   He still described it that way.
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:41.000]   Oh, there he is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   Al Gore is in.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:44.600]   Hey, where is Al?
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:46.200]   How come he wasn't doing the show with us?
[00:36:46.200 --> 00:36:49.000]   I almost ran up to him, but then there was this barricade.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.700]   Hey, Belkin had a good product.
[00:36:50.700 --> 00:36:51.700]   What was that?
[00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:56.300]   Can I just fill an audience with this one?
[00:36:56.300 --> 00:36:58.660]   I can just get big laughs for anything.
[00:36:58.660 --> 00:36:59.500]   They had a cool--
[00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:01.100]   Sorry, I guess he is Belkin.
[00:37:01.100 --> 00:37:02.100]   No, Belkin.
[00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:03.100]   Belkin, Belkin.
[00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:04.100]   Belkin's got some pretty cool stuff.
[00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:09.500]   They had a U, or an ultra wide band, USB lash up.
[00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:10.500]   And you saw it?
[00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:11.500]   Yeah.
[00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:12.500]   What did you think?
[00:37:12.500 --> 00:37:13.500]   It's awesome.
[00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:14.500]   There you go.
[00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:15.500]   How long before it ships?
[00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:17.700]   No, it'll be shipping right now.
[00:37:17.700 --> 00:37:18.700]   But basically what it does--
[00:37:18.700 --> 00:37:19.700]   Tell us what it does.
[00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:20.700]   It's essentially--
[00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:21.900]   It's pretty much a point to point thing.
[00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:25.940]   But if you have your printer and you stick the little antenna in there and then you
[00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:30.140]   get this little ultra wide band thing and you can just be 10 meters away and it'll
[00:37:30.140 --> 00:37:32.060]   just zoom it over there.
[00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:34.740]   Full 400 megabits per second right to the--
[00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:36.140]   It's wireless USB.
[00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:37.940]   It's wireless USB is what it is, exactly.
[00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:39.340]   Reading about speeds twice.
[00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:42.140]   I've been talking about wireless speeds and then by second quarter--
[00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:43.140]   I know what you're saying.
[00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:44.340]   I agree with you and theory.
[00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:46.900]   But the Belkin people have been doing pretty good work recently.
[00:37:46.900 --> 00:37:50.540]   But the second quarter of this year, they're supposed to have ultra wide band for distributing
[00:37:50.540 --> 00:37:52.540]   HD video as well.
[00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:53.740]   This is one that does that.
[00:37:53.740 --> 00:37:54.740]   That's the other four--
[00:37:54.740 --> 00:37:55.740]   HD.
[00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:57.620]   Yeah, they were showing an HD feed.
[00:37:57.620 --> 00:37:59.140]   They're claiming to do HD.
[00:37:59.140 --> 00:38:00.140]   How much is it?
[00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:01.140]   $5,000.
[00:38:01.140 --> 00:38:02.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:38:02.140 --> 00:38:04.340]   No, I think it's like 200 bucks or--
[00:38:04.340 --> 00:38:05.340]   125.
[00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:06.340]   Wow, that's great.
[00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:07.340]   That's great.
[00:38:07.340 --> 00:38:09.140]   Airport Express, what?
[00:38:09.140 --> 00:38:10.140]   125.
[00:38:10.140 --> 00:38:11.740]   Yeah, this is a different situation.
[00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:14.740]   This is a ultra wide band doesn't have a lot of range.
[00:38:14.740 --> 00:38:17.740]   So you say the question and I'll speak into the microphone.
[00:38:17.740 --> 00:38:21.740]   It's an $9 ethernet card, can't offer the cable or maybe a wireless.
[00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:22.740]   Zen egg.
[00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:23.740]   Yes, I am acidic.
[00:38:23.740 --> 00:38:25.540]   Thank you for fewer cables.
[00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:28.540]   OK, here's the one I was looking for.
[00:38:28.540 --> 00:38:29.540]   Frugal.
[00:38:29.540 --> 00:38:31.540]   What's your name, sir?
[00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:33.540]   I'll get it.
[00:38:33.540 --> 00:38:35.340]   What about running windows on these machines?
[00:38:35.340 --> 00:38:36.940]   Nobody's talked about that.
[00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:41.420]   And Apple said they won't stop you from running windows on it.
[00:38:41.420 --> 00:38:42.420]   It uses a different BIOS.
[00:38:42.420 --> 00:38:46.580]   It doesn't use a standard BIOS, it uses EFI, which is the Intel new standard for modular
[00:38:46.580 --> 00:38:47.580]   BIOS.
[00:38:47.580 --> 00:38:51.340]   You have to write some drivers, but it's apparently doable.
[00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:52.340]   So you'd have to write drivers for it.
[00:38:52.340 --> 00:38:55.140]   Who would want to do it?
[00:38:55.140 --> 00:38:57.140]   I think somebody's going to want to do a boot machine.
[00:38:57.140 --> 00:38:58.140]   OK, yeah, that probably went.
[00:38:58.140 --> 00:38:59.140]   Maybe Linux, whether or not.
[00:38:59.140 --> 00:39:01.140]   There's stupid people in every walk of life.
[00:39:01.140 --> 00:39:02.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:02.140 --> 00:39:03.140]   Ooh.
[00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:04.140]   Ooh.
[00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:05.140]   Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[00:39:05.140 --> 00:39:08.540]   I may be carrying this, but it's not because I particularly want to.
[00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:10.140]   So get off my ass about the thing.
[00:39:10.140 --> 00:39:11.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:13.140]   And it'll happen.
[00:39:13.140 --> 00:39:14.140]   It'll happen.
[00:39:14.140 --> 00:39:15.140]   If it isn't going to happen.
[00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:17.140]   This is called playing to the audience.
[00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:18.140]   It'll be happening in the next two weeks.
[00:39:18.140 --> 00:39:19.140]   Exactly.
[00:39:19.140 --> 00:39:20.140]   You do just this.
[00:39:20.140 --> 00:39:21.140]   Moi?
[00:39:21.140 --> 00:39:22.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:24.140]   Yeah, it'll happen very quickly.
[00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:28.140]   I don't think you guys were at the very end after the show was over, at the keynote was
[00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:29.140]   over.
[00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:33.140]   Steve Jobs walked out of the auditorium with Andy Grove.
[00:39:33.140 --> 00:39:35.140]   And went outside beside talking--
[00:39:35.140 --> 00:39:36.140]   Really?
[00:39:36.140 --> 00:39:37.140]   Andy Grove.
[00:39:37.140 --> 00:39:38.140]   Yeah, Andy Grove was there.
[00:39:38.140 --> 00:39:39.140]   And they went out together.
[00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:41.140]   Paul Linney, unfortunately, was a couple of steps behind.
[00:39:41.140 --> 00:39:42.140]   In his bunny suit?
[00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:43.140]   No.
[00:39:43.140 --> 00:39:44.140]   That was embarrassing.
[00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:47.140]   Did they go on to the back and exchange souls?
[00:39:47.140 --> 00:39:48.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:51.140]   I can play the blues!
[00:39:51.140 --> 00:39:53.140]   John, you're assuming they have souls?
[00:39:53.140 --> 00:39:54.140]   Ah.
[00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:55.140]   Good point.
[00:39:55.140 --> 00:39:56.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:57.140]   You got me on that one.
[00:39:57.140 --> 00:40:01.140]   Andy Grove's chairman of Meredith's, but he doesn't have any roll of it anymore.
[00:40:01.140 --> 00:40:03.140]   Oh, I'm sure he has no suede until whatsoever.
[00:40:03.140 --> 00:40:04.140]   All right.
[00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:05.140]   All right.
[00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:06.140]   He's probably just there to get it.
[00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:07.140]   He has a face of making.
[00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:08.140]   He has a face of making.
[00:40:08.140 --> 00:40:10.140]   Well, I think it will run when it does.
[00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:15.140]   I'm going to say it will run it, and I think it will do it with the sort of unspoken blessing
[00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:17.140]   of both Microsoft and Apple.
[00:40:17.140 --> 00:40:18.140]   Yeah, you know what?
[00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:19.140]   There'll be something missing.
[00:40:19.140 --> 00:40:21.140]   There'll be like a key that you have to have, and it won't have it.
[00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:25.140]   I mean, there'll be some-- I guarantee there's a gotcha if they try to run Windows on that
[00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:26.140]   thing.
[00:40:26.140 --> 00:40:27.140]   Well, I think they can certainly release it.
[00:40:27.140 --> 00:40:28.140]   No, I think it just be the way Apple is.
[00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:29.140]   I don't think it would even be intentional.
[00:40:29.140 --> 00:40:30.140]   They don't have to be intentional.
[00:40:30.140 --> 00:40:31.140]   These things just happen.
[00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:32.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:40:32.140 --> 00:40:33.140]   Well, why not?
[00:40:33.140 --> 00:40:35.140]   I mean, why not make it work with Windows?
[00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:40.140]   Because they sell more than apps because people are tired of running lousy PC laptops.
[00:40:40.140 --> 00:40:42.140]   Well, they want a dependable laptop.
[00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:48.140]   You can run both operating systems and Windows nearly natively because you look at virtual
[00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:50.140]   PC, they can write this thing very close to the hardware.
[00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:54.140]   So instead of getting lousy virtual PC speeds, you're getting real Windows speeds.
[00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:59.140]   If I'm working in a-- currently, if I have a Mac at home and a PC at the office, and I
[00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:03.140]   have the opportunity to get one machine that runs both real well, why not?
[00:41:03.140 --> 00:41:07.140]   In fact, I thought that was kind of the key-- like the brilliant part of the strategy was
[00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:10.140]   that Apple would become one of the top flight windows.
[00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:12.140]   Yeah, no, I think that's absolutely the case.
[00:41:12.140 --> 00:41:17.140]   I think there'll be the premium machine eventually running both the operating systems.
[00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:19.140]   So why didn't Steve address it?
[00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:23.140]   I think he's going to start-- I think that's down the road.
[00:41:23.140 --> 00:41:25.140]   Does he feel like he's stepping into the dark side maybe?
[00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:27.140]   I think it was with the fan base that's out there.
[00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:30.140]   It's nice to intel the developers' cop for six months.
[00:41:30.140 --> 00:41:32.140]   Yeah, it was the five-year deal.
[00:41:32.140 --> 00:41:33.140]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:41:33.140 --> 00:41:35.140]   As soon as that's over, boom, things change.
[00:41:35.140 --> 00:41:36.140]   No, it's good for Microsoft.
[00:41:36.140 --> 00:41:37.140]   It sells copies.
[00:41:37.140 --> 00:41:38.140]   Why would Microsoft not want it?
[00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:39.140]   I mean, that's a good thing.
[00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:41.140]   It sells copies of Windows, right?
[00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:43.140]   No, this is Microsoft, though.
[00:41:43.140 --> 00:41:44.140]   I guess.
[00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:46.140]   They make more money off of office, don't they?
[00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:48.140]   They make a lot of money off of office for me.
[00:41:48.140 --> 00:41:49.140]   You know that kind of stuff?
[00:41:49.140 --> 00:41:50.140]   Yeah, definitely.
[00:41:50.140 --> 00:41:51.140]   Yeah, it's a scoble here.
[00:41:51.140 --> 00:41:52.140]   Part of software.
[00:41:52.140 --> 00:41:53.140]   No, but I ran into it.
[00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:54.140]   Yes, we talked about this very thing.
[00:41:54.140 --> 00:41:59.140]   Now, scoble is, of course, he became well known as a blogger, but he is the product manager
[00:41:59.140 --> 00:42:01.140]   for Vista, Windows Vista at Microsoft.
[00:42:01.140 --> 00:42:02.140]   Yeah, Microsoft.
[00:42:02.140 --> 00:42:03.140]   What did he say?
[00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:11.140]   We were talking about this very thing about Apple's computers running both Windows and he'd probably
[00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:12.140]   have an inside track to that.
[00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:16.140]   Well, he said, "Oh, you know, I don't really sort of deal with those things, but I see that as a win-win
[00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:17.140]   for Microsoft."
[00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:18.140]   I think that's right.
[00:42:18.140 --> 00:42:22.140]   So, obviously, somebody up there way up the food chain gets it.
[00:42:22.140 --> 00:42:26.140]   Well, although you could, I don't think Robert speaks for Microsoft necessarily.
[00:42:26.140 --> 00:42:28.140]   Does anybody do that work at Microsoft?
[00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:31.140]   Use a rubber stamp for their business cards more seriously.
[00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:34.140]   Visit her website.
[00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:40.140]   Scoble is, I think, in, he's given free reign at Microsoft, but I don't know if he speaks
[00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:41.140]   for Microsoft.
[00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:43.140]   No, no, this was nothing of this was official.
[00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:44.140]   We just sort of tossed in the idea.
[00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:45.140]   It's good for why, wouldn't it?
[00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:49.140]   Why wouldn't they, except maybe that Dell would get upset or I don't think Microsoft cares
[00:42:49.140 --> 00:42:50.140]   if Dell doesn't.
[00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:51.140]   No, what is Dell going to do, right?
[00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:53.140]   Oh, we won't use Windows anymore.
[00:42:53.140 --> 00:42:55.140]   Well, they won't sell more copies of...
[00:42:55.140 --> 00:43:00.140]   Hey, there was a moment during the case where Microsoft did a strong arm Dell because Dell
[00:43:00.140 --> 00:43:04.140]   had released a bunch of Linux boxes early in the game and then they pulled them.
[00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:05.140]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:43:05.140 --> 00:43:07.140]   Now, Chris, you can get them, but it was there was there.
[00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:08.140]   They, they care about this.
[00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:09.140]   They don't advertise it.
[00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:10.140]   No.
[00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:11.140]   You have to ask for it.
[00:43:11.140 --> 00:43:12.140]   Yeah.
[00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:13.140]   I mean, at one time, they were pushing it.
[00:43:13.140 --> 00:43:16.140]   They have it's like under the counter.
[00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:19.140]   You got Linux on those things?
[00:43:19.140 --> 00:43:21.140]   Yeah, but shh.
[00:43:21.140 --> 00:43:22.140]   Knock three times.
[00:43:22.140 --> 00:43:24.140]   It's a special version of Windows.
[00:43:24.140 --> 00:43:26.140]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:28.140]   No, I think it, I'm sure it'll happen.
[00:43:28.140 --> 00:43:32.140]   In fact, I think that's one reason somebody should immediately on this panel buy an iMac.
[00:43:32.140 --> 00:43:33.140]   And try it.
[00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:34.140]   You already...
[00:43:34.140 --> 00:43:35.140]   Oh, yeah, I'll do it.
[00:43:35.140 --> 00:43:36.140]   Yeah.
[00:43:36.140 --> 00:43:38.140]   I made a money.
[00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:39.140]   That way the price will drop.
[00:43:39.140 --> 00:43:40.140]   Apparently.
[00:43:40.140 --> 00:43:41.140]   Yeah, and the price will drop.
[00:43:41.140 --> 00:43:45.660]   Was there another, wait a minute, before you go, hold on a second, because John, you said
[00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:46.660]   there was another thing you saw?
[00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:48.820]   There's another product that I like there that people should check out.
[00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:51.140]   I think it's kind of hard to find.
[00:43:51.140 --> 00:43:56.460]   Maybe some people didn't want to see what this was, but there was a little booth over by the
[00:43:56.460 --> 00:43:58.820]   Google booth called Live Worship.
[00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:00.580]   And as a religious product.
[00:44:00.580 --> 00:44:02.180]   And you know, you laugh.
[00:44:02.180 --> 00:44:03.180]   No, that's not me laughing.
[00:44:03.180 --> 00:44:04.180]   That's funny.
[00:44:04.180 --> 00:44:06.180]   There's plenty of people out there that could find these useful.
[00:44:06.180 --> 00:44:08.620]   It was an interesting, and I think you should check this out.
[00:44:08.620 --> 00:44:12.660]   It was an interesting competitor with PowerPoint.
[00:44:12.660 --> 00:44:14.380]   And it was designed for...
[00:44:14.380 --> 00:44:19.580]   It's actually got more versatility than PowerPoint because you can bring up any slide you want.
[00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:22.340]   And the reason for this thing, I don't think it was a big market.
[00:44:22.340 --> 00:44:23.900]   It's not the domination, right?
[00:44:23.900 --> 00:44:27.900]   Many people don't know that John was a Dominican priest for many years.
[00:44:27.900 --> 00:44:28.900]   A Dominican priest?
[00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:29.900]   Yeah.
[00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:30.900]   A Dominican priest.
[00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:31.900]   I don't think so.
[00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:32.900]   But anyway, the point is that this thing is...
[00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:34.900]   Does he look like he was a priest?
[00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:35.900]   A little bit.
[00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:36.900]   Father.
[00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:37.900]   Father de Borres.
[00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:38.900]   Father de Borres.
[00:44:38.900 --> 00:44:47.020]   I think someone should Photoshop John in a Pope outfit.
[00:44:47.020 --> 00:44:48.940]   I could be looking good.
[00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:55.620]   So anyway, the idea is this was used mainly for these mega churches have these rock bands
[00:44:55.620 --> 00:44:58.460]   that come in and they need that they do these light shows.
[00:44:58.460 --> 00:45:02.780]   And so apparently they came up with this thing so they could project all these kinds of interesting
[00:45:02.780 --> 00:45:05.260]   quotes from the Bible and whatever on the thing.
[00:45:05.260 --> 00:45:06.260]   Versus.
[00:45:06.260 --> 00:45:07.260]   That's what it is.
[00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:09.260]   And I was looking at it going...
[00:45:09.260 --> 00:45:10.260]   That's a quote.
[00:45:10.260 --> 00:45:11.660]   It's a quote from the Bible.
[00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:13.740]   How far he's fallen.
[00:45:13.740 --> 00:45:14.740]   But the point is...
[00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:17.340]   This man used to be a priest later.
[00:45:17.340 --> 00:45:22.740]   The point is that it's a very cool product and I think you should check it out, especially
[00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:26.980]   if you do a lot of public presentations because I think you can do some things in here that
[00:45:26.980 --> 00:45:29.660]   you can't do with the normal presentation software.
[00:45:29.660 --> 00:45:31.420]   Does it have wood textures?
[00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:33.220]   No, but you could probably...
[00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:36.060]   You know, it's probably got plugins.
[00:45:36.060 --> 00:45:40.300]   I just thought that was a good off the wall one.
[00:45:40.300 --> 00:45:41.300]   Delicious monsters.
[00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:42.300]   Isn't that amazing?
[00:45:42.300 --> 00:45:43.460]   Those are just library.
[00:45:43.460 --> 00:45:44.460]   Yeah.
[00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:45.460]   They really...
[00:45:45.460 --> 00:45:46.460]   That is an amazing product.
[00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:47.460]   I just...
[00:45:47.460 --> 00:45:49.020]   That's one of the most beautiful products.
[00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:50.980]   It's a library program and I never really understood.
[00:45:50.980 --> 00:45:56.180]   I don't know if there's a big market for people to catalog all their DVDs, books, music.
[00:45:56.180 --> 00:45:57.420]   But if you're ever going to do it, it's great.
[00:45:57.420 --> 00:46:00.140]   It uses the eyesight to scan the barcode.
[00:46:00.140 --> 00:46:05.220]   It'll go to Amazon, get the album mark, puts it in a 3D thing on the shelf, downloads
[00:46:05.220 --> 00:46:06.220]   reviews...
[00:46:06.220 --> 00:46:08.220]   It's just a perfect thing for a nutball.
[00:46:08.220 --> 00:46:09.220]   Yeah.
[00:46:09.220 --> 00:46:10.220]   Obsessive, compulsive nutballs, actually.
[00:46:10.220 --> 00:46:13.860]   Well, all of us have your elephant-like memory for everything they...
[00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:14.860]   What was that?
[00:46:14.860 --> 00:46:15.860]   It's like a memory.
[00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:20.620]   It's called the Diet Coke.
[00:46:20.620 --> 00:46:21.620]   Hands off the Mr. Pibben.
[00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:22.620]   No one gets hurt.
[00:46:22.620 --> 00:46:23.620]   Is it?
[00:46:23.620 --> 00:46:24.620]   It's really good.
[00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:25.620]   Yeah.
[00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:26.620]   Comic Life won an award.
[00:46:26.620 --> 00:46:28.620]   There were some awards that I guess that were presented, I don't know.
[00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:30.220]   Is that Mac only software?
[00:46:30.220 --> 00:46:31.220]   Comic Life.
[00:46:31.220 --> 00:46:32.220]   Yeah.
[00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:33.220]   Was it Comic Life the one where you can put yourself in a cartoon?
[00:46:33.220 --> 00:46:34.220]   Yeah, it's really cool.
[00:46:34.220 --> 00:46:36.460]   Yeah, it's a really beautiful program.
[00:46:36.460 --> 00:46:38.460]   It's only 20 bucks or something is actually...
[00:46:38.460 --> 00:46:39.460]   Yeah, it's really interesting.
[00:46:39.460 --> 00:46:41.420]   ...plask is the company, PLASQ.
[00:46:41.420 --> 00:46:44.220]   I think Metaverse distributes it, but they...
[00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:46.220]   Freeverse, not Metaverse.
[00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:49.220]   Metaverse is Adam Curry's ISP.
[00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:52.220]   I don't know, I'm sorry.
[00:46:52.220 --> 00:46:53.220]   I'm sorry.
[00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:55.220]   I don't know where that came from.
[00:46:55.220 --> 00:46:57.220]   Thank you, Leo.
[00:46:57.220 --> 00:47:01.220]   MTVVJs for 30, Alex.
[00:47:01.220 --> 00:47:04.140]   Freeverse, thank you.
[00:47:04.140 --> 00:47:05.900]   It's a cool program though.
[00:47:05.900 --> 00:47:08.700]   It actually interfaces with your iPhoto library.
[00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:12.500]   So you can just drag pictures out of iPhoto and then has a variety of comic styles and
[00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:14.740]   you could put bubbles on it and stuff.
[00:47:14.740 --> 00:47:15.740]   It's very...
[00:47:15.740 --> 00:47:16.740]   That's great.
[00:47:16.740 --> 00:47:17.740]   Yeah, it was pretty cool.
[00:47:17.740 --> 00:47:18.740]   Yeah, Comic Life.
[00:47:18.740 --> 00:47:19.740]   Yes, sir.
[00:47:19.740 --> 00:47:21.740]   Well, a special hello to Amber, fellow Canadian here.
[00:47:21.740 --> 00:47:22.740]   Hi there.
[00:47:22.740 --> 00:47:27.700]   Question for the GWT panel or I guess that's sort of a half-eaten donut there.
[00:47:27.700 --> 00:47:32.020]   But one million dot Mac users right now.
[00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:33.020]   Which seemed low to me.
[00:47:33.020 --> 00:47:34.780]   It seemed like a low number.
[00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:36.540]   Yeah, but here's an interesting question.
[00:47:36.540 --> 00:47:39.980]   So now we have iWeb.
[00:47:39.980 --> 00:47:42.780]   And what is that going to do?
[00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:46.940]   What are your thoughts in terms of the growth in dot Mac usage?
[00:47:46.940 --> 00:47:49.820]   Is that going to drive a lot of people, I think, for myself.
[00:47:49.820 --> 00:47:52.580]   I was really attracted to what I saw.
[00:47:52.580 --> 00:47:53.580]   So that's question one.
[00:47:53.580 --> 00:47:57.300]   And the second thing is, in terms of the workflows, Leo, you've talked a lot about the workflow
[00:47:57.300 --> 00:48:02.540]   to create a podcast being a little bit of magic, a lot of work.
[00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:03.540]   I was depressed.
[00:48:03.540 --> 00:48:06.180]   It made it look so easy, I thought, oh, there it goes.
[00:48:06.180 --> 00:48:07.820]   Everybody's going to make one now.
[00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:08.820]   Exactly.
[00:48:08.820 --> 00:48:09.820]   Geez.
[00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:10.820]   So what was your...
[00:48:10.820 --> 00:48:13.580]   So I'll just leave you guys to talk about those two things.
[00:48:13.580 --> 00:48:17.220]   Podcasting workflows and what do you think is happening with iWeb and dot Mac in terms
[00:48:17.220 --> 00:48:18.380]   of growth and dot Mac?
[00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:20.140]   And is that really viable?
[00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:21.900]   I think iWeb is a great program.
[00:48:21.900 --> 00:48:24.860]   I don't know if everybody's had a chance to learn a little bit about it.
[00:48:24.860 --> 00:48:29.780]   But I think it really takes a lot of the tools that are built in to the Mac and makes them
[00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:33.020]   integrated and really easy to use and really easy to share more importantly.
[00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:37.660]   So you can share your iPhoto pictures, you can do a podcast, you can have...
[00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:38.660]   It's like a blogging software.
[00:48:38.660 --> 00:48:39.660]   Well, it's not just...
[00:48:39.660 --> 00:48:41.500]   I mean, it's really creative about creating your own website.
[00:48:41.500 --> 00:48:45.420]   Yeah, was it blogging time websites or live journal websites or my space?
[00:48:45.420 --> 00:48:46.420]   You know what it is?
[00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:48.620]   It's a much nicer, cleaner MySpace.
[00:48:48.620 --> 00:48:49.620]   It really is.
[00:48:49.620 --> 00:48:53.260]   So you can drag your iTunes playlists, for instance, right to it and it will...
[00:48:53.260 --> 00:48:55.300]   So Mac, people can date faster and more efficient.
[00:48:55.300 --> 00:48:58.700]   No, it actually leaves out a lot of that.
[00:48:58.700 --> 00:49:00.700]   It leaves out the...
[00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:02.260]   It leaves out the sleasiness.
[00:49:02.260 --> 00:49:03.980]   It's not going to go anywhere.
[00:49:03.980 --> 00:49:05.460]   People bring the sleasiness.
[00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:06.460]   If the sleasiness is...
[00:49:06.460 --> 00:49:09.500]   Well, put it this way, for the average person who doesn't know how to build a website and
[00:49:09.500 --> 00:49:13.380]   doesn't really take advantage of all the tools they have in their Mac, like iPhoto and iMovie,
[00:49:13.380 --> 00:49:17.180]   it makes it really easy to put all that information online and be able to share all that information
[00:49:17.180 --> 00:49:18.180]   with RSS.
[00:49:18.180 --> 00:49:20.700]   So, yeah, I mean, it's good for anyone.
[00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:23.980]   Literally in a few minutes, you can set up a website.
[00:49:23.980 --> 00:49:25.220]   He's never made a website.
[00:49:25.220 --> 00:49:26.220]   It's like...
[00:49:26.220 --> 00:49:27.220]   You don't even blog.
[00:49:27.220 --> 00:49:28.220]   It's a trend.
[00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:29.220]   It's a source box.
[00:49:29.220 --> 00:49:31.220]   Yes, it is a trend.
[00:49:31.220 --> 00:49:32.220]   Good one.
[00:49:32.220 --> 00:49:35.860]   You haven't updated your blogs in St. Patrick's Day.
[00:49:35.860 --> 00:49:36.860]   Nope.
[00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:37.860]   We made it.
[00:49:37.860 --> 00:49:38.860]   We said you're going to do a blog in St. Patrick's Day.
[00:49:38.860 --> 00:49:39.860]   He did.
[00:49:39.860 --> 00:49:44.740]   Hey, by the way, this is the one year anniversary of the first Twit pilot, which we did sitting
[00:49:44.740 --> 00:49:45.740]   around the table.
[00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:46.740]   Well, we know it was a pilot.
[00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:48.460]   We didn't know, but it was at the...
[00:49:48.460 --> 00:49:53.220]   And you were there and you and you and you at the 21st Amendment brewery.
[00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:56.220]   So anyway, I just thought I'd throw that in.
[00:49:56.220 --> 00:50:03.420]   I can't remember why I blocked that one.
[00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:07.700]   I think actually it's telling that only a million dot Mac accounts have been sold.
[00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:09.460]   I mean, how many millions of Mac users are there?
[00:50:09.460 --> 00:50:10.460]   This is a cost.
[00:50:10.460 --> 00:50:11.460]   99 bucks.
[00:50:11.460 --> 00:50:12.460]   I think it's a little expensive.
[00:50:12.460 --> 00:50:13.460]   And I think it's a little expensive.
[00:50:13.460 --> 00:50:14.460]   And until now, there's really not...
[00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:15.460]   99 bucks for you.
[00:50:15.460 --> 00:50:16.460]   You have a lifetime website.
[00:50:16.460 --> 00:50:17.460]   A year.
[00:50:17.460 --> 00:50:18.460]   99 bucks a year.
[00:50:18.460 --> 00:50:19.460]   I think it's too expensive for you.
[00:50:19.460 --> 00:50:20.460]   A lot of other.
[00:50:20.460 --> 00:50:21.460]   That's pretty steep.
[00:50:21.460 --> 00:50:22.460]   And I think that's been one of the problems.
[00:50:22.460 --> 00:50:23.460]   Hey, David Pogue is here.
[00:50:23.460 --> 00:50:24.460]   That's great.
[00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:29.020]   And ladies and gentlemen, David Pogue's brother is here too.
[00:50:29.020 --> 00:50:32.980]   Roger, why don't you let David come on over here and come on, David.
[00:50:32.980 --> 00:50:34.220]   Thank you for coming over.
[00:50:34.220 --> 00:50:35.220]   Yeah.
[00:50:35.220 --> 00:50:36.220]   David Pogue was almost over.
[00:50:36.220 --> 00:50:37.220]   Thanks for showing up.
[00:50:37.220 --> 00:50:38.780]   No, no, no.
[00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:43.900]   He was at the Apple store where he was doing a competing event.
[00:50:43.900 --> 00:50:44.900]   Did you have as many?
[00:50:44.900 --> 00:50:46.660]   He was easily five times this.
[00:50:46.660 --> 00:50:48.420]   That's what I thought.
[00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:49.900]   Sit your...
[00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:50.900]   So you were doing...
[00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:51.900]   What were you doing?
[00:50:51.900 --> 00:50:52.900]   You were doing secrets of Tiger?
[00:50:52.900 --> 00:50:55.500]   Two faves, top 25 undocumented tips.
[00:50:55.500 --> 00:50:56.500]   That's good.
[00:50:56.500 --> 00:51:00.580]   So we actually talked to you a little bit in the press room.
[00:51:00.580 --> 00:51:03.020]   And you were underwhelmed by Iweb.
[00:51:03.020 --> 00:51:04.020]   You know what?
[00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:07.260]   I have since had a personal demo by Mr. Schiller.
[00:51:07.260 --> 00:51:09.180]   And I asked him all the questions we had.
[00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:13.020]   Like, does it have to be dot Mac or can you just save it out as HTML?
[00:51:13.020 --> 00:51:14.220]   And the answer is yes.
[00:51:14.220 --> 00:51:17.420]   And you have to use those templates or can you be much more random?
[00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:18.420]   And the answer is yes.
[00:51:18.420 --> 00:51:20.420]   So I'm morewhelmed.
[00:51:20.420 --> 00:51:25.420]   Did you ask him if it can be less than $99?
[00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:26.420]   It's...
[00:51:26.420 --> 00:51:27.420]   Yeah.
[00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:28.420]   It's already less than $99.
[00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:30.420]   No, he's talking about dot Mac.
[00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:31.420]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:51:31.420 --> 00:51:32.420]   Iweb is $79.
[00:51:32.420 --> 00:51:34.420]   Well, $79 with five other folks.
[00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:35.420]   No, that's a good deal.
[00:51:35.420 --> 00:51:36.420]   Let's talk about Iweb.
[00:51:36.420 --> 00:51:37.420]   We really didn't discuss it.
[00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:39.420]   That's what we were just talking about.
[00:51:39.420 --> 00:51:42.420]   Look, no, no, I'm saying.
[00:51:42.420 --> 00:51:44.420]   I'm waiting for all the words to do.
[00:51:44.420 --> 00:51:47.420]   John, it lets you create a website really easily.
[00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:50.380]   It's lame, rather than just going on to what it calls.
[00:51:50.380 --> 00:51:51.380]   Or whatever.
[00:51:51.380 --> 00:51:52.380]   I mean, what does it do?
[00:51:52.380 --> 00:51:53.380]   What does I look?
[00:51:53.380 --> 00:51:54.380]   Because I didn't see the demo of it.
[00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:59.380]   It's basically a drag and drop page layout program that with one click becomes a website.
[00:51:59.380 --> 00:52:03.380]   It handles blogs for you and podcasts and RSS feeds it.
[00:52:03.380 --> 00:52:05.380]   It's the MySpace thing.
[00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:07.380]   It easily allows you to make a web page.
[00:52:07.380 --> 00:52:08.380]   What was it, another one?
[00:52:08.380 --> 00:52:09.380]   I'm Mac.
[00:52:09.380 --> 00:52:10.380]   You need...
[00:52:10.380 --> 00:52:11.380]   You don't have to...
[00:52:11.380 --> 00:52:12.380]   I'm Mac and...
[00:52:12.380 --> 00:52:13.380]   Iweb is kind of...
[00:52:13.380 --> 00:52:14.380]   I like it.
[00:52:14.380 --> 00:52:15.380]   I'm sick.
[00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:16.380]   I'm so confused.
[00:52:16.380 --> 00:52:17.380]   It's the...
[00:52:17.380 --> 00:52:19.380]   He's an unfrozen caveman lawyer.
[00:52:19.380 --> 00:52:21.380]   [laughter]
[00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:23.380]   [applause]
[00:52:23.380 --> 00:52:26.380]   You're a modern world confused.
[00:52:26.380 --> 00:52:28.380]   Isn't frightened of him.
[00:52:28.380 --> 00:52:29.380]   It does.
[00:52:29.380 --> 00:52:30.380]   It does absolutely.
[00:52:30.380 --> 00:52:32.380]   Finally, when it goes, I'm Mac.
[00:52:32.380 --> 00:52:33.380]   There's Iweb.
[00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:34.380]   There's .Mac.
[00:52:34.380 --> 00:52:35.380]   I don't know.
[00:52:35.380 --> 00:52:37.380]   And then there's the Mac book, Corduro Powers.
[00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:38.380]   [laughter]
[00:52:38.380 --> 00:52:39.380]   The Power Book History.
[00:52:39.380 --> 00:52:40.380]   Whatever it was.
[00:52:40.380 --> 00:52:41.380]   I think...
[00:52:41.380 --> 00:52:42.380]   I'm a God.
[00:52:42.380 --> 00:52:43.380]   I got a great book for you, John.
[00:52:43.380 --> 00:52:44.380]   It'll...
[00:52:44.380 --> 00:52:45.380]   I want your books.
[00:52:45.380 --> 00:52:46.380]   Yeah.
[00:52:46.380 --> 00:52:47.380]   I want it autographed.
[00:52:47.380 --> 00:52:50.380]   But I don't put my name on it because then I can't resell it.
[00:52:50.380 --> 00:52:51.380]   Power Book History.
[00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:55.380]   I usually just write to eBay customer, Leo Lebort.
[00:52:55.380 --> 00:52:56.380]   [laughter]
[00:52:56.380 --> 00:52:57.380]   I find that's the best.
[00:52:57.380 --> 00:52:58.380]   That works.
[00:52:58.380 --> 00:52:59.380]   Strategy.
[00:52:59.380 --> 00:53:03.380]   So, David, what did you think was interesting in all of this today?
[00:53:03.380 --> 00:53:04.380]   Anything?
[00:53:04.380 --> 00:53:06.380]   You know, the Intel stuff looked pretty good.
[00:53:06.380 --> 00:53:09.380]   And then, like I say, then you go and you play with it.
[00:53:09.380 --> 00:53:11.380]   And you know, the speed matters.
[00:53:11.380 --> 00:53:12.380]   I mean, you suddenly...
[00:53:12.380 --> 00:53:13.380]   It's a big difference.
[00:53:13.380 --> 00:53:14.380]   Wow.
[00:53:14.380 --> 00:53:15.380]   And did you try starting one up?
[00:53:15.380 --> 00:53:16.380]   Yeah.
[00:53:16.380 --> 00:53:18.380]   And then, you know, it's a little bit more than you can see.
[00:53:18.380 --> 00:53:20.380]   And then, you know, it's a little bit more than you can see.
[00:53:20.380 --> 00:53:22.380]   And then, you know, it's a little bit more than you can see.
[00:53:22.380 --> 00:53:24.380]   And then, you know, it's a little bit more than you can see.
[00:53:24.380 --> 00:53:26.380]   And then, you know, it's a little bit more than you can see.
[00:53:26.380 --> 00:53:29.380]   And then, you know, it's a little bit more than you can see.
[00:53:29.380 --> 00:53:31.380]   And then, you know, it's a little bit more than you can see.
[00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:33.380]   And then, you know, it's a little bit more than you can see.
[00:53:33.380 --> 00:53:35.380]   And then, you know, it's a little bit more than you can see.
[00:53:35.380 --> 00:53:36.380]   And then, you know, it's a little bit more than you can see.
[00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:37.380]   And then, you know, it's a little bit more than you can see.
[00:53:37.380 --> 00:53:47.380]   And then, you know, it's a little bit more than you can see.
[00:53:47.380 --> 00:53:52.380]   And then, you know, it's a little bit more than you can see.
[00:53:52.380 --> 00:53:57.380]   And then, you know, it's a little bit more than you can see.
[00:53:57.380 --> 00:54:04.380]   And then, you know, it's a little bit more than you can see.
[00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:09.380]   And then, you know what?
[00:54:09.380 --> 00:54:12.380]   Because our buddy back here is going on.
[00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:13.380]   But I'm never going to do it wet.
[00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:16.380]   I'm just going to use this from now on, because it's going to be so much easier.
[00:54:16.380 --> 00:54:17.380]   Does it do blogging?
[00:54:17.380 --> 00:54:18.380]   Yes.
[00:54:18.380 --> 00:54:19.380]   Do it.
[00:54:19.380 --> 00:54:20.380]   You know, your transcript's a little thin on the eye web.
[00:54:20.380 --> 00:54:21.380]   There's an eye.
[00:54:21.380 --> 00:54:22.380]   A lot of nice viewer questions.
[00:54:22.380 --> 00:54:24.380]   It actually does a good job with podcasts.
[00:54:24.380 --> 00:54:25.380]   It does a good job with blogs.
[00:54:25.380 --> 00:54:26.380]   I was pretty impressed.
[00:54:26.380 --> 00:54:28.380]   Well, none of us has actually used it.
[00:54:28.380 --> 00:54:29.380]   Well, I played with it.
[00:54:29.380 --> 00:54:30.380]   We played with it.
[00:54:30.380 --> 00:54:31.380]   We played with it.
[00:54:31.380 --> 00:54:32.380]   We played with it.
[00:54:32.380 --> 00:54:33.380]   We played with demos.
[00:54:33.380 --> 00:54:34.380]   No, we played with it.
[00:54:34.380 --> 00:54:35.380]   We sat down.
[00:54:35.380 --> 00:54:37.380]   We've done a website and sustained it over.
[00:54:37.380 --> 00:54:38.380]   Why don't we do an actually published one today?
[00:54:38.380 --> 00:54:41.380]   Why don't we do a play with it?
[00:54:41.380 --> 00:54:42.380]   That's not what you over here.
[00:54:42.380 --> 00:54:45.380]   Nikki, what do you want to know, Nikki?
[00:54:45.380 --> 00:54:51.380]   Well, my question is, looking at this new Intel PowerBook, whatever, it's called.
[00:54:51.380 --> 00:54:53.380]   I believe you want MacBook Pro.
[00:54:53.380 --> 00:54:55.380]   I cannot remember this name.
[00:54:55.380 --> 00:54:56.380]   I swear.
[00:54:56.380 --> 00:54:59.380]   There's many problems with it that people aren't addressing.
[00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:04.380]   One to remote.
[00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:09.380]   It's just going to float around the bottom.
[00:55:09.380 --> 00:55:10.380]   Somebody's bag.
[00:55:10.380 --> 00:55:14.380]   It's a selling point for Apple to charge you 50 bucks if you want.
[00:55:14.380 --> 00:55:17.380]   I are, which I should use radio frequency.
[00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:18.380]   The laptop is extremely hot.
[00:55:18.380 --> 00:55:22.380]   If men put it on the laptop, they're going to have no children.
[00:55:22.380 --> 00:55:23.380]   Which is not necessary.
[00:55:23.380 --> 00:55:24.380]   That could be a selling point.
[00:55:24.380 --> 00:55:25.380]   It's not.
[00:55:25.380 --> 00:55:26.380]   I'm going to buy one for every guy in here.
[00:55:26.380 --> 00:55:28.380]   It's a selling price though for that price.
[00:55:28.380 --> 00:55:36.380]   Honestly, I'll just go buy a $600 laptop at CompUSA and download OS 1086 for the same thing.
[00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:38.380]   And then it'll break in six months.
[00:55:38.380 --> 00:55:41.380]   Because Mac products never, ever break.
[00:55:41.380 --> 00:55:42.380]   No, no, no.
[00:55:42.380 --> 00:55:45.380]   He's talking about the fact that Apple just make it so it doesn't work in six months.
[00:55:45.380 --> 00:55:48.380]   Nikki, you might do that, but not most of us.
[00:55:48.380 --> 00:55:50.380]   Most people are not going to do that.
[00:55:50.380 --> 00:55:51.380]   I mean, I think that if you want to--
[00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:53.380]   So you don't like this thing apparently.
[00:55:53.380 --> 00:55:54.380]   No.
[00:55:54.380 --> 00:55:55.380]   Well, you're the only one here that I think that feels that way.
[00:55:55.380 --> 00:55:57.380]   I have to don't get questions like that.
[00:55:57.380 --> 00:56:01.380]   It reminds me of Gmail when it came out and how it would put ads off to the right of your
[00:56:01.380 --> 00:56:03.380]   incoming mail based on a scan of the content.
[00:56:03.380 --> 00:56:06.380]   And it was like, "Oh my God, they're looking in my underwear drawer.
[00:56:06.380 --> 00:56:08.380]   They're going to know my innermost thoughts."
[00:56:08.380 --> 00:56:10.380]   And I'm like, "First of all, it's software."
[00:56:10.380 --> 00:56:11.380]   And second, you don't have to use it.
[00:56:11.380 --> 00:56:15.380]   So if you're worried about the remote control, throw away the remote control.
[00:56:15.380 --> 00:56:17.380]   And then you have a power book like it was before.
[00:56:17.380 --> 00:56:22.380]   No, but my question is why don't you have to use radio frequency instead of IR?
[00:56:22.380 --> 00:56:24.380]   You're still going to lose it in your bag.
[00:56:24.380 --> 00:56:31.380]   No, but it means when it's better, because line the side, I thought you're getting rid of IR.
[00:56:31.380 --> 00:56:32.380]   I thought it was like--
[00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:33.380]   IR is a strange choice.
[00:56:33.380 --> 00:56:34.380]   Why not?
[00:56:34.380 --> 00:56:35.380]   Right.
[00:56:35.380 --> 00:56:37.380]   Well, because you're not standing behind your power book watching movies.
[00:56:37.380 --> 00:56:38.380]   Exactly.
[00:56:38.380 --> 00:56:41.380]   You've got it set up somewhere.
[00:56:41.380 --> 00:56:45.380]   No, I mean, that's the point of front row.
[00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:46.380]   That's the whole idea.
[00:56:46.380 --> 00:56:50.380]   What's the whole point of putting a remote with a notebook that you're going to have sitting
[00:56:50.380 --> 00:56:51.380]   in front of you?
[00:56:51.380 --> 00:56:52.380]   What?
[00:56:52.380 --> 00:56:53.380]   No, it's across the room.
[00:56:53.380 --> 00:56:54.380]   Right, but what if you're not leaving it?
[00:56:54.380 --> 00:56:56.380]   So what if I close it and leave it running?
[00:56:56.380 --> 00:56:57.380]   How are you going to navigate here?
[00:56:57.380 --> 00:56:58.380]   I'm driving my HDTV.
[00:56:58.380 --> 00:57:00.380]   Actually, I have an answer for that.
[00:57:00.380 --> 00:57:03.380]   This thing has a driver for the 30-inch display, this laptop.
[00:57:03.380 --> 00:57:04.380]   That's right.
[00:57:04.380 --> 00:57:09.380]   And the IR receiver is not on the lid, but on the driver half.
[00:57:09.380 --> 00:57:12.380]   But want to go to sleep if you close it?
[00:57:12.380 --> 00:57:14.380]   Not if you-- I don't know.
[00:57:14.380 --> 00:57:16.380]   Can we cut to a commercial?
[00:57:16.380 --> 00:57:20.380]   I would doubt that there wasn't a toggle that doesn't--
[00:57:20.380 --> 00:57:21.380]   There should be.
[00:57:21.380 --> 00:57:22.380]   There will be.
[00:57:22.380 --> 00:57:24.380]   It's a great-- then it's a great media center.
[00:57:24.380 --> 00:57:26.380]   Yeah, I'm sure that's why I was designed that.
[00:57:26.380 --> 00:57:27.380]   Yeah, it's a media center.
[00:57:27.380 --> 00:57:28.380]   And I think it's a great idea.
[00:57:28.380 --> 00:57:29.380]   And then--
[00:57:29.380 --> 00:57:36.380]   If you close it, you can continue to watch the movie on the screen.
[00:57:36.380 --> 00:57:40.380]   Yeah, but then you're doing one of these jobs and across the room trying to hit the notebook.
[00:57:40.380 --> 00:57:42.380]   That's the thing with the IR.
[00:57:42.380 --> 00:57:43.380]   It's a good idea to have the remote.
[00:57:43.380 --> 00:57:44.380]   Somebody's got it.
[00:57:44.380 --> 00:57:48.380]   But when I'm in a hotel, and I'm not going to-- if I want to set it up and watch a movie,
[00:57:48.380 --> 00:57:49.380]   I have to be right in front of it.
[00:57:49.380 --> 00:57:52.380]   I'm not going to take the time to hook a notebook up to a hotel TV.
[00:57:52.380 --> 00:57:54.380]   I'm going to sit there and watch the screen on the notebook.
[00:57:54.380 --> 00:57:58.380]   By the way, this woman has OS X running on a Sony PlayStation portable.
[00:57:58.380 --> 00:58:01.380]   I am not kidding.
[00:58:01.380 --> 00:58:02.380]   She does.
[00:58:02.380 --> 00:58:04.380]   I don't know how legal it is, but--
[00:58:04.380 --> 00:58:06.380]   I'm not sure she's speaking for the--
[00:58:06.380 --> 00:58:08.380]   As the masses, exactly.
[00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:10.380]   Yeah, I think she's got a good criticism, though.
[00:58:10.380 --> 00:58:12.380]   Now we'll get rid of the universal remote.
[00:58:12.380 --> 00:58:14.380]   Well, nobody else does that.
[00:58:14.380 --> 00:58:15.380]   Why should Apple do that?
[00:58:15.380 --> 00:58:16.380]   Well, nobody else does that.
[00:58:16.380 --> 00:58:17.380]   Well, nobody else does that.
[00:58:17.380 --> 00:58:18.380]   Why should Apple do that?
[00:58:18.380 --> 00:58:19.380]   Because it's IR.
[00:58:19.380 --> 00:58:21.380]   Oh, I suppose you could program it to--
[00:58:21.380 --> 00:58:22.380]   There's probably a code.
[00:58:22.380 --> 00:58:23.380]   You could probably do that.
[00:58:23.380 --> 00:58:25.380]   Some of you can program, so you can--
[00:58:25.380 --> 00:58:27.380]   It's not a lot of logic from universal remote.
[00:58:27.380 --> 00:58:28.380]   It's a good idea.
[00:58:28.380 --> 00:58:32.380]   Yeah, and I actually did this with the new iMac, because they had the same remote there.
[00:58:32.380 --> 00:58:35.380]   And I used Belkin's Media Center keyboard.
[00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:36.380]   And it worked.
[00:58:36.380 --> 00:58:37.380]   Yeah.
[00:58:37.380 --> 00:58:38.380]   Thank you.
[00:58:38.380 --> 00:58:39.380]   Thank you.
[00:58:39.380 --> 00:58:41.380]   Another question from the floor.
[00:58:41.380 --> 00:58:42.380]   Okay.
[00:58:42.380 --> 00:58:46.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:58:46.380 --> 00:58:47.380]   Just one item.
[00:58:47.380 --> 00:58:51.380]   First of all, the first-- and I'm going to stutter all over the place.
[00:58:51.380 --> 00:58:52.380]   I'm sorry.
[00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:58.380]   But the first thing is that the MySpace equals iWeb thing is like nails on the chalkboard,
[00:58:58.380 --> 00:59:00.380]   comparing iWeb to the cesspool of humanity.
[00:59:00.380 --> 00:59:01.380]   Yeah, totally.
[00:59:01.380 --> 00:59:02.380]   No, I agree.
[00:59:02.380 --> 00:59:03.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:59:03.380 --> 00:59:07.380]   What I was saying is a clean MySpace that I would have--
[00:59:07.380 --> 00:59:08.380]   My kids--
[00:59:08.380 --> 00:59:09.380]   It's not MySpace.
[00:59:09.380 --> 00:59:10.380]   No, you understand?
[00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:13.380]   I have a 13-year-old who has a page of MySpace.
[00:59:13.380 --> 00:59:14.380]   Your mission is point, I think.
[00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:16.380]   His point is that it's nothing like MySpace.
[00:59:16.380 --> 00:59:18.380]   Well, that's not true, because I think we're just comparing it to MySpace.
[00:59:18.380 --> 00:59:21.380]   If you know what MySpace is, you're going to say it's a blogging tool.
[00:59:21.380 --> 00:59:24.380]   And it has-- you know, it's-- you share music, and you make friends.
[00:59:24.380 --> 00:59:25.380]   It's--
[00:59:25.380 --> 00:59:26.380]   I can tell my 13-year-old.
[00:59:26.380 --> 00:59:27.380]   You can use this.
[00:59:27.380 --> 00:59:28.380]   You may no longer use MySpace.
[00:59:28.380 --> 00:59:29.380]   Well, are you saying--
[00:59:29.380 --> 00:59:30.380]   Well, I'll be kidding.
[00:59:30.380 --> 00:59:33.380]   Are you saying that it's MySpace that brought the dirty nasty people?
[00:59:33.380 --> 00:59:35.380]   No dirty nasty people are going to show up on iWeb.
[00:59:35.380 --> 00:59:37.380]   That's a heck of a thing for--
[00:59:37.380 --> 00:59:38.380]   Well, that's a thing.
[00:59:38.380 --> 00:59:39.380]   It's not the same.
[00:59:39.380 --> 00:59:40.380]   It's not the same.
[00:59:40.380 --> 00:59:41.380]   It's not the same.
[00:59:41.380 --> 00:59:43.380]   The web design program, MySpace, is a web site.
[00:59:43.380 --> 00:59:45.380]   All right, I'm sorry I mentioned it.
[00:59:45.380 --> 00:59:46.380]   It's okay.
[00:59:46.380 --> 00:59:47.380]   I thought--
[00:59:47.380 --> 00:59:53.380]   Okay, if we're getting it right, you're comparing it to the web design tools in MySpace.
[00:59:53.380 --> 00:59:54.380]   No, no, no, no.
[00:59:54.380 --> 00:59:59.380]   I'm saying that MyKids think that making your own web page means--
[00:59:59.380 --> 01:00:00.380]   My kids are iKids.
[01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:01.380]   iKids.
[01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:02.380]   [laughter]
[01:00:02.380 --> 01:00:04.380]   My kids are--
[01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:05.380]   Great, Mark.
[01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:06.380]   I'll get the season.
[01:00:06.380 --> 01:00:11.380]   We'll think that making a web page means going to MySpace and making a web page there.
[01:00:11.380 --> 01:00:17.380]   Now I can say, no, no, no, look, you can do all of that just as easily in a better environment.
[01:00:17.380 --> 01:00:18.380]   And that's what--
[01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:19.380]   Dad, we're not in MySpace anymore.
[01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:20.380]   It sucks.
[01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:21.380]   That's what they're going to say.
[01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:25.380]   They're going to say none of my friends are on iOver here and they're all in MySpace.
[01:00:25.380 --> 01:00:26.380]   So--
[01:00:26.380 --> 01:00:28.380]   My kids have 90 hours of got back.
[01:00:28.380 --> 01:00:29.380]   Well, they can use dads account.
[01:00:29.380 --> 01:00:36.380]   Actually, one of the things we saw at the web 2.0 is we talked about the average spending habit for consumer electronics and consumables and crap.
[01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:39.380]   And 17-year-olds are spending more on it than you and I are.
[01:00:39.380 --> 01:00:40.380]   It's a little--
[01:00:40.380 --> 01:00:41.380]   That isn't MySpace free.
[01:00:41.380 --> 01:00:43.380]   Yeah, so forget I mentioned MySpace.
[01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:44.380]   90-90 dollars.
[01:00:44.380 --> 01:00:45.380]   This is free.
[01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:46.380]   Forget it.
[01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:47.380]   That was a bad idea.
[01:00:47.380 --> 01:00:48.380]   It's going to take a--
[01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:52.380]   But my job at this point is why compare the sophisticated, brilliant tools inside of iWib.
[01:00:52.380 --> 01:00:53.380]   Am I getting it so far?
[01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:54.380]   Am I spinning it?
[01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:55.380]   [laughter]
[01:00:55.380 --> 01:00:59.380]   But here's my question for you.
[01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:06.380]   People make crap out of MySpace because they pick horrible things and they tile them on there and they do weird pictures and they blow up and they pick horrible fonts.
[01:01:06.380 --> 01:01:10.380]   Can I not do crappy design instead of inside of iWib if I want to?
[01:01:10.380 --> 01:01:11.380]   Most definitely.
[01:01:11.380 --> 01:01:12.380]   Excellent.
[01:01:12.380 --> 01:01:13.380]   [laughter]
[01:01:13.380 --> 01:01:14.380]   That's exactly the same.
[01:01:14.380 --> 01:01:15.380]   Your second point.
[01:01:15.380 --> 01:01:17.380]   I just had one other thing.
[01:01:17.380 --> 01:01:21.380]   With this transition that we're going over, I'm a little slow on the page here.
[01:01:21.380 --> 01:01:23.380]   I'm just still trying to catch up with everything.
[01:01:23.380 --> 01:01:35.380]   With this transition over to the OS 10 on the Intel, what I noticed when I do a format and reinstall on a Windows XP machine is that, like, for a customer, like, over a period of a year when I go back and visit the device.
[01:01:35.380 --> 01:01:39.380]   Even if they've not downloaded a ton of crap onto the machine, it's slower.
[01:01:39.380 --> 01:01:44.380]   We're talking about all the speed, but are we going to be hitting the same type of wall?
[01:01:44.380 --> 01:01:46.380]   I don't think that's an Intel problem.
[01:01:46.380 --> 01:01:47.380]   I think that's an OS problem.
[01:01:47.380 --> 01:01:50.380]   I don't think it's going to get slower because it's still...
[01:01:50.380 --> 01:01:52.380]   Well, you can build full of proof Windows machines.
[01:01:52.380 --> 01:01:55.380]   Yeah, you just make sure they can't log in as administrator in there.
[01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:56.380]   That's part of it.
[01:01:56.380 --> 01:01:57.380]   But that's inconvenient.
[01:01:57.380 --> 01:02:00.380]   Yeah, I'm just referring to the build itself on OS 10.
[01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:02.380]   Are we built to handle it?
[01:02:02.380 --> 01:02:03.380]   No, I think it'll be fun.
[01:02:03.380 --> 01:02:05.380]   I don't think Intel makes any difference in that regard.
[01:02:05.380 --> 01:02:08.380]   By the way, you want to know something weird that they did not say at the keynote?
[01:02:08.380 --> 01:02:11.380]   We've already heard that Photoshop and Steve Jobs...
[01:02:11.380 --> 01:02:12.380]   Oh, it's a little...
[01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:20.380]   Okay, if you open this $900 program once in a while, but all the people who actually have to use it, you won't be able to do it until...
[01:02:20.380 --> 01:02:24.380]   Well, there's a bunch of things that Phil Schiller later said will not run in it.
[01:02:24.380 --> 01:02:27.380]   Like any video editing programs, including Final Cut...
[01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:28.380]   Will not run at all.
[01:02:28.380 --> 01:02:30.380]   Will not run until they release their dual binary.
[01:02:30.380 --> 01:02:33.380]   You're referring to the OS as the $900?
[01:02:33.380 --> 01:02:34.380]   There is a Photoshop.
[01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:35.380]   I'm talking about...
[01:02:35.380 --> 01:02:41.380]   He was referring to this large group of casual users who dropped $600 on a pro.
[01:02:41.380 --> 01:02:42.380]   Well, but they're allowing for...
[01:02:42.380 --> 01:02:45.380]   There is a lot of people who use Apple products as for those tools.
[01:02:45.380 --> 01:02:46.380]   Well, that's right.
[01:02:46.380 --> 01:02:52.380]   And that's what they're saying is the pros should stick with PowerPC and you'll be able to move when we went down the road.
[01:02:52.380 --> 01:02:53.380]   Six months.
[01:02:53.380 --> 01:02:59.380]   I got another hint of that when I talked to somebody from Apple about getting word running.
[01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:00.380]   He said it was a bear.
[01:03:00.380 --> 01:03:06.380]   I think there's a lot of tweaking that has to be done of Rosetta itself to get these programs to run.
[01:03:06.380 --> 01:03:12.380]   Just like with Wine, for instance, in order to get a program to run in Wine, you have to really kind of tweak Wine.
[01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:13.380]   I think that's probably what it is.
[01:03:13.380 --> 01:03:16.380]   In other words, it's not automatic.
[01:03:16.380 --> 01:03:18.380]   So he's got the right advice then.
[01:03:18.380 --> 01:03:20.380]   Don't buy these machines for the next...
[01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:21.380]   If you're a pro user, no.
[01:03:21.380 --> 01:03:23.380]   In fact, I was talking to Alex Lindsey.
[01:03:23.380 --> 01:03:25.380]   He said, "Well, I can't upgrade because I use Final Cut.
[01:03:25.380 --> 01:03:27.380]   It's not time to get an intel."
[01:03:27.380 --> 01:03:31.380]   But if mostly what you use is the Apple products that come with OS X.
[01:03:31.380 --> 01:03:36.380]   But he was also saying anything where timing or syncing is important.
[01:03:36.380 --> 01:03:42.380]   And this would also mean digital performer and pro tools and all these more pro stuff.
[01:03:42.380 --> 01:03:45.380]   So you're coming out publicly and saying this is a turkey.
[01:03:45.380 --> 01:03:49.380]   What's in your filter, man?
[01:03:49.380 --> 01:03:52.380]   I'm just saying coffee, baby.
[01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:57.380]   And he just liked that.
[01:03:57.380 --> 01:04:00.380]   I had a briefing with Schiller later.
[01:04:00.380 --> 01:04:02.380]   I thought I would share with the people.
[01:04:02.380 --> 01:04:04.380]   No, no, I think they're done.
[01:04:04.380 --> 01:04:05.380]   This is great.
[01:04:05.380 --> 01:04:06.380]   This is fascinating.
[01:04:06.380 --> 01:04:07.380]   Job did not say this.
[01:04:07.380 --> 01:04:14.380]   And as you just said, it's only a matter of a few months until these guys make these apps compatible with the intel processor natively.
[01:04:14.380 --> 01:04:16.380]   But for now, this is something that people should know.
[01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:19.380]   This is what speaks, though, to what Patrick was saying, which is,
[01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:23.380]   don't be the first to buy this thing, wait and see what these little issues are.
[01:04:23.380 --> 01:04:27.380]   But what these little issues are, because there may well be more issues, and now already we're hearing,
[01:04:27.380 --> 01:04:33.380]   well, yeah, a lot of programs won't run on the intel, a lot of Mac programs won't run on the intel Macs.
[01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:34.380]   That's a big deal.
[01:04:34.380 --> 01:04:38.380]   Yeah, but Steve did say we are going to port all our professional apps.
[01:04:38.380 --> 01:04:39.380]   I can't buy March.
[01:04:39.380 --> 01:04:42.380]   March, so that's not terribly far away.
[01:04:42.380 --> 01:04:46.380]   So you'll have Final Cut, you'll have Logic and I can't remember what the other ones are.
[01:04:46.380 --> 01:04:49.380]   Right, well, that's why I was going to point.
[01:04:49.380 --> 01:04:52.380]   Why a copy of XP Pro and dual boot?
[01:04:52.380 --> 01:04:56.380]   Well, there was one Pro app that I use, which is soundtrack Pro.
[01:04:56.380 --> 01:05:01.380]   It sounds like that will not run if I get one of the new Macs that will not run well, because that's very timing specific.
[01:05:01.380 --> 01:05:03.380]   Any music program, it sounds like whatever trouble.
[01:05:03.380 --> 01:05:04.380]   Sounds like.
[01:05:04.380 --> 01:05:08.380]   Yeah, but just, yeah, that was just the one last thing, and I'll leave you alone.
[01:05:08.380 --> 01:05:15.380]   But, you know, Mac world is usually attuned to the consumer apps and consumer computers and all that.
[01:05:15.380 --> 01:05:16.380]   And so...
[01:05:16.380 --> 01:05:17.380]   That's what we saw tonight.
[01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:26.380]   Right, and so basically when we start seeing these Pro machines, that's where we'll probably see the kick for the software, which is why he mentioned the cross-grade, but like 149 per app.
[01:05:26.380 --> 01:05:27.380]   49 bucks.
[01:05:27.380 --> 01:05:28.380]   49.
[01:05:28.380 --> 01:05:29.380]   49.
[01:05:29.380 --> 01:05:30.380]   Okay, shoot.
[01:05:30.380 --> 01:05:31.380]   That's a good deal.
[01:05:31.380 --> 01:05:35.380]   I mean, if you're a final, I mean, I guess it is, you already paid $18,000 for the program.
[01:05:35.380 --> 01:05:36.380]   Okay.
[01:05:36.380 --> 01:05:40.380]   And I just wanted to give a shout out to the Macadict people who told me to come here.
[01:05:40.380 --> 01:05:41.380]   So Macadict?
[01:05:41.380 --> 01:05:42.380]   Macadict?
[01:05:42.380 --> 01:05:43.380]   Macadict forms?
[01:05:43.380 --> 01:05:44.380]   Macadict.
[01:05:44.380 --> 01:05:45.380]   I can't pronounce it.
[01:05:45.380 --> 01:05:46.380]   You had it on the wrong syllable.
[01:05:46.380 --> 01:05:47.380]   Okay.
[01:05:47.380 --> 01:05:48.380]   Are you from Canada?
[01:05:48.380 --> 01:05:49.380]   Easy, easy.
[01:05:49.380 --> 01:05:50.380]   Macadict.
[01:05:50.380 --> 01:05:51.380]   Macadict.
[01:05:51.380 --> 01:05:52.380]   Thank you.
[01:05:52.380 --> 01:05:53.380]   I want to get.
[01:05:53.380 --> 01:05:55.380]   Sounds like some sort of a... sounds lewd.
[01:05:55.380 --> 01:05:56.380]   It does sound lewd.
[01:05:56.380 --> 01:05:59.380]   And now I am with the Macadict.
[01:05:59.380 --> 01:06:01.380]   Is that Victor?
[01:06:01.380 --> 01:06:02.380]   Yeah.
[01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:03.380]   Hey, Victor.
[01:06:03.380 --> 01:06:04.380]   Hi.
[01:06:04.380 --> 01:06:09.380]   So, just beating up a load of horse here and I went.
[01:06:09.380 --> 01:06:15.380]   I just wondered how are these faces you're going to show up on a Windows PC and not exploring,
[01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:16.380]   you know?
[01:06:16.380 --> 01:06:17.380]   That's a good question.
[01:06:17.380 --> 01:06:19.380]   A lot like Dreamweaver in the whole day.
[01:06:19.380 --> 01:06:21.380]   It was like, oh, you can just drag your photos over here.
[01:06:21.380 --> 01:06:25.380]   It's going to show up fine and then press F12 and it looks like trash.
[01:06:25.380 --> 01:06:27.380]   I think Steve addressed it in the key.
[01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:29.380]   We're final safari, but when I said...
[01:06:29.380 --> 01:06:31.380]   I think Steve addressed that in the key note and he said it works well.
[01:06:31.380 --> 01:06:34.380]   In fact, he said Internet Explorer specifically as well as Firefox.
[01:06:34.380 --> 01:06:35.380]   And he said Firefox as well.
[01:06:35.380 --> 01:06:40.380]   I think he said any modern browser, which means it's using a lot of CSS, I would imagine.
[01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:42.380]   Can Ajax as well?
[01:06:42.380 --> 01:06:43.380]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:06:43.380 --> 01:06:48.380]   Because whenever you try to make a page, it's how to make it work well and every...
[01:06:48.380 --> 01:06:54.380]   Well, and that's something that Dreamweaver does very well, which is does browser checking and makes sure that it degrades properly and so forth.
[01:06:54.380 --> 01:06:56.380]   So the Java back and makes everything a gel.
[01:06:56.380 --> 01:06:57.380]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:06:57.380 --> 01:06:59.380]   It puts a lot of Java in there saying, what's the browser?
[01:06:59.380 --> 01:07:00.380]   Alright, I can't do this.
[01:07:00.380 --> 01:07:01.380]   I can't do that.
[01:07:01.380 --> 01:07:08.380]   The first thing is they're still selling like PowerBooks for the same price and the 15 PowerBooks is the same price as the 15 PowerBooks.
[01:07:08.380 --> 01:07:09.380]   I think it's a great deal.
[01:07:09.380 --> 01:07:11.380]   It's five times faster.
[01:07:11.380 --> 01:07:14.380]   So I wonder what do you guys think about that?
[01:07:14.380 --> 01:07:16.380]   Why are they still selling the PowerBooks at the same price?
[01:07:16.380 --> 01:07:19.380]   But are you on the raised price or do we know what?
[01:07:19.380 --> 01:07:22.380]   Oh, by the way, it's 98 where you've said Ajax.
[01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:25.380]   (Laughter)
[01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:27.380]   Patrick, I noticed...
[01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:30.380]   Along those lines, Patrick, he used the spec benchmarks.
[01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:32.380]   He used spec in and spec floating point.
[01:07:32.380 --> 01:07:34.380]   Those are synthetic benchmarks.
[01:07:34.380 --> 01:07:35.380]   Are they considered...
[01:07:35.380 --> 01:07:38.380]   Well, there's some that use applications, right?
[01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:43.380]   Yeah, I mean, even application based benchmarks can be spun into weeks.
[01:07:43.380 --> 01:07:47.380]   spec is not what I would call a...
[01:07:47.380 --> 01:07:49.380]   Or is it a good, useful benchmark?
[01:07:49.380 --> 01:07:50.380]   Well, okay, I think about this way.
[01:07:50.380 --> 01:07:53.380]   You can build a car and run it in the quarter mile, right?
[01:07:53.380 --> 01:08:00.380]   Or you can take the engine out and put it on a machine and run it that way, right?
[01:08:00.380 --> 01:08:02.380]   And you can guesstimate the horsepower either way.
[01:08:02.380 --> 01:08:06.380]   You can get the horsepower off a dyno and you've got a great number for horsepower.
[01:08:06.380 --> 01:08:09.380]   But if you change settings on the dyno or settings...
[01:08:09.380 --> 01:08:11.380]   That's essentially what the spec is doing.
[01:08:11.380 --> 01:08:12.380]   Yeah, the spec is like a dyno number.
[01:08:12.380 --> 01:08:15.380]   It's like, "Ooh, it's 100% more dead crap."
[01:08:15.380 --> 01:08:16.380]   Great.
[01:08:16.380 --> 01:08:19.380]   And it seems credit, he said, but now that's not the full power of this machine because
[01:08:19.380 --> 01:08:20.380]   these hard drives aren't faster or so.
[01:08:20.380 --> 01:08:25.380]   So do you think that Steve maybe would use benchmarks that made his stuff look better?
[01:08:25.380 --> 01:08:26.380]   Maybe.
[01:08:26.380 --> 01:08:33.380]   Well, there's a long history in every hardware manufacturer on the planet of spinning things
[01:08:33.380 --> 01:08:34.380]   as best they can.
[01:08:34.380 --> 01:08:35.380]   Really?
[01:08:35.380 --> 01:08:36.380]   It's true, Jeff.
[01:08:36.380 --> 01:08:38.380]   That's why when I used it and it felt so much faster.
[01:08:38.380 --> 01:08:39.380]   I was just going to say, that's the real test.
[01:08:39.380 --> 01:08:40.380]   None of this makes any difference.
[01:08:40.380 --> 01:08:42.380]   All you have to do is pick up the mouse and try it.
[01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:44.380]   And you're like, "Wow, this is fast."
[01:08:44.380 --> 01:08:48.380]   I've always believed that the best way to tell is when you feel if it's faster.
[01:08:48.380 --> 01:08:49.380]   And it does.
[01:08:49.380 --> 01:08:52.380]   And I've always felt it was the better benchmark.
[01:08:52.380 --> 01:08:53.380]   The emphatic numbers.
[01:08:53.380 --> 01:08:54.380]   It emphatically feels faster.
[01:08:54.380 --> 01:08:56.380]   The web stuff is unbelievable.
[01:08:56.380 --> 01:08:58.380]   And I asked Phil, my buddy Phil.
[01:08:58.380 --> 01:08:59.380]   I'm Web-or.
[01:08:59.380 --> 01:09:01.380]   Not Web-Bari.
[01:09:01.380 --> 01:09:04.380]   The Web-Book-Kuduo-Kor.
[01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:08.380]   And like he demoed in the keynote, pages just blink onto the screen.
[01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:11.380]   I was typing URLs, I knew he hadn't been cash with CNN.com.
[01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:16.380]   And I thought that a lot of that would have to do with the connection and the hard drive
[01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:18.380]   and the cash and all that stuff.
[01:09:18.380 --> 01:09:23.380]   He said there's so much actual processing, Java and whatnot, that it actually makes a big
[01:09:23.380 --> 01:09:24.380]   speed difference.
[01:09:24.380 --> 01:09:27.380]   And those previous systems must have been slow as dirt.
[01:09:27.380 --> 01:09:30.380]   Chris Breen, did you notice, I noticed this in the keynote.
[01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:34.380]   In fact, right at the beginning I said he's using an iMac.
[01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:39.380]   And this is the fastest, I said, there must be something, there's a cray underneath the desk.
[01:09:39.380 --> 01:09:43.380]   It didn't, I mean immediately I noticed that what's going on.
[01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:47.380]   Well yeah, and that's when I suspected they're running the mail just popped up.
[01:09:47.380 --> 01:09:52.380]   I mean anytime Steve does anything it's never slow unless he wants it to be.
[01:09:52.380 --> 01:09:55.380]   So invariably they're running some kind of hardware.
[01:09:55.380 --> 01:09:59.380]   So yeah, I suspect that they were running a new Intel machine of some kind.
[01:09:59.380 --> 01:10:02.380]   I was far enough back that I couldn't see exactly what he was doing there.
[01:10:02.380 --> 01:10:09.380]   But particularly when he brought out the new iPhoto and had 25,000 things and it liked butter.
[01:10:09.380 --> 01:10:10.380]   And it really loved butter.
[01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:12.380]   It's scrolled like butter.
[01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:13.380]   It's scrolled like butter because it's...
[01:10:13.380 --> 01:10:14.380]   That's a t-shirt people.
[01:10:14.380 --> 01:10:20.380]   So we have another smaller element here that's going to ask the question.
[01:10:20.380 --> 01:10:23.380]   A little, a little twit, a little, little baby click.
[01:10:23.380 --> 01:10:27.380]   Like on all the rumor sites they said, oh they're going to update the iBook and the Mac Mini
[01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:29.380]   first with the Intel processors.
[01:10:29.380 --> 01:10:30.380]   But why didn't they do that?
[01:10:30.380 --> 01:10:34.380]   And it seems like Apple would want to do that first just kind of ease into the transition.
[01:10:34.380 --> 01:10:39.380]   But the power book is more the pro laptop and the iMacs kind of mid range.
[01:10:39.380 --> 01:10:41.380]   So why did they do you have any idea why they did that?
[01:10:41.380 --> 01:10:44.380]   They basically just wanted to teach the rumor sites a lesson.
[01:10:44.380 --> 01:10:45.380]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:10:45.380 --> 01:10:46.380]   [applause]
[01:10:46.380 --> 01:10:49.380]   Actually, they're actually behind the corner.
[01:10:49.380 --> 01:10:50.380]   [applause]
[01:10:50.380 --> 01:10:52.380]   No, I have a thought on this.
[01:10:52.380 --> 01:10:53.380]   [laughter]
[01:10:53.380 --> 01:10:56.380]   Somebody asked us asked what's your podcast kid?
[01:10:56.380 --> 01:11:02.380]   So Jeffrey, I think that what you see is Steve Jobs is kind of a guy who likes repeat success.
[01:11:02.380 --> 01:11:06.380]   And when he took the company over again, the first thing he came out was with an iMac.
[01:11:06.380 --> 01:11:08.380]   And so I think he's just basically doing...
[01:11:08.380 --> 01:11:09.380]   Interesting.
[01:11:09.380 --> 01:11:11.380]   So he's following the same pattern he did before.
[01:11:11.380 --> 01:11:13.380]   That little one will come out last.
[01:11:13.380 --> 01:11:14.380]   Okay.
[01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:15.380]   Mac Mini.
[01:11:15.380 --> 01:11:16.380]   Do you have a podcast, Jeffrey?
[01:11:16.380 --> 01:11:19.380]   Well, me and my friend used to do it in a long time.
[01:11:19.380 --> 01:11:21.380]   A long time ago.
[01:11:21.380 --> 01:11:23.380]   When he was three!
[01:11:23.380 --> 01:11:24.380]   [applause]
[01:11:24.380 --> 01:11:26.380]   Early days of the podcast.
[01:11:26.380 --> 01:11:27.380]   [laughter]
[01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:30.380]   Yeah, he's beyond it now.
[01:11:30.380 --> 01:11:31.380]   [laughter]
[01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:32.380]   What have you moved on to?
[01:11:32.380 --> 01:11:34.380]   Because I'd like to know because I want to get into it.
[01:11:34.380 --> 01:11:36.380]   Now he runs kitty soft.
[01:11:36.380 --> 01:11:37.380]   [laughter]
[01:11:37.380 --> 01:11:41.380]   Well, my friend really likes RuneScape.
[01:11:41.380 --> 01:11:43.380]   So it's more his podcast than mine.
[01:11:43.380 --> 01:11:45.380]   So I just kind of set it up for him.
[01:11:45.380 --> 01:11:46.380]   [laughter]
[01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:47.380]   [applause]
[01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:51.380]   So what you're saying is you're a producer more than talent.
[01:11:51.380 --> 01:11:52.380]   Get him a t-shirt.
[01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:53.380]   [laughter]
[01:11:53.380 --> 01:11:55.380]   Can you come over and set up my home theater?
[01:11:55.380 --> 01:11:56.380]   [laughter]
[01:11:56.380 --> 01:11:57.380]   [laughter]
[01:11:57.380 --> 01:11:58.380]   [indistinct]
[01:11:58.380 --> 01:11:59.380]   [indistinct]
[01:11:59.380 --> 01:12:00.380]   [indistinct]
[01:12:00.380 --> 01:12:01.380]   [laughter]
[01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:02.380]   Thanks Jeffrey.
[01:12:02.380 --> 01:12:03.380]   We appreciate it.
[01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:08.380]   [applause]
[01:12:08.380 --> 01:12:11.380]   15 years from now we'll be working for him.
[01:12:11.380 --> 01:12:13.380]   Yeah, maybe sooner.
[01:12:13.380 --> 01:12:14.380]   I know.
[01:12:14.380 --> 01:12:16.380]   So I did actually, we did,
[01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:20.380]   Amber and I talked to the Mac Mini product manager
[01:12:20.380 --> 01:12:23.380]   and asked him actually that very question.
[01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:24.380]   And he didn't say anything.
[01:12:24.380 --> 01:12:25.380]   [laughter]
[01:12:25.380 --> 01:12:27.380]   Is he really, really little?
[01:12:27.380 --> 01:12:28.380]   [laughter]
[01:12:28.380 --> 01:12:29.380]   He's tiny.
[01:12:29.380 --> 01:12:30.380]   You know what's interesting?
[01:12:30.380 --> 01:12:32.380]   He actually used to work at Shuttle PC until January
[01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:34.380]   which is another actually very cool,
[01:12:34.380 --> 01:12:36.380]   it's the only cool PC really, it's a little box PC.
[01:12:36.380 --> 01:12:37.380]   And obviously Apple said,
[01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:40.380]   "We're going to do a little computer you want to come over."
[01:12:40.380 --> 01:12:41.380]   [laughter]
[01:12:41.380 --> 01:12:46.380]   But I would say it's pretty clear that that's the next kind of media center.
[01:12:46.380 --> 01:12:48.380]   I think there's still a full speed ahead on that.
[01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:50.380]   I think it's a pretty typical move for most,
[01:12:50.380 --> 01:12:52.380]   anytime you're going to launch a new chip like that,
[01:12:52.380 --> 01:12:54.380]   you want to show off its best side and fastest hardware
[01:12:54.380 --> 01:12:56.380]   and obviously was needed.
[01:12:56.380 --> 01:12:57.380]   And it's good to see.
[01:12:57.380 --> 01:12:59.380]   I mean everyone sounds pleased with the performance.
[01:12:59.380 --> 01:13:01.380]   You guys sound like you're really excited about it.
[01:13:01.380 --> 01:13:02.380]   I'm the only thing that kills me.
[01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:04.380]   I have a dual 2 GHz tower.
[01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:06.380]   And now it's all you've been complaining about the whole chip.
[01:13:06.380 --> 01:13:07.380]   Have I already said that?
[01:13:07.380 --> 01:13:09.380]   You're trying to give it away.
[01:13:09.380 --> 01:13:10.380]   Get your book or something.
[01:13:10.380 --> 01:13:12.380]   But there's been a crying need for,
[01:13:12.380 --> 01:13:15.380]   I mean people on the max side have been crying about
[01:13:15.380 --> 01:13:17.380]   the power books power for a long time.
[01:13:17.380 --> 01:13:19.380]   And it's sort of that,
[01:13:19.380 --> 01:13:21.380]   the pro users who are portable people have seen.
[01:13:21.380 --> 01:13:25.380]   We really have got to have this and we're never going to put a G5 in this.
[01:13:25.380 --> 01:13:26.380]   So please, please, please.
[01:13:26.380 --> 01:13:29.380]   And I think Apple really wanted to live on the high end in the portable side.
[01:13:29.380 --> 01:13:31.380]   So I think...
[01:13:31.380 --> 01:13:32.380]   Well they will.
[01:13:32.380 --> 01:13:35.380]   I mean the iBook users don't care quite so much.
[01:13:35.380 --> 01:13:37.380]   They don't have to be as fast as possible.
[01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:39.380]   But the people that are buying the professional portable do.
[01:13:39.380 --> 01:13:43.380]   Seriously Leo, you have about 3 days to get that thing up on eBay.
[01:13:43.380 --> 01:13:44.380]   I know, I'm moving.
[01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:45.380]   I know it's going to drop off.
[01:13:45.380 --> 01:13:49.380]   You know one of the reasons that I was about to get on the ledge, John,
[01:13:49.380 --> 01:13:53.380]   when they announced the Intel thing was I thought of the Osborne effect.
[01:13:53.380 --> 01:13:56.380]   I thought they'll never sell another Apple.
[01:13:56.380 --> 01:13:58.380]   You know, until they come out with the Intel's.
[01:13:58.380 --> 01:13:59.380]   And that's not so.
[01:13:59.380 --> 01:14:02.380]   In fact, they had the biggest quarter in Apple history last quarter.
[01:14:02.380 --> 01:14:05.380]   They sold more product, not less product.
[01:14:05.380 --> 01:14:07.380]   What do you attribute to that one?
[01:14:07.380 --> 01:14:08.380]   I can't believe that was the idea.
[01:14:08.380 --> 01:14:11.380]   Well, no, no, I think he's talking about Mac sales as well.
[01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:12.380]   We're up.
[01:14:12.380 --> 01:14:15.380]   It's the iPod.
[01:14:15.380 --> 01:14:16.380]   He sold a lot of Mac.
[01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:18.380]   I think they said it was a large...
[01:14:18.380 --> 01:14:20.380]   Oh well, I can't read your transcript.
[01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:22.380]   Also the thing about all these transcripts.
[01:14:22.380 --> 01:14:24.380]   I've heard that a lot today.
[01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:25.380]   In fact...
[01:14:25.380 --> 01:14:27.380]   There was no Osborne effect apparently.
[01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:29.380]   And there isn't one because think about it.
[01:14:29.380 --> 01:14:33.380]   Let's say you're one of these people who says, "Oh, I like that new power book.
[01:14:33.380 --> 01:14:35.380]   I'm not going to buy a power book now."
[01:14:35.380 --> 01:14:36.380]   So it was like, "Ooh, Apple's dead.
[01:14:36.380 --> 01:14:39.380]   They're not going to sell any power books until this one comes out in March."
[01:14:39.380 --> 01:14:40.380]   Right?
[01:14:40.380 --> 01:14:41.380]   So...
[01:14:41.380 --> 01:14:42.380]   But it's just a delayed purchase.
[01:14:42.380 --> 01:14:44.380]   Then when it comes to March, they will buy it.
[01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:46.380]   So I don't understand what the big fuss is.
[01:14:46.380 --> 01:14:49.380]   It's not like people are switching to Windows because it's going to take two more months.
[01:14:49.380 --> 01:14:52.380]   I think I've been totally convinced that that Osborne effect actually existed.
[01:14:52.380 --> 01:14:55.380]   It happened with Osborne because the product that they announced,
[01:14:55.380 --> 01:14:57.380]   they didn't get out in time.
[01:14:57.380 --> 01:14:59.380]   I mean, they had all this announcement.
[01:14:59.380 --> 01:15:02.380]   And there was also a lot of competition that they were facing.
[01:15:02.380 --> 01:15:03.380]   I'm not absolutely sure.
[01:15:03.380 --> 01:15:07.380]   I know what the Osborne effect is supposed to be, which for people out there who were just listening now,
[01:15:07.380 --> 01:15:13.380]   and this actually the real time that this happened was with North Star computers some years earlier
[01:15:13.380 --> 01:15:17.380]   when they announced a double density controller card at the same exact price...
[01:15:17.380 --> 01:15:18.380]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:15:18.380 --> 01:15:22.380]   At the same exact price as the single density card, but they couldn't ship it.
[01:15:22.380 --> 01:15:24.380]   But people stopped buying the single density card and say,
[01:15:24.380 --> 01:15:26.380]   "Why am I going to just wait for the double?"
[01:15:26.380 --> 01:15:27.380]   It's the same price.
[01:15:27.380 --> 01:15:29.380]   And the company almost went broke.
[01:15:29.380 --> 01:15:33.380]   And this has since become the Osborne effect because he did something similar.
[01:15:33.380 --> 01:15:34.380]   It really did go broke.
[01:15:34.380 --> 01:15:36.380]   But they didn't have any other products either.
[01:15:36.380 --> 01:15:38.380]   I mean, Apple, if they stopped selling all the other stuff,
[01:15:38.380 --> 01:15:40.380]   they could just coast on their iPod sale.
[01:15:40.380 --> 01:15:42.380]   So I mean, it's not going to really hurt the company.
[01:15:42.380 --> 01:15:43.380]   I'd like to get the gentleman brought up.
[01:15:43.380 --> 01:15:46.380]   Isn't the pricing right now the same as the previous hardware?
[01:15:46.380 --> 01:15:51.380]   So that right then and there, it's like, okay, I'm going to get something that's twice as fast as you guys are saying.
[01:15:51.380 --> 01:15:52.380]   That's pretty good.
[01:15:52.380 --> 01:15:53.380]   That's pretty good.
[01:15:53.380 --> 01:15:54.380]   I'm waiting.
[01:15:54.380 --> 01:15:55.380]   Yeah.
[01:15:55.380 --> 01:15:56.380]   Yeah.
[01:15:56.380 --> 01:15:57.380]   And this is awesome.
[01:15:57.380 --> 01:15:58.380]   The first time I actually considered it.
[01:15:58.380 --> 01:16:00.380]   Apple was up $4 a share today.
[01:16:00.380 --> 01:16:01.380]   So what?
[01:16:01.380 --> 01:16:02.380]   To what?
[01:16:02.380 --> 01:16:03.380]   To what?
[01:16:03.380 --> 01:16:04.380]   To what?
[01:16:04.380 --> 01:16:05.380]   To what?

[01:16:09.380 --> 01:16:10.380]   To what?
[01:16:10.380 --> 01:16:11.380]   To what?

[01:16:38.380 --> 01:16:39.380]   To what?
[01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:40.380]   To what?
[01:16:40.380 --> 01:16:41.380]   To what?
