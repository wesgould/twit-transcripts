[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.320]   We're going to talk about what else.
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.360]   What Apple's going to do on Tuesday, what happened with Equifax.
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:19.120]   Oh my gosh.

[00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.720]   This week in Tech, the show where we get together with some of the smartest people in technology,
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.600]   the tech journalists par excellence.
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:06.280]   Let's talk about the week's tech news.
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:08.720]   And in this case, a little bit about what's ahead.
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:14.240]   Philip Elmer DeWitt is here, the senior elder statesman of Macintosh journalism.
[00:02:14.240 --> 00:02:15.240]   I'm sorry, Phil.
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:18.240]   I'm older every time.
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.960]   I was 68 this week.
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:21.360]   Wow, I'm really good.
[00:02:21.360 --> 00:02:23.760]   Wow, that is old.
[00:02:23.760 --> 00:02:29.080]   PED30 is his blog, ped30.com.
[00:02:29.080 --> 00:02:30.480]   And you can follow him on the Twitter.
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:36.320]   He's a Philip with 1L, Philip, PED, or Philip Ed.
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:39.080]   And you're getting ready to go to the Apple event on Tuesday.
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.200]   So we'll talk a little bit about that in a moment.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:46.200]   I want to welcome two new members to our Twit team, and I'm thrilled to have them.
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:48.400]   I've been fans for a long time of both.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:50.360]   Ben Johnson is here.
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:51.840]   You've seen him on Marketplace.
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.080]   He was the tech editor there.
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.920]   He's the creator of the Code Breaker podcast.
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:03:00.560]   And you may remember, we were in hot pursuit of Code Breaker for the Webby.
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:02.680]   You got the People's Choice Award.
[00:03:02.680 --> 00:03:03.680]   We shared it.
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:04.680]   A handful of us.
[00:03:04.680 --> 00:03:06.680]   Was a friendly competition.
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:07.680]   We loved it.
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:10.160]   Great to have you, Ben.
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:12.840]   Why is your Twitter handle, Philip Brock Johnson?
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:15.160]   Who's this Brock Johnson that we talk of?
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:21.360]   Well, Brock is my middle name, but for a long time, my nickname was the Brock Johnson because
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.680]   of our next president, Dwayne the Rock Johnson.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:26.600]   Oh, I get it.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:30.760]   So you know, the B version of the rock.
[00:03:30.760 --> 00:03:32.320]   I get it.
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:33.920]   Anyway, great to have you.
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:42.880]   I ran into Ben at the podcast movement to the big podcast conference.
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:46.680]   I'm sure they'll edit all that out and fix this in post.
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:47.680]   No.
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:50.600]   In Anaheim a few weeks ago, it was great to see you.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:52.080]   And I thought, we got to get you on the show.
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:53.680]   So I'm thrilled to have you.
[00:03:53.680 --> 00:03:54.680]   Thanks for having me.
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:03:55.880]   Big, long time fan, first time calling.
[00:03:55.880 --> 00:03:56.880]   Thank you.
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:03:59.680]   And you'll have some announcements on Monday about the new thing because Molly Wood has
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:02.720]   taken over your role at Marketplace, which is great.
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.720]   Yes.
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:04.720]   The Molly Wood.
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:05.720]   We love her.
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.360]   I don't think that's her Twitter handle, but yeah, sure.
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.440]   Her Twitter handle is perfect.
[00:04:09.440 --> 00:04:12.160]   It's Molly Wood, which is perfect.
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:18.320]   You know, Holly with an M also thrilled to welcome Aunt Pruitt, who has been on, of course,
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:19.320]   TNT many times.
[00:04:19.320 --> 00:04:24.760]   He's writer at Tech Republic photographer and a famous drone flyer.
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:26.560]   And great to have you.
[00:04:26.560 --> 00:04:27.960]   Hey, thank you, Mr. LaPray.
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:30.120]   I really, really appreciate you having me.
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:31.880]   He's got a Clemson tiger behind him.
[00:04:31.880 --> 00:04:34.880]   So I have a feeling we know where he's sipping things like.
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:35.880]   It's great to have you.
[00:04:35.880 --> 00:04:38.520]   I also see a line drawing of somebody.
[00:04:38.520 --> 00:04:41.400]   Is that you or is that your dad?
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:46.200]   That is me, one of my great friends, readers, followers over in Sweden.
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:49.200]   She drew that as well as another one on my wall.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:53.240]   It's just she's so talented and it really warmed my heart to have someone send that
[00:04:53.240 --> 00:04:54.240]   to me.
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.720]   And I want to apologize for my voice for the listeners because as you said, I'm a tiger
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:04:59.720]   fan.
[00:04:59.720 --> 00:05:02.200]   I actually go to the games and I yell.
[00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:05.160]   So I'm going to sound a little bit like very white.
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:08.560]   Actually, I will try to see that with some whiskey.
[00:05:08.560 --> 00:05:09.960]   Good thinking.
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:10.960]   People don't know.
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:16.360]   And is actually a tenor.
[00:05:16.360 --> 00:05:17.800]   So I have to start.
[00:05:17.800 --> 00:05:19.960]   I'm sorry to say with a set on a sad note.
[00:05:19.960 --> 00:05:24.320]   And I think people are starting to just learn the news.
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:30.320]   One of our longtime friends, man who's been on 20 times, we did two triangulations with
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:31.320]   him.
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.760]   The great science fiction author Jerry Pournell passed away on Friday.
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:36.120]   Jerry went to DragonCon.
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:38.080]   Atlanta had a great time.
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:45.040]   His son Alex wrote on the Chaos Manor blog that Jerry had a wonderful time at Dragon
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:46.040]  Con.
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:51.080]   He felt a little ill, maybe the flu or a cold and came home.
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.480]   And on Friday, he passed away quietly and without pain.
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:06:00.120]   So we're very sorry to lose Jerry Pournell, an inspiration for my career with his Chaos
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:02.320]   Manor column in Bite Magazine.
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:07.280]   The first, as best we can tell, first guy ever to write a novel on a computer.
[00:06:07.280 --> 00:06:11.280]   He wrote many great science fiction novels, including some with Larry Niven that are absolute
[00:06:11.280 --> 00:06:14.760]   classics like The Moten God's Eye and Lucifer's Hammer.
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:20.680]   And I want to thank our team who jumped on this and pulled some clips from Jerry's many
[00:06:20.680 --> 00:06:22.120]   appearances on our shows.
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:29.200]   And we made a little kind of tribute reel to Jerry Pournell.
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:33.800]   Our guest today is somebody that I have, I've been a fan of literally for years ever
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.640]   since his column in Bite Magazine.
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:37.840]   And he certainly influenced my career.
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.280]   Let's welcome Jerry Pournell.
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:45.200]   A lot of people couldn't figure out why in the world was I better known than anybody else
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:48.200]   in a computer business, maybe the war.
[00:06:48.200 --> 00:06:50.160]   I wrote the Field and Stream column.
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:51.560]   Lee and Joe went hunting.
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.680]   Well, me and old Zeke went compute.
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:57.360]   And that was the great secret I never told anybody.
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:03.440]   Great many, if not most, scientists were heavily influenced by sci-fi and focused their research
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:09.040]   on areas that science fiction inspired them to study, which is why, in so many ways, modern
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:13.000]   scientific advances parallel what you guys were writing about.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:19.200]   When you get around to listening to The Moten God's Eye, pay attention to the pocket computer.
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:24.520]   I wrote that in 1972, and iPhone does most of what it says in there.
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:30.360]   But of course we had to set it a long way away because even in 1972, nobody thought
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:31.880]   that I would live to see.
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:32.880]   Isn't it amazing?
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:38.560]   Most of the people in this world accept fruits of technology in about the same way as a kitten
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:42.240]   accepts milk when you pour it into a bowl for it.
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:46.080]   There was a common phrase in the robot industry.
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:52.880]   You never understand how smart a moron is until you try to program a robot.
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:58.480]   It towards the end of the Soviet Union and Panoevich, which was doing the handwriting
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:01.240]   recognition software for Microsoft.
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:08.080]   He said, "My biggest problem is I don't have enough technical handwriting than I got my
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.080]   log book out."
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:14.680]   That's the technical handwriting that was the standard.
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:20.680]   And that engine has been in every edition of a Microsoft handwriting recognition program
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:22.160]   since 1990.
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.920]   How is your handwriting, Jerry?
[00:08:23.920 --> 00:08:24.920]   It's god awful.
[00:08:24.920 --> 00:08:27.400]   It's really terrible.
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:28.960]   X projects are this.
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:35.080]   Go out to some place like Edwards or some awful place where nobody wants to be.
[00:08:35.080 --> 00:08:40.800]   Go out there and you tell them, "I want you to build the best whatever it is you can build
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:43.920]   with technology as of this afternoon."
[00:08:43.920 --> 00:08:45.680]   You build three copies of it.
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.960]   We test one to the edge of it and we're probably praying it.
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:53.800]   The second one we fly because we learn from the first until we get all the information
[00:08:53.800 --> 00:08:54.800]   out of it.
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:08:56.800]   The third one ends up in the Smithsonian.
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:09:00.480]   Yeah, Jerry's the wording one.
[00:09:00.480 --> 00:09:04.040]   I, Larry, has told a perfectly good story.
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:06.680]   It would be publishable now.
[00:09:06.680 --> 00:09:12.720]   But when I'm finished with it, it will be probably half again, maybe twice as long.
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:17.360]   And then he goes over it and finds some scene that what everybody will remember and they'll
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:19.680]   forget that I ever had any further.
[00:09:19.680 --> 00:09:20.680]   What the hell?
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:24.200]   I've always been an operation research guy, you know.
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:30.400]   That's a guy who knows less and less about more and more until he knows nothing at all
[00:09:30.400 --> 00:09:32.800]   about everything.
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:33.800]   One last question.
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:34.800]   You ever going to write your memoir?
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.720]   Maybe I'll ruin a sense of writing it now, aren't I?
[00:09:37.720 --> 00:09:39.520]   Maybe after a year or two we'd have the whole thing.
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:40.520]   No.
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:41.520]   Maybe take a little longer than that.
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:46.160]   Anybody you know whose personal computer has been on display in the Smithsonian.
[00:09:46.160 --> 00:09:48.320]   You're the only one I know of.
[00:09:48.320 --> 00:09:50.360]   Yeah, probably I'll have a few.
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:57.520]   I know all of them.
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:04.280]   Great Dr. Jerry Purnell was an honor to consider him a friend who will miss him.
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:05.800]   Thank you, Jerry.
[00:10:05.800 --> 00:10:13.240]   And Godspeed on to the tech news of the week and I guess Tuesdays the big day.
[00:10:13.240 --> 00:10:16.640]   You're coming out of Philip Elmer to it for the event.
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:20.740]   I'm very jealous because this will be the first event Apple will hold at its new Apple
[00:10:20.740 --> 00:10:27.080]   Park campus in the aptly named Steve Jobs Theater.
[00:10:27.080 --> 00:10:34.080]   Yeah, and I've got to apologize for what's going to be a humble brag.
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:37.940]   You know, where you say, "Geez, I went to the White House and all I got was these stupid
[00:10:37.940 --> 00:10:39.640]   matches."
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:45.120]   So I got wind, like everybody else, that it was probably going to be September 12th
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:48.960]   and I started worrying about airline prices going up.
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.960]   Because they never tell you at a time.
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:54.160]   I mean, give you as little warning as possible.
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:55.160]   Right.
[00:10:55.160 --> 00:10:57.560]   But there was some, you know, you could sort of start putting it together.
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:00.600]   They weren't going to do it the day after Labor Day and I think maybe the Wall Street
[00:11:00.600 --> 00:11:02.080]   Journal leaked it.
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:09.000]   So I bought my ticket and I rented my car and I arranged a place to stay.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.960]   And then the invitations came out and I didn't get one.
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:19.920]   So I spent, I don't know, 12 hours, first of all, feeling horrible and forgotten and
[00:11:19.920 --> 00:11:21.320]   unloved.
[00:11:21.320 --> 00:11:27.400]   And then I started composing my mind the story about trying to guess which Apple exec I had
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:31.400]   so pissed off that they had dropped me off the list.
[00:11:31.400 --> 00:11:35.640]   And then I thought rather than do that, why don't I just reach out to my friend who's
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:39.480]   the head of PR and see if, you know, and I wrote him, I said, you know, maybe it was
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.080]   an oversight.
[00:11:41.080 --> 00:11:43.480]   And he said, yeah, maybe it was and he sent me an invite.
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:50.200]   So they kept a few extras for the people like you who they missed.
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:51.200]   I hope so.
[00:11:51.200 --> 00:11:56.920]   I can't think they zeroed out a list.
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:57.920]   Start from scratch.
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:04.320]   Yeah, and waited to see who screamed the loudest or frozen seats in the Steve Jobs Theater.
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:09.720]   But according to their environmental impact report, this is a tidbit.
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:11.040]   Only three.
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:13.200]   I don't know why this is in the EIR.
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.200]   Don't worry.
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:20.040]   No more than 350 journalists will ever be allowed on the campus at the same time.
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:21.200]   Yes.
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:22.560]   So there weren't that many seats.
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:23.920]   There were only 350 seats.
[00:12:23.920 --> 00:12:26.880]   I didn't get invited, but I didn't expect to get invited.
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:29.960]   Renee Ritchie, who's one of our hosts of MacBreak Weekly, will be there.
[00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:36.840]   I think a couple of people from his publication, iMore.com will be there.
[00:12:36.840 --> 00:12:41.600]   But it's, you know, I think increasingly, Apple wants to save those seats for Apple staff.
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:48.440]   But they need a certain volume because there are these applause lines.
[00:12:48.440 --> 00:12:49.440]   Exactly.
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:53.560]   And if it's just a roomful of journalists, there'll be silence because, you know, the tradition
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:12:56.560]   is you're not, you're not, you're not there to cheerlead.
[00:12:56.560 --> 00:12:58.160]   You're there to type.
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:12:59.160]   Yeah.
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:01.320]   So, so they need a certain amount of them.
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:04.280]   And then there's the Al Gore's of the world.
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:05.640]   Well, he's on the board.
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:08.080]   I'm sure every member of the board of directors gets to go.
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:10.840]   I don't think I've ever seen was it in Apple event.
[00:13:10.840 --> 00:13:11.840]   Have you?
[00:13:11.840 --> 00:13:14.000]   I don't think I know.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.200]   Are you going?
[00:13:16.200 --> 00:13:19.240]   That would be no, sir.
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:21.040]   I like the laugh.
[00:13:21.040 --> 00:13:22.040]   How about you, Ben?
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:24.720]   Can you get your invitation or is it stuck in the mail?
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:28.200]   I didn't try this year and it must be stuck in the mail.
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:34.560]   But I've been in years past and it's been, it's, it's just, it's a weird event.
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:38.040]   And I have to say, this might be a little controversial, but I have to say, like, even
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:42.080]   with the new theater, which I think is really exciting and this revolving door and all this
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:47.600]   stuff, I feel like 10 years on, it's like, it's getting a little tired.
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:48.600]   Maybe?
[00:13:48.600 --> 00:13:49.600]   I don't know.
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:52.000]   See, I would say that, but people would say, oh, Leo, that's right.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:53.800]   That's just sour grapes.
[00:13:53.800 --> 00:13:59.080]   You've got your nose pressed against the glass and you don't want it to be inside interesting.
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:01.760]   But I kind of agree with you when it was Steve.
[00:14:01.760 --> 00:14:06.120]   I mean, Steve was a master showman and I was always grateful for the chance just to see
[00:14:06.120 --> 00:14:10.800]   him work and to say, you know, same way I'd be grateful for a chance to see Frank Sinatra
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:11.800]   sing.
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:14.600]   It's you're watching the best at work.
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:19.880]   But Tim Cook's not exactly Mr. Inspiration, Phil Schiller, Craig Federighi, Eddie Q.
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:22.880]   These are definitely sick.
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:23.880]   I'm here.
[00:14:23.880 --> 00:14:25.240]   Jimmy Ivey, maybe.
[00:14:25.240 --> 00:14:30.400]   And also, I think like, you know, the other thing is the Steve note, right?
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:34.080]   Like, this is, it's become a trope, right?
[00:14:34.080 --> 00:14:35.080]   Right.
[00:14:35.080 --> 00:14:37.400]   And I just think that that's, I don't know.
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:44.440]   I mean, I'm looking, I'm going to watch, obviously, but, you know, I just 10 years on,
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:48.000]   I'm looking for something exciting and different.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.200]   And I, I guess probably a lot of people are.
[00:14:50.200 --> 00:14:51.200]   Yeah.
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:14:52.200]   Yeah.
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:53.200]   Yeah.
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:54.200]   We will, we will hold on a second.
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:55.200]   We will stream it.
[00:14:55.200 --> 00:14:57.720]   I just want to mention for people who do want to watch, you can watch, of course, Apple
[00:14:57.720 --> 00:15:01.280]   will stream it, but you have to have an Apple device to watch it.
[00:15:01.280 --> 00:15:06.400]   Actually, you have to watch it on Safari or an Apple device or weirdly, Microsoft Edge,
[00:15:06.400 --> 00:15:09.440]   browser will work if you have Windows 10.
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:11.520]   Who do they pay for that?
[00:15:11.520 --> 00:15:12.520]   I don't know.
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:17.800]   It's that I guess it has to do with the HLS stream, but we will also stream it.
[00:15:17.800 --> 00:15:19.640]   You can watch it on any device, our stream.
[00:15:19.640 --> 00:15:25.960]   But the only bad thing about that is I, Megan Moroney and Alex Lindsay will be, you know,
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.200]   commenting behind it.
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:31.800]   We're doing our Mystery Science Theater 3000 little silhouette commenting on that.
[00:15:31.800 --> 00:15:35.160]   That's always fun, but it's sometimes a noise people, they go, stop talking.
[00:15:35.160 --> 00:15:36.520]   I want to hear what Tim has to say.
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:38.760]   So you can watch Tim or you can watch us.
[00:15:38.760 --> 00:15:39.760]   Go ahead, Phil.
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:40.760]   Sorry.
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:45.400]   There's no question that the quality fell down when after Steve Jobs died.
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:50.520]   You know, Tim Cook has no Steve Jobs and we could talk about that for quite a while.
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:55.480]   And some of the guys feel like they're kind of phoning it in.
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.880]   Jimmy Iving was a disaster as it turns out.
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:16:02.240]   He was a very magnetic personality, but he wandered.
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.240]   You didn't know where it was going.
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.240]   He couldn't stay on the script.
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:05.240]   Yeah.
[00:16:05.240 --> 00:16:06.240]   Yeah, no.
[00:16:06.240 --> 00:16:07.720]   What a terrible introduction of Apple Music.
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:12.040]   And then I do think Federico, Federico, how do you pronounce it?
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:13.040]   I say Federico.
[00:16:13.040 --> 00:16:17.440]   He's a G-H like Spaghetti.
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:24.600]   I mean, he's nothing but dad jokes, but at least he can hold the stage.
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:26.040]   He's self mocking.
[00:16:26.040 --> 00:16:27.040]   Let's put it that way.
[00:16:27.040 --> 00:16:28.040]   Yeah.
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:29.840]   Craig at least has also the gravitas.
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.800]   He's in charge of iOS and software.
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:39.880]   Whereas you feel like a little bit Phil Schiller, the marketing guy, Eddie Q, the music guy,
[00:16:39.880 --> 00:16:43.640]   and they're really chills.
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:48.720]   And even though obviously Steve Jobs was a product chill, he just was so good at it, you
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:53.440]   forgot that he was selling, that he was marketing to you.
[00:16:53.440 --> 00:16:56.840]   And that was the famous reality distortion field, that field.
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:17:00.960]   The thing, I look forward to these events.
[00:17:00.960 --> 00:17:04.480]   And I'm not the biggest fan of the Apple devices or anything like that.
[00:17:04.480 --> 00:17:09.480]   But their presentations are probably the most polished that you'll see out there.
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:15.360]   Even though I did have an issue with Steve Jobs and the magical coin that he put on every
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:16.360]   single one.
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:17.360]   Every single one was magic.
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:20.080]   And I'm like, okay, you're pushing it a little far.
[00:17:20.080 --> 00:17:23.200]   I know you're the man, Steve Jobs, but come on now.
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:28.680]   It went over the top when he said the magic iPod socks that were introduced.
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:34.280]   I was like, okay, there's nothing magic about socks for your iPod.
[00:17:34.280 --> 00:17:37.080]   Please, Steve, please.
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:40.320]   Well, the device is supposed to be the main thing.
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:41.320]   That's the thing, right?
[00:17:41.320 --> 00:17:42.320]   That's the device.
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:43.320]   It certainly will be this time.
[00:17:43.320 --> 00:17:44.320]   Yeah.
[00:17:44.320 --> 00:17:46.720]   I mean, what's the alternative to the Samsung event?
[00:17:46.720 --> 00:17:50.960]   Well, Samsung was notoriously bad for a while.
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:55.760]   I remember the Broadway show, which was kind, was like, what am I watching?
[00:17:55.760 --> 00:17:59.760]   But the last Samsung event, the Note 8 event, actually I thought was pretty well done.
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:03.680]   But the star of that was not the presenters who were awful.
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:06.040]   But the really interesting stage.
[00:18:06.040 --> 00:18:12.880]   The stage that was a screen and then side screens and the graphics flowed to the point
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:16.360]   where it looked like it was a little tiny person in a giant field or whatever.
[00:18:16.360 --> 00:18:17.920]   I thought that was kind of neat.
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:18.920]   That was beautiful.
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:24.840]   But I feel bad in those Samsung events because it's almost like they're begging for applause
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:28.480]   and the crowd, they're just like whatever.
[00:18:28.480 --> 00:18:33.560]   That's why you have to do what Apple did, which is have 650 employees who are damn well
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:37.040]   gone applaud every applause line.
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:39.120]   The problems are out.
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:41.240]   Because it's their job on the line.
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:42.240]   All right.
[00:18:42.240 --> 00:18:47.540]   But now in all seriousness, the big event for Sunday or Tuesday will be, of course, the
[00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:49.240]   new iPhone.
[00:18:49.240 --> 00:18:56.000]   There is now another leak this coming from the iOS 11 source code, which apparently has
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:03.280]   a leaked out and Thomas Stoughton British name has analyzed it.
[00:19:03.280 --> 00:19:10.280]   And interestingly, it looks like the name of the new iPhones will be not 7S, although
[00:19:10.280 --> 00:19:17.240]   it really will be a 7S, but iPhone 8, iPhone 8 plus and iPhone 10 for the 10th anniversary
[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:20.800]   iPhone and the 10 being an X, which I think is wrong.
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:24.080]   I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that's mistake.
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:25.680]   That's not what they're going to call it.
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:29.040]   They don't even call Mac OS, Mac OS 10 anymore.
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:32.200]   It's just Mac OS.
[00:19:32.200 --> 00:19:33.920]   Philip, come on.
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:34.920]   iPhone X.
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:38.920]   A couple of things.
[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:40.200]   You've conflated two leaks.
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:43.000]   There was one leak that came out for the AirPod.
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.160]   And then there was the other leak that came out Thursday from Mac rumors and nine to five
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:50.680]   Mac, which has really pissed Apple off.
[00:19:50.680 --> 00:19:52.480]   Oh, interesting.
[00:19:52.480 --> 00:19:58.560]   To take a step back, they put a lot of effort into these releases.
[00:19:58.560 --> 00:20:03.520]   The reason they're so slick is because the jobs used to treat them like Broadway shows.
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:07.840]   He would rehearse and rehearse and rehearse and everything is scripted down to the last
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:13.400]   minute.
[00:20:13.400 --> 00:20:19.520]   What they count on, the drama of these things is the big reveal where they show something
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:21.680]   and it's a surprise.
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:30.400]   The new iPhone, whatever they're going to call it, has been so thoroughly picked over.
[00:20:30.400 --> 00:20:32.400]   It spoils it doesn't it.
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:34.160]   Yeah, leaks all around.
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:36.920]   But they had a few things that they'd held back.
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:41.560]   And then what happened was they released the gold master of iOS 11.
[00:20:41.560 --> 00:20:43.520]   And I'm on that list.
[00:20:43.520 --> 00:20:47.280]   I get the gold master, but I don't know what to do with it.
[00:20:47.280 --> 00:20:50.160]   I can't find any secrets in it.
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:57.920]   And according to John Gruber, who I assume is basically Phil Schiller speaking to us through
[00:20:57.920 --> 00:21:04.760]   the blog, said this is the most damaging rumor in the history of Apple.
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:06.440]   The most damaging leave.
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:10.400]   More than the leaving the iPhone for in a bar.
[00:21:10.400 --> 00:21:11.400]   I know.
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:12.400]   Come on.
[00:21:12.400 --> 00:21:13.880]   But this is what he's saying.
[00:21:13.880 --> 00:21:18.640]   And the reason they're upset about it is that was an accident, leaving it in the bar.
[00:21:18.640 --> 00:21:27.040]   What seems to have happened is somebody, there's all this stuff in the gold master, but you
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:30.920]   have to be a total geek and you have to know where to look to find it.
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:37.520]   And the suspicion is that some disgruntled employee sent out the the auros to tell people
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:45.320]   where do I find the new AirPod thing that has the light on the outside.
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:48.120]   And there's a little video that shows that.
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:50.640]   And the, you know, where is the name of the?
[00:21:50.640 --> 00:21:51.760]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:52.760]   These are assets.
[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:55.480]   These are digital assets within the gold master.
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:21:56.480]   Right.
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:22:03.760]   And somebody, the theory is somebody leaked it to nine to five Mac and Mac rumors.
[00:22:03.760 --> 00:22:08.800]   And the last remaining surprises leaked out.
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:10.200]   And I don't buy it.
[00:22:10.200 --> 00:22:11.200]   I don't buy it.
[00:22:11.200 --> 00:22:12.720]   It can't be the iPhone X.
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:13.720]   It makes no sense.
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:14.720]   Yeah.
[00:22:14.720 --> 00:22:18.040]   First of all, half the world will call it the X, which is a terrible name.
[00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:21.480]   For the iPhone, half the world call it 10.
[00:22:21.480 --> 00:22:23.600]   They don't have a 10 product anymore.
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:26.120]   They, they deprecated that with Mac OS.
[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:27.120]   It's clear.
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:29.640]   I'm going to go out on the limb and say it's not going to be called.
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:31.520]   That's going to be the iPhone pro.
[00:22:31.520 --> 00:22:33.320]   They have a Mac pro, iMac pro.
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:34.720]   They have a MacBook pro.
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:35.720]   They have an iPad pro.
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:38.720]   The only thing that's not in a pro line is the iPhone.
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:39.800]   It's the iPhone pro.
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:40.800]   What is this X?
[00:22:40.800 --> 00:22:43.960]   I think this is all disinformation.
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:45.640]   X is a variable.
[00:22:45.640 --> 00:22:47.040]   X is a variable.
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:48.040]   It's meaningless.
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:49.040]   Right.
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:53.600]   Do you think it could be the iPhone edition, you know, with some $17,000 price tag like
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:54.600]   that one tag?
[00:22:54.600 --> 00:22:56.800]   Well, that's one thing we also think.
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:01.760]   I don't think it'll be 17 grand, but we do expect it to be the most expensive mainstream
[00:23:01.760 --> 00:23:03.480]   smartphone ever sold, right?
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:04.480]   1200 bucks.
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:08.160]   My theory, my theory is that, and it's not unique to me, is that they drop the numbers
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:10.400]   all together and it's the iPhone.
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:16.040]   It's just the iPhone, the iPhone plus and the iPhone pro is as good as that.
[00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:17.040]   That would make sense.
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:18.040]   Wouldn't it?
[00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:19.040]   Yeah.
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:20.040]   Yeah.
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:21.840]   So is this disinformation though?
[00:23:21.840 --> 00:23:26.720]   Well, I'll let that be too confusing for the next release.
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:28.120]   That's what we said about the iPad.
[00:23:28.120 --> 00:23:29.920]   They call it the iPad.
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:30.920]   How confusing is that?
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:31.920]   I have to.
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:32.920]   But it's not selling.
[00:23:32.920 --> 00:23:33.920]   Right?
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:34.920]   Nobody's buying that one.
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:35.920]   Comparatively.
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:36.920]   Right.
[00:23:36.920 --> 00:23:37.920]   I don't know.
[00:23:37.920 --> 00:23:41.160]   And we'll find out on Tuesday and it's kind of a tempest in a teapot.
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:42.520]   It is who cares.
[00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:46.560]   The other thing, there are even more important things leaked in that than the name.
[00:23:46.560 --> 00:23:52.840]   And I guess the main thing is that there's a, you can see within it a watch face for the
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:58.560]   Apple Watch that has a little LTE symbol on it.
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:00.720]   We knew that anyway.
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:01.720]   We knew that was coming.
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:03.560]   Well, you don't know.
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:06.720]   You've heard rumors that it's going to happen.
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:09.920]   And this would be support for that rumor.
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:12.480]   We don't know anything until Tuesday.
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:13.480]   Apple has said nothing.
[00:24:13.480 --> 00:24:16.960]   In fact, it's a global said anything else about it.
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:22.320]   By the way, just, am I going to, oh, I, we, you know this, obviously, and I, Robert was
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:25.360]   on the show six months ago and said, there's going to be a clear iPhone.
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:26.360]   It's amazing.
[00:24:26.360 --> 00:24:27.920]   It's going to be augmented reality.
[00:24:27.920 --> 00:24:28.920]   It's going to be clear.
[00:24:28.920 --> 00:24:32.360]   And I said, Robert, it's not there's what?
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:36.200]   And I said, if they make a clear iPhone, I'm buying you a dinner in any restaurant in
[00:24:36.200 --> 00:24:37.200]   the world.
[00:24:37.200 --> 00:24:38.200]   He said, we're going to Paris.
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:39.200]   I said, what?
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:40.200]   I'm going to get your plane ticket.
[00:24:40.200 --> 00:24:41.200]   Really?
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.200]   You think clear iPhone?
[00:24:42.200 --> 00:24:44.560]   No, no, I think I'm safe on this bet, but we'll find it.
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:50.680]   Here's what I think he was saying, Leon is that Leo is that with the virtual reality,
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:51.680]   you'll look through it.
[00:24:51.680 --> 00:24:52.680]   Yeah.
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:54.680]   You'll look through it and it'll be like you're looking.
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:57.320]   Well, I asked him that I think I'm going to have to go back and check the tape.
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:59.880]   Fortunately, we record these things.
[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:04.000]   But I think I said, you don't mean like, like Pokemon go where I could see the grass
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   through the phone.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:06.760]   He said, no, no, clear.
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:07.760]   Yeah.
[00:25:07.760 --> 00:25:11.120]   This is my problem with the event in general, though.
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:15.520]   Like I think the event in general were at this point where we're never actually surprised
[00:25:15.520 --> 00:25:17.800]   by what comes out.
[00:25:17.800 --> 00:25:20.560]   There's no big reveal these days, at least for me.
[00:25:20.560 --> 00:25:25.320]   Like I can't remember the last time I was like, oh yeah, I didn't even hear about this.
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:27.080]   And my mind is blown right now.
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:28.560]   That's the issue that I have.
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:34.040]   I think generally with these events is they, all this stuff gets leaked over and over.
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:39.200]   And I mean, I do think that the augmented reality, look, there's an area that I think
[00:25:39.200 --> 00:25:44.640]   Apple isn't necessarily last on or doesn't have to be last on because this is something
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:47.600]   that nobody has built the killer app for this, right?
[00:25:47.600 --> 00:25:53.320]   Unless we're talking about Pokemon go, which in many ways is the most mainstream version
[00:25:53.320 --> 00:25:56.920]   of augmented reality that anyone has experienced.
[00:25:56.920 --> 00:25:59.880]   But I don't really care about food networks.
[00:25:59.880 --> 00:26:01.640]   AR app, no offense to them.
[00:26:01.640 --> 00:26:03.280]   It just doesn't strike me as amazing.
[00:26:03.280 --> 00:26:09.040]   But like the Walking Dead AR app could be smart because it combines this entertainment
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:11.880]   brand with a new kind of app that could be really cool.
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:18.400]   If Apple does something really smart and inventive with augmented reality, I think that that
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:22.160]   could could actually be a big deal.
[00:26:22.160 --> 00:26:26.920]   That would at least make me sort of like stop whatever I'm doing and pay a lot of attention
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:29.960]   to what they are doing with AR kit, for sure.
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:32.000]   We've seen a lot of interesting AR kit demos.
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.200]   It is easier to develop for AR kit than something like say Google's Tango.
[00:26:36.200 --> 00:26:41.240]   In fact, Google was forced to respond with AR core, which is their version of AR kit,
[00:26:41.240 --> 00:26:43.920]   a dumbed down version of Tango.
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:46.200]   I think that is possible though.
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:51.640]   What do you think, Ed, that AR is the VR for 2017?
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:59.960]   It is another or 3D TV for 2017, another kind of gimmicky idea that just isn't going
[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:01.480]   to get that much traction.
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:06.960]   Well, no, because if it's Apple doing it, it's going to catch on for whatever strange
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:07.960]   reason.
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:08.960]   I don't know why.
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:14.120]   I personally don't see AR as something that's going to be huge.
[00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:19.280]   But whenever Apple says something, swipe to lock, man, it's that's the most magical
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:21.480]   thing in the world.
[00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:23.480]   You know what it reminds me of?
[00:27:23.480 --> 00:27:24.480]   There it is.
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:31.440]   It reminds me of when the first iPhone came out that you could read your phone.
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:33.320]   I can't remember what it did.
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:34.880]   It unlocked the screen.
[00:27:34.880 --> 00:27:40.280]   It sort of seemed like, eh, so what?
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:43.600]   It took two years before it worked for Apple Pay.
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:45.320]   Suddenly, it was a whole different thing.
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:49.400]   Yeah, we had fingerprint readers before, but Apple invented it, of course.
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:51.120]   But it did change it.
[00:27:51.120 --> 00:27:53.120]   They put it on the map.
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:54.120]   Yeah.
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:28:01.800]   So I don't actually, I think there's an AR on an iPhone, feels like a minor thing.
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:07.400]   I've seen virtual measuring tapes that are kind of cool, and there'll be things like
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:08.840]   that.
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:12.240]   But I think this is walking up to the glasses.
[00:28:12.240 --> 00:28:19.680]   I think Apple is working its way into having AR inside your glasses.
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:25.840]   Because you're not going to walk around with your phone all day looking to see what information
[00:28:25.840 --> 00:28:29.520]   is out there, but you might actually just look around with your glasses.
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:33.520]   Do you ever fly your drone with virtual reality glasses?
[00:28:33.520 --> 00:28:38.200]   The FPV, I've done that a time or two, not with my particular drone.
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:40.280]   But unfortunately, I struggle with Vertigo.
[00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:43.600]   I mean, I could just get dizzy staring at the camera right now.
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:50.560]   But it's a really, really nice experience to fly, but I don't think anyone should just
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:53.520]   go out and drop top dollar because it's FPV.
[00:28:53.520 --> 00:28:54.520]   Right.
[00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:56.360]   You know, it's a simple thing.
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:28:59.600]   People do a hollow lens is the most amazing thing that I've seen.
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:01.000]   You've used the hollow lens, man.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   Have you used it?
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.080]   I've used the hollow lens twice.
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:10.640]   And it is like, to me, that was the thing that I, that really stopped me in my tracks
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:12.640]   and made me go, "Holy crap.
[00:29:12.640 --> 00:29:14.440]   This could be huge.
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:15.440]   I've done two demos of it."
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:16.440]   It's TCV.
[00:29:16.440 --> 00:29:17.440]   I did that for me.
[00:29:17.440 --> 00:29:18.440]   Yeah.
[00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:19.440]   Really?
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:20.440]   Yeah.
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:23.360]   I mean, the hollow lens, it's been two years and I haven't seen any improvement.
[00:29:23.360 --> 00:29:24.360]   No.
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:26.720]   So, Microsoft put a lot behind this.
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:28.760]   They said it's not coming out to 2019.
[00:29:28.760 --> 00:29:30.400]   And this is the problem Apple's going to have too.
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:31.400]   Yeah, sure.
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:35.480]   If we could get spectacles that looked like normal glasses, not like some sort of weird
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:42.600]   Sergey Brin Borg geek thing, like a Google glass, then maybe there'd be a market price.
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:49.360]   But that technology, it has to have a standalone powerful computer in a pair of spectacles.
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:52.120]   You can walk around with enough battery life.
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:55.640]   It's going to have more than a few hours battery life.
[00:29:55.640 --> 00:29:58.480]   It has to have some sort of heads up display in the glass.
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:00.480]   All of this, I don't think we're that close.
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:01.480]   Yeah.
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:02.480]   I don't think so either.
[00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:04.480]   It's going to be terribly expensive.
[00:30:04.480 --> 00:30:05.480]   And price, right.
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:07.480]   It's got to cost something you could afford.
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:08.480]   Right.
[00:30:08.480 --> 00:30:13.440]   But you say that about every technology coming down the pike.
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:19.720]   What Apple brings to it is they've got a huge crowd of developers who are eager to be
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:26.040]   early on whatever the next thing is going to be because the first to arrive make all
[00:30:26.040 --> 00:30:27.040]   the money.
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:30.120]   So they're working on AR kit stuff.
[00:30:30.120 --> 00:30:34.880]   And the other thing Apple brings to the party is they've got whatever, five or six or seven
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:39.240]   or 800 million devices that can run this stuff or they will by the time.
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:40.880]   That's the biggest leap, isn't it?
[00:30:40.880 --> 00:30:46.800]   All of a sudden, every iPhone, I think it was from the 6S on can do this.
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:48.240]   That's a giant market.
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:49.680]   All of a sudden that in nowhere.
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:57.120]   So it doesn't take too many interesting apps for people to try it out.
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:03.880]   And it could be something that people make money on the iPhone for a while.
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:11.360]   It does feel like until there's a new, it's on the inside of a car windshield or it's
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:13.440]   on inside the glasses.
[00:31:13.440 --> 00:31:17.800]   It doesn't feel like a hugely significant technology to me.
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:18.800]   I want to take a little break.
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:24.640]   When we come back, I want to talk about the other major technology that will apparently
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:29.880]   be revealed in the new iPhone that Apple was forced to include because they couldn't figure
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:36.400]   out how to make touch ID work through the screen and that's face ID or face recognition.
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:40.680]   Our guest, Dan Pruitt, who's joining us from Tech Republic, contributing right of their
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:46.160]   photographer, droner, podcaster and a Clemson fan.
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:48.360]   You know it.
[00:31:48.360 --> 00:31:53.920]   Most importantly, also with us Ben Johnson, you hear him on the codebreaker podcast.
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:55.320]   He's the creator there.
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:57.120]   Heard him for a long time at marketplace.
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:58.840]   There are tech columnists there.
[00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:01.360]   Molly Wood's taking his place and he's got something new in the works.
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:04.640]   We'll find out about that someday, not today.
[00:32:04.640 --> 00:32:05.640]   Someday.
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:06.640]   Someday.
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:07.640]   Like Monday.
[00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:10.320]   That's a bigger announcement than the Apple announcement.
[00:32:10.320 --> 00:32:11.320]   Forget the Apple announcement.
[00:32:11.320 --> 00:32:13.120]   What's happening Monday?
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:14.640]   And it's good to have you been.
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:16.960]   And also with us, of course, the great filler.
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:20.040]   Elmer DeWitt from ped30.com.
[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:22.600]   Apple watcher.
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:26.160]   And somebody who will actually be at the Apple event on Tuesday.
[00:32:26.160 --> 00:32:31.880]   I think I want you to explore the new Steve Jobs Theater and look for secret places.
[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:37.400]   Well, you know, the new Facebook rules say that if you have at least 100 followers, and
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:42.960]   I think I have 112 on Facebook, you can shoot live and it goes straight up.
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:49.120]   A little point I'd like to just mention, the last time I was at an Apple event in 2010,
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:50.880]   the iPod, I'm sorry.
[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:53.080]   Yeah, the iPad announced.
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:58.320]   I live streamed, I turned my computer around live stream Steve Jobs and I've never been
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:32:59.320]   invited back, Philip.
[00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:00.320]   Just want to mention.
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:01.320]   Oh, well, I wasn't.
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:08.120]   I wasn't live live because I'd be competing with apples much higher risk.
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:09.680]   They didn't have a stream then.
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:10.680]   That's what I thought.
[00:33:10.680 --> 00:33:11.680]   Well, somebody ought to do this.
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:14.480]   I've got all these cameras behind me.
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:15.480]   Did they complain to you?
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:16.480]   No, they said not a word.
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:18.080]   I just never got invited back.
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:19.080]   Yeah.
[00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:20.800]   I don't even, it may not be really that at all.
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:21.800]   I have no idea.
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:22.800]   I don't know.
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:25.960]   Yeah, maybe because you bad enough apples.
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:30.280]   I don't think unfairly do I am fair Apple.
[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:31.280]   Yeah.
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:33.520]   No, you think I'm unfair to Apple?
[00:33:33.520 --> 00:33:36.440]   No, no, I don't think you're unfair.
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:40.480]   You come with a Windows friend.
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:41.560]   That's so untrue.
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:42.840]   I am not Windows friendly.
[00:33:42.840 --> 00:33:47.800]   I owned every Mac I bought a Mac in 1984 in the first hundred days.
[00:33:47.800 --> 00:33:49.800]   I've owned every iPhone.
[00:33:49.800 --> 00:33:52.600]   You own every piece of technology that comes down the trica.
[00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:55.280]   But I hated Windows for a long time.
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:34:00.760]   It's only recently when I think Windows has become a fair rival to a Macintosh.
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:06.560]   And mostly because Apple has neglected its strengths and produced crappy hardware in
[00:34:06.560 --> 00:34:08.160]   the last couple of years.
[00:34:08.160 --> 00:34:10.760]   And its operating system started getting superannuated.
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:14.920]   Thank goodness for APFS, the new file system.
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:16.920]   That's what I'm honest.
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:17.920]   That's called honest.
[00:34:17.920 --> 00:34:19.760]   I was a good skepticism.
[00:34:19.760 --> 00:34:20.760]   I like a skepticism.
[00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:21.760]   I'm honest.
[00:34:21.760 --> 00:34:22.760]   Apple fanboy.
[00:34:22.760 --> 00:34:23.760]   Well, you know what?
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:24.760]   I am.
[00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:28.000]   This is why it hurts me a little bit that you said that Phil because I am an Apple fanboy.
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:29.320]   I want them to do better.
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:31.960]   I'm disappointed that they haven't lately.
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:32.960]   Yeah.
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:33.960]   Yeah.
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:34.960]   I'm with you.
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:35.960]   I'm with you.
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:38.200]   Anyways, all I was going to say is I'm just going to shoot the, I think what people want
[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:41.200]   to see is the inside of the Steve Jobs Theater and whatever else.
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:42.200]   I'll stream that.
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:43.200]   I'll show us.
[00:34:43.200 --> 00:34:44.200]   Yeah.
[00:34:44.200 --> 00:34:45.200]   Yeah.
[00:34:45.200 --> 00:34:46.200]   That's what I'll do.
[00:34:46.200 --> 00:34:47.880]   It's the most doctor evil looking thing I've ever seen.
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:50.000]   Well, there's also, I mean, I haven't seen it.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   But it's, yeah.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   It's a glass.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:59.400]   So there's the glass, the entry way is this big glass wide open thing, which it's not
[00:34:59.400 --> 00:35:00.400]   clear.
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:01.400]   Is that going to be the demo area?
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:02.400]   There will be a demo area.
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.160]   There's some, if you look at the plans, there's something underneath.
[00:35:04.160 --> 00:35:05.760]   There's escalators down.
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:09.120]   It's the world's largest carbon fiber roof on top of it.
[00:35:09.120 --> 00:35:11.160]   But you, you, the theater is underground.
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:12.160]   Right.
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:13.160]   Dr. Evil.
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:14.160]   Yeah.
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:16.200]   And so you take the escalators to the underground theater.
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:20.960]   If that's the demo area, somebody said that there are walls, automated walls that can
[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:23.660]   come up and hide the demo area.
[00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:27.240]   So when you enter, it'll be blacked out and then you'll go in and go down.
[00:35:27.240 --> 00:35:31.120]   And then after the event, the walls will come down and then the whole world will be
[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:32.280]   able to see through the glat.
[00:35:32.280 --> 00:35:33.280]   I don't know.
[00:35:33.280 --> 00:35:36.840]   These are, and then the floor opens up and there's a pool with sharks with pricking laser
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:37.840]   beams on their heads.
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:38.840]   I think that's, yeah.
[00:35:38.840 --> 00:35:42.040]   It is so Dr. Evil.
[00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:43.920]   What's this rotating elevator you were saying?
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:44.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:49.240]   There's like a loading elevator that.
[00:35:49.240 --> 00:35:52.480]   I love the fact that you're trolling them about Dr. Evil.
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:54.920]   Considering that cheer that you're sitting in right now.
[00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:55.920]   Wait a minute.
[00:35:55.920 --> 00:35:57.360]   That's, well, you're right.
[00:35:57.360 --> 00:35:58.360]   That's good.
[00:35:58.360 --> 00:35:59.880]   Look at your chair, man.
[00:35:59.880 --> 00:36:01.720]   All I need is a naked cat.
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:05.160]   This is definitely watch this.
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:15.000]   That was a, did I kill my life?
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   Beautiful.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   All right.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   You can hear me still.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   Okay.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:21.680]   Little tip for Dr. Evils.
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:24.920]   If you're going to be an evil genius, make sure your mic is clear.
[00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:27.280]   Our show today brought to you by Qualcomm.
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:31.920]   It'll be interesting to see one of the things we interest to see if Apple continues to use
[00:36:31.920 --> 00:36:36.160]   the best LTE radios out there, the Qualcomm LTE radios.
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:42.080]   Remember in the last iPhone, they did 50/50 and the Intel radios they put in were not
[00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:43.160]   so fast.
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:46.960]   So they slowed down the Qualcomm radios so that nobody feel bad.
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:47.960]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:48.960]   Don't want you to feel bad.
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:53.400]   Look, if you're going to get a new phone, get an Android phone with a Qualcomm snack,
[00:36:53.400 --> 00:37:01.080]   Dragon Gigabit LTE radio in it with additional lanes for data to flow on four by four MIMO,
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:02.920]   256 quam.
[00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:05.920]   These are, it's got carrier bonding.
[00:37:05.920 --> 00:37:09.560]   These are the fastest LTE phones ever made.
[00:37:09.560 --> 00:37:16.520]   The Note 8, the S8, the S8 active, the Z Force, the HTC U11 because they've got this amazing
[00:37:16.520 --> 00:37:21.720]   LTE radio designed to deliver the fastest mobile connectivity and help speed things up
[00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:23.840]   even in crowded places.
[00:37:23.840 --> 00:37:27.800]   You could turbo charge all your connected apps stream 360 degree videos and YouTube
[00:37:27.800 --> 00:37:35.320]   VR and 4K resolution with minimal buffering, minimal stuttering and lest you feel guilty,
[00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:42.040]   it's better for everybody because it makes everybody's connection faster even in congested
[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:43.600]   networks.
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:48.920]   If you don't have to feel bad because everybody's getting better performance, Gigabit LTE
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:54.320]   as much as seven times faster than your home Wi-Fi carrier aggregation four by four MIMO,
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:57.120]   you can read all about this 256 quam.
[00:37:57.120 --> 00:38:03.240]   If you go to the website, snapdragon.com/gigabit, make the most of your unlimited data plan to
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:09.480]   learn more about faster network connections in crowded places, snapdragon.com/gigabit.
[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:16.480]   Thank you, thank you, so much.
[00:38:16.480 --> 00:38:23.480]   I'm really happy to have you as an advertiser before their support of this week in tech.
[00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:30.480]   I was just reading John Gruber's, wow, you're right, he was scathing.
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:34.480]   John Gruber's a daring fireball article about this Apple leak.
[00:38:34.480 --> 00:38:39.200]   If the leak was sent by an Apple employee, Gruber says I could state with nearly 100%
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:45.600]   certainty that it was, I think there's a good chance Apple's going to find out who it was.
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:50.800]   He says these URLs, these URLs that were hidden in the gold master were not discovered
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:57.280]   by guessing, but because they were published at obvious URLs prematurely, somebody who
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:02.400]   works at Apple emailed these URLs to nine to five Mac and Mac rumors, possibly without
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:06.760]   even knowing just how much information could be gleaned from them.
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:10.760]   He says let me clarify that sentence, whoever leaked these URLs knew it would be an incredibly
[00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:15.080]   damaged, damaging leak.
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:19.840]   He says this person should be ashamed of themselves and should be very worried when
[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:21.840]   their phone next rings.
[00:39:21.840 --> 00:39:32.160]   They should be worried because Apple famously hired former CIA and NSA leak busters to chase
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:38.560]   these guys down.
[00:39:38.560 --> 00:39:42.560]   Mark Gurman was the guy who was doing most of the leaking when he was still at nine to
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:45.640]   five Mac before he went to Bloomberg.
[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:49.160]   It was clearly coming from the inside.
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:52.240]   It wasn't stuff coming from Taiwan.
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:58.000]   It was inside the software leaks.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.440]   A couple guys got fired shortly after Apple.
[00:40:01.440 --> 00:40:02.440]   They'll get fired.
[00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:09.320]   Steve Jobs was famous for, he would hire new people and put them on bogus projects for
[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:14.520]   a 100 day trial period to see if they leaked anything about the bogus project.
[00:40:14.520 --> 00:40:18.280]   He would know it was them because no one else was working on it or he would give people
[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:21.720]   selective information and wait to see what leaked.
[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:25.440]   Jobs was notoriously paranoid.
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:30.320]   It was funny because the anti-leak training that Apple gives to its new employees was
[00:40:30.320 --> 00:40:32.720]   leaked.
[00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:38.280]   And Apple quite rightly said in this anti-leak training, it spoils it.
[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:39.400]   It spoils it for us.
[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:40.560]   It spoils it for everybody.
[00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:46.880]   Your colleagues are working hard on new products and a big part of the new product is the launch,
[00:40:46.880 --> 00:40:48.280]   the release, the unveiling.
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:51.080]   Our fans, our customers love it.
[00:40:51.080 --> 00:40:54.960]   It's important for us in marketing terms and you can really spoil it.
[00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:55.960]   I agree with you.
[00:40:55.960 --> 00:41:05.280]   Gruber obviously got a call from his buddy Phil who said, "We're going to get this guy."
[00:41:05.280 --> 00:41:09.800]   What's left out of that though is, "Okay, I feel bad for the guys at Apple who work
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:12.200]   so hard and we're hoping that they could keep it as surprise."
[00:41:12.200 --> 00:41:15.800]   But look at it from the journalist's point of view.
[00:41:15.800 --> 00:41:21.560]   There's a lot of people who are trying to make a living, retailing, whatever information
[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:27.440]   they can get about Apple, there's thousands of investors who love this stuff.
[00:41:27.440 --> 00:41:29.680]   And the journalists are working hard.
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:30.680]   Sorry, job.
[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:31.680]   Yeah.
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:36.080]   For instance, I think partly we do it because we know you're interested.
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:40.480]   Look, you want to get your articles, your blog posts read, you want to get your podcasts,
[00:41:40.480 --> 00:41:42.440]   listen to you, talk about Apple rumors.
[00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:47.080]   But also, I think there's a very legitimate need to know on the part of consumers because
[00:41:47.080 --> 00:41:52.280]   right now you can buy an essential phone, a note 8, you can maybe hold off for the pixel.
[00:41:52.280 --> 00:41:54.560]   You're wondering what Apple's going to do.
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:41:55.560]   Should I wait or not?
[00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:57.160]   And this is consumer information.
[00:41:57.160 --> 00:42:00.960]   I think it's absolutely appropriate to tell us, tell everything we know.
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:05.320]   And it's totally not our job to protect Apple's secrets.
[00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:06.320]   No, right?
[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:09.080]   No, that's their job, apparently a job they'd be quite aware of.
[00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:10.080]   Right, that's their job.
[00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:16.200]   I always wonder what leaks like that, especially coming from an internal employee.
[00:42:16.200 --> 00:42:17.200]   What is their motivation?
[00:42:17.200 --> 00:42:18.680]   You know, is it money?
[00:42:18.680 --> 00:42:21.240]   Is it an accident or what?
[00:42:21.240 --> 00:42:25.280]   Because you're working at Apple, I would presume you have it pretty good as a staff
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:28.120]   and they're not someone that's in one of the factories.
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:33.520]   But yet you still want to potentially leak out some information to the press and I apologize
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:37.320]   for Kylo Finn back here barking at the rabbits in the window.
[00:42:37.320 --> 00:42:41.200]   Your dog is named Kylo Finn.
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:44.880]   Is that some sort of Star Wars reference?
[00:42:44.880 --> 00:42:46.320]   That would be correct, sir.
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:50.680]   But kind of like a messed up Star Wars reference.
[00:42:50.680 --> 00:42:52.680]   Pretty much.
[00:42:52.680 --> 00:42:53.680]   Okay.
[00:42:53.680 --> 00:42:57.800]   No, but we got this conversation actually.
[00:42:57.800 --> 00:43:01.240]   It's funny you should mention this, because on Windows Weekly this week, I asked Mary
[00:43:01.240 --> 00:43:04.720]   Joe Foley, who is kind of like Mark Gurman for Microsoft.
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:06.840]   She gets a lot of information.
[00:43:06.840 --> 00:43:08.000]   Why do people talk to you?
[00:43:08.000 --> 00:43:09.440]   And there are a lot of reasons.
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:12.400]   Some of it is disaffected employees.
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:16.760]   And as good as it is working at Apple, there's got to be some people who are unhappy, working
[00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:18.440]   at the fruit factory.
[00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:21.120]   And then some of it is the glory.
[00:43:21.120 --> 00:43:23.320]   I know something no one knows.
[00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:28.840]   I like being able to be the first person to tell you, Mary Joe, about this thing.
[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:30.360]   There's lots of reasons people leak.
[00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:34.400]   And of course, people like Mark Gurman and Mary Joe Foley spend a lot of energy cultivating
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:36.360]   sources for that reason exactly.
[00:43:36.360 --> 00:43:40.200]   Then you get into the whole code of ethics for your employer.
[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:43.960]   I don't get it myself personally.
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:50.680]   Someone was asking within the White House, which is leaks like a sieve, why they were
[00:43:50.680 --> 00:43:51.680]   doing it.
[00:43:51.680 --> 00:43:53.680]   And they said, "Oh, it's therapy.
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:56.240]   I need to get it off my chest.
[00:43:56.240 --> 00:43:57.640]   I got to tell somebody.
[00:43:57.640 --> 00:43:59.440]   You won't believe what happened today."
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:00.440]   This is kind of cute.
[00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:02.040]   Get it off my chest, please.
[00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:03.040]   It might be.
[00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:04.960]   It makes you feel important.
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:06.480]   There's a lot of reasons.
[00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:07.480]   You're right, though.
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:10.440]   Obviously, it's not good for the company.
[00:44:10.440 --> 00:44:11.920]   It's unethical.
[00:44:11.920 --> 00:44:15.480]   You're violating your commitment to the company that you work at it.
[00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:17.200]   You shouldn't do it.
[00:44:17.200 --> 00:44:18.760]   But as a journalist, I'm glad we get leaks.
[00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:20.920]   I don't actually deal in leaks.
[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:23.880]   I deal in other people's leaks.
[00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:27.080]   We talk about people who have got leaks.
[00:44:27.080 --> 00:44:32.560]   So I'm glad there's people like Mary Joe and Mark Gurman who do this.
[00:44:32.560 --> 00:44:36.760]   I try to avoid rumors because it's not useful.
[00:44:36.760 --> 00:44:39.760]   Unless you can confirm it, it doesn't help.
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:44.280]   But at this point, I feel like a lot of these rumors are--
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:46.920]   there's a convergence as you get closer and closer to these events.
[00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:50.400]   A lot of them at this point have to be true, right?
[00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:51.400]   Yes.
[00:44:51.400 --> 00:44:54.400]   And we've been to enough-- we've been to enough keynotes where it turned out.
[00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:55.400]   Yeah, they were true.
[00:44:55.400 --> 00:44:56.680]   It is kind of disappointing.
[00:44:56.680 --> 00:44:59.400]   When you get a keynote and you go, "Oh, we knew all that."
[00:44:59.400 --> 00:45:00.400]   Yeah.
[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:02.280]   That's why I'm here.
[00:45:02.280 --> 00:45:09.640]   Yeah, that's why I am of the very probably wrong opinion that this most recent leak is
[00:45:09.640 --> 00:45:11.240]   disinformation.
[00:45:11.240 --> 00:45:17.560]   That Apple knew that they prepared this information and it will not be the iPhone 8 and 8 Plus
[00:45:17.560 --> 00:45:18.560]   or iPhone X.
[00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:22.960]   It is going to be something else and it's disinformation.
[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:27.320]   And then there'll be-- doesn't it-- is it not unreasonable to think that Apple might do
[00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:28.320]   that?
[00:45:28.320 --> 00:45:29.320]   Be that sophisticated?
[00:45:29.320 --> 00:45:32.120]   Well, at a certain point, they have to, right?
[00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:36.560]   At a certain point, this has happened enough times now and it's a regular enough thing that
[00:45:36.560 --> 00:45:41.720]   we basically know what's going to be happening with the new device before we actually see
[00:45:41.720 --> 00:45:42.720]   the new device.
[00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:43.720]   Right.
[00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:47.640]   At a certain point, you have to imagine that a company like Apple has to say, "Well, we
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:50.360]   need to figure out a way to fight back against this."
[00:45:50.360 --> 00:45:54.080]   So I don't think that's an unreasonable conspiracy theory at all.
[00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:56.240]   One of the stories came out of the Wall Street Journal.
[00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:57.760]   Actually, a story we've been hearing for months.
[00:45:57.760 --> 00:46:05.000]   They repeated it this week that Apple had-- in order to increase the bezel on the new iPhone
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:06.240]   and everybody's doing that.
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:10.600]   If you're going to get a flagship phone this year, you're going to get a flagship phone
[00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:13.360]   that has a bigger screen without a bigger phone.
[00:46:13.360 --> 00:46:15.040]   That's the holy grail.
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:16.880]   And does it-- No chin, no forehead.
[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:22.160]   --does it by eliminating both the side frames, the bezels, but also the forehead at the top
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:23.160]   of the chin at the bottom.
[00:46:23.160 --> 00:46:28.040]   But of course, you do that on an iPhone, you eliminate the home button, which does two
[00:46:28.040 --> 00:46:29.040]   things.
[00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:34.160]   It's a very important navigation button on the iPhone because a lot of apps-- it's the
[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:36.360]   only way to get out of the app.
[00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:39.160]   I haven't seen a quit in any app in years on the iPhone.
[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:40.880]   You're supposed to press the home button.
[00:46:40.880 --> 00:46:44.520]   So that's the quit button as much as anything else, the back button.
[00:46:44.520 --> 00:46:46.640]   But also, it's touch ID.
[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:47.640]   Apple didn't do it.
[00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:49.960]   Others have done put the touch ID on the back.
[00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:54.200]   But according to the journal, try to make the touch ID work through the screen.
[00:46:54.200 --> 00:46:58.600]   If the screen's the whole front of the phone, you put your finger somewhere on that front
[00:46:58.600 --> 00:46:59.880]   and it would read your finger.
[00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:01.200]   They couldn't get it working.
[00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:03.000]   They thought they would.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   And they went to Plan B late in the production cycle.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   So the journal says that means these phones will be in very short supply until next year.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   There's new phones.
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:14.000]   Holly.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:15.560]   I really love the edge to edge.
[00:47:15.560 --> 00:47:17.360]   I mean, the edge to edge.
[00:47:17.360 --> 00:47:24.280]   It's just like as an Android user, I think it's the only way that I want to look at my
[00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:25.280]   phone.
[00:47:25.280 --> 00:47:27.280]   I want that screen space.
[00:47:27.280 --> 00:47:33.080]   I have to say I'm a little bit on the fence about the home button.
[00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:34.480]   It's been a while since I used an iPhone.
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:38.840]   But like, I mean, on the one hand, the physical button seems pointless these days, right?
[00:47:38.840 --> 00:47:42.440]   I mean, set the biometrics aside for a second.
[00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:46.080]   The physical button seems pointless in some ways because everything else you do is on
[00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:47.960]   the screen itself.
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:53.480]   But on the other hand, when my Android phone geeks out and I hit the home button and it
[00:47:53.480 --> 00:47:57.640]   doesn't work, I want to throw my phone out the window.
[00:47:57.640 --> 00:48:03.440]   And I feel like the physical button somehow helps mitigate the helplessness that you feel.
[00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:04.440]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:12.920]   So I have to consider what type of person is asking me this.
[00:48:12.920 --> 00:48:17.680]   And if it's someone that's not going to understand rooting and rhyming and things like that,
[00:48:17.680 --> 00:48:22.240]   I would always tell them, we get the iPhone because the second you screw something up,
[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:23.240]   just hit that home button.
[00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:24.240]   You're good.
[00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:25.960]   That's a really good point.
[00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:28.600]   It's the panic button.
[00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:29.600]   Pretty much.
[00:48:29.600 --> 00:48:30.600]   Yeah.
[00:48:30.600 --> 00:48:34.840]   Some of the rumors are that the on/off switch or what the screen on off switch will now
[00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:38.920]   become the new home button or at least assume some of that functionality.
[00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:39.920]   It'll be overloaded.
[00:48:39.920 --> 00:48:42.560]   There'll be multiple things that that button can do.
[00:48:42.560 --> 00:48:45.640]   It's going to be difficult to discover, difficult to use.
[00:48:45.640 --> 00:48:48.920]   And then because they lost the fingerprint reader, they're going to do face recognition.
[00:48:48.920 --> 00:48:55.480]   They're going to apparently, according to rumor call it face ID, raises a lot of questions.
[00:48:55.480 --> 00:48:56.480]   Yeah.
[00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:58.840]   I'm not sure I buy that journal story.
[00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:04.600]   I tried to trace, I tried to address the question, are they really going to kill the
[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:05.600]   touch ID?
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:08.440]   Is the fingerprint recognition really going away?
[00:49:08.440 --> 00:49:13.680]   And there's only a handful of original sources on that story.
[00:49:13.680 --> 00:49:18.360]   It goes back to the Taiwanese guy whose name I always forget.
[00:49:18.360 --> 00:49:19.360]   Ming Chi Guo.
[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:20.360]   Ming Chi Guo.
[00:49:20.360 --> 00:49:21.360]   That digit times.
[00:49:21.360 --> 00:49:22.360]   Yeah.
[00:49:22.360 --> 00:49:23.360]   Yeah.
[00:49:23.360 --> 00:49:28.040]   He said definitively in February, I think it was, that it was that they definitely were
[00:49:28.040 --> 00:49:31.440]   going to kill it for the reason that the Wall Street Journal gave is that they couldn't
[00:49:31.440 --> 00:49:32.720]   get it to work.
[00:49:32.720 --> 00:49:36.920]   Samsung couldn't get it to work under the glass screen and neither could Apple.
[00:49:36.920 --> 00:49:42.720]   After that, people, I've read Mark Gurman very carefully.
[00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:51.400]   It was sort of maybe, he didn't know for sure and neither did the guys that I'm more.
[00:49:51.400 --> 00:49:56.120]   I think it would be crazy to get rid of the fingerprint recognition system that millions
[00:49:56.120 --> 00:50:02.560]   of people have learned how to use to pay, use Apple pay and to unlock their phone, even
[00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:08.640]   if the face ID thing is better and works perfectly, you don't want to take stuff away.
[00:50:08.640 --> 00:50:12.520]   It's like you don't want to take away social security when they've got it.
[00:50:12.520 --> 00:50:14.280]   So I'm skeptical.
[00:50:14.280 --> 00:50:15.280]   I'm waiting to see.
[00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:17.360]   This is one of the surprises.
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:18.680]   What is the name?
[00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:19.680]   What is the price?
[00:50:19.680 --> 00:50:22.000]   And did they really kill Facebook recognition?
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   I'm waiting to see.
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   Touch ID.
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   Touch ID.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   Touch ID.
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:27.320]   You know, there's a lot of questions.
[00:50:27.320 --> 00:50:32.080]   Face recognition raises, of course, it can't be always looking for your face.
[00:50:32.080 --> 00:50:40.640]   So you've got to trigger it somehow with a gesture of a button press or a noise or something.
[00:50:40.640 --> 00:50:43.120]   You pick up the phone, I think, in the movement.
[00:50:43.120 --> 00:50:44.120]   We don't know.
[00:50:44.120 --> 00:50:45.120]   We will see.
[00:50:45.120 --> 00:50:48.360]   And, of course, it's from a security point of view.
[00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:49.840]   It's a disaster.
[00:50:49.840 --> 00:50:53.400]   Let's say the police want to see the phone.
[00:50:53.400 --> 00:50:56.240]   All they do is put the phone in your face and then say thank you.
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:50:59.880]   This is a really interesting point, right?
[00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:02.640]   Because this is this is like this is this thing.
[00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:06.680]   This is part of the whole like Apple versus FBI thing.
[00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:12.040]   What we one of the things we learned from that battle was this distinction between what
[00:51:12.040 --> 00:51:14.240]   you are and what you know, right?
[00:51:14.240 --> 00:51:19.080]   And in in in the case of what you are in the courts, the the courts essentially can't
[00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:24.400]   you can be forced to give up your fingerprint, have something look at your face, give up
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:26.840]   your blood, I suppose.
[00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:31.400]   But in terms of what you know, in terms of an alphanumeric code that unlocks your phone,
[00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:36.000]   the authorities can't actually make you provide that or at least not as easily.
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:37.880]   And I think that's really interesting to think about.
[00:51:37.880 --> 00:51:42.880]   I mean, look, I'm not worried necessarily about the authorities coming to banking, kicking
[00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:47.400]   down my door and saying, you know, we need whatever is in your phone.
[00:51:47.400 --> 00:51:50.120]   Look, look, look at your phone so that we can get into it.
[00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:54.200]   But I do think it's something that at least I think about when I think about biometrics
[00:51:54.200 --> 00:52:01.840]   more generally is like, if I have an alphanumeric code, like nobody can force me to give that
[00:52:01.840 --> 00:52:06.960]   over, or at least it's very hard comparatively to biometrics.
[00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:10.480]   And I think biometrics is a little bit could there's a little bit of an Ick factor there
[00:52:10.480 --> 00:52:16.480]   for me, just the fact that that the authorities can much more easily get you to provide that.
[00:52:16.480 --> 00:52:23.720]   I should point out though that this even that putative protection against something you
[00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:26.920]   know, you have or something you know, we know that you know, you can be compelled to give
[00:52:26.920 --> 00:52:31.640]   a fingerprint, a hair for a DNA analysis, all that courts have upheld that that's that
[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:34.720]   doesn't violate your right against self-incrimination.
[00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:38.400]   But you know, there's a guy, a former Philadelphia police officer has been in jail now for two
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:43.720]   years, not because they convicted him of a crime, but because he would not reveal the
[00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:47.120]   password to decrypt his hard drives.
[00:52:47.120 --> 00:52:53.240]   So he's appealed and the courts have upheld the you know, and he will you know, he's on
[00:52:53.240 --> 00:53:00.200]   an indefinite jail term because he's not going to give it up.
[00:53:00.200 --> 00:53:01.200]   Crazy.
[00:53:01.200 --> 00:53:05.080]   So don't don't as I only reason bring that up is don't assume that you know, just because
[00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:06.960]   you only you know the password that that protects you.
[00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:07.960]   They can't punish you.
[00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:08.960]   Yeah.
[00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:09.960]   Yeah, totally totally agree.
[00:53:09.960 --> 00:53:15.440]   Yeah, and I the only person that's concerned about the pricing of this particular phone
[00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:18.520]   or heck any of the other flagship phones of recent.
[00:53:18.520 --> 00:53:21.760]   Yeah, that's it's been slowly ramping up hasn't it?
[00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:26.920]   The note eight is nine hundred thirty to nine hundred sixty bucks getting really close to
[00:53:26.920 --> 00:53:27.920]   a thousand.
[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:31.120]   Dude, my first car was nowhere near that.
[00:53:31.120 --> 00:53:32.400]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:36.680]   I grew up when I grew up, you could buy a Volkswagen brand new for two thousand dollars.
[00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:37.680]   So I can.
[00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:38.680]   Exactly.
[00:53:38.680 --> 00:53:39.680]   How is this even?
[00:53:39.680 --> 00:53:41.440]   I don't quite get it.
[00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:45.840]   I look at the pricing and I tried to think back over the last several years and I remember
[00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:53.360]   the whole conspiracy theory of plan obsolescence or whatever and I don't think it's kind of
[00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:54.360]   digital.
[00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:55.360]   Digital.
[00:53:55.360 --> 00:54:00.520]   You think it's kind of a digital redlining like well, you have to be rich basically to
[00:54:00.520 --> 00:54:02.920]   own a flagship phone.
[00:54:02.920 --> 00:54:08.400]   That's what it sounds like, you know, and I don't think that's fair because it's the
[00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:09.400]   phone.
[00:54:09.400 --> 00:54:10.400]   It's just the phone.
[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:16.640]   Even if it's something like and I love my pixel because it's not only a phone, but
[00:54:16.640 --> 00:54:19.240]   it actually helps me with content creation too.
[00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:20.240]   Right.
[00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:23.120]   You know, but it's still dad gum and expensive man.
[00:54:23.120 --> 00:54:24.120]   Good grief.
[00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:26.240]   We don't know how expensive is coming out.
[00:54:26.240 --> 00:54:31.360]   But and traditionally the rumors about pricing have not been right.
[00:54:31.360 --> 00:54:36.800]   Apple's very good at kind of telegraphing a higher price and then surprising everybody
[00:54:36.800 --> 00:54:42.200]   making everybody feel good about $950 when they're expecting $1200.
[00:54:42.200 --> 00:54:43.400]   And that may be what happens.
[00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:44.400]   But that is the rumor.
[00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:53.120]   $1200 starting price than $1300 for 256 gigs of RAM and $1400 for 512 gigs of RAM.
[00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:54.120]   So crazy.
[00:54:54.120 --> 00:54:56.720]   Well, we paid $500 for phones.
[00:54:56.720 --> 00:55:00.800]   You know, it seemed like it was a decent value because you knew you were going to get at
[00:55:00.800 --> 00:55:04.720]   least two years out of that for those $500 in my opinion.
[00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:05.720]   And sometimes even longer.
[00:55:05.720 --> 00:55:11.440]   I know I've had a few phones that I kept longer than the particular cycle of great cycle came
[00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:12.440]   around.
[00:55:12.440 --> 00:55:14.480]   But now just that's just too much.
[00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:19.320]   I mean, I cringe when I got this pixel, but I've been waiting for maybe three years or
[00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:20.320]   so.
[00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:24.000]   So I'm like, okay, I'm due and I will hold on to this pixel for probably another two
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   more years.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:28.160]   But I just don't know if every consumer feels that way.
[00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:29.320]   It was a disappointment.
[00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:33.320]   I remember when Google announced the price on the pixel though because they had made
[00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:35.200]   less expensive Nexus phones.
[00:55:35.200 --> 00:55:39.520]   There's several generations and all of a sudden the pixel was priced at the same flagship
[00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:42.640]   phone prices, other competing phones.
[00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:50.400]   Has the iPhone always been considered a luxury device though in fairness?
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:58.640]   I mean, like, I take your point and that the, you know, you had a longer relationship with
[00:55:58.640 --> 00:56:00.560]   that phone in the beginning, right?
[00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:03.120]   And it felt like you were getting a lot of bang for your buck.
[00:56:03.120 --> 00:56:09.160]   But I also feel like, I mean, it seems to me like the iPhone has always been considered
[00:56:09.160 --> 00:56:15.520]   to a certain degree a luxury device or a device that's like sort of top of line, right?
[00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:16.880]   The newest iPhone.
[00:56:16.880 --> 00:56:18.600]   Here's what I would say.
[00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:27.640]   What if Apple offers a, as they do now, like the iPhone SE relatively lower cost phone,
[00:56:27.640 --> 00:56:31.520]   medium prices with an iPhone 8 and 8 plus or 7s and 7s plus.
[00:56:31.520 --> 00:56:36.320]   And then, and this is, I feel like I understand they're going to get hit just as they got
[00:56:36.320 --> 00:56:40.360]   hit for the $12, $17,000 Apple watch.
[00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:41.920]   And perhaps rightly so.
[00:56:41.920 --> 00:56:46.240]   But, but on the other hand, I wouldn't mind if Apple said, look, what if we designed a
[00:56:46.240 --> 00:56:50.000]   phone and we just put everything in it that we could, we made it as good as we could without
[00:56:50.000 --> 00:56:53.960]   regard to price and then we're going to charge what we have to charge for it.
[00:56:53.960 --> 00:57:00.120]   But we thought there are some of you who are less price sensitive, who want to see the
[00:57:00.120 --> 00:57:01.560]   state of the state of the yard.
[00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:03.960]   I think I could accept that.
[00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:08.000]   The real problem I have is I don't know if it will be state of the state of the yard.
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   I don't know.
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:12.760]   I mean, look at, we've had OLED screens on phones for years.
[00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:17.280]   They're not the first to do a bezel-less full screen design.
[00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:21.200]   They're dropping, they've already dropped the headphone jack, which I frankly consider
[00:57:21.200 --> 00:57:22.640]   a necessity in a smart.
[00:57:22.640 --> 00:57:23.640]   I hate that.
[00:57:23.640 --> 00:57:25.120]   I hate that they did that.
[00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:26.120]   It's crazy.
[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:31.120]   I hate to drop touch ID, which they made to be the be all and end all of authentication
[00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:32.120]   on a phone.
[00:57:32.120 --> 00:57:34.840]   I don't know if this phone is going to be worth $1,200.
[00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:38.720]   But I wouldn't be against a company saying, look, we're going to just make the best thing
[00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:42.120]   we can regardless of price.
[00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:44.360]   But I don't know if this will be that.
[00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:47.800]   There's a little piece of economic data.
[00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:53.240]   When they introduced the 7 Plus, they broke the rule that every increment was $100 more
[00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:54.240]   than the $100.
[00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:56.560]   They went to $130.
[00:57:56.560 --> 00:58:04.240]   Then they watched to see what economists call the price in elasticity.
[00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:07.480]   They discovered that they sold more of them, not less.
[00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:09.880]   The raising the price didn't hurt them.
[00:58:09.880 --> 00:58:14.400]   In fact, for a lot of different reasons, it went up, not necessarily because of the price.
[00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:20.760]   My guess is $9.99 is probably the entry point for this.
[00:58:20.760 --> 00:58:26.600]   My guess is that price in elasticity will still take effect and they will sell as many
[00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:30.440]   of these things as fast as they can make them into next year.
[00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:36.240]   It'll be a long time until you can buy one of these things just because it won't be available.
[00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:39.960]   That's a good problem to have.
[00:58:39.960 --> 00:58:41.960]   I don't.
[00:58:41.960 --> 00:58:42.960]   Because they want to make money.
[00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:48.440]   Remember when Apple made a Mac book and they made it in the traditional silver and then
[00:58:48.440 --> 00:58:52.000]   they offered a black version of it for $100 more.
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:58.800]   You were paying $100 for paint and it outsold all together models.
[00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:04.600]   Apple's known for a long time this lesson.
[00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:09.640]   The other thing is that Apple has decided that the way they're going to offer cheaper
[00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:19.960]   phones is to keep selling the older versions at a discount.
[00:59:19.960 --> 00:59:22.280]   If you want the premium phone, you're going to have to pay for it.
[00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:28.160]   If you want the iPhone experience, you can get a pretty good one for pretty much the price
[00:59:28.160 --> 00:59:31.040]   of the competition a little bit more.
[00:59:31.040 --> 00:59:36.600]   It is interesting that Google has responded to this with something they call Android One.
[00:59:36.600 --> 00:59:38.880]   There's a couple of features of Android One.
[00:59:38.880 --> 00:59:42.520]   One is that it will be as close to pure Android as possible even though it won't be made by
[00:59:42.520 --> 00:59:47.160]   Google and it will be guaranteed security patches and updates.
[00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:48.800]   The first Android One phone is out.
[00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:52.560]   It's from Motorola, the X4.
[00:59:52.560 --> 00:59:53.800]   It is fairly...
[00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:59.320]   I have to look at the pricing, but I think it's under $400.
[00:59:59.320 --> 01:00:00.640]   Google, I think, understands...
[01:00:00.640 --> 01:00:01.880]   First of all, they understand two things.
[01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:03.880]   One that low priced phones...
[01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:08.880]   Most of the reason Android has so many models out there is most of the Android phones are
[01:00:08.880 --> 01:00:13.320]   low priced, but also that there's an issue with these low priced phones.
[01:00:13.320 --> 01:00:16.600]   They're not getting updates.
[01:00:16.600 --> 01:00:17.760]   This is Evan Blass.
[01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:22.680]   Evan Leakes has leaked this Motorola X4, which is...
[01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:24.600]   On the back, it says powered by Android One.
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:25.760]   I think this is still a leak.
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:29.000]   I don't think this has become official, so I don't know what the price will be.
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:30.680]   That would make a lot of sense.
[01:00:30.680 --> 01:00:32.240]   There's Evan's leak.
[01:00:32.240 --> 01:00:34.720]   If you click on that image, I think it...
[01:00:34.720 --> 01:00:37.120]   Carson, you'll see the full phone at the bottom.
[01:00:37.120 --> 01:00:38.120]   It says Android One.
[01:00:38.120 --> 01:00:40.120]   Yeah, there you go.
[01:00:40.120 --> 01:00:44.680]   My parents both have Motorola's and they're really solid phones.
[01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:48.840]   The G5 is the new one, the E.
[01:00:48.840 --> 01:00:50.640]   These are good phones.
[01:00:50.640 --> 01:00:52.440]   There is a market.
[01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:58.600]   I kind of honor Google and its partners like Motorola for making phones.
[01:00:58.600 --> 01:01:04.400]   People can afford that you don't give up every flagship feature, but as long as those things
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:11.560]   exist or an iPhone SE exists, I do like the idea that there is a phone where we're going
[01:01:11.560 --> 01:01:15.280]   to spare no expense to make the best thing we can make.
[01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:16.680]   How do you like it?
[01:01:16.680 --> 01:01:17.680]   Who else?
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:19.640]   Apple, Apple's got the audience for it.
[01:01:19.640 --> 01:01:21.720]   I don't know.
[01:01:21.720 --> 01:01:24.240]   I understand your point, Ant.
[01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:27.600]   I agree.
[01:01:27.600 --> 01:01:31.040]   The government in the chatroom said there are people who have to buy an iPhone for security
[01:01:31.040 --> 01:01:32.040]   reasons.
[01:01:32.040 --> 01:01:39.760]   Journalists in tough nations where security is paramount, they don't buy Android phones.
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:40.760]   True.
[01:01:40.760 --> 01:01:41.760]   In the US government, a bunch of...
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:42.760]   Isn't the US government...
[01:01:42.760 --> 01:01:46.680]   Haven't they been like the federal government been transitioning to iPhones?
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:47.680]   Yeah.
[01:01:47.680 --> 01:01:48.680]   Over the past five years or something like that.
[01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:49.680]   What do you guys think?
[01:01:49.680 --> 01:01:55.920]   Do you think that Android is that insecure and that iPhone is the only secure solution?
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:02:02.600]   I can't say that it is, but there's always some writing on a wall about an issue with
[01:02:02.600 --> 01:02:03.600]   the Android security.
[01:02:03.600 --> 01:02:04.600]   Seems like it, huh?
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:08.680]   Hardly over here, it's the apple brand is.
[01:02:08.680 --> 01:02:11.680]   Hardly over here is security issues.
[01:02:11.680 --> 01:02:18.000]   It's no accident that Tim Cook made a huge deal about standing up to the FBI.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:20.160]   That was a marketing...
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:21.680]   On brand, very on brand.
[01:02:21.680 --> 01:02:26.640]   Not so you guys believe it, but it's a branding exercise and I think it worked pretty well
[01:02:26.640 --> 01:02:30.440]   for them.
[01:02:30.440 --> 01:02:32.440]   I think so.
[01:02:32.440 --> 01:02:37.000]   I love androids and I use a Mac...
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:43.680]   I've got a Mac laptop, but I've had androids for a long time and I think generally speaking,
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:44.680]   I'm okay.
[01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:50.720]   I like the customizability and so I'm generally speaking, I'm okay with dealing with some of
[01:02:50.720 --> 01:02:54.240]   the security challenges or at least being...
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:57.840]   I'm okay with taking that risk, but generally speaking at your eye...
[01:02:57.840 --> 01:03:00.360]   You're the most cognizant of the security challenges though.
[01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:01.720]   You're not the average user.
[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:04.480]   You're at least aware of the security issues.
[01:03:04.480 --> 01:03:05.800]   Exactly, exactly.
[01:03:05.800 --> 01:03:11.520]   I do think like as you said before, I think you were saying that you recommend people,
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:17.800]   depending on their how serious of a user they are, an iPhone is a really good option in some
[01:03:17.800 --> 01:03:18.800]   ways.
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:23.120]   I think that the obvious users use iPhones too, but I think that generally speaking, it does
[01:03:23.120 --> 01:03:26.920]   seem fair to say that iPhones are more secure.
[01:03:26.920 --> 01:03:29.880]   You know who's big fans of the iPhone?
[01:03:29.880 --> 01:03:30.880]   The Boston Red Sox.
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:33.320]   Oh, this story was the best.
[01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:34.880]   I love this story.
[01:03:34.880 --> 01:03:37.280]   It's kind of goofy because you can...
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:39.640]   So the Red Sox have been accused of stealing signs.
[01:03:39.640 --> 01:03:41.960]   This is in baseball.
[01:03:41.960 --> 01:03:43.280]   This happens in football too.
[01:03:43.280 --> 01:03:48.960]   In baseball, the catcher sends signs to the pitcher, what pitch to throw.
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:53.880]   Coaches will send signs to base runners and hitters as to what to do in the next play.
[01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:57.400]   If the opposing team could figure out what the plans were, it'd be a lot easier to get
[01:03:57.400 --> 01:03:58.720]   guys out.
[01:03:58.720 --> 01:04:02.160]   Apparently, the Red Sox were sent...
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:03.160]   I don't know.
[01:04:03.160 --> 01:04:06.480]   Phillip, you talk about this on your blog.
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:07.480]   What were they doing?
[01:04:07.480 --> 01:04:08.480]   Were they texting each?
[01:04:08.480 --> 01:04:12.080]   I mean, it really didn't require an Apple watch to do this, right?
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:17.240]   Well, I think my assumption, because if you're texting, you might as well use hand signals.
[01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:18.880]   Why get fancy?
[01:04:18.880 --> 01:04:23.000]   My assumption was that they were sending video to the Apple Watch.
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:29.320]   What I love is that Tim Cook had visited the Red Sox dugout.
[01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:32.600]   I don't know how much earlier, but they'd given him a...
[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:36.920]   He was wearing a whole Red Sox uniform and a Red Sox hat and he posed with them.
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:40.120]   I can just see Cook saying, "Look, look what you can do with this watch.
[01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:42.720]   You can actually send video through it."
[01:04:42.720 --> 01:04:45.160]   There's no camera on the watch.
[01:04:45.160 --> 01:04:48.320]   The video can't be taken by the watch, but you could show video.
[01:04:48.320 --> 01:04:49.320]   No, it's...
[01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:50.320]   Right.
[01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:51.320]   You can send it from the...
[01:04:51.320 --> 01:04:52.320]   So this is what the New York Times said.
[01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:56.060]   "The Yankees, who had long been suspicious of the Red Sox stealing catcher's signs in
[01:04:56.060 --> 01:05:01.800]   Fenway Park, said that there was video from the broadcast, I believe, showing a member
[01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:07.680]   of the Red Sox training staff looking at his Apple Watch in the dugout and then relaying
[01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:11.280]   a message to other players in the dugout who would signal teammates in the field about
[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:13.440]   the kind of pitch he was going to get."
[01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:14.440]   Something happened.
[01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:17.840]   The way I understood the story, and I'm not a baseball expert, but the way I understood
[01:05:17.840 --> 01:05:22.720]   the story was somebody at second base was hand signaling.
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:23.720]   Does this make sense?
[01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:24.720]   No, no.
[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:25.720]   This is what...
[01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:28.760]   No, the commissioner's office confronted the Red Sox who admitted their trainers had received
[01:05:28.760 --> 01:05:36.200]   signals from video replay personnel and then relayed that information to Red Sox players.
[01:05:36.200 --> 01:05:40.360]   This has been going on for several weeks, and apparently, you know, they obviously, the
[01:05:40.360 --> 01:05:44.960]   video replay personnel had iPhones, which they would then either send the image or it
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:46.920]   would be just as easy to say.
[01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:51.880]   It's going to be, you know, a fastball high and inside in a text message that the trainer
[01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:53.920]   could then see in the watch.
[01:05:53.920 --> 01:06:01.480]   The Red Sox responded by filing a complaint against the Yankees saying the team uses a
[01:06:01.480 --> 01:06:07.320]   camera from its Yes Television Network exclusively, like a dedicated camera to steal signs during
[01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:08.320]   the game.
[01:06:08.320 --> 01:06:09.320]   The Yankees denied it.
[01:06:09.320 --> 01:06:12.680]   I don't think the Apple Watch really is a big part of this story, but I thought it was
[01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:13.680]   funny.
[01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:16.400]   The Apple Watch even made the tabloids.
[01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:23.320]   Dirty Sox, Apple caught Red-handed using Apple Watch to cheat versus Yanks.
[01:06:23.320 --> 01:06:24.320]   This must be...
[01:06:24.320 --> 01:06:27.000]   Is this the Daily News, Philip, or the post?
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.000]   It's all of them.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000]   It's all of them.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000]   All the New York Dailys.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.200]   How do you like them apples?
[01:06:31.200 --> 01:06:37.760]   Red Sox, Fessup, they even have an Apple Watch with a Boston Red Sox watch band saying Wicked
[01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:38.760]   Kev coming.
[01:06:38.760 --> 01:06:43.960]   This is like the techiest version of Red Sox suck.
[01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:45.920]   No yankie suck.
[01:06:45.920 --> 01:06:48.760]   It just cracked.
[01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:49.760]   Wicked Kev coming.
[01:06:49.760 --> 01:06:50.760]   Watch out there.
[01:06:50.760 --> 01:06:51.760]   Wow.
[01:06:51.760 --> 01:06:52.760]   Wow.
[01:06:52.760 --> 01:06:59.400]   But did you know that it's against league rules to use any electronics in the dugout?
[01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:00.400]   So that's it.
[01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:01.400]   It's really...
[01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:02.400]   That's antique.
[01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:05.880]   That's why this is an important story because an Apple Watch, which could ostensibly just
[01:07:05.880 --> 01:07:08.680]   be a wrist watch, is in fact an electronic device.
[01:07:08.680 --> 01:07:09.680]   Yeah.
[01:07:09.680 --> 01:07:10.680]   But you can't use iPhones.
[01:07:10.680 --> 01:07:11.680]   You can't use...
[01:07:11.680 --> 01:07:12.680]   Well, there you go.
[01:07:12.680 --> 01:07:13.680]   They can use telephones.
[01:07:13.680 --> 01:07:14.680]   There's one telephone they can use.
[01:07:14.680 --> 01:07:16.120]   So that's why this is important.
[01:07:16.120 --> 01:07:18.800]   This was a way that they could send that text message or whatever.
[01:07:18.800 --> 01:07:20.400]   A video or a text message.
[01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:22.320]   It seems like you'd send a text message.
[01:07:22.320 --> 01:07:24.480]   Well, the text, you'd have to type it.
[01:07:24.480 --> 01:07:25.480]   That would take so long.
[01:07:25.480 --> 01:07:27.120]   No, the watch.
[01:07:27.120 --> 01:07:28.600]   The guys in the video booth go.
[01:07:28.600 --> 01:07:30.600]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:31.600]   And then they...
[01:07:31.600 --> 01:07:32.600]   I don't know.
[01:07:32.600 --> 01:07:34.840]   Maybe you're saying they sent a picture of the signal.
[01:07:34.840 --> 01:07:38.200]   I think the live signal of the guy...
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:39.920]   What the catcher is doing.
[01:07:39.920 --> 01:07:40.920]   Yeah.
[01:07:40.920 --> 01:07:41.920]   Yeah.
[01:07:41.920 --> 01:07:42.920]   That's crazy.
[01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:44.360]   Because you're in the dugout, you can't see it right.
[01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:48.200]   He's hiding it down here in his crotch.
[01:07:48.200 --> 01:07:49.200]   Okay.
[01:07:49.200 --> 01:07:53.000]   Well, I just thought that was the cutest story of the week.
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.000]   It's innovating.
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.000]   Innovation.
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:57.000]   Courage, my friends.
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.000]   Courage.
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.240]   Apple has also canceled the Apple Music Festival.
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:01.600]   I'd say to hear that.
[01:08:01.600 --> 01:08:04.920]   For 10 years, Apple had been doing these great live all through the month of September
[01:08:04.920 --> 01:08:07.160]   live concerts that you could watch on iTunes.
[01:08:07.160 --> 01:08:08.720]   Pre-Croncings.
[01:08:08.720 --> 01:08:12.160]   We went, Lisa and I were going to be in London towards the end of September.
[01:08:12.160 --> 01:08:18.680]   A couple of years ago, we asked our friends at the iTunes, James, over that iTunes.
[01:08:18.680 --> 01:08:19.680]   Could you get us in?
[01:08:19.680 --> 01:08:20.680]   We went to a show.
[01:08:20.680 --> 01:08:23.120]   It was really fun in the Roundhouse in London.
[01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:24.680]   And they do a beautiful job of streaming it.
[01:08:24.680 --> 01:08:25.680]   But I guess...
[01:08:25.680 --> 01:08:32.160]   Well, someone in my chat room said that it wasn't so much that they were giving up on
[01:08:32.160 --> 01:08:35.920]   this is that they had pivoted to some new business model.
[01:08:35.920 --> 01:08:39.400]   I don't know if it's Carpool, karaoke, or some...
[01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:40.400]   I hope it's fine.
[01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:41.400]   They want to...
[01:08:41.400 --> 01:08:42.400]   Plan it on the apps.
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:43.400]   The trouble with this is not...
[01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:44.400]   Yeah, me too.
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:49.960]   But the trouble with the Roundhouse, it was just very local.
[01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:53.240]   Only someone in London could see it unless he streamed it.
[01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:54.960]   And they now have...
[01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:55.960]   They really want to...
[01:08:55.960 --> 01:09:02.680]   They're competing with the other music streamers and they've got to find some edge, something
[01:09:02.680 --> 01:09:07.000]   that they can do exclusive for Apple Music or they're going to die.
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.000]   Yeah.
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.480]   All right, we're going to stop with the Apple.
[01:09:09.480 --> 01:09:11.480]   I know you've all...
[01:09:11.480 --> 01:09:14.120]   We always have the people say, "Okay, you talked about Apple for an hour.
[01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:15.360]   Okay, we're done with the Apple.
[01:09:15.360 --> 01:09:17.640]   We're going to talk about Russia and Facebook.
[01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:20.760]   We're going to talk about, of course, about Equifax and a lot more.
[01:09:20.760 --> 01:09:23.360]   We've got a great panel here, Philip Elmer to wit.
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:25.680]   He says, "Okay," because he's like, "I don't have anything else to say.
[01:09:25.680 --> 01:09:26.680]   Is that it?"
[01:09:26.680 --> 01:09:27.680]   Like, "Go home now, right?"
[01:09:27.680 --> 01:09:28.680]   "Go home."
[01:09:28.680 --> 01:09:30.120]   "No, no, stay, stay, please."
[01:09:30.120 --> 01:09:32.720]   PED30, his great new website.
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:33.720]   I call it new.
[01:09:33.720 --> 01:09:35.400]   You've been doing it for a while now, right?
[01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:36.800]   You're in a half.
[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:37.800]   Yeah.
[01:09:37.800 --> 01:09:38.800]   It feels new to me.
[01:09:38.800 --> 01:09:39.800]   Yeah.
[01:09:39.800 --> 01:09:41.320]   It feels new to me every morning.
[01:09:41.320 --> 01:09:42.320]   Yeah.
[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:47.720]   And soon he'll be getting an early morning flight to Cupertino for the Big Apple event on
[01:09:47.720 --> 01:09:48.720]   Tuesday.
[01:09:48.720 --> 01:09:50.720]   And we'll get you back on soon to get your...
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:53.520]   Because one of the reasons you want to go to that event is they have the demo room.
[01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:55.600]   You can go play with it and all that.
[01:09:55.600 --> 01:09:56.600]   Yeah.
[01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:58.200]   You can show it your face.
[01:09:58.200 --> 01:10:02.720]   Somebody said, "Here's how you make the iPhone secure, the face recognition is secure,
[01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:06.880]   as you make a face when you're signing it up, you're gone."
[01:10:06.880 --> 01:10:10.560]   And then it doesn't work unless you make that same face.
[01:10:10.560 --> 01:10:13.840]   And that way you're safe, because no one will know what face to make.
[01:10:13.840 --> 01:10:18.040]   Well, apparently it's using 3D so that...
[01:10:18.040 --> 01:10:20.400]   I want you to try that, would you?
[01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:21.400]   The only negative is...
[01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:22.680]   Yeah, it's the final clown mask.
[01:10:22.680 --> 01:10:25.920]   Then from then on, anytime you want to unlock your phone, you have to go.
[01:10:25.920 --> 01:10:31.920]   People are going to think, "Hey, he's a nice guy, but does he have a tick?
[01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:34.640]   What is going on there?"
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:37.520]   Ben Johnson also here from Code Breaker, the podcast.
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:39.360]   It's great to have him.
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:40.360]   Somebody...
[01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:41.360]   Great to be here.
[01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:42.360]   Wanting to get on for a long time.
[01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:43.360]   So nice to have you.
[01:10:43.360 --> 01:10:47.040]   And speaking of getting on for a long time, Ant Pruitt, one of the best photographers drone
[01:10:47.040 --> 01:10:50.080]   guys out there, he's a contributing radio tech republic.
[01:10:50.080 --> 01:10:52.800]   And it's been a long overdue getting you on the show.
[01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:55.320]   Thank you for joining us with your Barry White voice.
[01:10:55.320 --> 01:10:56.320]   I like that.
[01:10:56.320 --> 01:10:57.320]   Thank you, sir.
[01:10:57.320 --> 01:10:58.320]   Thank you.
[01:10:58.320 --> 01:11:01.600]   Just say, just for me, just say, "When a man and a woman..."
[01:11:01.600 --> 01:11:04.840]   No, no, I'm actually better not.
[01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:06.960]   You get a whole different rate of breath.
[01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:07.960]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:13.120]   You know, baby, I love it when you come close to me.
[01:11:13.120 --> 01:11:14.120]   I'm sorry.
[01:11:14.120 --> 01:11:19.120]   I'm sorry.
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:22.680]   Or you're looking to hire a tech professional or anybody in any business, there's no better
[01:11:22.680 --> 01:11:24.400]   way than ZipperKruder.
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:27.240]   You might say, "Well, I know, you know, I'm going to hire.
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:30.280]   I'll go to the site where those people hang out or whatever."
[01:11:30.280 --> 01:11:31.960]   But it doesn't work that way.
[01:11:31.960 --> 01:11:36.440]   The perfect employee might be out there, but just not looking at the job site you posted
[01:11:36.440 --> 01:11:37.440]   to.
[01:11:37.440 --> 01:11:38.440]   So why not use ZipperKruder?
[01:11:38.440 --> 01:11:41.160]   It posts to 100+ job sites with one click.
[01:11:41.160 --> 01:11:42.920]   ZipperKruder puts it everywhere.
[01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:45.360]   You have the maximum reach.
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:51.440]   Even Twitter and Facebook, the most people will see that job posting, which almost guarantees
[01:11:51.440 --> 01:11:53.120]   that that right person will see it.
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:56.640]   That's the one you want, the guy or gal who's perfect for that job.
[01:11:56.640 --> 01:11:59.040]   Now you might say, "Well, hey, that's finally..."
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:02.480]   But is this mean my phone's going to ring off the hook and my inbox overflowed?
[01:12:02.480 --> 01:12:04.920]   No, no, no, that's the beauty of this.
[01:12:04.920 --> 01:12:08.640]   Because all of those candidates pour into the ZipperKruder interface.
[01:12:08.640 --> 01:12:09.640]   They don't call you.
[01:12:09.640 --> 01:12:10.640]   They don't email you.
[01:12:10.640 --> 01:12:12.560]   It goes to the ZipperKruder interface.
[01:12:12.560 --> 01:12:16.520]   You can screen them with true, false, yes, no essay questions.
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:22.200]   You can eliminate people who don't work, rank the rest, hire the right person fast.

[01:13:17.120 --> 01:13:21.520]   We thank them so much for their support.
[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:23.000]   Equifax.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:27.040]   I just all like to shake my head.
[01:13:27.040 --> 01:13:32.480]   So first of all, people spend so much time, we spend so much time talking about privacy
[01:13:32.480 --> 01:13:35.280]   and how Google knows everything or Facebook knows everything.
[01:13:35.280 --> 01:13:39.120]   At least with Google and Facebook, you know what you're giving them this information.
[01:13:39.120 --> 01:13:41.920]   And you know what they're doing with it.
[01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:46.740]   But who knew there were three, actually four, I found out now there's a fourth company in
[01:13:46.740 --> 01:13:52.320]   this country whose sole job it is, is to collect every possible bit of information about you
[01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:57.580]   and you and all of us and then sell it to other companies.
[01:13:57.580 --> 01:14:00.080]   That's what the credit reporting agencies do.
[01:14:00.080 --> 01:14:01.200]   Equifax is just one of them.
[01:14:01.200 --> 01:14:05.840]   There's TransUnion, Experian.
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:10.000]   Equifax.com, oh and this new one that I never heard of but I found out on the New York Times,
[01:14:10.000 --> 01:14:11.840]   is it A Novus?
[01:14:11.840 --> 01:14:14.560]   So they're, they, I understand why we have to.
[01:14:14.560 --> 01:14:19.160]   It's a necessary evil because if you're going to go try to buy a car or a house or rent
[01:14:19.160 --> 01:14:23.760]   a car or rent a house, get a job, sometimes they'll do a credit report on you even to
[01:14:23.760 --> 01:14:26.400]   get hired.
[01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:28.920]   Companies need to find out are you a credit worthy?
[01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:31.000]   Are you a worthwhile risk?
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:33.200]   So that's what these agencies do.
[01:14:33.200 --> 01:14:37.720]   They collect all that information and then companies come to them and say, "Tell me all
[01:14:37.720 --> 01:14:38.720]   about Leo.
[01:14:38.720 --> 01:14:40.640]   Can I lend him money?"
[01:14:40.640 --> 01:14:45.040]   They also have a side business, pretty lucrative side business I'm told, selling your information
[01:14:45.040 --> 01:14:47.440]   to companies that want to give you free credit card offers.
[01:14:47.440 --> 01:14:49.640]   You ever get a free credit card offer in the mail?
[01:14:49.640 --> 01:14:52.440]   Well, where do they get your information from?
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:55.240]   Experian Equifax TransUnion.
[01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:57.080]   That's, that's their business.
[01:14:57.080 --> 01:14:59.880]   All right, I understand.
[01:14:59.880 --> 01:15:06.200]   Free evil, capitalist economy, we got to have these guys, but you're, if you're going to
[01:15:06.200 --> 01:15:13.440]   be, do this kind of skeasy business, you have a very high responsibility to protect that
[01:15:13.440 --> 01:15:14.440]   data.
[01:15:14.440 --> 01:15:16.840]   That's what I didn't understand.
[01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:17.840]   Didn't they have?
[01:15:17.840 --> 01:15:19.800]   Well, let me ask it this way.
[01:15:19.800 --> 01:15:23.640]   Do they have some type of compliance in place that they're supposed to follow the way all
[01:15:23.640 --> 01:15:26.320]   of our other financial institutions in the US?
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:27.520]   That's a good question.
[01:15:27.520 --> 01:15:29.800]   Apparently not.
[01:15:29.800 --> 01:15:40.600]   Equifax told us all this week that 143 million customer records had been stolen by hackers.
[01:15:40.600 --> 01:15:42.000]   I bet you that number's low.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.040]   I bet you that number goes up over time.
[01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:45.720]   We've seen that before.
[01:15:45.720 --> 01:15:48.840]   Apparently, this is the, I love this.
[01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:49.840]   This is Dan.
[01:15:49.840 --> 01:15:55.520]   Dan, good news article on Arts Technica with a guy trying to stem the flow from a pipe,
[01:15:55.520 --> 01:15:57.040]   not very effectively.
[01:15:57.040 --> 01:16:02.160]   Apparently, they, Equifax knew about it July 29th.
[01:16:02.160 --> 01:16:07.360]   Shortly thereafter, three Equifax employees, including their chief financial officer, sold
[01:16:07.360 --> 01:16:13.600]   stock worth millions of dollars.
[01:16:13.600 --> 01:16:18.320]   And then they revealed it publicly and of course, the stock price tumbled.
[01:16:18.320 --> 01:16:20.080]   I think that sounds like insider trading.
[01:16:20.080 --> 01:16:22.840]   Equifax said, oh no, those guys didn't know.
[01:16:22.840 --> 01:16:25.440]   You see if, oh really, you see if I did not know.
[01:16:25.440 --> 01:16:26.440]   Okay.
[01:16:26.440 --> 01:16:31.840]   I'm sure the SEC will have something to say about that later.
[01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:33.240]   Five weeks they knew about this.
[01:16:33.240 --> 01:16:34.760]   They didn't tell us right there.
[01:16:34.760 --> 01:16:38.400]   That's a problem because the minute that stuff goes out into the dark net and is being traded
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:39.960]   by hackers, you're at risk.
[01:16:39.960 --> 01:16:40.960]   We're all at risk.
[01:16:40.960 --> 01:16:43.320]   Mother's maiden name, social security number.
[01:16:43.320 --> 01:16:49.520]   In some cases, credit card numbers, phone numbers, addresses.
[01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:53.080]   Equifax has not been very upfront about what information was leaked, how this information
[01:16:53.080 --> 01:16:55.400]   was retrieved, why it took them so long to respond.
[01:16:55.400 --> 01:16:56.800]   They really haven't said much at all.
[01:16:56.800 --> 01:17:01.920]   In fact, the only thing Equifax did is set up a website which I'm not going to give you
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:08.120]   because you shouldn't go there that you can enter in the last six.
[01:17:08.120 --> 01:17:10.280]   There's only nine in your social security number.
[01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:12.880]   Last six digits, no, there's 10, right?
[01:17:12.880 --> 01:17:16.680]   All but the first three digits of your social and your last name and then they would say,
[01:17:16.680 --> 01:17:23.680]   oh, you were affected or no, you weren't except that Brian Krebs entered a random number and
[01:17:23.680 --> 01:17:26.640]   Donald Trump's name and it said, oh, yeah, you've been affected.
[01:17:26.640 --> 01:17:28.560]   It's random apparently.
[01:17:28.560 --> 01:17:31.160]   It doesn't work or it has nothing to do with anything.
[01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:36.000]   And then they immediately send you to a site where they offer you a year of free credit
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:38.400]   monitoring a year which will.
[01:17:38.400 --> 01:17:44.000]   I'm sure in a year and a day, they're going to say, and by the way, that's $39.95 from
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.000]   now on.
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.840]   And they're trying to make money on this.
[01:17:47.840 --> 01:17:48.840]   So silly.
[01:17:48.840 --> 01:17:53.240]   They asked people to agree to terms of service, right?
[01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:54.240]   Didn't they?
[01:17:54.240 --> 01:17:56.320]   Well, this is a little questionable.
[01:17:56.320 --> 01:17:58.760]   Equifax said that we with this doesn't apply to the breach.
[01:17:58.760 --> 01:18:02.040]   This only applies to this new trusted ID service.
[01:18:02.040 --> 01:18:06.680]   However, they said in the if you sign up for trusted ID, which you should not absolutely
[01:18:06.680 --> 01:18:07.680]   should not do.
[01:18:07.680 --> 01:18:09.680]   You should not give in the last six of your social.
[01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:13.960]   You shouldn't have anything to do with Equifax at all if you can help it.
[01:18:13.960 --> 01:18:19.240]   What they said is, well, you can't sue us.
[01:18:19.240 --> 01:18:22.520]   You can't have a class action lawsuit against us as only arbitration.
[01:18:22.520 --> 01:18:25.000]   But I think a, experts agree that's not binding.
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:27.880]   You can still sue the hell out of them and should.
[01:18:27.880 --> 01:18:30.720]   And it doesn't apply to the breach.
[01:18:30.720 --> 01:18:32.240]   It only applies to trusted ID.
[01:18:32.240 --> 01:18:33.240]   Don't deal with Equifax.
[01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:37.200]   Don't make any agreements at all with Equifax, period.
[01:18:37.200 --> 01:18:42.480]   A great example of just how a company, even still, I mean, it seems like when are we going
[01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:48.280]   to get to the point where companies of this size understand how to deal with stuff like
[01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:49.280]   this?
[01:18:49.280 --> 01:18:54.320]   I think we're still, it still feels like we're in the days where I can't remember a large
[01:18:54.320 --> 01:19:00.480]   company that's been affected and so many of them have that nailed their response to
[01:19:00.480 --> 01:19:03.240]   this kind of thing, right?
[01:19:03.240 --> 01:19:09.800]   And I think the other thing that's scary to me is the, like over time, there's a profile
[01:19:09.800 --> 01:19:15.040]   that gets built up about each individual user depending on different hacks that happen,
[01:19:15.040 --> 01:19:16.040]   right?
[01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:20.120]   Maybe there's a part of your profile gets stolen over here and it's just your mother's
[01:19:20.120 --> 01:19:22.120]   maiden name and your telephone number.
[01:19:22.120 --> 01:19:26.200]   And then another hack over here gets your social security number.
[01:19:26.200 --> 01:19:31.320]   And eventually there's, there's a incremental thing that's happening here to users all over
[01:19:31.320 --> 01:19:33.080]   the place that I think is really scary.
[01:19:33.080 --> 01:19:38.960]   And at the same time, so many users are becoming less and less, they're becoming desensitized
[01:19:38.960 --> 01:19:43.600]   to these stories because it seems like there's one every month.
[01:19:43.600 --> 01:19:49.440]   And I think both of those things, yeah, yeah, yeah, both of those things freak me out.
[01:19:49.440 --> 01:19:55.120]   Well, I don't think it's a, it's a state secret how to secure data.
[01:19:55.120 --> 01:19:59.080]   Excuse me, but I think that we know how to do this.
[01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:04.920]   Have you ever heard of a breach of your data from Google or Facebook?
[01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:11.120]   I feel like we know how to encrypt data, how to secure it.
[01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:13.280]   We don't know how the hackers got in.
[01:20:13.280 --> 01:20:17.360]   One of the stories I saw said that Equifax said they got in through their website, which
[01:20:17.360 --> 01:20:19.160]   is of, which bodes very poorly.
[01:20:19.160 --> 01:20:24.280]   The special site they set up has security flaws of its own and the JavaScript is the
[01:20:24.280 --> 01:20:25.920]   login name for the site.
[01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:30.400]   I mean, these guys are obviously inept.
[01:20:30.400 --> 01:20:31.400]   I agree with you, Ant.
[01:20:31.400 --> 01:20:36.160]   There should be, there should be some, some require, some federal requirements for privacy
[01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:38.720]   and security for these companies.
[01:20:38.720 --> 01:20:43.640]   But maybe one of the reasons they haven't is that Equifax, along with all the others,
[01:20:43.640 --> 01:20:48.640]   is a big contributor to Republican congressmen, to lawmakers.
[01:20:48.640 --> 01:20:57.040]   They've, since the creation of the CFPB, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, Equifax
[01:20:57.040 --> 01:21:03.080]   has donated more than half a million dollars in campaign cash, trying to get Republicans
[01:21:03.080 --> 01:21:06.560]   to put the CFPB out of business.
[01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:16.400]   The CFPB was created after the deplorable financial crisis of 2008 to protect Americans
[01:21:16.400 --> 01:21:19.400]   to force disclosures.
[01:21:19.400 --> 01:21:27.000]   They, Equifax has been lobbying, for instance, to repeal the rule that requires them to be
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:29.640]   suitable.
[01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:34.560]   They want to repeal the agency entirely.
[01:21:34.560 --> 01:21:36.320]   The FTC has been on this too, right?
[01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:42.360]   I mean, the FTC has been, has been trying, I think, you know, I've interviewed a few times
[01:21:42.360 --> 01:21:45.720]   chair, former chairwoman, Edith Ramirez.
[01:21:45.720 --> 01:21:52.120]   And you know, I think that the FTC has been, has been trying to force change about this
[01:21:52.120 --> 01:21:53.120]   for a long time.
[01:21:53.120 --> 01:21:56.360]   They've been talking about data privacy for a long time.
[01:21:56.360 --> 01:22:03.640]   And, and the problem is just like the FCC and the net neutrality debate, this, this stuff
[01:22:03.640 --> 01:22:07.040]   is really hard to do through the agency.
[01:22:07.040 --> 01:22:10.360]   It needs to happen through an act of Congress quite literally.
[01:22:10.360 --> 01:22:13.640]   And for reasons that you're describing, Leo.
[01:22:13.640 --> 01:22:16.400]   Congress is in the back pockets of companies like Equifax.
[01:22:16.400 --> 01:22:24.840]   Look at this bill, HR 2359, Barry Lauter, milk of Georgia introduced this May 4th, the
[01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:29.080]   to amend civil liability requirements under the Fair Credit Reporting Act to limit class
[01:22:29.080 --> 01:22:38.240]   action lawsuit payments to $500,000 with no punitive amounts.
[01:22:38.240 --> 01:22:43.600]   I mean, this is, this is clearly something written by companies like Equifax and put through
[01:22:43.600 --> 01:22:48.440]   with their team members of Congress to protect them against this kind of event.
[01:22:48.440 --> 01:22:49.440]   By the way, good news.
[01:22:49.440 --> 01:22:53.680]   There's a massive class action lawsuit that's been filed against Equifax.
[01:22:53.680 --> 01:22:56.240]   I think it was at $70 billion.
[01:22:56.240 --> 01:23:01.560]   I have to, members of Congress, of course, have asked them to come in and testify.
[01:23:01.560 --> 01:23:06.080]   I just don't feel like Equifax has did the right thing in the first place protecting us,
[01:23:06.080 --> 01:23:13.080]   has done the right thing in the response to it and is being forthright in any way about
[01:23:13.080 --> 01:23:16.160]   what information was leaked.
[01:23:16.160 --> 01:23:21.320]   Who does Equifax answer to with regards to this?
[01:23:21.320 --> 01:23:26.840]   And secondly, why did they wait so long to release the information?
[01:23:26.840 --> 01:23:33.160]   And I know you have to have some type of investigation before you tell the press, you know, we had
[01:23:33.160 --> 01:23:37.520]   a breach because you want all of the facts to be there, but it took them a month to get
[01:23:37.520 --> 01:23:38.520]   the facts straight.
[01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:39.520]   Yeah.
[01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:41.360]   It's more than a month.
[01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:45.000]   Also, also, if my security is breached, I want to be notified.
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:46.000]   Yes.
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:50.160]   I don't want to have to go to a website and ask and then turn it away right.
[01:23:50.160 --> 01:23:51.760]   Somebody saying this isn't the first time.
[01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:55.120]   This is the third time Equifax has been hacked.
[01:23:55.120 --> 01:24:00.280]   So I surely have no problem calling you to offer you a bunch of things you don't want.
[01:24:00.280 --> 01:24:04.200]   You can go down and say, "Hey, you've been hacked."
[01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:06.200]   You have my number Equifax.
[01:24:06.200 --> 01:24:07.760]   You have my number.
[01:24:07.760 --> 01:24:08.760]   They do.
[01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:09.760]   They do that.
[01:24:09.760 --> 01:24:13.720]   They were hacked in 2015.
[01:24:13.720 --> 01:24:20.160]   It just feels like there's no accountability at all.
[01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:21.160]   Unbelievable.
[01:24:21.160 --> 01:24:23.240]   In 2015, 15 million.
[01:24:23.240 --> 01:24:25.600]   Oh, no, this was an Equifax.
[01:24:25.600 --> 01:24:26.600]   This was an Equifax.
[01:24:26.600 --> 01:24:29.600]   In 2015, Experian was hacked.
[01:24:29.600 --> 01:24:33.080]   15 million customer records were exfiltrated.
[01:24:33.080 --> 01:24:39.200]   143 million, pretty much as every adult in the US as close as it could be, which tells
[01:24:39.200 --> 01:24:42.880]   me that they lost the entire database.
[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:44.720]   So why are they saying, "Oh, don't worry.
[01:24:44.720 --> 01:24:46.840]   Only 222,000 people lost.
[01:24:46.840 --> 01:24:49.560]   The credit cards numbers were lost."
[01:24:49.560 --> 01:24:51.880]   I want to know a little bit more about that.
[01:24:51.880 --> 01:24:53.880]   They probably have a credit card.
[01:24:53.880 --> 01:24:54.880]   Yeah.
[01:24:54.880 --> 01:25:03.000]   In some ways, too, your credit card number is in some ways the least valuable part.
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:07.840]   At least to me, I can call my credit card company and say, "These charges are BS."
[01:25:07.840 --> 01:25:10.080]   Good luck in a new social.
[01:25:10.080 --> 01:25:11.080]   That's fun.
[01:25:11.080 --> 01:25:12.080]   Exactly.
[01:25:12.080 --> 01:25:18.440]   So there's a couple of ways you can really socket to them.
[01:25:18.440 --> 01:25:24.760]   My suggestion is you can do a fraud alert on your account that you have to renew every
[01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:25.760]   few months.
[01:25:25.760 --> 01:25:31.040]   Rules vary state to state on this, but that you usually have to renew every three months.
[01:25:31.040 --> 01:25:35.560]   And that means they have to notify you when anybody pulls a credit report on you.
[01:25:35.560 --> 01:25:37.400]   Even better, credit freeze.
[01:25:37.400 --> 01:25:42.560]   In some states, you have to pay for this as much as $10 to freeze your credit per reporting
[01:25:42.560 --> 01:25:43.560]   company.
[01:25:43.560 --> 01:25:45.680]   So that'd be $30 for the big three.
[01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:49.720]   And then to unfreeze it, in which you need to do if you want to get a loan, is another
[01:25:49.720 --> 01:25:50.720]   $10 each.
[01:25:50.720 --> 01:25:52.360]   So it's not cheap.
[01:25:52.360 --> 01:25:54.040]   Although again, in some states, it's free.
[01:25:54.040 --> 01:25:58.320]   It depends on how the state legislature ruled on this.
[01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:05.880]   But a credit freeze means they can't give anybody your credit information and would completely
[01:26:05.880 --> 01:26:09.360]   eliminate their ability to make money, which is why they make this a very hard thing to
[01:26:09.360 --> 01:26:10.360]   do.
[01:26:10.360 --> 01:26:11.720]   But it might be worthwhile.
[01:26:11.720 --> 01:26:19.400]   Well, if you go to the state of California has a great page on credit freezing and fraud
[01:26:19.400 --> 01:26:24.720]   alerts, and they have links to all three credit freeze pages, you should be aware, though,
[01:26:24.720 --> 01:26:28.040]   that if you're going to get a credit freeze, the way you get it is by giving them all your
[01:26:28.040 --> 01:26:34.240]   information because they don't have to know it's you.
[01:26:34.240 --> 01:26:39.960]   New York Times says three hacks of Equifax were disclosed by Equifax this year.
[01:26:39.960 --> 01:26:44.800]   Yeah, I don't even know where to begin.
[01:26:44.800 --> 01:26:45.800]   It's just appalling.
[01:26:45.800 --> 01:26:49.960]   It's as flat as you get.
[01:26:49.960 --> 01:26:52.400]   You used to rob banks because that's where the money is.
[01:26:52.400 --> 01:26:55.600]   You rob Equifax because that's where the social security numbers are.
[01:26:55.600 --> 01:26:58.880]   Data is better than money nowadays, isn't it?
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:01.480]   I agree with that.
[01:27:01.480 --> 01:27:06.640]   When I'm not doing any content creation, I'm writing SQL.
[01:27:06.640 --> 01:27:12.320]   I think about all the data that I see during the day and just how valuable that is.
[01:27:12.320 --> 01:27:18.000]   It's way more valuable than me walking out there and finding somebody's wallet with a
[01:27:18.000 --> 01:27:19.400]   few bucks in it.
[01:27:19.400 --> 01:27:24.200]   I have all of this private information that could lead to a bunch of other information
[01:27:24.200 --> 01:27:32.160]   that could bring me a wealth of money if I was that type of person.
[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:33.440]   By the way, that's a hell of a skill.
[01:27:33.440 --> 01:27:38.600]   If you can write SQL queries, I'm sure there's some Russian hackers who would love to offer
[01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:40.600]   you a job or a job.
[01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:43.720]   You said the website was how they got through.
[01:27:43.720 --> 01:27:45.160]   That was the first thing that come to my mind.
[01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:46.640]   I was in SQL injection.
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:51.240]   I'm like, "Man, that's the first thing you want to try to combat when you put your site
[01:27:51.240 --> 01:27:52.240]   over."
[01:27:52.240 --> 01:27:57.560]   Why is there a database even connected to their public-facing website?
[01:27:57.560 --> 01:28:02.920]   I can think of a lot of things wrong with this picture.
[01:28:02.920 --> 01:28:04.480]   Again, we don't know how it.
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:06.920]   We have scant information.
[01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:12.680]   All right, my blood pressure is going to go through the roof.
[01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:13.680]   Let's take a quick break.
[01:28:13.680 --> 01:28:14.680]   I'm going to breathe.
[01:28:14.680 --> 01:28:17.200]   Leo Antprood is here from Tech Republic.
[01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:18.640]   He knows SQL.
[01:28:18.640 --> 01:28:19.640]   Watch out.
[01:28:19.640 --> 01:28:22.800]   He could be trouble.
[01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:27.760]   Also here from Code Breaker, great to have Ben Johnson and from PED30.
[01:28:27.760 --> 01:28:29.880]   Philip Elmer DeWitt, the dean.
[01:28:29.880 --> 01:28:31.280]   I don't know SQL.
[01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:32.280]   You don't know SQL?
[01:28:32.280 --> 01:28:33.280]   No.
[01:28:33.280 --> 01:28:35.280]   It's easy, peasy.
[01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:37.520]   I know MySQL.
[01:28:37.520 --> 01:28:40.440]   That's kind of like the same as a SQL query, right?
[01:28:40.440 --> 01:28:41.440]   Similar.
[01:28:41.440 --> 01:28:42.440]   Similar.
[01:28:42.440 --> 01:28:43.600]   Little Tommy Drop Tables.
[01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:45.200]   I remember that.
[01:28:45.200 --> 01:28:46.700]   Yeah.
[01:28:46.700 --> 01:28:48.640]   You've seen that XKCD comic, I'm sure.
[01:28:48.640 --> 01:28:49.640]   I have.
[01:28:49.640 --> 01:28:50.640]   Yeah.
[01:28:50.640 --> 01:28:57.120]   Why did you name your kid Little Tommy Drop Tables?
[01:28:57.120 --> 01:28:58.520]   Sanitize your inputs, kids.
[01:28:58.520 --> 01:28:59.760]   That's our message of the day.
[01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:05.240]   Our show today brought to you by FreshBooks, the ridiculously easy to use Cloud Accounting
[01:29:05.240 --> 01:29:06.240]   software.
[01:29:06.240 --> 01:29:12.240]   If you are a freelancer, if you are a small business, if you're an entrepreneur, you know
[01:29:12.240 --> 01:29:17.080]   that you've gotten business for one thing, because something you love, photography or
[01:29:17.080 --> 01:29:22.080]   plumbing or SQL queries, you didn't get into business because you love sending invoices.
[01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:24.160]   That's the worst part of business is billing.
[01:29:24.160 --> 01:29:25.880]   You don't like paying bills, right?
[01:29:25.880 --> 01:29:27.360]   Who likes sending bills?
[01:29:27.360 --> 01:29:28.360]   It's just as bad.
[01:29:28.360 --> 01:29:29.360]   It's paperwork.
[01:29:29.360 --> 01:29:30.360]   Let FreshBooks do it.
[01:29:30.360 --> 01:29:31.360]   I did.
[01:29:31.360 --> 01:29:34.160]   When I first found out about FreshBooks, it's been more than 10 years now.
[01:29:34.160 --> 01:29:39.320]   They had just started, and I was going to Canada once a month to do a TV show, and I
[01:29:39.320 --> 01:29:43.760]   had to invoice Rogers for my time and for my travel expenses.
[01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:45.080]   It was just a pain in the butt.
[01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:46.560]   You know, fire up Excel.
[01:29:46.560 --> 01:29:48.640]   You got to find all the receipts.
[01:29:48.640 --> 01:29:50.000]   It was just a pain in the butt.
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:53.920]   It was actually my co-host, Amber MacArthur, said, "Oh, there's this new company in Toronto.
[01:29:53.920 --> 01:29:54.920]   You're going to love them."
[01:29:54.920 --> 01:29:57.320]   FreshBooks, it made it really easy.
[01:29:57.320 --> 01:30:00.240]   All of a sudden, invoicing was a snap.
[01:30:00.240 --> 01:30:02.120]   I noticed I got paid faster.
[01:30:02.120 --> 01:30:05.160]   Of course, first thing you learn is if you don't send an invoice, you don't get paid
[01:30:05.160 --> 01:30:08.360]   at all, that's kind of fundamental.
[01:30:08.360 --> 01:30:10.440]   Sounds like that adds up.
[01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:12.160]   That does.
[01:30:12.160 --> 01:30:13.160]   Don't tell me, man.
[01:30:13.160 --> 01:30:15.160]   I went six months because I just hated it so much.
[01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:19.960]   I sent six months with invoices, and I got yelled at by the bookkeeper at Rogers.
[01:30:19.960 --> 01:30:21.440]   She said, "You can't do that.
[01:30:21.440 --> 01:30:24.720]   You're the next time you do that, we're not going to pay you.
[01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:28.320]   You need to bill us every month."
[01:30:28.320 --> 01:30:32.880]   It turns out if you use FreshBooks, you get paid on average 11 days faster.
[01:30:32.880 --> 01:30:34.640]   Your invoices look pro.
[01:30:34.640 --> 01:30:39.240]   They're easier for them too because there is a button on the email on the invoice that
[01:30:39.240 --> 01:30:40.240]   says, "Pay Leo."
[01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:43.120]   Well, in your case, it'll say your name.
[01:30:43.120 --> 01:30:45.360]   Pay this bill, and they make it easy for them.
[01:30:45.360 --> 01:30:47.560]   They can use all the online payment systems.
[01:30:47.560 --> 01:30:50.080]   You can set automatic payment reminders, automatic late fees.
[01:30:50.080 --> 01:30:51.440]   You can set up recurring invoices.
[01:30:51.440 --> 01:30:56.680]   You can even, if you're a customer agrees, set up automatic payments.
[01:30:56.680 --> 01:30:58.880]   The whole thing can be friction-free.
[01:30:58.880 --> 01:31:02.960]   Then it turns out that because they're doing the invoicing, by the way, expenses are really
[01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:03.960]   easy too.
[01:31:03.960 --> 01:31:04.960]   You just take a picture of the receipt.
[01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:05.960]   It goes right in the invoice.
[01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:08.400]   You can keep track of time and hours.
[01:31:08.400 --> 01:31:11.640]   The website or the app, they're great FreshBooks apps.
[01:31:11.640 --> 01:31:13.360]   We'll do that for you automatically.
[01:31:13.360 --> 01:31:15.880]   Again, put it right into the invoice.
[01:31:15.880 --> 01:31:20.400]   But what's great about this is in the process of collecting your expenses and your accounts
[01:31:20.400 --> 01:31:23.320]   receivable and all that, they've done your accounting.
[01:31:23.320 --> 01:31:28.400]   You can go to this new FreshBooks dashboard, we'll tell you everything about your business.
[01:31:28.400 --> 01:31:32.240]   How many freelancers know if they've made a profit so far this year?
[01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:35.680]   Usually, you don't know whether you made money until tax time.
[01:31:35.680 --> 01:31:39.880]   Well, now you'll know exactly where you stand at any moment.
[01:31:39.880 --> 01:31:41.520]   It's so simple.
[01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:42.520]   It's so slick.
[01:31:42.520 --> 01:31:43.520]   It's so easy to use.
[01:31:43.520 --> 01:31:46.280]   I want you to try it absolutely free for 30 days.
[01:31:46.280 --> 01:31:53.000]   You get the entire FreshBooks deal free at freshbooks.com/twit.
[01:31:53.000 --> 01:31:57.280]   You can see receipt attachments from your view invoices in the iOS app.
[01:31:57.280 --> 01:32:00.040]   They always are adding features, which I really like.
[01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:03.920]   It's an online website plus the app.
[01:32:03.920 --> 01:32:06.160]   They're constantly adding new features.
[01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:09.400]   Employees can now log in on the FreshBooks mobile app for iOS, which makes it easier
[01:32:09.400 --> 01:32:11.440]   for them to take care of business.
[01:32:11.440 --> 01:32:15.400]   If you have employees, you can build for time by client, by project.
[01:32:15.400 --> 01:32:19.080]   You can assign services to projects, have different rates for each service.
[01:32:19.080 --> 01:32:22.080]   Very flexible.
[01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:25.320]   FreshBooks was included in the Forbes Small Giants list for 2017.
[01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:27.080]   A huge honor.
[01:32:27.080 --> 01:32:29.200]   I want you to try it free for 30 days.
[01:32:29.200 --> 01:32:30.920]   FreshBooks.com/twit.
[01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:34.520]   All I ask is when you fill out that form and they say, "How did you hear about us?"
[01:32:34.520 --> 01:32:37.920]   You just say, "Hey, I heard about it on Twit."
[01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:41.840]   FreshBooks.com/twit.
[01:32:41.840 --> 01:32:43.240]   It was a lifesaver for me.
[01:32:43.240 --> 01:32:45.240]   It'll be a lifesaver for you.
[01:32:45.240 --> 01:32:48.240]   FreshBooks.com/twit.
[01:32:48.240 --> 01:32:53.480]   This we can tech on the air.
[01:32:53.480 --> 01:32:54.480]   Let's see.
[01:32:54.480 --> 01:32:55.480]   Sad news.
[01:32:55.480 --> 01:32:56.960]   I am a big HTC fan.
[01:32:56.960 --> 01:32:58.480]   Remember the HTC One?
[01:32:58.480 --> 01:33:01.960]   That was like the best with the front-facing speakers.
[01:33:01.960 --> 01:33:03.760]   Solid, boom sound.
[01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:06.200]   Boom sound, right.
[01:33:06.200 --> 01:33:11.200]   HTC has had its worst quarter, I think, in 13 years.
[01:33:11.200 --> 01:33:16.840]   Now the rumor is Google may be buying HTC's smartphone division.
[01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:18.200]   You mentioned the Vive ad.
[01:33:18.200 --> 01:33:24.640]   That's a great VR headset and I imagine they'll still be around, but the mobile division may
[01:33:24.640 --> 01:33:26.840]   be moving to Google, which would be interesting.
[01:33:26.840 --> 01:33:27.840]   Remember Google?
[01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:28.840]   I had assumed.
[01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:33.280]   I had assumed HTC would double down on the Vive because it was...
[01:33:33.280 --> 01:33:34.280]   That's their grossest.
[01:33:34.280 --> 01:33:35.280]   It was so great.
[01:33:35.280 --> 01:33:41.920]   Again, I get sick just at the drop of the hack because of my ears, but I did the Vive
[01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:44.960]   experience and it just blew me away.
[01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:50.200]   I didn't get any type of nausea or anything like that, but just the technology behind
[01:33:50.200 --> 01:33:55.320]   it and having those controllers and all that to interface with it, it was just great.
[01:33:55.320 --> 01:33:56.320]   I agree.
[01:33:56.320 --> 01:34:01.120]   And the partnership with Steam is really important too because then you can get all the Steam
[01:34:01.120 --> 01:34:02.280]   apps.
[01:34:02.280 --> 01:34:04.480]   The Vive is fantastic.
[01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:08.640]   I love it, but the smartphone business, they've really struggled and I have to say they
[01:34:08.640 --> 01:34:10.080]   might have deserved it.
[01:34:10.080 --> 01:34:15.280]   The last few, they had the one and they went downhill after that and the last few phones
[01:34:15.280 --> 01:34:17.600]   I've used of HTC is very unimpressive.
[01:34:17.600 --> 01:34:18.600]   Not great.
[01:34:18.600 --> 01:34:23.600]   The rumor is they are making the small Pixel 2.
[01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:28.480]   LG will make the big Pixel 2.
[01:34:28.480 --> 01:34:32.680]   That's not enough to save the company and maybe that would be why Google would be interested
[01:34:32.680 --> 01:34:33.680]   in buying them.
[01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:37.440]   They did remember they bought Motorola and that did not work out well.
[01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:42.680]   Yeah, I don't get, like forgive me, but I don't understand.
[01:34:42.680 --> 01:34:48.440]   I actually don't understand why the Google possibility here because didn't haven't we
[01:34:48.440 --> 01:34:49.440]   learned anything?
[01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:54.000]   Haven't we seen this before with Motorola?
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:35:00.960]   Yeah, they bought Motorola in 2012 for $12.5 billion, sold it to Lenovo three years later
[01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:03.240]   or two years later for $3 billion.
[01:35:03.240 --> 01:35:05.520]   But they kept the IP.
[01:35:05.520 --> 01:35:07.080]   They kept the intellectual property.
[01:35:07.080 --> 01:35:08.960]   There were a lot of patents.
[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:09.960]   There are thousands of patents.
[01:35:09.960 --> 01:35:10.960]   Oh, it says some of them.
[01:35:10.960 --> 01:35:11.960]   Had a bunch of patents.
[01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:12.960]   Okay, some of the values.
[01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:16.440]   But even still, what's the interest in HTC?
[01:35:16.440 --> 01:35:23.720]   Like how does this make sense in a way that they're getting a bunch of IP?
[01:35:23.720 --> 01:35:24.720]   Here's what's changed.
[01:35:24.720 --> 01:35:29.760]   Remember in 2012 Google was making the Nexus phones and they weren't making, as they do
[01:35:29.760 --> 01:35:33.960]   today, they were getting other companies to make them in random.
[01:35:33.960 --> 01:35:38.520]   Those were inexpensive phones that really looked like they were a developer platform.
[01:35:38.520 --> 01:35:41.720]   Like, this is the reference platform for Android.
[01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:44.160]   We don't expect anybody to really use it.
[01:35:44.160 --> 01:35:48.600]   But then the Pixel phones come along and it really looks like Google has ambitions to
[01:35:48.600 --> 01:35:54.600]   be a flagship phone manufacturer, but they're not making them still.
[01:35:54.600 --> 01:35:58.120]   So who made the original Pixel's?
[01:35:58.120 --> 01:35:59.120]   I forget.
[01:35:59.120 --> 01:36:01.320]   But it wasn't made by Google.
[01:36:01.320 --> 01:36:03.320]   It was made to Google's specifications.
[01:36:03.320 --> 01:36:04.320]   So it would make sense.
[01:36:04.320 --> 01:36:05.320]   Or the original Nexus.
[01:36:05.320 --> 01:36:07.120]   Well, the Nexus was made by a bunch of people.
[01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:08.120]   In fact, HTC.
[01:36:08.120 --> 01:36:09.120]   HTC had one.
[01:36:09.120 --> 01:36:10.120]   It made one of them.
[01:36:10.120 --> 01:36:12.520]   It made the first one, I think.
[01:36:12.520 --> 01:36:13.560]   Samsung made some.
[01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:16.320]   The Nexus one, I think, was a Samsung phone.
[01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:19.080]   But I can't remember who made these Pixel's.
[01:36:19.080 --> 01:36:24.680]   But anyway, it would make sense for Google if they say, "Well, we're going to now make
[01:36:24.680 --> 01:36:28.480]   a business out of Android devices."
[01:36:28.480 --> 01:36:34.040]   And they could reasonably do so, because as you pointed out, these are Huawei.
[01:36:34.040 --> 01:36:35.040]   That's the name.
[01:36:35.040 --> 01:36:36.040]   Huawei.
[01:36:36.040 --> 01:36:38.040]   Thank you.
[01:36:38.040 --> 01:36:39.840]   Thank you.
[01:36:39.840 --> 01:36:41.280]   Birkin the chatroom.
[01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:44.520]   And hey, congratulations for going to the chatroom.
[01:36:44.520 --> 01:36:48.520]   Most people are not brave enough to go into the chatroom.
[01:36:48.520 --> 01:36:50.400]   This show, you're a brave fellow.
[01:36:50.400 --> 01:36:52.640]   They haven't said anything bad about you.
[01:36:52.640 --> 01:36:53.640]   Or ignorant.
[01:36:53.640 --> 01:36:54.640]   Or ignorant.
[01:36:54.640 --> 01:36:55.880]   One of the other.
[01:36:55.880 --> 01:36:59.040]   So no, the chatroom is fine.
[01:36:59.040 --> 01:37:00.440]   They're not going to bite you.
[01:37:00.440 --> 01:37:02.000]   I could kind of see if this is a...
[01:37:02.000 --> 01:37:04.000]   Okay, now it's a business for Google.
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:05.240]   Maybe we should own a manufacturer.
[01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:07.440]   I don't know.
[01:37:07.440 --> 01:37:14.800]   I have a story about HTC.
[01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:19.640]   It goes back to how I first started getting into content creation.
[01:37:19.640 --> 01:37:23.320]   Your friend, Gina Smith, gave me my first opportunity.
[01:37:23.320 --> 01:37:24.320]   No kidding.
[01:37:24.320 --> 01:37:25.320]   I didn't know that.
[01:37:25.320 --> 01:37:28.840]   Gina Smith and Dr. Purnell was part of the world.
[01:37:28.840 --> 01:37:30.840]   I was going to say that was a new domain, right?
[01:37:30.840 --> 01:37:32.040]   And Jerry wrote for a new domain.
[01:37:32.040 --> 01:37:33.040]   I didn't.
[01:37:33.040 --> 01:37:34.040]   So you worked with Jerry.
[01:37:34.040 --> 01:37:35.040]   Yes, sir.
[01:37:35.040 --> 01:37:36.040]   Yeah.
[01:37:36.040 --> 01:37:42.600]   And at the time, there was a time where HTC was reaching out to Gina and all of us for
[01:37:42.600 --> 01:37:48.720]   content creation for a blog that they were trying to market towards millennials.
[01:37:48.720 --> 01:37:55.160]   And right before we had that relationship put together, I had a piece published.
[01:37:55.160 --> 01:38:01.560]   Talking about HTC sort of losing its way with the smartphone.
[01:38:01.560 --> 01:38:02.560]   So it was a little awkward.
[01:38:02.560 --> 01:38:03.560]   Nice one, eh?
[01:38:03.560 --> 01:38:04.560]   Good timing.
[01:38:04.560 --> 01:38:07.280]   A little awkward in that meeting.
[01:38:07.280 --> 01:38:10.600]   But at the same time, I was right.
[01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:16.760]   They were pretty candid about it and spoke with me as far as what my opinions were.
[01:38:16.760 --> 01:38:22.280]   They made great hardware for that time, but it just wasn't elevating or incrementing as
[01:38:22.280 --> 01:38:23.760]   fast as everybody else was saying.
[01:38:23.760 --> 01:38:25.200]   You were warning them rightly.
[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:31.520]   So, and I bet you this is right around the M1 came out and the Zoe's.
[01:38:31.520 --> 01:38:36.400]   This was right after the Zoe's and that little recammer thing.
[01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:37.400]   Yeah.
[01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:38.400]   Oh, I had a read.
[01:38:38.400 --> 01:38:39.400]   I love that read.
[01:38:39.400 --> 01:38:40.400]   The read was fine.
[01:38:40.400 --> 01:38:41.400]   It streamed right to YouTube.
[01:38:41.400 --> 01:38:42.400]   The read was fine.
[01:38:42.400 --> 01:38:46.280]   It's been straight downhill ever since.
[01:38:46.280 --> 01:38:47.280]   So you were right.
[01:38:47.280 --> 01:38:49.760]   And I guess they appreciated your honesty.
[01:38:49.760 --> 01:38:50.760]   Yeah.
[01:38:50.760 --> 01:38:51.760]   Yeah.
[01:38:51.760 --> 01:38:59.160]   Well, it makes me sad because I really feel like HTC, they had a design language.
[01:38:59.160 --> 01:39:00.400]   They did make quality stuff.
[01:39:00.400 --> 01:39:03.040]   They just lost their way in some strange way.
[01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:07.160]   You know, I give them credit for trying things just to see what happens.
[01:39:07.160 --> 01:39:13.120]   You know, with this latest phone, the squeeze technology, you know, to activate the camera
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:15.760]   and things like that, that's something different.
[01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:21.800]   And supposedly that's going to be part of the new pixel, pixel two, Google is going to
[01:39:21.800 --> 01:39:26.480]   use the squeeze to launch the Google Assistant, which might work.
[01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:27.480]   That would be a nightmare.
[01:39:27.480 --> 01:39:28.480]   That would be a nightmare for me.
[01:39:28.480 --> 01:39:32.600]   I already launched Google Assistant by mistake all the time.
[01:39:32.600 --> 01:39:36.360]   Are you one of those tense people that's always like, you need to get a little squeeze
[01:39:36.360 --> 01:39:37.360]   ball?
[01:39:37.360 --> 01:39:38.360]   Yeah.
[01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:45.400]   No, I mean, I don't know why, but I just, I like, I already like inadvertently get
[01:39:45.400 --> 01:39:46.880]   Google Assistant going.
[01:39:46.880 --> 01:39:48.520]   I don't even know how it happens.
[01:39:48.520 --> 01:39:50.280]   I'm not saying, okay, Google at all.
[01:39:50.280 --> 01:39:53.480]   I try to echo Google's Siri.
[01:39:53.480 --> 01:39:54.920]   They all get triggered in my house.
[01:39:54.920 --> 01:39:57.560]   I can't watch TV without what?
[01:39:57.560 --> 01:39:58.560]   Huh?
[01:39:58.560 --> 01:39:59.560]   All the time.
[01:39:59.560 --> 01:40:01.520]   All your books do that as I'm driving.
[01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:02.520]   Yeah.
[01:40:02.520 --> 01:40:05.160]   It's just the way it is.
[01:40:05.160 --> 01:40:06.160]   Get ready.
[01:40:06.160 --> 01:40:07.160]   That's life in the future.
[01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:10.240]   In the future, everything answers everything.
[01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:15.200]   RF guy in the chat room is mentioning that HTC told him they didn't get the support from
[01:40:15.200 --> 01:40:22.240]   the chip companies, probably Qualcomm, maybe Samsung.
[01:40:22.240 --> 01:40:27.200]   So they weren't able to get the chips that the big guys who could negotiate, and that
[01:40:27.200 --> 01:40:29.040]   happens, right?
[01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:31.680]   It's kind of like speaking of chips poker.
[01:40:31.680 --> 01:40:37.400]   When you are the chip leader in poker, you have a huge advantage just because you're big.
[01:40:37.400 --> 01:40:41.880]   When you're selling 80 million phones, you have a huge advantage.
[01:40:41.880 --> 01:40:45.880]   And it's a vicious circle.
[01:40:45.880 --> 01:40:48.800]   The rich get richer and the little companies fade away.
[01:40:48.800 --> 01:40:51.280]   I think HTC is just what's happening to them.
[01:40:51.280 --> 01:40:59.640]   Apple famously buys the capacity of something that they need that's a pressure point.
[01:40:59.640 --> 01:41:03.440]   They'll buy up all the capacity and really squeeze everybody else.
[01:41:03.440 --> 01:41:10.880]   I've got to say, I feel bad for the Android phone makers because they all use the same
[01:41:10.880 --> 01:41:12.800]   operating system.
[01:41:12.800 --> 01:41:17.680]   They end up competing on price, which is a race to the bottom.
[01:41:17.680 --> 01:41:23.680]   There's a reason that Apple has got what's 16% of the global market, but it takes home
[01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:28.960]   85%, 90% of the profit in cell phones.
[01:41:28.960 --> 01:41:30.560]   They're all struggling.
[01:41:30.560 --> 01:41:37.640]   And I'm not surprised that Motorola gets sold and they end up with Google that's got
[01:41:37.640 --> 01:41:40.400]   the money to keep them alive.
[01:41:40.400 --> 01:41:47.400]   There's going to be Apple, Samsung, Huawei's still huge because they have the China market.
[01:41:47.400 --> 01:41:54.240]   The Chinese manufacturers, because they have a huge market to play in, and there's a lot
[01:41:54.240 --> 01:41:59.200]   of cost advantages to working in that.
[01:41:59.200 --> 01:42:06.560]   Where all the suppliers are all in the same place, they're competing very well with Samsung
[01:42:06.560 --> 01:42:07.560]   and Apple.
[01:42:07.560 --> 01:42:12.840]   And Samsung and China, and that's enough to make a living.
[01:42:12.840 --> 01:42:13.840]   That's good market.
[01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:14.840]   Yeah.
[01:42:14.840 --> 01:42:19.080]   Well, they get a market of a billion consumers.
[01:42:19.080 --> 01:42:20.080]   That's all it takes.
[01:42:20.080 --> 01:42:22.080]   Sell a few folks.
[01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:26.880]   They haven't been as good as bringing it out.
[01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:29.040]   They're not selling this well outside.
[01:42:29.040 --> 01:42:31.000]   Outside, no.
[01:42:31.000 --> 01:42:34.040]   It's bad for consumers though because it's a consolidate.
[01:42:34.040 --> 01:42:35.040]   It's inevitable.
[01:42:35.040 --> 01:42:36.880]   It's capitalism, right?
[01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:39.680]   You get consolidation and a few big companies end up dominating.
[01:42:39.680 --> 01:42:43.520]   But we just don't get the innovation and the choice that we deserve.
[01:42:43.520 --> 01:42:47.400]   And at some point, nobody has headphone jacks anymore.
[01:42:47.400 --> 01:42:51.200]   That's the eventuality.
[01:42:51.200 --> 01:42:52.200]   Right?
[01:42:52.200 --> 01:42:53.200]   That's what happens.
[01:42:53.200 --> 01:42:54.760]   It's devolution.
[01:42:54.760 --> 01:42:55.760]   Yeah.
[01:42:55.760 --> 01:42:58.640]   And it's weird too.
[01:42:58.640 --> 01:43:03.320]   You know, the headphone jack thing, I think is interesting to me because the effort there
[01:43:03.320 --> 01:43:06.800]   is to make it thinner, right?
[01:43:06.800 --> 01:43:11.000]   And I just, I don't know.
[01:43:11.000 --> 01:43:15.520]   Does the phone really need to get that much thinner that we lose the headphone jack?
[01:43:15.520 --> 01:43:16.760]   Or battery life.
[01:43:16.760 --> 01:43:18.840]   That's another thing that's for sacrificing, right?
[01:43:18.840 --> 01:43:19.840]   Right.
[01:43:19.840 --> 01:43:24.280]   For someone with really large hands, I need my phone to be substantial.
[01:43:24.280 --> 01:43:25.280]   Yeah.
[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:29.600]   The whole trend of going smaller and thinner just bugged me at one point in time.
[01:43:29.600 --> 01:43:34.920]   And I'm glad that we have these, you know, five and a half, five point seven inch devices
[01:43:34.920 --> 01:43:38.440]   nowadays versus the older ones, you know?
[01:43:38.440 --> 01:43:43.960]   The most boring, most important innovation in smartphones, I think that we're still waiting
[01:43:43.960 --> 01:43:47.320]   for is a legitimate battery life.
[01:43:47.320 --> 01:43:53.600]   Like that, you know, if you give me a, I will pay Apple prices.
[01:43:53.600 --> 01:43:59.960]   I will pay for two iPhones if you tell me my battery will last a week and charge in 10
[01:43:59.960 --> 01:44:00.960]   minutes.
[01:44:00.960 --> 01:44:01.960]   Three more.
[01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:02.960]   You know what I mean?
[01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:03.960]   Let's do it.
[01:44:03.960 --> 01:44:07.960]   There's no technology exists that will do that.
[01:44:07.960 --> 01:44:08.960]   Dream on.
[01:44:08.960 --> 01:44:09.960]   You can't even get it.
[01:44:09.960 --> 01:44:10.960]   I can make a clear phone.
[01:44:10.960 --> 01:44:11.960]   I can make a clear phone.
[01:44:11.960 --> 01:44:12.960]   Yeah.
[01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:13.960]   Clear.
[01:44:13.960 --> 01:44:14.960]   If they can make it clear, make it last a week.
[01:44:14.960 --> 01:44:16.960]   So I'm going to get Elon Musk on the line.
[01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:20.720]   Let's get this and it'll be, it'll have a little nuclear reactor in it or something
[01:44:20.720 --> 01:44:22.120]   like that.
[01:44:22.120 --> 01:44:31.280]   So ever since November, Facebook's been denying that Russians bought political ads on Facebook.
[01:44:31.280 --> 01:44:38.840]   On Wednesday, they admitted it more than $100,000 worth of ads on hot button social issues,
[01:44:38.840 --> 01:44:43.400]   targeting voters.
[01:44:43.400 --> 01:44:49.160]   Many of the ads didn't refer to political candidates, but the purchases we're starting
[01:44:49.160 --> 01:44:53.640]   to learn were aimed at people who were Clinton voters.
[01:44:53.640 --> 01:45:00.720]   Facebook officials says that these ads were purchased by a multitude of fake accounts created
[01:45:00.720 --> 01:45:07.760]   by the Internet Research Agency, which is a well-known kind of troll factory out of Russia.
[01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:09.600]   I almost said the Soviet Union.
[01:45:09.600 --> 01:45:11.080]   It kind of feels like it doesn't.
[01:45:11.080 --> 01:45:16.960]   It's a far part of their very broad disinformation efforts.
[01:45:16.960 --> 01:45:19.240]   It does really raise the issue.
[01:45:19.240 --> 01:45:22.200]   You know, Facebook after the election said, "Oh, wait a minute.
[01:45:22.200 --> 01:45:24.000]   Mark's like, why didn't I have anything to do with that?"
[01:45:24.000 --> 01:45:28.680]   Mark said, "No, you know, but I think we're learning more and more that Facebook wields
[01:45:28.680 --> 01:45:35.520]   immense power because of its ad platform, because of its vast usership in the United
[01:45:35.520 --> 01:45:37.760]   States and around the world."
[01:45:37.760 --> 01:45:40.080]   And this is concerning.
[01:45:40.080 --> 01:45:43.840]   Now, we talked about this on Wednesday on this week in Google.
[01:45:43.840 --> 01:45:47.240]   We thought at the time that it wasn't illegal, but I do believe now having looked into it
[01:45:47.240 --> 01:45:53.080]   that it is illegal for a foreign government to try to influence elections by buying ads.
[01:45:53.080 --> 01:45:54.400]   That's not legal.
[01:45:54.400 --> 01:45:58.880]   So Facebook did violate federal law by selling those ads.
[01:45:58.880 --> 01:46:01.720]   They probably didn't know.
[01:46:01.720 --> 01:46:07.560]   They say Facebook is cooperating now with members of Congress, staff members briefed
[01:46:07.560 --> 01:46:11.600]   Senate and House Intelligence Committees on Wednesday.
[01:46:11.600 --> 01:46:15.440]   Facebook's also cooperating with Robert Mueller, the special counsel.
[01:46:15.440 --> 01:46:18.200]   They wrote, "We have shared our findings with U.S. authorities investigating these
[01:46:18.200 --> 01:46:19.200]   issues.
[01:46:19.200 --> 01:46:21.240]   We'll continue to work with them as necessary."
[01:46:21.240 --> 01:46:23.640]   What is Facebook's responsibility?
[01:46:23.640 --> 01:46:25.960]   And did they know all along that they…
[01:46:25.960 --> 01:46:31.160]   Why didn't they only now find out that these ads were sold to Russia and it's…
[01:46:31.160 --> 01:46:36.200]   I wonder when you do Facebook ads, what's the process?
[01:46:36.200 --> 01:46:40.400]   You open up your account or whatever and you sign in to say, "I want to purchase some
[01:46:40.400 --> 01:46:41.400]   ads."
[01:46:41.400 --> 01:46:47.440]   What are the questions that are being asked from the Facebook form to give you access
[01:46:47.440 --> 01:46:49.320]   to have ad placement on there?
[01:46:49.320 --> 01:46:51.560]   You know, Dale Koko, I believe, is in the chat.
[01:46:51.560 --> 01:46:58.160]   He said, "They shouldn't have any anyone doing ads for political reasons, but does Facebook
[01:46:58.160 --> 01:46:59.880]   even know when someone signs up?"
[01:46:59.880 --> 01:47:02.680]   I mean, I could just go in there and say, "I want to do ant-prood ads," and they probably
[01:47:02.680 --> 01:47:05.320]   don't even care what the ads are.
[01:47:05.320 --> 01:47:06.880]   It just says ant-prood.
[01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:07.880]   I don't know.
[01:47:07.880 --> 01:47:08.880]   Anybody ever done this?
[01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:10.440]   No, there is a…
[01:47:10.440 --> 01:47:12.280]   They ask you how much you want to spend.
[01:47:12.280 --> 01:47:16.320]   You submit the ad and then they have to approve it.
[01:47:16.320 --> 01:47:21.440]   I don't know what they're criterion on, but there is a step where some algorithm was
[01:47:21.440 --> 01:47:23.320]   where some human approves the ad.
[01:47:23.320 --> 01:47:25.200]   Because you can't just put anything on it.
[01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:26.200]   I think it's humans.
[01:47:26.200 --> 01:47:27.960]   I think it's humans.
[01:47:27.960 --> 01:47:31.560]   But I will also say that I've done this and it does not take long to get it off.
[01:47:31.560 --> 01:47:33.560]   So they're not looking real fast.
[01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:34.560]   It's real fast.
[01:47:34.560 --> 01:47:35.560]   Yeah.
[01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:36.560]   What's in…
[01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:37.560]   What's in…
[01:47:37.560 --> 01:47:45.040]   Really, for someone who spends more time watching the White House circle the drain than following
[01:47:45.040 --> 01:47:50.440]   Apple these days, what's interesting about the Facebook thing is that we've known that
[01:47:50.440 --> 01:47:57.480]   the Russians hacked Podesta's emails and got all this anti-Hillary stuff.
[01:47:57.480 --> 01:48:04.800]   What we don't know is how they knew to direct it to the right precincts and to weaponize
[01:48:04.800 --> 01:48:07.120]   it is the jargon they use.
[01:48:07.120 --> 01:48:17.520]   And one of the theories is, and what Mueller is trying to find out, is did the Trump campaign
[01:48:17.520 --> 01:48:23.400]   operation, which had great research, feed it to the Russians and help them weaponize
[01:48:23.400 --> 01:48:24.560]   the thing that they did.
[01:48:24.560 --> 01:48:26.640]   They knew what can't look precincts.
[01:48:26.640 --> 01:48:27.640]   They needed to swear.
[01:48:27.640 --> 01:48:28.640]   Yeah.
[01:48:28.640 --> 01:48:29.640]   Right.
[01:48:29.640 --> 01:48:30.640]   Now, who knows better?
[01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:39.240]   The Facebook thing is not dispositive because it's pretty easy for someone who doesn't
[01:48:39.240 --> 01:48:44.720]   know much about US politics to guess at where to send stuff.
[01:48:44.720 --> 01:48:48.680]   You know which states are…
[01:48:48.680 --> 01:48:51.240]   I don't know.
[01:48:51.240 --> 01:48:58.240]   It's fairly easy to target with Facebook's tools and it may not require the sophistication
[01:48:58.240 --> 01:49:01.560]   of a Steve Bannon to know exactly where to send those things.
[01:49:01.560 --> 01:49:02.560]   We don't know yet.
[01:49:02.560 --> 01:49:07.760]   New York Times has an interesting article about this kind of Russian troll farm.
[01:49:07.760 --> 01:49:14.120]   And an example, Melvin Redick of Harrisburg PA, a friendly looking American with a backward
[01:49:14.120 --> 01:49:19.200]   baseball cap and a young daughter, you can see it in his profile picture, posted, "These
[01:49:19.200 --> 01:49:24.000]   guys show hidden truth about Hillary Clinton, George Soros and other leaders of the US and
[01:49:24.000 --> 01:49:28.440]   a link to at dcleeks.com."
[01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:36.360]   But there is no Melvin Redick and he is a made up character by Russian hackers.
[01:49:36.360 --> 01:49:39.080]   And the problem is, and I can understand, Facebook…
[01:49:39.080 --> 01:49:43.480]   Look, people have posed as me on Facebook and it took me going to Facebook saying that's
[01:49:43.480 --> 01:49:47.760]   not me to get it down.
[01:49:47.760 --> 01:49:49.360]   They've got a billion and a half users.
[01:49:49.360 --> 01:49:50.360]   This is a very difficult…
[01:49:50.360 --> 01:49:53.920]   It's hard to filter a billion records, you know.
[01:49:53.920 --> 01:49:54.920]   Yeah.
[01:49:54.920 --> 01:49:58.160]   Facebook is reactive when it comes to this kind of thing.
[01:49:58.160 --> 01:50:05.000]   And I think that's, to me, that's been over time covering this stuff, whether it's
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:06.600]   people impersonating other people.
[01:50:06.600 --> 01:50:13.640]   They have a big problem with this in India, for instance, of folks impersonating other
[01:50:13.640 --> 01:50:18.440]   people to get Facebook accounts and then say bad things about them.
[01:50:18.440 --> 01:50:20.000]   This is like a…
[01:50:20.000 --> 01:50:22.600]   I've talked to some people who are dealing with this.
[01:50:22.600 --> 01:50:30.000]   I think Facebook at a basic level is reactive, whether that's…
[01:50:30.000 --> 01:50:33.640]   Whatever it is that violates their term and conditions, whether it's violent video.
[01:50:33.640 --> 01:50:34.640]   What are you going to do, right?
[01:50:34.640 --> 01:50:35.640]   I think that's necessary.
[01:50:35.640 --> 01:50:39.960]   I don't know how they can be proactive.
[01:50:39.960 --> 01:50:47.240]   I guess I don't either, but I think that's what we're seeing to a certain degree is because
[01:50:47.240 --> 01:50:54.480]   of that, is because Facebook can't be proactive about it, maybe.
[01:50:54.480 --> 01:50:59.400]   And that's why we see this tough after the fact.
[01:50:59.400 --> 01:51:05.560]   And at this point in the New York Times story about the company said it also found another
[01:51:05.560 --> 01:51:15.520]   2,200 ads that were bought in America and were more vaguely related to politics than
[01:51:15.520 --> 01:51:18.080]   the more direct advertising stuff.
[01:51:18.080 --> 01:51:24.640]   And they hadn't really figured out yet whether or not those were part of this larger effort.
[01:51:24.640 --> 01:51:31.000]   I think they're trying to figure it out and maybe that's normal, but that's part of
[01:51:31.000 --> 01:51:32.600]   what we're seeing.
[01:51:32.600 --> 01:51:34.560]   Yeah, they do.
[01:51:34.560 --> 01:51:36.200]   Let's take a break.
[01:51:36.200 --> 01:51:38.480]   One more segment to go.
[01:51:38.480 --> 01:51:43.640]   Kind of the stories that filtered to the bottom of the rundown this week.
[01:51:43.640 --> 01:51:46.560]   Aunt Pruitt is here from Tech Republic.
[01:51:46.560 --> 01:51:51.000]   From Code Breaker, the podcast is at codebreaker.com/benjonson.
[01:51:51.000 --> 01:51:52.000]   Codebreaker.coads.
[01:51:52.000 --> 01:51:53.000]   That is the show.
[01:51:53.000 --> 01:51:58.960]   Yeah, and I leaked, I should have said before, I leaked to you.
[01:51:58.960 --> 01:51:59.880]   We were talking about leaks.
[01:51:59.880 --> 01:52:04.800]   I leaked to you what I'm doing next when I saw you.
[01:52:04.800 --> 01:52:07.480]   You've gotten the leak.
[01:52:07.480 --> 01:52:13.120]   It's really safe to leak to me because I have a brain like a sieve.
[01:52:13.120 --> 01:52:18.240]   Although I make a point of never signing NDAs in bar goes, I don't agree not to reveal
[01:52:18.240 --> 01:52:22.960]   information because not only do I forget stuff, but I forget that I agreed not to say stuff.
[01:52:22.960 --> 01:52:26.000]   I'm talking all the time.
[01:52:26.000 --> 01:52:27.760]   You may have no promises to me.
[01:52:27.760 --> 01:52:32.480]   I make no promises, but you're in luck because I remember nothing.
[01:52:32.480 --> 01:52:35.600]   I was drinking podcasters' punch at the time.
[01:52:35.600 --> 01:52:36.600]   Was I not?
[01:52:36.600 --> 01:52:37.600]   I was too.
[01:52:37.600 --> 01:52:39.080]   I think we were both.
[01:52:39.080 --> 01:52:44.880]   The hotel made us a special punch for podcasters.
[01:52:44.880 --> 01:52:52.000]   In the chat room, Old Army says two more feet of water and Ermer will be in the house
[01:52:52.000 --> 01:52:54.000]   and he'll have to leave the program for me.
[01:52:54.000 --> 01:52:55.000]   Old Army, please.
[01:52:55.000 --> 01:52:57.040]   Old Army, I am so sorry.
[01:52:57.040 --> 01:52:59.880]   And by the way, I haven't said anything about Ermer.
[01:52:59.880 --> 01:53:03.920]   You know, got right on the heels of Harvey in Texas.
[01:53:03.920 --> 01:53:08.760]   Now this in Florida, and I know we have a great many listeners in both areas.
[01:53:08.760 --> 01:53:12.440]   We have a great many listeners in the Caribbean Islands, in the Virgin Islands, the British
[01:53:12.440 --> 01:53:14.920]   Virgin Islands.
[01:53:14.920 --> 01:53:17.160]   The only place we don't have listeners is Cuba.
[01:53:17.160 --> 01:53:22.600]   But everywhere else, please, I hope you're safe and our thoughts and prayers are with
[01:53:22.600 --> 01:53:23.600]   you.
[01:53:23.600 --> 01:53:26.320]   And Old Army, stay safe.
[01:53:26.320 --> 01:53:28.800]   I hope you have a ladder up to the roof.
[01:53:28.800 --> 01:53:29.800]   Yikes.
[01:53:29.800 --> 01:53:30.800]   That's terrible.
[01:53:30.800 --> 01:53:31.800]   Go on the roof.
[01:53:31.800 --> 01:53:33.360]   It's not, not, not, not, not, not.
[01:53:33.360 --> 01:53:34.680]   Yeah, on the roof.
[01:53:34.680 --> 01:53:35.680]   Yeah.
[01:53:35.680 --> 01:53:38.600]   Codebreaker.codes, if you want.
[01:53:38.600 --> 01:53:39.600]   Yes, sir.
[01:53:39.600 --> 01:53:46.080]   Listen to pen, pen, pens, great podcast, or could be pens, great podcast.
[01:53:46.080 --> 01:53:48.480]   I don't know, it could be any, and it's great podcast.
[01:53:48.480 --> 01:53:51.520]   What do you talk about on here?
[01:53:51.520 --> 01:53:53.440]   We, you know, we talk about a lot of different stuff.
[01:53:53.440 --> 01:53:59.760]   I pitch it as, I pitch it as the Twilight Zone meets radio journalism.
[01:53:59.760 --> 01:54:00.760]   Love it.
[01:54:00.760 --> 01:54:06.760]   So, you know, if you've seen Black Mirror, if you've seen Mr. Roblox, this is the kind
[01:54:06.760 --> 01:54:12.200]   of stuff we take a kind of a dark edge to look at technology.
[01:54:12.200 --> 01:54:16.000]   At least the first season, we asked the fundamental question about different kinds of technology
[01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:18.400]   the question was, is it evil?
[01:54:18.400 --> 01:54:24.320]   We covered everything from email killing our productivity to internet porn to actually
[01:54:24.320 --> 01:54:28.920]   data, data selling, which we've been talking about today.
[01:54:28.920 --> 01:54:32.400]   And the second season, the question was, can it save us?
[01:54:32.400 --> 01:54:40.640]   And we talk about everything from sort of climate change based technology or technology
[01:54:40.640 --> 01:54:48.000]   rooted in solving climate change issues to virtual reality, augmented reality, and technology
[01:54:48.000 --> 01:54:52.800]   that are helping refugees in the refugee crisis in Syria, things like that.
[01:54:52.800 --> 01:54:53.800]   That's right.
[01:54:53.800 --> 01:54:58.280]   And you do this really cool thing, which is you can listen to the next week's podcast
[01:54:58.280 --> 01:55:00.200]   if you crack the code.
[01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:06.040]   Yeah, we make it bingeable, like a Netflix show when we release each season by hiding
[01:55:06.040 --> 01:55:08.280]   a secret code in every episode.
[01:55:08.280 --> 01:55:09.280]   So clever.
[01:55:09.280 --> 01:55:10.440]   So, yeah, it's fun.
[01:55:10.440 --> 01:55:11.440]   I love that idea.
[01:55:11.440 --> 01:55:12.440]   That's really good.
[01:55:12.440 --> 01:55:13.440]   Yeah, it's good.
[01:55:13.440 --> 01:55:14.440]   Yeah.
[01:55:14.440 --> 01:55:15.440]   Codebreaker.cos.
[01:55:15.440 --> 01:55:16.440]   Is that right?
[01:55:16.440 --> 01:55:17.440]   Yes, sir.
[01:55:17.440 --> 01:55:18.440]   CODES.
[01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:21.680]   I even know there was a codes DLN, a TOT TD.
[01:55:21.680 --> 01:55:23.480]   Yeah, we got one.
[01:55:23.480 --> 01:55:24.480]   Wow.
[01:55:24.480 --> 01:55:25.480]   Codes.
[01:55:25.480 --> 01:55:26.480]   I like it.
[01:55:26.480 --> 01:55:33.400]   Also, of course, the legendary Philip Elmer DeWitt, PED30.com, who will be skying to Cupertino
[01:55:33.400 --> 01:55:34.960]   any minute now.
[01:55:34.960 --> 01:55:37.000]   Get ready for the Apple event.
[01:55:37.000 --> 01:55:39.440]   Our show today brought to you by Tracker, the tracker.
[01:55:39.440 --> 01:55:41.840]   I have a tracker story.
[01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:48.000]   We went to a concert on Friday night, and I thought I lost my keys at the bar next door.
[01:55:48.000 --> 01:55:49.000]   I couldn't...
[01:55:49.000 --> 01:55:50.000]   I was patting my pockets.
[01:55:50.000 --> 01:55:51.000]   I can't find my keys.
[01:55:51.000 --> 01:55:52.000]   So I went to the bar next door.
[01:55:52.000 --> 01:55:53.560]   Do you find any keys?
[01:55:53.560 --> 01:55:55.320]   No, the good news is my keys have it.
[01:55:55.320 --> 01:55:57.320]   A tracker pixel attached.
[01:55:57.320 --> 01:56:00.760]   And I was looking on the tracker, and I said, "Well, it's around here somewhere."
[01:56:00.760 --> 01:56:05.600]   And then I remembered, "Oh, yeah, I could tap the button on my phone, and the alarm
[01:56:05.600 --> 01:56:07.160]   on the tracker will go off."
[01:56:07.160 --> 01:56:08.400]   I pressed the button.
[01:56:08.400 --> 01:56:09.400]   I'm in the bar.
[01:56:09.400 --> 01:56:10.600]   I'm thinking, "Oh, they're here somewhere."
[01:56:10.600 --> 01:56:15.520]   And then I realized, "Oh, they're in the hidden pocket in my Scotty vest shirt."
[01:56:15.520 --> 01:56:17.520]   Never mind.
[01:56:17.520 --> 01:56:21.600]   But even if you lose your keys in your shirt, you can find them again with a tracker.
[01:56:21.600 --> 01:56:26.240]   It's a coin-sized tracking device, pairs with your phone, and keeps you from losing your
[01:56:26.240 --> 01:56:28.920]   most valued possessions.
[01:56:28.920 --> 01:56:31.480]   You check the catch, check the kitchen, you check the pockets.
[01:56:31.480 --> 01:56:36.120]   On average, all of us spend as much as 50.
[01:56:36.120 --> 01:56:37.120]   What is it?
[01:56:37.120 --> 01:56:40.600]   It's a day, according to Newsweek, searching for stuff we know we own.
[01:56:40.600 --> 01:56:41.600]   We know we have.
[01:56:41.600 --> 01:56:42.960]   We just can't find it.
[01:56:42.960 --> 01:56:44.760]   You're looking in the fridge.
[01:56:44.760 --> 01:56:47.080]   You ever look in the fridge for your glasses and stuff?
[01:56:47.080 --> 01:56:50.720]   Yeah, because I know I must have absent mindly.
[01:56:50.720 --> 01:56:52.280]   You look in the peanut butter chart.
[01:56:52.280 --> 01:56:53.600]   Well, you don't have to look anywhere.
[01:56:53.600 --> 01:56:55.120]   You can use the tracker.
[01:56:55.120 --> 01:56:59.920]   Eight years ago, Tracker changed everything with their first tracking device, and they've
[01:56:59.920 --> 01:57:00.920]   done it again.
[01:57:00.920 --> 01:57:02.720]   The new tracker pixel is out.
[01:57:02.720 --> 01:57:04.200]   That's what I have on my keys.
[01:57:04.200 --> 01:57:09.040]   It has a LED all around it that will light up, makes it easy to find stuff that's fallen
[01:57:09.040 --> 01:57:10.680]   under the bed or whatever.
[01:57:10.680 --> 01:57:13.360]   It's the lightest Bluetooth tracking device in the market.
[01:57:13.360 --> 01:57:16.240]   But even though it's light, it still has a replaceable battery.
[01:57:16.240 --> 01:57:22.160]   I love them for that because unlike other trackers, when the tracker battery dies after
[01:57:22.160 --> 01:57:26.440]   a year, you can replace it, not throw it away.
[01:57:26.440 --> 01:57:31.800]   I put trackers on everything, on my keys, on my briefcase, in my car, my luggage, on
[01:57:31.800 --> 01:57:33.320]   my bike.
[01:57:33.320 --> 01:57:34.320]   I don't want to lose anything.
[01:57:34.320 --> 01:57:37.120]   You can pair up to 10 trackers to your smartphone.
[01:57:37.120 --> 01:57:39.680]   You can share with other people's smartphones.
[01:57:39.680 --> 01:57:43.680]   You can have family find things time.
[01:57:43.680 --> 01:57:45.840]   You get a 90 decibel alert.
[01:57:45.840 --> 01:57:49.360]   That's what I got that helped me find my tracker.
[01:57:49.360 --> 01:57:53.880]   If you lose your phone, you press the button on the tracker and your phone rings, even
[01:57:53.880 --> 01:57:56.080]   if it's silenced.
[01:57:56.080 --> 01:58:01.000]   You can even locate your item if it smiles away because Tracker has the best crowd locate
[01:58:01.000 --> 01:58:03.040]   network in the world.
[01:58:03.040 --> 01:58:06.040]   With more than 5 million trackers out there.
[01:58:06.040 --> 01:58:10.280]   If you want to play with it, if you've got a tracker, turn on the notifications.
[01:58:10.280 --> 01:58:13.720]   Anytime somebody walks by that's running the software, you'll get a notification.
[01:58:13.720 --> 01:58:14.800]   Oh, I just saw your device.
[01:58:14.800 --> 01:58:15.800]   I just saw your device.
[01:58:15.800 --> 01:58:18.960]   It's a mind boggling because there are people everywhere with tracker software.
[01:58:18.960 --> 01:58:19.960]   It's so fantastic.
[01:58:19.960 --> 01:58:21.640]   Look at the dots on the map.
[01:58:21.640 --> 01:58:22.920]   You'll never lose anything again.
[01:58:22.920 --> 01:58:27.120]   Go to the tracker.com and to the promo code TWIT, you'll save 20% on any order.
[01:58:27.120 --> 01:58:29.680]   Pick up the tracker, bravo the tracker, Pixel.
[01:58:29.680 --> 01:58:30.840]   Get a few extra accessories.
[01:58:30.840 --> 01:58:32.320]   You can put it on your pet.
[01:58:32.320 --> 01:58:33.680]   They have a special waterproof case.
[01:58:33.680 --> 01:58:35.120]   You can put it in.
[01:58:35.120 --> 01:58:36.120]   It's awesome.

[01:58:44.880 --> 01:58:47.600]   All right, well, I'm going to wrap things up here.
[01:58:47.600 --> 01:58:48.800]   You guys have been working hard.
[01:58:48.800 --> 01:58:51.360]   I think somebody's dying of a cough.
[01:58:51.360 --> 01:58:52.360]   Was that you, Anne?
[01:58:52.360 --> 01:58:53.360]   Are you okay?
[01:58:53.360 --> 01:58:54.360]   Oh, that's me.
[01:58:54.360 --> 01:58:55.360]   It was you.
[01:58:55.360 --> 01:58:56.360]   All right.
[01:58:56.360 --> 01:58:57.360]   Well, that's me.
[01:58:57.360 --> 01:58:58.360]   All right.
[01:58:58.360 --> 01:58:59.360]   Did you get some whiskey?
[01:58:59.360 --> 01:59:00.360]   That's what's saving ants voice.
[01:59:00.360 --> 01:59:02.200]   What, what ant?
[01:59:02.200 --> 01:59:03.360]   How large are those trackers?
[01:59:03.360 --> 01:59:05.400]   I've been considering it for my drone.
[01:59:05.400 --> 01:59:07.480]   I guess they're about the size of a poco chip.
[01:59:07.480 --> 01:59:08.480]   I've lost mine.
[01:59:08.480 --> 01:59:09.480]   No, no, it's my...
[01:59:09.480 --> 01:59:11.480]   I know exactly what it is.
[01:59:11.480 --> 01:59:12.480]   It's in my own.
[01:59:12.480 --> 01:59:14.000]   You're a tracker-free tracker.
[01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:18.200]   The tracker is anodized aluminum, very light to be appropriate for a drone as a size of
[01:59:18.200 --> 01:59:21.800]   a quarter, but the pixel is even smaller and lighter.
[01:59:21.800 --> 01:59:24.440]   And so it's the size of a button almost.
[01:59:24.440 --> 01:59:26.440]   I mean, a little bigger, but it's very small.
[01:59:26.440 --> 01:59:27.440]   It'll be perfect for...
[01:59:27.440 --> 01:59:29.320]   I infected, put one of my drone.
[01:59:29.320 --> 01:59:30.320]   I did everything.
[01:59:30.320 --> 01:59:31.960]   I put the FCA registration number.
[01:59:31.960 --> 01:59:33.960]   I put my phone number.
[01:59:33.960 --> 01:59:36.920]   I know, because I know I'm going to lose this sucker someday.
[01:59:36.920 --> 01:59:40.640]   I like the idea of having something audible like that because I've crashed a few times.
[01:59:40.640 --> 01:59:43.600]   And the GPS does a decent job of getting the close to anything.
[01:59:43.600 --> 01:59:45.040]   Then it's in the grass or something.
[01:59:45.040 --> 01:59:46.040]   Yeah.
[01:59:46.040 --> 01:59:48.880]   But I like that audible feedback would be really nice.
[01:59:48.880 --> 01:59:49.880]   Yes.
[01:59:49.880 --> 01:59:50.880]   It's...
[01:59:50.880 --> 01:59:55.320]   I've lost my drone in the grass and I know it's here somewhere.
[01:59:55.320 --> 01:59:56.320]   All right.
[01:59:56.320 --> 01:59:58.160]   And if it's making the noise, here we go.
[01:59:58.160 --> 02:00:00.320]   So this is the tracker pixel.
[02:00:00.320 --> 02:00:01.320]   It's not very big.
[02:00:01.320 --> 02:00:02.320]   Yeah.
[02:00:02.320 --> 02:00:03.320]   Okay.
[02:00:03.320 --> 02:00:04.320]   It's my size of a dime.
[02:00:04.320 --> 02:00:05.320]   Maybe a nickel.
[02:00:05.320 --> 02:00:07.720]   How long does the battery left?
[02:00:07.720 --> 02:00:08.880]   That depends.
[02:00:08.880 --> 02:00:11.720]   So it's Bluetooth LE, so it's low energy.
[02:00:11.720 --> 02:00:13.720]   So it can last as long as a year.
[02:00:13.720 --> 02:00:16.040]   But I turn on all the two-way separation stuff.
[02:00:16.040 --> 02:00:20.680]   So like if you leave your keys behind, your phone hawks, if you leave your phone behind
[02:00:20.680 --> 02:00:23.560]   your keys honk, and that uses up more juice.
[02:00:23.560 --> 02:00:25.760]   But the thing is, it's just one of those CR...
[02:00:25.760 --> 02:00:27.800]   Like this one of the things, it's a CR2030 battery.
[02:00:27.800 --> 02:00:29.280]   I've got a dozen of them.
[02:00:29.280 --> 02:00:32.000]   So maybe every three to six months I'll replace it.
[02:00:32.000 --> 02:00:33.000]   Oh, can you replace it?
[02:00:33.000 --> 02:00:34.400]   Can you attach it to your cat?
[02:00:34.400 --> 02:00:35.400]   Yes, you can.
[02:00:35.400 --> 02:00:36.880]   Can you put it on your cat?
[02:00:36.880 --> 02:00:39.040]   This is fine for a cat.
[02:00:39.040 --> 02:00:40.040]   Okay.
[02:00:40.040 --> 02:00:41.040]   Good.
[02:00:41.040 --> 02:00:42.040]   Safe for a cat.
[02:00:42.040 --> 02:00:43.040]   Safe for your cat.
[02:00:43.040 --> 02:00:49.360]   I'm sad to say silently and without notice, without fanfare oracle laid off, it's entire Solaris
[02:00:49.360 --> 02:00:53.120]   tech staff last week.
[02:00:53.120 --> 02:00:59.880]   Probably the end of life of Solaris and the last, pretty much the last of Sun's products
[02:00:59.880 --> 02:01:01.280]   at Oracle.
[02:01:01.280 --> 02:01:03.800]   Oracle really bought Sun for one reason only.
[02:01:03.800 --> 02:01:08.560]   They wanted the Java rights so they could sue Google for billions.
[02:01:08.560 --> 02:01:10.200]   That was it.
[02:01:10.200 --> 02:01:11.840]   That was the real reason.
[02:01:11.840 --> 02:01:16.400]   I guess it's important to mention it because Solaris was so...
[02:01:16.400 --> 02:01:21.600]   But I don't think it had a huge impact these days.
[02:01:21.600 --> 02:01:28.640]   Amazon's looking for a second headquarters and this is a bonanza for somebody.
[02:01:28.640 --> 02:01:34.680]   It will invest $5 billion plus higher 50,000 employees.
[02:01:34.680 --> 02:01:43.560]   So they've gone around the country asking cities to bid for HQ2 and you can bet a lot
[02:01:43.560 --> 02:01:47.120]   of cities are into it and interested.
[02:01:47.120 --> 02:01:52.600]   Amazon told Seattle they're going to have 12 million square feet by 2022.
[02:01:52.600 --> 02:02:00.720]   It pretty much owns downtown Seattle, 8 million square feet with 33 billion buildings.
[02:02:00.720 --> 02:02:07.280]   So yeah, there was a really interesting graphic and I think it was the times where they said
[02:02:07.280 --> 02:02:10.640]   forget it Amazon, we'll tell you exactly where you should go and they narrowed it down to
[02:02:10.640 --> 02:02:11.640]   Denver.
[02:02:11.640 --> 02:02:14.000]   I'm sure Denver was happy to hear that.
[02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:17.520]   I would like Amazon to move to Petaluma.
[02:02:17.520 --> 02:02:22.320]   You have instant access to the Twit network.
[02:02:22.320 --> 02:02:24.680]   Power hardly ever goes out.
[02:02:24.680 --> 02:02:28.600]   We haven't had a hurricane in years and it never snows.
[02:02:28.600 --> 02:02:30.400]   They're trolling for tax breaks.
[02:02:30.400 --> 02:02:33.560]   I can't help them with tax breaks.
[02:02:33.560 --> 02:02:34.720]   You're right, of course.
[02:02:34.720 --> 02:02:36.280]   It's all about the tax breaks.
[02:02:36.280 --> 02:02:37.280]   That was my first thought.
[02:02:37.280 --> 02:02:41.080]   I was thinking about GE going to Boston and I was like...
[02:02:41.080 --> 02:02:43.800]   And then there was the...what is that Foxconn?
[02:02:43.800 --> 02:02:44.800]   That Foxconn deal?
[02:02:44.800 --> 02:02:46.600]   Oh yeah, they're in Wisconsin.
[02:02:46.600 --> 02:02:48.680]   Minnesota, Wisconsin, whatever it is.
[02:02:48.680 --> 02:02:49.680]   Is it Wisconsin or Minnesota?
[02:02:49.680 --> 02:02:56.960]   I can't remember either, but I swear that the tax breaks, I feel like these kinds of
[02:02:56.960 --> 02:03:02.360]   deals always end up not being...it's like building a new stadium or something.
[02:03:02.360 --> 02:03:04.280]   It's like they're like the jobs.
[02:03:04.280 --> 02:03:09.480]   And then five years later, the government just gave them a bunch of tax breaks and money
[02:03:09.480 --> 02:03:12.440]   to move to a place and it's not actually that much better.
[02:03:12.440 --> 02:03:13.440]   That could be wrong, obviously.
[02:03:13.440 --> 02:03:14.880]   No, to the man.
[02:03:14.880 --> 02:03:21.200]   Foxconn's going to create 13,000 jobs in Wisconsin and they're getting a $3 billion tax incentive
[02:03:21.200 --> 02:03:22.720]   for that.
[02:03:22.720 --> 02:03:24.640]   Those are expensive jobs.
[02:03:24.640 --> 02:03:29.040]   Yeah, that's a lot of money to pay for 13,000 jobs.
[02:03:29.040 --> 02:03:30.040]   Yeah.
[02:03:30.040 --> 02:03:34.840]   I figured Amazon would get in the backyard of UPS, like go to Louisville somewhere because
[02:03:34.840 --> 02:03:37.320]   there's a large airport right there too.
[02:03:37.320 --> 02:03:38.320]   Right.
[02:03:38.320 --> 02:03:39.520]   That would be a lot more efficient.
[02:03:39.520 --> 02:03:44.000]   I don't think though they're worried about product shipping from this new headquarters.
[02:03:44.000 --> 02:03:47.120]   Really it's manpower, it's personnel, it's smart people.
[02:03:47.120 --> 02:03:51.280]   They want somewhere where...so the cost of living has to be fairly low.
[02:03:51.280 --> 02:03:56.040]   Of course they want the tax breaks, but I think it's more office workers than fulfillment.
[02:03:56.040 --> 02:03:57.040]   Okay.
[02:03:57.040 --> 02:03:58.240]   Somebody said Detroit.
[02:03:58.240 --> 02:03:59.480]   I thought that was kind of an interesting one.
[02:03:59.480 --> 02:04:01.280]   I'd love to see that.
[02:04:01.280 --> 02:04:03.840]   Yeah, the Austin Court could use it.
[02:04:03.840 --> 02:04:04.840]   Yeah.
[02:04:04.840 --> 02:04:07.040]   Give them some life, you know?
[02:04:07.040 --> 02:04:14.080]   Use, if you have an AT&T universe, you might want to check your modem.
[02:04:14.080 --> 02:04:19.760]   It's unclear whether Eris, who makes the modem AT&T universe uses, or AT&T introduced some
[02:04:19.760 --> 02:04:25.680]   horrific security flaws into these modems that allow anybody, in fact I'm sure it's
[02:04:25.680 --> 02:04:28.880]   happening already, to log into your modem.
[02:04:28.880 --> 02:04:34.040]   Literally replace the firmware with their own custom firmware.
[02:04:34.040 --> 02:04:35.520]   Complete control of your modem.
[02:04:35.520 --> 02:04:38.600]   There are five flaws.
[02:04:38.600 --> 02:04:43.560]   You can SSH into the modem from anywhere because the SSH passwords are hard-coded.
[02:04:43.560 --> 02:04:45.640]   I can go on and on.
[02:04:45.640 --> 02:04:46.840]   You can run a shell.
[02:04:46.840 --> 02:04:47.840]   It's not a great shell.
[02:04:47.840 --> 02:04:51.240]   It's a seashell, but I think you'll live with it, which allows you to...
[02:04:51.240 --> 02:04:53.080]   I mean you just have absolute control.
[02:04:53.080 --> 02:04:55.520]   You run as root with a shell.
[02:04:55.520 --> 02:04:56.520]   Just log in.
[02:04:56.520 --> 02:04:58.880]   Have fun kids.
[02:04:58.880 --> 02:05:02.880]   Eris and AT&T, I guess, will have to fix this.
[02:05:02.880 --> 02:05:10.640]   Eris says we're conducting investigation and will take any required actions.
[02:05:10.640 --> 02:05:13.600]   Does it mention who brought it to AT&T's attention?
[02:05:13.600 --> 02:05:14.600]   Yeah.
[02:05:14.600 --> 02:05:15.880]   Well, it's an interesting story.
[02:05:15.880 --> 02:05:19.800]   It was a company called No Motion, an analyst there named Joseph Hutchins.
[02:05:19.800 --> 02:05:25.760]   Normally, as you know, when security researchers find a vulnerability, they wait six months,
[02:05:25.760 --> 02:05:27.200]   nine, 90 days.
[02:05:27.200 --> 02:05:29.400]   They give the company a chance to fix it.
[02:05:29.400 --> 02:05:35.120]   They said these vulnerabilities are so severe and Eris has such a terrible history of repairing
[02:05:35.120 --> 02:05:39.040]   vulnerabilities like this, they released it immediately.
[02:05:39.040 --> 02:05:40.240]   They said, "You know what?
[02:05:40.240 --> 02:05:46.600]   We're going to tell everybody now because this is such a horrific threat."
[02:05:46.600 --> 02:05:52.360]   We believe that bad guys already know, so we think users get a no right away.
[02:05:52.360 --> 02:05:56.760]   That is a violation of the traditional protocol for this kind of stuff.
[02:05:56.760 --> 02:06:03.040]   I remember I had an Eris device at one time and a buddy of mine, Charlie Hoover, gave
[02:06:03.040 --> 02:06:05.320]   me such a hard time about it.
[02:06:05.320 --> 02:06:06.320]   I didn't know.
[02:06:06.320 --> 02:06:07.320]   Charlie's great.
[02:06:07.320 --> 02:06:08.320]   Yeah.
[02:06:08.320 --> 02:06:10.640]   Charlie, he scolded me on it.
[02:06:10.640 --> 02:06:11.640]   Yeah.
[02:06:11.640 --> 02:06:14.600]   Ours Technica, Dan Gooden says hackers are lying in wait.
[02:06:14.600 --> 02:06:22.560]   They've already infiltrated our grid and they've got basically an on/off switch and they're
[02:06:22.560 --> 02:06:25.760]   just going to wait until they need it.
[02:06:25.760 --> 02:06:26.760]   Where are the hackers from?
[02:06:26.760 --> 02:06:30.960]   Well, we don't know, but it's pretty much well thought that they're the same Russian
[02:06:30.960 --> 02:06:35.200]   guys who turned the power off in the Ukraine for a few hours just to demonstrate.
[02:06:35.200 --> 02:06:36.200]   Yep.
[02:06:36.200 --> 02:06:38.200]   That seems right.
[02:06:38.200 --> 02:06:39.200]   Yep.
[02:06:39.200 --> 02:06:44.440]   Nothing more to say here except I hope you have battery backup.
[02:06:44.440 --> 02:06:46.080]   And make grids DOMR.
[02:06:46.080 --> 02:06:47.080]   Yeah.
[02:06:47.080 --> 02:06:48.080]   There may be a little...
[02:06:48.080 --> 02:06:52.480]   Well, if you're going to make a grid smart, please don't connect it to the public internet.
[02:06:52.480 --> 02:06:53.480]   Exactly.
[02:06:53.480 --> 02:06:55.720]   Who thought that was a good idea?
[02:06:55.720 --> 02:07:00.440]   Whatever you do, don't ask Equifax what to do about it.
[02:07:00.440 --> 02:07:01.440]   That's the...
[02:07:01.440 --> 02:07:02.440]   Yeah.
[02:07:02.440 --> 02:07:03.440]   Ask Equifax.
[02:07:03.440 --> 02:07:05.160]   How do you secure your data?
[02:07:05.160 --> 02:07:06.840]   And we'll end with this note.
[02:07:06.840 --> 02:07:10.360]   I'm a big fan of tech dirt, Mike Masnick.
[02:07:10.360 --> 02:07:15.200]   Mike had the temerity to call out a guy who says, "I invented email when I was a teenager
[02:07:15.200 --> 02:07:18.200]   in 1979."
[02:07:18.200 --> 02:07:20.200]   Mike said, "That's not true."
[02:07:20.200 --> 02:07:23.480]   He was immediately sued by Shiva Ayudara.
[02:07:23.480 --> 02:07:28.680]   He says he invented email in the late '70s even though I think many of us were using
[02:07:28.680 --> 02:07:32.560]   email before then.
[02:07:32.560 --> 02:07:35.440]   Tech Dirt called him a liar and a charlatan.
[02:07:35.440 --> 02:07:39.800]   Ayudara sued him in January 2017 for libel.
[02:07:39.800 --> 02:07:45.080]   On Wednesday, US District Judge F. Dennis Saylor said, "Because it's impossible to define
[02:07:45.080 --> 02:07:50.960]   precisely and specifically what email is," Ayudara's claim that is incapable of being
[02:07:50.960 --> 02:07:54.480]   proven true or false.
[02:07:54.480 --> 02:07:58.680]   And furthermore, one person may consider a claim to be fake if any element of it is not
[02:07:58.680 --> 02:08:02.520]   true or if it involves a slight twisting of the facts.
[02:08:02.520 --> 02:08:04.000]   So there's no libel here.
[02:08:04.000 --> 02:08:05.320]   The case has been thrown out.
[02:08:05.320 --> 02:08:07.520]   We don't know if he will appeal.
[02:08:07.520 --> 02:08:12.040]   "Oh, we do know he will appeal.
[02:08:12.040 --> 02:08:14.280]   Here's an update to a Goodens article.
[02:08:14.280 --> 02:08:19.680]   "Fall speech is not protected by the Constitution," says Ayudara's attorney.
[02:08:19.680 --> 02:08:25.320]   Charles Harder, you may have heard his name before in context, in another context.
[02:08:25.320 --> 02:08:29.960]   Tech Dirt's false and malicious speech about Ayudara should receive no legal protection
[02:08:29.960 --> 02:08:33.440]   and we will appeal.
[02:08:33.440 --> 02:08:36.920]   "Fall speech, it sounds like a lot like the people who scream fake news."
[02:08:36.920 --> 02:08:38.800]   It's false speech.
[02:08:38.800 --> 02:08:39.800]   "Fall speech."
[02:08:39.800 --> 02:08:40.800]   "Fall speech."
[02:08:40.800 --> 02:08:41.800]   Yeah.
[02:08:41.800 --> 02:08:42.800]   Unfortunately--
[02:08:42.800 --> 02:08:44.240]   Good protector, though.
[02:08:44.240 --> 02:08:52.480]   The judge did deny a separate motion to countersue under California's anti-slap law, which allows
[02:08:52.480 --> 02:08:58.200]   him to recover his extensive legal fees to defend himself.
[02:08:58.200 --> 02:09:01.000]   So Mike is out of pocket.
[02:09:01.000 --> 02:09:02.920]   There was-- I don't know how much of it is.
[02:09:02.920 --> 02:09:04.920]   His money, how much of it, was from a legal defense fund.
[02:09:04.920 --> 02:09:07.440]   There was a legal defense fund for him.
[02:09:07.440 --> 02:09:09.280]   I support journalism.com.
[02:09:09.280 --> 02:09:13.080]   It's not too late to help Mike Masnick out, even though he's won this case, the costs
[02:09:13.080 --> 02:09:15.760]   are huge.
[02:09:15.760 --> 02:09:22.600]   By the way, I just like to let everybody know I invented email last night in my jammies.
[02:09:22.600 --> 02:09:26.480]   If you say otherwise, you're a trouble boy.
[02:09:26.480 --> 02:09:27.480]   Fake speech.
[02:09:27.480 --> 02:09:28.480]   Fake speech.
[02:09:28.480 --> 02:09:29.480]   Fake speech.
[02:09:29.480 --> 02:09:35.560]   Well, I think we've come to the end of this fabulous gripping edition of This Week in Tech.
[02:09:35.560 --> 02:09:38.880]   If it was gripping at all, it was because of our great panel.
[02:09:38.880 --> 02:09:41.240]   So nice to have two new people in here.
[02:09:41.240 --> 02:09:42.240]   You're a Pruitt.
[02:09:42.240 --> 02:09:43.240]   We're going to have you back soon.
[02:09:43.240 --> 02:09:44.320]   It's great to have you.
[02:09:44.320 --> 02:09:45.320]   Give us a plug.
[02:09:45.320 --> 02:09:46.520]   We read you on Tech Republic.
[02:09:46.520 --> 02:09:49.280]   Where can I find your photos and your drone work?
[02:09:49.280 --> 02:09:50.280]   Sure.
[02:09:50.280 --> 02:09:53.280]   Check me out on Twitter @ant_pruit.
[02:09:53.280 --> 02:09:59.400]   Yeah, Instagram is actually Ant-pruit, no underscore.
[02:09:59.400 --> 02:10:02.760]   But better yet, go over to my YouTube channel and subscribe.
[02:10:02.760 --> 02:10:04.760]   It's all about trying to create and dominate.
[02:10:04.760 --> 02:10:06.520]   And Clemson for life, baby.
[02:10:06.520 --> 02:10:10.240]   Clemson for life.
[02:10:10.240 --> 02:10:11.240]   www.puit.com.
[02:10:11.240 --> 02:10:14.240]   A N T P U P R U I T T.
[02:10:14.240 --> 02:10:15.240]   P R U I T T.
[02:10:15.240 --> 02:10:18.240]   That's my Squarespace site.
[02:10:18.240 --> 02:10:21.040]   Ah, nice job.
[02:10:21.040 --> 02:10:22.640]   It's beautiful.
[02:10:22.640 --> 02:10:27.360]   In a lot of pictures of Clemson football, but also high school football, your son's
[02:10:27.360 --> 02:10:29.720]   playing and I love it.
[02:10:29.720 --> 02:10:30.720]   I love it.
[02:10:30.720 --> 02:10:31.720]   It's great.
[02:10:31.720 --> 02:10:32.720]   Thank you, sir.
[02:10:32.720 --> 02:10:33.720]   It was great having you.
[02:10:33.720 --> 02:10:34.720]   Come back soon.
[02:10:34.720 --> 02:10:37.120]   Same goes to you, Ben Johnson, your first time on the Big Shoe.
[02:10:37.120 --> 02:10:41.400]   That's what I hope you will be back depending on what job you take on Monday.
[02:10:41.400 --> 02:10:45.720]   If you're working for the NSA, I can't promise you a seat.
[02:10:45.720 --> 02:10:46.720]   It's great to be here.
[02:10:46.720 --> 02:10:48.200]   Like I said, I've been a long time fan of the show.
[02:10:48.200 --> 02:10:49.920]   I was honored to be asked.
[02:10:49.920 --> 02:10:52.760]   I'd love to come back if you'll have me.
[02:10:52.760 --> 02:10:53.760]   Of course.
[02:10:53.760 --> 02:10:58.680]   I'll just say that what I'm doing on Monday has something to do with a website they call
[02:10:58.680 --> 02:11:00.400]   the front page of the internet.
[02:11:00.400 --> 02:11:03.600]   So you can work your way through that.
[02:11:03.600 --> 02:11:04.600]   Ooh.
[02:11:04.600 --> 02:11:06.800]   Are you going to Boston?
[02:11:06.800 --> 02:11:08.720]   Are you going to Boston there?
[02:11:08.720 --> 02:11:10.960]   So are you in Boston?
[02:11:10.960 --> 02:11:11.960]   Where are you now?
[02:11:11.960 --> 02:11:12.960]   Yeah.
[02:11:12.960 --> 02:11:16.960]   I'm at my parents house, actually, in Western Massachusetts.
[02:11:16.960 --> 02:11:20.400]   That's because you had to evacuate because of Hurricane Irma.
[02:11:20.400 --> 02:11:24.080]   Did your parents have that nice sound blanket?
[02:11:24.080 --> 02:11:26.720]   You've got hang behind you.
[02:11:26.720 --> 02:11:31.680]   This is going to go on their bed when this is over.
[02:11:31.680 --> 02:11:32.680]   Very honest.
[02:11:32.680 --> 02:11:33.680]   Great to have you, Ben.
[02:11:33.680 --> 02:11:35.760]   Good luck at the front page of the internet.
[02:11:35.760 --> 02:11:36.760]   That's awesome.
[02:11:36.760 --> 02:11:41.560]   Codebreaker.codes for his fabulous podcast.
[02:11:41.560 --> 02:11:47.680]   And of course, PED30, PED30.com is a place to go to find Philip Elmer to win who will
[02:11:47.680 --> 02:11:53.200]   be the first to let us know what Apple does with iPhone X.
[02:11:53.200 --> 02:11:57.600]   And hopefully have a YouTube video of everybody walking in.
[02:11:57.600 --> 02:11:59.320]   I thought you were going to stream on Facebook.
[02:11:59.320 --> 02:12:00.640]   Make up your mind, man.
[02:12:00.640 --> 02:12:01.640]   Oh, face.
[02:12:01.640 --> 02:12:02.640]   No, YouTube.
[02:12:02.640 --> 02:12:03.640]   YouTube.
[02:12:03.640 --> 02:12:04.640]   You're going to do YouTube live.
[02:12:04.640 --> 02:12:06.440]   You're going to stream it from your phone.
[02:12:06.440 --> 02:12:07.440]   Yeah.
[02:12:07.440 --> 02:12:08.440]   Awesome.
[02:12:08.440 --> 02:12:09.440]   I'm going to try to do awesome.
[02:12:09.440 --> 02:12:10.440]   I'm in Western Mass as well.
[02:12:10.440 --> 02:12:11.440]   Where are you?
[02:12:11.440 --> 02:12:12.440]   Oh, man.
[02:12:12.440 --> 02:12:13.440]   I'm in Amherst.
[02:12:13.440 --> 02:12:15.440]   Oh, I'm in Greenfield.
[02:12:15.440 --> 02:12:18.280]   We're like 30 minutes away.
[02:12:18.280 --> 02:12:20.480]   I'll meet you in Sunderland.
[02:12:20.480 --> 02:12:24.040]   Actually, Western Mass is gorgeous.
[02:12:24.040 --> 02:12:25.520]   That's where Tanglewood is right.
[02:12:25.520 --> 02:12:27.520]   And yeah, my grandmother.
[02:12:27.520 --> 02:12:29.920]   You're thinking of the Berkshires.
[02:12:29.920 --> 02:12:31.720]   It's a little further west.
[02:12:31.720 --> 02:12:35.320]   Even far the Western Mass is Eastern New York.
[02:12:35.320 --> 02:12:36.320]   It's a good Valley.
[02:12:36.320 --> 02:12:37.320]   Yeah.
[02:12:37.320 --> 02:12:39.200]   Oh, the Berkshires is.
[02:12:39.200 --> 02:12:40.200]   Yes.
[02:12:40.200 --> 02:12:41.200]   Yeah.
[02:12:41.200 --> 02:12:42.200]   Yeah.
[02:12:42.200 --> 02:12:43.200]   I've been spent some time there.
[02:12:43.200 --> 02:12:46.680]   My grandmother had a house in Western Mass as well.
[02:12:46.680 --> 02:12:47.680]   Come out.
[02:12:47.680 --> 02:12:48.680]   Do a twit from here, man.
[02:12:48.680 --> 02:12:49.680]   I should.
[02:12:49.680 --> 02:12:51.680]   You know, the leaves are going to change any day now.
[02:12:51.680 --> 02:12:52.680]   That's right.
[02:12:52.680 --> 02:12:54.040]   We got cider donuts waiting for you.
[02:12:54.040 --> 02:12:55.040]   Love it.
[02:12:55.040 --> 02:12:57.480]   I could live on cider and donuts.
[02:12:57.480 --> 02:13:00.880]   We do this week in tech every Saturday afternoon, 3 p.m.
[02:13:00.880 --> 02:13:03.880]   Pacific for us, 6 p.m. Eastern for them.
[02:13:03.880 --> 02:13:08.120]   That'd be 2,200 UTC for the rest of you listening around the world.
[02:13:08.120 --> 02:13:09.640]   You can do the math.
[02:13:09.640 --> 02:13:16.560]   You can watch us live at twit.tv/live or, well, if you do, by the way, join us in the chat
[02:13:16.560 --> 02:13:18.360]   room, irc.twit.tv.
[02:13:18.360 --> 02:13:19.360]   That's a fun place to be.
[02:13:19.360 --> 02:13:22.280]   And every once in a while, one of our panelists will actually go in there.
[02:13:22.280 --> 02:13:23.840]   Brave the lions, Dennis.
[02:13:23.840 --> 02:13:25.080]   Ant did this way.
[02:13:25.080 --> 02:13:29.760]   This is like the most, the nicest chat room, by the way, I've ever.
[02:13:29.760 --> 02:13:31.440]   No, they are really part of it.
[02:13:31.440 --> 02:13:33.120]   They are on their best behavior.
[02:13:33.120 --> 02:13:34.360]   Did I say it's on Saturdays?
[02:13:34.360 --> 02:13:35.560]   I'm an idiot.
[02:13:35.560 --> 02:13:37.360]   It's Sunday, right?
[02:13:37.360 --> 02:13:38.360]   Okay.
[02:13:38.360 --> 02:13:39.360]   3 p.m.
[02:13:39.360 --> 02:13:40.360]   Thank you.
[02:13:40.360 --> 02:13:44.680]   Ant knows screen saver Saturdays, twit on Sundays.
[02:13:44.680 --> 02:13:49.160]   If you can't watch live because Leo's confused about the date and time, just go to the website
[02:13:49.160 --> 02:13:51.680]   twit.tv and download a copy.
[02:13:51.680 --> 02:13:53.400]   We have lots of episodes there.
[02:13:53.400 --> 02:13:54.400]   Search for Jerry Pournell.
[02:13:54.400 --> 02:13:57.240]   You can find one of the 20 episodes of twit he appeared on.
[02:13:57.240 --> 02:14:00.720]   There's also two great triangulations with Jerry where he talks about his life and time.
[02:14:00.720 --> 02:14:03.760]   So it would be fun to listen to again.
[02:14:03.760 --> 02:14:05.440]   You can also get our show by subscribing.
[02:14:05.440 --> 02:14:07.400]   There's so many great podcast clients out there.

[02:14:09.120 --> 02:14:12.680]   It'll be ready for you Monday morning on your way to work.
[02:14:12.680 --> 02:14:18.840]   Overcast, pocket cast, ditches, slacker, iTunes, you know, and even some great twit apps.
[02:14:18.840 --> 02:14:20.680]   There are lots of great twit apps.
[02:14:20.680 --> 02:14:21.840]   Subscribing you won't miss an episode.
[02:14:21.840 --> 02:14:22.840]   Thanks for being here.
[02:14:22.840 --> 02:14:23.840]   Thanks to our studio audience.
[02:14:23.840 --> 02:14:24.840]   Great bunch here.
[02:14:24.840 --> 02:14:27.200]   If you want to be in the studio, all you have to do is email tickets.
[02:14:27.200 --> 02:14:29.680]   Twit.tv will put a chair for you.
[02:14:29.680 --> 02:14:32.240]   I will see you in three weeks.
[02:14:32.240 --> 02:14:34.720]   I'm going to take the week off, next couple of weeks off.
[02:14:34.720 --> 02:14:40.120]   Jason Calicanis will be our host next week and he's put together a crazy ass panel.
[02:14:40.120 --> 02:14:41.120]   I don't know.
[02:14:41.120 --> 02:14:45.120]   I should probably not even say because I want you to be surprised.
[02:14:45.120 --> 02:14:46.560]   But do tune in next Sunday.
[02:14:46.560 --> 02:14:50.480]   And then it's Becky Worley, the Sunday following, right?
[02:14:50.480 --> 02:14:51.720]   Becky Worley is going to be my host.
[02:14:51.720 --> 02:14:56.320]   And I'll be back September, no, October 1st on Twit.
[02:14:56.320 --> 02:14:57.320]   I'll see you in a few weeks.
[02:14:57.320 --> 02:14:58.320]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:14:58.320 --> 02:15:00.320]   Another twit is in the can.
[02:15:00.320 --> 02:15:01.320]   Bye-bye.
[02:15:01.320 --> 02:15:01.320]   [Music]
[02:15:01.320 --> 02:15:08.320]   [Music]
[02:15:08.320 --> 02:15:11.120]   Do a little twist. All right. Do a little twist
