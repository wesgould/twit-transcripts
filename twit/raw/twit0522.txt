[00:02:12.640 --> 00:02:17.280]   And a good day everybody. Leo LaPorte here with Terry McCracken, the technologist.
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:18.960]   -Here we are. -Fast company. Good to see you.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:21.160]   -Great to be here. -Still with the iPad.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:24.680]   Still with my iPad and my M-T-N-T-N keyboard.
[00:02:24.680 --> 00:02:28.920]   This is the one I've tried almost all of them and this is the one I'm stuck with.
[00:02:28.920 --> 00:02:34.640]   I'm just blown away that you... I mean, I thought like two years ago when you came here just with an iPad that...
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.000]   Oh, this is just a little... you know, he's testing it out.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.640]   I think I'm heading into like my... I believe this fall.
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:42.920]   It will have been three years since I started using this as my primary device.
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:45.360]   Nice. Wow.
[00:02:45.360 --> 00:02:50.320]   Also here all the way from Chennai, aka Madras.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:54.760]   Jill Duffy is joining us from PCMag. She's contributing editor there. Hi, Jill.
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:55.680]   Hello.
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.280]   I apologize. It's 3.30 in the morning.
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:02:59.840]   I am so...
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:01.840]   Yeah, that's all right. I'm a morning person.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:04.440]   Did you stay up later? Did you get up early?
[00:03:04.440 --> 00:03:08.320]   I just woke up. Yeah. So I'll hang out with you.
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:11.920]   I might go for a walk while it's nice and cool as the sun comes up.
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:13.280]   And then I'll take a nap later.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:16.880]   How hot does it get there in the... like the heat of the summer?
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:21.080]   I think this year it topped out around 110.
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:23.880]   There was a real bad heat wave here earlier.
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:25.440]   Oh, I remember that.
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:27.200]   That was a big deal.
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:29.280]   Yeah. Yeah. It was a really big deal.
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:31.280]   Yeah, I do remember that.
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:34.960]   Also here from San Francisco, and it's been so long since we've seen you.
[00:03:34.960 --> 00:03:37.600]   I'm so glad to welcome you back to our microphones.
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.760]   Oh, Malek.
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.200]   How are you doing, Leo?
[00:03:41.200 --> 00:03:43.280]   I am great, Ohm.
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:49.280]   And I haven't seen you since the tragic fall of Giga Ohm.
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.640]   But you've recovered?
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:53.760]   I have.
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:55.200]   You feeling all right?
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.000]   I have. It must have been a while, a little bit of mourning at some point for that.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.080]   I think six months is longer now.
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:03.760]   Oh, geez. Yeah.
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.680]   But I can understand it. I mean...
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:09.120]   We work in technology. Things happen. You move on.
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:17.760]   Your primary business now, and actually had been before Giga Ohm went away, was investing anyway, right?
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:22.480]   I joined True Ventures for a time in first month of 2014.
[00:04:22.480 --> 00:04:25.280]   And I'm there as a general partner.
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:27.680]   You know, look at interesting technologies.
[00:04:27.680 --> 00:04:32.240]   And occasionally, right on my personal blog, Ohm.co.
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.920]   Hope to write more this after the summer is over.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:40.880]   I started writing for New Yorker and Bloomberg a little bit.
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:41.920]   Oh, really?
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:42.560]   Yeah.
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:44.800]   Just, you know, occasionally not.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:47.520]   I don't think I'm very good with deadlines.
[00:04:47.520 --> 00:04:49.600]   Are you submitting little talk of the town pieces?
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:54.240]   Like, you know, you won't believe what happened in San Francisco the other night, that kind of stuff?
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:55.600]   I wish I could.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.120]   I don't point nobody wants that.
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:04:59.840]   Maybe I don't have that on my own blog.
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:01.440]   Ohm, Malek. Man about town.
[00:05:01.440 --> 00:05:03.520]   I like it.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:07.760]   Giga Ohm got purchased by a company called Knowingly.
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:09.440]   I got no knowledge of that.
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:09.760]   Yeah.
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:12.240]   Yeah. If I were you, I'd disavow it.
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.440]   All knowledge of it as well.
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:18.800]   It was so weird because I got, I got in my feed, I got a new article.
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:19.760]   I got two new articles.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:20.640]   I thought, what the heck?
[00:05:20.640 --> 00:05:22.320]   Is it alive again?
[00:05:22.320 --> 00:05:22.960]   Yeah.
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.600]   They, well, two articles, if that makes it alive.
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:26.960]   I haven't seen any of the new stuff yet.
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:28.560]   Um, you know what?
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:30.080]   They're feature articles.
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:34.080]   They're not hard news articles, but they're, uh, they're interesting.
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:38.160]   Um, you know, they're not very often.
[00:05:38.160 --> 00:05:44.000]   Um, actually there's more now since I, since I, uh, saw it.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.920]   So they had an interview with Stephen Wolfram,
[00:05:45.920 --> 00:05:48.240]   and then they talked about the Reddit kerfuffle.
[00:05:48.240 --> 00:05:51.280]   It seems like there's only two people working there,
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:52.960]   but maybe, maybe more will come.
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:58.640]   Uh, anyway, it's not even though, and this is, this is the weird thing,
[00:05:58.640 --> 00:05:59.840]   because it has your name on it.
[00:05:59.840 --> 00:06:02.720]   It's a good lesson.
[00:06:02.720 --> 00:06:03.360]   Yes.
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:04.480]   We're just not a company with your name.
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:06.000]   And don't put your name on it.
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.400]   I mean, next time around, I'm not going to do that.
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:12.080]   And I'm putting your name on it.
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:12.560]   Yep.
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:15.040]   Notice the name, not on Twitch.
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:16.320]   No word is the name up here.
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:21.840]   I thought, you know, that was an oversight by you in the early days.
[00:06:21.840 --> 00:06:22.960]   Did you really see it?
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:23.120]   Yeah.
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:23.200]   Yeah.
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:26.160]   I thought it was like, you should do a Leel Laportio.
[00:06:26.160 --> 00:06:26.400]   Yeah.
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.200]   And like, well, in hindsight, that's actually better.
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:30.960]   Unlike you, I'm an unassuming guy.
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.080]   Yeah.
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:33.280]   Yeah.
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:34.800]   [Laughter]
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.800]   Om is probably the humblest man I know.
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.480]   In fact, he's a role model for everybody in the industry.
[00:06:40.480 --> 00:06:41.120]   Totally.
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:41.600]   Yeah.
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:42.720]   So great to have you back.
[00:06:42.720 --> 00:06:43.520]   It's good to see you.
[00:06:43.520 --> 00:06:48.320]   And I'm sure that you watch as things happen and wish that, gosh, I wish I had,
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:49.840]   I need, I want to talk about that.
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:51.040]   Okay.
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.480]   Have you felt that way lately?
[00:06:52.480 --> 00:06:57.440]   Things about tech stories that you go, I would love to.
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:06:57.920]   Yeah.
[00:06:57.920 --> 00:06:58.400]   Oh, yeah.
[00:06:58.400 --> 00:06:58.960]   All the time.
[00:06:58.960 --> 00:07:01.680]   I'd love to weigh in on this Reddit controversy, that kind of thing.
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:02.160]   Yeah.
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:02.640]   Okay.
[00:07:02.640 --> 00:07:04.320]   I mean, you know, a lot.
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.240]   Like, you know, you can't change your stripes.
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:06.560]   Yeah.
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.760]   Just because, you know, you're not in the game anymore.
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.840]   I noticed when I was on vacation, I would do that.
[00:07:11.840 --> 00:07:14.880]   I would just stand in front of the mirror and talk for half an hour about something.
[00:07:14.880 --> 00:07:15.600]   [Laughter]
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:16.960]   It's really kind of embarrassing.
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:22.000]   So, anything happen this way?
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:22.400]   Yeah.
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:25.360]   I feel like, I don't, did anything go on this week?
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:27.360]   Any big stories in the news?
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:29.360]   I read a great story on Wired Magazine,
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:32.880]   actually kind of caught my interest about messaging.
[00:07:32.880 --> 00:07:36.240]   Actually, I thought this would be kind of a fun one to start with.
[00:07:36.240 --> 00:07:45.600]   Its author, David Pierce, says, "Can we just decide to have one messaging platform that we all use?"
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:52.320]   I feel like the next big thing, there it is.
[00:07:52.320 --> 00:07:55.360]   Kill the ad.
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:56.880]   It says, "Screw texting.
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:07:59.360]   It's time to pick a universal messaging app.
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:02.240]   In the states, we use SMS.
[00:08:02.240 --> 00:08:06.480]   But there are a lot of apps vying for our attention.
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:11.920]   And when you hear that Facebook paid $22 billion for what's app,
[00:08:11.920 --> 00:08:14.480]   I think a lot of people in the US were puzzled by that.
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:16.800]   Like, how could that be worth that much?
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:20.160]   But in fact, outside of the states, these apps are dominant.
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.000]   Pierce talks about WeChat.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.040]   WeChat is huge.
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:25.440]   In China, half a million active users.
[00:08:25.440 --> 00:08:27.600]   And he points out, it's more than just messaging.
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:32.720]   There are WeChat stars, just there's YouTuber, Instagram stars or Vine stars,
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:35.440]   that people buy train tickets, they get their laundry done.
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:37.920]   They do everything.
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:40.320]   They live in WeChat, which I haven't had that experience.
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:42.320]   Same thing in Japan with Line.
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:43.120]   Line is amazing.
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:46.320]   How people live online, and it really is sort of an all-inclusive platform.
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:48.640]   You play games on it, you order pizza on it.
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:54.000]   We are, meanwhile, in the states, kind of in a situation, I guess, kind of as instant messaging
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.200]   was in the early days where there's people on ICQ, there's people on AIM,
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:02.480]   there's people on Microsoft Messenger, there's no unified platform.
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:08.720]   Is that the question, I'll pose you, all, is that the next big thing?
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:13.280]   Messaging is already here as the next big thing.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:17.840]   And Facebook really wants to take Messenger and make it into something a lot more like WeChat
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:18.320]   or Line.
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:23.760]   Last year, when Facebook told everybody that they were splitting off Messenger from Facebook,
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:28.160]   and you'd have to download and use a different app, it ticked off a lot of people and people
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:31.840]   were puzzled, and it became clear eventually that the reason they did it was because they
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:36.560]   wanted to make Messenger into an all-encompassing platform, similar to the ones people use in other
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:36.960]   countries.
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:38.560]   Yeah, it's obvious.
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:42.000]   Now, although, after all, Facebook buy, what's app?
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:43.840]   Well, also about WhatsApp, so they have two of them.
[00:09:43.840 --> 00:09:47.360]   And WhatsApp, I mean, the theory is it won't be like that.
[00:09:47.360 --> 00:09:50.880]   WhatsApp is going to stick to its knitting and be focused on messaging.
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:54.880]   And it's never going to be inundated with ads because they want to advertise in.
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:09:57.600]   What do you-- go ahead, O.
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:04.640]   The funny thing is that I read that article and my first reaction was an old personal reaction,
[00:10:04.640 --> 00:10:07.600]   "Yeah, we need a unified messaging app."
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:16.080]   But in reality is today, the different demographics, different people, different geographic locations,
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:22.160]   people use applications differently. So that is why we have so many different applications.
[00:10:22.160 --> 00:10:30.480]   So Slack has a certain purpose in our life, just like SMS or iMessage has a certain purpose in
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:38.240]   WhatsApp and so Facebook Messenger. So I think to dream of a unified app is just kind of like
[00:10:38.240 --> 00:10:44.800]   a childish dream to have. I think there should be a little bit more interoperability between the
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:50.400]   various services. But I think it's more like, you know, think of messaging platforms as
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:56.640]   communication network, all social networks, if you look at the way they are, they are essentially
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:02.320]   messaging or communication platforms from Facebook. You know, people communicate it through
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:10.480]   status and photos and updates and then it became messages and now they have a Facebook Messenger.
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:17.280]   So I think we have messaging and communications that are core to social human behavior and
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:23.040]   like every so often we reinvented. I think if you remember Skype and they came out
[00:11:23.040 --> 00:11:29.520]   since all the people were on Skype, Skype took off and all the other services didn't really take
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:36.960]   off even though they were still there. Now you see the same thing with the current generation
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:42.080]   of messaging apps they're taking off because you know we just like to communicate all the time.
[00:11:42.080 --> 00:11:48.400]   That's like a very fundamental human need. I think it's like something I've been writing about
[00:11:48.400 --> 00:11:55.760]   for almost 20 plus years is that we always overlook that at the end of the day what really
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:12:02.400]   makes the internet work is our ability to communicate and interact. The next generation of interaction
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:08.320]   is essentially what's happened in VChad. So and they will all remain different from each other.
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:14.720]   I don't think that we need to have all of them in one package like the way that the wired right
[00:12:14.720 --> 00:12:21.360]   through was trying to persuade us. But if that's true, how do you account for the fact that
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:27.680]   VChad is used by half a billion people or that line is used by the majority of Japanese users?
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:33.120]   I mean it's everybody has a line ID. Yeah it's even though it's a messaging app it's more
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:37.920]   comparable to Facebook in terms of sort of it's importance. We've had unified apps before like
[00:12:37.920 --> 00:12:44.080]   Trillion and Pigeon and those two. It's never as satisfying though it seems to me as using them.
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:49.760]   If we were all using one app Jill what do you do you now see you're an interesting position.
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:57.360]   I have a lot. Yeah I have a lot of international friends and we use WhatsApp as a simple messenger
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:02.880]   that everybody signed up for early on. And I think it was sort of similar to Skype in the early days.
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:06.800]   Everybody's got a Skype account. This is what we were going to use and it was a simple enough
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:12.640]   tool that once we all had accounts it was fine. I think when you look at something like the Chinese
[00:13:12.640 --> 00:13:16.560]   market you know you have to remember that it's its own market in a lot of ways. You have a lot of
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:23.040]   people in one country that has its own special technological challenges. So and it makes sense
[00:13:23.040 --> 00:13:30.240]   that in the timeline of how China's technology has rolled out that they came to have a different
[00:13:30.240 --> 00:13:35.360]   messaging platform among the majority of their people at a different time than other parts of the
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:41.440]   world. And I agree with what Om was saying too that you know I don't want one messenger for all
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:47.520]   of my needs. So when I use business communication tools I want to have something else that lets me
[00:13:47.520 --> 00:13:55.680]   more easily search my history, upload large files, mark up PDFs. And that's a different kind of service
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:14:01.920]   than maybe having very private quick one-on-one communication with my friends where my main
[00:14:01.920 --> 00:14:06.400]   concern there is did they get my message? Did they read my message? You know I just that's all I want
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:11.280]   is that confirmation. So I think they're very very different uses and I think there should be a lot
[00:14:11.280 --> 00:14:16.560]   of room for lots of different messengers. And you don't want to use a messaging app that your parents
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:22.720]   use. Oh no I certainly want my mom to be able to message. No you want to use the same one as they
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:27.920]   use when you message them but not the same one you use when you message your friends. Or is that
[00:14:27.920 --> 00:14:32.960]   not true? I don't know if I'd agree with that. I mean the other one that I use. I know my kids
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:40.000]   don't want to use the messenger app my I use that's for sure. What is the other one SMS? No just I
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:45.920]   message your app. So here's the issue. So here's the issue. My US friends have Apple products. They
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:52.560]   all have iPhones. Right and Max. I don't like being a green bubble on your phone. Once
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:59.360]   Apple enabled everything to be synchronous right so that you could get messages and SMS
[00:14:59.360 --> 00:15:06.960]   on your Mac and on your iPad as well as your phone. That kind of helped that platform move along. So
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:11.760]   again we don't have to rely on having a cellular network. We can use it over Wi-Fi. So for a lot
[00:15:11.760 --> 00:15:17.760]   of people that works too. It doesn't seem like the ideal situation. I reject your premise
[00:15:17.760 --> 00:15:28.000]   Ohm that I'm just an old man. I live in the mirror lady. I feel like all of us would like one
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.640]   platform that just does it. No I agree with Ohm that interoperability would be nice but we've
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:39.200]   been waiting for it since the 1990s at one point when it was all about aim versus ICQ versus MSN
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:44.080]   messenger. The theory was they'd all talk to each other and that went almost nowhere. And I don't
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:48.000]   see any evidence today that any of the major platforms are serious. So they're not going to
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:52.800]   talk to me else. Yeah they want to keep you within their their garden walls. Facebook has added
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:58.320]   payments to messenger. By the way they've got to come up with a new name since they're all messenger
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:02.640]   right. This is very confusing. They've well maybe that's intentional. They want it to be the messenger.
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:09.520]   According to this article rumored to be doing something called money penny which would be a
[00:16:09.520 --> 00:16:15.600]   personal assistant messenger like on an automated personal assistant. Those things exist already.
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:21.120]   And here's an interesting listing from Apple for an applications engineer for Android.
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:25.760]   And what's really interesting of course you figure well Apple music needs an Android Apple.
[00:16:25.760 --> 00:16:28.720]   If they're not well on their way to finishing that then they're in trouble.
[00:16:28.720 --> 00:16:36.560]   The implication is it says exciting new mobile products to the Android platform besides
[00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:44.800]   the music and move apps. I find that intriguing. Maybe Apple wants to do a native Android iMessage.
[00:16:44.800 --> 00:16:51.920]   What do you think? That would make you happy. Well it feels like they all would love to.
[00:16:51.920 --> 00:16:57.120]   Wouldn't you want to be the guy when you want to be we chat in China or line in Japan.
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:00.720]   Wouldn't you want to be that guy. When FaceTime came out originally they said they were going to
[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:04.800]   open it up. They never did. They still haven't although they never said they were going to write
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:09.200]   all the apps themselves. They said they would let other people write the apps. Apple and that's
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:15.120]   my complaint with even though you can use iMessage with SMS I'm always a blue bubble green bubble in
[00:17:15.120 --> 00:17:21.520]   the message and apparently I didn't even know this. People discriminate against green bubbles.
[00:17:22.320 --> 00:17:28.080]   Also if you're driving back and forth that's a real headache. I'm told and there was a I mean
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:33.120]   I'm told by my kids oh yeah you're if it like when we're doing group messaging you can't be
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:39.760]   part of group messaging because you're a green bubble so we just leave you out. We don't include you.
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:45.840]   Well I think that's that's kind of a good point too is that social networks are social right and
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:50.400]   messaging I would say is a social network. The way that people behave online is similar to the way
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:58.000]   that we behave in life and especially when you're younger you don't want to be one of the large
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:02.240]   large large group right like you don't necessarily want to be included in the biggest thing. You want
[00:18:02.240 --> 00:18:07.360]   to have your own niche environment where people are like you right so it's that social behavior of
[00:18:07.360 --> 00:18:12.320]   wanting to be with your group and I think that can certainly happen with messaging right like you
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:18.480]   want to be in the platform that is representative of you and your people. I would say what makes
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:23.280]   something like WeChat successful is that has that within it right like there are sort of subcultures
[00:18:23.280 --> 00:18:29.920]   within WeChat so maybe that's part of the problem is that the messaging platforms we have don't allow
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:36.640]   for that differentiation between people. We have I mean I I told my wife can we just use a Facebook
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:43.360]   messenger because it's got stickers it's got more stuff and we did one message and then it's back to
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:47.760]   SMS so I don't I feel like this isn't going to happen in the United States so you probably write
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:51.920]   them and it is and I guess we don't want to all be on the same platform we want different
[00:18:51.920 --> 00:18:58.800]   tools I just bothers me that I have HipChat slack line wire messenger
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:06.720]   feels like Google's missing the boat here hangouts could be a unified platform that unifies a lot of
[00:19:06.720 --> 00:19:09.680]   people but they're not making many efforts in that direction. They were sort of on the cusp of
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:13.920]   that and then they walked away from it. I don't understand Google at all. If there was like a
[00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:17.840]   consumer a personal version of slack that could be really appealing to me because I love slack.
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:21.600]   I'm on slack all day for work. You know I've heard that people actually do use it for
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:26.720]   as consumer they have slack groups and they'll do stuff and you can have slack is kind of cool
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:32.720]   because you can have bots and you know you can it can be elaborate every time I type certain phrases
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:38.640]   and we use slack with our web team and when I type certain phrases it's slack like Borat shows up
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:45.520]   every time I say something like nice move Borat goes yeah and just it's very customizable and very
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:52.640]   powerful. Maybe that's what's missing is that there isn't that if we all use the same platform we
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:56.480]   could all be speaking the same language. I know you're right all much it's old-fashioned the idea that
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:20:02.560]   we we used to all watch the same TV show Sunday nights. Yeah and I'll be watching different different
[00:20:02.560 --> 00:20:09.920]   things and we're fun and you know we're in a more fragmented world. You're all unique snowflakes.
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:16.720]   Oh god I'm just an old one. All right let's take a break we're gonna come back. I really I thought
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:21.680]   you guys would all join me and we could all team up we could create a movement to all use whatever
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:25.920]   but that's what would it be I mean I don't want it to be Facebook I don't want Facebook to win I
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:30.080]   guess that's the problem I do not want Facebook because if Facebook's already won one and a half
[00:20:30.080 --> 00:20:38.560]   billion monthly active users on the Facebook platform 300 million on Instagram what is the what's
[00:20:38.560 --> 00:20:46.000]   app is it it's got to be at least that 800 800 800 I think I'm I guess they've already won
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:54.720]   if they if they okay if they put a personal assistant if they put more features in the messenger
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:20:59.680]   would we could you think that that could they could win is it possible to win in the US anyway
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:07.200]   I think their big messenger would be their play in non-China markets I don't think they can win in
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:14.320]   China or some of the other big Asian countries like you know like in Korea or in Japan but they can
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:19.360]   you know messenger could be a huge win for them in India for example like they're massive in India
[00:21:19.360 --> 00:21:25.280]   I think that's where their big numbers are coming from. Oh really interesting Africa is another place
[00:21:25.280 --> 00:21:30.560]   where messenger could be huge I think a lot of people don't really realize it that you know WhatsApp
[00:21:30.560 --> 00:21:37.600]   got a lot of traction in Africa you know BBC used to publish a lot of stories in WhatsApp and
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:46.640]   people that created Slack like groups inside WhatsApp and BBC used that to cover you know elections
[00:21:46.640 --> 00:21:53.280]   and both in Nigeria and Kenya I mean so like you know these societies are much more mobile first
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:59.680]   and much more advanced compared to to us so I think if you're looking at Facebook to make an effort
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:07.360]   it would be I would say it would it would be in in in places like India and many parts of Africa
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:12.960]   some parts of you know Latin America where they are massive I would not be surprised if it becomes
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:18.080]   a dominant global messaging well and there's considerable money to be made in in banking
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:26.080]   and Africa and PACEA money transfer yeah it's very successful does M PACEA goes over the text or
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:31.120]   the messaging network yeah text messaging text messaging you know they hired the Facebook hired
[00:22:31.120 --> 00:22:38.560]   the guy who was running PayPal to to lead the the messenger effort yeah David Marcus yeah David
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:45.200]   Marcus is leading a huge effort a pushing to commerce inside the messenger platform so it'd
[00:22:45.200 --> 00:22:51.600]   be interesting to see what what they can they can actually achieve but you know it looks pretty
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:56.880]   promising and we talk a lot about you know the next big thing being virtual reality and stuff like
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:03.040]   that messenger messaging platforms seem like kind of a mundane subject and yet that's to me that
[00:23:03.040 --> 00:23:09.680]   seems like there is a battle raging but kind of between these big companies and because there's no
[00:23:09.680 --> 00:23:14.640]   incumbent there's no big winner it's gonna be very interesting so 20 plus years of covering
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:21.680]   communications and and messaging so for the longest time the only way you could monetize
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:28.480]   messaging was like in the early days it was through SMS when Skype and all came you essentially
[00:23:28.480 --> 00:23:35.120]   bought minutes and like buckets of minutes but now you know with mobile things of advanced to a
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:42.080]   level where we can actually start to think about making commerce commerce and and like not just
[00:23:42.080 --> 00:23:49.440]   commerce like you know I'm like like why can't I have a subscription group where I share a link
[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:55.280]   to read an article if there's a fiber you know just you get the link and it only is available to
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:24:01.200]   that group and you read it and you go away after that and you know the only like you can share it
[00:24:01.200 --> 00:24:06.320]   you can do anything it's confined to that I mean that's what WhatsApp can do that's what you know
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:11.280]   Slack can do as I think there is a lot more promise in messaging and communications now
[00:24:11.920 --> 00:24:18.160]   you know I'm a firm believer in the whole idea of this conversational user interface the
[00:24:18.160 --> 00:24:25.600]   emergence of intelligent bots which allow us to automate a lot of things we do on the network
[00:24:25.600 --> 00:24:30.640]   I think those are things you know they they're not they're not too far off they're like within
[00:24:30.640 --> 00:24:37.760]   12 to you know 48 months time frame we're gonna start to see a lot of these services become the
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:44.320]   industry and of course Microsoft is not being counted out here because whether anybody realizes
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:50.160]   it or not they are all in on Skype and in fact on Windows 10 they've started the movement towards
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:55.520]   separating Skype messaging into a separate application just as Facebook did with its messaging
[00:24:55.520 --> 00:25:02.160]   and I think that Microsoft wants to get back into this business it gave up on an MSN messenger
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:06.160]   quite famously a few years ago but I think they want to get back into this everybody's looking at
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:12.000]   this. The problem with Microsoft is that they kind of get too distracted with making a lot of
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:17.760]   complex bringing complex features into their products instead of trying to stay simple I think
[00:25:17.760 --> 00:25:24.160]   you know Facebook messengers are really simple WhatsApp really simple if you I used to use line
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:32.000]   and we chat and they were pretty simple in an easy to understand on day one and then you know
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:38.480]   over a period of time they have taught us new behaviors so I think it just is very important to
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:45.600]   not forget how important it is for us to have simple interface. You know Skype is actually a
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:53.280]   degraded experience I only have negative feelings about Skype. You mentioned behavior and I think
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:56.800]   that that's part of this too is human behavior is changing we don't make phone calls as much as
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:02.720]   we used to and email has failed us as a way of communicating I think that we email is fed
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:09.120]   truly federated cross-platform interoperable and everybody hates it so it feels like there
[00:26:09.120 --> 00:26:13.440]   should be something. In fact one of the most interesting areas for a new apps has been a new
[00:26:13.440 --> 00:26:20.480]   approach to email it glomming the messaging interface on top of email because we do like
[00:26:20.480 --> 00:26:25.680]   messaging so something about messaging that fits the way we communicate and more and more so I
[00:26:25.680 --> 00:26:30.960]   remember in the early days of text messaging in the US nobody text messages because you didn't
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:37.040]   have a smartphone so you'd have to press you know 449 yeah and then and then you couldn't
[00:26:37.040 --> 00:26:43.840]   message across planet across carriers very well and I remember seeing TV shows in England where
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:48.640]   they'd say you know SMS us your vote and it was huge everybody was doing it they were sending
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:53.760]   billions of messages a week and it was not exist in the United States and it just and it was
[00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:59.040]   thanks to Apple I think the iPhone in 2007 changed everything and now we text messages
[00:26:59.040 --> 00:27:03.760]   as much as anybody did. All right we're gonna take a break come back with more ome malak is here from
[00:27:03.760 --> 00:27:13.280]   om.co one of the great great observers of the tech industry also from Chennai India visiting us
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:19.520]   via Skype and that's the amazing thing you're literally on the other side of the world and we
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:26.560]   got a great image of Jill Duffy from PC magazine it's the middle of the night but hey don't hold
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:31.520]   that against us thank you for being here and sitting in studio with me here in McCracken who
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:35.840]   actually had probably the biggest ordeal because you got to go through traffic to get here in meat
[00:27:35.840 --> 00:27:41.760]   space terrible idea meat space our show today brought to you by go to meeting the powerfully
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:46.320]   simple way to meet with co-workers and clients from the convenience of your computer your smartphone
[00:27:46.320 --> 00:27:53.520]   your tablet no one wants to commute across the bridge through outside lands drive through

[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:15.680]   A lot of folks in Vegas over the last 10 days for Black Hat and Defcon and we talked a little bit
[00:29:15.680 --> 00:29:21.120]   with Steve Gibson yesterday on the new screensavers about some of the revelations. Of course a lot
[00:29:21.120 --> 00:29:26.320]   of this was released ahead of time the things like the car hackings the G-packing and the Tesla
[00:29:26.320 --> 00:29:33.120]   hackings and so forth and we were hoping to learn more at these conferences and this year we did not
[00:29:33.120 --> 00:29:39.840]   not much more from Charlie Miller about the G-packing I mean everything we learned about in the Wired
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:50.560]   article is you know true but not much more stage fright which was kind of revealed beforehand
[00:29:50.560 --> 00:29:55.040]   there's still no proof of concept code because nobody wants to help hackers which is good
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:30:00.720]   stage fright is the android vulnerability that takes advantage of the media player in android
[00:30:00.720 --> 00:30:06.960]   called stage fright. Zimperium which is the group that discovered the stage fright virus has released
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:11.520]   a detection tool although Steve said if you install that on android you should also install look
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:19.360]   out's detection tool and you'll get a second opinion I put it on my up-to-date late model brand new
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:26.000]   Google phone the Nexus 6 running Google Fi and I'm vulnerable so if I'm vulnerable we're all
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   screwed because I mean what about somebody with a really old phone there's not going to be any
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:39.360]   update although LG Samsung and Google have all agreed to start a monthly update cycle that's
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:45.360]   probably an improvement. Amazing it took this many years for them to do that. There are attacks in
[00:30:45.360 --> 00:30:50.080]   the wild stage fright attacks in the wild although I don't know how dangerous they are. Google has
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:56.560]   pointed out that because it is using address space relocation in all versions of android since
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:31:02.800]   jellybean that it's not really a issue of somebody getting control of your phone on those more
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:10.480]   recent versions of android but there are literally something like 800 or 900 million android phones
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:17.040]   that are vulnerable to this. We also learned that hackers can remotely steal fingerprints from android
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:24.720]   phones. That's a little bit scary. Have you looked into how this works? This was announced at Black Hat
[00:31:24.720 --> 00:31:33.120]   on Wednesday by FireEye. Yeah apparently I mean on an iPhone your fingerprint is encrypted and it
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:40.000]   stored in this walled off part of the phone. I assume that the same was true with android. I thought so
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.840]   but apparently not. Apparently not and of course on android different manufacturers are implementing
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:51.440]   fingerprint scanning in different ways so there is not one company in charge of making it safe.
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:58.720]   The attack was confirmed on the HTC One Max and Samsung's Galaxy S5 a hacker could without your
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:05.040]   knowledge acquire the fingerprint images from the device. The sensor is not locked down.
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:12.480]   It doesn't even require root privileges. So that's bad news.
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:23.440]   You find a 1997 phone. You know just commander Adamo is right with the Galactica. Everything
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:31.040]   should be wired and old and then we'd all be safe. That's what people love watching your show.
[00:32:31.600 --> 00:32:35.360]   I didn't say oh what did I ever do to you?
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:45.600]   No it's what I'm I missed it. It's comes from love. You feel love there's deep. Yes absolutely.
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:58.320]   Let's see. Did you see the GOP debate? By the way the highest rated cable news show of all time.
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:04.400]   That predation huh? Cardations have nothing on our
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:09.120]   Oh yeah no no this is better than screw cardashions. We've got Donald Trump.
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:12.640]   Were they talking about it in India Jill?
[00:33:12.640 --> 00:33:21.600]   You know I saw some of my US friends commenting about the debates obviously on Facebook. I didn't
[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:28.000]   watch them live obviously I kind of read some of the recaps. I think the most interesting thing
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:34.160]   from the international perspective is to see how early these debates start in the United States.
[00:33:34.160 --> 00:33:38.640]   So there was there was 18 months for the old to the election. There was like some go back in
[00:33:38.640 --> 00:33:46.000]   Canada because the the candidates started campaigning. It was something like 15 weeks before the election
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.720]   and people were out it was like you know the holiday decorations came up before Halloween or
[00:33:50.720 --> 00:33:56.880]   so it was like people were outraged and then you look at what what happens in the US and it's
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:01.440]   it's just so crazy. You know if you're going to spend a billion and a half dollars to get elected
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:06.800]   president you got to start early. It's not easy to off to you know off put that all that money.
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:15.600]   Speaking of India Google is planning to bring Android one back in India with a sub-50 dollar
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:23.200]   device. This is part of the problem. It's funny because as the same simultaneously is a stage
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:27.920]   right story you see stories like this and this is part of the problem that Google has which is
[00:34:27.920 --> 00:34:32.640]   that a lot of these very low-cost phones just are never going to get updated and there's no way
[00:34:32.640 --> 00:34:40.400]   to update them and yet this is I think important to everybody to get get people online and using
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:44.640]   computers. And the idea with Android one is to do a phone which is really cheap but is also a
[00:34:44.640 --> 00:34:51.360]   respectable phone right for the price and one where you know it's not going to be based on an
[00:34:51.360 --> 00:34:56.400]   ancient version of Android and that stands a chance of getting updated. It's not ancient now but it
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:35:00.480]   will be ancient in four years and then you know the same you have the same problem. Although I think
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:05.760]   Google is moving a lot of the system components out of the out of the system and into the play
[00:35:05.760 --> 00:35:10.000]   store so they can precisely so they can they're trying to do current versions of Android which
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:15.760]   are small enough to run on a phone that can be sold for a price like 50 bucks. It's interesting
[00:35:15.760 --> 00:35:20.560]   you've Verizon announced that they're joining this week that they're joining T-Mobile and eliminating
[00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:25.280]   subsidies for smartphones. So all of a sudden people in the United States are seeing what that
[00:35:25.280 --> 00:35:31.600]   smartphone actually costs. It's not 200 bucks and iPhone 700 bucks. Many of the top of the line
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:37.840]   phones are between six and eight hundred dollars and I think that's going to add pressure to reduce
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:43.200]   phone costs here in the States even. In fact the new phones that we're seeing the Moto X, the Moto
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:47.760]   G, the OnePlus 2 are all sub-500 dollars. I think that's telling isn't it?
[00:35:47.760 --> 00:35:55.280]   Any kind. Yeah I mean it's more bad news for everybody except Apple essentially. I think Apple
[00:35:55.280 --> 00:36:00.480]   will still be able to sell a flagship phone at a flagship price but I think it'll be a challenge
[00:36:00.480 --> 00:36:08.240]   for Samsung and if your HTC or LG or anybody else it gets tougher and tougher to do a 700
[00:36:08.240 --> 00:36:14.560]   dollar phone and get people to buy it. It'll still work as long as there's a payment plan system.
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:18.720]   So part of the issue is that people have decided how much they're willing to pay
[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:24.320]   for a mobile phone monthly. They've kind of been anchored into a price and that price can be
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:31.680]   anywhere from about I'd say $45.50 to about $100. And if you're saying okay upfront I need to pay
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:38.080]   $800 now and enroll in a plan people are not going to go for that but if you can work out the numbers
[00:36:38.080 --> 00:36:42.640]   one way or another to make it a monthly payment based on what people are ready to pay I think
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:49.200]   it can still work. With Verizon it's pretty confusing because some people are going to end up paying more
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:53.120]   under the new plan and some are going to end up paying less. And people with existing Verizon
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:57.520]   accounts are not going to get any change at all. There's going to be very confusing. I mean in theory
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:03.840]   this could be really good if it involves the price you pay for your service no longer have the price
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:09.680]   that Verizon needs to pay to pay for all those phones is subsidizing in there because historically
[00:37:09.680 --> 00:37:16.400]   you've gotten a subsidized phone and you've paid a price with the subsidy built in but you've
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:21.840]   continued paying that subsidized service charge even after you've paid off your phone. And it's
[00:37:21.840 --> 00:37:26.240]   become pure profit for Verizon. Is this pressure from T-Mobile wise Verizon even?
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:32.160]   This is clearly T-Mobile's strategy working. I think they're changing the game they're making
[00:37:32.160 --> 00:37:40.560]   things work more effectively in favor of the consumer and using that as an advantage to steal
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:47.360]   market share away from Verizon. So definitely there is an upside to the whole thing right now.
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:55.120]   You know the one thing I wonder like where the future is headed is it's the sticker you have
[00:37:56.480 --> 00:38:06.240]   on your laptop. The Google Fi sticker the project Fi. I think as we speak less and less on the phone
[00:38:06.240 --> 00:38:11.520]   the data becomes more important. You're going to start to see many more experiments like Google Fi
[00:38:11.520 --> 00:38:18.000]   start to emerge and that's where the next battleground is going to be. So that's why also
[00:38:18.800 --> 00:38:27.440]   I look at what T-Mobile and Verizon is doing is actually preparing for the reality of
[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:34.240]   tomorrow not today. I think tomorrow I mean if I can get you know $100 for
[00:38:34.240 --> 00:38:41.040]   data only on my phone that's all I want I'll be very happy. Like I would be much more happier
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:44.720]   getting a phone number for SMS and data and because-
[00:38:44.720 --> 00:38:49.840]   I never use the phone anymore. Yeah and whenever I do I'm actually calling through Viber or
[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:56.960]   WhatsApp or sometimes even from Skype and even you know Google Voice. So it just is not that
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:39:03.280]   important. The phone part of the phone is not important at all and the text messaging is very
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:09.840]   important and even that is becoming less relevant what we need is just a data connection. I think
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:15.600]   that's why it makes sense for the guys to get away from you know subsidizing the phone itself.
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:22.240]   When fact T-Mobile the most popular plan among the geeks is a kind of a hidden pay as you go plan
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:29.680]   on the T-Mobile webpage $30 a month for unlimited text and data and only 100 minutes of calling a
[00:39:29.680 --> 00:39:35.360]   month and I tell you what I'd easily do that for me. I never do more than 100 minutes.
[00:39:35.360 --> 00:39:41.360]   Google Fi is $20 for the texting and by the way I'm holding the phone phone up because I
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:51.920]   suckered Lee fell for it. $20 a month for texting and phone unlimited and then you pay $10 a gigabyte
[00:39:51.920 --> 00:39:57.040]   for data. So that's the only upside for Google is the more data you use the more you'll pay.
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:02.320]   But it and it uses the T-Mobile network and the Sprint network and Wi-Fi if you happen to have
[00:40:02.320 --> 00:40:09.280]   Wi-Fi handy. I don't really understand though this is not for somebody who's using the $30
[00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:16.640]   T-Mobile plan this is not a savings. So I'm not sure what again I don't feel like Google's strategy
[00:40:16.640 --> 00:40:23.040]   is clear maybe I'm missing the boat. I'm like 15 gigabytes and I'm not paying $150 for that.
[00:40:23.040 --> 00:40:31.760]   Yeah go ahead go. I'm intrigued by the Google Fi. I mean now that I'm a civilian I'm still
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:37.840]   waiting for my phone to show up so I haven't tried it. But I look at that and I just like this is
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:44.240]   interesting because I can get 3G when I'm traveling worldwide which is great and it also
[00:40:44.240 --> 00:40:54.000]   allows me to not worry about which platform I'm on T-Mobile or Sprint you know not exactly the
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:41:00.960]   rock solid networks but good enough and Wi-Fi I think this is where we are headed like maybe not
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:07.200]   this exact model but this is where we are headed where we see all the carriers getting abstracted
[00:41:07.200 --> 00:41:15.360]   on our devices. I think it's not as crazy to think about the future you know service like device
[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:21.440]   coming with okay you turn it on you don't have to think about who you are signing up with that
[00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:29.120]   just is the network and in the background stuff happens. I think this is but not today but in
[00:41:29.120 --> 00:41:35.120]   the future you know you look at what companies like Comcast and Cox and Time Warner are doing
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:41.280]   they're setting up their own massive Wi-Fi cloud everywhere right so you suddenly start to think
[00:41:41.280 --> 00:41:47.360]   it's like what is the idea of connectivity going forward it's not the way we've always
[00:41:47.360 --> 00:41:55.200]   assumed it is right so which is just a phone sign up with the phone company give them $150 a month
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:42:00.960]   and basically you're locked into a three-year contract it makes no sense anymore.
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:05.600]   It's also driving the size of the phones if you're not making phone calls on it you want the biggest
[00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:10.560]   screen you can get because that's for better for typing and surfing and computing which is what
[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:17.600]   you're doing mostly with phones these days so Motorola's new phones are big Samsung's new phones are big
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:23.680]   everybody's got and this phone is ridiculous it's six inches it.
[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:35.360]   I have iPhone 6 Plus and I have a 1999 version Samsung flip phone I pay $29 to Verizon for
[00:42:35.360 --> 00:42:40.960]   my flip phone to make phone calls that's it. Oh that's funny. Because it's impossible to make
[00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:47.040]   phone calls on these big phones just like you have to have headphones and it just is too complex
[00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:52.080]   you can't you know you have to do too many things while you are using the phone so it just is better to
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:43:00.160]   get a simple voice phone. I like the comfort of a flip phone it actually sounds cleaner and
[00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:05.680]   clearer and there's no GPS chip on the damn thing so it's all good. It's a burner.
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:09.440]   Yeah. Jill did you get a new phone when you moved to India what did you do?
[00:43:09.440 --> 00:43:15.440]   No I just got a SIM card so I had an unlocked phone and I got a local SIM card and that seems to
[00:43:15.440 --> 00:43:20.400]   work fine for me but the majority of phone calls I take actually this is my setup so I have a headset
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:26.560]   and I use my computer I use Google Voice often so when I have meetings with companies in the
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:31.280]   United States I always want to give them a US phone number so I still use Google Voice which
[00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:38.560]   is not the best system I have to say like that is oh yeah oh yeah. Why didn't realize it.
[00:43:38.560 --> 00:43:43.760]   I used to live in the UK too and I used it a lot there for the same reason you know to give people
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:50.960]   a US phone number but the convenience of just having a US phone number is huge and you don't
[00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:55.680]   have to pay for it with Google Voice the way that you could with Skype to get a phone number but my
[00:43:55.680 --> 00:44:00.800]   setup is you know I'm usually at my desk my phone calls are always planned I don't take impromptu
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:05.280]   phone calls nobody ever calls. I don't either. Just to say it's somebody rings my phone I ignore
[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:14.320]   it's weird. Right so a phone like a plan. It's like a meeting so I'm usually in my home I have my
[00:44:14.320 --> 00:44:20.560]   setup I have my headphones I'm often recording the call and that's what phone means to me now.
[00:44:21.280 --> 00:44:26.880]   But I'm not doing any reporting and I notice I still go to my desktop computer put on my headset
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:31.440]   before I make a phone call because it's just more comfortable. I don't want to be holding the phone
[00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:36.880]   and this is only so this is only useful for emergencies basically and I only answer the phone if it's
[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:41.200]   somebody if it's my friends or family mostly just family because I don't have any friends.
[00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:46.400]   Emily over the age of seven to eight a lot of cases. Yeah right it's an emergency thing right
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:51.440]   because they're me and my kids aren't making phone calls they're texting me. But it behaves
[00:44:51.440 --> 00:44:55.440]   your thing. Yeah so speaking of emergencies I have a I have an article coming out tomorrow
[00:44:55.440 --> 00:45:01.840]   Monday morning on PCMag about putting emergency contact information into your phone. So this was
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:07.520]   something as I started to look at the different phones and the way to do it. Apple is definitely
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:12.560]   ahead it has the easiest system so don't they have an app for that. It's in the health app.
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:17.840]   So you know there's every phone has to allow you to make an emergency call from the lock screen.
[00:45:17.840 --> 00:45:22.960]   Right. This is a requirement in the US. So Apple has a little button that has medical
[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:30.080]   information on it and I really like highly highly recommend everybody who has an apple device use
[00:45:30.080 --> 00:45:35.600]   that if you have kids if kids are going away to college soon absolutely make sure they set it
[00:45:35.600 --> 00:45:41.200]   up it takes about two minutes to do but it has your name your medical information as much as you
[00:45:41.200 --> 00:45:47.040]   want to put in there so allergies blood type and as many contacts as you want to list as your
[00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:51.600]   emergency ID people. So it's important not only for us to set it up but also for other people to
[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:55.520]   know how to access it. And does that show up if you make an emergency call from the lock screen?
[00:45:55.520 --> 00:46:02.640]   So when you swipe from a lock screen and you hit emergency call you then get a dialer and you also
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:06.960]   see on the bottom a little thing that says medical ID and that's where you pull it up. So that's if
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:12.240]   I have a heart attack and I fall to the ground and somebody grabs my phone they can actually call
[00:46:12.240 --> 00:46:18.240]   for help and have that information right there. Hopefully they know about that. So it's not as
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:24.400]   good because there's a lot of apps that offer this it's not on all phones there are some phones
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:28.800]   that have it in the settings but it's you know it's fragmented it's Android. But the trick with
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:33.600]   Android is to find an app that offers it with a widget from the lock screen. So that's what I
[00:46:33.600 --> 00:46:40.240]   need. Yeah. And they're kind of a lot of them are buggy some of them mess with your alarm apparently.
[00:46:40.240 --> 00:46:47.520]   And then I looked at BlackBerry and Windows phone and they're not as good either. I think there's an
[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:54.160]   app for for both of those that allow you to put any message you want on your lock screen. So again
[00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:59.920]   I recommend to people put your emergency contact info there. Jason Howell if you found anything Jason
[00:46:59.920 --> 00:47:04.960]   not only is my producer but the host of all about Android and Android App Arena have you found any
[00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:11.040]   good emergency information apps for Android are you aware of this? Specifically I mean I know
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:14.880]   I know that there are plenty of apps that do that on the lock screen like Jill's talking about.
[00:47:14.880 --> 00:47:21.840]   The problem there is that lollipop and beyond there are no more lock screen widgets. They basically
[00:47:21.840 --> 00:47:28.560]   got rid of that and now it's the notification stream there by default. So that helps you if you're
[00:47:28.560 --> 00:47:34.320]   I mean and plenty of people are on older versions of Android as we know well not too well.
[00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:42.160]   But yeah current versions lollipop and more recent don't have that ability. So the irony built in
[00:47:42.160 --> 00:47:46.240]   by the phone it absolutely should. The irony is I don't know if everybody knows this is on the
[00:47:46.240 --> 00:47:53.840]   Apple lock screen. Yeah I guess emergency first responders probably have been told this right?
[00:47:54.640 --> 00:48:01.760]   I would hope so. The other life hack way to do it is to create a note in any note taking app make
[00:48:01.760 --> 00:48:06.400]   sure it's centered. Type your emergency contact info there take a screenshot of it make that your
[00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:12.640]   wallpaper. Oh yeah that's a good one. But then it's always there. Yeah I have a friend who is
[00:48:12.640 --> 00:48:20.000]   EMT. I am going to ask him do you know about this? Is this common knowledge among first responders?
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.920]   How about in the chat room? Any first responders in the chat room? How come I bet you this is the
[00:48:23.920 --> 00:48:30.720]   kind of thing? I remember dimly apple announcing this probably WWDC or one of the conferences.
[00:48:30.720 --> 00:48:35.920]   But I know I forgot that this is even in there. I'm glad you wrote that article Jill.
[00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:42.640]   I didn't know it was on there. You didn't either. No see. And Omenai who are old men.
[00:48:42.640 --> 00:48:49.360]   No I definitely need that. Well you've actually in all seriousness you've had a heart attack.
[00:48:49.360 --> 00:48:55.200]   Yeah I'm glad I actually came on the show. I learned something new. How did you when you had your
[00:48:55.200 --> 00:49:00.720]   heart attack was that in public? Where did that? I was at home and you knew that you were having
[00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:09.840]   a heart attack? Hell no. I thought I was having a heart bone. Yeah. Like I had a certain specific
[00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:15.120]   kind of food tonight before and I assume I was having heart bone because of that and
[00:49:16.560 --> 00:49:22.240]   you know I figured out later thanks to a friend who did the diagnosed. You know who diagnosed me
[00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:29.360]   while I was telling him on the phone how I felt. I guess his father was a cardiologist and
[00:49:29.360 --> 00:49:36.320]   he had paid attention to what was going on and he came over and took me to the hospital. That's
[00:49:36.320 --> 00:49:42.400]   awesome. Yeah. That is one thing my EMT friend has told me with both stroke and heart attack
[00:49:43.360 --> 00:49:50.080]   getting a person in the hospital is of as quickly as possible is hugely important. In fact I remember
[00:49:50.080 --> 00:49:54.640]   reading a New York Times article last month that they've had something like 18% improvement
[00:49:54.640 --> 00:50:00.080]   in heart attack recovery not through any medical procedure but because they got people to the
[00:50:00.080 --> 00:50:05.600]   hospital faster. That you know they have EKGs and the ambulance now they can send that to the
[00:50:05.600 --> 00:50:11.600]   hospital before you get there so that they're ready to when you arrive. The other thing he told me
[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:15.440]   and this is important for everybody to hear is if you think you're having a heart attack
[00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:20.960]   you know don't drive yourself get to the hospital. He said don't be embarrassed.
[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:27.520]   We're very used to this people coming in with gas and anxiety and thinking it's a heart attack.
[00:50:27.520 --> 00:50:32.000]   It's not a shameful thing. We're very used to it and we'd far prefer you came in
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:37.280]   then that you ignored the symptoms because it can really save your life.
[00:50:38.640 --> 00:50:41.760]   He told me I can't remember what it was but every minute there's a certain percentage
[00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:44.960]   every minute that goes by a certain percentage less
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:52.800]   life expectancy or something. I can't remember the exact thing. Anyway we'll move on but
[00:50:52.800 --> 00:50:56.400]   I'm glad you made it home and I'm glad you have a good friend who was there to
[00:50:56.400 --> 00:51:03.840]   me too. Get you to them. I'm pretty happy about that. Yeah yeah more to come in a bit.
[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:10.400]   O'Malley is back baby. You're not you so you said you don't travel in the summer because
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:16.720]   that's the amateurs do that. Yeah I mean is that true? Oh it is plus it's hot.
[00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:23.840]   Also the airport is so crowded. Yeah so where are you going next and when?
[00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:28.000]   Because I'd like to raid your apartment. It looks like you got some good stuff in there.
[00:51:28.000 --> 00:51:30.400]   Yeah you can try it.
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:36.480]   Oh you have some booby traps? You got it you got it kind of you know.
[00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:41.600]   You got some secret stuff? So like I'm going to have videos of you coming in on
[00:51:41.600 --> 00:51:45.840]   drop damn. I mean that's just like 10 million views right there.
[00:51:45.840 --> 00:51:53.680]   You'll never believe Leo broke into my apartment and you'll never believe what happened next.
[00:51:53.680 --> 00:52:00.800]   I will be the headline. It's a hit. That's a million views right there. That's right.
[00:52:00.800 --> 00:52:06.720]   Also visiting us who knew a couple of months ago she moved to India. We're so glad though
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:11.360]   that you would be on the show with us even though it's early early morning Jill Duffy from PC Mag.
[00:52:11.360 --> 00:52:15.840]   Great to have you. I don't know if you can hear but I'm starting to hear some birds chirping out
[00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:19.360]   so it's so carer walking. The morning is come.
[00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:29.280]   Morning has broken. Eric Krakke and I are going to do a little performance here.
[00:52:29.280 --> 00:52:35.680]   The Technologizer for Fast Company dot com. Harry McCracken. Something got mad at me the
[00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:39.600]   last time you were on he said he's not the technologizer anymore. No I will always be.
[00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:43.440]   You're always going to be. I'm honored you remember. You're forever the technologizer.
[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:46.640]   I write at Fast Company. So yeah not at Technologizer dot com.
[00:52:46.640 --> 00:52:49.440]   Go to Technologizer dot com to read my new stuff. Go to Fast Company.
[00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:51.680]   Do you still do you maintain that? You put stuff.
[00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:54.880]   Everybody wants to know great while I'll write on Technologizer but it's been several months.
[00:52:54.880 --> 00:52:59.760]   It's so sad what's happened to blogging. I'm proud of OAM for maintaining keeping this alive.
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:04.640]   This is an old man thing. It's for old men. No blog for old men.
[00:53:04.640 --> 00:53:11.840]   OAM dot co which is by the way one of the most beautiful designs ever. It's just simple and clean.
[00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:14.080]   And yes. What?
[00:53:14.080 --> 00:53:18.320]   There's no design. There's no design. There's no design.
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:21.440]   It's quite so good. It's good. No ads.
[00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:26.000]   No ads either. Well let's we'll talk about ads in just a second.
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:31.040]   There's a lot of news in the online advertising world.
[00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:36.160]   Our show today brought to you by Braintree. If you're a mobile app developer you know that
[00:53:36.160 --> 00:53:40.240]   and you want to have payments in there. You know that of course you're good. You could write it
[00:53:40.240 --> 00:53:46.960]   yourself but don't. Like one of the biggest mistakes people make is doing their own e-commerce,
[00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:54.240]   their own crypto, their own security. Braintree makes it so easy. 10 lines of code.
[00:53:54.240 --> 00:53:59.440]   It's funny. Who was I talking to? A mobile app developer who said that was the phrase that got
[00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:07.200]   me 10 lines of code and you can accept Apple Pay. You can accept credit cards, Venmo, PayPal.
[00:54:07.200 --> 00:54:11.840]   All kinds of payments. Easy as pie. You can even accept Bitcoin if you want in your app.
[00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:18.240]   We talked to the CTO of Braintree. Great guy Juan Benitez about the feedback, the kind of
[00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:24.720]   feedback he's getting from developers about Braintree. Listen, when we talk to iOS engineers they get
[00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:31.680]   really excited by how fast news is to have Apple Pay through Braintree. Just a ton of feedback from
[00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:36.160]   Android developers saying, "Wow great. Now I can get Android Pay." Then you see people really
[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:40.960]   kind of responding and saying, "Wow I can do more than one of these through one integration,
[00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:45.440]   one SDK and one report too. Wow that's going to make my finance guys happy."
[00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:50.640]   Fast payout, superior fraud protection, great customer service. It's easy for the developer
[00:54:50.640 --> 00:54:56.880]   and as he said it makes the finance guys and gals really happy. Now just look at who uses Braintree
[00:54:56.880 --> 00:55:01.520]   and I'll get an idea of how great this is. Airbnb uses it so does hotels tonight.
[00:55:01.520 --> 00:55:07.840]   Uber uses it. If any, if there were one company where mobile payment experience is
[00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:16.800]   premieres is the entire story it would be Uber. Yes that's Braintree. So does Lyft. Lyft uses it too.
[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:20.320]   In fact, GitHub started with Braintree and they're still doing it from your first dollar to your
[00:55:20.320 --> 00:55:25.040]   billionth there is no better way. You're going to like it. I think Uber is using that one touch
[00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:31.040]   product that makes it so easy. A full stack payment solution ready for you. You can try it in the
[00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:37.200]   sandbox and as a little sweetener if you go to braintreepayments.com/twit we're going to get you
[00:55:37.200 --> 00:55:45.920]   your first fifty thousand dollars in transactions fee free. Braintreepayments.com/twit
[00:55:45.920 --> 00:55:52.400]   tell your boss whoever makes the decisions that's the product. Braintree. I'm just looking
[00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:58.080]   at emergency information. Here's an Android. You fill it out. Yeah you know there isn't really any
[00:55:58.080 --> 00:56:04.160]   good. Jill did you make a recommendation in your article for something? Yeah there's one.
[00:56:04.160 --> 00:56:08.880]   Ice is usually the word right. Ice is the case of emergency. If you search for ice there's usually
[00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:13.360]   a few that come up. I don't remember off the top of my head but there's one that costs about
[00:56:13.360 --> 00:56:19.920]   $3.99 that was widely used but seemed to cause bugs for some people. From app event. But again if
[00:56:19.920 --> 00:56:24.320]   it's offered in your settings and everybody should check with their particular phone and their
[00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:29.520]   particular carrier if it's offered in your settings that's really where you want to be implementing it.
[00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:34.480]   Awesome. You know this is something that Google could put into Android and probably should.
[00:56:34.480 --> 00:56:37.920]   Some people in chat were saying that it's in there in settings but I don't know if that's
[00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:43.120]   Google by default or if it's like I have a Samsung phone. I think that's phone specific. I don't see
[00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:51.120]   it on my next six. Yeah I was looking at mine as well. I couldn't find it. I guess we haven't done
[00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:57.680]   the Apple stories. I probably wouldn't be a twit without some Apple stories right? Apple apparently
[00:56:57.680 --> 00:57:04.960]   according to John Patchkowski king of the Apple Lake. He's rapidly eclipsing Mark Gurman now that
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:09.520]   patch. I'm going to call him Patch. I don't know if anybody else calls him Patch. Good old Patch.
[00:57:09.520 --> 00:57:15.600]   Now the patch is at Buzzfeed. He's still getting the scoops. He says Apple's fall iPhone event will be
[00:57:15.600 --> 00:57:23.040]   September 9th. Well the actual story says the week of the seventh probably the ninth. Yeah
[00:57:23.600 --> 00:57:29.440]   sometime in the seventh could be the eighth could be the ninth. Apple had the usually holds its
[00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:35.360]   events on Tuesdays which would make the eighth if you ask me the more likely of the two. We don't
[00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:42.560]   know what they will announce but it is September so it likely is a new iPhone right? He says iPhones
[00:57:42.560 --> 00:57:48.640]   iPads and Apple TV. Wow so the whole shebang. It's a no October event. Just get it all done with
[00:57:48.640 --> 00:57:54.080]   maybe just one event this time. Apple TV is one of those things Patchkowski has been talking about
[00:57:54.080 --> 00:58:00.720]   since June since WWDC. Supposedly it was going to be announced at the worldwide developers conference
[00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:07.280]   Apple backed out probably because they couldn't make the deals with the networks and the local TV
[00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:11.440]   stations they wanted to make. I don't know if they've made those deals and maybe that they finally
[00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:18.160]   just said oh screw it. If we don't release this now we'll never release it and they'll hope the deals
[00:58:18.160 --> 00:58:24.640]   will come. Apple would like for the Apple TV to be the ultimate cord cutting device. Will it be
[00:58:24.640 --> 00:58:31.280]   home? I hope so. You like it? You know I kind of I don't have a television so
[00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:38.720]   you have to cord cut. You look in the back I haven't had a TV since 2008. We had a website called
[00:58:38.720 --> 00:58:45.280]   new TV which is all around the idea of online television, cord cutting and everything so I said
[00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:51.120]   I should live the lifestyle if I'm going to start a blog about that. And Yaikou Ruckers was the
[00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:58.160]   was your one of your great reporters. He's now a variety. Yeah. One of the more amazing people I
[00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:06.240]   had a chance to work with and and you know Liz Gaines who she was the founding editor of that site
[00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:14.960]   and she's at recode. Yeah I think she's doing some research now at Stanford. Oh really oh that's
[00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:22.160]   right. That's right she's retired to become a student. Yeah and it's great to not have television
[00:59:22.160 --> 00:59:30.720]   and so you can actually experience the whole no you know no screen kind of life but when I go and
[00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:37.200]   see some of my friends who are using Apple TV you can see the potential. I actually really like
[00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:43.280]   Chromecast. I think Chromecast is. I do too. It's a very well made product from Google which
[00:59:43.840 --> 00:59:49.520]   doesn't do too many products finished and you know completed like the way they've done the
[00:59:49.520 --> 00:59:55.840]   Chromecast. I also like Roku. I think Roku is an interesting little company they keep going and
[00:59:55.840 --> 01:00:02.080]   I like the whole category for say because I believe that you know I think the whole idea of
[01:00:02.080 --> 01:00:10.080]   television the way it was is just makes no sense anymore. I think you know I felt that way in 2008
[01:00:10.080 --> 01:00:15.840]   and I still feel it. You know it's finally last one week you're beginning to see everybody talk
[01:00:15.840 --> 01:00:22.640]   about the reality of quad cutting. So sometimes you know it takes five to seven years for reality
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:30.560]   to to happen but it's been fun like I like the iPad is a great viewing device from my standpoint.
[01:00:30.560 --> 01:00:37.760]   I watch MLB on it. I watch cricket on it. I watch NBA on it. So it's like I watch it's like a very
[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:44.960]   small television but the Apple TV if it comes out it will actually push more and more people to
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:52.800]   think about just using that as an interface for consuming content. This week Wall Street to cut
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:58.480]   60 billion dollars off the value of major media companies based on this kind of cord cutting
[01:00:58.480 --> 01:01:06.800]   fear. Who was it was talking at a conference and said. ESPN. It was ESPN. Their revenues are down
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:12.240]   for the first time. It sounds like the TV businesses finally acknowledging that card cutting might
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:17.600]   impact their business over the long term which until recently they were in real first denial mode
[01:01:17.600 --> 01:01:23.360]   about. Well it's confusing because you read these statistics ESPN which is traditionally the
[01:01:23.360 --> 01:01:30.160]   cable channel people will pay the most for. They make the most money something like 625 per subscriber
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:34.560]   for them to make less is a big deal. But then you also hear statistics people are watching
[01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:41.120]   more broadcast television than ever before. So I don't know which is true but obviously media
[01:01:41.120 --> 01:01:51.920]   stocks really took a hit Walt Disney 21st century Fox and a Viacom although the CEO of cable vision
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:57.520]   said not so fast. It's not it's not that bad. We don't see he told the Wall Street Journal.
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:04.240]   We don't see a landslide of corn cutting in the near term James Dolan. Now of course he's talking
[01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:09.680]   to investors. So he's trying to shore up the stock. He says I don't think the sky is falling quite yet.
[01:02:09.680 --> 01:02:18.880]   Nevertheless cable vision shares fell 2.7% on Friday and 5% over the two days.
[01:02:18.880 --> 01:02:30.000]   Alleur the key way to think about any of these changes is we are beginning to see
[01:02:30.800 --> 01:02:37.520]   a whole generation think about television not as television but something on demand.
[01:02:37.520 --> 01:02:44.240]   And then you have a generation behind them who think of video only in terms of devices
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:48.480]   which they can hold in their hand and they can touch. I think that's exactly right.
[01:02:48.480 --> 01:02:55.440]   And so 10 years forward you know these guys may you know stem the losses for a little while
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:03:01.520]   do some financial engineering. 10 years down the line the behavior of the consumer is very
[01:03:01.520 --> 01:03:06.000]   different. That's when you know it's not caught cutting. It just is a different behavior.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:12.080]   You're not watching television at all. Yeah. And I think this whole notion that you know
[01:03:12.080 --> 01:03:18.000]   life sports is going to save their bacon and life events. I don't know. We don't know like what
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:25.840]   the consumers of tomorrow are going to you know adapt to these things or not. Like I don't know.
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:34.080]   I am really interested in trying to figure out how people consume television in the next five years
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:39.280]   to actually make a reasonable call on like what the future looks like. But this one thing is for
[01:03:39.280 --> 01:03:46.800]   sure the way things work that's gone. Like that in a 60 billion or 600 billion in their market
[01:03:46.800 --> 01:03:53.280]   cap that just irrelevant. These companies have been sitting and doing absolutely nothing.
[01:03:53.280 --> 01:03:58.160]   And that's why they are beginning to suffer. Well cable companies first and then networks nest.
[01:03:58.160 --> 01:04:02.160]   I mean I think the networks are in denial about the fact that people aren't even watching TV.
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:08.320]   Go ahead John sir. Yeah there's been some really great stories about MLB which was one of the first
[01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:14.480]   leaders I think in getting to the online space. So the MLB TV people made your league baseball.
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:19.200]   We're really trying to offer some kind of online experience early on. They knew that they had
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:23.520]   a worldwide audience of people watching baseball who couldn't always watch it because they didn't
[01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:30.880]   have US network television. So in the early days of MLB TV it was awful. It was like watching a
[01:04:30.880 --> 01:04:35.920]   pixelated video game you know frame by frame it was terrible. But they stuck with it and they
[01:04:35.920 --> 01:04:43.280]   developed it out. And we're an MLB household so we use it quite frequently. But three in the morning
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:49.920]   unfortunately. Yeah we have actually I have to I have to start the game because I'm allowed to see
[01:04:49.920 --> 01:04:57.200]   the final scores. Ah so I'm in charge of starting the game. I see. But yeah after the fact. But
[01:04:57.200 --> 01:05:04.640]   what happened was HBO hired some people from MLB who had worked on that product. HBO now was based
[01:05:04.640 --> 01:05:10.320]   on MLB. Now exactly. And they said we really need somebody who has expertise and nobody had any
[01:05:10.320 --> 01:05:16.640]   expertise including their own giant in-house very expensive HBO go team up there in Seattle.
[01:05:16.640 --> 01:05:22.800]   Well left people. So I think and I think HBO has been a huge story this year once they
[01:05:22.800 --> 01:05:29.120]   they offered that a la carte service. That's going to be a real I think it's going to set the tone
[01:05:29.120 --> 01:05:33.360]   for a lot of other channels. ESPN went over the top with sling TV. I think sling has been a big
[01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:36.640]   deal. I think we'll look back at slang as having been really important. Yeah.
[01:05:38.480 --> 01:05:45.280]   Yet I I think the real problem is exactly his own points and I look at I have two kids 23 and 21.
[01:05:45.280 --> 01:05:52.000]   The 23 year old will watch Netflix will watch she'll sit down in front of a TV set. She was not
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:56.880]   she's a court cutter in that sense. She's not watching live programming. She's watching on-demand
[01:05:56.880 --> 01:06:03.200]   programming off the internet. The 21 year old won't do that. He watches YouTube. And that's it.
[01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:08.560]   And I feel like that's really I mean you're missing the boat if you're thinking oh the next thing is
[01:06:08.560 --> 01:06:16.080]   over the top. As I think you nailed it on which is TV watching itself has changed completely and
[01:06:16.080 --> 01:06:20.480]   people are using mobile devices. They're not watching TV. They're consuming content in some
[01:06:20.480 --> 01:06:28.160]   completely different way. I think what it does is it you know it basically all the economics of our
[01:06:29.280 --> 01:06:37.040]   television and entertainment ecosystem is build on mass audience. Right. Right. And we are going into
[01:06:37.040 --> 01:06:45.760]   more you know like fractional audience over a long period of time. And there will be hits and
[01:06:45.760 --> 01:06:52.800]   there will be some people who will do really well with the hits like HBO and True Detective or
[01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:57.920]   Sopranos type of shows. Do you think there's a future for that kind of programming that kind of
[01:06:58.480 --> 01:07:03.360]   event programming? Absolutely. I think great storytelling is great storytelling.
[01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:10.880]   Whether you tell them through you know you tell them as a poem or you tell them as a movie or as a
[01:07:10.880 --> 01:07:18.000]   you know running TV series. Great stories are great story. There will be far the focus has to be
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:24.400]   on finding that interesting thing that people are glued to. But most of the viewing is going to be
[01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:30.800]   fractional. So the economics of the industry changes not from mass audience which is like
[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:38.000]   mass audience put lots of television, charge lots of money and go home. Whereas fractional is
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:44.160]   everything is just you know up for grabs. Maybe we need to be thinking really really hard about
[01:07:44.160 --> 01:07:50.880]   paid content subscription models which are entirely different than what they are today.
[01:07:50.880 --> 01:07:56.560]   I think Netflix works because it is actually an interesting business model not because
[01:07:56.560 --> 01:08:03.600]   it has the best content. It's like they figured out that for ten dollars a month people are okay
[01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:10.000]   putting up with you know a lot of average content as long as they find something to see
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:13.440]   on a daily basis. We don't really care as long as there's
[01:08:13.440 --> 01:08:19.600]   colors and people moving. It doesn't really matter what it is. But think about it this way.
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:26.240]   How much time do you have in your day anymore? Yeah. To watch television. Like let's take what's
[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:31.200]   happening in our society right now. If you don't have full time jobs in the middle class
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:36.560]   people are going to work two, three, four jobs they're going to do right to make ends meet.
[01:08:36.560 --> 01:08:43.040]   They're not watching television. They will watch television within you know all these things they're
[01:08:43.040 --> 01:08:48.960]   doing and finding. We'll have to steal time to entertain ourselves. Does that mean short form
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:55.120]   is going to be more successful? Not like two minute videos definitely but I'm sure you know there will
[01:08:55.120 --> 01:09:00.240]   be like somebody might come up with a new form. It's hard to tell a story. In fact you're seeing
[01:09:00.240 --> 01:09:04.960]   really the opposite when you think about the fact that these HBO shows like Game of Thrones are
[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:11.040]   true detectives really are 30 or 40 hour movies. They're not even two hour movies. They're spread
[01:09:11.040 --> 01:09:17.920]   out but they're a lot of hours. We've gotten better at a long story arc than ever before. We like
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:24.080]   those long stories. How about like a two hour news screen series? It is two hours.
[01:09:24.080 --> 01:09:29.760]   As a matter of fact. Well I feel like it's like half-hour. Good. I like it. Thank you,
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:35.680]   Um Rock on. Uh yeah. You know when you start to look at some of the TV shows that are coming out
[01:09:35.680 --> 01:09:41.440]   exclusive on Vimeo and YouTube. I think they're breaking away from the idea of having a format
[01:09:41.440 --> 01:09:46.240]   at all. They say let us tell the story in the amount of time that we need. So shows like High
[01:09:46.240 --> 01:09:52.160]   Maintenance for example which is on Vimeo. And there's a few others that have very short programs.
[01:09:52.160 --> 01:09:57.440]   I think that's a good experimental way to go but I think we also have to remember that we've been
[01:09:57.440 --> 01:10:04.960]   programmed to consume content in certain blocks. So a half hour show is usually actually somewhere
[01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:10.640]   between 22 and 26 minutes in the US because of commercial breaks. And if you watch on Netflix
[01:10:10.640 --> 01:10:15.440]   right like you'll you'll watch those 22 minutes straight through. And then there's a difference
[01:10:15.440 --> 01:10:20.720]   between an hour long show on network which is usually about 46 minutes and an hour long HBO
[01:10:20.720 --> 01:10:27.280]   show which is actually more like 58, 59 minutes. And I think we're acclimated to watching in those
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:31.440]   breaks and that writers start to get used to writing in those breaks right. So you have
[01:10:31.440 --> 01:10:37.840]   14 minutes until your plot twist and you have eight minutes of resolution. You know what I mean?
[01:10:37.840 --> 01:10:44.080]   So I think we have some forms that are more ingrained in our behavior for consuming media than we
[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:49.920]   realize. And I would say the same thing about movies too. So you know that the movie studios
[01:10:49.920 --> 01:10:53.680]   are pushing for a certain amount of time on a movie because they know that the consumer going to
[01:10:53.680 --> 01:10:58.720]   the theater wants a certain length of an experience to feel like they're getting their money's worth.
[01:10:58.720 --> 01:11:05.120]   So writers are taught to pace their stories based on that block of time that they're given.
[01:11:05.120 --> 01:11:10.960]   So I think some of those issues are going to be harder to overcome in Newbie. I think Newbie
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:17.120]   that helps them a lot. But I think getting used to the idea that we the consumer want to have
[01:11:17.120 --> 01:11:22.080]   certain things happen in our story in the plotting and the pacing just because we've been accustomed
[01:11:22.080 --> 01:11:25.360]   to that's that's the way that a story is. It might even be biological.
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:30.720]   Ira Glass says that there's a natural of this American life. This is a natural beat structure
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:36.400]   that's almost built into our biology of I think it's 45 seconds. He has a whole talk he does about
[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:40.640]   this natural structure. You know what comes to mind? This is very similar to our conversation
[01:11:40.640 --> 01:11:45.280]   about messaging earlier, which is essentially that we're moving into a fragmented world
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:50.320]   where there are lots of different flavors and you pick the flavor that suits you.
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:55.600]   I'm looking at high maintenance. It's interesting. This is on Vimeo. It's a it's a
[01:11:55.600 --> 01:12:00.720]   series. Have you watched this Jill as a series? Yeah, I've seen a little bit of it. It's a dollar
[01:12:00.720 --> 01:12:08.480]   99 episode. It's just the same as like a real TV show. Yeah, it is a real TV show. But it's on Vimeo.
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:14.320]   Yeah, so that doesn't mean anything. I guess you're right. And we as in our chat room keep saying
[01:12:14.320 --> 01:12:19.040]   you guys are missing the point. It's about cost. The cable companies are charging us so much.
[01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:23.600]   We're just trying to save money. I don't think that's the case. I think that is that there is
[01:12:23.600 --> 01:12:29.360]   that is the case. It is. They keep charging for things we don't want. You know, people
[01:12:29.360 --> 01:12:33.600]   feel happily paper things. They want right. It's much like the music industry selling you an
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:38.240]   album when you only wanted one song. Except that's like as soon as you can go out a cart you will.
[01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:42.400]   It's like a hundred channels you will never ever watch. At least if you buy an album. It's all
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:47.520]   by the same person. I do think we're willing to pay for our content though. You know what I'm saying?
[01:12:47.520 --> 01:12:52.960]   I don't. I think that people don't want free content. If it's good content, I think people will
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:58.720]   pay for Game of Thrones. HBO now as far as I can tell is a success, right? HBO is doing well
[01:12:58.720 --> 01:13:03.360]   because it's set the standard so very high. Right. That people are willing to pay for it.
[01:13:04.080 --> 01:13:08.640]   Well, not everybody can be HBO or New York Times. Right. Just be let's be very, very.
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:16.000]   That's the scarcity. Frankly is telling. That's the ball acting. I think HBO has done a great job
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:23.120]   of maintaining quality and being very clear about what they stand for. I think New York Times
[01:13:23.120 --> 01:13:28.960]   has done a good job so far. But I see that they're starting to go down this path.
[01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:36.560]   Stumbling. Yeah. They're starting to miss out who they really are and why we are willing to pay
[01:13:36.560 --> 01:13:43.360]   for them. I think that's the other thing. You know, the thing which we have never talked about
[01:13:43.360 --> 01:13:50.400]   or like people don't talk about is like how storytelling it will actually be different going
[01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:56.880]   forward because the technology is different. Right. So, you know, Jill was talking about 26
[01:13:56.880 --> 01:14:03.840]   minute blocks or 58 minute blocks. But think about it this way. Today, we can stop and have
[01:14:03.840 --> 01:14:12.960]   a video sync to another screen at any time. Like so we don't watch. Like I have not sat down and
[01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:19.680]   watched a single movie, you know, end to end. Like I just maybe watched 10 minutes there and 15
[01:14:19.680 --> 01:14:23.600]   minutes there. Well, you're right. Interstellar, which I watched in the theater was interminable in
[01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:29.280]   the theater. But we watched it over three nights again and it was great. Right. Three chunks.
[01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:36.160]   And that's where the storytelling is different. Right. That's where the idea of what is video
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:41.280]   content is different. You know, the idea of television as we know it doesn't make any sense
[01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:49.120]   because we are in full control of how we experience it. Right. How we experience it defines what is
[01:14:49.120 --> 01:14:55.200]   going to happen to the medium. And it is not going to be a mass medium as a result of that.
[01:14:55.200 --> 01:15:01.600]   And I think the most of the television industry misses the point about that completely misses
[01:15:01.600 --> 01:15:08.160]   the point that we are in charge. Like we mean the end customer is in charge of how that's
[01:15:08.160 --> 01:15:15.120]   the beauty. I think people talk about caught cutting DVR was the most disruptive thing that
[01:15:15.120 --> 01:15:19.040]   happened to tell them. Yes. As soon as you didn't have to watch it live, everything changed.
[01:15:19.040 --> 01:15:23.680]   And you could and you could pause it and let's not forget you could skip commercials.
[01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:31.440]   And that's a that's a big issue for advertisers and the and the monetization. Do you think we're
[01:15:31.440 --> 01:15:35.680]   going to go pay wall? We're going to everything will be for pay that the idea of free advertising
[01:15:35.680 --> 01:15:44.560]   supported media is threatened by this zone. I don't know. I mean, I sometimes I'm hoping you say no
[01:15:44.560 --> 01:15:54.800]   because that's what we're doing here today. Okay, no. I knew I should go into that preaching
[01:15:54.800 --> 01:16:00.960]   thing. I really feel like that I blew I missed. Yeah, miss the bet. Yeah, I think you're doing
[01:16:00.960 --> 01:16:06.080]   a good job though. A preaching? Yeah. Well, you know, if there's a threat, the throughline through
[01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:12.800]   all of this is that the technology is completely disruptive. And are what's really interesting is
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:20.000]   human behavior is as much disrupted as the you know, the business models. Business models have to
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:25.600]   accommodate these new human behaviors and it's hard. It's a moving target. I watch, you know, I
[01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:30.960]   watched my kid. I love using my kids as an example, but I watched them go from as you know, when we
[01:16:30.960 --> 01:16:34.400]   were teenagers, we were on the phone while we did our homework. I watched my daughter be on instant
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:38.880]   messenger while I was doing she was doing her homework with music playing to watching my son
[01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:43.760]   be on a multiple conference call with Skype while he's doing his homework. I mean,
[01:16:43.760 --> 01:16:49.440]   and that's in a couple of years. It's changing so rapidly. I don't blame NBC and via common
[01:16:49.440 --> 01:16:55.920]   and ESPN Disney for having some trouble figuring out what the hell we want and where it's all going.
[01:16:55.920 --> 01:16:58.000]   And by the time they do figure it out, I want something else.
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:03.200]   You know what I want? I want a $25,000 Panama hat, but I'm not getting it.
[01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:09.760]   Why not? Did you see that amazing story today in the New York Times about the
[01:17:09.760 --> 01:17:16.000]   the best Panama hat ever made? Was it the Times? I think it was. No, no, it was. It wasn't the
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:20.080]   Times. It was New York magazine. You should totally get it.
[01:17:20.080 --> 01:17:28.720]   You look at for look up Panama hat. There's one last guy. The world's finest Panama
[01:17:28.720 --> 01:17:36.080]   world. Yeah, and who buy it is that it's NPR. Sorry. Great. See, and by the way, that's another
[01:17:36.080 --> 01:17:40.080]   point. You don't you don't know where you read the story anymore. And Ecuador,
[01:17:40.080 --> 01:17:45.680]   you know, but even goes to the front page of the New York Times. You deep link everything, right?
[01:17:45.680 --> 01:17:52.880]   Yeah, this this guy, he's never going to do it again. He's woven one the last one.
[01:17:53.760 --> 01:17:59.040]   And and there nobody knows how to make these anymore. There's their fake Panama hats with
[01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:04.240]   bleached and their dad, but this is like what 800 thread count. One of his lesser
[01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:07.920]   hats went for 25 grand. Yeah, to a movie star who wanted it for his honeymoon.
[01:18:07.920 --> 01:18:12.960]   But they don't even know what this one's worth because they'll never be another like it.
[01:18:12.960 --> 01:18:21.040]   I don't know how I got on that. He's like the Strata various of Panama hats. The Strata various,
[01:18:21.040 --> 01:18:24.320]   thank you, if Panama hats.
[01:18:24.320 --> 01:18:30.320]   I'm pressing. Can I break up one other thing about the Apple about? Oh, yeah, please. Would you
[01:18:30.320 --> 01:18:34.480]   thank you? I have my fingers crossed. They're going to announce a large screen iPad, which I'm
[01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:37.680]   personally right. The iPad pro. Yeah, they're like the 12 point you notice.
[01:18:37.680 --> 01:18:42.000]   Pechkowski kind of implied that that might not happen. It sounded like he's leaning against that.
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:46.960]   Yeah, you would think that if it was happening, we might have seen more supply chain leaks.
[01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:52.960]   No leaks at all. There was also a rumor that they would do a new mini iPad mini that looked a lot
[01:18:52.960 --> 01:18:57.520]   like the iPad Air 2, but no supply chain leaks on that either. In fact, the only supply chain
[01:18:57.520 --> 01:19:02.720]   leak I've seen is that is iPhone 6s screens. The Clarissa and they might be doing a large screen
[01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:08.480]   iPad as the stuff they're doing with iOS 9 with the multiple apps on one screen and stuff that
[01:19:08.480 --> 01:19:12.560]   sounds like it's very productivity oriented and would serve you very well if you were trying to
[01:19:12.560 --> 01:19:17.680]   use an iPad more like a PC. So I'm holding out hope, but I'm not all that hopeful that it's going to
[01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:22.160]   happen within the next few weeks. I'm going to go out on a limb here because one of the one of the
[01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:26.480]   few new features in the iPhone is force touch. I'm going to go out on a limb here and say that
[01:19:26.480 --> 01:19:31.760]   is a failed technology. That is just force touch. It may kind of make sense on the watch because
[01:19:31.760 --> 01:19:36.560]   there's not that many things you can do, but I have had force touch now in a couple of Mac laptops.
[01:19:36.560 --> 01:19:41.600]   It's unintuitive. You never know what's going to happen when you click it. Apps don't support it.
[01:19:41.600 --> 01:19:45.920]   Apple supports it, but it's still unclear and it gets in the way things like clicking and dragging
[01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:50.240]   you press too hard. Now suddenly you're doing something completely different. I'm going to go
[01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:56.320]   out on a limb and say that's a flop and no one cares. Which proves my name. I don't even know
[01:19:56.320 --> 01:20:00.960]   what you're talking about. Exactly. It proves my point. Not only is it a flop, oh, I've never even
[01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:08.160]   heard of it. I do have to say Harry, you should try the new MacBook. I love my MacBook. I like that
[01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:13.840]   too. Do you love that? Do you love that? I absolutely love it. And you don't know what force touch is?
[01:20:13.840 --> 01:20:18.800]   Never use it. That's one of the key features of the new MacBook. If the new MacBook had
[01:20:18.800 --> 01:20:23.600]   built an LTE, I'd be more excited about it. Yeah, it's odd that it doesn't. But the new Chromebook
[01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:28.400]   Pixel isn't either. It's actually that should be. I think the only person who likes it. I think you
[01:20:28.400 --> 01:20:33.360]   you have to think about the MacBook as an accessory for your iPhone. That's where we're
[01:20:33.360 --> 01:20:39.520]   in. And Tether. Yeah. It is a really nice MacBook. There is a real hit. That MacBook,
[01:20:39.520 --> 01:20:44.640]   I was not confident I would like it because of the short key travel. It's just the right size.
[01:20:44.640 --> 01:20:47.760]   That is a beautiful screen and I can live with the keyboard. It's not perfect, but I can live
[01:20:47.760 --> 01:20:53.920]   with the keyboard. But here you are with your iPad. You're silly little. And I just realized it's
[01:20:53.920 --> 01:21:00.080]   I started doing it at about the time that Steve Jobs left us because I was in Japan when that
[01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:06.240]   happened at a tech show. So it's been four years. Oh, wow. That's a long time. Mostly iPad. Yeah.
[01:21:06.240 --> 01:21:11.120]   But can you see yourself with a MacBook right there in front of you?
[01:21:11.120 --> 01:21:15.520]   I have an error, which I love and use a lot. Usually if I'm sitting at a desk at work,
[01:21:15.520 --> 01:21:19.920]   I will frequently use my error. You know what? When I decided to get the MacBook,
[01:21:19.920 --> 01:21:24.880]   when I saw that all the Kevin Rose is in the own Malics of the world, we're all using them.
[01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:30.480]   And I thought, well, this must be something. Really? Yeah. We look at it. You for
[01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:37.440]   well, it's a feedback loop. We're going to take a break, come back with more lots more to talk about
[01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:43.280]   a little more Apple news before we go. But first, I want to tell you about stamps.com. I haven't
[01:21:43.280 --> 01:21:47.840]   talked about stamps in a long time. I think you all know, but I hope you all know about stamps.com.
[01:21:47.840 --> 01:21:53.200]   This means you no longer go to the post office. That is awesome. And I'm not talking a postage
[01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:59.120]   meter. Postage meters are terrible. That's so 1980s. They're expensive. You have multi-year
[01:21:59.120 --> 01:22:04.080]   commitments. The ink, there's hidden fees. They change the postal rates. You have to pay to get
[01:22:04.080 --> 01:22:08.240]   the postage meter updated. We're not talking about that. We're talking about the modern way.
[01:22:08.240 --> 01:22:15.200]   Stamps.com. It's software. It's web-based. You can print and buy official U.S. postage for any
[01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:19.440]   letter or package right from your desk with your computer, your printer, no special ink.
[01:22:19.440 --> 01:22:25.120]   You'll get discounts. You can't get it. The post office, it is the ultimate fulfillment. So if you
[01:22:25.120 --> 01:22:30.800]   sell online, if you know, I get, you know, every once in a while, we'll buy something at Etsy and
[01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:36.320]   I get this crazy package. And somebody has licked and placed stamps on it. And it's just, I look at
[01:22:36.320 --> 01:22:42.560]   that and I go, "Why? Why aren't you using stamps.com?" If you're, if you sell on Etsy, eBay, Amazon,
[01:22:42.560 --> 01:22:47.120]   it will take the information from the website. You don't have to fill out forms. It prints a
[01:22:47.120 --> 01:22:52.160]   beautiful looking label with exactly the right postage, by the way. I know when they put stamps on

[01:23:57.040 --> 01:24:04.880]   By the way, I'm just reading that the NHL is going to be using MLB Advanced Media for their
[01:24:04.880 --> 01:24:11.120]   streaming. It's a sense. Yeah. It seems like they've solved, they've figured it out, they've solved the
[01:24:11.120 --> 01:24:20.880]   streaming issue. So Apple TV, maybe with new deals, maybe not. It certainly needs a new user interface.
[01:24:20.880 --> 01:24:27.520]   I'd love to see an iPad Pro, although Patch Casky calls that a wild card. New iPhones.
[01:24:27.520 --> 01:24:33.360]   We won't see, I don't think if Apple's true to form new hardware, right? It'll be the same form
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:37.440]   factor, but they'll add force touch, maybe a better camera. New hardware next year.
[01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:42.880]   But if the camera's a lot better, that would be something to get excited about.
[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:46.400]   Does it feel like Apple's falling behind? The camera still looks great, but it's only
[01:24:46.400 --> 01:24:51.040]   eight megapixels. Is that an issue? It's really good. Although lately, I've seen comparisons where
[01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:58.400]   people are... I think my S6 is as good if not better. I think the LG G4 is as good if not better.
[01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:04.320]   So that's got to worry. They have real competition in a way they did not a year ago.
[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:08.720]   But that's what's going to happen. People talk a lot about fragmentation. We've got a new
[01:25:08.720 --> 01:25:20.480]   fragmentation chart from OpenSignal. 24,093 different Android devices, distinct devices,
[01:25:20.480 --> 01:25:27.200]   more than doubled from 2013. Nobody's really got the lion's share. This is the biggest one is the
[01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:35.040]   Galaxy S3 and the S4 and the S5. Then there's lots of little doohickeys like the HTC desire and the
[01:25:35.040 --> 01:25:45.520]   iMobile iStyle and the Alcatel OneTouch. But you can use the word fragmentation, which is kind of a
[01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:54.960]   pejorative. Or you can say this is a vibrant ecosystem and it's hurtful to Apple because the
[01:25:54.960 --> 01:25:59.760]   iteration, the innovation happens so much faster when you're putting down a new phone every few months.
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:04.720]   And Apple's only doing it every year and only new hardware every two years.
[01:26:04.720 --> 01:26:12.480]   Although, I mean, 23,999 or something of those phones, Apple is not paying attention to them.
[01:26:12.480 --> 01:26:16.240]   They don't care about the low end. Yeah, they're just a handful that are serious competition.
[01:26:16.240 --> 01:26:20.800]   From companies that tend to put out one major new flagship phone per year.
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:27.280]   Samsung in fact, struggling a little bit, even though they dominate their 47.5% of the Android
[01:26:27.280 --> 01:26:36.480]   market share, I'm sorry, was 47. It's now down to 37 in a couple of years. Still dominant.
[01:26:36.480 --> 01:26:39.200]   So that's the only one Apple has to think. And they don't even have to worry about the low end
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:44.960]   Samsung. They have to only worry about the top of the line, right? I think the Android ecosystem
[01:26:44.960 --> 01:26:53.280]   doesn't take into account all the fast rising brands, the Xiaomi, the OnePlus, the
[01:26:53.280 --> 01:27:02.720]   Micromax and all those kind of native brands from China and India. I think they are doing their
[01:27:02.720 --> 01:27:08.160]   own version of Android. They're doing their own version of phones. I think those guys
[01:27:08.160 --> 01:27:14.400]   are going to drive this market. I think Samsung is a little bit on the back foot there right now.
[01:27:14.960 --> 01:27:21.920]   And because these smaller companies have huge markets and they're actually way more cooler than
[01:27:21.920 --> 01:27:32.560]   the Samsung. I think I was talking to somebody the other day who was visiting India and came back
[01:27:32.560 --> 01:27:38.880]   and he was telling me that Samsung has lost its pool in all these Asian markets. It's just not a
[01:27:38.880 --> 01:27:46.000]   cool brand anymore because it's like doing too many things and all over the map and it doesn't
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:50.960]   really have a market positioning. However, I think when you think about Apple,
[01:27:50.960 --> 01:27:58.720]   they put our technology way far ahead of everybody else. But the things they put out are actually
[01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:06.400]   usable, right? Like nobody's talking about hacking their fingerprint scanner or their camera doesn't
[01:28:06.400 --> 01:28:12.560]   have to have the most amount of megapixels but yet pictures are still coming out better than
[01:28:12.560 --> 01:28:17.520]   any other camera. Yeah, well, I think you're half right. I think the Apple in fact isn't ahead
[01:28:17.520 --> 01:28:21.920]   of anybody else. But I think you're exactly right that when they do put out a feature,
[01:28:21.920 --> 01:28:28.320]   it works better than others. They did lead with fingerprints. But NFC, they finally got NFC.
[01:28:28.320 --> 01:28:33.760]   They finally got such to pay. But the NFC didn't really work, right? They put the longest time.
[01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:40.000]   Right. Till Apple there. Yeah. I think a lot of the time technology you have to know when to market
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:45.920]   it to people, right? Coming out too soon is just a feature which nobody knows what to do with.
[01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:53.840]   I think camera wise, I'll give you that earphones had better cameras. But you know, the iPhone
[01:28:53.840 --> 01:29:00.320]   takes a really great picture. They're making so much progress on the software inside there.
[01:29:00.320 --> 01:29:05.040]   You know, the visual computing part, they're doing really better than everybody else.
[01:29:05.040 --> 01:29:09.600]   I feel like though, we know that and we care about it. That's not really why people buy
[01:29:09.600 --> 01:29:14.560]   iPhones. That's a small slice. Most people buy iPhones because it's the default.
[01:29:14.560 --> 01:29:20.640]   It's a good phone and it takes great pictures. Like literally you cannot explain to people what
[01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:26.240]   is a great picture. It should take pictures. And other people keep talking about megapixels and
[01:29:26.800 --> 01:29:29.600]   you know, you just like look at the phone and you take a picture.
[01:29:29.600 --> 01:29:33.120]   But he cares about megapixels. I don't think people know that it's 8 megapixels or that
[01:29:33.120 --> 01:29:38.800]   Samsung is doing 13. I don't think they care. And I don't even know if they care about specs or
[01:29:38.800 --> 01:29:45.280]   anything. I think that they, I honestly feel people buy iPhones just because that's what everybody
[01:29:45.280 --> 01:29:51.040]   else buys. It's like buying windows. And one day Android phone will work better than the iPhone
[01:29:51.040 --> 01:29:56.400]   and that's the time Apple should be worried. Right. But you don't think that time has come.
[01:29:57.040 --> 01:30:02.320]   No, I think the phone still works better than most phones. Like it just is more intuitive
[01:30:02.320 --> 01:30:08.880]   than other phones. I don't want to be a polygist for Apple. I just feel that if you're an Android
[01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:14.320]   user, you get a lot more. You have to jump through more hoops than you do with the app.
[01:30:14.320 --> 01:30:19.360]   All these years later, Apple still has the best app star. There are still major apps
[01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:27.200]   that ship later for Android or don't ship it all for Android or the updates come along later.
[01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:30.880]   I think if you want the single best selection of apps, not kind of the things you can't do
[01:30:30.880 --> 01:30:35.520]   at all on an iPhone because Apple won't let you. Apple is still on top.
[01:30:35.520 --> 01:30:40.000]   I think there's a lot of apps that Apple doesn't have or come to Apple after Android.
[01:30:40.000 --> 01:30:45.280]   And that's in that number is flipping. It was. Yeah, it was Apple.
[01:30:45.280 --> 01:30:47.600]   Always assuming it's going to and I still haven't seen it happen.
[01:30:47.600 --> 01:30:52.560]   It hasn't maybe completely, but I think it's on its way. I also think Apple suffers because
[01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:57.760]   their gatekeeper on updates to apps. And I think that causes a problem. Apps do not get
[01:30:57.760 --> 01:31:02.800]   updated as rapidly on iOS. If you use an Android phone, you're getting app updates,
[01:31:02.800 --> 01:31:07.040]   10 or 12 app updates every single day. I know that's a little annoying in some ways,
[01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:11.680]   but I think it makes me feel better that bugs are getting squashed faster because you don't have
[01:31:11.680 --> 01:31:17.040]   to get past the Apple gatekeepers to ship up. Yeah, but why are the bugs there in the first
[01:31:17.040 --> 01:31:22.480]   place already? Oh, come on. You can't tell me that Android apps are more buggy than iPhone apps.
[01:31:22.480 --> 01:31:27.520]   I think we just talked about the difference between Android and iPhone like a few minutes
[01:31:27.520 --> 01:31:34.640]   ago in the emergency, you know, contact information and like apps which are there, but they're pretty
[01:31:34.640 --> 01:31:42.320]   mediocre. I think what I'm trying to say is that because there is a like a editorial process on
[01:31:42.320 --> 01:31:50.000]   the apps, maybe that pushes the quality or like a little bit higher. Maybe forces companies to look
[01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:56.640]   at the bugs more closely before submitting to the apps. You're still talking about the very
[01:31:56.640 --> 01:32:01.360]   savvy consumer, right? Like the very savvy tech consumer knows about the differences between
[01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:07.920]   the app stores and maybe some of the different features of the camera, but at the most basic
[01:32:07.920 --> 01:32:13.440]   level, think about a person who's just buying their first smartphone. If they go with an iPhone,
[01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:16.960]   they have about three choices to make. Right. Like it's really simple.
[01:32:16.960 --> 01:32:21.680]   It's really simple. How much do I want to spend? Are these phones all going to work for two or
[01:32:21.680 --> 01:32:26.880]   three years? Great. If you look at Android, you don't even know where to start. Like sure,
[01:32:26.880 --> 01:32:31.520]   if you went through all the work and read up on all the phones, you could probably find a phone
[01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:36.480]   that would make you very, very happy and have every feature you wanted. But the work of getting
[01:32:36.480 --> 01:32:41.520]   there is so exhaustive that it's easier to just say, here are my three options. They're going to
[01:32:41.520 --> 01:32:46.960]   work. They work with my carrier. Boom, let's do that. Yeah, I think it's a no-brainer. Very much
[01:32:46.960 --> 01:32:51.600]   like buying Windows in the 90s was a no-brainer. And I didn't think at the time Windows was better
[01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:57.520]   than Mac OS. I don't actually think iOS is better than Android now, but I don't, but I can understand
[01:32:57.520 --> 01:33:02.720]   exactly, as you say, Jill, why normal people who don't really want to get involved in this
[01:33:03.760 --> 01:33:10.000]   warfare, just say it's the default. It's easy. Nobody ever got fired for buying an iPhone.
[01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:14.480]   Also, how much money you have in your pocket makes a huge difference, right?
[01:33:14.480 --> 01:33:19.920]   Yeah. If you got $50, you're not buying an iPhone. Well, let's be fair. If you look at global
[01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:26.560]   sales, iPhone is dwarfed by Android. But that's because the low end phones sell a lot more than
[01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:32.960]   the high-end phones. And iPhone has retained its aspiration or quality. I don't think Samsung is
[01:33:32.960 --> 01:33:39.280]   aspirational by any means. Like, I will not, you know, someday I will own a this five.
[01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:44.880]   Yeah, I don't mean an as five or a second. No, not because they're bad.
[01:33:44.880 --> 01:33:50.320]   That phone, they just they commoditize their own products. They just cut prices on their own
[01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:56.080]   products. Isn't there an opportunity for somebody to make an Android phone that is the iPhone of
[01:33:56.080 --> 01:33:59.760]   Android phones? Well, I recently talked to the co-founder of OnePlus who said that's why they
[01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:04.240]   started the company. They figured there was no company in the Android ecosystem.
[01:34:04.240 --> 01:34:09.360]   There's goal was to do the best possible design. And you can argue whether one plus has met their
[01:34:09.360 --> 01:34:14.240]   aspirations. But that was definitely what they set out to do. And they've sold a million and a
[01:34:14.240 --> 01:34:18.480]   half phones despite not having been around very long. Compared to app in the same time frame,
[01:34:18.480 --> 01:34:23.600]   Apple sold 150 million. Right. But that one plus is a really small company. Right. They've had
[01:34:23.600 --> 01:34:28.400]   trouble having units to sell at all. So I think they've had some success. I'm ordering my OnePlus
[01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:34.560]   2 on Tuesday. Yeah, I like I've got enough with that phone. First Android phone I wanted to own.
[01:34:34.560 --> 01:34:40.800]   Yeah. Yeah. Although no NFC and this one, no wireless charging, no fast charging. But the battery
[01:34:40.800 --> 01:34:48.080]   life was so good last year, I'm hoping it will be as good on this new one. Yeah, it's very interesting
[01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:53.040]   for me. You know, one of the roles I like, I think you like this too, is sitting a little bit back
[01:34:54.000 --> 01:35:00.240]   and watching because I just find it fascinating to see the anthropology of all this is fascinating.
[01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:07.520]   Yeah, I love like how much this is the new sport, right? Like people talk about their devices
[01:35:07.520 --> 01:35:12.960]   and they get so angry and passionate about it. And it was like, you know, one of the great joys of
[01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:18.800]   like not being a professional writer anymore, not having to write these stories and have to deal
[01:35:18.800 --> 01:35:25.200]   with the comments. Yes. The comments, you know, buy whatever phone you feel like I got nothing.
[01:35:25.200 --> 01:35:33.760]   I got nothing to prove. Apple's music, which has been out now for a month and a couple of weeks,
[01:35:33.760 --> 01:35:40.640]   according to Apple has done all right, they say, and by the way, this is unprecedented. Apple very
[01:35:40.640 --> 01:35:46.720]   rarely releases this kind of information. They say according to eddy q 11 million trial members
[01:35:47.360 --> 01:35:54.240]   and 2 million of them paying for the family plan, they're actually paying $15 a month for the family
[01:35:54.240 --> 01:36:00.320]   plan. They say they're happy with that number. I have to say they must be. That's 10 times the number
[01:36:00.320 --> 01:36:05.280]   that was using the beats music service when Apple bought it. It was 110,000. So that's good news.
[01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:09.520]   But there you go. That's another example of the default, the tyranny of the default. It's an icon
[01:36:09.520 --> 01:36:15.440]   on your screen. Well, might as well try it. Do you think given the issues some people have had
[01:36:16.320 --> 01:36:21.680]   with Apple music that Apple will keep those the line share of those 11 million people after that
[01:36:21.680 --> 01:36:25.600]   free three months runs out? I think it's the potential to grow a lot because right now
[01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:30.560]   it's kind of scary because there's been so much coverage of glitches and music disappearing and
[01:36:30.560 --> 01:36:37.120]   all kinds of problems. And Apple is likely to iron those out. It might be a more appealing proposition
[01:36:37.120 --> 01:36:43.920]   six months from now. So maybe in time, I talked to my son and I said, you want to do the family
[01:36:43.920 --> 01:36:48.880]   plan on beats? I'm sorry, on Apple music. And he said, why? I said, well, because it only cost me
[01:36:48.880 --> 01:36:56.160]   15 bucks and I can have all of you on it. He said, now I like Spotify. There you go. There you go.
[01:36:56.160 --> 01:37:02.160]   That was literally the end of the conversation. It was like, I couldn't persuade him. No, I like
[01:37:02.160 --> 01:37:09.760]   Spotify. I have to say the beats radio is so good. You listen to beats one? Oh, yeah. I love the
[01:37:09.760 --> 01:37:19.680]   way it is. Really? It's just like, I like the idea of, you know, somebody doing the curation of the
[01:37:19.680 --> 01:37:25.840]   music and really bringing it up. There's a little surprise element to it. It's like, oh, yeah, I
[01:37:25.840 --> 01:37:32.800]   like, I like this song. It's like, you know, just like, it just is a nostalgic feeling, the idea of
[01:37:32.800 --> 01:37:39.120]   a radio station, which is actually, and I also like the idea of it being global, right? You know,
[01:37:39.120 --> 01:37:45.360]   the day it launched, I think I was in Paris that day and I was listening to it on a really hard
[01:37:45.360 --> 01:37:52.320]   Paris afternoon. And I was listening to this music, which was essentially all late night tunes from
[01:37:52.320 --> 01:38:00.080]   LA, I guess, at that time. It was so much fun. It just felt like you're listening to, you know?
[01:38:00.080 --> 01:38:03.760]   Let's listen a little. What's playing right now on beats one?
[01:38:06.320 --> 01:38:09.200]   It's a lose it featuring Rick Ross and Lil Wayne.
[01:38:09.200 --> 01:38:24.720]   What are you kids listening to? Turn that down. Oh, you're very hip. Now, does that make you want to?
[01:38:30.240 --> 01:38:37.200]   I try to listen. You know, it's there's 12 hours of live stuff. This LA with Zain Lowe, who's the
[01:38:37.200 --> 01:38:45.040]   BBC one guy that they stole who I'm told is good. I never hear him. So then there's a New York
[01:38:45.040 --> 01:38:52.720]   DJ. I can't remember his name and there's Julia and Tanuga in London, right? Oh, so good. You like
[01:38:52.720 --> 01:38:59.280]   Julie? Oh, she's because if you feel like you're in the club, don't you? Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. They
[01:38:59.280 --> 01:39:05.280]   do need to add a couple of DJs. Somebody who can. Yeah, it's only 12 hours of the 24. Yeah, but
[01:39:05.280 --> 01:39:10.960]   there's still more 12 hours to go. Interesting thing. Apparently, they have licenses with the
[01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:15.840]   music industry to do more channels. It's not just one. They could do beats two. And I guess if you
[01:39:15.840 --> 01:39:20.720]   think about the name beats one implies there would be a beats two, three or four. Maybe something for
[01:39:20.720 --> 01:39:28.160]   us older folks. Actually, oh, you like it. I do love it. So does it give you a little taste of home
[01:39:28.160 --> 01:39:34.640]   Jill Duffy there in beautiful India? You know, I'm not so much into into music, but I've been
[01:39:34.640 --> 01:39:39.840]   looking a lot lately at a different category of music streaming apps, which are ones for working
[01:39:39.840 --> 01:39:46.000]   out. So you know, I read a lot about fitness tech. I like what Spotify is doing. So Spotify
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:50.720]   running. This is a new feature in Spotify's mobile app. If you are a premium subscriber,
[01:39:50.720 --> 01:39:56.880]   when you run, it will match. It will find some music that matches your cadence or I think it's
[01:39:56.880 --> 01:40:01.520]   just your running cadence right now. Yeah. So you start it and then you start running and then it
[01:40:01.520 --> 01:40:05.760]   gives you something that's appropriate. And it finds out, yeah, what what are your beats like for
[01:40:05.760 --> 01:40:10.240]   your steps and find some music that matches that. So there are some other apps that do the same thing.
[01:40:10.240 --> 01:40:16.480]   One is called spring moves and it does the same thing. So if you are running or wearing a heart rate
[01:40:16.480 --> 01:40:23.200]   monitor, I believe it will match music to that beat. Then there's another one called rock my run.
[01:40:24.240 --> 01:40:31.840]   And I think it's this one that when you wear a heart rate monitor, it actually has a song already
[01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:37.600]   and it speeds up or slows down based on how fast or slow your heart rate is going. So that
[01:40:37.600 --> 01:40:42.640]   one actually was really excited to try it out. But what happened was the music sounded just kind of
[01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:48.960]   weird and frenetic even when it was like electronic music with no lyrics or anything. It just sounded
[01:40:48.960 --> 01:40:54.720]   it sounded off right because it was changing based on how fast or slow I was going. Another one I've
[01:40:54.720 --> 01:41:01.680]   been using lately is called fit radio, FIT radio. And I really like the yoga channels on there which
[01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:08.080]   sounds a little new agey. But it's not it's actually some really interesting DJ mixes of electronic music
[01:41:08.080 --> 01:41:15.520]   with a good beat for that that pace of an activity. So if you do a lot of yoga or even like mild
[01:41:15.520 --> 01:41:21.200]   weightlifting, I feel like it's good music for that. Really, you do a lot of mild weightlifting?
[01:41:21.200 --> 01:41:26.560]   I do. I'm not a heavy, heavy weightlifter. But I don't know how would you say that? How would
[01:41:26.560 --> 01:41:30.160]   you say that? No, I like it. Mild weightlifting. I like it. No, it's good. I'm going to do more of
[01:41:30.160 --> 01:41:36.800]   that. I need to do more of that. I just like a power lifter. Yeah. I could see you though with
[01:41:36.800 --> 01:41:47.920]   the chalk on your hands all taped up. Just really. All right. So Apple Music sounds like they've
[01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:52.880]   really I mean given that they they started with something with 110,000 subscribers, I think 11
[01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:59.760]   million, even if only 10% survive is going to be a good number. I do like beats radio, but I don't
[01:41:59.760 --> 01:42:06.640]   care much for everything else. I'm a huge fan of SoundCloud as well. SoundCloud. So much
[01:42:06.640 --> 01:42:14.160]   more fun. And it's got so much more energy there because you find music which is you know, it's more
[01:42:14.160 --> 01:42:21.520]   like it's more like emerging in many ways. You see a lot of remixes and a lot of there's a lot
[01:42:21.520 --> 01:42:26.720]   more creativity. My younger son listens to SoundCloud all the time. It's interesting you should say
[01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:31.440]   that you're very hip-boom. Yeah, I'm the hip-boom model. It's kind of more like a YouTube model,
[01:42:31.440 --> 01:42:36.240]   right? Like SoundCloud is more the YouTube model if anybody can upload. So there's more stuff to
[01:42:36.240 --> 01:42:40.160]   explore. You get the high end, you get the low end, you get a little bit of everything. Yeah.
[01:42:40.160 --> 01:42:45.280]   Yeah. And he likes the YouTube too. Yeah. I think they won't surprise me to see them do like a
[01:42:45.280 --> 01:42:52.160]   Spotify style. You know. I think an interesting thing that and we've mentioned I mentioned this
[01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:59.040]   before which is really that Spotify lives only at the you know on the tolerance of the record
[01:42:59.040 --> 01:43:02.720]   labels and any moment the record labels could just pull the plug and say, "No, I like to be..."
[01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:09.040]   You know what? It's not a good idea. Let's remove this yank it and they can yank it from any of these.
[01:43:09.040 --> 01:43:14.080]   None of these guys have a viable model. Nobody really has a business model? There's no real business
[01:43:14.080 --> 01:43:20.400]   model here. Actually, that's not true. I think Spotify is owned by like the record label's own
[01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:29.520]   enough of Spotify. They're not going to pull the rug on them. And I also, they need this badly.
[01:43:29.520 --> 01:43:35.680]   They need something. The record label is the same place as television company. Yeah. We may agree on
[01:43:35.680 --> 01:43:40.240]   that but I don't know if the labels know it. Yeah. Well, just because they're delusional doesn't mean
[01:43:40.240 --> 01:43:45.120]   it's so bad. They're crazy. I think the thing is they're going to push people back into piracy
[01:43:45.120 --> 01:43:48.960]   if they're far too far. Well, I think that's the only thing keeping them honest at this point.
[01:43:48.960 --> 01:43:55.040]   But they haven't shown, I mean, I guess they're doing better than the networks in the movie industry,
[01:43:55.040 --> 01:43:58.560]   but they haven't shown a lot of understanding of what their business is. They still seem
[01:43:58.560 --> 01:44:03.680]   amazingly backward given that we're 15 years into this. Do we even need a record industry?
[01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:11.120]   I mean, even that term seems anti-artistic, the record industry. It sounds like a factory
[01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:15.920]   cranking out hits. Oh, wait a minute. Yes, it is. And true artists, I think no longer need the
[01:44:15.920 --> 01:44:20.960]   record industry. They can go directly to listeners. I feel like the record industry is an anacritism.
[01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:29.440]   You look at the streaming industry and the record industry and you start to view the
[01:44:29.440 --> 01:44:34.160]   world of music in a certain way and you and then you look at it from an artist perspective,
[01:44:34.160 --> 01:44:40.960]   "Oh my God, things are not very good for the art." No. And the only way they can stay relevant is
[01:44:40.960 --> 01:44:48.240]   through live performances. Yes. And that's hard work. And I think this is a...
[01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:52.800]   Oh, my God, it's still going to work for a living.
[01:44:52.800 --> 01:44:58.800]   I'm just... If you have to tour 300 days out of 365, they can be on. That's hard work.
[01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:05.200]   So, and it's hard like they're... And not all of them are like famous, right? Like not all of them
[01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:10.080]   make like, you know, tens of thousands of dollars. But if you could make a living,
[01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:14.400]   a good living doing it, I think that would be a good thing. And I think that more musicians
[01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:19.520]   have a better shot at making a good living while fewer musicians have a shot at being platinum
[01:45:19.520 --> 01:45:25.200]   artists. I don't think that's necessarily a bad thing. Yeah. I do feel that again, here, to
[01:45:25.200 --> 01:45:31.840]   someone or the other will come up with a new model of figuring out how to connect
[01:45:31.840 --> 01:45:40.400]   artists to their fans in a more effective way, which is, you know, like one of the companies,
[01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:47.200]   our fund is involved in is called Bandcamp. And that does a lot. That's huge. And, you know,
[01:45:47.200 --> 01:45:53.280]   I like, I see that and I find so much amazing music there. So you start to think it's like,
[01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:58.640]   there is something much bigger which will happen in the industry. It can't just be...
[01:45:58.640 --> 01:46:03.760]   Well, I think Bandcamp's a great example, actually. That's an example of artists going directly to
[01:46:03.760 --> 01:46:11.440]   their audience, right? Yeah. I think we just have had the old idea of creative industries,
[01:46:11.440 --> 01:46:17.280]   which is, again, I keep talking about the mass. Everything was built around the idea of mass
[01:46:17.280 --> 01:46:23.440]   market. I don't think that idea works anymore. I'm not going to go and say that, you know, long
[01:46:23.440 --> 01:46:31.280]   tail or anything. I just feel the idea of mass audience, you know, mass media, that idea is
[01:46:31.280 --> 01:46:38.320]   of the past. That's the theme of the show. Yeah. The future is fragmented and it's a good thing.
[01:46:38.320 --> 01:46:47.840]   Let a million blossom, a million flowers bloom. I remember talking to Paul Simon. Nice name,
[01:46:47.840 --> 01:46:53.040]   drop-on. At dinner, we were at dinner, Paul Simon and I. The Paul Simon and Garfunkel,
[01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:58.240]   the Paul Simon. Not the Senator. Not the Senator, Paul Simon. And we were talking about the music
[01:46:58.240 --> 01:47:01.520]   industry and he said, "Yeah, but Leo, I'm worried because his two kids, I guess, are musicians. I
[01:47:01.520 --> 01:47:04.960]   didn't know that." And I said, "Paul, you made it. You don't have to worry about it." He says,
[01:47:04.960 --> 01:47:09.920]   "Yeah, but I worry for my kids because they want to be musicians. They want to be working
[01:47:09.920 --> 01:47:15.680]   artists and it's not clear what path they should follow. But what is clear is they can't follow
[01:47:15.680 --> 01:47:21.680]   their dad's path. That platinum artist, that's not going to happen." Paul Simon, you've heard of him?
[01:47:21.680 --> 01:47:25.520]   All right, I just thought I'd do a little name drop. Well, we take a break. Hey, you know, if you
[01:47:25.520 --> 01:47:31.600]   missed anything this week on Twitch, fortunately, we've edited it all down into 60 seconds you can
[01:47:31.600 --> 01:47:39.920]   watch right now. Previously on Twitch. Are you ready to go surfing in your sofa?
[01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:46.720]   Tech News today. China's slide into a new totalitarianism when the Chinese government announced plans
[01:47:46.720 --> 01:47:52.320]   to station police officers inside major tech companies. I kind of get the sense of desperation
[01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:58.000]   in China. They keep trying to lock down the internet more and more there. Mac break weekly.
[01:47:58.000 --> 01:48:05.600]   You need a Niko-Jara pinnacle watch, a high-end Swiss watch, and on the other end,
[01:48:06.880 --> 01:48:13.520]   the Apple watch. There is a gold version, $112,000 in. You got to hand it to them. They found a way
[01:48:13.520 --> 01:48:18.960]   to make the stainless steel watch even more expensive. Tech News tonight. Engadget reports
[01:48:18.960 --> 01:48:24.400]   that researchers in Japan recorded children in a no-saka shopping mall interacting with a robot.
[01:48:24.400 --> 01:48:30.240]   I mean punching, kicking, hitting, shaking, and verbally abusing the robot. So the takeaway from
[01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:35.360]   the story is we do not have the robots to fear. It is the children that we should fear.
[01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:40.960]   Twitch, the happiest place on earth. Coming up this week on Thursday, August 13th,
[01:48:40.960 --> 01:48:45.520]   Samsung will hold one of their big unpacked events. We're expecting Samsung to introduce the
[01:48:45.520 --> 01:48:51.200]   Galaxy Note 5 and Galaxy S6 Edge Plus. And of course, we'll be covering the event live at
[01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:57.440]   8AM Pacific, 1500 UTC at twit.tv/live. That's what's coming up this week. Back to you, Leo.
[01:48:57.440 --> 01:49:02.160]   Our show today brought to you by Fresh Books, the super simple cloud accounting and invoicing
[01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:07.200]   solution for you. If you're a small business owner and entrepreneur, I know I loved Fresh Books. Man,
[01:49:07.200 --> 01:49:12.080]   that saved my life. The worst thing about being a freelancer was doing the invoices at the end of
[01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:17.440]   the month. You'd fire up Excel, you'd get all your expenses, your hours, then you'd fire up
[01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:22.160]   Word and that little template I made and stick the stuff in there. And then, oh, yeah, I'm
[01:49:22.160 --> 01:49:27.760]   invoicing in Canada. I got to convert it to Canadian dollars. Yay, yay. Fresh Books solved all that
[01:49:27.760 --> 01:49:33.360]   for me. This is a while ago. Actually, I started using them in 2004. Super easy to use invoicing
[01:49:33.360 --> 01:49:37.920]   software that looks professional, makes billing painless, and you get paid faster.
[01:49:37.920 --> 01:49:42.880]   This actually is true, but they have research that says you get paid on average five days
[01:49:42.880 --> 01:49:47.280]   faster. And that's because your clients who actually want to pay you hate paying you,
[01:49:47.280 --> 01:49:52.240]   hate the, you know, paying the bills as much as you hate sending the bills. But with the invoice
[01:49:52.240 --> 01:49:57.680]   that comes from Fresh Books, there's a button right on it that says, pay. They can use all the online
[01:49:57.680 --> 01:50:02.800]   payment services out there and it makes it easy for them. So they pay you. It's just everybody loves
[01:50:02.800 --> 01:50:07.760]   it. Everybody's happy. And if you ever have any questions, the Fresh Books support rock stars
[01:50:07.760 --> 01:50:10.960]   are famous for their knowledge and they're right there in the Fresh Books offices,

[01:50:21.600 --> 01:50:26.320]   Can I ask a little favor when you, when they ask, how did you hear about us? Could you mention
[01:50:26.320 --> 01:50:32.000]   to it? Because I think they forgot I exist. FreshBooks.com, tell them Leo sent you.
[01:50:32.000 --> 01:50:36.640]   FreshBooks.com/twit. Put the word "twit" in the, how did you hear about us?
[01:50:36.640 --> 01:50:47.520]   Section, you got 30 days free. Do we, do we all read theft lies and Facebook video,
[01:50:47.520 --> 01:50:54.640]   the posting from Hank Green, YouTube star VidCon creator. He says, Facebook is lying when it says
[01:50:54.640 --> 01:50:59.840]   it's streaming more video than YouTube partly because they've miscounted. And then he also talks
[01:50:59.840 --> 01:51:04.240]   about something called free booting, which is the parent, I didn't know this widespread practice
[01:51:04.240 --> 01:51:11.280]   on Facebook. Big brands will steal, they'll download YouTube videos from quality creators,
[01:51:11.280 --> 01:51:15.600]   and they'll put them on their page to artificially get more likes and views.
[01:51:15.600 --> 01:51:24.560]   He says, as a creator, Facebook is not a good platform for him compared to YouTube. And
[01:51:24.560 --> 01:51:33.120]   he thinks Facebook needs to do a better job. Anything to say about that? I have to say,
[01:51:33.120 --> 01:51:35.840]   if you're a brand, if you're a creator, I should say,
[01:51:35.840 --> 01:51:42.400]   if you're not putting a native video on Facebook, you're kind of missing the boat, right? Do you do
[01:51:42.400 --> 01:51:48.240]   that? We have our video all over, yeah. Yeah, you don't put a link to a YouTube video, you upload it
[01:51:48.240 --> 01:51:52.080]   to Facebook, right? I mean, some of the stuff he said was pretty eye-opening in terms of,
[01:51:52.080 --> 01:51:56.720]   if you link to a YouTube video, people will not see it in anywhere near the quantities they will,
[01:51:56.720 --> 01:52:00.640]   if it's native. Whether Facebook's doing that on purpose or not, you still have to kind of.
[01:52:00.640 --> 01:52:08.080]   I mean, I do feel like in the long term, Facebook has to cater to people like Hank Green. And because
[01:52:08.080 --> 01:52:11.280]   of that, eventually in the long term, that they will do things that will make him happier.
[01:52:11.280 --> 01:52:15.600]   Right. Because as he points out, they're not doing stuff right now to make him happy. And
[01:52:15.600 --> 01:52:20.960]   there are two superpowers of online video, YouTube and Facebook.
[01:52:20.960 --> 01:52:26.320]   That happened fast. You wouldn't have said that a couple of years ago, would you?
[01:52:27.200 --> 01:52:30.240]   Facebook is one of the is like in the same breath as YouTube.
[01:52:30.240 --> 01:52:34.720]   They're not the closest thing. Yeah. Few years ago, there was one superpower.
[01:52:34.720 --> 01:52:41.360]   Now there are two. Facebook is superpower in every respect Matt Russoff writing in business
[01:52:41.360 --> 01:52:48.800]   insider Facebook is the undisputed king of the tech industry. Any dispute? Anybody
[01:52:48.800 --> 01:52:53.840]   wanted to dispute that? Yeah, he should have just said for now. For now.
[01:52:54.640 --> 01:53:05.120]   Because I've read the same headlines about Microsoft and Cisco and Netscape and Apple when I was
[01:53:05.120 --> 01:53:11.920]   very, very young. So everybody says that things are forever and they never are. That's the beauty
[01:53:11.920 --> 01:53:17.600]   of tech industry. You know, we used to say Google is the undisputed king of technology and
[01:53:18.160 --> 01:53:24.960]   wait, really? Now you're going to put Facebook there. So I don't know. I think people just
[01:53:24.960 --> 01:53:32.240]   forget that everything is like at the time value attached to it. He does not point at the end of
[01:53:32.240 --> 01:53:39.120]   us. Yeah, but it there is a stickiness to Facebook because that's where all your friends and family
[01:53:39.120 --> 01:53:44.400]   are. What would it take to put Facebook on the back burner? I mean, it would have to be a
[01:53:44.400 --> 01:53:50.720]   a cat, a cosmic shift. Like I tell you, I've had a pretty rough experience with Facebook lately. I
[01:53:50.720 --> 01:53:55.040]   think, you know, like you said, Leo, it's for friends and family. I do go there to keep up with
[01:53:55.040 --> 01:54:01.200]   people to see what's going on. But I really dislike the feed that I get. And I know that that feed
[01:54:01.200 --> 01:54:07.440]   is curated and ever changing based on my previous actions, my clicks, things I go shopping for online
[01:54:07.440 --> 01:54:12.960]   elsewhere. If it's if you hate your feet, it's your fault. It is my fault. This is my fault for
[01:54:12.960 --> 01:54:18.880]   not spending eight more hours reading my seed, right? Like, why on earth would I do that?
[01:54:18.880 --> 01:54:26.800]   But it's I see so much stuff that I don't care about. I roll my eyes and I don't want to see.
[01:54:26.800 --> 01:54:32.000]   And I don't watch videos on Facebook for that reason primarily as I know if it's if it's there,
[01:54:32.000 --> 01:54:39.440]   it's probably not material that's of interest to me. So I go and I actually have a blocker on my
[01:54:40.480 --> 01:54:44.720]   on my browser that limits my Facebook usage to 10 minutes a day. And I
[01:54:44.720 --> 01:54:50.800]   what maybe two or I use stay focused. But so you but wait a minute, isn't that telling?
[01:54:50.800 --> 01:54:54.080]   You feel like you need something to keep you from using more Facebook?
[01:54:54.080 --> 01:55:01.440]   Well, so I set that up a long time ago and I do I do pop in right like and I check out some
[01:55:01.440 --> 01:55:05.040]   stuff. I see what's going on, but I don't want to spend a lot of time there because I find
[01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:09.040]   I'll start scrolling scrolling scrolling looking to see if there's anything of it. So if you didn't
[01:55:09.040 --> 01:55:14.320]   have this blocker, would you spend more time there? I would probably leave it open more than I should.
[01:55:14.320 --> 01:55:20.320]   That's the other thing I like to log out of Facebook. I don't use the Facebook app on my phone.
[01:55:20.320 --> 01:55:25.440]   I don't use any geolocation tracking when I'm using Facebook in a mobile browser.
[01:55:25.440 --> 01:55:31.920]   Like I'm very I'm kind of sensitive to that. Yeah, and I don't want to be logged into Facebook
[01:55:31.920 --> 01:55:40.800]   all the time letting it see everything else that I'm doing. I feel like I feel like if you need to
[01:55:40.800 --> 01:55:46.160]   use anti-views not to use Facebook, then you probably you probably really like Facebook.
[01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:48.320]   Yeah, it's a mixed message, isn't it? Yeah.
[01:55:48.320 --> 01:55:57.520]   But I feel the same way often when I use Facebook, I feel bad. I want to take a shower afterwards.
[01:55:57.520 --> 01:56:02.720]   But I do notice that that changes sometimes. Like of late, it's been better. And I don't know if
[01:56:02.720 --> 01:56:09.680]   it's fully my fault. They're clearly tweaking it all the time, right? Constantly. But again,
[01:56:09.680 --> 01:56:17.760]   if Facebook isn't like now and forever king, what kind of thing will happen to just
[01:56:17.760 --> 01:56:22.720]   to throw in the Missouri Myspace going to come along and un-thrown Facebook home? Or is it something?
[01:56:22.720 --> 01:56:28.800]   What's going to happen? So don't you remember where we started? We started talking about
[01:56:28.800 --> 01:56:38.320]   messaging and right and messaging as an interface for communications and
[01:56:38.320 --> 01:56:44.400]   staying in touch with each other. We don't know, but you're already beginning to see
[01:56:44.400 --> 01:56:51.920]   that it was big enough threat for Facebook to buy WhatsApp for 20 billion dollars. It was big
[01:56:51.920 --> 01:56:59.120]   enough threat for them to launch Facebook Messenger. So clearly something like that will come out of
[01:56:59.120 --> 01:57:04.800]   nowhere and will be a threat to Facebook. And it has come to think of it. It's not,
[01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:07.760]   maybe we're looking in the wrong place. If we're looking for another technology,
[01:57:07.760 --> 01:57:13.760]   what it really is is behavioral changes so that Google became less dominant, not because
[01:57:13.760 --> 01:57:17.760]   somebody beat them in search, but because search became less important. I mean, like AOL was
[01:57:17.760 --> 01:57:21.600]   not replaced by something similar to AOL. Yeah. You're never replaced by something similar.
[01:57:21.600 --> 01:57:26.400]   Microsoft is not in trouble because there's a better window operating system.
[01:57:26.400 --> 01:57:29.760]   Yeah. And even the cloud, many operating systems irrelevant.
[01:57:29.760 --> 01:57:32.960]   And even Microsoft Office is still doing fine. It hasn't been beat by other office
[01:57:32.960 --> 01:57:36.560]   suites. So it's never something similar. That's always something different.
[01:57:36.560 --> 01:57:41.440]   All right. So we don't know what it'll be because it's not going to be a Facebook-like thing.
[01:57:41.440 --> 01:57:48.720]   It's going to be something else. And that's what makes tech so much more on an interesting.
[01:57:48.720 --> 01:57:51.760]   Yeah. Yeah. It's all paradigm shift all the way down.
[01:57:51.760 --> 01:57:57.360]   I do think they bought WhatsApp partially because WhatsApp was one of the more plausible,
[01:57:57.360 --> 01:58:02.560]   scary competitors just because of the enormous growth. Was it defensive only? Not entirely now.
[01:58:02.560 --> 01:58:05.920]   But I think that was probably part of it. If you were going to make a list before they bought it,
[01:58:05.920 --> 01:58:10.960]   of things that might compete with Facebook, they would have been high up on the list.
[01:58:10.960 --> 01:58:16.560]   Look at Twitter. Twitter struggling all of a sudden. I don't know if you'd ever would have
[01:58:16.560 --> 01:58:20.480]   said Twitter was on top of the world, but it certainly looked like it had an
[01:58:20.480 --> 01:58:27.200]   unassailable position as the Internet's dial tone. Now we're hearing that Dick Costalo says he's
[01:58:27.200 --> 01:58:31.680]   going to leave as soon as they find a new CEO. We don't know who that CEO is. Twitter's stocked
[01:58:31.680 --> 01:58:36.640]   down so much. People are saying there might even be, Google might even just do a hostile takeover.
[01:58:36.640 --> 01:58:44.080]   Is Twitter coming back or is it all over for Twitter? I mean, how could it even be all over?
[01:58:45.280 --> 01:58:51.200]   It's not all over. It can't be all over. I wouldn't mind, but I'm just saying,
[01:58:51.200 --> 01:58:57.280]   Google, it's all over for Google+, right? Not that it ever was like all that.
[01:58:57.280 --> 01:59:02.960]   You would have big user of Google+, but I liked Google+, but see what I'm looking for isn't
[01:59:02.960 --> 01:59:11.040]   necessarily the biggest, most successful platform because I'm in some ways that's what I don't want
[01:59:11.040 --> 01:59:15.840]   because I don't want everybody to be using it. I want something exclusive. I want a private club
[01:59:15.840 --> 01:59:19.520]   just for me and my close personal friends. That's kind of where they're going. They say Google+
[01:59:19.520 --> 01:59:25.360]   is going to be about special interests rather than the masses. Communities, which kind of makes sense.
[01:59:25.360 --> 01:59:36.880]   You never liked it? No, no, no better. No, I just didn't care much for yet another social
[01:59:36.880 --> 01:59:41.200]   network from a company, which is not very social. Our social network's over.
[01:59:41.200 --> 01:59:48.960]   No, I mean, human beings are social. So to say that social networks are over, you say human beings
[01:59:48.960 --> 01:59:56.720]   are over. I just think Google as a company was all about using engineering and logic and a lot of
[01:59:56.720 --> 02:00:04.720]   them is to make search, web faster, and show ads against it. That's it. Anything beyond that is
[02:00:04.720 --> 02:00:10.880]   just like them trying to convince themselves that they're better than that. I think they don't love
[02:00:10.880 --> 02:00:17.680]   what they do, which is sell ads. That's pretty much Google's big issue is they're good at that.
[02:00:17.680 --> 02:00:22.960]   They're very good at that. They're probably the best at that. But it seems like Facebook is
[02:00:22.960 --> 02:00:26.560]   getting really, really good at that too. Well, and there's this problem because I think
[02:00:26.560 --> 02:00:31.200]   advertisers are starting to realize if Google admitted 56% of all the ads they sell are never seen.
[02:00:33.760 --> 02:00:40.240]   That's not a good number. You know, the guy we don't talk about enough is Jeff Bezos. And
[02:00:40.240 --> 02:00:48.960]   I don't know. So a long time ago, I talked to him and he often talked about like, why does advertising
[02:00:48.960 --> 02:00:57.520]   exist? And he pointed out the core reason advertising exists is to sell people things, whether it was
[02:00:57.520 --> 02:01:02.640]   physical things or digital things, or in terms of like content and selling content.
[02:01:03.200 --> 02:01:08.400]   But it was all about getting people to buy something else. And he says, what if you remove
[02:01:08.400 --> 02:01:14.640]   that need to buy something else, like remove the middleman, the advertising, and made it
[02:01:14.640 --> 02:01:22.000]   easier for people to go from, let's say, what you and I are talking straight to a purchase,
[02:01:22.000 --> 02:01:26.720]   you know, buy something from that. Like, you know, you and I talk about a device, we like it.
[02:01:26.720 --> 02:01:31.280]   Other people believe what we're saying, and they go by. Oh, it's always better than advertising,
[02:01:31.280 --> 02:01:37.440]   isn't it? Right. I think the internet enables that behavior much more effectively.
[02:01:37.440 --> 02:01:44.400]   Yes. The reviews on Amazon, for me, anywhere, must stop before I buy anything. I read the reviews.
[02:01:44.400 --> 02:01:50.720]   If you look at Wirecutter is another good example of a company, which is succeeding by just being
[02:01:50.720 --> 02:01:56.800]   saying, you know, this is what we really feel about this device. And if people want to buy it,
[02:01:56.800 --> 02:02:01.280]   they just click on a link, or they don't have to click on their link. Like, that's the even.
[02:02:01.280 --> 02:02:06.480]   So I think the need for advertising is going to start to go away.
[02:02:06.480 --> 02:02:09.120]   Does Wirecutter not have any ads? No.
[02:02:09.120 --> 02:02:15.120]   So the revenue they make, and it's, I'm sure, significant at this point, comes from the affiliate
[02:02:15.120 --> 02:02:17.680]   codes on the links. Yeah.
[02:02:17.680 --> 02:02:26.720]   That Brian Lambs, no dummy. No, because he's catering to just one audience, which is his
[02:02:26.720 --> 02:02:31.360]   reader. Yeah. I think that's the number one thing which works for that site is that,
[02:02:31.360 --> 02:02:35.600]   you know, they take everything they write very seriously. If you don't,
[02:02:35.600 --> 02:02:41.360]   you know, if I can't trust what they have written, I'll probably not shop or never click there.
[02:02:41.360 --> 02:02:45.760]   So I think that's the key thing. They are moving away from their original premise,
[02:02:45.760 --> 02:02:51.520]   which was the one. They have a broader range of product recommendations now.
[02:02:51.520 --> 02:02:56.480]   Yeah. Yeah. Maybe it maybe that's telling. It used to be that what's the best TV
[02:02:56.480 --> 02:03:00.000]   now? It's what's the best $500 TV? What's the best small TV?
[02:03:00.000 --> 02:03:05.040]   Again, like I said, we are all different snowflakes. So everybody has a different need.
[02:03:05.040 --> 02:03:12.000]   You know, you remember consumer reports. They used to have all these variations on
[02:03:12.000 --> 02:03:18.720]   technologies and also on reviews, or what reviews, what kind of. No ads. No ads.
[02:03:18.720 --> 02:03:22.960]   No ads. No ads. And that's what really it is, I think.
[02:03:22.960 --> 02:03:25.680]   But advertisers hate it because they can't buy the review.
[02:03:25.680 --> 02:03:30.320]   Well, you make sure you have to make a product which people want to buy.
[02:03:30.320 --> 02:03:38.000]   Oh, come on. That's too hard. I know. Interesting. I think Bezos is smart.
[02:03:38.000 --> 02:03:43.520]   I think we should watch him what he does. Yeah. Rest of the industry does five years.
[02:03:43.520 --> 02:03:50.400]   Well, he had a loss with the fire phone, which is basically a total write off. But I have to say,
[02:03:50.400 --> 02:03:57.760]   Echo is pretty amazing. Echo is fun. And people have a much, even though I don't know if Echo is
[02:03:57.760 --> 02:04:02.720]   really better than Siri or Google now. People like it better, which is interesting. I mean,
[02:04:02.720 --> 02:04:08.320]   as a service, there's a lot of work left. Right. Siri, I kind of wish they would enable
[02:04:08.320 --> 02:04:14.720]   it to work either as an interface for Google now or Siri. But the hardware idea is great.
[02:04:14.720 --> 02:04:20.000]   Speaking of the end of the line, Nokia has sold off the Maps division. I don't know how much. I
[02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:26.160]   don't know what, but oh, Nokia has left now here maps, which were in play. I would imagine that
[02:04:26.160 --> 02:04:29.360]   there are a number of companies would have liked this. Uber was rumored to be one of the
[02:04:29.360 --> 02:04:33.520]   companies on the market because maps are very important to them and end up being sold to
[02:04:33.520 --> 02:04:40.960]   a consortium of BMW, Audi and Daimler, but not for a lot of money, only 2.8 billion euros,
[02:04:40.960 --> 02:04:47.040]   which is I would have thought it would be worth more. But I think we were talking about this on
[02:04:47.040 --> 02:04:51.120]   Windows Weekly. The problem is it's one thing to buy it, but now you've got to spend millions
[02:04:51.120 --> 02:04:56.320]   every year to maintain it and update it and make it better. So it's an expensive product to own.
[02:04:56.320 --> 02:05:01.280]   Maybe that's what they have. They have to own it, right? Without that,
[02:05:01.280 --> 02:05:07.440]   they don't have any mapping data. They can they have to own and maintain it so that they can get
[02:05:07.440 --> 02:05:14.000]   proprietary data around, around traffic conditions, maps, stuff like that, so that whenever they
[02:05:14.000 --> 02:05:21.200]   introduce self-driving cars or automatic cars, they need this data.
[02:05:21.200 --> 02:05:26.240]   Without that, they can't compete with Google.
[02:05:26.240 --> 02:05:31.200]   You just put it all together for me.
[02:05:31.200 --> 02:05:34.160]   I can't believe you. It's about autonomous vehicles.
[02:05:34.160 --> 02:05:38.160]   Or even semi-autonomous vehicles.
[02:05:39.680 --> 02:05:44.640]   Well, if you're just making a car with a GPS in it, you could rent it from other companies.
[02:05:44.640 --> 02:05:49.600]   But if you're building an autonomous vehicle, your whole business is reliant on the maps. You
[02:05:49.600 --> 02:05:55.520]   better own them. Very interesting, which is, by the way, why Uber wanted it because it's
[02:05:55.520 --> 02:06:02.720]   business is relying on the maps as well. I think we should wrap it up here. We've gone on long
[02:06:02.720 --> 02:06:09.840]   enough. The sun is finally up in Chennai. Birds are singing. Coming up.
[02:06:09.840 --> 02:06:14.800]   Hey, Jill, thank you so much. I had no idea it was so early in the morning. I'm not sure we would
[02:06:14.800 --> 02:06:20.800]   have called you, but if you don't mind doing it again, we'll have you back. Yeah, no, this is my
[02:06:20.800 --> 02:06:26.160]   crazy lifestyle now, so I'm all in. All right. We love having you on for PC Magazine. Look for
[02:06:26.160 --> 02:06:34.080]   our article on those ICE programs tomorrow at PCMag.com. You can follow her on the Twitter, Jill E.
[02:06:34.080 --> 02:06:40.640]   Duffy. Yeah, thanks for having me. Thanks for being on the show. Thanks to, oh, Malick as well.
[02:06:40.640 --> 02:06:44.960]   Oh, it's great to see you now that you're back. You're out of mourning. You stopped wearing black.
[02:06:44.960 --> 02:06:50.400]   You've taken the, you've taken the, uh, crepe off the mirrors in your house.
[02:06:51.920 --> 02:07:00.880]   You're ready to venture out into the world. Yes. Yeah. Which was worse, the heart attack or the
[02:07:00.880 --> 02:07:07.440]   closure of GigaOM? I think it's part of the journey, my friend. Yeah. I can't say it was one was worse
[02:07:07.440 --> 02:07:13.280]   than the other. You're like guru. Both taught be very valuable lessons. I'm learning from you.
[02:07:13.280 --> 02:07:17.520]   You're the valuable lesson. It's great to have you. Thank you so much for having me. We really
[02:07:17.520 --> 02:07:24.960]   appreciate it. O M dot CO. He is the man with the only two letter Twitter handle at O M.
[02:07:24.960 --> 02:07:29.760]   Rocket. Thanks. So thank you. You can go out clubbing now.
[02:07:29.760 --> 02:07:38.240]   Julie, that's a new this waiting for you. Yes. Harry McCracken always great to see you. You went
[02:07:38.240 --> 02:07:43.520]   up through the traffic and the fog and the smog. We're glad you made the trip up with Marie.
[02:07:43.520 --> 02:07:46.480]   It's good to see you too, Marie. Great pictures from the audience. I've been
[02:07:46.480 --> 02:07:51.760]   liking them on Facebook. What else do you want to talk about? Fastcompany.com,
[02:07:51.760 --> 02:07:56.160]   what you working on? I have a bunch of cool secret projects I'm working on. I have a good
[02:07:56.160 --> 02:08:02.320]   story going up this coming Friday. But it's super secret, right? Come back on Friday.
[02:08:02.320 --> 02:08:06.880]   Follow them on Instagram too. The less likely it is you can talk about it ahead of time.
[02:08:06.880 --> 02:08:12.640]   Yeah, right. That means it's a good one. Yeah. Did you? You were at time for a while, right?
[02:08:12.640 --> 02:08:16.960]   Time for a little while. Did you see the very funny article on what's wrong? Why does time
[02:08:16.960 --> 02:08:28.240]   magazine hate geeks? The cover of I guess this week's time is of Palmer of Oculus Rift looking like
[02:08:28.240 --> 02:08:38.720]   a complete and utter nerd. Would you be if you were Palmer lucky? Would you feel bad with that
[02:08:38.720 --> 02:08:41.920]   picture on the front cover? See if I can find it. He actually took it really well. He's a good
[02:08:41.920 --> 02:08:47.280]   sport. If you look at his Facebook page, he has been sharing that cover and the
[02:08:47.280 --> 02:08:52.400]   variance on that cover that people have been putting together. That's pretty funny.
[02:08:52.400 --> 02:08:54.720]   People read time magazine.
[02:08:54.720 --> 02:09:05.200]   He's really, is that the cover? That's just a video. Let me see if I can find the image from the
[02:09:05.200 --> 02:09:13.200]   cover. There we go. You got it. Actually, somebody put a dinosaur under him. I don't know if that's
[02:09:13.200 --> 02:09:18.880]   the meme. The left is the actual cover and the right is even better.
[02:09:18.880 --> 02:09:28.320]   Apparently, there's an internet meme of Palmer lucky images. If you write for magazines,
[02:09:28.320 --> 02:09:32.800]   you have to really quickly get emotional separation between you and the covers,
[02:09:32.800 --> 02:09:37.360]   given that not only do you not do the covers, but they don't really check in with you about how
[02:09:37.360 --> 02:09:45.200]   you feel about the covers. I'm sorry. This is for the video extras on the show today.
[02:09:45.200 --> 02:09:56.000]   Lucky Oppo style. Where is he? Isn't this one? I don't see him. Oh, that's him.
[02:09:57.520 --> 02:10:00.800]   Looking right. Just sitting there. Not dancing on the beach or nothing.
[02:10:00.800 --> 02:10:06.880]   King of the world. Oh my.
[02:10:06.880 --> 02:10:17.680]   With Vladimir Putin on horseback, flying through a space in virtual reality with,
[02:10:17.680 --> 02:10:22.560]   I don't know, some wrestler on the moon. You could be anywhere in Oculus Rift.
[02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:27.680]   Thanks for joining us. We do this week in tech every Sunday afternoon, 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m.

[02:11:03.120 --> 02:11:05.120]   [Applause]
[02:11:05.120 --> 02:11:11.440]   Do you have a Twit? All right. Do you want a Twit, baby? Do you want a Twit? All right. Do you want a Twit?
