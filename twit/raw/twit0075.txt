[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:36.320]   Twits at sea.

[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:53.760]   We are convened, this is Twits at sea.
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.900]   We're convened on a boat, somewhere in the middle of the,
[00:00:57.900 --> 00:00:59.720]   either the Gulf of Mexico or the Caribbean,
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:00.720]   thanks to our hosts.
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:01.720]   Thank you very much.
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:02.720]   You did that.
[00:01:02.720 --> 00:01:03.720]   Thanks.
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:04.720]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:06.720]   Either you had the burrito at the end of it.
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:07.720]   Yeah.
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:08.720]   [ Music ]
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:14.200]   The boat is the Veen Dom and we are in the Caribbean or the,
[00:01:14.200 --> 00:01:15.960]   I don't know, let me ask the cat,
[00:01:15.960 --> 00:01:16.960]   Captain Neil.
[00:01:16.960 --> 00:01:20.840]   You know, this is the Caribbean now, but I think,
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:23.200]   but the Gulf of Mexico, we're doing both things.
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:24.200]   Yeah.
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:27.480]   Neil Bauman is the founder and creator and the host of Geek Cruises.
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:29.740]   Now, Insight Cruises, right?
[00:01:29.740 --> 00:01:34.300]   That is correctly, we're in the process of adding that name and then slowly changing
[00:01:34.300 --> 00:01:36.580]   to that name over a period of time.
[00:01:36.580 --> 00:01:42.740]   So we'll continue to use Geek Cruises, but Insight Cruises will be a better representation
[00:01:42.740 --> 00:01:46.860]   of the broad range of cruises we are offering going forward.
[00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:49.220]   This is number 35.
[00:01:49.220 --> 00:01:51.220]   This is number 35, that is correct.
[00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:53.860]   Actually, this is sailing number 35.
[00:01:53.860 --> 00:01:59.980]   We've done over 40, I think it's 43 different topics on these 35 sailings.
[00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:00.980]   Wow.
[00:02:00.980 --> 00:02:03.900]   This was a Mac Mania and a Photoshop cruise, yeah?
[00:02:03.900 --> 00:02:04.900]   Actually, no.
[00:02:04.900 --> 00:02:13.220]   We had a good track of Photoshop and photo editing and aperture and some other applications
[00:02:13.220 --> 00:02:18.260]   that have been long and their story were running, but this was just a plain old Mac Mania.
[00:02:18.260 --> 00:02:19.260]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:02:19.260 --> 00:02:23.380]   One more, we'll give you a plug and then I'll introduce the Twit panel because I do want
[00:02:23.380 --> 00:02:26.420]   to give you a chance to promote your upcoming cruises.
[00:02:26.420 --> 00:02:27.420]   What's ahead?
[00:02:27.420 --> 00:02:28.420]   Thanks, Leo.
[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:29.420]   I appreciate the question.
[00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:35.180]   Well, we do have actually a Mac Mania to Alaska in May and that will have two separate
[00:02:35.180 --> 00:02:37.500]   tracks, two separate events.
[00:02:37.500 --> 00:02:42.980]   One is called Aperture Aura and this is Apple's new photo editing and photo collection.
[00:02:42.980 --> 00:02:44.980]   A lot of interest in that.
[00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.340]   For the professional, absolutely.
[00:02:46.340 --> 00:02:51.260]   I mean, it's a high-end package and Apple's putting a lot of time and energy into it and
[00:02:51.260 --> 00:02:56.460]   we're going to have an aperture class running constantly and then a couple of Mac classes
[00:02:56.460 --> 00:02:57.460]   running.
[00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:05.740]   Between now and then I'm doing a Photoshop, strictly Photoshop and PC cruise and actually
[00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:10.060]   we'll be mostly focusing on Vista, the new operating system from Windows.
[00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:11.060]   I'm on that one.
[00:03:11.060 --> 00:03:12.060]   That's February when?
[00:03:12.060 --> 00:03:15.340]   That is February 3 through 10 and you are on that one.
[00:03:15.340 --> 00:03:16.340]   I can't wait for that one.
[00:03:16.340 --> 00:03:17.340]   That's going to be a lot of fun.
[00:03:17.340 --> 00:03:20.020]   So if you're into Vista or Photoshop, that'll be a good one.
[00:03:20.020 --> 00:03:25.140]   Then the Mac Mania 6 is in the fall for the Panama Canal.
[00:03:25.140 --> 00:03:26.140]   That's correct.
[00:03:26.140 --> 00:03:29.500]   My mom's on that one, not me, but my mom.
[00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:30.500]   She's insisting.
[00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.780]   Have you ever been to the Panama Canal?
[00:03:32.780 --> 00:03:34.660]   It is unbelievable.
[00:03:34.660 --> 00:03:41.900]   It is an engineering marvel built in the 1915 era or so and still is working perfectly
[00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:49.300]   today and it's going to be an incredible experience for anyone who hasn't seen it or done it.
[00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:55.140]   We'll have in addition to a Mac event on that and Waz has said he's going to be on that
[00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:56.140]   one as well.
[00:03:56.140 --> 00:03:58.460]   We're also running a Shakespeare event.
[00:03:58.460 --> 00:03:59.460]   That's really cool.
[00:03:59.460 --> 00:04:01.340]   Shakespeare at Sea with the Oregon Shakespeare Festival.
[00:04:01.340 --> 00:04:02.660]   So I'm really looking forward to that.
[00:04:02.660 --> 00:04:03.660]   That'll be so much fun.
[00:04:03.660 --> 00:04:07.260]   Well thank you for allowing us to do the first Twits at Sea.
[00:04:07.260 --> 00:04:08.260]   Indeed, that's right.
[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:10.060]   Thank you very much for doing it here.
[00:04:10.060 --> 00:04:11.660]   The first ocean going at Twit.
[00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:15.140]   Let me introduce the Twits around the panel.
[00:04:15.140 --> 00:04:20.180]   Something with to my right, it's Randall Schwartz who is the Pearl Maven.
[00:04:20.180 --> 00:04:23.500]   Did programming Pearl and learning Pearl and is here.
[00:04:23.500 --> 00:04:24.780]   You're teaching what on board.
[00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:27.740]   I did a course called UNIX for Mac Geeks.
[00:04:27.740 --> 00:04:29.940]   Oh my god.
[00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:35.260]   Randall is also a security expert and so we're glad to have you on the show today.
[00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:36.260]   Thanks for being here.
[00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:37.260]   You've never done a Twit before.
[00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:38.260]   We've had you on Floss.
[00:04:38.260 --> 00:04:40.940]   Yeah, this is my first time actually sitting here for a Twit.
[00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:41.940]   It's been very fun.
[00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:42.940]   Thank you for inviting me.
[00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:45.820]   There's a lot of panels new here because we couldn't get to Vorac or Patrick or anybody
[00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:46.820]   on the boat.
[00:04:46.820 --> 00:04:48.460]   Steve's Decloa is also here.
[00:04:48.460 --> 00:04:52.220]   He is a senior features writer for Wall Street Journal.
[00:04:52.220 --> 00:04:56.020]   Senior special writer, I'm sorry, is what you're technically called.
[00:04:56.020 --> 00:04:57.540]   And I'm glad you're here.
[00:04:57.540 --> 00:05:00.060]   You're here actually covering the story for the journal.
[00:05:00.060 --> 00:05:04.540]   Well I also, among other things, write an occasional column about the internet called
[00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:08.780]   virtual reality for the Saturday Wall Street Journal for the section called Pursuits.
[00:05:08.780 --> 00:05:10.780]   And that's what brings me on the cruise today.
[00:05:10.780 --> 00:05:11.780]   Good.
[00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:12.780]   Great.
[00:05:12.780 --> 00:05:17.940]   And really good questions for Steve on the stock options issues that are going on right
[00:05:17.940 --> 00:05:18.940]   now.
[00:05:18.940 --> 00:05:22.740]   Also here, Annie Inako, who is one of my favorite Mac guys.
[00:05:22.740 --> 00:05:23.740]   You write for the...
[00:05:23.740 --> 00:05:24.740]   The Sun Times.
[00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:25.740]   The Sun Times.
[00:05:25.740 --> 00:05:26.740]   The agreement for all newspaper.
[00:05:26.740 --> 00:05:28.740]   You sound like Superman.
[00:05:28.740 --> 00:05:31.820]   I'm going to move your mic a little closer to your...
[00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.020]   But just move a closer to your mouth.
[00:05:33.020 --> 00:05:35.740]   I know you didn't brush your teeth this morning but the mic doesn't care.
[00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:40.140]   I trust you've all purelled your hands though.
[00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:42.140]   A very important sanitation on the cruise.
[00:05:42.140 --> 00:05:45.380]   As you can spell from your speakers, my mouth is minty fresh because I've just eaten four
[00:05:45.380 --> 00:05:46.380]   altoids.
[00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:48.580]   My finances are also very clear.
[00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:49.580]   Radio doesn't care.
[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:54.060]   Naomi Pierce is also here of Pierce Communications and a long time cruiser I've met you many
[00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:56.300]   times on shipboard before.
[00:05:56.300 --> 00:05:59.460]   But also a long time kind of member of the internet community going back to the early
[00:05:59.460 --> 00:06:00.460]   days of the well.
[00:06:00.460 --> 00:06:01.460]   Right.
[00:06:01.460 --> 00:06:02.460]   Late 80s.
[00:06:02.460 --> 00:06:03.460]   Late 80s.
[00:06:03.460 --> 00:06:04.460]   Feeling old.
[00:06:04.460 --> 00:06:07.260]   Glad to have you all here.
[00:06:07.260 --> 00:06:11.620]   Let's start off by talking a little bit about the options scandal.
[00:06:11.620 --> 00:06:14.220]   The journal broke that story along with Newsweek.
[00:06:14.220 --> 00:06:17.340]   There's some question about who got there first but I'm going to give the journal credit.
[00:06:17.340 --> 00:06:19.500]   Not on the stock options.
[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.300]   You got that one to yourself?
[00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:22.300]   Well, pretty much.
[00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.900]   I mean basically what happened was there was some academics who had done some research
[00:06:26.900 --> 00:06:34.220]   into the granting of stock options at a lot of different companies and they had studied.
[00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:39.180]   They had discovered that there seemed to be a lot of options that had been granted.
[00:06:39.180 --> 00:06:42.420]   Very opportune times where the stock had been.
[00:06:42.420 --> 00:06:43.420]   At the lowest point.
[00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:46.340]   Extremely low for the month or year.
[00:06:46.340 --> 00:06:47.340]   Explain.
[00:06:47.340 --> 00:06:50.820]   Just before we go too much further what is the scandal?
[00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:53.900]   What is it that the companies have been doing and what's wrong with it?
[00:06:53.900 --> 00:06:58.340]   Well, basically stock options have been around for a long time and they're supposed to provide
[00:06:58.340 --> 00:07:06.460]   an incentive to employees and the way they're supposed to work is you are granted the right
[00:07:06.460 --> 00:07:09.500]   to buy stock at some future date at a set price.
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:14.340]   The way it's supposed to work is the day that the board of directors approves the option
[00:07:14.340 --> 00:07:17.780]   grant is when they set what's known as the strike price.
[00:07:17.780 --> 00:07:19.700]   That should be the value of the stock that day.
[00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:20.700]   Right, that day.
[00:07:20.700 --> 00:07:27.460]   But what had been going on was a lot of companies appear to have been sort of cheating by back
[00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:34.100]   dating the grant date to an earlier date when the price was much lower.
[00:07:34.100 --> 00:07:36.300]   So if I say to you Steve, welcome to Twit Incorporated.
[00:07:36.300 --> 00:07:39.980]   We're going to give you a million shares of Twit at a price of a dollar.
[00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:44.140]   Not the stock price today which is $5 but the stock price of six months ago which is
[00:07:44.140 --> 00:07:45.140]   a dollar.
[00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:48.500]   In effect I've given you $4 a share right out of the box.
[00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:55.340]   Right, and that would be okay if it was properly accounted for and properly disclosed.
[00:07:55.340 --> 00:08:00.060]   This company has a pool of stock that could be at the $1 price that they could then award.
[00:08:00.060 --> 00:08:03.260]   Well again if you account for it properly then it's okay.
[00:08:03.260 --> 00:08:07.980]   But if you claim it was awarded it's what's known as fair market value.
[00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:12.140]   In other words you know there is you know you're pricing it what the price is today and then
[00:08:12.140 --> 00:08:15.620]   maybe it'll go up or maybe it'll go down.
[00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:17.460]   That's how it's normally done.
[00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:24.300]   A lot of companies will award options at the same date every year so you can't sort of
[00:08:24.300 --> 00:08:25.980]   mess around with the dates.
[00:08:25.980 --> 00:08:34.700]   But what a lot of companies are now under investigation for is for approving the stock
[00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:38.700]   option on a particular date but then somehow picking it.
[00:08:38.700 --> 00:08:40.260]   It's like cherry picking a great date.
[00:08:40.260 --> 00:08:45.180]   It's almost like betting on a horse race after the race is run.
[00:08:45.180 --> 00:08:51.580]   And it's there are now over 120 companies including some big names.
[00:08:51.580 --> 00:08:53.580]   It seemed to be endemic to Silicon Valley particularly.
[00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:59.900]   Well it's largely Silicon Valley because stock options became such a big part of compensation
[00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:02.180]   for employees particularly during the internet boom.
[00:09:02.180 --> 00:09:06.900]   But you know Home Depot is one of the companies that's been caught up in this United Health
[00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:10.980]   has been caught up in this of course Apple computers been caught up in this.
[00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:15.300]   As I said there's more than 120 companies and there's scores of them are also under investigation
[00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:20.820]   not just by the SEC that securities in exchange commission but also by the US Justice Department.
[00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:28.180]   And we've already seen more than 40 executives who've lost their jobs over this including
[00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:34.620]   a number of CEOs like for example United Health just this morning I saw that there was another
[00:09:34.620 --> 00:09:38.140]   company Apollo group which is an educational company out of Phoenix.
[00:09:38.140 --> 00:09:40.980]   They just lost a couple of employees.
[00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:42.780]   But isn't it just an accounting?
[00:09:42.780 --> 00:09:44.180]   I mean how illegal is it?
[00:09:44.180 --> 00:09:51.540]   It's not just a number of there have been several criminal cases already.
[00:09:51.540 --> 00:09:56.220]   There have been two cases one involving a Silicon Valley company called Brocade Communications
[00:09:56.220 --> 00:10:01.860]   another a New York company called Converse where there have been indictments and criminal
[00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:04.980]   charges and there have already been some guilty.
[00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:06.340]   What's the crime?
[00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:14.060]   Well in those particular cases the executives were charged with fraud for essentially lying
[00:10:14.060 --> 00:10:17.340]   about the way the options had been recorded.
[00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:22.340]   So for example in Converse among other things they discovered a secret slush fund which
[00:10:22.340 --> 00:10:27.260]   no one knew about which had a bunch of options in there and the board apparently was not
[00:10:27.260 --> 00:10:33.340]   told about it and it was to be given out you know when necessary.
[00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:42.860]   In the case of and there have been two guilty please the CEO of Converse has fled to Namibia.
[00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:43.860]   Converse sneakers?
[00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:46.340]   No Converse with an ad.
[00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:47.340]   Converse okay.
[00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:49.460]   Right which is a link a lot.
[00:10:49.460 --> 00:10:55.420]   Right it's a tech company a pretty big one actually.
[00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:58.940]   There are extra extra the US government is trying to get them back and there are extra
[00:10:58.940 --> 00:11:06.380]   additional proceedings now in the case of Brocade they indicted the former CEO Greg Reyes and
[00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:13.020]   the former vice president of human resources they've entered pleas of not guilty but again
[00:11:13.020 --> 00:11:17.100]   it's a fraud case where who's the victim though.
[00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:26.620]   Well the victim to some extent is the shareholders who aren't told exactly what you know what
[00:11:26.620 --> 00:11:32.740]   you know the value of the options were and the tax implications there was a study done
[00:11:32.740 --> 00:11:37.060]   just last week now a lot of these companies have been forced to restate their earnings
[00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:41.180]   Apple for example is in the process of doing that there was a study done last week that
[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:47.700]   already to date the restatements and again many companies haven't fully restated yet
[00:11:47.700 --> 00:11:53.580]   but those that have it's already surpassed five billion dollars and there's another company
[00:11:53.580 --> 00:11:57.940]   which hasn't even restated yet they've already said it's going to be about one and a half
[00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:58.940]   billion dollars.
[00:11:58.940 --> 00:12:03.020]   Is the money though that goes to whoever got this post-dated option is it really coming
[00:12:03.020 --> 00:12:06.220]   out of the pocket of the shareholders or not really.
[00:12:06.220 --> 00:12:09.020]   Well right it dilutes the value it's not.
[00:12:09.020 --> 00:12:10.020]   It dilutes it.
[00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:13.340]   Right but on the other hand you know when these things come out and when companies suddenly
[00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:18.580]   disclose they've got this problem often the stock price goes down so the people are you
[00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:21.060]   know the shareholders are hurt that way as well.
[00:12:21.060 --> 00:12:23.980]   Although sometimes the cure is worse than the disease I mean when you're talking about
[00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:29.740]   taking Steve Jobs out I mean it's already the former CFO Fred Anderson resigned over
[00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:33.300]   the stock option scandal and a lot of people are calling for Steve Jobs head wouldn't that
[00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:36.740]   hurt the shareholders a lot more if Jobs is forced down.
[00:12:36.740 --> 00:12:37.740]   Absolutely I think so.
[00:12:37.740 --> 00:12:41.700]   I mean if I'm a shareholder I want Jobs to stay in his job I don't want him to be punished
[00:12:41.700 --> 00:12:42.700]   for posting.
[00:12:42.700 --> 00:12:47.300]   Right we don't really know much the situation with Steve Jobs is kind of interesting because
[00:12:47.300 --> 00:12:51.420]   Apple has not really fully disclosed you know what he knew.
[00:12:51.420 --> 00:12:56.340]   I mean what they've said is that there was a grant he received that was backdated but
[00:12:56.340 --> 00:13:01.700]   then they said that that grant was later cancelled and that he didn't benefit from it.
[00:13:01.700 --> 00:13:09.700]   Then they subsequently said that there were 15 different dates between 1997 and I think
[00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:16.860]   January 2002 where options awarded by Apple were backdated but and they further said that
[00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:23.820]   Steve Jobs knew of a few of them but they didn't say which ones we don't know which
[00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:32.100]   were the 15 they said that in the few that he knew about he did not receive or benefit
[00:13:32.100 --> 00:13:38.020]   from them but you know so we don't really know which ones which ones did he know about
[00:13:38.020 --> 00:13:40.460]   they said he wasn't aware of the accounting implications.
[00:13:40.460 --> 00:13:44.220]   I'd be curious who exactly is calling for his head though you know.
[00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:48.540]   I mean this is sort of like the Heath and Reagan face during Iran Contra where they
[00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:52.820]   want what did you know and when did you know exactly and also the knowledge that look we
[00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:56.380]   know we want to get some sort of accountability but we don't think we want to push hard enough
[00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:58.340]   to remove this person from what he's doing.
[00:13:58.340 --> 00:14:03.620]   The CEOs who have been hounded out what did what they do was that somehow worse than what
[00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:04.620]   Jobs did.
[00:14:04.620 --> 00:14:08.140]   Well again we don't really know what Jobs did I mean all we know is that you know he knew
[00:14:08.140 --> 00:14:11.580]   about some of them and that he was unaware of the accounting implications.
[00:14:11.580 --> 00:14:13.900]   I'm not sure what that means to the Iran or where.
[00:14:13.900 --> 00:14:17.220]   Somebody's sidal up to you and say Steve we could we could do something but it'll be
[00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:20.300]   illegal but what we could do is we could give some post-dated shares.
[00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:27.940]   I think those CEOs who've lost their jobs over this largely were found to have not properly
[00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:29.140]   disclosed to their own boards.
[00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:30.140]   Once they found out.
[00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:31.900]   Once they found out and what's happened is.
[00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:33.540]   Apple's been very proactive haven't they.
[00:14:33.540 --> 00:14:39.340]   Well they you know stepped forward and voluntarily decided like many other companies have you
[00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:45.580]   know decided on their own to do an in-house investigation and you know the US government
[00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:49.740]   really doesn't have the manpower to investigate you know a hundred and twenty different companies
[00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:58.660]   so they've largely relied on teams of lawyers hired by the companies themselves to do in-house
[00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:00.500]   internal investigations.
[00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:02.980]   Usually these are outside lawyers.
[00:15:02.980 --> 00:15:11.700]   And you know some of these investigations have been you know pretty extensive and you know
[00:15:11.700 --> 00:15:16.740]   they're usually the findings are turned over to the Securities and Exchange Commission sometimes
[00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:18.580]   the Justice Department.
[00:15:18.580 --> 00:15:22.820]   We know in the case of Apple that that's that's already happened so yeah I mean Apple has
[00:15:22.820 --> 00:15:29.020]   been proactive in terms of you know ordering up its own investigation and conducting one
[00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:34.140]   but again for example with Apple you know they've said they're going to have to restate
[00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:37.980]   their earnings over this but they haven't done it yet so we don't really know the full
[00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:39.580]   extent of the problem at Apple.
[00:15:39.580 --> 00:15:45.100]   But you know taking Apple as a what if for you know as an example if Steve knew about
[00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:51.020]   a hundred percent of his options were backdated that's sort of one thing.
[00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:57.780]   If Steve knew about fifteen out of you know how many hundreds that's a completely different
[00:15:57.780 --> 00:16:02.900]   I just think that sometimes this maybe it does go back to Iran Contra and the people
[00:16:02.900 --> 00:16:04.700]   who are saying well so what.
[00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:07.540]   Is that right right when the Macintosh was first introduced.
[00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:08.940]   84 yeah yeah.
[00:16:08.940 --> 00:16:14.220]   I mean the company has said that they found no misconduct by any member of Apple's current
[00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:16.660]   management team but then they further understood.
[00:16:16.660 --> 00:16:18.020]   But Anderson wasn't current and he.
[00:16:18.020 --> 00:16:22.660]   Well we don't I'll talk about Fred in a second but what they you know they also said that
[00:16:22.660 --> 00:16:28.700]   there were two officers in which well what they specifically said was that that the
[00:16:28.700 --> 00:16:34.260]   investigation the internal investigation by Apple said it raised serious concerns regarding
[00:16:34.260 --> 00:16:39.500]   the actions of two former officers in connection with the accounting recording and reporting
[00:16:39.500 --> 00:16:43.660]   of stock option grants and that they were going to provide all details regarding their
[00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:48.660]   actions to the SEC now they haven't named to these two former officers were now simultaneous
[00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:52.740]   with this announcement they said that Fred Anderson who was a member of the board and
[00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:56.420]   former CFO chief financial officer of Apple had.
[00:16:56.420 --> 00:17:02.180]   It stepped down he resigned for the board he resigned and but we don't to be honest we
[00:17:02.180 --> 00:17:07.180]   don't know was he one of the two former officers they're talking about I mean Apple hasn't
[00:17:07.180 --> 00:17:14.940]   said who they are so a lot of this is going to be left to the SEC and possibly the Justice
[00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:21.100]   Department to determine you know whether there was any say criminal wrongdoing or how how
[00:17:21.100 --> 00:17:25.340]   serious it was again I have to say I'm an Apple shareholder even if it goes all the way
[00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:30.380]   up to Steve Jobs office it seems to me that's not in my interest that he be I mean well
[00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:34.980]   it's not if he's arrested he's arrested shareholders interest for you know a major
[00:17:34.980 --> 00:17:40.460]   I'm an executive to which is worse post dating options regard to the loosened Steve Jobs it
[00:17:40.460 --> 00:17:44.420]   sounds like if a president's dumb enough to flee the country to a place that actually
[00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:46.420]   has extradition.
[00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:52.380]   Maybe he doesn't deserve one might have done the argument.
[00:17:52.380 --> 00:17:55.780]   Well you know this is obviously a continuing story and I know Steve you're continuing to
[00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:56.780]   write about it in the journal.
[00:17:56.780 --> 00:18:01.820]   I suspect there are many much more egregious cases than 15.
[00:18:01.820 --> 00:18:05.340]   It doesn't strike me as Enron level malfeasance or is it?
[00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:11.340]   No I don't think so I think in terms of the number of companies that are under investigation
[00:18:11.340 --> 00:18:17.580]   and we haven't seen it this in terms of just the you know the scope of it since something
[00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:20.700]   like at least 30 years.
[00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:26.460]   So and again I started off before that the role of the Wall Street Journal was there
[00:18:26.460 --> 00:18:33.260]   had been academic studies that had shown a pattern of very opportune stock option grants
[00:18:33.260 --> 00:18:37.820]   where the price was very low but the academics who did the study who turned this over to
[00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:42.700]   the SEC which did launch kind of a small investigation of it somewhat limited just a
[00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:48.820]   few companies they never named any companies and then in March of this year some some of
[00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:54.580]   my colleagues at the journal did a story in which we named six companies that had highly
[00:18:54.580 --> 00:19:01.860]   suspicious grants and we actually calculated what the odds were that these dates would
[00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:07.100]   have been picked where the price happened to be the lowest point of the year and in
[00:19:07.100 --> 00:19:13.100]   one case it was something like one in 300 billion where the odds and those companies included
[00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:20.100]   by the way United Health which and Converse which you know they both of them have lost
[00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:25.500]   their CEOs and we've done many many follow up stories naming other companies and then
[00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:31.900]   you know that once those stories broke then a number of them then the SEC really ramped
[00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:39.140]   up its investigation into this and you know as I say we've seen indictments they've said
[00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:48.540]   there's going to be more it really I agree it it's not necessarily Enron but it is a
[00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:51.380]   you know it's huge in scale.
[00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:55.540]   Is it related also to the overcompensation of executives I mean is it kind of just another
[00:19:55.540 --> 00:19:58.060]   way companies are kind of overpaying executives?
[00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:02.700]   Well I don't know if it's overpaying but certainly that's been one of my colleagues
[00:20:02.700 --> 00:20:05.980]   who's been working on this has written a lot about executive pay and that whole issue
[00:20:05.980 --> 00:20:09.780]   and that's kind of what interested him in this in the first place.
[00:20:09.780 --> 00:20:13.020]   It's just a way of sneakily giving more money to executives.
[00:20:13.020 --> 00:20:16.700]   Well exactly I mean millions of dollars I mean the case of the Converse people I mean
[00:20:16.700 --> 00:20:22.300]   I think they netted an extra six million dollars that's according to the federal indictment
[00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:29.980]   in that case but yeah I mean if you give a CEO a million shares and you back date it
[00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:35.900]   so that it's worth you know it was at a price ten dollars lower that's ten million dollars
[00:20:35.900 --> 00:20:36.900]   like extra.
[00:20:36.900 --> 00:20:41.100]   Now again you have to remember a lot of these options have to vest I mean I can't immediately
[00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:43.100]   exercise.
[00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:48.420]   And that would be a tax issue for the employee who receives that if he's because he immediately
[00:20:48.420 --> 00:20:54.620]   gets income and it's a tax issue for the companies as well because up until the Sarbanes Oxley
[00:20:54.620 --> 00:21:01.700]   Act in 2002 a company didn't have to expense options that were granted at what's known
[00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:06.780]   as fair market value in other words that that day you approve it that's the date of
[00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:11.940]   the grant but if you back date it so that it actually has a value you were supposed
[00:21:11.940 --> 00:21:16.860]   to expense that and that's why many companies are now having to restate their earnings
[00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:18.820]   and it's a real mess.
[00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:23.900]   So that's the gap that we're arguing about it's not that the board didn't approve the
[00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:26.940]   slush fund of without whenever option.
[00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:32.500]   There's different cases again but I mean just another example for the effect on shareholders
[00:21:32.500 --> 00:21:36.940]   I forget the name of the company but there was one company that's already spent seventy
[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:43.020]   million dollars on its investigation and restatement of its earnings because you have to bring in
[00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:49.240]   teams of lawyers and along with the accountants and that itself is very expensive and you
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:51.860]   wouldn't have had to do that if it was done properly.
[00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:52.860]   Follow the rules.
[00:21:52.860 --> 00:21:53.860]   Yeah.
[00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:58.260]   Another story Randall brought to us from actually this is via the IP mailing list the interesting
[00:21:58.260 --> 00:22:01.620]   people mailing list Dave Farber sent this out.
[00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:04.020]   Kind of a great story I think good news for the good guys.
[00:22:04.020 --> 00:22:08.780]   Yeah it's really interesting I've been following this story for a while apparently Logan Airport
[00:22:08.780 --> 00:22:14.460]   has a four pay Wi-Fi service where you have to pay some amount maybe range to T-Mobile
[00:22:14.460 --> 00:22:20.340]   or somebody but Continental Airlines was offering a free Wi-Fi service in their lounge
[00:22:20.340 --> 00:22:25.660]   for their customers and Logan came along and said you can't set this equipment up because
[00:22:25.660 --> 00:22:28.140]   it interferes with our equipment.
[00:22:28.140 --> 00:22:29.780]   Interferes with our right to make money.
[00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:34.260]   That's really a bottom line but they were claiming that because they were the property
[00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:41.100]   holder that they had the ability to control the wireless the unlicensed band well licensed
[00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:45.580]   in a broad way band of what Wi-Fi is they had they claimed that they had the right to
[00:22:45.580 --> 00:22:50.940]   control that and it was clearly seen as just a money grab but the larger more important
[00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:55.820]   issue is you know what really are the rights that someone has to broadcast and receive
[00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:58.180]   in these so-called unlicensed bands.
[00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:00.340]   So what did the FCC rule?
[00:23:00.340 --> 00:23:04.740]   In the recent posting apparently the FCC did in fact side with Continental they said that
[00:23:04.740 --> 00:23:09.420]   Continental had the right to set up their own wireless as long as they were complying
[00:23:09.420 --> 00:23:14.940]   with the FCC's rules in other words the FCC claimed a jurisdiction over the wire the Wi-Fi
[00:23:14.940 --> 00:23:16.660]   signals in that building.
[00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:20.620]   And there are actually very few rules over this 2.4 gigahertz band that's an unregulated
[00:23:20.620 --> 00:23:22.700]   band that's why Wi-Fi is on that band in the first place.
[00:23:22.700 --> 00:23:28.500]   Yeah this is a really important ruling I think because it re-establishes the FCC's role in
[00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:33.660]   a positive way to say look we set the rules here and everybody has to play by our rules
[00:23:33.660 --> 00:23:39.260]   whether you like them or not and you don't get to make up private rules for your building.
[00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:40.340]   This would also have implications.
[00:23:40.340 --> 00:23:44.900]   That's important building so if you're a renter and you rented an apartment complex
[00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:48.100]   in the apartment then the landlord said no no we've got our own Wi-Fi which you have
[00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:51.060]   to buy you set up your own they can't stop you.
[00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:55.700]   Exactly this is important for that yes because what this means then is that you know I could
[00:23:55.700 --> 00:24:00.740]   as a person that wants to help out the fellow renters in my corner of the building I could
[00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:06.420]   set up a Wi-Fi port and within the realm of course of my agreement with the who provides
[00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:10.740]   my data service I could share stuff for my corner of the building and the landlord can't
[00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:14.500]   say anything about that even if it interferes with their stuff as long as I'm complying
[00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:18.340]   with the FCC's rules about it the landlord can't say anything that's what this case says.
[00:24:18.340 --> 00:24:24.260]   You know how much like this is phone if you've been following this Spanish company F-O-N
[00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:29.380]   the whole idea is they are offering like three dollar five dollar something like that access
[00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:34.460]   points but only if you agree to make it an open access point so that other people can
[00:24:34.460 --> 00:24:39.180]   then use it and they want to build basically it and network worldwide network of free open
[00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:43.780]   access via these phone access points I presume they make some money on it.
[00:24:43.780 --> 00:24:46.660]   Well I say good luck if they're going to be doing that in the US I think most of the
[00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:50.060]   carriers in the US are basically said no that's in their terms of service.
[00:24:50.060 --> 00:24:53.340]   Yeah we also have a company like I called Linksys that ships all their routers that's
[00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:54.340]   open network networks.
[00:24:54.340 --> 00:24:56.940]   Somebody said Linksys is the number one I ask you.
[00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:57.940]   Exactly.
[00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:02.260]   I mean the moment I checked into a hotel the first thing I do is say okay Linksys Linksys
[00:25:02.260 --> 00:25:05.580]   is one of these three I'm not going to use instead of paying twenty dollars a night.
[00:25:05.580 --> 00:25:10.300]   Well now there was a case in Washington state where that was shown to be a potential damaging
[00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:11.300]   thing.
[00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:13.620]   Now this was an extreme case but this process is.
[00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:15.180]   Is Linksys liable?
[00:25:15.180 --> 00:25:19.980]   Not Linksys but there was apparently were some laws about data theft or whatever that
[00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:23.020]   were being implied in Washington state probably some of the laws that convicted me in Oregon
[00:25:23.020 --> 00:25:27.140]   but this guy got on was sitting in.
[00:25:27.140 --> 00:25:31.380]   You can't say that anymore because you're going to get expunged and then you'll be on
[00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:32.380]   record here.
[00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:35.700]   You'll erase your tapes this will all be edited out right.
[00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:37.340]   Tapes that's so inacridistic to tapes.
[00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:38.780]   I believe there's no tape.
[00:25:38.780 --> 00:25:39.940]   You feel old.
[00:25:39.940 --> 00:25:40.940]   Bits.
[00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:45.940]   But apparently this guy in Washington state was sitting in his car in the parking lot of
[00:25:45.940 --> 00:25:47.020]   something like a Starbucks.
[00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:48.020]   It was a coffee shop.
[00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:49.020]   Coffee shop.
[00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:52.220]   Yeah and so he's sitting in the parking lot and apparently after doing this for many
[00:25:52.220 --> 00:25:54.020]   days I forget the exact number of people.
[00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:55.020]   They asked him to move.
[00:25:55.020 --> 00:25:58.460]   Right and so he said he had the parking lot so to me it seems like a simple trespass
[00:25:58.460 --> 00:26:01.980]   issue that they could simply ask him to believe for trespassing but instead they invoked
[00:26:01.980 --> 00:26:06.700]   a computer crime law to get him prosecuted on the basis that he was also stealing the
[00:26:06.700 --> 00:26:07.700]   Wi-Fi service.
[00:26:07.700 --> 00:26:09.700]   Right and that's what's ridiculous.
[00:26:09.700 --> 00:26:12.980]   I mean I have to side with them from the point of view that if that parking space is being
[00:26:12.980 --> 00:26:16.220]   taken up by someone who's just buying them coffee McDonald's you know that's bad for their
[00:26:16.220 --> 00:26:17.220]   business but yeah right.
[00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:20.380]   That's what they said they said if he had just bought a coffee we wouldn't mind but he would
[00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:21.780]   just sit out there.
[00:26:21.780 --> 00:26:23.420]   It's buying coffee that's all we ask.
[00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:24.420]   A cup of day.
[00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:28.100]   Exactly and suddenly people have to be aware of that these big umbrellas are Wi-Fi that
[00:26:28.100 --> 00:26:31.980]   you know you don't have a reasonable, reasonable expectation that people are not going to find
[00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:33.180]   it and not going to be able to use it.
[00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:38.380]   As a matter of fact I met one of my new neighbors because I had a brand new access point in
[00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:39.660]   that was set up by the cable company.
[00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:43.180]   It was open for one day because I was out of town at the time and then so basically it
[00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:46.220]   sort of came in and put in a password and everything so I got an octon the door the next
[00:26:46.220 --> 00:26:48.260]   day I was like hi.
[00:26:48.260 --> 00:26:50.220]   The neighborhood internet access is down.
[00:26:50.220 --> 00:26:52.220]   You know what I'm talking about?
[00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:55.420]   My name is neighborhood internet access.
[00:26:55.420 --> 00:26:59.780]   But again because we have these mixed rules about it though it's very interesting to really
[00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:06.020]   say with some authority because of different case law whether it is really I mean I can
[00:27:06.020 --> 00:27:10.780]   tell you what I think is expected based on you know my idea which is it you know if it's
[00:27:10.780 --> 00:27:14.820]   not password protected it's not privacy protected you know you haven't taken the action to actually
[00:27:14.820 --> 00:27:16.060]   lock it up.
[00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:20.140]   But you know whatever analogy we come up with it's going to be not directly applicable but
[00:27:20.140 --> 00:27:22.940]   the problem is we got case law that's going both directions on this.
[00:27:22.940 --> 00:27:28.540]   But isn't part of the problem generational in nature almost everybody at this well we're
[00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:30.260]   all in our early 20s.
[00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:31.260]   Right.
[00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:32.260]   Absolutely.
[00:27:32.260 --> 00:27:33.260]   Yes.
[00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:34.260]   Yeah.
[00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:36.540]   You mentioned 20 hex or what we're like you know if there is a 40s but we're in our like
[00:27:36.540 --> 00:27:39.900]   we're in our teens and 20s and technological years okay which means that we essentially
[00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:42.860]   grew up understanding that well look these services are open these services are meant
[00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:46.660]   to be shared unless there's security on it that means that the implication is that yes
[00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:50.260]   you can go to this website and download this picture or download this content if we're
[00:27:50.260 --> 00:27:52.780]   password protected the owner would want it protected.
[00:27:52.780 --> 00:27:56.060]   Except if you're to that to somebody who's used to be you know walking up to a closed
[00:27:56.060 --> 00:27:58.020]   door rather than locked or it's still not going through.
[00:27:58.020 --> 00:28:00.140]   Yeah but the analogy breaks down.
[00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:01.140]   Right.
[00:28:01.140 --> 00:28:03.300]   Well I'm saying would you confront people who are from an earlier generation who believe
[00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:06.980]   that while it's cable TV that you plug into and you have to subscribe to doors and again
[00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:10.820]   you need a passkey to get into if I set the space station of course I'm not going to expect
[00:28:10.820 --> 00:28:13.980]   people to use it because they have to come in and pay for it.
[00:28:13.980 --> 00:28:19.220]   This so many things in this world are generational problems like that where it's so difficult
[00:28:19.220 --> 00:28:23.780]   to explain to kids that look if you don't pay for this CD yes it doesn't hurt you know
[00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:27.540]   it doesn't hurt do weasel zappa that you didn't buy it this one copy but again millions of
[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:30.900]   people that's a big problem but again you are raised with a concept that well if it's
[00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:35.100]   on the internet it's possible to simply download it you lose that sort of connection between
[00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:36.980]   monetization and content.
[00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:40.500]   Right and so many people who don't understand that there are layers of security to apply
[00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:43.940]   to their wifi device they plug their wifi device into their cable thing and that's great because
[00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:47.260]   they can carry their laptop around at home but they don't realize that anybody driving
[00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:50.780]   by parking on the street also has access to the very same internet connection and some
[00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:54.060]   people may not care and other people may think that there's you know that this doesn't
[00:28:54.060 --> 00:28:57.620]   implicate them anything but I tell you man the first day somebody sends spam using their
[00:28:57.620 --> 00:29:00.140]   wifi they're going to get they're going to accuse their problem.
[00:29:00.140 --> 00:29:02.700]   It's even worse than that when people are downloading music through an open point where
[00:29:02.700 --> 00:29:07.300]   people are doing extremely more offensive and more illegal things via an open point that
[00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:11.220]   the first time you get a knock on your door saying hi your internet access point was
[00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:15.540]   used to transmit this thrust in your face boy does reality hit you like a ton of bricks
[00:29:15.540 --> 00:29:16.540]   at that point.
[00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:19.100]   And I also really wouldn't mind sharing my internet connection with people around me
[00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:22.100]   when I'm not at home which is frequent enough because I want all these cruises and stuff
[00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:26.500]   but when I am at home I kind of want it to be mine so you know there's that kind of
[00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:27.500]   adjustment to it.
[00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:31.460]   So you think phone is hopeless this whole business plan is well I mean it might work
[00:29:31.460 --> 00:29:35.940]   for where they're installing it where they don't have a broader infrastructure where that
[00:29:35.940 --> 00:29:37.820]   might be the only way that people can come home.
[00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:41.380]   Is it utopian I mean a lot of people have proposed we'll just keep these open access
[00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:42.380]   points.
[00:29:42.380 --> 00:29:47.060]   Let's make a giant mesh network across the entire country as a table full people who
[00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:50.340]   spend eight dollars per minute in internet access for the past week on board ship.
[00:29:50.340 --> 00:29:52.460]   Yes I'm all for a big match.
[00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:54.900]   Can it reach out to the Caribbean?
[00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:55.900]   Right.
[00:29:55.900 --> 00:29:59.140]   Especially now that we all have VPN technology and we can essentially make a message.
[00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:00.340]   We can protect ourselves within that.
[00:30:00.340 --> 00:30:03.500]   Exactly if we are if we care to be secure we can simply drop our own bubble of our own
[00:30:03.500 --> 00:30:05.820]   tunnel of secure connection to wherever we want.
[00:30:05.820 --> 00:30:09.860]   Of course then we need more people to die and we've replaced by more tech savvy people
[00:30:09.860 --> 00:30:13.100]   to understand that those things are both are both are easy to use and necessary.
[00:30:13.100 --> 00:30:17.380]   But the problem is that when there's free internet service provided we have a problem
[00:30:17.380 --> 00:30:18.860]   of a chain of accountability.
[00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:19.860]   Exactly.
[00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:22.580]   Because if we have people that can just sign up for free and don't have to have an agreement
[00:30:22.580 --> 00:30:25.940]   of some kind with the extra center of the EUP of some kind then we have the problem
[00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:30.140]   with you know spam and child pornography and file sharing that comes through these ports.
[00:30:30.140 --> 00:30:33.860]   It's the same reason I argued and sort of against all my friends I say city will file
[00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:36.940]   city my metro provided Wi-Fi is the bad deal.
[00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:39.140]   It's definitely going to be a bad deal all the way around.
[00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:44.420]   And because if if if metro provided free Wi-Fi allows me as just an average citizen to walk
[00:30:44.420 --> 00:30:48.700]   up and start sending spam and start downloading child pornography or file sharing there's
[00:30:48.700 --> 00:30:52.060]   no accountability the city will actually become liable for some of those things.
[00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:54.500]   And once the city becomes liable for some of those things soccer moms are going to come
[00:30:54.500 --> 00:30:58.180]   in and say my kid was downloading pornography out there in the parking lot we've got to
[00:30:58.180 --> 00:31:01.060]   listen we just shut this down which means filters will go in which means there won't
[00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:06.900]   be any any actually unfiltered service which means all we'll have is a city subsidized
[00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:10.420]   service and there won't be an opportunity to compete with a professional service or a
[00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:13.860]   paid for service because once you take away the bottom tier of customers there's not enough
[00:31:13.860 --> 00:31:17.020]   income at the next tier up to provide for an internet service.
[00:31:17.020 --> 00:31:20.700]   So you lose competition you have a problem with accountability and soccer moms are going
[00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:22.460]   to be controlling it and it's going to be lawsuits forever.
[00:31:22.460 --> 00:31:24.820]   So you have censorship versus accountability.
[00:31:24.820 --> 00:31:25.820]   Exactly.
[00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:26.820]   It's just a huge issue.
[00:31:26.820 --> 00:31:28.380]   But not your Wi-Fi is a bad deal.
[00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:29.380]   I don't know why people are so...
[00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:31.340]   Well those are all good points.
[00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:33.380]   I'm not sure if it's an either or proposition.
[00:31:33.380 --> 00:31:37.220]   I think that one of the best ways to jumpstart development in a lot of communities is to
[00:31:37.220 --> 00:31:41.460]   say well look what if we were to say that everybody will get not really good broad then
[00:31:41.460 --> 00:31:45.020]   not really good at Wi-Fi access but simply a reduced one that's good enough for us.
[00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:46.940]   That's what Google's doing in San Francisco.
[00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:48.340]   It's 300 kilobits access.
[00:31:48.340 --> 00:31:51.820]   It's kind of not to just you know you still would want to get a commercial.
[00:31:51.820 --> 00:31:56.620]   That sounds to me like a great setup for a two-tiered toll road non net neutral.
[00:31:56.620 --> 00:32:00.340]   Okay but again I've got five different ways of accessing the internet.
[00:32:00.340 --> 00:32:02.140]   I don't think you're a professional.
[00:32:02.140 --> 00:32:05.300]   Well no no no I'm not a new journalist in the United States of America.
[00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:07.300]   I'm a huge usual citizen.
[00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:08.300]   Whenever whenever.
[00:32:08.300 --> 00:32:11.700]   Okay I won't deny that.
[00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:16.780]   But the thing is every time I've had an internet access method that fell short in some way
[00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:18.940]   for shape or form be it speed, be it reliability.
[00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:22.300]   I've either gotten a find a different service be it DSL be it whatever else.
[00:32:22.300 --> 00:32:25.100]   If you kept the old version or simply cancel the contract.
[00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:28.380]   I think that what we wanted to defend against is the idea that there is one way to get on
[00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:30.180]   the internet and that way sucks.
[00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:31.180]   I would agree with that.
[00:32:31.180 --> 00:32:32.860]   Again but you're much more savvy about this than most people.
[00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:33.860]   But again but again.
[00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:34.860]   And not everybody has choices.
[00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:35.860]   I mean that's where you run into troubles.
[00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:40.660]   Somebody has one or maybe two choices and both of them are gated communities.
[00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:45.620]   I think the problem that they're trying to address really though is the idea of informational
[00:32:45.620 --> 00:32:48.140]   haves and informational have nots.
[00:32:48.140 --> 00:32:49.540]   And that there is some no no no no.
[00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:51.700]   Well you have not if you have a 300 kilobits access.
[00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:52.700]   It may not be as fast.
[00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:53.700]   Exactly.
[00:32:53.700 --> 00:32:55.700]   No access you have not.
[00:32:55.700 --> 00:32:56.700]   That's exactly right.
[00:32:56.700 --> 00:33:00.740]   And that's where municipalities might have a certainly an interest in stepping in at least
[00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:01.740]   providing minimal access.
[00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:05.180]   It's cheaper than I think some of these municipalities intend to charge.
[00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:07.740]   I mean they're going to act as a provider.
[00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:09.140]   I think Philadelphia for example.
[00:33:09.140 --> 00:33:10.140]   First one's free.
[00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:11.140]   It's not free.
[00:33:11.140 --> 00:33:12.140]   Oh interesting.
[00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:13.140]   Yeah.
[00:33:13.140 --> 00:33:14.140]   And that's of course Philadelphia was the one that got everybody.
[00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:15.140]   Right.
[00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:18.700]   But I think my understanding is they want a lower cost to internet access than.
[00:33:18.700 --> 00:33:20.340]   I think Toronto is doing the same thing.
[00:33:20.340 --> 00:33:22.540]   Toronto Hydro is currently free but it plans to charge.
[00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:26.980]   They may exempt certain people below a certain income level.
[00:33:26.980 --> 00:33:29.900]   I think free makes sense in the sense that it's community development.
[00:33:29.900 --> 00:33:32.140]   If you want to bring business to a community.
[00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:35.180]   I mean it's good for the community if you do it in a tier.
[00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:41.180]   I mean look Google has the capability to do this both technically and to monetize it
[00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:44.540]   because they certainly have ways to make money on free internet.
[00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:46.300]   Providing advertising holds.
[00:33:46.300 --> 00:33:47.300]   Exactly.
[00:33:47.300 --> 00:33:49.700]   And I'll be very interested to see how it goes in San Francisco where their pilot project
[00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:51.340]   is.
[00:33:51.340 --> 00:33:54.060]   That's a model that could go worldwide and work.
[00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:56.620]   But will it go over in Poughkeepsie?
[00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:59.540]   And then the problem again still though is even with Google setup there's still accountability.
[00:33:59.540 --> 00:34:02.820]   If anybody can walk up at the laptop then how do we lock that one out?
[00:34:02.820 --> 00:34:04.900]   I mean you could choose a Mac address by typing a command.
[00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:07.300]   So I think Google can solve that one.
[00:34:07.300 --> 00:34:08.980]   Yeah that sounds like a detail.
[00:34:08.980 --> 00:34:13.220]   But I think the goal for everybody to go for is diversity of species.
[00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:15.380]   I mean again I want really.
[00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:16.380]   Everything.
[00:34:16.380 --> 00:34:17.380]   Exactly.
[00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:22.780]   I'm offended by the idea of a highly regulated and censored net but if somebody wants to buy
[00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:26.020]   a net access that where a central computer will look at every single address and make
[00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:31.060]   sure nothing naughty, nothing illegal, nothing but pure as a driven snow and then bowing to
[00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:33.580]   the cow tower the right political correct political party.
[00:34:33.580 --> 00:34:34.580]   Of the moment.
[00:34:34.580 --> 00:34:35.580]   Exactly.
[00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:38.620]   If they want to buy that service I think that's a great idea that they can get that
[00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:39.620]   sort of thing.
[00:34:39.620 --> 00:34:43.660]   Again it's not good for them and they're broadening their knowledge base but if everybody can
[00:34:43.660 --> 00:34:47.100]   get the exact sort of internet service that they want that's exactly the best interest
[00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:48.100]   of humanity.
[00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:49.100]   I'm not against many Wi-Fi.
[00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:52.220]   Yeah I'm not against many Wi-Fi as long as it doesn't upset the free market enough
[00:34:52.220 --> 00:34:56.980]   that there can't be alternatives and as long as there aren't enough dollars wasted on setting
[00:34:56.980 --> 00:34:59.460]   up a system that eventually gets shut down because of First Amendment problems.
[00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:00.460]   Exactly.
[00:35:00.460 --> 00:35:02.780]   In my community I had to give a very long, I had to restrain myself in real life because
[00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:07.020]   realizing I'm not talking to people that are used to talking to the emotion of geeks because
[00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:12.340]   the cable company, they wanted to give them exclusive delivery of broadband internet access.
[00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:16.860]   I said bad, bad, bad idea because think about all the auditors you've had and think of
[00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:20.700]   running a business that now cannot get processed invoices or do you think-
[00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:22.340]   I mean exclusive like there's no DSL.
[00:35:22.340 --> 00:35:23.340]   No DSL right.
[00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:26.820]   They thought that it wasn't because they're stupid it's because they were simply ignorant
[00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:27.820]   about what that imply.
[00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:28.820]   Right.
[00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:32.300]   Basically they're going to add another couple pages to the contract they had with nameless
[00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:35.540]   evil rat, rat cable system.
[00:35:35.540 --> 00:35:38.340]   And so they said well you know we already have an exclusive on cable content.
[00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:39.820]   What if we simply- Data as well.
[00:35:39.820 --> 00:35:42.700]   We'll wire up your entire community for this and we're like you know we got to make sure
[00:35:42.700 --> 00:35:44.860]   that if someone guy wants to come up with optical he can do that.
[00:35:44.860 --> 00:35:46.820]   We want to make sure that it won't be illegal for me.
[00:35:46.820 --> 00:35:48.140]   We need to put in a mini dish and get some.
[00:35:48.140 --> 00:35:51.380]   I think it's very tempting to submit this palace because the cable companies come in.
[00:35:51.380 --> 00:35:53.740]   I've been on the tech committee from I mean small town.
[00:35:53.740 --> 00:35:56.060]   They come in and offer them the sun and the moon.
[00:35:56.060 --> 00:35:59.300]   They never give it, they never deliver but once they get that contract it's awfully hard
[00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:01.540]   for ten years they're in combat and it's very hard to-
[00:36:01.540 --> 00:36:04.820]   And to be fair when you're trying to figure out how to hire two more teachers that you
[00:36:04.820 --> 00:36:05.820]   desperately need.
[00:36:05.820 --> 00:36:09.780]   Someone wants to give you you know 800,000 dollars for the free infrastructure.
[00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:11.700]   You have to have a good reason to say no.
[00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:14.340]   You know there's an interesting and I'm not online so I'm not going to be able to quote
[00:36:14.340 --> 00:36:15.340]   this exactly.
[00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:20.780]   Any of you gone into an airplane or many other places and looked at access points and found
[00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:23.500]   free public Wi-Fi?
[00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:24.500]   Free public hotspot?
[00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:25.500]   I've seen that.
[00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:26.500]   Yeah.
[00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:29.780]   You'll see it on planes even and of course there's no internet access on it and somebody
[00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:32.580]   called my radio show and asked me about it and I said boy I don't know but I sure wouldn't
[00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:35.940]   get on anything that said free public Wi-Fi and didn't have anything else at the other
[00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:36.940]   end.
[00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:39.980]   I mean there's all sorts of- it turns out it's a flaw in windows.
[00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:40.980]   The weight there.
[00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:41.980]   What a surprise.
[00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:42.980]   Oh shocker that.
[00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:45.540]   It's a case care of all this right.
[00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:46.540]   What happened in this?
[00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:48.540]   Risto will never happen.
[00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:49.540]   Risto will never happen.
[00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:55.020]   Apparently if you select it's essentially kind of a virally spread.
[00:36:55.020 --> 00:37:00.940]   Windows infrastructure, not infrastructure, ad hoc Wi-Fi networking will remember the
[00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:05.700]   last ad hoc point you were on and somehow creates this ad hoc point.
[00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:10.260]   So somebody somewhere got on something called free public Wi-Fi and it's now propagating
[00:37:10.260 --> 00:37:14.260]   and you'll see it on planes you'll start the flight there'll be one you get off the
[00:37:14.260 --> 00:37:18.740]   flight there's ten and then it spreads from there so just watch you'll see a lot of these
[00:37:18.740 --> 00:37:23.540]   free public Wi-Fi and there's nothing on the other end because it's an ad hoc network.
[00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:24.540]   Is it dangerous?
[00:37:24.540 --> 00:37:25.540]   It's not dangerous.
[00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:28.500]   Well it is if they've got viruses of some kind that could infect your machine.
[00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:29.900]   Well that's sort of a given right?
[00:37:29.900 --> 00:37:30.900]   Yeah it's a good point.
[00:37:30.900 --> 00:37:33.140]   It's not dangerous to you because you're using a Mac.
[00:37:33.140 --> 00:37:36.060]   There's a way to sell if the machine has viruses and spyware look for an apple.
[00:37:36.060 --> 00:37:38.340]   The windows logo on the front of the car.
[00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:42.740]   A couple of apple stories in the news first of all the new shuffle finally ships.
[00:37:42.740 --> 00:37:46.300]   Shuffle ships we've been waiting for the shuffle it's the that's the little one that's
[00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:49.900]   just basically the size of the clip that you got with the old iPod.
[00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:51.820]   So long before the bikinio is that coming out next?
[00:37:51.820 --> 00:37:54.780]   I think that is what I saw it I thought this is a Saturday Night Live's kit.
[00:37:54.780 --> 00:38:02.500]   It's a little late but it's out and I think the way they're positioning is it's not your
[00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:03.500]   first iPod.
[00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:07.100]   It might not even be your second iPod it's your third or fourth iPod right it's the
[00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:08.100]   extra.
[00:38:08.100 --> 00:38:12.300]   Really why do you want to carry that the big four ounce iPod into the basket with you?
[00:38:12.300 --> 00:38:13.300]   Right.
[00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:15.540]   One flipped onto the flesh hand or the hopper and you're good to go.
[00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:17.180]   Have you seen them have you played with them?
[00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:22.300]   Yeah I play with one very in a very brief at the intro and it really it's it is exactly
[00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:27.740]   what apple does best just give you something that you you put in your hand it feels right.
[00:38:27.740 --> 00:38:31.440]   Apple is very good at creating and I'm you know I'm a little propagandized now because
[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:37.520]   Ben Long who's on the ships gave me these old BBC documentaries talking about Edward
[00:38:37.520 --> 00:38:42.160]   Bernays and the fact and the creation of public relations and what Edward Bernays who was
[00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:47.280]   the nephew of a Sigmund Freud figured out at the turn of the century was in at that time
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:51.200]   all advertising was based on on on value.
[00:38:51.200 --> 00:38:53.720]   You know here's what's going to do for you here that's how I'm going to help you and
[00:38:53.720 --> 00:38:56.680]   Edward Bernays said wait a minute that's the wrong way you got to speak to people's deep
[00:38:56.680 --> 00:39:01.600]   rooted subconscious feelings of need.
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:07.240]   You sell the need and so that's what Apple is so good at you don't need another iPod
[00:39:07.240 --> 00:39:11.560]   but you look at that you hold it and you go I want that.
[00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:16.840]   That's yeah there's two there's two things that go into marketing you're either creating
[00:39:16.840 --> 00:39:22.240]   demand or filling demand so we have a situation on the boat where the you know the Purell
[00:39:22.240 --> 00:39:27.800]   a go-go you know every room you go into they've got Purell that's that's filling a need right
[00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:31.320]   what happens otherwise we'll all get sick and die and they're pushing the Purell baby
[00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:35.880]   let me tell you I have never been anywhere what I've been so so sterile I have I I've
[00:39:35.880 --> 00:39:39.480]   I've absorbed more alcohol my bloodstream through my hands and I have to one year of
[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:43.320]   through my mouth don't you think I mean this is not a medical podcast but just briefly
[00:39:43.320 --> 00:39:46.520]   and we'll go back to your point but don't you think that by doing that we're creating
[00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:50.600]   a super breed of bacteria that's Purell resistance it's a shipboard breed maybe that's
[00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:55.080]   our job here on earth maybe God put us here because he needs to know it's plastic they'll
[00:39:55.080 --> 00:40:00.640]   be replacing Norwalk with Norwalk and and plastics plastic is a wonderful culture medium
[00:40:00.640 --> 00:40:05.480]   for bacteria indeed it is so you're saying it is really amazing I mean that's based marketing
[00:40:05.480 --> 00:40:09.360]   and they sell you they sell you a fabulous manicure when you get on the ship and then they
[00:40:09.360 --> 00:40:15.680]   completely ruin it by giving you Purell and with that they'll need based or what that
[00:40:15.680 --> 00:40:20.400]   right it's it's create the need to get the manicure and it's fill the need to do the
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:26.840]   Purell but Apple's very good at at creating a need and and looking at a situation where
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:33.480]   I'm in print need and you know and another I quote well do you need a pet rock I mean
[00:40:33.480 --> 00:40:37.600]   another way of looking at it is that they don't market to existing markets they basically
[00:40:37.600 --> 00:40:41.480]   say well look what are people how do people want to use us now the fact that there are
[00:40:41.480 --> 00:40:45.360]   now a million different ways to slip an iPod on your shoulder and your shoulder into your
[00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:48.960]   hat into whatever means that well how about one that has an integrated clip you can essentially
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:51.680]   put it on whatever piece of clothing you're wearing it's great for writers right exactly
[00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:56.320]   I mean I you see it you see my God that's so that's such a natural and good idea I think
[00:40:56.320 --> 00:41:01.000]   there's a certain fetish quality and Apple products as well maybe we're just the I mean
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.240]   everybody in this room these Mac mania crew look these guys spent thousands of dollars to
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:10.120]   sit here and talk about Mac and Tasha's so this is probably the best that's not the best
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:13.840]   test group but don't you think Apple creates these fetish objects that you don't need
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:17.320]   look I look at the Macbook Pro the one that just came out I don't need another laptop
[00:41:17.320 --> 00:41:23.440]   but I want one the word need with the word demand created demand yeah right and created
[00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:28.360]   imaginary need create a emotional need yeah but but isn't isn't that in some way part of
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:32.600]   the feature set of any piece of technology in any product I've been Nikon oh it is but
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:36.320]   Apple's particularly good at I'm saying that to get off Apple for just for a second just
[00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:40.120]   so we're not talking about one company Nikon let me a D80 for the past couple weeks I'm
[00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:43.640]   reviewing and of course of course I make sure I had it for the crews and part of it is yes
[00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:48.040]   has great features yes it takes great pictures but it feels exactly right in my hands has
[00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:54.480]   exact right F the buttons are don't you need this don't you want this is there a demand
[00:41:54.480 --> 00:41:58.360]   for that I mean that's what I don't think there has to be a demand and that's the point
[00:41:58.360 --> 00:42:05.080]   is there a dim this is it this is an HD this is an HD solid state camcorder this is my gadget
[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:10.040]   well actually well section for a while no it's a half an hour on a 2 gig SD card watch
[00:42:10.040 --> 00:42:14.360]   I'm gonna create a need right here create a need to get another one because it's going
[00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:21.000]   to my pocket if I lick this not having much my teeth you're not gonna want it back to
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.880]   not lick the camera well but again it does come down to perceive need because I believe
[00:42:25.880 --> 00:42:30.120]   or not I still do not own a camcorder that you can plug in via firewire because I hate
[00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:34.520]   camcorders I hate having one I hate having to treat video with one and so whenever I will
[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:38.000]   take one for a month and review them they'll talk to people using every day to make sure
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.640]   that my knowledge is up to date but as as wonderful as this is and this is a really
[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:46.680]   cool compelling object I'm holding I should say it's the Sanio exacty HD 1A it's a solid
[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:50.480]   state camcorder and it basically looks like a not not the phasers from the first series
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:53.920]   of Star Trek but from the second week series yeah yeah when it was more of a peacekeeping
[00:42:53.920 --> 00:42:59.720]   phaser than anything else but a phaser sent to nap it's more I think marketing is more
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:04.080]   like hypnotism than mind control because you can't hypnotize people into doing something
[00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:08.360]   they wouldn't do ordinarily so you can't really you can't market me to buy something
[00:43:08.360 --> 00:43:15.200]   well I'll give you an example here's an example this bottled water this is a created need
[00:43:15.200 --> 00:43:20.880]   you can go into the tap and get free water okay okay but here's what happened marketers
[00:43:20.880 --> 00:43:24.920]   noticed all of a sudden a lot of people going around with these sport bottles and they said
[00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:28.880]   hmm there's a market here why don't we just portability sell portability why don't we
[00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:33.440]   just sell this water this way now how much what's the markup on this water more than gasoline
[00:43:33.440 --> 00:43:36.560]   it's the same price as the stupid sodas I mean they're selling them roughly the same
[00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:41.160]   price but is that a real need or is that a created real need because why go go to put
[00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:45.400]   remember what water tastes in a public school you know do you know what's do you know what
[00:43:45.400 --> 00:43:48.800]   the set of the pipe is do I live in the Pacific Northwest my water in the Pacific Northwest
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:52.840]   is great that's your water for the first you open your mouth every second it's been raining
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:56.680]   so hard exactly the range comes right down it's like natural I really think it's not
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:00.120]   so much marketing as again people not only that but people are more aware of the need
[00:44:00.120 --> 00:44:02.640]   that they need to hydrate that the reason why they're feeling so terrible up the end of
[00:44:02.640 --> 00:44:06.400]   the two days is because they've drunk maybe you know two cups of non caffeinated whatever
[00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:11.200]   it is I like the fact that again if I want to hydrate but every store will give me a
[00:44:11.200 --> 00:44:15.520]   ball a ball water with no caffeine no chemicals no calories nothing but hydration and no corn
[00:44:15.520 --> 00:44:20.440]   syrup I mean it's really for people who are moving away from so there are there are many
[00:44:20.440 --> 00:44:26.600]   documented cases of bottled water that's bottled with municipal tap water or in some
[00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:30.400]   cases you know what shows you how which shows you how good the tap water is supposed to be
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:34.040]   if they if they meet meet requirements but if bottled water doesn't even match me
[00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:38.840]   this but standards for water quality why are you paying for that well that's that's
[00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:42.600]   the question okay because there isn't a stream anywhere near coffee square in Boston
[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:47.160]   it's a trust issue rather there's the public trust this company there and ducks are doing
[00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:51.520]   things that I don't approve of this water comes with slayer this is trustworthy water
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:54.880]   right I don't want to brag or anything but I got a dollar on me right now I'm going to
[00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:58.760]   make another dollar really really quickly in my job so I can spend a dollar to get you know
[00:44:58.760 --> 00:45:04.600]   a leader not a leader 20 hours wait a minute it's bingo time let's listen in
[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:09.040]   and they figured off notalays and gentlemen from this York captain speaking bit of voice
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:14.320]   from the bridge the voice of the bridge information whatever you choose to do make it a great
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:20.160]   action ending on the v-dam and I'll see you around the ship no that's anybody ever seen
[00:45:20.160 --> 00:45:25.720]   this guy yes not around the ship not around the ship but he's on the closed circuit all
[00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:29.000]   right that's a tactical error the least thing you want to do given that we're at sea where
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:32.680]   he's trapped on board with fifty hundred people who want to hurt him really badly I'll
[00:45:32.680 --> 00:45:37.080]   see you I would I would have a max headroom sort of thing go in my place that's almost
[00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:44.280]   just gonna say I carry twenty grand on me at all times can we talk about that wasniak
[00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:49.520]   I'm gonna have to email that boy Steve wasniak who was gonna be on this cruise I think but
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:53.920]   his book came out a little bit late and so he's on a book tour still and part of the
[00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:57.120]   talk of the cruises wasniak's appearance on Colbert and the vote on whether he whether
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:46:03.160]   it was abysmal horrible or just plain embarrassing but the other thing he did is he gave an interview
[00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:08.560]   you heard this name yeah what happened he he he basically told everybody he carries he
[00:46:08.560 --> 00:46:13.400]   likes cash and he carries twenty k on him at all times I'm guessing that's not gonna
[00:46:13.400 --> 00:46:18.400]   happen for long no that it seems like a dumb thing to admit that's right it's it's it's
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:24.120]   a pretty large audience so on Colbert he says I carry a credit card size knife that I can
[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:30.280]   cut my stake with and now he's actually actually bigger than that his standard business card
[00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:34.600]   is a sharp piece of square metal that is apparently sharp enough to cut a stake with
[00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:41.640]   wow I like to demonstrate this for sure oh I guess here have my cards my theory is that
[00:46:41.640 --> 00:46:45.240]   after your net worth exceeds three hundred let's say four hundred billion dollars to give
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:48.920]   you a special security social security number that's like the black American Express card
[00:46:48.920 --> 00:46:52.480]   when you pay for the black card then give them whatever he wants do whatever he wants
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:55.920]   he's black card anything you want right so so when the FBI you know get runs it back
[00:46:55.920 --> 00:46:59.280]   run check when he gets pulled over for whatever they say oh you've got the double Y in front
[00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:03.240]   of the so okay that means you're so rich you can buy our way out of anything so go on
[00:47:03.240 --> 00:47:06.240]   your way thank you very much sorry to have trouble you sir didn't know Jay have one of
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:13.360]   those who oh Jay oh but I you know he's he's he's got to be one of the sweetest guys that's
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:18.760]   ever been on the wall absolutely and and he's got every gizmo's like a child I think really
[00:47:18.760 --> 00:47:24.360]   that's the problem with the with the co-barre parents was just that the the cardinal rule
[00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:28.680]   of appearing on that kind of a comedy show is let the host be funny and he was trying
[00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:33.440]   to tell stories and just expecting co-barre to be very patient and simply use it and enjoy
[00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:37.240]   the stories oh there's not a straight man exactly and so he's he's done that long and
[00:47:37.240 --> 00:47:42.720]   you're aware though that was has posted that whole video on his own website so he feels
[00:47:42.720 --> 00:47:47.440]   pretty good about it must yeah I saw it I didn't think see anybody who knows was and
[00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:51.640]   watched that said that's why that's how he is so I think that that among his circle of
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:55.440]   family and friends it's just like mom was was right somebody who doesn't know was might
[00:47:55.440 --> 00:48:00.240]   walk look at it and say well out yeah but there's so many executives in this industry
[00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:04.880]   too which that would be true yeah I mean we'd rather have something about coupon we'd
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:08.720]   rather have the so-called crazy you know crazy like rich businessman who like cuts his
[00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:13.640]   stake on his on his on a flight with a business card or the crazy CEO who spends 4.8 million
[00:48:13.640 --> 00:48:17.000]   dollars on a birthday party for his dog it's a very much stealing money from the company
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:19.960]   that's a good that's a good kind of crazy and a bad kind of no body ever back dated
[00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:24.080]   any options to Steve was yeah I can tell you that right now they would he would have shared
[00:48:24.080 --> 00:48:29.440]   him yeah he would have given him away so uh apple shared a document that might wish at
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:35.420]   this point it didn't share this was downloaded according to the uh unofficial apple web log
[00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:42.420]   t u a w it's our support your local union support the two of w today I like it look for
[00:48:42.420 --> 00:48:49.320]   the union log they released apple released for download to in its developer section ipods
[00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:56.000]   notes feature guide in which I'm quoting uh it says all other notes feature capabilities
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:00.580]   described in this document are supported for ipod models with display screens beginning
[00:49:00.580 --> 00:49:06.600]   with the touch screen models whoops oh the what the touch screen models now this just
[00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:13.040]   came out on october 20th so this is a small piece of text inside another document or
[00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:17.080]   is a small piece of text it's an it's a kind of highlighted note as you can see right
[00:49:17.080 --> 00:49:22.080]   here right and it sounds to me like absolute confirmation in it verton that apple has a
[00:49:22.080 --> 00:49:27.360]   touch screen model coming out or is this or or was planning to at that time well october
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:31.740]   20th is came out it's pretty recent yeah that's a tipping the hand again sounds to me like
[00:49:31.740 --> 00:49:35.580]   that's a that's an admission is there any way you could say it was else you think it's
[00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:41.060]   just a mistake or documentation somebody told me it was a typo they meant uh i don't
[00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:45.700]   know what they meant touch screens where is like touch that's only a typo away tough
[00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:51.300]   screen tell me you know sometimes you know you don't have a think oh and when you type
[00:49:51.300 --> 00:49:54.340]   the word you did not intend to type even though it's a perfectly good word and micro software
[00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:58.520]   doesn't tell you hey don't you think somebody vets this though and a few people looked at
[00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:02.680]   this it sounds to me more like it was a document that wasn't intended to be released until
[00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:09.560]   a few weeks hence or or maybe mac world i mean isn't that we don't know when some have
[00:50:09.560 --> 00:50:13.920]   said that uh... december that the touch read'll come out in order in order to get any sense
[00:50:13.920 --> 00:50:17.280]   well we really for only one reason to preempt the zoom
[00:50:17.280 --> 00:50:21.300]   uh... the zoom the zoom is probably gonna preempt itself
[00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:26.760]   i mean microsoft microsoft's invented the self-preempting that gadget i really i really don't see them
[00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:31.440]   doing it doing a touch group introducing such a major new ipod without enough time to sell
[00:50:31.440 --> 00:50:36.280]   a bottle of them for in time for christmas the are overdue for release though that's very
[00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:40.100]   true i would have been i was a little surprised when seeing that big in october could have
[00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:43.460]   been technical issues or production issues kept them from releasing in october but they're
[00:50:43.460 --> 00:50:46.320]   trying to get it out as quickly as they can there's so many different reasons why every
[00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:50.440]   time i talk to somebody post to the post is this incident that's why how come this didn't
[00:50:50.440 --> 00:50:54.340]   ship in time it ranges from we thought there was a feature that we thought was integral
[00:50:54.340 --> 00:50:57.680]   but some of the side we need to get rid of it and so we had a hold it back for a couple
[00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:01.900]   months somebody inside with with apple said this there are people people who sometimes
[00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:05.760]   talk to me when that's supposed to be talking to me uh... their situation what the word
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:10.200]   international waters it's okay to say this stuff no it's not
[00:51:10.200 --> 00:51:13.120]   and it's not this has absolutely nothing to do with any topic we're currently talking
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:17.680]   about the product dating back some in some cases back from like eight or nine years ago
[00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:20.840]   before ninety seven maybe there are a lot there are a lot of things that could stop
[00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:24.600]   uh... right me there's a clear for instance and some of us so stupid that when people
[00:51:24.600 --> 00:51:28.480]   are expecting this special inside dope off well of course as we know the new i can store
[00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:33.000]   in in pollnesia has an open yet there's a special international no it's because they
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:36.180]   they wanted to have their goal was to have x x hundred thousand units rate of ship they
[00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:39.560]   had less than that and so they didn't want to blow the biggest blast of p_r_ they're
[00:51:39.560 --> 00:51:42.880]   going to get so they decided let's do it in january we're already going to get more
[00:51:42.880 --> 00:51:46.480]   p_r_ from whatever keynote appearance that c_v_ job is going to be doing
[00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:49.520]   uh... it could be projections about how big the
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:54.040]   needs slash demand would be for the holidays are we agreed though that there will be a
[00:51:54.040 --> 00:51:56.480]   touch screen i thought we are not
[00:51:56.480 --> 00:52:00.920]   but why not because i mean it until you until
[00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:02.520]   steve or whoever
[00:52:02.520 --> 00:52:07.680]   actually gets up on the stage and with his mouth expresses to the world
[00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:11.520]   that something is really just not real it's just not but he did that with i_t_v_
[00:52:11.520 --> 00:52:12.480]   already
[00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:14.480]   well he did that right
[00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:18.480]   and that was very cleverly done to preempt other people's announcements and so
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:21.480]   forth and it also it also sort of changes the dialogue about and it didn't
[00:52:21.480 --> 00:52:24.360]   cannibalize any existing apple product more to the point is that but even
[00:52:24.360 --> 00:52:27.280]   better than that it's sort of makes it makes the upcoming i-pod debates
[00:52:27.280 --> 00:52:28.360]   interesting because
[00:52:28.360 --> 00:52:31.720]   when the movie store in the t_v_ store came out of the video store came out
[00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:34.440]   you're thinking okay well obviously now this this implies is going to be a big
[00:52:34.440 --> 00:52:37.800]   screen ipod now there's well waited made wait a minute maybe there's not going
[00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:39.400]   to be one because now
[00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:42.320]   they're preparing another device that's more that is more appropriate
[00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:45.400]   for watching big screen video so maybe they're going to simply say no the
[00:52:45.400 --> 00:52:48.920]   items of still uh... the i_b_ the center screen ipod is we want the same size
[00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:52.040]   one that big mechanical excuse me mechanical looking scroll wheel
[00:52:52.040 --> 00:52:53.920]   so they see a good thing in person display
[00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:57.800]   we're just gonna have this i_t_v_ device as the intended best that i don't like
[00:52:57.800 --> 00:53:02.400]   the idea of a touchscreen to be honest with i i i like the idea however of
[00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:06.360]   of rumor killing disinformation leakages in three words or less there's
[00:53:06.360 --> 00:53:12.280]   something that i think that that's a little bit less at puerl whenever
[00:53:12.280 --> 00:53:14.280]   it's a real life
[00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:15.280]   the
[00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:17.800]   the student is a sharing device the i_pods also sharing device there's
[00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:20.360]   sharing things that maybe you don't want to get there
[00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:21.400]   you know like like carpet
[00:53:21.400 --> 00:53:25.000]   i mean but seriously this is a content the ipod sports bureau
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:26.600]   it's
[00:53:26.600 --> 00:53:29.720]   there's two different things that could happen one
[00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:30.760]   it i mean
[00:53:30.760 --> 00:53:34.480]   i i've definitely known of products whose
[00:53:34.480 --> 00:53:38.240]   announcements have been shredded ten minutes before the keynote for whatever
[00:53:38.240 --> 00:53:39.960]   reason there's a thing that i
[00:53:39.960 --> 00:53:43.000]   i can't talk about for all different reasons that we're like it would be
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:46.120]   right you could but it would be wrong exactly but when you're just shocked
[00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:47.640]   you you understand house
[00:53:47.640 --> 00:53:50.680]   house i understand how stupid i am about how it goes into marketing where we
[00:53:50.680 --> 00:53:51.800]   like it but
[00:53:51.800 --> 00:53:54.880]   it's so real it's so good that both now we decided that
[00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:56.320]   and like
[00:53:56.320 --> 00:54:00.040]   and it's got for every three things i think i understand about apple and other
[00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:02.360]   companies i know there are always a hundred other things that i can only
[00:54:02.360 --> 00:54:03.240]   guess that so
[00:54:03.240 --> 00:54:05.960]   you there's no room for arrogance there's no reason to believe a rumor
[00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:07.840]   just by the evening when a good news
[00:54:07.840 --> 00:54:10.160]   uh... three apple and no
[00:54:10.160 --> 00:54:13.440]   there are three apple plays avoid this ship and i think it was you name a point
[00:54:13.440 --> 00:54:16.160]   out that they could appear on the show but it would be our last day
[00:54:16.160 --> 00:54:20.240]   at apple and all apple employees are allowed to speak on their last day
[00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:24.400]   but the i mean the speaking of which the other the other potential
[00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:28.800]   outcome for this is you know we have precedent of products being killed for
[00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:29.520]   rumors
[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:30.880]   not that i would
[00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:33.360]   promote this as a candidate for such
[00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:36.560]   but you know we've lost that way you don't go all the way down the line of
[00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:39.360]   product cycle and then kill it because somebody leaked it
[00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:43.120]   uh... it's been done it's it's happened especially really yeah can you give us an
[00:54:43.120 --> 00:54:44.480]   example there was a
[00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:48.080]   firewire thing at one point you know that's a lot of money to throw away just
[00:54:48.080 --> 00:54:51.440]   because of the rumor of firewire interference one of the eight
[00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:52.720]   firewire
[00:54:52.720 --> 00:54:54.960]   sipsipsipsipsips
[00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:56.800]   if you like that
[00:54:56.800 --> 00:54:58.160]   sipsips
[00:54:58.160 --> 00:55:01.040]   uh... yeah i got a point at your work with an air-stuck your work
[00:55:01.040 --> 00:55:04.400]   head-suckin like in whispering is a fact not going to do any good at all
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:07.440]   this is true now that we have those really petite little madonna mics that
[00:55:07.440 --> 00:55:10.320]   that madonna puts on what she dances you want to pay attention to how old she's
[00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:11.040]   gotten
[00:55:11.040 --> 00:55:13.520]   uh... their flesh color all right
[00:55:13.520 --> 00:55:14.720]   for my age
[00:55:14.720 --> 00:55:18.480]   anyone who's been bolted to a crystal cross you know this is not this week in
[00:55:18.480 --> 00:55:19.760]   madonna much as it
[00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:23.440]   that could be the next but in all seriousness i mean i think that there's
[00:55:23.440 --> 00:55:27.520]   been precedents of of both things being canceled for that
[00:55:27.520 --> 00:55:31.440]   you think for that reason i'll accept that i'll accept that and just because
[00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:34.880]   you know it just shows apples absolute commitment to secrecy
[00:55:34.880 --> 00:55:39.360]   no it's their right and as a company it's absolutely very right whether it's
[00:55:39.360 --> 00:55:42.080]   intelligent is another matter just getting just getting back to the
[00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:45.760]   to the baseline response though we all know quote unquote that there's a
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:48.640]   touchscreen ipod out because we've all seen like patent filings have been
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:52.000]   posted everywhere i know one came out last week exactly and we all know that
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.880]   there's a there's an iphone coming out because we've all heard the story is
[00:55:54.880 --> 00:55:57.680]   about how steve not even being terribly cajun with his friends about it
[00:55:57.680 --> 00:56:00.400]   but even so and we've also had reports from it ain't
[00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:04.320]   it ain't real to the the skinny guy and i don't i don't i know better i know
[00:56:04.320 --> 00:56:07.280]   better than to know that it's a fact until i'm actually holding one in my
[00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:11.440]   hand or at least exactly right i'm store apple com it's not
[00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:14.960]   really the the problem that i have with rumor sites is when people start
[00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:19.120]   treating rumor this is no rumor this is a document that apple rumor
[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:21.760]   but you opened the can didn't all right
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:24.240]   that's quite i just want to quickly defend the so-called rumor sites there's a
[00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:26.000]   lot of them doing really good journalism
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.800]   there are a lot of sites that they they will not simply say hey we
[00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:33.200]   this dude sent us an email with a picture of what is totally an ipod pda
[00:56:33.200 --> 00:56:36.880]   and it's also video and it wouldn't be they couldn't fake a video could they
[00:56:36.880 --> 00:56:39.840]   yes yes i'm some design student who wanted to show how good he could
[00:56:39.840 --> 00:56:42.400]   design stuff could have faked that thing whereas there are others who say well
[00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:44.640]   look we got this information from this source and
[00:56:44.640 --> 00:56:47.920]   he's we've heard from the source six times and six times he's given us reliable
[00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:52.080]   information who's the best uh i really like apple insider
[00:56:52.080 --> 00:56:57.440]   uh i'm again no uh nothing uh the previous statement is still true that
[00:56:57.440 --> 00:57:00.800]   don't believe in to actually see it but if i thought that something was not
[00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:03.600]   possible or apple would never get into this business if i see it on apple
[00:57:03.600 --> 00:57:06.720]   insider i at least have to start calling people and say okay what is there
[00:57:06.720 --> 00:57:09.200]   something that i don't know is there something i have really thought about
[00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:13.760]   you know seems like that does damage to the stock price too though
[00:57:13.760 --> 00:57:17.360]   oh hell everything does damage i mean i mean that's i wish i were an apple
[00:57:17.360 --> 00:57:20.000]   stockholder right now i don't i think that nothing's going to hurt that
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.880]   stock price for some time but that they see they used to be worse back when the
[00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:26.160]   wild wild west days before apple really clamped down on rumors and made it
[00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:29.040]   made at the third rail of apple employed and
[00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:33.120]   the manual uh it's not anymore oh no you i think it still is
[00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:36.320]   it's still right but he's even before that there was there was a time when it was
[00:57:36.320 --> 00:57:39.280]   really the wild wild west and i would back when mac week was mac leak
[00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:43.520]   exactly i would get routinely things in my inbox where someone would so tell me
[00:57:43.520 --> 00:57:47.200]   about this new uh print this new print architecture or this new
[00:57:47.200 --> 00:57:49.600]   printer this new piece of hardware that was coming out that well it's it's
[00:57:49.600 --> 00:57:52.000]   really really good but it would be like from this
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:55.920]   dock door cyber dude lead to that you know whatever.com
[00:57:55.920 --> 00:57:59.120]   like this basic 40 year old person trying to make you think he's a 16 year old
[00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:02.400]   person email address and he said oh yeah it's good but the
[00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:05.520]   room the rumor is uh because i saw it it didn't really work and we don't really
[00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:08.880]   know how we can put it in the network and i'm like okay chances are i think at
[00:58:08.880 --> 00:58:12.560]   least two out of five this is an apple product manager and this is a
[00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:15.600]   competing product he wants to make sure that buzz starts getting negative
[00:58:15.600 --> 00:58:18.480]   so he can say he can basically go back into a meeting later on say well you
[00:58:18.480 --> 00:58:21.040]   know already the buzz is bad already we're projecting this is going to be
[00:58:21.040 --> 00:58:24.240]   failure why don't you give us the budget the manpower and the resources to make
[00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:24.720]   this work.
[00:58:24.720 --> 00:58:27.360]   god they clamp down on that it is not like a whatever on the company.
[00:58:27.360 --> 00:58:30.160]   One of the dangers though is when it leaps into mainstream media when it gets
[00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:31.840]   quoted in mainstream media.
[00:58:31.840 --> 00:58:33.520]   Good news is the same mainstream media.
[00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:35.840]   How much am I this?
[00:58:35.840 --> 00:58:36.960]   I get sure with that.
[00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:40.640]   Google just, I suppose the guy from the Wall Street
[00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:42.480]   here play for all of our publications and stuff.
[00:58:42.480 --> 00:58:43.280]   Damn.
[00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:48.000]   Uh google just bought jot spot which is uh a joke i think this is Joe Kraus the
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:53.440]   guy who did excite went off uh sold excite found a jot spot which is a wiki
[00:58:53.440 --> 00:58:57.120]   kind of actually pretty good wiki server company.
[00:58:57.120 --> 00:59:00.240]   2000 customers they say paid between five and two hundred dollars a month for
[00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:03.760]   wikis another acquisition for google their first wiki i think.
[00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:04.400]   Is this service?
[00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:06.800]   Yeah i think so but it also had like a spread sheet component which is somewhere
[00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:08.480]   to their sheets google.
[00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:11.280]   They do they have one of the nice things about jot spot is they have they look
[00:59:11.280 --> 00:59:14.160]   like active ex controls i don't know how they really implement them but uh but
[00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:17.520]   they're embedded little controls for a variety of different commonly done
[00:59:17.520 --> 00:59:20.400]   things including spreadsheets and churning and that would be a good
[00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:21.600]   acquisition for google.
[00:59:21.600 --> 00:59:25.280]   Yeah it might be good to really expand because they took rightly over what
[00:59:25.280 --> 00:59:25.920]   a few months ago.
[00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:28.960]   Yeah now so they've got spreadsheets they've got rightly they've got calendar
[00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:33.920]   they've got email they've got wiki uh what more does google need?
[00:59:33.920 --> 00:59:34.880]   The love of a good woman.
[00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:37.520]   That's you.
[00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:43.920]   Thank god thank god this is mainstream media right so kick your ass right now.
[00:59:46.320 --> 00:59:49.600]   Somebody said a browser they don't really need a browser do they what they want to
[00:59:49.600 --> 00:59:51.520]   get they get firefox they don't need a browser.
[00:59:51.520 --> 00:59:53.680]   One thing that google needs they don't have yet is they they don't have the
[00:59:53.680 --> 00:59:59.920]   apis that yahoo has for doing remote access like yahoo provides uh jason callback so
[00:59:59.920 --> 01:00:02.400]   you can actually do everything client side where google doesn't have anything like
[01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:02.560]   that.
[01:00:02.560 --> 01:00:04.960]   So the google api is not as rich as the yahoo api.
[01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:08.080]   Yahoo api is actually much better for small sites to use directly.
[01:00:08.080 --> 01:00:10.960]   Yeah that's interesting yeah so eventually i think google catch up when they figure
[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:14.320]   out what they're doing wrong but yeah that's that's the kind of thing that i mean
[01:00:14.320 --> 01:00:17.760]   well google knows what value there is in that when you look at google maps and all the map
[01:00:17.760 --> 01:00:21.440]   mashups clearly a good api is a great way to outvalue.
[01:00:21.440 --> 01:00:25.120]   Also the yahoo api at least for like the maps i know a friend of mine that's doing real estate
[01:00:25.120 --> 01:00:30.320]   with it and apparently the yahoo api is more open for commercial reuse than google's api
[01:00:30.320 --> 01:00:31.280]   for that kind of stuff.
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:36.080]   Well if i'm yahoo i'm looking at what google's doing i'm thinking how do i get a jump on them
[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:38.560]   well that's one of the ways to do it be having more liberal license.
[01:00:38.560 --> 01:00:41.600]   I'm sure some of this is catch up because you know yahoo's you know playing the number two
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:46.160]   role here but uh yahoo is actually also gone ahead and opened up a bunch of
[01:00:46.160 --> 01:00:50.000]   javascript client side stuff that is really really nice so they're providing
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.840]   essentially tools that rival prototype gs and js and a few of the other things are being used
[01:00:53.840 --> 01:00:58.240]   for ruby on rails they're using the same sort of things but they're i got a much larger user
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:01:03.920]   community and uh yahoo's using it inside as well so you don't have to use php to interface.
[01:01:03.920 --> 01:01:07.200]   It's not gonna use bhqp so they all have all this stuff that downloads creates
[01:01:07.200 --> 01:01:11.040]   javascript it's all compressed javascript so it downloads nicely it's under a bsd style
[01:01:11.040 --> 01:01:14.720]   license so very easy to reuse for commercial applications they're releasing a couple new
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:18.320]   packages a month they're very active in their own mailing list they're public mailing list
[01:01:18.320 --> 01:01:25.760]   so they're really trying to become sort of the big open source supporter of really good
[01:01:25.760 --> 01:01:30.960]   cross-platform tool kits to be used in things that they're building their front page with or
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:36.160]   yahoo mail with and things like that and google's nowhere near that the google client side stuff
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:40.480]   is some really weird thing that you start out writing code in java and it compiles to java's
[01:01:40.480 --> 01:01:43.360]   now a little disclaimer here you've done some consulting work for yahoo on this
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:47.920]   so i'm a little bit i've seen both sides though all right okay google's also released it we haven't
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:51.360]   seen it yet because we've been shipboard and it's costing us as you said eight dollars a
[01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:55.360]   minute to download anything but they have a new gmail mobile client a java client for phones
[01:01:55.360 --> 01:02:02.400]   uh gmail.com/app will run on any phone that supports uh the uh mobile java
[01:02:02.400 --> 01:02:07.680]   implementation and uh i talked to amma carter who's a big gmail fan uh and she says she loves it
[01:02:07.680 --> 01:02:11.280]   it's really working great i think that's a nice feature but does does still have this still use
[01:02:11.280 --> 01:02:16.320]   the old style uh phone interface for software where it will automatically attach numbers next to
[01:02:16.320 --> 01:02:20.320]   different menu options because that's my biggest that's nice though isn't it no it's terrible because
[01:02:20.320 --> 01:02:23.680]   you don't like that well because i'm window smartphone which is my favorite mobile operating
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:27.920]   system it uses the keep and in the browser app it uses the keypad for scrolling so every time i
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:32.000]   i'm just gonna naturally hit the nine button to scroll down and out oh you just said thank you
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:36.000]   for deleting all your email thank you right right right it's it's actually sort of reduced that's a
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:40.240]   good question i do not know i haven't yeah i mean i was kind of upset when blog lines updated their
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:46.160]   mobile uh mobile side and blog lines mobile is it transforms any phone you start accessing
[01:02:46.160 --> 01:02:50.640]   you know it does such a wonderful job of taking a complicated browser based interface and totally
[01:02:50.640 --> 01:02:54.800]   redoing it for for mobile it's just wonderful but now they added it they they bad it basically
[01:02:54.800 --> 01:03:00.080]   did a deal with squeezer so that if you follow a link from one of your rss items you know it's not
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:03.360]   the whole of articles just gives you a link to something it will instead of taking you to the
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:07.840]   real web page now we'll take you to it will go through squeezer to turn it to a more mobile
[01:03:07.840 --> 01:03:11.680]   appropriate looking page which is a kind of a nice thing but again squeezer also uses numeric
[01:03:11.680 --> 01:03:14.240]   numeric menus at the very end so now i can't i have to
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:17.440]   down down down down down down down down down down down down down down instead of just
[01:03:17.440 --> 01:03:22.960]   that's you know i just looking at this and again i can't because i haven't installed it uh it looks
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:28.560]   like uh it's very clean they've got a menu option so i i think you probably will be able to scroll
[01:03:28.560 --> 01:03:32.480]   until you hit that menu option and then you'll have to possibly then you will numbers will be
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:36.640]   activated photos are instantly resized to fit the screen size of your mobile device
[01:03:36.640 --> 01:03:41.680]   um in some ways amber thought this it's a blackberry killer it turns any phone
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:48.640]   with at the supports j2 me into into a pretty good email device non verizon phone yeah as long as
[01:03:48.640 --> 01:03:53.520]   you're not using verizon you're okay uh verizon doesn't support yes they do on the razor don't they
[01:03:53.520 --> 01:03:59.280]   rise and well verizon uses brew and so you can't do any of the j2 me stuff it's all locked down only
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:03.840]   verizon apps can go on verizon phones yeah that's that's why i will never buy a verizon phone
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:07.440]   matter of fact they've stopped they've been smart enough to stop sending me phones to write about
[01:04:07.440 --> 01:04:10.960]   because i've been saying that oh no after the second or third i simply had to say well look if
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:14.800]   this is a nice phone but if you if you want to send it to me realize that the first three paragraphs
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:19.200]   are going to be motoral if the motoral feature the set for this phone is wonderful but it's too bad
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:23.520]   that verizon is turned off be able to email photos turned off this feature that every feature that
[01:04:23.520 --> 01:04:28.240]   competes with the pace well they turn off bluetooth exactly yeah thus rendering it this ringtone
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:33.440]   yeah it's just this rendering into a useless you know it's like being back in 1988 you know
[01:04:33.440 --> 01:04:36.880]   it may as well have a brick phone for all the features that you that you get for free with
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:42.560]   the thing it's it's a useless service google's started to share revenue on its google video
[01:04:42.560 --> 01:04:50.160]   started with the mentos guys they do it did a new mentos uh fountain video uh i guess the
[01:04:50.160 --> 01:04:55.120]   story was they made something like 30 grand off of river uh with the video on river river of course
[01:04:55.120 --> 01:05:00.640]   shares its revenue uh and google clearly seeing this is a this is a gap in google videos now said
[01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:05.840]   we're gonna uh invite now it's not clear whether anybody can do this or you have to somehow get it
[01:05:05.840 --> 01:05:11.200]   make a deal with google uh to share video but um 50 percent of ad revenue it says we'll go to
[01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:17.680]   videographers only girl 15 is moving there every time i see something like that i always have to
[01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:21.840]   realize how little i know about real legal aspects and how often i wind up having to call
[01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:25.360]   people to ask because this asks this makes me wonder what the legal aspects are going to be
[01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:28.800]   now what are you giving up now well not not only what you're giving up but now that we have content
[01:05:28.800 --> 01:05:33.280]   that's monetized and content that's not monetized is that give if i have content that's being either
[01:05:33.280 --> 01:05:37.280]   pirated or maybe being ex-servited does that give me a bigger club with which to hit this other person
[01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:41.680]   saying well look it's no longer i know i know i know we're both make in the old in the old mechanism
[01:05:41.680 --> 01:05:46.080]   we're both making no money off of this video we post it off onto onto google video if my video is
[01:05:46.080 --> 01:05:50.000]   now generating revenue can i now say hey look you're denying me revenue now i can actually get an
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:54.640]   attorney who's willing to take on my case it sounds right you know wow the google hasn't indicated
[01:05:54.640 --> 01:05:57.920]   whether this will extend a youtube which of course they bought just a few weeks ago but i
[01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:02.720]   presume it would right now it can't because they haven't finished the deal is a 50 percent net or
[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:10.080]   gross uh boy you sound like you're talking uh 50 percent of ad revenue but the problem with
[01:06:10.080 --> 01:06:14.880]   google is they've never revealed what their actual ad revenue is you just kind of assume if you use
[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:18.320]   google ad sense that you're getting your fair share but you don't really know how much they're
[01:06:18.320 --> 01:06:26.000]   making we need independent audits no wait sounds expensive 70 million dollars later
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:30.320]   if these video services were any good at auditing the only videos on there would be more like
[01:06:30.320 --> 01:06:35.040]   cat with a sombrero chasing a bug videos that would no the reason for going to google video and
[01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:38.800]   going to youtube would not exist because no you no longer get tv shows you can no longer get me
[01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:42.560]   videos right well in fact my space is announced now that they're going to use this fingerprinting
[01:06:42.560 --> 01:06:47.920]   technology for the sound for the uh for the sound for the audio on my space this has been a big
[01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:52.240]   problem of course on youtube another effect this was part of the youtube deal was there be some sort
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:56.640]   of fingerprinting so that cop rights holders could find their stuff on youtube and and ask
[01:06:56.640 --> 01:07:02.160]   that people down uh my space which of course is owned by news corp r/berdox company is going to use
[01:07:02.160 --> 01:07:08.400]   audio fingerprinting technology to block users from uploading copyrighted music to my space so
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:12.080]   this i think you're gonna see this every this is gonna be universal and you're right y'all you're
[01:07:12.080 --> 01:07:16.800]   gonna see is cat videos yeah i mean especially i i'm always disappointed when i see where
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:21.440]   companies priorities are my space by god it's such a terrible terrible way to have a presence
[01:07:21.440 --> 01:07:25.600]   on the net okay you're the you're the fault fonts are terrible that fault is a terrible i told my
[01:07:25.600 --> 01:07:30.880]   my my my my my 14 year old daughter is of course big into my space as all her friends are i said
[01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:34.720]   honey don't you understand this is so web 1.0 this is the worst user and if you see what's wrong
[01:07:34.720 --> 01:07:38.080]   with the user interface you click here you know but you don't understand it's ugly no i see it
[01:07:38.080 --> 01:07:40.960]   works just fine but you don't understand there's all these ads what are you talking about but
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:44.800]   even it's their culture well but they don't know any better well they do they used to know better
[01:07:44.800 --> 01:07:48.720]   they used to be using vlogs off for that actually has here eight really nicely professionals like
[01:07:48.720 --> 01:07:52.560]   we're also not going to make it easier for to have whatever crappy garage brand you stumbled
[01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:57.280]   on to an hour ago blare through my speakers at three eight fourteen year old cares but
[01:07:57.280 --> 01:08:01.840]   but this is another marketing principle that she cares is the old guy their flair and trousers
[01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:09.680]   and their long hair their bebop music but he's he's a he's a stalwart i'm very good it's another
[01:08:09.680 --> 01:08:14.800]   marketing principle that the the enemy of the exceptional or the enemy of the very good is
[01:08:14.800 --> 01:08:22.080]   the good enough i mean the mediocre you know and it's worked yes just ask bill on the top page
[01:08:22.080 --> 01:08:27.600]   my website is slogan by i think Voltaire said saying the better is always the enemy of good
[01:08:27.600 --> 01:08:34.400]   but i wish that my space were even good it's just there it's just there speaking of bill uh windows
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:40.240]   amazingly microsoft is capitulated on the license agreement to windows vista the license initially
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:46.080]   said you could only transfer it once to another device they've now uh... remove according to uh...
[01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:50.800]   this is from arse technica they've removed the language relating to device transfers and it now
[01:08:50.800 --> 01:08:55.520]   says quote you may install one copy of the software on the license device may you may use the software
[01:08:55.520 --> 01:09:01.680]   on up to two processors on that device at one time what if you have a quad what if you have a quad
[01:09:01.680 --> 01:09:05.040]   i don't know what you do you have to buy another another license of windows for the other two
[01:09:05.040 --> 01:09:10.720]   processors the other two just crash you may use software and two processors at one time except
[01:09:10.720 --> 01:09:14.640]   is provided in the storage and network use ultimate edition sections below you may not use
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:21.200]   hahaha written by brian michael benham the ultimate windows let me say i use the software and the
[01:09:21.200 --> 01:09:25.360]   other device i don't know what that means three years old and is a half mutant uh...
[01:09:25.360 --> 01:09:30.320]   just a penultimate was just before that hello hello to the official getting these references by the way
[01:09:30.320 --> 01:09:34.320]   i want to thank you guys for being here i want to thank our audience to for joining us on ship
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:37.280]   boarder you could have been playing snowball jackpot bingo but no
[01:09:37.280 --> 01:09:43.120]   you came here to to keep it working with the packing voting machine for that oh yeah do you
[01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:49.520]   want to mention that briefly yeah it it it is kind of an interesting week in in that way you know
[01:09:49.520 --> 01:09:52.320]   if you're coming up on a big election in just a couple of days we're going to get off the boat
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:57.520]   and have to vote a lot of companies counties and states and municipalities are still using
[01:09:57.520 --> 01:10:01.440]   these debold and other electronic voting machines that are very suspect in fact there was a story in
[01:10:01.440 --> 01:10:05.840]   texas about a voting machine that as if you've if you happen to vote the democratic slate you
[01:10:05.840 --> 01:10:10.000]   had to vote the perfect democratic slate would change it to the republican slate
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:13.440]   coincidence yeah i think not
[01:10:13.440 --> 01:10:19.680]   you pass out in florida you pass out the fully firmware update i think so yeah
[01:10:19.680 --> 01:10:26.320]   either there's a there's a really dry academic but um exceptional video on on on this whole
[01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:32.240]   issue showing just showing you precisely how easy it is to hack one of these things
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:39.200]   over it i think it's it policy dot princeton dot eu slash voting and it's painful to watch i mean
[01:10:39.200 --> 01:10:44.960]   it's it's got no production value at all but we did we did on the screen savers for three or four
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:49.440]   years ago we had the guys come on well and show us how easy was to hack and it hasn't
[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:54.400]   been proposed i could tell been fixed right and and the professors did this it wasn't you know the
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:11:00.720]   kids doing it but it's it's a pretty interesting um uh issue and i don't really know how we're
[01:11:00.720 --> 01:11:06.400]   going to solve it but the well everybody agree everybody i know agrees the only solution is uh
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:10.800]   is some sort of paper receipt it's got a point i don't even trust the paper receipts at least you
[01:11:10.800 --> 01:11:14.640]   can do a recount of some custom this there's going to be something that counts the paper receipts
[01:11:14.640 --> 01:11:18.640]   but it's going to come from the same company i don't know really the only the only solution is
[01:11:18.640 --> 01:11:22.480]   going to be requirement we will not validate this machine unless the operating system all the
[01:11:22.480 --> 01:11:26.880]   software is open source unless everybody just post on the post on the web it was this one that
[01:11:26.880 --> 01:11:30.720]   works for for encryption because you would think that making the encryption public would make it
[01:11:30.720 --> 01:11:33.840]   weaker but no one actually every time you have a christian system gets broken it's a good point
[01:11:33.840 --> 01:11:39.280]   except except except remember the dentists richie gcc hack though they hacked a compiler
[01:11:39.280 --> 01:11:43.680]   yeah i took a compiler so that it would recognize when it was being compiled for itself what it was
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:48.480]   running so you so the code looked ostensibly completely clean you have to also examine the
[01:11:48.480 --> 01:11:51.840]   compiler code to make sure it's clean it would recognize it would recognize itself and insert
[01:11:51.840 --> 01:11:56.960]   a hack that when it was compiling login dot c it would put a backdoor in the login not see so
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:00.160]   anybody login using an own password did he do that as a demonstration or is because did dentists
[01:12:00.160 --> 01:12:03.600]   just want to be able to get in uh no he just demonstrated he on eunuchs he didn't matter but
[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:07.360]   yeah he did as a demonstration that just having the source code is not enough because if you can
[01:12:07.360 --> 01:12:12.000]   if you control the compiler chain you still get your way in so what does eff say about this
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:17.360]   i mean it's you know it's costing me a bucks a minute just to sit here i for more information go to
[01:12:17.360 --> 01:12:24.240]   eff.org you know they're probably fighting some good fire but other could use a donation or two
[01:12:24.240 --> 01:12:28.160]   from and there's a good website i can't remember it on electronic voting uh that's very good
[01:12:28.160 --> 01:12:32.320]   includes links to that uh demo that you talked about and it's escape and no one knows what this
[01:12:32.320 --> 01:12:36.640]   table is worried about kids hacking these systems no any kids it's republicans i mean
[01:12:36.800 --> 01:12:40.240]   what did i say what did i just say well i'm just worried about general denial of service because if
[01:12:40.240 --> 01:12:44.720]   you can get a good virus into this this little smart card thing get it inserted in the system then
[01:12:44.720 --> 01:12:48.560]   you could you could cause chaos there would be this this country would be in an uproar if an
[01:12:48.560 --> 01:12:53.520]   election result was we don't have to have the paper ballots are any better let's face it but
[01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:58.560]   but i'd much rather do paper ballots than i would too actually well it's it's not that it's a better
[01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:02.400]   technology just as a more mature technology if you're not enough you're sure as you in the least
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:09.280]   i've heard that seven thousand lawyers on tuesday will be dispatched to watch our elections this is if
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:14.960]   you know i could just i'm just waiting for iran to send independent observers to watch our elections
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:20.560]   who is fennas wayla's sending people to our elections most most of our vacation is better
[01:13:20.560 --> 01:13:26.160]   than a broadway show seven thousand lawyers are going to be watching for three hundred million

[01:16:19.680 --> 01:16:29.600]   so
[01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:37.840]   wait a minute it's bingo time let's listen in
[01:16:37.840 --> 01:16:43.600]   and uh if there is no late denominator raise your captain speaking
[01:16:43.600 --> 01:16:49.840]   better voice from the bridge voice from the bridge electrical information altitude zero position
[01:16:49.840 --> 01:16:58.000]   today 24 degrees is 0.37 minutes north and 84 degrees 4.25 minutes west
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:04.320]   bingo and it puts us out another five miles west of the drive to dogas this is the most
[01:17:04.320 --> 01:17:10.880]   western group of islands in the floradaki chain of islands so about another five miles to the
[01:17:10.880 --> 01:17:15.680]   west and that's right in the middle they're only to go straight now we fold this
[01:17:15.680 --> 01:17:20.560]   20 degrees and we're making a present speed of eight it's the first twit that's actually been
[01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:26.800]   positioned exactly by the minute but as you can see outside here conceval my gaps and the wind is
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:30.320]   slowing us down the light gap
[01:17:30.320 --> 01:17:37.440]   if traveled at this of 355 not the last now it's made how many miles does that depend on the miles?
[01:17:37.440 --> 01:18:04.480]   [Music]
[01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:08.560]   let's all go do the thing at the end
[01:18:08.560 --> 01:18:13.120]   the air temperature 26 degrees Celsius or 79 degrees Fahrenheit
[01:18:13.120 --> 01:18:18.320]   and the sea water temperature still 30 degrees Celsius for 80-60 degrees Fahrenheit
[01:18:18.320 --> 01:18:22.400]   now we're sailing into the ferret channel the ferret channel
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:28.400]   [Music]
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:33.280]   all rates of tempo range is long and winding routes and sometimes they can go fast there
[01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:38.480]   sometimes it goes slow there and there's not a good speed boost around to four problems
[01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:41.920]   this is amazing
[01:18:41.920 --> 01:18:50.160]   [Music]
[01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:52.960]   round the morning
[01:18:52.960 --> 01:19:03.840]   [Music]
[01:19:03.840 --> 01:19:08.640]   all right I should have paid attention I don't know what I'm gonna do too much work
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:13.360]   the problem is there's no limit my servers completely collapsed so here's the deal
[01:19:13.360 --> 01:19:18.080]   I'm just trying to get the thing off but I have a hell of a time when blue screens like forget it
[01:19:18.080 --> 01:19:21.520]   I'm killing you
