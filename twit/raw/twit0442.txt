[00:02:01.140 --> 00:02:04.740]   This week in tech to show the covers of weeks tech news.
[00:02:04.740 --> 00:02:06.420]   And as always we have a fun panel.
[00:02:06.420 --> 00:02:09.020]   We bring in, you know, we bust them in.
[00:02:09.020 --> 00:02:11.180]   It's kind of like a casino.
[00:02:11.180 --> 00:02:12.660]   We go down, we go over to the East Bay.
[00:02:12.660 --> 00:02:14.380]   We say anybody want to do Twit.
[00:02:14.380 --> 00:02:16.460]   John C. de Vorak shows up in a straight shirt.
[00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:19.020]   Yeah, but you're using the great and casino bus.
[00:02:19.020 --> 00:02:21.140]   The casino bus.
[00:02:21.140 --> 00:02:22.460]   We give them a free lunch.
[00:02:22.460 --> 00:02:23.460]   Yeah, here I am.
[00:02:23.460 --> 00:02:25.020]   He enjoys it.
[00:02:25.020 --> 00:02:29.060]   Also here, we couldn't get him to come over to the casino, but Tim Stevens is joining
[00:02:29.060 --> 00:02:30.060]   us.
[00:02:30.060 --> 00:02:31.060]   Look, I'm--
[00:02:31.060 --> 00:02:32.060]   I'm--
[00:02:32.060 --> 00:02:33.060]   Squares the buffet.
[00:02:33.060 --> 00:02:34.060]   I can't.
[00:02:34.060 --> 00:02:35.060]   It's fine.
[00:02:35.060 --> 00:02:36.060]   From CNET.
[00:02:36.060 --> 00:02:37.060]   From CNET.
[00:02:37.060 --> 00:02:40.820]   And I love-- I think every tech journalist has this, the badge display over your left
[00:02:40.820 --> 00:02:41.820]   shoulder there.
[00:02:41.820 --> 00:02:42.820]   All the--
[00:02:42.820 --> 00:02:43.820]   Yes.
[00:02:43.820 --> 00:02:44.820]   --trait show badges.
[00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:45.820]   It's getting all unruly at the moment.
[00:02:45.820 --> 00:02:47.540]   I think I'm going to organize that on these days.
[00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:48.540]   I don't know.
[00:02:48.540 --> 00:02:51.540]   I think that's the point is to be a little disorganized, kind of like--
[00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:52.540]   Do you have that?
[00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:54.460]   Do you have a tree of badges?
[00:02:54.460 --> 00:03:00.700]   You know, when I started-- years ago in the '80s, when I was a kid, I worked at Infoworld
[00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:02.260]   and Michael Swain did that.
[00:03:02.260 --> 00:03:03.260]   Yeah.
[00:03:03.260 --> 00:03:05.180]   And he had his whole office--
[00:03:05.180 --> 00:03:06.180]   Yeah.
[00:03:06.180 --> 00:03:07.180]   --to cover these badges.
[00:03:07.180 --> 00:03:08.180]   A legendary Michael Swain.
[00:03:08.180 --> 00:03:11.340]   And I felt it would be derivative for me to do that, so I never did.
[00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:12.340]   I just throw them out.
[00:03:12.340 --> 00:03:13.340]   We've all done it now.
[00:03:13.340 --> 00:03:15.620]   And thank God, because you know, I like to archive.
[00:03:15.620 --> 00:03:17.100]   It's a real problem with me.
[00:03:17.100 --> 00:03:23.820]   So here, Clayton Morris from Fox and Friends and the many podcasts, The Gluten Free.
[00:03:23.820 --> 00:03:24.820]   Clayton Morris.
[00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:25.820]   Hi, Clayton.
[00:03:25.820 --> 00:03:26.820]   Good to see you.
[00:03:26.820 --> 00:03:27.820]   Hey, how are you guys?
[00:03:27.820 --> 00:03:28.820]   Is that the--
[00:03:28.820 --> 00:03:29.820]   Yeah, I--
[00:03:29.820 --> 00:03:30.820]   Three Rivers Stadium over your right shoulder there?
[00:03:30.820 --> 00:03:31.820]   Oh, no, no.
[00:03:31.820 --> 00:03:34.380]   That's Citizens Bank Park in Philadelphia, Lee.
[00:03:34.380 --> 00:03:35.380]   Oh.
[00:03:35.380 --> 00:03:36.380]   That's all of the--
[00:03:36.380 --> 00:03:37.380]   I'm not Pittsburgh.
[00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:38.380]   It's Philadelphia.
[00:03:38.380 --> 00:03:43.820]   Two thousand eight World Series Champions.
[00:03:43.820 --> 00:03:44.820]   Not the two thousand--
[00:03:44.820 --> 00:03:47.060]   It's getting to be a dim memory, isn't it?
[00:03:47.060 --> 00:03:48.060]   Yeah.
[00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.060]   Yeah.
[00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.060]   Look at this.
[00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.740]   Comdex-- this is from Comdex in 1984.
[00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.300]   This is the first PC magazine.
[00:03:55.300 --> 00:03:57.220]   It was published in 1984.
[00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:58.220]   Wow.
[00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.220]   And this is the third Comdex.
[00:03:59.220 --> 00:04:00.220]   That's how much?
[00:04:00.220 --> 00:04:01.220]   It's an 83, or 82.
[00:04:01.220 --> 00:04:02.220]   Well, maybe it's 82.
[00:04:02.220 --> 00:04:04.660]   I just have a date.
[00:04:04.660 --> 00:04:08.580]   As usual, when you do the first edition of any magazine, you don't date it, because you
[00:04:08.580 --> 00:04:09.580]   don't know how much longer you're going to have to--
[00:04:09.580 --> 00:04:10.580]   Yeah, it'll be done.
[00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:11.580]   You might have to sell it for months.
[00:04:11.580 --> 00:04:13.580]   That might be the only--
[00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:17.020]   It came out within a year of the PC itself.
[00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:18.020]   So I think it was 82--
[00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:19.020]   Oh, okay.
[00:04:19.020 --> 00:04:20.020]   --and something like that.
[00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:21.020]   Yeah.
[00:04:21.020 --> 00:04:22.020]   That makes sense.
[00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.100]   Program Generator does graphics and music.
[00:04:24.100 --> 00:04:25.100]   Look at that.
[00:04:25.100 --> 00:04:26.100]   That's exciting.
[00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:27.900]   There's some really good stuff in that book.
[00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:28.900]   February, March 1982.
[00:04:28.900 --> 00:04:30.700]   Okay, there we go.
[00:04:30.700 --> 00:04:32.900]   So they talk about-- this is the third Comdex.
[00:04:32.900 --> 00:04:37.620]   And they talk about how it's becoming bigger and bigger, 4,500 booths and thousands of people
[00:04:37.620 --> 00:04:38.620]   at 10.
[00:04:38.620 --> 00:04:39.620]   Yeah.
[00:04:39.620 --> 00:04:40.620]   You've got bigger and bigger and bigger and then it blew up.
[00:04:40.620 --> 00:04:41.620]   It just disappeared.
[00:04:41.620 --> 00:04:42.980]   That's what happens.
[00:04:42.980 --> 00:04:49.780]   We brought out the old magazines because this was a big week for Macintosh on January 22,
[00:04:49.780 --> 00:04:50.780]   1984, 30 years ago.
[00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:52.300]   They had a big party.
[00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.460]   Yeah, they did on last night.
[00:04:54.460 --> 00:04:55.460]   I'll talk about it.
[00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:57.940]   So January 22 was a Super Bowl ad.
[00:04:57.940 --> 00:04:59.380]   The Super Bowl was early in those days.
[00:04:59.380 --> 00:05:00.380]   It was still in January.
[00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:01.380]   They keep moving.
[00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:03.380]   They'd eventually be one whole year of football.
[00:05:03.380 --> 00:05:04.380]   They're going to go to 18 games.
[00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:05.380]   I don't like it.
[00:05:05.380 --> 00:05:06.380]   I don't mind.
[00:05:06.380 --> 00:05:07.380]   Yeah.
[00:05:07.380 --> 00:05:08.380]   Players.
[00:05:08.380 --> 00:05:15.260]   On the 4th, the official announcement was at Flint Center for a shareholders meeting.
[00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:21.820]   And then recently-- and I actually credit Harry McCracken for this-- if you go to techland.time.com
[00:05:21.820 --> 00:05:27.260]   Harry McCracken's blog, you could see a video that has never been seen in public since
[00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:31.500]   1984 of Steve Jobs demonstrating the Mac for the first time in public.
[00:05:31.500 --> 00:05:33.900]   This was at the Boston Computer Society.
[00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:35.460]   Let's see.
[00:05:35.460 --> 00:05:36.460]   It was January 30.
[00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:37.460]   It was a few days later.
[00:05:37.460 --> 00:05:39.460]   The
[00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:40.460]   course there's an ad.
[00:05:40.460 --> 00:05:42.460]   It's got to be an ad.
[00:05:42.460 --> 00:05:45.820]   And great suit to be seen.
[00:05:45.820 --> 00:05:46.820]   He did look good.
[00:05:46.820 --> 00:05:49.380]   You saw it obviously Clayton.
[00:05:49.380 --> 00:05:50.980]   It was pretty cool to see this.
[00:05:50.980 --> 00:05:51.980]   Oh, yeah.
[00:05:51.980 --> 00:05:52.980]   The double-breasted suit.
[00:05:52.980 --> 00:05:54.540]   Oh, that was Tim talking.
[00:05:54.540 --> 00:05:55.540]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:05:55.540 --> 00:05:56.540]   It was Tim.
[00:05:56.540 --> 00:05:57.540]   And some chariots of fire action too.
[00:05:57.540 --> 00:05:58.540]   I'm sorry.
[00:05:58.540 --> 00:05:59.540]   Spoiler alert.
[00:05:59.540 --> 00:06:00.540]   Spoiler alert.
[00:06:00.540 --> 00:06:03.740]   Well, because we've all seen that moment where at the shareholders meeting, he takes
[00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:05.500]   the Macintosh out of the bag.
[00:06:05.500 --> 00:06:07.380]   They play the chariots of fire.
[00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:09.700]   And then the Macintosh says, hello, Macintosh.
[00:06:09.700 --> 00:06:11.580]   And that was a exciting moment.
[00:06:11.580 --> 00:06:14.180]   This is the replay of it.
[00:06:14.180 --> 00:06:18.140]   What we're going to do is simply wait until those standards emerge.
[00:06:18.140 --> 00:06:21.580]   So that's Steve talking to the Boston Computer Society.
[00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.500]   And I wrote a mouse lesson.
[00:06:23.500 --> 00:06:25.460]   Here's the Mac team all on a panel.
[00:06:25.460 --> 00:06:27.580]   Let me see if I could find the unveil.
[00:06:27.580 --> 00:06:29.700]   Yeah, here it is.
[00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:32.220]   This is some of the images from the Macintosh.
[00:06:32.220 --> 00:06:34.980]   Do you have the chariots of fire sound?
[00:06:34.980 --> 00:06:35.980]   Do we lose sound?
[00:06:35.980 --> 00:06:36.980]   Where's your Mac, by the way?
[00:06:36.980 --> 00:06:40.900]   Now we've been doing an awful lot.
[00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:42.900]   That's the 1984 ad.
[00:06:42.900 --> 00:06:50.260]   Well, but to me, really for the second time ever, we'd like to let Macintosh speak for
[00:06:50.260 --> 00:06:51.260]   itself.
[00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:55.340]   It's a home.
[00:06:55.340 --> 00:06:57.620]   Hello, I'm back in touch.
[00:06:57.620 --> 00:07:00.500]   It sure is great to get out of that bag.
[00:07:00.500 --> 00:07:06.340]   It's come a long way.
[00:07:06.340 --> 00:07:13.420]   It's the first time IBM's couldn't do this.
[00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:18.500]   The graphic display, the bit-mapped images on the screen.
[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:20.620]   All of this stuff was unique at the time.
[00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:21.620]   You know, it wasn't too long.
[00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:25.780]   Somebody in the chat was saying, you know, my amiga was 10 times better only a year later.
[00:07:25.780 --> 00:07:30.420]   But this was the first time we'd seen anything.
[00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:31.420]   It's pretty exciting.
[00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.220]   And the Boston Computer Society geeks, very excited.
[00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:35.980]   If you want to watch the whole thing, it's an hour and a half.
[00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:41.380]   One of the fun things is they kept the camera going after the event and people like WaaS
[00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:46.540]   and others were answering questions from the audience.
[00:07:46.540 --> 00:07:50.420]   That was kind of fun to see WaaS talking.
[00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:53.940]   Bill Atkinson and Andy Hertzfeld and others talking to the audience.
[00:07:53.940 --> 00:07:58.380]   These are people using Mac and Tasha's for the first time.
[00:07:58.380 --> 00:08:01.060]   Was your first computer, Clayton, for some reason, I feel like your first computer might
[00:08:01.060 --> 00:08:02.060]   have been a Mac.
[00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:05.420]   No, my first computer, I remember sitting on my dad's lap.
[00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:08.820]   We had really early IBM.
[00:08:08.820 --> 00:08:13.020]   I actually wrote a piece for Engadge a couple of years ago growing up geek.
[00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:17.420]   I talked about sitting on my dad's lap while he would write basic code.
[00:08:17.420 --> 00:08:18.420]   Wow.
[00:08:18.420 --> 00:08:22.140]   He was the first person in the neighborhood to have this old thing.
[00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:24.460]   He was writing code.
[00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:27.660]   He ran grocery stores all along the East Coast in the United States.
[00:08:27.660 --> 00:08:31.900]   He would build all these databases to manage the meat inventory for all of these different
[00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:36.460]   grocery stores up and down the East Coast.
[00:08:36.460 --> 00:08:41.580]   Just sitting there watching him do this was remarkable.
[00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:45.860]   To see then when we were robbed one time, we took our grandmother home to her apartment
[00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:47.220]   a few blocks away.
[00:08:47.220 --> 00:08:50.460]   Just in the 15 minutes we were away from the home.
[00:08:50.460 --> 00:08:55.300]   Someone broke into our house in Cherry Hill, New Jersey and smashed the windows.
[00:08:55.300 --> 00:08:59.140]   We pull up to the driveway and the lights are on upstairs and the upstairs at the house.
[00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:01.540]   My dad said, "I didn't leave the lights on."
[00:09:01.540 --> 00:09:02.540]   Oh, probably.
[00:09:02.540 --> 00:09:06.180]   You rush his in and instead of going to anywhere in the house, he didn't worry about his safety.
[00:09:06.180 --> 00:09:08.460]   He didn't look for my mom's jewelry.
[00:09:08.460 --> 00:09:11.940]   He ran right to see if the computer was still there.
[00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:15.300]   Sure enough, it was so damn heavy no one could lift the damn thing.
[00:09:15.300 --> 00:09:18.940]   Nor did they know what it was or know what they could do with it.
[00:09:18.940 --> 00:09:19.940]   Right.
[00:09:19.940 --> 00:09:22.020]   Do you understand what your first computer was?
[00:09:22.020 --> 00:09:25.260]   Yeah, it was a Commodore 64 back in the '80s.
[00:09:25.260 --> 00:09:29.660]   I did a lot of gaming on there and learned some basic programming back in the day as well.
[00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:31.780]   So did a little bit of early coding back then.
[00:09:31.780 --> 00:09:34.820]   I got a 286 after that a little later on.
[00:09:34.820 --> 00:09:37.620]   But Commodore 64 was my first computer.
[00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:43.180]   Apple.com took to the takeover Happy Birthday Mac.
[00:09:43.180 --> 00:09:48.820]   It's funny because on the 25th anniversary of the Macintosh, Apple did nothing and they
[00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:49.820]   asked Steve Jobs why not.
[00:09:49.820 --> 00:09:51.420]   He said, "I don't look backwards."
[00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:53.100]   But now that Steve has gone, Apple--
[00:09:53.100 --> 00:09:55.100]   We're starting to see him backwards a lot.
[00:09:55.100 --> 00:09:56.100]   In 1984.
[00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:58.100]   Apple does a lot of looking backwards.
[00:09:58.100 --> 00:09:59.100]   Right.
[00:09:59.100 --> 00:10:00.100]   This is a long video.
[00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:06.740]   I'm not going to show the whole thing, but showing early artists who used Macintosh to
[00:10:06.740 --> 00:10:10.020]   create Hans Zimmer's in this.
[00:10:10.020 --> 00:10:11.500]   There's a surgeon.
[00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:13.860]   It's kind of cool.
[00:10:13.860 --> 00:10:18.300]   And then after the video, if I can skip to the end, they do a little timeline on the
[00:10:18.300 --> 00:10:19.300]   web page.
[00:10:19.300 --> 00:10:21.300]   Here was my IBM 5150.
[00:10:21.300 --> 00:10:24.300]   That's what it was.
[00:10:24.300 --> 00:10:26.860]   So that was a mini computer.
[00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:27.860]   Right?
[00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:28.860]   That wasn't a PC or was it?
[00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:29.860]   It was the PC monitor.
[00:10:29.860 --> 00:10:31.860]   That was the first PC maybe.
[00:10:31.860 --> 00:10:34.300]   It was 200 pounds.
[00:10:34.300 --> 00:10:36.100]   Oh, that thing.
[00:10:36.100 --> 00:10:39.300]   Was that the box that ran basic and APL?
[00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:40.300]   Yeah.
[00:10:40.300 --> 00:10:41.300]   I actually--
[00:10:41.300 --> 00:10:42.980]   Did it have a special keyboard?
[00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:45.420]   It was a very advanced machine.
[00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:47.580]   And it did weigh a ton.
[00:10:47.580 --> 00:10:50.420]   The first IBM was a 5150.
[00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:52.460]   But that was not 200 pounds.
[00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.300]   No, there was, I think, a different number.
[00:10:54.300 --> 00:10:55.980]   I think it was 50 something.
[00:10:55.980 --> 00:10:56.980]   Yeah.
[00:10:56.980 --> 00:11:00.180]   I'm not going to ask you what your first computer, John, because you used--
[00:11:00.180 --> 00:11:01.180]   I used a rock.
[00:11:01.180 --> 00:11:02.860]   You used them in school, right?
[00:11:02.860 --> 00:11:06.380]   I had two rocks and a stick.
[00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:08.860]   You were at Berkeley in the '60s.
[00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:12.300]   I was at Berkeley when we used rocks and sticks and lines.
[00:11:12.300 --> 00:11:14.740]   Did you do computers then or did you get it?
[00:11:14.740 --> 00:11:17.100]   Actually, I was using a little Fortran action.
[00:11:17.100 --> 00:11:23.420]   I was doing-- I was one of those jokers that would put obscenities on the punch cards
[00:11:23.420 --> 00:11:25.580]   and then go register them.
[00:11:25.580 --> 00:11:28.220]   And so you go look down the line and all these people were registering this.
[00:11:28.220 --> 00:11:29.220]   What?
[00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:30.220]   Whoa, what's this?
[00:11:30.220 --> 00:11:31.220]   Some horrible obscenity.
[00:11:31.220 --> 00:11:32.220]   Some hoop.
[00:11:32.220 --> 00:11:34.620]   Well, it was our computer.
[00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:40.260]   And so we went into the lab and typed a bunch of those out and stuck them all over the place.
[00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:41.820]   So I started early.
[00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:46.540]   We have come along-- well, here's, by the way, the bite magazine, the first to the IBM PC,
[00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:48.740]   the famous cover with--
[00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:50.260]   Look at the thickness of that, though.
[00:11:50.260 --> 00:11:52.340]   This is when computer magazines were--
[00:11:52.340 --> 00:11:53.340]   That's where we are.
[00:11:53.340 --> 00:11:54.340]   And there's money to be made.
[00:11:54.340 --> 00:11:55.340]   There was money.
[00:11:55.340 --> 00:11:57.140]   Look at all the ads.
[00:11:57.140 --> 00:11:58.140]   Yeah.
[00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:00.100]   They all shot themselves in the foot.
[00:12:00.100 --> 00:12:03.500]   What cracks me up, I always thought, was a great irony of these computer magazines.
[00:12:03.500 --> 00:12:08.740]   If they had just encouraged diversity instead of getting all on board with Microsoft and
[00:12:08.740 --> 00:12:13.660]   one thing-- you know, one word processor, Microsoft's office-- by the way, Microsoft
[00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:16.900]   never advertised much, which was the irony of this whole thing.
[00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:19.900]   They essentially put all these little guys out of business and put themselves out of
[00:12:19.900 --> 00:12:20.900]   business at the same time as--
[00:12:20.900 --> 00:12:22.220]   By not buying full-page ads.
[00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:23.220]   It was hilarious.
[00:12:23.220 --> 00:12:24.220]   In the magazines.
[00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:26.700]   But, you know, I was thinking about this the other day.
[00:12:26.700 --> 00:12:30.340]   I mean, we really can credit Microsoft with the personal computer revolution of the '80s
[00:12:30.340 --> 00:12:36.940]   and '90s because they created a stable, predictable platform for developers to write software with
[00:12:36.940 --> 00:12:37.940]   that.
[00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:38.940]   Developers, developers, developers.
[00:12:38.940 --> 00:12:41.380]   Without that, I don't know if you have the PC revolution.
[00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:43.180]   There was a reason to have a mono.
[00:12:43.180 --> 00:12:47.340]   Yeah, see, this was the logic that resulted in the demise of the whole scene.
[00:12:47.340 --> 00:12:48.340]   So I've done--
[00:12:48.340 --> 00:12:53.500]   Well, maybe that's the natural consequence, but it did certainly-- I don't know.
[00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:54.500]   It feels like that.
[00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:56.420]   We wouldn't have had the kind of massive--
[00:12:56.420 --> 00:13:00.140]   I always wonder if we could do a-- if there's some way just to pull Microsoft out of the
[00:13:00.140 --> 00:13:03.940]   equation from the beginning, where would we be now?
[00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:05.300]   We could be further along.
[00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:06.300]   Really?
[00:13:06.300 --> 00:13:07.300]   Well, I mean, it's possible.
[00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:08.300]   Look at the way--
[00:13:08.300 --> 00:13:11.460]   Look at the way it happened when Apple came in and all of a sudden changed the phone and
[00:13:11.460 --> 00:13:14.860]   then the pad, which Microsoft been trying to sell all these years.
[00:13:14.860 --> 00:13:18.060]   Next thing you know, this thing is that the iPad is like a hot product.
[00:13:18.060 --> 00:13:19.060]   Everyone's jumping on board.
[00:13:19.060 --> 00:13:23.620]   Meanwhile, Microsoft had tried to promote this back in the day of Winpad and before that
[00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:29.020]   and then that more recent one, the effort never always failed.
[00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:31.020]   I think a lot of their stuff is pretty junky.
[00:13:31.020 --> 00:13:32.740]   Well, we wouldn't have it.
[00:13:32.740 --> 00:13:36.260]   I was having this discussion the other day with someone about whether or not we'd even
[00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:41.020]   have the success of Apple in the way that we do now if it wasn't for Vista and the debacle
[00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:42.020]   that was Vista.
[00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:44.900]   Oh, come on, Apple, that was a success before Vista.
[00:13:44.900 --> 00:13:45.900]   That's a good one.
[00:13:45.900 --> 00:13:47.300]   Well, I mean, think about it.
[00:13:47.300 --> 00:13:48.660]   That was a real turning point.
[00:13:48.660 --> 00:13:49.660]   I guess you're right.
[00:13:49.660 --> 00:13:50.660]   That was a real turning point.
[00:13:50.660 --> 00:13:52.660]   Think about the switching apps.
[00:13:52.660 --> 00:13:53.660]   Well, wait a minute.
[00:13:53.660 --> 00:13:54.660]   You were never millennial.
[00:13:54.660 --> 00:13:55.660]   I mean, what--
[00:13:55.660 --> 00:13:56.660]   Millennium Edition.
[00:13:56.660 --> 00:13:57.660]   Millennium Edition.
[00:13:57.660 --> 00:13:58.660]   That was pretty bad.
[00:13:58.660 --> 00:13:59.660]   Steve came back to Apple in '98.
[00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:00.660]   Did the color iMacs?
[00:14:00.660 --> 00:14:04.380]   That was when Windows '98 was the dominant and new version of Windows and I think you
[00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:06.780]   could say Apple's return started.
[00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:12.140]   Then remember, it was partly due to Microsoft putting $150 million into Apple.
[00:14:12.140 --> 00:14:13.140]   Yeah.
[00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:14.620]   What Apple was about to go bankrupt.
[00:14:14.620 --> 00:14:15.620]   More irony.
[00:14:15.620 --> 00:14:17.220]   Yeah, that keynote with Bill Gates.
[00:14:17.220 --> 00:14:18.220]   A giant Bill Gates.
[00:14:18.220 --> 00:14:21.540]   And then people brewing him.
[00:14:21.540 --> 00:14:25.780]   I am about to give you money.
[00:14:25.780 --> 00:14:30.940]   I feel strongly that without Microsoft providing a consistent platform, you don't have the
[00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:32.740]   growth of the '80s and '90s.
[00:14:32.740 --> 00:14:35.060]   And then, of course, what happened is you're right.
[00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:36.780]   Microsoft fumbled it for whatever reason.
[00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:38.980]   Maybe it's just the natural business cycle.
[00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:40.980]   And now we're looking for that platform.
[00:14:40.980 --> 00:14:42.700]   We don't have it anymore.
[00:14:42.700 --> 00:14:46.140]   People are rejecting, I believe, people are rejecting Windows 8.1.
[00:14:46.140 --> 00:14:48.140]   I don't think the iPad is a platform.
[00:14:48.140 --> 00:14:52.780]   It's certainly been successful for app developers, but it's not universal enough to be a dominant
[00:14:52.780 --> 00:14:53.780]   platform.
[00:14:53.780 --> 00:14:54.780]   Okay.
[00:14:54.780 --> 00:14:57.860]   I think the next platform is the cloud.
[00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:00.820]   But the problem is there's-- maybe it's Google's cloud.
[00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:01.820]   I don't know.
[00:15:01.820 --> 00:15:02.820]   What do you think, Tim?
[00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:09.460]   That's the case that you need a common platform for success in the industry.
[00:15:09.460 --> 00:15:11.100]   Yeah, you definitely do.
[00:15:11.100 --> 00:15:12.100]   And you also need competition.
[00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:13.100]   And that's the big thing.
[00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:16.580]   I mean, if you do eat Microsoft from the picture back in the history of personal computing,
[00:15:16.580 --> 00:15:19.100]   then that's a major player out of the equation.
[00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:21.460]   That doesn't force Apple to be as good as they had to be to be.
[00:15:21.460 --> 00:15:22.460]   That's a good point.
[00:15:22.460 --> 00:15:23.460]   Yeah.
[00:15:23.460 --> 00:15:24.980]   And so Apple could have gotten fat and lazy.
[00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:26.140]   And who knows what would have happened.
[00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:29.020]   But yeah, going forward, definitely platforms are shifting.
[00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:32.620]   And certainly iOS and Android are developing and becoming big.
[00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:37.500]   But the standardization interoperability that you're referencing, Leo, the standards
[00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:41.780]   that Microsoft put forth and the standards of development and the sort of things that
[00:15:41.780 --> 00:15:45.380]   developers could target for exchanging data, those sorts of things are kind of nascent at
[00:15:45.380 --> 00:15:48.060]   this point, still, especially when you talk about cloud computing.
[00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:50.620]   There's so many great services out there, but none of them talk to each other.
[00:15:50.620 --> 00:15:52.980]   And there's no way for any of them to talk to each other.
[00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:55.140]   Really, there's no standards in place at all.
[00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:56.140]   And we're a long way.
[00:15:56.140 --> 00:15:59.340]   Well, five, isn't that isn't that the promised standard?
[00:15:59.340 --> 00:16:01.380]   I mean, isn't that what we need?
[00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:03.060]   If you, but nobody's right in the.
[00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:04.940]   Do we need five years?
[00:16:04.940 --> 00:16:05.940]   That's been a promising.
[00:16:05.940 --> 00:16:06.940]   Do we need?
[00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:07.940]   Do we need anything?
[00:16:07.940 --> 00:16:10.180]   I mean, maybe we maybe the days of the platform room, who cares?
[00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:11.180]   I use a Kindle.
[00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:12.340]   I read books on it.
[00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:13.580]   I use this for something else.
[00:16:13.580 --> 00:16:14.580]   I use my segmentation.
[00:16:14.580 --> 00:16:16.980]   So what you get the lock in?
[00:16:16.980 --> 00:16:20.580]   Well, yeah, and you get law and you get ecosystem walk in.
[00:16:20.580 --> 00:16:21.580]   Right.
[00:16:21.580 --> 00:16:24.380]   No, I'm not locked into the Kindle.
[00:16:24.380 --> 00:16:26.060]   I mean, look at the nook, right?
[00:16:26.060 --> 00:16:29.820]   I mean, what's the, would you encourage anyone to go out and buy a nook right now?
[00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:31.340]   No, of course not.
[00:16:31.340 --> 00:16:32.340]   I wouldn't.
[00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:33.340]   But that's beside the.
[00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:34.340]   How long did that last?
[00:16:34.340 --> 00:16:36.980]   But you think you think we heard this brick and mortar store that I can walk in huge barns
[00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:40.700]   and no bolts crushing all these little bookstores in the towns, right?
[00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:43.220]   This massive story and going to coffees there.
[00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:44.220]   They're brilliant, right?
[00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:46.860]   Cause you'll sit there all day and drink coffee and just keep buying books.
[00:16:46.860 --> 00:16:49.780]   They come out with their own e-reader platform in the nook.
[00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:51.700]   This is a gold mine.
[00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:52.700]   It's crap.
[00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:55.940]   Have you read the Bradstone's everything story yet?
[00:16:55.940 --> 00:16:56.940]   No, no, no, no.
[00:16:56.940 --> 00:16:57.940]   Good Amazon book.
[00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:01.180]   Wait, I want to know what Clayton's who were what the points is he trying to make.
[00:17:01.180 --> 00:17:04.860]   Well, I was saying that, I mean, how long you say who cares about lock in?
[00:17:04.860 --> 00:17:05.860]   You know, I never said that.
[00:17:05.860 --> 00:17:08.140]   I said, I don't see, I don't see the lock in.
[00:17:08.140 --> 00:17:13.140]   I see somebody else coming along with a Kindle clone of some sort that might be better.
[00:17:13.140 --> 00:17:14.140]   Maybe not.
[00:17:14.140 --> 00:17:15.140]   I don't care.
[00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:16.140]   I like the Kindle.
[00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:17.340]   It's not an expensive product and it moves a lot of books.
[00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:18.340]   I'm sure.
[00:17:18.340 --> 00:17:19.740]   I mean, we got a dot what is it?
[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:20.740]   Dot Moby file.
[00:17:20.740 --> 00:17:22.620]   Let's say you buy all your books on Amazon.
[00:17:22.620 --> 00:17:29.780]   You know, well, let's say you do because for the sake of a guy.
[00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:30.780]   But okay.
[00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:32.060]   When the lock in, right?
[00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:36.060]   I mean, Kindle is the is the most popular ebook distribution platform.
[00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:37.060]   Is it not?
[00:17:37.060 --> 00:17:38.380]   So what happens?
[00:17:38.380 --> 00:17:41.180]   You know, it's his dot M O, you know, M O B.
[00:17:41.180 --> 00:17:43.540]   Yeah, it's a M O B. I actually.
[00:17:43.540 --> 00:17:44.540]   Yeah.
[00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:45.540]   And yeah, okay.
[00:17:45.540 --> 00:17:49.260]   So I got downloaded a book the other day and there's an e pub and I just ran it.
[00:17:49.260 --> 00:17:50.580]   There's a website online.
[00:17:50.580 --> 00:17:51.580]   I just typed it in.
[00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:52.580]   Boom.
[00:17:52.580 --> 00:17:53.780]   It came out as a Moby file and I put it on the Kindle.
[00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:54.780]   I read it.
[00:17:54.780 --> 00:17:55.780]   I don't see that.
[00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:56.780]   I don't matter.
[00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:57.780]   I don't feel locked in.
[00:17:57.780 --> 00:17:59.820]   I mean, there's all kinds of ways of getting around it.
[00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:03.340]   But if you buy a first party book, if you actually, you know, pay money for a book that
[00:18:03.340 --> 00:18:06.460]   you download from it, Amazon, it's going to be encrypted in such a way that you can't
[00:18:06.460 --> 00:18:08.620]   do that and put it on some other readers.
[00:18:08.620 --> 00:18:11.580]   So it's not so much the hardware that's going to go away, but it could be the platform
[00:18:11.580 --> 00:18:12.580]   that goes away.
[00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:16.020]   And if that platform goes away, then, you know, that content that you purchased goes
[00:18:16.020 --> 00:18:17.340]   away with that platform as well.
[00:18:17.340 --> 00:18:21.340]   And there's no way to do transfers of licenses or anything like that across these disparate
[00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:23.100]   books two or three times.
[00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:25.100]   But I mean, that's not unusual.
[00:18:25.100 --> 00:18:29.700]   The whole world's been headed toward this licensed lockdown DRM crap anyway.
[00:18:29.700 --> 00:18:30.700]   That's not a good thing.
[00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:31.700]   I know.
[00:18:31.700 --> 00:18:32.700]   I don't like that.
[00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:34.700]   But I don't think anything do.
[00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:38.180]   You think it should be one giant megalithic company.
[00:18:38.180 --> 00:18:39.180]   There's no fragmentation.
[00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:41.300]   No, there's just everybody should be some ogre.
[00:18:41.300 --> 00:18:42.300]   There's Google.
[00:18:42.300 --> 00:18:43.620]   There's definitely disadvantages to that.
[00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:45.220]   I'm not saying it might look a Microsoft.
[00:18:45.220 --> 00:18:50.900]   In fact, face the antitrust lawsuit from the Department of Justice in the late 90s because
[00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:51.900]   of this.
[00:18:51.900 --> 00:18:53.980]   But we gained a benefit from it.
[00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:56.500]   And I'm not saying it's what was the benefits.
[00:18:56.500 --> 00:19:01.220]   The benefit was if you're a developer, you could write a program and have a known potential
[00:19:01.220 --> 00:19:03.500]   user base of hundreds of millions.
[00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:09.220]   The platform was not a shifting sand, although later the Microsoft APIs did shift probably
[00:19:09.220 --> 00:19:10.940]   a little more than they ought to have.
[00:19:10.940 --> 00:19:13.260]   But it was a consistent platform that you could write for.
[00:19:13.260 --> 00:19:14.620]   And you knew you had a market.
[00:19:14.620 --> 00:19:19.100]   And I think that we saw an incredible blossoming of software in the 80s and 90s because of
[00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:20.260]   that.
[00:19:20.260 --> 00:19:21.860]   And I think that it's a little more fragmented.
[00:19:21.860 --> 00:19:26.620]   Now, if you're an iOS game developer, you're writing for that ecosystem.
[00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:27.860]   And it's not going to be on Android.
[00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:29.020]   It's not going to be on desktop.
[00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:30.660]   It's not going to be on HTML5.
[00:19:30.660 --> 00:19:37.060]   And so a lot of creativity and, you know, I think potentially very important software
[00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:38.060]   is dismissed.
[00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:43.260]   I think the reason for the huge boom that you talk about was because of the graphical
[00:19:43.260 --> 00:19:47.140]   user interface showing up and it created all these people with, because all these idiots
[00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:51.220]   who couldn't type DIR into a command line because it was too complicated.
[00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:52.300]   Well, I grew the market base.
[00:19:52.300 --> 00:19:53.300]   I agree.
[00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:54.380]   I grew the market base.
[00:19:54.380 --> 00:19:59.340]   This ball puts me in mind of Canarella and Speckler's epidemiological modeling of online
[00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:01.060]   social network dynamics.
[00:20:01.060 --> 00:20:02.060]   Perhaps you read that paper.
[00:20:02.060 --> 00:20:03.060]   Oh, brother.
[00:20:03.060 --> 00:20:04.060]   Okay.
[00:20:04.060 --> 00:20:05.900]   If you want to shut up the audience, it's fine.
[00:20:05.900 --> 00:20:08.620]   Listen, this is good.
[00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:13.540]   So basically they say Facebook is about to lose about 80% of its users.
[00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:14.540]   Good.
[00:20:14.540 --> 00:20:17.300]   Because they said essentially it acts like an infectious disease.
[00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:20.460]   It's not the first time we've used that model, you know, viral video.
[00:20:20.460 --> 00:20:22.700]   It spreads like a virus.
[00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:23.700]   I love this.
[00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:25.340]   This is a great study.
[00:20:25.340 --> 00:20:27.620]   It feels right, right?
[00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:29.380]   When you're reading it, it feels accurate.
[00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:33.420]   It feels like, you know what, you can't really explain why your friends are not using
[00:20:33.420 --> 00:20:34.820]   this thing anymore and why.
[00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:36.780]   But it just, you know, one of them.
[00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:38.580]   No one actually vocalizes it.
[00:20:38.580 --> 00:20:39.580]   Like they did with my space.
[00:20:39.580 --> 00:20:42.300]   It's just people just stopped using it.
[00:20:42.300 --> 00:20:45.180]   Everybody uses Facebook and everybody hates it.
[00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:46.260]   I don't use it.
[00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:47.260]   So that's not true.
[00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:48.260]   Okay.
[00:20:48.260 --> 00:20:49.740]   Almost everybody uses it.
[00:20:49.740 --> 00:20:52.020]   And those who do universally hate it.
[00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:56.140]   I don't go, because I love Facebook, I cannot wait to use Facebook.
[00:20:56.140 --> 00:20:57.140]   No, that's true.
[00:20:57.140 --> 00:20:58.140]   There's my wife would say that, but I don't.
[00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:00.340]   But you have to because that's where Aunt Maude is.
[00:21:00.340 --> 00:21:02.340]   I don't use Facebook and I hate it.
[00:21:02.340 --> 00:21:03.340]   So where do I fit in?
[00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:04.340]   You're an outlier.
[00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:05.340]   You've always been an outlier.
[00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:06.340]   I'm not lying at all.
[00:21:06.340 --> 00:21:07.820]   You're not a liar on the bell curve.
[00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:09.820]   You're a dot over in the upper right hand corner.
[00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:10.820]   No, no, no.
[00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:11.820]   Because where do you go?
[00:21:11.820 --> 00:21:12.820]   I mean, where do you go?
[00:21:12.820 --> 00:21:13.820]   You don't go to Google+.
[00:21:13.820 --> 00:21:14.820]   I love Google+.
[00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:15.820]   I don't like Google+, I love Google+.
[00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:16.820]   I love Google+.
[00:21:16.820 --> 00:21:17.820]   I love Google+.
[00:21:17.820 --> 00:21:18.820]   I'm with you.
[00:21:18.820 --> 00:21:24.260]   You know, my photography friends, like Trey Ratcliffe are over there, but my mom's not.
[00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:25.260]   Yeah.
[00:21:25.260 --> 00:21:26.260]   We should make that clear.
[00:21:26.260 --> 00:21:27.260]   Because people say no one's there.
[00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:28.460]   No, there's plenty of people there.
[00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:32.460]   Just not the family, not your high school buddies, not the people you want to connect
[00:21:32.460 --> 00:21:33.460]   with.
[00:21:33.460 --> 00:21:35.660]   They're all on Facebook, but they don't like it any more than you do.
[00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:44.100]   So these researchers presume or offer as a model this disease model and they say, what
[00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:47.660]   happens with diseases is they peak and then they die very rapidly.
[00:21:47.660 --> 00:21:48.660]   You get a fever.
[00:21:48.660 --> 00:21:53.460]   And the reason is because people, well, immunization happens.
[00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:55.340]   People get over the disease.
[00:21:55.340 --> 00:22:00.300]   And so they're saying that traditional model of disease spread, they're going to update
[00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:05.980]   it to assume that recovery from a disease like Facebook in the social context means
[00:22:05.980 --> 00:22:10.860]   you have to have contact with a non-diseased member, a non-user of Facebook, someone who
[00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:11.860]   is recovered.
[00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:12.940]   That would be, I've never recovered.
[00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:17.020]   So by context, I can barely have built in antibodies.
[00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:18.260]   They have modeled this.
[00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:19.820]   There's math.
[00:22:19.820 --> 00:22:21.180]   And you know, you could see the math.
[00:22:21.180 --> 00:22:22.180]   Yeah, they got math.
[00:22:22.180 --> 00:22:23.180]   That's...
[00:22:23.180 --> 00:22:24.180]   That means it's true.
[00:22:24.180 --> 00:22:25.900]   They've got search query data curve fitting.
[00:22:25.900 --> 00:22:26.900]   Science is in.
[00:22:26.900 --> 00:22:27.900]   Results and discussion.
[00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:32.100]   So they say that in the next two years, Facebook's going to lose 80% of its audience.
[00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:33.620]   Now this happened to my space.
[00:22:33.620 --> 00:22:37.180]   I would bet serious money that that's not going to happen.
[00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:39.500]   You see, I don't think I buy this for a couple reasons.
[00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:42.500]   The first thing is they liken this to the pattern that my space saw.
[00:22:42.500 --> 00:22:46.460]   And of course, my space did have a devastating loss of active users.
[00:22:46.460 --> 00:22:49.380]   But the reason, or one of the reasons that they did that was because Facebook came along
[00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:50.380]   and stuck along the way.
[00:22:50.380 --> 00:22:51.380]   Exactly.
[00:22:51.380 --> 00:22:53.380]   There's nothing that's coming and showing up that's really...
[00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:55.380]   Well, what's the way, what's the time?
[00:22:55.380 --> 00:22:56.380]   Snapchat.
[00:22:56.380 --> 00:22:57.380]   What is it?
[00:22:57.380 --> 00:22:58.980]   You know, all the kids are using now?
[00:22:58.980 --> 00:22:59.980]   Snapchat, Jon.
[00:22:59.980 --> 00:23:00.980]   Is that it?
[00:23:00.980 --> 00:23:02.820]   Oh, the kids are using it.
[00:23:02.820 --> 00:23:04.820]   Your uncle is non-snapchat.
[00:23:04.820 --> 00:23:08.740]   It's the same sort of thing that's presenting itself that's going to be replacing Facebook
[00:23:08.740 --> 00:23:09.740]   and Italian.
[00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:10.740]   Don't you think there will be?
[00:23:10.740 --> 00:23:11.740]   Don't you think there will be no tag?
[00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:12.740]   No, I don't think.
[00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:13.740]   At some point...
[00:23:13.740 --> 00:23:14.740]   I don't know.
[00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:17.820]   I mean, if there is, and it's going to have to be something completely different than what
[00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:21.100]   we see today, I don't see anything that's on the market right now replacing Facebook.
[00:23:21.100 --> 00:23:24.780]   I mean, certainly, like Clayton mentioned, Google+, I use Google+, a lot and I like it
[00:23:24.780 --> 00:23:27.340]   a lot, but it certainly doesn't fit the same template.
[00:23:27.340 --> 00:23:28.340]   Snapchat, I'm telling you.
[00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:31.180]   Keeping in touch with friends and that kind of thing.
[00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:34.900]   But the other thing is, you know, there are lots of things that have come along that have
[00:23:34.900 --> 00:23:38.060]   had these big booms of popularity and they didn't die out.
[00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:39.300]   I mean, think of internet usage.
[00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:42.700]   You could apply the same models to internet usage and certainly people haven't wandered
[00:23:42.700 --> 00:23:45.260]   away from the internet after using it for a couple of years.
[00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:50.180]   So I don't see what makes Facebook fit within this model that they're defining and other
[00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:52.460]   things that remain popular don't fit in.
[00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:54.340]   I don't see where the differentiation is.
[00:23:54.340 --> 00:23:58.860]   Well, the phrase people use is the network effect.
[00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:00.740]   You stay there because everybody else is there.
[00:24:00.740 --> 00:24:04.220]   And so there's a natural lock-in because it's where all my friends are.
[00:24:04.220 --> 00:24:05.420]   I'm telling you, the kids are out.
[00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:06.420]   They're done.
[00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:10.260]   But that's what I think that in time, that's what's going to happen.
[00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:13.740]   Maybe it's not Snapchat, maybe it's Instagram, maybe it's not Instagram, maybe it's fine.
[00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:15.740]   Or maybe it's none of the above.
[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:18.100]   What is it that we need and get from Facebook?
[00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:19.100]   Nothing.
[00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:20.660]   Yeah, that's one thing you're talking about the wrong guy.
[00:24:20.660 --> 00:24:25.420]   Facebook providing a core service and I don't see anything else really filling that void.
[00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:28.980]   Like, you know, bringing all those features together and keeping in touch with your family
[00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:30.140]   and your friends and everything else.
[00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:32.620]   I mean, to me, it's more like email and certainly people are sleeping on.
[00:24:32.620 --> 00:24:34.620]   How hard is a email?
[00:24:34.620 --> 00:24:36.420]   Email is going to go away.
[00:24:36.420 --> 00:24:38.460]   I don't even think that people are even using it for that.
[00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:42.380]   I mean, I guess they're using chat services on Facebook perhaps.
[00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:45.660]   But really, I think the thing that's taking off, I hear more and more people, the young
[00:24:45.660 --> 00:24:49.660]   kids, I hear them all around the offices are constantly talking about Instagram now in
[00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:51.980]   a way that I never really talking about it before.
[00:24:51.980 --> 00:24:53.300]   But Facebook owns it.
[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:55.780]   So hey, kudos to Facebook for buying Instagram.
[00:24:55.780 --> 00:24:56.780]   I agree with that.
[00:24:56.780 --> 00:24:59.300]   Because you know, that's all you need is a photo, a little comment here.
[00:24:59.300 --> 00:25:03.660]   You can now share directly with people individually, almost like Snapchat.
[00:25:03.660 --> 00:25:08.820]   So you maybe decline to Facebook isn't helping themselves by the changing and the algorithms
[00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:10.660]   of the news feed either.
[00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:12.260]   Because what you want in the news feed, isn't it?
[00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:13.660]   You want to see your family.
[00:25:13.660 --> 00:25:16.700]   You want instead you get all these up worthy buzzfeed.
[00:25:16.700 --> 00:25:17.700]   Craft.
[00:25:17.700 --> 00:25:18.700]   Craft.
[00:25:18.700 --> 00:25:19.700]   Craft.
[00:25:19.700 --> 00:25:20.700]   Craft.
[00:25:20.700 --> 00:25:24.620]   10 stories that prove that Bill Murray really is the most interesting man in the world.
[00:25:24.620 --> 00:25:25.620]   I don't want to see that.
[00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:27.780]   Then there's an ad for something I don't care about.
[00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:29.460]   Yeah, this you're the big Facebook user.
[00:25:29.460 --> 00:25:30.660]   So go on and bitch some more.
[00:25:30.660 --> 00:25:35.420]   Then there's another video by David Berlin of all people.
[00:25:35.420 --> 00:25:37.420]   Amazing and powerful street guitarist.
[00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:38.420]   Who cares?
[00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:39.420]   Right.
[00:25:39.420 --> 00:25:43.380]   And then there's a map of the known world as seen from Toronto.
[00:25:43.380 --> 00:25:44.380]   This is crap.
[00:25:44.380 --> 00:25:47.380]   A cat was left alone with a fussy baby.
[00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:50.540]   I was stunned by what happened last year.
[00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:51.860]   I want to see that.
[00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:56.500]   One other thing we're learning is that people reshare these without ever watching.
[00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:58.420]   Louis C. Kated a great bit.
[00:25:58.420 --> 00:26:02.020]   She says all people do is they see the slide and they go, Oh cute baby.
[00:26:02.020 --> 00:26:03.860]   And then they move on.
[00:26:03.860 --> 00:26:07.460]   He said, well, yeah, there's a bite done that actually.
[00:26:07.460 --> 00:26:08.460]   Yes.
[00:26:08.460 --> 00:26:09.980]   So let's see the cat and the fussy baby.
[00:26:09.980 --> 00:26:13.300]   Now they got me on the pet flow blog.
[00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:15.140]   You're part of the problem.
[00:26:15.140 --> 00:26:19.660]   And then look at that giant banner ad floating above you there.
[00:26:19.660 --> 00:26:20.660]   Yeah.
[00:26:20.660 --> 00:26:21.660]   Aren't I glad I.
[00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:22.660]   Oh, that's good.
[00:26:22.660 --> 00:26:23.660]   That is cute.
[00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:25.660]   It's going to scratch his eyes out.
[00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:29.540]   You know, I can't believe what's happening next.
[00:26:29.540 --> 00:26:31.300]   You won't believe what happens next.
[00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:33.460]   I just can't believe this.
[00:26:33.460 --> 00:26:37.300]   Jeff Jarvis says these are this is the and by the way, I'm starting to see it on CNN.
[00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:39.700]   I'm starting to see the legitimate news blogs.
[00:26:39.700 --> 00:26:43.780]   This is what's happening is they're writing headlines that tell you how to feel.
[00:26:43.780 --> 00:26:44.780]   Right?
[00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:45.780]   Interesting.
[00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:48.660]   You will be blown away by what happens next.
[00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:53.500]   You will be you will be brought to tears by what this homeless man told our reporters.
[00:26:53.500 --> 00:26:54.500]   This is becoming.
[00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:57.740]   Yeah, that's an interesting point.
[00:26:57.740 --> 00:26:59.820]   They put the cat put the kid to sleep, by the way.
[00:26:59.820 --> 00:27:01.660]   So we're just going to watch kitten videos.
[00:27:01.660 --> 00:27:05.580]   And now he's transferring all his cat brain to the little kid.
[00:27:05.580 --> 00:27:07.100]   I'll sleep sleep John.
[00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:08.100]   I beg you.
[00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:12.220]   The kid will be the will be thinking like a cat and he's actually infecting him.
[00:27:12.220 --> 00:27:14.020]   He's going to be a is probably a girl, baby.
[00:27:14.020 --> 00:27:15.020]   He has going to be a cat.
[00:27:15.020 --> 00:27:17.060]   This is the Vulcan mind meld.
[00:27:17.060 --> 00:27:18.700]   It's terrible.
[00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:20.620]   Now how long do baby souls?
[00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:24.380]   Okay, by the way, I guarantee you, nobody's ever seen this entire video immediately.
[00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:25.980]   I'm going to share that on Facebook.
[00:27:25.980 --> 00:27:27.980]   That's good.
[00:27:27.980 --> 00:27:33.340]   Anyway, I think Facebook's not doing itself a service because there's all this crap on
[00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:34.340]   your plasma.
[00:27:34.340 --> 00:27:36.140]   I mean, they're monitoring all of this, right?
[00:27:36.140 --> 00:27:38.860]   So it must be doing well for them.
[00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:43.900]   Is it doing better than the crappy ads and the nonstop apps that we saw being in display
[00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:44.900]   in our news feed?
[00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:47.060]   Is that was bad too?
[00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:48.860]   We hate it.
[00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:51.260]   Facebook's the thing you hate, but have to use.
[00:27:51.260 --> 00:27:52.260]   I don't know.
[00:27:52.260 --> 00:27:53.260]   No, I know a lot.
[00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:56.660]   In fact, Bert Montreux, the famous artist, don't be guy.
[00:27:56.660 --> 00:27:58.780]   He was talking about his house chatting with him.
[00:27:58.780 --> 00:27:59.940]   He doesn't use Facebook.
[00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:01.260]   He invited you over to his house.
[00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:03.900]   And I go over there once and we'll use this printer.
[00:28:03.900 --> 00:28:06.700]   It's got a big 44-incher printer.
[00:28:06.700 --> 00:28:08.340]   And his bidet.
[00:28:08.340 --> 00:28:10.860]   He doesn't have a bidet, but he's got a 40-page.
[00:28:10.860 --> 00:28:12.580]   And update on the Toyota toilet.
[00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:16.060]   The Toyota has agreed to exchange the top of the toilet.
[00:28:16.060 --> 00:28:17.060]   So that's good.
[00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:18.060]   What?
[00:28:18.060 --> 00:28:19.780]   There was a crack in your toilet.
[00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:20.780]   In my toilet.
[00:28:20.780 --> 00:28:22.140]   Oh, this is the $1,000, $10,000.
[00:28:22.140 --> 00:28:23.900]   $1,800 butt washer.
[00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:27.380]   It's the $1,800 with the button RT.
[00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:28.380]   Okay.
[00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:30.300]   Yes, it retweets.
[00:28:30.300 --> 00:28:31.300]   I'm good.
[00:28:31.300 --> 00:28:32.580]   Our show today brought to you.
[00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:33.580]   Thank you.
[00:28:33.580 --> 00:28:34.780]   We've got a great panel here.
[00:28:34.780 --> 00:28:38.100]   John C. Devorek, Tim Stevens from CNET, Mr. Clayton Morris.
[00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:40.820]   I want to find out about the gluten, the new ebook, the gluten-free.
[00:28:40.820 --> 00:28:45.700]   I think it's time the ebooks did not have gluten in them.
[00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:49.180]   No, tonight only for a Twitter audience, it's free.
[00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:51.420]   I wrote a short ebooks like 35 pages.
[00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:52.420]   It's free.
[00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:53.740]   It's called, it's free right now.
[00:28:53.740 --> 00:28:54.740]   Go download it.
[00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:55.740]   Please, I would love to.
[00:28:55.740 --> 00:28:56.740]   Wait, where is it?
[00:28:56.740 --> 00:28:57.740]   80 pounds.
[00:28:57.740 --> 00:28:58.740]   It's called, "Why gluten-free?"
[00:28:58.740 --> 00:28:59.740]   It's called, "Why gluten-free?"
[00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:00.740]   The question mark.
[00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:01.740]   Why gluten-free?
[00:29:01.740 --> 00:29:03.780]   He was grotesquely fat.
[00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:04.780]   I was.
[00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:05.780]   I was just.
[00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:09.620]   And it's like the Susan Powder nonsense, remember her?
[00:29:09.620 --> 00:29:13.500]   We, you know, there were a number of people around me that had the celiac, but we went
[00:29:13.500 --> 00:29:15.820]   low-carb in our family like last year and now we're searching for again.
[00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:16.820]   Is this different from low-carb?
[00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:20.140]   Because if you don't eat carbs, you're not going to get gluten, right?
[00:29:20.140 --> 00:29:23.140]   Well, no, I mean, the thing is you'll find gluten and coffee.
[00:29:23.140 --> 00:29:24.780]   You'll find it in crappy coffee.
[00:29:24.780 --> 00:29:25.780]   No.
[00:29:25.780 --> 00:29:26.780]   Yes, you will.
[00:29:26.780 --> 00:29:28.980]   You'll find it as filler in crappy coffee.
[00:29:28.980 --> 00:29:30.780]   Well, I don't drink crappy coffee.
[00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:31.780]   Coffee.
[00:29:31.780 --> 00:29:32.780]   That's crappy coffee.
[00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:34.620]   What kind of coffee you drink and that has gluten in it?
[00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:38.500]   This is like, what are you, this is Dunkin Donuts coffee.
[00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:41.900]   My old coat, no, in fact, Dunkin Donuts does not have gluten in it, but you know that
[00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:44.460]   Oban Pawn, that French.
[00:29:44.460 --> 00:29:45.980]   Yeah, Oban Pawn.
[00:29:45.980 --> 00:29:46.980]   Yeah.
[00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:51.180]   So my close friend who was celiac took him years to figure out what it was, finally
[00:29:51.180 --> 00:29:54.460]   was diagnosed and he would just be in double pain constant.
[00:29:54.460 --> 00:29:55.980]   No, there's a horrible thing now.
[00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:56.980]   Horrible ale.
[00:29:56.980 --> 00:29:57.980]   Horrible.
[00:29:57.980 --> 00:29:59.820]   He finally figured out and he got off of it.
[00:29:59.820 --> 00:30:03.060]   He finally got off of gluten, but then he would still have some coffee in the morning
[00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:06.460]   in the green room and couldn't figure out why.
[00:30:06.460 --> 00:30:07.940]   Well, he was still having the stomach pain.
[00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:09.260]   He's the cheesy coffee.
[00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:11.340]   Fox and Friends is serving.
[00:30:11.340 --> 00:30:12.340]   Not anymore.
[00:30:12.340 --> 00:30:13.340]   Not anymore.
[00:30:13.340 --> 00:30:20.540]   So really you were getting your catering from Oban Pawn and it had gluten in the coffee.
[00:30:20.540 --> 00:30:21.540]   He was sneaking.
[00:30:21.540 --> 00:30:22.540]   I had a cupcake.
[00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:23.540]   No, again, that's not.
[00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:24.540]   There's no.
[00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:25.740]   And what else has gluten in it?
[00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:27.340]   Who else has gluten in it?
[00:30:27.340 --> 00:30:28.340]   Shampoo.
[00:30:28.340 --> 00:30:29.340]   You'd be surprised to learn.
[00:30:29.340 --> 00:30:30.340]   Yeah, but not hoozy.
[00:30:30.340 --> 00:30:31.340]   Shampoo.
[00:30:31.340 --> 00:30:32.340]   Nobody's eating shampoo.
[00:30:32.340 --> 00:30:33.340]   And toothpaste.
[00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:35.060]   But some of that, some of that banana shampoo you want to eat.
[00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:38.940]   But beyond that, we're now seeing in Dr. David Perlmutter, who's like one of the leading neurologists
[00:30:38.940 --> 00:30:41.380]   in the world, has written a fantastic book.
[00:30:41.380 --> 00:30:45.780]   It's been number one on Amazon, New York Times bestseller called Grain Brain.
[00:30:45.780 --> 00:30:53.860]   And he, all research, all science is now pointing to the fact that Alzheimer's dementia is inflammation
[00:30:53.860 --> 00:30:54.860]   of the brain.
[00:30:54.860 --> 00:31:00.740]   He'd be directly tied to, tied to gluten and wheat allergies as an inflammation.
[00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:01.940]   His research is pretty overwhelming.
[00:31:01.940 --> 00:31:04.340]   I've interviewed him a couple of times on the show.
[00:31:04.340 --> 00:31:05.780]   He has been on the Dr. Oz show.
[00:31:05.780 --> 00:31:06.780]   It's been remarkable.
[00:31:06.780 --> 00:31:09.300]   And there's been a number of books on this as well.
[00:31:09.300 --> 00:31:14.500]   Dr. Richard Lustig's book on sugar and Gary Talb's book on why we get fat.
[00:31:14.500 --> 00:31:15.500]   I love Gary Talb's stuff.
[00:31:15.500 --> 00:31:17.940]   And, you know, Gibson's been big on this.
[00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:19.100]   But he's focused on gluten.
[00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:20.900]   He's focused just on carbs in general.
[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:21.900]   Yeah.
[00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:23.700]   But gluten is like the gift that culprit.
[00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:24.700]   He did what?
[00:31:24.700 --> 00:31:26.940]   It took 25 hours show of all this stuff.
[00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:28.860]   He was the longest show in the world.
[00:31:28.860 --> 00:31:29.860]   Oh my God.
[00:31:29.860 --> 00:31:30.860]   But he's healthy.
[00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:35.580]   So it's on Amazon why gluten free is simple guy to living gluten free.
[00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:38.820]   It's only it's only 35 pages and it's absolutely fine.
[00:31:38.820 --> 00:31:40.820]   I'm going to put it on my Kindle right now.
[00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:42.180]   Well, thank you very much.
[00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:43.180]   Yeah.
[00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:44.180]   I'm going to go put it on my Kindle.
[00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:45.180]   That I have.
[00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:46.180]   The very well, the whole thing about my Kindle.
[00:31:46.180 --> 00:31:48.060]   You have to see this.
[00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:49.060]   He has a hundred Kindle.
[00:31:49.060 --> 00:31:51.660]   I could put it on any one of my kindles.
[00:31:51.660 --> 00:31:52.660]   Any one of them.
[00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:53.660]   If you're by a Kindle, yeah.
[00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:54.660]   I'll put it on.
[00:31:54.660 --> 00:31:55.820]   Should I put it on my seventh Kindle?
[00:31:55.820 --> 00:31:56.820]   My fifth Kindle?
[00:31:56.820 --> 00:31:58.380]   How about my tenth Android?
[00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:00.820]   How about my twenty fifth and you're a hoarder?
[00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:04.220]   How about wait with my thirty eighth Android?
[00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:05.220]   I'm going to put it on there.
[00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:06.220]   I don't even know what that is.
[00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:07.780]   Go where's a real Kindle on here?
[00:32:07.780 --> 00:32:08.780]   That's what you want.
[00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:10.740]   Oh, the sixth Kindle, seventh Kindle, eighth Kindle.
[00:32:10.740 --> 00:32:12.060]   You have a paper white?
[00:32:12.060 --> 00:32:13.060]   I probably do.
[00:32:13.060 --> 00:32:14.060]   They don't tell you that.
[00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:17.260]   They just say which, you know, they just says paper white on the list.
[00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:18.260]   It does?
[00:32:18.260 --> 00:32:19.260]   Yeah.
[00:32:19.260 --> 00:32:20.260]   That's when my expert.
[00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:23.100]   No, my two cents is an ordinal number about which Kindle I got.
[00:32:23.100 --> 00:32:24.100]   You must have named it.
[00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:25.100]   All right.
[00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:26.100]   I'm going to put it on my seventh Kindle.
[00:32:26.100 --> 00:32:27.100]   I'm going to go order it myself.
[00:32:27.100 --> 00:32:28.100]   Thank you very much.
[00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:29.100]   Yes.
[00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:30.100]   It's done.
[00:32:30.100 --> 00:32:31.100]   I'm going to go to credit.
[00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:33.860]   Are you going to go to heaven because of this or I mean it's just, you know, money.
[00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:34.860]   What's the name of this?
[00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:35.860]   Well, no, it's free.
[00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:38.660]   I'm just, you know, I think the information, it's free for tonight.
[00:32:38.660 --> 00:32:41.460]   And then I think it flips back to whatever it is tomorrow.
[00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:42.460]   I'll wait now.
[00:32:42.460 --> 00:32:44.060]   We'll read it tonight.
[00:32:44.060 --> 00:32:45.060]   Thank you very much.
[00:32:45.060 --> 00:32:46.060]   I would read it today.
[00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:47.060]   Is that the problem?
[00:32:47.060 --> 00:32:48.900]   No, I don't want to get this in my coffee.
[00:32:48.900 --> 00:32:55.460]   I just want to get this information out there because there's so, there's so much ignorance
[00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:56.460]   about it.
[00:32:56.460 --> 00:32:57.460]   I think it would really help a lot.
[00:32:57.460 --> 00:32:58.460]   Wait until my vinegar comes out.
[00:32:58.460 --> 00:32:59.460]   Same thing.
[00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:01.180]   Where is your vinegar book?
[00:33:01.180 --> 00:33:02.340]   I'm an idiot.
[00:33:02.340 --> 00:33:04.180]   I can't seem to finish anything.
[00:33:04.180 --> 00:33:05.780]   The mother of all mothers.
[00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:08.180]   All right, I'm getting this right.
[00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:09.180]   Let's take a break.
[00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:15.780]   We want to talk some more with Clayton Morris, Fox and friends, John C. Devorak channel Devorak.org.
[00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:19.420]   And of course, knowagendocho.com.
[00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:20.540]   And from CNET, Tim Stevens.
[00:33:20.540 --> 00:33:22.660]   What are you doing at CNET these days?
[00:33:22.660 --> 00:33:23.660]   Have you done the car?
[00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:25.660]   Are you starting to do the car show yet?
[00:33:25.660 --> 00:33:28.700]   Actually, I want to talk about my ebook that I have coming up.
[00:33:28.700 --> 00:33:31.380]   It's about how to teach your cat to soothe your baby.
[00:33:31.380 --> 00:33:34.180]   It's called, "You Won't Believe What Happens Next."
[00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:36.060]   And it's coming to the Facebook feed me.
[00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:37.780]   I think that's good.
[00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:40.540]   You know you put some fish sauce on the baby's forehead.
[00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:41.540]   Is the key.
[00:33:41.540 --> 00:33:42.540]   It's the whole.
[00:33:42.540 --> 00:33:43.540]   It's easy.
[00:33:43.540 --> 00:33:44.540]   By the way, can I just say awesome to Twitter audiences?
[00:33:44.540 --> 00:33:47.540]   It was ranked 1,000 in Amazon.
[00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:50.660]   And it's now down to ranking 500 in just two minutes.
[00:33:50.660 --> 00:33:52.700]   We cut arm half.
[00:33:52.700 --> 00:33:53.700]   Holy cow.
[00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:54.700]   It's free.
[00:33:54.700 --> 00:33:55.700]   Everybody should get one.
[00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:57.020]   You know, be down to 100 shortly.
[00:33:57.020 --> 00:33:58.260]   Where do you see the guys are amazing?
[00:33:58.260 --> 00:34:02.660]   You know, so I'm reading this everything store book about Bezos.
[00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:06.420]   And that was something they did very early on Amazon was put the author ranking.
[00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:09.420]   And they knew that authors would spend all day looking at their range.
[00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:12.060]   Refreshing the page of my number one, where am I?
[00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:15.540]   So do you have a special app that tells you what your rank is?
[00:34:15.540 --> 00:34:17.660]   No, just within the Amazon story.
[00:34:17.660 --> 00:34:18.660]   Oh, it's 552.
[00:34:18.660 --> 00:34:22.220]   Yeah, it was over 1,000 just about two minutes ago.
[00:34:22.220 --> 00:34:23.220]   So I think you have it.
[00:34:23.220 --> 00:34:24.220]   So it's very kind of you.
[00:34:24.220 --> 00:34:27.060]   So two copies and dropped it from 1,000 of this.
[00:34:27.060 --> 00:34:28.060]   This is awesome.
[00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:29.060]   Fantastic.
[00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:31.060]   This is awesome.
[00:34:31.060 --> 00:34:35.180]   And as Fox Junkie said, this book tells one all they need to know if they have a question
[00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:37.180]   what it is.
[00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:38.180]   What?
[00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:39.380]   Yeah, that's misspelled.
[00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:42.380]   Thanks to me.
[00:34:42.380 --> 00:34:46.860]   Need some work.

[00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:51.220]   Check for grammar.
[00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:54.860]   Please get this book tells one all they need to know if they have a question.
[00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:55.860]   What it is.
[00:34:55.860 --> 00:34:58.140]   I can't even read it without laughing.
[00:34:58.140 --> 00:34:59.460]   I don't want to write a review.
[00:34:59.460 --> 00:35:01.380]   Please just make sure you get it spelled check.
[00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:02.380]   Spell check, please.
[00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:03.580]   That's more than spelled check.
[00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:06.140]   Our show today, there's something else wrong here too.
[00:35:06.140 --> 00:35:08.740]   Our show today brought to you by our friends at Citrix.
[00:35:08.740 --> 00:35:10.860]   Go to meeting with HD faces.
[00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:15.380]   It is the powerfully simple way to meet with clients and coworkers anywhere.
[00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:21.260]   We're in the middle of a weather, a winter that is just the worst ever, it seems to me.

[00:35:24.860 --> 00:35:25.860]   had the flu.
[00:35:25.860 --> 00:35:28.620]   Roads are closed, flights get canceled, people stay homesick.

[00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:31.740]   You're watching this week in tech.
[00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:34.260]   It was hard to get people last week.
[00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:37.020]   Nobody wanted to be on the show because of the football game.
[00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:40.820]   And I imagine next week we're going to have trouble again.
[00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:42.780]   I don't know why.
[00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:45.860]   Are you Clayton, are you rooting for anybody now?
[00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:47.900]   I just love a good football game.
[00:36:47.900 --> 00:36:49.260]   Here's what I'm rooting for.
[00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:52.420]   I'm rooting for a winter storm during the game.
[00:36:52.420 --> 00:36:53.420]   What were they thinking?
[00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:55.180]   For now, let me say this.
[00:36:55.180 --> 00:36:56.180]   It's freezing here.
[00:36:56.180 --> 00:37:00.500]   Now I live a stone's throw, literally a stone's throw from Rutherford, New Jersey, where
[00:37:00.500 --> 00:37:01.740]   the game will be played.
[00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:04.100]   And the whole city right now is preparing me in Times Square.
[00:37:04.100 --> 00:37:08.100]   They're building all the scaffolding for their building a ski slope in Times Square for the
[00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:09.100]   big event.
[00:37:09.100 --> 00:37:10.660]   They're really concerned.
[00:37:10.660 --> 00:37:13.900]   They're trying to get all these hoity-toity rich people to start using public transportation
[00:37:13.900 --> 00:37:14.900]   for the game.
[00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:18.380]   Today, we had a guy on the show from seedgeek.com.
[00:37:18.380 --> 00:37:20.900]   And they're saying that the cheapest seats were like 2,500.
[00:37:20.900 --> 00:37:23.620]   Yeah, they're like an aggregator, like the kayak of tickets.
[00:37:23.620 --> 00:37:26.180]   It's really expensive because I looked.
[00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:28.260]   $2,500 for the cheapest seats.
[00:37:28.260 --> 00:37:30.540]   But he says in like a few days, they already dropped $1,000.
[00:37:30.540 --> 00:37:32.540]   And he says that you see this.
[00:37:32.540 --> 00:37:36.220]   It's not because, you know, the teams, he said it's not as a result of the teams or
[00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:40.380]   anything, that you always see this right before an event that literally wait to the day before
[00:37:40.380 --> 00:37:41.380]   an event.
[00:37:41.380 --> 00:37:44.740]   Oh, get the best possible price on your tickets the day before an event.
[00:37:44.740 --> 00:37:47.660]   They got a dump unload.
[00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:48.660]   That's really interesting.
[00:37:48.660 --> 00:37:49.900]   So there are seats available.
[00:37:49.900 --> 00:37:52.820]   Yeah, some of the seats are less expensive now.
[00:37:52.820 --> 00:37:53.820]   The good seats are going to be expensive.
[00:37:53.820 --> 00:37:56.220]   Well, what's the goal to this game when it's better on TV?
[00:37:56.220 --> 00:37:57.220]   Right.
[00:37:57.220 --> 00:37:58.220]   I want to score football games.
[00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:02.060]   But the reason the AFC and the NFC Championship games are so entertaining to watch on television
[00:38:02.060 --> 00:38:05.660]   is because there's usually a snowstorm at one of the games.
[00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:06.660]   Right.
[00:38:06.660 --> 00:38:07.660]   It just makes it so entertaining.
[00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:09.860]   And then when you get the Super Bowl, it's in a dome and it's warm and there's no
[00:38:09.860 --> 00:38:11.860]   ensuring it's all corporate types.
[00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:12.860]   It's cool.
[00:38:12.860 --> 00:38:13.860]   This, I hope, will be.
[00:38:13.860 --> 00:38:15.100]   At least I'll get some of the excitement back.
[00:38:15.100 --> 00:38:17.700]   You saw that Philadelphia game earlier this season.
[00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:18.700]   Oh, my God.
[00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:23.180]   It was snow blow the lines on the field so that people knew where the hell they were.
[00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:24.940]   Yeah, they'll be playing downtown.
[00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:25.940]   I don't know.
[00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:28.660]   NFL Red Zone, you know, the zone station.
[00:38:28.660 --> 00:38:32.780]   So they had a quad box up and it was all four snow games simultaneously.
[00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:33.780]   Oh, wow.
[00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:39.060]   One in Green Bay, the one in Pittsburgh, the one in Philadelphia, and it was just a white
[00:38:39.060 --> 00:38:40.060]   out and one in Washington.
[00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:44.420]   For years, they had the Super Bowl and warm weather climates or domes.
[00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:46.780]   I don't know why they're doing it at this giant stadium.
[00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:49.220]   They've decided to open it up so they can get.
[00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:50.220]   It's like the Olympics.
[00:38:50.220 --> 00:38:51.220]   Yeah.
[00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:52.220]   You know, you want to get it.
[00:38:52.220 --> 00:38:53.460]   So now they're going to have green.
[00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:55.460]   They expect to do one in Chicago.
[00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:56.460]   Oh, no.
[00:38:56.460 --> 00:38:58.500]   They expect to do one in maybe even in Green Bay.
[00:38:58.500 --> 00:39:00.060]   That's crazy.
[00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:02.820]   But that's the appeal of like the winter classic, you know, the hockey game that play
[00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:03.820]   on New Year's Day.
[00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:05.300]   You want to see it?
[00:39:05.300 --> 00:39:09.180]   It draws some excitement and I think it's in an area where, you know, they haven't had
[00:39:09.180 --> 00:39:10.380]   the Super Bowl here.
[00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:11.380]   So it's pretty exciting.
[00:39:11.380 --> 00:39:12.380]   Yeah.
[00:39:12.380 --> 00:39:14.100]   Good news for Cheryl Sandberg.
[00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:18.260]   She is the COO, Chief Operating Officer of Facebook, even though Facebook's going to be
[00:39:18.260 --> 00:39:19.660]   nothing in two years.
[00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:20.660]   The lean in girl.
[00:39:20.660 --> 00:39:22.340]   She's, she's, don't say girl.
[00:39:22.340 --> 00:39:23.420]   She's leaning in.
[00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:24.420]   She's a linen person.
[00:39:24.420 --> 00:39:25.420]   Okay.
[00:39:25.420 --> 00:39:26.420]   She's the lean in person.
[00:39:26.420 --> 00:39:27.420]   She's also a billionaire.
[00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:28.420]   Yeah.
[00:39:28.420 --> 00:39:29.420]   The youngest billionaire in the country.
[00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:30.420]   Thanks.
[00:39:30.420 --> 00:39:31.420]   How is she?
[00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:32.420]   She's under 30.
[00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:33.420]   Really?
[00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:34.420]   She looks like she's about 40.
[00:39:34.420 --> 00:39:35.420]   She's 30ish.
[00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:36.420]   Huh.
[00:39:36.420 --> 00:39:37.420]   You're such a pig.
[00:39:37.420 --> 00:39:38.420]   What?
[00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:39.420]   Don't be a pig.
[00:39:39.420 --> 00:39:40.420]   I'm not a pig.
[00:39:40.420 --> 00:39:42.820]   She has just made a deal also with Sony Pictures.
[00:39:42.820 --> 00:39:43.820]   No.
[00:39:43.820 --> 00:39:46.500]   Do a movie based on leaning.
[00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:47.500]   That'll be great.
[00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:48.500]   How's that even a movie?
[00:39:48.500 --> 00:39:50.540]   It's going to be, it might be a documentary.
[00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:51.540]   Is Nora Efron dead?
[00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:52.540]   Is she, could she write this?
[00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:53.540]   Because she could make it.
[00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:55.180]   She could make something out of it.
[00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:57.340]   I think she, I think Plucky, she's a great girl.
[00:39:57.340 --> 00:39:58.340]   We get, what's her name?
[00:39:58.340 --> 00:39:59.340]   The one with the Pout?
[00:39:59.340 --> 00:40:00.780]   You said the word girl.
[00:40:00.780 --> 00:40:01.780]   But this is different.
[00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:02.780]   It's a movie.
[00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:03.780]   You said, and Hathaway.
[00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:04.780]   And Hathaway.
[00:40:04.780 --> 00:40:05.780]   Oh, there you go.
[00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:06.780]   Now you're talking.
[00:40:06.780 --> 00:40:07.780]   My secret girlfriend.
[00:40:07.780 --> 00:40:08.780]   She would be good.
[00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:10.780]   But then there's no one who's the Pouty one.
[00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:12.460]   There's a bunch of those Pouty ones.
[00:40:12.460 --> 00:40:13.460]   I don't know.
[00:40:13.460 --> 00:40:14.460]   Angelina Jolie?
[00:40:14.460 --> 00:40:15.460]   No, she's not.
[00:40:15.460 --> 00:40:16.460]   I know what you're thinking.
[00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:17.460]   Are you thinking of Charlize?
[00:40:17.460 --> 00:40:18.460]   No, not Charlize.
[00:40:18.460 --> 00:40:19.460]   The other one.
[00:40:19.460 --> 00:40:20.460]   Not Scarlett Johansson.
[00:40:20.460 --> 00:40:21.460]   No, never.
[00:40:21.460 --> 00:40:22.780]   She was, who cares?
[00:40:22.780 --> 00:40:24.860]   She was in Jerry Maguire.
[00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:29.020]   She's the one who said you had me a good bye or whatever it was.
[00:40:29.020 --> 00:40:34.060]   The studio has set Nell Scoville, the writer and director, TV writer and director, to
[00:40:34.060 --> 00:40:35.060]   write the script.
[00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:36.060]   She helped to write the book.
[00:40:36.060 --> 00:40:37.060]   Renee Zellweger.
[00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:39.540]   Renee Zellweger, thank you.
[00:40:39.540 --> 00:40:43.180]   The film is not a biography of Sandberg.
[00:40:43.180 --> 00:40:47.820]   Scoville will hatch a narrative film from the themes contained within the book.
[00:40:47.820 --> 00:40:49.300]   Well, please.
[00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:52.980]   She's going to be even richer.
[00:40:52.980 --> 00:40:53.980]   Gmail was down.
[00:40:53.980 --> 00:40:54.980]   Call.
[00:40:54.980 --> 00:40:56.540]   Yahoo did a worldwide panic.
[00:40:56.540 --> 00:40:57.540]   Yeah.
[00:40:57.540 --> 00:40:58.540]   How long?
[00:40:58.540 --> 00:40:59.540]   Was it an hour?
[00:40:59.540 --> 00:41:01.540]   Almost an hour, yeah.
[00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:02.580]   Yahoo.
[00:41:02.580 --> 00:41:05.820]   Probably not a good idea.
[00:41:05.820 --> 00:41:09.620]   Poked fun on Twitter.
[00:41:09.620 --> 00:41:10.620]   What did they say?
[00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:16.460]   Well, they just said, gmells down and they link to a photo of the Gmail down, being down,
[00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:20.300]   which of course, first of all, was down for days, right?
[00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:21.300]   Right.
[00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:23.380]   But, you know, where does that kind of stuff get vetted in house?
[00:41:23.380 --> 00:41:28.340]   I mean, here's another, here's another example of a, you know, one hand of a corporation,
[00:41:28.340 --> 00:41:33.180]   not knowing what the other hand is doing, be on board with your social media strategy.
[00:41:33.180 --> 00:41:34.180]   Who's handling that?
[00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:35.180]   Yeah.
[00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:39.140]   How high up the flagpole does that go?
[00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:42.340]   You got to figure you Marissa Meyer, somebody didn't run into Marissa Meyer, said, can I
[00:41:42.340 --> 00:41:43.340]   tweet this?
[00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:44.340]   Right.
[00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:49.380]   She certainly would have said, no, they've got obviously a social media, probably department.
[00:41:49.380 --> 00:41:50.380]   And they stumble.
[00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:54.940]   I can imagine the call they got from Marissa shortly thereafter.
[00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:55.940]   Screaming.
[00:41:55.940 --> 00:41:58.540]   I always love the panic though when these sorts of things go down.
[00:41:58.540 --> 00:42:02.420]   And I, you know, I know people get frustrated because it's for their business and they're
[00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:08.460]   dealing with, but think about the infrastructure that is delayed on a regular basis.
[00:42:08.460 --> 00:42:12.780]   The taking the train to the city on a regular basis is late one or two times a week.
[00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:13.780]   Right.
[00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:14.780]   Without fail.
[00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:15.780]   Right.
[00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:16.780]   The subway is late on a regular basis.
[00:42:16.780 --> 00:42:19.300]   The elevator you're waiting to get on to go up to your meeting is late.
[00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:22.300]   How often are you texting someone to tell them that you're running behind for a meeting
[00:42:22.300 --> 00:42:27.340]   because of some sort of infrastructure, you know, being behind?
[00:42:27.340 --> 00:42:30.100]   So Gmail goes down and there's worldwide panic.
[00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:33.860]   And everyone starts to talk about, should we move off of Gmail to some other email service
[00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:34.860]   now?
[00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:35.860]   I don't know.
[00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:36.860]   Did you see that?
[00:42:36.860 --> 00:42:37.860]   Because I would.
[00:42:37.860 --> 00:42:40.140]   And, you know, Google plus was down also.
[00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:43.140]   And I didn't see anybody saying anything.
[00:42:43.140 --> 00:42:46.100]   So Yahoo did apologize.
[00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:51.300]   They said earlier today, a tweet that reflected bad judgment was posted and has been deleted.
[00:42:51.300 --> 00:42:54.380]   We apologize to Google and the Gmail team.
[00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:56.820]   Now that I think was a mistake.
[00:42:56.820 --> 00:43:02.980]   Oh my God.
[00:43:02.980 --> 00:43:06.220]   Tim is just falling into a hole.
[00:43:06.220 --> 00:43:08.140]   Tim's using Gmail.
[00:43:08.140 --> 00:43:11.980]   He's shape shifting ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:15.820]   Oh, Tim, this is sad because I want to hear what you have to say here.
[00:43:15.820 --> 00:43:17.820]   But your shape shift.
[00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:18.820]   Hello.
[00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:26.420]   This reminds me early on into it when you had a technical difficulty and we ended up having
[00:43:26.420 --> 00:43:30.540]   you type your things and I read them into the transcript.
[00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:31.540]   You made this up.
[00:43:31.540 --> 00:43:32.540]   No, you don't remember that?
[00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:33.540]   No.
[00:43:33.540 --> 00:43:34.540]   Oh, yeah.
[00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:36.180]   It was like Twit four or something.
[00:43:36.180 --> 00:43:37.740]   And it was really early on.
[00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:43.180]   And I remember sitting up in the cottage up in the attic there and we lost John.
[00:43:43.180 --> 00:43:44.820]   Yeah, I tried to check in.
[00:43:44.820 --> 00:43:47.620]   I were typing in and I started reading your comments.
[00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:49.220]   Well, you know, I came back.
[00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:50.620]   Not the record reflected.
[00:43:50.620 --> 00:43:56.020]   Mr. Devorek said, eh, never did figure out.
[00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:58.420]   Because your invitation to me by.
[00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:00.420]   Just like him, isn't it?
[00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:01.420]   No.
[00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:06.220]   The number of times I say, eh, is very minimal.
[00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:09.780]   I have a little sound board full of a Tim.
[00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:11.340]   Are you back?
[00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:12.340]   I don't know.
[00:44:12.340 --> 00:44:13.340]   Am I back?
[00:44:13.340 --> 00:44:14.340]   Do I still look like a retilium?
[00:44:14.340 --> 00:44:15.340]   A little bit.
[00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:17.300]   You know, the last time you were on you, you'd licked it somehow.
[00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:19.700]   You got some new my phy thing or?
[00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:23.340]   Yeah, I'm on time order now and I'm running a speed test right now and it's showing I
[00:44:23.340 --> 00:44:25.540]   have 30 megs down and five up.
[00:44:25.540 --> 00:44:26.540]   Yeah, lies lies.
[00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:27.540]   Lies.
[00:44:27.540 --> 00:44:29.540]   Damn dirty lies.
[00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:31.380]   Well, we can understand you.
[00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:33.780]   So go ahead and what were you saying about the Yahoo thing?
[00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:34.780]   I don't know.
[00:44:34.780 --> 00:44:35.780]   I don't know.
[00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:39.620]   I think Yahoo could have spun this by simply saying that they were trying to provide a
[00:44:39.620 --> 00:44:41.580]   news update to their users.
[00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:44.980]   You know, by apologizing, it made it look like they were trying to poke fun at Google.
[00:44:44.980 --> 00:44:47.060]   They simply said, hey, we're just providing an update.
[00:44:47.060 --> 00:44:48.060]   Right.
[00:44:48.060 --> 00:44:50.780]   We thought people would want to know because everybody, I mean, see that certainly tweeted
[00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:51.980]   about Gmail being down.
[00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:52.980]   Yeah.
[00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:55.340]   And I think it did as well in a gazula by AOL.
[00:44:55.340 --> 00:45:00.020]   AOL has their own mail service, but nobody thought that gadget was poking fun at Gino.
[00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:01.020]   I don't think so.
[00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:03.020]   I think that would have been a better response for them rather than.
[00:45:03.020 --> 00:45:04.020]   Absolutely.
[00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:05.020]   Apologize.
[00:45:05.020 --> 00:45:06.020]   Never admit it.
[00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:08.620]   In other words, spin it.
[00:45:08.620 --> 00:45:09.620]   Spin it.
[00:45:09.620 --> 00:45:10.620]   Don't admit it.
[00:45:10.620 --> 00:45:11.860]   Maybe they were doing that as a matter of fact.
[00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:12.860]   We don't know.
[00:45:12.860 --> 00:45:13.860]   It didn't go yet.
[00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:14.860]   Yeah.
[00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:15.860]   There was no snark.
[00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:16.860]   There was no smiley face.
[00:45:16.860 --> 00:45:18.820]   There was no mocking of them.
[00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:21.820]   So for them to apologize was the maybe that was the.
[00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:25.340]   We apologize for keeping you up to date.
[00:45:25.340 --> 00:45:28.740]   Marissa Ben called him, then said, get in here.
[00:45:28.740 --> 00:45:29.740]   You apologized.
[00:45:29.740 --> 00:45:31.740]   I don't know.
[00:45:31.740 --> 00:45:36.540]   Hey, you know, she and her in her CES keynote said that, you know, they're in the, they're
[00:45:36.540 --> 00:45:38.140]   in the news vertical.
[00:45:38.140 --> 00:45:39.580]   So they're just keeping people up to date.
[00:45:39.580 --> 00:45:41.620]   And what's going on in social media?
[00:45:41.620 --> 00:45:44.540]   I'm curious how successful some of these new verticals have been.
[00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:48.660]   Do we have any sort of metrics to see whether or not this new like news digest that they
[00:45:48.660 --> 00:45:49.660]   have rolled out?
[00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:53.380]   How successful that is Yahoo screen or any of these things they've been rolling out?
[00:45:53.380 --> 00:45:56.780]   I, you know, traditionally Yahoo does very well.
[00:45:56.780 --> 00:46:03.020]   OMG, which nobody knows is a Yahoo property is one of the most viewed sites on the net.
[00:46:03.020 --> 00:46:04.020]   Yahoo sports.
[00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:05.020]   Yahoo finance.
[00:46:05.020 --> 00:46:06.020]   These are huge.
[00:46:06.020 --> 00:46:07.020]   Yeah.
[00:46:07.020 --> 00:46:08.020]   They are.
[00:46:08.020 --> 00:46:09.860]   And yet when I look at tech meme, so tech meme is where I often go to see what the big
[00:46:09.860 --> 00:46:10.860]   headlines are.
[00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:14.100]   I have yet to see Yahoo tech on tech meme.
[00:46:14.100 --> 00:46:16.940]   The Yahoo tech stuff is lame.
[00:46:16.940 --> 00:46:17.940]   Have you looked at it?
[00:46:17.940 --> 00:46:18.940]   There it is.
[00:46:18.940 --> 00:46:22.060]   SLR asks David Pogue.
[00:46:22.060 --> 00:46:27.900]   But then that's a side story explaining more general feature style art.
[00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:32.180]   I think David Pogue who's running this, by the way, and our friend, Ralph Needleman,
[00:46:32.180 --> 00:46:36.180]   who's taken a job as managing editor there, I think that they've said this is going to
[00:46:36.180 --> 00:46:39.540]   be for more more general.
[00:46:39.540 --> 00:46:46.660]   You know, I wouldn't be surprised if they, because Rafe is more of a techie than Pogue
[00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:49.500]   is, post more of a kind of personality.
[00:46:49.500 --> 00:46:53.500]   And I wouldn't be surprised if they tried to do what you just, you know, try to do something
[00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:57.740]   a little more techie and they have the suits come in and say, "You know, this is a little
[00:46:57.740 --> 00:46:58.980]   too techie."
[00:46:58.980 --> 00:47:00.980]   God knows that happened to us plenty of times on TV.
[00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:01.980]   Yeah.
[00:47:01.980 --> 00:47:02.980]   Yeah.
[00:47:02.980 --> 00:47:03.980]   Well, it'd be the same thing.
[00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:04.980]   Same thing.
[00:47:04.980 --> 00:47:05.980]   So you have the suits come in.
[00:47:05.980 --> 00:47:07.980]   They don't do that to the finance guys, but they do it to these guys.
[00:47:07.980 --> 00:47:09.620]   You use a weird word.
[00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:10.620]   You can bend.
[00:47:10.620 --> 00:47:14.300]   If you're doing Yahoo finance, you're urged all the time to be more, I don't know what
[00:47:14.300 --> 00:47:15.620]   the word would be, technical.
[00:47:15.620 --> 00:47:16.620]   Wonky.
[00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:17.620]   I would assume.
[00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:21.540]   Yeah, but this, no, no, they, no, no, no, it's going to read this.
[00:47:21.540 --> 00:47:23.220]   Nobody cares about chips.
[00:47:23.220 --> 00:47:26.540]   The voting is open for the first ever Jiff of the Year award.
[00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:28.180]   See, here's the Jiffy's.
[00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:33.340]   Here's a story straight out of the streets.
[00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:37.260]   The Jiffy's study, walking and texting ruins your posture.
[00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:38.940]   Jiff of the year.
[00:47:38.940 --> 00:47:41.580]   They have a study for Rafe.
[00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:42.580]   The Jiffy's.
[00:47:42.580 --> 00:47:45.700]   The Jiffy's now open through January 28.
[00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:46.700]   So hurry.
[00:47:46.700 --> 00:47:51.100]   Winners will be picked with help from sites like Buzzfeed and Gadget and Mashable.
[00:47:51.100 --> 00:47:54.940]   Aren't you glad you're gone from and Gadget Tim?
[00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:59.900]   Yeah, I know, no comment Leo, but take this size and answer.
[00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:04.660]   But the expectation is definitely for a Fiyahu tech to be more of a consumer facing tech
[00:48:04.660 --> 00:48:05.660]   blogs.
[00:48:05.660 --> 00:48:06.660]   Do you think so?
[00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:07.660]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:48:07.660 --> 00:48:08.660]   It is.
[00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:09.660]   Yeah, that's definitely the way they're going.
[00:48:09.660 --> 00:48:11.860]   And I think that's something that, you know, something that a big property like, yeah,
[00:48:11.860 --> 00:48:14.220]   I would definitely need, you know, that they need something that's going to be providing
[00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:17.780]   tech news with a general consumer angle toward it.
[00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:19.220]   You know, I think that's a little bit too hardcore.
[00:48:19.220 --> 00:48:22.060]   And if that's really successful, then they can, you know, kind of branch out and go a
[00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:24.820]   little bit more, a little bit more hardcore, a little bit more techy, a little bit more
[00:48:24.820 --> 00:48:27.020]   nerdy with, with the news ankle and the news spin.
[00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:30.460]   But for now, yeah, I definitely think they're going to be keeping it at a high level.
[00:48:30.460 --> 00:48:34.540]   I frankly breathe this side of relief because I don't, I don't want them to be techy.
[00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:35.540]   I want them to be.
[00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:37.540]   You think everything's a threat.
[00:48:37.540 --> 00:48:39.620]   Well, you know, you're a paranoid character.
[00:48:39.620 --> 00:48:43.380]   I don't think any of the paranoid survive as, what's his name said?
[00:48:43.380 --> 00:48:46.220]   There's a lot of nice guys out there that do just fine for themselves.
[00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:47.540]   I would put myself in that category.
[00:48:47.540 --> 00:48:48.540]   Very nice guy.
[00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:49.540]   Yeah.
[00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:50.540]   Yeah.
[00:48:50.540 --> 00:48:53.860]   My motto is if you have something nice to say, come sit next to me.
[00:48:53.860 --> 00:48:55.340]   Don't say anything at all.
[00:48:55.340 --> 00:48:59.060]   This is the Jiffy site T H E G I F Y S dot com.
[00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:01.540]   I don't think you'd ever guess that spelling, by the way.
[00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:04.300]   No, no, I would have, I would have put either two F's.
[00:49:04.300 --> 00:49:05.300]   I think two F's.
[00:49:05.300 --> 00:49:06.300]   Yeah.
[00:49:06.300 --> 00:49:10.660]   There's another one study looking at your smartphone at night can make you more tired
[00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:11.660]   the next day.
[00:49:11.660 --> 00:49:12.660]   Is that true?
[00:49:12.660 --> 00:49:13.660]   Is that on the page?
[00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:18.460]   Is that on the right of the cat jumping into the beat?
[00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:20.060]   Is that on the Yahoo page?
[00:49:20.060 --> 00:49:22.660]   We're going to just sit here and slam the Yahoo page.
[00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:25.100]   I had a caller on the radio show.
[00:49:25.100 --> 00:49:26.100]   I loved her.
[00:49:26.100 --> 00:49:31.500]   Diane from Chicago was talking about, she just bought a Galaxy Note 3.
[00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:34.500]   You know, the big, she says it's 5.7 inches.
[00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:35.500]   I said, do you like it?
[00:49:35.500 --> 00:49:39.740]   I said, no, I love it like a man.
[00:49:39.740 --> 00:49:42.860]   And I what color was it?
[00:49:42.860 --> 00:49:46.020]   Gee, I said, you, I go to bed with mine too.
[00:49:46.020 --> 00:49:47.740]   I understand how you feel.
[00:49:47.740 --> 00:49:48.740]   Gosh.
[00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:50.740]   I brought that.
[00:49:50.740 --> 00:49:53.700]   Yeah, that's a pretty odd thing to bring up out of the blue.
[00:49:53.700 --> 00:49:55.820]   I can't believe this is in there.
[00:49:55.820 --> 00:49:57.860]   Looking at your smartphone at night could make you.
[00:49:57.860 --> 00:49:58.860]   I'm Brian heater.
[00:49:58.860 --> 00:49:59.860]   No, what are you looking at?
[00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:03.780]   I click on this story because, okay, yes, the headline is obvious.
[00:50:03.780 --> 00:50:10.180]   This bean bag on a stick will change the way you think about robotic hands.
[00:50:10.180 --> 00:50:13.700]   Is that, come on, talk to Brian and tell him, no.
[00:50:13.700 --> 00:50:14.700]   Apple report.
[00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:16.700]   And then there's a hardcore story.
[00:50:16.700 --> 00:50:21.580]   We all know, you know, that the writer of the story very often does not like the headline.
[00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:22.580]   Exactly.
[00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:24.140]   They've got something to bring out.
[00:50:24.140 --> 00:50:25.140]   That's always a 2007.
[00:50:25.140 --> 00:50:29.340]   There's a Murph on and gadget wrote a story about gadgets affecting lack of sleep.
[00:50:29.340 --> 00:50:32.500]   So I do want to say that, you know, this is the sort of study that gets picked up elsewhere,
[00:50:32.500 --> 00:50:35.980]   but definitely the headlines here are a bit different to perhaps.
[00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:39.620]   That's usually written by the some middling editor.
[00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:44.540]   The headline headlines in newspapers, you had a the guy that was like that was his job.
[00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:47.180]   That was that only in Murdoch papers.
[00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:48.180]   Believe me.
[00:50:48.180 --> 00:50:49.180]   Okay.
[00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:50.540]   So real newspapers, a copy editor would do it.
[00:50:50.540 --> 00:50:53.620]   Yeah, or one of the editors, a line editor, somebody would do it.
[00:50:53.620 --> 00:50:54.980]   There'd be somebody assigned to it.
[00:50:54.980 --> 00:50:56.460]   They're sometimes the editor would do it.
[00:50:56.460 --> 00:50:57.460]   The New York Post.
[00:50:57.460 --> 00:51:00.660]   The New York Post should like they were there.
[00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:03.340]   There was a rumor that they used to actually pay.
[00:51:03.340 --> 00:51:07.460]   They would do there was a great headline like headless bar, headless body found in top
[00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:12.300]   of this bar that guy would come out and drop a 200 bucks right in the guy's left.
[00:51:12.300 --> 00:51:14.100]   That's the greatest headline I ever said.
[00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:15.100]   That's the best headline ever.
[00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:16.100]   But it was a tabloid paper.
[00:51:16.100 --> 00:51:17.100]   You bought it on the way to the subway.
[00:51:17.100 --> 00:51:21.500]   There's still a newspapers on the stand and you're going to buy the one that has the best,
[00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:22.500]   you know, manner.
[00:51:22.500 --> 00:51:23.500]   Yeah.
[00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:24.500]   If you go, I always like to study.
[00:51:24.500 --> 00:51:30.420]   If you go to England, go because because then in the magazine business in England, tends
[00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:35.380]   to be oriented toward newsstand sales as opposed to subscriptions like it is here.
[00:51:35.380 --> 00:51:40.700]   So you go to the newsstand and you just back up and see what magazines are the most compelling
[00:51:40.700 --> 00:51:45.260]   and some of the great headline writers are in England writing these crazy headlines and
[00:51:45.260 --> 00:51:48.620]   you just gravitate towards certain things and you look at, wow.
[00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:52.180]   The British have a penchant for using the word clever.
[00:51:52.180 --> 00:51:57.980]   Even the, you know, the big billboard ads in the underground, they're always clever.
[00:51:57.980 --> 00:51:59.420]   Those grab you, right?
[00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:00.420]   Well, that's what you want.
[00:52:00.420 --> 00:52:01.980]   Puns or whatever.
[00:52:01.980 --> 00:52:03.900]   Our show today brought to you by stamps.com.
[00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:05.460]   I'll tell you what's going to grab you.
[00:52:05.460 --> 00:52:07.660]   There's a new, the postage rates are going up.
[00:52:07.660 --> 00:52:08.660]   I can't believe this.
[00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:09.660]   Didn't they just raise it?
[00:52:09.660 --> 00:52:10.660]   49 cents.
[00:52:10.660 --> 00:52:11.660]   Yes.
[00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:12.660]   One up today.
[00:52:12.660 --> 00:52:16.020]   So if you have a postage meter, I, you know, tomorrow we'll see a bunch of people with
[00:52:16.020 --> 00:52:19.860]   postage meters in line at the post office getting them upgraded or you have to pay Pitney
[00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:22.220]   Bose to get not with stamps.com.
[00:52:22.220 --> 00:52:23.220]   It's always up to date.
[00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:26.740]   You always have exactly the right postage you need, the instant you need it and you don't
[00:52:26.740 --> 00:52:28.140]   have to get up from your desk.
[00:52:28.140 --> 00:52:31.460]   You're using your computer, your printer.
[00:52:31.460 --> 00:52:32.700]   That's why I love stamps.com.
[00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:36.340]   And you, you really appreciate it on those days when the post office is just jammed with
[00:52:36.340 --> 00:52:40.020]   people doing things like that, getting new stamps.
[00:52:40.020 --> 00:52:44.860]   And unlike those postage meter companies, stamps.com never charges a fee to update postage rates.
[00:52:44.860 --> 00:52:47.980]   You always get the exact postage you need for any letter, any package.
[00:52:47.980 --> 00:52:50.300]   You've got that great USB scale.
[00:52:50.300 --> 00:52:52.140]   You plop the letter or package on the scale.
[00:52:52.140 --> 00:52:53.460]   It prints out the label for you.
[00:52:53.460 --> 00:52:54.660]   It'll print right on the envelope.
[00:52:54.660 --> 00:52:58.900]   In fact, they'll take the address from your QuickBooks or your address book from if you're
[00:52:58.900 --> 00:53:03.740]   an eBay or PayPal seller or Amazon or any one of those.
[00:53:03.740 --> 00:53:06.740]   Etsy, it'll automatically take the data from the website.
[00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:09.540]   If it's an international order, it'll fill out the international forms.
[00:53:09.540 --> 00:53:11.300]   It'll put your return address on there.
[00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:13.860]   It'll even put your company logo if you want.
[00:53:13.860 --> 00:53:14.860]   Stamps.com.
[00:53:14.860 --> 00:53:18.820]   It makes you look like a soft, like a fulfillment professional.
[00:53:18.820 --> 00:53:22.780]   They were, you know, just named it Software Magazine's annual 500 list.
[00:53:22.780 --> 00:53:27.540]   One of the great software companies in the country for 2013.
[00:53:27.540 --> 00:53:28.740]   So I got a special offer.
[00:53:28.740 --> 00:53:33.740]   Visit Stamps.com, read up, then go to the home page and click the microphone in the upper
[00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:36.180]   right hand corner.
[00:53:36.180 --> 00:53:40.300]   And when it asks you for an offer code type in "Twit," you saw that $80 bonus value.
[00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:42.780]   You know we're going to turn that into a $110 bonus offer.
[00:53:42.780 --> 00:53:47.500]   It includes a digital scale and $55 of free postage you can use in the first few months

[00:53:54.900 --> 00:53:55.900]   Type in "Twit."

[00:54:01.060 --> 00:54:04.580]   I still have some Leo stamps I got at Stamps.com, but they're 37 cents.
[00:54:04.580 --> 00:54:06.260]   That should tell you that I got them a long time ago.
[00:54:06.260 --> 00:54:08.020]   Well, just put another stamp on there.
[00:54:08.020 --> 00:54:09.020]   Yeah.
[00:54:09.020 --> 00:54:10.220]   I like the forever stamps.
[00:54:10.220 --> 00:54:11.500]   That seems like a good deal.
[00:54:11.500 --> 00:54:14.580]   Could you make money if you like you bought forever stamps now and you saved them for 20,
[00:54:14.580 --> 00:54:15.580]   30 years?
[00:54:15.580 --> 00:54:16.580]   That's exactly what I was thinking.
[00:54:16.580 --> 00:54:17.580]   It's pretty good investment these days.
[00:54:17.580 --> 00:54:18.580]   Yeah.
[00:54:18.580 --> 00:54:19.580]   It's, that's called arbitrage, isn't it?
[00:54:19.580 --> 00:54:21.820]   Isn't that what the technical term?
[00:54:21.820 --> 00:54:23.860]   They would pull the plug on it.
[00:54:23.860 --> 00:54:24.860]   You get screwed somehow.
[00:54:24.860 --> 00:54:26.380]   Sort of forever.
[00:54:26.380 --> 00:54:31.900]   So if you're a big name guy in Silicon Valley or in the tech scene, if you're like somebody
[00:54:31.900 --> 00:54:36.860]   who started Twitter like Biz Stone, people pay attention to what your next act is, right?
[00:54:36.860 --> 00:54:41.580]   Biz Stone's next act, and I haven't even played with it, is called Jelly.
[00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:44.940]   It's a, has anybody used Jelly?
[00:54:44.940 --> 00:54:48.140]   It's a Q&A service that you can install.
[00:54:48.140 --> 00:54:49.660]   I should install it on my phone.
[00:54:49.660 --> 00:54:50.660]   What is it?
[00:54:50.660 --> 00:54:52.660]   Yeah, it's called Twitter.
[00:54:52.660 --> 00:54:54.660]   Well, I think-
[00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:54.660]   You think-
[00:54:54.660 --> 00:54:56.060]   I think a picture of something and people respond.
[00:54:56.060 --> 00:54:57.060]   I mean, I-
[00:54:57.060 --> 00:54:59.060]   It's kind of Twitter-like.
[00:54:59.060 --> 00:55:01.100]   Yeah.
[00:55:01.100 --> 00:55:06.460]   The idea is, yeah, you take a picture of something and you say, what is this?
[00:55:06.460 --> 00:55:07.460]   What's this flower?
[00:55:07.460 --> 00:55:08.460]   Oh.
[00:55:08.460 --> 00:55:11.820]   And you post it on your jelly and then people are supposed to answer.
[00:55:11.820 --> 00:55:13.220]   Oh, cool.
[00:55:13.220 --> 00:55:17.340]   In addition to working worse, yeah, you could forward increase to friends outside the app
[00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:22.860]   if they don't have it, which is probably likely since I don't think anybody's downloaded
[00:55:22.860 --> 00:55:23.860]   this.
[00:55:23.860 --> 00:55:24.860]   I asked people-
[00:55:24.860 --> 00:55:27.140]   There were a couple of apps that popped up like this couple, yeah, in the past like
[00:55:27.140 --> 00:55:31.220]   two years that were very much like Jelly that got, you know, they were trying to answer
[00:55:31.220 --> 00:55:36.380]   questions for you and you would post questions on it and people respond and you sort of picked
[00:55:36.380 --> 00:55:37.380]   their brain about it.
[00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:40.220]   And I never knew anyone that would use it.
[00:55:40.220 --> 00:55:42.300]   And by the way, they don't own jelly.com.
[00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:44.460]   Fisher and Vicer does.
[00:55:44.460 --> 00:55:45.460]   They make-
[00:55:45.460 --> 00:55:46.460]   Jelly.
[00:55:46.460 --> 00:55:47.460]   Jelly.
[00:55:47.460 --> 00:55:49.380]   You think Smuckers would own Jelly?
[00:55:49.380 --> 00:55:50.380]   You think?
[00:55:50.380 --> 00:55:51.380]   My Smuckers is a little slow to-
[00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:52.380]   The name like Smuckers?
[00:55:52.380 --> 00:55:54.460]   Yeah, whoever heard of Fisher and Wicer.
[00:55:54.460 --> 00:55:57.740]   Well, apparently now a lot of people, they make mustard sauce.
[00:55:57.740 --> 00:55:58.740]   They make all kinds of stuff.
[00:55:58.740 --> 00:55:59.740]   Looks very good.
[00:55:59.740 --> 00:56:00.740]   It's good, Jelly.
[00:56:00.740 --> 00:56:01.740]   Non-GMO.
[00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:08.700]   So, I guess it's just not enough to be Biz Stone and say, "Hey, I'll give it my seal of
[00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:09.700]   approval.
[00:56:09.700 --> 00:56:11.020]   Everybody download this app."
[00:56:11.020 --> 00:56:12.020]   Maybe it's huge.
[00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:13.260]   I just- I don't see anybody using it.
[00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:14.460]   Well, I would use it.
[00:56:14.460 --> 00:56:16.100]   I didn't know about it.
[00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:17.100]   Maybe they need to-
[00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:21.140]   So you point, shoot and ask, you answer with a drawing and text.
[00:56:21.140 --> 00:56:25.500]   Use your existing social networks so you don't have to assume.
[00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:29.100]   You can even forward the question to somebody via text message.
[00:56:29.100 --> 00:56:32.580]   "Hey, I asked a question on an obscure application you don't have.
[00:56:32.580 --> 00:56:35.580]   Would you please download and install the application so that you can answer it?"
[00:56:35.580 --> 00:56:36.980]   That kind of thing.
[00:56:36.980 --> 00:56:39.180]   Or, "I've got some code here.
[00:56:39.180 --> 00:56:40.180]   Where's the bug?"
[00:56:40.180 --> 00:56:42.300]   You know what it is?
[00:56:42.300 --> 00:56:43.620]   It's Quora, isn't it?
[00:56:43.620 --> 00:56:46.660]   Quora was such an instant hit.
[00:56:46.660 --> 00:56:47.460]   But are they still-
[00:56:47.460 --> 00:56:52.900]   Quora was sketchy because all their hits were coming from the Philippines or something like
[00:56:52.900 --> 00:56:53.900]   that.
[00:56:53.900 --> 00:56:55.460]   Oh, you think they were farming out the hits?
[00:56:55.460 --> 00:57:01.620]   Well, you know, there's a lot of companies do that.
[00:57:01.620 --> 00:57:06.340]   In the tell, we talked quite a bit about Intel's television effort.
[00:57:06.340 --> 00:57:08.260]   They were going to do, I don't know what-
[00:57:08.260 --> 00:57:11.220]   I don't know what the point of it was to begin with, but everyone thinks it's great
[00:57:11.220 --> 00:57:12.220]   that they sold it.
[00:57:12.220 --> 00:57:15.740]   It was a big hit.
[00:57:15.740 --> 00:57:21.980]   The service was called OnQ, C-U-E, and Verizon bought it.
[00:57:21.980 --> 00:57:27.180]   They're buying the Intel media assets, the OnQ TV service.
[00:57:27.180 --> 00:57:30.700]   Why would Intel even create something like this?
[00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:32.460]   Oh, they make processors.
[00:57:32.460 --> 00:57:34.380]   It's a mystery.
[00:57:34.380 --> 00:57:41.420]   At the center of the joint venture was Comcast, the cable company, with, according to this
[00:57:41.420 --> 00:57:47.900]   article in Gigo, and the largest R&D team in the industry, Comcast, Verizon developed
[00:57:47.900 --> 00:57:53.060]   something called Nuon that was supposed to give customers an alternative to online video
[00:57:53.060 --> 00:57:56.780]   offerings by tying broadband, pay TV, and mobile together.
[00:57:56.780 --> 00:57:59.100]   Oh, this was like a grand scheme.
[00:57:59.100 --> 00:58:01.100]   What was that?
[00:58:01.100 --> 00:58:02.100]   Huawei?
[00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:05.740]   This was the box, the actual hardware that would compete with Apple TV or-
[00:58:05.740 --> 00:58:10.420]   Well, because they came out with the NUC, which is a little box that I like a lot.
[00:58:10.420 --> 00:58:11.420]   Yeah.
[00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:14.580]   Since then, and that's supposed to be the same, you're supposed to do all this TV stuff,
[00:58:14.580 --> 00:58:17.340]   but you're supposed to figure it all out for yourself.
[00:58:17.340 --> 00:58:22.260]   So Verizon pulled out of that in last August, and that killed Nuon, but now they've got
[00:58:22.260 --> 00:58:24.300]   OnQ, I don't know.
[00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:29.020]   This is these guys trying to figure out what the hell's going on.
[00:58:29.020 --> 00:58:31.900]   Nobody seems to know.
[00:58:31.900 --> 00:58:33.060]   There's no news this week.
[00:58:33.060 --> 00:58:34.060]   Yeah, there is.
[00:58:34.060 --> 00:58:35.060]   There's plenty of news.
[00:58:35.060 --> 00:58:36.060]   What happened this week?
[00:58:36.060 --> 00:58:37.060]   The FCC of the case.
[00:58:37.060 --> 00:58:38.060]   That's last week.
[00:58:38.060 --> 00:58:40.220]   Well, not to me.
[00:58:40.220 --> 00:58:41.300]   John just got here.
[00:58:41.300 --> 00:58:46.100]   So if anybody would like to explain the FCC ruling, we actually had Denise Howell on
[00:58:46.100 --> 00:58:47.100]   last week.
[00:58:47.100 --> 00:58:48.100]   We talked about it, what it meant.
[00:58:48.100 --> 00:58:49.100]   What does it mean?
[00:58:49.100 --> 00:58:50.100]   It means nothing.
[00:58:50.100 --> 00:58:51.100]   Yeah.
[00:58:51.100 --> 00:58:52.340]   Okay, sure.
[00:58:52.340 --> 00:58:53.540]   It means something to me.
[00:58:53.540 --> 00:58:56.740]   It means this is another step in the direction that this whole industry is headed, which
[00:58:56.740 --> 00:59:01.340]   is licensing people like you and everybody who's on the Internet.
[00:59:01.340 --> 00:59:03.060]   No, it's terrible for people like me.
[00:59:03.060 --> 00:59:04.060]   Yeah.
[00:59:04.060 --> 00:59:05.620]   And Clayton, you're totally doomed.
[00:59:05.620 --> 00:59:06.620]   People who do podcasts.
[00:59:06.620 --> 00:59:08.860]   And Clayton, he makes all his money from Fox.
[00:59:08.860 --> 00:59:10.860]   We're dead.
[00:59:10.860 --> 00:59:12.100]   How exactly are we dead?
[00:59:12.100 --> 00:59:14.500]   I mean, is Twitter going to fold up?
[00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:15.500]   No, we're not dead.
[00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:16.500]   That's why I even said this.
[00:59:16.500 --> 00:59:21.060]   This doesn't really impact us, but it might slow down new people who say, "I want to build
[00:59:21.060 --> 00:59:22.060]   a business."
[00:59:22.060 --> 00:59:23.060]   Ah, that's a good thing.
[00:59:23.060 --> 00:59:24.060]   I want to...
[00:59:24.060 --> 00:59:25.660]   I'm pulling up the ladder.
[00:59:25.660 --> 00:59:33.700]   The help of the FCC, the whole issue is, of course, net neutrality and the idea that somebody,
[00:59:33.700 --> 00:59:38.700]   like for instance, AT&T's sponsored stories program, somebody would come along and say
[00:59:38.700 --> 00:59:43.740]   to AT&T, "Yeah, I want to underwrite any bandwidth that people use to get to my website."
[00:59:43.740 --> 00:59:46.260]   AT&T tells the customer, "Look, good news.
[00:59:46.260 --> 00:59:50.140]   It's not going to come across you to go visit Netflix, let's say."
[00:59:50.140 --> 00:59:54.140]   Which brings us to native advertising, which is all over these...
[00:59:54.140 --> 00:59:55.140]   What's that?
[00:59:55.140 --> 00:59:56.140]   What's that?
[00:59:56.140 --> 00:59:59.060]   It's a big advertising, which is a big deal right now.
[00:59:59.060 --> 01:00:02.020]   You see, I'm a mashable as a big native advertising operation.
[01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:03.020]   Buzzfeed.
[01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:04.020]   Buzzfeed.
[01:00:04.020 --> 01:00:05.020]   New York Times.
[01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:06.020]   What is it?
[01:00:06.020 --> 01:00:07.340]   CNN, you can look it up.
[01:00:07.340 --> 01:00:14.500]   It's like articles that appear as if they are content paid for.
[01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:15.500]   But it's not.
[01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:17.420]   With actual pieces of content.
[01:00:17.420 --> 01:00:18.420]   Right?
[01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:19.900]   And they've dropped this.
[01:00:19.900 --> 01:00:23.940]   They have the contributing editor title or something like that.
[01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:24.940]   They have a contributor title.
[01:00:24.940 --> 01:00:25.940]   Yeah.
[01:00:25.940 --> 01:00:26.940]   And then what you realize after you've read this...
[01:00:26.940 --> 01:00:27.940]   Add.
[01:00:27.940 --> 01:00:28.940]   Not even an ad.
[01:00:28.940 --> 01:00:31.780]   It's like an opinion piece that favors this guy's company.
[01:00:31.780 --> 01:00:34.220]   Yeah, it's an ad.
[01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:35.220]   And this is a big deal.
[01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:36.220]   Everyone's using it.
[01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:37.220]   And there's now there's a company out there.
[01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:39.140]   Can I say we will never do this?
[01:00:39.140 --> 01:00:40.980]   You can say it, but it doesn't mean anything.
[01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:41.980]   We will never do this.
[01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:43.780]   Well, we'll see.
[01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:45.780]   There's a lot of money involved.
[01:00:45.780 --> 01:00:46.780]   Is there a lot?
[01:00:46.780 --> 01:00:47.780]   What kind of do you say there was money involved?
[01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:48.780]   You said there was money involved.
[01:00:48.780 --> 01:00:49.780]   You tell me there was money involved.
[01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:50.780]   Naturally, yeah.
[01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:51.780]   There's money.
[01:00:51.780 --> 01:00:52.780]   What do you mean I do a lot of it next time?
[01:00:52.780 --> 01:00:55.620]   I did a natural form of native advertising.
[01:00:55.620 --> 01:01:01.500]   Because I bring Clayton, gluten free Clayton Morris on and he didn't pay you a nickel.
[01:01:01.500 --> 01:01:02.500]   Not a dime.
[01:01:02.500 --> 01:01:03.500]   But whoever is...
[01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:04.500]   In fact, he didn't even make a nickel.
[01:01:04.500 --> 01:01:05.500]   He gave it away.
[01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:06.500]   This is an old time.
[01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:07.500]   And you'll be 30 pounds lighter.
[01:01:07.500 --> 01:01:08.500]   Two things.
[01:01:08.500 --> 01:01:11.100]   I am so excited about this.
[01:01:11.100 --> 01:01:12.620]   So anyway, back to native avatars.
[01:01:12.620 --> 01:01:17.580]   Now there's actually a mechanism that you can join where you give the native ad to this
[01:01:17.580 --> 01:01:20.780]   distribution like a double click and they drop it in a whole bunch of news.
[01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:21.780]   They were all over the place.
[01:01:21.780 --> 01:01:25.100]   Exactly what Matt Cutz was talking about when he said don't do this anymore.
[01:01:25.100 --> 01:01:26.100]   Well, kind of.
[01:01:26.100 --> 01:01:28.100]   What's he gonna do about it?
[01:01:28.100 --> 01:01:30.780]   He runs Google's spam operation.
[01:01:30.780 --> 01:01:31.780]   He can delist you.
[01:01:31.780 --> 01:01:32.780]   Look what happened to this.
[01:01:32.780 --> 01:01:36.020]   I like to see him delist the New York Times.
[01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:37.020]   Well that's the thing.
[01:01:37.020 --> 01:01:38.060]   That's a big company that's doing this.
[01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:41.900]   So his Matt Cutz argument for SEO and backlinking.
[01:01:41.900 --> 01:01:46.220]   For years, the strategy had been if you wanted to build up your blog status within Google
[01:01:46.220 --> 01:01:51.620]   search rank, a page rank that you would of course write guest blog posts on other people
[01:01:51.620 --> 01:01:55.460]   you would try to get high profile blogs to allow you to come in and do a guest post
[01:01:55.460 --> 01:02:00.540]   that say you want to write about life hacking and you contact Tim Ferriss to write something
[01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:06.540]   or you maybe you reach out to Pat Flynn and you try to write something on his smart passive
[01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:08.060]   income blog or something like that.
[01:02:08.060 --> 01:02:09.500]   You try to make these connections.
[01:02:09.500 --> 01:02:13.700]   Well, now Matt Cutz is saying, hey, now that these companies are coming in and offering
[01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:18.340]   to pay for these things to happen, we're cutting it off.
[01:02:18.340 --> 01:02:23.180]   And this year, Mark, my words is the year that that backlinking strategy and guest blogging
[01:02:23.180 --> 01:02:24.180]   is done.
[01:02:24.180 --> 01:02:25.180]   Is that different?
[01:02:25.180 --> 01:02:26.340]   Yeah, but that's different.
[01:02:26.340 --> 01:02:28.140]   Yeah, that's different.
[01:02:28.140 --> 01:02:29.780]   I don't know how.
[01:02:29.780 --> 01:02:35.660]   Well, it's, well, it's, we'll go on because it's, well, first of all, it's more transparent
[01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:38.940]   because you're at least seeing a sponsor, right on the, right?
[01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:41.180]   The advertising is clear that it's an act.
[01:02:41.180 --> 01:02:42.820]   No, that is not true.
[01:02:42.820 --> 01:02:44.140]   I can find a zap left.
[01:02:44.140 --> 01:02:48.300]   If you go to Buzzfeed, for instance, go to Mashable.
[01:02:48.300 --> 01:02:49.740]   Yeah, we're Mashable.
[01:02:49.740 --> 01:02:56.300]   And you look at, so this, or if you're on Buzzfeed, you see this watch 16 seconds of
[01:02:56.300 --> 01:02:58.700]   Nick Mangold's glorious hair.
[01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:00.660]   You see the featured partner.
[01:03:00.660 --> 01:03:01.660]   Yes.
[01:03:01.660 --> 01:03:02.660]   Same thing.
[01:03:02.660 --> 01:03:06.500]   Twelve easy steps to throw a Grammy viewing partner presented by Pepsi.
[01:03:06.500 --> 01:03:07.500]   Right.
[01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:09.780]   Delve, Belvida breakfast biscuits.
[01:03:09.780 --> 01:03:12.460]   Ten reasons why morning people always win.
[01:03:12.460 --> 01:03:15.660]   So these are, but they're, they're kind of called out as ads.
[01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:17.500]   It says, it's in a orange, yellow box.
[01:03:17.500 --> 01:03:18.500]   It says featured partner.
[01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:22.580]   Not always featured partner.
[01:03:22.580 --> 01:03:23.580]   What do you think that means?
[01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:24.580]   How to write an old school.
[01:03:24.580 --> 01:03:25.580]   Oh, it's a featured partner.
[01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:26.580]   Let me look at it.
[01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:29.460]   Booty jam by Carl's Jr.
[01:03:29.460 --> 01:03:34.620]   So this tells me that these sites are struggling, or is it the degree?
[01:03:34.620 --> 01:03:36.780]   A book, a half and a half, I'd say.
[01:03:36.780 --> 01:03:42.540]   Because if you start to resort, I mean, I think everybody knows this is not good for
[01:03:42.540 --> 01:03:43.540]   business.
[01:03:43.540 --> 01:03:44.540]   Business.
[01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:45.540]   It's not good for the site.
[01:03:45.540 --> 01:03:46.540]   It's not good for editorial integrity.
[01:03:46.540 --> 01:03:51.340]   But you do it if you have to, if it's how you keep the lights on.
[01:03:51.340 --> 01:03:52.340]   Yeah.
[01:03:52.340 --> 01:03:55.900]   One of the ways that a lot of these companies are making up for lost ad revenue either because
[01:03:55.900 --> 01:04:01.100]   of mobile viewership, which of course is lower CPMs and fewer opportunities for placing ads.
[01:04:01.100 --> 01:04:05.860]   But yeah, in general, it's just a way of making more money either making up for those losses
[01:04:05.860 --> 01:04:08.620]   or just being greedy in general.
[01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:10.500]   Well, it's not even the greedy thing.
[01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:13.700]   The advertisers themselves, you know, they want it.
[01:04:13.700 --> 01:04:14.700]   I understand they want it.
[01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:15.700]   Absolutely.
[01:04:15.700 --> 01:04:19.740]   Once the New York Times and CNN got on board with this stuff, the advertisers looked at
[01:04:19.740 --> 01:04:23.280]   the results they get from this and it's much, but they say something like, well, let me
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:26.180]   read a 10 times better response rates.
[01:04:26.180 --> 01:04:27.660]   They are now insisting on these ads.
[01:04:27.660 --> 01:04:29.460]   Yes, because they're tricking readers.
[01:04:29.460 --> 01:04:30.460]   Yes.
[01:04:30.460 --> 01:04:31.860]   I'm looking at the New York Times.
[01:04:31.860 --> 01:04:32.860]   Where is it?
[01:04:32.860 --> 01:04:33.860]   Where is it?
[01:04:33.860 --> 01:04:37.300]   No, it's the New York Times calls it out, but it's usually deeper in the, it's not on
[01:04:37.300 --> 01:04:38.300]   the, I've never seen one.
[01:04:38.300 --> 01:04:39.300]   It's not on the front page.
[01:04:39.300 --> 01:04:41.140]   At least not that I've ever seen.
[01:04:41.140 --> 01:04:42.740]   And well, fashion and style.
[01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:44.500]   It'll be on fashion and style, right?
[01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:45.500]   Probably.
[01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:46.820]   That's a good guess.
[01:04:46.820 --> 01:04:47.820]   Yeah.
[01:04:47.820 --> 01:04:49.820]   Let's go to fashion and style.
[01:04:49.820 --> 01:04:52.940]   So it would, it would say written by or?
[01:04:52.940 --> 01:04:55.900]   Yeah, written by CEO of some company.
[01:04:55.900 --> 01:04:57.380]   Yeah.
[01:04:57.380 --> 01:04:58.380]   It seems to me.
[01:04:58.380 --> 01:05:00.100]   I see that on business week, right?
[01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:02.220]   You're seeing CEO of some company.
[01:05:02.220 --> 01:05:09.700]   It seems to me that this is a sign that these, that there's not, I think you're right, Tim.
[01:05:09.700 --> 01:05:11.020]   I think, I don't think it's greed.
[01:05:11.020 --> 01:05:12.540]   I think it's desperation.
[01:05:12.540 --> 01:05:13.540]   Desperation.
[01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:15.460]   And that's a little worrying, isn't it?
[01:05:15.460 --> 01:05:21.380]   There was a huge uproar when the Atlantic ran an editorial from the Miscavige of Scientology.
[01:05:21.380 --> 01:05:22.380]   Yeah.
[01:05:22.380 --> 01:05:24.140]   And that's basically exactly what was going on here.
[01:05:24.140 --> 01:05:27.940]   That was, you can think of that as being basically a guest blog about Scientology.
[01:05:27.940 --> 01:05:31.820]   And that was, of course, very poorly labeled as being an ad.
[01:05:31.820 --> 01:05:35.980]   And it was very ugly and had a huge negative impact on that, you know, that absolute publication
[01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:39.060]   that's gone back for so long, that's when people respect.
[01:05:39.060 --> 01:05:40.780]   And they definitely crossed that line there.
[01:05:40.780 --> 01:05:43.060]   And there are so many other companies now that are like, oh, well, if the Atlantic's
[01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:46.020]   doing it, then I guess it's okay that we can do it as well.
[01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:48.460]   And to me, it's definitely sad to see.
[01:05:48.460 --> 01:05:49.460]   I think you're right.
[01:05:49.460 --> 01:05:50.460]   I think it hurt their brand.
[01:05:50.460 --> 01:05:52.140]   And that is a storied brand.
[01:05:52.140 --> 01:05:53.140]   Yeah.
[01:05:53.140 --> 01:05:59.420]   It's sad, but then you see the rise of paid journalism like what Jessica Lesson is doing.
[01:05:59.420 --> 01:06:00.820]   So I don't know.
[01:06:00.820 --> 01:06:07.700]   I think the market affords these types of things and it, people kind of can pay with their
[01:06:07.700 --> 01:06:08.700]   dollars.
[01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:11.660]   They can decide if they want this, if they want this kind of a thing, they're going to
[01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:15.580]   pay for Jessica Lesson's type of journalism with her team.
[01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:18.300]   Or you're going to settle for the kind of stuff that you're seeing with Tim, which is
[01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:20.140]   referring to on the Atlantic.
[01:06:20.140 --> 01:06:23.740]   And I think that's exactly what Matt cuts is getting to as it relates to even just bloggers,
[01:06:23.740 --> 01:06:28.940]   not even just like large scale Mashable and BuzzFeed, which is, you know, if we want to
[01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:33.780]   make the internet maybe a better place for content so that it's that these blogs, maybe
[01:06:33.780 --> 01:06:39.060]   you've come to love and respect, are actually putting out quality content that are great
[01:06:39.060 --> 01:06:40.060]   pieces.
[01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:44.580]   Instead of Pat Flynn writes a really great piece on content strategy, that's great.
[01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:46.180]   And that brings real value to the internet.
[01:06:46.180 --> 01:06:50.860]   But if someone's paying for that and then sticking in the content somewhere as a guest
[01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:55.740]   blog post just to get back links to their website, then we all suffer from it.
[01:06:55.740 --> 01:06:59.140]   Well, the reason these things work, whether it's acknowledged or not, is because they're
[01:06:59.140 --> 01:07:03.780]   essentially fooling people that people read it thinking it's editorial, give it greater
[01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:05.300]   weight than they would.
[01:07:05.300 --> 01:07:06.300]   Right.
[01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:08.300]   That's actually exactly what the problem is.
[01:07:08.300 --> 01:07:09.300]   It's about tricking people.
[01:07:09.300 --> 01:07:10.300]   Yeah.
[01:07:10.300 --> 01:07:14.140]   And I think when any brand starts doing that, they really cheapen the brand.
[01:07:14.140 --> 01:07:19.300]   Now I agree with you Clayton, the market will end up, I hope this will end up shaking out.
[01:07:19.300 --> 01:07:23.100]   And you do see some really interesting moves towards paywalls with Jessica Lesson.
[01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:26.580]   It's $400 to get the information a year I paid for it.
[01:07:26.580 --> 01:07:27.580]   I'm not sure.
[01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:30.740]   I love Jessica's stuff at the Wall Street Journal.
[01:07:30.740 --> 01:07:34.300]   I think it's an interesting move for her and I'll watch with interest to see how she does.
[01:07:34.300 --> 01:07:38.060]   But I'm not sure if the content is so compelling that it's worth $400 a month.
[01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:39.900]   But maybe that's because I'm not an investor.
[01:07:39.900 --> 01:07:45.780]   You look at Recode, which is Cara Swisher and Walt Mossberg's recasting of all things D
[01:07:45.780 --> 01:07:48.100]   under their own brand.
[01:07:48.100 --> 01:07:53.740]   You look at what Dad Greenwald is doing, the guy who broke the stone stuff.
[01:07:53.740 --> 01:07:57.020]   Pierre Almidar is giving him, I don't know how many millions of dollars.
[01:07:57.020 --> 01:07:58.020]   $250 supposedly.
[01:07:58.020 --> 01:08:05.140]   The same amount Jeff Bezos paid for the Washington Post, $250 million to create, I don't know
[01:08:05.140 --> 01:08:06.140]   if it's a paywall?
[01:08:06.140 --> 01:08:07.140]   Is it ad supported?
[01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:08.140]   We don't know yet.
[01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:09.620]   This stuff doesn't bode well for ad supported.
[01:08:09.620 --> 01:08:11.260]   We don't know.
[01:08:11.260 --> 01:08:12.260]   Andrew Sullivan?
[01:08:12.260 --> 01:08:14.100]   Andrew Sullivan was the first.
[01:08:14.100 --> 01:08:15.100]   It was the first.
[01:08:15.100 --> 01:08:17.300]   He says he's making $800,000 in euros.
[01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:18.820]   There are numbers or six.
[01:08:18.820 --> 01:08:20.300]   But it's still good money.
[01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:21.300]   600,000.
[01:08:21.300 --> 01:08:23.500]   Like a team of four people working for him now too.
[01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:24.500]   He's got to pay them.
[01:08:24.500 --> 01:08:25.500]   $600,000.
[01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:29.300]   If you've got five people to support is not much money.
[01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:31.060]   Maybe I forget the number.
[01:08:31.060 --> 01:08:32.060]   Maybe it was three.
[01:08:32.060 --> 01:08:33.220]   I don't call me on that.
[01:08:33.220 --> 01:08:34.940]   But I think he is doing pretty well.
[01:08:34.940 --> 01:08:35.940]   He says it's a paywall.
[01:08:35.940 --> 01:08:37.740]   You have to pay to see it, right?
[01:08:37.740 --> 01:08:39.700]   It's a reasonable price.
[01:08:39.700 --> 01:08:41.460]   It's not 400 bucks.
[01:08:41.460 --> 01:08:44.700]   And he claims he has, I can remember, was 30 or 40,000 subscribers.
[01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:46.060]   Whatever comes from 600,000.
[01:08:46.060 --> 01:08:47.060]   Yeah.
[01:08:47.060 --> 01:08:48.420]   Or so.
[01:08:48.420 --> 01:08:50.780]   So I'm glad to see all these models.
[01:08:50.780 --> 01:08:51.780]   I don't have any problems.
[01:08:51.780 --> 01:08:53.700]   So it's $20 a year.
[01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:54.700]   It's a tip jar.
[01:08:54.700 --> 01:08:55.700]   It's not payment.
[01:08:55.700 --> 01:08:57.700]   It's a subscription.
[01:08:57.700 --> 01:09:01.460]   34,000 subscriptions generating more than 875,000 in revenue.
[01:09:01.460 --> 01:09:02.460]   He'd set a goal for 900,000.
[01:09:02.460 --> 01:09:05.260]   I think he takes out two bucks a month or something like that.
[01:09:05.260 --> 01:09:06.260]   It's weird.
[01:09:06.260 --> 01:09:07.740]   I keep logging into my iPad to try to read.
[01:09:07.740 --> 01:09:08.740]   I'm still paying for it.
[01:09:08.740 --> 01:09:11.900]   I try to read the daily, every day.
[01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:13.420]   And I don't know what happened to it.
[01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:14.420]   I keep trying to run again.
[01:09:14.420 --> 01:09:17.100]   I said, oh, is that what happened?
[01:09:17.100 --> 01:09:18.100]   Yeah.
[01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:19.100]   Are you joking?
[01:09:19.100 --> 01:09:20.100]   You're joking now.
[01:09:20.100 --> 01:09:22.180]   That's Rupert Murdoch's 99 cent a week.
[01:09:22.180 --> 01:09:23.740]   He hired a hundred journalists.
[01:09:23.740 --> 01:09:25.500]   That was dead on the rival.
[01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:26.500]   Come on.
[01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:30.620]   Well, I mean, it was flawed from the beginning because you're hiring hundreds of people and
[01:09:30.620 --> 01:09:32.780]   throwing millions of dollars at something.
[01:09:32.780 --> 01:09:34.380]   But I'd like to see the experiment.
[01:09:34.380 --> 01:09:35.380]   I love the idea.
[01:09:35.380 --> 01:09:36.380]   I did too.
[01:09:36.380 --> 01:09:37.380]   And I was excited about it.
[01:09:37.380 --> 01:09:39.820]   My wife and I both subscribed to it.
[01:09:39.820 --> 01:09:43.380]   But then when I started seeing that most of the articles were just repurposed, associated,
[01:09:43.380 --> 01:09:46.220]   a lot of them were repurposed, associated press articles.
[01:09:46.220 --> 01:09:49.820]   I can just, I can get that in eight other apps that I have.
[01:09:49.820 --> 01:09:52.460]   And I want to see original content.
[01:09:52.460 --> 01:09:53.460]   Horrorless.
[01:09:53.460 --> 01:09:54.460]   I'm sorry.
[01:09:54.460 --> 01:09:55.460]   Horrorless.
[01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:57.980]   No, no, they tried some interesting things there.
[01:09:57.980 --> 01:10:00.500]   They hired some during the Mississippi flooding.
[01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:02.020]   They were actually the only company that they had.
[01:10:02.020 --> 01:10:07.020]   They hired a drone and they actually hired real pictures of the flooding and no other
[01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:08.180]   news organization did.
[01:10:08.180 --> 01:10:09.940]   So the daily was trying some things.
[01:10:09.940 --> 01:10:13.700]   It just was, I think, a flawed, flawed platform.
[01:10:13.700 --> 01:10:18.820]   Horrorless and I on the DHM Plugged Stock Market podcast we do once a week.
[01:10:18.820 --> 01:10:22.140]   We're going to put a paywall up for the second half of the show where we have, you know,
[01:10:22.140 --> 01:10:26.220]   their kind of our discussion of actual stocks.
[01:10:26.220 --> 01:10:27.820]   And it's going to be like, you know,
[01:10:27.820 --> 01:10:31.380]   we always, you and I always thought that there were some things that you could do where you
[01:10:31.380 --> 01:10:32.460]   could charge money.
[01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:34.140]   If people made money, for instance.
[01:10:34.140 --> 01:10:35.540]   Well, yeah, it doesn't take much.
[01:10:35.540 --> 01:10:38.660]   And so I think the stock thing, and that's why I think the Wall Street Journal did well
[01:10:38.660 --> 01:10:42.140]   when it first put up his paywall, but then after a while it started to fail.
[01:10:42.140 --> 01:10:46.900]   Well, it doesn't just come down to value if you're bringing real value to people on
[01:10:46.900 --> 01:10:48.380]   a consistent basis.
[01:10:48.380 --> 01:10:49.380]   Right.
[01:10:49.380 --> 01:10:53.260]   You know, Leo, to your point about Jessica Lesson stuff, maybe because of the investing
[01:10:53.260 --> 01:10:55.500]   angle it might not be valuable to you.
[01:10:55.500 --> 01:10:57.500]   But if you're bringing that value, you might fake it.
[01:10:57.500 --> 01:11:00.660]   Yeah, it might be making them thousands of dollars.
[01:11:00.660 --> 01:11:02.060]   So $400 to them is nothing.
[01:11:02.060 --> 01:11:03.060]   Right.
[01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:05.460]   It's a question of who's paying to if you look at Jessica Lesson's content, there's
[01:11:05.460 --> 01:11:09.580]   a good chance that a lot of her subscribers are actually being paid by their employers.
[01:11:09.580 --> 01:11:14.220]   They're able to expense that expense $400 a year.
[01:11:14.220 --> 01:11:16.820]   Or as you know, the daily was a personal expense for a lot of people.
[01:11:16.820 --> 01:11:19.580]   So you know, if you cross in that threshold where this is a professional expense, something
[01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:23.380]   that they can write off their taxes or something they can get their employer to pay, then obviously
[01:11:23.380 --> 01:11:28.420]   the boundary that threshold of what's acceptable goes up a lot higher.
[01:11:28.420 --> 01:11:36.100]   So apparently maybe part of the Gmail bug, but thousands of emails were being sent to
[01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:38.500]   David Peck's Hotmail account.
[01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:39.500]   Nice.
[01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:42.500]   It's a new denial of service.
[01:11:42.500 --> 01:11:43.900]   It's a bug in Google search.
[01:11:43.900 --> 01:11:44.900]   TechCrunch found this out.
[01:11:44.900 --> 01:11:51.020]   Sarah Perez wrote about it, which is pointing users directly to David Peck's email address.
[01:11:51.020 --> 01:12:00.220]   So if you open the compose window on Gmail, you get autofill.
[01:12:00.220 --> 01:12:03.540]   But apparently for some reason, his email is the first to pop us up.
[01:12:03.540 --> 01:12:07.860]   You don't think this is fishy.
[01:12:07.860 --> 01:12:13.060]   And his address, which is DSP 559 at Hotmail, I'm sure it's long ago.
[01:12:13.060 --> 01:12:17.300]   But nobody and TechCrunch says none of this is in our address books, but it's been filled
[01:12:17.300 --> 01:12:19.260]   in.
[01:12:19.260 --> 01:12:25.220]   After Google search surfaces who this address belongs to David as Peck of Fresno, he says
[01:12:25.220 --> 01:12:29.660]   he's been receiving thousands of emails, the majority of which are blank.
[01:12:29.660 --> 01:12:31.020]   500 an hour.
[01:12:31.020 --> 01:12:32.220]   I can't stop them.
[01:12:32.220 --> 01:12:35.140]   He says, I can't stop them.
[01:12:35.140 --> 01:12:36.140]   Better hope.
[01:12:36.140 --> 01:12:37.140]   500 an hour.
[01:12:37.140 --> 01:12:38.140]   That's a lot.
[01:12:38.140 --> 01:12:39.140]   Yeah.
[01:12:39.140 --> 01:12:40.140]   Just kill the account hell with it.
[01:12:40.140 --> 01:12:41.140]   So I do.
[01:12:41.140 --> 01:12:46.500]   A Google person says, spokesperson says, due to a technical glitch, some email addresses
[01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:49.300]   on public web pages appeared too prominently in search results.
[01:12:49.300 --> 01:12:54.700]   We fixed this issue and are sorry for any convenience caused to David S. Peck of Fresno,
[01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:55.700]   California.
[01:12:55.700 --> 01:13:00.420]   I'm telling you, somebody was out to get David or David was messing around possibly.
[01:13:00.420 --> 01:13:02.980]   He wrote one, two, many guest blogs.
[01:13:02.980 --> 01:13:06.060]   And that's how Google back.
[01:13:06.060 --> 01:13:07.060]   Yeah.
[01:13:07.060 --> 01:13:10.780]   Matt cuts mad at what he said, I will cut you off.
[01:13:10.780 --> 01:13:17.260]   We'll talk about the great firewall of China heading all of its traffic to where a little
[01:13:17.260 --> 01:13:19.180]   town in Montana, I think.
[01:13:19.180 --> 01:13:23.220]   That was another strange thing.
[01:13:23.220 --> 01:13:26.740]   But first a word from fresh books.
[01:13:26.740 --> 01:13:31.740]   If you are a small business, you know that probably the worst time of the year or the
[01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:34.780]   month, I should say, as the end of the month when you got to do your invoicing, I always
[01:13:34.780 --> 01:13:35.980]   hated that.
[01:13:35.980 --> 01:13:40.740]   If you know it gets you, if you're using Microsoft Word or Excel to do your invoices, do your
[01:13:40.740 --> 01:13:44.420]   you have a shoebox of receipts that keep track of your expenses?
[01:13:44.420 --> 01:13:46.140]   Right about now you're digging them out, right?
[01:13:46.140 --> 01:13:47.900]   Tax time's coming.
[01:13:47.900 --> 01:13:53.420]   How about in 2014, turn over a new leaf and save time, get paid faster, keep track of
[01:13:53.420 --> 01:13:56.140]   all your stuff with fresh books.
[01:13:56.140 --> 01:13:59.460]   The easy way to send invoices, manage expenses, track your time.
[01:13:59.460 --> 01:14:02.620]   It's a cloud accounting solution that is so simple.
[01:14:02.620 --> 01:14:08.100]   I actually started using this in 2004 when I was invoicing a bunch of different people
[01:14:08.100 --> 01:14:10.780]   for work I was doing, including Rogers in Canada.
[01:14:10.780 --> 01:14:12.980]   I had different currencies.
[01:14:12.980 --> 01:14:14.620]   I had Canadian dollars.
[01:14:14.620 --> 01:14:17.620]   Amber McCarthy said, "Try fresh books with this new thing.
[01:14:17.620 --> 01:14:19.220]   I loved it.
[01:14:19.220 --> 01:14:20.220]   I loved it.
[01:14:20.220 --> 01:14:24.740]   I easily create invoices online, capture and track expenses on the go, get real-time business
[01:14:24.740 --> 01:14:26.300]   reports with a few simple clicks.
[01:14:26.300 --> 01:14:28.300]   You'll get paid faster.
[01:14:28.300 --> 01:14:32.420]   There's even, if you and your client agree you can have the invoicing and the payments
[01:14:32.420 --> 01:14:34.940]   automatically done by fresh books.
[01:14:34.940 --> 01:14:38.220]   There's even a pay me now button and the email fresh books sends out.
[01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:40.260]   It's just really, really great.
[01:14:40.260 --> 01:14:45.580]   Put your business in the palm of your hand, free for 30 days at getfreshbooks.com.
[01:14:45.580 --> 01:14:49.660]   Here's a little way fresh books is thanking Twit listeners who join up.
[01:14:49.660 --> 01:14:52.620]   Make sure when you see the, "How did you hear about it?"
[01:14:52.620 --> 01:14:54.820]   You write, "This week in tech."
[01:14:54.820 --> 01:14:57.820]   Can they write Twitly sir just this week in tech?
[01:14:57.820 --> 01:15:01.380]   Write this week in tech just first safe because I want you to be in the drawing every day.
[01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:05.580]   You're giving away a birthday cake to somebody who signs up and says, "This week in tech"
[01:15:05.580 --> 01:15:07.220]   for a new account.
[01:15:07.220 --> 01:15:09.820]   Getfreshbooks.com.
[01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:10.980]   We've had the birthday cake.
[01:15:10.980 --> 01:15:11.980]   It's really good.
[01:15:11.980 --> 01:15:14.700]   It's not just like some grocery store cake.
[01:15:14.700 --> 01:15:16.340]   It's a really good cake.
[01:15:16.340 --> 01:15:19.180]   Getfreshbooks.com.
[01:15:19.180 --> 01:15:26.380]   Apparently, there was a misconfiguration.
[01:15:26.380 --> 01:15:30.660]   We think it was in the great firewall of China.
[01:15:30.660 --> 01:15:36.900]   It put as many as two-thirds of the country out of action for several hours.
[01:15:36.900 --> 01:15:43.780]   Oh, now I have to sign up for the financial times to read the rest of this story.
[01:15:43.780 --> 01:15:45.860]   Gosh darn you paywalls.
[01:15:45.860 --> 01:15:47.620]   Let me see if stinks.
[01:15:47.620 --> 01:15:50.780]   Let me see if my consistent works.
[01:15:50.780 --> 01:15:53.300]   What does everybody do?
[01:15:53.300 --> 01:15:55.460]   You go to another source that doesn't charge.
[01:15:55.460 --> 01:15:56.460]   You know what?
[01:15:56.460 --> 01:16:00.100]   Here's how I'll give you a trick for people out there who never thought of this.
[01:16:00.100 --> 01:16:03.420]   Make that and just clip the headline and put it in Google.
[01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:04.420]   Yeah.
[01:16:04.420 --> 01:16:05.420]   Boom.
[01:16:05.420 --> 01:16:06.420]   And you find it.
[01:16:06.420 --> 01:16:07.420]   Because nobody ever realized headlines.
[01:16:07.420 --> 01:16:08.420]   Right.
[01:16:08.420 --> 01:16:09.420]   And so bang you get it.
[01:16:09.420 --> 01:16:12.380]   So apparently, I would guess it was one of their big routers.
[01:16:12.380 --> 01:16:18.300]   It was redirecting all Chinese DNS traffic to this small building in Cheyenne, Wyoming.
[01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:19.300]   Wow.
[01:16:19.300 --> 01:16:23.940]   Who owns the building?
[01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:28.300]   Perhaps the biggest failure in internet history.
[01:16:28.300 --> 01:16:33.020]   So this company, this is basically a front.
[01:16:33.020 --> 01:16:34.020]   For what?
[01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:35.020]   The CIA?
[01:16:35.020 --> 01:16:36.020]   No, no, no.
[01:16:36.020 --> 01:16:37.020]   The Chinese.
[01:16:37.020 --> 01:16:40.620]   You know how when you have a company and you can have somebody in a, in a, for instance,
[01:16:40.620 --> 01:16:42.900]   Delaware, we have a registered agent in Delaware.
[01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:44.620]   You got a guy in there's a little office.
[01:16:44.620 --> 01:16:47.700]   It's a little office and all of our corporate mail goes there because we're at Delaware
[01:16:47.700 --> 01:16:48.700]   Corporation.
[01:16:48.700 --> 01:16:50.380]   Somebody picks it up once a month.
[01:16:50.380 --> 01:16:52.820]   So apparently.
[01:16:52.820 --> 01:16:59.140]   So Fadiya, which is something a little shady, a company that is based on paper in this Wyoming
[01:16:59.140 --> 01:17:06.220]   building, perhaps is, well, it's controlled, they believe, by jailed former Ukrainian prime
[01:17:06.220 --> 01:17:07.220]   minister.
[01:17:07.220 --> 01:17:09.020]   Uh huh.
[01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:14.300]   And it's, it's a company charged with helping online poker operators evade gambling bans.
[01:17:14.300 --> 01:17:19.580]   Anyway, it's a very, this is from the, this is actually a better article anyway from the
[01:17:19.580 --> 01:17:22.580]   bits blog in the New York Times.
[01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:27.580]   Apparently, uh, what happened was the people who run the Great Wall of China, one of the
[01:17:27.580 --> 01:17:29.580]   things that they do is they block sites.
[01:17:29.580 --> 01:17:30.580]   They block Twitter.
[01:17:30.580 --> 01:17:31.580]   They block Facebook.
[01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:32.580]   Right.
[01:17:32.580 --> 01:17:36.180]   They also block proxy services that people use to get around the Great Firewall of China.
[01:17:36.180 --> 01:17:37.180]   Right.
[01:17:37.180 --> 01:17:38.180]   And VPNs.
[01:17:38.180 --> 01:17:44.940]   Technologists surmised that traffic, the Chinese internet sensors were trying to block traffic
[01:17:44.940 --> 01:17:50.220]   to so Fadiya, but mistakenly redirected all traffic from China to them.
[01:17:50.220 --> 01:17:51.220]   Nice.
[01:17:51.220 --> 01:17:53.540]   They flipped a bit.
[01:17:53.540 --> 01:17:58.580]   And instead of, you know, the rule says, no, buddy can go there.
[01:17:58.580 --> 01:18:01.460]   Instead, it said everybody must go there.
[01:18:01.460 --> 01:18:02.460]   That's interesting.
[01:18:02.460 --> 01:18:06.340]   That helped the population is 61,000 people in Cheyenne never had them.
[01:18:06.340 --> 01:18:08.620]   That's some way of making money off that deal.
[01:18:08.620 --> 01:18:13.580]   It just shows you, you know, the internet's too complicated for humans.
[01:18:13.580 --> 01:18:15.660]   Um, anyway, it was only a few hours.
[01:18:15.660 --> 01:18:21.900]   Ah, they, I know nearly every Chinese user and internet company, including Baidu, which
[01:18:21.900 --> 01:18:29.460]   is the Google of China, was brought down, actually was up to eight hours last Tuesday.
[01:18:29.460 --> 01:18:35.580]   Most of China's half billion internet users could not load websites, including Baidu and
[01:18:35.580 --> 01:18:36.580]   Sina.
[01:18:36.580 --> 01:18:40.780]   Uh, there's been a lot of these weird things going on.
[01:18:40.780 --> 01:18:41.780]   Yeah.
[01:18:41.780 --> 01:18:48.020]   Uh, Omaha, do you hear about the city of Omaha, Nebraska after Peyton Manning was yelling
[01:18:48.020 --> 01:18:49.900]   at that game a few weeks ago?
[01:18:49.900 --> 01:18:52.500]   Omaha, he was, yeah, that's his, that's an audible.
[01:18:52.500 --> 01:18:54.740]   In fact, they often use cities for audibles.
[01:18:54.740 --> 01:18:56.260]   I hear that all the time.
[01:18:56.260 --> 01:18:59.780]   So Cheyenne and Omaha were like trending for reason.
[01:18:59.780 --> 01:19:02.580]   Why does Peyton Manning keep shouting Omaha?
[01:19:02.580 --> 01:19:06.020]   So the city of Omaha, like the Chamber of Commerce, they jumped on people are retweeting
[01:19:06.020 --> 01:19:07.020]   it like crazy.
[01:19:07.020 --> 01:19:08.820]   They jumped on all this ads revenue.
[01:19:08.820 --> 01:19:12.860]   The hotels have been selling out because people are going to Omaha and really people are flying
[01:19:12.860 --> 01:19:16.060]   to Omaha because he mentions it during a game.
[01:19:16.060 --> 01:19:21.220]   You know, speaking of the NFL who owned the internet this week.
[01:19:21.220 --> 01:19:22.220]   Yeah.
[01:19:22.220 --> 01:19:23.220]   Who was the guy?
[01:19:23.220 --> 01:19:24.220]   Richard Sherman.
[01:19:24.220 --> 01:19:25.220]   Yes.
[01:19:25.220 --> 01:19:26.220]   What about him?
[01:19:26.220 --> 01:19:27.780]   Seattle Seahawks, Richard Sherman.
[01:19:27.780 --> 01:19:33.460]   If you watched the Niners, see how he's going out crap at the very end freaks.
[01:19:33.460 --> 01:19:40.460]   It was bizarre. The line reporter asks him, you know, what did Aaron Andrews, Aaron Andrews,
[01:19:40.460 --> 01:19:42.060]   what did that last play?
[01:19:42.060 --> 01:19:43.500]   I could play a little bit of it for you.
[01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:44.500]   It was just bizarre.
[01:19:44.500 --> 01:19:46.340]   They actually cut away some.
[01:19:46.340 --> 01:19:49.780]   There was a decision made in the booth that you know, yeah, stay with it because this is
[01:19:49.780 --> 01:19:52.300]   good TV or cut away before he starts cussing.
[01:19:52.300 --> 01:19:53.580]   And what would you have done?
[01:19:53.580 --> 01:19:57.700]   I would have cut away because I thought you know, because of the props to Aaron Andrews.
[01:19:57.700 --> 01:19:59.900]   Because she handled it.
[01:19:59.900 --> 01:20:01.140]   She did not freak.
[01:20:01.140 --> 01:20:02.140]   I would have.
[01:20:02.140 --> 01:20:06.620]   That grimace jetted one of those looks on her face at least for his like all this.
[01:20:06.620 --> 01:20:09.660]   Because you know, I mean, in telling you know, in broadcasting you guys, I mean, you know,
[01:20:09.660 --> 01:20:11.220]   something's gone south real fast.
[01:20:11.220 --> 01:20:12.380]   Oh, it went south here.
[01:20:12.380 --> 01:20:13.420]   Well, let's just watch.
[01:20:13.420 --> 01:20:15.340]   Can you are you getting my video, Chad?
[01:20:15.340 --> 01:20:17.060]   All right, let's just watch.
[01:20:17.060 --> 01:20:19.380]   This is after the game right after the game on the sidelines.
[01:20:19.380 --> 01:20:21.380]   Aaron Andrews talking to Richard Sherman.
[01:20:21.380 --> 01:20:22.380]   That's corner of the game.
[01:20:22.380 --> 01:20:23.380]   Well, let's get her question.
[01:20:23.380 --> 01:20:24.380]   No, the question comes later.
[01:20:24.380 --> 01:20:25.380]   Take me through it.
[01:20:25.380 --> 01:20:26.380]   Oh, yeah.
[01:20:26.380 --> 01:20:27.380]   That's corner of the game.
[01:20:27.380 --> 01:20:29.980]   Will you try me with a sorry, receiving like crap to you?
[01:20:29.980 --> 01:20:31.980]   That's the result you all get.
[01:20:31.980 --> 01:20:34.500]   Don't you ever talk about me.
[01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:36.580]   Who was talking about you?
[01:20:36.580 --> 01:20:38.180]   That's the best question.
[01:20:38.180 --> 01:20:40.380]   Don't you ever talk about me?
[01:20:40.380 --> 01:20:42.380]   Well, who was talking about you?
[01:20:42.380 --> 01:20:43.380]   It was great.
[01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:44.580]   Your eyes get really wide.
[01:20:44.580 --> 01:20:45.580]   Yeah.
[01:20:45.580 --> 01:20:49.140]   And then they do cut away, which is too bad because you know there was more action.
[01:20:49.140 --> 01:20:50.140]   I think he walks away.
[01:20:50.140 --> 01:20:51.940]   Are you almost satisfied?
[01:20:51.940 --> 01:20:52.940]   You're real.
[01:20:52.940 --> 01:20:53.940]   But they cut away.
[01:20:53.940 --> 01:20:54.940]   They cut away right.
[01:20:54.940 --> 01:20:55.940]   They cut away.
[01:20:55.940 --> 01:20:57.460]   They said, all right, guys, back to you.
[01:20:57.460 --> 01:21:00.260]   So I think now, OK, what do you think?
[01:21:00.260 --> 01:21:02.900]   Now, it's possible this guy, you know, it's a big game.
[01:21:02.900 --> 01:21:03.900]   He was fired up.
[01:21:03.900 --> 01:21:04.900]   He just lost his time.
[01:21:04.900 --> 01:21:06.700]   You don't watch much sports talk.
[01:21:06.700 --> 01:21:10.500]   There's trash talk, but you don't usually do it on camera to the networks.
[01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:11.500]   You do it.
[01:21:11.500 --> 01:21:17.260]   This is all these sports talk radio and sports talk TV and ESPN talked about all week.
[01:21:17.260 --> 01:21:18.260]   That's OK.
[01:21:18.260 --> 01:21:20.620]   So that's the other theory is that Sherman knew he's a very smart guy.
[01:21:20.620 --> 01:21:23.140]   I went to Stanford, very smart, very well spoken.
[01:21:23.140 --> 01:21:25.020]   You know exactly what he was doing.
[01:21:25.020 --> 01:21:27.420]   He got in a Twitter battle with Crabtree, right?
[01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:31.020]   But profit wasn't for him because he's famous.
[01:21:31.020 --> 01:21:32.020]   He's been famous.
[01:21:32.020 --> 01:21:33.700]   He's even more famous.
[01:21:33.700 --> 01:21:38.260]   I mean, the amount of who among us gets to play in a game like that, right?
[01:21:38.260 --> 01:21:39.740]   A championship game like that.
[01:21:39.740 --> 01:21:44.340]   And you block the pass that could have sent the 49ers to the site of all.
[01:21:44.340 --> 01:21:47.020]   He literally walks off the field right after that moment.
[01:21:47.020 --> 01:21:48.020]   That was the end of the game.
[01:21:48.020 --> 01:21:49.220]   Comes right to the sideline.
[01:21:49.220 --> 01:21:50.940]   He's still freaking out charged up.
[01:21:50.940 --> 01:21:55.500]   So if I, if that just happened to me, I don't know that I would have, you know, been able
[01:21:55.500 --> 01:21:59.700]   to calm down very calmly and just said, well, Aaron, thank you very much for the question.
[01:21:59.700 --> 01:22:02.300]   That's actually what all the sports guys said.
[01:22:02.300 --> 01:22:03.980]   They're crazy to do that.
[01:22:03.980 --> 01:22:08.300]   The guy said he's, everyone gets so worked up that game moment, especially after something
[01:22:08.300 --> 01:22:11.700]   like that, he just kind of lost it a little bit.
[01:22:11.700 --> 01:22:15.820]   I thought I mean, you know, part of it, I think that may be 50% of it.
[01:22:15.820 --> 01:22:20.340]   He said later that he was called a thug.
[01:22:20.340 --> 01:22:22.900]   And he said that's just a racial epithet, basically.
[01:22:22.900 --> 01:22:27.420]   That's another, that's an acceptable way of using the N word these days.
[01:22:27.420 --> 01:22:30.380]   I think he's a smart guy and I have to think he's using this as a publicity stunt.
[01:22:30.380 --> 01:22:35.100]   I think that the Twitter, the Twitter battle back and forth, but him and him was, he owned
[01:22:35.100 --> 01:22:36.100]   the internet for a day.
[01:22:36.100 --> 01:22:38.140]   I'll tell you what, more than the Great Wall of China.
[01:22:38.140 --> 01:22:39.140]   Yeah, I'll tell you.
[01:22:39.140 --> 01:22:42.500]   Twitter had more, there were more tweets on Richard Sherman than anything else during
[01:22:42.500 --> 01:22:43.500]   the week, I think.
[01:22:43.500 --> 01:22:44.500]   Exactly.
[01:22:44.500 --> 01:22:49.620]   Here's why I think that was, if you're right, this was a hugely, a huge mistake and a bad
[01:22:49.620 --> 01:22:50.620]   decision.
[01:22:50.620 --> 01:22:51.620]   Why?
[01:22:51.620 --> 01:22:55.660]   Because what he's managed to do, especially after that, the choke signal and all that
[01:22:55.660 --> 01:22:59.340]   stuff, he drew so much attention to himself that you have to know that the referees in
[01:22:59.340 --> 01:23:04.060]   their pregame meetings are going to say, we better keep an eye on this guy and they're
[01:23:04.060 --> 01:23:05.260]   going to keep an eye on this guy.
[01:23:05.260 --> 01:23:06.980]   And he's a major holder.
[01:23:06.980 --> 01:23:09.020]   He likes to hold the receivers.
[01:23:09.020 --> 01:23:11.260]   He likes to, he does a lot of past interference.
[01:23:11.260 --> 01:23:12.680]   He gets away with a lot.
[01:23:12.680 --> 01:23:16.700]   He is going to get called for at least two or three penalties that otherwise may not have
[01:23:16.700 --> 01:23:17.700]   been held.
[01:23:17.700 --> 01:23:20.500]   I was after wondering what his teammates think, you know, apparently they don't care.
[01:23:20.500 --> 01:23:21.500]   They think that's just Richard.
[01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:22.500]   That's Richard.
[01:23:22.500 --> 01:23:23.500]   That's where you, yeah.
[01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:27.740]   But that's just, you know, so I think that Peyton and his boys are going to win that
[01:23:27.740 --> 01:23:28.740]   game.
[01:23:28.740 --> 01:23:31.620]   I'm moving to South Korea.
[01:23:31.620 --> 01:23:36.780]   I'm just saying it now and not because of the closer to your North Korean relatives.
[01:23:36.780 --> 01:23:38.780]   Yes.
[01:23:38.780 --> 01:23:39.780]   Because two things.
[01:23:39.780 --> 01:23:48.140]   First of all, they're now getting a 300 megabit LTE in Korea.
[01:23:48.140 --> 01:23:53.020]   Green carriers are going to launch a new LTE advanced network that will get 300 megabits
[01:23:53.020 --> 01:23:54.020]   down.
[01:23:54.020 --> 01:24:01.220]   They're going to aggregate three, three brands together and they say, hey, later on, we're
[01:24:01.220 --> 01:24:02.220]   going to go to 450.
[01:24:02.220 --> 01:24:06.300]   Now, Tim, correct me if I'm wrong, but isn't this the country that has like the largest
[01:24:06.300 --> 01:24:08.220]   population of internet addicts?
[01:24:08.220 --> 01:24:10.300]   They have like clinics set up all over the country.
[01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:11.300]   Absolutely.
[01:24:11.300 --> 01:24:14.700]   They have camps that they send their kids to who can, you know, they can't get off the
[01:24:14.700 --> 01:24:15.700]   internet.
[01:24:15.700 --> 01:24:16.700]   They can't stop playing Starcraft.
[01:24:16.700 --> 01:24:19.860]   They'll get sent away to camp for a week or two and.
[01:24:19.860 --> 01:24:23.100]   Was that a pocket full of guy who's bladder burst when he was because he couldn't stop
[01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:24.100]   playing Starcraft?
[01:24:24.100 --> 01:24:25.580]   I believe that was there as well.
[01:24:25.580 --> 01:24:26.580]   Yeah.
[01:24:26.580 --> 01:24:30.060]   It's, you know, it's a very passionate country full of passion for mostly Starcraft, but
[01:24:30.060 --> 01:24:33.780]   also for downloads and a hate for pre-installed apps, which is great.
[01:24:33.780 --> 01:24:35.260]   I think that's something we can all aspire to.
[01:24:35.260 --> 01:24:37.900]   I sure did get fined over $7,000.
[01:24:37.900 --> 01:24:41.700]   Oh, seven, seven, no, no, no, not for that.
[01:24:41.700 --> 01:24:42.700]   Not for that.
[01:24:42.700 --> 01:24:44.900]   No, after the play, remember, he put up his.
[01:24:44.900 --> 01:24:46.900]   Yeah, he did that.
[01:24:46.900 --> 01:24:47.900]   That was on the field.
[01:24:47.900 --> 01:24:48.900]   But he also came up to.
[01:24:48.900 --> 01:24:49.900]   He tried to shake his hand.
[01:24:49.900 --> 01:24:50.900]   That's bull crap.
[01:24:50.900 --> 01:24:52.100]   He was yakking at him.
[01:24:52.100 --> 01:24:55.900]   And then when they, when they threw the flag on him doing the choking sign, then he held
[01:24:55.900 --> 01:24:58.340]   his hand out to make it look like it was doing something else.
[01:24:58.340 --> 01:24:59.340]   That was bull.
[01:24:59.340 --> 01:25:01.180]   All right.
[01:25:01.180 --> 01:25:03.900]   The other reason I'm moving to South Korea, South Korea rules.
[01:25:03.900 --> 01:25:04.900]   Yeah, I'm a football fan.
[01:25:04.900 --> 01:25:05.900]   Yeah, I guess so.
[01:25:05.900 --> 01:25:11.620]   South Korea rules pre-installed phone bloatware must be deletable.
[01:25:11.620 --> 01:25:14.100]   Why can't why can't we do this?
[01:25:14.100 --> 01:25:18.940]   That means no Samsung Galaxy phones will be able to be sold there.
[01:25:18.940 --> 01:25:23.780]   I just saw a graphic that showed how much free space there is on a 16 gig phone.
[01:25:23.780 --> 01:25:24.780]   None.
[01:25:24.780 --> 01:25:29.020]   And it's literally half of it on a Samsung Galaxy S4 is taken up by bloatware.
[01:25:29.020 --> 01:25:30.020]   Half of us.
[01:25:30.020 --> 01:25:32.780]   Well, you need that golf photography.
[01:25:32.780 --> 01:25:33.780]   Yeah.
[01:25:33.780 --> 01:25:36.260]   That's the one I always come up with.
[01:25:36.260 --> 01:25:38.380]   I don't think you must play golf though.
[01:25:38.380 --> 01:25:40.220]   You look like you play golf.
[01:25:40.220 --> 01:25:42.820]   I used to play, but I hurt my back.
[01:25:42.820 --> 01:25:45.540]   It's like the worst thing in the world you can do for your back.
[01:25:45.540 --> 01:25:50.100]   But even still, even if I did play golf, I couldn't imagine the golf swing camera.
[01:25:50.100 --> 01:25:53.940]   Yeah, the rare use case that you would get from that camera mode.
[01:25:53.940 --> 01:25:56.020]   Hey, dad, I want to get this.
[01:25:56.020 --> 01:26:01.540]   I actually have a mode on my camera that can elegantly get some swing.
[01:26:01.540 --> 01:26:11.260]   The S4 has 80 apps pre-installed, 25 loaded by, in Korea by the Telco, 39 by Samsung,
[01:26:11.260 --> 01:26:13.540]   16 from Google.
[01:26:13.540 --> 01:26:14.540]   There it is.
[01:26:14.540 --> 01:26:15.540]   There's the graphic.
[01:26:15.540 --> 01:26:19.060]   And I've the least, the least intrusive is the iPhone 5C.
[01:26:19.060 --> 01:26:22.620]   You get 12.6 free megabytes on a 16 gig phone.
[01:26:22.620 --> 01:26:23.780]   The worst is the S4.
[01:26:23.780 --> 01:26:25.980]   You get 8.5 megabytes free.
[01:26:25.980 --> 01:26:26.980]   Gigabytes.
[01:26:26.980 --> 01:26:27.980]   Gigabytes.
[01:26:27.980 --> 01:26:31.780]   Yeah, that would be bad if you had 8.5 megabytes.
[01:26:31.780 --> 01:26:35.020]   That would not be good.
[01:26:35.020 --> 01:26:39.180]   The Nexus 5, I'll give you the list in case you want to know the 5C, the Nexus 5, the
[01:26:39.180 --> 01:26:44.980]   Sony Xperia Z1, the BlackBerry Z30, the HTC One Mini and the LG.
[01:26:44.980 --> 01:26:45.980]   Zed?
[01:26:45.980 --> 01:26:50.820]   I'm going to call it Zed because in honor of my Canadian friends.
[01:26:50.820 --> 01:26:52.340]   Z is not a good word.
[01:26:52.340 --> 01:26:53.340]   It's Zed.
[01:26:53.340 --> 01:26:55.020]   That's what they do in Europe.
[01:26:55.020 --> 01:26:56.020]   Yeah.
[01:26:56.020 --> 01:26:57.020]   Don't you think?
[01:26:57.020 --> 01:26:58.020]   Z?
[01:26:58.020 --> 01:26:59.020]   What kind of word is Z?
[01:26:59.020 --> 01:27:00.180]   When you get hurt, do you go to hospital?
[01:27:00.180 --> 01:27:01.340]   You go to a Z hospital.
[01:27:01.340 --> 01:27:03.260]   Well, a Z, that would be different.
[01:27:03.260 --> 01:27:04.260]   Anyway, I'll move it.
[01:27:04.260 --> 01:27:07.820]   There's an interesting application of this South Korea ruling, which is that it's not
[01:27:07.820 --> 01:27:10.620]   only the stuff that we don't want, it's the stuff that we actually do want.
[01:27:10.620 --> 01:27:16.460]   So things like Gmail and Google Maps, Google Navigation, even potentially Siri, those things
[01:27:16.460 --> 01:27:20.860]   could also be covered by this ruling too, which could mean some pretty extensive changes
[01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:25.580]   to these mobile operating systems to be able to rip those things out much like Microsoft
[01:27:25.580 --> 01:27:29.940]   had to rip out IE from what I could think it was Windows 95 back in the day.
[01:27:29.940 --> 01:27:31.500]   Well, they're not saying though, this is important.
[01:27:31.500 --> 01:27:33.180]   They're not saying it has to get rid of it.
[01:27:33.180 --> 01:27:35.180]   Just you can uninstall it if you want to.
[01:27:35.180 --> 01:27:36.180]   Right.
[01:27:36.180 --> 01:27:38.180]   You can't do it if you want to uninstall Siri right now.
[01:27:38.180 --> 01:27:39.180]   Right.
[01:27:39.180 --> 01:27:41.220]   So that would be a pretty big change for iOS, I think.
[01:27:41.220 --> 01:27:43.380]   And of course, Apple wants to be present in South Korea.
[01:27:43.380 --> 01:27:48.380]   So how exactly they're going to draw the line between quote unquote bloatware and application
[01:27:48.380 --> 01:27:53.540]   for iOS functionality that remains to be seen, but certainly those things are apps.
[01:27:53.540 --> 01:27:55.820]   And so you should be able to uninstall them as well.
[01:27:55.820 --> 01:27:59.420]   Ken from Chicago in our chatroom says, "Nantech, he's actually like bloatware.
[01:27:59.420 --> 01:28:00.780]   They see it as free software."
[01:28:00.780 --> 01:28:02.820]   I don't think that's true.
[01:28:02.820 --> 01:28:04.980]   I think Siri would be considered that.
[01:28:04.980 --> 01:28:05.980]   I think there is something.
[01:28:05.980 --> 01:28:06.980]   I think there's a difference.
[01:28:06.980 --> 01:28:07.980]   Siri is.
[01:28:07.980 --> 01:28:11.100]   But free software is one thing and crap that they put on the phone is another.
[01:28:11.100 --> 01:28:12.100]   Right.
[01:28:12.100 --> 01:28:13.100]   And it's pretty obvious.
[01:28:13.100 --> 01:28:14.100]   It's like porn.
[01:28:14.100 --> 01:28:15.100]   You can tell it when you see it.
[01:28:15.100 --> 01:28:16.100]   This was a big problem on PCs.
[01:28:16.100 --> 01:28:20.620]   That's why Microsoft created signature PCs because Windows would come from HP particularly,
[01:28:20.620 --> 01:28:22.340]   but it would come larded with crap.
[01:28:22.340 --> 01:28:23.340]   With crap.
[01:28:23.340 --> 01:28:24.340]   With trialware.
[01:28:24.340 --> 01:28:25.340]   Yeah.
[01:28:25.340 --> 01:28:26.340]   There was just worse because it's not even fully functional.
[01:28:26.340 --> 01:28:29.620]   McAfee for three weeks or something.
[01:28:29.620 --> 01:28:33.820]   This news just breaking Google and Samsung have agreed to license, to cross license to
[01:28:33.820 --> 01:28:36.060]   each other's patents for 10 years.
[01:28:36.060 --> 01:28:41.260]   Google and Samsung have, but see, they really were, it was Apple that was the problem.
[01:28:41.260 --> 01:28:47.260]   Microsoft a little bit too with his rock star patent troll that they had created.
[01:28:47.260 --> 01:28:53.020]   Google and Samsung obviously are in the Android camp, so they have agreed to license.
[01:28:53.020 --> 01:28:57.100]   So if you were worried about the threat of lawsuits, worry no more.
[01:28:57.100 --> 01:28:58.660]   I've never bothered me.
[01:28:58.660 --> 01:29:03.660]   Never bothered me either.
[01:29:03.660 --> 01:29:08.980]   I don't, this is the worst week for us.
[01:29:08.980 --> 01:29:13.580]   So we've had every story you've talked so far about, which is a funny construction.
[01:29:13.580 --> 01:29:15.660]   It has been fantastic.
[01:29:15.660 --> 01:29:17.500]   There's the Qualcomm patent buy from HP.
[01:29:17.500 --> 01:29:18.940]   I thought that was pretty interesting.
[01:29:18.940 --> 01:29:19.940]   What did they buy?
[01:29:19.940 --> 01:29:24.220]   They bought a lot of patents from Hewlett Packard, including the old IPAC brand from back in
[01:29:24.220 --> 01:29:25.220]   the day.
[01:29:25.220 --> 01:29:28.300]   But also, the, um, the, um, the Palm, wow, the IPAC as well.
[01:29:28.300 --> 01:29:30.380]   So they bought IPAC and Palm.
[01:29:30.380 --> 01:29:33.640]   So a lot of patents related to mobile devices, which is interesting because Qualcomm's
[01:29:33.640 --> 01:29:37.540]   just released the talk of course, which is, you know, they make components, but it's
[01:29:37.540 --> 01:29:39.900]   not too often that Qualcomm makes an actual device.
[01:29:39.900 --> 01:29:43.980]   Now they bought a bunch of patents that all relate to devices, which makes me wonder if
[01:29:43.980 --> 01:29:47.860]   Qualcomm isn't going to be making more devices in the future.
[01:29:47.860 --> 01:29:50.020]   That's a good one.
[01:29:50.020 --> 01:29:52.020]   The also interested in Netflix too.
[01:29:52.020 --> 01:29:56.140]   And they wanted to have a three tier payment plan.
[01:29:56.140 --> 01:29:57.140]   Is that right?
[01:29:57.140 --> 01:29:58.140]   Yeah.
[01:29:58.140 --> 01:29:59.140]   What's the different tiers?
[01:29:59.140 --> 01:30:00.140]   Um, yeah.
[01:30:00.140 --> 01:30:03.580]   I mean, it's, but new for new people only.
[01:30:03.580 --> 01:30:04.580]   Right.
[01:30:04.580 --> 01:30:10.880]   So it would have, well, they have 44 million members right now, which is pretty mind blowing.
[01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:11.880]   Wow.
[01:30:11.880 --> 01:30:14.520]   And you think about what they've had and you think about the awards that they were able
[01:30:14.520 --> 01:30:18.480]   to get at the, um, uh, at the Golden Globes.
[01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:19.480]   Yeah.
[01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:22.840]   You had some, um, some of their, some of their, uh, some of their programming, uh, winning
[01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:23.840]   Golden Globes for the first time.
[01:30:23.840 --> 01:30:25.160]   Aren't you the new black was nominated?
[01:30:25.160 --> 01:30:27.840]   Uh, Kevin Spacey's house cards was nominated.
[01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:32.120]   I think one, uh, coming back now for multiple seasons.
[01:30:32.120 --> 01:30:33.520]   Um, great stuff.
[01:30:33.520 --> 01:30:34.520]   Yeah.
[01:30:34.520 --> 01:30:38.520]   So it'd be interesting to see the different stream variants that you could pay for and
[01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:39.520]   get.
[01:30:39.520 --> 01:30:41.800]   I don't know the people would be really aware though what they have in their house and
[01:30:41.800 --> 01:30:43.440]   what they would want to pay for.
[01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:46.720]   And this is a part of the cord cutting, uh, thing that's taking place.
[01:30:46.720 --> 01:30:48.880]   Of course you have a show or you did or we did.
[01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:50.880]   But we want to launch a new one because I think it's a big story.
[01:30:50.880 --> 01:30:55.800]   And I should mention is I had a professional finally, I've always had a big fan of over
[01:30:55.800 --> 01:30:58.080]   the air, uh, which broadcast.
[01:30:58.080 --> 01:31:00.960]   So I finally had some guy come over and put an antenna up on the roof.
[01:31:00.960 --> 01:31:04.640]   Now you lived here enough to Oakland and San Francisco that you could probably get over
[01:31:04.640 --> 01:31:05.740]   the year signals.
[01:31:05.740 --> 01:31:07.400]   You don't have to be that close.
[01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:10.320]   You can get most of those towers are on Mount Sutra and Sanford overlooking.
[01:31:10.320 --> 01:31:11.960]   I have one of the best shots at it.
[01:31:11.960 --> 01:31:12.960]   That's true.
[01:31:12.960 --> 01:31:13.960]   You can see it from your house.
[01:31:13.960 --> 01:31:14.960]   I can.
[01:31:14.960 --> 01:31:17.240]   But that's beside the point because most people will have good access over there if they
[01:31:17.240 --> 01:31:18.240]   want to try it.
[01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:21.360]   But the guy says no, but you know, he's just picking up a little bit, but nobody's doing
[01:31:21.360 --> 01:31:22.360]   this.
[01:31:22.360 --> 01:31:25.040]   They're going along with complete cord cutting and they're not going.
[01:31:25.040 --> 01:31:27.840]   Or they're paying a hundred bucks a month for cable or more.
[01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:28.840]   So what do you think?
[01:31:28.840 --> 01:31:32.240]   They had to think, well, I pushed it on, hit the button to go scan the channel.
[01:31:32.240 --> 01:31:35.200]   How many channels do you think I get over the air?
[01:31:35.200 --> 01:31:36.200]   HD over the air.
[01:31:36.200 --> 01:31:37.680]   San Francisco Bay area.
[01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:38.680]   Yeah.
[01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:39.680]   What do you think?
[01:31:39.680 --> 01:31:43.720]   No, many more than that because like channel four, cron has like five different subjects.
[01:31:43.720 --> 01:31:44.720]   They have three.
[01:31:44.720 --> 01:31:46.680]   So you get a one HD two.
[01:31:46.680 --> 01:31:47.680]   They have two.
[01:31:47.680 --> 01:31:51.720]   They have old honeymooners rehounds like 24, seven, 87 channels.
[01:31:51.720 --> 01:31:52.720]   87.
[01:31:52.720 --> 01:31:53.720]   Wow.
[01:31:53.720 --> 01:31:54.720]   How many of those would you watch?
[01:31:54.720 --> 01:31:56.600]   How many of them are in Korean?
[01:31:56.600 --> 01:32:00.600]   Many are in Japanese, Korean, Chinese and Vietnamese.
[01:32:00.600 --> 01:32:03.480]   The guy says to me, he says, these guys can buy these.
[01:32:03.480 --> 01:32:04.840]   He says he knows it's cheap.
[01:32:04.840 --> 01:32:09.200]   Yeah, you can buy it channel cheap and it's a good way to communicate with your community.
[01:32:09.200 --> 01:32:10.200]   Yeah.
[01:32:10.200 --> 01:32:11.200]   Yeah.
[01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:12.200]   But 87.
[01:32:12.200 --> 01:32:16.920]   Anyway, that's I'm just saying people get an antenna, get a little tuner, see what you
[01:32:16.920 --> 01:32:17.920]   got there.
[01:32:17.920 --> 01:32:18.920]   You'd be surprised.
[01:32:18.920 --> 01:32:20.400]   I want to mention squarespace.com and we're going to wrap it up.
[01:32:20.400 --> 01:32:25.600]   I want to talk about why we can't say the word candy anymore.
[01:32:25.600 --> 01:32:32.440]   But first a word from the best place to go if you want to create a website, squarespace.com.
[01:32:32.440 --> 01:32:35.040]   I think you have a squarespace site, Mr. Clayton Morris.
[01:32:35.040 --> 01:32:36.040]   I do believe.
[01:32:36.040 --> 01:32:39.880]   Yeah, we have no agenda show.com agenda show.
[01:32:39.880 --> 01:32:43.160]   In fact, last time we were here, we tried to bring no agenda show.com.
[01:32:43.160 --> 01:32:44.160]   We couldn't bring it down.
[01:32:44.160 --> 01:32:45.160]   You went out of your way.
[01:32:45.160 --> 01:32:46.160]   Let's bring Clayton's site down.
[01:32:46.160 --> 01:32:47.320]   What is your squarespace?
[01:32:47.320 --> 01:32:49.800]   Well, I'm actually redoing it right now.
[01:32:49.800 --> 01:32:50.800]   Look at this.
[01:32:50.800 --> 01:32:51.800]   He's checking it out.
[01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:52.800]   No, I'm working on it.
[01:32:52.800 --> 01:32:53.800]   I'm working on it.
[01:32:53.800 --> 01:32:54.800]   Photographybegins.com.
[01:32:54.800 --> 01:32:55.800]   This is cool.
[01:32:55.800 --> 01:32:57.960]   Are you going to do a photography site?
[01:32:57.960 --> 01:32:58.960]   Photography site?
[01:32:58.960 --> 01:32:59.960]   I've had it for a while.
[01:32:59.960 --> 01:33:01.720]   It's being totally overhauled right now.
[01:33:01.720 --> 01:33:04.000]   Working on a podcast with it.
[01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:06.000]   For total beginners, so I've been--
[01:33:06.000 --> 01:33:07.000]   What a good idea.
[01:33:07.000 --> 01:33:08.000]   What a good idea.
[01:33:08.000 --> 01:33:10.440]   And you're using the-- you're shooting the NEX7.
[01:33:10.440 --> 01:33:14.240]   Yeah, the NEX7 about to play with the Sony AR7.
[01:33:14.240 --> 01:33:16.240]   A7R, I just got that.
[01:33:16.240 --> 01:33:17.240]   You did?
[01:33:17.240 --> 01:33:18.240]   Yeah, I just bought that.
[01:33:18.240 --> 01:33:19.240]   You just bought it all.
[01:33:19.240 --> 01:33:20.240]   You just bought it all.
[01:33:20.240 --> 01:33:21.240]   Unite bar us on your cameras once and once.
[01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:22.240]   Sure.
[01:33:22.240 --> 01:33:23.240]   Yeah.
[01:33:23.240 --> 01:33:26.120]   I've never-- I think I've been on Squarespace now.
[01:33:26.120 --> 01:33:27.120]   It's in Squarespace 5.
[01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:28.120]   It's in Squarespace 6.
[01:33:28.120 --> 01:33:31.000]   I've never, ever had a problem.
[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:33.320]   Everybody go to photographybegins.com right now.
[01:33:33.320 --> 01:33:34.320]   If all--
[01:33:34.320 --> 01:33:35.320]   Yeah.
[01:33:35.320 --> 01:33:36.320]   If you can't bring these sites down.
[01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:38.760]   5,000 of you watching right now, go there.
[01:33:38.760 --> 01:33:40.640]   You can't bring it around.
[01:33:40.640 --> 01:33:43.280]   You chose Squarespace because it's easy to build a website.
[01:33:43.280 --> 01:33:45.320]   It's affordable to build a website.
[01:33:45.320 --> 01:33:47.680]   You start with 20 beautiful templates.
[01:33:47.680 --> 01:33:51.760]   If you're doing-- if you want to say it looks great if you're a photographer, an artist,
[01:33:51.760 --> 01:33:55.680]   it's great for a portfolio because you want your site to be gorgeous.
[01:33:55.680 --> 01:33:58.360]   You want your site to express your aesthetic.
[01:33:58.360 --> 01:34:00.720]   But at the same time, you don't want to become a web developer.
[01:34:00.720 --> 01:34:02.440]   You don't want to learn JavaScript and CSS.
[01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:04.120]   Well, you don't have to.
[01:34:04.120 --> 01:34:08.960]   Squarespace gives you the tools you need to make your site gorgeous easily.
[01:34:08.960 --> 01:34:11.160]   And of course, it never goes down.
[01:34:11.160 --> 01:34:12.160]   That's a nice feature.
[01:34:12.160 --> 01:34:13.480]   You get hosting and software.
[01:34:13.480 --> 01:34:15.200]   They've got their new Squarespace metric app.
[01:34:15.200 --> 01:34:16.680]   I don't know if you've tried this yet, Clayton.
[01:34:16.680 --> 01:34:18.440]   It's iPhone and iPad ready.
[01:34:18.440 --> 01:34:22.360]   It lets you see the site stats in real time.
[01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:23.200]   Page views you--
[01:34:23.200 --> 01:34:24.200]   Yeah, I've used it recently.
[01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:25.200]   It's so cool.
[01:34:25.200 --> 01:34:29.280]   Site visitors, site unique visitors, social media follows.
[01:34:29.280 --> 01:34:31.080]   They've got a great blog app too.
[01:34:31.080 --> 01:34:32.880]   They got-- these guys are good.
[01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:35.680]   The code is for responsive design with the responsive design.
[01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:40.200]   I mean, you can look at your site traffic and the metrics and an overwhelming number
[01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:43.560]   of the folks that come to my site are coming from mobile.
[01:34:43.560 --> 01:34:46.240]   That's a really important thing to know.
[01:34:46.240 --> 01:34:47.400]   Yeah.
[01:34:47.400 --> 01:34:48.800]   And your site looks great on mobile.
[01:34:48.800 --> 01:34:52.840]   In fact, what's nice is it's not a mobile site of your site.
[01:34:52.840 --> 01:34:55.800]   Your site looks great on all Scry Size screens.
[01:34:55.800 --> 01:34:57.160]   And that's really what you want.
[01:34:57.160 --> 01:34:59.640]   You don't want to have a different site because you're on an iPhone.
[01:34:59.640 --> 01:35:02.320]   You want it to look great on all size screens.
[01:35:02.320 --> 01:35:03.320]   You can try it free.
[01:35:03.320 --> 01:35:04.320]   No credit card needed.

[01:35:09.240 --> 01:35:10.480]   They do have wonderful help.
[01:35:10.480 --> 01:35:11.280]   They have forums.
[01:35:11.280 --> 01:35:12.240]   They have webinars.
[01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:14.760]   They can-- you know, workshops to make you better at it.

[01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:19.120]   Their support comes from the Squarespace offices in New York.
[01:35:19.120 --> 01:35:20.160]   So it's really good.
[01:35:20.160 --> 01:35:23.240]   These are the engineers who actually do work on it.

[01:35:35.400 --> 01:35:37.200]   And you don't even need a credit card to try it.
[01:35:37.200 --> 01:35:39.120]   But if you decide to buy, get 10% off.
[01:35:39.120 --> 01:35:40.680]   And get that annual plan.
[01:35:40.680 --> 01:35:43.760]   As little as $8 a month, you get a free domain name.
[01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:44.800]   They've got e-commerce.
[01:35:44.800 --> 01:35:47.080]   I mean, I think anybody who watches this show
[01:35:47.080 --> 01:35:48.240]   knows we love Squarespace.
[01:35:48.240 --> 01:35:54.240]   squarespace.com offer code TWIT1.
[01:35:54.240 --> 01:35:55.640]   So Candy Crush Saga.
[01:35:55.640 --> 01:35:56.400]   Anybody play that?
[01:35:56.400 --> 01:36:01.520]   Why would you play it if they didn't do it for a while?
[01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:02.960]   Yeah.
[01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:05.920]   They've trademarked the word candy.
[01:36:05.920 --> 01:36:07.120]   Come on.
[01:36:07.120 --> 01:36:09.600]   Come on.
[01:36:09.600 --> 01:36:12.200]   They got the trademark.
[01:36:12.200 --> 01:36:15.720]   And they immediately started issuing takedown requests
[01:36:15.720 --> 01:36:19.000]   for any app that had the word candy in it.
[01:36:19.000 --> 01:36:20.600]   But apparently--
[01:36:20.600 --> 01:36:21.720]   You're asking for trouble.
[01:36:21.720 --> 01:36:25.280]   It's not even just apps.
[01:36:25.280 --> 01:36:28.440]   It defends against clone titles, which I think is legitimate.
[01:36:28.440 --> 01:36:30.000]   There's a lot of clone titles.
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:34.880]   But I think they got it even more broadly than just apps.
[01:36:34.880 --> 01:36:35.800]   So who knows?
[01:36:35.800 --> 01:36:36.880]   You may see--
[01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:38.480]   You may see a tweet last.
[01:36:38.480 --> 01:36:39.880]   Really?
[01:36:39.880 --> 01:36:41.880]   It seems like a generic word.
[01:36:41.880 --> 01:36:48.760]   Apple actually emitted the takedown request on Kings Bay
[01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:50.240]   half.
[01:36:50.240 --> 01:36:51.560]   I guess that's part of the mechanism
[01:36:51.560 --> 01:36:52.520]   if you have a trademark.
[01:36:52.520 --> 01:36:55.720]   All right.
[01:36:55.720 --> 01:36:57.200]   That's a fascinating story.
[01:36:57.200 --> 01:36:59.760]   Well, they're just going after apps.
[01:36:59.760 --> 01:37:00.960]   They're not going to go after.
[01:37:00.960 --> 01:37:02.280]   I hope so.
[01:37:02.280 --> 01:37:04.880]   I think it also covers pizza parlors, but I'm not wrong.
[01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:05.400]   I'm not sure.
[01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:07.920]   I think there's more to it than just apps.
[01:37:07.920 --> 01:37:09.640]   But you wouldn't want to name a pizza parlors.
[01:37:09.640 --> 01:37:12.440]   Did you see the guy we had a long debate on this week
[01:37:12.440 --> 01:37:16.680]   in Google about the guy who wore glass into a movie,
[01:37:16.680 --> 01:37:17.800]   an AMC movie theater.
[01:37:17.800 --> 01:37:21.080]   Now, in his defense, he has prescription glasses
[01:37:21.080 --> 01:37:23.160]   with Google Glass attached.
[01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:27.280]   In Columbus, Ohio, he's sitting there halfway through the movie.
[01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:29.640]   A guy flashes a badge at him, says, come with me--
[01:37:29.640 --> 01:37:33.400]   oh, grabs the glass, and says, come with me immediately.
[01:37:33.400 --> 01:37:36.160]   Turns out, it's the Department of Homeland Security.
[01:37:36.160 --> 01:37:37.480]   Yeah, that's weird.
[01:37:37.480 --> 01:37:39.040]   Well, I don't think so because I think
[01:37:39.040 --> 01:37:42.200]   the guy's, which is part of DHS,
[01:37:42.200 --> 01:37:46.000]   is the defense copyright and trademark and stuff like that.
[01:37:46.000 --> 01:37:48.400]   They're the copyright police now.
[01:37:48.400 --> 01:37:49.600]   Because--
[01:37:49.600 --> 01:37:51.080]   So they're working for the MP of LA, OK?
[01:37:51.080 --> 01:37:52.720]   It's a form of terrorism.
[01:37:52.720 --> 01:37:54.400]   Yeah, no, it is totally a form of terrorism.
[01:37:54.400 --> 01:37:56.360]   Then he says to the man wearing Google Glass,
[01:37:56.360 --> 01:37:58.400]   I can only record eight minutes at a time.
[01:37:58.400 --> 01:37:58.920]   Yeah.
[01:37:58.920 --> 01:38:02.440]   And then it craps out.
[01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:03.720]   He says, I tried to--
[01:38:03.720 --> 01:38:06.040]   I said, hook up the glass.
[01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:07.080]   Here, take the glass.
[01:38:07.080 --> 01:38:09.480]   They took his phone, they took his wallet.
[01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:12.000]   He said, look at what's on my phone, look at some of my wallet.
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:13.560]   It's just pictures of my dog and my wife.
[01:38:13.560 --> 01:38:15.560]   And what movie was it?
[01:38:15.560 --> 01:38:16.800]   Jack Ryan.
[01:38:16.800 --> 01:38:18.360]   Oh, yeah, everyone wants to record that.
[01:38:18.360 --> 01:38:20.840]   Shh, shadow recruit.
[01:38:20.840 --> 01:38:23.400]   He says, what following was over an hour of the feds telling me
[01:38:23.400 --> 01:38:24.360]   I'm not under arrest.
[01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:25.880]   This is a voluntary interview.
[01:38:25.880 --> 01:38:27.040]   But--
[01:38:27.040 --> 01:38:30.880]   If I choose not to cooperate, bad things may happen.
[01:38:30.880 --> 01:38:32.640]   It's kind of stretching if low end.
[01:38:32.640 --> 01:38:35.360]   Did they reimburse him for the cost of getting
[01:38:35.360 --> 01:38:37.000]   his butt yanked out of the movie?
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:38.480]   Well, yeah, time and money.
[01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:41.000]   They gave him four passes to a future film.
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:41.680]   Four.
[01:38:41.680 --> 01:38:42.120]   Yeah.
[01:38:42.120 --> 01:38:43.840]   For one-- OK, well, that seems reasonable.
[01:38:43.840 --> 01:38:45.080]   Seems fair.
[01:38:45.080 --> 01:38:46.560]   They didn't really want to look at what
[01:38:46.560 --> 01:38:47.600]   was on the phone on the glass.
[01:38:47.600 --> 01:38:48.280]   They questioned him.
[01:38:48.280 --> 01:38:49.360]   They didn't know how to do it.
[01:38:49.360 --> 01:38:51.600]   For an hour, wanting to know who I am, where I live,
[01:38:51.600 --> 01:38:52.920]   where I work, how much money I'm making,
[01:38:52.920 --> 01:38:55.280]   how many computers I have at home, why I'm recording the movie,
[01:38:55.280 --> 01:38:56.920]   who am I going to give the recording to,
[01:38:56.920 --> 01:38:59.800]   and why don't I just give up the guy up the chain
[01:38:59.800 --> 01:39:01.840]   because they're not interested in me?
[01:39:01.840 --> 01:39:05.400]   Should have said it was Janet Napolitano.
[01:39:05.400 --> 01:39:06.800]   Eventually after a long time--
[01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:10.680]   now, this is all the account of the perp.
[01:39:10.680 --> 01:39:12.720]   So we don't know.
[01:39:12.720 --> 01:39:13.520]   But eventually--
[01:39:13.520 --> 01:39:14.680]   Well, these guys are all--
[01:39:14.680 --> 01:39:15.160]   I believe it.
[01:39:15.160 --> 01:39:16.160]   I believe it.
[01:39:16.160 --> 01:39:16.680]   Eventually--
[01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:17.400]   He didn't do anything.
[01:39:17.400 --> 01:39:19.400]   And if that Clayton's right, he couldn't have recorded it
[01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:20.760]   with that thing anyway.
[01:39:20.760 --> 01:39:22.800]   Records like, you know, it craps out within a minute.
[01:39:22.800 --> 01:39:24.080]   But don't you think-- OK, well, this
[01:39:24.080 --> 01:39:25.320]   is the conversation we had on Twig.
[01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:27.360]   I said, yes, of course this is of a reaction.
[01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:30.200]   But the theater owner have every right to throw him out,
[01:39:30.200 --> 01:39:32.120]   just as they would if he were holding up a camcorder,
[01:39:32.120 --> 01:39:34.200]   or even his phone and recording.
[01:39:34.200 --> 01:39:35.280]   That's illegal.
[01:39:35.280 --> 01:39:36.480]   And--
[01:39:36.480 --> 01:39:38.680]   So you took the side of the government on this.
[01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:41.040]   I did, because frankly, if you're
[01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:42.640]   going to be a glass hole, you should
[01:39:42.640 --> 01:39:43.960]   expect this kind of treatment.
[01:39:43.960 --> 01:39:46.680]   Well, if it was scoble maybe.
[01:39:46.680 --> 01:39:48.280]   But except for that one in--
[01:39:48.280 --> 01:39:50.880]   I just don't think you should wear--
[01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:53.360]   if you're going to be on the cutting edge of this stuff,
[01:39:53.360 --> 01:39:54.960]   understand people's sensitivity.
[01:39:54.960 --> 01:39:55.960]   That's what sensitive--
[01:39:55.960 --> 01:39:57.000]   You can't be--
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:58.040]   You can't--
[01:39:58.040 --> 01:39:58.920]   Clayton said it.
[01:39:58.920 --> 01:40:01.440]   You can't record the movie anywhere with the device,
[01:40:01.440 --> 01:40:02.360]   because it just doesn't--
[01:40:02.360 --> 01:40:04.320]   it's not equipped to do that.
[01:40:04.320 --> 01:40:06.480]   And what kind of a record are you going to sell it?
[01:40:06.480 --> 01:40:08.280]   Say you could record the whole movie.
[01:40:08.280 --> 01:40:10.480]   Some crappy movie that's every time you turn around
[01:40:10.480 --> 01:40:13.000]   and look at somebody next to you, you get to see that.
[01:40:13.000 --> 01:40:13.960]   But we know that happens.
[01:40:13.960 --> 01:40:15.360]   People sell those.
[01:40:15.360 --> 01:40:18.040]   We hear the guys breathing in the background the whole time.
[01:40:18.040 --> 01:40:22.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:26.360]   These sorts of movies aren't sold that often.
[01:40:26.360 --> 01:40:29.880]   Anyway, you can always get the Academy screener.
[01:40:29.880 --> 01:40:31.440]   And what do you need that for, right?
[01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:33.000]   To sell that.
[01:40:33.000 --> 01:40:34.080]   Yeah, you can get this.
[01:40:34.080 --> 01:40:36.480]   It is a cream-- it is a cream remove.
[01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:36.960]   Right.
[01:40:36.960 --> 01:40:38.720]   I just feel like-- I feel like people who--
[01:40:38.720 --> 01:40:41.640]   do any of you have glassed, Tim, do you have glass?
[01:40:41.640 --> 01:40:42.640]   I had glass for a long time.
[01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:42.960]   Yeah.
[01:40:42.960 --> 01:40:44.840]   But I certainly made a point to never bringing
[01:40:44.840 --> 01:40:45.680]   into the movie theater.
[01:40:45.680 --> 01:40:47.680]   I also made sure that I took it off
[01:40:47.680 --> 01:40:49.640]   if I ever went into the men's room just to be--
[01:40:49.640 --> 01:40:49.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:51.760]   --to be cautious and be aware of those sorts of situations.
[01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:53.120]   I didn't want to be--
[01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:54.040]   I didn't want to create a scene.
[01:40:54.040 --> 01:40:55.400]   I didn't want to create any issues.
[01:40:55.400 --> 01:40:56.880]   The only time that I wore glass
[01:40:56.880 --> 01:40:58.080]   that I was a little bit unsure about
[01:40:58.080 --> 01:40:59.680]   was through airport security.
[01:40:59.680 --> 01:41:01.440]   But I actually wanted to see what the reaction would
[01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:02.800]   be through airport security.
[01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:04.960]   And actually, everybody was fine in that case.
[01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:07.520]   And I checked my rights before going in there.
[01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:09.320]   And I knew that I could do that legally.
[01:41:09.320 --> 01:41:11.480]   But certainly, going into a movie theater,
[01:41:11.480 --> 01:41:13.880]   I think, is asking for trouble, even if it is a prescription
[01:41:13.880 --> 01:41:14.920]   class.
[01:41:14.920 --> 01:41:17.960]   Yeah, I just think-- I think you don't want to be that guy.
[01:41:17.960 --> 01:41:21.120]   And I think what you did, Tim, is exactly how people who
[01:41:21.120 --> 01:41:22.760]   wear glass should treat it.
[01:41:22.760 --> 01:41:24.840]   It's understand it's new.
[01:41:24.840 --> 01:41:26.840]   And people are funny about it.
[01:41:26.840 --> 01:41:28.720]   And don't wear it into the men's room.
[01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:30.400]   Just because you know you can only
[01:41:30.400 --> 01:41:32.520]   tape five minutes of the movie doesn't let you off the hook.
[01:41:32.520 --> 01:41:35.160]   I think you'd go to the ladies room with him.
[01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:35.680]   Geez.
[01:41:35.680 --> 01:41:38.160]   I didn't try that either, just for the record.
[01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:38.960]   Just checking.
[01:41:38.960 --> 01:41:41.200]   Somebody in the chat room says, you know if it was Apple glass,
[01:41:41.200 --> 01:41:42.880]   Leo would be defending it.
[01:41:42.880 --> 01:41:44.040]   I believe that's true.
[01:41:44.040 --> 01:41:46.720]   Whoever said that is right on the money.
[01:41:46.720 --> 01:41:48.360]   And by the way, he used to get kicked right now.
[01:41:48.360 --> 01:41:52.200]   I'd be defending it if we're Apple.
[01:41:52.200 --> 01:41:54.920]   That's why the Macintosh is sitting on the table,
[01:41:54.920 --> 01:41:56.800]   because I'm having a lot of Apple.
[01:41:56.800 --> 01:41:59.960]   What bothers me is that you didn't bring the real Mac,
[01:41:59.960 --> 01:42:00.560]   the new one.
[01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:02.200]   And I've been itching to check one out.
[01:42:02.200 --> 01:42:04.080]   I haven't-- I too lazy to go to the Apple store.
[01:42:04.080 --> 01:42:05.840]   You already stole my 5D Mark II.
[01:42:05.840 --> 01:42:07.240]   Now you know my Mac Pro?
[01:42:07.240 --> 01:42:07.400]   No, I didn't.
[01:42:07.400 --> 01:42:09.000]   Sitting over there was left.
[01:42:09.000 --> 01:42:11.080]   But I know that it exists with all these lenses.
[01:42:11.080 --> 01:42:13.240]   If I need it, let me tell you something about the Mac Pro.
[01:42:13.240 --> 01:42:14.560]   I will borrow it.
[01:42:14.560 --> 01:42:15.960]   Let me tell you something about the Mac Pro.
[01:42:15.960 --> 01:42:17.200]   They get problems with it.
[01:42:17.200 --> 01:42:17.720]   I love it.
[01:42:17.720 --> 01:42:19.440]   It's gorgeous.
[01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:21.320]   It's obviously overpriced.
[01:42:21.320 --> 01:42:22.280]   You think so?
[01:42:22.280 --> 01:42:23.240]   I don't think so.
[01:42:23.240 --> 01:42:23.920]   Well, you know what?
[01:42:23.920 --> 01:42:27.560]   This Mac, this original Mac, cost the equivalent of almost $6,000
[01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:29.840]   in modern dollars.
[01:42:29.840 --> 01:42:30.400]   Yeah.
[01:42:30.400 --> 01:42:32.680]   So a $3,000 computer.
[01:42:32.680 --> 01:42:33.640]   It's cheap.
[01:42:33.640 --> 01:42:35.160]   They're giving it away.
[01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:38.600]   And I talked to somebody who's-- it restarts periodically.
[01:42:38.600 --> 01:42:39.200]   That's not good.
[01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:39.720]   What?
[01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:42.080]   Mine, the sound drops off.
[01:42:42.080 --> 01:42:43.440]   And then Bluetooth went away.
[01:42:43.440 --> 01:42:45.400]   I can't use my trackpad or wireless keyboard.
[01:42:45.400 --> 01:42:47.640]   I had a biowired keyboard because I just have no Bluetooth.
[01:42:47.640 --> 01:42:48.880]   I don't think these are hardware problems.
[01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:50.640]   I think it's Mavericks.
[01:42:50.640 --> 01:42:52.480]   Mavericks is known to have Corotty.
[01:42:52.480 --> 01:42:53.840]   Oh, you think it's the--
[01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:55.080]   So as Tim, but I can't tell.
[01:42:55.080 --> 01:42:56.360]   So I just feel like--
[01:42:56.360 --> 01:42:57.600]   I don't know for--
[01:42:57.600 --> 01:42:59.520]   Well, that's not a very good-- now there you go.
[01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:01.280]   That was a high recommendation.
[01:43:01.280 --> 01:43:05.160]   That was a great commentary based on what these people in the chat
[01:43:05.160 --> 01:43:05.480]   from--
[01:43:05.480 --> 01:43:06.440]   Apple in the chat from--
[01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:07.640]   Buy it so fast.
[01:43:07.640 --> 01:43:09.000]   No, you wouldn't.
[01:43:09.000 --> 01:43:12.440]   You know, I think you actually have a grudge against the company.
[01:43:12.440 --> 01:43:16.120]   I think this person in the chat room is completely off base.
[01:43:16.120 --> 01:43:16.960]   Because you--
[01:43:16.960 --> 01:43:18.560]   Don't dig at all for me, please.
[01:43:18.560 --> 01:43:19.080]   What?
[01:43:19.080 --> 01:43:19.640]   Please.
[01:43:19.640 --> 01:43:21.360]   I just beg of you.
[01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:22.120]   I just beg of you.
[01:43:22.120 --> 01:43:23.640]   Clayton, great to have you.
[01:43:23.640 --> 01:43:26.720]   For how much longer will the gluten book, why gluten-free
[01:43:26.720 --> 01:43:28.080]   be available on Amazon?
[01:43:28.080 --> 01:43:28.600]   Till midnight?
[01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:31.960]   I think about another few hours.
[01:43:31.960 --> 01:43:34.120]   And then, yeah, it's free for another few hours.
[01:43:34.120 --> 01:43:34.840]   So go and grab it.
[01:43:34.840 --> 01:43:36.600]   And so many people already have--
[01:43:36.600 --> 01:43:37.600]   who are watching Twit Live.
[01:43:37.600 --> 01:43:39.360]   So thank you so much to everyone who has.
[01:43:39.360 --> 01:43:40.680]   And ours has already written a review.
[01:43:40.680 --> 01:43:41.840]   You guys are very, very kind.
[01:43:41.840 --> 01:43:42.280]   Thank you so much.
[01:43:42.280 --> 01:43:42.760]   That is awesome.
[01:43:42.760 --> 01:43:46.240]   And you are now-- oh, see, they didn't update the rank.
[01:43:46.240 --> 01:43:46.720]   Yeah.
[01:43:46.720 --> 01:43:47.960]   It's called Why Gluten-Free.
[01:43:47.960 --> 01:43:50.320]   If you missed it, why gluten-free with a question mark?
[01:43:50.320 --> 01:43:53.840]   If everybody who's listening to the show now goes and gets it's free.
[01:43:53.840 --> 01:43:54.520]   Free.
[01:43:54.520 --> 01:43:57.200]   Free gluten-free.
[01:43:57.200 --> 01:43:58.120]   You would be number one.
[01:43:58.120 --> 01:43:59.800]   So let's everybody do that right now.
[01:43:59.800 --> 01:44:00.400]   Just grab it.
[01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:00.840]   Thank you very much.
[01:44:00.840 --> 01:44:01.560]   Just grab it.
[01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:02.200]   You don't have to--
[01:44:02.200 --> 01:44:02.960]   You don't have a Kindle.
[01:44:02.960 --> 01:44:04.000]   Who cares?
[01:44:04.000 --> 01:44:05.000]   Yeah.
[01:44:05.000 --> 01:44:05.360]   Yeah.
[01:44:05.360 --> 01:44:06.320]   I can lend you one.
[01:44:06.320 --> 01:44:08.120]   Just send it to Leo's seventh Kindle.
[01:44:08.120 --> 01:44:10.520]   And I'll-- you know, I'll put it on.
[01:44:10.520 --> 01:44:12.800]   Or my 38th Android phone.
[01:44:12.800 --> 01:44:14.520]   Tim Stevens at cnet.com.
[01:44:14.520 --> 01:44:15.400]   Great to have you.
[01:44:15.400 --> 01:44:17.520]   Tim, what's next for you?
[01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:19.760]   Next up for me, I think, is Mobile World Congress here
[01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:21.200]   in a couple of weeks on Barcelona.
[01:44:21.200 --> 01:44:22.400]   So kind of gearing up for that.
[01:44:22.400 --> 01:44:24.240]   And it's still kind of clearing out my inbox
[01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:27.520]   after doing CES and the Detroit-- oh, show back to back.
[01:44:27.520 --> 01:44:29.280]   So kind of full behind on some things.
[01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:31.120]   So getting caught up on that and getting ready for Barcelona
[01:44:31.120 --> 01:44:31.960]   and looking forward to it.
[01:44:31.960 --> 01:44:34.240]   I'm jealous you got to go to the auto show.
[01:44:34.240 --> 01:44:35.880]   Yeah, that's always-- it's always a lot of fun,
[01:44:35.880 --> 01:44:39.560]   but it's always exhausting because CES is a bit of a nightmare
[01:44:39.560 --> 01:44:40.280]   at times.
[01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:41.160]   And it's pretty exhausting.
[01:44:41.160 --> 01:44:42.120]   And you always get sick.
[01:44:42.120 --> 01:44:43.560]   And then to roll right into another show.
[01:44:43.560 --> 01:44:44.840]   And straight to the deep running.
[01:44:44.840 --> 01:44:46.000]   Wow.
[01:44:46.000 --> 01:44:47.320]   Yeah, especially when it's Detroit.
[01:44:47.320 --> 01:44:48.600]   And it's 20 below them.
[01:44:48.600 --> 01:44:52.920]   Did you see anything of great interest at the car show?
[01:44:52.920 --> 01:44:53.280]   Yeah.
[01:44:53.280 --> 01:44:53.800]   Yeah.
[01:44:53.800 --> 01:44:55.640]   The new F-150 with the aluminum body.
[01:44:55.640 --> 01:44:56.640]   It's pretty exciting.
[01:44:56.640 --> 01:44:58.560]   Going to be up to 700 pounds lighter than before, which
[01:44:58.560 --> 01:44:59.240]   is massive.
[01:44:59.240 --> 01:45:01.440]   The new Corvette Z06 looks quite nice.
[01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:04.880]   It's faster than the old ZR1, which was a bonkers car
[01:45:04.880 --> 01:45:05.600]   to begin with.
[01:45:05.600 --> 01:45:07.480]   So yeah, definitely a lot of cool stuff.
[01:45:07.480 --> 01:45:08.720]   It looks like the market is definitely
[01:45:08.720 --> 01:45:10.000]   picking up a lot of steam.
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:11.080]   There's a lot of great cars coming up.
[01:45:11.080 --> 01:45:12.920]   How about electric or hybrids?
[01:45:12.920 --> 01:45:15.600]   Are those really taken off?
[01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:18.360]   Well, we'll see how the BMW i3 does this year.
[01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:19.840]   They had a big presence at CES.
[01:45:19.840 --> 01:45:21.800]   There's going to be a very small car.
[01:45:21.800 --> 01:45:25.160]   I think it's going to be about $35,000 to start here in the US.
[01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:27.400]   Really nothing revolutionary in terms of technology,
[01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:29.200]   but certainly a nice looking car and it's a BMW.
[01:45:29.200 --> 01:45:32.200]   So it's got some brand value behind it.
[01:45:32.200 --> 01:45:34.240]   But Tesla's still the leader in that sector right now.
[01:45:34.240 --> 01:45:36.160]   I think they'll continue to be for another year or two,
[01:45:36.160 --> 01:45:37.480]   at least.
[01:45:37.480 --> 01:45:38.720]   Thank you, Tim, for being here.
[01:45:38.720 --> 01:45:41.080]   Thank you to John C. Devorek, no agenda show.com.
[01:45:41.080 --> 01:45:43.520]   Before you go, we should probably
[01:45:43.520 --> 01:45:47.200]   check to see if Mike Elgens in the back with a report on what's ahead.
[01:45:47.200 --> 01:45:48.000]   I don't see him.
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:48.320]   Mike.
[01:45:48.320 --> 01:45:50.560]   Silicon Valley Giants report earnings this week.
[01:45:50.560 --> 01:45:53.960]   Apple Monday, Yahoo Tuesday, Facebook Wednesday, and Google
[01:45:53.960 --> 01:45:54.960]   Thursday.
[01:45:54.960 --> 01:45:57.400]   Amazon also has an earnings report Thursday.
[01:45:57.400 --> 01:46:01.520]   Plus, the wearable computing technologies conference starts in Munich on Monday,
[01:46:01.520 --> 01:46:04.760]   and the 3D printer world expo begins Friday in Burbank.
[01:46:04.760 --> 01:46:05.560]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:06.080]   Thank you, Mike.
[01:46:06.080 --> 01:46:06.440]   Wait, wait.
[01:46:06.440 --> 01:46:07.360]   I can ask him a question.
[01:46:07.360 --> 01:46:08.200]   Go ahead.
[01:46:08.200 --> 01:46:09.320]   Mike, wait a minute.
[01:46:09.320 --> 01:46:11.080]   John wants to ask you something.
[01:46:11.080 --> 01:46:12.680]   Hey, Mike.
[01:46:12.680 --> 01:46:15.400]   Go ahead, John.
[01:46:15.400 --> 01:46:16.560]   That was Clayton.
[01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:18.800]   Clayton doing Mike's voice.
[01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:19.640]   Very good.
[01:46:19.640 --> 01:46:22.320]   Yes, John.
[01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:24.200]   And John, John, you had a question.
[01:46:24.200 --> 01:46:25.360]   Go ahead.
[01:46:25.360 --> 01:46:28.920]   There's anything you missed this week on Twitch.
[01:46:28.920 --> 01:46:30.640]   We've taken it all.
[01:46:30.640 --> 01:46:33.960]   We've rolled it up into a gluten-free ball.
[01:46:33.960 --> 01:46:34.600]   Wait a minute.
[01:46:34.600 --> 01:46:35.600]   And I'm going to--
[01:46:35.600 --> 01:46:37.360]   This is a house ad.
[01:46:37.360 --> 01:46:38.440]   Yes, it is.
[01:46:38.440 --> 01:46:41.360]   I'm going to lob it at you right now.
[01:46:41.360 --> 01:46:44.880]   Previously on Twitch, coding 101.
[01:46:44.880 --> 01:46:48.600]   For the next 30 minutes, we're going to teach you everything there is to know about
[01:46:48.600 --> 01:46:51.400]   the coast you are ready to be a code monkey.
[01:46:51.400 --> 01:46:52.360]   Windows Weekly.
[01:46:52.360 --> 01:46:58.240]   Stealth Marketing, Microsoft, paying YouTubers for Xbox One mentions.
[01:46:58.240 --> 01:47:02.840]   The issue here was basically that these video bloggers, they're supposed to disclose
[01:47:02.840 --> 01:47:05.080]   that they're being paid to promote a product.
[01:47:05.080 --> 01:47:06.320]   Tech News Tonight.
[01:47:06.320 --> 01:47:10.400]   A US general says that as the army shrinks over the coming decades,
[01:47:10.400 --> 01:47:13.240]   robot soldiers pick up the slap.
[01:47:13.240 --> 01:47:14.480]   Tech News Today.
[01:47:14.480 --> 01:47:17.880]   HP is promoting Windows 7, saying that the four-year-old OS is backed
[01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:19.080]   by popular demand.
[01:47:19.080 --> 01:47:23.080]   I think the question is, can you at this point declare Windows 8 a flop?
[01:47:23.080 --> 01:47:27.680]   This week in Google, if you really think that every man on Earth wants to shoot other
[01:47:27.680 --> 01:47:31.520]   men's junk, the only thing stopping them is they don't have a camera on their head.
[01:47:31.520 --> 01:47:33.080]   No, that's not what we're saying.
[01:47:33.080 --> 01:47:37.680]   If you go around with a tape recorder like this, people are going to take Umbridge and
[01:47:37.680 --> 01:47:38.680]   write your song.
[01:47:38.680 --> 01:47:39.680]   You're saying very fast.
[01:47:39.680 --> 01:47:40.840]   I have technology on it.
[01:47:40.840 --> 01:47:43.400]   Jesus, is this week in what I do?
[01:47:43.400 --> 01:47:44.400]   Twitch.
[01:47:44.400 --> 01:47:46.440]   For Justice.
[01:47:46.440 --> 01:47:48.440]   For Justice.
[01:47:48.440 --> 01:47:50.640]   Thank you.
[01:47:50.640 --> 01:47:51.640]   Have fun in Barcelona.
[01:47:51.640 --> 01:47:53.480]   I'm so jealous that you're going to get to go, Tim.
[01:47:53.480 --> 01:47:54.480]   Have a great time over there.
[01:47:54.480 --> 01:47:55.480]   Thanks very much.
[01:47:55.480 --> 01:47:57.480]   At Mobile World Congress, we'll be covering it as well.
[01:47:57.480 --> 01:47:59.320]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:47:59.320 --> 01:48:00.320]   We do tweet every Sunday afternoon at 3PM.
[01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:01.880]   I don't know what we're going to do.
[01:48:01.880 --> 01:48:03.560]   When is the Super Bowl next week?
[01:48:03.560 --> 01:48:04.560]   Are we going to...
[01:48:04.560 --> 01:48:06.760]   You don't watch football, do you?
[01:48:06.760 --> 01:48:07.760]   Never heard it.
[01:48:07.760 --> 01:48:09.480]   Why don't you come to the Super Bowl together?
[01:48:09.480 --> 01:48:10.480]   I think I'm busy.
[01:48:10.480 --> 01:48:11.480]   Is it like...
[01:48:11.480 --> 01:48:12.480]   Is it after the show, right?
[01:48:12.480 --> 01:48:13.480]   No.
[01:48:13.480 --> 01:48:14.480]   Is it going to be...
[01:48:14.480 --> 01:48:15.480]   Or maybe it's 3 o'clock.
[01:48:15.480 --> 01:48:18.200]   It's like 5.30, 6PM Eastern time.
[01:48:18.200 --> 01:48:19.200]   Oh, 6PM Eastern.
[01:48:19.200 --> 01:48:20.200]   That's 3 o'clock.
[01:48:20.200 --> 01:48:21.200]   Round the money.
[01:48:21.200 --> 01:48:22.200]   So you don't want to watch the Super Bowl.
[01:48:22.200 --> 01:48:23.200]   Watch the Twitter next week.
[01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:24.200]   Watch the Twitter next week.
[01:48:24.200 --> 01:48:25.200]   Watch the Twitter next week.
[01:48:25.200 --> 01:48:26.200]   Watch the Twitter next week.
[01:48:26.200 --> 01:48:27.200]   3PM Civic 6.
[01:48:27.200 --> 01:48:28.200]   Just take it off.
[01:48:28.200 --> 01:48:29.200]   Take it off.
[01:48:29.200 --> 01:48:30.200]   2200 UTC.
[01:48:30.200 --> 01:48:31.200]   Please watch the Twitter next week.
[01:48:31.200 --> 01:48:32.200]   The Super Bowl is going to be stupid.
[01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:36.120]   Luckily, it's a podcast that people can download and watch it later.
[01:48:36.120 --> 01:48:37.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:40.000]   If you don't watch live, you can always get it after the fact on Demand, versions, audio
[01:48:40.000 --> 01:48:41.560]   and video available at Twitter.
[01:48:41.560 --> 01:48:42.560]   Absolutely.
[01:48:42.560 --> 01:48:43.560]   What was I thinking?
[01:48:43.560 --> 01:48:44.560]   I don't know.
[01:48:44.560 --> 01:48:45.400]   You don't have to watch it.
[01:48:45.400 --> 01:48:47.160]   It's a game and we'll see you next week.
[01:48:47.160 --> 01:48:48.160]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:48:48.160 --> 01:48:49.160]   We'll see you next time.
[01:48:49.160 --> 01:48:50.160]   Amazing.
[01:48:50.160 --> 01:48:52.760]   Oh, another tweet is in the can.
[01:48:52.760 --> 01:48:58.160]   500 episodes and I still want to know that.
[01:48:58.160 --> 01:48:59.160]   Alright.
[01:48:59.160 --> 01:49:00.160]   Do it a tweet, baby.
[01:49:00.160 --> 01:49:01.160]   Do it a tweet.
[01:49:01.160 --> 01:49:02.160]   Alright.
[01:49:02.160 --> 01:49:03.160]   Do it a tweet, baby.
[01:49:03.160 --> 01:49:04.160]   Do it a tweet.
[01:49:04.160 --> 01:49:05.160]   Alright.
[01:49:05.160 --> 01:49:07.960]   Do it a tweet, baby.
[01:49:07.960 --> 01:49:09.360]   It's time for a tweet this week in Tech.
[01:49:09.360 --> 01:49:12.480]   Tim Stevens, John C. Devorak and Clayton Morris.
[01:49:12.480 --> 01:49:14.200]   Join us to talk about the weeks.
[01:49:14.200 --> 01:49:15.200]   Tech news.
[01:49:15.200 --> 01:49:16.200]   Lots to say.
[01:49:16.200 --> 01:49:17.200]   We're going to say it.
[01:49:17.200 --> 01:49:18.200]   Sorry.
[01:49:18.200 --> 01:49:19.200]   And we'll see you next week.
[01:49:19.200 --> 01:49:20.200]   Bye.
