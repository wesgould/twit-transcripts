[00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:04.300]   panelists on Twitter.
[00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:08.300]   In fact, I think this was the first time I met Brian Brushwood.
[00:02:08.300 --> 00:02:09.300]   I think Barretton was here.
[00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.300]   I think it was the second time.
[00:02:11.300 --> 00:02:12.300]   Second time.
[00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:14.300]   But you two seem to go together like soup and sandwich,
[00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.300]   like a fish in a bicycle.
[00:02:15.300 --> 00:02:16.300]   It's great to have you.
[00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.300]   Like a fish in a bicycle?
[00:02:17.300 --> 00:02:19.300]   Yeah, all the dibs on the soup.
[00:02:19.300 --> 00:02:20.300]   [laughter]
[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:23.300]   On the soup to my left, Mr. Brian Brushwood,
[00:02:23.300 --> 00:02:26.300]   of course, host of Game On, NSFW,

[00:02:29.300 --> 00:02:30.300]   Scam School.
[00:02:30.300 --> 00:02:32.300]   Scam School, of course, of course, of the thing there.
[00:02:32.300 --> 00:02:33.300]   Division 3, yeah.
[00:02:33.300 --> 00:02:34.300]   Also, BBC America.
[00:02:34.300 --> 00:02:35.300]   He hosts the whole thing now.
[00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:36.300]   That's right.
[00:02:36.300 --> 00:02:37.300]   I'm the BB in the TV show.
[00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:38.300]   [laughter]
[00:02:38.300 --> 00:02:39.300]   BBC.
[00:02:39.300 --> 00:02:40.300]   Brian, great to see you.
[00:02:40.300 --> 00:02:41.300]   Thank you for being here.
[00:02:41.300 --> 00:02:42.300]   He's going to be doing Game On a little later.
[00:02:42.300 --> 00:02:43.300]   Yes, absolutely.
[00:02:43.300 --> 00:02:44.300]   Despite doing the game.
[00:02:44.300 --> 00:02:45.300]   Just spied down in the game.
[00:02:45.300 --> 00:02:46.300]   Programming from NBC.
[00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:47.300]   I think you'll do it.
[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:51.300]   I think you're going to do a Madden version of the Super Bowl
[00:02:51.300 --> 00:02:53.300]   where you play country versus J.
[00:02:53.300 --> 00:02:54.300]   Bam!
[00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:57.300]   I understand that Sports Ball is a very popular game.
[00:02:57.300 --> 00:02:59.300]   I'm looking forward to checking it out myself.
[00:02:59.300 --> 00:03:01.300]   Actually, our British fans call it, say,
[00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:02.300]   "We already have football."
[00:03:02.300 --> 00:03:03.300]   That's hand egg.
[00:03:03.300 --> 00:03:04.300]   Dude, you're going to call it hand egg.
[00:03:04.300 --> 00:03:05.300]   There's no foot.
[00:03:05.300 --> 00:03:07.300]   You're carrying it, and it doesn't look like a ball.
[00:03:07.300 --> 00:03:08.300]   It looks like an egg.
[00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.300]   What are you nuts?
[00:03:10.300 --> 00:03:14.300]   That's Baratunde Thurston, who's brand new book is out,
[00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:16.300]   and that's why he's touring the world.
[00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.300]   Bam!
[00:03:17.300 --> 00:03:19.300]   Teaching the world how to be black.
[00:03:19.300 --> 00:03:20.300]   Hello.
[00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:21.300]   It's great to be back, Leo.
[00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.300]   It's really great to be back with Mr. Schwood.
[00:03:23.300 --> 00:03:24.300]   We got Schwood at two new versions.
[00:03:24.300 --> 00:03:26.300]   They are just on MSNBC.
[00:03:26.300 --> 00:03:27.300]   Yeah.
[00:03:27.300 --> 00:03:28.300]   NPR with Turnit.
[00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:29.300]   Gross.
[00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:30.300]   CNN.
[00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:31.300]   Hey, you're just making the...
[00:03:31.300 --> 00:03:32.300]   It's great.
[00:03:32.300 --> 00:03:33.300]   Permanent campaign.
[00:03:33.300 --> 00:03:35.300]   There's a lot of interest in this book.
[00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:36.300]   Yeah, people want to know about black stuff.
[00:03:36.300 --> 00:03:37.300]   I'm kind of mad at you, though.
[00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:38.300]   I wore a scarf.
[00:03:38.300 --> 00:03:39.300]   And you didn't.
[00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:40.300]   Yeah.
[00:03:40.300 --> 00:03:42.300]   But I am coordinated, my shoes.
[00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:43.300]   Oh, at least your shoes in that...
[00:03:43.300 --> 00:03:45.300]   And my arsenal jacket are matching.
[00:03:45.300 --> 00:03:46.300]   Go Gunners.
[00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:47.300]   Are you in a football?
[00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:48.300]   Look at that.
[00:03:48.300 --> 00:03:49.300]   That's awesome.
[00:03:49.300 --> 00:03:52.300]   I do have to point out that this is an orchestrated plan.
[00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:56.300]   This is genius, because in October you came out to one of my live shows in Manhattan.
[00:03:56.300 --> 00:03:57.300]   That's right.
[00:03:57.300 --> 00:03:59.300]   And you were just like, "Well, I got a plan.
[00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:02.300]   Number one, how to be black will come out in February, black history month."
[00:04:02.300 --> 00:04:05.300]   And then you set up a street team, you have all these lieutenants,
[00:04:05.300 --> 00:04:07.300]   who was setting all this stuff up for you.
[00:04:07.300 --> 00:04:09.300]   It is the most brilliantly orchestrated PR campaign.
[00:04:09.300 --> 00:04:11.300]   And the book is selling really well.
[00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:14.300]   Well, this will be a measure of, can you use social media, new media,
[00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:16.300]   to make a book take off?
[00:04:16.300 --> 00:04:17.300]   Yeah.
[00:04:17.300 --> 00:04:18.300]   You're using old media too.
[00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:19.300]   You're pulling all the edge.
[00:04:19.300 --> 00:04:20.300]   No, it's a good partnership.
[00:04:20.300 --> 00:04:21.300]   I mean, Harper is my publisher.
[00:04:21.300 --> 00:04:22.300]   They've been really good.
[00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.300]   And they've been good.
[00:04:23.300 --> 00:04:24.300]   They get it.
[00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:25.300]   They got me on fresh air.
[00:04:25.300 --> 00:04:27.300]   With Terry Gross, who was one of my heroes.
[00:04:27.300 --> 00:04:28.300]   And that's what they do.
[00:04:28.300 --> 00:04:29.300]   And so that was them.
[00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:31.300]   But then we also have a Tumblr campaign.
[00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:32.300]   Yes.
[00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.300]   Working with Tumblr.
[00:04:33.300 --> 00:04:34.300]   What's the Tumblr assign?
[00:04:34.300 --> 00:04:35.300]   How to be black.me.
[00:04:35.300 --> 00:04:38.300]   We redirected our domain to a Tumblr.
[00:04:38.300 --> 00:04:40.300]   And we're encouraging people to share their own stories.
[00:04:40.300 --> 00:04:42.300]   So you're partnering with them.
[00:04:42.300 --> 00:04:43.300]   Not officially.
[00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:44.300]   We talk to them.
[00:04:44.300 --> 00:04:45.300]   We say la hada.
[00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.300]   And they have a new partnership.
[00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.300]   I'm not a partnership.
[00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.300]   I guess initiative.
[00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:52.300]   They hired a woman named Rachel Ferschleja, who has a big history in books.
[00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:54.300]   And it's her job to kind of reach out to authors.
[00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:55.300]   So we talk to her.
[00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.300]   That's smart.
[00:04:56.300 --> 00:04:59.300]   Like how can you use Tumblr without just trying to sell the book?
[00:04:59.300 --> 00:05:01.300]   Can you help sell an idea, make a community?
[00:05:01.300 --> 00:05:05.100]   Well, and I think that's, it's a real testament to Baratunde that he gets social media because
[00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:07.300]   you can't astroturf this kind of thing.
[00:05:07.300 --> 00:05:11.300]   You have to have genuine love from the people who are part of your team.
[00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:12.300]   I hate everybody.
[00:05:12.300 --> 00:05:13.300]   Just for the record.
[00:05:13.300 --> 00:05:14.300]   Like there's no.
[00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.300]   But you can't, but you can't fake it.
[00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:17.300]   You can't.
[00:05:17.300 --> 00:05:18.300]   I think you're right.
[00:05:18.300 --> 00:05:19.300]   I think that's what Brian is saying.
[00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:24.300]   This has to be a legitimate campaign among people who already have a community.
[00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.300]   It can still be orchestrated.
[00:05:25.300 --> 00:05:27.300]   It's orchestrated, but it's built on substance.
[00:05:27.300 --> 00:05:29.300]   The house is built on substance.
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.300]   We had a great launch timing with black history month with a great title.
[00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.300]   You know, the cover works well.
[00:05:35.300 --> 00:05:37.300]   The early coverage was good.
[00:05:37.300 --> 00:05:39.300]   But people who've read it also actually like the book.
[00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.300]   That helps.
[00:05:40.300 --> 00:05:43.700]   And then the story, you know, the participation layer, even if you don't read the book, like
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.020]   just go to this website and see what people are saying.
[00:05:46.020 --> 00:05:47.020]   Right.
[00:05:47.020 --> 00:05:49.300]   It's really heartfelt, funny, cool stuff about identity.
[00:05:49.300 --> 00:05:51.300]   And it's like not just black people talking about it either.
[00:05:51.300 --> 00:05:54.300]   So, you know, the Ouch has a great idea in our chat room.
[00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.300]   He says, do an AMA and ask me anything on Reddit.
[00:05:57.300 --> 00:05:58.300]   Oh yeah.
[00:05:58.300 --> 00:05:59.300]   Have you not done that yet?
[00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:02.300]   I wanted to, I'm, that was, like, I always wanted to ask black people, you know, like.
[00:06:02.300 --> 00:06:06.500]   No, and then thing is on, on Brian Lehrer on WNYC last week, we did a version of that.
[00:06:06.500 --> 00:06:07.500]   It was kind of like a national black conference.
[00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:08.500]   I'm black.

[00:21:23.500 --> 00:21:24.500]   I'm not the first person to ask that.
[00:21:24.500 --> 00:21:25.500]   I'm not the first person to ask that.
[00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:26.500]   I'm not the first person to ask that.
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:27.500]   I'm not the first person to ask that.
[00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:34.500]   That's really what you're betting on.
[00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:35.500]   It's bigger than that.
[00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:35.500]   I think we said this last week is no question that they're getting to the end of the line
[00:21:35.500 --> 00:21:38.500]   on how many users they can have because we're running out of interviews.
[00:21:38.500 --> 00:21:39.500]   Sure.
[00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:44.500]   It's also the case that they've only scratched the surface of monetization.
[00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:51.500]   They have Mark Zuckerberg, I think very wisely, has pulled the reins back on monetization,
[00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:53.500]   has said minimal monetization.
[00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:55.500]   Don't junk it up.
[00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:57.500]   That's a hard thing to do.
[00:21:57.500 --> 00:21:58.500]   He's done it for eight years.
[00:21:58.500 --> 00:22:00.500]   He's held that horseback.
[00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:03.500]   Now, when they do the IPO, whoosh.
[00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:04.500]   Yeah!
[00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:08.500]   Not all of these are evil uses when it comes to the advertising.
[00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:09.500]   Think about it in terms of...
[00:22:09.500 --> 00:22:10.500]   I know.
[00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:11.500]   I love this idea of $118 per user.
[00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:14.500]   I wish I could delete this picture by son and his underwear.
[00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:20.500]   The $118 per user is a perfect idea because you hear the stories about Google AdWords,
[00:22:20.500 --> 00:22:24.500]   where people are paying upwards of $50 to $100 per click for certain key terms like cancer,
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:26.500]   or mesothelioma, or whatever.
[00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:30.500]   So imagine you complain that you just came down with mesothelioma, and then all of a sudden
[00:22:30.500 --> 00:22:32.500]   you get an ad from...
[00:22:32.500 --> 00:22:35.500]   There's going to be a legal firm out there that's going to pay $100 just for the one
[00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:38.500]   display ad of like, "Hey, do you want to sue?"
[00:22:38.500 --> 00:22:41.500]   I changed my relationship status to signal on here.
[00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:47.500]   You wouldn't believe the number of dating sites for men over 50 suddenly showed up in my
[00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:48.500]   screen.
[00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:50.500]   It really was kind of scary.
[00:22:50.500 --> 00:22:53.500]   The more I'm thinking about this, the more I'm thinking like a $118 per user.
[00:22:53.500 --> 00:22:55.500]   Doesn't even make it close.
[00:22:55.500 --> 00:22:57.500]   I think there's a massive value over the long term.
[00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:02.500]   There is a fun game, I would say sort of a social hacking experiment that a woman in
[00:23:02.500 --> 00:23:08.500]   Teresa Valdez Klein pulled off a while ago where she bought Facebook ads to basically
[00:23:08.500 --> 00:23:12.500]   counter the negative messaging that women were getting from Facebook ads.
[00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.500]   Why not these ads were like, "Do you think you're fat?
[00:23:14.500 --> 00:23:16.500]   Do you wish you were pretty weird?
[00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:18.500]   Are you lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely?"
[00:23:18.500 --> 00:23:19.500]   Silly fat.
[00:23:19.500 --> 00:23:24.500]   And so she would buy ads targeted at women saying, "You're beautiful the way you are.
[00:23:24.500 --> 00:23:26.500]   Don't worry about this and that."
[00:23:26.500 --> 00:23:29.500]   And Teresa Valdez Klein, it's worth Googling.
[00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:32.500]   I'll see if we can dig up the link at some point maybe during one of the breaks and at
[00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:33.500]   least post it to the chat room.
[00:23:33.500 --> 00:23:38.500]   But it was a great way of kind of using their ad system which actually leans on some of the
[00:23:38.500 --> 00:23:43.500]   stereotypes and bad messaging and sort of more obvious ways to lure people.
[00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:46.500]   And she said, "Let's play it a little smarter and a little more fun.
[00:23:46.500 --> 00:23:47.500]   I wish I'd come up with it myself."
[00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:48.500]   It's brilliant.
[00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:51.500]   So what she did was she gave an ignite talk about it.
[00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:52.500]   That's such an internet way to handle things.
[00:23:52.500 --> 00:23:53.500]   No, it is.
[00:23:53.500 --> 00:23:55.500]   It's a nerdy, like nerd activism.
[00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:56.500]   You know, it's funny though.
[00:23:56.500 --> 00:23:59.500]   So I've gone to Teresa's Facebook timeline.
[00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:01.500]   And what ads do I see?
[00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:03.500]   Do you like beautiful women?
[00:24:03.500 --> 00:24:05.500]   You pick the profiles of pretty women.
[00:24:05.500 --> 00:24:07.500]   Mature American women.
[00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:08.500]   Senior people meet.
[00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:12.500]   You're like, "Oh, man, forever are going to be seniorpeoplemeet.com."
[00:24:12.500 --> 00:24:17.500]   For some reason, I want to think of it as like, "See your people to meet."
[00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:18.500]   Let's have some whiskey now.
[00:24:18.500 --> 00:24:19.500]   I brought some bourbon out.
[00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:22.500]   This is Blanton's Kentucky Straight.
[00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:23.500]   I got your bullet.
[00:24:23.500 --> 00:24:26.500]   This is the small batch bullet '95 rye we had last time we were doing.
[00:24:26.500 --> 00:24:29.500]   But I think you're a Glen going, "I don't have any McCallen.
[00:24:29.500 --> 00:24:30.500]   I know you like the McCallen."
[00:24:30.500 --> 00:24:32.500]   And look at these glasses, by the way.
[00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:35.500]   The RCA, these are nipper glasses.
[00:24:35.500 --> 00:24:36.500]   Which would you prefer there?
[00:24:36.500 --> 00:24:37.500]   I'll let you pour your own.
[00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:38.500]   Oh my goodness.
[00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:40.500]   You'd be your own bartender while we take a break.
[00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:44.500]   Let's get fauxronica out here because we're going to do an ice.com.
[00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:46.500]   By the way, the video is called "Subvertising."
[00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:48.500]   It's a search YouTube for it.
[00:24:48.500 --> 00:24:49.500]   I'll do it.
[00:24:49.500 --> 00:24:50.500]   In fact, we'll find it and play it.
[00:24:50.500 --> 00:24:53.500]   It's an Ignite talk, "The Art of Subvertising on Facebook."
[00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:54.500]   Don't you love Ignite?
[00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:55.500]   Have you done Ignite talks?
[00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:56.500]   Yeah, you've done two Ignite talks.
[00:24:56.500 --> 00:24:59.500]   So you get how many slides?
[00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:01.500]   There's 20 slides, 15 seconds each.
[00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:04.500]   So you get a total of five minutes.
[00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:06.500]   The slides are auto-advanced.
[00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:07.500]   Oh, that's great.
[00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:08.500]   You've never done this?
[00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:09.500]   No.
[00:25:09.500 --> 00:25:12.500]   This is the Twitter of TEDx presentation.
[00:25:12.500 --> 00:25:14.500]   There's so much that time you can do.
[00:25:14.500 --> 00:25:16.500]   The timing is really important.
[00:25:16.500 --> 00:25:18.500]   You can learn amazing things.
[00:25:18.500 --> 00:25:24.500]   I saw someone talk about social networking within.gov and about how the FBI and all these firms are trying to do it.
[00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:25.500]   It's brilliant.
[00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:29.500]   Hillary Mason at Bitly, their chief scientist, gave a really fantastic talk.
[00:25:29.500 --> 00:25:30.500]   Love them.
[00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:31.500]   Just smart, smart, awesome.
[00:25:31.500 --> 00:25:32.500]   I think Ignite is good.
[00:25:32.500 --> 00:25:35.500]   If you ever get a chance to go to Ignite a present, because they move fast.
[00:25:35.500 --> 00:25:37.500]   Well, they're part of a lot of existing conferences.
[00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:39.500]   They're sort of licensed around the world.
[00:25:39.500 --> 00:25:40.500]   They happen in Austin, I'm sure.
[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:41.500]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:41.500 --> 00:25:42.500]   Ignite Austin.
[00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:43.500]   I'm never in Austin.
[00:25:43.500 --> 00:25:44.500]   I'll make sure to take it out.
[00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:45.500]   I'll tell your family to go.
[00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:46.500]   Yeah.
[00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:47.500]   So it's time to talk a little bit about ICE.
[00:25:47.500 --> 00:25:51.500]   And we've got Philronica here, who is our ICE model.
[00:25:51.500 --> 00:25:54.500]   Actually, we have the real Veronica.
[00:25:54.500 --> 00:25:56.500]   So let me talk a little bit about what ICE is.
[00:25:56.500 --> 00:25:59.500]   ICE, as we mentioned it before, it's our jewelry store.
[00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:10.500]   And they know that the best way to get new customers is to go to Geeks, mostly guys, who have no idea what they're going to do for Valentine's Day.
[00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:11.500]   Can I help you?
[00:26:11.500 --> 00:26:12.500]   Can I help you?
[00:26:12.500 --> 00:26:18.900]   Your path to a successful Valentine's Day this year begins with a special Twit offer from
[00:26:18.900 --> 00:26:20.500]   ICE.com.

[00:26:32.500 --> 00:26:35.700]   Now, Veronica, do you have the ICE?
[00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:37.500]   I don't have the ICE.
[00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:40.500]   Almost perfectly exhumed.
[00:26:40.500 --> 00:26:41.500]   She's so good.
[00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:42.500]   She said close.
[00:26:42.500 --> 00:26:43.500]   I don't have the ICE.
[00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:45.500]   So she's going to go get the ICE.
[00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:46.500]   It's such a good deal to boost all the ICE.
[00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:49.500]   There's a ton of wonderful stuff here.
[00:26:49.500 --> 00:26:50.500]   And we're going to help you in a little bit.

[00:26:55.500 --> 00:26:59.500]   30% off when you go to ICE.com/Twit.
[00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:00.500]   And they have a great guy.
[00:27:00.500 --> 00:27:06.500]   And by the way, shop for her or if you want to know what women really want, shop for me.
[00:27:06.500 --> 00:27:10.500]   You go there and your gal can set up what she wants.
[00:27:10.500 --> 00:27:11.500]   Oh, she can make a wireless.
[00:27:11.500 --> 00:27:13.500]   That's what I always do.
[00:27:13.500 --> 00:27:14.500]   Do you have it there?
[00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:15.500]   All right.
[00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:18.500]   Lisa, my gal's going to bring in some ICE here.
[00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:19.500]   Look at this.
[00:27:19.500 --> 00:27:20.500]   That's my favorite.
[00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:21.500]   This is your favorite?
[00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:24.500]   Tell me about this, Lisa, because we've got to know what we're looking at here.
[00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:25.500]   By the way, she's silly.
[00:27:25.500 --> 00:27:26.500]   She's wearing a 49er shirt.
[00:27:26.500 --> 00:27:27.500]   You know it's over for them.
[00:27:27.500 --> 00:27:29.500]   I do, but I don't have any.
[00:27:29.500 --> 00:27:30.500]   Can't you dream?
[00:27:30.500 --> 00:27:31.500]   Can't you dream?
[00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:32.500]   You're a Giants fan, I'm guessing.
[00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:33.500]   For this game, yes.
[00:27:33.500 --> 00:27:37.500]   What a Giants fan for this game, but I know it's higher.
[00:27:37.500 --> 00:27:38.500]   So look at this.
[00:27:38.500 --> 00:27:40.500]   Do we have the information on this?
[00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:41.500]   That's shiny.
[00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:43.500]   Okay, here it is.
[00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:46.500]   So this is the real-time average half-carat diamond.
[00:27:46.500 --> 00:27:47.500]   Put your head there.
[00:27:47.500 --> 00:27:49.500]   Don't get your head in the shot yet.
[00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:51.500]   This is the half-carat 10k.
[00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:53.500]   Don't get the booze in the shot either.
[00:27:53.500 --> 00:27:56.500]   White gold heart pendant with chain.
[00:27:56.500 --> 00:28:00.500]   $595 with a Twit Valentine's Day price.
[00:28:00.500 --> 00:28:03.500]   $416, that's beautiful, isn't it?
[00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:05.500]   And a heart is so romantic.
[00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:07.500]   People love it when you give them a heart.
[00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:08.500]   All right, you want a little color?
[00:28:08.500 --> 00:28:09.500]   How about this?
[00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:13.500]   This is a white and blue sapphire sterling silver bracelet.
[00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:14.500]   That is just gorgeous.
[00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:16.500]   It's already very affordable.
[00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:18.500]   $195, you add the Twit discount.
[00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:19.500]   $136.
[00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:20.500]   Well, this is different.
[00:28:20.500 --> 00:28:23.500]   This is an amethyst and blue toe pass white gold.
[00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:25.500]   Actually, they just sent us this to play with.
[00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:26.500]   Look at that.
[00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:27.500]   Give me your hand.
[00:28:27.500 --> 00:28:28.500]   Give me your hand.
[00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:29.500]   Put that on.
[00:28:29.500 --> 00:28:30.500]   We're asking me for a second.
[00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:31.500]   Look at that.
[00:28:31.500 --> 00:28:32.500]   Get uncomfortable.
[00:28:32.500 --> 00:28:33.500]   Get your hand out.
[00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:34.500]   Here you go.
[00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:35.500]   That is pretty.
[00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:36.500]   That is gorgeous.
[00:28:36.500 --> 00:28:38.500]   Keep that on because they didn't apparently send that to us.
[00:28:38.500 --> 00:28:39.500]   They did.
[00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:40.500]   They never arrived.
[00:28:40.500 --> 00:28:41.500]   They did never arrive.
[00:28:41.500 --> 00:28:43.500]   She doesn't get it, does she?
[00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:44.500]   They never--
[00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:45.500]   He is stealing the jewel.
[00:28:45.500 --> 00:28:46.500]   Arrived.
[00:28:46.500 --> 00:28:48.500]   And gifting it to you.
[00:28:48.500 --> 00:28:53.500]   Anyway, it never arrived.
[00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:58.500]   Ice.com/Twit actually at these prices.
[00:28:58.500 --> 00:28:59.500]   It's amazing.
[00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:01.500]   30% off, sight wide, free shipping.
[00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:05.900]   Guys, you've got till February 10th to make sure that it comes in times for Valentine's
[00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:06.900]   time.
[00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:07.900]   It's take you time.
[00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:08.900]   February 9th.
[00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:09.900]   Freak out.
[00:29:09.900 --> 00:29:10.900]   Maybe you do it anyway.
[00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:11.900]   That's how I do it.
[00:29:11.900 --> 00:29:12.900]   I always wait for the last.
[00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:13.900]   Thank you, sir.
[00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:14.900]   Very well.
[00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:15.900]   Enjoy.
[00:29:15.900 --> 00:29:16.900]   Do I get some?
[00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:17.900]   What do we have in today?
[00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:18.900]   For my money.
[00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:19.900]   But somebody put the cork in there.
[00:29:19.900 --> 00:29:20.900]   I have a one that is not corked if you want.
[00:29:20.900 --> 00:29:21.900]   It's already poured in.
[00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:22.900]   It's okay.
[00:29:22.900 --> 00:29:23.900]   Is it okay?
[00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:24.900]   Yeah.
[00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:25.900]   It doesn't taste like--
[00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:26.900]   I'm a whiskey stronger than cork.
[00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:27.900]   I don't have--
[00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:28.400]   Yes, it is.
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:29.400]   That's all right.
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:30.400]   I know you're a McAllen fan.
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:31.400]   It's all right.
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:32.400]   It's all right.
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:33.400]   Thank you.
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:37.620]   So is it just me or-- like whenever I know I'm going to be on Twit, I read the tech news
[00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:38.620]   every single day.
[00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:39.780]   I'm like, come on big story.
[00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:40.780]   Come on.
[00:29:40.780 --> 00:29:41.780]   I find apples.
[00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:42.780]   It's kind of slow right now.
[00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:45.820]   And it's like-- I guess really Facebook is the biggest story.
[00:29:45.820 --> 00:29:48.080]   And it's like-- I mean, I guess we'll just wait and see.
[00:29:48.080 --> 00:29:51.460]   Did you read Nick Bilton's great article in the Times about this IPO?
[00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:56.140]   For instance, Sheryl Sandberg, C-O-O, but she didn't join-- she already was worth almost
[00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:57.660]   half a billion from Google.
[00:29:57.660 --> 00:30:00.440]   But she didn't join Facebook a couple of years ago.
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:05.600]   Her stock worth at $100 billion valuation, about $38 million.
[00:30:05.600 --> 00:30:06.600]   Wow.
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:07.600]   But wait.
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:08.600]   There's more.
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:09.600]   You know what I'm going with this.
[00:30:09.600 --> 00:30:11.840]   I don't, but I just like to say there's more.
[00:30:11.840 --> 00:30:15.680]   In the early days of Facebook, they had a guy come in to paint the wall, graffiti artist.
[00:30:15.680 --> 00:30:16.680]   Oh, this is a great story.
[00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:17.680]   They couldn't give him cash.
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:19.440]   They said, would you take a little paper?
[00:30:19.440 --> 00:30:20.440]   Yeah.
[00:30:20.440 --> 00:30:26.920]   His stock for one wall, $200 million.
[00:30:26.920 --> 00:30:29.060]   But here's the deal, guys.
[00:30:29.060 --> 00:30:30.540]   It was a wall.
[00:30:30.540 --> 00:30:33.260]   And we all know Facebook is predicated on the wall.
[00:30:33.260 --> 00:30:34.260]   The wall.
[00:30:34.260 --> 00:30:36.340]   So I think there's a little more symbolism going on there.
[00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:39.500]   Okay, but this is one of those things where I have an emotional short circuit.
[00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:44.100]   I can't decide if I'm angry that somebody's getting $200 million for any wall, or if I'm
[00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:45.100]   happy.
[00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:46.100]   Yeah.
[00:30:46.100 --> 00:30:47.340]   If I were a sucker, I might be a little angry.
[00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:53.740]   Now, he has-- his stock is worth-- he's got, I think, 38% of the value.
[00:30:53.740 --> 00:30:54.740]   28.
[00:30:54.740 --> 00:30:55.740]   28?
[00:30:55.740 --> 00:30:56.740]   Yeah.
[00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:57.740]   That's $200 billion.
[00:30:57.740 --> 00:30:58.740]   Right.
[00:30:58.740 --> 00:31:02.920]   At-- by the way, at the going off price, it could be worth the following day, three, four,
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:03.920]   five, ten times.
[00:31:03.920 --> 00:31:05.760]   But I want to go back to this idea of the painter.
[00:31:05.760 --> 00:31:09.580]   You just reminded me of someone I met last week, and I'll try to dig it out again.
[00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:14.120]   My mind's a little slow on the name, but the idea was they're trying to encourage entrepreneurs
[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:16.760]   to give 1% of their equity.
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:17.760]   It's like 1% of nothing.
[00:31:17.760 --> 00:31:18.760]   That's a great idea.
[00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:20.520]   You get to-- two charities of their choice.
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:21.520]   That's a wonderful idea.
[00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:26.440]   And so there's a guy from Boulder whose company did really well, and he was able to finance.
[00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:27.440]   You know, they-- he thought like, "Sure."
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:28.440]   They didn't even know what it meant.
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:30.780]   Sure, we'll accept your worthless stock paper.
[00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:31.780]   Oh, that's brilliant.
[00:31:31.780 --> 00:31:35.740]   He had an exit from his company, and they got 1% of a big number.
[00:31:35.740 --> 00:31:40.020]   And it changed that nonprofit's ability to affect the community.
[00:31:40.020 --> 00:31:41.940]   And he never felt the pinch.
[00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:43.180]   No, 1% of nothing.
[00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:44.180]   Yeah, sure.
[00:31:44.180 --> 00:31:45.180]   Right?
[00:31:45.180 --> 00:31:47.580]   So if you do well, then it's great if you don't, then it's nothing.
[00:31:47.580 --> 00:31:48.580]   That's awesome.
[00:31:48.580 --> 00:31:51.500]   And so the idea that this artist got a little percent of--
[00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:52.740]   It's not unusual, actually.
[00:31:52.740 --> 00:31:54.380]   I know there's a beautiful thing.
[00:31:54.380 --> 00:32:00.740]   A PR firm in San Francisco called the antenna group that during the dot com boom was taking
[00:32:00.740 --> 00:32:03.960]   stock in lieu of payment for her PR services.
[00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:05.860]   She's done quite well, as you might imagine.
[00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:07.900]   I think that's not a bad way to go.
[00:32:07.900 --> 00:32:13.040]   How many millionaires do we know will be-- will emerge from this IPO?
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:14.040]   Many.
[00:32:14.040 --> 00:32:15.040]   I mean, I don't know them.
[00:32:15.040 --> 00:32:16.040]   Remember the--
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:17.040]   When you said we--
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:19.780]   Remember the masseuse at Google, who was hired in the early days of Google?
[00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:21.220]   Ah, Matt Gallagher.
[00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:23.120]   Was worth, I think, several hundred million.
[00:32:23.120 --> 00:32:24.120]   I mean--
[00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:27.560]   We heard those-- I remember, you know, I guess it's a familiar tale by now.
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:32.120]   When I first got my start at Dell, it was during Dell's New York rise.
[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:36.200]   And they were talking about how, like, they wouldn't say you ought to buy as much as you
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:38.040]   can of the employee stock purchase program.
[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:39.040]   Mm-hmm.
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:40.040]   Let me put it this way.
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:41.440]   My secretary's worth $2 million.
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:42.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:43.680]   Her name is Bonnie Brown.
[00:32:43.680 --> 00:32:48.440]   She was a part-time massage therapist at Google.
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:53.980]   When there were 40 employees, she was offered a part-time job, $450 a week, but it included
[00:32:53.980 --> 00:32:54.980]   stock options.
[00:32:54.980 --> 00:32:55.980]   Yeah.
[00:32:55.980 --> 00:33:02.160]   She's now worth many, many millions of dollars and has a 3,000-square-foot house, gets her
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:05.360]   own massages once a week, has a private pilates instructor.
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:08.620]   No, it dramatically changes what you can do.
[00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:11.420]   And so if you can take some of this explosive growth--
[00:33:11.420 --> 00:33:13.220]   Because this is the exciting part of our time.
[00:33:13.220 --> 00:33:14.220]   I think I would do it.
[00:33:14.220 --> 00:33:15.220]   This is--
[00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:16.220]   Innovation's happening here.
[00:33:16.220 --> 00:33:17.220]   Yeah.
[00:33:17.220 --> 00:33:18.220]   Talent's being recruited here.
[00:33:18.220 --> 00:33:19.220]   The big hockey stick in growth is here.
[00:33:19.220 --> 00:33:22.380]   You throw people who wouldn't have access to this behind that by giving them a little
[00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:24.380]   piece of organizations behind that.
[00:33:24.380 --> 00:33:28.300]   Don't you think this is going to threaten, though, the success of Facebook?
[00:33:28.300 --> 00:33:29.300]   Because--
[00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:30.300]   What's going to threaten the success of Facebook?
[00:33:30.300 --> 00:33:31.300]   Well, stories like this?
[00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:32.300]   No, no, no, I just--
[00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:33.300]   Helping people?
[00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:34.300]   A couple of things.
[00:33:34.300 --> 00:33:35.300]   Yeah.
[00:33:35.300 --> 00:33:36.300]   Remember Steve Jobs?
[00:33:36.300 --> 00:33:37.780]   Steve Jobs-- actually, it was Bill Gates, I think, for a long time.
[00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:38.780]   Yeah.
[00:33:38.780 --> 00:33:42.220]   He did not want Microsoft to go public because he was very afraid that their employees would
[00:33:42.220 --> 00:33:43.220]   who all had options--
[00:33:43.220 --> 00:33:45.180]   It changes their incentives.
[00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:47.540]   They would-- and you see this happen in startups.
[00:33:47.540 --> 00:33:50.780]   They've got little apps that sit on their desktop and they're watching their value all
[00:33:50.780 --> 00:33:54.820]   the time, not coding, not sticking to business with the watch in their value.
[00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:59.260]   I don't think you can separate that because the passion with which so many people worked
[00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:02.940]   so long in this was predicated on an eventual exit.
[00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:04.900]   So it's not like this is actually a change.
[00:34:04.900 --> 00:34:07.220]   This was the guarantee that they were counting on the promise.
[00:34:07.220 --> 00:34:08.220]   That was the promise.
[00:34:08.220 --> 00:34:09.220]   That was the promise.
[00:34:09.220 --> 00:34:10.220]   You have to do this.
[00:34:10.220 --> 00:34:12.860]   We've still slaved away for the possibility of making nothing-- for the likelihood of making
[00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:13.860]   nothing--
[00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:14.860]   That guy.
[00:34:14.860 --> 00:34:18.460]   He worked on that wall for days.
[00:34:18.460 --> 00:34:19.460]   Days.
[00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:20.460]   Knowing.
[00:34:20.460 --> 00:34:23.140]   That organization is called 1% of nothing.
[00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:24.140]   And the guy was thinking of the Mac.
[00:34:24.140 --> 00:34:25.140]   I love that guy.
[00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:26.140]   Galigan who did Simple Geo.
[00:34:26.140 --> 00:34:27.140]   I love that guy.
[00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:29.700]   So when they got acquired, this bolder, non-profit made its own money.
[00:34:29.700 --> 00:34:33.300]   So in this story right now, we know obviously why Facebook is going public.
[00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:36.500]   It makes perfect sense and everyone wants their payday for all the hard work they put
[00:34:36.500 --> 00:34:38.780]   in for the last eight, nine years.
[00:34:38.780 --> 00:34:43.540]   But there is also-- there are other stories of very successful companies that get on the
[00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:46.100]   edge of filing an IPO and decide it's not worth it.
[00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:50.860]   For example, a friend of mine is an engineer over at SaaS in North Carolina.
[00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:56.340]   And they went through all the preparations and figured out once we stop owning everything,
[00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:59.980]   we can't spoil our employees with these treats.
[00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:02.860]   Because when you have to answer to a board, they're like, "Why are you-- why did you give
[00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:05.820]   everyone a $10,000 gift for X, Y, and Z?"
[00:35:05.820 --> 00:35:09.500]   So it'll be interesting to see-- and of course, none of us are on the inside-- but it'll be
[00:35:09.500 --> 00:35:13.860]   interesting to see how the corporate culture changes inside of Facebook post IPO.
[00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:14.860]   Yeah.
[00:35:14.860 --> 00:35:15.860]   We'll watch it.
[00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:16.860]   We'll watch from the outside.
[00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:20.060]   Me and Barrett do a day behind the hedge.
[00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:21.060]   Anything different?
[00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:22.060]   I don't know.
[00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:23.060]   So--
[00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:24.220]   I also think Mark's going to lose some control.
[00:35:24.220 --> 00:35:26.220]   And I think that that might be bad for Facebook.
[00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:30.060]   I think Mark has had so much control up to now.
[00:35:30.060 --> 00:35:37.220]   I worry a little bit about a Facebook that is a little bit more traditional in its structure.
[00:35:37.220 --> 00:35:40.260]   He still has-- majority, he has three out of five board seats.
[00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:42.460]   He has a 60% of voting shares.
[00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:44.460]   So he still has absolute control.
[00:35:44.460 --> 00:35:45.460]   But things change.
[00:35:45.460 --> 00:35:46.460]   Things change.
[00:35:46.460 --> 00:35:49.100]   We'll just have to wait and see.
[00:35:49.100 --> 00:35:55.300]   Laurie Andrews writing in the New York Times yesterday, "Facebook is using you."
[00:35:55.300 --> 00:35:56.300]   Yeah, of course.
[00:35:56.300 --> 00:35:57.300]   That's the premise.
[00:35:57.300 --> 00:35:58.300]   That's the premise.
[00:35:58.300 --> 00:35:59.300]   Newsflash.
[00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:01.300]   Also, the sky is blue.
[00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:02.300]   What's our-- I mean, she obviously has more--
[00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:03.300]   Hopefully, obviously has more--
[00:36:03.300 --> 00:36:05.100]   It's just Dan, what's up with gas prices?
[00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:06.100]   With Facebook.
[00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:07.100]   With behind the headline.
[00:36:07.100 --> 00:36:10.740]   Makes money by selling ad space to companies that want to reach us.
[00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:12.220]   Scandalous.
[00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:13.860]   If you indicate you like cupcakes--
[00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:14.860]   Yeah.
[00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:19.020]   --they live in a certain neighborhood and they've invited friends over, expect an ad from a nearby
[00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:20.020]   bakery.
[00:36:20.020 --> 00:36:21.700]   Can I-- I'm going to try to use this.
[00:36:21.700 --> 00:36:24.540]   You let me know if this is not cool as an opportunity to jump to a related story.
[00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:25.540]   Please do.
[00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:26.540]   And that's Google and privacy.
[00:36:26.540 --> 00:36:27.540]   Yeah.
[00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:28.540]   Well, it's the same story.
[00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:29.540]   It's exactly the same story.
[00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:30.540]   It's the same story.
[00:36:30.540 --> 00:36:31.540]   It's the same story.
[00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:35.980]   User behavior to ad targeting and the rights and responsibilities that we have.
[00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:36.980]   So think about this.
[00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:41.780]   And this-- I expect this to be some story that'll break in the next five years, just as a prediction.
[00:36:41.780 --> 00:36:44.260]   Remember this moment, everyone, because I'm reading in the plex and I'm reading about the
[00:36:44.260 --> 00:36:45.860]   way Google handles stuff.
[00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:50.500]   Without understanding a language, it knows what words are associated with certain things
[00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:55.340]   and is able to predict what you mean in Norwegian through translation software.
[00:36:55.340 --> 00:37:00.980]   For example, on Facebook, there could be a type of situation where they start to see
[00:37:00.980 --> 00:37:04.460]   the things that are associated with having an affair or something like that, where all
[00:37:04.460 --> 00:37:05.860]   of a sudden, you never say anything.
[00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:06.860]   Yeah.
[00:37:06.860 --> 00:37:07.860]   But they-- but they know.
[00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:08.860]   But they just-- but they know.
[00:37:08.860 --> 00:37:09.860]   But they just-- but they know.
[00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:10.860]   And then they start serving up ads for Ashley Madison or--
[00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:11.860]   Well, that explains a lot.
[00:37:11.860 --> 00:37:12.860]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:12.860 --> 00:37:14.860]   I think we just had a man like that.
[00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:16.860]   That's not where I've been saying that.
[00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:17.860]   Wow.
[00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:19.860]   But like that-- I expect something like that.
[00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:20.860]   Bring back the ice.
[00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:21.860]   Bring back the ice.
[00:37:21.860 --> 00:37:22.860]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:37:22.860 --> 00:37:26.500]   She makes a very good point and it applies both to Google and Facebook.
[00:37:26.500 --> 00:37:27.500]   It's redlining.
[00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:28.500]   It's social redlining.
[00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:32.460]   Now, this is something that happened to people of lower income.
[00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:37.180]   Banks would not lend money to people in certain geographic areas.
[00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:42.140]   They redlined because those people were lower income, actually, kind of in the reverse in
[00:37:42.140 --> 00:37:43.140]   the modern era.
[00:37:43.140 --> 00:37:46.740]   Those are the people they targeted with extra low lows and subprime loans.
[00:37:46.740 --> 00:37:50.260]   But in any event, that was how the banks used that kind of information.
[00:37:50.260 --> 00:37:54.300]   She calls it-- by the way, she's the author of a book called, "I Know Who You Are," and
[00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:56.940]   "I Saw What You Did Social Networks and the Death of Privacy."
[00:37:56.940 --> 00:37:58.900]   I got to get that lady out of my life.
[00:37:58.900 --> 00:37:59.900]   Lorianne.
[00:37:59.900 --> 00:38:00.900]   Lorianne is--
[00:38:00.900 --> 00:38:01.900]   I know what you are.
[00:38:01.900 --> 00:38:02.900]   Yeah.
[00:38:02.900 --> 00:38:03.900]   Where are you?
[00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:07.060]   So she calls this weblining, data aggregation as social implications.
[00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:08.060]   Yeah, go ahead.
[00:38:08.060 --> 00:38:12.020]   When young people in poor neighborhoods are bombarded with advertisements for trade schools,
[00:38:12.020 --> 00:38:15.860]   will they be more likely than others their age to forego college?
[00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:19.100]   When women-- and this is what Teresa was talking about-- when women are shown articles about
[00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:23.940]   celebrities rather than stock market trends, will they be less likely to develop financial
[00:38:23.940 --> 00:38:25.860]   savvy?
[00:38:25.860 --> 00:38:28.500]   Advertisers-- this is actually a very interesting point.
[00:38:28.500 --> 00:38:29.500]   It is.
[00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:32.820]   It has nothing really to do with Facebook except that by aggregating information that they
[00:38:32.820 --> 00:38:37.300]   know about you with the kinds of ads they want to give you, they might in some way be
[00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:41.460]   kind of training you to be a certain kind of person.
[00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:46.140]   Advertisers are drawing new red lines, limiting people to the roles society expects them
[00:38:46.140 --> 00:38:47.140]   to play.
[00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:49.140]   This is kind of another form of Eli Perriser's filter book.
[00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:50.140]   No, it is.
[00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:51.140]   It's that.
[00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:53.340]   It's what Dana Boyd writes and talks about to some degree.
[00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:58.940]   And it's the flip side of the consumer choice argument that so much ad targeting is about,
[00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:02.940]   which is, hey, isn't the world better when you don't see ads that aren't relevant to
[00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:03.940]   you?
[00:39:03.940 --> 00:39:06.580]   Wouldn't you rather see an ad for something that coincides with your interest?
[00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:07.580]   Yeah.
[00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:11.420]   Unless it reinforces stereotypes about the website.
[00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:12.420]   The kind of person you are.
[00:39:12.420 --> 00:39:16.380]   Yeah, if it limits your flag, we're going to advertise "Kurfwasier" to you.
[00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:17.380]   That's all you're allowed to drink.
[00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:19.340]   You can't have whiskey.
[00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:21.180]   That is the end of my life right there.
[00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:27.300]   But really seriously, that creates a more uniform society, a society that people live
[00:39:27.300 --> 00:39:28.860]   up to their stereotypes.
[00:39:28.860 --> 00:39:29.860]   Here's what I would argue for.
[00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:30.860]   That's not what we want.
[00:39:30.860 --> 00:39:34.940]   Part of the challenge is the people-- we live in the age of all these tech and all this
[00:39:34.940 --> 00:39:36.580]   data is available.
[00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:39.380]   And we can build more intelligent services on top of that.
[00:39:39.380 --> 00:39:42.700]   The people at the forefront of this are the marketers and the advertisers.
[00:39:42.700 --> 00:39:44.900]   But who we already know what their interest in us is.
[00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:45.900]   They just want to make money.
[00:39:45.900 --> 00:39:46.900]   It's not a purely relationship.
[00:39:46.900 --> 00:39:50.420]   They're not trying to make you feel better about yourself or expand your range of human
[00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:51.420]   possibility.
[00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:52.940]   They want to make you buy their stuff.
[00:39:52.940 --> 00:39:55.340]   If we could balance that scale a little bit.
[00:39:55.340 --> 00:40:00.580]   So for example, all the data that AT&T has, that Google has, that the iPhone has, why
[00:40:00.580 --> 00:40:05.940]   can't it be as easy for me to synthesize and analyze that data and make empowering choices
[00:40:05.940 --> 00:40:09.340]   as it is for them to tell me who they play the role of the advertiser here at the market.
[00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:14.500]   I just give you the counter-argument.
[00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:19.700]   My job is not to create a better society.
[00:40:19.700 --> 00:40:24.420]   My job is to serve advertisements that are going to be effective.
[00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:30.420]   So if I have information about you that all my research says will help me target you with
[00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:36.940]   a more effective ad, you're telling me, oh no, salt that effective ad with some ineffective
[00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:39.460]   ads just to give you a choice in your life.
[00:40:39.460 --> 00:40:44.540]   It's what I'm not even, I'm not going to expect different behavior from them.
[00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:48.660]   What I'm saying and suggesting is more power for the user.
[00:40:48.660 --> 00:40:50.940]   For example, I mean one tangible example.
[00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:56.300]   My usage patterns of my mobile phone and the data plans and the pricing I have are not
[00:40:56.300 --> 00:40:57.300]   optimal.
[00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:59.900]   They do not result yet in me having the optimal hacking.
[00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:00.900]   And they could be.
[00:41:00.900 --> 00:41:01.900]   They could.
[00:41:01.900 --> 00:41:02.900]   All the information is there.
[00:41:02.900 --> 00:41:04.860]   By the way, we get an advertiser that's going to help you do that.
[00:41:04.860 --> 00:41:05.860]   Where my phone is.
[00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:07.460]   I use it when I turn it on and off.
[00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:08.940]   I could come in later this month.
[00:41:08.940 --> 00:41:09.940]   We've got a new advertisement.
[00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:12.340]   I could say hundreds of bucks a year.
[00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:16.380]   This is the big data era where now with all the data that you know you could actually
[00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:17.380]   be more refined.
[00:41:17.380 --> 00:41:18.380]   Maybe that's what's really going on.
[00:41:18.380 --> 00:41:19.380]   But not even that.
[00:41:19.380 --> 00:41:20.380]   Let's go further.
[00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:23.220]   Let me tell, take all that data about your corporation, about where you give campaign
[00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:26.140]   money to, about how you treat your employees.
[00:41:26.140 --> 00:41:28.060]   And let me decide where that dollar is going to go.
[00:41:28.060 --> 00:41:32.500]   It's a very unidirectional power play right now with the people with the money and the
[00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:34.380]   data are telling you who you're supposed to be.
[00:41:34.380 --> 00:41:35.380]   You're saying, I'm just saying.
[00:41:35.380 --> 00:41:37.380]   Obviously marketers aren't going to change their attitude.
[00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:38.580]   No, but we can change.
[00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:39.580]   We should demand more change.
[00:41:39.580 --> 00:41:43.780]   I guess that's the thing is I don't expect marketers to do anything different.
[00:41:43.780 --> 00:41:44.780]   No.
[00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:47.540]   But the technology that makes it possible for the marketers is also the technology that
[00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:50.580]   makes something like Google News possible.
[00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:53.980]   Google News has been my number one home page for the last guy using it.
[00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:54.980]   Congratulations.
[00:41:54.980 --> 00:41:55.980]   Yeah.
[00:41:55.980 --> 00:41:58.940]   But what I love about it is that it forces me to see articles that I never in a million
[00:41:58.940 --> 00:42:01.460]   years would seek out, you know.
[00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:03.060]   That's the counter argument to the filter bubble.
[00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:04.060]   That's what Eli Parriser says.
[00:42:04.060 --> 00:42:06.780]   We only read news that agrees with our opinions.
[00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:12.700]   And I agree with you that ultimately this is much more broadening than it is narrowing
[00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:13.700]   ultimately.
[00:42:13.700 --> 00:42:18.060]   I would say that when we look at money in politics, for example, we've seen a lot of
[00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:22.260]   reports this past week about these super PACs and who's giving money for all the various
[00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:25.660]   campaigns or not quite campaigns.
[00:42:25.660 --> 00:42:30.620]   The tradeoff we made in this country is, okay, money speaks, money is speech, sure, transparency
[00:42:30.620 --> 00:42:31.620]   balances it.
[00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:32.620]   We know who's money.
[00:42:32.620 --> 00:42:35.700]   Same thing with journalists, tech journalists who take money for the companies.
[00:42:35.700 --> 00:42:41.580]   All the transparency being offered in this data driven world is of the user toward the
[00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:42.780]   service provider.
[00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:43.980]   They know where we are.
[00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:45.380]   They know what our devices are doing.
[00:42:45.380 --> 00:42:47.260]   They know what buttons we're pressing.
[00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:50.180]   Can we, A, know all that about ourselves?
[00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:52.500]   Because it is us generating that value in that data.
[00:42:52.500 --> 00:42:54.500]   It's technically our data.
[00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:57.980]   And can we know more about these organizations and demand more of that transparency?
[00:42:57.980 --> 00:42:58.980]   I don't know.
[00:42:58.980 --> 00:43:02.340]   It's a two-side thing because you generate that data regardless whether just by virtue
[00:43:02.340 --> 00:43:03.940]   of living and being interested in things.
[00:43:03.940 --> 00:43:05.420]   That's the data stream, the smog.
[00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:06.420]   It's life stream.
[00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:07.420]   It comes off of it.
[00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:11.300]   So does it affect you in any way that some business comes along and picks up all this
[00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:15.500]   data that you're sloughing off all over your body and you're like, "Hey man, this is valuable."
[00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:17.820]   I mean, is it the case where you're like, "Well, go ahead and make money with it,"
[00:43:17.820 --> 00:43:19.060]   or you're suddenly indignant.
[00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:22.940]   You're like, "Hey, no, I want that data to just be lost and useless."
[00:43:22.940 --> 00:43:29.700]   I think it changes the nature of the data when it's no longer just passive activity and
[00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:35.300]   data, but it's insight and analysis and conclusions being drawn about you as a person.
[00:43:35.300 --> 00:43:38.940]   So I think what you're really saying is that that level of intelligence and thought added
[00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:41.460]   to the data makes it a little different.
[00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:44.540]   What you're really saying is that you shouldn't do it, but I'm saying it's no longer just
[00:43:44.540 --> 00:43:45.540]   data anymore.
[00:43:45.540 --> 00:43:49.340]   Weblining is really just because they're doing it imperfectly.
[00:43:49.340 --> 00:43:54.060]   They're assuming from a few data points that you are a certain kind of person.
[00:43:54.060 --> 00:43:58.660]   But given better information, they're not going to assume just because you live in a
[00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:05.260]   certain neighborhood or just because you buy a certain car or just because they're going
[00:44:05.260 --> 00:44:10.300]   to know more about you and give you ads that are actually, in fact, tailored to you.
[00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:15.220]   I think even in this case, this may be where Parris' work comes in and I haven't read his
[00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:16.220]   whole book yet.
[00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:20.380]   I only saw some of the talk, the TED talk he did, but even in a perfect data world, which
[00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:23.940]   is impossible, but you can get closer to it.
[00:44:23.940 --> 00:44:27.060]   And they're more accurately tracking and representing these people.
[00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:31.740]   There is some loss in society of only having a targeted experience.
[00:44:31.740 --> 00:44:35.140]   If the experience of all the media and your life, of all the ads and your life, of all
[00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:40.460]   the commercial messages and social cues is only reinforcing what that world thinks you
[00:44:40.460 --> 00:44:45.060]   are, you're missing the serendipity, you're missing the magic, you're missing the contrast.
[00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:47.180]   Well, thank God, we still have the Super Bowl.
[00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:48.180]   I mean, that is.
[00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:51.220]   Well, seriously, the ads you're going to watch on the Super Bowl are aimed at 100 million
[00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:52.220]   people who don't name it.
[00:44:52.220 --> 00:44:55.260]   You or you or me, they're aimed at 100 million people.
[00:44:55.260 --> 00:45:00.020]   There is broader brush as you can get and people are still willing to spend millions
[00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:01.580]   of dollars on those ads.
[00:45:01.580 --> 00:45:02.580]   Right.
[00:45:02.580 --> 00:45:03.580]   They must work.
[00:45:03.580 --> 00:45:07.260]   So the idea of all of us living in bubbles, it's almost like a, I don't know if this is
[00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:10.660]   too weird a metaphor, but it's almost like the prisoner's dilemma where it's like you
[00:45:10.660 --> 00:45:14.100]   personally, there's no reason you shouldn't want all of your ads to be targeted.
[00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:16.500]   There's no reason you shouldn't want all your news to be targeted.
[00:45:16.500 --> 00:45:21.100]   But if everybody does it, if everybody defaults on the prisoner's dilemma, society as a whole
[00:45:21.100 --> 00:45:24.260]   totally becomes extra polarized and we all lose as a result.
[00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:26.860]   And theory says it's flops.
[00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:27.860]   Exactly.
[00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:28.860]   Let's go even further though.
[00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:32.220]   And let's ask, I'm going to have some more whiskey.
[00:45:32.220 --> 00:45:38.420]   Are we, so again, even in a perfect data world where the ads are genuinely targeted based
[00:45:38.420 --> 00:45:42.900]   on a hundred percent knowledge of the bits that comprise your body, your life, do we
[00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:48.340]   want to live in a world where advertising dominates the experience so much?
[00:45:48.340 --> 00:45:49.340]   We already do.
[00:45:49.340 --> 00:45:50.340]   But do we want to?
[00:45:50.340 --> 00:45:51.340]   Oh, can you live in a game?
[00:45:51.340 --> 00:45:53.100]   No, no, no, we can't.
[00:45:53.100 --> 00:45:54.100]   We can't possibly.
[00:45:54.100 --> 00:45:55.100]   Okay, Dick, we're the greatest.
[00:45:55.100 --> 00:46:00.900]   There is something perverse about a totally sales driven world.
[00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:05.140]   There's something honest about admitting that we've always lived in a totally sales driven
[00:46:05.140 --> 00:46:06.140]   world.
[00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:07.140]   Now we've reached our moment.
[00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:08.140]   Let's go.
[00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:10.420]   All right, we're going to take a break.
[00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:12.260]   What a great discussion.
[00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:13.420]   Baratode Thurston is here.
[00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:15.700]   His new book is called How To Be Black.
[00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:18.100]   You could find more at what's the best site to go.
[00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:19.100]   How to be black.me.
[00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:20.100]   Got it.
[00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:21.660]   How to be black.me.
[00:46:21.660 --> 00:46:24.340]   Brian Brushwood is the host of Scam School on Revision Street.
[00:46:24.340 --> 00:46:25.420]   I'm writing a book.
[00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:26.500]   The Scam School book.
[00:46:26.500 --> 00:46:27.500]   You should write a book.
[00:46:27.500 --> 00:46:28.500]   You should write a book.
[00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:29.500]   Yeah, I have.
[00:46:29.500 --> 00:46:31.300]   I wrote the professionals' guide to fire eating in a couple of others, but we're about
[00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:33.140]   80 percent done on the Scam School book.
[00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:34.140]   Really?
[00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:35.140]   Yeah.
[00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:36.380]   We're probably going to try to do a targeted strike.
[00:46:36.380 --> 00:46:39.900]   See, whereas you get people to buy your book by being engaging and having people love
[00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:41.820]   you, I plan to cheat.
[00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:47.260]   And we're going to target March 1st is the day I want everybody to buy it on that exact
[00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:49.340]   day and I'm going to price it stupidly low.
[00:46:49.340 --> 00:46:53.900]   So for one hilarious moment, I could be like the number one book on any spot.
[00:46:53.900 --> 00:46:54.900]   Nice.
[00:46:54.900 --> 00:46:55.900]   You'll bomb it.
[00:46:55.900 --> 00:46:56.900]   Exactly.
[00:46:56.900 --> 00:46:57.900]   That's a really interesting strategy.
[00:46:57.900 --> 00:46:58.900]   Like the money bomb.
[00:46:58.900 --> 00:46:59.900]   That's where the idea came from.
[00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:00.900]   I would like to point something out.
[00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:02.140]   We are all selling something.
[00:47:02.140 --> 00:47:07.900]   If not a book or a product or a bottle of whiskey, you're selling it to an employer.
[00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:09.660]   You're selling yourself as an employee.
[00:47:09.660 --> 00:47:14.620]   So I think this distinction between marketers and regular people is a little artificial.
[00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:16.580]   Everybody's selling something.
[00:47:16.580 --> 00:47:24.060]   And really, life itself is about enrolling other people into you, isn't it?
[00:47:24.060 --> 00:47:25.060]   Oh, sure.
[00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:28.780]   What we're really looking at here is fascinating new ways.
[00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:31.700]   Both of you guys are great examples of doing this.
[00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:37.020]   Not necessarily ways that are mean or degrading.
[00:47:37.020 --> 00:47:39.780]   There are elements of it that become ugly.
[00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:42.260]   And that happens anytime you have a totally free market.
[00:47:42.260 --> 00:47:46.180]   There's an ugly side of it where for as much as I'm making a joke about how I want to
[00:47:46.180 --> 00:47:47.180]   game the system.
[00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:48.580]   The fact is, I want to game the system.
[00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:49.580]   Yeah.
[00:47:49.580 --> 00:47:50.580]   And that's not pretty big.
[00:47:50.580 --> 00:47:51.580]   It's not on pretty to say.
[00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:54.260]   Let me phrase it differently.
[00:47:54.260 --> 00:47:58.020]   You want to maximize your advantage in getting your book out there.
[00:47:58.020 --> 00:47:59.020]   It's not the legal.
[00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:00.020]   It's not the legal.
[00:48:00.020 --> 00:48:01.820]   It doesn't necessarily hurt.
[00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:03.700]   But you're not hurting anybody.
[00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:07.540]   And so that's really the question that I have to ask, weblining or not, when I look at
[00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:12.660]   the ads that are for me on Facebook, the card for super fans, they know I'm a super
[00:48:12.660 --> 00:48:15.780]   49er fan, a retro iPhone doc.
[00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:19.180]   And who does this hurt that these ads, mature American women?
[00:48:19.180 --> 00:48:20.180]   Oh, wow.
[00:48:20.180 --> 00:48:24.460]   Are targeted a little bit more because it knows a little bit.
[00:48:24.460 --> 00:48:25.460]   Who does that hurt?
[00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:26.460]   Nobody.
[00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:28.740]   I think it's a good question to segue to a break.
[00:48:28.740 --> 00:48:30.580]   Let's do a commercial targeted at you.
[00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:33.620]   He's way, he waved at me.
[00:48:33.620 --> 00:48:35.100]   Did you see that?
[00:48:35.100 --> 00:48:37.100]   Yeah, that's for me.
[00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:38.100]   How many of you waved?
[00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:39.100]   Okay.
[00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:40.460]   I'm going to talk a little bit about gazelle.com.
[00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:42.180]   This really is a targeted ad.
[00:48:42.180 --> 00:48:44.860]   And it's a great ad for everybody who watches any of our shows.
[00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:45.860]   You know about gazelle, right?
[00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:50.820]   Gazelle is the place you go to get rid of all the junk, all the crap you've got in
[00:48:50.820 --> 00:48:52.820]   your drawers and your closet.
[00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:54.980]   Everybody who's in the tech collects old tech.
[00:48:54.980 --> 00:48:56.080]   It's just what happens.
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:57.080]   And what do you do?
[00:48:57.080 --> 00:48:58.860]   You know, they, you can't, you don't want to throw in the trash.
[00:48:58.860 --> 00:49:00.620]   It's got value.
[00:49:00.620 --> 00:49:02.100]   Some of you may have the energy.
[00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:05.580]   I know Dan, our chat moderator, he sells all his stuff on eBay, but that's a lot of
[00:49:05.580 --> 00:49:06.580]   work.
[00:49:06.580 --> 00:49:07.580]   Got it.
[00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:11.100]   But can I just say real quick, we, for some reason, we always get talking about the free
[00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:12.100]   market.
[00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:15.180]   And that's a great example of purely from selfish desires.
[00:49:15.180 --> 00:49:17.460]   They're doing really, really good things.
[00:49:17.460 --> 00:49:18.460]   It's a great company.
[00:49:18.460 --> 00:49:19.460]   It's a great company.
[00:49:19.460 --> 00:49:20.460]   Yeah.
[00:49:20.460 --> 00:49:21.460]   It's efficient.
[00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:25.020]   When you think about this whole sector, the economy, the shared economy, the access
[00:49:25.020 --> 00:49:30.980]   economy, you have neighbor goods, zipped car, buzz car, Zim rides, like all these tools
[00:49:30.980 --> 00:49:35.620]   are getting more return out of the capital already invested in a resource.
[00:49:35.620 --> 00:49:36.620]   Absolutely.
[00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:37.620]   The efficient property automobile.
[00:49:37.620 --> 00:49:40.300]   It's the efficiency of the internet made real.
[00:49:40.300 --> 00:49:41.300]   I love that.
[00:49:41.300 --> 00:49:46.140]   I mean, there's something horribly uncapitalistic about everybody owning a car that sits idle
[00:49:46.140 --> 00:49:47.300]   for 20 hours a day.
[00:49:47.300 --> 00:49:48.300]   Absolutely.
[00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:49.300]   Absolutely.
[00:49:49.300 --> 00:49:50.300]   That's the promise of autonomous vehicles.
[00:49:50.300 --> 00:49:51.220]   We'll talk about that in a second.
[00:49:51.220 --> 00:49:53.140]   But first, let's, we got to do the ad.
[00:49:53.140 --> 00:49:54.140]   Yeah.
[00:49:54.140 --> 00:49:55.140]   So you got an iPad too.
[00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:56.980]   You know an iPad three is coming now.
[00:49:56.980 --> 00:50:00.180]   When the iPad three comes out, this is the first place you're going to go.
[00:50:00.180 --> 00:50:04.300]   You're going to take that 32 gigabyte Wi-Fi iPad, sell it for 280 bucks.
[00:50:04.300 --> 00:50:05.700]   You're halfway towards your new iPad.
[00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:06.700]   How do you like that?
[00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:07.860]   My hand.
[00:50:07.860 --> 00:50:11.260]   You can now, once you say, okay, by the way, if it's in flawless condition, you're
[00:50:11.260 --> 00:50:13.260]   going to get 320 bucks.
[00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:14.260]   Nice.
[00:50:14.260 --> 00:50:15.260]   They will take it.
[00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:17.380]   So what's going to happen is you're going to get a box.
[00:50:17.380 --> 00:50:19.540]   Any box, you're going to pile all this stuff in there.
[00:50:19.540 --> 00:50:20.540]   I love piles.
[00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:21.540]   I know.
[00:50:21.540 --> 00:50:22.980]   Well, it's in a pile right now and you're drawer.
[00:50:22.980 --> 00:50:23.980]   Take it and put it in the box.
[00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:25.180]   Transfer the pile to the box.
[00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:26.420]   They will give you a mailing label.
[00:50:26.420 --> 00:50:29.380]   They take care of the shipping on anything worth more than a dollar.
[00:50:29.380 --> 00:50:30.380]   You ship it back to them.
[00:50:30.380 --> 00:50:31.380]   Now here's the nice part.
[00:50:31.380 --> 00:50:34.420]   They have data experts who will, first of all, verify that it's in the condition.
[00:50:34.420 --> 00:50:39.020]   You said it was, but they will also wipe all the personal data of their.
[00:50:39.020 --> 00:50:40.780]   So they will verify it.
[00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:42.700]   They will then send you a check.
[00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:43.700]   You can go to PayPal.
[00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:45.020]   They'll give you PayPal.
[00:50:45.020 --> 00:50:46.020]   Walmart gift card.
[00:50:46.020 --> 00:50:47.020]   There's lots of ways to get paid.
[00:50:47.020 --> 00:50:49.620]   The one I'm going to recommend Amazon gift card.
[00:50:49.620 --> 00:50:52.180]   If you like to use Amazon, who doesn't?
[00:50:52.180 --> 00:50:54.220]   5% more if you do it through Amazon.
[00:50:54.220 --> 00:50:56.540]   They basically rebate the associate fee.
[00:50:56.540 --> 00:50:58.020]   Isn't that smart?
[00:50:58.020 --> 00:50:59.020]   Yeah.
[00:50:59.020 --> 00:51:02.820]   So get paid with an Amazon gift card or cash if you want the cash.
[00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:06.620]   It's just a really fantastic way to take those gadgets.
[00:51:06.620 --> 00:51:08.380]   I'm going to add this to my box right here.
[00:51:08.380 --> 00:51:10.060]   Let's say Amazon gift card.
[00:51:10.060 --> 00:51:11.060]   Thank you very much.
[00:51:11.060 --> 00:51:12.460]   It's in flawless condition.
[00:51:12.460 --> 00:51:14.580]   And get all those gadgets and get cash for them.
[00:51:14.580 --> 00:51:18.980]   Now if the gadget is worthless, and that sometimes happens, I've got an old blackberry
[00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:19.980]   curve.
[00:51:19.980 --> 00:51:20.980]   I'm not going to get much money for.
[00:51:20.980 --> 00:51:21.980]   Actually, let me just check.
[00:51:21.980 --> 00:51:23.780]   I don't know.
[00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:25.420]   Look at my Casio E100.
[00:51:25.420 --> 00:51:27.700]   Yeah, I have the $93.30.
[00:51:27.700 --> 00:51:29.500]   I can't believe this is worth anything.
[00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:30.500]   Yeah.
[00:51:30.500 --> 00:51:32.140]   So this is, but we'll see that button recycle.
[00:51:32.140 --> 00:51:34.460]   So what they do is they do green recycling.
[00:51:34.460 --> 00:51:35.620]   It never goes into landfill.
[00:51:35.620 --> 00:51:36.620]   Not one bit of it.
[00:51:36.620 --> 00:51:38.100]   It never goes offshore.
[00:51:38.100 --> 00:51:41.460]   It's handled appropriately by their green recyclers.
[00:51:41.460 --> 00:51:42.460]   And that way you're guaranteed.
[00:51:42.460 --> 00:51:44.460]   You know, you could just throw this in the box.
[00:51:44.460 --> 00:51:46.700]   Since I've already got stuff of value in there, they're going to continue to pay the
[00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:47.700]   postage.
[00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:48.700]   I just love this.
[00:51:48.700 --> 00:51:50.900]   It is a great way to raise money for a charity.
[00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:53.700]   You can have a Gazelle charity page, a gadget drive.
[00:51:53.700 --> 00:51:56.620]   You know, so if your baseball team wants to raise money, you can have a bake sale, but
[00:51:56.620 --> 00:51:57.940]   you can also have a gadget.
[00:51:57.940 --> 00:51:58.940]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:51:58.940 --> 00:51:59.940]   Gazelle.com.
[00:51:59.940 --> 00:52:01.660]   Keep it moving.
[00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:02.660]   That's the whole idea.
[00:52:02.660 --> 00:52:04.380]   I want you to go to Gazelle.com.
[00:52:04.380 --> 00:52:05.380]   You don't even have to use it.
[00:52:05.380 --> 00:52:07.780]   Just find out what your stuff's worth and then decide.
[00:52:07.780 --> 00:52:10.740]   But I have a feeling once you see the hundreds of dollars, it's worth your going to take
[00:52:10.740 --> 00:52:11.900]   advantage of this.
[00:52:11.900 --> 00:52:13.780]   And again, remember the little tip I gave you.
[00:52:13.780 --> 00:52:16.060]   Use the Amazon gift card for 5% more.
[00:52:16.060 --> 00:52:19.060]   G-A-Z-E-L-L-E.com.
[00:52:19.060 --> 00:52:22.460]   Don't sell it.
[00:52:22.460 --> 00:52:23.460]   Gazelle it.
[00:52:23.460 --> 00:52:25.460]   Wait, did you just make that up?
[00:52:25.460 --> 00:52:26.460]   Yeah, not just.
[00:52:26.460 --> 00:52:27.460]   Okay.
[00:52:27.460 --> 00:52:29.220]   I was thinking all night.
[00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:30.220]   Turning them into a burn.
[00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:35.340]   I wonder what other uses of funds you could direct this to.
[00:52:35.340 --> 00:52:36.340]   Like you said, charity.
[00:52:36.340 --> 00:52:37.340]   You do charities.
[00:52:37.340 --> 00:52:38.340]   I was also.
[00:52:38.340 --> 00:52:39.340]   Schools.
[00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:40.340]   I was thinking about local.
[00:52:40.340 --> 00:52:41.340]   Girl Scouts.
[00:52:41.340 --> 00:52:43.900]   Areas like local businesses that are often feeling.
[00:52:43.900 --> 00:52:44.900]   Totally.
[00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:45.900]   Threatened and totally.
[00:52:45.900 --> 00:52:46.900]   Todepon by a lot of internet stuff.
[00:52:46.900 --> 00:52:50.780]   If some of them got together or there's some towns with their own currencies and said,
[00:52:50.780 --> 00:52:55.060]   we'll work with Gazelle, clean out your garages for all this crap and it'll become local
[00:52:55.060 --> 00:52:56.060]   dollars plus 5%.
[00:52:56.060 --> 00:53:02.180]   Well, you know, many local waste districts have electronics drives because people throw
[00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:04.340]   everything, including batteries into the trash.
[00:53:04.340 --> 00:53:06.740]   Yeah, not supposed to be really bad.
[00:53:06.740 --> 00:53:07.740]   We had a, we had.
[00:53:07.740 --> 00:53:09.980]   So they have to have electronic recycling drives.
[00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:11.540]   This they could just do it instead with Gazelle.
[00:53:11.540 --> 00:53:12.540]   Yeah.
[00:53:12.540 --> 00:53:14.980]   Yeah, we had a, we had a friend of ours in Germany.
[00:53:14.980 --> 00:53:18.460]   Their son stayed with us for a week and he was horrified when we went to go throw batteries
[00:53:18.460 --> 00:53:19.460]   in the trash.
[00:53:19.460 --> 00:53:20.620]   He was like, you don't do that.
[00:53:20.620 --> 00:53:21.620]   That's horrible.
[00:53:21.620 --> 00:53:22.620]   We got standards.
[00:53:22.620 --> 00:53:23.620]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:53:23.620 --> 00:53:27.180]   I confess I do because I don't know what else.
[00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:29.100]   What are you going to have a box?
[00:53:29.100 --> 00:53:30.100]   Exactly.
[00:53:30.100 --> 00:53:31.340]   Can you Gazelle batteries?
[00:53:31.340 --> 00:53:32.740]   I put it in the recycling.
[00:53:32.740 --> 00:53:33.740]   You know what?
[00:53:33.740 --> 00:53:36.140]   They'll throw the batteries in anyway.
[00:53:36.140 --> 00:53:37.140]   Seriously.
[00:53:37.140 --> 00:53:38.140]   Yes.
[00:53:38.140 --> 00:53:39.140]   You made the batteries in.
[00:53:39.140 --> 00:53:40.140]   You made the batteries in.
[00:53:40.140 --> 00:53:41.140]   They're in their cost structure.
[00:53:41.140 --> 00:53:42.140]   No, they don't.
[00:53:42.140 --> 00:53:43.140]   They're nice guys.
[00:53:43.140 --> 00:53:44.140]   Seriously.
[00:53:44.140 --> 00:53:47.620]   They want, they believe in a green world and that's like the Toyota lithium batteries
[00:53:47.620 --> 00:53:48.620]   from the previous.
[00:53:48.620 --> 00:53:49.620]   Yes.
[00:53:49.620 --> 00:53:51.180]   Instead of going to Gazelle it.
[00:53:51.180 --> 00:53:54.620]   Instead of putting packing peanuts in there, packing with metals to them.
[00:53:54.620 --> 00:53:55.620]   Yeah.
[00:53:55.620 --> 00:53:58.020]   Metal and cans showing wires.
[00:53:58.020 --> 00:53:59.020]   It was a good run with Gazelle.
[00:53:59.020 --> 00:54:01.260]   I'm glad we had them as a sponsor for a while.
[00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:03.180]   The day we spoke.
[00:54:03.180 --> 00:54:04.380]   Why are we getting all these batteries?
[00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:09.220]   I'll lay out said it was okay.
[00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:10.740]   Let's see.
[00:54:10.740 --> 00:54:15.980]   The cell phone privacy bill representative Marky has released a draft of this.
[00:54:15.980 --> 00:54:20.740]   You probably would like this idea since you're so private.
[00:54:20.740 --> 00:54:23.140]   The idea is called the mobile device privacy act.
[00:54:23.140 --> 00:54:26.300]   We give Congress such a hard time with new things like soap and paper.
[00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:29.300]   Let's give them a little bit of praise when they do something smart.
[00:54:29.300 --> 00:54:30.500]   So tell us more about this.
[00:54:30.500 --> 00:54:34.420]   All right, it would, for instance, force the cell phone carriers to disclose if they're
[00:54:34.420 --> 00:54:36.460]   using carrier IQ.
[00:54:36.460 --> 00:54:39.700]   That was the software that was monitoring everything you do.
[00:54:39.700 --> 00:54:41.980]   And what information the software is collecting.
[00:54:41.980 --> 00:54:46.540]   You would have to consent to any data collection or transmission.
[00:54:46.540 --> 00:54:49.820]   Third parties would have to have policies in place to secure the data.
[00:54:49.820 --> 00:54:53.740]   It's not only do you have to give them permission, but they are required if you do give them
[00:54:53.740 --> 00:54:56.180]   permission to secure it so somebody can't steal it.
[00:54:56.180 --> 00:55:00.460]   Let's remember that about every six months we hear a story of credit card information.
[00:55:00.460 --> 00:55:05.260]   Views of account information, hundreds of thousands of people's stuff lost on a zip.
[00:55:05.260 --> 00:55:06.260]   Not a zip.
[00:55:06.260 --> 00:55:07.260]   I don't know.
[00:55:07.260 --> 00:55:08.260]   Do you want to be sick?
[00:55:08.260 --> 00:55:10.260]   Now you're the free market liberator.
[00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:16.980]   I'm trying to think of a situation where I would disagree with this bill.
[00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:18.460]   And it's a little bit tough.
[00:55:18.460 --> 00:55:22.100]   The only thing I'm going to knock on it is like having a law saying you need to protect
[00:55:22.100 --> 00:55:25.180]   information is like they don't want information to get out anyway.
[00:55:25.180 --> 00:55:31.060]   And if you want to make a law, say what the penalty should be for if information get
[00:55:31.060 --> 00:55:33.540]   least lost, you know, hold them accountable.
[00:55:33.540 --> 00:55:36.300]   Although even I'm sure that there's penalties in there.
[00:55:36.300 --> 00:55:37.900]   Even that sort of happens automatically.
[00:55:37.900 --> 00:55:39.660]   AT&D doesn't want to lose information.
[00:55:39.660 --> 00:55:43.500]   It's a major PR disaster when somebody steals a bunch of stuff.
[00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:44.660]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:45.660]   I don't know.
[00:55:45.660 --> 00:55:47.020]   Maybe they don't really care.
[00:55:47.020 --> 00:55:48.660]   This is a soft spot for me.
[00:55:48.660 --> 00:55:52.980]   I'm okay with anyone who's pro privacy on people.
[00:55:52.980 --> 00:55:56.580]   I was impressed that Marky is a part of something in Congress called the privacy caucus.
[00:55:56.580 --> 00:55:58.260]   He's the head of that.
[00:55:58.260 --> 00:56:00.980]   Which and we do give our matching jackets.
[00:56:00.980 --> 00:56:02.980]   Hope they do.
[00:56:02.980 --> 00:56:07.820]   We do give our public elected officials a tough time when it comes to the internet.
[00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:08.820]   Like learn the internet.
[00:56:08.820 --> 00:56:10.140]   You don't understand how anything works.
[00:56:10.140 --> 00:56:13.220]   So that always makes me a little cautious when they try to do things.
[00:56:13.220 --> 00:56:15.140]   Marky though is one of the smarter guys out there.
[00:56:15.140 --> 00:56:16.140]   I like Marky's.
[00:56:16.140 --> 00:56:17.980]   And they're just we're moving.
[00:56:17.980 --> 00:56:20.620]   We're technology always outpaces the law.
[00:56:20.620 --> 00:56:24.660]   This is the case of the law trying to keep pace in a way that is hopefully intelligent.
[00:56:24.660 --> 00:56:29.820]   And even if it doesn't become a law, there's power in the signal that they're sending that
[00:56:29.820 --> 00:56:34.260]   we're paying attention that this is important, that you don't just have will and ill ability
[00:56:34.260 --> 00:56:37.820]   to go do these things and that we're trying to look out for our constituents.
[00:56:37.820 --> 00:56:42.500]   Which it is our job to try to do that maybe the market alone can't solve this.
[00:56:42.500 --> 00:56:45.860]   And so that's where you have policy and attempt to come in and sort this out.
[00:56:45.860 --> 00:56:49.180]   Even a guy like Brian Brushwood, it must admit that we need government for some things.
[00:56:49.180 --> 00:56:50.180]   Oh yeah, absolutely.
[00:56:50.180 --> 00:56:54.220]   I mean in fact the worst places on earth are the place where there's not enough government
[00:56:54.220 --> 00:56:58.100]   to enforce contract law or to protect the rights of individual citizens.
[00:56:58.100 --> 00:57:00.100]   Just to make sure water is potable.
[00:57:00.100 --> 00:57:01.100]   Yeah.
[00:57:01.100 --> 00:57:02.100]   So, so iPhone.
[00:57:02.100 --> 00:57:03.100]   Yes.
[00:57:03.100 --> 00:57:04.100]   iPhone.
[00:57:04.100 --> 00:57:05.100]   What about it?
[00:57:05.100 --> 00:57:06.100]   It is a thing.
[00:57:06.100 --> 00:57:07.100]   I have one.
[00:57:07.100 --> 00:57:08.100]   Oh okay.
[00:57:08.100 --> 00:57:09.100]   You're like, no, I'm Brian.
[00:57:09.100 --> 00:57:10.100]   How many?
[00:57:10.100 --> 00:57:11.100]   I don't know why you're speaking.
[00:57:11.100 --> 00:57:12.100]   I'm a human being.
[00:57:12.100 --> 00:57:13.100]   What nouns Leo, you could use verbs and uh, iPhones.
[00:57:13.100 --> 00:57:14.900]   Yeah, I use a phone.
[00:57:14.900 --> 00:57:18.900]   So I keep my iPhone on 18TY because I have unlimited data, right?
[00:57:18.900 --> 00:57:19.900]   I'm a grandfather.
[00:57:19.900 --> 00:57:20.900]   Yeah, same here.
[00:57:20.900 --> 00:57:22.580]   Oh my God, they're locked in forever.
[00:57:22.580 --> 00:57:23.580]   Bad news.
[00:57:23.580 --> 00:57:25.340]   Oh no, are they taking that away?
[00:57:25.340 --> 00:57:28.220]   Well, no, they're going to cry my data from my cold day.
[00:57:28.220 --> 00:57:31.300]   They want to, but they can't because they kind of promised.
[00:57:31.300 --> 00:57:34.860]   So instead what they're going to do is throttle you after you use two gigabytes.
[00:57:34.860 --> 00:57:35.860]   Oh no.
[00:57:35.860 --> 00:57:36.860]   They're going to beat me.
[00:57:36.860 --> 00:57:37.860]   I am.
[00:57:37.860 --> 00:57:38.860]   Yes.
[00:57:38.860 --> 00:57:39.860]   Some guy from 18's he's going to show up.
[00:57:39.860 --> 00:57:40.860]   Why you little.
[00:57:40.860 --> 00:57:42.860]   I'm throttling you.
[00:57:42.860 --> 00:57:47.500]   So this is actually I've started to get a lot of email from listeners, a lot of email
[00:57:47.500 --> 00:57:53.460]   from people who've got this notice from AT&T where it says you're in the top five percent
[00:57:53.460 --> 00:57:58.980]   of users and we're going to slow your access down until next month.
[00:57:58.980 --> 00:58:03.260]   Ah, well, okay, at least they're disclosing, which makes me slightly less enraged.
[00:58:03.260 --> 00:58:04.660]   I'm still enraged though.
[00:58:04.660 --> 00:58:05.660]   It's like, when is this?
[00:58:05.660 --> 00:58:06.660]   When is this going to take a while?
[00:58:06.660 --> 00:58:08.660]   It already is in effect.
[00:58:08.660 --> 00:58:12.020]   The company said initially that they'd only throttle you if you were in the top five
[00:58:12.020 --> 00:58:13.020]   percent of users.
[00:58:13.020 --> 00:58:14.020]   Oh man.
[00:58:14.020 --> 00:58:15.260]   That would be 10 to 12 gigs.
[00:58:15.260 --> 00:58:17.260]   But now they've lowered that all the way down to.
[00:58:17.260 --> 00:58:22.340]   Well, I have been receiving email and this article in Mac Roomers confirms it from people
[00:58:22.340 --> 00:58:28.100]   who are getting that top five percent warning after reaching as little as two gigabytes.
[00:58:28.100 --> 00:58:31.380]   Do you think they're fudging the numbers on whose top five percent?
[00:58:31.380 --> 00:58:36.860]   I got to think that more than one in 20 people uses more than two gigabytes.
[00:58:36.860 --> 00:58:37.860]   Absolutely.
[00:58:37.860 --> 00:58:38.860]   More than two gigabytes.
[00:58:38.860 --> 00:58:39.860]   Yeah.
[00:58:39.860 --> 00:58:40.860]   More than two gigabytes.
[00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:41.860]   I'm actually looking it up right now.
[00:58:41.860 --> 00:58:42.860]   Let's check.
[00:58:42.860 --> 00:58:45.820]   For example, there are times I'm out on the road and they'll send me the rough cut of scam
[00:58:45.820 --> 00:58:47.940]   school every week to go over.
[00:58:47.940 --> 00:58:50.380]   And it's like just just previewing that on my iPhone.
[00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:51.380]   That's what.
[00:58:51.380 --> 00:58:52.380]   You are the problem.
[00:58:52.380 --> 00:58:53.380]   That's 10 percent of my whole data.
[00:58:53.380 --> 00:58:54.380]   But it's a totally legitimate use.
[00:58:54.380 --> 00:58:55.860]   Why are you driving up my prices, Brian?
[00:58:55.860 --> 00:58:56.860]   Wow.
[00:58:56.860 --> 00:58:57.860]   God.
[00:58:57.860 --> 00:58:58.860]   Really?
[00:58:58.860 --> 00:58:59.860]   Why?
[00:58:59.860 --> 00:59:00.860]   Because I'm the one percent.
[00:59:00.860 --> 00:59:01.860]   So here's the deal.
[00:59:01.860 --> 00:59:02.860]   1% user.
[00:59:02.860 --> 00:59:03.860]   Let me see.
[00:59:03.860 --> 00:59:04.860]   This is number 26.
[00:59:04.860 --> 00:59:07.140]   I have used 1.4 gigabytes.
[00:59:07.140 --> 00:59:08.140]   So that's where you guys going.
[00:59:08.140 --> 00:59:09.500]   I don't even look at this stuff.
[00:59:09.500 --> 00:59:13.500]   In under settings, general usage, cellular usage.
[00:59:13.500 --> 00:59:18.940]   So since I reset at December 6, so it's two months.
[00:59:18.940 --> 00:59:20.940]   Oh dear God.
[00:59:20.940 --> 00:59:22.700]   I've used only two gigabytes.
[00:59:22.700 --> 00:59:23.700]   There you go.
[00:59:23.700 --> 00:59:24.700]   Less than you thought.
[00:59:24.700 --> 00:59:25.700]   Yeah.
[00:59:25.700 --> 00:59:26.700]   All right.
[00:59:26.700 --> 00:59:27.700]   I don't care about this man.
[00:59:27.700 --> 00:59:28.700]   There you go.
[00:59:28.700 --> 00:59:29.700]   Okay.
[00:59:29.700 --> 00:59:30.700]   Hey Brian, sorry guys.
[00:59:30.700 --> 00:59:31.700]   Sorted.
[00:59:31.700 --> 00:59:32.700]   Holy crap.
[00:59:32.700 --> 00:59:33.700]   You are in the 5%.
[00:59:33.700 --> 00:59:34.700]   What about you?
[00:59:34.700 --> 00:59:35.700]   I received 10.8 gigabytes.
[00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:38.500]   What sent for you doing throttle this guy?
[00:59:38.500 --> 00:59:42.580]   Are you a mega uploader trying to salvage all the user files?
[00:59:42.580 --> 00:59:44.460]   What are you doing since the date?
[00:59:44.460 --> 00:59:45.460]   What's the date?
[00:59:45.460 --> 00:59:46.460]   Since when?
[00:59:46.460 --> 00:59:48.300]   It says, "Krypt period six days, five hours."
[00:59:48.300 --> 00:59:49.300]   In the time.
[00:59:49.300 --> 00:59:50.300]   No, no, no.
[00:59:50.300 --> 00:59:51.300]   Give me your phone.
[00:59:51.300 --> 00:59:52.300]   Give me your phone.
[00:59:52.300 --> 00:59:53.300]   Give me since how long?
[00:59:53.300 --> 00:59:54.300]   Now I'm going to shut this off around.
[00:59:54.300 --> 00:59:55.300]   She's Louise.
[00:59:55.300 --> 00:59:56.300]   Okay.
[00:59:56.300 --> 00:59:57.300]   No, no, no.
[00:59:57.300 --> 00:59:58.300]   Okay.
[00:59:58.300 --> 00:59:59.300]   This is okay.
[00:59:59.300 --> 01:00:00.300]   This is since October 14.
[01:00:00.300 --> 01:00:01.300]   Okay.
[01:00:01.300 --> 01:00:02.300]   It's 11.
[01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:03.300]   November, December, January.
[01:00:03.300 --> 01:00:05.540]   But that still has to be like a four gig, four and a half months.
[01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:06.540]   Yeah.
[01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:07.540]   It's still over.
[01:00:07.540 --> 01:00:08.540]   It's still three and a half.
[01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:09.540]   Yeah.
[01:00:09.540 --> 01:00:10.540]   That's the bad guy.
[01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:11.540]   Wow.
[01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:12.540]   That was pretty scary.
[01:00:12.540 --> 01:00:15.420]   I actually had a brush with it.
[01:00:15.420 --> 01:00:18.380]   So I just, you know, this is, what are you surprised?
[01:00:18.380 --> 01:00:19.380]   This is what happens.
[01:00:19.380 --> 01:00:20.380]   Yeah.
[01:00:20.380 --> 01:00:23.640]   I also, I consciously shift my data usage to the iPad.
[01:00:23.640 --> 01:00:24.640]   Right.
[01:00:24.640 --> 01:00:26.340]   Because it's, I've got unlimited there.
[01:00:26.340 --> 01:00:29.020]   I've been international for significant chunk of the past month.
[01:00:29.020 --> 01:00:30.860]   I was two weeks in India.
[01:00:30.860 --> 01:00:34.660]   And I didn't want to be using data over there on my phone.
[01:00:34.660 --> 01:00:35.660]   I'll tell you what.
[01:00:35.660 --> 01:00:37.800]   The per bit rate is much higher on the phone than the iPad.
[01:00:37.800 --> 01:00:41.200]   I don't want to say good, but I kind of want to say good AT&T.
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:44.100]   I dare you to push this and I will be out so fast.
[01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:46.540]   Because I think that's the only thing holding us there is that we all.
[01:00:46.540 --> 01:00:47.540]   Where you going to go?
[01:00:47.540 --> 01:00:48.540]   Where you going to go?
[01:00:48.540 --> 01:00:49.540]   I'm going to go.
[01:00:49.540 --> 01:00:53.380]   Well, everybody throttles, but it's a lie that we have free unlimited.
[01:00:53.380 --> 01:00:54.380]   Yeah.
[01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:55.380]   Whatever it is.
[01:00:55.380 --> 01:00:56.380]   There's a lot of things in our society there.
[01:00:56.380 --> 01:00:57.380]   They're lies.
[01:00:57.380 --> 01:00:58.380]   Really?
[01:00:58.380 --> 01:00:59.380]   Yeah.
[01:00:59.380 --> 01:01:00.380]   Damn.
[01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:01.380]   I blame the marketers.
[01:01:01.380 --> 01:01:02.380]   All right.
[01:01:02.380 --> 01:01:06.020]   What's, what's another mega uploads files deleted by Thursday?
[01:01:06.020 --> 01:01:10.240]   You guys upset by the mega upload thing or not?
[01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:11.800]   You know, they have to have to say.
[01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:16.180]   I mean, on the surface of it, they seem like they really were kind of.
[01:01:16.180 --> 01:01:17.180]   Oh, no.
[01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:18.180]   They were total jerks.
[01:01:18.180 --> 01:01:22.060]   And in fact, a friend of mine, Andrew Maine, creates a lot of illusion DVDs.
[01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:24.740]   And the mega upload was pirating, you know, had them available.
[01:01:24.740 --> 01:01:28.180]   And he sent them takedowns and they were very feet dragging.
[01:01:28.180 --> 01:01:29.180]   Oh, this is good.
[01:01:29.180 --> 01:01:30.420]   They're genuinely lousy about it.
[01:01:30.420 --> 01:01:33.780]   So that's relevant because the thing that protects them is the fact that they have a
[01:01:33.780 --> 01:01:36.780]   DMCA takedown procedure, but they've got to stay.
[01:01:36.780 --> 01:01:37.780]   You got to respond.
[01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:38.780]   We got to respond.
[01:01:38.780 --> 01:01:40.040]   The lip service about it.
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:42.860]   But, but on the flip side, like there's so much legitimate data.
[01:01:42.860 --> 01:01:44.320]   People just going to get a look.
[01:01:44.320 --> 01:01:45.320]   Well, here's there.
[01:01:45.320 --> 01:01:48.040]   I think there's a connection between the throttling and the mega upload story and that
[01:01:48.040 --> 01:01:51.840]   it is about data and it's about what's been promised and about what's possible.
[01:01:51.840 --> 01:01:53.440]   So the throttling, we were joking around.
[01:01:53.440 --> 01:01:54.540]   It doesn't really affect us.
[01:01:54.540 --> 01:01:55.540]   Doesn't really affect us.
[01:01:55.540 --> 01:01:56.540]   It does affect Brian.
[01:01:56.540 --> 01:01:57.540]   Yes.
[01:01:57.540 --> 01:02:01.300]   And we, you know, to adjust a promise after you've signed a contract.
[01:02:01.300 --> 01:02:02.300]   Sure.
[01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:03.300]   Right.
[01:02:03.300 --> 01:02:04.300]   And committed funds.
[01:02:04.300 --> 01:02:05.300]   I agree.
[01:02:05.300 --> 01:02:06.300]   Is that's wrong.
[01:02:06.300 --> 01:02:07.300]   That's wrong.
[01:02:07.300 --> 01:02:08.300]   That's wrong.
[01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:09.860]   And I felt like doing it.
[01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:10.860]   And now I've done it.
[01:02:10.860 --> 01:02:11.860]   The podcast.
[01:02:11.860 --> 01:02:13.500]   So take it with Baratou Datherston.
[01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:14.500]   That was Dasterdly.
[01:02:14.500 --> 01:02:15.500]   Dasterdly.
[01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:19.140]   So in any seven, seven, seven, eight, the crowd goes wild.
[01:02:19.140 --> 01:02:20.140]   He said it.
[01:02:20.140 --> 01:02:23.180]   I do think, you know, there is a signal that we don't have true competition because no
[01:02:23.180 --> 01:02:24.940]   one is, no one can offer.
[01:02:24.940 --> 01:02:25.940]   Absolutely.
[01:02:25.940 --> 01:02:26.940]   We can offer that.
[01:02:26.940 --> 01:02:29.820]   And then same in the, in the mega upload case, you know, there are people who are going to
[01:02:29.820 --> 01:02:34.380]   lose their files and you can have legitimate files, not pirated files.
[01:02:34.380 --> 01:02:38.420]   You need a mega backup for the backup.
[01:02:38.420 --> 01:02:39.900]   You know, people have trusted their service.
[01:02:39.900 --> 01:02:43.740]   And I'm sure if you read the fine print, it said if we're rated by people for doing
[01:02:43.740 --> 01:02:45.900]   things, we shouldn't do all your stuff gone.
[01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:46.900]   They say that.
[01:02:46.900 --> 01:02:50.260]   They say you should be, you should have, you should not keep your only copy on us.
[01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:55.180]   So two companies have been hosting for them in the US, Carpathia hosting in Virginia.
[01:02:55.180 --> 01:02:56.180]   Carpathia?
[01:02:56.180 --> 01:02:57.180]   Carpathia.
[01:02:57.180 --> 01:02:58.180]   Okay.
[01:02:58.180 --> 01:03:00.820]   So I don't know if this is common or not, but I read the left behind series, the stories
[01:03:00.820 --> 01:03:03.980]   of the Rapture and this is fictionalized account of the book of Revelations.
[01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:06.460]   And the name of the Antichrist in this series,
[01:03:06.460 --> 01:03:07.460]   Carpathia.
[01:03:07.460 --> 01:03:08.460]   Nikolai Carpathia.
[01:03:08.460 --> 01:03:10.220]   Yeah, I think that's, I think there's other meanings.
[01:03:10.220 --> 01:03:12.340]   I'm just saying maybe mega uploads all I say.
[01:03:12.340 --> 01:03:14.140]   Maybe it's all hosted by the Antichrist.
[01:03:14.140 --> 01:03:15.140]   That's evil.
[01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:16.140]   Why not?
[01:03:16.140 --> 01:03:19.420]   That might be a reason to have some doubts about the sanctity of your data.
[01:03:19.420 --> 01:03:20.940]   Why, we gave you head over there.
[01:03:20.940 --> 01:03:22.220]   What is going on?
[01:03:22.220 --> 01:03:27.660]   This is, this is the worst rat hole I have ever gone down.
[01:03:27.660 --> 01:03:29.180]   Also I don't know what you're going to make of this.
[01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:31.420]   The other company is Cogent community.
[01:03:31.420 --> 01:03:32.420]   I've heard of Cogent.
[01:03:32.420 --> 01:03:33.420]   I've heard of that just made up.
[01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:35.300]   Cogent was God.
[01:03:35.300 --> 01:03:36.980]   But they leave servers to mega upload.
[01:03:36.980 --> 01:03:40.940]   They no longer have an obligation to preserve those servers.
[01:03:40.940 --> 01:03:46.140]   They're saying as soon as Thursday, we're just going to erase those drives and start over.
[01:03:46.140 --> 01:03:49.300]   And by the way, do not contact us.
[01:03:49.300 --> 01:03:50.300]   Contact mega upload.
[01:03:50.300 --> 01:03:51.300]   Don't call us.
[01:03:51.300 --> 01:03:52.300]   I'll tell you.
[01:03:52.300 --> 01:03:54.140]   I mean, I guess, I guess all we could take from this is a lesson.
[01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:57.060]   Like, I mean, none of us are really, I don't, I don't see how this could have gone any other
[01:03:57.060 --> 01:03:58.060]   way.
[01:03:58.060 --> 01:03:59.060]   Trust not the cloud.
[01:03:59.060 --> 01:04:00.060]   Yeah.
[01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:01.060]   Yeah.
[01:04:01.060 --> 01:04:04.660]   And we'll look back at this weird period of time on the internet where it's like, yeah,
[01:04:04.660 --> 01:04:06.340]   remember when all your stuff could just disappear?
[01:04:06.340 --> 01:04:07.340]   That was weird.
[01:04:07.340 --> 01:04:12.140]   You know, for like seven years where we didn't actually pay attention, where we didn't take
[01:04:12.140 --> 01:04:16.060]   backups and redundancy seriously, where we didn't demand a level of accountability from
[01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:20.140]   our service providers and enforcement of the promises they made us as paying customers.
[01:04:20.140 --> 01:04:23.860]   And we'll look back and say, yeah, that was a, that was a dark time in the web where we
[01:04:23.860 --> 01:04:28.180]   had no certainty about anything and we didn't care until we lost it all.
[01:04:28.180 --> 01:04:29.180]   Yeah.
[01:04:29.180 --> 01:04:33.980]   And so the Carpathian Mountains is a range of mountains forming an arc roughly 1500 kilometers
[01:04:33.980 --> 01:04:35.700]   long across central and eastern Europe.
[01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:37.700]   It is not the antichrist.
[01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:40.540]   Oh, you have not proven that at all.
[01:04:40.540 --> 01:04:46.780]   Just you just stated that they were not an absolute rebuttal to my assertion.
[01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:49.780]   You also didn't read the full Wikipedia, which I haven't finished editing yet.
[01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:53.460]   You should add that line at the end and also a home of the antichrist.
[01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:58.260]   And I'd also like to point out that Vigo the Carpathian was the bad guy from those
[01:04:58.260 --> 01:04:59.260]   posters too.
[01:04:59.260 --> 01:05:00.260]   That's right.
[01:05:00.260 --> 01:05:01.260]   Not a coincidence.
[01:05:01.260 --> 01:05:03.100]   Did you get that from the chat room?
[01:05:03.100 --> 01:05:04.500]   No, I was just like that.
[01:05:04.500 --> 01:05:09.260]   I looked it up on Wikipedia to make sure someone in the chat room did point out mega
[01:05:09.260 --> 01:05:15.700]   retrieval.com for those, this is the EFF's effort to help those who had files with this
[01:05:15.700 --> 01:05:17.460]   company retrieve them.
[01:05:17.460 --> 01:05:19.980]   So mega retrieval.com EFF sponsored site.
[01:05:19.980 --> 01:05:28.220]   If you have been caught up in the copyright wars and then the aggressive deletion of data
[01:05:28.220 --> 01:05:31.020]   and all that all copyright infringing.
[01:05:31.020 --> 01:05:33.020]   So Carpathian is working with them.
[01:05:33.020 --> 01:05:34.020]   You should check out.
[01:05:34.020 --> 01:05:35.020]   I don't know how to do that.
[01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:36.020]   No, yeah.
[01:05:36.020 --> 01:05:41.460]   It says Carpathian has created this website to assist users in contacting the EFF.
[01:05:41.460 --> 01:05:42.460]   That's interesting.
[01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:45.060]   Well, you know, I love the EFF.
[01:05:45.060 --> 01:05:47.940]   I donate to them every month and that makes me.
[01:05:47.940 --> 01:05:51.620]   Yeah, EFF, ACLU, like these are critical organizations.
[01:05:51.620 --> 01:05:56.420]   Well, let's talk about something that was very controversial and became a big cause
[01:05:56.420 --> 01:05:58.220]   of the celebrity on Facebook.
[01:05:58.220 --> 01:05:59.180]   And we're talking about the Susan G.
[01:05:59.180 --> 01:06:00.180]   Common Foundation.
[01:06:00.180 --> 01:06:01.460]   We'll do that in just a minute.
[01:06:01.460 --> 01:06:04.100]   But first a word from our friends.
[01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:10.260]   It's Citrix who make go to meeting the ultimate in online collaboration software.
[01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:15.100]   You know, for years go to meeting has had the fastest, easiest, most secure screen sharing
[01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:16.620]   solution out there.
[01:06:16.620 --> 01:06:19.220]   Now they've got video to HD faces.
[01:06:19.220 --> 01:06:22.020]   They've just added it and it is incredible.
[01:06:22.020 --> 01:06:25.180]   It makes such a difference to people to see the person you're meeting with.
[01:06:25.180 --> 01:06:29.060]   Whether it's a new client, a colleague that you don't get together with very often to
[01:06:29.060 --> 01:06:31.100]   see their faces, their reactions.
[01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:32.900]   It's actually how we as humans work.
[01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:38.620]   We make connections face to face and go to meeting with HD faces really brings that to
[01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:39.980]   the online world.
[01:06:39.980 --> 01:06:44.060]   All it takes is a webcam and a click and you'll be collaborating an HD video like that.
[01:06:44.060 --> 01:06:49.180]   You'll see your attendees eye to eye while collaborating on documents in real time.
[01:06:49.180 --> 01:06:50.460]   You'll feel instantly connected.
[01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:52.100]   It's great for training for me.
[01:06:52.100 --> 01:06:55.860]   We don't do a meeting, a teleconference without having go to meeting running.
[01:06:55.860 --> 01:06:58.180]   Well, that's one of the nice things about it by the way.
[01:06:58.180 --> 01:07:00.180]   It gives you a teleconference bridge.
[01:07:00.180 --> 01:07:01.580]   You could use VoIP or phone.
[01:07:01.580 --> 01:07:03.180]   So that's part of the setup.
[01:07:03.180 --> 01:07:06.140]   So you do hear people and if they've got a camera you see them too.
[01:07:06.140 --> 01:07:07.140]   You could try this.
[01:07:07.140 --> 01:07:08.140]   You don't have to take my word for you.
[01:07:08.140 --> 01:07:09.140]   You could try it absolutely free.
[01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:11.460]   Go to go to meeting.com.
[01:07:11.460 --> 01:07:15.900]   Click the orange try it free button and use the offer code to it.
[01:07:15.900 --> 01:07:20.380]   If you want to know more while you're at the site, just run the video on HD video conferencing.
[01:07:20.380 --> 01:07:21.380]   This is all vouch for it.
[01:07:21.380 --> 01:07:22.380]   This is how high quality it is.
[01:07:22.380 --> 01:07:27.580]   So do you want to know one reason to definitely involve faces is how many people have been
[01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:29.980]   on a meeting that goes 30, 40 minutes.
[01:07:29.980 --> 01:07:30.980]   You're so tuned out.
[01:07:30.980 --> 01:07:31.980]   Oh yeah.
[01:07:31.980 --> 01:07:32.980]   People are talking.
[01:07:32.980 --> 01:07:33.980]   You're playing a bit older or whatever.
[01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:34.980]   It's really true.
[01:07:34.980 --> 01:07:36.460]   It's like now you at least you know they're engaged.
[01:07:36.460 --> 01:07:37.460]   You'll probably shorten the length.
[01:07:37.460 --> 01:07:39.140]   Oh, in the lawn I don't have.
[01:07:39.140 --> 01:07:40.980]   Exactly playing Tetris.
[01:07:40.980 --> 01:07:41.980]   So that's the building up building.
[01:07:41.980 --> 01:07:46.940]   Go to meeting because then you'll bust me sitting there building roads and infrastructure
[01:07:46.940 --> 01:07:47.940]   for America.
[01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:48.940]   I do a lot of things when we'll conference calls.
[01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:49.940]   Do you really?
[01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:50.940]   Yeah.
[01:07:50.940 --> 01:07:51.940]   Go to AmeriCorps.
[01:07:51.940 --> 01:07:52.940]   Lie.
[01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:53.940]   Such a liar.
[01:07:53.940 --> 01:07:54.940]   Go to meeting.com.
[01:07:54.940 --> 01:07:58.620]   Use the offer code TWIT for 30 days unlimited use free.
[01:07:58.620 --> 01:08:02.420]   I'm telling you until you've tried it, you will not realize how incredible this is.
[01:08:02.420 --> 01:08:04.100]   Go to meeting.com.
[01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:08.780]   I have, you know, I've seen this story peripherally on my Facebook page.
[01:08:08.780 --> 01:08:10.220]   People very upset.
[01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:14.780]   The Susan G. Comin Foundation is the breast cancer, you know, the, what do they call it,
[01:08:14.780 --> 01:08:16.180]   the walk for the cure and all of that?
[01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:17.180]   The pink ribbon.
[01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:18.180]   The pink ribbon folks.
[01:08:18.180 --> 01:08:25.420]   And of course because of that really become beloved among women and people care about
[01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:26.420]   women.
[01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:27.420]   Yeah.
[01:08:27.420 --> 01:08:31.820]   But they made an announcement that they were going to pull funding from Planned Parenthood.
[01:08:31.820 --> 01:08:34.900]   Did they announce it or did it just come out that they were pulling?
[01:08:34.900 --> 01:08:36.100]   They announced it.
[01:08:36.100 --> 01:08:40.620]   They had made the decision a few months ago, revealed the decision earlier this week.
[01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:46.220]   So on Tuesday they said that their new funding criteria would restrict grants set aside for
[01:08:46.220 --> 01:08:47.460]   Planned Parenthood.
[01:08:47.460 --> 01:08:51.900]   These grants were to provide mammograms, which is absolutely critical in the detection and
[01:08:51.900 --> 01:08:57.940]   treatment of breast cancer, which is their cause for women, low income women.
[01:08:57.940 --> 01:09:01.180]   Planned Parenthood said it happened because they were getting pressure from any choice
[01:09:01.180 --> 01:09:02.180]   groups.
[01:09:02.180 --> 01:09:03.180]   Right.
[01:09:03.180 --> 01:09:06.380]   So and they had carved out this rule about basically we can't give money to groups under
[01:09:06.380 --> 01:09:08.100]   investigation.
[01:09:08.100 --> 01:09:11.380]   But the, if you look at all the groups they deal with and all the rule, the way that rule
[01:09:11.380 --> 01:09:14.260]   could have been written, it only applied to Planned Parenthood.
[01:09:14.260 --> 01:09:16.700]   It's one group out of the many that they deal with them.
[01:09:16.700 --> 01:09:18.580]   So it looked very political.
[01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:21.740]   I don't, in this show, necessarily want to get into the deep, deep politics.
[01:09:21.740 --> 01:09:23.100]   No, and that's not tech.
[01:09:23.100 --> 01:09:29.020]   But tech is how they literally, four days later, reversed their decision based entirely
[01:09:29.020 --> 01:09:30.380]   on Facebook and Twitter.
[01:09:30.380 --> 01:09:34.620]   And they, they, they got slammed in their reaction from all spheres.
[01:09:34.620 --> 01:09:39.860]   And it was, you know, I think Coleman had done a pretty great job, brand wise, of avoiding
[01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:45.140]   some of the hot button political turmoil around women's health in the country in general.
[01:09:45.140 --> 01:09:46.140]   It's tricky.
[01:09:46.140 --> 01:09:49.060]   It's a trick to buy people from all sorts of political stripes.
[01:09:49.060 --> 01:09:54.860]   When they made this announcement, they inserted themselves into a major culture war and incited
[01:09:54.860 --> 01:09:59.540]   another side in so doing, which is saying, well, if you're committed to reducing breast
[01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:02.580]   cancer among women, how could you take this funding?
[01:10:02.580 --> 01:10:07.260]   Planned Parenthood also bolstered by social media was funded heavily in reaction to this.
[01:10:07.260 --> 01:10:13.140]   Mayor Bloomberg wrote them a check for $250,000 and tweeted about how we have to maintain support
[01:10:13.140 --> 01:10:17.540]   for access to these screening processes among women who don't have access to it.
[01:10:17.540 --> 01:10:21.580]   So it just shows the power though, social media to pick up on a story quickly.
[01:10:21.580 --> 01:10:23.140]   Here comes Mr. Brushford.
[01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:24.140]   Yeah.
[01:10:24.140 --> 01:10:25.140]   Yeah.
[01:10:25.140 --> 01:10:29.180]   There, and first of all, I think this is a good story because it's, it's, it was an explosive
[01:10:29.180 --> 01:10:34.100]   showdown and in the end, you know, they reversed their decision, but there's something about
[01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:38.380]   when the internet gets its panties in a wad and just, and just they can't let go of it.
[01:10:38.380 --> 01:10:41.700]   It was like, it was just waiting for the witch hunt, you know, it's, it's go daddy sopa
[01:10:41.700 --> 01:10:42.700]   all over again.
[01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:45.300]   Like they like, well, go daddy, you support so well.
[01:10:45.300 --> 01:10:46.500]   You deserve that?
[01:10:46.500 --> 01:10:50.880]   Well, but then, but then once they fully, fully reverse their decision and did exactly
[01:10:50.880 --> 01:10:55.100]   what everybody asked them to do, they're like, yeah, but you're still, I hate your ads so
[01:10:55.100 --> 01:10:56.100]   much.
[01:10:56.100 --> 01:10:58.860]   It was the same thing with the Susan G. Covid.
[01:10:58.860 --> 01:10:59.860]   They reversed their decision.
[01:10:59.860 --> 01:11:03.140]   They did what they wanted to go like, yeah, but you're still jerks because you, well,
[01:11:03.140 --> 01:11:04.140]   like playing a character.
[01:11:04.140 --> 01:11:05.140]   All right.
[01:11:05.140 --> 01:11:07.420]   Let's put it on a, on a not, let's just put it on a personal level.
[01:11:07.420 --> 01:11:11.020]   If you did something dicky, that's already, I don't believe this.
[01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:15.340]   I said, I said, Brian, that was a really lousy thing to do.
[01:11:15.340 --> 01:11:16.340]   Right.
[01:11:16.340 --> 01:11:17.340]   And you said, oh, you're right.
[01:11:17.340 --> 01:11:18.340]   I'm sorry I stopped.
[01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:20.340]   I might still hold it against you for a little while.
[01:11:20.340 --> 01:11:21.340]   Yeah.
[01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:22.340]   Yeah.
[01:11:22.340 --> 01:11:23.900]   Because you had the initial dicky impulse.
[01:11:23.900 --> 01:11:24.900]   Right.
[01:11:24.900 --> 01:11:25.900]   But then that would make you a dickie.
[01:11:25.900 --> 01:11:26.900]   So it's okay.
[01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:29.340]   I just, I love this again.
[01:11:29.340 --> 01:11:30.340]   Personal.
[01:11:30.340 --> 01:11:34.260]   I mean, I don't think you, I, isn't that normal human behavior to hold it against you
[01:11:34.260 --> 01:11:35.260]   for a little bit.
[01:11:35.260 --> 01:11:39.660]   Once you make a correction, once you do what it is, it doesn't make it all right.
[01:11:39.660 --> 01:11:43.300]   But it doesn't, but it changes it to where now you're the, like, like, if I say to my
[01:11:43.300 --> 01:11:44.660]   daughter, you got to clean your room.
[01:11:44.660 --> 01:11:46.580]   Your room's messy and she cleans it up.
[01:11:46.580 --> 01:11:48.880]   And then I'm like, yeah, your room was messy though.
[01:11:48.880 --> 01:11:51.780]   And that was kind of, you're kind of bad because you used to have her messy room.
[01:11:51.780 --> 01:11:52.780]   There's degrees.
[01:11:52.780 --> 01:11:57.100]   It's, but if you, okay, let's say you murdered somebody.
[01:11:57.100 --> 01:11:58.820]   And then you said you were sorry.
[01:11:58.820 --> 01:12:02.820]   Am I supposed to say, see, the Christian thing to do is to say, oh, he's repented.
[01:12:02.820 --> 01:12:04.220]   He's okay.
[01:12:04.220 --> 01:12:08.140]   But some people might not be really great Christians and might say, you're an asshole.
[01:12:08.140 --> 01:12:09.140]   Right.
[01:12:09.140 --> 01:12:10.140]   You murdered somebody.
[01:12:10.140 --> 01:12:13.020]   And even though you apologized, I'm not going to forgive you.
[01:12:13.020 --> 01:12:14.820]   I don't want to drink that.
[01:12:14.820 --> 01:12:16.820]   That's just, we've gotten to murder.
[01:12:16.820 --> 01:12:19.900]   Well, though, but that's the point is it's not necessarily a messy room.
[01:12:19.900 --> 01:12:21.700]   It's somewhere in between murder and a messy room.
[01:12:21.700 --> 01:12:26.060]   Well, and I'll tell you, I, I felt a line with the show.
[01:12:26.060 --> 01:12:31.140]   Between murder and a messy room is, I'm just saying that I understand why after all that
[01:12:31.140 --> 01:12:33.940]   backlash, people don't necessarily immediately fill us.
[01:12:33.940 --> 01:12:35.820]   I don't, I don't, I haven't forgiven GoDaddy.
[01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:39.140]   I think that that was a cynical retraction on their own.
[01:12:39.140 --> 01:12:40.980]   I think they did support SOPA.
[01:12:40.980 --> 01:12:42.580]   And then they realized, oh, it's going to hurt us.
[01:12:42.580 --> 01:12:44.300]   Oh, let's be, let's cynically retract it.
[01:12:44.300 --> 01:12:45.500]   I'm still not forgiving them.
[01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:46.500]   Right.
[01:12:46.500 --> 01:12:47.500]   Susan G. Comen, I haven't really decided.
[01:12:47.500 --> 01:12:48.700]   I have to read more about that.
[01:12:48.700 --> 01:12:49.700]   Yeah.
[01:12:49.700 --> 01:12:52.500]   Actually, the backlash really is now against their vice president who apparently makes
[01:12:52.500 --> 01:12:54.460]   a huge amount of money.
[01:12:54.460 --> 01:12:58.740]   Um, anyway, so, so there's, there's, there's more to this story.
[01:12:58.740 --> 01:12:59.740]   I think it's human.
[01:12:59.740 --> 01:13:00.740]   Not to forgive immediately.
[01:13:00.740 --> 01:13:04.460]   Well, if, if it is human, then we're getting back to an argument you and I had earlier in
[01:13:04.460 --> 01:13:07.500]   the show, Brian, about the way things are versus the way things should be.
[01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:08.500]   Right.
[01:13:08.500 --> 01:13:09.500]   And so in this case, now I'm the idea.
[01:13:09.500 --> 01:13:10.500]   Yeah.
[01:13:10.500 --> 01:13:11.500]   Right.
[01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:12.500]   Can't you guys just let her go?
[01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:13.500]   The thing which you all are, we should be more forgiving.
[01:13:13.500 --> 01:13:16.500]   And I'm like, but we're not, but we should be, but we're not.
[01:13:16.500 --> 01:13:17.500]   We should be, but we're not.
[01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:19.420]   Hey, let's talk about the Super Bowl.
[01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:20.660]   It's coming up in just a few minutes.
[01:13:20.660 --> 01:13:22.140]   Never heard of it.
[01:13:22.140 --> 01:13:23.140]   It's already started.
[01:13:23.140 --> 01:13:24.140]   All right.
[01:13:24.140 --> 01:13:25.140]   This shows over.
[01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:29.940]   When I was, is the first super bowl of the most radical discussion right now.
[01:13:29.940 --> 01:13:30.940]   Oh my God.
[01:13:30.940 --> 01:13:33.420]   We should, we should like propose like the most idiotic ideas ever.
[01:13:33.420 --> 01:13:34.420]   No one, no one will hear.
[01:13:34.420 --> 01:13:35.580]   Nobody's watching anymore.
[01:13:35.580 --> 01:13:37.100]   No, actually a lot of.
[01:13:37.100 --> 01:13:40.780]   So then when I killed the whole loaf.
[01:13:40.780 --> 01:13:43.020]   Oh, the serve to be killed.
[01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:45.540]   I just, I can't do it.
[01:13:45.540 --> 01:13:46.540]   I can't.
[01:13:46.540 --> 01:13:47.540]   Come on.
[01:13:47.540 --> 01:13:50.780]   Super Bowls being streamed for the first time.
[01:13:50.780 --> 01:13:52.420]   Big deal now if you're on a mobile platform.
[01:13:52.420 --> 01:13:53.420]   Actually, it is a big deal.
[01:13:53.420 --> 01:13:57.060]   And there's also a giant crackdown on all the illegal streams.
[01:13:57.060 --> 01:14:02.340]   107 sports related domains have been seized by the feds.
[01:14:02.340 --> 01:14:05.940]   A 16 of them allegedly engaged in streaming.
[01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:06.940]   There is.
[01:14:06.940 --> 01:14:08.700]   The rest accused of selling fake merchandise.
[01:14:08.700 --> 01:14:12.860]   You see, now I liked what the guy in charge of rovio angry birds guy said.
[01:14:12.860 --> 01:14:13.860]   Okay.
[01:14:13.860 --> 01:14:16.640]   Because I tell you, I'm what you walk down the streets of any major city and you'll see
[01:14:16.640 --> 01:14:18.100]   angry birds hats.
[01:14:18.100 --> 01:14:19.500]   You know those are not approved.
[01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:20.500]   I authorized.
[01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:21.740]   Those are not, they didn't go to rovio.
[01:14:21.740 --> 01:14:23.420]   It's like, I have the license to make this happen.
[01:14:23.420 --> 01:14:24.420]   I'm sure they're making some money.
[01:14:24.420 --> 01:14:26.140]   May I have a license to advertise your product for you?
[01:14:26.140 --> 01:14:27.140]   That's what the guy rovio said.
[01:14:27.140 --> 01:14:28.540]   He says, I don't have a problem with that.
[01:14:28.540 --> 01:14:29.860]   That's free publicity.
[01:14:29.860 --> 01:14:31.100]   You know, we license stuff.
[01:14:31.100 --> 01:14:34.740]   We try to do, you know, but I am not going to go around and find everybody who's making
[01:14:34.740 --> 01:14:36.700]   angry birds hats and try to put them.
[01:14:36.700 --> 01:14:41.380]   Well, let me, let me add another twist to it, which is sports teams are such a part of
[01:14:41.380 --> 01:14:46.180]   the society and they're people feel an ownership over them well more than angry birds because
[01:14:46.180 --> 01:14:51.500]   they have the city's name on them because they use public funds to subsidize their stadiums
[01:14:51.500 --> 01:14:54.460]   and get all these preferential bonds and financing.
[01:14:54.460 --> 01:14:55.460]   I agree.
[01:14:55.460 --> 01:15:00.340]   So lure these teams to towns and make an excuse to get rights of public way and things like
[01:15:00.340 --> 01:15:01.340]   that.
[01:15:01.340 --> 01:15:03.780]   So it's not just some private enterprise.
[01:15:03.780 --> 01:15:08.060]   The league exists as a testament to this idea of American civilization and culture and
[01:15:08.060 --> 01:15:10.500]   the Dallas Cowboys and the New York Giants and the region.
[01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:11.500]   But it isn't really.
[01:15:11.500 --> 01:15:12.500]   Patriot.
[01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:13.500]   It is not really.
[01:15:13.500 --> 01:15:15.580]   But I think, but when you look at the funds that the public funds that do go to support
[01:15:15.580 --> 01:15:17.060]   it, it's corporate welfare.
[01:15:17.060 --> 01:15:18.060]   It's not.
[01:15:18.060 --> 01:15:19.060]   Oh my God.
[01:15:19.060 --> 01:15:20.060]   It's the worst.
[01:15:20.060 --> 01:15:21.060]   It's the worst corporate.
[01:15:21.060 --> 01:15:24.420]   So you're going to demand that the citizens like fork over cash to build you a stadium, but
[01:15:24.420 --> 01:15:28.820]   you're going to prosecute them for supporting the team that resides in that stadium.
[01:15:28.820 --> 01:15:31.140]   Well, so here's the difference this year over previous years.
[01:15:31.140 --> 01:15:35.060]   If I heard this story last year, I'd be all up in arms and angry about it.
[01:15:35.060 --> 01:15:37.460]   The taking down of all those domains that are illegally streaming.
[01:15:37.460 --> 01:15:38.460]   The streaming.
[01:15:38.460 --> 01:15:43.180]   But because this is the first year that there is a legitimate stream, then I'm kind of okay
[01:15:43.180 --> 01:15:44.180]   with that.
[01:15:44.180 --> 01:15:46.340]   I still think it's douchey on behalf of the NFL.
[01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:47.340]   Like what's the matter?
[01:15:47.340 --> 01:15:49.060]   You guys don't have enough eyeballs on the friggin Super Bowl.
[01:15:49.060 --> 01:15:50.500]   You do want to sit down.
[01:15:50.500 --> 01:15:51.500]   I agree with you.
[01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:55.540]   When the iTunes started selling music, I was much less okay with pirating music.
[01:15:55.540 --> 01:15:56.540]   Yes, exactly.
[01:15:56.540 --> 01:15:57.540]   So I feel the same way.
[01:15:57.540 --> 01:16:02.300]   But I'll tell you, there is a lot of emerging spaces where the needs and wants and desires
[01:16:02.300 --> 01:16:04.180]   of the customer are not being met.
[01:16:04.180 --> 01:16:08.740]   And you can't get angry when piracy occurs to fill a lack of service.
[01:16:08.740 --> 01:16:09.740]   I agree.
[01:16:09.740 --> 01:16:13.660]   So when the Beatles or let's the Rolling Stones won't let their stuff be sold digitally, I
[01:16:13.660 --> 01:16:14.900]   don't really feel too bad.
[01:16:14.900 --> 01:16:17.780]   Well, they're telling people find it.
[01:16:17.780 --> 01:16:18.780]   And it's all.
[01:16:18.780 --> 01:16:19.780]   They're basically saying steal this.
[01:16:19.780 --> 01:16:20.780]   Steal this record.
[01:16:20.780 --> 01:16:26.100]   In a less screw you kind of piracy, you have like a, to me, a real gray area is bootlegs.
[01:16:26.100 --> 01:16:30.660]   Is bootlegs of a concert of Grateful Dead, you know, of this particular performance at
[01:16:30.660 --> 01:16:31.660]   this date?
[01:16:31.660 --> 01:16:34.260]   There are people who love to collect every single bit of those and they're just not
[01:16:34.260 --> 01:16:35.260]   available.
[01:16:35.260 --> 01:16:36.260]   They're on board.
[01:16:36.260 --> 01:16:37.260]   They're on board.
[01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:38.260]   They're on board.
[01:16:38.260 --> 01:16:39.260]   They're not.
[01:16:39.260 --> 01:16:40.260]   People would have bought it otherwise.
[01:16:40.260 --> 01:16:41.260]   It's their hoarding.
[01:16:41.260 --> 01:16:42.740]   And just to clarify, like, I think I'm with you on the streaming.
[01:16:42.740 --> 01:16:46.780]   I was talking particularly about the merchandising and the cracking down these unauthorized sales
[01:16:46.780 --> 01:16:52.340]   of paraphernalia, but the streaming, especially if they're streaming is good, one, they should
[01:16:52.340 --> 01:16:54.020]   just win in the market.
[01:16:54.020 --> 01:16:55.020]   Yes, absolutely.
[01:16:55.020 --> 01:16:56.580]   They should just be more actually.
[01:16:56.580 --> 01:17:00.620]   They're probably stealing the stream from NFL.com and rebroadcasting, right?
[01:17:00.620 --> 01:17:03.220]   Or they've got a carol owned at a TV set.
[01:17:03.220 --> 01:17:04.220]   Yeah.
[01:17:04.220 --> 01:17:05.220]   Well, I'll tell you, like, I went through this recently.
[01:17:05.220 --> 01:17:08.500]   I had a bit of a moral conundrum because I wanted to see the new episodes of Sherlock
[01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:10.500]   on the BBC for a season was amazing.
[01:17:10.500 --> 01:17:11.500]   I know.
[01:17:11.500 --> 01:17:13.300]   They're not going to be here in America for three more months.
[01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:14.300]   Right.
[01:17:14.300 --> 01:17:15.300]   And so, and me, there is a player.
[01:17:15.300 --> 01:17:19.660]   If you, if you, there's BitTorrent, but then there's also the BBC iMovie player has them
[01:17:19.660 --> 01:17:22.660]   all streaming, but you go there, like, oh, sorry, you're, you're the state.
[01:17:22.660 --> 01:17:24.380]   You're one of our colonies.
[01:17:24.380 --> 01:17:25.380]   Exactly.
[01:17:25.380 --> 01:17:30.020]   And so, but then I, I used a VPN to pretend I'm from London and all of a sudden it played
[01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:31.020]   instantly.
[01:17:31.020 --> 01:17:32.540]   So it's like, now you're a British loyalist.
[01:17:32.540 --> 01:17:33.540]   Yes, of course.
[01:17:33.540 --> 01:17:34.540]   Interesting.
[01:17:34.540 --> 01:17:35.540]   Okay.
[01:17:35.540 --> 01:17:36.540]   I'm going to pay my taxes.
[01:17:36.540 --> 01:17:40.300]   I'm a plate devil advocate because in Britain, that production, it's a BBC One production, was
[01:17:40.300 --> 01:17:43.940]   financed by license fees from people in Britain.
[01:17:43.940 --> 01:17:44.940]   Right.
[01:17:44.940 --> 01:17:46.420]   Of which you are decidedly not.
[01:17:46.420 --> 01:17:49.100]   The people to take care of most of them from England.
[01:17:49.100 --> 01:17:50.100]   And you want a free ride.
[01:17:50.100 --> 01:17:51.100]   You want a free ride.
[01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:53.420]   On all the people in the UK who paid their TV license fees.
[01:17:53.420 --> 01:17:54.420]   You're a free rider.
[01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:57.100]   But, well, I can't deny that.
[01:17:57.100 --> 01:18:01.900]   So, no, I mean, the answer is BBC offer it so we can buy it.
[01:18:01.900 --> 01:18:02.900]   And then we won't be free.
[01:18:02.900 --> 01:18:04.140]   Give us a chance to pay for it.
[01:18:04.140 --> 01:18:05.940]   Weirdly, like, I felt dirty.
[01:18:05.940 --> 01:18:09.200]   I got as far as installing the BitTorrent and starting to download it and I felt dirty
[01:18:09.200 --> 01:18:10.200]   about that.
[01:18:10.200 --> 01:18:11.700]   And so then I switched over to the VPN.
[01:18:11.700 --> 01:18:13.900]   And I felt less bad because they're still getting the view.
[01:18:13.900 --> 01:18:14.900]   They're still showing the advertisements.
[01:18:14.900 --> 01:18:16.380]   That's a good point.
[01:18:16.380 --> 01:18:19.980]   So the only thing is that my body is physically not located in London.
[01:18:19.980 --> 01:18:21.860]   Well, and there are two differences.
[01:18:21.860 --> 01:18:26.580]   There's the cost of that stream is incrementally probably low.
[01:18:26.580 --> 01:18:28.740]   I mailed two pennies to the government.
[01:18:28.740 --> 01:18:33.060]   But, you know, if they offered it and why can't they offer probably some legal thing
[01:18:33.060 --> 01:18:35.820]   that doesn't acknowledge the network world we live in.
[01:18:35.820 --> 01:18:37.380]   They have started making it like they are global.
[01:18:37.380 --> 01:18:38.940]   I mean, but I think this is, you're right.
[01:18:38.940 --> 01:18:40.020]   There may be some issues there.
[01:18:40.020 --> 01:18:43.980]   And that's one of the problems that we don't have a global structure to make this possible.
[01:18:43.980 --> 01:18:45.500]   That's really the government.
[01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:48.580]   We need to be, man, now you're bringing it.
[01:18:48.580 --> 01:18:49.580]   Wait a minute.
[01:18:49.580 --> 01:18:50.580]   We're getting that.
[01:18:50.580 --> 01:18:51.580]   It's called Facebook.
[01:18:51.580 --> 01:18:52.580]   They've got a currency.
[01:18:52.580 --> 01:18:53.580]   No, I do.
[01:18:53.580 --> 01:18:55.380]   I think about websites as different citizen ships.
[01:18:55.380 --> 01:18:58.420]   And it's like there are certain things like I just don't want to be bothered to have to
[01:18:58.420 --> 01:19:02.180]   give another login and become a citizen of yet another social network.
[01:19:02.180 --> 01:19:03.820]   That's part of the reason I've been dragging my feet on path.
[01:19:03.820 --> 01:19:05.300]   I know everyone's using path and loves it.
[01:19:05.300 --> 01:19:06.780]   But I'm just like, ah, not everyone.
[01:19:06.780 --> 01:19:07.780]   Two million people to be.
[01:19:07.780 --> 01:19:08.780]   Two million.
[01:19:08.780 --> 01:19:11.860]   Well, since they relaunched two months ago, I'm one of them and I love it.

[01:19:14.380 --> 01:19:17.780]   That means you just made people not want to sign up for Pat.
[01:19:17.780 --> 01:19:18.780]   You just lost a cut.
[01:19:18.780 --> 01:19:19.780]   You ought to see my son.
[01:19:19.780 --> 01:19:22.140]   This is really a tough time.
[01:19:22.140 --> 01:19:23.140]   So uncomfortable.
[01:19:23.140 --> 01:19:26.060]   In fact, this would be a good time to wrap this thing up and go watch a football game.

[01:20:16.100 --> 01:20:17.100]   Kind of math.
[01:20:17.100 --> 01:20:18.100]   Is that your thing?
[01:20:18.100 --> 01:20:19.100]   It was.
