[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.320]   Virtually by a phone because that's the medium he loves the most.
[00:01:12.320 --> 00:01:15.120]   Mr. Steve Gilmore of the News Gang and the Gilmore Gang.
[00:01:15.120 --> 00:01:15.640]   Hi Steve.
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:16.760]   Hi, how are you today?
[00:01:16.760 --> 00:01:18.200]   Great to have you on.
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:18.760]   Likewise.
[00:01:18.760 --> 00:01:21.800]   We tried Skype, we tried video, but you know Steve,
[00:01:21.800 --> 00:01:23.240]   you're just a phone guy.
[00:01:23.240 --> 00:01:28.080]   I just don't come across the big phone.
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:29.800]   I just love getting you on.
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:30.640]   We're glad we got you on.
[00:01:30.640 --> 00:01:34.320]   You've had some really great Gilmore Gangs and News Gangs lately,
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.560]   especially the conversation that you started about friend feed I think is very interesting.
[00:01:38.560 --> 00:01:41.800]   We'll get to that and talk about that in just a little bit.
[00:01:41.800 --> 00:01:47.080]   You also had Google, the guy in charge of Search at Google on.
[00:01:47.080 --> 00:01:49.240]   Was that just yesterday, the day before?
[00:01:49.240 --> 00:01:51.240]   He's not the guy in charge of Search.
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:58.200]   He's Mark Lukoski, who was the guy who was the architect of Hail Storm.
[00:01:58.200 --> 00:01:58.800]   Remember that?
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:59.840]   Hail Storm, that's right.
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:00.280]   Yeah.
[00:02:00.280 --> 00:02:04.440]   And now he's over running the APIs at Google.
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.400]   Yeah, I haven't listened to it yet, but I can't wait.
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.160]   It's on my iPod.
[00:02:07.160 --> 00:02:08.800]   I'm looking forward to that.
[00:02:08.800 --> 00:02:13.040]   Also here with us, Mr. Patrick Norton, of course, of Tekzilla fame,
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:17.040]   the most listened to show on revision 3.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:18.040]   Wow.
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:21.280]   That and $2.00 is a value.
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:24.080]   Thank you for the skill.
[00:02:24.080 --> 00:02:25.880]   Great to have you aboard.
[00:02:25.880 --> 00:02:29.520]   You and Veronica getting along as well as you and I did on the screen savers?
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:32.000]   Veronica's fun.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   She's smart.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   She's witty.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   She's charming.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   She's knowledgeable.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.840]   She loves getting hands on with stuff.
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.200]   And she gets you jokes.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:41.000]   Yes, actually.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.800]   And she's actually got a punk rock history.
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:48.320]   So she'll even understand some of the stuff I'm humming in between.
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:51.040]   Oh, so she's a vlogging Molly's fan too, huh?
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.680]   She's a dropkick Murphy's fan.
[00:02:52.680 --> 00:02:53.680]   Dropkick Murphy's.
[00:02:53.680 --> 00:02:54.680]   Yes.
[00:02:54.680 --> 00:02:56.120]   One of your favorites, Leon.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:02:57.120]   Yeah, wow.
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.640]   You are a superhero.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:01.040]   It's a classic.
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:04.120]   Also here, Stoken up right now on Brain Tonic.
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:05.120]   Mr. Randall Schwartz.
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:08.880]   It's great to have Randall in actually in studio with us.
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:10.080]   You like the Brain Tonic?
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:11.760]   It's actually a decent taste.
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.720]   I appreciate the best part about it.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:14.720]   It's free while I'm here.
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:15.720]   So this is really good.
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:16.720]   It is.
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.720]   With all the Brain Tonic.
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:18.720]   They're not a sponsor.
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:19.720]   We just drink their stuff.
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:20.960]   I don't know how that happened.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:23.000]   Randall is the author of this new book.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.360]   Let me plug something for you.
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:28.280]   It's called Pearls of Wisdom from Randall Schwartz, a press.
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:30.960]   And it's a great article about Pearl from many magazines.
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:34.520]   He also is the author of many great Pearl books, something like a dozen, including the
[00:03:34.520 --> 00:03:37.200]   classic learning Pearl, which everybody who starts with Pearl.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:42.240]   And now Randall is a completely abandoned Pearl in favor of Squeak.
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:43.240]   Is that what?
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:44.240]   You're Mr. Smalltalk now.
[00:03:44.240 --> 00:03:45.240]   The seaside web framework.
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:47.200]   I've been doing a lot of promotion for that.
[00:03:47.200 --> 00:03:48.400]   But I haven't totally been in Pearl.
[00:03:48.400 --> 00:03:52.440]   In fact, the last two weeks and next week I'm actually billing with Pearl Time.
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.240]   I actually have to pay the bills for a while.
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:55.640]   Can we mention the company that you're...
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:56.640]   No.
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:03:57.640]   No.
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:03:58.640]   Well, they won't allow me to do that otherwise I would.
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:00.720]   It's a really large company that ends in thatclamation mark.
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:01.720]   Let's just hear it at that.
[00:04:01.720 --> 00:04:02.720]   Oh, God.
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:03.720]   You just gave the...
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:04.720]   You think that really gave the show away.
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:05.720]   Can't believe that.
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.360]   I hope nobody's watching from Hotmail.
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:09.360]   Yeah.
[00:04:09.360 --> 00:04:10.360]   Exactly.
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:13.600]   So Randall is also the creator of the...
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.320]   Well, I wanted to say Geek Cruise's News, but you've changed the name.
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:22.120]   It's now the inside Cruise's News because Neil Bauman, the master Cruise master, has decided
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:24.720]   that the name inside Cruise's is more and fit for the modern generation.
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:25.720]   So we're going...
[00:04:25.720 --> 00:04:28.080]   I'm going on my next Geek Cruise won't be till next year, but I'm going to go to China
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:29.080]   with you.
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.080]   I know.
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:31.080]   I know how many and I am.
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:32.080]   Really looking.
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:33.080]   Right.
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.080]   It's going to be very cool.
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:35.080]   Good to have you along again.
[00:04:35.080 --> 00:04:36.080]   So I'm not going to Sweden.
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.080]   I thought I loved Sweden until I saw this story.
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:38.080]   The Swedish government.
[00:04:38.080 --> 00:04:44.260]   I don't know if this is kind of Patriot Act, Scandinavia, but they're moving towards...
[00:04:44.260 --> 00:04:49.960]   Very quickly towards a law that would take effect in January 2009 that would allow surveillance
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:58.320]   without court order, without any oversight of telephones, of internet access, of any electronic
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:01.480]   communications.
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:02.480]   This is kind of...
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.440]   Seems kind of backward for a country that seems very progressive.
[00:05:05.440 --> 00:05:12.240]   In fact, really, in some ways reminds me very much of what our government is up to.
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:15.520]   The government claims that the function of the surveillance program is to track email
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:18.680]   and phone conversations that cross the borders.
[00:05:18.680 --> 00:05:20.080]   That's exactly what the Patriot Act is.
[00:05:20.080 --> 00:05:24.240]   Well, we don't listen in unless you're talking to a foreign national.
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:29.440]   They also say, "Oh, this isn't going to encourage widespread domestic surveillance."
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:34.360]   But the fact is that all internet traffic originating Sweden ends up crossing the country's borders
[00:05:34.360 --> 00:05:36.280]   at some point.
[00:05:36.280 --> 00:05:41.320]   Even if it's email from a guy in Svensk to a guy in Stockholm, it's very likely going
[00:05:41.320 --> 00:05:44.040]   to go to servers that are somewhere else.
[00:05:44.040 --> 00:05:48.880]   And all mobile phones apparently are going across borders for tariff regulation reasons.
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:53.080]   It basically allows the government to watch everything that's going on domestically.
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:05:55.480]   Yeah, but think about it this way.
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:06:00.200]   One of the questions we're talking about next week on TechSIL is about a bunch of college
[00:06:00.200 --> 00:06:01.360]   kids have emailed.
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:05.080]   I'm traveling, I'm going to Europe, what should I do for an internet connection?
[00:06:05.080 --> 00:06:08.880]   And it's really funny, but after the bombings, it's not funny at all, actually.
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:15.360]   After the bombings in London, Italy put a law into effect so that anybody who is using
[00:06:15.360 --> 00:06:23.640]   an internet cafe has to, if they're a foreigner, has to produce a passport.
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:27.920]   And all of the internet cafe had to buy some fairly sophisticated tracking software so
[00:06:27.920 --> 00:06:34.600]   that specifically for the reason, so that you can correlate traffic in what would normally
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:39.680]   be an anonymous environment to an identity verified by a passport.
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.880]   But that anyway, that seems like that could have a very strong anti-t, I mean that seems
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:46.640]   makes sense, especially if you've got cafe bombings.
[00:06:46.640 --> 00:06:49.760]   Well, what's the real difference between that and...
[00:06:49.760 --> 00:06:51.680]   Well, it has to be a squeaking.
[00:06:51.680 --> 00:06:55.240]   I guess it could be, you don't have to be a foreign national for them to have to ask
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:56.240]   for a passport.
[00:06:56.240 --> 00:06:57.240]   True.
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:00.960]   Is Sweden really a capital of intellectual freedom?
[00:07:00.960 --> 00:07:03.640]   I don't know, I just like the food.
[00:07:03.640 --> 00:07:11.960]   I don't know, I just feel like they are, maybe not.
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:14.200]   Isn't that where Pirate Bay is?
[00:07:14.200 --> 00:07:15.200]   Or is it normal?
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:17.040]   It's in there, it's up there.
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.040]   Somewhere up there.
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:19.040]   We're just showing our internet raises.
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:27.080]   Didn't the issue that, you know, these pirates all make sense in terms of trying to
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:32.600]   protect ourselves against evil doers, but they also impinge on rights?
[00:07:32.600 --> 00:07:33.600]   Well, exactly.
[00:07:33.600 --> 00:07:34.600]   It's that...
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.520]   Any idea about the freedoms for the promise of security and discipline?
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:39.520]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:40.520]   Yeah.
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:42.880]   And I have personal experience with that being a bad issue.
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.680]   I mean, there are laws that are very broad and very vague that are already on the books
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:50.960]   that, like for example, in Oregon, pretty much using a computer for anything is illegal.
[00:07:50.960 --> 00:07:51.960]   And...
[00:07:51.960 --> 00:07:55.120]   Wait a minute, wait a minute, what do you mean?
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:58.120]   You're saying I'm using a computer for anything at all?
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:00.440]   Because you can redefine what authorized me to any levels.
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:01.440]   No, I say levels.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:02.440]   And because this is without authorization.
[00:08:02.440 --> 00:08:03.440]   Well, these badly written.
[00:08:03.440 --> 00:08:04.440]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:05.440]   The laws are completely badly written.
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.440]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:07.440]   That makes a lot of sense.
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.440]   But that's also true for many laws in the US who are related about computers.
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:10.360]   And they say, well, we're only going to use this against the bad guys.
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:12.400]   But, you know, who defines the bad guys?
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:14.200]   I'll talk about some bad guys.
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:18.520]   Did you guys notice that on Friday Amazon was down for two full hours?
[00:08:18.520 --> 00:08:25.000]   And when I say down, they were down, not anywhere outside the US, but the Amazon.com
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.840]   website was down.
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:34.800]   And Amazon released what was essentially a completely non informational quote that said
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:39.880]   something like, well, I'll say exactly, Amazon systems are very complex.
[00:08:39.880 --> 00:08:40.880]   Ooh.
[00:08:40.880 --> 00:08:47.360]   And on rare occasions, despite our best efforts, they may experience problems.
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:54.920]   We work to minimize disruption and get the site back as quickly.
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:55.920]   As possible.
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:58.360]   They didn't say anything as to the cause of it.
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:03.000]   In fact, if you just kind of listened without paying much attention, it would imply that
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.440]   we made a mistake.
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:12.480]   But now the plot thickens because one of Amazon's wholly owned subsidiaries, the internet movie
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:13.480]   database IMDB.
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:15.800]   Run on Pearl, by the way.
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:16.800]   All Pearl there.
[00:09:16.800 --> 00:09:17.800]   Run on Pearl.
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:18.800]   And you can't blame Pearl for this.
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:19.800]   Not blaming Pearl for this.
[00:09:19.800 --> 00:09:22.000]   Because it was down exactly the same two hours.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:24.480]   And coincidentally, well, here's this.
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:27.720]   This is from the defense in depth blog at cnet.com.
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:28.720]   Supes Rangen.
[00:09:28.720 --> 00:09:30.960]   What a great name.
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:34.400]   He's a senior member of the technical staff of network protection and management company
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:35.400]   Naras.
[00:09:35.400 --> 00:09:41.280]   Supes Rangen said in his blog post, he found evidence that at least one of the IP addresses
[00:09:41.280 --> 00:09:48.080]   used by IMDB, an address wholly owned by Amazon, fell under to a sustained DDoS attack
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:53.800]   between 10.30am and 1.30pm Pacific time on Friday.
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:58.960]   And he said the attacker seemed to open multiple connections with the IMDB's web server port
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:02.080]   80 while incrementing his source port for every new connection.
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:05.160]   You know Randall, that's a typical part of the attack.
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.520]   You don't, you can't use it.
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:10.560]   You have to spoof the IP address on every, well, every connection from web browser goes
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:11.640]   to a new source port.
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:12.640]   That's natural.
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:13.640]   Oh, OK.
[00:10:13.640 --> 00:10:14.640]   So that's nothing new.
[00:10:14.640 --> 00:10:16.800]   So he's not, oh, he's incrementing the source port, but not the IP address.
[00:10:16.800 --> 00:10:17.800]   Not the IP address.
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:20.200]   I think that's probably a misquote because that's obviously what you want to do.
[00:10:20.200 --> 00:10:23.160]   You want to use raw sockets to spoof the IP address.
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:27.640]   The attackers, now in this case, this attack was only 3 megabits a second, which with
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:30.360]   this company like Amazon is not nearly enough to bring them down.
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.880]   They probably have tens of thousands of megabits a second capacity.
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:37.560]   And I'm sure as most big companies do now, they have insurance policies.
[00:10:37.560 --> 00:10:42.040]   They have, in effect, you know, extra bandwidth that they can turn on when they're getting
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.040]   attacked.
[00:10:43.040 --> 00:10:45.680]   Nevertheless, the fact that this guy spotted it in the off-service, I talked to somebody
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:49.040]   on the radio show today who didn't want to be named.
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:54.720]   He said if I did a little scan on their DNS servers and Amazon's stealth was leaking.
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:56.040]   Stealth DNS was leaking.
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:58.280]   So there were some vulnerabilities on there.
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:01.920]   I think Amazon was detossed and Amazon doesn't want to admit it.
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:05.000]   You know, this paragraph that talking about the new source port for every connection and
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.160]   only being 3 megabits, I could easily see that.
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:09.640]   It would really depend on the payload of each one of those calls.
[00:11:09.640 --> 00:11:11.920]   Well, it could just be a sin flood.
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:15.800]   It could just be that it was simply a guy trying to scrape it on the front end.
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:16.800]   3 megabits is not an...
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:18.120]   No, I mean, I'd be like from home.
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.120]   That's not a big issue.
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.120]   That's just pretty simple.
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:22.760]   The incrementing the source port is normal for a new connection every time.
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:24.240]   I think it was just somebody scraping the side.
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.120]   So I think this guy is wrong.
[00:11:26.120 --> 00:11:27.120]   I think he's misled.
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:31.240]   Unless we see that the content doesn't show typical patterns of scraping.
[00:11:31.240 --> 00:11:32.240]   Right.
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.720]   Yeah, so we need to know more about the content and say anything about this.
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:36.320]   This does not look that suspicious.
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:38.800]   I got to look at the blog.
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:47.080]   It's Dr. Antonio Nuche's blog at N-A-R-U-S.com.
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:52.400]   If it were, let's say, is it plausible that it could have been a DDoS?
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:53.600]   Which is worse for Amazon than it?
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.720]   Was it DDoS or that they screwed up?
[00:11:55.720 --> 00:12:00.280]   Because according to CNET, it costs, I don't know if this is accurate or not, $30,000 a
[00:12:00.280 --> 00:12:02.720]   minute for Amazon to be down.
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:07.200]   Well, I can probably lend a little help here.
[00:12:07.200 --> 00:12:08.200]   Please do.
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:15.320]   One, the CNET numbers are based on the quarterly results for Amazon, which is $4.3 billion.
[00:12:15.320 --> 00:12:17.720]   So they were a wild-ass guess, in other words.
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:21.160]   Well, it's probably a fairly accurate start.
[00:12:21.160 --> 00:12:22.160]   Okay.
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:27.760]   I mean, at this point, whether it's retail sales operations tend to make most of their
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.280]   money in the fourth quarter anyway.
[00:12:29.280 --> 00:12:32.520]   But I don't know if they make it on a Friday from 10 to 1.30, but let's say it's kind
[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:33.520]   of average day.
[00:12:33.520 --> 00:12:34.520]   But it's still bad.
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:37.080]   Because people, you figure, like, end of the week, people are a little burned after spending
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:40.600]   more time messing around on the internet than maybe doing whatever.
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.720]   I discovered it because I went there to buy something and I didn't end up buying that
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:44.720]   thing.
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:48.680]   I think it's safe to say a lot of people buy stuff from Amazon most of the time.
[00:12:48.680 --> 00:12:49.680]   All the time.
[00:12:49.680 --> 00:12:55.760]   So there was $10,000 an hour or $10,000, what, a 10,000 a minute or 31,000 a minute.
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:57.240]   It's still an awful lot of money.
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:00.680]   It's somewhere between $1 and $3 million over the two hours.
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:02.040]   I mean, it's a big loss.
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:05.400]   So let's accept that.
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:13.480]   What I heard from various and sundry sources who are in partnerships with Amazon is that
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:17.800]   it was one monster attack.
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:18.800]   It has to be.
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:24.720]   So, I mean, Amazon must have, you know, the equivalent of an OC48 or more.
[00:13:24.720 --> 00:13:28.520]   I think they have several in several locations on several backbones.
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:29.520]   Exactly.
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:31.360]   So how do you bring something like that down?
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:36.240]   Do you think, I asked, we talked at the time, and one of the things we're going to start
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:39.760]   doing with Twit Live is when these things happen, we'll go live with it.
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:42.000]   We talked with Sean Allen, who was a keynote systems.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:45.440]   I know you were with Leo in the internet, Cam Leo.
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:46.440]   He was, it was great.
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:47.440]   He was on Skype.
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:49.320]   But it's something that you and I had done on Patrick.
[00:13:49.320 --> 00:13:52.160]   Many times we talked to keynote systems when these things happened.
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:56.120]   He was in the opinion that it couldn't be a DDoS attack because it would take so much
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:58.080]   bandwidth to bring a company like Amazon down.
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:05.280]   But at the same time, I said, well, is it a BGP router error like Pakistan made?
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:06.280]   It brought YouTube down?
[00:14:06.280 --> 00:14:10.440]   He said, no, it's not the border gateway protocol.
[00:14:10.440 --> 00:14:11.640]   He was puzzled, frankly.
[00:14:11.640 --> 00:14:16.560]   You know, it could be that there was some sort of, like, I know that Cisco had a note recently
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:17.560]   on some of their routers.
[00:14:17.560 --> 00:14:19.760]   There were some back doors open that shouldn't have been.
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:21.560]   There was a security note about two or three months ago.
[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:22.560]   It could have been a hack.
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:23.560]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:27.120]   It could have been a hack that caused the routers to go the wrong way for a while and
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:29.240]   took them a while to discover it.
[00:14:29.240 --> 00:14:30.960]   And they don't want to let people know.
[00:14:30.960 --> 00:14:34.920]   Well, you know, when you can't get to the machines to probe them because your routes are
[00:14:34.920 --> 00:14:37.160]   wrong, it's a lot harder.
[00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:43.640]   So would there be a symptom if you, if, I mean, how would we know if that had happened?
[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:46.960]   If a trace route goes and dies on its way there and it sounds like that's what the reports
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:47.960]   before it happened.
[00:14:47.960 --> 00:14:48.960]   I should have traced route it.
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:49.960]   I did.
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:50.960]   I was just sitting there.
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:53.320]   You want to see where it stops because if it stops where the routes have to take the right
[00:14:53.320 --> 00:14:55.560]   routing from there forward, that would be an interesting indication.
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:14:57.960]   So I didn't know about this or what I've been doing on Fridays.
[00:14:57.960 --> 00:15:00.320]   Oh, I wish I'd next time I'll call you right now.
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:01.320]   Yeah, please.
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:06.640]   See, some, the, you know, the error message I was getting was a HTTP 1.1 error.
[00:15:06.640 --> 00:15:08.120]   You know, I mean, it was a really lame error.
[00:15:08.120 --> 00:15:12.600]   It was like this is probably means that their front proxies were reachable, but the actual
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:16.160]   back end machines that were trying to do the right thing behind it were broken.
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:18.240]   And that would mean an internal routing error.
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:21.600]   So that would be, that would incline you to believe that it's either bad, cis, admin,
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:26.960]   or somebody broke into one of the routers or I kind of doubt that it was a DDoS at that
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:27.960]   point.
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:32.040]   And malicious maybe, stupid, maybe, but I don't, I'm not so sure it was, it was a
[00:15:32.040 --> 00:15:33.040]   extra.
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:34.040]   Which is, malicious or stupid?
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:37.920]   Yeah, and they had the same effect of losing a million bucks an hour or whatever.
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:38.920]   Right.
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:39.920]   No, it doesn't matter.
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:43.440]   You could see why am you could see absolutely why Amazon might not want to say what, what
[00:15:43.440 --> 00:15:44.440]   it, right?
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:46.440]   Cause they don't want to also admit maybe they've got some down refsiscos.
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:47.440]   That would be bad.
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:49.320]   But because that would be a vulnerability going forward.
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:50.320]   Yeah.
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:52.200]   You never announce your security vulnerabilities until you fix them all.
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:53.200]   Yeah.
[00:15:53.200 --> 00:15:54.200]   Yeah.
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:55.200]   Very important security tip.
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.320]   Steve Gilmore, did you try to buy anything on Friday?
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:02.280]   No, I've, I tried to buy one Beatles book two years ago.
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:03.280]   Failed.
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:04.280]   Yeah.
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:11.640]   They keep sending me cross references to things that I would buy since I bought the Beatles
[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:14.040]   book, which I never got.
[00:16:14.040 --> 00:16:19.560]   So every time you go to Amazon, it says things like, Oh, you people who bought, people who
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:23.640]   attempted to buy Beatles books, they'd also be attempting to buy Abbey Road.
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:24.640]   Exactly.
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:27.760]   He just never received what he bought.
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:29.400]   I kind of like eBay.
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:30.400]   Yeah.
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:32.600]   I mean, I, I, my wife does all that.
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:36.240]   I sit back and don't wait for it to come.
[00:16:36.240 --> 00:16:37.240]   I love Amazon.
[00:16:37.240 --> 00:16:43.840]   I, I, we're going to, at some point we have to do some, some, some accounting around, around
[00:16:43.840 --> 00:16:47.360]   to it, because especially this week, because we, or this month, because we bought a lot
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:49.720]   of stuff for the setup, but for doing live.
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:52.840]   Patrick was a little hard to hear just then, by the way.
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:54.080]   Oh, sorry.
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:56.200]   Shout Patrick.
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:58.200]   Use clear language.
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:04.800]   So I think that the one of two things happened, either Cisco was doing a marketing effort,
[00:17:04.800 --> 00:17:10.640]   or it was Twitter trying to take the heat off.
[00:17:10.640 --> 00:17:13.680]   Twitter, Twitter, maybe they, maybe they started using by accident.
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:15.160]   They routed through Twitter servers.
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:16.160]   That could be it.
[00:17:16.160 --> 00:17:19.360]   Or, or Twitter did it deliberately to take the heat off of them.
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:20.360]   Exactly.
[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:21.360]   Right.
[00:17:21.360 --> 00:17:22.360]   Oh, Amazon.
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:23.360]   Look how much it had Amazon.
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:24.360]   But the TV is gone.
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:26.360]   Everything goes away really people.
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:27.360]   Stop blaming us.
[00:17:27.360 --> 00:17:28.360]   This is just the internet.
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:30.960]   They'll take down pounds and Jaiku next.
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:35.520]   Uptime to nine, nine still isn't 100%.
[00:17:35.520 --> 00:17:41.360]   There was a very funny exchange on Twitter earlier this week between Jeanie Jardin.
[00:17:41.360 --> 00:17:45.800]   And I can't remember who she was talking with about the, the Friendster Diaspora.
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:50.000]   And the same thing, Patrick, you, I know you remember when Friendster was so hot.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.960]   I was, I remember actually, I've never actually seen a Friendster page.
[00:17:53.960 --> 00:17:54.960]   Really?
[00:17:54.960 --> 00:17:55.960]   Yeah.
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:17:56.960]   And call for help.
[00:17:56.960 --> 00:17:58.920]   So Kat Schwartz and I are talking about Friendster.
[00:17:58.920 --> 00:18:01.360]   Or maybe it was that Silicon Alley and I were talking about Friendster.
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:05.400]   And we all signed up and Friendster would go up and down, up and down because you know,
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:07.120]   it couldn't, it couldn't sustain this.
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:08.120]   It couldn't scale.
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:12.520]   And everybody was on Friendster and Friendster was a huge success and should have sold because
[00:18:12.520 --> 00:18:15.040]   they got a big offer I think and they didn't sell.
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:18.680]   And then everybody left because it was, it was, it was terrible.
[00:18:18.680 --> 00:18:19.840]   We couldn't, you couldn't use it.
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:20.840]   Same thing with early orchid.
[00:18:20.840 --> 00:18:22.960]   And now orchid is a huge success internationally.
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:23.960]   So.
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:24.960]   Orchid was.
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:25.960]   And Brazil.
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:26.960]   And Brazil mostly is.
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:27.960]   And it was big anywhere other than Brazil?
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:28.960]   I don't know.
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:31.480]   But I, when I go to the conferences in Brazil, I walk by the terminal labs and there's always
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:33.160]   purple screens as I walk by.
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:34.160]   It's really bizarre.
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.200]   Just got to remember that Randall is big in Brazil.
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:37.200]   So.
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.200]   He doesn't care.
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:39.200]   He doesn't care.
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:40.200]   He doesn't care.
[00:18:40.200 --> 00:18:41.200]   Everywhere.
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:42.200]   We're not talking about my weight now.
[00:18:42.200 --> 00:18:43.200]   Come on, Leo.
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:47.120]   So are we going to see a Twitter diaspora, Steve Gilmore?
[00:18:47.120 --> 00:18:48.120]   I don't know.
[00:18:48.120 --> 00:18:49.120]   What does diaspora mean?
[00:18:49.120 --> 00:18:54.360]   That's when the people of Israel went across the land and then, and then we're dispersed
[00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:55.360]   across the land.
[00:18:55.360 --> 00:18:57.840]   Oh, is it diaspora or diaspora?
[00:18:57.840 --> 00:18:58.840]   I don't know.
[00:18:58.840 --> 00:19:00.840]   Now you're asking me.
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:01.840]   Or just spore.
[00:19:01.840 --> 00:19:05.880]   People keep saying that it's going to be a ghost town.
[00:19:05.880 --> 00:19:06.880]   But I don't buy it.
[00:19:06.880 --> 00:19:11.760]   I think there's too many addicts walking around waiting for the boat to come in.
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:17.520]   It comes from the ancient Greek diaspora, a scattering or sowing of seeds.
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:20.920]   Orchid, I think it's the real question.
[00:19:20.920 --> 00:19:23.000]   Well that's the, you know, and it's a blur.
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:24.480]   This book briefly was very interesting.
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.480]   You think Facebook ran all short?
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:29.280]   Well, to go away from a friendster.
[00:19:29.280 --> 00:19:31.480]   For their, no, no, no, a friendster frayed from Twitter.
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:33.000]   Oh man, I don't know.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.880]   I'd love for them to come up on a Jaiku or something because I think Jaiku is a much
[00:19:35.880 --> 00:19:36.880]   better design model.
[00:19:36.880 --> 00:19:37.880]   I agree.
[00:19:37.880 --> 00:19:38.880]   I think Jaiku, Google missed the boat.
[00:19:38.880 --> 00:19:39.880]   Google bought Jaiku.
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:40.880]   And then they stopped their subscriptions.
[00:19:40.880 --> 00:19:41.880]   I can't get anybody else on it.
[00:19:41.880 --> 00:19:42.880]   They closed it down and invite only.
[00:19:42.880 --> 00:19:43.880]   I don't know.
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:46.600]   I don't know whether they missed the boat.
[00:19:46.600 --> 00:19:51.400]   I ran into one of the co-founders at Google the other day.
[00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:54.000]   Yiri or Petra?
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.160]   What was the first one?
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:56.160]   Yiri.
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.160]   Yiri.
[00:19:57.160 --> 00:19:58.160]   Yiri.
[00:19:58.160 --> 00:19:59.160]   He's a great guy.
[00:19:59.160 --> 00:20:00.160]   Yes.
[00:20:00.160 --> 00:20:02.240]   And he seems to have something up his sleeve.
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:06.120]   Well I think that's just that smoked herring that they like so much with Jaiku.
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:10.520]   Would Jaiku specifically or just, what somebody told me is that, because I asked the same
[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:13.720]   question, I said, well, you know, what's happening with Jaiku?
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:18.960]   And they said, well, Yiri and Petra are busy putting presents everywhere in Google's stuff,
[00:20:18.960 --> 00:20:20.400]   particularly Android, right?
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:21.360]   Ooh.
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:22.960]   Well, I think that's a good guess.
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:29.600]   But I think that they're going to resurface looking completely different but completely
[00:20:29.600 --> 00:20:31.440]   embedded in everything that Google's doing.
[00:20:31.440 --> 00:20:35.400]   Now's the time because I think there are, if, don't, do you think Steve, if there were
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:41.320]   a credible, I don't think Fred feeds it, if there were a credible successor to Twitter
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:45.520]   that you could see this kind of sudden flocking to it?
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:46.680]   No, I don't actually.
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:51.320]   I think the Twitter is, Twitter has the core audience.
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:55.680]   And they're not going to lose it no matter how pathetic the service is today.
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:56.920]   I am ready to leave Twitter.
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:20:59.720]   I got to say it's just, it's really, it's getting to be.
[00:20:59.720 --> 00:21:01.560]   But you're also fickle, Leo.
[00:21:01.560 --> 00:21:02.560]   I'm very fickle.
[00:21:02.560 --> 00:21:05.640]   But don't you think everybody who uses Twitter is very fickle?
[00:21:05.640 --> 00:21:09.320]   I am not fickle because, because the other thing is like, because I've watched.
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:10.880]   Because you never join anything.
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:15.880]   Well, I've joined Twitter, but I mean, it took us a long time to get you on Twitter.
[00:21:15.880 --> 00:21:16.880]   No kidding.
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:20.120]   In fact, Veronica was the one who got you on Twitter.
[00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:26.240]   But I can also say that in the time it took me to get on Twitter, some people I know,
[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:31.640]   some of who may even be on this particular episode of Twitter, have gone from like dodge
[00:21:31.640 --> 00:21:37.240]   ball to Twitter to haiku flirted with ploughs and then ended up back on Twitter and are
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:43.080]   now talking about plerk, all of which essentially exist in the same space.
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:45.840]   Yeah, we're just looking for one thing that will work.
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:47.400]   But for me, it's got to have threads.
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:50.440]   It's got to have jaiku style threads or I'm not going to be happy there.
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:51.440]   I like that.
[00:21:51.440 --> 00:21:52.440]   That's the thing I do like about Jaiku.
[00:21:52.440 --> 00:21:55.320]   That's why I like friend feed is it's very much like Jaiku in that respect.
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:57.120]   It has the threaded conversation.
[00:21:57.120 --> 00:22:02.200]   I have a Jaiku also has as friend feed does the ability to add your RSS feeds to it.
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:07.200]   And it has what it has at Jaiku that nobody else has very well is that great Nokia client.
[00:22:07.200 --> 00:22:10.520]   If it would work on Android, where it's an iPhone and the iPhone.
[00:22:10.520 --> 00:22:12.160]   And the iPhone, please.
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:13.160]   And Blackberry.
[00:22:13.160 --> 00:22:16.400]   That's that automatically updates your location.
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:17.400]   Yeah.
[00:22:17.400 --> 00:22:21.280]   And it was a very nice way of updating your status as well.
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.680]   I think that was a great, I loved Jaiku.
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:25.480]   You and I were the only people who used it though, Randy.
[00:22:25.480 --> 00:22:26.480]   Yeah, I'm still using it.
[00:22:26.480 --> 00:22:27.880]   I still have a big following over there.
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:28.880]   I post their do you?
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:29.880]   So you engage in a lot of conversations?
[00:22:29.880 --> 00:22:30.880]   Yeah, I do.
[00:22:30.880 --> 00:22:32.920]   I have a lot of threads going on there where I answer somebody else's questions.
[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:34.160]   Somebody else answers my question.
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:37.600]   I really like that because for me, it's a miniature version of Usenet, which I really
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:38.600]   like.
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:41.120]   Or miniature version of most web forums, which is great.
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:44.200]   I actually, that's exactly how you have the time when I'm on Twitter.
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:47.080]   I'm engaging in a conversation with the people that are following.
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.240]   And it's not made for that.
[00:22:48.240 --> 00:22:49.480]   It's terrible for that.
[00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:50.480]   Absolutely.
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:51.480]   No.
[00:22:51.480 --> 00:22:55.440]   But that also seems to be the way, because I've also unlisted people because they didn't
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:23:01.880]   feel like watching getting like 22 at-speeds every time when they were making decision
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:03.640]   about where to have lunch.
[00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:04.640]   Right.
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:08.760]   So like subsets of your followers or friends would be a really good idea for a lot of
[00:23:08.760 --> 00:23:09.760]   people.
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:14.160]   Well, we really need a service that has not only people you follow, but maybe you're
[00:23:14.160 --> 00:23:16.960]   going to be, let them add keywords to each message.
[00:23:16.960 --> 00:23:20.560]   Then I could say, well, I only want to hear Leo's messages about where he's going to
[00:23:20.560 --> 00:23:21.560]   be this week.
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:22.560]   Right.
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:25.040]   Or I only want to hear Leo's messages about, you need to like have a two-dimensional
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:26.040]   matrix.
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:27.040]   Much more refined tools.
[00:23:27.040 --> 00:23:28.040]   People and keywords.
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:29.040]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:30.040]   I think you need much more refined.
[00:23:30.040 --> 00:23:31.040]   I think I'll write one of these this week and get famous.
[00:23:31.040 --> 00:23:32.040]   Well, that's the thing is, couldn't you?
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:33.040]   See, side.
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.040]   See, side.
[00:23:34.040 --> 00:23:35.040]   Here's your programmer.
[00:23:35.040 --> 00:23:36.040]   Couldn't you whip something up?
[00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:37.040]   I shouldn't have even said it out loud because now somebody that's going to go do it.
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:40.200]   Please, somebody do it and tell me about it and I'll join here with somebody that has
[00:23:40.200 --> 00:23:41.760]   the expertise to talk about this.
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:42.760]   Why?
[00:23:42.760 --> 00:23:45.080]   Because he's Twitter having such scaling problems.
[00:23:45.080 --> 00:23:46.280]   Why do so many sites like this?
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:50.320]   They have one master MySQL and two slave MySQL servers.
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:51.320]   That's it.
[00:23:51.320 --> 00:23:52.320]   That's what everybody's saying.
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:53.320]   Yeah.
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:54.320]   That's part of it.
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:55.320]   And why is that a problem?
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:56.320]   It's a bottleneck?
[00:23:56.320 --> 00:24:00.560]   Yeah, because everything, because they're using, from what I understand, I haven't done
[00:24:00.560 --> 00:24:05.440]   a lot of research on this, but they're using a sort of a blog architecture when they really
[00:24:05.440 --> 00:24:07.560]   should be using a message-based architecture.
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:09.160]   Yeah, that seems like a mistake.
[00:24:09.160 --> 00:24:10.160]   It is.
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:11.160]   It's not a blog.
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:14.080]   It isn't there a reason they use the blog architecture?
[00:24:14.080 --> 00:24:15.080]   Probably.
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:18.080]   For those of us, including myself, we don't know exactly know what a blog architecture
[00:24:18.080 --> 00:24:22.720]   is, what exactly is the difference between a blog architecture and a messaging architecture?
[00:24:22.720 --> 00:24:27.280]   Well, one of the things that ties it down is that every message you're typing has to
[00:24:27.280 --> 00:24:35.480]   go all the way down to be essentially a new post on a thread down with your user ID.
[00:24:35.480 --> 00:24:39.920]   But really, it only needs to go out for a couple of hours at most to all the people
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:41.320]   who are subscribed to you.
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:44.360]   So it should have stayed more in sort of a local cache, rather than going all the way
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:48.280]   down, making a full detailed post like you would have in a blog model where you want
[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:50.680]   to come back six months from now and see all those messages.
[00:24:50.680 --> 00:24:55.000]   So I'm just, I'd actually wish it was, I actually liked them, the architecture where I'd be
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:57.320]   able to search everything and look at all their stuff.
[00:24:57.320 --> 00:24:59.240]   I'm not saying this wouldn't be possible.
[00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:03.040]   I'm just saying that what they should do is have two levels where most of it is about
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:06.880]   getting messages, short messages from one user to another, and that's one level of the
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:11.440]   system and then behind that is an archival system that then means it's for a longer
[00:25:11.440 --> 00:25:12.440]   level.
[00:25:12.440 --> 00:25:14.000]   This has been discussed in a couple of blogs I saw about this.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:17.720]   It's to have like a two level thing where you have a message switching architecture in
[00:25:17.720 --> 00:25:21.840]   the front and a long term archival and look up service in the back.
[00:25:21.840 --> 00:25:24.880]   And then you don't need to take every message all the way down to an archival system.
[00:25:24.880 --> 00:25:25.880]   That's a checker does it, do you know?
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:26.880]   I don't know how arch, I could do it.
[00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:32.400]   You know, that's interesting what you're saying there because I think that if you split
[00:25:32.400 --> 00:25:38.040]   the service into those two components, the second part of that is really not a, there's
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:39.880]   no issue with latency.
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:46.280]   The only problem right now is that the APIs are pumping out the whole ball of wax and
[00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:53.480]   so everything, any service that wants to do, the second part of that has to put their bandwidth
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:56.560]   constraints on the real time part.
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:57.560]   Absolutely.
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:58.560]   Yeah, exactly what I'm saying.
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:02.600]   You really have two different needs to go to that data and they've built it all under
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:03.600]   one architecture.
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:06.520]   Again, from what I understand, it's only with the stuff I see in the public.
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:07.520]   All right.
[00:26:07.520 --> 00:26:10.800]   I'm a contrarian from your guy's perspective, however.
[00:26:10.800 --> 00:26:19.240]   I think that the ability to be able to search down using the track mechanism into Twitter
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:27.640]   in real time and to nail up live real time conversations is fundamental.
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:32.160]   The difference between an IAM conversation and a semi-public conversation where you're
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:37.200]   not only broadcasting, but you're also talking to specific affinity groups.
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:42.240]   I know this is a lot of buzzwords and people on TechCrunch hate me for saying it, but I
[00:26:42.240 --> 00:26:44.600]   think that's a revolutionary.
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:48.040]   Well, Friend Feed does this very well.
[00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:53.080]   I don't think so because the problem with Friend Feed from my perspective is that it's
[00:26:53.080 --> 00:26:59.280]   like it's a silo where comments and conversations go to die.
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:01.600]   You can't find them after they go in there.
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:02.600]   Right.
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:04.160]   It's like the real thing to tell for the conversation.
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:05.160]   Yeah, no, I agree.
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:10.160]   In fact, my big complaint is that my blog post goes on Friend Feed.
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:13.080]   People comment on it and that's it and now it's buried in Friend Feed.
[00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:16.120]   I want to keep that conversation alive on my blog.
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:19.520]   I found there is a WordPress tool that will allow you to do that.
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:23.560]   We really need more open two way silos or bad.
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:25.560]   Silos are bad.
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:26.560]   Silos are bad.
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:27.960]   That's why we don't want to put our data.
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:34.560]   Now, Yuri, the last thing he said was in April and he said we're porting Jaiku to the
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:37.320]   Google App Engine.
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:38.320]   That's that wonderful thing.
[00:27:38.320 --> 00:27:39.960]   Do you like the Google App Engine, Randall?
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:42.240]   Do you think that's in Python?
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:43.240]   It's in Python.
[00:27:43.240 --> 00:27:44.240]   You don't like that?
[00:27:44.240 --> 00:27:46.880]   I'll tell you why.
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:52.640]   I mean, it's a great deal for anybody who wants to kind of prototype a new website because
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:53.640]   you get a lot of it.
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:54.640]   I don't remember what it is.
[00:27:54.640 --> 00:27:57.440]   A million or two million visits a month for free, basically.
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:04.800]   I have to say I like the Amazon EC2 a little bit better for the reasons that you've got
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:07.480]   more flexibility about the architecture using to get into it.
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:11.040]   I am talking to some of my small talk friends, though, about maybe figuring out a way to
[00:28:11.040 --> 00:28:14.360]   get that into Google's engine, which would be interesting.
[00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:15.360]   Oh, that would be very interesting.
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.360]   I think a lot of fun.
[00:28:17.360 --> 00:28:21.640]   Well, anyway, I know people hate it when we get too off a far-field with Twitter, but
[00:28:21.640 --> 00:28:25.800]   I think there certainly is a conversation there.
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:26.800]   We're talking about Twitter?
[00:28:26.800 --> 00:28:27.800]   They're talking about Jaiku.
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:28.800]   We aren't talking about it.
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:29.800]   We're talking about it.
[00:28:29.800 --> 00:28:34.160]   If a service like that can succeed and if it could, would people move there?
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:36.960]   Steve, you say, "No, I'm always going to stay exactly where they are."
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:37.960]   No, I didn't say that.
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:43.960]   I said that by the time there's a service that's going to compete with it, it's going to work.
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:48.640]   Twitter is going to be back.
[00:28:48.640 --> 00:28:49.920]   It's working pretty well today.
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:52.760]   Tomorrow will be an interesting issue.
[00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:54.200]   Let's move from Twitter to murder.
[00:28:54.200 --> 00:28:55.280]   How about that?
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:56.280]   What's happening?
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:57.280]   What's happening?
[00:28:57.280 --> 00:28:59.400]   Not the World Wide Developers Conference?
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:00.400]   That's what I'm wondering.
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:02.000]   Leah, what have you heard?
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   About WWDC.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.720]   Well, I'm hearing the same rumors all of you are hearing.
[00:29:07.720 --> 00:29:14.240]   I think it's pretty clear, although there's one contrarian who says Steve's not going to
[00:29:14.240 --> 00:29:19.280]   announce a new iPhone, but he's a voice and a wilderness because everybody agrees that
[00:29:19.280 --> 00:29:24.200]   3G iPhone, the AT&T really is pre-announced is going to be out on Monday tomorrow.
[00:29:24.200 --> 00:29:26.560]   We're going to do live coverage, by the way.
[00:29:26.560 --> 00:29:28.040]   Not from the WWDC.
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:31.000]   We can't actually do a coverage from the end of the day.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.040]   What we're going to do, and gadgets there, gives motives there.
[00:29:34.040 --> 00:29:38.680]   Actually, I've heard that a lot of people, and maybe I'm just talking to the wrong people,
[00:29:38.680 --> 00:29:42.600]   but I heard that press access was enormously difficult for this one.
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:43.600]   Much limited.
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:46.840]   I asked for pass and they did not give me one.
[00:29:46.840 --> 00:29:50.280]   The problem is that this is the first World Wide Developers Conference for Apple that's
[00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:56.080]   been sold out, which tells you that Apple's got a market for developers writing on the
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:29:59.880]   iPhone platform, and Apple's clearly, people are very excited about that.
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:03.840]   Not just the iPhone, but the Macs are really making headway, too, which is really, I mean,
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:05.840]   it's coming across all across.
[00:30:05.840 --> 00:30:06.840]   I mean, what are they?
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:09.360]   They're like a third or a half of machines over a thousand bucks.
[00:30:09.360 --> 00:30:10.360]   And they're growing fast.
[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:11.360]   Yeah.
[00:30:11.360 --> 00:30:12.360]   So we talked about that last week.
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:13.360]   Sure.
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:14.560]   I mean, it's a very strong platform.
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:15.560]   Yeah.
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:19.600]   So we will be covering it out from outside the room, but I think this is going to be
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:20.600]   more fun.
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:26.000]   Andy Inako inspired me because last keynote from Steve Jobs, Andy did his couch keynote,
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.920]   where he was sitting in his apartment in Boston, refreshing and gadget like all of us, making
[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:31.920]   a sandwich.
[00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:32.920]   And he said, "I'm going to have to talk the whole thing.
[00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:34.920]   Let's see what's on Battlestar Galactica."
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:35.920]   Nothing much.
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:36.920]   Let's see what Steve has to say.
[00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:40.920]   So what we're going to do is Andy Inako, John Maltz, who wrote Crazy Apple Rumors, which
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:45.000]   is one of the funniest sites ever, and I will be covering doing meta coverage starting
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.160]   at 9.30 tomorrow morning Pacific Time.
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:50.480]   So we'll be refreshing the real refreshing gadgets so you don't have to.
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:55.480]   You should get a big couch on a flatbed truck and sit it right outside the building next
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:56.480]   year.
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:57.480]   Right.
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:58.480]   That's what the buildings say.
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:00.960]   But in those walls, Steve Jobs right now is seeing this.
[00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:05.360]   Chris Brine who writes for Macquil Magazine, I asked him a couple of days ago, I said,
[00:31:05.360 --> 00:31:06.360]   "Are you going to be in there?"
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:07.360]   He said, "I don't know yet.
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:08.520]   We only have limited seats.
[00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:10.640]   He is going to be in the keynote."
[00:31:10.640 --> 00:31:12.680]   So when he comes out the door, we're going to grab him.
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:13.840]   We'll get him on the show.
[00:31:13.840 --> 00:31:16.640]   So you're actually coming down to San Francisco for this?
[00:31:16.640 --> 00:31:17.640]   No, I'm doing it from here.
[00:31:17.640 --> 00:31:18.640]   I'm not moving.
[00:31:18.640 --> 00:31:21.640]   Oh, see, I was always hoping you're actually going to be at the event.
[00:31:21.640 --> 00:31:22.640]   I couldn't get in.
[00:31:22.640 --> 00:31:24.480]   Apple wouldn't give me a credential.
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:26.720]   Well, you said you were going to be sitting outside.
[00:31:26.720 --> 00:31:27.720]   No, that's me.
[00:31:27.720 --> 00:31:29.200]   That's Randall's idea.
[00:31:29.200 --> 00:31:30.200]   I think it's a great idea.
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:33.120]   And I think maybe one of these days, maybe next year, we'll do that.
[00:31:33.120 --> 00:31:36.800]   I think it's kind of fun to have a couch out there and do Twit Live from the street.
[00:31:36.800 --> 00:31:37.800]   Certainly you can.
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:39.000]   I mean, it's not hard to do that.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.760]   Well, you'd have to get a parking spot like a week before.
[00:31:40.760 --> 00:31:42.880]   You just leave the truck there and see.
[00:31:42.880 --> 00:31:45.920]   So what we're going to do is we'll sit here.
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:46.920]   I'll be sitting here.
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:47.920]   Andy will be in Boston.
[00:31:47.920 --> 00:31:49.480]   I don't know where Moltz is.
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:53.400]   And we'll be doing just like this, talking about what's going on.
[00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:55.800]   And then we'll get somebody who was actually there, Chris Brine, after the fact.
[00:31:55.800 --> 00:31:58.600]   But you can't stream video of the keynote.
[00:31:58.600 --> 00:31:59.600]   They won't let you do it.
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:04.040]   So anyway, to answer your question, Steve, obviously a 3G phone, it looks like the firmware
[00:32:04.040 --> 00:32:05.040]   is pretty clear.
[00:32:05.040 --> 00:32:07.640]   It's going to have a GPS capability built into it.
[00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:08.640]   Most likely.
[00:32:08.640 --> 00:32:10.560]   I saw some disagreement with that, though, too.
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:11.560]   Seems like you'd want to.
[00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:14.520]   Did you see the pictures, though, of the-- yeah.
[00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:16.800]   So the putative pictures of the iPhone.
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:18.800]   It was color and it has-- it looked kind of like--
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:20.920]   But one of them's missing us an on/off switch.
[00:32:20.920 --> 00:32:23.080]   So it was a bad Photoshop.
[00:32:23.080 --> 00:32:24.840]   Yeah, I think it was bad Photoshop.
[00:32:24.840 --> 00:32:26.920]   I don't think Apple's-- I think Apple doesn't let you say that.
[00:32:26.920 --> 00:32:32.800]   Well, the only thing that I saw in that picture that they implied in that story was the idea
[00:32:32.800 --> 00:32:34.920]   of a front-facing camera.
[00:32:34.920 --> 00:32:38.040]   Well they need a front-facing camera for video chat.
[00:32:38.040 --> 00:32:39.040]   Video conferencing.
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:40.040]   Exactly.
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:42.520]   That's a pretty big deal, don't you think?
[00:32:42.520 --> 00:32:44.880]   Well, we would be able to see you for a change.
[00:32:44.880 --> 00:32:45.880]   If you can't win.
[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:46.880]   Probably not.
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:49.280]   Because I find something to make it happen.
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:50.280]   But you make a good point.
[00:32:50.280 --> 00:32:53.920]   I mean, from my point of view, this is exactly what I would love.
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:33:00.160]   I mean, in fact, maybe Chris Breen will come out of the door with one in his hand and he'd
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:02.720]   be doing it from-- I would love that.
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:04.280]   That would make me really happy.
[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:07.440]   So I think that there are a couple of things they can do.
[00:33:07.440 --> 00:33:10.880]   But really, I think what's really interesting, maybe they'll make some announcements that
[00:33:10.880 --> 00:33:12.800]   will make everybody sit up and take notice on the iPhone.
[00:33:12.800 --> 00:33:17.160]   I think one of them's going to have to be a subsidized phone only because it's only been
[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:18.160]   out for a year.
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:21.320]   What about me and all the people who bought our iPhone a year ago from AT&T?
[00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:23.880]   We got another year to run before we get another phone.
[00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:27.560]   There's no way they're going to pay the subsidy to non-new customers though.
[00:33:27.560 --> 00:33:28.560]   So we're screwed to do that.
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:29.560]   That's what I'm saying.
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:31.840]   I think they need to do a deal for early adopters.
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:32.840]   No.
[00:33:32.840 --> 00:33:33.840]   We paid our money.
[00:33:33.840 --> 00:33:35.600]   We paid our money to get our service already.
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:36.600]   That's it.
[00:33:36.600 --> 00:33:38.960]   They're going to make a lot of people mad if they come out with a 3G iPhone and it's
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:42.440]   going to cost me-- Leo, how many times have you bought a laptop the next day the price
[00:33:42.440 --> 00:33:43.700]   went down?
[00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:44.700]   This is not a laptop.
[00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:47.280]   This is a phone and it's a very good world deal.
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:50.160]   Steve, do you think they'll offer some sort of deal for early adopters?
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:54.720]   Well, I think that they'll allow you to be able to upgrade without having to change
[00:33:54.720 --> 00:33:56.000]   the service contract.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   Oh, thanks.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:58.280]   Well, actually that would be a big one.
[00:33:58.280 --> 00:34:00.040]   It doesn't bump it to another two years.
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:01.040]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:03.040]   But they can guarantee that anyway because all I do is take the SIM card out and I'm
[00:34:03.040 --> 00:34:04.040]   done.
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:06.760]   So there's nothing to do to stop that.
[00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:10.240]   Yeah, but the iPhone is not like your traditional GSM phone where you just swap the SIMs.
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:11.240]   Yeah, it is.
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:12.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:13.240]   I have two iPhones.
[00:34:13.240 --> 00:34:14.240]   I have one that I bricked.
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:16.240]   And you're swapping back all this work, okay.
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:17.240]   Yes.

[00:58:24.240 --> 00:58:30.240]   Leo, did you hear Bommer said that there won't be magazines 10 years?
[00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:34.240]   Bommer's right. Don't you think Bommer's right?
[00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:40.240]   No. Arthur Oaks Salzberger said there won't be a New York Times print edition in 10 years.
[00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:46.240]   Well I think that's right. Well why would a magazine survive when newspapers don't?
[00:58:46.240 --> 00:58:50.240]   The John airplanes are like that.
[00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:52.240]   Maybe. I guess you're right.
[00:58:52.240 --> 00:58:56.240]   They're also, but as someone who started out with magazines,
[00:58:56.240 --> 00:59:00.240]   but I mean magazines have changed so much in the last decade for a lot of reasons.
[00:59:00.240 --> 00:59:04.240]   But aren't they hideously expensive to produce now and going up?
[00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:10.240]   And are people buying advertising in them and are people, I mean maybe that's
[00:59:10.240 --> 00:59:14.240]   wishful thinking Steve Bommer thinks on everything's going to go online, but
[00:59:14.240 --> 00:59:16.240]   still needs something for the first 10,000 feet Leo.
[00:59:16.240 --> 00:59:18.240]   Yeah exactly.
[00:59:18.240 --> 00:59:22.240]   Well I mean I know here's a question for the esteemed panel.
[00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:26.240]   Can I leave the Kindle on and read the Kindle while we're taking off?
[00:59:26.240 --> 00:59:28.240]   No. Not according to them.
[00:59:28.240 --> 00:59:30.240]   Well you can, as long as they don't know it.
[00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:32.240]   Yeah. It doesn't look, but it looks like a computer.
[00:59:32.240 --> 00:59:34.240]   Does it? Yeah it looks too much computer.
[00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:36.240]   You think that they're going to say you're looking at a computer?
[00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:40.240]   There have been complaints about iPhones who people, they didn't realize that the iPhone would put in the airplane mode.
[00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:42.240]   Right. Yeah they think it's a problem.
[00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:44.240]   Because every phone can be put, I mean a blackberry.
[00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:48.240]   Yeah but I mean I've had, I've actually physically taken a phone out of somebody's hand on take-off.
[00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:50.240]   Oh I love you Patrick.
[00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:54.240]   Well yeah but I mean it was just you know, everybody knows that.
[00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:56.240]   I'm like you know what?
[00:59:56.240 --> 00:59:57.240]   No it's not.
[00:59:57.240 --> 01:00:02.240]   My hands are wrapped on your throat and we barrel in at 600 hours.
[01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:06.240]   Exactly. It may be, but just in case, could you turn it off?
[01:00:06.240 --> 01:00:07.240]   Just in case.
[01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:12.240]   And I don't want to hear you and your business deal while I'm sitting here in terror.
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:13.240]   Okay.
[01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:17.240]   Well I'm sitting here concentrating very hard on keeping me poorly aerodynamically designed.
[01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:19.240]   (laughter)
[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:29.240]   But I mean it's, but it's from, I met some, we actually had some guys show up once that were avionics technicians for United.
[01:00:29.240 --> 01:00:30.240]   Right.
[01:00:30.240 --> 01:00:34.240]   And partially because of a whole, you know, we hate anything not made in the United States.
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:38.240]   They all claim they will never ever ride on any airbus planes.
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:44.240]   They also, they had, they had no problem with planes, with phones on take-offs.
[01:00:44.240 --> 01:00:48.240]   They've, they've felt on certain planes, they really didn't want anybody using a phone on landing.
[01:00:48.240 --> 01:00:50.240]   Oh really? The landing?
[01:00:50.240 --> 01:00:54.240]   Well they consider the landings are a little, a little sketchier.
[01:00:54.240 --> 01:00:56.240]   Landings are sketchier than take-offs.
[01:00:56.240 --> 01:01:02.240]   Well I'll tell you why. They don't want people working with anything like electronics during take-off and landing.
[01:01:02.240 --> 01:01:05.240]   It's because they want their full attention in case something goes wrong.
[01:01:05.240 --> 01:01:06.240]   They want to get everybody's attention.
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:10.240]   That same reason they won't let you like have like an iPod or something.
[01:01:10.240 --> 01:01:13.240]   Yeah, and Canada they make you take the headphones out of your ear.
[01:01:13.240 --> 01:01:14.240]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:18.240]   You need to be attentive to what's going on because that's when they're going to want your attention most.
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:23.240]   They don't want anybody not paying attention during that first 10,000 or last 10,000 because there's things that could happen.
[01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:24.240]   And I say that-
[01:01:24.240 --> 01:01:27.240]   I think they want to maintain a firm grip on your wallet.
[01:01:27.240 --> 01:01:28.240]   That's what they do.
[01:01:28.240 --> 01:01:31.240]   But that's what I'm saying is do you think a Kindle's a problem, right?
[01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:36.240]   Frankly, that would be the only compelling reason for magazines or books to survive in my opinion.
[01:01:36.240 --> 01:01:38.240]   It's just for the first 10,000 people.
[01:01:38.240 --> 01:01:39.240]   I'm surprised.
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:40.240]   I'm surprised they don't make it take magazines.
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:43.240]   I swear they don't make it put magazines away because that's distracting.
[01:01:43.240 --> 01:01:44.240]   You may not read.
[01:01:44.240 --> 01:01:49.240]   Okay, how may I show a hand when they say could you please cease your conversation so we could tell you how to put on your life preserver?
[01:01:49.240 --> 01:01:51.240]   Do you cease your conversation?
[01:01:51.240 --> 01:01:52.240]   No.
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:53.240]   No, no.
[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:56.240]   I have ignored the safety dance far too many times already.
[01:01:56.240 --> 01:01:57.240]   We've seen it many times.
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:01:58.240]   The little-
[01:01:58.240 --> 01:02:03.240]   Are you ready for gossip? Are you ready for murder, mayhem, sex, drugs and rock and roll?
[01:02:03.240 --> 01:02:04.240]   I love this one.
[01:02:04.240 --> 01:02:05.240]   Alright.
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:08.240]   Let's start with the Hans Reiser stories.
[01:02:08.240 --> 01:02:10.240]   Obviously Mr. Schwartz is taking great rides.
[01:02:10.240 --> 01:02:11.240]   Did you ever know Hans Reiser?
[01:02:11.240 --> 01:02:12.240]   I didn't.
[01:02:12.240 --> 01:02:14.240]   I've actually not met him, not exchanged email with him.
[01:02:14.240 --> 01:02:18.240]   It's a Linux programmer who wrote the Reiser FS, which is a running Linux-
[01:02:18.240 --> 01:02:20.240]   I don't even know anything that matters, so it doesn't matter to me.
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:22.240]   But the Reiser FS was the first journaled file system.
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:25.240]   You know, he had- he showed me an EXT too and a Reiser.
[01:02:25.240 --> 01:02:26.240]   It was very good.
[01:02:26.240 --> 01:02:27.240]   Good for them.
[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:31.240]   The story of Hans- this is just insane.
[01:02:31.240 --> 01:02:34.240]   I'm mostly interested in this story because I'm amused by it.
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:36.240]   I'm shocked by it.
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:42.240]   And for those of you that don't know in the audience there, apparently Hans Reiser has offered to-
[01:02:42.240 --> 01:02:47.240]   Of course, of all, we should say he was convicted of murdering his wife, even though his wife needed-
[01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:49.240]   even though nobody was ever found- Or murder weapon.
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:50.240]   Or murder weapon.
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:54.240]   In fact, some people said, you know, this isn't really right.
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:03:00.240]   They convicted him basically because he was a nerd and he did weird things like pull a seat out of his car.
[01:03:00.240 --> 01:03:03.240]   And his attorney said, you know, he's just a weirdo.
[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:05.240]   We acknowledge he's a weirdo, but he's not a murderer.
[01:03:05.240 --> 01:03:08.240]   However, somebody was convicted- Yes.
[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:10.240]   -however- A first degree murder.
[01:03:10.240 --> 01:03:13.240]   -The first degree murder- Which carries 25 to life.
[01:03:13.240 --> 01:03:14.240]   Okay.
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:18.240]   So what he's trying to do now through his attorney, apparently, is he saying,
[01:03:18.240 --> 01:03:23.240]   could you reduce that to second degree murder if I show you where the body is?
[01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:26.240]   -You're sure. -I didn't do it.
[01:03:26.240 --> 01:03:27.240]   -This is insane!
[01:03:27.240 --> 01:03:29.240]   -And my wife fled to Russia.
[01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:31.240]   -Oh, yeah, so the Russia, I didn't know what it is.
[01:03:31.240 --> 01:03:35.240]   -But yeah, if you do reduce my sense, I'll show you where she is.
[01:03:35.240 --> 01:03:36.240]   -Right.
[01:03:36.240 --> 01:03:37.240]   [laughter]
[01:03:37.240 --> 01:03:42.240]   I just- I couldn't stop laughing and I posted this in my J.K. thread to have people commenting on that.
[01:03:42.240 --> 01:03:43.240]   It was just insane.
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:44.240]   -He is, they're saying.
[01:03:44.240 --> 01:03:50.240]   Somebody said in the chatroom, it's just a theory in the chatroom says he's the nerd O.J.
[01:03:50.240 --> 01:03:52.240]   [laughter]
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:54.240]   -With all the accompanying features.
[01:03:54.240 --> 01:03:56.240]   -We finally have our nerd O.J.
[01:03:56.240 --> 01:04:02.240]   -Oh, this is just- this is just- you know, they're not going to- when they make the TV movie about this,
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:07.240]   which you know they will, when they get to this part, the editor is going to have to scribble that out and say,
[01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:10.240]   "It ain't no way this ever possible will happen."
[01:04:10.240 --> 01:04:11.240]   -It would pull up the wire story there.
[01:04:11.240 --> 01:04:13.240]   -This is- This is- This is- Nobody would believe yet.
[01:04:13.240 --> 01:04:14.240]   [laughter]
[01:04:14.240 --> 01:04:15.240]   -All right.
[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:17.240]   Well, okay, there's your murder story.
[01:04:17.240 --> 01:04:18.240]   -Yeah.
[01:04:18.240 --> 01:04:43.960]   -The story too- -A
[01:04:43.960 --> 01:05:13.960]   -The story too- -The story too- -The story too- -The story too- -The story too- -The story too- -The story too- -The story too- -The story too- -The story too- -The story too- -The story too- -The story too- -The story too- -The story too- -The story too- -The story too- -The story too- -The story too- -The story too- -The story too- -The story too- -The story too- -The story too- -The story too- -The story too- -The story too- -The story too- -The story too- -The story too- -The story too- -The story too- -The story too- -The story too- -The story too- -The story too- -The story too- -The story too- -The story too- -The story too- -The story too- -The story too- -The story too- -The story too
[01:05:13.960 --> 01:05:15.960]   -We went to Russian River.
[01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:16.960]   -Not Russia.
[01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:17.960]   -Not the actual Russia.
[01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:18.960]   -Here's the sex and drugs.
[01:05:18.960 --> 01:05:19.960]   -Yes.
[01:05:19.960 --> 01:05:26.960]   -Henry T. Nicholas III, who has one of the best names in the- he's the billionaire founder of Broadcom.
[01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:34.960]   He's been indicted on narcotics charges that include allegations he slips ecstasy into the drinks of business associates,
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:41.960]   maintained a drug warehouse with ecstasy, methamphetamine, cocaine,
[01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:45.960]   and concealed his illegal conduct with bribes and death threats.
[01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:47.960]   He's also been charged with 21 counts.
[01:05:47.960 --> 01:05:52.960]   This actually all started because of a stock options back dating scandal.
[01:05:52.960 --> 01:06:00.960]   He's got 21 counts of stock options back dating, but then as the trial, or I guess the indictment went on,
[01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:01.960]   they included a lot of other stuff.
[01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:02.960]   Now, the guy's a billionaire.
[01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:04.960]   He's got a lot of money.
[01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:09.960]   It's an 18-page indictment.
[01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:17.960]   I'm looking at the story from the telegraph in the UK, which in the UK they have a greater sense of scandal than we do.
[01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:29.960]   In one of the counts, the Department of Justice alleges that Nicholas told a Broadcom employee to hand $5,000 to $10,000 in cash to a drug career in the company's lobby.
[01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:37.960]   In another, on a plane he had chartered to fly from Orange County to Vegas, he smoked so much marijuana that smoke and fumes entered the cockpit,
[01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:40.960]   forcing the pilot to dot an oxygen mask.
[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:44.960]   Could you please turn off your Kindle and put the doobie down?
[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:54.960]   Yeah, but I mean, on one hand, the only reason this is a story is because it's a CEO at Broadcom.
[01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:57.960]   I mean, if this was a rock star or any of a lot of people...
[01:06:57.960 --> 01:06:58.960]   Good point.
[01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:02.960]   There are scumbags everywhere, and this is all horrible and terrible and wrong.
[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:09.960]   But the reality is, the only reason this is a story on Twitch is because it's somebody who has a distance from the technology industry.
[01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:10.960]   Well, that's why.
[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:11.960]   It's been an honest...
[01:07:11.960 --> 01:07:13.960]   And Aaron's can't be scumbags, too.
[01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:19.960]   I don't know about you guys, but I haven't in a long time, but I used to be in that culture.
[01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:20.960]   Really?
[01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:22.960]   About 20, 25 years ago.
[01:07:22.960 --> 01:07:23.960]   Okay.
[01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:29.960]   And there is one thing that you learn about drugs. It really does affect your judgment.
[01:07:29.960 --> 01:07:32.960]   He built a cave.
[01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:36.960]   In fact, there's actually a picture of him giving a tour.
[01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:38.960]   I gotta show you guys.
[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:39.960]   This is the cave.
[01:07:39.960 --> 01:07:40.960]   Oh, yeah.
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:41.960]   He built a cave.
[01:07:41.960 --> 01:07:42.960]   Oh, this is great.
[01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:45.960]   He's a picture of him in the telegraph showing off his tunnel under his house.
[01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:49.960]   He looks like Vincent Price in the...
[01:07:49.960 --> 01:07:51.960]   I mean, this is crazy stuff.
[01:07:51.960 --> 01:07:52.960]   Darth Vader.
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:54.960]   The other reason this is a big story.
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:08:00.960]   It is a tech story because he drugged other tech executives or is alleged to have drugged other tech executives.
[01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:06.960]   But also it's a story because he's got so much money that guys a multi-billionaire that...
[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:11.960]   I mean, he could do more than the average bear.
[01:08:11.960 --> 01:08:14.960]   He's got more money than Mick Jagger.
[01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:15.960]   And he can...
[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:18.960]   Yeah, but all the Jagger's victims are voluntary.
[01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:19.960]   Good point.
[01:08:19.960 --> 01:08:22.960]   We're happy about their experience in the end.
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:23.960]   Right.
[01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:24.960]   This is made.
[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:27.960]   This is made that backgating leads to harder stuff.
[01:08:27.960 --> 01:08:28.960]   Apparently.
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:30.960]   Backgating's a gateway drug.
[01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:31.960]   Yeah, they're watching.
[01:08:31.960 --> 01:08:35.960]   They seem to have a very special announcement tomorrow.
[01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:42.960]   And then finally, if you were going to write the story of Nolan Bushnell's life and make a movie of it,
[01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:44.960]   who would you pick?
[01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:51.960]   What Hollywood star would you pick to star in the biopic of Nolan Bushnell, the founder of Atari?
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:57.960]   Of course, everyone knows Leonardo DiCaprio.
[01:08:57.960 --> 01:09:00.960]   They look alike.
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:02.960]   Sure.
[01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:03.960]   Yeah.
[01:09:03.960 --> 01:09:04.960]   All right.
[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:05.960]   That's enough.
[01:09:05.960 --> 01:09:07.960]   That's our gossip section for today.
[01:09:07.960 --> 01:09:11.960]   I don't want to make you guys crazy nuts.
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:13.960]   Can we go back to technology with you?
[01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:14.960]   I just couldn't resist that.
[01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:15.960]   That's great.
[01:09:15.960 --> 01:09:16.960]   That's great.
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:17.960]   Chuck E. Cheese.
[01:09:17.960 --> 01:09:18.960]   Yes.
[01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:19.960]   Oh, yeah.
[01:09:19.960 --> 01:09:20.960]   Hey, guys.
[01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:21.960]   You see, I knew it.
[01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:22.960]   I chased Patrick away.
[01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:23.960]   Well, that's fine.
[01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:25.960]   No, actually, I think the baby just exploded.
[01:09:25.960 --> 01:09:28.960]   Oh, oh, stand clear of the baby.
[01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:29.960]   Oh, the humanity.
[01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:30.960]   Thank you, Patrick.
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:31.960]   My pleasure.
[01:09:31.960 --> 01:09:41.960]   Catch Patrick, of course, at Tekzilla and System on Revision3.com/Tekzilla and Revision3.com/SYSTM.
[01:09:41.960 --> 01:09:43.960]   And now, daily tech news from Tekzilla.
[01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:44.960]   Yeah.
[01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:45.960]   Daily tech tips, actually.
[01:09:45.960 --> 01:09:46.960]   Hands-on tech tips.
[01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:51.960]   Windows, OS X, Firefox, Internet Explorer, all that good stuff.
[01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:52.960]   That's so much more.
[01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:53.960]   That's the good stuff.
[01:09:53.960 --> 01:09:54.960]   Well, thank you very much, Patrick.
[01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:56.960]   I really appreciate your being here.
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:57.960]   Take care, guy.
[01:09:57.960 --> 01:09:58.960]   You too.
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:09:59.960]   And we'll send you that.
[01:09:59.960 --> 01:10:03.960]   Don't tell the other guys, but we'll send you that audible comp deal.
[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:04.960]   Just a little bit.
[01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:09.960]   Actually, this is a good time to wrap it up because I think we've got all the sleeves we can handle.
[01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:14.960]   Steve Gilmore, your predictions for tomorrow, the World Wide Developers Conference.
[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:19.960]   I think it's going to be over really quickly and we'll all be seeing, pressing refresh
[01:10:19.960 --> 01:10:22.960]   for most of the morning and we'll have a good time.

[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:42.960]   I feel like we could have you early to be here.
[01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:44.960]   We're in the studio and on Twitch.
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:45.960]   We really appreciate it.

[01:10:47.960 --> 01:10:49.960]   Don't forget Steve Gilmore does the news.
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:51.960]   You do so much now.
[01:10:51.960 --> 01:10:53.960]   You're doing the News Gang every day, right?
[01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:54.960]   Yep.
[01:10:54.960 --> 01:10:56.960]   And that's NewsGang.net.
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:03.960]   Well, that's News Gang is on both of these shows are now on hosted by TechCrunch.
[01:11:03.960 --> 01:11:04.960]   That's right.
[01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:07.960]   So where's the best place to go to here?
[01:11:07.960 --> 01:11:09.960]   GilmoreGang.TechCrunch.com.
[01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:10.960]   Got it.
[01:11:10.960 --> 01:11:11.960]   I'll change your CG for the next time you're on it.
[01:11:11.960 --> 01:11:17.960]   NewsGang.net is a service that collects hot tech stories.
[01:11:17.960 --> 01:11:21.960]   It's a great place to find what's going on.
[01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:24.960]   Gilmore is G-I-L-L-M-O-R.
[01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:27.960]   GilmoreGang.TechCrunch.net.
[01:11:27.960 --> 01:11:34.960]   And of course the Gilmore Gang is heard what day of the week.
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:35.960]   Is it coming out?
[01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:36.960]   Every day.
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:37.960]   You do it every day now?
[01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:38.960]   Uh-huh.
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:42.960]   Wow. You do the NewsGang every day and the Gilmore Gang every day?
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:46.960]   Yeah, I'm trying to sort of catch up to you, which I'll never do.
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:48.960]   Well, I'm going to start running faster.
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:50.960]   And of course he now has a blog on ZD.net.
[01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:51.960]   What's the address of that?
[01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:52.960]   Oh, I don't know.
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:55.960]   I'm writing on TechCrunch on Saturdays.
[01:11:55.960 --> 01:11:56.960]   Oh, yeah.
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:01.960]   I saw an article on TechCrunch by you that it was actually, it was Buzzword Layton.
[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:02.960]   I really--
[01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:07.960]   Yes, I'm challenging the ability to piss off the tech.
[01:12:07.960 --> 01:12:10.960]   I think you did a little bit.
[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:13.960]   It's been really exciting.
[01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:20.960]   I saw one comment on Facebook that said, "I don't even understand what language this is."
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:21.960]   It was a lot of fun.
[01:12:21.960 --> 01:12:22.960]   Steve, it's great to talk to you.
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:23.960]   Always good to have you on the show.
[01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:24.960]   Thank you so much for having me.
[01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:25.960]   Take care.
[01:12:25.960 --> 01:12:26.960]   Bye-bye, Steve Gilmore.
[01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:27.960]   Randall Schwartz, thanks for coming in.
[01:12:27.960 --> 01:12:28.960]   Really great to have you.
[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:29.960]   Thank you.
[01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:31.960]   And thanks to all of you for joining us.
[01:12:31.960 --> 01:12:32.960]   Another Twit.
[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:33.960]   He's in the can.
[01:12:33.960 --> 01:12:38.960]   He's in the can.
[01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:44.960]   [Music]
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:46.960]   Hey, I'm a Kermit the Frog here.
[01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:47.960]   Can I get the Kermit the Frog?
[01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:49.960]   What do you see in time?
[01:12:49.960 --> 01:12:52.960]   This is Randall, here with This Week in Tech.
[01:12:52.960 --> 01:12:56.960]   Someday we'll find it the Rainbow Connection.
[01:12:56.960 --> 01:13:00.960]   The Lovers, the Dreamers, and me.
[01:13:00.960 --> 01:13:02.960]   I should pay attention.
[01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:03.960]   Too much work.
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:05.960]   The problem is, there's no limit.
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:06.960]   My server's completely collapsed.
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:07.960]   So here's the deal.
[01:13:07.960 --> 01:13:12.960]   I'm just trying to get the thing off, but I have a hell of a time when blue screens like forget it.
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:15.960]   I'm killing you.
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:20.960]   [Music]
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:22.960]   I'm on the Twit.
[01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:23.960]   I'm on the Twit.
[01:13:23.960 --> 01:13:24.960]   Alright.
[01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:26.960]   I'm on the Twit, baby.
[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:27.960]   Do as a twin.
