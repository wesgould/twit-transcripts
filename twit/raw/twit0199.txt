[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   It's time for TWiT, the show that covers all things technology and a great panel we have here, assembled around the table virtually, so to speak, from his getaway in beautiful Washington State, John C. Dvorak.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   Hello.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   Hey, John, good to talk to you.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Also, just back from his getaway, he had a nice, I hope, vacation, Dwight Silverman of the Houston Chronicle.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Hey, Dwight.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Hey, it's good to be back and great to be doing this as my first semi-official act back after taking my daughter up to orientation at the University of Missouri.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Oh, that's where she's going, huh? That's great. Congratulations.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   So, I remember the last time we, a few months ago, we talked, you were doing college tours and getting ready for all that.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   And so, she's going to you, what do you call it, Old Mizzou, is that it?
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   It's called Mizzou, right?
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Mizzou.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   Incredibly, incredibly rich in tradition.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   And it's a school that started homecoming, and it is the first, it was the first journalism school, the US.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   She's not going to study journalism.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Yes, she is.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   Yes, as much as I try to dissuade her, that's what she wants to do.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   She must be very worried and proud.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   But yes.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   And buggy whip manufacturing.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   There's a future in buggy whips, kids.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   But she's going into the convergence, she's going to do, she's going to focus on online, so at least she's taking the right track.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Well, I think it's actually great. I mean, you still need the traditions of journalism.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   You still need the ethics, the background. I think that's, I mean, online journalists are still journalists.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   It's just because the dead tree newspapers going away doesn't mean that we don't need journalists.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Right, right.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   Also here, Doug Kaye, the proto-podcaster, the guy who I think you are now officially the longest continuous running podcaster in the world.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   You didn't say oldest podcaster. Thank you.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   You're not the oldest, I guarantee you.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   It is the longest. Yeah, six years old.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Six years.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   IT conversations.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Six years last week.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   He's also at conversationsnetwork.org and has really been one of the people who's really forwarded this medium.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   You were way ahead of the, you knew.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   If you don't count yourself and about a half a dozen other people.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Yeah, but you're discounting 20 years of radio.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Does radio count when you're talking to new media?
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   It's all the same. You're sitting around talking to a microphone, right?
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   I guess. I guess. It is kind of actually all the same.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   It's great to have you back. You haven't been on in ages.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   I haven't. Somebody said to me today, "Weren't you just on Twitter?" I said, "No, it's been nine months."
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Nine months.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   I've been coding. I've been busy.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   You still code.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Yes. Well, no, I code again.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   You're back to.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   Well, I went for 15 or 20 years with no coding as an executive.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   What are you writing?
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   I was an executive. What am I writing? PHP. Yeah. I'm doing a new site.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Cool.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Anyway, yeah.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   I'll ask you about it later. Yeah.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   Also here, Mr. Will Harris from the UK. He's in studio, which is very nice.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Watcher, fellas.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Out with his watcher.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Wait a minute. Doug said that he's been saying, "Hello."
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   Hello.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   Hello. And you've now started, you're starting a new trend. Is that it?
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Yeah. It's going to be a watcher, fellas, from now on.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   Watcher, fellas.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   I've got my, my wife is now saying hello and she doesn't know where it came from.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   She walks around saying the same thing.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Hello.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Hello.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   What can I say? I'm the king of slightly camp catchphrases.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   My new catchphrase, "Screw you." That's good. It's very useful.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Did I hear a mashup on that?
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Yeah. There's been a, there've been a bunch of mashups. Endless series of mashups.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   This is the.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   Oh, I want a T-shirt.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Leo says.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   You know what would be funny is to do.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Leo says, "Screw you."
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   Leo told me, "Screw you." It'd be like a, you know, a special small club.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   So a couple of stories. Actually, John, you had something you wanted to talk about.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   What was it? What was that? I forgot now.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   I did too.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Okay. So we'll start.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   The pre. The pre.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   The pre. You want to talk about the pre. It's been out for a week.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Oh yeah. So I got my hands on one finally.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   Was yours free?
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   It wasn't mine. It was somebody else's. I borrowed it.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   Oh, good.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   I didn't even get one free or pay for one or get one loaned to me or anything.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Did you have a time that you had to give it back?
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Was it ascertained before you took it?
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   I had to give it back to the guy. I don't like it.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   No, that's the solution. Go through a middleman, Leo.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   If you have a middleman, then you're never responsible. They can't get to you.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   I just get John to get everything for me.
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   So you don't like it.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   No, I think the keyboard's unusable. I think the device has got, you know,
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   what's the difference between that and an Android?
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   I like the fit and finish. I think it's kind of cool.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   It's got a nice little rubbery background and the screen feels really nice
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   when you move things around on it.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   But I'm not seeing that it's anything out of the ordinary.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   It's a little late to the game. I think it's late to the party.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   I know that Sprint set new records for sales and all these kinds of things happen,
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   but I, you know, I'm not seeing this thing save in the company, to be honest about it.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   Well, there is a challenge.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   It's going to be tough. Verizon has now apparently,
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   well, Verizon's president said we're going to carry it.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   They're saying now the scuttlebutt is January 1st.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Does that change your attitude if Verizon sells this as well as Sprint?
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   No, I don't care about the carrier, to be honest, but I'm just talking about the phone per se.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   I don't know. I think a lot of people that would say the best thing about the pre is that it's a usable
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   smartphone that's not on AT&T because the number one complaint I hear about the iPhone repeatedly
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   over here anyway is that AT&T is just not the carrier that people want to use.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   And so even if it's only half as good as the iPhone, it's twice as good as most other smartphones out there.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   And so to get it on Verizon and Sprint is an automatic win for a lot of people that don't want AT&T.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   I talk to, you know, when anybody says I want to stay on Sprint, I say, oh, you got to get the pre.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   I mean, that is the, it's number two. I'm going to say it's the second best.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   I mean, to me, it's all about the apps. That's the big difference.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   And there are very few apps, although more apps on this than when the iPhone shipped, the first iPhone.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   Well, there were no apps than when the iPhone shipped.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Well, that's not saying anything, is it?
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   The apps are something that actually make a phone something that becomes more valuable over time.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   And there aren't that many phones you can say become more valuable over time.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   I like the form factor, John. I feel like it's like a little pebble.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   It was supposed to be a river rock. And I think they've kind of done that.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   It multitasks, which the iPhone doesn't do.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   It's got a very good camera, which the iPhone didn't have until Monday. Now, of course, the iPhones leapfrog it.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   They not only have a camera of equal quality, the new 3GS, you look at the picture, you tap the person you want it to focus on and it focuses it.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   That's something even a digital camera can't do. And it's going to have video that you can edit in phones.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   That's a very nice segue to the news of the week.
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Well, that's the news of the week, but also the news of the week, which is what you were saying, which is that people hate AT&T.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   People are not blaming Apple for the price, but they are blaming AT&T because a lot of people bought an iPhone exactly one year ago and they're going to be paying $499 and $599.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Yeah. And it's the same in the UK as well.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Is it?
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   The official carry in the UK has come under such a lot of heat, especially for gouging on the data tethering charges.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   But to be fair, that would be true of any carrier. Anybody, what carrier is going to let you have a two year plan and walk in after one year and get a new phone at a discount? They don't do that.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   Should?
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   Yeah, that's just the standard way that AT&T handles its smartphone upgrades. It's really not that unusual.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   Is it just AT&T though?
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   Everybody does that.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   Right, everybody does it that way.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   I guarantee you, if a year from now you want to buy a new pre, you'll be paying four or five hundred bucks.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   I don't understand why these carriers, given that they've got people wanting to give them money, surely the sensible thing to do would be to make sure, okay, you can have a subsidized upgrade, but you've always got to keep a two year contract.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   There you go.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   You've always got to make sure you push it out into it.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   Or pro rate.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   Either pro rate it or keep it pushed out to a two year. So you can upgrade in six months, but then you've got to add another six months to your contract. Or you can upgrade in 18 months, you've got to add another 18 months.
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   But you know, you'd have to look at the economics. I'm not trying to defend the carriers, but you have to look at it and recognize that they counted on a certain amount of revenue for all those sales.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   The phones are underwritten and the question is, can they really do that within the economics of the plan? I don't know.
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   So what were you about to say?
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   Well, you know, it's funny that whenever the iPhone comes up, and for example, there was some of this during the introduction of the first iPhone, that what people end up talking about is how crappy AT&T is.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   Yes.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   You remember David Pogue's video for the first iPhone where he's explaining the iPhone to his colleagues at the New York Times. There's a big crowd around him and he mentions, and it's only on AT&T and everybody goes, aww.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   And I think that one of the problems with this, with the iPhone is, is that every time it's mentioned, it shows off or emphasizes the weaknesses of AT&T. I think in some ways the iPhone is bad for AT&T's reputation.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   Well, but what was it? 30% of iPhone owners are new AT&T customers. I mean, it certainly has not been bad for business.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Bad for their reputation? What reputation?
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   But is there somebody we love? I mean, come on. Aren't all cell phone carriers sleazy?
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   Well, here's something interesting. I just, you know, I went to Missouri and that requires traveling through the wilds of North Texas and Oklahoma.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   And AT&T has no 3G there and sometimes there's not even the edge network in some of those locations. And I took with me the Verizon MiFi and used that to talk to Verizon's network with my iPhone.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   And it was dramatically better.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   Oh dear.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   It was kind of like, here's what the iPhone is like. Here's what the iPhone would be like on Verizon.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   And it was much, much better. And I think that if, when the iPhone's exclusivity with AT&T ends and Verizon is able to strike a deal with Apple, I think the stampede is going to begin.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   2010 it ends.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   Unless they get an extension.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   It'll be, yeah. It'll be interesting. You know, is it in Apple's interest? Isn't it in Apple's interest to dump or not dump, but at least diversify?
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   Open it up. Well again, it comes back to this question of Doug's about the economics. If it makes more economic sense for AT&T to keep paying Apple to have it.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   Well, it probably does. Yeah.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   But how much? But see, you know, for instance, you know, here's Phil Schiller talking about we're going to have tethering on the new 3GS and we're going to have MMS on the new 3GS.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   And he shows all the carriers are going to support MMS. No AT&T. He shows all the characters are going to show tethering. Rogers, T-Mobile, Orange. No, no AT&T.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   He's with the 3GS you're saying. Yeah.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   Which implies that. AT&T says, well, we'll have it later this summer.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   Well, that implies that they'll eventually get it. Right. In 2010.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   Someday. Someday. Someday my MMS will come.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   I mean, thank goodness there's some competitive pressure. Unfortunately, those of us with iPhones are going to just suffer for another year.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   Well, so here's the question. I mean, how many people are going to buy or going to bite the bullet?
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   I already did. I'll tell you the truth. As usual. As usual. And buy the new 3GS even though I'm not out of contract.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   I'm waiting my second year. I've got a 3G. Me too. I'll wait a year. You're going to wait a year. Yeah.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   Yeah, there's not a way to year also. There's not enough for me to go.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   I mean, I like it if I didn't cost anything. You know what? The big announcement really was the $99 3G.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   The 8G 3G. That's remarkable. That is going to be very good for AT&T and very good for Apple.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   Unless you just bought one of the 8 gigs for $199. Yeah, which I did, of course. Yes. And for my son.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   And you know, now I'm screwed. Well, see, what I did, I bought a 3G. I ordered a 3GS for my son.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   So that's my way of getting. Well, you did get one then. Yeah, but I get to play with it and I get to, you know, all that.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   You know what? There's some features I like. I love the idea that you can leave the phone in a restaurant.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   And then the GPS says, oh, look, this is where you left it. And then you call the restaurant and you said, hello, I left my phone there.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   Do you hear a screaming sound coming from the cushion in the booth in the back? That's my phone. Go get it.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   You press a button and this phone goes, yeah. All right. So that begs a question, though.
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   Do you leave location services turned on all the time? Well, I don't know.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   Do you need them? We'll see. Friday I'll get this. We'll let you know what you need. Yeah, you need it.
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   Do you leave your. Dead as a doornail in 10 minutes. It sucks. Dead as a doornail in 10 minutes.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   Yeah, it sucks battery. You know, it just it just pulls it right. Yeah. And they say twice.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   You have to have mobile me. You need mobile me to make that work. Right.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   Of course, because I'm a complete fool. I have a mobile me. Well, I also have a mobile me.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   Oh, you do. I thought you were kidding. You do need mobile me for that. Oh, yeah.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   Oh, my God. They got to put. They got to give you some reason to buy that.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   Well, that's the reason to buy it. Right. Now, you know, there's a few other things.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   And you can do the you can automatically lock it if it gets stolen and you can put a little message on it saying, you know, if I've lost this phone, please call your home number.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   So there are a few little brucy bonuses in there that, you know, make mobile me. I use back to my Mac.
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   I like that. Wait, my Mac works. According to one of the Mavens on the Twitter, I see he says it doesn't scream.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   It just beeps. Yeah, he's tried it. It's a loud, annoying beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   It just beeps. Yeah, he's tried it. It's a loud, annoying beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   I'm on the PC and it lost my paper. It's very funny. It was like it's a classic. Yeah. I'll play it at the end of the show. You can be the judge. You be the judge. When we come back, Will Harris is going to say, so what are you going to say?
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   I'm a den a job and I'm a dinner jacket and I'm a dinner jacket and Musavi. Yeah. Yeah. We're going to talk about Iran and the colossal CNN fail of the week.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   But before we do that, I want to mention our friends at GoToMeeting. GoToMeeting from Citrix is the online meeting service that's just so easy to use and saves you money.
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:52.000]   How how can a product that costs fifty dollars a month save you money? Well, how much do you spend on business travel?
[00:15:52.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   You know, a ticket across the country, three hundred bucks, not to mention the stress, the time wasted.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   Even driving across town today as gas prices go up again is expensive.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   That's why GoToMeeting is a money saver, a time saver, a stress saver. Hold your meetings online. By the way, these meetings are more engaging, more fun.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   People appreciate it. It's not like, you know, people are going to say, oh, you didn't come to visit us. Frankly, they don't want you to come visit.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   They're going to buy you dinner. Come on, let's admit it, right? They got to entertain you.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   That's no fun. Stay home and have a GoToMeeting for sales presentations, for product demos, for training.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   I use it to collaborate. We use it on the Maxwell's House podcast because he could show his screens, beautiful, high quality screens.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   Just about any kind of conference call is easier and better with GoToMeeting, by the way, including it includes free voice over the Internet and free telephone teleconferencing.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   It's the most secure way, the easiest way. And I want you to try it right now. GoToMeeting.com/twit. G-O-T-O-Meeting.com/twit.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   These guys are fantastic. They've been real supporters of the Twitter network.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   So if you support the Twitter network also, give it a try. GoToMeeting.com/twit. I think you'll find a lot of ways to use it.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   I'm a dinner jacket. What is it? I'm a dinner jacket.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   So this is the CNN fail of the week, right?
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   Of the week. This is, I think you could say this might be a turning point. No, look at here. Here I'm Saturday afternoon.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   You know, I went home after the radio show. You're seeing on Twitter just, I mean, literally live people saying I'm being tear gassed right now.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   You even can see Musavi's tweeting saying they've got me under house arrest. I'm going, oh my God, this is huge.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   The election is being stolen in Iran. Quick turn on CNN. It's a Larry King rerun with American Chopper.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   There's guys without slaves talking about motorcycles. Oh, well, geez, maybe MSNBC. They're talking about prisoners.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   They're doing it like documentary. They're sleaze-o documentaries about people in jail. Maybe Fox?
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   No, they got a rerun on to nobody. None of the news stations were covering this story all day Saturday.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:15.000]   But if you go to Twitter now, admittedly, you're not getting news on Twitter, but you're getting, I mean, the stuff as it happens.
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   It turns out that in Tehran, of course, for those who don't know, I'm a dinner jacket decided that he won the election even, you know, regardless of what the actual vote is.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   Although, well, I'm going to raise some issues about that, but we don't know.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   The most supporters of Musabi, who really the Green Revolution, I mean, they were really progressive Iranians, at least in the cities.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   And I think that's the issue here. Were burning cars. They were protesting. They were being shut down.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   The Iranian authorities immediately turned off text messaging. They blocked Twitter on the Internet.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   They did everything they could to keep it from getting out. But people still had Twitter applications on their phones and tweets were still getting out.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   And if you were reading these tweets, you were watching a revolution in the streets live in real time. And meanwhile, CNN.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   Well, if you want to build a motorcycle, I did see one news crew. I think it might have been NBC who was in Tehran, who was videotaping, had their videotapes taken away by the police and they covered it with their mobile phones.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   So they actually covered it and sent footage back and you see the burning. And to CNN's credit this morning on GPS, they did very good coverage. Christiane Amanpour was there.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:32.000]   She's Iranian. So, I mean, there are people there. The New York Times, though, did a brilliant job. It's ironic.
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   The newspapers did a brilliant job on their websites. And so my point is that I think this might be a turning point. If you want to see breaking news, you go to the Web now.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   You do not turn on the news station. And it's not just that. I mean, first of all, there's another irony, which of course is that when the people did start to catch up, what did they do?
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   They read Twitter on the air. Yeah. That was their source. But it's not just a matter of a change in media. It's a matter of changing source.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   You actually are getting you're getting this information not from reporters, but from the first person, from the people who are Iranians who are there.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   That's almost as big. Maybe that's a bigger story or a bigger issue than the fact that the media didn't cover it. Right. The fact that this is citizen journalism.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   Yeah. Well, it does raise an issue. And this is the second issue I wanted to raise is that you're getting the point of view from the cities, from the people in Tehran.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   And it may be in fact, Ahmadinejad did win the election because he won in the countryside where people don't have Twitter. You know, we will never know who actually won the election.
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   Right. I mean, I'm just pointing out that the Twitterati in Iran may be a very small group compared to the overall electorate.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   So you don't you get first person news, but you get it, you know, kind of. Yeah, but you get, you know, you get analysis.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   Yeah, but you get a large number of people supplying this information. That's true.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   And if you if you looked at the hashtag Iran election, in fact, today, if you look at it, there's still stuff going on.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   Half a minute ago, the riot police are now shooting at protesters. I mean, this is this is still going on.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   Well, when you say you get news, but not analysis, Leo news is not analysis ever. OK.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   This reportage is actually accounts for news of some sorts, eyewitness accounts, which I think is quite valuable.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   By the way, Christine Amnouppour is Lebanese, I think.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   They said on CNN that she was she was born in Iran. But anyway, OK, she's certainly on the ground there and doing a great job, as was, by the way, a New York Times reporter who was I mean, there's a dramatic video on the web of him up on the roof saying we had to get off the streets.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   You know, here's what's going on. And that was yesterday. They were on. They were doing video on the web.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   The New York Times yesterday, they were doing great coverage. And you know, have you seen any kind of explanation as to why CNN and Fox and MSNBC did not cut away and try to provide live coverage?
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   Have any of them kind of addressed the anger and the questions that people have? I saw one crew was saying that any time there were more than two people together, they were being beaten by police.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   I mean, they I think it was I think it was a they couldn't know they were not able to cover it.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   And I think that comes back. I want to just go back to this one more time. I won't beat this to death. But the fact is that we often talk about comparing people who are tweeting to CNN.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   And I think the comparison isn't valid. I wouldn't even make the comparison. We're just going to have to get used to the fact that whatever we want to call it, news or journalism or something else, we are going to get a lot more information from things like Twitter in the future.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:53.000]   And I'm not sure that we need to spend a lot of time trying to figure out what it is. We just need to we need to embrace it because it's going to be there.
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   It's a very you know, in this case, it's an important source. This is from silence no more. This came out a minute ago.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   We want to keep tweeting. This is the only place the real news is getting out. I mean, this is a very I think remarkable.
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   The source of the information direct from Iran. Somebody in the chat room, I didn't see the whole thing, but mentioned the Daily Show. Did you see a thing last week where they went and talked to the New York Times?
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   Did you see it? Oh, God, great. In the interview, interviewed a guy at the Times and he says, so tell me, you know, this is a daily newspaper.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   What in your newspaper happened today? Is there anything in your paper today? No, it's all yesterday.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   And that's a that's a fundamental issue right there, isn't it? But there's a real daily newspaper means it comes out.
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   It's like one hour cleaners. A guy goes, he says, it's one hour cleaners. No, that's just the name of the place.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   Twenty four hour fitness. We're not open at night. But if you needed it, the fact is that you're you're talking about somebody who is, you know, if you want to sit back and not see the world in real time, but you want to see the world as it was a day ago.
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:24:02.000]   That's a valid. Well, I think in a way of Newsweek did this about I read the Times every day. Don't get me to write Newsweek about a month ago said we give up.
[00:24:02.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   We can't cover it. We're a weekly. We can't possibly cover news as fast as it's happening.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   So we're going to become an analysis magazine. I don't know if you've looked at Newsweek lately, but it is not the same magazine.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   I think that that maybe that's what CNN's doing. Maybe they don't have the budget to do anything but reruns on the weekends.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   Certainly MSNBC. That's what they were doing. But I think the problem is it purports to be real time. Well, we know now it's not.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   You know, the whole point of a 24 hour news channel is CNN breaking news is 24 hour news. As John says, it's just the name.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   Yeah. So it's it seems really strange that there's something that's set up.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   You know, we're always talking about how we live in this 24 hour news culture, but it seems that even that is now not enough.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   Like we need like a second to second news culture. Well, there's you know, stuff happens real time and the Internet has connected us in a way real time.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   You know, when when Iran you when you had to send a telegraph dispatch from Iran, you know, you're not going to have real time news, but we can now thanks to the Internet really be real time.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   And I think that's that's very powerful. We're we're tied together.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   There are there were some people who said that what CNN should have done was gone on the air.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   And even if they couldn't report, if they couldn't get any video was to begin working with the social media and reporting what was being said there and try to provide some context.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   And they might even have been able to do real time verification of some of the things that were being said because they do have reporters there.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:31.000]   And so it just struck me and others who were watching it is very odd is that they did not cut away.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   This was the network that cut its teeth on cutting away.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   And on Saturday night, you know, everybody was taking the night off.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   And I think that that struck a lot. You know, what happens is people see this initially on Twitter, on social networks, and then they go to television to get it live as it's put together and put together and get pictures.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   Right. And that failed them.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   And that's exactly right.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   Just see that that process failed.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   Twitter was the early warning system and we expected then the follow up on news. Right. So what happens when Iranians in the streets of Tehran have can initiate live streaming video from their phone.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   Which is imminent. Right. Then you'll say, you know, I'm sorry, I'm not going to go.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   You know, think of the things that you've done, the live video events.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   Think of Scoble standing at the iPhone, the first iPhone thing in New York or where Palo Alto was.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   I mean, at some point, the event is the coverage through a streaming mobile device and you don't go anywhere else because you're not going to get closer to the action.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   I think that's really interesting because the word that you had there was like coverage.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   And it's true because, you know, you can have lots of Iranians on the streets of Tehran with streaming mobile phones and you can see what's happening.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   But nobody can really kind of tell you what that means or put it together.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   But you're getting the raw material.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   You're getting the raw material. Sure.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   And then you've got somebody like Leo who will sit here and he will watch a half a dozen video streams from a half a dozen people in Tehran.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   And he'll switch back and forth and he'll be the anchor slash technical director.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   Well, I do notice that nobody will get on it.
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   Well, I do notice nobody's doing a live tech coverage.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   And I do think that that's an opening for me in a very poor man's way to do coverage of that kind of thing.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   I don't know if I'll ever be covering revolutions in Iran.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   Is that timely?
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   Well, some of it's not. Some of it is. So we have this kind of programming, which is, you know, we're covering last this week's news.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   We're not covering today's news. Well, we are a little bit, but it's not this this minute in tech.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   Yeah. But on the other hand, if a big DDoS attack happened all of a sudden on Yahoo or if Microsoft announced that it was getting out of business, we'd go to we'd cover it live and we could.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   We'd have the capability to do.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   You and I have talked about this before, a live anchored control room, and I can see that I think that's where we're headed and it's going to be a mobile devices and you'll you'll cut away to somebody.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   We'll be able to pull from all these sources.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   And then in 10 years time, there'll be somebody else sitting in a room going, Leo Laporte, I can't believe he didn't cut away to that story.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   Ten years, ten minutes, ten minutes.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   But that's the beauty of it is now anybody can do it. It's not expensive.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   And and and if that coverage is out there now, what about but now here's the issue.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   What how does stringers make any money anymore?
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   Do they make any money? Who's going to pay him? I'm not going to pay him.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   No, but again, you're comparing it to an old system.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   So the whole system falls.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   You're trying to you're trying to shoehorn it into the old system.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   The whole system falls.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   I mean, I was going to ask a question amongst this during this little debate here.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   Yes.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   What's the rush? What's the rush?
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:40.000]   Why do we need to know what's happening in Tehran?
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   This very, you know, that's a very good question.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   It's not that John, it's got nothing.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   It's going to have no effect on our lives at the moment.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   We could sit back and wait for it to be analyzed and we'd probably get more out of it.
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:53.000]   What is the rush?
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   I understand that, John.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   But the fact is, I think there's a human nature aspect.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   Why do we watch car chases on television in Los Angeles?
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   I don't.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   I know, but I will fess up to the fact that I have done that.
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   I have been in Los Angeles where that seems to be the other have a car chase channel down there, don't you think?
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   Anyway, I've watched car chases.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   I have one.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   They really should because it's pretty much 24/7.
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   Yeah. And the fact is, there's a sense of immediacy.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   There's the fact that I want to I want to know when something happens.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   And I think that's inevitable.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   I think there's some compelling reasons to do this in real time.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   You know, this is a scoop mentality that always leads to bad information.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   It's dangerous.
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:33.000]   And that was kind of what I was making.
[00:29:33.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   This isn't the scoop.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   This is the raw material.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   This is as it happens.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   It's a scoop.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   I still see it as a scoop.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   It's only one person perspective from one spot.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   He's delivering maybe a picture or something like that.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   It's a scoop.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   Surely it's the anti-scoop because at that point, because a scoop is one person has some exclusive information.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   Twitter is everybody can see what everybody is.
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   You have disintermediated the scooper.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   That's going to be the title for today's show.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   Yeah, that's it.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:05.000]   Exactly.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   Disintermediation is what it's all about.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   I think, John, you're also doing the same thing I did, which is kind of interpreting it through the lens of old media.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   And I think what we what might just as a possibility for how it might end up playing out is the thing happens.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   The fire.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   You see the pictures live.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   There's a swarm of attention around it.
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   There are people putting the story out.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:27.000]   People watch it.
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   Think about it.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   A conversation starts around it.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   That's what we're seeing on places like Friend Feed where people start analyzing it themselves and consensus is reached through these conversations that happen over a period of a day or two or three that actually in the end, I think produces a better understanding of the story than waiting a day and reading what the New York Times has to say about.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   I spoke at a conference last week, the Beyond Broadcast Conference.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   And this is primarily people in public media, the public radio, public television, as well as academic journalism.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   And I came away with it from the same sensitive I get all the time at these events, which is there's still such a sense of preserving, you know, try to understand new media in the sense of how do we adapt what we have to new media instead of going directly to the media.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   Right.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   You know, how do we keep the jobs is, of course, one way to look at it.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   But that's always the case.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   Look at the record industry.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   If you've built a business around a business, I'm starting to understand this now having a business. When you build a business around a business model, it's ducibly hard to change the business model underneath the business.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   Right.
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:47.000]   You've kind of, you've, the whole thing is set up around, we print these broadsheets that have a display ad on it and some ad copy, and we deliver them via truck to a newsstand where somebody picks it up for 20 cents.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   If that's your business model, it's very hard to say, well, what happens when we get rid of the truck, the newsstand, the broadsheet, the display ad.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   Now what's our business?
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   Well, you know, they'll focus on, well, maybe we should do it by, you know, getting more gas efficient trucks.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   Right.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   I mean, that's, it's very hard.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   And I think Microsoft's got the same problem.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   It's the innovator's dilemma.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   It is true.
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   But I think a big part of the innovator's dilemma is, is that the alternative, the so-called sort of new way of doing things, doesn't generate the same amount of money that the old way of generating things did.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   Not at first.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   Well, possibly not ever.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   Not at first, not ever.
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   Well, if that's it, that's it, so be it.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   If you look at what the New York Times charges, you know, per page, then look at what it can charge online.
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   You physically can't do it.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   You either have to accept the fact that it's a smaller business.
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   I mean, I saw a great statistic out of, from Rupert Murdoch, of all people, last week, saying that the amount of ad of web advertising inventory online doubles every year and has doubled for the past three years.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   And that means that every year it gets doubly as hard to keep an audience and build an audience.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   Your advertising rates halve and you've got double the number of competitors.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   And that's just not true on the newsstand.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   And so it's not a case of adapting old business models.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   I mean, as you say, it's fragmented is what's happening.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   There is no business model for generating something like the New York Times online.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   There is no online publication that can sustain building like this.
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   If the Times goes away, is there a fixed amount of advertising money that's now available and floating around?
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   Yes.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:15.000]   No, it's a decreasing amount of advertising money.
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   Oh, okay. That's the issue.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   The problem is that there are, you know, there is X billion dollars in the advertising market.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   And in the print world, everybody gets, you know, 10% of X billion dollars.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   Right.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:30.000]   Whereas in the online world, everybody gets a thousandth.
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   A thousandth.
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   And the rates are dropping and there's another thousand people.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   So what happens?
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   With every year, will everybody get screwed?
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   Alright, so here's the thing.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   You're all screwed.
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   Not everybody gets, no, not everybody.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   So what's one of the reasons that people think that newspapers have gotten into trouble?
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   Who's the guilty party?
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   Craigslist, right?
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   Craigslist.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   The guilty party are the people who are trying to take this old model and shoehorn it into the internet.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   I think.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   No, that's accurate.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.000]   That's the guilty party.
[00:34:03.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   But who is being blamed?
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   I think Craigslist is getting a fair share of the blame.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   Yes.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   So what would happen?
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   Well, no, it depends on who's talking.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   I don't think, I think a lot of the higher-ups in the newspaper industry are using that as a scapegoat.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   I think those of us who are actually like doing it on websites and still, yes, in print, we kind of understand what I think is really happening.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   And what I think has to happen, and some of us are doing it, we're trying to do that at cron.com, is to change fundamentally what journalists do.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   The classic journalism activity was for a reporter himself or herself to go out, get the story, make sense of it, and distill it.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   Now what I think journalists have to do is we have to be curators of what the community is saying about itself so we can help people make sense of the community covering itself.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   So the comment that was made about somebody like Leo piecing together all the best video and kind of making sense of all the individual streams that are coming out of an event like Tehran,
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   that's where the future of what are called newspapers now will be.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   Aggregation.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   It will be aggregation and curation and it will be done in cities, nationally and globally, and the people who kind of find that model first and hone it and make it palatable are going to be the people who win.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   And we're trying to...
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   Dwight, just as another irony, can you imagine what would happen if Craigslist, who, what do we hear, 100 million in revenues or profits or something?
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   Suppose Craigslist decided to fund some journalistic activities, wouldn't there be a fascinating irony there?
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   Could it be a fine irony? Bring it.
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   I would love to see it too.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   Yeah, well, certainly aggregators are going to be some of the winners.
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   And if you're a big enough aggregator, you'll get a big enough chunk of that old advertising dollar so you might be able to survive.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   And then one hopes that some of that income will trickle down to the stringers and reporters.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:13.000]   It's interesting. There are going to be fewer dollars in the business.
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   The business will show.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   Huffington Post, what did they put aside? A million dollars for investigative journalism?
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   That's not that much.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   Yeah, compared to... what kind of budget is a typical newspaper budget? Is it a lot more?
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   Oh, yes.
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   Yeah, it's millions of dollars.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   Do we lose investigative journalism?
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   The New York Times has got over a thousand people working in its newsroom to produce the daily news.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   Over on MSNBC, we're learning the rates for call girls in New York State.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   Hey!
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   I'm glad that they're covering the big story.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   That's investigative journalism.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   See, this is the problem. These guys... not the Chronicle, obviously, but some of these guys are just shooting themselves in the foot. They don't get it.
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   One of the things we should always mention when we're talking about newspapers and the problems that they're having is the fact of the matter is they are a redundant product.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   And they can maybe blame the Associated Press for part of this and also the New York Times Syndicate, I'm guessing, and perhaps the Washington Post.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   But if you pick up any newspaper around the country, it essentially has the exact same news in it as another paper nearby.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   And when they all go online, it becomes patently obvious that these guys are just...
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   Exactly the same. It's four different rewrites of AP copy.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   Yeah, and you'll see these stories. And if you go to Google News where they show you the number of stories that are similar...
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   A medical...
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   And they break the Iranian story, they'll be like 5,000 stories and they're all the same.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   There's one site that... Dwight, you may know these guys. VoiceofSanDiego.org. Do you know them?
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   Yes.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   Yeah. So this is an interesting sort of transitional group. VoiceofSanDiego.org is a nonprofit investigative journalism organization.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   I think they got started with a particular story uncovering some local scandal and it's become so popular they've received a lot of nonprofit institutional funding and so forth.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   But this is a very lean, mean, low budget investigative journalism site, which I think has a lot going for it. I met some of the people...
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   Your daughter's getting into journalism. She's going to college for journalism. Dwight, are you discouraging her?
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   She knows the reality of it. I mean, she lives in my house.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   She's seen it firsthand.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   She's seen it firsthand. We had 90 layoffs here in the Chronicle newsroom earlier in the year.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   And I did not know if I was going to be on that list. I hope not and I was not, thankfully.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   But she understands it. She's, like I said, she's taking the convergence track and is going to be studying video, audio, is going to be learning to write, is going to be learning to work on the web and report for the web.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   She's already got a very active Twitter account and communicates with other journalists and talks about stories with other professional journalists online.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   So she's doing the right things. It'll be interesting to see what kind of a job she can get when she gets out of there.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   But because that'll be at least four or five years from now. So she's aware of the reality. She also has one eye on law school.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   You know, I was just thinking if I were starting out, especially in California, I would buy a lot of arable land suitable for growing marijuana and maybe get into the bong business because I think marijuana is going to be legalized in about a year.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   I'll pass it on to her.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   Yeah, and I think that's going to be really a great business to be in in the next year in California. Just a thought. Just a thought.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   You know, we're going to take a break when we come back. There are other big stories. The digital transition happened on Friday.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   Three hundred thousand calls to the FCC. Most of them sounded something like this. What happened? My TV is not working.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   We'll also talk about the Facebook land grab. But before we do that, I want to talk about audible.com, the place to go for audio entertainment.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   The greatest books. It's your digital library online. Sixty thousand plus titles, some wonderful literature.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   And I've got a deal for you. This is the platinum deal. I have a platinum account. That's two books a month. Well worth it. I go through two books a month easily.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   And I see one way I'm building a library. The neat thing about audible is those books are yours forever. You can go back to audible, download them again, put them on a different device, plays on everything.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   iPod, Zune, most of the MP3 players, iPhone, of course, even the Kindle and some MP or GPS devices. And and with two books a month, you know, you're building a library audible.com slash twit to.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   That's the place to go to sign up for that gold account. And your first two books are free. Two books free. Well, you said, are you were you listening to some audible?
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   I was. I'm listening to a fantastic book called Making Money by Terry Pratchett. The latest Terry Pratchett. I love Terry. It's a real it's a real return to form.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   There has been a segment in the last couple of years where some of the books have been a little slightly ropey.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   The last couple of books have been really good. A new cast of characters. You can get the abridged version on audible narrated by Tony Robinson of Blackadder fame.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   The Canopy of Money. Yeah, right. You've read it, Doug? No, I've heard about the book. I heard it's excellent.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   It's very scary. Of course, his Alzheimer's and he's writing very slowly right now. But he was. But this is a new book from him. And it's a new book. And I would argue it's definitely one of his best. Oh, isn't that great?
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   So he was saying he was only able to write sometimes a sentence a day. Yeah. So this is a book that a lot of heart and soul put into.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   Wow. So which do you recommend abridged or unabridged? Well, the unabridged is read by Stephen Briggs, who no offense Stephen Briggs is a bit of a no name.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   Oh, as opposed to Tony Robinson, who is a very famous name in. You get two. So get them both. So get them both. They're both free.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   Listen, listen to an audiobook twice. Once abridged, once unabridged. I think that's nothing wrong with that. I'm just thrilled that, you know, much of the Discworld series is on Audible. In fact, I recommended a lot of it is on Audible.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   It's read by Nigel Plainer. Yeah, he does a great job. Fantastic. And of course, of the young ones, another great. Oh, see, I didn't know. I don't know. But she's a wonderful reader.
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   So there you go. Terry Pratchett's Making Money. I'm looking for the abridged version. I see the unabridged here by Stephen Briggs. I wonder if in America, you know what, we may not have. It may be a UK only. Oh, dear. Oh, no, no.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   It says I'm looking on the site and it says it's in dollars. It's definitely it's definitely on there. Oh, dear. I know I'm looking for it. OK, well, I'll find it.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   Making Money. We'll put a link in the show notes. But, you know, any of the Terry Pratchett books would be great. What's the first Discworld one? It was called The Color of Magic.
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   No, The Light Fantastic. No, I think it was a couple. Well, anyway, both of them. Get them both. You get two. Audible.com/twit2. But now we've told you four books and maybe you want to, you know, just get two next month as well.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   Audible.com. I love Audible. I know you will too. It's the greatest. Listen to the books next time you're on the plane, in the car, on the train, stuck doing the laundry, working out in the gym. I listen to Audible all the time. Audible.com/twit2. We thank them so much for their support and thank you, Will, for I had no idea that Making Money was on Audible.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   Well, having just done an 11 hour plane trip, I can attest to the usefulness. And you know how long the unabridged is. You should have got the unabridged 11 hours, 8 minutes. Would it have taken you to the tarmac? That would have just about done it. Just about done it. Maybe for the way home. Listen to it again. Listen to it again. The full unabridged. Usually, I don't mind abridged in nonfiction, but I hate to listen to unabridged novels. I want to hear every word, especially if it took him like a day per sentence. You just like took a year of his life, you know, and threw it on the street and said, I don't need it.
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   Audible.com/twit2 and Sir Terry Pratchett. We love you. Keep writing. We love those books. Have they made movies out of any of them? Rinse Wind?
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   They've made TV movies in England. The TV movies were not quite there.
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   I'd love to see somebody put their heart and soul like the Harry Potter quality.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   It would be Lord of the Rings Harry Potter style. It really should be. And it amazes me that it isn't. I'm sure it's sat in a Hollywood back lot somewhere on somebody's desk optioned.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   Sad. So John, I'm going to give you your choice. You can talk about digital transition or Facebook.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   I'm going to choose something. I'm going to take a third choice. I think it's something we should discuss.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:47.000]   A new car!
[00:44:47.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   Oh, I'm sorry. No, what?
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   Come on down.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   Wait a minute. Let me look under my chair.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   Video game industry sets or hits two year low.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   Yeah, we just got off E3, the big video game convention.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   My son's in that business.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   Is he?
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   Yeah.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:06.000]   What's happening? Is it?
[00:45:06.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   Is it because, well, my daughter who's sitting here, she says it's because there's no, which is what I thought too. There's no good games.
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   They suck.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   What's your son's game?
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   Transformers 2.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   Oh.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   Comes out this month.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   He's working for?
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:21.000]   Activision, I think.
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   Activision.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   He, well, you know, like everybody, he freelances.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   No, is he a design? What is he? What part of it does he do?
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   He's in QA.
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   Oh, cool. So he sits there and plays games all day.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   That's what he, yeah. That's what it sounds like. He wishes it were that easy.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   He had the dream. The dream of every adolescent everywhere someday to get paid to play video games.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   Well, after three years, I don't think it's quite that.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   No, it loses some of its thrill, I'm sure.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   Yeah, they say that it is a bad time right now for the video game industry.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:51.000]   US retailers in May hit the lowest mark in nearly two years.
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   Overall sales dipped below a billion for the first time.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   Now, when you say below a billion, you can't exactly.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   It's a billion per month.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   Per month. It's not exactly, you know, tanking.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   It's not like CD-ROM sales or something.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   I mean, you'd expect in this economy for everything to be down.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   One of the interesting things about the video game business that always fascinates me.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   You wouldn't, wait a minute.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   Is that it's, you know, it's bigger than Hollywood.
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   Oh, yeah. Well, maybe not now, but.
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   No, it is.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   You wouldn't. That's the thing. You wouldn't expect movies to go down in a bad economy or video games.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   These are relatively inexpensive things you can do that, you know, you don't have to leave the house.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   You don't have to go.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   Movies wouldn't have gone down except we now have rental.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   Right. In the 30s, movies did fine.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   Right. Huge.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   But they were only in nickel.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   You couldn't watch them at home.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   So I think another point, I mean, this is a good story in general.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   I think another point for the particular dip in May is the fact that, I mean,
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   May is a really slow time for video game sales.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:47.000]   June is going to take off.
[00:46:47.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   Summer is notoriously bad.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   Oh, summer's bad.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   I mean, summer is great for movies and the flip side being that it's almost always bad for video games.
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   I thought kids getting out of school would help video games,
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   but I guess they don't want to play them if they have homework.
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   I mean, the run up to Christmas, the holiday season is always the huge season.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   There's going to be a bonanza this holiday season.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   Biggest decline, hardware sales, which fell 30 percent from last year.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   Games themselves 23 percent down.
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:17.000]   While there were some very strong new releases this month,
[00:47:17.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   along with continued strong sales of Evergreen games,
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   the top 10 games sold only 2.6 million units compared to 3.7 million last year.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   And you've just got to look at, well, I mean, there's a great article on the Reg hardware comparing them.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   The top game this year for May is UFC 2009, which by all accounts is a little bit lame.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   It's Wii Fit, Infamous again, a bit lame, Pokemon Platinum, come on.
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:48.000]   Whereas last May, the biggest selling game was Grand Theft Auto 4, which had just gotten released.
[00:47:48.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   So if you compare Grand Theft Auto 4 versus Pokemon Platinum, it's not quite the same thing.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   So John, is your daughter saying the games suck these days?
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:00.000]   That's what she said. Yeah. And she should know.
[00:48:00.000 --> 00:48:02.000]   Does she like spend a lot of time on the...
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   I was like, that's all she does.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   All of your kids are big video gamers. She just gave me a dirty look by the way.
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   What grade is she in? She's in the ninth grade.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   Yeah. Straight A's by the way.
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   My son's in the ninth grade, plays a lot of video games, not straight A's though.
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   Maybe he should play more.
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:24.000]   All the big games we mentioned are all sequel games too, aren't they?
[00:48:24.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   Well, that's one thing about video games. Sequel's are usually better than...
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   Unlike movies where the sequels are usually worse, video games are usually better.
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:32.000]   Grand Theft Auto, Halo, Transformers even.
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   Look at the first Grand Theft Auto compared to the most GTA 4.
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   I mean, it's like night and day. The first one was like top down.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   2D, I remember playing it. Like a Pentium 90 or something.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   It was fun, but it wasn't anything like today's games.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:48.000]   No. I think it's mostly economic.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   I mean, somebody mentioned that these games are inexpensive and they're not.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   People pay, what, $300, $400, $500 for the hardware.
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   And then a game like Grand Theft Auto 4 is $60.
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   The Sims 3 just came out, which is usually played by younger kids, a lot of times girls.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   I bet, John, your daughter's interested in it.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:17.000]   You can get that for $50 or $70, depending on the version.
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   That's not cheap and in this economy.
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   And the titles that you listed are all less expensive Wii titles.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   That's true. Those are the best sellers, aren't they? Yeah.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   I think it's an economic thing.
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   Country mile.
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   That might be. They're just too expensive. Should they cut prices and sell more?
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   I think so.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   Well, they should, but the trouble is the cost of development of these games,
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   as the systems get more and more complex, is getting higher and higher.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   Let me tell you something. My son needs a job.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   Let me tell you something. Keep those prices up.
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   Grand Theft Auto 4 cost $150 million to do.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   I was at a, I won't say the name of the game or the company,
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   but I was at a big scoring session for a video game.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:02.000]   They rented Skywalker Sound, 70 piece orchestra, four day recording session.
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   This is the music for a video game. It sounded great,
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   but that must have cost a loan, you know, several million dollars.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   For sure. I mean, you've got musicians there all day.
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   This is one of the reasons why a lot of game developers are really interested in the iPhone as a game platform.
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   Casual gaming. They can do things a lot cheaper.
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   The development is a lot cheaper and it's, they can also recycle a lot of games.
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   And potentially you can reach a much larger audience.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   I mean, the amount of people with iPhones now, what are we into, like 10, 20 million?
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   We must be up in that direction.
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   Whereas the sales of most video game consoles are still not quite there yet.
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   I mean, I go back to that Hollywood comparison.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   You know, an individual can still make a documentary, let's say, or even a theatrical, a small theatrical film.
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   But an individual cannot make a game that's going to compete for the Xbox or they can make an iPhone.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:05.000]   Exactly. So this is really, it's really the change of platform that enables the individual developers or the small groups of developers.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   Because the skill sets that you need to produce a competitive game are essentially the same skill sets now as a Hollywood feature film.
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   Well, you look at the biggest selling, I believe the biggest selling video game company on the iPhone is this company, NG MoCo, who nobody had ever heard of before the iPhone came along.
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:25.000]   I'm thinking I should learn iPhone development.
[00:51:25.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   That's really, it's a really interesting space.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   And by the way, Palm Pre development, anybody who's lining up to develop for the Palm Pre? No.
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   I mean, they may know it's easy as JavaScript, but I think the platform is the iPhone. I really do.
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:42.000]   What games does your daughter play, John? I don't think it's Sims 3 somehow.
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:46.000]   She doesn't want to answer. I think it's killing things.
[00:51:46.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   No, she actually plays a lot of Wii games and she plays on the DS a lot.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   The DS is great. In fact, Henry and I are going to China.
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   And she also comes into the living room here and she turns off the HD feed on the big screen and plays on the Xbox 360 and leaves it on standard definition video, never changes it.
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   She just left. She stomped out kids today. I tell you, they don't know.
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   We used to be happy with SD. So while your daughter is playing Nintendo and my daughter, my son is playing Xbox 360, a 14 year old student from New York State has become the youngest person in history to discover Supernova.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   Oh, I missed that. Yeah. Wow.
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   That puts it in perspective. Yeah.
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   And she's even more using a relatively small telescope spied the faint object 70 million light years away from Earth.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   Yes, they dubbed it SN 2008 HA. It's actually a new kind of exploding star, a thousand times more powerful than a regular Nova, but a thousand times weaker than a typical Supernova.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   And I guess she'll be going to Harvard next year. I don't know.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   Snappy. That's good work. Yeah, it's better than game playing games. Get on that telescope. Get that telescope out. Look for a Nova or something. Maybe you can get something named after you.
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   So now what were these other stories we're going to discuss face squatting face.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   I like it. I like it.
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   Face squatting.
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:34.000]   Facebook announced earlier this week that to come midnight Eastern time on Friday, you would be able to apply because you know when you have a Facebook URL it's you know facebook.com slash question mark colon equals number 13748711.
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:42.000]   You could apply to have whatever you want it as be your name. So for instance, I have facebook.com slash Leo Laporte.
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   And there was a you know a presumably a big land grab they said in the first 15 minutes half a million names were assigned.
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:54:02.000]   By the way infrastructure handled kudos to Facebook. I went there in the first three minutes. I got three domain names because I got chief twit for my personal page Leo Laporte for my fan page and twit live for my twit page.
[00:54:02.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   And it flawless nothing no delays nothing I was I saw one of my favorites. What's that index index dot HTML.
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   And they get and they got it. No, actually that one. I just had to want to check on it and it was available.
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:25.000]   I think now now by now I've said it's gone but index.html. That would be good because dots are ignored. So really would be index HTML. Well the point is the URL looks like it looks like a URL.
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   Or you could put a little my SQL command in there somebody dropped tables. It'd be good. Somebody looked like you know missing page.JSP or something like that.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:47.000]   I think most people however opted for their own name. So here's the question is this kind of from Facebook's point of view. I think they're looking over at Twitter saying gosh you know this could be the phone book for the internet generation.
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   We got to get into this game. Is it. Yeah but so who everybody's got a phone book. Now every now there's phone books everywhere. I mean everybody who has a large base of customers has a name space.
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   Well no one has a larger base than Facebook. I mean you know AOL had this 10 years ago. Yeah. Everybody was their value at AOL that your you know Leo Laporte at AOL dot com was that.
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   I think it was tied to it was tied to the fact that in their case it was critical because if you gave up your AOL address you lost your email. Somebody took Facebook dot com slash default. Now that's a name.
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:38.000]   But it's so there is there value or is it so fragmented that there is not value. Is it possible that somebody like Facebook could become kind of the de facto. In other words somebody said instead of saying at Leo Laporte you'll say slash Leo Laporte.
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:46.000]   Well I think I think it's definitely possible. I mean isn't it. I think for a lot of people particularly you know that younger generation you know Facebook is their directory.
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:58.000]   Everyone has their phone number listed on Facebook. Nobody bothers using email. You just Facebook them. You know what you do on the palm tree. You enter your Facebook ID in here and it takes all the phone numbers from all your Facebook friends and populates your contact.
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:07.000]   I have an app for the iPhone that does the same thing to your address book. And that's exactly what you want because that means you know they can update their Facebook page. You can automatically have their latest numbers.
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:20.000]   I think I think it's certainly going you know I can see in a in six months to a year you know Facebook is your address book. And I mean I think there's got to be some kind of Twitter Facebook.
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:30.000]   I was gonna say why I mean there has to be again once you have a few million users you know you have a certain amount of cloud with that. I mean how many people do you know on Facebook who aren't also on Twitter.
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   I know a lot of people on Facebook that aren't on Twitter. But that's because I think Facebook now has expanded. We know there's a lot much much much larger group of people. Facebook is universal almost. I mean my mother is on Facebook.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:51.000]   And you know my mother would not dream of being on Twitter but everybody she knows is on Facebook all her old friends and so that you know she's got to be on Facebook as well.
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:57:04.000]   Lord help me. Facebook is the new AOL. Yeah. And that's why Facebook is probably look at it's gonna end up like AOL. Yeah I think John it's the right. I think I think Facebook's days are numbered. Really. Yes.
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:14.000]   Yes. Facebook made money last quarter because it's a walled garden. I don't like their attitude.
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:26.000]   I just don't like I don't like that's not only not only know but I think a universal address book but there are you know Facebook Connect is the most genius thing I've heard. Yeah that was because they're allowing you to use that address books to plug in everywhere else.
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:35.000]   I was giving a talk the other day and I was saying you know there is no reason if you're building a web app today to ever build your own sign on system.
[00:57:35.000 --> 00:57:43.000]   You should know there is no reason because everybody can just sign on with Facebook. Except aren't you kind of a prisoner of Facebook then I mean doesn't that.
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:58:03.000]   But what you lose what you lose in terms of like the flexibility and you know somebody else owning that user data you gain in the fact that there's no barrier to entry for whatever your service. Well it's true on my friends as I use discuss on my blog comments and discuss automatically allows Facebook login and I get many more comments because they don't have to create an account. They already have one.
[00:58:03.000 --> 00:58:15.000]   Although now they've added Twitter and also people can sign in Twitter's got a lot. So now that all office that is the engine behind this is that the open open source you know authentication system.
[00:58:15.000 --> 00:58:28.000]   Twitter supports a lot Facebook supports a lot. It's open ID basically they become different. It's different open ID and a lot of you know while they're different. Related conceptually the same. Yeah but not related technically.
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:39.000]   Okay the nice thing about all of Flickr used off is that you can give somebody access to your account without giving them the keys to the kingdom and that was the problem with Twitter you have to give them used to have to give them your password.
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:52.000]   Now you can just say authorize. I'm not I'm not sure somebody in the chat room will tell us I'm not sure that Facebook is off off is more for APIs. Yeah Facebook's using open ID they may not open I and I'm not but is it really.
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:59:03.000]   Yeah that was the big deal that they support they they are now an open ID as a user as a user doesn't look like it but that that no that's kind of that Facebook Connect I guess could also be using an open ID.
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:07.000]   I should try we use open ID for our sites I should try it.
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:36.000]   Go ahead there's a story at Silicon Alley insider Nicholas Carlson has it that in which it's an interview with Zuckerberg and he says that Facebook's future is not as a website but rather it has a platform spread across the web and if if they do that and do that successfully I think Facebook has a future but if they stay kind of as a walled garden that is as much irritating as it is useful which is I think kind of the way a lot of people think.
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:40.000]   Which is I think kind of the way a lot of people feel about it now I don't think they have much of a.
[00:59:40.000 --> 00:59:41.000]   And here's the key.
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:42.000]   And I really don't like them.
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:46.000]   Here's the key you can't be a platform unless you're open in my opinion.
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:50.000]   So I think Microsoft would disagree.
[00:59:50.000 --> 01:00:03.000]   But I agree with you they disagree I think that that's why they're going to lose in the long run because they are closed platform you know look at Google Wave versus whatever you know SharePoint or whatever Microsoft's going to do in the collaboration field who are you going to adopt you're going to adopt the open one.
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:05.000]   Open is possibly game change huge.
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000]   Yeah.
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:09.000]   So I would say the same I would submit the same thing about Facebook if they are.
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:13.000]   And this is the problem I actually had this conversation with Facebook with Dave Warren.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:21.000]   If the problem is that the culture at Facebook they even said this our users don't want us to be open they come there with an expectation of privacy.
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:24.000]   It's very difficult Facebook in effect has to change its culture.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:31.000]   You go to Facebook because no one can see what you're doing there I asked my daughter.
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:33.000]   At nine o'clock on Friday.
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:38.000]   Aren't you going to create Facebook dot com slash Abby Laporte she said no the colleges will see me.
[01:00:38.000 --> 01:00:49.000]   She doesn't the point of Facebook for her is privacy but I think I think there's a difference between being open with data and being open as a platform to allow people to do what they want with their data.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:51.000]   I think it is perfectly except I agree.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:01:05.000]   Facebook to be very very open about its platform but still but you know use that openness to enable people to choose that was my point I said look you've already got this everybody switch on your privacy controls shouldn't if somebody says chosen it's not the default somebody's chosen.
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.000]   Everybody can see my data shouldn't you make it open and Facebook did not.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:12.000]   In fact they said sites like friend you can only cash it for 24 hours they have to dump it.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:25.000]   That isn't open and they say the reason we didn't make it fully open is because our users expect privacy even though I agree with you will you could make that a switch you could say you could have a public facing Facebook but they say we're not public facing Twitter.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:39.000]   Leo what why doesn't your daughter have use that name of hers anyway and just keep what kind of a facade site so that the colleges do see her they're going to see her some prim and proper person who's very happy.
[01:01:39.000 --> 01:01:53.000]   There's a lot of photos of really really really proper things and lots of teenage well don't you think I as a dad wondered well what the hell is on your page that you don't want anybody really no kidding.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.000]   What is it the drunken photos not for public consumption happy what exactly is on there.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:02:00.000]   How many Facebook users are there compared to Gmail users.
[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:07.000]   Gmail is pretty small Facebook much much much much bigger Gmail is surprisingly small Yahoo and hotmail much bigger than Gmail.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:12.000]   There's a huge line share among the tech nerada.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:25.000]   Is there anybody who's I mean it's a numbers game is there anybody who's close to Facebook to have that kind of know and Facebook's growing at a faster rate than anybody Facebook is growing even Twitter is Facebook's growing by like three Twitter's a month I mean
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:28.000]   Facebook is growing I don't know what the actual number is but it's huge.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:35.000]   Well that's the number I heard was 40 million but it must be a lot bigger than Facebook no no it's well over 200 I think it's over 200 million.
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:45.000]   That's how much use a 300 somebody in which 300 now I think now and these by the way as far as I know are active users this isn't even people who signed up for a Facebook account and haven't used it again.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:56.000]   This is this is per month 300 million people I mean it's that's that's that's huge power and is one of the reasons I think we should we should really be pushing Facebook to be open.
[01:02:56.000 --> 01:03:01.000]   So I like your threat Doug you're going to be a well if you don't open up.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:06.000]   I told him I told him you're going to be classmates.com if you don't open up that that was a threat.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:16.000]   I mean there's a big difference between I think we'll had it right it's a big difference between an open platform and you know everything being public that those are not all the same thing.
[01:03:16.000 --> 01:03:24.000]   Right but I agree with you and I said that to them and they said well I know but we still think are you know they.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:37.000]   I think there's an interesting observation so I made he said most of the Facebook is I know are over 40 and Leo your big user my daughter doesn't have a Facebook page and I don't know if my son most of the people you know are over 40.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:42.000]   They say the same thing about Twitter they say oh Twitter is really not where it is for the older demo.
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:48.000]   Isn't it odd that social networking is actually taken over in a with the older people better than younger people.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:50.000]   Why is that where are we more social.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:59.000]   I don't know my daughter who came back into the room finally she says we don't like to be surrounded by old farts.
[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:00.000]   So where are they going.
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:02.000]   Are they yeah right who does are they going.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:04.000]   I don't think.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:08.000]   Are they going to my space where they go and where do they what are they where the kids dying.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:14.000]   Yeah but in fact that's one of the stories my space supposedly big big layoffs on the way.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:40.000]   I don't think I don't think Facebook is full of old people I think older people are now joining Facebook faster but you got to remember what Facebook's roots were it was as a college away from people in college to find each other at universities and that's also where the privacy comes from is is is from its roots and the design of it originally and I think that's kind of built into it and it's hard for them to get away from it.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:44.000]   But yeah I don't think Facebook is mostly old people I think that's who's getting on now.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.000]   Yeah I agree.
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.000]   I agree.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:50.000]   One of you guys there said to something like your mom or your grandmother.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:52.000]   Yeah my mom.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:53.000]   But your mom's like my age.
[01:04:53.000 --> 01:04:55.000]   Doesn't that say.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000]   Your mom's not.
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:59.000]   Your mom's probably younger.
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:00.000]   Your mom's probably much younger.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:06.000]   I mean what would it take for something new to come along that was creative and interesting and that attracted younger people.
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.000]   They're using Facebook.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:12.000]   Listen we've gone from AOL to Live Journal to MySpace to Facebook.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000]   What is that the end we're going to stop at Facebook.
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000]   I don't see why.
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:16.000]   Clearly not.
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:17.000]   I agree with John.
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:18.000]   I think it's you know.
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000]   And I think also Twitter has some legs there.
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:34.000]   I mean my you know I don't know a lot of kids my daughter's age but but she's gotten on Facebook and she I mean on Twitter and you know has found it useful and is beginning to kind of evangelize it to her friends.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:38.000]   She's the job she asked me to mention her Facebook name so she's the job.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:42.000]   T H E J U B so you go follower treat her nice.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:48.000]   And just got more and more people more and more people who are younger I think are getting on Twitter.
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:55.000]   And I think the kind of the rap that it's for old people doing social networking is probably going to end soon.
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:06:08.000]   I think what you're seeing is is the universality of these platforms that as people start to realize you know it all it doesn't happen to your friends are using it but it sweeps through groups virally.
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:23.000]   So I remember in Facebook with the fastest growing town was Toronto and it Toronto was growing faster than like the whole United States because everybody was you know there was this viral spread and I think that's how it kind of goes and because social networks are only useful if you have a network of people on them.
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:29.000]   Right. And so they are inherently sweep through groups of people because one person tells the other person tells the other.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:33.000]   Although Twitter is not quite that way because Twitter you can follow people you don't know.
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:37.000]   It's not really a social network Twitter is kind of like a fan club.
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:42.000]   So here's here's here's your daughter's site the job everybody go see the job.
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000]   My daughter is also on Twitter by the way.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:54.000]   In fact she started she started using it more but you know to actually give the lie to your daughter John my daughter when she went to France as junior in high school.
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:07:02.000]   Everybody that was going she was going to be going to school with was on Facebook they connected that way they got to know each other that way they stay in touch now that way.
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:04.000]   Everybody in her high school is on Facebook.
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:10.000]   I think that that's the it's it's not for old farts it's for everybody now I think everybody's using it.
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:15.000]   That's I mean that's how you get to 300 million active users. It's stunning.
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:21.000]   And this endorsement has been brought to you by the internet.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:24.000]   How many of you guys got your you know vanity URL.
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000]   I just got mine like two seconds ago.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000]   I literally just sat here and typed it in.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000]   It's a good thing if you didn't do it. So you got Will Harris.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.000]   Will Harris.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:32.000]   Not Channel Flip.
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:36.000]   So I got Twitter.com/willharris Facebook.com/willharris.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:38.000]   I think I already had Channel Flip for them from the fan page.
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:43.000]   Yeah I think they did something weird with fan pages because I had Leo Laporte before this all happened.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:46.000]   I'm hoping somebody else takes mine so I can sue them later.
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000]   Thank you Tony LaRusso.
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.000]   Well they.
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:51.000]   Yeah Tony's suing Twitter.
[01:07:51.000 --> 01:07:59.000]   They actually had a mechanism which I took advantage of if you're a trademark holder.
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:03.000]   You could send a note to Facebook saying I have a trademark on Twitter which I did.
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:08.000]   And they will monitor for people using your trademark and block it.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.000]   Wow.
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:16.000]   But now they sent me a note back saying we've kind of swamped right now so it might be a little while before we do that.
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:19.000]   I think it's quite interesting.
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:25.000]   Denise Howell has a blog post on her ZDNet legal blog Logarithms.
[01:08:25.000 --> 01:08:27.000]   I always confuse it with blogarithms by the way.
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.000]   Which is my blog.
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000]   Which is your blog Doug.
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:34.000]   Six things to know if your Facebook username has been squatted.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:37.000]   See once you pick a name you can't change it.
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.000]   You know you're kind of stuck with it.
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.000]   Can't get more than one.
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:40.000]   Can't get more than one.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:41.000]   It's kind of bad.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:48.000]   I mean I chose Chief Twit for my personal page but you know it's like getting a tattoo.
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:52.000]   What if you know in a few years I want to be a dignified fellow and now I'm stuck.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:57.000]   I'm sure if you call Mr. Zuckerberg I'm sure he'll take my calls.
[01:08:57.000 --> 01:09:00.000]   Mr. Zuckerberg Chief Twit Online for.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:07.000]   Here's some things to keep in mind about username squatting.
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:13.000]   There is a form the IP infringement form that you can say hey I don't you know.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:15.000]   So this is on Denise's blog.
[01:09:15.000 --> 01:09:16.000]   Six things to know.
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:17.000]   Logarithms.
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:22.000]   It's blogs.znet.com/howell.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:27.000]   Many jurisdictions including California where Facebook is headquartered restrict or prohibit.
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:28.000]   I didn't know this.
[01:09:28.000 --> 01:09:32.000]   Unauthorized use of a person's name image likeness or unequivocal aspects of one's identity.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:38.000]   So if somebody's posing as Doug K on Facebook and pretending to be you not that their name is Doug K.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000]   You can't do anything about that.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000]   But if they're pretending to be the Doug K.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:43.000]   You can pursue them.
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:47.000]   She said it's not squatting if somebody happens to share your name.
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:51.000]   And you know that's kind of the legal thing.
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:53.000]   Did you get Doug or you Doug K.
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:54.000]   Facebook.com/doug.k.
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:55.000]   Doug.k.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.000]   The dots.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.000]   Docs are invisible.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:59.000]   Well you could use it or not.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.000]   Doesn't matter.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.000]   So what was that.
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:03.000]   Now there was one other story you wanted to get to before we finished.
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:06.000]   Yeah the digital convergence.
[01:10:06.000 --> 01:10:08.000]   So we have three minutes left.
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:09.000]   We have three minutes left.
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.000]   There's not much to say.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000]   I don't think you know it's funny.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:14.000]   You're talking about the digital convergence.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:16.000]   No the digital analog to digital.
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:30.000]   Look at actually a moment of silence for analog television which died after a long and healthy life on Friday, June 12th, 2009.
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.000]   I guess it wasn't a big catastrophe they expected.
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:35.000]   They probably could have done this a year ago.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000]   I don't know.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:38.000]   I mean they got 300,000 calls on Saturday.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:40.000]   As I said most of those calls were.
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:42.000]   It's not working.
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:43.000]   Is that the FCC got the call.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:44.000]   FCC.
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.000]   Who's going to know to call the FCC.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000]   I think most people call the TV stations.
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:50.000]   If they knew to call the FCC they would have known about the converter boxes.
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:51.000]   That's a good point.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.000]   That's a good point.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:53.000]   We should probably.
[01:10:53.000 --> 01:10:55.000]   When they have TV stations put a message on call the FCC.
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.000]   Don't call us.
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:57.000]   Oh my talk is not working.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:10:59.000]   I can't figure out how to use the.
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:04.000]   You know the thing that's scandalous to me is how all the cable companies have used this as an excuse to befuddle people.
[01:11:04.000 --> 01:11:05.000]   Yo the digital transition.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:08.000]   This is something you probably don't have to deal with yet in London.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:11.000]   Not until I think like we have another couple of years.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000]   Yeah but at some point it's going to happen.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:16.000]   And the cable companies go the digital transitions happening.
[01:11:16.000 --> 01:11:20.000]   You better get a digital box as if that had anything to do with anything.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:23.000]   Yeah but they see you were talking earlier today.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000]   They read digitized Petaluma.
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:26.000]   This is.
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:27.000]   Hello.
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:28.000]   Yeah.
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.000]   So what phone is that.
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:34.000]   Is that the 71.
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.000]   It's an analog clunker.
[01:11:36.000 --> 01:11:38.000]   Oh it's a real phone.
[01:11:38.000 --> 01:11:39.000]   Analog.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.000]   Is it a princess a pink princess phone.
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.000]   I could see.
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:44.000]   If I had those I believe me I would love to collect a few of those.
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:50.000]   You know my wife wants me to buy desperately a phone that hangs on the wall in the kitchen as a really long cord.
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:54.000]   She says we keep losing the dang wireless phones.
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:55.000]   The kids keep taking them.
[01:11:55.000 --> 01:11:57.000]   I'm on a corded phone.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:11:59.000]   You just get a cradle and then.
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:00.000]   Remember that.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:01.000]   Remember that.
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.000]   We have the really really long coiled cord.
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:04.000]   You kind of get it wrapped all around you.
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.000]   It's funny how the more you go forward the more you want to get back.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:08.000]   Yeah please bring back.
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:17.000]   That's that's that's what I have on my desk is a corded phone with a long cord because in a hurricane when the power goes out you want a corded phone.
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:19.000]   And so you want to be able to make sure I have one.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.000]   You want to be able to carry it all the way into the into the bathroom.
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.000]   The seller.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:27.000]   So Comcast John do you have Comcast.
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:29.000]   Yeah I think it's Comcast stick.
[01:12:29.000 --> 01:12:30.000]   Yeah.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:45.000]   So so the have you seen the spots that they're running telling you that if you have Comcast whether you have a converter box or not you don't need to change anything.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:54.000]   You know I we actually if you watch the last cranky geeks we did I think it was either the one that's run on maybe someone running that on Wednesday or the one last week.
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:13:00.000]   We somebody brought in the card that they're sending out to all their customers to which has all this vague information.
[01:13:00.000 --> 01:13:02.000]   Oh we're going to lose this channel and that channel.
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:04.000]   You better get a hold of us.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:13.000]   So it's very confusing but I actually only I have Comcast but I really only used it for a for a sling box and for my Internet connection.
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:17.000]   Their goal they really want to go all I remember this when we were at tech TV.
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:22.000]   They want to be all digital because they can get more channels jammed in there and they have and they can't.
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:25.000]   FCC won't let them force customers to do this.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:28.000]   I think there's a few more years before they could say willy nilly.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.000]   You got to get a digital box.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.000]   Customers don't want a cable box.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:32.000]   I don't want a cable box.
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.000]   Who wants a cable box.
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:35.000]   So they're tricky.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:36.000]   They're trying to trick you.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:39.000]   Well but now they've made a technological change that requires it.
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000]   They have disabled the analog channels.
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:42.000]   They don't tell you that.
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:44.000]   They tell you if you're on Comcast you're covered.
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:48.000]   So you know they're doing it you know sort of area by area.
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:54.000]   We lost our analog channels about 45 days ago and you have to get a DTA.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:55.000]   It's called you have to get a box.
[01:13:55.000 --> 01:13:57.000]   It's nearly disabled analog.
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:13:58.000]   It's gone.
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:13:59.000]   I thought they couldn't do that.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.000]   We know that's that's the scam.
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000]   That's why I'm jumping up and down.
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:13.000]   I think what's really interesting is that you know I think these companies really do realize the amount of cool and clever and money saving and money making stuff that you can do when you get people into digital.
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:32.000]   I read an amazing article yesterday about how I guess the equivalent in the UK Sky TV which runs digital satellite about how they're now doing user profiling based on what you watch and they'll stream you your own you like bespoke ads to insert into your TV service.
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:40.000]   And so they'll pick up what it is you like to watch and they'll stream you the ads digitally that they think is going to be most relevant to you in your TV break.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:48.000]   So you might be watching Lost on TV the person in the next door gets you know like a Chrysler ad but you're really interested in technology you get a Microsoft ad.
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.000]   But what's wrong with that?
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:50.000]   They store it on the hard drive.
[01:14:50.000 --> 01:14:53.000]   Isn't that a good thing because then I'll see ads that I care about and not as I don't.
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:55.000]   Well you can argue about whether it's good or bad but you can't do that with analog.
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:14:56.000]   Right.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:57.000]   So another reason for them to go digital.
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:14:59.000]   So it's just another reason for them to push digital.
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:05.000]   I mean about a year ago they stopped sending the channel guide down channel 11 where I live.
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:06.000]   It just stopped.
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:08.000]   Channel 11 went empty.
[01:15:08.000 --> 01:15:12.000]   They didn't put another channel on it and now you have to get the digital to get to get that back.
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000]   You want a channel guide.
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000]   I hate the channel guide but you know.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:20.000]   You know what the most watched cable channel is.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:23.000]   Always has been the TV guide channel.
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:24.000]   Pathetic.
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:27.000]   It's the most watched cable channel.
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:29.000]   Because it's so fascinating.
[01:15:29.000 --> 01:15:31.000]   People just leave it on.
[01:15:31.000 --> 01:15:34.000]   I think that I think it must be to default in some way and it's just it's what's on.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:42.000]   Well another way that the cable companies are trying to kind of push this onto people is with DVRs.
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:47.000]   You know if you have a DVR you don't need that either and that actually makes a separate box.
[01:15:47.000 --> 01:15:48.000]   Right.
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:49.000]   Something at least is valuable.
[01:15:49.000 --> 01:15:51.000]   It has some value to it.
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:54.000]   I switched to U-verse a while back.
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:16:00.000]   They have that in our area and you know it's basically works the same as cable comes in over the phone lines.
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:03.000]   You know great DSL service if you choose that.
[01:16:03.000 --> 01:16:11.000]   And so people where you know they have Verizon's Fios or where they have U-verse you know you're starting to get some choice.
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:14.000]   But it's not everywhere yet.
[01:16:14.000 --> 01:16:17.000]   Well I lost my FM too.
[01:16:17.000 --> 01:16:18.000]   That was a nasty problem.
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000]   Yeah we used to be able to get radio on the cable.
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:23.000]   So now you can't DTA won't give you any audio outputs.
[01:16:23.000 --> 01:16:26.000]   Now you're supposed to subscribe to the music channels.
[01:16:26.000 --> 01:16:28.000]   You're one of those old people.
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:30.000]   You should call the FCC.
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000]   I just lost my radio.
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000]   I happen to know the phone number of the FCC.
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:42.000]   I got a call on the I got a call on the radio show this week from somebody who has remember those old radios that you could get TV stations on.
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:44.000]   She says what happens.
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.000]   You don't have those in the UK.
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000]   What the heck is that.
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:51.000]   In the US you could buy a radio that tunes the television dial.
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:51.000]   Right.
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:54.000]   And listen to the radio the TV on the radio which is great.
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:56.000]   You know what 90 percent of the time it's plenty.
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:56.000]   Yeah.
[01:16:56.000 --> 01:16:57.000]   It's all I want.
[01:16:57.000 --> 01:16:58.000]   That would be awesome.
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:16:59.000]   Yeah.
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:00.000]   She said what's going to happen.
[01:17:00.000 --> 01:17:02.000]   I said it doesn't work anymore.
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:05.000]   Do you know the iPhone app public radio tuner.
[01:17:05.000 --> 01:17:08.000]   No I don't know that public radio tuner dot org.
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:09.000]   OK.
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:12.000]   Just before we go public radio turn it over to some freebie for you all.
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:13.000]   It's a nonprofit app.
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:14.000]   It's a great app.
[01:17:14.000 --> 01:17:26.000]   It's a version one is available now and this gives you access no matter where you are to almost almost all the me all the major public radio stations in the country.
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:35.000]   You know I use Wonder Radio W.U.N.D.R. from Weather Underground and it has the most complete list of everything including all the public radio stations.
[01:17:35.000 --> 01:17:36.000]   So you don't have to be limited to that.
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:39.000]   Does it give you the stations or just the listings.
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:41.000]   No you can listen on your on your iPhone.
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000]   In fact most of them work on on edge.
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:46.000]   Wonder this works on edge.
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:46.000]   Yeah.
[01:17:46.000 --> 01:17:47.000]   Wonder radio.
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:49.000]   I would say also another good choice.
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000]   But I'll give you I'll give you a plug for this.
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:52.000]   Thank you.
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:18:00.000]   And and what they're working on coming soon will be all of the public radio programs on demand.
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.000]   This is nice though.
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:01.000]   Yeah.
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:01.000]   Yeah.
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:02.000]   Many of them do that.
[01:18:02.000 --> 01:18:03.000]   KQED does it on demand.
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:03.000]   Right.
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:07.000]   But on the phone it's a it's a I think people should be listening to podcasts.
[01:18:07.000 --> 01:18:08.000]   Yeah.
[01:18:08.000 --> 01:18:09.000]   Forget this radio.
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:10.000]   What's radio.
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:14.000]   Actually the BBC to their credit has most of their shows on demand as well.
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:15.000]   It does.
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:15.000]   They did.
[01:18:15.000 --> 01:18:17.000]   Well they they made a new thing.
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:18.000]   You can listen on the audio.
[01:18:18.000 --> 01:18:25.000]   So you can also you can get they make a lot of podcasts through the iTunes store or RSS which you can get just downloaded.
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:32.000]   But of course they've also got the iPlayer which is their kind of I guess Hulu equivalent which you can which you can watch on the iPhone.
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:41.000]   What's more exciting is that unless you're outside the UK unless you're outside the UK in which case you need to proxy your proxy your connection and you can you can wangle it.
[01:18:41.000 --> 01:18:54.000]   But what they're working on now which is fantastic is a is an open standard for set top box on demand over IP.
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:19:05.000]   So in five years time you know theoretically every TV will be built to a standard that includes IP streaming straight from the Internet.
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:07.000]   So you can go BBC one BBC two BBC three.
[01:19:07.000 --> 01:19:08.000]   That's great.
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:09.000]   That's awesome.
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:16.000]   And you can create your own channel guide and it can include will the TVs have to be updated to do that or there'll be new TVs.
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:20.000]   There's actually a couple of Sony sets out there now that do that.
[01:19:20.000 --> 01:19:21.000]   Yeah the IPTV sets.
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:23.000]   But that's a Sony that's the future.
[01:19:23.000 --> 01:19:25.000]   BBC is creating an open standard.
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:26.000]   Fantastic.
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.000]   Anybody can contribute.
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:28.000]   What's the name of the standard?
[01:19:28.000 --> 01:19:31.000]   Well the code name of it is called the Canvas project.
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:43.000]   And so the idea is that it'll just pipe any IP channel to your TV like any other channel of TV and when that comes huge that is the whole over all over all video all on demand.
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:54.000]   Yeah it's that means DVRs go away completely because everything's a challenge and we have because we do streaming video and we need to offer it downloadable so that we don't you don't have because you can't TVO streaming video.
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:54.000]   Yes.
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:55.000]   So we need to solve that.
[01:19:55.000 --> 01:20:02.000]   I think it's a small fraction of people will watch the downloads but nevertheless you got off.
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:04.000]   And the ability then for Indies for Indie producers to be a long side.
[01:20:04.000 --> 01:20:06.000]   Well you do channel flip this you must be thrilled.
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:08.000]   Yeah I'm quite excited.
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:09.000]   Yeah.
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:10.000]   Well that's great.
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000]   Two words bandwidth caps.
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:15.000]   Yeah in the US we've got to fight that.
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:16.000]   Video bandwidth cap.
[01:20:16.000 --> 01:20:17.000]   We've got to fight that baby.
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000]   Yeah good luck is right.
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:30.000]   Ladies and gentlemen I'm going to buy this PRX public. In fact not only that I'll tell you what I'm going to do Doug I'm going to plug it I'm giving it on the next Mac mania in about a month I'm giving a lecture on 60 great iPhone apps.
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:31.000]   This will be one of them.
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:32.000]   Hopefully version 2.
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:33.000]   It's a great app.
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.000]   Version 2 looks really cool.
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000]   Did you know about it already Dwight?
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:37.000]   It's really cool.
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:39.000]   Yes in fact I think version 2 is out I think I have it.
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:40.000]   It's in beta.
[01:20:40.000 --> 01:20:41.000]   On my iPhone.
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.000]   Oh okay.
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:51.000]   Version 2 is what's on the store. It works really well and the new one our the Wednesday night technology bites radio show I do wasn't on the first one and it is on the new one.
[01:20:51.000 --> 01:20:54.000]   So I was really happy about that.
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:57.000]   We are on a Pacifica station and not all of those are carried on apps like this.
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:58.000]   That's great.
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:20:59.000]   That's really great.
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:02.000]   Well I am we're out of time but what a great show this has been.
[01:21:02.000 --> 01:21:07.000]   I want to thank you so much for coming all the way from London England I mean Oxford England ladies and gentlemen.
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:08.000]   Will Harris.
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:09.000]   Well we flew out of London.
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000]   You flew out of London so that counts.
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:18.000]   So can I get a Twitter dot com slash Will Harris plug my numbers are miniscule compared to the mighty Laporte.
[01:21:18.000 --> 01:21:19.000]   Can I get a tweet tweet.
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:24.000]   Did you see the New York Times did a I think fairly scathing article on the suggested users list on Twitter.
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:31.000]   I was very happy to see them out that not scathing but they revealed the truth about it which is it has nothing to do with anything.
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:34.000]   So it's Twitter dot com slash Will Harris.
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:37.000]   One L Will Harris.
[01:21:37.000 --> 01:21:39.000]   Someone get me over 14,000.
[01:21:39.000 --> 01:21:40.000]   I'm so close.
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:45.000]   We can do that. You're currently at 13,880 followers and a lovely background.
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.000]   What is that.
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.000]   It's a ninja.
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:48.000]   It's a cute ninja.
[01:21:48.000 --> 01:21:59.000]   It's from one of my favorite web comics which is Little Gamers Little dash Gamers dot com massively under read web comic with some fantastic illustrations.
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:01.000]   It's from Sweden.
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:03.000]   So it's very you know pro pirate bay.
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:10.000]   That's awesome. As is Sweden apparently as 7 percent of the vote for their EU representative going to the pie.
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:11.000]   She's fantastic.
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:12.000]   I mean how exciting.
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:14.000]   That's bizarre.
[01:22:14.000 --> 01:22:16.000]   I also want to thank you for coming out Mr.
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:19.000]   Doug K of the Conversations Network.
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.000]   So good to see you.
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.000]   Proto podcaster.
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:25.000]   You can find me at Twitter Doug K.
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:34.000]   But you can also see our new Web site spoken word dot org which is a project I've been doing for about the last year and it's almost working.
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:35.000]   Tell me about that. What is it.
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:42.000]   What is it. Well rather than try to grow our own podcasting we realize that the new challenge is finding and sharing podcasting.
[01:22:42.000 --> 01:22:52.000]   So it's a site for finding and sharing everything in online spoken word video video and meta site.
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.000]   What's that.
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:59.000]   It's a meta site. Yeah it's a meta site and it's we've got over a quarter million objects in there now.
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:06.000]   We've got audio books public radio shows podcasts you name it.
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:09.000]   Ladies and gentlemen also want to thank our good friend Mr.
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:15.000]   Dwight Silverman for joining us from the Houston Chronicle blogs dot cron dot com slash tech blog.
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:20.000]   He is on Twitter also D Silverman on Twitter and he's guy is so wired.
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:27.000]   He is always on Twitter so he has to put an apology on Twitter when he's not going to be there to do the show.
[01:23:27.000 --> 01:23:33.000]   Well it's just I don't want to I don't want people I want people to like me.
[01:23:33.000 --> 01:23:37.000]   Well five thousand eight hundred and forty four people like you.
[01:23:37.000 --> 01:23:42.000]   And that's thanks to you because every time I'm on here I get you know another thousand followers.
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:44.000]   I'm glad that I like your Twitter.
[01:23:44.000 --> 01:23:46.000]   We have the Twitter suggested users list.
[01:23:46.000 --> 01:23:50.000]   It's much much better than the official you want to do that.
[01:23:50.000 --> 01:23:51.000]   Actually that would be quite cool.
[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:52.000]   You're suggested users.
[01:23:52.000 --> 01:23:53.000]   We can do that.
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:56.000]   If you all you have to do is go to my Twitter account look at who I follow.
[01:23:56.000 --> 01:23:59.000]   That's kind of who I would suggest you follow.
[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:00.000]   Everybody's got a different Twitter.
[01:24:00.000 --> 01:24:03.000]   John of course the real Dvorak John C Dvorak.
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.000]   Thanks for being here today.
[01:24:05.000 --> 01:24:06.000]   Always a pleasure.
[01:24:06.000 --> 01:24:11.000]   Don't forget channel Dvorak dot com which you have there on the on the I do.
[01:24:11.000 --> 01:24:13.000]   It's on the car on the car.
[01:24:13.000 --> 01:24:17.000]   Hi Ron and yeah I'd like to get to fifty five thousand before midnight tonight on my Twitter account.
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:19.000]   I only need two hundred would you please help me out.
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:24.000]   Oh you show off everybody's chilling.
[01:24:24.000 --> 01:24:26.000]   I started it will did.
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:27.000]   What is the what is the picture.
[01:24:27.000 --> 01:24:28.000]   Is that the Swedish flag.
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:29.000]   What is that for you.
[01:24:29.000 --> 01:24:36.000]   That's a semaphore for the letter D which is about as obscure as you can get John.
[01:24:36.000 --> 01:24:44.000]   But curiously somebody pointed out to me that also if you just run it by itself on a boat you know this is a boat flag that's for the letter D.
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:46.000]   People like to signal to each other.
[01:24:46.000 --> 01:24:51.000]   It means when it's running by itself it does that distress a boat out of control.
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:52.000]   Look out.
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:53.000]   Couldn't be more appropriate for your icon.
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:54.000]   I love that.
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:55.000]   Look out.
[01:24:55.000 --> 01:24:57.000]   The real Dvorak out of control.
[01:24:57.000 --> 01:24:58.000]   I'm Leo LeBorgue.
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.000]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:01.000]   We'll see you next time.
[01:25:01.000 --> 01:25:02.000]   Another tweet.
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:03.000]   Oh wait a minute.
[01:25:03.000 --> 01:25:04.000]   I wasn't going to play.
[01:25:04.000 --> 01:25:05.000]   Helen Fice.
[01:25:05.000 --> 01:25:08.000]   By the way there's a bunch of people betting on whether you would or not.
[01:25:08.000 --> 01:25:09.000]   Play Ellen Fice.
[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:16.000]   No there's a bunch of people in the chat room saying I'll bet you 10 bucks he doesn't play it even though he promised he would.
[01:25:16.000 --> 01:25:19.000]   Actually Leo that aired.
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:20.000]   It aired.
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:21.000]   Yes.
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:24.000]   Yeah it did air but only briefly didn't they pull it.
[01:25:24.000 --> 01:25:25.000]   Right.
[01:25:25.000 --> 01:25:26.000]   Right.
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:27.000]   They aired like a few times.
[01:25:27.000 --> 01:25:30.000]   Because otherwise we would otherwise we wouldn't be able we wouldn't have it if it hadn't aired I guess.
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:33.000]   Or maybe they put it I thought they maybe put it on a website.
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:26:03.000]   On the PC and it was like beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep beep
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:05.000]   I'm high as a kite.
[01:26:05.000 --> 01:26:07.000]   She'd gone on set or she'd gone to a company.
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:08.000]   She says it was cough syrup.
[01:26:08.000 --> 01:26:13.000]   Who was auditioning for it and she'd gone to a company somebody else and they were.
[01:26:13.000 --> 01:26:15.000]   She wasn't there to be on the show.
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:18.000]   She wasn't there to be on it and they said and she suddenly had this story and they said this is amazing.
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:28.000]   The only problem was she had she'd been on some kind of drastic pain medication so she was kind of hopped up on the pain medication which they didn't realize and it was only kind of afterwards when they put it out.
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:30.000]   I think Apple is very stone chic.
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:40.000]   I got to play it one more time now that you're now that you say that I think we should end the show with the lovely.
[01:26:40.000 --> 01:26:42.000]   Heidi Fleiss not Heidi Fleiss.
[01:26:42.000 --> 01:26:44.000]   She was that was she was a madam.
[01:26:44.000 --> 01:26:45.000]   She was a madam.
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:48.000]   Ellen Ellen Fice Ellen Fice not Heidi Fleiss.
[01:26:48.000 --> 01:26:49.000]   No.
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:52.000]   Although we could end the show with Heidi Fleiss too but I would possibly get a second one.
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:53.000]   There's another one.
[01:26:53.000 --> 01:26:54.000]   Oh no.
[01:26:54.000 --> 01:26:55.000]   Let's find it.
[01:26:55.000 --> 01:26:56.000]   I'm sure.
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:57.000]   One didn't air.
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.000]   I'm sure that.
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:26:59.000]   Oh yeah.
[01:26:59.000 --> 01:27:00.000]   Ellen Fice strikes back.
[01:27:00.000 --> 01:27:03.000]   I figure if you're going to do it if you're going to do one do two.
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:04.000]   Right.
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:06.000]   I've seen the second one.
[01:27:06.000 --> 01:27:12.000]   Take it someplace fun skiing or something you know the beach by the pool.
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:20.000]   It's really fast and I just got it and it's silver and it's really exciting and the sound quality is really good and I don't have to watch airplane movies anymore.
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:26.000]   You got your feet in the sand and you're typing away and it's it's fun.
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:32.000]   I was thinking about how my friends were doing their homework at home and I was like wow this is really great.
[01:27:32.000 --> 01:27:37.000]   Yeah I love my G4.
[01:27:37.000 --> 01:27:38.000]   Oh my god.
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:39.000]   Marvelous.
[01:27:39.000 --> 01:27:40.000]   I never saw that one.
[01:27:40.000 --> 01:27:41.000]   That's interesting.
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:42.000]   Have you ever seen this one.
[01:27:42.000 --> 01:27:45.000]   This is your iPod iPods here.
[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:51.000]   I sell iPods at Dodger games too and then you got to pass them down kind of the way they sell hot dogs.
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:54.000]   I've got about fifteen hundred in the trunk of my car.
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:57.000]   I'm usually shirtless just for effect.
[01:27:57.000 --> 01:27:59.000]   The money just starts flowing in.
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:00.000]   You can listen to all these songs.
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:02.000]   I say at least over 50 songs.
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:05.000]   I'm not quite sure the amount.
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:08.000]   I think it's like two million songs.
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:12.000]   My name is Will Ferrell and I'm a porn actor.
[01:28:12.000 --> 01:28:15.000]   We'll see you next time another twit is in the can.
[01:28:15.000 --> 01:28:19.000]   I'm a tech nerd but a tech nerd mama say.
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000]   Leo LeBrun and I'm Kevin Ross.
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:25.000]   Don't tell me to a tech nerd but a tech nerd mama say.
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:27.000]   And don't you worry are you in the madhouse.
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:30.000]   I'm gonna get the props on but my tech nerds on the end.
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:33.000]   I used to be so cool but now I'm just a laughing you up.
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:36.000]   I'm a tech nerd but a tech nerd mama say.
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:41.000]   I used to drop the reggae styles but then in '06 I done dropped the twit broadcast on my iTunes list.
[01:28:41.000 --> 01:28:44.000]   I used to jump like a pimp in shiz that was it.
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:47.000]   I used to slick my hair back man and the cool got shit.
[01:28:47.000 --> 01:28:50.000]   Rockin' MTV live, cribs on a gangsta tip.
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:53.000]   But I done clicked subscribe on twit man that was it.
[01:28:53.000 --> 01:28:56.000]   But first I started with LaPorte and I jumped like Kevin Ross.
[01:28:56.000 --> 01:28:58.000]   Another dig nation short gospel life.
[01:28:58.000 --> 01:29:01.000]   Then old smart Alex Albright done moved in with his girl.
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:03.000]   And you know that lends hope to a sap like me.
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:05.000]   Maybe I can do this say.
[01:29:05.000 --> 01:29:08.000]   Half man, a half nerd but I have to.
[01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000]   I listen to them tech nerds say.
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:12.000]   Leo LeBrun and I'm Kevin Ross.
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:16.000]   Don't tell me to a tech nerd but a tech nerd mama say.
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:18.000]   Leo LeBrun and I'm Kevin Ross.
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:22.000]   Don't tell me to a tech nerd but a tech nerd mama say.
[01:29:22.000 --> 01:29:24.000]   And don't you worry are you in the net?

[01:29:33.000 --> 01:29:35.000]   I once was cool rebel against the Uncle Sam.
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:38.000]   But now they sensitize it so conform to the Merlin Man.
[01:29:38.000 --> 01:29:41.000]   Bring the ring complain rent until the cat conforms.
[01:29:41.000 --> 01:29:44.000]   The 4X Scott has fallen out of two we've grown to love.
[01:29:44.000 --> 01:29:47.000]   But the scene is buzzed out loud updates here every day.
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:50.000]   Tom Merritt and Miss Molly with them almost max she hits.

[01:29:58.000 --> 01:30:01.000]   I rock the twit podcast my photos looking great.
[01:30:01.000 --> 01:30:04.000]   See I'm half man, a half nerd but I have to.
