[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:23.040]   hungover or you've been watching football. The show where we talk about the tech news of the week
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:29.440]   with the best tech journalists I can round up at a short notice. Actually, we got a great panel
[00:02:29.440 --> 00:02:32.960]   for you. I want to welcome a start off with Daniel Robino. We'll start on the all the way on the
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.840]   right. Daniel is the executive editor of Windows Central. It's been an age since you've been on.
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:43.040]   So I'm thrilled to have you on again. Thank you for being here. Where are you located?
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:48.400]   I'm in Worcester, Massachusetts. What's the spelled wrong? But okay,
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:56.480]   spelled Worcestershirester. Worcestershire. And you were at the surface event. I take it.
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:03.120]   Awesome. So we'll definitely talk about that. And kind of a shocker from Microsoft on 1809,
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:09.200]   but that's that's to come. Also joining us from the fabulous tech republic, Ant-Pruitt.
[00:03:09.200 --> 00:03:16.560]   That's great to have you, Ant. And his Clem's in shirt. He's got his orange. That's a tiger,
[00:03:16.560 --> 00:03:23.920]   right? Tiger paw. The tiger paw, baby. Tiger's for life. Yeah. And welcoming for the first time
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:28.960]   to twit, but I'm thrilled to have him. Not the first time in our studio, Rich D'Amuro from KTLA.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:33.440]   Hey, Rich. Thanks for having me on, Leo. It's a pleasure to be here today.
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:38.160]   It's been a huge oversight not having you on before, Rich is my designated
[00:03:38.160 --> 00:03:46.400]   fill-in. I likened you to Lou Gehrig today on the radio show. Oh, thank you. I told the story of
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:51.840]   Wally Pip, the first baseman for the New York Yankees who got a bad headache and
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:55.600]   couldn't play that day. And he went to the manager and said, "Can I take the day off?"
[00:03:55.600 --> 00:04:00.160]   Manager said, "Yeah, I got this kid Lou Gehrig." He could fill in for you.
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:06.480]   Gehrig never left first base for some of the thousand games, 3,000 games, something like that.
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.720]   And no one remembers Wally Pip, except me. And I don't want to be the next Wally Pip,
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:14.800]   but you're definitely a Lou Gehrig. So I appreciate you filling in, Rich. It's nice to have you.
[00:04:14.800 --> 00:04:19.280]   Well, thank you. I appreciate it. Thanks for having me. Oh, my pleasure. And I'm glad you're
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:24.400]   all here because there's a great conundrum facing us in the tech journalism community today.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:30.720]   And it started on Thursday with Bloomberg Business Week. And some amazing reportage,
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:41.200]   I'm sorry, 17 anonymous sources in government, three-letter agencies, Amazon and Apple,
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:51.600]   said that Chinese spies had placed a tiny, rice-sized microchip on Super Micro Motherboards in 2015.
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.120]   These Super Micro Motherboards were used in many, many places, servers by Apple,
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:03.280]   the Department of Defense. We even had one because this all came to light. According to,
[00:05:03.280 --> 00:05:06.320]   now I'm going to say this a couple of times in this story because I want to emphasize,
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:12.160]   according to Bloomberg Business Week, we even had one because it was first discovered by Amazon
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.600]   when they were doing their due diligence. They were about to acquire a company called
[00:05:15.600 --> 00:05:20.800]   Elemental Technologies. Elemental makes a streaming box, a box we've used for some years,
[00:05:20.800 --> 00:05:26.560]   a very expensive box that takes our video, compresses it, and then feeds it out to
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:31.040]   Ustream, YouTube, Twitch, Mixer, whoever it is that's re-streaming our stuff.
[00:05:31.040 --> 00:05:37.440]   These Elemental Motherboards, Amazon during a routine security audit before the acquisition
[00:05:37.440 --> 00:05:47.360]   found this little chip according to Bloomberg Business Week, the chip was posing as a
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.280]   support, a minor support chip on the motherboard. Nobody would pay any attention to it,
[00:05:51.280 --> 00:05:56.240]   but when the mother was first booted in a server would modify the operating system,
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:06:02.880]   phone home the Chinese military, and help the Chinese military hack these server servers in the
[00:06:02.880 --> 00:06:09.920]   Pentagon. Every Elemental is widely used. As I said, we use it. I presume if this is true,
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:15.920]   our motherboards were hacked, but then the story gets weirder. So 17 sources, anonymous sources,
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:23.840]   Bloomberg Business Week, highly credible source. The next day, Amazon, Apple, even the freaking
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:32.000]   Chinese government unequivocally deny it. They say it never happened. Apple said it was the story
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:40.320]   was wrong and misinformed. The Department of Homeland Security yesterday, well, actually their
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:47.440]   denial was a little less unequivocal. They said, we have no reason to doubt.
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:55.200]   We have no reason to doubt that Apple and Amazon are telling the truth. That's not exactly like
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:06:59.280]   no one ever happened. That's like, well, we have no reason in this particular circumstance.
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:07.120]   We currently have no reason to doubt. Nevertheless, the denials from Amazon and Apple were really strong.
[00:07:08.400 --> 00:07:12.000]   No, it didn't happen. Bloomberg is completely wrong. How does this happen?
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:19.200]   Actually, I'm going to poll you. We'll start with you, Rich. Who's right?
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:27.760]   Oh, man, I feel like this is the biggest fear of the tech world. All this stuff is made over in
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:34.640]   China. This is the perfect way of infiltrating the systems with a tiny chip that nobody recognizes
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:42.000]   or even cares to notice. They can take control of these things. They can modify the system on startup,
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.920]   whatever they want to do. It's tough for me to believe that Business Week has this many people
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:52.720]   saying this happened and it hasn't happened. I understand why these big companies, including
[00:07:52.720 --> 00:07:58.960]   Amazon and Apple, are strongly denying this because it's pretty bad for them if this happened to them.
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:06.560]   I believe it. I think that just reading the story, it's fascinating. I couldn't put this thing down.
[00:08:06.560 --> 00:08:11.760]   It's so well written and so like, I just wanted to know more and more and more.
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:19.200]   But I think what was missing in this story, to me, is the consequence, concrete, what they did
[00:08:19.200 --> 00:08:24.560]   with these little chips. Maybe I missed that, but I didn't see, did they take down something?
[00:08:24.560 --> 00:08:30.400]   Or is this all laying in weight for something that they want to do in the future? That was the
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:33.040]   part that I was confused upon. It's a great question.
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:35.680]   Ant, who do you believe?
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:44.400]   Initially, my gut is actually siding with Apple just because of their history regarding
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:50.640]   security and privacy. Why would they lie? That would be a big deal for Apple PR to issue.
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:56.240]   And they issue two statements. They come forth pretty quickly about it.
[00:08:56.240 --> 00:09:01.920]   And then I just think back to other scenarios in the past with Apple, as far as when we had that
[00:09:01.920 --> 00:09:06.400]   shooting at that school in California and they wanted to search the phones, and Apple was trying
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:12.640]   to do the right thing from a privacy and security standpoint. So my gut just says,
[00:09:12.640 --> 00:09:17.040]   I'm going to go with Apple. Now, had it just been Amazon saying, no, that's not true.
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:19.040]   I'd have had the hairy eye about it.
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:27.200]   Apple said specifically, quote, on this, I mean, this is as strong as you can get. We can be very
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:33.920]   clear. Apple has never found malicious chips, hardware manipulations, or vulnerabilities purposely
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:40.240]   planted in any server. Daniel Rabina, what do you think you've been covering this for a long time?
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:46.480]   What do you think? Yeah, I'm leaning towards this. This has just got to be some truth to this. Now,
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:51.200]   but we may not know what the exact details actually, we don't know the exact details. And there could
[00:09:51.200 --> 00:09:57.680]   be some crossed wires here and information. Maybe some hardware was shipped to Apple, but it was
[00:09:57.680 --> 00:10:04.960]   caught in time and never deployed it, in which case, both things could be true. But, yeah, you know,
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:11.600]   there's been a lot of reports around Huawei and other companies to write about this possibility,
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:16.720]   this threat. And it works both ways. You know, there's concerns to the US companies doing the same.
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:22.480]   I don't know. My honch says that there's probably some truth to this. It's just a question of,
[00:10:22.480 --> 00:10:29.280]   to what extent the damage was done. But none of this is surprising to anyone's been covering
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:35.760]   this industry for the last couple of years as this big concern over the strength of Chinese tech
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:42.640]   and its influence on US economy. Everybody knows that the way you wage war is changing from a pure,
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:50.240]   you know, military exercise to work technological or information in the case of what Russia has
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:56.800]   been doing or accused of doing a lot recently. So, just because the companies deny this stuff,
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:03.360]   if it's an issue of national security, they can be quite fucking told to don't talk about this,
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:09.040]   because you don't want to expose those vulnerabilities. Maybe there's active investigations going on.
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:15.120]   You we don't know all the details here, but I find it hard to believe with 17 sources that none
[00:11:15.120 --> 00:11:21.280]   of this is true. I think it's more about degrees at this point. Zach, what do you agree who writes
[00:11:21.280 --> 00:11:25.840]   about security at TechCrunch and has worked at most recently at CBS, he's been covering security
[00:11:25.840 --> 00:11:33.360]   forever. He says, welcome to the murky world of national security reporting. He he says,
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:43.520]   even with this story, my gut is mixed. There is one potential scenario that maybe means both of these
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:48.640]   that the companies aren't lying, but the story is true. I have to say, I have to add myself to this
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:55.040]   poll. There's no way Bloomberg Business Week runs this story unless and they stand behind it, by the
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:12:02.880]   way, unless they absolutely have unequivocal evidence of this 17 sources all anonymous. Yeah,
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:09.840]   but you'd have to say Bloomberg Business Week is making this up. This is this that's too many people
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:18.160]   to not be true. So here's maybe a very narrow, maybe the Apple PR team that responded and this
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:22.080]   was John Gruber's theory didn't know about it. Right? If something like this happens,
[00:12:22.080 --> 00:12:26.800]   you're not going to send out a memo at everybody in Apple saying, hey, by the way,
[00:12:26.800 --> 00:12:32.720]   look what we found. You're going to keep it very quiet. So maybe a handful of people at Apple
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:38.000]   know and the ones who don't know are the ones making the unequivocal denial. There's also
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.600]   possibility there's a US government gag order, although Apple again says we are in no way
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:49.760]   under a gag order. But again, maybe the people who are under the gag order
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:55.600]   are a handful of people, not the people writing the press release. That's the only way I could see
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:13:01.440]   both sides being accurate. And I don't I don't think Apple PR is lying in such an outright,
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:05.920]   they would say nothing or they would say little or they would say, there's lots of ways they could
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:11.920]   slice this without saying, no, it did not happen. Yeah, it's odd that they came out so strong
[00:13:11.920 --> 00:13:18.880]   in their denial of this like immediately and emailed the media, including myself. And that
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:24.800]   rarely happens when they, you know, usually the way Apple works is they kind of talk to the certain
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:28.960]   media that covers the beat that they want to get the story out with this time they just sent out
[00:13:28.960 --> 00:13:34.720]   a blanket email through their legal guy denying it and kind of linking to this, which I found to be
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:39.360]   very heavy handed. So it's like one of these things where you want to believe Apple, but at the same
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:44.160]   time, it seems like it's overly like what what do they understand they have a lot to lose in
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:48.800]   in this, but it just seems like they really want to make sure that like, no, we are not involved
[00:13:48.800 --> 00:13:54.160]   in this. This is not true at all. I wonder if their reporter is going to be invited to the next
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:14:03.920]   Apple event. That's Apple's stick, baby. Right. We won't be seeing you at the next Apple event.
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:09.680]   Somebody who hasn't been invited to an Apple event in years, I could say that stick isn't that
[00:14:09.680 --> 00:14:13.680]   is now weighty. Go ahead. I'm sorry. I was going to say another angle to this possibly is more
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:19.760]   the conspiratorial angle is that this is really a story. The US government has a vested interest
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:26.160]   in undermining Chinese tech, or at least eroding the trust in it for such circumstances. We all
[00:14:26.160 --> 00:14:32.960]   see no about that Qualcomm Broadcom attempt to buy out and how that was blocked. Do you think
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:40.320]   you got played by the US intelligence community? In a way, no, 17 seems like a lot. On the other
[00:14:40.320 --> 00:14:46.880]   hand, this is kind of what intelligence is supposed to be doing. And so I don't think we can discount
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:52.240]   it. I still think there's actually a threat from China in this sense because why it went
[00:14:52.240 --> 00:14:59.040]   in the day, right? It's just that's how counterintelligence works. We do the same thing. So there may be
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:04.640]   some, like I said, there may be some truth to this, but it may have been played up by some people in
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:13.360]   the government too. Even this current administration is very much against giving China too much leverage
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:19.840]   when it comes to manufacturing. And so I don't know. It's a hard story to follow and believe,
[00:15:19.840 --> 00:15:24.000]   especially when you're talking about espionage counterintelligence and national security.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.520]   Bloomberg breaks the company's denials are countered by six current and former senior
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:35.360]   national security officials who in conversations that began during the Obama administration
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:40.000]   and continued under the Trump administration, detailed the discovery of the chips in the
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:47.440]   government's investigation. This has been going on for several years. And it sounds like Bloomberg
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:52.800]   reporters have been working on this story for several years. One of those officials and two
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:58.640]   people inside Amazon provided extensive information on how the attack played out at elemental and
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:04.800]   Amazon. That's another thing you would not only have to, it's one thing to say, well, you can easily
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:11.920]   get 17 CIA people to say, yeah, this happened. I mean, that's their job. But then you're getting
[00:16:11.920 --> 00:16:18.160]   people inside Amazon saying confirming it. The details match the officials and one of the
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:22.080]   insiders also described Amazon's cooperation with the government investigation. In addition,
[00:16:22.080 --> 00:16:27.120]   to the three Apple insiders, four of the six US officials confirmed that Apple was a victim.
[00:16:27.120 --> 00:16:33.920]   17 people confirmed the manipulation of super micros hardware. The sources were
[00:16:33.920 --> 00:16:39.280]   granted anonymity because of the sensitive and in some cases, classified nature of the information.
[00:16:39.280 --> 00:16:45.120]   Daniel, it's an interesting theory, though. I kind of, maybe this is, you know, it's clear
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:51.280]   something's going on. Yeah, I think that's the truth. But we don't know what it is.
[00:16:51.280 --> 00:16:58.000]   Information warfare. It's the new battle of the 21st century. Super dangerous, super hard to counter.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.840]   It's who do you believe? Who do you trust? And when you undermine all institutions around you,
[00:17:03.120 --> 00:17:08.960]   people can't even trust new sources anymore. So it's a brave new world. It's not a, I'm kind
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:14.480]   of nervous about it. During my did political science, undermining classic institutions is the
[00:17:14.480 --> 00:17:18.960]   first way you destabilize society. So that's exactly right. Is a real threat to it.
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:23.360]   It's exactly right. Well, and from the consumer standpoint, I mean, obviously,
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:28.320]   this was kind of big server things. But for the average consumer, I think it makes you think twice
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:34.320]   too with everything that you have in your house. I mean, we're all putting these smart speakers
[00:17:34.320 --> 00:17:40.720]   in our homes. Yeah, where are those manufactured? I mean, this is becoming a reality for the average
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:44.640]   person to think about the stuff that we're carrying with us and the stuff that we're putting in our
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:50.880]   homes, the routers, the systems, and this becomes like very clear that, oh my gosh, like, this is
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:54.800]   something that, of course, we've thought of, but not into this detail. And you're just like,
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:18:01.680]   this is exactly how it's done in a big way. IoT is a huge security vulnerability right now.
[00:18:01.680 --> 00:18:05.600]   Microsoft's trying to counter with Azure Sphere, which has been in the headlines recently,
[00:18:05.600 --> 00:18:10.400]   is their first attempt at making these sort of systems more secure for everybody, anyone who's
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:14.640]   manufacturing devices. But right now, it's wild west, people are just putting microphones and
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:19.840]   internet into all these devices. We're putting them in our homes and there's no regulation or checks.
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:23.360]   It's going to come back to buy this. I guarantee it will. It's just a matter of time.
[00:18:23.360 --> 00:18:24.960]   Well, really, if you believe-
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:33.120]   As much as I said, I trust what Apple's response was, at the same time, I still have that little
[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:39.280]   fear in the back of my head of the button that the Chinese could just push at any time because of
[00:18:39.280 --> 00:18:45.440]   everything that I'm looking at right now was not made right here in the US. And they could easily
[00:18:45.440 --> 00:18:51.520]   just push a button to make things just go nuts on me and maybe cause some even bigger problems
[00:18:51.520 --> 00:18:57.040]   if they want to, because we don't know. I can crack this machine open and I don't know what
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:19:00.960]   all of these transistors and capacitors and all of that. I don't know what any of that stuff
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:05.680]   is doing. I just know what it's my motherboard. Well, I mean, you make an excellent point.
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:10.560]   Very few people understand the complexity of our modern world and if you are still
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:15.920]   understand the security issues and could detect these problems. And if you have a determinate
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:22.560]   adversary with governmental, with nation state level resources behind them, even if it's just
[00:19:22.560 --> 00:19:30.560]   North Korea, it seems to me that it would be very, very difficult if you had somebody
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:35.440]   wanted to do this to prevent it. Everything is made in China, almost everything.
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:41.600]   So the supply chain is coming out of China. And even if you're buying a phone made in Korea
[00:19:41.600 --> 00:19:47.680]   or Taiwan or Thailand or India or Brazil, many of the parts are made in China.
[00:19:47.680 --> 00:19:54.160]   So I doubt there's one consumer electronic device in your house that it hasn't something
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:20:01.120]   that was manufactured in China. I'm sitting here looking at junk on my desk. This is a
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:05.280]   power distribution board. Pretty sure this was not made in the USA.
[00:20:06.480 --> 00:20:14.160]   Say Super Micro on it. It's like the equivalent of the Intel inside sticker. Can you imagine if
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:18.160]   Super Micro had one of those and now everyone just sees those? I'm going to go from the flip side
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:24.640]   though on the fact that China knows that all this stuff is big business. And I think, I mean,
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:29.040]   clearly, we love to believe in these conspiracy theories and we love to imagine that it's like
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:35.040]   us versus them versus Russia. I do think there, of course, are elements of that in our world.
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:39.760]   But at the same time, I want to believe that they know that the business that they're going to make
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:45.360]   off these components are way better than the business they're going to make off of the whatever
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:50.240]   marketplace they're dealing with. Absolutely. With the shady stuff. What's going on in China
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:55.680]   and it's true in other places too, is there's more than one constituency.
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:21:00.800]   So there are absolutely, I would say most of the Chinese government wants to maintain good
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:06.320]   relations because after all, we're their biggest market. On the other hand,
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:12.240]   and this heck, it's presumed came from the Chinese military. I'm sure hardliners in the
[00:21:12.240 --> 00:21:17.040]   Chinese military say, "Yeah, let's just in case, let's be ready for cyber warfare."
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:23.360]   I don't think it's monolithic in other words. And I completely agree with you, Daniel. This
[00:21:23.360 --> 00:21:28.880]   completely could be a conspiracy from the United States government who wants us to say exactly that.
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:33.040]   It's crazy.
[00:21:33.040 --> 00:21:38.960]   The only way America can hack the rest of the world is by putting something in a frappuccino.
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:42.720]   That's the only thing we're exporting is Starbucks.
[00:21:42.720 --> 00:21:46.480]   Wait, I got Facebook though. Facebook I hear is not so security.
[00:21:46.480 --> 00:21:47.760]   Yeah, that's a good point.
[00:21:47.760 --> 00:21:55.280]   What a world. What a world we live in. But it was almost inevitable when the tools we use got so
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:22:03.120]   complex. Jerry Pournell, I've mentioned this to Jerry before he passed in his book, Lucifer's
[00:22:03.120 --> 00:22:08.480]   Hammer. The story is that a giant asteroid hits the United States. Great book.
[00:22:08.480 --> 00:22:12.720]   Yeah, isn't it good? And there's just a few survivors in the world who kind of have to cobble
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:19.280]   together existence again. But he points out that we live in a world where we use stuff every day.
[00:22:19.280 --> 00:22:24.560]   We have no idea how it works, nor could we recreate it if we had to.
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:30.960]   And that's your car. That's your freaking microwave oven, let alone your computers and your phones.
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.040]   I'm guilty. We're all guilty.
[00:22:33.040 --> 00:22:38.400]   And I don't think there's any one person who could do this who could recreate this.
[00:22:38.400 --> 00:22:48.080]   So that's kind of the consequence of that is there's a huge amount of trust in using all of
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:53.840]   this stuff. And if you had an actor who decided that he didn't care about being trusted or
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:23:01.520]   wanted to subvert this, it's a little, is it chilling or is it industrial espionage?
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:07.360]   So a lot of these servers are used by the Department of Defense. These elemental servers alone
[00:23:07.360 --> 00:23:20.080]   are used all over the place, the CIA, the NSA, they're used in drone placement. They're used
[00:23:20.080 --> 00:23:23.920]   controllers controllers. They're used all over the place.
[00:23:23.920 --> 00:23:29.440]   But okay, but here's the question. Has anyone cracked one of these open and found this little
[00:23:29.440 --> 00:23:32.960]   chip? I mean, wouldn't that be the first thing that one of these companies would do is kind of
[00:23:32.960 --> 00:23:36.480]   look in there? I mean, I know it's only been a couple of days since the story came out, but
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:40.080]   wouldn't that be part of this reporting?
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:43.840]   I mean, I think that's what the original production did say was that the
[00:23:44.400 --> 00:23:51.040]   when Amazon was looking to buy elemental, they sent their boards into for review to a third party
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:55.600]   company who found a little chip on there that was not part of the original diagram
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:24:00.800]   designed for that chipset. And that's what the red flag was. And then I think trying to figure
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:05.280]   out what it does or its potential was a matter of sort of reverse engineering it.
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:10.400]   Well, I can imagine everybody who has a super micro mother board and has the capability.
[00:24:10.400 --> 00:24:14.000]   The problem is who has the capability? There's a lot of little chips on there. Have you ever
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:18.400]   looked at a little mother board? And they're labeled and but I mean, I don't know how you would have
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:22.160]   to you would have to take the thing apart, test each one individually.
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:23.440]   All right.
[00:24:23.440 --> 00:24:24.240]   Non-trivial.
[00:24:24.240 --> 00:24:25.760]   And who has those resources?
[00:24:25.760 --> 00:24:30.080]   An elemental cost $30,000. I am not taking my elemental.
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:35.680]   And I actually proposed this to our engineering team. I said we have because we have a new elemental
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:41.680]   from AWS. So that we just got a few months ago. So that will not obviously. But we had the old
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:46.800]   elemental from this timeframe. We were using it back then. But unfortunately, we had to send it back.
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:49.200]   But where's the I fix it tear down?
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:50.560]   Yeah, I want to tear down.
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:53.280]   I fix it. Maybe could do that.
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:25:00.320]   Yeah. They specialize in identifying unlabeled or poorly labeled or incorrectly labeled chips.
[00:25:00.320 --> 00:25:06.160]   I think we all we can all agree that this is there's potential for this to happen,
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:12.960]   whether it actually did happen or not. And I think Bloomberg didn't get it wrong.
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:19.920]   I just don't understand what happened, what the response is and why the response is that.
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:24.640]   And I don't think it's I don't think Apple is so venal is to say, well, that will hurt our business.
[00:25:24.640 --> 00:25:29.520]   We better lie about it. I agree with you in that case. There's no way that's the case.
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:33.360]   I think it's much more that whoever issued this release didn't know if anything.
[00:25:34.800 --> 00:25:38.480]   Nobody's nobody's talking. Maybe even Tim Cook doesn't know. I don't know.
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:43.680]   All right. I thought that would be fun to start with a mystery story. Let's take a break.
[00:25:43.680 --> 00:25:48.160]   We'll come back and talk about stuff we do know. One thing we know an awful lot about is what
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:54.720]   the Google event on Tuesday is going to be. This is the most leaked product I have ever seen in my
[00:25:54.720 --> 00:26:02.240]   life. Oh, you okay. So there. So you think there's well, let's find out you have a theory about why
[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:05.440]   all this stuff has been leaked. Maybe maybe this is intentional.
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:11.040]   Once twice a week, I get that. When you get into there's 12 different leaks.
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:19.040]   Engage it today. One bought a Pixel three from a Hong Kong supplier and they did an unboxing.
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:25.280]   It's not announced yet. And it's calculated PR. All right. All right. I want to hear your
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:28.640]   theories. Let's take a break. Aunt Pruitt is here. Always great to have Aunt.
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:35.360]   Contributing writer tech, Republic photographer. You still doing the Friday night videos at YouTube?
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:42.560]   It's paused right now because of football season. Like it's playing ball. And sometimes we end up
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:48.640]   traveling Friday night for football. So I've sort of been doing them here and there just to keep
[00:26:48.640 --> 00:26:53.680]   them rolling. But I still love doing it when I can. It's nice. There are plenty of them on
[00:26:53.680 --> 00:27:00.080]   Aunt's YouTube page. You have lots to look at. Also, Daniel Rubino is here. He is executive
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:07.040]   editor at Windows Central. One of the key Windows Microsoft journalists out there. We'll talk about
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:11.680]   the Surface event just a little bit. And kind of a big oops. In fact, when we come back, let's talk
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:20.880]   about it. The big oops from Microsoft. Rich D'Amuro from KTLA, richontech.tv is his website. His
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:26.240]   podcast is there. His stories are there. And you can catch them on KTLA. Channel 5 in Los Angeles.
[00:27:26.240 --> 00:27:30.560]   Did you warn your viewers about the sonic boom coming up in a couple hours?
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:37.760]   Oh my gosh. I did not. But I think our news did. I did. I warned them. Of course, KFI was
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:45.680]   preempting the show for football. But you still said it. I said it. The SpaceX is launching a Falcon
[00:27:45.680 --> 00:27:53.040]   9 from Vandenberg tonight. John Slanina, our space enthusiast here, says that the launch
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:28:00.720]   window is a satellite. The launch window for this is instantaneous. If they don't launch it at 728,
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:06.640]   they're going to have to wait until tomorrow. Part me, 738. Thursday. They have to wait until
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:09.600]   Thursday. I have nothing about this. Yeah, I see this from anywhere.
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:17.920]   Well, you'll hear it in Santa Barbara and Lompok anywhere in that area because they expect,
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:23.120]   in fact, Elon tweeted. What's this tweet? It was pretty funny. Oh no. Should he be tweeting?
[00:28:23.120 --> 00:28:29.360]   Should he be tweeting? Should you be tweeting, Elon, really? But of course, if you're going to
[00:28:29.360 --> 00:28:34.640]   follow Elon Musk, you got to, he says, get ready because it's going to be a loud boom.
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:40.480]   Sonic boom. I can't wait. Sonic boom warning, Elon Musk tweets. This won't be subtle.
[00:28:40.480 --> 00:28:49.200]   And it'll be the first time they've ever landed one of the SpaceX rockets on the land in the
[00:28:49.200 --> 00:28:55.200]   on the West Coast. So yeah, we'll watch that video 728 tonight. Maybe they'll do it in the football
[00:28:55.200 --> 00:29:02.080]   game as they pause the game. They better not. That's all. Watch the no, no, no, I'm not even
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:07.040]   trying to go there. As much as I love my science and tech, do not screw around with my football
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:13.840]   game. Not mess with my football game. Texans, Cowboys, be there. I showed today brought to you
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:25.440]   by IT Pro TV, a recent study from MIT found that IT occupations between 2004 and 2017 grew 19.5%.
[00:29:25.440 --> 00:29:28.960]   That's eight times the growth rate for other jobs over that past decade.
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:34.320]   Eight times. And I know from from other research that there are one million
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:42.080]   IT security jobs unfilled ready for you. This is a great career path. If you're watching this
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:46.480]   show, you obviously love tech listening to show you obviously love tech. If you're
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:51.040]   thought about a career in IT, we I talked to so many people every day when people come to the
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:54.800]   studio, they say, you know, I'm an IT because it because I became a geek because of you.
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:59.200]   IT Pro TV is the way to get the skills to get the job because unfortunately,
[00:29:59.200 --> 00:30:04.080]   if you just start an IT, you need to get those certifications. That's how you prove to your
[00:30:04.080 --> 00:30:08.720]   future employer that you you've got the skills. A lot of people go to technical schools for the
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:14.320]   spend tens of thousands of dollars or try to do it themselves on their own. That's hard to.
[00:30:14.320 --> 00:30:21.200]   IT Pro TV makes it easy to start a career in IT or if you're already an IT to accelerate your career.
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:26.720]   4,000 hours of binge worthy on demand training. You can watch anywhere. They have iOS and
[00:30:26.720 --> 00:30:33.120]   Android apps. You can watch it on your web browser. You can Chromecast it. They have a Roku app,
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:38.480]   Amazon Fire TV app. They have Apple TV apps. And so that means you can watch it on your big screen,
[00:30:38.480 --> 00:30:42.960]   hop in the car, listen on the way to work, put it in the little window on your work computer
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:49.520]   and absorb that information. Everything from the CompTia search to the Cisco search, EC cancel,
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:56.480]   VMware. They've recently added some really nice organization. They have so much content. They
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:31:03.280]   add more content. They do live streaming. So adding dozens of hours every week and they've
[00:31:03.280 --> 00:31:07.760]   really done a nice job of organizing this by category, by cert, by job role. They've got a
[00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:12.320]   great search engine. So you can find the courses you want. If you watch live, you can chat along
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:16.720]   with them. And they really are engaging knowledgeable hosts. They pick them first because of their
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:21.440]   knowledge. They're all professionals from the field. But then also because they've got great
[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:25.680]   personality and they're engaging and fun to watch, you're going to really enjoy it. Learn IT,
[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:31.280]   pass your certs, accelerate your career. If you have a team, they have a team portal for you,

[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:44.720]   strangest place in the West Village. I saw pictures, Microsoft had set up couches
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:52.320]   and invited a bunch of journalists with laptops. But nowhere to put them to cover
[00:32:52.320 --> 00:32:59.680]   the new service release, nor did they stream it. It was the strangest thing.
[00:33:00.480 --> 00:33:05.520]   In fairness, this was a similar repeat to how they did Surface Book 2 last year.
[00:33:05.520 --> 00:33:13.280]   That too was not streamed and was although that was a brighter environment. It actually was a
[00:33:13.280 --> 00:33:16.320]   cool bet. It was done well. I liked it. You had fun. Very chill.
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:21.040]   You said something interesting, Panos Panay, who's in charge of hardware at Microsoft,
[00:33:21.040 --> 00:33:25.440]   you said gave the best, most inspiring talk you've seen.
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:34.480]   Yeah. He was going on about being creating and them making the right tools to enable people to
[00:33:34.480 --> 00:33:42.640]   go out and do their jobs. He again brought in his children. It's been a recurring theme in his
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:48.080]   talks. That's not just a brag about his adorable kids, but also just to talk about the human
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:55.360]   element technology. He showed his daughter playing piano in this one moment she had where she got
[00:33:55.360 --> 00:33:59.040]   really inspired because she was kind of nailing it. He was talking about how we all have these
[00:33:59.040 --> 00:34:02.560]   moments during the day where we get really inspired and everything just kind of clicks.
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:07.520]   And that's what technology is supposed to do. He always gives these kind of really inspiring
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:15.680]   talks. But this one was probably one of his best considering the event, which what was announced
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:21.600]   was mostly refreshes versus a new form factor device that was really going to wow us.
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:28.640]   New black matte black surface pros, although so last year was a service pro no number,
[00:34:28.640 --> 00:34:31.200]   but it was the fifth. This year is the surface pro six.
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:38.560]   The surface laptop is the Alcantara black as well or just the yes, it's all black.
[00:34:38.560 --> 00:34:44.800]   It's all black. They have the other colors too. And then I love I'm using a surface studio
[00:34:44.800 --> 00:34:48.800]   and I was kind of hoping they didn't announce a new one because it's ridiculously expensive.
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:53.600]   And they did and it's even more expensive. It's been two years but $3,500.
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:59.360]   And it's kind of low end hardware, but the screen is just stunning. I don't I don't feel the
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:04.960]   urge to buy a new one. Here's a picture. The USB C. Yeah. It's by the way, can I point out the
[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:11.040]   only computer Microsoft sells with USB C? Well, it's a two. So it's book two.
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:15.280]   Oh, it has USB C. Okay, but not the laptop. That's right. The go does, doesn't it?
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:22.000]   Yeah. The go does go to go to type C, so pro and laptop does not. Yes. And Paul was,
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:28.400]   Paul Therat is pictured here in shorts along with Brad Sam's. By the way,
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:32.880]   Panos wasn't the only person who brought his kids. Apparently Bradley Cooper showed up with his baby.
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:39.200]   Yeah. Yeah. No, I didn't really hear about that till after the event as like, oh, okay. That's
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:43.440]   really weird. It is a weird. Yeah. But, wait, I want to go back to those.
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:49.040]   The couches because here's the thing, like this has always been kind of my problem with the surface.
[00:35:49.040 --> 00:35:54.960]   And I love the surface, the, you know, the pro, but like, isn't it really tough to actually type on it?
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:59.600]   It's not as marriage or flag calls. It's not lapable. Right. Something. Oh, yeah. Something
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:04.080]   that small is pretty, pretty difficult. Notice, by the way, Mary Jo Foley took this picture. She has
[00:36:04.080 --> 00:36:09.600]   an HP laptop that's sitting on the right on there that is lapable. Brad seems to be doing all right
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:15.360]   with his surface book. Paul is attempting, I think, to use a Surface Pro. Panos, Panos,
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:21.120]   took that. Oh, it's a surface laptop. Okay. He took it. Yeah. Yeah. He took it away. I don't
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:26.800]   know if Paul ever got it back. Nor did he get a new one. The lapable thing is strictly related
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:32.720]   to your leg size. That's not to say anything about Mary Jo, but I have very. It's actually,
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:37.280]   let's be, let's be more technically accurate. Fimmer length. Yeah. Fimmer length. Exactly.
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:42.320]   Yeah. So I have zero. I'm getting my surface out. You have to have a certain length femur.
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:48.960]   Yes. Otherwise you can't lap it. What is that there that you've got? This little old school
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:56.080]   Chromebook to 13 inch or what have you. It's tiny in my hands to me, but yet it's perfect for me to
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:37:03.040]   sit on the couch or whatever and just get some more. But I'm guessing, I'm guessing, looking at you,
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:09.040]   you have some pretty massive femurs. Well, maybe, maybe,
[00:37:09.040 --> 00:37:16.800]   but no, I just don't like to talk about a man's femurs in public, but just all the woman's
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:23.040]   femurs, right? Well, I definitely that's right out. Yeah. We know that that that's no longer okay.
[00:37:23.040 --> 00:37:30.080]   But think about the just the ability to type on these smaller devices in your lap is not necessarily
[00:37:30.640 --> 00:37:37.280]   your lap surface area, whatever. I think more about just how my hands are placed on a lot of
[00:37:37.280 --> 00:37:42.080]   smaller devices on my lap versus having them up on a tabletop or something. I don't mean to make
[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:46.320]   a huge thing out of it's not that big a deal. It is a cozy, nice event. It's just odd to bring
[00:37:46.320 --> 00:37:50.240]   all these journalists in their laptops in and make them put it on their lap. I can't part of
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:56.320]   that was because as much as we all want to take notes, we were live blogging it everything. They
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:38:02.080]   don't like we're actually going to this effect of chill out, relax. You know, you don't need to
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:06.800]   take every note here. And to be honest, the presentation was pretty vague anyway. So it was a lot of
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:11.760]   detail. It was just like service laptop to and surface process, but they didn't go into even talk
[00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:14.960]   about the actual processors. They just said like eighth generation. We don't know what the
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:20.400]   processors are. We do now. We do. I know at the events. Yeah, and we had to go dig around. But
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:24.080]   I could tell you all the way. Are they all why processors? What is it? Tell me about
[00:38:24.080 --> 00:38:30.080]   your you processor. So surface laptop and surface pro get the eighth generation you processors,
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:36.560]   but these are kibilake are so these are technically announced late 2017. Basically every laptop
[00:38:36.560 --> 00:38:41.920]   that we've been using from HP and Dell and Lenovo for the last year have used these processors,
[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:47.200]   but they are not are the brand new whiskey Lake series, which are actually coming out now,
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:52.480]   October, November from new Matter of fact from Dell and Lenovo and all that. So they are like
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:57.280]   actually kind of a general. I want to say generation because Intel's their eighth generation split up
[00:38:57.280 --> 00:39:02.480]   into like three generations. So confusing. It's just crazy. But they're using basically last year's
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:08.560]   chip. And this is key because I was hoping and I wrote an article talking about if they go with
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:16.240]   whiskey Lake, whiskey Lake allows them to get four extra PCIU lanes 12 16 versus 12. That's the
[00:39:16.240 --> 00:39:22.640]   big thing with the 15 Watts. And that would allow them theoretically to put on Thunderbolt three that
[00:39:22.640 --> 00:39:27.440]   now is going to have the type C connector and have it really be a Thunderbolt three port.
[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:31.360]   Everything they want to be. This is the big problem with type C. My point has always been,
[00:39:31.360 --> 00:39:37.200]   and I bet you it's why Microsoft didn't do it. It's confusing. That thing could be USB 3.1. It
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:42.720]   could be Thunderbolt three. It could support power. Maybe not. It could support video,
[00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:46.720]   but it might not. And you can't tell. You look at it. It's just this thing.
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:53.440]   They use the on surface go. So they do. I find I find the confusion argument a little bit getting
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:58.000]   old. Like I feel like you could do 3.1 with power delivery now and be fine. Thunderbolt three is
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:02.880]   another bag. But the reason they have such problems because Surface Pro has a Surface. The keyboard
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:08.560]   connect uses PCIU lanes. And the actual Surface Connect uses around four PCIU lanes too. You
[00:40:08.560 --> 00:40:13.840]   think of the Surface Connect port as basically a modified version of Thunderbolt three already.
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:18.640]   So when you do all that, you ran out of PCIU lanes. That's why they need the whiskey lane.
[00:40:18.640 --> 00:40:23.840]   That's why they need whiskey. But that would also involve a significant redesign both internally
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:28.000]   and also externally now with the ports. And it's clear they came into this with we're just going
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.480]   to refresh this line at a minimum cost. That's really what it is, right? It's not. Yeah.
[00:40:33.040 --> 00:40:37.840]   We have one product that does have Type-C. He knew Microsoft Surface headphones.
[00:40:37.840 --> 00:40:48.880]   That has a Type-C connector, but it's just for charging. These have multi-level noise canceling,
[00:40:48.880 --> 00:40:52.880]   which is kind of cool. Why do you think Microsoft is going into this business?
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:41:00.400]   Okay. I'll spoil the news here from our reporting and sourcing. The big story behind this event
[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:05.760]   was originally this event was going to be to announce a drama. The foldable pocketable PC.
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:11.600]   When you think of this event in that context, it all makes a little bit more sense because
[00:41:11.600 --> 00:41:16.320]   the Surface Pro, Surface Laptop and those other refreshes become little side stories that are
[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:21.680]   super cool, but they're not the main focus. And if you think of Surface headphones,
[00:41:21.680 --> 00:41:28.960]   they were supposed to be an accessory supposedly for Andromeda as a way for working with communication
[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:33.200]   as well as enjoying music and all that. That's why they came out of nowhere.
[00:41:33.200 --> 00:41:38.880]   But Andromeda is on the back burner or rather, they're doing a lot of work on the software
[00:41:38.880 --> 00:41:44.160]   experience because that's not straight Windows 10. That's Windows CoreOS, new Andromeda experience,
[00:41:44.160 --> 00:41:50.720]   which is now still being worked on. This has been leaked out and people have been talking about
[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:56.800]   Andromeda for months and months and months. What is a foldable tablet? I don't even know what that
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:42:02.400]   means. At least going by the patent designs and everything we hear, this is actually a two-screen
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:07.840]   device, but Microsoft has invested a lot of research into. You can just read their patents
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:12.640]   online about this because they're going to have a hinge in the center where the two screens meet.
[00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:18.800]   So they've been working on technology such that the way, if you have the curves, just like a book
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:24.640]   on the inside, the glass, just like a binding works, but they've been working on technology so that
[00:42:24.640 --> 00:42:29.760]   the light emitting from the LCD at that curve does not appear to be curved.
[00:42:29.760 --> 00:42:35.920]   Let me understand. There's a hinge. There's a in the middle, but is it one screen that folds?
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:42.800]   It's two screens. It's not a single LCD. We've seen that technology before. Samsung's supposedly
[00:42:42.800 --> 00:42:48.400]   working on it as well as LG. But these are two separate display. This is kind of like the
[00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:53.440]   courier thing that was rumored for you. Exactly. The roots of this go back to courier. It's the
[00:42:53.440 --> 00:42:57.600]   idea of a pocketable journal that you carry around with. So how big is this thing?
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:01.920]   We don't actually know. I believe it's between six and seven inches, but this is one of those.
[00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:06.640]   Yeah, it's supposed to actually be able to fold up and you should be able to fit it into your pocket.
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:12.160]   But we don't know the exact dimensions of it. They probably presumably have a few prototypes
[00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:18.080]   that they're toying around with. But the technology is you can use either display. It rotates around,
[00:43:18.080 --> 00:43:23.120]   you can keep the displays open, then they can turn off independently. I've seen some of the
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:29.040]   way that software operates already. It looks like a combination. If you take Windows 10,
[00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:32.480]   what's the elements of Windows 10 mobile with some of the gestures of Windows 8,
[00:43:32.480 --> 00:43:37.280]   this is what this kind of looks like. There's still a start menu, but it's sort of like the
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:43.120]   start menu in Windows 10. You can bring up an app list. You have swipe gestures. And when you
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:47.840]   turn on the device, the first thing that comes up is a new app called JournalApp that you take notes
[00:43:47.840 --> 00:43:53.840]   on. But it's built around the idea of a pen and this idea of inking. It's not a phone,
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:59.200]   but it can make phone calls. Don't call it the surface phone. They'll get upset.
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:07.920]   Exactly. It's supposed to redefine what a companion possible PC is supposed to be in 2019,
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:13.280]   2020, whatever it's supposed to come out. It's this idea. If you take a phone today,
[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:17.360]   like a smartphone, how we use them, and you start from scratch and be like, "Okay, do people even
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:23.200]   make phone calls?" Any more? No. Okay. So it's rethink about what people are doing on these
[00:44:23.200 --> 00:44:28.080]   things and want to do with them. It's clear people want large displays, but in a form factor,
[00:44:28.080 --> 00:44:32.880]   they can carry around. This is actually pretty cool. Is what you know about this all from the
[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:39.120]   patent filings or are there other? No, no. Because we've seen bits of the operating system
[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:44.880]   that we've talked to people. It's very... It's the verge. I'm wearing it in Oracle. I mean,
[00:44:44.880 --> 00:44:50.880]   this is supposed to be Panos Penez Pet Project, basically. It's his kind of
[00:44:50.880 --> 00:44:57.200]   ultimate device. It would be... It would be a big deal if they released this.
[00:44:57.200 --> 00:45:04.400]   Potentially, iPhone level device. I can see why Penez might hit just start of this.
[00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:11.200]   Do you think it really was supposed to be an Andromeda event? Yeah. We've been
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:15.840]   anticipating this was going to be the event going back to the beginning of the year and even a
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:23.440]   little bit late 2017. They have... I would describe them as windows where they try to launch
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:27.600]   hardware, but it all comes down to... You've got to be able to make it. You can't... I mean...
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:32.480]   Yeah. I was like, even Surface Studio, I was like, "Why did you guys release this now?" And they simply
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:36.800]   said, "Because it's ready." And that's when they release hardware. It's that simple. It's like,
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:42.400]   when it reaches a threshold and they feel confident about it. In this device, there's a lot riding
[00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:46.240]   on it. They've got to really thread a needle on it to get it right. And so I don't think they're
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:51.680]   going to release it until they have the entire OS operating experience solid and they can actually
[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:57.920]   believe in it. So it's not Windows 10 as we have it now. It's a modified version of Windows 10.
[00:45:57.920 --> 00:46:02.880]   It's called... Yeah, it's called Windows Core OS. If you think of what you see as the exterior
[00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:10.000]   of Windows 10 these days with minus all the bloat from the last 25 years, 30 years of Windows,
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:16.320]   the legacy aspects. They're kind of taking the best aspects of how Chrome OS runs,
[00:46:16.320 --> 00:46:21.440]   but it looks like Windows 10. And there's different UI experiences. So there's one called Polaris for
[00:46:21.440 --> 00:46:27.760]   desktop. There's Aruba, which is what the Hub 2 is called. There's one for HoloLens. And then
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:32.880]   there's going to be one for mobile called Andromeda. And so these all have flexible UIs that can adapt
[00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:39.440]   to the hardware, but they can also... They don't require bulky processors and a lot of horsepower.
[00:46:39.440 --> 00:46:45.120]   So it's sort of like how Windows 10 mobile was just... But even Windows 10 mobile is built off of
[00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:50.400]   legacy software. And we see this... Panos Pena, if he's listening, just shivered.
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:59.360]   No! Yeah, yeah. Don't compare us. Yeah, if you think of it as that, we're seeing it in front of us.
[00:46:59.360 --> 00:47:04.720]   Every time they change, they take legacy control panel systems and put into the new settings.
[00:47:04.720 --> 00:47:11.040]   That's part of this. They're shifting all the core code, which has been written for 20 years,
[00:47:11.040 --> 00:47:16.240]   and they have to go through it a shell and decouple it. It's always raffling me because they keep the
[00:47:16.240 --> 00:47:21.120]   old control panel and they put in the new control panel. All that does is confuse users,
[00:47:21.120 --> 00:47:24.240]   but makes a little bit more sense if this is a direction they're heading.
[00:47:24.240 --> 00:47:28.000]   Yeah, if you look at the fall update, which we'll want to talk about,
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:33.600]   they've been taking even aspects of drivers and everything and putting it. And so the OS is
[00:47:33.600 --> 00:47:41.360]   becoming UWP. It's becoming that design. There'll always be Windows 10 Pro for enterprise,
[00:47:41.360 --> 00:47:46.400]   hospitals and all that, but where they're going... When you say UWP, are you talking... I mean,
[00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:50.000]   that's the Microsoft Store apps, but are you talking like Windows 10s?
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:57.280]   Yeah, it will be a form of Windows 10s. That's the Windows that will only run apps from the store.
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:48:02.080]   No other apps. Yeah, exactly. That's their future. There will be solutions to running
[00:48:02.080 --> 00:48:09.520]   Win32, which are called Vail and Rail, which are methods to stream either locally through
[00:48:09.520 --> 00:48:15.440]   containerized versions of Win32 or through streaming. So they have solutions for that. But
[00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:18.560]   this mind you were talking about where Windows will be in five to 10 years.
[00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:24.160]   That's where they see it going. Here's a mockup of what this might look like.
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:32.400]   Yeah. Mr. L'Forte, you said a second ago, "Wow, this is cool. What do you find cool about this in
[00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:38.160]   particular?" Obviously, you do not, right? You would be caught dead carrying this thing.
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:41.680]   Is that what you said? I'm with you. I'm trying to figure out, I agree. I'm like,
[00:48:41.680 --> 00:48:45.680]   "I don't know if I need this." Oh, you want it. Oh, come on. Let me tell you a bit.
[00:48:45.680 --> 00:48:52.240]   I love the idea, but I just... I carry around, and I think you all do a slab of glass,
[00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:58.000]   your smartphone. That's not a phone. That's what's interesting about this thing. The form
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:03.280]   factor of this thing is based on it being a phone, but it hasn't been a phone in a few years.
[00:49:03.280 --> 00:49:11.280]   It's time to stop the phone part of this thing, because it's... That's why we got notches
[00:49:11.600 --> 00:49:17.280]   that's why. I mean, this slab of glass is not the ideal form factor for a computer. Let's face it.
[00:49:17.280 --> 00:49:24.000]   Right? But we draw on a line, though. We know that this is not a full-fledged laptop or desktop.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:28.640]   We just know that this is an extension of those laptops and desktops that we have.
[00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:35.360]   Here's a thought exercise for you, Ant. If you acknowledged, "Okay, people want a portable device
[00:49:35.360 --> 00:49:40.400]   they carry in their pocket that does a few things." It does do phone calls in messaging,
[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:47.680]   but it also has maps and GPS. I can run apps on it, and maybe even get some productivity done.
[00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:53.440]   Although, I think for most people, that's not a big deal. If you could start from scratch,
[00:49:53.440 --> 00:50:00.800]   what would you make that thing look like? Not like that. Is it too big? Is that what you
[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:03.360]   don't like about it? It looks like you don't have a problem with the song.
[00:50:03.360 --> 00:50:07.920]   E-like what were those called? Yeah. That's why I said "Pano's Pane" does not like it when you say
[00:50:07.920 --> 00:50:12.240]   "Windows Mobile," because that was an... They do want distance themselves from that.
[00:50:12.240 --> 00:50:15.200]   Yeah, that was a flop. But this has a thing for the phone.
[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:18.240]   I should point out, this is a render based on those patents. This is not...
[00:50:18.240 --> 00:50:24.000]   Correct. Yeah. But let's just think about a few different use cases out there. You have your
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:28.880]   enterprise people that could potentially use it in sales or something like that, or marketing,
[00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:33.600]   or what have you. You have your creative folks, and you have just your regular,
[00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:39.440]   average people, consumers. All right. So if you look at those three different
[00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:44.240]   verticals, what are they using it for? The sales guys could probably use your smartphone for.
[00:50:44.240 --> 00:50:50.880]   Hit right. You beat them to my point. What's the point of this, when the smartphone is probably
[00:50:50.880 --> 00:50:57.200]   going to do the exact same thing that this larger device can do and take up less real estate in
[00:50:57.200 --> 00:51:02.000]   my bag or in my pocket? We're already seeing people making these phones bigger and bigger.
[00:51:02.000 --> 00:51:08.080]   Apple's new 10S Max. The Note 9. And the Note 9 are really on the edge of
[00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:12.880]   too big for this form factor, right? All right. All right. I agree with that.
[00:51:12.880 --> 00:51:17.040]   So you don't need to make these much larger than that. There's a desire, though, for a bigger screen.
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:21.440]   Samsung's rumored to be working on it. I mean, they basically flat out
[00:51:21.440 --> 00:51:26.480]   omitted their work on a dual screen device, too. It operates differently. But if you look at what
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:32.720]   Samsung's doing with decks, the Note 9 plugs right into any type C monitor, becomes a basically
[00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:39.600]   computer. It has a pen. All computing is going down this road of making these things more powerful.
[00:51:39.600 --> 00:51:42.400]   The problem, I would say, with Samsung and Android is they have to hack around
[00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:46.160]   Android to get it to do what they want, where Microsoft is doing it experience natively.
[00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:49.760]   Well, and you know, as a huge advantage as Apple, there's an on-tech just reviewed the
[00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:54.160]   10S Max and said, "These chips are almost as fast as desktop chips." Sure.
[00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:59.680]   And then Apple's about to do all of their own silicon. And they'll probably add a pencil support
[00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:04.080]   in the coming years. So now that doesn't just because everybody says that's the next thing,
[00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:07.680]   doesn't mean that consumers are going to say it, obviously. But you have to take a little bit of a
[00:52:07.680 --> 00:52:14.560]   chance. And just because it's that I think this is legacy, I'm holding up a smartphone. I think
[00:52:14.560 --> 00:52:19.280]   that's a legacy design. And it's a real holdover to really the phone. It's based still on looking
[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:24.320]   like a phone. And so that's why I say it makes sense to maybe think about, well, what would you
[00:52:24.320 --> 00:52:30.800]   want for a pocket computing device? But what don't you like about this? What is wrong with this?
[00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:36.000]   It just seems like it's trying to solve a problem that doesn't exist.
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:40.480]   And I think you could say that about all technology though. If you go back to it.
[00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:44.400]   Right. A lot of it. There's a lot of tech that's doing that. And it just sort of
[00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:52.000]   I don't have a problem with trying to innovate. But I think there are a lot of times where
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:57.360]   these companies are just doing just too much. I'm like, really, that's not necessary. I mean,
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:04.480]   even when we look at the VR space from two, three years ago with wearing the headsets that
[00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:09.760]   you put your phone in and all that and didn't have a controller that worked with a dang and
[00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:15.280]   they're supposedly iterating on that technology. But just how far is that going to go from a
[00:53:15.280 --> 00:53:22.880]   consumer standpoint? What are the applications for that? That's going to look good at the
[00:53:22.880 --> 00:53:27.600]   ledger. Is it too big? I don't I don't I kind of like the idea of that though because it
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:32.320]   you know, they're bringing that technology to everyone. They're saying all you need is a phone
[00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:35.680]   and a piece of cardboard. I mean, that's what Google's kind of approach was at the beginning.
[00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:39.360]   I thought that was cool. Right. That was really cool. I don't think that's the end all.
[00:53:40.640 --> 00:53:44.560]   Yeah, well, that's Google for you. And I'm not going to say Google's there.
[00:53:44.560 --> 00:53:50.880]   Not don't be evil. That's cool. But we give up. Yeah, they have an attention span worse than
[00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:55.280]   like a two year old. I mean, it's literally it's like Gmail has been the longest thing going that
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:54:00.800]   they have put out in search and not kill inbox. Everything it's just it ever this is what I say
[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:04.560]   with like, you know, even with like the mesh networking that Google has, you know, their system
[00:54:04.560 --> 00:54:09.040]   works perfectly fine. But it's like they do a big launch for it. And then Google Wi-Fi, you never
[00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:12.800]   hear about it again. And then ignore it. Yeah. To be fair with the same thing with all our
[00:54:12.800 --> 00:54:18.240]   reality. Virtual reality will be forever niche and related to gaming. And that's totally fine.
[00:54:18.240 --> 00:54:23.200]   It's very good at that. But the future there by else knows is the reality is
[00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:28.880]   mixed. Or mixed is Microsoft. Yeah. Exactly. Yeah. I mean, Microsoft has been, I mean,
[00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:33.520]   upfront, they're trying to invent and they may already be working on it. Basically, a system of
[00:54:33.520 --> 00:54:38.800]   goggles that switches between VR and mixed reality, the idea they they tend when you want to do
[00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:42.720]   virtual and then go clear for augmented. Yeah. So you can be augmented reality. That's the
[00:54:42.720 --> 00:54:46.000]   word that technology. I think people don't want imagine you're wearing these glasses and all
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:50.480]   sudden they tend you can't see what's going on around you. That's just not a good user interface.
[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:54.400]   So ultimately, people won't be doing that so much. Maybe if you're sitting in a chair at home and
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:59.600]   you're safe, you'll play a game. It's funny. The show, the first on Hulu with Sean Penn,
[00:54:59.600 --> 00:55:04.560]   I love that show, by the way, they all have this on this is they put him on and he tends to actually
[00:55:04.560 --> 00:55:11.440]   do augmented and virtual reality. Yeah. He wants to show somebody a video of their son and he
[00:55:11.440 --> 00:55:16.640]   takes his glasses off and says here. And then they and then he says, "Q up, rewind, play."
[00:55:16.640 --> 00:55:22.560]   And the guy and the father's wearing the glasses. And by the way, I want to point out that our
[00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:28.080]   guest last was it last week of the week before Amy Webb, the futurist, is the person who wrote the
[00:55:29.120 --> 00:55:34.240]   Bible for that show the first on what it would look like in 2030. It did a great job.
[00:55:34.240 --> 00:55:40.400]   Yeah, it's very credible. It's kind of like now, but a little bit more. Yeah, just a little bit
[00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:46.800]   tweet. Yeah. And they're all wearing something in their ear. So I do think that maybe that's the
[00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:52.560]   end game where the screen starts to kind of disappear and become a part of your stop. But
[00:55:52.560 --> 00:55:57.600]   we're not there yet. And then it makes sense. There might be an interim device that is a little
[00:55:57.600 --> 00:56:03.200]   bit of a bigger screen, a little bit more capability. I don't know. I mean, I think your reaction
[00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:08.640]   ant is really interesting because you're probably not alone that a lot of consumers ago. That? No,
[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:14.480]   thanks. Like why? I think that's common. I think but we can all go back to smartphones.
[00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:18.960]   I was using a trio back in 2006 and all my I was like, this is the coolest thing in the world.
[00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:23.680]   Oh, yeah. Oh, yeah. Just all computer. I showed all my friends. They could not care less. Yeah.
[00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:27.520]   They're like, and no one want to pay for data. No one got it. And now here we are.
[00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:32.640]   Everybody, if you don't have a smartphone, you're weird. So I find all technology seems unnecessary
[00:56:32.640 --> 00:56:37.440]   until everybody has. Yeah. But clearly, Microsoft's in position, they lost mobile.
[00:56:37.440 --> 00:56:41.040]   They've lost the phone stuff. So they're asking the next question. All right.
[00:56:41.040 --> 00:56:46.160]   What comes next after the current thing? And that's a hard question. I'm not saying this
[00:56:46.160 --> 00:56:50.320]   is necessary. The answer, I'm just saying that's the that's they're trying to go ahead of the
[00:56:50.320 --> 00:56:53.920]   curve. And that's what they're trying to answer. Every company in tech has to do that because
[00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:59.280]   you're only as good as your next product. You know, it's what I like about Microsoft is the
[00:56:59.280 --> 00:57:04.000]   attempt that they made for creators. Like that's that surface studio that you have right there in
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:10.240]   front of you. I love this thing. I think that thing is just awesome for a content creator that
[00:57:10.240 --> 00:57:16.080]   can sit down and really immerse themselves into their work and into their content that they're
[00:57:16.080 --> 00:57:22.880]   trying to create. And I personally wish Microsoft would continue along that road and making this
[00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:27.440]   stuff more accessible to creators out there that are trying to get started, whether it's the
[00:57:27.440 --> 00:57:32.640]   surface book, you know, just continue to make it robust and something that everybody can grab.
[00:57:32.640 --> 00:57:36.720]   Because every time I heard about the surface books in the last couple of years, they look
[00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:42.400]   great in their ads and all of the specs sound great, but it seems like every reviewer just poo-pooed
[00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:47.600]   them after, you know, a couple of weeks of use. The keyboard was this or that or the fabric on it
[00:57:47.600 --> 00:57:52.640]   felt weird and this was falling apart. The hinge wasn't just right. There was always something.
[00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:59.280]   That's our job. Yeah. Why not want to invest in that if everyone is complaining about it?
[00:57:59.280 --> 00:58:03.440]   I got I got a computer. They were going to get back to 1809 in a second, but I got a computer
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:12.960]   for you. The HP folio. It's a leather computer. How about that? Yeah. How about that?
[00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:19.120]   Really cool. You know, I mean, it's pigskin, by the way, that's pigskin. Yeah, just just keep
[00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:24.080]   throwing the right skin. Go ahead.
[00:58:24.080 --> 00:58:29.120]   Years ago, HP was a company. I just was not interested. They've completely converted themselves.
[00:58:29.120 --> 00:58:34.640]   Their stuff now is so good. The Spectre series, Elite Books, I absolutely adore their devices.
[00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:37.920]   I have the Spectre. I have the Spectre. It's the one with the copper and I really love it.
[00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:41.600]   Right. I really love it. And I'm just going to spoil. There's maybe some news and Spectre
[00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:46.960]   coming in a few weeks too. That's the part. The part that's really good stuff. But this one,
[00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:53.680]   the Spectre folio is a fascinating device. I have to tell people, go to when it comes out,
[00:58:53.680 --> 00:58:57.360]   go to Best Buy, check it out because they'll have one. Did you touch it? They announced it on
[00:58:57.360 --> 00:58:59.920]   Monday, the day before the microservice. Yeah, I was there at the press event for that.
[00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:03.760]   Yeah. So I got to play with it. It's a really cool device. How much is this thing?
[00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:07.200]   It starts at $12.99. It goes up to $14.99.
[00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:13.200]   Why? That's actually not bad. It's an executive PC. So it's kind of an M quality chip problem.
[00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:16.160]   Oh, oh, it's a little... It's a little... It's a little Y series. It's a little Y series.
[00:59:16.160 --> 00:59:20.560]   Like Y series, which, to their credit, HP told me they're like, "This device has been in the works
[00:59:20.560 --> 00:59:25.680]   for years, but it's only this year's chips that they felt was good enough to actually include it."
[00:59:25.680 --> 00:59:28.320]   And they said it's a really good chip set. Oh, you feel like it's fast enough?
[00:59:28.320 --> 00:59:35.040]   Yeah. Yeah, I got to use it. It's pretty good. But the $14.99 is the option with LTE built-in.
[00:59:35.040 --> 00:59:41.200]   It's supposed to get 18 hours battery life. Oh, oh. 14-inch-a-bit data. It's pretty silly.
[00:59:41.200 --> 00:59:46.400]   It's got... You can get later a 4K display with it. It's pen and inking. It does all the
[00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:51.680]   form factors. It's a really sweet device. I love their keyboards. It's not going to be for
[00:59:51.680 --> 00:59:55.920]   everyone. Yeah, as you described, it's for executives. It's meant for writing.
[00:59:55.920 --> 01:00:02.880]   And TV stars like Rich D'Amura. Yeah. I see this is my problem. I cannot use a Windows computer
[01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:09.200]   because I edit video and I feel like I have to have a MacBook Pro for that. And it really comes
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:13.600]   down to like, I actually love the surface. Like my choice would be like a surface.
[01:00:13.600 --> 01:00:21.040]   The original one. But I just... I can't do it. This is where we suffer as Apple fans,
[01:00:21.040 --> 01:00:25.280]   because only Apple makes the hardware and there just really isn't the diversity
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:30.480]   that there is in the Windows world. And that's why, by the way, Windows reviewers are picky.
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:34.640]   Because you can be. You have many, many, many choices. And if you don't like...
[01:00:34.640 --> 01:00:39.920]   Kind of like Android. Same thing. It's like there's... Why are there... The Android fan base is so
[01:00:39.920 --> 01:00:42.800]   picky on all these different... That's a good point. Yeah.
[01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:48.480]   It's because you have the choice. In Apple, it's just you go in there and you look at the phone,
[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:51.520]   you say that's what's available and you get the next one. Take it and leave it.
[01:00:51.520 --> 01:00:53.760]   Close enough. Don't like the touch bar too bad.
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:56.720]   You don't like having no home button? Too bad.
[01:00:56.720 --> 01:01:04.240]   All right. So that is the new leather HP. This is not a case. This is the actual body of the
[01:01:04.240 --> 01:01:08.640]   computer. Yeah. It's built right in... I mean, it's all around. It's really amazing engineering.
[01:01:08.640 --> 01:01:13.280]   I went into it. But it's very light. It's 2.6 pounds, I believe. It's thin.
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:18.000]   But it's really neat how the screen pops forward. It's like I was super thin this
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.840]   play. Yeah. They show it in one interesting... This is the interesting configuration where
[01:01:21.840 --> 01:01:26.400]   it's a... It's a kind of like you're watching a movie, but you still have a touch pad there.
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:29.600]   The keyboard is hidden behind it. The touch pad. And you can draw on it and...
[01:01:29.600 --> 01:01:34.480]   Yeah. Very... It's... It's like... It's kind of like how studio operates a little bit too.
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:39.360]   Yeah. Yeah. I love this. Whatever it is, 18 degree angle is just awesome.
[01:01:39.360 --> 01:01:43.120]   It feels like a drafting table or a drawing board. It's really nice.
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:46.720]   Well, I might be able to... What is this? Yeah. When does this folio come out?
[01:01:46.720 --> 01:01:51.600]   I believe probably November. It should be very soon now. It'll be a best buy and you can order
[01:01:51.600 --> 01:01:58.720]   direct from HP. And of course, I'm pretty sure I'll see HP next week because I'm attending Adobe Max.
[01:01:58.720 --> 01:02:02.240]   Oh, yeah. They'll be there. Yeah. And they usually have a presence there. But
[01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:06.640]   this particular device, I don't know if it really fits in, but we'll see. I got the
[01:02:06.640 --> 01:02:12.960]   receptors last year and they were awesome. I love my Spectre T. I have the first generation.
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:17.680]   The problem was it didn't have touch at the time. It doesn't... But now it does.
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:24.640]   Now you can get a stylus with them. By the way, they run Linux so nice. I'm not kidding.
[01:02:24.640 --> 01:02:34.400]   If you read to the end of the Wired article on this laptop, it says that HP considered going
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:39.600]   synthetic or vegan leather but decided to go with genuine despite the added cost because
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:44.080]   the cowhide that they're using is a by-product since they're sourcing it from a manufacturer that
[01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:51.280]   also uses cows for meat. It's leftover meat. And it says the leather can actually be reused when
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:56.560]   a customer has decided to move on from the laptop. It's deconstructable. And I both think that it's...
[01:02:58.640 --> 01:03:05.600]   HP is woke. Are they building a robot like Apple did to take the leather off and reuse it?
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:11.440]   People still like leather, Tan said. There are customers who want innovation in the PC category.
[01:03:11.440 --> 01:03:13.120]   So we're doing something new.
[01:03:13.120 --> 01:03:19.760]   I'm tied to it. I will say is it doesn't scratch. Like Surface laptop is... You can scratch it
[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:23.920]   pretty easily. So he doesn't scratch it. That magnesium deposition does. Yeah, you can scratch
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:30.400]   that right now. But it feels nice. This will age nicely like all leather does. And it'll look like
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:36.400]   an old baseball mitten a couple of years. I'm going to rub it with neat foot oil to really give it
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:42.960]   that potato. And maybe I'll wrap it around a baseball at night just to make sure the pocket is
[01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:52.640]   just so high. So headphones, three new Surface laptops, well Surface Studio and then the Surface
[01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:58.080]   tablet and then the Surface laptop. Do they announce a new Surface book as well? No.
[01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:05.040]   No, Surface book did not get a refresh or a new excuse. But that was a good one. But they'll
[01:04:05.040 --> 01:04:10.960]   probably time that later on. And then they announced, they talked a little bit about this weird Android
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:15.840]   Windows mix where you can display this screen from your Android phone on your Windows.
[01:04:15.840 --> 01:04:23.200]   And it's really new. Dell does this with an app called Dell Connect. And it's actually not built
[01:04:23.200 --> 01:04:28.720]   by Dell. It's by another company. Dell licenses it and then puts their name on it. Acer is doing
[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:32.960]   the same too. And that app is actually very good. Because what it does is it connects up through
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:38.320]   it appears by Bluetooth, but then it connects via Wi-Fi direct. And what's cool about that is it
[01:04:38.320 --> 01:04:43.360]   does all the same thing. You can stream apps from your phone to it. You can transfer photos. You can
[01:04:43.360 --> 01:04:50.240]   make phone calls. It's lightning fast and doesn't rely on an external network or cloud support. So
[01:04:50.240 --> 01:04:54.320]   you can even be on an airplane and use this thing direct. And so it's also better for security.
[01:04:54.320 --> 01:04:59.840]   Microsoft's not doing that. What they're doing is a version that connects up through Bluetooth
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:06.320]   and pairs that way. The probes of that is you can, of course, do the same thing. It also works with
[01:05:06.320 --> 01:05:12.640]   all hardware. If you go through the Wi-Fi direct method, the downside is you have to use modern
[01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:15.920]   hardware for it. And you just have to start restricting stuff. You need the right drivers and
[01:05:15.920 --> 01:05:20.800]   everything. So that's the reason why Microsoft's not doing it. They want to hit all PCs to be
[01:05:20.800 --> 01:05:25.200]   able to do this. So it won't be as good as Dell Connect. But at the same time, it'll be free.
[01:05:25.200 --> 01:05:29.760]   It'll be part of all Windows and work on all PCs out there. Is this going to be next year?
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:35.440]   Was this part of the Q1 H1? I mean, yeah, 19 H1. That's probably the goal for it.
[01:05:35.440 --> 01:05:40.000]   Yeah. Is this live? So I'm looking at the image that they showed at the event.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:45.680]   Is that live? I mean, can I edit it? No, it's just an image. Oh, yeah. Right now,
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:51.040]   that's just a mock up. So what they did, they did launch your phone that's available now in the
[01:05:51.040 --> 01:05:57.440]   October update where on Android, you can do text messaging and pull in all your photos or at least
[01:05:57.440 --> 01:06:01.040]   photos from the last one or something like that. And you can drag and drop them to your other apps.
[01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:04.400]   Interesting. Modify. So Apple has a lot of this capability with iPhones.
[01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:09.280]   And Microsoft doesn't have a mobile. So do it with Android.
[01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:15.360]   So works with Android. The texting part is really is unique because, you know,
[01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:21.200]   there's some apps that can do this. But I think that the fact that they're doing this makes it
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:25.680]   easier. And the 25 photos is kind of weird because you could just, I mean, if they're just going to
[01:06:25.680 --> 01:06:30.480]   Google photos, you can easily pull up your web page that has those. But I think the texting is
[01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:35.040]   cool. And the fact that they're doing this is nice because I don't know about the apps. I don't
[01:06:35.040 --> 01:06:39.840]   necessarily need access to my Android apps on my computer. Yeah, I'm not really sure what the
[01:06:39.840 --> 01:06:45.280]   use case for that is. But I think that the texting for sure is great. And we're able to play
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:48.960]   with that at all. Was it, I mean, is it just as smooth as it's not working? Is it?
[01:06:48.960 --> 01:06:54.000]   Yeah, not working code yet. But yeah. So third, I mean, but that was the same thing.
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:58.960]   A build a announced your phone and then it's out now with its current feature set. So they
[01:06:58.960 --> 01:07:02.400]   can turn us around in just a couple of months. I'm sure they'll have this. What they're doing
[01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:07.840]   isn't like rocket science. Not crazy. But it'll be an all right solution. I agree though, running
[01:07:07.840 --> 01:07:12.000]   Android apps like I use the Dell Connect version, which is even better because it's faster with
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:17.760]   Wi-Fi direct. It's, yeah, it's okay. I mean, it's not like running blue stacks in the Android
[01:07:17.760 --> 01:07:22.400]   direct, right? But you do get notifications direct through the Dell version, which is kind of cool.
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:27.360]   So someone, you know, messaged me on Instagram, I would actually get like a physical notification
[01:07:27.360 --> 01:07:33.120]   on my PC and I can respond to it directly without taking my phone and my bag. That's kind of cool.
[01:07:33.120 --> 01:07:37.760]   Well, to see if Microsoft does something similar. The downside for this is iOS.
[01:07:37.760 --> 01:07:43.920]   Really, the Dell Connect works with iOS, but the phone has to be unlocked and on to work.
[01:07:43.920 --> 01:07:48.480]   Okay, which is really not practical at all. Right. So those are the downsides.
[01:07:48.480 --> 01:07:52.560]   But I feel like if you want that tight integration with iOS, you're going to have an,
[01:07:52.560 --> 01:07:57.520]   you know, the other. I go Apple iPad and you're going to have a lot of that stuff anyway. I think
[01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:02.320]   this is for like everyone else, you know, that the business community, the people that have
[01:08:02.320 --> 01:08:09.120]   the Android and the, yeah. Where's your whiskey at? You usually have a whiskey around there.
[01:08:09.120 --> 01:08:18.080]   Well, sir, you did ask. Take a sip because we're going to take a break and fruit tech republic
[01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:24.240]   from KTLA rich tomorrow. And of course, from Windows Central, the great Daniel Ruben.
[01:08:24.240 --> 01:08:28.480]   It's good to have all three of you. I slept nice last night on my Casper. I hope you did.
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:36.480]   You don't have a Casper. What are you nuts? Casper is the mattress. Casper is an online
[01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:41.920]   retailer, premium mattresses for a fraction of the cost. And they are totally revolutionizing
[01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:46.960]   the mattress industry by, by eliminating the middleman, the showrooms, the resellers.
[01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:52.720]   Those people mark it up a lot. When I found out how much I was kind of aghast.
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:57.840]   Well, take out that extra markup. Get a great mattress, obsessive, more than great,
[01:08:57.840 --> 01:09:03.200]   obsessively engineered mattress at a price, much closer to cost, a fair price.
[01:09:03.200 --> 01:09:07.760]   The original Casper mattress, we have combines multiple supportive memory
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:12.480]   foams for a sleep surface with just the right sink and just the right bounce. It's nice to have
[01:09:12.480 --> 01:09:17.680]   both. You kind of sink into it, but at the same time, its firm. It supports you. And this is really
[01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:22.240]   important. I'm learning more and more how important this is. It's breathable, which means you sleep
[01:09:22.240 --> 01:09:26.240]   cool. Regulating your temperature through the night is one of the most important things to having a
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:31.360]   good night's sleep. Melatonin actually lowers your body temperature. I didn't know this. And that's
[01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:36.160]   really important part of sleeping well. Casper mattress does it for you. Long lasting comfort

[01:10:18.640 --> 01:10:24.880]   Here's my, here's my demo. I'm in my jammies because I'm planning to sleep on this thing.
[01:10:24.880 --> 01:10:31.360]   You open up the box. And watch the mattress just was
[01:10:31.360 --> 01:10:38.640]   and expands. This is, this was a king size mattress, I think. Was it a queen? It was a queen. It expands.

[01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:15.840]   kind of all that really matters in life is a good night's sleep. We had a fun, a fun week this week
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:21.520]   on twit. And in fact, we've made you a little promotional video for your Delectation watch.
[01:11:21.520 --> 01:11:30.000]   Previously on twit. Just got it. Just got it. This is a test of the, you got it too. All my
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:38.400]   phones are going off. Oh no. Help me. Help me. Oh my god. This week in Google, I brought Matthew
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:45.680]   on because of this article. Explain yourself, Matthew. Explain yourself in this. Columbia journalism
[01:11:45.680 --> 01:11:53.280]   is the podcast bubble bursting. Security now. We're going to take a look at this recent massive
[01:11:53.280 --> 01:12:03.360]   Facebook security breach, how a very clever leveraging of a subtle mistake was turned into a
[01:12:03.360 --> 01:12:09.280]   mess for Facebook and, and what lessons we can learn from it. Tech news weekly. The big news this
[01:12:09.280 --> 01:12:14.720]   morning involves a report released by Bloomberg that illustrates how Chinese spies reportedly
[01:12:14.720 --> 01:12:21.280]   have hacked their way into the supply chain of nearly 30 US companies. If true, then this is a,
[01:12:21.280 --> 01:12:26.240]   this is basically going to lead to huge numbers of companies having to rip and replace motherboards.
[01:12:26.240 --> 01:12:31.520]   If untrue, then two journalists have just ruined their professional careers. Twit. We read the
[01:12:31.520 --> 01:12:38.240]   tech news so you don't have to thank Ian Thompson and in that shell. Somebody's in trouble.
[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:46.000]   Don't know who but somebody is in trouble. Speaking of trouble, Microsoft also at this event and
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:52.400]   Daniel announced that they were as of last Tuesday going to make 1809 the new feature update,
[01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:57.120]   the fall feature update available. I present they did it was one of those things where you have to
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:13:01.440]   be a seeker to get it initially. I was a seeker. You go out to the windows update and you see if
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:09.040]   it's there and it is and I installed on my Surface studio on my Microsoft Surface Go. I installed on
[01:13:09.040 --> 01:13:14.080]   my Lenovo, no problems, no, everything went fine. Then Microsoft said, whoops.
[01:13:14.080 --> 01:13:21.840]   People are reporting data loss installing this update. One person on the Microsoft boards mentioned
[01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:30.000]   220 gigabytes in his documents folder gone. Oh, yeah. Gone. So Microsoft said, well, we're not
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:38.160]   going to push it out just yet. Yeah. What's going on? This, uh, Microsoft did not need this news. I
[01:13:38.160 --> 01:13:43.920]   mean, no company wants this news, but yeah, this is not good. I think it highlights some flaws in
[01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:52.320]   the insider program. Although yes, because didn't this wasn't this tested by millions of people?
[01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:58.160]   They've been tested in 1809 for six months. Yeah. And now, you know, to be fair, not I never
[01:13:58.160 --> 01:14:05.680]   experienced this problem. It was posted in the hub. Some users did have a problem with it. It
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:12.400]   wasn't upvoted and caught. Now, what usually happens is they have a ring in the insider program
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:19.040]   called release preview. And so two weeks before the final build goes out to the masses, it goes
[01:14:19.040 --> 01:14:24.320]   to release preview. That's the whole point of it. So it goes out to a wider, uh, cohort of testers.
[01:14:24.320 --> 01:14:29.600]   And they're supposed to catch last things. They didn't do that this time, which was weird.
[01:14:29.600 --> 01:14:34.640]   And to be fair, it was like, okay, well, this update doesn't seem too crazy anyway. There's not
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:40.400]   like a huge, there's a lot of honored hood stuff. They skipped the release preview. And now it's
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:43.920]   starting to look like it's coming back to bite them. Now, I don't think there's no evidence that
[01:14:43.920 --> 01:14:48.960]   this was the insider team making this decision. I don't think they make that call to be like,
[01:14:48.960 --> 01:14:53.600]   this is higher. This is the engineers. This is executives who are like, all right, the data
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:58.000]   is a car. Yeah, I don't think like Donna was like, I didn't make that call.
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:04.080]   No, she runs the insider program. Yeah. Yeah. But it's clear that the data missed things and
[01:15:05.040 --> 01:15:10.320]   well, listen, Microsoft's, and, you know, trying to do this huge, weird thing of building an operating
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:17.200]   system openly in the public, letting people test it and getting feedback. And it'll definitely be
[01:15:17.200 --> 01:15:21.920]   bumps in the road because no one's ever done it at this scale. Having said that,
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:26.880]   I think they clearly made some mistakes here. And I'm sure it just going to be some
[01:15:26.880 --> 01:15:31.120]   meetings and a lot of yelling to make sure something that doesn't happen.
[01:15:31.120 --> 01:15:36.320]   Most people didn't get it because it wasn't pushed yet. It probably would have been pushed
[01:15:36.320 --> 01:15:40.320]   Tuesday on patch Tuesday. Yeah. Did Rich, did you install it?
[01:15:40.320 --> 01:15:46.160]   I did not. No, but I am a smart man. Well, see, here's the thing, Leo. I learned my lesson
[01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:52.480]   about being a seeker. Because do you remember when the iPhone had the update that
[01:15:52.480 --> 01:15:56.880]   disabled? It's just totally screw up. So I'm the kind of guy when I hear there's an iPhone
[01:15:56.880 --> 01:16:01.360]   update, I'm pressing that button a million times to get it. Well, I did that and my phone was
[01:16:01.360 --> 01:16:06.480]   disabled for 24 hours because I had no cellular connection whatsoever. And so ever since then,
[01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:12.800]   yes, I'm a seeker, but a more of a casual, okay, I'll go like with Mojave. I, you know, I got it,
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:16.400]   you know, a week later, you know what I mean? And wait a little bit. Wait a little bit.
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:22.080]   That update, we were in the old studio and I had my literally had my finger poised over the
[01:16:22.080 --> 01:16:26.720]   update button. And I think it was Josh Windish or no, maybe it was Chad.
[01:16:26.720 --> 01:16:31.840]   Who was it? Jeff Needles. That's who it was. Came screaming down the hall saying,
[01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:36.800]   because it did him.
[01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:43.040]   Ever since then, I've been very cautious with updates and I love updates. I mean, to me,
[01:16:43.040 --> 01:16:47.600]   as a nerd, I always say an update is like Christmas. I love it. You're getting something new. It's a
[01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:52.800]   new feature. It's something new, no matter how small it is. But definitely like my wife,
[01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:58.960]   she doesn't, her iPhone, I think she just updated her watch to iOS or to watch OS five like yesterday.
[01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:06.080]   Smart, smart woman. So, you know, the old rule was wait, don't run the, don't do the first one.
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:11.520]   Don't do the second one. Do the third update that fixes the things that the second update broke
[01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:19.680]   on the first one. By then, it's probably. That's Alex Lindsay's rule.
[01:17:19.680 --> 01:17:25.760]   You're an IT. You just wait a year. Yeah. Well, yeah. At any major company, it's like, yeah,
[01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:31.360]   what are we going to get this? Ever, ever. How about you? You're not a window. You don't use
[01:17:31.360 --> 01:17:36.400]   windows, do you? Or no, you don't use windows. What is that thing behind you? That's not a Mac,
[01:17:36.400 --> 01:17:42.560]   that thing? This is all windows, baby. Yeah. But the thing is, I haven't really been into the
[01:17:42.560 --> 01:17:49.120]   whole beta release stuff for a long time because it was a release release. This wasn't a beta release.
[01:17:49.120 --> 01:17:56.720]   And then, but then I was going to say even now with running windows 10, a lot of the updates,
[01:17:56.720 --> 01:18:02.400]   I can't say I've noticed much because I spend most of my time in the apps. When I'm sitting at
[01:18:02.400 --> 01:18:07.040]   this rig, I'm sitting here with Premiere. I'm sitting with After Effects Lightroom.
[01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:12.080]   You might as well be on a Mac, frankly. And that's all I'm worried about. And every now and
[01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:18.560]   then, I get some annoying notification popping up about email or something like that. But for the
[01:18:18.560 --> 01:18:24.640]   most part, I don't even see windows. I just see whatever Adobe has in front of me or whatever the
[01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:32.320]   apps that I'm running at the time. So what is new in 1809 Daniel that I should be looking for?
[01:18:32.320 --> 01:18:37.440]   Because I agree with you, Ant. 1803 at least introduced the timeline, which I really like.
[01:18:37.440 --> 01:18:42.640]   I think that's pretty awesome. Yeah. Yeah. 1809 is not,
[01:18:42.640 --> 01:18:50.160]   depends what you consider cool for me. It's a, I use the snipping tool all the time.
[01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:56.320]   Yeah. I always, and they reworked that. So that is now a UWP app, but it's,
[01:18:56.320 --> 01:19:04.240]   it's much more powerful. You can just do the, was it Win, Shift S, and you can screen cap. It,
[01:19:04.240 --> 01:19:09.680]   it has a cloud clipboard. It can save it across devices, but you can also open it in a direct editor
[01:19:09.680 --> 01:19:14.400]   that allows inking directly so you can draw on it and then has a share feature so you can just
[01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:21.440]   send it off to email quickly. It's, it's snipping tool for the modern world, basically, for the new
[01:19:21.440 --> 01:19:27.840]   experiences that they're building. This is, this is a sign of our times by the way, when Mojave and
[01:19:27.840 --> 01:19:32.720]   the new windows update, the two biggest features are what you can do when you take a screenshot,
[01:19:32.720 --> 01:19:37.440]   because Mojave is kind of the same thing. It's like, I got it. And the first thing I noticed when I
[01:19:37.440 --> 01:19:41.520]   took a screenshot, I was like, Oh my gosh, I can mark it up on the screenshot. Amazing.
[01:19:42.720 --> 01:19:48.640]   The new phone book is here. The new phone book is here. So I, I finally gave up on dark mode.
[01:19:48.640 --> 01:19:52.640]   I feel bad because that was, that was the number one thing in Mojave.
[01:19:52.640 --> 01:19:57.520]   And I used it on all my Macs and I'm just, it's not, it's too dark.
[01:19:57.520 --> 01:20:02.240]   See, I'm still trying to, I'm still trying to use it because I, I'm like, this is what's new.
[01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:06.560]   This is what's new. I must use it. You gotta use it. Exactly. But I'm not in love with it.
[01:20:06.560 --> 01:20:10.880]   I'm not in love with it. I don't hate it, but I, I don't know, like I kind of want to switch back,
[01:20:10.880 --> 01:20:13.440]   but I'm not going to. I feel like I'm getting my money's worth it.
[01:20:13.440 --> 01:20:20.640]   It was free. I'm actually, the computer was not free. No, but the update was, so sorry.
[01:20:20.640 --> 01:20:27.280]   I actually disabled the Microsoft ink feature. When it was, when it was, oh yeah, yeah, I don't use it.
[01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:32.080]   It doesn't necessarily work well with the wake up devices that I've used. So I just turn that off.
[01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:37.760]   So that's, that's the only time I think about the actual windows operating system is as soon as my
[01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:42.640]   wake up starts wiggin out. I'm wondering, did that thing get re-enabled? So I have to go and dig
[01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:48.160]   forward and take that little box to turn it off. You know, I mean, this is a, this is a pad. I have a
[01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:53.520]   touch screen. I have a, I have a thing, but I know, you know, this windows ink workspace,
[01:20:53.520 --> 01:20:59.760]   what I've never used that. What is that? What? Huh? Come on, man. What do I want that for?
[01:20:59.760 --> 01:21:04.800]   So you're right. It's not, it's not the first thing I run to. I do like timeline, though, because
[01:21:04.800 --> 01:21:14.000]   that lets me go back through not only the applications I have open, but websites I've been to, you know,
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:19.440]   things I've, things I've looked at. And I really like that documents I've worked on. That is a
[01:21:19.440 --> 01:21:23.920]   very nice feature. Plus it exposes the desktop feature, which is really nice. And that works with
[01:21:23.920 --> 01:21:29.920]   Android now. If you use the Microsoft launcher, if you're part of 5.0 beta, which is really, really
[01:21:29.920 --> 01:21:36.640]   nice, you can now interview is like edge on Android and everything. It syncs up your Android history
[01:21:36.640 --> 01:21:42.720]   to timeline as well. Wow. So you get that cross. Yeah. And so you can view your PC history on your
[01:21:42.720 --> 01:21:47.040]   phone, which is really neat if you're working on a computer all day, running out for dinner,
[01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:51.200]   and why show someone that article. My favorite feature about timeline is search. You just type
[01:21:51.200 --> 01:21:55.040]   in a couple of key words and it goes back months and will figure out, oh, this is the article that
[01:21:55.040 --> 01:22:00.960]   you read it. That to me is really cool. There's a lot of stuff in 1809. It's just a lot of smaller
[01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:07.280]   things. Changes to edge, of course, there's a lot of changes that went on in there for some
[01:22:07.280 --> 01:22:12.480]   inking support, more changes in the way the menus look. Now there are sensitive. So if you use a mouse
[01:22:12.480 --> 01:22:19.280]   cursor, the menus are small and compact versus if you go to touch screen, they automatically are
[01:22:19.280 --> 01:22:24.240]   larger. So they're touch enabled. So there's just more refinements, I would say to the system.
[01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:29.680]   There just isn't like a huge feature. And so I think it's what everybody's looking for. But
[01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:33.440]   we're kind of at the stage now where we're just doing refinements plus they're working on the
[01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:38.480]   back end of the operating system to make for the next Windows Core OS basically.
[01:22:38.480 --> 01:22:45.760]   I think I open edge about twice a year. Trying to add for the Apple events.
[01:22:45.760 --> 01:22:51.440]   I, you know what? I'm using it. I use it a lot now. I even use it on my Android device. That is
[01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:55.840]   saying something. Wow. Yeah. I always feel so bad opening up edge and then downloading Chrome.
[01:22:55.840 --> 01:23:02.560]   Well, the really annoying thing is every time you use edge to do anything in Google land,
[01:23:02.560 --> 01:23:07.840]   Google would say, would you like to use a safe browser instead? I find it's so kind of setting
[01:23:07.840 --> 01:23:13.920]   and so annoying. And I just, I wish they'd stop. No, I'm using edge. I'm fine. Thanks.
[01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:21.280]   Mom, I use edge on iOS. So cool. No, come on. Oh, man. That's not a crazy talk. That's really
[01:23:21.280 --> 01:23:27.280]   get dark mode. I mean, it's got to add a block of open dark mode. So Tuesday we will hear.
[01:23:27.280 --> 01:23:32.800]   I know I can't think of a single product announcement that has been more leaked.
[01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:39.040]   Ever. Yes. Samsung does a terrible job of keeping this stuff quiet too. But we know more about the
[01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:47.600]   Pixel three. Then it's ridiculous. Now you had an interesting theory. You think that Google's
[01:23:47.600 --> 01:23:54.400]   leaking this stuff. Yeah. And I can't necessarily say I follow that logic, but there's no way a
[01:23:54.400 --> 01:24:02.880]   company as large as Google or alphabet or whatever you call them these days has this much of a
[01:24:02.880 --> 01:24:08.560]   security problem. As far as things just that are internal, just leaking out on a regular,
[01:24:08.560 --> 01:24:14.080]   it's almost like a regular basis now. I'm waiting for the next notification to pop up on my phone
[01:24:14.080 --> 01:24:20.400]   in the hour that says, here's another view. I woke up this morning and I get you the plot one.
[01:24:20.400 --> 01:24:26.480]   You know, what is what sense is that? I don't get it. So I'm assuming that PR
[01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:31.920]   figured, you know what, let's try to, you know, put a little more buzz out there before the show.
[01:24:31.920 --> 01:24:38.080]   Is that to dampen iPhone sales? I mean, what's the price? I don't think so. No, they can't help.
[01:24:38.080 --> 01:24:42.160]   I mean, they sold four million of these pixels last year. That's not even a blip on the radar for
[01:24:42.160 --> 01:24:47.280]   the average person. So it doesn't, all the PR in the world does not matter. I mean, people,
[01:24:47.280 --> 01:24:52.720]   they don't even understand what a pixel is. And so I don't think that that's it. I think it
[01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:59.120]   really comes down to, you know, there are in the works before launch, there's, you know, they have
[01:24:59.120 --> 01:25:03.760]   to make documents, they have to make review documents, they have to get the product to places, they
[01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:08.320]   have to give, they give briefings to certain reporters on things. And those are all points of
[01:25:08.320 --> 01:25:13.040]   failure that could potentially happen. And I think that's what we're seeing here. Getting the phone
[01:25:13.040 --> 01:25:17.440]   a couple weeks early, I mean, look, it was one shop in Hong Kong. I mean, we've seen Best Buy
[01:25:17.440 --> 01:25:23.680]   Sell, they sold the Chromecast early, you know, the new one. So it's just, there's a lot, you know,
[01:25:23.680 --> 01:25:27.600]   in this world that we live in, if you're launching products kind of day in date, like right after
[01:25:27.600 --> 01:25:32.640]   the announcement, there's a lot bigger chance for things to happen. And even with Apple, we see
[01:25:32.640 --> 01:25:37.920]   this stuff happening. And they have the best PR in the business. Fair enough. Things like Apple
[01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:45.520]   is really a lot more locked down when it comes to what is being shared to the public and the
[01:25:45.520 --> 01:25:48.880]   masses. Yeah, it doesn't get leaked out. Another purchase is the supply chain.
[01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:54.320]   Right. I don't, but they do get a lot of leaks. They do get leaks once it was trying to actually,
[01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:58.560]   I think they kind of put more of the leaks out there than Google would, you know, Google, it's like,
[01:25:58.560 --> 01:26:04.480]   they would, I don't know, I feel like the Pixel is such not an issue for like most people, you know,
[01:26:04.480 --> 01:26:08.480]   it's like, it's like my mom is sitting there like excited about the new Pixel, although she is,
[01:26:08.480 --> 01:26:13.520]   because she has one. So I made her get one. Okay. Okay. So she actually is, but my point is,
[01:26:13.520 --> 01:26:17.760]   even as a Pixel user, she doesn't even really understand like what makes the next one better.
[01:26:17.760 --> 01:26:20.960]   So for the average person, like, I think they'd be more interested in what's, you know, the new
[01:26:20.960 --> 01:26:26.400]   iPhone, obviously iPhone rumors are huge Samsung and it's so to a lesser extent.
[01:26:26.400 --> 01:26:31.840]   But those are big as well. So I don't know. I just think there's, it's just Google the way.
[01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:36.160]   I don't know. They're the ones that own the search engine and they're getting the stuff leak.
[01:26:36.160 --> 01:26:42.960]   So I'm probably the one pixel person that's had both the original pixel and pixel two.
[01:26:42.960 --> 01:26:46.240]   Oh, I've had a lot of it right here. I have a crap about pixel three.
[01:26:46.240 --> 01:26:51.520]   I love the pixel. The only reason I want the pixel three is for the speed because the two
[01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:57.440]   has slowed down to me. Has it really? That's always the knock on androids as they get slower over time.
[01:26:57.440 --> 01:27:03.360]   There was a, I don't know, when you, when, if you did the first update to nine, it was like,
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:07.120]   it was really bad. And then it came back, you know, it like it actually did.
[01:27:07.120 --> 01:27:13.760]   I have a pixel two XL and I'm very happy with it. And I haven't noticed the speed drop.
[01:27:13.760 --> 01:27:20.000]   And one of the reasons I pull it out a lot is the camera. And many agree that even with the iPhone
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:25.840]   10S, tennis, Max say it right now. See it right. Even with the iPhone tennis,
[01:27:25.840 --> 01:27:31.520]   that this phone has a better camera, even though it's a year old now. So I'm, I tell you what,
[01:27:31.520 --> 01:27:34.880]   I'm going to be paying attention to on Tuesday and I'm going to be here eight in the morning.
[01:27:34.880 --> 01:27:39.040]   With the live star life, man. That's a hard life.
[01:27:39.040 --> 01:27:46.000]   Made in the morning. I look at, and I'm an old man. I've arranged my life so I don't have to
[01:27:46.000 --> 01:27:53.120]   show up till 11 every morning. Hey, I salute you. Mr. I only work four days a week to make me
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:58.880]   coming in the morning. That's on human. So you're flying in New York for this rich tomorrow.
[01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:03.760]   You're my, there you go. Your mic fell out. Oh, yeah. Sorry. Mike. Yeah. So, okay, I'll tell you
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:07.360]   what I'll be looking for. And you could tell, you can, you can look for it for me. How, what's the
[01:28:07.360 --> 01:28:11.280]   cameras? It knew is it different? Is it better? Apparently, according to the, the, the phone that
[01:28:11.280 --> 01:28:19.280]   was sold in Hong Kong, it's 13, it's the 13.2 pixels or something. It's not the 12 megapixel.
[01:28:19.280 --> 01:28:25.440]   Oh, they added a megapixel? They added them. Yeah. Let's see. What is it's a 12.
[01:28:25.440 --> 01:28:33.760]   Oh, I'm sorry. Engadget says it's 12.2 megapixel main camera pair of a pair, two eight megapixel
[01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:40.960]   front facing cameras. So it has the wide selfie. Yeah, pretty Excel. Yeah. It's a 6.3 inch screen
[01:28:40.960 --> 01:28:47.200]   quilt, Qualcomm eight 45 chipset. The one that he bought in Hong Kong. This is in gadget at
[01:28:47.200 --> 01:28:53.760]   a Richard Lai says it only had four gigs of RAM. Yeah. That's a little lightweight, but
[01:28:53.760 --> 01:29:00.000]   there may be other models. Remember, he just got one. It does have a notch, which is so disappointing.
[01:29:00.800 --> 01:29:06.720]   I don't care about that notch. Yeah, I don't care. I mean, I'm fine with the notch.
[01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:10.400]   Well, it doesn't bother me on an iPhone. I understand why the idea is you don't want any
[01:29:10.400 --> 01:29:15.360]   bezels. So you have to have something so that you could put cameras there. It's the chin. It's
[01:29:15.360 --> 01:29:19.520]   a combo boat. That's the problem. They still have a chin. It's not like they got rid of the chin.
[01:29:19.520 --> 01:29:24.880]   Yeah, I have a beef with the chin. If you want to cut something down, cut that away a little bit.
[01:29:24.880 --> 01:29:29.440]   Yeah, I just a little bit because I don't mind bezels to understand.
[01:29:30.320 --> 01:29:36.320]   I mean, there's we don't understand the manufacturing vicissitudes, the exigencies.
[01:29:36.320 --> 01:29:41.200]   You know, there may be reasons you have to have some. You can't have a screen go all the way down
[01:29:41.200 --> 01:29:46.480]   there. They also took out the headphone jack last year and it bothers the hell out of me.
[01:29:46.480 --> 01:29:53.120]   But see, the fact that they're including the USB-C headphones now, I think is huge because that
[01:29:53.120 --> 01:29:58.320]   was a big sore point for me, even though I use Bluetooth headphones, but I still sometimes just
[01:29:58.320 --> 01:30:02.880]   like to have something. Let's say you're doing a Skype call and you want to just plug into your
[01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:06.960]   phone. You know, it's like or listening to music or your batteries are dead. And the fact that you
[01:30:06.960 --> 01:30:13.840]   can't find a decent pair of USB-C cheap kind of headphones on anywhere, this is big to me. So the
[01:30:13.840 --> 01:30:19.280]   fact that they're in the box, I think, is very nice. Otherwise, this phone seems so unexciting.
[01:30:19.280 --> 01:30:24.240]   I mean, I love the Pixel. Believe me, I think it's my favorite phone out of almost every device
[01:30:24.240 --> 01:30:30.000]   out there due to the camera. But I don't see this as being any sort of, there's nothing they're
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:34.080]   adding to this as far as I can tell that makes this any better than the iPhone. The iPhone is
[01:30:34.080 --> 01:30:38.960]   still a better creator device, you know, where you can record videos and stuff like that that,
[01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:43.200]   you know, and edit stuff on it. This is just a great camera. It's like a one trick pony once
[01:30:43.200 --> 01:30:47.440]   again. So, I don't know. Well, but it's also, and I always say this, is that if you're going to get
[01:30:47.440 --> 01:30:50.960]   an Android phone, get it from Google, at least you know you'll get the updates. You'll be
[01:30:50.960 --> 01:30:58.800]   secure, relatively secure. That's the big challenge for me with Android. I love Android, but it's
[01:30:58.800 --> 01:31:04.160]   a dangerous, it feels like it's dangerous to use an Android phone compared to an iPhone.
[01:31:04.160 --> 01:31:10.480]   But I like the flexibility. I like widgets. I like, I just think, you know, Android is a better
[01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:14.560]   operating system if they could just gosh, the other thing that Google does that Apple stops
[01:31:14.560 --> 01:31:20.880]   doing is Apple stop putting a headphone adapter in the box. Google is going to have a USB C to
[01:31:20.880 --> 01:31:27.840]   3.5 millimeter dongle. You know, a wireless charging too. That's that's a good oh, wireless
[01:31:27.840 --> 01:31:34.160]   will be nice because that the current piece of it does not have that. I have the pixel too. It's
[01:31:34.160 --> 01:31:39.680]   it's a fine phone, but I find it extremely boring. And besides taking good photos,
[01:31:40.240 --> 01:31:45.280]   I just got really bored with it. And that's not even a negative in the sense that I feel like this
[01:31:45.280 --> 01:31:51.120]   is just like what we're talking about, pixel three, the industry, the technology has stabilized,
[01:31:51.120 --> 01:31:57.200]   it's plateaued. And so the return. Yeah, so each year it's like, you know, this year with the
[01:31:57.200 --> 01:32:01.840]   iPhone and it's it's not bad. It's just that means it's like how I don't get that excited
[01:32:01.840 --> 01:32:06.400]   over new TVs or a new refrigerator. You know, 20 years ago, my refrigerator would have been
[01:32:06.400 --> 01:32:13.520]   rocket science. It makes ice. Right. But now it's like, okay, it's amazing. It's like this with
[01:32:13.520 --> 01:32:18.960]   phones now. And I feel kind of bad ripping on like the pixel three because it's it's I'm sure it's
[01:32:18.960 --> 01:32:24.160]   a fine phone. It's just it's hard to get blown away by this. I'm like wireless charging. Okay, I
[01:32:24.160 --> 01:32:35.280]   had in 2012 with my Lumia party. I mean, that's the challenge like for me, like, you know,
[01:32:35.920 --> 01:32:40.560]   for doing a story for, you know, mass America the way I am on the news. Yeah, it's like,
[01:32:40.560 --> 01:32:45.040]   well, how do I even say like, like, literally, I will have this phone in hand on Tuesday.
[01:32:45.040 --> 01:32:49.040]   And it's like, how do I say what's new about this thing? I mean, you have wireless charging
[01:32:49.040 --> 01:32:53.600]   and the camera is just as good. Except now you can take a white selfie. I mean, that's really
[01:32:53.600 --> 01:32:58.080]   that's a really well, okay. All right, I'm going to try to help you here.
[01:32:58.080 --> 01:33:04.000]   Thank God. I don't have to do this anymore, but I'll try to help you. So one thing that means it's
[01:33:04.000 --> 01:33:07.920]   no longer a metal back. If you're going to have wireless charging, they're going to have eliminated
[01:33:07.920 --> 01:33:12.640]   the metal back. So that's interesting. It's a new here's more what it can break more now.
[01:33:12.640 --> 01:33:16.320]   Yeah, so it's more more more more. That's actually important. Yeah.
[01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:21.840]   I here was a big thing. People have seemed to have forgotten. But when the pixel two came out,
[01:33:21.840 --> 01:33:27.440]   the XL, especially people were saying this OLED screen is awful. It's got burn in. Remember that?
[01:33:27.440 --> 01:33:33.680]   Yeah, for weeks, people were. Yeah. And it isn't a lot of faith. It's not a great screen.
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:38.480]   No. So I'll be interested if Google's fixed that problem because they, you know, I think it was a
[01:33:38.480 --> 01:33:44.400]   supply issue that Apple and Samsung had all the OLED screens and Google got what was left over.
[01:33:44.400 --> 01:33:49.600]   Maybe they've solved that problem. So I'll be curious to see. And you know, my test on the screen
[01:33:49.600 --> 01:33:57.520]   is with scrolling. If you scroll on the on the pixel two, it just it can't handle it.
[01:33:57.520 --> 01:34:02.880]   It's the colors get distorted in weird ways and stuff. It's just not a great screen.
[01:34:02.880 --> 01:34:09.040]   So I'm hoping that will be fixed. I do believe Google has the best camera technology. I don't
[01:34:09.040 --> 01:34:15.760]   know how you explain to mom and pop America, but how computational photography is changing.
[01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:23.440]   The only way to explain it is to take the Samsung approach and make it all about that dual
[01:34:23.440 --> 01:34:29.040]   selfie camera because that's the stuff that sells. Yeah. It is much as I was doing that too
[01:34:29.040 --> 01:34:32.800]   with the portrait mode. I mean, they finally have a slider in there that can change their
[01:34:32.800 --> 01:34:36.000]   background. That's pretty hard to explain though why that's a good thing.
[01:34:36.000 --> 01:34:43.040]   Even even saying the word bokeh is, you know, it's like, I mean, I love, I always say it's a blurry
[01:34:43.040 --> 01:34:48.320]   background because I do love that. I love that. I love that. But it's, yeah, I mean, it's just,
[01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:51.760]   you know, it's one of those things where do you buy a phone based on the fact that it does that.
[01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:56.480]   And I guess Apple has proven that they've gotten that feature because Samsung had that feature
[01:34:56.480 --> 01:35:00.240]   for a while, right? Oh, yeah. Oh, you had the slider forever. Yeah.
[01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:04.080]   Right. Once Apple did it, it was like the same thing with wireless charging. It's been on Samsung
[01:35:04.080 --> 01:35:08.400]   phones that's going back. I can't even remember how long a while. And as soon as Apple did it,
[01:35:08.400 --> 01:35:12.560]   it became exciting. You know, it's like now we've got, and wireless is everywhere. And the same
[01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:16.480]   thing with Apple Pay. You know, it's like you've got once Apple Pay came into play,
[01:35:16.480 --> 01:35:21.200]   everyone is now talking about mobile payments when, you know, you had Samsung Pay, you had
[01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:25.680]   Google Pay, I feel like was around even before Apple Pay.
[01:35:25.680 --> 01:35:30.560]   Here's where your audience is going to be so excited. The new Pixel charging stand.
[01:35:30.560 --> 01:35:36.080]   I'm excited about this person. I actually want that.
[01:35:36.080 --> 01:35:36.400]   Yes.
[01:35:36.400 --> 01:35:40.160]   Because think about it. Now you can have this on your bedside table.
[01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:43.760]   You know, we have one. I've had one for years until.
[01:35:43.760 --> 01:35:45.440]   Well, it's so why, but it plugs in.
[01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:48.080]   No, I have a wireless.
[01:35:48.080 --> 01:35:48.640]   Easy. Oh, yeah.
[01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:51.200]   I charge all my wireless phones on the Samsung.
[01:35:51.200 --> 01:35:51.840]   Not your Pixel 2.
[01:35:51.840 --> 01:35:53.200]   The iPhone, but not the Pixel 2.
[01:35:53.200 --> 01:35:54.640]   Don't keep your phone by your bed.
[01:35:54.640 --> 01:35:57.680]   That's even the better choice. And just get a good night's sleep.
[01:35:57.680 --> 01:35:59.040]   Are you one of those people?
[01:35:59.040 --> 01:35:59.840]   Wait a minute.
[01:35:59.840 --> 01:36:02.480]   You lock all your hardware up when you go to bed.
[01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:06.720]   So just confession. I was actually a sleep technician for many years in New York City,
[01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:07.920]   a while Cornell Medical School.
[01:36:07.920 --> 01:36:08.400]   What?
[01:36:08.400 --> 01:36:10.320]   And so I used that's what I did for a living.
[01:36:10.320 --> 01:36:10.880]   You're asleep.
[01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:11.360]   I know I'm asleep.
[01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:15.040]   And so I don't keep any technology in my bedroom.
[01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:16.480]   No TV.
[01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:17.120]   Okay.
[01:36:17.120 --> 01:36:20.320]   This whole blue light thing though, that's completely a scam, right?
[01:36:20.320 --> 01:36:22.400]   No, that's 100% accurate.
[01:36:24.000 --> 01:36:26.880]   I don't sleep any way. I think I would have done it like once a month.
[01:36:26.880 --> 01:36:27.920]   So I don't really matter.
[01:36:27.920 --> 01:36:29.920]   I will say the...
[01:36:29.920 --> 01:36:32.400]   I've been up since 4am today if that helps.
[01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:33.600]   Oh, yeah.
[01:36:33.600 --> 01:36:35.680]   I sleep like crap. It's really the problem.
[01:36:35.680 --> 01:36:36.080]   That's why.
[01:36:36.080 --> 01:36:40.800]   The iOS feature, the bedtime thing, is nice.
[01:36:40.800 --> 01:36:43.680]   Where you kind of wake up and you want to look at your phone
[01:36:43.680 --> 01:36:46.160]   and it's all dark and it doesn't show your notifications.
[01:36:46.160 --> 01:36:47.120]   I really do like that.
[01:36:47.120 --> 01:36:48.960]   And Pixel is doing the same thing.
[01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:51.520]   They don't... If it's on Do Not Disturb now,
[01:36:51.520 --> 01:36:52.800]   it doesn't show your notifications.
[01:36:52.800 --> 01:36:54.800]   So I like that.
[01:36:54.800 --> 01:36:58.000]   I think that's smart because we have to protect ourselves from ourselves.
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:36:58.080]   Yes.
[01:36:58.080 --> 01:36:58.560]   Mental health.
[01:36:58.560 --> 01:37:02.320]   But I think I've gotten to the point where I have started protecting myself
[01:37:02.320 --> 01:37:06.560]   because if I might sleep at the most about 4 hours a night.
[01:37:06.560 --> 01:37:09.520]   Oh, you got to talk to him about this guy Daniel.
[01:37:09.520 --> 01:37:10.640]   He's a trained professor.
[01:37:10.640 --> 01:37:11.120]   Yeah.
[01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:12.000]   That's not healthy.
[01:37:12.000 --> 01:37:13.360]   So let me just ask you Daniel,
[01:37:13.360 --> 01:37:15.920]   having spent all this time with the Cornell Sleep Center,
[01:37:15.920 --> 01:37:17.120]   do you sleep really well?
[01:37:17.120 --> 01:37:18.320]   I do.
[01:37:18.320 --> 01:37:19.120]   I'll show up.
[01:37:19.120 --> 01:37:21.200]   I post this at times because I use a Fitbit.
[01:37:21.200 --> 01:37:24.640]   And Fitbit has hands-on the best sleep tracking tech.
[01:37:24.640 --> 01:37:26.560]   That's not in the hospital, in my opinion.
[01:37:26.560 --> 01:37:28.400]   Bio is in a nice sleep.
[01:37:28.400 --> 01:37:28.880]   You got to get this.
[01:37:28.880 --> 01:37:31.360]   You got... I'm going to get you one of these.
[01:37:31.360 --> 01:37:32.720]   This is the Oreo ring.
[01:37:32.720 --> 01:37:33.280]   Oh, you are.
[01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:33.760]   Oh, you are.
[01:37:33.760 --> 01:37:34.320]   All right.
[01:37:34.320 --> 01:37:37.520]   This does temperature as well and because it's on your finger,
[01:37:37.520 --> 01:37:39.200]   it's got the two arteries here.
[01:37:39.200 --> 01:37:40.800]   I think this is the best sleep tracker.
[01:37:40.800 --> 01:37:41.280]   And I used...
[01:37:41.280 --> 01:37:44.560]   I've been using the Cerro one that's under your mattress.
[01:37:44.560 --> 01:37:45.760]   I've got an Apple watch.
[01:37:45.760 --> 01:37:46.800]   I've tried all of it.
[01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:49.120]   But the problem is I don't want to wear a bracelet.
[01:37:49.120 --> 01:37:50.640]   I don't want to wear a Fitbit or anyone.
[01:37:50.640 --> 01:37:51.920]   This thing... I don't mind...
[01:37:51.920 --> 01:37:52.560]   It's not...
[01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:55.440]   I mean, I'd like to not wear a ring to bed, but I do.
[01:37:55.440 --> 01:37:56.720]   And it gives me great...
[01:37:56.720 --> 01:37:57.360]   We had a...
[01:37:57.360 --> 01:37:58.800]   If you want to find out more, there was a...
[01:37:58.800 --> 01:38:03.280]   We had the CEO on yesterday on the new screen savers.
[01:38:03.280 --> 01:38:04.880]   But I've been wearing this for a month.
[01:38:04.880 --> 01:38:05.840]   And I would love...
[01:38:05.840 --> 01:38:09.360]   Kevin Rose told me about this is the O-U-R-A ring.com.
[01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:10.880]   I'll definitely check that out.
[01:38:10.880 --> 01:38:11.360]   Yeah.
[01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:13.280]   That's where a lot of this technology is going into.
[01:38:13.280 --> 01:38:14.880]   It's interesting stuff.
[01:38:14.880 --> 01:38:15.920]   It helps people...
[01:38:15.920 --> 01:38:17.360]   I mean, what Apple's doing,
[01:38:17.360 --> 01:38:18.080]   what Fitbit's doing.
[01:38:18.080 --> 01:38:19.360]   They're about to launch their new...
[01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:20.960]   The...
[01:38:20.960 --> 01:38:21.920]   The Detect Sleep App.
[01:38:21.920 --> 01:38:22.480]   Yeah, basically.
[01:38:22.480 --> 01:38:24.160]   You pause as a breathing while you're sleeping.
[01:38:24.160 --> 01:38:24.720]   Yes.
[01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:25.200]   Huge.
[01:38:25.200 --> 01:38:26.240]   They're huge.
[01:38:26.240 --> 01:38:26.720]   Yes.
[01:38:26.720 --> 01:38:28.240]   But do you have to wear your Apple Watch?
[01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:31.680]   Well, so the Apple Watch is going to detect AFib,
[01:38:31.680 --> 01:38:33.120]   which is significant.
[01:38:33.120 --> 01:38:33.600]   Yeah.
[01:38:33.600 --> 01:38:36.320]   The AFib affects between two and six million people in the U.S.
[01:38:36.320 --> 01:38:38.960]   So you have to wear the Apple face mask then for the...
[01:38:38.960 --> 01:38:39.200]   Yeah.
[01:38:39.200 --> 01:38:39.440]   Right.
[01:38:39.440 --> 01:38:39.920]   Yeah.
[01:38:39.920 --> 01:38:42.640]   But the Fitbit with Sleep App.
[01:38:42.640 --> 01:38:42.880]   Yeah.
[01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:45.440]   Appina is between 20 and 30 million people.
[01:38:45.440 --> 01:38:45.920]   Oh, it's a huge one.
[01:38:45.920 --> 01:38:46.480]   And if you get...
[01:38:46.480 --> 01:38:46.880]   Yeah, that's huge.
[01:38:46.880 --> 01:38:47.680]   If we get back up to Sleep App,
[01:38:47.680 --> 01:38:48.160]   Yeah.
[01:38:48.160 --> 01:38:49.840]   We automatically check for AFib.
[01:38:49.840 --> 01:38:50.640]   So you get...
[01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:52.720]   I find the Fitbit system better than...
[01:38:52.720 --> 01:38:54.320]   How could a Detect Sleep App near?
[01:38:54.320 --> 01:38:56.720]   Has an SPO2 sensor in it.
[01:38:56.720 --> 01:38:56.800]   Oh, no.
[01:38:56.800 --> 01:38:58.800]   So they actually can detect your oxygen level.
[01:38:58.800 --> 01:39:02.240]   And they calibrate it along with your heart rate and everything.
[01:39:02.240 --> 01:39:02.800]   That's interesting.
[01:39:02.800 --> 01:39:03.840]   And usually in algorithm.
[01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:04.080]   Yeah.
[01:39:04.080 --> 01:39:05.040]   Which one has this?
[01:39:05.040 --> 01:39:05.520]   I missed it.
[01:39:05.520 --> 01:39:07.040]   Which one has the O2?
[01:39:07.040 --> 01:39:08.640]   Versa has it, Ionic.
[01:39:08.640 --> 01:39:10.960]   And I think that's it for right now.
[01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:11.680]   So the Versa...
[01:39:11.680 --> 01:39:12.400]   I didn't realize that.
[01:39:12.400 --> 01:39:12.800]   So it...
[01:39:12.800 --> 01:39:13.120]   Okay.
[01:39:13.120 --> 01:39:13.360]   I...
[01:39:13.360 --> 01:39:13.680]   Just not on.
[01:39:13.680 --> 01:39:14.640]   Because I wore that for a long time.
[01:39:14.640 --> 01:39:15.200]   Yeah.
[01:39:15.200 --> 01:39:15.760]   It was on...
[01:39:15.760 --> 01:39:17.040]   It was on November and beta.
[01:39:17.040 --> 01:39:18.160]   Oh, okay.
[01:39:18.160 --> 01:39:19.360]   It's not out yet.
[01:39:19.360 --> 01:39:20.240]   Oh, wow.
[01:39:20.240 --> 01:39:20.560]   That's...
[01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:21.840]   So it's gonna turn...
[01:39:21.840 --> 01:39:25.440]   They're gonna turn on the feature inside existing devices.
[01:39:25.440 --> 01:39:25.760]   Exactly.
[01:39:25.760 --> 01:39:26.480]   Oh, that's big.
[01:39:26.480 --> 01:39:27.360]   That's really big.
[01:39:27.360 --> 01:39:27.600]   Yeah.
[01:39:27.600 --> 01:39:28.960]   Very nice.
[01:39:28.960 --> 01:39:31.680]   I didn't know you were a sleep technician.
[01:39:31.680 --> 01:39:32.240]   That's awesome.
[01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:33.040]   Yeah.
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:34.080]   It grows a great job.
[01:39:34.080 --> 01:39:35.760]   I got so many questions for you.
[01:39:35.760 --> 01:39:37.200]   See, don't you think it's funny...
[01:39:37.200 --> 01:39:39.360]   Don't you think it's funny that Apple is not talking about...
[01:39:39.360 --> 01:39:43.520]   Because Apple is all about fitness and health with the watch right now.
[01:39:43.520 --> 01:39:45.840]   But they have not mentioned a word about sleep.
[01:39:45.840 --> 01:39:47.600]   Because the Apple watch can't do that.
[01:39:47.600 --> 01:39:49.040]   I mean, it can with third-party apps.
[01:39:49.520 --> 01:39:51.040]   But that's the question.
[01:39:51.040 --> 01:39:54.320]   In fact, we were talking about that yesterday with the CEO of Aura.
[01:39:54.320 --> 01:39:59.280]   He's actually breathing a sigh of relief that Apple hasn't released an app for sleep on your watch.
[01:39:59.280 --> 01:39:59.760]   Sure.
[01:39:59.760 --> 01:40:00.000]   Because...
[01:40:00.000 --> 01:40:02.160]   They would do a good job.
[01:40:02.160 --> 01:40:03.600]   Yeah, why haven't they?
[01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:04.000]   They will.
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:05.680]   They will when they get the battery up.
[01:40:05.680 --> 01:40:06.240]   They can't...
[01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:06.640]   Yeah.
[01:40:06.640 --> 01:40:08.880]   They don't want to be able to charge it overnight.
[01:40:08.880 --> 01:40:09.280]   Yeah.
[01:40:09.280 --> 01:40:09.920]   Exactly.
[01:40:09.920 --> 01:40:11.760]   And they don't want to bring that problem to the forefront.
[01:40:11.760 --> 01:40:15.440]   Because right now your Apple watch is just fine if you're wearing it throughout the day.
[01:40:15.440 --> 01:40:15.520]   Right.
[01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:18.800]   But like with the Fitbit, one of the things I love about the Versa is that I literally...
[01:40:18.800 --> 01:40:20.160]   You know, it's four...
[01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:21.680]   Every four days you charge it.
[01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:23.440]   And so you can use it as a sleep.
[01:40:23.440 --> 01:40:26.480]   But one night a week you don't get the sleep, you know.
[01:40:26.480 --> 01:40:28.480]   Or you just charge it while you take a shower or whatever.
[01:40:28.480 --> 01:40:28.960]   Right.
[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:30.000]   But it's...
[01:40:30.000 --> 01:40:33.440]   Apple doesn't want to bring any of this to the conversation right now until they're ready.
[01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:34.240]   That makes sense.
[01:40:34.240 --> 01:40:34.480]   Yeah.
[01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:36.560]   That makes a lot of sense.
[01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:43.760]   Also expected on Tuesday a screen with the Google Assistant.
[01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:45.520]   They call it the Google Home Hub.
[01:40:46.240 --> 01:40:51.760]   Lenovo, JBL, and others have already done Google Homes with built-in screens.
[01:40:51.760 --> 01:40:54.560]   This will be the first one from Google.
[01:40:54.560 --> 01:40:59.040]   This is a leaked mock-up or a leaked image or I don't know.
[01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:02.480]   I people have used the Lenovo like it.
[01:41:02.480 --> 01:41:03.680]   We I think we reviewed the Lenovo.
[01:41:03.680 --> 01:41:04.160]   It's huge.
[01:41:04.160 --> 01:41:04.640]   Yeah.
[01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:05.200]   Yeah.
[01:41:05.200 --> 01:41:08.560]   When you add a screen, I have the Amazon Echo show.
[01:41:08.560 --> 01:41:09.600]   I love the show.
[01:41:09.600 --> 01:41:09.920]   Yeah.
[01:41:09.920 --> 01:41:10.160]   Yeah.
[01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:14.320]   As soon as you add a screen to that device, it changes it so dynamically.
[01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:18.000]   The ability to call up my ring, my front doorbell and get a live feed is...
[01:41:18.000 --> 01:41:18.960]   I love that.
[01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:23.680]   Like, and plus that's just how we work because talking to a computer is still weird.
[01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:27.360]   But when you get that visual feedback and you get to see the weather forecast,
[01:41:27.360 --> 01:41:29.840]   everything clicks a little bit more and it's memorizing everything.
[01:41:29.840 --> 01:41:31.200]   It's being spoken back to you.
[01:41:31.200 --> 01:41:32.160]   We will...
[01:41:32.160 --> 01:41:35.200]   And this will have YouTube versus the show, which I brought.
[01:41:35.200 --> 01:41:36.640]   Doesn't the show not have YouTube?
[01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:40.480]   They had YouTube, then they kicked YouTube off, then YouTube came back,
[01:41:40.480 --> 01:41:41.760]   then it's I think it's gone again.
[01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:42.480]   I can't remember.
[01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:43.520]   It's okay.
[01:41:43.520 --> 01:41:44.320]   It's...
[01:41:44.320 --> 01:41:44.800]   Yeah.
[01:41:44.800 --> 01:41:47.600]   Amazon and Google don't seem to like each other too much.
[01:41:47.600 --> 01:41:48.160]   No.
[01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:48.960]   For some show.
[01:41:48.960 --> 01:41:53.680]   But again, this is another device that's pushing us into that Google or you have to choose.
[01:41:53.680 --> 01:41:54.080]   Do you want to be...
[01:41:54.080 --> 01:41:54.640]   It's a silo.
[01:41:54.640 --> 01:41:55.120]   That's right.
[01:41:55.120 --> 01:41:55.920]   It's a silo.
[01:41:55.920 --> 01:42:00.400]   And this is pushing us because you know that this is going to work with Nest.
[01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:00.480]   Right.
[01:42:00.480 --> 01:42:02.960]   But probably not with the ring, I'm guessing.
[01:42:02.960 --> 01:42:04.400]   Oh, it'll work with the ring.
[01:42:04.400 --> 01:42:04.960]   Because Amazon...
[01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:05.520]   Think so?
[01:42:05.520 --> 01:42:07.520]   Well, Amazon bought ring.
[01:42:07.520 --> 01:42:07.920]   No.
[01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:08.400]   Yep.
[01:42:08.400 --> 01:42:09.280]   Oh, Amazon did.
[01:42:09.280 --> 01:42:10.720]   But Google isn't...
[01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:12.320]   They probably don't like ring.
[01:42:12.320 --> 01:42:13.120]   Well, I don't know.
[01:42:13.120 --> 01:42:13.840]   That's interesting.
[01:42:13.840 --> 01:42:14.800]   This...
[01:42:14.800 --> 01:42:16.800]   The show works with our Nest, doesn't it?
[01:42:16.800 --> 01:42:17.520]   I think it does.
[01:42:17.520 --> 01:42:19.120]   Oh, it's so good.
[01:42:19.120 --> 01:42:19.600]   You're right.
[01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:20.240]   That's the problem.
[01:42:20.240 --> 01:42:21.280]   And consumers go,
[01:42:21.280 --> 01:42:21.920]   "Oh, screw it.
[01:42:21.920 --> 01:42:25.280]   I'm going to buy the Amazon thing and all the things that Amazon makes."
[01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:27.760]   Or, "I'm going to buy the Google thing and all the thing Google makes."
[01:42:27.760 --> 01:42:28.960]   They're not going to spend the time saying,
[01:42:28.960 --> 01:42:31.360]   "Well, will the Nest work with the Echo?"
[01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:32.480]   They're not going to bother.
[01:42:32.480 --> 01:42:33.200]   Yeah.
[01:42:33.200 --> 01:42:34.640]   And then there's Apple.
[01:42:34.640 --> 01:42:40.640]   There's also going to be a new Chrome tablet,
[01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:42.000]   the Pixel Slate.
[01:42:42.000 --> 01:42:43.040]   Man, there's nothing.
[01:42:43.040 --> 01:42:46.240]   I'm going to get up at 8am and I'm just going to be...
[01:42:46.240 --> 01:42:48.560]   I could just be reading this article from The Verge.
[01:42:48.560 --> 01:42:52.160]   It was a few early on.
[01:42:52.160 --> 01:42:53.520]   It's actually the least.
[01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:55.840]   As I was going to say, there was an early on,
[01:42:55.840 --> 01:43:00.720]   there was a conspiracy theory that these leaks were purposefully wrong.
[01:43:00.720 --> 01:43:02.720]   The Pixel 3 was like...
[01:43:02.720 --> 01:43:03.840]   Would that be wild?
[01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:04.320]   That wasn't...
[01:43:04.320 --> 01:43:06.880]   But yeah, but now I think there's just too much stuff out there.
[01:43:06.880 --> 01:43:07.360]   Yeah.
[01:43:07.360 --> 01:43:10.000]   If it is, it's like the biggest PR stunt ever.
[01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:10.480]   Yeah.
[01:43:10.480 --> 01:43:11.040]   Okay.
[01:43:11.040 --> 01:43:13.120]   And I will give them their credit for that.
[01:43:13.120 --> 01:43:14.400]   I want somebody to do that.
[01:43:14.400 --> 01:43:14.960]   I want somebody to do that.
[01:43:14.960 --> 01:43:16.400]   A bunch of stuff and then all of a sudden,
[01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:20.000]   they're like, "Man, we don't have this huge bucket at the top of this pixel."
[01:43:20.000 --> 01:43:20.640]   If they're out of way.
[01:43:20.640 --> 01:43:22.000]   They're not doing it, lunch.
[01:43:22.000 --> 01:43:22.800]   Not just suck.
[01:43:22.800 --> 01:43:25.920]   And we're putting the headphone jack back.
[01:43:25.920 --> 01:43:26.400]   Take that!
[01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:29.360]   I would buy for the amazing.
[01:43:29.360 --> 01:43:31.280]   I would say, I'll just to honor your...
[01:43:31.280 --> 01:43:33.520]   For some reason, even though they're doing,
[01:43:33.520 --> 01:43:35.440]   apparently, a Pixel Slate tablet,
[01:43:35.440 --> 01:43:37.040]   they're also going to update the Pixel book.
[01:43:37.040 --> 01:43:38.000]   I like the Pixel book.
[01:43:38.000 --> 01:43:39.120]   I'm a Chrome OS guy.
[01:43:40.000 --> 01:43:41.600]   Sometimes, not all the time.
[01:43:41.600 --> 01:43:43.760]   Maybe Pixel Buds.
[01:43:43.760 --> 01:43:44.640]   That was a flop.
[01:43:44.640 --> 01:43:46.960]   Those Pixel Buds are terrible,
[01:43:46.960 --> 01:43:48.160]   but maybe they'll have new ones.
[01:43:48.160 --> 01:43:50.800]   A little update for Chromecast.
[01:43:50.800 --> 01:43:55.040]   There will not be an Android Wear watch from Google this year.
[01:43:55.040 --> 01:43:58.000]   I think we know that company and told Tom's got.
[01:43:58.000 --> 01:43:58.960]   That's unfortunate.
[01:43:58.960 --> 01:44:00.080]   Yeah.
[01:44:00.080 --> 01:44:01.040]   This has really been a...
[01:44:01.040 --> 01:44:02.800]   I like it.
[01:44:02.800 --> 01:44:04.960]   It's a strong platform, but it's just died on the vine.
[01:44:04.960 --> 01:44:06.480]   They need it.
[01:44:06.480 --> 01:44:07.520]   I mean, with what...
[01:44:07.520 --> 01:44:09.440]   I feel like at this point,
[01:44:09.440 --> 01:44:12.240]   even though I like Android slightly better,
[01:44:12.240 --> 01:44:15.040]   the Apple watch is really...
[01:44:15.040 --> 01:44:15.600]   It's so funny.
[01:44:15.600 --> 01:44:16.960]   What is so interesting to me right now.
[01:44:16.960 --> 01:44:19.120]   And really almost vital,
[01:44:19.120 --> 01:44:21.520]   because of the fitness aspects,
[01:44:21.520 --> 01:44:22.320]   and the tracking,
[01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:23.920]   and the notifications,
[01:44:23.920 --> 01:44:26.480]   and the fact that I can't really get something very similar
[01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:27.920]   on Android at this point,
[01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:29.280]   that's as good.
[01:44:29.280 --> 01:44:30.640]   And I'm sure the Galaxy watch,
[01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:32.480]   I mean, it has some aspects,
[01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:33.920]   but it's just not as polished.
[01:44:33.920 --> 01:44:34.800]   Yeah.
[01:44:34.800 --> 01:44:35.920]   Now I'm with you.
[01:44:35.920 --> 01:44:37.760]   They did release the latest Android,
[01:44:37.760 --> 01:44:38.800]   an update to Android Wear,
[01:44:38.800 --> 01:44:39.760]   which people really like.
[01:44:39.760 --> 01:44:41.120]   Yeah.
[01:44:41.120 --> 01:44:41.920]   But you want to buy it.
[01:44:41.920 --> 01:44:43.760]   The Samsung watch has gotten good reviews,
[01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:45.600]   but it kind of mostly works at Samsung.
[01:44:45.600 --> 01:44:48.800]   I have a Samsung Gear 3 Frontier,
[01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:49.760]   which is not the latest,
[01:44:49.760 --> 01:44:50.480]   but it's...
[01:44:50.480 --> 01:44:51.760]   I really like it.
[01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:52.960]   But notice, I never wear it,
[01:44:52.960 --> 01:44:54.320]   because I have the Apple watch,
[01:44:54.320 --> 01:44:55.600]   and the Apple watch really now
[01:44:55.600 --> 01:44:57.840]   is coming to its own, I think.
[01:44:57.840 --> 01:44:58.320]   And they've...
[01:44:58.320 --> 01:44:59.200]   And they've nailed it.
[01:44:59.200 --> 01:45:00.240]   They've nailed it.
[01:45:00.240 --> 01:45:00.400]   Yeah.
[01:45:00.400 --> 01:45:01.680]   Between that and Fitbit,
[01:45:01.680 --> 01:45:02.800]   because Fitbit is, I think,
[01:45:02.800 --> 01:45:04.560]   pretty average regular people.
[01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:04.720]   Right.
[01:45:04.720 --> 01:45:05.360]   Right.
[01:45:05.360 --> 01:45:05.760]   It's a lot of expensive.
[01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:06.400]   Price points.
[01:45:06.400 --> 01:45:06.960]   Yeah.
[01:45:06.960 --> 01:45:07.760]   It's way cheaper.
[01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:08.240]   Yeah.
[01:45:08.240 --> 01:45:10.080]   I personally don't like Apple watch,
[01:45:10.080 --> 01:45:11.680]   because it's trying to be too much.
[01:45:11.680 --> 01:45:12.320]   What I don't...
[01:45:12.320 --> 01:45:14.400]   I don't want a second phone on my wrist,
[01:45:14.400 --> 01:45:17.200]   but I get it for the people that do want that.
[01:45:17.200 --> 01:45:18.640]   I think they've really nailed it.
[01:45:18.640 --> 01:45:21.520]   I prefer Fitbit, because I like the hell...
[01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:22.480]   You're a sleep expert.
[01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:23.120]   You're a sleep expert.
[01:45:23.120 --> 01:45:24.640]   And I'm a sleep expert, right?
[01:45:24.640 --> 01:45:28.800]   I do think the Fitbit Versa is a great watch for everyone else.
[01:45:28.800 --> 01:45:29.760]   That's not Apple.
[01:45:29.760 --> 01:45:30.160]   You know what I mean?
[01:45:30.160 --> 01:45:30.960]   If you're not...
[01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:30.960]   Exactly.
[01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:32.880]   Because it does a lot of the same things,
[01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:33.920]   but it doesn't...
[01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:34.720]   You know...
[01:45:34.720 --> 01:45:36.640]   Attempting me with that sleep apnea thing.
[01:45:36.640 --> 01:45:37.520]   That's tempting.
[01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:37.840]   Yeah.
[01:45:37.840 --> 01:45:38.880]   That is interesting.
[01:45:38.880 --> 01:45:41.280]   I have a wife, so I don't need to get that.
[01:45:41.280 --> 01:45:42.240]   Yeah, she'll tell you.
[01:45:42.240 --> 01:45:45.920]   Big elbow in the ribs.
[01:45:45.920 --> 01:45:47.680]   Probably as good as that watch.
[01:45:47.680 --> 01:45:51.680]   Our show they brought to you by Stamps.com.
[01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:53.360]   We're fans of Stamps.com,
[01:45:53.360 --> 01:45:55.280]   because frankly,
[01:45:55.280 --> 01:45:58.560]   I love the idea that I could do everything on demand, right?
[01:45:58.560 --> 01:46:00.160]   We live in an on demand world,
[01:46:00.160 --> 01:46:02.560]   including everything I would do at the US Post Office.
[01:46:02.560 --> 01:46:05.680]   I can buy and print US postage on demand.
[01:46:05.680 --> 01:46:07.680]   I get with Stamps.com,
[01:46:07.680 --> 01:46:09.120]   I get this nice USB scale,
[01:46:09.120 --> 01:46:12.640]   so I always know exactly how much postage to put on there.
[01:46:12.640 --> 01:46:13.920]   No more guessing.
[01:46:13.920 --> 01:46:15.600]   No more putting extra stamps on,
[01:46:15.600 --> 01:46:18.160]   or worse setting something postage due.
[01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:20.800]   You get all the services of the Post Office,
[01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:24.640]   right from your desk 24/7 when it fits your needs.
[01:46:24.640 --> 01:46:26.480]   Any class of mail,
[01:46:26.480 --> 01:46:28.640]   the mailman comes and picks it up.
[01:46:28.640 --> 01:46:32.480]   You can create your account on Stamps.com in minutes,
[01:46:32.480 --> 01:46:34.240]   it's not a postage meter.
[01:46:34.240 --> 01:46:35.840]   There's no equipment to lease,
[01:46:35.840 --> 01:46:37.840]   no special link to long-term commitments.
[01:46:37.840 --> 01:46:38.960]   You already have everything you need,
[01:46:38.960 --> 01:46:40.800]   your computer and your printer,
[01:46:40.800 --> 01:46:42.400]   and they'll send you that digital scale.
[01:46:42.400 --> 01:46:44.160]   It even makes suggestions.
[01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:46.000]   You could save money if you sent this media mail.
[01:46:46.000 --> 01:46:49.120]   It'll print out your return address,
[01:46:49.120 --> 01:46:50.800]   your company logo.
[01:46:50.800 --> 01:46:53.680]   It'll take the address from your contact list.
[01:46:53.680 --> 01:46:56.000]   If you're selling on Amazon or eBay or Etsy,
[01:46:56.000 --> 01:46:58.960]   it'll automatically fill in the form setting international mail.
[01:46:58.960 --> 01:47:00.880]   You even get discounts you can't get at the Post Office.
[01:47:00.880 --> 01:47:01.760]   I mean, it really is.
[01:47:02.400 --> 01:47:05.360]   Just if you're doing mailing for your business of any kind,
[01:47:05.360 --> 01:47:06.560]   Stamps.com.
[01:47:06.560 --> 01:47:08.800]   In fact, if you go to Stamps.com and use Twitch,
[01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:13.200]   you're going to get a really nice offer that includes $55 of free postage.
[01:47:13.200 --> 01:47:16.000]   You'll get a digital scale, you'll get a four-week trial.
[01:47:16.000 --> 01:47:18.560]   This is a very nice offer.
[01:47:18.560 --> 01:47:19.040]   What do you do?
[01:47:19.040 --> 01:47:20.080]   You go to Stamps.com,
[01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:22.160]   you click the microphone in the upper right,
[01:47:22.160 --> 01:47:24.720]   and you enter the offer code "Twit."
[01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:26.240]   If you've been thinking about trying,
[01:47:26.240 --> 01:47:29.600]   Stamps.com, this is a great time to do it.
[01:47:30.240 --> 01:47:32.640]   Maybe you're going to mail out a holiday cards this year,
[01:47:32.640 --> 01:47:35.600]   and now would be a good time to go to Stamps.com,
[01:47:35.600 --> 01:47:38.080]   click the microphone, and enter Twitch.
[01:47:38.080 --> 01:47:40.800]   Stamps.com.
[01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:45.360]   We're doing good here.
[01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:47.280]   We've covered the 1809,
[01:47:47.280 --> 01:47:49.200]   we've covered the new Surfaces,
[01:47:49.200 --> 01:47:51.280]   Amazon raising the minimum wage.
[01:47:51.280 --> 01:47:52.320]   They've been getting so much heat.
[01:47:52.320 --> 01:47:54.800]   As Jeff Bezos becomes the richest man in the world,
[01:47:54.800 --> 01:47:57.600]   their poor workers are suffering,
[01:47:57.600 --> 01:48:02.640]   so they've raised the minimum wage to $15 for all U.S. employees,
[01:48:02.640 --> 01:48:05.600]   and then they cut stock options.
[01:48:05.600 --> 01:48:10.160]   It's got to come out of somewhere,
[01:48:10.160 --> 01:48:13.280]   not out of Jeff's pocket, monthly bonuses gone.
[01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:17.120]   I guess there's nothing much to say about that.
[01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:22.080]   This was, I believe, a if I want to be cynical,
[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:26.960]   a ploy for Amazon to fend off unionization of its workers.
[01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:30.240]   Oh, interesting.
[01:48:30.240 --> 01:48:32.000]   Interesting.
[01:48:32.000 --> 01:48:34.720]   I wouldn't be surprised.
[01:48:34.720 --> 01:48:37.440]   Facebook is briefing Department of Homeland Security
[01:48:37.440 --> 01:48:39.280]   officials about that breach.
[01:48:39.280 --> 01:48:43.520]   They're concerned that there might be a backlash in Washington.
[01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:47.280]   It's bad enough Mark had to go testify once.
[01:48:47.280 --> 01:48:48.320]   He doesn't want to go back.
[01:48:48.320 --> 01:48:50.720]   I don't blame him.
[01:48:51.120 --> 01:48:56.880]   In an onstage interview Monday with the Wall Street Journal,
[01:48:56.880 --> 01:48:58.560]   as part of ad week in New York City,
[01:48:58.560 --> 01:49:00.480]   Facebook's vice president of marketing solutions,
[01:49:00.480 --> 01:49:01.840]   Carolyn Everson,
[01:49:01.840 --> 01:49:02.960]   compared hackers,
[01:49:02.960 --> 01:49:05.600]   the hackers who broke in,
[01:49:05.600 --> 01:49:09.280]   to an odorless, weightless intruder that walked in.
[01:49:09.280 --> 01:49:11.280]   None of the hackers I know, but okay.
[01:49:11.280 --> 01:49:16.320]   Isn't it the whole idea of intrusion?
[01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:19.440]   They were odorless and weightless.
[01:49:20.240 --> 01:49:22.000]   That's why we didn't discover it.
[01:49:22.000 --> 01:49:24.560]   They didn't, they were odorless and weightless.
[01:49:24.560 --> 01:49:27.040]   Okay.
[01:49:27.040 --> 01:49:28.320]   Let's see.
[01:49:28.320 --> 01:49:28.800]   What else?
[01:49:28.800 --> 01:49:35.200]   The feds have, we now know this happened a while ago,
[01:49:35.200 --> 01:49:42.720]   I think back in August, forced an iPhone 10 owner to unlock his phone with his face,
[01:49:42.720 --> 01:49:44.240]   face ID.
[01:49:44.240 --> 01:49:48.640]   The investigation was a child abuse investigation.
[01:49:48.640 --> 01:49:50.640]   Forbes has the exclusive on it.
[01:49:50.640 --> 01:49:56.320]   First known case in which law enforcement used face ID to open a suspect's phone.
[01:49:56.320 --> 01:50:00.720]   However, the thing I found interesting in this article was,
[01:50:00.720 --> 01:50:04.480]   this is now kind of status quo in search warrants,
[01:50:04.480 --> 01:50:09.360]   that they're having the judge or they're writing it up in such a way that they can do this.
[01:50:09.360 --> 01:50:15.840]   It's in the actual search warrant that they will be asked to unlock and they have to unlock their phone.
[01:50:15.840 --> 01:50:18.000]   I think the pen.
[01:50:18.960 --> 01:50:20.640]   Well, they can use a pen too.
[01:50:20.640 --> 01:50:22.800]   Actually, that's a really good question, which is the courts.
[01:50:22.800 --> 01:50:25.840]   Well, that's the, yeah, but the courts, you know, it's unclear.
[01:50:25.840 --> 01:50:26.640]   Or they can't compel you.
[01:50:26.640 --> 01:50:27.440]   They can't compel you.
[01:50:27.440 --> 01:50:32.160]   Well, that theory is coming out of your brain versus that's the theory using your face.
[01:50:32.160 --> 01:50:36.880]   That's the theory that you can, you know, because they're already taken fingerprints.
[01:50:36.880 --> 01:50:41.040]   They take care for DNA with or without your consent, face IDs and other one of them.
[01:50:41.040 --> 01:50:45.520]   So biometrics are not protected, but stuff in your mind is,
[01:50:46.640 --> 01:50:51.120]   but I would like to point out we're still waiting really for the definitive court case on this.
[01:50:51.120 --> 01:50:52.240]   True.
[01:50:52.240 --> 01:50:58.880]   So in theory, but I wouldn't, I wouldn't, you know what, just to race your damn phone.
[01:50:58.880 --> 01:51:00.800]   You got to do the power.
[01:51:00.800 --> 01:51:02.960]   Was it the power button and the volume key?
[01:51:02.960 --> 01:51:03.440]   Hold them.
[01:51:03.440 --> 01:51:03.680]   Yes.
[01:51:03.680 --> 01:51:05.600]   You go to go down and then out a lot.
[01:51:05.600 --> 01:51:06.960]   That's kind of really annoying.
[01:51:06.960 --> 01:51:10.480]   And then that triggers the, where you have to put your pin in, and then.
[01:51:10.480 --> 01:51:12.800]   Don't do it in New Zealand though.
[01:51:12.800 --> 01:51:19.760]   If you're going into New Zealand, travelers refusing digital search now face a fine of up to $5,000
[01:51:19.760 --> 01:51:22.000]   for custom even worth it.
[01:51:22.000 --> 01:51:23.200]   Worth it.
[01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:26.480]   If you're a criminal, I'll be visiting Trey Rack.
[01:51:26.480 --> 01:51:27.360]   Worth it.
[01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:29.520]   They say they won't look at your cloud.
[01:51:29.520 --> 01:51:32.240]   We're not going to the cloud.
[01:51:32.240 --> 01:51:34.240]   We'll examine your flown while it's on flight mode.
[01:51:34.240 --> 01:51:36.560]   Custom spokesperson, Terry Brown said.
[01:51:36.560 --> 01:51:39.680]   So if you're a bad guy, just here's a tip.
[01:51:40.720 --> 01:51:41.760]   Or start your stuff.
[01:51:41.760 --> 01:51:42.400]   Start in the cloud.
[01:51:42.400 --> 01:51:43.040]   In the cloud.
[01:51:43.040 --> 01:51:44.160]   High cloud is your friend.
[01:51:44.160 --> 01:51:45.680]   High cloud is your friend.
[01:51:45.680 --> 01:51:47.280]   Caliform.
[01:51:47.280 --> 01:51:47.600]   Go ahead.
[01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:48.560]   I don't know.
[01:51:48.560 --> 01:51:50.480]   I don't know what I think about this.
[01:51:50.480 --> 01:51:53.680]   This seems like it's so, I don't know.
[01:51:53.680 --> 01:51:58.160]   It just seems like I don't want, I don't have really anything on my phone that I need to hide.
[01:51:58.160 --> 01:52:00.720]   But I still don't want someone looking through it or my computer.
[01:52:00.720 --> 01:52:01.040]   Don't worry.
[01:52:01.040 --> 01:52:02.080]   They're still yours.
[01:52:02.080 --> 01:52:03.680]   You're a nice white boy.
[01:52:03.680 --> 01:52:04.560]   You'll be fine.
[01:52:04.560 --> 01:52:06.560]   I'm willing to bet.
[01:52:06.560 --> 01:52:09.920]   They've only done 500, 600 searches in New Zealand.
[01:52:10.560 --> 01:52:12.320]   A phone's a year.
[01:52:12.320 --> 01:52:16.000]   But I'm willing to bet, Ant's much more likely to get it than you are.
[01:52:16.000 --> 01:52:17.040]   Pretty sure of it.
[01:52:17.040 --> 01:52:18.000]   Pretty sure of that.
[01:52:18.000 --> 01:52:21.920]   And if Ant would wear a turban, we should do a little test.
[01:52:21.920 --> 01:52:23.200]   Just to see.
[01:52:23.200 --> 01:52:27.760]   I can't go from the United States.
[01:52:27.760 --> 01:52:28.880]   They barely look at me.
[01:52:28.880 --> 01:52:30.000]   They go, yeah, yeah, go on.
[01:52:30.000 --> 01:52:32.080]   The sad truth.
[01:52:32.080 --> 01:52:33.280]   There was a line.
[01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:34.160]   I can't too much.
[01:52:34.160 --> 01:52:35.280]   I get flagged.
[01:52:35.280 --> 01:52:35.680]   Yeah.
[01:52:35.680 --> 01:52:37.120]   Rubino, definitely.
[01:52:37.120 --> 01:52:37.600]   Look at it.
[01:52:37.600 --> 01:52:38.800]   What are you?
[01:52:38.800 --> 01:52:39.760]   What are you?
[01:52:39.760 --> 01:52:40.320]   What are you?
[01:52:40.320 --> 01:52:41.280]   Are you from Russia?
[01:52:41.280 --> 01:52:43.440]   It looks suspicious.
[01:52:43.440 --> 01:52:44.080]   I'll be honest.
[01:52:44.080 --> 01:52:47.040]   Nine times out of 10 at LAX,
[01:52:47.040 --> 01:52:50.640]   whatever the official song I do.
[01:52:50.640 --> 01:52:52.080]   They watch KTLA.
[01:52:52.080 --> 01:52:53.280]   Of course they do.
[01:52:53.280 --> 01:52:57.280]   It's actually, I was laughing one time because the guy just waved me by and I was like,
[01:52:57.280 --> 01:52:59.520]   well, now that I say this, it's going to be really...
[01:52:59.520 --> 01:53:01.600]   You got him in trouble, dude.
[01:53:01.600 --> 01:53:05.920]   Next time I go, no, it was just commenting on the last report.
[01:53:05.920 --> 01:53:08.080]   And I just thought it was so funny because I had this whole bag with me.
[01:53:08.080 --> 01:53:09.680]   And it just stayed in hell.
[01:53:09.680 --> 01:53:10.640]   Love your TV.
[01:53:10.640 --> 01:53:14.800]   The best thing, if you want to be a terrorist, get a job in local television.
[01:53:14.800 --> 01:53:15.760]   It's the best thing you can do.
[01:53:15.760 --> 01:53:21.040]   And I don't get any ideas tomorrow.
[01:53:21.040 --> 01:53:21.920]   No, no, no.
[01:53:21.920 --> 01:53:25.520]   I have to say, when I came back in the United States after my vacation a couple of weeks ago,
[01:53:25.520 --> 01:53:26.320]   I'm not kidding.
[01:53:26.320 --> 01:53:31.600]   So Johnny Jed is always saying, you got to get global...
[01:53:31.600 --> 01:53:33.520]   What is that? Global entry.
[01:53:33.520 --> 01:53:34.320]   Global entry.
[01:53:34.320 --> 01:53:34.800]   Come on.
[01:53:34.800 --> 01:53:35.120]   Did you?
[01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:36.080]   Global entry.
[01:53:36.080 --> 01:53:37.760]   So, because you get it and you get...
[01:53:37.760 --> 01:53:42.320]   So I'm looking, the global entry line at JFK, there's 80 people in it.
[01:53:42.320 --> 01:53:47.120]   I walk right up, I barely took out the passport, he said in the end,
[01:53:47.120 --> 01:53:50.240]   and walked through and they're still waiting in line for global entry.
[01:53:50.240 --> 01:53:51.440]   Yeah.
[01:53:51.440 --> 01:53:53.040]   Too many people know about it, Rubino.
[01:53:53.040 --> 01:53:56.400]   Those new kiosks at JFK are really, really nice.
[01:53:56.400 --> 01:53:57.600]   I do like that, yeah.
[01:53:57.600 --> 01:54:00.400]   And they print out a little receipt with a very bad picture of you.
[01:54:00.400 --> 01:54:00.640]   Yes.
[01:54:00.640 --> 01:54:05.120]   I didn't think the picture would go anywhere, so I made a funny face.
[01:54:05.120 --> 01:54:06.320]   And then all of a sudden, it printed it out.
[01:54:06.320 --> 01:54:07.120]   I'm like, oh, no.
[01:54:07.120 --> 01:54:08.000]   Oh, crap.
[01:54:08.000 --> 01:54:09.040]   That's okay.
[01:54:09.040 --> 01:54:10.720]   Because I go, hey, it's the Murrow.
[01:54:10.720 --> 01:54:12.320]   Look at him. He's a clown.
[01:54:12.320 --> 01:54:14.000]   Come on in the Murrow.
[01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:14.560]   I agree.
[01:54:14.560 --> 01:54:16.640]   It's you do get TSA pre with it.
[01:54:16.640 --> 01:54:18.240]   Yes, that's worth it.
[01:54:18.240 --> 01:54:19.520]   Yeah, that's worth it.
[01:54:19.520 --> 01:54:20.080]   Yes.
[01:54:20.080 --> 01:54:20.960]   That is worth it.
[01:54:20.960 --> 01:54:21.440]   Yeah.
[01:54:21.440 --> 01:54:23.280]   Because then they don't even have to take off your shoes.
[01:54:23.280 --> 01:54:25.040]   Yes, that's it.
[01:54:25.040 --> 01:54:26.320]   That's all for your belt.
[01:54:26.320 --> 01:54:27.200]   Or your Apple watch.
[01:54:27.200 --> 01:54:29.200]   It all goes through.
[01:54:29.200 --> 01:54:29.920]   It all works.
[01:54:29.920 --> 01:54:32.000]   If I take off my belt, my pants fall down.
[01:54:32.960 --> 01:54:33.840]   I am not kidding.
[01:54:33.840 --> 01:54:35.280]   It has happened several times.
[01:54:35.280 --> 01:54:36.400]   It's quite embarrassing.
[01:54:36.400 --> 01:54:41.280]   And then so what I'm doing is I'm carrying the bucket with my laptop and camera,
[01:54:41.280 --> 01:54:42.560]   and I'm holding up my pants.
[01:54:42.560 --> 01:54:44.720]   I've been in that boat too.
[01:54:44.720 --> 01:54:46.080]   Humiliating.
[01:54:46.080 --> 01:54:46.960]   It do make belts.
[01:54:46.960 --> 01:54:48.400]   It's us guys with big femurs.
[01:54:48.400 --> 01:54:49.200]   That's what it is.
[01:54:49.200 --> 01:54:57.120]   I will say I did have one predicament when I went to Mobile World Congress several years ago.
[01:54:57.120 --> 01:54:59.120]   It's made in Barcelona.
[01:55:00.800 --> 01:55:03.200]   Going through a little scanner and the scanner goes off.
[01:55:03.200 --> 01:55:07.600]   What most people don't know, I have a replaced left hip.
[01:55:07.600 --> 01:55:09.840]   Titanium and all that could stop them.
[01:55:09.840 --> 01:55:11.440]   Oh, yeah, you set off every alarm.
[01:55:11.440 --> 01:55:13.520]   And so it went off.
[01:55:13.520 --> 01:55:17.600]   And while I'm there in Barcelona, I'm not thinking about what I was doing,
[01:55:17.600 --> 01:55:19.360]   but I did like this.
[01:55:19.360 --> 01:55:20.320]   I tapped off.
[01:55:20.320 --> 01:55:22.720]   Probably the worst thing.
[01:55:22.720 --> 01:55:23.520]   The dark skin.
[01:55:23.520 --> 01:55:24.240]   They jumped you.
[01:55:24.240 --> 01:55:26.160]   Did they throw you the ground and pin you?
[01:55:26.160 --> 01:55:29.360]   Oh, it got physical pretty quick.
[01:55:29.360 --> 01:55:31.920]   I wasn't pressed at how quick they came over there.
[01:55:31.920 --> 01:55:32.720]   So, so, can you hear me?
[01:55:32.720 --> 01:55:34.640]   Of course, I don't speak a lick of Spanish.
[01:55:34.640 --> 01:55:38.080]   The second I did it, I knew it was the wrong thing to do.
[01:55:38.080 --> 01:55:39.920]   And I can laugh about it now.
[01:55:39.920 --> 01:55:40.880]   Wow, that's scary.
[01:55:40.880 --> 01:55:42.320]   I laughed about it after the fact.
[01:55:42.320 --> 01:55:43.040]   Yeah, that's scary.
[01:55:43.040 --> 01:55:46.720]   Because it was just an honest mistake and you know, if I say anything.
[01:55:46.720 --> 01:55:49.280]   So just in next time, I'll teach you a little Spanish.
[01:55:49.280 --> 01:55:50.960]   If that happens again, you just shout,
[01:55:50.960 --> 01:55:52.320]   "Under the handle, under the handle!"
[01:55:52.320 --> 01:55:55.200]   I think that means I'm okay.
[01:55:55.200 --> 01:55:57.120]   I might be wrong.
[01:55:58.560 --> 01:55:59.440]   Yeah, that's terrible.
[01:55:59.440 --> 01:56:00.880]   I'm sorry to hear that.
[01:56:00.880 --> 01:56:01.840]   Did it, did this?
[01:56:01.840 --> 01:56:02.560]   It's okay.
[01:56:02.560 --> 01:56:07.120]   I mean, the thing is, is I appreciate how quickly they reacted,
[01:56:07.120 --> 01:56:10.000]   you know, because they were trying to keep everybody else safe.
[01:56:10.000 --> 01:56:13.760]   Are we talking like two, three, like more than one person?
[01:56:13.760 --> 01:56:16.560]   Oh, it was at least four people come wild.
[01:56:16.560 --> 01:56:17.120]   That's good though.
[01:56:17.120 --> 01:56:18.480]   You're right, because they're on it.
[01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:18.480]   Wait, wait.
[01:56:18.480 --> 01:56:19.440]   They're on it.
[01:56:19.440 --> 01:56:21.680]   That's so funny, because when I got into Barcelona,
[01:56:21.680 --> 01:56:26.080]   and I'm thinking, this is the entry, the gateway to all of Europe,
[01:56:26.080 --> 01:56:29.280]   right? Once you're in Spain, you can go anywhere in the EU,
[01:56:29.280 --> 01:56:30.240]   and they don't look at you.
[01:56:30.240 --> 01:56:32.880]   So I thought, well, probably they'll probably, you know,
[01:56:32.880 --> 01:56:34.560]   screen me a little bit.
[01:56:34.560 --> 01:56:36.080]   Nothing.
[01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:37.520]   Nothing.
[01:56:37.520 --> 01:56:38.960]   Here's my passport.
[01:56:38.960 --> 01:56:40.080]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, get in there.
[01:56:40.080 --> 01:56:43.920]   I'm sure if I'm ever invited back to Mobile World Congress again,
[01:56:43.920 --> 01:56:47.360]   they are looking for this tall, bald-headed black dude to walk through there.
[01:56:47.360 --> 01:56:48.080]   Okay.
[01:56:48.080 --> 01:56:50.400]   The chatroom says instead of "underlayse"
[01:56:50.400 --> 01:56:52.160]   "Otracevesa po favor."
[01:56:52.160 --> 01:56:54.160]   Oh, not that I get.
[01:56:54.720 --> 01:56:57.760]   [laughter]
[01:56:57.760 --> 01:56:59.920]   I speak that language very well.
[01:56:59.920 --> 01:57:07.120]   California has enacted a net neutrality law.
[01:57:07.120 --> 01:57:10.800]   US government sues immediately to block it.
[01:57:10.800 --> 01:57:14.160]   So much for states, right?
[01:57:14.160 --> 01:57:18.000]   Well, this cracks me up because it's effectively an emission.
[01:57:18.000 --> 01:57:20.240]   So the net neutrality law is pretty bland.
[01:57:21.600 --> 01:57:24.160]   It says something I think we would all agree on.
[01:57:24.160 --> 01:57:28.960]   The new California law prohibits internet service.
[01:57:28.960 --> 01:57:30.640]   See how you feel about this?
[01:57:30.640 --> 01:57:34.080]   Internet service providers may not block or throttle lawful traffic.
[01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:38.480]   They may not require fees from websites or online services,
[01:57:38.480 --> 01:57:41.280]   or to deliver or prioritize traffic to consumers.
[01:57:41.280 --> 01:57:45.120]   It bans paid data cap exemptions.
[01:57:45.120 --> 01:57:46.320]   That's zero rating, right?
[01:57:46.320 --> 01:57:48.560]   So you get free Spotify.
[01:57:49.440 --> 01:57:53.600]   And says that ISPs cannot attempt to evade net neutrality by slowing down
[01:57:53.600 --> 01:57:55.520]   traffic at network interconnection points.
[01:57:55.520 --> 01:57:56.320]   That's all it says.
[01:57:56.320 --> 01:58:01.680]   So this is why I'm blown away because immediately the US government says,
[01:58:01.680 --> 01:58:02.640]   "No, no, we can't have that."
[01:58:02.640 --> 01:58:07.360]   And immediately AT&T in Verizon says, "We're suing!
[01:58:07.360 --> 01:58:08.080]   How dare you?"
[01:58:08.080 --> 01:58:11.760]   You don't agree that none of that should happen?
[01:58:11.760 --> 01:58:13.600]   Wait a minute.
[01:58:13.600 --> 01:58:15.680]   Didn't Ajit Pai said none of that would happen?
[01:58:15.680 --> 01:58:17.360]   That you don't need this regulation?
[01:58:17.360 --> 01:58:18.080]   Did he say that?
[01:58:19.120 --> 01:58:20.160]   So why are they suing?
[01:58:20.160 --> 01:58:21.200]   What are you worried about?
[01:58:21.200 --> 01:58:27.760]   As someone who lived through that Verizon Netflix issue years ago,
[01:58:27.760 --> 01:58:29.360]   where Verizon was supposedly-
[01:58:29.360 --> 01:58:31.120]   They were block modeling Netflix.
[01:58:31.120 --> 01:58:32.000]   The interconnect, right?
[01:58:32.000 --> 01:58:36.160]   I mean, this is just nonsense.
[01:58:36.160 --> 01:58:40.400]   And especially for, if you're a Republican and a conservative,
[01:58:40.400 --> 01:58:45.200]   this idea that states should be able to regulate their own commerce and-
[01:58:45.200 --> 01:58:46.000]   Well, well-
[01:58:46.000 --> 01:58:46.880]   I think they're a lot-
[01:58:46.880 --> 01:58:50.480]   I'm no lawyer, but it is in the Constitution that
[01:58:50.480 --> 01:58:53.120]   when it comes to interstate commerce,
[01:58:53.120 --> 01:58:54.800]   that's a federal thing, no state may-
[01:58:54.800 --> 01:58:55.360]   Right.
[01:58:55.360 --> 01:58:57.760]   And so they're saying, "Well, this is interstate commerce."
[01:58:57.760 --> 01:58:59.840]   The state is saying-
[01:58:59.840 --> 01:59:01.920]   This law was very carefully written because, of course,
[01:59:01.920 --> 01:59:04.640]   they knew that that would be the hook.
[01:59:04.640 --> 01:59:08.720]   It's been very carefully written not to interfere with interstate commerce,
[01:59:08.720 --> 01:59:10.320]   and they say, "But wait a minute.
[01:59:10.320 --> 01:59:13.280]   There is no federal regulation.
[01:59:13.280 --> 01:59:16.800]   The FCC struck that federal regulation,
[01:59:16.800 --> 01:59:19.520]   so we're not interfering with the feds at all.
[01:59:19.520 --> 01:59:22.800]   We're just saying here in California, we want this."
[01:59:22.800 --> 01:59:25.600]   Problem is,
[01:59:25.600 --> 01:59:28.880]   AT&T doesn't.
[01:59:28.880 --> 01:59:29.920]   And Verizon doesn't.
[01:59:29.920 --> 01:59:34.400]   And they're the ones who bought the federal legislature and apparently the FCC.
[01:59:34.400 --> 01:59:37.120]   Here's a law nobody would sue against.
[01:59:37.120 --> 01:59:41.680]   California law is now banning bots from pretending to be human.
[01:59:41.680 --> 01:59:42.480]   Yeah.
[01:59:42.480 --> 01:59:45.680]   They're like this one.
[01:59:45.680 --> 01:59:48.000]   This one's kind of scary.
[01:59:48.000 --> 01:59:52.240]   When I called a hotel, I was at Ignite a couple of weeks ago with Microsoft called
[01:59:52.240 --> 01:59:57.040]   the Hyatt and a bot picked up.
[01:59:57.040 --> 01:59:58.720]   But they're getting so realistic now.
[01:59:58.720 --> 02:00:02.000]   You can kind of tell it was fake, but it was a human talking, like human voice.
[02:00:02.000 --> 02:00:03.520]   But then when you would give your answer,
[02:00:03.520 --> 02:00:05.520]   be like, "Are you interested in reservations?"
[02:00:05.520 --> 02:00:06.560]   And you'd say, "Reservations."
[02:00:06.560 --> 02:00:08.080]   And then you'd hear a keyboard clicking.
[02:00:08.080 --> 02:00:10.640]   Like it was at AT&T.
[02:00:10.640 --> 02:00:12.800]   See, they're trying to trick you.
[02:00:12.800 --> 02:00:14.160]   That's bad.
[02:00:14.160 --> 02:00:20.000]   It's like a filler, obviously, as it's wild looking at the information.
[02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:22.880]   But it does simulate a lot like you're talking to a person.
[02:00:22.880 --> 02:00:26.080]   Well, it's the same argument that Google made with the duplex.
[02:00:26.080 --> 02:00:29.120]   That's why they messed this law because of that.
[02:00:29.120 --> 02:00:32.880]   And the um, because they said, "Oh, that makes it more natural."
[02:00:32.880 --> 02:00:35.360]   But they're using that time to kind of compute things as well.
[02:00:35.360 --> 02:00:37.840]   So, I mean, it's weird.
[02:00:37.840 --> 02:00:44.080]   I mean, California law should say, the bot has to say, "Working instead of typing."
[02:00:44.080 --> 02:00:45.680]   Working, working.
[02:00:45.680 --> 02:00:48.480]   California.
[02:00:48.480 --> 02:00:50.640]   As long as it works, I don't care.
[02:00:50.640 --> 02:00:52.000]   Just make it work.
[02:00:52.000 --> 02:00:55.920]   Now, so the problem there, though, is it's not so much if I'm calling the
[02:00:55.920 --> 02:00:56.720]   Hyatt, right?
[02:00:56.720 --> 02:00:58.720]   I'm expecting someone like that.
[02:00:58.720 --> 02:01:03.760]   It's if I get a call that could be a bot and I don't know, that's the issue.
[02:01:03.760 --> 02:01:05.680]   Like you could do a lot of deception here.
[02:01:06.720 --> 02:01:10.880]   You think about it, if you can program bots to randomly call people, this is like the new
[02:01:10.880 --> 02:01:13.360]   war dialing of, uh, 2012.
[02:01:13.360 --> 02:01:16.320]   Well, you can see the point of it when you read the text.
[02:01:16.320 --> 02:01:20.720]   The measure bans automated accounts for pretending to be reappable in order to,
[02:01:20.720 --> 02:01:25.680]   quote, "incentivize a purchase or sale of goods or services in a commercial transaction
[02:01:25.680 --> 02:01:28.080]   or to influence a vote in election."
[02:01:28.080 --> 02:01:30.400]   Is this, you know, okay.
[02:01:30.400 --> 02:01:34.720]   They don't want somebody to call up saying, "Hi, this is Rich DeMiro.
[02:01:34.720 --> 02:01:36.560]   And I'd like to sell you a condo."
[02:01:36.560 --> 02:01:38.800]   Right?
[02:01:38.800 --> 02:01:42.800]   Well, I mean, with this, I mean,
[02:01:42.800 --> 02:01:43.440]   I want you to vote.
[02:01:43.440 --> 02:01:51.360]   I mean, this is kind of like another, I mean, it's just, these bots are, I mean,
[02:01:51.360 --> 02:01:55.120]   it's weird because on one side, they are kind of useful for certain things.
[02:01:55.120 --> 02:01:58.720]   Like when you're interacting with an airline, like, I always kind of avoid all this stuff
[02:01:58.720 --> 02:02:01.200]   because I feel like just the human could do it better.
[02:02:01.200 --> 02:02:05.520]   But, you know, now if you see Bank of America is advertising that new thing called like Erica.
[02:02:05.520 --> 02:02:05.840]   Right.
[02:02:05.840 --> 02:02:07.520]   It's like, you can ask for your credit score.
[02:02:07.520 --> 02:02:08.560]   Hey, Erica, what's my credit?
[02:02:08.560 --> 02:02:09.120]   Right.
[02:02:09.120 --> 02:02:13.520]   It's really weird, the world that we're living in because these things can be useful.
[02:02:13.520 --> 02:02:16.240]   It's better than a very elaborate tree, right?
[02:02:16.240 --> 02:02:17.920]   Press one to do, yeah.
[02:02:17.920 --> 02:02:23.360]   I mean, it, but I think the real concern here is election, uh, tampering, really.
[02:02:23.360 --> 02:02:23.760]   Sure.
[02:02:23.760 --> 02:02:25.200]   That's really what this is all about.
[02:02:25.200 --> 02:02:28.640]   California is, which is, apparently California is now in the forefront.
[02:02:29.360 --> 02:02:29.920]   Yeah.
[02:02:29.920 --> 02:02:31.280]   There's a vacuum in DC.
[02:02:31.280 --> 02:02:35.280]   So California is now going to outlaw weak password use.
[02:02:35.280 --> 02:02:35.760]   Wow.
[02:02:35.760 --> 02:02:42.240]   Starting in 2020, manufacturers of connected devices will have to build in reasonable security
[02:02:42.240 --> 02:02:45.680]   features, including better password protection.
[02:02:45.680 --> 02:02:47.200]   Now it's, it's still a bill.
[02:02:47.200 --> 02:02:48.400]   It's not a law yet.
[02:02:48.400 --> 02:02:51.360]   But, um, that's an interest.
[02:02:51.360 --> 02:02:53.760]   It's interesting that lawmakers are getting like that.
[02:02:53.760 --> 02:02:54.240]   Yeah.
[02:02:54.240 --> 02:02:58.320]   That's, that's smart, actually, because it's again going back to protecting ourselves from
[02:02:58.320 --> 02:03:02.160]   ourselves because I don't know if the first time you got a router from one of these companies,
[02:03:02.160 --> 02:03:06.720]   like AT&T or Verizon, where it was like a different code at the bottom, like it had like a unique
[02:03:06.720 --> 02:03:07.600]   white-like code.
[02:03:07.600 --> 02:03:08.160]   Yeah.
[02:03:08.160 --> 02:03:09.360]   Send it in the university.
[02:03:09.360 --> 02:03:09.600]   Yeah.
[02:03:09.600 --> 02:03:12.720]   So this is a, this is actually quite smart.
[02:03:12.720 --> 02:03:16.080]   I, it's weird though, because when they manufacture these things over in China,
[02:03:16.080 --> 02:03:18.880]   I mean, do they just have to do the whole batch this way?
[02:03:18.880 --> 02:03:21.440]   Or is it just the ones dedicated to California?
[02:03:21.440 --> 02:03:22.640]   I mean, it gets complicated, but.
[02:03:22.640 --> 02:03:27.200]   And that's the point I think of the DOJ lawsuit is, look, you can't have different
[02:03:27.200 --> 02:03:32.080]   laws in every state because then how does a company do interstate business?
[02:03:32.080 --> 02:03:32.640]   Right.
[02:03:32.640 --> 02:03:35.120]   And it's really expensive and tough.
[02:03:35.120 --> 02:03:38.880]   But California has always been dealing this too with emissions for auto.
[02:03:38.880 --> 02:03:38.880]   Yeah.
[02:03:38.880 --> 02:03:40.080]   There's a bit of a bit of a default.
[02:03:40.080 --> 02:03:40.960]   I think we could take credit.
[02:03:40.960 --> 02:03:44.320]   I mean, because LA was such a pit, you couldn't breathe.
[02:03:44.320 --> 02:03:45.200]   Yeah.
[02:03:45.200 --> 02:03:46.960]   California created emissions laws.
[02:03:46.960 --> 02:03:49.360]   By the way, the air is, is great now, right in LA.
[02:03:49.360 --> 02:03:51.520]   Well, it's better.
[02:03:51.520 --> 02:03:53.120]   I wouldn't say, I wouldn't say great.
[02:03:53.120 --> 02:03:53.760]   It's better.
[02:03:53.760 --> 02:03:54.480]   It's breathable.
[02:03:54.480 --> 02:03:56.720]   It's not Beijing bad.
[02:03:56.720 --> 02:03:57.760]   That's not Beijing.
[02:03:57.760 --> 02:03:59.600]   Probably would have been if it is.
[02:03:59.600 --> 02:04:03.680]   And as a result, automakers all over the world started reducing emissions.
[02:04:03.680 --> 02:04:07.920]   So I think that there is some case to be made that, you know, for us to step forward.
[02:04:07.920 --> 02:04:12.480]   Let's take a little break and then a couple more things.
[02:04:12.480 --> 02:04:15.440]   But first, a word from our sponsor.
[02:04:15.440 --> 02:04:18.240]   "Quicken loans, the best lender in the nation."
[02:04:18.240 --> 02:04:21.760]   Number one, in volume number one in customer satisfaction.
[02:04:21.760 --> 02:04:22.640]   And that's not according to me.
[02:04:22.640 --> 02:04:24.400]   That's according to JD Power.
[02:04:24.400 --> 02:04:26.800]   They've won the JD Power Customer Satisfaction Award.
[02:04:26.800 --> 02:04:28.960]   Number one, eight years in a row.
[02:04:28.960 --> 02:04:29.680]   That's pretty good.
[02:04:29.680 --> 02:04:30.960]   Eight consecutive years.
[02:04:30.960 --> 02:04:36.880]   And I'll tell you, the way you get to this is by thinking about the customer experience.
[02:04:36.880 --> 02:04:40.800]   And that's exactly what they've done by creating Rocket Mortgage.
[02:04:40.800 --> 02:04:44.800]   This is an entirely online, home loan approval process.
[02:04:44.800 --> 02:04:45.760]   You could do it on your phone.
[02:04:45.760 --> 02:04:46.880]   You could do it in an open house.
[02:04:46.880 --> 02:04:47.760]   And it's quick.
[02:04:47.760 --> 02:04:49.280]   It's really a three-step process.
[02:04:49.280 --> 02:04:51.200]   They call it the power buying process.
[02:04:51.920 --> 02:04:53.920]   It starts with a few simple questions.
[02:04:53.920 --> 02:04:54.880]   You don't have to go to the bank.
[02:04:54.880 --> 02:04:56.960]   You don't have to fill out a 20-page application.
[02:04:56.960 --> 02:04:57.840]   You just do it on your phone.
[02:04:57.840 --> 02:05:01.200]   You go to rocketmortgage.com/twit2.
[02:05:01.200 --> 02:05:02.960]   Answer a few simple questions.
[02:05:02.960 --> 02:05:05.520]   You pick the term of the loan, the rate, the down payment.
[02:05:05.520 --> 02:05:08.080]   And then they give you pre-qualified approval.
[02:05:08.080 --> 02:05:09.680]   And that happens within just a few minutes.
[02:05:09.680 --> 02:05:12.080]   That's enough to do it in an open house.
[02:05:12.080 --> 02:05:14.160]   So you know, yeah, good, good.
[02:05:14.160 --> 02:05:15.040]   We could get this loan.
[02:05:15.040 --> 02:05:16.640]   Then the best part.
[02:05:16.640 --> 02:05:17.520]   This is awesome.
[02:05:17.520 --> 02:05:19.760]   Within 24 hours, you don't have to do anything.
[02:05:19.760 --> 02:05:21.840]   You don't have to go get pay stubs or
[02:05:21.840 --> 02:05:22.800]   bank statements or anything.
[02:05:22.800 --> 02:05:25.280]   They'll verify your income assets and credit.
[02:05:25.280 --> 02:05:29.360]   And within 24 hours, give you verified approval.
[02:05:29.360 --> 02:05:31.600]   Now you've got the letter that says these guys are good for it.
[02:05:31.600 --> 02:05:32.400]   They've got the loan.
[02:05:32.400 --> 02:05:35.360]   That means you go right to the front of the line
[02:05:35.360 --> 02:05:36.160]   when you're buying a house.
[02:05:36.160 --> 02:05:37.040]   That's awesome.
[02:05:37.040 --> 02:05:38.080]   But there's still an issue.
[02:05:38.080 --> 02:05:41.520]   There's still some insecurity because interest rates are going up, right?
[02:05:41.520 --> 02:05:42.880]   For the first time in a few years,
[02:05:42.880 --> 02:05:46.640]   there's the potential that if you take too long looking for a house,
[02:05:46.640 --> 02:05:49.040]   your loan could cost you thousands of dollars more.
[02:05:49.040 --> 02:05:50.160]   That's why at step three,
[02:05:50.720 --> 02:05:52.560]   once you've got that verified approval,
[02:05:52.560 --> 02:05:56.560]   you qualify for their all new exclusive rate shield approval.
[02:05:56.560 --> 02:05:59.520]   That locks your rate for up to 90 days while you shop.
[02:05:59.520 --> 02:06:04.480]   You've got up to three months to look for a house with no fear that the rates will go up
[02:06:04.480 --> 02:06:05.200]   because they can't.
[02:06:05.200 --> 02:06:05.920]   They're locked.
[02:06:05.920 --> 02:06:09.040]   If the rates go up, yours stays the same.
[02:06:09.040 --> 02:06:10.480]   If they go down, yours is go down.
[02:06:10.480 --> 02:06:11.360]   So you win either way.
[02:06:11.360 --> 02:06:12.880]   But I think that's nice.
[02:06:12.880 --> 02:06:14.960]   It takes the anxiety out of shopping for home.
[02:06:14.960 --> 02:06:16.160]   You don't want to be rushed.
[02:06:16.160 --> 02:06:18.640]   You don't want the feeling that, well, we better buy this house.
[02:06:18.640 --> 02:06:19.600]   You want the right house.
[02:06:20.480 --> 02:06:25.520]   Again, quick and loans, the best lender in the country and things like this,
[02:06:25.520 --> 02:06:27.360]   rate shield approval that makes such a difference.
[02:06:27.360 --> 02:06:32.320]   To get started, go to rocketmortgage.com/twit
[02:06:32.320 --> 02:06:35.120]   rocketmortgage.com/twit and the number two,
[02:06:35.120 --> 02:06:38.320]   rate shield approval is only valid in certain 30-year purchase transactions,
[02:06:38.320 --> 02:06:41.040]   additional conditions or exclusions may apply
[02:06:41.040 --> 02:06:43.600]   based on quick and loans data in comparison to public data records.
[02:06:43.600 --> 02:06:46.400]   Equal housing, lender license in all 50 states and MLS,
[02:06:46.400 --> 02:06:49.680]   consumeraccess.org, number 30, 30, get started today.
[02:06:49.680 --> 02:06:52.960]   rocketmortgage.com/twit2.
[02:06:52.960 --> 02:06:57.440]   We thank rocketmortgage and quick and loans for supporting Twit.
[02:06:57.440 --> 02:06:58.960]   I didn't ask you this.
[02:06:58.960 --> 02:07:00.880]   Did you guys get the presidential alert?
[02:07:00.880 --> 02:07:03.280]   I did.
[02:07:03.280 --> 02:07:04.080]   Yes, sir.
[02:07:04.080 --> 02:07:04.480]   I did not.
[02:07:04.480 --> 02:07:05.920]   You did not.
[02:07:05.920 --> 02:07:10.240]   The non-tossed feature, you've been kicked out of the country, by the way.
[02:07:10.240 --> 02:07:11.440]   You have to leave now.
[02:07:11.440 --> 02:07:13.840]   I got it on one of my phones.
[02:07:13.840 --> 02:07:14.560]   I have two phones.
[02:07:14.560 --> 02:07:15.920]   I have an AT&T in Verizon.
[02:07:15.920 --> 02:07:17.920]   I got it on my AT&T.
[02:07:17.920 --> 02:07:19.360]   I did not get it on my Verizon.
[02:07:19.360 --> 02:07:22.640]   So the FCC is asking that you contact them if you didn't get it.
[02:07:22.640 --> 02:07:24.080]   Oh, yeah.
[02:07:24.080 --> 02:07:25.440]   I'm just going to call them right now.
[02:07:25.440 --> 02:07:26.080]   Call them.
[02:07:26.080 --> 02:07:26.640]   They're waiting.
[02:07:26.640 --> 02:07:28.480]   A van will come by.
[02:07:28.480 --> 02:07:29.520]   Yeah.
[02:07:29.520 --> 02:07:30.960]   They'll be popping in.
[02:07:30.960 --> 02:07:32.320]   We were looking for you, Rich.
[02:07:32.320 --> 02:07:33.680]   This is how we...
[02:07:33.680 --> 02:07:36.400]   No, it's funny that you were going to find that because if...
[02:07:36.400 --> 02:07:40.640]   You know, I was here and you saw the video on our promo.
[02:07:40.640 --> 02:07:42.080]   I had four phones in front of me.
[02:07:42.080 --> 02:07:43.440]   Three went off.
[02:07:43.440 --> 02:07:44.080]   One did not.
[02:07:44.080 --> 02:07:47.120]   And it was my iPhone.
[02:07:47.120 --> 02:07:50.160]   And I'm wondering, it's on T-Mobile, but we use a femto cell,
[02:07:50.160 --> 02:07:52.240]   one of those little micro cells.
[02:07:52.240 --> 02:07:54.400]   I'm wondering if that's why it didn't go off.
[02:07:54.400 --> 02:07:55.760]   Lisa's didn't either.
[02:07:55.760 --> 02:07:58.400]   She's also using the T-Mobile iPhone.
[02:07:58.400 --> 02:07:59.520]   Did yours go off, John?
[02:07:59.520 --> 02:08:01.200]   You weren't here.
[02:08:01.200 --> 02:08:04.400]   Mine was an iPhone that didn't work, the Verizon one.
[02:08:04.400 --> 02:08:05.680]   My pixel...
[02:08:05.680 --> 02:08:07.680]   I actually had it off because I was traveling.
[02:08:07.680 --> 02:08:10.240]   As soon as I turned it on, it did come through instantly.
[02:08:10.240 --> 02:08:10.720]   Oh, interesting.
[02:08:10.720 --> 02:08:11.520]   So it's not...
[02:08:11.520 --> 02:08:13.840]   Did you talk about this on KTLA?
[02:08:13.840 --> 02:08:14.640]   Did you warn people?
[02:08:14.640 --> 02:08:18.160]   Because I think a lot of people were worried when they saw the words "presidential"
[02:08:18.160 --> 02:08:18.320]   like...
[02:08:18.320 --> 02:08:18.560]   Yes.
[02:08:18.560 --> 02:08:19.520]   Oh, yeah.
[02:08:19.520 --> 02:08:21.520]   This was a talker.
[02:08:21.520 --> 02:08:24.800]   I mean, the story that...
[02:08:24.800 --> 02:08:29.200]   It was just funny how it was like the president texting us or tweeting us or whatever,
[02:08:29.200 --> 02:08:30.720]   which isn't really the case.
[02:08:30.720 --> 02:08:33.600]   But everyone, the biggest question was how to turn this off,
[02:08:33.600 --> 02:08:34.560]   which you can't do.
[02:08:34.560 --> 02:08:34.560]   You can't.
[02:08:34.560 --> 02:08:35.600]   I can't.
[02:08:35.600 --> 02:08:36.640]   It's permanent.
[02:08:36.640 --> 02:08:41.360]   So I did get one phone that was a little different than the others.
[02:08:41.360 --> 02:08:43.520]   I got this alert and I thought this was a little strange.
[02:08:44.480 --> 02:08:45.280]   Um...
[02:08:45.280 --> 02:08:49.280]   From Suthulu, "No action is needed. He will find you."
[02:08:49.280 --> 02:08:53.120]   I don't know.
[02:08:53.120 --> 02:08:55.040]   That's from Reddit, obviously, if fake.
[02:08:55.040 --> 02:08:56.720]   Oh, man.
[02:08:56.720 --> 02:08:59.040]   Well, at least the system sort of works.
[02:08:59.040 --> 02:09:03.680]   I just...
[02:09:03.680 --> 02:09:07.680]   I wonder how many spam text we're going to see in the next week.
[02:09:07.680 --> 02:09:07.680]   Oh, yeah.
[02:09:07.680 --> 02:09:09.200]   "Presidential alert.
[02:09:09.200 --> 02:09:10.400]   Time to buy that condo."
[02:09:10.400 --> 02:09:13.200]   Or download this app by clicking this link.
[02:09:13.440 --> 02:09:13.920]   Yeah.
[02:09:13.920 --> 02:09:14.720]   And, you know...
[02:09:14.720 --> 02:09:14.720]   Yeah.
[02:09:14.720 --> 02:09:18.960]   Well, hey Rich, it's been great having you.
[02:09:18.960 --> 02:09:19.840]   Want to please come back?
[02:09:19.840 --> 02:09:21.360]   Rich time row?
[02:09:21.360 --> 02:09:21.760]   Thank you.
[02:09:21.760 --> 02:09:24.080]   ATLA, you can read his stuff,
[02:09:24.080 --> 02:09:28.160]   follow him and get this podcast at richontech.tv.
[02:09:28.160 --> 02:09:33.440]   I think a lot of people are familiar with you from CNET.
[02:09:33.440 --> 02:09:36.640]   And where else have you been?
[02:09:36.640 --> 02:09:37.680]   You've been all over the place.
[02:09:37.680 --> 02:09:39.360]   CNET?
[02:09:39.360 --> 02:09:40.000]   Let's see.
[02:09:40.000 --> 02:09:42.640]   Yeah, I mean CNET was my big kind of tech world thing.
[02:09:42.640 --> 02:09:44.000]   And then I've done a lot of local news.
[02:09:44.000 --> 02:09:46.560]   I was, you know, channel one news also.
[02:09:46.560 --> 02:09:48.320]   If you're familiar with that, that was in high schools.
[02:09:48.320 --> 02:09:49.280]   That was kind of my big job.
[02:09:49.280 --> 02:09:50.240]   You were on channel one in high school?
[02:09:50.240 --> 02:09:51.040]   That's awesome.
[02:09:51.040 --> 02:09:51.520]   Yeah.
[02:09:51.520 --> 02:09:53.600]   That was like my...
[02:09:53.600 --> 02:09:54.560]   That's how you got started?
[02:09:54.560 --> 02:09:56.560]   Not how I got started.
[02:09:56.560 --> 02:09:58.400]   Yeah, but I worked there.
[02:09:58.400 --> 02:09:58.800]   That's cool.
[02:09:58.800 --> 02:10:00.000]   Channel one was like...
[02:10:00.000 --> 02:10:02.000]   Channel one was like...
[02:10:02.000 --> 02:10:05.520]   For schools only, right?
[02:10:05.520 --> 02:10:06.080]   Yes.
[02:10:06.080 --> 02:10:08.080]   And I think it went out of business just recently.
[02:10:08.080 --> 02:10:09.360]   Like I think it's over.
[02:10:09.360 --> 02:10:10.240]   Yeah, I think you're right.
[02:10:10.800 --> 02:10:12.800]   But that was amazing because they had...
[02:10:12.800 --> 02:10:15.200]   It was like young kids that didn't know how to do anything,
[02:10:15.200 --> 02:10:17.520]   but they had these really like older producers,
[02:10:17.520 --> 02:10:19.280]   which by the way, were probably like 30 at the time.
[02:10:19.280 --> 02:10:20.880]   Yeah, they felt old, right?
[02:10:20.880 --> 02:10:21.680]   They felt old.
[02:10:21.680 --> 02:10:23.280]   And they had...
[02:10:23.280 --> 02:10:25.200]   They were the ones that were kind of driving you
[02:10:25.200 --> 02:10:26.480]   and helping you do everything.
[02:10:26.480 --> 02:10:29.440]   But I learned so much there about how to create news and...
[02:10:29.440 --> 02:10:30.640]   Oh man, what an opera story.
[02:10:30.640 --> 02:10:31.120]   ...and all that.
[02:10:31.120 --> 02:10:32.160]   Yeah, it was really, really neat.
[02:10:32.160 --> 02:10:33.360]   Yeah, the farewell.
[02:10:33.360 --> 02:10:35.760]   Here's the farewell from channel one.
[02:10:35.760 --> 02:10:37.600]   Oh, so sad.
[02:10:37.600 --> 02:10:38.080]   Yeah.
[02:10:38.080 --> 02:10:39.920]   I mean, this is what made me want to become a journalist.
[02:10:39.920 --> 02:10:40.560]   I'll be honest.
[02:10:40.560 --> 02:10:41.360]   This was...
[02:10:41.360 --> 02:10:42.640]   Oh, goodbye.
[02:10:42.640 --> 02:10:44.480]   Nice clean cut people.
[02:10:44.480 --> 02:10:45.920]   All over the world.
[02:10:45.920 --> 02:10:47.040]   Representing everyone.
[02:10:47.040 --> 02:10:48.960]   Every demographic in the nation,
[02:10:48.960 --> 02:10:52.560]   we've got one Asian woman, two African Americans,
[02:10:52.560 --> 02:10:53.360]   and one stud.
[02:10:53.360 --> 02:10:55.600]   They didn't ask me to do a...
[02:10:55.600 --> 02:10:57.200]   Were you in the stud category, Richard?
[02:10:57.200 --> 02:10:58.000]   No, I was not.
[02:10:58.000 --> 02:10:59.760]   It's like the skinny dorky guy.
[02:10:59.760 --> 02:11:00.800]   Oh, skinny dorky guy.
[02:11:00.800 --> 02:11:01.920]   You gotta have one of those.
[02:11:01.920 --> 02:11:03.040]   I gotta have one of those.
[02:11:03.040 --> 02:11:03.760]   Yeah.
[02:11:03.760 --> 02:11:05.920]   Check all the boxes.
[02:11:08.800 --> 02:11:10.320]   Why is channel one closing?
[02:11:10.320 --> 02:11:13.040]   I don't know, but it is.
[02:11:13.040 --> 02:11:15.280]   Maybe they lost money.
[02:11:15.280 --> 02:11:16.160]   I don't know.
[02:11:16.160 --> 02:11:17.840]   Maybe they miss Rich DiMuro.
[02:11:17.840 --> 02:11:20.560]   Rich you will find on KTLA channel five.
[02:11:20.560 --> 02:11:21.840]   It's channel five, right?
[02:11:21.840 --> 02:11:22.160]   Yep.
[02:11:22.160 --> 02:11:22.800]   Channel five?
[02:11:22.800 --> 02:11:23.360]   Yep.
[02:11:23.360 --> 02:11:26.560]   And you're on most evenings on the evening news when it went...
[02:11:26.560 --> 02:11:28.880]   No, I wake up at 3 a.m. every day.
[02:11:28.880 --> 02:11:29.840]   I'm on board.
[02:11:29.840 --> 02:11:30.560]   Every morning.
[02:11:30.560 --> 02:11:31.120]   Yeah.
[02:11:31.120 --> 02:11:31.360]   No.
[02:11:31.360 --> 02:11:33.360]   So, yeah.
[02:11:33.360 --> 02:11:33.840]   I'm on...
[02:11:33.840 --> 02:11:34.640]   That's too early.
[02:11:34.640 --> 02:11:36.640]   4 a.m. to 10 a.m.
[02:11:36.640 --> 02:11:37.760]   You gotta get my schedule.
[02:11:37.760 --> 02:11:38.480]   I show up at all.
[02:11:38.480 --> 02:11:40.800]   I love your schedule, we got one.
[02:11:40.800 --> 02:11:46.320]   And in fact, most people watching though, sometimes not even on that.
[02:11:46.320 --> 02:11:48.080]   So, yeah.
[02:11:48.080 --> 02:11:52.480]   I've been on that live stream and seen you just sort of casually watching.
[02:11:52.480 --> 02:11:53.680]   Oh, we got a show to do.
[02:11:53.680 --> 02:11:55.120]   The gear is all messed up.
[02:11:55.120 --> 02:11:55.440]   What?
[02:11:55.440 --> 02:11:59.200]   When I wanted to get there at 10 for the weekend show,
[02:11:59.200 --> 02:12:00.320]   they're like, why so early?
[02:12:00.320 --> 02:12:01.120]   Oh my god.
[02:12:01.120 --> 02:12:02.640]   They told me you got here at 10.
[02:12:02.640 --> 02:12:04.480]   They weren't...
[02:12:04.480 --> 02:12:05.520]   I felt bad for John.
[02:12:05.520 --> 02:12:06.880]   Where did he get in so early?
[02:12:06.880 --> 02:12:07.120]   No.
[02:12:07.120 --> 02:12:08.960]   John is like, I'm usually just rolling in.
[02:12:08.960 --> 02:12:11.360]   I get my quiet time.
[02:12:11.360 --> 02:12:12.320]   We have it set up.
[02:12:12.320 --> 02:12:16.000]   So, I leave the house five minutes before 11.
[02:12:16.000 --> 02:12:17.920]   The show begins at 11.0630.
[02:12:17.920 --> 02:12:21.600]   I leave the house five minutes to 11.
[02:12:21.600 --> 02:12:24.320]   I pull up round about 11.01,
[02:12:24.320 --> 02:12:27.040]   11.02, sometimes 11.03, 11.04.
[02:12:27.040 --> 02:12:31.520]   John by now knows he's got to be standing at the back door with it open.
[02:12:31.520 --> 02:12:34.880]   Have the other door propped open and the seat ready.
[02:12:35.600 --> 02:12:40.000]   All the buttons pushed so that I can run in and sit down
[02:12:40.000 --> 02:12:42.960]   and turn on the microphone and say, good morning.
[02:12:42.960 --> 02:12:45.440]   I got life going to do it now.
[02:12:45.440 --> 02:12:48.560]   Yeah.
[02:12:48.560 --> 02:12:49.280]   I love that.
[02:12:49.280 --> 02:12:50.400]   I love it.
[02:12:50.400 --> 02:12:50.960]   I love it.
[02:12:50.960 --> 02:12:51.520]   Okay.
[02:12:51.520 --> 02:12:52.240]   I have been late.
[02:12:52.240 --> 02:12:53.360]   I think what?
[02:12:53.360 --> 02:12:54.480]   Twice in...
[02:12:54.480 --> 02:12:58.560]   You know, I've been doing this thing since 2004.
[02:12:58.560 --> 02:12:58.960]   What are that?
[02:12:58.960 --> 02:13:01.120]   It'll be 15 years in January.
[02:13:01.120 --> 02:13:01.440]   Late.
[02:13:01.440 --> 02:13:01.760]   Wow.
[02:13:01.760 --> 02:13:02.480]   Big deal.
[02:13:02.480 --> 02:13:04.640]   And when I'm late, you know what they do?
[02:13:04.640 --> 02:13:06.880]   The engineer knows about this in Los Angeles.
[02:13:06.880 --> 02:13:10.960]   He runs an old show because I say pretty much the same thing at the beginning of one time.
[02:13:10.960 --> 02:13:12.160]   You're giving away all your secrets.
[02:13:12.160 --> 02:13:13.760]   He runs through the old show.
[02:13:13.760 --> 02:13:14.400]   It's the same thing.
[02:13:14.400 --> 02:13:15.440]   I lay all the part of the tech.
[02:13:15.440 --> 02:13:22.080]   And then I get in and then I say, okay, at the end of this sentence, cut over to me.
[02:13:22.080 --> 02:13:26.640]   And then they cut over to me and I just keep on going and no one knows.
[02:13:26.640 --> 02:13:30.000]   And this is life hacking at its best.
[02:13:30.000 --> 02:13:31.360]   I have worked this out.
[02:13:32.960 --> 02:13:34.960]   You are the great and prove it.
[02:13:34.960 --> 02:13:36.400]   Always a pleasure to have you on.
[02:13:36.400 --> 02:13:38.400]   And thanks for filling in at the last moment.
[02:13:38.400 --> 02:13:40.480]   We're going to get you out of here in time for the game, right?
[02:13:40.480 --> 02:13:44.400]   Totally my pleasure, Mr. Reports here since Cowboys.
[02:13:44.400 --> 02:13:46.080]   What do they call it?
[02:13:46.080 --> 02:13:47.680]   The fracas in Dallas?
[02:13:47.680 --> 02:13:52.560]   All I know is it's called Sunday night football and I will be watching.
[02:13:52.560 --> 02:13:53.520]   That's all that matters.
[02:13:53.520 --> 02:13:58.640]   But do they finally get Hank Jr. back singing that?
[02:13:58.640 --> 02:14:00.240]   Oh, no.
[02:14:00.240 --> 02:14:00.480]   No.
[02:14:00.480 --> 02:14:01.760]   Those were the good old days.
[02:14:01.760 --> 02:14:05.360]   And they got some winner of Poppy now.
[02:14:05.360 --> 02:14:05.840]   I hate it.
[02:14:05.840 --> 02:14:08.640]   Oh, it's got to be, you know.
[02:14:08.640 --> 02:14:10.240]   Are you ready for some football?
[02:14:10.240 --> 02:14:11.440]   It's like both.
[02:14:11.440 --> 02:14:11.760]   Yeah.
[02:14:11.760 --> 02:14:15.440]   That's Daniel Robino.
[02:14:15.440 --> 02:14:17.360]   He's wondering how he got into this country.
[02:14:17.360 --> 02:14:18.080]   And so are we.
[02:14:18.080 --> 02:14:21.600]   Executive editor at Windows Central.
[02:14:21.600 --> 02:14:24.240]   You can catch Daniel on the Twitter at Daniel underscore.
[02:14:24.240 --> 02:14:26.640]   Robino Ant Pruitt is on the Twitter as well.
[02:14:26.640 --> 02:14:28.960]   Is it Ant underscore Pruitt or just Ant Pruitt?
[02:14:28.960 --> 02:14:30.960]   It is Ant underscore Pruitt.
[02:14:30.960 --> 02:14:32.160]   Both of you are under scores.
[02:14:32.160 --> 02:14:35.840]   Because some turn to get laid in the game.
[02:14:35.840 --> 02:14:38.320]   Oh, you get late in the game late.
[02:14:38.320 --> 02:14:40.480]   How about you Rich D'Amuro?
[02:14:40.480 --> 02:14:41.920]   What's your Twitter handle?
[02:14:41.920 --> 02:14:45.280]   Mine is actually Rich D'Amuro, but I need to switch it to Rich on Tech.
[02:14:45.280 --> 02:14:47.440]   Because that's what I go by on everything else.
[02:14:47.440 --> 02:14:50.240]   So I'm going to have a talk with Twitter soon.
[02:14:50.240 --> 02:14:51.280]   See if I can do that.
[02:14:51.280 --> 02:14:52.880]   Yeah, I do not have a Twitter handle.
[02:14:52.880 --> 02:14:53.680]   Don't tweet me.
[02:14:53.680 --> 02:14:56.240]   Hey, we thank you all for joining us.
[02:14:56.240 --> 02:14:56.880]   We appreciate it.
[02:14:56.880 --> 02:14:58.000]   Thanks to our studio audience.
[02:14:58.000 --> 02:14:59.920]   Noah was here from Cleveland.
[02:14:59.920 --> 02:15:00.720]   We had Bill.
[02:15:00.720 --> 02:15:03.760]   He was visiting from Jacksonville, KW4FD,
[02:15:03.760 --> 02:15:06.720]   73, Doug from Cascade, Iowa.
[02:15:06.720 --> 02:15:08.960]   He took the train out here.
[02:15:08.960 --> 02:15:10.880]   Took the Zephyr, California Zephyr.
[02:15:10.880 --> 02:15:14.240]   Greg, he's from Lake Tahoe.
[02:15:14.240 --> 02:15:14.960]   Hi, Greg.
[02:15:14.960 --> 02:15:15.680]   Great to have you.
[02:15:15.680 --> 02:15:19.840]   And John, who, uh, John used to work at Telltale Games.
[02:15:19.840 --> 02:15:22.560]   Yeah, it's a sad story.
[02:15:22.560 --> 02:15:25.440]   You know, we got to get you on.
[02:15:25.440 --> 02:15:27.680]   I'd love to hear the story of Telltale Games.
[02:15:27.680 --> 02:15:31.200]   They very notably shut their doors a couple of weeks ago.
[02:15:31.200 --> 02:15:35.200]   And everybody suddenly at a work, a lot of them, uh,
[02:15:35.200 --> 02:15:38.480]   so shocked, you know, they couldn't pay their rent.
[02:15:38.480 --> 02:15:39.440]   It was like, what?
[02:15:39.440 --> 02:15:41.360]   Sad story.
[02:15:41.360 --> 02:15:43.440]   There were the ones who did the Walking Dead stories
[02:15:43.440 --> 02:15:44.960]   and they did Minecraft stories.
[02:15:44.960 --> 02:15:46.960]   And everybody thought they're doing great.
[02:15:46.960 --> 02:15:50.560]   Instead, John's stuck here watching Twitter.
[02:15:50.560 --> 02:15:54.320]   We do Twitter every Sunday afternoon.
[02:15:54.320 --> 02:15:57.120]   3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern, 2200 UTC.
[02:15:57.120 --> 02:15:59.440]   If you want to come by and say how you could do it in three different ways,
[02:15:59.440 --> 02:16:02.080]   you can, of course, email tickets at twit.tv.
[02:16:02.080 --> 02:16:03.600]   You got to be in the Northern California area.
[02:16:03.600 --> 02:16:04.560]   Come by Petaluma.
[02:16:04.560 --> 02:16:05.600]   We'll put a CDAP for you.
[02:16:05.600 --> 02:16:06.640]   No charge for that.
[02:16:06.640 --> 02:16:11.840]   You can also watch on our live stream, twit.tv/live.
[02:16:11.840 --> 02:16:14.960]   If you do that, please join the chat room at IRC.twit.tv.
[02:16:14.960 --> 02:16:19.040]   There's a bunch of other people watching live and you can chat with them and have fun.
[02:16:19.040 --> 02:16:21.120]   And of course, if you can't watch live or be here live,
[02:16:21.120 --> 02:16:23.280]   you can always get on demand versions of our show.
[02:16:23.280 --> 02:16:26.640]   Twit.tv is our website. All of our shows are available there.
[02:16:26.640 --> 02:16:28.800]   Audio and video for download.
[02:16:28.800 --> 02:16:31.680]   With the one exception of the Valley of Genius, our new podcast,
[02:16:31.680 --> 02:16:33.840]   which is audio only because it's interviews,
[02:16:33.840 --> 02:16:37.360]   audio interviews with the people who made Silicon Valley great.
[02:16:37.360 --> 02:16:39.600]   And there was just audio.
[02:16:39.600 --> 02:16:42.080]   So no reason to make a video show out of it,
[02:16:42.080 --> 02:16:44.640]   but it's great with Adam Fisher Valley of Genius.
[02:16:44.640 --> 02:16:47.360]   That's our new show, Twit.tv/VOG.

[02:17:03.040 --> 02:17:06.320]   Is there anything else I need to say?
[02:17:06.320 --> 02:17:09.600]   Did I say everything I have to say?
[02:17:09.600 --> 02:17:12.160]   Thanks to all of you for being here.
[02:17:12.160 --> 02:17:13.200]   We had a lot of fun.
[02:17:13.200 --> 02:17:14.000]   Really appreciate it.

[02:17:15.280 --> 02:17:15.680]   - Yeah.
