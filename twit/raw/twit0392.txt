[00:02:17.780 --> 00:02:20.300]   It's time for Twit this weekend tech to show the covers of latest tech news.
[00:02:20.300 --> 00:02:28.420]   We have undoubtedly the most prestigious, the most balanced, the most journalisticy,
[00:02:28.420 --> 00:02:31.020]   adept panel we've ever had on the show.
[00:02:31.020 --> 00:02:32.860]   And I'm just thrilled to have them.
[00:02:32.860 --> 00:02:35.020]   Starting with John C. Devorak, all in plaid.
[00:02:35.020 --> 00:02:36.020]   Good to see you.
[00:02:36.020 --> 00:02:37.020]   You and I are matching.
[00:02:37.020 --> 00:02:38.020]   Lumberjacks today.
[00:02:38.020 --> 00:02:40.260]   And we're okay.
[00:02:40.260 --> 00:02:41.740]   We're okay.
[00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:42.740]   Work all night.
[00:02:42.740 --> 00:02:43.740]   Sleep all day.
[00:02:43.740 --> 00:02:44.740]   Something like that.
[00:02:44.740 --> 00:02:45.740]   Ralph Needleman.
[00:02:45.740 --> 00:02:47.860]   Formally have seen it, but now of ever known.
[00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:48.860]   That's right.
[00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:50.100]   You've crossed over to the dark.
[00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:51.100]   You've meant to ever know?
[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:52.100]   You've gone over to the...
[00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:53.100]   Yeah.
[00:02:53.100 --> 00:02:54.100]   What is your title at the note?
[00:02:54.100 --> 00:02:56.900]   My title is platform advocate.
[00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:57.900]   But I'm also...
[00:02:57.900 --> 00:02:58.900]   Sure, an evangelist.
[00:02:58.900 --> 00:03:02.140]   Yeah, for the API and the platform.
[00:03:02.140 --> 00:03:03.620]   So people can build cool stuff and ever know.
[00:03:03.620 --> 00:03:07.780]   But I'm also writing about startups in a blog called Opportunity Notes.
[00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:09.460]   Oh, I get it.
[00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:10.460]   Not Knox.
[00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:11.460]   Notes.
[00:03:11.460 --> 00:03:12.460]   Notes.
[00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:15.140]   Also with this, the editor in chief, actually managing editor.
[00:03:15.140 --> 00:03:16.140]   What is your title now?
[00:03:16.140 --> 00:03:17.140]   Editorial director.
[00:03:17.140 --> 00:03:18.140]   Editorial director.
[00:03:18.140 --> 00:03:19.140]   Whatever.
[00:03:19.140 --> 00:03:21.300]   Managing editor, editorial director.
[00:03:21.300 --> 00:03:23.340]   Formerly, Macworld alone.
[00:03:23.340 --> 00:03:25.180]   Now your backworld and PC world.
[00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:26.180]   Yep.
[00:03:26.180 --> 00:03:27.180]   Mr. Jason Snell.
[00:03:27.180 --> 00:03:28.180]   It's great to be back.
[00:03:28.180 --> 00:03:29.180]   Do you cover both platforms?
[00:03:29.180 --> 00:03:30.740]   Is there a Linux world?
[00:03:30.740 --> 00:03:32.980]   There used to be, but I think there isn't anymore.
[00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:33.980]   Okay.
[00:03:33.980 --> 00:03:35.180]   But we do have TechHive, which is our sort of general...
[00:03:35.180 --> 00:03:36.180]   Love TechHive.
[00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:37.180]   That's launched now.
[00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:38.180]   I'm really happy about that.
[00:03:38.180 --> 00:03:40.500]   Also with his Ed bot, LoveEd from...
[00:03:40.500 --> 00:03:42.180]   You're in Tucson, right Ed?
[00:03:42.180 --> 00:03:43.180]   Santa Fe, New Mexico.
[00:03:43.180 --> 00:03:44.180]   Santa Fe.
[00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:45.180]   I knew it was something like that.
[00:03:45.180 --> 00:03:49.100]   Speaking of cities that are different from the rest of the United States, I think.
[00:03:49.100 --> 00:03:53.460]   You, you fleeed there from the Bay Area?
[00:03:53.460 --> 00:03:54.460]   No.
[00:03:54.460 --> 00:03:55.460]   Where were you before?
[00:03:55.460 --> 00:03:58.620]   Oh gosh, we've wandered all over the western United States.
[00:03:58.620 --> 00:03:59.620]   Yeah.
[00:03:59.620 --> 00:04:03.180]   We're just trying to find a place where our picture isn't in the post office.
[00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:10.380]   And writes the Ed bot report for ZDNet and covers a lot of window stuff, but you become,
[00:04:10.380 --> 00:04:14.300]   you become like John used to be kind of cantankerous.
[00:04:14.300 --> 00:04:19.060]   Kind of, kind of, you're kind of the, you know, you kind of like tell it as it is.
[00:04:19.060 --> 00:04:20.060]   You're kind of a guy?
[00:04:20.060 --> 00:04:21.060]   Yeah, I guess.
[00:04:21.060 --> 00:04:23.020]   I, you know...
[00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:24.020]   Well I like this one.
[00:04:24.020 --> 00:04:26.220]   Surface Pro versus MacBook Air.
[00:04:26.220 --> 00:04:29.940]   Who's being dishonest with storage space really?
[00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:30.940]   Which is great.
[00:04:30.940 --> 00:04:33.980]   We're going to talk about the Surface Pro, but before we do, it's all about me.
[00:04:33.980 --> 00:04:34.980]   I want to talk about me.
[00:04:34.980 --> 00:04:36.140]   Do you mind?
[00:04:36.140 --> 00:04:37.900]   I was in New Orleans, as you know, John.
[00:04:37.900 --> 00:04:39.980]   I heard this on Sunday.
[00:04:39.980 --> 00:04:44.980]   And I wish I had read this from the Times Picky You in a little column by Jeff Duncan,
[00:04:44.980 --> 00:04:48.540]   a visitor's guide to the New Improved New Orleans for Super Bowl 2013.
[00:04:48.540 --> 00:04:55.460]   A lot of really nice tips about things, you know, to know about and so forth.
[00:04:55.460 --> 00:04:59.700]   And here's the tip that I really, you know, don't drink primary colored drinks, for instance.
[00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:00.700]   Like this red wine?
[00:05:00.700 --> 00:05:01.700]   Yeah.
[00:05:01.700 --> 00:05:03.940]   Like, well a hurricane, right?
[00:05:03.940 --> 00:05:05.860]   Don't drink primary colored drinks.
[00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:06.860]   Yeah.
[00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:07.860]   Don't panic.
[00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:09.940]   If a chicken, a guy in a chicken suit plops down on a bar student next to you, he's probably
[00:05:09.940 --> 00:05:10.940]   the corner attorney.
[00:05:10.940 --> 00:05:14.740]   Go to Tippettina's Rub, Professor Long Hair's Bust.
[00:05:14.740 --> 00:05:18.140]   But this is the one I should have paid more attention to.
[00:05:18.140 --> 00:05:23.700]   Don't answer if someone in the quarters tells you they know where you got dim shoes.
[00:05:23.700 --> 00:05:24.700]   Just keep walking.
[00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:25.700]   You'll thank me later.
[00:05:25.700 --> 00:05:29.980]   Now had I read that, when the guy walked up to me and said, I bet you I know where
[00:05:29.980 --> 00:05:36.180]   you got them shoes, I wouldn't have shaken his hand and said, I bet you don't.
[00:05:36.180 --> 00:05:38.660]   But I did.
[00:05:38.660 --> 00:05:39.660]   And what happens?
[00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:42.100]   He says, you got them on your feet.
[00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.900]   That'll be $20, please.
[00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:46.740]   There's some guy going around town with that gag?
[00:05:46.740 --> 00:05:50.580]   Apparently not so much so that there's, it's in the newspaper.
[00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:51.580]   If I'd only read that.
[00:05:51.580 --> 00:05:53.060]   Anyways, a lot of fun.
[00:05:53.060 --> 00:05:55.180]   Got them on your feet.
[00:05:55.180 --> 00:05:56.420]   Would you have fallen for that?
[00:05:56.420 --> 00:05:57.420]   No.
[00:05:57.420 --> 00:06:02.060]   He then shined my sneakers, which I thought I'm going to pay them $20 not to do.
[00:06:02.060 --> 00:06:06.900]   But I felt he probably felt he should give me something of value for my money.
[00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:07.900]   Cheers.
[00:06:07.900 --> 00:06:10.420]   That probably keeps him from getting arrested.
[00:06:10.420 --> 00:06:14.300]   I don't think anything would keep him from getting arrested had I screamed bloody murder.
[00:06:14.300 --> 00:06:21.060]   But I was just, I feel like as a gentleman, I had shaken on it and I owed him $20.
[00:06:21.060 --> 00:06:22.060]   He was scamming.
[00:06:22.060 --> 00:06:23.900]   And you'd have no idea where his hand was before that.
[00:06:23.900 --> 00:06:26.500]   I can't know, probably on somebody else's shoes.
[00:06:26.500 --> 00:06:27.900]   Surface Pro came out on Friday.
[00:06:27.900 --> 00:06:29.020]   Ed, did you stay up late?
[00:06:29.020 --> 00:06:36.500]   I know that Mary Jo Foley and Paul Therat actually went to the best buy at midnight on Friday.
[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:37.980]   You know, I was invited to that.
[00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:43.020]   But then actually Microsoft wound up canceling an event that they were going to have for
[00:06:43.020 --> 00:06:45.940]   their MVPs there because of Nemo.
[00:06:45.940 --> 00:06:46.940]   Oh, because of Nemo.
[00:06:46.940 --> 00:06:47.940]   Yeah.
[00:06:47.940 --> 00:06:48.940]   And Nemo.
[00:06:48.940 --> 00:06:54.420]   So the Surface RT launch and then Sandy, the Surface Pro launch and then Nemo.
[00:06:54.420 --> 00:06:55.420]   Oh my God.
[00:06:55.420 --> 00:06:59.100]   I'd say if, you know, when it comes to Europe, if you're in London, you know, batten down
[00:06:59.100 --> 00:07:04.060]   the hatches, check the weather forecast because there will be a storm there.
[00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:06.020]   No, I didn't stay up late.
[00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:11.140]   I did get up early the next morning and checked and discovered that the one that I would
[00:07:11.140 --> 00:07:15.180]   have considered ordering was already sold out everywhere.
[00:07:15.180 --> 00:07:17.260]   That's the 128 gigabyte version.
[00:07:17.260 --> 00:07:18.260]   Correct.
[00:07:18.260 --> 00:07:19.260]   Yeah.
[00:07:19.260 --> 00:07:20.260]   Okay.
[00:07:20.260 --> 00:07:22.980]   So at launch February 9th, they were not taking pre-orders unlike the RS.
[00:07:22.980 --> 00:07:28.700]   I bought the Surface RT, the tablet version of this by pre-ordering and got it day and
[00:07:28.700 --> 00:07:30.820]   day, but they weren't doing that.
[00:07:30.820 --> 00:07:36.420]   So people had to go to a store, very few Surface Pro 128s were available.
[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:39.340]   In fact, in some cases, not even many 64 gigs.
[00:07:39.340 --> 00:07:41.860]   What's the story?
[00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:42.860]   I don't know.
[00:07:42.860 --> 00:07:47.420]   I've done a little bit of talking to people about this and it appears that there were
[00:07:47.420 --> 00:07:55.660]   an average of somewhere between three to five units at the Best Buy and Staple stores in
[00:07:55.660 --> 00:07:57.060]   this country.
[00:07:57.060 --> 00:08:04.380]   There were as many as between 20 and 50 per store at the Microsoft stores.
[00:08:04.380 --> 00:08:07.140]   Of course, there's far fewer of those.
[00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:13.820]   So if you do the math there, I figured there were probably in the range, there could have
[00:08:13.820 --> 00:08:18.780]   been maybe 15,000 of them in the channel.
[00:08:18.780 --> 00:08:23.000]   It's interesting because people talk about, well, Microsoft made a big mistake by under
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   supplying these.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:30.440]   But remember, both Best Buy and Staple were the ones who would have had to buy these and
[00:08:30.440 --> 00:08:33.040]   then sell them through.
[00:08:33.040 --> 00:08:38.520]   So it strikes me that they bet conservatively.
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:43.120]   And then the Microsoft stores, they stocked up.
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:44.120]   I don't know.
[00:08:44.120 --> 00:08:48.400]   For a product planner for this, I'm not sure what I would have done.
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:55.200]   The reviews were lukewarm for the device.
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:00.920]   The demand for the Windows RT1 wasn't all that great.
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:03.880]   Microsoft's first foray into hardware.
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:04.880]   No.
[00:09:04.880 --> 00:09:05.880]   No, to computers.
[00:09:05.880 --> 00:09:09.600]   They've obviously done hardware for years, but they've never made computers before.
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:11.960]   They have made prototypes though.
[00:09:11.960 --> 00:09:12.960]   Reference models.
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:13.960]   Yeah.
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:14.960]   And they're first...
[00:09:14.960 --> 00:09:17.960]   They didn't have to make 15,000 reference models.
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:26.040]   Or 50,000 or 200,000 or probably 750,000 or so of the Windows RT units.
[00:09:26.040 --> 00:09:34.400]   And I would imagine that they're planning to make somewhere between 1 million, maybe 2
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:38.120]   million, maybe more of the Surface Pros this year.
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:39.920]   Will they sell that many, you think?
[00:09:39.920 --> 00:09:40.920]   You've reviewed it.
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:44.200]   I'm sure you've looked at it, Jason.
[00:09:44.200 --> 00:09:47.640]   It seems that there are better Windows 8 tablet choices.
[00:09:47.640 --> 00:09:48.640]   It seems that there are.
[00:09:48.640 --> 00:09:51.760]   I mean, that's the thing is it's fascinating to watch Microsoft and wonder what they're
[00:09:51.760 --> 00:09:55.640]   doing strategically, but as a product, you know, there's some interesting innovative
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:09:59.080]   things about it, but I know that, you know, John Phillips, the editor at PC World, spent
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:00.080]   a lot of time with it.
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:03.080]   And he said, you know, it's not that great a tablet.
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:06.720]   It's a better laptop, but there are other really good options for Windows 8.
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:09.080]   The Yoga is a good choice, the ID Padio.
[00:10:09.080 --> 00:10:12.600]   Well, but let's put things into perspective here.
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:20.360]   If you talk about 1 million or 2 million, there are going to be 240 million, at least, Windows
[00:10:20.360 --> 00:10:22.280]   8 devices sold this year.
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:24.120]   That's, you know, that's a drop in the bucket.
[00:10:24.120 --> 00:10:29.680]   That's one half of 1% of the PC market.
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:39.800]   And it is at two pounds with the type covers and with, you know, the kickstand and all
[00:10:39.800 --> 00:10:40.800]   of that.
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:42.000]   It is an innovative device.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   I'm not aware.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:50.520]   The only other device that I'm aware of that has similar specs is the Acer Iconia 700.
[00:10:50.520 --> 00:10:52.400]   That's a beautiful notebook.
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.880]   That's a beautiful little machine.
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:55.360]   Or a tablet, I should say.
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:56.840]   It's not a notebook.
[00:10:56.840 --> 00:11:01.240]   Well, you know, it's sort of, it's one of those hybrid devices because you can, you know,
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:06.520]   you slap it into this little frame there and then it has a keyboard that goes with it.
[00:11:06.520 --> 00:11:08.840]   But that makes it primarily a tablet.
[00:11:08.840 --> 00:11:11.000]   It makes it very hard to be a mobile device.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:16.800]   This thing is an extremely portable device here.
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:17.800]   You asked me.
[00:11:17.800 --> 00:11:18.800]   There it is.
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:19.800]   He got it out of the box.
[00:11:19.800 --> 00:11:22.400]   This was a review unit that was going back.
[00:11:22.400 --> 00:11:23.400]   Yeah.
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:31.200]   And it's, and so here I'll do the, I'll do the, and I have dropped it several times
[00:11:31.200 --> 00:11:35.960]   from 39 inches by accident onto a hard surface and still works.
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:36.960]   Here's the click in.
[00:11:36.960 --> 00:11:38.760]   Can I step on it just to see?
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:39.760]   Put it on your table.
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:42.760]   You can put it on wheels and use it as a skateboard.
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:43.960]   That's what Mr. Sinovsky did.
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:44.960]   That's right.
[00:11:44.960 --> 00:11:45.960]   He did that.
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:49.480]   So here's the, you know, there's the, there's that and then there's the, you know, there's
[00:11:49.480 --> 00:11:50.480]   the type cover.
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:58.400]   But really, I'm not aware of any device that has this much PC power in it that weighs this
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:11:59.400]   little.
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:01.920]   So you recommend it?
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:07.840]   As I said in my review, there is a class of person who will really, really, really gravitate
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:13.400]   towards this device because it is extremely mobile and everything.
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:18.000]   And all of the devices that are coming out here have, have compromises of one sort or
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:19.920]   another with them.
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:25.840]   You know, so you can have light or you can have powerful or you can have a tablet or
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:31.920]   you can have, you know, and everything you can't have at all.
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:32.920]   Yeah.
[00:12:32.920 --> 00:12:36.360]   And, you know, and so this one I think is going to appeal to people who are, first of
[00:12:36.360 --> 00:12:38.280]   all, Microsoft centric.
[00:12:38.280 --> 00:12:43.520]   So if you're in an organization that is, you know, exchange and share point, you're
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:49.520]   going to, you know, you're probably going to find this very friendly towards that.
[00:12:49.520 --> 00:12:55.040]   And, and it also, I think is good because the battery life is, is ultra book class,
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.320]   you know, at, at roughly four hours.
[00:12:57.320 --> 00:12:58.800]   It's a little low, right?
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:13:00.800]   I mean, you would like to see more.
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:04.640]   You would like to see more if you're going to be completely mobile with the device.
[00:13:04.640 --> 00:13:09.960]   But if you're in, if your primary work situation is you're in a corporate office where you're
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:15.840]   going from room to room where there's, you know, there's power and there's Wi-Fi and,
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:16.840]   and such.
[00:13:16.840 --> 00:13:19.720]   And so you're never going to be using it for more than an hour or two without having
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:22.040]   an outlet nearby.
[00:13:22.040 --> 00:13:25.760]   The, the continuous availability of power isn't that big a deal.
[00:13:25.760 --> 00:13:30.600]   So, you know, again, all of those things, when you take it, they narrow down the potential
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:37.600]   market for this to a, to a relatively small number, but a relatively small percentage
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:43.160]   of the Windows 8 market is still a large number in absolute terms.
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:46.880]   And so I think, you know, one million to two million is not an unreasonable number.
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:49.360]   Why does Microsoft make this surface?
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:51.400]   What is the point for Microsoft?
[00:13:51.400 --> 00:13:52.400]   What do they gain?
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:58.000]   I think part of it is to be, is to be a, a hero device, a flagship device to sort of
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:13:59.800]   set this.
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.200]   It's not a reference design.
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:02.200]   It's a hero.
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:03.600]   Is that a different?
[00:14:03.600 --> 00:14:06.160]   They call it a stage for Windows.
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:09.560]   So basically this device has no crap wear on it.
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:10.560]   Right.
[00:14:10.560 --> 00:14:11.560]   None.
[00:14:11.560 --> 00:14:13.800]   I know Microsoft would love manufacturers to do more.
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:16.040]   What they call signature PCs.
[00:14:16.040 --> 00:14:17.680]   So I have nobody will do it.
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:22.480]   I have in my office, which I'm going to be reviewing this week three alternative devices
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:26.320]   that are similar hybrid type devices.
[00:14:26.320 --> 00:14:29.120]   And, you know, I'm not going to name any names right now.
[00:14:29.120 --> 00:14:30.520]   I will later.
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:37.800]   But one of them has so much junk on it, both on the desktop side and on the, on the Windows
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:38.800]   8 tile side.
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:41.520]   You know, you just look at it and you want to cry.
[00:14:41.520 --> 00:14:46.920]   And so part, part of it is that part of it is the build quality of this device.
[00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:54.480]   You know, Jason, I know you can, your reviewer, no doubt had problems with things like battery
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:14:58.720]   life and things like maybe the camera quality and such.
[00:14:58.720 --> 00:15:04.440]   But nobody who has picked up this device that I've given it to has said anything except
[00:15:04.440 --> 00:15:06.440]   wow when it comes to the build quality.
[00:15:06.440 --> 00:15:08.640]   It feels really well built device.
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:09.920]   It doesn't feel cheap at all.
[00:15:09.920 --> 00:15:10.920]   It feels really nice.
[00:15:10.920 --> 00:15:11.920]   There's no doubt about it.
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:15.160]   And I think it's great that Microsoft built this because they are saying this is what
[00:15:15.160 --> 00:15:17.960]   a Windows 8 device can be and a Windows 8 tablet can be.
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:18.960]   How much is it?
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:19.960]   64 gigs is how much?
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:20.960]   Do you remember?
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:21.960]   899.
[00:15:21.960 --> 00:15:23.960]   And then 128 gigs is 999.
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:25.960]   So it's a little pricey.
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:27.480]   I wonder if they're making any money on it.
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:28.480]   I bet they're not making money.
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.480]   I don't think so.
[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:30.480]   I don't know.
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:37.520]   I've seen some breakdowns which show they're getting, you know, a fairly standard PC industry
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:41.280]   margin on it, which is low.
[00:15:41.280 --> 00:15:47.760]   But this is actually, this is fairly competitive with this class of device.
[00:15:47.760 --> 00:15:50.040]   I don't consider this pricey.
[00:15:50.040 --> 00:15:54.480]   The devices that are competitive with it cost around $1,000.
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:59.480]   Remember it has 1920 by 1080 resolution and a digitizer in it.
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:01.000]   It's very high res.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:07.640]   You are not going to find those features in a device that costs less than $1,000.
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:12.600]   Well, let's bring up something here which is Leo's question about why are they doing
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:14.000]   this in the first place.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:18.640]   I'm going to just bring up again my point which is that they're doing it for their stores
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:22.720]   because they have to have something to sell and they intend to follow Apple's strategy
[00:16:22.720 --> 00:16:26.760]   of having a three or four hundred stores around and they need to put something in there.
[00:16:26.760 --> 00:16:30.840]   That's why I will suggest they will also bring out a tower.
[00:16:30.840 --> 00:16:33.320]   They had a Microsoft store at the Sony Metrion.
[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:34.320]   It was ages ago.
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:37.320]   It was terrible because there was nothing.
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:38.320]   They didn't have them.
[00:16:38.320 --> 00:16:39.320]   They didn't have them.
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:41.120]   They had nothing to copy.
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.320]   They had nothing to copy.
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:43.320]   Apple does it.
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:44.320]   Show them how to do it.
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:46.320]   The new stores are much better than that.
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:50.320]   They look just like Apple stores.
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:51.320]   They do.
[00:16:51.320 --> 00:16:56.240]   By the way, Apple has trademarked the trade dress now of the Apple store probably in recent.
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:17:00.040]   Apple has the most sales per square foot of any retail operation in the world.
[00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.440]   Not just computing or retail.
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:02.440]   Not just computing.
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:03.440]   Including Tiffany's.
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:07.840]   Microsoft took one look at that and said, "Why aren't we doing this?"
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:11.520]   It's only 100 bucks more for the 128 gig service.
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:14.320]   I'm trying to buy it out of stock.
[00:17:14.320 --> 00:17:16.040]   This is at the Microsoft online store.
[00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:18.240]   You won't let me select the radio button.
[00:17:18.240 --> 00:17:23.960]   It's not only out of stock, but you can't even pre-order this for some date in the future.
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:25.520]   You sold all the radio buttons.
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:27.520]   The radio buttons are sold out as well as...
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:29.520]   Maybe they just made one run.
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:30.840]   Why would you do that?
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:31.840]   You made one run.
[00:17:31.840 --> 00:17:37.520]   Apple actually, Microsoft actually underestimated demand for their own computer.
[00:17:37.520 --> 00:17:41.560]   That's a pretty sad commentary on the state of affairs for the rest of the EC industry.
[00:17:41.560 --> 00:17:43.560]   Well, nerve-ass to great question in the chat room.
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:46.160]   Why is Microsoft so bearish on its own hardware?
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:47.160]   Exactly.
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.840]   Shouldn't they be making up?
[00:17:48.840 --> 00:17:51.640]   Maybe because this is just a dry run for something they're going to bring out later
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:54.160]   and they don't want to just get everyone caught up on this thing.
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:55.640]   Why are you just before then?
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:59.240]   By the way, both the RT and the pro are not the real versions.
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:01.320]   That there will be a real version soon.
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:05.160]   I wouldn't be surprised, but you have to remember when IBM was doing its think pads,
[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:06.800]   they would do one run of every...
[00:18:06.800 --> 00:18:08.760]   They would estimate how many people were going to buy.
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:11.080]   They'd do one run and go on to the next model.
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:12.080]   And this may be the policy...
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:13.080]   That's it.
[00:18:13.080 --> 00:18:14.080]   They don't make any more.
[00:18:14.080 --> 00:18:15.080]   Right.
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:16.080]   That's it.
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.080]   So I have to buy...
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:18.080]   Now, here's the question.
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:22.220]   And Ed, you respond to this a little bit because significant amount, around 30 to 40
[00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:26.680]   gigs of space is taken up by the operating system, the restore partition and so forth.
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:28.520]   So people are complaining, especially on the 64.
[00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:31.880]   Hey, we're not getting a whole lot of free space on here.
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:36.040]   And Ed, you responded to this, of course, saying it's not just Microsoft.
[00:18:36.040 --> 00:18:37.040]   Great.
[00:18:37.040 --> 00:18:47.040]   Yeah, the MacBook Air and the Surface Pro are almost twins when it comes to the amount
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:55.320]   of free space that's left after you configure the 128 gigabyte device.
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:19:02.160]   And then especially if you use the built-in utility in Windows 8 and copy the recovery
[00:19:02.160 --> 00:19:07.240]   partition to a USB flash drive so you can have that 8 gigabytes back.
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:10.920]   When you do that, they both have somewhere...
[00:19:10.920 --> 00:19:16.040]   And again, and now you have to compare them using the same terms.
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:24.400]   So if you use Apple's measurements, you have somewhere between 104 and 106 gigabytes of
[00:19:24.400 --> 00:19:29.840]   free space on a device that is advertised with 128 gigs.
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:30.840]   That's not bad.
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:32.600]   That's not bad at all.
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:37.000]   On the 64 gig though, it looks a little light.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:42.480]   On the 64 gig, again, if you measure it using 64 gigs is in decimal.
[00:19:42.480 --> 00:19:49.640]   So if you measure it in decimal, what you have is 32 gigabytes of free space and then
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:52.440]   you have the 8 gigabyte recovery.
[00:19:52.440 --> 00:19:53.440]   So I can get 40 gigs.
[00:19:53.440 --> 00:19:54.440]   Which you can remove.
[00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:55.440]   So you get 40 gigs.
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:59.440]   Not a MacBook Air, it's around 45, I believe.
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:01.440]   So the thing is...
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:05.240]   There is one difference which is I can get a bigger drive in my Air.
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:09.040]   At this point, can only get 64 gigs in a Surface Pro.
[00:20:09.040 --> 00:20:10.040]   Period.
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:11.800]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:17.240]   And so there's a customization option that's available for Microsoft in the future.
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:23.400]   I think actually they ought to feel pretty optimistic about the response from this weekend
[00:20:23.400 --> 00:20:25.040]   and maybe they'll ramp up production.
[00:20:25.040 --> 00:20:37.760]   Maybe this was better to sell out and then be able to deliver on it later than to have
[00:20:37.760 --> 00:20:42.840]   stores filled with pallets of merchandise that just sits there for weeks.
[00:20:42.840 --> 00:20:44.480]   And Deeter-Monkey does have a very good point.
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:47.640]   There is an SD card slot in the Microsoft Surface Pro.
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:48.640]   There's a new stand-use.
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:53.440]   You can put 64 gigabytes in there now and you'll be able to put 128 gigabytes in there
[00:20:53.440 --> 00:20:54.440]   next week.
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:59.280]   So the question that people have been asking me all week is why do Apple and Microsoft
[00:20:59.280 --> 00:21:03.360]   even sell the 64 gigabyte models?
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:08.280]   And I've been thinking about this and there's actually a really good answer to this.
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:14.600]   Two years ago, 64 gigabyte device was a terrible idea.
[00:21:14.600 --> 00:21:15.600]   Today...
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:16.600]   Because it's loud.
[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:20.840]   Especially next year and the year after that, it's going to be...
[00:21:20.840 --> 00:21:26.360]   This is basically going to be what the Chromebook should be.
[00:21:26.360 --> 00:21:30.360]   Anybody who likes the Chromebook but objects to the fact that they can't run...
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:35.320]   They can't put things that don't run in a browser on it should say, "Well, okay, this
[00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:38.320]   is not a bad thing at all."
[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:44.160]   In a cloud, in a world where you're going to have most of your stuff in the cloud anyway,
[00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:49.480]   and it's a companion device that you're going to use and then you're going to bring it back
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:57.400]   to your home or your office or whatever and sync it up with the cloud, 64 gigs seems basically
[00:21:57.400 --> 00:21:58.400]   okay.
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:21:59.400]   There may be another reason.
[00:21:59.400 --> 00:22:00.400]   Dan Ariele talks about...
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:01.400]   It's not going to be okay for us.
[00:22:01.400 --> 00:22:04.200]   It's not going to be okay for anyone in this room because we're all...
[00:22:04.200 --> 00:22:05.400]   There may be another reason.
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:09.840]   Dan Ariele and predictably irrational calls get the decoy effect and it's often used
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:12.320]   in pricing where you do three prices.
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:16.040]   You do a low price that nobody wants but it makes the middle price look better.
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:17.040]   The monster cable effect.
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:18.040]   Yeah.
[00:22:18.040 --> 00:22:19.040]   Yeah.
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:23.640]   I think there's a flaw in this which is you don't have any 128 gig surface pros.
[00:22:23.640 --> 00:22:25.680]   You're stuck with the decoy.
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:27.160]   I think it's important to...
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:31.020]   Ed's whole approach this week which was right on to say that if you compare it to the Mac
[00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:32.920]   Book Air it has similar storage characteristics.
[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:38.960]   I think what's interesting is people have to think of this as a PC and not as an iPad
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:43.160]   because the storage math is different when you're not about a tablet.
[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:44.160]   It's not a tablet.
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.160]   It's a PC.
[00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:48.800]   It's a Windows APC and it behaves very much like the Mac Book Air does in terms of how
[00:22:48.800 --> 00:22:49.800]   it handles storage with a...
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:50.800]   You know you put local storage.
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:51.800]   Yeah exactly.
[00:22:51.800 --> 00:22:52.800]   You have access to it.
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:53.800]   There's a file system.
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:54.800]   That's why I have all that power.
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:55.800]   You know.
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:22:58.800]   You can do stuff that you're not going to do with local data.
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:22:59.800]   We're going to take a break.
[00:22:59.800 --> 00:23:02.800]   When I come back, you know, more and more I'm hearing especially from people in our chat
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:05.720]   room that they are not using Windows 8 as intended.
[00:23:05.720 --> 00:23:07.800]   They're actually running various utilities.
[00:23:07.800 --> 00:23:08.800]   Some freeze some not.
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:12.280]   Turning it into a Windows 7 desktop machine without Metro there.
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:14.800]   They're going to the classic mode.
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:19.920]   And I'm curious about that I want to ask Ed and John, Jason and Rafe.
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:20.920]   We've got a great panel for you.
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:23.120]   We're talking about tech.
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:24.120]   Lots more and a little later on.
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:26.680]   We're going to create a viral video right here on this show.
[00:23:26.680 --> 00:23:28.160]   So you're going to want to stay tuned.
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:30.200]   That's why I've got the Beyonce finger lasers on.
[00:23:30.200 --> 00:23:31.200]   I'm ready.
[00:23:31.200 --> 00:23:34.120]   You want to stay tuned for that.
[00:23:34.120 --> 00:23:35.520]   What do you look at me like that for?
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:36.520]   They're not lasers.
[00:23:36.520 --> 00:23:37.520]   They're not lasers.
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:38.520]   They're LEDs.
[00:23:38.520 --> 00:23:40.400]   I choose to think of them as lasers.
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.440]   Well God thank God they're not.
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:43.440]   Can you imagine?
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:44.440]   I'd be shy of these.
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:46.320]   Oh no it is a Super Bowl.
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:48.920]   This whole table would be destroyed now.
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:53.640]   We had a little accident, a pre-show accident where I actually broke the table we're sitting
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:54.640]   at.
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:55.640]   When did that happen?
[00:23:55.640 --> 00:23:56.640]   I got up on top of it.
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:58.240]   It was kind of a mistake.
[00:23:58.240 --> 00:24:01.720]   And people can't see it right now although I imagine you guys have already tweeted it.
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:03.720]   Oh there's a YouTube video out there.
[00:24:03.720 --> 00:24:04.720]   Are you breaking the table?
[00:24:04.720 --> 00:24:06.720]   You already have video of me breaking the table?
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:07.720]   It's racking it up.
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:08.720]   Primonately.
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:11.800]   Oh no this is going to be bigger than our viral video.
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:12.800]   The table has a different number.
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:13.800]   There's a Weight Watchers ad here.
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:14.800]   And it goes.
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:15.800]   Oh no watch out.
[00:24:15.800 --> 00:24:17.800]   No no no get on there Leo.
[00:24:17.800 --> 00:24:18.800]   What are you crazy?
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:19.800]   Oh no geez.
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:22.600]   That's terrible.
[00:24:22.600 --> 00:24:28.040]   And you're right there is a twitter roundtable twitter account.
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:30.080]   And it's only got one tweet.
[00:24:30.080 --> 00:24:32.080]   Ow.
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:33.240]   It's probably a short-lived account.
[00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:34.240]   It works fast.
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:35.760]   The net does not sleep.
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:36.760]   It never sleeps.
[00:24:36.760 --> 00:24:38.200]   And neither does our fine audience.
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:41.560]   Our show today brought to you by our friends at audible.com.
[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:44.240]   The world's greatest audio bookstore show of hands.
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.200]   I'm just curious I don't know.
[00:24:46.200 --> 00:24:48.200]   Audio listeners here.
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:49.200]   Audible books.
[00:24:49.200 --> 00:24:50.200]   Yeah you a little bit.
[00:24:50.200 --> 00:24:51.200]   Yeah.
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:52.200]   Yeah.
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:53.200]   You don't travel.
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:54.200]   You don't have a commute.
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:56.200]   And you probably don't have time to listen to audio books.
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:57.640]   Yeah I commute about 10 feet.
[00:24:57.640 --> 00:24:58.640]   Yeah.
[00:24:58.640 --> 00:24:59.640]   It's really great if you commute.
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:00.640]   In fact that's when I found audible.
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:05.240]   In the year 2000 when I was driving back and forth from Petaluma San Francisco for tech
[00:25:05.240 --> 00:25:06.240]   TV.
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:07.240]   But I can't stop now.
[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:08.240]   I just love it.
[00:25:08.240 --> 00:25:10.160]   I've listened to more than 500 books on audible.com.
[00:25:10.160 --> 00:25:12.000]   Including the one I just mentioned.
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:13.760]   Predictably irrational which is a wonderful book.
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:17.840]   We interviewed Dan Ariele on triangulation.
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:24.440]   And I just love this idea that you can use economic theory to analyze people's behavior.
[00:25:24.440 --> 00:25:27.200]   It's about the hidden forces that shape our decisions.
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:32.560]   Including that decoy effect used by marketers and catalog authors everywhere to create demand
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:34.360]   for a price.
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:36.800]   If you give people two prices.
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:37.800]   They go I don't know.
[00:25:37.800 --> 00:25:38.800]   I don't know.
[00:25:38.800 --> 00:25:43.840]   But I think that's one that's just ridiculous.
[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:45.960]   But just for a little bit more you can get a lot better.
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:46.960]   It's very interesting.
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:47.960]   Anyway great book.
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:48.960]   Highly recommend it.
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.160]   Tell you what you can get two books for free.
[00:25:50.160 --> 00:25:53.520]   This could be one of them.
[00:25:53.520 --> 00:25:54.360]   So many good choices.
[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:57.680]   How about the John you'd love this.
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:59.440]   Janice Ian's autobiography.
[00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:01.440]   Society's child.
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:04.200]   I'll skip it.
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:05.200]   I'll skip it.
[00:26:05.200 --> 00:26:06.960]   But you know if you were an Ann and Nancy Wilson fan.
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:07.960]   If you're a fan of art.
[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:08.960]   Janice Ian died recently.
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:09.960]   No no she's still here.
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:11.320]   She's still with us.
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:12.320]   She learned the truth.
[00:26:12.320 --> 00:26:14.080]   It was I think in Laura Nero as well.
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:15.080]   Did she pass?
[00:26:15.080 --> 00:26:16.080]   Yeah.
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:17.080]   Great singer.
[00:26:17.080 --> 00:26:18.080]   Hearts story.
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:19.080]   Kicking and dreaming.
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:21.600]   A story of heart, soul and rock and roll by Ann and Nancy Wilson.
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:22.600]   And they narrate it.
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:24.240]   Now that's awesome.
[00:26:24.240 --> 00:26:25.240]   Audio books could be that.
[00:26:25.240 --> 00:26:29.480]   But they can also be history, science fiction, thrillers.
[00:26:29.480 --> 00:26:30.480]   Just pardon me?
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:31.480]   You're darn right.
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:32.480]   You don't.
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:33.480]   You're not the rook.
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:34.480]   You're not the rook.
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:35.480]   Look it up.
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:36.480]   What's the rook?
[00:26:36.480 --> 00:26:37.480]   I'm a fan of the fave.
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:38.480]   You should check it out.
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:26:39.480]   Daniel O'Malley.
[00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:41.480]   A novel by Daniel O'Malley narrated by Susan Darden.
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:45.560]   It's like British bureaucracy except they've got superpowers like X-Men like it's pretty
[00:26:45.560 --> 00:26:46.560]   awesome.
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:47.560]   Dude.
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:48.560]   Check it out.
[00:26:48.560 --> 00:26:49.560]   Why don't you tell me about this sooner?
[00:26:49.560 --> 00:26:50.560]   I told you.
[00:26:50.560 --> 00:26:51.560]   This is a dude.
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:52.560]   Dude.
[00:26:52.560 --> 00:26:53.560]   Dude.
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:54.560]   The rook.
[00:26:54.560 --> 00:26:55.560]   Check it out.
[00:26:55.560 --> 00:26:56.560]   I'm channeling Brushwood.
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:26:57.560]   So here's this is beautiful.
[00:26:57.560 --> 00:26:58.560]   Look it.
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:26:59.560]   We got a couple of books already.
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:02.640]   Here's the you'll go to audible.com/twit2 you get two books free.
[00:27:02.640 --> 00:27:03.960]   You'll be signing up for the platinum account.
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:05.120]   That's the two book a month account.
[00:27:05.120 --> 00:27:06.120]   The first month is free.
[00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:07.120]   The first two books are free.
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:08.600]   You can cancel in the first month.
[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:09.600]   Pay nothing.
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:10.600]   Keep those books.
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:11.600]   The rook.
[00:27:11.600 --> 00:27:12.600]   I'm adding it to let's see do I have a credit?
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:13.600]   I do.
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:15.560]   I'm going to buy this sucker right now.
[00:27:15.560 --> 00:27:16.560]   You like it huh?
[00:27:16.560 --> 00:27:17.560]   Yeah.
[00:27:17.560 --> 00:27:18.560]   Really good.
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:19.560]   I love the idea of superpowers.
[00:27:19.560 --> 00:27:20.560]   Are you feigning?
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:21.560]   Feigning?
[00:27:21.560 --> 00:27:23.720]   Feigning the fact that you probably get all these books for free.
[00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:24.720]   No, no, no.
[00:27:24.720 --> 00:27:26.360]   I pay for an honorable account.
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:27.280]   What do you mean get these for free?
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:28.280]   How would I get them for free?
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:29.280]   Yeah.
[00:27:29.280 --> 00:27:30.280]   Have an audiobook.
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:31.440]   It's yours free kid.
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:32.440]   Just write nice things about it.
[00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:34.680]   You do the same thing if you go to the right web page.
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:37.800]   You get two free books if you type in the code or whatever you do.
[00:27:37.800 --> 00:27:38.800]   You could do it.
[00:27:38.800 --> 00:27:40.800]   You're even better than Leo.
[00:27:40.800 --> 00:27:43.760]   Audible.com/twit2 because I already have an account.
[00:27:43.760 --> 00:27:45.520]   I just told you I haven't had accounts since the year.
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:47.000]   They don't give you a discount.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   No.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   After all the work you do for them.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   You're almost to be on the board of directors.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   I am not.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:56.040]   I find that to be unbelievable.
[00:27:56.040 --> 00:27:57.440]   I know.
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:27:58.440]   I know.
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:00.080]   I should be getting free stuff galore.
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:02.480]   But I have there's this little thing called ethics John.
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:07.120]   What ethics you still you might as well be on the board of directors.
[00:28:07.120 --> 00:28:08.680]   You love this company.
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:11.960]   They actually when I went out to audible a few years ago went out to visit him in Newark
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:14.640]   and they did they said that they said you want to be on the board of directors.
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:15.640]   We love you.
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:18.160]   They said exactly those words and then they said see you later.
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:19.160]   Bye bye.
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:20.160]   They never invited you.
[00:28:20.160 --> 00:28:21.160]   Nice to have you.
[00:28:21.160 --> 00:28:22.160]   No.
[00:28:22.160 --> 00:28:23.160]   They probably do that with all visitors.
[00:28:23.160 --> 00:28:24.160]   They do.
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:25.160]   Audible.com/twit2.
[00:28:25.160 --> 00:28:26.160]   I admit it.
[00:28:26.160 --> 00:28:30.000]   I'm a big fan and I highly recommend it.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:37.400]   The Audible app is great on Windows Phone Metro but also Android and iPhone.
[00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:39.640]   Really a great way to have your whole library available to you.
[00:28:39.640 --> 00:28:41.600]   Listen anywhere everywhere.
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:43.120]   I have a Sonos system.
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:45.040]   I have a playing through my Sonos throughout my house.
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:48.040]   So I'm doing the chores and chores in my book.
[00:28:48.040 --> 00:28:49.040]   Yeah I do chores.
[00:28:49.040 --> 00:28:50.040]   What about the butler and the maid?
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:51.040]   Well they don't.
[00:28:51.040 --> 00:28:52.040]   They do anything.
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:55.880]   You know I used to let them churn the butter but they just don't do it right.
[00:28:55.880 --> 00:28:57.200]   And so I have to do it myself.
[00:28:57.200 --> 00:28:59.160]   Silver lining playbook.
[00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:02.560]   Apparently I like the movie but apparently the novels even better.
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:04.080]   Matthew Quick.
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:07.080]   Some great choices at Audible.audible.com/twit2.
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:09.080]   Thank them for their support when you're there.
[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.080]   Say thank you.
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:11.240]   You should put Leo on the board.
[00:29:11.240 --> 00:29:13.080]   I don't want to be on anybody's board of directors.
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:14.080]   You're on this board.
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:15.080]   But it's a good board.
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:16.080]   Aren't you on a board here?
[00:29:16.080 --> 00:29:17.080]   We don't have a board.
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:18.080]   It's a sole proprietorship.
[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:19.080]   Oh, I am the dictator.
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:20.080]   I am the board.
[00:29:20.080 --> 00:29:21.080]   You are the board.
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:22.080]   I am the board.
[00:29:22.080 --> 00:29:23.080]   You are the fruit squad.
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:24.080]   I am.
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:27.720]   So Windows 8.
[00:29:27.720 --> 00:29:30.080]   Let me ask you, do you like Ed Bot?
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:31.680]   You probably used it more than anybody here.
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:33.680]   Do you like the Metro?
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:37.320]   Are you the classic kind of guy?
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:38.320]   You know it's interesting.
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:39.320]   I got an email.
[00:29:39.320 --> 00:29:41.160]   I don't know if you remember Woody Leonard.
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:42.160]   Oh yeah.
[00:29:42.160 --> 00:29:47.520]   Woody and I used to write books together and now he lives in Thailand and writes a column
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:49.440]   for Computer World.
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:50.440]   That's nice.
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:51.440]   I think.
[00:29:51.440 --> 00:29:55.560]   And he asked me that exact same question this morning.
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:58.920]   And I thought long and hard about it.
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:02.160]   And so yes, I do like Windows 8.
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:04.920]   I like it a lot for two reasons.
[00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:11.000]   Number one, the performance improvements over any previous version of Windows are just worth
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:12.400]   it.
[00:30:12.400 --> 00:30:17.480]   And number two, the ability to sync all of your settings and files and apps and stuff
[00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:18.840]   across multiple devices.
[00:30:18.840 --> 00:30:22.200]   So when I set up a new device, boom, all of my stuff is there.
[00:30:22.200 --> 00:30:26.520]   I have very, very little work that I need to do to get it working.
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:28.600]   That's transformational also.
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:32.120]   The act of setting up a new PC is not painful anymore.
[00:30:32.120 --> 00:30:36.280]   I do like being able to log into my Microsoft account and it's all set up.
[00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:37.520]   I do like that.
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:42.040]   So I use, so of course I use a fair number of desktop apps.
[00:30:42.040 --> 00:30:44.400]   Microsoft Office is still a desktop app.
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:50.040]   But on this PC that I'm using right now, which has, I'm sorry, a pretty crappy webcam
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:51.560]   in it.
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:57.960]   But I'm using the Metro version of Skype and I have a Twitro plus.
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:31:00.400]   So you like Metro apps?
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:01.400]   Over on the side.
[00:31:01.400 --> 00:31:02.400]   They're great.
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:09.560]   I have something snap to the side of my screen all the time when I'm working.
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:15.920]   Even when I'm working on the desktop, I usually have either mail messaging or Twitter snap
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:18.760]   to the side in a Metro app.
[00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:24.040]   And it works so much better than trying to arrange conventional desktop windows.
[00:31:24.040 --> 00:31:27.520]   Did it take you a while to get used to?
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:31.560]   It took me a little while to get used to, not as long as all that.
[00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:38.440]   But then again, like so many people who are in the situation that I'm in, we're beta testing
[00:31:38.440 --> 00:31:41.160]   stuff, we tend to live in the future.
[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:46.360]   And so I'm living, I've been living in the future as far as Windows 8 is concerned.
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:52.800]   The real problem was that it's taken a while for good apps to come along.
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:58.080]   And there's still not enough good modern UI style apps.
[00:31:58.080 --> 00:31:59.360]   Twitro plus is a really good one.
[00:31:59.360 --> 00:32:00.960]   There's one called Feed Reader.
[00:32:00.960 --> 00:32:05.960]   I want to give Sam, Sam, who's the author of that, I want to give him a plug here.
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:13.880]   And everyone should go out and buy that app because it's a great Google Reader client.
[00:32:13.880 --> 00:32:21.720]   And so you can have your Google Reader feed, RSS feeds in a Metro style app.
[00:32:21.720 --> 00:32:24.680]   That's a really good one.
[00:32:24.680 --> 00:32:30.920]   The news apps that come with Windows 8, the Bing apps, news and sports, those are great.
[00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:33.000]   They're really well designed.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:43.760]   But I spend probably, I'd say 70 to 80% of my time in the Windows desktop because that's
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:45.880]   where that's where Office is.
[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:50.080]   But that might change over time as more Metro apps come out and so forth.
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:52.600]   This is a marathon, not a sprint.
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:56.200]   Classic shell, a lot of people have been telling me that this is a free app that basically
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:58.720]   turns off the Metro and turns on the desktop.
[00:32:58.720 --> 00:32:59.720]   What is this?
[00:32:59.720 --> 00:33:00.720]   There are a number of these.
[00:33:00.720 --> 00:33:02.640]   Yeah, I wonder if Microsoft will make that.
[00:33:02.640 --> 00:33:04.360]   Yeah, why isn't there a checkbox?
[00:33:04.360 --> 00:33:06.800]   I tell you why, because they're all in on Metro.
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:08.160]   They want to force this issue.
[00:33:08.160 --> 00:33:09.880]   They don't want to give you a backdoor.
[00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:12.080]   No, they want everybody in the new system.
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:13.080]   They want everybody that way.
[00:33:13.080 --> 00:33:14.080]   Why?
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:18.200]   But there are at least five different alternatives for that.
[00:33:18.200 --> 00:33:20.000]   That's always been the way the Windows is.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:21.200]   You want that feature?
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:22.200]   Do it.
[00:33:22.200 --> 00:33:23.960]   You want an alternative file explorer?
[00:33:23.960 --> 00:33:24.960]   Do it.
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:33.680]   There's like 15 different desktop style file explorers out there if you want that capability.
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:40.640]   One thing that I really appreciate that they've done with Windows 8 is to not do the click
[00:33:40.640 --> 00:33:43.440]   a checkbox and have one of four different options here.
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:48.120]   They said this is the interface and there's also an API where if you want to do things
[00:33:48.120 --> 00:33:53.080]   differently, use a third party app and do it.
[00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:54.520]   What people hate change though, right?
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:56.160]   I mean, isn't that the bottom line?
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:57.160]   It's difficult.
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:33:58.840]   People hate change and I understand why they hate it.
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:00.280]   Let's face reality about this.
[00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:01.680]   We don't want full screen.
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:03.320]   Most people have big monitors.
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:07.200]   We don't want a full screen app on a 30 inch monitor or something like that.
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:09.040]   You have this huge app.
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:10.040]   It's ludicrous.
[00:34:10.040 --> 00:34:16.440]   I mean, yeah, on surface tablets, laptops, I could see especially where they had a touchscreen
[00:34:16.440 --> 00:34:17.440]   or any touchscreen device.
[00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:18.960]   Yeah, it makes some sense.
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:22.040]   But on a big giant, you got two 29 inches right there.
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:25.920]   Next thing, boom, you got this whole thing chewed up by one giant app.
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:26.920]   It stinks.
[00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:29.680]   That's why I don't use full screen mode on Mountland.
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:30.680]   Mac has the same issue.
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:31.680]   My big screen is the same thing.
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:34.920]   It's, you know, you go in that I have two monitors and the second monitor just gets
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:36.720]   the linen texture on the big Apple completely.
[00:34:36.720 --> 00:34:37.720]   It's so horrible.
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:38.720]   Just like forget it.
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:39.720]   You don't want to just handle it.
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:40.720]   It's terrible.
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:41.720]   I'm only 11 inch laptop.
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:42.720]   It's fine.
[00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:44.720]   Yeah, they're fundamentally different experiences.
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:47.360]   So this is my work machine.
[00:34:47.360 --> 00:34:49.160]   It's the little screen, which is one thing.
[00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:52.880]   And then I plug it into the giant display when I go to work and it transforms it.
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:55.920]   It's a very different work experience.
[00:34:55.920 --> 00:35:00.640]   The metro interface is, like you said, it's kind of cool on a single, smallish device.
[00:35:00.640 --> 00:35:07.080]   But also, how many people use a touchscreen like a, of this way, a touchscreen, a vertical
[00:35:07.080 --> 00:35:08.080]   touchscreen?
[00:35:08.080 --> 00:35:09.080]   Does that actually work?
[00:35:09.080 --> 00:35:10.080]   You're not sure.
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:11.080]   What do you mean?
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:12.080]   No, it's just a perpendicular keyboard.
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:16.560]   A giant monitor with a touchscreen.
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:18.400]   Oh, like that crazy Sony thing?
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:19.400]   That's a table?
[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:20.400]   No, no, no, no.
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:21.400]   That's the way the future.
[00:35:21.400 --> 00:35:23.040]   I mean, all monitors will be touchscreen pretty soon enough.
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:26.280]   Well, I do think you should, if you're getting Windows 8, get a touchscreen, right?
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:27.280]   You would agree with that.
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:28.680]   Yes, what it's made for.
[00:35:28.680 --> 00:35:29.680]   Yeah.
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:33.800]   I find the laptops without touch screens to be very frustrating on Windows 8.
[00:35:33.800 --> 00:35:38.880]   I'm actually using the laptop that I'm using right here is one without a touchscreen.
[00:35:38.880 --> 00:35:41.880]   It has the touchpad drivers.
[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:43.960]   Yeah, so you're used to it is what you're saying.
[00:35:43.960 --> 00:35:47.480]   You figured it out, like charms and you know all the keystrokes and everything.
[00:35:47.480 --> 00:35:49.720]   It's not keystrokes, Leo.
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:50.720]   The touchpad.
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:51.720]   It's touching.
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:57.840]   Actually, if you swipe in from the right side of the touchpad, it's the same thing as swiping
[00:35:57.840 --> 00:36:01.160]   in from the right side of the touchscreen.
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:04.640]   If you swipe in from the left side, it switches between your apps.
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:09.840]   If you swipe down from the top, it gives you the app bar for your...
[00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:12.520]   And that's how you do it.
[00:36:12.520 --> 00:36:14.080]   You like to do it that way.
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:16.320]   That's how you do it.
[00:36:16.320 --> 00:36:20.480]   On this particular machine, it works pretty well.
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:25.360]   I also have a couple of touchscreen laptops here.
[00:36:25.360 --> 00:36:28.920]   And those work really, really well.
[00:36:28.920 --> 00:36:37.040]   I wrote a post about a month ago about this whole gorilla arm thing.
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:45.160]   I'll tell you, if you use Windows 8 on a touchscreen laptop, the amount of space between
[00:36:45.160 --> 00:36:51.880]   the keyboard and the screen is about here this much.
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:55.360]   It's maybe three or four inches.
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:57.360]   You can reach out and do things.
[00:36:57.360 --> 00:37:04.040]   So, what I've discovered in using maybe eight or ten different devices, which have touch
[00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:12.560]   screens, touch enabled trackpads with the support gestures and such keyboards and mice, is that
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:17.000]   you wind up using all of those input things.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:20.800]   The mistake that people tend to make is that they think a touchscreen is the only way to
[00:37:20.800 --> 00:37:22.400]   interact with Windows 8.
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:25.040]   No, it's another way to interact with it.
[00:37:25.040 --> 00:37:26.400]   I would agree with you on that.
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:30.840]   But I think when you don't have the touch screen, I find myself touching the screen a
[00:37:30.840 --> 00:37:31.840]   lot.
[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:34.280]   That's the problem is we'll get used to doing these gestures and then when they're not
[00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:35.280]   there, it's upsetting.
[00:37:35.280 --> 00:37:36.280]   Right.
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:37.720]   That's trying to shift an automatic car.
[00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:38.720]   That's right.
[00:37:38.720 --> 00:37:39.720]   That's right.
[00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:42.360]   Oh, that was a minute.
[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:47.120]   Most people aren't like us and most people don't have an office full of different devices
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:48.120]   that they're kind of just one.
[00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:49.800]   They have just one and so they get used to how it works.
[00:37:49.800 --> 00:37:53.360]   I bet you a lot of people have tablets though, as well as a flat-type smartphone.
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:54.360]   Yeah, sure.
[00:37:54.360 --> 00:37:55.440]   So they're used to touching.
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:59.600]   And little kids who are just not used to using anything but a touch device these days.
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:01.120]   That explains all the fingerprints on my computer.
[00:38:01.120 --> 00:38:05.760]   Okay, so all of you guys have, I'm looking at all the Apple, the shiny Apple logos there.
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:11.000]   So all of you guys have an iPad and you have a MacBook Pro or a MacBook Air.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:16.720]   You're not frustrated and confused, Jason, by switching back and forth between those?
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:21.520]   I'm not, but I will say that my wife who's got a MacBook Air and an iPad, she said since
[00:38:21.520 --> 00:38:23.920]   she got her MacBook Air, she finds herself.
[00:38:23.920 --> 00:38:25.840]   And not with an iMac, but with her laptop.
[00:38:25.840 --> 00:38:30.600]   She now will often be trying to do some swipe gestures and tapping on the smartphone.
[00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:31.920]   It's a magic and a windy thing.
[00:38:31.920 --> 00:38:32.920]   It just has to remember.
[00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:33.920]   I don't do that.
[00:38:33.920 --> 00:38:34.920]   That is pretty much the same.
[00:38:34.920 --> 00:38:36.160]   It's not the end of the world.
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:37.160]   You're right.
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:42.000]   That's especially true when you're using a browser-based app or one of the full-screen
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:49.680]   things in Mountain Lion, the Mission Control and all that stuff where it feels very iPad-like.
[00:38:49.680 --> 00:38:53.760]   And there's big targets out there that just say, "Touch me."
[00:38:53.760 --> 00:38:56.720]   And then you do it and all you do is get the screen dirty.
[00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:57.720]   That's the danger.
[00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:00.520]   If you mix the metaphors, if you have the same metaphors, which is obviously what Apple
[00:39:00.520 --> 00:39:05.560]   and Microsoft are both doing, and if you mix them, but the input mechanisms don't match,
[00:39:05.560 --> 00:39:06.560]   it gets really weird.
[00:39:06.560 --> 00:39:10.040]   I don't think it is transitional.
[00:39:10.040 --> 00:39:12.040]   I think it is transitional.
[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:13.040]   It's messy.
[00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:14.040]   I don't think you...
[00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:18.920]   Certainly Apple doesn't seem to believe that touchscreen is the dominant interaction,
[00:39:18.920 --> 00:39:21.640]   although the trackpad has a lot of the same gesture.
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:23.160]   Same thing where you can sweep in.
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:28.000]   But as an additional gesture, it's not unreasonable at all because I know, having seen that in
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.520]   my own house, that it's true.
[00:39:29.520 --> 00:39:33.160]   People, once you get used to swiping and tapping like that, you want to...
[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:34.160]   I can't do it on the screen.
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:35.160]   I would love to have it.
[00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:39.720]   I can't imagine a future in which all laptops, in which all personal computer screens are
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:41.080]   not touch screens, even from Apple.
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:42.080]   Why not?
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:43.080]   Exactly.
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:44.080]   Why not just do it?
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:45.080]   It's just not as well included.
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:47.920]   It's typical of Apple to say, "This is my song.
[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:51.280]   It's just not going to work until the day they release it."
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:52.920]   We figured out a way to make it work.
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:53.920]   Here it is.
[00:39:53.920 --> 00:39:54.920]   Oh, yeah.
[00:39:54.920 --> 00:39:55.920]   That's what they do.
[00:39:55.920 --> 00:39:57.240]   Exactly how it will happen.
[00:39:57.240 --> 00:39:58.240]   And the back pedaling...
[00:39:58.240 --> 00:39:59.240]   Oh, I know.
[00:39:59.240 --> 00:40:00.240]   It will be masterful.
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:01.240]   They're very...
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:04.080]   Oh, they don't even have the backpedal.
[00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:05.080]   They just shift gears.
[00:40:05.080 --> 00:40:06.080]   Right.
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:07.080]   It's like, "No, no, it's good now."
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:09.200]   I don't know if Tim Cooks is good at back pedaling and Steve Jobs.
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:11.920]   He was really a master of the...
[00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:13.840]   The reality distortion feel.
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:15.000]   You know, no, I never said that.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   You're wrong.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   People don't want to watch a video on an iPod.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   Oh, by the way.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.760]   Here's our iPod with video.
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:21.760]   Now they do.
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:23.880]   We're going to get scrugled in just a minute.
[00:40:23.880 --> 00:40:29.240]   We've got Ed Bot here from ZDNet, from IDG.
[00:40:29.240 --> 00:40:32.600]   Jason Snell, he's the editorial director, both PC, World and Macworld.
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:33.920]   So he knows where he's talking.
[00:40:33.920 --> 00:40:36.040]   He knows where he's speaking.
[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:38.600]   He's got one foot on each platform.
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:39.600]   Rafe Needleman.
[00:40:39.600 --> 00:40:40.600]   Now, at Evernote, how do you like that?
[00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:41.600]   You left CNET.
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:43.400]   You got out of the editorial world.
[00:40:43.400 --> 00:40:44.400]   Yeah.
[00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:45.400]   But everybody loves Evernote.
[00:40:45.400 --> 00:40:46.400]   I mean, it's just a wonderful...
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:47.400]   I mean, Wyben's been on the show.
[00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:48.400]   I just think he's great.
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:49.400]   It's a great place to work.
[00:40:49.400 --> 00:40:50.400]   I'm glad I went there.
[00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:51.400]   I mean, that's why I...
[00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:52.400]   People were playing the...
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:56.120]   When I was doing my podcast, the Rafe Needleman Evernote Drinking Game, and they were getting
[00:40:56.120 --> 00:40:57.120]   slapped.
[00:40:57.120 --> 00:40:58.120]   Every time I mentioned Evernote, you'd mention it a lot.
[00:40:58.120 --> 00:40:59.120]   Yeah.
[00:40:59.120 --> 00:41:00.120]   I just...
[00:41:00.120 --> 00:41:01.120]   So you decided to go pro.
[00:41:01.120 --> 00:41:04.240]   So essentially, you warmed your way into a job by giving a lot of free publicity in advance
[00:41:04.240 --> 00:41:05.240]   of your asset.
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:06.240]   Yes, I did.
[00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:07.240]   And for the job...
[00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:08.240]   That is the negative.
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:09.240]   Perfectly cynical way of looking at it.
[00:41:09.240 --> 00:41:10.240]   Very, completely wrong.
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:11.240]   But...
[00:41:11.240 --> 00:41:12.240]   You know what's interesting...
[00:41:12.240 --> 00:41:13.240]   You know what's interesting?
[00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:14.240]   Blackberry 10...
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:19.240]   And then I document the number of times you mentioned Evernote.
[00:41:19.240 --> 00:41:20.240]   You could say that and...
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:22.840]   There is no Evernote app on Blackberry yet, right?
[00:41:22.840 --> 00:41:23.840]   Or is there?
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:27.080]   There's an Evernote for Blackberry, and the Blackberry 10 has it integrated in.
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:29.560]   Yeah, it ships with an Evernote integrated...
[00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:31.560]   Shared Evernote kind of is everywhere.
[00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:32.560]   Yeah.
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:35.560]   We believe on being native on all platforms that matter.
[00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:36.560]   I think that's very interesting.
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:39.160]   In fact, it makes me actually want to try Blackberry 10.
[00:41:39.160 --> 00:41:42.200]   Are you on Linux?
[00:41:42.200 --> 00:41:43.200]   Only on the web.
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:44.200]   He said, "Plosomes that matter."
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:45.200]   Oh wait, he said the word "matter."
[00:41:45.200 --> 00:41:46.200]   Fortunately, there's no way.
[00:41:46.200 --> 00:41:49.240]   So now all you Linux people out there know what he thinks about your...
[00:41:49.240 --> 00:41:50.760]   There's my target, shoot at me.
[00:41:50.760 --> 00:41:53.440]   Yeah, there is an API and people have written Evernote...
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:54.440]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:58.240]   Test stops or applications for our API.
[00:41:58.240 --> 00:41:59.240]   You know, Phil Libon...
[00:41:59.240 --> 00:42:02.680]   And by the way, and I'm not taking a job with Evernote, but Phil Libon once told me that
[00:42:02.680 --> 00:42:06.720]   4% of all the referrals were by Leo Laporte that I was such an Evernote Flash.
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:07.720]   You should be on the board.
[00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:08.720]   Yeah, I don't want...
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:10.640]   No, I don't have anything to do with them.
[00:42:10.640 --> 00:42:13.440]   But I agree, it's very cool.
[00:42:13.440 --> 00:42:18.360]   And I go back with Pre-Phil Libon when it was that roll of toilet paper that went up the
[00:42:18.360 --> 00:42:19.360]   screen.
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:20.360]   Remember that?
[00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:21.360]   Two of you you never know it's for.
[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:22.360]   It was a response to one note.
[00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:23.680]   I just stick everything in there.
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:28.200]   And the nice thing about having integration into your devices is it's very easy.
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:29.920]   I have a little elephant on my menu bar.
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:32.160]   I have it in my phone.
[00:42:32.160 --> 00:42:33.800]   It's very easy just to put something I never know.
[00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:35.800]   And then you have it.
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:36.800]   There's lots of things you can do.
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:37.960]   I took a picture of a flower.
[00:42:37.960 --> 00:42:39.160]   I said, "This is pretty...
[00:42:39.160 --> 00:42:40.160]   What is it?"
[00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:42.680]   I said, "This is a flower I never know so that I could refer to it later."
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:43.680]   Just little things like that.
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:47.880]   When I am parking in the airport, I take a picture of my parking spot and never know
[00:42:47.880 --> 00:42:48.880]   so that I can get back to my parking spot.
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:51.080]   Oh, you don't use this thing to park, find my spot.
[00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:52.080]   You know, that's too complicated.
[00:42:52.080 --> 00:42:53.080]   You just push a button, boom.
[00:42:53.080 --> 00:42:54.080]   Yeah, but then it's got GPS.
[00:42:54.080 --> 00:42:57.120]   And you're like one of those idiots walking through the parking garage with your phone
[00:42:57.120 --> 00:42:58.120]   app.
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:42:59.120]   Beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.
[00:42:59.120 --> 00:43:01.120]   That's not a Geiger counter.
[00:43:01.120 --> 00:43:05.680]   It's every war channel is on the flight back as you, you know, as you were listening to music
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:09.520]   and your battery's dead and you're going, "You know, God, I hope my battery doesn't
[00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:11.560]   die before I find my car."
[00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:12.960]   That's why I don't use iPhones.
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:16.880]   I use Galaxy phones that I have three batteries for my note.
[00:43:16.880 --> 00:43:18.040]   I just carry them with me.
[00:43:18.040 --> 00:43:20.160]   The eyes I get another day out of another battery.
[00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:21.320]   That's the biggest phone.
[00:43:21.320 --> 00:43:22.320]   That's a note, right?
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:23.320]   It's a note too, yeah.
[00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:24.320]   You mungus.
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:25.320]   Big is good.
[00:43:25.320 --> 00:43:26.640]   Looks small when LeBron James holds it though.
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:27.640]   Yeah.
[00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:30.200]   That doesn't, you know, for a long time people said, "Hold it to your head."
[00:43:30.200 --> 00:43:31.200]   And then they laugh.
[00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:32.200]   This doesn't look that bad.
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:34.200]   You have a large head though.
[00:43:34.200 --> 00:43:36.160]   Yeah, you have a really big head.
[00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:40.400]   It's not like holding an iPad to your head.
[00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:41.400]   No, but that's next.
[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:42.400]   It is next.
[00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:43.400]   It's actually just read the seven-inch.
[00:43:43.400 --> 00:43:47.720]   Well, for minis especially with Skype, it's a good phone.
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:48.720]   That's my goal.
[00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:51.520]   I'm lobbying to get Apple to make a phone.
[00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:56.440]   The next iPhone should be a mini and there are rumors that there will be a bigger iPhone
[00:43:56.440 --> 00:43:57.440]   that maybe is in between--
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:01.200]   Apple's actually working on a stretchable phone pad, whatever it says.
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:02.200]   A little rubber phone.
[00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:04.280]   We're going to get screwgled in just a little bit.
[00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:09.480]   But first, for those of you who are doing mailing a tip to be a professional at mailing
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:14.040]   stamps.com lets you print your own-- did you know postage is going up again?
[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:15.040]   It's a scam.
[00:44:15.040 --> 00:44:16.760]   And now they don't want to do Saturday delivery?
[00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:17.760]   It's a scam.
[00:44:17.760 --> 00:44:18.760]   I told you this before.
[00:44:18.760 --> 00:44:19.560]   They made them pre-
[00:44:19.560 --> 00:44:27.160]   They're not allowed to make them for decades of their retirement fund.
[00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:28.640]   They have to pre-fund it.
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:30.200]   Like for decades.
[00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:31.400]   And so it's breaking them.
[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:32.400]   And then it's all--
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.080]   But it's not a federal agency.
[00:44:34.080 --> 00:44:35.080]   It's privatized.
[00:44:35.080 --> 00:44:37.880]   It's in the Constitution that we have to do.
[00:44:37.880 --> 00:44:38.880]   We have to do it.
[00:44:38.880 --> 00:44:42.240]   Because they're trying to turn this over to FedEx and you guys are thinking it's so funny
[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:45.960]   to get rid of the mail and then instead of paying $0.50 you're going to be being $8.00
[00:44:45.960 --> 00:44:47.240]   to get a letter out.
[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:48.240]   That's why you want to get stamps.com.
[00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:50.680]   You're going to keep the Postal Service alive.
[00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:54.520]   And by the way, there's still a lot of people who use the Postal Service, eBay and Etsy and
[00:44:54.520 --> 00:44:58.120]   Amazon PayPal sellers, people who mail out invoices and stuff.
[00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:00.000]   That's where the Postal Service is a great deal.
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:04.720]   And when you have a stamps.com scale like this and it automates your mailing.
[00:45:04.720 --> 00:45:06.080]   For anybody, there's a lot of mailing.
[00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:07.320]   You get to scale free?
[00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:08.320]   You do actually.
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:09.320]   It's a USB scale.
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:10.560]   It automates your mailing.
[00:45:10.560 --> 00:45:12.200]   So the idea is it'll take your--
[00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:14.200]   It uses MEMS.
[00:45:14.200 --> 00:45:15.560]   It probably does use MEMS.
[00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:17.040]   Yeah, it does.
[00:45:17.040 --> 00:45:19.000]   That's interesting because there's no moving parts.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:20.800]   So the micro-- what is it?
[00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:22.880]   Microelectronic mechanical system.
[00:45:22.880 --> 00:45:24.920]   Electro mechanical systems.
[00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:28.120]   So they don't-- it's like molecular level machines basically.
[00:45:28.120 --> 00:45:30.440]   Because yeah, this doesn't move.
[00:45:30.440 --> 00:45:32.040]   It's not like there's like some--
[00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:35.440]   It's in the old days of scales you'd have to press something down the spring deal.
[00:45:35.440 --> 00:45:36.960]   It's in the feet, the feet move.
[00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:37.960]   Oh, you're kidding.
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:38.960]   The little rubber feet move.
[00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:39.960]   Oh, they don't.
[00:45:39.960 --> 00:45:40.960]   You're such a liar.
[00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:41.960]   What?
[00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:42.960]   The old one did.
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:43.960]   That's the old one where you're--
[00:45:43.960 --> 00:45:44.960]   No, this is the new one.
[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:45.960]   I'm telling you, it's MEMS.
[00:45:45.960 --> 00:45:46.960]   It's totally MEMS.
[00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:48.600]   Anyway, enough of that.
[00:45:48.600 --> 00:45:51.760]   Let's talk about stamps.com.
[00:45:51.760 --> 00:45:52.760]   Print your own postage.
[00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:53.760]   You could print-- what?
[00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:55.760]   I'm just saying it's plausible that--
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:56.760]   It is plausible it's MEMS.
[00:45:56.760 --> 00:45:59.320]   You can also use this truck pad.
[00:45:59.320 --> 00:46:01.080]   It's cool again.
[00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:02.080]   What else?
[00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:03.880]   You get discounts you can't get to the post office.
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:07.160]   Mailcare comes and gets the stuff so you don't have to get up from your desk.
[00:46:07.160 --> 00:46:11.720]   You could take the address from your address book, your QuickBooks, or eBay, Amazon, PayPal,
[00:46:11.720 --> 00:46:13.760]   websites, all of that stuff.
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:14.760]   Now, wait a minute.
[00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:17.040]   Now, you see that $80 value on the front page there that special offer?
[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:18.040]   Don't do that.
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:20.840]   Click the microphone and enter in the offer code TWIT.
[00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:24.880]   That $80 special offer turns into a $110 T-W-I-T.
[00:46:24.880 --> 00:46:26.080]   That's the offer code.
[00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:27.880]   That's the $110 bonus offer.
[00:46:27.880 --> 00:46:31.520]   $55 a free postage, the digital scale, $5--
[00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:32.520]   Oh, picture of you.
[00:46:32.520 --> 00:46:34.160]   --and a picture of me.
[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:35.160]   Four-week trial.
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:39.920]   I'm a stamps.com user since the turn of the century.
[00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:41.320]   That's how long I've been using stamps.com.
[00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:42.320]   You know why?
[00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:45.400]   Because they used to have these-- and I think they still do.
[00:46:45.400 --> 00:46:48.880]   They used to have these-- I had my picture on a stamp.
[00:46:48.880 --> 00:46:50.720]   Do you remember that?
[00:46:50.720 --> 00:46:52.200]   You get photo stamps?
[00:46:52.200 --> 00:46:54.480]   Doesn't Zappo still make those things?
[00:46:54.480 --> 00:46:55.480]   Somebody may.
[00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:56.480]   Stamp still does it.
[00:46:56.480 --> 00:46:57.480]   Yeah, it is.
[00:46:57.480 --> 00:46:58.480]   It's on the website.
[00:46:58.480 --> 00:46:59.480]   Photo stamps.
[00:46:59.480 --> 00:47:00.480]   Photo stamps.com.
[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:01.480]   Photo stamps.com.
[00:47:01.480 --> 00:47:02.480]   Isn't that cool?
[00:47:02.480 --> 00:47:03.480]   Yeah, if you're a complete ego maniac.
[00:47:03.480 --> 00:47:06.480]   Actually, I put some cool pictures on there.
[00:47:06.480 --> 00:47:10.200]   I think it's illegal to put a commercial message on a stamp.
[00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:11.200]   Right.
[00:47:11.200 --> 00:47:12.760]   Which has not stopped people from actually doing it.
[00:47:12.760 --> 00:47:13.760]   Trying it.
[00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:14.760]   But, yeah, you wouldn't want to do that.
[00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:15.760]   You should be on the board.
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:17.800]   We're going to put you on every board now.
[00:47:17.800 --> 00:47:19.000]   I want to be on the board.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   You should be on the board.
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   No, I don't want to be on the board.
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   Stamps.com.
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   I want you to take advantage of the trial offer.
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:24.480]   That's all I ask.
[00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:25.920]   And we thank them for their support.
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:32.160]   Tom Merritt has been following the stories of the coming week and has this update for
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:33.160]   us, Mr. Merritt.
[00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:34.160]   Hey, thanks, Leo.
[00:47:34.160 --> 00:47:37.000]   Here's a look at some of the things we'll be keeping an eye on in the week ahead on
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   Tech News today.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   D Dive into Media starts at the Ritz Carlton in Southern California Laguna Miguel.
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:46.920]   That's going to be going on for a couple of days, February 11th and the 12th.
[00:47:46.920 --> 00:47:51.920]   On February 12th, the 11th Usenick Conference on File and Storage Technologies takes place.
[00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:53.400]   It's also Lincoln's birthday.
[00:47:53.400 --> 00:47:57.560]   Wednesday, February 13th, Windows Live Mesh closes.
[00:47:57.560 --> 00:48:01.880]   So hopefully you got your data out of that February 14th is Valentine's Day.
[00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:04.000]   So don't buy any chocolates or flowers on that day.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:08.320]   You'll pay way too much Friday, February 15th is the birthday of YouTube.
[00:48:08.320 --> 00:48:15.800]   It debuted in 2005 and Saturday, February 16th, Sim City hosting another closed beta and Nintendo
[00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:18.640]   intends to merge its handheld and console division.
[00:48:18.640 --> 00:48:20.040]   That's a look at the week ahead.
[00:48:20.040 --> 00:48:21.040]   Back to you, Leo.
[00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:22.040]   Live Mesh.
[00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:23.040]   We hardly knew you.
[00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:24.040]   I was using that before.
[00:48:24.040 --> 00:48:25.040]   It wasn't Microsoft.
[00:48:25.040 --> 00:48:26.320]   We're using it as a sync product.
[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:27.320]   Older share.
[00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:28.320]   Older share.
[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:34.480]   By byte taxi when the Microsoft bought and slowly squeezed to death until now it's just
[00:48:34.480 --> 00:48:36.080]   a floppy course.
[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:39.000]   So some people use it tight.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:40.560]   I'm sorry, just sneezed.
[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:43.280]   Some people I got I brought back a cold from New Orleans, but it's the end.
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:44.280]   It's a tail end.
[00:48:44.280 --> 00:48:45.280]   So it's okay.
[00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:46.480]   I brought that and Beyonce back with me.
[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:49.120]   So no, no, the finger laser is not Beyonce herself.
[00:48:49.120 --> 00:48:52.400]   So the idea was it was it was a sync.
[00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:53.800]   It's a sync was a sync tool.
[00:48:53.800 --> 00:48:58.920]   Well, the original father share was a sync tool that didn't sync to the cloud because
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:48:59.920]   I'm so old.
[00:48:59.920 --> 00:49:01.440]   I remember before there was a cloud.
[00:49:01.440 --> 00:49:06.600]   So it was actually if you had two computers on at the same time, it would sync.
[00:49:06.600 --> 00:49:08.400]   If one of them was not on, no sync.
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:09.600]   Ah, it was peer to peer.
[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:10.600]   Yes.
[00:49:10.600 --> 00:49:13.080]   But now, but they've now integrated the cloud.
[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:15.760]   In fact, that's the whole point is that you want to use SkyDrive instead.
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:16.760]   Right.
[00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:19.960]   If you have mesh data, you lose it right when they turn the server off.
[00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:24.720]   Well, yeah, but they've been warning about this for about a year and a half.
[00:49:24.720 --> 00:49:35.920]   Anybody who and and the Windows live mesh user base was small and geeky and they are
[00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:39.720]   the kind who know who have already gone to their office.
[00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:40.720]   They've already been.
[00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:41.720]   They've already.
[00:49:41.720 --> 00:49:42.720]   Pointed.
[00:49:42.720 --> 00:49:46.200]   There's like five there's like five people left and but they've done the right thing
[00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:47.200]   here.
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:48.200]   They've done that.
[00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:54.080]   But interesting, Rafe's history is is accurate, but it misses one little thing there.
[00:49:54.080 --> 00:49:58.760]   At the time, I remember this because we wrote about it in one of our books at the time,
[00:49:58.760 --> 00:50:06.040]   Microsoft had either four or five competing synchronization solutions that they were
[00:50:06.040 --> 00:50:07.240]   offering.
[00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:14.960]   And and it was it was classic Microsoft of the early to mid 2000s.
[00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:21.240]   Throw a bunch of crap out there and see which ones survive.
[00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:30.120]   And what they've done with SkyDrive to their credit is to throw away all of the weird competing
[00:50:30.120 --> 00:50:37.360]   alternatives and focus on one service, put some resources behind it and build it build
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:43.440]   a good solid base on it and then start expanding the features incrementally so that every quarter,
[00:50:43.440 --> 00:50:45.320]   there's a new release for it every year.
[00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:49.120]   There's a major new wave of it where you get new features.
[00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:54.080]   So if you compare SkyDrive today to what it was six months ago, a year ago, 18 months
[00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:57.680]   ago, the progression has been profound.
[00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:00.240]   Well, Microsoft really is desperate.
[00:51:00.240 --> 00:51:03.080]   They desperately have to do this because of they've had competing systems and they've
[00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:08.720]   had a various pricing options that were impossible to keep track of.
[00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:13.680]   And I mean, I wanted to use some of this stuff and I went into it and I couldn't figure,
[00:51:13.680 --> 00:51:17.880]   I mean, I was like here, Microsoft, please help me sink my stuff.
[00:51:17.880 --> 00:51:20.080]   And about a year ago, it was incomprehensible.
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:23.320]   So finally, narrowing down the product sets, that's the right thing to do.
[00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:25.080]   Hopefully they can keep this thing going.
[00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:28.360]   It's important product, important to have cloud sync.
[00:51:28.360 --> 00:51:30.800]   Microsoft's back with their, this is the Microsoft show.
[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:31.800]   We'll do some Mac stuff too.
[00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:38.400]   And by the way, they announced this week 1 billion documents stored on SkyDrive.
[00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:43.880]   And also a new feature that they announced this week, which is very welcome, is you can
[00:51:43.880 --> 00:51:49.600]   put a document up there now, make it public and anyone can, if you want them to, can edit
[00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:53.680]   that document without having to sign in with a Microsoft account.
[00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:57.200]   So, you know, that's a good thing.
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:58.200]   Yeah.
[00:51:58.200 --> 00:52:02.040]   Although they really do want you to get a Microsoft account.
[00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:03.040]   Yeah.
[00:52:03.040 --> 00:52:04.040]   Why not?
[00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:05.040]   Why not?
[00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:06.040]   Why not?
[00:52:06.040 --> 00:52:07.040]   Why not?
[00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:13.440]   I'll tell you why you don't get a Gmail account because you'll get scruggled.
[00:52:13.440 --> 00:52:16.320]   They're back with the scruggled campaign this time.
[00:52:16.320 --> 00:52:18.720]   First scruggled campaign was about Google shopping.
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:21.920]   Is this an age outside agency doing these scruggled campaigns?
[00:52:21.920 --> 00:52:22.920]   What is it?
[00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:23.920]   What is the deal with this?
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:25.480]   This time it's Gmail.
[00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:29.360]   Think Google respects your privacy.
[00:52:29.360 --> 00:52:30.360]   Think again.
[00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:32.320]   This is, it's fun.
[00:52:32.320 --> 00:52:33.320]   It gets dumb.
[00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:39.640]   The thing about this stuff is the consumers, they'll get up in arms and they will, at least
[00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:46.360]   in my experience, convince consumers to act, not care, not say they care, but actually act
[00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:49.360]   on threats about privacy and security and hacking.
[00:52:49.360 --> 00:52:51.360]   But there's a petition right here.
[00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:54.480]   You can sign a petition that says, you can sign a petition.
[00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:56.880]   People will sign a petition and then not change their email.
[00:52:56.880 --> 00:52:57.880]   That's what they'll do.
[00:52:57.880 --> 00:52:58.880]   That's true.
[00:52:58.880 --> 00:52:59.880]   That's true.
[00:52:59.880 --> 00:53:00.880]   That's absolutely true.
[00:53:00.880 --> 00:53:03.720]   I'll point out, by the way, there's only the scruggled things we've been going on for
[00:53:03.720 --> 00:53:04.720]   a week.
[00:53:04.720 --> 00:53:05.720]   There's 4,000 signatures.
[00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:06.720]   That's terrible.
[00:53:06.720 --> 00:53:07.720]   That's not really exactly.
[00:53:07.720 --> 00:53:09.520]   It doesn't get traction.
[00:53:09.520 --> 00:53:13.680]   But so beside that, the petition is, tell Google to stop going through your email and
[00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:14.680]   sell ads.
[00:53:14.680 --> 00:53:17.800]   Obviously, Microsoft doesn't really want Google to stop doing that because that's a competitive
[00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:19.520]   advantage for Microsoft.
[00:53:19.520 --> 00:53:21.800]   But I should point out that Microsoft goes through your email.
[00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:22.800]   They just don't do ads.
[00:53:22.800 --> 00:53:25.080]   They do it for spam and other reasons.
[00:53:25.080 --> 00:53:30.080]   Everybody goes, if you have any spam on an email system, it's got to go through your email.
[00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:31.440]   It's not a human reading the email.
[00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:36.560]   It's a computer algorithm looking for keywords, whether they target ads or not.
[00:53:36.560 --> 00:53:42.120]   There are reasons that you might not want to get ads based on the content of your email.
[00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:44.320]   There are plenty of good reasons.
[00:53:44.320 --> 00:53:49.160]   But it's not like a human being is reading your email.
[00:53:49.160 --> 00:53:51.160]   It's free.
[00:53:51.160 --> 00:53:55.920]   Why is spam going through your email for spam to fight spam any different than going through
[00:53:55.920 --> 00:53:58.320]   your email to target ads?
[00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:00.320]   Well, one is just a...
[00:54:00.320 --> 00:54:07.160]   Well, look, every email system has to go through and it has to process the server that it came
[00:54:07.160 --> 00:54:12.480]   from and the address that it came from to display that to you.
[00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:16.680]   There's certain things that any web-based service has to do.
[00:54:16.680 --> 00:54:19.280]   But then it does it.
[00:54:19.280 --> 00:54:21.560]   It makes a decision.
[00:54:21.560 --> 00:54:23.520]   It takes an action.
[00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:27.960]   And then it moves on without storing that.
[00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:28.960]   That's the difference.
[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:30.480]   Look, this campaign...
[00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:32.040]   That's not what this campaign says.
[00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:35.880]   It says, "Google goes through every Gmail at center received looking for keywords so they
[00:54:35.880 --> 00:54:37.640]   can target you with paid ads."
[00:54:37.640 --> 00:54:39.160]   And that is true.
[00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:40.920]   It's a legitimate issue.
[00:54:40.920 --> 00:54:42.400]   It's a corny...
[00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:44.440]   It's a cornball campaign.
[00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:47.160]   But the underlying issue is real.
[00:54:47.160 --> 00:54:52.920]   Look, Google's revenue stream is advertising.
[00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:58.440]   They get between 94 and 97 percent of their revenues from advertising and they get it
[00:54:58.440 --> 00:55:00.640]   from Gmail.
[00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:04.960]   One of the services that they get it from, they want you to use their services because
[00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:09.960]   they want to collect the data and use it to build a profile of you that they can use
[00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:12.120]   to make more effective advertising.
[00:55:12.120 --> 00:55:13.120]   That's a fact.
[00:55:13.120 --> 00:55:14.120]   That's a real issue.
[00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:15.120]   So what's wrong with that?
[00:55:15.120 --> 00:55:16.120]   It's a real issue.
[00:55:16.120 --> 00:55:24.080]   Google, take away the cornball campaign and you have a potential real privacy issue.
[00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:25.480]   Good thing Google isn't evil.
[00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:27.000]   I mean, all right.
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:28.720]   But let me tell you something else.
[00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:33.960]   Just to take the other side of the argument here, Google does go through and index your
[00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:39.240]   email and makes it searchable, which means when you are searching the web now with Google,
[00:55:39.240 --> 00:55:41.240]   it will now optionally also search your email.
[00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:42.640]   I turned that on because I like that.
[00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:43.640]   Oh, it's fantastic.
[00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:46.640]   So not only do you find what you're looking for on the web, but you find what you're looking
[00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:49.160]   for that somebody sent you to read my email to do that.
[00:55:49.160 --> 00:55:50.160]   That's right.
[00:55:50.160 --> 00:55:51.160]   Exactly.
[00:55:51.160 --> 00:55:52.160]   But that point is this is...
[00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:53.160]   All right.
[00:55:53.160 --> 00:55:56.040]   It's a great feature.
[00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:57.280]   Nobody's reading your email.
[00:55:57.280 --> 00:56:00.840]   It's all a machine anyway at the moment.
[00:56:00.840 --> 00:56:07.120]   Google actually has a clone farm where they're reading email readers.
[00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:08.120]   Here's the problem Leo.
[00:56:08.120 --> 00:56:12.560]   I spend a lot of time working with privacy issues.
[00:56:12.560 --> 00:56:15.120]   This isn't a Microsoft versus Google thing.
[00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:20.480]   This is a big corporations versus people issue.
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:24.320]   The trouble with all of this is that information about you is being collected.
[00:56:24.320 --> 00:56:30.640]   It's being hoovered in by everything you do on the web.
[00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:37.080]   And if it were only being stored in cookies and used to display targeted ads, then maybe
[00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:38.440]   you could say it doesn't matter.
[00:56:38.440 --> 00:56:45.600]   But the fact is these data points about you, these profiles of you are being created and
[00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:48.600]   then they're being correlated with offline profiles.
[00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:53.120]   And they are being used to influence things in your life.
[00:56:53.120 --> 00:56:54.480]   And we're at a point right now.
[00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:59.160]   This is like climate change was 30 years ago.
[00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:00.720]   What things in my life are they doing?
[00:57:00.720 --> 00:57:01.720]   Climate change have to do well.
[00:57:01.720 --> 00:57:02.720]   What things...
[00:57:02.720 --> 00:57:05.920]   No, I understand what he's saying, which is this is the tip of the iceberg.
[00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:06.920]   There's a big unknown...
[00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:08.920]   By the time you...
[00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:09.920]   By the time...
[00:57:09.920 --> 00:57:15.160]   Ten years from now, by the time you realize how much information has been collected about
[00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:16.520]   you, it's going to be too late.
[00:57:16.520 --> 00:57:17.520]   But what things are they influencing?
[00:57:17.520 --> 00:57:19.200]   I mean, really, what is the impact of this?
[00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:20.360]   I keep asking this question.
[00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:22.520]   John keeps coming up with the insurance thing.
[00:57:22.520 --> 00:57:24.520]   Oh, that's one of the things that's absolutely...
[00:57:24.520 --> 00:57:25.520]   Absolutely.
[00:57:25.520 --> 00:57:27.560]   Yeah, we saw Leo break the desk.
[00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:29.640]   He got to give the raises insurance.
[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:31.720]   I saw this ad to a state farmer.
[00:57:31.720 --> 00:57:32.720]   Risky...
[00:57:32.720 --> 00:57:35.920]   Said you could put this thing in your car into the OBD port and it would track your...
[00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:36.920]   Guess what?
[00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:39.000]   That's going to become mandatory for insurance.
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:40.000]   That's terrifying.
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:41.000]   This is going on right now.
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:46.280]   The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration has proposed rules that would mandate event
[00:57:46.280 --> 00:57:48.920]   data recorders in all new cars and like trucks.
[00:57:48.920 --> 00:57:51.880]   Guess when the period for comment ends...
[00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:52.880]   Yesterday.
[00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:53.880]   Tomorrow.
[00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:54.880]   So yeah...
[00:57:54.880 --> 00:57:55.880]   The event data recorders are one thing.
[00:57:55.880 --> 00:57:56.880]   It's the non-event recorders.
[00:57:56.880 --> 00:57:58.880]   It's just the log of how fast you drive, how...
[00:57:58.880 --> 00:57:59.880]   That's what this record...
[00:57:59.880 --> 00:58:00.880]   No, event data's are...
[00:58:00.880 --> 00:58:03.120]   If there's a wreck, it records...
[00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:04.120]   It's like a crash.
[00:58:04.120 --> 00:58:05.120]   It's a blackboard.
[00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:06.120]   It's a blackboard.
[00:58:06.120 --> 00:58:07.120]   Here's what they collect.
[00:58:07.120 --> 00:58:09.280]   Vehicle speed engine throttle position break use.
[00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:10.520]   Driver safety belt status.
[00:58:10.520 --> 00:58:11.800]   Air bag warning lamp status.
[00:58:11.800 --> 00:58:13.320]   Changes in velocity.
[00:58:13.320 --> 00:58:14.320]   Continuous.
[00:58:14.320 --> 00:58:17.320]   The rule says there's a minimum amount of data.
[00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:18.800]   There's no maximum amount of data.
[00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:21.160]   They can collect data for the entire lifetime of the car.
[00:58:21.160 --> 00:58:22.160]   You know what I want?
[00:58:22.160 --> 00:58:24.360]   I want that piped into my Google.
[00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:27.480]   So I get ads based on what a jerk of a driver I am.
[00:58:27.480 --> 00:58:30.640]   Well thank goodness Microsoft is looking out for all of us on this.
[00:58:30.640 --> 00:58:34.320]   It isn't at all just a cynically motivated way to promote their own email service.
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:35.920]   This really is like climate change.
[00:58:35.920 --> 00:58:37.480]   You're looking out for the common good.
[00:58:37.480 --> 00:58:40.880]   I'll give you the prediction of course where this is really going to head.
[00:58:40.880 --> 00:58:43.520]   Is that you have to get your car smogged all the time.
[00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:45.840]   And these guys are always looking for new income streams.
[00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:47.720]   So they'll get a piece of the action at the smog.
[00:58:47.720 --> 00:58:48.720]   They download this stuff.
[00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:50.720]   By busting you for speeding.
[00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:52.320]   Because they know exactly where you were.
[00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:54.840]   You were doing 78 miles an hour on the freeway.
[00:58:54.840 --> 00:58:56.640]   It's a 65 mile an hour zone.
[00:58:56.640 --> 00:59:00.000]   You now have to pay X amount of money.
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:01.640]   And they have you dead to rights.
[00:59:01.640 --> 00:59:05.080]   Well you're testifying against yourself and they're going to use this to crank up their
[00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:06.080]   revenues.
[00:59:06.080 --> 00:59:07.080]   We show the show.
[00:59:07.080 --> 00:59:08.080]   You'll get real time.
[00:59:08.080 --> 00:59:10.400]   This will sell off self driving guys.
[00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:11.640]   Cars you'll get real time tickets.
[00:59:11.640 --> 00:59:13.080]   I won't have to hoover up the data.
[00:59:13.080 --> 00:59:14.760]   The data will be transmitted into the cloud.
[00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:15.760]   Forget it.
[00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:16.760]   Red light camera.
[00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:17.760]   You got my black box.
[00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:19.240]   There are ten foil mats by the way.
[00:59:19.240 --> 00:59:22.280]   I'll bet you miss this happens here.
[00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:25.000]   But it doesn't happen in Europe.
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:28.760]   Because they are very privacy much stricter privacy regulation.
[00:59:28.760 --> 00:59:32.480]   So Ed you agree this is another problem and means they'll come true.
[00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:34.960]   This is a serious problem.
[00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:37.360]   Take the corny Microsoft campaign out of it.
[00:59:37.360 --> 00:59:38.360]   I agree.
[00:59:38.360 --> 00:59:40.560]   It's corny campaign.
[00:59:40.560 --> 00:59:44.280]   There's good and bad reasons to choose an email service.
[00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:46.520]   But this is a serious issue.
[00:59:46.520 --> 00:59:47.520]   Okay.
[00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:48.800]   From a larger point of view.
[00:59:48.800 --> 00:59:49.800]   I think it's much more likely.
[00:59:49.800 --> 00:59:51.120]   It's a much larger privacy point of view.
[00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:55.040]   And Microsoft because their business model is to sell hardware and software doesn't really
[00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:56.040]   care.
[00:59:56.040 --> 00:59:58.120]   So we should trust them.
[00:59:58.120 --> 00:59:59.120]   It isn't a matter of trust.
[00:59:59.120 --> 01:00:00.720]   It isn't a matter of trusting them.
[01:00:00.720 --> 01:00:05.720]   It's a matter of saying there's one company.
[01:00:05.720 --> 01:00:07.040]   Why should you use no web?
[01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:11.080]   I should use no web email if I don't trust the company.
[01:00:11.080 --> 01:00:12.080]   Right.
[01:00:12.080 --> 01:00:14.440]   And ideally you should use products that aren't free.
[01:00:14.440 --> 01:00:17.440]   Because if they're free they're making money off the product.
[01:00:17.440 --> 01:00:19.280]   That's why you're the product.
[01:00:19.280 --> 01:00:20.280]   No.
[01:00:20.280 --> 01:00:23.440]   That's why I pay for email.
[01:00:23.440 --> 01:00:27.000]   And like Rafe said, Rafe said something really good back there.
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:31.840]   He said I want access to this information for myself.
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:33.080]   That's the way it should work.
[01:00:33.080 --> 01:00:35.080]   Doesn't Google do that with their dashboard?
[01:00:35.080 --> 01:00:39.160]   Does information should be collected and it should be compartmentalized and available
[01:00:39.160 --> 01:00:40.160]   only to you.
[01:00:40.160 --> 01:00:47.080]   But the reality is that it's going to be aggregated and profiled and made available.
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:53.520]   And we're not going to know for another 10 years how horrible the impact of all of this
[01:00:53.520 --> 01:00:54.720]   stuff is going to be.
[01:00:54.720 --> 01:00:57.440]   Get Gmail, forget Hotmail.
[01:00:57.440 --> 01:01:02.680]   Let's talk about every time you visit a website and all of this information that's being collected.
[01:01:02.680 --> 01:01:08.940]   I just want somebody to tell me something real that's going to happen to me in 10 years
[01:01:08.940 --> 01:01:10.760]   because I didn't care.
[01:01:10.760 --> 01:01:12.720]   This insurance thing is bogus.
[01:01:12.720 --> 01:01:14.720]   No, no, that's the real thing.
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:18.540]   You ever notice how progressive is the most interesting company because they're the ones
[01:01:18.540 --> 01:01:22.320]   who before they became an insurance company and I noticed because I went there to give
[01:01:22.320 --> 01:01:24.760]   a speech once and they gave me the long lecture.
[01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:29.000]   There were a major actuarial company that used the computer systems that were available
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:34.040]   to them to really pretty much predict what was going to happen to you based on where you
[01:01:34.040 --> 01:01:36.800]   lived and how old you were in all the other background stuff.
[01:01:36.800 --> 01:01:40.880]   And that's why when they became an insurance company they could do the bit where we'll
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:45.280]   give you all the estimates of all the companies and you can pick us or not because they knew
[01:01:45.280 --> 01:01:46.280]   them all.
[01:01:46.280 --> 01:01:49.360]   Because they knew what you were really worth which was their number and there were people
[01:01:49.360 --> 01:01:53.080]   that they will send you to some other low baller because they don't want you.
[01:01:53.080 --> 01:01:56.720]   They don't want you because the low baller will take a beating on you.
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:00.160]   This used to be called redlining.
[01:02:00.160 --> 01:02:04.360]   When the banks would not lend to black neighborhoods because...
[01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:06.920]   The black neighborhoods to minority neighborhoods.
[01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:10.760]   So you could have an absolutely stellar credit record.
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:17.320]   You could have a perfect property but you would be redlined and as a result you would
[01:02:17.320 --> 01:02:20.840]   have to pay an interest rate that would be two, three, four points higher than somebody
[01:02:20.840 --> 01:02:23.480]   else or you couldn't get a loan at all.
[01:02:23.480 --> 01:02:27.600]   Redlining is going to be... is going to go from what used to be a little tiny thing in
[01:02:27.600 --> 01:02:30.640]   the mortgage industry to affecting just about everything.
[01:02:30.640 --> 01:02:38.440]   We're already seeing it in online markets for things like travel and merchandise.
[01:02:38.440 --> 01:02:44.160]   You're already seeing prices that are being offered to people based on their online profile.
[01:02:44.160 --> 01:02:53.440]   So if they see that you're a risk or see that you're rich, Leo they look at you and they
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:54.440]   see, "Hey, this guy...
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:56.440]   What do people think I'm rich?
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:57.440]   What is this?
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:58.440]   Look at me.
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:02:59.440]   I'm wearing an eye-opening.
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:00.440]   Your fashion wool coat.
[01:03:00.440 --> 01:03:04.000]   You know, we're going to put an extra zero on the end of your price tag.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:08.480]   The point is all of the mechanisms for doing this kind of...
[01:03:08.480 --> 01:03:10.880]   I would explain my superposition.
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:12.880]   All the mechanisms...
[01:03:12.880 --> 01:03:16.880]   All of the big data collection is out there.
[01:03:16.880 --> 01:03:22.000]   You know, the trouble is all of this data is being collected now by organizations that
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:25.120]   have no idea what they're going to do with it.
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:30.400]   If you talk to privacy experts about this, people who are not in the advertising industry
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:37.880]   but who are in the privacy industry, they'll tell you that companies that are...
[01:03:37.880 --> 01:03:42.280]   These are collecting data like there's no tomorrow and they're just storing it because
[01:03:42.280 --> 01:03:44.080]   they know that it's valuable.
[01:03:44.080 --> 01:03:45.080]   What do we do?
[01:03:45.080 --> 01:03:46.080]   What do we do?
[01:03:46.080 --> 01:03:47.080]   How do we fight this?
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:54.600]   Well, one thing that you do is you install products on your computer that prevent information
[01:03:54.600 --> 01:03:57.680]   from leaking out.
[01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:02.320]   Things like there's abines, do not track plus.
[01:04:02.320 --> 01:04:03.800]   There's privacy fix.
[01:04:03.800 --> 01:04:05.600]   You running all this stuff in?
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:06.600]   There's ghostery.
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:07.600]   I use...
[01:04:07.600 --> 01:04:10.880]   It's like too much work.
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:11.880]   It's a lot of work.
[01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:13.880]   It's a lot of work.
[01:04:13.880 --> 01:04:14.880]   Does anybody else do this?
[01:04:14.880 --> 01:04:15.880]   Do you do it any of this?
[01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:17.600]   I use ghostery but it has so many...
[01:04:17.600 --> 01:04:18.600]   It tells you all this stuff.
[01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:23.000]   It drops a thing the size of a blimp on your...
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:26.480]   I think we should all move to the hills.
[01:04:26.480 --> 01:04:27.480]   Stop using...
[01:04:27.480 --> 01:04:30.080]   We only use gold and stop being online.
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:32.080]   I'll go out and nuke the sights more.
[01:04:32.080 --> 01:04:36.480]   We all laughed at Al Gore 10 years ago about...
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:37.480]   Global warming.
[01:04:37.480 --> 01:04:39.760]   I still laugh at him.
[01:04:39.760 --> 01:04:40.760]   Guess what?
[01:04:40.760 --> 01:04:41.760]   Yeah.
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:42.760]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:45.120]   There's a guy worried about global warming.
[01:04:45.120 --> 01:04:47.920]   He's living in Santa Fe, New Mexico.
[01:04:47.920 --> 01:04:49.200]   Move north, my friend.
[01:04:49.200 --> 01:04:50.200]   Washington state.
[01:04:50.200 --> 01:04:51.200]   But change.
[01:04:51.200 --> 01:04:52.200]   All right.
[01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:53.200]   I'll grant you.
[01:04:53.200 --> 01:04:54.200]   I'll grant you.
[01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:56.520]   There's a potential for this.
[01:04:56.520 --> 01:04:59.640]   I'm not just wondering, is there anything we could do about it or is it too already too
[01:04:59.640 --> 01:05:00.640]   late?
[01:05:00.640 --> 01:05:02.400]   Do governmental intervention?
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:04.160]   The government doesn't want this.
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:06.160]   No, that's why they want the EDR.
[01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:08.840]   They want us to protect our privacy.
[01:05:08.840 --> 01:05:11.280]   The more they know, the better.
[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:12.280]   Yeah.
[01:05:12.280 --> 01:05:14.520]   So they're not going to legislate against this.
[01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:15.680]   Should I move to Europe?
[01:05:15.680 --> 01:05:16.680]   Yes.
[01:05:16.680 --> 01:05:18.680]   Well, I think what's going to happen is we're going to have a world where there are people
[01:05:18.680 --> 01:05:21.760]   who are concerned about privacy and are going to spend money and the people who don't have
[01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:23.560]   the money to spend aren't going to have privacy.
[01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:25.160]   I think that's where we're headed.
[01:05:25.160 --> 01:05:28.080]   The people who don't have money to spend aren't going to get a lawyer.
[01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:29.080]   Have.
[01:05:29.080 --> 01:05:34.120]   Is a world where privacy laws are dictated by Europe?
[01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:35.320]   Thank God.
[01:05:35.320 --> 01:05:39.240]   And so they're going to set the standard and we're going to follow along because the lawmakers
[01:05:39.240 --> 01:05:45.560]   in this country are paying zero respect to privacy issues.
[01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:51.200]   And so thankfully, Europe is leading the way on a lot of this stuff.
[01:05:51.200 --> 01:05:58.520]   And because the internet is global, and because it's too expensive to put together systems
[01:05:58.520 --> 01:06:03.240]   that have one set of rules for Americans and another set of rules for Germans and another
[01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:08.480]   set of people in India, the most restrictive set of rules is going to be the one that tends
[01:06:08.480 --> 01:06:15.080]   to dictate the behavior of large corporations like Microsoft and Yahoo and Google.
[01:06:15.080 --> 01:06:19.000]   And notice I said it in that order so that no one would accuse me of discriminating.
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:26.200]   But the reality is that we should be thankful for the fact that the European Union right
[01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:34.080]   now is paying attention to privacy issues and actually having an impact on these things.
[01:06:34.080 --> 01:06:38.720]   I'll give us an example of the impact.
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:47.120]   The data collection rules that are in place for Europe are dictating a lot of the ways
[01:06:47.120 --> 01:06:55.280]   that data is being collected and stored in major websites today.
[01:06:55.280 --> 01:07:00.280]   So that's a way where people seem to be grabbing everything it can and every which way including
[01:07:00.280 --> 01:07:01.280]   all your mail.
[01:07:01.280 --> 01:07:07.040]   And I don't see them changing by at least through the American customers at all.
[01:07:07.040 --> 01:07:09.920]   And how is this going to affect the black box on the car or anything else?
[01:07:09.920 --> 01:07:15.720]   I don't think that the Europeans, which you do have a lot of privacy limitations, are
[01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:16.920]   going to affect us at all.
[01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:18.760]   We're going to get scammed anyway.
[01:07:18.760 --> 01:07:25.440]   Well, I don't know, remember at the start of the show, Leo, you said that you thought
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:27.240]   I was turning into the next John de Boric.
[01:07:27.240 --> 01:07:30.200]   I don't know where Chris is.
[01:07:30.200 --> 01:07:31.200]   Yes.
[01:07:31.200 --> 01:07:32.200]   All right.
[01:07:32.200 --> 01:07:33.200]   Yes.
[01:07:33.200 --> 01:07:34.200]   Listen to Noah Geneshow.
[01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:35.200]   Noah Geneshow.com.
[01:07:35.200 --> 01:07:38.840]   That's where you'll get the deal.
[01:07:38.840 --> 01:07:42.880]   Delt speaking of deals, Dell, Michael Dell, who's worth 16.
[01:07:42.880 --> 01:07:44.560]   I didn't know he was worth $16 billion.
[01:07:44.560 --> 01:07:45.560]   He's done all right.
[01:07:45.560 --> 01:07:49.240]   Still not enough to take Dell private, he's managed to raise the money.
[01:07:49.240 --> 01:07:52.240]   Some of it from Microsoft, a $2 billion loan.
[01:07:52.240 --> 01:07:54.520]   He only put in 500,000 from what I can tell.
[01:07:54.520 --> 01:07:55.520]   Really?
[01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:56.520]   I mean, 500 million.
[01:07:56.520 --> 01:07:57.520]   500 million.
[01:07:57.520 --> 01:07:58.520]   That's all.
[01:07:58.520 --> 01:07:59.520]   There's a difference.
[01:07:59.520 --> 01:08:01.320]   Well, I mean, if we got a 16 billion.
[01:08:01.320 --> 01:08:05.520]   He's only one 30 second of his entire value.
[01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:10.760]   It says, according to a deal book that he put in 700 million of his fortune.
[01:08:10.760 --> 01:08:13.120]   Oh, I dealt back.
[01:08:13.120 --> 01:08:17.720]   According to Silver Lake, Partners is put in some and Microsoft's loaning them $2 billion
[01:08:17.720 --> 01:08:21.200]   to go private, which is a very interesting thing to do.
[01:08:21.200 --> 01:08:22.200]   I guess.
[01:08:22.200 --> 01:08:23.600]   Public or private, where does Dell go?
[01:08:23.600 --> 01:08:28.800]   Well, that's the question is, is it somehow because you have to reveal the stakeholders,
[01:08:28.800 --> 01:08:32.400]   what you're up to every quarter, is that somehow tying his hands?
[01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:33.560]   That's what they say.
[01:08:33.560 --> 01:08:37.560]   Sarbanes Oxley is keeping him from taking over the computer world.
[01:08:37.560 --> 01:08:38.560]   Is that possible?
[01:08:38.560 --> 01:08:42.240]   Well, if Dell stock is cheap and he believes there's a future, then this is a good way to
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:43.240]   get in there.
[01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:46.240]   He's only buying 700 million.
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:50.240]   I mean, he's hardly putting anything in, to be honest about it.
[01:08:50.240 --> 01:08:51.240]   He's got leverage.
[01:08:51.240 --> 01:08:52.240]   He doesn't have to put it in.
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:55.000]   Yeah, but they're not going to give him the company for the leverage.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.200]   I mean, he's not going to be a 50 million.
[01:08:56.200 --> 01:08:57.200]   He's fine.
[01:08:57.200 --> 01:08:58.200]   He's got plenty of money, but he clearly doesn't.
[01:08:58.200 --> 01:08:59.200]   I think he's bailing out.
[01:08:59.200 --> 01:09:00.440]   You think this is bailing out?
[01:09:00.440 --> 01:09:04.680]   Yeah, it's my opinion because he doesn't seem like he's, I don't know, looks like bailing
[01:09:04.680 --> 01:09:05.680]   out to me.
[01:09:05.680 --> 01:09:07.840]   By taking private is a bailout?
[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:08.840]   And why is Microsoft?
[01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:09.840]   It's one of the money comes to you.
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:10.840]   That's a weird.
[01:09:10.840 --> 01:09:12.720]   Why does Microsoft put in two billion?
[01:09:12.720 --> 01:09:16.640]   Microsoft has to buy his stock and he's going to put a pittance back in.
[01:09:16.640 --> 01:09:19.320]   It looks like you're getting out to me.
[01:09:19.320 --> 01:09:22.160]   There will be 15 billion dollars in debt.
[01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:23.720]   He doesn't care.
[01:09:23.720 --> 01:09:25.480]   Because Silver Lake's only put in a billion.
[01:09:25.480 --> 01:09:27.760]   He doesn't have to be able to take control for a while.
[01:09:27.760 --> 01:09:29.400]   Then he'll be retired in three years.
[01:09:29.400 --> 01:09:30.720]   They would go do something else.
[01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:33.760]   So this is, this is his, this is this is clever.
[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:35.840]   Well, you should be on the board.
[01:09:35.840 --> 01:09:38.240]   I don't want to be on this board.
[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:39.640]   I don't want to be on this board.
[01:09:39.640 --> 01:09:40.640]   So he left for a while.
[01:09:40.640 --> 01:09:44.920]   Remember he came back in 2007 to run the company because it was going into the ground.
[01:09:44.920 --> 01:09:45.920]   He tried to drop it.
[01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:46.920]   He tried to save it.
[01:09:46.920 --> 01:09:47.920]   Didn't work.
[01:09:47.920 --> 01:09:52.520]   Partly because just the margins in the PC industry are so low thanks to the crap book.
[01:09:52.520 --> 01:09:53.520]   I mean the net book.
[01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:57.040]   I've talked to him recently and for the last two or three years he's been trying to tell
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:10:01.640]   everybody who'd listen, which apparently there's nobody, that they're not a PC company
[01:10:01.640 --> 01:10:02.640]   anymore.
[01:10:02.640 --> 01:10:03.960]   The PC thing was only just a little.
[01:10:03.960 --> 01:10:04.960]   That was temporary.
[01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:05.960]   No, it was.
[01:10:05.960 --> 01:10:08.920]   There was big services company that modeled themselves out.
[01:10:08.920 --> 01:10:11.560]   Even Microsoft says it's a services company now.
[01:10:11.560 --> 01:10:14.840]   Yeah, but the media keeps calling him a PC company.
[01:10:14.840 --> 01:10:15.840]   Damn them.
[01:10:15.840 --> 01:10:17.840]   They see stupid media.
[01:10:17.840 --> 01:10:20.480]   They said, what is in the media?
[01:10:20.480 --> 01:10:21.480]   Those idiots in the media.
[01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:22.480]   More runs.
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:24.120]   Don't they know that Dell's a service company?
[01:10:24.120 --> 01:10:27.480]   By the way, Microsoft is a devices and services company.
[01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:29.360]   It says so on their webpage.
[01:10:29.360 --> 01:10:31.600]   Devices and services, see?
[01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:37.680]   I actually wrote the very first post, uh, uh, highlighting the fact that they were making
[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:38.680]   that transition.
[01:10:38.680 --> 01:10:39.680]   Yeah.
[01:10:39.680 --> 01:10:40.680]   Uh, and, but now-
[01:10:40.680 --> 01:10:43.040]   Why is everybody so afraid of being a PC company?
[01:10:43.040 --> 01:10:46.720]   This is the way that all big tech, not all big, but most of the big hardware companies
[01:10:46.720 --> 01:10:47.720]   you know what became a service.
[01:10:47.720 --> 01:10:48.720]   I be a little-
[01:10:48.720 --> 01:10:49.720]   Hold on.
[01:10:49.720 --> 01:10:52.800]   Somebody counter-dicted me in the chat room saying that he's putting all his stock in.
[01:10:52.800 --> 01:10:54.360]   I have not heard this.
[01:10:54.360 --> 01:10:58.320]   If you can give me a link, I'll, I, I re-nig on my assertion that he's getting out of the
[01:10:58.320 --> 01:10:59.320]   company if he's-
[01:10:59.320 --> 01:11:00.640]   Because he wouldn't have anything left.
[01:11:00.640 --> 01:11:01.640]   All his stock in.
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:06.560]   He's betting his entire stake in the company and 700 million in cash.
[01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:11.840]   Well, it gives him some control and maybe some, some insulation about, uh, getting, getting
[01:11:11.840 --> 01:11:12.840]   replaced, right?
[01:11:12.840 --> 01:11:13.840]   He- he-
[01:11:13.840 --> 01:11:14.840]   Oh, maybe that was-
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:17.920]   He gets the investors and then, and then he can run it and he can make decisions without
[01:11:17.920 --> 01:11:19.920]   worrying about the market reacting badly to it.
[01:11:19.920 --> 01:11:20.920]   Right.
[01:11:20.920 --> 01:11:21.920]   He can just stay-
[01:11:21.920 --> 01:11:22.920]   Right.
[01:11:22.920 --> 01:11:23.920]   Because clearly, if you're a PC company-
[01:11:23.920 --> 01:11:25.720]   That's short-term focus.
[01:11:25.720 --> 01:11:26.720]   That's- that's the thing that-
[01:11:26.720 --> 01:11:27.720]   That quarterly focus.
[01:11:27.720 --> 01:11:28.960]   I can't plan ahead.
[01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:29.960]   Yeah.
[01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:32.760]   We have to focus on, you know, this quarter's results.
[01:11:32.760 --> 01:11:33.760]   Right.
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:34.760]   Yeah.
[01:11:34.760 --> 01:11:35.760]   All right.
[01:11:35.760 --> 01:11:36.760]   That's what he does.
[01:11:36.760 --> 01:11:37.760]   What could he do?
[01:11:37.760 --> 01:11:38.760]   What could he do?
[01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:42.920]   He could repackage the company, change the name, you know, then do some IPO, then get
[01:11:42.920 --> 01:11:43.920]   out at that point.
[01:11:43.920 --> 01:11:45.400]   Bring back the Dell dude.
[01:11:45.400 --> 01:11:48.680]   You know, the Dell dude's been in the news wanting to come back.
[01:11:48.680 --> 01:11:51.360]   Well, he said, "I know how to save Dell."
[01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:52.520]   You just bring me back.
[01:11:52.520 --> 01:11:53.520]   Yeah.
[01:11:53.520 --> 01:11:55.080]   They fired him because he was selling pot.
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:56.080]   Yeah.
[01:11:56.080 --> 01:11:57.080]   Right.
[01:11:57.080 --> 01:11:58.080]   Or buying pot.
[01:11:58.080 --> 01:11:59.080]   Something with pot.
[01:11:59.080 --> 01:12:00.080]   Something with pot.
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:02.120]   I know there was a pot involved in there somewhere.
[01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:05.520]   Um, he says, "I can save Dell, dude."
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:08.800]   Uh, Ben Curtis is his name.
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:12.760]   Uh, he was once arrested for trying to buy marijuana in New York.
[01:12:12.760 --> 01:12:18.040]   Um, he says, "I think they're making a huge mistake and they simply need to bring back
[01:12:18.040 --> 01:12:19.040]   the Dell dude.
[01:12:19.040 --> 01:12:20.040]   That's it.
[01:12:20.040 --> 01:12:21.040]   That's all they need to do.
[01:12:21.040 --> 01:12:24.480]   If they brought me back their sales stock and media presence with Sky Rocket."
[01:12:24.480 --> 01:12:26.680]   What's up, Mr. Foster?
[01:12:26.680 --> 01:12:27.680]   Hey.
[01:12:27.680 --> 01:12:29.040]   I go in for a PC.
[01:12:29.040 --> 01:12:30.680]   I come out with a migraine.
[01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:31.840]   You ask for this.
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:33.440]   All they have is that.
[01:12:33.440 --> 01:12:34.440]   Make sure it's been.
[01:12:34.440 --> 01:12:38.120]   Well, your computer quandary is easily solved by the folks at Dell.
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:39.640]   Just call it going online.
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:41.000]   They'll help you figure it out.
[01:12:41.000 --> 01:12:43.000]   So you know what you're getting and what you're getting at.
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:44.000]   Can I ask a question?
[01:12:44.000 --> 01:12:45.840]   Why did they get mad this guy was buying pot?
[01:12:45.840 --> 01:12:47.200]   He's obviously stoned.
[01:12:47.200 --> 01:12:48.200]   He stole that convertible.
[01:12:48.200 --> 01:12:49.200]   I don't know.
[01:12:49.200 --> 01:12:50.200]   I don't know.
[01:12:50.200 --> 01:12:52.640]   I, to be honest with, I thought it was dumb to get rid of him.
[01:12:52.640 --> 01:12:53.640]   Um, right.
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:57.880]   Cause obviously a good marketing campaign makes up for a commodity product.
[01:12:57.880 --> 01:13:00.360]   Uh, Apple, we should talk about Apple.
[01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:04.120]   So why is, uh, by the way, we now know it is legal to jailbreak.
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:05.240]   But illegal to unlock.
[01:13:05.240 --> 01:13:06.240]   This is strange.
[01:13:06.240 --> 01:13:07.240]   This is the library.
[01:13:07.240 --> 01:13:08.240]   What does that even mean?
[01:13:08.240 --> 01:13:09.240]   Yeah.
[01:13:09.240 --> 01:13:12.040]   Librarian of Congress says, no, actually you can't unlock unless you've, I don't know,
[01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:13.640]   you've exceeded your term of service.
[01:13:13.640 --> 01:13:14.640]   Right.
[01:13:14.640 --> 01:13:15.640]   Right.
[01:13:15.640 --> 01:13:16.640]   Yes.
[01:13:16.640 --> 01:13:17.640]   But you can jailbreak.
[01:13:17.640 --> 01:13:19.200]   That's explicitly permitted by the DMCA.
[01:13:19.200 --> 01:13:20.200]   Yep.
[01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:21.200]   Um, what does it even mean?
[01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:22.200]   What's the difference?
[01:13:22.200 --> 01:13:23.200]   Okay.
[01:13:23.200 --> 01:13:26.560]   Jailbreaking gives you access to things that Apple doesn't want you to have access on,
[01:13:26.560 --> 01:13:27.560]   on the devices.
[01:13:27.560 --> 01:13:31.200]   Yeah, you can get, you can add non-approved apps and things like that.
[01:13:31.200 --> 01:13:34.400]   Like specifically means you can change your carrier.
[01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:38.800]   And the idea there is that since you're buying a phone that's subsidized by the carrier,
[01:13:38.800 --> 01:13:41.920]   that for the terms of the, the carrier, you need to stay.
[01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:42.920]   That seems fair.
[01:13:42.920 --> 01:13:44.920]   You need to stay with them, but you can, you can jailbreak it.
[01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:45.920]   That's unfair.
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:47.080]   Except for the fact that carriers are crooks.
[01:13:47.080 --> 01:13:52.720]   So when Apple put out iOS 6.1, it didn't take long for the jailbreak to be updated.
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:57.120]   Evasion, in fact, is now the most popular jailbreak ever.
[01:13:57.120 --> 01:13:58.800]   Seven million iOS devices.
[01:13:58.800 --> 01:13:59.800]   Yeah.
[01:13:59.800 --> 01:14:01.160]   It's really packed in four days.
[01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:07.760]   Now that, that is roughly 0.001% of iOS devices, but it is the first really sort of
[01:14:07.760 --> 01:14:09.360]   stable, non-tethered.
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:12.640]   Could jailbreak iOS 6 before, but you every time you rebooted, you had to plug it back
[01:14:12.640 --> 01:14:14.760]   into a computer by USB.
[01:14:14.760 --> 01:14:16.760]   And now it's a standalone jailbreak again.
[01:14:16.760 --> 01:14:19.080]   So the jailbreak community is celebrating.
[01:14:19.080 --> 01:14:20.080]   How about Apple?
[01:14:20.080 --> 01:14:21.080]   How they feel about it?
[01:14:21.080 --> 01:14:23.720]   You know, I think Apple, Apple posted a tech note that said, don't do this.
[01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:24.720]   Right.
[01:14:24.720 --> 01:14:25.720]   It just is bad.
[01:14:25.720 --> 01:14:26.720]   If you do this, the terrorists win.
[01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:27.720]   We can't support it.
[01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:32.720]   I've heard from app developers is that they've seen a massive increase in piracy as a part
[01:14:32.720 --> 01:14:36.160]   of it because that is part of the jailbreak community is the tools to enable you to easily
[01:14:36.160 --> 01:14:37.840]   pirate apps or are there.
[01:14:37.840 --> 01:14:39.160]   That's not the only reason to jailbreak.
[01:14:39.160 --> 01:14:42.880]   We ran a story on Macworld the other day about why, you know, a lot of our editors do it for
[01:14:42.880 --> 01:14:47.600]   lots of good reasons, but there is also piracy behind a lot of it because it's much easier
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:50.680]   to run pirated apps through jailbreak.
[01:14:50.680 --> 01:14:51.680]   Jailbreak.
[01:14:51.680 --> 01:14:52.680]   Jailbroken.
[01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:53.680]   Jailbroken.
[01:14:53.680 --> 01:14:56.360]   Yeah, record, jailbrack.
[01:14:56.360 --> 01:14:57.520]   Done jail broke done.
[01:14:57.520 --> 01:14:59.200]   Done been jail broke.
[01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:00.200]   Where'd you get them shoes?
[01:15:00.200 --> 01:15:01.200]   I could tell you where you got them shoes.
[01:15:01.200 --> 01:15:02.800]   Do you want to know where you got them shoes?
[01:15:02.800 --> 01:15:03.800]   I don't care.
[01:15:03.800 --> 01:15:04.800]   You got them on your feet.
[01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:05.800]   20 bucks, John.
[01:15:05.800 --> 01:15:08.400]   I'm such an idiot.
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:10.960]   Lisa's even pushing me.
[01:15:10.960 --> 01:15:11.960]   She said, no, no, no.
[01:15:11.960 --> 01:15:12.960]   Don't talk to him.
[01:15:12.960 --> 01:15:17.640]   Said, no, but I want to know how would he know how I got to find out.
[01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:19.640]   I got to know.
[01:15:19.640 --> 01:15:25.680]   Okay, this is a big, big breaking story just happened today.
[01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:27.360]   It's all over Tech meme.
[01:15:27.360 --> 01:15:34.160]   The Nick built in the New York Times, a regular on this show says Apple is developing a curved
[01:15:34.160 --> 01:15:38.560]   smart glass watch, a Dick Tracy watch, if you will.
[01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:41.240]   You know, it's funny because you very elderly people.
[01:15:41.240 --> 01:15:48.400]   Ryan Block of gadget said when Apple pulled the iPod nano out, you know, the small one
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:53.000]   and put it out a big one that no, no, this is Apple saying don't make watches out of
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:54.000]   this.
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:55.480]   We're going to make a watch.
[01:15:55.480 --> 01:15:58.240]   Maybe he was maybe maybe that was a terrible watch though.
[01:15:58.240 --> 01:15:59.480]   I mean, you had to turn it.
[01:15:59.480 --> 01:16:00.480]   It was horrible.
[01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:01.480]   Right.
[01:16:01.480 --> 01:16:02.480]   I mean, it was bad as a watch.
[01:16:02.480 --> 01:16:03.480]   It was bad as a watch.
[01:16:03.480 --> 01:16:04.480]   It was a fine nano, but bad as a watch.
[01:16:04.480 --> 01:16:08.000]   And all the people who had it, all the geeks who had the little, they bought the band.
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:09.720]   It was like their first Kickstarter project.
[01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:10.720]   It really took off.
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:11.720]   Yeah.
[01:16:11.720 --> 01:16:13.280]   The lunatic and all of those.
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:15.640]   And you know, this report is that they're experimenting.
[01:16:15.640 --> 01:16:17.480]   Well, Apple experiments with lots of stuff.
[01:16:17.480 --> 01:16:19.320]   I think it's intriguing.
[01:16:19.320 --> 01:16:21.680]   I think a wearable thing that's really integrated.
[01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:25.480]   I have, I actually have my pebble with me here, which is all you're wearing a pebble.
[01:16:25.480 --> 01:16:26.880]   Mine hasn't come yet.
[01:16:26.880 --> 01:16:29.760]   Well, it's, we'll talk later.
[01:16:29.760 --> 01:16:30.760]   And it's cool.
[01:16:30.760 --> 01:16:31.760]   We're living in the future.
[01:16:31.760 --> 01:16:33.760]   But it's you, you were very early kick started.
[01:16:33.760 --> 01:16:35.480]   Yeah, like April 11th or something like that.
[01:16:35.480 --> 01:16:37.040]   And it's black, which was the first ones.
[01:16:37.040 --> 01:16:38.200]   I got, I'm getting a red one.
[01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:39.200]   That's why.
[01:16:39.200 --> 01:16:40.200]   So you have to wait for the color.
[01:16:40.200 --> 01:16:44.280]   But you know, it's fine, but it's rudimentary because there's only so much that Apple has
[01:16:44.280 --> 01:16:47.280]   integrated into notifications into the Bluetooth stack on iOS.
[01:16:47.280 --> 01:16:51.160]   And Android is differently yet similarly rudimentary.
[01:16:51.160 --> 01:16:53.160]   It's different stuff it doesn't do.
[01:16:53.160 --> 01:16:56.960]   And so the idea is that your phone talks to this watch and says you got a text message
[01:16:56.960 --> 01:16:57.960]   and it is stuff like that.
[01:16:57.960 --> 01:17:01.880]   Yeah, I mean, yeah, somebody sends me a text and my watch, my watch vibrates.
[01:17:01.880 --> 01:17:02.880]   It's not your arm right here.
[01:17:02.880 --> 01:17:03.880]   We get a picture of it.
[01:17:03.880 --> 01:17:06.200]   And it's not huge and awful like I thought it would be.
[01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:07.200]   And I like the E Ink.
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:08.200]   Oh, it's over there.
[01:17:08.200 --> 01:17:09.200]   It's a pretty big watch.
[01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:12.200]   You reach all the way over there.
[01:17:12.200 --> 01:17:13.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:17:13.200 --> 01:17:14.200]   Look at that.
[01:17:14.200 --> 01:17:15.200]   I like the E Ink.
[01:17:15.200 --> 01:17:19.400]   So it's not an E Ink, it's an E paper, which is a much faster refresh.
[01:17:19.400 --> 01:17:21.360]   And you know, it tells the time.
[01:17:21.360 --> 01:17:22.360]   It's not ungodly huge.
[01:17:22.360 --> 01:17:25.840]   I mean, compared to my watch, it's actually tiny.
[01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:26.840]   So there you go.
[01:17:26.840 --> 01:17:27.840]   It's not bad.
[01:17:27.840 --> 01:17:28.840]   And you like it?
[01:17:28.840 --> 01:17:29.840]   I do.
[01:17:29.840 --> 01:17:31.760]   It tells the time that's the most important thing a watch can do.
[01:17:31.760 --> 01:17:34.880]   And then it's got some other features that are that are on the way.
[01:17:34.880 --> 01:17:37.480]   But it's going to be limited to what is supported by the OS's.
[01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:42.120]   And the advantage of an Apple watch would be that Apple would obviously completely integrate
[01:17:42.120 --> 01:17:44.000]   into their operating system.
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:45.000]   It's real estate.
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:47.160]   The wrist real estate is like wide open right now.
[01:17:47.160 --> 01:17:48.160]   Yeah.
[01:17:48.160 --> 01:17:49.160]   Wait a minute.
[01:17:49.160 --> 01:17:50.160]   Wait a minute.
[01:17:50.160 --> 01:17:52.680]   How many of you in our audience are wearing wristwatches right now?
[01:17:52.680 --> 01:17:53.680]   Is there anyone?
[01:17:53.680 --> 01:17:55.320]   Young ones don't wear wristwatches.
[01:17:55.320 --> 01:17:56.320]   Yeah.
[01:17:56.320 --> 01:17:58.240]   No, seriously, how many people are you wearing a wristwatch?
[01:17:58.240 --> 01:17:59.240]   Nope.
[01:17:59.240 --> 01:18:00.240]   That's just a.
[01:18:00.240 --> 01:18:01.240]   See, that's bad.
[01:18:01.240 --> 01:18:02.240]   And there's no advertising.
[01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:03.240]   No, there's there.
[01:18:03.240 --> 01:18:04.240]   Nobody.
[01:18:04.240 --> 01:18:05.240]   Nobody in our audience.
[01:18:05.240 --> 01:18:07.360]   One kid is wearing Eli is our intern.
[01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:11.240]   He's wearing a wristwatch because your phone tells you the time.
[01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:12.240]   Yeah.
[01:18:12.240 --> 01:18:16.680]   Well, I don't like to fish into my pocket and pull it out and orient it properly and press
[01:18:16.680 --> 01:18:17.680]   the button.
[01:18:17.680 --> 01:18:19.200]   And I know that's like two seconds that I've wasted there.
[01:18:19.200 --> 01:18:21.320]   It's not a lot of time in the grand scheme of things.
[01:18:21.320 --> 01:18:24.480]   Look at our, you know, unscientific market survey here.
[01:18:24.480 --> 01:18:25.480]   Nobody in our rights.
[01:18:25.480 --> 01:18:26.480]   It's about 20 people in our rights.
[01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:27.480]   None of them are wearing wristwatches.
[01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:28.480]   The wristwatch market is hurting.
[01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:29.480]   Sure.
[01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:30.480]   It is.
[01:18:30.480 --> 01:18:31.960]   I mean, except for luxury watches actually are not hurting.
[01:18:31.960 --> 01:18:34.240]   No, if it's jewelry, it's different.
[01:18:34.240 --> 01:18:39.080]   But watch a watch or something that says I don't need to wear this.
[01:18:39.080 --> 01:18:40.080]   Right.
[01:18:40.080 --> 01:18:41.480]   It's a 1%er device.
[01:18:41.480 --> 01:18:42.480]   Yes.
[01:18:42.480 --> 01:18:45.520]   But I think there's, I think there's some potential, especially when you look at things like the,
[01:18:45.520 --> 01:18:48.720]   like the Nike, you know, the Nike band and all that now.
[01:18:48.720 --> 01:18:49.720]   Yeah.
[01:18:49.720 --> 01:18:50.720]   Leo's much cooler now.
[01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:51.720]   He's taking off the watch.
[01:18:51.720 --> 01:18:54.160]   I think there's some opportunity if you build in some features for people to say there's
[01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:55.960]   a, it's good to have something on my wrist.
[01:18:55.960 --> 01:18:56.960]   And then ask you this.
[01:18:56.960 --> 01:18:57.960]   I don't have to find my phone.
[01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:00.200]   How long does the battery charge last on that baby?
[01:19:00.200 --> 01:19:01.400]   Well, I've only had it for about four days.
[01:19:01.400 --> 01:19:02.400]   It's supposed to be very good.
[01:19:02.400 --> 01:19:03.800]   But they say it's, it'll last a week.
[01:19:03.800 --> 01:19:04.800]   It's not daily.
[01:19:04.800 --> 01:19:05.800]   It's like a few days.
[01:19:05.800 --> 01:19:07.880]   I take it off at night anyway.
[01:19:07.880 --> 01:19:09.040]   So you're charging it.
[01:19:09.040 --> 01:19:10.040]   Yeah.
[01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:11.040]   Charging it once a week.
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:12.240]   So here's what I want to happen to do.
[01:19:12.240 --> 01:19:16.720]   And actually I wouldn't put it past them because battery with watches is the big problem is
[01:19:16.720 --> 01:19:17.880]   that this is a piece.
[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:22.040]   This is something that you throw into the box with your change and your keys and you
[01:19:22.040 --> 01:19:23.400]   don't want to worry about charging it.
[01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:25.520]   And I had a spot watch for a while.
[01:19:25.520 --> 01:19:26.520]   That was just a joke.
[01:19:26.520 --> 01:19:28.520]   Oh, the spot was a daily.
[01:19:28.520 --> 01:19:29.520]   When?
[01:19:29.520 --> 01:19:30.520]   Yeah.
[01:19:30.520 --> 01:19:33.000]   And I'm watching Apple could Apple could.
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:34.000]   Oh, I'm watching.
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:35.000]   It's gorgeous.
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:36.000]   They never come out.
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:37.000]   Yeah, it didn't.
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:38.000]   It's terrible.
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:39.000]   You know, Bluetooth pairing is awful.
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:40.000]   It doesn't have functionality.
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:42.680]   And the actual limitation pebble is going to suffer, which is if you can't get access
[01:19:42.680 --> 01:19:43.680]   to that information.
[01:19:43.680 --> 01:19:44.680]   Right.
[01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:45.680]   I made it be raised.
[01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:46.680]   For 100 years.
[01:19:46.680 --> 01:19:48.680]   We have had self-winding watches.
[01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:50.240]   Yep.
[01:19:50.240 --> 01:19:52.240]   And cat one of those.
[01:19:52.240 --> 01:19:55.880]   Um, uh, Seiko actually made an electronic self-winding watch.
[01:19:55.880 --> 01:19:57.240]   Like you charge up a battery?
[01:19:57.240 --> 01:19:59.960]   No, no, no, use the, um, the motion of your wrist.
[01:19:59.960 --> 01:20:00.960]   Yeah.
[01:20:00.960 --> 01:20:01.960]   It's called an automatic watch.
[01:20:01.960 --> 01:20:03.960]   As you use the motion of your wrist to turn a flywheel.
[01:20:03.960 --> 01:20:04.960]   Right.
[01:20:04.960 --> 01:20:07.600]   And that flywheel generated in this particular case electricity used to be mechanical power
[01:20:07.600 --> 01:20:08.600]   and now electricity.
[01:20:08.600 --> 01:20:10.560]   If this is self-winding, but it's mechanical.
[01:20:10.560 --> 01:20:11.560]   Right.
[01:20:11.560 --> 01:20:12.560]   Right.
[01:20:12.560 --> 01:20:14.000]   That's energy and that energy could be converted into power.
[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.120]   And I would just, I'm just saying Apple, if you're going to do it, make it self-made.
[01:20:17.120 --> 01:20:19.000]   Make it perpetual, that would be awesome.
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:22.080]   But you have Tim Cook wears a Nike fuel band.
[01:20:22.080 --> 01:20:24.400]   That's a watch as well as a measurement device.
[01:20:24.400 --> 01:20:29.940]   There was at CES, there were quite a few booths for dedicated to bands, straps and
[01:20:29.940 --> 01:20:31.840]   watches that monitor health and drug.
[01:20:31.840 --> 01:20:34.680]   We mean one that did blood oxygen, which I thought was pretty true.
[01:20:34.680 --> 01:20:35.680]   Right.
[01:20:35.680 --> 01:20:38.040]   They're not to use watches, but there are lots of these wearable devices that are tracking
[01:20:38.040 --> 01:20:39.040]   your movement.
[01:20:39.040 --> 01:20:40.160]   It's working as a petometer.
[01:20:40.160 --> 01:20:41.480]   Maybe it's checking your blood oxygen.
[01:20:41.480 --> 01:20:42.480]   Maybe it's checking your pulse.
[01:20:42.480 --> 01:20:46.280]   And Corning has this willow glass that bends.
[01:20:46.280 --> 01:20:47.280]   There's new stuff.
[01:20:47.280 --> 01:20:48.760]   That will curve around.
[01:20:48.760 --> 01:20:51.680]   So this rumor mostly comes from Foxconn.
[01:20:51.680 --> 01:20:55.400]   And so see, that's why it's meaningless because as you said, you'll get the parts and then
[01:20:55.400 --> 01:20:57.400]   try them out and say, "This doesn't work."
[01:20:57.400 --> 01:20:58.400]   It's just a total type.
[01:20:58.400 --> 01:20:59.400]   Right.
[01:20:59.400 --> 01:21:00.840]   I mean, they test lots of crazy stuff out of Apple.
[01:21:00.840 --> 01:21:05.560]   But I do think there's, I mean, Bruce Tognizini, who Togg, who used to be at Apple, is a big
[01:21:05.560 --> 01:21:09.920]   UI guy, wrote a long, long, long, long, very, very, very long.
[01:21:09.920 --> 01:21:12.120]   I can't emphasize how long we are later.
[01:21:12.120 --> 01:21:13.120]   It's very long.
[01:21:13.120 --> 01:21:16.160]   He's about why Apple should do a smartwatch.
[01:21:16.160 --> 01:21:17.800]   And he makes a lot of really good points.
[01:21:17.800 --> 01:21:18.960]   There's a lot of potential there.
[01:21:18.960 --> 01:21:19.960]   How real is it?
[01:21:19.960 --> 01:21:22.840]   It's a better product than a TV.
[01:21:22.840 --> 01:21:23.840]   Maybe.
[01:21:23.840 --> 01:21:24.840]   Maybe.
[01:21:24.840 --> 01:21:25.840]   I think that's a crazy product.
[01:21:25.840 --> 01:21:30.640]   I mean, it would be a nice accessory for them to sell along with iPhones and iPads.
[01:21:30.640 --> 01:21:33.760]   Well, they've got a lot more profit to be made from a TV than a watch.
[01:21:33.760 --> 01:21:34.760]   Is there?
[01:21:34.760 --> 01:21:35.760]   Is there?
[01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:36.760]   Is there, John?
[01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:37.760]   Is there?
[01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:39.760]   Tell that to Sharp.
[01:21:39.760 --> 01:21:42.280]   Tell that to Pioneer.
[01:21:42.280 --> 01:21:43.520]   Tell that to Sony.
[01:21:43.520 --> 01:21:46.360]   The Japanese companies have been going bankrupt making big TV.
[01:21:46.360 --> 01:21:50.960]   Yeah, but they don't have Apple's cache and potential for high margins.
[01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:51.960]   Yeah.
[01:21:51.960 --> 01:21:52.960]   I wonder, though.
[01:21:52.960 --> 01:21:55.920]   I mean, I think the new Apple market is all in these cheap iOS devices.
[01:21:55.920 --> 01:21:59.320]   So you think everything's going downhill to the cheap?
[01:21:59.320 --> 01:22:00.320]   Yeah.
[01:22:00.320 --> 01:22:03.240]   Although, interestingly, and we'll get to in a second, there is a rumor that the Mac Pro
[01:22:03.240 --> 01:22:08.000]   actually is real or something like it or something like it.
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.800]   But first a word from carbonite.com.
[01:22:09.800 --> 01:22:12.160]   If you've got a computer, you got to back it up.
[01:22:12.160 --> 01:22:14.800]   You may put your watch your pebble back on before I steal it.
[01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:16.000]   I ordered the red one.
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.000]   Yeah.
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:18.000]   That's why I don't have it.
[01:22:18.000 --> 01:22:19.000]   That's why you're waiting.
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:20.000]   Fool that I am.
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:21.640]   You're a slave to fashion.
[01:22:21.640 --> 01:22:22.640]   I am.
[01:22:22.640 --> 01:22:23.640]   I am a slave.
[01:22:23.640 --> 01:22:25.920]   You can tell when you look at me, I'm a slave.
[01:22:25.920 --> 01:22:27.560]   It's fashion week here at Twitter.
[01:22:27.560 --> 01:22:28.720]   That's why the table broke.
[01:22:28.720 --> 01:22:29.880]   And that's why there's all the plaid.
[01:22:29.880 --> 01:22:31.440]   I was going to do the catwalk.
[01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:32.440]   Runway.
[01:22:32.440 --> 01:22:32.960]   Plaid's back.
[01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:35.640]   I'm bringing grunge back to tech podcasting.
[01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:38.440]   I'm sorry, I can't cut out podcasting.
[01:22:38.440 --> 01:22:39.440]   Technet casting.
[01:22:39.440 --> 01:22:43.640]   We'll talk about that off the air.
[01:22:43.640 --> 01:22:49.720]   Carbonite.com, it's a backup solution, my friends, that works Mac or PC automatically,
[01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:53.280]   continuously in the background to get your data up on the cloud where it's safe and,
[01:22:53.280 --> 01:22:55.120]   by the way, where you can access it.
[01:22:55.120 --> 01:22:57.560]   Anytime, it's the most affordable cloud storage.
[01:22:57.560 --> 01:22:58.560]   We talk about SkyDrive.
[01:22:58.560 --> 01:22:59.560]   We talk about iCloud.
[01:22:59.560 --> 01:23:05.680]   We talk about Dropbox, but unlimited backup for less than $5 a month for $59 a year.
[01:23:05.680 --> 01:23:06.680]   That's pretty good.
[01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:09.880]   And with their free apps, you could access it anytime or just log on to your Carbonite
[01:23:09.880 --> 01:23:12.280]   account on any computer, get those files.
[01:23:12.280 --> 01:23:14.640]   Plus what disaster happens is very easy to restore them.
[01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:15.920]   Now don't take my word for it.
[01:23:15.920 --> 01:23:17.840]   I want you to try Carbonite right now.
[01:23:17.840 --> 01:23:20.240]   Go to carbonite.com.
[01:23:20.240 --> 01:23:23.360]   Click the try it free button and use our offer code, which is Twitch.
[01:23:23.360 --> 01:23:24.680]   And you get two weeks free.
[01:23:24.680 --> 01:23:25.880]   You don't need a credit card.
[01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:27.440]   You're not going to give many personal information.
[01:23:27.440 --> 01:23:29.360]   Just offer code, Twitch.
[01:23:29.360 --> 01:23:33.760]   If you decide you like it and you then decide to buy it, you'll get two months free, 14
[01:23:33.760 --> 01:23:35.800]   months of the price of 12 when you subscribe.
[01:23:35.800 --> 01:23:39.760]   They do have small business plans, plans for external drives and so forth.
[01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:42.840]   But the basic plan is $59 per computer, flat fee.
[01:23:42.840 --> 01:23:45.240]   They're all flat rate and they're just great.
[01:23:45.240 --> 01:23:47.840]   Carbonite.com, the offer code is Twitch.
[01:23:47.840 --> 01:23:48.840]   Did Ed come back?
[01:23:48.840 --> 01:23:50.520]   Were you turning on a light Ed?
[01:23:50.520 --> 01:23:53.440]   Because now you're just basically a floating balloon head.
[01:23:53.440 --> 01:23:55.440]   Is he there?
[01:23:55.440 --> 01:23:56.440]   There he is.
[01:23:56.440 --> 01:23:57.440]   He's there.
[01:23:57.440 --> 01:23:59.360]   Floating head.
[01:23:59.360 --> 01:24:00.760]   You like working in the dark?
[01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:03.680]   It's one of those days.
[01:24:03.680 --> 01:24:05.160]   Now John's gone.
[01:24:05.160 --> 01:24:06.160]   Yeah.
[01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:08.440]   Yeah, John's decided to turn on the invisibility shield.
[01:24:08.440 --> 01:24:13.840]   I'll tell you what, while John is looking for something he can steal, that's what he
[01:24:13.840 --> 01:24:14.840]   does.
[01:24:14.840 --> 01:24:18.080]   He gets up in the middle of every show and looks for something he can take home.
[01:24:18.080 --> 01:24:19.440]   Usually a bottle.
[01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:21.960]   Did you find anything, John?
[01:24:21.960 --> 01:24:25.520]   Let's take a look at what you missed if you missed Twitch this week.
[01:24:25.520 --> 01:24:28.680]   Previously on Twitch, I5 for the iPhone.
[01:24:28.680 --> 01:24:31.320]   Today is going to be our best show ever.
[01:24:31.320 --> 01:24:32.600]   I just have a feeling.
[01:24:32.600 --> 01:24:37.680]   So please try to keep the voices down because I've got a tiny little super bowl hangover.
[01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:38.680]   Windows Weekly.
[01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:43.760]   I'll be holding up my surface right now and right next to where the magnets are, there
[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:47.680]   are these two weird little connectors and that's what they were talking about.
[01:24:47.680 --> 01:24:51.440]   And they were pretty much hinting like we've got some things coming that might help you
[01:24:51.440 --> 01:24:52.800]   with your battery life on this.
[01:24:52.800 --> 01:24:58.000]   Yeah, there are little connection plates in there that don't exist in the RT version.
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:00.440]   Before you buy, let's say you're zoned out.
[01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:01.440]   What happens to the years they fall?
[01:25:01.440 --> 01:25:02.920]   Then they just kind of flop down.
[01:25:02.920 --> 01:25:03.920]   They fall over.
[01:25:03.920 --> 01:25:06.440]   Yeah, they relax and they just bend over to the sides.
[01:25:06.440 --> 01:25:10.360]   And you're obviously very interested in what's going on.
[01:25:10.360 --> 01:25:11.360]   Gizwiz.
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:13.720]   One, two, three.
[01:25:13.720 --> 01:25:15.720]   Whoa!
[01:25:15.720 --> 01:25:18.240]   That's the human slingshot.
[01:25:18.240 --> 01:25:27.960]   After the show, we're going to try it.
[01:25:27.960 --> 01:25:31.880]   They just, Webb, 27, 88, and the chairman just pointed out, Sarah's going to be kind
[01:25:31.880 --> 01:25:34.720]   of mad when she realizes I broke her table.
[01:25:34.720 --> 01:25:36.040]   This is what she uses for I-5.
[01:25:36.040 --> 01:25:37.040]   That's good.
[01:25:37.040 --> 01:25:38.040]   It could be in trouble.
[01:25:38.040 --> 01:25:41.360]   I think you would think of the repercussions.
[01:25:41.360 --> 01:25:46.360]   So there's a reseller who says, "Mac Forever."
[01:25:46.360 --> 01:25:51.320]   People apparently told, this is in Mac Forever, France C-STEMs, a new range of Mac Pro will
[01:25:51.320 --> 01:25:55.600]   be released in spring 2013.
[01:25:55.600 --> 01:25:57.080]   This is like third hand.
[01:25:57.080 --> 01:25:58.880]   Did Tim Cook already say that?
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:25:59.880]   No, no.
[01:25:59.880 --> 01:26:05.800]   What he said was a little, he said, "In 2013, there will be a product that makes Mac Pro
[01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:06.800]   users happy."
[01:26:06.800 --> 01:26:08.960]   That's not necessarily a Mac Pro.
[01:26:08.960 --> 01:26:12.640]   No, I think he very specifically didn't say it was going to be a Mac Pro.
[01:26:12.640 --> 01:26:14.640]   It might be, but it might be something new that replaces-
[01:26:14.640 --> 01:26:15.640]   New keyboard.
[01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:17.000]   But Cheesegrader has been around for a year.
[01:26:17.000 --> 01:26:18.000]   It could be the iMac.
[01:26:18.000 --> 01:26:20.320]   It could be that iMac that's an iMac.
[01:26:20.320 --> 01:26:21.320]   That should make you happy.
[01:26:21.320 --> 01:26:23.080]   Well, iMac, iMac Pro, graphic boards.
[01:26:23.080 --> 01:26:27.000]   There'll be a pro-something that speaks to the pro users.
[01:26:27.000 --> 01:26:28.000]   They will do that.
[01:26:28.000 --> 01:26:29.000]   And spring is not the best.
[01:26:29.000 --> 01:26:30.480]   WDC is around that time.
[01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:31.480]   It could be WWDC.
[01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:35.480]   But I think that report is not coming from anywhere other than some assumptions about-
[01:26:35.480 --> 01:26:41.760]   What's odd is that in Europe, the Cheesegrader Pro is illegal.
[01:26:41.760 --> 01:26:42.760]   It's gone.
[01:26:42.760 --> 01:26:43.760]   Yes, they stopped selling it.
[01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:44.760]   In Europe.
[01:26:44.760 --> 01:26:45.600]   Like last week.
[01:26:45.600 --> 01:26:47.600]   It's so un-
[01:26:47.600 --> 01:26:50.320]   This is my turf.
[01:26:50.320 --> 01:26:52.600]   This is old school for me.
[01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:54.760]   It's so old and un-upgraded over the years.
[01:26:54.760 --> 01:26:57.880]   The Mac Pro and all Mac Pro users saw about this.
[01:26:57.880 --> 01:27:01.640]   That even the most recent upgrade was not much of an upgrade.
[01:27:01.640 --> 01:27:05.760]   It's so old that the electrical stuff in it is now against EU regulations.
[01:27:05.760 --> 01:27:12.760]   The fan doesn't have protection.
[01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:14.680]   You could hurt yourself with the blade.
[01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:16.280]   Does the hand crank still work on it?
[01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:18.800]   The hand crank works fine, but it could backfire on you.
[01:27:18.800 --> 01:27:21.800]   And then it would break you down.
[01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:28.880]   It's amendment one of regulation IE 60950 stroke one, second edition, which becomes effective
[01:27:28.880 --> 01:27:29.880]   March 1st.
[01:27:29.880 --> 01:27:30.880]   Classic.
[01:27:30.880 --> 01:27:33.600]   That's where the app wants to do something.
[01:27:33.600 --> 01:27:35.240]   This is such bureaucracy.
[01:27:35.240 --> 01:27:39.840]   And yet the funniest thing is Apple didn't decline to fix it.
[01:27:39.840 --> 01:27:41.360]   They just said, yeah, well, whatever.
[01:27:41.360 --> 01:27:42.720]   That's because they're bringing out a new product.
[01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:44.160]   Yeah, they'll be a new product.
[01:27:44.160 --> 01:27:47.680]   It's so old that they've obviously moved on and all they've all they've been doing is
[01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:51.080]   replacing the processors in every year or two.
[01:27:51.080 --> 01:27:53.440]   It doesn't do Thunderbolt even now.
[01:27:53.440 --> 01:27:58.080]   But Apple does need a super high-end device for content producers.
[01:27:58.080 --> 01:28:02.960]   There's a lot of feeling though in the pro world that Apple is leaving them behind because
[01:28:02.960 --> 01:28:03.960]   of Final Cut and so forth.
[01:28:03.960 --> 01:28:04.960]   You don't think so.
[01:28:04.960 --> 01:28:08.600]   I knew of one of the things when they were placed on this product.
[01:28:08.600 --> 01:28:11.080]   The new Final Cut is an amateur hour.
[01:28:11.080 --> 01:28:12.080]   Yeah.
[01:28:12.080 --> 01:28:13.240]   A lot of pro editors are moving to premiere.
[01:28:13.240 --> 01:28:14.880]   But Apple makes their money on hardware.
[01:28:14.880 --> 01:28:20.720]   So if there's a really good piece of software from somebody else and they have to buy Mac
[01:28:20.720 --> 01:28:23.160]   Pro 2's or whatever they are, Apple's happy.
[01:28:23.160 --> 01:28:24.600]   And boy, they are making money.
[01:28:24.600 --> 01:28:29.360]   Now they're saying they may accelerate cash returns to investors.
[01:28:29.360 --> 01:28:32.160]   They're getting sued.
[01:28:32.160 --> 01:28:33.160]   They're right.
[01:28:33.160 --> 01:28:34.160]   The investors say, well, OK.
[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:35.160]   Hurry up.
[01:28:35.160 --> 01:28:36.160]   You got all those money.
[01:28:36.160 --> 01:28:37.320]   Let's get some of it from you.
[01:28:37.320 --> 01:28:40.760]   They have a huge amount of cash in hand.
[01:28:40.760 --> 01:28:43.880]   Apple may be able to mend its own platinum coin with all that cash.
[01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:45.400]   Oh my goodness.
[01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:47.880]   But it's, you know, no, let's not.
[01:28:47.880 --> 01:28:48.880]   What's this?
[01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:49.880]   What?
[01:28:49.880 --> 01:28:50.880]   What?
[01:28:50.880 --> 01:28:51.880]   The coins?
[01:28:51.880 --> 01:28:52.880]   Whoa.
[01:28:52.880 --> 01:28:53.880]   The ones that are being hijacked to show.
[01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:54.880]   No, it's already been hijacked.
[01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:55.880]   Whoa.
[01:28:55.880 --> 01:28:56.880]   Amazon's got a lot of cash.
[01:28:56.880 --> 01:28:57.880]   Amazon's doing coins?
[01:28:57.880 --> 01:28:58.880]   Amazon has coins too.
[01:28:58.880 --> 01:28:59.880]   There are lots of coins out there.
[01:28:59.880 --> 01:29:00.880]   What are you talking about?
[01:29:00.880 --> 01:29:03.880]   Amazon coins steroids for the Amazon App Store.
[01:29:03.880 --> 01:29:07.120]   Their own script, company store.
[01:29:07.120 --> 01:29:08.120]   By Amazon.
[01:29:08.120 --> 01:29:09.920]   Eventually they're going to be their own country.
[01:29:09.920 --> 01:29:10.920]   That's my theory.
[01:29:10.920 --> 01:29:11.920]   And no sales tax.
[01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:12.920]   Yeah.
[01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:13.920]   In your own country.
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:14.920]   They're not physical coins.
[01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:17.600]   Those Amazon bankers are going to become Amazon POD hotels.
[01:29:17.600 --> 01:29:19.240]   What were embassies for the Amazon company?
[01:29:19.240 --> 01:29:22.840]   Microsoft has been doing this for ages with Xbox points.
[01:29:22.840 --> 01:29:23.840]   So Xbox.
[01:29:23.840 --> 01:29:24.840]   Yes.
[01:29:24.840 --> 01:29:25.840]   Right.
[01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:28.320]   You buy credits that don't exactly equal dollars or cents.
[01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:29.320]   Right.
[01:29:29.320 --> 01:29:31.120]   And the pitch is for your kids.
[01:29:31.120 --> 01:29:34.680]   So you can get your kid this limited amount, this fund.
[01:29:34.680 --> 01:29:36.400]   And they don't have to have a credit card.
[01:29:36.400 --> 01:29:37.720]   And then they can buy this stuff.
[01:29:37.720 --> 01:29:40.960]   But the real value is you don't know what you're spending.
[01:29:40.960 --> 01:29:45.000]   And you have to spend it in chunks so you end up buying more than you ever need.
[01:29:45.000 --> 01:29:46.800]   The real value is that the money is in this account.
[01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:48.680]   It can only be used for things at this particular store.
[01:29:48.680 --> 01:29:50.480]   So you might as well spend down the account.
[01:29:50.480 --> 01:29:52.000]   It's absolutely brilliant.
[01:29:52.000 --> 01:29:53.200]   Facebook did this for a while.
[01:29:53.200 --> 01:29:54.800]   But didn't they discontinue the credits?
[01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:56.960]   I think strip places do this.
[01:29:56.960 --> 01:29:57.960]   Strip joints.
[01:29:57.960 --> 01:29:58.960]   Strip joints.
[01:29:58.960 --> 01:29:59.960]   Yeah.
[01:29:59.960 --> 01:30:00.960]   People works for them.
[01:30:00.960 --> 01:30:01.960]   People are there.
[01:30:01.960 --> 01:30:02.960]   They give you some tokens.
[01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:04.600]   And then you can't use them for anything else.
[01:30:04.600 --> 01:30:05.600]   You guys will come back.
[01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:06.600]   You can't take them home.
[01:30:06.600 --> 01:30:07.600]   Yeah.
[01:30:07.600 --> 01:30:08.600]   That's right.
[01:30:08.600 --> 01:30:11.000]   I'll tell you, the wife doesn't like it when you got those lessy lady coins in your pocket.
[01:30:11.000 --> 01:30:13.400]   It's easy to spend those by accident.
[01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:15.760]   But every coin costs one cent.
[01:30:15.760 --> 01:30:16.760]   So 99 coins.
[01:30:16.760 --> 01:30:17.760]   Oh, now.
[01:30:17.760 --> 01:30:18.760]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:30:18.760 --> 01:30:19.760]   These are your Amazon.
[01:30:19.760 --> 01:30:22.240]   You're now back on Amazon coins because we were really going with that strip thing.
[01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:23.240]   Sorry.
[01:30:23.240 --> 01:30:25.240]   That was a lot more fun.
[01:30:25.240 --> 01:30:27.080]   Amazon coins one per penny.
[01:30:27.080 --> 01:30:28.080]   Correct.
[01:30:28.080 --> 01:30:31.720]   And only spend them on digital content, apps and in-app purchases.
[01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:32.720]   I hate this idea.
[01:30:32.720 --> 01:30:35.600]   And you have to buy them ahead of time, right?
[01:30:35.600 --> 01:30:37.520]   That's why anybody do this.
[01:30:37.520 --> 01:30:38.520]   Why would anybody do this?
[01:30:38.520 --> 01:30:41.120]   People for whom credit cards are an issue.
[01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:42.960]   Amazon's going for the unbanked.
[01:30:42.960 --> 01:30:47.360]   Amazon also says we're giving away tens of millions of coins.
[01:30:47.360 --> 01:30:48.560]   Those are giving them away.
[01:30:48.560 --> 01:30:49.560]   As well as selling them.
[01:30:49.560 --> 01:30:54.400]   Oh, so instead of making it bad for customers, they're going to make it bad for their app
[01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:55.400]   developers and stuff.
[01:30:55.400 --> 01:30:58.400]   No, good point.
[01:30:58.400 --> 01:31:02.600]   They'll give people a big discount when they get started to encourage people to use them.
[01:31:02.600 --> 01:31:03.760]   Then people will have these accounts.
[01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:07.360]   They're going to want to spend them instead of spending buying their content from Apple
[01:31:07.360 --> 01:31:08.360]   or the Pro-New-A or whatever.
[01:31:08.360 --> 01:31:11.480]   This is the FAQ on developer.amazon.com.
[01:31:11.480 --> 01:31:14.240]   Amazon coins are a new virtual currency.
[01:31:14.240 --> 01:31:19.800]   The customers will be able to use to purchase apps, games and in-app items on Kindle Fire.
[01:31:19.800 --> 01:31:20.800]   Was those fire only?
[01:31:20.800 --> 01:31:23.800]   Well, who uses that piece of crap?
[01:31:23.800 --> 01:31:25.800]   You liked it when it was on the show.
[01:31:25.800 --> 01:31:27.440]   Why is this a good idea?
[01:31:27.440 --> 01:31:29.360]   Are people having frauds with money?
[01:31:29.360 --> 01:31:33.320]   Developers receive the same royalty payments no matter what payment method is used.
[01:31:33.320 --> 01:31:34.320]   One coin, one cent.
[01:31:34.320 --> 01:31:37.680]   If an app costs $299, it'll be $299 Amazon coins.
[01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:41.760]   We'll pay the developer their share of $299 Amazon coins.
[01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:45.600]   What does the people do have a problem with credit cards?
[01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:48.120]   That is, you know, outside the US.
[01:31:48.120 --> 01:31:53.720]   There's a real elitist streak that goes on in our industry because we all make good
[01:31:53.720 --> 01:31:59.440]   money and we have credit cards and we think that, you know, that all we do is type in
[01:31:59.440 --> 01:32:00.440]   a credit card number.
[01:32:00.440 --> 01:32:01.440]   Right.
[01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:02.440]   How do you buy coins?
[01:32:02.440 --> 01:32:03.440]   That's a good idea.
[01:32:03.440 --> 01:32:04.440]   That's a good idea.
[01:32:04.440 --> 01:32:05.440]   That's a good idea.
[01:32:05.440 --> 01:32:06.440]   How do you buy the coins?
[01:32:06.440 --> 01:32:08.600]   There's no Amazon store you can walk into and buy coins.
[01:32:08.600 --> 01:32:11.720]   You know, if you have to go, what's the difference between going to the store and buying an
[01:32:11.720 --> 01:32:17.120]   Amazon gift card and putting it in and redeeming it and going and getting a card for coins?
[01:32:17.120 --> 01:32:18.120]   There's no difference.
[01:32:18.120 --> 01:32:19.480]   It's just on their payment method.
[01:32:19.480 --> 01:32:21.440]   It's not.
[01:32:21.440 --> 01:32:22.760]   It's another payment method.
[01:32:22.760 --> 01:32:27.880]   It's also potentially anonymous.
[01:32:27.880 --> 01:32:34.040]   But there are a lot of people that most e-commerce today is based on credit cards.
[01:32:34.040 --> 01:32:38.120]   Another digital divide issue here, there are a lot of people for whom credit cards are
[01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:39.120]   not an option.
[01:32:39.120 --> 01:32:43.360]   But how do you buy the Amazon coins if you don't have a credit card?
[01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:49.200]   You do a transfer directly from your bank or from PayPal or something like that.
[01:32:49.200 --> 01:32:53.680]   You do or from a debit card.
[01:32:53.680 --> 01:32:58.040]   There are a lot of online sites that won't take debit cards right now.
[01:32:58.040 --> 01:33:02.240]   I get this all the time from people who were trying to buy my books who said they couldn't
[01:33:02.240 --> 01:33:07.400]   because the only option was a credit card and that wasn't an option for them.
[01:33:07.400 --> 01:33:10.000]   Now you can order Domino's Pizza with Bitcoins.
[01:33:10.000 --> 01:33:11.600]   Did you know that?
[01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:12.840]   I had no idea.
[01:33:12.840 --> 01:33:14.640]   Pizzaforcoins.com.
[01:33:14.640 --> 01:33:16.280]   Wow.
[01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:20.600]   And maybe the pizza will arrive and maybe it won't.
[01:33:20.600 --> 01:33:21.960]   And maybe it'll be good.
[01:33:21.960 --> 01:33:22.960]   No wait a minute.
[01:33:22.960 --> 01:33:23.960]   That won't happen.
[01:33:23.960 --> 01:33:24.960]   It's Domino's.
[01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:25.960]   Come on.
[01:33:25.960 --> 01:33:27.520]   Let's not get crazy.
[01:33:27.520 --> 01:33:29.440]   That's who should be hired the Dell dude.
[01:33:29.440 --> 01:33:30.440]   I'm so high.
[01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:32.440]   Anything that tastes good right now.
[01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:34.080]   I could use a Domino's.
[01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:35.600]   You should be on their board.
[01:33:35.600 --> 01:33:36.600]   You should.
[01:33:36.600 --> 01:33:37.840]   Domino's board.
[01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:41.560]   You can get two medium, two topping pizzas for .71 Bitcoins.
[01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:44.360]   Is that what the price is now?
[01:33:44.360 --> 01:33:47.720]   199 Amazon coins.
[01:33:47.720 --> 01:33:49.160]   That's about 15 bucks.
[01:33:49.160 --> 01:33:52.640]   So it's actually cheaper than paying a saw box.
[01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:55.000]   What do you call American money?
[01:33:55.000 --> 01:33:56.000]   Greenbacks.
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:57.000]   Greenbacks.
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:58.000]   That's the word I'm looking for.
[01:33:58.000 --> 01:33:59.520]   Anybody ever call it that anymore?
[01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:01.440]   Back in the day they did.
[01:34:01.440 --> 01:34:02.440]   Sawbucks.
[01:34:02.440 --> 01:34:03.440]   Finns.
[01:34:03.440 --> 01:34:05.920]   There's an awful lot of brain here.
[01:34:05.920 --> 01:34:06.920]   Finns $5.
[01:34:06.920 --> 01:34:07.920]   Sawbucks is at 20 right?
[01:34:07.920 --> 01:34:08.920]   I don't know.
[01:34:08.920 --> 01:34:10.640]   Maybe two bits to a quarter.
[01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:11.640]   Yeah.
[01:34:11.640 --> 01:34:13.360]   What else?
[01:34:13.360 --> 01:34:14.360]   Come on historian.
[01:34:14.360 --> 01:34:16.920]   A, what's the 100 call?
[01:34:16.920 --> 01:34:17.920]   It's called something.
[01:34:17.920 --> 01:34:18.920]   Franklin.
[01:34:18.920 --> 01:34:19.920]   A Benjamin.
[01:34:19.920 --> 01:34:20.920]   See no.
[01:34:20.920 --> 01:34:21.920]   See no.
[01:34:21.920 --> 01:34:22.920]   I like the Benjamin.
[01:34:22.920 --> 01:34:23.920]   I think the Benjamin.
[01:34:23.920 --> 01:34:24.920]   Nobody uses Benjamin.
[01:34:24.920 --> 01:34:25.920]   Nobody uses Benjamin.
[01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:26.920]   Nobody uses Benjamin.
[01:34:26.920 --> 01:34:28.920]   It's all about the Benjamin's baby.
[01:34:28.920 --> 01:34:29.920]   See no it's his baby.
[01:34:29.920 --> 01:34:31.880]   Have you seen that really stupid meme?
[01:34:31.880 --> 01:34:32.880]   What is it?
[01:34:32.880 --> 01:34:33.880]   The Harlem Shake?
[01:34:33.880 --> 01:34:35.800]   When somebody explained that to me.
[01:34:35.800 --> 01:34:36.800]   Explain it to us.
[01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:37.800]   What are you talking about?
[01:34:37.800 --> 01:34:38.800]   This week on Twitter.
[01:34:38.800 --> 01:34:39.800]   Old men discuss old men.
[01:34:39.800 --> 01:34:44.040]   Old men joke about old ideas.
[01:34:44.040 --> 01:34:46.040]   They don't know anything.
[01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:48.040]   It's gray hair and green backs.
[01:34:48.040 --> 01:34:50.520]   This week on Twitch.
[01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:52.680]   So the idea is this is based on what?
[01:34:52.680 --> 01:34:58.920]   This is a song by a, it's a dance that can't, why am I getting an ad for Smoosh?
[01:34:58.920 --> 01:34:59.920]   What is this?
[01:34:59.920 --> 01:35:00.920]   Smosh.
[01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:01.920]   Smosh.
[01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:02.920]   What the what it?
[01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:03.920]   How do I close it?
[01:35:03.920 --> 01:35:04.920]   It's a takeover ad.
[01:35:04.920 --> 01:35:07.960]   The latest thing is you get the little bottom of the bottom.
[01:35:07.960 --> 01:35:10.360]   I'm going to use new Smosh.
[01:35:10.360 --> 01:35:11.360]   And you're gone.
[01:35:11.360 --> 01:35:12.360]   Now I don't know.
[01:35:12.360 --> 01:35:13.360]   Sucker.
[01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:14.360]   Why did I do that?
[01:35:14.360 --> 01:35:15.360]   Okay now I'm gone.
[01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:16.360]   I'm gone.
[01:35:16.360 --> 01:35:17.360]   What happens to the thing?
[01:35:17.360 --> 01:35:18.360]   Chads a young person.
[01:35:18.360 --> 01:35:21.000]   Can you help us out with this thing?
[01:35:21.000 --> 01:35:24.440]   How did you just say good work?
[01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:28.600]   So on the internet you Google Harlem Shake and then.
[01:35:28.600 --> 01:35:29.600]   On the internet.
[01:35:29.600 --> 01:35:30.600]   Yeah.
[01:35:30.600 --> 01:35:31.600]   You just watched that.
[01:35:31.600 --> 01:35:32.600]   Yeah.
[01:35:32.600 --> 01:35:33.600]   It's pretty crazy.
[01:35:33.600 --> 01:35:37.160]   So Harlem Shake is this it's it's literally eight days old.
[01:35:37.160 --> 01:35:40.920]   The first Harlem Shake video which is this weird one right here.
[01:35:40.920 --> 01:35:41.920]   Okay.
[01:35:41.920 --> 01:35:42.920]   Was up.
[01:35:42.920 --> 01:35:43.920]   So it's this song.
[01:35:43.920 --> 01:35:45.440]   You have to be in it.
[01:35:45.440 --> 01:35:49.760]   Yeah it was uploaded on February February 2nd there.
[01:35:49.760 --> 01:35:51.680]   Yeah they're powering.
[01:35:51.680 --> 01:35:52.680]   Yeah.
[01:35:52.680 --> 01:35:57.200]   So they're doing a dance that was big in Harlem 20 years ago called the Harlem Shake.
[01:35:57.200 --> 01:35:58.200]   To a.
[01:35:58.200 --> 01:35:59.200]   You know that for a fact.
[01:35:59.200 --> 01:36:02.360]   To a song that was created by what this guy named Bower.
[01:36:02.360 --> 01:36:05.000]   It looks rather suggestive.
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:09.080]   Yeah there's always an edge of these guys that got issues.
[01:36:09.080 --> 01:36:10.560]   I don't get it.
[01:36:10.560 --> 01:36:12.520]   So that was the first one.
[01:36:12.520 --> 01:36:15.240]   And then it always starts out in a normal environment.
[01:36:15.240 --> 01:36:19.720]   There's like an office one right at the maker space where it's a normal environment but
[01:36:19.720 --> 01:36:23.080]   there's one guy doing this stupid dance.
[01:36:23.080 --> 01:36:26.660]   And then for some reason that it's completely unknown everybody's dancing and then it's
[01:36:26.660 --> 01:36:29.160]   over like at 15 seconds the world's shortest.
[01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:30.320]   Thank goodness for that.
[01:36:30.320 --> 01:36:31.320]   Yeah.
[01:36:31.320 --> 01:36:32.320]   I wish it was.
[01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:33.320]   We salute you.
[01:36:33.320 --> 01:36:34.320]   Yeah.
[01:36:34.320 --> 01:36:35.320]   Do you have the office one?
[01:36:35.320 --> 01:36:37.680]   Yeah so well here let me find the office one.
[01:36:37.680 --> 01:36:40.280]   We're in Norwegian army version is the best.
[01:36:40.280 --> 01:36:41.280]   Here's the office one.
[01:36:41.280 --> 01:36:42.280]   This is pretty good.
[01:36:42.280 --> 01:36:44.240]   This is a make this is like a maker space.
[01:36:44.240 --> 01:36:45.240]   So one guy's dancing.
[01:36:45.240 --> 01:36:51.080]   In a motorcycle helmet of course because this is dangerous.
[01:36:51.080 --> 01:36:53.480]   Don't try this without protection.
[01:36:53.480 --> 01:36:59.080]   And then the drop happens in the song right.
[01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:01.440]   And then they're all dancing.
[01:37:01.440 --> 01:37:04.040]   They're faunching what stuff to write.
[01:37:04.040 --> 01:37:05.040]   Interesting about this.
[01:37:05.040 --> 01:37:06.800]   It's easier with an iPad.
[01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:07.800]   Yeah.
[01:37:07.800 --> 01:37:09.800]   Okay just shoot me.
[01:37:09.800 --> 01:37:11.560]   No that's pretty bad.
[01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:12.560]   NERDS.
[01:37:12.560 --> 01:37:13.560]   Come on beyond.
[01:37:13.560 --> 01:37:17.880]   We got somebody behind us here doing the same thing hoping to get attention.
[01:37:17.880 --> 01:37:23.440]   That's I think he's it said that's our intern.
[01:37:23.440 --> 01:37:24.440]   That's Eli.
[01:37:24.440 --> 01:37:25.440]   Eli.
[01:37:25.440 --> 01:37:26.440]   He doesn't know any better.
[01:37:26.440 --> 01:37:27.440]   He's a high school student.
[01:37:27.440 --> 01:37:28.840]   He thinks it's a cool idea.
[01:37:28.840 --> 01:37:29.840]   Yeah he does.
[01:37:29.840 --> 01:37:36.840]   I'm never dead.
[01:37:36.840 --> 01:37:47.840]   I'm going to.
[01:37:47.840 --> 01:37:51.480]   Oh so.
[01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:53.000]   Well edited.
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:55.280]   A genius.
[01:37:55.280 --> 01:37:58.440]   A genius is edited that thing.
[01:37:58.440 --> 01:37:59.440]   Definitely got it right.
[01:37:59.440 --> 01:38:00.440]   The table.
[01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:01.440]   Still broken.
[01:38:01.440 --> 01:38:02.440]   Yeah.
[01:38:02.440 --> 01:38:06.040]   Google says self-driving cars three to five years from now.
[01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:07.040]   That's a little good.
[01:38:07.040 --> 01:38:08.040]   It's a little aggressive.
[01:38:08.040 --> 01:38:09.040]   They're already here.
[01:38:09.040 --> 01:38:10.040]   No they're not.
[01:38:10.040 --> 01:38:11.040]   No they are.
[01:38:11.040 --> 01:38:12.040]   No they are.
[01:38:12.040 --> 01:38:13.040]   You two really disagree on this.
[01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:14.040]   They tell you.
[01:38:14.040 --> 01:38:15.640]   It's a little aggressive they're already here.
[01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:18.000]   No I went to a lecture that Google guy.
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:19.560]   He gave one over at the Autodesk.
[01:38:19.560 --> 01:38:22.080]   They do once a month they give these lectures.
[01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:24.720]   And the guy says right now they can go 50,000.
[01:38:24.720 --> 01:38:28.680]   Right now the model is 50,000 miles without an incident.
[01:38:28.680 --> 01:38:35.400]   They have to get it way over a hundred thousand to close to 300,000 miles to make the cars
[01:38:35.400 --> 01:38:36.400]   so they were actually safe.
[01:38:36.400 --> 01:38:37.840]   But haven't they gotten to that number?
[01:38:37.840 --> 01:38:39.800]   No 50,000 is their number.
[01:38:39.800 --> 01:38:41.720]   So have they gone 50,000 miles yet?
[01:38:41.720 --> 01:38:43.720]   Oh boy they've done over a hundred thousand.
[01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:45.000]   So we're waiting for the first.
[01:38:45.000 --> 01:38:46.880]   There've been a couple of incidents but no.
[01:38:46.880 --> 01:38:48.440]   Always because of a human.
[01:38:48.440 --> 01:38:50.640]   No no this is the car itself making a mistake.
[01:38:50.640 --> 01:38:51.640]   Oh really.
[01:38:51.640 --> 01:38:55.560]   Anyway the point is that they are already that self-driving cars it's not a matter of
[01:38:55.560 --> 01:38:58.000]   well wake up one day and boom you can buy a self-driving car.
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:02.400]   Right now you can buy a car that has lane departure correction, automatic cruise control,
[01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:03.400]   automatic threats.
[01:39:03.400 --> 01:39:06.200]   Right right now cruise control automatic parallel parking.
[01:39:06.200 --> 01:39:11.360]   I had another meeting with Ford and talked to their guy that's apparently their consultants
[01:39:11.360 --> 01:39:13.840]   from the University of California is a transportation guy.
[01:39:13.840 --> 01:39:17.440]   He says this is all bulk, this guy by the way I think is wrong.
[01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:21.160]   He says all bulk crap it'll never work is this and that and the other thing.
[01:39:21.160 --> 01:39:25.680]   And he went on and Ford by the way refuses to buy into this and they say no.
[01:39:25.680 --> 01:39:27.040]   Network cars are the way to go.
[01:39:27.040 --> 01:39:29.200]   It's the company line and I've heard it.
[01:39:29.200 --> 01:39:33.800]   I've heard Alan what's his name the CEO Ford say this many times when asked I always ask
[01:39:33.800 --> 01:39:37.400]   him whenever I see him autonomous cars he says no no people like to drive.
[01:39:37.400 --> 01:39:39.480]   I think it's like Steve Jobs saying nobody wants video.
[01:39:39.480 --> 01:39:41.680]   I think there's some misdirection going on.
[01:39:41.680 --> 01:39:45.000]   I think frankly Ford's got a big R&D going on.
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:46.120]   Oh no they're I'm sure they do but.
[01:39:46.120 --> 01:39:47.360]   And they really want to do a title.
[01:39:47.360 --> 01:39:48.360]   I don't think they do.
[01:39:48.360 --> 01:39:49.360]   I really think there's nothing.
[01:39:49.360 --> 01:39:53.160]   It's not in their interest you know why because people buy there's we how many cars per person
[01:39:53.160 --> 01:39:55.400]   do we buy we buy way too many cars autonomous vehicles.
[01:39:55.400 --> 01:39:56.400]   They'll eliminate that.
[01:39:56.400 --> 01:39:57.400]   No the time and the time.
[01:39:57.400 --> 01:39:59.120]   Oh yes why you got that.
[01:39:59.120 --> 01:40:06.280]   No no no that this is the promise of autonomous vehicles is it ends individual ownership.
[01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:08.840]   It ends like just call for a car and it comes to your house.
[01:40:08.840 --> 01:40:12.280]   Yeah why would you go in a car you don't push your button on your yeah I have phone
[01:40:12.280 --> 01:40:16.320]   of you cars there you jump in a truck if you need a pickup tomorrow you get a pickup if
[01:40:16.320 --> 01:40:20.880]   you need a RV you get an RV you want to go somewhere and have an RV you go there in the
[01:40:20.880 --> 01:40:24.600]   car you get the Santa Fe you have the RV it's all autonomous.
[01:40:24.600 --> 01:40:26.920]   And so and it's totally the future.
[01:40:26.920 --> 01:40:30.960]   This is an actual this this is a risk to their business I think.
[01:40:30.960 --> 01:40:32.320]   So maybe they don't want this.
[01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:35.440]   Well I mean they can still be building cars but they're going to be boxes nobody's going
[01:40:35.440 --> 01:40:36.440]   to care what they look like.
[01:40:36.440 --> 01:40:40.800]   I do think people like yourself the other ones with the high income and lots of money.
[01:40:40.800 --> 01:40:41.800]   People are on the board.
[01:40:41.800 --> 01:40:45.200]   You'll probably have a special like gold plated thing that comes by the picture you
[01:40:45.200 --> 01:40:46.200]   up.
[01:40:46.200 --> 01:40:50.680]   I'm like the car it's in the car round James but except for you a robot.
[01:40:50.680 --> 01:40:53.240]   You're jumping in these boxes and off we got the way.
[01:40:53.240 --> 01:40:56.160]   The short the short term it's going to be like you know I'm driving from San Francisco
[01:40:56.160 --> 01:40:59.280]   to LA down I five and it's going to be like a really good cruise control.
[01:40:59.280 --> 01:41:00.280]   So nice.
[01:41:00.280 --> 01:41:01.280]   That's what it is.
[01:41:01.280 --> 01:41:03.640]   That's how that's the change the name is.
[01:41:03.640 --> 01:41:04.640]   Sleep.
[01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:07.200]   So it is inevitable it's one of those things that's taken I mean can you imagine a future
[01:41:07.200 --> 01:41:10.800]   you know even 50 years from now the cars aren't driving themselves no so is Ford thinking
[01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:12.560]   about how they're going to make money from this.
[01:41:12.560 --> 01:41:13.560]   Yes.
[01:41:13.560 --> 01:41:15.200]   Right because they know right.
[01:41:15.200 --> 01:41:17.200]   And they're and they're already slipstreaming.
[01:41:17.200 --> 01:41:21.040]   They got these consultants that are just talking telling them what they want to hear.
[01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:22.040]   Right.
[01:41:22.040 --> 01:41:25.040]   I do know I know they're probably working on it but I think they got all the confidence
[01:41:25.040 --> 01:41:27.240]   in the world that network cars are words.
[01:41:27.240 --> 01:41:29.000]   I mean I don't even know what that is.
[01:41:29.000 --> 01:41:31.600]   The cars talk to each other on the road you're driving along and that's hard.
[01:41:31.600 --> 01:41:32.800]   There's a rec up here.
[01:41:32.800 --> 01:41:33.800]   It's like ways automated.
[01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:38.440]   Well that's part of that's part of having this is you get a much more efficient traffic
[01:41:38.440 --> 01:41:40.800]   pattern if the cars can talk to each other.
[01:41:40.800 --> 01:41:44.680]   You know what the shift was when we talked about this 10 years ago it required a complete
[01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:47.320]   infrastructure redesign you had to have smart roads.
[01:41:47.320 --> 01:41:48.320]   Right.
[01:41:48.320 --> 01:41:49.320]   You need a wire down the road.
[01:41:49.320 --> 01:41:53.280]   It turns out with what Google's done with LiDAR and these smart technologies.
[01:41:53.280 --> 01:41:54.280]   And cameras and smart computers.
[01:41:54.280 --> 01:41:55.280]   Does it matter?
[01:41:55.280 --> 01:41:56.280]   You can be on any road.
[01:41:56.280 --> 01:41:58.080]   Bumpy road, nobody cares.
[01:41:58.080 --> 01:41:59.080]   Right.
[01:41:59.080 --> 01:42:00.080]   Yeah.
[01:42:00.080 --> 01:42:01.080]   It's going to happen.
[01:42:01.080 --> 01:42:02.080]   It's going to happen.
[01:42:02.080 --> 01:42:04.320]   Every time I use my cruise control and my Honda Civic and I realize that the guy in front
[01:42:04.320 --> 01:42:07.920]   of me just changes you know by two miles an hour and I get frustrated.
[01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:08.920]   Mm hmm.
[01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:12.440]   You know the BMWs today already they just they slow down and they speed up and it's
[01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:16.880]   and and they park themselves and it's yeah and five or ten years you'll have a full on
[01:42:16.880 --> 01:42:20.320]   what will they call it highway mode auto drive or something that you'll engage in.
[01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:21.320]   Smart cruise control.
[01:42:21.320 --> 01:42:24.880]   When you get to when you want to get off the freeway maybe you turn it back.
[01:42:24.880 --> 01:42:25.880]   You're doing it back.
[01:42:25.880 --> 01:42:26.880]   You have to do that.
[01:42:26.880 --> 01:42:28.600]   You just give it a location and take take you right there.
[01:42:28.600 --> 01:42:30.160]   I don't think you're going to have to.
[01:42:30.160 --> 01:42:31.160]   Eventually.
[01:42:31.160 --> 01:42:32.160]   Yeah.
[01:42:32.160 --> 01:42:33.160]   Just in time for me to lose my license.
[01:42:33.160 --> 01:42:34.160]   People will be perfect.
[01:42:34.160 --> 01:42:35.160]   You'll be an old retired guy.
[01:42:35.160 --> 01:42:37.120]   I can't drive anymore.
[01:42:37.120 --> 01:42:39.360]   No, I think I'm going to be doing a lot of years.
[01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:40.360]   I'm sure.
[01:42:40.360 --> 01:42:41.360]   I'd be taking the more.
[01:42:41.360 --> 01:42:44.160]   I can drive but who wants to.
[01:42:44.160 --> 01:42:45.160]   And I think there's a whole generation.
[01:42:45.160 --> 01:42:46.160]   Bring a car.
[01:42:46.160 --> 01:42:48.400]   Millennials that don't want to drive anyway.
[01:42:48.400 --> 01:42:49.400]   Who wants to drive.
[01:42:49.400 --> 01:42:50.400]   It's not fun.
[01:42:50.400 --> 01:42:51.400]   We're going to take a break.
[01:42:51.400 --> 01:42:52.400]   It is.
[01:42:52.400 --> 01:42:53.400]   You like to drive.
[01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:54.400]   It is fun.
[01:42:54.400 --> 01:42:56.800]   I do like to drive and I will miss having to drive and because it'll be more efficient
[01:42:56.800 --> 01:42:58.640]   to not have special parks.
[01:42:58.640 --> 01:42:59.640]   I know.
[01:42:59.640 --> 01:43:00.640]   You can go to and you could drive around.
[01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:01.640]   It'll be dumb.
[01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:02.640]   It'll be dumb.
[01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:05.560]   There's going to be these amazing movie car chases where there are all the robo cars on
[01:43:05.560 --> 01:43:09.200]   the freeway and then they'll be the old cars zipping around doing a car chase between all
[01:43:09.200 --> 01:43:10.200]   the robo cars.
[01:43:10.200 --> 01:43:11.200]   It's going to already happen.
[01:43:11.200 --> 01:43:12.200]   You will be able to drive like that.
[01:43:12.200 --> 01:43:13.200]   You're car will be safe.
[01:43:13.200 --> 01:43:15.200]   I think idiocracy has something like that.
[01:43:15.200 --> 01:43:18.920]   What was that Bruce Willis movie?
[01:43:18.920 --> 01:43:20.320]   Where every restaurant is a Taco Bell?
[01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:23.040]   He drives a flying car and that's a good one.
[01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:24.040]   That's another one.
[01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:25.040]   That's my dream.
[01:43:25.040 --> 01:43:26.040]   Minority roll.
[01:43:26.040 --> 01:43:27.040]   No, no, no.
[01:43:27.040 --> 01:43:28.040]   Fifth element.
[01:43:28.040 --> 01:43:29.040]   Or whatever.
[01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:30.040]   Real recall.
[01:43:30.040 --> 01:43:31.040]   Fifth element.
[01:43:31.040 --> 01:43:32.040]   He drives a flying car.
[01:43:32.040 --> 01:43:35.500]   And all the cars are in this kind of road and these are flying cars.
[01:43:35.500 --> 01:43:37.160]   That was science fiction.
[01:43:37.160 --> 01:43:38.600]   That's right.
[01:43:38.600 --> 01:43:44.440]   Speaking of science fiction, go to assist.com is the future for tech support.
[01:43:44.440 --> 01:43:49.000]   For 10 years, they've been the best remote access with the fastest speeds, the best tools
[01:43:49.000 --> 01:43:54.680]   for IT professionals, things like unattended support, eight sessions at once.
[01:43:54.680 --> 01:44:00.800]   Now they've got three new modules that really turn go to assist into the ultimate for support
[01:44:00.800 --> 01:44:01.800]   professionals.
[01:44:01.800 --> 01:44:05.560]   They've added a ticketing module that you keep track of, the service desk, let's keep
[01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:07.600]   track of issues.
[01:44:07.600 --> 01:44:11.600]   All of them change, release and configuration management is built into that.
[01:44:11.600 --> 01:44:14.680]   So that's great if you're installing new systems.
[01:44:14.680 --> 01:44:18.080]   They've got the monitoring which lets you monitor server health, performance, everything
[01:44:18.080 --> 01:44:22.480]   from how much hard drive space is left to how full the toner cartridges are.
[01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:24.240]   You can set up these dashboards.
[01:44:24.240 --> 01:44:29.640]   You get these alerts via instant message or text message or email when something's going
[01:44:29.640 --> 01:44:30.640]   wrong.
[01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:31.640]   You're a support hero.
[01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:35.280]   You're proactively fixing this stuff before anybody even knows about it.
[01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:38.840]   People say, "Golly, that guy, that gal, she's good."
[01:44:38.840 --> 01:44:40.120]   Nothing ever breaks around here.
[01:44:40.120 --> 01:44:41.880]   It's because you are using GoToAssist.
[01:44:41.880 --> 01:44:42.880]   I want you to try it free.
[01:44:42.880 --> 01:44:45.680]   You can do all three modules for the next 30 days.
[01:44:45.680 --> 01:44:50.760]   Free, it's cloud-based, support tools, not complicated, easy to use.
[01:44:50.760 --> 01:44:52.320]   You're going to love it.
[01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:55.160]   And all you have to do is use our offer code to try this free for 30 days.
[01:44:55.160 --> 01:44:56.800]   We do this with everybody, don't we?
[01:44:56.800 --> 01:44:58.600]   I love this idea.

[01:45:18.280 --> 01:45:20.680]   Sony's having a big event.
[01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:22.440]   The new PlayStation is here.
[01:45:22.440 --> 01:45:24.960]   The 20th, New York City, right?
[01:45:24.960 --> 01:45:27.960]   Yeah, I bought my first PS3 about a month ago.
[01:45:27.960 --> 01:45:28.960]   Big mistake.
[01:45:28.960 --> 01:45:29.960]   No, no.
[01:45:29.960 --> 01:45:30.960]   No.
[01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:31.960]   I'm holding off.
[01:45:31.960 --> 01:45:33.960]   Next box, but I know there's a new Xbox coming.
[01:45:33.960 --> 01:45:34.960]   I bought an Xbox too.
[01:45:34.960 --> 01:45:37.000]   By the consoles at the end of the life, the games are cheap.
[01:45:37.000 --> 01:45:39.600]   And unless you want to be on the cutting edge, which I don't care, it's fine.
[01:45:39.600 --> 01:45:41.080]   Well, this is the thing that is a little depressing.
[01:45:41.080 --> 01:45:44.200]   According to Engadget, it will not be improved hardware.
[01:45:44.200 --> 01:45:45.200]   What?
[01:45:45.200 --> 01:45:46.200]   Yeah.
[01:45:46.200 --> 01:45:48.800]   The main selling point will be new playing options.
[01:45:48.800 --> 01:45:49.800]   What is so basically?
[01:45:49.800 --> 01:45:50.800]   It's a PS3.
[01:45:50.800 --> 01:45:51.800]   It's a PS3.
[01:45:51.800 --> 01:45:52.800]   With a button.
[01:45:52.800 --> 01:45:53.800]   Playing options.
[01:45:53.800 --> 01:45:54.800]   See us through the button.
[01:45:54.800 --> 01:45:55.800]   Playing options.
[01:45:55.800 --> 01:45:56.800]   Playing options.
[01:45:56.800 --> 01:45:57.800]   Yeah.
[01:45:57.800 --> 01:45:58.800]   I think that meant paying options.
[01:45:58.800 --> 01:45:59.800]   Interesting.
[01:45:59.800 --> 01:46:04.840]   Well, there are some who say that console gaming is just kind of plateaued.
[01:46:04.840 --> 01:46:05.840]   It's over.
[01:46:05.840 --> 01:46:08.080]   PC gaming is due to make an emergence.
[01:46:08.080 --> 01:46:10.320]   And I think it's the Steam box and Steam.
[01:46:10.320 --> 01:46:11.320]   That may be true.
[01:46:11.320 --> 01:46:14.200]   That may be true.
[01:46:14.200 --> 01:46:15.200]   That's depressing.
[01:46:15.200 --> 01:46:16.560]   The PS4 doesn't have improved hardware specs.
[01:46:16.560 --> 01:46:17.800]   So it does have a cell processor.
[01:46:17.800 --> 01:46:19.040]   I mean, it's up very fast.
[01:46:19.040 --> 01:46:20.040]   Sure.
[01:46:20.040 --> 01:46:21.040]   Yeah.
[01:46:21.040 --> 01:46:22.040]   Piece of hardware.
[01:46:22.040 --> 01:46:23.040]   Great Blu-ray player too.
[01:46:23.040 --> 01:46:24.040]   Yeah.
[01:46:24.040 --> 01:46:25.040]   All right.
[01:46:25.040 --> 01:46:26.040]   So I just-- so buy one is what you're saying.
[01:46:26.040 --> 01:46:27.040]   Don't wait until the PS4.
[01:46:27.040 --> 01:46:28.040]   Actually, it's funny.
[01:46:28.040 --> 01:46:29.360]   The PS3 and shopping around for a used PS3.
[01:46:29.360 --> 01:46:30.600]   They've really kept their value.
[01:46:30.600 --> 01:46:32.040]   You can't get a cheap PS3.
[01:46:32.040 --> 01:46:34.000]   They're still like a couple hundred bucks even used.
[01:46:34.000 --> 01:46:35.400]   A month of game consoles.
[01:46:35.400 --> 01:46:38.480]   It's kind of amazing because that's like a one eight year old console and it's still--
[01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:39.480]   Yeah, guys are done.
[01:46:39.480 --> 01:46:40.480]   He can't get him cheap.
[01:46:40.480 --> 01:46:41.480]   He can't get him cheap.
[01:46:41.480 --> 01:46:42.480]   These things faster.
[01:46:42.480 --> 01:46:48.360]   Galaxy S4 coming out March-- or at least announced March 15th at Mobile World Congress
[01:46:48.360 --> 01:46:50.140]   on sale from early April.
[01:46:50.140 --> 01:46:51.140]   Yes.
[01:46:51.140 --> 01:46:52.140]   Sounds right.
[01:46:52.140 --> 01:46:53.380]   Rumors are five inch screen.
[01:46:53.380 --> 01:46:57.400]   Not quite a Galaxy S Note 2, but not-- but bigger than the Galaxy S3.
[01:46:57.400 --> 01:47:01.280]   There will be a Galaxy with-- for every 110th of an inch.
[01:47:01.280 --> 01:47:02.280]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:47:02.280 --> 01:47:03.280]   They're really size.
[01:47:03.280 --> 01:47:05.280]   This is their-- you know, Apple says we're going to make the one size.
[01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:06.280]   Three green millimeters.
[01:47:06.280 --> 01:47:07.280]   This is what any knock toy says.
[01:47:07.280 --> 01:47:08.600]   Apple makes the one size.
[01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:10.080]   You like it or forget it.
[01:47:10.080 --> 01:47:11.080]   Yeah.
[01:47:11.080 --> 01:47:12.080]   Sam's looks like, what do you want?
[01:47:12.080 --> 01:47:13.080]   What do you want?
[01:47:13.080 --> 01:47:14.080]   Any size.
[01:47:14.080 --> 01:47:15.080]   We'll make him.
[01:47:15.080 --> 01:47:16.080]   Like going to a tailor or a habronasher.
[01:47:16.080 --> 01:47:17.080]   It's just-- we got everything.
[01:47:17.080 --> 01:47:18.080]   It's a bespoke.
[01:47:18.080 --> 01:47:21.080]   The Galaxy-- I mean, we've gotten to the point where the Galaxy is the other kind of
[01:47:21.080 --> 01:47:22.480]   like relevant phone brand.
[01:47:22.480 --> 01:47:23.480]   There's iPhone and Galaxy.
[01:47:23.480 --> 01:47:24.720]   It's not Android.
[01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:25.720]   It's the Galaxy.
[01:47:25.720 --> 01:47:26.720]   It is--
[01:47:26.720 --> 01:47:29.320]   It's going to have an eight core process.
[01:47:29.320 --> 01:47:30.960]   Oh, yes, necessary.
[01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:31.960]   Yeah.
[01:47:31.960 --> 01:47:32.960]   Cool.
[01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:33.960]   The Exodus 5 Octa.
[01:47:33.960 --> 01:47:36.640]   We're going to do some cool stuff with that.
[01:47:36.640 --> 01:47:37.640]   Eight core GPP.
[01:47:37.640 --> 01:47:39.520]   Will it have a stylus?
[01:47:39.520 --> 01:47:40.520]   It will.
[01:47:40.520 --> 01:47:41.520]   Mine does.
[01:47:41.520 --> 01:47:42.520]   Sure it will.
[01:47:42.520 --> 01:47:43.520]   Does it?
[01:47:43.520 --> 01:47:44.520]   Mine does.
[01:47:44.520 --> 01:47:45.520]   Well, you have a note.
[01:47:45.520 --> 01:47:46.520]   The note has a--
[01:47:46.520 --> 01:47:47.520]   Sam's song seems to really be digging the stylus thing, so I don't know why they would.
[01:47:47.520 --> 01:47:48.520]   I think it's a selling point.
[01:47:48.520 --> 01:47:50.440]   You don't have to use it.
[01:47:50.440 --> 01:47:51.440]   You don't lose it.
[01:47:51.440 --> 01:47:52.440]   You know why?
[01:47:52.440 --> 01:47:53.440]   Because if you walk-- oh, wait, did this before.
[01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:56.520]   If you walk away-- go ahead, walk away with my stylus.
[01:47:56.520 --> 01:48:02.120]   No, I think if you walk away with a phone, it says, you've left your stylus behind.
[01:48:02.120 --> 01:48:03.440]   Well, now if you walked with--
[01:48:03.440 --> 01:48:05.280]   So what I'm going to do is I'm going to tie my keys to the stylus.
[01:48:05.280 --> 01:48:06.600]   What difference does it make?
[01:48:06.600 --> 01:48:07.600]   Which one disappears?
[01:48:07.600 --> 01:48:08.600]   No, no.
[01:48:08.600 --> 01:48:10.360]   Let me walk away with it.
[01:48:10.360 --> 01:48:11.360]   Hang on.
[01:48:11.360 --> 01:48:12.360]   OK, OK.
[01:48:12.360 --> 01:48:14.760]   There's a stylus beep if you leave your phone behind.
[01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:15.760]   Maybe it auto locks.
[01:48:15.760 --> 01:48:18.720]   Like if you walk away from your car with your car keys.
[01:48:18.720 --> 01:48:19.820]   Nothing's happening.
[01:48:19.820 --> 01:48:20.820]   Keep going, John.
[01:48:20.820 --> 01:48:21.820]   The door's that way.
[01:48:21.820 --> 01:48:22.820]   Go down the street.
[01:48:22.820 --> 01:48:24.820]   He's not coming back.
[01:48:24.820 --> 01:48:25.820]   He's not coming back.
[01:48:25.820 --> 01:48:26.820]   He's not coming back.
[01:48:26.820 --> 01:48:30.080]   You gave him the fake stylus, right, Leo?
[01:48:30.080 --> 01:48:31.080]   It's gone.
[01:48:31.080 --> 01:48:32.080]   Back a little further.
[01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:34.080]   Back a little further over the cliff.
[01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:35.080]   Back a little further.
[01:48:35.080 --> 01:48:36.080]   Yeah.
[01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:40.080]   Galaxy S4 will be available in Eastern Europe first.
[01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:41.520]   I don't know why that is.
[01:48:41.520 --> 01:48:42.520]   Fantastic feature.
[01:48:42.520 --> 01:48:43.520]   Yeah.
[01:48:43.520 --> 01:48:45.680]   Well, OK, so I never take it out anyway, so who cares?
[01:48:45.680 --> 01:48:47.600]   And if I lost it, I wouldn't be crying.
[01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:49.240]   Just trying to correct the--
[01:48:49.240 --> 01:48:50.600]   Well, it says it does it.
[01:48:50.600 --> 01:48:51.600]   Well, they lie.
[01:48:51.600 --> 01:48:53.700]   One megapixel rear facing camera.
[01:48:53.700 --> 01:48:54.700]   That's nice.
[01:48:54.700 --> 01:48:55.700]   Two gigs of RAM.
[01:48:55.700 --> 01:48:59.100]   These are all presumed specs.
[01:48:59.100 --> 01:49:03.060]   Two megapixel front facing camera, 720p.
[01:49:03.060 --> 01:49:04.060]   Jelly Bean.
[01:49:04.060 --> 01:49:06.300]   That'd be interesting.
[01:49:06.300 --> 01:49:09.300]   Looks like this is a fake Photoshop.
[01:49:09.300 --> 01:49:10.700]   But they put a lens flare in.
[01:49:10.700 --> 01:49:13.460]   JJ, it's just a very easy to do with Photoshop.
[01:49:13.460 --> 01:49:14.460]   It's a very--
[01:49:14.460 --> 01:49:15.460]   Make it happy.
[01:49:15.460 --> 01:49:16.460]   It's such a fake lens flare that I'm pretty sure--
[01:49:16.460 --> 01:49:17.460]   I hate that this is not even--
[01:49:17.460 --> 01:49:18.460]   It doesn't even look real.
[01:49:18.460 --> 01:49:20.700]   Actually, the planet Venus.
[01:49:20.700 --> 01:49:26.760]   But that's a rendering of the presumed S4.
[01:49:26.760 --> 01:49:29.920]   That shows you how successful Samsung is that Apple level
[01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:31.120]   rumors are now emerging about Samsung.
[01:49:31.120 --> 01:49:31.680]   Well, did you see?
[01:49:31.680 --> 01:49:33.000]   I mean, there were charts this week
[01:49:33.000 --> 01:49:36.600]   about the profit share in the mobile phone industry.
[01:49:36.600 --> 01:49:40.880]   And it's like Apple with 60% and Samsung with 40%.
[01:49:40.880 --> 01:49:42.880]   The two companies making money on phones.
[01:49:42.880 --> 01:49:44.520]   And those are the two big phones.
[01:49:44.520 --> 01:49:46.520]   The Galaxy has joined the iPhone in that list.
[01:49:46.520 --> 01:49:47.720]   And that's great for Samsung.
[01:49:47.720 --> 01:49:49.280]   Quarter million Twitter users hacked.
[01:49:49.280 --> 01:49:50.160]   I was one of them.
[01:49:50.160 --> 01:49:50.660]   Me too?
[01:49:50.660 --> 01:49:51.160]   Yeah.
[01:49:51.160 --> 01:49:52.860]   That's because we all were early adopters apparently.
[01:49:52.860 --> 01:49:53.360]   It was the first one.
[01:49:53.360 --> 01:49:54.360]   That was a very early adopter.
[01:49:54.360 --> 01:49:54.860]   I was not halfway.
[01:49:54.860 --> 01:49:56.460]   Macworld and--
[01:49:56.460 --> 01:49:56.960]   Yeah?
[01:49:56.960 --> 01:49:59.040]   OK, so that was the day I planned to.
[01:49:59.040 --> 01:50:01.360]   Curry was hacked, and he came in after--
[01:50:01.360 --> 01:50:02.280]   long after me.
[01:50:02.280 --> 01:50:04.480]   I had a good password, but I still have to change it.
[01:50:04.480 --> 01:50:05.000]   I changed one.
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:05.500]   Yep.
[01:50:05.500 --> 01:50:06.000]   Yeah, me too.
[01:50:06.000 --> 01:50:09.080]   I actually used that as an occasion to deauthorize everybody.
[01:50:09.080 --> 01:50:12.120]   Yeah, I just discovered I had over hundreds of apps.
[01:50:12.120 --> 01:50:14.720]   Yeah, crazy.
[01:50:14.720 --> 01:50:17.120]   Is there-- people do this thing where you change your password.
[01:50:17.120 --> 01:50:19.040]   Like whenever you change the clock, change your password.
[01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:22.920]   It's got to have something to do with that, because I have no zero.
[01:50:22.920 --> 01:50:25.680]   I don't use any-- I use the web for Twitter.
[01:50:25.680 --> 01:50:26.360]   I don't think it does.
[01:50:26.360 --> 01:50:27.680]   When did you join Twitter?
[01:50:27.680 --> 01:50:29.320]   I joined not--
[01:50:29.320 --> 01:50:29.760]   I could find Twitter.
[01:50:29.760 --> 01:50:31.200]   --by Twitter birthday.
[01:50:31.200 --> 01:50:32.320]   Oh, yeah, you could probably--
[01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:32.920]   Yeah, what is it?
[01:50:32.920 --> 01:50:34.720]   The real-- yeah, you joined it after me.
[01:50:34.720 --> 01:50:35.520]   You poo-pooted it.
[01:50:35.520 --> 01:50:36.440]   No.
[01:50:36.440 --> 01:50:38.400]   You did not-- oh, no, that was podcasting.
[01:50:38.400 --> 01:50:42.920]   Sometimes I confuse.
[01:50:42.920 --> 01:50:44.040]   So let's see what your Twitter birthday--
[01:50:44.040 --> 01:50:45.880]   It was blogging, if you want to be--
[01:50:45.880 --> 01:50:46.640]   Was it blogging?
[01:50:46.640 --> 01:50:47.140]   OK.
[01:50:47.140 --> 01:50:48.480]   Remember, John.
[01:50:48.480 --> 01:50:49.420]   The VORAC.
[01:50:49.420 --> 01:50:52.240]   Let's see what your Twitter birthday is.
[01:50:52.240 --> 01:50:53.880]   April 7, 2008.
[01:50:53.880 --> 01:50:56.520]   John, you were very late to the game.
[01:50:56.520 --> 01:50:57.360]   Jason Schrupp was your birthday.
[01:50:57.360 --> 01:50:58.840]   When is your birthday?
[01:50:58.840 --> 01:51:00.280]   Yeah, oh, everybody was before him.
[01:51:00.280 --> 01:51:01.640]   Mine's 2007.
[01:51:01.640 --> 01:51:02.360]   OK, well, maybe it's--
[01:51:02.360 --> 01:51:03.080]   A year before him.
[01:51:03.080 --> 01:51:04.400]   Ooh, a whole year you beat me.
[01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:06.400]   Well, I'm just saying, if you want to be in the first--
[01:51:06.400 --> 01:51:08.760]   if you want to be hacked, you got to get in there early.
[01:51:08.760 --> 01:51:09.400]   9th April 2007.
[01:51:09.400 --> 01:51:10.400]   I don't think that was because I think you'll
[01:51:10.400 --> 01:51:13.000]   look at "Battam Curry" and see where he came in.
[01:51:13.000 --> 01:51:15.040]   Actually, that's my second account.
[01:51:15.040 --> 01:51:16.600]   I joined December 2006.
[01:51:16.600 --> 01:51:17.860]   So then you quit because you hit it.
[01:51:17.860 --> 01:51:18.540]   Oh, yeah, you hit.
[01:51:18.540 --> 01:51:19.040]   Right.
[01:51:19.040 --> 01:51:20.740]   I quit because I was pissed off.
[01:51:20.740 --> 01:51:22.820]   Well, that's funny because I'm pretty sure I
[01:51:22.820 --> 01:51:25.020]   was a member before you quit.
[01:51:25.020 --> 01:51:27.700]   So you sort of Instagrammed it before--
[01:51:27.700 --> 01:51:28.180]   I did.
[01:51:28.180 --> 01:51:28.660]   We knew what that was.
[01:51:28.660 --> 01:51:29.620]   I was mad.
[01:51:29.620 --> 01:51:32.260]   Adam Curry was born on the March 24, 2007.
[01:51:32.260 --> 01:51:34.420]   So he should have been hacked.
[01:51:34.420 --> 01:51:37.900]   It was the-- everybody before May of 2007 got hacked.
[01:51:37.900 --> 01:51:39.980]   By the way, we weren't hacked.
[01:51:39.980 --> 01:51:41.460]   They didn't get into our accounts.
[01:51:41.460 --> 01:51:43.380]   They were salted and cryptid passwords.
[01:51:43.380 --> 01:51:44.740]   They weren't easily broken.
[01:51:44.740 --> 01:51:47.040]   It's a password file, which means that they can run some
[01:51:47.040 --> 01:51:48.760]   pretty serious hardware against it and maybe get the
[01:51:48.760 --> 01:51:49.120]   passwords out.
[01:51:49.120 --> 01:51:49.580]   Maybe.
[01:51:49.580 --> 01:51:50.480]   But it was salted.
[01:51:50.480 --> 01:51:52.440]   But if you do have--
[01:51:52.440 --> 01:51:54.240]   if you use that password somewhere else, you should
[01:51:54.240 --> 01:51:55.400]   share it everywhere else, too.
[01:51:55.400 --> 01:51:58.360]   And you should ideally get a password manager that saves
[01:51:58.360 --> 01:52:00.520]   your passwords for you and do some just auto-generated
[01:52:00.520 --> 01:52:01.040]   passwords.
[01:52:01.040 --> 01:52:02.840]   And so that's why it wasn't where you were.
[01:52:02.840 --> 01:52:03.800]   It was the only--
[01:52:03.800 --> 01:52:06.760]   But I've been saying, I live--
[01:52:06.760 --> 01:52:10.840]   So I use a password manager, and I auto-generate long
[01:52:10.840 --> 01:52:11.840]   crappy passwords.
[01:52:11.840 --> 01:52:13.440]   Which, by the way, if you have to enter that password
[01:52:13.440 --> 01:52:15.620]   mobile app, what I'm paying them in.
[01:52:15.620 --> 01:52:19.380]   Anyway, but I'm terrified that somebody's going to hack
[01:52:19.380 --> 01:52:21.580]   the password manager, in which case my life is over.
[01:52:21.580 --> 01:52:22.140]   Everything.
[01:52:22.140 --> 01:52:22.780]   Yeah.
[01:52:22.780 --> 01:52:24.260]   If they got my last pass, I'm dead.
[01:52:24.260 --> 01:52:25.420]   Yeah.
[01:52:25.420 --> 01:52:28.780]   And all your eggs in one basket, pretty much.
[01:52:28.780 --> 01:52:31.700]   Yeah, you got to trust that vendor, and hopefully they
[01:52:31.700 --> 01:52:34.020]   are pretty clear about how they encrypt--
[01:52:34.020 --> 01:52:35.020]   I think they're actually very good.
[01:52:35.020 --> 01:52:36.020]   Last pass is very good.
[01:52:36.020 --> 01:52:38.540]   Yeah, one password does a great job, too, and they've been
[01:52:38.540 --> 01:52:39.260]   pretty clear about it.
[01:52:39.260 --> 01:52:41.420]   But yeah, that's the jig is up if they get that one.
[01:52:41.420 --> 01:52:42.800]   Although, as many--
[01:52:42.800 --> 01:52:43.880]   That means it's got to be the world--
[01:52:43.880 --> 01:52:46.680]   those things have to be the largest targets right now.
[01:52:46.680 --> 01:52:47.480]   Pass for manager.
[01:52:47.480 --> 01:52:48.480]   Pass for manager.
[01:52:48.480 --> 01:52:50.320]   Actually, I would go for something easier.
[01:52:50.320 --> 01:52:51.120]   I don't know.
[01:52:51.120 --> 01:52:52.920]   I think the people who use password one
[01:52:52.920 --> 01:52:54.920]   as their password are the biggest targets right now.
[01:52:54.920 --> 01:52:55.800]   That's for monkey.
[01:52:55.800 --> 01:52:56.920]   That's for monkey is my favorite password.
[01:52:56.920 --> 01:52:58.160]   ABCD-EFG.
[01:52:58.160 --> 01:53:01.520]   Twitter, it was mentioned in 50% of all Super Bowl commercials.
[01:53:01.520 --> 01:53:03.600]   Facebook only ate Google+,--
[01:53:03.600 --> 01:53:06.440]   Technically, that's Twitter or hashtags.
[01:53:06.440 --> 01:53:06.960]   Hashtags.
[01:53:06.960 --> 01:53:08.600]   There are a lot of hashtags at the Super Bowl.
[01:53:08.600 --> 01:53:09.200]   Right.
[01:53:09.200 --> 01:53:11.360]   Everybody had a hashtag, right?
[01:53:11.360 --> 01:53:13.820]   Yeah, which means they could be on Instagram sucks.
[01:53:13.820 --> 01:53:16.180]   Hashtag fixed.
[01:53:16.180 --> 01:53:20.540]   How many of those hashtags are actually ever used?
[01:53:20.540 --> 01:53:21.460]   Somebody should--
[01:53:21.460 --> 01:53:22.460]   You know, do not.
[01:53:22.460 --> 01:53:23.100]   Yeah.
[01:53:23.100 --> 01:53:24.200]   Somebody maybe somebody--
[01:53:24.200 --> 01:53:27.220]   So the thing is, so I saw those numbers, too, Leo.
[01:53:27.220 --> 01:53:30.500]   And how many people watched the Super Bowl,
[01:53:30.500 --> 01:53:32.580]   like 175 million or something?
[01:53:32.580 --> 01:53:33.580]   Something like that, yeah.
[01:53:33.580 --> 01:53:34.460]   But that was one of the many.
[01:53:34.460 --> 01:53:36.580]   Some very, very large number.
[01:53:36.580 --> 01:53:41.180]   And they were all excited because 13,000 people--
[01:53:41.180 --> 01:53:41.680]   retweeted.
[01:53:41.680 --> 01:53:42.700]   Retweeted a hashtag.
[01:53:42.700 --> 01:53:47.100]   It's the same thing as--
[01:53:47.100 --> 01:53:49.500]   I'll have to get out Excel here to figure out what number is.
[01:53:49.500 --> 01:53:50.180]   I think you're right.
[01:53:50.180 --> 01:53:51.940]   It's a small percentage.
[01:53:51.940 --> 01:53:55.440]   But it's the same thing as customer service on Twitter.
[01:53:55.440 --> 01:53:57.980]   If you have a problem with any company, tweet about it,
[01:53:57.980 --> 01:53:59.380]   and you'll get special treatment.
[01:53:59.380 --> 01:53:59.780]   I mean, that is true.
[01:53:59.780 --> 01:54:02.340]   But it's a tiny minority of all customers.
[01:54:02.340 --> 01:54:03.740]   They don't know that.
[01:54:03.740 --> 01:54:04.620]   Well, they do know that.
[01:54:04.620 --> 01:54:05.940]   But for some reason, they've decided
[01:54:05.940 --> 01:54:08.380]   that Twitter is like, you can't let somebody--
[01:54:08.380 --> 01:54:11.380]   you can't let a nasty comment go buy on Twitter,
[01:54:11.380 --> 01:54:13.300]   or you're going to have something bad will happen.
[01:54:13.300 --> 01:54:15.300]   Yeah, I find that amusing.
[01:54:15.300 --> 01:54:18.860]   200 million active users on Twitter now.
[01:54:18.860 --> 01:54:22.180]   That's a lot, but it's not Facebook number.
[01:54:22.180 --> 01:54:23.100]   I think it's a--
[01:54:23.100 --> 01:54:23.620]   Well, well--
[01:54:23.620 --> 01:54:24.260]   It's a fad.
[01:54:24.260 --> 01:54:24.820]   I think it's over.
[01:54:24.820 --> 01:54:25.260]   It's a fad.
[01:54:25.260 --> 01:54:25.760]   It's over.
[01:54:25.760 --> 01:54:26.980]   I think it's over.
[01:54:26.980 --> 01:54:28.940]   The next big thing in the Harlem Shake--
[01:54:28.940 --> 01:54:30.540]   you watch everyone.
[01:54:30.540 --> 01:54:32.820]   Everywhere.
[01:54:32.820 --> 01:54:35.900]   Every show is going to start breaking their tables, too.
[01:54:35.900 --> 01:54:37.700]   It's going to happen.
[01:54:37.700 --> 01:54:38.740]   It's going to help the Leo.
[01:54:38.740 --> 01:54:41.660]   That was so not worth it.
[01:54:41.660 --> 01:54:45.540]   I cannot tell you how so not worth it.
[01:54:45.540 --> 01:54:46.860]   I think we should just stop.
[01:54:46.860 --> 01:54:47.940]   I think we're done.
[01:54:47.940 --> 01:54:48.580]   I'm just cooking.
[01:54:48.580 --> 01:54:50.300]   Let's talk about old money again.
[01:54:50.300 --> 01:54:52.020]   Bitcoin's.
[01:54:52.020 --> 01:54:52.620]   Hang on.
[01:54:52.620 --> 01:54:53.420]   Amazon Cash.
[01:54:53.420 --> 01:54:53.980]   Hang on.
[01:54:53.980 --> 01:54:53.980]   Come on.
[01:54:53.980 --> 01:54:54.980]   Come on.
[01:54:54.980 --> 01:54:54.980]   Come on.
[01:54:54.980 --> 01:54:55.480]   Cash.
[01:54:55.480 --> 01:54:56.420]   You can use it to pay for yourself--
[01:54:56.420 --> 01:54:57.020]   They're driving cars.
[01:54:57.020 --> 01:54:58.620]   The Sturpus Pro back in the box.
[01:54:58.620 --> 01:54:59.120]   Yes.
[01:54:59.120 --> 01:55:00.540]   I think we're done.
[01:55:00.540 --> 01:55:01.380]   That's how much you like it.
[01:55:01.380 --> 01:55:03.100]   He's got to ship that thing off.
[01:55:03.100 --> 01:55:06.340]   So are you going to buy one?
[01:55:06.340 --> 01:55:07.420]   Yeah, probably.
[01:55:07.420 --> 01:55:09.580]   And the other thing about it--
[01:55:09.580 --> 01:55:12.940]   I was thinking about this for the last--
[01:55:12.940 --> 01:55:15.300]   what has been six, seven hours now we've been doing this.
[01:55:15.300 --> 01:55:16.780]   It feels like it.
[01:55:16.780 --> 01:55:18.980]   But I was thinking about it.
[01:55:18.980 --> 01:55:23.300]   There's this vapor mag.
[01:55:23.300 --> 01:55:24.220]   Oh, yes.
[01:55:24.220 --> 01:55:28.100]   The vapor deposition magnesium body.
[01:55:28.100 --> 01:55:29.900]   Well, but the point is--
[01:55:29.900 --> 01:55:32.380]   and talking about all that--
[01:55:32.380 --> 01:55:34.500]   this is not a mass-produced item.
[01:55:34.500 --> 01:55:36.500]   This is not off the shelf.
[01:55:36.500 --> 01:55:38.100]   Apparently not.
[01:55:38.100 --> 01:55:40.500]   Apparently it's handmade.
[01:55:40.500 --> 01:55:42.820]   It actually is handmade.
[01:55:42.820 --> 01:55:44.420]   So that's actually one of the things
[01:55:44.420 --> 01:55:45.740]   that's kind of interesting about it.
[01:55:45.740 --> 01:55:50.180]   And as I was boxing it up to send it back,
[01:55:50.180 --> 01:55:52.900]   it gave me an opportunity to think about it.
[01:55:52.900 --> 01:55:55.140]   And I'm done tight.
[01:55:55.140 --> 01:55:58.540]   By the way, I did miss the top story of the week.
[01:55:58.540 --> 01:56:03.780]   Brent Ratner is going to produce a half-hour animated
[01:56:03.780 --> 01:56:07.020]   television series based on Farmville.
[01:56:07.020 --> 01:56:09.460]   Ooh, that should be exciting.
[01:56:09.460 --> 01:56:12.700]   If you thought it was fun harvesting crops on your iPhone.
[01:56:12.700 --> 01:56:14.540]   We can all just die now.
[01:56:14.540 --> 01:56:18.020]   What will that be on?
[01:56:18.020 --> 01:56:22.060]   Wish me into a virtual cornfield, Leo.
[01:56:22.060 --> 01:56:23.780]   Well, don't-- you know, Brent Ratner
[01:56:23.780 --> 01:56:29.100]   has produced such great TV shows as Prison Break, Percolis,
[01:56:29.100 --> 01:56:31.900]   Rush Hour, and X-Men The Last Stand.
[01:56:31.900 --> 01:56:32.860]   So this is not--
[01:56:32.860 --> 01:56:34.340]   He ruined the X-Men The Last.
[01:56:34.340 --> 01:56:35.820]   Yes, he did, didn't he?
[01:56:35.820 --> 01:56:37.220]   So good luck, Farmville.
[01:56:37.220 --> 01:56:39.700]   He says Farmville is one of the most exciting brands out there
[01:56:39.700 --> 01:56:41.500]   today, and I can't wait to ruin it.
[01:56:41.500 --> 01:56:42.220]   Wait, check the date.
[01:56:42.220 --> 01:56:44.220]   I can't-- check the date line on that.
[01:56:44.220 --> 01:56:44.980]   Is this really old?
[01:56:44.980 --> 01:56:47.060]   Is it 2009?
[01:56:47.060 --> 01:56:48.260]   Oh, it just feels like it.
[01:56:48.260 --> 01:56:49.660]   February 7th.
[01:56:49.660 --> 01:56:51.220]   How do you say February?
[01:56:51.220 --> 01:56:52.660]   February--
[01:56:52.660 --> 01:56:53.220]   February-- February--
[01:56:53.220 --> 01:56:53.860]   February-- February.
[01:56:53.860 --> 01:56:54.860]   --february.
[01:56:54.860 --> 01:56:55.580]   It is February.
[01:56:55.580 --> 01:56:57.140]   We're just going to go bazinga.
[01:56:57.140 --> 01:57:02.700]   Thank you so much, Ed bot, for being here.
[01:57:02.700 --> 01:57:03.820]   Ed writes for ZeeDeeNet.
[01:57:03.820 --> 01:57:05.980]   Do you have a special van at the URL like Mary Jo?
[01:57:05.980 --> 01:57:07.820]   Is it like Edbot.com or something like that?
[01:57:07.820 --> 01:57:08.700]   It is indeed.
[01:57:08.700 --> 01:57:09.860]   Edbot.com.
[01:57:09.860 --> 01:57:14.260]   Go there and buy my books and read my blogs and talk to me
[01:57:14.260 --> 01:57:15.700]   and send me notes.
[01:57:15.700 --> 01:57:16.700]   There I am.
[01:57:16.700 --> 01:57:17.460]   There he is.
[01:57:17.460 --> 01:57:18.620]   There he is.
[01:57:18.620 --> 01:57:19.220]   Thank you.
[01:57:19.220 --> 01:57:19.940]   It's been a pleasure.
[01:57:19.940 --> 01:57:23.220]   And Jason, it's a pleasure to finally meet you.
[01:57:23.220 --> 01:57:23.940]   Yes.
[01:57:23.940 --> 01:57:24.540]   Yes, indeed.
[01:57:24.540 --> 01:57:26.020]   We'll have to do it in person sometime.
[01:57:26.020 --> 01:57:26.500]   Never met.
[01:57:26.500 --> 01:57:26.860]   Yeah.
[01:57:26.860 --> 01:57:29.060]   Well, there was a rule about sort of ZeeDeeNet windows
[01:57:29.060 --> 01:57:30.820]   and IDG Mac worlds.
[01:57:30.820 --> 01:57:31.820]   And it's like our chemis.
[01:57:31.820 --> 01:57:33.060]   It's funny, you say it's not.
[01:57:33.060 --> 01:57:34.540]   Because he was mumbling under his breath.
[01:57:34.540 --> 01:57:36.940]   I got to get rid of this guy.
[01:57:36.940 --> 01:57:39.580]   He must die.
[01:57:39.580 --> 01:57:41.420]   You know, Ed used to go on our old radio show
[01:57:41.420 --> 01:57:42.500]   to Vorac on computers.
[01:57:42.500 --> 01:57:43.660]   It was really--
[01:57:43.660 --> 01:57:45.140]   goes-- reminds me of the old days.
[01:57:45.140 --> 01:57:47.300]   John, me, Ed.
[01:57:47.300 --> 01:57:47.780]   Oh, we need some--
[01:57:47.780 --> 01:57:48.300]   Yeah.
[01:57:48.300 --> 01:57:50.780]   Yeah, we need some pystrommy sliders from Maxis.
[01:57:50.780 --> 01:57:51.460]   And we'd be set.
[01:57:51.460 --> 01:57:53.220]   We don't have any food in this place.
[01:57:53.220 --> 01:57:54.700]   Anyway, great to see you again.
[01:57:54.700 --> 01:57:55.140]   Thank you.
[01:57:55.140 --> 01:57:56.660]   We'll get you back soon, real soon.
[01:57:56.660 --> 01:57:57.420]   Thanks a lot, Leo.
[01:57:57.420 --> 01:58:00.980]   Jason Snell, he covers the world at IDG editorial director
[01:58:00.980 --> 01:58:03.580]   there for both PC world and Mac world magazines.
[01:58:03.580 --> 01:58:04.180]   Yep.
[01:58:04.180 --> 01:58:04.940]   Great to have you.
[01:58:04.940 --> 01:58:06.460]   How was Mac world this year?
[01:58:06.460 --> 01:58:07.260]   I didn't go this year.
[01:58:07.260 --> 01:58:08.220]   I had some family business.
[01:58:08.220 --> 01:58:10.060]   I missed it for the first time in 20 years.
[01:58:10.060 --> 01:58:11.500]   It was actually very sad.
[01:58:11.500 --> 01:58:12.060]   Really?
[01:58:12.060 --> 01:58:13.220]   Yeah.
[01:58:13.220 --> 01:58:14.140]   Yeah.
[01:58:14.140 --> 01:58:14.700]   I didn't go either.
[01:58:14.700 --> 01:58:15.620]   I wanted to be there.
[01:58:15.620 --> 01:58:17.100]   It was not my decision.
[01:58:17.100 --> 01:58:18.500]   I had some family emergency basically.
[01:58:18.500 --> 01:58:19.260]   You really couldn't.
[01:58:19.260 --> 01:58:20.140]   You really couldn't go.
[01:58:20.140 --> 01:58:21.860]   It wasn't an excuse for not going.
[01:58:21.860 --> 01:58:22.940]   No, no, absolutely not.
[01:58:22.940 --> 01:58:23.980]   I wish I could have been there.
[01:58:23.980 --> 01:58:25.220]   Because they're changing it.
[01:58:25.220 --> 01:58:28.940]   It's more like a Comic-Con kind of cultural event now,
[01:58:28.940 --> 01:58:29.940]   which I think is smart.
[01:58:29.940 --> 01:58:30.620]   That's the way you go.
[01:58:30.620 --> 01:58:31.500]   That's the way to do it.
[01:58:31.500 --> 01:58:32.740]   It wasn't horrible.
[01:58:32.740 --> 01:58:33.500]   It wasn't hard for music.
[01:58:33.500 --> 01:58:33.980]   There you go.
[01:58:33.980 --> 01:58:35.300]   Yeah, it was a ring endorsement.
[01:58:35.300 --> 01:58:37.980]   And I talked to some of the vendors who were there.
[01:58:37.980 --> 01:58:39.540]   And they were like, we're actually doing deals.
[01:58:39.540 --> 01:58:39.860]   Yeah.
[01:58:39.860 --> 01:58:40.700]   Yeah, that's good.
[01:58:40.700 --> 01:58:40.940]   Yeah.
[01:58:40.940 --> 01:58:43.380]   You just got to change the expectations
[01:58:43.380 --> 01:58:43.940]   and change the focus.
[01:58:43.940 --> 01:58:44.780]   It's not a Mac show.
[01:58:44.780 --> 01:58:45.420]   It's the other world.
[01:58:45.420 --> 01:58:45.940]   And they're telling me--
[01:58:45.940 --> 01:58:47.380]   And they're not talking about what's happening in the evening.
[01:58:47.380 --> 01:58:49.620]   They're going to do it over the weekend next year.
[01:58:49.620 --> 01:58:49.940]   I think it's--
[01:58:49.940 --> 01:58:49.940]   Good.
[01:58:49.940 --> 01:58:50.700]   I'll go for that.
[01:58:50.700 --> 01:58:51.860]   They're just going to do it as a fan show.
[01:58:51.860 --> 01:58:52.620]   Yeah.
[01:58:52.620 --> 01:58:53.020]   Yeah.
[01:58:53.020 --> 01:58:55.620]   Comic-Con for Mac users and iOS users.
[01:58:55.620 --> 01:58:56.420]   Yeah.
[01:58:56.420 --> 01:58:58.940]   You industry could use a Comic-Con for tech, I think.
[01:58:58.940 --> 01:59:00.460]   Actually, it's a great idea.
[01:59:00.460 --> 01:59:01.660]   What kind of cosplay will it be?
[01:59:01.660 --> 01:59:03.540]   I'm going to go as Michael Dell maybe.
[01:59:03.540 --> 01:59:06.260]   I'm going to be the Apple II motherboard.
[01:59:06.260 --> 01:59:07.820]   Or maybe the Dell dude.
[01:59:07.820 --> 01:59:08.620]   That would be better.
[01:59:08.620 --> 01:59:09.820]   You do a really good Dell dude impression.
[01:59:09.820 --> 01:59:10.980]   I pressure the Dell dude.
[01:59:10.980 --> 01:59:12.780]   He does the real guy better.
[01:59:12.780 --> 01:59:13.220]   I'm going to go--
[01:59:13.220 --> 01:59:15.220]   It's always 420 for Leo.
[01:59:15.220 --> 01:59:15.700]   It is.
[01:59:15.700 --> 01:59:17.420]   That's right.
[01:59:17.420 --> 01:59:19.020]   There was, by the way, there was a little--
[01:59:19.020 --> 01:59:20.380]   And we mentioned this a couple of weeks ago.
[01:59:20.380 --> 01:59:23.060]   In the Samsung ad, they're doing the unicorn game
[01:59:23.060 --> 01:59:23.940]   and all that.
[01:59:23.940 --> 01:59:26.540]   And they have the two people working in the company
[01:59:26.540 --> 01:59:27.820]   who still have blackberries.
[01:59:27.820 --> 01:59:31.460]   And there's the one woman who's, now I have my blackberry phone
[01:59:31.460 --> 01:59:33.100]   and I have a system.
[01:59:33.100 --> 01:59:37.020]   But it was very prominently 420 on the phone.
[01:59:37.020 --> 01:59:37.700]   Yeah.
[01:59:37.700 --> 01:59:38.340]   I saw that.
[01:59:38.340 --> 01:59:39.700]   I wonder why.
[01:59:39.700 --> 01:59:40.420]   There's a gag.
[01:59:40.420 --> 01:59:40.940]   There's a gag.
[01:59:40.940 --> 01:59:41.940]   There's some intern.
[01:59:41.940 --> 01:59:43.580]   It was an Easter egg.
[01:59:43.580 --> 01:59:44.740]   It was insane, yes.
[01:59:44.740 --> 01:59:44.940]   It was.
[01:59:44.940 --> 01:59:45.380]   It was.
[01:59:45.380 --> 01:59:47.300]   Probably what it was.
[01:59:47.300 --> 01:59:52.140]   Ever note is the new home of the great Ralph Needleman.
[01:59:52.140 --> 01:59:53.140]   It's good to see you again.
[01:59:53.140 --> 01:59:54.340]   It's good to be on the show.
[01:59:54.340 --> 01:59:55.380]   Where's the blog?
[01:59:55.380 --> 01:59:56.860]   It's called Opportunity Notes.
[01:59:56.860 --> 02:00:00.100]   And you can find it at opnotesoppnotes.com.
[02:00:00.100 --> 02:00:02.620]   If you're in the startup world, please read it.
[02:00:02.620 --> 02:00:03.420]   Awesome.
[02:00:03.420 --> 02:00:04.620]   Really appreciate you coming in.
[02:00:04.620 --> 02:00:04.620]   It's fun.
[02:00:04.620 --> 02:00:04.940]   Yeah.
[02:00:04.940 --> 02:00:05.980]   We'll get you back soon.
[02:00:05.980 --> 02:00:06.820]   Right on.
[02:00:06.820 --> 02:00:09.500]   And John C. Devorek, host of No Agenda,
[02:00:09.500 --> 02:00:12.660]   NoahGenashow.com, channel Devorek.
[02:00:12.660 --> 02:00:13.740]   Busy man about time.
[02:00:13.740 --> 02:00:14.660]   What'd you think?
[02:00:14.660 --> 02:00:19.100]   I did not know what an aficionado and expert on football.
[02:00:19.100 --> 02:00:20.260]   You won your column.
[02:00:20.260 --> 02:00:21.260]   If you notice, I didn't mean--
[02:00:21.260 --> 02:00:21.620]   You didn't mean--
[02:00:21.620 --> 02:00:23.620]   They were going to win, which is-- and by the way,
[02:00:23.620 --> 02:00:26.940]   how come they never actually ran this new modern offense?
[02:00:26.940 --> 02:00:27.900]   They did some pistol.
[02:00:27.900 --> 02:00:28.980]   They did some couple.
[02:00:28.980 --> 02:00:30.020]   Reads.
[02:00:30.020 --> 02:00:30.460]   You're right.
[02:00:30.460 --> 02:00:31.620]   They ended up getting back in there.
[02:00:31.620 --> 02:00:32.460]   It was very interesting.
[02:00:32.460 --> 02:00:35.460]   But having read your column, I understood the game so much more.
[02:00:35.460 --> 02:00:36.340]   So I thank you for that.
[02:00:36.340 --> 02:00:37.900]   It's a new domain.com.
[02:00:37.900 --> 02:00:39.180]   John is an expert on some of this.
[02:00:39.180 --> 02:00:40.700]   A new domain.net.
[02:00:40.700 --> 02:00:43.100]   Oh, no wonder when I got to NewMaidomaid.com,
[02:00:43.100 --> 02:00:43.940]   there was a naked woman.
[02:00:43.940 --> 02:00:45.780]   Let me go back.
[02:00:45.780 --> 02:00:46.700]   That's the old domain.
[02:00:46.700 --> 02:00:49.060]   That's the old domain.
[02:00:49.060 --> 02:00:51.420]   Oh, new domain.net.
[02:00:51.420 --> 02:00:53.020]   This site may be compromised.
[02:00:53.020 --> 02:00:54.020]   Well, I didn't--
[02:00:54.020 --> 02:00:55.620]   I didn't the Google search results,
[02:00:55.620 --> 02:00:57.580]   but then I got here and was OK.
[02:00:57.580 --> 02:01:00.700]   We've had that happen too.
[02:01:00.700 --> 02:01:02.180]   Just these bad guys.
[02:01:02.180 --> 02:01:06.300]   I did not mention-- and if you are at all interested in the UP
[02:01:06.300 --> 02:01:10.100]   and P hack, which is actually much worse than a lot of exploits
[02:01:10.100 --> 02:01:13.740]   that are out there, Steve Kipson did a good show about it
[02:01:13.740 --> 02:01:15.740]   on security now this week.
[02:01:15.740 --> 02:01:17.260]   And I highly recommend it.
[02:01:17.260 --> 02:01:19.260]   And if you want to test your router
[02:01:19.260 --> 02:01:23.180]   to see if it is vulnerable, the bottom line of this
[02:01:23.180 --> 02:01:27.100]   is several thousand router makes,
[02:01:27.100 --> 02:01:30.100]   hundreds of manufacturers have a significant flaw that
[02:01:30.100 --> 02:01:34.420]   was based on the Intel reference code for universal plug
[02:01:34.420 --> 02:01:35.100]   and play.
[02:01:35.100 --> 02:01:36.900]   The code is broken.
[02:01:36.900 --> 02:01:39.420]   People just put it into their software and their router.
[02:01:39.420 --> 02:01:42.740]   It allows universal plug and play from outside in.
[02:01:42.740 --> 02:01:44.220]   So the idea of universal plug and play
[02:01:44.220 --> 02:01:48.020]   is a Xbox or software in your network, inside your network,
[02:01:48.020 --> 02:01:50.180]   and configure the router automatically.
[02:01:50.180 --> 02:01:52.260]   Well, now your router can be configured automatically
[02:01:52.260 --> 02:01:53.740]   from anybody anywhere.
[02:01:53.740 --> 02:01:54.420]   Well, nice.
[02:01:54.420 --> 02:01:57.580]   Yeah, so if you go to grc.com/shieldsup,
[02:01:57.580 --> 02:02:00.900]   Steve is still doing the great shields up router tester.
[02:02:00.900 --> 02:02:04.140]   And he's added the capability of testing your router
[02:02:04.140 --> 02:02:05.780]   for this vulnerability.
[02:02:05.780 --> 02:02:09.420]   It would certainly be prudent to turn off universal plug
[02:02:09.420 --> 02:02:10.180]   and play anyway.
[02:02:10.180 --> 02:02:13.220]   It's a feature no one needs, really.
[02:02:13.220 --> 02:02:17.780]   And if you do-- and then test your router after you
[02:02:17.780 --> 02:02:20.940]   turn it off, and with any luck, you'll
[02:02:20.940 --> 02:02:24.060]   get the messages that says you're not responding to my pings.
[02:02:24.060 --> 02:02:25.780]   If it does respond-- and by the way,
[02:02:25.780 --> 02:02:30.500]   since he put this up last week, 1,363 users
[02:02:30.500 --> 02:02:33.020]   have had positive results, that means those people
[02:02:33.020 --> 02:02:35.740]   are really vulnerable to hacks from outside.
[02:02:35.740 --> 02:02:36.700]   I'll check it out.
[02:02:36.700 --> 02:02:38.340]   Yeah, it's worth running.
[02:02:38.340 --> 02:02:41.380]   grc.com/shieldsup, or listen to a security
[02:02:41.380 --> 02:02:42.300]   nap from last week.
[02:02:42.300 --> 02:02:43.900]   Thanks, everybody, for joining us.
[02:02:43.900 --> 02:02:45.940]   And we do Twitter every Sunday afternoon,
[02:02:45.940 --> 02:02:48.580]   3PM Pacific, 6PM Eastern time.
[02:02:48.580 --> 02:02:53.220]   That would be 2,300 or 2,400 UTC on twit.tv.
[02:02:53.220 --> 02:02:54.380]   I just had to go.
[02:02:54.380 --> 02:02:55.620]   You just hung up like that.
[02:02:55.620 --> 02:02:56.620]   Boom.
[02:02:56.620 --> 02:02:58.300]   So I've had it with you guys.
[02:02:58.300 --> 02:02:59.260]   Just right over there.
[02:02:59.260 --> 02:03:02.340]   I've done the lights have gone down.
[02:03:02.340 --> 02:03:04.220]   You can watch live, and we love it if you do.
[02:03:04.220 --> 02:03:06.260]   As you can see, I talk back to the chat room all the time.
[02:03:06.260 --> 02:03:08.180]   You sons of beaches.
[02:03:08.180 --> 02:03:10.620]   But sometimes you can't, and so you'd
[02:03:10.620 --> 02:03:12.100]   have to listen after the fact.
[02:03:12.100 --> 02:03:14.460]   We do make audio and video available after the fact
[02:03:14.460 --> 02:03:15.020]   by download.
[02:03:15.020 --> 02:03:18.460]   There has been a bug, which Apple knows about an iTunes.
[02:03:18.460 --> 02:03:19.220]   Did you know about this?
[02:03:19.220 --> 02:03:20.780]   It's not updating podcasts.
[02:03:20.780 --> 02:03:21.620]   I didn't know that.
[02:03:21.620 --> 02:03:22.060]   I knew about it.
[02:03:22.060 --> 02:03:23.940]   Well, we knew about it because we're having nothing to talk about.
[02:03:23.940 --> 02:03:24.020]   No agenda.
[02:03:24.020 --> 02:03:24.980]   Yeah, no agenda shows.
[02:03:24.980 --> 02:03:25.980]   We've contacted Apple.
[02:03:25.980 --> 02:03:26.460]   We have to go directly.
[02:03:26.460 --> 02:03:28.220]   You can still subscribe to a show.
[02:03:28.220 --> 02:03:30.420]   If you subscribe, you will get the latest shows.
[02:03:30.420 --> 02:03:33.420]   They're just not showing up if you do a search for a show on iTunes.
[02:03:33.420 --> 02:03:34.980]   That's an old annoying bug.
[02:03:34.980 --> 02:03:36.620]   It's really annoying.
[02:03:36.620 --> 02:03:38.580]   So we know about it.
[02:03:38.580 --> 02:03:39.380]   Apple knows about it.
[02:03:39.380 --> 02:03:40.820]   They say they're fixing it.
[02:03:40.820 --> 02:03:42.060]   Thank you, iTunes.
[02:03:42.060 --> 02:03:43.900]   It's only in the iTunes store.
[02:03:43.900 --> 02:03:46.260]   But if you subscribe to a show, you'll get the shows.
[02:03:46.260 --> 02:03:47.060]   And that's the main thing.
[02:03:47.060 --> 02:03:49.300]   Do subscribe to our show and you'll get it automatically.
[02:03:49.300 --> 02:03:49.780]   Thanks, everybody.
[02:03:49.780 --> 02:03:50.460]   We'll see you next time.
[02:03:50.460 --> 02:03:52.020]   Another tweet.
[02:03:52.020 --> 02:03:53.540]   This is amazing.
[02:03:53.540 --> 02:03:55.940]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:03:55.940 --> 02:03:56.940]   Do the tweet.
[02:03:56.940 --> 02:03:57.940]   Do the tweet.
[02:03:57.940 --> 02:03:58.940]   All right.
[02:03:58.940 --> 02:04:00.580]   Do the tweet, baby.
[02:04:00.580 --> 02:04:01.380]   Do the tweet.
[02:04:01.380 --> 02:04:03.020]   All right.
