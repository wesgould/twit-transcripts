[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:19.720]   and whatever else is on our mind with Roberto Baldwin who is here for our favorite auto
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:26.640]   tech journalist. It's great to see you, Roberto. And when I say here, he's here. I'm in studio.
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:30.880]   We're doing another. We did this once before. Nobody died. And so we're going to do it again
[00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:36.240]   and all in studio TWIT. Yeah. And if nobody dies this time, maybe we'll do it again. Not
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:39.560]   a robot. It's not on the Skype. Robots can't do this.
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:46.120]   So nice to see you at S T R N G W Y S on the Twitter and is that the name of your band
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:52.440]   American North American scum North American scum. It's on my it's a sticker on his laptop.
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:59.400]   That's branding. There we go. Look at that branding. I got a band. You should go see
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:03.400]   this. If you don't live in the Bay Area, I don't know what to tell you. And it's is
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:08.440]   it a cover banners? That's your. It is a cover band. We cover LCD sound system. We cover
[00:03:08.440 --> 00:03:15.440]   2000s punk and dance music. And we do a talking head show. Oh, I love the talking from stop
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:18.600]   making sense. We essentially play all those most of the songs. Oh, that's a great song.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:22.200]   And then a couple of songs. You were a giant suit. I do not wear the giant suits. I don't
[00:03:22.200 --> 00:03:26.360]   I don't I don't I don't I don't have to change. I don't I just want to go up there
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.480]   to do the music and then no costumes. Also with us, the technologizer from Fast Company
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.600]   Tech Editor, Harry McCracken. Good to see you in studio. Great to be here. Finally.
[00:03:36.600 --> 00:03:43.960]   Brought Marie in studio. Love it. Nice. And to round the panel off from all about Android
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:51.200]   and Gizmodo. Florence Aion also in studio. But sitting as far away from me as she can.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:57.200]   So that's fair. Well, she's further from me. I wanted my own spot. I don't know what to
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:03.160]   say. I'm sorry. Also with his ad photo once again. It's great to have Mike McDonald in
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:08.600]   here taking pictures. Will you post on Twitter as you as you have been? He has been. Oh,
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.840]   they're live as he shoots them. You mean you have it set up some sort of automatic thing?
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:16.280]   Yeah. You don't actually have to do anything. It just happens. That's how I knew you were
[00:04:16.280 --> 00:04:20.680]   here today because I saw you tweeting earlier today. I'm like, Mike's going to be here today.
[00:04:20.680 --> 00:04:25.120]   That's risky. If the I have to choose which one goes out. Oh, you do choose. Ah, okay.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.640]   Oh, yeah. So there's an those are the ones that goes and Prud also in studio and his
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:35.040]   Clemson gear representing talk about branding. It's a Clemson hat. A Clemson shirt. Are they
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:41.840]   cleansed socks? No, it's a Sunday. They don't know anything. I don't know what Clemson is.
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.800]   Yeah, it's a school, right? Tigers. It's a school. Okay. Why is it that? I don't know anything.
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.760]   I literally I know zero about sports. I'm sorry. I love it. I am. I have a new
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:56.240]   idiot when it comes to sports. I have a new game. I play when you look at somebody's Twitter
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:05:01.240]   account and then Twitter recommends who to follow. I think it's interesting. I think
[00:05:01.240 --> 00:05:06.680]   they tie it to so I'm I'm looking at Michael O'Donnell's at photo account. They say I should
[00:05:06.680 --> 00:05:13.480]   follow Nick's shaved ice paradise. Ooh, Kleiner Perkins and index ventures. So a shaved ice
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:18.800]   company and two venture capital companies. That makes sense. Yeah. Yeah. Maybe that's
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:25.000]   it. Look at that. And then you also do some sort of magic with the photo. Oh, flows handling
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.200]   some sort of electric. Can I save one, Mike? Oh, my God. That's nice. That's amazing. Yeah.
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:35.760]   That's amazing. You made me a magic girl. You're magic. The gathering. You got to get
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:42.400]   my arm. And brainy. Sorry. Hold on. Hold on. Do the thing. Do the thing. There you go.
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:50.320]   Over nine thousand. Top story El Salvador looks to be the world's first company to country
[00:05:50.320 --> 00:05:54.640]   to finish that sentence. Don't look at it. Finish that sentence. El Salvador world's
[00:05:54.640 --> 00:06:01.040]   first country to adopt Bitcoin Bitcoin. You know it as legal tender. It's legal tender.
[00:06:01.040 --> 00:06:09.640]   Yeah. I don't know for the laws. It's secret. It's what I don't maybe because I don't even
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:15.120]   know what is was it the El Salvadoran dollar? What do they I don't know what they use their
[00:06:15.120 --> 00:06:21.320]   president looks awfully young. Maybe he's a Bitcoin bro. Look at him. Yeah. Is this I bet
[00:06:21.320 --> 00:06:26.120]   if you find his Twitter account is either glowing. He's looking to introduce legislation.
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:31.840]   His name is Niaebo Kelly. He does, isn't he? He's in wants to introduce legislation that
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:37.160]   will make it the world's first sovereign nation to adopt Bitcoin as a legal tender alongside
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:42.960]   the US dollar. Yeah, they use the dollar. So it's a is that good or bad? That's bad.
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:49.520]   I think that's bad. It's bad. It's bad for the reason that it can be manipulated by a guy
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:54.680]   who runs a car company. Yeah. Anything any any legal tender that can be manipulated by
[00:06:54.680 --> 00:06:59.720]   a single person with a Twitter account probably don't want to base your economy on that. So
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:06.120]   that rules that dogecoin as well. Yes. Yes. You know, that's exactly if you were a market
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:11.120]   manipulator, if you were a pump and dump scam kind of guy, not the third richest man in
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:15.160]   the world. But but some guy was up and coming that that's exactly what you would want to
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:21.760]   be able to do is with a wave of a tweet, make a currency go up and down and up. And he did
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:27.200]   it with Tesla stock for a while. And now he's doing it with the dogecoin Bitcoin Bitcoin
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:30.720]   with Bitcoin first saying we're going to accept Bitcoin for payment and saying what if they'll
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:37.440]   solve it or makes Elon Musk mad? It could happen. There you go. El Salvador won't let
[00:07:37.440 --> 00:07:40.880]   him let me build my battery factory. Yeah, I can't put a battery factory there. And then
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:46.720]   he like just let me steamroll over. But is this El Salvador's fault or Twitter's fault? I think
[00:07:46.720 --> 00:07:51.360]   it's just I think it's just the nature of Bitcoin itself and the way the world has
[00:07:51.360 --> 00:07:55.200]   be what the world has become. So they're saying El Salvador is a largely cash economy
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:59.920]   where roughly 70% of people do not have bank accounts or credit cards. So we're noticing a lot
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:06.160]   of this like move to have a centralized currency where people aren't deep in the banks the way
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:10.800]   that we are here in the US. Yeah, it's actually a big problem for a large chunk of the world.
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:15.200]   There are so many places where people are basically unbanked and don't have any access to paying for
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:20.160]   stuff electronically. Doesn't seem like just standardizing on Bitcoin is going to solve any
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:23.520]   of that. Well, let's I can sort of see them trying to connect the dots. Yeah, yeah.
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:28.720]   To Bitcoin. And you would know this very bit historically that's yeah stablecoin maybe that's
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:33.600]   historically what happens with technologies companies that countries that miss the intermediate
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:38.800]   technologies you know we you know cell phones for example we went through every stage of cell
[00:08:38.800 --> 00:08:44.880]   phone technology but companies that didn't have in landlines jumped right to cell phones.
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:48.880]   And they'd also they skipped right past PCs in a lot of cases. Right to mobiles.
[00:08:48.880 --> 00:08:55.760]   In fact in Africa where they don't have a banking system and PASA which is an electronic payment
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:09:02.880]   system is actually the dominant form of payments. So it kind of makes sense that you were you're
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:10.000]   skipping the whole banking system. You're skipping hundreds of years of central banks and currencies
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.560]   and just going and go straight go straight to the Bitcoin. Is it a way of is it a precursor a kind
[00:09:16.560 --> 00:09:22.000]   of a prediction of the future of fiat currencies that there will be some sort of cryptocurrency
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.440]   going forward. There's some discussion of like an E dollar someday presumably a stable E dollar
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:30.160]   rather than something that's going to lose. E dollar. Yeah.
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:36.800]   That's value. Yeah. Well all of the chain based dollar. All of the national banks did get together
[00:09:36.800 --> 00:09:42.480]   most of them most of the big ones did to get together last year and say you know we we think
[00:09:42.480 --> 00:09:49.840]   stablecoin if we're a stable currency might be a reasonable way for for banks to go forward.
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:55.680]   And I think the US the Federal Reserve is looking at stablecoin as I remember.
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:01.680]   That doesn't seem crazy. Yes. It's not clearly crazy because no one can make it jump up and down.
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:07.360]   Yeah. It's the the insanity of Bitcoin, Dogecoin, etc.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:15.760]   Is that it's it's it's very easy to manipulate and I wouldn't want you know my country's
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:21.920]   GDP based on something that if someone tweeted something or you know everyone wants to buy a
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:28.000]   GameStop or whatever like these weird like sort of mini-pilations that happen in a you know it's
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.320]   almost a these little microeconomies you don't want that to go out to a macro economy where now
[00:10:32.320 --> 00:10:37.520]   you're you're sort of changing in the entire well and that's why everything that's why El Salvador
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:42.160]   was based on the US dollar. There's a stable currency. Yeah. Not related to their economy that's
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:47.680]   widely accepted worldwide. Now maybe Bitcoin would be the next thing. There is this is a paper from
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:57.120]   March of this year from the Federal Reserve about global stablecoins that what it would mean
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:04.560]   to have a global stablecoin that every country uses instead of the dollar perhaps or in addition
[00:11:04.560 --> 00:11:09.040]   to the dollar perhaps that's interesting. Is it a problem looking for an answer?
[00:11:09.040 --> 00:11:12.560]   Because if everything's based on the dollar how much of the dollar fluctuates?
[00:11:13.920 --> 00:11:20.000]   Well I could I could say why the Bitcoin bros like Bitcoin aside from the speculative value of it
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   is it's decentralized and it's roughly anonymous right so it's like cash in that respect.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:29.840]   I can we can have a transaction that the government can't snoop at
[00:11:29.840 --> 00:11:34.480]   and it's decentralized. There's no you know right now any transaction you have is
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:40.400]   is in a ledger in some institution whether it's a federal institution or a bank
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:47.520]   but it's in there so and you know to be honest you know I don't have any dollars in my bank
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:53.040]   account. I have bits in my bank account already it's already that way right and when I buy something
[00:11:53.040 --> 00:11:57.120]   nine times out of ten it's not because I have a dollar bill in my pocket but it's because I have
[00:11:57.120 --> 00:12:03.120]   a credit card or worse I'd use the Apple Watch that's just a bit transaction so we're really almost
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:09.040]   already using Bitcoin with the disadvantage with the disadvantage of it being centralized and
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:14.960]   monetable and maybe that's why governments wouldn't like Bitcoin because it'd be more anonymous with
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:20.080]   Bitcoin it's public but the account number isn't necessarily tied to your persona.
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:24.080]   You're right but you can still figure it out. Yeah it's not it's not that different like I
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:29.200]   explain Bitcoin cyber criminals love that coin for that reason. Yeah yeah all ransomware now is
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:34.480]   Bitcoin. I used to be remember you have to go down to 7-11 and buy my money cards and send them to
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:40.080]   the ransomware guy that when there was when ransomware was at that level. That's a deep cut Leo back in
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:45.840]   the day that's a deep cut but but that's why ransomware didn't take off the minute Bitcoin became
[00:12:45.840 --> 00:12:50.560]   easy and enough people knew how to use it that we could demand it. Anybody can ransomware.
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:56.320]   Ransomware went rampant but then people get caught because they don't really am. Yeah it's not fully
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:59.760]   yeah they don't get caught you well you saw what happened to the dark side.
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:06.720]   Was that the name of it? I hope this is the name of it. The guys who ransomed the pipeline,
[00:13:06.720 --> 00:13:13.840]   the colonial pipeline. Somebody we don't know who shut down their servers and took over their
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:21.280]   Bitcoin account. So maybe it was them I mean that's the the the the that's the that's the funny thing
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:24.960]   about Bitcoin is like oh well it's secure I'm like yeah it's secure like you're fire safe and
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:29.200]   your home is secure. It's not that some we can still go in and take the fire say yeah they just
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:33.680]   don't have the key to the side of the but we have all these things as opposed to like oh it's in a
[00:13:33.680 --> 00:13:37.360]   vault somewhere where people can't take the vault. You know why that sucks because most of the time
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:42.480]   people put their photos in the fire safe and then the fire safe gets taken and so the thief really
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:47.920]   just took all your photos. This is a related story I don't know if it's real or not you remember
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:52.400]   anonymous remember the hacker. Oh yeah of course. I just finished the queue non documentary by
[00:13:52.400 --> 00:13:57.280]   the way on HP. Isn't that good? It was really good. The coming storm and they do interview the
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:14:02.400]   guy who one of the founders of anonymous who's no longer anonymous who said oh yeah they're just
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:08.880]   taking our our playbook and and 100,000 percent. Yeah that's that's what we were doing with anonymous
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:13.600]   and now that's the queue and on whoever queue was must have known what kind of understood how we
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:18.640]   worked and was doing the same thing. Anyway I didn't know anonymous was still around but apparently
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:25.680]   somebody calling themselves anonymous has issued a threat to Elon Musk over crypto market trolling.
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:31.440]   There we go. Internet activists this is from the independent attack. Tech entrepreneur in the
[00:14:31.440 --> 00:14:40.880]   wake of his recent criticisms of Bitcoin. How dare you? Yes they said and look I they actually put out
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:48.160]   the main source. I think I was threatened to be clueless. They actually did the Mr. Robot video.
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:53.760]   Yeah the caption for that is hacking group anonymous issues threat to Elon Musk.mp4.
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:15:00.080]   Okay just a little tip you can leave the mp4 out. Yeah sorry. You don't have to do that.
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:03.120]   You can cast it too. You have a little casting button right here.
[00:15:03.120 --> 00:15:11.840]   They're really with it on the tech aren't they? I don't know it could be just some guy with a mask.
[00:15:11.840 --> 00:15:16.560]   I actually have that mask. Yeah I think once when anonymous was sort of big when they were
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:21.360]   going after Scientology and etc. that was when you're like oh man how are people doing this and now
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:26.400]   like yeah I can buy this. I was given this mask when I worked at the next wave. We all got free
[00:15:26.400 --> 00:15:32.560]   guy Fox masks and so it's yeah anyone can hop on and pretend to be anonymous or be anonymous
[00:15:32.560 --> 00:15:36.960]   since anonymous is sort of like this decentralized. But you have to have the filter to make your
[00:15:36.960 --> 00:15:40.160]   voice shout like oh yeah you do have to have the filter. Yeah did you have it hard to get? Well
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.200]   the person could just be standing there and the person off screen could be doing carver and
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:54.320]   doctor. This is something that really scared me and Harry as a journalist well you're
[00:15:54.320 --> 00:16:00.560]   all journalists I'm sorry. Yeah because I'll some people hey you guys as a journalist
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:11.120]   I would I think this is appalling USA Today as Gannett who owns it. Gannett sorry didn't mean
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:16.160]   it's Gannett not Gannett. I used to write for them so I thought I was Gannett. I thought I was Gannett
[00:16:16.160 --> 00:16:21.280]   too. Maybe I said it wrong. Maybe the whole time they're like oh man we got to talk to
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:25.120]   flow about this and then who's going to tell flow. You would come over and say something about
[00:16:25.120 --> 00:16:31.680]   Brenda and Dylan and they're like all right sorry. She worked there she's the only one to work there
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:35.280]   so I'm going to say it's Gannett but I always think Gannett. I haven't been around people in a while
[00:16:35.280 --> 00:16:44.240]   so I forgot how to name Doc. Apparently the FBI earlier this year issued a request I don't know if
[00:16:44.240 --> 00:16:54.000]   it was a you know how legal how quasi legal this was. It's a subpoena asking for the IP addresses
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:01.120]   and any mobile information mobile information about the phone used of anybody who read a USA Today
[00:17:01.120 --> 00:17:11.840]   article from February 2nd about a shooting of two FBI agents during a 35 minute window that same day.
[00:17:11.840 --> 00:17:18.080]   Yeah everybody like you me everybody. Everyone. All of your information and then of course then
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:22.160]   they have your IP address so then they can cross reference that with what everything else you did
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:27.840]   within that 35 minutes. So everybody who looked at this is now potentially a suspect. I'm sure they
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:33.360]   have a suspect who do you think did it but now we're all going to be thrown into this giant pile of
[00:17:33.360 --> 00:17:39.520]   like maybe there is it incriminating to read an article about a shooting. I certainly hope not.
[00:17:39.520 --> 00:17:44.080]   Well I might have read that I can't remember. Yeah now you're a person of interest. By the way the
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:50.800]   subpoena also asked USA Today not to disclose the existence of the subpoena indefinitely.
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:57.120]   They didn't look for names just IP addresses but you don't need the name if you've got the IP
[00:17:57.120 --> 00:18:04.000]   address you just asked the ISP. Yeah. The organization says it will fight the demand for materials as
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:10.960]   they should. Yeah. It's kind of this more and more we're seeing law enforcement do these kind of
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:20.800]   to me I call it a phishing expedition kind of wide net subpoenas looking to tie a crimp for instance
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:26.480]   if there's a robbery at a 7-11 everybody was in the vicinity of the 7-11 for the last for that hour.
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:31.680]   They're going to call them all in. It seems a little overreaching this is even worse because
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:37.760]   anybody read the article which could be anybody. Yeah. It's a compelling case for VPNs for sure.
[00:18:37.760 --> 00:18:44.480]   Yeah. And it's also it also like you know for Gannett Gannett whatever the USA Today what if you
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:49.200]   have a smaller site that can't afford the flight. What if you're afraid what if you're you know just
[00:18:49.200 --> 00:18:53.520]   a person who has you know three people on your staff and the FBI sends you subpoenaed. Or you're
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:57.120]   an independent journalist. Yeah you're independent. You know patreon and paste posting their
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:00.480]   night case and this thing like how I'm going to fight this I don't have legal representation.
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:04.880]   And you might say you can afford a lawyer. We want the FBI to catch the guy who shot these
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:09.200]   agents of course except they don't have to catch him because he killed himself immediately.
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:14.720]   So they know who did it and they still issue this. I'm not I'm not sure what maybe they're looking for
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:19.680]   accomplices. Yeah. Or like if they're from an organization or something more.
[00:19:20.880 --> 00:19:25.040]   And the organization just went to the like oh we're going to look for it on USA Today.
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:29.840]   That's and presumably that's what we're all going to do right. Presumably it's like thousands
[00:19:29.840 --> 00:19:35.600]   and thousands of people most likely. Yeah. Yeah. 35 minutes. Yeah. Anyway. It could be thousands.
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:40.320]   Good. Good on USA Today for fighting this. But I think really we need to really look at the
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:44.400]   fact that law enforcement this is the problem is we carry around these phones that are basically
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:50.720]   surveillance devices at all times and law enforcement increasingly thinks this is you know a great
[00:19:50.720 --> 00:19:57.120]   resource for we have no idea. But let's just see what we can find. Yeah. If we just issue a subpoena.
[00:19:57.120 --> 00:20:01.120]   I'm sure I'm glad USA Today is fighting it. But I'm sure others have been issued
[00:20:01.120 --> 00:20:09.280]   in the past and people haven't told us or haven't fought it. So it's just something to be aware of.
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:13.600]   No one has issued me a subpoena for any of my websites that three people visit.
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:18.800]   Well that's what you do you do. They call that a warrant canary if you put that on your site to say.
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:25.520]   As of this moment in time I've never been asked for any information by any federal law enforcement.
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:30.160]   Nothing. And then when it disappears. Then you know. We know. I didn't tell them.
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:33.280]   I just took that notice down. I was taking that anyway.
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:40.640]   Just this is kind of a hodgepodge. Let's see. I'm going to see if we can follow a thread.
[00:20:40.640 --> 00:20:45.120]   Prime day. You excited? Why did I look at flow? I guess I covered the smart home.
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:51.200]   Okay. Good. Thank you. June 21st and 22nd. It's back to its old time.
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:58.240]   Do you stay home for prime day? No. Gizmodo though. That's a big deal on prime day, right?
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:02.000]   There are a number of publications. I can't remember if Gizmodo is one of them.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:05.760]   I think a lot of them. It's like black. It's the new black Friday where you have to have
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:08.800]   a list of all the things and is this a good deal? Is this because you know.
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:12.480]   All the sites are making money off affiliate links.
[00:21:12.480 --> 00:21:16.800]   Right. So they all I worked at car and driver and that was one of the jobs one day. I said,
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:22.160]   yeah, I'll do that when they had a like they sent the prime day like super spread for car
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:25.680]   and driver for car and drive because there's a lot of car stuff. So if they're if you're selling
[00:21:25.680 --> 00:21:31.920]   motor oil, you would want to know. So that's why there was the top 10 things you'll find for
[00:21:31.920 --> 00:21:36.960]   your car today on prime day by Roberto Baldwin on car and driver. That's why. Maybe. Maybe well,
[00:21:36.960 --> 00:21:40.720]   when they did it last year, I don't even remember when because time doesn't make any sense anymore.
[00:21:40.720 --> 00:21:43.760]   But I remember like we get it because those affiliate links.
[00:21:43.760 --> 00:21:48.960]   Oh, that's that explains it. Yeah. Wirecutter basically they live for Black Friday because
[00:21:48.960 --> 00:21:52.480]   they just crank out a ton of stuff. But they're really good about it too.
[00:21:52.480 --> 00:21:55.760]   Wirecutters very much like that. That's not a deal. We're not going to tell you.
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:59.280]   Well, that's the thing. I think there is a there is value to be added because I don't know if
[00:21:59.280 --> 00:22:02.480]   everything on prime days a good deal. Yeah. Some of the stuff isn't like they'll.
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:08.800]   Yeah. Yeah. We have the inventory. That's our that's our vertical.
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:16.560]   The inventory. And it's like a review site. Yeah, they'll do they'll round up the deals and then
[00:22:16.560 --> 00:22:19.760]   they'll link back to like the reviews that people have done at the different, you know,
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:27.440]   at kids and I like the tagline. It's all consuming. I mean, all consuming all the time.
[00:22:27.440 --> 00:22:29.920]   We have the recommender, which is kind of in the same.
[00:22:29.920 --> 00:22:35.440]   The recommender. Yep. I know the recommender. So yeah. So I would guess. Yeah. Here it is.
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:40.480]   They already have it. Amazon Prime Day 2021 when it's happening and the best deals right now.
[00:22:40.480 --> 00:22:48.080]   Bam. Bam. affiliate links. Anybody? Probably a lot of them. Yes. That's a good way. But you know what?
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:54.160]   Now it's so I'm wondering where to see more of that because it's getting harder and harder to make
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:23:01.840]   money through advertising because of ad blockers and ad trackers. Google saying no to third party
[00:23:01.840 --> 00:23:07.760]   cookies. Yeah. I think we're seeing a lot an awful lot of it already. You got to find another
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:12.480]   way to monetize. You can't do it with an ad anymore. And the wire cutter I think shows that it can
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:16.400]   be done in a way where the content is really good and that's you don't feel like they're
[00:23:16.400 --> 00:23:20.240]   shoving stuff down your throat and hopes that you'll click it's still good information. They don't
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:23.680]   have their own by the New York Times. Yes, the other thing. They're also owned by the New York Times.
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:28.400]   They weren't though originally they were started by Brian Lam. Brian Lam. Yeah. Former Gizmodo
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:34.720]   founder who left and his idea was we're going to instead of giving you a review of 20 products,
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:38.480]   we're going to say what the one product in each category is the one to get. And they still sort
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:43.280]   of do that. It's a little too. You have to review 20 products to figure out what the best one is.
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:47.600]   Right. Fortunately. Look at this. Prime Day starts June 21st. Subscribe to our newsletter
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:53.360]   to get the best Friday deals on wire cutter proof picks. So you know Target and Walmart I think?
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:58.000]   I don't know if Target but I know Walmart is also going to be doing like its own prime day to rival
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:04.000]   what do they call it? Wall-E day? No, they did this last year. Wall-E day. It was something.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:08.640]   Walmart Prime Day. It wasn't Prime Day but it was something that you would know. Just like the
[00:24:08.640 --> 00:24:14.880]   Walmart Plus was the Amazon Prime thing right? Walmart Prime. Walmart's doing so much to try and
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:21.120]   be like Amazon is. And it is the same days. By the way it's no longer a Prime Day. It's Prime Days.
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:28.240]   And yes Walmart and Target have announced. Okay. Yeah. It's already. This is from two days ago.
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:33.200]   Sales events to compete with Amazon Prime Day. Walmart's is called deals for days.
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:41.440]   June 20th through 23rd deals for days. Targets is called deal days. Also catching.
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:46.000]   Yeah. We're really into a little direction. It's clearly catching because it's spreading like
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:52.320]   wildfire. June 20th through the 22nd. So they're going to do three days. It's the longest they've
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:58.800]   ever done. By Mona Toys that weekend. Got it. Oh see? That's funny. Someone should have had one
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:03.520]   called What's the Dealio? He goes, what's the dealio? He goes, what's the dealio? He goes,
[00:25:03.520 --> 00:25:07.600]   what's the dealio? He's the dealio. How do you buy it? Holy Woot.com will do that. What's the dealio?
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:12.720]   What's the dealio? It's owned by Amazon now. That's a yes. So they can't do it. Oh yeah. Yeah.
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:16.880]   I remember when Woot was how I would get like a good deal on something.
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:19.840]   Yeah, but it was something you didn't want or you sort of wanted.
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:26.000]   That's not exactly what you wanted. I remember when they were doing the Woot T-shirt.
[00:25:26.000 --> 00:25:30.640]   That's right. Like half of my Mac life like closing with Woot T-shirts. I'm like,
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:34.560]   I'd be at work right and I'll send a little boom. Amazon has essentially ruined Woot because
[00:25:34.560 --> 00:25:40.320]   now it's just an Amazon. Yeah. Which is the new Woot? What is it?
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:46.640]   Ah, Mac. M-E-H. Which is founded by the Woot people. Oh yeah, that's right.
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:50.560]   So Woot left the minute, man. Yes, which is the opposite of Woot.
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:58.160]   Yeah, man is more of the old Woot than Woot is. He says, it's only $24 buy it right now.
[00:25:58.160 --> 00:26:03.040]   And then if you want it, you press, oh, I get it. You either press the buy it button or the
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:08.160]   me button. What happens if you press me? You have to sign in with your email.
[00:26:08.160 --> 00:26:12.000]   So they want to keep track of your meh. That's how you get around the cookies.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.560]   What's the meh? At least when they started, they were quite open with the contempt they had for
[00:26:16.560 --> 00:26:21.360]   what Amazon had done to Woot. I like when people get a lot of money and then they go
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:25.760]   leave and they're like, you know, I just play socks. I'll take their billion dollars,
[00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:30.640]   but they're not going to do that money. Okay. The classic daily deal site.
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:36.800]   Yeah. Get old, Woot. I get it. I get it. We all want to be hackers again.
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:41.040]   I love this. Click the buy it button for a great deal on something you didn't even know you wanted.
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:46.960]   Yeah. Or the meh button for an even more satisfying shopping experience. Abstention.
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:54.000]   Abstention. I abstain. I'm walking out. Okay.
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:27:01.600]   Honey, you're not saying instead I got a headache. You just say meh. Meh. Meh. Meh.
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:06.800]   That'll work. What'd you get for? What'd you bring home for dinner, Roberto?
[00:27:06.800 --> 00:27:12.640]   Whatever. Popeyes and pancakes.
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:17.680]   We decided that by the way, before the show started, we found out that Roberto
[00:27:17.680 --> 00:27:22.880]   is required on his way home to pick up something to eat, which means that we've got to really
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:28.880]   wrap this up pretty quick here. Bye, everybody. We decided since the last time
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:32.560]   Roberto was here, we fed him pancakes that you should run over to iHop, get some pancakes,
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:37.200]   and then stop at Popeyes and get some fried chicken. That is a perfect combination. It is.
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:41.120]   Fried chicken and pancakes. It is. They might even, you could go classic and get waffles.
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:47.360]   Oh, yeah. Then you got the classic. Oh, stop it, Leo. It's not brunch time. It's Sunday night.
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:52.080]   We have to all have dinner tonight. Yeah, that can be dinner. I know. Nothing can stop you.
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:55.520]   I know. You could have breakfast for pancakes and Popeyes. But I had a vegan
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:28:02.000]   chicken sandwich before I came here. That's a contradiction in terms. I hate to tell you.
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:06.080]   What is a vegan chicken sandwich? They spell the word chicken in different ways.
[00:28:06.080 --> 00:28:11.680]   With it. It's like sandwiches has, you know, they have really good fake meat, which I really,
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:15.600]   really like their fake meat because it's really just right and ready for a good conversation at
[00:28:15.600 --> 00:28:19.840]   dinner the other day because we've got the Impossible Burger now and a variety of other
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:23.520]   which I get all the time at BK. It's actually pretty good.
[00:28:23.520 --> 00:28:30.080]   It's still textured soy protein mixed with flavorings and cooked in the same, you know,
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:36.480]   oils that they cooked all the meat in. Yeah. But it's decent. But how far off? Because I was
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:41.280]   talking, it's actually fun. I had some teenagers over, all high school graduating.
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:44.480]   It's happening. Michael graduated yesterday and so does friends. Congratulations.
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:50.960]   And we were talking about how soon before you have meat that's meat but made in a vat, not made in a
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:56.800]   cow. Is that imminent? They've been talking about it for a really long time. Like the lab grown
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:02.560]   meat. Yeah, lab grown meat. It's the difficulty back when I was a vegetarian was marbling because
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:06.480]   a lot of meat gets a lot of its flavor from the fat. So they were having difficulty sort of creating
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:10.880]   the marbling. Because basically what they're doing is they're taking the genetic material of the
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:16.400]   cow and putting it in a petri dish, a big one. So you grow and growing without killing the cow.
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:21.920]   But you can't grow the marbling because it's, yeah, maybe they have to, I don't know. I'm not a
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:29.200]   meat scientist. You just have a lot of whatever that so was. Yeah. So it was, that's maybe pretty
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:33.920]   dry, I think. Yeah, it was a big deal. I remember them talking about back when I was vegetarian,
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:39.600]   then I thought he'd be a marbling and then yeah, that's the easiest way to get marbling is get a cow.
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:44.160]   Get a cow. But if you don't, you know, but I think for the world's sake and for our sake,
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:48.560]   it's probably a good idea that we replace. Oh yeah, well we can find a way because it's
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:54.320]   meat is just especially in certain like the US culture and so many other cultures. Meat is the
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:30:01.200]   main portion of your meal. It shows your affluence. It shows your ability to, yeah, and so you bring,
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:06.400]   you know, caveman, bring home meat. Yeah, when I became a vegetarian, it was really difficult to
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:14.160]   sort of like build a meal. Yeah, you don't have a brain, my drain, my brain, which sort of drains
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:20.960]   out all the time. How, you know, that, that sort of meal ideal, which was like, no side dishes.
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:24.560]   And a starch, it's all side dishes. So now when you, when you have to make a bed,
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:27.920]   chairs all, and then I got really, and then for a little while I was really angry whenever I'd buy
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:31.920]   something at a restaurant and I'm like, oh, can you do without meat and they wouldn't give me a discount?
[00:30:31.920 --> 00:30:37.120]   I'm like, oh, that's not okay. Because if you're not eating the meat, they should turn you for it.
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:39.520]   That's the most expensive part. But they're like, I don't know, we don't care.
[00:30:39.520 --> 00:30:42.160]   Sometimes that's why you vegetarian. That's what you get. Yeah, damn hippie,
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:49.040]   pluralist, invecitarians. No meat. So are you a vegetarian? No. No, you just decided to eat that
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:53.040]   fake chicken. It's so good. It's yummy. I still eat a lot of fake food. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:30:53.040 --> 00:30:59.440]   I eat fake the corn nuggets. I love them. I get to like kid all the time. It's not, it's no worse
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:04.640]   than the pink goo. The pink goo is very weird. Yeah, can't be any worse. Like form chicken is very
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:09.120]   strange. It's like when I first started eating meat again, they could make that. It was really
[00:31:09.120 --> 00:31:13.040]   weird. They could make that with a DNA in a meat treatish. They could make that. Because everything
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:19.680]   tastes like chicken. Yeah. All right. I don't know how I got into that. Anyway, meats. I was just
[00:31:19.680 --> 00:31:23.840]   curious about you guys, especially the technologizer, because you know, that's technology you would
[00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:28.880]   know about. Because you write these great articles for FAST Company, where you like dive deep into
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:32.720]   stuff. Thank you. Although most of the stuff I write about ultimately has started about
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:40.000]   ones and zeros, not history, but at least ones and zeros and gadgets and so stuff like creating
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.680]   meat in the lab as we might write about it. It's a little bit outside of my own. Can you can you
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:48.720]   just ask for me? You got to get on the meat beat. We have something on the meat beat. There is a
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:52.080]   meat beat? Well, I have a colleague named Adele, who actually is a vegetarian, but she writes a lot
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:56.560]   about the future of food and a lot of what you're talking about. I think it's actually a hot topic.
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:32:01.200]   It is. That's why there needs to be a beat for it. I'm a little angry because all of,
[00:32:01.200 --> 00:32:04.560]   I mean, there's been fake meat around forever and everyone gets really excited about
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:08.160]   impossible foods and there were fake meats way before all this. Yeah, remember when
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:13.200]   Sergey Brannett was a big deal, the founder of Google, had a hamburger and took a bite of it and
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:18.320]   he said this was made in the lab and this is like a $6,000 hamburger. And of course, now it's...
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:23.040]   Oh boy. Yeah. But they have like, they need safe ways. You can literally all that. And
[00:32:23.040 --> 00:32:27.280]   they just, just because there's some sort of tech angle to it, that's how it got like bigger.
[00:32:27.280 --> 00:32:31.360]   But all the new fake meats like came out after I was a vegetarian. I'm just like,
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:38.800]   ah, I should have stayed a thing. I don't know. The golden era for vegetarians is now.
[00:32:38.800 --> 00:32:43.520]   Yeah. Yeah. I blew it. You could have... I had to say though, it's still expensive. I bought
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:49.760]   an impossible, a pad of impossible burgers, safe ways. I ate bucks. So still pricey. It is. How
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:55.040]   much is... You would think it'd be in the long run, it'd be less expensive to eliminate this.
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:33:03.040]   But it must be a very costly process of raising a cow and feeding it for years to make me...
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:06.880]   Censives. There's incentives. Yeah. And also, I keep thinking that...
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:10.320]   Subsidize. I keep thinking that fake meat will be like super healthy, which is not...
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:14.720]   It's not. It's the same. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Unless you don't marvel at that. It might be healthy.
[00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:18.000]   I wasn't any healthy when I was a vegetarian that I am now. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.560]   I was still eating. I was just making like, chili fries with fake stuff.
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:28.320]   I was still eating like a 12 year old when I was a vegetarian. Yeah, really, the problem is not
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:32.320]   meat, no meat. It's being a 12 year old. That's the problem. That's my problem. You know what? You
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:37.040]   only have one life to live. As far as I'm concerned, I'm going to eat all the garbage fries I want.
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:40.240]   Yeah. Because the last 20 years of your life, they're like, oh, you can live to 100. I'm like,
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:43.040]   yeah, but do I really want to get past 80? Yeah. Can I? And will I?
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:50.240]   Well, you're my age. You will want to live to 100. Trust me. Trust me. Your whole attitude will
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:53.520]   change on this. Well, right now, I'm not thinking about the future. I'm thinking about chili fries.
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:57.760]   Chili fries and Popeyes and pancakes. Popeyes and pancakes and chili fries.
[00:33:57.760 --> 00:34:02.160]   Our show today brought to you by podium. Actually, I got a podium the other day. Who was it?
[00:34:02.160 --> 00:34:06.800]   Oh, Lisa was saying, oh, look, who uses podium? I said, our dentist, I can't remember.
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:13.440]   podium is awesome. It is. It is. If you're a small business, if you want a way to engage your customers
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:20.320]   and airy, you know, because you follow the internet history in the early days of,
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:27.360]   of, you know, business in the maybe the 2000s, getting an email was a big deal. I got what he
[00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:32.560]   got an email address, you know, Mike spikes at AOL.com. That was a big deal. And then,
[00:34:33.120 --> 00:34:37.280]   actually, even before that, I was having a voicemail and then it was email and then was having a web
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:48.160]   page. Now it's having its text. It turns out texts are so much more effective than emails or
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:54.720]   newsletters or websites to reach out to customers. podium makes it possible. It's a messaging platform
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:35:00.880]   to power your business. One of the good things that, you know, a lot of bad things during quarantine.
[00:35:00.880 --> 00:35:06.240]   One of the good things come out this year is how much the on-demand economy is taken off.
[00:35:06.240 --> 00:35:11.200]   You can watch a movie, you know, instead of in the theater, you watch it at home. You can get curbside
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:16.720]   pickup from your favorite restaurant. You could check with your doctor over Zoom. Customers have
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:22.320]   been now conditioned to kind of a lower friction way of doing business, no matter what you're selling.
[00:35:22.320 --> 00:35:28.160]   That's why more than 90,000 local businesses of all sizes have turned to podium, PODIUM.
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:33.120]   Whether you have one location or a thousand podium can help you stay ahead. It means doing
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:39.440]   businesses as easy as sending a text. And because 98% of texts get opened,
[00:35:39.440 --> 00:35:44.320]   that means you get more business done. All your employees can text from a single inbox.
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:48.880]   That makes it a lot easier. Offers a much smoother experience for your customers.
[00:35:48.880 --> 00:35:52.640]   If you want to answer questions, send a text. If you want to collect reviews,
[00:35:52.640 --> 00:35:57.760]   send a text. You want to schedule an appointment or delivery, send a text. You can even collect
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:03.200]   payments by sending a text. Here's a couple of examples. Car dealerships,
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:09.600]   selling more cars by offering text messaging. A dealer sold a $50,000 truck and four messages
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:14.320]   back and forth. Dealerships are running profitable service centers with easier appointment scheduling.
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:18.560]   Ask yourself, if I have to call the dealer to make an appointment or I can text them,
[00:36:18.560 --> 00:36:22.720]   what you're going to do? You're going to text them. Home service providers responding faster,
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:27.040]   winning more jobs in their competition because the homeowner doesn't have to call. They don't
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:35.120]   have to leave a voicemail. You're out fixing roofs. They text you and you get back and touch faster.
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:39.280]   By the way, I think you probably know this in your business, if you're a home service provider,
[00:36:39.280 --> 00:36:44.880]   first to reply, first to get the job. If you're a service professional, a dentist,
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:48.880]   dentist in New York City had a million dollars in overdue collections. He sent everyone a text
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:55.200]   payment request, collected 70%, just two weeks, $700,000. That's a real success story.
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:37:00.160]   That's podium. Today's customer is demand on demand everything, even from local businesses.

[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:26.960]   Thank you for supporting this week in tech by using that address that way. They know you saw it here.
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:33.360]   I'm sure you've been talking about this on all about Android. Flow Huawei has launched its new
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:40.080]   operating system. It's not Android. It's not iOS. It's HarmonyOS.
[00:37:40.080 --> 00:37:46.000]   We haven't talked about it yet, just because as it tends to happen, all of the news happens
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:49.520]   the day after all about it. They plan it that way, so you won't. They just plan it that way for us.
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:55.760]   So I'm sure we'll have more to say come Tuesday. Can we buy Huawei in the US yet? No.
[00:37:55.760 --> 00:38:03.120]   You could, but not anymore. Yeah. Not openly and freely. Right. You got to go back back,
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:08.400]   Ali. Yeah, he has a Huawei cell phone. You're holding Huawei. I remember, you know, I liked
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:13.040]   the Huawei, the P20 and the P40. These were great phones, great, really good cameras. Even the mates
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:18.320]   were very good phones as well. And then the US government said, you know, we think they're,
[00:38:19.040 --> 00:38:22.480]   you know, they were founded by a former Chinese military officer. We think they're still in
[00:38:22.480 --> 00:38:27.040]   goods with the Chinese military. Okay. And it was mostly 1982 again. Yeah. Well, I think it was
[00:38:27.040 --> 00:38:32.400]   mostly about 5G. Like don't use Huawei as infrastructure network infrastructure. Okay, I understand that.
[00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:37.360]   But Huawei was so hurt by it. Remember they announced they had two phones. They were at,
[00:38:37.360 --> 00:38:42.400]   it was at CES and they were going to have a big announcement and they, the deal was they were
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:47.440]   going to be in Verizon stores. Verizon pulled out because of the US government.
[00:38:47.440 --> 00:38:52.080]   I think I remember. And they had a cancel announcement. And I talked to Huawei after that,
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:56.880]   their PR person was from Seattle. She said, there's no point in trying to sell a phone in the US if
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:39:01.280]   you can't get in the carrier stores. He just looked at Google with a Pixel phone. You just,
[00:39:01.280 --> 00:39:06.720]   you just, that's how people buy phones in America. So they pulled out. So we will probably not get
[00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:15.200]   to see Harmony OS. I'm just curious how much they plan to put it on smartphones, on smartwatches,
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:19.840]   on TVs. It's going to be everywhere. And it's kind of interesting because
[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:24.480]   Tizen, which was Samsung's. I'm right here on the watch. Yeah. And I thought
[00:39:24.480 --> 00:39:28.320]   Tizen, you know, on the, on the gears where it was worked very well, but it was limited because
[00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:33.920]   you couldn't install all the other apps that you could wear. I think Tizen's gone now, right?
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:38.320]   It will be as soon as they do the, I mean, we don't know what that changeover is going to look like
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:42.800]   because there's three generations of watches now to consider for people who still have Tizen.
[00:39:42.800 --> 00:39:48.480]   I bought into the Samsung ecosystem right here. So I've paid money for apps that exist on this watch.
[00:39:48.480 --> 00:39:53.040]   But you, those will probably, I don't know, but they're not going to transfer when I go
[00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:58.720]   if and when I go back to where. And so that was one question that Google really wasn't clear about.
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:06.640]   It is where OS is. No. So my colleague Victoria Song, she actually reached out to Google after
[00:40:06.640 --> 00:40:13.040]   Google I/O. And my understanding was that it's, you can still call it Wear OS, but it's going to
[00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:20.720]   gradually just be referred to as Wear. But it's not Tizen. No, it's not Tizen. There's no Tizen DNA
[00:40:20.720 --> 00:40:24.320]   in your Wear OS. I don't know. It's not like peanut butter chocolate. I don't know yet.
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:28.400]   I don't think so because it's going to run the app store, right? The Google Play store.
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:32.080]   So that means that's fundamentally. You mean like the skeleton. Yeah, that's going to be
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:37.360]   the skeleton will not be Tizen OS. No, it's Android. It does, however,
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:44.480]   saying that Harmony might really be Android. I'm going to guess it is.
[00:40:44.480 --> 00:40:48.720]   I'm going to get a piece saying that I think he signed up for the developer kit.
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:56.400]   And apparently when you do that, you can see this is basically a very, maybe a very, very lightly
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:41:00.880]   reskinned Android. No matter, even though Huawei says, no, this is not Android.
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:08.080]   Ron's headline at Ars Technica is fake it till you make it meets OS development. There is no
[00:41:08.080 --> 00:41:13.520]   discernible difference between Huawei's all new OS in Android. And in order to register to be a
[00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:20.720]   developer and get the development kit, you need to send them your passport and credit card information.
[00:41:20.720 --> 00:41:27.680]   Oh, no. Oh, no. I'm sure that's fine. I'm sorry. Is this a visa to use a smartwatch?
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:35.920]   Because that's like visa level identification needs there. That's yes. I have your credit card.
[00:41:35.920 --> 00:41:40.240]   And you have your pen number. Could you send that to your skin must be clear. All
[00:41:40.240 --> 00:41:44.800]   information must be led to your passport must be valid. Your passport must not be smudged or
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:51.280]   damaged in any way. You also have to send them a credit card and a bank statement.
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:42:00.000]   I don't think so. So did Ron actually do all that? I did a little nervous.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.960]   That's how he learned that it looked really, really, really like Android.
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:09.840]   And not even all that dramatically reskinned either, apparently.
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:16.400]   Womp, womp. I hate to say it, but that is kind of the MO of Chinese companies, isn't it?
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:23.200]   Because they don't have strict laws on protecting intellectual property, especially American
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:29.200]   intellectual property, there's no incentive to not just steal it. Well, I mean, as far as I can tell,
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:35.360]   and one of Huawei's big problems is not being able to put the Google Play Store on its devices.
[00:42:35.920 --> 00:42:40.480]   And if they fork Android, it might be a little bit easier to deal with that.
[00:42:40.480 --> 00:42:47.840]   Interesting. That was Google's decision not to do business in China. So they effectively,
[00:42:47.840 --> 00:42:51.680]   you know, Android's open source, you can use Android, but you don't get any of the Google apps,
[00:42:51.680 --> 00:42:56.400]   including the most important app, which is the Play Store, but it does require some subsidiary
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:43:03.920]   apps to install and run. That's interesting. Well, oh, well, I guess I won't hold out hope.
[00:43:05.120 --> 00:43:12.880]   No, there's no hope for that. There's no hope. Well, nobody, nobody's in a no way, and Huawei is
[00:43:12.880 --> 00:43:19.120]   not really a name that's known here as it is. And are you going to pay? You all have your
[00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:28.080]   Twitter handles. I do have a Twitter. You're going to pay $2.99 to Twitter. Twitter,
[00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:33.760]   what Twitter blue so I can explain better. The ability to retract tweets within a
[00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:38.320]   complain better. I can retract tweets. How about I just don't make that bad take public in the first
[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:44.400]   place? You can also just delete it. That's true. That's one way to retract. Yeah, it's essential.
[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:49.360]   All the things they have on there, it feels like the best thing is like, oh, you can complain
[00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:54.560]   better. Well, listen to you when you complain. Twitter blue is designed for power users
[00:43:54.560 --> 00:44:00.320]   who are willing to pay a monthly fee for exclusive features. You can't get in the US yet.
[00:44:00.320 --> 00:44:07.840]   Canada on Australia first, 349 in Canada, 449 in Australia. No word about when it'll be offered
[00:44:07.840 --> 00:44:13.280]   in the US, but I think it's probably we heard this rumor. It's very likely they're trying it out,
[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:20.160]   this is out of town tryouts. And if everything goes well in Canada and Australia, they'll launch
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:25.360]   in the US. There's a reader view that sounds at least vaguely intriguing. Yeah, let's you read
[00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:30.960]   the threads. That's the one thing that I thought to myself, if that's good, that would be worth
[00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:36.640]   a few bucks a month. We started Club Tuit seven bucks a month. So it's more expensive.
[00:44:36.640 --> 00:44:42.560]   Add free versions of the shows, the Discord server, the Twit Plus feed, stuff like that.
[00:44:42.560 --> 00:44:48.400]   The stuff we're adding as benefit is just because people want something for their money, but really
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:53.600]   the message of Club Tuit, and I think probably for Twitter blue is, but you want to support us,
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:58.960]   if you really use the service or you really like our shows, support us. So maybe Twitter is just
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:03.600]   saying, because they've always historically had trouble making money, but they've been making
[00:45:03.600 --> 00:45:08.320]   money with ad sales. I mean, the difference between you and them is that you create the content. So
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:12.640]   you're charging for the content on Twitter. I'm creating the content. Now, Twitter's charging
[00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:17.600]   for access to your content and charging you to make the content. Yeah. Yep.
[00:45:17.600 --> 00:45:22.000]   But I think I guess bookmark reader mode. I mean, that sounds kind of cool.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:26.880]   Mark folders so you can organize the tweets you save. Access color themes for the Twitter app.
[00:45:26.880 --> 00:45:33.280]   Well, by the way, if you have to use the now Twitter's official app,
[00:45:33.280 --> 00:45:35.920]   because our website to take advantage of Twitter. I don't.
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:41.440]   I think a lot of people duck duck go. Yeah, I like tweet deck, which is owned by Twitter,
[00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:47.680]   but I almost promise you is not. See, I would pay $2.99 for tweet deck, to be honest with you.
[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:51.360]   Just a nicer version of tweet deck. Yeah. Yeah. Put some money in a tweet deck.
[00:45:51.360 --> 00:45:55.280]   Now that is a power user situation. That's a utility you're paying for.
[00:45:55.280 --> 00:45:58.800]   Right. And that would be reasonable. I still like the card folders.
[00:45:58.800 --> 00:46:00.320]   Get a customer support.
[00:46:00.320 --> 00:46:04.640]   Dedic. It's like, if I pay that money, does that mean I get harass less online?
[00:46:04.640 --> 00:46:06.560]   Does that mean that I have to protect things? Well, you can complain.
[00:46:06.560 --> 00:46:10.400]   Like, oh, I can they'll listen to me. They'll listen as opposed to just sort of like
[00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:14.240]   waiting 24 hours and sending you a message and saying, "That's quick. Sorry, you were docked."
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:19.600]   So I think most people, normal people, don't even care a bit about Twitter. In fact, if it
[00:46:19.600 --> 00:46:22.880]   weren't for Donald Trump in the last four years. I'm asking me, maybe on Twitter, but
[00:46:22.880 --> 00:46:26.640]   wow. They don't hate me, but they're like, "Why are you still on Twitter? All you do is get
[00:46:26.640 --> 00:46:31.040]   upset about it." I'm like, "Don't you understand? This is my network." Someone on the Internet is wrong.
[00:46:31.040 --> 00:46:37.440]   That's to me. That's the problem with Twitter. It's just about being out, you know, it's an
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:42.320]   outrage generator. They're still not giving us editing of tweets, which I would have paid
[00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:47.520]   like $10 a month for probably. Just because you left out the apostrophe or... No, sometimes it's
[00:46:47.520 --> 00:46:52.080]   worse than that. And I usually just delete them, but sometimes people have responded to them already.
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:58.000]   So if it goes viral and then you realize five minutes later, you're like, "Oh darn."
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.920]   Or sometimes they have... Sometimes I respond to my own tweet and apologize for the typo.
[00:47:01.920 --> 00:47:06.320]   Yeah, yeah, yeah. I sort of just like giving up. I'm like, "Whatever, man."
[00:47:06.320 --> 00:47:09.920]   But this is the thing. So I was saying most people don't care about Twitter, but there is a
[00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:15.840]   Twitter ruddy in which is mostly tech journalists. We love it. We love our bubble.
[00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:20.960]   I don't like it at all. And I think the easiest way for me not to tweet something I'm regretting
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:25.680]   is not to tweet it, not to tweet at all. I asked my husband, "Is this safe enough to tweet?"
[00:47:25.680 --> 00:47:27.760]   That's a good idea. I never put that on the Internet.
[00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:32.800]   Elon Musk, the SEC says that at least... Elon Musk did a consent decree with the
[00:47:32.800 --> 00:47:37.120]   S, Securities and Exchange Commission, that a lawyer would review his tweets before he tweet.
[00:47:37.120 --> 00:47:40.400]   Grimes is not going to keep him from tweeting back. She does not care.
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:42.800]   Honey, honey, is this okay to tweet?
[00:47:42.800 --> 00:47:45.760]   X-3249.
[00:47:45.760 --> 00:47:49.760]   Oh, she was tweeting about Communist the other day. So she called us all Communist the other day.
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:50.800]   That was great.
[00:47:50.800 --> 00:47:51.280]   All of us?
[00:47:51.280 --> 00:47:52.400]   Is that a good singer or bad thing?
[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:53.520]   She's just going on some...
[00:47:53.520 --> 00:47:58.400]   You know, before she was... She like... She's like... A long time ago, her and a friend like
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:02.560]   took a houseboat and took it the wrong way up a river and got stuck somewhere. So I'm like,
[00:48:02.560 --> 00:48:05.600]   "Eh, maybe not the..." Yeah.
[00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:09.680]   They were probably on Elon's specially designed submarine for rescuing those kids.
[00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:10.320]   Oh yeah, maybe.
[00:48:10.320 --> 00:48:11.520]   Oh god, yeah.
[00:48:11.520 --> 00:48:12.480]   Remember the submarine?
[00:48:12.480 --> 00:48:14.240]   He's a character.
[00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:21.600]   Anyway, the SEC says, "Mr. Musk flouted court-ordered policy in 2019 and 2020.
[00:48:21.600 --> 00:48:24.640]   He did not have..." I guess it's pretty apparent.
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:31.680]   A lawyer vet his tweets before he tweeted, and they're talking about two specific tweets.
[00:48:31.920 --> 00:48:40.560]   "Tesla Musk, the SEC did not reply to a Wall Street Journal's request for comment.
[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:44.080]   The Journal got the documents under the Freedom of Information Act.
[00:48:44.080 --> 00:48:48.160]   So, you know, they have only slapped him on the wrist ever.
[00:48:48.160 --> 00:48:51.040]   But maybe this would get a little more serious.
[00:48:51.040 --> 00:48:52.640]   He feels emboldened to do what he wants.
[00:48:52.640 --> 00:48:55.360]   He mocked the SEC after he settled with him.
[00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:55.760]   Oh yeah.
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:49:02.880]   He's like, "You know what? I really convinced. He does believe this is all a simulation.
[00:49:02.880 --> 00:49:06.400]   What's the worst that you can do with me is push the reset button, big deal."
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:10.960]   I think he's suffering from the same situation as Prince Hilton, quite frankly,
[00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:12.720]   but I don't have to get into that here.
[00:49:12.720 --> 00:49:17.600]   He tweeted after the SEC fraud settlement.
[00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:22.000]   He says, "The SEC is the short seller enrichment commission."
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.240]   And they're doing incredible work.
[00:49:24.800 --> 00:49:26.240]   [laughter]
[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:29.760]   So, because historically, Tesla had short sellers.
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:31.520]   So, our sellers are not a lot of friends.
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:34.560]   So, are you saying he has a mental illness?
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:38.800]   No, I don't think, I mean, look, I watched the Paris military.
[00:49:38.800 --> 00:49:40.000]   Paris, no, he's doing all right.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.360]   Did you watch the documentary on YouTube?
[00:49:41.360 --> 00:49:43.760]   Did you watch her documentary on YouTube?
[00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:45.520]   Which really just was just PR for her.
[00:49:45.520 --> 00:49:46.240]   Yeah, no.
[00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:47.040]   You didn't.
[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:47.440]   You did it.
[00:49:47.440 --> 00:49:47.840]   It's good?
[00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:49.760]   Well, it's sad. It's super sad.
[00:49:49.760 --> 00:49:53.440]   I mean, sad you're seeking out somebody who comes from extreme privilege and...
[00:49:53.440 --> 00:49:56.320]   I saw the Lady Gaga documentary.
[00:49:56.320 --> 00:49:56.880]   I've never seen it.
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:57.840]   I saw the...
[00:49:57.840 --> 00:49:58.960]   I will tell you that it's...
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:01.680]   Madonna documentary, I saw the Taylor Swift documentary.
[00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:02.720]   They're all sad.
[00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:05.920]   They're all normal people like you and me,
[00:50:05.920 --> 00:50:08.400]   who got thrust into insane fame,
[00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:10.320]   which ruined their lives.
[00:50:10.320 --> 00:50:12.400]   The parents who just were not parents,
[00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:13.680]   which is the life force.
[00:50:13.680 --> 00:50:14.240]   Well, Paris Hilton probably.
[00:50:14.240 --> 00:50:15.200]   But she's doing all right.
[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:16.320]   Her brands are huge.
[00:50:16.320 --> 00:50:17.200]   No, she doesn't sleep.
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:18.320]   Oh.
[00:50:18.320 --> 00:50:20.080]   Because, well, anyway, listen,
[00:50:20.080 --> 00:50:20.880]   there's not a matter I said.
[00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:22.160]   Oh, parents who don't sleep,
[00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:23.680]   because they're trying to provide for their children.
[00:50:23.680 --> 00:50:24.720]   Exactly.
[00:50:24.720 --> 00:50:29.440]   But anyway, what I'm trying to say is that she's just deeply...
[00:50:29.440 --> 00:50:32.400]   They're all just deeply flawed.
[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:34.960]   She makes $7 billion a year
[00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:37.520]   to be a DJ.
[00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:43.040]   You pay money to put like a million dollars for her to be the DJ at your club.
[00:50:43.040 --> 00:50:44.320]   Yeah, I got into the wrong business.
[00:50:44.320 --> 00:50:46.480]   And she doesn't sleep.
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:47.680]   You weren't famous.
[00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:49.120]   She doesn't sleep because...
[00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:50.240]   Didn't you hear what happened to her?
[00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:53.920]   She went to like that school in Utah where they look up to be sure.
[00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:54.800]   Well, she was abused.
[00:50:54.800 --> 00:50:55.280]   That's true.
[00:50:55.280 --> 00:50:57.360]   But anyway, what I'm trying to say all day.
[00:50:57.360 --> 00:50:59.600]   But I do also feel like that documentary was...
[00:50:59.600 --> 00:51:00.800]   It was PR.
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:02.160]   PR for her, right?
[00:51:02.160 --> 00:51:02.640]   Yeah.
[00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:06.000]   So like, you know, this is why you should feel sorry for me,
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:06.560]   even if I make it up.
[00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:09.760]   I just meant to bring her up as an example of what happens.
[00:51:09.760 --> 00:51:11.200]   Nature versus nurture.
[00:51:11.200 --> 00:51:13.120]   Elon probably wasn't nurtured.
[00:51:13.120 --> 00:51:13.920]   And the nature of...
[00:51:13.920 --> 00:51:16.080]   You're gonna blame his parents for his misbehaving?
[00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:16.080]   I don't know.
[00:51:16.080 --> 00:51:18.560]   I'm just trying to bring some semblance of something to this person.
[00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:19.200]   No, he's a human.
[00:51:19.200 --> 00:51:19.840]   I'm so angry.
[00:51:19.840 --> 00:51:20.800]   No, he's a human.
[00:51:20.800 --> 00:51:20.960]   Yeah.
[00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:22.080]   His mom's, I'm just great.
[00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:24.080]   She's in the cover girl commercials.
[00:51:24.080 --> 00:51:25.840]   Wait a minute.
[00:51:25.840 --> 00:51:26.400]   She's a model.
[00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:29.120]   Elon Musk's mom is in the cover girl commercials.
[00:51:29.120 --> 00:51:29.200]   She's a model.
[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:30.560]   I have to parse what you guys just said.
[00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:31.440]   It seems very nice.
[00:51:31.440 --> 00:51:34.080]   His dad is a emerald mine owner.
[00:51:34.080 --> 00:51:34.880]   Yes.
[00:51:34.880 --> 00:51:35.760]   Blood emeralds.
[00:51:35.760 --> 00:51:36.720]   He does not come...
[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:38.080]   He comes from money.
[00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:38.640]   He's not...
[00:51:38.640 --> 00:51:39.520]   Yeah.
[00:51:39.520 --> 00:51:41.360]   Anytime the story like goes down...
[00:51:41.360 --> 00:51:41.920]   He's a genius?
[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:43.920]   No.
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:44.880]   I don't think he's a genius.
[00:51:44.880 --> 00:51:45.760]   I think he's smart.
[00:51:45.760 --> 00:51:46.160]   Yes.
[00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:47.440]   I think he knows how to work the system.
[00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:48.640]   I don't think he's a genius.
[00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:51.120]   I think for a while I thought he was like...
[00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:51.840]   He could work the system.
[00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:52.880]   ...stark industries.
[00:51:52.880 --> 00:51:53.520]   Like he was...
[00:51:53.520 --> 00:51:56.640]   He surrounded himself with smart people.
[00:51:56.640 --> 00:51:58.880]   I mean, he didn't know anything about cars when he bought Tesla.
[00:51:58.880 --> 00:52:00.000]   Smart enough to make it work.
[00:52:00.000 --> 00:52:01.040]   Or invested in Tesla.
[00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:02.560]   He's not a founder of Tesla.
[00:52:02.560 --> 00:52:04.160]   These other people found it.
[00:52:04.160 --> 00:52:06.960]   He invested in it and then they sort of disappeared one day.
[00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:08.880]   And now he runs it and then he rewrote history
[00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:10.320]   that says that he is a founder of Tesla,
[00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:12.240]   which is again, not true.
[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:14.640]   I think he's smart.
[00:52:14.640 --> 00:52:17.200]   I think he's got this cult of personality
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:20.720]   that resonates very well with a lot of people.
[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:22.640]   A lot of people buy Tesla's because of Elon Musk.
[00:52:22.640 --> 00:52:23.840]   He's a con man, you think?
[00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:26.400]   I don't even know if he's a con man.
[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:27.120]   I think he's just...
[00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:28.160]   I loved my Model X.
[00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:32.080]   And I really appreciated what Elon did to promote electric vehicles.
[00:52:32.080 --> 00:52:35.600]   With that Elon, we would not have the idea for the Maxi.
[00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:37.760]   Those would still be five, 10 years away.
[00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:39.600]   He proved that this was economical.
[00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:41.760]   You could make money that people wanted these vehicles.
[00:52:41.760 --> 00:52:44.640]   He created a demand for something that had zero demand.
[00:52:44.640 --> 00:52:45.440]   Exactly.
[00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:47.920]   SpaceX, that seems like an accomplishment.
[00:52:47.920 --> 00:52:48.880]   Huge success.
[00:52:48.880 --> 00:52:51.760]   But it's best when he's not running it.
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:52.400]   You know what I mean?
[00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:54.240]   Well, he has these really great ideas.
[00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:58.080]   He has the capital and then he allows with SpaceX
[00:52:58.080 --> 00:53:00.480]   because they have to deal with the government.
[00:53:00.480 --> 00:53:02.000]   They have to deal with actual space.
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:02.800]   They have professional managers.
[00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:06.320]   It's a lot more difficult for him to go in there and metal.
[00:53:06.320 --> 00:53:09.200]   Tesla would be a better company for that professional manager.
[00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:12.240]   Yeah, so he's gone in and metaled and the production hell
[00:53:12.240 --> 00:53:15.920]   was because Elon thought that he could make the machine
[00:53:15.920 --> 00:53:16.880]   that would make the machine.
[00:53:16.880 --> 00:53:19.760]   Anytime there's issues with manufacturing,
[00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:23.760]   you look back at the fact that they had hired manufacturing
[00:53:23.760 --> 00:53:26.800]   like people who have been doing it for 20, 30 decades
[00:53:26.800 --> 00:53:29.920]   and they worked for Tesla and then they felt like they were being so
[00:53:29.920 --> 00:53:32.560]   micromanaged that they left.
[00:53:32.560 --> 00:53:35.200]   So you have people who were from the automotive industry
[00:53:35.200 --> 00:53:37.040]   who were just like, "Oh, I can't deal with this guy."
[00:53:37.040 --> 00:53:39.840]   And so they leave or they're fired or whatever.
[00:53:39.840 --> 00:53:41.680]   And so then at the end of the day,
[00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:43.600]   you have issues with manufacturing.
[00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:47.760]   The engineers that work for Tesla are amazing.
[00:53:47.760 --> 00:53:53.040]   Their ability to just squeeze efficient numbers
[00:53:53.040 --> 00:53:57.040]   out of their batteries and how their motors and etc.
[00:53:57.040 --> 00:53:59.440]   It's just mind-blowing.
[00:53:59.440 --> 00:54:02.640]   But then he had the cultural personality around Elon.
[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:05.600]   So by the way, my wife said, "Yes,
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:07.440]   I did jump out of a plane from low-die."
[00:54:07.440 --> 00:54:08.480]   Thank God, just come with us.
[00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:08.480]   Oh!
[00:54:10.320 --> 00:54:10.800]   There you go.
[00:54:10.800 --> 00:54:12.640]   Low-die.
[00:54:12.640 --> 00:54:13.120]   Low-die.
[00:54:13.120 --> 00:54:14.320]   Never again, Lisa.
[00:54:14.320 --> 00:54:15.280]   Don't do it.
[00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:16.240]   Don't do it anymore.
[00:54:16.240 --> 00:54:19.360]   Apparently there's skydiving and low-die don't go together.
[00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:20.240]   Don't go to low-die.
[00:54:20.240 --> 00:54:21.200]   Don't go to low-die.
[00:54:21.200 --> 00:54:21.760]   Don't go to low-die.
[00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:22.720]   Whoever's doing it, low-die.
[00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:24.320]   We don't.
[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:24.800]   We can audit it.
[00:54:24.800 --> 00:54:28.480]   I could say anything about that at all.
[00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:32.080]   I mean, people are complicated.
[00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:35.040]   I'm doing to say about the Paris Hilton comparison.
[00:54:35.040 --> 00:54:37.520]   You can be unhinged.
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:38.640]   I'm not saying he is unhinged,
[00:54:38.640 --> 00:54:40.560]   but you can do bizarre things.
[00:54:40.560 --> 00:54:42.480]   But also have accomplishments.
[00:54:42.480 --> 00:54:44.640]   And I think Tesla, when all of a sudden,
[00:54:44.640 --> 00:54:45.760]   that is an accomplishment,
[00:54:45.760 --> 00:54:47.600]   that it moved the whole industry,
[00:54:47.600 --> 00:54:48.800]   like Roberta said.
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:50.480]   I think SpaceX is an accomplishment.
[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:54.000]   I don't think he must be responsible
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:56.160]   to some degree for those things,
[00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:58.560]   even though he did not found Tesla.
[00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:00.720]   At least bringing the right people together in the right room.
[00:55:00.720 --> 00:55:01.920]   And sometimes that's like
[00:55:01.920 --> 00:55:04.880]   person who's just very charismatic,
[00:55:04.880 --> 00:55:06.080]   who can do that sort of thing.
[00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:08.640]   I think Elon coming into Tesla,
[00:55:08.640 --> 00:55:10.640]   Tesla was just sort of an oddity.
[00:55:10.640 --> 00:55:12.880]   It was just saying they essentially took the lotus
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:16.400]   and put an electric motor in it.
[00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:18.000]   And I think the Model S,
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:19.840]   and the smart people that he hired,
[00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:21.600]   to build that Model S,
[00:55:21.600 --> 00:55:23.600]   and the idea of making an electric car.
[00:55:23.600 --> 00:55:25.120]   You mean you still have to have the vision
[00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:26.880]   to make an electric car that is cool?
[00:55:26.880 --> 00:55:28.640]   I mean, that is real.
[00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:29.280]   That is him.
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:30.000]   It's more than that.
[00:55:30.000 --> 00:55:31.440]   His electric car manifesto,
[00:55:31.440 --> 00:55:33.280]   which he wrote at the very beginning,
[00:55:33.280 --> 00:55:36.560]   was a roadmap for how you make electric cars succeed.
[00:55:36.560 --> 00:55:38.720]   And it included things like the supercharger network,
[00:55:38.720 --> 00:55:40.400]   which he was absolutely right about,
[00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:43.040]   without that people wouldn't have bought electric cars.
[00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:44.640]   And in fact, that's what other companies
[00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:45.760]   are now trying to duplicate,
[00:55:45.760 --> 00:55:46.560]   because they realize,
[00:55:46.560 --> 00:55:51.440]   and there's a problem with not only getting to a charger,
[00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:52.720]   but getting to one that works,
[00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:56.240]   and then getting out of there on a reasonable amount of time,
[00:55:56.240 --> 00:55:57.360]   and all that Elon Musk would be getting.
[00:55:57.360 --> 00:55:59.040]   The killer app at Tesla is that charging network.
[00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:00.160]   Yeah.
[00:56:00.160 --> 00:56:00.640]   You can't--
[00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:01.440]   I wouldn't have bought it.
[00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:01.920]   But the electric car--
[00:56:01.920 --> 00:56:04.240]   Electrify America is doing its best to catch up,
[00:56:04.240 --> 00:56:05.680]   and they're moving very quickly,
[00:56:05.680 --> 00:56:08.160]   but they still cannot beat that supercharger network.
[00:56:08.160 --> 00:56:08.640]   No, that's right.
[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:10.560]   Henry Ford was a WACO,
[00:56:10.560 --> 00:56:11.760]   and he was terrible too.
[00:56:11.760 --> 00:56:12.800]   Terrible, I mean.
[00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:14.080]   No, that's right.
[00:56:14.080 --> 00:56:15.520]   You still got to give him some credit.
[00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:16.960]   Yeah, as an entrepreneur,
[00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:19.120]   he created an industry--
[00:56:19.120 --> 00:56:20.560]   Your job's as awful.
[00:56:20.560 --> 00:56:22.240]   We didn't even recognize his daughter
[00:56:22.240 --> 00:56:23.600]   for a couple years of her life.
[00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:24.240]   But--
[00:56:24.240 --> 00:56:24.880]   That's a good point.
[00:56:24.880 --> 00:56:26.560]   Maybe there is something that,
[00:56:26.560 --> 00:56:28.640]   in order to be a success like that,
[00:56:28.640 --> 00:56:31.600]   you have to be a little different.
[00:56:31.600 --> 00:56:32.960]   Unfortunately, you can't have it all.
[00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:34.400]   Yeah.
[00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:35.440]   You can't get about that.
[00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:36.000]   You're not going to be changing.
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:38.320]   Normal, say, and being unbelievably successful.
[00:56:38.320 --> 00:56:39.200]   You can't go about it all.
[00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:40.400]   That's with each other.
[00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:42.640]   Somebody in the chatroom said, interestingly,
[00:56:42.640 --> 00:56:47.440]   this is Diggle in the chatroom.
[00:56:47.440 --> 00:56:49.840]   He said, "Bords don't like strong leaders.
[00:56:49.840 --> 00:56:52.000]   What's happening to must happen to jobs and gates
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.240]   as soon as people smell success, they want them out."
[00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:57.040]   The board of Tesla is filled with Elon's friends.
[00:56:57.040 --> 00:56:58.000]   They're not getting rid of him.
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:59.120]   They're not getting rid of Elon.
[00:56:59.120 --> 00:56:59.840]   That's the problem.
[00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:00.400]   Come on.
[00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:00.960]   They're never doing--
[00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:02.400]   And in fact, I think you can make the case
[00:57:03.040 --> 00:57:04.800]   certainly getting rid of jobs is a mistake.
[00:57:04.800 --> 00:57:09.440]   But you can make the case that that's the job of a board
[00:57:09.440 --> 00:57:11.680]   is to tell a founder, "You know what?
[00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:14.160]   You are the right person to start this company
[00:57:14.160 --> 00:57:17.040]   and build this company, but now we need a professional manager
[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:18.000]   in your position."
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:19.440]   Well, in their bottom line is cash.
[00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:22.240]   And if you're not making the cash, buddy, skedaddle.
[00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:22.880]   Yeah.
[00:57:22.880 --> 00:57:27.840]   Jobs did come back to Apple way better manager than--
[00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:28.240]   Yes.
[00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:31.360]   I mean, there is some chance he might never have gotten to where he was
[00:57:31.360 --> 00:57:32.560]   if he had not been fired.
[00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:36.080]   There's that great book called "Becoming Steve Jobs"
[00:57:36.080 --> 00:57:38.560]   that is really kind of about the transition
[00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:40.640]   Jobs went through.
[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:42.960]   It was written by the two reporters from Seattle
[00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:44.160]   who had covered jobs.
[00:57:44.160 --> 00:57:48.560]   It was Brent Schlunder and my former colleague, Rick Tzeling.
[00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:48.800]   Right.
[00:57:48.800 --> 00:57:53.840]   And it was good because it talked about this exact thing
[00:57:53.840 --> 00:57:57.760]   that Steve had a journey, a hero's journey,
[00:57:57.760 --> 00:58:00.720]   because he was a dick when he was first at Apple.
[00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:05.120]   And he did things like he ripped off Wozniak multiple times.
[00:58:05.120 --> 00:58:08.960]   But then he was out in the wilderness
[00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:10.720]   and he learned he became a better human being
[00:58:10.720 --> 00:58:13.520]   and came back and in fact was a better CEO.
[00:58:13.520 --> 00:58:15.840]   I mean, he certainly became a way more disciplined,
[00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:17.040]   human being than he had been.
[00:58:17.040 --> 00:58:17.760]   Yeah.
[00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:21.280]   That's actually one of the best better jobs book I think than the
[00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:22.960]   Isaac Simbier.
[00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:23.680]   It is really good.
[00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:23.920]   Yeah.
[00:58:23.920 --> 00:58:26.240]   I didn't know you knew Rick.
[00:58:26.240 --> 00:58:29.440]   Rick was used to be a fast company.
[00:58:29.440 --> 00:58:29.920]   Very good.
[00:58:29.920 --> 00:58:31.040]   Very well done book.
[00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:32.720]   Let's take a quick little break.
[00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:33.520]   Good panel here.
[00:58:33.520 --> 00:58:36.320]   It's too good of a panel and because they're all in studio,
[00:58:36.320 --> 00:58:37.200]   we're having too much fun.
[00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:37.920]   I apologize.
[00:58:37.920 --> 00:58:41.440]   Sometimes we get these shows.
[00:58:41.440 --> 00:58:43.040]   We're just having too much fun.
[00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:47.120]   So I hope you're having as much fun as we are along with us.
[00:58:47.120 --> 00:58:51.120]   And if not, well, I'm sorry.
[00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:53.840]   Our show today, Pro TV.
[00:58:53.840 --> 00:58:55.440]   I don't anticipate getting any better.
[00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:59.200]   IT Pro TV has been with us since they started.
[00:58:59.200 --> 00:59:02.720]   In fact, I remember meeting the two guys, the two founders,
[00:59:02.720 --> 00:59:06.800]   Tim Broome and Don Pazette in Novagus at NAB,
[00:59:06.800 --> 00:59:09.040]   the National Association of Broadcasters' Show.
[00:59:09.040 --> 00:59:10.960]   They came to a panel we had.
[00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:13.680]   Adam Corolla was there.
[00:59:13.680 --> 00:59:14.080]   I was there.
[00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:16.960]   A bunch of people talking about streaming broadcasting
[00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:18.720]   and these guys were trainers.
[00:59:18.720 --> 00:59:20.320]   They did IT training in the classroom.
[00:59:20.320 --> 00:59:22.240]   They said, you know, this would be interesting.
[00:59:22.240 --> 00:59:24.720]   What if we did what we do in the classroom,
[00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:27.280]   but did it like Twitch streamed it?
[00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:28.640]   And IT Pro TV was born.
[00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:31.120]   They have absolutely surpassed us now.
[00:59:31.120 --> 00:59:33.760]   They have seven studios operating all day,
[00:59:33.760 --> 00:59:34.720]   Monday through Friday.
[00:59:34.720 --> 00:59:40.240]   Because in the IT business, nothing stays the same, right?
[00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:42.000]   They're training you for the great search
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:44.000]   so that you can get your first job in IT,
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:45.520]   or you get re-certified.
[00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:47.520]   They're training IT professionals
[00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:51.040]   to improve their skills, to broaden their horizons,
[00:59:51.040 --> 00:59:53.360]   to, you know, getting better jobs.
[00:59:53.920 --> 00:59:56.960]   And in order to do that, you have to keep up with the constant change
[00:59:56.960 --> 00:59:59.680]   in the tests, the constant change in software,
[00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:02.240]   the all the new fields, and that's what they do.
[01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:04.880]   5,800 hours of on-demand content,
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:06.400]   but all of it up to date,
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:09.440]   because they're always making new stuff.
[01:00:09.440 --> 01:00:11.840]   Of course, cybersecurity,
[01:00:11.840 --> 01:00:15.280]   one of the top topics these days in IT.
[01:00:15.280 --> 01:00:18.400]   And if you're an IT leader, an organization,
[01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:20.320]   you really got to keep your knowledge up to date.
[01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:22.800]   You got to understand what's going on in security,
[01:00:22.800 --> 01:00:25.200]   the new attacks, the new ways of protecting yourself.
[01:00:25.200 --> 01:00:29.040]   Individuals and businesses both go to IT Pro TV to learn that,
[01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:31.600]   whether you're a cybersecurity novice or an expert,
[01:00:31.600 --> 01:00:34.000]   IT Pro TV gives you the most up-to-date,
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:36.480]   most important information and tutorials,
[01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:40.080]   and they do it in a way that's engaging and fun.
[01:00:40.080 --> 01:00:41.680]   People like watching.
[01:00:41.680 --> 01:00:44.800]   It's not boring, and that's important.
[01:00:44.800 --> 01:00:48.000]   They've got cybersecurity courses for every area,
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.360]   MTA networking fundamentals, MTA security fundamentals.
[01:00:51.360 --> 01:00:53.680]   June is Hacker Month at IT Pro TV.
[01:00:53.680 --> 01:00:54.560]   I love this.
[01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:57.200]   They've been doing monthly topics this month.
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:58.400]   They're going to have a free weekend
[01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:00.320]   with five free hacking courses.
[01:01:00.320 --> 01:01:03.360]   That's next weekend, June 12th and 13th,
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:05.760]   including my favorite cert.
[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:07.440]   If I could pick one cert to get it,
[01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:11.840]   it would be the Certified Ethical Hacker cert from EC Council.
[01:01:11.840 --> 01:01:13.760]   Wouldn't that be nice to have that on your resume?
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:15.920]   Oh, yes, I may certify an Ethical Hacker.
[01:01:15.920 --> 01:01:18.720]   CompTIA has a cert, Pentest Plus,
[01:01:18.720 --> 01:01:20.000]   part of their Plus series.
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.120]   They'll be a webinar, June 17th with YouTuber John Hammond
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:24.320]   on Reverse Malware.
[01:01:24.320 --> 01:01:26.800]   That'll be on demand afterwards.
[01:01:26.800 --> 01:01:29.920]   This is a great month to get started with IT Pro TV.
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:33.520]   IT Pro TV, the IT training and certifications you need
[01:01:33.520 --> 01:01:35.520]   to be successful.
[01:01:35.520 --> 01:01:37.040]   The perfect place to learn.
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:38.080]   And not just security.
[01:01:38.080 --> 01:01:41.760]   Apple, Python, Cisco, so many more skills.
[01:01:41.760 --> 01:01:44.080]   They're the official video training partner for CompTIA.
[01:01:44.080 --> 01:01:47.120]   So if you're getting those very desirable
[01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:50.960]   A+ network plus security plus Pentest Plus certs,
[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:52.800]   you're going to get the best training around.
[01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:56.960]   It's also a great place to get an IT education
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:59.120]   because you can do it anytime, anywhere.
[01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:00.960]   Even if you have a day job,
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:03.840]   their courses are live and on demand worldwide.
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:06.480]   You can watch on your Roku, on your Apple TV,
[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:08.800]   of course, on your computer, on your iOS
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:09.840]   or Android device.
[01:02:09.840 --> 01:02:12.000]   They have apps, works with Chromecast.
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:15.120]   One reviewer said, "I really like the way IT Pro TV
[01:02:15.120 --> 01:02:16.480]   makes you feel like you're right in the room
[01:02:16.480 --> 01:02:18.960]   with the teachers." I like how you can watch on Roku.
[01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:20.240]   The instruction is really clear.
[01:02:20.240 --> 01:02:21.600]   You can understand the content.
[01:02:21.600 --> 01:02:22.560]   The teachers are great.
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:23.680]   They call them edutators.
[01:02:23.680 --> 01:02:24.880]   They all work in the field.
[01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:26.080]   So they are real experts,
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:28.000]   but they're also really know how to communicate.
[01:02:28.000 --> 01:02:28.720]   That's important.
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:29.680]   Hard to find too.
[01:02:29.680 --> 01:02:31.360]   IT Pro TV has them.

[01:03:02.640 --> 01:03:04.720]   well, more than two,
[01:03:04.720 --> 01:03:06.880]   Don and Tim, but then all the great trainers.
[01:03:06.880 --> 01:03:09.440]   The best people for learning an IT.
[01:03:09.440 --> 01:03:11.840]   ITPro.tv/twit.
[01:03:11.840 --> 01:03:14.400]   We thank them so much for their support of this week.
[01:03:15.120 --> 01:03:20.080]   In tech, let's go back to the fine,
[01:03:20.080 --> 01:03:21.920]   I guess we've talked Elon Musk out.
[01:03:21.920 --> 01:03:23.680]   I'm not going to do any more Elon Musk stories.
[01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:25.920]   Yeah, it's not going anywhere.
[01:03:25.920 --> 01:03:26.560]   It's not going anywhere.
[01:03:26.560 --> 01:03:27.360]   Who else can we talk about?
[01:03:27.360 --> 01:03:28.720]   Oh, Donald Trump, that'd be good.
[01:03:28.720 --> 01:03:34.640]   Let's CNN, Anderson Cooper.
[01:03:34.640 --> 01:03:35.600]   And Robby's gone.
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:36.480]   He fell over.
[01:03:36.480 --> 01:03:38.800]   He went to have to get popcorn and pizza.
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:41.120]   I'm sorry, Popeyes.
[01:03:41.120 --> 01:03:42.720]   No, Popeyes or a pancake.
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:44.480]   So, when from Z.
[01:03:44.480 --> 01:03:45.520]   Only things with P.
[01:03:45.520 --> 01:03:46.880]   Food starts with P.O.
[01:03:46.880 --> 01:03:47.920]   Liturgy and food.
[01:03:47.920 --> 01:03:50.320]   That's why he goes to the water parks.
[01:03:50.320 --> 01:03:51.200]   There's lots of P there too.
[01:03:51.200 --> 01:03:52.080]   Lots of P there too.
[01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:52.560]   The water.
[01:03:52.560 --> 01:03:54.160]   A little P.
[01:03:54.160 --> 01:03:56.640]   I was going to say, Anderson Cooper doesn't call him,
[01:03:56.640 --> 01:03:57.920]   doesn't call him by name.
[01:03:57.920 --> 01:03:59.520]   Like he who shall not be named.
[01:03:59.520 --> 01:04:01.360]   He calls him the man from Mar-a-Lago.
[01:04:01.360 --> 01:04:04.160]   He will not be going back to Facebook.
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:07.120]   The oversight board ruled that,
[01:04:07.120 --> 01:04:09.360]   okay, it's okay that you can do that,
[01:04:09.360 --> 01:04:12.320]   but you shouldn't have it be indefinite, open ended.
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:13.680]   They went back to Facebook and said,
[01:04:13.680 --> 01:04:14.800]   you need to set a term.
[01:04:14.800 --> 01:04:19.280]   The Facebook has decided to keep the suspension for two years.
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:22.720]   So, to June, they suspended his account,
[01:04:22.720 --> 01:04:26.720]   June 6, 2021, June 7, 2024,
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:28.720]   his account will be back.
[01:04:28.720 --> 01:04:31.840]   If conditions permit, they say,
[01:04:31.840 --> 01:04:34.320]   I'm not sure what that means.
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:35.760]   I think that they're probably figuring
[01:04:35.760 --> 01:04:37.520]   if he's running for president,
[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:39.120]   you know, it's going to be hard for them.
[01:04:39.120 --> 01:04:41.360]   And this was the problem both Twitter and Facebook had.
[01:04:41.360 --> 01:04:42.480]   First, he's running for president.
[01:04:42.480 --> 01:04:45.680]   You don't want to shut up a candidate of a major party.
[01:04:45.680 --> 01:04:46.960]   And then he's president.
[01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:49.760]   It's kind of problematic to shut him up.
[01:04:49.760 --> 01:04:54.640]   Notice both of them killed his account
[01:04:54.640 --> 01:04:56.160]   after the January 6th in direction,
[01:04:56.160 --> 01:04:59.840]   but just weeks before President Biden was to take office.
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:05.200]   So, Facebook has announced suspension will
[01:05:05.200 --> 01:05:11.200]   potentially be revoked January 7th, 2024, two years.
[01:05:11.200 --> 01:05:13.280]   At the end of this period, they say,
[01:05:13.280 --> 01:05:14.720]   we will look to experts.
[01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:19.840]   Mark is nothing if not a master of passing the buck.
[01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:22.320]   We will look to experts to assess whether the risk
[01:05:22.320 --> 01:05:26.320]   to public safety has receded like his hairline.
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:28.080]   We will evaluate external factors,
[01:05:28.080 --> 01:05:29.520]   including instances of violence,
[01:05:29.520 --> 01:05:31.280]   restrictions on peaceful assembly,
[01:05:31.280 --> 01:05:33.360]   and other markers of civil or unrest.
[01:05:34.160 --> 01:05:36.800]   If we determine there's still a serious risk to public safely,
[01:05:36.800 --> 01:05:39.200]   we'll extend the restriction for a set period of time
[01:05:39.200 --> 01:05:41.360]   as the oversight board required,
[01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:43.120]   and then continue to reevaluate.
[01:05:43.120 --> 01:05:44.720]   Right decision?
[01:05:44.720 --> 01:05:46.960]   Yes, I think like it.
[01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:48.160]   Yeah, any, any, any one,
[01:05:48.160 --> 01:05:49.840]   I don't care if you're the president.
[01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:52.080]   I don't care if you're the grand emperor of the universe.
[01:05:52.080 --> 01:05:54.560]   If you're on a social media site
[01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:58.320]   and you're just spouting off things that puts people in danger
[01:05:58.320 --> 01:06:01.040]   or is just flatly incorrect,
[01:06:01.040 --> 01:06:02.880]   especially when you have a very large audience,
[01:06:02.880 --> 01:06:04.320]   then maybe you don't get to be there.
[01:06:04.320 --> 01:06:05.440]   And also Facebook,
[01:06:05.440 --> 01:06:06.320]   we don't have to be there.
[01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:08.080]   We're not the arbitrator of truth.
[01:06:08.080 --> 01:06:10.400]   They've been kicking people off their site for years,
[01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:13.520]   for just random weird things.
[01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:17.120]   They've been kicking people off their sites for using aliases,
[01:06:17.120 --> 01:06:18.960]   people who, you know, domestic abuse victims.
[01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:20.960]   I mean, every time Facebook says,
[01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:22.720]   we're not the arbitrator of truth.
[01:06:22.720 --> 01:06:26.640]   Of course they want to, I want to kick Mark Zuckerberg
[01:06:26.640 --> 01:06:28.320]   and his lily white shins.
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:31.520]   They also did something related,
[01:06:31.520 --> 01:06:32.720]   which seems very sensible,
[01:06:32.720 --> 01:06:37.520]   which as previously they said that politicians had this
[01:06:37.520 --> 01:06:39.520]   newsworthiness exception,
[01:06:39.520 --> 01:06:42.000]   which let them say things.
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.160]   They couldn't have said if they weren't politicians.
[01:06:44.160 --> 01:06:47.520]   And they still say they do have a newsworthiness exemption,
[01:06:47.520 --> 01:06:49.840]   but it's not just for politicians, it's for anyone.
[01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:53.600]   So there's no free pass just because you're an elected official
[01:06:53.600 --> 01:06:56.560]   or a politician, which seems entirely logical.
[01:06:56.560 --> 01:06:58.640]   I could see though how hard this is because,
[01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:02.400]   I mean, if you're a leader of a nation,
[01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:04.400]   whether it's a US or any nation,
[01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:07.760]   everything you say is important,
[01:07:07.760 --> 01:07:10.400]   whether it's a lie or inciting, it's important.
[01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:14.560]   But I can also understand you wouldn't want to be the platform
[01:07:14.560 --> 01:07:17.200]   for speech that's dangerous to other people.
[01:07:17.200 --> 01:07:19.520]   What's crazy is that as the president of the United States,
[01:07:19.520 --> 01:07:20.800]   you have a platform.
[01:07:20.800 --> 01:07:22.240]   It's called the press department.
[01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:24.640]   It's called, you might even have a press release.
[01:07:24.640 --> 01:07:26.000]   Yeah, you might have your own blog.
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:26.560]   What do you have?
[01:07:26.560 --> 01:07:30.240]   You don't have access to like every network in the world.
[01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:32.800]   Actually Trump's blog has now been shut down.
[01:07:32.800 --> 01:07:35.040]   Oh well, you had a blog.
[01:07:35.040 --> 01:07:38.960]   You should have gone with a live journal or something.
[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:42.160]   That's owned by the Russians.
[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:42.640]   Is it?
[01:07:42.640 --> 01:07:43.040]   Yes.
[01:07:43.040 --> 01:07:43.680]   It would have been perfect.
[01:07:43.680 --> 01:07:44.320]   Yeah, I know.
[01:07:44.320 --> 01:07:51.120]   Yeah, the politicians who are whining about,
[01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:54.400]   oh no one, we're being wrongly criticized
[01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:56.400]   or the social networks are coming after us.
[01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:59.360]   First of all, if you look at the top Facebook posts every day,
[01:07:59.360 --> 01:08:02.480]   it's almost always some sort of right wing something,
[01:08:02.480 --> 01:08:03.600]   conservative something.
[01:08:03.600 --> 01:08:05.520]   That's fine.
[01:08:05.520 --> 01:08:09.440]   But that doesn't mean just because they're blocking you
[01:08:09.440 --> 01:08:11.760]   or kicking you off, you still have a press department.
[01:08:11.760 --> 01:08:13.200]   You can still call a press.
[01:08:13.200 --> 01:08:14.400]   What if you're not though?
[01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:15.760]   What if you're the former president?
[01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:18.240]   I guess Trump could, I mean he's going to speak.
[01:08:18.240 --> 01:08:21.120]   I mean I still hear whatever Jimmy Carter wants to say something
[01:08:21.120 --> 01:08:23.920]   and I say whenever, you know, and you still lose a newsmaker.
[01:08:23.920 --> 01:08:26.240]   You're still, you know, Bill Clinton goes out all the time
[01:08:26.240 --> 01:08:27.680]   and plays saxophone or something.
[01:08:27.680 --> 01:08:28.080]   I don't know.
[01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:30.080]   The president said, "Come to Mar-a-Lago,
[01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:32.240]   I have a big announcement to make people would go."
[01:08:32.240 --> 01:08:35.440]   Yeah, they would get some news outlets would go.
[01:08:35.440 --> 01:08:36.080]   And he has-
[01:08:36.080 --> 01:08:37.120]   And all of them would go.
[01:08:37.120 --> 01:08:40.480]   And I think he has news outlets that are essentially in his pocket
[01:08:40.480 --> 01:08:42.720]   that will be more than happy to go and cover it.
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:43.920]   That's right, Tucker Carlson.
[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:46.320]   And the people who want to hear it.
[01:08:46.320 --> 01:08:47.760]   Oh wait, oh wait, oh wait.
[01:08:47.760 --> 01:08:49.280]   Yeah, own, oh wait.
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:49.840]   Oh wait, oh wait.
[01:08:49.840 --> 01:08:50.400]   Is it awesome?
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:53.360]   Weird, they look like dubious.
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:55.200]   They look dubious.
[01:08:55.200 --> 01:08:56.480]   Well, you know.
[01:08:56.480 --> 01:08:58.960]   But you know, you have platforms
[01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:02.080]   and you just don't have this one platform anymore.
[01:09:02.080 --> 01:09:03.520]   Oh, these two platforms anymore.
[01:09:03.520 --> 01:09:03.840]   Right.
[01:09:03.840 --> 01:09:07.840]   And that's, you know, that's, you know, playing with fire.
[01:09:07.840 --> 01:09:10.480]   I guess my math is bad, but so is Facebook's.
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:13.040]   They said two years, but it's to 2024.
[01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:15.680]   Or was it 2023?
[01:09:15.680 --> 01:09:16.960]   I thought it was 2024.
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:18.320]   I thought it was 2023 because-
[01:09:18.320 --> 01:09:19.200]   Oh, it's okay.
[01:09:19.200 --> 01:09:20.240]   Because it-
[01:09:20.240 --> 01:09:22.000]   Because the election is in 2020.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:23.360]   But that point is running for president.
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:23.680]   That's right.
[01:09:23.680 --> 01:09:24.880]   That's kind of a big deal.
[01:09:24.880 --> 01:09:26.480]   That's why the election is in 2024.
[01:09:26.480 --> 01:09:28.400]   Oh my god, you get run for president again.
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:29.120]   Of course you can.
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:30.000]   So can you.
[01:09:30.000 --> 01:09:30.480]   You can run for president.
[01:09:30.480 --> 01:09:31.360]   No, you're too young.
[01:09:31.360 --> 01:09:32.640]   No, wait.
[01:09:32.640 --> 01:09:34.000]   No, I don't want to document-
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:34.720]   No, I just-
[01:09:34.720 --> 01:09:35.280]   I just-
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:36.480]   You're now-
[01:09:36.480 --> 01:09:37.040]   No, I-
[01:09:37.040 --> 01:09:37.680]   Of legal age-
[01:09:37.680 --> 01:09:39.120]   I've been eligible for a few years.
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:39.520]   Thank you.
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:40.320]   Oh.
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:41.280]   So what about this?
[01:09:41.280 --> 01:09:42.960]   I thought we'd never get old.
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:44.880]   I know it's for tonight.
[01:09:44.880 --> 01:09:50.400]   The federal government of Nigeria has suspended indefinitely.
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:51.680]   The operations of Twitter.
[01:09:51.680 --> 01:09:52.400]   Yeah, I saw that.
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:52.880]   That was-
[01:09:53.920 --> 01:09:56.400]   So this is the reverse, right?
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:10:02.400]   Twitter's been banned in Nigeria because they pulled down tweets and videos
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:04.960]   the president, Muhammadu Buhari, had made,
[01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:08.880]   making threats of punishment to a sect in the southeastern part of Nigeria.
[01:10:08.880 --> 01:10:12.160]   He blamed them for attacks on government buildings.
[01:10:12.160 --> 01:10:16.800]   And so they pulled those tweets down last week.
[01:10:16.800 --> 01:10:19.120]   Maybe inappropriately.
[01:10:19.120 --> 01:10:21.920]   I mean, again, once again, he's the head of a country,
[01:10:21.920 --> 01:10:24.720]   making a threat to another part of the country,
[01:10:24.720 --> 01:10:26.320]   that is kind of important.
[01:10:26.320 --> 01:10:29.760]   But at the same time, is it inciting violence?
[01:10:29.760 --> 01:10:30.960]   Maybe they decided it was.
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:32.080]   I think I went to Donald Trump move.
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:35.680]   There was definitely a consequence because when Twitter pulled those down,
[01:10:35.680 --> 01:10:40.720]   the federal government put them out of business in Nigeria.
[01:10:40.720 --> 01:10:46.240]   In fact, they also established a licensing system.
[01:10:47.440 --> 01:10:53.360]   Now the government will license all social media operations and streaming television networks.
[01:10:53.360 --> 01:10:57.440]   And it's one of those things where nature will find a way.
[01:10:57.440 --> 01:11:00.960]   I mean, they shouldn't have pulled all this stuff down,
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:03.840]   but it's also people in China are still able to get on things.
[01:11:03.840 --> 01:11:07.360]   Yeah, I don't know enough about Nigerian politics or what was going on in Nigeria to know
[01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:09.040]   whether it was proper to pull those down.
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:14.320]   I'm sure Twitter has people who, you know, I mean, good Lord, you have to do that, don't you?
[01:11:14.320 --> 01:11:15.840]   If you're Twitter, you have to know every-
[01:11:15.840 --> 01:11:17.520]   the politics of every country and whether-
[01:11:17.520 --> 01:11:18.960]   Well, they should hire somebody to do that.
[01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:20.000]   That's why they have a-
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:24.480]   It's a degree you can get in international relations at San Francisco State University,
[01:11:24.480 --> 01:11:26.960]   so that you can get hired and talk about that stuff.
[01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:29.200]   I hope somebody from San Francisco State deciding that.
[01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:29.760]   That would be good.
[01:11:29.760 --> 01:11:31.520]   It better because that's my own lawyer.
[01:11:31.520 --> 01:11:33.760]   So, hooray for public institutions.
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:37.280]   But in all seriousness, it's kind of a bummer to
[01:11:37.280 --> 01:11:41.040]   punish the whole population for this.
[01:11:41.840 --> 01:11:47.280]   And especially in a country that does not have the kind of money that I'm sorry China has.
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:52.640]   And people, you know, there's way more opportunity in China for folks than there is in Nigeria.
[01:11:52.640 --> 01:11:59.040]   So to get rid of a way, you know, that people communicate and organize with all the, you know,
[01:11:59.040 --> 01:12:00.000]   political turmoil.
[01:12:00.000 --> 01:12:04.960]   Twitter tweeted, "We're deeply concerned about the blocking of Twitter in Nigeria.
[01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:09.360]   Access to the free and open internet is an essential human right in modern society.
[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:12.480]   We'll work through a store access for those of all those in Nigeria
[01:12:12.480 --> 01:12:14.480]   who rely on Twitter to communicate and connect the world."
[01:12:14.480 --> 01:12:18.320]   I don't know how huge or irrelevant Twitter is in Nigeria.
[01:12:18.320 --> 01:12:25.520]   But of course, immediately a lot of people responded to Twitter's tweet, "You suspend a former
[01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:28.240]   president while allowing terrorists to tweet. No one believes you."
[01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:33.840]   It's it's it.
[01:12:33.840 --> 01:12:35.200]   I don't envy them.
[01:12:35.200 --> 01:12:36.160]   It's a complicated thing.
[01:12:36.160 --> 01:12:38.240]   It's probably not as hard as being Paris Hilton.
[01:12:38.240 --> 01:12:40.000]   But it's it's difficult.
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:41.120]   It's difficult.
[01:12:41.120 --> 01:12:41.520]   It is.
[01:12:41.520 --> 01:12:41.920]   I don't know.
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:44.560]   Well, now they have to navigate it though, because after what happened,
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:44.640]   they have to.
[01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:44.880]   They have to.
[01:12:44.880 --> 01:12:47.360]   General Trump and everything that happened here.
[01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:47.920]   I'm sorry.
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:49.920]   You got to hire some people to help you navigate this.
[01:12:49.920 --> 01:12:52.560]   Yeah, you can't you can't put your head and stick your head in the ground anymore.
[01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:53.440]   It's about two dollars.
[01:12:53.440 --> 01:12:54.720]   Not a not a not a not a.
[01:12:54.720 --> 01:12:55.760]   Can't do anything about it.
[01:12:55.760 --> 01:13:00.880]   Yeah, you you had that chance way 15 years ago to like, oh, we're just
[01:13:00.880 --> 01:13:02.720]   just making things.
[01:13:02.720 --> 01:13:04.720]   Now you have to like step up and be adults.
[01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:05.280]   Yeah.
[01:13:05.280 --> 01:13:05.760]   Sorry.
[01:13:05.760 --> 01:13:06.400]   You're an adult.
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:07.520]   You're an adult company.
[01:13:07.520 --> 01:13:09.840]   Make adult decisions due to do adult things.
[01:13:09.840 --> 01:13:10.800]   Yeah.
[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:15.280]   Harry, you're I noticed using the 11 inch the new iPad Pro with the M1 chip.
[01:13:15.280 --> 01:13:17.040]   I got the 12.9 inch.
[01:13:17.040 --> 01:13:22.480]   You're using the magic the beautiful new lily white shins of the magic keyboard.
[01:13:22.480 --> 01:13:26.960]   And I'm using the I got the combo touch from Logitech.
[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:31.760]   I completely agree with your article at Fast Company that this is amazing hardware
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:34.080]   in search of amazing software.
[01:13:34.080 --> 01:13:36.640]   That's what basically 100% of reviews said.
[01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:43.760]   It's way more just in terms of computational muscle.
[01:13:43.760 --> 01:13:47.920]   It's way more powerful than previous iPad, but the software is the same.
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:52.240]   Even if it's possible of doing incredible things with video editing.
[01:13:52.240 --> 01:13:59.840]   There is LumaFusion, which is quite good, but most people who do serious video editing,
[01:13:59.840 --> 01:14:03.280]   you know, are interested in something like final cut pro, which does not exist.
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:08.000]   I bought the 12.9 because I wanted to try the micro LED screen.
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:10.960]   Or I'm sorry, mini LED screen.
[01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:11.600]   Mini LED.
[01:14:11.600 --> 01:14:12.960]   And I can't tell it.
[01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:18.640]   But I thought I thought there's enough juice in this is enough RAM, 16 gigs of RAM.
[01:14:18.640 --> 01:14:20.000]   First time they've ever offered anything.
[01:14:20.000 --> 01:14:20.320]   Dang.
[01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:21.120]   And that is great.
[01:14:21.120 --> 01:14:26.720]   I have to say that I've noticed that apps are far less likely to have to refresh themselves.
[01:14:26.720 --> 01:14:30.720]   Although the folks at Procreate said, you know, we can't allocate more than five gigs for any
[01:14:30.720 --> 01:14:31.920]   any individual app.
[01:14:31.920 --> 01:14:35.280]   Yeah, I mean, I think they can't kind of go to the next level and create an app that
[01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:40.800]   that might be something that requires that stuff gets flushed out of memory less and so
[01:14:40.800 --> 01:14:41.120]   Wow.
[01:14:41.120 --> 01:14:43.840]   Scrivener, which I use all day long in the old days.
[01:14:43.840 --> 01:14:44.320]   Pops up.
[01:14:44.320 --> 01:14:46.080]   Almost every time I went, we'd go back to it.
[01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:46.320]   Yeah.
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:50.800]   It would have to reset itself and it would exit out of the document I was in.
[01:14:50.800 --> 01:14:52.960]   And now Scrivener stays up for days at a time.
[01:14:52.960 --> 01:14:54.240]   So I am way more productive.
[01:14:54.240 --> 01:14:58.800]   Actually, that would be a good list to put together is the apps that really benefit from
[01:14:58.800 --> 01:15:00.560]   the RAM and the processor.
[01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:04.240]   Kindle for whatever reason, you wouldn't think that eBooks would take up all that much memory,
[01:15:04.240 --> 01:15:06.400]   but Kindle seems to run better on this.
[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:07.760]   They can be quite big, actually.
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:10.320]   They're going to be a gigabyte or more in size.
[01:15:10.320 --> 01:15:16.000]   You actually make a really excellent point that this is the opposite of planned obsolescence.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:19.520]   They built this is this is this is way overbuilt.
[01:15:19.520 --> 01:15:24.800]   The only reason the main reason I bought a new iPad Pro is after I used the iPad Air
[01:15:24.800 --> 01:15:30.320]   last year, I discovered I didn't really want a 12.9 inch device.
[01:15:30.320 --> 01:15:33.200]   I wanted something that was smaller, just because it's so much easier to
[01:15:33.200 --> 01:15:37.520]   go into tablet mode, which doesn't really work so well with something that's larger.
[01:15:37.520 --> 01:15:39.600]   That's a that's actually a good point.
[01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:42.720]   You're at a 12.9 when I detach it and pick it up.
[01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:44.000]   It's still like a pizza box.
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:46.160]   I have not missed the extra space at all.
[01:15:46.160 --> 01:15:49.360]   And I use this a lot more for reading than I use my larger one.
[01:15:49.360 --> 01:15:53.360]   I want to try it for doing photo processing because I think it is kind of natural.
[01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:58.000]   If you have a really good reference screen, and by the way, that's they're both P3.
[01:15:58.000 --> 01:16:00.480]   They're both very good reference screens.
[01:16:00.480 --> 01:16:02.080]   The old screen is not too shabby.
[01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:08.240]   Yeah. And you have enough horsepower to run LumaFusion or some of the there's
[01:16:08.240 --> 01:16:12.240]   some really good photo apps, darkroom, pixel-meter photo.
[01:16:12.240 --> 01:16:15.680]   Point at Marie, but she's she's not here.
[01:16:15.680 --> 01:16:17.600]   She represents the pixel-meter folks.
[01:16:17.600 --> 01:16:21.360]   They make a really there's some really good photo editing software,
[01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:24.880]   even Adobe's own programs now are our native.
[01:16:26.240 --> 01:16:32.720]   I think and with it and I got two terabytes of storage, I think that might be a dedicated photo
[01:16:32.720 --> 01:16:36.960]   processing machine because touch and all that and the speed of it might be perfect for that.
[01:16:36.960 --> 01:16:38.960]   The new Thunderbolt parts are getting for.
[01:16:38.960 --> 01:16:43.680]   I could I try to immediately I attached a Thunderbolt giant Thunderbolt drive on there.
[01:16:43.680 --> 01:16:48.800]   You you are I do find myself frustrated a little bit by Apple's unwillingness to expose the file
[01:16:48.800 --> 01:16:54.400]   system. So I can't for instance plug in a hard drive and drag files off the hard drive.
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:57.040]   You're good on Android. Yeah, like you can't on Android.
[01:16:57.040 --> 01:16:58.080]   It's easy on Android.
[01:16:58.080 --> 01:17:01.040]   Android will mad as a hard drive on most machines.
[01:17:01.040 --> 01:17:05.760]   The initial I have with the files app, which actually does let you do a lot of drag and drop,
[01:17:05.760 --> 01:17:07.840]   is that it's not terribly reliable.
[01:17:07.840 --> 01:17:09.680]   Yeah. It just does not work. Right.
[01:17:09.680 --> 01:17:12.320]   Yeah, I was able to see it in the files.
[01:17:12.320 --> 01:17:19.200]   Things so you're saying I could somehow highlight photos and drag them over to the LumaFusion icon.
[01:17:19.200 --> 01:17:20.560]   I don't think I can't do that.
[01:17:20.560 --> 01:17:21.120]   You can't do that.
[01:17:21.120 --> 01:17:21.760]   But you can.
[01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:23.120]   So you could on a desktop.
[01:17:23.920 --> 01:17:28.800]   I think you could get them off of your hard drive on into something into your two terabytes.
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:30.000]   Right. Right.
[01:17:30.000 --> 01:17:34.080]   Although a lot of that stuff people are not aware they can do just because it's
[01:17:34.080 --> 01:17:39.760]   there's a lot of stuff involving the power features in iPadOS that if you know about it,
[01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:42.960]   you can do it. And if you don't know about it, you'll never just never find it.
[01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:43.200]   Yeah.
[01:17:43.200 --> 01:17:44.640]   Discoverability.
[01:17:44.640 --> 01:17:46.240]   Also too with like multitasking.
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:49.280]   Once you know how to multitask, it works pretty well.
[01:17:49.280 --> 01:17:51.680]   Every time I slide over from the right, I get Apple news.
[01:17:51.680 --> 01:17:54.560]   The one program I don't want to see, but I'm sure there's a way to fix that.
[01:17:54.560 --> 01:17:58.240]   Yeah, no, for example, you know, it's a pretty.
[01:17:58.240 --> 01:18:02.880]   So I'm hoping that WWDC tomorrow, there'll be some good news on some of those fronts.
[01:18:02.880 --> 01:18:05.920]   Well, that's why I bring this up because we do have a big Apple event tomorrow.
[01:18:05.920 --> 01:18:09.680]   I'm going to take a little break and when we come back, we'll talk about that.
[01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:11.440]   There's still lots more to talk about our panel.
[01:18:11.440 --> 01:18:14.880]   It's so great. I just love having everybody in studio.
[01:18:14.880 --> 01:18:18.800]   Oh, that flow Florence Ion from all about Android gizmodo.com.
[01:18:19.360 --> 01:18:22.400]   Really nice to have you who's watching Mona.
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:23.680]   My husband, her dad.
[01:18:23.680 --> 01:18:25.600]   My husband, her dad.
[01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:26.320]   Yeah.
[01:18:26.320 --> 01:18:26.720]   Yeah.
[01:18:26.720 --> 01:18:28.720]   The your his her baby daddy.
[01:18:28.720 --> 01:18:28.960]   Yeah.
[01:18:28.960 --> 01:18:29.760]   Your baby daddy.
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:29.760]   Yeah.
[01:18:29.760 --> 01:18:30.240]   Yeah.
[01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:30.240]   Yeah.
[01:18:30.240 --> 01:18:32.960]   And he doesn't mind. He likes it.
[01:18:32.960 --> 01:18:35.040]   He likes the he loves her.
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:35.280]   Yeah.
[01:18:35.280 --> 01:18:36.560]   Or two peas in a pod.
[01:18:36.560 --> 01:18:38.000]   They're also both air signs.
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.040]   So they get along very well.
[01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:40.480]   My daughter was here.
[01:18:40.480 --> 01:18:42.880]   She's taking a master's class and she needed the bandwidth.
[01:18:42.880 --> 01:18:43.840]   She was here earlier today.
[01:18:43.840 --> 01:18:44.960]   I don't know if you ran into her.
[01:18:44.960 --> 01:18:46.560]   She's 29 and I still feel the same.
[01:18:46.560 --> 01:18:47.600]   Oh, I think he's sorry.
[01:18:47.600 --> 01:18:48.800]   She was a little baby.
[01:18:48.800 --> 01:18:50.160]   So it's true.
[01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:52.240]   You know, that connection doesn't go away.
[01:18:52.240 --> 01:18:52.560]   Yeah.
[01:18:52.560 --> 01:18:53.520]   It's awesome.
[01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:54.160]   It's lovely to see.
[01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:54.560]   Yeah.
[01:18:54.560 --> 01:18:55.120]   Yeah.
[01:18:55.120 --> 01:18:57.440]   Harry McCracken also here the technologizer.
[01:18:57.440 --> 01:18:58.800]   Wonderful to have you.
[01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:01.200]   Technology editor at Fast Company.
[01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:03.920]   Best articles ever.
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:05.280]   I love it that they give you.
[01:19:05.280 --> 01:19:06.240]   Are they all long?
[01:19:06.240 --> 01:19:07.600]   I mean, they give you a lot of long form.
[01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:08.640]   A lot of them are.
[01:19:08.640 --> 01:19:10.720]   Every once in a while I try to write shorter
[01:19:10.720 --> 01:19:12.880]   just because it can be a little bit easier.
[01:19:12.880 --> 01:19:16.320]   But I have a good gig because I basically decide what to write
[01:19:16.320 --> 01:19:17.920]   and write it whatever along.
[01:19:17.920 --> 01:19:21.120]   For a while I thought your title was Harry McCracken long read.
[01:19:21.120 --> 01:19:24.880]   But that's just something they put on the longer articles to let you know.
[01:19:24.880 --> 01:19:29.600]   If you added that my recent stories, you'd see I've been doing some that are not quite a long.
[01:19:29.600 --> 01:19:29.920]   Oh, yeah.
[01:19:29.920 --> 01:19:32.160]   Lift Better E-bike for urban sharing.
[01:19:32.160 --> 01:19:33.600]   Your article on the iPad.
[01:19:33.600 --> 01:19:34.640]   Google Maps.
[01:19:34.640 --> 01:19:34.960]   Google Maps.
[01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:35.440]   Yeah.
[01:19:35.440 --> 01:19:37.120]   But then I love the history stuff.
[01:19:37.120 --> 01:19:38.800]   I can't wait to read this.
[01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:43.440]   How a 1981 conference kick started today's quantum computing era.
[01:19:43.440 --> 01:19:46.640]   I talked to somebody who's been at IBM working on quantum stuff
[01:19:46.640 --> 01:19:48.800]   since 1972.
[01:19:48.800 --> 01:19:49.040]   Dang.
[01:19:49.040 --> 01:19:50.160]   What?
[01:19:50.160 --> 01:19:52.880]   So I am of mixed opinions.
[01:19:52.880 --> 01:19:55.920]   I feel like quantum computing is very speculative.
[01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:57.360]   They are making progress.
[01:19:57.360 --> 01:20:01.520]   But not to the point where you could say, oh, this is going to be a hot new technology
[01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:02.640]   in the next 10 years.
[01:20:02.640 --> 01:20:06.960]   I think a lot of the research being done as being government funded,
[01:20:06.960 --> 01:20:10.160]   they're just it's a chance to get a little money from the feds.
[01:20:10.160 --> 01:20:14.480]   What do you think after talking to people like Charlie Bennett,
[01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:18.720]   do you feel like we're going to get their quantum computing as the next big breakthrough?
[01:20:18.720 --> 01:20:21.760]   And there's still, I mean, there's also disagreement among the companies doing
[01:20:21.760 --> 01:20:28.800]   not some of who basically say it's here now and some of who say it's maybe not decades off.
[01:20:28.800 --> 01:20:30.320]   IBM seems to think it's here.
[01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:32.880]   Selling a commercial quantum computer.
[01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:33.040]   They are.
[01:20:33.040 --> 01:20:37.360]   Although the stuff they're selling right now is for basically for companies who want to get their feet wet.
[01:20:37.360 --> 01:20:38.320]   Yeah.
[01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:40.560]   You're not going to actually do any work with it.
[01:20:40.560 --> 01:20:42.720]   They actually published some road maps.
[01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:45.040]   They published a hardware roadmap and a software roadmap.
[01:20:45.040 --> 01:20:51.840]   Basically, they say that we're now like it's within like a very few years.
[01:20:51.840 --> 01:20:57.760]   They'll have enough qubits that quantum computers will be able to do stuff that's actually useful
[01:20:57.760 --> 01:21:00.080]   and which a classical computer can't do.
[01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:03.120]   The qubit is like the bit the unit.
[01:21:03.120 --> 01:21:04.960]   The fundamental building.
[01:21:04.960 --> 01:21:05.360]   The fundamental unit.
[01:21:05.360 --> 01:21:06.960]   They're about 50 right now.
[01:21:06.960 --> 01:21:08.560]   How many do you have to be to be useful?
[01:21:08.560 --> 01:21:12.240]   They're talking about having a thousand and once you have a thousand,
[01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:14.240]   inherently, as you can do stuff that's transformative.
[01:21:14.240 --> 01:21:14.800]   That's critical mass.
[01:21:14.800 --> 01:21:15.040]   Yeah.
[01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:23.520]   Of course, Google at Google I/O showed off their beautiful quantum AI lab, which looked pretty.
[01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:28.960]   You know, it looked flashy.
[01:21:28.960 --> 01:21:31.680]   I don't know if it meant that anything exciting was going to happen.
[01:21:31.680 --> 01:21:35.600]   They said 2029, I think, for their quantum computer.
[01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:40.080]   That seems, I mean, 10 years, but everything's 10 years off, right?
[01:21:40.080 --> 01:21:42.400]   Flying cars are 10 years off, right?
[01:21:42.400 --> 01:21:47.040]   I mean, they have made a ton of progress until like 10 years ago.
[01:21:47.040 --> 01:21:49.440]   It was pretty much totally speculative.
[01:21:49.440 --> 01:21:53.680]   And they've gotten pretty far in that time.
[01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:56.080]   But this conference was 1981.
[01:21:56.080 --> 01:21:58.560]   So like 40 years ago.
[01:21:58.560 --> 01:22:02.400]   And that was sort of when they first said, hey, maybe we should build a quantum computer.
[01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:09.040]   And it might be possible. And then they spent like 20 years thinking about it and making
[01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:14.320]   slow progress. And about 10 years ago, IBM said, we think we can do this.
[01:22:14.320 --> 01:22:17.120]   And it might actually be a large business for us someday.
[01:22:17.120 --> 01:22:19.600]   And then they started to invest more into it.
[01:22:19.600 --> 01:22:27.440]   And you saw Google and Microsoft and a bunch of startups and companies like Honeywell all doing
[01:22:27.440 --> 01:22:27.920]   stuff.
[01:22:27.920 --> 01:22:28.400]   Right.
[01:22:28.400 --> 01:22:30.480]   Yeah, Honeywell's saying they're going to sell them.
[01:22:30.480 --> 01:22:30.800]   I know.
[01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:31.440]   Isn't that funny?
[01:22:32.160 --> 01:22:38.080]   Is it possible that that's just one of a number of paths that forward, for instance, photonics?
[01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:42.720]   Yeah, we're coming to the end of Moore's Law.
[01:22:42.720 --> 01:22:49.280]   Although, God, now we're down to three nanometer processors, or equivalent three nanometer processors.
[01:22:49.280 --> 01:22:54.000]   But Moore's Law is really kind of a barrier at some point in the future.
[01:22:54.000 --> 01:22:58.880]   That other technologies besides quantum might be the great leap forward.
[01:22:58.880 --> 01:23:00.160]   Is that possible, do you think?
[01:23:00.160 --> 01:23:05.200]   It could be. Although, you know, quantum is not going to replace classical computers.
[01:23:05.200 --> 01:23:06.480]   It's going to work alongside it.
[01:23:06.480 --> 01:23:07.200]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:12.640]   There's going to be a ton of stuff for which a supercomputer still makes sense.
[01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:15.840]   And stuff like creating a user interface.
[01:23:15.840 --> 01:23:18.960]   The computers we have now are fine.
[01:23:18.960 --> 01:23:23.520]   So I don't think you want to build your UIs with quantum technology.
[01:23:23.520 --> 01:23:24.880]   You have a classical interface.
[01:23:24.880 --> 01:23:27.120]   And you have the quantum computers do things.
[01:23:27.120 --> 01:23:28.000]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:30.080]   But classical computers can't have to.
[01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:30.640]   So you can divvy up.
[01:23:30.640 --> 01:23:36.000]   Of course, the great fear with quantum computing is that it will break the fundamental
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:37.360]   cryptography algorithms.
[01:23:37.360 --> 01:23:38.880]   Yeah, and it pretty much will.
[01:23:38.880 --> 01:23:42.560]   And so they're working on new improved encryption technologies.
[01:23:42.560 --> 01:23:48.240]   Which is one reason I think why IBM is trying to get people thinking about it and experimenting
[01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:49.040]   with it now.
[01:23:49.040 --> 01:23:51.920]   It's also good for IBM because they're the ones that announced the three nanometer
[01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:53.360]   processors as well.
[01:23:53.360 --> 01:23:57.040]   They're looking very like, oh, IBM's still in the business.
[01:23:57.040 --> 01:23:57.760]   Yeah.
[01:23:57.760 --> 01:24:02.240]   And if they thought quantum was the next thing, they would not be investing in...
[01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:04.000]   That's a good point.
[01:24:04.000 --> 01:24:04.720]   Very good point.
[01:24:04.720 --> 01:24:10.320]   Also with us, the great Roberto Baldwin, you drive a new car every week.
[01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:11.520]   What are you driving this week?
[01:24:11.520 --> 01:24:12.480]   I'm not driving it.
[01:24:12.480 --> 01:24:14.800]   It's funny because this is the week I don't have a car.
[01:24:14.800 --> 01:24:16.000]   At all.
[01:24:16.000 --> 01:24:17.600]   Oh, I have my car.
[01:24:17.600 --> 01:24:19.120]   Oh, oh, you actually own a car.
[01:24:19.120 --> 01:24:20.160]   Yeah, we own a couple of cars.
[01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:21.040]   What's your next car?
[01:24:21.040 --> 01:24:25.040]   The next car I'll be driving that I can't talk about.
[01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:28.240]   But I know I can say that I'm going to be driving it is the brand new S-Class.
[01:24:28.240 --> 01:24:30.080]   From Mercedes?
[01:24:30.080 --> 01:24:32.880]   Oh, we have a Mercedes love up here.
[01:24:32.880 --> 01:24:36.640]   Yeah, so the new S-Class, I'll be driving it this week sometimes.
[01:24:36.640 --> 01:24:37.280]   And then after that...
[01:24:37.280 --> 01:24:38.720]   Is that their top of the line luxury class?
[01:24:38.720 --> 01:24:39.760]   Yeah, that's the top of the...
[01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:40.800]   That's the most class.
[01:24:40.800 --> 01:24:42.240]   That's the one with all the...
[01:24:42.240 --> 01:24:42.640]   Look at it.
[01:24:42.640 --> 01:24:43.120]   Look at it.
[01:24:43.120 --> 01:24:43.920]   It's like...
[01:24:43.920 --> 01:24:44.400]   Yes.
[01:24:44.400 --> 01:24:46.480]   Yes, it looks like the interior is like Vegas.
[01:24:46.480 --> 01:24:46.960]   Have you...
[01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:47.520]   Have you...
[01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:49.360]   I've saddened it before I've been driven it.
[01:24:49.360 --> 01:24:50.960]   The interior is like Las Vegas.
[01:24:50.960 --> 01:24:53.280]   We're saving a foot up on this luxury.
[01:24:53.280 --> 01:24:55.680]   They put up a tweet or something.
[01:24:55.680 --> 01:24:55.920]   I don't know.
[01:24:55.920 --> 01:24:57.520]   They put up a post with a photo.
[01:24:57.520 --> 01:25:00.000]   And it was just like all these lights and people are like,
[01:25:00.000 --> 01:25:00.720]   What is this?
[01:25:00.720 --> 01:25:05.120]   It's a luxury, but they're trying to go for the millennials who are...
[01:25:05.120 --> 01:25:07.360]   Do you aspire to an S-Class Mercedes?
[01:25:07.360 --> 01:25:08.400]   Is that your goal in life?
[01:25:08.400 --> 01:25:12.320]   No, I have a C-Class, but my plan is to get...
[01:25:12.320 --> 01:25:17.200]   I'm thinking about maybe an older E-Class.
[01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:17.760]   I want it like...
[01:25:17.760 --> 01:25:18.640]   I would love an old...
[01:25:18.640 --> 01:25:20.080]   I want it like blacked out.
[01:25:20.080 --> 01:25:20.880]   I want it matte.
[01:25:20.880 --> 01:25:21.840]   I want to be like...
[01:25:21.840 --> 01:25:22.880]   I want to look like a mob.
[01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:25.680]   When I drop off Moana in school, that's my plan.
[01:25:25.680 --> 01:25:27.280]   Or it's I on mob wife.
[01:25:27.280 --> 01:25:28.240]   That's a good plan.
[01:25:28.240 --> 01:25:29.440]   I like that plan a lot.
[01:25:29.440 --> 01:25:30.160]   Yeah.
[01:25:30.160 --> 01:25:31.120]   I like that plan better than...
[01:25:31.120 --> 01:25:34.240]   But we did buy a family car because you now have to.
[01:25:34.240 --> 01:25:36.080]   What family car do you get so I can judge you?
[01:25:36.080 --> 01:25:39.280]   We ended up getting a Subaru Outback.
[01:25:39.280 --> 01:25:40.160]   Oh cool.
[01:25:40.160 --> 01:25:40.880]   That's a good car.
[01:25:40.880 --> 01:25:42.160]   Yeah, that's a Subaru car.
[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:43.760]   It's very comfy.
[01:25:43.760 --> 01:25:44.240]   Yeah.
[01:25:44.240 --> 01:25:45.040]   Bulletproof.
[01:25:45.040 --> 01:25:47.760]   It's a room in the back to hang out with Moana and like...
[01:25:47.760 --> 01:25:49.200]   CBT is kind of a pain in the butt, but...
[01:25:49.200 --> 01:25:50.560]   My son is a Subi guy.
[01:25:50.560 --> 01:25:51.440]   He loves those.
[01:25:51.440 --> 01:25:52.080]   Yeah.
[01:25:52.080 --> 01:25:53.360]   It yells at you a lot though.
[01:25:53.360 --> 01:25:54.000]   These cars...
[01:25:54.000 --> 01:25:54.880]   These modern cars.
[01:25:54.880 --> 01:25:55.920]   Oh, you're taking a drink of water.
[01:25:55.920 --> 01:25:56.640]   Boop, boop, boop, boop.
[01:25:56.640 --> 01:25:57.120]   Look at the road.
[01:25:57.120 --> 01:25:57.680]   Modern cars.
[01:25:57.680 --> 01:25:58.320]   Modern cars.
[01:25:58.320 --> 01:26:04.560]   No, I like the Subaru as put the distracted driver camera in there.
[01:26:04.560 --> 01:26:06.320]   To tell people to look at what they're doing.
[01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:07.040]   It's constantly yelling at me.
[01:26:07.040 --> 01:26:11.440]   Because people do not look where they're going and it's terrifying.
[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:14.800]   If you drive a motorcycle, you typically sit higher and everyone...
[01:26:14.800 --> 01:26:16.960]   So you see what everyone's doing in their cars.
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:17.840]   And guess what?
[01:26:17.840 --> 01:26:19.120]   Not everyone's driving.
[01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:20.640]   I mean, they're in the car driving.
[01:26:20.640 --> 01:26:21.840]   But they're doing a lot of this.
[01:26:21.840 --> 01:26:22.640]   That's a little scary.
[01:26:22.640 --> 01:26:25.200]   Because when you're commuting every single day,
[01:26:25.200 --> 01:26:27.200]   you get into this autopilot mode.
[01:26:27.200 --> 01:26:31.520]   I mean, even here, I felt my self-get into an autopilot on 37.
[01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:32.000]   That's scary.
[01:26:32.000 --> 01:26:32.320]   Like, stuck.
[01:26:32.320 --> 01:26:36.080]   Oh yeah, well, you forgot that there was a NASCAR race in Finland.
[01:26:36.080 --> 01:26:38.160]   Well, it's always bad there getting on there.
[01:26:38.160 --> 01:26:39.440]   You're not getting ever getting home.
[01:26:39.440 --> 01:26:39.920]   You know that.
[01:26:39.920 --> 01:26:40.240]   Never.
[01:26:40.240 --> 01:26:40.720]   Yeah, I know.
[01:26:40.720 --> 01:26:42.560]   That's why I brought food.
[01:26:42.560 --> 01:26:43.360]   That's what I'm saying.
[01:26:43.360 --> 01:26:45.840]   We should go to I happen Popeyes next.
[01:26:45.840 --> 01:26:47.040]   I happen Popeyes.
[01:26:47.040 --> 01:26:48.080]   Dave, have you seen the...
[01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:48.960]   You probably haven't...
[01:26:48.960 --> 01:26:50.800]   You know what's driven the F-150 Lightning
[01:26:50.800 --> 01:26:52.800]   with the new electric Ford truck?
[01:26:52.800 --> 01:26:54.240]   No, I mean, I've only seen the...
[01:26:54.240 --> 01:26:55.280]   Whatever one else has seen.
[01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:55.280]   Yeah.
[01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:56.400]   They didn't invite me to...
[01:26:56.400 --> 01:26:57.360]   I want that one.
[01:26:57.360 --> 01:26:58.080]   That's the one I want.
[01:26:58.080 --> 01:26:58.400]   It is.
[01:26:58.400 --> 01:27:01.360]   Well, the F-150 is essentially its own company.
[01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:02.480]   It's almost its own country.
[01:27:02.480 --> 01:27:04.720]   It's the most successful car of all time, I think.
[01:27:04.720 --> 01:27:06.080]   Over three decades for the past.
[01:27:06.080 --> 01:27:09.440]   Over three decades, the highest selling vehicle in the United States.
[01:27:09.440 --> 01:27:11.200]   For the past over four decades,
[01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:14.000]   it's been the number one selling truck.
[01:27:14.000 --> 01:27:16.400]   That is insane.
[01:27:16.400 --> 01:27:19.440]   It prints money and the idea that...
[01:27:19.440 --> 01:27:23.600]   And the fact that Ford decided to make an EV out of that car...
[01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:24.080]   Pretty impressive.
[01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:25.680]   Or that vehicle is a big...
[01:27:25.680 --> 01:27:28.160]   Is a huge, huge, huge deal because
[01:27:28.160 --> 01:27:31.440]   you pull in a lot of contractors who don't drive a lot.
[01:27:31.440 --> 01:27:33.040]   You get a lot of fleet sales.
[01:27:33.040 --> 01:27:36.960]   And then you get that F-150 buyer thinking,
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:38.400]   "Well, maybe I can get an EV."
[01:27:38.400 --> 01:27:38.800]   Yeah.
[01:27:38.800 --> 01:27:40.320]   Maybe they can throw their...
[01:27:40.320 --> 01:27:41.440]   It's got plugs in the back, man.
[01:27:41.440 --> 01:27:42.560]   It's got plugs in the back.
[01:27:42.560 --> 01:27:44.080]   It's got a front plug things in.
[01:27:44.080 --> 01:27:45.680]   I'm never gonna get cold again.
[01:27:45.680 --> 01:27:46.640]   That front is...
[01:27:46.640 --> 01:27:47.840]   You can put two floors in the front.
[01:27:47.840 --> 01:27:49.680]   You can put a Model Y.
[01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:51.920]   You can put two floors in the front.
[01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:52.560]   Yeah.
[01:27:52.560 --> 01:27:54.160]   That's how big the front is.
[01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:54.960]   Yeah.
[01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:55.520]   No, it's...
[01:27:55.520 --> 01:27:57.920]   So I haven't driven the F-150, unfortunately.
[01:27:57.920 --> 01:27:58.320]   I don't think...
[01:27:58.320 --> 01:28:00.400]   No, Joe Biden drove it.
[01:28:00.400 --> 01:28:01.360]   Joe Biden was the only one.
[01:28:01.360 --> 01:28:01.920]   I bet he doesn't.
[01:28:01.920 --> 01:28:03.520]   I don't know who he writes for.
[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:04.080]   Or he's four.
[01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:04.640]   Yeah, I know.
[01:28:04.640 --> 01:28:06.320]   Who's he when he's at home?
[01:28:06.320 --> 01:28:09.680]   Great to have all three of you.
[01:28:09.680 --> 01:28:10.640]   Thank you.
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:12.240]   We had a fun week this week on Twitter.
[01:28:12.240 --> 01:28:13.040]   I think we have...
[01:28:13.040 --> 01:28:13.520]   Do we have...
[01:28:13.520 --> 01:28:17.360]   We have a little mini movie to dramatize the excitement.
[01:28:17.360 --> 01:28:18.480]   Here you go, watch.
[01:28:18.480 --> 01:28:24.160]   Amazon's experimental wireless mesh networking turns users into guinea pigs.
[01:28:24.160 --> 01:28:26.800]   They are upset about this for all the wrong reasons.
[01:28:26.800 --> 01:28:29.520]   I will give you three reasons you can be upset.
[01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:31.280]   Previously on Twitter.
[01:28:31.280 --> 01:28:32.800]   Right, security now.
[01:28:32.800 --> 01:28:39.520]   The design is clearly intended to absolutely prevent any possible abuse of the system.
[01:28:39.520 --> 01:28:42.880]   Even Amazon can't see into it the way it's designed.
[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:44.000]   iOS today.
[01:28:44.000 --> 01:28:47.920]   Apple has announced finalists for the Apple Design Awards.
[01:28:47.920 --> 01:28:52.640]   You take a picture of a doodle and then the app brings it to life.
[01:28:52.640 --> 01:28:53.440]   What?
[01:28:53.440 --> 01:28:54.960]   Thomas is coming to life.
[01:28:54.960 --> 01:28:56.160]   Hands on tech.
[01:28:56.160 --> 01:28:59.840]   Google Photos free cloud storage is no more.
[01:28:59.840 --> 01:29:04.480]   And you might be thinking, well, what if I wanted to host my photos on my own photo cloud?
[01:29:04.480 --> 01:29:05.440]   Floss Weekly.
[01:29:05.440 --> 01:29:09.840]   Our guest today is Ryan Fox, the creator of the Bash Shell.
[01:29:09.840 --> 01:29:16.800]   Nobody in the planet cares what technology, whether it was open source or not, that was
[01:29:16.800 --> 01:29:19.840]   used to build the software in your microwave.
[01:29:19.840 --> 01:29:21.360]   Nobody thinks about that.
[01:29:21.360 --> 01:29:25.200]   So why would you make that software suddenly be secret and proprietary?
[01:29:25.200 --> 01:29:25.840]   To it.
[01:29:25.840 --> 01:29:28.720]   Learn something new every day and what it means.
[01:29:28.720 --> 01:29:31.760]   The most exciting thing for me is when I see all the places it gets used.
[01:29:31.760 --> 01:29:35.600]   And this friend says, you know it runs the nuclear power plants here in the US.
[01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:38.160]   No, that's terrifying.
[01:29:38.160 --> 01:29:39.920]   And I was not aware of that.
[01:29:39.920 --> 01:29:41.440]   I use it.
[01:29:41.440 --> 01:29:42.480]   The creator of Bash.
[01:29:42.480 --> 01:29:43.920]   That's pretty awesome, Brian Fox.
[01:29:43.920 --> 01:29:46.400]   You got to watch that Floss Weekly episode.
[01:29:46.400 --> 01:29:50.000]   Our show today brought to you by ExpressVPN.
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:52.240]   You know there are a lot of VPN providers out there.
[01:29:52.240 --> 01:29:56.080]   VPN is practically a generic idea.
[01:29:56.080 --> 01:29:57.680]   It's even built in the Linux these days.
[01:29:57.680 --> 01:30:04.160]   But there's something really important that you should consider before you choose your VPN
[01:30:04.160 --> 01:30:04.800]   provider.
[01:30:05.600 --> 01:30:06.720]   Privacy.
[01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:10.880]   Because you may be using a VPN for security so that people can't see what you're doing
[01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:16.400]   on the internet for privacy so that your ISP or carrier can't log it and sell it to marketers.
[01:30:16.400 --> 01:30:22.480]   But in effect, you're just passing that responsibility onto the VPN provider.
[01:30:22.480 --> 01:30:27.440]   And I got to tell you, there are lots of VPN providers that do worse things than the ISPs.
[01:30:27.440 --> 01:30:35.280]   There's VPN providers actually inject ads onto websites that are their ads, not the website's ads.
[01:30:35.280 --> 01:30:38.080]   That's why I recommend ExpressVPN.
[01:30:38.080 --> 01:30:41.520]   ExpressVPN cares so much about not logging.
[01:30:41.520 --> 01:30:48.320]   They actually invented a technology they call a trusted server that makes it impossible for them
[01:30:48.320 --> 01:30:49.920]   to log any of your info.
[01:30:49.920 --> 01:30:55.760]   And by the way, it's been audited by a trusted third party, a price water house scooper.
[01:30:55.760 --> 01:31:01.680]   So you can you can be sure that it and they said the trusted server does exactly what it says it does.
[01:31:01.680 --> 01:31:04.960]   The idea is when you press that big button on your ExpressVPN app,
[01:31:04.960 --> 01:31:10.480]   by the way, easiest app in the world, iOS, Android, Windows, Mac, everywhere, even on TVs,
[01:31:10.480 --> 01:31:13.200]   you can get ExpressVPN for your router.
[01:31:13.200 --> 01:31:15.760]   When you press that big button, you turn on ExpressVPN.
[01:31:15.760 --> 01:31:22.000]   It spins up the server into RAM, never existed until you press that button into RAM,
[01:31:22.000 --> 01:31:23.920]   runs on the machine, you're running through it.
[01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:26.560]   That server is sandboxed, cannot write to hard drive.
[01:31:26.560 --> 01:31:29.840]   And then when you turn off ExpressVPN, it's gone.
[01:31:29.840 --> 01:31:30.960]   It was running in RAM.
[01:31:30.960 --> 01:31:34.720]   No trace exists of your visit.
[01:31:34.720 --> 01:31:35.920]   That's what you want.
[01:31:35.920 --> 01:31:40.400]   The other reason it's important to choose a VPN, the right VPN is speed.
[01:31:40.400 --> 01:31:44.240]   You want a VPN provider that invests in their network to make sure there's plenty of bandwidth.
[01:31:44.240 --> 01:31:48.800]   I think a lot of people think, oh, I'm not going to use a VPN because it slows me down.
[01:31:48.800 --> 01:31:49.280]   It's true.
[01:31:49.280 --> 01:31:55.840]   On other guys, a lot of VPNs, you feel sluggish because they're just not investing in infrastructure.
[01:31:55.840 --> 01:32:02.560]   ExpressVPN does high priority for them that you can stream HD quality video through ExpressVPN
[01:32:02.560 --> 01:32:07.360]   with zero lag. And I can guarantee you, you can because I can use ExpressVPN to log into London,
[01:32:07.360 --> 01:32:12.000]   to watch Netflix UK or Japan to watch Netflix, Japan as an example.
[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:13.440]   And I can watch HD video.
[01:32:13.440 --> 01:32:17.600]   I'm not just saying that, even though I've been using them for years, that's how fast it is.
[01:32:17.600 --> 01:32:22.000]   So fast that in many houses, you just turn it on and leave it on.
[01:32:22.000 --> 01:32:25.680]   You just put it on the router, turn it on, you're protected all the time.
[01:32:25.680 --> 01:32:27.680]   No one's going to complain. You won't even know.
[01:32:27.680 --> 01:32:32.320]   The other thing that sets ExpressVPN apart from other VPNs is just that it's so easy to
[01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:35.120]   use. Fire up the app, push the button.
[01:32:35.120 --> 01:32:37.440]   Anybody can use it.
[01:32:37.440 --> 01:32:42.400]   Even those people in your family who don't know what a VPN is, they just know they want to be
[01:32:42.400 --> 01:32:46.400]   private. You can put it on their phones and they'll use it, leave it on. They'll never
[01:32:46.400 --> 01:32:49.120]   complain and they'll be very, very happy that they're protected.
[01:32:49.120 --> 01:32:54.160]   It's not just me that loves ExpressVPN, wired the Verge, CNET. Pretty much everyone agrees.
[01:32:54.160 --> 01:33:00.720]   ExpressVPN is the number one VPN in the world because it's the best. Protect yourself with the
[01:33:00.720 --> 01:33:04.960]   only VPN I use, the one I trust, ExpressVPN.com/twit.
[01:33:04.960 --> 01:33:08.640]   We've got a great deal for you when you buy a one-year package, you get an extra three months free.
[01:33:08.640 --> 01:33:18.320]   ExpressVPN.com/twit, expressvpn.com/twit. Tell you what's not hard using ExpressVPN.
[01:33:18.320 --> 01:33:22.000]   You're going to love it. ExpressVPN. Thank you for your support.
[01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:28.080]   This week in tech, tomorrow, I will be coming in on my day off. We're excited.
[01:33:29.040 --> 01:33:34.880]   It's a WWDC, the World Wide Developers Conference. Apple always takes advantage of WWDC. It's funny
[01:33:34.880 --> 01:33:40.000]   because there have been two recently two developers conferences, Microsoft's Build,
[01:33:40.000 --> 01:33:46.160]   Google I/O. Neither of them, you have a chance with the keynote. We streamed it. We covered it.
[01:33:46.160 --> 01:33:50.960]   A lot of press, a lot of public watching it to announce something. Neither have had anything
[01:33:50.960 --> 01:33:58.720]   worth. You could talk to Pluto. Big deal. You can't do it anyway. It's in the research.
[01:33:58.720 --> 01:34:04.160]   So no Pixel 6, which I was a little disappointed. I thought that maybe announce a new Chromebook,
[01:34:04.160 --> 01:34:10.480]   something Microsoft even less. Although they had a big announcement later, which we'll talk about
[01:34:10.480 --> 01:34:18.080]   in a bit, I think Apple though will announce new hardware. In fact, it was leaked by a ransomware
[01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:24.880]   group, our evil that hacked Quanta, which is one of the suppliers Apple uses to build laptops.
[01:34:25.920 --> 01:34:30.480]   As most ransomware groups do now, not only do they encrypt the data, they also, before they
[01:34:30.480 --> 01:34:36.800]   encrypted, it stole it. They told Apple and Quanta, "If you don't want to see the stuff you're
[01:34:36.800 --> 01:34:41.840]   going to announce, you'll pay as $50 million." They did, as a proof of concept release,
[01:34:41.840 --> 01:34:48.320]   schematics for two new laptops, a 14 and a 16-inch laptop, which is what I think Apple's going
[01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:53.280]   to announce tomorrow. Then they got very quiet. I don't know if somebody paid them or what,
[01:34:53.920 --> 01:34:57.760]   where the SEAL Team 6 took them out. They were found.
[01:34:57.760 --> 01:35:02.560]   No, no, no, they got a pretty good-- Apple's security is no joke. I don't think they would pay
[01:35:02.560 --> 01:35:08.960]   $50 million to a ransomware game. I know. They would never give in. They'd be like, "Oh, no."
[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:13.360]   They have their own mission-impossible team, I think. I was just going to say, it's literally Tom
[01:35:13.360 --> 01:35:20.480]   Cruz. That's really-- He just running and then falling from skies and running and then
[01:35:21.280 --> 01:35:28.320]   then he tears off his mask. It's Tim Cook. That happened. I forgot all about that.
[01:35:28.320 --> 01:35:30.400]   That's why Tim Cook is so jacked.
[01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:35.200]   They're also going to use a lot of stuff. He's always a clean scoop anyway over the last few years.
[01:35:35.200 --> 01:35:39.600]   Oh, ransomware, me. I don't think they like the scoops. They really like the surprise.
[01:35:39.600 --> 01:35:45.680]   Apple's pretty good at keeping their own people quiet, but the suppliers are--
[01:35:45.680 --> 01:35:48.480]   They're going to keep them so quiet. You have to go to work three days a week.
[01:35:48.480 --> 01:35:52.720]   That's how quiet they're going to keep you. Watching you.
[01:35:52.720 --> 01:35:57.520]   It's on you. The cool thing about WWDC is it's primarily software and software is
[01:35:57.520 --> 01:36:02.960]   easier to keep secret than hardware. That's true. It's more likely that there'll be some
[01:36:02.960 --> 01:36:08.160]   surprises. We know there'll be iOS 15. We know there'll be Mac OS 12, perhaps, or whatever they're
[01:36:08.160 --> 01:36:13.920]   going to call it next. They always do that at WWDC. There may be some-- It sounds like you
[01:36:13.920 --> 01:36:19.200]   think there's going to be some surprises in this. Well, just because relatively little has leaked
[01:36:19.200 --> 01:36:24.400]   compared to the more hardware-centric events, sometimes when there's a new iPhone,
[01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:29.360]   it seems like most of the details are out there. With the OS upgrades, yes, you know they're going
[01:36:29.360 --> 01:36:36.880]   to announce them. Most of the stuff I've heard out there is fairly obvious stuff, such as maybe
[01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:42.240]   iPads will get the same kind of widget support that the iPhone got last year.
[01:36:42.240 --> 01:36:48.480]   That'd be interesting. You and I, both as iPad users, would be loved to see iPadOS get a little bit
[01:36:48.480 --> 01:36:50.640]   more professional perhaps. Wow. Goodbye, Andrew.
[01:36:50.640 --> 01:36:56.960]   You know, it's funny. You notice I had the Pixel 4, which is now falling apart. I've had it so long.
[01:36:56.960 --> 01:37:05.120]   Physically falling apart. I really loved Pixel phones. Google-- I was hoping for Pixel 6.
[01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:10.400]   Google has done nothing to woo me over, and I have to say iOS, I'm pretty happy with it.
[01:37:10.400 --> 01:37:14.160]   And I feel like it's probably more private, more secure. It's interesting. Google has announced
[01:37:14.160 --> 01:37:18.800]   that in Android 12, you had a story on this. They're going to do the same thing Apple did with iOS
[01:37:18.800 --> 01:37:23.040]   14, where you get to say, "No, don't track me." I think that's really interesting.
[01:37:23.040 --> 01:37:26.960]   Yeah, but don't track me third parties. Google's still tracking you.
[01:37:26.960 --> 01:37:31.920]   Google's still tracking you, baby. So that's the really important thing that I think
[01:37:31.920 --> 01:37:36.320]   people have finally figured out is all these companies are doing is saying no third party
[01:37:36.320 --> 01:37:42.080]   tracking, but first party tracking has never ended. Facebook, Google, and yes, Apple
[01:37:42.080 --> 01:37:46.800]   know everything about you. What Apple will do with it, we don't know. I think they're considering
[01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:49.760]   starting an ad network. They're starting to put ads on their app store.
[01:37:49.760 --> 01:37:54.080]   Wow. For their own devices? No, they're selling them.
[01:37:54.080 --> 01:37:59.920]   Yeah. They're going content. That's why everybody's trying to copy them now, just saying.
[01:37:59.920 --> 01:38:04.960]   I think Apple right now has the lock. You got to admit it. Because they jumped on it.
[01:38:04.960 --> 01:38:13.360]   They're dominant for everything. New laptops within a new M2 or M1X processor.
[01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:16.640]   Well, I think they're going to go to the next generation.
[01:38:16.640 --> 01:38:20.400]   The rumor is a 16-inch-- Oh, it might have an M1.
[01:38:20.400 --> 01:38:23.520]   You got an error. Is that an M1 error? Yes, an M1 error.
[01:38:23.520 --> 01:38:26.960]   That's fine. The M1 error is the same as the M1 Mini as the M1 Pro.
[01:38:26.960 --> 01:38:30.320]   I wanted a DSD card slot. I was holding it out. I was holding it out.
[01:38:30.320 --> 01:38:34.800]   I quit my job. I went freelance. I was using a 2015 MacBook Air, which by the way,
[01:38:34.800 --> 01:38:38.480]   the keyboard is amazing on a 2015 MacBook Air. It's the best. It's the best keyboard.
[01:38:38.480 --> 01:38:42.880]   We kept it. I used them for DJing. It did not like Lightroom.
[01:38:42.880 --> 01:38:48.240]   I was trying to do raw stuff with Lightroom, and it was pretty old.
[01:38:48.240 --> 01:38:51.520]   Oh, no. But the M1's first thing I booked was a photography gig.
[01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:54.480]   Yeah, it was amazing. Yeah. I just plugged things in.
[01:38:54.480 --> 01:38:57.440]   So there is a rumor that they'll do the next generation of processor.
[01:38:57.440 --> 01:39:01.600]   They booked up all of TSMC's production for the next 20 years, practically.
[01:39:02.400 --> 01:39:06.720]   It might be something that does look more genuinely new in the way that the new iMac
[01:39:06.720 --> 01:39:09.600]   design from a few weeks ago was a genuinely new iMac.
[01:39:09.600 --> 01:39:15.600]   You have not really seen much in the way of genuinely new Mac portable designs and years.
[01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:17.600]   Yeah. SD card slots and some of them.
[01:39:17.600 --> 01:39:18.480]   Apple MacBooks.
[01:39:18.480 --> 01:39:20.080]   Oh, color would be nice.
[01:39:20.080 --> 01:39:23.040]   Oh, if I could have got an orange MacBook Air.
[01:39:23.040 --> 01:39:24.160]   The orange one is beautiful.
[01:39:24.160 --> 01:39:30.080]   It looks so... I'm a little jelly. I want that. I want that in my life.
[01:39:30.080 --> 01:39:34.400]   We'll be watching with interest. I'll be in here at 10 a.m. tomorrow with Michael Sargent.
[01:39:34.400 --> 01:39:42.400]   We were thinking about doing the afternoon developers keynote.
[01:39:42.400 --> 01:39:43.920]   They do a state of the union.
[01:39:43.920 --> 01:39:47.040]   In the past, when Apple had light events, they'd kicked the journalists out.
[01:39:47.040 --> 01:39:48.080]   Remember that, Eric Krasz.
[01:39:48.080 --> 01:39:51.680]   Eric, we'd be there for the keynote, and then they'd say,
[01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:54.000]   "Okay, leave, because we're going to talk about good stuff now."
[01:39:54.000 --> 01:39:54.560]   Yes.
[01:39:54.560 --> 01:39:55.120]   That's going...
[01:39:55.120 --> 01:39:56.960]   That's so different than Google.
[01:39:56.960 --> 01:40:01.360]   Google's like, "Yeah, come in. Sit in the sessions. Get to the developers."
[01:40:01.360 --> 01:40:05.040]   I have to admit, I lost my nerve. We were thinking of streaming the developer keynote,
[01:40:05.040 --> 01:40:07.600]   but then I realized Apple's not going to like that too much.
[01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:09.360]   They don't like it that we stream any of their keynotes.
[01:40:09.360 --> 01:40:15.680]   Jason Snell at Mac, where they would buy tickets to WWDC for several thousand dollars,
[01:40:15.680 --> 01:40:17.520]   which was the one way you could get in for the whole thing.
[01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:20.000]   Right. But then you can't write about it, because you're...
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:21.920]   Yep, you're under NDA.
[01:40:21.920 --> 01:40:28.960]   Remember the NDA? If you sign the NDA, you have to say, talking about the NDA was in violation of the NDA.
[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:33.680]   So whenever a journalist would complain about another...
[01:40:33.680 --> 01:40:37.440]   It was usually Gizmodo. Gizmodo would break the NDA and write about something.
[01:40:37.440 --> 01:40:42.800]   They would complain about it, but then I'm like, "Well, you complaining about it is also violating the NDA."
[01:40:42.800 --> 01:40:48.080]   And the fact that I'm talking about it right now means that I'm getting a cease-and-desist letter sent to my house.
[01:40:48.080 --> 01:40:49.520]   Yeah, I'd drop a button.
[01:40:49.520 --> 01:40:52.400]   Well, anyway, tomorrow is...
[01:40:52.400 --> 01:40:54.880]   You know, it's like a national holiday for...
[01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:55.360]   It's called the bonkers.
[01:40:55.360 --> 01:40:56.960]   Although we've been getting a lot more of them.
[01:40:56.960 --> 01:40:59.120]   They had three events last year in the end.
[01:40:59.120 --> 01:40:59.920]   It's just to be bonkers.
[01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:01.200]   It's gonna be bonkers.
[01:41:01.200 --> 01:41:03.520]   Tomorrow's gonna be a long day for us.
[01:41:03.520 --> 01:41:05.920]   I'm getting up at least at 5.30 tomorrow.
[01:41:05.920 --> 01:41:08.000]   I have so much to do before that keynote.
[01:41:08.000 --> 01:41:09.440]   So you're covering it too?
[01:41:09.440 --> 01:41:10.320]   I'm helping.
[01:41:10.320 --> 01:41:10.800]   Nice.
[01:41:10.800 --> 01:41:14.320]   And listen, I'm on staff somewhere, so I gotta come up with my...
[01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:15.040]   Angles and things.
[01:41:15.040 --> 01:41:17.040]   ...hears the things that apples look from Android.
[01:41:17.040 --> 01:41:17.600]   Yeah.
[01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:18.240]   That's my beat.
[01:41:18.240 --> 01:41:19.280]   Is that your beat now?
[01:41:19.280 --> 01:41:19.520]   Yeah.
[01:41:19.520 --> 01:41:20.720]   Here's what apples stole.
[01:41:20.720 --> 01:41:21.440]   Yeah.
[01:41:21.440 --> 01:41:23.680]   Or the other way around, here's what Google needs to do.
[01:41:23.680 --> 01:41:24.240]   That apples...
[01:41:24.240 --> 01:41:24.720]   You know...
[01:41:24.720 --> 01:41:25.360]   What do they all steal from the palm?
[01:41:25.360 --> 01:41:26.960]   That's from Deck 4.
[01:41:26.960 --> 01:41:27.680]   Palm OS.
[01:41:27.680 --> 01:41:28.720]   What do they steal from Palm?
[01:41:28.720 --> 01:41:30.480]   They should steal all the way back.
[01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:31.840]   What do they steal from handspring?
[01:41:31.840 --> 01:41:32.720]   Oh, God.
[01:41:32.720 --> 01:41:33.440]   Don't let me go.
[01:41:33.440 --> 01:41:35.920]   Don't make me go into the archives and look at that.
[01:41:35.920 --> 01:41:36.640]   Because I'm gonna steal some.
[01:41:36.640 --> 01:41:38.400]   This is the 10th anniversary, by the way.
[01:41:38.400 --> 01:41:39.200]   Yes.
[01:41:39.200 --> 01:41:39.920]   Of the what?
[01:41:39.920 --> 01:41:40.560]   The Palm...
[01:41:40.560 --> 01:41:41.280]   The pre...
[01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:41.280]   Pre...
[01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:41.760]   Pre...
[01:41:41.760 --> 01:41:42.800]   Oh!
[01:41:42.800 --> 01:41:43.920]   God, that's sad.
[01:41:43.920 --> 01:41:45.360]   I really wanted a pre.
[01:41:45.360 --> 01:41:46.800]   I still want a pre.
[01:41:46.800 --> 01:41:48.160]   I know someone who had a pre.
[01:41:48.160 --> 01:41:49.120]   I love the pre.
[01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:49.920]   You worked the palm.
[01:41:49.920 --> 01:41:51.520]   And I was like, "Ooh!"
[01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:52.720]   How do you think this is wrong?
[01:41:52.720 --> 01:41:52.880]   Do you think this is wrong?
[01:41:52.880 --> 01:41:53.920]   I don't really think now.
[01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:55.600]   It was really sluggish.
[01:41:55.600 --> 01:41:57.360]   Like they had this great OS.
[01:41:57.360 --> 01:41:57.840]   Oh, man.
[01:41:57.840 --> 01:41:58.320]   Web OS.
[01:41:58.320 --> 01:41:59.680]   You could only get it on sprint.
[01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:00.240]   Yes.
[01:42:00.240 --> 01:42:01.200]   I remember.
[01:42:01.200 --> 01:42:05.600]   And it just didn't have enough horsepower to keep up with it.
[01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:07.920]   I didn't realize Web OS was Linux-based.
[01:42:07.920 --> 01:42:10.720]   So it just couldn't run on that little phone.
[01:42:10.720 --> 01:42:11.200]   Yeah.
[01:42:11.200 --> 01:42:12.480]   The point was that a nice phone.
[01:42:12.480 --> 01:42:15.360]   I think they made the wrong bet on people wanting a sliding keyboard.
[01:42:15.360 --> 01:42:17.680]   People wanted a larger screen than the pre had.
[01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:18.480]   Right.
[01:42:18.480 --> 01:42:18.960]   So tiny.
[01:42:18.960 --> 01:42:19.440]   Thank you.
[01:42:19.440 --> 01:42:20.240]   So tiny.
[01:42:20.240 --> 01:42:21.040]   Aww.
[01:42:21.040 --> 01:42:23.200]   It was like one of those little tagamot...
[01:42:23.200 --> 01:42:23.760]   tagamot...
[01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:24.320]   tagamot...
[01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:26.720]   And the carrier show was really bad job of marketing.
[01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:29.120]   Tamagotchi.
[01:42:29.120 --> 01:42:30.000]   It was like a Tamagotchi phone.
[01:42:30.000 --> 01:42:30.480]   It was Tamagotchi.
[01:42:30.480 --> 01:42:31.120]   Of course.
[01:42:31.120 --> 01:42:32.800]   Effect of Tamagotchi.
[01:42:32.800 --> 01:42:35.280]   If you could just make phone calls and play with like,
[01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:37.360]   keep your little Tamagotchi alive on the palm pre,
[01:42:37.360 --> 01:42:38.160]   I would have been happy.
[01:42:38.160 --> 01:42:39.200]   You've read my article, right?
[01:42:39.200 --> 01:42:41.200]   You know how to like deep the Tamagotchi now and go.
[01:42:41.200 --> 01:42:42.880]   I didn't...
[01:42:42.880 --> 01:42:43.760]   No, I didn't read your article.
[01:42:43.760 --> 01:42:45.680]   How deep do the Tamagotchi go?
[01:42:46.720 --> 01:42:49.200]   Oh, well, yeah, they go really deep.
[01:42:49.200 --> 01:42:49.680]   So...
[01:42:49.680 --> 01:42:51.680]   Is that what does the fox say?
[01:42:51.680 --> 01:42:53.120]   How deep do the Tamagotchi go?
[01:42:53.120 --> 01:42:53.920]   You should write a song.
[01:42:53.920 --> 01:42:57.680]   If you go to gizmodo.com and you look for my article,
[01:42:57.680 --> 01:43:00.240]   it goes, "How I hacked Tamagotchi and became a god."
[01:43:00.240 --> 01:43:01.120]   That's the headline.
[01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:03.840]   How long ago was this?
[01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:05.280]   It was like two weeks ago.
[01:43:05.280 --> 01:43:05.920]   Recently?
[01:43:05.920 --> 01:43:06.560]   Yeah.
[01:43:06.560 --> 01:43:08.240]   Where do you even find a Tamagotchi?
[01:43:08.240 --> 01:43:10.000]   Amazon.com.
[01:43:10.000 --> 01:43:11.920]   They're coming out with a new one in July.
[01:43:11.920 --> 01:43:13.920]   You mean, "How I hacked my Tamagotchi,
[01:43:13.920 --> 01:43:15.520]   cheated death and became a god?"
[01:43:15.520 --> 01:43:15.520]   Yes.
[01:43:15.520 --> 01:43:15.920]   Yes.
[01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:16.720]   Yes.
[01:43:16.720 --> 01:43:20.160]   And this is the original Tamagotchi's.
[01:43:20.160 --> 01:43:21.600]   Well, surrounded by all the difference.
[01:43:21.600 --> 01:43:24.640]   So what happened is they kind of stopped manufacturing them.
[01:43:24.640 --> 01:43:25.920]   They came back for a question.
[01:43:25.920 --> 01:43:26.080]   Wait a minute.
[01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:27.040]   I got to explain this for...
[01:43:27.040 --> 01:43:28.800]   Because like 90% of the audience says,
[01:43:28.800 --> 01:43:30.240]   "What the hell are they talking about?"
[01:43:30.240 --> 01:43:32.320]   These are key chain size...
[01:43:32.320 --> 01:43:33.440]   They're virtual pets.
[01:43:33.440 --> 01:43:34.560]   Virtual pets.
[01:43:34.560 --> 01:43:36.240]   And they only have three buttons on them.
[01:43:36.240 --> 01:43:36.560]   Yes.
[01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:37.680]   You can feed them.
[01:43:37.680 --> 01:43:38.640]   You can play with them.
[01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:41.120]   You can do a lot with them more than you used to be able to.
[01:43:41.120 --> 01:43:43.120]   They connect via Bluetooth to your phone.
[01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:44.480]   Oh, these are the new Tamagotchi.
[01:43:44.480 --> 01:43:47.680]   Yeah. And I talked about a Windows app that I use
[01:43:47.680 --> 01:43:51.120]   called My Meets, which lets you upload your own assets and stuff.
[01:43:51.120 --> 01:43:51.760]   So...
[01:43:51.760 --> 01:43:53.040]   My kids had Tamagotchi's.
[01:43:53.040 --> 01:43:54.320]   I really loved the Tamagotchi.
[01:43:54.320 --> 01:43:55.680]   They were black and white.
[01:43:55.680 --> 01:43:56.640]   They're just walking.
[01:43:56.640 --> 01:43:57.520]   They're super collector now.
[01:43:57.520 --> 01:43:58.480]   This is much nicer now.
[01:43:58.480 --> 01:43:59.360]   Yeah.
[01:43:59.360 --> 01:44:01.200]   Are they if we saw the old Tamagotchi's?
[01:44:01.200 --> 01:44:02.880]   If you go and get the stuff from...
[01:44:02.880 --> 01:44:05.120]   That was out in Japan after they left the US.
[01:44:05.120 --> 01:44:08.160]   Because they came back briefly in 2005, 2004.
[01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:11.360]   They came briefly with the Tamagotchi connection.
[01:44:11.360 --> 01:44:13.120]   But if you get the Japanese variants,
[01:44:13.120 --> 01:44:15.520]   those things go at least $50.
[01:44:15.520 --> 01:44:16.320]   Is that what this is?
[01:44:16.320 --> 01:44:18.960]   From Bandai, the Tamagotchi on?
[01:44:18.960 --> 01:44:19.600]   Yeah.
[01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:22.480]   That's the current one that's offered in the US.
[01:44:22.480 --> 01:44:25.200]   This is the one with a green shell and a magic theme.
[01:44:25.200 --> 01:44:26.480]   Well, yes.
[01:44:26.480 --> 01:44:29.680]   There's like different accessories you can get between the different...
[01:44:29.680 --> 01:44:30.960]   Figured they bring this back.
[01:44:30.960 --> 01:44:31.200]   Yeah.
[01:44:31.200 --> 01:44:32.320]   They make you collect it.
[01:44:32.320 --> 01:44:32.800]   Yeah.
[01:44:32.800 --> 01:44:34.480]   They play with each other.
[01:44:34.480 --> 01:44:35.840]   They get married in the app.
[01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:37.200]   You know the app and you marry people.
[01:44:37.200 --> 01:44:39.520]   You can marry a Japanese Tamagotchi.
[01:44:39.520 --> 01:44:42.480]   So you're never going to see the pet rock come back.
[01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:43.760]   But apparently...
[01:44:43.760 --> 01:44:45.040]   Unless it connects to Bluetooth.
[01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:47.360]   If you can figure out how to Bluetooth rock.
[01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:47.840]   Exactly.
[01:44:47.840 --> 01:44:49.520]   Maybe.
[01:44:49.520 --> 01:44:52.320]   Wow.
[01:44:52.320 --> 01:44:53.920]   How much of these cost?
[01:44:53.920 --> 01:44:54.960]   So, okay.
[01:44:54.960 --> 01:44:56.800]   This one is $60 at IP.
[01:44:56.800 --> 01:44:57.280]   What?
[01:44:57.280 --> 01:44:58.560]   Because it has...
[01:44:58.560 --> 01:45:00.960]   I forget which chip it has in it.
[01:45:00.960 --> 01:45:04.000]   And then it has Bluetooth.
[01:45:04.000 --> 01:45:07.440]   It has infrared.
[01:45:07.440 --> 01:45:08.960]   And then the new ones that are coming out,
[01:45:08.960 --> 01:45:10.000]   the Tamagotchi picks.
[01:45:10.000 --> 01:45:11.760]   They have cameras in them.
[01:45:11.760 --> 01:45:13.600]   To like take pictures of QR codes.
[01:45:13.600 --> 01:45:15.040]   So...
[01:45:15.040 --> 01:45:15.840]   They're not like good cameras.
[01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:17.120]   Not like you would want to take a picture.
[01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:17.520]   No.
[01:45:17.520 --> 01:45:19.280]   It's a whole like thing.
[01:45:19.280 --> 01:45:20.400]   And if you go on Instagram,
[01:45:20.400 --> 01:45:23.600]   you'll see that there's a lot of people who collect Tamagotchi.
[01:45:23.600 --> 01:45:26.000]   Like there is a deep community of people.
[01:45:26.000 --> 01:45:27.440]   You know what?
[01:45:27.440 --> 01:45:29.280]   I think you could pick almost anything.
[01:45:29.280 --> 01:45:33.520]   And there would be a deep community of people who either collected or in-
[01:45:33.520 --> 01:45:34.800]   It's true. I learned that through the pandemic.
[01:45:34.800 --> 01:45:37.280]   You'll find a community for anything you need.
[01:45:37.280 --> 01:45:38.000]   Everything.
[01:45:38.000 --> 01:45:41.120]   So here's the wonder garden in Lavender at Target.
[01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:42.480]   Only 43.49.
[01:45:42.480 --> 01:45:43.040]   Yeah.
[01:45:43.040 --> 01:45:44.720]   Do you think they'll sell at that price?
[01:45:44.720 --> 01:45:46.000]   Yeah, they've been so urban.
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:47.600]   I bought a couple of urban outfitters
[01:45:47.600 --> 01:45:49.680]   because they were trying to get rid of their stock.
[01:45:49.680 --> 01:45:52.160]   And I got a couple of Tamagotchi for about 30 bucks.
[01:45:52.160 --> 01:45:54.160]   Wherever you go, they don't.
[01:45:54.160 --> 01:45:56.960]   Welcome to the new Tamagotchi on wonder garden.
[01:45:56.960 --> 01:45:58.160]   Yeah.
[01:45:58.160 --> 01:45:59.520]   There is so much to explore.
[01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:02.320]   And if I were a kid, I would have seen this at a million times already.
[01:46:02.320 --> 01:46:03.600]   The fun is always with you.
[01:46:03.600 --> 01:46:04.000]   Maybe.
[01:46:04.000 --> 01:46:05.280]   Tamagotchi on.
[01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:06.320]   Battery's not included.
[01:46:06.320 --> 01:46:07.120]   So it's that maybe.
[01:46:07.120 --> 01:46:08.240]   You have to put batteries in it?
[01:46:08.240 --> 01:46:10.240]   Yeah, because the Tamagotchi is like a couple of days.
[01:46:10.240 --> 01:46:11.520]   They're not rechargeables.
[01:46:11.520 --> 01:46:11.760]   No.
[01:46:11.760 --> 01:46:13.600]   Triple A's.
[01:46:13.600 --> 01:46:15.200]   Watch.
[01:46:15.200 --> 01:46:16.800]   They're selling on stock in town.
[01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:16.800]   Yeah.
[01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:19.760]   In fact, if I were you, I would go out and buy stock in Durasell
[01:46:19.760 --> 01:46:21.520]   because if this takes off, man.
[01:46:21.520 --> 01:46:23.200]   Triple A batteries.
[01:46:23.200 --> 01:46:23.600]   They take off.
[01:46:23.600 --> 01:46:24.000]   Bandai.
[01:46:24.000 --> 01:46:27.440]   The thing is Bandai does a lot of the stuff overseas.
[01:46:27.440 --> 01:46:28.560]   That is with the.
[01:46:28.560 --> 01:46:29.760]   Like I just-
[01:46:29.760 --> 01:46:30.560]   How did you hack it?
[01:46:30.560 --> 01:46:32.480]   With a Windows app.
[01:46:32.480 --> 01:46:37.920]   That was made by a community member named Bolter.
[01:46:37.920 --> 01:46:38.560]   And when you-
[01:46:38.560 --> 01:46:43.120]   When you hack it using Bolter's Tamagotchi hack, what do you get?
[01:46:43.120 --> 01:46:46.960]   So it basically lets you upload your own assets.
[01:46:46.960 --> 01:46:52.000]   There are some folks on Etsy who sell patches that are basically like cheats.
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:53.680]   What kind of assets?
[01:46:53.680 --> 01:46:54.960]   Like-
[01:46:54.960 --> 01:46:57.360]   What am I uploading with Popeye Chicken Sandwich?
[01:46:57.360 --> 01:46:57.680]   Okay.
[01:46:57.680 --> 01:47:03.120]   So in Japan, you can go to a Tamagotchi station and get specialized items.
[01:47:03.120 --> 01:47:06.080]   And because I have never been to Japan and I can't go right now,
[01:47:06.080 --> 01:47:09.520]   I can use them in my Meats app to get those assets.
[01:47:09.520 --> 01:47:09.920]   Wow.
[01:47:09.920 --> 01:47:13.440]   And then on top of that, they're creators,
[01:47:13.440 --> 01:47:15.280]   artists who love to do pixel art.
[01:47:15.280 --> 01:47:18.960]   And so I have like a Sailor Moon outfit for my Tamagotchi.
[01:47:18.960 --> 01:47:24.320]   I have a Pokemon station like background for my Tamagotchi.
[01:47:24.320 --> 01:47:24.960]   They don't mind.
[01:47:24.960 --> 01:47:26.400]   This is part of the ecosystem.
[01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:29.200]   No, I have a statement from Bandai.
[01:47:29.200 --> 01:47:32.720]   They said they don't necessarily encourage it.
[01:47:32.720 --> 01:47:33.120]   Yeah.
[01:47:33.120 --> 01:47:35.440]   But they don't necessarily go out and like slap them.
[01:47:35.440 --> 01:47:36.560]   They're not stopping any of these-
[01:47:36.560 --> 01:47:37.200]   They're not stopping them.
[01:47:37.200 --> 01:47:38.480]   Tamagotchi police are not going to pound it.
[01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:41.280]   Because it's not actually ruining the experience.
[01:47:41.280 --> 01:47:43.360]   It's aiding, it's adding to the experience.
[01:47:43.360 --> 01:47:46.320]   Now one thing that happened with Tamagotchi is if you didn't feed them, they die.
[01:47:46.320 --> 01:47:48.080]   They still die.
[01:47:48.080 --> 01:47:49.040]   They still die?
[01:47:49.040 --> 01:47:51.600]   Yeah, it depends on the game because each game is its own-
[01:47:51.600 --> 01:47:52.880]   What?
[01:47:52.880 --> 01:47:53.440]   Everything does.
[01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:54.000]   Everything?
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:54.560]   I'm sorry.
[01:47:54.560 --> 01:47:56.320]   Oh, was I not supposed to say that?
[01:47:56.320 --> 01:47:57.040]   You've ruined my plans.
[01:47:57.040 --> 01:47:58.480]   That was being a negative ion.
[01:47:58.480 --> 01:48:04.640]   Oh, let me take a break now that I know I really died.
[01:48:04.640 --> 01:48:06.240]   I have to really think about this.
[01:48:06.240 --> 01:48:09.520]   We are going to look forward to the Apple event.
[01:48:09.520 --> 01:48:11.120]   Tomorrow we will be here to cover it.
[01:48:11.120 --> 01:48:13.360]   I'm excited about that.
[01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:16.480]   We'll see how much I have to spend to keep up with the Joneses,
[01:48:16.480 --> 01:48:19.120]   or at least to keep up with the ions.
[01:48:19.120 --> 01:48:22.160]   Did you get the new Pixel Buds by the way?
[01:48:22.160 --> 01:48:22.720]   No.
[01:48:22.720 --> 01:48:23.200]   No.
[01:48:23.200 --> 01:48:23.680]   No.
[01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:27.280]   I had such bad experiences with every generation.
[01:48:27.280 --> 01:48:29.440]   But now people are saying, "Oh, these ones work."
[01:48:29.440 --> 01:48:30.640]   I love the Galaxy Buds.
[01:48:30.640 --> 01:48:31.200]   Those are my-
[01:48:31.200 --> 01:48:32.400]   That's my favorite too.
[01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:33.280]   I love them.
[01:48:33.280 --> 01:48:34.880]   They did a really good job with them.
[01:48:34.880 --> 01:48:37.520]   I still have my two-year-old Galaxy Buds.
[01:48:37.520 --> 01:48:38.400]   They're fine.
[01:48:38.400 --> 01:48:41.200]   I put mine through the wash yesterday by accident.
[01:48:41.200 --> 01:48:44.960]   Because when I take Mona's laundry downstairs,
[01:48:44.960 --> 01:48:47.120]   I put all the stuff in the basket to make it easy.
[01:48:47.120 --> 01:48:49.680]   I forgot to take out the headphones of the basket.
[01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:49.680]   Oh.
[01:48:49.680 --> 01:48:50.800]   Are they shot?
[01:48:50.800 --> 01:48:52.640]   My husband went and dumped them in there,
[01:48:52.640 --> 01:48:54.080]   and they work still.
[01:48:54.080 --> 01:48:55.120]   Oh, my God.
[01:48:55.120 --> 01:48:56.000]   I feel like they should work.
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:56.560]   That's what-
[01:48:56.560 --> 01:48:58.000]   Yeah, I feel like mine at work-
[01:48:58.000 --> 01:48:58.640]   I could tell you-
[01:48:58.640 --> 01:48:59.440]   A point in the technology.
[01:48:59.440 --> 01:49:01.200]   From Bitter Experience, the AirPods Pro
[01:49:01.200 --> 01:49:03.520]   do not work if you put them to the wash.
[01:49:03.520 --> 01:49:05.920]   I feel like anything that's put through a washing machine
[01:49:05.920 --> 01:49:07.920]   that's tagged should still work at this.
[01:49:07.920 --> 01:49:10.400]   I've washed half a dozen Fitbits, those don't eat them.
[01:49:10.400 --> 01:49:12.080]   Those don't-
[01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:13.280]   When you put them in your underwear,
[01:49:13.280 --> 01:49:15.120]   they were the ones where you hook on the belt
[01:49:15.120 --> 01:49:16.160]   every time I'd forget.
[01:49:16.160 --> 01:49:20.320]   And so do you have a Sailor Moon outfit that you wear,
[01:49:20.320 --> 01:49:21.760]   or is it just for your Tamagotchi?
[01:49:21.760 --> 01:49:23.440]   No, I don't do cosplay.
[01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:24.880]   I'm not a cosplayer.
[01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:25.600]   So much work.
[01:49:25.600 --> 01:49:26.400]   It's in quite a mind.
[01:49:26.400 --> 01:49:27.200]   It is another-
[01:49:27.200 --> 01:49:28.240]   I'm asking for a friend.
[01:49:28.240 --> 01:49:29.360]   I'm just saying.
[01:49:29.360 --> 01:49:31.440]   I mean, you couldn't buy that stuff on Amazon.
[01:49:31.440 --> 01:49:33.600]   If I bought you a Sailor Moon outfit-
[01:49:33.600 --> 01:49:35.520]   You want me to wear it on all that Android?
[01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:36.080]   Yes, please.
[01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:37.200]   Is that what's happening here?
[01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:37.520]   Yes.
[01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:39.280]   That really weird.
[01:49:39.280 --> 01:49:39.680]   I'm just kidding.
[01:49:39.680 --> 01:49:40.240]   Thanks.
[01:49:40.240 --> 01:49:41.760]   I'm just-
[01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:44.080]   Which wears these DM-ing me to wear the same thing.
[01:49:44.080 --> 01:49:45.360]   Oh yeah, I want you all the way.
[01:49:45.360 --> 01:49:46.080]   Yeah.
[01:49:46.080 --> 01:49:48.320]   I slid into your DMs.
[01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:48.880]   I mean, they-
[01:49:48.880 --> 01:49:50.320]   They're selling on Amazon.
[01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:51.600]   They sell men's large.
[01:49:51.600 --> 01:49:52.480]   I'm like, okay.
[01:49:52.480 --> 01:49:53.600]   I don't know.
[01:49:53.600 --> 01:49:54.720]   I admit they do too.
[01:49:54.720 --> 01:49:57.600]   I am not at all surprised.
[01:49:57.600 --> 01:50:04.080]   There was a short period of time where I was looking, though, for an Android outfit because
[01:50:04.080 --> 01:50:08.560]   John Phillips, my former boss, we had a joke about how great that would be for-
[01:50:08.560 --> 01:50:09.040]   If you look like a-
[01:50:09.040 --> 01:50:12.320]   If you were a brand, if I was just a giant Android, just-
[01:50:12.320 --> 01:50:13.840]   Aw, that would be great.
[01:50:13.840 --> 01:50:14.320]   I thought-
[01:50:14.320 --> 01:50:16.320]   So you'd be the green one with the-
[01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:16.640]   You could build it.
[01:50:16.640 --> 01:50:18.240]   The only arms can only go like this.
[01:50:18.240 --> 01:50:19.120]   Yeah, just going like this.
[01:50:19.120 --> 01:50:20.240]   You're like a little rafter.
[01:50:20.240 --> 01:50:21.680]   It's not uncomfortable.
[01:50:21.680 --> 01:50:25.840]   Just watch Adam's savages like daily builds, where he's always building things,
[01:50:25.840 --> 01:50:28.400]   and you'd get everything you needed, all the information you needed-
[01:50:28.400 --> 01:50:29.360]   That you could build your own.
[01:50:29.360 --> 01:50:32.480]   Yes, but I also need like a workshop, which I don't have.
[01:50:32.480 --> 01:50:33.680]   They have a garage?
[01:50:33.680 --> 01:50:35.840]   There's a hacker space down the road, I'm sure.
[01:50:35.840 --> 01:50:38.000]   The garage right now, we need to have a garage sale.
[01:50:38.000 --> 01:50:41.120]   Oh, I know that feeling.
[01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:44.400]   What you're saying is you can't park your S-Class Mercedes in there.
[01:50:44.400 --> 01:50:46.960]   I don't have an S-Class, but I can park my car in there.
[01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:48.640]   You can't park a Subaru in there, though.
[01:50:48.640 --> 01:50:53.200]   Of course, I've already ordered the extra large Sailor Moon outfit.
[01:50:53.200 --> 01:50:54.880]   And I actually got two.
[01:50:54.880 --> 01:50:55.360]   One of you.
[01:50:55.360 --> 01:50:56.080]   You can just send it over.
[01:50:56.080 --> 01:50:56.320]   Yeah.
[01:50:56.320 --> 01:50:57.280]   I'll wear it.
[01:50:57.280 --> 01:51:00.640]   Our show today brought to you by Indeed, Indeed.
[01:51:00.640 --> 01:51:05.440]   You're the hiring expert for your company, and what you really need is help.
[01:51:05.440 --> 01:51:06.480]   Right?
[01:51:06.480 --> 01:51:07.280]   I know you do.
[01:51:07.280 --> 01:51:08.800]   I know you do.
[01:51:08.800 --> 01:51:11.920]   Help making your short list of quality candidates.
[01:51:11.920 --> 01:51:14.720]   You need a hiring partner, if you will.
[01:51:14.720 --> 01:51:17.440]   Somebody who's going to make your life easier, you need.
[01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:22.960]   Indeed, Indeed is the job site that helps make hiring as easy as one, two,
[01:51:22.960 --> 01:51:23.200]   three.
[01:51:23.200 --> 01:51:27.360]   You post, you screen, you interview, and you do it all on Indeed.
[01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:30.480]   Get your quality shortlist of candidates because
[01:51:30.480 --> 01:51:33.520]   they're resumes on Indeed.
[01:51:33.520 --> 01:51:34.960]   Yes, they have many.
[01:51:34.960 --> 01:51:37.680]   Match your job description, and you get them faster.
[01:51:37.680 --> 01:51:41.600]   And you only, this is very important, pay for the candidates that meet.
[01:51:41.600 --> 01:51:43.600]   You must have qualifications.
[01:51:43.600 --> 01:51:47.600]   Then you could schedule and complete video interviews inside the Indeed dashboard.
[01:51:47.600 --> 01:51:49.760]   Oh, that's 11.
[01:51:49.760 --> 01:51:52.480]   Indeed makes connecting with and hiring the right talent fast
[01:51:52.480 --> 01:51:52.880]   and easy.
[01:51:52.880 --> 01:51:54.160]   You will no longer dread.
[01:51:54.160 --> 01:51:56.960]   I got a hire.
[01:51:56.960 --> 01:52:00.080]   It'll make it easy and fun.
[01:52:00.080 --> 01:52:03.680]   With tools like Indeed's Instant Match, you're going to get quality candidates
[01:52:03.680 --> 01:52:08.960]   whose resumes on Indeed fit your job description, and you're going to get them right away immediately.
[01:52:08.960 --> 01:52:16.560]   In fact, so fast, over 80% of employers get quality candidates as soon as they sponsor
[01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:17.520]   their job post.
[01:52:18.560 --> 01:52:23.520]   And by the way, you've got to use the Indeed skills test because that, on average, cuts hiring time
[01:52:23.520 --> 01:52:24.960]   by 27%.
[01:52:24.960 --> 01:52:27.600]   Just eliminates all the people who don't match, who don't fit.
[01:52:27.600 --> 01:52:29.360]   Save yourself time.
[01:52:29.360 --> 01:52:35.520]   You can choose from more than 130 pre-built skills tests, then add your must-have requirements.
[01:52:35.520 --> 01:52:37.440]   And that way, you can only save time.
[01:52:37.440 --> 01:52:41.040]   You save money because you only pay for applicants that meet those requirements.
[01:52:41.040 --> 01:52:48.160]   Talentness says Indeed delivers four times, four times more hires than all other job sites
[01:52:48.160 --> 01:52:53.520]   combined. And according to ComScore, Indeed is indeed the number one job site in the world.
[01:52:53.520 --> 01:52:55.680]   More total visits than any other job site.
[01:52:55.680 --> 01:52:56.400]   You know what that means?
[01:52:56.400 --> 01:53:01.840]   More people qualify candidates who can fit your requirements.
[01:53:01.840 --> 01:53:04.240]   If you're hiring, you need Indeed.
[01:53:04.240 --> 01:53:09.440]   Join over 3 million businesses worldwide that use Indeed to hire great talent.

[01:53:22.800 --> 01:53:23.840]   Don't suffer.
[01:53:23.840 --> 01:53:26.960]   Indeed.com/twit.
[01:53:26.960 --> 01:53:27.760]   You need Indeed.
[01:53:27.760 --> 01:53:30.400]   By the way, this offers valid through June 30th.
[01:53:30.400 --> 01:53:32.320]   So don't wait in terms of conditions apply.
[01:53:32.320 --> 01:53:34.480]   Go to Indeed.com/twit.
[01:53:34.480 --> 01:53:36.480]   We thank them so much for their support of this week in tech.
[01:53:36.480 --> 01:53:42.960]   We thank you for supporting the show by going to Indeed.com/twit.
[01:53:42.960 --> 01:53:46.160]   It is not the only way you can support Twitch.
[01:53:46.160 --> 01:53:52.640]   I'm very happy to say we have followed in the footsteps of many greats before us.
[01:53:52.640 --> 01:53:54.560]   We've created the club to it.
[01:53:54.560 --> 01:53:58.160]   This is a way for you to get ad-free versions of this show.
[01:53:58.160 --> 01:54:00.560]   All the shows we do, both that audio and video.
[01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:03.840]   And by the way, ad-free means tracker free.
[01:54:03.840 --> 01:54:06.240]   So privacy forward.
[01:54:06.240 --> 01:54:08.480]   You also get a special feed of Twitch+ content.
[01:54:08.480 --> 01:54:13.760]   Like for instance, we had the bestest conversation for about an hour before the show started today.
[01:54:13.760 --> 01:54:14.960]   That's not going to make it in the show.
[01:54:16.000 --> 01:54:22.160]   It's already a two-hour show.
[01:54:22.160 --> 01:54:27.280]   If you're a club Twitch member, it could be part of your Twitch+ bonus content.
[01:54:27.280 --> 01:54:29.600]   All the stuff that made it to the cutting room floor.
[01:54:29.600 --> 01:54:36.240]   Also, and I wish you'd told me, I didn't know you had a Discord server of your own flow for two years.
[01:54:36.240 --> 01:54:38.080]   Discord's awesome.
[01:54:38.080 --> 01:54:39.520]   We threw it in.
[01:54:39.520 --> 01:54:40.880]   We just thought, oh, that'll be cool.
[01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:42.720]   That'd be cool.
[01:54:42.720 --> 01:54:45.600]   No, the Discord is the most fun part.
[01:54:46.000 --> 01:54:48.800]   We have a live stage where people can come up on the stage.
[01:54:48.800 --> 01:54:52.880]   And if you want, if you raise your hand, you can, oh, I haven't started the stage.
[01:54:52.880 --> 01:54:53.360]   What am I?
[01:54:53.360 --> 01:54:53.840]   What?
[01:54:53.840 --> 01:54:54.560]   Oh, man.
[01:54:54.560 --> 01:54:56.640]   I did start the stage.
[01:54:56.640 --> 01:54:57.600]   It thinks I didn't know.
[01:54:57.600 --> 01:54:59.440]   I ended in the middle of an ad.
[01:54:59.440 --> 01:55:01.120]   It ended in the middle of an ad.
[01:55:01.120 --> 01:55:02.560]   That, no, okay.
[01:55:02.560 --> 01:55:05.280]   Twitch is on now.
[01:55:05.280 --> 01:55:07.920]   I didn't realize what they were talking about, but now I realize what they meant.
[01:55:07.920 --> 01:55:08.240]   Oh my God.
[01:55:08.240 --> 01:55:09.360]   They said the stage is on.
[01:55:09.360 --> 01:55:10.960]   Somebody accidentally humped the stage.
[01:55:10.960 --> 01:55:12.720]   They got rid of it.
[01:55:12.720 --> 01:55:13.760]   So it's now there.
[01:55:14.960 --> 01:55:17.680]   And John, can you put the audio in there so that people can listen?
[01:55:17.680 --> 01:55:21.360]   And by the way, if you have a comment, something you'd like to say to Roberto,
[01:55:21.360 --> 01:55:24.160]   Flo, or Harry, raise your hand.
[01:55:24.160 --> 01:55:25.280]   It's fun.
[01:55:25.280 --> 01:55:26.800]   Do you use it on an Olivet Android ever?
[01:55:26.800 --> 01:55:27.920]   The comments?
[01:55:27.920 --> 01:55:32.480]   Yeah, we have been doing a really little after all about Android shows whenever
[01:55:32.480 --> 01:55:35.440]   Ron, Jason, and I have the ability.
[01:55:35.440 --> 01:55:36.960]   And it's been nice.
[01:55:36.960 --> 01:55:37.760]   I think it's really--
[01:55:37.760 --> 01:55:38.320]   I think it's really--
[01:55:38.320 --> 01:55:41.840]   We've been doing it on the Polymer Joe one on Windows Weekly.
[01:55:41.840 --> 01:55:42.480]   Started doing it there.
[01:55:42.480 --> 01:55:43.360]   We were doing it on Twitch.
[01:55:43.360 --> 01:55:44.000]   It's really fun.
[01:55:44.000 --> 01:55:44.640]   Nice people.
[01:55:44.640 --> 01:55:47.840]   So if you have a request and you're in the Discord,
[01:55:47.840 --> 01:55:49.840]   if you're a member of the club, just raise your hand.
[01:55:49.840 --> 01:55:52.880]   Of course, we always still have all the stuff we did before the IRC.
[01:55:52.880 --> 01:55:54.000]   We pay attention to that.
[01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:54.560]   Yeah.
[01:55:54.560 --> 01:56:03.040]   We have our live feeds for the IRC viewers, so they can watch the stuff before the show.
[01:56:03.040 --> 01:56:09.840]   We, of course, have the forums at Twitter community and the Mastodon instance at Twitter
[01:56:09.840 --> 01:56:10.080]   social.
[01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:12.240]   But this is something a little extra special.
[01:56:12.240 --> 01:56:17.120]   I'm thinking, frankly, now that I'm using Discord more heavily,
[01:56:17.120 --> 01:56:18.880]   this is the better social network.
[01:56:18.880 --> 01:56:20.320]   This is what Facebook--
[01:56:20.320 --> 01:56:20.880]   Yeah.
[01:56:20.880 --> 01:56:22.400]   We've got the chats.
[01:56:22.400 --> 01:56:24.080]   Yeah.
[01:56:24.080 --> 01:56:25.520]   Then we've got--
[01:56:25.520 --> 01:56:29.680]   And by the way, we do conversations about other topics like books.
[01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:32.640]   I think Stacy's going to do a book club in there.
[01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:33.440]   Oh, I love that.
[01:56:33.440 --> 01:56:33.920]   Yeah.
[01:56:33.920 --> 01:56:34.960]   I love that.
[01:56:34.960 --> 01:56:35.920]   Lisa has a place.
[01:56:35.920 --> 01:56:36.960]   It's called Lisa's Place.
[01:56:36.960 --> 01:56:39.680]   You could talk to her about the business of Twitch.
[01:56:39.680 --> 01:56:44.800]   We have chess and trivia, and I'll even play Valheim in there in late night.
[01:56:44.800 --> 01:56:46.400]   You still have a Pokemon bot in mind,
[01:56:46.400 --> 01:56:49.360]   but then the most popular Pokemon bot closed.
[01:56:49.360 --> 01:56:49.680]   Oh.
[01:56:49.680 --> 01:56:53.280]   Because they got too expensive to man all the servers and to have all the different
[01:56:53.280 --> 01:56:56.240]   Discords like playing Pokemon at the same time.
[01:56:56.240 --> 01:57:01.840]   I put the Twivia bot in there, so you can go in there and play against other
[01:57:01.840 --> 01:57:03.520]   club members doing trivia.
[01:57:03.520 --> 01:57:04.720]   But it's too hard for me.
[01:57:04.720 --> 01:57:08.080]   Who invented Spanning Tree--
[01:57:08.080 --> 01:57:08.560]   What?
[01:57:08.560 --> 01:57:09.360]   Yeah, it's called--
[01:57:09.360 --> 01:57:09.840]   It's called--
[01:57:09.840 --> 01:57:11.760]   Who invented Spanning Tree Protocol?
[01:57:11.760 --> 01:57:15.760]   Was it Vint Cerf, Radiapurlman, Paul Vixi, or Michael Roberts?
[01:57:15.760 --> 01:57:16.320]   I wouldn't--
[01:57:16.320 --> 01:57:17.040]   I don't know.
[01:57:17.040 --> 01:57:17.920]   Does anybody know?
[01:57:17.920 --> 01:57:19.600]   I only know because I can see it on the screen.
[01:57:19.600 --> 01:57:20.640]   There's Radiapurlman.
[01:57:20.640 --> 01:57:22.160]   I don't even know who that is.
[01:57:22.160 --> 01:57:23.040]   I don't think anybody got it.
[01:57:23.040 --> 01:57:23.600]   Good job, Radiapurlman.
[01:57:23.600 --> 01:57:24.480]   How about this one?
[01:57:24.480 --> 01:57:26.400]   Which operating system was released first?
[01:57:26.400 --> 01:57:29.520]   Windows, OS2, Mac OS, or Linux?
[01:57:29.520 --> 01:57:30.640]   What?
[01:57:30.640 --> 01:57:31.360]   Mac.
[01:57:31.360 --> 01:57:32.480]   Mac OS.
[01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:32.960]   84.
[01:57:32.960 --> 01:57:33.440]   Right?
[01:57:33.440 --> 01:57:34.160]   That's what depends on the--
[01:57:34.160 --> 01:57:34.960]   Oh, no.
[01:57:34.960 --> 01:57:39.680]   No Mac OS came later because originally it was System 6,
[01:57:39.680 --> 01:57:40.880]   System 7.
[01:57:40.880 --> 01:57:42.080]   It was a call Mac OS.
[01:57:42.080 --> 01:57:44.240]   And Windows was not even an operating system
[01:57:44.240 --> 01:57:45.280]   for the first 10 years.
[01:57:45.280 --> 01:57:46.320]   So that's a complicated one.
[01:57:46.320 --> 01:57:47.840]   OK.
[01:57:47.840 --> 01:57:50.000]   Find us saying that they mean Mac, probably.
[01:57:50.000 --> 01:57:50.640]   How about this one?
[01:57:50.640 --> 01:57:53.520]   The series of the Intel HD graphics generation--
[01:57:53.520 --> 01:57:54.480]   See, this is crazy.
[01:57:54.480 --> 01:57:55.280]   Who knows this stuff?
[01:57:55.280 --> 01:57:56.480]   I don't even know this.
[01:57:56.480 --> 01:57:59.600]   Is succeeding that of the 5,000 and 6,000 series,
[01:57:59.600 --> 01:58:00.800]   Broadwell is called--
[01:58:03.120 --> 01:58:06.640]   HD graphics 7,700, 600 or 500.
[01:58:06.640 --> 01:58:09.040]   Well, you know what?
[01:58:09.040 --> 01:58:11.120]   Just math would tell us it'd be 7,000.
[01:58:11.120 --> 01:58:12.800]   Let's see what the answer is.
[01:58:12.800 --> 01:58:13.600]   Math.
[01:58:13.600 --> 01:58:15.120]   It's 500.
[01:58:15.120 --> 01:58:16.560]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[01:58:16.560 --> 01:58:17.520]   It's backwards.
[01:58:17.520 --> 01:58:18.640]   OK.
[01:58:18.640 --> 01:58:20.800]   See, this is hard.
[01:58:20.800 --> 01:58:21.840]   The trivia is hard.
[01:58:21.840 --> 01:58:22.320]   I don't play it.
[01:58:22.320 --> 01:58:22.880]   You just did?
[01:58:22.880 --> 01:58:23.440]   Like--
[01:58:23.440 --> 01:58:24.400]   Can you make it easier?
[01:58:24.400 --> 01:58:24.800]   Maybe.
[01:58:24.800 --> 01:58:25.680]   I don't know.
[01:58:25.680 --> 01:58:26.240]   Here's one I know.
[01:58:26.240 --> 01:58:27.440]   Things that people don't know.
[01:58:27.440 --> 01:58:28.400]   You can have chess games.
[01:58:28.400 --> 01:58:28.880]   We'll actually know.
[01:58:28.880 --> 01:58:30.320]   We play chess games in here.
[01:58:30.320 --> 01:58:30.960]   It's really fun.
[01:58:30.960 --> 01:58:31.280]   Anyway.
[01:58:32.800 --> 01:58:35.360]   You want to know more about Club Twit, 7 bucks a month.
[01:58:35.360 --> 01:58:37.520]   Couple of Starbucks and you're in.
[01:58:37.520 --> 01:58:39.440]   And you get all this.
[01:58:39.440 --> 01:58:42.320]   Plus a lack of my hair.
[01:58:42.320 --> 01:58:43.200]   Go to Twit--
[01:58:43.200 --> 01:58:43.680]   No, no.
[01:58:43.680 --> 01:58:44.240]   Lock it with your mouth.
[01:58:44.240 --> 01:58:45.200]   Careful, Leo.
[01:58:45.200 --> 01:58:47.040]   Before you've been asking for the hair.
[01:58:47.040 --> 01:58:48.000]   Won't be much left.
[01:58:48.000 --> 01:58:48.800]   Lock it here, not angry.
[01:58:48.800 --> 01:58:49.520]   Yeah, where's my hair?
[01:58:49.520 --> 01:58:49.760]   Go to--
[01:58:49.760 --> 01:58:55.120]   Go to twit.tv/clubtwit to learn more.
[01:58:55.120 --> 01:58:57.280]   I made a mistake of doing that when we were
[01:58:57.280 --> 01:58:58.400]   raising money for Unicef.
[01:58:58.400 --> 01:58:59.760]   Remember, I said I'll shave my head.
[01:58:59.760 --> 01:59:00.480]   Oh, yeah.
[01:59:00.480 --> 01:59:01.360]   That was a bad idea.
[01:59:01.360 --> 01:59:04.240]   If we got like $50,000, we did and I did.
[01:59:04.240 --> 01:59:04.960]   And then--
[01:59:04.960 --> 01:59:07.440]   And then I forgot that I was going to get married a month later.
[01:59:07.440 --> 01:59:09.680]   So all my wedding pictures.
[01:59:09.680 --> 01:59:11.840]   Oh, that's why you--
[01:59:11.840 --> 01:59:12.640]   Okay.
[01:59:12.640 --> 01:59:13.440]   That makes sense.
[01:59:13.440 --> 01:59:14.960]   All my wedding pictures I'm bald.
[01:59:14.960 --> 01:59:16.960]   What is for charity?
[01:59:16.960 --> 01:59:18.800]   I kept telling my wife that.
[01:59:18.800 --> 01:59:19.840]   She wasn't impressed.
[01:59:19.840 --> 01:59:20.880]   Couldn't you have shaved that for the last--
[01:59:20.880 --> 01:59:22.160]   I said think of the kids.
[01:59:22.160 --> 01:59:23.280]   No, they insisted.
[01:59:23.280 --> 01:59:25.040]   In fact, I was slow to shave it.
[01:59:25.040 --> 01:59:25.680]   They insisted.
[01:59:25.680 --> 01:59:27.120]   You know, you shaving it out.
[01:59:27.120 --> 01:59:30.080]   And then I had a clipper and shaved it on the show.
[01:59:30.800 --> 01:59:31.920]   And they said, no, that's not good enough.
[01:59:31.920 --> 01:59:33.040]   You have to bick it.
[01:59:33.040 --> 01:59:35.200]   So I had to go to a barber with a straight razor.
[01:59:35.200 --> 01:59:35.680]   Are you-- What?
[01:59:35.680 --> 01:59:37.920]   Hey, that's not good enough.
[01:59:37.920 --> 01:59:38.640]   That we raised.
[01:59:38.640 --> 01:59:41.200]   And then I said 70,000, I'll get a tattoo.
[01:59:41.200 --> 01:59:43.200]   No, nobody--
[01:59:43.200 --> 01:59:44.640]   No, wait, wait.
[01:59:44.640 --> 01:59:45.520]   I have a tattoo.
[01:59:45.520 --> 01:59:47.360]   What's a tattoo of?
[01:59:47.360 --> 01:59:48.400]   Twit on my butt.
[01:59:48.400 --> 01:59:48.880]   Oh, my.
[01:59:48.880 --> 01:59:49.440]   Want to see it?
[01:59:49.440 --> 01:59:50.240]   Oh, my.
[01:59:50.240 --> 01:59:50.720]   I'm good.
[01:59:50.720 --> 01:59:52.720]   I've seen tattoos.
[01:59:52.720 --> 01:59:53.360]   I know.
[01:59:53.360 --> 01:59:54.640]   It's the smallest.
[01:59:54.640 --> 01:59:55.440]   I've seen the logo.
[01:59:55.440 --> 01:59:56.320]   You would actually laugh.
[01:59:56.320 --> 01:59:57.680]   It looks like a mole.
[01:59:57.680 --> 02:00:00.400]   It's the smallest tattoo I could get.
[02:00:00.720 --> 02:00:02.480]   And we had to get-- it was midnight.
[02:00:02.480 --> 02:00:05.040]   Well, you really got a tattoo, Leo.
[02:00:05.040 --> 02:00:05.680]   On air.
[02:00:05.680 --> 02:00:07.360]   It was midnight.
[02:00:07.360 --> 02:00:07.920]   With your butt?
[02:00:07.920 --> 02:00:09.440]   We were calling-- well, it wasn't my--
[02:00:09.440 --> 02:00:10.800]   it was high on the butt.
[02:00:10.800 --> 02:00:12.000]   Like your-- like your--
[02:00:12.000 --> 02:00:15.680]   Did you get a stamp, a Leo stamp?
[02:00:15.680 --> 02:00:16.720]   Yeah, it's a tram stamp.
[02:00:16.720 --> 02:00:17.760]   It's a Leo stamp.
[02:00:17.760 --> 02:00:18.240]   Mm.
[02:00:18.240 --> 02:00:20.000]   We don't say trampoline.
[02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:20.800]   No judgment.
[02:00:20.800 --> 02:00:21.280]   We say--
[02:00:21.280 --> 02:00:23.440]   Well, it certainly hasn't helped me get chicks.
[02:00:23.440 --> 02:00:24.240]   So I don't know.
[02:00:24.240 --> 02:00:26.480]   I don't think it's good for nothing.
[02:00:26.480 --> 02:00:28.800]   In fact, all that happens is I forget about it.
[02:00:28.800 --> 02:00:30.800]   And Lisa goes, oh, there's that tattoo again.
[02:00:30.800 --> 02:00:32.320]   Wow.
[02:00:32.320 --> 02:00:33.920]   That again.
[02:00:33.920 --> 02:00:34.560]   That again.
[02:00:34.560 --> 02:00:35.520]   I can't cut on the pants though.
[02:00:35.520 --> 02:00:36.080]   I said, think of the kids.
[02:00:36.080 --> 02:00:36.880]   We raised money.
[02:00:36.880 --> 02:00:40.000]   We built a hospital in South America.
[02:00:40.000 --> 02:00:40.800]   Oh, see?
[02:00:40.800 --> 02:00:41.920]   With the money we raised--
[02:00:41.920 --> 02:00:42.400]   Sounds right.
[02:00:42.400 --> 02:00:43.680]   I would get a tattoo for--
[02:00:43.680 --> 02:00:44.000]   Yeah.
[02:00:44.000 --> 02:00:44.480]   But--
[02:00:44.480 --> 02:00:45.600]   I think it was worthwhile.
[02:00:45.600 --> 02:00:47.840]   But I'm not going to send you a lock on my hair.
[02:00:47.840 --> 02:00:49.360]   It's not going to happen.
[02:00:49.360 --> 02:00:50.480]   Because that's how--
[02:00:50.480 --> 02:00:50.880]   That's how--
[02:00:50.880 --> 02:00:51.760]   That's how--
[02:00:51.760 --> 02:00:52.640]   Dark magic starts.
[02:00:52.640 --> 02:00:54.160]   Yeah, that's how they--
[02:00:54.160 --> 02:00:54.720]   That's how people--
[02:00:54.720 --> 02:00:55.360]   That's the big way.
[02:00:55.360 --> 02:00:56.880]   That's how people put hexes on you.
[02:00:56.880 --> 02:01:00.000]   Do you save your fingernail clippings and your hair after--
[02:01:00.000 --> 02:01:00.480]   I have--
[02:01:00.480 --> 02:01:02.000]   I'm from a very large Mexican family.
[02:01:02.000 --> 02:01:03.600]   And I will say that they're members of my family
[02:01:03.600 --> 02:01:06.560]   who do not leave their hair or their fingernail clippings--
[02:01:06.560 --> 02:01:07.840]   Because of Santa Maria.
[02:01:07.840 --> 02:01:08.320]   Yeah.
[02:01:08.320 --> 02:01:08.880]   Because of that.
[02:01:08.880 --> 02:01:12.080]   It is a valid concern of theirs.
[02:01:12.080 --> 02:01:12.880]   Well--
[02:01:12.880 --> 02:01:14.240]   And I'm like, OK.
[02:01:14.240 --> 02:01:14.800]   I'm just like--
[02:01:14.800 --> 02:01:18.640]   I don't know if he ever met Barry and Samdi.
[02:01:18.640 --> 02:01:19.440]   He's a nice guy.
[02:01:19.440 --> 02:01:21.120]   That's so bad.
[02:01:21.120 --> 02:01:22.000]   He's got a bad rep.
[02:01:23.840 --> 02:01:27.920]   The FBI director comparing Ransomware Challenge to--
[02:01:27.920 --> 02:01:28.960]   Yes, we're back on.
[02:01:28.960 --> 02:01:29.440]   Sorry.
[02:01:29.440 --> 02:01:30.080]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[02:01:30.080 --> 02:01:30.720]   We're going to--
[02:01:30.720 --> 02:01:31.680]   Back to the show.
[02:01:31.680 --> 02:01:32.880]   It was just a couple more stories.
[02:01:32.880 --> 02:01:37.840]   Chris Ray says, this is an equivalent challenge to the line 11.
[02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:39.360]   I have to say, I'm kind of agreeing with him.
[02:01:39.360 --> 02:01:42.320]   Especially since these guys often seem to be aligned
[02:01:42.320 --> 02:01:43.120]   with nation states.
[02:01:43.120 --> 02:01:45.520]   Maybe not working for nation states,
[02:01:45.520 --> 02:01:47.760]   but aligned with nation states.
[02:01:47.760 --> 02:01:49.520]   But the problem is, what do you--
[02:01:49.520 --> 02:01:52.240]   I mean, what are you going to do to solve it, Chris Ray?
[02:01:52.880 --> 02:01:54.560]   How do you fix this?
[02:01:54.560 --> 02:01:56.320]   Get it together, Chris.
[02:01:56.320 --> 02:01:57.840]   Diplomatic negotiations?
[02:01:57.840 --> 02:02:06.560]   I don't know what the state of infosec is in the US government,
[02:02:06.560 --> 02:02:08.000]   because I don't cover infosec anymore.
[02:02:08.000 --> 02:02:10.080]   Here's a headline.
[02:02:10.080 --> 02:02:10.560]   I miss it, but I--
[02:02:10.560 --> 02:02:13.120]   Here's a headline you're glad you didn't have to write from Reuters.
[02:02:13.120 --> 02:02:17.840]   US says, Ransomware attack on meatpacker JBS, likely from Russia,
[02:02:17.840 --> 02:02:20.560]   semi-colon cattle slaughter resuming.
[02:02:20.560 --> 02:02:22.400]   Wow, they threw everything in there.
[02:02:23.280 --> 02:02:24.240]   Jobs, CNBC.
[02:02:24.240 --> 02:02:26.640]   We got Ransomware, we got JBS.
[02:02:26.640 --> 02:02:28.160]   We got cattle slaughter.
[02:02:28.160 --> 02:02:29.280]   What else do we need to say?
[02:02:29.280 --> 02:02:30.560]   Oh, they're still killing cows.
[02:02:30.560 --> 02:02:31.360]   Let's get that in there, too.
[02:02:31.360 --> 02:02:35.600]   For one day, JBS was halted.
[02:02:35.600 --> 02:02:38.080]   Here's the story that really kind of greats a little bit.
[02:02:38.080 --> 02:02:39.760]   Remember the colonial pipeline attack?
[02:02:39.760 --> 02:02:42.640]   And everybody, especially in the southeast,
[02:02:42.640 --> 02:02:46.800]   was putting gas cans in their trunk, because we were very worried.
[02:02:46.800 --> 02:02:51.200]   Turns out the way they got in colonial pipeline,
[02:02:51.200 --> 02:02:54.400]   they used a VPN with a password that was known.
[02:02:54.400 --> 02:02:57.680]   The VPN server was still running,
[02:02:57.680 --> 02:03:00.720]   but nobody had been using the software apparently in a while.
[02:03:00.720 --> 02:03:05.040]   The account's password was on a bunch of leaked passwords on the dark web,
[02:03:05.040 --> 02:03:08.240]   which means probably the employee who created the password
[02:03:08.240 --> 02:03:12.320]   used the same password on another account that was previously hacked.
[02:03:12.320 --> 02:03:18.240]   That's how they say it wasn't a spearfishing attack.
[02:03:18.240 --> 02:03:21.600]   It's never as complicated as people think.
[02:03:21.600 --> 02:03:26.080]   That's what it comes down with with most security and hacking stories.
[02:03:26.080 --> 02:03:29.920]   It's almost never like someone was doing all these things in breaking encryption.
[02:03:29.920 --> 02:03:33.360]   It's always like, "I called a guy, and then the guy gave me the password,
[02:03:33.360 --> 02:03:38.080]   because I told him I was the wife of the CEO, and then I got in, and I stole things."
[02:03:38.080 --> 02:03:38.480]   That's it.
[02:03:38.480 --> 02:03:43.200]   So just for future reference, a few things they did wrong.
[02:03:43.200 --> 02:03:46.560]   One, they allowed the employee to choose the password.
[02:03:46.560 --> 02:03:50.160]   And of course, the employee just said, "Well, I always use Monkey123,
[02:03:50.160 --> 02:03:51.600]   so I don't want to forget it."
[02:03:51.600 --> 02:03:53.040]   - Oh, damn it, Leo. Now I got to change the password.
[02:03:53.040 --> 02:03:58.400]   - Two, they didn't insist on two factor. There was no two factor on it.
[02:03:58.400 --> 02:04:02.720]   Three, when the employee left, they didn't deactivate the account.
[02:04:02.720 --> 02:04:05.760]   It was unused, but still active.
[02:04:05.760 --> 02:04:09.120]   I mean, yeah, they got hacked.
[02:04:09.120 --> 02:04:15.520]   Every company should send somebody every year to DEFCON or Black Hat,
[02:04:15.520 --> 02:04:20.400]   and just sit there and be terrified, and realize when you go home back to your company, you're like,
[02:04:20.400 --> 02:04:26.160]   "We're hosed. We got to figure out how to fix this. We got to do whatever we have to do to make this right."
[02:04:26.160 --> 02:04:27.120]   - It's depressing.
[02:04:27.120 --> 02:04:33.200]   - Because it's almost always user error, or you just don't know any better,
[02:04:33.200 --> 02:04:37.760]   you don't really think about it, and you're like, "Oh, that'll be fine. It's just a VPN.
[02:04:37.760 --> 02:04:41.360]   It gives access to the thing." - No big deal, to the pipeline.
[02:04:42.480 --> 02:04:47.840]   - It's like the water company in Florida, the guy sitting there at the controls,
[02:04:47.840 --> 02:04:50.000]   and somebody's moving them. I said, "What happened?"
[02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:51.280]   Somebody's moving the mouse.
[02:04:51.280 --> 02:04:55.840]   "Oh, he just turned up all the ammonia in the tank. What's going on?"
[02:04:55.840 --> 02:05:00.880]   The same thing, VPN account. They were all using the same password.
[02:05:00.880 --> 02:05:05.200]   - A weird way, and we're almost hopeful, just because there are actually
[02:05:05.200 --> 02:05:08.000]   our things, which if people did them could fix this?
[02:05:08.000 --> 02:05:09.040]   - Could fix this.
[02:05:09.040 --> 02:05:10.080]   - That takes a lot of us.
[02:05:10.080 --> 02:05:10.480]   - Yes.
[02:05:10.480 --> 02:05:11.600]   - If people did them.
[02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:15.120]   - But it is amazing. They haven't done them, particularly after all these other
[02:05:15.120 --> 02:05:17.360]   horrible cases of cyber hacking.
[02:05:17.360 --> 02:05:23.200]   - It's so insane, because there's really crazy things.
[02:05:23.200 --> 02:05:27.040]   Stuxnet is insane when you look into it.
[02:05:27.040 --> 02:05:28.160]   Kim Zetter has a great book.
[02:05:28.160 --> 02:05:32.480]   If you want to learn about Stuxnet, you want to get really deep into insane info sec stuff.
[02:05:32.480 --> 02:05:35.760]   But a lot of it is just, "I called a person."
[02:05:35.760 --> 02:05:36.640]   - It's really good.
[02:05:36.640 --> 02:05:38.560]   - Or I found a password on the side.
[02:05:38.560 --> 02:05:39.440]   - Yeah.
[02:05:39.440 --> 02:05:42.640]   - Or the thing where they got into every Twitter account they wanted to was
[02:05:42.640 --> 02:05:44.000]   incredibly simple, apparently.
[02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:44.400]   - Yeah.
[02:05:44.400 --> 02:05:46.880]   Everything is always someone made a boo-boo.
[02:05:46.880 --> 02:05:52.080]   - Speaking of SpaceX, so John, you were telling me earlier,
[02:05:52.080 --> 02:05:57.120]   "John is our space expert, John Slanina, our studio manager."
[02:05:57.120 --> 02:06:01.120]   They're going to now launch the vehicle in the air.
[02:06:01.120 --> 02:06:05.120]   This is the thing, the rocket that we've been seeing go up and down with the fins.
[02:06:05.680 --> 02:06:08.560]   They're now going to go into orbit with the rocket, right?
[02:06:08.560 --> 02:06:15.760]   And the Pentagon has announced they want to use Starship and other rockets like it to deliver
[02:06:15.760 --> 02:06:16.320]   cargo.
[02:06:16.320 --> 02:06:20.720]   So these wouldn't go into orbit, they would just go up and down.
[02:06:20.720 --> 02:06:24.720]   And because remember, Elon must be able to land these things.
[02:06:24.720 --> 02:06:26.240]   - Yeah, so you can use it again and again and again.
[02:06:26.240 --> 02:06:27.200]   - And use it again and again.
[02:06:27.200 --> 02:06:30.800]   So it would just be like a fast jet, I guess.
[02:06:30.800 --> 02:06:34.160]   - Got him in each one of his children up there.
[02:06:34.160 --> 02:06:34.560]   - Yeah.
[02:06:35.600 --> 02:06:39.840]   - The air, I don't get the reference, he's going to launch his children.
[02:06:39.840 --> 02:06:42.640]   - Well, when he moves everybody to Mars.
[02:06:42.640 --> 02:06:43.920]   - Oh, yeah, yeah.
[02:06:43.920 --> 02:06:44.800]   - We're all launching.
[02:06:44.800 --> 02:06:45.280]   - He has six children.
[02:06:45.280 --> 02:06:46.320]   You got to know somebody.
[02:06:46.320 --> 02:06:48.320]   - Sure, I've got plenty of kids.
[02:06:48.320 --> 02:06:49.440]   - I've seen a couple of them.
[02:06:49.440 --> 02:06:49.760]   - A couple of them a lot.
[02:06:49.760 --> 02:06:54.880]   Air Force said Friday is expanding a program that wants to leverage reusable rockets like
[02:06:54.880 --> 02:06:57.120]   those SpaceX is building to deliver cargo.
[02:06:57.120 --> 02:07:00.080]   It's called clever name rocket cargo.
[02:07:00.080 --> 02:07:02.080]   And it will...
[02:07:02.080 --> 02:07:03.920]   - A new game on the switch.
[02:07:03.920 --> 02:07:05.520]   - That's a couple of them.
[02:07:05.520 --> 02:07:06.880]   - I want rocket plane rocket cargo.
[02:07:06.880 --> 02:07:07.440]   - I want rocket plane rocket cargo.
[02:07:07.440 --> 02:07:08.800]   - You're the shuttle to keep that.
[02:07:08.800 --> 02:07:13.600]   - How much cargo you can put in, what area depending on the weather?
[02:07:13.600 --> 02:07:15.440]   - Actually, if the...
[02:07:15.440 --> 02:07:19.040]   - If the Pentagon was smart, they would actually create that game
[02:07:19.040 --> 02:07:22.720]   and use the inputs from the user, be like Ender's game.
[02:07:22.720 --> 02:07:24.640]   You didn't know you thought you were playing the game,
[02:07:24.640 --> 02:07:26.480]   but actually you're landing cargo rockets.
[02:07:26.480 --> 02:07:28.160]   For reels.
[02:07:28.160 --> 02:07:31.920]   The program will research and help develop a capability such as
[02:07:31.920 --> 02:07:36.480]   "landing a rocket on a wide range of non-traditional materials and surfaces."
[02:07:36.480 --> 02:07:39.760]   Maybe like this cushioned that I'm seeing on.
[02:07:39.760 --> 02:07:41.440]   - Yeah, they get land on the cushioned file.
[02:07:41.440 --> 02:07:42.320]   - I don't know.
[02:07:42.320 --> 02:07:43.120]   - Or in the woods.
[02:07:43.120 --> 02:07:45.120]   - On a boat.
[02:07:45.120 --> 02:07:48.640]   - If a rocket lands in the woods, and nobody's there to hear it.
[02:07:48.640 --> 02:07:50.800]   - Does it really land?
[02:07:50.800 --> 02:07:54.400]   - It's really delivering arms to contrast.
[02:07:54.400 --> 02:07:57.600]   - Oh, they also want to build a rocket cargo bay
[02:07:57.600 --> 02:08:00.960]   and logistics for rapid loading and unloading.
[02:08:00.960 --> 02:08:03.680]   If you're going to move it on a rocket, you got to get it off fast, right?
[02:08:03.680 --> 02:08:04.320]   - That's true.
[02:08:04.320 --> 02:08:09.040]   - Air dropping cargo from the rocket after re-entry in order to serve as locations
[02:08:09.040 --> 02:08:11.040]   where a rocket cannot possibly land.
[02:08:11.040 --> 02:08:12.480]   So while you're...
[02:08:12.480 --> 02:08:14.800]   Drop it out there.
[02:08:14.800 --> 02:08:19.600]   $50 million in the Air Force's 2022 budget to study this.
[02:08:19.600 --> 02:08:20.640]   - Okay.
[02:08:20.640 --> 02:08:21.680]   - To study it.
[02:08:21.680 --> 02:08:22.800]   - To study it.
[02:08:22.800 --> 02:08:24.880]   - To study it, because once if it goes live,
[02:08:24.880 --> 02:08:27.280]   space assets, they become Lockheed Martin.
[02:08:27.280 --> 02:08:27.760]   - Yeah.
[02:08:27.760 --> 02:08:28.640]   - They become Northrop.
[02:08:28.640 --> 02:08:29.120]   - They become...
[02:08:29.120 --> 02:08:30.160]   - You know, I think they're already set.
[02:08:30.160 --> 02:08:31.920]   - They got the big NASA contract.
[02:08:31.920 --> 02:08:32.720]   - Yeah, they're gonna...
[02:08:32.720 --> 02:08:33.680]   - They're already set.
[02:08:33.680 --> 02:08:34.960]   - Tesla may...
[02:08:34.960 --> 02:08:35.520]   may...
[02:08:35.520 --> 02:08:37.440]   may go away someday.
[02:08:37.440 --> 02:08:38.000]   Who knows?
[02:08:38.000 --> 02:08:39.840]   There's a lot of weirdness, especially with their China,
[02:08:39.840 --> 02:08:41.760]   and what's going on with the vehicles.
[02:08:41.760 --> 02:08:42.880]   The SpaceX is fine.
[02:08:42.880 --> 02:08:44.160]   - Nice.
[02:08:44.160 --> 02:08:44.640]   - And if it's...
[02:08:44.640 --> 02:08:44.960]   Yeah.
[02:08:44.960 --> 02:08:46.320]   And we're all going to Mars, apparently.
[02:08:46.320 --> 02:08:46.880]   - Yeah.
[02:08:46.880 --> 02:08:48.160]   - Even though it's Mars kind of sucks.
[02:08:48.160 --> 02:08:49.200]   - I'm gonna stay here.
[02:08:49.200 --> 02:08:49.760]   - Mars sucks.
[02:08:49.760 --> 02:08:50.560]   - Mars sucks.
[02:08:50.560 --> 02:08:50.560]   - Mars sucks.
[02:08:50.560 --> 02:08:53.120]   - Have fun in your perpetual Vegas.
[02:08:53.120 --> 02:08:53.200]   - It's not place to raise a kid.
[02:08:53.200 --> 02:08:53.840]   That's why I hear it.
[02:08:53.840 --> 02:08:55.600]   - It's not place to raise a kid.
[02:08:55.600 --> 02:08:55.760]   - Yeah.
[02:08:55.760 --> 02:08:58.480]   - I know it's cold as hell.
[02:08:58.480 --> 02:08:59.200]   - It's cold as hell.
[02:08:59.200 --> 02:09:00.080]   That's what's going around.
[02:09:00.080 --> 02:09:00.880]   That's what people are saying.
[02:09:00.880 --> 02:09:01.520]   I don't know.
[02:09:01.520 --> 02:09:02.800]   You know, I just know what I hear.
[02:09:02.800 --> 02:09:04.640]   - It's gonna be a long, long time for that happens anyway.
[02:09:04.640 --> 02:09:05.520]   - People say that though.
[02:09:05.520 --> 02:09:06.720]   I hear them say that.
[02:09:06.720 --> 02:09:13.200]   Ladies and gentlemen, you have been witness to something truly amazing.
[02:09:13.200 --> 02:09:17.680]   The chemistry created by four people in the same room,
[02:09:17.680 --> 02:09:21.440]   breathing the same air without masks.
[02:09:21.440 --> 02:09:22.240]   - That's what you know.
[02:09:22.240 --> 02:09:24.240]   - We're not even socially distanced.
[02:09:24.240 --> 02:09:24.480]   - Nope.
[02:09:24.480 --> 02:09:24.880]   - Look at that.
[02:09:24.880 --> 02:09:25.600]   I can touch Leo.
[02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:26.000]   - Ah!
[02:09:28.080 --> 02:09:29.120]   Thank you so much.
[02:09:29.120 --> 02:09:30.560]   Roberto, it's so good to see you.
[02:09:30.560 --> 02:09:31.920]   I really appreciate your coming up.
[02:09:31.920 --> 02:09:34.720]   I hope you get the little woman something delicious for dinner on the way home.
[02:09:34.720 --> 02:09:35.840]   - I hope so too.
[02:09:35.840 --> 02:09:38.720]   I love my wife and I want her to be real pampered.
[02:09:38.720 --> 02:09:39.680]   - Absolutely.
[02:09:39.680 --> 02:09:40.800]   - Oh, I like good food too.
[02:09:40.800 --> 02:09:42.160]   - Pancakes and Popeyes.
[02:09:42.160 --> 02:09:42.800]   That's what I'm saying.
[02:09:42.800 --> 02:09:43.600]   - Pancakes and Popeyes.
[02:09:43.600 --> 02:09:45.360]   Mr. Harry McCracken,
[02:09:45.360 --> 02:09:48.400]   you are the wonderful technologizer at Fast Company.
[02:09:48.400 --> 02:09:49.760]   Technology editor there.
[02:09:49.760 --> 02:09:51.920]   Tell me something you're working on.
[02:09:51.920 --> 02:09:52.560]   What are you working on?
[02:09:52.560 --> 02:09:53.280]   Something exciting.
[02:09:53.280 --> 02:09:54.400]   Anything interesting?
[02:09:54.400 --> 02:09:56.960]   - Gosh, we're working on a lot of stuff I can't talk about.
[02:09:56.960 --> 02:09:57.600]   - Yes, see?
[02:09:57.600 --> 02:09:59.360]   - We'll be looking at WWDC tomorrow.
[02:09:59.360 --> 02:10:03.200]   We have a program called the Next Big Things in Tech
[02:10:03.200 --> 02:10:07.840]   where we will eventually be giving out some awards to stuff that's still early on.
[02:10:07.840 --> 02:10:08.400]   - Oh, good.
[02:10:08.400 --> 02:10:10.640]   - We have stuff like the most innovative company is which are
[02:10:10.640 --> 02:10:13.040]   is really about stuff that's out there.
[02:10:13.040 --> 02:10:16.160]   - This is a great niche, not only for you, but for Fast Company.
[02:10:16.160 --> 02:10:16.640]   - Yeah.
[02:10:16.640 --> 02:10:20.400]   - A really good place so that you're otherwise you don't want to be one of a,
[02:10:20.400 --> 02:10:21.600]   you don't want to be in another verge.
[02:10:21.600 --> 02:10:22.880]   You want to be something unique and different.
[02:10:22.880 --> 02:10:25.040]   I think Fast Company is a great position to do that.
[02:10:25.040 --> 02:10:26.800]   - We're in the process of judging this right now.
[02:10:26.800 --> 02:10:27.920]   Which was fun.
[02:10:27.920 --> 02:10:28.000]   - Good.
[02:10:28.000 --> 02:10:28.720]   - Great.
[02:10:28.720 --> 02:10:30.800]   So nice to see you again and Marie.
[02:10:30.800 --> 02:10:32.080]   Thank you for coming.
[02:10:32.080 --> 02:10:33.200]   Really appreciate it.
[02:10:33.200 --> 02:10:36.080]   Did you drive this guy at photo up?
[02:10:36.080 --> 02:10:37.840]   Thank you for bringing Mike.
[02:10:37.840 --> 02:10:38.800]   - No, he came on his own.
[02:10:38.800 --> 02:10:39.520]   - He came on his own.
[02:10:39.520 --> 02:10:40.640]   - You drove this guy.
[02:10:40.640 --> 02:10:43.760]   We really are glad Mike McDonald's also here.
[02:10:43.760 --> 02:10:47.920]   At photo, if you want to see pictures of this con fab,
[02:10:47.920 --> 02:10:49.360]   it was something.
[02:10:49.360 --> 02:10:52.400]   See, Flo with her magic orb.
[02:10:52.400 --> 02:10:54.720]   - I got an orb too.
[02:10:54.720 --> 02:10:55.280]   Thank you, Michael.
[02:10:55.280 --> 02:10:55.920]   - Did you get an orb?
[02:10:55.920 --> 02:10:56.400]   - Yep.
[02:10:56.400 --> 02:10:57.680]   - You are a bit fine to everybody.
[02:10:57.680 --> 02:10:59.680]   - Thank you, Mike, for opening this.
[02:10:59.680 --> 02:11:00.320]   - Thank you, Mike.
[02:11:00.320 --> 02:11:03.200]   Twitter.com/ADPhoto.
[02:11:03.200 --> 02:11:03.920]   Florence I am.
[02:11:03.920 --> 02:11:06.000]   We'll see you Tuesday on all about Andrew,
[02:11:06.000 --> 02:11:07.280]   of course, in N'Gizmodo.
[02:11:07.280 --> 02:11:07.840]   - Correct.
[02:11:07.840 --> 02:11:08.560]   - All the time.
[02:11:08.560 --> 02:11:10.880]   You're writing about all the fun stuff on N'Gizmodo.
[02:11:10.880 --> 02:11:11.920]   You got that great beat.
[02:11:11.920 --> 02:11:13.760]   - I got really lucky.
[02:11:13.760 --> 02:11:16.800]   I work with my pal, Caitlin McGarry.
[02:11:16.800 --> 02:11:17.760]   She's my editor.
[02:11:17.760 --> 02:11:18.800]   So it's like...
[02:11:18.800 --> 02:11:20.080]   - Nice.
[02:11:20.080 --> 02:11:20.640]   - Yeah.
[02:11:20.640 --> 02:11:21.520]   It's nice.
[02:11:21.520 --> 02:11:22.480]   It's good.
[02:11:22.480 --> 02:11:24.240]   I get to write about everything I want.
[02:11:24.240 --> 02:11:26.240]   - You work on anything, you know, cool and different.
[02:11:26.240 --> 02:11:28.240]   - Like Harry, things I can't talk about.
[02:11:28.240 --> 02:11:30.560]   - Can you write about,
[02:11:30.560 --> 02:11:33.840]   'cause I bought it, but that was like one a year ago.
[02:11:33.840 --> 02:11:36.800]   Who was it doing the game machine that had a crank on it?
[02:11:36.800 --> 02:11:37.600]   - Yeah.
[02:11:37.600 --> 02:11:38.400]   - There are...
[02:11:38.400 --> 02:11:39.520]   - What the hell happened to that?
[02:11:39.520 --> 02:11:40.880]   - They said they have an announcement coming
[02:11:40.880 --> 02:11:42.640]   very shortly about availability.
[02:11:42.640 --> 02:11:44.160]   I got an email 'cause I was on their list.
[02:11:44.160 --> 02:11:44.960]   - Yeah, I bought it.
[02:11:44.960 --> 02:11:45.760]   - FTP claim.
[02:11:45.760 --> 02:11:46.560]   - I sent them money.
[02:11:46.560 --> 02:11:47.120]   - They do?
[02:11:47.120 --> 02:11:48.240]   - That's right.
[02:11:48.240 --> 02:11:48.640]   - Yeah, that's the...
[02:11:48.640 --> 02:11:49.280]   - Panic?
[02:11:49.280 --> 02:11:49.280]   - Panic.
[02:11:49.280 --> 02:11:49.920]   - Panic.
[02:11:49.920 --> 02:11:50.480]   Panic.
[02:11:50.480 --> 02:11:50.640]   - Panic.
[02:11:50.640 --> 02:11:53.040]   - Like their first like really good thing was this wonderful FTP.
[02:11:53.040 --> 02:11:54.640]   - I usually have a little panic.
[02:11:54.640 --> 02:11:55.280]   - I use all the panic software.
[02:11:55.280 --> 02:11:56.880]   I've sent them a lot of money over the years.
[02:11:56.880 --> 02:11:59.280]   But this play date was kind of wild.
[02:11:59.280 --> 02:12:01.520]   Oh, their announcement is Tuesday.
[02:12:01.520 --> 02:12:03.120]   - Ooh, the day after.
[02:12:03.120 --> 02:12:05.120]   - So boy, that was right on.
[02:12:05.120 --> 02:12:07.280]   9 a.m. Pacific.
[02:12:07.280 --> 02:12:08.080]   They're gonna announce...
[02:12:08.080 --> 02:12:11.040]   - This is the game box with a crank on it.
[02:12:11.040 --> 02:12:12.480]   - I mean, it's got a little star,
[02:12:12.480 --> 02:12:13.760]   so it has to be good news.
[02:12:13.760 --> 02:12:15.600]   - And you subscribed to Seasons of Games?
[02:12:15.600 --> 02:12:16.960]   - Ah, interesting.
[02:12:16.960 --> 02:12:18.960]   Yeah, I sent them some money.
[02:12:18.960 --> 02:12:23.920]   They also did the untitled Goose game, which was awesome.
[02:12:23.920 --> 02:12:24.880]   - They did?
[02:12:24.880 --> 02:12:25.280]   - Yeah.
[02:12:25.280 --> 02:12:26.480]   - Oh my gosh, I missed that.
[02:12:26.480 --> 02:12:27.440]   - Yeah, these are good people.
[02:12:27.440 --> 02:12:29.120]   - I'm raised up over those panic people.
[02:12:29.120 --> 02:12:30.640]   - I think after the Goose game, they said,
[02:12:30.640 --> 02:12:35.520]   "You know what, we really need is a game machine with a crank on it."
[02:12:35.520 --> 02:12:38.880]   - Well, it's a big, I mean, how do you think I got it to Tamagotchi?
[02:12:38.880 --> 02:12:40.480]   It's like a really big thing right now,
[02:12:40.480 --> 02:12:43.840]   just to have these sort of little handhelds,
[02:12:43.840 --> 02:12:45.600]   little desk toys, like these things.
[02:12:45.600 --> 02:12:46.080]   They're really...
[02:12:46.080 --> 02:12:48.720]   They never go away.
[02:12:48.720 --> 02:12:50.320]   Adults like their toys too, darn it.
[02:12:50.320 --> 02:12:52.960]   - Apparently the crank is in some way
[02:12:52.960 --> 02:12:54.800]   intimately connected with the gameplay.
[02:12:54.800 --> 02:12:55.280]   - Yeah.
[02:12:55.280 --> 02:12:56.000]   - Yes.
[02:12:56.000 --> 02:12:57.360]   - It doesn't like charge it or something.
[02:12:57.360 --> 02:12:57.680]   - Yeah.
[02:12:57.680 --> 02:13:01.120]   - No, no, no, it's like, as you turn things happen.
[02:13:01.120 --> 02:13:03.040]   - Tour it gun.
[02:13:03.040 --> 02:13:06.720]   Fishing.
[02:13:06.720 --> 02:13:07.360]   - All right.
[02:13:07.360 --> 02:13:07.840]   All right.
[02:13:07.840 --> 02:13:12.240]   So next week, next week, we'll either be talking about two new Apple laptops
[02:13:12.240 --> 02:13:14.640]   or a game console with a crank on it.
[02:13:14.640 --> 02:13:16.560]   One or the other, maybe both, maybe all of them.
[02:13:16.560 --> 02:13:17.200]   I don't know.
[02:13:17.200 --> 02:13:18.880]   - Game console with the crank on it.
[02:13:18.880 --> 02:13:19.920]   - Oh, let's turn the sound on.
[02:13:19.920 --> 02:13:21.200]   What does it sound like?
[02:13:22.080 --> 02:13:24.080]   (squeaking)
[02:13:24.080 --> 02:13:24.480]   - Okay.
[02:13:24.480 --> 02:13:27.520]   And on that note, or notes,
[02:13:27.520 --> 02:13:30.320]   I bid you a fun farewell.
[02:13:30.320 --> 02:13:32.240]   We do Twitter every Sunday afternoon.
[02:13:32.240 --> 02:13:35.520]   230 Pacific, 530 Eastern.
[02:13:35.520 --> 02:13:36.960]   That's 2,130 UTC.
[02:13:36.960 --> 02:13:38.560]   You can watch the live stream.
[02:13:38.560 --> 02:13:40.560]   It's free at TV slash live.
[02:13:40.560 --> 02:13:43.600]   Do turn in early, not turn in early,
[02:13:43.600 --> 02:13:47.360]   tune in early because you won't want to miss the pre and post shows.
[02:13:47.360 --> 02:13:48.320]   Those are always fun.
[02:13:49.120 --> 02:13:53.280]   If you're watching live chat live, I-R-C dot twit dot TV.
[02:13:53.280 --> 02:13:57.920]   We also have the great Twit forums available for people to watch after the fact.
[02:13:57.920 --> 02:14:01.600]   Twit dot community, the Twit Mastinon at Twit dot social.

[02:14:06.480 --> 02:14:09.680]   available on our website, twit dot TV.
[02:14:09.680 --> 02:14:14.800]   But you can also find there's a YouTube channel for every show that we do on the network.

[02:14:24.880 --> 02:14:27.360]   All you have to do is click the button or get the link.
[02:14:27.360 --> 02:14:30.560]   And by the way, if they allow reviews on your podcast client,
[02:14:30.560 --> 02:14:33.600]   please leave us a five star review helped spread the word.
[02:14:33.600 --> 02:14:37.520]   Not everybody, amazingly enough, knows about this show.
[02:14:37.520 --> 02:14:40.880]   One of the, I think one of the longest continuous running podcasts in the world.
[02:14:40.880 --> 02:14:44.720]   I mean, pretty much 14 years, right?
[02:14:44.720 --> 02:14:47.280]   No, 16 years.
[02:14:48.160 --> 02:14:49.680]   That's a long time.
[02:14:49.680 --> 02:14:51.440]   Joe Rogan's got nothing on you, Leo.
[02:14:51.440 --> 02:14:54.640]   There's, there's teenagers younger than this show.
[02:14:54.640 --> 02:14:58.080]   Sorry, but you know Joe Rogan is on one good thing in this news radio.
[02:14:58.080 --> 02:15:01.440]   Joe, Joe Rogan, Joe Rogan.
[02:15:01.440 --> 02:15:01.920]   Joe Rogan.
[02:15:01.920 --> 02:15:02.800]   He's got nothing on you.
[02:15:02.800 --> 02:15:03.680]   He was a news radio.
[02:15:03.680 --> 02:15:03.920]   Yeah.
[02:15:03.920 --> 02:15:05.120]   He was a good show and Phil Hartman.
[02:15:05.120 --> 02:15:06.320]   Was he on the man show too?
[02:15:06.320 --> 02:15:07.840]   I think he was on the man show.
[02:15:07.840 --> 02:15:08.880]   He seems like he was probably trampling.
[02:15:08.880 --> 02:15:12.560]   He seems like he be buddy buddy with Adam Frolla and Dr. Drew.
[02:15:12.560 --> 02:15:12.560]   Yeah.
[02:15:12.560 --> 02:15:14.720]   I was here first.
[02:15:14.720 --> 02:15:15.360]   I just say.
[02:15:15.360 --> 02:15:15.760]   Yeah.
[02:15:17.200 --> 02:15:18.000]   Yeah.
[02:15:18.000 --> 02:15:23.360]   I've been saying there's another twit in the can for a long, long time and I'm going to say it again
[02:15:23.360 --> 02:15:23.680]   right now.
[02:15:23.680 --> 02:15:25.040]   Thanks for being here.
[02:15:25.040 --> 02:15:25.840]   Another twit.
[02:15:25.840 --> 02:15:26.640]   It's in the can.
[02:15:26.640 --> 02:15:38.700]   See you guys later.
