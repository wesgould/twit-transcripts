[00:02:50.040 --> 00:02:57.120]   Yes, and no, I don't actually have employment per se. I have missions. They send me off to do things
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.480]   I might all IT array related. Yes, yes, mostly
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.480]   Yes, although we were talking about going to Antarctica because there's a chapel Catholic Chapel in Antarctica that you could go and become the

[00:03:12.400 --> 00:03:15.680]   I'll have an office and I'll say I come visit you have an extra cut
[00:03:15.680 --> 00:03:19.440]   You know, I'm not really sure I know it burned down once. Oh dear. No, it's burned down twice
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:24.840]   Oh dear, but they make it better every time so I'm hoping it burns down a few more time before I get there fully upgraded
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:26.960]   You don't need air conditioning, but he maybe
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:32.800]   Well, it's good to have you Robert Robert. We'll be the host starting in July of our new IT show

[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.440]   Yep, and they're putting sensors and stuff
[00:03:57.440 --> 00:04:03.600]   Yeah, these little sensors that do all sorts of things like measure temperature or water or pressure
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:07.640]   You know make your fears going on in San Mateo. That's why they came to my house last night
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:10.920]   And that's why I'm wearing the shirt. I didn't know they were gonna be here better
[00:04:10.920 --> 00:04:13.920]   I saw your post with this is one of the things about Robert
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:19.960]   He does nothing and you know quietly and anonymously. I saw your post about the you should see what we've got set up at the house
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.680]   I'll find out about more about that later. That sounds interesting. Yeah, W O V Y N
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:31.840]   Also joining us it's correct pot ladies and gentlemen from the no agenda podcast no agenda show calm Adam Curry
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:38.320]   In his Austin studio Adam. We're so glad to have you. Oh, it's good to be here once every two years Leo

[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:47.080]   No, no, no, no, that's not a good idea. We've never even been saying in the same picture
[00:04:47.080 --> 00:04:51.440]   Keep it that way. I have a name for a Padre show though. What's that?
[00:04:51.440 --> 00:04:53.840]   Briar Tech
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:59.620]   It's done and we'll give the pot father credit. It's done
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:08.240]   Briar Tech. I like it. It's at least his nickname. That's fantastic Adam is of course very well known as
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:12.720]   Podcaster today, but the proto podcaster. In fact, some called him the pod father
[00:05:12.720 --> 00:05:17.320]   He did one of the very first podcasts the daily source code is it is it is the daily source code dead?
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.840]   It's not dead. I
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.640]   Kind of went on a hiatus not daily show two weeks ago
[00:05:22.640 --> 00:05:25.920]   I was I don't watch a lot of television anymore
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:31.880]   But I was watching American Idol and they had like they were doing 45 seconds of Queen songs
[00:05:31.880 --> 00:05:35.480]   I got so frustrated. I got really drunk and then decided to do a show and
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:40.520]   And it turned out pretty good actually it's changed a lot since its inception
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:47.560]   So yeah, they're probably another one in a week or so. It's it's always evolved this episode 864 now
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:52.920]   So it's it's been around it inspired me and I think a lot of other people to do podcasts because I thought wow
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:57.560]   It's just a guy talking about his life and it's compelling and this is exciting
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:02.240]   And this is this is what a new medium should be something different and original but authentic
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.280]   Well, and this baby back at you
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:10.760]   I mean we have you know different models and doing different things with both of us, you know with twit the whole twit network
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:15.560]   It's all pretty much independent. Honestly, you know, I'm so busy with no agenda, which is
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:19.000]   Pretty much twice a week, you know two and a half hours
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:26.000]   There's just a lot of prep that goes into that and I'm very happy to be doing that just about the only thing
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   I do really for those not watching a video
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:35.320]   Adam is wearing a t-shirt that says that has a barcode and says slave on it. Yes. What is the barcode?
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:39.400]   I'm what is nothing but a slave just living the American dream of getting by
[00:06:39.400 --> 00:06:41.920]   He's a slave to the barcode
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:46.240]   We could put a sensor in his head and then he'd be a slave to the RFID as well
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:52.440]   You should try and scan me with your we're scared everybody okay. Let's get a nice clear shot of the I don't know if it'll work
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.700]   What does it say do you know it should take you to know agenda show?
[00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:02.160]   Plug yet
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:05.160]   Good lord, he's wearing a barcode to the show
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:10.760]   Holy cow always are our official show t-shirts well played sir
[00:07:10.760 --> 00:07:15.740]   But it's good to be on I'm happy. It's great. It's really great to have you
[00:07:16.220 --> 00:07:19.820]   Adam I was that flip board this this week which just announced audio
[00:07:19.820 --> 00:07:24.260]   From soundcloud in there and I was totally thinking about you. Give us a demo of that
[00:07:24.260 --> 00:07:28.260]   Do we have a yeah over the shoulder shot a Chad for this camera?
[00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:34.580]   Because this is actually pretty exciting and it actually has inspired me to completely change our model
[00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:42.100]   So flip board the new flip board if you click the ribbon on the right has audio as an audio entry now and
[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:45.180]   Among twists on there. You don't have to actually
[00:07:45.500 --> 00:07:47.500]   What are you looking for I'm curry?
[00:07:47.500 --> 00:07:50.220]   Because is no agenda show on there
[00:07:50.220 --> 00:07:54.540]   So you can you sound cloud so you can now there is you can add
[00:07:54.540 --> 00:07:57.180]   shows by RSS
[00:07:57.180 --> 00:08:01.900]   Yeah, but they also have an audio entry and if you actually go back if you would go back to the
[00:08:01.900 --> 00:08:07.940]   Go back to the audio. What's this split keyboard Robert? That's pretty bad. That's that's part of iOS
[00:08:07.940 --> 00:08:12.460]   Whatever nobody knows about it. Yeah, you can
[00:08:12.460 --> 00:08:15.500]   So click the Twitter icon you found it's in the audio entry
[00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:18.340]   There it is right at the top
[00:08:18.340 --> 00:08:23.120]   So you can look at flip on on a flip board you can look at all sorts of different
[00:08:23.120 --> 00:08:25.780]   But but but well here's what I wanted to make a point
[00:08:25.780 --> 00:08:31.620]   So click click the twit or just go to audio and scroll down. It's an alphabetical order. So this is what our podcast
[00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:35.460]   Flipboard because
[00:08:35.460 --> 00:08:41.660]   It's not a magazine. It's just audio so you you don't have to play it. I think people are listening
[00:08:41.660 --> 00:08:45.740]   What I so I'm playing it now and now I can go back to
[00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:52.300]   It's playing in the background and you continue to surf though or flip right so I go to my usual
[00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:55.100]   So that's what I've been doing but now go to NPR
[00:08:55.100 --> 00:09:01.260]   Because I want to show you what what it should look like so you see ours is just icons with each show well
[00:09:01.260 --> 00:09:04.340]   And it's playing in the background playing in the background if you go to NPR
[00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:07.500]   Which is one of the featured audio podcast
[00:09:08.140 --> 00:09:14.540]   By this little red red ribbon. Yeah red ribbon and there's an audio entry. Yeah, it looks very complicated
[00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:19.260]   Well, it's well. Here's my no. This is not he Roberts not doing it right
[00:09:19.260 --> 00:09:26.220]   I don't know what you're doing Robert. Just cancel cancel cancel cancel cancel there it is cancel cancel go back
[00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:30.140]   Okay, it's a feature to do the you do the thing you click audio. It's right at the top
[00:09:30.140 --> 00:09:32.300]   But you don't have to search for it there it is now
[00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:37.980]   What's different about NPR is because they have all this textual content Robert and uh?
[00:09:38.060 --> 00:09:40.060]   Adam, this is the lesson I learned
[00:09:40.060 --> 00:09:43.580]   I don't know why I clicked on that
[00:09:43.580 --> 00:09:49.420]   But look there's an audio right here that you start listening right yeah, and it's a web page
[00:09:49.420 --> 00:09:50.860]   It's a web page
[00:09:50.860 --> 00:09:57.820]   But this is the point is that this is I think the future of audio and probably video. Yeah, can you tie?
[00:09:57.820 --> 00:10:02.460]   Um an RSS feed with podcasts and connect it to
[00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:05.340]   Like show notes or something and have that well
[00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:09.500]   That's what I have to investigate because as you see if you scroll down, I mean most of these guys have
[00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:15.260]   Little magazines, but if you don't this is what you're gonna get you're gonna get what I do and what others do
[00:10:15.260 --> 00:10:17.260]   Which is just basically icons
[00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:21.980]   That show you shows in our case since every show has the same album art
[00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:28.780]   It's a very boring visual presentation. So what I don't you guys have different album art each time no
[00:10:28.780 --> 00:10:34.700]   Hmm. No, it's too complicated. Oh, man. We had we do it album art every single episode. Yeah. Yeah, I'm proud
[00:10:34.780 --> 00:10:37.900]   But even then all I would get is is what I see here, which is
[00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:43.820]   uh different album art each time, but it's still not very compelling and I think that this is the message
[00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:47.660]   Uh is that what's gonna happen is pot pot
[00:10:47.660 --> 00:10:50.540]   You're the pot father
[00:10:50.540 --> 00:10:55.420]   Both of us were early on in podcasting was a great thing, but just too hard for normal people
[00:10:55.420 --> 00:10:57.420]   I mean we've we've hit a ceiling with
[00:10:57.420 --> 00:11:02.620]   Uh normal people subscribing and listening to podcast. It has to somehow be more integrated in your normal life
[00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:09.180]   Yeah, you know with the genesis of podcasting goes back to the days when we had broadband, but it was always on
[00:11:09.180 --> 00:11:13.260]   And it wasn't very fast. You couldn't click something. I have it play immediately
[00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:16.540]   Right. Um, so that's why the subscription model made a lot of sense
[00:11:16.540 --> 00:11:22.060]   And these days, I mean you go in the car even on 3g you can just click something and it's nice playing
[00:11:22.060 --> 00:11:24.380]   And and I think that now of course
[00:11:24.380 --> 00:11:27.020]   Flipboards done this very nicely, but it's not going to be the only way to do it
[00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:31.420]   But I think flip board points the way to the future of multimedia content
[00:11:31.900 --> 00:11:34.620]   Which is you're right. We're online everywhere
[00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:37.020]   Yeah, uh, we have high speed everywhere
[00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:42.940]   So everything it needs to be kind of an on off switch where you say oh, yeah, I want to start listening right now
[00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:49.260]   But as but as like a radio, you know, it's a radio. Socks is a radio. It doesn't look that's not handy
[00:11:49.260 --> 00:11:52.860]   Yeah, what do you want buttons five buttons in front? I mean in
[00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:57.580]   Track in facebook it in facebook. It shows the same thing my soundcloud
[00:11:58.140 --> 00:12:03.820]   Channel and uh people can just click you've been using spreaker lately, which is kind of an interesting iphone app
[00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:06.540]   Although last night I just used the soundcloud app because I would go directly
[00:12:06.540 --> 00:12:11.500]   And i've been using audio boo, which is very similar audio boo makes an rss feed that I it becomes an itunes
[00:12:11.500 --> 00:12:15.580]   Yeah, feed so it's easy to make podcasts look at google hangouts now
[00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:19.180]   If you have a google account google plus account and you do a hangout
[00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:25.900]   Uh, you and you use google live. It's automatically a youtube download. It's people can watch live you're broadcasting
[00:12:26.140 --> 00:12:29.980]   You're a television broadcaster. I mean this has really changed since you started an mtv
[00:12:29.980 --> 00:12:35.660]   Uh 20 years ago. Yeah. Yeah. Well back then leo as you as you remember
[00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:39.740]   Even the advertisers would be like it's not television. It's cable
[00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:43.420]   It's disgusting
[00:12:43.420 --> 00:12:45.580]   It's not gonna be anything
[00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:48.220]   That's why i miss tell that to mentos
[00:12:48.220 --> 00:12:52.780]   The relationship that tweeze to have with media skills because they skittled they used to put you in front of everything
[00:12:52.860 --> 00:12:56.860]   I mean they they got your roku app and they would put you on tv's and in the xbox
[00:12:56.860 --> 00:13:00.380]   Uh, yeah, I'd love to see more twit podcasts with audio
[00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:05.660]   Transcriptions because then then you actually have written content to put next to sell we I think we want to take the next step
[00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:09.180]   Uh, and i've been talking with some people and I think what we're going to do and it's going to take us a while
[00:13:09.180 --> 00:13:13.420]   And i'm not supposed to talk about it, but I do think that we're going to have to make it more of a magazine
[00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:17.020]   More uh textual plus and I don't think show notes are enough
[00:13:17.020 --> 00:13:20.620]   I think it has to be we have to have more editorial that ties back to the audio
[00:13:20.620 --> 00:13:24.780]   We have to think of ourselves as multimedia artists not just audio not just video
[00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:32.300]   But audio video and text in a form that can be consumed on flip board on any platform. Yep, that's really hard
[00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:37.100]   I mean we it is show notes and you know, it's just it's hundreds of links for every
[00:13:37.100 --> 00:13:42.540]   Every episode we do but for you, you know with with this type of format you literally need someone
[00:13:42.540 --> 00:13:47.980]   Uh, we have to build an editorial style long and collecting links and then publishing it. Yeah, it's a lot of work
[00:13:49.100 --> 00:13:53.420]   And flip board is trying to do that by taking your tweet and making it a
[00:13:53.420 --> 00:13:57.820]   Lay. Dot magazine. I mean this whole thing was created by one tweet
[00:13:57.820 --> 00:14:00.620]   Right. This is roberts twitter feed. So in effect
[00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:04.540]   It pulls the links that you link to and makes articles out of them
[00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:05.820]   Right, um
[00:14:05.820 --> 00:14:12.060]   I think that the key is to start thinking of yourself as a multimedia creator not an audio guy or video guy or a text guy
[00:14:12.060 --> 00:14:16.780]   But a multimedia creator and we need to as a network be a multimedia network
[00:14:16.860 --> 00:14:22.220]   Not a audio or a video network, but a multimedia network and that does mean that it means expense because you have to hire staff
[00:14:22.220 --> 00:14:24.300]   Means editorial, you know roku
[00:14:24.300 --> 00:14:27.500]   We're very close now to this roku streaming stick
[00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:32.780]   And this is very interesting. Just have you seen this? This is a we started ces. This is a usb
[00:14:32.780 --> 00:14:35.500]   It's a little bigger than the thumb drive
[00:14:35.500 --> 00:14:41.900]   That you plug into you need a special kind of hdmi port which are which are increasingly available called an mh
[00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:47.820]   Elport I have one on my new av receiver. I plugged that roku to the usb port. That's a roku box
[00:14:47.820 --> 00:14:54.300]   And so it's very awesome. I I mean I I have a the old 79 dollar version roku
[00:14:54.300 --> 00:14:56.380]   But I can't live without it. No, I love it
[00:14:56.380 --> 00:15:01.660]   So imagine that instead of and I see samsung and lg and everybody building smart apps and the tv and their crap
[00:15:01.660 --> 00:15:04.220]   Yep, because these people have no experience with user interface
[00:15:04.220 --> 00:15:08.300]   Not only that I just don't believe in poking at a tv. That's across the room
[00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:15.180]   This is going to be my so you think the ipad with airplay might become the way you start consuming or something like that, you know
[00:15:15.180 --> 00:15:21.260]   It's a very interesting world and and so as a content creator and all of us are content creators
[00:15:21.260 --> 00:15:25.580]   We have to start thinking about how our how our users consume us
[00:15:25.580 --> 00:15:28.460]   And what's the best way to reach them right isn't that our job?
[00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:31.100]   How do we reach them?
[00:15:31.100 --> 00:15:33.580]   Fascinating times so the new model is the old model
[00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:37.500]   And the old is the new and what's new is old and I need my clipboard
[00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:41.900]   So could somebody go get it for me because this would be a good time for a commercial, but I have no idea
[00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:45.820]   What to say slavery? I think that's from ecclesiastes
[00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:50.300]   For everything there is a purpose up is down
[00:15:50.300 --> 00:15:54.300]   and and a time for every
[00:15:54.300 --> 00:15:57.420]   commercial under heaven
[00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:01.180]   Uh, this time to take a break. We're going to come back. I do want to talk about the facebook ipo
[00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:06.140]   That's the reason we've gathered you all together today because uh and and the zuck got married
[00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:11.420]   I guess prozilla chan who's been dating since before facebook has since a freshman in harvard
[00:16:11.420 --> 00:16:17.740]   Priscilla finally said oh you're worth 19 billion. I'll marry you no problem mark
[00:16:17.740 --> 00:16:21.740]   Well, they wait they waited to the day after the ipo
[00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:24.140]   How about this?
[00:16:24.140 --> 00:16:28.060]   Oh, man. We got to do something to distract from that failed ipo
[00:16:28.060 --> 00:16:30.060]   So
[00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:35.740]   How do you make some headlines? I want to fill a ipo that's worth 105 billion
[00:16:35.740 --> 00:16:36.700]   Let's talk
[00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:41.180]   That's the headline already zuck. It's going to be zuckaberg changes his status to married
[00:16:41.180 --> 00:16:44.060]   It's an interesting question. Is it a failed ipo?
[00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:47.580]   It's uh, it's it will talk about it in just a second the facebook ipo
[00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:50.940]   And here it is the lovely vision of mark
[00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:56.860]   The 19 billion dollar man and his new bride Priscilla chan. They got married yesterday in a surprise
[00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:00.140]   They invited people to the wedding and said it was a uh, what was it?
[00:17:00.140 --> 00:17:05.900]   It was like her grad graduation, uh party. Yep. And then instead she shows up in white
[00:17:05.900 --> 00:17:09.260]   She's graduating from spinsterhood

[00:19:43.180 --> 00:19:44.460]   so
[00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:49.020]   Intra really interesting here you say a facebook failed ipo adam and i'm not sure I disagree with you
[00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:55.900]   Uh the underwriters decided to set the price before the ipo yesterday morning at $38 that was the dot
[00:19:55.900 --> 00:19:57.740]   That was the price that if you were
[00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:59.340]   an insider
[00:19:59.340 --> 00:20:02.300]   Like you were a big trader with your brokerage you could say hey
[00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:05.500]   Cut me some of that facebook stock and you know
[00:20:05.500 --> 00:20:07.980]   It's the biggest tech ipo in history
[00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:12.940]   It wouldn't be unreasonable to think it's gonna what they call pop which is come out at 38 bucks
[00:20:12.940 --> 00:20:15.660]   But end up at 100 bucks or 50 bucks or whatever
[00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:20.620]   And then even if you just wanted to sell at the end of the day you'd make pretty good money
[00:20:20.620 --> 00:20:23.660]   So I took my company public in
[00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:26.300]   '96 oh you've done this yeah, I have
[00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:32.940]   Uh and that was a huge ipo a big raise 15 million dollars. It was amazingly large
[00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:35.500]   Um was this metaverse?
[00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:37.820]   No, this was think new ideas
[00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:39.180]   Oh, okay
[00:20:39.260 --> 00:20:45.500]   And which we later sold successfully to another public illicit company like two months before the bubble birth
[00:20:45.500 --> 00:20:47.260]   You were in the bubble you were in the bubble
[00:20:47.260 --> 00:20:52.620]   Well, 96 was a little bit before it and you know, we had uh, we were making money which was good
[00:20:52.620 --> 00:20:59.020]   We had clients, but it was you know, it was back in the day when uh, we'll build a reebox website for a hundred thousand dollars
[00:20:59.020 --> 00:21:02.540]   I mean, yeah, and then ten thousand dollars a month maintenance. Yeah, this is you know
[00:21:02.540 --> 00:21:07.020]   We saw the the writing on the wall eventually, but I went through the process
[00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:10.620]   of taking a company public and what it really comes down to
[00:21:10.620 --> 00:21:13.260]   um is pricing
[00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.500]   the the night before and
[00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:21.740]   Uh, so it's the size of the float the number of shares and what the what the actual price per share is going to be
[00:21:21.740 --> 00:21:27.100]   And I think they got greedy and uh when investors and of course there was a lot of more interesting to me
[00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:31.340]   Was the coverage of the ipo because you saw the day before gm
[00:21:31.340 --> 00:21:33.260]   Super bowl
[00:21:33.260 --> 00:21:37.580]   Yeah, and then we're gm tankton. Yeah. Yeah. Well, I think it had to do with
[00:21:37.740 --> 00:21:39.740]   But if you look at right now, they're trading
[00:21:39.740 --> 00:21:42.780]   74 almost 75 times earnings
[00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:48.780]   And that's very very high. I mean, I'm I'm pegging this stock to go down to 17. That's where I think it belongs
[00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:53.020]   I think that's reasonable for what they can do what they've shown historically
[00:21:53.020 --> 00:21:57.180]   Uh in revenues and and profits. So that's the problem
[00:21:57.180 --> 00:22:00.620]   You know, I was watching it was really treated like the super balls
[00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:04.780]   I got up at 5 30 a.m to watch cnbc because it was like a big event
[00:22:04.780 --> 00:22:08.540]   They had reporters down at hacker square at the facebook thing
[00:22:08.540 --> 00:22:12.140]   And of course facebook was smart. They had the hackathon the night before so there were
[00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:14.780]   Thousands of employees there zuck spoke
[00:22:14.780 --> 00:22:20.780]   They had they hooked up the nazdak bell there in silicon valley so he could press the there's no bell for nazdak
[00:22:20.780 --> 00:22:23.980]   It doesn't have a trading floor, but he pressed the button to start the trading day
[00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:26.540]   And um, then it took another half an hour
[00:22:26.540 --> 00:22:32.380]   And then a little later they started so here's a problem with these ipos and I saw and yes
[00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:37.420]   I saw this in the bubble so you have people um who came in to the company
[00:22:37.420 --> 00:22:42.540]   Recently they're getting options their strike price is going to be maybe a little bit under 38
[00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:47.820]   Any new hires that come in you can't just reshuffle the option pool. That's a big deal
[00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:51.980]   They have a strike price and let's say just for argument sake. It's going to be around that 38 number
[00:22:51.980 --> 00:22:58.220]   So now people are going to be very worried like, oh, you know, either I have stock or i'm in lockup for six months
[00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:02.620]   I can't sell anything so on paper. I may look like I have a million dollars
[00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:06.220]   But every day it's gonna be like how's the stock doing how's that stock good?
[00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:12.780]   That's really what you don't want particularly when it's going down. It really really hurts the company and you know, that's what
[00:23:12.780 --> 00:23:14.860]   Facebook I think that's bs
[00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:17.980]   I you know at rax base when we went ipo the stock went down
[00:23:17.980 --> 00:23:23.420]   And it didn't distract us and the stock since then has gone up 10. I think about 10 times
[00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:25.180]   you know
[00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:26.780]   just
[00:23:26.780 --> 00:23:31.820]   To go out type yo you're trying to raise money for the company. Yeah, let me let me let me understand this
[00:23:31.820 --> 00:23:37.740]   So do this face perfectly 38 bucks. Does that that which is what they decided to set to sell it for?
[00:23:37.740 --> 00:23:42.540]   Does all of that money go to facebook? Is that like what so facebook said we're gonna have
[00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:45.420]   Uh, how many shares almost a million shares right at 38 bucks?
[00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:50.780]   I forgot what it was the total number shares well not not the not the entire amount because the insider soul so
[00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:54.700]   Uh a portion of that went to a large portion of course
[00:23:55.260 --> 00:23:59.100]   Went to the uh the people who sold the stock that's actually an important point
[00:23:59.100 --> 00:24:05.420]   Some of these guys are making money right away like they got a check all the underwriters made a ton of money
[00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:12.620]   Peter teal for instance who famously invested was the first investor facebook invested half a million ended up with 848 million
[00:24:12.620 --> 00:24:19.100]   Dollars on friday and he still has another 852 million shares a dollars worth of shares current at current price
[00:24:19.660 --> 00:24:24.060]   Remaining but this gives this is not made one and a half billion in cash right like that
[00:24:24.060 --> 00:24:28.540]   And he still has 19 billion outstanding if I could take a contrarian position here
[00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:33.660]   I mean, I know why people are saying this is a bust because they're they're expecting for the price to double
[00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:35.900]   It took to go back to the good old days of the bubble
[00:24:35.900 --> 00:24:42.140]   When you would have an incredible rise in the stock price and the IPO was when people get paid
[00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:44.860]   This is not a regular IPO
[00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:47.100]   You're talking about a company that is 57
[00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:49.660]   Owned by a single man
[00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:52.220]   All he wanted was operating capital for his company
[00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:56.060]   I don't think he even needed to do this. I think the SEC rules made him do this
[00:24:56.060 --> 00:25:00.460]   Uh, well at least they made him disclose to a certain point and I think they figured well as long as we have to
[00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:05.020]   Do all the disclosure a public company has to do we might as well raise money on the stock market
[00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:09.260]   But I don't think that this was I think they put it off as long as they could right they could have done this a year ago
[00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:13.180]   They could have done this two years ago partly partly that's hype because you don't think so
[00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:14.540]   I think mark didn't want to put it
[00:25:14.540 --> 00:25:17.660]   You know mark better than anybody. I think he put it off to raise the price
[00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:23.340]   He wanted to make as much as he could every minute that Facebook is out there the price risky game though
[00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:26.380]   It is a risky game because the price could also go down. It paid off
[00:25:26.380 --> 00:25:33.020]   He collected $104 billion on Friday for for his investors and his company now. I mean on friday night
[00:25:33.020 --> 00:25:37.420]   What did he do he went and bought a mobile company called karma, right? He's gonna have
[00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:41.660]   He's gonna have the resources to take over a lot of things
[00:25:42.140 --> 00:25:49.500]   And this is very good for Facebook. Also on the other side the transparency is gonna force Facebook to be an adult company for once
[00:25:49.500 --> 00:25:52.700]   I think that's what mark didn't want though. No, I think he does he did
[00:25:52.700 --> 00:25:56.860]   I think he does you know he knows he's moving his company into being a
[00:25:56.860 --> 00:26:02.780]   Brand that everybody respects and trusts that is no those two words are not used with Facebook today
[00:26:02.780 --> 00:26:07.740]   Well, in fact with gm pulling out it's 10 million dollars worth of advertising, which is not a huge amount
[00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:13.740]   GM pulled out of the Super Bowl 2 is the Super Bowl dead in fact, I think it's more of a common on gns inability to use these
[00:26:13.740 --> 00:26:19.500]   Markets appropriately than it is a comment on the use more interesting is though is
[00:26:19.500 --> 00:26:22.060]   How do they actually make money?
[00:26:22.060 --> 00:26:26.460]   If you have a so-called nine hundred million people which I don't believe is correct
[00:26:26.460 --> 00:26:30.860]   I think it's probably a fraction of that but really that's neither
[00:26:30.860 --> 00:26:35.100]   Yeah, I think that you know everyone has multiple accounts the seo guys have 50 accounts
[00:26:35.660 --> 00:26:39.340]   It's just a matter of how you count things but in the case of rack space, Robert
[00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:44.780]   That's a business for you providing a service and people pay for it. I have five rack space servers
[00:26:44.780 --> 00:26:48.460]   I I love the service out of them amazon s3 servers ec2
[00:26:48.460 --> 00:26:49.980]   but
[00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:53.340]   We have yet to show that you can really place a good value
[00:26:53.340 --> 00:26:59.180]   On essentially display banner advertising. That's all they've got so far and quite honestly
[00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:02.540]   For the company that knows so much about the social graph
[00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:08.700]   How could they not figure out that this IPO was mispriced? You know, they should have had all the information at their fingertips
[00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:10.140]   Was it mispriced though?
[00:27:10.140 --> 00:27:15.900]   They announced their $38 and it came out at $38 if they came out at 17 and went to 38
[00:27:15.900 --> 00:27:18.540]   They would have not left money on the table
[00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:22.700]   Though the purpose of doing an IPO is to raise money for your investor company
[00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:27.660]   You can't disagree Adam. They raised the most money that they possibly could have raised right because they
[00:27:28.540 --> 00:27:34.380]   It kept hitting 38 because the underwriters were buying stock like crazy to keep it to keep it above
[00:27:34.380 --> 00:27:36.380]   They kept it at 38 you think
[00:27:36.380 --> 00:27:38.380]   Okay on my day it'll go down and
[00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:40.620]   You know because they can't do that forever
[00:27:40.620 --> 00:27:47.020]   But they took the most amount of money off the table that they possibly could there was some should have been a 37 or 35
[00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:51.340]   Maybe but it's a 120 price to earnings ratio
[00:27:51.340 --> 00:27:54.460]   Is 122 this is not a normal life
[00:27:55.180 --> 00:28:00.140]   This is not a means that the stock price is 122 times what they earn
[00:28:00.140 --> 00:28:07.340]   That's crazy and one of the reasons and then I'm watching CNBC and Jim Kramer who was actually great on this
[00:28:07.340 --> 00:28:09.660]   And I was surprised because he's kind of seems like he's kind of crazy
[00:28:09.660 --> 00:28:14.780]   But but he was great on it. He said well what what you can't account for is what's going to happen with the retail sales
[00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:17.580]   You know the institutional investors pushed back about this price
[00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:23.020]   But there was some concern that everybody who has who loves all the kids who love facebook would just say
[00:28:23.340 --> 00:28:25.660]   Well, I don't know anything about the stock market or price to earnings
[00:28:25.660 --> 00:28:26.940]   But I'm want to buy facebook
[00:28:26.940 --> 00:28:32.460]   It's a good and would buy it and that's what the thought was that this would pop that would go up to 50 bucks
[00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:36.460]   Because and you know what the kids or whoever did not fall for this
[00:28:36.460 --> 00:28:40.380]   They looked somebody looked at the price or something and said it's too high
[00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:43.500]   It still is
[00:28:43.500 --> 00:28:47.980]   A billion dollars right now. It went up to 40. This is the largest IPO of history
[00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:50.300]   It's not a gm when they went out
[00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:54.700]   With the recent IP it was raised 30 more than city group. Yes
[00:28:54.700 --> 00:28:57.820]   It's worth more than these other companies really all right. Yes
[00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:01.340]   We look at facebook all day long we're addicted to it
[00:29:01.340 --> 00:29:04.620]   And we're gonna get more addicted, but I think how often do you click on an ad?
[00:29:04.620 --> 00:29:07.580]   I click on a lot of ads, but i'm playing around with it
[00:29:07.580 --> 00:29:10.300]   The ads that are gonna come are gonna be on mobile
[00:29:10.300 --> 00:29:14.540]   He's making them zero dollars on mobile right now and I can see a lot and by the way
[00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:17.500]   Some more than i bought a lot of stock. I don't own any stock in this company
[00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:19.820]   Oh, we should say right now any but who owns facebook stock here
[00:29:19.820 --> 00:29:25.500]   I don't own any I don't I can't afford it. Okay. So just so you know, I don't we don't buy tech
[00:29:25.500 --> 00:29:27.100]   I don't buy type stock over here by the summer
[00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:27.660]   Here by tech stock
[00:29:27.660 --> 00:29:34.060]   The the time really to buy for normal people to buy facebook is right after the google.io conference because that's gonna be where it gets
[00:29:34.060 --> 00:29:36.300]   Either gets slammed because google's gonna announce something
[00:29:36.300 --> 00:29:41.500]   Uh or it's gonna start rising or do whatever but at that point then that's where ras
[00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:47.980]   But how do you answer adam's criticism that facebook's revenue right now is banner ads display ads which don't want he's absolutely right
[00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:52.140]   But that's not the story right that's why he needs to click on ads
[00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:53.660]   So they can get more drunk people
[00:29:53.660 --> 00:29:55.660]   I don't think it's about clicking on ads anyways
[00:29:55.660 --> 00:29:58.540]   So when people are investing in facebook there's a presumption that well
[00:29:58.540 --> 00:29:59.340]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
[00:29:59.340 --> 00:30:02.620]   Zuck is this is the fundamentals this company are going to be good because zuck is smart
[00:30:02.620 --> 00:30:03.740]   He's gonna figure out mobile
[00:30:03.740 --> 00:30:08.140]   Coca-Cola owns a sign in downtown san francisco that costs i don't know 200,000 a month a month
[00:30:08.140 --> 00:30:09.900]   But they're selling sugar water
[00:30:09.900 --> 00:30:14.140]   But but why do they do that is it because you go up to the sign and click on it
[00:30:14.140 --> 00:30:17.820]   No, it's there on the side and it reminds you that coca-cola exists
[00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:20.860]   This is why advertising is done. This is why uh
[00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:25.180]   Stamps.com bought an ad on your show to remind people that they exist
[00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:29.260]   I mean one of the things is not all about clicks
[00:30:29.260 --> 00:30:30.940]   This is not a regular ipl
[00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:36.780]   Stamps.com is not necessarily branding part of his branding but it's also per inquiry
[00:30:36.780 --> 00:30:41.900]   So you're to be there's a call to action you need to either put in a code all the ads work that way
[00:30:41.900 --> 00:30:47.020]   I think the only brand advertiser is Ford possibly and they're making a connection with the
[00:30:47.580 --> 00:30:51.180]   With the tech savvy audience. It's not exactly the same and again
[00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:56.940]   Coca-Cola sells an actual product people take money out of their pocket and hand it to the company
[00:30:56.940 --> 00:31:02.860]   Yeah, this is the difference. I mean we've been through this we've seen the banner advertising
[00:31:02.860 --> 00:31:07.020]   It's marginal and how do you grow if you are if you really have 900 million people
[00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:12.460]   How do you scale how much bigger can you go all of a sudden you're gonna make five times as much from each person?
[00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:16.940]   Yes, because they're making zero on mobile and there's hundreds of millions of people
[00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:23.340]   Who only use Facebook on mobile, you know, all they have to make is a couple of bucks per user if maybe it's not 900
[00:31:23.340 --> 00:31:26.780]   Maybe it's not 900 million as you say Adam. Maybe it's let's say what would you stipulate?
[00:31:26.780 --> 00:31:30.780]   150 million 150 million so all they have to do is make 10 bucks
[00:31:30.780 --> 00:31:32.460]   per
[00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:37.740]   Person per year to justify their stock price. Yeah, could they do can you make 10 bucks per person per year?
[00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:43.100]   You can with the money that you just raised in the IPO. I mean again
[00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:47.260]   Spending that money acquisition that money in acquisitions and in development
[00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:49.020]   I mean one of the things that we keep forgetting is
[00:31:49.020 --> 00:31:57.100]   This is not a regular IPO if this had been another LinkedIn or if this had been another group on
[00:31:57.100 --> 00:32:02.460]   Absolutely, this was a bust but this was a man who by all means has done very well for his company
[00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:08.140]   Getting money for him to be able to invest news money so he can leverage those 900 million users
[00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:11.580]   So you're buying you're not buying stock at Facebook. You're buying stock in Mark Zuckerberg
[00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:17.740]   Well right right now. It's a rational. I totally agree with Adam that the price is completely crazy right now
[00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:20.940]   And it's crazy because we all use Facebook all day long
[00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:25.340]   By brands we buy stock at a minute that you're an outlier
[00:32:25.340 --> 00:32:28.140]   Um possibly
[00:32:28.140 --> 00:32:33.660]   Um, but I do have an account. I only use it to see what my daughter is doing and to terrorize her friends
[00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:36.940]   I love doing that. That's a lot of fun. It's terrorizing. It's not a bad response
[00:32:36.940 --> 00:32:42.060]   I could reason that you know people are saying no. We don't okay. I just was recently at Disney World
[00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:45.340]   And I walked around and I looked at what people were doing on their phones
[00:32:45.340 --> 00:32:51.900]   70 percent were on Facebook. Yeah, walking around people clearly use Facebook. There's no question about that
[00:32:51.900 --> 00:32:57.340]   I think when you buy Facebook internet, but yeah, yeah different people use google google's making money
[00:32:57.340 --> 00:33:01.100]   Google's a valuable stock. It's a 600 bucks. I don't think the pd is the same but
[00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:04.540]   So the question is can mark figure out a way?
[00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:08.380]   I think you're betting that mark will make some magic and figure out a way to make money on mobile
[00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:12.620]   And I don't think it's too you don't have to think too hard to think of a way or many ways you could make money
[00:33:12.620 --> 00:33:15.100]   And here's how here's how I'm looking at flip board
[00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:19.660]   I'm looking at a giga home article in flip board and when I page through this
[00:33:19.660 --> 00:33:25.980]   Whoa, there's a polycom ad a full page ad and that goes by the way not to flip board, but to giga home, right?
[00:33:25.980 --> 00:33:30.220]   Yes, that's a gig. Well giga home is sharing a revenue with flip board, right?
[00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:32.380]   And then you turn the page and you're back to giga home
[00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:37.100]   This is not ad work. Do you know what? I'll be honest. I just skip it real quick
[00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:42.300]   But these are ads like wired magazine has and is why don't think those work? I think those don't work
[00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:47.020]   They work enough for people to keep doing them and have been doing them for years
[00:33:47.020 --> 00:33:52.860]   Okay, I okay. I think we can agree the stock price was too high except faith not for facebook
[00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:56.140]   But for investors facebook was just right because they made a lot of money
[00:33:56.140 --> 00:34:04.060]   The question is next week. What's the stock price? What's your what's your target price adam for facebook in a week in a month in a year?
[00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:10.540]   Okay, I can give you the five month and five year scenario five months the stock is at 17 five years
[00:34:10.540 --> 00:34:14.380]   We're not talking about facebook anymore. It's something else not a long-term hold
[00:34:14.380 --> 00:34:21.100]   No, you're a short on facebook. We see leo. We've seen this movie. Look at what does aol become now?
[00:34:21.100 --> 00:34:27.900]   It's a giant Xerox machine run by area in a huffington. I mean we've seen geosydm i face
[00:34:27.900 --> 00:34:32.700]   Adam i'm exactly right out of the way. What a great characterization of aol
[00:34:33.980 --> 00:34:39.900]   Is it true? I think i think adam is correct on one of the predictions, which is short term. I see it going down
[00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:44.940]   Long term he is going to turn on mobile revenue and for the next five quarters
[00:34:44.940 --> 00:34:50.140]   He is going to beat his numbers and that is going to cause the stock to have left target price. This is what happens
[00:34:50.140 --> 00:34:57.100]   This is what happens and by the way, this is zuckerberg's brilliance zuckerberg knew we were all going to buy this stock coming out of the gate
[00:34:57.100 --> 00:34:59.340]   so he he
[00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:07.420]   Um, he he he stand back does he kept this revenue off the table until after he's been hiding his revenue
[00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:10.780]   He's been hiding the mobile revenue. He's been slow playing his hand
[00:35:10.780 --> 00:35:14.940]   You watch by the end of summer he got he's saying he's got five aces
[00:35:14.940 --> 00:35:19.580]   I think he's going to turn on this style of mobile advertising over the next couple of months
[00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:25.580]   And he's probably going to turn it on right during the google.io conference because google is going to come out with a bunch of stuff for google plus
[00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:30.380]   Slap him slap him around and announce a whole bunch of new things and announce a new open ground
[00:35:30.380 --> 00:35:32.460]   You know something we don't know or is speculations
[00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:35.180]   It's a little bit of speculation, but a little bit of informed
[00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:41.340]   Adam zess sounds right. I mean, sir. There's no everybody would agree that zuck is a sly devil
[00:35:41.340 --> 00:35:49.340]   Right. Well, I think he he he built a really great service and uh, and you know, thank you love. That's perfect perfect timing
[00:35:49.340 --> 00:35:51.980]   Did she bring you another fine?
[00:35:53.340 --> 00:35:57.500]   I needed that right about now. This is what I always love about daily service code by the way
[00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:01.580]   Wait until 30 minutes from now
[00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:07.820]   No, he built something great, but it's not part of the network and with the network. I mean the internet
[00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:14.140]   Um, I do not believe in the advertising banner click model. I think yeah, if you turn it on
[00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:20.700]   On on mobile sure, you know, people will miss click. Oh, sorry didn't mean to do that. Well, I why I clicked on it anyway
[00:36:21.020 --> 00:36:25.740]   I just don't see the the the model as something that really works anymore. I think it's you know
[00:36:25.740 --> 00:36:28.860]   The only way you can make money with banner advertising
[00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:35.100]   Uh, which is essentially what they do. I've looked at all the presentations of I follow it. I'm very interested
[00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:40.380]   Um is just high volume high high volume of lots of people someone who will be drunk
[00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:43.420]   Someone who will make a mistake some of them will be interested no doubt about it
[00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:47.260]   But early on brands were all sold on this how many likes
[00:36:48.060 --> 00:36:53.820]   A brand had and I know advertisers advertisers are very very smart agencies not so
[00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:58.380]   Agencies will celebrate with crap to the advertiser the advertiser at the end of the day go
[00:36:58.380 --> 00:37:03.180]   Hey, man. It's money or not. They're going to turn on investments very simple
[00:37:03.180 --> 00:37:09.900]   So are you are you saying are you saying that the the open free and open internet will return?
[00:37:09.900 --> 00:37:14.220]   Yes. Oh, yeah. Well, this this is the pendulum that always swings back and forth
[00:37:14.220 --> 00:37:16.780]   um, I think the internet
[00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:21.500]   If if the internet was meant it was not meant to be centralized. It wasn't built that way
[00:37:21.500 --> 00:37:27.660]   Um, I think we will see mom and pops. Uh, I hope we'll see mom and pops popping up again
[00:37:27.660 --> 00:37:34.540]   Uh who will provide email to a hundred people email services. They'll be you know little smaller cloud things
[00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:36.620]   I mean my goodness
[00:37:36.620 --> 00:37:42.700]   My fiance just moved to iCloud and you know that mail is not working and you know craps out
[00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:45.500]   I mean this is hard hard stuff and the more scale you have
[00:37:45.900 --> 00:37:49.580]   The harder it gets and if you do it in a smaller. I run my own mail server here at home
[00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:52.780]   Yeah, I got like three accounts on it. It's enough. It works
[00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:59.180]   Uh, so we're gonna have to go back to that and because of facebook's inherent closed nature. It's not a part of the network
[00:37:59.180 --> 00:38:05.660]   So, uh, we know that's why that's why the analogy to AOL is app because that was also a walled garden
[00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:09.180]   Yeah, that everybody used and thought many people thought it was the internet
[00:38:09.180 --> 00:38:13.260]   Except we haven't seen you know all my favorite apps
[00:38:13.420 --> 00:38:19.340]   Uh, you know, whether it be four square or spotify or um, how much money are they making Robert seriously?
[00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:25.580]   Well, this is where he's gonna turn on these new mobile ad network and i would talk about four square and talk about twitter
[00:38:25.580 --> 00:38:28.860]   That's not making somebody that's a bubble that we're in right now is that well
[00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:32.220]   This is location somehow going to turn a huge profit
[00:38:32.220 --> 00:38:36.780]   You can't have this many users telling you this much about themselves without making money on it
[00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:40.060]   Yeah, and the question is how and that that's the big
[00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:45.500]   64,000 dollar question. It's not what do you think? Robert? Robert was stuck out here in my field
[00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:52.620]   Well, I mean look I've been hearing the end of the walled garden since the the myes of a
[00:38:52.620 --> 00:38:56.220]   Keep coming back keeps coming back. We keep going to a larger walled garden
[00:38:56.220 --> 00:39:02.620]   Uh, now facebook is is not a myspace. We've already seen that, you know, but facebook has is yes right now
[00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:07.340]   They're not in my space. Yes. They're not in my space. There's tons of ads and it didn't work
[00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:12.860]   And what what Adam's talking about terrible terrible perfect. Yeah, it was only banner ads and banner ads died in my space
[00:39:12.860 --> 00:39:16.300]   But facebook has something else and i'm not bringing out the mystic zuck anymore
[00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:21.100]   I'm talking about it's it's gone beyond a critical mass where you have an ecosystem
[00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:25.820]   Where you have people who are willing to buy the brand not just the advertising in the site
[00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:27.900]   But the actual brand for facebook
[00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:30.620]   And I think you've given a man who again
[00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:36.940]   I think is a very intelligent a huge war chest that he can now go out and get what he needs to to get more money out of his
[00:39:37.340 --> 00:39:41.980]   900 million users without it just being banner advertising. I don't know what that's going to be yet
[00:39:41.980 --> 00:39:44.460]   I mean look look at flip board. This is my facebook feed
[00:39:44.460 --> 00:39:48.860]   It doesn't look like facebook, but it's my facebook feed and how does facebook monetize that?
[00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:50.940]   Well, they can buy flip board
[00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:56.860]   And then they can put those full page ads like giga home has right in there and they can have audio ads in sound cloud
[00:39:56.860 --> 00:40:00.700]   But but I think adam saying that that the display ads don't work
[00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:04.540]   I think they do otherwise wired magazine would not exist
[00:40:05.340 --> 00:40:09.100]   I think a lot of magazines that are gone a lot of magazines have disappeared
[00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:11.660]   But a lot of come come I mean when I go to
[00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:15.420]   What's your so many magazine circulation? What's it circulation?
[00:40:15.420 --> 00:40:18.380]   I don't think people do actually pay for the magazine. I don't think you're actually yeah
[00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:21.340]   I don't think you're using a very good example Robert. I hate to tell you
[00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:25.580]   I don't know if display ads work. I really think that's what the that's what's going on right now
[00:40:25.580 --> 00:40:27.820]   So is there gonna be uh
[00:40:27.820 --> 00:40:33.580]   There still is demand from advertisers to get in front of your face. Why did stamps.com just sponsor your show?
[00:40:33.580 --> 00:40:36.140]   Well, and I think adam makes a very good point stamps.com
[00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:41.260]   Calculates return on in on their investment very carefully
[00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:44.300]   It's a little harder for Ford because it's a brand builder
[00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:47.740]   But you're right and Ford even wants to do a lot of research
[00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:51.660]   They they're researching constantly to see if they're getting brand recognition
[00:40:51.660 --> 00:40:54.540]   So no company that's spending ad dollars
[00:40:54.540 --> 00:41:00.380]   And is intelligent is spending ad dollars into a vacuum. They're checking does this work does this produce results?
[00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:03.500]   One way or the other they're not and I think you're right adam
[00:41:03.500 --> 00:41:05.500]   I don't know if it's the agencies that are that smart
[00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:10.380]   But the advertisers whose actual money it is are very careful about where they're putting it
[00:41:10.380 --> 00:41:16.220]   And in fact, I think that's one of the reasons you're seeing of a real softening and banner ads right now. Aren't we display ads or down?
[00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:21.180]   It's horrible. I mean, what do you get for a click these days nothing any yeah
[00:41:21.180 --> 00:41:25.100]   So I think that and that's why advertisers are starting to demand
[00:41:25.100 --> 00:41:29.820]   Uh, you know acquisition cost per acquisition instead of cost per click or cost per impression
[00:41:30.060 --> 00:41:33.820]   They really want to make sure that they're getting their money's worth. Yeah
[00:41:33.820 --> 00:41:39.980]   So I I I don't I think it's a but this was all brought up before the IPO everybody said well
[00:41:39.980 --> 00:41:44.700]   Here's the negatives it could be another myspace everybody could vacate facebook because somebody else comes along
[00:41:44.700 --> 00:41:50.940]   It could they're they don't haven't shown that they know how to produce revenue and they certainly aren't producing enough revenue to justify that price right now
[00:41:50.940 --> 00:41:55.980]   It's clear people who bought facebook and by the way, I I would buy it if I could
[00:41:56.940 --> 00:42:02.540]   Believe in zuck and believe in him and his team and his ability to somehow turn 900 million
[00:42:02.540 --> 00:42:08.940]   Well and the users we can say if it's adam's case 900 million eyeballs and they're leaving in their own use
[00:42:08.940 --> 00:42:11.820]   Into something they're believing in their own usage model. They're staring
[00:42:11.820 --> 00:42:16.300]   Well, you know that that was the that was the dumb retail buyers that jim kramer is worried about people who said well
[00:42:16.300 --> 00:42:20.620]   I like facebook. I like mcdonald's i'll buy their stock without even thinking is this a good is this a good value
[00:42:20.620 --> 00:42:26.220]   Because that's the question is yeah, you may like maz you may like mazarati, but is it a million dollar car?
[00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:32.700]   Facebook's selling a million dollar car here, right? Is that what we're saying adam that this is just overpriced
[00:42:32.700 --> 00:42:36.380]   Well, if it was a car that would do something for me
[00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:44.540]   Now selling a sticker up there we can now I can really bite on you facebook does do something for you
[00:42:44.540 --> 00:42:50.460]   Yeah, you know and this helps you get laid if nothing else now facebook is a no i'm sorry father
[00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:52.540]   Please forgive me. I thought that was Craigslist
[00:42:52.540 --> 00:42:54.540]   Craigslist
[00:42:54.540 --> 00:42:59.180]   And informed
[00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:01.180]   Confession
[00:43:01.180 --> 00:43:07.820]   Facebook is a new media company where the media comes to you based on who you are the yahoo is the old media company
[00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:13.660]   You had to go to yahoo.com/sports or yahoo.com. It was a portal that was the portal model and facebook
[00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:16.540]   You just sit here and it comes. I mean it's been coming to me during this show
[00:43:16.540 --> 00:43:22.140]   Media comes to me and the reason i told him to climb on during the show was that
[00:43:22.540 --> 00:43:27.100]   How many ads did you click on during the show? I I haven't clicked on anything. I'm just watching it
[00:43:27.100 --> 00:43:29.100]   There's a rise in fiosad right?
[00:43:29.100 --> 00:43:35.740]   I wish I wish I could click on that rise in fiosad and buy fios at my house, but they don't serve it in my house yet
[00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:41.260]   Yeah, I really I you know, I like the idea that people are using facebook, you know, that
[00:43:41.260 --> 00:43:43.340]   I think the
[00:43:43.340 --> 00:43:47.820]   Ability to find people and to have an address book of people online
[00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:53.420]   That that's the real magic sauce that facebook provided and now people are doing pretty much what they always do, you know
[00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:56.780]   Post funny pictures quote of the day. Here's my plate of food
[00:43:56.780 --> 00:44:03.020]   You need you really need to come and spend a couple hours with me and see what's on my screen because I have none of that stuff on my screen
[00:44:03.020 --> 00:44:08.060]   You know what we need to get we need to get benha in here because if he can turn i can has cheeseburger
[00:44:08.060 --> 00:44:10.060]   into money
[00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:12.940]   Then facebook can turn its sites into money, right?
[00:44:13.500 --> 00:44:18.060]   So there's a high high high volume business right very high volume
[00:44:18.060 --> 00:44:22.060]   Yep, lots of with extreme virality completely open by the way
[00:44:22.060 --> 00:44:28.060]   You you don't need an account to take a look at it and I don't know what he's doing. I don't know how much he's making
[00:44:28.060 --> 00:44:32.620]   I'm sure he's making enough for his company and for himself and I think there's there's validity in that
[00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:36.620]   You know, leo you're doing extremely well with the twit network
[00:44:36.620 --> 00:44:41.580]   But I don't think you actually believe you can scale it to a billion dollar company
[00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:44.380]   Oh, no, nor would you want to necessarily?
[00:44:44.380 --> 00:44:49.260]   And that that I think is you know, there's a couple things going on here
[00:44:49.260 --> 00:44:55.340]   Um that are very exciting to me if you look at kickstarter. There's a very interesting model
[00:44:55.340 --> 00:44:58.220]   Um, where you have a company that's facilitating
[00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:04.380]   The connection of people and is taking a piece of the action and people are getting what they want
[00:45:04.380 --> 00:45:08.060]   And this this is really the future and I think the network itself was going to
[00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:14.540]   Going to facilitate that tremendously where I want a product. I want, um, oh there you go
[00:45:14.540 --> 00:45:20.780]   So there's a million dollars on the pebble watch. Yeah, so you want it and you know, it's going to cost $2.99 when it comes out
[00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:24.860]   But you know what I want it so bad. Okay, I'll toss these guys 50 bucks to get it going
[00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:27.020]   This is an incredibly interesting model
[00:45:27.020 --> 00:45:33.500]   This is going to kill hollywood and every other industry is people users actually saying I want this
[00:45:33.900 --> 00:45:37.020]   And here's how I want it and I don't care who makes it for me
[00:45:37.020 --> 00:45:41.740]   But just let's get it going. We don't need to wait for stuff and here's the exact specification
[00:45:41.740 --> 00:45:45.900]   You don't think there's gonna I think there's gonna be kickstarter fatigue that people are going to start to realize for instance
[00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:51.500]   I've participated four or five kickstarter projects one was diaspora 100 bucks down the tube
[00:45:51.500 --> 00:45:56.140]   Uh one was some dice that I never got 150 bucks down the tube
[00:45:56.140 --> 00:46:03.420]   Don't you think that there's going to be kickstarter fatigue that has inevitably many of these projects are not going to produce a product that's worth anything
[00:46:03.580 --> 00:46:09.100]   Who knows if that pebble watch that I spent 125 bucks on is going to work is going to be any good
[00:46:09.100 --> 00:46:13.500]   I think we're in a bubble a kickstarter bubble. I cannot imagine this is going to continue
[00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:19.100]   I'm just waiting for the first really bad case. There's gonna be a horrible earned horrible example
[00:46:19.100 --> 00:46:24.700]   Somebody takes $10 million and goes to bermuda woven's on kickstarter. Right so they're trying to eat. Yeah
[00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:29.260]   Right. I mean it's a great model right now. These guys these pebble guys are very very happy
[00:46:29.340 --> 00:46:33.500]   They asked for $100,000. They got 10 million in a month. It just closed this week
[00:46:33.500 --> 00:46:36.140]   Um and I ordered a watch
[00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:37.660]   But you know that's a pretty spec
[00:46:37.660 --> 00:46:42.620]   I what I don't think people who use kickstarter realize how speculative what you're doing is there's no guarantee you're gonna get
[00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:45.740]   Diddly out of that. Yeah, I've been the whim
[00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:50.380]   Which also makes a watch and there was a y-com and air company that makes a watch and uh
[00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:55.100]   Nor is this a bubble. This is not gonna continue by buying a share of facebook
[00:46:55.100 --> 00:46:58.620]   I mean, there's no guarantees anywhere same same amount you probably
[00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:03.900]   Spent on the watch. You know out of my agree with you. I think yeah in in a few months
[00:47:03.900 --> 00:47:07.100]   We're gonna see facebook below $20. I absolutely believe that
[00:47:07.100 --> 00:47:13.260]   But I also believe that I if at that point it got down to say $17 and I actually had money to invest
[00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:15.260]   I would invest in facebook
[00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:17.660]   Not for facebook, but for zuck
[00:47:17.660 --> 00:47:21.580]   I've zuck has delivered. I mean you can you can spin it many different ways
[00:47:21.580 --> 00:47:26.780]   But he does have a vision and I see that going elsewhere and I think it actually goes beyond so
[00:47:26.780 --> 00:47:30.540]   Really doing a disservice then because you're not giving zuck anything
[00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:33.500]   You're buying something from somebody else
[00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:36.060]   No, and and suck already got it
[00:47:36.060 --> 00:47:39.660]   If every if 900 million people said hey, we really like this. Let's give zuck
[00:47:39.660 --> 00:47:46.220]   You know, uh, a $1 a month. What a great business. I would be jumping for joy, but why doesn't it work?
[00:47:46.220 --> 00:47:52.780]   Why doesn't anyone go that route? That's interesting. I mean, I I'm not recommending to do it. What if facebook did say let's
[00:47:52.780 --> 00:47:54.940]   Let's start charging on buck a month with
[00:47:55.340 --> 00:47:57.180]   Could they could they do that? Probably
[00:47:57.180 --> 00:48:01.980]   Yeah, some people would stay. I think they could actually yeah for a buck a month make it cheap
[00:48:01.980 --> 00:48:05.500]   Make it five bucks a year. You find out really quickly which accounts are actually
[00:48:05.500 --> 00:48:10.300]   You would we're talking about uh the uh week in tech and of course
[00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:13.660]   We've got a great panel to do at the podfather the godfather and the scobalizer
[00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:15.980]   We got more coming up in just a little bit
[00:48:15.980 --> 00:48:20.620]   Uh including a big eclipse that's coming. I don't know if you're gonna see it in Austin
[00:48:21.180 --> 00:48:24.700]   Uh-oh, that's too bad. I think we can I think we're to see a little bit of it here
[00:48:24.700 --> 00:48:27.420]   In fact, we've set up the flying saucers. We don't get
[00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:30.140]   Cool stuff like eclipses
[00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:37.100]   We've got the eclipse cam set up over on my shoulder. It's currently offline. Yeah as soon as the eclipse starts
[00:48:37.100 --> 00:48:40.060]   You will see it first over over the priest's shoulder
[00:48:40.060 --> 00:48:45.900]   Now this is a full lunar eclipse. So it goes completely. No, it's annular, which means it's a ring of fire
[00:48:45.900 --> 00:48:51.100]   Oh, right. All right. Right. So it has a little ring of the sun around. Yeah, the moon is slightly smaller than the sun
[00:48:51.260 --> 00:48:55.580]   Disc in this particular eclipse hasn't happened since 1994 in the us and will not happen
[00:48:55.580 --> 00:49:01.980]   We won't get a total eclipse at 2017. Although I'm going on a boat in november to see a total eclipse in uh, australia
[00:49:01.980 --> 00:49:07.420]   Excited about that. Oh leo. I can't believe you haven't played the theme song then. What's the theme song?
[00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:12.220]   Totally clips of the art the theme song. Oh, come on. Okay. You're disc you're disc jockey, aren't you?
[00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:14.380]   Well adam spin that disc is it?
[00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:20.940]   It's slow. You can't find bonnie tyler. He's searching are you using spotify? What are you got the search? All right is just uh
[00:49:21.100 --> 00:49:23.100]   here it comes
[00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:27.500]   Everybody sing one Johnny
[00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:31.260]   And a black love is a burning thing
[00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:38.140]   All right, great minds adam. I played this song at the end of my radio show this
[00:49:38.140 --> 00:49:44.060]   Well burn and ring if our breaking news robin give his past away by the way of the b g's
[00:49:44.060 --> 00:49:49.980]   Uh, he was sick. I knew that he was an ill health. So, uh, what what a what a tragedy
[00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:54.620]   And we've been losing a lot of mates. You gotta go full screen if you're gonna have him say that
[00:49:54.620 --> 00:50:01.340]   I work with those guys a lot. Did you really the bg's?
[00:50:01.340 --> 00:50:03.820]   Yeah, yeah
[00:50:03.820 --> 00:50:08.220]   And uh, anybody who was a dj in the in the late 70s early 80s
[00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:12.140]   Well, you know has mixed feelings about the bg's. Can I say it that way?
[00:50:12.140 --> 00:50:19.580]   But this but this is not fair because if you think about um, you know, spicks and specs and uh early bg's
[00:50:20.300 --> 00:50:25.260]   Sorry, yeah, early bg's. I mean really in all honesty before uh saturday night fever
[00:50:25.260 --> 00:50:29.420]   It was the stones. It was the bg's were part of that the kinks
[00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:35.420]   Of course the beetles, but if you if yeah, I think the bg's get uh, and I know they were frustrated about it
[00:50:35.420 --> 00:50:41.100]   They get a little ripped off because they're staying alive in 1977 and they became the disco group and uh,
[00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:45.660]   I think you're absolutely right, but the mining disaster was the name of that the uh, spring
[00:50:45.660 --> 00:50:48.220]   1957 47
[00:50:48.220 --> 00:50:50.220]   Uh, that was a great song
[00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:56.780]   a classic song by the way, um, you know, this is a good example out of album was it was a huge huge hit
[00:50:56.780 --> 00:51:03.500]   It was number one, uh, on a billboard chart for a couple months. I think and they were great great songwriters
[00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:08.940]   Um, it's just it really is just one tragedy after another for that family with andi gibb early on
[00:51:08.940 --> 00:51:13.500]   And uh, and marice and robin. I mean, um marice, of course still alive
[00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:15.980]   Uh, but it's just you know, it's sad
[00:51:17.340 --> 00:51:22.620]   Robert. This is a facebook moment, isn't it? Well, it's facebook twitter. I mean twitter. I'm sure is going nuts as well
[00:51:22.620 --> 00:51:27.900]   Let's go over to twitter, you know, I have I have lists of world news and stuff like that on twitter
[00:51:27.900 --> 00:51:29.580]   Whitney houston passed away
[00:51:29.580 --> 00:51:34.060]   I was at home. Well, my son had some kids over and one of them said I did Whitney houston died
[00:51:34.060 --> 00:51:38.940]   I said I don't think so, but let me check twitter. Yep, and of course I think she was killed
[00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:45.180]   All right, I don't want to be charged here. What the hell are you talking about?
[00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:49.260]   Well, let me tell you I was the first one to say I thought michael jaxon was murdered and
[00:51:49.260 --> 00:51:54.140]   You're right on that one and msmbc hung up on me when I said it the first time. Oh really
[00:51:54.140 --> 00:52:01.180]   Yeah, I have my secretly doubts about the Whitney houston death. You think she had a doctor feel good in the house
[00:52:01.180 --> 00:52:09.420]   Is a guy his name is ruffles van xl. Well, there's a problem right there. You got to watch out for that guy. I'd be angry him
[00:52:10.220 --> 00:52:18.220]   Right everybody on twitter is going nuts to ron washing post at usa today ruffles van xl
[00:52:18.220 --> 00:52:20.460]   But this is with anyone named fam
[00:52:20.460 --> 00:52:25.420]   But this is an example adam of where where these things are going these are media systems down
[00:52:25.420 --> 00:52:29.740]   They're not just bringing me photos of my family. They're bringing me the news
[00:52:29.740 --> 00:52:35.660]   Sure, but you know what? Robert i'm getting it on rss right now too. It's an open system and a format
[00:52:35.660 --> 00:52:39.900]   Nobody owns it. No one can shut it down. So i'm getting i'm getting the same information
[00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:44.220]   Well, I would agree with you from a political point of view adam it's far superior to have a free and open web
[00:52:44.220 --> 00:52:47.580]   I mean I have no i have no doubt about that, but that doesn't mean it's gonna win
[00:52:47.580 --> 00:52:54.620]   That's just the political talk that's just like what we want which is a free and open web and what we're doing here with facebook
[00:52:54.620 --> 00:53:00.300]   And in some cases twitter is going to this model with its new discovery tab is a personalized
[00:53:00.300 --> 00:53:06.860]   View of the world based on who you are social graph. So it's studying your so it's studying everything about you
[00:53:06.860 --> 00:53:09.980]   This is why you bought instagram each photo you take is six to five
[00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:15.260]   Six to fifteen likes right you're telling it a lot about who you are by taking a photo
[00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:19.340]   And we and the point is that we've yet to see anybody figure out how to monetize that
[00:53:19.340 --> 00:53:23.020]   I believe that's coming and i'll i'll bet i'll bet you adam
[00:53:23.020 --> 00:53:27.740]   A hundred bucks that we're gonna see some major monetization happen on mobile in the next year
[00:53:27.740 --> 00:53:31.580]   Well, there's a lot of people baiting $38 and 32 cents a share right now
[00:53:31.580 --> 00:53:36.140]   Hey, let's take a break come back with more with buzzkill. I mean adam curry

[00:57:28.780 --> 00:57:30.860]   Yahoo is best at good. So
[00:57:30.860 --> 00:57:33.100]   yahoo

[00:57:41.580 --> 00:57:46.460]   Took me a while to figure that out. I don't think yahoo has seven billion. No, it couldn't go the other way

[00:58:01.660 --> 00:58:05.980]   So uh, are you gonna are you gonna you can't see the eclipse or you?
[00:58:05.980 --> 00:58:09.340]   We're gonna all run out after the show and look at the eclipse. We've got the eclipse cam going
[00:58:09.340 --> 00:58:13.180]   This is an annular eclipse that is a ring of fire as adam pointed out
[00:58:13.180 --> 00:58:18.780]   Uh, and it's offline right now. I'm actually gonna go out there and look straight at it. Just good idea
[00:58:18.780 --> 00:58:21.900]   I don't believe that hurts in any way. I think in fact uh
[00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:27.420]   Blindness is you know, it's an eclipse right? So there's no sun. I mean, yeah, actually that's the problem is it looks dark
[00:58:27.420 --> 00:58:29.420]   But it don't hurt less than buying
[00:58:29.420 --> 00:58:35.260]   We much longer term effect. I believe yes, don't look at the sun
[00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:39.340]   We uh, I think we found number 14 ark welder glass
[00:58:39.340 --> 00:58:41.580]   did we
[00:58:41.580 --> 00:58:44.940]   Bert birk thinks he found it birk bork bought number 10
[00:58:44.940 --> 00:58:47.660]   I'm not gonna blind you
[00:58:47.660 --> 00:58:51.260]   And uh, and you can't yeah, you can't stack it. He was just like, I will stack it up
[00:58:51.820 --> 00:58:53.980]   Not possible by the way, chris mark was
[00:58:53.980 --> 00:58:58.460]   Looking at the sun just put poke a little hole in a piece of
[00:58:58.460 --> 00:59:02.220]   The pinhole camera and you you know, just hold it up
[00:59:02.220 --> 00:59:05.260]   Okay, I'm just gonna tell you white paper as a kid who did that
[00:59:05.260 --> 00:59:10.700]   It it sucks because you're not looking at the sun. You're looking at what looks like a shadow
[00:59:10.700 --> 00:59:15.580]   Yeah, you want to look and say oh look the moon's blocking the sun
[00:59:18.380 --> 00:59:21.740]   By the way, I still can't see out of the left side of my eye. So just don't do that kids
[00:59:21.740 --> 00:59:24.940]   Unless you have number 14 not number 10
[00:59:24.940 --> 00:59:28.700]   I can't believe birk went out and bought number 10. Well, there's glass for me
[00:59:28.700 --> 00:59:33.100]   Let me see. I once welded like 30 minutes without without glasses when I was
[00:59:33.100 --> 00:59:34.540]   Did you look at it?
[00:59:34.540 --> 00:59:39.180]   If for like half an hour just like oh, you know as the old electrode and like I can just do this just a quick little point thing
[00:59:39.180 --> 00:59:45.740]   And I woke up in the middle of the night and was the worst feeling ever just my eyes were on fire and screaming tears
[00:59:45.900 --> 00:59:48.860]   You should got to be careful. Yeah, you can actually can really burn your
[00:59:48.860 --> 00:59:52.620]   Burn your retinas. Yeah, so you know somebody
[00:59:52.620 --> 00:59:58.060]   Likened it to using a magnifying glass with the sun to burn a hole in the leaf
[00:59:58.060 --> 01:00:02.140]   You don't because your little ends of your eye actually focuses it on the back of your retina
[01:00:02.140 --> 01:00:02.700]   It's not good
[01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:06.620]   You actually get that with enterprise work if you're doing any splicing of fiber
[01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:09.180]   You always have to make sure everyone knows not to light it up
[01:00:09.180 --> 01:00:15.020]   Because it's it you can't see it and as you're examining it examining the end you actually look through a magnifying glass
[01:00:15.180 --> 01:00:20.060]   No fiber. No, and you don't know it until the next day is a fiber. Is it very bright?
[01:00:20.060 --> 01:00:25.580]   You know you can't see it. It's visible light. So that the saying is don't look at the side with the remaining good eye
[01:00:25.580 --> 01:00:32.540]   That's the sun. There's the eclipse. Oh, you got some that's the sun. Oh, there are you gonna return it? Oh, let's keep it
[01:00:32.540 --> 01:00:35.100]   It's cheap
[01:00:35.100 --> 01:00:41.820]   That's a great shot. There it is. There it is. Yeah, nice. The eclipse has is that real? That's pedobare
[01:00:45.020 --> 01:00:49.020]   Are you calling Robert pedobare or the sun? The eclipse? Oh, no, I'd never do that
[01:00:49.020 --> 01:00:54.540]   I can't see it it works. You can't see anything through this
[01:00:54.540 --> 01:01:01.100]   Well, how could you this is number 10 and you can't look ahead, Robert. Can you see anything? No, I can't even see the lights here
[01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:08.460]   No, I got one of those and that's not enough. Look look Adam. Where'd you get yours? I'm sorry. That's my galaxy note
[01:01:10.220 --> 01:01:14.860]   By the way, this just in it is safe to look at the eclipse through a galaxy note. That's very safe
[01:01:14.860 --> 01:01:17.180]   Do you use a note?
[01:01:17.180 --> 01:01:21.260]   Yeah, I just got one and actually you influenced me on that. It's awesome. Isn't it? Do you like it?
[01:01:21.260 --> 01:01:25.500]   Well, I have big hands. So yes, uh, it works. You know what that is
[01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:31.180]   Hard to find shoes. I saw an S3 this week. No, the batteries are and you could buy three of them
[01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:36.860]   You have an S3. No, I saw one. I that's nine million. They've sold to those. That's iPhone numbers
[01:01:37.660 --> 01:01:40.940]   This might be get be the death of my apple fanboys
[01:01:40.940 --> 01:01:47.580]   This might be the one that gets me this thing is just so fast and so the screen is so stunning
[01:01:47.580 --> 01:01:52.860]   You know what's wrong with it? You're running android. Oh, yeah, leo have you have you are you running android on your nose?
[01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:58.940]   What did you say? Adam? Have you tried a different ROM on it yet? No, because I just got ics they pushed a ice cream sandwich
[01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:01.340]   The no really? Yeah. Yeah
[01:02:01.340 --> 01:02:03.500]   Oh, I didn't get that yet. You'll get it any day now
[01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:09.340]   Sea antigen mod seven guy me too. I like cm seven and cm nine of course is ics and yes you can put cm nine
[01:02:09.340 --> 01:02:15.260]   The reason I don't use those ROMs often end up not using them is because always something doesn't work
[01:02:15.260 --> 01:02:21.020]   Like the the gps doesn't work or the camera doesn't work and it's like oh no. I had the the original google phone
[01:02:21.020 --> 01:02:23.740]   You know the the next is the next is worked fine
[01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:28.540]   Yeah, and yeah, and I would see him on that and it was it was fantastic and I loved it
[01:02:28.620 --> 01:02:33.580]   That phone is basically unlocked, but I don't either note the note ROMs were not perfect yet
[01:02:33.580 --> 01:02:37.980]   However, I do have ice cream sandwich now on the galaxy. No, it's very nice
[01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:43.100]   And doesn't have the issue in your screenshot and then drawing mustache as on people. Yeah, is that fun? Yeah
[01:02:43.100 --> 01:02:49.420]   That's the extent of it. So I can't I can't believe that this would be unsafe to use
[01:02:49.420 --> 01:02:54.620]   Because I can't I mean I really I can I guess I could see the lights. I can barely see the lights
[01:02:55.500 --> 01:03:00.060]   I think I'm gonna use this every step up is a double doubling of the obscurity
[01:03:00.060 --> 01:03:03.660]   So two by number ten and is equal to one by number 11
[01:03:03.660 --> 01:03:06.220]   It's like 11 is equal to one by 12
[01:03:06.220 --> 01:03:09.260]   So two 14's a lot. How could you even see anything?
[01:03:09.260 --> 01:03:13.660]   I'm gonna use this. Well, it's gonna be fine. We've got two interns, right? They could test it
[01:03:13.660 --> 01:03:17.260]   You know what I'm gonna do anyway. I'm gonna go. I'm gonna go son. No, I won't look
[01:03:17.260 --> 01:03:19.260]   I'll see choir boys pudray
[01:03:19.260 --> 01:03:21.420]   Exactly. Well, I if you just
[01:03:22.300 --> 01:03:28.780]   Blink back and forth really quickly. I think you'll be okay. That's I'm gonna try it with this and I'm and I'll let you know
[01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:30.460]   tomorrow
[01:03:30.460 --> 01:03:32.460]   Hey, if he comes in with
[01:03:32.460 --> 01:03:37.420]   If he comes in with a guard guide dog, well, no
[01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:42.860]   Yeah, don't mess with it. That's for sure. Yeah, Microsoft. Hey interesting. Just launch their social network
[01:03:42.860 --> 01:03:46.700]   Let's say I'm gonna start the show by talking about this
[01:03:46.700 --> 01:03:51.100]   This is what this is no we weren't on there. This is why we need crickets a cricket sound effect
[01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:53.260]   Do you have one Adam? Uh
[01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:56.460]   Microsoft just launched its social network
[01:03:56.460 --> 01:03:59.340]   Cricket
[01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:07.900]   If you see something say something, I think we should report them for terrorism
[01:04:07.900 --> 01:04:16.540]   Microsoft Microsoft left the package at the airport called s o dot cl unattended
[01:04:16.540 --> 01:04:20.300]   The uh, the police came blew it up and there was nothing inside
[01:04:21.180 --> 01:04:25.420]   s o dot cl even the name sucks
[01:04:25.420 --> 01:04:29.980]   What the hell Microsoft you couldn't do better
[01:04:29.980 --> 01:04:38.060]   S o how do you pronounce that so cool social social so so something so silly is so silly so
[01:04:38.060 --> 01:04:40.620]   perfect. Yes
[01:04:40.620 --> 01:04:44.860]   What what is Microsoft thing? So if you there's the other fun thing here, I'll sign in
[01:04:44.860 --> 01:04:47.500]   It says you want to sign in with Facebook
[01:04:49.660 --> 01:04:55.420]   Yeah, except it doesn't use Facebook very smartly. It should bring my social graph over here and sign everybody up
[01:04:55.420 --> 01:05:00.620]   Oh, you see this is the problem. Yeah, if only you could get your stuff out of Facebook and put it on
[01:05:00.620 --> 01:05:06.620]   That's true. Whatever. I'm in a wild garden. I and I like it. Look here's an ad for google plus on so cool
[01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:08.460]   Go to my pick my screen
[01:05:08.460 --> 01:05:14.780]   This is great. They're right at the top of the page. There's an ad for google plus adam kerry is doing his best to channel dave liner
[01:05:14.780 --> 01:05:19.500]   What does winer think of so cool? Oh, he hates this stuff. He's like adam
[01:05:19.580 --> 01:05:24.220]   He wants to have actually been working with dave for the past two years on some stuff and uh,
[01:05:24.220 --> 01:05:29.660]   I'm I'm pretty influenced. Um, I can tell that's why I brought it up
[01:05:29.660 --> 01:05:34.940]   Hey, look, you know, I am exactly in your camp free and open web. Absolutely
[01:05:34.940 --> 01:05:38.460]   I just sometimes despair of the of the chances that will succeed
[01:05:38.460 --> 01:05:41.260]   But if you say that always going to succeed
[01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:46.780]   And the open web is different from the network then if if the network we're controllable
[01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:49.580]   We'd be paying tax already. Trust me, right?
[01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:54.700]   The government could could do it. They would but you can't wait ethernet and I at TCP IP
[01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:59.660]   It's magical stuff that you can route around it in so many ways. Can they shut down portions of the web?
[01:05:59.660 --> 01:06:00.620]   Yeah, of course
[01:06:00.620 --> 01:06:03.180]   There's all kinds of things that can be done, but can you really really?
[01:06:03.180 --> 01:06:07.900]   Turn the network off and really remove it. No, I don't think so god. I hope you're right
[01:06:07.900 --> 01:06:10.700]   Me too
[01:06:10.700 --> 01:06:12.700]   Seriously for all of our sakes
[01:06:12.700 --> 01:06:18.300]   This this twit wouldn't exist without the free and open web we ride right on top of it on rss
[01:06:18.300 --> 01:06:20.940]   Uh on the fact that we can use
[01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:24.460]   Uh a variety of channels to stream to get to you
[01:06:24.460 --> 01:06:29.020]   Uh, we we need that the free and open web's not going to be killed by something like facebook
[01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:33.900]   It's gonna. It's gonna be killed by Comcast. Well, that may be there's a there's an excellent point right there
[01:06:33.900 --> 01:06:39.260]   You know leo people don't need facebook to enjoy your show. No, you're working around facebook
[01:06:39.660 --> 01:06:44.060]   I'm working around facebook. It's not the be all and end all of it's not necessary
[01:06:44.060 --> 01:06:49.340]   I never said it was necessary. I just said it was people love it
[01:06:49.340 --> 01:06:55.740]   People love it. Yeah, people love porn too. You people love porn. Hey, nobody lost money investing in porn
[01:06:55.740 --> 01:07:02.220]   No, right. I mean, I'm not well actually yes, but now they have the last couple of years
[01:07:02.220 --> 01:07:06.140]   Um, how do you know this Robert? I I pay attention to trends
[01:07:06.140 --> 01:07:12.860]   I'm so sorry. You're never gonna be treated in the whole person you're probably
[01:07:12.860 --> 01:07:16.140]   You're sorry. No, but this is seriously my first company
[01:07:16.140 --> 01:07:21.180]   There was a huge porn industry enclave in Henderson, Nevada right outside of Las Vegas
[01:07:21.180 --> 01:07:26.620]   And it has it has dried up. Sorry, um, completely completely dried up
[01:07:26.620 --> 01:07:33.580]   And there's there's no one working there anymore. They're they're not frequenting the restaurants anymore and and they they say
[01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:38.380]   You know why the internet because you because of piracy piracy is killed porn
[01:07:38.380 --> 01:07:42.780]   Right. Oh amateurs have you were saying Adam you have an employee
[01:07:42.780 --> 01:07:47.580]   Former employee a guy who worked for me at my first company in New York. He was an art director
[01:07:47.580 --> 01:07:52.380]   Amateurs porn touch. Sorry. I've just heard what Robert said that
[01:07:52.380 --> 01:07:59.340]   I've read this amateur porn has killed the professionals he um, so he contacted me
[01:07:59.340 --> 01:08:02.860]   I was going out to LA to visit my daughter. He said, oh come stay at my place in Malibu
[01:08:03.500 --> 01:08:07.820]   And it went there and I'm like, oh my god. There's like a 20 million dollar house, you know,
[01:08:07.820 --> 01:08:11.500]   Ferraris, I'm like dude. What are you doing? And um
[01:08:11.500 --> 01:08:17.580]   He started a uh, a porn company, but a really high end, you know, he shoots with a red camera
[01:08:17.580 --> 01:08:19.500]   He says, you know, really
[01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:21.020]   4k porn
[01:08:21.020 --> 01:08:24.860]   I don't know if I can take but but you know what it is. It's in and Robert will like this
[01:08:24.860 --> 01:08:30.380]   It's not so much about the porn itself. There's a community the people who pay
[01:08:30.860 --> 01:08:36.940]   95 a month they're extremely involved in the actors and what the girls are doing and then you know
[01:08:36.940 --> 01:08:41.500]   They'll do chat sessions and they've really built this this huge community of porn
[01:08:41.500 --> 01:08:45.580]   And people are paying for that gladly, but it's not just about the you know
[01:08:45.580 --> 01:08:51.500]   The movies because of course the stuff gets bit tormented like crazy, right people keep paying for what that real
[01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:53.820]   um
[01:08:53.820 --> 01:08:58.060]   Community is social porn. Well now I know that 4k has a future
[01:08:58.060 --> 01:09:00.060]   I
[01:09:00.060 --> 01:09:06.300]   Remember when that was the bell weather? Yeah, it's still like HD DVD was gonna win because the porn industry had a
[01:09:06.300 --> 01:09:10.460]   Back for k-porn if Facebook see this is the conundrum with facebook
[01:09:10.460 --> 01:09:16.300]   I know lots of webcam girls who get kicked off of facebook because you know they show some side boob or something that's going on
[01:09:16.300 --> 01:09:22.540]   And then their accounts are closed. They can't utilize facebook and if they could there would be a lot of
[01:09:22.540 --> 01:09:27.580]   Money flowing through facebook, but of course because of what they are and what they become they can't do that
[01:09:27.660 --> 01:09:33.740]   So it's a real conundrum, but that would that would be something I would believe in so we've actually now figured out what mark Zuckerberg secret
[01:09:33.740 --> 01:09:36.300]   uh plan for monetization is side boob
[01:09:36.300 --> 01:09:40.700]   Is that right?
[01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:45.900]   That's a different kind of open graph that I think he's talking about
[01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:49.980]   I'm so sorry folks. I didn't want to go there
[01:09:49.980 --> 01:09:55.820]   Here's a so cool when you invite me leo. No, it's me. It's not you. It's because i'm sitting next to a priest
[01:09:56.220 --> 01:10:00.780]   So there's something about me. I'm a rebel and as soon as that happens I go I go I go south
[01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:04.940]   So s o dot c l microsoft social network. Here's the test. I'm on it right now
[01:10:04.940 --> 01:10:10.060]   This is the everyone feed how long how far down do I have to scroll before I see that robin gibb passed
[01:10:10.060 --> 01:10:13.900]   That would be a good test wouldn't it? I don't know. Let's first off refresh it
[01:10:13.900 --> 01:10:17.420]   So we make sure we have the latest this is the latest everyone feed
[01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:21.660]   I I looked at it this morning and it only micsoft in place. I'm scrolling down
[01:10:21.660 --> 01:10:24.140]   Hello world
[01:10:25.660 --> 01:10:27.660]   There's a picture of the clips
[01:10:27.660 --> 01:10:29.020]   Uh
[01:10:29.020 --> 01:10:32.780]   Oh, yeah, there's finally there we go. There we go. The world of music mourns the death of gibb
[01:10:32.780 --> 01:10:36.300]   It's it's pretty far down. That's I'm almost to the bottom of the page
[01:10:36.300 --> 01:10:41.900]   Cory said he just started breaking news up here on so-called a guy who started breaking news on facebook
[01:10:41.900 --> 01:10:46.460]   Well, that's telling. Yeah, he's the guy sold it to cnn for some unknown amount
[01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:51.820]   Boy, I had to scroll pretty far down. This is not yet a lively network
[01:10:52.300 --> 01:10:57.740]   I'm three quarters of the way down large press here. It is large press free porn videos. If you followed
[01:10:57.740 --> 01:11:02.700]   If you followed breaking news on so-called you can so I need to follow them
[01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:05.980]   He has the bg of use, but that just I mean to me that shows you
[01:11:05.980 --> 01:11:12.940]   Uh that this has a ways to go. It's not a bad interface. It's just why it looks like google plus today
[01:11:12.940 --> 01:11:17.660]   That's what I said today today. Yeah, exactly and is google plus getting us all hot and bother
[01:11:17.660 --> 01:11:20.140]   How many people are hot bothered by google plus an audience?
[01:11:20.860 --> 01:11:24.780]   Nobody no and that's one funny thing. I mean people are using google plus there's no doubt about it
[01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:31.260]   They're very devoted and they will make a lot of noise about how no, it's a great. It's vital. It's exciting
[01:11:31.260 --> 01:11:36.300]   But it's a I think it's a it's a relatively small group and it's not anybody I know and that's really what it comes down to
[01:11:36.300 --> 01:11:39.980]   Is anybody you know using it? Is anybody you know using facebook everybody?
[01:11:39.980 --> 01:11:43.500]   And that's where most people that's the network effect
[01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:47.980]   I spoke to two audiences about 600 people this last week and I asked that question and
[01:11:48.540 --> 01:11:51.820]   5% of the hands went up that they didn't use facebook, but
[01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:55.100]   90 that means 95 are you know who's so close for
[01:11:55.100 --> 01:11:59.900]   Students millions of people in Asia buying windows phones. Oh that could be
[01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:07.660]   Here's the story from cnet microsoft quietly launches so called social network software giants experiment in open search
[01:12:07.660 --> 01:12:13.740]   Is designed to be a research tool in which students share information? So maybe we're maybe we're misunderstanding it
[01:12:13.740 --> 01:12:17.740]   Maybe it's not a social network. Now that should take us right into the knowledge graph
[01:12:17.980 --> 01:12:20.860]   And that's what google launched
[01:12:20.860 --> 01:12:25.260]   And that's what google launched. So if you can't beat him create a new buzzword
[01:12:25.260 --> 01:12:28.300]   To this week google launched the knowledge graph
[01:12:28.300 --> 01:12:34.620]   Full craft idea. What is it? I don't even know what it is and I interviewed matt cuts this week the way I see it
[01:12:34.620 --> 01:12:36.860]   they're now going to
[01:12:36.860 --> 01:12:42.300]   Use their crazy algorithms to figure out what you're asking for and then they're going to get the facts
[01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:44.780]   from wikipedia and the cia
[01:12:47.340 --> 01:12:50.060]   The whole reason the internet is cool. My search was so cool
[01:12:50.060 --> 01:12:55.980]   Because you can get these crazy websites you can jump from one to the other and really learn something now
[01:12:55.980 --> 01:13:01.100]   You don't have to and cia fact book give me a break. So here. I am. I've searched
[01:13:01.100 --> 01:13:06.620]   Robert scoble now. I don't know if i'm getting it. Is this it? Yeah, that's the the thing on the right is the knowledge graph
[01:13:06.620 --> 01:13:08.940]   So um there it is knowledge
[01:13:08.940 --> 01:13:12.940]   Robert scoble is where does this text come from robert is an american wikipedia
[01:13:13.180 --> 01:13:19.420]   So here's the wikipedia entry here's the google plus information by the way. I didn't have anything to do with my wikipedia
[01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:22.220]   Right, it's the truth. It's the knowledge graph. It's totally the truth
[01:13:22.220 --> 01:13:25.340]   And you didn't write it. Here's your latest post on google plus
[01:13:25.340 --> 01:13:33.660]   Wait a minute. I want that you have an echo chamber. No, I just have the uh, it's a button
[01:13:33.660 --> 01:13:37.740]   The knowledge graph rocks
[01:13:41.420 --> 01:13:44.700]   Chad you don't have that do you when it is turned into the no agenda show
[01:13:44.700 --> 01:13:49.580]   Um people came on now look who they say I should search for since i'm searching for you
[01:13:49.580 --> 01:13:53.980]   And I wonder if you agree with this dave whiner michael errington vik undotra
[01:13:53.980 --> 01:14:00.300]   They're our own google person thikah wasaki and pebyn rose you think he had a little finger on the scale to get his icon
[01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:07.100]   And a lot of searches search for adam curry i'm very curious because they're comparing your contact details which they've taken away
[01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:12.940]   That novel so adam curry leo you thought your picture was bad. What the heck is that?
[01:14:12.940 --> 01:14:19.500]   How old is that adam and i wasn't born in washington dc. That's for my wife. That's my ex-wife, right?
[01:14:19.500 --> 01:14:23.260]   It's all fact science is in it's great. Thanks google

[01:14:30.940 --> 01:14:32.780]   Um
[01:14:32.780 --> 01:14:36.620]   Thank you google. That's that's your knowledge graph right there mine isn't wrong
[01:14:37.580 --> 01:14:39.580]   at any point
[01:14:39.580 --> 01:14:42.060]   Um
[01:14:42.060 --> 01:14:47.420]   Hmm now the picture is very wrong. It does list my home address, which is not really cool
[01:14:47.420 --> 01:14:52.620]   I just noticed that
[01:14:52.620 --> 01:14:54.620]   What the hell google
[01:14:54.620 --> 01:14:58.540]   Would you search for my name just to see if you see my home address i do not
[01:14:58.540 --> 01:15:04.220]   Scroll down. Oh, thank god was just me
[01:15:05.660 --> 01:15:11.420]   No, that's my home address. Oh my gosh leo. This is I think this is really a okay. I know hate the knowledge graph
[01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:18.060]   Wait, it's a limited thing though. So it's covered my own circle. Yeah. Yeah, you're my buddy. Yeah. Yeah, okay
[01:15:18.060 --> 01:15:23.980]   You gave your friends access to your house a really big mistake the google is make i'm crashing that party tonight by the way
[01:15:23.980 --> 01:15:26.460]   Come on over
[01:15:26.460 --> 01:15:28.460]   Um really open for
[01:15:28.460 --> 01:15:30.060]   Um
[01:15:30.060 --> 01:15:34.700]   Well anybody to just just to search the way we like it that what we really want
[01:15:35.260 --> 01:15:37.260]   Well, that's the isn't that the challenge?
[01:15:37.260 --> 01:15:40.220]   Sorry, isn't that their challenge though?
[01:15:40.220 --> 01:15:42.140]   How do you give how do you improve search?
[01:15:42.140 --> 01:15:44.940]   How do you know what adam kree was looking for?
[01:15:44.940 --> 01:15:47.660]   Well, you I like the original google idea
[01:15:47.660 --> 01:15:52.860]   Where they had the page rank then that that worked pretty well and you know, and you had uh
[01:15:52.860 --> 01:15:59.580]   Yeah, you had to learn a little bit of boolean language, you know plus or minus something or use and I mean how hard is that?
[01:15:59.580 --> 01:16:04.540]   Are we total idiots? But now it's pulling from wikipedia. That's that's not so good
[01:16:05.020 --> 01:16:07.020]   Here's what's going on though
[01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:13.180]   It's the book of knowledge. Come on. This is not the book of knowledge. This is not fact
[01:16:13.180 --> 01:16:16.460]   It's not true. We just want searchers on the source and it's gained
[01:16:16.460 --> 01:16:18.300]   Yeah, the problem is
[01:16:18.300 --> 01:16:21.260]   Adam and and google has the same problem that facebook has the
[01:16:21.260 --> 01:16:23.500]   Monetization of this stuff is going down
[01:16:23.500 --> 01:16:25.900]   Their last quarter wasn't all that great
[01:16:25.900 --> 01:16:30.700]   Because the results that they're showing us on google are so good that we don't stick on these pages
[01:16:30.700 --> 01:16:34.380]   We don't search them, you know when google first started and I don't know
[01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:39.980]   I got into it on in 98. I think I went through I would have to do two or three pages worth of
[01:16:39.980 --> 01:16:44.860]   Search is just I agree. I wanted but you know what i've been running i've been running yac for
[01:16:44.860 --> 01:16:53.100]   For like spell that y a c y it's uh, it's it's acronym for yet another search and search engine
[01:16:53.100 --> 01:16:56.220]   I think and not my book. It's open source
[01:16:56.220 --> 01:17:03.020]   You can run it on your laptop. You can run it anywhere you want you can tell it what sites to spider what you're looking for
[01:17:03.580 --> 01:17:05.740]   Spider rss feeds even which is kind of cool
[01:17:05.740 --> 01:17:10.940]   And you can create your own search world that connects through a like a bit torrent like
[01:17:10.940 --> 01:17:14.380]   Swarm and you know it's it's not
[01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:19.500]   Really user-friendly yet. It's not something that everyone can install and make work right off the bat. I got it done
[01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:24.540]   Oh, it's software. Oh, it's software. It's software. Yeah, and it's open source and and you know
[01:17:24.540 --> 01:17:29.340]   I think that we need to move back towards stuff like that. We're gonna have to you're absolutely right, Robert
[01:17:29.340 --> 01:17:31.340]   The search model is kind of ending
[01:17:31.900 --> 01:17:35.740]   Um the seo guys know how to gain if you type in why I don't want to plug it
[01:17:35.740 --> 01:17:41.020]   But if you were to type in the name of our show, you'll see that we have the first nine pages belong to us
[01:17:41.020 --> 01:17:46.220]   That's completely gained in seo'd while those words aren't necessarily owned by us
[01:17:46.220 --> 01:17:52.140]   This is what google is up against so wait a minute. You're no you use your users. You're listeners to game it
[01:17:52.140 --> 01:17:59.100]   That's actually quite clever actually the the the the guy who does seo for the ron paul campaign did our seo cheese
[01:18:00.140 --> 01:18:02.940]   And now he's got a lot of free time now. So you're gonna get even better
[01:18:02.940 --> 01:18:08.700]   You watch out for that convention leo look I thought ron paul was true. I thought he withdrew
[01:18:08.700 --> 01:18:15.740]   No, no, no, no, you just not campaigning any new marker, but he's gathering he just got 38 of the 40 delegates in minnesota
[01:18:15.740 --> 01:18:18.700]   You think ron paul will be the republican nominee
[01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:23.740]   I would love it to be it's not impossible. Yeah. Yeah that and the free and open web
[01:18:25.020 --> 01:18:31.260]   Rompaul's like the crazy uncle that everybody likes but see now that's that's just being completely agist and
[01:18:31.260 --> 01:18:36.460]   You know, I don't say anything about your collar
[01:18:36.460 --> 01:18:41.980]   So if I search for now you should have stuck with facebook predictions
[01:18:41.980 --> 01:18:48.460]   If I search for no agenda the you're saying that all of these results have been seo'd yeah
[01:18:48.460 --> 01:18:52.220]   Nice job page after page after page
[01:18:52.700 --> 01:18:59.580]   But I think that's at a more reflection the fact that the term no agenda show is unique really
[01:18:59.580 --> 01:19:03.900]   But the but the well the we don't even own no agenda calm
[01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:07.900]   Yeah, we have no agenda show calm, but this is just
[01:19:07.900 --> 01:19:14.780]   You have it's our audience, but a lot of it is it's around by seo and that's that's outrageous way to think about it
[01:19:14.780 --> 01:19:16.860]   So you're not doing this, but you have a guy who does
[01:19:16.860 --> 01:19:19.820]   He did one they did it for us once and it's stuck
[01:19:20.380 --> 01:19:25.820]   Like no agenda novels calm. Oh, yeah, we got tons of crazy things that people set up for it
[01:19:25.820 --> 01:19:31.260]   Yeah, they wrote a whole book about us and what was it de Vorac was saying a couple of weeks ago that if you search for
[01:19:31.260 --> 01:19:37.660]   I don't rick stan torum.com or something it would go to no. Um, uh, what's the guy on fox?
[01:19:37.660 --> 01:19:44.620]   Sean Hannity oh Sean Hannity that we own Sean Hannity. Well, we don't someone owns it and is forwarding it to our website
[01:19:44.620 --> 01:19:47.100]   Yeah, no san torm goes in place else
[01:19:47.660 --> 01:19:50.300]   Yes, I know rick perry is an idiot.com
[01:19:50.300 --> 01:19:54.300]   You know, this is it this is what this is the power of community at him
[01:19:54.300 --> 01:19:56.140]   This is where you've succeeded so well
[01:19:56.140 --> 01:20:03.660]   It's the power of a devoted it may be not even huge but a devoted community that is engaged activist on your behalf
[01:20:03.660 --> 01:20:07.180]   It's huge. Well, it's uh, yes, but it's also the result of a
[01:20:07.180 --> 01:20:10.140]   quality product
[01:20:10.140 --> 01:20:15.580]   Of course you don't get it without having something that people love. Yeah. Yeah, that that's what it take now
[01:20:15.580 --> 01:20:19.820]   You have a quality product. I our fans aren't this crazy. I don't know if you search for twit
[01:20:19.820 --> 01:20:25.820]   We know the twit army is out of control. Are you kidding? Yeah, that's not this is just my carrington
[01:20:25.820 --> 01:20:31.500]   Chat room. No, no, no, no, this is the nothing wrong with your community Leo. No, I'm not
[01:20:31.500 --> 01:20:35.420]   I love very at time me right now. By the way. Oh, that's normal
[01:20:35.420 --> 01:20:43.340]   You know, we we do own the first few pages of the results for twit and that's pretty good considering that twit in fact is a pregnant goldfish
[01:20:44.140 --> 01:20:46.460]   Ah, see then the money python starts to sneak in
[01:20:46.460 --> 01:20:52.940]   That's pretty good and that so that's good. The twitter did twitter hasn't ruined twit for me
[01:20:52.940 --> 01:20:56.860]   Yet there's a few a few twitters in there
[01:20:56.860 --> 01:21:02.700]   Uh, let's uh take a break and move on. I want to talk about uh, the mac books lots of rumors about a
[01:21:02.700 --> 01:21:05.100]   Ivy bridge new ivy bridge macbook
[01:21:05.100 --> 01:21:08.140]   And maybe the last mac books
[01:21:08.140 --> 01:21:13.260]   I wouldn't be surprised if apple gets out of the p the desktop laptop business entirely
[01:21:13.580 --> 01:21:16.460]   Goes all mobile. What do you think we'll talk about when we come back?
[01:21:16.460 --> 01:21:23.420]   But first avoid from audible.com. I love audible and you I know love audible because I hear from you all the time
[01:21:23.420 --> 01:21:29.260]   One of the things that happens with people who become audible subscribers is the all they can't help but just kind of oh if you listen to
[01:21:29.260 --> 01:21:31.420]   No, you know, it just came out. Oh, this is exciting

[01:25:47.020 --> 01:25:55.500]   We'll get we'll get uh as I love me the predator. Oh, yeah as morris says in the chat room audible is such a no-brainer
[01:25:55.580 --> 01:26:00.780]   Do it now that's an endorsement from our audience audible.com/twit2 to two books for you
[01:26:00.780 --> 01:26:03.020]   You know what now let me ask you crackpot
[01:26:03.020 --> 01:26:06.780]   You're a baby. I don't didn't they legalize
[01:26:06.780 --> 01:26:09.980]   Predator drones if for use in the us
[01:26:09.980 --> 01:26:15.740]   No, um and i'm a pilot. So I actually follow this stuff. I fly helicopters and airplanes
[01:26:15.740 --> 01:26:18.460]   Um, what did they legalize?
[01:26:18.460 --> 01:26:20.700]   Well, they haven't legalized anything yet the FAA
[01:26:21.420 --> 01:26:25.500]   has to have implementation of regulations by 2015
[01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:28.220]   and the
[01:26:28.220 --> 01:26:34.220]   Rules the way they are now is that the drones will not be allowed because you know the the space above your head
[01:26:34.220 --> 01:26:38.140]   Of your house is yours the airspace. There's some overfly rules
[01:26:38.140 --> 01:26:41.420]   But they will not be allowed to fly under 500 feet
[01:26:41.420 --> 01:26:46.060]   So here in texas the way I see it if I can actually see that thing
[01:26:46.060 --> 01:26:49.020]   And I can hit it with this
[01:26:50.780 --> 01:26:55.340]   It's the first time anybody's pulled a gun on twit. That's good. I like it. You are in texas my friend
[01:26:55.340 --> 01:26:59.660]   By the look of this thing man. This is great. This has shotgun shells in it. Look at that
[01:26:59.660 --> 01:27:07.580]   Does texas does texas have one of those stand and what do they call them standing the liver laws?
[01:27:07.580 --> 01:27:10.380]   Stand your ground. Stand your ground law. Yes, of course
[01:27:10.380 --> 01:27:13.500]   So please don't approach at him because he's not turning a tail
[01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:15.500]   I tell you something if you look at the statistics
[01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:18.540]   You know violent crime is much lower in texas
[01:27:18.940 --> 01:27:21.580]   People are very nice to each other because they're all armed
[01:27:21.580 --> 01:27:25.980]   He's after you sir. There's no home burglary
[01:27:25.980 --> 01:27:31.340]   It's sad that that's what it is that that's how it works, but it the system does work
[01:27:31.340 --> 01:27:33.660]   It's the again people are very polite
[01:27:33.660 --> 01:27:37.180]   Traffic is no road rage. It just doesn't happen. That's true
[01:27:37.180 --> 01:27:41.660]   People want to get their head blown you ain't gonna flip somebody off in the car next to you because you never know
[01:27:41.660 --> 01:27:44.940]   I tell my son that all the time. He doesn't believe me. I said don't flip that guy off
[01:27:44.940 --> 01:27:47.340]   He could have a gun if he were in texas he don't
[01:27:48.300 --> 01:27:52.220]   So you could shoot one of those things so you're saying that this isn't going to be a problem is unmanned
[01:27:52.220 --> 01:27:55.980]   Please no, it's a huge problem. It's a problem for aviation because
[01:27:55.980 --> 01:27:59.580]   You know you got these things flying. I mean, it's I mean
[01:27:59.580 --> 01:28:05.340]   Is it gonna happen in the in the air traffic, you know, it's not it's just not handy to have these things flying around
[01:28:05.340 --> 01:28:09.340]   They're not communicating the same way. This is also why they're bringing in the next gen
[01:28:09.340 --> 01:28:13.260]   Um air traffic control system, which is going to cost
[01:28:14.060 --> 01:28:17.820]   It's like some crazy amount like a hundred billion dollars. So they do want to do this
[01:28:17.820 --> 01:28:25.420]   Excuse me. They do want to do unmanned drone aircraft. Absolutely patrolling. Well, it's it's it's not unmanned
[01:28:25.420 --> 01:28:28.940]   It's uh remote manned man to be technical about it
[01:28:28.940 --> 01:28:32.780]   They will eventually have autonomous drones, which is very very frightening
[01:28:32.780 --> 01:28:38.060]   But now i'm i'm very against this this shouldn't be in our airspace at all first of all
[01:28:38.060 --> 01:28:40.620]   It's annoying because you just have these things buzzing around
[01:28:41.180 --> 01:28:46.380]   And you know the national defense authorization act is being discussed now the 2013 version
[01:28:46.380 --> 01:28:53.100]   And they're saying well if we happen to see you doing something illegal that will not be admissible in court as evidence
[01:28:53.100 --> 01:28:55.740]   But if we have a court order, they'll show you
[01:28:55.740 --> 01:29:00.860]   But you know if they have a court order then you know, they can go spy on you that well
[01:29:00.860 --> 01:29:04.700]   I gotta point out that janet and apolotano testified in congress this week
[01:29:04.700 --> 01:29:09.340]   That the she's the secretary of homeland security that we do in fact
[01:29:09.900 --> 01:29:11.900]   have un uh have uh
[01:29:11.900 --> 01:29:19.100]   Unmanned drones patrolling our borders right now. Yeah, sure we do and but they're patrolling over chicago right now
[01:29:19.100 --> 01:29:25.660]   Yeah, they they go from northern to code at the eastern washington and and the guys who are making these are saying that they're really being made to
[01:29:25.660 --> 01:29:28.220]   Detect pot growing
[01:29:28.220 --> 01:29:32.300]   Operations in your house because they'll look at the heat signatures coming off your house
[01:29:32.300 --> 01:29:35.500]   And they'll uh start keying in on ones that are
[01:29:35.500 --> 01:29:38.940]   uh, you know that are off these are predator be
[01:29:39.500 --> 01:29:41.820]   predator be drones and they can do it from an uh
[01:29:41.820 --> 01:29:46.860]   Height that is higher than where uh general aviation flies anyways, right?
[01:29:46.860 --> 01:29:51.900]   I am cashing in on this though leo how so oh, uh, I have a game show
[01:29:51.900 --> 01:29:55.740]   Yes
[01:30:08.780 --> 01:30:14.540]   Quick give me that gun at him now wasn't the impetus for the story the fact that drones on their way overseas
[01:30:14.540 --> 01:30:20.220]   Weren't supposed to have their cameras turned on while flying in the united states, but they accidentally did well
[01:30:20.220 --> 01:30:25.100]   Now these if you're in spokan good news these quote border drones are looking right at you
[01:30:25.100 --> 01:30:29.340]   Because they fly over spokan so I guess they're not turning the cameras off anymore
[01:30:29.340 --> 01:30:32.060]   I think they get 30 days
[01:30:32.060 --> 01:30:35.180]   Before they have to dump the footage but they can spend those 30 days finding
[01:30:35.580 --> 01:30:39.340]   If there's something in the footage that should have allowed them to have the cameras on
[01:30:39.340 --> 01:30:45.260]   It's a really strange long really. Yeah, this is all of this is really really disgusting
[01:30:45.260 --> 01:30:50.780]   And we we are killing innocent people in in faraway lands every single day
[01:30:50.780 --> 01:30:56.940]   With drones shooting it's you know, we have collateral damage the whole thing is is completely ridiculous
[01:30:56.940 --> 01:31:02.780]   Uh our administration gets off on it the signature strikes the whole thing is it's really frightening
[01:31:02.780 --> 01:31:05.820]   I think it's a very very very bad development
[01:31:05.820 --> 01:31:12.780]   Well, what's interesting of course is that we are moving towards a fully surveilled society where there are cameras everywhere
[01:31:12.780 --> 01:31:17.340]   There'll there'll be cameras in the sky. There'll be cameras on every street corner in the street lamps and the street lamps
[01:31:17.340 --> 01:31:19.260]   These sensors in my head and what tech
[01:31:19.260 --> 01:31:22.780]   He's got one and what technology allows of course
[01:31:22.780 --> 01:31:26.460]   You know you couldn't do this before because you couldn't hire enough people to watch all these cameras
[01:31:26.460 --> 01:31:29.260]   But technology allows with face recognition and so forth you
[01:31:30.060 --> 01:31:34.460]   Can do this all automated, but what does it look at the UK? What does it achieve? You know, nothing?
[01:31:34.460 --> 01:31:38.220]   Nothing like 1% of all crime is solved because of the
[01:31:38.220 --> 01:31:45.660]   Massive surveillance system they have with cctv, right and the cost must be this astronomical. So, you know, what is it achieve?
[01:31:45.660 --> 01:31:49.580]   We're gonna have these google glasses that are gonna tell us talk about google glasses
[01:31:49.580 --> 01:31:54.060]   As have you seen them because you were standing next to a larry page when he was wearing a circuit
[01:31:54.060 --> 01:31:56.460]   When he was wearing them, he wouldn't let you put him on them
[01:31:56.460 --> 01:31:59.740]   No, and then the latest work heard is that it just rebooted a lot
[01:31:59.740 --> 01:32:04.300]   Probably had a command line interface or something. I probably didn't do all that much
[01:32:04.300 --> 01:32:07.740]   They have patented they have patented the frames the styles
[01:32:07.740 --> 01:32:14.140]   I've heard from many that they're moving along quite briskly and that this is a real product. Is it a real product?
[01:32:14.140 --> 01:32:17.980]   I believe it will be real in the at least a year to 18 months
[01:32:17.980 --> 01:32:21.820]   And what will be the and it's not just google by the way
[01:32:21.820 --> 01:32:25.420]   Oakley is working on this other companies are working on this and the
[01:32:25.980 --> 01:32:30.540]   underlying infrastructure that will allow this contextual style display is
[01:32:30.540 --> 01:32:37.580]   Coming at us. I was just at sri where it's syri and the mouse was embedded this week and I saw something that was pretty mind-blowing
[01:32:37.580 --> 01:32:43.980]   Using no sensors using nothing external other than your gmail and your calendar to figure out your context
[01:32:43.980 --> 01:32:50.460]   Like what you're doing in a context right now. I'm on a talk show. Where are you? Don't be sending phone calls, right?
[01:32:50.460 --> 01:32:53.820]   Which rocky by the way, my producer was texting you I see this
[01:32:54.540 --> 01:32:56.540]   He called me to get on the show
[01:32:56.540 --> 01:32:58.380]   What is rocky want to talk about?
[01:32:58.380 --> 01:32:59.820]   He's always welcome on the show
[01:32:59.820 --> 01:33:01.820]   But we're in a context right if it was smart
[01:33:01.820 --> 01:33:05.500]   It would have just dumped that straight in a voicemail and not let that through the show
[01:33:05.500 --> 01:33:09.740]   Or if you had an android phone, you just flip it over and it would say oh you doesn't want to be called right now
[01:33:09.740 --> 01:33:12.300]   So um
[01:33:12.300 --> 01:33:17.260]   So as we're driving down so I'm using a an app called place me done by alohar
[01:33:17.260 --> 01:33:22.220]   They're studying my context. It knows whether I'm sitting driving walking running
[01:33:22.700 --> 01:33:27.660]   Etc. It knows my favorite gas station already because i'm gonna drone your ass so bad
[01:33:27.660 --> 01:33:33.420]   He's the first on the first casualty baby first man up against the wall when the revolution happens
[01:33:33.420 --> 01:33:35.820]   They know where uh where i'm buying my drugs
[01:33:35.820 --> 01:33:42.620]   This actually reminds me a lot of we were talking about daniel as far as in demon. This is exactly what exactly that the the augmented reality
[01:33:42.620 --> 01:33:47.820]   In that that was actually extremely cool where for those you haven't listened to the book are non-audible
[01:33:47.820 --> 01:33:51.020]   Um, you know you put these glasses on that like shades
[01:33:51.100 --> 01:33:56.700]   But above everyone's head you kind of see their uh their info and their stats if they're a part of the darknet
[01:33:56.700 --> 01:34:01.340]   Um, I would love that screw my calendar. I don't care about that. I'd love to
[01:34:01.340 --> 01:34:05.500]   Yeah, you had reputation points so I could look at robert and I could know well
[01:34:05.500 --> 01:34:10.220]   He's trustworthy and it and I can you know, I mean it would know he's shaking his head
[01:34:10.220 --> 01:34:12.860]   And I think that that would be kind of cool
[01:34:12.860 --> 01:34:20.060]   Uh, it seems to me adam that these glasses would be you would be steamer to be coming out of your ears. You do you embrace these?
[01:34:21.020 --> 01:34:23.020]   well, the
[01:34:23.020 --> 01:34:27.980]   As it is now it just looks like a stupid gimmick. Okay. Um, you're not afraid of it because it's dumb
[01:34:27.980 --> 01:34:31.580]   Yeah, oh, it's totally dumb and they're not very stylish looking
[01:34:31.580 --> 01:34:35.900]   Going along with the with the sware's book
[01:34:35.900 --> 01:34:41.900]   If there was if we were actually a part of an underground network that we were revolutionaries. It would be good
[01:34:41.900 --> 01:34:46.460]   So there you go. It's just another tool for the revolutionaries in a song
[01:34:46.620 --> 01:34:51.420]   I kind of I like it, but I feel like we're being more detached from the world as we I mean already
[01:34:51.420 --> 01:34:53.820]   Are we everybody walking around with their phone in their hand?
[01:34:53.820 --> 01:34:58.540]   Nobody's looking around at the world. Well, this way I would look at you and just see uh, yeah instead of seeing me
[01:34:58.540 --> 01:35:02.060]   You're focused on the the info graphics that are scrolling across the screen
[01:35:02.060 --> 01:35:07.580]   This is why you need a contextual system to know what kind of context you're in that you're looking at somebody and having a conversation
[01:35:07.580 --> 01:35:10.780]   So shut shut up and stop the movies and stop all the stuff
[01:35:10.780 --> 01:35:15.660]   But I do want to know about you. I you know at the world economic forum. I was talking to this guy named peter piet
[01:35:15.740 --> 01:35:19.900]   He had a badge on right. I knew his name. I knew he worked for the bill and molyne the gates foundation
[01:35:19.900 --> 01:35:24.220]   I knew he was smart because I spent three minutes talking to him and other people were talking to him
[01:35:24.220 --> 01:35:28.220]   I could tell he was much smarter than I am 160 IQ or something crazy
[01:35:28.220 --> 01:35:32.300]   But I couldn't figure out who he was right. I get away from the conversation
[01:35:32.300 --> 01:35:36.700]   Yeah, yeah, I google his name he discovered the evil of virus. It was the first hit on wikipedia
[01:35:36.700 --> 01:35:41.100]   I sure would have liked to know that while I was talking to him and yes
[01:35:41.100 --> 01:35:45.660]   And all the systems so how do you feel about hemorrhagic viruses that turn people into
[01:35:45.660 --> 01:35:49.740]   Inside out overnight. What do you think about that? That would have been and you could have had a nice conversation
[01:35:49.740 --> 01:35:52.220]   Yeah, I would have just take a little class on with that man
[01:35:52.220 --> 01:35:55.260]   How do you feel about them or magic?
[01:35:55.260 --> 01:35:57.580]   You know, I had a similar experience robert
[01:35:57.580 --> 01:36:01.980]   But kind of the other way around a couple here in austin who would come from los angeles
[01:36:01.980 --> 01:36:06.620]   We had met them and said okay have dinner and we were talking for like three hours really nice
[01:36:06.620 --> 01:36:12.700]   We had a really great conversation and then it it came out all of a sudden that for 20 years
[01:36:12.700 --> 01:36:15.820]   They'd been the top PR people for the church of Scientology
[01:36:15.820 --> 01:36:21.020]   In LA and if I'd known that going into it, I probably wouldn't have had a good time
[01:36:21.020 --> 01:36:27.260]   Or maybe you would have a different kind of good time you would have had a different time
[01:36:27.260 --> 01:36:31.260]   It would have been but don't you aren't you you'd have a little regret that you didn't know that don't you?
[01:36:31.260 --> 01:36:35.580]   No, not at all. But now I'm like I'm googling them like oh my goodness
[01:36:35.580 --> 01:36:39.420]   Think about how that's going to change social interactions though
[01:36:39.580 --> 01:36:41.580]   I mean now you're going to be sitting at a table
[01:36:41.580 --> 01:36:47.820]   Wondering if the person across from you has glasses like your glasses and you're googling each other and trying to pick out phrase words and questions
[01:36:47.820 --> 01:36:53.340]   From what your search it makes me a little nervous. I have a feel I just feels like we're going to get more detached not more engaged
[01:36:53.340 --> 01:36:59.100]   I'm down with that and also glasses hide the most important function of your eyebrows
[01:36:59.100 --> 01:37:06.540]   Seriously that you know the eyebrows or what what you use to communicate more than your speech
[01:37:07.660 --> 01:37:13.260]   You know, it's interesting Charlie just said interesting Charlie just said in the chat room that you'll be able to cross check
[01:37:13.260 --> 01:37:16.700]   Whether somebody's lying to you or not. It was interesting at the next web
[01:37:16.700 --> 01:37:21.660]   I was giving us a speech and I was wearing a sensor for my galvanic skin response
[01:37:21.660 --> 01:37:29.180]   And it was studying my emotions as I was giving the speech and somebody the guy who invented these was standing off to off to the side
[01:37:29.180 --> 01:37:32.620]   Watching in real time on his iphone my emotions
[01:37:33.100 --> 01:37:38.060]   And that is exactly true. You're going to be able to know if I knew that information about you
[01:37:38.060 --> 01:37:41.660]   I would be able to tell whether you're having a weird emotional
[01:37:41.660 --> 01:37:47.580]   Response to what you're saying to me and I would know that you're lying or you could just like observe and notice people
[01:37:47.580 --> 01:37:52.540]   But I will agree with you leo that this and this actually and I just read it now
[01:37:52.540 --> 01:37:55.340]   Don't take this the wrong way because I'm a student of history
[01:37:55.340 --> 01:38:02.140]   But for a number of reasons I read uh Ted kazinsky's manifesto the unibomber. Yes
[01:38:02.780 --> 01:38:07.420]   And actually that must have been fascinating if not it was it's it's was very fascinating
[01:38:07.420 --> 01:38:12.060]   And I never read it and you know there was a documentary that I saw I'm like, I should I should check this out
[01:38:12.060 --> 01:38:18.220]   And he said, you know technology essentially is going to entrap us and we'll make us less free
[01:38:18.220 --> 01:38:21.660]   And I think that's probably what you're kind of hinting at yes
[01:38:21.660 --> 01:38:26.860]   Yes, I believe that technology does totally entraps us and makes us a lot less
[01:38:26.860 --> 01:38:30.220]   Free as the word as human beings so well
[01:38:30.780 --> 01:38:35.820]   Humanization of technology is not necessarily a good thing now. I like it and I use it
[01:38:35.820 --> 01:38:38.940]   Uh, but we do have to be a little wary. I think I agree. I think wary
[01:38:38.940 --> 01:38:42.380]   I think technology is fairly neutral most technologies are fairly neutral
[01:38:42.380 --> 01:38:45.340]   It's up to us to contextualize it to say whether it's good or bad
[01:38:45.340 --> 01:38:50.460]   But it's certainly important that we be aware of its pitfalls the problem is it's seductive, isn't it?
[01:38:50.460 --> 01:38:54.700]   And so we love it and we and we are into it and so we often just kind of
[01:38:54.700 --> 01:38:57.660]   uh brush over the negative impacts
[01:38:58.060 --> 01:39:03.260]   I think that's the real problem with the this facebook-ish world or this google glasses world
[01:39:03.260 --> 01:39:07.580]   Is that uh, it's going to addict us and the addiction is already happening
[01:39:07.580 --> 01:39:09.900]   Right, we're already seeing people texting and driving
[01:39:09.900 --> 01:39:12.060]   We're already people cannot put their phone away
[01:39:12.060 --> 01:39:15.020]   We're already seeing marriages break up because people are staring into their phones
[01:39:15.020 --> 01:39:20.140]   Instead of talking to each other and this is just going to get worse and worse as these systems get better at serving us
[01:39:20.140 --> 01:39:23.500]   Everything not just media not just ads but everything in the world
[01:39:23.500 --> 01:39:26.460]   That's one of the fundamental things about this particular revolution
[01:39:26.780 --> 01:39:30.300]   Versus say like the industrial revolution of the last, you know century
[01:39:30.300 --> 01:39:36.060]   When you look at the it revolution the information technology revolution, it's not just another tool
[01:39:36.060 --> 01:39:41.260]   Which we used to communicate it has fundamentally changed the way that we relate to one another and to society
[01:39:41.260 --> 01:39:45.580]   Uh, so now you've got something like the google glasses, which admittedly as a geek
[01:39:45.580 --> 01:39:50.060]   I would love to have something like that. I really would but I think you're both right
[01:39:50.060 --> 01:39:54.140]   It's something that pushes me away from somebody else and now I am actually
[01:39:54.860 --> 01:39:58.620]   Having a conversation with someone accessing an external memory at the same time
[01:39:58.620 --> 01:40:01.500]   I'm not really engaging this person as myself
[01:40:01.500 --> 01:40:07.260]   I've been I've been hearing this argument for 30 years about the computer world is going to disconnect us
[01:40:07.260 --> 01:40:10.620]   And yet i've traveled more and met more people
[01:40:10.620 --> 01:40:13.420]   I've hung out in a tower records without him curry
[01:40:13.420 --> 01:40:17.900]   I'm I wouldn't have had that experience if it wasn't for the internet and the computer systems
[01:40:17.900 --> 01:40:21.580]   Yes that we built absolutely but now tower records is gone. Thanks to the internet
[01:40:21.580 --> 01:40:25.500]   So you can never again we can never again have that experience, but it's in our memories
[01:40:25.500 --> 01:40:29.660]   I can't tell you how many times I've been in an exotic location for my job
[01:40:29.660 --> 01:40:34.060]   And I'm looking at something beautiful and next to me is you know
[01:40:34.060 --> 01:40:37.500]   Some 17-year-old girl from the United States who was there with her parents
[01:40:37.500 --> 01:40:41.340]   And she's taking a picture of something and putting it on twitter and she never looks up
[01:40:41.340 --> 01:40:47.500]   And you know, that's it's weird to me. I'm I but I see that's normal for her
[01:40:47.980 --> 01:40:52.060]   It's not enough to see something she has to be able to share it. She has to be able to communicate it to others
[01:40:52.060 --> 01:40:55.660]   Otherwise, it's not a real experience. I don't think that's good
[01:40:55.660 --> 01:41:01.820]   And you know, yeah, I've been hearing for a long as long as you that computers are going to take over and we're going to become a ton
[01:41:01.820 --> 01:41:04.380]   automatons we're not going to be able to talk to one another
[01:41:04.380 --> 01:41:08.060]   But you know, it's happening a little at a time. It's a thousand cuts here
[01:41:08.060 --> 01:41:15.100]   J after all that. I hardly really want to talk about a 15 inch macbook pro that has a retina display
[01:41:16.140 --> 01:41:18.140]   So trivial
[01:41:18.140 --> 01:41:20.860]   This is the mountain goat
[01:41:20.860 --> 01:41:24.300]   That's the new that's the next OS 10 mountain goat, huh?
[01:41:24.300 --> 01:41:32.060]   Looks a little bit like Ubuntu. This is the original macbook air running Ubuntu. That's what I thought. Okay. It looks like a 12 or 1204. Yeah
[01:41:32.060 --> 01:41:36.140]   Yep, I love it lucid links or whatever it's called
[01:41:36.140 --> 01:41:40.300]   No, the macbook is going to bring everyone together though. See that's different
[01:41:41.660 --> 01:41:46.300]   I do think that a super high-res displays pretty cool USB 3 ultra thin design
[01:41:46.300 --> 01:41:50.860]   The ultra thin design the USB 3 actually has me
[01:41:50.860 --> 01:41:54.460]   More interested than anything really now. You're you're an it guy
[01:41:54.460 --> 01:42:00.860]   It's a guy in and the USB 3 is is predominant in pcs, but it has not made its way to the apple side yet
[01:42:00.860 --> 01:42:06.060]   Right in fact apple. I thought was going to try to end around USB 3 with thunderbolt
[01:42:06.060 --> 01:42:10.700]   But thunderbolt has not taken off. It's much faster than USB 3. It's faster than you is not stuff
[01:42:10.780 --> 01:42:13.500]   But it's limited and it's expensive and it's very expensive
[01:42:13.500 --> 01:42:21.260]   By the way, the photo of me and Adam walking around the tower records is gone because the service I used to put it on text america
[01:42:21.260 --> 01:42:25.420]   I love it. You know those guys they have to be pissed off instagram sells for a billion dollars
[01:42:25.420 --> 01:42:27.420]   They invented that 10 years ago
[01:42:27.420 --> 01:42:35.420]   With mow blogs remember mow blogs. How do we remember mow blogs? Yeah, sure. That's instagram is a mow blog. Yep
[01:42:35.420 --> 01:42:37.980]   You know my my daughter
[01:42:37.980 --> 01:42:40.140]   is uh 21 and
[01:42:40.700 --> 01:42:45.180]   And her all her friends, you know as I said, you know, I we communicate a lot with them and the minute
[01:42:45.180 --> 01:42:50.460]   Instagram was bought their first reaction was ah, it's gonna suck right
[01:42:50.460 --> 01:42:56.300]   Really interesting, but but let me ask you did she say the same thing when they released an android client
[01:42:56.300 --> 01:43:04.860]   Um her boyfriend did yeah, he said oh now it's gonna not gonna be exclusive and small anymore tells you tells you a little bit about who uses instagram
[01:43:04.860 --> 01:43:10.060]   Oh god now remember with you remember this Adam remember what aol opened up the internet
[01:43:10.060 --> 01:43:13.420]   To its users. It was sure it was the summer of uh
[01:43:13.420 --> 01:43:17.820]   Everybody was on the internet the time, which wasn't the 95. Yeah
[01:43:17.820 --> 01:43:24.940]   Yeah, and you remember they had the crazy caching and it would take like four hours if you updated a webpage for aol
[01:43:24.940 --> 01:43:29.340]   To actually display it. That's right. They weren't showing it live. They led in the unwashed masses
[01:43:29.340 --> 01:43:35.660]   That's exactly and the and the same reaction is the instagram users when the intran was added and then when instagram got sold to facebook
[01:43:35.900 --> 01:43:40.940]   It's very similar. It's like oh no now here come the real people and that's what we're saying on google plus right now
[01:43:40.940 --> 01:43:44.140]   Oh, don't fortunately. They didn't they never showed
[01:43:44.140 --> 01:43:53.020]   No, and that's what's fun about google plus right? We we almost I almost have stopped talking because I don't want to screw up the right private club
[01:43:53.020 --> 01:43:53.820]   Yeah, i'm telling you
[01:43:53.820 --> 01:43:57.500]   Well, it's like that's why I use t-mobile because I think it's being three other people on that network
[01:43:57.500 --> 01:44:01.820]   It's perfect good network. It never goes down. You go to a conference and t-mobile works
[01:44:02.940 --> 01:44:08.340]   All right, we're gonna take a break adam curry is here the pod father the host of no agenda show with john c to voreg
[01:44:08.340 --> 01:44:10.460]   It's crackpot and buzz kill
[01:44:10.460 --> 01:44:16.220]   At no agenda show.com and I didn't know but many other shows are used is me view. What's going on with me?
[01:44:16.220 --> 01:44:17.980]   Yo, you're still at me view right?
[01:44:17.980 --> 01:44:21.900]   Uh, well i'm a shareholder and i'm on the board. Uh, you're not active there though
[01:44:21.900 --> 01:44:27.260]   No two years ago. I decided that I really just wanted to do no agenda full-time and wow
[01:44:27.260 --> 01:44:29.820]   I didn't really want to be a part of
[01:44:30.540 --> 01:44:34.140]   Just it was not what I wanted to do. Um, it's a real business
[01:44:34.140 --> 01:44:39.500]   CEO and my ex partner ron bloom is actually he's taken in an interesting direction. They're opening up a
[01:44:39.500 --> 01:44:46.460]   Live studio in hollywood in the w and they've uh put together a deal with
[01:44:46.460 --> 01:44:55.340]   jean kirkwood was a producer who did the original uh rocky and uh, they're they're trying to they're trying to do something
[01:44:55.340 --> 01:44:56.940]   They're trying to bridge
[01:44:56.940 --> 01:45:00.220]   You know hollywood and and silicon valleys. It's uh
[01:45:00.700 --> 01:45:08.540]   Entried many times, uh, but you know bloom is pretty persistent. So I have a faith in that but I really have no other
[01:45:08.540 --> 01:45:13.340]   That's so but so they don't do no agenda show or any of your other shows or no
[01:45:13.340 --> 01:45:20.460]   Yeah, it's on their servers and it runs through. Um, it does. Uh, yeah runs through there. I also put the big book show on there
[01:45:20.460 --> 01:45:23.260]   But it's just you know, I'm a good shareholder
[01:45:23.260 --> 01:45:26.780]   That's interesting. Is it the the hollywood w?
[01:45:27.900 --> 01:45:31.740]   Yeah, it's right there in hollywood and vine they've uh, yeah, that's a retail space
[01:45:31.740 --> 01:45:36.940]   It's a very interesting idea because I know there's some other shows that operate out of hollywood hotels
[01:45:36.940 --> 01:45:42.300]   The idea being well the stars are there anyway. So maybe they'll come into a podcast. You know what kevin pollock told me
[01:45:42.300 --> 01:45:45.180]   Uh, he said uh, he said
[01:45:45.180 --> 01:45:49.660]   What was it? Oh now I can't remember he likened the podcasts
[01:45:49.660 --> 01:45:52.780]   Oh, I'm gonna have to oh I forgot it. Oh well
[01:45:53.420 --> 01:45:57.420]   It was an omism. Yeah, uh, there was it was a good analogy
[01:45:57.420 --> 01:46:02.300]   He said the podcasts in hollywood. It's kind of the uh, it's kind of like an obligation that you don't want to do
[01:46:02.300 --> 01:46:07.180]   Had a good analogy, but you know, there's a couple of really really successful ones. You know, jury duty
[01:46:07.180 --> 01:46:14.300]   That's it podcast of the jury duty. Thank you chatroom. They're my mind. You know, I've outsourced my entire this is your google glasses
[01:46:14.300 --> 01:46:18.060]   outsourced my brains exactly what it's gonna be like, right?
[01:46:18.220 --> 01:46:24.140]   We're gonna have the leo lefort army in our glasses. He said in hollywood hollywood doing a podcast is like jury duty
[01:46:24.140 --> 01:46:26.860]   You'd like hope you don't get the invitation. Oh crap
[01:46:26.860 --> 01:46:31.260]   Now what do I corolla does very well joe rogan does very well, uh,
[01:46:31.260 --> 01:46:37.980]   What's the uh, was the comedian well kevin pollock? He does a great to the kevin pollock chat show. He's doing very good
[01:46:37.980 --> 01:46:41.740]   Oh, you think of mark moron and uh mark moron exactly and yeah, yeah, yeah
[01:46:41.740 --> 01:46:46.620]   he does great of course a variation of that was uh, uh,
[01:46:47.820 --> 01:46:54.140]   Louis ck, yep, you know and uh, and Kevin smith does very well with the show. He said hey, you know, uh,
[01:46:54.140 --> 01:46:58.380]   Here's my my stand-up special and uh, it's for free
[01:46:58.380 --> 01:47:03.420]   You know, 75 bucks if you like it and I think he did a million dollars in the most cases though
[01:47:03.420 --> 01:47:07.740]   I think these uh hollywood podcasts are people who are someone on the margins anyway
[01:47:07.740 --> 01:47:11.740]   They're not you know, you're not you're not tom cruises. I like we're so mainstream
[01:47:12.940 --> 01:47:18.140]   Well, that's what i'm saying. It's not mainstream. But seriously what you know, this is where
[01:47:18.140 --> 01:47:22.540]   This is where it's going. It's meeting somewhere in the middle. We have alternative media
[01:47:22.540 --> 01:47:27.020]   It has nowhere to go but up. I mean, have you seen the ratings for cnn as an example?
[01:47:27.020 --> 01:47:34.780]   Well, they're not great morgan 39,000 people that's all that watch that show what during sweep's week 39th in the demo
[01:47:34.780 --> 01:47:42.700]   So 25 to 55 39,000 people I believe that i'm watching i'm on fox news a lot in the mornings and I get no fox news
[01:47:43.100 --> 01:47:45.260]   Fox news, uh, they're doing better. Well, they do it
[01:47:45.260 --> 01:47:46.460]   But it's like 2 million
[01:47:46.460 --> 01:47:50.220]   But I don't believe that the people there are very engaged. They're not very
[01:47:50.220 --> 01:47:54.060]   That's the truth. We have 4 million viewers every time I do live with bridges and kelly
[01:47:54.060 --> 01:47:56.700]   They have hot chick every time I do live with kelly now
[01:47:56.700 --> 01:47:59.980]   4 million people I know are watching that's the numbers. It's a big number
[01:47:59.980 --> 01:48:04.060]   Nothing doesn't move the meter at all. I don't hear from anybody because they're not no
[01:48:04.060 --> 01:48:08.860]   I agreed they're just kind of it. It's just because people watch television and i'm not trying to be ages
[01:48:08.860 --> 01:48:13.500]   But people who watch television are over 50 just look at the ads. What are they selling?
[01:48:13.500 --> 01:48:16.860]   How old are you Adam? I'll be i'll be 48 in September
[01:48:16.860 --> 01:48:20.860]   Hey
[01:48:20.860 --> 01:48:26.700]   Now you're being ageist two years Adam two years and then i'll talk to you get off of my lawn you kids
[01:48:26.700 --> 01:48:31.180]   Just baby face. Look at what they're selling man. They're selling syallas. You know, I agree
[01:48:31.180 --> 01:48:35.900]   No, it's very it's depends and yeah, it's really interesting when you watch cnn or any of these
[01:48:36.540 --> 01:48:40.940]   Um, and yet when there's a war that's what people tune into right they do that's traditionally
[01:48:40.940 --> 01:48:47.900]   Whether they can't run ads right. Yeah, they can't break away because right the wars too exciting anderson pooper on the front line
[01:48:47.900 --> 01:48:50.300]   Right. That's very good. That's a very good point
[01:48:50.300 --> 01:48:54.220]   This show brought to you today by fresh books.com if you're a small business
[01:48:54.220 --> 01:48:57.660]   You know the worst thing the worst time of the month at the end of the month when you got an invoice
[01:48:57.660 --> 01:48:59.180]   When you got to send out those bills
[01:48:59.180 --> 01:49:03.340]   It's just a pain in the bunch of fire up microsoft word and you type in a type
[01:49:04.140 --> 01:49:07.260]   In 2004 I found fresh books.com
[01:49:07.260 --> 01:49:10.940]   It was actually amber macarthur introduced them to me when we were I was going up there to do a tv show
[01:49:10.940 --> 01:49:16.460]   It's a toronto company and she said look because I said I I keep forgetting the invoice. I'm not getting paid
[01:49:16.460 --> 01:49:18.780]   she said fresh books.com and
[01:49:18.780 --> 01:49:25.580]   Three and a half million people now have followed in my footsteps and are using fresh books to send out their invoices
[01:49:25.580 --> 01:49:28.060]   They're professional looking they're crisp crisp
[01:49:28.060 --> 01:49:33.820]   They look that you get paid faster because there's a button right on the email that says pay this guy and
[01:49:34.060 --> 01:49:36.620]   The truth is your clients. It's not that they don't want to pay you
[01:49:36.620 --> 01:49:41.260]   They just kind of make it easy for them so they can use a credit card or one of 11 different online
[01:49:41.260 --> 01:49:44.940]   Authorization services to pay you right on the spot including PayPal
[01:49:44.940 --> 01:49:49.980]   If you do time and hours they have an app an iPhone app
[01:49:49.980 --> 01:49:52.940]   But you also have a web based app that will do the time and hours
[01:49:52.940 --> 01:49:56.620]   And then just it goes right into the into the invoice
[01:49:56.620 --> 01:50:01.100]   They have automatic ticklers. So if you know you don't get paid for 30 60 or 90 days
[01:50:01.100 --> 01:50:04.700]   They'll automatically send out the invoice again and remind people and let them know hey
[01:50:04.700 --> 01:50:10.620]   We're paying attention in fact. They'll even a lot of consultants who use this they love it. Isn't it great? It's just really nice
[01:50:10.620 --> 01:50:15.660]   They'll even send out for if you have an old-fashioned client. They'll even print stamp and mail a
[01:50:15.660 --> 01:50:18.300]   Apprinted invoice for you for an additional fee
[01:50:18.300 --> 01:50:21.980]   Um, it is I've tried a number of these services. I used fresh books
[01:50:21.980 --> 01:50:25.100]   I don't have to do it anymore because I I do have a staff, but if you're a small business
[01:50:25.100 --> 01:50:28.860]   You're doing this yourself. This is a great solution fresh books
[01:50:29.500 --> 01:50:36.220]   Dot com try it right now 30 days of unlimited use and just make sure you tell them you heard it about it on twit
[01:50:36.220 --> 01:50:38.300]   Okay, fresh books
[01:50:38.300 --> 01:50:44.460]   Dot com don't do that in voicing by hand anymore. You the faster you do it the faster you get paid
[01:50:44.460 --> 01:50:50.140]   Yeah, you I'm telling you just try it for a month and if you don't get more money in that first month forget it
[01:50:50.140 --> 01:50:52.940]   fresh books dot com
[01:50:52.940 --> 01:50:55.500]   Are you ready for 802.11 a c yeah?
[01:50:55.980 --> 01:51:00.140]   You are I just got a buffalo router does this new 802.11. It's a c
[01:51:00.140 --> 01:51:06.700]   Have you heard about this? Absolutely a c as a bonding of the five gigahertz channels up to eight for 160 megahertz
[01:51:06.700 --> 01:51:13.820]   To get you up to 1.3 gigabits of transfer over multiple devices or 500 megabits per second over a single device
[01:51:13.820 --> 01:51:18.540]   So it's it's much more than twice as fast as 802. Oh much faster. How you remember all that?
[01:51:21.260 --> 01:51:26.940]   Yes, another thing that's super cool. It has adaptive antennaeaning so when it starts to talk to so i'm sitting here
[01:51:26.940 --> 01:51:32.620]   My wife access point is over here. I'm talking you're doing your phone right now. It says oh roberts having a conversation it narrows
[01:51:32.620 --> 01:51:36.060]   It's beam. It's no longer omnidirectional to the people it's talking to
[01:51:36.060 --> 01:51:41.660]   Which is kind of amazing right all of this because the 2.4 gigahertz band is crazy crowded
[01:51:41.660 --> 01:51:45.740]   Unusably crowded we couldn't use the standard routers even in here
[01:51:46.300 --> 01:51:51.500]   We had a we had an upgrade to higher end routers in fact you're going to give us this is it serious zero zero
[01:51:51.500 --> 01:51:53.900]   It's essentially a souped up version of that
[01:51:53.900 --> 01:51:59.260]   It's it's a uh looks like a flying saucer and it divides the 360 degrees into multiple slices
[01:51:59.260 --> 01:52:01.740]   With radios pointed in just that direction
[01:52:01.740 --> 01:52:07.420]   Now the the problem with the 2.4 gigahertz range and on the chat realm knows this is there's really only three channels
[01:52:07.420 --> 01:52:11.100]   They say 11, but it's three it's one six and 11
[01:52:11.100 --> 01:52:14.940]   If you put if you put your Wi-Fi in any other channel, you're really just straddling channels
[01:52:15.500 --> 01:52:19.260]   And 2.4 gigahertz has several problems first it propagates well through walls
[01:52:19.260 --> 01:52:24.700]   Which means if I have a access point in my house, it's interfering with the access point in my neighbor's house
[01:52:24.700 --> 01:52:29.260]   Exactly and also with just the three channels. That's congested now. That's interesting because you're making a
[01:52:29.260 --> 01:52:34.220]   Benefit out of what could be a problem because as you get to higher frequencies it bounces off things
[01:52:34.220 --> 01:52:37.100]   So five gigahertz is not going to go through walls as well
[01:52:37.100 --> 01:52:41.980]   Right, that's great if your neighbors are impinging on you, but it's not so great if you have a home with multiple rooms
[01:52:41.980 --> 01:52:44.380]   Are there solutions around
[01:52:44.380 --> 01:52:45.980]   That would a bridge up or yeah
[01:52:45.980 --> 01:52:50.700]   Well, that's actually one of the things that I've been hearing from some of the silicon valley press
[01:52:50.700 --> 01:52:54.620]   And that is that the arrival of a see the you know the coming of age of the five gigahertz
[01:52:54.620 --> 01:52:59.580]   Wi-Fi devices is going to do the five gigahertz what it what happened to 2.4
[01:52:59.580 --> 01:53:00.780]   It's just going to be just as crowded
[01:53:00.780 --> 01:53:07.340]   But that's not true because it doesn't propagate right so you can have an access point in each room and it will not interfere with one another
[01:53:07.340 --> 01:53:10.060]   So yeah, I mean now we'll need to upgrade
[01:53:10.140 --> 01:53:14.220]   I mean it does it's downward compatible a b c and g and n are all working, but
[01:53:14.220 --> 01:53:18.860]   You you will want to get all of these benefits to use an a c
[01:53:18.860 --> 01:53:21.340]   adapter on your machine
[01:53:21.340 --> 01:53:25.020]   Correct, how's how long before notebooks and desktops or whatever come out with it?
[01:53:25.020 --> 01:53:26.700]   The problem is it's draft
[01:53:26.700 --> 01:53:31.100]   It's like when draft n first came out and it's gonna be draft for at least another year
[01:53:31.100 --> 01:53:33.580]   I mean, it's the one it's way early. This is way early
[01:53:33.580 --> 01:53:37.500]   This was buffalo and net gear fighting it out to see who could make it to market first
[01:53:37.500 --> 01:53:41.600]   I think they were within three hours of one another net gears are
[01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:44.300]   6300 just came out the buffalo
[01:53:44.300 --> 01:53:50.620]   802 let's see a router is called the ac 1300 I have that home and I set it up and
[01:53:50.620 --> 01:53:55.180]   Now the problem is your internet access isn't any faster unless you have such fast internet that it's
[01:53:55.180 --> 01:53:58.060]   Challenging 802 11n which most people don't
[01:53:58.060 --> 01:54:03.740]   But if you're sharing files over the network, I did notice a big boost there. That's an amazing thing
[01:54:03.980 --> 01:54:08.780]   So for instance one of the things I do I'll give you just a second one of the things I do is
[01:54:08.780 --> 01:54:13.340]   I have it has a usb port so I put a hard drive on it and make that a nass
[01:54:13.340 --> 01:54:18.540]   And that way it's a much faster backup solution than if I were doing it over the normal Wi-Fi, right?
[01:54:18.540 --> 01:54:23.100]   Exactly go ahead. I'm sorry. Well, the padre seems to know a lot about it. I'm very interested. I'm
[01:54:23.100 --> 01:54:28.220]   How about the are there any health concerns with these frequencies? I'm gonna have to be honest
[01:54:28.220 --> 01:54:32.940]   I'm thinking more of going wired than than more signals in the house
[01:54:33.020 --> 01:54:35.900]   I mean is it is that stuff even research at all?
[01:54:35.900 --> 01:54:40.140]   Yes, I'm actually much more concerned about 802 11b
[01:54:40.140 --> 01:54:45.100]   gn at 2.4 gigahertz because that's the same frequency as your microwave
[01:54:45.100 --> 01:54:50.060]   That gets absorbed by the water molecules in your body five gigahertz actually just bounces right off
[01:54:50.060 --> 01:54:56.540]   Uh, so the five gigahertz is actually better than you but I'm with also very low power. We're just talking super low
[01:54:56.540 --> 01:55:02.060]   You know, we're not taking me to a watt. I mean, yeah, so I mean your microwave is hundreds of watts
[01:55:02.700 --> 01:55:05.500]   Thousands clearly you don't want to put your head in the microwave
[01:55:05.500 --> 01:55:07.900]   But you don't have to your Wi-Fi access spot if it's not
[01:55:07.900 --> 01:55:14.540]   Pointed at your brain, you know millimeters away is not your it's it attenuates very very fast, right?
[01:55:14.540 --> 01:55:18.540]   Right, but I mean then you you have people who hold Wi-Fi phones up to the side
[01:55:18.540 --> 01:55:23.180]   You know, you know, I know I have actually a friend who got all the Wi-Fi out of their house
[01:55:23.180 --> 01:55:27.340]   Because they were so concerned about it and as far as I can I can see there's no evidence whatsoever
[01:55:27.340 --> 01:55:31.180]   That that's I mean they're through the the body scanners at the airport
[01:55:31.420 --> 01:55:36.140]   Right the microwave millimeter wave scanners hundreds of times a year. I opt out. I don't go through them
[01:55:36.140 --> 01:55:39.180]   Well, I like this. I like a good frisking as much as anybody, but I
[01:55:39.180 --> 01:55:41.980]   Usually I'm in more of a hurry
[01:55:41.980 --> 01:55:45.900]   When that whole bruja ha ha came out and people were saying oh my god, they're gonna see what I look naked
[01:55:45.900 --> 01:55:52.620]   I'm gonna say well look. I'm celibate. I'm almost 40 years old if someone gets their jaws off of watching a cartoon version of me naked
[01:55:52.620 --> 01:55:58.780]   I'm flattered great. Well, the real problem is it's all security theater. We know that it doesn't do anything
[01:55:58.780 --> 01:56:05.980]   They didn't didn't they announced a couple of weeks ago that they the al-kaida had developed an underwear bomb that was completely
[01:56:05.980 --> 01:56:11.980]   implanted in the body. Oh, yeah, it's in the body and an in body bomb that was completely undetectable
[01:56:11.980 --> 01:56:18.460]   So this isn't this has never been about detecting explosive is about reassuring you that we're doing everything we can
[01:56:18.460 --> 01:56:23.820]   Guy Kawasaki and I visit San Quentin and the inmates there said we can get anything in here
[01:56:23.820 --> 01:56:29.160]   We want of course and if that can happen you're gonna get things to security if you're really determined
[01:56:29.160 --> 01:56:33.440]   I saw Daniel Bristol Lapsky was there too. What were you guys up to? Well, they were there for something separate
[01:56:33.440 --> 01:56:38.900]   I we were I call it the taxpayer tour CR our money is being spent you're actually allowed to just say hey
[01:56:38.900 --> 01:56:43.340]   I want to visit well we had a friend who got us in there. Yeah, and guys gotta be careful
[01:56:43.340 --> 01:56:45.340]   Sometimes you get in and you can't get out
[01:56:45.340 --> 01:56:47.340]   Let me care with goddess in there
[01:56:47.340 --> 01:56:52.580]   Well, and I can get you the disclaimer well the disclaimer they read you when you go in
[01:56:52.580 --> 01:56:56.420]   They said they said we will not try to negotiate it for you. We will not negotiate
[01:56:56.420 --> 01:56:59.100]   Your freedom for prisoners
[01:56:59.100 --> 01:57:04.660]   Yeah, if they if they take you hostage say goodbye because we're not gonna try to we're not gonna save you you're on your own
[01:57:04.660 --> 01:57:06.340]   Good luck
[01:57:06.340 --> 01:57:11.120]   There's a guy named bull who has your name tattooed on his forehead. It's a just one of you know
[01:57:11.120 --> 01:57:16.900]   Anyway, so I'm excited about this 82.11 AC were more than you're off from it's but it's a draft standard
[01:57:16.900 --> 01:57:19.300]   But like the end standard there are early
[01:57:19.820 --> 01:57:24.820]   Model's I was impressed. I was getting very good results with the Buffalo. I'm gonna test it more
[01:57:24.820 --> 01:57:30.120]   I mean I just had it for a day and see overall, but it's also a nice router for other reasons. I mean, it's
[01:57:30.120 --> 01:57:35.300]   Unfortunately has WPS. Yes, which is flawed. Yeah, what is that?
[01:57:35.300 --> 01:57:44.180]   So all routers many routers that have a six digit token on the back that allow you to easily bond with a router, you know
[01:57:44.180 --> 01:57:46.900]   Buffalo calls it a OSS
[01:57:47.540 --> 01:57:52.020]   This WPS was improperly implemented in these routers and it's trivial
[01:57:52.020 --> 01:57:59.060]   To download software that will allow you on a WPS enabled router to get the WPA password and get in
[01:57:59.060 --> 01:58:01.380]   in a minute or two
[01:58:01.380 --> 01:58:06.260]   So it's a huge security flaw if you have a router that has WPS you should turn it off immediately
[01:58:06.260 --> 01:58:12.700]   And unfortunately the links this routers vysys go they have an on off switch, but it doesn't turn it off
[01:58:12.700 --> 01:58:16.400]   So you're in fact complete your vulnerable no matter what it turns off the light
[01:58:17.400 --> 01:58:21.020]   That's they thought that's what you meant. Oh, you don't want to see the light
[01:58:21.020 --> 01:58:24.720]   Firmware updates are being pushed out. It's an easy fix as it turns out
[01:58:24.720 --> 01:58:29.880]   So Steve Gibson's talked a lot about this flaw on a security app. You want to know more to go back to security
[01:58:29.880 --> 01:58:33.800]   What a great show that is I love to do it. Yeah, Adam a flattered
[01:58:33.800 --> 01:58:39.640]   No, you guys have a good report. It's a good. It's entertaining. Well, it's the geekiest show we do
[01:58:39.640 --> 01:58:41.240]   I know you're you know, you're a hardcore geek
[01:58:41.240 --> 01:58:45.960]   I don't know people know but Adam was started one of the first Internet service providers in the world metaverse and
[01:58:46.240 --> 01:58:51.080]   It's always been a geek in fact. I I had a gopher server back in the day
[01:58:51.080 --> 01:58:54.560]   Yeah, then that's saying a lot if you had your own gopher server
[01:58:54.560 --> 01:59:00.120]   And also registered the domain MTV before anybody knew that there would be some value
[01:59:00.120 --> 01:59:04.880]   Well, no MTV said that's all right, son. You go do that. We got the keyword on AOL
[01:59:04.880 --> 01:59:14.660]   Or the Facebook page either one just as good as good well, thank you Adam
[01:59:14.660 --> 01:59:19.420]   I appreciate I'm glad you like that. Oh, there's the Sun. It is slightly encroached
[01:59:19.420 --> 01:59:24.000]   This is a live view. Where are you getting this from?
[01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:30.080]   Chad this is from slew calm. Oh, yeah, SL O OH
[01:59:30.080 --> 01:59:34.040]   Yes calm events dot slew calm
[01:59:34.040 --> 01:59:38.140]   And they even have a live Google Hangout if you want to watch
[01:59:38.140 --> 01:59:44.240]   But of course you don't because you're watching us that what you can go there after the show that is a really that is very
[01:59:44.240 --> 01:59:45.820]   Very cool
[01:59:45.820 --> 01:59:50.180]   And I'm not sure what location now that's in California. This is California
[01:59:50.180 --> 01:59:53.340]   Yeah, it doesn't have the exact location, but I believe it's an observatory
[01:59:53.340 --> 01:59:57.700]   So in the US, it's a swath a kind of roughly diagonal swath from Oregon to Albuquerque
[01:59:57.700 --> 02:00:04.220]   You'll be able to see the totality this which is in total because it's an annular eclipse the the disk of the moon will be
[02:00:04.220 --> 02:00:10.940]   Slightly smaller than the Sun. So it's actually maybe even cooler because it's a ring of fire around the Sun
[02:00:10.940 --> 02:00:16.480]   But it's pretty bright still and we will get sunset at least in some of these areas of the Sun
[02:00:16.480 --> 02:00:21.800]   So that's that's can we see it here? Are you seeing it here? Let me let me go look. I've got the
[02:00:21.800 --> 02:00:25.400]   Level 10
[02:00:25.400 --> 02:00:30.440]   If I come back blind let me know let's check in with the with the Tom Merritt see what's going on in the week ahead
[02:00:30.440 --> 02:00:32.560]   And I'm gonna go go outside and see if I can see the Sun
[02:00:32.560 --> 02:00:37.800]   Hey, thanks Leo. Here's a look at the week ahead and we'll be covering some of these stories on tech news today
[02:00:38.040 --> 02:00:45.840]   Monday May 21st tech crunch disrupt kicks off in New York City after a weekend of hacking also Apple and Samsung CEOs are set to talk
[02:00:45.840 --> 02:00:54.140]   patent settlements and the freedom to connect conference kicks off Tuesday May 22nd Dell reports their earnings whatever they may be and

[02:01:08.020 --> 02:01:10.020]   week back to you Leo
[02:01:10.020 --> 02:01:12.420]   So it's pretty bright
[02:01:12.420 --> 02:01:14.820]   This is not enough
[02:01:14.820 --> 02:01:21.740]   I'm not kidding. It really is brighter than you think and it is not there's no I can't I couldn't I can hardly see it all now
[02:01:21.740 --> 02:01:23.740]   but I
[02:01:23.740 --> 02:01:27.540]   There wasn't a little the little notch notch bit out of it yet
[02:01:27.540 --> 02:01:31.300]   Better to watch it on sloot on the be honest with you
[02:01:31.300 --> 02:01:36.140]   I did I really I went out the door and I looked and but that's a much better view
[02:01:36.340 --> 02:01:42.420]   Actually, we're lucky because what we did is we took the a twit cottage up into a space about five miles
[02:01:42.420 --> 02:01:45.940]   And that is the view you get I think it's just much more spectacular that way
[02:01:45.940 --> 02:01:50.220]   Poor I think he just had an aneurysm
[02:01:50.220 --> 02:01:59.580]   Happens when you hit 48 I got a warn you oh man don't hurt me like that Leo 48 not yet September September
[02:01:59.580 --> 02:02:04.140]   You're these couple you a couple months ahead of me. You're the eternal boy man Adam
[02:02:05.300 --> 02:02:09.940]   That's so kind of you to say if you it's like when Dick Clark died. I thought well that can't be he's
[02:02:09.940 --> 02:02:15.820]   He's America's teenager. There's a guy have you're met him. No have you of course you have?
[02:02:15.820 --> 02:02:22.300]   What do you think I know I worked on a couple of the shows? Oh man that guy was sharp is an amazing guy really really yeah
[02:02:22.300 --> 02:02:24.300]   Very cool. Oh that's neat. I
[02:02:24.300 --> 02:02:28.140]   Work with you know this is well you I know you have the same thing is you know
[02:02:28.140 --> 02:02:33.980]   You work with all these people in the in the 80s to the 90s and then you just seem dying off man
[02:02:33.980 --> 02:02:37.900]   It's like oh Donna summer up. There goes another one. Yeah, you know I feel bad
[02:02:37.900 --> 02:02:43.340]   She passed it was just passed away and I was saying I feel bad because she got branded with the disco tag and
[02:02:43.340 --> 02:02:50.060]   And after disco faded and it faded fast nobody paid any attention or this was a woman with an amazing voice
[02:02:50.060 --> 02:02:56.420]   She would she she could out sing Whitney Houston easily. Yeah, well she she continued to have an outstanding career
[02:02:56.420 --> 02:02:59.460]   Maybe not in mainstream top of the charts, but she
[02:03:00.300 --> 02:03:06.740]   Cosmo on you know almost nightly anywhere she could go anywhere and and put on a show and
[02:03:06.740 --> 02:03:09.820]   It's sweetheart of a woman really
[02:03:09.820 --> 02:03:15.460]   Sweetheart. Yeah, and you know what I understand is that she's actually a victim of 9/11
[02:03:15.460 --> 02:03:22.300]   Indirectly because she was in New York and she believes she got lung cancer from the debris for the dust from
[02:03:22.300 --> 02:03:26.940]   Hours right yeah, she wasn't a smoker no
[02:03:27.900 --> 02:03:29.900]   Yeah, you'll you I guess you'll never know
[02:03:29.900 --> 02:03:37.460]   Well lung cancer is a bitch. I'll tell my mom passed away from that and you know that's this is not a pretty thing
[02:03:37.460 --> 02:03:39.460]   It doesn't end well
[02:03:39.460 --> 02:03:43.500]   And on that happy note, let's thank you all for joining us
[02:03:43.500 --> 02:03:51.260]   Sorry I became a human being for a moment no not allowed. I'm sorry get the sound effects out
[02:03:51.260 --> 02:03:54.260]   The chatroom's talking about this bug that's buggin
[02:03:54.260 --> 02:03:59.260]   You know what's funny about this bug is he's getting right at the right focal length that it looks like he's a giant moth
[02:03:59.260 --> 02:04:00.940]   It's about this big
[02:04:00.940 --> 02:04:03.180]   But he somehow found the exact spot
[02:04:03.180 --> 02:04:07.820]   They're calling it the OCD bug. It's testing the OCD of the people in the chat room
[02:04:07.820 --> 02:04:11.420]   Well, or is it a new kind of drone?
[02:04:11.420 --> 02:04:17.420]   Adam get the dollar the drones now Adam

[02:04:28.300 --> 02:04:34.460]   Adam Curry is at no agenda show calm. That sounds like the big show for you. I'm really glad it's doing well
[02:04:34.460 --> 02:04:39.780]   Well, thank you and you know, obviously, it's it's me and John C. Dvorak
[02:04:39.780 --> 02:04:43.380]   That you know the only thing I'm concerned about is you know
[02:04:43.380 --> 02:04:49.220]   Just keep them both of us alive because that's the we can go on forever with that. It really it really is about the personality's buzz
[02:04:49.220 --> 02:04:51.780]   killing crackpot and there's my shirt by the way, which is
[02:04:52.420 --> 02:04:54.420]   Oh

[02:05:21.940 --> 02:05:23.700]   I'm so flattered
[02:05:23.700 --> 02:05:26.900]   It's good stuff. I mean I don't really watch television
[02:05:26.900 --> 02:05:31.500]   So you're stuck. Yeah, you're stuck. It was between you and C-SPAN. I
[02:05:31.500 --> 02:05:34.060]   Guess we win
[02:05:34.060 --> 02:05:39.380]   It was also nice. I like the guests. I like the Roberts. It's fun to have the Roberts on yeah
[02:05:39.380 --> 02:05:45.180]   Fun man, and we haven't walked around a tower records for years Adam. We're gonna add you to high rotation, okay
[02:05:48.660 --> 02:05:53.260]   Love I love it. Thank you Adam Curry. Thank you Robert scoble the scobleizer actually stick around cuz after the show
[02:05:53.260 --> 02:05:55.820]   We're gonna do a little post show. I want to bring those those
[02:05:55.820 --> 02:05:58.380]   Woven guys up and we could talk a little bit about what they're doing
[02:05:58.380 --> 02:06:00.260]   Robert does such great stuff
[02:06:00.260 --> 02:06:03.060]   you are really the king of discovering new startups and
[02:06:03.060 --> 02:06:10.340]   Cool and interesting stuff and it's the best reason to follow building 43 and the scobleizer wherever you can't actually not
[02:06:10.340 --> 02:06:12.660]   Follow him. He's he's everywhere
[02:06:12.660 --> 02:06:16.860]   But you just tell us quickly what that is I've seen it throughout the whole show. You know what is there?
[02:06:16.860 --> 02:06:24.140]   They're little sensors and they have what 27 of these sensors that do things like study water content and soil or
[02:06:24.140 --> 02:06:27.260]   pressure
[02:06:27.260 --> 02:06:31.020]   RFID
[02:06:31.020 --> 02:06:33.100]   900 megahertz how interesting you know it's funny
[02:06:33.100 --> 02:06:38.780]   You couldn't use stuff on 900 megahertz for a while because everything was on it now everything's got it Wi-Fi and suddenly 900
[02:06:38.780 --> 02:06:42.860]   It's good. It's a good place to be so anyways these little sensors can wake up
[02:06:43.500 --> 02:06:45.980]   Every day and take a soil sample or something like that
[02:06:45.980 --> 02:06:52.620]   And then they'll send the data over to a gateway and then the gateway sends it out to a server a big data server
[02:06:52.620 --> 02:06:56.220]   Summer their slogan is weaving the Internet of things. I think it's kind of interesting
[02:06:56.220 --> 02:06:58.220]   I love this stuff
[02:06:58.220 --> 02:07:01.980]   Raxby loves this stuff because it means more data up on a data server more data is good
[02:07:01.980 --> 02:07:07.460]   Scobleizer.com. That's the that's the home base. I doubt you even post there. Do you know in fact?
[02:07:07.460 --> 02:07:12.900]   I'm working on my blog cuz I'm speaking blog that blog world in New York in the first week of June
[02:07:12.900 --> 02:07:15.820]   Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's it. Yeah
[02:07:15.820 --> 02:07:22.220]   Griculately, I gotta I gotta you know come back so next next time we have something to talk about you know with Adam
[02:07:22.220 --> 02:07:28.220]   Maybe this will be our regular cast. We'll just have you Adam and Robert and we can beat we can do a show like this
[02:07:28.220 --> 02:07:30.220]   Robert Balancer is gonna be so angry
[02:07:30.220 --> 02:07:35.700]   He's always angry that's why he's on the show all the time
[02:07:35.700 --> 02:07:42.220]   At pod rest J. He's in our chatroom is pod rest J all the time. I don't know how you have time to do that
[02:07:42.220 --> 02:07:48.620]   He's gonna be the host of our new IT show which I think we've decided is Friar Tech. I like it at least we'll call him Friar Tech
[02:07:48.620 --> 02:07:52.300]   Thank you so much great to have you it's always fun to be in here
[02:07:52.300 --> 02:07:56.740]   I mean people I mean it people in the chat room are always wondering what it's like to be here
[02:07:56.740 --> 02:08:01.300]   And I'm sure that the guests here right now can tell them this is like a wonderland for geeks
[02:08:01.300 --> 02:08:05.740]   Nice place. Thank you. Yeah, Adam. We'd love to get you next time you're in the Bay Area
[02:08:05.740 --> 02:08:07.740]   We'd love to get you up here and show what we're doing
[02:08:07.740 --> 02:08:13.020]   Yeah, no, I'd also love to see the studio because they followed it when you had the cam hanging up as it was being built
[02:08:13.020 --> 02:08:17.620]   And that's pretty cool. Don tells me it's pretty spectacular. It's a fun place. Yeah, it's a fun place
[02:08:17.620 --> 02:08:24.380]   I'm pretty happy and we couldn't do with that all of you at home watching. We really appreciate our next board meeting
[02:08:24.380 --> 02:08:27.980]   I'll see if I can have him plan it conveniently. You can have it here
[02:08:27.980 --> 02:08:30.940]   Yeah, you don't want that
[02:08:30.940 --> 02:08:33.580]   Let's broadcast it
[02:08:36.940 --> 02:08:39.740]   That would be actually an interesting show board meetings
[02:08:39.740 --> 02:08:42.900]   They've never let it happen, but it was fascinating
[02:08:42.900 --> 02:08:47.500]   Just to know what's going maybe would you do is tape them and then ten years after everybody's dead you show them
[02:08:47.500 --> 02:08:50.900]   Well, you know you have the word meetings of the dead
[02:08:50.900 --> 02:08:55.740]   I've listened to a lot of those financial conference calls of public public listed companies. Yeah
[02:08:55.740 --> 02:08:58.180]   Like the JP Morgan
[02:08:58.180 --> 02:09:05.020]   It's a two billion dollar loss. Yeah. Yeah, it was a girl. The conference call was spectacular. That must have been interesting. Yeah
[02:09:05.580 --> 02:09:12.420]   And they're they're public you can pretty much you get the information dial into them. It's it's a good past
[02:09:12.420 --> 02:09:16.220]   That would be a good one to listen a good thing is that they invested in Facebook. So they'll be good
[02:09:16.220 --> 02:09:21.660]   They actually made a lot of money. They're gonna be fine. Don't worry. They made back all their losses
[02:09:21.660 --> 02:09:23.100]   Thank you for joining us
[02:09:23.100 --> 02:09:28.780]   I'm serious when I say we couldn't do without you and make sure you tune in whenever you can we'd love to do the show live

[02:09:55.660 --> 02:10:00.340]   We thought we could take their time slot people seem to like it in the earlier in the day. So

[02:10:30.860 --> 02:10:35.940]   He basically thinks it's a dumb show. I'm I am a sucker for some some
[02:10:35.940 --> 02:10:41.220]   Dancing and seeing me - if people burst in a song I'm happy
[02:10:41.220 --> 02:10:47.820]   If I could figure out a way to have this show burst into song every ten minutes. I would give me five minutes
[02:10:47.820 --> 02:10:49.020]   Not with me on it
[02:10:49.020 --> 02:10:54.340]   No, if you wanted to do a show like that have the sea of Dropbox and Randy Zuckerberg
[02:10:54.340 --> 02:10:58.740]   Oh, they're actually they're pretty bad and I always wanted to
[02:10:59.500 --> 02:11:02.180]   Give my speech as a rap performance
[02:11:02.180 --> 02:11:05.340]   So I wanted to start you know when I give public do public speaking
[02:11:05.340 --> 02:11:08.380]   I want to start like an a normal in a suit say but wait a minute
[02:11:08.380 --> 02:11:15.820]   Let me explain and then have smoke bomb smoke pots and and and have a background singers and
[02:11:15.820 --> 02:11:21.300]   Terraway suit that I just always wanted to do that someday. I'm gonna do that Chad. Did you get all that?
[02:11:21.300 --> 02:11:24.300]   You gotta you just gotta get your your your rap together man like but
[02:11:24.300 --> 02:11:32.600]   And my name is Leo I'm at large. I'm in the foxy ladies and I drive fast cause I'm going down and history as the
[02:11:32.600 --> 02:11:38.720]   Whitest to rapper that ever will be down from the highs and you feel in the lows and the beat starts tapping into your toes
[02:11:38.720 --> 02:11:43.940]   I got a degree in rapology. I got a PhD in rhyme and I could go on forever
[02:11:43.940 --> 02:11:49.580]   That's awesome well done
[02:11:49.580 --> 02:11:51.320]   >> That was the best thing in the show.
