[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.280]   It's time for TWIT this weekend tech.
[00:02:19.280 --> 00:02:23.920]   We've got a great show for you, but before we do that, I want to take a look at a little
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:29.520]   video YouTube put out, "The Best of 2014."
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:30.840]   They call it YouTube Rewind.
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:34.360]   I think this is the fourth or fifth they've done.
[00:02:34.360 --> 00:02:44.120]   And it features a great number of YouTube celebrities, including DJ Earworm's fabulous
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.720]   mix and Cutie Pie.
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:50.720]   We jump through the ceiling.
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:53.120]   I'm curious.
[00:02:53.120 --> 00:02:55.520]   A crazy, crazy thing.
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:03:02.040]   I'm going to jump ahead though, because if we go all the way into the mountains, we're
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:06.320]   going to see, "Hey, I know, wait a minute.
[00:03:06.320 --> 00:03:08.400]   I know that person.
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:13.120]   There's I Justine in the mountains blowing glitter dust."
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:18.120]   This is actually an amazing video.
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:19.520]   Justine is on the line with us.
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:20.520]   Justine is Eric.
[00:03:20.520 --> 00:03:21.520]   Hi, how you doing?
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:22.520]   Hello, how are you?
[00:03:22.520 --> 00:03:26.560]   I just wanted to talk a little bit about this before we got into the news portion of
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:27.560]   the show.
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.720]   I was so blown away by this.
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:31.680]   Every year, they do such a good job.
[00:03:31.680 --> 00:03:35.680]   And this year, they actually have, like, I think 120, over 120 creators in this video.
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.600]   They went all around the world to get creators, not only just from the US, but they tried
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:40.880]   to incorporate as many as they could.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:41.880]   And it's awesome.
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:46.520]   And they used the YouTube spaces in New York, LA, London, and Tokyo.
[00:03:46.520 --> 00:03:47.520]   Yeah.
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.240]   So there, in fact, I think there's eight locations on this, five shooting days.
[00:03:51.240 --> 00:03:53.840]   Did they ever tell you how much they spent on this?
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:58.320]   They didn't, but knowing how much production costs definitely was a pretty million.
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:00.400]   This is millions of dollars in this.
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:04.320]   Yeah, and the crazy thing is, is all of these YouTube people, I mean, a lot of them are
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:06.080]   my friends too, and I know how busy they are.
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:10.600]   So for them to be able to get all of these people in one video is amazing.
[00:04:10.600 --> 00:04:11.600]   It's so impressive.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:17.640]   This, where you're blowing the dust, the fairy dust, looks like it's in the mountains, in
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:19.120]   the Swiss Alps or something.
[00:04:19.120 --> 00:04:25.040]   But I'm guessing they didn't fly all of you to the Swiss Alps to do this frozen thing.
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:26.040]   Nope.
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:28.120]   We were in a parking lot downtown Los Angeles.
[00:04:28.120 --> 00:04:29.800]   It was like 100 degrees.
[00:04:29.800 --> 00:04:31.800]   Everybody is sweating and loving.
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:33.360]   No, it was hot.
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.360]   It was so hot.
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:35.360]   Everyone was dying.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.760]   Oh my goodness.
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:41.600]   They made you wear a knit hat, a sweater, a scarf, and it's 100 degrees out.
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:44.320]   Yeah, but I mean, it ended up turning out really awesome.
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:48.040]   It's just crazy because like we spent almost half a day, and I know even previously, like
[00:04:48.040 --> 00:04:51.200]   the people who spent like days on these, and then you have like a two second cameo.
[00:04:51.200 --> 00:04:52.200]   Yeah.
[00:04:52.200 --> 00:04:54.160]   But that's, I mean, you guys know how production works.
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:55.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:04:55.160 --> 00:04:56.160]   It's a whole hurry.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.640]   But everybody's, Conan O'Brien's in this, John Oliver's in this.
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:00.640]   Yeah.
[00:05:00.640 --> 00:05:03.040]   Why does YouTube do these rewinds?
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:04.640]   It's a good question.
[00:05:04.640 --> 00:05:10.480]   I mean, I think they really like to kind of show the community in YouTube.
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:14.400]   And this is such a good way to kind of pull all of the trends together from the past year.
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.920]   And it's just a really fun video.
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:19.840]   So I think it really shows that they're willing to invest in creators and they're doing a
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:21.960]   much better job of that in the past couple of years.
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:22.960]   So it's great.
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:25.440]   Although last year was my favorite because it was what does the Fox say.
[00:05:25.440 --> 00:05:26.440]   Right.
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.440]   So.
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:28.440]   Were you in that one too?
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:29.440]   I was.
[00:05:29.440 --> 00:05:30.440]   Yeah, I forget what I was doing.
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:34.840]   Just the guy who does the invisible drive-through pranks.
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:40.800]   47 million views in the first week for this year's YouTube rewind.
[00:05:40.800 --> 00:05:43.960]   So it's clearly something that people are interested in.
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:44.960]   I think part of the-
[00:05:44.960 --> 00:05:47.000]   And what I think part with the hamster is my favorite.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.680]   He's eating a little YouTube chicklet.
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:50.680]   So cute.
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:51.680]   Have you seen those videos?
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:55.320]   It's like this whole series where this hamster eats tiny little miniature food.
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:57.560]   And it is the cutest thing ever.
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:05:59.880]   I think that's also part of the value of this.
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:01.800]   And you see everybody's getting credit here.
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:05.840]   Part of the value of this is introducing some of these YouTube stars to a larger audience.
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:10.280]   I had to actually sit down with a 12 year old and to find out who all these people are.
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:12.760]   And he knew he knew at least half of them.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:17.760]   Yeah, I think I only knew half of them, which is so crazy because this community is so massive
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.560]   that even a lot of these YouTubers are the countries.
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:21.160]   I'm like, I, where did you come from?
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.640]   You have millions of subscribers.
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:24.160]   And I'm just now finding out about you.
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:28.520]   So it is a really cool way to kind of get caught up on all the cool stuff that's happening
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:29.520]   on YouTube.
[00:06:29.520 --> 00:06:35.400]   Also, I think establishes YouTube as more than just the viral video site or the crotch
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:40.840]   shot video site that these are all these are all creators who are making content on a regular
[00:06:40.840 --> 00:06:41.840]   basis.
[00:06:41.840 --> 00:06:46.280]   They have a style, they have a voice, they have a name and they're very successful as
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:48.080]   a result.
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:51.760]   Although then the normal person like John C. DeVorac, you'd look at this and you go,
[00:06:51.760 --> 00:06:53.760]   I don't know who these I love this guy.
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:54.760]   I know all of them.
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:55.760]   You know that guy?
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:56.760]   Yeah.
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:57.760]   Yeah.
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:06:58.760]   Really you look at them and you I know them.
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:59.760]   I've seen them before.
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:04.080]   And I think what you overlook is these guys are making money.
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:06.440]   Are they making money?
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:07.760]   Justine, how lucrative is YouTube?
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:09.000]   I mean, almost everybody like me.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.520]   She'll fun has to sell cosmetic kits and stuff.
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:13.120]   I mean, she makes her money in other ways.
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:14.120]   Yeah.
[00:07:14.120 --> 00:07:17.720]   I mean, it is hard because I mean, in YouTube, they do have sort of the partner program.
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.920]   And I mean, you'll get a percentage of your ad revenue, but sometimes ad revenue isn't
[00:07:20.920 --> 00:07:21.920]   always the best.
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:22.920]   So a lot of us do sponsored videos.
[00:07:22.920 --> 00:07:23.920]   We do other projects.
[00:07:23.920 --> 00:07:24.920]   Right.
[00:07:24.920 --> 00:07:29.640]   And so it really is trying to find creative ways to have sort of that other revenue stream.
[00:07:29.640 --> 00:07:31.280]   But it is so much fun.
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:35.280]   And I love taking sponsored projects where it allows me to create bigger and better projects
[00:07:35.280 --> 00:07:38.560]   that I normally wouldn't be able to do without the help of sponsors.
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:39.560]   Right.
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.880]   And I mean, you guys know this is what we do.
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:41.880]   So it's great.
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:42.880]   Right.
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:48.560]   Well, and I think also if you see YouTube as a launching point and not an end point, but
[00:07:48.560 --> 00:07:52.360]   as part of a larger thing, then it makes more sense than if you're saying, I'm trying
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:54.440]   to make a living off of what I do on YouTube.
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.440]   It is.
[00:07:55.440 --> 00:07:56.440]   And it takes a lot of time.
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:57.440]   I mean, I've been doing this forever.
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.440]   And I think one of the videos that you make.
[00:08:00.440 --> 00:08:02.400]   I at least post one piece of content a day.
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:05.080]   I used to I've been posting like daily gaming videos.
[00:08:05.080 --> 00:08:09.240]   And right now in December, they do this thing called vlogmas, which you vlog every day until
[00:08:09.240 --> 00:08:10.240]   Christmas.
[00:08:10.240 --> 00:08:11.960]   So you put out a video every day until then.
[00:08:11.960 --> 00:08:16.000]   But it takes a lot of time, especially most of the YouTubers, they still do shoot and
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.800]   edit all of their own stuff.
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:19.720]   So it's very time consuming.
[00:08:19.720 --> 00:08:27.000]   A lot of these are shut YouTube spaces like the LA space where our former producer, Eileen,
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   is one of the producers there.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   How important are the?
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   Yeah, we love Eileen.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.440]   How important Eileen River, how important are these YouTube spaces to creators?
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:41.520]   I think it's important because it does allow YouTube to be able to have a place where you
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:44.800]   can do meetings, you can have events, you can do premieres.
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:49.080]   And it kind of more or less validates it in the traditional space because most of the
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:52.280]   YouTubers, we shoot at home, we shoot wherever.
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:56.800]   So I wish they had this five or six years ago before I invested my entire life into
[00:08:56.800 --> 00:08:58.760]   buying equipment and computers.
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:03.440]   But it does definitely validate it where it's these places all around the world that
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:04.440]   you're able to go.
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:07.680]   So no matter what city I'm in, if there's a YouTube space, you could just come in and
[00:09:07.680 --> 00:09:08.680]   shoot.
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:11.200]   So you get a sense of community and being a part of a larger community when you go to
[00:09:11.200 --> 00:09:13.120]   those YouTube spaces?
[00:09:13.120 --> 00:09:14.120]   For sure.
[00:09:14.120 --> 00:09:17.760]   And I think it's really important in LA too, because to be able to rent out those studio
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:21.760]   spaces and they mean they have full production suites and they have all kinds of stuff.
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:26.000]   You do have to go through a training program before you're able to actually use it.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:30.480]   So there is that, but it's just a great place that if YouTube wants to film something,
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:33.560]   I mean they have it all right there at their disposal.
[00:09:33.560 --> 00:09:37.160]   I tell you, when you look at something like this, you realize what a phenomenon YouTube
[00:09:37.160 --> 00:09:38.160]   has become.
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:39.160]   It is.
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:43.160]   And the number one most viewed thing is gaming, which they kind of, they did screw up because
[00:09:43.160 --> 00:09:44.880]   they didn't put enough actual games.
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:46.360]   They missed out on Twitch.
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:51.040]   Yeah, but I mean, that's kind of a little competitor.
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:52.040]   Now it is.
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:53.040]   They could have bought it.
[00:09:53.040 --> 00:09:54.040]   They could have.
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:55.040]   They definitely could have.
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.920]   They should have bought it.
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:09:58.480]   I mean, I'm not pointing fingers.
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:00.720]   Justine, I'll let you go.
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:02.080]   I thank you so much for being here.
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:05.960]   I just, when I saw this and I saw you and I said, "Hey, we got to get Justine on and
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:09.440]   just talk a little bit about this."
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:12.480]   When you look at it, you realize, boy, they really put a lot of work into it.
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:13.480]   And what a great job.
[00:10:13.480 --> 00:10:15.280]   We'll have a good rest of your show and happy holidays.
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:16.280]   Happy holidays.
[00:10:16.280 --> 00:10:17.280]   Good to see you again.
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:18.280]   You too.
[00:10:18.280 --> 00:10:19.280]   Keep up the good work.
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.280]   YouTube.com/Justine.
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.280]   I justine.
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:22.280]   I justine.
[00:10:22.280 --> 00:10:23.280]   Yes.
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.280]   YouTube.com/IJustine.
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:26.520]   That's one of like 80 channels.
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:27.520]   I know.
[00:10:27.520 --> 00:10:28.520]   That's two of two months.
[00:10:28.520 --> 00:10:29.520]   She's a very busy person.
[00:10:29.520 --> 00:10:30.520]   Thank Justine.
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:31.520]   Bye.
[00:10:31.520 --> 00:10:32.520]   Take care.
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:33.520]   Bye-bye.
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.000]   Now let me introduce the rest of the panel.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:36.240]   Grumpy old John C. Devorak is here.
[00:10:36.240 --> 00:10:37.240]   I want you.
[00:10:37.240 --> 00:10:38.880]   I'm only grumpy because you took I Justine off the air.
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:39.880]   I know.
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:40.880]   I love her.
[00:10:40.880 --> 00:10:41.880]   Isn't she talented?
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:42.880]   Wonderful.
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:43.880]   You know, we discovered her.
[00:10:43.880 --> 00:10:45.440]   Actually, Alex Lindsey discovered her.
[00:10:45.440 --> 00:10:46.800]   I mean, she probably doesn't think that.
[00:10:46.800 --> 00:10:50.760]   She thinks she was known before we discovered her.
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:56.640]   But she was at a word camp, you know, a word press camp in Pittsburgh.
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:59.360]   And Alex Lindsey met her and said, "You're going to be a star.
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:01.040]   We had her on a Mac break all the time."
[00:11:01.040 --> 00:11:02.040]   This is true.
[00:11:02.040 --> 00:11:05.000]   And then she went on to bigger and better things.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.200]   I thought that she predated Mac break.
[00:11:07.200 --> 00:11:08.280]   You'd think that, wouldn't you?
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:09.480]   I'm pretty sure of it.
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:11.680]   Well, I'm sure she was born before that.
[00:11:11.680 --> 00:11:13.080]   That's John C. Devorak.
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:16.280]   NoahGenashow.com, channel.devorak.org.
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:17.280]   It's good to have you back.
[00:11:17.280 --> 00:11:18.680]   You didn't bring my camera back.
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:22.240]   You know, I brought it back last time I was here and then I was going to bring it back
[00:11:22.240 --> 00:11:23.440]   and I left it at the house.
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:24.440]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:25.440]   I heard it all before.
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:26.600]   Also, Christina Warren is here.
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:30.120]   Great to have film grow with us for Matchable.
[00:11:30.120 --> 00:11:34.960]   It's obviously freezing where you are because you're indoors and you're wearing a wool hat.
[00:11:34.960 --> 00:11:38.160]   I am because it's cold and my heat is not really working correctly.
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.160]   I got to get the landlord out.
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:44.600]   Oh, yeah, this is one of those things where I'm going to sweater and hats.
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.760]   If I had my wits about me, probably a scarf.
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:52.080]   If you get chilly or your throat starts to get a little scratchy, please go get that
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:53.680]   scarf and then maybe a hot cup of tea.
[00:11:53.680 --> 00:11:54.680]   I will.
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:56.360]   I won't want you to get sick on us.
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:01.680]   Dwight Silverman is also here from his offices in Houston where it is a balmy, what, 80 degrees?
[00:12:01.680 --> 00:12:03.960]   It's in about the 70s here.
[00:12:03.960 --> 00:12:08.760]   It's a typical Houston winter so far.
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:15.000]   It is at the Houston Chronicle blog.cron.com/techblog and it's always great to have you on as well.
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   Thank you, Matt.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   Leo, I'm excited.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   I love Christina.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.400]   I'm a big fan of hers.
[00:12:20.400 --> 00:12:25.240]   I was particularly enamored of the piece she did about the Sony Pictures blowing the Steve
[00:12:25.240 --> 00:12:28.480]   Jobs film and I can't wait to hear her talk about it today.
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:34.280]   Let's talk about it right now because it is the story of the century.
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:36.800]   Sony Pictures Entertainment hack, of course.
[00:12:36.800 --> 00:12:38.720]   No one knows who did it.
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:44.560]   Even though apparently there was some Korean in the virus code, the thought that North
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:48.360]   Korea did it as revenge for the interview movie seems to me on the face of it.
[00:12:48.360 --> 00:12:49.360]   That's not true.
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:57.160]   It's not very credible, especially since these hashtag GOP people are some kind of independent.
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:00.920]   So we'll put it that way on their own.
[00:13:00.920 --> 00:13:01.920]   I'm wondering.
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:05.160]   I think it's interesting to try to figure out who did it but I know that they said
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:10.960]   out a Christmas gift for everyone.
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.760]   Well, apparently they came out today.
[00:13:12.760 --> 00:13:17.720]   They got into Sony so good that they got everything on every computer, every server,
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:23.440]   all the content of the emails, the deals, the contracts, everything.
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:26.920]   It's all been revealed, even movies on their server.
[00:13:26.920 --> 00:13:30.400]   And Christina has been one of the people who has been watching this really closely.
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:34.760]   And in fact, going through some of these materials, looking for stuff, how much stuff
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:37.400]   is there, Christina, so far?
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:43.800]   So far, I guess about 250 gigabytes, I would say, has been released so far.
[00:13:43.800 --> 00:13:44.800]   And you think there's more?
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:46.720]   And yeah, there's definitely more.
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:49.040]   I mean, and they're releasing it pretty indiscriminately.
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.760]   They released some information today.
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:52.760]   They said the Christmas gift for everyone.
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:55.680]   I haven't had a chance to download that torrent yet and see what's in it.
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:13:59.240]   But, you know, I mean, basically for the last two weeks, they've been releasing stuff
[00:13:59.240 --> 00:14:01.840]   about every day, every other day or so.
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:03.080]   And it's been pretty indiscriminate.
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:07.840]   You know, it started with some of the leaked films and that got a lot of attention.
[00:14:07.840 --> 00:14:09.080]   Those were basically just screen or copy.
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:10.320]   So they weren't even that great.
[00:14:10.320 --> 00:14:12.120]   But that got a lot of attention.
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:17.240]   And then what we saw with the first dump of documents was, you know, oh, wow, this is
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.880]   actually some really serious internal stuff.
[00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:27.400]   And then they've escalated going from, you know, documents to deals to inboxes and then
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:31.720]   the emails they've released so far have been, you know, the A-Pascal, the co-chairman of
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:38.440]   Sony Pictures, as well as someone in one of the heads of legal councils inbox.
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:42.440]   And you know, just hundreds of gigs of documents, I mean, literally, you know, thousands upon
[00:14:42.440 --> 00:14:47.840]   thousands of documents, you know, mostly Excel files, document files, some PDFs.
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:49.760]   And I mean, there's just so much.
[00:14:49.760 --> 00:14:51.960]   It's hard to really wrap your mind around.
[00:14:51.960 --> 00:14:54.680]   And then, I mean, what's bad is the audience so deeply.
[00:14:54.680 --> 00:14:59.680]   I mean, they literally had lists of every single server, every single workstation, every single,
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:04.160]   you know, virtual machine, everything on the premises, all of those devices, including
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:08.200]   their serial numbers, including their MAC addresses, you know, were all listed.
[00:15:08.200 --> 00:15:12.040]   They had lists of every account that had pseudo access, you know, I mean, they had password
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:13.040]   files galore.
[00:15:13.040 --> 00:15:17.880]   I mean, they got, they got in hard and, you know, trying to sort through the material
[00:15:17.880 --> 00:15:20.640]   and figure out what's there has been a real challenge.
[00:15:20.640 --> 00:15:24.880]   And so a lot of us in the media are kind of going through it and the emails certainly
[00:15:24.880 --> 00:15:28.560]   had some of the most enlightening stuff, at least, you know, for the public there.
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:30.160]   But there's all kinds of other stuff too.
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:33.560]   I mean, I've been talking to some former and current Sony employees.
[00:15:33.560 --> 00:15:38.040]   There's a secret Facebook group of about 3,500 people right now who are all freaked
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.800]   out because there's social security numbers.
[00:15:39.800 --> 00:15:41.320]   I've been part of this.
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:45.920]   And you know, people are worried about having their identity stolen and what records are
[00:15:45.920 --> 00:15:47.160]   they going to have and that.
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:53.240]   So I mean, there's so much that it's kind of difficult to put into context because this
[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:56.520]   is, I mean, this is the worst corporate hack ever.
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:59.320]   And I mean, it kind of, you know, it's kind of like, you know, the WikiLeaks, kind of
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:03.360]   like the cable gate sort of thing, but for a corporation.
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:07.560]   You know who I take a look at to see maybe the bad actor?
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:12.160]   Look for all the companies that made proposals to Sony about improving their security.
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:14.320]   That seems like the first.
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:15.320]   And was ignored.
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:16.320]   Yeah, it was ignored.
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.680]   In other words, you know, David Boyes is out there.
[00:16:18.680 --> 00:16:23.240]   You know, that famous guy was the attorney against Microsoft and all these other things.
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:25.840]   He's the so he's taken over the Sony Council.
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:26.840]   Yeah.
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:31.000]   And he's threatening everybody saying, this is stolen material.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   You can't be reprinted.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:37.040]   Well, in fact, didn't the FBI arrest one person for downloading some of this material?
[00:16:37.040 --> 00:16:38.040]   Am I wrong?
[00:16:38.040 --> 00:16:39.040]   It's not.
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.240]   No, I saw that they saw something with that.
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:45.440]   I mean, it's Sony's been de-adawcing the sites that host this material.
[00:16:45.440 --> 00:16:47.320]   Let me explain how this legal.
[00:16:47.320 --> 00:16:48.320]   Yeah.
[00:16:48.320 --> 00:16:50.840]   Well, but they're doing it out of a server is an Asia.
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:51.840]   So it's OK.
[00:16:51.840 --> 00:16:52.840]   Yeah, sure.
[00:16:52.840 --> 00:16:55.040]   How are they distributing this data?
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:57.840]   Is it a torrent link that they post to paste bin?
[00:16:57.840 --> 00:16:59.480]   Is that what they're doing?
[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:00.920]   Basically, basically.
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:04.120]   And they're also, you know, they're using various file hosts and they're getting down.
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:05.360]   They're getting taken down really quickly.
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:09.960]   You know, the paste bins are going down, you know, within, you know, hours, sometimes
[00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:10.960]   less than that.
[00:17:10.960 --> 00:17:12.840]   And so the press is jumping on these links.
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:16.200]   The minute they're published, publicize and downloading as fast as they can.
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.000]   Well, right.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.640]   And then they're also emailing us.
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:23.240]   So the hackers are emailing you directly?
[00:17:23.240 --> 00:17:24.800]   Yes.
[00:17:24.800 --> 00:17:26.600]   What are they saying those emails?
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:30.760]   Just that has a link to the paste bin and some of their, you know, half-English sort
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:31.760]   of stuff that.
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:35.000]   So before they make it public, they send it to you so that you can get it.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   No, no, no, no.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:38.840]   They're actually, they've been a little bit late, actually.
[00:17:38.840 --> 00:17:42.240]   It's funny because I think I was one of the first people to get the emails and that was
[00:17:42.240 --> 00:17:43.240]   purely happenstance.
[00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:46.840]   I happened, it was on Monday, I just happened to go to paste bin and search.
[00:17:46.840 --> 00:17:50.560]   And I found the emails, they've been up for about 11 minutes.
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:54.320]   And we didn't get any sort of link from them, you know, for another three or four hours.
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:59.760]   What do you say to people who say it is as bad to look at this material as it is to look
[00:17:59.760 --> 00:18:02.920]   at the naked pictures of Jennifer Lawrence?
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:05.120]   It says unethical to do that.
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:06.120]   You're really.
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:07.120]   Really?
[00:18:07.120 --> 00:18:08.120]   By looking at this material.
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:09.120]   Uh-huh.
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:10.120]   Yeah, sure.
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:13.120]   I mean, it's not even remotely the same thing.
[00:18:13.120 --> 00:18:16.480]   I mean, I understand why people have that.
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.400]   I understand why people can draw that conclusion.
[00:18:18.400 --> 00:18:22.600]   But first of all, I think it's a false equivalency to equate public, or not public, but corporate
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:28.120]   documents for public companies from private communications that are taking place on the
[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:29.120]   material.
[00:18:29.120 --> 00:18:30.280]   But it is stolen material.
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:31.880]   Of course it is, but sort of the Pentagon Papers.
[00:18:31.880 --> 00:18:33.680]   So is the NSA leaks the most thing that we look for.
[00:18:33.680 --> 00:18:37.840]   Yeah, but wait a minute, you can't say that what this has anywhere near the end or the
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:38.840]   Pentagon.
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:39.840]   I'm not.
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:40.840]   I'm not in any way at all.
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:41.840]   I'm not.
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:42.840]   I'm in no way trying to equate the two.
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:43.840]   Let me be very clear.
[00:18:43.840 --> 00:18:44.840]   There's no equation.
[00:18:44.840 --> 00:18:45.840]   What is the public?
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:46.840]   What do I have to know?
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:48.560]   This stuff from Sony then.
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:54.600]   There's no public need to know what James Franco got for being in the interview.
[00:18:54.600 --> 00:18:55.600]   That's got.
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:19:00.400]   Well, I mean, I mean, it is got the, but it's also, I mean, but it's the sort of information
[00:19:00.400 --> 00:19:06.760]   that if we're, if we're being completely honest, if someone were to email us the budget from
[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:11.600]   that film and it were to come into my inbox and it weren't to be part of this thing.
[00:19:11.600 --> 00:19:13.040]   It would be stolen and it would still be news.
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:16.080]   No, it's still be something that the trade publications would publish.
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:18.920]   And most of the time, I mean, this is kind of the, you know, the uncomfortable part about
[00:19:18.920 --> 00:19:23.480]   journalism Andrew Wallenstein at Variety wrote a really good op-ed that I largely agree
[00:19:23.480 --> 00:19:27.760]   with that kind of says, you know, we get stolen material all the time.
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:28.960]   That's kind of part of our job.
[00:19:28.960 --> 00:19:33.240]   People leak things to us usually for their purposes, usually with their own agendas.
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:34.480]   And we have to go through it aside.
[00:19:34.480 --> 00:19:35.840]   What's worthy and what's not.
[00:19:35.840 --> 00:19:40.200]   And in a case like this, you know, there are foil requests and obviously this is stolen,
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:44.240]   but a lot of times there are foil requests for information that was obtained illegally
[00:19:44.240 --> 00:19:49.200]   that the people go through and search for the most salacious or the most interesting tidbits.
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:52.240]   Now, you know, you can make the argument that something like, you know, the Inside Story,
[00:19:52.240 --> 00:19:56.320]   the Steve Jobs movie is it's all, it might not be news.
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.320]   I would disagree.
[00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:58.320]   I think that it is news.
[00:19:58.320 --> 00:19:59.320]   I think it's interesting.
[00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:03.240]   I think that seeing the inner workings of how a major studio bungles a high profile project
[00:20:03.240 --> 00:20:06.840]   is news, whether it's the most newsworthy thing out there, of course not.
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:07.840]   But it is news.
[00:20:07.840 --> 00:20:12.800]   I also think that things such as salaries, things such as, you know, internal memos and
[00:20:12.800 --> 00:20:18.400]   finding out, you know, information about things that might be going against what's being said
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:21.840]   publicly are interesting.
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:24.800]   And then, you know, you also have to kind of look through and figure out are there things
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:28.080]   that are happening that might be bad.
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:32.760]   You know, some people have been looking into the potential pay gap within Sony for, you
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:33.760]   know, across gender lines.
[00:20:33.760 --> 00:20:37.960]   I haven't actually seen any proof that that exists in a conventional sense.
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:42.040]   But I mean, you know, these are the things that are worth kind of looking into to find
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.040]   out.
[00:20:43.040 --> 00:20:48.200]   I mean, I've been getting from some sources that there was a lot of the layoffs that Sony
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:52.120]   made might have actually been tied to what employees were costing them the most in terms
[00:20:52.120 --> 00:20:54.760]   of their health insurance and their health insurance program.
[00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:57.160]   That's something that we're looking into and trying to verify.
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:59.040]   You know, these are real stories.
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:03.960]   And when you get this data, you know, you go through it, our job as journalists is to
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:09.160]   be responsible to the truth first and foremost, not to the individuals at Sony.
[00:21:09.160 --> 00:21:13.000]   And then the second responsibility, I mean, you know, and I put, you know, when I wrote
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:16.680]   my story, you know, the six thousand words, I reached out to every person that was in
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:17.840]   it in advance.
[00:21:17.840 --> 00:21:21.040]   It's not as if they didn't get a heads up and they didn't know that it was coming.
[00:21:21.040 --> 00:21:24.440]   Second of all, you know, there are things that you omit because when you're going through
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:28.680]   this stuff, I had certain lines where I said, you know, if this is going to be communication
[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:33.440]   between someone and their husband or wife and it's going to be clearly personal in nature,
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:37.000]   it's not necessary to be part of this narrative.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.120]   It's not necessary to be part of this story.
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:41.200]   So I understand the criticism.
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:45.440]   Well, even Andrew Wallerstein, I'm not saying that it doesn't feel gross.
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:50.080]   Yeah, even Andrew Wallerstein, who was the co-editor in chief of Variety, says at the
[00:21:50.080 --> 00:21:57.000]   end of his op ed piece, every reporter is fantasized about stumbling upon a treasure
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   trove of secret documents.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:03.920]   So when a story such as Sony is spread in front of us all in its unprecedented scope, it's
[00:22:03.920 --> 00:22:05.240]   instinctive for us to pounce.
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:11.080]   But this time around acting on that reflex just doesn't feel right, even though it isn't
[00:22:11.080 --> 00:22:12.080]   wrong.
[00:22:12.080 --> 00:22:13.080]   He's conflicted.
[00:22:13.080 --> 00:22:14.080]   Right.
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.080]   I mean, exactly.
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:16.080]   Well, no, and I am.
[00:22:16.080 --> 00:22:17.080]   I am too.
[00:22:17.080 --> 00:22:19.520]   It's not an easy thing to do.
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:25.040]   I mean, you know what I found interesting about your article, you know, you feel uncomfortable,
[00:22:25.040 --> 00:22:27.400]   but that's kind of one of the challenges.
[00:22:27.400 --> 00:22:31.560]   One of the things I found interesting about your article is how much of what you report
[00:22:31.560 --> 00:22:36.880]   from the inside sources was already leaked by sites like Deadline.
[00:22:36.880 --> 00:22:40.280]   It seems like Hollywood is a pretty leaky sieve anyway.
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:41.840]   Well, that's a.
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:46.360]   And they nailed it, by the way, in every case, Deadline and these other gossip columns got
[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:47.360]   it exactly right.
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:48.360]   Well, we.
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:50.000]   Well, and I, and it was funny.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.280]   I, you know, my story was, was so long as it was, I wasn't able to make it into its own
[00:22:54.280 --> 00:22:55.280]   kind of narrative.
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:59.400]   But one of the things that, that I, I wanted to kind of even say was that it was funny.
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.640]   You could look at the date that emails were happening.
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:06.520]   You could look at the timestamp and literally within hours, the story, sometimes within
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:09.440]   45 minutes, there would be a story on Deadline or the Hollywood Reporter.
[00:23:09.440 --> 00:23:11.880]   There was clearly leaks happening from within the inside.
[00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:13.360]   And this happens all the time.
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:16.920]   So this is another reason why I'm saying in this case, I would never equate it to looking
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:20.720]   at nude photos of celebrities because a lot of the information is being leaked willingly
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:24.040]   by the party anyway for their own benefit for, you know, trying to influence things
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:25.040]   one way or another.
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:29.320]   I'm not saying that it can't be painful and that it can't be embarrassing and that this
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:32.720]   isn't devastating for the people who are involved.
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:36.800]   But this is also kind of part of the game with Hollywood where things are leaked and
[00:23:36.800 --> 00:23:40.240]   that's kind of the case with business journalism too, where we leak things.
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:41.240]   That's kind of what we do.
[00:23:41.240 --> 00:23:44.880]   That's kind of, you know, part of our role in the press is we get information, we vet
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:46.640]   it and we publish it.
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:51.200]   And the fact that this information was obtained illegally while awful that this, you know,
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:57.920]   illegal act happened does not mean that it's unethical according to, you know, the journalistic
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:24:00.360]   guidelines or anything else for us to go through them.
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:05.200]   In fact, on the contrary, that the amount of legal precedent involved in saying that obtaining,
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:10.800]   you know, stuff from publishing stuff from stolen documents is absolutely legal and,
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:16.160]   you know, absolutely ethical according to, you know, almost every single, you know, journalistic
[00:24:16.160 --> 00:24:17.400]   guideline out there.
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:18.400]   Really?
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.600]   That doesn't mean that people can't be great.
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:20.600]   Yeah.
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:22.200]   That doesn't mean people can't be grossed out about it.
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:25.240]   And that can't mean that reporters can't feel comfortable with it.
[00:24:25.240 --> 00:24:28.280]   You know, I'm not absolutely sure that's correct, but that I think there's something
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:29.800]   we're overlooking here.
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:32.400]   First of all, this stuff is so banal.
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:33.400]   Who cares?
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:39.240]   Who cares whether James Franco got a free ride in a limo or any of these things are so
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:45.600]   mundane and I, there's some journalistically important stuff in here, cases of sexual
[00:24:45.600 --> 00:24:47.480]   harassment that were buried by Sony.
[00:24:47.480 --> 00:24:48.640]   Well, that's okay.
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:51.920]   That's kind of interesting and I think that should be taken up with the legal operation
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:56.040]   or the people who were affected by it.
[00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:59.360]   But it seems to me that this is not that interesting.
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:01.040]   Well, I beg to differ.
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:03.680]   How many hits did you get on your article, Christina?
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:05.680]   I mean, we've had a lot.
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:06.840]   I mean, I think this is interesting.
[00:25:06.840 --> 00:25:07.840]   Well, no, I'm not saying what--
[00:25:07.840 --> 00:25:12.040]   Well, any gossip stuff will be that way, but still it's banal.
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:13.040]   I mean, it's--
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:14.040]   Oh, it doesn't mean that it's--
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:15.440]   It's like, well, it's like a traffic wreck.
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:17.040]   Oh, let's stop and check it out.
[00:25:17.040 --> 00:25:18.040]   Right.
[00:25:18.040 --> 00:25:23.400]   This whole thing seems to be-- what I think people should be more focused on is the outrageous
[00:25:23.400 --> 00:25:27.360]   amount of stuff that is on their servers that shouldn't be on their servers.
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:28.360]   Unprotected.
[00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:29.360]   Yeah.
[00:25:29.360 --> 00:25:32.560]   It was ridiculous how cavalier these guys were.
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:38.080]   That to me is the issue, not that somebody's gotten, you know, was a sexual harasser at
[00:25:38.080 --> 00:25:39.640]   some place in Hollywood.
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:40.640]   That never happens.
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:43.560]   You know, we talked a little bit on security now about this.
[00:25:43.560 --> 00:25:49.400]   And one thing I think-- even Steve Gibson, who is a security guru and kind of lives by
[00:25:49.400 --> 00:25:55.520]   the notion that it's possible to secure stuff, otherwise, why be a security expert, even
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:26:01.000]   he said there's very few companies that wouldn't be vulnerable to this kind of attack, that
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:04.240]   wouldn't have this kind of stuff unencrypted on their servers.
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:10.320]   This is probably-- and certainly no motion picture company-- the problem is that in order
[00:26:10.320 --> 00:26:14.680]   to get business done, you have to kind of-- you know, to be fully secure, you need to
[00:26:14.680 --> 00:26:18.040]   silo stuff and encrypt stuff and limit access to stuff.
[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:20.560]   But to get business done, you need to kind of almost do the opposite.
[00:26:20.560 --> 00:26:23.440]   People need to be able to freely speak in emails.
[00:26:23.440 --> 00:26:27.040]   They need to be able to see stuff, spreadsheets need to be shared.
[00:26:27.040 --> 00:26:30.760]   And so there is this kind of mismatch between the needs of high--
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:31.760]   I am sure--
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:34.720]   And make a sound as though Hollywood couldn't get any business done before the internet
[00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:36.240]   and before all these servers were there.
[00:26:36.240 --> 00:26:39.920]   Well, it's interesting because apparently one of the responses to this is no more emails
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:42.320]   and nothing in writing.
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:44.680]   They're doing everything by phone calls going forward.
[00:26:44.680 --> 00:26:45.680]   The olden days.
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:53.920]   And imagine if you were a producer, a director, an actor who was considering a contract with
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:56.800]   Sony, wouldn't you think twice now about that?
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:26:58.560]   It depends on how much money was involved.
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:26:59.560]   I don't know.
[00:26:59.560 --> 00:27:00.560]   I don't trust that information.
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:02.560]   It depends on what this letter was.
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:08.220]   Mashable has just published nine minutes ago, a piece in which Sony pictures a sent
[00:27:08.220 --> 00:27:12.480]   a letter to several media outlets demanding that they delete troves of emails delivered
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:13.480]   by hackers.
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:18.880]   I presume Christina has gotten some of those.
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:22.880]   And that they are essentially-- sounds like they're threatening you.
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:28.820]   I'm curious, Christina, have you mentioned that you're getting emails from the hackers?
[00:27:28.820 --> 00:27:34.360]   Have you by any chance heard from law enforcement about we'd like to talk to you, young lady?
[00:27:34.360 --> 00:27:40.180]   Oh, we lost Christina at a very--
[00:27:40.180 --> 00:27:41.180]   Yeah, and B.I.
[00:27:41.180 --> 00:27:42.180]   Just better off.
[00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:43.980]   A pivotal moment right there.
[00:27:43.980 --> 00:27:47.780]   We're going to get her back.
[00:27:47.780 --> 00:27:49.780]   There's a whole lot to this story that I think is--
[00:27:49.780 --> 00:27:50.780]   Well, incidents?
[00:27:50.780 --> 00:27:51.780]   --is of newsworthy.
[00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:57.060]   And as for instance, Sony and the Motion Picture Association of America created something-- and
[00:27:57.060 --> 00:28:02.700]   we learned this from these documents called Project Goliath in which they were going after
[00:28:02.700 --> 00:28:05.720]   Goliath is Google in this case, the code name for Google.
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:10.400]   They talked about the problems created by Goliath and worry, what would Goliath do if
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:13.120]   we went on attack?
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:17.520]   One of the things the Motion Picture Association of America and the studios continually believe
[00:28:17.520 --> 00:28:21.060]   is that Google's search enables piracy.
[00:28:21.060 --> 00:28:26.360]   They would love to get Google to stop linking to bit torrent sites and things like that.
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:27.840]   This is a search as search.
[00:28:27.840 --> 00:28:30.920]   And they even talked about-- well, I agree with you.
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:38.440]   They even talked about ways to actually block sites from reaching ISPs to in effect DDoS
[00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:40.000]   or block these sites--
[00:28:40.000 --> 00:28:42.360]   This is just censorship and different guides.
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:47.040]   So I think there is some that is more than just gossip in here.
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:50.300]   But I think-- we don't want to repeat the gossip.
[00:28:50.300 --> 00:28:51.380]   We're not going to repeat the gossip here.
[00:28:51.380 --> 00:28:53.500]   I don't think that's the story for us anyway.
[00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:54.500]   I really--
[00:28:54.500 --> 00:28:55.500]   Yeah.
[00:28:55.500 --> 00:29:00.160]   I think the story for us is, first of all, that Sony kind of ignored security entirely,
[00:29:00.160 --> 00:29:04.560]   according to Elizabeth Barber writing in Time magazine.
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:08.640]   They had been hacked in February of this year.
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:13.240]   They knew its servers were vulnerable according to Gawker for at least a year before the hacking
[00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:14.480]   incident.
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:20.360]   In fact, Gawker quotes an email, they had February 12th of this year from Sony's vice president
[00:29:20.360 --> 00:29:25.160]   of legal compliance, Courtney Schaberg, telling her colleagues a Sony server may have been
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:31.320]   hacked, but she would "recommend against providing any notification to individuals."
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:34.240]   That they, in fact, wanted to bury these hacks.
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:35.400]   And that's pretty interesting.
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:37.520]   And then there was also the PlayStation hack.
[00:29:37.520 --> 00:29:38.520]   And they--
[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:39.520]   Yeah, they had the footer.
[00:29:39.520 --> 00:29:40.520]   PlayStation hack.
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:41.520]   PlayStation hack was down for weeks.
[00:29:41.520 --> 00:29:42.520]   20 pictures was hacked before.
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:43.520]   Ah, she's back.
[00:29:43.520 --> 00:29:44.520]   Now you can ask her that question.
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:45.520]   I'm back.
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:50.600]   Yeah, so yeah, my question was before the FBI cut you off, Christina, was, "Have you heard
[00:29:50.600 --> 00:29:53.480]   from law enforcement about this where they want to talk to you?"
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:56.960]   I mean, if you're getting emails from the hackers, and obviously they're going to cover
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:30:00.960]   their tracks, if you're getting emails from the hackers, are you--
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:04.160]   Are you been contacted by law enforcement?
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:05.160]   I have not.
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:06.160]   I have not.
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:09.400]   And if I was, I'd be happy to turn over any of the emails from the hackers, which are
[00:30:09.400 --> 00:30:12.240]   coming from hushmail addresses and other things that they wanted to have those that
[00:30:12.240 --> 00:30:15.000]   would be-- I'd be more than happy to turn that over.
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.080]   When it comes to David Boyes and it has he said anything to my knowledge, he hasn't
[00:30:18.080 --> 00:30:19.080]   said anything to Mashable yet.
[00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:20.560]   I haven't received any communications.
[00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:23.880]   I'm not sure if he's sent out a press thing or not.
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:26.520]   That would be-- our legal counsel would have to take that over.
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:27.520]   That's not my pay grade.
[00:30:27.520 --> 00:30:29.240]   That's someone above me.
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:35.040]   But as far as we know, we're standing by our reporting and we're far from the only organization
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:36.240]   that's done this.
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:41.240]   I think that trying to intimidate people to not publish stuff, especially when there
[00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:46.200]   is proof, as you were just mentioning, gawk, or fighting out that there was potentially
[00:30:46.200 --> 00:30:50.480]   they were aware of someone being in the systems and they're not wanting to let people
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:55.560]   know, that sort of negligence, especially when it comes to the inevitable class action lawsuits,
[00:30:55.560 --> 00:31:00.680]   the individual brain compilers, please are going to be-- I think that becomes really
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:03.240]   valid and really interesting.
[00:31:03.240 --> 00:31:09.640]   I think the fact that they've had such despicable internal information security at Sony is something
[00:31:09.640 --> 00:31:13.000]   that most of my early reporting was not before the emails leaked.
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:15.800]   Had didn't have anything to do with any of the salacious stuff.
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:23.760]   It was all about the fact that this is how terrible this was and how Sony's own internal
[00:31:23.760 --> 00:31:25.720]   policies made this so much worse.
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:29.040]   I think that that's worth harping on and worth investigating, especially as we try to figure
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:35.280]   out who's behind this and what their motive is, which it seems to be financial.
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:37.480]   I don't think so.
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:39.640]   I have a theory.
[00:31:39.640 --> 00:31:43.760]   I understand the financial because they said they're blackmailing Sony, except that was
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:45.760]   not-- there has to be some-- there wasn't where that's going.
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:49.920]   Well, they claim if you don't give us some money, but I don't think that there was really
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:54.160]   a strong attempt to get money on a Sony.
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:57.600]   I think this goes back to 2005 when--
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:59.080]   Here we go.
[00:31:59.080 --> 00:32:04.840]   Sony Music-- you may remember this-- distributed music CDs with root kits on them.
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:05.840]   Yeah.
[00:32:05.840 --> 00:32:06.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:07.840]   Those were terrible.
[00:32:07.840 --> 00:32:09.840]   And it modified Windows so you couldn't tell it's there.
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:13.640]   It's a different organization within the company.
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:14.640]   I'm sorry.
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:16.640]   You're-- your birth cap is breaking up.
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:19.960]   Yeah, you go on, Leo.
[00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:26.800]   Remember that this was incredibly infuriating to people, particularly, I think a certain
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:32.400]   class of people who then have continually taken it out on Sony ever since.
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:37.920]   I think the Sony PlayStation Network hack was as a result of the bad publicity Sony
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:41.120]   got for this root kit and then other bad things that they did on the PlayStation Network.
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:42.120]   Yeah, but they didn't do it.
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:43.520]   It wasn't a malicious root kit.
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:46.480]   They just-- they were idiots and they put this root kit in there because somebody told them
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:48.680]   it was a great idea.
[00:32:48.680 --> 00:32:50.160]   They weren't trying to screw anybody with you.
[00:32:50.160 --> 00:32:51.160]   Yeah, I think that's--
[00:32:51.160 --> 00:32:53.560]   I don't think it's a stretch at all.
[00:32:53.560 --> 00:32:57.760]   I think Sony got on somebody's bad side and they've been on their bad side ever since
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:03.440]   that the same people or at least descendants of the same people who perpetrated the Sony
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:06.400]   PlayStation Network hack are people who are involved in this.
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:08.120]   This is a revenge.
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:11.600]   This is somebody who's out to get Sony, has been out to get Sony for a long time.
[00:33:11.600 --> 00:33:12.600]   That's what I think.
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:15.480]   Did they do a bust in the PlayStation hack?
[00:33:15.480 --> 00:33:16.480]   Did they--
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:17.480]   Never caught anybody.
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:18.480]   They nailed somebody.
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:20.280]   Well, I'm not going to subscribe to this thesis.
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:21.280]   Why?
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:22.280]   You're the conspiracy guy.
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:23.280]   I thought you'd love the conspiracy guy.
[00:33:23.280 --> 00:33:27.480]   They didn't get those guys.
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:33.000]   Porcristina is operating about 30 seconds behind us because of her Skype woes.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   Go ahead.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:37.280]   Somebody did go to jail for the first Sony Pictures hack.
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:38.280]   Okay.
[00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:40.280]   Maybe that's the guy.
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:41.280]   I'm sorry.
[00:33:41.280 --> 00:33:47.160]   I'm just going to say that you're operating in a severe disadvantage.
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:54.520]   Sony-- 77 million PlayStation Network customers and 25 million Sony online entertainment customers
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:33:56.920]   were hacked in effect.
[00:33:56.920 --> 00:33:59.680]   Their information was revealed in this PlayStation hack.
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:03.720]   You may remember that the PlayStation Network was shut down for several weeks because of
[00:34:03.720 --> 00:34:04.720]   this.
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:06.920]   According to Reuters, this goes back to 2011.
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:15.080]   Sony's hired detectives from Guidance Software, Protivity, and Data Forte to find these hackers,
[00:34:15.080 --> 00:34:17.240]   and they think it came from a Malaysia-based server.
[00:34:17.240 --> 00:34:20.800]   By the way, this is as credible as the fact that this came from North Korea.
[00:34:20.800 --> 00:34:23.480]   It's almost impossible if the hackers are doing their job right.
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:24.480]   Right.
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:26.280]   It could be to track these people and know where they're from.
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:28.760]   Probably Ukraine, if any place.
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:32.240]   It's clear that Sony doesn't care so much about security, even though they have every
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:33.760]   reason to care.
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:35.320]   They continually get hacked.
[00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:38.120]   I think we don't know how continually.
[00:34:38.120 --> 00:34:41.600]   I think there's been an ongoing campaign against Sony since 2005.
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:44.000]   Well, that's because your thesis is based on that.
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   Yes.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   That's what I said.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   I think that.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:48.600]   I don't have any evidence of that.
[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:53.520]   So there's another high-profile hack that's in the news today, the Sands Casino.
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:54.520]   Yeah.
[00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:56.600]   And that was a revenge hack.
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:57.600]   Yes.
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:58.840]   Oh, I don't know about this.
[00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:00.840]   Oh, this is a great show.
[00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:02.440]   We all know, Shelley.
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:03.440]   Yeah.
[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:09.160]   So Sheldon Adenson, who is one of the richest men in the world, $42 billion worth, runs the
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:16.560]   Sands Casino and is, of course, a very outspoken advocate for Israel, funded an anti-Obama campaign
[00:35:16.560 --> 00:35:17.560]   in 2008.
[00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:18.560]   Who was it?
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:19.560]   Gingrich.
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:20.560]   Gingrich.
[00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:21.560]   You okay?
[00:35:21.560 --> 00:35:22.560]   Yeah, there we go.
[00:35:22.560 --> 00:35:23.560]   He's hacking.
[00:35:23.560 --> 00:35:24.560]   He's hacking.
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:25.560]   He's hacking.
[00:35:25.560 --> 00:35:30.160]   So apparently Iranian state hackers brought down the sands.
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:35.160]   I find this hard to believe it okay.
[00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:37.400]   Well you don't believe anything, but this one's true.
[00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:40.160]   Apparently I don't believe anything.
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:44.280]   This one actually, I think they not claim responsibility.
[00:35:44.280 --> 00:35:49.360]   I think Iranians have claimed responsibility, but I don't think necessarily that it can
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:51.560]   be tied to the state.
[00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:55.760]   Although it may be, you know, a lot of these things where you talk about the state doing
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:36:00.000]   it is oftentimes I'm not necessarily sure like there's a general somewhere saying,
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.600]   you know, go hack.
[00:36:01.600 --> 00:36:06.160]   I think what's happening is you have people who are aware of this, who are sympathetic,
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:09.120]   who have the skills to do it, and they just do it.
[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:14.040]   And they may be located in Iran, but they may not necessarily be, you know, necessarily
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:15.360]   employees of the government.
[00:36:15.360 --> 00:36:21.120]   Great story in Bloomberg Business Week by Ben Elgin and Michael Riley detailing this hack,
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:29.680]   which cost its estimated 40, cost sands for, and Shelley, $40 million.
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:30.680]   You know, I don't know.
[00:36:30.680 --> 00:36:31.680]   Is it Iran?
[00:36:31.680 --> 00:36:37.440]   Is it somebody in Iran who has the support of the Iranian government?
[00:36:37.440 --> 00:36:38.600]   I don't know.
[00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:42.040]   It'd be the US government for all you.
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:44.400]   There wasn't do most of the hacking.
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:50.200]   Well, and there are warnings that the Iranians are going after the energy industry.
[00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:54.640]   That's a Reuters story from this week, as well as other companies.
[00:36:54.640 --> 00:37:00.120]   I know in Houston, everybody here is very nervous about, you know, state operated hacking, and
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:04.960]   there's a lot of efforts being made to particularly educate energy industry employees not to fall
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:05.960]   for fishing attacks.
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:10.360]   Yeah, the first thing you would attack would be the power plants, right?
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:11.360]   Right.
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:17.760]   We in Israel hacked the Iranian centrifuges with Stuxnet to slow down their nuclear enrichment
[00:37:17.760 --> 00:37:19.680]   program.
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:25.680]   So yeah, I guess they don't know exactly who hacked the sands.
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:30.680]   The investigators who have been investigating this working for the sands.
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:32.440]   This attack, by the way, occurred in February.
[00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:33.920]   We're just now learning about it.
[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:38.880]   Say it was likely the work of hacktivists based in Iran, but they couldn't determine
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:43.880]   if the Iranian government played a role, but says Dell secure works.
[00:37:43.880 --> 00:37:47.640]   It's unlikely that any hackers inside the country could pull off an attack of that scope
[00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:54.320]   without government knowledge, given the close scrutiny of internet use within its borders.
[00:37:54.320 --> 00:37:57.760]   James Lewis, senior fellow at the Center for Strategic and International Studies in Washington,
[00:37:57.760 --> 00:38:02.440]   D.C., said, "This isn't the kind of business you can get into in Iran without the government
[00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:03.640]   knowing."
[00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:07.560]   I think that's fairly safe to say.
[00:38:07.560 --> 00:38:09.360]   So cost Shelley 40 mil.
[00:38:09.360 --> 00:38:11.560]   Shelley can afford it.
[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:14.560]   We know Shelley because Sheldon Adelson started Comdex.
[00:38:14.560 --> 00:38:15.560]   Yes.
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:17.200]   In fact, that's where he got all his money, right?
[00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:18.200]   Yeah.
[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:19.200]   Selling it, he got a...
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:20.200]   Just the right time.
[00:38:20.200 --> 00:38:21.200]   A billion dollars.
[00:38:21.200 --> 00:38:22.200]   Yeah.
[00:38:22.200 --> 00:38:23.360]   He saw that running on the wall.
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:29.240]   So for a billion bucks, I think he already bought the sands somewhere in the middle, leveled
[00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:36.160]   it, blew it up, created the Venetian, and then leveraged that until he could create this
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:37.160]   huge...
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:39.520]   Gambling with the coal.
[00:38:39.520 --> 00:38:40.520]   ...an empire.
[00:38:40.520 --> 00:38:44.280]   He created some large empire with 40 billion.
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:48.240]   The sands in the days after the attack in February told the press only that its websites
[00:38:48.240 --> 00:38:52.840]   had been vandalized and some office productivity systems, including email, weren't working.
[00:38:52.840 --> 00:38:58.200]   So the hackers got mad and they posted a video, an 11 minute video on YouTube, set to
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:39:01.480]   Carl Orfe Ofortuna.
[00:39:01.480 --> 00:39:04.920]   You know, that's the one they use in all the horror movies.
[00:39:04.920 --> 00:39:05.920]   Damien.
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:06.920]   Yeah.
[00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:07.920]   Yes.
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:08.920]   Yeah.
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:10.840]   It began by scrolling through a news article that highlighted Adelson's comments about nuking
[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:15.760]   Iran, then showed a computer screen packed with thousands of files and photos with names
[00:39:15.760 --> 00:39:21.480]   like IT passwords and casino credit, which had been stolen from the sands.
[00:39:21.480 --> 00:39:23.680]   In the video, an unseen hacker, by the way, it's gone.
[00:39:23.680 --> 00:39:24.680]   You do.
[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:25.680]   A law enforcement took it down.
[00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:30.560]   An unseen hacker clicks into a disk drive titled "Damn A" and then there's a folder containing
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:32.640]   a terabyte of data.
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:33.920]   The text box appears.
[00:39:33.920 --> 00:39:37.640]   Do you really think only your email server has been taken down?
[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:39.960]   Like hell it has.
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:43.680]   I think this sounds a lot like the GOP hack.
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:46.840]   I guess this is not going to get any better.
[00:39:46.840 --> 00:39:50.160]   I don't know what people are going to expect in the future, but these hacks are going to
[00:39:50.160 --> 00:39:51.280]   just get worse and worse.
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:57.680]   Well, and I think that I suppose we know how to really secure something, but it isn't
[00:39:57.680 --> 00:39:59.760]   really practical.
[00:39:59.760 --> 00:40:04.520]   Sony, you know, Sony is practical if you don't mind the inconvenience, but it's hard
[00:40:04.520 --> 00:40:06.680]   to do business with a truly secure system.
[00:40:06.680 --> 00:40:07.680]   And I think that's the one.
[00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:11.400]   They had to do business before because there was no internet.
[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:14.800]   Now there's an internet and they can't do business the old fashioned way.
[00:40:14.800 --> 00:40:16.360]   I know a wine store.
[00:40:16.360 --> 00:40:18.040]   Come on down to the brown Derby.
[00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:19.040]   Let's talk.
[00:40:19.040 --> 00:40:21.080]   I want to make a movie with you, kid.
[00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:22.080]   That's the old fashioned way.
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:23.080]   And it worked?
[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:24.200]   Maybe at the brown Derby.
[00:40:24.200 --> 00:40:26.640]   Take movies like "Godfather 1, 2, and 3."
[00:40:26.640 --> 00:40:27.640]   Those were reasonably good movies.
[00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:29.400]   There was no internet back in the day.
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.840]   That's the days when they had a telephone on your table.
[00:40:31.840 --> 00:40:32.840]   Yeah.
[00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:33.840]   So you could show how powerful you were.
[00:40:33.840 --> 00:40:34.840]   I had a cell phone.
[00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:35.840]   By taking a call.
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:36.840]   Yeah.
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:40.280]   Well, what was actually interesting about a lot of the emails is that there were certain
[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:44.200]   conversations that they very clearly knew not to have over email.
[00:40:44.200 --> 00:40:45.480]   And they said, "Okay, I'll call you.
[00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:47.720]   I can't talk about this over email."
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:51.760]   And there were certain exchanges that got between Amy Pascal and Scott Roodin.
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:54.160]   They got forwarded to Michael and to the CEO.
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:57.480]   And he actually said, "I can't believe the two of you would say this over email."
[00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:02.400]   So it's one of those funny things that even what we were able to get is obviously only
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:03.480]   parts of the story.
[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:08.200]   They were aware that there are certain things and certain conversations they shouldn't have
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:12.000]   over email just for standard practices and the fact that people can forward things and
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:13.720]   stuff can leak.
[00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:18.000]   So yeah, I mean, I think that it probably isn't a bad idea for if there's something truly
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:23.640]   sensitive or truly important that you don't want a paper trail for, then don't leave a
[00:41:23.640 --> 00:41:24.880]   paper trail.
[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:31.240]   The first upload of stolen data from the Sony hack was made in Thailand from the Wi-Fi network
[00:41:31.240 --> 00:41:33.000]   of the St. Regis Bangkok.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   Yep.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.800]   It's not a cheesy hotel I might add.
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:39.800]   Yeah.
[00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:44.120]   Well, do you think they drove down from South Korea and North Korea?
[00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:45.120]   North Korea.
[00:41:45.120 --> 00:41:46.120]   They just drove down.
[00:41:46.120 --> 00:41:47.120]   North Korea.
[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:48.120]   They think they got to the left.
[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:49.120]   There was a vacation.
[00:41:49.120 --> 00:41:50.120]   They got to the left.
[00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:51.120]   They got to the left.
[00:41:51.120 --> 00:41:52.120]   They got to the left.
[00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:53.120]   They got to the left.
[00:41:53.120 --> 00:41:54.120]   They got to the left.
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:41:55.120]   They got to the left.
[00:41:55.120 --> 00:41:56.120]   They got to the left.
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:57.120]   They got to the left.
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:58.120]   They got to the left.
[00:41:58.120 --> 00:41:59.120]   They got to the left.
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:00.120]   They got to the left.
[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:01.120]   They got to the left.
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:02.120]   They got to the left.
[00:42:02.120 --> 00:42:03.120]   That's our government.
[00:42:03.120 --> 00:42:04.120]   Some comments about the interview.
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:05.120]   That's bullish.
[00:42:05.120 --> 00:42:06.120]   It's our government.
[00:42:06.120 --> 00:42:09.200]   No, some of their stuff said that and they used some Korean terms.
[00:42:09.200 --> 00:42:12.960]   But yeah, I would actually say that I think that it was actually probably some of the
[00:42:12.960 --> 00:42:16.840]   Sony people and maybe some of their security people that were kind of spreading the meme
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:19.240]   that North Korea was involved.
[00:42:19.240 --> 00:42:22.440]   But it's good for box office.
[00:42:22.440 --> 00:42:25.280]   Well, did the problem?
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:29.560]   Did you see actually somebody, somebody in deadline wrote what had to be the biggest
[00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:33.920]   like French kiss to Sony I've ever seen in my life that said that every American needs
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:37.760]   to go see the interview because can't look the terrorist win.
[00:42:37.760 --> 00:42:38.760]   Oh my God.
[00:42:38.760 --> 00:42:39.760]   Good luck with that.
[00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:42.440]   And it by the way, looks like the worst movie ever.
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:43.440]   It does.
[00:42:43.440 --> 00:42:46.680]   People, they're talking about it and then they show the trailers.
[00:42:46.680 --> 00:42:48.840]   You would look at this trailer and say, I don't want to see this movie.
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:49.840]   It looks like garbage.
[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:53.560]   Seth Rogen and James Franco crawling around on a sofa sniffing each other's butts.
[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:54.960]   This does not seem to me.
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:55.960]   It's gone to the dogs.
[00:42:55.960 --> 00:42:57.720]   To be American family entertainment.
[00:42:57.720 --> 00:42:58.720]   Like we knew, John.
[00:42:58.720 --> 00:42:59.720]   Yeah.
[00:42:59.720 --> 00:43:04.440]   When I was a kid before the internet, whatever happened to Crosby and Hope, we're off on
[00:43:04.440 --> 00:43:07.040]   the road to Damascus.
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:11.560]   This is me bringing out the worst of you, by the way, Korean.
[00:43:11.560 --> 00:43:13.680]   It's the hangover for.
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:18.640]   Basically, basically, or you know, pineapple express to which actually has been made at
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:19.640]   Sony.
[00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:21.640]   No, no, please go.
[00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:23.200]   I don't care about the terrorists.
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:25.280]   I just don't want Sony to win.
[00:43:25.280 --> 00:43:26.280]   Right.
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:31.200]   But it's very funny, though, that the fact that, you know, obviously the op-ed was written
[00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:33.560]   in such a way, I was like, oh, this is deadline.
[00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:34.680]   Staying on Sony's good side.
[00:43:34.680 --> 00:43:36.760]   Please continue to give us information.
[00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:38.160]   Please, please, please love us.
[00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:41.640]   We're going to write this, this flowery op-ed about how if everyone doesn't see this movie,
[00:43:41.640 --> 00:43:43.280]   the terrorists win.
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:45.200]   Which being come on.
[00:43:45.200 --> 00:43:46.200]   That's kind of hard to put.
[00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:47.200]   That is a big French kiss.
[00:43:47.200 --> 00:43:48.200]   Yeah.
[00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:51.440]   No, when I saw that on Friday, literally, I started laughing at loud and my colleagues
[00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:55.600]   were turning around looking at me and I go, I just saw the biggest, you know, lap dog article
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:57.400]   I've ever seen in my entire life.
[00:43:57.400 --> 00:44:01.200]   You know, I didn't think that you could actually make a case to try to turn this into a publicity
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:02.400]   stunt, but there you go.
[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:06.600]   A little word of warning to Sony, the Department of Justice has already said, companies trying
[00:44:06.600 --> 00:44:12.120]   to hack the bad guys back would be subject to criminal penalties under the computer fraud
[00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:13.120]   and abuse act.
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:15.200]   So don't do it.
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:16.680]   Don't take the law into your own hands.
[00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:18.360]   No, no vigilantes, please.
[00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:20.720]   No vigilante justice.
[00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:22.520]   Sorry, Sony.
[00:44:22.520 --> 00:44:27.280]   Don't just say that other people hate Sony and they just want to everybody wants to
[00:44:27.280 --> 00:44:28.280]   screw with Sony.
[00:44:28.280 --> 00:44:30.480]   Everybody's bitching about no commercials in this show.
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:31.680]   Nobody's saying bring out work.
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:32.680]   Yes.
[00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:33.680]   Some people want to pee.
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:37.680]   Some people in the chat are saying they need to, they need a break.
[00:44:37.680 --> 00:44:39.240]   No, there were.
[00:44:39.240 --> 00:44:40.240]   She's right.
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:41.240]   They were.
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:43.440]   I'm not sure that is exactly the message.
[00:44:43.440 --> 00:44:45.320]   We want to get to go to the bathroom.
[00:44:45.320 --> 00:44:48.280]   There's people, many of them really are holding this commercial now.
[00:44:48.280 --> 00:44:50.800]   So you can all go pee.
[00:44:50.800 --> 00:44:54.240]   It's not the message I want to send our advertising.
[00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:56.000]   Well, it depends.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:58.440]   It may be for a toilet.
[00:44:58.440 --> 00:44:59.440]   It isn't.
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:00.440]   It's for something so much better.
[00:45:00.440 --> 00:45:01.680]   It's for Citrix code of meeting.
[00:45:01.680 --> 00:45:03.040]   Oh, well, there you go.
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:04.040]   Well, there you go.
[00:45:04.040 --> 00:45:05.040]   Hey, don't go pee yet.
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:07.160]   I've got to tell you about go to meeting.
[00:45:07.160 --> 00:45:09.680]   It is the most.
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:14.480]   This is, please take this seriously.
[00:45:14.480 --> 00:45:19.600]   It's the most important tool for your business you will ever hear about.
[00:45:19.600 --> 00:45:22.640]   By the way, it's secure.
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:24.200]   There's never been a hack of go to meeting.
[00:45:24.200 --> 00:45:29.560]   It's absolutely a secure way to meet in HD video conferencing.
[00:45:29.560 --> 00:45:31.000]   You could see each other face to face.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.440]   You can share screens.
[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:36.680]   You could solve problems because meeting is the best way to kind of cut through that
[00:45:36.680 --> 00:45:37.840]   Gordian knot.
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:39.760]   You could close deals faster.
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:41.840]   You can do those presentations.
[00:45:41.840 --> 00:45:44.440]   The new clients create new opportunities.
[00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:46.200]   Clients love it.
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:47.480]   Clients, trust me.
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:53.280]   They don't want you to fly out and sit in their lobby and then come take up their time
[00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:55.160]   with your PowerPoint presentation.
[00:45:55.160 --> 00:45:58.400]   They would much rather you say, "Hey, let's have a go to meeting.
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:45:59.400]   It's fast.
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:00.400]   It's easy.
[00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:01.400]   You get to the point.
[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:02.400]   They get what they need.
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:03.400]   You get what you need.
[00:46:03.400 --> 00:46:04.400]   Go to meeting."
[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:08.440]   If you've got a team distributed as most of us do all over the place, it's the easiest
[00:46:08.440 --> 00:46:11.640]   way, eliminates the cost, the time of travel.
[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:13.440]   You can share screens to review documents.
[00:46:13.440 --> 00:46:15.860]   You can collaborate on documents together.
[00:46:15.860 --> 00:46:17.560]   You can present in real time.
[00:46:17.560 --> 00:46:21.540]   Again, that built-in HD video conferencing is as good as face-to-face meaning.
[00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:23.420]   You can see their body language.
[00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:24.460]   You can see their faces.
[00:46:24.460 --> 00:46:25.660]   They see you.
[00:46:25.660 --> 00:46:29.740]   You'll cut out the wasted time and expensive travel without losing the personal touch.
[00:46:29.740 --> 00:46:32.820]   I want you to try go to meeting free for 30 days.
[00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:36.740]   We don't really don't even ever do a meeting without go to meeting.
[00:46:36.740 --> 00:46:39.860]   It's just the easiest way to meet.
[00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:42.700]   You send an email or it's automatic.
[00:46:42.700 --> 00:46:43.700]   They click a link.
[00:46:43.700 --> 00:46:44.700]   They're in.
[00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:45.700]   They're doing it.
[00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:46.700]   You can try it free button.
[00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:48.300]   You've got it for 30 days.
[00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:49.300]   Absolutely free.
[00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:53.580]   Go to meeting.com.
[00:46:53.580 --> 00:47:00.060]   We thank the great folks at Citrix for their longtime support of the Twit Network.
[00:47:00.060 --> 00:47:01.900]   Well, you did a great job.
[00:47:01.900 --> 00:47:06.060]   If anybody wants to read about the ins and outs of the jobs movie, which left Sony because
[00:47:06.060 --> 00:47:10.740]   they couldn't make a deal, something about Angelina Jolie being a talentless immature
[00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:11.740]   baby.
[00:47:11.740 --> 00:47:15.220]   I didn't think she was going to be a good Steve Jobs anyway.
[00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:17.500]   I think she would have been it was counter.
[00:47:17.500 --> 00:47:19.500]   It was brilliant casting.
[00:47:19.500 --> 00:47:24.300]   Actually, what was that movie about Bob Dylan that had everybody's Bob Dylan?
[00:47:24.300 --> 00:47:25.300]   Oh, yeah.
[00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:26.300]   That was great.
[00:47:26.300 --> 00:47:27.300]   You're not there.
[00:47:27.300 --> 00:47:28.300]   I'm not there.
[00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:29.300]   Yeah.
[00:47:29.300 --> 00:47:30.300]   I'm not there.
[00:47:30.300 --> 00:47:31.780]   Todd Haynes directed that.
[00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:32.780]   That was a great film.
[00:47:32.780 --> 00:47:34.100]   Yeah, it was a great movie.
[00:47:34.100 --> 00:47:35.100]   Weird.
[00:47:35.100 --> 00:47:36.540]   I don't know how you got from here to there.
[00:47:36.540 --> 00:47:38.780]   Well, because Cape Lechamp played to Bob Dylan.
[00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:39.780]   Right.
[00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:40.780]   Oh, I see.
[00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:42.780]   I get it.
[00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:48.700]   Canadian court rules police officers can search cell phones without a warrant and civil rights,
[00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:50.860]   civil liberties activists in Canada.
[00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:51.860]   Cheer.
[00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:53.020]   Why would they cheer?
[00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:56.620]   Because then they can take the photos off and exchange them with each other like they
[00:47:56.620 --> 00:48:00.340]   did in the California, California, the CHP.
[00:48:00.340 --> 00:48:01.700]   And that would be cool.
[00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:06.940]   Turns out this is actually more restricted than previous Canadian law.
[00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:10.580]   In the past, there was nothing to stop a police officer from saying, give me your phone.
[00:48:10.580 --> 00:48:13.620]   I want to see if there's any good pictures on it.
[00:48:13.620 --> 00:48:14.940]   Now you did not know that.
[00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:15.940]   Now there are rules.
[00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:18.060]   The arrest must be lawful.
[00:48:18.060 --> 00:48:19.940]   Police need a valid reason for the search.
[00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:22.300]   I want to see if there's any nude pictures on there.
[00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:25.180]   The search must be limited to the suspected crime.
[00:48:25.180 --> 00:48:26.180]   This is the most important.
[00:48:26.180 --> 00:48:29.780]   Police have to keep detailed records of the search.
[00:48:29.780 --> 00:48:35.780]   So while initially it looks as if Canada is going the wrong direction on this, in fact,
[00:48:35.780 --> 00:48:38.580]   this is an improvement over the preliminary.
[00:48:38.580 --> 00:48:43.860]   The previous law officers in Canada had an unfettered, virtually unfettered right to
[00:48:43.860 --> 00:48:46.780]   search a cell phone during an arrest.
[00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:48.820]   And now it's unfailing polite.
[00:48:48.820 --> 00:48:50.220]   But you've got to be polite.
[00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:51.220]   That's right.
[00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:52.220]   You have to be polite.
[00:48:52.220 --> 00:48:53.220]   Excuse me, sir.
[00:48:53.220 --> 00:48:54.220]   May I search your phone?
[00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:55.220]   No.
[00:48:55.220 --> 00:48:59.140]   But here in the United States, the Supreme Court has ruled that police need a warrant to search
[00:48:59.140 --> 00:49:00.460]   your phone.
[00:49:00.460 --> 00:49:01.900]   So let's keep that in mind.
[00:49:01.900 --> 00:49:02.900]   Yeah.
[00:49:02.900 --> 00:49:04.380]   And then I'll stop them.
[00:49:04.380 --> 00:49:08.540]   And the Fifth Amendment means that they can't ask you for your password.
[00:49:08.540 --> 00:49:13.580]   You have the right to not self-incriminate, but they can press your finger against the
[00:49:13.580 --> 00:49:14.980]   touch ID.
[00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:15.980]   So here's my question.
[00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:19.700]   Now, what if I just wanted to press the finger that I don't have connected to touch ID?
[00:49:19.700 --> 00:49:20.700]   Oh, one of them works.
[00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:22.020]   So if I have an action to restart it, exactly.
[00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:23.860]   And I use it my five tries.
[00:49:23.860 --> 00:49:25.340]   And then all of a sudden, like, you know what?
[00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:27.460]   I'm not sure why this isn't working, you guys.
[00:49:27.460 --> 00:49:29.060]   And then it's like, oh, you want the code?
[00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:30.260]   I'm sorry.
[00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:31.500]   I don't have to tell you that.
[00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:32.500]   Are you going to play the--
[00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:33.500]   Are you going to play the--
[00:49:33.500 --> 00:49:37.380]   Oh, I just don't know what I-- I don't know how this stuff works, officer.
[00:49:37.380 --> 00:49:38.380]   Like a Blanche or--
[00:49:38.380 --> 00:49:39.380]   Blanche or what's her name?
[00:49:39.380 --> 00:49:40.380]   I mean, I think that's--
[00:49:40.380 --> 00:49:41.380]   Blanche du Bois.
[00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:42.380]   Blanche du Bois.
[00:49:42.380 --> 00:49:47.540]   Well, I mean, I think it's either that or it's like, if my phone is bad enough that
[00:49:47.540 --> 00:49:55.140]   I'm like, this could be way worse than whatever they're going to do to me in the interim between,
[00:49:55.140 --> 00:49:59.860]   you know, they're going to be really angry at me for not using my fingerprint and what
[00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:04.940]   my phone is worse, then I would probably put up with whatever the punishment would be
[00:50:04.940 --> 00:50:09.300]   and just use a pinky or something that wasn't connected to it until I tried.
[00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:10.300]   I don't know.
[00:50:10.300 --> 00:50:12.620]   It's always worked in the past, officer.
[00:50:12.620 --> 00:50:14.380]   I just put my pinky on it.
[00:50:14.380 --> 00:50:15.540]   It doesn't relax it.
[00:50:15.540 --> 00:50:19.980]   I can't understand why it's not working.
[00:50:19.980 --> 00:50:20.980]   I don't know.
[00:50:20.980 --> 00:50:23.540]   I should do it with an obscure figure on the wrong hand.
[00:50:23.540 --> 00:50:26.700]   It's not a chokehold, honest.
[00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:27.700]   Let's see.
[00:50:27.700 --> 00:50:32.700]   What else you got on this list?
[00:50:32.700 --> 00:50:34.180]   I didn't get a copy of this.
[00:50:34.180 --> 00:50:35.740]   You didn't get a copy of this?
[00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:37.460]   Just read over my shoulder.
[00:50:37.460 --> 00:50:38.460]   Okay.
[00:50:38.460 --> 00:50:39.460]   Yeah.
[00:50:39.460 --> 00:50:41.460]   How about this one?
[00:50:41.460 --> 00:50:45.620]   This actually was something that Jeff Jarvis wanted to talk about on Wednesday on This
[00:50:45.620 --> 00:50:49.540]   Week in Google, but couldn't because it was embargoed, but it happened.
[00:50:49.540 --> 00:50:51.700]   Google has announced, that's it.
[00:50:51.700 --> 00:50:54.540]   We're not going to do Google News in Spain anymore.
[00:50:54.540 --> 00:50:55.540]   Good.
[00:50:55.540 --> 00:50:57.900]   I think this is the way Google should handle this stuff.
[00:50:57.900 --> 00:50:58.980]   I've always felt this way.
[00:50:58.980 --> 00:51:03.540]   A copyright law in Spain that actually doesn't take effect on this year.
[00:51:03.540 --> 00:51:09.220]   Google's in some odd way tends to be doing people a favor when they, because they have
[00:51:09.220 --> 00:51:10.220]   links.
[00:51:10.220 --> 00:51:15.860]   Well, they did this in, it was the publishers I think in Germany that, yeah, they wanted
[00:51:15.860 --> 00:51:19.780]   to charge Google for putting snippets from the stories.
[00:51:19.780 --> 00:51:20.780]   They said, "That's our content.
[00:51:20.780 --> 00:51:21.780]   You can't do that.
[00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:22.780]   You have to pay us."
[00:51:22.780 --> 00:51:25.740]   Google just turned it off and they lost so much traffic.
[00:51:25.740 --> 00:51:26.740]   They said, "Never mind.
[00:51:26.740 --> 00:51:28.260]   Please publish snippets."
[00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:34.660]   So in Spain, a really extremely aggressive law that would have compelled Google to pay
[00:51:34.660 --> 00:51:42.540]   licensing revenues to Spanish publishers if even a headline appeared in Google News.
[00:51:42.540 --> 00:51:45.180]   Google pointed out, "We actually don't make any money.
[00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:46.700]   There's no ads on Google News."
[00:51:46.700 --> 00:51:49.100]   Now, Google News is a loser.
[00:51:49.100 --> 00:51:51.660]   So money loser, that is.
[00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:56.460]   So they say, "It's with real sadness that on December 16th before the new law comes
[00:51:56.460 --> 00:52:01.860]   in effect in January, we are going to remove all Spanish publishers from Google News.
[00:52:01.860 --> 00:52:05.500]   We are going to close Google News in Spain."
[00:52:05.500 --> 00:52:12.140]   If you, the good news is there's a lot of Spanish language content out there and that
[00:52:12.140 --> 00:52:15.740]   will continue to appear on Google News.
[00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:18.860]   But none of those Spanish newspapers will get a single link from us.
[00:52:18.860 --> 00:52:19.860]   Good.
[00:52:19.860 --> 00:52:20.860]   That's revenge.
[00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:24.860]   I'd like to see them throwing their weight around.
[00:52:24.860 --> 00:52:25.860]   Do you want to see that?
[00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:27.860]   Do you really want to see what's going on?
[00:52:27.860 --> 00:52:29.420]   Well, only in these situations.
[00:52:29.420 --> 00:52:30.420]   It's not just all the time.
[00:52:30.420 --> 00:52:31.420]   This is such a ridiculous...
[00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:32.420]   Well, it's not throwing your weight around.
[00:52:32.420 --> 00:52:35.420]   It's kind of just passive aggressive.
[00:52:35.420 --> 00:52:40.220]   It feels like it feels like I'm going to take my ball and go home.
[00:52:40.220 --> 00:52:41.220]   Right.
[00:52:41.220 --> 00:52:42.220]   Kinda.
[00:52:42.220 --> 00:52:43.220]   You're going to get sued otherwise.
[00:52:43.220 --> 00:52:46.220]   Now the Spanish newspapers.
[00:52:46.220 --> 00:52:47.220]   Huh?
[00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:49.500]   No, there she goes again.
[00:52:49.500 --> 00:52:51.100]   Oh man, we have trouble with this.
[00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:52.100]   The Spanish newspapers.
[00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:54.540]   Now we're saying, I know.
[00:52:54.540 --> 00:52:55.780]   My husband's playing video games.
[00:52:55.780 --> 00:52:57.580]   Let me tell him to stop.
[00:52:57.580 --> 00:52:58.580]   Tell him to stop.
[00:52:58.580 --> 00:52:59.580]   What?
[00:52:59.580 --> 00:53:00.580]   What?
[00:53:00.580 --> 00:53:03.140]   He's downloading porn while you're doing the show.
[00:53:03.140 --> 00:53:04.580]   What video game is he playing?
[00:53:04.580 --> 00:53:06.060]   Basically.
[00:53:06.060 --> 00:53:08.820]   It's embarrassing for me to even admit it, so I'm not going to.
[00:53:08.820 --> 00:53:09.820]   Oh, come on.
[00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:10.820]   Tell.
[00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:15.060]   This is like Google pulling the Spanish news content from Google News.
[00:53:15.060 --> 00:53:16.700]   It's the same passive aggressive.
[00:53:16.700 --> 00:53:17.700]   Yes, tell us.
[00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:18.700]   It is.
[00:53:18.700 --> 00:53:19.700]   Come on, you can tell us.
[00:53:19.700 --> 00:53:20.900]   It's like, you know, who's going to know?
[00:53:20.900 --> 00:53:22.660]   He's playing League of Legends.
[00:53:22.660 --> 00:53:25.900]   No, he's playing some sort of weird second life game.
[00:53:25.900 --> 00:53:27.700]   Oh, second life.
[00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:30.300]   Oh, that's still a thing.
[00:53:30.300 --> 00:53:31.300]   Oh, that's not.
[00:53:31.300 --> 00:53:32.300]   I know.
[00:53:32.300 --> 00:53:33.300]   I know.
[00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:34.300]   Is he wearing his nude?
[00:53:34.300 --> 00:53:36.140]   Is he wearing his nude suit?
[00:53:36.140 --> 00:53:38.020]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:53:38.020 --> 00:53:41.020]   There's apparently a game within second life where everybody like it.
[00:53:41.020 --> 00:53:42.540]   There's a whole mafia thing going on.
[00:53:42.540 --> 00:53:43.540]   I don't even know.
[00:53:43.540 --> 00:53:44.540]   I'm like, just play Minecraft.
[00:53:44.540 --> 00:53:45.540]   Just play wild.
[00:53:45.540 --> 00:53:46.540]   Why are you doing this?
[00:53:46.540 --> 00:53:47.540]   I don't know.
[00:53:47.540 --> 00:53:51.420]   So like I said, it's humiliating for me because I mean, you know, this is married.
[00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:54.780]   Yeah, you may have a couple of wives in that game.
[00:53:54.780 --> 00:53:55.780]   You chose him.
[00:53:55.780 --> 00:53:58.580]   Who's your second life wife?
[00:53:58.580 --> 00:54:01.060]   I want to know.
[00:54:01.060 --> 00:54:02.900]   Is she beautiful?
[00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:05.100]   Oh, that's good.
[00:54:05.100 --> 00:54:06.100]   That's good.
[00:54:06.100 --> 00:54:08.940]   I actually have a friend that I'll share my embarrassment.
[00:54:08.940 --> 00:54:09.940]   Okay.
[00:54:09.940 --> 00:54:12.820]   I have a friend who's a second life photographer.
[00:54:12.820 --> 00:54:13.820]   What?
[00:54:13.820 --> 00:54:14.820]   He does.
[00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:15.820]   How does that even work?
[00:54:15.820 --> 00:54:21.980]   He publishes this on Facebook and I want to say, "You stay and I'll stop doing that."
[00:54:21.980 --> 00:54:26.780]   He poses people in second life and then takes pictures of them.
[00:54:26.780 --> 00:54:28.180]   Screen shots?
[00:54:28.180 --> 00:54:29.500]   I think there may be a tool.
[00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:30.820]   I don't know.
[00:54:30.820 --> 00:54:35.900]   And then he posts these fashion pictures from second life.
[00:54:35.900 --> 00:54:36.900]   No.
[00:54:36.900 --> 00:54:37.900]   Yeah.
[00:54:37.900 --> 00:54:40.460]   There is something about second life.
[00:54:40.460 --> 00:54:41.940]   I've never liked the idea.
[00:54:41.940 --> 00:54:43.380]   It's a little weird.
[00:54:43.380 --> 00:54:44.660]   Guys get really caught up in it.
[00:54:44.660 --> 00:54:45.660]   Do they?
[00:54:45.660 --> 00:54:50.580]   I mean, it's like a high-end professional attorney and he just loves second life and I don't know
[00:54:50.580 --> 00:54:52.140]   what he, you know, I don't know.
[00:54:52.140 --> 00:54:53.900]   Who is it we had on the triangulation?
[00:54:53.900 --> 00:54:55.660]   He's one of the founders of Second Life.
[00:54:55.660 --> 00:54:57.380]   I can't remember his name.
[00:54:57.380 --> 00:54:58.380]   Who is it?
[00:54:58.380 --> 00:54:59.380]   The London Labs.
[00:54:59.380 --> 00:55:00.380]   The London Labs.
[00:55:00.380 --> 00:55:01.380]   He was on triangulation.
[00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:02.380]   Why?
[00:55:02.380 --> 00:55:04.380]   You really listened to that conversation carefully.
[00:55:04.380 --> 00:55:05.380]   I wish I did.
[00:55:05.380 --> 00:55:06.860]   That must have been a good interview.
[00:55:06.860 --> 00:55:12.460]   Because he's still on the board at Second Life but I think he's doing a new thing like
[00:55:12.460 --> 00:55:13.460]   that.
[00:55:13.460 --> 00:55:14.460]   A new virtual world.
[00:55:14.460 --> 00:55:15.460]   Third life.
[00:55:15.460 --> 00:55:17.180]   Well, it all comes from Snow Crash, right?
[00:55:17.180 --> 00:55:19.100]   The metaverse in Snow Crash and Neel's.
[00:55:19.100 --> 00:55:20.940]   That's my understanding.
[00:55:20.940 --> 00:55:26.860]   I know that when Second Life was really hot, there was a lot of interest among publishers
[00:55:26.860 --> 00:55:28.100]   and particularly news fair.
[00:55:28.100 --> 00:55:29.100]   Yes.
[00:55:29.100 --> 00:55:30.100]   We could get in there.
[00:55:30.100 --> 00:55:32.260]   How can we get in there and get our content?
[00:55:32.260 --> 00:55:33.260]   Oh, yeah.
[00:55:33.260 --> 00:55:35.700]   And I was going, no, no, you don't want to do that.
[00:55:35.700 --> 00:55:38.420]   And then we're going to put in billboards up and they're setting up shop.
[00:55:38.420 --> 00:55:43.620]   There was a couple of PR agencies that were going to set up shop in the Second Life.
[00:55:43.620 --> 00:55:47.740]   Okay, the weirdest thing, the Maldives.
[00:55:47.740 --> 00:55:48.740]   What is that?
[00:55:48.740 --> 00:55:49.740]   It's an island.
[00:55:49.740 --> 00:55:50.740]   It's a Maldives.
[00:55:50.740 --> 00:55:51.740]   The Maldives.
[00:55:51.740 --> 00:55:52.740]   They had a consulate in Second Life.
[00:55:52.740 --> 00:55:53.740]   Yeah.
[00:55:53.740 --> 00:55:54.740]   Now I remember that.
[00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:55.740]   Remember that.
[00:55:55.740 --> 00:55:56.740]   Idiotic.
[00:55:56.740 --> 00:55:57.740]   We have, if you would like.
[00:55:57.740 --> 00:56:01.140]   I'm going to get divorced because of this and I'm going to blame you guys.
[00:56:01.140 --> 00:56:02.140]   It's our fault.
[00:56:02.140 --> 00:56:03.140]   You know what?
[00:56:03.140 --> 00:56:04.460]   If you get divorced, always blame us.
[00:56:04.460 --> 00:56:05.460]   It's not a big deal.
[00:56:05.460 --> 00:56:06.460]   I do.
[00:56:06.460 --> 00:56:07.460]   You're in New York.
[00:56:07.460 --> 00:56:08.460]   Every time.
[00:56:08.460 --> 00:56:09.460]   You're in New York.
[00:56:09.460 --> 00:56:10.460]   We're right here.
[00:56:10.460 --> 00:56:11.460]   Yeah.
[00:56:11.460 --> 00:56:13.100]   My husband's going to divorce me because I shared this.
[00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:14.100]   It's a secret shame.
[00:56:14.100 --> 00:56:15.100]   No.
[00:56:15.100 --> 00:56:16.100]   He's like smart guy.
[00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:17.100]   He knows that.
[00:56:17.100 --> 00:56:18.100]   He's a smart guy.
[00:56:18.100 --> 00:56:19.100]   We go to you.
[00:56:19.100 --> 00:56:21.900]   But I do have something he might be interested in.
[00:56:21.900 --> 00:56:26.140]   If he's sleeping on the couch tonight, may I recommend a Casper mattress?
[00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:27.620]   A Casper mattress.
[00:56:27.620 --> 00:56:29.700]   This is the segue of the decade.
[00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:30.700]   That is.
[00:56:30.700 --> 00:56:31.700]   That's excellently out.
[00:56:31.700 --> 00:56:33.220]   Stop sleeping on the couch.
[00:56:33.220 --> 00:56:34.900]   Get a lovely Casper mattress.
[00:56:34.900 --> 00:56:36.860]   They're super comfortable.
[00:56:36.860 --> 00:56:42.100]   They use latex for breathing and comfort in the memory phone on top to give you a mattress
[00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:44.540]   with just the right sink and bounce.
[00:56:44.540 --> 00:56:45.540]   They last forever.
[00:56:45.540 --> 00:56:46.780]   I love my Casper mattress.
[00:56:46.780 --> 00:56:49.700]   Here's a video of the Casper.
[00:56:49.700 --> 00:56:52.300]   This was a queen-sized Casper mattress.
[00:56:52.300 --> 00:56:54.380]   It comes in a little box.
[00:56:54.380 --> 00:56:56.260]   They actually deliver it to your door.
[00:56:56.260 --> 00:56:59.220]   You may say, "Well, I'm not going to buy a mattress side unseen."
[00:56:59.220 --> 00:57:00.220]   What?
[00:57:00.220 --> 00:57:02.900]   For those of you watching video, I'm opening the box.
[00:57:02.900 --> 00:57:06.740]   Inside, it says, "Leo, we hope you sleep like a queen."
[00:57:06.740 --> 00:57:07.740]   What is this supposed to mean?
[00:57:07.740 --> 00:57:08.740]   It's supposed to be the most of the queen.
[00:57:08.740 --> 00:57:11.300]   If that had gotten the king, maybe they would have said, "I hope you sleep like a king."
[00:57:11.300 --> 00:57:14.100]   If I'd gotten the twin, maybe they would have said, "I hope you sleep like a twin."
[00:57:14.100 --> 00:57:15.100]   I have a misunderstanding.
[00:57:15.100 --> 00:57:16.100]   Get it?
[00:57:16.100 --> 00:57:17.100]   It's like a little pun.
[00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:18.100]   Watch this.
[00:57:18.100 --> 00:57:19.100]   The mattress.
[00:57:19.100 --> 00:57:20.100]   It opens right up.
[00:57:20.100 --> 00:57:21.100]   Look at that.
[00:57:21.100 --> 00:57:22.100]   Oh, it's so comfortable.
[00:57:22.100 --> 00:57:25.020]   You can just dive right into that Casper.
[00:57:25.020 --> 00:57:26.820]   Oh, comfort.
[00:57:26.820 --> 00:57:27.820]   I liked it so much.
[00:57:27.820 --> 00:57:30.140]   I actually got one for my son in college.
[00:57:30.140 --> 00:57:31.140]   He loves it too.
[00:57:31.140 --> 00:57:33.020]   You may say, "Well, I'm not going to buy a mattress online.
[00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:34.020]   How do I know I don't feel?
[00:57:34.020 --> 00:57:36.340]   I want to go lie on it first."
[00:57:36.340 --> 00:57:37.900]   Studies show.
[00:57:37.900 --> 00:57:40.020]   I'm sure there's a study that will show this.
[00:57:40.020 --> 00:57:41.020]   That's me.
[00:57:41.020 --> 00:57:42.020]   What did you look like?
[00:57:42.020 --> 00:57:43.700]   Yeah, that's me.
[00:57:43.700 --> 00:57:44.700]   Huh.
[00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:49.580]   Studies show that going to a showroom and lying there in the middle of the day for five minutes
[00:57:49.580 --> 00:57:51.380]   with some showgirl looking at you.
[00:57:51.380 --> 00:57:54.300]   What quit show business?
[00:57:54.300 --> 00:57:56.780]   Is no way to choose a mattress.
[00:57:56.780 --> 00:58:00.020]   Casper lets you try these mattresses for 100 days.
[00:58:00.020 --> 00:58:03.340]   The liver is free and returns are free and easy.
[00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:05.420]   It's completely risk free.
[00:58:05.420 --> 00:58:07.020]   We've got a great deal too for you.

[00:58:21.740 --> 00:58:24.780]   That's a lot less expensive than a mattress at the mattress store.

[00:58:44.300 --> 00:58:45.300]   Guess what?
[00:58:45.300 --> 00:58:46.820]   You're not sleeping on the couch tonight.
[00:58:46.820 --> 00:58:49.580]   Actually, it would be you sleeping on the couch because you busted in.
[00:58:49.580 --> 00:58:54.860]   I was going to say, I'm the one who's in trouble here because it's my secret shame,
[00:58:54.860 --> 00:58:56.860]   but I mean, it's really his secret shame too.
[00:58:56.860 --> 00:58:58.500]   He enjoys it and I love my husband.
[00:58:58.500 --> 00:58:59.500]   No, that's fine.
[00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:00.500]   As long as he's not.
[00:59:00.500 --> 00:59:02.820]   You know, he will never listen to the show.
[00:59:02.820 --> 00:59:04.060]   No, this is true.
[00:59:04.060 --> 00:59:05.060]   He won't.
[00:59:05.060 --> 00:59:06.060]   No, he doesn't.
[00:59:06.060 --> 00:59:07.060]   He doesn't read what I write.
[00:59:07.060 --> 00:59:08.060]   He doesn't listen to my podcast.
[00:59:08.060 --> 00:59:09.060]   Tell us more stuff.
[00:59:09.060 --> 00:59:10.060]   This is true.
[00:59:10.060 --> 00:59:12.700]   How did this lucky guy get you?
[00:59:12.700 --> 00:59:14.460]   Does he work in the business?
[00:59:14.460 --> 00:59:15.460]   He does.
[00:59:15.460 --> 00:59:17.180]   He's a software engineer.
[00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:18.700]   He's a software engineer.
[00:59:18.700 --> 00:59:20.540]   But he used to be an editor.
[00:59:20.540 --> 00:59:22.620]   He used to write for a site called Download Squad.
[00:59:22.620 --> 00:59:24.420]   I remember Download Squad.
[00:59:24.420 --> 00:59:25.900]   He hired me.
[00:59:25.900 --> 00:59:28.300]   I worked Download Squad 2 and Grant hired me.
[00:59:28.300 --> 00:59:29.300]   Oh, you married the boss?
[00:59:29.300 --> 00:59:30.300]   Uh-oh.
[00:59:30.300 --> 00:59:31.300]   I did.
[00:59:31.300 --> 00:59:32.300]   It was very scandalous.
[00:59:32.300 --> 00:59:34.300]   Yes, it's lawsuit lurks shocking.
[00:59:34.300 --> 00:59:35.300]   You can blackmail him.
[00:59:35.300 --> 00:59:36.300]   You can blackmail him.
[00:59:36.300 --> 00:59:37.820]   He was able to hardly pay it enough.
[00:59:37.820 --> 00:59:40.820]   I think I think Grant is a very nice guy.
[00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:44.220]   He's a great guy and he's a very lucky guy.
[00:59:44.220 --> 00:59:48.380]   And I think, what game do you play while he's playing Second Life?
[00:59:48.380 --> 00:59:49.380]   Call of Duty.
[00:59:49.380 --> 00:59:50.380]   See?
[00:59:50.380 --> 00:59:51.380]   Call of Duty.
[00:59:51.380 --> 00:59:52.380]   You're being butcher people.
[00:59:52.380 --> 00:59:54.380]   So you're saying he's the girl in the relationship.
[00:59:54.380 --> 00:59:56.380]   What calls you are for a place?
[00:59:56.380 --> 00:59:57.380]   Oh, here we go again.
[00:59:57.380 --> 00:59:58.380]   What do you think now?
[00:59:58.380 --> 00:59:59.380]   Is Call of Duty?
[00:59:59.380 --> 01:00:00.380]   Did you get advanced warfare?
[01:00:00.380 --> 01:00:01.380]   Yes.
[01:00:01.380 --> 01:00:03.380]   Is it going downhill?
[01:00:03.380 --> 01:00:04.380]   It is.
[01:00:04.380 --> 01:00:06.500]   It's definitely going downhill, but I've been playing it for so long.
[01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:10.740]   I also, the new GTA 5 for Xbox One, I've been playing that too.
[01:00:10.740 --> 01:00:11.740]   That was fun.
[01:00:11.740 --> 01:00:12.740]   Yeah.
[01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:13.740]   That was fun.
[01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:14.740]   Because I love GTA.
[01:00:14.740 --> 01:00:16.740]   So I wish I had more time for video games, but I just don't.
[01:00:16.740 --> 01:00:24.180]   Apparently Call of Duty, Advanced Warfare Sales, have declined about 27% from Ghosts,
[01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:26.180]   which came out on 2013.
[01:00:26.180 --> 01:00:28.980]   Ghosts was down 19% from Black Ops 2.
[01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:32.020]   That was down 17% from Modern Warfare 3.
[01:00:32.020 --> 01:00:33.220]   And so on and on and on and on.
[01:00:33.220 --> 01:00:34.220]   I mean, it basically...
[01:00:34.220 --> 01:00:35.460]   They need to beef it up.
[01:00:35.460 --> 01:00:36.660]   Well, I think you...
[01:00:36.660 --> 01:00:39.620]   I mean, how many versions of Call of Duty are there?
[01:00:39.620 --> 01:00:41.020]   Yeah, there are a million of them.
[01:00:41.020 --> 01:00:43.340]   And the same thing, I like Assassin's Creed as well.
[01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:47.460]   The graphics in Assassin's Creed look fantastic, but the gameplay has been going downhill.
[01:00:47.460 --> 01:00:48.460]   It's not ever...
[01:00:48.460 --> 01:00:50.460]   It was never a good gameplay, but it's so beautiful.
[01:00:50.460 --> 01:00:52.460]   It's so beautiful to look at.
[01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:53.460]   Not butchery.
[01:00:53.460 --> 01:00:55.460]   You just a lot of climbing and running around.
[01:00:55.460 --> 01:00:56.460]   And abbutchery.
[01:00:56.460 --> 01:00:58.700]   And do you find new play Assassin's Creed on the PlayStation and Xbox?
[01:00:58.700 --> 01:00:59.700]   I do.
[01:00:59.700 --> 01:01:00.700]   And the Xbox.
[01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:01.700]   And the Xbox.
[01:01:01.700 --> 01:01:04.180]   For some reason, and this is not the Unity.
[01:01:04.180 --> 01:01:06.260]   This is the previous one.
[01:01:06.260 --> 01:01:07.260]   It's twitchy.
[01:01:07.260 --> 01:01:08.260]   I can't get the guy.
[01:01:08.260 --> 01:01:12.020]   I'm trying to run after the guy who stole my wallet.
[01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:15.500]   And I keep running past the turns and stuff because I get...
[01:01:15.500 --> 01:01:16.500]   Do you notice that's twitchy?
[01:01:16.500 --> 01:01:17.500]   I do.
[01:01:17.500 --> 01:01:18.500]   I do it is.
[01:01:18.500 --> 01:01:19.500]   It's twitchy.
[01:01:19.500 --> 01:01:20.500]   It's definitely twitchy.
[01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:21.500]   Get it every controller.
[01:01:21.500 --> 01:01:22.500]   Get it every controller.
[01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:23.500]   No, you can't.
[01:01:23.500 --> 01:01:24.500]   It's Xbox.
[01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:25.500]   There's nothing else.
[01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:26.500]   Exactly.
[01:01:26.500 --> 01:01:27.500]   There's nothing else.
[01:01:27.500 --> 01:01:28.500]   Although, I've been loving the Wii U lately with the Smash.
[01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:29.500]   No, you're playing Mario Smash Bros.
[01:01:29.500 --> 01:01:33.380]   Smash and Mario Kart Mario Kart was the greatest thing this summer.
[01:01:33.380 --> 01:01:34.740]   I had so much fun with Mario Kart.
[01:01:34.740 --> 01:01:35.740]   Is that the new one?
[01:01:35.740 --> 01:01:36.740]   Yeah, the new one.
[01:01:36.740 --> 01:01:38.180]   I haven't had that much fun with the video game.
[01:01:38.180 --> 01:01:43.860]   I'm being totally honest in probably a decade since Mario Kart this summer has so much fun
[01:01:43.860 --> 01:01:44.860]   with it on the Wii U.
[01:01:44.860 --> 01:01:48.180]   Okay, I was thinking of getting the Wii U for Michael.
[01:01:48.180 --> 01:01:49.180]   He's 12.
[01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:51.060]   Only because of Mario Kart 8.
[01:01:51.060 --> 01:01:52.060]   I just want him.
[01:01:52.060 --> 01:01:53.060]   He has more than one.
[01:01:53.060 --> 01:01:55.020]   I want to play Mario Kart 8.
[01:01:55.020 --> 01:01:56.940]   Yeah, Mario Kart 8.
[01:01:56.940 --> 01:01:58.460]   And the new Super Smash Brothers.
[01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:00.180]   I mean, they're so much fun.
[01:02:00.180 --> 01:02:03.460]   And it's one of those things where some of the other games are pretty good too, but just
[01:02:03.460 --> 01:02:05.780]   Mario Kart alone is such a blast.
[01:02:05.780 --> 01:02:07.380]   I mean, I had friends come over.
[01:02:07.380 --> 01:02:10.820]   I sold probably four Wii U's to people.
[01:02:10.820 --> 01:02:11.820]   Really?
[01:02:11.820 --> 01:02:14.220]   Yeah, just because they played Mario and they went, "Oh my God."
[01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:17.180]   People who aren't even huge video game people were like, "I have to have this."
[01:02:17.180 --> 01:02:19.980]   How much longer are they going to make this Wii U?
[01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:20.980]   Who even knows?
[01:02:20.980 --> 01:02:22.820]   They finally have good games.
[01:02:22.820 --> 01:02:27.660]   The problem is that the games play pretty well, but their interface is still really slow
[01:02:27.660 --> 01:02:29.420]   because they underpowered the thing.
[01:02:29.420 --> 01:02:30.860]   And it's not HD yet either.
[01:02:30.860 --> 01:02:31.860]   No, it's HD.
[01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:32.860]   Oh, it is HD.
[01:02:32.860 --> 01:02:33.860]   It's been that with the Wii U.
[01:02:33.860 --> 01:02:34.860]   It's finally HD.
[01:02:34.860 --> 01:02:35.860]   It's finally HD.
[01:02:35.860 --> 01:02:36.860]   What is it?
[01:02:36.860 --> 01:02:37.860]   4K.
[01:02:37.860 --> 01:02:38.860]   No.
[01:02:38.860 --> 01:02:39.860]   Yeah, I want 4K.
[01:02:39.860 --> 01:02:43.060]   Yeah, I need a 4K TV for that first.
[01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:44.620]   I'm not spent 10 grand on TV.
[01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:46.540]   I know they're actually pretty cheap.
[01:02:46.540 --> 01:02:47.540]   You can get them now at Costco.
[01:02:47.540 --> 01:02:48.540]   I know they're crappy ones.
[01:02:48.540 --> 01:02:49.540]   I know.
[01:02:49.540 --> 01:02:50.540]   They're crappy.
[01:02:50.540 --> 01:02:51.540]   And don't get them because...
[01:02:51.540 --> 01:02:52.540]   Don't get them because they're the real one.
[01:02:52.540 --> 01:02:53.540]   I'm not gonna lie, dude.
[01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:56.060]   Don't get UHD now because the standard's not set and you're going to get a TV that's not
[01:02:56.060 --> 01:02:57.060]   going to take advantage of...
[01:02:57.060 --> 01:03:00.740]   Every new set that comes out, you should never buy any of them.
[01:03:00.740 --> 01:03:05.020]   Well, when the UHD standard is set and the color space and all of that stuff, then get
[01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:06.020]   one.
[01:03:06.020 --> 01:03:07.660]   But don't buy one now.
[01:03:07.660 --> 01:03:10.820]   And when's the new Blu-ray standard is out so that they're going to drag you?
[01:03:10.820 --> 01:03:11.820]   Exactly.
[01:03:11.820 --> 01:03:12.820]   Well, let me think.
[01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:15.020]   Leo, do you have a 4K TV?
[01:03:15.020 --> 01:03:17.860]   No, I have a OLED.
[01:03:17.860 --> 01:03:18.860]   That's OLED.
[01:03:18.860 --> 01:03:19.860]   I thought you had a 4K.
[01:03:19.860 --> 01:03:20.860]   So is that curved one you see?
[01:03:20.860 --> 01:03:22.460]   That's because the OLED looks so good.
[01:03:22.460 --> 01:03:23.460]   That's good.
[01:03:23.460 --> 01:03:24.460]   So good.
[01:03:24.460 --> 01:03:27.260]   I think the Wii U on my OLED TV would be very nice.
[01:03:27.260 --> 01:03:28.740]   Oh, it'll look amazing.
[01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:30.940]   Mario Kart will have so much fun.
[01:03:30.940 --> 01:03:35.220]   We have to throw shells and Luigi gives the stink eye.
[01:03:35.220 --> 01:03:37.220]   It's just the greatest thing ever.
[01:03:37.220 --> 01:03:42.180]   Okay, now the Wii U is a controller with a screen in the controller.
[01:03:42.180 --> 01:03:43.180]   It does.
[01:03:43.180 --> 01:03:44.180]   It has one of those.
[01:03:44.180 --> 01:03:45.180]   You don't have to use that though.
[01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:46.180]   It also has.
[01:03:46.180 --> 01:03:47.340]   You can use regular controllers with it.
[01:03:47.340 --> 01:03:49.620]   You can use either any of the Wii accessories.
[01:03:49.620 --> 01:03:51.660]   You can even use the GameCube controllers with it.
[01:03:51.660 --> 01:03:53.460]   I can get the last steering wheel and do it.
[01:03:53.460 --> 01:03:55.460]   The steering wheel works really well.
[01:03:55.460 --> 01:03:56.660]   Is that what you use, Christine?
[01:03:56.660 --> 01:03:58.660]   Yeah, I use the steering wheel.
[01:03:58.660 --> 01:04:03.300]   And it's pretty clean.
[01:04:03.300 --> 01:04:04.300]   It's so much fun.
[01:04:04.300 --> 01:04:06.620]   I mean, my husband's a big force person.
[01:04:06.620 --> 01:04:09.740]   So he really loves force and then I'm in tomorrow.
[01:04:09.740 --> 01:04:11.100]   I'm like, I don't want the realism.
[01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:12.420]   I just want the car racing.
[01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:13.620]   I drive every day.
[01:04:13.620 --> 01:04:15.460]   I don't need a car game.
[01:04:15.460 --> 01:04:16.460]   I don't need a...
[01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:20.180]   But I have to say, I could see myself if I play enough of this Mario Kart that having
[01:04:20.180 --> 01:04:23.900]   a dream that I'm driving around in a Mario Kart.
[01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:25.740]   That's what happens to GTA.
[01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:29.340]   I can see you having the dream for sure.
[01:04:29.340 --> 01:04:33.100]   So what GTA, what happens is that I walk around New York City or I walk around something else
[01:04:33.100 --> 01:04:37.140]   and I see a car, I see like a mess like or something.
[01:04:37.140 --> 01:04:38.140]   Exactly.
[01:04:38.140 --> 01:04:41.180]   And my first instinct is to jump in the car and start driving off and I have to stop myself
[01:04:41.180 --> 01:04:42.820]   and go, no, no, no, no, no.
[01:04:42.820 --> 01:04:43.820]   This isn't a game.
[01:04:43.820 --> 01:04:44.820]   This is real life.
[01:04:44.820 --> 01:04:46.580]   You don't actually steal cars now.
[01:04:46.580 --> 01:04:47.580]   So that's that's that's it.
[01:04:47.580 --> 01:04:48.580]   Okay.
[01:04:48.580 --> 01:04:49.980]   I can see what she does to others.
[01:04:49.980 --> 01:04:50.980]   Holy mackerel.
[01:04:50.980 --> 01:04:51.980]   Holy mackerel.
[01:04:51.980 --> 01:04:52.980]   You should especially be very happy.
[01:04:52.980 --> 01:04:53.980]   Now we know.
[01:04:53.980 --> 01:04:54.980]   Yeah.
[01:04:54.980 --> 01:04:55.980]   No, no, that's only in Jersey.
[01:04:55.980 --> 01:04:56.980]   That's only in Jersey.
[01:04:56.980 --> 01:04:57.980]   Should I get GTA 5?
[01:04:57.980 --> 01:04:58.980]   Should I?
[01:04:58.980 --> 01:04:59.980]   Yes.
[01:04:59.980 --> 01:05:00.980]   He should.
[01:05:00.980 --> 01:05:01.980]   Fantastic.
[01:05:01.980 --> 01:05:03.780]   I, you know, my son played the games and I thought this is wrong.
[01:05:03.780 --> 01:05:04.780]   But he also...
[01:05:04.780 --> 01:05:05.780]   He had to go wrong with the game.
[01:05:05.780 --> 01:05:07.940]   You know when he played that was even worse was postal.
[01:05:07.940 --> 01:05:08.940]   Do you remember that?
[01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:09.940]   Yes.
[01:05:09.940 --> 01:05:10.940]   I remember.
[01:05:10.940 --> 01:05:11.940]   I was a old school.
[01:05:11.940 --> 01:05:13.380]   That was a horrible game.
[01:05:13.380 --> 01:05:15.380]   You'd rip people's heads off and...
[01:05:15.380 --> 01:05:17.380]   That was bad in Europe.
[01:05:17.380 --> 01:05:18.380]   Yeah.
[01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:19.380]   I know.
[01:05:19.380 --> 01:05:20.380]   I should have been failing.
[01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:22.660]   Is there any more news we can talk about?
[01:05:22.660 --> 01:05:23.660]   Not at all.
[01:05:23.660 --> 01:05:26.860]   So let's tell you what in case you just tuned in but you still have to pee?
[01:05:26.860 --> 01:05:27.860]   Let's take a look at...
[01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:29.220]   Another pee break?
[01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:30.580]   Let's take a look at what's...
[01:05:30.580 --> 01:05:32.460]   This was a good week on Twitch.
[01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:36.460]   Let's take a little look while the Niners lose at what happened this week on Twitch.
[01:05:36.460 --> 01:05:38.260]   Previously on Twitch.
[01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:39.700]   That newsroom thing was pretty cool, huh?
[01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:40.700]   Yeah, it was neat.
[01:05:40.700 --> 01:05:43.020]   He's obviously logged into the Twitch live IRC.
[01:05:43.020 --> 01:05:45.820]   He's like, please let it be on that end.
[01:05:45.820 --> 01:05:47.060]   Security now.
[01:05:47.060 --> 01:05:50.820]   How many breaches of Sony have we talked about in the past?
[01:05:50.820 --> 01:05:56.780]   BitTorrent clients have been loaded on Sony's servers then they're offering the torrents
[01:05:56.780 --> 01:05:58.740]   from Sony's own servers.
[01:05:58.740 --> 01:06:01.020]   That's insult to injury.
[01:06:01.020 --> 01:06:02.020]   Triangulation.
[01:06:02.020 --> 01:06:06.700]   Or in Jacob's here he's CEO, founder of toytalktoytalk.com.
[01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:08.660]   I am not a pet.
[01:06:08.660 --> 01:06:10.780]   Because I thought you were a cute little puppy.
[01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:14.500]   Yeah, because you have two arms and two legs and two eyes.
[01:06:14.500 --> 01:06:15.500]   Tech news tonight.
[01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:20.060]   It's 85 of the most disruptive ideas in our history.
[01:06:20.060 --> 01:06:23.380]   My favorite is PowerPoint at number 53.
[01:06:23.380 --> 01:06:28.820]   Destructions aren't all good things, but it really has changed the way that many companies
[01:06:28.820 --> 01:06:29.820]   do business.
[01:06:29.820 --> 01:06:30.820]   Twitch.
[01:06:30.820 --> 01:06:32.620]   It's free when you watch from work.
[01:06:32.620 --> 01:06:37.300]   You know, the smartphone is number 78, but I will point out that kitty litter is number
[01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:38.300]   73.
[01:06:38.300 --> 01:06:40.540]   I'm gonna go ahead and take that right there.
[01:06:40.540 --> 01:06:44.860]   Kitty litter is absolutely one of the best inventions of the century.
[01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:51.620]   Do we have a week ahead with Mr. Mike Elgin, news director here at the Twit Complex?
[01:06:51.620 --> 01:06:52.620]   Let's hear it.
[01:06:52.620 --> 01:06:56.180]   Coming up this week, Oracle reports earnings on Wednesday, December 17th.
[01:06:56.180 --> 01:07:00.140]   Also on Wednesday, the Chinese search giant Baidu is expected to announce a major investment
[01:07:00.140 --> 01:07:05.340]   in Uber and Blackberry has an earnings call scheduled for Friday, December 19th.
[01:07:05.340 --> 01:07:06.340]   That's what's coming up this week.
[01:07:06.340 --> 01:07:07.740]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:07:07.740 --> 01:07:08.740]   Thank you, Mike.
[01:07:08.740 --> 01:07:09.740]   Mr. Mike.
[01:07:09.740 --> 01:07:10.740]   Thank you, Mikey.
[01:07:10.740 --> 01:07:12.060]   Thank you, Mr. Mike Elgin, news director.
[01:07:12.060 --> 01:07:14.060]   You can catch, of course, this week.
[01:07:14.060 --> 01:07:21.500]   TNT, I should say, Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. Pacific, 1 p.m. Eastern time, 1800 UTC.
[01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:23.460]   Your daily dose of techno.
[01:07:23.460 --> 01:07:24.460]   Should I worry?
[01:07:24.460 --> 01:07:25.460]   Yes.
[01:07:25.460 --> 01:07:31.740]   I rooted my Nexus 6 phone and then looked at it with a file manager and I found a folder
[01:07:31.740 --> 01:07:33.540]   called Baidu.
[01:07:33.540 --> 01:07:34.540]   Baidu.
[01:07:34.540 --> 01:07:35.540]   Baidu, the Chinese...
[01:07:35.540 --> 01:07:37.580]   So you feel you should worry?
[01:07:37.580 --> 01:07:41.460]   I don't think that I should have a folder named Baidu on a phone that I never had a
[01:07:41.460 --> 01:07:42.940]   Baidu program on.
[01:07:42.940 --> 01:07:44.940]   Maybe something is up.
[01:07:44.940 --> 01:07:45.940]   Where is it?
[01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:46.940]   Where is this?
[01:07:46.940 --> 01:07:47.940]   Is this the name of who's phone is?
[01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:48.940]   This is the Nexus 6.
[01:07:48.940 --> 01:07:50.780]   It's made by Motorola, but it is made in China.
[01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:53.820]   And where did you get the image that you used to root the phone?
[01:07:53.820 --> 01:07:57.060]   Oh, you got it from Baidu.
[01:07:57.060 --> 01:08:00.620]   Oh, I'm in trouble now.
[01:08:00.620 --> 01:08:02.540]   I just found it on the internet.
[01:08:02.540 --> 01:08:04.260]   I just found it on the internet.
[01:08:04.260 --> 01:08:05.740]   Just any old image.
[01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:06.740]   Just x, just there it was.
[01:08:06.740 --> 01:08:08.300]   I found it on the internet.
[01:08:08.300 --> 01:08:09.700]   I'm going to root my phone.
[01:08:09.700 --> 01:08:12.020]   What could possibly go wrong?
[01:08:12.020 --> 01:08:13.860]   This thing is huge.
[01:08:13.860 --> 01:08:14.860]   It's the Nexus 6.
[01:08:14.860 --> 01:08:15.860]   It is too big.
[01:08:15.860 --> 01:08:17.860]   You know the code name was Shamu.
[01:08:17.860 --> 01:08:18.860]   It's too big.
[01:08:18.860 --> 01:08:19.860]   Yeah, I can see your whale.
[01:08:19.860 --> 01:08:20.860]   I know it's just right.
[01:08:20.860 --> 01:08:22.580]   It's also weighs a ton.
[01:08:22.580 --> 01:08:23.580]   Well, it's big.
[01:08:23.580 --> 01:08:25.900]   So I have one of those phony iPhone 6s from China.
[01:08:25.900 --> 01:08:26.900]   Those are good.
[01:08:26.900 --> 01:08:27.900]   You got one of those.
[01:08:27.900 --> 01:08:28.900]   Yeah.
[01:08:28.900 --> 01:08:30.420]   Oh, I have something else for you that Char Bax brought me.
[01:08:30.420 --> 01:08:31.420]   Okay.
[01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:32.420]   A little keyboard that folds out.
[01:08:32.420 --> 01:08:33.420]   He said, "Get this to divorce."
[01:08:33.420 --> 01:08:34.420]   Oh, okay.
[01:08:34.420 --> 01:08:35.420]   I would, but you didn't give me my camera back, so...
[01:08:35.420 --> 01:08:36.740]   Oh, you can keep it then.
[01:08:36.740 --> 01:08:37.740]   Keep the camera.
[01:08:37.740 --> 01:08:38.740]   Wait a minute.
[01:08:38.740 --> 01:08:42.060]   No, I got the camera anytime you want it.
[01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:45.540]   I've kept everything in the little pack, so I'm not like the lenses aren't floating
[01:08:45.540 --> 01:08:46.540]   around the house.
[01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:50.740]   Did anybody go buy anything for Black Friday?
[01:08:50.740 --> 01:08:52.980]   Any of you could do your Black Friday?
[01:08:52.980 --> 01:08:53.980]   Here's the...
[01:08:53.980 --> 01:08:54.980]   Thank you.
[01:08:54.980 --> 01:08:55.980]   Here's the keyboard.
[01:08:55.980 --> 01:08:56.980]   Yeah.
[01:08:56.980 --> 01:08:57.980]   It's kind of cute.
[01:08:57.980 --> 01:09:00.180]   No, most of the deals you get on Black Friday ain't really good deals.
[01:09:00.180 --> 01:09:01.580]   You knew that, did you?
[01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:02.580]   I did know that.
[01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:04.020]   I wanted to stay away from it.
[01:09:04.020 --> 01:09:16.220]   The folks at the wire cutter took us, did a survey of 54,000, 54,000 of the deals for
[01:09:16.220 --> 01:09:18.100]   Black Friday.
[01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:22.580]   Of those 54,000, how many do you think actually were deals?
[01:09:22.580 --> 01:09:23.580]   None.
[01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:24.580]   Two.
[01:09:24.580 --> 01:09:25.580]   Three hundred.
[01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:26.580]   Less than one.
[01:09:26.580 --> 01:09:27.580]   Well, still a...
[01:09:27.580 --> 01:09:28.580]   300 out of 54,000.
[01:09:28.580 --> 01:09:30.780]   Well, that's a scam.
[01:09:30.780 --> 01:09:35.500]   One of the things they found, maybe in fact I even saw this, I think it was best by was
[01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:36.500]   offering a...
[01:09:36.500 --> 01:09:39.900]   Was it a Samsung UHD Ultra HD TV?
[01:09:39.900 --> 01:09:42.340]   Let me see if I can find the story here.
[01:09:42.340 --> 01:09:43.340]   Yeah.
[01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:48.300]   55 inch Ultra High Definition Samsung TV, 899 on Black Friday.
[01:09:48.300 --> 01:09:51.340]   Discounted $500.
[01:09:51.340 --> 01:09:54.460]   Best Buy in fact has raised the price back up to $12.99.
[01:09:54.460 --> 01:09:56.780]   But the wire cutter looked at the model.
[01:09:56.780 --> 01:10:02.700]   They found it had one of the worst cases of motion blur they've ever seen in an LCD.
[01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:07.180]   The 4K resolution only holds true if there is no motion on the screen at all.
[01:10:07.180 --> 01:10:14.020]   If it's a static picture, they said on a moving image you'd be lucky to get 1K.
[01:10:14.020 --> 01:10:15.020]   What brand is this?
[01:10:15.020 --> 01:10:16.020]   It's not even HD.
[01:10:16.020 --> 01:10:17.020]   Samsung.
[01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:18.420]   Huh.
[01:10:18.420 --> 01:10:23.140]   And that's the problem is yes, there may be deals but they will not be on the best items.
[01:10:23.140 --> 01:10:28.140]   In fact, Brian Lamb who started the wire cutter, we love Brian, said don't get distracted
[01:10:28.140 --> 01:10:31.620]   by the razzle dazzle of double digit off.
[01:10:31.620 --> 01:10:33.900]   Figure out what you need then do the math.
[01:10:33.900 --> 01:10:39.500]   He said otherwise you'll get lost in a sea of apparent discounts that are most likely
[01:10:39.500 --> 01:10:42.300]   not good things and not good prices.
[01:10:42.300 --> 01:10:44.780]   They're not good things and they're not good prices.
[01:10:44.780 --> 01:10:49.220]   He said the best stuff, the stuff that's really good is almost never on sale.
[01:10:49.220 --> 01:10:53.100]   In that story that Farhad Manju wrote, he mentioned the site.
[01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:55.100]   I'd never heard of before and I went and checked it out.
[01:10:55.100 --> 01:11:00.180]   It's pretty interesting called Camel Camel Camel Camel Camel Camel Camel Camel Camel.
[01:11:00.180 --> 01:11:07.060]   And this site tracks Amazon products and you can set up essentially alerts to let you
[01:11:07.060 --> 01:11:10.180]   know when something is hit a certain low price.
[01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:15.220]   And they also have separate sites for Best Buy and Newegg that tracks those websites
[01:11:15.220 --> 01:11:16.220]   as well.
[01:11:16.220 --> 01:11:17.220]   I didn't know about that.
[01:11:17.220 --> 01:11:21.020]   I didn't either and I bookmarked it because this is such a great thing.
[01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:24.100]   This is Amazon price history for one of the things they were talking about.
[01:11:24.100 --> 01:11:25.460]   In fact I have this toaster oven.
[01:11:25.460 --> 01:11:26.820]   They say it's a very good toaster oven.
[01:11:26.820 --> 01:11:28.740]   The Breville Smart Oven.
[01:11:28.740 --> 01:11:36.620]   And you can see the graph price history graph went down as low as $187 and as high as $250.
[01:11:36.620 --> 01:11:42.140]   And so that really tells you that what the range is and when you go to Macy's and they're
[01:11:42.140 --> 01:11:45.460]   Black Friday deal and it's $300, that's not a good deal.
[01:11:45.460 --> 01:11:46.460]   Right.
[01:11:46.460 --> 01:11:48.420]   You know, I don't think that this is news.
[01:11:48.420 --> 01:11:50.340]   I think it is.
[01:11:50.340 --> 01:11:55.500]   I think people do think that we talked about, you know, the door buster specials and Black
[01:11:55.500 --> 01:11:58.140]   Friday and stuff on Twitch a couple of weeks ago.
[01:11:58.140 --> 01:11:59.140]   A couple of weeks ago.
[01:11:59.140 --> 01:12:01.220]   And was it, it might have been Owen.
[01:12:01.220 --> 01:12:03.820]   I can't remember who it was, but somebody said, look, you're not poor.
[01:12:03.820 --> 01:12:07.940]   You don't understand that if you don't have a lot of money and you need to get gifts,
[01:12:07.940 --> 01:12:11.540]   you're going to get in line on these doorbusters because you're going to be able to get more
[01:12:11.540 --> 01:12:12.780]   for your money.
[01:12:12.780 --> 01:12:15.620]   And I think a lot of people do believe they're getting a better deal.
[01:12:15.620 --> 01:12:17.660]   It is not a good deal.
[01:12:17.660 --> 01:12:19.100]   And you are not often saving money.
[01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:25.540]   For instance, they, this smart toaster Macy's was offering for a limited time sale price.
[01:12:25.540 --> 01:12:31.460]   You just saw that the highest price on Amazon was $250 Macy's was offering for $280.
[01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:39.740]   Oh, no, which Macy says is that discount off the items regular price of $417 except
[01:12:39.740 --> 01:12:43.780]   according to camel, camel, camel.
[01:12:43.780 --> 01:12:45.500]   No one's ever charged that.
[01:12:45.500 --> 01:12:53.900]   So, Farhad asked a spokeswoman for Macy's, where did that $4 to $17 price come from?
[01:12:53.900 --> 01:12:58.900]   Macy says, those quote regular prices are based on many different factors, including the
[01:12:58.900 --> 01:12:59.900]   cost.
[01:12:59.900 --> 01:13:07.620]   Including the cost of the item overhead benefits we offer as well as our ability to offer the
[01:13:07.620 --> 01:13:11.580]   item at a lower price during sales events.
[01:13:11.580 --> 01:13:12.580]   Gambling?
[01:13:12.580 --> 01:13:15.260]   I'm stunned.
[01:13:15.260 --> 01:13:16.260]   Because Macy's...
[01:13:16.260 --> 01:13:19.940]   It's like how TJ Maxx always says, compared to up to whatever the price is, and you're
[01:13:19.940 --> 01:13:22.860]   like, yeah, this shirt never sold for that much money because they can't make it to
[01:13:22.860 --> 01:13:24.500]   Maxx for making me think about it.
[01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:26.060]   She says, "Sondishing news."
[01:13:26.060 --> 01:13:27.060]   Oh, come on.
[01:13:27.060 --> 01:13:31.940]   Macy's explains in the fine print on its website that regular prices may never have resulted
[01:13:31.940 --> 01:13:34.940]   in any actual sales.
[01:13:34.940 --> 01:13:40.700]   When I mean, granted this was more than a decade ago, but when I worked at Best Buy
[01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:42.500]   when I was in high school and college for a buy-for-a-get.
[01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:44.820]   Were you one to geek squad?
[01:13:44.820 --> 01:13:49.860]   I quit when it became geek squad because they wanted me to wear polyester pants and shirt
[01:13:49.860 --> 01:13:52.420]   combo that was attached together with a clip on tie.
[01:13:52.420 --> 01:13:54.940]   At that point, I was like, "No, I'm done.
[01:13:54.940 --> 01:13:55.940]   I'm not doing this."
[01:13:55.940 --> 01:13:56.940]   I like to clip on tie.
[01:13:56.940 --> 01:13:59.740]   I'm not going to wear a clip on tie in polyester.
[01:13:59.740 --> 01:14:01.900]   Christina Warren, I like your high standards.
[01:14:01.900 --> 01:14:05.460]   I will work for the East Buy, but I will not wear polyester pants.
[01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:08.180]   That was basically who it was at.
[01:14:08.180 --> 01:14:09.180]   You know what?
[01:14:09.180 --> 01:14:12.420]   At that point, the company had taken five years of my life, my youth, everything.
[01:14:12.420 --> 01:14:15.420]   You know what?
[01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:17.420]   You sucked me dry.
[01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:18.420]   Best Buy.
[01:14:18.420 --> 01:14:20.420]   I'm gone.
[01:14:20.420 --> 01:14:22.620]   That basically was it.
[01:14:22.620 --> 01:14:26.620]   What was funny was that for Black Friday and for other things, we would actually get,
[01:14:26.620 --> 01:14:27.620]   remember e-machines?
[01:14:27.620 --> 01:14:30.620]   Remember those of the really terrible computers?
[01:14:30.620 --> 01:14:33.980]   We would get special e-machines and we would only sell on Black Friday when we get these
[01:14:33.980 --> 01:14:39.740]   packages that were similarly specced but not quite as good as the regular low-cost
[01:14:39.740 --> 01:14:40.740]   machines.
[01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:42.340]   We would get things from HP as well.
[01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:43.340]   We'd get computers.
[01:14:43.340 --> 01:14:47.020]   We would only sell at Black Friday that we would have for these really low prices but
[01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:49.740]   have these kind of cut down configurations.
[01:14:49.740 --> 01:14:53.420]   They would look really similar in model number to the existing stuff we sold but they weren't
[01:14:53.420 --> 01:14:57.140]   exactly the same and they were $100 less or whatever.
[01:14:57.140 --> 01:15:01.660]   We'd sell out of all of those and then we'd have to try to upsell people to the real ones
[01:15:01.660 --> 01:15:04.260]   that were sort of similar to what was in the ad.
[01:15:04.260 --> 01:15:09.220]   The fact of the batteries is, but that just proves that this report is totally right.
[01:15:09.220 --> 01:15:13.060]   It's that a lot of these things are not deals and the good stuff doesn't go on sale and
[01:15:13.060 --> 01:15:16.580]   in fact they get models of products in just a sell.
[01:15:16.580 --> 01:15:17.580]   That's interesting.
[01:15:17.580 --> 01:15:18.580]   Yeah.
[01:15:18.580 --> 01:15:19.580]   You're not even legit.
[01:15:19.580 --> 01:15:21.580]   You're right, John.
[01:15:21.580 --> 01:15:22.580]   I did.
[01:15:22.580 --> 01:15:23.580]   I owe it.
[01:15:23.580 --> 01:15:24.940]   What are you looking at grains for?
[01:15:24.940 --> 01:15:26.500]   I just thought I put this up on this.
[01:15:26.500 --> 01:15:27.500]   It's nuts.
[01:15:27.500 --> 01:15:31.220]   You just did a third for nuts.
[01:15:31.220 --> 01:15:36.660]   Of course, people kind of, but did you, I mean, the actual depth of this.
[01:15:36.660 --> 01:15:40.940]   Out of 54,000 products, only 300 or anywhere.
[01:15:40.940 --> 01:15:42.460]   I was surprised it was that high.
[01:15:42.460 --> 01:15:43.460]   It was stunned.
[01:15:43.460 --> 01:15:44.460]   You thought it was zero.
[01:15:44.460 --> 01:15:45.460]   Yes.
[01:15:45.460 --> 01:15:46.460]   I'm sorry.
[01:15:46.460 --> 01:15:47.460]   Do I go?
[01:15:47.460 --> 01:15:50.860]   You know, what I would like to see the camel camel camel is so good and both wire cutter
[01:15:50.860 --> 01:15:53.180]   and sweet home are such good resources.
[01:15:53.180 --> 01:15:59.100]   I'd love to see them combined or where say wire cutter were to buy camel camel.
[01:15:59.100 --> 01:16:04.380]   Can you imagine that type of tracking built into a site like wire cutter?
[01:16:04.380 --> 01:16:05.380]   That would be amazing.
[01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:11.580]   Actually, you know, Brian started wire cutter after he left Gizmodo and I think it was
[01:16:11.580 --> 01:16:13.820]   almost just a personal pet project.
[01:16:13.820 --> 01:16:14.820]   Right.
[01:16:14.820 --> 01:16:18.660]   It was just his recommendation because he felt like, you know, when you see these reviews
[01:16:18.660 --> 01:16:23.580]   is what you really want to know is in this category, what's the one product?
[01:16:23.580 --> 01:16:24.580]   What's the best product?
[01:16:24.580 --> 01:16:27.540]   So, where kind of was just like, don't worry about this is the best one.
[01:16:27.540 --> 01:16:29.060]   This is the best toast driven.
[01:16:29.060 --> 01:16:30.300]   This is the best electric room.
[01:16:30.300 --> 01:16:31.660]   This is the best computer.
[01:16:31.660 --> 01:16:32.660]   That's the one.
[01:16:32.660 --> 01:16:35.580]   And I almost always agreed with their conclusions.
[01:16:35.580 --> 01:16:40.900]   And obviously it's been a it was a great idea because they're clearly growing and good on
[01:16:40.900 --> 01:16:41.900]   him.
[01:16:41.900 --> 01:16:42.900]   I think that's great.
[01:16:42.900 --> 01:16:46.980]   Although the sweet home has some strange categories like I saw today that they have
[01:16:46.980 --> 01:16:49.940]   the best facial tissues and their puffs.
[01:16:49.940 --> 01:16:54.780]   Actually, there's a brand in Canada that's far superior to puffs.
[01:16:54.780 --> 01:16:55.780]   I'm serious.
[01:16:55.780 --> 01:16:58.820]   You think I joke?
[01:16:58.820 --> 01:16:59.820]   It's nuts.
[01:16:59.820 --> 01:17:09.700]   I love it how, you know, John is somehow commenting on the show by searching images on Google.
[01:17:09.700 --> 01:17:12.820]   And you just like felt like searching for nuts and you pulled up nuts.
[01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:13.820]   Yes, there's a bunch of it.
[01:17:13.820 --> 01:17:16.540]   And now curiously you did the same exact thing.
[01:17:16.540 --> 01:17:17.900]   Well, because nobody could see your screen.
[01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:19.900]   So I thought I'd show them what John's looking at.
[01:17:19.900 --> 01:17:20.900]   Yes.
[01:17:20.900 --> 01:17:22.380]   Did that make you feel better doing that?
[01:17:22.380 --> 01:17:24.260]   I like the nuts heart.
[01:17:24.260 --> 01:17:25.260]   I think that's up there.
[01:17:25.260 --> 01:17:26.660]   Tasty looking.
[01:17:26.660 --> 01:17:29.100]   Too many almonds.
[01:17:29.100 --> 01:17:32.980]   And they also will say and bolts, peanuts, squirrel.
[01:17:32.980 --> 01:17:37.740]   And in fact, this is my favorite picture.
[01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:38.740]   What nuts?
[01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:39.740]   Yes, this one.
[01:17:39.740 --> 01:17:40.740]   No, don't show that one.
[01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:42.140]   We're going to take a break.
[01:17:42.140 --> 01:17:43.140]   Come back with more.
[01:17:43.140 --> 01:17:48.220]   John C. Dvorak is here from knowajannahshow.com Christina Warren from Mashable and Dwight
[01:17:48.220 --> 01:17:50.700]   Silverman from the Houston Chronicle.
[01:17:50.700 --> 01:17:52.860]   Our show today brought to you by stamps.com.
[01:17:52.860 --> 01:17:54.020]   We just mailed our Christmas cards.
[01:17:54.020 --> 01:17:55.820]   You think we went to the post office to buy stamps.
[01:17:55.820 --> 01:17:56.820]   What are you nuts?
[01:17:56.820 --> 01:17:57.820]   Nuts.
[01:17:57.820 --> 01:17:58.820]   Nuts.
[01:17:58.820 --> 01:18:00.620]   Who has time to go to the post office?
[01:18:00.620 --> 01:18:02.220]   This time of year, it's crowded.
[01:18:02.220 --> 01:18:03.860]   There's parking hassles.
[01:18:03.860 --> 01:18:05.260]   There's traffic.
[01:18:05.260 --> 01:18:08.100]   Just driving across town this time of year is nuts.
[01:18:08.100 --> 01:18:09.420]   So we use stamps.com.
[01:18:09.420 --> 01:18:14.620]   Stamps.com lets us buy and print our own US postage from our computer, from our printer.
[01:18:14.620 --> 01:18:17.860]   You know, I don't ever have to get up in the desk.
[01:18:17.860 --> 01:18:21.940]   And you could print postage for any letter or package when you need it.
[01:18:21.940 --> 01:18:23.780]   You always have exactly the right price.
[01:18:23.780 --> 01:18:25.300]   You don't have to worry.
[01:18:25.300 --> 01:18:26.300]   And the mailman picks it up.
[01:18:26.300 --> 01:18:27.300]   It's easy.
[01:18:27.300 --> 01:18:28.460]   It's convenient with their USB scale.
[01:18:28.460 --> 01:18:29.900]   You never have to guess.
[01:18:29.900 --> 01:18:33.740]   You get discounts you can't even get at the post office of Priority Mail.
[01:18:33.740 --> 01:18:36.080]   Priority Mail Express shipments.
[01:18:36.080 --> 01:18:40.020]   If you're doing international mailing, you'll automatically fill out the customs forms.
[01:18:40.020 --> 01:18:47.780]   And in fact, it saves you on errors because if you sell on eBay, Amazon, Etsy, if you use
[01:18:47.780 --> 01:18:52.780]   QuickBooks, it will pull the information, the addresses right from those websites or
[01:18:52.780 --> 01:18:56.460]   those services to fill it out automatically.
[01:18:56.460 --> 01:18:58.180]   It is so fast.
[01:18:58.180 --> 01:19:00.180]   This is mailing made professional.
[01:19:00.180 --> 01:19:02.660]   You can even print right on the envelope, which is awesome.
[01:19:02.660 --> 01:19:06.820]   With your company logo, the return address pre-populated, it'll save you time.
[01:19:06.820 --> 01:19:08.180]   It'll save you money.
[01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:09.180]   You're going to love it.
[01:19:09.180 --> 01:19:12.100]   And I have a special deal that is really second to none.
[01:19:12.100 --> 01:19:15.020]   This is the time of year to take advantage of our no risk trial.

[01:19:28.900 --> 01:19:31.740]   You just pay shipping and handling for that five bucks.
[01:19:31.740 --> 01:19:36.100]   But it also gives you $55 in free postage coupons to use over the first few months of
[01:19:36.100 --> 01:19:39.100]   your account and 30 days free of stamps.com.

[01:19:58.460 --> 01:20:03.660]   So I'm watching with great interest, a couple of Supreme Court cases.
[01:20:03.660 --> 01:20:08.300]   One that I'm really interested in is about free speech.
[01:20:08.300 --> 01:20:09.300]   Yeah.
[01:20:09.300 --> 01:20:14.020]   Let me see if I can find this story because I don't think it's in our rundown.
[01:20:14.020 --> 01:20:15.700]   The first amendment.
[01:20:15.700 --> 01:20:22.700]   And the question is, believe it or not, if the first amendment protects hate speech online,
[01:20:22.700 --> 01:20:34.260]   let me see if I can find this story.
[01:20:34.260 --> 01:20:37.700]   It comes from a guy who was harassing his ex-wife on Facebook.
[01:20:37.700 --> 01:20:39.860]   And I mean, this is the crazy guy.
[01:20:39.860 --> 01:20:40.860]   Right.
[01:20:40.860 --> 01:20:41.860]   He's a jail right now.
[01:20:41.860 --> 01:20:45.300]   And I'm just joking.
[01:20:45.300 --> 01:20:48.180]   He had all these crazy things.
[01:20:48.180 --> 01:20:55.020]   So they actually heard arguments December 1st.
[01:20:55.020 --> 01:20:59.980]   A Pennsylvania resident Anthony Alonas was sent us to four years in prison for posting
[01:20:59.980 --> 01:21:06.180]   explicit rap lyrics in which he threatened to murder his estranged wife, shoot up elementary
[01:21:06.180 --> 01:21:11.820]   schools, and cut the throat of an FBI agent investigating the case.
[01:21:11.820 --> 01:21:19.660]   He went to jail for that because it's a federal offense to transmit threats over the internet,
[01:21:19.660 --> 01:21:24.740]   interstate threats to injure the person, the person of another.
[01:21:24.740 --> 01:21:27.820]   One of the things he wrote, "I'm not going to rest until your body is a mess soaked in
[01:21:27.820 --> 01:21:29.380]   blood and dying from all the little cuts.
[01:21:29.380 --> 01:21:31.860]   Hurry up and die."
[01:21:31.860 --> 01:21:36.180]   Seems like that's not protected by free speech, right?
[01:21:36.180 --> 01:21:40.060]   And in the past, it's always been held that if-
[01:21:40.060 --> 01:21:41.780]   This is really not hate speech.
[01:21:41.780 --> 01:21:46.100]   Well, but free speech is not protected if it's a threat against somebody.
[01:21:46.100 --> 01:21:50.860]   It's a threat speech.
[01:21:50.860 --> 01:21:58.180]   The ACLU is defending this guy, bless their hearts, saying, "A statute that pro-scribes
[01:21:58.180 --> 01:22:03.340]   speech without regard to the speaker's intended meaning runs the risk of punishing protected
[01:22:03.340 --> 01:22:10.460]   First Amendment expression simply because it is crudely or zealously expressed."
[01:22:10.460 --> 01:22:15.140]   Supreme Court has all along said that if it's a true threat, it's not protected under the
[01:22:15.140 --> 01:22:18.260]   First Amendment.
[01:22:18.260 --> 01:22:20.300]   But they are agreeing to hear this case.
[01:22:20.300 --> 01:22:22.260]   This is a true threat.
[01:22:22.260 --> 01:22:23.900]   Sounds like a threat.
[01:22:23.900 --> 01:22:24.900]   Sounds like a threat.
[01:22:24.900 --> 01:22:25.900]   It's a threat.
[01:22:25.900 --> 01:22:28.220]   She, his ex, filed a restraining order.
[01:22:28.220 --> 01:22:31.980]   She feared for her life.
[01:22:31.980 --> 01:22:33.860]   The appeals court said, "No, no, you're right.
[01:22:33.860 --> 01:22:38.260]   They sent him to jail," saying the federal statute only requires a reasonable person
[01:22:38.260 --> 01:22:41.500]   would feel legitimately threatened.
[01:22:41.500 --> 01:22:47.540]   But now the Supreme Court is going to address this and answer the question whether her perception
[01:22:47.540 --> 01:22:52.980]   that her husband and tenant harm is enough to warrant a crime or do you need to, in prosecution,
[01:22:52.980 --> 01:22:59.100]   demonstrate that the husband himself was in a threatening state of mind.
[01:22:59.100 --> 01:23:00.500]   This is stuff that's hard to prove.
[01:23:00.500 --> 01:23:04.780]   And tenant is very hard to prove.
[01:23:04.780 --> 01:23:06.300]   And because she had a restraining order.
[01:23:06.300 --> 01:23:07.300]   Yes.
[01:23:07.300 --> 01:23:08.380]   I think that's a good sign right there.
[01:23:08.380 --> 01:23:09.660]   That proves something was up.
[01:23:09.660 --> 01:23:13.300]   I was going to say, the fact that she had the restraining order means that already, I mean,
[01:23:13.300 --> 01:23:17.540]   I would think I'm not a lawyer obviously, but I would think that that means that the judge,
[01:23:17.540 --> 01:23:22.260]   someone has shown that there's clearly a cause for concern and that's why he has the
[01:23:22.260 --> 01:23:23.660]   restraining order issued against him.
[01:23:23.660 --> 01:23:26.220]   But here's the thing, it's on Facebook.
[01:23:26.220 --> 01:23:29.300]   And here's a legal scholar, Garrett Epps, running at the Atlantic said, "If Alana said
[01:23:29.300 --> 01:23:33.060]   sent the threats by mail, there would be little doubt of his intent.
[01:23:33.060 --> 01:23:37.500]   If he had written them in a diary that was discovered by accident, they'd be protected."
[01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:38.500]   Okay.
[01:23:38.500 --> 01:23:41.260]   Where do Facebook postings fall?
[01:23:41.260 --> 01:23:42.260]   I think that's public.
[01:23:42.260 --> 01:23:43.260]   Why is the diary?
[01:23:43.260 --> 01:23:44.260]   It's totally public.
[01:23:44.260 --> 01:23:53.940]   Apparently, because the threats were not communicated and so they are not actually threats.
[01:23:53.940 --> 01:23:55.900]   So the real, and this is why I bring this up.
[01:23:55.900 --> 01:24:02.860]   Otherwise, this would be just a free speech issue, but somehow because of the context,
[01:24:02.860 --> 01:24:09.340]   this threatening, if it's on Facebook, is it really a threat?
[01:24:09.340 --> 01:24:12.780]   And what worries me is if the Supreme Court decides, "Oh, no, that's protected speech,
[01:24:12.780 --> 01:24:17.900]   that is first amendment that speaks to me," then hateful stuff on Facebook and Twitter
[01:24:17.900 --> 01:24:19.420]   is going to have a free reign.
[01:24:19.420 --> 01:24:21.060]   It's not going to happen.
[01:24:21.060 --> 01:24:25.860]   Well, that wouldn't prevent Facebook and Twitter from still banning that sort of threat.
[01:24:25.860 --> 01:24:28.660]   No, in fact, we should be very clear about this.
[01:24:28.660 --> 01:24:35.540]   The First Amendment merely says the government may not prohibit somebody from saying something.
[01:24:35.540 --> 01:24:36.540]   Right.
[01:24:36.540 --> 01:24:37.540]   Text free speech from the government.
[01:24:37.540 --> 01:24:39.620]   And passing a law that says you can't do this is the government.
[01:24:39.620 --> 01:24:40.620]   That's the government.
[01:24:40.620 --> 01:24:41.620]   Right.
[01:24:41.620 --> 01:24:42.620]   I mean, I can ban somebody from my chat room.
[01:24:42.620 --> 01:24:43.620]   I can tell anybody.
[01:24:43.620 --> 01:24:44.620]   And you do.
[01:24:44.620 --> 01:24:46.020]   And I do.
[01:24:46.020 --> 01:24:47.020]   And that's fine.
[01:24:47.020 --> 01:24:50.780]   Facebook can do it and Twitter can do it, but the government can't do it.
[01:24:50.780 --> 01:24:55.660]   Now, I guess what would that mean then is say that they were to rule in favor of the
[01:24:55.660 --> 01:24:57.380]   sky and say that it was protected.
[01:24:57.380 --> 01:25:01.180]   What would that mean then for people who admit to crimes on Facebook?
[01:25:01.180 --> 01:25:08.980]   Because law enforcement uses a lot of Facebook postings now for those sorts of purposes.
[01:25:08.980 --> 01:25:13.020]   So they're to say that this has been private communication because it's on Facebook.
[01:25:13.020 --> 01:25:16.700]   Then when someone's aware about any information that they're delving for that be the same as
[01:25:16.700 --> 01:25:17.980]   getting a diary.
[01:25:17.980 --> 01:25:21.540]   Even if they didn't have a warrant or other things or if they admitted to a crime with
[01:25:21.540 --> 01:25:25.820]   the argument be, well, that was just, you know, by using that wasn't actually anything
[01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:26.820]   else.
[01:25:26.820 --> 01:25:31.780]   The thing that's interesting about that he didn't post this on her wall.
[01:25:31.780 --> 01:25:33.060]   He posted on his wall.
[01:25:33.060 --> 01:25:34.060]   That's why it's more.
[01:25:34.060 --> 01:25:35.060]   They consider this.
[01:25:35.060 --> 01:25:38.220]   I don't think so, but they consider this maybe more like a diary.
[01:25:38.220 --> 01:25:42.340]   But of course, because it's on his wall, it will show up on her wall or other people
[01:25:42.340 --> 01:25:46.460]   who are following her, maybe depending on how he said this.
[01:25:46.460 --> 01:25:47.460]   Everybody.
[01:25:47.460 --> 01:25:49.980]   If you see it, just don't do Facebook at all.
[01:25:49.980 --> 01:25:50.980]   Just get off.
[01:25:50.980 --> 01:25:51.980]   I agree with you.
[01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:55.220]   But I do think this will be an interesting case to watch.
[01:25:55.220 --> 01:25:56.500]   They've heard oral arguments.
[01:25:56.500 --> 01:25:58.060]   You could listen to them.
[01:25:58.060 --> 01:25:59.060]   You know, they do.
[01:25:59.060 --> 01:26:00.060]   They sometimes bring these things in.
[01:26:00.060 --> 01:26:01.380]   They listen for a minute and they kick it back.
[01:26:01.380 --> 01:26:03.020]   So we're not going to deal with this.
[01:26:03.020 --> 01:26:04.540]   Well, they accepted the case.
[01:26:04.540 --> 01:26:06.260]   That's the question is why did they accept the case?
[01:26:06.260 --> 01:26:08.060]   They must have thought there was something.
[01:26:08.060 --> 01:26:09.460]   Oh, maybe we're talking about it.
[01:26:09.460 --> 01:26:11.260]   Let's see the other one.
[01:26:11.260 --> 01:26:12.460]   Internet shopping.
[01:26:12.460 --> 01:26:13.460]   So Colorado.
[01:26:13.460 --> 01:26:25.780]   Decide that they could collect taxes, sales taxes on out of state purchases.
[01:26:25.780 --> 01:26:26.780]   This is what they said.
[01:26:26.780 --> 01:26:32.060]   Colorado in 2010 enacted a law that required out of state merchants to report transactions
[01:26:32.060 --> 01:26:35.460]   to their customers and to state tax authorities.
[01:26:35.460 --> 01:26:41.100]   So right now, the way it works, if a company doesn't do business in that state, they don't
[01:26:41.100 --> 01:26:44.820]   have some physical presence, then they don't have to collect taxes.
[01:26:44.820 --> 01:26:45.980]   You still owe taxes.
[01:26:45.980 --> 01:26:49.740]   In fact, here in the state of California, they ask you on your state form.
[01:26:49.740 --> 01:26:50.740]   I am.
[01:26:50.740 --> 01:26:51.740]   Yeah.
[01:26:51.740 --> 01:26:56.660]   They say, did you buy anything online and not pay sales taxes?
[01:26:56.660 --> 01:27:00.100]   When I'm on Amazon buying stuff, I usually shows up right there as I pay some.
[01:27:00.100 --> 01:27:01.340]   Well, Amazon does collect it now.
[01:27:01.340 --> 01:27:04.980]   Remember what happened was Amazon said, we're not going to collect.
[01:27:04.980 --> 01:27:08.380]   Then the state turned around and said, well, you do business in California because you
[01:27:08.380 --> 01:27:10.380]   have associates, Amazon associates.
[01:27:10.380 --> 01:27:11.380]   Right.
[01:27:11.380 --> 01:27:17.220]   So Amazon cut off the associates, taking money out of a lot of people's pockets, that put
[01:27:17.220 --> 01:27:20.380]   pressure on the state to back down.
[01:27:20.380 --> 01:27:23.780]   They went back and forth and finally there was a negotiated agreement which Amazon said,
[01:27:23.780 --> 01:27:25.620]   all right, we'll start collecting sales taxes.
[01:27:25.620 --> 01:27:27.180]   I think it's next year.
[01:27:27.180 --> 01:27:30.980]   So I'm wondering, by the way, that's good for Amazon because now they're building a
[01:27:30.980 --> 01:27:31.980]   fulfillment center in California.
[01:27:31.980 --> 01:27:35.060]   Tell us who me in Nevada?
[01:27:35.060 --> 01:27:38.100]   They've had one in Nevada right now and that's why they had it in Nevada to serve
[01:27:38.100 --> 01:27:41.540]   as California, but now they can put service centers all over California because they
[01:27:41.540 --> 01:27:43.660]   are finally collecting sales tax.
[01:27:43.660 --> 01:27:48.300]   Colorado didn't say we're going to collect this tax, but we are going to require that
[01:27:48.300 --> 01:27:51.980]   these out of state merchants report to us so that we can go back.
[01:27:51.980 --> 01:27:54.980]   Apparently, it's the only state that does that.
[01:27:54.980 --> 01:27:57.260]   So I'm doing business in Washington state.
[01:27:57.260 --> 01:27:58.180]   I'm paying my taxes.
[01:27:58.180 --> 01:28:00.060]   I'm doing all these things.
[01:28:00.060 --> 01:28:05.620]   And Colorado is going to tax me, even though I get no services from Colorado whatsoever,
[01:28:05.620 --> 01:28:07.140]   but they're going to do tax me.
[01:28:07.140 --> 01:28:09.020]   This is taxation without representation.
[01:28:09.020 --> 01:28:12.340]   No, no, I have a founding problem with the entire system.
[01:28:12.340 --> 01:28:13.340]   We do not.
[01:28:13.340 --> 01:28:14.340]   We're not.
[01:28:14.340 --> 01:28:15.860]   I've got no representation in Colorado yet.
[01:28:15.860 --> 01:28:17.660]   I'm being taxed by these guys.
[01:28:17.660 --> 01:28:19.580]   No, I think it's the other way around.
[01:28:19.580 --> 01:28:24.180]   I think it's if you live in Colorado and you buy something online from a merchant that
[01:28:24.180 --> 01:28:29.860]   doesn't do business in Colorado, the merchant will be required to tell Colorado so that
[01:28:29.860 --> 01:28:31.260]   they can send you a bill.
[01:28:31.260 --> 01:28:32.260]   See, right?
[01:28:32.260 --> 01:28:33.700]   Several states have laws like that.
[01:28:33.700 --> 01:28:34.700]   Well, actually Washington state has a-
[01:28:34.700 --> 01:28:35.700]   Clean taxes.
[01:28:35.700 --> 01:28:36.700]   But no one does it.
[01:28:36.700 --> 01:28:37.700]   No, but you're right.
[01:28:37.700 --> 01:28:38.980]   In fact, that's the joke of it.
[01:28:38.980 --> 01:28:40.780]   Washington state has the same kind of arrangement.
[01:28:40.780 --> 01:28:41.780]   Right.
[01:28:41.780 --> 01:28:43.620]   Well, they never collected.
[01:28:43.620 --> 01:28:48.140]   You guys show up and you're supposed to give them some money and they, here's your stuff.
[01:28:48.140 --> 01:28:52.300]   In fact, I think in Texas, the- it's up to consumer to report the purchases.
[01:28:52.300 --> 01:28:53.620]   Well, that's California too.
[01:28:53.620 --> 01:28:55.380]   California as well.
[01:28:55.380 --> 01:28:58.820]   So Colorado is going to say, hey, we already know.
[01:28:58.820 --> 01:29:00.980]   We're just going to send you a bill.
[01:29:00.980 --> 01:29:05.740]   Anyway, the Supreme Court's going to take a look at that.
[01:29:05.740 --> 01:29:06.740]   And we shall see-
[01:29:06.740 --> 01:29:09.100]   Yeah, that'll actually be the interesting case.
[01:29:09.100 --> 01:29:10.100]   Yeah.
[01:29:10.100 --> 01:29:15.860]   You know, in the budget agreement that was just passed, there is an extension of the
[01:29:15.860 --> 01:29:20.140]   ban on internet, federal internet taxes, so consumer taxes.
[01:29:20.140 --> 01:29:21.860]   Was there on this new budget?
[01:29:21.860 --> 01:29:22.860]   Yeah.
[01:29:22.860 --> 01:29:23.860]   Yeah.
[01:29:23.860 --> 01:29:24.860]   So I think it's through October of 2015.
[01:29:24.860 --> 01:29:25.860]   I'm again.
[01:29:25.860 --> 01:29:26.860]   It will be that.
[01:29:26.860 --> 01:29:31.140]   No, I think the internet should- I don't see why an internet should not have to be as
[01:29:31.140 --> 01:29:35.020]   responsible for sales taxes as a brick and mortar entity.
[01:29:35.020 --> 01:29:40.860]   I'm doing- I have a business in Washington state, and you're living in California, and
[01:29:40.860 --> 01:29:43.100]   you want one of my products, so I ship it to you.
[01:29:43.100 --> 01:29:44.100]   Yeah.
[01:29:44.100 --> 01:29:45.100]   And you want to pay taxes for it?
[01:29:45.100 --> 01:29:46.660]   I don't want to, but I'm just saying-
[01:29:46.660 --> 01:29:49.060]   But I don't have a presence in- I don't have no presence.
[01:29:49.060 --> 01:29:52.420]   I'm not getting any of the benefits of the tax.
[01:29:52.420 --> 01:29:54.020]   Taxes are to benefit from tax.
[01:29:54.020 --> 01:29:58.820]   I run a company in Petaluma, and I have to tax everybody because Petaluma's got goods
[01:29:58.820 --> 01:30:03.660]   and services and sewers, and it gives me all these benefits of paying the taxes.
[01:30:03.660 --> 01:30:05.980]   You're just collecting the tax.
[01:30:05.980 --> 01:30:06.980]   I know, but it's-
[01:30:06.980 --> 01:30:07.980]   It's a tax on me.
[01:30:07.980 --> 01:30:11.460]   I'm getting the benefit, and you're collecting it and paying it to the state on my behalf.
[01:30:11.460 --> 01:30:12.460]   Somebody's benefiting.
[01:30:12.460 --> 01:30:13.460]   Thank you.
[01:30:13.460 --> 01:30:15.220]   Yeah, the state is, because I live in the state.
[01:30:15.220 --> 01:30:18.260]   Well, I know, but you're benefiting too, because the state gives you goods and services
[01:30:18.260 --> 01:30:19.260]   and put sewers into your-
[01:30:19.260 --> 01:30:21.060]   You're just collecting- you're not keeping it.
[01:30:21.060 --> 01:30:22.060]   You're collecting the tax and passing on the state.
[01:30:22.060 --> 01:30:23.700]   It's a pain in the ass.
[01:30:23.700 --> 01:30:26.700]   I have to collect taxes for all these- for all these different-
[01:30:26.700 --> 01:30:27.700]   Oh, come on.
[01:30:27.700 --> 01:30:28.700]   That's what your-
[01:30:28.700 --> 01:30:29.700]   The futures-
[01:30:29.700 --> 01:30:30.700]   The futures-
[01:30:30.700 --> 01:30:31.700]   That's the argument Amazon uses.
[01:30:31.700 --> 01:30:36.620]   How many tax jurisdictions- there's no way we could figure that out, but that's BS.
[01:30:36.620 --> 01:30:37.860]   Of course they could figure that out.
[01:30:37.860 --> 01:30:39.380]   That's what computers are for.
[01:30:39.380 --> 01:30:40.380]   It's a trivial calculation.
[01:30:40.380 --> 01:30:41.380]   Right.
[01:30:41.380 --> 01:30:42.380]   And then I get-
[01:30:42.380 --> 01:30:43.380]   Okay, you'll lose-
[01:30:43.380 --> 01:30:44.380]   Okay, then find this.
[01:30:44.380 --> 01:30:45.380]   What do I have to do?
[01:30:45.380 --> 01:30:47.340]   I have to send out 48 checks to all the different states.
[01:30:47.340 --> 01:30:48.340]   Yes.
[01:30:48.340 --> 01:30:49.340]   Ah, bull.
[01:30:49.340 --> 01:30:50.340]   This is anti-business.
[01:30:50.340 --> 01:30:52.140]   This is just you and your anti-business attitude.
[01:30:52.140 --> 01:30:56.980]   Why should the internet be exempt from taxation when every other brick and mortar is?
[01:30:56.980 --> 01:31:01.660]   Well, because every mail order company for the last 100 years has never paid taxes.
[01:31:01.660 --> 01:31:03.500]   It's just the way it goes.
[01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:07.020]   There's nothing different to me from an internet company and a mail order company.
[01:31:07.020 --> 01:31:08.700]   It's the same exact model.
[01:31:08.700 --> 01:31:11.740]   Why has it changed all of a sudden because of Amazon?
[01:31:11.740 --> 01:31:14.820]   Because they're out to be more effective than Sears was in 1919?
[01:31:14.820 --> 01:31:18.340]   Well, the reasons change because bookstores are going out of business because Amazon doesn't
[01:31:18.340 --> 01:31:19.340]   have to collect taxes.
[01:31:19.340 --> 01:31:22.700]   Bookstores are not going out of business because of the tax.
[01:31:22.700 --> 01:31:28.060]   Bookstores are going out of business for a myriad of reasons and tax is not one of them.
[01:31:28.060 --> 01:31:29.660]   Tax is one of them, but-
[01:31:29.660 --> 01:31:30.660]   You're right.
[01:31:30.660 --> 01:31:37.660]   Well, it's what gave Amazon a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big,
[01:31:37.660 --> 01:31:42.660]   a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big,
[01:31:42.660 --> 01:31:43.660]   a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big,
[01:31:43.660 --> 01:31:46.660]   a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big,
[01:31:46.660 --> 01:31:49.660]   a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big,
[01:31:49.660 --> 01:31:56.660]   a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big,
[01:31:56.660 --> 01:32:02.660]   a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big,
[01:32:02.660 --> 01:32:07.660]   a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big,
[01:32:07.660 --> 01:32:12.660]   a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big,
[01:32:12.660 --> 01:32:18.660]   a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big,
[01:32:18.660 --> 01:32:23.660]   a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big,
[01:32:23.660 --> 01:32:30.660]   a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big,
[01:32:30.660 --> 01:32:36.660]   a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big,
[01:32:36.660 --> 01:32:41.660]   a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big,
[01:32:41.660 --> 01:33:11.660]   a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big,
[01:33:11.660 --> 01:33:18.660]   a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big,

[01:51:20.660 --> 01:51:23.660]   a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big, a big,
[01:51:23.660 --> 01:51:27.660]   a lot of games on the Odyssey. I did. I played the one game.
[01:51:27.660 --> 01:51:30.660]   I didn't know they were, they were any others. We certainly had,
[01:51:30.660 --> 01:51:33.660]   you know, we certainly got the others as they came up, but,
[01:51:33.660 --> 01:51:38.660]   but yeah, I love this. And HBO is going to go ahead. We've heard rumors,
[01:51:38.660 --> 01:51:42.660]   but they're going to go ahead with streaming content on the Internet.
[01:51:42.660 --> 01:51:45.660]   However, a little bit of a slap in the face for their,
[01:51:45.660 --> 01:51:50.660]   their former CTO who had created a,
[01:51:50.660 --> 01:51:55.660]   a streaming video office in the Seattle,
[01:51:55.660 --> 01:51:59.660]   they hired 55 people, many of them, his ex colleagues from Microsoft.
[01:51:59.660 --> 01:52:03.660]   HBO was rumored to have spent as much as $100 million a year
[01:52:03.660 --> 01:52:09.660]   on this auto-burkeys, the CTO quit when he learned that HBO was
[01:52:09.660 --> 01:52:12.660]   going to go to Major League Baseball for the streaming technology
[01:52:12.660 --> 01:52:14.660]   for their new website.
[01:52:14.660 --> 01:52:15.660]   Isn't that silver light?
[01:52:15.660 --> 01:52:16.660]   Oh, I hope not.
[01:52:16.660 --> 01:52:17.660]   Oh, no.
[01:52:17.660 --> 01:52:18.660]   Oh, my God.
[01:52:18.660 --> 01:52:20.660]   That Major League Baseball was silver light.
[01:52:20.660 --> 01:52:21.660]   MLB works well.
[01:52:21.660 --> 01:52:22.660]   Yeah, it does.
[01:52:22.660 --> 01:52:23.660]   It works.
[01:52:23.660 --> 01:52:24.660]   It works well if you get it.
[01:52:24.660 --> 01:52:27.660]   It can't be silver light because it's on the iPad. It's on the iPhone.
[01:52:27.660 --> 01:52:28.660]   It's not everything.
[01:52:28.660 --> 01:52:29.660]   It's on every planet.
[01:52:29.660 --> 01:52:31.660]   Well, I mean, it's silver light is just the front end. I mean,
[01:52:31.660 --> 01:52:34.660]   at this point, even Netflix is now HTML5. Silver light is being
[01:52:34.660 --> 01:52:37.660]   deprecated in any way, but yeah, no, I mean, MLB works really well.
[01:52:37.660 --> 01:52:41.660]   And, and I guess from, from what I understand, you know, the CTO,
[01:52:41.660 --> 01:52:45.660]   he was building out his own technology and they've done pretty well.
[01:52:45.660 --> 01:52:48.660]   I mean, HBO has had some, you know, a band with problems after
[01:52:48.660 --> 01:52:51.660]   the game of thrones episodes, but they've done fairly well with
[01:52:51.660 --> 01:52:52.660]   keeping up the demand.
[01:52:52.660 --> 01:52:54.660]   But I think I guess internally they looked at it and said, you
[01:52:54.660 --> 01:52:58.660]   know, if we have this, this pure online only play with live stuff,
[01:52:58.660 --> 01:53:01.660]   we're not convinced that we'll be able to support the number of
[01:53:01.660 --> 01:53:05.660]   of, of, of concurrent users and MLB has proven that they can do it
[01:53:05.660 --> 01:53:08.660]   really well on lots of other devices and lots of different
[01:53:08.660 --> 01:53:09.660]   markets.
[01:53:09.660 --> 01:53:11.660]   So, I mean, it probably does make more sense for them to just use
[01:53:11.660 --> 01:53:15.660]   proven technology, but, you know, it was a, it was an affront to
[01:53:15.660 --> 01:53:16.660]   the CTO, so he's gone now.
[01:53:16.660 --> 01:53:17.660]   Yeah.
[01:53:17.660 --> 01:53:20.660]   But it's not clear what's going to happen with the original HBO
[01:53:20.660 --> 01:53:22.660]   Go with this either, right?
[01:53:22.660 --> 01:53:25.660]   HBO Go uses the old technology, non-MLA.
[01:53:25.660 --> 01:53:26.660]   Right.
[01:53:26.660 --> 01:53:28.660]   I think what they're saying basically is we're going to, we're
[01:53:28.660 --> 01:53:31.660]   not going to, we're going to stop using this HBO Go.
[01:53:31.660 --> 01:53:33.660]   Yeah, they'll probably shift over. I mean, and yeah, it's not
[01:53:33.660 --> 01:53:36.660]   clear yet if it's going to basically be, if this streaming
[01:53:36.660 --> 01:53:39.660]   thing is going to basically be HBO Go plus live stuff or if it's
[01:53:39.660 --> 01:53:42.660]   going to be just a standalone property, if it's going to have,
[01:53:42.660 --> 01:53:45.660]   you know, but the price point is going to be, I still say,
[01:53:45.660 --> 01:53:48.660]   I'm predicting $20 a month is what they're going to charge and I
[01:53:48.660 --> 01:53:49.660]   stand by.
[01:53:49.660 --> 01:53:53.660]   And will it, will it require a cable company subscription?
[01:53:53.660 --> 01:53:55.660]   No, not a 20 budget, but or not.
[01:53:55.660 --> 01:53:58.660]   No, well, and that's the whole reason that I think they're going
[01:53:58.660 --> 01:54:01.660]   to charge $20 because at this point they get so much money from
[01:54:01.660 --> 01:54:05.660]   the cable companies who are offering it as part of tie-in deals
[01:54:05.660 --> 01:54:08.660]   and they get so much free promotion with that that they will
[01:54:08.660 --> 01:54:10.660]   probably offer you a standalone saying, hey, you don't have to
[01:54:10.660 --> 01:54:13.660]   have a cable subscription, you can just subscribe to HBO, but
[01:54:13.660 --> 01:54:17.660]   they're going to charge $20 a month as a way to probably A,
[01:54:17.660 --> 01:54:20.660]   appease the cable companies and B, you know, frankly make, you
[01:54:20.660 --> 01:54:23.660]   know, a similar amount of profit that they're getting from the
[01:54:23.660 --> 01:54:25.660]   cable subs that they do at $10 a month.
[01:54:25.660 --> 01:54:29.660]   It'd be cheaper for me to subscribe to HBO without having to
[01:54:29.660 --> 01:54:32.660]   detach from my cable and it would be to pay the 15 or whatever it
[01:54:32.660 --> 01:54:34.660]   is that I pay as part of my cable plan.
[01:54:34.660 --> 01:54:38.660]   So I can't see them going below what it costs me as part of
[01:54:38.660 --> 01:54:39.660]   my cable package.
[01:54:39.660 --> 01:54:44.660]   Apparently the technology which was co-named Maui will continue
[01:54:44.660 --> 01:54:49.660]   to be, well, they're canceling the Maui project, but it sounds
[01:54:49.660 --> 01:54:52.660]   like they're going to continue to use it with HBO Go.
[01:54:52.660 --> 01:54:56.660]   A large portion of Maui's efforts they wrote can be repurposed for
[01:54:56.660 --> 01:54:58.660]   HBO Go, a top priority for HBO.
[01:54:58.660 --> 01:55:01.660]   So many people are sharing HBO Go passwords.
[01:55:01.660 --> 01:55:05.660]   In fact, I think there's probably just one HBO Go password
[01:55:05.660 --> 01:55:06.660]   that everybody uses it.
[01:55:06.660 --> 01:55:10.660]   But it'll be, you know, they'll obviously shut that down, but
[01:55:10.660 --> 01:55:13.660]   the question becomes what happens to cable subscribers who are
[01:55:13.660 --> 01:55:17.660]   legitimately using HBO Go to watch, you know, when they're away
[01:55:17.660 --> 01:55:20.660]   from home, well, you know, will they have to use this new platform
[01:55:20.660 --> 01:55:21.660]   as well?
[01:55:21.660 --> 01:55:23.660]   Will they be able to continue to use the simple app, you know, that
[01:55:23.660 --> 01:55:24.660]   HBO Go?
[01:55:24.660 --> 01:55:25.660]   This could be really good news for me.
[01:55:25.660 --> 01:55:28.660]   I'll finally be able to get off of a Comcast.
[01:55:28.660 --> 01:55:32.660]   If I get HBO, that's like 90% of what I care about.
[01:55:32.660 --> 01:55:36.660]   So the other thing is with HBO is a lot of people subscribe for
[01:55:36.660 --> 01:55:38.660]   specific shows that last only a certain amount of time.
[01:55:38.660 --> 01:55:39.660]   Right.
[01:55:39.660 --> 01:55:42.660]   So like I like, you know, the newsroom, which is going away,
[01:55:42.660 --> 01:55:44.660]   or I'm not a big game of Thrones fan.
[01:55:44.660 --> 01:55:48.660]   But if so, I'd watch it for, I'd pay that $20 a month for, you know,
[01:55:48.660 --> 01:55:51.660]   three or four months and then stop when there's nothing on that
[01:55:51.660 --> 01:55:52.660]   I want to see.
[01:55:52.660 --> 01:55:53.660]   And then come back later.
[01:55:53.660 --> 01:55:55.660]   And that's always been the case.
[01:55:55.660 --> 01:55:57.660]   And I mean, actually that was one of the main reasons they
[01:55:57.660 --> 01:56:00.660]   rolled out HBO Go to begin with was that basically, because it
[01:56:00.660 --> 01:56:02.660]   has all the past content available to.
[01:56:02.660 --> 01:56:05.660]   And so, you know, you have the Supremas, you have Sex and City,
[01:56:05.660 --> 01:56:07.660]   you have, you know, these classic shows, you have documentaries,
[01:56:07.660 --> 01:56:09.660]   you have a huge array of content.
[01:56:09.660 --> 01:56:14.660]   And when I interviewed HBO at the time, I guess, 2011 and rolled out,
[01:56:14.660 --> 01:56:15.660]   you know, they are very clear.
[01:56:15.660 --> 01:56:18.660]   They said, you know, we are willing to give up our home video
[01:56:18.660 --> 01:56:22.660]   business in exchange for hoping that we can keep people subscribed
[01:56:22.660 --> 01:56:25.660]   longer because exactly like you said, white, most people do go in
[01:56:25.660 --> 01:56:29.660]   in spurts and drops, you know, where they are not consistently
[01:56:29.660 --> 01:56:31.660]   subscribed, you know, month over month.
[01:56:31.660 --> 01:56:34.660]   And in Netflix is this too where they see fluctuations in people
[01:56:34.660 --> 01:56:35.660]   subscribing.
[01:56:35.660 --> 01:56:38.660]   And I think that the goal with HBO Go and whatever this new thing
[01:56:38.660 --> 01:56:43.660]   is is that by providing not just live access to the content, but
[01:56:43.660 --> 01:56:46.660]   also the entire back catalog, they can entice people to continue
[01:56:46.660 --> 01:56:50.660]   to be part of it, you know, because they feel like, hey, I never
[01:56:50.660 --> 01:56:53.660]   know when I might want to watch, you know, old episodes of something
[01:56:53.660 --> 01:56:55.660]   that I want to catch up on on some other content.
[01:56:55.660 --> 01:56:57.660]   We're watching too much television in this country.
[01:56:57.660 --> 01:56:58.660]   I agree.
[01:56:58.660 --> 01:56:59.660]   Read a book.
[01:56:59.660 --> 01:57:00.660]   Read a book.
[01:57:00.660 --> 01:57:01.660]   Yeah.
[01:57:01.660 --> 01:57:04.660]   A cousin of Jan, our chat room says, by the way, if you want that HBO
[01:57:04.660 --> 01:57:07.660]   Go password that everybody's using, it's in the Sony documents.
[01:57:07.660 --> 01:57:08.660]   Just do it.
[01:57:08.660 --> 01:57:09.660]   That's true.
[01:57:09.660 --> 01:57:10.660]   Do a search.
[01:57:10.660 --> 01:57:11.660]   Sure, there's Warren a few in here.
[01:57:11.660 --> 01:57:12.660]   You're fine.
[01:57:12.660 --> 01:57:15.660]   If you have not yet read Christina Warren's great story on the
[01:57:15.660 --> 01:57:19.660]   true story of the Jobs movie, it's on Mashable.com.
[01:57:19.660 --> 01:57:20.660]   Great work on that.
[01:57:20.660 --> 01:57:24.660]   Christina Warren, we love having you on at film underscore girl.
[01:57:24.660 --> 01:57:26.660]   Go back to your gaming.
[01:57:26.660 --> 01:57:29.660]   I will kill something for me.
[01:57:29.660 --> 01:57:31.660]   I appreciate your being here.
[01:57:31.660 --> 01:57:32.660]   It's always great to see you.
[01:57:32.660 --> 01:57:33.660]   Thank you.
[01:57:33.660 --> 01:57:34.660]   Thank you so much.
[01:57:34.660 --> 01:57:35.660]   Thanks to John C. Devorak.
[01:57:35.660 --> 01:57:38.660]   No agenda show.com now twice weekly in the morning.
[01:57:38.660 --> 01:57:39.660]   Exactly.
[01:57:39.660 --> 01:57:43.660]   And at the real Devorak would be a good thing to get.
[01:57:43.660 --> 01:57:44.660]   Follow him on the Twitter.
[01:57:44.660 --> 01:57:47.660]   I might get to my 100,000 mark.
[01:57:47.660 --> 01:57:51.660]   If he got enough cloud, he could then get the HBO, I'm sorry, the
[01:57:51.660 --> 01:57:53.660]   Comcast executive team to call him.
[01:57:53.660 --> 01:57:55.660]   Actually, I noticed the last time I did my complaining on Twitter, I
[01:57:55.660 --> 01:57:58.660]   got all these different, there's like a lot of these people now.
[01:57:58.660 --> 01:58:00.660]   Oh, let me know what's going on.
[01:58:00.660 --> 01:58:01.660]   Is it improving?
[01:58:01.660 --> 01:58:03.660]   Will you have a few more followers?
[01:58:03.660 --> 01:58:05.660]   Then they'll just call up and say stop tweeting.
[01:58:05.660 --> 01:58:07.660]   Stop tweeting about it.
[01:58:07.660 --> 01:58:08.660]   They send me a check.
[01:58:08.660 --> 01:58:09.660]   I'll stop tweeting.
[01:58:09.660 --> 01:58:11.660]   Send me a check.
[01:58:11.660 --> 01:58:13.660]   You're going to refund.
[01:58:13.660 --> 01:58:14.660]   Yeah, refund.
[01:58:14.660 --> 01:58:15.660]   A refund.
[01:58:15.660 --> 01:58:16.660]   Yeah, I need a refund.
[01:58:16.660 --> 01:58:17.660]   I don't get my full bandwidth.
[01:58:17.660 --> 01:58:18.660]   I need more.
[01:58:18.660 --> 01:58:21.660]   I should get credits.
[01:58:21.660 --> 01:58:22.660]   I should get credits.
[01:58:22.660 --> 01:58:24.660]   I shouldn't be paying this monthly bill.
[01:58:24.660 --> 01:58:27.660]   $100 for $750K.
[01:58:27.660 --> 01:58:28.660]   That's what gets me.
[01:58:28.660 --> 01:58:31.660]   I think my Comcast bill is closer to $200 a month.
[01:58:31.660 --> 01:58:33.660]   When I added all this stuff, I pay.
[01:58:33.660 --> 01:58:34.660]   It's a scam.
[01:58:34.660 --> 01:58:36.660]   Paying them to beat me up.
[01:58:36.660 --> 01:58:39.660]   Drunk up there is a drinking game.
[01:58:39.660 --> 01:58:41.660]   If I say scam, they have to drink.
[01:58:41.660 --> 01:58:42.660]   Scam.
[01:58:42.660 --> 01:58:43.660]   Scam.
[01:58:43.660 --> 01:58:44.660]   Scam.
[01:58:44.660 --> 01:58:45.660]   What do they drink?
[01:58:45.660 --> 01:58:46.660]   Scam.
[01:58:46.660 --> 01:58:47.660]   Yeah.
[01:58:47.660 --> 01:58:48.660]   It's a scam.
[01:58:48.660 --> 01:58:49.660]   Yeah, I know of me.
[01:58:49.660 --> 01:58:50.660]   I have to say it.
[01:58:50.660 --> 01:58:51.660]   Scam it.
[01:58:51.660 --> 01:58:52.660]   Or you have to say it if I say it that doesn't count.
[01:58:52.660 --> 01:58:53.660]   Well, they could change the game.
[01:58:53.660 --> 01:58:56.660]   Dwight Silverman is at the Houston Chronicle.
[01:58:56.660 --> 01:58:59.660]   Blog.cron.com/deckblog.
[01:58:59.660 --> 01:59:00.660]   Always great to have you on.
[01:59:00.660 --> 01:59:03.660]   I realize on Sunday night you go into work just to show.
[01:59:03.660 --> 01:59:04.660]   Yes, I do.
[01:59:04.660 --> 01:59:06.660]   But I live about two miles away from downtown.
[01:59:06.660 --> 01:59:07.660]   Oh, okay.
[01:59:07.660 --> 01:59:08.660]   Still.
[01:59:08.660 --> 01:59:09.660]   That's not that big a deal.
[01:59:09.660 --> 01:59:10.660]   That's awfully nice of you.
[01:59:10.660 --> 01:59:13.660]   So, and you know, by the way, John, I'm sorry you're not getting your band with.
[01:59:13.660 --> 01:59:19.660]   I pay about 65 a month for Comcast and I get about 112 megabits down.
[01:59:19.660 --> 01:59:21.660]   Yeah, thanks.
[01:59:21.660 --> 01:59:22.660]   Thanks for telling me that.
[01:59:22.660 --> 01:59:23.660]   I really need that information.
[01:59:23.660 --> 01:59:29.220]   You need to move to Texas where we have, you know, we rely mostly on property taxes, have
[01:59:29.220 --> 01:59:33.380]   no sales tax, and everybody's just really happy.
[01:59:33.380 --> 01:59:36.660]   Which is a form of wealth tax on my dad.
[01:59:36.660 --> 01:59:38.780]   Thank you everybody for being here.
[01:59:38.780 --> 01:59:40.580]   We have a lot of fun every Sunday afternoon.
[01:59:40.580 --> 01:59:44.580]   It starts at 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time, 2300 UTC.
[01:59:44.580 --> 01:59:45.580]   If you can watch live.
[01:59:45.580 --> 01:59:48.580]   I love it because we love having a live audience.
[01:59:48.580 --> 01:59:49.580]   You can also visit us in the studio.
[01:59:49.580 --> 01:59:50.580]   We have some good people here today.
[01:59:50.580 --> 01:59:51.580]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:59:51.580 --> 01:59:54.580]   Tickets at Twit.tv will put a chair out for you.
[01:59:54.580 --> 01:59:55.580]   Oh, just show up.
[01:59:55.580 --> 01:59:57.580]   Well, you know what?
[01:59:57.580 --> 02:00:00.580]   One, two, three, four, five, six, like 10 people did show.
[02:00:00.580 --> 02:00:01.580]   So you're right.
[02:00:01.580 --> 02:00:02.580]   Don't bother.
[02:00:02.580 --> 02:00:03.580]   Just show up.
[02:00:03.580 --> 02:00:07.580]   I do want you to email us if you want to be here for New Year's Eve because it's going
[02:00:07.580 --> 02:00:08.580]   to be crazy on New Year's Eve.
[02:00:08.580 --> 02:00:09.580]   Crazy, crazy.
[02:00:09.580 --> 02:00:10.580]   I hope you're going to come for that.
[02:00:10.580 --> 02:00:12.580]   I'm maybe in Washington State.
[02:00:12.580 --> 02:00:16.580]   3 a.m. New Year's Eve to 3 a.m. New Year's Day.
[02:00:16.580 --> 02:00:17.580]   It's a 24-hour marathon.
[02:00:17.580 --> 02:00:19.580]   A benefit for UNICEF.
[02:00:19.580 --> 02:00:20.580]   That's a good idea.
[02:00:20.580 --> 02:00:21.580]   Yeah.
[02:00:21.580 --> 02:00:22.580]   Oh, that's great.
[02:00:22.580 --> 02:00:23.580]   Yeah, it's going to be.
[02:00:23.580 --> 02:00:24.580]   I'm taking Jerry Lewis' medal.
[02:00:24.580 --> 02:00:26.580]   We're doing it for the kids.
[02:00:26.580 --> 02:00:29.580]   I'm going to wear a black tie.
[02:00:29.580 --> 02:00:30.580]   Tuxedo.
[02:00:30.580 --> 02:00:31.580]   I'm going to sing it whenever.
[02:00:31.580 --> 02:00:32.580]   I'm going to walk alone.
[02:00:32.580 --> 02:00:34.580]   I'm going to do the whole thing.
[02:00:34.580 --> 02:00:35.580]   Yeah, the singing would do.
[02:00:35.580 --> 02:00:36.580]   You may be leaving that part out.
[02:00:36.580 --> 02:00:38.580]   I'm going to bring in Sammy Day because Junior it'll be amazing.
[02:00:38.580 --> 02:00:40.580]   No, actually we have bands.
[02:00:40.580 --> 02:00:43.580]   We have all sorts of stuff and they're not telling me everything because they want me
[02:00:43.580 --> 02:00:45.580]   to be shocked and surprised.
[02:00:45.580 --> 02:00:47.580]   So why would that be?
[02:00:47.580 --> 02:00:48.580]   Because it's fun.
[02:00:48.580 --> 02:00:49.580]   You may blow up at them.
[02:00:49.580 --> 02:00:50.580]   We can't afford this.
[02:00:50.580 --> 02:00:52.580]   What are you talking about?
[02:00:52.580 --> 02:00:54.580]   A mechanical bull.
[02:00:54.580 --> 02:00:57.580]   Apparently we're taking over the street.
[02:00:57.580 --> 02:00:58.580]   We've got a permit.
[02:00:58.580 --> 02:00:59.580]   Take over the street.
[02:00:59.580 --> 02:01:00.580]   We've got a mechanical bull.
[02:01:00.580 --> 02:01:01.580]   Fireworks.
[02:01:01.580 --> 02:01:02.580]   A bounce house.
[02:01:02.580 --> 02:01:04.580]   And we're going to set the building on fireworks.
[02:01:04.580 --> 02:01:05.580]   Fireworks.
[02:01:05.580 --> 02:01:06.580]   Fireworks.
[02:01:06.580 --> 02:01:07.580]   Fireworks.
[02:01:07.580 --> 02:01:08.580]   We're going to do that.
[02:01:08.580 --> 02:01:11.580]   And we have, by the way, we have people from all over the world.
[02:01:11.580 --> 02:01:15.580]   There are 27 time zones in that 24 hour period.
[02:01:15.580 --> 02:01:20.580]   And John Slanina tells me, I think we have all but seven or eight covered.
[02:01:20.580 --> 02:01:21.580]   Which ones are not telling me?
[02:01:21.580 --> 02:01:22.580]   We still need Alaska.
[02:01:22.580 --> 02:01:23.580]   We still need Jarvis Island.
[02:01:23.580 --> 02:01:25.580]   You've got no problem with Alaska.
[02:01:25.580 --> 02:01:26.580]   I know.
[02:01:26.580 --> 02:01:31.580]   If you, twit.tv/nye, if you can be our Alaska correspondent.
[02:01:31.580 --> 02:01:34.580]   Fiji, Tuvalu, the Marshall Islands.
[02:01:34.580 --> 02:01:36.580]   Marshall is going to be a problem.
[02:01:36.580 --> 02:01:37.580]   Thailand, Vietnam.
[02:01:37.580 --> 02:01:39.580]   We should have Burma.
[02:01:39.580 --> 02:01:40.580]   No, Vietnam.
[02:01:40.580 --> 02:01:41.580]   Cocos.
[02:01:41.580 --> 02:01:42.580]   Bangladesh, Bhutan.
[02:01:42.580 --> 02:01:43.580]   Kurzik.
[02:01:43.580 --> 02:01:44.580]   Kurzik stand.
[02:01:44.580 --> 02:01:45.580]   Kurzik stand.
[02:01:45.580 --> 02:01:46.580]   Kurzik stand.
[02:01:46.580 --> 02:01:47.580]   Kazik stand.
[02:01:47.580 --> 02:01:48.580]   Uzbekistan.
[02:01:48.580 --> 02:01:49.580]   Turkabegas.
[02:01:49.580 --> 02:01:50.580]   Yeah, there's a bunch of these.
[02:01:50.580 --> 02:01:51.580]   Turkmenistan.
[02:01:51.580 --> 02:01:52.580]   Turkmenistan.
[02:01:52.580 --> 02:01:54.580]   We have Afghanistan.
[02:01:54.580 --> 02:01:56.580]   We have Iran.
[02:01:56.580 --> 02:01:58.460]   We have Moscow.
[02:01:58.460 --> 02:02:00.260]   We have Tokyo.
[02:02:00.260 --> 02:02:01.780]   But we don't have Alaska.
[02:02:01.780 --> 02:02:03.580]   That makes no sense, Leo.
[02:02:03.580 --> 02:02:04.580]   No sense.
[02:02:04.580 --> 02:02:06.580]   That's even one of the 48 states.
[02:02:06.580 --> 02:02:07.580]   Yes, exactly.
[02:02:07.580 --> 02:02:10.580]   So you'll have it now.
[02:02:10.580 --> 02:02:14.580]   Twit.tv/nye, if you'd like to be a part of that.
[02:02:14.580 --> 02:02:16.580]   We've got a great best of planned for you.
[02:02:16.580 --> 02:02:17.580]   Thank you, Jason.
[02:02:17.580 --> 02:02:18.580]   You worked very hard on that.
[02:02:18.580 --> 02:02:21.580]   That'll be aired on December 28th.
[02:02:21.580 --> 02:02:24.580]   North Korea needs to be represented.
[02:02:24.580 --> 02:02:25.580]   I agree.
[02:02:25.580 --> 02:02:27.580]   Do we have somebody in North Korea?
[02:02:27.580 --> 02:02:29.580]   No, I think it's in some other time zone.
[02:02:29.580 --> 02:02:30.580]   I think we might.
[02:02:30.580 --> 02:02:31.580]   In China.
[02:02:31.580 --> 02:02:33.580]   I think, is there somebody named Kim?
[02:02:33.580 --> 02:02:34.580]   Kim Jong something?
[02:02:34.580 --> 02:02:35.580]   Kim Jong Un.
[02:02:35.580 --> 02:02:37.580]   How do you print it?
[02:02:37.580 --> 02:02:38.580]   Un Un.
[02:02:38.580 --> 02:02:39.580]   Un.
[02:02:39.580 --> 02:02:41.580]   So that's going to be fun.
[02:02:41.580 --> 02:02:44.580]   Make sure you stop by New Year's Eve because unless you've got a date.
[02:02:44.580 --> 02:02:45.580]   If you've got a date.
[02:02:45.580 --> 02:02:46.580]   Oh, you've got a bringer.
[02:02:46.580 --> 02:02:47.580]   Bringer.
[02:02:47.580 --> 02:02:48.580]   Or him.
[02:02:48.580 --> 02:02:49.580]   Yes, it gots.
[02:02:49.580 --> 02:02:50.580]   Take it at Twit.tv.
[02:02:50.580 --> 02:02:51.580]   Or both.
[02:02:51.580 --> 02:02:52.580]   Take it at Twit.tv because we want to make sure there's enough room.
[02:02:52.580 --> 02:02:54.580]   Because the fire marshal.
[02:02:54.580 --> 02:02:55.580]   No, no, no, no.
[02:02:55.580 --> 02:02:56.580]   Fire marshal.
[02:02:56.580 --> 02:02:57.580]   No?
[02:02:57.580 --> 02:02:58.580]   Ten bucks.
[02:02:58.580 --> 02:03:01.580]   Give them $10 and they go away.
[02:03:01.580 --> 02:03:02.580]   Fire.
[02:03:02.580 --> 02:03:03.580]   Really?
[02:03:03.580 --> 02:03:04.580]   Oh, yeah.
[02:03:04.580 --> 02:03:05.580]   That's all it takes.
[02:03:05.580 --> 02:03:07.580]   You just keep a line out and then just keep on people in.
[02:03:07.580 --> 02:03:08.580]   Or just keep on people in.
[02:03:08.580 --> 02:03:09.580]   Yeah.
[02:03:09.580 --> 02:03:10.580]   Blank check.
[02:03:10.580 --> 02:03:11.580]   We're going to have our velvet robe.
[02:03:11.580 --> 02:03:12.580]   I'll need a velvet robe.
[02:03:12.580 --> 02:03:13.580]   Exactly.
[02:03:13.580 --> 02:03:17.780]   Just keep the line moving and then that way if you get to the fire capacity then people
[02:03:17.780 --> 02:03:21.380]   will just wait and they can just wait for one of the time zones and then you can maybe
[02:03:21.380 --> 02:03:22.380]   filter people out.
[02:03:22.380 --> 02:03:23.380]   And you've got the whole street.
[02:03:23.380 --> 02:03:24.380]   There's no fire marshals.
[02:03:24.380 --> 02:03:25.380]   You don't have to have seen it.
[02:03:25.380 --> 02:03:27.700]   We don't have anybody from Second Life.
[02:03:27.700 --> 02:03:32.080]   What time zone is your husband in?
[02:03:32.080 --> 02:03:33.080]   You guys are going to give me divorce.
[02:03:33.080 --> 02:03:35.080]   He's in the Twilight Zone.
[02:03:35.080 --> 02:03:36.080]   The Twilight Zone.
[02:03:36.080 --> 02:03:37.080]   You guys are going to give me divorce.
[02:03:37.080 --> 02:03:38.080]   No, no, no, no.
[02:03:38.080 --> 02:03:41.180]   But I do have a nice Casper mattress you can sleep on.
[02:03:41.180 --> 02:03:42.180]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:03:42.180 --> 02:03:43.180]   We'll see you next time.
[02:03:43.180 --> 02:03:45.180]   Another twin is in the cam.
[02:03:45.180 --> 02:03:45.180]   [music]
[02:03:45.180 --> 02:03:46.180]   [music]
[02:03:46.180 --> 02:03:47.180]   [music]
[02:03:47.180 --> 02:03:48.180]   [music]
[02:03:48.180 --> 02:03:49.180]   [music]
[02:03:49.180 --> 02:03:56.180]   [music]
[02:03:56.180 --> 02:03:58.180]   Do the twist.
