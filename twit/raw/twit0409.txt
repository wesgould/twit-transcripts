[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:35.560]   day to be here because this is a gonna be a very interesting topic now I know a
[00:04:35.560 --> 00:04:39.200]   lot of people say it's a tech show we don't want you to talk about politics
[00:04:39.200 --> 00:04:42.360]   and I don't know if we are talking about politics there's a lot of tech in this
[00:04:42.360 --> 00:04:48.560]   story it broke this week Glenn Greenwald who is a blogger worked for
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:52.040]   salon for a while I'm gonna take off the tin foil hat if you don't mind my
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:57.840]   thoughts can now emanate freely it's actually quite hot it's a very warm
[00:04:57.840 --> 00:05:05.360]   device he is a former lawyer do you know Glenn because I don't know I've been
[00:05:05.360 --> 00:05:10.600]   reading him for a while he's kind of focused on security yeah he wrote for
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.120]   salon for a while now writes for the Guardian broke a very big story with a
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.960]   PowerPoint presentation for 41 slide PowerPoint presentation that talked
[00:05:18.960 --> 00:05:24.600]   about how the NSA we almost felt like a marketing presentation in fact some
[00:05:24.600 --> 00:05:28.040]   people said this doesn't see this couldn't be real it's like it's like a
[00:05:28.040 --> 00:05:32.920]   marketing presentation yeah that's what it felt like did you go through the 41
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:36.120]   slides the 41 slides aren't released there's only like four or five you only
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:39.840]   showed a few of them anyway what's the point of that a few blurry ones yeah
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:45.320]   well I'm going to maximize this right I don't know about that right we go
[00:05:45.320 --> 00:05:47.600]   through the chronology the story all right I don't know about that so the
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:53.280]   first thing the first thing that we learn from these slides is that data
[00:05:53.280 --> 00:06:02.320]   collection was happening that the slides implied that Google Microsoft
[00:06:02.320 --> 00:06:08.720]   Facebook and others with the notable exception of Twitter Skype yeah war
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:15.640]   well well had giving giving the NSA privileged security their servers
[00:06:15.640 --> 00:06:21.040]   direct access direct access the key phrase in this entire affair and and and
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:24.160]   frankly I think we don't really know what that means I think that there's two
[00:06:24.160 --> 00:06:27.320]   ways to interpret it and in fact it's a litmus test on where your politics lie
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:32.800]   how you interpret this so Larry Page of Google's first blog
[00:06:32.800 --> 00:06:38.680]   responses a blog post has said what the dot dot dot we do not allow government
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:43.960]   access to our servers we respond to government requests for information right
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:48.000]   we vet them with our lawyers we fight as many as we can and when we cannot fight
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:54.640]   it we give it to them and we do so on did he say this on a special server that
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:07:00.160]   we've arranged with them no okay face Mark Zuckerberg Facebook same thing we
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:04.080]   don't do this very much the same thing and before anybody even we before you
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:07.720]   can start talking about this everybody needs to understand that the laws that
[00:07:07.720 --> 00:07:11.080]   allow this say that nobody it's like fight club that's what's the first rule
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:15.480]   you don't talk about it nobody's allowed by law to talk about it so most of the
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:20.720]   stuff that we've heard is probably take a colored by the fact that everybody's
[00:07:20.720 --> 00:07:24.600]   trying not to break the law a lot of these requests for information come from
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:31.200]   national security letters most of which 97% of which as written prevent the
[00:07:31.200 --> 00:07:36.000]   recipient from saying anything at all well but so the the really important thing
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.440]   that we don't know about this whole story is that the original story published in
[00:07:40.440 --> 00:07:43.720]   the Guardian by Glenn Greenwald in the Washington Post they were simultaneous
[00:07:43.720 --> 00:07:47.800]   stories basically alleged I believe the last line of the post story I don't
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:50.800]   remember if it was Greenwell story the poster the last line was they can watch
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:55.960]   you live type your search queries right that's the level of access they have
[00:07:55.960 --> 00:07:59.160]   they have direct access to servers whatever's on them all of your
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:05.400]   information that's there they can see it now that story has been getting softer
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:09.440]   and softer and softer and now we're talking about national security letters
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:14.920]   we're talking about you know they have specific information information the
[00:08:14.920 --> 00:08:19.480]   metadata stuff is like it's out there there's also another story which I think
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:24.440]   has been conflated somewhat where there's a lawsuit filed against Verizon and they
[00:08:24.440 --> 00:08:28.480]   were ordered to turn over some metadata which is not part of this FISA stuff so
[00:08:28.480 --> 00:08:34.120]   there's a lot going on but the core allegation is the government has direct
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:37.880]   and this is the key piece direct access the servers are these enormous cloud
[00:08:37.880 --> 00:08:42.120]   computing companies and they can monitor them in real time so so the way to think
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:45.360]   about this from a technology point of view as opposed to a political one is
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:51.800]   that big data is has come to the security world they're using big data to do
[00:08:51.800 --> 00:08:55.760]   security and what that means is they're they're hoovering up as they say in the
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:59.880]   UK all of the all the data all the metadata whatever it is that they're
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:05.560]   getting and they're processing it the way Google processes data in massive
[00:09:05.560 --> 00:09:10.800]   huge scale and they're you know slicing and dicing it and they're filtering it
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:15.360]   and figuring out what's going on so it's a it's a really really interesting glimpse
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:18.720]   into where everything is going everything is going toward big data and this
[00:09:18.720 --> 00:09:23.440]   happens to be a security right and then and then the the question I think the
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:27.800]   problem is that's great you kind of you want the law the law enforcement
[00:09:27.800 --> 00:09:31.720]   community to be making use of the tools right you want them to catch the bad
[00:09:31.720 --> 00:09:35.800]   guys the question is what data are they using to catch the bad guys how much of
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:39.760]   our data are they using and what are the constraints upon their acquisition
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:44.080]   and and retention of that data and we don't have any of those answers like not
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:47.320]   a single one and right now where the story is and this is why I said I don't
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:50.560]   know if the rest of the sides are coming out right now the story has landed at
[00:09:50.560 --> 00:09:55.280]   the Guardian the Washington Post made these incredible accusations the
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:59.520]   industry has denied them the government has said you know your senators and your
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:02.600]   lawmakers they all know about it both parties all the intelligence committees
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:08.160]   that keep approving it this is just as the same as ever and there's no evidence
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:12.320]   on either side to prove which allegation is true and then the Guardian today
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:17.400]   pivoted their story from this pile of evidence they say they have to the
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:21.000]   person who's presented the evidence and I think that's not in this snowed in this
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.480]   whistle blower and I think that's really fascinating and I don't know why you would
[00:10:24.480 --> 00:10:29.320]   if you have this collection of smoking guns why you would suddenly turn to the
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:32.640]   leaker instead of the evidence again we can only say you don't we don't know I
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:36.160]   don't know do you suppose that that's because of pressure from the government
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:40.240]   to back down or because they realize they didn't have a story I don't know I don't
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:44.080]   know and my my instinct is to be as negative as possible and to say that the
[00:10:44.080 --> 00:10:46.880]   government definitely has this access they can't talk about it because I don't
[00:10:46.880 --> 00:10:50.480]   know why they wouldn't want this access and I don't know why so what in the
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:54.720]   culture of secrets secrecy that we have especially around terrorism why they
[00:10:54.720 --> 00:10:58.480]   wouldn't make use of every like legal and political angle to get the access they
[00:10:58.480 --> 00:11:02.240]   would do it so Claire can Miller writing in the New York Times said in at least
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:05.800]   two cases Google and Facebook one of the plans discussed was to build
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:10.560]   separate secure portals like a digital version of the secure physical rooms that
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:14.360]   have long existed for classified information in some instances on
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:19.280]   company servers so would be a Google server for instance through these
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:22.640]   online rooms the governments would request data companies would deposit it
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:27.920]   the government would retrieve it that seems like a reasonable procedure in fact
[00:11:27.920 --> 00:11:31.600]   probably a more secure procedure than emailing it or sending them a box of
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:36.160]   documents I think you'd you'd want the wrong with that yeah so the question is
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:40.240]   is that what's happening or do they really have this backdoor access and no
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:43.920]   one knows and it really comes down to what you believe yeah and I think what was
[00:11:43.920 --> 00:11:47.760]   so interesting is all these statements came out from the tech companies and they
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:52.320]   were so similar so similar I mean I sat down I highlighted them and it was like
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:56.480]   interesting it was like somebody wrote it for them well well or that they
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:12:01.520]   coordinated it or that they were very careful with the language I think you're
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:04.880]   a Silicon Valley general counsel I think you probably know all the other
[00:12:04.880 --> 00:12:08.440]   Silicon Valley general councils what are we gonna say guys yeah and I think you
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:11.040]   just have that phone call and Larry Page did it I don't understand the ominous
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:14.120]   with it was it was not from it was not from Larry Page it was from Larry Page
[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:20.200]   and Google's top lawyer and so that tells me that Larry Page is worried about
[00:12:20.200 --> 00:12:24.720]   actually breaking the law he's worried about covering his behind why else would
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:28.680]   you co-write a message about you know your company not doing something with
[00:12:28.680 --> 00:12:32.400]   coming from your lawyer spring in the air I mean it was from both of them I
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:34.920]   mean Larry Page is probably like we should just move everybody to the island
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:38.320]   okay well let's start with what law are we talking about that they're breaking
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:42.560]   they take all the with the other by the way with the Fourth Amendment what
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:46.280]   right the Fourth Amendment says the government is a search and seizure the
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:49.840]   government these are private companies they can do whatever they want whatever
[00:12:49.840 --> 00:12:53.280]   they want and that's what they're doing so and by why wasn't anybody
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:57.440]   complaining for example when they came out with oh all your email that's 180
[00:12:57.440 --> 00:13:02.040]   days old it's good to go you which remember when that happened you talked
[00:13:02.040 --> 00:13:06.120]   about on the show and or the one that really that was that was a federal law
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:10.480]   it was this it was leading to this and the other one which really cracks me up
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:16.560]   is oh well we're gonna give AT&T Verizon and everybody else immunity from all
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:21.440]   past crimes which means the wiretapping laws right nobody bitched then but now
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:25.160]   because of this everyone's complaining remember in 2006 the NSA whistle blower
[00:13:25.160 --> 00:13:29.120]   said I was in a closet there's a special room at AT&T headquarters in
[00:13:29.120 --> 00:13:33.880]   Francisco what was the name Benny Benny and this is all this AT&T stuff
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:37.280]   he said this was going on then now the president said I'm not listening to
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:40.760]   phone calls we're not reading emails they're not we are watching the movement
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:44.320]   we're looking at phone numbers trends we're watching trends yeah there is a lot
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:48.480]   of information that law is being broken by Google you said there was a law being
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:52.920]   broken the risk of breaking law by even talking about one law they've already
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:56.320]   fought the national security letters in fact Google's the only one to stand up
[00:13:56.320 --> 00:14:00.200]   to these things Microsoft if you listen to their commentary they said oh we're
[00:14:00.200 --> 00:14:04.440]   not volunteering anything which means they got a national security letter and
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:07.440]   so they're forced to give this information over there I would like the
[00:14:07.440 --> 00:14:11.120]   way nobody's no lobbying nobody's forced to put up a private room for the
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:16.640]   NSA but but there's not to do it well not I mean you know Twitter has a big
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:20.000]   difference between up giving them the fire hose right Twitter won't do it they
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.480]   said oh we're not gonna put Twitter the Twitter's been asked yeah but Twitter
[00:14:23.480 --> 00:14:28.160]   sells the fire hose that's what they're holding out for yeah so Twitter is you
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:32.600]   can buy the fire hose from them well not a direct message public tweets right I
[00:14:32.600 --> 00:14:36.280]   mean Twitter gets routinely asked for data we like wait wait I cover the
[00:14:36.280 --> 00:14:41.440]   Twitter gets asked for data by by rogue government or something to the lab
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:46.120]   rare everything that go to the library not direct messages so there is private
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:50.360]   stuff on Twitter I don't think the FBI or this NSA wants the public tweets they
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:54.080]   can get that right what they want is the end well they can get a lot of
[00:14:54.080 --> 00:14:58.480]   searches and so great it's like not perfect and since we're talking about
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:15:02.920]   who's giving up what I read something that said that 98% of the data is coming
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:06.480]   from Facebook Google yeah and one other company but the Twitter's have
[00:15:06.480 --> 00:15:09.760]   broadcast platform right I mean like probably many inherently so I think
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:14.120]   people know yeah probably not well so pal talk was like apparently really
[00:15:14.120 --> 00:15:18.320]   heavily used during the Arab Spring there's a link to the world there's a
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.840]   link to that so I think we're talking about the rule that they would be broken
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:25.240]   here is that the rule or the law that they can't talk about yeah my my
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:29.880]   understanding yeah my my understanding is that there's there's a there's a law
[00:15:29.880 --> 00:15:34.680]   in within Fiza that says you have to comply and you can't private company
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:39.320]   there's no there's no law that says you have to stand around vigorously denying it
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:44.320]   there's no law that that can tell us it is shut up is what they all said is
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:48.240]   we've never heard of prison so you know it's a buzzword that they didn't hear
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:55.520]   it's the word yeah wait hold on I mean you can't ascribe negative intention to
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:16:00.480]   all the companies involved you can ascribe my negative intention cowards you
[00:16:00.480 --> 00:16:04.280]   can call them cowards you can ascribe negative intention to the government but
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:09.800]   the step you take where you say now everyone is coordinating this legalistic
[00:16:09.800 --> 00:16:15.120]   language to dance around the truth I don't that is the leap to conspiracy
[00:16:15.120 --> 00:16:18.440]   theory okay so here's the part that you can agree with that that where there's
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:25.160]   wrongdoing EFF wrote a really compelling piece on this they apparently in 2011
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:33.440]   the the FISA court apparently found that that the the whole thing was the part
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:39.320]   of this enforcement of this of Fiza was unconstitutional so so EFF filed a
[00:16:39.320 --> 00:16:43.800]   Freedom of Information Act thing to get the details on that and they were
[00:16:43.800 --> 00:16:47.960]   they were blocked by the Obama administration who said no only only the
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:52.080]   Fiza court can release that and then the courts had only just asked me so so
[00:16:52.080 --> 00:16:55.960]   that you have I think we can all agree that there's not enough transparency
[00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:58.960]   about what's I totally agree with that but what I don't agree with and I think
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:03.400]   this is where we're reading these statements and these denials and
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:07.680]   parsing every word is there some hidden meaning there I think that misses the
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:10.720]   point because the point is that we need transparency for the government I think
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:14.680]   that the companies involved are telling us everything that they can and if
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:17.640]   they're not allowed to disclose their participation in some programs I think
[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:21.000]   they're avoiding saying that but I don't think they're actively colluding
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.640]   with the government to hide things I think that is one step too far and I
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:28.680]   think if the EFF isn't afraid of the Obama administration will file lawsuits
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:33.440]   to do things I've I've no ability to understand why Google would be afraid of
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:36.840]   the government if Google could say it and they and they and the worst would
[00:17:36.840 --> 00:17:39.880]   happen and say we get a lawsuit and David you're gonna have to send more time
[00:17:39.880 --> 00:17:42.360]   in the federal courts even to make your mind is he they're either afraid of the
[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:45.660]   government is not afraid I don't think they are I don't either I think they're
[00:17:45.660 --> 00:17:50.240]   colluding they have to be one of the other why would they say why not it's so
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:55.240]   easier it's not a matter of good way they're doing something from a left
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:17:59.940]   field yeah maybe after 9/11 of course remember George Bush started
[00:17:59.940 --> 00:18:03.360]   his secret and by the way no one has existed then right there the warrantless
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:08.760]   wiretap started October 9/11 Facebook and Facebook they have hotmail on them
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:14.560]   they have hydrogen exist to wait do you do a lot of people did isn't it does the
[00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:18.120]   federal government feel like it has wasn't that ever it doesn't the federal
[00:18:18.120 --> 00:18:20.920]   government feel like it has a silent mandate from the American people to
[00:18:20.920 --> 00:18:26.480]   protect it at all costs and if that means monitoring cell phone traffic
[00:18:26.480 --> 00:18:30.880]   particularly traffic from the US overseas if it means monitoring emails
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:36.240]   what's wrong with that that's what I say well here's really I an agreement with
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:40.880]   you yeah here's what here's what's wrong with it here's what's wrong with it so
[00:18:40.880 --> 00:18:45.840]   assuming the assuming the general accusation is accurate that there that
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:49.480]   they're gobbling up all the metadata to find out who's talking to whom and and
[00:18:49.480 --> 00:18:53.680]   then from that they're figuring out what to get a warrant for to go in deep that's
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:58.320]   the accusation and that is clearly unconstitutional the the the fishing
[00:18:58.320 --> 00:19:02.520]   expo is really because the Fourth Amendment specifically talks about you
[00:19:02.520 --> 00:19:05.720]   can do fishing expeditions they can't go to your house to see if there's no
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:08.800]   I agree with that one left again here's what's here's one of the things going on
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:12.520]   according to Benny and I think this is true and if and if you just look at that
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:16.880]   Utah facility that the NSA's bill million square they're going to record
[00:19:16.880 --> 00:19:20.720]   every phone call you've ever made all in real time and they're going to save it
[00:19:20.720 --> 00:19:23.160]   all they're not going to be listening to your calls just like Obama said they're
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:26.720]   going to save every call and then they'll get a warrant when they think of
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:31.000]   something that was because you're a terrorist let's say and they'll be able to
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:34.760]   grab all the old calls they may not even save it and they've they've they're
[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:38.680]   they're re- why not urging ISPs to do this right their trust be supposed to have
[00:19:38.680 --> 00:19:43.280]   18 months of your your head activity they're probably getting help from the
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:46.360]   phone companies is probably being terrified well here's the craziest thing
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:50.200]   about all of this this is this is minority report this is about pre-crime
[00:19:50.200 --> 00:19:55.240]   right they're building their building site psychic like robot genetically
[00:19:55.240 --> 00:19:59.840]   engineered humans in form of computers to prevent crimes before they happen
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:04.520]   it's amazing well I'm not buying this that's what they're trying to do I mean
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:09.440]   I think there is a long history of our government working in cooperation with
[00:20:09.440 --> 00:20:13.680]   the phone companies so the phone I mean like yeah saying their immunity right
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:17.280]   they've given them immunity they've I mean if you pick up a landline phone the
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:21.520]   government has been able to tap that since like the 40s right so and there's
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:25.560]   an expectation I mean it's in popular culture that if you you know people are
[00:20:25.560 --> 00:20:29.560]   using burner phones and the wire because they know that the landlines are tapped
[00:20:29.560 --> 00:20:34.640]   what I what I think is interesting is all of many of the companies well they
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:38.400]   won't say all of them but many of them have publicly said we are not cooperating
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:41.400]   in this way we're only doing what's legally required of us and what the
[00:20:41.400 --> 00:20:45.360]   government has not said is what they deem to be legally required to these
[00:20:45.360 --> 00:20:50.160]   companies and that's that's the only disconnect here is the Google and
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:54.040]   Facebook all this coordinator responses there they're saying what they have to
[00:20:54.040 --> 00:20:56.720]   say they're saying we're doing what's legally required of us and we're doing
[00:20:56.720 --> 00:21:01.400]   our best not overstep that now the question is and that the accusation is
[00:21:01.400 --> 00:21:04.720]   they're doing more and they're not telling you about it and the government
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:07.960]   is demanding more than you think is reasonable and nobody knows if that's
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:11.440]   true was an error to say that they can that the government can watch in real
[00:21:11.440 --> 00:21:15.200]   time your your transit maybe they can I wouldn't mean you got to think somebody
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:20.480]   Google can somebody sure that one search engine that used to have the real
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:26.160]   time searches flying yeah yeah the government so do that for sure but it's
[00:21:26.160 --> 00:21:32.320]   the Chinese government according to IBM every day we create 2.5 quintillion
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:37.640]   bytes of data you just a lot of storage no I rare peak behind
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:41.560]   I had seen this number before and I was trying to find it 90% of the data in
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:44.960]   the world today has been created in the last two years alone so you may be
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:49.400]   better have a big heart big ass hard drive yeah milli-barfita servers 2.5
[00:21:49.400 --> 00:21:54.840]   quintillion bytes I think I mean Google has the entire Internet stored and the
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:58.200]   State Department had the Internet in a box which is most of the Internet stored
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:22:06.680]   in a suitcase 12 terabytes of tweets a day 12 let's leave those out so much
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:10.880]   valuable information in those I had a really good sandwich this morning yeah
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:15.360]   yeah yeah in regards to the metadata one of the tell an anecdote which I've told
[00:22:15.360 --> 00:22:22.340]   before I tell it again in the 90s this was going on I was in London at a PC
[00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:26.080]   magazine UK event where we were being shown certain kinds of new technologies
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:30.120]   that were being developed by Interpol and Interpol showed this is a network
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:33.440]   analysis they showed here's what we can do we can take all these phone calls
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:36.840]   all these phone calls the metadata who called who how long it lasted in the
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:41.440]   rest of it and we and then he showed us this this crazy network map he says we
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:46.120]   can spot a crime boss using this data because we can see who's you know just
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:49.480]   based on the way they call each other and how long the calls last currently
[00:22:49.480 --> 00:22:53.440]   it's only five points of data needed to to actually identify somebody so by the
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:57.240]   way this surprise kind of metadata and we we had a piece our one of our writers
[00:22:57.240 --> 00:23:01.440]   Josh cops and we're a great pieces metadata is dangerous right and it's and
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:04.920]   argued by the government as something that does not require warrant right
[00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:08.920]   right there portal every cell company has a portal for law enforcement of any
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:12.600]   kind for a buck 50 to find out where you are right but the phone companies again
[00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:16.080]   the phone companies if you want to talk about they don't fight at all
[00:23:16.080 --> 00:23:20.200]   collude with the government yeah I mean well AT&T was granted a monopoly on
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:24.600]   building infrastructure in this company and and great change as long as they
[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:28.560]   continue to right so I mean like so but remember echelon remember we talk for
[00:23:28.560 --> 00:23:32.320]   a long time building still in San Francisco echelon was never admitted to
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:36.280]   by the United States but was admitted to by the British government as a as a
[00:23:36.280 --> 00:23:40.160]   joint program of Australia Canada New Zealand the UK and the US to basically
[00:23:40.160 --> 00:23:46.280]   scan all electronic signal which means email phones everything for keywords yeah
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:53.560]   you say hummus and bomb in the same sentence boom boom no but a terrorist
[00:23:53.560 --> 00:24:00.360]   favorite type of hummus it's delicious yeah it's a bomb
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:05.720]   oh yeah we're all going to hell one of the other is it true that there's no
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:09.320]   extradition from Hong Kong is absolutely not true I don't know why this guy's
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:13.360]   there so here's your art here's my I think they were no conspiracy go if you
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:17.760]   don't just I don't okay Leo you know I was a copywriter you think I know
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:23.400]   you can look it up I think Paraguay I think our team I think you I maybe
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:28.680]   you're a good I think but here's it here's my Maccafees there yeah yeah believe
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:32.360]   also has like the babes which is why Maccafees yeah and if you don't give the
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:35.280]   government enough money you can get in trouble I did a post on this that I
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:38.400]   think somehow the Chinese government has got to be behind the leak and the
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:42.680]   timing of the leak because it was so beautiful for them Obama was just scheduled
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:46.800]   to go take a good point the premier of China the president of China out on the
[00:24:46.800 --> 00:24:50.640]   carpet but they're hiking spank them you can be the backup guy for no agenda
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:54.840]   it's but it's just timing is perfect either it's either I mean this thing has
[00:24:54.840 --> 00:24:59.200]   been this stuff has been going on for years and the story breaks three days
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:03.560]   before Obama's about the lecture the him about hacking he had to respond to it
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:12.760]   while he's talking to Chinese premier yeah but again rises to the yeah I mean
[00:25:12.760 --> 00:25:17.560]   I think there's just a lot of fodder here yeah all I want to know here's what I
[00:25:17.560 --> 00:25:21.320]   want to know can the government look at my Google search queries as I type and
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:26.680]   why do you care and why do you care I mean like that I care about do you care I
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:31.640]   think that leads look our lives are now led online right there right holy led
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:34.360]   online shouldn't you just pretend that is an impermissible in the United
[00:25:34.360 --> 00:25:38.840]   public no the same way you shouldn't it's only everything you do in your home is
[00:25:38.840 --> 00:25:42.920]   public I mean that there is no what you like searching for and we yeah well I've
[00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:47.280]   searched for a lot of super yeah let's just be clear you know the only thing
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:50.400]   that anybody's ever said in regards to this the only risk that I've ever
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:53.600]   anybody's ever mentioned is that insurance companies might deny you
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:58.360]   insurance because you search for donuts that's not the risk that is the risk is
[00:25:58.360 --> 00:26:02.200]   that we we pride ourselves in this country on on freedom expression on
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:06.520]   freedom of thought on radical innovation right this whole valley around us is
[00:26:06.520 --> 00:26:11.280]   pride in weird ideas becoming reality right and if we are constantly monitoring
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:15.480]   everyone we will clamp down that there will be a chilling effect and you cannot
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:19.040]   tell me and we have I think we've actually done a disservice to ourselves
[00:26:19.040 --> 00:26:22.200]   as participants in like the tech community you can't tell me where the
[00:26:22.200 --> 00:26:26.040]   line between your offline life and your online life begins and where that
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:28.800]   boundary should be and where it is for everyone we don't talk about it because
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:32.720]   it's it's not it's not important quite frankly right it's only important now
[00:26:32.720 --> 00:26:35.640]   when the government is watching everything you do in one part of your life
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:39.680]   and there's an entire set of restrictions and so the other side
[00:26:39.680 --> 00:26:43.480]   practically really why is it a chilling effect what are you gonna not search
[00:26:43.480 --> 00:26:47.000]   for something because the government's collecting your searches it depends on
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:51.240]   presumably you're on the TV and Google start now Leo and for the next couple
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:56.240]   weeks search for IED you share everything you do in factoring no why
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:26:59.680]   because it's public same as anything else I do on the internet would you
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:07.360]   search for IEDs no okay was that a chilling effect yeah what I said that
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:12.400]   you wouldn't I would search for IEDs if I wanted to know about IEDs why is it
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:15.360]   that you would come knocking on my door because I search for IED I think so
[00:27:15.360 --> 00:27:19.040]   well I think we should all search for IEDs and just over a little bit
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:23.280]   that I just did it and I'm on your network
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:31.440]   well let's all do it then right as well why wait I don't understand why would
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:35.360]   you why do you feel less comfortable posting but is there any in public for
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:39.560]   you on Facebook is what network of your fans and people are valid your wealth
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:43.200]   do you have the evidence that the government is now going out and
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:46.760]   prosecuting evidence of any because of their it's actually my my big problem
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:50.040]   here's I don't have evidence but like because I have a I have no I have
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:52.840]   four sides of a PowerPoint deck no I understand but there's no example
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:56.880]   right now of somebody go the government knocking on your door because of your
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:28:00.720]   Google searches I think there are many many examples through history that's
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:06.200]   overzealous in history I actions because I agree but we don't but are you saying
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:09.680]   no in the United States of America you know we have a high a high rate of
[00:28:09.680 --> 00:28:13.440]   false accusations you have a high rate of like people being killed like you
[00:28:13.440 --> 00:28:16.280]   know executed for crimes I didn't commit like right higher than we should
[00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:20.560]   right why would we allow the government to start monitoring everything like unless
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:24.240]   you can prove to me that law enforcement this country is perfect which maybe
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:27.480]   you have no I can't so how do you so how do you buy what I give them the
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:31.800]   benefit of how do you balance the need for security which I guess we after 9/11
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:36.640]   we'd agree we need something I think we just I mean it's the same as a look the
[00:28:36.640 --> 00:28:39.040]   fourth amendment in fifth amendment conversations country is not like a
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:42.880]   new conversation right so long stay what's new about it is it's happening
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:47.520]   online now right and the the technology community has long said don't regulate
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:51.720]   the United say the hell away right so was like SISPA we you and I got in a
[00:28:51.720 --> 00:28:55.680]   big argument so but once once right those we shout down these laws instead
[00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:58.800]   of saying what they should be and how they should work and that was your
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:29:02.040]   position was that instead of trying to say no so but we should come up with a
[00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:04.600]   good law yeah we should come up with something that works that balances our
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:08.720]   interest correctly right what we in because we because that's not happening
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:13.200]   we employ spy this taxpayers in the United States America we employ thousands
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:17.080]   upon thousands of spies right they are meant to do spying well and they're gonna
[00:29:17.080 --> 00:29:19.920]   figure it out and that's whether or not we give them the tools or not what we
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.880]   need to do is give them the tools and set the limits transparently which we're
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:29.000]   not to certainly the benefit of this kind of discussion is at least this for the
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:32.960]   first time some discussion about this and transparency right now I suspect
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:36.680]   there's no transparency I apologize that's the wrong word but we there's a call
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:41.120]   for transparency from yes federal government and I know the tech companies
[00:29:41.120 --> 00:29:44.440]   and from the tech companies and I think we should continue that call and the
[00:29:44.440 --> 00:29:48.360]   discussion should be had how much security do we want how much privacy are
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:51.800]   we willing to give up I think that's legitimate yeah I think that's completely
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:56.140]   legitimate but I fear it won't and what I'm very concerned about right now
[00:29:56.140 --> 00:29:59.480]   WWDC ever is going to talk about the new shiny thing yeah and they're gonna talk
[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:02.880]   about the sky they're gonna talk about Edward Snowden and I think that is
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:07.360]   really so you think he's been he's been pushed forward as a hero right I'm
[00:30:07.360 --> 00:30:10.360]   watching my tweet stream well he's either Bradley Manning or is you know he's
[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:13.360]   Bradley Manning he's either a hero or a goat depending right I'm even watching
[00:30:13.360 --> 00:30:16.880]   the chatroom you don't think you could be a trader some you don't think you
[00:30:16.880 --> 00:30:20.880]   could be a plant you think there is a battle going on between the CIA and the
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:25.360]   NSA it's pretty apparent and he is a XCIA this doesn't make any sense to me at
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:29.280]   all I should hang out with you more you're very interesting oh he is interesting
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:32.400]   is the word now this doesn't know it's in the show every Tuesday Thursdays and
[00:30:32.400 --> 00:30:38.240]   Sundays I don't think I mean the amount of collusion and then so then Glen
[00:30:38.240 --> 00:30:42.200]   Greenwald fell for the plan right I mean like I didn't say that that to me is
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:46.960]   just you don't think it's possible I do you think it's not possible for an XCIA
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:51.840]   guy who went to work for Boozell and still has contacts at the agency to go in as
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:54.700]   a contractor the NSA and then blow this out of the water to embarrass the
[00:30:54.700 --> 00:30:58.840]   NSA I don't think you don't think it's possible and I think more things are
[00:30:58.840 --> 00:31:03.600]   more I think things are life is more chaotic and she's being unplanned in that
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:07.400]   here's the can you say that I don't think so it's not work out that way here's
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:10.720]   the thing that I think everybody should be playing everybody should be focusing
[00:31:10.720 --> 00:31:14.680]   on the fact that the decision about that balance between security and privacy
[00:31:14.680 --> 00:31:19.640]   shouldn't be made by behind closed doors I mean we're finding out about
[00:31:19.640 --> 00:31:23.200]   something that's been going on for years right so essentially our government has
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:27.040]   kind of like and they only counter argument they have is well if we tell
[00:31:27.040 --> 00:31:30.280]   you how you're spying on us you'll find a new way to hide you know it's like well
[00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:33.960]   yes we make decisions all the time like if you really want to save lives
[00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:38.120]   ban cars we'd save thousands and thousands of lives but we don't make that
[00:31:38.120 --> 00:31:43.080]   choice we decide about 40 of cars is worth the fatalities 40,000 a year yeah
[00:31:43.080 --> 00:31:48.080]   it's huge even the TSA like this is this happened to me today so I I'm a
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:52.720]   brown man when I fly with a bag full of wires quite frequently so I'm often
[00:31:52.720 --> 00:31:58.640]   I'm often you get I got I got stopped I entered Turkey with a bet with a with a
[00:31:58.640 --> 00:32:02.440]   kilo of white tea which looks just like dope man I tell you I was thinking about
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:06.480]   that what I'm gonna get some tea yeah yeah yes press whatever it was horrible
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:10.040]   well no so today in this in this event I've been flying a lot recently and we
[00:32:10.040 --> 00:32:13.400]   doing a lot of live logging live logging ww C more and we have batteries for our
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:16.680]   computers so I have two of them I bag and every time I fight these batteries
[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:19.880]   the TSA stops me asking a bunch of questions like you know they hold up
[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:22.920]   the battery and then they tell me how to repack it so I won't get stopped
[00:32:22.920 --> 00:32:30.800]   and I'm like this is he actually put a velcroed badge that says security on
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:34.240]   his backpack yeah he says I never get searched anymore really yeah that's
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:37.840]   fine your in security yeah every every down there that and it's funny because
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:40.360]   the vice always different I put at the bottom then we can't see and we can't
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:42.720]   see it and then we can't see it or then they're like put it at the top so you
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:46.680]   can definitely see I can top that story I went to the airport one time and I went
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:49.480]   up to the person right before security and I want I asked him do you want a
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:54.040]   CID and she didn't quite hear me she heard CID CID is the acronym for people
[00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:58.560]   who are carrying weapons she said yeah okay just go around she thought I had
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:04.800]   a loaded gun just yeah go ahead wow yes that's the topic
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:09.080]   I thought I could have she thought she thought she was an air marshal oh like
[00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:13.320]   in bridesmaids you look like a human rights you do you know actually does he
[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:16.960]   looks totally like an air marshal yeah you need to have a little I have been
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:22.000]   that's kind of built in yeah all the time watch your ass divorce he has a nice
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:26.520]   erect posture yeah he looks he looks manly I would say your government age
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:30.040]   got a close cropped hair yeah you don't need anything you should do that
[00:33:30.040 --> 00:33:34.080]   every time so where's my gun yeah yeah you don't need a gun just flash your
[00:33:34.080 --> 00:33:40.160]   wallet I'm with I'm with I'm with a very funny Marshall Marshall he was a
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:43.280]   Marshall by the way yes he was yes yeah it's not forget it's great
[00:33:43.280 --> 00:33:50.440]   scene yeah let that be a lesson to us all right we've gotten over this I think
[00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:53.640]   we're gonna move on yes I'm gonna move on but is there anybody wants to offer a
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:57.120]   bottom line to this my bottom line is you should assume you're being watched
[00:33:57.120 --> 00:34:00.360]   yeah and you should listen to the last no agenda show where Adam Curry comes up
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:05.760]   the concept that's all about Adobe Adobe figure that one out folks Adobe the
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:09.720]   software company I'm done with I am done with he finally agrees with Apple
[00:34:09.720 --> 00:34:14.080]   they're building yeah right that's a station that for years no they're
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:17.640]   building the NSA facility in Utah with they're working with Adobe you're
[00:34:17.640 --> 00:34:22.320]   kidding that's all just give an atom or ammunition they're using
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:26.920]   presentation could have used some real help from it yeah some real cleaning up
[00:34:26.920 --> 00:34:31.360]   through it together yeah auto desk you worry about them no all right I love
[00:34:31.360 --> 00:34:37.960]   I don't trust Photoshop no is it a job be a sponsor for the show is that you're
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:43.240]   about to go into the yeah unfortunately every one of our sponsors is a cloud
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:47.320]   company of course you have you asked that just like they provide direct access
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:51.080]   I'm sorry everything's a cloud company everything is though I mean we we couldn't
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:55.040]   have a sponsor Ford was not a cloud company they are one yes sink is a cloud
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:59.600]   crap nobody know where you're driving that's why actually to back you up and
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:02.600]   I'm not being seizures now that is a chilling effect right because nobody
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:08.160]   trusts online anymore yeah I don't but I've been saying that for years with a
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:12.080]   glint in your eye no no I've been I've said that they should shut down the
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:20.240]   Internet popular notion yeah is it not reasonable yeah really that we're not
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:24.120]   gonna have much of a show there's no isn't not reasonable do good or bad just
[00:35:24.120 --> 00:35:29.240]   assume that you know Skype or Facebook or Google what you're doing is not in
[00:35:29.240 --> 00:35:31.720]   private well they're being the arguments for these companies it's funny
[00:35:31.720 --> 00:35:34.440]   because these companies have been having arguments around the world for years
[00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:37.440]   so we've been laughing at right like India wants to shut down blackberry
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:43.000]   messenger mmm-hmm Saudi Arabia to shut on fiber like right if these companies
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.040]   don't comply is that what they're scared almost certain that Microsoft put a
[00:35:46.040 --> 00:35:48.840]   backdoor in Skype I mean I don't think there's any doubt I don't know they've
[00:35:48.840 --> 00:35:52.480]   only on Skype for the you know handphones first thing they did they showed up they
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:57.920]   can code that bomber shut up he's like I brought this door I questioned the
[00:35:57.920 --> 00:36:00.960]   fact that window
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:09.320]   I know I would if I were a political dissident I probably wouldn't use Skype
[00:36:09.320 --> 00:36:16.000]   to call my right are there not good ways to obscure everything you're doing do
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.960]   we not have good encryption technology that frankly is widespread and well
[00:36:19.960 --> 00:36:24.440]   known no we don't not that's why it's written and well-known the problem is
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:28.640]   that the drug dealers and the terrorists and the security nerds all use that
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:32.960]   stuff and then 99% of the population does it yeah I spoke to that was one of the
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:38.000]   first people I spoke to on Friday was an encryption specialist he was a I
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.200]   forget that at Colorado University a computer science specialist and he was
[00:36:42.200 --> 00:36:45.560]   saying you know that's what needs to happen here if people want to if people
[00:36:45.560 --> 00:36:48.400]   want to take precautions that's what they have to do and I was like well how
[00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:52.280]   easy is that for people to do and he started going through services and I'm
[00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:55.400]   a tech editor and I that does not even sound like something I could know the
[00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:58.680]   only person to be the only person is going to do it is somebody who has a
[00:36:58.680 --> 00:37:04.680]   strong interest in not being spied upon in other words a crook
[00:37:04.680 --> 00:37:13.920]   well but that's the point and so really why would you use encryption if
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:17.240]   you're not doing anything wrong actually governor official said that he said if
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:21.160]   you're not going to have nothing to fear yeah actually get when you get elected
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:24.120]   and often they should just hand you a plaque that you put on your office wall
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:28.480]   that says never ever say if you're not doing anything wrong you have nothing
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:31.600]   to fear if you have any position of authority you are not allowed to say
[00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:35.800]   that like that's just not the line that our Constitution is drawn yeah and there
[00:37:35.800 --> 00:37:38.680]   are many reasons why you wouldn't want other people listening to conversations
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:42.280]   and some of them are stupid right maybe you're just having a stupid
[00:37:42.280 --> 00:37:46.040]   conversation for a long time I hate dude I hate plugging my Spotify into
[00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:50.800]   Facebook because sometimes I listen to dumb music like why why should that should
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:54.280]   be the standard we could find out I want to make it public we could find out
[00:37:54.280 --> 00:38:00.200]   for example that you're a Minnesota Vikings fan yeah by the way that
[00:38:00.200 --> 00:38:10.840]   conspiracy is less likely than you should be talking to my for a long time
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:14.280]   law enforcement I know this from talking over and I at the Secret Service
[00:38:14.280 --> 00:38:17.600]   just assume crooks are dumb yeah Secret Service would say we don't worry about
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:20.800]   encryption they always give us the password anyway you know they just say
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:27.480]   what's the password well monkey one two three it's not but I don't think that we
[00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:30.880]   can assume that any I think they're starting to worry yeah that these means
[00:38:30.880 --> 00:38:34.080]   of encryption are becoming widespread and well enough known and easy enough to
[00:38:34.080 --> 00:38:37.720]   use frankly that bad guys might start using them and now we got a problem
[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:41.440]   right yeah and that's that's exactly what's can happen I mean that the value
[00:38:41.440 --> 00:38:44.320]   should we be worried well I haven't forbid that law enforcement actually do
[00:38:44.320 --> 00:38:47.120]   some real police work like they used to do before he had any of these
[00:38:47.120 --> 00:38:50.200]   so it's going to be an arms race you know technical arms race back and forth
[00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:55.400]   and you know part in this mix somewhere the public has the right to sort of
[00:38:55.400 --> 00:38:58.960]   push back on encroachments and privacy and stuff like that so there's multiple
[00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:02.560]   things happening once but yeah absolutely the sophisticated criminals the most
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:06.640]   dangerous ones are going to use good encryption and yes the governments are
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:10.320]   going to see the use of encryption as evidence that there's wrongdoing and
[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:14.320]   that's not right and so on so this is going on but I hope the conversation
[00:39:14.320 --> 00:39:18.800]   keep hearing this phrase what is real good example you know they use is as an
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:23.360]   example this guy who is doing the would have on the New York subways and see
[00:39:23.360 --> 00:39:26.520]   these email intercepts it turned out really it was pretty much standard
[00:39:26.520 --> 00:39:29.360]   police work that caught this okay what what do that I can't remember I read
[00:39:29.360 --> 00:39:33.280]   the article but it wasn't it wasn't electronic interception you know going
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:37.680]   and asking people what happened getting witnesses taking you know so that that
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:41.080]   to me sounds like the fingerprinting job or that wasn't electronic in your
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:44.400]   step but that but that is just a careful and facetious collection of
[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:48.960]   evidence and compliance right work but but if you live half or more of your
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:52.240]   life online right you need to be able to do that type of police work with the
[00:39:52.240 --> 00:39:58.040]   data and the communication you have online so this is exactly though I agree
[00:39:58.040 --> 00:40:01.400]   and I think this is exactly the fear online all day what are you gonna be
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:04.400]   doing you're not out there shooting back guys go online now yeah they do they
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:07.400]   I know you see some of the trolls in our chat yeah
[00:40:07.400 --> 00:40:12.960]   that the wow all of your criminal that's so sorry I never used to be a
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:18.120]   right here it comes haven't but I mean I think there's a reasonable fear that
[00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:21.360]   people are going to start using things like this crypto cat which gives you
[00:40:21.360 --> 00:40:27.520]   complete trans you know complete a privacy and I am crypto crypto dot CAT
[00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:31.760]   Steve Gibson talked about this vetted it completely strong encryption during your
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:35.120]   chat so I'm chatting with somebody and I'm using crypto cat what's he using
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:38.640]   crypto cat oh you both sides have to use this I remember years ago I installed
[00:40:38.640 --> 00:40:42.080]   PGP and started setting up my signature and saying encouraging people to encrypt
[00:40:42.080 --> 00:40:46.280]   their email back and forth nobody did it of course not I know he's gonna do this
[00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:52.280]   either well but bad guys well they have a better logo it's a good logo it's an
[00:40:52.280 --> 00:40:56.200]   eight bit logo no you squint your eyes it's better let me have some more port
[00:40:56.200 --> 00:41:01.440]   you'll feel better go to my PC let's talk about it GOTOMYPC.com
[00:41:01.440 --> 00:41:03.440]   just the wrong that's a terrible
[00:41:03.440 --> 00:41:09.440]   great segue it's SSL maybe you want to talk about shifting that it's secure you
[00:41:09.440 --> 00:41:14.240]   know what stams.com say you're at a internet cafe and you're surfing around
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:18.000]   and you're worried about people spying on you what do you do you just open up
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.560]   your your iPad your iPhone your Android device your laptop you log into your go
[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:26.320]   to my PC account now the whole transaction is SSL encrypted strong
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:30.640]   encryption all the way back to the server back to your office now I can't
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:33.680]   help you if your office is being spied upon but that's another matter entirely
[00:41:33.680 --> 00:41:39.040]   go to my PC is actually quite amazing a lot of people use it for as a VPN
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:42.880]   almost it's also of course a great way to be at work without being at work in a
[00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:46.400]   summertime this is such a nice thing to have you can still be productive get
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:52.120]   stuff done and escape the office there's always something to do right go to my
[00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:56.560]   PC from Citrix secure remote access to a Mac or a PC you could send and receive
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:42:03.600]   email access any file even on the network you can run any program even if it's
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:06.880]   not installed on your mobile device I like go to my PC I know you'll love it
[00:42:06.880 --> 00:42:10.640]   and for 30 days you could try it free go to my PC.com actually this is a way to

[00:42:24.160 --> 00:42:30.480]   very happy with it. Now you know let's move on but I just I feel like the we're
[00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:34.880]   gonna hear a lot more over the next week about prism what should people be
[00:42:34.880 --> 00:42:42.720]   looking for what are the key phrases what do we want do we want do we want the
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:47.080]   president to engage in a conversation about what should I have to learn when
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:51.840]   to shut up yeah well he said he would listen and he met it to everybody all
[00:42:51.840 --> 00:42:57.920]   the time. I think that's what we want right we want our members of Congress to
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:43:01.040]   speak up as they have Mark Whiden has and a few others. Well you know it's
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:06.640]   funny about the Congress. Whiden and John McCain today said I don't think we
[00:43:06.640 --> 00:43:10.400]   need to brief all 535 members of Congress on everything that the
[00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:14.120]   intelligence community does that's why we have committees right so like that's
[00:43:14.120 --> 00:43:18.560]   very the intelligence committee gets briefed right but I mean we're not as the
[00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:21.760]   American public I think if we should keep on the intelligence committees are
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:24.760]   saying we don't want to brief 500 people in Congress right I don't know if
[00:43:24.760 --> 00:43:27.640]   they're gonna brief 800 million people in the United States. Well we are in a
[00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:30.440]   representative we're in a representative we're not in a full of
[00:43:30.440 --> 00:43:33.120]   democracy we're representative I would like my representative to know what
[00:43:33.120 --> 00:43:37.000]   that was going on yeah it is as a first step well that's what people should do
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:39.920]   they should write their member of Congress they should say we want it's
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:44.640]   not good for the for the polity of this nation it's not good for innovation it's
[00:43:44.640 --> 00:43:48.240]   not good for the internet for this kind of activity to go on it has a chilling
[00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:53.200]   effect and I would like you to call for more openness more transparency to
[00:43:53.200 --> 00:43:58.400]   participate in the conversation overturn the Patriot Act stop these NSL's these
[00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:01.920]   national security letters and and protect the Fourth Amendment how about
[00:44:01.920 --> 00:44:06.840]   that that be good are you gonna do that Leo no the EFF is gonna do that so if
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:10.640]   you want to if you want to go to EFF dot com there on the right side of this and
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:15.800]   there gets an act activism I can't remember the story unfolds I think we
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:19.720]   need to see the Guardian and the post and now the times get involved yep we
[00:44:19.720 --> 00:44:23.320]   need to see them build have they done a good job there it is stop mass surveillance
[00:44:23.320 --> 00:44:28.000]   till Congress yeah EFF dot org I mean the EFF is it you know they do a very good
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.520]   job of promoting their causes but they need that the journalists to see their
[00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:36.720]   take action now now this is really important because they're gonna go buy
[00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:41.120]   your zip code I would say the best thing to do is snail mail or a phone call to
[00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:44.240]   your member on cause risk they're very effective they log them on you Skype
[00:44:44.240 --> 00:44:51.280]   though actually you sky for that one yeah I know you're listening I got a message
[00:44:51.280 --> 00:44:55.160]   actually the the mail is the best way and I should mention by the way this this
[00:44:55.160 --> 00:45:01.340]   idea of canning the whole USPS be in favor of electronic stuff just gets
[00:45:01.340 --> 00:45:05.840]   rid of all those great laws that they keep the mail safe from people snooping
[00:45:05.840 --> 00:45:10.000]   on it male is male has protections in electronic it has tons of protections
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.720]   you can't defraud somebody with a bad contract or some scam over the mail you
[00:45:14.720 --> 00:45:19.000]   can do it with FedEx and there's and there's all the mail systems very
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:24.080]   important and why we need to keep cash as well and people by the way if you
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:28.520]   send them a letter it gets a lot more of it really nailed I mean these guys pay
[00:45:28.520 --> 00:45:31.440]   more attention because they're all timers they get a letter oh my god what
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:34.440]   does this person say because you went through trouble right to make a letter
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:37.880]   yes the more you're trying to just crank out some crap and hit the return
[00:45:37.880 --> 00:45:40.720]   well it also verifies that you're a constituent that you're you're writing
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:45.600]   from there right even though you can you could fake that just drive but then you
[00:45:45.600 --> 00:45:51.040]   really care that means you really can maybe all right so we should be watching
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:56.040]   for that I'm do you think Neil I that the the Guardian and the post have done a
[00:45:56.040 --> 00:46:00.600]   good job here I think they did raise a lot of questions there's a lot of
[00:46:00.600 --> 00:46:06.640]   questions I think right now they're in there in a phase that troubles me where
[00:46:06.640 --> 00:46:11.800]   it appears to be you were advocacy yeah not backing down I think they're I
[00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:15.160]   think they're they're they're rhetoric has stepped up right interesting they're
[00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:18.040]   saying we've got more we got these bombshells you should all be afraid right
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:21.800]   and I have not seeing the the evidence I'm not seeing the bombshells let's see
[00:46:21.800 --> 00:46:26.920]   the rest of the day I'm seeing this poor kid Edward Snowden right and they're I
[00:46:26.920 --> 00:46:30.800]   he's not evidence he's an available data point and everything else is behind
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:35.920]   closed door so right and I we'll see what happens the rest this week but I
[00:46:35.920 --> 00:46:41.400]   will say that the revelation of who this guy was today didn't strike me is
[00:46:41.400 --> 00:46:45.920]   some like we won and I've seen a lot of like he's a hero we won the government's
[00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:49.360]   wrong he's just a guy with a PowerPoint deck and they need it they need more
[00:46:49.360 --> 00:46:53.760]   than I want to see the rest of that deck yep yeah yeah I mean that's that's we
[00:46:53.760 --> 00:46:56.080]   want to push the government transparency we should probably push the Guardian
[00:46:56.080 --> 00:47:00.200]   could have April fools at the very end for all we know want to know where I can
[00:47:00.200 --> 00:47:04.240]   get some of that clip art I think it's signed Adam Craig which is
[00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:09.080]   kind of a surprise I yeah didn't expect that how many of you have porn on your
[00:47:09.080 --> 00:47:14.680]   Google Glass nobody because they're not paying a job Anna she's got her
[00:47:14.680 --> 00:47:20.720]   they banned they banned the actual glass so casual glass batteries dead I like
[00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:24.320]   dead look yeah it's like a headband it's the most expensive headband in the world
[00:47:24.320 --> 00:47:29.400]   yeah $1,500 had been it's not even symmetric no no it's super
[00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:34.600]   fashionable now I'm gonna wear this to WWC tomorrow yeah I love that but like
[00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:40.160]   that I think I'll let you in with it Apple has such a good sense of humor so
[00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:46.200]   some porn company my candy m double eye candy with a K yep dot com right
[00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:54.400]   one okay okay made a website where it's supposedly all POV porn from Google
[00:47:54.400 --> 00:48:00.760]   Glass except I bet it's not it's not it's just it's just a porn site Google
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:05.520]   immediately said no we don't allow porn software it wasn't that you were
[00:48:05.520 --> 00:48:08.280]   looking at porn on that little screen because that wouldn't be much fun well
[00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:14.480]   it was actually it was yeah I followed the story pretty closely that's gonna
[00:48:14.480 --> 00:48:23.840]   come off wrong as long as it did hey oh hey I'm sorry baby I just couldn't
[00:48:23.840 --> 00:48:28.000]   stop myself I was gonna be on YouTube for sure
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:33.360]   can't wait came off just right baby so this company I'm gonna explain a little
[00:48:33.360 --> 00:48:37.240]   bit of the back story I was on the phone with the CEO a couple of my candy
[00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:40.720]   from yes the CEO of my candy and the other founder it's just a sleazy
[00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:44.400]   grab right but but actually the interesting thing is is that there wasn't
[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:49.680]   a clause in the Google Glass developers I guess it's kind of their terms of
[00:48:49.680 --> 00:48:55.080]   service now that there that you it wasn't in there before it is now it is yeah so
[00:48:55.080 --> 00:49:00.080]   this this company came out with it it was supposed to be both they were offering
[00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:04.680]   some so it's a content and then they were allowing glass owners to take photos
[00:49:04.680 --> 00:49:09.120]   and up right then and so then the they clamped down there I guess they're also
[00:49:09.120 --> 00:49:14.360]   had their API limit revoked or their API token and and Google's quite right
[00:49:14.360 --> 00:49:17.560]   and now they're trying to actually craft it out that doesn't that takes out
[00:49:17.560 --> 00:49:21.560]   I was going right in this because it's the last thing you want people to start
[00:49:21.560 --> 00:49:25.840]   doing with glass who cares I mean they have this already for Android I mean
[00:49:25.840 --> 00:49:30.520]   they do they don't allow they don't allow so they don't have worn in the
[00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:35.200]   yeah that was the whole thing Steve Jobs said he said to that wired writer or
[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:39.120]   the gawk writer if you want porn go look at Android right well but they don't
[00:49:39.120 --> 00:49:42.800]   allow it in the store they don't let it in the place to yeah okay I allow you to
[00:49:42.800 --> 00:49:46.200]   like get a third party that's actually what this company does company allows
[00:49:46.200 --> 00:49:50.200]   you to put an app store that's that what they do their apps they're an app store
[00:49:50.200 --> 00:49:55.080]   that lets you get more porn content from I think that the other thing this kind
[00:49:55.080 --> 00:49:59.920]   of odd was their refusal to let you do the face recognition thing on the Google
[00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:04.520]   glass yeah why why because it's a new Larry page Google they're they're they're
[00:50:04.520 --> 00:50:08.920]   very sort of arbitrary about certain things like if you like a Google question
[00:50:08.920 --> 00:50:12.680]   I don't want to screw it up they're trying to avoid becoming they want look
[00:50:12.680 --> 00:50:16.800]   they're working on this problem and they were gonna bring it
[00:50:16.800 --> 00:50:20.040]   charge no no I think they're also trying to be really sensitive here they they
[00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:23.360]   know there's so much attention to privacy around this there's so many I
[00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:26.720]   mean everywhere from the government to independent app makers are all worried
[00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:29.960]   about this because they don't want their app and their their stuff to be seen as
[00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:34.160]   as in approaching on your privacy and they are trying to say okay we're not
[00:50:34.160 --> 00:50:37.200]   gonna allow that right now right right and also I mean it's not gonna ever come
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:41.160]   I think it's just right now when you wear when you wear a glass everybody
[00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:45.520]   assumes it's on all the time that's already invading is our eyes right and I
[00:50:45.520 --> 00:50:49.160]   I think Google just wants to they want to they want to they're gonna get there
[00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:52.520]   I mean I've got a bigger there's gonna come a point when Google flips a switch
[00:50:52.520 --> 00:50:56.320]   and the glass camera is on all the time talking to Google it has to you don't
[00:50:56.320 --> 00:50:59.880]   build that unless that's the end game really I think you're calling these other
[00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:03.640]   people conspiracists that's the craziest thing I've ever heard well the
[00:51:03.640 --> 00:51:08.520]   reason that you would do it is so that I drop dead well I yeah but I think that's
[00:51:08.520 --> 00:51:12.600]   the craziest thing you've ever heard yeah but the reason I do that you don't do
[00:51:12.600 --> 00:51:16.800]   it's a mistake you don't do it so that camera can give Google stuff you do it
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:20.480]   so the display can give you stuff right right and that's that's the end game for
[00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:24.440]   glasses the display is about battery technology it's gonna do that well yes
[00:51:24.440 --> 00:51:28.880]   I agree with you and I'd like to actually do object recognition before they did
[00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:32.800]   facial well they will do that Google goggles did that right you can right
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:36.520]   that's what I want I actually like kind of reviewed these I haven't wanted to
[00:51:36.520 --> 00:51:39.920]   review them but I did a piece earlier this week about how I wanted to return
[00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:43.760]   these okay class what the hell am I eating yeah right exactly what am I
[00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:46.960]   eating or I want to look at the subway station and know you know when is the
[00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:50.200]   next train coming yes before having to go down that's the kind of stuff that
[00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:54.000]   would make me wear these and not keep my bag right why do you not want to
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:57.640]   review them because I mean they're not done you know no normal people can't
[00:51:57.640 --> 00:52:02.400]   buy these I'm not that you guys aren't normal
[00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:06.400]   audience of non-normal but I mean knowing you can't buy these not gonna cost
[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:10.080]   fifteen hundred dollars when they really do come out but on the other hand I did
[00:52:10.080 --> 00:52:13.120]   pay fifteen hundred dollars for these and I wanted to return them where yours
[00:52:13.120 --> 00:52:21.680]   Leo where yours Jason how you did get him yes and Jason has a newborn and I
[00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:25.160]   thought a much better person to have a glass and I frankly I would wear them
[00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:28.880]   for one day and then it would be that's how I've been he did he did a tweet that
[00:52:28.880 --> 00:52:33.080]   said if I had glass I would give him to Jason Howell and I said it no I bought
[00:52:33.080 --> 00:52:37.440]   him last year at the Google I am and no I think I think Jason's a better
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:40.720]   person and he also hosts are all about Android show and all of that a lot of
[00:52:40.720 --> 00:52:43.560]   people have actually said to me I bet you would wear them a lot more if you had
[00:52:43.560 --> 00:52:47.840]   children yeah well the Google people yeah I mean people when I put my article
[00:52:47.840 --> 00:52:50.520]   up on Friday people like I bet that wouldn't be true and I met some people
[00:52:50.520 --> 00:52:53.520]   this guy over here he says it wears it all the time doesn't want to be without
[00:52:53.520 --> 00:52:56.960]   it what what do you do what do you do with his tool them he's a developer does
[00:52:56.960 --> 00:53:02.920]   you do he runs a porn site there's some adjacent pictures that's his
[00:53:02.920 --> 00:53:09.280]   daughter Lucy right and a kid peeing on the sidewalk but what is great about
[00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:12.640]   glass with a baby is the babies looking at you while you're taking a picture
[00:53:12.640 --> 00:53:16.280]   instead of a camera surprise and so you get runoff screaming thinking you're a
[00:53:16.280 --> 00:53:20.000]   board they're not that big I don't think a baby knows they just think daddy has
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   big they run off screaming you take them off they don't recognize you yeah but
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   you so you don't tire of having that he said one of the one of the things he
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:32.880]   does is it's uses a timepiece you always use a time it is it's true I like
[00:53:32.880 --> 00:53:36.600]   that really that's a good feature that I like a clock floating in your vision
[00:53:36.600 --> 00:53:41.040]   right and when you're in a meeting you can just casually right but you have to
[00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:47.240]   do this I just yeah I just do this yeah you just kind of scratch yourself
[00:53:47.240 --> 00:53:51.840]   yeah in the screen like I do this I brush my hair I got from my hair you said it
[00:53:51.840 --> 00:53:57.320]   so that it goes on tilt or do you have it to a temple tap both temple tap or
[00:53:57.320 --> 00:54:02.560]   tilt would work yeah I think this looks kind of dumb the tap the peacock thing
[00:54:02.560 --> 00:54:07.760]   you don't look dumb at all like totally great I actually gave him to my uncle
[00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:11.640]   and my uncle has a hard time doing this who went like this
[00:54:11.640 --> 00:54:18.400]   he'll love that I mean I know it doesn't work for you getting nauseous
[00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:23.200]   John John has escaped he's taking a picture of the guy who wears glass all
[00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:26.880]   the time hey while John has wandered off let's take a look at what you might
[00:54:26.880 --> 00:54:30.640]   have missed if you didn't watch Twitter every single moment this week
[00:54:30.640 --> 00:54:37.520]   previously on Twitter iPad today the root beer float edition of iPad today
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:41.000]   when you mentioned last week that you would you desire to root beer float I
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:45.240]   took you with your word oh are you gonna act like you made these for us no I did
[00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:50.680]   not make these I made them happen oh frame rate gave a thrones the red wedding
[00:54:50.680 --> 00:54:55.960]   my experience personally was sitting there with my nephew and my wife who have
[00:54:55.960 --> 00:55:03.400]   not read the book I just trying to keep a blank face it was suffocatingly
[00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:09.560]   terrifying for me knowing what was going to happen omg craft now it works just
[00:55:09.560 --> 00:55:13.080]   the same as the other carpet when you set it down on the ground it just kind
[00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:17.480]   of hits the ground and you can see that it is enchanted it looks different than
[00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:23.760]   the other carpet and then when we punch it to unroll it whoa look at that it's
[00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:28.440]   magical this week in Google these long curves in the middle are where it
[00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:32.200]   connects one he's to the other he's saying these these are similar enough we
[00:55:32.200 --> 00:55:35.640]   could do the jump and if you hit the top and hit play it'll play around and
[00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:38.760]   sometimes it'll jump across I'll go ahead Chad what the hell I found a little bit
[00:55:38.760 --> 00:55:44.600]   of a glitch and I wanted to point out why okay the final countdown by Europe
[00:55:44.600 --> 00:55:52.600]   it's an infinite loop I can't believe you even tried the final countdown know how
[00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:55.960]   today we're gonna be calibrating our TVs and the thing is if you're wondering
[00:55:55.960 --> 00:55:59.320]   why would you calibrate the TV at all when you first buy your TV or you go into
[00:55:59.320 --> 00:56:03.640]   the showroom everything is on super bright because we are like molds it's
[00:56:03.640 --> 00:56:07.160]   like oh it's bright look at that one that must be the best TV
[00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:10.920]   and these modes are great for attracting people with these big displays and
[00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:13.960]   everything but they're nowhere near accurate
[00:56:13.960 --> 00:56:22.520]   gizwit and then you spin the locks and a black wow and you can and no you know
[00:56:22.520 --> 00:56:25.640]   what the combination is on us I was just gonna say did you write down those
[00:56:25.640 --> 00:56:29.480]   no oh well fortunately just fell right off
[00:56:29.480 --> 00:56:33.960]   now with half the calories
[00:56:34.360 --> 00:56:38.920]   doesn't seem like a house that I do not have a house that was a house that yes
[00:56:38.920 --> 00:56:42.440]   really I just have learned something because everybody of course
[00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:45.960]   being the geeks that this group is brought out their phone so John John
[00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:48.680]   just wandered off what's this oh no everybody brought out their phones and
[00:56:48.680 --> 00:56:54.200]   started doing stuff miss Joanna Stern has four four phones with her a black
[00:56:54.200 --> 00:56:58.680]   berry and iPhone a galaxy is four and an HTC one she's lost two of them do you
[00:56:58.680 --> 00:57:03.080]   carry all of them yes why well these two I've been carrying for a glass
[00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:07.320]   because only one of them pairs with blue and she likes to call herself
[00:57:07.320 --> 00:57:10.440]   every so often leave a message this is just the best yeah
[00:57:10.440 --> 00:57:13.800]   on the market and the iPhone is your real phone yeah
[00:57:13.800 --> 00:57:17.080]   is that enough not enough that's plenty you need more I think I need more
[00:57:17.080 --> 00:57:20.200]   I think I need one more phone you're not messing around you need like a
[00:57:20.200 --> 00:57:24.360]   you gotta get that HTC one that's a gorgeous phone that he's got
[00:57:24.360 --> 00:57:29.080]   I've got one here but this is oh she's got one she doesn't have a lume
[00:57:29.080 --> 00:57:34.040]   you need like a burner so prison can't listen to you
[00:57:34.040 --> 00:57:37.720]   yeah like a little boost mobile I don't say anything that interesting really
[00:57:37.720 --> 00:57:41.000]   it's not a revelation the first thing Jason Bourne does when the girl gets in
[00:57:41.000 --> 00:57:44.520]   the car and she's being chased by the bad guys is take her phone and throw
[00:57:44.520 --> 00:57:47.800]   it out the window right yeah everybody knows this is the perfect
[00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:52.040]   spy device it has a microphone a camera a GPS an accelerometer
[00:57:52.040 --> 00:57:56.840]   even this one knows my armpit humidity it knows everything about you
[00:57:56.840 --> 00:58:01.080]   yeah so this if you're carrying this this is the NSA invented this practically
[00:58:01.080 --> 00:58:04.520]   okay there's a conspiracy I didn't even listen to that
[00:58:04.520 --> 00:58:07.480]   you know what I saw a tweet today that's like I have a feeling HTC would be doing
[00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:13.720]   a lot better if the NSA made that phone yeah they'd be in business yeah
[00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:17.960]   yeah with the NSA be better if they design since five maybe
[00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:21.560]   uh as Don's touch we said I don't know who's from it was just floating by but it
[00:58:21.560 --> 00:58:24.760]   was so the the big revelation here is that we finally
[00:58:24.760 --> 00:58:28.360]   achieved the level of surveillance portrayed in every 80s and 90s really
[00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:31.640]   exactly I mean that's that's where we are and I think that's why the story will
[00:58:31.640 --> 00:58:35.160]   be hard that that's why it will be hard to carry through it will be hard to
[00:58:35.160 --> 00:58:38.280]   maintain interest in people will say because it's part of the it's part of
[00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:41.640]   the culture of course we knew this I mean the first like
[00:58:41.640 --> 00:58:44.760]   the third episode of Homeland is the right trying to get a fives a warrant
[00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:47.560]   under the table right I mean like yeah he goes to the judge and black
[00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:50.840]   bales yeah and then the judge is like cool is that right
[00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:53.400]   just don't say that thing we never did find out what the thing was
[00:58:53.400 --> 00:58:56.600]   that the judge had done doesn't matter all right we're gonna take
[00:58:56.600 --> 00:58:59.640]   news actually yeah we're gonna talk about you know what's tomorrow WWDC the
[00:58:59.640 --> 00:59:02.760]   worldwide developers conference really Apple will have some revelations
[00:59:02.760 --> 00:59:06.600]   all right this panel if anybody would know Joanna and Nielei and I bet you
[00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:10.360]   Mike has some secret maybe even you john hebsen that's always a possibility
[00:59:10.360 --> 00:59:13.400]   something in up his sleeve let's talk real quickly about
[00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:16.920]   square space then we'll get to that square space calm our uh
[00:59:16.920 --> 00:59:21.960]   our web host and content management system combined that is such a great
[00:59:21.960 --> 00:59:24.680]   solution for anybody who wants to create a website whether you're a
[00:59:24.680 --> 00:59:29.160]   photographer uh if you're trying to sell online square space now has e-commerce
[00:59:29.160 --> 00:59:32.120]   that was kind of the last piece of the puzzle
[00:59:32.120 --> 00:59:35.800]   falling in square space with their version six added mobile responsive
[00:59:35.800 --> 00:59:39.880]   design so one template works no matter how big your screen is it could be a
[00:59:39.880 --> 00:59:44.520]   little one a big one a laptop the site automatically resizes the sites are
[00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:47.160]   gorgeous and their engineers are always in designers
[00:59:47.160 --> 00:59:49.960]   always working on new stuff the square spaces came up with a new uh
[00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:55.320]   template called momentum full bleed just gorgeous template so if you're a
[00:59:55.320 --> 00:59:58.920]   photographer you'll especially that's the dog one yeah that's momentum oh is it

[01:00:03.240 --> 01:00:07.240]   um and the nice thing about square space if the servers will never go down they
[01:00:07.240 --> 01:00:11.240]   are the most robust uh partly because of the tight integration
[01:00:11.240 --> 01:00:14.040]   between the software the this content management system and the server
[01:00:14.040 --> 01:00:17.640]   software just really well done i want you to try it
[01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:21.080]   they've got the most liberal uh trial policy i've ever seen
[01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:24.120]   just go to squarespace.com you don't have to give them a credit card or any
[01:00:24.120 --> 01:00:27.560]   information just an email address the name of your site in a password

[01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:38.680]   trial to just do some ad hoc sites you know you've got an event coming up
[01:00:38.680 --> 01:00:41.480]   create a site because they know once you start playing with this you're going
[01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:44.120]   to this is going to set a new standard for what you want
[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:47.320]   in uh your web host in your web content management system
[01:00:47.320 --> 01:00:50.600]   the e-commerce is great too let's talk about the pricing real quickly because
[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:54.040]   it's it's you might think all of this might cost a lot of money
[01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:57.800]   uh you can go in as low as eight dollars a month for an annual plan
[01:00:57.800 --> 01:01:00.760]   i would recommend the unlimited plan that's 16 dollars a month when build
[01:01:00.760 --> 01:01:04.360]   annually unlimited pages unlimited galleries unlimited blogs unlimited
[01:01:04.360 --> 01:01:06.920]   bandwidth you'll never get a bandwidth bill even if

[01:01:09.560 --> 01:01:13.160]   and then mike algan piles on no bandwidth bill
[01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:17.400]   unlimited storage which i love unlimited contributors you could do the
[01:01:17.400 --> 01:01:20.760]   verge for 16 bucks a month i bet you guys pay a little bit more than that for
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:24.600]   your servers and then if you want to add e-commerce
[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:28.760]   for 24 dollars a month when build annually fully integrated e-commerce with
[01:01:28.760 --> 01:01:31.720]   unlimited physical or digital products or both

[01:02:17.480 --> 01:02:20.200]   michael you're gonna go to the let me in they don't know yeah no
[01:02:20.200 --> 01:02:22.440]   they haven't they say no and it was talking to any anaco they seem to have a new
[01:02:22.440 --> 01:02:25.400]   policy where they don't send out invitations you actually have to say
[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:27.720]   hey i'd like to go or maybe if you have a history of going
[01:02:27.720 --> 01:02:31.000]   they probably invite you guys but the apple seems to have changed that a
[01:02:31.000 --> 01:02:33.240]   little bit that you say i'd like to go and they say okay
[01:02:33.240 --> 01:02:37.080]   i think with wwc there was never really like an official press there was never
[01:02:37.080 --> 01:02:39.960]   well the team there was and then they would throw you out
[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:43.080]   immediately after the keynote say it's developers only from here on out
[01:02:43.080 --> 01:02:46.440]   yeah and then the developers are all nd a they can't talk about anything yeah
[01:02:46.440 --> 01:02:49.160]   so that's the same yeah yeah it's the same i mean
[01:02:49.160 --> 01:02:53.320]   so uh tim cook will take the stage tomorrow morning 10 a.m pacific one p.m

[01:03:23.560 --> 01:03:27.320]   for a while too yeah um yeah and you know what we do we just sit
[01:03:27.320 --> 01:03:30.920]   here in the studio and read your guys vlog posts and then we read them out
[01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:33.320]   lab we do an acumen like you know dutch rake and raul rake and you
[01:03:33.320 --> 01:03:36.360]   do it and here comes tim cook yeah she's gonna
[01:03:36.360 --> 01:03:40.520]   put him down to use some audio no we did puppets last year yeah you guys used to
[01:03:40.520 --> 01:03:42.920]   have some really wiggle back channel audios
[01:03:42.920 --> 01:03:46.600]   calling in uh i wouldn't know about that okay
[01:03:46.600 --> 01:03:50.280]   although if the nsa wants to give us a feed we'd be glad to take i think i
[01:03:50.280 --> 01:03:55.000]   think i used to listen to the audio some someplace we get more uh we
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:58.280]   we get more views from this stuff than anything else we did with the google
[01:03:58.280 --> 01:04:03.240]   io 200 000 uh peak viewers yeah um it's it's people want to know this
[01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:05.800]   stuff right and of course there's a microsoft press conference
[01:04:05.800 --> 01:04:09.080]   simultaneously uh yep yeah what we're gonna talk about
[01:04:09.080 --> 01:04:11.720]   by half an hour yeah microsoft's gonna have a little bit of
[01:04:11.720 --> 01:04:14.760]   explaining to do at this press conference we'll talk about that a little bit later
[01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:19.080]   on but let's stick with the apple topic what do we think
[01:04:19.080 --> 01:04:22.600]   lots of rumors we're certainly gonna see ios 7
[01:04:22.600 --> 01:04:26.600]   and mac os 10 point not 10.9 yeah kitty cat
[01:04:26.600 --> 01:04:30.440]   we're gonna bring out a new mac i think tomorrow tomorrow for sure
[01:04:30.440 --> 01:04:35.080]   a new mac not a mac book pro i would pro i think i might i think there's a good
[01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:38.200]   shot we'll see not the pro but a pro replacement tomorrow
[01:04:38.200 --> 01:04:41.320]   that's what i'm that's the that's the outside money that i'm looking for
[01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:44.200]   because we all know there'll be a new mac book 13 inch retina display i'm sure
[01:04:44.200 --> 01:04:46.600]   that will happen with sad as well although i'll be no i have a
[01:04:46.600 --> 01:04:49.720]   headswell chipset there is a haswell zion
[01:04:49.720 --> 01:04:53.640]   you know a server grade haswell a chip that until announced at
[01:04:53.640 --> 01:04:57.000]   Computex on the last week so i i think you're gonna see
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:01.400]   them but here's my prediction it's not gonna be a tower anymore it'll be a
[01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:05.400]   modular device so you'll have a cpu you can add
[01:05:05.400 --> 01:05:08.760]   via uh thunderbolt you could add another thing
[01:05:08.760 --> 01:05:11.400]   and another thing you have drives or whatever it'll be modular you could
[01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:14.760]   build your own stack that's my prediction that'd be cool i don't know
[01:05:14.760 --> 01:05:18.760]   that's their thing i don't either i think they're gonna write out that case
[01:05:18.760 --> 01:05:21.800]   they have forever and ever and ever the cheese grater never dies
[01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:25.480]   yeah i i don't think they have any it's been two and a half bigger problems i
[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:28.040]   think john yive has an entire operating system right
[01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:31.000]   the last thing he wants to do is is crank out 3d models for
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:36.280]   Tim right yeah team what about this we'll make it look like a race car
[01:05:36.280 --> 01:05:40.200]   yeah now all right i mean i just i think tomorrow is
[01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:43.800]   actually much more make a break for apple than what's
[01:05:43.800 --> 01:05:47.880]   talking about and probably break they i think it's gonna be boring as hell
[01:05:47.880 --> 01:05:50.360]   i think it's just really that i do think they're gonna put us all to sleep
[01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:52.680]   tuned into the microsoft now wait a minute joey that doesn't think so
[01:05:52.680 --> 01:05:55.080]   what do you know i don't think so i mean i think this is
[01:05:55.080 --> 01:05:58.600]   gonna be the biggest change we've ever seen to ios and i think there's
[01:05:58.600 --> 01:06:01.960]   that no matter what that's not gonna be boring besides even if it is boring
[01:06:01.960 --> 01:06:05.960]   that's not boring besides flat design you know i mean i think it'd be a
[01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:09.000]   different design and i think it's really interesting there's gonna be cleanup
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:12.200]   to some of the major apps and i think they might have to change the way some
[01:06:12.200 --> 01:06:17.080]   of it works yeah i mean they you can't as much as we like to think that apple
[01:06:17.080 --> 01:06:19.720]   exists in this hermetically sealed environment they don't care about the
[01:06:19.720 --> 01:06:22.680]   competitors they now yeah they have a lot of competitors
[01:06:22.680 --> 01:06:26.200]   and they know how the notifications work on android they know how the
[01:06:26.200 --> 01:06:29.320]   how it's tied to their cloud services because they stole it yeah they're
[01:06:29.320 --> 01:06:32.440]   they're aware they didn't do a good enough job i mean like
[01:06:32.440 --> 01:06:35.000]   if anything they're just going to do a better job of stealing what android
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:38.520]   has right i think they have to they have to start competing in some of these
[01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:41.960]   i would agree i think there's a great divide right here the question we don't
[01:06:41.960 --> 01:06:44.760]   know the answer and i see the apple
[01:06:44.760 --> 01:06:49.400]   believers who say no there's still magic in this company and they're gonna
[01:06:49.400 --> 01:06:53.000]   surprise us maybe joanna you're one of them they're gonna go away
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:57.000]   and then there those of us who look at apple and say there's no evidence
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:00.840]   of that there's no evidence you know uh minus steve jobs
[01:07:00.840 --> 01:07:04.040]   i don't see anybody saying i have a great vision here
[01:07:04.040 --> 01:07:08.520]   it ain't tim cook he's a supply guy i mean yep they have a lot of talent
[01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:12.200]   there i mean can jonnie it's gonna be i if if anybody
[01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:15.160]   maybe it's definitely gonna be him at least for this staff who think he's
[01:07:15.160 --> 01:07:17.400]   coming out right yeah he's got a lot of people yeah
[01:07:17.400 --> 01:07:19.320]   just not he's talking never does talk does he
[01:07:19.320 --> 01:07:22.840]   and that is the big question in a white road who does the presentation
[01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:27.160]   shiller for the shiller shiller is so bad yeah
[01:07:27.160 --> 01:07:30.440]   if it's shiller then you know what the early money is shiller
[01:07:30.440 --> 01:07:34.680]   cook obviously starts we've had a great year the stores are doing fabulous yeah
[01:07:34.680 --> 01:07:39.000]   we represent now 90 million i-phones so we represent 48 of the market and
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:43.240]   smartphones we're profitable we're doing great we've got 100 billion
[01:07:43.240 --> 01:07:46.600]   we just had all these billion apps we know match was a problem but we feel like
[01:07:46.600 --> 01:07:50.680]   we've really licked it yeah and uh here's they like to laugh at these
[01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:53.800]   gentlemen let's write here's Phil shiller to bring us down
[01:07:53.800 --> 01:07:56.920]   yeah well it's not like tim cook rises you
[01:07:56.920 --> 01:07:59.320]   wow he's not i mean but that's gonna be the high
[01:07:59.320 --> 01:08:03.960]   he's a very shilling man does mac usually yeah he'll do all of it he'll do all
[01:08:03.960 --> 01:08:08.200]   obviously he's done the ios but now we jonnie on if jonnie i've come to
[01:08:08.200 --> 01:08:11.080]   the head of ios and i would definitely stop typing and just like
[01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:14.600]   saw of the rich and elegant yeah he's not it's not gonna be i
[01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:18.120]   it's not gonna be i know he's shy he's very shiller he's a sir
[01:08:18.120 --> 01:08:22.120]   who is the uh he's a sir and he's shy that's weird there's a new head of ios
[01:08:22.120 --> 01:08:24.120]   development it's all it's all under one guy in
[01:08:24.120 --> 01:08:27.480]   yeah oh it's an ios it's a guy's name i don't remember who it is
[01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:29.880]   chadram will tell us and chadram will tell us in chadram will tell us in ten
[01:08:29.880 --> 01:08:33.080]   they're nine eight that's the problem is about thirty second legs that's not
[01:08:33.080 --> 01:08:35.720]   good it isn't any good i think the dark horse for
[01:08:35.720 --> 01:08:39.320]   excitement and i i fed reegee yeah they told us yep i
[01:08:39.320 --> 01:08:42.680]   i think i agree with you the trick is not to point at the chat room go
[01:08:42.680 --> 01:08:46.840]   i think they they know what they did as well as they just pretend you know
[01:08:46.840 --> 01:08:49.400]   oh it's game two is old trick yes my
[01:08:49.400 --> 01:08:54.200]   friday reegee my prison implant so i i think you're right i think that
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:57.080]   anything that is exciting is going to be in the air of software and services is
[01:08:57.080 --> 01:08:59.480]   not going to be hard where they're not going to launch anything in the terms of
[01:08:59.480 --> 01:09:02.600]   hardware that's going to make a difference these are so bad well but that's the
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:06.120]   thing what if i think that the dark horse for an exciting announcement will be
[01:09:06.120 --> 01:09:09.800]   something around syri because syri has been sort of like in cruise control for
[01:09:09.800 --> 01:09:11.960]   two years or something like that and is being
[01:09:11.960 --> 01:09:16.280]   frankly lapped yes yes so i would love to see syri
[01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:18.920]   get some really awesome new capabilities what happened
[01:09:18.920 --> 01:09:21.880]   uh well i mean i think there's a lot they can do with agency they actually
[01:09:21.880 --> 01:09:24.760]   took away some of the things that syri could do when they launched it
[01:09:24.760 --> 01:09:28.200]   used to be able to buy all kinds of stuff and reserve tape with dinners and
[01:09:28.200 --> 01:09:30.920]   they were on the brink of lots of stuff and they used to use
[01:09:30.920 --> 01:09:33.080]   going to be this thing you go out and buy things for you
[01:09:33.080 --> 01:09:35.240]   so now i'd like to see some of that come back that would be
[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:38.280]   pretty awesome and that they may also bring it to the desktop
[01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:42.200]   so and i think that we will see there will be new hardware i think that i'm
[01:09:42.200 --> 01:09:44.360]   gonna have certain to see there'll be new hardware but i'm not
[01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:48.120]   not a big thing i'm predicting that apple tv will be rolled out as a major
[01:09:48.120 --> 01:09:51.960]   surprise that would be a huge surprise that's not gonna happen
[01:09:51.960 --> 01:09:56.520]   it's not gonna happen it happens i'm going that's what i'm saying john knows
[01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:59.240]   that if you predict the most outrageous thing and he's right
[01:09:59.240 --> 01:10:02.840]   you can code you can code that for years definitely get a piece of that
[01:10:02.840 --> 01:10:06.840]   you said that be a tv i mean the number one thing i want in ios is to be able to
[01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:10.520]   hide some icon so i'm pretty sure maybe i'm going to be pretty happy but i don't
[01:10:10.520 --> 01:10:13.160]   know okay you're using a blackberry to android
[01:10:13.160 --> 01:10:16.280]   from i mean my main phone right now is an is an iphone you don't when you
[01:10:16.280 --> 01:10:20.200]   leave your htc one in your galaxy s4 and go back to the iphone you don't feel
[01:10:20.200 --> 01:10:23.480]   gosh there's something missing this i actually switched from android to
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:27.080]   the iphone a couple months ago it feels a little old fashioned yeah
[01:10:27.080 --> 01:10:30.120]   very everyone is i like went the other way what everyone was going to say
[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:34.280]   you like just a plain old grid of icons and why don't you know i don't love that i
[01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:37.240]   miss a lot of things about android daily number one is
[01:10:37.240 --> 01:10:41.240]   definitely the customization options google services the integration there i
[01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:45.480]   mean every time i try and use google now or gmail on my iphone i want to cry
[01:10:45.480 --> 01:10:48.920]   but like a lot of other things what the hell are you using the iphone
[01:10:48.920 --> 01:10:52.920]   my android phone is constantly really it doesn't make me cry i mean i there's a
[01:10:52.920 --> 01:10:56.360]   lot of correct first of all i one of the main reasons i went to iphone was i
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:59.800]   wanted to test most of the apps that were coming there i mean the app that's
[01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:02.440]   the vibrant that's where it is yeah the app lead is
[01:11:02.440 --> 01:11:06.840]   huge especially if in what we do all fine is out now it's
[01:11:06.840 --> 01:11:09.240]   yeah but there's going to be something else and then is that kind of first
[01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:12.440]   come to the iphone and i think also that's a big thing to happen tomorrow right
[01:11:12.440 --> 01:11:16.200]   is that continuing to exclusives right and to focus on the developers
[01:11:16.200 --> 01:11:19.880]   and the fact that and they did say the they asked him cook we allow people to
[01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:23.240]   customize the app and he's like yep we're gonna start opening it up
[01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:27.320]   it's tricky because that's a challenge that's how i can do it how about
[01:11:27.320 --> 01:11:31.800]   also my android phones android phones get very slow
[01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:36.600]   i've owned three android phones and after about a year in they always slow
[01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:40.520]   down no matter what i do and everyone and like people will now be tweeting to
[01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:43.800]   me right now they'll all be saying oh yeah why don't you put on this custom
[01:11:43.800 --> 01:11:47.880]   rom why didn't you go to saijana mod whatever that thing is called i say
[01:11:47.880 --> 01:11:49.880]   that right say that right say that right say that right say that one
[01:11:49.880 --> 01:11:53.560]   saijana mod saijana we are in mafran you're sorry
[01:11:53.560 --> 01:11:56.760]   that's a separate one that you guys don't know about and you know i don't want to
[01:11:56.760 --> 01:11:59.800]   do that roms um you know i never have a phone that
[01:11:59.800 --> 01:12:03.480]   one so i don't know so i'm actually at a cross-ridge i'm hoping ios 7 is really
[01:12:03.480 --> 01:12:06.920]   awesome and i'm going to keep my iphone but if not i'm going to get the
[01:12:06.920 --> 01:12:10.840]   hcc one with the uh stock android yeah yeah i mean that's i'm probably
[01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:14.920]   going to get that anyway yeah i'll tell you what apple should do
[01:12:14.920 --> 01:12:18.360]   is if apple's going to release and i watch this year and they're planning to do
[01:12:18.360 --> 01:12:21.640]   it in the fall which i think you know just before the holidays
[01:12:21.640 --> 01:12:26.040]   they should announce it now get developers working on apps so that when
[01:12:26.040 --> 01:12:29.080]   they release it on fall there's a ton of cool apps everybody knows they're
[01:12:29.080 --> 01:12:32.280]   working on one i mean i i think that's the consensus yeah
[01:12:32.280 --> 01:12:35.160]   and so just like it's not a surprise everybody kind of knows what it's going
[01:12:35.160 --> 01:12:38.840]   to be so ship you know announce it let people develop for it and when it comes
[01:12:38.840 --> 01:12:41.560]   out we have really cool Mickey Mouse watch this
[01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:46.680]   i mean that's not apple's way that's terrible i know i was in a mistake
[01:12:46.680 --> 01:12:50.520]   on their last on their last i think financial call
[01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:53.000]   cook was like we have great products coming out in the fall
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:12:57.480]   yeah and that's right it means it's clear of an indication is anything that
[01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:00.520]   that's going to be we'll see some new laptops tomorrow consumer products are
[01:13:00.520 --> 01:13:03.160]   full yeah maybe they'll maybe we'll tweak the air because they put new
[01:13:03.160 --> 01:13:05.320]   processor in it right i'd love to see an actor with a red
[01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:08.360]   display you won't i don't think you'll see that i think you will see has well i
[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:12.280]   don't know why but i just feel like yeah and the air is not it's going to be a
[01:13:12.280 --> 01:13:15.960]   third but you know the 13 inch if it's thin enough will be air enough
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:19.000]   yeah i think those things come together at some point yeah they're merging um
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:22.600]   the current 13 inch right now i think is slow yeah it is it has well it might
[01:13:22.600 --> 01:13:27.000]   make a difference yeah the other uh of course
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:31.480]   probable releases i radio or whatever they're gonna call their radio service
[01:13:31.480 --> 01:13:35.480]   what could i mean this is a crowded market you've got Spotify Pandora
[01:13:35.480 --> 01:13:39.640]   you've got google in it now with all access what could they do
[01:13:39.640 --> 01:13:42.600]   that would make them stand out they could be apple i don't know what they could
[01:13:42.600 --> 01:13:45.800]   do to make them stand out from the competition but what's really
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:49.160]   interesting about it to me is that they're the rumors are that it's going to be
[01:13:49.160 --> 01:13:51.880]   advertising supported which is a really unapplet free
[01:13:51.880 --> 01:13:56.520]   free and appetizer supported so that's a really that's a google
[01:13:56.520 --> 01:14:01.160]   strategy really i mean it's like apples google's charging google's charging
[01:14:01.160 --> 01:14:06.040]   what's charged well so the the difference is and i think that
[01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:09.240]   google doesn't have what apple has Spotify doesn't have what apple has right
[01:14:09.240 --> 01:14:12.360]   apple has this like vibrant purchase music
[01:14:12.360 --> 01:14:15.960]   retails to it's got iTunes just utterly dominant
[01:14:15.960 --> 01:14:19.720]   and i don't think you're apple you don't want to and google and Spotify and
[01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:24.120]   aria and all those companies they have to prove right that their access model
[01:14:24.120 --> 01:14:27.720]   works right that you can take all the revenue that's you've lost from piracy
[01:14:27.720 --> 01:14:31.480]   you charge people eight dollars figure out some percent stream and everybody
[01:14:31.480 --> 01:14:35.320]   gets paid and where gets rich yeah that is not proven but but it's great as a
[01:14:35.320 --> 01:14:37.800]   consumer it's proven that this is awesome
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:40.920]   as a business model it's definitely not but that's the key to understanding
[01:14:40.920 --> 01:14:43.320]   to answer your question what they're going to do to set themselves apart i
[01:14:43.320 --> 01:14:47.720]   think that their i radio thing will be based on your existing
[01:14:47.720 --> 01:14:51.560]   music that's sitting in iTunes and they're the probably do something where you
[01:14:51.560 --> 01:14:54.760]   you have you have radio stations around the things you own
[01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:57.560]   that's what google is so you're other stuff than the obsession google all
[01:14:57.560 --> 01:15:01.000]   access is doing exactly they don't have it but they don't have
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:04.600]   like i hadn't bought a lot of stuff on google itons might be a curse and a
[01:15:04.600 --> 01:15:09.000]   blessing well i see i seems as do you want to live in itunes the next
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:13.320]   chapter of the innovators dilemma is about hi-tunes right i mean
[01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:16.920]   how do you kill the most successful retail music product it has existed
[01:15:16.920 --> 01:15:21.320]   online and it desperately needs to be updated but it's also
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:24.360]   still massively successful right you and i need to update it because we've
[01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:28.040]   moved on but there's a huge audience i reviewed the ipod nano when it came
[01:15:28.040 --> 01:15:30.600]   out the new one i was listening to piece of junk i don't ever want to
[01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:33.560]   manage files again right and the amount of hate mail that i received
[01:15:33.560 --> 01:15:37.320]   but i love itunes i'm still completely into it this is the right product for
[01:15:37.320 --> 01:15:40.760]   so many people i think it's so funny because we will say as you did
[01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:44.040]   and i did and near-lided it's junk we don't like itunes
[01:15:44.040 --> 01:15:47.880]   and people will go what are you talking about yeah right
[01:15:47.880 --> 01:15:51.480]   there are some people i don't want to know are people out there that can't
[01:15:51.480 --> 01:15:54.920]   use it at all they can't figure it out it's crazy i don't hear them doing web
[01:15:54.920 --> 01:15:57.720]   forget it yeah i don't think they they will say we don't have to do web for
[01:15:57.720 --> 01:15:59.800]   this they were gonna have the apps for the i mean
[01:15:59.800 --> 01:16:02.040]   they're probably will not have an android app but they'll have
[01:16:02.040 --> 01:16:05.560]   an iphone app when your itunes store they'll have so they won't put it in the
[01:16:05.560 --> 01:16:09.720]   itunes in the existing app they'll put a separate i radio app i think
[01:16:09.720 --> 01:16:12.280]   either they'll update that or they'll have a separate app that's not
[01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:15.400]   i mean like if you look at the way apple's going they'll bundle it into desktop
[01:16:15.400 --> 01:16:18.440]   itunes right word to make that more of a mess right
[01:16:18.440 --> 01:16:21.400]   and they'll they'll build a separate radio because they already have podcasts
[01:16:21.400 --> 01:16:25.080]   separate books are separate right yeah how the podcast and the radio thing
[01:16:25.080 --> 01:16:26.840]   are going to work together they're going to start
[01:16:26.840 --> 01:16:30.440]   like you're mostly streaming all the time yeah there's other podcasts that do
[01:16:30.440 --> 01:16:33.800]   well we are you know right now our itunes does have a nobody knows it but
[01:16:33.800 --> 01:16:36.040]   there's a radio section in itunes and you can
[01:16:36.040 --> 01:16:39.800]   listen to us in the radio section i had long with oh a handful i had no idea
[01:16:39.800 --> 01:16:42.840]   right people don't generally know that yeah
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:45.320]   um all right well we'll look forward to it tomorrow
[01:16:45.320 --> 01:16:47.800]   microsoft is going to have some things to say tomorrow
[01:16:47.800 --> 01:16:51.720]   sony two e3 begins as far as a ridiculous day it's crazy
[01:16:51.720 --> 01:16:55.000]   uh and uh we'll talk about that in just a second
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:17:00.360]   uh the sad story of omg pop just up the street from you guys
[01:17:00.360 --> 01:17:03.000]   i'm just making that up it's all of new york's pretty close yeah it's really
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:06.200]   it's a small little island it's just one train really yeah
[01:17:06.200 --> 01:17:11.720]   uh and uh and more coming up vine is on
[01:17:11.720 --> 01:17:15.960]   oh i forgot ways a big story we used ways to use ways here
[01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:19.880]   it's ways the best is i love the one halfway through i decided i don't like it
[01:17:19.880 --> 01:17:21.720]   i don't like it i don't like it i'll let my android phone use google
[01:17:21.720 --> 01:17:24.680]   so i was actually tweeting during the show about ways and somebody said oh
[01:17:24.680 --> 01:17:27.960]   you're tweeting during the show about this but i'm i'm
[01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:31.640]   i'm sorry i did i did because there's these rumors about google
[01:17:31.640 --> 01:17:35.560]   right it was it was during commercial and i'm scared i'm really scared i have
[01:17:35.560 --> 01:17:38.440]   well i've had i wrote a couple columns about this because i think something
[01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:41.000]   happened to google because they're very secretive you don't know what's in the
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:44.120]   back end of any of these things i think they're their whole
[01:17:44.120 --> 01:17:49.000]   uh navigation system was leased from somebody and they took it back
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:53.480]   because i am in the navigation of late they're telling me to make you turns they
[01:17:53.480 --> 01:17:56.360]   never used to do that they won't rot me around traffic anymore
[01:17:56.360 --> 01:18:00.040]   maybe it's you driving it's not at all and i asked the press
[01:18:00.040 --> 01:18:03.000]   at google and they would refuse to discuss this oh wow
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:06.360]   and now that they're talking about maybe buying ways that's interesting i'm
[01:18:06.360 --> 01:18:09.480]   thinking why would obviously they're buying ways because whatever they had
[01:18:09.480 --> 01:18:13.080]   is gone and i the my original column was the time i was
[01:18:13.080 --> 01:18:17.880]   one-on-one with some guy with them with the old with the new the new apple
[01:18:17.880 --> 01:18:23.960]   navigation and my google and he beat me the routing was much superior right
[01:18:23.960 --> 01:18:27.160]   there's something up with this with the google that was in silicon valley though
[01:18:27.160 --> 01:18:29.480]   where you would expect apple to do well
[01:18:29.480 --> 01:18:33.560]   google's there yeah well let's take a break let's talk about that uh

[01:21:55.800 --> 01:21:58.200]   the new netflix uh arrested development so they
[01:21:58.200 --> 01:22:01.320]   it's true weird but i'm about halfway through it's weird it's weird it's
[01:22:01.320 --> 01:22:03.560]   weird why is it weird but you gotta like this strategy
[01:22:03.560 --> 01:22:06.680]   house of cards amazing well house of cards made sense right because it made
[01:22:06.680 --> 01:22:09.160]   all that it wants. they're asked development they only focus on one
[01:22:09.160 --> 01:22:11.560]   character per episode so the the thing that makes
[01:22:11.560 --> 01:22:15.240]   arrested development cool is the ensemble yeah it's it's not all
[01:22:15.240 --> 01:22:18.840]   there all the so like there's a Tobias funky episode yeah oh wow
[01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:22.040]   two of them actually um there's some there's some like real
[01:22:22.040 --> 01:22:24.200]   great moments they probably couldn't get the actors all together at the same
[01:22:24.200 --> 01:22:27.240]   time and they did some weird green screening and did they look old
[01:22:27.240 --> 01:22:30.840]   they look old because it's like six years later yeah different makeup
[01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:34.120]   yeah the makeup is changed uh the kid who plays on obviously he's like really
[01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:39.080]   hung on grew up well bloody still there uh hung on it's it's it's weird
[01:22:39.080 --> 01:22:42.440]   it's cool you should watch it if you have netflix it's free yeah no it's free
[01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:47.000]   bit it's uh it's not has a card game of thrones last episode tonight
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:49.960]   everybody's dead it's gonna be good it's gonna be very quiet i hope they
[01:22:49.960 --> 01:22:56.280]   kill the show weather at it's for an alert somebody somebody tweeted uh you
[01:22:56.280 --> 01:23:01.400]   know why george rr martin's not on twitter he killed 140 characters
[01:23:02.200 --> 01:23:09.560]   whoa the two glass guys they laughed out you can hear readings
[01:23:09.560 --> 01:23:13.720]   they're watching they got other jokes they don't care about the show they've
[01:23:13.720 --> 01:23:18.200]   been giving up on the show like i already so ways 1.3 billion dollars that's the
[01:23:18.200 --> 01:23:22.840]   room we're coming from a reliable source of globes which i checked with my
[01:23:22.840 --> 01:23:26.200]   summer's rally viewers i said is that you know is that trustworthy oh no no
[01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:30.040]   that's very trustworthy and all things he is cooperating yeah yeah they just
[01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:34.200]   say we read in globes but uh they're actually have some
[01:23:34.200 --> 01:23:37.560]   sources say that yeah and they're reporting also says that um google's
[01:23:37.560 --> 01:23:40.200]   gonna keep it independent which i'm very happy to hear well
[01:23:40.200 --> 01:23:44.600]   he's always saying the only story was that apple only offered them half a
[01:23:44.600 --> 01:23:48.680]   billion and so they that was in january so they said we're worth more than half
[01:23:48.680 --> 01:23:53.240]   a billion then facebook comes in offers them a billion but wants to move them
[01:23:53.240 --> 01:23:57.080]   to silicon valley right right and these are Israeli developers and they said no
[01:23:57.080 --> 01:24:00.600]   we're not gonna move so google gives them everything they want 1.3 billion
[01:24:00.600 --> 01:24:03.560]   dollars you're gonna have complete autonomy google's demonstrated they
[01:24:03.560 --> 01:24:06.520]   facebook's never done that yeah google's demonstrated they could do that with
[01:24:06.520 --> 01:24:10.120]   youtube i mean they've they've killed some other things why
[01:24:10.120 --> 01:24:13.400]   youtube is like a different class of acquisition right
[01:24:13.400 --> 01:24:15.960]   google had google video and they bought youtube and everyone's like well you
[01:24:15.960 --> 01:24:19.000]   should definitely get rid of google video nobody's saying you should get rid of
[01:24:19.000 --> 01:24:22.360]   google maps no i think there's presumably going to be
[01:24:22.360 --> 01:24:26.520]   not a replacement for google maps yeah this won't be a replacement but
[01:24:26.520 --> 01:24:30.280]   by the way it agrees with me what makes ways great it's the uh
[01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:33.400]   i don't know community yes you do know we used it on the way here yeah i got
[01:24:33.400 --> 01:24:37.800]   a whole spotting cops we used it here we had a we had two phones going side by
[01:24:37.800 --> 01:24:40.680]   side and ways was telling us more about traffic
[01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:43.960]   it was telling more about the people people ahead of us were telling us
[01:24:43.960 --> 01:24:47.240]   about what was coming up yeah there's stuff in the road i always hit it
[01:24:47.240 --> 01:24:52.120]   and now with ways i never hit it what what
[01:24:52.120 --> 01:24:57.240]   my homicide rate has completely fallen oh since i started using it used to hit
[01:24:57.240 --> 01:25:03.080]   stuff on it area where gardeners load up their truck with ladders and lawn
[01:25:03.080 --> 01:25:06.200]   mowers and rakes and invariably it blows off the truck
[01:25:06.200 --> 01:25:10.120]   and i swear to god if i have i hit him every time they're in the middle of the
[01:25:10.120 --> 01:25:13.640]   road i don't want to swerve so i rob them if you don't want to
[01:25:13.640 --> 01:25:17.480]   swerve i don't know what's behind me i'm not paying attention i go what
[01:25:17.480 --> 01:25:20.520]   oh crap by the time i notice that i've hit it but with
[01:25:20.520 --> 01:25:25.160]   ways right i have you don't want to advance i'm looking at my smartphone while i
[01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:27.640]   drive to bed too bad they're not a sponsor that way
[01:25:27.640 --> 01:25:31.560]   is that i don't like using ways i know where he's going because unless you
[01:25:31.560 --> 01:25:35.240]   have a navigator i mean i've done this i've done this when
[01:25:35.240 --> 01:25:37.800]   why i was telling him on that like a lot of people will say you know there's a
[01:25:37.800 --> 01:25:42.280]   car pulled over yeah 10 feet ahead or whatever it is and and it's usually
[01:25:42.280 --> 01:25:44.600]   accurate you know it gives you all this information about
[01:25:44.600 --> 01:25:48.280]   there's a cop up ahead slowed down and then it says was it there or was it not
[01:25:48.280 --> 01:25:51.640]   right and you tell it no you're supposed to be driving no no you do it all by
[01:25:51.640 --> 01:25:55.160]   voice okay sure you can actually wave your hand over the phone yeah there's
[01:25:55.160 --> 01:25:58.840]   still distracting report traffic incident i think you've got two people in the car
[01:25:58.840 --> 01:26:02.280]   in one person on the way's machine and i think that's my head she's my way
[01:26:02.280 --> 01:26:06.440]   she's a navigator yeah yeah i asked the ceo a couple months
[01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:09.960]   gone there apparently working with with car manufacturers and other things i
[01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:12.440]   mean who knows now with what will happen with google but
[01:26:12.440 --> 01:26:15.560]   i think what google's after is that social stuff right is
[01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:18.600]   obviously figuring out the algorithms that they have
[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:22.600]   putting that into to their back end i mean my what i love about ways though is
[01:26:22.600 --> 01:26:26.600]   that i'm completely anonymous that i don't have my facebook account hooked up i
[01:26:26.600 --> 01:26:30.760]   have i do you don't want that i don't want that because i don't want
[01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:34.520]   people on the road to know like oh there she is let's get her right
[01:26:34.520 --> 01:26:38.600]   my car people would hate head aluma right now cari says twitter i mean it's
[01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:42.840]   not like i'm you know yeah but what do you think people think when they see
[01:26:42.840 --> 01:26:46.680]   that a lot of times they go up yours twit no
[01:26:46.680 --> 01:26:51.160]   very frequently because you keep hitting gardeners
[01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:55.240]   the rigs people uh will will will parallel me
[01:26:55.240 --> 01:26:59.480]   and they'll go high thumbs up all the time all the time
[01:26:59.480 --> 01:27:03.160]   here in petaluma you drive that much not that much a lot of churches here in
[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:06.840]   petaluma we noticed this but we're very very devout
[01:27:06.840 --> 01:27:10.120]   uh area it's a town in 1850 so you have a lot yeah
[01:27:10.120 --> 01:27:13.400]   no there's this is called you see you guys and there's the open door church
[01:27:13.400 --> 01:27:17.800]   church has an open door the door's opened yeah it's amazing walk right in
[01:27:17.800 --> 01:27:20.840]   yep well the gosh churches they got a look at us
[01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:23.480]   thanks to prism
[01:27:23.480 --> 01:27:29.400]   here we go again so i think they said 47 million people
[01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:33.640]   use ways 47 million is not a huge community compared to say instagramer
[01:27:33.640 --> 01:27:36.440]   uh face pretty good dumber in a hundred and this is what i thought
[01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:40.200]   interesting hundred ninety three countries yep uh so the but there's a lot
[01:27:40.200 --> 01:27:43.000]   of room for growth as well i mean i think this is a great acquisition for
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:46.760]   google to make yeah i was just happy somebody's having to do it
[01:27:46.760 --> 01:27:48.760]   but somebody finally about ways because i'm
[01:27:48.760 --> 01:27:51.400]   we're just extremely tired of hitting rumors
[01:27:51.400 --> 01:27:55.480]   gardeners yeah well that never gets old clearly
[01:27:55.480 --> 01:27:58.280]   now the ways i'm and somebody in the chat and said well how do they make
[01:27:58.280 --> 01:28:02.200]   money and that's the only thing i don't like about ways because
[01:28:02.200 --> 01:28:05.720]   you'll stop at a stoplight and then ads will start to you get
[01:28:05.720 --> 01:28:09.480]   alerts and the ads like you want to go eat here i would say that was
[01:28:09.480 --> 01:28:11.640]   and he was saying no we have to get to twit
[01:28:11.640 --> 01:28:14.760]   it's a little annoying i wanted to be a half an hour late
[01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:19.320]   even over the hour where you wanted to stop at i hop yeah i think it told us
[01:28:19.320 --> 01:28:23.000]   taco bell was near no really yeah t-vow they make crap out of
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:27.560]   Doritos yeah yeah there's good Mexican food here
[01:28:27.560 --> 01:28:30.760]   yeah i'll take you guys out after the show well i'll show you where the good
[01:28:30.760 --> 01:28:34.200]   stuff is uh all right so we're agreed this is going to happen and it's a
[01:28:34.200 --> 01:28:38.840]   good thing yes yes okay and worth the money i think worth the money yeah
[01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:43.080]   you know it's funny at i.o google made i think this story of i.o is
[01:28:43.080 --> 01:28:48.840]   google made really strong showing of power right about their services right
[01:28:48.840 --> 01:28:52.760]   and they especially with maps they showed a unification
[01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:56.840]   that they had showed before i think they also were like check out our cool
[01:28:56.840 --> 01:29:00.280]   android education project and then another eight come on he's like check
[01:29:00.280 --> 01:29:03.240]   out our cool crumbles education all right yeah you're right i mean there was
[01:29:03.240 --> 01:29:07.880]   they were better than usual but right it wasn't complete but with maps especially
[01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:11.400]   yeah they really i mean they know that apple's building maps they know they
[01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:14.520]   need the credibility in i.o.s they know that they lost that platform
[01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:19.480]   such a f*ckster you're such a bad bad man what nothing
[01:29:19.480 --> 01:29:28.920]   trust are you thoroughly refreshed yes good uh thanks for asking no but i
[01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:31.800]   just think that this is a very i mean in the past google's looked like a
[01:29:31.800 --> 01:29:35.000]   hundred different companies they really started to look like but particularly
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:38.120]   in the maps presentation very they were like we have the best maps
[01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:40.840]   and i think the message was you can't catch up with us
[01:29:40.840 --> 01:29:42.840]   not really that you can't compete now and we're
[01:29:42.840 --> 01:29:46.280]   and we're moving forward and that's where i wonder why apple didn't buy them
[01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:49.320]   but apparently they said they didn't want to maybe have enough money yeah
[01:29:49.320 --> 01:29:53.320]   oh apples yeah right that's a good one yeah well they got so much money hold
[01:29:53.320 --> 01:29:56.440]   on to that money you know do it this yeah they're building a beautiful
[01:29:56.440 --> 01:30:00.120]   beautiful uh facility it looks like a spaceship
[01:30:00.120 --> 01:30:03.960]   perspective of google maps which is the the street view of everything yeah
[01:30:03.960 --> 01:30:07.000]   and now they apparently sent some guys down the matter horn
[01:30:07.000 --> 01:30:10.920]   yeah two pictures of everything but see that's the cool thing ways does not
[01:30:10.920 --> 01:30:15.080]   have that great graphical display so i think you merge yeah the google
[01:30:15.080 --> 01:30:19.160]   uh street view the satellite view the street the map view
[01:30:19.160 --> 01:30:23.320]   and then ways back end you got some right i think there'll be a lot of people
[01:30:23.320 --> 01:30:25.960]   out crying on privacy and stuff like that but we'll
[01:30:25.960 --> 01:30:29.800]   go goodbye what's fascinating about maps and and how it relates to where google
[01:30:29.800 --> 01:30:32.600]   is at is they've been laying a lot of groundwork
[01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:35.800]   for things that almost happen by themselves in the future so maps that's
[01:30:35.800 --> 01:30:37.800]   what i feel so what they're doing with maps is they're
[01:30:37.800 --> 01:30:41.400]   creating a virtual version of the entire earth that just keeps getting more
[01:30:41.400 --> 01:30:44.760]   detailed and more accurate and more out of the north korea
[01:30:44.760 --> 01:30:49.960]   yeah yep and so and so if you look at the future of maps five years ten years
[01:30:49.960 --> 01:30:53.000]   from now it's going to be like the matrix you're going to be able to go into
[01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:55.080]   this thing is going to be the real world there
[01:30:55.080 --> 01:30:58.360]   if there's studio i think aren't they still yeah well we did it yeah we
[01:30:58.360 --> 01:31:00.520]   think these guys the glasses are going to walk through
[01:31:00.520 --> 01:31:03.880]   well that's going to be interesting and that is maybe the secret agenda of
[01:31:03.880 --> 01:31:06.120]   glass is to further their their
[01:31:06.120 --> 01:31:10.200]   their politics which is still like a little overlaying mat on top of it
[01:31:10.200 --> 01:31:14.840]   but we're gonna have a lot of pictures from today i think
[01:31:14.840 --> 01:31:17.720]   there it is that's uh that's our for those of you watching a video that's our
[01:31:17.720 --> 01:31:19.960]   3d walk where's the guy that's in behind the desk
[01:31:19.960 --> 01:31:23.400]   all the that's max trollbot sitting behind the desk
[01:31:23.400 --> 01:31:26.040]   there's some uh this has quite a few easter eggs in it
[01:31:26.040 --> 01:31:28.680]   my staff thought it'd be fun to prank them
[01:31:28.680 --> 01:31:31.720]   oh so you want to prank google i think that's a bad idea
[01:31:31.720 --> 01:31:35.480]   is you know this is in google it's a third party that you pay to do this
[01:31:35.480 --> 01:31:39.080]   and then he's a registered developer with google and he has he hits it on
[01:31:39.080 --> 01:31:42.920]   that yeah he drops it in um so there yeah some there's some double
[01:31:42.920 --> 01:31:46.520]   people in here so well you could tell the camera hounds they show up three or
[01:31:46.520 --> 01:31:50.600]   four times yeah that's great and then
[01:31:50.600 --> 01:31:55.880]   it's kind of fun uh so microsoft has uh actually had a little bit of trouble
[01:31:55.880 --> 01:32:00.920]   of uh late and i'm very curious if they're going to address tomorrow
[01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:05.160]   uh some of the problems for instance uh it looks like despite their
[01:32:05.160 --> 01:32:09.320]   protestations to the contrary their used games are going to be problematic
[01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:12.680]   on the uh xbox you know so i think microsoft and so they're going to switch
[01:32:12.680 --> 01:32:16.120]   places tomorrow so you know so i launched the ps4 and it was like
[01:32:16.120 --> 01:32:20.200]   two hours of game demos right and they didn't even show the console right
[01:32:20.200 --> 01:32:23.560]   microsoft launched the xbox one it was all about the console and like living
[01:32:23.560 --> 01:32:27.640]   room and connect and like no games i think tomorrow you'll see microsoft do
[01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:30.920]   games games games right you see stony talk about the console in the living room
[01:32:30.920 --> 01:32:34.680]   um but this use game stuff for i think both platforms
[01:32:34.680 --> 01:32:39.560]   it will be a story but they're saying they're going to allow some use game
[01:32:39.560 --> 01:32:42.920]   sales of the publishers agree they're saying that it only has to connect once
[01:32:42.920 --> 01:32:46.600]   every 24 hours there's a lot of detail to fill in there
[01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:49.480]   and i just i don't know if any of that detail is going to be filled out
[01:32:49.480 --> 01:32:52.280]   until they start shipping the thing you don't think they'll respond to
[01:32:52.280 --> 01:32:55.720]   criticism i think tomorrow they're going to show it's e3 they're going to show
[01:32:55.720 --> 01:32:57.640]   a bunch of those people get them killed in the future
[01:32:57.640 --> 01:33:00.680]   call it e call it e yeah and that's what they do and it
[01:33:00.680 --> 01:33:03.480]   they have a lot to prove there i think that i think they left a lot of questions
[01:33:03.480 --> 01:33:05.480]   and answer about what the games are going to look like
[01:33:05.480 --> 01:33:09.160]   and tony i mean has to show us what well if you're going to show games you show
[01:33:09.160 --> 01:33:12.760]   them at e3 you don't need to show them at an event at another time
[01:33:12.760 --> 01:33:15.960]   all right well we'll watch with interest it's too bad it overlaps with apple
[01:33:15.960 --> 01:33:17.880]   what we're going to do we're going to have one search before
[01:33:17.880 --> 01:33:21.000]   yeah only half an hour before though yeah but they won't be done
[01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.720]   yeah oh they will you know what they might be done before Tim Cook has done
[01:33:23.720 --> 01:33:26.200]   with his like look all the money we made this year yeah
[01:33:26.200 --> 01:33:30.440]   we'll see it's me rough it's gonna be well we we've got a team we're going to
[01:33:30.440 --> 01:33:33.080]   have lenn Rubenstein covering the xbox stuff
[01:33:33.080 --> 01:33:36.120]   and then we'll be doing another team over here and we'll interrupt each other
[01:33:36.120 --> 01:33:39.560]   i was thinking doing left ear and right ear like stereo like Microsoft in one
[01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:42.760]   ear but i think we'll probably you know a split screen but i think you
[01:33:42.760 --> 01:33:45.000]   should do the video for one in the audio for the other
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.640]   that's perfect
[01:33:47.640 --> 01:33:49.880]   and i bet you most people wouldn't even know your reference
[01:33:49.880 --> 01:33:53.560]   the hell out of people no well the Microsoft audio will be full of
[01:33:53.560 --> 01:33:56.600]   explicit that makes sense so you definitely use the
[01:33:56.600 --> 01:33:59.240]   Microsoft yeah you should definitely use them it'll be very exciting
[01:33:59.240 --> 01:34:01.640]   and apple before active all-purs come on stage
[01:34:01.640 --> 01:34:05.800]   let's try that's great let's do it we'll do a mix a mashup
[01:34:05.800 --> 01:34:10.040]   all right that's a good idea so talk about bad acquisitions
[01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:15.320]   omg pop zinga bottom 180 million dollars a year ago at the peak
[01:34:15.320 --> 01:34:17.880]   at the peak of the success of the way to do it
[01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:23.000]   and now a year later they they shuttered the New York office and laid off
[01:34:23.000 --> 01:34:27.640]   everybody who worked at omg pop and who were apparently very happy
[01:34:27.640 --> 01:34:31.000]   to be laid off they were they were just be they're rich and they were being
[01:34:31.000 --> 01:34:34.040]   ignored yeah that's the way it works i mean zinga's
[01:34:34.040 --> 01:34:37.080]   they got to figure out what their business looks like but this is stupid
[01:34:37.080 --> 01:34:40.120]   because zinga's problem was that they were facebook gaming
[01:34:40.120 --> 01:34:43.080]   and they wanted to get into mobile they bought omg pop because this is their
[01:34:43.080 --> 01:34:46.040]   new strategy so meanwhile they kill all the mobile developers
[01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:49.880]   yeah and say farmville too it's going to be good
[01:34:49.880 --> 01:34:53.640]   it is good i think that this is i would not invest in this company right
[01:34:53.640 --> 01:34:57.640]   yeah yeah yeah stock is a good thing yeah well it already has
[01:34:57.640 --> 01:35:02.040]   right well facebook is going to webcast its first ever stockholder meeting
[01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:05.720]   june 11th so there's another thing it's going to be exciting it's going to be
[01:35:05.720 --> 01:35:08.280]   exciting you know stockholder meetings aren't that
[01:35:08.280 --> 01:35:11.960]   exciting i think no no well this one in particular has got to be a
[01:35:11.960 --> 01:35:14.920]   just snoozer yeah do you don't think they'll be uh
[01:35:14.920 --> 01:35:20.360]   irate people saying where's our money no that's all over now
[01:35:20.360 --> 01:35:24.440]   yeah mark so uh they're going to elect board members
[01:35:24.440 --> 01:35:29.560]   uh the members seeking election are mark zuckerberg

[01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:43.960]   so the good news uh... in the patent role world is that eff has raised a
[01:41:43.960 --> 01:41:48.680]   ton of money to go after uh... that bad podcast pet patent
[01:41:48.680 --> 01:41:51.320]   which we're all worried a little bit about
[01:41:51.320 --> 01:41:55.560]   president obama has said uh... we're gonna do an executive order to fight
[01:41:55.560 --> 01:41:57.240]   patent roles
[01:41:57.240 --> 01:42:00.120]   he's asked congress to do the same
[01:42:00.120 --> 01:42:02.920]   uh... is this real
[01:42:02.920 --> 01:42:04.760]   this is um...
[01:42:04.760 --> 01:42:06.120]   it's really
[01:42:06.120 --> 01:42:08.280]   i mean how much for nerdy you want me to be cuz i'm nerdy
[01:42:08.280 --> 01:42:12.440]   be nerdy uh... it's really wild that this all happening the eff stuff is
[01:42:12.440 --> 01:42:13.040]   great
[01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:18.440]   but that's like that's very normal mark you get stupid patents and uh...
[01:42:18.440 --> 01:42:20.600]   julie samuels she's great yet
[01:42:20.600 --> 01:42:23.720]   but this but for the gump for the president
[01:42:23.720 --> 01:42:28.120]   right so what's what's wild about this is that we just passed the a_i_a_ the
[01:42:28.120 --> 01:42:30.840]   american men's act and everybody who talked about it
[01:42:30.840 --> 01:42:33.000]   afterwards so there's no more
[01:42:33.000 --> 01:42:37.080]   political capital to do this again we've done enough it took a decade
[01:42:37.080 --> 01:42:39.720]   the guy who's in charge david capo's who's
[01:42:39.720 --> 01:42:41.800]   head of patent office was like i'm done
[01:42:41.800 --> 01:42:45.320]   past it i'm out of here you know glaze out of town early
[01:42:45.320 --> 01:42:49.560]   uh... and our back and the thing about is that the solutions proposed
[01:42:49.560 --> 01:42:52.280]   are the solutions like everybody has known that there really
[01:42:52.280 --> 01:42:55.320]   since ronald's cuz you have talked a lot about this what needs to be done you
[01:42:55.320 --> 01:42:56.920]   feel like this is these are good
[01:42:56.920 --> 01:43:00.000]   good proposals if they're passed well
[01:43:00.000 --> 01:43:01.640]   if they're passing if they
[01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:04.200]   they're very vague right now i mean that the
[01:43:04.200 --> 01:43:06.840]   the two are one if you're patent role
[01:43:06.840 --> 01:43:09.640]   you have to disclose he's really make money off your lawsuit
[01:43:09.640 --> 01:43:12.600]   which is kind of a good name and shame right everybody's one that for a lot
[01:43:12.600 --> 01:43:16.200]   of time in the second one is functional claiming which is kind of the software
[01:43:16.200 --> 01:43:19.960]   patent solution right which is you can't just patent like button plus
[01:43:19.960 --> 01:43:22.680]   internet is a new device right you have to
[01:43:22.680 --> 01:43:25.480]   think you have to make something to make something new
[01:43:25.480 --> 01:43:27.880]   uh... and that's great and
[01:43:27.880 --> 01:43:30.840]   that's like you know that solves all the problems everybody's discussed the
[01:43:30.840 --> 01:43:32.520]   solutions that way
[01:43:32.520 --> 01:43:35.720]   but the reality is congress laws to pass a law right the courts have to
[01:43:35.720 --> 01:43:36.800]   interpret it
[01:43:36.800 --> 01:43:39.320]   the executive orders the patent office need to be
[01:43:39.320 --> 01:43:42.320]   flushed out into what they mean so there's a long way to go
[01:43:42.320 --> 01:43:45.640]   this is craziest that it's even happening in this moment
[01:43:45.640 --> 01:43:49.320]   and nobody expected to happen this does nothing for the apple versus samsung
[01:43:49.320 --> 01:43:52.120]   kinds of legitimate patent battles those are legitimate
[01:43:52.120 --> 01:43:53.920]   what's there's actual products
[01:43:53.920 --> 01:43:55.880]   this is very good non-practicing
[01:43:55.880 --> 01:44:00.080]   is people who are not actually so the new acronym the new acronym
[01:44:00.080 --> 01:44:02.840]   uh... it's apparently we've gone i don't know when this happened
[01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:04.440]   everybody had a meeting and tell me
[01:44:04.440 --> 01:44:07.280]   uh... we've gone from n_p_e_ non-practicing any
[01:44:07.280 --> 01:44:09.760]   to patent assertion entity p_a_e_
[01:44:09.760 --> 01:44:11.480]   and don't know why
[01:44:11.480 --> 01:44:13.760]   just what we're going to do any other thing that's interesting is that i
[01:44:13.760 --> 01:44:17.200]   want to be sure that the phrase patent role now yeah
[01:44:17.200 --> 01:44:19.320]   that's you know that's you know that i credit
[01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:22.920]   uh... lee more free lady eight of cuz it was a hangout
[01:44:22.920 --> 01:44:26.040]   and i don't know if this really is what precipitated but it sure feels like it
[01:44:26.040 --> 01:44:28.600]   with president obama some months ago where she said we're going to about
[01:44:28.600 --> 01:44:31.920]   paten trolls she runs a defraut which is a wonderful
[01:44:31.920 --> 01:44:35.840]   site everybody should visit if they're interested in making and and projects
[01:44:35.840 --> 01:44:36.600]   and so forth
[01:44:36.600 --> 01:44:39.000]   what do you do about paten trolls and he said well
[01:44:39.000 --> 01:44:40.600]   it's not right we're to do something about it
[01:44:40.600 --> 01:44:43.520]   yeah and now a few months and i think the government has heard
[01:44:43.520 --> 01:44:47.320]   silicon value complained out of the uh... and i think that's what the
[01:44:47.320 --> 01:44:49.280]   political capital is coming from
[01:44:49.280 --> 01:44:51.680]   nobody expected it's happening to him
[01:44:51.680 --> 01:44:52.760]   but they've got a
[01:44:52.760 --> 01:44:54.640]   this is another five years of arguing
[01:44:54.640 --> 01:44:58.480]   and and uh... and uh... and ours technica calls us the good news for tech
[01:44:58.480 --> 01:45:01.040]   law reporters section so you should be jumping up and that
[01:45:01.040 --> 01:45:05.120]   the white house wants patent demand letters to be made public yep incentivizing
[01:45:05.120 --> 01:45:08.160]   public filing of demand letters in a way that makes him accessible and searchable
[01:45:08.160 --> 01:45:09.680]   to the public so you'll know
[01:45:09.680 --> 01:45:12.520]   who's asking what of whom
[01:45:12.520 --> 01:45:15.760]   i mean that you've built an instrument in the in the a_a_ backfired in a really
[01:45:15.760 --> 01:45:17.880]   significant way right which is
[01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:18.840]   uh...
[01:45:18.840 --> 01:45:21.560]   and i don't know why they thought this would work
[01:45:21.560 --> 01:45:25.160]   they said it in the american man's act they prohibited
[01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:28.160]   me having a patent filing all of you at once
[01:45:28.160 --> 01:45:30.880]   so i think that's a little bit of class actions it was just multiple
[01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:32.600]   defendants right so i was
[01:45:32.600 --> 01:45:36.760]   i would sue you and join a mic for violating a panel on lawsuit
[01:45:36.760 --> 01:45:40.480]   uh... in companies would sue adobe in apple Microsoft and they said you have to
[01:45:40.480 --> 01:45:42.120]   file it was a lot of times
[01:45:42.120 --> 01:45:46.000]   one of the courts clogging the courts but you know the idea was you'll pay
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:47.960]   filing fees for that add up
[01:45:47.960 --> 01:45:51.160]   which is like not now there are a couple hundred bucks yet so but
[01:45:51.160 --> 01:45:53.720]   but so what they ended up with they ended up with this huge spike in the
[01:45:53.720 --> 01:45:57.200]   graph of patent lawsuits huge forty five percent increase
[01:45:57.200 --> 01:46:00.200]   and it's like well not really and it's just they literally just filed the same
[01:46:00.200 --> 01:46:03.520]   lawsuits but you have to do individual plan i think that's actually really
[01:46:03.520 --> 01:46:05.440]   helped to make the argument for further form
[01:46:05.440 --> 01:46:06.960]   yeah good
[01:46:06.960 --> 01:46:09.240]   good news fine for android
[01:46:09.240 --> 01:46:11.640]   thirteen million users of mine i noticed my kid
[01:46:11.640 --> 01:46:13.320]   went from face book doesn't use it
[01:46:13.320 --> 01:46:16.320]   to instagram uses it less vine loves it
[01:46:16.320 --> 01:46:19.480]   so if you were you know if you thought all face books got it
[01:46:19.480 --> 01:46:21.360]   the monopoly it's over nobody's never moved
[01:46:21.360 --> 01:46:25.120]   now it's just like face book my space i was always the next new thing for kids
[01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:28.840]   right and by i i was really excited about buying used it heavily for two weeks
[01:46:28.840 --> 01:46:31.640]   and i'd sort of wanted away and i think it's really slow
[01:46:31.640 --> 01:46:34.840]   you know yeah it's it's a it's frustrating because when you want to
[01:46:34.840 --> 01:46:38.840]   when you hear about a vine you want to go find it's very difficult hard
[01:46:38.840 --> 01:46:42.520]   yeah and i think i just have the feeling that is this is going to come and go
[01:46:42.520 --> 01:46:45.640]   and it's going to be popular and then people get sick of it move on
[01:46:45.640 --> 01:46:47.080]   um...
[01:46:47.080 --> 01:46:48.440]   by by one
