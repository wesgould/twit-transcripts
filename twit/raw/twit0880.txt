[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:05.560]   Hannah and just normal photo shooting camera. I've realized you can just put it above your computer and it looks great
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:12.560]   And you've got sunlight coming in. This is a total vermeer. It's beautiful. Well done. Thank you. Thank you
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:14.560]   Better lit than I am unfortunately

[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:31.760]   Protocol good to see you again. Hey Leo good to see you welcome. Welcome. You're in the office. I think I am
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:36.720]   I'm kind of having camera envy though. I know what kind of Canon is it Paris?
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:46.080]   It's actually kind of an old candidates in EOS rebel. Yeah the rebels. Yeah. Yeah, did your parents give that to you when you
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.080]   graduated from high school
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:51.880]   Yeah, I got it went before I went abroad in college
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:57.880]   Yeah, and it has been sitting me in my closet for quite a few years now and I had it looks the other day
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:04:01.280]   It was I was looking up webcams and I was like man I could just bring this out
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:06.240]   Yeah, and it's right and it's retro just like the turntable behind you. So it's perfect exactly a
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:09.840]   Trip back in time with Barry's Mart now
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:16.040]   Paris is that one of the one of those old Apple speakers? It looks like it doesn't it?
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:21.240]   It's a it's a what's it called? I'm gonna it is those are the Apple those a Harman Carden
[00:04:21.240 --> 00:04:27.440]   Gardens those tubes yeah, they like for the 20th anniversary Mac sort of yeah
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:33.120]   It was for they're technically computer speakers, but I think they look really close there's a way to get it to focus on this
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:35.200]   Yeah, they're clear isn't that wild here?
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:40.640]   It looks like one of those things that you would put your hand on and all the sparks come out
[00:04:40.640 --> 00:04:43.120]   You know kind of one of those mad scientists
[00:04:43.120 --> 00:04:49.960]   Tesla coil it's a Tesla coil of speakers. Hey, we got Sam a bull salmon now
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:55.440]   So his Comcast is back Sam is also here principal researcher at a guy in house insights
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.940]   He's the wheel bearings podcast all about cars. He's my car guy on the tech guy show. Hi Sam
[00:05:00.940 --> 00:05:04.220]   Hi Leo good to be back with you drop off
[00:05:04.220 --> 00:05:10.280]   yeah, we're doing the pre show there all of a sudden everything all you guys froze and I
[00:05:10.280 --> 00:05:13.200]   went to check check my
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:15.200]   network on my phone and
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:22.880]   Nothing and I ran upstairs and the cable modem lights were not showing the way they should be so I had to restart everything
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:30.560]   Well, oh good restart worked. That's good. Yeah restart the cable modem restart the network good now
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:34.080]   It's all good. How many show of hands. How many of you have Bitcoin here? I?
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:39.960]   Don't but I know someone close to me who did and
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:43.240]   Lost an unfortunate amount of yeah
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:44.440]   I
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:50.080]   Do you like it's a little shot in Freud and I shouldn't feel good about anybody losing money especially nowadays
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:57.400]   But Bitcoin went below 20,000. It's actually gone back up a little bit. It actually got down to about 18,000
[00:05:57.400 --> 00:06:00.440]   Over the weekend. Holy cow. Wow
[00:06:00.440 --> 00:06:07.120]   Holy cow and you know the scary thing about this is that people who really should have known better
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:15.400]   Got into this thing in a big way and you know a lot of them got burned. That's why I shouldn't say oh isn't
[00:06:15.880 --> 00:06:20.280]   To me, it's like oh, yeah Bitcoin went down. What a surprise, you know
[00:06:20.280 --> 00:06:26.720]   You should have known better, but I feel bad for people who you know saw Matt Damon saying courage favors the brave
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.800]   And they said well, I'm gonna be courageous and buy Bitcoin
[00:06:29.800 --> 00:06:36.920]   Of course if you hold stocks right now your 401k is probably not doing too well either
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:42.640]   We don't look at that. Yeah, we don't look at the numbers when they go down
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:47.560]   That's right. Just keep pumping the money in there, you know every paycheck and then you know
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:53.320]   Hopefully at some point in the future there will be enough in there to at least you know
[00:06:53.320 --> 00:06:58.800]   You know give you a little bit of extra spending you keep working until you drop that right
[00:06:58.800 --> 00:07:00.800]   Well, I think you know
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:06.600]   I think the scary thing about the markets right now are stocks are down bonds are down crypto is down like you know
[00:07:06.600 --> 00:07:09.640]   There's you know everything's down in the past
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:15.800]   When stocks went down people would buy gold and I thought Bitcoin would be like that right like that would be oh
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:21.240]   There's a lot of people thought that it would be like gold, but didn't you know unfortunately, you know at least gold
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:26.720]   You know you have something physical that you know has some well, but let's be fair
[00:07:26.720 --> 00:07:32.520]   The industrial value of gold comes nowhere near the price of gold
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:36.320]   I mean yeah, you could if if you had some gold bricks in your basement
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:41.960]   You could probably find somebody to buy it to make you know expensive stereo dongles
[00:07:41.960 --> 00:07:44.840]   But it's not like it's gonna be what's in price of gold?
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:50.800]   Perhaps it's a lot more than the industrial value of it. So gold is probably similar to Bitcoin in that respect, right?
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:08:00.840]   Well, I mean at least it has some industrial value Bitcoin, you know, it's nothing. Yeah, you know, it's it's a scam
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.080]   Yeah
[00:08:02.080 --> 00:08:05.600]   The current I think there's the future guys. That's what we're all forgetting
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:09.820]   I guess I have to be the the web3 defender and you know, I
[00:08:09.820 --> 00:08:18.160]   Well, I think there is you know, there is some utility value in
[00:08:18.160 --> 00:08:25.560]   In cryptocurrencies broadly, you know in the idea of like greatly improving cross-border payments taking a lot of
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.880]   cost out of the equation
[00:08:27.880 --> 00:08:31.600]   Not necessarily with Bitcoin because Bitcoin is one of the least efficient
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:37.680]   Cryptocrits out there the problem is that the speculation value the you know the quote-unquote investment value
[00:08:37.680 --> 00:08:44.800]   But really it's speculation the speculation value of these cryptocurrencies is at complete tension with any utility the more
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:54.320]   volatile and hence, you know short-term money making these currencies are the less useful they are for payments, right as El Salvador has learned
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:09:01.960]   To their chagrin they made Bitcoin last year their state currency replacing the dollar
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.760]   And now they can't pay their debts
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:10.600]   I shouldn't well, I shouldn't make it go ahead. I think they made it legal tender
[00:09:10.600 --> 00:09:12.880]   But I don't think they completely replaced the dollar
[00:09:12.880 --> 00:09:16.120]   I think they made it parallel as an alternative to the dollar
[00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:21.440]   Oh, that's good. You use the dollar or use use Bitcoin, but it didn't completely replace the dollar
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:27.120]   They bought a significant amount of Bitcoin which was also a little bit of a mistake
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:34.400]   I shouldn't laugh, but there's so many Bitcoin bros, especially those Bitcoin billionaires going around saying you see you see it's the future
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:36.560]   There's so much hype around it. I
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:41.600]   Guess I feel terrible for anybody who's lost money
[00:09:41.600 --> 00:09:48.480]   You know because I don't know I doubt it will come back to its former glory days. Maybe it will
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:53.080]   But I think maybe some of the blooms off the rose so I feel terrible for anybody's lost money
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:10:00.240]   But at the same time I'm glad that it's kind of taken some of the air out of the market ironically Jack Dorsey former
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:04.400]   Twitter CEO founder one of the founders of Twitter announced
[00:10:04.400 --> 00:10:09.280]   Web 5.0, which is web 2.0 plus web 3.0 based on
[00:10:09.280 --> 00:10:16.800]   Bitcoin's blockchain just a couple of weeks ago. That's not looking like a good choice right about now
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:26.960]   Coinbase time for web 6.0. Yeah, maybe if we got to skip ahead what's there? Now. Are you you said you're gonna defend web 3
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.800]   What is good about web 3?
[00:10:30.800 --> 00:10:39.040]   I mean there's a limited set of circumstances where a blockchain which is you know, basically a right-only database that's
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:41.520]   That's distributed on the internet
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:47.720]   Is useful and it's generally where you don't want to have one party
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:53.920]   Maintaining a database and where you know like where you don't want to have to trust someone right? Um
[00:10:53.920 --> 00:10:56.160]   like a bank
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:11:02.560]   Yeah, exactly. I mean the the irony is that we've built up all these systems that do rely on trust and
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:05.360]   people are kind of used to it and
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:08.800]   there's even a kind of a thinking in the
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:16.080]   You know in the crypto world that well like if you get caught by a scam you didn't do your research, right? It's your fault
[00:11:16.080 --> 00:11:22.960]   Because you shouldn't have to try it. And who do you blame right? There's no bank to complain to yeah, exactly
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:32.240]   Um, so I don't know, you know to your point Leo. I am very sympathetic to people who saw a misleading ad and kind of you know
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:37.120]   And kind of went for it based on you know based on this false premises
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:41.680]   I'm you know, I'm also sympathetic to people who say hey the existing system is
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:47.520]   uh, you know, I believe you know people who believe the existing systems rigged against them and
[00:11:47.520 --> 00:11:54.320]   You know don't want to you know don't want to invest in stocks. They're certainly not getting any kind of interest on their bank deposits
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:57.600]   Um and you know and see it as a way to yeah
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:12:01.760]   And that's exactly the situation this person close to me was in it
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:09.520]   Didn't believe you know thought the system was corrupt and broken and and basically rigged against normal people and
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:18.400]   You know was reading reddit forums and even even when I tried to explain, you know the the technical stuff and the limitations
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:26.880]   Uh, you know, I mean there's as you said, I agree that there's some some theoretical, you know, really interesting use cases for blockchain and crypto
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:32.880]   But when you actually start looking at it as you know as a a store of value
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:37.760]   You know, it becomes way more problematic, you know and trying and actually trying to use it
[00:12:37.760 --> 00:12:45.520]   Uh, and certainly no, but I don't think anybody has come up with a really viable way of making it usable as a store of value
[00:12:45.520 --> 00:12:51.920]   Um, and when when you when you look at the world around you today and and see all the corruption
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:56.320]   You know it it is very enticing to jump into something like this
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:13:03.040]   And you know, hope that you know, maybe this is going to be a solution to the problems that we have part of the eye opener though
[00:13:03.040 --> 00:13:04.880]   Is it's not corruption free?
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:10.400]   The world is full of corruption as full of scammers is full of bad guys and nft's it turns out
[00:13:10.400 --> 00:13:14.480]   Uh, not only is it centralized pretty much all on open c
[00:13:14.480 --> 00:13:17.040]   Uh
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:20.960]   But if open c decides as they did with the board ape
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:26.480]   Uh, oh, we're not going to sell anymore. You can't that's it. You're done. So it is centralized
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:30.320]   And there are plenty of scammers out there who found ways to steal nft's
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:33.040]   Uh to fish nft's
[00:13:33.040 --> 00:13:38.320]   I mean, I I feel like it's it's the best it's the worst of all worlds combined
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:43.920]   But it does have this utopia and promise of something better. I just don't I just don't see it happening
[00:13:43.920 --> 00:13:49.520]   There's also the environmental impact which we can't ignore. I know that banking has an environmental impact as well
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:52.480]   But uh, you know these proof of work
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:55.120]   Crypto currencies right now
[00:13:55.120 --> 00:14:00.560]   Are not exactly the thing we should be doing. I think as the as the world gets hotter and hotter
[00:14:00.560 --> 00:14:04.800]   I mean my one issue is that people are describing them as
[00:14:04.800 --> 00:14:08.320]   Currencies, but really what they're being used as right now is just
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:15.120]   For speculation. They're tulip bulbs. Mm-hmm. Yeah, they're tulip bulbs that we're all better except they don't look pretty in the spring
[00:14:15.120 --> 00:14:17.840]   Yeah, yeah
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:20.400]   To your point sam at least you could plan a tulip
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:25.120]   Even if you paid five thousand dollars for it at least you'll get a tulip
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:31.200]   Maybe not if your tulip is held in a vault under the Swiss Alps. Yeah, maybe not
[00:14:31.200 --> 00:14:36.160]   Uh, anyway, I don't I don't want to pile on uh, if you if you're holding bitcoin
[00:14:36.160 --> 00:14:38.160]   I I have almost eight bitcoin
[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:42.240]   But I can't access it because I forgot my password and it's just sitting in my mouth. Oh
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:46.640]   Yeah, it's an old story. Everybody knows this story. That's no actually not all no
[00:14:47.440 --> 00:14:53.200]   Well, maybe oh no if but see this is always a problem with even with stocks if you knew when the peak was
[00:14:53.200 --> 00:14:58.320]   It would be oh no you should have sold leo in a 60,000 because it's never going to be there again, but is it?
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:04.960]   If I sold it today at 20,000 and it goes to 60 in a year. Did I do the right thing?
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:07.440]   So it's better. It's locked away
[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:10.080]   I didn't buy them. There were donations for a while
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:13.280]   You know, we we have a tip jar or something on the website for a while
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:16.080]   I had a QR code for bitcoin wallet
[00:15:16.080 --> 00:15:18.720]   And so yeah, no, I didn't buy them
[00:15:18.720 --> 00:15:21.120]   There they were able to send to you eight bitcoin
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:24.640]   Well, this is in the the last one
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:30.320]   Where was a few dollars back then? This was when they were worth anything and they were even sending whole bitcoins are sending fractionals
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:36.080]   But enough people did it. It was 7.85 bitcoin and I can see it. It's in the why I have the wallet
[00:15:36.080 --> 00:15:39.360]   I just have to remember the past phrase to unlock it
[00:15:39.360 --> 00:15:42.240]   it'll come to me
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:43.920]   I
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:47.440]   Don't feel as bad and I mentioned this before too and I apologize if you're hearing me repeat
[00:15:47.440 --> 00:15:51.440]   I don't feel as bad as Steve Gibson our security guy when bitcoin first started
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:57.200]   He thought I'll be fun to set up a bitcoin miner next morning literally next morning 50 bitcoin came out of it
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:00.400]   Early on it was easy to do that on just a pc
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:05.840]   So he put it on he put the wallet on a hard drive forgot about it later erased the hard drive
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:08.720]   So he had even by today's
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:10.560]   standards
[00:16:10.560 --> 00:16:12.560]   He had a million bucks
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.240]   um, you know
[00:16:14.240 --> 00:16:17.600]   He had three million dollars at the peak that just
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:20.240]   He never he'd be erased
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:25.040]   And that's the other by the way, no central bank nobody to complain to
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:31.440]   You lose you forget your password you forget your you'll erase your hard drive you lose your wallet
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:38.720]   You use a custodial wallet, which a lot of people did at Mount Gox and other places you lose it. They ain't nobody to complain to
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:44.960]   Of course if you set fire to a pile of you know paper bills the bank that's true place. That's a good point
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:52.160]   That's a good point. Yeah, but yeah, I mean the the the non-reversibility of cryptocurrency transactions
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:55.280]   But by and large there are some there are some that are reversible
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:17:02.400]   Uh, but that you know, that's a big problem and people haven't really gotten in their heads around the customer service implications of that
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:05.360]   Just the you know, like if there's transaction fraud
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:08.560]   Um, I haven't even heard people talk about that issue
[00:17:08.560 --> 00:17:12.480]   Right as much which I think is a big issue in terms of making it mainstream, right?
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:17.440]   At least Jake Paul is broke now. That's all i'm just happy about that. That's all
[00:17:17.440 --> 00:17:22.880]   There's no way he's broke. He probably has marginally less money
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:28.000]   Yeah, I mean there's still worth 20,000 unless he bought it at 30
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:34.240]   Or is he is he leveraged if he bought it? Oh, he could be he could be
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:39.840]   Apparently he put all the thing that brings Jake Paul down. I'll be very surprised
[00:17:39.840 --> 00:17:42.560]   What a world
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:48.000]   I you know, but I think that I think that a lot of what we're seeing like why is everything kind of
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:52.400]   collapsing at once it's because you've had a ton of leverage
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:58.560]   Uh into this market. Um and all of this leverage bets are unwinding at once right?
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:04.000]   And it's just enormous selling pressure and by the way this picture is why there are people
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:08.720]   Maybe me who have some shodden Freud about all that. There's Jake Paul
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:11.600]   literally rolling in money
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:16.480]   And uh, you know, that's why people don't like bitcoin bros, right?
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:21.440]   There's a you know, and so I feel bad anybody lost money. I'm sorry. I'm sorry. Jake
[00:18:21.440 --> 00:18:24.080]   Uh, at least you have your boxing career to fall back on
[00:18:24.080 --> 00:18:29.040]   Uh, isn't that his brother? Oh, is it logans that I can't keep track of a hot? I don't know
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:35.040]   There's not a husband my son who is hip and with it tells me there's one good paul in one bad paul
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:39.200]   Inside of you. There are two pauls
[00:18:39.200 --> 00:18:47.920]   Jake paul did blame biden for the fall of bitcoin. So i'm thinking oh, so there's that yeah
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:51.040]   Maybe he's them. Maybe he's the bad paul
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:55.120]   Uh, all right. We we're not going to go on and on bitcoin
[00:18:55.120 --> 00:18:57.120]   Uh, I hope it goes back up
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:18:59.840]   I really do for all of us all of your sake
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:07.360]   Uh, and I hope they go to proof of stake or less energy intensive ways of uh of keeping the ledger because that's not good either
[00:19:07.360 --> 00:19:14.000]   But before before you move on going back to um, oh one's defensive of web three
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:20.800]   Um, you know, I think some of the the principles behind that like more decentralization getting away from
[00:19:20.800 --> 00:19:26.640]   Everything being consolidated with a few major players like facebook or and google and apple and
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:31.280]   And and so on. I think I like that in principle
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:36.240]   But you know the reality is the reason why it got centralized in the first place is
[00:19:36.240 --> 00:19:43.440]   People don't most people don't want to and and don't know how to run their own servers and and do all this stuff on their own
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:49.040]   Right. This is something that you know that the technology is such that invariably you will end up
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:54.560]   Consolidating it, you know with a few players and and open c and you know everything else
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:20:00.720]   There's no reason why you know technically today why it couldn't be um decentralized
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:02.640]   I mean that's what it was to begin with
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:07.040]   But the the reality is most people don't want to manage all of this stuff
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:12.320]   You know, they want to be able to just use use the stuff without thinking about it right
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:17.280]   Yeah, I agree with you 100 and that's that's also part of the problem because
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:21.920]   Uh, you know you're gonna get taken if you aren't vigilant
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:26.240]   Uh with with this with these cryptocurrencies, uh,
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:29.040]   You know what how the winkle vos twins are doing
[00:20:29.040 --> 00:20:34.160]   Aren't they playing a concert recently? Yeah, they're rocker rollers now. They're new
[00:20:34.160 --> 00:20:35.920]   That's a new thing
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:37.920]   Cameron winkle vos says
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:44.240]   I can't believe bitcoin's taken they were they took all the money that they got by suing mark zuckerberg
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:51.040]   Saying he stole facebook from them. They plowed that into crypto. They had a crypto fund. They did all sorts of stuff
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:54.720]   Um, don't gamble with money. You can't afford to lose
[00:20:54.720 --> 00:21:04.240]   But again, they had you know, they they had that uh facebook money. I wonder I wonder if you compared the performance of bitcoin versus
[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:07.840]   Metastock metastock's not done that well either right
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:10.720]   They're probably glad they got out of that. Yeah
[00:21:10.720 --> 00:21:12.880]   For many reasons
[00:21:12.880 --> 00:21:17.040]   Cameron winkle vos tweeted bitcoin under 20k feels like an over rotation
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:22.160]   The underlying fundamentals adoption and infrastructure have never been stronger
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:29.120]   We saw the irrational top this feels irrational the other direction, which is his way of saying keep buying bitcoin
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:37.200]   I think the most impressive thing about that tweet is that he doesn't have an nft profile. Oh, you're right. Well, he's not east. You know, he's
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:39.840]   He's going to see right
[00:21:39.840 --> 00:21:43.360]   Yeah, that makes sense. I wonder if all the people who have dot eth
[00:21:43.920 --> 00:21:50.800]   Twitter handles are quickly redicking those off changing their I want to know how the crypto dot com stadium is doing
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:54.160]   Oh my god. I hope they've got the money up front
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:22:00.640]   Yeah, the renames is staples center crypto dot com remember all the crypto ads on the super bowl
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:06.080]   I fit you know what that's kind of like when pet's got pet's dot com right advertising on the super bowl
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:11.280]   Larry, remember larry david, uh his ad where he's the boomer
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:15.120]   Who is you know thinks everything's dumb the wheel
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:17.680]   toilets
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:19.680]   Bitcoin the wheel is pretty dumb
[00:22:19.680 --> 00:22:25.360]   Yeah, so it was a funny ad and what did the wheel ever do for but all it was was really saying okay boomer
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:28.880]   You don't get it bitcoins all that
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:36.240]   And uh, you know, I hope he got paid in dollars america dollars. That's all I believe he did. I think there was a
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:43.120]   Really outlet but someone had followed up with him and they're his agent after that ad like did you guys get paid in bitcoin?
[00:22:43.120 --> 00:22:49.040]   How do you feel now? They're like we got paid in normal dollars. We don't know anything about it wasn't ad
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:55.440]   Slurry just got up and run a script. That's
[00:22:55.440 --> 00:23:00.320]   Yeah, it was very funny. It was as good as kerb your enthusiasm his tv show
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:05.680]   What about all those mayors who quote unquote got paid in bitcoin? I mean first of all they never got paid in bitcoin
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:09.520]   They they took their mayoral paychecks and converted it to bitcoin, but
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:11.360]   uh
[00:23:11.360 --> 00:23:15.440]   That's uh, you know, that's got to be a hit. I think the I think the mayor of miami
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:19.760]   He has some other job. So he said like he wasn't worried about it
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:25.200]   Which they miami created their own, uh, cryptocurrency
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:32.720]   Uh, I yeah, I guess he ran on the notion that he's really uh, you know hip france frances swan us
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:39.760]   doing I thought it uh crashed it's uh, it's actually it's actually issued by a company called city coins
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:41.360]   Miami's just a
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:47.120]   a beneficiary so well like that's a light label. Uh, city. Let me tell you what happened february second
[00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:50.320]   They cashed out of miami coin
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:55.840]   depositing five and a quarter million american dollars into the city
[00:23:55.840 --> 00:24:01.200]   cities coffers at which point miami coin crashed 95
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:06.720]   Percent is worth 30 point zero zero three two dollars right now
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:12.960]   Uh three one hundredths of a sec like miami in the future miami coin is underwater
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:15.520]   Oh, wow
[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:16.560]   Good one
[00:24:16.560 --> 00:24:17.760]   And I can make that
[00:24:17.760 --> 00:24:23.360]   Burn well and you're also next door to eric adams who was so jealous of swarez that he said
[00:24:23.360 --> 00:24:28.240]   Oh, i'm gonna take my first three paychecks in bitcoin the new mayor of new york city
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:34.400]   Uh, I think he's changed the subject lately. I don't know if new york cities they were gonna also issue a new york coin
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:36.480]   I believe I think that that plan is
[00:24:36.480 --> 00:24:41.680]   That's there was going to be filling coin. I think philadelphia ran them out of town
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:50.640]   As usual, uh, apparently swarez told davos he spoke about this adavos. He says, uh, I still take
[00:24:50.640 --> 00:24:53.520]   uh my salary and bitcoin
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:59.600]   But he said if it I have other as you said, oh and I have other income
[00:24:59.600 --> 00:25:07.440]   If if if a person was deciding to take their whole salary in bitcoin if it was the only source of income for them, I wouldn't recommend it
[00:25:07.440 --> 00:25:10.880]   Oh really
[00:25:10.880 --> 00:25:16.320]   He's a uh, he's come because he have isn't mering a full-time job. Yeah, you would think
[00:25:16.320 --> 00:25:21.600]   But I guess in miami, everybody's got a side game. You can have a side hustle. Yeah
[00:25:23.200 --> 00:25:25.360]   Um, anyway, uh, I don't
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:34.320]   I shouldn't gloat because I am going to have to work for the rest of my life because my 401k is now down 25% as well
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:38.560]   so, uh, you know, uh, we're all suffering
[00:25:38.560 --> 00:25:41.520]   inflation through the we're all suffering
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:47.840]   We're all suffering. Yeah, we're all suffering. It's not nothing to nothing to celebrate anyway. Happy father's day. Happy june teens
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:51.600]   Oh good
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:55.520]   I almost don't want to bring up elan musk. He is of course one of the people who uh
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:26:02.320]   It's been flogging cryptocurrency. He's remember the dogecoin tweet now. He's being sued for billions of dollars
[00:26:02.320 --> 00:26:04.560]   for
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:07.200]   By it's a you know, it's one of those class action suits
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:13.360]   People claiming that dogecoin was a pyramid scheme, which it wasn't it was a mean coin
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:19.360]   Uh, but elan said he was going to buy it. It went up. In fact, he just said it again
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:22.720]   Yeah, he just tweeted this
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:25.120]   It's tell. I mean elan
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:28.800]   He says I will keep supporting dogecoin. He tweeted that yesterday
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:34.720]   Keep buying it then says altcoin gordon to which elan says I am
[00:26:34.720 --> 00:26:39.360]   That man needs to impose screen time limits on his devices
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:44.160]   He just needs to log off. I think no one should be on twitter
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:48.720]   I told you this sim on the radio show today. There's this whole um
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:52.720]   you know this great man hypothesis, right that
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:59.200]   We love to think of uh, you know a tony stark. We love to think of thomas edison
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:02.400]   You know, allexand are the great these great
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:05.840]   Men who changed the world single handedly
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:07.840]   We love this myth
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:13.840]   But I think if any of these great men except for tony stark if any of these other great men tweeted who is a fictional character
[00:27:13.840 --> 00:27:18.960]   Who is completely made up and if he tweeted he probably tweet cool, but anybody
[00:27:19.920 --> 00:27:24.560]   twitter in if thomas edison at twitter we would have known what a dick he was
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:28.000]   If henry ford had twitter we would know he was an anti-semite
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:34.080]   Well, we didn't know that henry was what was was an anti-semite because you know, he published little pamphlets
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:37.520]   Yeah, but i forget that's the difference between tweeting
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:46.560]   And publishing little pamphlets like I bet you most of the people buying ford automobiles didn't really know about henry's, you know hobby
[00:27:46.800 --> 00:27:50.880]   True, uh, but that's the thing it twitter reveals all
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:58.400]   Yeah, it's the classic you know better from tweeting to a pan flit based me
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:01.520]   Let's you know that's the punishment
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:06.960]   If you get back to bamfles twitter you have to punch published pamphlets
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:12.000]   It's the classic is the classic, uh, you know better to
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:15.440]   Remain silent and be thought of fool then speak up and prove it
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:22.560]   Oh, so what's it just retweeting become like hiring people to distribute those pamphlets door-to-door
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:29.200]   Yeah, those i mean it's just like buying it's like buying you know, like retweet it's like buying followers
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:35.920]   You know you pay people just redistribute your pamphlets knock on the door. I'm trying i'm here bringing you the good word for me
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:40.720]   Have you found elon?
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:46.000]   Uh, he is facing a 258 billion dollar lawsuit over dogecoin
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:51.600]   Which makes me think that the only reason he tweeted that he's still all in on dogecoin is to
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.320]   troll the people who are suing him, I guess
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:59.200]   He just doesn't care when is he going to face some?
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:02.960]   Consequences for what he's doing with the twitter murder deal though
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:06.720]   Because I mean clearly there were terms in that that said don't disparage twitter
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:10.640]   You know don't try and shake up the deal and he is doing all of those things
[00:29:10.640 --> 00:29:14.640]   twitter wants him to pay 54 20 for their
[00:29:14.640 --> 00:29:17.200]   chairs so badly
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:22.000]   And he knows this that they are willing to put up with all sorts of bad behavior
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.480]   Now there is a billion dollar breakup fee, but they want all 54 20 a share
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:31.280]   They want the 44 billion dollars and I think that's just what's going on. They're just saying I
[00:29:31.280 --> 00:29:36.160]   I don't just let's get to the end of this elon did address an all hands meeting at twitter
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:39.200]   uh, I imagine terrifying
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:42.240]   the
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:47.920]   In on a port like he face timed in like portrait mode style crap
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:50.400]   Talk about disrespect that's
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:53.040]   Yeah, well for especially given his recent comments
[00:29:53.040 --> 00:29:59.840]   You know his recent memo to tesla employees about working remotely, you know that you know if you want if you want to do
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:02.560]   Fake work go somewhere else, you know
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:06.240]   He dialed in coming in remotely to twitter 10 minutes late
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:10.320]   via his phone he was it was early by elon time
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:16.480]   I mean this this is so disrespectful right if it's an all hands meeting get a desk
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:21.840]   Get get zoom get a get an eos rebel come on get a decent camera
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:27.680]   Treat these people in respect your time talking about aliens. That's what he did
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:30.400]   He did
[00:30:30.400 --> 00:30:32.400]   Yeah, I'm pretty sure he talked about aliens
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:37.680]   Among other topics. Uh, wasn't much talk. Is he is he bullish on aliens?
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:45.280]   Is he he still thinks we're in a simulation. So this is the picture of elana. It looks like he's in a hotel lobby
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:47.520]   It looks like he's doing a cameo
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:54.720]   Happy birthday paris. It's elon bus wishing you best regards
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:57.680]   I think you should do the rest of the show in that
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:01.200]   Not how elon talks
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:07.680]   According to kacie newton's platformer. He says here also at one point musk mentioned that he had seen no evidence of alien night
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:10.960]   Alien life and no one really knew what to make of that
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:16.720]   Also, he's bearish on aliens. I just have seen no evidence. I uh
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:22.400]   He uh, he also says he wants a billion users, which is
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:28.960]   Same. Yeah, it's like five. Yeah, 770 million more than it has right now
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:34.320]   Um, and so he says look a free speech is important
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:37.360]   We should allow people to say what they want, but
[00:31:37.360 --> 00:31:45.360]   Unless you work for space x right? Well, we'll get to that unless you work for space. Yeah, but it's important to make twitter as attractive as possible
[00:31:45.360 --> 00:31:48.080]   And of course free speech
[00:31:48.080 --> 00:31:51.600]   Real free speech which turns you into forchan or worse
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:58.560]   Does not make twitter a billion user platform by any means right? So he's got a little bit of a problem there
[00:31:59.440 --> 00:32:03.120]   Uh, and by the way spam is a protected form of protected speech
[00:32:03.120 --> 00:32:05.760]   So I don't know what he's gonna do there
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:11.920]   Uh, he says really that means showing not showing people content. They would find offensive
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:16.160]   Well
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:22.800]   Even frankly boring is not good tiktok the old tiktok. There you go. Does a great job of making sure you're not bored
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:29.200]   I mean, it's it's freedom of speech versus freedom of reach. He's kind of backing away from the
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:31.440]   You know free speech
[00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:33.840]   You know the free speech wing of the free speech party
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:40.800]   Position and saying well, maybe let people tweet that stuff, but don't show it to anyone else
[00:32:40.800 --> 00:32:42.960]   which is a lot of what you know the
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:48.400]   Republican critics of twitter are worked up about you know the so-called shadow banning
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:55.200]   Um, so is he do you think he's advocating shadow banning because that's not going over now. He seems to be pro shadow banning
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:59.520]   Even though i've seen i've seen him reply to people saying oh, we're going to fix that shadow
[00:32:59.520 --> 00:33:04.560]   Yeah, he's you know what this is the problem. He's he's very much a shoot from the hip kind of guy
[00:33:04.560 --> 00:33:09.200]   And so he's just pro talking. Yeah, he's pro elon
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:11.280]   um
[00:33:11.280 --> 00:33:17.120]   Casey said I I talked to half a dozen or so employees after the meaning reactions were mixed but mostly negative
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:22.560]   Musk won some points were sounding genuinely enthusiastic about the prospect of owning and running twitter
[00:33:23.040 --> 00:33:29.040]   I think that's a good thing there these poor twitter employees are shell shocked because everybody's been going on
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:31.280]   You know jack torsy good see ya
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:35.600]   I mean it's been it's been a rocky 10 years
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:41.200]   Uh, and it looks like he does in fact want it. He's going to go through or at least
[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:48.240]   I maybe if twitter can resolve the spam bot thing you can go through with his $44 billion acquisition
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:53.040]   Um the the spam bot thing was never going to stop the deal like that's yeah
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:56.640]   Well, he wanted a better price. Do you think olin is that what it was about like negotiation?
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:34:01.360]   I think so but there's there's no way the twitter board was going to give it to yeah
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:07.360]   He already signed on the dotted line. You can't he signed he signed a clause called specific performance and specific performance means
[00:34:07.360 --> 00:34:11.840]   You can actually go to a judge and force the other party to consummate the deal
[00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:17.440]   You agreed and and furthermore you agreed as is you didn't say well
[00:34:17.440 --> 00:34:20.320]   Let me do due diligence you specifically waived it right
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:22.960]   musk said
[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:28.320]   He wanted to buy twitter to fix the spam bot problem and then he says oh, I didn't know the respond
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:31.600]   There's so many no sense
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:32.960]   Uh
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:39.600]   Casey newton's on platformer if I were to make a word cloud of employee responses the biggest ones would be incoherent
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:41.920]   rambling
[00:34:41.920 --> 00:34:43.680]   uninspiring
[00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:47.760]   So it's a typical elon speech then yeah, uh, rambling and incoherent
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:53.600]   Is there any takeaway from this? I guess the takeaway is he's he's
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:56.720]   wants to buy it um
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:35:02.640]   He I don't know if that's the takeaway. I think the takeaway is that at that one during that 10 minute
[00:35:02.640 --> 00:35:03.840]   conversation
[00:35:03.840 --> 00:35:08.480]   He wanted to buy it. It's gonna probably change through different times over the next month
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:11.200]   Yeah
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:13.200]   analysts believe he will
[00:35:13.680 --> 00:35:17.360]   Cut 20 percent of the workforce in other words of the 8 000
[00:35:17.360 --> 00:35:21.680]   Uh people listening, you know a couple of thousand gonna lose their job
[00:35:21.680 --> 00:35:30.400]   Uh, he when asked about layoffs he dodged the question, but he did say twitter is losing money and that's not a great situation
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:34.800]   If elon thinks he's gonna make 44 billion dollars back
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:37.840]   in his lifetime on twitter
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:41.360]   He's just wrong, but obviously he got a lot of people to invest right
[00:35:42.080 --> 00:35:46.240]   Where's why are people giving him money to buy twitter? That's crazy
[00:35:46.240 --> 00:35:49.680]   Larry else and gave him a billion dollars
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:53.600]   You're not gonna get that money back larry guess he can afford it
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:59.280]   Uh, I want true here's what must said. I want uh twitter to contribute to a better
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:02.000]   long lasting civilization
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:05.200]   Where we better understand the nature of reality
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:09.520]   It's kind of a heavy burden for a social network
[00:36:11.520 --> 00:36:15.200]   Also probably impossible if it's essentially unmoderated
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:23.520]   Okay, now meanwhile, uh, mr. Free speech fired a number of employees apparently who
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:30.720]   Instigated a letter at spacex the letter saying that elon was embarrassed and embarrassment
[00:36:30.720 --> 00:36:35.360]   And a distraction and a distraction how many people signed that letter
[00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:39.680]   Apparently it was several hundred signed it
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:42.000]   uh, but uh
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:48.640]   Sounds like about five were fired. Um, but apparently they they may think that they were the the instigators of this thing
[00:36:48.640 --> 00:36:50.960]   So you like and say see I didn't fire them all
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:56.080]   Uh, but yeah, I mean, you know, I don't know is it?
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:37:01.920]   If uh, jon if you circulated a petition saying leo's a jerky jerk
[00:37:01.920 --> 00:37:08.400]   And we uh, we don't like him and he's a distraction and embarrassment actually I think that letter was did circulate, but
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:13.360]   Am I allowed to fire you for doing that actually in california? Yes, it's an at will
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:20.000]   You're you're allowed to fire anyone for anything. Yeah, it's in the us. Yeah. Well, I I think well
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   I don't know in some places it may not
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:28.400]   I don't know. I think even in like a you know, even in a stricter state. Uh, yeah, you could still fire people for that
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:34.000]   Yeah, okay for actively disparaging. Yeah, uh, the company, but let's let's talk about the substance. I mean
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:41.040]   You know, like what does any of elan's activity around twitter around dogecoin?
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:48.320]   Have to do with you know with space x which he has always said it like, you know getting to mars making you know
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:56.080]   Making human civilization multi planetary multi planetary is his most important thing. He's not acting like it
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:38:02.480]   He's not signaling that it's the most important thing and I think that is a legitimate gripe by space x employees. Yeah
[00:38:03.760 --> 00:38:07.920]   Although and you know people always say oh you bash elan. You don't ever give him credit
[00:38:07.920 --> 00:38:13.040]   space x launched three rockets in the last 48 hours
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:15.760]   retrieved all of the
[00:38:15.760 --> 00:38:17.600]   Uh, what are the other was it?
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:19.600]   Are those boosters john
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:21.600]   The first stages
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:25.280]   One of those first stages had been reused 13 times
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:30.320]   Which is the kind of economy nasa can only look at and drool over
[00:38:30.320 --> 00:38:33.280]   Uh, that's really impressive
[00:38:33.840 --> 00:38:38.480]   Now you know we had rod rod pile before you say that whole one more thing
[00:38:38.480 --> 00:38:42.240]   We had red pile on our space guy on sunday. He did something I knew he would do
[00:38:42.240 --> 00:38:49.440]   He said he launched three rockets and 36 hours because elan gets all the credit right of course elan did not
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:51.680]   launch
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:54.160]   Three rockets and 36 hours space x did
[00:38:54.160 --> 00:39:00.080]   And all those great engineers during that period of 36 hours. How many times did elan musk tweet
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:03.600]   about those coin
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:05.920]   The other thing about space x is that
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:09.280]   Yeah, while elan is technically the ceo
[00:39:09.280 --> 00:39:14.800]   He doesn't actually run the company day-to-day. It sounds like he's actually not here very often
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:17.840]   He pretends he does. Yeah, gwen gwen shot. Well runs the company
[00:39:17.840 --> 00:39:21.120]   She she is the sean chief operating officer and president
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:25.600]   But she is the one that really runs the runs the operation day-to-day
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:30.240]   And you know if any if there is any one individual and certainly in something like this
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:34.240]   There is never any one individual that deserves all the credit
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:38.720]   But it you know if there is somebody that deserves credit it would be her not elan
[00:39:38.720 --> 00:39:43.280]   Yeah, yeah, she was the one who fired the letter writers by the way. Yeah
[00:39:43.280 --> 00:39:50.880]   So we'll give her credit for that too. That is a very impressive thing and uh while nasa is struggling getting the sls even to do a
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:56.320]   Uh a fueling test they keep rolling it back off the platform elan watches
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:04.480]   Three rockets in 36 hours. They're about to try again another one. Oh the sls the fueling test for the last yeah
[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:08.400]   Uh how many times have they rolled it back three or four times?
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:14.080]   I think they only rolled it back once they they tried the fueling test three times and they rolled it back
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:19.120]   To the vehicle assembly building and now they've rolled it back out again. I think they're gonna try again this week
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:21.600]   so credit to uh
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:24.000]   elan's company spacex how about that
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:28.240]   And he had the he had the what was it?
[00:40:28.240 --> 00:40:30.240]   Sorry. Go ahead
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:32.000]   Oh, I was just gonna say you know how um
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:37.760]   Spacex sent a tesla up into space. What do you think he'll do if he owns twitter?
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:40.160]   I'm gonna send a big tweet
[00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:42.800]   A big tweet to the moon
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:46.400]   Oh, yeah in the original server up. Yeah
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:51.360]   Get uh get somebody to stamp a tweet out onto the surface of the moon because you know it'll never go away
[00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:53.200]   It'll be there forever
[00:40:53.200 --> 00:40:58.880]   All right, let's take a little break. That's enough elan for the day. I mean I had many many many many many more stories
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:00.560]   I could use but uh
[00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:02.480]   He's trying to get out of the ses
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:08.960]   Seriously elan is the chief newsmaker of the day. He's trying to get out of the sesc deal to have lawyers approve his tweets
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:11.840]   um
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:13.840]   He uh
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:17.120]   Is pumping those I guess we got it. We got them all there you go. That's it. That's all of them
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:22.480]   Uh, yeah, yep. This week in elan has now come to an end
[00:41:22.480 --> 00:41:27.040]   Thank you very much for your attention. We'll be back with something else
[00:41:27.040 --> 00:41:29.760]   And just a bit you might have noticed
[00:41:29.760 --> 00:41:35.440]   I am it didn't say anything, but you might have noticed i'm look a little trim a little fit
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:38.800]   Uh, i've been steadily safely
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:42.800]   Losing weight through noom. I am a fan of noom weight
[00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:46.320]   Um because it's not a diet
[00:41:47.440 --> 00:41:49.440]   It is about learning
[00:41:49.440 --> 00:41:51.920]   About your relationship with food
[00:41:51.920 --> 00:41:54.560]   So that you are conscious
[00:41:54.560 --> 00:42:00.960]   When you eat and then kind of magically you eat better and eat well and there are no forbidden foods
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:08.000]   It's you know, there's a lot of information out there. It's very easy to be overwhelmed by all the information from the wellness industry
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.640]   But noom believes the only place you really need to start is right up here in your mind
[00:42:13.360 --> 00:42:18.720]   With noom weight you take a path toward better health one lesson at a time. It's a psychology based approach
[00:42:18.720 --> 00:42:22.880]   That really helped me change the way i think about it food and health
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:25.600]   Rather than changing my whole lifestyle
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:29.360]   You know, i early on in noom you have a coach you have a group and i've i've
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:34.000]   Shamefacedly said i had a hot dog last night my coach said what are you talking about nothing wrong with that?
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:39.440]   There is no bad foods. Why not i can eat a hot dog. They said yes you log it. Yes. Have you been taking reading the lessons? Yes
[00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:43.920]   It's cognitive behavioral therapy and other scientific principles
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:53.040]   That help you better understand your relationship with food for instance i really learned that when i overeat i do something they call fog eating i'm kind of in a fog
[00:42:53.040 --> 00:42:59.440]   I'm i'm eating for emotional reasons or stress reasons and i'm not even tasting the food noom taught me
[00:42:59.440 --> 00:43:02.960]   To turn off the tv put down the phone sit
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:04.720]   Enjoy
[00:43:04.720 --> 00:43:09.840]   Taste every bite and you know what i just magically by doing that eat less it's kind of remarkable
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:13.760]   Noom understands building long term positive habits can be hard
[00:43:13.760 --> 00:43:19.280]   And filled with ups and downs. It's about progress though not perfection everybody's journey looks different
[00:43:19.280 --> 00:43:27.280]   Noom is fully grounded in science. This is not voodoo. It's it's scientific they've published more than 30
[00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:35.600]   Peer reviewed scientific articles for users practitioners scientists in the public about how their methods work and how effective they are
[00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:40.240]   The idea is get no more stress be empowered
[00:43:40.240 --> 00:43:43.520]   Be empowered because you're taking care of your health
[00:43:43.520 --> 00:43:47.440]   One day off isn't going to ruin the program. Noom helps you get back on track
[00:43:47.440 --> 00:43:52.720]   You decide how it fits into your life not the other way around five 10 15 minutes a day
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:54.880]   I take about 10 minutes a day to read the lessons
[00:43:54.880 --> 00:43:59.520]   With new my log my food so i know what i'm eating it's about being about bringing awareness
[00:43:59.520 --> 00:44:04.400]   Uh to what you're eating but how much time you spend is is up to you
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:07.360]   And the thing is i've been on noom now for a year
[00:44:07.360 --> 00:44:12.000]   And I am about 20 pounds under my starting weight
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:15.440]   And I don't weigh myself every day
[00:44:15.440 --> 00:44:19.680]   It fluctuates and it's that's normal, but I feel better. I'm healthier
[00:44:19.680 --> 00:44:24.240]   All my metrics are better. My doctor's very proud of me

[00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:32.480]   So remember how the EU
[00:45:32.480 --> 00:45:34.880]   Uh
[00:45:34.880 --> 00:45:36.880]   Said we're going to pass a law that requires
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:38.160]   uh
[00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:39.840]   Apple
[00:45:39.840 --> 00:45:44.400]   To well all phone manufacturers, but it's only apple that's not doing it to use us bc
[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:47.360]   well now
[00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:51.520]   Senators have written a bill to uh jina roman doh of the uh
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:54.480]   us commerce secretary
[00:45:55.440 --> 00:45:59.840]   Saying we want to do the same thing bernie sanders elizabeth warren ed markey
[00:45:59.840 --> 00:46:04.160]   are calling on the uh on the uh ftc in the
[00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:06.720]   commerce secretary
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:08.720]   to require
[00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:10.240]   us bc
[00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:12.720]   Chargers by 2024
[00:46:12.720 --> 00:46:19.120]   They cite a figure from the eu saying charges alone would account for about 11 000 tons of e waste
[00:46:19.120 --> 00:46:22.480]   Type c is everywhere else frankly. This is only apple, right?
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:25.920]   I don't think anybody's not using type c at this point. Laptops do
[00:46:25.920 --> 00:46:28.800]   All the android phones do
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:32.640]   It's just apple apple makes somewhere between three and four dollars
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:35.440]   a cable
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:41.920]   For licensing light the lightning cable. So if I were going to make a lightning cable, I'd have to pay apple because it's proprietary
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:45.920]   I'm sure they're reluctant to let that go, but I also see this happening in fact
[00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:48.960]   I think apple's been planning this before 2024
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:52.320]   Any thoughts is this a good thing? My question is I guess
[00:46:52.320 --> 00:46:56.960]   Is there a world in which by 2024 2025
[00:46:56.960 --> 00:47:01.840]   There's a new type of cable that is perhaps better for all of these
[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:05.360]   Things and now we're stuck with the type c and now we're stuck with us bc
[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:07.360]   I mean, I generally don't know is that
[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:11.280]   Not how this works where is us bc going to be here to stay?
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:16.320]   Well, that you know, that's always the reasonable thing when uh government mandates technology
[00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:18.720]   It's like, well, do you know what you're doing?
[00:47:18.720 --> 00:47:22.400]   Yeah, I mean, that's the thing. It seems a little
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:29.600]   Complicated to mandate one sort of cable. I am told I have not read the u uh u regulation
[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:32.640]   But i'm told that u regulation does allow for this
[00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:36.960]   That uh, if a new standard comes along it makes it easy for them
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:43.120]   Uh to support the new so when usbd comes along they can say okay
[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:48.080]   Three years from now you have to switch to usbd right or whatever it might be right?
[00:47:48.080 --> 00:47:50.000]   um
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.880]   I think my my bigger complaint with this is
[00:47:52.880 --> 00:47:56.400]   Does the us congress have nothing better to do?
[00:47:56.400 --> 00:48:02.720]   If you sounds seems like you use already got this covered if eu mandates usbc right
[00:48:02.720 --> 00:48:05.280]   apple's gonna switch to usbc
[00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:07.920]   There's no they're not going to sell
[00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:13.760]   phones with lightning in the us and usbc in europe right they're gonna have they're gonna have one design
[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:15.600]   and
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:20.960]   Why why does our congress have to bother with this you know do something productive?
[00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:30.400]   I I feel like should be uh politics in this nation and really worldwide has become increasingly
[00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:32.960]   Performative
[00:48:33.440 --> 00:48:38.480]   Like you do this because uh you know that a certain percentage of constituents he's gonna say yeah
[00:48:38.480 --> 00:48:40.720]   They're sticking it to big tech love that
[00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:45.440]   Uh, and it doesn't really matter even if this becomes law
[00:48:45.440 --> 00:48:48.240]   it you know, I mean
[00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:50.800]   Maybe bernie believes it
[00:48:50.800 --> 00:48:56.800]   I'm going to be surprised if bernie bernie, you know just says no no this is the right thing to do
[00:48:56.800 --> 00:49:01.600]   But uh, I think it's and this is probably the part of the problem with politics
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:03.840]   Uh, especially in the us but generally
[00:49:03.840 --> 00:49:09.520]   Worldwide is uh, it's not about doing anything. It's about looking like you're doing something
[00:49:09.520 --> 00:49:17.040]   I mean, this is something that i've noticed as over the years when i've been covering kind of the big tech hearings or
[00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:19.440]   social media related hearings is
[00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:26.480]   The first couple times i was like, oh great, you know a lot of debate and discussion around tech related issues antitrust
[00:49:26.480 --> 00:49:29.200]   But what ends up being every single time is just
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:33.280]   the politicians reading from a stump speech that they want
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:39.920]   To have their team clip and share on twitter and facebook so that their constituents can be like, oh wow
[00:49:39.920 --> 00:49:43.120]   They really stuck it to those tech CEOs or wow
[00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:48.560]   They're really asking mark zuckerberg about x-ray and it ultimately ends up being for
[00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:51.440]   No real purpose right?
[00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:55.680]   Doesn't uh doesn't apple
[00:49:56.640 --> 00:50:00.400]   Maybe need some writing in here like they just introduced new macbooks that have
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:07.520]   Surprise the magsafe charger is back which you know like I really like that design if you've ever had it fall off
[00:50:07.520 --> 00:50:10.880]   You know, it's but you can by the way, I'm pretty sure
[00:50:10.880 --> 00:50:15.440]   In fact, I think i've done you can still charge those macbooks with usbc with a type c
[00:50:15.440 --> 00:50:22.720]   connector yeah, moh you have the choice newer computers can like my my hp laptop that I have from my employer
[00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:27.360]   um has a proprietary charger with a barrel connector on it
[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:32.720]   But I can also when I travel I I leave that on my desk and I have a usb c charger
[00:50:32.720 --> 00:50:35.360]   In my in my backpack and I could charge it from that
[00:50:35.360 --> 00:50:39.360]   That's a great compromise because I do think magsafe is better in some situations
[00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:41.280]   um
[00:50:41.280 --> 00:50:45.280]   It's a for one thing, you know when I put my laptop to bed at night because
[00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:48.480]   It sucks it in because it's magnetic
[00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:53.120]   I don't have to you know kind of figure fiddle around and try to find the hole and all that stuff
[00:50:53.120 --> 00:50:58.000]   So it's really I think I like magsafe, but if I didn't have a magsafe adapter with me
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:03.360]   I could still charge it. I don't know why apple would care that much except for this license fee
[00:51:03.360 --> 00:51:06.160]   I mean they already don't put charging bricks
[00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:09.280]   in the uh in the iphone box
[00:51:09.280 --> 00:51:16.640]   Which ironically is making some people angry. I think i think in Brazil they're mad about that
[00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:22.320]   I mean, it's kind of a no-win like if you know included then you're accused of um, you know
[00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:28.880]   Driving up costs and contributing to e-waste. Yeah, and if you don't then people get mad too. Yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah
[00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:34.560]   I will say i'm pretty excited about the new line of max just because they now have a lot of ports
[00:51:34.560 --> 00:51:38.880]   And I mean my mac is not that old. It's 2019 or whatever
[00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:44.400]   So i'm probably not gonna upgrade just now, but I would love to have a computer with more than two ports
[00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:45.920]   Oh, I agree
[00:51:45.920 --> 00:51:48.960]   I agree. I bought the 14 inch macbook pro when I came out last year
[00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:51.360]   It's so nice. I mean I it was like
[00:51:51.360 --> 00:51:57.360]   Who's snuck into apple in the middle of the night put an hdmi port an sd card reader on this thing
[00:51:57.360 --> 00:51:59.200]   It's like
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:04.800]   That is that is going back. That's like uh nostalgia time and I think it's just because johnny and i've left
[00:52:04.800 --> 00:52:08.000]   johnny
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:15.120]   I remember when uh when apple switched switched design and took out the sd card reader totally messed
[00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:20.800]   messed up my live blogging routine because I would you know, I had a nice camera with an sd card
[00:52:20.800 --> 00:52:25.760]   I would take some photos then run back and uh, you know, just swap in the card
[00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:31.200]   I even had two sd cards so I could like keep going. It's awesome. Isn't it? Yeah, and then
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:36.560]   Got a new mac didn't even look to see if it had a reader and
[00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:45.040]   I had no way I didn't bring the usb cable and I had no way of getting the uh the photos off my camera at that next event. Yeah
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:48.000]   Yeah
[00:52:48.000 --> 00:52:52.080]   Uh speaking of back to the future. This was the weak internet explorer
[00:52:52.080 --> 00:52:54.960]   died
[00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:57.520]   Oh the end of the line
[00:52:57.520 --> 00:53:00.000]   Um
[00:53:00.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   More internet left to explore
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.200]   I guess it's over
[00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:10.560]   It is kind of retro. It is like you remember web surfing, you know, yeah
[00:53:10.560 --> 00:53:13.040]   Yeah
[00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:16.320]   27 years I think I remember uh
[00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:19.680]   When I
[00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:21.680]   Three came out it was
[00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:24.720]   1996
[00:53:24.720 --> 00:53:29.440]   That's that's game was still charging right you had to buy netscape
[00:53:29.440 --> 00:53:33.040]   And microsoft said just get our browser for free
[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:38.480]   And when the version I guess it was 3.0 came out that was as good as net
[00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:42.480]   You know, I you could justify paying for netscape with the earlier versions of i.e
[00:53:43.360 --> 00:53:46.160]   But when it came out as good as netscape for free
[00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:51.280]   I said in fact I said this one tv on msm pc. I said
[00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:54.400]   kiss it goodbye by by netscape
[00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:58.880]   Uh, i.e is free and it's going to take over the world
[00:53:58.880 --> 00:54:04.000]   And I was told later that mark and dreason was watching in this he was of course the founder of
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:11.040]   netscape was watching msm pc and came screaming down the hall saying who the hell is this guy
[00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:13.920]   But I was right
[00:54:13.920 --> 00:54:20.320]   But every time I see you on my tv screen as well. Who the hell is this guy? What's he think he's talking about?
[00:54:20.320 --> 00:54:25.200]   Uh, and of course, uh netscape went away. It was the end of the line
[00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:33.280]   And what happened next is that microsoft of course neglected to develop internet explore right particularly on the mac
[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:35.280]   and um
[00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:37.280]   Steve jobs got so frustrated
[00:54:38.240 --> 00:54:42.800]   With the bad performance of i.e for the mac that he started the safari project
[00:54:42.800 --> 00:54:49.840]   It was actually a story on wired that that asked, you know, why is i.e for the mac so bad and they benchmarked it against i.e
[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:55.120]   On the pc and that was the beginning of it was a pig it was a harm and it crashed
[00:54:55.120 --> 00:54:57.920]   In fact, I have let me see
[00:54:57.920 --> 00:55:04.560]   There's a site. I bookmarked it here somewhere that brings back the you know the probably a most remembered
[00:55:05.520 --> 00:55:08.480]   Feature of internet explorer. Let me see if I can uh
[00:55:08.480 --> 00:55:12.160]   I can find this i bookmarked it some time ago
[00:55:12.160 --> 00:55:15.040]   Because I just you know sometimes you get a little nostalgic
[00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:24.800]   Here it is. It's lagplorer.tms.sx ready show my screen because I want it so it's the best loved feature of internet explorer
[00:55:24.800 --> 00:55:27.920]   When it crashed
[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:33.840]   It would do this you could paint the screen with the crash dialogue remember this
[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:36.480]   You just uh that's it uh
[00:55:36.480 --> 00:55:43.120]   You're getting ptsp from that. I think internet explorer though has a future as a street wear brand
[00:55:43.120 --> 00:55:48.160]   Like imagine this all over a jacket. Oh straight fire. That's a nice. Yeah
[00:55:48.160 --> 00:55:52.320]   You gotta just keep doing it till it's just right. Yeah
[00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:54.720]   Yeah, or maybe some uh
[00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:57.920]   Bed linens my sheet and pillowcases could look like that
[00:55:57.920 --> 00:56:00.400]   Brook linen needs to get on it
[00:56:01.600 --> 00:56:09.680]   There there are actually some crypto websites that have this like retro gray background, you know kind of blocky tabs
[00:56:09.680 --> 00:56:14.400]   Look that's very throwback to internet explorer. Oh, that's hysterical
[00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:17.760]   I don't know why that look is is trendy, but Paris I think
[00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:20.640]   It's the retro. Yeah, it's the retro vibes
[00:56:20.640 --> 00:56:26.800]   Do you remember you're not old enough to remember? Did you use i.e? Paris? Do you are you old enough to remember those? Yeah? Yeah
[00:56:26.800 --> 00:56:29.040]   I used i.e. Yeah
[00:56:29.040 --> 00:56:33.840]   I guess we we call kind of head to wall street journal had the strangest article about this
[00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:37.280]   Um sure internet explorer had its faults
[00:56:37.280 --> 00:56:40.640]   They wrote but fans are mourning its death
[00:56:40.640 --> 00:56:43.680]   Anyway, here's a 22 year old kid
[00:56:43.680 --> 00:56:52.240]   Three windows of internet. Yes. He doesn't let me tell you something. Let me read you some of the quotes from the people they say
[00:56:52.240 --> 00:56:55.040]   use internet explorer
[00:56:55.200 --> 00:57:01.200]   Uh sam maamalanga 31 year old Polynesian dance instructor from ulyss texas
[00:57:01.200 --> 00:57:08.400]   Said this is the wall street journal folks. I'm still trying to process it. I've used it for so long
[00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:11.520]   It's the first thing I get on my laptop
[00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:18.000]   Wait, is that a woodcut stipple of the yes, it's a woodcut stipple of the i.e
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:20.960]   I've always wanted a woodcut stipple of me, but
[00:57:22.080 --> 00:57:26.880]   No, i got it. So first of all it comes in your laptop sam. You don't have to get it
[00:57:26.880 --> 00:57:29.040]   That was
[00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:33.760]   My guess is none of the people quoted in this article ever used never actually used it
[00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:40.560]   Yeah, but they probably responded to a treat from from the writer looking for internet explorer users and thought hey
[00:57:40.560 --> 00:57:46.080]   This is a way to get some attention for my instagram account or my exactly or whatever
[00:57:46.080 --> 00:57:50.800]   Polynesian dance instructor from ulyss texas notice that was in there
[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:57.760]   uh matt lynkert the 22 four mentioned 22 year old tick tocker from peter burrow ontario
[00:57:57.760 --> 00:58:00.800]   It's sad to see it go
[00:58:00.800 --> 00:58:05.280]   No, he doesn't care. He doesn't care. This is is another one
[00:58:05.280 --> 00:58:10.880]   jony kacie a 67 year old retiree in elikot city maryland
[00:58:10.880 --> 00:58:14.400]   Says the internet explorer browser is quote
[00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:17.600]   One of the three i got to do it in the right voice
[00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:20.800]   One of the three that pop up on my shell phone
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:26.960]   What we the only person that i believe actually uses i don't think it
[00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:32.240]   Pops up on your cell phone. We have two she might she might be still using an old
[00:58:32.240 --> 00:58:37.200]   Windows mold she must be using a windows phone because that's the only phone i.e. He was ever on as far as i can
[00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:39.200]   How is yeah, how is that?
[00:58:39.200 --> 00:58:47.200]   We have windows phone. What are the two other ones? No, exactly. It's this is made up. We have a man
[00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:49.040]   Go ahead
[00:58:49.040 --> 00:58:53.760]   I'm just imagining that she uh has holding a laptop up to her face every single day
[00:58:53.760 --> 00:58:56.160]   And it's like one of the three things on here
[00:58:56.160 --> 00:58:58.560]   My cell phone
[00:58:58.560 --> 00:59:03.920]   We have too many choices. She says i sort of feel like the fewer the choices the better
[00:59:03.920 --> 00:59:06.960]   I guess now only two things will pop up in herself
[00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:14.080]   Oh, well, you know, it's hard to write a uh, what do they call these in journalism?
[00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:22.560]   Oh, and a think piece about i.e. A lifestyle piece. This is like a non-think piece. This is a we were not
[00:59:22.560 --> 00:59:24.400]   you know
[00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:28.560]   No, it's piece actually i i would use this as like
[00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:35.840]   uh, you know like an instructional piece on how to fact check like okay just because this person said
[00:59:35.840 --> 00:59:42.720]   That i.e. pops up on their cell phone. Okay. Did they show it to you? Did you like is that?
[00:59:43.280 --> 00:59:47.520]   Actually possible like you don't do a quick google search to see if that was doable
[00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:50.800]   If there was any phone that ever ran i.e. Oh
[00:59:50.800 --> 00:59:57.040]   I mean, it's true that she said it is it actually true, but I don't know i'm kind of
[00:59:57.040 --> 01:00:02.240]   I I would I would have questions. Yeah, I were editing. Yeah. Yeah
[01:00:02.240 --> 01:00:06.960]   Well, at least they got the story, right?
[01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:14.080]   At least they got the stipple are they got the stipple? Do you think they computer generate that now?
[01:00:14.080 --> 01:00:19.520]   I mean, sure in the early days it was so i'm sure that dolly is just pumping out wall street journal stipple
[01:00:19.520 --> 01:00:21.520]   I think that there's actually a
[01:00:21.520 --> 01:00:26.720]   A website you can go to to generate kind of a wonky stipple of whatever you put in it. I
[01:00:26.720 --> 01:00:30.720]   It's one of the great disappointments of my life
[01:00:30.720 --> 01:00:33.760]   Some years ago when I was on tech tv
[01:00:33.840 --> 01:00:41.040]   I was interviewed for a piece in the wall street journal and I was god. I was hoping please put stipple me
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:44.560]   I was just praying for this and they killed the piece and ever ran it
[01:00:44.560 --> 01:00:49.680]   So I I feel like I came this close and maybe there is a stipple of me somewhere in the archives
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:53.040]   Of the wall street journal if there's an internal listening would you please look?
[01:00:53.040 --> 01:00:55.680]   I want my stipple here in korea
[01:00:55.680 --> 01:01:00.560]   You pick up the phone from a wall street journal reporter and you're like, okay. I can talk to you
[01:01:00.560 --> 01:01:06.240]   But can you give me a stiff? I you know, it's like desperate with the rolling stone calls put me on the cover man
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:12.960]   All I ever wanted was a stipple. Here's a uh, viral gravestone from korea
[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:18.000]   internet explorer 1995 august 17th to 2022
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:20.080]   June 15th
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:23.120]   He was a good tool to download other browsers
[01:01:23.120 --> 01:01:26.400]   About all it was good says it all right
[01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:32.880]   Do you think this is real? I hope this is I hope it's not a wallie. We're gonna have to we're gonna dolly
[01:01:32.880 --> 01:01:36.160]   We're gonna have to start asking every time we see something like this. Is that a dolly?
[01:01:36.160 --> 01:01:39.120]   Is that generated is it real it looks real?
[01:01:39.120 --> 01:01:44.400]   Looks really really browser wars were exciting though like it was they were fun to cover
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:50.800]   Back in the 90s like remember remember when a bunch of rogue microsoft employees dumped a giant
[01:01:50.800 --> 01:01:54.720]   Uh blue e on the mod of netscape
[01:01:55.520 --> 01:01:57.520]   remember there was a funeral
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:01.680]   There was like a funeral procession at a complex one year
[01:02:01.680 --> 01:02:05.200]   They had netscape in a coffin
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:11.600]   Oh my god, sure you're not thinking of sure you're not thinking of a mac world when they brought out
[01:02:11.600 --> 01:02:18.800]   Macolas or classic macolas and macolas nine in a coffin. Maybe maybe this happened more than once. I don't know
[01:02:18.800 --> 01:02:24.160]   Uh, yeah, it could just be a fever dream. I might be imagining
[01:02:24.880 --> 01:02:31.440]   I'd be imagining them early browser died so that what it was uh mr. Nut or baby nut could rise
[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:37.680]   The the two different ad campaigns that I remember uh, you know, baby nut
[01:02:37.680 --> 01:02:43.520]   Do you remember this uh the nutter butter guy? This was right when the pandemic started they killed off
[01:02:43.520 --> 01:02:45.760]   Oh, mr. Peanut they killed off mr. Peanut
[01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:49.680]   Baby nut that's kind of what happened to the browser, you know
[01:02:49.680 --> 01:02:51.440]   You know, it's funny
[01:02:51.440 --> 01:02:57.520]   I was talking about this on Tuesday because Andy and Akko was eating a can of planter's cheese balls
[01:02:57.520 --> 01:03:02.960]   And it had mr. Peanut on it and I said wait a minute they killed him
[01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:10.720]   Wait a minute. He's dead. He's dead. You can't have him on a can of cheese balls
[01:03:10.720 --> 01:03:17.200]   All right, we're gonna have to do some research and see if either and he got a five-year-old can of cheese balls
[01:03:17.200 --> 01:03:18.800]   Or
[01:03:18.800 --> 01:03:22.560]   That was all just a marketing ploy hard to believe
[01:03:22.560 --> 01:03:28.960]   No, no company would ever do something like that. I am gonna show mr. Peanut or Superman
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:32.320]   And he thought he was all that because he was using um chopsticks
[01:03:32.320 --> 01:03:36.560]   To eat the cheese balls and so Anthony Nielsen gave me these
[01:03:36.560 --> 01:03:41.280]   Uh, you can be doing your work. You can be typing these are called conjoined
[01:03:41.280 --> 01:03:44.160]   chopstick snack clips
[01:03:44.560 --> 01:03:49.840]   And so you can reach into the jar pick up a cheese ball. I john we got to get some cheese balls for Tuesday
[01:03:49.840 --> 01:03:53.760]   to make ant Andy jealous look at that they even have like
[01:03:53.760 --> 01:03:57.600]   Fine karenthian leather embossing
[01:03:57.600 --> 01:04:00.400]   Oh my god
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:05.680]   You want these tell me you don't want these you should get a can of pre
[01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:10.560]   mr. Peanut death cheese balls and post baby nut
[01:04:10.560 --> 01:04:13.360]   Baby nut cheese balls
[01:04:13.360 --> 01:04:15.360]   I got one for every one for every hand
[01:04:15.360 --> 01:04:21.360]   I mean like Wolverine if Wolverine were a fat guy who ate cheese balls
[01:04:21.360 --> 01:04:26.560]   Uh, the the the eating you know eating greasy salty
[01:04:26.560 --> 01:04:29.120]   snacks with chopsticks
[01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:32.160]   Innovation is brilliant. It's brilliant. It slows you down
[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:34.880]   You don't get orange on your hands
[01:04:34.880 --> 01:04:37.840]   Uh, and you look damn cool
[01:04:39.280 --> 01:04:44.480]   I don't know. I think you're missing out in half the flavor though half the experience of eating cheese balls is licking the cheese
[01:04:44.480 --> 01:04:50.800]   Death's off your fingers and feeling a deep sense of shame. That's oddly specific Paris
[01:04:50.800 --> 01:04:54.720]   I don't know what you're talking about universal experience
[01:04:54.720 --> 01:05:02.000]   Well, and then but I mean also looking looking off whatever's on your keyboard as well. Well or your alcantara
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:08.880]   Do you remember somebody tested alcantara on the uh on the microsoft surface laptop? They have that fake
[01:05:09.840 --> 01:05:16.720]   fabric surface somebody actually did rub Cheetos into it to see if it would hold the orange and it does
[01:05:16.720 --> 01:05:20.880]   Just now, you know
[01:05:20.880 --> 01:05:22.640]   More you know
[01:05:22.640 --> 01:05:24.960]   Some more you know is it your local library kids?
[01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:27.920]   um
[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:31.280]   Leaked audio from 80 internal tik-tok meetings
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:39.040]   I don't even care about this shows that us user data has been repeatedly accessed from
[01:05:39.040 --> 01:05:42.800]   China
[01:05:42.800 --> 01:05:49.840]   So leah do you not care about this uh from that from like the same way scott mcnilly famously said
[01:05:49.840 --> 01:05:54.560]   You have no privacy any way get over it or like you just assume that china was
[01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:57.440]   Uh looking at and what are they getting?
[01:05:57.440 --> 01:06:00.640]   I mean, what are they getting that's so bad
[01:06:02.560 --> 01:06:06.880]   They know exactly how many people watch that i walk interior design video
[01:06:06.880 --> 01:06:09.440]   Yes
[01:06:09.440 --> 01:06:13.760]   And then i'm looking for bikini rich content at least that's what they think
[01:06:13.760 --> 01:06:18.960]   But it's just a psycho it's a psycho i'm trying to fool them
[01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:22.160]   uh, i'm the only person who's
[01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:27.760]   Still so paranoid that like i have not downloaded the tik-tok app on any of my devices
[01:06:27.760 --> 01:06:31.920]   But what do you i'm really i'm serious. What are you afraid of i do know like and i'm not
[01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:34.400]   You know like i'm not that paranoid and
[01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:36.960]   other things but i was just like
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:45.440]   Or maybe it was just social media overload i was like, okay i do not need another another like that is a very sensible plan
[01:06:45.440 --> 01:06:48.560]   In fact i have reasons apparently you just don't care
[01:06:48.560 --> 01:06:51.600]   I mean that that's what it is for me. I just don't care
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:54.320]   yeah, it kind of feels like
[01:06:54.320 --> 01:06:59.680]   Multiple things kind of boiling up to just like i am not going to download this
[01:07:01.200 --> 01:07:04.240]   My son i have to because my son is a tik-tok star
[01:07:04.240 --> 01:07:07.680]   2.2 million followers
[01:07:07.680 --> 01:07:10.000]   Drop the handle. Yeah, yeah
[01:07:10.000 --> 01:07:13.360]   Well, i think everybody knows by now it's salt hank
[01:07:13.360 --> 01:07:16.800]   Uh, in fact he's so famous now in tik-tok
[01:07:16.800 --> 01:07:19.120]   that uh
[01:07:19.120 --> 01:07:21.840]   People are saying to me, do you know, are you related to salt hank?
[01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:29.680]   So it's it's like it's it's on you know the battle your home is technically a content house
[01:07:30.800 --> 01:07:34.640]   It's not a content house to content. Well, he's 27. He's not living with me
[01:07:34.640 --> 01:07:38.240]   It's not although although i have to say a lot of his
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:41.840]   Videos are shot in his mother's kitchen because she's such a nice kitchen
[01:07:41.840 --> 01:07:44.720]   He borrows her kitchen
[01:07:44.720 --> 01:07:52.640]   2.1 million followers 35 and a half million likes so all of our best cooking recipes are now known by china
[01:07:52.640 --> 01:07:55.840]   dangerous
[01:07:55.840 --> 01:08:00.160]   Mm-hmm. The world will never be the same. I have to talk to uh this young man
[01:08:00.560 --> 01:08:04.960]   This is uh emily baker white's story in buzzfeed. They they discovered this
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:11.360]   Leaked audio from ad internal tik-tok meeting shows that us user data has been repeatedly accessed from china
[01:08:11.360 --> 01:08:14.000]   quote
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:20.400]   Get ready. I feel like with these tools there's some backdoor to access user data and almost all of them says an external auditor
[01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:26.000]   hired to help tik-tok close off chinese access to sensitive information like
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.760]   Americans birthdays and phone numbers
[01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:32.080]   Oh
[01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:37.680]   If I get a call from china then i'll know especially if they call me to say happy birthday
[01:08:37.680 --> 01:08:42.240]   That'll be I just that'll be obvious. I just found googling
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:45.920]   Discover ukraine misinformation on tik-tok
[01:08:45.920 --> 01:08:49.760]   So, you know, I think there are real world
[01:08:49.760 --> 01:08:52.320]   There's a legit no I agree
[01:08:52.320 --> 01:08:55.280]   It's not that china is spying on us so much as that
[01:08:55.920 --> 01:09:00.800]   tik-tok like any social media can be used to spread disinformation to prop agandize
[01:09:00.800 --> 01:09:03.920]   I don't think
[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:07.200]   You could elect the next us president with tik-tok
[01:09:07.200 --> 01:09:12.960]   You might say that you know president trump in 2016 was elected not
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:16.960]   solely but with a lot of help from facebook and twitter, right
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:23.920]   Uh, but I don't think tik-tok could elect somebody. Do you think the chinese are gonna say oh, let's you know
[01:09:23.920 --> 01:09:29.840]   Let's elect biden. He's our puppet so he should win in 2024 and then there'll be all these positive biden tik-toks
[01:09:29.840 --> 01:09:32.080]   I don't think so I think it's more subtle right?
[01:09:32.080 --> 01:09:33.280]   It's like you know
[01:09:33.280 --> 01:09:39.520]   If you if you just kind of pull an elon musk and say oh free speech, you know, we're just letting people express them to sell
[01:09:39.520 --> 01:09:45.520]   And and you just take your foot off the you know off the break a little and let things spread
[01:09:45.520 --> 01:09:48.000]   Does that do enough by itself?
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:52.720]   So you don't have to actively promote this stuff you just kind of you know
[01:09:53.360 --> 01:10:00.720]   Like neglect it and right, you know, well, that's what tedd cruz says. He says tik-tok is quote a trojan horse
[01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:06.720]   The chinese communist party can use to influence what americans see here and ultimately think
[01:10:06.720 --> 01:10:11.920]   I just think it's a great way to learn how to make a sandwich
[01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:14.880]   but
[01:10:14.880 --> 01:10:16.720]   But you know that's me
[01:10:16.720 --> 01:10:20.240]   um tik-toks response to this and I don't know if this is better
[01:10:20.800 --> 01:10:23.840]   Was to move all of the americans data to oracle
[01:10:23.840 --> 01:10:31.120]   So now who would you rather have this information the chinese government or oracle?
[01:10:31.120 --> 01:10:36.080]   Have you read that uh that recent story about
[01:10:36.080 --> 01:10:42.640]   How larry elison runs the island of lonai which he owns 90 old zal island. Yeah, yeah
[01:10:42.640 --> 01:10:48.880]   Um, tell me about it. It's beautiful island. I believe it was in forbs
[01:10:49.440 --> 01:10:54.800]   It bloomberg business week. I've got the cover for sitting next to me that I need to read it. Oh show us the cover
[01:10:54.800 --> 01:11:00.240]   It's actually oh no, you don't have to get up. That's all right. My apologies to bloomberg business week
[01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:06.800]   Uh, but it's by the way, uh, we have a rule on twit that if you say that it has to be bloom big beige week
[01:11:06.800 --> 01:11:09.600]   lord of lonai
[01:11:09.600 --> 01:11:17.600]   We week so now he's the lord of lonai and the tyrant of tik-tok tiren of tik-tok the lord of lonai
[01:11:18.320 --> 01:11:25.040]   The oracle billionaires making his hawaiian island more hospitable to the super rich and pushing out families
[01:11:25.040 --> 01:11:28.960]   That have been there for generations. Well, that's the story of hawai frankly
[01:11:28.960 --> 01:11:31.680]   Uh for the last 500 years
[01:11:31.680 --> 01:11:37.680]   Um was lonai the leper island or no that was maulakai maulakai. Yeah
[01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:45.680]   Uh, but there's still people who've been living there for quite a while. Here's a guy named andrews who does not look like a native hawaiian
[01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:48.240]   He was kicked out of his house in the past year
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:50.960]   But I got to point out
[01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:52.960]   Andrews is you know
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:58.240]   Four bearers probably an english sailor kicked some other native hawaiian in their house
[01:11:58.240 --> 01:12:04.720]   Uh, this is the story of hawaiy sad to say wow. Oh, I didn't see when I looked at your cover
[01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:07.120]   That he's wearing, uh
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:09.040]   What are those nickerers? What do you call that one the?
[01:12:09.040 --> 01:12:11.600]   Looks like a little lord ponloorai
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:16.720]   Paddle wounds. He's wearing paddle wounds. I love that
[01:12:16.720 --> 01:12:19.680]   Paddle wounds a black turtleneck
[01:12:19.680 --> 01:12:24.320]   Little lord elison little lord larry
[01:12:24.320 --> 01:12:27.520]   Uh
[01:12:27.520 --> 01:12:32.640]   Yeah, I think it's right. I don't know. I'm married many moons ago didn't he get married on lonai
[01:12:32.640 --> 01:12:37.120]   They had a private wedding there and all the famous fancy people
[01:12:37.120 --> 01:12:40.880]   Uh, he also I think he's built
[01:12:40.880 --> 01:12:47.120]   Uh, isn't that where the rich the new rich carlton one? Uh, when I is there yeah, there it is. That's the four seasons. I mean
[01:12:47.120 --> 01:12:54.160]   They've got two of them. Yeah, can cost thousands or tens of thousands. Isn't that eight seasons technically?
[01:12:54.160 --> 01:12:59.280]   Is two four seasons eight seasons?
[01:12:59.280 --> 01:13:03.280]   And where do the extra seasons go or is it exponential is it 16?
[01:13:03.280 --> 01:13:10.160]   All right, I'm gonna I'm gonna do a little fact checking or a little real-time fact checking. I'm gonna try to book a room
[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:12.960]   at the four seasons lonai

[01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:30.080]   But it's apparently giving up the ghost it might have it might have overheated

[01:18:21.920 --> 01:18:25.440]   5,800 hours worth of training and it's up to date
[01:18:25.440 --> 01:18:29.200]   They've got seven studios running all day and all night well not all night
[01:18:29.200 --> 01:18:35.360]   But all day to create the content that goes in the library within 24 hours of its recording
[01:18:35.360 --> 01:18:37.360]   So it's always up to date
[01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:41.200]   And you'll love the business plan dashboard would let you track your team results
[01:18:41.200 --> 01:18:45.760]   You can manage seats on an assign and assign team members access monthly usage reports
[01:18:45.760 --> 01:18:51.680]   Make sure your team's using it effectively see metrics like logins and viewing time and tracks completed and more
[01:18:51.680 --> 01:18:55.600]   They're reporting. It's great. So you could show the boss look we're getting the value out of this
[01:18:55.600 --> 01:19:02.720]   People are learning so you get the insight into your team's viewing patterns and progress with beautiful visual reports
[01:19:03.440 --> 01:19:09.120]   You can assign full courses or individual episodes within the courses every course has a beautiful transcript
[01:19:09.120 --> 01:19:12.960]   So it's easy to find the part of the course that your team needs training in
[01:19:12.960 --> 01:19:16.960]   You can assign individuals subsets of users whole teams
[01:19:16.960 --> 01:19:23.120]   And of course it pro tv has great individual plans to give your team the it development platform
[01:19:23.120 --> 01:19:28.080]   They need to level up their skills while enjoying the journey for teams of two to a thousand
[01:19:28.080 --> 01:19:31.360]   And volume discounts started five seats

[01:20:11.360 --> 01:20:14.640]   I uh, I just turned it on and turned it off
[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:20.000]   Or turned it off and turned it on again gave it the old router every hour and a half. It's going to do that
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:23.520]   Listen, I mean when the talk is this spicy
[01:20:23.520 --> 01:20:26.480]   It got all excited about going to Hawaii
[01:20:27.280 --> 01:20:29.120]   Uh
[01:20:29.120 --> 01:20:35.760]   Let's talk about this because we've got sam here auto guy sammable samad principal research at a guide house insights
[01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:38.080]   podcast host
[01:20:38.080 --> 01:20:40.080]   uh, wheel bearings dot media
[01:20:40.080 --> 01:20:41.520]   the uh
[01:20:41.520 --> 01:20:46.720]   Folks at the national highway transportation safety administration. We call nitza
[01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:49.760]   Have put out uh, their
[01:20:49.760 --> 01:20:54.800]   Standing general order on crash reporting they're investigating
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:20:59.440]   crashes on uh advanced driver assist
[01:20:59.440 --> 01:21:01.760]   systems
[01:21:01.760 --> 01:21:07.120]   Teslas are they particularly looking at tesla? We're just all eight systems this this came
[01:21:07.120 --> 01:21:10.560]   Um, the the order originally came out a year ago
[01:21:10.560 --> 01:21:14.080]   after they started doing an investigation into
[01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:21.680]   A couple of dozen Teslas that had crashed into stationary fire trucks and police vehicle emergency vehicles
[01:21:22.160 --> 01:21:30.480]   While on autopilot. Yeah, and so this particular order applies to all automakers suppliers and
[01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:36.240]   uh companies developing automated driving systems so this includes companies like Waymo and cruise and
[01:21:36.240 --> 01:21:38.720]   Argo AI and others
[01:21:38.720 --> 01:21:44.080]   Um, and what they have to do is within 24 hours of finding out they have to report
[01:21:44.080 --> 01:21:50.080]   Um, any crashes that involve either driver assistance or automated driving system
[01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:54.000]   um being active within 30 seconds of the crash
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:59.360]   So if the system was active and then shuts off and and then within 30 seconds you have a crash
[01:21:59.360 --> 01:22:01.600]   They have to report that why that
[01:22:01.600 --> 01:22:04.160]   Was it that anybody was you know
[01:22:04.160 --> 01:22:06.880]   Switching them off right before a crash
[01:22:06.880 --> 01:22:10.400]   Well, uh, it's not so much that people were switching them off
[01:22:10.400 --> 01:22:16.160]   But there's been a lot of speculation, you know, there's been a lot of reports over the years from tesla owners in particular
[01:22:16.160 --> 01:22:19.520]   that uh got into crashes and they said
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:26.160]   Um, you know, my my car it was an autopilot and it crashed and you know tesla looked at the data and said, nope
[01:22:26.160 --> 01:22:28.560]   Autopilot was not active at the time of the crash
[01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:35.760]   But despite lots of questions over the years and I know I asked tesla multiple times over the years, you know
[01:22:35.760 --> 01:22:39.360]   in any of these crashes
[01:22:39.360 --> 01:22:47.680]   Was the system active, you know a few seconds before the crash because the the user interface in these cars is often not entirely clear
[01:22:47.680 --> 01:22:52.560]   What mojorin is not it's not obvious meant much of the time if the system has deactivated
[01:22:52.560 --> 01:22:55.040]   And if you weren't paying enough attention
[01:22:55.040 --> 01:23:00.080]   That you know, you might think they're still active and then you know you get a crash and you think it's active
[01:23:00.080 --> 01:23:08.000]   But it wasn't which is why they act and why nitza asked for it to be the data to be any any time the system was active within 30 seconds of a crash
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:11.440]   I had heard and maybe this is a scurrilous
[01:23:11.440 --> 01:23:13.200]   allegation
[01:23:13.200 --> 01:23:17.120]   That tesla was intentionally doing that so that elon could say
[01:23:18.080 --> 01:23:20.880]   Completely accurately as he has done many times
[01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:25.200]   Self-driving was not turned on at the time of the crash
[01:23:25.200 --> 01:23:28.800]   Is that is that just?
[01:23:28.800 --> 01:23:30.560]   Scurrilous or is or you think there's some merit?
[01:23:30.560 --> 01:23:38.560]   I I don't think that they would intentionally turn it off or I mean it's entirely possible. They might fudge the data
[01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:41.360]   I you know, I'm not accusing them of that
[01:23:42.000 --> 01:23:48.800]   But I think what is very reasonable is that you know in a lot of these situations the system did deactivate
[01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:52.800]   You know when the car was going down the road the driver thought it was still active
[01:23:52.800 --> 01:23:56.480]   And you know did not take control when they should have
[01:23:56.480 --> 01:24:02.240]   And then the car crashed and this is why I think it's important to have this data. Unfortunately
[01:24:02.240 --> 01:24:09.840]   Um, the other thing that nitza did is they allowed these companies to declare certain bits of information
[01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:12.240]   uh confidential business information
[01:24:12.240 --> 01:24:13.360]   um
[01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:16.480]   And so while the the data is reported to nitza
[01:24:16.480 --> 01:24:21.680]   Um when they really when nitza finally released the first batch of this data this week
[01:24:21.680 --> 01:24:26.000]   Uh, you know, there were about 393 crashes
[01:24:26.000 --> 01:24:30.640]   Uh that were reported 273 of which involved tesla vehicles
[01:24:30.640 --> 01:24:36.480]   Here's the graph is this because tesla reports more accurately more often or is
[01:24:38.160 --> 01:24:43.840]   No, I don't think so. Yeah, I think I think it's you know that they're they're just crashing more frequently. Uh, is that because
[01:24:43.840 --> 01:24:47.360]   Well, I mean if they have more cars with a'd ass
[01:24:47.360 --> 01:24:52.720]   Out there don't they uh no no not really not necessarily
[01:24:52.720 --> 01:24:57.280]   Um, you know because this includes, you know a wide variety of different systems and
[01:24:57.280 --> 01:25:03.200]   You know, they're like for example the hondas, you know that this next second highest number was honda with 90
[01:25:03.600 --> 01:25:09.840]   Uh, but you know arguably that you know the honda vehicles shouldn't have even been included in here because you know
[01:25:09.840 --> 01:25:15.840]   what they call level two systems or systems that control both steering and speed and if the
[01:25:15.840 --> 01:25:24.320]   um if the uh, you know the honda the honda system the two systems the steering control the link keeping assist and the speed control are
[01:25:24.320 --> 01:25:27.040]   separate systems they're not consolidated
[01:25:27.040 --> 01:25:31.040]   Um, and but you know the thing is I looked through the data
[01:25:31.280 --> 01:25:34.800]   Yeah, I read through the the the the excel file that they that they released
[01:25:34.800 --> 01:25:42.160]   And in the descriptions of the crashes I looked at all the honda crashes none of them were none of the crashes were actually
[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:48.800]   Uh cases where the the a'd ass was the problem. It was always you know the car would you know had
[01:25:48.800 --> 01:25:57.280]   Adaptive cruise control and link keeping assist on went through an intersection and a car ran a stop sign and struck the car in the side
[01:25:57.280 --> 01:26:00.000]   You know things like that. So it was all unrelated stuff
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:05.200]   but because uh nitza allowed um information to be redacted
[01:26:05.200 --> 01:26:11.360]   I looked through all 273 tesla related crashes. They redacted the descriptions. So we haven't
[01:26:11.360 --> 01:26:19.840]   You know nitza has the data, but we cannot we do not know what happened in those so these gray wedges of this pie on
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:22.480]   on these crashes
[01:26:22.480 --> 01:26:29.760]   Unknown means not that nitza doesn't know but they're not telling well in some in some cases they they actually don't know
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:34.560]   Okay, you know because it depends you know depends on how the data was reported
[01:26:34.560 --> 01:26:38.320]   So there's cases where they they actually don't know what the root cause was
[01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:45.520]   Um, this is a really interesting. I mean very complete. I like driver assist systems. I've used them on teslas
[01:26:45.520 --> 01:26:48.560]   I've used them on outy. I have it now in my ford maki
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:53.680]   You know that's adaptive cruise control. That's that's an a-dass system, isn't it?
[01:26:53.680 --> 01:26:54.880]   Yeah
[01:26:54.880 --> 01:27:00.320]   No, it absolutely is where it slows down and when the cars in front of you slow down and speeds up when they speed up
[01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:01.680]   uh
[01:27:01.680 --> 01:27:05.520]   Lane changing is available in blue cruise and gms
[01:27:05.520 --> 01:27:09.600]   Um, whatever cruise they call that one super cruise
[01:27:09.600 --> 01:27:13.680]   Uh rights you the automatic lane changing that would be a dass
[01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:15.360]   Uh
[01:27:15.360 --> 01:27:20.800]   Does anybody attempt to do as much as tesla does though that they're their autopilot is
[01:27:21.840 --> 01:27:27.760]   Works for instance not just on highways like super cruise and blue cruise, but on city streets
[01:27:27.760 --> 01:27:33.200]   Supposedly it it sees stop signs and stop lights and reacts properly to them
[01:27:33.200 --> 01:27:39.920]   Is anybody else sees them it doesn't necessarily react properly. I know sometimes it does it two different things there. Yeah, um, yeah
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:44.640]   It sees it sees uh, is he speed limit signs and reacts to those? Yeah
[01:27:45.280 --> 01:27:52.000]   Yeah, I mean no no one has gone as far as what tesla has done at least from a marketing perspective
[01:27:52.000 --> 01:27:58.400]   Um, and maybe that's part of the problem is that i mean tesla tells you it's as it's an autopilot
[01:27:58.400 --> 01:28:00.880]   So tesla drivers
[01:28:00.880 --> 01:28:04.880]   That's a fundamental problem here. Yeah, you know is the way that they brand it
[01:28:04.880 --> 01:28:09.920]   Um, you know both blue cruise and super cruise allow actual hands free driving
[01:28:09.920 --> 01:28:13.280]   Um, so you can take your hands off the wheel you still have to watch the road
[01:28:14.080 --> 01:28:18.400]   Technically with autopilot you're supposed to keep your hands on the wheel at all times
[01:28:18.400 --> 01:28:22.480]   It's not supposed to be hands free and they don't just doesn't sound like i'm monitoring
[01:28:22.480 --> 01:28:29.520]   Right, sorry owner. Oh, and oh it just you know autopilot suggests that right
[01:28:29.520 --> 01:28:33.760]   You know, you can which is exactly why you have these crashes because people
[01:28:33.760 --> 01:28:37.120]   Uh assume that it's capable of more than it actually is
[01:28:37.120 --> 01:28:40.480]   Yeah, that's that's a marketing problem
[01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:43.280]   Uh, it shouldn't be called autopilot
[01:28:43.440 --> 01:28:47.680]   Blue cruise super cruise those don't imply that the plane will fly itself
[01:28:47.680 --> 01:28:55.280]   Um, Sam is there is there a secrecy problem in the self-driving industry because i saw that waymo has also been trying to
[01:28:55.280 --> 01:28:58.720]   Redact crash data. Uh, in this case, it's um
[01:28:58.720 --> 01:29:04.000]   Data that it reported to the california dmv someone sought that data and now
[01:29:04.000 --> 01:29:07.600]   Um, waymo is trying to redact it. It's you know, are these
[01:29:08.640 --> 01:29:16.320]   Do you feel like these companies have a legitimate trade secrets argument here or is it just a smoke screen because they're embarrassed
[01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:24.960]   I think it's I think it's a smokescreen. I don't you know when it comes to crashes. I think that you know, everything should be public
[01:29:24.960 --> 01:29:31.840]   Um, they're you know, especially with these types of systems because we don't we no one has
[01:29:33.280 --> 01:29:38.640]   Proven, you know that these systems are actually even as safe as human drivers yet
[01:29:38.640 --> 01:29:42.400]   You know and we cannot prove that until we have this data
[01:29:42.400 --> 01:29:47.840]   Um, you know at least you know, they are giving the data to government to to regulators
[01:29:47.840 --> 01:29:50.080]   So at least the regulators have access to the data
[01:29:50.080 --> 01:29:52.800]   But I think that you know, it should be public
[01:29:52.800 --> 01:29:55.920]   the I think we have a right to know because
[01:29:55.920 --> 01:30:00.240]   These companies are doing experiments on public roads around
[01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:04.320]   Other road users that have not consented to be part of an experiment
[01:30:04.320 --> 01:30:09.440]   I mean, did you sign off saying yeah, I'm okay with tesla testing self-full self-driving
[01:30:09.440 --> 01:30:12.400]   Around me or wemo or crews or anybody else
[01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:18.240]   I certainly didn't and so, you know, I think if they're going to test on public roads
[01:30:18.240 --> 01:30:21.040]   Around other users
[01:30:21.040 --> 01:30:25.360]   All of this information about how and when and why they crashed
[01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:29.440]   Um should be public. I think we have a right to know that information
[01:30:30.080 --> 01:30:34.960]   I mean, we don't necessarily have a right to know, you know, all the the source code and the specific, you know
[01:30:34.960 --> 01:30:38.160]   All the details of necessarily why it crashed or what went wrong
[01:30:38.160 --> 01:30:45.840]   But I think we should have a right to know what happened and and where well and that's what nitza's standing general order says right?
[01:30:45.840 --> 01:30:47.840]   You have to you must report
[01:30:47.840 --> 01:30:51.600]   Uh, and so now is everybody complying presumably they are
[01:30:51.600 --> 01:30:56.320]   To the best we can tell yeah, yeah, you know tesla submitted, you know
[01:30:56.480 --> 01:31:00.080]   Two reports on 273 crashes in the past 11 months
[01:31:00.080 --> 01:31:04.800]   Uh, so that's you know, that's a good start. I mean there are tens of thousands of crashes
[01:31:04.800 --> 01:31:10.240]   Uh, every month but it's about six this is about six and a half million crashes a year in the United States
[01:31:10.240 --> 01:31:11.520]   so
[01:31:11.520 --> 01:31:14.400]   And worldwide a million people die every year from auto
[01:31:14.400 --> 01:31:16.960]   Kress so
[01:31:16.960 --> 01:31:19.600]   It's I mean, I doesn't mean these are not
[01:31:19.600 --> 01:31:23.920]   Safe they may be much safer than a human driver
[01:31:25.120 --> 01:31:28.240]   Well, you know it depends you know it depends on
[01:31:28.240 --> 01:31:36.320]   You you have to do there's a lot of different driving scenarios a lot of different conditions and not all are
[01:31:36.320 --> 01:31:42.960]   Equally challenging some but what this doesn't report is others how many lives were saved by a desk
[01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:50.560]   That a human driver might have you know caused a collision. That's true. I mean it's we don't know the negative
[01:31:50.560 --> 01:31:54.560]   Yeah, yeah, it's hard to prove a negative. Yeah, you can't we can't know that I understand
[01:31:54.960 --> 01:31:59.760]   You know, but it may be the case that in fact that it's saving lives. We don't know it may be we yeah
[01:31:59.760 --> 01:32:01.760]   We don't we don't have any evidence to that
[01:32:01.760 --> 01:32:07.760]   To that effect and that that's the problem. Yeah, you know, we need we need more data to understand
[01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:15.440]   You know in the in the scenarios where these systems are being used are they actually safer because you know driving
[01:32:15.440 --> 01:32:19.920]   Driving in you know urban environments, you know relatively slow speeds
[01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:24.080]   You tend to have a lot of crashes, but they tend not to be fatal right most you know
[01:32:24.080 --> 01:32:28.480]   More than half of crashes aren't happening on rural roads. There's a lot of idiots
[01:32:28.480 --> 01:32:35.520]   Oh, yeah driving 78 miles an hour down a down the highway causing wrecks causing
[01:32:35.520 --> 01:32:38.080]   injuries and death
[01:32:38.080 --> 01:32:39.600]   humans
[01:32:39.600 --> 01:32:40.480]   so
[01:32:40.480 --> 01:32:41.280]   I
[01:32:41.280 --> 01:32:44.800]   I guess it's a drive over three trillion miles a year. I understand states
[01:32:44.800 --> 01:32:48.240]   I get I mean, but the we can't we don't know because we can't know
[01:32:48.880 --> 01:32:51.600]   If this is a if eight s is a
[01:32:51.600 --> 01:32:54.080]   Positive or a negative
[01:32:54.080 --> 01:33:00.960]   Right. We don't know that that this information doesn't so it's important to remember that well nitza uses information to regulate or
[01:33:00.960 --> 01:33:05.040]   What's the intent of this? That's that's the that's the long-term plan, you know
[01:33:05.040 --> 01:33:11.600]   Up to now they've never really collected data on the efficacy of these driver assist systems
[01:33:11.600 --> 01:33:16.800]   So this is the first time that they're really getting you know some hard data from the industry
[01:33:17.600 --> 01:33:24.960]   about how effective these systems actually are and you know, so they're going to be taking a close look at this data to try to understand
[01:33:24.960 --> 01:33:28.640]   You know, where do they work? Where do these systems not work?
[01:33:28.640 --> 01:33:37.280]   And you know what if anything needs to be regulated how or or you know, how do how do we create standards for the performance of these systems?
[01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:39.280]   we're somewhat immune
[01:33:39.280 --> 01:33:45.920]   Because because this happens all the time to the number of auto deaths crashes and incidents that happen all the time
[01:33:46.640 --> 01:33:56.000]   constantly uh and and and so it's it's an easy thing to be fooled for instance when you talk about uh electric vehicle fires
[01:33:56.000 --> 01:33:59.120]   It scares people until they
[01:33:59.120 --> 01:34:03.200]   Remember that there are gas vehicle fires all the time
[01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:07.200]   It's not 200,000 a year 200,000 a year so
[01:34:07.200 --> 01:34:15.280]   Uh, it's really important to remember. Yeah 273 Tesla accidents, but put it in context
[01:34:16.560 --> 01:34:21.760]   And this is the problem is that we don't we just really don't know if eight s is a net positive or a negative
[01:34:21.760 --> 01:34:27.680]   And we can't know that we don't know how many accidents were avoided by eight s my experience as a driver is
[01:34:27.680 --> 01:34:30.960]   And but either way I pay attention because I don't trust the damn thing
[01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:37.120]   But but but my which is the right I think the right way to use it. No, that's the right way to use it
[01:34:37.120 --> 01:34:38.720]   But it is a help
[01:34:38.720 --> 01:34:42.640]   And there have been many times and I bet you everybody watching has had an experience
[01:34:42.640 --> 01:34:45.280]   Uh, if you have one of these cars that stops
[01:34:45.920 --> 01:34:49.440]   before you hit a car in front of you or a pedestrian
[01:34:49.440 --> 01:34:54.720]   My daughter, how often are you accidentally almost hitting pedestrian? Well?
[01:34:54.720 --> 01:35:00.480]   Uh, not a lot, but it happens, right? Have you ever well do you drive Paris? First of all, do you drive? I think you bicycle
[01:35:00.480 --> 01:35:05.680]   So you don't yeah, I was gonna say I think quiet during this as the brooklyn or who has a e-bike
[01:35:05.680 --> 01:35:12.240]   And believe me, let's if there weren't so many cars everywhere times have you almost been hit by a car
[01:35:12.240 --> 01:35:14.240]   Yeah, there you go all the time all the time
[01:35:14.640 --> 01:35:21.520]   Yeah, uh, and I I think that these new technologies where cars stop before they you know, I'll tell you what
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:25.760]   My car has stopped me two or three times from backing into traffic
[01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:30.400]   It has a big beeper. This is just cross traffic and I go whoa, I didn't see that one
[01:35:30.400 --> 01:35:32.160]   So
[01:35:32.160 --> 01:35:37.760]   I think you can probably make a strong case that these things used properly are a net plus
[01:35:37.760 --> 01:35:43.520]   And and I think you know things like blind spot monitoring and cross traffic alert are huge
[01:35:43.680 --> 01:35:49.280]   You know, they are truly valuable and they are truly beneficial and they're relatively low cost
[01:35:49.280 --> 01:35:55.760]   But you know some of the other stuff especially if you treat it as if it's self-driving. Yeah, that's the key
[01:35:55.760 --> 01:35:57.840]   That's why auto pilots are bad choice
[01:35:57.840 --> 01:36:01.520]   We had there is a curve we I drive down on the way to san francisco
[01:36:01.520 --> 01:36:06.800]   That my tessel would invariably try to pull me into the wall because it just got confused
[01:36:06.800 --> 01:36:11.040]   But I know that and I had my hands on the wheel and when it started to veer out of the lane
[01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:13.040]   I would pull it back into the lane and be fine
[01:36:13.680 --> 01:36:20.080]   Um, but but look at the case of walter wong the the apple engineer has tragically died in 2018
[01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:27.120]   Yeah, yeah, he drove his tessel every day. He had multiple instances of same problem on auto pilot
[01:36:27.120 --> 01:36:32.640]   Trying to pull him into that same spot on that medium that interchange. Yeah where he ultimately died
[01:36:32.640 --> 01:36:35.120]   Yeah, and he reported it to tessel and you know
[01:36:35.120 --> 01:36:41.200]   And yet he continued to use the system that's the problem in a way. You know, and that's yeah
[01:36:41.440 --> 01:36:43.440]   the the you know
[01:36:43.440 --> 01:36:49.200]   Again it comes back to the human behavior because of the the expectation the fault the the erroneous expectation
[01:36:49.200 --> 01:36:53.440]   We have about the capabilities of these systems. I have not I'm just happy to say
[01:36:53.440 --> 01:36:58.720]   But the cause of any accidents in my life. I've been in a few but it's always rear-ended or some, you know
[01:36:58.720 --> 01:37:00.720]   Somebody ran it ran into me
[01:37:00.720 --> 01:37:05.120]   Uh, but I do use those especially on highway stop and go traffic
[01:37:05.120 --> 01:37:09.760]   Uh, I've used the tessel a lane change mechanism. I don't I never had a full self-driving
[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:14.640]   Tesla, but I felt like those made me better drivers because uh, it just
[01:37:14.640 --> 01:37:22.080]   You know and and and by the way one of the best features of automatic cruise control is it
[01:37:22.080 --> 01:37:26.240]   It actually keeps more of more car lengths between you and the car in front of you
[01:37:26.240 --> 01:37:29.360]   It keeps the proper amount humans never do right?
[01:37:29.360 --> 01:37:36.880]   Humans are always tailgating because we don't we're not we can't adjust to the idea that you're not going to be able to stop in 60 feet
[01:37:36.880 --> 01:37:39.360]   You know, you're going too fast
[01:37:39.680 --> 01:37:45.040]   Uh, but the car knows it and so I let the car determine the the distance from the car ahead of me
[01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:52.320]   And of course trying to remember drivers ed aren't you know, isn't like six seconds to two second rule two second rule?
[01:37:52.320 --> 01:37:57.200]   Yeah, but I mean how you know that that distance that distance depends on new speed
[01:37:57.200 --> 01:37:58.160]   You know, what speed you're going?
[01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:00.160]   You know that the car does it perfectly
[01:38:00.160 --> 01:38:03.520]   More grounded two seconds at 70 miles an hour than a 20 the car
[01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:08.560]   I'm presuming does it perfectly and uh, so I trust it and it's a lot farther than I would do otherwise
[01:38:08.560 --> 01:38:11.920]   It's not using radar if it's only using cameras, which is what tesla does now
[01:38:11.920 --> 01:38:13.920]   They they stopped using radar
[01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:19.440]   Then you know, then it it's actually does actually doesn't do a very good job of
[01:38:19.440 --> 01:38:22.160]   And can't do a very good job of distance measurement
[01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:29.920]   Which is also why they have a problem with phantom braking randomly slamming on the brakes when there's nothing there that happened to
[01:38:29.920 --> 01:38:31.920]   Lisa hated that
[01:38:31.920 --> 01:38:33.920]   That happened to her all the time in her tesla
[01:38:34.720 --> 01:38:39.280]   Uh in our tesla and uh, she actually was one who said you can never buy another tesla
[01:38:39.280 --> 01:38:43.440]   Because of a number of automated systems that failed her
[01:38:43.440 --> 01:38:50.240]   I like in the in the chat chumlee says if you leave the gap a blue bmw will fill it
[01:38:50.240 --> 01:38:56.240]   Well, that by the way is exactly right because I leave the exact you know, it's sometimes it's five or six lengths
[01:38:56.240 --> 01:39:01.280]   And inevitably somebody says oh, that's nice. Thank you for letting me in and now I have to slow down
[01:39:01.680 --> 01:39:04.800]   Your your your maki, you know, one of the features using radar
[01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:06.800]   It actually has it has five radar sensors
[01:39:06.800 --> 01:39:10.080]   It's got a long range radar on the front and four medium range corner radars
[01:39:10.080 --> 01:39:17.440]   That uses to detect cut-ins. So if a blue bmw or anybody else that goes in there, you know, it will
[01:39:17.440 --> 01:39:24.480]   Open up that gap and let them in I I feel much safer in my maki, but it doesn't attempt to do as much
[01:39:24.480 --> 01:39:28.240]   I don't know who crews yet. It doesn't attempt to do as much so
[01:39:29.040 --> 01:39:34.160]   The irony is that those people who are weaving in and out and switching lanes. I remember a study
[01:39:34.160 --> 01:39:37.840]   I read once that like they don't gain any advantage course not
[01:39:37.840 --> 01:39:44.960]   Like getting getting where they're going any faster. So yeah, maybe we should let the come, you know, let the robots just drive us and
[01:39:44.960 --> 01:39:47.840]   You know, I'm gonna get shot all these days
[01:39:47.840 --> 01:39:53.280]   Because when somebody does that they weave in and out of traffic and they go buy me and then they're at the stoplight
[01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:55.360]   And I catch up with them. I always wave at them
[01:39:57.680 --> 01:40:01.760]   I know that somebody's gonna you don't want to do that. No road rage is real
[01:40:01.760 --> 01:40:10.640]   Do you have a driver's license paris or you just completely can't or just oh I have a driver's license
[01:40:10.640 --> 01:40:12.480]   Yeah, so you could if you wanted to I know here
[01:40:12.480 --> 01:40:19.280]   I could if I want to I have no interest in New York City because you don't eat but you also don't need to there's good mass transit
[01:40:19.280 --> 01:40:27.280]   Uh, there's I mean you don't need to I would ride my bike everywhere if I didn't worry about people with eight-ass hitting me
[01:40:28.080 --> 01:40:30.240]   I mean, I'm the one thing I'm
[01:40:30.240 --> 01:40:32.320]   Because there's so many Teslas in your area, right?
[01:40:32.320 --> 01:40:35.120]   Go ahead. I'm really excited to see what this
[01:40:35.120 --> 01:40:39.760]   Technology does to the trucking industry over the next five. That's where we're gonna see it
[01:40:39.760 --> 01:40:46.800]   Yeah, that is the area where we're going to see leaps and bounds because I mean that is one area. We're talking about fatality rates
[01:40:46.800 --> 01:40:49.600]   Trucking is a dangerous
[01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:54.880]   Endeavor. I mean for the people around the truck for truck drivers. They often have fallen asleep
[01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:56.880]   They're paid very low wages
[01:40:56.880 --> 01:41:00.320]   Having a robust not quite autopilot
[01:41:00.320 --> 01:41:03.280]   I think that's still even going to be a ways off in five ten years
[01:41:03.280 --> 01:41:06.800]   But having a robust driving assistant like program
[01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:13.360]   Would make such a noticeable difference in trucking fatalities wall street journal article this week
[01:41:13.360 --> 01:41:18.160]   Christopher Mims self-driving big rigs are coming is america ready
[01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:21.040]   But do these have safety drivers or are they come?
[01:41:21.040 --> 01:41:26.160]   Like there's no human involved today. They are still running with safety drivers, but
[01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:34.000]   By the end of 2023 or first half of 2024 there are several companies that are expecting to
[01:41:34.000 --> 01:41:39.840]   Start driver out operations at least in certain regions like around Texas
[01:41:39.840 --> 01:41:44.240]   You know around the southwest where the the weather's good the roads are relatively flat
[01:41:44.240 --> 01:41:47.920]   You've got good visibility. So there's an AI
[01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:51.520]   Driving the truck the whole way
[01:41:51.520 --> 01:41:57.120]   It's it's a combination of AI and deterministic software
[01:41:57.120 --> 01:41:59.680]   Is there somebody back at the home office?
[01:41:59.680 --> 01:42:03.360]   AI by it's on is there somebody at the home office who can take over or anything?
[01:42:03.360 --> 01:42:08.960]   Yeah, they all all of these systems whether it's on a light-duty vehicle or a big rig have
[01:42:08.960 --> 01:42:13.840]   Tell it some sort of tele operation or remote operation capability
[01:42:14.320 --> 01:42:18.560]   So that you know if the truck gets into a situation that it doesn't know how to handle
[01:42:18.560 --> 01:42:23.680]   It can basically call call back to base and say hey, I need you to take control
[01:42:23.680 --> 01:42:27.360]   And so remote operator. Oh, cool in most cases
[01:42:27.360 --> 01:42:31.520]   It'll be you know looking at the sensor data and giving it some hints
[01:42:31.520 --> 01:42:38.240]   You know and this is designed for things like construction zones or you know other things like that where it's not quite sure what it should be doing
[01:42:39.520 --> 01:42:44.000]   Um, and what happens when it gets to the off-ramp? Does it driver take over or is the?
[01:42:44.000 --> 01:42:48.880]   No, well, I mean, you know if there's no driver in the vehicle there's nobody to take over
[01:42:48.880 --> 01:42:54.080]   So these systems most right now most of they're being designed to go hub to hub
[01:42:54.080 --> 01:42:59.520]   You know where the the depot is located close relatively close to the off-ramp
[01:42:59.520 --> 01:43:02.640]   So within a half mile to a mile the off-ramp
[01:43:02.640 --> 01:43:07.600]   So it'll take the off-ramp pull into a depot and then you know, maybe there
[01:43:08.160 --> 01:43:12.800]   A driver will will jump depending on what it is. They may transfer freight to another vehicle
[01:43:12.800 --> 01:43:16.160]   Or to smaller vehicles for last mile delivery
[01:43:16.160 --> 01:43:22.320]   Or you know a human driver may take over to to do the the final leg of the trip
[01:43:22.320 --> 01:43:25.280]   Wow, and I presume that these
[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:28.000]   AIs will be
[01:43:28.000 --> 01:43:33.280]   Less aggressive than human drivers that they'll oh yeah, they'll be willing to know mad max modes
[01:43:33.280 --> 01:43:37.040]   Yeah, and they're gonna follow the speed limit and they're gonna stay in the right
[01:43:37.760 --> 01:43:40.560]   You know the worst thing is when you see a big rig passing
[01:43:40.560 --> 01:43:45.680]   other big rigs or other cars even because he wants to go the speed limit
[01:43:45.680 --> 01:43:48.000]   terrifies me
[01:43:48.000 --> 01:43:50.000]   I mean and it's kind of a
[01:43:50.000 --> 01:43:55.520]   Part of the issue is I guess based on the fact that you have human drivers that of course have to sleep
[01:43:55.520 --> 01:43:57.440]   and
[01:43:57.440 --> 01:44:04.880]   Oftentimes are being paid, you know by the mile or being paid based on whether or not they can get there in a certain amount of time
[01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:08.400]   So you have all these things baked into the system that often lead to
[01:44:08.400 --> 01:44:12.880]   folks being forced to drive on little sleep and speed and
[01:44:12.880 --> 01:44:17.440]   Pass cars on the left-hand side when they shouldn't be if you have just a
[01:44:17.440 --> 01:44:22.000]   Autonomous vehicle taking these sort of trips. It should be all baked in
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:27.440]   There shouldn't be any unnecessary speeding because it is leaving from point A to point A with no stops
[01:44:27.440 --> 01:44:29.920]   And I want it to be passive
[01:44:29.920 --> 01:44:31.920]   I don't want it to be aggressive
[01:44:32.640 --> 01:44:37.280]   I wanted to just say okay with dinner video video. We'll get there eventually
[01:44:37.280 --> 01:44:40.000]   Which is by the way how I drive
[01:44:40.000 --> 01:44:44.000]   You know if it's driving at the truck speed limit
[01:44:44.000 --> 01:44:48.800]   Um, you know, it's not you know the the the autonomous system is not going to get tired
[01:44:48.800 --> 01:44:53.520]   It's not going to get distracted. Yeah, you know human driver human truck drivers are they're limited to
[01:44:53.520 --> 01:45:00.880]   10 hours a day of driving right and you know then they have to have a certain there's a mandated brake period before they can drive again
[01:45:01.280 --> 01:45:04.560]   And they use electronic data loggers now for that
[01:45:04.560 --> 01:45:07.280]   So, you know automating
[01:45:07.280 --> 01:45:10.960]   That long haul part, you know, and you know, it's real
[01:45:10.960 --> 01:45:15.840]   There's a shortage of truck drivers, which is part of the supply chain problem we have and there has been a shortage
[01:45:15.840 --> 01:45:19.360]   I mean, there's been a shortage since like the 70s or 80s. It's been an issue
[01:45:19.360 --> 01:45:23.520]   They've been regulated the industry because it's a big job. It's hard to recruit drivers
[01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:27.280]   You know, they don't want to know people don't want to do this job or most people don't want to do this
[01:45:27.360 --> 01:45:32.880]   Claim that commie or at least for the amount that they're being paid because it's like pennies often
[01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:36.320]   It's jimmy carters fault and I blame him for deregulaty
[01:45:36.320 --> 01:45:37.520]   I always blame
[01:45:37.520 --> 01:45:39.520]   Jimmy
[01:45:39.520 --> 01:45:46.000]   Somebody that chat room says it being a trucker is a terrible job. She's that commie carter deregulated the industry
[01:45:46.000 --> 01:45:50.000]   That's that
[01:45:50.000 --> 01:45:52.000]   Yeah, same one
[01:45:52.000 --> 01:45:56.320]   I should not mock 67 year olds
[01:45:57.200 --> 01:45:59.520]   Okay, go ahead. I'm sorry. Go ahead. Oh, I was
[01:45:59.520 --> 01:46:05.280]   What if they took these trucks and like linked them together and like what if they put them on a dedicated?
[01:46:05.280 --> 01:46:08.000]   That's calling the train
[01:46:08.000 --> 01:46:10.160]   Yeah, it's called a train
[01:46:10.160 --> 01:46:12.160]   I'm just waiting for some
[01:46:12.160 --> 01:46:17.760]   That's a ridiculous idea. You know what you need to do is dig a hole in the ground and put them in there
[01:46:17.760 --> 01:46:20.480]   There you go tunnel tunnel the way
[01:46:20.480 --> 01:46:24.080]   uh, let's take a little break. I do want to talk about ai because
[01:46:25.120 --> 01:46:30.160]   Of course lamb does been in the news and we've talked about that already on the show, but I just I feel like
[01:46:30.160 --> 01:46:35.680]   It's going to sneak up us on us. That's what really we're talking about. It's sneaking up on us bit by bit
[01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:41.200]   So let's take a little break. We'll do that in just a second. I want to talk a little bit about userway.org
[01:46:41.200 --> 01:46:44.080]   very proud
[01:46:44.080 --> 01:46:50.640]   To have a userway on our website at twit.tv because after all not only do you have a legal obligation
[01:46:51.120 --> 01:46:57.840]   To users with disabilities you have a moral obligation and a business reason to make your site accessible watch
[01:46:57.840 --> 01:47:00.480]   userway.org
[01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:05.520]   I'm talking about making your website ada compliant accessible
[01:47:05.520 --> 01:47:12.640]   Not only is it the right thing to do because you're opening up your website to a much larger group 60 million plus people
[01:47:12.640 --> 01:47:17.360]   You have a responsibility to make your site accessible. It's a public entity
[01:47:17.360 --> 01:47:20.800]   So you got to make it accessible and with userway, it's easy
[01:47:20.800 --> 01:47:24.560]   That was my biggest concern was oh, I can't afford it or it's gonna be too hard
[01:47:24.560 --> 01:47:29.920]   No userway is really affordable and it's really easy and incredible. It's ai powered
[01:47:29.920 --> 01:47:34.960]   Tirelessly enforces all the accessibility guidelines the wca g
[01:47:34.960 --> 01:47:39.920]   Wukak guidelines and I love this so do our engineers. It's one line of javascript
[01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:46.480]   That's it because userway is so good. It's used by more than a million websites including the big guys coca-cola
[01:47:46.800 --> 01:47:53.440]   Disney ebay these are companies that really have to be accessible and userway can do that as you get bigger
[01:47:53.440 --> 01:47:56.400]   They scale with you if they can handle Disney
[01:47:56.400 --> 01:48:02.960]   Absolutely, they can handle you they make best-in-class enterprise level accessibility tools available to you
[01:48:02.960 --> 01:48:08.160]   Your small or medium-sized business and then as you scale you need userway and you're ready
[01:48:08.160 --> 01:48:13.120]   It just makes business sense some of the biggest problems nav menus very difficult
[01:48:13.360 --> 01:48:17.120]   So the way this works if you're blind or you're using accessibility tools
[01:48:17.120 --> 01:48:21.840]   There is what they call an accessibility layer. That's what the screen reader sees
[01:48:21.840 --> 01:48:28.320]   So really what userway does is make sure that all the information available to the front page to the sighted user
[01:48:28.320 --> 01:48:31.520]   Is available to the browser in the accessibility layer?
[01:48:31.520 --> 01:48:36.640]   It changes colors now you've got your pan tone color for your business. Of course we do too
[01:48:36.640 --> 01:48:42.480]   Doesn't change that but it adjusts you in luminance. So it's easier for people with vision issues to read
[01:48:43.040 --> 01:48:44.800]   So userway will generate all tags
[01:48:44.800 --> 01:48:49.520]   That's one of the reasons in aids AI it can actually see the picture and generate an all tag that matches the picture
[01:48:49.520 --> 01:48:53.280]   Automatically you can go in if you want you can modify it of course
[01:48:53.280 --> 01:48:57.520]   It fixes violations like vague links fixes broken links
[01:48:57.520 --> 01:49:00.880]   Make sure that your website uses accessible colors
[01:49:00.880 --> 01:49:05.120]   And you'll get a detailed report of all the violations that were fixed on your website
[01:49:05.120 --> 01:49:08.160]   So, you know exactly what it did plus you can work with it
[01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:12.720]   Userway integrates seamlessly with your site builder software
[01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:16.000]   Let userway help your business meet its compliance goals

[01:50:18.480 --> 01:50:23.040]   Consistently the best $400 a year. I spent subscribing
[01:50:23.040 --> 01:50:26.480]   Lovely. I love the information you guys do such a good job
[01:50:26.480 --> 01:50:30.080]   Do you have will you ever get to do the saturday piece because I love that
[01:50:30.960 --> 01:50:35.040]   I've been meaning to it just requires me taking a minute away from the news
[01:50:35.040 --> 01:50:41.440]   We've started doing kind of a weekend section at the information which kind of magazine. Yeah, it's fantastic. Yeah
[01:50:41.440 --> 01:50:45.440]   Uh this week san francisco's back sort of
[01:50:45.440 --> 01:50:48.160]   I chose to be intentionally paranoid
[01:50:48.160 --> 01:50:50.880]   Adam soplensky soplisky
[01:50:50.880 --> 01:50:56.400]   Navigates aws to a cloudy future. So your startup died. This is my one of my favorite stories. We're corry
[01:50:56.400 --> 01:50:59.600]   Send it to kristina. Oh that swag. Yeah, what do you do with all that swag?
[01:51:00.400 --> 01:51:05.360]   Uh, yes, that's a kristina warren of course inside the crypto stunt factory
[01:51:05.360 --> 01:51:12.560]   ABCs of summer. Good job. I love the information. Yeah, I want to see you some of your stuff in there. You're busy. I guess you got
[01:51:12.560 --> 01:51:19.120]   You know, I love the cake clerk. She just did this piece on kind of uh san francisco being back going
[01:51:19.120 --> 01:51:25.280]   Is it start up land? Is it back? Maybe I mean, I don't know. I don't live there if you ask me probably dead, but
[01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:32.000]   It's one of the most beautiful cities. Uh, I love san francisco. I lived there for a decade
[01:51:32.000 --> 01:51:34.640]   Loved living there, but that was a
[01:51:34.640 --> 01:51:36.880]   long time ago
[01:51:36.880 --> 01:51:44.480]   30 30 years ago, uh bring it back to our I think pre opening chat san francisco features heavily in horizon forbidden west
[01:51:44.480 --> 01:51:49.520]   Oh, everyone should play except for it's post post-apocalyptic san francisco. Yeah
[01:51:49.520 --> 01:51:52.640]   I love san francisco and
[01:51:52.640 --> 01:51:58.000]   And there's things that makes san francisco fantastic. It's seven square miles. So it can't go beyond those borders
[01:51:58.000 --> 01:52:02.800]   Um, it's got beautiful views. It's got the bay. It's got the whole gate bridge
[01:52:02.800 --> 01:52:06.720]   It's got great neighborhoods. Um, it's of late
[01:52:06.720 --> 01:52:09.920]   Been a little challenging to live there
[01:52:09.920 --> 01:52:14.880]   Uh, I just I and I think some of that is because of income inequality
[01:52:14.880 --> 01:52:20.240]   There's all these fabulously wealthy tech startup folks and then there's a lot of fun
[01:52:20.240 --> 01:52:23.920]   I think it has to do with what you just said. It's seven square miles
[01:52:23.920 --> 01:52:28.560]   You've got very specific housing laws that are going to restrict the amount of kind of
[01:52:28.560 --> 01:52:31.680]   dense uh residential structures
[01:52:31.680 --> 01:52:38.160]   So of course housing is very expensive because of that and a number of other reasons and it's kind of like brooklyn
[01:52:38.160 --> 01:52:42.800]   Kind of like brooklyn. Yeah. Yeah. I mean your turn. I mean, you know
[01:52:42.800 --> 01:52:48.480]   Don't cast too much shade because brooklyn's gonna have the same problem. I I think oh, yeah brooklyn. I mean
[01:52:48.720 --> 01:52:51.440]   It's getting totally I think there was a recent
[01:52:51.440 --> 01:52:57.680]   Report that the average apartment rent in manhattan is four thousand dollars a month
[01:52:57.680 --> 01:53:00.480]   For a one bedroom and that one out of four
[01:53:00.480 --> 01:53:06.880]   New rentals has a bidding war going on for the monthly rent. Wow, and I know anecdotally people who
[01:53:06.880 --> 01:53:13.200]   Say they had their apartment the rent raised by a thousand dollars. They went to go look for a new place
[01:53:13.760 --> 01:53:16.800]   They put they were like put down their application for an apartment
[01:53:16.800 --> 01:53:21.760]   They're like, oh, sorry someone took it because they're willing to pay a thousand dollars more than the listed price
[01:53:21.760 --> 01:53:25.680]   That's four thousand. That's almost three times my mortgage payment
[01:53:25.680 --> 01:53:29.520]   It's actually very close to what we pay here in the bay or everywhere in the bay
[01:53:29.520 --> 01:53:35.840]   It's so expensive living love to just throw my money away every month. Oh when thomas loves the city, right?
[01:53:35.840 --> 01:53:37.920]   Oh when thomas senior editor protocol
[01:53:37.920 --> 01:53:40.640]   leo, I was practically late to
[01:53:41.760 --> 01:53:48.400]   Late to the podcast because um there were so many people on columbus avenue. There was a street fair
[01:53:48.400 --> 01:53:55.600]   I love north beach north beaches. I used to live on green and montgomery. I love north beach. I mean
[01:53:55.600 --> 01:54:00.480]   You would you would not have believed it and it was beautiful. I bet it was
[01:54:00.480 --> 01:54:04.880]   Yeah, beautiful sunny day. Yeah streets were absolutely packed for this fair
[01:54:04.880 --> 01:54:11.360]   Um now the thing is though you get past the transamerica pyramid and I mean it's a sunday so right
[01:54:11.840 --> 01:54:14.320]   There wouldn't be a lot of people downtown normally
[01:54:14.320 --> 01:54:20.240]   Um, but yeah, I mean the interesting thing is where we where we are in the financial district
[01:54:20.240 --> 01:54:23.280]   It is really busy actually on a on a weekday
[01:54:23.280 --> 01:54:27.280]   But when you cross market street down, you know and get into soma
[01:54:27.280 --> 01:54:32.640]   It's it does get a little dead like around. Yeah, yeah around salesforce tower
[01:54:32.640 --> 01:54:33.840]   there
[01:54:33.840 --> 01:54:36.800]   a lot of you know the big tech companies who became the
[01:54:36.800 --> 01:54:41.200]   You know primary tenants of these office towers in in the past decade
[01:54:42.160 --> 01:54:48.640]   They're all on you know permanent remote or like hybrid very light on the office plans and
[01:54:48.640 --> 01:54:52.400]   And maybe somebody wants to be there when the millennium tower falls over all
[01:54:52.400 --> 01:54:58.480]   Exactly. Oh my gosh. There's another tower that has like a flood. I don't know how
[01:54:58.480 --> 01:55:01.840]   The morning tower we should explain is sinking
[01:55:01.840 --> 01:55:07.920]   because much of san francis goes built on landfills from the gold rush days and uh,
[01:55:07.920 --> 01:55:10.320]   They're trying to shore it up
[01:55:11.120 --> 01:55:13.680]   By digging underneath and putting sticks in there
[01:55:13.680 --> 01:55:15.040]   Effect, they didn't
[01:55:15.040 --> 01:55:22.080]   The millennium tower is sinking into the landfills underneath san francisco. Just really says a lot sinking and tilting
[01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:28.000]   Yeah, well part of it's that's why it's tilting because one part sinking faster than the other part
[01:55:28.000 --> 01:55:31.520]   It's the new leaning tower of pisa
[01:55:31.520 --> 01:55:38.320]   Uh, it's very horizon forbidden west. Yeah, I can't wait to play this game now that I know it san francisco figures large
[01:55:39.040 --> 01:55:44.880]   Uh, that's hysterical anyway a little bit to get there, but okay. Well, that gives me something to shoot for
[01:55:44.880 --> 01:55:51.920]   That's the first one or the second one. That's the second one. Okay, the new one. Okay. Yeah, but there are a lot of other cities like there's uh
[01:55:51.920 --> 01:55:55.120]   post-apocalyptic new like las vegas
[01:55:55.120 --> 01:55:56.880]   Oh, man
[01:55:56.880 --> 01:56:01.680]   Las vegas featured heavily in fallout and that was a lot of fun. Yeah wonder through the post-apocalypse
[01:56:01.680 --> 01:56:04.320]   Las vegas. Yeah, yeah, yeah
[01:56:04.320 --> 01:56:07.440]   Uh great to have you all in senior editor protocol
[01:56:07.440 --> 01:56:11.440]   Which has been come my one of my uh, every day must reads
[01:56:11.440 --> 01:56:15.680]   Really a great journal and it's free. Uh, no no paywall
[01:56:15.680 --> 01:56:21.440]   Which i'm very grateful for I do some stuff sign up for our newsletters. That's uh, yep
[01:56:21.440 --> 01:56:23.760]   We'll be asking right now. Yep, that's great
[01:56:23.760 --> 01:56:29.680]   Uh, and also samable salmon my car guy principal researcher at guide house instights
[01:56:29.680 --> 01:56:35.440]   He with uh robbie and nicole does that great wheel bearings podcast if you love autumn obeals
[01:56:36.640 --> 01:56:38.640]   You must get wheel bearings
[01:56:38.640 --> 01:56:45.680]   Uh speaking of wheels you were talking about carbon fiber wheels. Is that the next uh the next big thing?
[01:56:45.680 --> 01:56:51.920]   Yeah, there's been a few cars that have been built with carbon fiber wheels. Um, you can get them right now
[01:56:51.920 --> 01:56:56.400]   Or just the wheels not the wheel itself. Okay, so it's still rubber tires
[01:56:56.400 --> 01:57:01.440]   But the wheel itself instead of being made out of aluminum or steel is made out of carbon fiber
[01:57:01.440 --> 01:57:05.600]   What's the benefit of that? It's lighter? Uh, it's a lot lighter. It's stronger
[01:57:06.080 --> 01:57:09.040]   Um, it's actually more resistant to damage
[01:57:09.040 --> 01:57:13.120]   Um, and you know for for ev's because efficiency is so important
[01:57:13.120 --> 01:57:19.520]   The rotational inertia is even more important than just you know moving who would have thought of that
[01:57:19.520 --> 01:57:23.120]   That's interesting. So I think when I was talking to the ceo
[01:57:23.120 --> 01:57:30.240]   A couple of weeks ago. He told me, um, you know, they're they're working on they're they're gonna have they're gonna have their wheels on a new
[01:57:31.040 --> 01:57:37.840]   B coming out later this year. Um saves about 60 kilograms, which is about 130 140 pounds
[01:57:37.840 --> 01:57:40.880]   Yeah, especially at the wheels
[01:57:40.880 --> 01:57:45.120]   Uh, you know is in you know, as we get these bigger and bigger wheels on cars
[01:57:45.120 --> 01:57:50.880]   You know that those 22 and 24 inch wheels you ever pick one of those things up they get pretty heavy
[01:57:50.880 --> 01:57:56.640]   And so um, you know carbon fiber is an important material for that kind of that sort of thing
[01:57:56.640 --> 01:57:58.960]   You know what else is lighter?
[01:57:59.360 --> 01:58:02.800]   You're stipple. I've been stippled paris
[01:58:02.800 --> 01:58:05.520]   You did this in your spare time
[01:58:05.520 --> 01:58:10.080]   I did this during the ad read. What do you have a woodcut machine? How did you do that?
[01:58:10.080 --> 01:58:14.240]   I do. I've just you know got a little man with a wood chopper in the background of my apartment
[01:58:14.240 --> 01:58:18.160]   No, the wall street journal apparently has something on your member page
[01:58:18.160 --> 01:58:22.720]   If you have an account where you can they have like a ai
[01:58:22.720 --> 01:58:28.000]   That will stipple you so I uploaded a photo from you of you on the internet
[01:58:28.240 --> 01:58:32.400]   Uh to the stipple ai so that's an official w sj stipple
[01:58:32.400 --> 01:58:37.760]   I believe they call it a head cut technically if there's any head cut wsj heads out there
[01:58:37.760 --> 01:58:39.760]   Is that on your member benefits?
[01:58:39.760 --> 01:58:42.560]   I think so genuinely
[01:58:42.560 --> 01:58:45.120]   It's called ai portrait
[01:58:45.120 --> 01:58:47.920]   Only create your portrait
[01:58:47.920 --> 01:58:51.040]   That's awesome. All right. Well, I subscribe so uh
[01:58:51.040 --> 01:58:54.160]   Thank you ruport
[01:58:54.400 --> 01:58:59.440]   And thank you for the Murdochs are working on yeah, you know stipples for everyone's money. Yeah
[01:58:59.440 --> 01:59:01.440]   those are my democracy and
[01:59:01.440 --> 01:59:03.120]   that's us
[01:59:03.120 --> 01:59:05.120]   Yeah
[01:59:05.120 --> 01:59:07.040]   Wow, so
[01:59:07.040 --> 01:59:11.360]   We've already talked on the twit last week and on twig we spent a lot of time talking about
[01:59:11.360 --> 01:59:15.280]   lambda and uh the uh, you know
[01:59:15.280 --> 01:59:21.280]   Determination by one google employee former now. I think google employee
[01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:29.120]   That lambda had become sentient and uh, then google saying it's not sentient and it's obvious that anybody who's ever you know
[01:59:29.120 --> 01:59:31.200]   Played with this stuff that it is in fact
[01:59:31.200 --> 01:59:34.080]   Sentient, but it's pretty impressive
[01:59:34.080 --> 01:59:41.360]   But I it also makes me start to think and i've seen some articles along this line that ai is slowly creeping up on us
[01:59:41.360 --> 01:59:45.600]   Do you think that?
[01:59:45.600 --> 01:59:49.120]   Let me ask i'll start with you. Oh, and do you think that?
[01:59:50.000 --> 01:59:54.880]   In the next few years more and more things besides self-driving vehicles are going to be
[01:59:54.880 --> 01:59:59.520]   Powered by I mean real ai not general intelligence
[01:59:59.520 --> 02:00:05.840]   But and not sentient intelligence, but ai that's doing stuff that we would normally think of as humans
[02:00:05.840 --> 02:00:13.680]   I mean, I think like 90 percent of customer service is headed. It already probably already is frankly like you're yeah
[02:00:13.680 --> 02:00:17.520]   You know you're you're chatting with someone or something
[02:00:18.160 --> 02:00:21.520]   um, that seems like a kind of obvious application
[02:00:21.520 --> 02:00:28.880]   Um, you know rather than making people like search for something on your website. You just chat them through what you know essentially
[02:00:28.880 --> 02:00:35.440]   Is this gonna be one of those technologies like atms kind of crept up on us when's the last time you went into a bank
[02:00:35.440 --> 02:00:40.560]   Right used and your you guys are too young to remember maybe sam you remember
[02:00:40.560 --> 02:00:46.560]   If you wanted money the way you went to get the way you got money that you would go into a bank use book
[02:00:46.640 --> 02:00:52.320]   Yeah, you would either give me your passport or write a check and they would a human would count out money
[02:00:52.320 --> 02:00:56.880]   Now nobody does it anymore. We're just like atms have just kind of gradually
[02:00:56.880 --> 02:01:01.360]   I remember using my first atm at bank of america in the 80s
[02:01:01.360 --> 02:01:06.880]   And it was really primitive. It was like 40 characters by eight lines from mechanical turk
[02:01:06.880 --> 02:01:10.720]   Yeah, they're like a little man inside really really primitive
[02:01:10.720 --> 02:01:15.360]   Uh, but you could get money and that was like at the time you went wow. This is pretty cool
[02:01:15.920 --> 02:01:19.920]   Now it's second, you know, I don't think peris you probably ever went into a
[02:01:19.920 --> 02:01:24.800]   But I went into a bank often I would have to get in checks. Okay. I would have to
[02:01:24.800 --> 02:01:28.240]   Because I'm gonna go in there to set up your account do right checks
[02:01:28.240 --> 02:01:35.040]   I do because when I foya, uh police departments a lot of municipal like
[02:01:35.040 --> 02:01:40.720]   Local governments do not take online payment plus your kind of retro for that. You have your
[02:01:41.440 --> 02:01:44.660]   You know, I have my speakers of the
[02:01:44.660 --> 02:01:51.040]   Yeah, checks are back in guys. Oh, yeah, all the hipsters in dumbo are right in checks now. I mean
[02:01:51.040 --> 02:01:54.800]   I'll do you one better
[02:01:54.800 --> 02:02:01.840]   How many people are not going to atms because they don't use cash who uses cash? That's right. That's the next thing
[02:02:01.840 --> 02:02:05.760]   They're tapping just my phone. Why do you need cash? I don't yeah
[02:02:05.760 --> 02:02:08.880]   I don't you know what the only time the reason I get cash
[02:02:08.880 --> 02:02:11.680]   I do go to the atm once a week because I like to tip
[02:02:11.680 --> 02:02:17.440]   Service workers with cash so that they don't have to declare it and give the government any of
[02:02:17.440 --> 02:02:25.600]   Once we go to a us central bank digital currency. It's not going to happen anymore. Here's a bit coin
[02:02:25.600 --> 02:02:32.240]   For the bergman. Yeah, my ami coin. Here's yeah. I wish I could though. I mean
[02:02:32.240 --> 02:02:38.480]   It's made up what to
[02:02:39.280 --> 02:02:40.080]   I
[02:02:40.080 --> 02:02:42.080]   Still write a couple of checks a year
[02:02:42.080 --> 02:02:46.960]   Exactly and then occasionally I have to deposit a check for something I fan mo
[02:02:46.960 --> 02:02:53.040]   I zell I pay pal I credit card. I do a lot of tapping in my apple watch
[02:02:53.040 --> 02:02:59.040]   It's funny how that's crutch up on us really right? I mean this two you three years ago
[02:02:59.040 --> 02:03:04.640]   I mocked it. I said well, how is that easier than getting a credit card out of your wallet? It's not that much of a difference
[02:03:04.640 --> 02:03:06.880]   It's so much easier
[02:03:08.080 --> 02:03:13.520]   I've done a similar thing recently. What's that first? Oh, I've done a similar thing recently and just that I
[02:03:13.520 --> 02:03:22.320]   Recently from dangerous things the bio hacker website. I recently got a prox mark easy. I think that's right. Wait a minute
[02:03:22.320 --> 02:03:24.880]   What is going on? I don't know what that is clone my
[02:03:24.880 --> 02:03:30.480]   Work ID card if you're uh our building security department don't listen to this
[02:03:30.480 --> 02:03:33.280]   To clone my work ID card and I put it on this ring
[02:03:33.680 --> 02:03:38.400]   So now all I have to do get into my work is just tap the ring. It's very fun
[02:03:38.400 --> 02:03:44.640]   You have a magic ring I do the magic ring the magic ring
[02:03:44.640 --> 02:03:47.200]   magic mi fatte one k
[02:03:47.200 --> 02:03:52.080]   So, okay. Here's another example. I bought something like this
[02:03:52.080 --> 02:03:58.560]   On kickstarter years ago. I gotta ever arrived it came but it never did anything
[02:03:59.600 --> 02:04:03.360]   But it was the same idea, right? So this has an rfid chip in it
[02:04:03.360 --> 02:04:07.440]   And it's got this uh my fair one k magic
[02:04:07.440 --> 02:04:10.480]   Gen 2 chip, which I guess is reprogrammable
[02:04:10.480 --> 02:04:15.840]   Yes, it is two different chips in it. They're reprogrammable. You use this thing
[02:04:15.840 --> 02:04:20.960]   It's kind of like a sniffer. Oh, I got you to hold up you use this thing you connected to your computer and
[02:04:20.960 --> 02:04:24.560]   Put your ID on it. You scan for the correct frequency
[02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:27.280]   copy the most of these chips are
[02:04:28.000 --> 02:04:31.920]   I didn't realize uh very insecure. They're just like nine numbers
[02:04:31.920 --> 02:04:35.280]   Copy those nine numbers over to this and it works
[02:04:35.280 --> 02:04:41.600]   Okay, okay, okay, okay, but you can only do one thing with it or two things if it's got two chips, right two things
[02:04:41.600 --> 02:04:44.320]   Yeah, so that ring can let you into work
[02:04:44.320 --> 02:04:51.520]   But nothing else and I mean if I had if I lived in a fancy building where I had to have a key fob
[02:04:51.520 --> 02:04:56.640]   It would work for that if I had a garage you could you know put your garage door click
[02:04:56.640 --> 02:05:02.160]   Could I do my car key fob on that? Yeah, maybe I don't know it depends what sort of the chip is
[02:05:02.160 --> 02:05:05.360]   I the one thing I know you can't do on these yet is uh
[02:05:05.360 --> 02:05:07.120]   payments
[02:05:07.120 --> 02:05:08.240]   Right
[02:05:08.240 --> 02:05:12.240]   You can already open your car with your phone anyway, Leo. Yeah, but it's unreliable
[02:05:12.240 --> 02:05:16.720]   Um, I've ended up, you know a lot of forts have keypads on the door
[02:05:16.720 --> 02:05:21.040]   I ended up just using that and I just you know, you have to look around make sure nobody's getting your number
[02:05:21.040 --> 02:05:22.640]   They're getting the car
[02:05:22.640 --> 02:05:28.000]   But uh, I'd be worried that it'd wear out the keys and then somebody could just get in my car by looking at it
[02:05:28.000 --> 02:05:33.200]   Oh, I didn't even think of that. Oh, yeah, because I don't ever wash my car. So there's definitely marks in the dust
[02:05:33.200 --> 02:05:36.080]   uh
[02:05:36.080 --> 02:05:37.760]   But uh
[02:05:37.760 --> 02:05:41.040]   What I mostly worry about is if it doesn't work and one time it didn't
[02:05:41.040 --> 02:05:46.480]   And then you're really like you can't it's like I can't do anything. I get getting my car
[02:05:47.040 --> 02:05:52.640]   So this does uh 125 kilohertz work badges key fobs and access cards
[02:05:52.640 --> 02:05:59.760]   So they have to be a little device is called a prox mark three easy. So you need the reader to to do
[02:05:59.760 --> 02:06:02.640]   So you can get that as well
[02:06:02.640 --> 02:06:05.840]   And even for someone I don't
[02:06:05.840 --> 02:06:10.000]   Code but I had to learn some basics for it for this and it was really easy
[02:06:10.000 --> 02:06:12.000]   186 bucks
[02:06:12.000 --> 02:06:15.600]   186 84 for both the reader and the kit
[02:06:16.400 --> 02:06:17.600]   Yeah
[02:06:17.600 --> 02:06:21.280]   You're I don't know if you need I don't know if you need the access kit, but
[02:06:21.280 --> 02:06:23.280]   I use the prox mark three
[02:06:23.280 --> 02:06:24.720]   I am living in the future the other day
[02:06:24.720 --> 02:06:29.200]   I did it and there were some other people in the elevator and there were all fancy businessmen and their suits
[02:06:29.200 --> 02:06:32.240]   And they were like oh my god. What is that? I was like, do you how do you do?
[02:06:32.240 --> 02:06:33.280]   Do you like you?
[02:06:33.280 --> 02:06:35.280]   Is there a little show off you like you go
[02:06:35.280 --> 02:06:37.280]   I you know like I uh
[02:06:37.280 --> 02:06:41.600]   I had to twist a little bit to get in the right side. I was like wave just a wave and I have it
[02:06:41.680 --> 02:06:46.400]   You know, it's much better than getting your card out of your wallet. I'll tell you that
[02:06:46.400 --> 02:06:52.720]   Wow, I we've all learned something today. Maybe not everybody but I have dangerous things magic rings
[02:06:52.720 --> 02:07:00.000]   I know I'm about a year away from getting a chip implanted myself. I know why I just get a chip
[02:07:00.000 --> 02:07:04.720]   Because then I'm like there's gonna be a better chip. Oh, yeah, that's right. What am I gonna do with the old chip?
[02:07:04.720 --> 02:07:07.440]   Well, just take it out. They'll always be a better chip
[02:07:07.440 --> 02:07:10.800]   That's my worry. It's like the usbc
[02:07:10.800 --> 02:07:14.640]   Yeah, exactly. Yeah, um, I can't you know going on one
[02:07:14.640 --> 02:07:18.640]   So this is what I mean. We're kind of gradually creeping up on
[02:07:18.640 --> 02:07:21.360]   Horizon new west
[02:07:21.360 --> 02:07:25.600]   We're gradually creeping up. I mean you need to learn a bit more about what happens at the end of that game
[02:07:25.600 --> 02:07:27.840]   Oh, okay, before you make it, but I mean yes
[02:07:27.840 --> 02:07:35.040]   For those who know it's the 31st century. So we got a little time, but we but but uh for somebody
[02:07:35.040 --> 02:07:38.880]   As old as me who's watched this go from you know
[02:07:40.080 --> 02:07:42.080]   a time X and Claire
[02:07:42.080 --> 02:07:45.040]   to magic rings from dangerous things
[02:07:45.040 --> 02:07:47.600]   I'm kind of living in a magical future
[02:07:47.600 --> 02:07:51.680]   And when a do you think it's accelerating. Do you feel like it's accelerating?
[02:07:51.680 --> 02:07:56.080]   Certainly. Yeah, I mean, yeah, I think that
[02:07:56.080 --> 02:08:01.280]   Probably whatever the technology powering this is only going to get smaller and more efficient
[02:08:01.280 --> 02:08:06.640]   Assuming we don't continue to have cascading supply chain issues. Well, that is probably going to get
[02:08:06.640 --> 02:08:09.520]   You know, that's the that's the other thing
[02:08:09.520 --> 02:08:14.560]   We we're learning is that we're living on the very tip of a house of cards tottering
[02:08:14.560 --> 02:08:19.920]   We're living in the millennium tower and we're sinking into garbage, but only one side
[02:08:19.920 --> 02:08:24.960]   But if we make it it's going to be great, but we but it's possible. It's got to collapse
[02:08:24.960 --> 02:08:27.360]   You know in a heap
[02:08:27.360 --> 02:08:31.360]   We're just kind of holding on saying please let's get to the future
[02:08:31.360 --> 02:08:35.520]   So I'm really thinking that there will be a cliff at one point where we'll wake up and go
[02:08:35.520 --> 02:08:37.440]   Yeah, you know
[02:08:37.440 --> 02:08:41.600]   a lot of the like like the temperature in my house is controlled by a
[02:08:41.600 --> 02:08:44.640]   Limited but but AI
[02:08:44.640 --> 02:08:49.440]   Things are starting to happen that the an AI controls you think that's going to have sam
[02:08:49.440 --> 02:08:54.000]   I mean the cars are really the forefront of this and vidya is designing all of these
[02:08:54.000 --> 02:08:59.520]   Chips that are becoming more and more powerful self-driving is definitely the cutting edge of this
[02:08:59.520 --> 02:09:02.800]   but AI has
[02:09:02.800 --> 02:09:05.520]   very significant limitations
[02:09:06.480 --> 02:09:11.440]   and you know the the truth is you know going back to you know the the lambda thing
[02:09:11.440 --> 02:09:19.200]   It's very it's good at mimicking intelligence. It's not intelligence and it still doesn't work
[02:09:19.200 --> 02:09:25.120]   the same way that the human brain does in perceiving the world around us
[02:09:25.120 --> 02:09:28.080]   and
[02:09:28.080 --> 02:09:31.840]   I you know like in in self-driving cars
[02:09:31.840 --> 02:09:35.680]   you have to have you have to give it guardrails because
[02:09:36.480 --> 02:09:39.760]   You know it can go very wrong in very unexpected ways
[02:09:39.760 --> 02:09:44.800]   You know for a lot of stuff, you know like things like customer service chatbots
[02:09:44.800 --> 02:09:48.720]   Yeah, it's fine. You know if it makes a mistake. It's not a big deal. Nobody dies
[02:09:48.720 --> 02:09:53.120]   You know in a safety critical system like an airplane or a car
[02:09:53.120 --> 02:09:55.360]   It's a very different scenario
[02:09:55.360 --> 02:09:57.360]   And so you have to build in those
[02:09:57.360 --> 02:10:03.120]   Determine those rules based guidelines that say you know if the AI makes the wrong decision
[02:10:03.440 --> 02:10:07.040]   You know it you're not going to allow it to go past these these limits
[02:10:07.040 --> 02:10:12.160]   um to try to minimize the the consequences of those mistakes
[02:10:12.160 --> 02:10:20.640]   Yeah, I mean I think that that's always true is that when new technologies come along you get both the positives and the negatives
[02:10:20.640 --> 02:10:25.760]   Right and you have and in fact you don't really know what the negatives are going to be until you're you're soaking in it
[02:10:25.760 --> 02:10:27.680]   And then you go
[02:10:27.680 --> 02:10:32.880]   This is not fun or well, you know another another aspect of this is you know
[02:10:33.600 --> 02:10:37.760]   We keep uh they keep realizing that the computing power that we have
[02:10:37.760 --> 02:10:42.400]   Is still nowhere near enough to do what they're trying to do
[02:10:42.400 --> 02:10:46.080]   You know if you go back, you know six years or so
[02:10:46.080 --> 02:10:52.800]   With invidia for example, you know when they they are yeah, I think it was about 2015 when they launched their first drive px
[02:10:52.800 --> 02:10:56.320]   uh computer for developing automated driving
[02:10:56.320 --> 02:11:02.080]   You know that thing had about one and a half or two terra ops of computing capability
[02:11:02.480 --> 02:11:08.480]   A couple of years later, they launched the Xavier chip, you know, which had 30 terra ops
[02:11:08.480 --> 02:11:12.720]   And they thought okay, this is going to be good enough to do level four autonomy
[02:11:12.720 --> 02:11:18.400]   Now then a couple of years after that they launched the orin which has 250 terra ops
[02:11:18.400 --> 02:11:20.800]   Yeah, this is going to be good enough to do level four autonomy
[02:11:20.800 --> 02:11:26.800]   Now last year they launched the atlin which has a thousand terra ops
[02:11:26.800 --> 02:11:30.800]   And that this is going to be the one you know, so it they
[02:11:31.200 --> 02:11:38.640]   The we don't know what we don't know and this you know this all this stuff is proving to be a lot harder to do than anybody really imagined
[02:11:38.640 --> 02:11:45.680]   Yeah, and we need more and more computing power eventually. We'll we'll probably get there, but yeah, we're not there yet. It is you know, it is
[02:11:45.680 --> 02:11:48.880]   simultaneously
[02:11:48.880 --> 02:11:54.080]   Harder than we thought and it's happening faster than we expect so it's kind of a weird
[02:11:54.080 --> 02:11:58.400]   uh stupat of expectations, uh, we're sitting in
[02:11:59.200 --> 02:12:05.920]   uh former amazon engineer convicted of stealing 100,000 i'm sorry 100 million
[02:12:05.920 --> 02:12:07.760]   uh
[02:12:07.760 --> 02:12:11.440]   records from the capital one hack one of the biggest security breaches ever
[02:12:11.440 --> 02:12:14.160]   in the us page tomsen
[02:12:14.160 --> 02:12:16.320]   uh wrote a tool
[02:12:16.320 --> 02:12:20.400]   to scan amazon web services for misconfigured accounts as one does
[02:12:20.400 --> 02:12:25.040]   She found uh capital ones database of users
[02:12:25.760 --> 02:12:31.840]   Infiltrated it downloaded 100 million people's data in the us six million in canada
[02:12:31.840 --> 02:12:37.040]   Uh, she says i'm an ethical hacker. I was just pen testing
[02:12:37.040 --> 02:12:45.600]   The jury said no you're a hacker hacker and convicted her of a pretty significant
[02:12:45.600 --> 02:12:48.400]   uh, she's got uh
[02:12:48.400 --> 02:12:51.600]   Up to 20 years of prison time. She's facing for wire fraud
[02:12:52.240 --> 02:12:56.320]   And up to five years for each charge of illegally accessing a protected
[02:12:56.320 --> 02:13:01.680]   computer, uh, she could go to jail for a long time sentencing is in september
[02:13:01.680 --> 02:13:05.120]   Um
[02:13:05.120 --> 02:13:10.400]   Do you remember we talked about this a couple of weeks ago that the justice department said that well, we're not gonna
[02:13:10.400 --> 02:13:13.680]   We're not going to use a computer fraud and abuse act to
[02:13:13.680 --> 02:13:17.360]   Abuse people of us. We have in the past very famously
[02:13:17.920 --> 02:13:22.720]   It was wire and short skilled himself because he was being hounded by the feds
[02:13:22.720 --> 02:13:29.200]   Uh, her lawyers said she used the same tools and methods that act the heck all hackers use
[02:13:29.200 --> 02:13:34.240]   But I think when you download 100 million records, even if you don't do anything with it
[02:13:34.240 --> 02:13:39.360]   Yeah, maybe you shouldn't have done that. What do you think
[02:13:39.360 --> 02:13:43.760]   Any any uh extenuating circumstances
[02:13:46.160 --> 02:13:52.160]   I remember downloading it is a bit of a complicated way to go about it. Yeah, I remember when this happened
[02:13:52.160 --> 02:13:55.600]   I was really suspicious because we never saw this information on the dark web
[02:13:55.600 --> 02:13:59.280]   And I said well to me that means it's a nation state
[02:13:59.280 --> 02:14:04.960]   That isn't trying to make money off of this information, but use somebody like china or russia using it
[02:14:04.960 --> 02:14:07.680]   you know for further
[02:14:07.680 --> 02:14:12.800]   Compromat or you know, just whatever it is china does with all that tick-tock information
[02:14:13.520 --> 02:14:16.160]   But no nation state or is it page or it's page
[02:14:16.160 --> 02:14:20.560]   It's either page tumsen or a nation state
[02:14:20.560 --> 02:14:24.720]   I I mean also, you know, she was working at amazon
[02:14:24.720 --> 02:14:28.640]   Did amazon ask her to do this? I think that's you know
[02:14:28.640 --> 02:14:35.600]   You know very questionable. Um, there's a great area. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. There's a we have a good friend
[02:14:35.600 --> 02:14:40.560]   Randall Schwartz who for a long time hosted this uh the floss show for us of open source show
[02:14:40.720 --> 02:14:46.480]   He's a pearl wizard. He also was convicted of hacking many years ago worked at intel
[02:14:46.480 --> 02:14:48.880]   uh, and
[02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:52.800]   Thought there was a security issue not in his division, but another division
[02:14:52.800 --> 02:14:55.200]   Uh
[02:14:55.200 --> 02:14:59.200]   Pen tested it. I don't think he did anything. He's always said I wasn't hacking
[02:14:59.200 --> 02:15:06.080]   I was exploring I and I found a flaw and I reported it to intel and he was immediately arrested and prosecuted and jailed
[02:15:06.080 --> 02:15:09.840]   so uh, there is a long history of
[02:15:10.560 --> 02:15:14.160]   Yeah, we don't want you, you know pro probing these weaknesses
[02:15:14.160 --> 02:15:18.160]   Security through obscurity. Yeah
[02:15:18.160 --> 02:15:21.840]   So but that I don't I don't know if if that's
[02:15:21.840 --> 02:15:29.440]   What happened here, right? I mean you don't want to discourage security research, right? Um, but
[02:15:29.440 --> 02:15:32.960]   you know is it is a creating this kind of
[02:15:32.960 --> 02:15:39.280]   You know umbrella under which people who are not doing security research can hide incidentally
[02:15:39.680 --> 02:15:42.800]   10 years later, and I should add this to the story. It's very important
[02:15:42.800 --> 02:15:47.840]   uh 10 years after his conviction his uh, he was cleared and his
[02:15:47.840 --> 02:15:49.840]   uh
[02:15:49.840 --> 02:15:51.840]   His uh conviction was expunged
[02:15:51.840 --> 02:15:57.280]   So I only tell the story because he tells it. He's not he's very public about it
[02:15:57.280 --> 02:15:59.840]   But that gives you a you know a really good example
[02:15:59.840 --> 02:16:02.800]   Of and randal was always that way when we
[02:16:02.800 --> 02:16:08.720]   used to go and get cruises i've gone on get cruises with him and uh at the time the cruise ships
[02:16:09.280 --> 02:16:11.280]   Wi-fi was not encrypted
[02:16:11.280 --> 02:16:16.720]   So I remember him coming up and handing me a piece of paper saying is this your email password
[02:16:16.720 --> 02:16:25.440]   It is yes, he said well, I thought you should know so, you know, he's doing me a favor, but it's also like
[02:16:25.440 --> 02:16:28.240]   I mean
[02:16:28.240 --> 02:16:32.080]   I can see why people might have been kind of freaked out. He used a program
[02:16:32.080 --> 02:16:35.040]   at intel uh to crack the passwords of
[02:16:35.040 --> 02:16:38.320]   colleagues at the intel supercomputer systems division
[02:16:39.200 --> 02:16:41.200]   um
[02:16:41.200 --> 02:16:43.200]   A geek cruise and thought
[02:16:43.200 --> 02:16:46.240]   Unencrypted Wi-Fi is this was back in the day
[02:16:46.240 --> 02:16:49.280]   When uh, nobody
[02:16:49.280 --> 02:16:54.640]   No, any people were building their internet with pencils and rocks. Yeah, well you can tell it was because
[02:16:54.640 --> 02:16:58.960]   There is no email system in the world today that doesn't use hg tps
[02:16:58.960 --> 02:17:01.760]   You can't interact with it and send a password in the clear
[02:17:01.760 --> 02:17:05.680]   Right. I mean if you log into your gmail that password is not floating through the air
[02:17:05.680 --> 02:17:11.600]   Even if your Wi-Fi was unencrypted, but in back in those days both the Wi-Fi was unencrypted and it was http
[02:17:11.600 --> 02:17:14.080]   Was an unencrypted connection
[02:17:14.080 --> 02:17:17.600]   So it reminds me of the the tales I've heard about defcon where yes
[02:17:17.600 --> 02:17:24.000]   If you if you go in there and your obseck is not 100 percent tight like there are people just waiting pounds
[02:17:24.000 --> 02:17:26.720]   That's when I changed my password for monkey 123
[02:17:26.720 --> 02:17:31.040]   To monkey 1234 and uh and it's been secure ever since
[02:17:31.040 --> 02:17:33.680]   All the difference
[02:17:33.840 --> 02:17:35.840]   The difference between weak and strong
[02:17:35.840 --> 02:17:39.040]   Uh
[02:17:39.040 --> 02:17:43.280]   Apple is unionizing this is got has got to be scary
[02:17:43.280 --> 02:17:48.880]   For tim cook, but if I would say, you know if you don't want your employees to unionize
[02:17:48.880 --> 02:17:53.600]   Treat them right apple workers at tousin marilin's apple store
[02:17:53.600 --> 02:18:00.640]   The first apple entity to unionize two-thirds of employees voted to unionize even though
[02:18:01.360 --> 02:18:08.240]   Um, well apple tried really hard to talk them out of it even recording a video from apple's
[02:18:08.240 --> 02:18:12.960]   Retail head didro brian saying we're a family
[02:18:12.960 --> 02:18:18.960]   Juche oh that argument always really works as well when it comes to you workers uprising
[02:18:18.960 --> 02:18:24.240]   We move quickly. You don't need anybody in between uh you and us negotiating
[02:18:24.240 --> 02:18:28.400]   They even was uh was that video taken from apple's giant
[02:18:28.400 --> 02:18:29.600]   uh
[02:18:29.600 --> 02:18:31.600]   Glass headquarters. Yes
[02:18:31.600 --> 02:18:37.760]   And at some point somebody running along in track shorts through a giant hammer through it. No, not someone that's another video
[02:18:37.760 --> 02:18:39.200]   Uh
[02:18:39.200 --> 02:18:43.040]   They did raise their wages from $20 an hour to $22
[02:18:43.040 --> 02:18:48.160]   Starting at wage although you might make the argument they did that in response to the unionization effort proving
[02:18:48.160 --> 02:18:51.520]   That apple could have done that a long time ago and didn't
[02:18:51.520 --> 02:18:55.280]   Uh, they are now a member of core
[02:18:56.800 --> 02:19:04.480]   Which uh stands for I get get it apple core the apple coalition of organized retail employees
[02:19:04.480 --> 02:19:06.960]   which will be
[02:19:06.960 --> 02:19:11.200]   part of the international association of machinists and aerospace workers
[02:19:11.200 --> 02:19:18.800]   So, uh, that's okay. I'm in this great sense. You know the genius bar workers who are
[02:19:18.800 --> 02:19:25.280]   In your aerospace sure. Yeah, uh, machinist. I'm just you know bravo. This has been a trend starbucks's
[02:19:25.840 --> 02:19:31.120]   fought unisations. They've hired as apple did uh law firms to you know discourage
[02:19:31.120 --> 02:19:35.200]   Unisation, uh and yet starbucks stores are one by one
[02:19:35.200 --> 02:19:40.000]   Becoming unionized and this is the first apple store to become unionized and I think that's fine
[02:19:40.000 --> 02:19:41.680]   I think that's great if that's
[02:19:41.680 --> 02:19:43.680]   You know what good
[02:19:43.680 --> 02:19:49.840]   I think it'd be really fun to look at how much they're paying these uh big law firms and you're investing companies
[02:19:50.080 --> 02:19:56.880]   And then divide that by the number of workers that they have in these one stores and compare that with the two dollar an hour wage and great exactly
[02:19:56.880 --> 02:20:02.880]   Well, think imagine what amazon is spent to keep the unions out of the warehouses. I mean, it's so much
[02:20:02.880 --> 02:20:05.600]   You that's your beat right you cover that
[02:20:05.600 --> 02:20:12.240]   Yeah, they've spent a considerable amount and they really spurred the bootch with the new york warehouse
[02:20:12.240 --> 02:20:18.080]   and it seems like that trend could continue are they gonna get in trouble with the nlrb or
[02:20:19.360 --> 02:20:24.880]   I mean, they're trying to right now. They are fighting tooth and nail against kind of the unionization
[02:20:24.880 --> 02:20:30.560]   Uh that had happened at their new york city warehouse specifically arguing that the nlrb
[02:20:30.560 --> 02:20:37.280]   Was acting in a biased manner in addition to the union workers action in a biased manner. It's a very complicated
[02:20:37.280 --> 02:20:38.880]   Very
[02:20:38.880 --> 02:20:43.520]   The national labor relations board which protects your right to vote for a union
[02:20:43.520 --> 02:20:47.840]   And does very much circumscribe what a company can do to fight a union. Although
[02:20:48.560 --> 02:20:51.120]   Companies like amazon have these compulsory
[02:20:51.120 --> 02:20:57.040]   Meetings where they you know harangue basically and give you all the reasons we're family
[02:20:57.040 --> 02:21:04.480]   Well, why would you want to do this to your family? Yes, these are big papa. Yeah, let big papa choose yourself
[02:21:04.480 --> 02:21:07.600]   Can I throw out a crazy idea here? Yes
[02:21:07.600 --> 02:21:12.240]   Could unionization be the best thing that ever happened to amazon
[02:21:12.240 --> 02:21:17.280]   Because they have a labor crisis that is so bad. They did a study an internal study
[02:21:17.920 --> 02:21:22.640]   about where they're going to run out of workers they can even hire and
[02:21:22.640 --> 02:21:28.720]   You know, they're already there in some markets and they're you know, they're thinking about where they open up a warehouse
[02:21:28.720 --> 02:21:34.320]   They've been studying like what's the labor market there? You've got crazy turnover. Uh, you know of
[02:21:34.320 --> 02:21:37.040]   More than 100 percent, which means
[02:21:37.040 --> 02:21:42.000]   You know, they turn you know like the average employee doesn't even last a year in an amazon warehouse
[02:21:42.000 --> 02:21:46.000]   so maybe if these unions come along and
[02:21:46.640 --> 02:21:49.200]   insist on better working conditions
[02:21:49.200 --> 02:21:54.640]   Amazon might save more money in you know, not having to
[02:21:54.640 --> 02:21:56.560]   hunt down
[02:21:56.560 --> 02:21:58.720]   You know new recruits and train them
[02:21:58.720 --> 02:22:06.000]   Then they'll ever pay and sell you know increase salary and benefits that they negotiate with the units just a crazy scenario
[02:22:06.000 --> 02:22:08.800]   What why doesn't amazon do a really good idea?
[02:22:08.800 --> 02:22:14.960]   Well, the reason from amazon's perspective the reason why they're anti-union despite you know, I mean
[02:22:16.080 --> 02:22:21.280]   Is because amazon's whole ecosystem. It's kind of like our current supply chain graces
[02:22:21.280 --> 02:22:24.800]   It was all kind of hanging on by a single thread amazon
[02:22:24.800 --> 02:22:31.440]   At every quarter would increase the number of workers or decrease it dramatically depending on their
[02:22:31.440 --> 02:22:36.640]   kind of needs during the fourth quarter of the year the holiday season amazon needs a
[02:22:36.640 --> 02:22:39.120]   Considerable amount like they have to add
[02:22:39.120 --> 02:22:44.000]   Hundreds of thousands of people to their workforce every fourth quarter and then normally the first quarter
[02:22:44.400 --> 02:22:51.520]   They fire a lot of those people or uh pay them to quit as kind of the program or they'll pay you to never work in amazon place again
[02:22:51.520 --> 02:22:54.320]   Um, but they can't do that if there's a union
[02:22:54.320 --> 02:22:59.680]   They can't continue to kind of have their cake and eat it too when it comes to the labor market of
[02:22:59.680 --> 02:23:05.440]   Just have enough employees for every single moment and not have too many during the other quarters
[02:23:05.440 --> 02:23:07.440]   if they have a
[02:23:07.440 --> 02:23:13.680]   An intermediate force that is looking out for the benefits of the workers and looking to make sure that these workers
[02:23:14.160 --> 02:23:19.200]   Stay on for more than a year because that would mean you'd have this huge surplus of workers
[02:23:19.200 --> 02:23:26.320]   Which isn't good from an efficiency standpoint because you cover amazon paris you know better than most, you know the you know
[02:23:26.320 --> 02:23:30.720]   What's like to work at amazon and whether it's a
[02:23:30.720 --> 02:23:33.600]   Fair company a good company
[02:23:33.600 --> 02:23:36.480]   Let me ask you given what you know. Do you shop at amazon?
[02:23:36.480 --> 02:23:41.760]   I will occasionally buy stuff from amazon, but I also I mean selfishly I think
[02:23:42.640 --> 02:23:48.080]   As someone who covers amazon reports and a lot of aspects of it if anybody can shop at amazon, it can be me
[02:23:48.080 --> 02:23:50.400]   Um, but it's also
[02:23:50.400 --> 02:23:54.160]   It's part of my job in the sense that sometimes i'll be like looking through something and amazon
[02:23:54.160 --> 02:23:59.360]   I'm like, huh? I've noticed something different about the way this is working. Yeah, let me figure out the inside story and that
[02:23:59.360 --> 02:24:01.920]   Having that brand exposure kind of helps
[02:24:01.920 --> 02:24:04.640]   but I also I mean, I don't know I think that
[02:24:04.640 --> 02:24:07.440]   ultimately
[02:24:07.440 --> 02:24:12.400]   All corporations are a bit inherently evil if you're thinking about it on a purely
[02:24:12.400 --> 02:24:16.320]   big big goodness. Yeah big corporations. Yeah. Yeah, I mean like
[02:24:16.320 --> 02:24:20.560]   Not quite that not quit, you know
[02:24:20.560 --> 02:24:28.880]   All companies but sweat. Yeah, you know big corporations with larger acronyms than four letters. Yes. Um, yes
[02:24:28.880 --> 02:24:35.280]   Yeah, but I mean I I think that I feel really guilty buying stuff at amazon, but I I'm afraid I have
[02:24:35.280 --> 02:24:41.280]   I'm addicted. I mean I think the thing is like people say that then they go buy a like
[02:24:42.240 --> 02:24:44.240]   Furniture from way fair
[02:24:44.240 --> 02:24:50.240]   Any better to go away fair or walmart. I agree like they buy from these the other options that we have are often
[02:24:50.240 --> 02:24:52.800]   Well, it's worse. There's in a similar way
[02:24:52.800 --> 02:24:54.880]   Uh, I mean
[02:24:54.880 --> 02:24:59.520]   It depends on what measure you're using to define worse or better in these sort of situations
[02:24:59.520 --> 02:25:03.600]   But you're like I don't know the whole thing with she and the fast fashion company
[02:25:03.600 --> 02:25:06.480]   It's like we don't know where these pieces of clothing are coming
[02:25:06.480 --> 02:25:09.760]   You gotta figure it's made by slave labor in a camp in china
[02:25:09.840 --> 02:25:12.560]   You know it is a two dollar shirt
[02:25:12.560 --> 02:25:15.120]   It's you know that there's no way
[02:25:15.120 --> 02:25:22.240]   Had a really great uh kind of I think there's maybe a profile piece about chan kind of going through how it became what it was
[02:25:22.240 --> 02:25:24.320]   It was in the last couple of months and
[02:25:24.320 --> 02:25:28.880]   Chianta to certain like or at least people who were very senior and she hadn't spoke to this reporter
[02:25:28.880 --> 02:25:32.000]   I'm admitted like they don't really know where a lot of their stuff comes from
[02:25:32.000 --> 02:25:36.000]   They just kind of have contracts with a lot of different companies and they just say
[02:25:36.880 --> 02:25:40.960]   Give us a hundred of something and then if that hundred sells out they're like give us more
[02:25:40.960 --> 02:25:44.800]   Right and they don't have that much of an insight into where it's coming from
[02:25:44.800 --> 02:25:49.040]   I think that's happening all throughout the supply chain and obviously amazon is one example of that
[02:25:49.040 --> 02:25:50.880]   But there are also so many
[02:25:50.880 --> 02:25:55.920]   But the reason why I find it fascinating to focus on amazon is because it is obviously such a huge presence in our life
[02:25:55.920 --> 02:25:59.040]   And like focusing on this one aspect of it is
[02:25:59.040 --> 02:26:04.160]   Obviously you notice trends that have a larger impact than a smaller company
[02:26:04.160 --> 02:26:07.520]   And half the time when you buy from amazon literally half the time you're buying from a third party
[02:26:07.520 --> 02:26:10.400]   This probably has buying it stuff from chian
[02:26:10.400 --> 02:26:15.760]   Or and she and like company. Yeah, so yeah, yeah, I get it both ways
[02:26:15.760 --> 02:26:19.440]   I'm participating in this marvelous capitalist economy
[02:26:19.440 --> 02:26:22.400]   Full throttle

[02:28:37.360 --> 02:28:42.000]   That was your headphones in that he looks like he needs this this brush this over here
[02:28:42.000 --> 02:28:47.360]   Oh yeah, is that weathered or grizzled? What are we gonna call it? That's weathered
[02:28:47.600 --> 02:28:49.600]   [Laughter]
[02:28:49.600 --> 02:28:52.000]   Previously on twit. I didn't know they were
[02:28:52.000 --> 02:28:57.920]   Dissecurity now. I stumbled upon a proof that we are indeed living in a simulation
[02:28:57.920 --> 02:29:05.840]   When you attempt to plug in one of those original usba style plugs the plugs orientation would be wrong
[02:29:05.840 --> 02:29:11.760]   Only half the time the first time we attempt to plug in one of those
[02:29:11.760 --> 02:29:14.240]   It is almost always
[02:29:14.400 --> 02:29:16.400]   Wrong always always isn't it?
[02:29:16.400 --> 02:29:24.240]   Windows weekly we feel like the insider program and the windows team needs to come forward and do some explaining about
[02:29:24.240 --> 02:29:27.440]   How are you rolling out features to people?
[02:29:27.440 --> 02:29:29.600]   Look if you're going to disappoint people
[02:29:29.600 --> 02:29:35.040]   Do it because you didn't disrupt things is you're you're creating a platform here. We're not this isn't like a balloon store
[02:29:35.040 --> 02:29:37.360]   It's not supposed to be fun
[02:29:37.360 --> 02:29:43.440]   This week in google nonsense on stilts lambda is not sentient not even
[02:29:43.920 --> 02:29:47.600]   Lightly it's just a matter of time before a deep fake is created
[02:29:47.600 --> 02:29:50.400]   That's so good that we don't know is it if it's a deep fake or not
[02:29:50.400 --> 02:29:56.080]   We have empathy modules. I think you gave yourself a way there when you said we have empathy modules twit
[02:29:56.080 --> 02:29:58.720]   Stacy is there anything?
[02:29:58.720 --> 02:30:07.920]   We have empathy modules empathy modules are on full turn them up all the way
[02:30:07.920 --> 02:30:10.880]   um
[02:30:10.880 --> 02:30:13.760]   Couple more stories. I want to wrap it up, but I but I can't resist
[02:30:13.760 --> 02:30:18.720]   Saying thank god the white house has launched a task force
[02:30:18.720 --> 02:30:23.680]   To curb online abuse. I think we consider this problem solved
[02:30:23.680 --> 02:30:28.480]   I thought maloney haven't been at least 30 seconds
[02:30:28.480 --> 02:30:32.560]   Uh
[02:30:32.560 --> 02:30:35.520]   I don't know what a task force is going to do to solve online abuse
[02:30:35.520 --> 02:30:39.360]   But I think it's probably going to do no more than nielon musk will
[02:30:39.680 --> 02:30:41.680]   Uh, let's put it that way
[02:30:41.680 --> 02:30:47.680]   Uh, let's see what else corry doctor. Oh great piece by the way. I love corry's blog
[02:30:47.680 --> 02:30:49.760]   We're gonna get corry on twit again very soon
[02:30:49.760 --> 02:30:54.400]   Great piece about prop 22 remember this in the uh
[02:30:54.400 --> 02:30:58.000]   California. Oh, and I'm sure you remember it. Well, this was
[02:30:58.000 --> 02:31:00.160]   They spent
[02:31:00.160 --> 02:31:05.680]   youber and lift spent hundreds of millions of dollars to convince california voters that people like working
[02:31:06.160 --> 02:31:08.160]   For uber and lift
[02:31:08.160 --> 02:31:12.480]   And you should pass a proposition that allows gig work
[02:31:12.480 --> 02:31:14.400]   Remember that
[02:31:14.400 --> 02:31:16.720]   Proposition passed by a landslide
[02:31:16.720 --> 02:31:21.040]   Turns out corry says the lawyers who drafted it
[02:31:21.040 --> 02:31:24.000]   Really blew it
[02:31:24.000 --> 02:31:26.000]   it's unconstitutional
[02:31:26.000 --> 02:31:32.320]   And uh, the california superior court has voided prop two in its entirety
[02:31:32.880 --> 02:31:37.440]   The 225 million dollars that uber and lift spent to get it passed
[02:31:37.440 --> 02:31:41.040]   Uh
[02:31:41.040 --> 02:31:42.160]   wasted
[02:31:42.160 --> 02:31:46.400]   In fact, I think they they took that same legislation and went to massachusetts
[02:31:46.400 --> 02:31:49.760]   They probably have gone in new york as well. They love this idea
[02:31:49.760 --> 02:31:52.480]   um
[02:31:52.480 --> 02:31:58.080]   Anyway, of course as I can't imagine how you go ahead with a hundred million dollar ballot initiative campaign
[02:31:58.080 --> 02:32:01.200]   Without gaming out how it'll play in court
[02:32:01.680 --> 02:32:05.520]   I mean sure your boss is going to freak out if you fairly described the ballot initiatives
[02:32:05.520 --> 02:32:08.080]   Lopsided language in the voter guide summary
[02:32:08.080 --> 02:32:12.880]   But the lawyer's job is to explain that failing to do so could wreck the whole thing and it
[02:32:12.880 --> 02:32:14.880]   Did
[02:32:14.880 --> 02:32:20.080]   Listen a lot of people got big bonuses that year. That's all that matters. That's all that it is
[02:32:20.080 --> 02:32:26.560]   Is that short term that's short term thing for a term game, you know, you know, but by uber standards, you know
[02:32:27.120 --> 02:32:33.840]   Blowing 225 million dollars is peanuts. I mean, you know, they've burned through tens of billions. That's a good point
[02:32:33.840 --> 02:32:36.240]   That's a good point. I don't like they're trying to make money here
[02:32:36.240 --> 02:32:42.320]   Have you watched we crashed have you been watching we crashed with an Hathaway and jared leto
[02:32:42.320 --> 02:32:47.440]   No, because my life is thinking about oh, yeah, it would be entertaining. Would it?
[02:32:47.440 --> 02:32:51.280]   Yeah, plus you know so much you'd look at it go well, that's wrong
[02:32:51.280 --> 02:32:55.040]   But I have to say I am it is hysterical
[02:32:55.760 --> 02:32:57.760]   Just watch the first episode
[02:32:57.760 --> 02:33:03.760]   It's the end he started they start with the end what uh services that one on uh apple tv apple tv. Yeah
[02:33:03.760 --> 02:33:07.360]   Have you watched another one that another one? You know, I
[02:33:07.360 --> 02:33:11.920]   I uh, I really got into hulu's uh the dropout
[02:33:11.920 --> 02:33:14.160]   but my husband refused to
[02:33:14.160 --> 02:33:20.320]   Refuse to watch it with me what he says. He talked about that stuff too much as it is. Yeah. He is the same thing
[02:33:20.880 --> 02:33:27.520]   Have you shown him the uh video of her dancing in the little office? She dances like a lane
[02:33:27.520 --> 02:33:29.760]   So it'll fell
[02:33:29.760 --> 02:33:32.160]   It was really good
[02:33:32.160 --> 02:33:34.160]   With the puffy vest on
[02:33:34.160 --> 02:33:36.160]   And the puffy vest
[02:33:36.160 --> 02:33:42.320]   Uh, I guess her sentencing they finished the sunny trial did he get convicted? I don't it's like no, it's uh
[02:33:42.320 --> 02:33:48.400]   Uh, let's see final arguments actually our Tuesday. They got pushed back this week. It'll finish. Okay
[02:33:48.400 --> 02:33:53.040]   Her uh her sentencing is not until I believe September right this fall. Yeah
[02:33:53.040 --> 02:33:58.080]   So sunny balwani her one time a boyfriend and uh
[02:33:58.080 --> 02:34:03.280]   Chief operating officer. I think get the tharinos was also tried, but they were tried separately. So
[02:34:03.280 --> 02:34:06.000]   Correct. We shall see what happens
[02:34:06.000 --> 02:34:08.640]   Uh good news
[02:34:08.640 --> 02:34:11.040]   You don't have to go naked in the metaverse
[02:34:11.040 --> 02:34:17.360]   meta is launching this week a digital clothing store where you can purchase outfits
[02:34:18.240 --> 02:34:23.520]   For your avatar. This is the lamest thing I've ever seen in my life, but wait this looks worse than second life
[02:34:23.520 --> 02:34:27.120]   Wait, it does. That's a funny thing 20 years ago. We could do this
[02:34:27.120 --> 02:34:31.840]   Uh, but these are not just any outfits. These are from balanciaga
[02:34:31.840 --> 02:34:33.680]   Prada
[02:34:33.680 --> 02:34:38.800]   Tom brown. These are designer. Look it says balanciaga on her designer sweatshirt
[02:34:38.800 --> 02:34:42.480]   Okay, this is going to date me, but I keep thinking of that
[02:34:43.040 --> 02:34:47.120]   Rapid from about 10 years ago. That's like gucci gucci fendi fendi
[02:34:47.120 --> 02:34:50.000]   Louis louis prada
[02:34:50.000 --> 02:34:55.200]   You know that your brand it's uh, did you watch house of gucci? There's another great one man jared leto again
[02:34:55.200 --> 02:34:59.600]   With the worst Italian accent. It's like hey, it's a me Mario
[02:34:59.600 --> 02:35:07.280]   In a fat suit no less, but uh, oh no guys. We can't be doing fat suits
[02:35:07.280 --> 02:35:10.320]   Well, he's a skinny skinny guy
[02:35:10.560 --> 02:35:12.560]   Uh, someone else
[02:35:12.560 --> 02:35:20.960]   I as a fat man. I feel like they're discriminating against us and uh, we they should let people of a certain curse play the the the chubby rolls
[02:35:20.960 --> 02:35:22.960]   anyway, uh
[02:35:22.960 --> 02:35:24.560]   Well, oh gucci
[02:35:24.560 --> 02:35:30.800]   Perfect example by the time you are selling fake clothing in a metaverse your brand is shot right
[02:35:30.800 --> 02:35:39.520]   Gucci now they put their brand on anything right it's just shot and I have to think this does not reflect well on balanciaga Prada and tom brown
[02:35:40.480 --> 02:35:49.040]   Tom brown also has uh special samsung watch styles if you want so he's not thinking like what was that meeting in between like meta
[02:35:49.040 --> 02:35:55.200]   People and balanciaga or Prada. What was that meeting like? They're like, we've got a really great opportunity for you
[02:35:55.200 --> 02:36:01.120]   We want you to brand in the metaverse. They're like, oh wow. You know what they said they said
[02:36:01.120 --> 02:36:04.080]   money
[02:36:04.080 --> 02:36:06.080]   Dina
[02:36:06.080 --> 02:36:08.720]   I mean honestly
[02:36:09.440 --> 02:36:11.120]   This has got to be they've got to be looking. I mean
[02:36:11.120 --> 02:36:18.160]   Second life for all its dopiness people made a lot of linden dollars. I don't know if they ever made money on it, but they
[02:36:18.160 --> 02:36:19.840]   I mean
[02:36:19.840 --> 02:36:25.200]   Linden dollars were used to do them a lot of money laundering also, are they really I think I mean, no
[02:36:25.200 --> 02:36:30.400]   I'm not slandering the linden good name, but I thought that it all started with second life, baby
[02:36:30.400 --> 02:36:32.480]   It all started there
[02:36:32.480 --> 02:36:36.720]   Yeah, the creators of second life got to be kicking themselves like we just had to call it the metaverse
[02:36:37.920 --> 02:36:44.480]   Why aren't these outfits nft's am I missing something? Oh, yeah, if you really want to capitalize on it sure
[02:36:44.480 --> 02:36:47.120]   There are games now with the nft's
[02:36:47.120 --> 02:36:54.880]   And the best thing is like if you buy and sell the stuff you end up with a massive tax bill at the end of the year
[02:36:54.880 --> 02:37:01.600]   Like you've got a URL and a massive tax bill congratulations
[02:37:01.600 --> 02:37:05.600]   Speaking of games and loot boxes
[02:37:06.400 --> 02:37:12.960]   Diablo immortal came out on the iPad and the apple iphone just two weeks ago
[02:37:12.960 --> 02:37:14.800]   Uh
[02:37:14.800 --> 02:37:21.280]   It's funny. The reviews were very positive for users hate it because it is really a pay-to-play game
[02:37:21.280 --> 02:37:23.440]   It's free to download
[02:37:23.440 --> 02:37:29.440]   But there is so much stuff that you have to buy. I actually think it's a fun game because I love diablo
[02:37:29.440 --> 02:37:32.240]   Uh, and it's fun to have it on my iPad
[02:37:32.560 --> 02:37:40.000]   How much have you spent on microtrad? I have spent nothing but I am one of the few because they made in the first two weeks 24 million
[02:37:40.000 --> 02:37:41.680]   dollars
[02:37:41.680 --> 02:37:43.680]   on microtransactions
[02:37:43.680 --> 02:37:49.520]   Question if you I guess make one of these transactions while playing on your ipad is that a macro transaction?
[02:37:49.520 --> 02:37:54.320]   I just want to point out that of the 24 million dollars
[02:37:54.320 --> 02:37:58.560]   They only got 16 because apple gets eight
[02:37:58.560 --> 02:38:01.440]   Yeah, right
[02:38:01.760 --> 02:38:03.760]   so
[02:38:03.760 --> 02:38:05.760]   I don't know what to say after that
[02:38:05.760 --> 02:38:07.840]   There you go
[02:38:07.840 --> 02:38:11.920]   Nice nice work if you can get it. Yeah freaking out. Yeah freaking out
[02:38:11.920 --> 02:38:19.840]   Um, all right. I think we I think uh, i'm looking what else. Um, I don't think we care about the nothing phone
[02:38:19.840 --> 02:38:23.440]   What?
[02:38:23.440 --> 02:38:29.760]   There is a phone who decided that was a good name for a product carl pay who was the former head of one plus
[02:38:30.480 --> 02:38:32.480]   uh left one plus when um
[02:38:32.480 --> 02:38:38.640]   Oppo bought it brought it back in house. I think it was an Oppo operation all along, but they brought it back in house and he left
[02:38:38.640 --> 02:38:40.960]   he bought the I think he bought the
[02:38:40.960 --> 02:38:45.760]   Assets of andy rubins essential, which was another failed phony announced
[02:38:45.760 --> 02:38:50.800]   We're gonna make a phone called nothing and we're gonna and we're gonna reveal it july 12th
[02:38:50.800 --> 02:38:54.640]   Except there was I think so little interest that they then now leaked
[02:38:54.640 --> 02:38:57.520]   this design
[02:38:57.840 --> 02:39:04.560]   Because come on really guys. It's it's gonna be great. Wait. It's called the phone one the phone one by nah
[02:39:04.560 --> 02:39:08.160]   It's it they've they've run out of ideas
[02:39:08.160 --> 02:39:11.040]   The plus one they've run out of ideas
[02:39:11.040 --> 02:39:18.960]   Uh here it is with its central led lights drip. I don't I don't know what's going on. I don't know what
[02:39:18.960 --> 02:39:24.400]   Is that it's happening? Like you remember was it a handspring visor or a uh
[02:39:25.040 --> 02:39:31.360]   Or a palm pilot that was handspring. They're having a transparent case. Oh, I loved that. That was I have one in the other room
[02:39:31.360 --> 02:39:33.600]   Yeah, those are great my wife had one for a while
[02:39:33.600 --> 02:39:39.360]   Those weren't bad. They were basically pilots, right? Yeah, that was a good device with the visor module
[02:39:39.360 --> 02:39:42.480]   All right
