[00:03:11.340 --> 00:03:13.220]   something very interesting
[00:03:13.220 --> 00:03:16.300]   you sent me a note this week i think we all read it days of a couple of posts on
[00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:17.700]   medium
[00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:21.340]   uh... about detoxing
[00:03:21.340 --> 00:03:25.580]   yes from data from our from our data apocalypse that is
[00:03:25.580 --> 00:03:28.740]   always seems just upon us but i i did a personal
[00:03:28.740 --> 00:03:32.220]   process that i went through courtesy of these artists and activists out of
[00:03:32.220 --> 00:03:34.180]   germany called tactical tech
[00:03:34.180 --> 00:03:37.380]   that let's you kind of review your own exposure to data
[00:03:37.380 --> 00:03:40.620]   and so i did a personal journey and took notes in chronicled it
[00:03:40.620 --> 00:03:44.340]   and out of that experience which you know i've been processing for over a year
[00:03:44.340 --> 00:03:45.260]   honestly
[00:03:45.260 --> 00:03:47.460]   i wrote uh... humbly titled
[00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:51.940]   new tech manifesto yes on ways i think that we could collectively
[00:03:51.940 --> 00:03:56.500]   not just be afraid of what the president is but like right about a future my hope
[00:03:56.500 --> 00:03:57.980]   is that we don't feel
[00:03:57.980 --> 00:03:59.260]   uh... disarmed
[00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:03.260]   by all this or or to depressed by but that we actually feel inspired
[00:04:03.260 --> 00:04:06.420]   uh... we still early days of the internet in this whole network world
[00:04:06.420 --> 00:04:10.580]   and it doesn't have to be uh... advertising health scape where we are all
[00:04:10.580 --> 00:04:12.060]   in someone's dossier
[00:04:12.060 --> 00:04:15.740]   of us so encourage folks to check that out there to date dot com i think the
[00:04:15.740 --> 00:04:18.980]   timing is good i feel like we're making progress in that regard are we thanks to
[00:04:18.980 --> 00:04:20.780]   the g_p_r_ and
[00:04:20.780 --> 00:04:23.740]   the face book to back over watch in the face
[00:04:23.740 --> 00:04:28.420]   on the n_b_a_ playoffs there were three not one not to but three apology
[00:04:28.420 --> 00:04:33.180]   uh... commercials yes face book which has been running its for several months
[00:04:33.180 --> 00:04:35.380]   and i love face books because it said
[00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:37.780]   you know all the things you love about face book
[00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:39.380]   and then something happened
[00:04:39.380 --> 00:04:41.700]   as if they had nothing to do with it
[00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:44.740]   that knows that passive event that occurred they were the victims here
[00:04:44.740 --> 00:04:47.220]   that something happened fake news
[00:04:47.220 --> 00:04:51.180]   poor zucker brogue really we should all just privacy sympathy for him people
[00:04:51.180 --> 00:04:53.740]   lost their data just happened
[00:04:53.740 --> 00:04:56.940]   it was a pretty funny and then there's wells forgo they took a little more i
[00:04:56.940 --> 00:05:00.460]   think more the wells for god was the most annoying add to listen to but it was
[00:05:00.460 --> 00:05:04.620]   the most honest i think in admitting their own floss is a we lost your trust
[00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.860]   accurate i wish face book it said
[00:05:06.860 --> 00:05:08.860]   only law you know it
[00:05:08.860 --> 00:05:11.180]   that's the only kind of apology that works
[00:05:11.180 --> 00:05:14.620]   one of the things that one of my favorite honestly my favorite line from my
[00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:16.420]   little short series was
[00:05:16.420 --> 00:05:20.460]   you know face book has been not just on an apology tour but like a corrective
[00:05:20.460 --> 00:05:22.900]   blogging exercise where you go to
[00:05:22.900 --> 00:05:25.180]   newsroom dot f_b_ dot com
[00:05:25.180 --> 00:05:28.180]   which i encourage everyone to do because
[00:05:28.180 --> 00:05:29.340]   we probably have it
[00:05:29.340 --> 00:05:31.300]   they are launching all these new tools
[00:05:31.300 --> 00:05:34.020]   and they say we're gonna audit the app developers
[00:05:34.020 --> 00:05:36.900]   and we're gonna we're gonna get them we're gonna get them for abusing your
[00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:37.900]   data
[00:05:37.900 --> 00:05:41.300]   and it's like dudes it was like you open the door
[00:05:41.300 --> 00:05:45.060]   you left the keys in the lock you had signs up
[00:05:45.060 --> 00:05:47.540]   that said grab all this data while you can
[00:05:47.540 --> 00:05:48.860]   everything must go
[00:05:48.860 --> 00:05:50.780]   so you know face book
[00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.380]   you know auditing and investigating app developers is like walter white
[00:05:54.380 --> 00:05:56.420]   investigated jesse
[00:05:56.420 --> 00:06:01.020]   all that message as he made in walter's lab using his scientific knowledge
[00:06:01.020 --> 00:06:02.660]   and and until they
[00:06:02.660 --> 00:06:06.420]   not only apologize but like really come clean and acknowledge
[00:06:06.420 --> 00:06:09.820]   that it was part of their corporate growth strategy
[00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:13.100]   to let all these folks in and sell us all out
[00:06:13.100 --> 00:06:15.860]   it's going to be very hard to take them seriously when asked for a trust back
[00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:18.420]   i can even trust you to be honest about the problem
[00:06:18.420 --> 00:06:19.820]   you helped create
[00:06:19.820 --> 00:06:22.780]   but that would require a little bit of humility in the side of face book and i
[00:06:22.780 --> 00:06:25.700]   don't think that corporation is humility built into its d_n_a_
[00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.780]   i think it it goes right back to the business model i mean
[00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:34.580]   zuckerberg has been uh... playing fast and loose with his users data
[00:06:34.580 --> 00:06:38.460]   since he was in short pants in harvard and he keeps apologizing
[00:06:38.460 --> 00:06:43.260]   and it's always the same thing it's just he's he's dependent on his his
[00:06:43.260 --> 00:06:45.300]   business is dependent on the users
[00:06:45.300 --> 00:06:47.060]   sticking around
[00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:48.260]   watching ads
[00:06:48.260 --> 00:06:49.620]   and uh...
[00:06:49.620 --> 00:06:51.940]   whatever it you know if you can
[00:06:51.940 --> 00:06:56.180]   uh... prioritized user engagement then you're gonna uh...
[00:06:56.180 --> 00:06:57.700]   have things like
[00:06:57.700 --> 00:07:02.220]   the two thousand sixteen election did you see the the thing that uh...
[00:07:02.220 --> 00:07:04.340]   they did on uh...

[00:08:57.420 --> 00:09:01.820]   and once problematic for me to say this as a straight white cis male but check
[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:02.740]   your
[00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:07.340]   show this beautiful goddess some respect
[00:09:07.340 --> 00:09:08.900]   just through
[00:09:08.900 --> 00:09:12.140]   drinking something about the massaging
[00:09:12.140 --> 00:09:13.300]   absolutely
[00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:17.220]   we're doing everything we can to block people like that from coming in here
[00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:18.900]   and if we can't do that
[00:09:18.900 --> 00:09:21.340]   we don't deserve to serve you
[00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:23.500]   speaking of
[00:09:23.500 --> 00:09:26.980]   we can serve you
[00:09:26.980 --> 00:09:28.060]   and i was reading
[00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:30.740]   they don't even have a word for poverty
[00:09:30.740 --> 00:09:34.020]   after part i like what you had it
[00:09:34.020 --> 00:09:40.220]   seems so trust this fairly accurate why would this not happen if you like
[00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:45.140]   well that accent that would talk to you can't pretend that i have to get it in the
[00:09:45.140 --> 00:09:47.500]   world's matter
[00:09:47.500 --> 00:09:50.660]   all lives matter you both are
[00:09:50.660 --> 00:09:57.660]   i think you mean you are both wrong
[00:09:57.660 --> 00:10:00.580]   that's actually
[00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:02.660]   calls off and slugs
[00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:06.140]   and he's just collected money more beer more drinks
[00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.660]   the bar is cham
[00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:10.140]   the worst
[00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:11.700]   and everybody's fighting
[00:10:11.700 --> 00:10:14.660]   as with russian hats
[00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:18.460]   he said i'd like to pick up my kid but i thought that now
[00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:20.980]   what this place is doing to you
[00:10:20.980 --> 00:10:22.980]   toxic
[00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:23.980]   the right
[00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:30.980]   should we be
[00:10:30.980 --> 00:10:35.300]   as people listening but i think you can imagine
[00:10:35.300 --> 00:10:36.420]   what the video
[00:10:36.420 --> 00:10:39.860]   is pretty accurate audio
[00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:41.420]   well
[00:10:41.420 --> 00:10:45.820]   so the thing about real life is there's a natural damper on that kind of stuff
[00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:49.380]   right you don't want to confront somebody directly said there are people
[00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:51.260]   occasionally you'll be in a bar that
[00:10:51.260 --> 00:10:54.940]   you'll meet somebody like that but that but that they're shut down fairly quickly
[00:10:54.940 --> 00:10:58.820]   right right the bartender tries to keep things calm rather than instead of
[00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:00.460]   lighting a fire right
[00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:01.940]   right
[00:11:01.940 --> 00:11:04.340]   i feel like twitter is even worse
[00:11:04.340 --> 00:11:05.940]   i just want to say
[00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:09.340]   uh... facebook's getting a lot of heat but really if you want to go into a bar
[00:11:09.340 --> 00:11:10.580]   fight
[00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:13.100]   just say anything on twitter
[00:11:13.100 --> 00:11:16.140]   yeah but the argument of the face books data usage is pretty separate from the
[00:11:16.140 --> 00:11:19.660]   toxicity of the platform itself said that there is similar points but they are
[00:11:19.660 --> 00:11:21.020]   distinct
[00:11:21.020 --> 00:11:24.860]   because the idea that face book knows all these things about us and has been
[00:11:24.860 --> 00:11:27.020]   making money the whole time
[00:11:27.020 --> 00:11:30.340]   off of that deep knowledge that's a that is to alex's point more specific to
[00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:31.340]   facebook
[00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:32.700]   then twitter which
[00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:33.220]   is a
[00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:35.860]   uncontrolled space but not as deeply
[00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:39.060]   ingrained uh... in our psyche as face book yep
[00:11:39.060 --> 00:11:43.460]   i just don't maybe pictures i think twitter is a more subtly uh... i think
[00:11:43.460 --> 00:11:47.180]   actually twitter is causing a national psychosis
[00:11:47.180 --> 00:11:50.580]   so face book you're right about the you know surveillance capitalism and all
[00:11:50.580 --> 00:11:51.420]   of that
[00:11:51.420 --> 00:11:55.700]   but if you're just looking at the effects of a site
[00:11:55.700 --> 00:11:56.740]   on people
[00:11:56.740 --> 00:11:58.180]   uh...
[00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:01.820]   twitter seems to really turn even nice people
[00:12:01.820 --> 00:12:03.220]   and monsters
[00:12:03.220 --> 00:12:08.980]   and when i look at the numbers about uh... how ideas flowed
[00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:13.500]   uh... they may have started at twitter but the the impact was on facebook
[00:12:13.500 --> 00:12:15.700]   that's what it is that's much bigger
[00:12:15.700 --> 00:12:19.140]   right does not mean the people who are on twitter are us there's a lot of media
[00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:20.300]   people there
[00:12:20.300 --> 00:12:23.740]   uh... but relatively speak there's not billions you know twenty three hundred
[00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:26.580]   million is in the world's
[00:12:26.580 --> 00:12:30.140]   democracies or falling versions of those things
[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:35.020]   on a much deeper level right and you can sell ads uh... you can target
[00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:37.780]   content on face book in a way you can't
[00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:41.620]   do you think peritone either that this idea of detox is
[00:12:41.620 --> 00:12:43.900]   gonna go any farther than
[00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:45.460]   us
[00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:49.580]   uh... do you think general people the guy with the photo
[00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:51.140]   it's not gonna leave
[00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:53.540]   so so what i all
[00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:55.700]   try to consistently argue for
[00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:59.140]   i think it's it's a both and or yes and type strategy
[00:12:59.140 --> 00:13:01.740]   i don't think individual action alone
[00:13:01.740 --> 00:13:04.900]   is gonna fix all this stuff it's it's like just say no
[00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:08.100]   right yes just say no but also don't create an environment
[00:13:08.100 --> 00:13:11.100]   right where like drugs are the only outlet or selling them as the only
[00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:12.620]   economic opportunity
[00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:15.140]   and so that means we look at the systems
[00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:20.100]   so individual detoxing to some degree i think is really valuable educational
[00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:22.380]   first thing i look into the mall
[00:13:22.380 --> 00:13:26.980]   uh... the gaping maw of nonsense that we have like open ourselves up to
[00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:28.100]   and then
[00:13:28.100 --> 00:13:29.980]   we should put pressure on the companies
[00:13:29.980 --> 00:13:32.860]   pressure on our regulators in our oversight bodies get the research to
[00:13:32.860 --> 00:13:33.980]   place
[00:13:33.980 --> 00:13:37.460]   to give us the tools to better manage and the good news
[00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:40.220]   if you look at apples announcement last week if you look at google with
[00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:41.580]   android p
[00:13:41.580 --> 00:13:44.180]   they are starting to get the message certainly around
[00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:47.380]   the addictive stuff and the sort of mind hacking
[00:13:47.380 --> 00:13:48.860]   and i think soon
[00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:51.780]   around the data and and giving us tools
[00:13:51.780 --> 00:13:54.060]   to have transparency is individually
[00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:56.460]   it took me a lot of time
[00:13:56.460 --> 00:14:00.500]   to go to that process and i was able to recover some of that value
[00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:02.860]   by writing for money about it
[00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:06.180]   but that's my job it is not everybody's job
[00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:09.180]   to make a full-time out of tuning your privacy settings
[00:14:09.180 --> 00:14:11.620]   and reclaiming slices of your life
[00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:15.220]   from these massive multinational companies whose job it is to to sell us
[00:14:15.220 --> 00:14:18.460]   you read i had put off this portion of the data detox
[00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:20.780]   because i prioritize time with my girlfriend
[00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:24.060]   watching it lanta and living my life
[00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:27.620]   however it is an easy is it and in fact
[00:14:27.620 --> 00:14:31.020]   as you dig into in this case ever notes
[00:14:31.020 --> 00:14:34.260]   terms twenty nine thousand words
[00:14:34.260 --> 00:14:36.300]   uh... you found all sorts of stuff that
[00:14:36.300 --> 00:14:38.140]   wasn't quite as
[00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:41.060]   user-friendly is it looked like on the surface right
[00:14:41.060 --> 00:14:45.580]   no and i think what the simplest thing i asked for out of this and and
[00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:48.220]   everyone who's listening to know we're so early in the show
[00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:51.620]   i got a bunch of bitly links uh... but if you go to baritone dot com you'll find
[00:14:51.620 --> 00:14:52.620]   the whole set
[00:14:52.620 --> 00:14:56.540]   the most important is that i took the manifesto piece like my call
[00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:59.460]   to collective arms metaphorically speaking
[00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:01.860]   and i opened it up it's an open google doc
[00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:05.060]   and people can i said and continue to add to it
[00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:08.020]   so the most the thing that people attached the most to was i used an
[00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:09.740]   analogy to food
[00:15:09.740 --> 00:15:12.980]   preparation food service and and grocery sales
[00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:15.540]   and i said look we don't individually bring
[00:15:15.540 --> 00:15:16.900]   chemistry sets
[00:15:16.900 --> 00:15:18.460]   to the grocery store
[00:15:18.460 --> 00:15:22.100]   to analyze the contents of our food we don't have to because they've been
[00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:26.740]   over a minute and then nutrition labels and companies are going further you
[00:15:26.740 --> 00:15:29.380]   know whole foods is done this whole thing where you understand
[00:15:29.380 --> 00:15:31.820]   the sourcing and all of that
[00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:34.020]   we are in technology is
[00:15:34.020 --> 00:15:35.300]   designed
[00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:39.780]   to do batch processing is designed to make to surface information at scale
[00:15:39.780 --> 00:15:43.300]   so if there's one industry in the history of all industries
[00:15:43.300 --> 00:15:46.340]   that could inform us at scale more clearly
[00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:47.620]   it is technology
[00:15:47.620 --> 00:15:50.540]   so to apply that lens not to nutrition
[00:15:50.540 --> 00:15:53.660]   but to how our data is used i would love to not have to read thirty thousand
[00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:54.580]   dollars
[00:15:54.580 --> 00:15:57.100]   of a terms of service i'd love to be able to compare
[00:15:57.100 --> 00:15:58.380]   and contrast
[00:15:58.380 --> 00:15:59.660]   who's selling me out
[00:15:59.660 --> 00:16:02.660]   who's you know sucking in my friends address books
[00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:06.220]   who is stalking me across the web with invisible trackers
[00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:09.900]   and then you know the consent becomes informed right now
[00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:12.140]   we don't really have meaningful consent
[00:16:12.140 --> 00:16:14.260]   right we have compulsory consent
[00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:16.820]   which is a concern at all it's like hostage taking
[00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:18.900]   so that's an example
[00:16:18.900 --> 00:16:21.780]   uh... no one should have to read thirty thousand words
[00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:24.940]   for every app you interact with that is
[00:16:24.940 --> 00:16:29.900]   a lifetime work lifetime of work and we can do better this industry was designed
[00:16:29.900 --> 00:16:32.580]   on just making that sort of information
[00:16:32.580 --> 00:16:35.340]   accessible distillable and clear
[00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:37.620]   so i i try to be hopeful and say
[00:16:37.620 --> 00:16:40.700]   we can do this as opposed to all my god were screwed
[00:16:40.700 --> 00:16:44.100]   unplug from the matrix it's all over i i don't think so i don't want that i like
[00:16:44.100 --> 00:16:46.140]   the matrix it's beautiful
[00:16:46.140 --> 00:16:48.500]   hashtag manifest tunde
[00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:52.860]   manifest in the yeah i like the second point a lot in the manifest it ties in
[00:16:52.860 --> 00:16:56.420]   what you just said which is you know change data defaults from open to closed
[00:16:56.420 --> 00:16:59.620]   and so if you give people that you know you say ninety percent people will stick
[00:16:59.620 --> 00:17:00.660]   to defaults
[00:17:00.660 --> 00:17:03.900]   give them better privacy of front and people will have come up with a better
[00:17:03.900 --> 00:17:07.140]   incentive for for a surveillance capitalism company
[00:17:07.140 --> 00:17:10.700]   like facebook to do that that's that's just shooting themselves in the world
[00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:11.820]   they want me back
[00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:15.180]   because i've left face entirely now and so they don't want you back well not not
[00:17:15.180 --> 00:17:18.580]   me me but i think it more people joined
[00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:20.020]   everyday than quit
[00:17:20.020 --> 00:17:23.420]   over the last year but if you look at their earnings breakdown of their
[00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:26.420]   revenue per user per region going down
[00:17:26.420 --> 00:17:28.940]   uh... no but there's certain users that are much more valuable to their
[00:17:28.940 --> 00:17:32.740]   investors and so if they lose their mind share in certain markets at the u_s_
[00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:36.100]   where they're seen a declining teen usage which was very poorly for their
[00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:37.620]   aggregate with american usage
[00:17:37.620 --> 00:17:41.460]   those users montas a much higher rate of the average as work so they care a lot
[00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:42.220]   more about
[00:17:42.220 --> 00:17:46.900]   not just number but also which users they are and so if we the united states log
[00:17:46.900 --> 00:17:47.580]   off
[00:17:47.580 --> 00:17:49.700]   we know about this we don't like it
[00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:53.220]   that harms their earnings more than just using losing any kind of one user on
[00:17:53.220 --> 00:17:53.700]   the world
[00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:54.820]   people are to say something
[00:17:54.820 --> 00:17:58.900]   well i i we read your manifesto on the on the ferry over here
[00:17:58.900 --> 00:17:59.980]   all
[00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:01.700]   was designed
[00:18:01.700 --> 00:18:04.500]   or boat based reading so much
[00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:06.860]   can you know what the number five
[00:18:06.860 --> 00:18:08.340]   yeah we can pull that up for you
[00:18:08.340 --> 00:18:09.500]   um...
[00:18:09.500 --> 00:18:14.300]   'cause it really gets down to seem to me uh... you want some new laws you want
[00:18:14.300 --> 00:18:16.980]   government regulation is that the right thing to do
[00:18:16.980 --> 00:18:18.660]   i'm just asking this what
[00:18:18.660 --> 00:18:20.060]   what
[00:18:20.060 --> 00:18:22.860]   what are you looking for what are the laws that you think
[00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:24.940]   other be passed in
[00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:26.860]   in what priority
[00:18:26.860 --> 00:18:31.180]   yeah i don't have a complete answer to that i'll be very straight up
[00:18:31.180 --> 00:18:33.860]   approach that call for regulation
[00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:36.540]   in the same way that i think we've approached
[00:18:36.540 --> 00:18:40.780]   other elements of life that have been regulated whether it's highway safety
[00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:43.100]   food safety child labor
[00:18:43.100 --> 00:18:47.660]   i think and the call for this manifesto came out of the idea
[00:18:47.660 --> 00:18:51.740]   individual action is not enough you look at climate change
[00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:54.060]   right we can't paper bag our way
[00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:55.980]   out of burning our planet down
[00:18:55.980 --> 00:18:57.020]   and so
[00:18:57.020 --> 00:18:58.980]   call we have a facility
[00:18:58.980 --> 00:19:00.540]   for collective action
[00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:01.620]   is called government
[00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:03.420]   in democracies for sure
[00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:07.540]   and if we've reclaimed at an exercise our power through that
[00:19:07.540 --> 00:19:09.460]   we have to redesign some elements of it
[00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:10.740]   but it is one of our
[00:19:10.740 --> 00:19:14.740]   most effective despite all the rhetoric about dysfunction
[00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:17.260]   ways of exercising collective power
[00:19:17.260 --> 00:19:20.900]   so i it's not that i have a list of the top twenty laws and here's the
[00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:22.660]   subject sections and all
[00:19:22.660 --> 00:19:25.380]   but i think print the principles
[00:19:25.380 --> 00:19:25.860]   of
[00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:30.020]   managing and using the government to exert influence where we individuals
[00:19:30.020 --> 00:19:31.340]   don't have power
[00:19:31.340 --> 00:19:32.660]   feel sound to me
[00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:34.540]   and they may include
[00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:35.660]   things like
[00:19:35.660 --> 00:19:37.300]   ownership of our data
[00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:40.780]   g_d_p_r_ is the right is the right direction who knows exactly how that's
[00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:42.620]   going to play out its way to early
[00:19:42.620 --> 00:19:44.820]   but at least europe is trying
[00:19:44.820 --> 00:19:46.060]   in the u_s_
[00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:50.340]   we're just like all you want to rob people go forth and and do that
[00:19:50.340 --> 00:19:54.260]   and that's not what we do in the u_s_ we like market-based solutions we have a
[00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:57.740]   kind of fetishism about the market and that's what you're suggesting alex
[00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:59.500]   right with that be sufficient
[00:19:59.500 --> 00:20:04.140]   uh... i think we all agreed that the market itself is never enough because in
[00:20:04.140 --> 00:20:06.300]   a fully market-based capital society
[00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:09.300]   the poor people get ground to a faint dust and the rich people the very top
[00:20:09.300 --> 00:20:11.220]   do very well so some regulations
[00:20:11.220 --> 00:20:12.580]   are critical now
[00:20:12.580 --> 00:20:13.540]   i
[00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:17.500]   don't think about social media legislation much and i don't think any of us did
[00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.060]   before two thousand sixteen
[00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:22.020]   uh... so i don't like like berry and i don't have exactly the list of things
[00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:23.460]   that i would change but certainly
[00:20:23.460 --> 00:20:25.020]   if we had some rules
[00:20:25.020 --> 00:20:26.140]   maybe even
[00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:27.620]   reminiscent of g_d_p_r_
[00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:29.740]   that would be a good place to start because we can't
[00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:31.620]   just do nothing
[00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:34.020]   i don't think that the healthy for our nation long-term
[00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:37.460]   well you know number two for example change that it defaults from open to
[00:20:37.460 --> 00:20:41.260]   close right that's a simple rule of that and the government could enforce that
[00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:44.340]   the downside of those what counts as open what counts as close what counts as a
[00:20:44.340 --> 00:20:47.700]   default we're gonna end up having that battle back and forth in congress as we
[00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:50.980]   saw during this record hearings is not well read on the stuff
[00:20:50.980 --> 00:20:55.140]   so to to kind of fully execute what we think we need to say the least to say
[00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:57.860]   i was shooting for a new statement for once
[00:20:57.860 --> 00:21:01.220]   once i was trying to be british i admit i was having some times
[00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:04.740]   uh... but maybe we can elect a younger uh... group to congress and we talk about
[00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:06.140]   something for sure a little bit
[00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:08.940]   uh... we can actually make some progress here because we can't just let
[00:21:08.940 --> 00:21:11.660]   mark zuckerberg who was voting for a face book
[00:21:11.660 --> 00:21:14.940]   decide for two point two billion monthly actors or whatever it is
[00:21:14.940 --> 00:21:18.780]   what's gonna happen with their privacy their data their life and their children
[00:21:18.780 --> 00:21:22.180]   like that's that's too much power in one hand a quote on a too much
[00:21:22.180 --> 00:21:23.220]   on africa lyric
[00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:27.060]   although on that's our we've all forgotten a lot of things can you see that
[00:21:27.060 --> 00:21:30.340]   thank you for saving me but but i would say it in a rare
[00:21:30.340 --> 00:21:34.500]   and a rare super unpatriotic moment like i would welcome some british oversight
[00:21:34.500 --> 00:21:37.380]   back in the u_s_ you know what you don't want given
[00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:40.820]   you know if you looked at the questions that the british subcommittee on
[00:21:40.820 --> 00:21:43.740]   commerce sport and i forgot the full title
[00:21:43.740 --> 00:21:46.580]   like the way they questioned facebook c_t_o_
[00:21:46.580 --> 00:21:49.340]   versus the way our senators questions uckerberg
[00:21:49.340 --> 00:21:50.660]   is clear
[00:21:50.660 --> 00:21:53.460]   they care more like they've done their homework more
[00:21:53.460 --> 00:21:57.060]   and on this point they were better representatives of humanity
[00:21:57.060 --> 00:22:01.340]   then the u_s_ senate one and yet i mean the u_k_ is famous for citizens
[00:22:01.340 --> 00:22:02.300]   surveillance
[00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:05.900]   their famous for you know i think maybe one of the things that's going on there
[00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:07.900]   is that they trust the government
[00:22:07.900 --> 00:22:11.780]   to surveil and they don't trust private industry surveil were quite the opposite
[00:22:11.780 --> 00:22:15.540]   here in the u_s_ excellent we we are in favor of like if you're going to
[00:22:15.540 --> 00:22:16.860]   still for money
[00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:20.100]   go forth like that we're all about i think the state's thing is
[00:22:20.100 --> 00:22:21.540]   profitable
[00:22:21.540 --> 00:22:24.980]   do it yet but that is the american frankly i'm much more afraid of a government
[00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:27.540]   surveillance than i am facebook doesn't have
[00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:30.900]   but we have no we're wearing america as we learned through the snowed in era we
[00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:34.100]   learned that the u_s_ government does have worse in the u_k_ i agree that it's
[00:22:34.100 --> 00:22:36.260]   worse in the u_k_ but it's also bad here
[00:22:36.260 --> 00:22:40.500]   so i don't give us a pass on the government side of this question
[00:22:40.500 --> 00:22:43.820]   but this is a lot of the before that's better in the short term
[00:22:43.820 --> 00:22:45.740]   well in the idea that
[00:22:45.740 --> 00:22:49.660]   i mean everybody can be evil right governments and corporations
[00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:53.340]   given how much in the u_s_ we've outsourced to corporations
[00:22:53.340 --> 00:22:58.340]   it's not a clean line anymore yeah uh... you know we we find our love and our
[00:22:58.340 --> 00:23:00.180]   jobs and so much
[00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:01.700]   through these platforms
[00:23:01.700 --> 00:23:06.100]   and so it's not a nuclear weapon but as came for general it has shown
[00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:10.180]   would there is a weaponization possible of these platforms not a pleasant has
[00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:11.180]   real heart
[00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:13.780]   right and so you know if you look like russia
[00:23:13.780 --> 00:23:18.100]   is very excited about the chaos that's been caused
[00:23:18.100 --> 00:23:21.620]   and they didn't have to technically fire a shot right it wasn't a ballistic
[00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:23.260]   missile
[00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:26.340]   have make no mistake like this was an attack
[00:23:26.340 --> 00:23:28.820]   and we are suffering and paying the price of it
[00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:32.700]   in trade deals gone awry in war with frickin canada like
[00:23:32.700 --> 00:23:34.980]   why are you picking up fight with canada seriously
[00:23:34.980 --> 00:23:37.380]   but that's how tough you are you pick a fight
[00:23:37.380 --> 00:23:39.540]   canada they're like the nicest
[00:23:39.540 --> 00:23:42.780]   people so i i just think uh... we have to be careful that
[00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:44.180]   even though it doesn't look like a
[00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:45.340]   a hard weapon
[00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:47.260]   the soft weapons can do dishes must damage
[00:23:47.260 --> 00:23:50.060]   well that's a good right and then what we can look at what apple and you
[00:23:50.060 --> 00:23:53.700]   mentioned uh... and read to you at what apple and google are both doing
[00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:56.780]   i think probably because of market forces saying
[00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:59.820]   you better take care of this because the risk is if you don't
[00:23:59.820 --> 00:24:02.980]   uh... somebody else may be a little bit well
[00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:06.540]   uh... but i think companies are paying attention maybe not face book maybe not
[00:24:06.540 --> 00:24:10.300]   twitter but maybe apple let's talk about what apple announced and just a second
[00:24:10.300 --> 00:24:12.860]   at the w_w_d_c_ earlier
[00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:14.940]   uh... this week i mentioned that there
[00:24:14.940 --> 00:24:17.620]   the uh... the uh... n_b_a_ files had apologies
[00:24:17.620 --> 00:24:20.820]   i had there were three of them i didn't mention the third one which is uber
[00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:24.140]   and i have to say i'm really impressed uber is uh...
[00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:27.660]   uh... spending some money to tell people that they are moving forward
[00:24:27.660 --> 00:24:28.940]   and i am
[00:24:28.940 --> 00:24:32.220]   a big uber family you guys use to bear i use uber
[00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:34.900]   i never actually did delete uber
[00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:39.180]   but i want uber i want to do it in to acknowledge the issues and and do
[00:24:39.180 --> 00:24:41.060]   something about it and they are
[00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:45.300]   they're working on how to keep us better protected how to keep us better connected
[00:24:45.300 --> 00:24:48.540]   during a trip they created a safety center where you can learn about driver
[00:24:48.540 --> 00:24:50.940]   screening community guidelines
[00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:54.500]   to ensure everybody's uh... moving safely
[00:24:54.500 --> 00:24:57.660]   you can now this is really interesting i have used the uber app in a while but
[00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:00.980]   uh... couple of weeks i think that you can designate up to five family members
[00:25:00.980 --> 00:25:01.980]   and friends
[00:25:01.980 --> 00:25:04.820]   as trusted contacts did you see that in the app
[00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:08.580]   set up reminders to share your trip details with them whenever you ride
[00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:11.140]   so they can see you on the map and no one you've arrived
[00:25:11.140 --> 00:25:12.460]   my daughter
[00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:16.900]   i college age daughter had her third and final car crash this week in her
[00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:17.660]   self
[00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:20.420]   but she's total the car and said hey good news
[00:25:20.420 --> 00:25:23.300]   it's actually cheaper for you to take uber everywhere
[00:25:23.300 --> 00:25:24.220]   and now
[00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:27.420]   you know if you'll safe having her do that so i think that's a really good thing
[00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:28.580]   and i will have her
[00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:31.860]   set me up as a trusted contact so i know where she is now she's arrived
[00:25:31.860 --> 00:25:34.580]   my mom uses uber in red island to she's eighty five
[00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:36.260]   she hasn't had a car in some time
[00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:39.540]   mobility's been an issue for her to go to my sister every time she wants to go to
[00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:42.460]   the store or the doctor has been a real problem
[00:25:42.460 --> 00:25:44.020]   i'm gonna have a call lies as soon
[00:25:44.020 --> 00:25:47.220]   but no she's now i set up with uber put the credit card in
[00:25:47.220 --> 00:25:47.980]   she
[00:25:47.980 --> 00:25:49.100]   loves it
[00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:52.340]   and ubers updated the app to make it easy for you to verify the details of your
[00:25:52.340 --> 00:25:54.260]   ride you'll see your driver's name
[00:25:54.260 --> 00:25:55.740]   car license
[00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:58.340]   you can make sure to get the right car the right ride
[00:25:58.340 --> 00:25:59.580]   every time
[00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:03.580]   i think ubers i want uber to succeed i want uber to solve these problems and
[00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:05.500]   move forward i think they're doing
[00:26:05.500 --> 00:26:09.180]   exactly that you can find out more at uber dot com
[00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:11.260]   slash moving forward
[00:26:11.260 --> 00:26:14.500]   uh... i think this is an important trust initiative and as a fan and the
[00:26:14.500 --> 00:26:15.900]   user uh...
[00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:19.820]   i'm really glad to see uh... what the dark or so shani is doing and
[00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:21.980]   how they're moving forward
[00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:25.820]   uh... to re-earn our trust uber dot com slash
[00:26:25.820 --> 00:26:27.580]   moving forward
[00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:34.020]   apple w_w_d_c_ monday you were there philip elmer to win yes yes i was
[00:26:34.020 --> 00:26:36.660]   and i think first time seeing the uh...
[00:26:36.660 --> 00:26:38.740]   or you didn't go to the campus this is a mccainry
[00:26:38.740 --> 00:26:41.580]   right at that this is a sense that i have been to the camp did they have a
[00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:42.100]   night
[00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:45.740]   uh... before the day before they had an event there where people could go and
[00:26:45.740 --> 00:26:47.860]   gee i don't know i didn't get invited
[00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:51.380]   shoot i think it might be any of it so you're ahead of me believe me
[00:26:51.380 --> 00:26:52.740]   uh...
[00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:56.340]   so you want to talk about the impressions first impressions
[00:26:56.340 --> 00:27:00.220]   i thought it was uh... a pretty disorganized
[00:27:00.220 --> 00:27:01.100]   show
[00:27:01.100 --> 00:27:02.580]   um...
[00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:05.020]   uh... as an editor i thought it had the
[00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:06.340]   pro the
[00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:08.780]   flaws of a feature story
[00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:12.180]   with two competing structures going on
[00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:14.220]   but one you know it was structured
[00:27:14.220 --> 00:27:17.340]   okay here the four operating systems are going to update them yeah that seems
[00:27:17.340 --> 00:27:20.180]   like a sense especially once they acknowledge no hardware
[00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:24.100]   right that's but but that's not go as to be a lesson watch a lesson i was but
[00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:27.300]   it was totally uneven because they would wait more to say about i was in
[00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:30.260]   maco and head of the tv o_s_ was a throw away
[00:27:30.260 --> 00:27:32.980]   and then it was also for two audiences the
[00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:37.060]   developers and the users but they've historically had that problem at the
[00:27:37.060 --> 00:27:38.020]   b_d_ site
[00:27:38.020 --> 00:27:41.620]   and for my sense of it was that for the developers
[00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:45.180]   it was the setup not the punchline
[00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:48.100]   they were giving them a lot of tools that we're not going to see the results of
[00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:51.420]   for months or years right uh... for the
[00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:52.500]   the maxed up
[00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:56.100]   uh... for the users there was a lot of punchline there are a lot of little
[00:27:56.100 --> 00:27:58.740]   improvements from how you control
[00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:03.740]   notifications to uh... you know the stuff that you wanted to get into which is
[00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:08.460]   monitoring your abusive your addictive behavior look at that i let me just say
[00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:11.060]   the two things and i'll get out of the way because that
[00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:15.140]   there's to me there were two takeaways that i thought were very interesting
[00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:16.460]   one
[00:28:16.460 --> 00:28:19.940]   the fact that they've put effort into the finder in the maco s
[00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:24.100]   i found very encouraging i was really worried that apple had just given up on
[00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:27.340]   mac and talk and i'm not convinced that they haven't
[00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:29.580]   but at least they've got somebody
[00:28:29.580 --> 00:28:31.140]   spending some energy
[00:28:31.140 --> 00:28:35.140]   putting effort into a a finder which is the main thing you use a maco s which
[00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:37.540]   hasn't been changed in years
[00:28:37.540 --> 00:28:40.340]   uh... they actually put some effort into the finder i thought that was very
[00:28:40.340 --> 00:28:44.540]   encouraging and they did something that is in some ways
[00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:46.420]   been a pipe dream
[00:28:46.420 --> 00:28:50.020]   for computer scientists since the earliest days of personal computing
[00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:52.980]   and i know philip you'll remember this you young guys won't
[00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:55.620]   document centric computing
[00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:59.540]   and the idea is right now and we're just used to it's always been this way you
[00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:01.660]   want to do something you launch an app
[00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:05.460]   the app does whatever it is you want to do on the data on the document it's
[00:29:05.460 --> 00:29:07.140]   apps and documents
[00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:11.060]   but but even going back to alan k in the dino book in the very first vision
[00:29:11.060 --> 00:29:13.380]   that started the mac and touch it apple
[00:29:13.380 --> 00:29:15.780]   uh... wasn't alan k it was uh...
[00:29:15.780 --> 00:29:16.220]   uh...
[00:29:16.220 --> 00:29:21.180]   i've got his name so the musky yeah no not the mouse guy anyway i'll his name
[00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:23.100]   will come to me in a second the chatterem will tell me
[00:29:23.100 --> 00:29:26.100]   but uh... the earliest days with the dina book
[00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:30.180]   the idea was or you don't why watch lunch apps that's very modal
[00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:33.100]   you're now in the word processing mode you're in the
[00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:36.820]   which should you just work on documents and whatever capabilities you need to
[00:29:36.820 --> 00:29:38.300]   be available to you
[00:29:38.300 --> 00:29:39.620]   in that document
[00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:42.780]   and it doesn't mean that apps don't exist you and we're seeing the technology
[00:29:42.780 --> 00:29:45.100]   now here even on on a smartphone
[00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:47.060]   where you've got the app
[00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:48.700]   that capability can be
[00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:51.740]   present front and center in the operating system
[00:29:51.740 --> 00:29:55.020]   and so they showed with finder editing photos
[00:29:55.020 --> 00:29:57.420]   uh... putting a signature in a p_d_f_
[00:29:57.420 --> 00:30:00.860]   i mean some really some really interesting things that don't require you to
[00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:02.300]   launch an app first
[00:30:02.300 --> 00:30:05.780]   and i hope that apple is sincere about working on finder
[00:30:05.780 --> 00:30:08.540]   and i hope that this is is a direction that they're going to take
[00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:10.820]   because this is the future this could be
[00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:12.820]   a really interesting future for
[00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:17.740]   now i think they've made up a blunder raskin was the name of the
[00:30:17.740 --> 00:30:21.100]   i think they made a blunder uh...
[00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:24.460]   whoever had the idea that the max should be more like
[00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:25.940]   an ipod
[00:30:25.940 --> 00:30:31.260]   or an ipad rather well it was that was my other my second
[00:30:31.260 --> 00:30:36.340]   you know you know i were both about them i i live on a macbook air and they
[00:30:36.340 --> 00:30:39.900]   haven't made one to replace it that they've they've taken away my magnetic
[00:30:39.900 --> 00:30:42.780]   thing they put all the plugs that don't work
[00:30:42.780 --> 00:30:44.500]   and um...
[00:30:44.500 --> 00:30:49.020]   i thought this is to me the two tracks was apple givith and take it away
[00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:51.620]   you know correct it is up there and says
[00:30:51.620 --> 00:30:55.540]   no we're not merging i_o_s_ and macintosh big fat no boom yeah but then he says
[00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:58.200]   that's the very next thing they announced is and by the way you could put
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:31:00.300]   your i_o_s_ apps on mac
[00:31:00.300 --> 00:31:03.500]   which is exactly the thing that will kill the macintosh
[00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:07.460]   well turn it into i_o_s_ well they've you know
[00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:10.020]   that would that would kill it but uh...
[00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:14.660]   they showed i think with the four apps that they that they put on it that those
[00:31:14.660 --> 00:31:18.500]   that stocks and uh... whatever the other well everybody's been holding their
[00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:21.900]   breath till the stocks have made it to the back of the day anyway i know it's
[00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:24.580]   exciting yours so excited stocks
[00:31:24.580 --> 00:31:27.380]   uh...
[00:31:27.380 --> 00:31:28.620]   and measuring
[00:31:28.620 --> 00:31:32.740]   we can measure wait i have i think that's about both of the things
[00:31:32.740 --> 00:31:37.580]   that that measurement thing was was brutal because when they came out with
[00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:40.620]   with the augmented reality with the a_r_ kit
[00:31:40.620 --> 00:31:42.340]   there were there weren't very many
[00:31:42.340 --> 00:31:43.980]   this is what ended up being
[00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:47.460]   the at the room in usable after came out in the only one that i like that i
[00:31:47.460 --> 00:31:50.140]   bought was a measurement app and i sure are all
[00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:51.180]   sure are tomorrow
[00:31:51.180 --> 00:31:53.220]   and and just without apology
[00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:57.060]   look what we've discovered you can measure and by the way not very
[00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:00.420]   accurately according to people in use of the data
[00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:03.540]   but you know there are dozens of people in the audience and oh my god he just
[00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:07.500]   killed my app so i want to talk about that that the in-room reaction to that
[00:32:07.500 --> 00:32:09.940]   sort of announcement i watched the live stream i wasn't there in person but
[00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:12.780]   like it's felt like there's a lot of moments they would pause for applause
[00:32:12.780 --> 00:32:15.380]   and then no one will clap and then the employees in the room would start the
[00:32:15.380 --> 00:32:18.620]   applause track and maybe the generalist are not supposed to fill up with
[00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:21.420]   correct me journalists are supposed to sit on the you don't clap at events but
[00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:24.980]   anyways there will be so they that's why they put these clacks of apple
[00:32:24.980 --> 00:32:29.740]   employees in the front rows so that you hear cheers but it feels so artificial
[00:32:29.740 --> 00:32:32.740]   it doesn't come across well it's always been that look but it felt really bad
[00:32:32.740 --> 00:32:37.460]   this time it felt like the the big bang theory soundtrack inside a w_d_c_
[00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:41.260]   you can maybe want to clap my eyes out in the room you can really tell when
[00:32:41.260 --> 00:32:45.100]   it's just the apple employees clapping or when when it's the room when when dark
[00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:49.020]   mode was introduced they're all happy that dark everyone's well first of all
[00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:54.220]   i mean i wrote a book on how to be black dark mode maybe very excited it's
[00:32:54.220 --> 00:32:58.540]   really more than i had to be 30% great but okay that's fine it's getting closer
[00:32:58.540 --> 00:33:02.860]   apples because in my visual language and i would accept it actually i think dark
[00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:07.580]   mode is a big improvement it's kind of ironic because every operating system
[00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:12.780]   except macOS has always had theming all right and also talk about surface changes
[00:33:12.780 --> 00:33:17.620]   i mean yeah that was one bit yeah right on the other hand paul tharratt who you
[00:33:17.620 --> 00:33:23.100]   don't expect to say nice things about mac much said he grudgingly said you know
[00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:26.780]   what they did it right it really looks good you we've got dark modes in windows
[00:33:26.780 --> 00:33:30.460]   for instance and there's always an app that doesn't do it right or there's a
[00:33:30.460 --> 00:33:35.420]   no title bar that's ugly he said apple has really done it right in a way that it
[00:33:35.420 --> 00:33:38.860]   really is aesthetically pleasing and he's a designer and paul's hard to please
[00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:42.380]   like he's great great guy but yeah he's essentially grump with two legs and i
[00:33:42.380 --> 00:33:45.740]   love him it's also the cheapest way to get a new computer
[00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:50.140]   yeah it's just to change the way your existing computer looks it's fan oh wow
[00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:53.180]   it's oldly new operating system awesome thank you
[00:33:53.180 --> 00:33:57.500]   then so the so can i can i talk about parental controls
[00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:01.580]   yeah well all right so with that now i said my piece let's talk about in general
[00:34:01.580 --> 00:34:06.220]   the whole health and well-being yeah part of this well so if you weren't there
[00:34:06.220 --> 00:34:09.500]   if you haven't heard about it they've offered a way to look at your what
[00:34:09.500 --> 00:34:13.420]   what you're doing with your your ios in a very granular way how much time you
[00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:17.740]   spend an individual apps when you're looking at them
[00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:21.580]   fine and i think there will be adults who will use this
[00:34:21.580 --> 00:34:26.620]   and uh for you know i say okay wait let's see in a year how many people are
[00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:30.300]   doing it it's kind of like counting your calories you can even set a limit on how
[00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:33.340]   like you've instagram you you said you only wanted to use it two hours today
[00:34:33.340 --> 00:34:37.660]   you're almost there you can bypass it but they but they were not offered us a
[00:34:37.660 --> 00:34:40.940]   lot of ways to control our experiences with Facebook owned
[00:34:40.940 --> 00:34:43.580]   companies i think it's great that was the other thing
[00:34:43.580 --> 00:34:48.060]   every all of the digs were facebook and google mostly facebook but facebook and
[00:34:48.060 --> 00:34:50.780]   google is like you want to control how much you've used
[00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:54.860]   facebook we can do it sorry philip was going to give us a
[00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:59.020]   well i just maybe it's because i grew up in a family that had a lot of
[00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:03.340]   controls and a lot of rules and a lot of grounding
[00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:07.340]   i just see this from the kids point of view and you know to get the parents now
[00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:11.580]   have a way to look into their kids devices and see
[00:35:11.580 --> 00:35:15.180]   exactly which apps they're using how long they're using it
[00:35:15.180 --> 00:35:19.100]   how much time they spend after bedtime looking at these things
[00:35:19.100 --> 00:35:23.020]   and i think this is horrible they've just they there was a lot of talk about
[00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:25.900]   empowering people well they just empowered the man
[00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:30.540]   and it's oh you're such a happy no i i'm in love with this
[00:35:30.540 --> 00:35:33.740]   kids and rights to and the kids i think it's gonna take
[00:35:33.740 --> 00:35:37.580]   you to the kids and you know it's not quite as bad
[00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:43.660]   as nixon's marijuana laws but but i think we're gonna look back at this time
[00:35:43.660 --> 00:35:48.700]   and say this is when you know a wall got put between the parents and the kids
[00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:53.500]   your kids did not grow up in the era where they had a mobile device they
[00:35:53.500 --> 00:35:57.100]   could take to bed with a digital crack rock and that digital crack
[00:35:57.100 --> 00:36:00.300]   rock for fighting and my kids didn't either but i have a
[00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:05.420]   15 year old now lisa's son my stepson and if we don't turn off the internet at
[00:36:05.420 --> 00:36:11.100]   10 p.m. he will not sleep all night because he will be on his i-pad
[00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:15.100]   and it's eight in the morning when we go to get him up for school
[00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:20.540]   he'll say but i haven't slept yet i mean and i i see this in in line with
[00:36:20.540 --> 00:36:23.580]   advertising controls on what you can say to young people
[00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:25.900]   right we know that the brains of young people
[00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:29.420]   aren't fully developed until we're like 70 80 years old right we just don't know
[00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:34.460]   anything until then and sophisticated psychological manipulation on kids
[00:36:34.460 --> 00:36:38.540]   to want sugary cereals to smoke cigarettes to do this and that
[00:36:38.540 --> 00:36:43.020]   that is not a fair fight between a parent and a massive multinational
[00:36:43.020 --> 00:36:46.940]   corporation with all of science and all of capital at its back
[00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:50.460]   and so i see this as restoring some balance i don't have children but i have
[00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:55.820]   friends who do my former high school just decided to like shut down
[00:36:55.820 --> 00:36:59.740]   a lot of wifi access because kids are coming to school and just
[00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:02.300]   watching television because they're streaming youtube
[00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:06.300]   they're they're having you know parties with Spotify and that's not the point
[00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:10.620]   of being in school all day is just to jam out to some hot tunes
[00:37:10.620 --> 00:37:14.540]   no that's the point of college yeah that's where you pay money for that later
[00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:17.740]   and so i don't i can't speak to this directly from a
[00:37:17.740 --> 00:37:21.580]   parent perspective but i just think we know the science and the manipulation
[00:37:21.580 --> 00:37:24.460]   that has gone into making these apps as addictive as possible
[00:37:24.460 --> 00:37:28.860]   and when we think of these supercomputers not as tools but as cigarettes
[00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:33.980]   as drugs as sugar parents have no possible opportunity
[00:37:33.980 --> 00:37:37.980]   to help their children resist those urges it is not a fair fight and i see
[00:37:37.980 --> 00:37:42.780]   apple and google trying to restore some power back to us i do think it's
[00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:46.460]   empowering to let us have our parents don't have to do it
[00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:50.060]   you don't have to do it i i understand what you're saying Philip we don't we
[00:37:50.060 --> 00:37:55.580]   don't want a police state in our house and and uh... but i always i always say
[00:37:55.580 --> 00:37:58.780]   to parents look i'm not going to judge how you raise your kids because you have
[00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:01.820]   your own challenges i'm definitely judging by the way but i'm in a judge
[00:38:01.820 --> 00:38:04.860]   no no but at the same time
[00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:07.660]   it's important parents understand kids need a place where they can express
[00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:10.300]   themselves without somebody looking over their shoulder
[00:38:10.300 --> 00:38:13.580]   they do need a certain amount of freedom but at the same time if you have a kid
[00:38:13.580 --> 00:38:17.980]   who's getting in trouble whether it's using crack rocks or digital crack rocks
[00:38:17.980 --> 00:38:23.100]   it's nice to have some tools so there's a i'm i'm not completely against that
[00:38:23.100 --> 00:38:25.420]   i think you i understand what you're saying and you don't want a police
[00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:30.620]   state in the house yeah i mean if if this leads to genuine conversations and
[00:38:30.620 --> 00:38:35.580]   that's what you need real parenting i'm for it but um there's not a lot of real
[00:38:35.580 --> 00:38:38.860]   parenting i i can just see a lot of families getting
[00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:42.460]   torn apart when you know imagine when the kids 13 and
[00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:46.300]   starts watching porn and his parents are monitoring how much porn he's watching
[00:38:46.300 --> 00:38:49.820]   after the lights turned off how jimmy you've exceeded the three hours we
[00:38:49.820 --> 00:38:53.420]   allotted you on porno hold on hold on does how granular does it
[00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:57.260]   get does it tell you which is no so far no i has websites too
[00:38:57.260 --> 00:39:00.700]   it has websites too it says it will tell you which pages
[00:39:00.700 --> 00:39:04.940]   sorry i brand tend to go for it no no i i'm just i may shift over to philip it
[00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:08.060]   because down to specific web page monitoring i thought this was about
[00:39:08.060 --> 00:39:11.740]   app time yeah i may be mistaken but i i think jason snell told me that there
[00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:14.780]   are websites is also included because then you could tell if your kid hadn't
[00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:17.500]   come out yet based on what they were watching and i don't think that's
[00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:19.740]   something that your phone should be disclosing to your parents for you what
[00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:23.340]   if you're a family of that's something for facebook to disclose in
[00:39:23.340 --> 00:39:28.380]   an ad but let me ask you this um none of you have small children so
[00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:33.500]   a title three hours on porno if you had kids under 12
[00:39:33.500 --> 00:39:38.460]   would you require their passcode to unlock the phone
[00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:41.180]   or would you say no you can you could do anything you want i don't want to see
[00:39:41.180 --> 00:39:44.380]   it i'm not trying to give them a phone well you're gonna first of all you're
[00:39:44.380 --> 00:39:46.940]   gonna have to get i have the password i have the password you have to have the
[00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:49.900]   password right hitting do you know the horrible
[00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:52.860]   like i i'm gonna keep this as tight as possible
[00:39:52.860 --> 00:39:56.940]   there are nefarious bad people out there
[00:39:56.940 --> 00:40:00.460]   trying to hack our kids minds there are white supremacists trying to recruit
[00:40:00.460 --> 00:40:04.140]   folks there are violent folks trying to get access to our kids they're people
[00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:07.580]   who just using the algorithm to hack their attention so they can make
[00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:10.380]   money that's really the problem look at youtube look at the youtube
[00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:14.220]   recommendations right and it's like i literally saw a video for kids that was
[00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:17.820]   like hitler in a bikini dancing next to a burning car
[00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:20.700]   and i'm pretty sure that psychologically damaging for me
[00:40:20.700 --> 00:40:24.620]   much less for a 10 year old so no there's no way some kid who's 10
[00:40:24.620 --> 00:40:28.380]   and is in my stewardship what age just have access to a super computer with
[00:40:28.380 --> 00:40:32.220]   no supervision what age do you say to your kid
[00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:40.220]   uh okay 35 35 not 18 18 maybe but 17
[00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:43.820]   i mean at least 18 right i mean like this
[00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:46.860]   you know it's really interesting baritone day for a long time there was
[00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:50.140]   this stranger danger thing this epidemic and and
[00:40:50.140 --> 00:40:53.260]   and you know the national center for missing and exploited kids was focusing
[00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:55.820]   on stranger danger and it turned out that most kids
[00:40:55.820 --> 00:41:00.540]   were abused and or abducted by people they knew mostly relatives family
[00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:04.140]   members it wasn't really any stranger danger it's one of the reasons we don't
[00:41:04.140 --> 00:41:07.020]   have like kids out on the street anymore they have to stay at home
[00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:10.140]   all time now you've got the new nazi stranger danger
[00:41:10.140 --> 00:41:14.380]   you've got white supremacists yeah but they're real they actually is that
[00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:20.140]   really is it a genuine threat yeah i i think you know if you look at
[00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:22.860]   the way isis has been recruiting around the world
[00:41:22.860 --> 00:41:27.740]   it is primarily through social media if you look at the way some of the white
[00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:31.260]   nationalist white supremacist movements are evolving
[00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:34.620]   they are using social media and and video
[00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:39.180]   to change people's perception and and normalize some of these topics
[00:41:39.180 --> 00:41:42.540]   i don't like this is a real hypothetical question for me
[00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:46.860]   i don't have a teenager and i was one and i definitely do not like the idea
[00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:51.900]   of my mother going through all of my notebooks all of my diaries things like
[00:41:51.900 --> 00:41:57.020]   that so there is a sliding scale of access that i think declines
[00:41:57.020 --> 00:42:01.020]   as one gets older and you risk pushing your teenager away further
[00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:05.260]   if you don't demonstrate some trust but i just know if you're under 12 that
[00:42:05.260 --> 00:42:08.860]   passcode is tattooed inside of my eyelids for sure
[00:42:08.860 --> 00:42:14.300]   yeah i don't want to downplay either the risks
[00:42:14.300 --> 00:42:18.060]   you know i don't i don't have i don't it's hard nowadays
[00:42:18.060 --> 00:42:21.820]   to be a parent in this digital era most parents are not as sophisticated as
[00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:26.380]   kids the truth is we know kids can get around whatever restrictions you
[00:42:26.380 --> 00:42:31.740]   place on this games begin yeah um so but at the same time i
[00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:34.940]   i i feel for parents in this era trying to raise
[00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:39.660]   a good kid i just thought the kids point of view i'll be represented we didn't
[00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:44.060]   hear a word of it right on apple baritone what did you you came out okay
[00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:50.940]   what did your mom do with you oh boy um she exposed me to a lot of
[00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:54.380]   different activities uh in terms like i was in the boy scouts
[00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:58.060]   right i went camping with her and with other groups
[00:42:58.060 --> 00:43:02.620]   i read a lot i had uh no girlfriends that freed up a lot of time
[00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:07.660]   uh to to read books and learn science did she keep women away or did you
[00:43:07.660 --> 00:43:11.420]   no no that was not her say i did it all on my own that was i was i was very
[00:43:11.420 --> 00:43:15.900]   talented at that non-talent um and yeah when i when i think i mean it was a
[00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:20.380]   different time i did have a computer and it was bulletin boards at the time and
[00:43:20.380 --> 00:43:23.820]   very early like 1400 baud
[00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:30.620]   9,600 28 k um you know speeds so it was just too slow like
[00:43:30.620 --> 00:43:34.540]   trouble happened more slowly back in the in the mid 90s it's glacial
[00:43:34.540 --> 00:43:38.140]   jim really it's a really want to do bad things and be like
[00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:42.700]   disciplined and persistent and my attention span was a bit short so i
[00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:45.900]   think she had a little less to worry about i mean and we had a
[00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:48.940]   neighborhood that was not the best one to grow up in and she moved us
[00:43:48.940 --> 00:43:52.700]   because she didn't want me to get sucked into some of the activities or the
[00:43:52.700 --> 00:43:55.980]   surveillance of the police work uh police work that's the nicest way
[00:43:55.980 --> 00:44:00.300]   i please work that wasn't really kind euphemism
[00:44:00.300 --> 00:44:03.740]   the pope pope by the way just this is our topic but i was also in boy scouts and
[00:44:03.740 --> 00:44:06.380]   i think that's why you and i were both so unsuccessful with getting girlfriends
[00:44:06.380 --> 00:44:09.900]   i think it was the boy scout that stuck to us yeah they could always tell so
[00:44:09.900 --> 00:44:13.260]   you you had a very strict family us for dish yeah i was in boy scouts forever
[00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:15.420]   and you know we didn't really have tv growing up and you know it was a
[00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:22.780]   christian conservative environment yeah did you feel oppressed i felt uh left
[00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:26.140]   out of a lot of stuff and and now that i've gotten older some of it i'm glad i
[00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:28.780]   missed some of them i wish that i hadn't i missed a lot of cartoons a lot of
[00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:32.300]   movies a lot of pop records are cultural yeah yeah but then the
[00:44:32.300 --> 00:44:35.340]   advantage though is back to brand tundra's point i read a lot
[00:44:35.340 --> 00:44:38.140]   i read so many i read lord with rings enough i brents took it away from me so
[00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:43.500]   i couldn't read it anymore um but uh i i think the children should
[00:44:43.500 --> 00:44:46.300]   be given space to grab an experiment especially among themselves
[00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:50.460]   and maybe that's why some phone access removal isn't so bad because
[00:44:50.460 --> 00:44:53.340]   the socialization you want children to have is probably mostly happening still
[00:44:53.340 --> 00:44:55.900]   offline even in the digital era well see that's why i wonder because
[00:44:55.900 --> 00:44:59.740]   neither nobody on this panel is young enough to actually have grown up with
[00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:04.620]   smartphones no that is a huge shift though that super computer in bed with
[00:45:04.620 --> 00:45:08.140]   you as you say brents i think that is a massive shift at a complete
[00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:11.820]   connection to the internet at all times i mean if it's not healthy for us and
[00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:15.020]   no one here is going to say that i will be for us back to our earlier point yeah
[00:45:15.020 --> 00:45:18.220]   it can't be good for children so my question isn't just how to spy on their
[00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:22.220]   web usage but when is it okay to say now you're old enough for x or
[00:45:22.220 --> 00:45:24.940]   versus y now with video games it's very easy to tell
[00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:28.460]   that's a tough one too but hang on it is tough when it comes to violence and
[00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:30.700]   gore and so forth i don't think it's that hard that when it comes to like
[00:45:30.700 --> 00:45:34.540]   addictiveness i agree it's more difficult but social media i mean how old would
[00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:38.380]   you let your kid start at fifteen thirteen twenty eight or five what if
[00:45:38.380 --> 00:45:41.340]   what if this is the future that generation
[00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:45.660]   this is how they're going to socialize this is how life is going to be for them
[00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:49.820]   wouldn't you want them to have the skills to navigate that world
[00:45:49.820 --> 00:45:52.540]   i mean the world even in the future is still going to be
[00:45:52.540 --> 00:45:58.060]   i r l and digital right it yes always because because what why did i come up
[00:45:58.060 --> 00:46:00.700]   here today i are fifteen-year-old yeah
[00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:05.660]   would it will send his friends home so he can play games with them on the
[00:46:05.660 --> 00:46:08.780]   internet we have a he has a good friend who's a neighbor
[00:46:08.780 --> 00:46:13.900]   yeah and he says go home i want to play online with you it's more
[00:46:13.900 --> 00:46:16.860]   that's better for him than having him in person but to be clear that they're
[00:46:16.860 --> 00:46:19.900]   talking they're doing cons rule they're communicating but it's all
[00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:23.100]   that doesn't bother me at all that's that's in i r l a little bit yeah because
[00:46:23.100 --> 00:46:26.220]   that's a synchronous phone conversation that we used to have on phones that we
[00:46:26.220 --> 00:46:29.260]   now just have on headsets like i do that with my friends we play destiny too
[00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:32.300]   and i remember and i know you do philip our generation
[00:46:32.300 --> 00:46:35.820]   bemoaning teenagers spending so much time on the phone
[00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:38.540]   right there was something wrong with them watching television or watching
[00:46:38.540 --> 00:46:41.020]   t-shirt on the phone bill there's always been something
[00:46:41.020 --> 00:46:44.380]   reway calling before the name is probably like they're on the radio so much they're
[00:46:44.380 --> 00:46:46.780]   reading books and before they're like they're reading books they should write
[00:46:46.780 --> 00:46:49.980]   their own books jeff javis brings us up every time when books when printing
[00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:53.420]   became commonplace people were very concerned that children weren't
[00:46:53.420 --> 00:46:57.580]   their imagination wasn't developing because they were reading so much and
[00:46:57.580 --> 00:47:00.700]   being told what to imagine well my favorite one is
[00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:05.340]   go ahead please go forward so i i i think radio rock and roll books
[00:47:05.340 --> 00:47:10.460]   you know tv magazines film all this imagination land stuff
[00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:14.620]   um oh that's a scarier book by the way imagination line
[00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:18.060]   oh i didn't agree got it i can't wait i wonder
[00:47:18.060 --> 00:47:20.940]   for me it's uh it sometimes comes down to scale
[00:47:20.940 --> 00:47:23.820]   right is there something categorically different
[00:47:23.820 --> 00:47:28.220]   about these networked technologies from the previous sort of broadcast
[00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:32.860]   technologies because access to books access to music access to
[00:47:32.860 --> 00:47:37.260]   printed materials is something very different from access to like ubiquitous
[00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:41.180]   communication and the ability for everyone to not just
[00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:45.900]   download information but to upload it and to engage in conversation and
[00:47:45.900 --> 00:47:49.100]   probably amazing magical things are going to happen
[00:47:49.100 --> 00:47:53.020]   with the next generations of people who are growing up in this or they're
[00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:56.860]   gonna live in the basement right and terrible thing
[00:47:56.860 --> 00:48:01.500]   to write i mean i don't also say extremist recruitment
[00:48:01.500 --> 00:48:05.180]   that's true the parkland students also reached out the yeah look at that
[00:48:05.180 --> 00:48:08.860]   pager yeah look at the organized at march yep and
[00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:12.860]   you know they were able to demonstrate a level of empathy
[00:48:12.860 --> 00:48:17.340]   that was previously so expensive yeah you had to find someone in another
[00:48:17.340 --> 00:48:19.660]   city who had experienced the same tragedy as you
[00:48:19.660 --> 00:48:23.420]   and to build a coalition with them would have taken so much effort so much
[00:48:23.420 --> 00:48:27.020]   money so much time and it's pretty much free now
[00:48:27.020 --> 00:48:29.740]   that's an excellent point parkland is the counter example
[00:48:29.740 --> 00:48:35.260]   myself about like so much panic i just think we should brace ourselves
[00:48:35.260 --> 00:48:39.180]   for a level of extreme good and extreme bad
[00:48:39.180 --> 00:48:42.540]   that we have an experience historically because the power
[00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:46.380]   wasn't distributed as widely as it is now yeah i'm still net positive
[00:48:46.380 --> 00:48:49.980]   on the internet as an impact on society by far i just think we're dealing with
[00:48:49.980 --> 00:48:53.340]   some new kinks and issues that we're always coming but we didn't know
[00:48:53.340 --> 00:48:56.220]   and so now we need to build new tooling to combat them and deal with these
[00:48:56.220 --> 00:48:57.900]   issues i mean from the start of the show with
[00:48:57.900 --> 00:48:59.980]   data privacy all the way through to this you know
[00:48:59.980 --> 00:49:03.180]   issue of watching children i mean we'll get through this and we'll still be
[00:49:03.180 --> 00:49:05.820]   net positive i think in the end
[00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:10.940]   the parkland students are are that was just a wonderful example of
[00:49:10.940 --> 00:49:15.820]   they were so sophisticated they were so media literate media literate they
[00:49:15.820 --> 00:49:20.940]   were better on media and the tv people were yes so they just they took over the
[00:49:20.940 --> 00:49:23.580]   stage and they these are kids who grew up they grew up
[00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:27.500]   cell phones and and but also their school had classes about civic engagement
[00:49:27.500 --> 00:49:31.340]   right so they weren't just gen y digital natives they were gen y
[00:49:31.340 --> 00:49:34.700]   digitalized with training and that combination took over every single cable
[00:49:34.700 --> 00:49:37.900]   news network it took over the blogs it took over the whole conversation
[00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:40.220]   and if that's what we're going to be able to see the kids do
[00:49:40.220 --> 00:49:43.900]   then bring it on because we don't need people like i don't know
[00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:46.700]   look at the leadership of the gop and democrats right now they're all ancient
[00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:50.220]   it's from new blood i'm in favor of it we didn't get to the most important
[00:49:50.220 --> 00:49:54.060]   announcement apple made uh on monday which is me moji but we'll get to that
[00:49:54.060 --> 00:49:57.420]   in just a second baritone day thursday is here
[00:49:57.420 --> 00:50:02.380]   hashtag manifest tunday you find it all at baritone day dot com
[00:50:02.380 --> 00:50:06.700]   always a pleasure to see you baritone day you too leo is a pleasure to hear your
[00:50:06.700 --> 00:50:10.140]   voice at the same time as your other like a synchronous
[00:50:10.140 --> 00:50:14.540]   it's a magic a magical thing as he's done
[00:50:14.540 --> 00:50:19.260]   the max headroom here is your girlfriend using the internet right now
[00:50:19.260 --> 00:50:22.620]   by the way there might be something in this my mom didn't i didn't know any
[00:50:22.620 --> 00:50:26.540]   girls when i was young because in i went to a boys only school in seventh
[00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:30.940]   eighth and ninth grade and i knew no girls and i do think that that was a
[00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:34.460]   benefit of course i got intense grade i came i went to
[00:50:34.460 --> 00:50:39.100]   Santa Cruz high in 1971 let me tell you i knew girls
[00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:42.860]   that changed everything but i but i think at that formative period i was
[00:50:42.860 --> 00:50:46.620]   stunted is that why we're all on a tech show right now yes i see
[00:50:46.620 --> 00:50:49.740]   speak for yourself i knew no girls films over here
[00:50:49.740 --> 00:50:53.980]   i was just crushing it here's some women i showed it
[00:50:53.980 --> 00:50:57.980]   phil valmer de witt p_e_d three oh dot com
[00:50:57.980 --> 00:51:00.700]   and of course from crunch base news editor-in-chief
[00:51:00.700 --> 00:51:04.700]   Alex will help have more just a second but first a word from word
[00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:09.660]   perhaps if you know uh one thing that's a healthy thing you can get your kids
[00:51:09.660 --> 00:51:13.260]   to do this digital and i say this because both my
[00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:18.620]   children just this month asked me to help them set up their websites
[00:51:18.620 --> 00:51:23.180]   katima website at wordpress.com that's where both abby and henry are
[00:51:23.180 --> 00:51:27.500]   henry came to me and said uh facebook's he's a photographer and a videographer
[00:51:27.500 --> 00:51:29.740]   and he said they're squeezing my pictures the quality's terrible
[00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:33.820]   were is there somewhere you could put images that i said yes your own website
[00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:37.820]   you shouldn't your facebook page is not your own
[00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:41.980]   your instagram is not your own your website that's your own and so he's at
[00:51:41.980 --> 00:51:45.660]   wordpress.com same thing with abby i want to put up my portfolio my resume
[00:51:45.660 --> 00:51:50.300]   she's starting to look for work for and that's the way to do it wordpress.com
[00:51:50.300 --> 00:51:55.180]   actually i sent it a wordpress.com/twit because she gets 15% off so that's a good
[00:51:55.180 --> 00:51:59.340]   thing wordpress that's where my site is leola port.com
[00:51:59.340 --> 00:52:03.740]   everybody i know when it comes to getting a website up fast and easy
[00:52:03.740 --> 00:52:07.820]   when you want to focus on content not on css
[00:52:07.820 --> 00:52:10.940]   wordpress.com you don't need to do the coding the design they give you all the
[00:52:10.940 --> 00:52:13.820]   tools you need hundreds of beautiful templates
[00:52:13.820 --> 00:52:17.180]   i was kind of touched my daughter completely spontaneously picked the
[00:52:17.180 --> 00:52:20.700]   same template as me there's hundreds i mean it wasn't like
[00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:25.180]   she had three to choose from she picked we both picked 2017 it's a very nice
[00:52:25.180 --> 00:52:28.780]   template i highly recommend it she kind of laughed she said
[00:52:28.780 --> 00:52:33.340]   what you're using that too yeah uh now if you want to sell stuff and henry
[00:52:33.340 --> 00:52:37.500]   does he says i want to sell pictures i said great wordpress has powerful e-commerce
[00:52:37.500 --> 00:52:41.420]   options you can get a buy button simple or have a complete online
[00:52:41.420 --> 00:52:43.580]   store it's up to you it's very affordable they're just
[00:52:43.580 --> 00:52:47.020]   starting out four dollars a month great deal
[00:52:47.020 --> 00:52:51.180]   i have the business plan uh which is a great deal for me because i got lots more
[00:52:51.180 --> 00:52:54.460]   templates lots more plugins help with seo
[00:52:54.460 --> 00:52:58.940]   i love the social sharing if you're a business or you want others to help
[00:52:58.940 --> 00:53:02.940]   spread the word about what you're up to she my daughter's a poet she does spoken
[00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:06.060]   word stuff and she wants she's doing poetry reading she
[00:53:06.060 --> 00:53:09.980]   wants to spread the word this social sharing is great because it means
[00:53:09.980 --> 00:53:13.260]   other people will post about it on their facebook and twitter and instagram and
[00:53:13.260 --> 00:53:17.180]   that really helps get the word out 30 percent of all the websites in the
[00:53:17.180 --> 00:53:21.020]   world run on wordpress that's not an accident it's because
[00:53:21.020 --> 00:53:25.420]   it's the best wordpress.com you'll get 15 percent off any new plan purchase
[00:53:25.420 --> 00:53:29.660]   if you go to wordpress.com/twit please go to wordpress.com/twit

[00:53:35.660 --> 00:53:40.300]   it's the best wordpress adding adding an addendum to that
[00:53:40.300 --> 00:53:43.820]   uh everything that i've ever written for has been wordpress based i think
[00:53:43.820 --> 00:53:46.220]   as a content manager as a content manager the tech crunch is wordpress
[00:53:46.220 --> 00:53:48.780]   tech crunch is wordpress uh crunch based news wordpress
[00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:52.460]   moving to new design also wordpress you're probably on the vip platform
[00:53:52.460 --> 00:53:55.900]   uh i think tc is uh word crunch based news is small
[00:53:55.900 --> 00:53:58.380]   so we don't need vip you don't need the vip no
[00:53:58.380 --> 00:54:03.180]   apple 3.0 wordpress there you go i was i'd use wordpress since met maulin
[00:54:03.180 --> 00:54:06.940]   we started it way back when i was at the time i was on uh
[00:54:06.940 --> 00:54:10.620]   remember movable type oh yeah i do i was i was on movable type
[00:54:10.620 --> 00:54:15.980]   and plugins remember plugins oh that was a bad time and then dark time
[00:54:15.980 --> 00:54:19.100]   and then along comes wordpress and i said this is awesome
[00:54:19.100 --> 00:54:23.100]   so i i've been using it more than a decade when gutenberg finally comes out
[00:54:23.100 --> 00:54:25.900]   and is fully released and that comes up onto it i want to come on talk about
[00:54:25.900 --> 00:54:29.260]   it what's gutenberg it's the new um typing
[00:54:29.260 --> 00:54:32.380]   section so you know i'll wordpress the back end you have kind of the similar uh
[00:54:32.380 --> 00:54:35.420]   yeah like interface where you kind of type your blogs i think gutenberg is the
[00:54:35.420 --> 00:54:38.540]   next iteration of that and it's supposed to be pretty fantastic
[00:54:38.540 --> 00:54:42.460]   it's a new editor i have yet to use it but i'm really excited about eventually
[00:54:42.460 --> 00:54:46.060]   getting my hands on it because uh using plugins and so forth to change how
[00:54:46.060 --> 00:54:50.300]   your wordpress install handles formatting and options is a pain in the butt
[00:54:50.300 --> 00:54:54.780]   and this is hopefully going to be what i've been looking for for roughly eight
[00:54:54.780 --> 00:54:59.260]   nine thousand posts now so i'm very stoked but here's here's the feature they
[00:54:59.260 --> 00:55:02.220]   don't tell you about the only thing you can write in gutenberg is a
[00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:07.180]   bible so no rough time so you are gonna do someone there's now
[00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:12.220]   we already have one man there's a whole bible it's long i've read it geez
[00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:15.580]   do you memorize it dude no no no just the name of the books
[00:55:15.580 --> 00:55:19.180]   that's a confirmation days i love it because uh when they have bible
[00:55:19.180 --> 00:55:21.980]   questions on jeopardy i can answer them and my wife says
[00:55:21.980 --> 00:55:25.660]   you're an atheist how you shouldn't answer those questions
[00:55:25.660 --> 00:55:28.860]   no we're in this literature we're an atheist because we can't answer those
[00:55:28.860 --> 00:55:31.420]   questions and if you don't get that joke i'm sorry if you're
[00:55:31.420 --> 00:55:33.500]   offended by i'm not sorry but you're right all right
[00:55:33.500 --> 00:55:36.940]   moving on uh he grew up on deviant goliath
[00:55:36.940 --> 00:55:40.940]   uh he grew up on vegitales yes and vegit that details not i grew up on deviant
[00:55:40.940 --> 00:55:44.060]   goliath there you go uh so let's i guess we should
[00:55:44.060 --> 00:55:50.060]   mention mimeojis you have to this by the way right after the digital well-being
[00:55:50.060 --> 00:55:53.180]   segment where they're talking about digital health and using the phone less
[00:55:53.180 --> 00:55:56.060]   and it's all they announced mimeojis it was there
[00:55:56.060 --> 00:55:59.180]   somebody there was an irony to this whole event
[00:55:59.180 --> 00:56:04.380]   yeah you know the um there must be people who use these things
[00:56:04.380 --> 00:56:08.060]   uh i think we're not the right audience oh oh
[00:56:08.060 --> 00:56:12.620]   oh you know i've i've sent an emojis to my kids
[00:56:12.620 --> 00:56:16.300]   and gotten zero back it's not something my kids are using
[00:56:16.300 --> 00:56:19.740]   that's like saying i sent a facebook request to my kids and they didn't
[00:56:19.740 --> 00:56:23.340]   accept it right i think they're trying to tell you something
[00:56:23.340 --> 00:56:26.860]   yeah maybe that's it um i guess it's because the
[00:56:26.860 --> 00:56:30.620]   70 percent of teens have iPhones as a stat i came across that i hope was right
[00:56:30.620 --> 00:56:34.140]   it is true it's in the u.s only but it's amazing
[00:56:34.140 --> 00:56:38.220]   and 80 percent say they if they don't have one they want one
[00:56:38.220 --> 00:56:41.580]   wow so there are these status symbol among these thing to have yeah this
[00:56:41.580 --> 00:56:45.020]   this is the piper hyperjafery stats are a little
[00:56:45.020 --> 00:56:49.500]   funky because they're interviewing kids in um
[00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:51.340]   high-income high school well of course
[00:56:51.340 --> 00:56:56.300]   well that's ridiculous then yeah that's so here's uh here's serenity called well
[00:56:56.300 --> 00:57:01.100]   oh that's pretty using emojis to lip sync
[00:57:01.100 --> 00:57:07.660]   kendrick lamar what's sizor so and sizor so
[00:57:07.660 --> 00:57:10.380]   actually what's interesting about this is her
[00:57:10.380 --> 00:57:14.380]   yeah that's how they work so you make them emoji and you draw it it doesn't
[00:57:14.380 --> 00:57:19.180]   take it from a picture it you actually create it with a mr potato head style
[00:57:19.180 --> 00:57:22.140]   sure they did it in the yeah it's very cool and then
[00:57:22.140 --> 00:57:27.020]   but then when you use it it superimposes the mamoji i'm sorry about the audio
[00:57:27.020 --> 00:57:31.180]   it's not good it superposes the mamoji on top of you and your body and your
[00:57:31.180 --> 00:57:36.300]   room so it is kind of it looks like you're wearing one of those
[00:57:36.300 --> 00:57:43.020]   mascot heads but it's like you're inside of roger rabbit it's oh gosh
[00:57:43.020 --> 00:57:46.780]   that's a that's a picture so this is who uses it the imore crew loves
[00:57:46.780 --> 00:57:51.100]   mamojis i i don't like this i i got over bit
[00:57:51.100 --> 00:57:54.780]   mojis i still use emojis but i think that's the end of my
[00:57:54.780 --> 00:57:58.620]   ogean because i can't take more stuff i i don't know about y'all but is anyone
[00:57:58.620 --> 00:58:01.100]   else who are busy like has stuff to do apparently
[00:58:01.100 --> 00:58:04.140]   therefore doesn't look at this and go yes this is what i do in the middle of
[00:58:04.140 --> 00:58:07.580]   the night oh this is what you do no explains a lot you can't do mamojis in
[00:58:07.580 --> 00:58:11.260]   the middle of night it's dark after the keynote i
[00:58:11.260 --> 00:58:14.860]   rather than going to the demos i went and talked to the developers who were
[00:58:14.860 --> 00:58:18.220]   in line oh what a good idea and uh they were awful
[00:58:18.220 --> 00:58:22.780]   fought yeah they were pretty uh harsh about about
[00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:27.180]   mamojis really yeah they said listen you know there was no improvement of the
[00:58:27.180 --> 00:58:30.620]   of the apps that people actually use there was nothing about phone there was
[00:58:30.620 --> 00:58:34.380]   nothing about stocks well they did do stocks but
[00:58:34.380 --> 00:58:38.620]   but and then why are they doing this stuff that nobody uses because it sells
[00:58:38.620 --> 00:58:42.780]   phones it must be and if you're a developer what you should want
[00:58:42.780 --> 00:58:47.420]   is more phone sold that broadens your base i think you could argue with them
[00:58:47.420 --> 00:58:52.060]   that guys this isn't for you yeah this is this is for this is for
[00:58:52.060 --> 00:58:54.700]   the average joe i don't know why i look at you
[00:58:54.700 --> 00:58:59.660]   the average joe who you know you can't do this on an android phone
[00:58:59.660 --> 00:59:02.620]   and this sells phones well sam's thing will copy it
[00:59:02.620 --> 00:59:05.900]   in about three times actually they're copying sam's songs oh
[00:59:05.900 --> 00:59:09.580]   yeah but the sam's song one is creepy because it uses your picture i'm very
[00:59:09.580 --> 00:59:12.940]   excited about this what is the sam's song one called i checked friends work for
[00:59:12.940 --> 00:59:16.780]   sam's it comes on the s9 you have to have an s9 let me see i have a
[00:59:16.780 --> 00:59:19.980]   whole library if i can find them of images i created
[00:59:19.980 --> 00:59:23.420]   so i could show you it's it's uncanny valley because
[00:59:23.420 --> 00:59:28.860]   um it's taking no what i'm counting cany valley is we talk about it a lot i
[00:59:28.860 --> 00:59:33.500]   bet you most of our audience does but uh that's the idea that
[00:59:33.500 --> 00:59:38.860]   yeah here's the uncanny valley if if if you um
[00:59:38.860 --> 00:59:42.940]   who is that supposed to be that's me it took a picture of me
[00:59:42.940 --> 00:59:47.260]   ooh it looks like bill clinton yeah i did not have sex with that woman
[00:59:47.260 --> 00:59:51.420]   Dutch politician gert wilders well it depends what it is is
[00:59:51.420 --> 00:59:56.700]   oh my god the star report just won't end that looks like you mixed with
[00:59:56.700 --> 01:00:00.140]   shawn hannity uh i think there's a little bit i'm
[01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:02.540]   gonna say a little Anderson Cooper uh yeah this this
[01:00:02.540 --> 01:00:05.580]   skins this skins this is the uncanny valley where
[01:00:05.580 --> 01:00:10.060]   it's it's humans are very finely attuned biology to detect
[01:00:10.060 --> 01:00:13.980]   normal and abnormal because somebody who's slightly abnormal could get you
[01:00:13.980 --> 01:00:19.020]   sick uh and so uh you know evolutionarily i think
[01:00:19.020 --> 01:00:23.180]   that we've discovered that the people survive better if they can detect
[01:00:23.180 --> 01:00:27.420]   somebody who's a zombie and so we can tell and it makes us very
[01:00:27.420 --> 01:00:30.060]   uncomfortable when it's close to human but not
[01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:34.300]   and that's the that's the valley that the valley is where it's you know in that
[01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:37.820]   it's you know cartoons Pixar looks great great great because they're not
[01:00:37.820 --> 01:00:41.980]   trying to look like a cartoon after as soon as you get to polar express
[01:00:41.980 --> 01:00:46.380]   with tom hanks it's creepy because it's closer
[01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:50.140]   but not close enough you get 100 percent or no more than 75 percent
[01:00:50.140 --> 01:00:54.620]   that last quarter so the apple opted i think wisely to do the cartoon version
[01:00:54.620 --> 01:00:59.180]   yeah samson almost like you samson's doing the
[01:00:59.180 --> 01:01:01.980]   uh there was one there was one for me that i
[01:01:01.980 --> 01:01:04.860]   i liked out of wdc that we haven't touched on
[01:01:04.860 --> 01:01:08.460]   uh and maybe you think it's not as big a deal but the idea of these uh
[01:01:08.460 --> 01:01:11.500]   ciri powered shortcuts oh that's to me the biggest
[01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:15.420]   together essentially like automator workflow uh
[01:01:15.420 --> 01:01:20.060]   types of functions to you know make sure your house is ready when you get home if
[01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:22.620]   you have an automated house which i don't
[01:01:22.620 --> 01:01:25.740]   or if you want to fire up some other operation
[01:01:25.740 --> 01:01:27.980]   that you can get directions you can find a recipe
[01:01:27.980 --> 01:01:31.420]   and it'll talk to multiple apps in a sequence
[01:01:31.420 --> 01:01:35.020]   and to accomplish a more complex task i i love that idea
[01:01:35.020 --> 01:01:38.940]   of if this then thatifying your your iphone and your iphone of course we'll
[01:01:38.940 --> 01:01:42.300]   see you know once they implement it and i signed up for the public beta but
[01:01:42.300 --> 01:01:45.340]   12 isn't yet in the public beta channel but it will soon
[01:01:45.340 --> 01:01:49.740]   but for the longest time i've i've actually
[01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:53.500]   made a bifurcation between android and apple apple
[01:01:53.500 --> 01:01:57.820]   and an iphone i recommended to people who didn't want to fuss with their phone
[01:01:57.820 --> 01:02:01.420]   they just kind of wanted it to work they they weren't invested
[01:02:01.420 --> 01:02:04.940]   in tweaking it or the capabilities of it
[01:02:04.940 --> 01:02:08.300]   android is more for people who like to customize who
[01:02:08.300 --> 01:02:11.500]   want power they want interact like malware
[01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:15.900]   yeah well okay but with great power comes great responsibility that's truly
[01:02:15.900 --> 01:02:19.340]   a that was an unfair dig it's a hand-in-hand thing i mean the more open a
[01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:23.740]   platform is the more risky it is right uh apple made a walled garden it's not
[01:02:23.740 --> 01:02:26.700]   very risky but it's also not particularly adventurous
[01:02:26.700 --> 01:02:31.980]   except to me this is this is a big leap for apple and this may
[01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:34.620]   actually put them in the territory of making a
[01:02:34.620 --> 01:02:38.060]   phone operating system that i think everybody will want to use
[01:02:38.060 --> 01:02:41.260]   because this is essentially adding program ability to
[01:02:41.260 --> 01:02:46.220]   to ios without coding without coding and that means you can make it
[01:02:46.220 --> 01:02:49.340]   and this is where google had such an adventure thing like google now
[01:02:49.340 --> 01:02:52.460]   or it's a well i see you're going to the airport you got airplane tickets i saw
[01:02:52.460 --> 01:02:55.260]   that in your email and that means you're gonna be going to the airport you
[01:02:55.260 --> 01:02:59.580]   should probably leave now because traffic's bad that was a very valuable tool apple
[01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:01.900]   doesn't want to do that because they don't want to look at your email
[01:03:01.900 --> 01:03:05.420]   but this is the beginning of that kind of power and i think they've done it in
[01:03:05.420 --> 01:03:09.580]   an interesting way um i see it as their answer to
[01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:14.300]   amazon's echo yep um series stupid yeah always been
[01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:17.740]   a laggard what better way to make series smart than add
[01:03:17.740 --> 01:03:20.540]   capabilities from other apps that's there he has one thing it can do
[01:03:20.540 --> 01:03:23.900]   fantastic it's an use that it can stitch together
[01:03:23.900 --> 01:03:27.340]   apps yeah what they haven't solved with theory is
[01:03:27.340 --> 01:03:31.100]   it understanding what i'm saying when i say it well it has a bit better at that
[01:03:31.100 --> 01:03:35.260]   but yeah so they they put some work into it it's not clear that they put the
[01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:38.540]   work where it was desperately needed well they bought an app called workflow and
[01:03:38.540 --> 01:03:42.220]   i think 90 percent of this is workflow yeah yeah
[01:03:42.220 --> 01:03:45.420]   uh yeah you know here's here's the things it'll depend on yes
[01:03:45.420 --> 01:03:49.340]   series has to understand you that's number one uh developers have to add
[01:03:49.340 --> 01:03:51.900]   this capability of their apps because a lot of it
[01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:54.700]   relies on for instance they did an example where
[01:03:54.700 --> 01:03:58.860]   uh series knows that you that this woman stops every morning to get a
[01:03:58.860 --> 01:04:02.060]   disgusting sounding drink called a mint mojito it fills coffee
[01:04:02.060 --> 01:04:04.860]   actually very very very good is it it's fantastic
[01:04:04.860 --> 01:04:08.060]   oh it sounds like get it get it fills way it's fantastic it's like four bucks
[01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:11.420]   get a small they'll be wired it's delightful but i'm assuming it has no
[01:04:11.420 --> 01:04:14.300]   rum in it no no otherwise i wouldn't be drinking it but
[01:04:14.300 --> 01:04:17.820]   like it's just it's got little bits of mint on top it's fantastic mint mojito
[01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:21.260]   redundant all me heatos have mint uh all good mojito's have mint you could
[01:04:21.260 --> 01:04:24.860]   abuse mojito and not having that okay and not abused mojito
[01:04:24.860 --> 01:04:28.380]   so but what's interesting is that's the fills app
[01:04:28.380 --> 01:04:31.820]   that is interacting with syri so she has the fills app
[01:04:31.820 --> 01:04:34.940]   the fills app knows she orders this coffee because it's
[01:04:34.940 --> 01:04:39.420]   she's ordering it through the app syri communicates with the fills app
[01:04:39.420 --> 01:04:43.100]   syri communicates with you saying the fills app told me in effect
[01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:46.220]   you get this mint mojito would you like me to order it you say yes
[01:04:46.220 --> 01:04:50.700]   it then contacts the fills app so if developers do that
[01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:55.980]   that is huge if that begins to knit together the various disparate parts of
[01:04:55.980 --> 01:04:59.660]   my phone in a way that's intelligent it helps me do things and is not creepy
[01:04:59.660 --> 01:05:02.700]   then i will be the happiest clam in the sea i'm worried about poor
[01:05:02.700 --> 01:05:04.860]   implementation i'm worried about it being a little pushy
[01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:07.900]   of course things will work on the details are excited about it
[01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:12.140]   we'll see and it's and it's more um explicitly
[01:05:12.140 --> 01:05:15.660]   it seems to me like it's more explicitly directed by the user
[01:05:15.660 --> 01:05:20.300]   than that's black box magic from you know the google assistant for example
[01:05:20.300 --> 01:05:23.900]   let's be fair what apple's really done is strategically brilliant
[01:05:23.900 --> 01:05:26.780]   they've they've said we'll not collect any information on you
[01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:32.060]   we'll let the apps do that and we'll let you be the one who weaves it together
[01:05:32.060 --> 01:05:36.060]   yeah but i mean the fills app knows exactly where you've been what you're
[01:05:36.060 --> 01:05:39.660]   doing what time of day is and what you order so that's kind of cool because
[01:05:39.660 --> 01:05:43.740]   this is a stupid you know it's not no one has a concentrated amount of data
[01:05:43.740 --> 01:05:48.620]   power okay right fills only knows my fake mojito preferences right
[01:05:48.620 --> 01:05:51.660]   right they have no idea about my commute for example right
[01:05:51.660 --> 01:05:55.180]   right and it solves the discoverability problem that
[01:05:55.180 --> 01:05:58.860]   amazon has there may be 10,000 things that it can do
[01:05:58.860 --> 01:06:02.700]   but how do i know what they are right right um presumably if you
[01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:05.980]   install a fills app and use fills a lot you don't have to do anything else
[01:06:05.980 --> 01:06:09.100]   serie will see that and then give you and stuff that you can act on i think
[01:06:09.100 --> 01:06:12.700]   that's great i think potentially this is a to me
[01:06:12.700 --> 01:06:15.100]   this might be the single most important feature on the uh
[01:06:15.100 --> 01:06:19.340]   on the iphone since it was released if serie if it all works can work well
[01:06:19.340 --> 01:06:21.500]   it's the first one that will change the way we actually interact with our
[01:06:21.500 --> 01:06:25.180]   phones i mean the iphone for all it's spent in polish over the years is still
[01:06:25.180 --> 01:06:28.780]   a grid of apps that do single things this actually bring them together in a
[01:06:28.780 --> 01:06:31.260]   way that's going to be precisely and fantastic and i i'm
[01:06:31.260 --> 01:06:35.660]   precisely giddy about this as a as a daily iphone user for a long time
[01:06:35.660 --> 01:06:38.140]   give me something that helps me that isn't just
[01:06:38.140 --> 01:06:41.420]   mimogies or dark mode those are nice little things but not really the core
[01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:44.940]   of what i want but what's it called when you create a sequence of steps for
[01:06:44.940 --> 01:06:48.540]   the computer they we've been doing that for years on the mac
[01:06:48.540 --> 01:06:55.740]   program i'll go with them well i said a note to salsa go in
[01:06:55.740 --> 01:07:00.060]   who was the guy who really created apple script and made it what it is he
[01:07:00.060 --> 01:07:03.500]   invented the automator he was the king of scripting at apple and apple fired
[01:07:03.500 --> 01:07:07.420]   him about a year ago they said your position has been eliminated
[01:07:07.420 --> 01:07:12.380]   and here it is ironically that exactly this the workflow stuff that is sal was
[01:07:12.380 --> 01:07:17.020]   espousing at apple for so many years in ios and i sent a note to him and said
[01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:23.020]   you must be both gratified and and sad and did he respond not yet i'm waiting
[01:07:23.020 --> 01:07:26.700]   but it must be tough for him because that's exactly i think he's gonna be
[01:07:26.700 --> 01:07:29.100]   gratified he's got a great job he went over to omni
[01:07:29.100 --> 01:07:32.860]   omni group is doing great stuff there include on automation by the way
[01:07:32.860 --> 01:07:37.820]   there's a lot of knives being wielded in the background oh
[01:07:37.820 --> 01:07:42.220]   uh-oh what's going on your kitchen uh dinner dinner stuff's happening
[01:07:42.220 --> 01:07:46.220]   oh yeah as as promised how nice do we think we're going to see something
[01:07:46.220 --> 01:07:48.700]   kind of like the if this then that for like i found
[01:07:48.700 --> 01:07:52.060]   dev some you're done hey you're so subtle i'm
[01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:56.780]   tracking i want to focus on the camera just so slightly and that was happening
[01:07:56.780 --> 01:08:01.580]   that's background so i'm like professional that was smooth
[01:08:01.580 --> 01:08:05.740]   it will have an idea yeah so i'm yeah i'm kind of excited about this
[01:08:05.740 --> 01:08:09.180]   yeah i'm stoked bringing it on yeah but ios 12 is still not even public beta
[01:08:09.180 --> 01:08:13.740]   yet so this is all pre-announced stuff yeah i this is so frustrating because
[01:08:13.740 --> 01:08:18.140]   it all you hear it all in june and it all looks great this is the part for
[01:08:18.140 --> 01:08:21.500]   developers right i know but i'm i want to use the stuff
[01:08:21.500 --> 01:08:26.220]   but it's and i don't want to use it a bit right so by the time fall comes around
[01:08:26.220 --> 01:08:30.540]   and it's out i've forgotten everything i learned in june and it's and it's hard
[01:08:30.540 --> 01:08:34.700]   to get up to see remind you if i don't think they're shy about letting you
[01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:37.740]   know why you should use their stuff you'll get a you'll see there will be some
[01:08:37.740 --> 01:08:41.100]   new videos that update the websites they'll push this off or update to remind
[01:08:41.100 --> 01:08:44.620]   you why it's somehow better than the last one and yeah
[01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:48.860]   i can think of many examples of apple creating a great technology automators
[01:08:48.860 --> 01:08:53.500]   a good one and just letting it die yeah and not getting adoption
[01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:57.100]   and just kind of it going away and and so many times we've seen an apple event
[01:08:57.100 --> 01:09:00.860]   where we've gotten really excited that this is going to change everything
[01:09:00.860 --> 01:09:04.940]   ar kit is a good example when ar kit was announced a year ago
[01:09:04.940 --> 01:09:09.340]   we saw all these toy apps and demos on twitter and everybody was
[01:09:09.340 --> 01:09:14.140]   excitedly doing that can you name the great ar app of the last year on
[01:09:14.140 --> 01:09:19.900]   azure measure was huge blew up no the point is absolutely not i mean
[01:09:19.900 --> 01:09:24.140]   people in talking about ar for consumers since pre four hollow lens
[01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:27.260]   and so far as i can tell the only app that ever really brought that to the
[01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:30.700]   mass market was pokemon go now apple demo
[01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:34.940]   what might be the route they think this is going to go when they had the
[01:09:34.940 --> 01:09:38.700]   two people with the slingshots that was kind of interesting
[01:09:38.700 --> 01:09:42.860]   over the ar yeah that idea of sharing of
[01:09:42.860 --> 01:09:47.100]   an augmented reality from multiple perspectives across multiple people
[01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:50.860]   is really interesting for design work for architectural work and all kinds of
[01:09:50.860 --> 01:09:53.740]   planning for games probably for stuff i can't
[01:09:53.740 --> 01:09:58.300]   riffle yeah the games the games could be huge you can see that it it'll prick
[01:09:58.300 --> 01:10:03.180]   pretty quickly move from blocks to dystopian worlds where you've got
[01:10:03.180 --> 01:10:07.020]   rail guns and you're shooting the people here's a rene richie and i just
[01:10:07.020 --> 01:10:12.060]   dean this is the sad part is if you're not in the game this is what you see
[01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:15.180]   is to it's not great two people focused on an empty table
[01:10:15.180 --> 01:10:19.580]   hallucination yeah like like money but they are having fun
[01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:23.420]   i can i couple of questions one is how long before your arms get tired
[01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:26.060]   you have to hold this in front of you to see it
[01:10:26.060 --> 01:10:30.140]   but maybe that's not a problem there was a a wonderful moment in the
[01:10:30.140 --> 01:10:33.180]   group or john grouber had a show the day after
[01:10:33.180 --> 01:10:37.180]   and they had the vice president of ar for apple there
[01:10:37.180 --> 01:10:42.780]   who explained what the new u_s_ d z thing is which is very interesting it's a
[01:10:42.780 --> 01:10:46.380]   new format for with adobe that adobe and apple are up well actually it's a
[01:10:46.380 --> 01:10:51.180]   Pixar farm sorry Pixar not to be a star it's universal scene description that
[01:10:51.180 --> 01:10:56.940]   Pixar has created and is the standard and what the z is is zipping
[01:10:56.940 --> 01:11:02.140]   so they make it small and it's what they want it's going to be the pdf
[01:11:02.140 --> 01:11:06.860]   of right uh it's a wrapper which is interesting so the four formats inside
[01:11:06.860 --> 01:11:10.220]   can vary yeah and you can drop it into another program
[01:11:10.220 --> 01:11:15.500]   if if this creates a new generation of interactive 3d
[01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:21.340]   immersive games uh that that only work on apple devices it could be a big thing
[01:11:21.340 --> 01:11:24.940]   for them um you can sort of see porn applications
[01:11:24.940 --> 01:11:29.420]   maybe never never because apple controls it and apple is not fun
[01:11:29.420 --> 01:11:32.860]   apple is not going maybe right but this that video we just showed over nay and
[01:11:32.860 --> 01:11:34.700]   i just need reminds me a little bit of the old pom pom pom
[01:11:34.700 --> 01:11:37.420]   disc because that was a super cool tanger as we've gone over
[01:11:37.420 --> 01:11:40.700]   and uh the pom poms had these little ir ports at the top
[01:11:40.700 --> 01:11:44.300]   and you could point two pom poms at each other and play games
[01:11:44.300 --> 01:11:48.380]   with the other person that was there and it was it was kind of janky it didn't
[01:11:48.380 --> 01:11:51.420]   really work that well but it pretty much works you play like like ping pong and
[01:11:51.420 --> 01:11:54.140]   whatnot and air hockey and i would say there was
[01:11:54.140 --> 01:11:59.420]   my my friend who had another pom pilot and we would do this for for hours
[01:11:59.420 --> 01:12:02.540]   and so i think the whole idea of bringing people together in the real world
[01:12:02.540 --> 01:12:05.020]   to do a digital experience together something that we haven't seen for a
[01:12:05.020 --> 01:12:08.940]   long time but it has a lot of potential and if it does work the way they're
[01:12:08.940 --> 01:12:12.140]   hoping it does i'm actually i hate to sound positive but apple but pretty
[01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:17.660]   excited that's Alex i i will give you what i think is the best example of this
[01:12:17.660 --> 01:12:23.500]   imagine ar space team yeah space team is fun that's the one my
[01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:27.340]   augmented reality microphone
[01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:31.500]   but tell people who don't know it's based team is tell them why that actually works
[01:12:31.500 --> 01:12:34.860]   so well it's what you described it is a multiplayer
[01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:40.540]   iRL and digital game so you are with up to three or four other people
[01:12:40.540 --> 01:12:46.940]   all crew on the bridge of a spaceship so much and you have to follow commands
[01:12:46.940 --> 01:12:51.580]   some of which are for people who have controls adjacent to you so
[01:12:51.580 --> 01:12:54.780]   you'll get a command you have to yell it out people have to paying attention
[01:12:54.780 --> 01:12:59.500]   and the commands are absurd things like fire the fire the indoplasmic
[01:12:59.500 --> 01:13:05.900]   reticulator and so it's fun it clearly played this game many times oh yeah
[01:13:05.900 --> 01:13:08.620]   i think it's solid team building skills honestly
[01:13:08.620 --> 01:13:13.180]   and so instead of being limited to the tiny space of your smartphone screen
[01:13:13.180 --> 01:13:17.020]   you could do it on a canvas of a blank table like you just showed with i just
[01:13:17.020 --> 01:13:20.700]   we did have a vr version of a star trek bridge
[01:13:20.700 --> 01:13:24.540]   oh really yeah that was kind of cool because i did the vr helmet game that was
[01:13:24.540 --> 01:13:28.220]   the bomb you had to undo on this show that was so hard yeah
[01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:31.580]   by the way none of this is new here's a picture of steve wasniak and his wife
[01:13:31.580 --> 01:13:35.820]   janet about eight years ago on their nintendo game boys
[01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:39.740]   connected by a wire they're playing Tetris with each other
[01:13:39.740 --> 01:13:44.540]   that's that's that's adorable isn't that apple watches on when was this done
[01:13:44.540 --> 01:13:46.780]   no those those are not apple watches those are
[01:13:46.780 --> 01:13:50.060]   one of them those are fitless oh you're right yeah and
[01:13:50.060 --> 01:13:53.900]   but the one on his and mozzes left wrist is his famous nixie watch
[01:13:53.900 --> 01:13:58.060]   which has nixie tubes the thing is huge what is a nixie tube that's those
[01:13:58.060 --> 01:14:02.220]   remember the old um segmented displays where you'd have numbers and each one
[01:14:02.220 --> 01:14:06.380]   was in a tube oh yeah yeah well that's actually how his watch works
[01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:08.940]   that just sounds like a okay never mind i'm not gonna be keke
[01:14:08.940 --> 01:14:12.620]   woz is a higher bishop in technology so i'm not going to make fun of his watch
[01:14:12.620 --> 01:14:16.940]   choice he is that watch choice defines his higher bishop
[01:14:16.940 --> 01:14:21.580]   prick here is his uh here is his other game he likes to play as long as we're at
[01:14:21.580 --> 01:14:25.420]   woz pictures this was a cruise we took with woz to south america
[01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:30.860]   he gets two dollar bills from the mint and binds them into a pad
[01:14:30.860 --> 01:14:33.660]   and his whole game that he plays there's the nixie watch a little bit better
[01:14:33.660 --> 01:14:36.620]   picture of the nixie watch the whole game that he plays is
[01:14:36.620 --> 01:14:42.940]   he tries he tries to use these uh to buy stuff and he wants them to arrest him
[01:14:42.940 --> 01:14:46.060]   yes he wants them to say that's counterfeit
[01:14:46.060 --> 01:14:50.060]   and so he has them on pads sometimes he'll take them on whole sheets and
[01:14:50.060 --> 01:14:54.140]   scissor them they're un i guess you can get uncut sheets if you're woz anyway
[01:14:54.140 --> 01:14:57.580]   from the treasury so he uses scissors and he says
[01:14:57.580 --> 01:15:01.100]   no no this is uh this what is he has a funny phrase he uses
[01:15:01.100 --> 01:15:05.340]   like this is a proved legal tender of
[01:15:05.340 --> 01:15:08.300]   so if you want to read if you want to hear more about this i actually i can
[01:15:08.300 --> 01:15:11.580]   tell you where to get it go read i was his books awesome there's
[01:15:11.580 --> 01:15:14.780]   it's not the best written book because he's not a writer but uh there's a lot of
[01:15:14.780 --> 01:15:17.420]   good ang up's about this sort of thing in there he loves pranks and its
[01:15:17.420 --> 01:15:20.380]   evidence that's exactly that maturity does not come with billions
[01:15:20.380 --> 01:15:22.940]   because you can have many billions and still be a total prankster
[01:15:22.940 --> 01:15:27.740]   yep it's not that book yep oh i the chat room reminds me i started to talk
[01:15:27.740 --> 01:15:31.500]   about groobers uh after the talk show yeah yeah and at one point
[01:15:31.500 --> 01:15:36.140]   um uh you know we're dealing with this thing where you're holding up the thing
[01:15:36.140 --> 01:15:39.820]   he said now you guys have been talking for years about you're not going to make
[01:15:39.820 --> 01:15:44.380]   a touchscreen mac because it's unnatural to be pointing a finger
[01:15:44.380 --> 01:15:49.980]   right but now you're telling us to walk around like this and it and so clearly
[01:15:49.980 --> 01:15:53.820]   the the conclusion is that it makes much more sense to have the technology in
[01:15:53.820 --> 01:15:56.860]   your glasses yeah yes we're a long way just not there yet
[01:15:56.860 --> 01:16:00.860]   yeah but it reminds me we could have we could have neck harnesses where we put
[01:16:00.860 --> 01:16:04.940]   on i want i want a little a little uh little
[01:16:04.940 --> 01:16:09.260]   tray a little brace that just holds the ipad oh no you have to be a risk after
[01:16:09.260 --> 01:16:12.140]   market you would look so cool like this this is fantastic i've never looked
[01:16:12.140 --> 01:16:17.020]   better than you right now yeah goes around your neck i'm on the
[01:16:17.020 --> 01:16:21.100]   board of this organization it's uh build build.org shout out to the kids
[01:16:21.100 --> 01:16:25.420]   and they use entrepreneurship to help kids stay in school and one of the teams
[01:16:25.420 --> 01:16:29.900]   made a smartphone holder that literally is like you put this
[01:16:29.900 --> 01:16:32.220]   thing around your neck it's really lightweight
[01:16:32.220 --> 01:16:35.500]   and it's so you can you can basically like watch youtube while you're walking
[01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:40.140]   to school oh my gosh perfect okay now i'm gonna go back and change my
[01:16:40.140 --> 01:16:44.380]   answer this is great yeah build i'm now in favor of more
[01:16:44.380 --> 01:16:47.820]   parental controls after hearing that story on our smartphones i take it back
[01:16:47.820 --> 01:16:52.220]   yeah he's now he's down with the man aka
[01:16:52.220 --> 01:16:55.900]   that's brilliant kids kids are always smarter than adults i think in the end
[01:16:55.900 --> 01:17:00.220]   it's encouraging for the future i hope so god otherwise we're in trouble i have
[01:17:00.220 --> 01:17:04.700]   a topic i want to talk about apple tv's at most support
[01:17:04.700 --> 01:17:09.020]   no what well whatever would you like to talk about
[01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:13.020]   philip i wanted to talk about a little line that that got tucked in when they
[01:17:13.020 --> 01:17:16.540]   were talking about the great apps that they were going to bring
[01:17:16.540 --> 01:17:21.580]   to ios to the mac and um maybe that wasn't the context but this
[01:17:21.580 --> 01:17:24.220]   woman named susan they didn't give her a last name
[01:17:24.220 --> 01:17:27.900]   said that's you know we're we're doing this and we're doing that but the very
[01:17:27.900 --> 01:17:32.460]   best thing is we're bringing apple news to stocks
[01:17:32.460 --> 01:17:38.220]   so that the apple news stories are going to be curated by apple editors
[01:17:38.220 --> 01:17:45.900]   and i my thought is there's no more business news feed is more polluted by
[01:17:45.900 --> 01:17:51.660]   fud and fanboyism than apple but and it should be curated
[01:17:51.660 --> 01:17:56.540]   but not by apple i mean you you could be the an editor with the best heart and
[01:17:56.540 --> 01:18:00.620]   mind and and but there's no way to be in apple's
[01:18:00.620 --> 01:18:05.260]   employ and to treat apple new to curate apple news in a fair and even
[01:18:05.260 --> 01:18:09.340]   are you saying that they would be biased and how they would curate the news
[01:18:09.340 --> 01:18:12.860]   about the company for which they work they would be they would feel like their
[01:18:12.860 --> 01:18:16.780]   hands are tied i worked for timing for a long time and there was no story you
[01:18:16.780 --> 01:18:20.380]   didn't want to be assigned then a time Warner business
[01:18:20.380 --> 01:18:24.620]   because it would get edited you know by by layers of editor all the way up to
[01:18:24.620 --> 01:18:27.020]   the top and then it would get you know the lawyers
[01:18:27.020 --> 01:18:31.420]   and i see well and and furthermore anybody who's editing this working at
[01:18:31.420 --> 01:18:34.620]   apple also has apple stock so they're conflicted by the
[01:18:34.620 --> 01:18:38.220]   very nature they shouldn't even get into it
[01:18:38.220 --> 01:18:42.380]   and that was weird by the way there's no stock app or website in the world that
[01:18:42.380 --> 01:18:45.980]   doesn't have news it's not an invention
[01:18:45.980 --> 01:18:47.980]   now they're getting into the commodity business they're gonna
[01:18:47.980 --> 01:18:51.340]   yeah i gotta say though in defense of apple news it
[01:18:51.340 --> 01:18:56.540]   it is the single best way to find out what's going on on an iPhone that the
[01:18:56.540 --> 01:19:00.140]   apple curated news thing they they're scraping the right
[01:19:00.140 --> 01:19:03.580]   content they're uh it's fairly well balanced they
[01:19:03.580 --> 01:19:08.460]   thrown some fox news uh it turns out is that your that's your
[01:19:08.460 --> 01:19:11.980]   definition well for me it exposes me to things i'm not
[01:19:11.980 --> 01:19:16.060]   seen by fox news the wall street journal the new york times and
[01:19:16.060 --> 01:19:21.180]   and what have you used the new google news i get google news on my
[01:19:21.180 --> 01:19:25.260]   no no you have to install the new google news app i have to and i want you to
[01:19:25.260 --> 01:19:28.140]   compare that to the apple okay because it's very
[01:19:28.140 --> 01:19:32.540]   very is it mirrored at google news.google.com will you know or is this
[01:19:32.540 --> 01:19:35.980]   no it's a mobile experience they took the old news stand app
[01:19:35.980 --> 01:19:42.540]   and they uh renamed it google news and it's so the what you get is you get
[01:19:42.540 --> 01:19:48.220]   uh a curated five story for you that's based on what your interests are and
[01:19:48.220 --> 01:19:51.660]   your right and by the way they know my location so there's a local news story
[01:19:51.660 --> 01:19:57.660]   and stuff but then each story uh has a button on it that is
[01:19:57.660 --> 01:20:01.340]   full coverage and at that point it's no longer curated
[01:20:01.340 --> 01:20:06.060]   they say everybody will see the same thing and i do they have a pay the
[01:20:06.060 --> 01:20:08.780]   journalist button as well i wish they did because they are
[01:20:08.780 --> 01:20:12.540]   after all scraping but i think you know nowadays uh
[01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:16.460]   companies understand that sending them traffic is is something of value
[01:20:16.460 --> 01:20:19.660]   so if you go to headlines you're getting the same headlines everybody else is
[01:20:19.660 --> 01:20:22.140]   getting and i kind of like that i think that mixes
[01:20:22.140 --> 01:20:25.260]   the value of an agri algorithmic feed with
[01:20:25.260 --> 01:20:30.060]   having a common point of view yeah you have favorites so you can control it
[01:20:30.060 --> 01:20:33.420]   and they've kept the subscription news stand in there and actually leo it is
[01:20:33.420 --> 01:20:37.660]   mirrored at on the web i just went to news.google.com it's the same and
[01:20:37.660 --> 01:20:41.980]   the left rail top stories for you favorite cities searches which i think is the
[01:20:41.980 --> 01:20:44.540]   same as your podcast thank you for the correction so you can now do it on the
[01:20:44.540 --> 01:20:48.380]   web yeah as well oh yeah it is the same news yeah
[01:20:48.380 --> 01:20:52.300]   yeah it's so that's the new google news it's interesting i didn't realize they
[01:20:52.300 --> 01:20:56.540]   put it on the web as well but this is for average people right this is aimed at
[01:20:56.540 --> 01:21:01.580]   the masses is that correct it's aimed at me see all of us are to one degree or
[01:21:01.580 --> 01:21:04.940]   another professionally interested in the current news so we have different
[01:21:04.940 --> 01:21:08.220]   habits and right because i downloaded google news when it came out from my
[01:21:08.220 --> 01:21:10.940]   phone and it was immediately like this is just clunky and slow i would need my
[01:21:10.940 --> 01:21:14.140]   twitter feed now but then now that i think about it in this context this is not
[01:21:14.140 --> 01:21:18.620]   designed for me this is designed for you know it's not a fire hose no it's just
[01:21:18.620 --> 01:21:21.900]   far too slow for what i'd like yeah i mean i i mean
[01:21:21.900 --> 01:21:26.460]   maybe i'm old-fashioned but i still have a a folder of news bookmarks that i one
[01:21:26.460 --> 01:21:29.980]   by one go through each morning that is old-fashioned
[01:21:29.980 --> 01:21:34.140]   but everyone who's ever edited in front page appreciates you
[01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:38.620]   well but that's that's what i do i have uh you know uh tech memes number one and
[01:21:38.620 --> 01:21:43.980]   then nuzzle and then reddit and then uh i do have apple 3.0 is right up yeah
[01:21:43.980 --> 01:21:49.500]   right up there uh medium i always read medium i do have uh feedly right which
[01:21:49.500 --> 01:21:53.180]   is a news traditional news reader but nobody uses
[01:21:53.180 --> 01:21:56.540]   does anybody use news readers like this anymore
[01:21:56.540 --> 01:21:59.420]   it was a better era but the answer appears we know we've all moved to social
[01:21:59.420 --> 01:22:04.220]   feeds that's such a mistake twitter is a bad place to get your twitter is a bad
[01:22:04.220 --> 01:22:08.460]   place for everybody but we all go there i'll be there the whole way home i stopped
[01:22:08.460 --> 01:22:12.780]   doing it i think it's polluting my brain how did you stop though i took it off
[01:22:12.780 --> 01:22:16.300]   my phone and then how'd you not reinstall it's like quitting cigarettes for me
[01:22:16.300 --> 01:22:20.700]   like i can do is very much i can mostly do but i just it's almost exactly like
[01:22:20.700 --> 01:22:26.380]   that it's tough because i check in when with how i feel after i read twitter
[01:22:26.380 --> 01:22:32.060]   and i always feel upset i always feel there's a lot of anger there's a lot of
[01:22:32.060 --> 01:22:35.820]   outrage it's gotten worse i think some of our
[01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:40.140]   national psychosis can be directly attributed to the bully and chief on
[01:22:40.140 --> 01:22:44.780]   twitter uh i i feel leo leo you're following the wrong
[01:22:44.780 --> 01:22:48.220]   twitter you gotta get in on that cupcake twitter everybody tells me that
[01:22:48.220 --> 01:22:53.180]   everybody tells me that puppy twitter amazing but but i gotta tell you this
[01:22:53.180 --> 01:22:56.060]   follow cupcake twitter or puppy twitter or whatever
[01:22:56.060 --> 01:22:59.980]   dopey twitter you want to follow and it won't be long
[01:22:59.980 --> 01:23:04.460]   before there's cupcake wars no no no no dog twitter is actually pretty good
[01:23:04.460 --> 01:23:07.980]   there's never been a war in dog twitter except for when brand tried to make fun
[01:23:07.980 --> 01:23:12.140]   of dog rates that's an inside joke but mostly cupcake twitter is fine i think
[01:23:12.140 --> 01:23:15.740]   you can't find something to find cupcake twitter or dog twitter
[01:23:15.740 --> 01:23:19.660]   you find the people that engage in cupcake or dog on the phone all the rest of
[01:23:19.660 --> 01:23:23.020]   them you just you just build them into your feed that you know darth
[01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:27.100]   so yes i know darth is an example of of weird twitter that you can bring into
[01:23:27.100 --> 01:23:30.300]   your life to bring some light to your feed and i think that we could all do
[01:23:30.300 --> 01:23:33.340]   that a little bit more i just follow six thousand journalists but just why my
[01:23:33.340 --> 01:23:36.620]   feed's awful i i have a lot of news in my feed
[01:23:36.620 --> 01:23:39.500]   i have a lot of news i have not exactly known for not fighting um
[01:23:39.500 --> 01:23:42.940]   and i just you know first of all the algorithm portion of twitter has
[01:23:42.940 --> 01:23:47.660]   really screwed things up there is no way to do a chronological feed anymore
[01:23:47.660 --> 01:23:52.220]   uh you can through tweeting which is a tweet deck derivative okay
[01:23:52.220 --> 01:23:55.820]   uh at tweeting app on twitter i do use tweeting and tweet deck i use as well
[01:23:55.820 --> 01:23:59.660]   those both still actually one of the one of the tips that somebody uh told me
[01:23:59.660 --> 01:24:03.580]   for tweet deck and does clean up twitter a lot tweet deck
[01:24:03.580 --> 01:24:09.020]   allows you to turn off retweets and so a lot of the stuff that's bad on twitter
[01:24:09.020 --> 01:24:13.340]   is the viral retweeting of outrageous omenate take out the
[01:24:13.340 --> 01:24:16.700]   my tweets and all this so we just focus on the one column
[01:24:16.700 --> 01:24:22.620]   um but without the retweets in there uh you actually get a little bit better
[01:24:22.620 --> 01:24:26.540]   content but i'm telling you ten tweets in and i'm angry i'm like
[01:24:26.540 --> 01:24:31.580]   got my guts churning i tweet for you you're gonna tweet me i tweet it you're
[01:24:31.580 --> 01:24:35.500]   checking to see if i'm following you you are following me there it is
[01:24:35.500 --> 01:24:39.260]   excellent but i already am following you but that's for everyone else is on the
[01:24:39.260 --> 01:24:41.420]   feed oh
[01:24:41.420 --> 01:24:46.380]   um i i didn't even bring us back to twitter i didn't mean to
[01:24:46.380 --> 01:24:49.180]   this is a polluter i'm sorry but this is a polluted stream
[01:24:49.180 --> 01:24:53.820]   i don't care if you mix the fresh water into the excrement it's still a polluted
[01:24:53.820 --> 01:24:56.940]   stream but it is the stream to which i still drink from so if i'm gonna have to
[01:24:56.940 --> 01:25:00.300]   drink the crap you want to i mean is polluted my brain have you've met me you
[01:25:00.300 --> 01:25:03.100]   know that i'm just saying like that's that's where i have to swim i am a
[01:25:03.100 --> 01:25:05.980]   journalist this is what i do all the time i disagree i think that's the worst
[01:25:05.980 --> 01:25:10.620]   place for a journalist to swim in fact it drives me crazy that i see this across
[01:25:10.620 --> 01:25:15.900]   the board even in mainstream media oh my god this is outrageous everybody's
[01:25:15.900 --> 01:25:18.620]   pissed off about this that or the other it they're
[01:25:18.620 --> 01:25:22.700]   looking at twitter where everybody's pissed off about everything all the time
[01:25:22.700 --> 01:25:26.780]   any journalist that is measuring the value or importance of a story
[01:25:26.780 --> 01:25:30.540]   or people's reaction to it by what they see in their twitter feed is making a
[01:25:30.540 --> 01:25:33.980]   massive error i'm so glad you did that in your twitter voice that's what twitter
[01:25:33.980 --> 01:25:38.860]   sounds like this is what twitter is like you will like it
[01:25:38.860 --> 01:25:43.020]   short sentences get off my lawn voice wait can you bear in tundell isn't isn't
[01:25:43.020 --> 01:25:46.060]   that a case isn't that the case though that a lot of mainstream media now
[01:25:46.060 --> 01:25:50.220]   if it's got action on twitter that's a new story absolutely that's dopey have you
[01:25:50.220 --> 01:25:54.940]   watched have you watched the fourth estate it's yeah it's uh
[01:25:54.940 --> 01:25:58.220]   i've heard of the year of the new of the new york times i want to watch this i
[01:25:58.220 --> 01:26:01.980]   so it's incredible the first episode is amazing because it's all
[01:26:01.980 --> 01:26:05.980]   trump gets elected in the new york scene how the new york times covers it
[01:26:05.980 --> 01:26:09.340]   and one of the things they do visually is you see
[01:26:09.340 --> 01:26:13.260]   maggie haberman writing a story and some in some in some in cibit scene her
[01:26:13.260 --> 01:26:17.660]   and then so and the words are actually appearing on the screen she types them
[01:26:17.660 --> 01:26:22.220]   and then the tweets start appearing about how it's and the numbers of tweets
[01:26:22.220 --> 01:26:25.180]   that got it got retweeted and then she's on
[01:26:25.180 --> 01:26:28.780]   morning joe talking about maggie by the way maggie haberman is one of the
[01:26:28.780 --> 01:26:32.300]   people i consider ruined by twitter
[01:26:32.300 --> 01:26:35.900]   well i think twitter has destroyed her credibility as a journalist
[01:26:35.900 --> 01:26:41.820]   she's posted stuff on twitter she by now deeply regrets uh twitter has been
[01:26:41.820 --> 01:26:46.060]   a bane to somebody who used to be a good reporter
[01:26:46.060 --> 01:26:49.660]   she has i've just watched her gain weight
[01:26:49.660 --> 01:26:54.460]   and i blame it on twitter all the last 30 seconds is problematic but let's
[01:26:54.460 --> 01:26:59.980]   let's let's let's i'm so if you're watching this i didn't say any of that too
[01:26:59.980 --> 01:27:03.980]   ignoring that entire comment she's tweeted she's got so much trouble
[01:27:03.980 --> 01:27:07.100]   for the things she has tweeted which things have she tweeted do you think
[01:27:07.100 --> 01:27:09.980]   that got her in trouble i'm curious about the specific examples or at least the
[01:27:09.980 --> 01:27:13.500]   range oh i we have to do is it after i've tried this right it's political it's
[01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:17.180]   not technical but it but i will show you a number of
[01:27:17.180 --> 01:27:20.860]   tweets that she deeply regrets i'm sure if she doesn't then she's
[01:27:20.860 --> 01:27:24.380]   well in the in the process of the show they had to take one of the reporters
[01:27:24.380 --> 01:27:28.620]   tweets away twitter away from him take twitter away from everybody
[01:27:28.620 --> 01:27:31.500]   or that's my motto that president doesn't that's great
[01:27:31.500 --> 01:27:36.540]   well by the way if if if i tweeted some of the stuff the president tweets
[01:27:36.540 --> 01:27:40.700]   i would be banned from twitter yeah yeah he's violated it he's he's he's
[01:27:40.700 --> 01:27:43.980]   allowed to be a bully and by the way a bully with nuclear weapons
[01:27:43.980 --> 01:27:47.820]   on twitter is that not in and of itself a problem
[01:27:47.820 --> 01:27:51.580]   at jack plas i mean you can i don't get jack does it give a damn are you
[01:27:51.580 --> 01:27:55.500]   getting me that was the joke yeah actually i like jack do the ad
[01:27:55.500 --> 01:28:00.700]   i don't know jack jack jack dorsey away from the weird comments and back to
[01:28:00.700 --> 01:28:04.300]   screaming it still see you is he ceo yes and stocks done very well in the last
[01:28:04.300 --> 01:28:06.860]   12 months and they've shown gap profits and rising userships so
[01:28:06.860 --> 01:28:11.580]   hashtag go jock really rising usership and slowly that's what going on how much
[01:28:11.580 --> 01:28:14.220]   rising uh is it going up or is it going down by
[01:28:14.220 --> 01:28:16.860]   statements days
[01:28:16.860 --> 01:28:19.900]   the where this has been a troublesome four minutes i think we should
[01:28:20.380 --> 01:28:23.900]   why you're stalking twitter no no not the the preceding bit why does anybody
[01:28:23.900 --> 01:28:26.140]   want to defend twitter that's what i don't understand it's not about
[01:28:26.140 --> 01:28:29.580]   defending twitter it's just it's about moving away from the crater in the
[01:28:29.580 --> 01:28:34.540]   ground that is twitter i risked my case i live in this
[01:28:34.540 --> 01:28:38.460]   it sucks everything into its black hole mall
[01:28:38.460 --> 01:28:44.620]   so i think maybe instead of um avoiding twitter we should have Leo avoid
[01:28:44.620 --> 01:28:47.340]   talking about twitter we're seeing him more sitting
[01:28:47.340 --> 01:28:50.780]   using twitter itself okay and we have so much other news there's a
[01:28:50.780 --> 01:28:53.580]   team coming out yeah no we're going to talk about that fact we're going to
[01:28:53.580 --> 01:28:56.460]   get on from apple yeah we got to get away from apple because we spent this whole
[01:28:56.460 --> 01:28:58.540]   show on apple and there's a lot more to talk about we will be
[01:28:58.540 --> 01:29:02.380]   we'll be putting yeah in just a little bit but i first i want to talk about
[01:29:02.380 --> 01:29:07.740]   Anthony Bourdain who of course died this week committed suicide very
[01:29:07.740 --> 01:29:12.780]   sadly same age as me exactly um it's just a great tragedy
[01:29:12.780 --> 01:29:16.780]   and it made me think i got to go back and read his book kitchen confidential but
[01:29:16.780 --> 01:29:20.060]   i've got the best way to read his book i'll watch me turn this into an ad
[01:29:20.060 --> 01:29:23.500]   yeah careful you're on risky ice now Leo
[01:29:23.500 --> 01:29:26.300]   this is a strange four minutes still
[01:29:26.300 --> 01:29:30.060]   where it gets strange this is a audible doc i'm no no honestly uh
[01:29:30.060 --> 01:29:34.140]   his book kitchen confidential his first book has become a best seller once again
[01:29:34.140 --> 01:29:38.060]   it's back up the charts because everybody's saying i gotta read that again or if i
[01:29:38.060 --> 01:29:41.740]   haven't read it i've got to read it but if you haven't listened to it this
[01:29:41.740 --> 01:29:45.340]   is the way to consume it Anthony Bourdain reads his own book one of the things i
[01:29:45.340 --> 01:29:49.740]   like about audible is when you hear authors in their own
[01:29:49.740 --> 01:29:55.020]   voice reading their books uh some people should not read but baritone
[01:29:55.020 --> 01:29:59.340]   day you read your book right yes i do and and how to be black
[01:29:59.340 --> 01:30:03.100]   has particular resonance when you read it you wouldn't want anybody else to
[01:30:03.100 --> 01:30:07.820]   read it would you no no and given that uh apples announced dark mode again i
[01:30:07.820 --> 01:30:12.940]   just think it's perfect let me play a little of Anthony Bourdain
[01:30:12.940 --> 01:30:17.660]   reading kitchen confidential adventures in the culinary needless to say the
[01:30:17.660 --> 01:30:21.580]   pressure the fear and the anticipation in the weeks before scoffee room were
[01:30:21.580 --> 01:30:26.780]   palpable it was an open kitchen a large window about his time at the
[01:30:26.780 --> 01:30:31.660]   culinary and slime directors talking about the last day work stations
[01:30:31.660 --> 01:30:34.780]   reviewed the crimes and horrors and disappointment you know what
[01:30:34.780 --> 01:30:39.740]   it when i reread it i realized this is why Bourdain was so beloved he is
[01:30:39.740 --> 01:30:43.420]   great he is honest he's real he's genuine
[01:30:43.420 --> 01:30:47.420]   um and he talks about life without any pulling any punches and i think i
[01:30:47.420 --> 01:30:50.860]   really admire that different officials amazing amazing book
[01:30:50.860 --> 01:30:55.580]   uh i'll show you some other things on my i'm reading the robin uh william's

[01:32:00.780 --> 01:32:03.580]   because i'm always talking about a book i'm listening to and i share it with
[01:32:03.580 --> 01:32:06.220]   people you can also share clips which is really nice
[01:32:06.220 --> 01:32:09.580]   so i could take that anthony board and clip and share it with you which is
[01:32:09.580 --> 01:32:14.220]   fantastic they have speed control i know a lot of people listen to our shows
[01:32:14.220 --> 01:32:16.860]   at twice this week oh gosh what do we sound like
[01:32:16.860 --> 01:32:20.380]   that was the way actually the funny thing is when they come in studio and they
[01:32:20.380 --> 01:32:23.340]   listen they say you guys all sound drunk i'm not used to you speaking in
[01:32:23.340 --> 01:32:29.660]   such slow relationships speaking strongly audible is used listen faster or slower
[01:32:29.660 --> 01:32:32.780]   if you want so you can tune the narration some people listen
[01:32:32.780 --> 01:32:36.860]   like i can't i want to hear like i want to relish the book i want to do it go
[01:32:36.860 --> 01:32:39.900]   a little bit slower whisper sync is awesome if you have a
[01:32:39.900 --> 01:32:43.580]   kindle uh you can buy the book on the kindle
[01:32:43.580 --> 01:32:47.340]   and listen to the book at the same time you can see the text as you're reading
[01:32:47.340 --> 01:32:51.100]   this is really a nice feature called whisper sync for voice
[01:32:51.100 --> 01:32:54.060]   of course you can listen to audiobooks on your echo
[01:32:54.060 --> 01:32:57.980]   sonos now supports audible on thanking the lord because that means i could put my
[01:32:57.980 --> 01:33:01.100]   book on throughout the entire house as i want to around do the chores do the
[01:33:01.100 --> 01:33:05.420]   dishes and keep listening you never lose your place or miss a word
[01:33:05.420 --> 01:33:09.100]   i i just love and the thing is you're always there's always times you're
[01:33:09.100 --> 01:33:13.820]   doing something that you you know you can't hold a book but you can listen
[01:33:13.820 --> 01:33:18.380]   it it recovered reading for me uh because i was so busy and i couldn't
[01:33:18.380 --> 01:33:22.460]   hold the book and i'd fall asleep at night now i read a couple hours a day
[01:33:22.460 --> 01:33:25.900]   because there's always that downtime the time in the car the time
[01:33:25.900 --> 01:33:29.900]   washing the dishes audible members get a credit every month good for any audiobook
[01:33:29.900 --> 01:33:33.180]   regardless of price on unused credits roll over to the next month
[01:33:33.180 --> 01:33:35.820]   so the subscription is really the right way to go
[01:33:35.820 --> 01:33:38.940]   and of course if at any time you say i like this book you can exchange it for
[01:33:38.940 --> 01:33:43.420]   another no questions asked and your books are yours to keep
[01:33:43.420 --> 01:33:47.500]   they're in your library i've been an audible member since 2000

[01:34:24.780 --> 01:34:28.860]   if you want to hear Anthony Bourdain now instead of this lame show

[01:34:35.180 --> 01:34:40.380]   a ud i b l e.com/twit i love audible i listen to books always
[01:34:40.380 --> 01:34:43.740]   it's the longer the better 40-hour books i love it
[01:34:43.740 --> 01:34:46.940]   it you know it sort of organizes a whole month
[01:34:46.940 --> 01:34:50.380]   i yeah i left a book at a coffee shop yesterday that i bought at an airport
[01:34:50.380 --> 01:34:52.940]   i had to read about an amazon last night to have it redelivered to me and i
[01:34:52.940 --> 01:34:56.300]   can read the last four chapters i'm actually kind of in favor of audiobooks
[01:34:56.300 --> 01:34:59.580]   first time i only because i never lose it i bought that book twice now and it's
[01:34:59.580 --> 01:35:02.380]   bad it's a bad book you want to know the longest book
[01:35:02.380 --> 01:35:05.260]   i'm actually listening to two really long books right now
[01:35:05.260 --> 01:35:08.220]   the rise and fall of the third Reich that's great
[01:35:08.220 --> 01:35:11.020]   that's great 57 hours it i read it when i was a kid
[01:35:11.020 --> 01:35:14.860]   not a kid but i read it in high school it's really is great how many pages is
[01:35:14.860 --> 01:35:17.420]   that like how many pages per hour can they do huge
[01:35:17.420 --> 01:35:20.860]   i don't know and then the other one i'm reading i got when i was in japan
[01:35:20.860 --> 01:35:25.980]   shogun the james clavell novel 53 hours 53 hours of one book
[01:35:25.980 --> 01:35:29.100]   that is a commitment i think that's value for money
[01:35:29.100 --> 01:35:32.700]   although i'm currently reading democracy in america by elixir tokville
[01:35:32.700 --> 01:35:36.540]   wow yeah it's all right it's a project but that's going to be more than 53 hours
[01:35:36.540 --> 01:35:39.740]   thing to get there that's impressive that's really i'm reading in english
[01:35:39.740 --> 01:35:45.260]   still good um yeah on on the on the bordane note i would
[01:35:45.260 --> 01:35:48.700]   uh i have an article to recommend it's not about the
[01:35:48.700 --> 01:35:51.740]   sponsoring thing but he brought up such like sadness and this
[01:35:51.740 --> 01:35:55.660]   was a really tough week and if you all go to medium i didn't write this
[01:35:55.660 --> 01:35:58.860]   not self-bugging but a friend did it's called when they leave
[01:35:58.860 --> 01:36:02.060]   and i think you know given our conversations about social media
[01:36:02.060 --> 01:36:05.660]   and the internet you know how we how we present publicly versus
[01:36:05.660 --> 01:36:09.420]   who we are inside and whatever turmoil we might be going through
[01:36:09.420 --> 01:36:11.980]   there's often a big gap between that and this author
[01:36:11.980 --> 01:36:16.140]   does a really good job of reminding us that we don't necessarily know
[01:36:16.140 --> 01:36:19.100]   people who we think we know uh just from their work
[01:36:19.100 --> 01:36:22.140]   and just from how they present in public and there's some good tools in
[01:36:22.140 --> 01:36:25.260]   there and suicide prevention is always something valuable to throw into
[01:36:25.260 --> 01:36:29.180]   google if you're feeling uh a little panics about you know how
[01:36:29.180 --> 01:36:32.460]   tough your life can be so just a public service announcement on
[01:36:32.460 --> 01:36:35.420]   the back to that uh because i know that was very hard for
[01:36:35.420 --> 01:36:40.140]   for many of us sarah ben and casa yes she is
[01:36:40.140 --> 01:36:43.500]   fantastic right there there's been so many beautiful things written about
[01:36:43.500 --> 01:36:47.660]   bordane on twitter and on blogs and in papers it's been fantastic just
[01:36:47.660 --> 01:36:51.740]   just i felt just better about humanity as a whole after reading just what
[01:36:51.740 --> 01:36:54.300]   he did just so many people around the world
[01:36:54.300 --> 01:36:58.140]   especially to geeks i think uh i know so many people who have pictures of
[01:36:58.140 --> 01:37:03.260]   themselves with him he was so available he really talked to people
[01:37:03.260 --> 01:37:06.140]   he reached out and i know so many people who knew him
[01:37:06.140 --> 01:37:09.820]   or at least had contact with him at one you you'd meet him in a line and he'd
[01:37:09.820 --> 01:37:16.140]   say hi post for a picture he i i really think that this is an unusual case
[01:37:16.140 --> 01:37:19.820]   yeah this is somebody perhaps because he was
[01:37:19.820 --> 01:37:23.180]   a real person often when a celebrity dies a lot of the outpouring it feels
[01:37:23.180 --> 01:37:26.140]   a bit stilted to me almost a little bit artificial yeah they're they're on a
[01:37:26.140 --> 01:37:29.420]   different planet but like bordane or is the president called him
[01:37:29.420 --> 01:37:32.700]   tony president obama i mean yeah i mean just everyone seemed to have their own
[01:37:32.700 --> 01:37:35.260]   story about him being fantastic in some way
[01:37:35.260 --> 01:37:39.420]   huge life yeah anyways google it's a good transition
[01:37:39.420 --> 01:37:43.580]   okay it's not the smoothest in the world and that's
[01:37:43.580 --> 01:37:46.860]   that's why lio has his job and i don't do this for money
[01:37:46.860 --> 01:37:50.860]   anyways google i was trying to figure out some way out of the hole that i dug
[01:37:50.860 --> 01:37:53.980]   for myself there but being all sentimental it's fine to take a little time and
[01:37:53.980 --> 01:37:57.660]   acknowledge uh his passing and uh you know and how much he meant to so many
[01:37:57.660 --> 01:38:01.420]   people anyway google there you go
[01:38:01.420 --> 01:38:04.940]   what about it uh the new gmail's well i know to all users uh next month you
[01:38:04.940 --> 01:38:08.780]   like the new gmail i'm ambivalent about it but i don't like gmail as this today
[01:38:08.780 --> 01:38:11.980]   so i'm optimistic about it making my life better you can turn it on you know if
[01:38:11.980 --> 01:38:16.140]   you want right now yeah but i hate email i don't encourage myself
[01:38:16.140 --> 01:38:19.180]   what's what's new about it you can boomerang things they come back
[01:38:19.180 --> 01:38:22.460]   it's pretty it does look a lot better it's pretty
[01:38:22.460 --> 01:38:26.140]   it's a ui upgrade it's like what craigslist refuses to do
[01:38:26.140 --> 01:38:31.180]   google is we're gonna make pluck from it i love that the craigslist still looks
[01:38:31.180 --> 01:38:35.660]   exactly as it did whenever it started 1985 whenever it
[01:38:35.660 --> 01:38:39.340]   feels it feels like that before it kills the newspapers
[01:38:39.340 --> 01:38:41.980]   oh come on so you're still bitter about that
[01:38:41.980 --> 01:38:45.900]   well they're the new gmail that they integrate calendar
[01:38:45.900 --> 01:38:50.620]   and a side panel and other plugins they let you collapse your left column with
[01:38:50.620 --> 01:38:54.380]   all of your labels and whatnot and as someone mentioned that they will
[01:38:54.380 --> 01:38:59.020]   nudge you about emails that you have let linger for a while
[01:38:59.020 --> 01:39:05.100]   and it just it is a softer you know it's curvier and smoother i don't know
[01:39:05.100 --> 01:39:07.660]   all the design language but it's just a more comfortable
[01:39:07.660 --> 01:39:10.780]   on the eyes and for a place that we all spend
[01:39:10.780 --> 01:39:15.580]   time that we'd rather have back uh i i think it's so far so good after having
[01:39:15.580 --> 01:39:19.980]   it for two days actually stopped using google gmail
[01:39:19.980 --> 01:39:24.940]   wait what how do you do mail yeah i know i know it's shocking
[01:39:24.940 --> 01:39:28.140]   just send them off her mail is that what you're on
[01:39:28.140 --> 01:39:32.540]   um i pay money for fast mail which is an i-map
[01:39:32.540 --> 01:39:37.100]   mail service i really like has all the tools i want i don't want web based mail
[01:39:37.100 --> 01:39:39.580]   to be honest i prefer to use a desktop client
[01:39:39.580 --> 01:39:43.100]   and part of it is because i use pgp signing
[01:39:43.100 --> 01:39:47.420]   oh and so i want to sign uh so if you get an email from me and it's not signed
[01:39:47.420 --> 01:39:51.260]   it's probably not me right gmail doesn't let you do that
[01:39:51.260 --> 01:39:55.420]   uh i uh i just i feel like i have a little more control on a
[01:39:55.420 --> 01:39:58.460]   desktop client than i do on a web based client so
[01:39:58.460 --> 01:40:02.380]   and gmail you can i used fast mail with gmail i mean um
[01:40:02.380 --> 01:40:06.220]   a desktop client apple mail or whatever clauses might have preferred
[01:40:06.220 --> 01:40:11.020]   with gmail for a long time but it's not it's actually impure i-map it's
[01:40:11.020 --> 01:40:14.540]   uh pseudo i-map and a real i-map client gives you i think a lot more
[01:40:14.540 --> 01:40:19.260]   capability so fast mail i used to pipe my email for a long time
[01:40:19.260 --> 01:40:23.660]   i i've been using fast mail for a decade but i would pipe gmail into fast mail
[01:40:23.660 --> 01:40:28.300]   because gmail had the spam filtering right oh yes but i've noticed i don't need it
[01:40:28.300 --> 01:40:32.380]   anymore i don't know why but uh i i actually get more spam
[01:40:32.380 --> 01:40:36.620]   because i have a french name on gmail that's the other reason i stopped see
[01:40:36.620 --> 01:40:39.180]   this is all spams it's kind of impressive actually this is good
[01:40:39.180 --> 01:40:42.300]   spam this is this is after the filtering yeah yeah
[01:40:42.300 --> 01:40:46.140]   marijuana is now legal time to confirm your email address news
[01:40:46.140 --> 01:40:48.380]   because that looks completely legitimate
[01:40:48.380 --> 01:40:52.940]   pure cbd at least they're blocking the images thank you for that google
[01:40:52.940 --> 01:40:57.100]   uh but you can do um attachment previews in the new gmail which is kind of cool
[01:40:57.100 --> 01:41:00.300]   where's that oh like that's what this button is i don't know what's underneath
[01:41:00.300 --> 01:41:03.260]   so i can go to the fat saunjang there you go
[01:41:03.260 --> 01:41:08.380]   in jvie so this is what i get a lot of french spam
[01:41:08.380 --> 01:41:12.540]   that's the best spam that's like refined spam and you should
[01:41:12.540 --> 01:41:15.020]   you should be like us a high class problem really
[01:41:15.020 --> 01:41:19.020]   spam with a good sauce look at uh
[01:41:19.020 --> 01:41:23.580]   on vaults vadie uh vanda juan the 22nd of june
[01:41:23.580 --> 01:41:29.340]   uh the group the cretans is going to perform rock
[01:41:29.340 --> 01:41:36.540]   roll group rock roll por suave tapas oh this is great i want to go
[01:41:36.540 --> 01:41:41.340]   the creeks with an apostrophe s which means they own it's a creeton
[01:41:41.340 --> 01:41:45.500]   owns the group oh yes or something and by the way
[01:41:45.500 --> 01:41:50.460]   don't you love french spam in comic sans it is it is the france of fawn
[01:41:50.460 --> 01:41:54.220]   so i agree it's a performance art spam you just don't get it
[01:41:54.220 --> 01:41:57.980]   i just i just don't get well thank god i had a preview so i don't have to
[01:41:57.980 --> 01:42:01.180]   actually open this email look i didn't design the new gmail i'm just reading
[01:42:01.180 --> 01:42:04.860]   what the article says what else do we get is oh this is the one that has
[01:42:04.860 --> 01:42:09.020]   automat has uh artificially intelligent
[01:42:09.020 --> 01:42:12.620]   responses it's called smart compose okay and i guarantee you it's not going to be
[01:42:12.620 --> 01:42:16.620]   very smart but shall we try it let me respond to somebody shall i respond
[01:42:16.620 --> 01:42:20.460]   obviously spam yes of course uh no how would you
[01:42:20.460 --> 01:42:24.060]   encourage them oh well wonder if it'll come up with anything
[01:42:24.060 --> 01:42:27.660]   all right well didn't didn't offer any choices by the way you like this is
[01:42:27.660 --> 01:42:31.340]   another reason i stopped using gmail i somehow felt compelled to have an
[01:42:31.340 --> 01:42:34.780]   html signature i'm kind of judging you for that right now
[01:42:34.780 --> 01:42:39.260]   look at this it's got all the icons for all my social media icons i feel like
[01:42:39.260 --> 01:42:43.260]   a heavy signature man oh man i think it's 40 or 50k
[01:42:43.260 --> 01:42:46.540]   i'm proud of this that's a big payload that's a lot over hit

[01:43:29.500 --> 01:43:33.820]   you know you want to i cannot believe that you went on a 35-minute rant
[01:43:33.820 --> 01:43:38.540]   against twitter and then you're promoting hashtag
[01:43:38.540 --> 01:43:43.020]   baritoneature baritoneature let's create a signature for you
[01:43:43.020 --> 01:43:47.660]   baritone day seek put all the fields in there oh this looks like the united website
[01:43:47.660 --> 01:43:50.060]   all fields of oh united website is actually it's
[01:43:50.060 --> 01:43:54.220]   that yeah i finally had you know when i hate about the united website as long
[01:43:54.220 --> 01:43:57.420]   as we're on a diatribe tell me your things for security
[01:43:57.420 --> 01:44:02.300]   they use secret questions but instead of letting you answer them with whatever
[01:44:02.300 --> 01:44:05.420]   you want which would solve the problem what are they doing today give you a
[01:44:05.420 --> 01:44:10.300]   drop down of suggested answers mom's mower's name you have to choose
[01:44:10.300 --> 01:44:14.220]   they don't do that with a favorite favorite ice cream flavor
[01:44:14.220 --> 01:44:16.940]   and then you can choose from fadilla chocolate strawberry
[01:44:16.940 --> 01:44:20.140]   it's like that's the worst security i've ever heard of
[01:44:20.140 --> 01:44:23.580]   it's a good idea set up known of publicly known combinations
[01:44:23.580 --> 01:44:27.260]   telling the hacker what to do with the kids yeah but dude the planes aren't that
[01:44:27.260 --> 01:44:30.300]   much better so it's not like the entire experience it gets any better from that
[01:44:30.300 --> 01:44:33.660]   point on to i'm flying united in about six days please don't
[01:44:33.660 --> 01:44:36.380]   spit in my food is that how you go to providence i'm going to boston this
[01:44:36.380 --> 01:44:40.540]   you go to the beautiful tf green airport you can't fly united to boston to
[01:44:40.540 --> 01:44:44.460]   providence from sfo because it's like three stops so i have to fly united to boston
[01:44:44.460 --> 01:44:46.860]   and drive that's what i always do gosh it's awful
[01:44:46.860 --> 01:44:49.500]   no it's great it's only an hour from boston to providence
[01:44:49.500 --> 01:44:52.700]   when i get off a plan you can listen to this podcast there you go
[01:44:52.700 --> 01:44:56.220]   you can use your audiobooks on the commute the problem self they used to have they
[01:44:56.220 --> 01:44:59.740]   probably don't have it anymore these special airport limos which are like
[01:44:59.740 --> 01:45:04.300]   stretch station wagons they're really long and they have like 10 windows
[01:45:04.300 --> 01:45:08.380]   going it's a station wagon that somebody put something in the middle of
[01:45:08.380 --> 01:45:12.380]   and they're really long but you get your own bench seat
[01:45:12.380 --> 01:45:15.580]   my own my own whole bench seat yeah oh my gosh
[01:45:15.580 --> 01:45:18.860]   how fantastically that's gonna solve all my problems in life we had a great
[01:45:18.860 --> 01:45:21.340]   week this week on twit and we've decided to make a small
[01:45:21.340 --> 01:45:26.140]   movie for you to enjoy in case you missed any of it watch
[01:45:26.140 --> 01:45:33.500]   previously on twit can i ask you a question yes it's june sixth why are you wearing a huge sweater
[01:45:33.500 --> 01:45:38.940]   this is like eating like um like stew in june it just feels
[01:45:38.940 --> 01:45:46.620]   feels wrong know how we've got a project that we teased actually quite a long time ago it's
[01:45:46.620 --> 01:45:51.500]   the lipi now the whole idea was to take a raspberry pie and to surround it with the
[01:45:51.500 --> 01:45:55.580]   stuff that you would need to make it portable or the stuff that you would need to make it
[01:45:55.580 --> 01:46:00.780]   uninterruptible very nice and clean nice and clean still gives me access to all the ports
[01:46:00.780 --> 01:46:05.580]   you feel better now it's ball yeah thank you that's more uh month appropriate
[01:46:05.580 --> 01:46:11.180]   and i've taken off my shoes by the way i just want you to know i i i take you seriously
[01:46:11.740 --> 01:46:19.020]   the new screen sabers this is the planet computer's gemini pd love this thing a and i think a lot of
[01:46:19.020 --> 01:46:24.060]   people laugh at me when i pull this out of my pocket but this actually could be your full-time
[01:46:24.060 --> 01:46:29.740]   phone and have a little bit more with this nice keyboard built-in it's like a uh finding
[01:46:29.740 --> 01:46:34.460]   nimo hat now we're all right i don't mean interrupt or anything i don't know it's okay i'm just
[01:46:34.460 --> 01:46:37.500]   you know you said you wanted me to dress for some time i do it to you all the time this is
[01:46:37.500 --> 01:46:45.340]   getting nice revenge fee um to it tech just like you like it i come sometime i like what you're doing
[01:46:45.340 --> 01:46:54.620]   there i like where you're going look at my youtube jerk street thug oh lordy lordy lordy anything
[01:46:54.620 --> 01:46:59.740]   that is pollinate it's gonna be fantastic Paul is a character good rule he is great so this broke
[01:46:59.740 --> 01:47:05.260]   kind of the rumor broke uh at the end of twit last week and we all kind of jumped in but uh it
[01:47:05.260 --> 01:47:13.420]   came true it came true on monday microsoft bought github for seven and a half billion dollars yeah
[01:47:13.420 --> 01:47:21.820]   baby any thoughts i mean it's not microsoft yeah so i i mean i think you you all shared some good
[01:47:21.820 --> 01:47:28.540]   links i think the harvard business review analysis was pretty good in that uh and also bring uh
[01:47:28.540 --> 01:47:36.140]   toms and i should check re who you have on often oh he's great yeah needed a way to uh keep you
[01:47:36.140 --> 01:47:41.260]   either lord developers with your access to a tremendous user base or your ability to make them
[01:47:41.260 --> 01:47:46.460]   money or you have to reach out to them directly and you know undersat in adela microsoft has been a
[01:47:46.460 --> 01:47:53.020]   very different company then under uh the screamer that came before him and their anti open source
[01:47:53.020 --> 01:47:59.820]   vibe has all but gone away and so buying github you know helps ingratiate them to developers
[01:47:59.820 --> 01:48:05.820]   helps position their tools to be used by them and can encourage some of their enterprise users to
[01:48:05.820 --> 01:48:11.340]   start using even more open source stuff so the way the business review put it said this is not
[01:48:11.340 --> 01:48:16.700]   about the financial gain that you get directly from a github is about the strategic value of
[01:48:16.700 --> 01:48:22.220]   having millions potentially of developers associated with that but that requires that
[01:48:22.220 --> 01:48:25.820]   but associated with your part of the market doesn't make a mistake of it though or hash of it i
[01:48:25.820 --> 01:48:28.860]   mean they're out there doing redder a m a is an engineering blog post trying to encourage
[01:48:28.860 --> 01:48:33.740]   developers to not worry that they're going to come and make a mess of their beloved development home
[01:48:33.740 --> 01:48:37.900]   and i think after reading a whole bunch of this it's actually kind of working which i'm a little
[01:48:37.900 --> 01:48:41.900]   bit surprised by but mike shop has gone on this you know lennox love fest they've been contributing
[01:48:41.900 --> 01:48:46.380]   to open source for years now so they maybe have the actual footing in the market to do this and
[01:48:46.380 --> 01:48:50.140]   not scare away all developers who depend on github to build things but they couldn't have done three
[01:48:50.140 --> 01:48:55.900]   years ago you know i think they've they've changed their leadership has changed and a lot of this
[01:48:55.900 --> 01:49:01.100]   stuff comes down from the top they're acting like a more grown-up company with respect to a lot of
[01:49:01.100 --> 01:49:04.780]   these things so i don't i'm not a hardcore developer like that i have a github account because i
[01:49:04.780 --> 01:49:11.420]   want to own baritone day everywhere on the internet but i do think that you know to your point alex they
[01:49:11.420 --> 01:49:15.900]   are they're behaving very differently than is in the past and i think they have a good shot
[01:49:15.900 --> 01:49:20.620]   at maintaining this uh as they have with some of their other recent acquisitions over the past
[01:49:20.620 --> 01:49:24.940]   few years you did hear from a lot of open source folks who said i will never trust mike
[01:49:24.940 --> 01:49:30.860]   rosoff there was a spike at git lab a competition uh to github uh as people move their projects
[01:49:30.860 --> 01:49:36.380]   over there one concern is perhaps legitimate i don't think it's going to be a problem but
[01:49:36.380 --> 01:49:41.900]   that's something i can understand people worried about is that uh open source developers who are
[01:49:41.900 --> 01:49:49.740]   putting their source code up on github privately for them to collaborate and work on are concerned
[01:49:49.740 --> 01:49:55.900]   that mike rosoff might peek at it and and glain you know glean some information or you know i mean
[01:49:55.900 --> 01:50:01.900]   that they could certainly the old mike rosoff wouldn't have put that you know put it i wouldn't
[01:50:01.900 --> 01:50:07.820]   put it past them the bomber era microsobama but the risk of doing that and being found out you
[01:50:07.820 --> 01:50:13.980]   destroy all good will yeah it's a massive media scandal it destroys the stock price which is
[01:50:13.980 --> 01:50:19.100]   shareholder value which is the point of the public company so they could i mean there's a lot of
[01:50:19.100 --> 01:50:23.260]   crimes we all could be committing right now but we don't because the cost is too high so i think
[01:50:23.260 --> 01:50:29.020]   that's a potential but it seems really unlikely and super stupid for them to even enable a system
[01:50:29.020 --> 01:50:33.340]   where they could do that like a rogue employee probably wouldn't be able to do that if they
[01:50:33.340 --> 01:50:37.180]   wouldn't have paid so much money if they i think if they weren't convinced that they could convince
[01:50:37.180 --> 01:50:41.420]   open source developers that it was safe to stay on github one of the things they did that was right
[01:50:41.420 --> 01:50:47.980]   they appointed nat friedman as a CEO of github he came to microsoft from an open source project he
[01:50:47.980 --> 01:50:55.820]   and megal de akaza founded simian uh and he was uh so he's been an open source developer nat has
[01:50:55.820 --> 01:51:00.780]   since he left mit he's got good street cred he was the guy who did they ask me anything and he
[01:51:00.780 --> 01:51:06.940]   did ventilously well in that a m a real yeah he said there will never be ads uh you know on
[01:51:06.940 --> 01:51:13.180]   github on public repositories of code i'm sure that reassured a lot of people that is i think
[01:51:13.180 --> 01:51:17.580]   well liked in the community so i hope it does work out because frankly github i think would not
[01:51:17.580 --> 01:51:21.100]   have been long for this world had they not been acquired well there was a lot of different numbers
[01:51:21.100 --> 01:51:25.260]   out there about their income and law statements and the most reasonably reporting we had was some
[01:51:25.260 --> 01:51:29.820]   numbers in 2016 in which they were losing tens of millions of dollars i think a quarter at that
[01:51:29.820 --> 01:51:34.300]   point in time but they raised a total of 350 uh million that we know of throughout their history
[01:51:34.300 --> 01:51:39.900]   and they were worth at least two billion uh seven and a half billion so they had a fantastic return
[01:51:39.900 --> 01:51:44.060]   for their investors and if you got in when andrewson horwitz did back when they were worth about
[01:51:44.060 --> 01:51:49.180]   750 million you got 10x probably on your money a little bit more so for investors it's a great
[01:51:49.180 --> 01:51:54.140]   outcome for developers github will now live right mike's looking afford to feed it it's a great
[01:51:54.140 --> 01:51:59.260]   resource i mean i have to say it is but there but also the free software foundation is long time
[01:51:59.260 --> 01:52:04.780]   complained about github because some of their code is open some of it's not open uh you know some
[01:52:04.780 --> 01:52:11.020]   of it so there's been some questionable practices i think at github there was in the me too movement
[01:52:11.020 --> 01:52:15.980]   there were some talk about management at github so there were some issues yeah i mean i wrote that
[01:52:15.980 --> 01:52:21.340]   story about um the woman who reported sexual harassment from the then cio pressed in warner or
[01:52:21.340 --> 01:52:26.060]   something like that you got with some fire i think yeah it was back in 2014 yeah so that's kind of
[01:52:26.060 --> 01:52:30.700]   ancient history now in startup uh terms but yeah i mean it's good to see a company that was notorious
[01:52:30.700 --> 01:52:36.940]   for not being exactly well managed to find a home that's going to be uh of correct base size to
[01:52:36.940 --> 01:52:41.180]   support its importance in the software world micro stuff will never make seven and a half billion
[01:52:41.180 --> 01:52:45.500]   back however this is this is uh this is not but they've not why they bought it they didn't buy it
[01:52:45.500 --> 01:52:49.180]   for that they bought it for good seven and a half billion dollars with a good will which is what
[01:52:49.180 --> 01:52:52.860]   they'll put on their balance sheet but also google didn't get to buy it because microsoft
[01:52:52.860 --> 01:52:56.860]   politics kept it at a google so keep in mind there's competitive strategic acquisition
[01:52:56.860 --> 01:53:02.620]   yeah interesting interesting yes ben thompson's article on the cost of developers is actually
[01:53:02.620 --> 01:53:09.980]   really good it actually even involves uh wwdc as well and he talks about the issue
[01:53:09.980 --> 01:53:16.780]   uh of aggregators versus platforms this is one of his hobby horse he loves to beat on this one so
[01:53:17.340 --> 01:53:27.020]   a platform in his definition is something that developers can leverage to create something new
[01:53:27.020 --> 01:53:32.620]   so the classic platform is windows well he is build gates apparently defined it as a platform
[01:53:32.620 --> 01:53:36.540]   is something where the where the people who are coming to your platform make more money than the
[01:53:36.540 --> 01:53:42.060]   new dude yeah yeah so it's a good a good line windows was a good example of this in fact
[01:53:42.060 --> 01:53:45.740]   i think the personal computing revolution really owes a debt of gratitude to microsoft
[01:53:46.700 --> 01:53:52.460]   i mean there were believe me there were stumbles but by creating a stable solid platform for people
[01:53:52.460 --> 01:53:59.420]   to write software on the 90s were powered by microsoft soft software written for microsoft windows
[01:53:59.420 --> 01:54:05.020]   i don't think that i think that's a good thing in the in the overall you know long term of this
[01:54:05.020 --> 01:54:09.820]   aggregators are something a little different google is a classic aggregator they harvest
[01:54:10.860 --> 01:54:16.780]   already produced content or goods to make money off of them and i don't have a place in the market
[01:54:16.780 --> 01:54:22.620]   but in this case a platform is the more powerful of the two right and uh he's quick to point out
[01:54:22.620 --> 01:54:30.300]   that while you might think that ios and the app store is a platform it's not apples 30% out of every
[01:54:30.300 --> 01:54:38.860]   sale really makes them an aggregator much more so than a platform and uh so he i think it's a
[01:54:38.860 --> 01:54:44.220]   voice he is he is astute and i'm probably not going to be able to do a great job of summarizing this
[01:54:44.220 --> 01:54:52.140]   but he said that the seven and a half billion that microsoft uh paid for github is absolutely
[01:54:52.140 --> 01:54:59.340]   critical for you know he said the github revenue is not the point microsoft has plenty of revenue
[01:54:59.340 --> 01:55:04.780]   but it also has a potentially fatal weakness no platform with user based leverage
[01:55:05.740 --> 01:55:09.500]   microsoft's betting that the future of open source cloud based applications that exist
[01:55:09.500 --> 01:55:13.500]   independent of platforms will be a large and increasing share of the future that everything
[01:55:13.500 --> 01:55:18.140]   microsoft's done over the last three years under such an adela has been all about that the transition
[01:55:18.140 --> 01:55:29.740]   away from selling software from making windows to becoming what uh a cloud service provider
[01:55:29.740 --> 01:55:34.780]   is services provider that has a cloud base to it i mean the azure is a pillar of the
[01:55:34.780 --> 01:55:39.500]   the businesses you know next 15 20 years and they're trying to build up their developer tooling so they
[01:55:39.500 --> 01:55:45.100]   have a huge person to that market share and they sell services that they've always have like office
[01:55:45.100 --> 01:55:51.180]   and um windows fits in there as an accelerant but not the uh the core hub he says any company
[01:55:51.180 --> 01:55:55.740]   ben bender's with the platform with a meaningful amount of users would find it very hard to resist
[01:55:55.740 --> 01:56:00.220]   the temptation to use github as leverage and that's what people are afraid microsoft will do but
[01:56:00.220 --> 01:56:04.700]   that's the old microsoft on the other side of the spectrum purely enterprise focused companies say
[01:56:04.700 --> 01:56:09.980]   i b m or oracle would be tempted to ring every possible bit of profit out of the company what
[01:56:09.980 --> 01:56:17.020]   microsoft wants is much fuzzier it wants to be developers friend in large heart because and
[01:56:17.020 --> 01:56:21.900]   this is really critical to understanding where microsoft is today it has no other option in the
[01:56:21.900 --> 01:56:26.380]   long run particularly as windows continues to fade the company will be ever more invested in a
[01:56:26.380 --> 01:56:32.540]   world with no geek gatekeepers where developer tools and clouds win by be better on merits
[01:56:32.540 --> 01:56:39.340]   not be i bit by being able to leverage users i think that's really astute and very exciting
[01:56:39.340 --> 01:56:43.740]   that's a future i want to live in it sounds good it sounds very developer friendly which means
[01:56:43.740 --> 01:56:47.740]   good software which means we the end users will do well one thing that's brought up though that i
[01:56:47.740 --> 01:56:51.580]   thought was really interesting uh in this article another one he did on this was the number of
[01:56:51.580 --> 01:56:56.220]   developers in the world and some numbers that bend sites including one from idc that there are
[01:56:56.220 --> 01:57:02.460]   21 million developers worldwide wow but uh there's way more github accounts than that an apple during
[01:57:02.460 --> 01:57:07.500]   the adc said there was like over 20 million ios developers so one thing that i'm loving to watch
[01:57:07.500 --> 01:57:11.580]   over the last week is who's right how many developers are there and the answer is i've
[01:57:11.580 --> 01:57:15.020]   absolutely no well you could certainly create as baritone did a github account just to keep
[01:57:15.020 --> 01:57:19.580]   your name you can create it if you're a writer a philip i know a lot of writers who actually use
[01:57:20.140 --> 01:57:26.220]   software like get code repositories to put their writing online yeah for sure uh so it doesn't have
[01:57:26.220 --> 01:57:32.700]   to be code exact exactly i have a github account but i don't put anything up there so well also what
[01:57:32.700 --> 01:57:37.180]   developer means is squishy right i mean what your definition is not gonna be exactly mine if i make
[01:57:37.180 --> 01:57:44.620]   a shortcut when i was i think i was a so your using series shortcuts congratulations everybody
[01:57:44.620 --> 01:57:48.860]   wants someday everybody'll be a developer let's take a quick break and then the last thing i want
[01:57:48.860 --> 01:57:55.900]   to talk about is computex big taiwan uh uh could put her show where all the new pcs get announced
[01:57:55.900 --> 01:58:00.540]   intel announced something interesting and fudge the fact it's a little bit
[01:58:00.540 --> 01:58:06.540]   we'll talk about that in just a second but first a word about my doorbell the ring video doorbell
[01:58:06.540 --> 01:58:11.900]   which i'm a huge fan i mean one of the things we say all the time here is if you're going to get
[01:58:11.900 --> 01:58:16.700]   an iot device a device that's connected to the internet you better darn well buy it from somebody
[01:58:16.700 --> 01:58:23.420]   who stands behind it will continue to update the software fixed security flaws and a device that
[01:58:23.420 --> 01:58:30.140]   can be automatically updated the ring doorbell is exactly that in fact it was about a year ago that
[01:58:30.140 --> 01:58:33.900]   there was a security flaw discovered kind of a minor one with a ring doorbell if somebody took
[01:58:33.900 --> 01:58:41.180]   your doorbell they could extract your Wi-Fi log in from it and before it was revealed in public
[01:58:41.180 --> 01:58:47.580]   ring was notified fixed it and it pushed out of fix so nobody was ever exposed to that flaw
[01:58:47.580 --> 01:58:53.100]   that's what you want you want a secure device at your front door a device that makes your house
[01:58:53.100 --> 01:58:59.020]   more secure it lets you see and speak to intruders or anybody in front of your house
[01:58:59.020 --> 01:59:03.500]   from your doorbell when they ring the doorbell you can answer it you can say hi i'm not here
[01:59:03.500 --> 01:59:08.940]   actually probably shouldn't say hi i'm not here she probably say hi i'm in the bathtub i'll be
[01:59:08.940 --> 01:59:14.140]   right there with my shotgun actually i do this i do this all the time with ups i say i'm in the
[01:59:14.140 --> 01:59:17.980]   bathtub i can't sign but i'll sign tomorrow leave it at the front porch and then you can keep an eye
[01:59:17.980 --> 01:59:24.220]   on your package even if you're across the world somewhere else in the world mike elgin who does
[01:59:24.220 --> 01:59:29.660]   he's of course a regular on shows and spends a lot of time at air b&b brings a ring video doorbell
[01:59:29.660 --> 01:59:35.420]   with him and puts it on the front door wherever he stays he says it's the best thing you could do
[01:59:35.420 --> 01:59:41.740]   to keep your your yourself safe and know what's going on outside ring also makes the spotlight
[01:59:41.740 --> 01:59:48.300]   cam which is basically the camera the hd camera the speaker the microphone no doorbell because it
[01:59:48.300 --> 01:59:53.820]   goes on led spotlights you've seen those people's houses we go back around the side with the garbage
[01:59:53.820 --> 01:59:57.740]   doesn't then and they sense the motion that lights up it does all that although i have to say these
[01:59:57.740 --> 02:00:03.580]   are led lights so you never change the bulb they're really bright and then with the camera you get
[02:00:03.580 --> 02:00:08.300]   a motion activated camera and floodlight it's connecting to your phone anybody goes back there
[02:00:08.300 --> 02:00:14.380]   you'll see immediately it'll set off an alarm if you want 110 db alarm so if they don't run away
[02:00:14.380 --> 02:00:19.900]   when you say what are you doing back there it's push the alarm button and they're running i think
[02:00:19.900 --> 02:00:25.340]   ring has really done a good thing to make communities safer they today they have a
[02:00:25.340 --> 02:00:31.260]   ring neighborhood program they gave ring doorbells to one in ten houses in a in a town in southern
[02:00:31.260 --> 02:00:36.780]   california cut crime by almost 50 percent just by having every tenth house have a doorbell
[02:00:36.780 --> 02:00:40.540]   criminals said we're we're staying away from i i think it was ocean side we're staying away
[02:00:40.540 --> 02:00:46.220]   we're not going anywhere near them ring is so great too i love looking at the ring twitter

[02:02:11.820 --> 02:02:17.340]   is uh you get to know when the cleaning ladies have left and you can come back home that's actually
[02:02:17.340 --> 02:02:21.100]   one of the ways that you use it like oh they're gone it is really awkward to be in your house
[02:02:21.100 --> 02:02:26.060]   when someone else is cleaning it i don't know why but i just i feel so bad so i don't think i'm
[02:02:26.060 --> 02:02:30.140]   telling tales out of school when lisa was in college she cleaned houses to help pay for her
[02:02:30.140 --> 02:02:35.020]   tuition and she said she didn't like it when the owners stuck around she felt like they were
[02:02:35.020 --> 02:02:39.420]   snooping on her they're hovering so it's not just you everybody just get out of the house i just
[02:02:39.420 --> 02:02:46.140]   can't pet at star buska moron anyways so now you know you just look at the ring video doorbell
[02:02:46.140 --> 02:02:49.420]   you'll know when they're gone you get actually get a notification when they leave which is even
[02:02:49.420 --> 02:02:57.980]   better you don't have to watch so copy text taiwan uh intel announced a 50th anniversary product
[02:02:57.980 --> 02:03:08.300]   they call it the i7 80 86 get it it's a five gigahertz coffee lake except whoa wait a minute
[02:03:09.260 --> 02:03:18.060]   turns out it was overclocked and nitrogen cooled to get to five gigahertz and until neglected to
[02:03:18.060 --> 02:03:22.700]   mention that how did they get found out ah that's a good that's a good question because that's a
[02:03:22.700 --> 02:03:27.740]   pretty embarrassing thing to do to show off you know essentially a a new stake in the market to kind
[02:03:27.740 --> 02:03:35.340]   of be back amd's uh competitive edge yeah and uh to be lying really undercuts your uh your PR especially
[02:03:36.060 --> 02:03:45.020]   uh as your 50th anniversary microprocessor um it is a a k processor so it can actually somebody's
[02:03:45.020 --> 02:03:51.660]   up overclocked it i think to 7.2 gigahertz why didn't they announce that yeah it's way better
[02:03:51.660 --> 02:03:58.300]   live big as long as you're uh as long as you're doing it wait did you just make a tharinose joke
[02:03:58.300 --> 02:04:02.860]   i did i said go tharinose or go home like if you're that's that's the best thing i've heard all week
[02:04:02.860 --> 02:04:09.020]   right there it's our new 7.2 4 gigahertz processor i'm always up for a tharinose check in wow did
[02:04:09.020 --> 02:04:13.740]   you see i don't know if this is apocryphal that alisabeth homes is now going out looking for new
[02:04:13.740 --> 02:04:17.740]   investments on a new stir we read that in vanity fair on the way over here on our ferry right
[02:04:17.740 --> 02:04:21.900]   nick builtin yik builtin so when we said right can you believe that yes i can believe that i live
[02:04:21.900 --> 02:04:27.020]   in silicon valley i vet these people you know i guess the way old tharinose or go big i think
[02:04:27.020 --> 02:04:34.140]   you're exactly right oh yeah yeah or go home sorry entologist this is why i let you do you're
[02:04:34.140 --> 02:04:41.980]   the words smith baritone it's our work team leo's cool okay amd not to be uh left out announced a 32
[02:04:41.980 --> 02:04:49.180]   core processor they call it the the thread ripper just a heavy metal name for a bit of silicon just
[02:04:49.180 --> 02:04:54.620]   you know call it konan and be done with it uh the the 32 we don't know how much it'll cost
[02:04:55.260 --> 02:05:00.460]   availability later this year that's as close as they're gonna uh get but that's pretty amazing
[02:05:00.460 --> 02:05:06.540]   a 32 core you know i i bet you that slack and chrome will still be able to bring any computer
[02:05:06.540 --> 02:05:13.260]   running 32 cores to a complete stand now you know why i use edge okay no matter what uh mac or windows
[02:05:13.260 --> 02:05:18.620]   computer that i'm on no matter how powerful it is chrome slack and spotify can literally turn it
[02:05:18.620 --> 02:05:24.060]   into fudge and that's talking to me so 32 cores whatever it'll still be terrible this is my favorite
[02:05:24.060 --> 02:05:34.140]   product announced this is an asus zenbook pro 15 with a screen where the trackpad ought to be
[02:05:34.140 --> 02:05:44.300]   so the idea is you could use it as a trackpad or you could have it do other stuff you could
[02:05:44.300 --> 02:05:49.180]   have a little calculator app running there you could hear let me show the the video it's pretty
[02:05:49.180 --> 02:05:56.460]   wild this is the zenbook pro it's not available yet um you could get settings in there this is
[02:05:56.460 --> 02:06:01.340]   your trackpad right you could if you're watching a youtube video you could have the play controls
[02:06:01.340 --> 02:06:07.740]   there so it's like a touch pad instead of a touch bar yes just about to say it's much like
[02:06:07.740 --> 02:06:11.100]   the but the difference is the apple touch you're already got your fingers on the touch
[02:06:11.100 --> 02:06:15.500]   trackpad so well everyone loves the touch bar so much this must be a great idea
[02:06:16.780 --> 02:06:24.700]   they just watch videos down there yeah so while you're doing the spreadsheet you can watch your
[02:06:24.700 --> 02:06:28.460]   favorite videos so to be clear they put a pc in your pc so you can
[02:06:28.460 --> 02:06:36.140]   that's an old name bring it back throwback name i love it you get points for that no but like
[02:06:36.140 --> 02:06:40.860]   literally they had though the windows start bar on the touchpad screen and one that picture
[02:06:40.860 --> 02:06:45.740]   should be a second screen oh i kind of like that now i like to i like how you can play one screen
[02:06:45.740 --> 02:06:50.540]   and i struggle with my lot to only have one screen oh i hate that i like this all right
[02:06:50.540 --> 02:06:55.180]   it's five and a half inches wow yeah it's pretty big
[02:06:55.180 --> 02:07:01.900]   ladies and gentlemen i hear that dinner is almost ready in the thirst in household
[02:07:01.900 --> 02:07:06.620]   what is for dinner baritone day no idea it smells good
[02:07:07.340 --> 02:07:13.340]   yeah it does what what's your girlfriend cooking that is uh between me and her can you
[02:07:13.340 --> 02:07:18.620]   smell what baritone day's cooking can you smell it mmm mmm the answer is yes and i have to add
[02:07:18.620 --> 02:07:24.460]   a layer of security to my home well i'm gonna let you go eat it we want to tell everybody to
[02:07:24.460 --> 02:07:31.260]   read baritone days manifesto i think it really is is right on it's on uh medium
[02:07:31.260 --> 02:07:36.620]   or you could just go to baritone day dot com and get links to both his posts the new tech manifesto
[02:07:36.620 --> 02:07:45.740]   and his 800 step detox it's hey let's be fair it's not easy but hey somebody's got to do it right
[02:07:45.740 --> 02:07:50.780]   and then i did it i did it for y'all i'm also i'm experimenting with another way for people to
[02:07:50.780 --> 02:07:56.700]   connect with me which is not on a public social platform it's on a uh via sms i'm just putting
[02:07:56.700 --> 02:08:02.300]   my number out there what it's a public number no don't what do you use the phrase calls are you
[02:08:02.300 --> 02:08:07.260]   a charge people for that no no no this is this is an experiment so i'm not going to charge you
[02:08:07.260 --> 02:08:16.380]   for me to learn i will we'll do this together but that number is 202 902 7949 and if you send a
[02:08:16.380 --> 02:08:22.140]   text with hashtag twit then i'll be able to know how you came through and i plan to use it to
[02:08:22.140 --> 02:08:27.740]   announce when i have big articles or appearances right now if i'm doing live events in your area
[02:08:27.740 --> 02:08:32.060]   you can share information with me about you as much as you're comfortable i just definitely
[02:08:32.060 --> 02:08:37.340]   need a name and an email and we can have one-on-one conversation which i found over the past few weeks
[02:08:37.340 --> 02:08:43.500]   it's actually really different and interesting from mailing list which is all broadcast or twitter
[02:08:43.500 --> 02:08:48.460]   facebook which is kind of performative and so i'm learning a lot i'm able to talk to people
[02:08:48.460 --> 02:08:57.260]   more of a conversational mode so again 202 902 7949 just text hashtag twit and we'll we'll play around
[02:08:57.260 --> 02:09:03.900]   do you are you using some sort of hardware or an sms box or something to it's a it's a platform
[02:09:03.900 --> 02:09:10.060]   called super phone and i know the the creator and we actually went to college together when he he
[02:09:10.060 --> 02:09:15.500]   initially the first version he built himself on rails and he stitched together like google voice
[02:09:15.500 --> 02:09:23.180]   and mailchimp and twillio now he's gotten a bit more fun include from bit works and uh it's
[02:09:23.900 --> 02:09:28.540]   enabled for it was designed he's a musician he wanted to have a deeper relationship with
[02:09:28.540 --> 02:09:35.340]   his fans and customers but now they have different cases for um i want to do this right
[02:09:35.340 --> 02:09:40.700]   and there's so again this is not this isn't an exactly an endorsement i keep using the word
[02:09:40.700 --> 02:09:45.660]   experiment because i don't know how well this is going to play out or how well it scales but i am
[02:09:45.660 --> 02:09:51.100]   you know putting it out there for for folks to learn and you can always opt out and i have i'm
[02:09:51.660 --> 02:09:55.180]   not going to sell all your stuff not going to make targeted at to creep you out about what your
[02:09:55.180 --> 02:10:00.460]   kids are up to i think your super phone because i haven't gotten a response back it's been five
[02:10:00.460 --> 02:10:06.140]   it's actually it has a time delay built in so uh you're you're probably doing fine
[02:10:06.140 --> 02:10:13.020]   baritone d are you requiring real names i am not requiring real man nobody i have your phone number
[02:10:13.020 --> 02:10:16.300]   i have no way of knowing what your real name is i do get your phone number if you want to use a
[02:10:16.300 --> 02:10:20.860]   burner you know what he yeah i went i went and bought a burner phone just so i get the next
[02:10:20.860 --> 02:10:28.380]   date number you get the number i i ask because uh on on my comments remind cistern real names
[02:10:28.380 --> 02:10:33.340]   and it's just it gets rid of all the the junk you know when people are using the

[02:14:00.220 --> 02:14:04.940]   on the stuff that's exclusive you do that very cleverly so you eventually get access to everything
[02:14:04.940 --> 02:14:09.420]   everything's free eventually if you want it sooner you pay a little which makes you want to if you
[02:14:09.420 --> 02:14:13.980]   want it in your inbox and if you want to participate in the comment stream unlike what someone said
