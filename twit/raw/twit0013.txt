[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.760]   [Music]
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:26.000]   Here we go. This is Twit, this week in Tech, episode 13 for Sunday, July 10th, 2005.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   Hello ladies and gentlemen, I'm Patrick Norton, Leo the Port is flying back from Europe,
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:38.000]   joining me on the show today. We've got Kevin Rose, David Prager, and Roger Chang.
[00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   Hello. Gentlemen, Kevin, I'm going to let you start because you're in the process of dealing with a little upgraded dig
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   and I think you're going to have to bow out pretty fast.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   Yes, yes, I have to take off in just a few minutes.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   Yes, well basically we're getting ready to turn Dig 2.0 live, which is the little side I work on the side.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   I'm having some problems. It's actually quite a process to move from one server to multiple machines now.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   Not only that, but adding a ton of features and a new design.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   There's issues and there's tons of people trying to access the site right now.
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   It's just one of those things you kind of have to handle.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   I'm going to try and fix these bugs and hopefully we won't have too much downtime.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   I would imagine if it's down by the time this podcast gets heard, that's doing pretty bad.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   Well, it depends. The DNS has to propagate because we're moving to a whole other bank of servers.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   The downtime could be anywhere from a couple hours to maybe a year or two,
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   depending on how quickly their DNS updates go.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   What else have you been up to this weekend, Kevin?
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   House hunting. Actually, what does this cause? It's Marin Dam?
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   It's Marin County. I was in San Francisco all week in long, enjoying the good food and looking for a house.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   I think we found a four bedroom house.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Myself, Ron, Dan, and Keith are...
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Party house.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Party house.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Yeah, well, no. Well, there will be some partying, but...
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   Are you going to be producing, I guess, system up here and what else is going on, Kevin?
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Yeah, basically, once we nail down our living arrangement, we're going to start looking for a studio.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   And just open up a small little studio, you know, nothing too fancy and start producing shows of the broken in system
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   and maybe a couple other little tiny things.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   And that'll be about it. That's when we are full-time gig and that and I'll be working on Diggs
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   and doing other podcast type stuff. So, keeps us busy.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   No, I think there's a picture of the front door of the studio on Kevin's mobile app right now.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Oh, yeah, I won't buy the old tech TV. No, there is. I won't buy the old tech TV studios.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   No, no, I'm just making a joke. It's not the new studio.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   No, no, no, no. We don't have one. Yeah, next try. You're going to get all these people fired up.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   The second I took a picture of the tech TV studios, people were like, "Yes, get it, guys, buy it."
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Do you really think I could afford the tech TV studio?
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Hey, that can't be more than a $4 million building or, you know, $35,000 a month in rent.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   I wonder what the lease was per month on those studios. What do you guys think?
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Probably a lot. I have no idea. I don't know. How many square feet is it? It was pretty big.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   It was a pretty big warehouse. Dad in the head two floors and all the power and all the stuff I had to do.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Does anyone know if it's even being used for anything?
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   I believe it was sublet out last time. I was by there when they had subletted out.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   That's too expensive of a piece of real estate to leave empty unless you have to.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   For sure.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Actually, we should also point out that as of this point, as far as we know, the rights to tech TV
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   and the screen savers are all owned by somebody who's not going to sell it much less to us that we could afford it.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   We can't afford it and they're not selling it anyway.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Somebody keeps hitting my email with that question.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   I figure I get that information out there. Kevin?
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   I get it all the time.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   You should buy this. Great. If you have that much money, let's retire.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Exactly.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   Sorry. Perhaps I'm being selfish. Kevin, good luck with the server migration.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Thanks guys. Sorry.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   Before you go, Kevin, since Dig is down and you're not able to look at the top stories on Dig,
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   do you have any off the top of your head?
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   Oh man. I don't know. Without Dig, I'm lost.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   What was I going to bring to the table today? Let me think.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   We're going to talk about the BitTorrent add-ins too.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   That's actually pretty cool. The fact they're adding BitTorrent into Firefox.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   Opera. That's going to be awesome.
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   I think you can get it now. I haven't touched it.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   I think according to what I see online right now.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   The latest beta, I think it was, had it already integrated.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   The top are still paid for.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   They have a free version, but I know they also have, like,
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   that's how they make their money. They have a pro version or something like that.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   Let's check it out.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Very nice.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Well, I'm going to jump off guys. Thanks again.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   I will see you next week for sure. I'll be back in LA and on the podcast.
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   BitTorrent is being added to Opera. Is BitTorrent mainstream at this point?
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   You know, it's funny because I know a lot of people who've heard it,
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   still don't know what it is exactly.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   You know, has something to do with file sharing, but beyond that,
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   it's something they see in the news.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   It's where all that illegal stuff comes from, which is not true.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   You're on the statistics somewhere. Not that long ago. I'm not sure where,
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   but it said something about a pretty significant percentage of Internet traffic is BitTorrent.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   But at the same time, a pretty small percentage of Internet users, web users,
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   actually use BitTorrent.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Because of those people that do are basically using it for massive file transfers.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   That would make sense. I mean, there's also, there's lies, there's damn lies,
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   and there are statistics.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   I thought that was an Al Franken book.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   I think it's a much older phrase than...
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   I think Ben Franklin, wasn't it?
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   I mean, BitTorrent, so usually, you know, if you're downloading a video
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   or something, they're gigantic files.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   I mean, but they say, I mean, 30 or 40 percent, or I've seen the estimates as high as 70 percent of email traffic is spam.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   So...
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Yeah, that's too bad. That's terrible.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   I believe it because 70 percent of the emails I get on, at least one of my accounts are spam.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   So...
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Yeah, it's...
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Now with, you know, with Opera having BitTorrent in...
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   People having, you know, before, you know, BitTorrent was something that only, you know, a few...
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   Few people in the general computing populace would have known about and used to its full extent.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   You know, people would download ShareXHour or Zarius to use it, but now that it's in something as mainstream as a web browser,
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   that, you know, I think the number of people that will be kind of in the position of downloading stuff, I think, would be increased
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   and then put more pressure on those companies.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   For example, record companies or movie studios just kind of push for even stricter kind of interpretations
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   or perhaps even bringing harsher cases against people just to kind of make the whole stamp on that, you know,
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   just because Opera does allow for this, doesn't mean that you should be trading around in copyrighted material.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   Well, yeah, but we shall also point out that there's nothing illegal about BitTorrent inherently.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   But was it the whole peer-piercing also? Well, you know, we just make the software that allows people to...
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   Well, the Supreme Court, I can tell you haven't listened to last week's TWIT, Roger, because the Supreme Court decision,
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   but you could have downloaded it this week.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   The Supreme Court decision was essentially that one of the things they did was send it down to a lower course to talk about
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   whether or not Grogster at all were inducing people to pirate copyrighted materials.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   And that was one of the big elements in the case.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   The thing they said made it different from, say, the Betamax decision was that they were inducing people
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   to commit copyright infringement. Download free music.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   Well, kid, you know, when you're saying get anything for free, right, what's kind of a shame is that they didn't...
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   they didn't really set down a standard or a rule or a rule of thumb or whatever you call it when the Supreme Court
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   tells you how to figure something out on what inducement might be.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   So that's going to be hammered out in the lower courts and who knows it may even come back up to the Supreme Court again.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   I wonder if it's going to be with the different justices or two justices?
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Yeah. Well, there's going to be at least one different justice because Senator O'Connor's gone.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   We've got a favor for everybody out there in the TWIT land.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   One, we're going to ask you for a couple weeks to try using iTunes to get the podcast to subscribe for the main MP3 feed
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   because it is bookmarkable now and should work much, much faster than the AAC feed.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   So you should know that MP3/8, which last I checked, is now bookmarkable inside of iTunes.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   And we're going to play around some more with that to make sure it's enabled.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   And two, do us a favor and vote for us on podcast alley.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   I wonder how they, I mean, the rankings on podcast alley are all voter based.
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   Is there any way or anyone who tries to actually do a ranking based on like number, like some kind of torrent tracking or some?
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   Well, in theory, that's what's-
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   I was really see it was getting downloaded.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   Right. Nobody's, there's no, there's no Nielsen ratings for podcasts.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   And that's one of the interesting things about iTunes 4.9 adding in the tracking, Adam ranking is in theory.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   They should be doing it based on the number of iTunes clients that are subscribing.
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   So.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   Because I mean, I don't hear someone like, you know, I reflect on his science Friday, the podcast.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   And he, you know, he doesn't say, "Hey, go to podcast alley and vote for us."
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   But if he did, probably make a difference.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   Yeah. It's interesting.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   I think I had used to do a Newton's Apple and PBS.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   I don't know. I don't know.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   Because that name sounds very familiar.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   But I wonder if, I wonder if Opera is popular enough to the extent to make a difference in BitTorrent usage,
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   as I'm sure iTunes is and will continue to be making on podcast use.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   Hmm.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   Now, I would probably say yes, if it was Mozilla doing it.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   Yeah.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   According to, according to the Opera.com and their press release about their new BitTorrent client,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   which is definitely a beta, which you can download now, they say that when they launched Opera 8 in April,
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   they had a massive response with more than 100 downloads per second.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   So.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   Yeah. Well, it's interesting.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   One of the things Opera maintains is that they are underrepresented in the counts of people using non-IE browsers,
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   because they are, in fact, they show up as IE when they're logged into a server.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   That's part of what they do.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   So.
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   I know, I just went, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I just, I
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   I know, I just went, I just, I just, I just, I just tapped over to the Opera side and I just noticed the guy they have on the front for Opera 8.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   He's wearing a Power Rangers costume.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   [Laughter]
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:22.000]   I'm sorry, I just can't stop it.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   Oh man. Have you guys heard of Windiz Update?
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   Windiz Update.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   Oh, this is really cool. So the idea is that they've set it up.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   You know how you go to do Windows Update if you're in Mozilla, that you can't do Windows Update because it's not Internet Explorer?
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   So what happens with Windows Update is the idea is it's essentially a tweak so that you can update your Microsoft XP system using Mozilla
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   and not have to run Internet Explorer to do so.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   Oh, nice.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   Yeah.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   That's only for XP.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   What's that?
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   No, because it'll actually work with like 98, ME, NT4O and Windows 95, they claim.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   Are they still support? Windows 95.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   I could be terribly wrong, so I don't even know if I should use Windows.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   No, no, no. What the Windows Update people are saying is it works on Windows versions that are no longer supported by Microsoft.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   Oh, nice.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   Does that mean you can get updates, security updates for Windows that's not supported by Microsoft?
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   What it does is actually, you know, I'm going to plug into it right here and see what happens, pick updates.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   So, la, la, la, la. So if you hear a horrible crashing noise, it's not going to be killing Leo's computer by trying to update it using a...
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   Does that mean our VoIP would actually kick off?
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   No, the VoIP will still be going.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   It's on a different machine I take it.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   Yeah, yeah, so I'm going to have to update the version of...
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   I'm going to have to tweak this to do it, but it's actually I'm going to be playing around with this week.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   The thing that was interesting is, do you guys hear about Google winning the typo squatting dispute this week?
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   Yeah, so I was just reading that this morning.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   I thought that was kind of funny because, you know, how many times does someone mistype something in the...
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   for an address and come up to like something that, "Oh, yeah, that looks like it, but it's not."
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   It's, you know, cool to thought that, you know, you could sue for people being klepsy.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   Well, it's also, they're not suing because of people being klepsy.
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   They're suing because, you know, a guy in St. Petersburg, Russia bought the rights to mistyped, you know, Google names...
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   And was using that to basically put some nasty malicious software on their computers if they would click "Yes" on that.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   So the National Arbitration Forum, which is something I've never heard of before I read this article,
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   decided in Google's favor.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   So it's going to be interesting to see, you know, if those domains get handed over and what actually happens next.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   National Arbitration Forum.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   A legal alternate to litigating in court.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   It sounds so legal, but I bet you it's some guy in the like, in office, like on some like, straight...
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   some like, you know, back alleyway.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   I shouldn't say that.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   It'll come after me.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   [laughter]
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   Now, I actually have a question for you to kind of segue from that, you know, during the whole recent, you know,
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   London bombing thing, a lot of those pictures that news sources got were basically from camera phones.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   People got stuck in the subway and were unable to, you know, communicate other to their cell phone.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   They were taking all these pictures.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   I mean, I think that's kind of an interesting way that people have taken a product that most people have seen.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   It's kind of superfluous.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   Or kind of, you know, a fun gadget and using it to a more constructive or perhaps a more, you know, serious role.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   Yeah, I think it was definitely cool.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   And it's just because that much of a higher percentage of people had a certain type of recording device with them,
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   not just audio, but like video and photo that they might not normally have had in the past.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   I mean, like, you know, even five years ago, you needed, you know, you would have eyewitness accounts and they would tell you
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   if they couldn't really show you.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   And now you have like this one guy showing like people clawing at the windows of the subway car trying to get out.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   I mean, it's- You got to admire somebody having the presence of mind to, you know, you know, sort of step back.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:17.000]   I remember being in a really funny moment with a rugby player a long time ago who wasn't very bright,
[00:15:17.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   charming young man, but not very bright.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   And the elevator stopped between levels and he basically panicked.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   And the second stage of this six foot four inch tall 240 pound guy panicking was going,
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   "Everybody, don't talk. We're going to run on oxygen."
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   Oh my God.
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   Which sounds really funny and you'll realize he was dead serious, but you know, people, people, you know,
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   and so to have something like this scale of the London Underground, people must have been going nuts.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   And it's kind of amazing.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:48.000]   Anybody had the presence of mind to sort of step back and go, "I'm going to click record this for posterity. Click."
[00:15:48.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   Oh, what's sad is, I mean, heck, I have no idea, but I mean, there might have been some people that recorded something for posterity
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.000]   might eventually get seen where the person that did it maybe won't live to see it.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   I hope that's not the case, but I mean, it's definitely a possibility.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   Great use of a technology, you know, here for thought of as something frivolous, you know, being used in a manner that people really didn't expect it to be used in.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   It's kind of an instinct journalism.
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   Yeah, essentially. I mean, you know, ad hoc right there. I mean, the same thing with the tsunamis.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   You had people with cameras being able to digit and send it on the web and get, you know, first-hand accounts and, you know, really up the next hour for people to say before you would have to wait, literally, film at 11.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   Well, but also there's news about, you know, Flickr, the big photo website, FLICKR.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   They've apparently been, they've got hundreds and hundreds of photos on their website that people can see, which is kind of cool.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   It's a little different than going to your average news site and looking at their, you know, slideshows.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   It's unfiltered, which is, you know, an interesting, you know, way to get information that a lot of people may not be used to.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   Right.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   Like, I was...
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   Yeah.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   So...
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   NASA...
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   So, any of the shuttle launch...
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   Anyone other than me, because at least back when I was at tech TV, I seemed to be one of the only people that was interested in the space stories.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   I need the space shuttle launch on Wednesday 13th.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   I'm kind of interested in that.
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   I think that's great.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   I mean...
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   Through 51 p.m. Wednesday, the first shuttle launch since the 2003 Columbia disaster.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   This is the first one since the accident.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   Yep.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   There was a board that put together 15 recommendations for things to be resolved, issues, problems, safety measures.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   And so they met 12 of those 15.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   How about...
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   Over the last three that they didn't meet.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   Well, one of them was ability to fix repairs to a certain extent, meaning, like, say they launch up there, and they do have damage to the extent that the Columbia had.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   They won't be able to, to the best of my knowledge, I'm pretty certain I'm right.
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   Have the wherewithal to fix it.
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   They will have the wherewithal to fix smaller things, actually outside, but not something like that.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   Other things that they didn't completely satisfy include actual objects coming off of the external tank.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   I know that there's pieces of foam that were removed.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:30.000]   They put heaters up there to take away the amount of ice build up that can get on there because of how cold the coolant is.
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   But I know that they didn't satisfy, completely satisfy, for one of those directives.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   That said, I think they're going forward just because of the fact that, I mean, there are so many millions, so many thousands of things that can go wrong.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   They've covered and done a significant amount of work, and they feel at least to, to some extent, comfortable enough to go forward.
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   And to even agree that, you know, this will probably be about the safest flight we've ever done on the shuttle.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   Now, of course, it's a dangerous business, and that has to be understood.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   So, yeah.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   There was a stretch in there during the late '80s, early '90s, when it was almost routine to have someone to go into a lower Earth orbit and fix a satellite, drop a new satellite out, or take one back in.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   Well, you know, they want to retire the whole fleet by 2010, and they want to give themselves a four-year gap, I think, to have their next delivery vehicle, which they're going to call a crew crew, something.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   It's specifically for crew.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   They put the word "crew" in there for the next vehicle, and not going to be for cargo per se.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   But who knows how the development of something.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   That is pretty damn significant.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   I mean, the shuttle's, what, 1970s technology?
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   Yeah, they flew the Enterprise landing to have test flights back then, which Patrick and I had the awesome opportunity to see at the National Air and Space Museum next to the Dulles Airport that opened the Uyghurs back.
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:07.000]   We met Senator, former Senator John Glenn, which was pretty cool.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   Do you actually refer to Senators after they retired as Senators still or no?
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   I think so.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   I think.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   It just could have been a former president's president.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   I don't know.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   Yeah.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   I don't know if they're going to call me the "Conner Justice" or not.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   This is obviously a time for like, Emily Post and/or Google.
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   Hi, Senator.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   So continuing with the topic of space, which everyone hates.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   There's going to be another US millionaire going to the International Space Station aboard a Russian rocket.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   Really?
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   Which filthy rich man is it this time?
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   US millionaire Gregory Olson is due to become the third tourist to visit the International Space Station.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   Wow.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   I can feel this fortune on.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   I don't know, but it's probably a click away.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   59-year-old scientist who founded the US-based company Sensors Unlimited, which produces infrared cameras.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   According to Radio Free Europe Radio Liberty.org.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   Well, there's another wired story, which is kind of funny because it kind of deals with what we do.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   Essentially, it's a...
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   They actually have a story about how people are using the internet more and more.
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   Not just about sex, not just to download, but just talk about it.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   Basically have ongoing conversations with people.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   About what?
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   About sex.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   Okay.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:32.000]   This is a G-rated podcast, Roger.
[00:21:32.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   Yeah.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   Well, just funny is because they have a link in here.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   But the quote from this link says that the market for sex-based podcasts have been woefully underserved.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   What happens is just funny.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   You know, usually sex is the pioneer of a lot of new businesses, and I don't, to the best of my knowledge, that wasn't the case with podcasting.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.000]   Go figure.
[00:21:54.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   [Laughter]
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   See, now I said nothing dirty.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   Any updates for your computers lately?
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   I have the...
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   I have it set up to auto update on my XP Pro, which maybe I shouldn't.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   I don't know.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   I just let it do it.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   It took me forever to do service back to, but I think we talked about that a long time ago as well.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   Yeah, I just did the standard 2K updates that go with 2K.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   Are you still running Windows 2000, Roger?
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   Yes, I am.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   That's impressive.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   I actually like it.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:31.000]   I actually had no issues with 2000.
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:39.000]   It runs everything I needed to, and the only thing I can't run on it, which I'm kind of nipped about, is Premiere Pro 1.5.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   I use it at work on an external machine, but it just does not want to run.
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   It does not run in 2000.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   Funny.
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   What about video games?
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   I'm playing Medal of Honor, Pacific Assault, currently, and it works fine.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   Ever since I got that, a 9800 card from work.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   Nice.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   They give those away at your office, Roger?
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   No, only when I plead incessantly and say, "Well, you guys are getting all the new crop of cards.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   You won't need these, right?"
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   Big wine whimper.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   Actually, I just scored a 9800 for free myself.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   Oh!
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   Oh!
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   No, I didn't.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   Somebody was like, "What graphics card are you running?"
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   And I said, "You know, Geforce 5200."
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:22.000]   And they're like, "You, you, I'll give you one of my old graphics cards."
[00:23:22.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   And they gave me a new graphics.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   Oh, nice.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   You know, it's old to them, but it's exciting for me.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   Was this at work or was this just like someone on the, like someone you know?
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   Someone I know.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:33.000]   So.
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:37.000]   Speaking of that, have you, any of you ever just been in the public place recently and have,
[00:23:37.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   and just been recognized by someone you've never met?
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   Yesterday, in and out burger.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   'Cause that, 'cause that happened to me on Bart.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   I was like sitting, waiting for the train and some guy kept looking at me.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   I thought, I thought I was doing something wrong, but he kept staring at me for like five minutes.
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   And it scared the hell out of me because I thought like, you know what, this ear is going on on the top of my head or something.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   And this is, what's your name?
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   That's like, um, Roger.
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   Oh my God, oh my God.
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   And he runs up to me.
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:08.000]   It's just, I don't know.
[00:24:08.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   He says, "Oh my God, you're Roger from Colorado."
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   I says, "Yeah.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   How you doing?"
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   No, no one would, no one would recognize me, although I have been at trade shows and people recognize people I'm with.
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   And they say, "Oh, this is Prager."
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   Oh my God, it's Prager.
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   But they don't recognize the name, I think.
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   People always ask me.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:30.000]   I mean, if that, if you've ever been like in a position where you're just kind of really embarrassed or not,
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   maybe embarrassed is too strong a word, but kind of awkward.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   Um, I, I, okay, I have the most awkward meeting someone's story ever.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   Oh, that's here.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   Truck stop off five five.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   Going to the bathroom in a stand up stall.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   And guys like, does it double take?
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   Oh my God, you're Patrick Norton from the screensavers.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   And I'm like, "Yeah man, pleasure to meet you."
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   And he reaches his hand over to shake my hand and I'm like, "Dude, after we wash hands."
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   And he just looks at his hand and he's like, "Right, good idea."
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   That's funny.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   That's awesome.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   He would have to.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on one second.
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   So this is an old story, but definitely an ongoing story.
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   And it has to do with the fact that I'm sitting in my room right now using my neighbor's Wi-Fi to participate in this podcast.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   And there's a dude in Florida who just got arrested for using someone's unencrypted Wi-Fi.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   Right.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   Now granted, I'm not sitting in a truck across the street from their house doing it, but I still kind of am across the street.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   Also, though, I'm not doing anything that would be considered illegal online activity.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   However, I am using their connection and it's not directly authorized.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   Well, that's what, I don't think this guy was doing anything.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   I think he was just browsing the web on an open Wi-Fi.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   You know, people's computers are designed to, a lot of the software says connect me to the strongest signal.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   And that, quite honestly, is the only reason I even know that I could get free internet access from my bedroom is because my computer said,
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   "Hey, guess what? We're online."
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   I said, "Whoa, let's see what we can see."
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   And I'm like, "Wow, I can access the internet."
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.000]   I can download gigabytes and gigabytes of naughty stuff.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   And I don't know what kind of pipe he's got, but pretty quick.
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:18.000]   [laughter]
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   Yeah, you better move, Prager.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   This guy was just arrested, but he wasn't actually charged with any crime he had, has he?
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   Yeah, he's been charged with a third-degree felony for logging into a private Wi-Fi internet access point without permission.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   And how was he caught?
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   I mean, he was just sitting outside.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   He was sitting outside.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   So basically, he was sitting outside of house and somebody saw the glove as laptop through the back of his SUV.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   So they went out and the guy like snapped his computer shut and drove off and then came back like an hour later.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   That's weird behavior, but...
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   I mean, couldn't it be said though?
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   I think attorneys are going to have a field day with this one personally.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   Would you mean your taxes point wide open?
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   But that's just it.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   It is right now, though.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   But that's the default of most routers as well.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   Well, it's the, you know, the default of most locks is being unlocked.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:15.000]   But if I walk into your house, even though you installed a new lock and left the lock unlocked, I can still be arrested for trespassing.
[00:27:15.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   It's not about logic, it's about law, guys.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:18.000]   There's a difference.
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   Well, I mean, locking a door keeps honest people honest.
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   I don't know if the Wi-Fi quite works the same way by having it weapon-crypted.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   Does it keep an honest person honest?
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   Because I know some people, I know I have a friend who has an apartment and he has a router and he puts his SSID as apartment-
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   207.
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   Feel free, but that's who it is, by the way.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   You know, what's, you know, so, and as far as I'm concerned, even though I'm using my neighbors, if I had my own, I'd leave it wide open.
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   And if I had having problems with bandwidth, I'd probably then I'd start to worry about it.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   Maybe you would know this, Patrick.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   If someone did do something illegal, for example, did like, was stealing, like, credit card information using your internet access with that person who had, who was actually providing that broadband.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   That broadband access be liable for anything or not?
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   I am not a lawyer.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   But, you know, it's kind of scary.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   Hey, if this guy were actually sitting outside trying to systematically crack computers, he knew we're inside that were connected to that network.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   I'm sure there's a problem with that.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   But by Windows wireless configuration, like David mentioned, it's going to grab the strongest signal right there.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   And, you know, you could accidentally do something like that.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   And I'm often in places where there are multiple access points.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   And if I don't specifically, you know, pick the one I want or the one I know, I can get it.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   Hit a log on to whatever's there.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   Well, I mean, the other thing is, you know, the vast majority of ISPs say it's illegal for you to share this connection with other people.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   You know, it's for five computers inside of your house.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   That's what it said when I signed up.
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   Oh, ISPs, yeah.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   As far, I do think you're probably liable for what your internet connection is used for.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   You know, if my neighbor across the street gets hit by the RIAA because I've been downloading music that has been copywritten,
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   he might, my neighbor across the street might get in trouble and they might be right.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   But it could be my fault, but they don't, you know.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   Well, it sounds like one, it sounds like it's going to be a great time to bring a lawyer in to answer some questions.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   You know that if you go to this bill, if you go to your neighbor's office, if you go to your neighborhood,
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   Starbucks and sign up for the T-Mobile internet access that so many of them provide,
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   one of the things that you click on when you signing up says T-Mobile says we're not liable for what you do.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   Mm-hmm.
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   Which is a smart move by T-Mobile.
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   Interesting to see because how many times are they going to, how often do you figure they're going to be able to catch somebody in the middle of doing something like this?
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   No, it just happened, this guy came back.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   Right.
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   Which is, that's just some strange behavior anyway, when you're sitting out in front of some strangers house.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   Well, I mean you ever have a, you know, have a conversation with like a detective over a couple of beers and you hear that, you know, we catch a lot of the dumb ones and we get lucky with some of the really smart ones.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   No, I actually never talked to a detective, but...
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   You never talked to a detective, Roger?
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   Well, actually, no, I take that, does a private investigator count?
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   I mean, I think it's a good idea.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:40.000]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:30:40.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   It's a good idea.
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   It's a good idea.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   It's a good idea.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:15.000]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:32:15.000 --> 00:32:20.000]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:32:20.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:30.000]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:32:30.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:39.000]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:32:39.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:42.000]   I think it's a good idea.
[00:33:42.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   I think someone's just
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   swapping the frequencies.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   I've heard radio,
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   a lot of audio,
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   electronic engineers,
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   and I'm sort of down UFO causing all sorts of issues.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   I wish.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   I'm about to chang.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:19.000]   Propagating the truth again.
[00:34:19.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   Man with the word.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:29.000]   Believe me if you want.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   I'm not going to be able to flip.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   For everybody it's upgrading to a new power supply.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   You can't plug in your 24 pin power supply because your connectors
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   for your hard drives are too close to your power supply pins.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   You don't have to break off pieces of the IDE connectors.
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   You can unsnap the extra four pins.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   I'm not going to be able to flip them.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:07.000]   I'm not going to be able to flip them.
[00:35:07.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   I'm not going to be able to flip them.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   I'm not going to be able to flip them.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   I'm not going to be able to flip them.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   I'm not going to be able to flip them.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   Key Hacker Magazine faces closure.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   It's talking about...
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   FRAK FINAL #63 is scheduled for July 2005.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   Rumors of a frack resurrection in 2007 can neither be confirmed or denied.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:41.000]   FRAK FINAL at Glorious Area comes to the end.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   #63 will be our last frack release ever.
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.000]   Final call for papers.
[00:35:45.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   Final call for papers.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   Deadline the 10th of July 2000.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.000]   I'm reading this off of frack.org which is their homepage.
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   It's p-h-r-a-c-k.org.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   #63 will be our hardback edition available at Defcon.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   It says...
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   Wow.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   Speaking of which, who's going to Defcon?
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   Kevin's going to Defcon.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   I'm going to Defcon.
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   Defcon.org for those of you who are not familiar.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   I haven't planned ahead enough, but I see no reason because I'm three hours away.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   And it is...
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   I had the wacky idea of going to Cabo-san Lucas.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   Well, Defcon's happening, so...
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   Unfortunately, I won't be attending.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   Hey, Battle Star Galactica starts up again.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   Ooh!
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   Yeah!
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   I'm actually going to Comic-Con, but hopefully my sister will be kind enough and record it for me.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   Is Comic-Con next weekend in San Diego?
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   Yes.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   I will be flying down to get a couple of interviews with some of the video game, comic book, or comic book video games coming out.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   And not too distant future.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   Just get some developer interviews.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   Hopefully, I think they're doing a Battle Star Galactica panel, which would be kind of cool to sit in.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   They don't have any...
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   They didn't have any...
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   They didn't have any...
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   They had from last season.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   It was so good.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   It was such a good series.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   July 15th.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   They took their first episode out online.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   They did?
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   That was like...
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   Like a really crappy resolution.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:08.000]   But imagine that's for bandwidth reasons.
[00:37:08.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   You know, you can only do so much, but...
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   Well, I'll have to do it.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   But you can find TV rips online.
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   Also, you do.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   The pilot said...
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   A lot of advance in two years of...
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   And NBC is actually airing three Battle Star Galactica issues in High Death.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   They're testing the water, so to speak.
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   See how the ratings work out.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   I feel like sci-fi at all.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   That's one of the best shows out there.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   That's my personal favorite of all time.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   Is it me or is like when it first came out, it just seemed kind of like, oh yeah, it's just going to be a really bland redo of the original one.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   And then you watch your pilot say, "That's not bad."
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:49.000]   And then you watch the first season, "Okay, okay."
[00:37:49.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   And then you watch the last half and it's like, "Man, this show's freaking good."
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   It's really funny.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   Because it wasn't bad, but it was kind of shaky at points.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   You know, not everyone...
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   It was just a background.
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   They had to get the store going and get everyone up to speed.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   I think it was awesome.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   We missed the three episodes there last night.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   Yes, I actually watched two of them.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   If you get the sci-fi channel, they...
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   But I mean, anyone who hasn't seen it and has Netflix or something, ran out the Bousar Galactica pilot DVD.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   It's really good.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   Hey, so you're saying they're not on sci-fi for the new ones anymore?
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   No, they're on sci-fi.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:34.000]   They aired three episodes from season one on NBC in high definition.
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   Wow.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   Do you see getting smart?
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   When NBC owns the parent company of the sci-fi channel.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   Okay, then I know nothing about that relationship.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   Obviously.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   Good though.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   It's good to see that in high depth.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   Some of those space combat scenes and just the style that it shot in.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   It's just awesome.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   Good story, good characters.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   And don't watch the new season without seeing the first one because there's so much that's happening.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   Well, it's hard to...
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   I mean, I'm not sure it's...
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   They've released the mini series on DVD, but they haven't done the...
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   Right.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   They haven't done anything other than that on DVD yet.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   So it's not like you can go out and rent the DVDs unless they've released it secretly and I just haven't picked up on it.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   No, not yet.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   Technically savvy people know where to go find that stuff.
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   While we wait for DVDs to be pressed.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   With all the disappointing sci-fi movies that roll out like War of the Worlds.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   Actually, a lot of people like War of the Worlds.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   Wait, did you call them depressing or bad?
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   I think it's depressingly bad.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   Have you seen it, Roger?
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   Yes.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   I've seen the entire...
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   I was like, "Dude, I gotta watch it when it first comes out because I thought it was going to be like the hottest thing ever."
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   And I go and I know...
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:48.000]   Now, Mr. and Mrs. Smith was the hottest thing ever.
[00:39:48.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   Oh, gosh.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   I love the War of the Worlds, actually.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   The ending was...
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   I mean, the last half of it is...
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   Don't...
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:56.000]   No spoilers.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   It's all I'm asking.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   Well, have you read...
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   Have you read...
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   I know how the book ends.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:03.000]   I've seen the 50s movie.
[00:40:03.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   I've read the book and I've heard bits of the Orwell radio show.
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   I don't think it's a spoiler to say that ends the same.
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   That's it.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   Is that a spoiler?
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   No, it's not a spoiler.
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   That means you already know the story.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   No, it's just...
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   I'm a little myth because somebody forwarded me a review of Batman Begins.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   Uh-huh.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   And it contained a huge spoiler in the second paragraph.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   And I was just...
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   I didn't need to know about this.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   You had a much better idea.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   I had a chance to.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   I just met at a new house.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   I had a new house.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   I had a new house.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   I didn't say anything.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   And don't tell me what was in that review either, Patrick.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   The Weasel did it.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   I would say it is probably one of the best summer movies for 2005.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   Yeah.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   I'm excited.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   I'm looking forward to seeing it.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   I want to see Charlie and Chocolate Factory.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:54.000]   Everybody wants to...
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   I know.
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   Yeah, I'm a little uptight about that.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   That's 50/50.
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   Because Johnny Depp is the most...
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   You know, maybe he's like the choice actor of our generation.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   Is the most bizarre looking Willy Wonka I've ever seen?
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:09.000]   Well, yeah, Gene Wilder was such a particularly normal looking human being.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   Well, it's...
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   No, no, I mean bizarre.
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   Like, he doesn't sit that...
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   It's just me.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   Maybe it's going to be a darker try.
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   I mean, think about it.
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   A lot of nasty stuff happens in Charlie and Chocolate Factory.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   If the Gene Wilder edition never existed, do you think that people would be giving this movie any attention?
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   Given that it has the same budget and has the same, you know, obviously Johnny Depp's pretty big star.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   Well, but I mean Johnny Depp, what was Johnny Depp's last major film?
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   He won a Academy Award for...
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   No, he may be not.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   Was it?
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   Did he win something for the next year?
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   Let me rephrase it.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   Think in terms of...
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   No, no, no.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   Think in terms of Hollywood Prager.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   What was his last major film?
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   Pirates of the Caribbean.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   That's six of the millions.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   No, I'm kidding.
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   He made a lot of money off Pirates of the Caribbean.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   So everybody's like, "It's a kids movie, right?
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   Because it's Willy Wonka and it's weird stuff."
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   So yeah, there's going to be a lot of buzz around it.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   I don't know.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   Maybe he'll do...
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   No, I won't go to it.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   No, no, no, no.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   It's just that one scene of him, like in the trailer, reminds me so much of Natalie Merchant,
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   that it just creeps me out.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   And then I watch it.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   Wow.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   That's an insider to Roger's mind.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   That didn't mean...
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   Yeah, that's a little sketch, right?
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   Ah, hey, watch that movie trailer.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   Okay, we'll all go download it in quick time after this.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   And I'll be shaking my head.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   Who's...
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   He was like, "Just do it."
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   Anybody up for an email question?
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   Yes.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   All right, Alex is wondering...
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   He's thinking about clearing his hard drive, doing a fresh, clean install of Windows XP.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   Good man.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   And I should say Windows XP Pro, and he's wondering if for any reason if something goes wrong,
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   or if he doesn't like something, or if a really crazy error appears, will he still be able to use
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   the recovery CDs to restore his previous operating system, even though he just cleaned off his hard drive?
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   Recovery CDs.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   Aren't recovery CDs just a complete disk image as the system was shipped?
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   Yes.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.000]   Yes.
[00:43:05.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   Okay.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   And it's not just the applications that require the OS to already be there, that kind of thing.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   Correct.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   Well, it depends on that.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   I mean, usually the recovery disk is exactly how it came from the factory.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   Yeah.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:21.000]   All the shovelware, all the security software, the operating system, all that stuff.
[00:43:21.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   You know what?
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   If the system's built correctly with, you know, decent parts, I mean, relatively name-brand equipment.
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   I've never really had a problem with that.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   Just doing a fresh install of the disks, right?
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   Yeah.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:36.000]   Go for it.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   Just make sure he backs up all his data that he wants to keep.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   Totally.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   And enjoy the clean system.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   As soon as you get it completely cleaned up, have all, you know, of course, have all your drivers and your software ready to go patches and updates.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   Yeah, actually, that's one thing, is if he could partition a portion of it or just have all the other devices.
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   Burn them to CD, like all the drivers for the motherboard and the graphics card.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   You know, I know not everyone has it, but I'm a huge fan of having an external USB 2 or Firewall hard drive.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   I just copy over- I have essential files and essential things that I use.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:08.000]   That's a good idea.
[00:44:08.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   And that I need personal things.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   I mean, and even most of those external drives are well over 100 gigs that you can even put full-programs that you want and all that.
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   It's almost like-
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   A full disk image of windows, a clean image of windows, is usually under five.
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   It's usually under four gigs.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   And you can even crush it down a little bit further than that.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   If you wanted to just take a snapshot of the whole system when you're done installing the OS, you could fit it on an DVD easily.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   I used to do that with every system I'll build.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   Just in case something goes haywire in the first 30 days, it's still fresh.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   I can just put it back just the way it was and help them prevent that from happening again.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   We've got another good one here.
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   We were talking last week about, and maybe Prager and Roger, if you've got something you like in terms of backup software other than retrospect.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   But Dave Mullins wrote in- Dave wrote in- I'm not sure if we're using last names or not.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   Podcast 12, everyone was questioning backup software.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:11.000]   He says to try double image or double image O from hostinterface.com.
[00:45:11.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   That it does fuller incremental backups.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:17.000]   He uses it with his clients and external firewire drives and he loves it.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:20.000]   That's another option to consider.
[00:45:20.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   I use retrospectus because that's what my external driveship is.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   It's actually pretty handy.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   It's one of those things where you tell people about backup, but it's really hard to remember to do it on a regular basis.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   It's nice to have some automated to kick it in for you here.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   I always constantly say, "Oh my God, I forgot to update last week."
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   And my machine got hit by both of lightning and everything is gone.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   7.21 gigawatts.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   Stop the fan on your power supply.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   Me?
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   Hey, there was no motherboard damage or there was no data damage.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:59.000]   I just, you know, shorted out my power supply.
[00:45:59.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   I could have reused a power supply if I'd been willing to solder in a new capacitor.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   No, actually, no.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   It's really weird what Blue actually was a fuse on the motherboard.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   It blew so hard the entire inside of the fuse was covered with black smokey substance
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   and there was a giant piece of glass that had blown out of the side of the fuse,
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   which I've never seen in a glass fuse before.
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:24.000]   Is it a removable fuse?
[00:46:24.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   Oh no, I guess not.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   But we were talking about last week.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   Now that I've put a quiet power supply into my computer, I now know it's one of the old original $500 PCs that I built.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   I now know exactly how loud my fan is on my processor, which is too loud.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   And how loud my hard drive is.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:45.000]   So my next step is replacing the incredibly loud stock AMD fan on my processor.
[00:46:45.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   And I was going to do a Zalman fan because they have those amazingly quiet, cool fans for processors.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   And then I realized there was a cooler master on sale at a local store for like 11 bucks that only has 19 dB of noise.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   I'm going to try the, because it's the $500 PC.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   If you're going to go with the $11 fan rather than the $35 fan.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   You know, I've messed around with a couple of those cooler master, the really inexpensive cooler master heat sinks.
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   I've found that you really have to check the contact between the CPU and the bottom of that heat sink.
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   It seems that the bracket, whatever the retention bracket is that will hold the heat sink on top.
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   It seems it only really wants to fit one way, even though you can literally rotate it in any of the four directions usually.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   If it's a square or whatever the size of the heat sink itself is, usually can put it in any of the directions.
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   It seems to be one direction where you want to check the contact between the copper and the top of the CPU itself.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   Until I had rotated like another 90 degrees and tried it again and looked at the mark that the heat sink goop left on the heat sink itself.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   I realized I was getting like less than half of the CPU touching.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:50.000]   Oh wow.
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   And I was a little nervous about that.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   So you know, if you're going to buy super inexpensive stuff at least take the time to make sure it actually works.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   Once I had it rotated another 90 degrees and touched right up just great, but that was a little nerve-wracking at first.
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   I was like, "Whoa, that's hardly contacting."
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   I'm not going to do a whole lot of that.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   Is there anything kind of drawn or engraved on it that would tell you that?
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:14.000]   No.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   But this way?
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   I was at like a fries, electronics with a super store and they had like an open box.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   I just grabbed it and...
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   But it was 11 bucks, yay.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   But now I'm with you on that. From my gaming PC I use AS Almond.
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   I use one of their butterfly or whatever they call it, that flower shape.
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   They use fine strips of copper and/or aluminum.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:41.000]   And then they all come together at the bottom with the heat sink contacts the CPU.
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   Right.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:45.000]   And not only are they quiet, but they are very good.
[00:48:45.000 --> 00:48:47.000]   My system's an overclock system too.
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   About 600 megahertz or so.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   And it's been overclock for a couple of years now.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   It had no problems with the other thing is it acts like a bowl.
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:57.000]   The way the heat sink is shaped itself.
[00:48:57.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   It does kind of act like a bowl for dust.
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   So you have to clean it out.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   Clean it out.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   That's the thing I once in a while.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   Oh man, I rebuilt somebody's system recently.
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   And I could not believe.
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   There wasn't dust bunnies.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   It was dust buffaloes inside the system.
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   Holy.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   Everything was... it was amazing.
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:18.000]   I was blowing... literally, I probably blew like the equivalent of four or five cotton balls
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   out of his graphics card.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   Cool.
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   That stuff was inside of there.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   How old was the system?
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   Two less than two years.
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   Probably two... probably two years.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   Yes.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   Well, it's one of those things where it's like if you're going to operate a computer in an
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   area where there's a lot of lint from a dryer.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   Maybe it's time to do the whole, you know, penny hose/filter over the intakes on the back of
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   the monitor.
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   He didn't have overheating problems.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   He was lucky.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   No, well, you know, it's amazing.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   He ran it with a... he'd been running it also with the side of the case off a lot of the
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   time.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   So I think that's probably why I didn't overheat at all.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   Also, you know, that can help, but you should never... it's just such a dust magnet when you
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   have it, especially with the side of the case off.
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   There's almost no way to keep it from just everything going everywhere.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:11.000]   Well, I mean, everyone went on one of my main workbench machines that I do all my software testing on.
[00:50:11.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   I've never had a cave cover on the case, but it's in a room where I keep it pretty dust-free.
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:18.000]   So that's cool.
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   Yeah, like the office too, we would have the air filtration system.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   It keeps it pretty... keeps things mostly clean, but that's one thing I found.
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   It's best to not only get the case fully sealed up, but then Yoshi taught me this one lesson
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   was that make sure you have more air going into the case of coming out, just to maintain
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   a positive air pressure so that all the nooks and crannies were...
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   Normally, if you're sucking air out really hard of the case itself, it's pulling in from every little nook
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   and crannies and stuff gets clogged up in there and it just becomes a dust-free.
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   So just to make sure... make sure there's more air going out than coming in.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   The other way around.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   More air going in than coming out.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   Positive pressure inside the case.
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   To basically over pressurize your case.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:50:59.000]   Yep.
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   So that all the little vent holes and stuff, there'd be a slight breeze blowing out of them.
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:09.000]   That way, only the main fan that's pulling in air could actually be the one that's going to actually
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   bring a contaminant of some kind into the case itself.
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   And that you can either treat this.
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   But a filter on.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   Yeah, a filter even panty has like... I just mentioned...
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:19.000]   That works.
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   I'm packing down.
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:21.000]   Carefully.
[00:51:21.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   Works for robbing banks too.
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   Not so well.
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:24.000]   Not anymore.
[00:51:24.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   Don't ask us how we know.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   We're also talking about projectors last week.
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   John says, and he also admits that this business is owned by a buddy of his, but anybody's
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   interested in projecting, using a projector to project in a wall in their house to check
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:42.000]   out goosystems.com.
[00:51:42.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   They do...
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   Oh, well they've got a USA website now, but goosystems, they were based out of Canada.
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   And they make a great paintable, or a paint material that makes it a customizable screen.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   What color does it turn the wall when you paint the wall?
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   Or is it like a clear...
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   It depends what kind of gain you're looking for, how much you want to either enhance the brightness of the image
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   or you want to create a very darker image for enhancing black level.
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   And so you have actually a choice from like a whitish to a dark gray.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   I take it you like this product quite a bit.
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   Oh, we did.
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.000]   Yeah, but we did that actually in tech TV back in the day.
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   We had a...
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   We actually taped off a 16 by nine foot section of a wall.
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   What kind of paint was that?
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   Yeah, we used to... what they call the digital gray, I believe it was.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:26.000]   It was pretty neutral.
[00:52:26.000 --> 00:52:29.000]   But it was a... it wasn't... I don't believe it was gain...
[00:52:29.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   It wasn't enhancing the image in terms of brightening it, but I think we were looking more for a...
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   just good dark level for the projectors we're testing.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   Getting a good black is what we're shooting for.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.000]   With some of the cheaper projectors we're looking at.
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   Right.
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   Basically enhancing the... the chance for the black.
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:46.000]   I don't try to paint the black.
[00:52:46.000 --> 00:52:47.000]   You gotta be careful.
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:50.000]   And if you can spray it, that's definitely the best way to do it.
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   Rolling it really takes a fine touch not to get a like a line from the edge of the roller that dries in there.
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   You know, you're gonna see that every time you put up the projector, but you know, if you wanna do a custom surface,
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   that paint works.
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   It works really well.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   Cool.
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   It just takes some time and a good hand with it.
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:14.000]   Just notice that the Guz systems USA URL is dead, so I'm gonna put the original Guz systems.
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   Yeah, let's try Guz systems because they were based on a candidate last time I checked.
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   I believe they still are.
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:25.000]   I remember getting in these projector screens from Delight, which were really, really nice screens,
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   but boy do they cost a lot.
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:33.000]   I don't know about getting any more than 800 dollars screen for your $3,000 projector.
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:36.000]   Well, but also a lot of times they have ripples in the screens.
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:40.000]   Yeah, it's what I was talking about with the screen, guys.
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   I just like the name Goo Goo.
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:46.000]   Hey, the product works.
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:47.000]   It's a good thing.
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:50.000]   The ultimate flat screen is a projector baby.
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:56.000]   No thickness except for the material and the screen itself.
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   Here we got a question for you Robert.
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:05.000]   LCD televisions ran into a deal at DJ Noir Tech.
[00:54:05.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   Eric is DJ Noir Tech.
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   It's quite a nom de email.
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:13.000]   I hope you and the Twits are doing well.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   He ran into a deal at Costco this weekend, wanted to ask us about it before he bought it.
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   Philips Ambolite or Ambolite Ambolite?
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:22.000]   Ambolite.
[00:54:22.000 --> 00:54:26.000]   Philips Ambolite, 42 inch, 16 by 9, 80 TV ready.
[00:54:26.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   LCD TV, 1366 by 768 for $3,000.
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   It's his price range.
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   It's the size he wanted.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   It's 42 inches, 1366 by 768.
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   He's really itching to get a new TV to his game.
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   Since he gave his old one to his mother-in-law, his sons without a gaming TV,
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:48.000]   he wants to put the current TV and the kids he wants to basically hook himself up,
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   give the kid the old TV.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   What's our opinion of the Philips monitor, the Philips 42 inch Ambolite?
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:58.000]   Generally I find Philips's play is awesome and they're very good at jumping back and forth
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   between PC and home theater use.
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:03.000]   They seem to be able to support native resolution for...
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:09.000]   You just plug your PC in and you see the 1366 by 768 or whatever resolution it is.
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:11.000]   Manus are good to Ambolite technology.
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:16.000]   They're a biased light where they actually put a lighting system on the backside of the display
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   and then light up the wall that it's mounted on or wherever the display is.
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:22.000]   Oh, that's the backlight around the television.
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:23.000]   Right.
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:26.000]   It can dynamically change color to match the content on the screen.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   Oh, wow.
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:33.000]   What that does actually is when the edges are able to blend more from the edges of the display,
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:37.000]   from the physical display itself, the actual pixels, off to the edges of the wall.
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   You can actually match those colors up, you can get the eye to enhance it on contrast
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   or how you perceive contrast.
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:48.000]   You can get darker darks and brighter brides and a better perceived image quality.
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   Oh, wow.
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   It really does work.
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:51.000]   It's neat.
[00:55:51.000 --> 00:55:57.000]   Plus, you can also, if you're just a fashion maven, you can manually tile those lights into any color you want.
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:00.000]   You want to match the color.
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:07.000]   But the only my only concern about that particular display for 1366 x 768 at 40 some inches.
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:11.000]   That's a little low res for that, isn't it?
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   Yeah, that's what I'm thinking.
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:18.000]   Everyone's going to 1080 and one of the reasons they're going to hire resolutions for LCDs,
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   is supposedly it helps improve viewing angle.
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:27.000]   By just simply increasing the number of pixels, that was one of the ways that they've been able to really start tackling the viewing angle issue.
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:29.000]   It's 1366 running.
[00:56:29.000 --> 00:56:31.000]   That's definitely the one thing you want to do.
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   Is 1366 x 768?
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.000]   That's not 480p, is it?
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:36.000]   It's 720p.
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   It's 320p, sorry.
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:39.000]   So it'll scale it up a little bit.
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:41.000]   That's a good resolution.
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:42.000]   That's a plasma resolution.
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   That's common.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:44.000]   Okay.
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:48.000]   But if the picture looks good, I wouldn't buy without seeing it.
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:55.000]   In my experience, from everything I've dealt with, the Philips and the products, it's hard to pick up all this stuff.
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:00.000]   So as long as he can, if he can't see it in the store, then at least make sure he can return it without paying it to get a grease stock.
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:03.000]   Yeah, and if it's a cost-out, I think he said that's how much did he say this thing cost?
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   That's the safest place you can probably buy it display.
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:06.000]   Why is that?
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   Just the return policy is extremely generous.
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   You can basically return any TV at any time.
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:20.000]   As long as you, I think as long as you spent like a dollar more than you've taken back in products, they'll take it back.
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:24.000]   So I got a friend who bought a big screen, got it home, got it set up.
[00:57:24.000 --> 00:57:27.000]   A couple months later, it just wasn't doing it for him.
[00:57:27.000 --> 00:57:31.000]   Put it back in the car, took it back, swapped it out for another one.
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:37.000]   Unfortunately, it is an abusable system, but I'm glad a lot of people don't.
[00:57:37.000 --> 00:57:40.000]   It just seems to be for a return policy that generates.
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:44.000]   It's a nice just a mentioned Costco for that alone.
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:49.000]   I think fewer people abuse it because it's a pain in the butt to drag 50 inch television back.
[00:57:49.000 --> 00:57:50.000]   Very true.
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:52.000]   I can't tell you.
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:58:01.000]   If you've ever been in a Costco parking lot, it is nothing but a seat of empty boxes like washing machines to televisions.
[00:58:01.000 --> 00:58:08.000]   There's nobody can actually get the box with the display inside of it into their car, but they can take it out of the box and just throw the display in the back seat or something.
[00:58:08.000 --> 00:58:09.000]   Oh, funny.
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.000]   Crazy.
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:18.000]   The other thing too is that Costco typically has discontinued or models that are being phased out at a discount.
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   They're good at dumping stuff like that.
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:22.000]   That's not a bad thing.
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:29.000]   It's going to be probably the lowest, probably very competitive pricing you'd find online or in that and it's a local store.
[00:58:29.000 --> 00:58:32.000]   If there is something wrong with it, you just bring it right back.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:35.000]   That's where I got my Laid-On 2005.
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:38.000]   It's a set top DVD recorder.
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.000]   It's like $120.
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:46.000]   I want to try out one of Laid-On's over the air tuners if they make one.
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:50.000]   I'm starting to see a lot of people use ATI's, what is it, the zillion chip?
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:51.000]   Mm-hmm.
[00:58:51.000 --> 00:58:53.000]   Man, I'm going to kick myself if I'm wrong on this one.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:55.000]   I think it's the zillion part.
[00:58:55.000 --> 00:58:56.000]   ATI's a bunch of chips.
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:02.000]   It's a surprisingly number, a surprising number of televisions and set top boxes that they're chips and now being used in.
[00:59:02.000 --> 00:59:07.000]   I think it's the same chip they're using in their HDTV Wonder for tuning over the air.
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:12.000]   I'm just, I'm a big fan of the air stuff, so I'm always looking for a good set top box.
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:20.000]   Right now I'm using that boom still as my over the air tuner box to engage against other tuners.
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:23.000]   I'd like to upgrade that at some point.
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:25.000]   I'm glad it still works.
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:27.000]   What do you normally watch?
[00:59:27.000 --> 00:59:30.000]   Unfortunately, there's not a lot on during the day.
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:36.000]   I mean, my favorites, PBS, but they don't start their HD broadcast until 8PM Pacific.
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:46.000]   If you have a way to record that, that's great, but I don't think a lot of people have HD recorders at home right now.
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:49.000]   But the other thing is HDNet is always broadcasting stuff.
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:54.000]   Just recently, I mean, in the last couple of weeks, it seems they've added some new content finally.
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:58.000]   I watch this loop basically every day on the new sets I get in.
[00:59:58.000 --> 01:00:01.000]   It's from say like 9 to about 3 in the afternoon.
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:04.000]   They show this like 6 hour loop with all the same stuff over and over again.
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:14.000]   So I've seen all the same content like a dozen times, but finally they had some new stuff on Friday and I was enjoying immensely.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:17.000]   And then there's the Windows Media HD stuff.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:19.000]   Fine fascinating.
[01:00:19.000 --> 01:00:20.000]   Hello, PELP.
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000]   Twin with Media HD.
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000]   Hey, that's some good quality.
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000]   And it bit rates that will fit on a DVD.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:33.000]   I'll be curious to see if people start getting into that a little bit where, you know, while we're waiting for Blu-ray and HDVD
[01:00:33.000 --> 01:00:37.000]   and the media is going to be really expensive initially, I'll bet you you're going to see a lot of companies
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:43.000]   start pushing their compression technology some ways of using a DVD player or a set top player
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:49.000]   to record HD to a regular burnable DVD and then watch that on your set top device.
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:55.000]   I think there's going to be a nice transition there between those two going from the new high capacity
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:04.000]   formats for, you know, optical media that you can record HD on and the having it what you have right now that's so inexpensive
[01:01:04.000 --> 01:01:08.000]   disc prices are well under a bucket disc for good media.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:13.000]   And just being able to use that a little bit longer and I'm a little bit eager to see a lot of new new player support,
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:17.000]   some of the new high def compression schemes that will allow you to record that content.
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:27.000]   Hey Robert, you wouldn't know the compatibility for burnable dual layer discs and standard set top DVD players.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:30.000]   It should work just fine.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:36.000]   I find honestly some players are quirky about the brands of media.
[01:01:36.000 --> 01:01:42.000]   In particular, I was messing around with the PlayStation 2 the other day and that granted that's not the best DVD player in the world.
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.000]   I'm not far from it but it didn't even like Sony's own media.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:53.000]   I was trying Sony's media. I tried it and I finally tried about two other brands and then I found a brand new slab of verbatim plus R.
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:57.000]   And that's the only disc I found that I've been able to burn and play in a playstation.
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:02:01.000]   Dash R of any brand wouldn't work.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.000]   And then...
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:06.000]   Was that just standard single layer media?
[01:02:06.000 --> 01:02:07.000]   Yeah, that was.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:10.000]   See my problem with dual layer right now is disc prices.
[01:02:10.000 --> 01:02:13.000]   Have you found it for five bucks a disc yet?
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:14.000]   No.
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:18.000]   It's still upwards. If you buy a single disc it can cost you 10, 12, 13 bucks.
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:23.000]   So that's the irritating thing. The drive prices have come down but media prices are still kind of high.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:24.000]   Yeah.
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:29.000]   And you notice they don't pack any of those dual layer discs in the box when you buy one of those new drives usually.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.000]   Actually, hold on.
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.000]   You've got me googling.
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:36.000]   I love my view.
[01:02:36.000 --> 01:02:37.000]   I love my view.
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:38.000]   I'm typing up the show notes.
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.000]   Dual layer DVD. It's $4 online.
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:43.000]   But normally, yeah, $6.
[01:02:43.000 --> 01:02:47.000]   Well, let me see this. Let me check this link. It's looking a little sketchy.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.000]   I like buying the printable media, the kind you can put in an inkjet printer.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:57.000]   It's like a good surface on the back. I don't even really print them, but it's more for that protective layer on that label side.
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:05.000]   I have a spindle I think, about 94 discs left for that purpose.
[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:10.000]   I don't even have a printer. I mean, I could get the attachment for my printer, but...
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:15.000]   No, I'm not saying. I don't even print the using it for printing. I just like that protective layer.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:17.000]   Oh, I see what you're saying.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:20.000]   Just an added layer for itself more robust.
[01:03:20.000 --> 01:03:22.000]   For the reflective side.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:32.000]   Right. And now it looks like TDK's lines are sending that armor disc technology to everyone now because I'm seeing everyone coming up with discs that you can literally...
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:37.000]   And their armor, what do they call it? It's like an armor coat. It's a special coating they put on the disc.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:44.000]   And essentially, I've taken a sharpie to the data side, written all over it, and then took a piece of steel wool and rubbed it out.
[01:03:44.000 --> 01:03:46.000]   And the disc was fine.
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:47.000]   Wow.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000]   So that's...
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.000]   Is it like some weird lacquer or something that they stick on?
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:56.000]   It is a coating that they came up with. And I believe that's what they're using for Blu-ray.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:04:02.000]   I believe Blu-ray immediately adopted that because that was the way they were able to finally have a caddyless disc.
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000]   The disc wouldn't require it being in a lot of DVD RAM.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:08.000]   One of those big cartridges to protect it.
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:09.000]   Right.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:10.000]   It was just...
[01:04:10.000 --> 01:04:14.000]   The media layers within the structure of the disc are so thin.
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:22.000]   And that finally, because this new coating technology is out there and relatively cheap, it costs like a couple of cents a disc to have it applied.
[01:04:22.000 --> 01:04:28.000]   They're able now to give you... Hopefully, we'll see this in store soon, but you're building it.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:29.000]   According to the...
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:30.000]   TVK web...
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:31.000]   Do you believe it's dropped in?
[01:04:31.000 --> 01:04:44.000]   According to the... No, I was just saying... According to the TDK website, they say that standard blank media compared to the TDK armored-plated discs, their armored-plated discs provide a 100 times greater resistance to damage from everyday use such as scratches to fingerprints.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:47.000]   That's not... I would say that's not an exaggeration.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:54.000]   I can't think of any disc I've been able to take a Sharpie to and get it off, let alone with a piece of steel wool.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.000]   Right.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000]   And still be able to use the media.
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:04:58.000]   It's fine.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:01.000]   So you're saying the TDK is the bomb-proof disc of choice?
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:09.000]   Yeah, but the funny thing is, I see more companies offering all brands of media now offering that armor layer, especially for their premium products.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.000]   And I'm pretty sure they've all licensed TDK technology.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:19.000]   'Cause I was... They introduced that at CES a couple years back. And then it kind of got quiet for a while. I always wondered, you know, whatever became of it.
[01:05:19.000 --> 01:05:21.000]   Yeah, it came out in 2003, I guess.
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:25.000]   The Blu-ray guys jumped on that and said, "Oh, that's how we can get rid of the caddy."
[01:05:25.000 --> 01:05:26.000]   Yay!
[01:05:26.000 --> 01:05:28.000]   Now the Americans will buy it.
[01:05:28.000 --> 01:05:29.000]   Yay!
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:31.000]   [Laughter]
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:36.000]   I wonder if that increases the overall life expectancy of the media, just sitting in storage.
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000]   I sure hope so.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:42.000]   Yeah.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:45.000]   As long as it doesn't come across that laser rock that laser discs or so.
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:48.000]   That kid proofed a little bit more.
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:51.000]   Kidproofing is crucial.
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:53.000]   The ultimate evil is sharpened.
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:05:54.000]   It's amazing.
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:57.000]   So it's the scratch-proof DVD, is that what they're calling it now?
[01:05:57.000 --> 01:05:58.000]   Yeah.
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:05:59.000]   Well, they had like a really cool...
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:00.000]   Check it out TDK, sorry.
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:02.000]   At least it's called the Armor-Plated DVD.
[01:06:02.000 --> 01:06:03.000]   Yeah.
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.000]   Now it's like it's...
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000]   I'm not even sure if they sell that under their own brand name in any way.
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:08.000]   Here it is.
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:09.000]   TDK scratch-proof.
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:15.480]   I'm a big fan of verbatim blank media too, just because they're usually some of the
[01:06:15.480 --> 01:06:16.480]   first...
[01:06:16.480 --> 01:06:20.000]   If there's ever a new format, they'll have the media before anyone else.
[01:06:20.000 --> 01:06:21.000]   Seems.
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:24.000]   And the quality.
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:28.000]   Sorry, typing that into the show notes too.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:30.000]   Ooh, double-sided DVD.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:31.000]   Nice.
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:32.000]   Oh, that's an 8-centimeter.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.000]   That's a small one.
[01:06:33.000 --> 01:06:35.000]   Oh, just got some bad news.
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:36.000]   What's that?
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000]   I'm just getting this out of the World Series of Poker.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000]   Oh, I didn't even know he was in it.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000]   Shoot.
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:42.000]   I must be behind this time.
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:43.000]   Did you go to us with the blog?
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:45.000]   I got that email from somebody.
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:46.000]   Dot net.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:50.000]   Yeah, last time I talked to him during that one.
[01:06:50.000 --> 01:06:54.000]   Who sponsored a man, or did you just pay the 10 grand for one of the...
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.000]   I don't know.
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000]   Weren't they all playing for charities though?
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:58.000]   I don't know.
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:06:59.000]   Sorry.
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:01.000]   Well, if he's in the World Series of Poker, yeah, I guess...
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:05.000]   Well, there's a whole bunch of games in the World Series of Poker.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:08.000]   I'm pretty indifferent, probably, so you can win.
[01:07:08.000 --> 01:07:09.000]   So...
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.000]   And actually, the Justi Geek is doing an audiobook of that one.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:17.000]   You know, we were talking about rebuilding that system earlier, the person who wrote in.
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:23.000]   Have you guys ever tried slipstreaming Windows service packs into, like, take your Windows disk,
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:28.000]   and then slipstream, like, service pack to into it, and recreate a new disk that had contains all those updates?
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.000]   No.
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:34.000]   I've been reading up on that, and it sounds like a thing I want to do, or start doing at least.
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:39.000]   I believe it's all Microsoft software too, the last time I was just digging in that before I split it for the weekend.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:41.000]   Well, you should report about that next week.
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:44.000]   You know, that's something I'm definitely going to try because...
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000]   Prager?
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.000]   Wow, no, I...
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:48.000]   Oh, that's...
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.000]   Oh, god, me.
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:55.000]   I just went to World Series of Poker.com and they've got 5,619 players signed up for a $10,000 buy-in.
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.000]   Mm-hmm.
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:08:01.000]   And what that means is that the top 560 people who place will actually win money,
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.000]   the number one would get 7.5 million.
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.000]   Yeah.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:07.000]   Number two, 4.25 million.
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:09.000]   They've got over $52 million in prize money.
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.000]   Yeah.
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:15.000]   Well, the poker's also more pop-made poker, like, this kind of poker is more popular than it's ever been.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000]   Yeah.
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:22.000]   Now that you no longer have to be a leather-assed road gambler, to be good enough to win the tournament.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:26.000]   That's actually a very bad image of my head.
[01:08:26.000 --> 01:08:29.000]   Sorry, I should probably edit that out too.
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.000]   Nah.
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:34.000]   You play an audio effects.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:36.000]   At this point, we just don't know.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:37.000]   Gentlemen, I think...
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:39.000]   You've run out of space.
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:41.000]   I think it's time to let go.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000]   It's 20 p.m. people.
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000]   Have a look at the editing.
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.000]   Editing.
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:47.000]   What's that?
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:49.000]   This one should be a pretty easy edit.
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:53.000]   Half of what I was doing last week was relearning how to audio edit because I'd forgotten most of it.
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:54.000]   Nice.
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:08:58.000]   We also want to politely ask everyone to use iTunes and get the podcast.
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:03.000]   You'll have the best download quality and use the main mp3 feed.
[01:09:03.000 --> 01:09:08.000]   If we get lucky, we'll also pump our rating up on the iTunes podcast listings.
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.000]   And do us a favor.
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:13.000]   If you download this and listen to it after the fact, it might be too late.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:18.000]   Well, just go ahead and P on Hyper-Aide Davis.
[01:09:18.000 --> 01:09:20.000]   I love not to give it a shot.
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000]   But, yeah, iTunes 4.9.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:27.000]   The other thing is do us a favor and vote for us on podcast alley, so we can be all hoopty in the ratings.
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:32.000]   I'm going to download it and install it and give it a shot.
[01:09:32.000 --> 01:09:37.000]   If nothing else, leave it on your system and let it download the Twitchcast.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:38.000]   Cool.
[01:09:38.000 --> 01:09:40.000]   I'm curious how cleanly does it uninstall?
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000]   That's always my big question.
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:45.000]   It comes with QuickTime 7 whether you want it or not.
[01:09:45.000 --> 01:09:47.000]   No, you do not have to download it.
[01:09:47.000 --> 01:09:48.000]   You don't have to download it.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:50.000]   Is it what's the PC?
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:54.000]   You have to download QuickTime, but I don't think they'd want to bundle that.
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:55.000]   No, I have to.
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:56.000]   It's not the...
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.000]   It's not opening my system.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.000]   The Bailey, really?
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.000]   Because I had no problems with the beta.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:03.000]   It just seemed like every time I opened a video, I was getting a...
[01:10:03.000 --> 01:10:04.000]   You know what?
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:07.000]   It could be part of my notebooks, driver stuff.
[01:10:07.000 --> 01:10:09.000]   I didn't try it on a desktop system.
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:14.000]   I probably should have, but I was running into a problem where it seemed like it'd go into some editing mode.
[01:10:14.000 --> 01:10:19.000]   Every time I opened up an AV file, every time I closed it, it would ask me, "Oh, do you want to save your change?"
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.000]   And I'm like, "I didn't do anything."
[01:10:20.000 --> 01:10:22.000]   Yeah, see, I haven't had any of that at all.
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:23.000]   Okay.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:24.000]   That's probably the notebook.
[01:10:24.000 --> 01:10:26.000]   Maybe you should uninstall it and reinstall it.
[01:10:26.000 --> 01:10:27.000]   I'm telling you.
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:30.000]   I'm gonna back up my data first.
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.000]   Oh boy, scary stuff.
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:34.000]   All of it.
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:35.000]   Back it up, man.
[01:10:35.000 --> 01:10:36.000]   No, this one is like my work notebook.
[01:10:36.000 --> 01:10:37.000]   This is...
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:38.000]   Right.
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:39.000]   We shouldn't be installing.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000]   I'm gonna tell Bill at work.
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:43.000]   Uh, Bill's my buddy.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:48.000]   I don't do anything he wouldn't approve of.
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:49.000]   Bill?
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:52.000]   I keep myself on the up and up with him.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:56.000]   It's been downloading Banas and installing them on a production notebook.
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:11:00.000]   Oh, 'cause I was trying to watch a video a friend of mine put out and he had just dumped
[01:11:00.000 --> 01:11:01.000]   it out of compressor.
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:02.000]   Right.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:03.000]   In a premiere... or is it premiere?
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:06.000]   No, what did they use in the app and Apple?
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:07.000]   Final Cut.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:08.000]   Final Cut.
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:10.000]   So you just finished whatever.
[01:11:10.000 --> 01:11:12.000]   Is that for audio or video editing?
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:13.000]   Video.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:14.000]   It shows you how little I've been.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:17.000]   I was gonna say, man, that's your story.
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000]   No, I mean, I can tell you anything you want to know about PC stuff.
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:20.000]   Oh, I am.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:22.000]   Just tell me a lot more than I can tell.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:23.000]   I'm ignorant.
[01:11:23.000 --> 01:11:25.000]   I'm ignorant when it comes to Apple a bit.
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:28.000]   I don't even know what an iPod is.
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:29.000]   You want one of mine?
[01:11:29.000 --> 01:11:30.000]   I've got like seven now.
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:31.000]   Actually, that's not true.
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.000]   You know what you know, I'll say this.
[01:11:32.000 --> 01:11:33.000]   One of the coolest.
