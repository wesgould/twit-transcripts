[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:03.520]   I look forward to this all week long.
[00:02:03.520 --> 00:02:07.200]   Because it's like, I want to know what I want.
[00:02:07.200 --> 00:02:08.480]   Did you read, what do you think?
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:09.600]   How about this?
[00:02:09.600 --> 00:02:12.520]   Is this where I get together with the smartest people I know
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:14.080]   and we analyze the news.
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:16.520]   And frankly, I'm the consumer here.
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.680]   I want to know what people like Ian Thompson of the Register
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.920]   think about things.
[00:02:20.920 --> 00:02:21.440]   Welcome.
[00:02:21.440 --> 00:02:22.200]   Good to have you.
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:22.920]   Oh, it was a pleasure.
[00:02:22.920 --> 00:02:23.640]   And he was a pleasure.
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:25.960]   And a nice received accent.
[00:02:25.960 --> 00:02:26.520]   I like it.
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:27.800]   Received pronunciation, right?
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:28.480]   RP.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:29.160]   Yeah, RP.
[00:02:29.160 --> 00:02:30.200]   You taught me that.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:31.160]   Yes, indeed.
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:32.960]   It's a curse, but also a blessing.
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:34.200]   It is a blessing.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:35.120]   It is a blessing.
[00:02:35.120 --> 00:02:36.480]   And so do you get mid-westerners coming up?
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:37.680]   Do you go, oh, I love your accent.
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:38.160]   It's so cute.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:38.680]   Say something.
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:39.480]   Say something.
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:40.240]   Go away.
[00:02:40.240 --> 00:02:41.800]   Oh, it's so cute.
[00:02:41.800 --> 00:02:42.920]   And he says it.
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.520]   I love it when they get angry.
[00:02:44.520 --> 00:02:45.520]   Oh, wow.
[00:02:45.520 --> 00:02:46.520]   Oh.
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:48.280]   This is going to be a very interesting episode.
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.400]   I can kind of already tell.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:50.440]   Alex Wilhelm's here.
[00:02:50.440 --> 00:02:53.560]   That guarantees it'll be an interesting episode.
[00:02:53.560 --> 00:02:55.200]   From where do you from?
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.360]   Mattermark.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:56.960]   Mattermark.
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:02:57.480]   Mattermark.
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:02:59.360]   So I installed some software called Mattermost.
[00:02:59.360 --> 00:03:02.120]   And I was like, how is it that Alex works for this company
[00:03:02.120 --> 00:03:06.000]   that does this kind of like messaging platform?
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:07.280]   That's because I don't.
[00:03:07.280 --> 00:03:08.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:08.760 --> 00:03:09.760]   You had to realize.
[00:03:09.760 --> 00:03:11.360]   I was so close.
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.000]   I'm impressed that you got the name almost right.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.120]   Matter something.
[00:03:14.120 --> 00:03:15.320]   Yeah, well, you know, it matters.
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:15.840]   Mattermark.
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.280]   Mattermark.
[00:03:16.280 --> 00:03:19.120]   I literally for like a day wondered,
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:21.320]   I wonder why they hired Alex Wilhelm.
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.840]   Because what they do is a Slack competitor,
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:25.400]   an open source Slack competitor.
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:26.360]   It's actually very good.
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:26.880]   It's really cool.
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:27.760]   Isn't that an Slack?
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:28.800]   Yeah, self-hosted.
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:29.240]   Oh, really?
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:30.440]   So you don't pay anything for it.
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:31.880]   Well, Slack's pretty cheap for--
[00:03:31.880 --> 00:03:32.360]   Yeah.
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:34.480]   It adds up if you-- you know, it's like five bucks a person
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.320]   per month.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:35.840]   Yeah.
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:36.760]   But Slack is so good.
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.400]   I feel like that's a possible one to eat.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:39.600]   Even if I pay for it myself.
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:39.920]   I know.
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:41.040]   I just love Slack.
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:42.120]   Is Slack a sponsor today?
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:44.520]   I love Slack.
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:44.880]   Also--
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.040]   No, we hate it.
[00:03:46.040 --> 00:03:47.640]   Ah.
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.200]   From techinsider.io.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:51.720]   Is that right?
[00:03:51.720 --> 00:03:52.080]   Yeah.
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:52.600]   I got it right.
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:53.080]   You got it right.
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:53.560]   Finally.
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:54.000]   Not.com.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:55.280]   Steve Kovac is here.
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:58.240]   That's a division of business.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:04:00.280]   Yeah, it's our first spin-off site.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:01.200]   Nice.
[00:04:01.200 --> 00:04:02.680]   Now, I noticed you have-- I didn't notice this before.
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:04.200]   You have the Skyline of New York on your arm.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.320]   It's actually not New York.
[00:04:05.320 --> 00:04:07.320]   It's a-- I'm also appealing because I was--
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.800]   Is it your monopoly board?
[00:04:08.800 --> 00:04:09.160]   What is it?
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:12.000]   No, it's kind of an imaginary comic bookie.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:12.440]   It's coffee.
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:12.880]   It's a comedy--
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:13.720]   Come on, I admit it.
[00:04:13.720 --> 00:04:14.400]   It's Gotham.
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.160]   Nice thing.
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:15.840]   Yeah.
[00:04:15.840 --> 00:04:17.120]   He's actually Peter Parker.
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:20.480]   And he works for it.
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:21.720]   So I don't know where to begin.
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:23.480]   There's so much juicy and delicious stuff.
[00:04:23.480 --> 00:04:25.280]   I guess I have to start with you, Ian Thompson,
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:25.880]   and your article.
[00:04:25.880 --> 00:04:26.040]   You're article--
[00:04:26.040 --> 00:04:27.040]   You're article--
[00:04:27.040 --> 00:04:30.480]   You wrote the article that busted open the Microsoft
[00:04:30.480 --> 00:04:35.040]   Caper Game Developer Conference was this week, GDC.
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.000]   It's a great event.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.840]   And of course, Microsoft held, I think, a great panel
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:41.960]   on how to increase diversity in game developing,
[00:04:41.960 --> 00:04:43.800]   how to get more women involved.
[00:04:43.800 --> 00:04:45.480]   Yeah, it's become a regular thing.
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:49.240]   It's this women in gaming lunch, and then just a few hours later.
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:54.680]   They have a party for Xbox with dancers--
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:04:56.720]   Well, wearing the kind of schoolgirl uniforms
[00:04:56.720 --> 00:04:58.080]   I wish they were at most school--
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:00.280]   Schoolgirls never wore those uniforms, ever.
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:00.780]   Exactly.
[00:05:00.780 --> 00:05:03.440]   Plaid skirts and braziers, basically.
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:03.920]   Yeah.
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:09.160]   And I think your article really galvanized a lot of critics.
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.000]   I wouldn't have done the story, but you're here.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:11.640]   No, no.
[00:05:11.640 --> 00:05:13.080]   I mean, it's fine.
[00:05:13.080 --> 00:05:14.720]   I mean, I can't honestly claim credit for--
[00:05:14.720 --> 00:05:15.560]   I mean, it was--
[00:05:15.560 --> 00:05:16.400]   Were you at the event?
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:18.760]   No, it was female developers at the event that saw--
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:19.200]   Tweeting.
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:19.680]   Tweet out about this.
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:21.360]   People like Rana Wu and others saying--
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.480]   Yeah, what is that going on?
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:24.000]   I'm saying, this is--
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.840]   Hang on, guys, the 1970s call, and they'd like their attitudes
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:27.320]   back, please.
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:30.200]   We haven't-- I mean, this is Boothbabs, basically.
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:30.840]   Pretty much.
[00:05:30.840 --> 00:05:31.200]   I mean--
[00:05:31.200 --> 00:05:32.720]   You don't see these at conferences much anymore, right?
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.000]   It's kind of like at the women in gaming lunch
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.400]   if they'd had sort of chip and dales waiters, lightly oiled,
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:41.200]   serving suggestively slaves to shape snacks,
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.360]   to female attendees.
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:45.000]   I mean, it's that kind of level of mental disconnect.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:45.520]   Yeah.
[00:05:45.520 --> 00:05:48.360]   And I don't know what on earth went on with the expo--
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.160]   Well, Microsoft has apologized now.
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:53.200]   They're very swift and groveling apology, yes.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:55.040]   But there was no other possible response.
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.600]   If they equivocated even one aeodon this,
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:05:59.600]   they would have gone through two bad media cycles.
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.120]   Yeah.
[00:06:00.120 --> 00:06:00.960]   They only had one option.
[00:06:00.960 --> 00:06:04.360]   You know, though, it does remind me of the kind of historically
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.720]   boneheaded PR Xbox has had since they announced the Xbox one.
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:10.960]   This is the same company that said, well, it'll be all right
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:12.760]   unless you're in a submarine.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:14.320]   They always are on thing.
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.280]   I mean, so many of their PR people
[00:06:16.280 --> 00:06:18.880]   have blundered with around Xbox.
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:19.360]   Yeah.
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.160]   And it's a shame because I think the Xbox--
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.520]   I'm an Xbox user.
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:23.840]   You're probably all PlayStation, guys.
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:24.360]   I'm PlayStation.
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:24.880]   Yeah.
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:26.760]   You look like a PlayStation.
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:27.280]   What about me?
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:27.800]   What about me?
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:29.160]   It's the PlayStation to you.
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:30.760]   Well, you're lucky because, you know,
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.600]   the other big story at GDC was PlayStation announced
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.560]   their VRs.
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.760]   I am going to buy it.
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:37.160]   See, now this is what--
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.280]   Well, see, that's what's interesting to me
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:40.000]   because I also think that a lot of people
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.120]   bought the PlayStation 4 because it was $100 cheaper
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:43.640]   than the Xbox one.
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:46.200]   And now you're saying I'm going to buy a $400 visor, though.
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:47.800]   This is my easiest access to VR.
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.160]   I don't--
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:48.640]   It is.
[00:06:48.640 --> 00:06:49.840]   This is the only computer I own.
[00:06:49.840 --> 00:06:52.000]   I don't have a $1,000 gaming PC.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.360]   I have a $350 PS4 that I use all the time.
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:59.040]   As long as it was under $600 all in,
[00:06:59.040 --> 00:07:01.640]   I was going to buy whatever they announced this weekend.
[00:07:01.640 --> 00:07:03.960]   And you're not going total Apple fanboy, then.
[00:07:03.960 --> 00:07:05.120]   You do have an upper price limit.
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.120]   Oh, yeah.
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:06.680]   Yeah.
[00:07:06.680 --> 00:07:07.760]   This is not the iPad Pro.
[00:07:07.760 --> 00:07:08.120]   Come on.
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:08.600]   Yeah.
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:09.040]   Exactly.
[00:07:09.040 --> 00:07:09.560]   All right.
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:10.400]   I can't--
[00:07:10.400 --> 00:07:12.320]   Nvidia said-- I can't remember the number
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:15.800]   that there were only something like 18 million PCs
[00:07:15.800 --> 00:07:17.400]   in the world that could run an Oculus Rift.
[00:07:17.400 --> 00:07:18.040]   Exactly.
[00:07:18.040 --> 00:07:21.160]   Tiny number out of the several 100 million.
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:23.360]   There are 38 million PlayStation 4s.
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:23.880]   Yeah.
[00:07:23.880 --> 00:07:27.880]   They're going to be the early leader in the high-end VR game.
[00:07:27.880 --> 00:07:30.520]   What annoyed me about this announcement was they come out
[00:07:30.520 --> 00:07:32.520]   saying it's going to be $399.
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.080]   Everyone flipped out immediately.
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:35.960]   And then you dig in and realize it doesn't come
[00:07:35.960 --> 00:07:39.040]   with the PlayStation camera, which is necessary for the thing
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:40.520]   to actually work.
[00:07:40.520 --> 00:07:44.760]   So for $399, you get a non-functional VR headset,
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:45.640]   unless you already bought that.
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:46.800]   How much is the camera?
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.880]   About 50 or 60 bucks on top of that.
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:49.880]   It's not that much more.
[00:07:49.880 --> 00:07:50.200]   No.
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:52.880]   And you need to move controllers, too, right?
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:07:56.360]   So then two days later, they announced a bundle that's $499
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:07:58.040]   that has everything you need.
[00:07:58.040 --> 00:07:59.040]   So that's the real price.
[00:07:59.040 --> 00:08:00.720]   So that's the real thing to our customers.
[00:08:00.720 --> 00:08:01.200]   Right.
[00:08:01.200 --> 00:08:01.760]   Exactly.
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:02.920]   So it's going to be $499.
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:06.080]   You get the two controllers, the camera, the headset,
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:08.120]   and a game with a bunch of demos and stuff.
[00:08:08.120 --> 00:08:08.960]   How much is the Rift?
[00:08:08.960 --> 00:08:09.880]   It's $599, right?
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:10.720]   $599.
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:13.840]   And the vibe is $800, $799.
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:14.040]   Yeah.
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:17.680]   So you're still even at $499 lower than anybody else.
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:18.200]   Exactly.
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:18.960]   And plus--
[00:08:18.960 --> 00:08:19.960]   And you're going to have more games.
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.760]   --for almost 40 million PlayStation 4s in the world.
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:24.240]   Yeah.
[00:08:24.240 --> 00:08:27.480]   They're just poised to totally crush it this holiday.
[00:08:27.480 --> 00:08:29.400]   I'm going to get one as soon as I possibly can.
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:31.480]   You got the interactive thing going for you as well,
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:32.840]   which we're still not sure about.
[00:08:32.840 --> 00:08:33.320]   What's that?
[00:08:33.320 --> 00:08:35.160]   Well, just interactive gaming is much easier
[00:08:35.160 --> 00:08:37.320]   with you going to entark community of PS for a PS.
[00:08:37.320 --> 00:08:37.840]   Exactly.
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:40.160]   Who are just aching and willing to play with you.
[00:08:40.160 --> 00:08:42.400]   Oh, so for multiplayer, it's going to be--
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:44.920]   Now VR multiplayer is a challenge,
[00:08:44.920 --> 00:08:47.360]   because, in fact, was it the Sony?
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:51.920]   Somebody was showing at GDC the goofiest ever multiplayer
[00:08:51.920 --> 00:08:53.440]   game you're in with other people.
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:56.200]   You've got giant clown hands.
[00:08:56.200 --> 00:08:59.400]   And whoever was said, I couldn't stop laughing,
[00:08:59.400 --> 00:09:02.200]   but it was awesome.
[00:09:02.200 --> 00:09:03.960]   I was giggling the whole way.
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:06.760]   Oh, I wish I could remember who that was and what was the--
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:08.680]   I'm pretty sure it was a place to--
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:09.280]   No?
[00:09:09.280 --> 00:09:10.400]   Did you go to GDC?
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:11.520]   No, this year, no.
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:12.000]   Anybody?
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:12.520]   No.
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:13.080]   I skipped--
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:13.960]   I sent someone there, but--
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:14.880]   Yeah, we sent somebody.
[00:09:14.880 --> 00:09:15.600]   Yeah.
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.160]   Which is dumb.
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:16.760]   I should have gone.
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:17.960]   It looks like it was a lot of fun.
[00:09:17.960 --> 00:09:18.760]   It was all VR.
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:21.240]   And then you kind of balance that with Apple
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:23.160]   what they're going to announce next week,
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.560]   smaller phone that looks like the same one from two and a half
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:26.320]   years ago.
[00:09:26.320 --> 00:09:27.440]   It's kind of--
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:28.920]   You know, hashtag innovation.
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:31.000]   We should talk about that, because--
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.600]   Well, we'll get to that, because I do feel like--
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:34.680]   that's a very good point.
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:37.280]   I mean, where is Apple's VR solution?
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:38.240]   They've hired people.
[00:09:38.240 --> 00:09:38.600]   Right.
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:40.600]   And supposedly, hundreds of people working on it.
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:41.160]   Yeah.
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.160]   I'm just really excited that if we can have a $500 all in version
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.520]   one of VR for your house, that means in version three,
[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:48.240]   it'll be like $150.
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:49.600]   So this is a pretty good starting point.
[00:09:49.600 --> 00:09:50.960]   Very good place to start.
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:51.440]   Yeah.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.680]   I mean, the first Blu-ray player was $1,000.
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:55.520]   So, you know, I mean, when you've
[00:09:55.520 --> 00:09:58.200]   got a new technology for $500, of course,
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.880]   that's because you have a pretty powerful console.
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:01.080]   True.
[00:10:01.080 --> 00:10:03.600]   Most people already have.
[00:10:03.600 --> 00:10:05.520]   Is it going to be powerful enough?
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:06.240]   The PS4?
[00:10:06.240 --> 00:10:06.560]   Yeah.
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:07.800]   Well, there's an extra box.
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.400]   And I forget what kind of gizmos are inside that extra box
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:11.240]   that you'd hook in--
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:12.240]   So there's additional power.
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:14.520]   So there's a little bit of extra processing
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:15.520]   and there's something around there.
[00:10:15.520 --> 00:10:17.080]   It's a real round packs that you used to be in.
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:19.760]   It actually looks like a mini PS4 that you put into.
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.920]   Oh, wow.
[00:10:21.920 --> 00:10:23.280]   So that helps it out a little bit.
[00:10:23.280 --> 00:10:24.640]   Sony was also rumored.
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:28.040]   I don't know if they confirmed this to be doing another PS4.
[00:10:28.040 --> 00:10:28.960]   This kind of PS4.
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:29.760]   A K1.
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:30.480]   Yeah.
[00:10:30.480 --> 00:10:32.160]   But that's normal for the console life cycle,
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:34.560]   about halfway through a console's life cycle.
[00:10:34.560 --> 00:10:37.200]   They release a minor hardware refresh.
[00:10:37.200 --> 00:10:37.720]   Yeah.
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:38.600]   That's one reason though--
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:39.440]   Come on, the Intel Tech Talk thing.
[00:10:39.440 --> 00:10:39.960]   Exactly.
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:44.480]   You might say that VR--
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:46.320]   while Sony will have a head start,
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.720]   it's still not going to come into its own right away.
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:51.560]   I mean, we're going to see more powerful platforms.
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:54.760]   And consoles, traditionally, don't get updated very often.
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:56.640]   So they may get lapped very quickly
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:11:00.680]   by newer, better technology on the PC side.
[00:11:00.680 --> 00:11:02.520]   Are we due for a console refresh anytime soon?
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:03.040]   No, no.
[00:11:03.040 --> 00:11:03.720]   Nintendo.
[00:11:03.720 --> 00:11:04.200]   Next year.
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:04.720]   Nintendo.
[00:11:04.720 --> 00:11:05.720]   Yeah.
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:06.720]   Are these still one of those?
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:07.720]   Yeah, they're still around.
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:08.240]   They still have a little scum.
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:10.560]   Hey, just for refresh for decades.
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:12.240]   Nintendo will have something next year.
[00:11:12.240 --> 00:11:15.160]   They're off the cycle from Sony and Microsoft.
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:16.880]   It was to work probably three years out from the--
[00:11:16.880 --> 00:11:17.480]   But wasn't it--
[00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:18.640]   10 years from the Xbox?
[00:11:18.640 --> 00:11:19.140]   Yeah.
[00:11:19.140 --> 00:11:19.640]   Yeah.
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:19.640]   Yeah.
[00:11:19.640 --> 00:11:21.040]   The Xbox one, I mean, it was a lot.
[00:11:21.040 --> 00:11:22.080]   It's almost a decade.
[00:11:22.080 --> 00:11:22.600]   Yeah.
[00:11:22.600 --> 00:11:23.640]   How is that still possible?
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:25.400]   I mean, PC has improved so quickly.
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:26.040]   A decade is--
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:26.760]   A different product.
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:27.560]   It's consumer product.
[00:11:27.560 --> 00:11:28.400]   No, not anymore.
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.040]   I mean, Xbox is not just a Windows 10 machine
[00:11:30.040 --> 00:11:31.280]   with a wonky keyboard.
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:33.480]   No.
[00:11:33.480 --> 00:11:34.640]   Yeah.
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:36.640]   I guess I mean, they want to get the maximum value out
[00:11:36.640 --> 00:11:38.400]   of the manufacturing processes that got set up
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:40.720]   so they don't want to change the thing too much.
[00:11:40.720 --> 00:11:43.240]   But the technology moves on.
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:43.960]   But you're right.
[00:11:43.960 --> 00:11:45.520]   If you're actually a PC gamer, then you
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.480]   could swap your cards out a lot more quickly.
[00:11:47.480 --> 00:11:48.480]   Right.
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:50.240]   But yeah, they want to get, I guess,
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.440]   the maximum value out there out of their revenue chain.
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.120]   And then when people are really
[00:11:54.120 --> 00:11:56.000]   aching for it, they'll give them a new console.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.640]   I wonder if the console model itself is really that viable.
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.560]   Now that we have a lot of cross-platform development
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:02.000]   in the Windows community, for example,
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.800]   why do we need to have separate OS-based devices
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:08.440]   when games work across different platforms already?
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:10.200]   It just strikes me as kind of an old-fashioned way
[00:12:10.200 --> 00:12:11.000]   to go about it.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:12.320]   And if we're going to move faster with VR,
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:14.040]   maybe it doesn't make a lot of sense moving forward.
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:18.040]   One of the appeals of consoles, though, is unlike a PC,
[00:12:18.040 --> 00:12:20.280]   there's no-- there is one platform.
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:22.400]   So you develop to one capability.
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:23.480]   It's easy for consumers.
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:25.800]   You buy the disc, or nowadays you download the game.
[00:12:25.800 --> 00:12:26.560]   And it's going to work.
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:29.640]   You don't have to download new drivers for your direct act.
[00:12:29.640 --> 00:12:31.480]   You don't have to update your video card.
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:32.080]   It just works.
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:33.080]   You know it's going to work.
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.440]   It's very plug and play.
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:36.040]   All you need to do is take it out of the box.
[00:12:36.040 --> 00:12:38.600]   The kitty's got a size 8 plug it in, and you're going to go.
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.040]   Right.
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:39.600]   As opposed to developer.
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:41.600]   And for a developer, you know that there's
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:45.600]   38 million PlayStation 4s with all with the same capability.
[00:12:45.600 --> 00:12:47.160]   So that's your market.
[00:12:47.160 --> 00:12:49.280]   I don't-- I think if you develop it with a PC,
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:51.360]   it's hard to even know what your market is.
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:52.640]   Your market's like Steam.
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:53.160]   Steam.
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.120]   Well, Steam helps, doesn't it?
[00:12:54.120 --> 00:12:54.480]   A lot.
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:56.680]   Steam makes a PC more like a console.
[00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:57.160]   Very much so.
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:12:57.640]   Yeah.
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:12:58.920]   So I have a console inside your PC.
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:12:59.440]   Right.
[00:12:59.440 --> 00:13:02.120]   And that's why Vive will be, I think, a very interesting play,
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:03.200]   too, as a VR thing.
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:06.880]   But in all these cases, we're talking about VR as gaming.
[00:13:06.880 --> 00:13:09.360]   Is that ultimately really all VR is going to be?
[00:13:09.360 --> 00:13:11.040]   Is it going to be augmented reality that's
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:13.120]   going to be the new UI?
[00:13:13.120 --> 00:13:15.200]   Or is VR going to move into that territory as well?
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.560]   Is VR just for gaming?
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.360]   No, I mean, it can change everything.
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:20.920]   Or at least it's what people are predicting.
[00:13:20.920 --> 00:13:24.440]   It's the final medium, because it's so malleable and changed.
[00:13:24.440 --> 00:13:25.440]   It's a major thing.
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:26.440]   It's a major thing.
[00:13:26.440 --> 00:13:27.440]   It's a major thing.
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:28.440]   Whatever you want.
[00:13:28.440 --> 00:13:29.440]   So I mean, imagine--
[00:13:29.440 --> 00:13:30.440]   People want to be immersed in their computation.
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:31.920]   Imagine going to a next game.
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:32.920]   Right.
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:34.240]   And you don't actually have to go to the garden.
[00:13:34.240 --> 00:13:35.440]   You just scrap on the--
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.440]   Well, for entertainment, it feels like you're there.
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:38.440]   Entertainment's great.
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:39.440]   Yeah.
[00:13:39.440 --> 00:13:41.440]   Productivity, is there a productivity app?
[00:13:41.440 --> 00:13:42.440]   That's more AR.
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:43.440]   Yeah.
[00:13:43.440 --> 00:13:44.440]   That's a VR.
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:45.440]   VR is for fun.
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:46.440]   Yeah.
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:47.440]   It's been my general mental dichotomy.
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:51.160]   And the real goal here is to eliminate screens.
[00:13:51.160 --> 00:13:52.160]   It's like a mullet?
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:54.160]   It's the mullet of technology.
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:56.160]   OK, we are in the front.
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:13:57.160]   Oh, right.
[00:13:57.160 --> 00:13:58.160]   We are in the front.
[00:13:58.160 --> 00:13:59.160]   We are in the back.
[00:13:59.160 --> 00:14:00.160]   Oh, at five points.
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:01.160]   Sounds good.
[00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:02.160]   Oh, I see.
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:03.160]   That was extremely--
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:05.920]   No, I mean, the problems VR in a business perspective is you can't see your hands.
[00:14:05.920 --> 00:14:06.920]   It's too immersive.
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:07.920]   Yeah.
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:08.920]   So you can't actually create anything.
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:09.920]   You can just absorb information.
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:10.920]   It's about consuming.
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:15.320]   Whereas with AR, you've actually got the ability to build into that.
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:18.880]   What about the nausea factor?
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:21.160]   Isn't some fixed percentage of users--
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:22.160]   It's like 10%.
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:24.400]   But going to get sick when they use it?
[00:14:24.400 --> 00:14:27.160]   I can't think of a product that sold well that sickens its users.
[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:28.160]   Besides cigarettes.
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:29.160]   Wait a minute.
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.160]   Cigarettes are a hollering.
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:31.160]   Cigarettes are a hollering.
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:32.160]   I'm sorry.
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:33.160]   OK, but--
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:36.840]   On the entertainment front, there is a certain subset of content that exists in the world
[00:14:36.840 --> 00:14:40.880]   that has been at the forefront of tech innovation for online payments and video streaming.
[00:14:40.880 --> 00:14:41.880]   I know where you're going.
[00:14:41.880 --> 00:14:42.880]   And so I'm very curious--
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:45.120]   Was talking performance of negotiable affection?
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:46.120]   Yes, exactly.
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:47.120]   Yes.
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:48.120]   Of course.
[00:14:48.120 --> 00:14:49.120]   Of course.
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:50.120]   I'm trying to keep a family friendly.
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:51.120]   Oh, no, porn.
[00:14:51.120 --> 00:14:52.120]   I'm curious if negotiable.
[00:14:52.120 --> 00:14:53.120]   You might actually root.
[00:14:53.120 --> 00:14:54.120]   I'm already censored now.
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.120]   OK, cool.
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:56.120]   Oh, no.
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:15:02.120]   My only thought was, do you think that's going to be an important content for VR and AR?
[00:15:02.120 --> 00:15:04.040]   And if so, where will it land?
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:06.040]   I think it's going to be huge.
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.040]   And I think no one's going to talk about it.
[00:15:08.040 --> 00:15:09.040]   They're already talking about it.
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:10.040]   Just like the internet.
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:12.760]   But no, it's probably the number one thing people do on the internet.
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:15.080]   But no one admits that.
[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:17.440]   Yeah, I mean, I haven't experienced it myself.
[00:15:17.440 --> 00:15:19.280]   I've seen videos of people who are doing it.
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:20.280]   I have.
[00:15:20.280 --> 00:15:23.160]   I mean, do you get any kind of--
[00:15:23.160 --> 00:15:25.320]   It's so immersive that it's scary.
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:26.320]   Ooh.
[00:15:26.320 --> 00:15:27.320]   That you--
[00:15:27.320 --> 00:15:28.320]   OK.
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.640]   Well, you're in the game.
[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:30.640]   You're in it.
[00:15:30.640 --> 00:15:31.640]   I didn't try.
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:32.640]   I know people who tried that demo.
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:33.960]   Why is it that you guys haven't tried it?
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:34.960]   It's so easy.
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:36.880]   You just download it and you put it on your helmet.
[00:15:36.880 --> 00:15:37.880]   It's in Gear VR.
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:38.880]   I just speak.
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:43.240]   I don't know how to name it yet.
[00:15:43.240 --> 00:15:45.640]   If you don't have a Gear VR, I mean, that's easy to do.
[00:15:45.640 --> 00:15:47.240]   And there are a number of--
[00:15:47.240 --> 00:15:48.240]   It's not as old as it.
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:49.240]   But I mean, it's about--
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:50.440]   All the players are doing it.
[00:15:50.440 --> 00:15:52.440]   Well, the problem with the cardboard, you have to hold it with your hands.
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.440]   You want your hands free.
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:54.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:55.440]   All right.
[00:15:55.440 --> 00:15:56.440]   Ah, class.
[00:15:56.440 --> 00:15:57.880]   Can we cut this part out?
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:59.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:01.040]   I don't know how big it'll be.
[00:16:01.040 --> 00:16:02.040]   That's an interesting question.
[00:16:02.040 --> 00:16:06.480]   Because this is-- and this is in general my problem with VR is it's a considerable additional
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:07.480]   cost.
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:11.400]   There is this issue of kind of just even getting used to it.
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:14.640]   And the potential nausea issue.
[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:23.480]   My sense is that adult content like that flourishes in an environment of easy accessibility.
[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.840]   The simpler it is, the better.
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:28.200]   The more expensive it is, but the easier it is.
[00:16:28.200 --> 00:16:31.920]   That's what's been pushing all this technology is easy access.
[00:16:31.920 --> 00:16:40.760]   By adding an extra device and the extra cost and the difficulty, besides that, you can't
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:42.480]   tell if anybody's watching you.
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:46.360]   Ah, the old mother leaving the seat of the cup of tea beside you.
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:47.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:47.360 --> 00:16:48.360]   It's on a thing.
[00:16:48.360 --> 00:16:49.360]   Has that happened to you?
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:50.360]   No, no.
[00:16:50.360 --> 00:16:51.360]   That's a terrible thought.
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:52.360]   Do you still hold it home?
[00:16:52.360 --> 00:16:53.360]   No, no, no.
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:54.360]   It's an old urban myth.
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:57.520]   The story has been repeated over the internet for two decades now, as probably in check,
[00:16:57.520 --> 00:17:01.320]   of the person pleasuring himself with the headphones on in his eyes shut.
[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:04.520]   And when he finishes the open desires, he finds a warm cup of tea and a pint of biscuits
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:05.520]   by the sack of beverage.
[00:17:05.520 --> 00:17:06.520]   He apparently drops it.
[00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:07.520]   Just thought you might need a little bit of--
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:08.520]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:09.520]   --refrescual.
[00:17:09.520 --> 00:17:10.520]   You like to have to.
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:11.520]   Yeah.
[00:17:11.520 --> 00:17:12.520]   I don't like a red bit.
[00:17:12.520 --> 00:17:15.440]   But before I give the wrong idea about my country, I would say I don't think anyone's
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.600]   going to buy a VR headset just for pull.
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:18.600]   I don't think so at all.
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:21.920]   I think this might be the first time that it doesn't forward tick though.
[00:17:21.920 --> 00:17:22.920]   Yeah.
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:25.920]   The point about reducing friction is really important in that context.
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:29.760]   I'm just curious to see where version three, don't laugh, don't laugh, hold it on.
[00:17:29.760 --> 00:17:33.400]   Wear version three of VR is when it's very cheap and just kind of pervasive.
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:37.800]   Because the smartphone revolution really had a bigger cultural impact once we all had one.
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:40.800]   It took a couple years, like five after the iPhone.
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:45.440]   I wonder if the adoption curve will be faster in VR or it will be niche long term.
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:46.440]   Yeah.
[00:17:46.440 --> 00:17:47.440]   I don't know.
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:48.440]   What, Jason?
[00:17:48.440 --> 00:17:52.840]   Raymond Wong at Mashable tried on the VR porn during CES 2016.
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:53.840]   Yeah.
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:56.120]   And we have a video of him experiencing it.
[00:17:56.120 --> 00:17:57.560]   Oh, this is a great video.
[00:17:57.560 --> 00:17:58.720]   I've seen this.
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:04.680]   By the way, he's doing it with a gold Galaxy S7.
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:05.680]   Virtual reality.
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:06.680]   Virtual reality.
[00:18:06.680 --> 00:18:08.520]   Experience your first threesome.
[00:18:08.520 --> 00:18:11.320]   When my records show this same thing.
[00:18:11.320 --> 00:18:12.920]   Yeah, that was my, that's exact.
[00:18:12.920 --> 00:18:13.920]   Oh, stop.
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:14.920]   We don't want to show this.
[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:15.920]   I am.
[00:18:15.920 --> 00:18:16.920]   But that's exactly my reaction is whoa.
[00:18:16.920 --> 00:18:19.840]   Like, whoa, oh, no, no.
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.560]   Stroking my penis.
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:22.560]   Okay.
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:25.760]   This is really not appropriate for our show.
[00:18:25.760 --> 00:18:28.160]   So we're all coming like this.
[00:18:28.160 --> 00:18:29.160]   Yeah.
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:30.160]   Okay.
[00:18:30.160 --> 00:18:31.160]   Yeah.
[00:18:31.160 --> 00:18:32.160]   To see more pay here.
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:33.960]   There's a good reason why we don't talk about it.
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:34.960]   Yeah.
[00:18:34.960 --> 00:18:35.960]   Yeah.
[00:18:35.960 --> 00:18:36.960]   Also, that's going to be a great use for micropayments, I feel.
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:37.960]   But we just saw.
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:40.960]   Well, carry on going for a minute.
[00:18:40.960 --> 00:18:45.320]   The first person to make it a VR helmet with a quarter slot you're saying is going to do.
[00:18:45.320 --> 00:18:46.320]   Yeah.
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:47.320]   I'm just kicking popping them in.
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:48.320]   Do very well.
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:49.320]   It takes Bitcoin.
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:50.320]   Oh, man, we really this went downhill.
[00:18:50.320 --> 00:18:53.480]   I don't think maybe we shouldn't do the margaritas before the show.
[00:18:53.480 --> 00:18:54.480]   Yeah.
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:55.480]   Maybe the new show.
[00:18:55.480 --> 00:18:56.480]   Oh, well, too late.
[00:18:56.480 --> 00:18:57.480]   I see it in half time.
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:19:00.280]   I'm only going to get more weird over time.
[00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:01.280]   All right.
[00:19:01.280 --> 00:19:02.280]   Let's take a break.
[00:19:02.280 --> 00:19:03.920]   We should talk about Apple because they've got an event on Monday.
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:04.920]   Yeah.
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:05.920]   Two events.
[00:19:05.920 --> 00:19:06.920]   They've got a big event on Tuesday too.
[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:07.920]   They've got a bigger show.
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:11.360]   We've already heard a little bit about the logistics.
[00:19:11.360 --> 00:19:15.240]   You may have to wait in line seven and a half hours if you're lucky enough to get a ticket
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:16.240]   to the Tuesday show.
[00:19:16.240 --> 00:19:17.240]   Do you go to court?
[00:19:17.240 --> 00:19:18.240]   Yes.
[00:19:18.240 --> 00:19:19.240]   Wow.
[00:19:19.240 --> 00:19:21.880]   It's even harder to go to court than it is to get into the Apple event on Monday.
[00:19:21.880 --> 00:19:23.680]   We'll talk about that in just a little bit.
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:28.920]   But first, a word from our sponsor, audible.com.
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:30.680]   We love audible.com.
[00:19:30.680 --> 00:19:32.440]   As you know, I've been a member since 2000.
[00:19:32.440 --> 00:19:34.520]   I had a long commute.
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:39.680]   And the only thing to save me from true road rage was the fact that I was listening.
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:47.040]   I listened to all 21 of the Peter, Patrick O'Brien, Aubrey Matcher in books as I was
[00:19:47.040 --> 00:19:48.040]   driving.
[00:19:48.040 --> 00:19:49.040]   That's a lot.
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:51.200]   That's many, many, many hours.
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:55.000]   Audible has now the last time we checked, it says here, 180,000.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:59.720]   Last time we checked, it was almost a quarter of a million downloadable titles, all kinds
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:00.720]   of literature.
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:01.720]   There's fiction.
[00:20:01.720 --> 00:20:02.720]   There's nonfiction.
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:03.720]   There's science fiction.
[00:20:03.720 --> 00:20:07.600]   They just acquired, and I think this is such a great acquisition, the great courses.
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:13.240]   So you could take college level lectures from the best teachers in the world on subjects
[00:20:13.240 --> 00:20:16.480]   like relativity and medieval history.
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:20.960]   They've got the course that one of the great courses ever, how to listen to and understand
[00:20:20.960 --> 00:20:21.960]   music.
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:23.920]   Just, I loved it.
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:24.920]   And now it's available.
[00:20:24.920 --> 00:20:25.920]   It can be part of your audible subscription.
[00:20:25.920 --> 00:20:27.960]   We're going to give you a chance to listen to two books free.
[00:20:27.960 --> 00:20:32.160]   You'll be going to audible.com/twit and the number two.
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:35.320]   Double.com/twit2 and you're signing up for the platinum account.
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:38.520]   That's two books a month plus the Daily Digest of the New York Times of the Wall Street
[00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:39.520]   Journal.
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:43.000]   All read to you so you can listen in the car while you're doing the dishes while you're
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.280]   walking the dog.
[00:20:44.280 --> 00:20:45.840]   I love it in the gym.
[00:20:45.840 --> 00:20:49.120]   Really puts that treadmill time into good use.
[00:20:49.120 --> 00:20:53.560]   You're going to have a month pick two books, cancel anytime in that first month you'll pay
[00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:54.560]   nothing.
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:58.360]   Those books will be yours to keep the real idea is here's a chance to see what it's like
[00:20:58.360 --> 00:21:00.320]   to be an audible listener.
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:01.800]   I love it.
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:02.800]   You will love it too.
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:04.000]   I don't even know where to start.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:07.600]   I mean that's kind of the first challenge is you want to listen to Harry Potter.
[00:21:07.600 --> 00:21:10.680]   They've got all eight books now free.
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:14.120]   First two books anyway free.
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:16.680]   I'm listening because I'm going to go see Hamilton on Thursday.
[00:21:16.680 --> 00:21:17.680]   I'm going to listen to.
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:20.000]   Oh, that's the great by the way Jim Dale.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.520]   Thank you very much.
[00:21:21.520 --> 00:21:25.000]   They were the last people you'd expect to be involved in anything strange or miscellaneous.
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:26.840]   He acts it out so beautifully.
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:30.040]   Although the British audible has Stephen Fry doing it.
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:32.720]   Oh, the classic which is awesome as well.
[00:21:32.720 --> 00:21:38.800]   So take your paper in the UK get the Harry Potter books there.
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:43.400]   As I said, I'm listening to the Ron Cherno autobiography or not autobiography biography
[00:21:43.400 --> 00:21:45.560]   of Hamilton, which is great.
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:46.560]   I can't wait.
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:48.720]   I'm going to be really prepared for this broadly musical.
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:51.760]   I'm going to know the history before I go.
[00:21:51.760 --> 00:21:57.560]   I want you to go to audible.com/twit2 get your two books right now and enjoy.
[00:21:57.560 --> 00:21:58.560]   You're going to love it.
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:06.160]   I'm telling you audible.com/twit and the number two two books free right now.
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:08.240]   So Apple's event is Monday.
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:09.880]   Anybody got an invite here?
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:10.880]   Steve is going.
[00:22:10.880 --> 00:22:12.280]   I'm the only one going here.
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.920]   You're the only one going here from techinsider.io.
[00:22:14.920 --> 00:22:16.600]   They get invitations still.
[00:22:16.600 --> 00:22:17.800]   Does a register get invites?
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:20.160]   No, we'll be on Apple's black list for somebody.
[00:22:20.160 --> 00:22:22.800]   I think they've forgotten this to win Frank.
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:25.200]   I think I've got I was forgotten to I believe.
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:28.000]   That's okay because it's first of all it's a one infinite loop.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:30.600]   So it's 350 people there abouts is a small theater.
[00:22:30.600 --> 00:22:31.600]   It's a small auditorium.
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:32.600]   Yeah.
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:34.720]   A small demo area too.
[00:22:34.720 --> 00:22:36.560]   There usually is a demo area.
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:43.920]   In this case you'll probably be seeing a new smaller iPhone, a four inch iPhone.
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:46.880]   As you point out, not exactly a cutting edge innovation.
[00:22:46.880 --> 00:22:51.560]   Now, but it's very similar to the one that we got two and a half years ago.
[00:22:51.560 --> 00:22:52.560]   Although I think it'll be interesting.
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:55.400]   One of the questions, will it have 3D touch?
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:56.800]   It sounds like no.
[00:22:56.800 --> 00:23:00.160]   It's weird because that feels like the new UI for iPhones.
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:04.480]   It sounds, I mean, who knows, I mean, that's still up in the air, but it sounds like it's
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:09.160]   basically going to be a success stuffed into a 5S body.
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:11.080]   Or a 6 even, maybe not even a 6S.
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:12.080]   It's a 6S.
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:13.080]   Yeah.
[00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:14.080]   Okay.
[00:23:14.080 --> 00:23:15.080]   Same processor, almost the same camera.
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.480]   Well, the 6S has 3D touch.
[00:23:16.480 --> 00:23:17.480]   Exactly.
[00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:19.560]   So that might be the only exception.
[00:23:19.560 --> 00:23:23.680]   Maybe they haven't cracked how to make the 4 inch work on that screen or that body type
[00:23:23.680 --> 00:23:24.680]   or the level of availability.
[00:23:24.680 --> 00:23:27.680]   It's not available, it's not available, who knows.
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:34.240]   But yeah, I mean, my take on this is it's finally the cheap iPhone people have been dying
[00:23:34.240 --> 00:23:36.560]   for that has all the- We'll see how cheap.
[00:23:36.560 --> 00:23:38.120]   But people are guessing 450s.
[00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:40.320]   Yeah, which is 200 bucks cheaper than the 6S.
[00:23:40.320 --> 00:23:41.320]   That's cheap.
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:45.800]   So 8 gigabytes or do you think they'll put 16 storage that got a guess?
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:48.920]   Which is also a major mistake, but nobody should buy that.
[00:23:48.920 --> 00:23:49.920]   Nobody should buy the 16.
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:52.680]   I mean, they still- I don't think even Apple expects anybody to buy it.
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:56.440]   I think that they have to have a low price and they know you're going to buy the next
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:23:57.440]   one.
[00:23:57.440 --> 00:24:01.720]   Yeah, it's, I mean, Apple structures it such that you have to spend 100 extra bucks from
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:03.920]   the base model.
[00:24:03.920 --> 00:24:07.240]   But yeah, I mean, there are a lot of people who are still hanging on to the 3 1/2 and
[00:24:07.240 --> 00:24:08.800]   4 inch iPhones.
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:13.600]   This is a way to kind of entice them saying, "Hey, we stuffed all this great stuff that
[00:24:13.600 --> 00:24:17.680]   we've added over the years that you've been missing out on in the same form factor that
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:22.080]   you used to in love and it's 200 bucks cheaper than the 6S."
[00:24:22.080 --> 00:24:23.640]   Maybe a big seller.
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:25.720]   Sounds like a lot of people, but not most people.
[00:24:25.720 --> 00:24:30.920]   Apple's in this position now and companies get to this position where they're saturated
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:31.920]   the market.
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:35.200]   So they're- the Samsung did this too, where they start trying all sorts of kind of weird
[00:24:35.200 --> 00:24:40.080]   sizes and shapes and just trying to find a little wedge into a newer market.
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.440]   So that's clearly what this is.
[00:24:41.440 --> 00:24:48.360]   And iPhone sales, if you look at them, they're going to decline at this quarter almost certainly.
[00:24:48.360 --> 00:24:53.320]   So this can inject a little artificial growth into it by kind of forcing these people to
[00:24:53.320 --> 00:24:59.320]   have been hanging on to a 5 or even a 4S for 2 1/2, 3 or more years.
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:02.320]   They might finally feel like, "Okay, it's time for me to upgrade because I don't have-
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:04.720]   I can get the device I'm comfortable with.
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:07.920]   I don't have to get this massive screen if I don't like it."
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:12.640]   What was really the case is that iPhone users are not early adopters, they're not generally
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:13.640]   cutting edge.
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:17.840]   And so this is probably a good market for Apple to tap into.
[00:25:17.840 --> 00:25:18.840]   Which market is this?
[00:25:18.840 --> 00:25:21.320]   Is this for the US market, the European market, the Asian market?
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:23.040]   There's such cheap phones everywhere else.
[00:25:23.040 --> 00:25:25.320]   I don't think they can compete with a $50 phone.
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:26.320]   Okay.
[00:25:26.320 --> 00:25:29.520]   So this is still aimed at North America and other wealthy Western nations.
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:30.520]   Exactly.
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:31.520]   Okay.
[00:25:31.520 --> 00:25:32.520]   Maybe China.
[00:25:32.520 --> 00:25:33.520]   Okay.
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:35.080]   They've been- China sales initially propped up Apple.
[00:25:35.080 --> 00:25:36.080]   Yeah.
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:39.320]   They even sold Xiaomi and now Huawei's running away with it over there.
[00:25:39.320 --> 00:25:40.320]   Yeah.
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:41.320]   So Lenovo.
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:46.440]   Not the best- I just- I just- Okay, I'm not an iPhone user and my wife likes the little
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:49.200]   iPhones because she holds them in her hand, she's got small hands.
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:52.480]   But the prevailing trend in the industry has been to larger and larger-
[00:25:52.480 --> 00:25:53.480]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:54.480]   Excited.
[00:25:54.480 --> 00:25:55.480]   It's within reason.
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:57.960]   I mean, if you go up to beyond six and a bit into phablet territory, then-
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:02.040]   But I remember when people mocked me for carrying a note, the first note of the second
[00:26:02.040 --> 00:26:05.240]   note, and it's now it's a normal- It would be a normal-size phone.
[00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:06.240]   It's a fine- Yeah.
[00:26:06.240 --> 00:26:07.240]   It's a fine- Yeah.
[00:26:07.240 --> 00:26:08.240]   It's a fine- Yeah.
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:09.240]   And we were begging Apple for what?
[00:26:09.240 --> 00:26:10.240]   Two or three years?
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:11.240]   Yeah.
[00:26:11.240 --> 00:26:13.800]   Please make a big iPhone and it spurred this mega upgrade cycle, their iPhone 6.
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:17.520]   Maybe they were- Maybe they were- They were all- They shattered records.
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:22.400]   This is kind of a way to go back and court the people who didn't upgrade in that mega
[00:26:22.400 --> 00:26:23.400]   upgrade.
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:24.400]   Yeah.
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:25.920]   So what I love is all the Apple fans are like, "Oh, your phones are big.
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:26.920]   Ha ha, it's a lot of tablet."
[00:26:26.920 --> 00:26:27.920]   And then the iPhone 6 cannot- Oh, yeah.
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:28.920]   And they all got it immediately.
[00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:31.920]   It's like, "Guys, this is- You know what, the quick one is-
[00:26:31.920 --> 00:26:34.360]   The nice thing about- Steve, you've got one.
[00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:36.160]   The 6S Plus is battery life is phenomenal.
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:37.160]   Oh yeah, it's amazing.
[00:26:37.160 --> 00:26:38.920]   Although- But battery life is great on that guy too.
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:40.800]   The new Galaxy S7.
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:42.320]   You know what's really funny is- I have that phone call.
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:46.680]   All the Android people are freaking out because there was a rumor that the next version of
[00:26:46.680 --> 00:26:50.520]   Android- Android Nutroll- I'm going to call it that until they give it a better name.
[00:26:50.520 --> 00:26:51.520]   Oh my.
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:52.520]   Oh my.
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:53.520]   Now get Nutroll.
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:54.520]   When you go in that role.
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:56.160]   I think that everybody thinks it's going to be telling.
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:26:58.760]   But the first screenshots didn't have an app drawer.
[00:26:58.760 --> 00:27:01.600]   Oh, that was- And the LG G5 doesn't have an app drawer.
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:02.600]   They took it out.
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:04.400]   And Android people are going freaking out.
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:05.400]   There's no app drawer.
[00:27:05.400 --> 00:27:06.400]   There's never been an app drawer.
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:07.400]   I wish it was one.
[00:27:07.400 --> 00:27:08.800]   iPhone will never have an app drawer.
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:13.320]   And really, you have to make a folder for your junk stuff and then put it on the last
[00:27:13.320 --> 00:27:14.640]   page so you don't have to see it.
[00:27:14.640 --> 00:27:15.640]   You can't.
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:17.480]   Every app is there.
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:20.160]   They say they're going to solve that soon.
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:22.960]   Tim Cook even said- It was almost- It was almost- He hinted.
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:23.960]   He hinted.
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:26.560]   You'll be able to delete files you don't want to- You'll be able to delete or hide them
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:27.560]   at least.
[00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:29.400]   So maybe that means some sort of app drawer.
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:30.960]   But I mean, it's just silly.
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:33.000]   That's not- Apple has the resources.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.200]   And certainly they have the knowledge, the marketing cloud.
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:39.840]   They know, they must know that they're a little behind.
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:41.680]   And they also must know for every- Do they not care?
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:42.680]   I don't think they care.
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:43.680]   No.
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:46.920]   I mean, if you went back to the original iPhone, which I owned and pulled up the main screen
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:47.920]   and held it- Looks the same.
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:48.920]   You look exactly the same.
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:49.920]   There's more icons.
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:52.040]   But things- You can do a lot more stuff now.
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:54.920]   I'm not saying the phones haven't gotten better, but the core UI has really been very
[00:27:54.920 --> 00:27:55.920]   consistent.
[00:27:55.920 --> 00:27:56.920]   And I think people like that comfortability.
[00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:01.280]   I mean, when they took away the start bar and windows, which no one actually used, people
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:02.760]   lost it and they put it back in.
[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:03.760]   Oh, this is scary.
[00:28:03.760 --> 00:28:05.760]   I just got a cup of tea and biscuits.
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:06.760]   Oh my god.
[00:28:06.760 --> 00:28:07.760]   And you all have the news.
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:08.760]   Are you in VR right now?
[00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:09.760]   Wow.
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:10.760]   Wow.
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:19.440]   Yeah, but I mean, if they're going to make a radical change to the UI of that magnitude,
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:22.120]   I think they're going to do it very slowly and deliberately and get it right the first
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:26.000]   time because you will make people so, so very mad if you change their home.
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:27.760]   And smartphones are home now.
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:31.080]   Samsung, a couple of years ago, had an ad campaign implying basically the iPhone was
[00:28:31.080 --> 00:28:32.080]   your mom's phone.
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:32.920]   Oh, for the old-
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:33.440]   Oh, for the old-
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:34.440]   The old-
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:34.440]   The old-
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:35.440]   The old-
[00:28:35.440 --> 00:28:39.000]   It wasn't so wrong and yet it, I don't know if it worked.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:41.320]   That fact that was the year the S5 tanked.
[00:28:41.320 --> 00:28:45.840]   Well, that whole campaign, they were even doing that before, like a run the S-3 and S4.
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:48.360]   That whole campaign just boosted Samsung so much.
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:49.360]   So it's their best campaign ever.
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:52.160]   That's why we still talk Samsung versus Apple.
[00:28:52.160 --> 00:28:54.000]   So whether they're correct in that assessment-
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:57.760]   You have to look at the S7 though and say that in every way now that they have invested
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:00.960]   Apple, I don't see the camera looking clean.
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:02.960]   Better camera.
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:05.760]   The flexibility of having different launchers.
[00:29:05.760 --> 00:29:08.840]   I mean, one of the answers to people will say, "Well, where's the launchers?"
[00:29:08.840 --> 00:29:11.360]   Well, just use one of many different launchers.
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:13.920]   You don't have to use the stock launcher.
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:17.760]   I've got to say, you do wonder whether Apple is starting to lose it a bit on the design
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:18.760]   front.
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:21.960]   It's, Johnny Ive has not turned out the smartwatch-
[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:25.000]   Which ones you rather have or hold?
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   This one, I mean-
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:29.360]   Let me take the case off.
[00:29:29.360 --> 00:29:31.400]   It's the same size screen, but it's smaller.
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:32.400]   It's so much smaller.
[00:29:32.400 --> 00:29:34.600]   It's not really a hole.
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:37.040]   This thing feels like I'm carrying an anvil around in my pocket.
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:41.800]   I have both and I use both, but when the S7 came out, I put the iPhone 6 in a drawer
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:47.600]   because I missed the flexibility of Android, really.
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:49.960]   The Apple Watch is still a better watch than Android Wear.
[00:29:49.960 --> 00:29:50.960]   There's no question about that.
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:51.960]   Yeah, that's not exactly much though.
[00:29:51.960 --> 00:29:52.960]   I mean-
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:57.920]   It's not Android for the smartwatch, which has anyone has gone, "Wow, that's cool."
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:00.200]   There'll be absolutely none of them, actually.
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:01.200]   Yes, exactly.
[00:30:01.200 --> 00:30:05.520]   We will see Apple, you know, the invite said in the loop.
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:08.880]   And of course, it is literally in the loop, one infinite loop.
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:12.440]   But then somebody said, "Well, you know, they do call those bands, Milanese Loop.
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:15.000]   We expect a black Milanese Loop, for instance."
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.720]   But then somebody sent me an email, which I thought was intriguing.
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.960]   What if we start seeing sensors in the bands?
[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:22.120]   Maybe these new bands are more than just bands.
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:23.120]   Is it someone working on-
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:24.960]   Isn't a Vic and Docho working on-
[00:30:24.960 --> 00:30:25.960]   Yeah, he has a-
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:27.960]   Yeah, it's a Apple Core.
[00:30:27.960 --> 00:30:29.400]   It's an F-
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:33.800]   Yeah, it's one of the first FDA approved devices for-
[00:30:33.800 --> 00:30:35.800]   I think it measures heart.
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:36.800]   Some-
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:37.800]   I can't remember, I'll look at that.
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:41.360]   And it's not until that the watch and other world levels where we get really exciting,
[00:30:41.360 --> 00:30:44.920]   when they can do more than just kind of track your steps and artificially track your heart
[00:30:44.920 --> 00:30:45.920]   rate-
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:46.920]   Right.
[00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:47.920]   If they can get the resting heart rate right, if they can do-
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:48.920]   A live-
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:49.920]   Oration and all that.
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:52.120]   Also, quickly, if they can do it without your phone being within Bluetooth-
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:53.120]   Exactly.
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:54.120]   Until that open solo-
[00:30:54.120 --> 00:30:55.600]   They're all a bunch of pooey.
[00:30:55.600 --> 00:30:58.960]   Right, but also we're for the biggest dorks on the planet, and not one of us is wearing
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:30:59.960]   an Apple Watch right now.
[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:02.120]   I'm wearing a wear and a red wear of all things.
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:03.680]   I know that's why your wrist looks funny.
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:06.000]   Oh, I think it looks like an actual watch.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   It's round for once.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.440]   Actually, it kind of looks like an actual watch from about the 1800s when they had-
[00:31:10.440 --> 00:31:13.920]   Did you wind that with a spring?
[00:31:13.920 --> 00:31:16.720]   It has a fervent dirt for you.
[00:31:16.720 --> 00:31:17.720]   Oh, of course.
[00:31:17.720 --> 00:31:18.720]   I've never danned too.
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.520]   Yeah, the Apple Watch is better.
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:22.160]   Oh, look, it's raining.
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:23.200]   It says so on my watch.
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.200]   It must be-
[00:31:24.200 --> 00:31:25.200]   We have a window.
[00:31:25.200 --> 00:31:26.200]   It must be true.
[00:31:26.200 --> 00:31:30.280]   It must be- I wanted it to an Instagram picture of raindrops on the watch telling me that
[00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:31.280]   it's raining.
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:33.440]   I did a quick count-up before I get on Friday.
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:36.440]   We have five smart watches hanging around the office.
[00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:37.440]   Yeah.
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:39.200]   Completely deep-powered because nobody wants to wear it.
[00:31:39.200 --> 00:31:40.200]   Nobody wants them.
[00:31:40.200 --> 00:31:43.680]   It's just, you know, we can't get rid of the things and the companies won't take them
[00:31:43.680 --> 00:31:45.680]   back, so you'll be too.
[00:31:45.680 --> 00:31:46.680]   You just leave them.
[00:31:46.680 --> 00:31:47.680]   Yeah.
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:49.760]   But if you go back to the VR discussion we had about 20 minutes ago, we were all very
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:54.040]   excited, and then we brought up smart watches, and then we all went, "Ah, I'll have a drink."
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:55.040]   Yeah.
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:56.040]   We'll be level drop by what?
[00:31:56.040 --> 00:31:57.040]   50%.
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:58.040]   Right.
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:00.040]   That, I think, is the whole story because we're the people who are going to buy these
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:01.040]   things.
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:02.040]   Yeah.
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:03.040]   If early adopters aren't excited, then you're really out of luck.
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:06.440]   Oh, we're still excited about smartphones, and that's why Apple's event tomorrow might
[00:32:06.440 --> 00:32:10.240]   seem a little boring, but I wrote this this week.
[00:32:10.240 --> 00:32:14.600]   Apple is a one-trick pony, and it's smartphones, but they happen to make the best one-
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:15.600]   Right.
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:16.600]   Best-selling one.
[00:32:16.600 --> 00:32:18.600]   Best-selling one, at least.
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:23.360]   And right now, that's the only trick that matters, and, you know, VR is cool and exciting.
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:26.800]   It's fun to see all these companies come out with it, but is it a mainstream product
[00:32:26.800 --> 00:32:27.800]   yet?
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:29.160]   No, it's for hardcore gamers right now.
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.160]   Right.
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:31.160]   Right.
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:32.160]   It doesn't mean Apple is totally ignoring the trend.
[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:33.160]   Of course not.
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:35.240]   They have hundreds of people researching this.
[00:32:35.240 --> 00:32:40.840]   Tim Cook even said, "Do you research a lot of things, but it's not really a deal."
[00:32:40.840 --> 00:32:44.400]   He was talking about the car until we fired.
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:47.600]   I can't remember what the number was, like thousands of engineers.
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:51.080]   They can, a hundred engineers just means mild interest for them.
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:52.280]   They've got so much money.
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:53.280]   Right.
[00:32:53.280 --> 00:32:54.280]   Absolutely.
[00:32:54.280 --> 00:32:56.120]   They've hired some of the best VR people, actually.
[00:32:56.120 --> 00:32:57.120]   Yeah.
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:58.560]   But it doesn't mean they're going to do it.
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:00.080]   It just means, "Well, we have the money.
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:01.080]   We should just exactly..."
[00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:02.080]   What do we do?
[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:03.880]   It's like a billion years earlier in the intersection.
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:05.280]   I don't think they need to do it.
[00:33:05.280 --> 00:33:07.840]   Do you want to walk around with a giant headset on you right now?
[00:33:07.840 --> 00:33:08.840]   That's what it looks like now.
[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:10.240]   That's where the technology is right now.
[00:33:10.240 --> 00:33:14.960]   But the pressure's got to be, at some point, at least internally on Apple, to find a follow-up
[00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:15.960]   to the iPhone.
[00:33:15.960 --> 00:33:16.960]   Of course.
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:18.160]   And now is the time, right?
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:19.160]   And is it the iPad?
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:20.160]   No, I don't think so.
[00:33:20.160 --> 00:33:21.160]   Of course not.
[00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:22.160]   No.
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:23.160]   And that's not even replacing the MacBook yet.
[00:33:23.160 --> 00:33:24.640]   And investors are very nervous about this.
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:27.640]   So if you look at Apple's stock price over the last five to seven years, they've really
[00:33:27.640 --> 00:33:31.080]   plateaued a little bit recently because people now realize, to Steve's point, they are a
[00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:32.080]   one-trick pony.
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:36.240]   Max sales, small, iPad sales, and decline, Apple Watch sales, very modest.
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:38.520]   And if iPhone goes flat, then what's the...
[00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:39.520]   Or down.
[00:33:39.520 --> 00:33:40.520]   Or down.
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:41.520]   Which is how many of you...
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:42.520]   Yeah.
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:43.520]   Which is the...
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:44.520]   Yeah.
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:45.520]   What's the next upward lever?
[00:33:45.520 --> 00:33:46.520]   And if you say Apple TV, I will laugh at you.
[00:33:46.520 --> 00:33:47.520]   It's definitely not TV.
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:48.520]   It's not cars either.
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:49.520]   Can they sell...
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:50.520]   No.
[00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:51.520]   No.
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:55.760]   Apple Car Thing is a huge, you know, sort of red herring.
[00:33:55.760 --> 00:33:58.800]   I think coming to your point, they've got a real problem.
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:03.760]   Unless they can get their iPhone Mojo back, then Chinese manufacturers doing cheap phones,
[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:06.880]   which look good enough, are going to eat their lunch completely.
[00:34:06.880 --> 00:34:09.920]   Well, that's been the story for years, and that hasn't happened yet.
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:15.360]   Well, you know, the one we're watching right now, of course, is it the wah-wee, the me,
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:16.360]   the new me.
[00:34:16.360 --> 00:34:17.360]   The Xiaomi.
[00:34:17.360 --> 00:34:18.360]   Xiaomi.
[00:34:18.360 --> 00:34:19.360]   Xiaomi.
[00:34:19.360 --> 00:34:20.360]   Xiaomi.
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:21.360]   Yeah.
[00:34:21.360 --> 00:34:22.360]   It's actually good, yeah.
[00:34:22.360 --> 00:34:23.360]   It's an 8-snap-dragging 820.
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:26.880]   It's a very credible phone, 250 bucks.
[00:34:26.880 --> 00:34:27.880]   That's really cheap.
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:28.880]   Yeah.
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:29.880]   Unlocked.
[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:33.960]   And now they've never sold these in the US, but there is considerable thought that they
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:34.960]   may.
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:35.960]   That may be...
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:37.800]   This may be the one where they introduced it in the US.
[00:34:37.800 --> 00:34:39.600]   We've been waiting for it, but it's not interesting.
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:40.600]   Wouldn't that be interesting?
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:42.200]   I've tried some of the phones out.
[00:34:42.200 --> 00:34:43.440]   I'm really impressed with them.
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:47.120]   They've got some great software on them.
[00:34:47.120 --> 00:34:52.280]   They're not going to beat Apple immediately in anything like a premium market because
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:53.280]   they are cheap.
[00:34:53.280 --> 00:34:58.680]   But if it's a choice between spending half the price on a phone, which is 95% is good,
[00:34:58.680 --> 00:35:03.200]   I don't know that iOS and Mac OS is going to have enough to hold them there.
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:08.160]   And you're right, we have been saying this for years, but it's growing slowly but surely.
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:09.160]   Yeah.
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:13.920]   3,000 milliamp hour battery, 4 gigs of RAM 60 megapixel camera, 5-inch screen, 1920 screen.
[00:35:13.920 --> 00:35:16.120]   It's not like you need to snap-dragging that.
[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:22.120]   And at that price, I have to think that this is the biggest market in the US.
[00:35:22.120 --> 00:35:25.920]   There's the premium market, which we all participate in, so we're a little bit in a
[00:35:25.920 --> 00:35:26.920]   bubble.
[00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:32.120]   But most people don't want to spend $800 for this phone.
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:34.320]   That's more than their computer costs.
[00:35:34.320 --> 00:35:35.440]   Yeah, but they don't see it that way.
[00:35:35.440 --> 00:35:37.080]   They see now the way carriers.
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:38.080]   Oh, they're starting to.
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:40.640]   The carriers are starting to start sharing it such that you pay 30 bucks a month.
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:41.840]   It's like a used-hanger phone.
[00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:43.320]   I think people are starting to get...
[00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:44.640]   These are not subsidized anymore.
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:45.880]   They're starting to get what they're paying.
[00:35:45.880 --> 00:35:50.120]   I think that's one of the reasons something like a Xiaomi 5 might have an opportunity.
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:53.880]   At $250 a pop, if you dropped it and broke the screen, you could just buy a new one.
[00:35:53.880 --> 00:35:55.800]   Yeah, and by the way, I already broke in my S7.
[00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:56.800]   That's amazing scratches.
[00:35:56.800 --> 00:35:57.960]   Yeah, mine looks like that too.
[00:35:57.960 --> 00:36:02.960]   This thing is slippery, like a little fishy in your hand and breaks.
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:04.200]   I didn't do anything too much.
[00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:05.200]   Trivially.
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:06.800]   I have a crack on the bottom of mine.
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:07.800]   It's like that.
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:08.800]   Yeah.
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:10.400]   Yeah, everyone I know who has this mid-sevent is cracked.
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:11.400]   It's bad.
[00:36:11.400 --> 00:36:14.160]   But I put it in a case and you'll never see it.
[00:36:14.160 --> 00:36:15.160]   I hope.
[00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:16.160]   I don't crack the front.
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:18.720]   All right, they're also going to announce a new iPad.
[00:36:18.720 --> 00:36:21.800]   We're pretty sure an iPad Pro 10-inch version.
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:25.520]   Again, this is very much like nibbling around at the corners trying to find a new market
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:28.680]   for something that is not growing.
[00:36:28.680 --> 00:36:30.320]   It's not going to change the equation.
[00:36:30.320 --> 00:36:32.920]   The iPad still hasn't convinced me, especially the Pro.
[00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:36.560]   I mean, it was the keyboard that came with it was terrible.
[00:36:36.560 --> 00:36:38.280]   It was awful to type on.
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:42.320]   The letters actually fade off of it when you type on it too much.
[00:36:42.320 --> 00:36:44.040]   And they're claiming it replaces bad.
[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:45.440]   And they claim it replaces your laptop.
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:47.440]   No one knows that because no one's typed on it.
[00:36:47.440 --> 00:36:48.440]   Exactly.
[00:36:48.440 --> 00:36:49.440]   Yeah.
[00:36:49.440 --> 00:36:53.440]   You know, I just I think if you're going to get it we've learned now that iPads have
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:57.280]   a shelf or you hold onto an iPad for what three, four, five years.
[00:36:57.280 --> 00:36:58.280]   Yeah.
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:36:59.280]   We're ready to update it.
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:00.280]   Yeah.
[00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:02.280]   And you give it to the kids and they watch Netflix or YouTube on it.
[00:37:02.280 --> 00:37:03.280]   Now Apple.
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:05.480]   This is not going to inject more excitement to the iPad.
[00:37:05.480 --> 00:37:09.240]   Apple moved this event a week ahead.
[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:12.680]   I've got to think because they wanted to be the day before the court.
[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:13.680]   Oh, totally.
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:14.680]   Which is very cheeky, by the way.
[00:37:14.680 --> 00:37:15.680]   Very cheeky indeed.
[00:37:15.680 --> 00:37:16.840]   Oh, they're cheeky all round.
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:17.840]   I love it.
[00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:23.240]   Don't you think that Tim Cook doing an open letter on the Apple webpage saying we don't
[00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:24.440]   need to be discussion about this?
[00:37:24.440 --> 00:37:25.440]   That's cheeky as hell.
[00:37:25.440 --> 00:37:26.440]   Oh, yeah.
[00:37:26.440 --> 00:37:28.440]   Tim Cook just stopped in the face of a federal court order.
[00:37:28.440 --> 00:37:29.440]   Yeah.
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:30.440]   The same.
[00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:31.440]   We're not going to go.
[00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:32.440]   We're not going to do it.
[00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:33.440]   The FBI was cheeky as hell by the same.
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:37.400]   Well, everybody's cheeky because this the San Bernardino case was picked specifically
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:40.880]   because it's a terrorism case off the gut suspects dead anywhere.
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:41.880]   It's very clear.
[00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:46.360]   What they're really looking for is what they're looking for is case law and they set Apple
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:48.760]   up a juicy and Apple turned round of for them.
[00:37:48.760 --> 00:37:49.760]   I say good luck.
[00:37:49.760 --> 00:37:53.720]   No, I'm glad Tim Cook did that and it turned out to be the right strategy because it's
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:58.280]   not just us, but I think that in general the American populace is aware of this issue.
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:37:59.280]   Yes.
[00:37:59.280 --> 00:38:02.080]   It's aware of privacy and encryption.
[00:38:02.080 --> 00:38:04.640]   It may be a little bit of theater.
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:09.720]   I expect that Tim Cook will begin the event with a little 10 minute making the case.
[00:38:09.720 --> 00:38:15.560]   It'll be his closing argument in effect, making the case which he's preparing as we speak
[00:38:15.560 --> 00:38:20.320]   for why we don't want the FBI to have access to these phones.
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:23.360]   But I think the whole thing is theater from both sides.
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:24.360]   Oh, yeah.
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:26.720]   Because we really live in a surveillance society.
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:27.720]   Yeah.
[00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:31.840]   Well, I mean, this is what the FBI was talking to a lot of guys at RSA about this and the
[00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:37.760]   feeling was pretty much universal in that up until we started getting full encryption
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:42.320]   on iPhones and same with Android phones and Snowden started leaking out from snowing on.
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:43.800]   You can blame Snowden for all of this, right?
[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:44.800]   Yeah.
[00:38:44.800 --> 00:38:48.160]   I mean, up until then, if you said, oh, the government is collecting dossier's on everyone's
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:52.680]   internet habits, you would have been laughed out the room as a tin forehat wearing nut job.
[00:38:52.680 --> 00:38:56.720]   Then when the stuff came out, it was just like, oh, well, maybe they are, but I'm sure
[00:38:56.720 --> 00:38:57.720]   it's all very safe.
[00:38:57.720 --> 00:39:04.040]   Apple and Google responded perfectly well to what is a customer demand for secure communications
[00:39:04.040 --> 00:39:08.000]   and the FBI panicked when they realized all this lovely stuff, which means we can just
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:12.240]   sit in an office and scan stuff rather than going out and doing police work.
[00:39:12.240 --> 00:39:18.320]   Then I would, you know, Neil Stevenson says, relying on encryption is like a guy living
[00:39:18.320 --> 00:39:24.680]   in a house with a picket fence that consists of a single picket a mile high that encryption,
[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:30.440]   yes, does work, but there are so many way that you can never eliminate the human factor.
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:32.840]   Encryption doesn't work on a rooted computer.
[00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:34.960]   It doesn't work in general, really.
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:41.000]   And law enforcement has many means, which they know very well to get around all of this.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:43.080]   How do they get silk road, Bitcoin's encrypted?
[00:39:43.080 --> 00:39:45.600]   Well, informants, it's easy.
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:48.320]   And that's how Apple's argument is as well.
[00:39:48.320 --> 00:39:52.080]   But I think Apple's a little disingenuous too, because I think from the marketing point
[00:39:52.080 --> 00:39:56.040]   of view, it's great to tout their phones as being secure, but there is no security.
[00:39:56.040 --> 00:39:58.160]   They're giving up the iCloud backup routinely.
[00:39:58.160 --> 00:40:00.080]   But they also said that out loud.
[00:40:00.080 --> 00:40:02.080]   They draw the line at the device.
[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:03.080]   Yes.
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:05.600]   And look, they're quite proper too, because they don't want to write firmware.
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:06.600]   Exactly.
[00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:10.320]   And in fact, the latest story is that the programmers at Apple probably would walk out.
[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:11.560]   Yeah, for them to do that.
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:14.160]   And they'll be hired in two seconds from anywhere else.
[00:40:14.160 --> 00:40:16.600]   I don't think they could walk down the street to any other company.
[00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:19.520]   Do they face a contempt of court if they walk out?
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:21.080]   No, they're just quitting their job.
[00:40:21.080 --> 00:40:22.080]   Right.
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:26.000]   I don't think legally, we've been trying to find a lawyer who gives a straight answer
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   on this.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:28.880]   But legally, there's really nothing the FBI can do.
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:31.560]   They say, well, if you're going to force me to do this, I quit.
[00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:36.280]   You can't force somebody to provide their labor in a sorry position.
[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:41.800]   Susan Crawford wrote a really interesting piece.
[00:40:41.800 --> 00:40:44.920]   She is an expert in this kind of law.
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:46.720]   I'm trying to remember her title.
[00:40:46.720 --> 00:40:47.720]   Let me find it for you.
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:48.720]   It's on Medium.
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:51.000]   She's a professor at Harvard Law.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:53.120]   She might know about law then.
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:54.960]   Back Channel's tech policy comments.
[00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:58.360]   Back Channel is Stephen Levy's Medium channel for tech writing.
[00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:03.320]   In 2009, she served as Barack Obama's special assistant for science, technology, and innovation
[00:41:03.320 --> 00:41:04.400]   policy.
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:05.920]   The law is clear, she writes.
[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:14.840]   The FBI cannot make Apple rewrites OS because Kalea specifically forbids it.
[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:17.880]   She says, "Everyone said, 'Well, President Obama removes his law professor in chief
[00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:23.320]   hat and puts on his I get terrifying briefings every day hat.'
[00:41:23.320 --> 00:41:28.960]   He said, yeah, he said what he said, but he must know as a constitutional lawyer by
[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:34.160]   training that when Kalea, the communications assistance for law enforcement act, was passed
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:41.120]   by Congress 20 years ago, it made it very clear the government cannot, may not, it is
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:46.560]   as specifically tell manufacturers how to design or configure a phone or software used
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:49.800]   by that phone, including security software used by that phone.
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:54.240]   How's this not been brought up by Apple?
[00:41:54.240 --> 00:41:56.640]   They did bring it up in their last court filing because I did a story about it.
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:42:02.160]   When the Kalea hearings were first done in '94, then they had big congressional committee
[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:06.080]   which, and they got the then director of the FBI who said, 'Yes, of course, we're not
[00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:08.160]   going to force companies to decrypt.
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:11.760]   We'll just take the signals and we'll work it out ourselves, thanks very much.'
[00:42:11.760 --> 00:42:14.160]   Just let us wiretap, that's all we have.
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:15.160]   Yes.
[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:20.600]   And they told me it's turning around and saying, actually no, we haven't probably asked the
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:23.800]   NSA where they can uncapped the chips or anything like that, but if you could just do it for
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:25.360]   us, that would be great.
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:27.240]   You think the law was written in 1789?
[00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:30.960]   This is the All-Ritz Act, and that's what she says, because they can't use Kalea, they're
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:32.880]   going to the All-Ritz Act.
[00:42:32.880 --> 00:42:36.200]   But she says, this was part of the negotiation, this was the tit for tat.
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:41.400]   Congress said, okay, you've got to help them with wiretapping, but in exchange, Section
[00:42:41.400 --> 00:42:46.320]   1002, the feds gave up authority to, quote, require any specific design of equipment,
[00:42:46.320 --> 00:42:50.800]   facilities, services, features, or system configurations from any phone manufacturer.
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:55.800]   That's directly, I mean, there's no question, and I'm surprised to share a pin, the judge
[00:42:55.800 --> 00:43:02.480]   in this federal case didn't know this, but by now she must know this.
[00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:04.360]   This is going to be the surprise on Tuesday.
[00:43:04.360 --> 00:43:10.800]   She can't rule this because it's direct contravention of what Congress clearly mandated.
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:15.360]   I am amazed that Apple just didn't give her this sentence and say, your honor, case closed.
[00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:19.240]   Yeah, I mean, also Apple is an information services provider rather than telecommunications
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:20.240]   provider.
[00:43:20.240 --> 00:43:23.120]   So the full Kalea laws don't even act on the company.
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:25.040]   Except phone manufacturer, they are.
[00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:26.040]   Then they're mentioned.
[00:43:26.040 --> 00:43:27.040]   They are.
[00:43:27.040 --> 00:43:29.680]   So that's the one place Kalea does apply that.
[00:43:29.680 --> 00:43:34.120]   Which explains why they went for the All-Ritz Act approach.
[00:43:34.120 --> 00:43:37.800]   This has just been, I can't not feeling a botched job on behalf of the FBI, and also
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:41.560]   a slightly botched job on behalf of Apple, because they came out saying, we're not going
[00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:43.320]   to put a backdoor on encryption.
[00:43:43.320 --> 00:43:46.520]   And when you look at that specific case, that's not what the FBI were asking for.
[00:43:46.520 --> 00:43:49.080]   They were asking for a way around brute forcing.
[00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:52.320]   But it's clear that they've decided to go all in on this.
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:55.760]   Well, Apple's argument is the brute force is only made possible by writing.
[00:43:55.760 --> 00:43:56.760]   Exactly.
[00:43:56.760 --> 00:43:57.760]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:58.760]   It may not be true.
[00:43:58.760 --> 00:43:59.760]   Yeah.
[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:00.760]   For people who don't know, what's the All-Ritz Act?
[00:44:00.760 --> 00:44:02.400]   Oh, everybody knows that by now.
[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:03.400]   Oh, sorry.
[00:44:03.400 --> 00:44:04.400]   1789.
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:07.400]   But you know, it's a mistake to say that.
[00:44:07.400 --> 00:44:11.240]   It's a mistake to really focus on that, because the All-Ritz Act very simply says that a judge
[00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:14.440]   can do whatever the judge needs to do to get the job done.
[00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:17.160]   It's a two sentence act saying that when the government issues are writ, you've got to
[00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:20.600]   obey it unless certain circumstances come in.
[00:44:20.600 --> 00:44:22.600]   And the FBI has decided to use this to say...
[00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:23.600]   It's a flimsy justification.
[00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:26.640]   Yeah, the FBI has decided to use this saying, well, we're telling you to do it.
[00:44:26.640 --> 00:44:27.640]   So do it.
[00:44:27.640 --> 00:44:28.640]   Right.
[00:44:28.640 --> 00:44:29.640]   And it's...
[00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:30.960]   Why that holds water's on me.
[00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:31.960]   But they've been...
[00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:34.360]   This has been around for a long time for exactly this purpose.
[00:44:34.360 --> 00:44:35.360]   Yeah.
[00:44:35.360 --> 00:44:40.840]   So what's changed is that this is going to be a little more theater on Tuesday, because
[00:44:40.840 --> 00:44:46.600]   before it was just the two lawyers arguing and the judge ruling, the Department of Justice
[00:44:46.600 --> 00:44:52.160]   has asked for witnesses and testimony.
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:56.440]   Now I'm no legal legal, but I was told that that means they think they have a weak case.
[00:44:56.440 --> 00:44:59.240]   That means Apple thinks the FBI has a weak case.
[00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:00.240]   Yeah.
[00:45:00.240 --> 00:45:02.880]   But it was the DOJ that asked for the witnesses, right?
[00:45:02.880 --> 00:45:03.880]   Right.
[00:45:03.880 --> 00:45:05.320]   But the witnesses are calling.
[00:45:05.320 --> 00:45:06.560]   They're not calling Tim Cook.
[00:45:06.560 --> 00:45:09.320]   They're calling Apple's a cryptographer and someone else.
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:10.320]   Well, yeah, some good people.
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:11.320]   Yeah.
[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:15.480]   So it's going to be a really wonky hearing I have a feeling and get really deep into
[00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:16.480]   the nitty gritty of what...
[00:45:16.480 --> 00:45:20.720]   I don't know how it works over here, but by the same corollary, if they're asking for
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:25.680]   witnesses from Apple, Apple can then presumably ask for witnesses from the DOJ, because the
[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:29.280]   one argument they've been saying is, we don't know how to do this.
[00:45:29.280 --> 00:45:33.440]   It's up to you to work out how to do it so that we can decrypt messages when we want
[00:45:33.440 --> 00:45:34.440]   to do it.
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:39.440]   So if they can't find a single government representative who can give a reasonable scheme where this
[00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:40.440]   will happen.
[00:45:40.440 --> 00:45:41.440]   There will be witnesses on both sides.
[00:45:41.440 --> 00:45:42.440]   Yeah.
[00:45:42.440 --> 00:45:43.440]   I mean, that's...
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:44.440]   So this...
[00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:45.440]   I guess they could have just completed...
[00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:48.920]   This was revealed in a conference call Apple held on Friday that on Wednesday, the judge,
[00:45:48.920 --> 00:45:53.520]   the Apple lawyers and the lawyers for the Department of Justice had a conference call
[00:45:53.520 --> 00:45:56.080]   and the FBI requested an evidentiary hearing.
[00:45:56.080 --> 00:45:59.640]   This is something that's within their rights to ask for.
[00:45:59.640 --> 00:46:02.120]   Apple's providing two employees.
[00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:05.920]   One is Eric Newinschwander, who I'm sure I'm mispronouncing that.
[00:46:05.920 --> 00:46:09.440]   Newinschwander is Apple's chief product, security and privacy manager.
[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:11.640]   In other words, they're encryption guru.
[00:46:11.640 --> 00:46:12.640]   Yeah.
[00:46:12.640 --> 00:46:13.640]   He's already given a quote.
[00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:14.640]   That's a bit...
[00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:17.720]   It's a quote declaration on this as well, which is quite clear.
[00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:20.320]   This is a symbolic and not going to fly.
[00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:25.240]   And Lisa Ollie, who's their global law enforcement manager, Apple has to have a global law enforcement
[00:46:25.240 --> 00:46:28.720]   manager to manage law enforcement or quests.
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:30.160]   So that's a full-time job.
[00:46:30.160 --> 00:46:33.800]   The FBI will also have two witnesses.
[00:46:33.800 --> 00:46:38.520]   And so the hearings begin at one o'clock Pacific time, but the judge has warned they'll be
[00:46:38.520 --> 00:46:39.520]   handing out tickets.
[00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:41.880]   There's a small courtroom, there'll be an overflow room.
[00:46:41.880 --> 00:46:48.120]   The courtroom, I think, is 35 people, half of whom will be Apple and DOJ employees.
[00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:52.560]   And then there's a 350-seat overflow theater.
[00:46:52.560 --> 00:46:53.560]   And you'll have to get tickets.
[00:46:53.560 --> 00:46:55.560]   Tickets will be issued at seven in the morning on Tuesday.
[00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:57.320]   Oh, no, that's so early.
[00:46:57.320 --> 00:47:01.560]   Well, you need to be there early because they can only get, they say, 10 people an hour
[00:47:01.560 --> 00:47:03.680]   through the security.
[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:04.680]   Or is it 30 people?
[00:47:04.680 --> 00:47:05.680]   It's going to be...
[00:47:05.680 --> 00:47:06.680]   30 people...
[00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:07.680]   It's slow.
[00:47:07.680 --> 00:47:08.680]   I've been through courtroom security.
[00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:09.680]   They really go through it.
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:13.800]   And so they say an estimated seven and a half hours to get everybody into the courtroom.
[00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:14.800]   So it's going to be tight.
[00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:16.120]   So bring lunch if you're going.
[00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:18.560]   They also said that there's no food.
[00:47:18.560 --> 00:47:19.640]   There's a snack machine.
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:20.640]   Bring lunch.
[00:47:20.640 --> 00:47:21.640]   It's going to be very...
[00:47:21.640 --> 00:47:24.280]   I still think I don't hang out the legal system very often.
[00:47:24.280 --> 00:47:25.480]   They don't party very well.
[00:47:25.480 --> 00:47:26.480]   This is not...
[00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:28.480]   No more than a 5 p.m.
[00:47:28.480 --> 00:47:29.480]   Yeah.
[00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:30.480]   That's good.
[00:47:30.480 --> 00:47:31.480]   I'll take that.
[00:47:31.480 --> 00:47:33.480]   Yeah, it's a short day.
[00:47:33.480 --> 00:47:36.000]   I wish they would broadcast this.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   Oh, I know.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.520]   This would rival the OJ.
[00:47:38.520 --> 00:47:40.240]   Yeah, it would be...
[00:47:40.240 --> 00:47:42.240]   Well, tech-eaks it, rival.
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:43.240]   Yeah, I was going to say.
[00:47:43.240 --> 00:47:44.240]   I was going to say, I have it in the nation.
[00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:45.800]   They're quite the way OJ did.
[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:47.800]   I believe the nation is gripped.
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:49.840]   I mean, definitely people are concerned about it.
[00:47:49.840 --> 00:47:51.480]   I think they're really interested in this.
[00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:56.000]   And by the way, a lot more interesting than following the political situation.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.960]   There's a lot of what's going on in Syria.
[00:47:57.960 --> 00:47:59.960]   There's a lot of stuff that's not as much fun.
[00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:02.880]   I do think this is just massive theater.
[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:07.160]   And that both sides really know that law enforcement gets plenty of information from
[00:48:07.160 --> 00:48:08.360]   all sorts of sources.
[00:48:08.360 --> 00:48:09.360]   Yeah.
[00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:10.360]   They are not going dark.
[00:48:10.360 --> 00:48:11.360]   There was a Harvard Berkman...
[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:12.880]   Prism is still going for this.
[00:48:12.880 --> 00:48:14.800]   Prism is going echelons going.
[00:48:14.800 --> 00:48:17.600]   They know a lot about what's going on.
[00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:20.160]   Furthermore, Apple cooperates with the government quite routinely.
[00:48:20.160 --> 00:48:21.160]   Yeah.
[00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:22.160]   I don't...
[00:48:22.160 --> 00:48:23.160]   They cooperated on this.
[00:48:23.160 --> 00:48:24.160]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:48:24.160 --> 00:48:25.160]   It was like...
[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:26.160]   I think a public with this one.
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:27.160]   Yeah.
[00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:28.160]   And they'll say this out loud.
[00:48:28.160 --> 00:48:29.160]   It's a secret.
[00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:30.160]   Exactly.
[00:48:30.160 --> 00:48:37.120]   But so I think both parties, in some degree, deserve a little approbation.
[00:48:37.120 --> 00:48:38.840]   There was a shame on both your houses.
[00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:39.840]   Shame on both your houses.
[00:48:39.840 --> 00:48:43.160]   But what I have enjoyed a lot about the broader talk of encryption and privacy is that it's
[00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:47.000]   brought out people who don't know anything about security and given a platform to say
[00:48:47.000 --> 00:48:49.440]   very foolish things in public, which has been enjoyable.
[00:48:49.440 --> 00:48:50.680]   It has been funny to watch.
[00:48:50.680 --> 00:48:52.160]   You just feel like, "I want a magic pony."
[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:53.680]   And we're like, "No, you can't have a magic pony."
[00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:54.680]   This does shake out.
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:57.360]   Mama wants the magic pony that doesn't exist.
[00:48:57.360 --> 00:48:58.560]   There's got to be a magic pony.
[00:48:58.560 --> 00:49:02.680]   If the nerds would only nerd a little bit harder, they could make us a magic pony.
[00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:05.160]   That's why Southwest talk was shaming.
[00:49:05.160 --> 00:49:07.320]   It was incredibly incredibly sad.
[00:49:07.320 --> 00:49:09.280]   I can't comment on this a lot.
[00:49:09.280 --> 00:49:11.920]   I can't comment on this case specifically, but here's a theoretical scenario that can
[00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:13.080]   easily apply to this case.
[00:49:13.080 --> 00:49:16.520]   I'm calling your audience fetishists because they don't like privacy.
[00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:18.520]   It's a politician's fetish.
[00:49:18.520 --> 00:49:19.520]   It's a shame.
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:20.520]   It's a shame.
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:24.120]   Because he came to South by Southwest to do a good thing, which is to get the tech community
[00:49:24.120 --> 00:49:27.760]   to support transparent government, efficient government.
[00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:30.920]   And then he gets asked that question and he throws it all away.
[00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:31.920]   Yeah.
[00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:36.960]   But he must have known the question was coming and that must have been the considered response
[00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:37.960]   they had to that.
[00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:38.960]   Who is preparing that?
[00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:39.960]   It's the best they've got.
[00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:40.960]   Exactly.
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:43.240]   This tech team is telling him that they're not doing a good job advising him.
[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:47.600]   Which means that we have a problem from all levels of government on this issue.
[00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:48.600]   Math works.
[00:49:48.600 --> 00:49:49.600]   Yes.
[00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:51.200]   You can't break math so that we have encryption or we don't.
[00:49:51.200 --> 00:49:54.280]   You can't just have this awkward middle ground because someone else told you you could.
[00:49:54.280 --> 00:49:55.280]   Magic ponies don't exist.
[00:49:55.280 --> 00:49:57.040]   Maybe we can look a little deeper.
[00:49:57.040 --> 00:50:01.920]   I think this, I think, and I don't know where, what we're going to find if we dig deeper.
[00:50:01.920 --> 00:50:06.440]   But we've got to assume that all parties in this are intelligent, not the congressman.
[00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:11.680]   But, but, but the law enforcement's intelligent, Apple's intelligent, the president is for
[00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:13.440]   sure intelligent.
[00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:19.000]   I suspect there is a deeper, longer game being played here and I can't quite figure out what
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:20.680]   it is.
[00:50:20.680 --> 00:50:26.560]   But I do feel like it's a, that was a dumb thing for the president to say.
[00:50:26.560 --> 00:50:30.880]   And I think he knows better than to do that unless there's more than meets the eye here.
[00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:32.320]   What is the long game?
[00:50:32.320 --> 00:50:34.440]   What would the government really like?
[00:50:34.440 --> 00:50:37.040]   I think the, here's one thing.
[00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:39.400]   And by the way, I'm going to credit Bruce Sterling.
[00:50:39.400 --> 00:50:41.480]   You've got to listen to his keynote at the end.
[00:50:41.480 --> 00:50:44.400]   He's done it for 30 years now at the end of South by Southwest.
[00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:46.120]   And he is brilliant.
[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:48.800]   And he is a Serbik and he is totally cynical.
[00:50:48.800 --> 00:50:49.960]   But he says, forget it.
[00:50:49.960 --> 00:50:54.000]   The four horsemen of the, the five horsemen of the internet, Microsoft, Apple, Amazon,
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:51:01.360]   Facebook and Google have, are, have created a commercial surveillance society.
[00:51:01.360 --> 00:51:03.520]   They know everything.
[00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:07.760]   Law enforcement has created a law enforcement surveillance society.
[00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:09.060]   They know everything.
[00:51:09.060 --> 00:51:11.080]   There's no dark.
[00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:16.960]   What they would like you to think is there's some dark, but in fact, there isn't.
[00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:22.640]   And so a lot of this, he believes is hand waving from both parties to say, pay no attention
[00:51:22.640 --> 00:51:26.320]   to the real matter at hand, which is we know everything you're doing.
[00:51:26.320 --> 00:51:30.480]   And it's only getting better as you continue to put Internet of Things devices in your
[00:51:30.480 --> 00:51:31.480]   house.
[00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:34.360]   I asked my radio audience today, look around you.
[00:51:34.360 --> 00:51:37.840]   How many microphones and cameras are around you right now?
[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:40.080]   Look here, every one of our computers has a camera.
[00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:41.800]   Every one of our phones has a camera.
[00:51:41.800 --> 00:51:46.400]   They all have microphones, your echo, your television set.
[00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:52.080]   And we're adding more and more all the time, all of which is accessible by bad guys, good
[00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:55.080]   guys and commercial interests.
[00:51:55.080 --> 00:51:58.640]   Adam, I think what they want us to do is just forget about that.
[00:51:58.640 --> 00:52:01.040]   Hey, look, no, we're, we can make your phone private.
[00:52:01.040 --> 00:52:04.520]   They want to have that conversation because they don't want us to think beyond it.
[00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:08.960]   But if you don't have strong encryption, you couldn't even have the theoretical option
[00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:09.960]   of privacy.
[00:52:09.960 --> 00:52:10.960]   Yeah.
[00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:13.680]   And that's why there's highly theoretical that that mile high picket fence.
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:15.760]   Adam, there's a million other ways around.
[00:52:15.760 --> 00:52:16.760]   I still have hope.
[00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:17.760]   Yeah.
[00:52:17.760 --> 00:52:18.760]   I still have hope for privacy.
[00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:24.560]   I still, I, I think that if we as the technology community work on these things, IoT, VR even,
[00:52:24.560 --> 00:52:29.040]   yeah, and we do it properly and we build it correctly and with good walls and defense,
[00:52:29.040 --> 00:52:31.640]   we could still have at least a modicum of privacy.
[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:35.080]   The people who end up protecting their privacy look like cooks.
[00:52:35.080 --> 00:52:37.200]   They've got tape over their cameras.
[00:52:37.200 --> 00:52:40.440]   They carry feature phones, not smartphones.
[00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:44.760]   And they look like their tin hat crazies.
[00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:47.360]   And in fact, that's what you have to do if you want to be private.
[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:48.360]   Well, it's quite extreme.
[00:52:48.360 --> 00:52:49.560]   And we're not going to do that.
[00:52:49.560 --> 00:52:50.560]   Us here.
[00:52:50.560 --> 00:52:51.560]   No, what's going to do that?
[00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:52.560]   No.
[00:52:52.560 --> 00:52:55.240]   But, but again, if we don't have encryption, you can't have that for anybody.
[00:52:55.240 --> 00:52:56.240]   No, exactly.
[00:52:56.240 --> 00:52:58.400]   And so we need to have a cyber-sac reporters that are secure.
[00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:02.960]   But that's kind of the point is that Ted, Ted Kaczynski benefits from encryption.
[00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:03.960]   Nobody else does.
[00:53:03.960 --> 00:53:05.840]   Well, I like to, I like it.
[00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:06.840]   I use it.
[00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:08.240]   But are you, but really come on.
[00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:09.240]   Oh, I'm not very.
[00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:10.240]   I use it casually.
[00:53:10.240 --> 00:53:11.240]   You use it casually.
[00:53:11.240 --> 00:53:14.720]   But look, at the end of the day, if anybody wanted to get onto anyone on well computers,
[00:53:14.720 --> 00:53:15.720]   they could do it.
[00:53:15.720 --> 00:53:16.720]   Easily.
[00:53:16.720 --> 00:53:19.160]   Just by breaking into the house and sorting stuff on there.
[00:53:19.160 --> 00:53:22.840]   Anyway, but you've got to have that baseline.
[00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:27.200]   You can't have them saying you don't have the right to secure communications.
[00:53:27.200 --> 00:53:29.320]   Because once you've given up that battle, that's it.
[00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:33.280]   Everything else is just, I mean, you could argue we've already lost it all anyway, but
[00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:35.320]   I'd like to have a look in there.
[00:53:35.320 --> 00:53:36.320]   I agree.
[00:53:36.320 --> 00:53:39.480]   And this is what law enforcement and commercial interests want you to say.
[00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:40.920]   They say, yes, yes, you have encryption.
[00:53:40.920 --> 00:53:42.160]   We're going to fight over it.
[00:53:42.160 --> 00:53:45.480]   And then you're going to win and you're going to feel good because you have encryption.
[00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:50.000]   Meanwhile, everybody who wants to know what you're up to, which includes commercial interest
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:52.560]   and government interest, knows exactly what you're up to.
[00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:54.840]   Okay, we were having a no attention.
[00:53:54.840 --> 00:53:56.000]   We got encryption though.
[00:53:56.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   We won.
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:00.360]   We will win this battle and we will all go home fat and happy.
[00:54:00.360 --> 00:54:04.600]   And they will be happy because in fact, there was never any chance of us winning.
[00:54:04.600 --> 00:54:07.680]   Leo, I've noticed this before, but that's a little bit too cynical.
[00:54:07.680 --> 00:54:08.680]   I know.
[00:54:08.680 --> 00:54:09.680]   Alex will help.
[00:54:09.680 --> 00:54:10.680]   I know.
[00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:11.680]   I'm so proud of myself right now.
[00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:13.160]   But do you not think that's the case?
[00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:17.080]   I think it's most of the case, but I think if we can win this particular battle, we can
[00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:22.720]   move the way to gravity more towards our direction and the direction of privacy.
[00:54:22.720 --> 00:54:26.200]   I'm at least going to operate under that assumption because I think it still matters.
[00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:29.040]   So if I'm wrong and wrong, but I think it matters.
[00:54:29.040 --> 00:54:30.040]   Okay.
[00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:31.040]   Oh, we're not with this.
[00:54:31.040 --> 00:54:35.400]   I think it matters, but I think that we have lost the ability to choose that long ago
[00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:42.000]   because of Google Amazon Apple Microsoft and Facebook on the one hand NSA, which by the
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:45.920]   way, NSA is now giving its information to domestic law enforcement.
[00:54:45.920 --> 00:54:46.920]   Yeah.
[00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:47.920]   Yeah.
[00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:51.440]   Alex, how can you look at that and say, Oh, yeah, well, there's still hope.
[00:54:51.440 --> 00:54:52.520]   There's no freaking hope.
[00:54:52.520 --> 00:54:53.520]   Are you nuts?
[00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:54.520]   We need to.
[00:54:54.520 --> 00:54:55.520]   I hope I'm not nuts.
[00:54:55.520 --> 00:54:56.520]   That would be terrible.
[00:54:56.520 --> 00:54:57.520]   That would make my life a lot harder.
[00:54:57.520 --> 00:54:59.040]   I feel like I couldn't do my job.
[00:54:59.040 --> 00:55:01.320]   But I mean, the commercial interests are opt in.
[00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:04.760]   I use Gmail, they send ads against my email.
[00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:07.520]   I don't have an ability to opt out of the NSA aside from strong.
[00:55:07.520 --> 00:55:10.880]   When's the last time your internet service provider asked you to opt in or out of privacy?
[00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:13.080]   Well, that's used to work on that right now, actually.
[00:55:13.080 --> 00:55:14.800]   Yeah, but Tom was a great guy.
[00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:16.800]   But yeah, Tom, we lose a great guy.
[00:55:16.800 --> 00:55:17.880]   Okay, right there.
[00:55:17.880 --> 00:55:21.400]   The fact that we are now, and I agree with you saying Tom, we lose a great guy means how
[00:55:21.400 --> 00:55:22.400]   hopeless it is.
[00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:23.400]   All right.
[00:55:23.400 --> 00:55:29.840]   Well, not just because we just, yeah, we should go into the future knowing now or
[00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:31.720]   do I have to wait till I'm going to talk about cameras?
[00:55:31.720 --> 00:55:32.720]   No, I mean, it's.
[00:55:32.720 --> 00:55:37.000]   Yeah, Tom, we don't surprise all of us because the guy was.
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:38.000]   Because we thought he was a.
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:39.760]   Chief lobbyist, Inca, for industry.
[00:55:39.760 --> 00:55:41.480]   He's lobbyists for the telco industry.
[00:55:41.480 --> 00:55:43.480]   And the whole fame in industries.
[00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:49.200]   He then almost, when he published that initial net neutrality thing, he just like, oh yeah,
[00:55:49.200 --> 00:55:50.200]   here we go.
[00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:51.960]   Bend over, it's coming.
[00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:55.120]   And then he was like, actually, no.
[00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:57.720]   And then the industry got a little bit of hope on this.
[00:55:57.720 --> 00:56:01.360]   But with this, with the encryption thing, they're going to carry on pushing and pushing.
[00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:05.440]   Doesn't it puzzle you a little bit sooner or somebody breaks who used to be a lobbyist
[00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:09.920]   for these interests suddenly is on the side of a good or actually no.
[00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:10.920]   Why is it?
[00:56:10.920 --> 00:56:12.520]   Because I spent time with him.
[00:56:12.520 --> 00:56:14.000]   And you think he's genuine?
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:15.800]   I was so shocked by this.
[00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:21.440]   I thought Tom Wheeler was going to be the dingo that you don't think that some star chamber
[00:56:21.440 --> 00:56:27.160]   brought him in and said, Mr. Wheeler, you've been a faithful and loyal servant all these
[00:56:27.160 --> 00:56:28.260]   years.
[00:56:28.260 --> 00:56:31.080]   And we'd like to ask one more favor of you.
[00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:37.000]   Would you pretend to be on the side of net neutrality and privacy and all that is good
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:38.080]   and holy?
[00:56:38.080 --> 00:56:45.840]   Because we'd very much like people to think that the battle is raging here while we put
[00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:53.880]   rooms in the AT&T offices and we put special devices in every ISP to record all your activities
[00:56:53.880 --> 00:56:57.640]   for the next two years while we secretly do all of this stuff.
[00:56:57.640 --> 00:57:00.800]   And everybody's saying, Tom Wheeler, he's fighting for the good.
[00:57:00.800 --> 00:57:02.680]   And he gets, by the way, good for Tom Wheeler.
[00:57:02.680 --> 00:57:07.280]   He's now in the wireless Hall of Fame, the cable Hall of Fame, and the people's Hall of
[00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:08.280]   Fame.
[00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:11.840]   And he'll probably retire with a nice payout.
[00:57:11.840 --> 00:57:16.680]   But really is what he's doing and what the FCC is doing, changing this in a one way.
[00:57:16.680 --> 00:57:19.720]   I don't want to conflate what the FCC does and what the NSA does.
[00:57:19.720 --> 00:57:21.960]   I mean, those are two very, very different things.
[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:24.680]   Tom Wheeler's arguing about why he made the choices he did with net neutrality was that
[00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:27.360]   his customer is now the American public.
[00:57:27.360 --> 00:57:28.360]   Right?
[00:57:28.360 --> 00:57:29.360]   So he's going to operate as a factory.
[00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:31.120]   He works for a customer, whoever that might be.
[00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:32.440]   Well, that sounds very commercial.
[00:57:32.440 --> 00:57:35.480]   But I think he's actually a very moral person because he took a withering fire from his
[00:57:35.480 --> 00:57:37.680]   former allies and lawyers for those.
[00:57:37.680 --> 00:57:38.680]   I know.
[00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:42.120]   And the best part was, again, Congress got involved and held a number of ridiculous hearings.
[00:57:42.120 --> 00:57:44.840]   It got whacked around by Tom Wheeler, which I really enjoyed watching.
[00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:45.840]   Yes.
[00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:47.560]   But on the NSA site, it's a separate thing.
[00:57:47.560 --> 00:57:50.400]   I'm not mad at the NSA because of Tom Wheeler or vice versa.
[00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:53.920]   They're very, very different entities and responsibilities.
[00:57:53.920 --> 00:57:57.160]   I don't know when I became this conspiracy at all.
[00:57:57.160 --> 00:57:58.160]   1947.
[00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:00.240]   No, I'm not that guy.
[00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:01.240]   I'm the optimist.
[00:58:01.240 --> 00:58:04.760]   But I'm starting to have, well, listen to Bruce Sterling and you tell me how you feel.
[00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:05.760]   Oh, no.
[00:58:05.760 --> 00:58:10.280]   But I mean, seriously, I've been, you got a black hat and before Snowden, if you suggested
[00:58:10.280 --> 00:58:14.040]   some of the things the government might be doing to government spokespeople, they would
[00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:15.760]   just pull you out to your face.
[00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:18.200]   The irony is we really knew all of that was happening.
[00:58:18.200 --> 00:58:20.200]   We were just kind of putting our noses about it.
[00:58:20.200 --> 00:58:21.200]   Yeah.
[00:58:21.200 --> 00:58:23.160]   We were pretending to do it, but nobody had the proof.
[00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:24.160]   Yeah.
[00:58:24.160 --> 00:58:25.160]   And you got our proof to us.
[00:58:25.160 --> 00:58:26.160]   Because we didn't have proof.
[00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:28.760]   We were heading to the sand and say, oh, no, it can't be happening.
[00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:29.760]   Yeah.
[00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:32.720]   And then, and then unfortunately, Snowden really ruined it.
[00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:35.800]   He said, take your hands off yours because I got something to tell you.
[00:58:35.800 --> 00:58:36.800]   Yeah.
[00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:40.720]   If you're watching this, do a Google search for room 641A.
[00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:41.720]   It's still there, right?
[00:58:41.720 --> 00:58:42.720]   I believe such.
[00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:43.720]   Look at it.
[00:58:43.720 --> 00:58:44.720]   Yeah.
[00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:45.720]   Yeah.
[00:58:45.720 --> 00:58:46.720]   Oh, yeah.
[00:58:46.720 --> 00:58:47.720]   Somebody said it's not been there in 20 years.
[00:58:47.720 --> 00:58:48.720]   Oh, no.
[00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:49.720]   Oh, no.
[00:58:49.720 --> 00:58:50.720]   Little did you know.
[00:58:50.720 --> 00:58:51.720]   Don't kid yourself.
[00:58:51.720 --> 00:58:54.080]   Great, great conversation.
[00:58:54.080 --> 00:58:55.080]   Thank you.
[00:58:55.080 --> 00:58:58.320]   I'm sure you will, Helm, from-- I don't know where the hell is from.
[00:58:58.320 --> 00:58:59.320]   Matter of what.com.
[00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:00.320]   Matter of what?
[00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:01.720]   It's a great place.
[00:59:01.720 --> 00:59:06.480]   Actually, now you really cover investments in investors and money and--
[00:59:06.480 --> 00:59:07.480]   Startups, not sort of stuff.
[00:59:07.480 --> 00:59:08.480]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:59:08.480 --> 00:59:09.480]   It's great.
[00:59:09.480 --> 00:59:10.480]   But I still care a lot about politics and privacy.
[00:59:10.480 --> 00:59:11.480]   Which is why you're here.
[00:59:11.480 --> 00:59:12.480]   It's why I'm here.
[00:59:12.480 --> 00:59:14.080]   Oh, this is a great panel.
[00:59:14.080 --> 00:59:15.720]   The millennials on this half.
[00:59:15.720 --> 00:59:16.720]   Yes.
[00:59:16.720 --> 00:59:20.880]   By the way, anybody have a funeral you'd like to go to?
[00:59:20.880 --> 00:59:21.880]   No.
[00:59:21.880 --> 00:59:24.280]   It's been a busy first three months of the year.
[00:59:24.280 --> 00:59:26.960]   I'll go to say, I never thought Lemmy was going to go.
[00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:28.360]   Oh, that's so sad.
[00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:30.680]   I sold farts that really had to put up with a lot, haven't we?
[00:59:30.680 --> 00:59:31.680]   Yeah.
[00:59:31.680 --> 00:59:32.680]   That's Ian Thompson.
[00:59:32.680 --> 00:59:35.000]   I just never thought Lemmy was going to go.
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:36.640]   Ian Thompson, the Register Steve,
[00:59:36.640 --> 00:59:38.600]   Kovec from techinsider.io.
[00:59:38.600 --> 00:59:39.600]   More to come.
[00:59:39.600 --> 00:59:40.600]   Lots more to come.
[00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:45.640]   But first, I want to talk about go to meeting the powerfully simple way to meet with your coworkers

[01:01:03.840 --> 01:01:06.240]   Wow.
[01:01:06.240 --> 01:01:09.120]   This is interesting.
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:10.120]   Intense.
[01:01:10.120 --> 01:01:13.280]   Who thought that I would be the cynic and you would be the pie-eyed optimist?
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:14.800]   It does feel kind of strange.
[01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:15.800]   I never expected that.
[01:01:15.800 --> 01:01:16.800]   Someone else's skin walked out backwards.
[01:01:16.800 --> 01:01:21.360]   I never expected that.
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:23.040]   Do you guys have an echo?
[01:01:23.040 --> 01:01:24.040]   I do not.
[01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:25.040]   Not anymore.
[01:01:25.040 --> 01:01:26.040]   I have to give them one back.
[01:01:26.040 --> 01:01:27.040]   I need to buy one.
[01:01:27.040 --> 01:01:28.040]   You're going to buy a dot maybe?
[01:01:28.040 --> 01:01:31.400]   I don't know because I bought a sonos only because it had Spotify.
[01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:32.400]   I know.
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:36.480]   And at the time, echo had Spotify and then echo got Spotify and I was kicking myself.
[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:38.280]   You see that dot you could hook up to your stereo.
[01:01:38.280 --> 01:01:41.320]   It was a problem with a sonos because the speaker's not so good.
[01:01:41.320 --> 01:01:42.480]   I worry about sonos.
[01:01:42.480 --> 01:01:43.480]   I think that...
[01:01:43.480 --> 01:01:44.880]   Well, they're going through a big shift now.
[01:01:44.880 --> 01:01:45.880]   They're firing people.
[01:01:45.880 --> 01:01:49.280]   And they say they're going to add voice, but they can put Alexa inside sonos.
[01:01:49.280 --> 01:01:50.920]   There's nothing stopping them from doing that.
[01:01:50.920 --> 01:01:52.480]   I think Amazon should just buy them.
[01:01:52.480 --> 01:01:53.480]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:01:53.480 --> 01:01:55.560]   That would be very interesting.
[01:01:55.560 --> 01:01:57.520]   There must be a play with the financial...
[01:01:57.520 --> 01:02:00.680]   Yeah, aside from the Kendall Amazon's hardware projects, I've always done...
[01:02:00.680 --> 01:02:03.560]   Well, that's why you bring in the guys from Santa Barbara to do this thing.
[01:02:03.560 --> 01:02:04.560]   Okay.
[01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:05.560]   I can see that.
[01:02:05.560 --> 01:02:06.560]   How much money would you pay for it?
[01:02:06.560 --> 01:02:07.560]   Not much.
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:08.560]   They have pretty high revenues.
[01:02:08.560 --> 01:02:09.560]   Do they?
[01:02:09.560 --> 01:02:10.560]   Yeah.
[01:02:10.560 --> 01:02:11.560]   Where are they laying people off?
[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:12.560]   They're not.
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:13.560]   They're refocusing.
[01:02:13.560 --> 01:02:14.560]   It's not really...
[01:02:14.560 --> 01:02:15.560]   I don't know.
[01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:16.560]   You're bothering them.
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:17.560]   Yeah.
[01:02:17.560 --> 01:02:18.560]   I did buy that.
[01:02:18.560 --> 01:02:19.560]   Because not firing people were revocusing.
[01:02:19.560 --> 01:02:22.000]   Look, look at the history of sonos.
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:27.800]   They were so far ahead, they made a big bet 12 or 13 years ago and one, that streaming
[01:02:27.800 --> 01:02:29.200]   audio was going to be a thing.
[01:02:29.200 --> 01:02:33.480]   We probably thought their idiots were soliciting a CD's back.
[01:02:33.480 --> 01:02:34.480]   They were totally right.
[01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:36.400]   Now they're going all in on streaming.
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:39.040]   They're saying, "Yeah, share your library stuff.
[01:02:39.040 --> 01:02:40.040]   That's not really a big thing."
[01:02:40.040 --> 01:02:41.040]   Whatever.
[01:02:41.040 --> 01:02:44.240]   But now they realize, "Whoa, there's this burgeoning trend of the Alexa's and the smart
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:45.960]   assistants in the home."
[01:02:45.960 --> 01:02:50.600]   They don't have anything there and they realize, "We need to double down, refocus, move people
[01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:55.360]   around where we need to move them and get into the space because it's the next big thing."
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:03:00.320]   I bet next year we start seeing sonos with Alexa built in or something very similar.
[01:03:00.320 --> 01:03:01.320]   Okay.
[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:02.320]   Now the Leo...
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:03.320]   That's my positive side.
[01:03:03.320 --> 01:03:06.360]   Leo has put me on the old font side of the table.
[01:03:06.360 --> 01:03:08.120]   I've got to ask.
[01:03:08.120 --> 01:03:13.000]   I know people who tried Echo's, I know people who tried a bunch of these different devices.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:18.040]   Is it really that good that you're willing to have that amount, an expensive bit of hardware
[01:03:18.040 --> 01:03:23.080]   always listening in your house that you wouldn't rather just go to a laptop and press play?
[01:03:23.080 --> 01:03:24.080]   Yeah.
[01:03:24.080 --> 01:03:29.160]   It's really cool to come home and say, "Alexa, play me some Weezer or a Alexa, I mean some."
[01:03:29.160 --> 01:03:32.560]   You know, it's a better battle than that.
[01:03:32.560 --> 01:03:34.080]   Alexa, play some Nickelback.
[01:03:34.080 --> 01:03:35.080]   Yeah.
[01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:36.080]   It's really cool.
[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:38.960]   Oh, by the way, we've now started a Weezer stream in half of our audience.
[01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:40.200]   The other half's listening to Nickelback.
[01:03:40.200 --> 01:03:41.200]   Yeah.
[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:42.200]   There we go.
[01:03:42.200 --> 01:03:43.200]   I don't think.
[01:03:43.200 --> 01:03:44.200]   That's mean.
[01:03:44.200 --> 01:03:45.200]   But if you...
[01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:47.880]   No, and there's other things, because you can say Alexa is at a timer.
[01:03:47.880 --> 01:03:49.040]   I'm sorry, I keep saying Alexa.
[01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:50.040]   Echo said a timer.
[01:03:50.040 --> 01:03:51.040]   Two finger strokes.
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:52.040]   It's really...
[01:03:52.040 --> 01:03:54.680]   No, no, you said you are sounding like an old fart now.
[01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:55.680]   Yeah.
[01:03:55.680 --> 01:03:56.680]   I'm actually on his team.
[01:03:56.680 --> 01:03:57.680]   Should we change chairs?
[01:03:57.680 --> 01:03:58.680]   You've always been an old fart.
[01:03:58.680 --> 01:03:59.680]   But we need to try it.
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:00.880]   You don't get it until you try it.
[01:04:00.880 --> 01:04:01.880]   I said this.
[01:04:01.880 --> 01:04:05.000]   I was on 10 years tonight the other night and I said the exact same thing.
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:08.120]   But when I got rid of mine to send it back to my review and back, I missed it.
[01:04:08.120 --> 01:04:09.120]   You missed it.
[01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:10.120]   You missed her.
[01:04:10.120 --> 01:04:15.400]   You missed strange to come home and not start playing music and say, "Do this for me."
[01:04:15.400 --> 01:04:16.400]   It was interesting.
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:17.400]   It was like a lost...
[01:04:17.400 --> 01:04:19.280]   See, I love Guzewa's voice search.
[01:04:19.280 --> 01:04:22.080]   I think that's a great application.
[01:04:22.080 --> 01:04:27.400]   But the idea of just having this hard way in my house, constantly listening to conversations
[01:04:27.400 --> 01:04:28.400]   around the house.
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:31.280]   I've got a bad sense of humor in some respects.
[01:04:31.280 --> 01:04:32.280]   So it's things I don't want to...
[01:04:32.280 --> 01:04:33.680]   Don't tell you bad jokes, by the way.
[01:04:33.680 --> 01:04:34.680]   Yeah.
[01:04:34.680 --> 01:04:35.680]   Yeah.
[01:04:35.680 --> 01:04:36.680]   Let me guess.
[01:04:36.680 --> 01:04:37.680]   Echo, tell me a joke.
[01:04:37.680 --> 01:04:38.680]   It'll tell you a joke.
[01:04:38.680 --> 01:04:39.680]   Here's a bad joke.
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:42.760]   You could say Echo, tell me an Obama joke.
[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:43.760]   Tell me a Clinton joke.
[01:04:43.760 --> 01:04:44.760]   They have all these...
[01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:50.080]   What's interesting is it's very easy to write additional skills for the Amazon.
[01:04:50.080 --> 01:04:53.240]   So they're exploding.
[01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:56.920]   And that's one of the problems actually they're having is there's so many skills.
[01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:59.040]   It's hard to keep track of all the things it can do.
[01:04:59.040 --> 01:05:01.680]   Well, I mean, when Siri came out, we all found the Easter eggs in Siri.
[01:05:01.680 --> 01:05:02.680]   It was a lot of fun.
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:03.680]   They tell me a joke.
[01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:04.680]   Well, you do.
[01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:05.680]   Yeah.
[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:06.680]   Do you love me?
[01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:08.600]   And that was fun for about a weekend.
[01:05:08.600 --> 01:05:12.040]   And then I haven't found a new one yet because I don't use Siri because it doesn't work.
[01:05:12.040 --> 01:05:14.400]   And so I'm skeptical of this.
[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:17.160]   So it's funny is it's not as good as...
[01:05:17.160 --> 01:05:20.760]   Be honest, it's not as good as Google or Siri, but it's your house listening.
[01:05:20.760 --> 01:05:21.760]   Interesting.
[01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:26.320]   And that's sort of a cultural difference that I think is a very big difference.
[01:05:26.320 --> 01:05:29.320]   You're not talking into something or manipulating something.
[01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:33.760]   You're just standing there doing what you're doing and you say to your house how much gas
[01:05:33.760 --> 01:05:38.560]   is in the car and it tells you it's very passive and it's easier than looking at
[01:05:38.560 --> 01:05:39.560]   a screen.
[01:05:39.560 --> 01:05:43.560]   It's an ambeant, intelligent player, domicile.
[01:05:43.560 --> 01:05:49.160]   Well, and it's a dumb intelligence layer, but I can see the day when it's Scarlett Johansson's
[01:05:49.160 --> 01:05:55.560]   voice and it's more interactive and it does more and it's just the beginning again of
[01:05:55.560 --> 01:05:56.560]   something pretty amazing.
[01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:59.160]   Is this the start of a house OS, if you will?
[01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:00.160]   Yeah.
[01:06:00.160 --> 01:06:01.160]   Yeah.
[01:06:01.160 --> 01:06:02.160]   Oh, definitely.
[01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:03.160]   Now I understand better what we're talking about.
[01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:04.160]   Okay, cool.
[01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:05.160]   That's exactly.
[01:06:05.160 --> 01:06:06.160]   And we were talking about this before when I was on Twitter.
[01:06:06.160 --> 01:06:07.160]   A couple days ago.
[01:06:07.160 --> 01:06:08.880]   It's going to be the end game for Amazon.
[01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:10.480]   They screwed up with the fire phone.
[01:06:10.480 --> 01:06:12.800]   It was a total flock in miss smartphones.
[01:06:12.800 --> 01:06:16.960]   So they're like, we need to find a platform that we can just dominate and they stumbled
[01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:17.960]   on this and it's super interesting.
[01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:19.920]   Oh, by the way, it helps you buy stuff on Amazon.
[01:06:19.920 --> 01:06:20.920]   Yeah, really, really good.
[01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:21.920]   But you don't have to use it.
[01:06:21.920 --> 01:06:22.920]   You don't have to use it.
[01:06:22.920 --> 01:06:23.920]   What happens to those little buttons?
[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:24.920]   The dash buttons?
[01:06:24.920 --> 01:06:25.920]   Yeah, they're still around.
[01:06:25.920 --> 01:06:26.920]   Yeah, they're still there.
[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:27.920]   So they're building like.
[01:06:27.920 --> 01:06:28.920]   But it's better than a dash button.
[01:06:28.920 --> 01:06:31.280]   So I could have a dash button to buy toilet paper, which I do.
[01:06:31.280 --> 01:06:35.800]   Or I can say Echo buy some more toilet paper and I say, oh, you last bought 12 pack of
[01:06:35.800 --> 01:06:36.800]   toilet paper.
[01:06:36.800 --> 01:06:37.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:06:37.800 --> 01:06:38.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:06:38.800 --> 01:06:39.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:40.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:06:40.800 --> 01:06:41.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:06:41.800 --> 01:06:42.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:06:42.800 --> 01:06:43.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:44.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:06:44.800 --> 01:06:45.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:06:45.800 --> 01:06:46.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:06:46.800 --> 01:06:47.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:06:47.800 --> 01:06:48.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:49.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:06:49.800 --> 01:06:50.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:06:50.800 --> 01:06:51.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:06:51.800 --> 01:06:52.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:06:52.800 --> 01:06:53.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:06:53.800 --> 01:06:54.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:55.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:06:55.800 --> 01:06:56.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:06:56.800 --> 01:06:57.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:06:57.800 --> 01:06:58.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:06:58.800 --> 01:06:59.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:00.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:01.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:02.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:07:02.800 --> 01:07:03.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:04.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:05.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:07:05.800 --> 01:07:06.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:07:06.800 --> 01:07:07.800]   I'm not sure.

[01:46:12.800 --> 01:46:13.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:13.800 --> 01:46:14.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:14.800 --> 01:46:15.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:15.800 --> 01:46:16.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:16.800 --> 01:46:17.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:17.800 --> 01:46:18.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:18.800 --> 01:46:19.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:19.800 --> 01:46:20.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:20.800 --> 01:46:21.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:21.800 --> 01:46:22.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:22.800 --> 01:46:23.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:23.800 --> 01:46:24.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:24.800 --> 01:46:25.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:25.800 --> 01:46:26.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:27.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:27.800 --> 01:46:28.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:28.800 --> 01:46:29.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:29.800 --> 01:46:30.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:30.800 --> 01:46:31.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:31.800 --> 01:46:32.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:32.800 --> 01:46:33.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:33.800 --> 01:46:34.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:34.800 --> 01:46:35.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:35.800 --> 01:46:36.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:37.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:37.800 --> 01:46:38.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:38.800 --> 01:46:39.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:40.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:40.800 --> 01:46:41.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:41.800 --> 01:46:42.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:42.800 --> 01:46:43.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:43.800 --> 01:46:44.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:44.800 --> 01:46:45.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:45.800 --> 01:46:46.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:46.800 --> 01:46:47.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:47.800 --> 01:46:48.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:48.800 --> 01:46:49.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:49.800 --> 01:46:50.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:50.800 --> 01:46:51.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:51.800 --> 01:46:52.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:52.800 --> 01:46:53.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:53.800 --> 01:46:54.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:54.800 --> 01:46:55.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:55.800 --> 01:46:56.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:56.800 --> 01:46:57.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:57.800 --> 01:46:58.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:58.800 --> 01:46:59.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:46:59.800 --> 01:47:00.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:47:00.800 --> 01:47:01.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:47:01.800 --> 01:47:02.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:47:02.800 --> 01:47:03.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:04.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:47:04.800 --> 01:47:05.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:47:05.800 --> 01:47:06.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:47:06.800 --> 01:47:07.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:47:07.800 --> 01:47:08.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:47:08.800 --> 01:47:09.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:47:09.800 --> 01:47:10.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:47:10.800 --> 01:47:11.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:47:11.800 --> 01:47:12.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:13.800]   I'm not sure.
[01:47:13.800 --> 01:47:16.800]   I trust some of these larger media companies to actually do a good job by the readers.
[01:47:16.800 --> 01:47:18.800]   I think it's more than somebody.
[01:47:18.800 --> 01:47:20.800]   Here's something which looks like an article we've written.
[01:47:20.800 --> 01:47:25.800]   If you look very closely at the bottom, it says sponsored by XYZ company.
[01:47:25.800 --> 01:47:28.800]   The Atlantic's got a division now doing this.
[01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:29.800]   Yeah.
[01:47:29.800 --> 01:47:30.800]   All the big media companies.
[01:47:30.800 --> 01:47:31.800]   Yeah.
[01:47:31.800 --> 01:47:32.800]   The Atlantic's doing a good job, I thought.
[01:47:32.800 --> 01:47:35.800]   Didn't they do the article on Scientology?
[01:47:35.800 --> 01:47:36.800]   Yes.
[01:47:36.800 --> 01:47:37.800]   That was a few years ago.
[01:47:37.800 --> 01:47:38.800]   Yeah.
[01:47:38.800 --> 01:47:39.800]   Do you recall this, though?
[01:47:39.800 --> 01:47:40.800]   Yeah.
[01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:44.800]   They did lose some good people like Kevin Russe to Fusion.
[01:47:44.800 --> 01:48:03.760]   But I think the Atlantic, Alexis Madrigal, but I think the Atlantic has really, to me, my mind
[01:48:03.760 --> 01:48:05.440]   still is very relevant.
[01:48:05.440 --> 01:48:07.040]   I read a lot of its digital content.
[01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:08.480]   They don't make any money off of me.
[01:48:08.480 --> 01:48:10.080]   I just read their print edition recently.
[01:48:10.080 --> 01:48:11.080]   Yeah.
[01:48:11.080 --> 01:48:12.080]   It's still around, are you?
[01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:15.080]   No, no, I just actually bought the magazine in the airport and then read it.
[01:48:15.080 --> 01:48:16.880]   How was that for you?
[01:48:16.880 --> 01:48:17.880]   I always do that.
[01:48:17.880 --> 01:48:18.880]   What?
[01:48:18.880 --> 01:48:21.080]   No, I'm subscribed to the New York, the paper edition.
[01:48:21.080 --> 01:48:22.080]   Yeah.
[01:48:22.080 --> 01:48:25.080]   I still read the New York, but I'm not, but I got to do it digital.
[01:48:25.080 --> 01:48:26.080]   I can't.
[01:48:26.080 --> 01:48:28.080]   No, I don't know.
[01:48:28.080 --> 01:48:32.080]   It's, don't you feel guilty if there's this pile of New Yorkers you haven't read?
[01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:34.080]   It makes you look smart when people come over there.
[01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:36.080]   They can see that pile throughout a residence.
[01:48:36.080 --> 01:48:39.080]   No, basically, I read them, we read them, we recycle them.
[01:48:39.080 --> 01:48:40.080]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:48:40.080 --> 01:48:41.080]   It's sweet.
[01:48:41.080 --> 01:48:44.080]   Speaking of high culture, Hulk Hogan.
[01:48:44.080 --> 01:48:45.080]   Oh, yeah.
[01:48:45.080 --> 01:48:46.080]   Did we mention that?
[01:48:46.080 --> 01:48:47.080]   Yeah.
[01:48:47.080 --> 01:48:48.080]   We almost got away.
[01:48:48.080 --> 01:48:49.080]   Bang.
[01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:50.080]   Bang.
[01:48:50.080 --> 01:48:51.080]   That's all.
[01:48:51.080 --> 01:48:53.080]   I'm going to say Hulk Hogan.
[01:48:53.080 --> 01:48:57.720]   So, I want, but no, you know, I'm going to put you guys on the spot here because, so, Nick
[01:48:57.720 --> 01:49:06.160]   Denton, who runs Gawker, and Gawker has some titles that are quite respectable, Gizmodo,
[01:49:06.160 --> 01:49:08.720]   Jalopnik, Jezebel.
[01:49:08.720 --> 01:49:09.720]   Jezebel, Jezebel, Desperately.
[01:49:09.720 --> 01:49:10.720]   Desperately.
[01:49:10.720 --> 01:49:11.720]   I love Dead Space.
[01:49:11.720 --> 01:49:12.720]   Dead Spin.
[01:49:12.720 --> 01:49:14.720]   And Gizmodo.
[01:49:14.720 --> 01:49:20.280]   But they also have Gawker, and for a little while they had ValleyWag gossip rags.
[01:49:20.280 --> 01:49:23.040]   Well, ValleyWag's been up and down at the Assyrian Empire.
[01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:24.680]   One day it was in, and it was out.
[01:49:24.680 --> 01:49:27.920]   Yeah, but when they killed ValleyWag, they just rolled all the content in a Gawker, so
[01:49:27.920 --> 01:49:28.920]   it didn't really change anything.
[01:49:28.920 --> 01:49:32.560]   Well, back when Natasha and Sam Biddle was a very active publication, now it's an educational
[01:49:32.560 --> 01:49:34.560]   pot shot from Biddle, that's what it doesn't like.
[01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:35.560]   Yeah.
[01:49:35.560 --> 01:49:36.560]   It actually breaks some stories.
[01:49:36.560 --> 01:49:37.560]   Yeah.
[01:49:37.560 --> 01:49:38.560]   It was day.
[01:49:38.560 --> 01:49:42.240]   You had to read about yourself in a very negative light, which I enjoyed.
[01:49:42.240 --> 01:49:43.240]   So yeah.
[01:49:43.240 --> 01:49:46.560]   Hulk Hogan had a sex tape, I guess.
[01:49:46.560 --> 01:49:49.400]   Bubba the Love Sponge, which recorded it.
[01:49:49.400 --> 01:49:51.560]   How did Willie Best Burrows not write this?
[01:49:51.560 --> 01:49:53.280]   Love of the Love Sponge.
[01:49:53.280 --> 01:49:54.840]   She was a shock jock.
[01:49:54.840 --> 01:49:58.200]   I guess Hulk was having an affair with Bubba's wife.
[01:49:58.200 --> 01:49:59.760]   Well, Missy the Love Sponge.
[01:49:59.760 --> 01:50:01.400]   But it was all coordinated.
[01:50:01.400 --> 01:50:02.400]   Yeah.
[01:50:02.400 --> 01:50:03.400]   Was he?
[01:50:03.400 --> 01:50:04.400]   To the video.
[01:50:04.400 --> 01:50:05.400]   Bubba took the video of this guy.
[01:50:05.400 --> 01:50:06.400]   Yeah.
[01:50:06.400 --> 01:50:07.400]   So he was there.
[01:50:07.400 --> 01:50:09.000]   So he didn't get any cam in there.
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:11.840]   And then tried to mock it around various publications.
[01:50:11.840 --> 01:50:15.320]   And the gopher didn't hesitate to buy it and run it.
[01:50:15.320 --> 01:50:16.320]   Yeah.
[01:50:16.320 --> 01:50:20.880]   Now, Hulk Hogan is a public figure.
[01:50:20.880 --> 01:50:24.640]   And traditionally, if you're a public figure, is it, is anything, what is the, what is the
[01:50:24.640 --> 01:50:25.640]   one?
[01:50:25.640 --> 01:50:26.640]   Yeah.
[01:50:26.640 --> 01:50:27.640]   Has to be true.
[01:50:27.640 --> 01:50:28.640]   That's the number one thing.
[01:50:28.640 --> 01:50:29.640]   Well, it's a tape.
[01:50:29.640 --> 01:50:30.640]   It's obviously not a lie.
[01:50:30.640 --> 01:50:31.640]   So the number one barrier you have to cross is it true.
[01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:34.160]   So libel means that you have to say something untrue within 10.
[01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:35.160]   In 10.
[01:50:35.160 --> 01:50:36.160]   Correct.
[01:50:36.160 --> 01:50:37.160]   So it's not libel.
[01:50:37.160 --> 01:50:40.640]   There was intent, but intent to, you know, get some hits.
[01:50:40.640 --> 01:50:42.800]   But but it was not untrue.
[01:50:42.800 --> 01:50:43.800]   It's a volum.
[01:50:43.800 --> 01:50:47.080]   Anything go like in this case.
[01:50:47.080 --> 01:50:50.480]   No, but for me, but now by the way, no love lost for me.
[01:50:50.480 --> 01:50:55.520]   Gawker is twice not once but twice written really scurrilous stuff about me that I would
[01:50:55.520 --> 01:50:58.200]   sue them over if I weren't smarter than Hulk Hogan.
[01:50:58.200 --> 01:51:01.400]   And I think they've gotten all the way if he gets out of $15 million.
[01:51:01.400 --> 01:51:02.400]   Right.
[01:51:02.400 --> 01:51:03.400]   Who's that?
[01:51:03.400 --> 01:51:04.400]   He won't see a penny.
[01:51:04.400 --> 01:51:05.400]   I don't think we'll see.
[01:51:05.400 --> 01:51:06.400]   No, we'll see.
[01:51:06.400 --> 01:51:07.880]   Depends on your definition of public figure.
[01:51:07.880 --> 01:51:08.880]   Are you a public figure?
[01:51:08.880 --> 01:51:09.880]   I know.
[01:51:09.880 --> 01:51:11.880]   Sam Biddle thinks so.
[01:51:11.880 --> 01:51:12.880]   I think you are.
[01:51:12.880 --> 01:51:13.880]   Yeah, I know.
[01:51:13.880 --> 01:51:14.880]   I mean, I think I am.
[01:51:14.880 --> 01:51:17.720]   And so as a result, as the CFO of Condé Nast.
[01:51:17.720 --> 01:51:18.920]   Now that was out in college.
[01:51:18.920 --> 01:51:20.360]   Now, yeah, that was that was.
[01:51:20.360 --> 01:51:22.040]   Yeah, that's a lawsuit they should have.
[01:51:22.040 --> 01:51:27.280]   You see, I think this comes down to what the the you can be a public figure.
[01:51:27.280 --> 01:51:32.600]   And that gives you maybe slightly less rights to privacy, but absolutely no rights to hypocrisy.
[01:51:32.600 --> 01:51:36.080]   Now, if Hulk Hogan had been going out and campaigning for a traditional marriage and
[01:51:36.080 --> 01:51:39.320]   for divorcees to be stoned in the streets, this would be wide open.
[01:51:39.320 --> 01:51:40.320]   No, I don't think so.
[01:51:40.320 --> 01:51:42.160]   You guys never made a big thing about his sex life.
[01:51:42.160 --> 01:51:44.440]   So why should the fact he's knocking off his best friend's wife?
[01:51:44.440 --> 01:51:46.320]   No, he didn't make a big fact about it.
[01:51:46.320 --> 01:51:47.320]   He did.
[01:51:47.320 --> 01:51:48.320]   Yeah, he was bragging about it.
[01:51:48.320 --> 01:51:50.640]   Hulk Hogan, the fact that he didn't circulate the video.
[01:51:50.640 --> 01:51:52.840]   He didn't circulate the video, but he talked about the fact that he didn't.
[01:51:52.840 --> 01:51:55.080]   So Gawker wanted this law in public to TMZ.
[01:51:55.080 --> 01:51:56.080]   Yeah.
[01:51:56.080 --> 01:51:57.080]   Oh, in that case.
