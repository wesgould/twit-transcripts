[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.200]   The stories of the week analyzed by precisely analyzed
[00:01:31.200 --> 00:01:34.400]   by talented engineers in the land of information
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:35.880]   starting with this guy right here.
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.160]   The scammer himself, scam school, and of course,
[00:01:39.160 --> 00:01:42.000]   the great NSF at W show, Mr. Brian Brushworth.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.280]   I was convinced you're going to say with all the finest minds
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.080]   and this guy.
[00:01:45.080 --> 00:01:46.440]   And this guy.
[00:01:46.440 --> 00:01:49.120]   He is no, your official math mind will later on there will
[00:01:49.120 --> 00:01:49.720]   be math.
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:50.880]   This is going to be a bad scene.
[00:01:50.880 --> 00:01:52.840]   You will be challenged.
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:54.200]   So stand by, Brian Brushworth.
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:01:54.840]   I'm done.
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:57.480]   I'm waiting.
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:01:59.480]   I should say right up front, this is going to be a crappy show
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:01.880]   because both Brian and I have spent the entire week playing
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:02.920]   in Google+.
[00:02:02.920 --> 00:02:04.160]   We weren't doing any of our homework.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.080]   Well, it depends on how you look at it.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:08.640]   It could be we were researching our primary story.
[00:02:08.640 --> 00:02:09.440]   The entire week.
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:10.520]   That was the big story.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:11.520]   We'll talk about it in a second.
[00:02:11.520 --> 00:02:11.960]   Absolutely.
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:13.840]   We've got some experts here, including
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:16.960]   Neillai Patel of this is my next formerly of Engadgets.
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:18.360]   Great to have you, Neillai.
[00:02:18.360 --> 00:02:19.200]   It's great to be back.
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:20.040]   I was loving on the show.
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:22.680]   He is a in a former life an attorney.
[00:02:22.680 --> 00:02:25.360]   So if you have any legal questions, just go ahead and ask.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:26.720]   Yeah, ask somebody else.
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:28.640]   He's an attorney.
[00:02:28.640 --> 00:02:29.720]   That's what he should do.
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:31.120]   There is the guy to watch.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.000]   Well, that's a former lawyer's answer if I've ever heard one.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.360]   I'll still bill you.
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.400]   That's odd.
[00:02:36.400 --> 00:02:38.640]   I'll still bill you.
[00:02:38.640 --> 00:02:40.960]   Hey, here's a guy who hasn't been on the show in ages.
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:43.040]   Of course, he's irregular on many other shows on the Twit
[00:02:43.040 --> 00:02:43.400]   Network.
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:46.920]   We love to have him on scottjohnson of frogpants.com.
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:47.360]   Hey, Scott.
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:48.680]   Hey, it's great to be back.
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.560]   Leo, thanks for having me.
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:51.600]   I spent the week in a mountain cabin
[00:02:51.600 --> 00:02:54.360]   on the equivalent of dial up connection using Google Plus.
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:55.680]   So I don't know what that means,
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:58.080]   but I feel like I'm bringing something of an old school
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:02:59.320]   taste to the table tonight.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.960]   Did you get any quality experience at all?
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:02.520]   I kind of did.
[00:03:02.520 --> 00:03:03.200]   It was just slow.
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:03.720]   It was all right.
[00:03:03.720 --> 00:03:04.720]   I couldn't do any hangouts.
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:05.120]   It couldn't do any--
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.920]   Staying outs were extraordinarily slow.
[00:03:06.920 --> 00:03:09.000]   It was like, hey.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:09.520]   That was really--
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:11.000]   I'm camping right now.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:11.760]   No, don't do that.
[00:03:11.760 --> 00:03:13.720]   That's bad.
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:16.600]   You have a campfire to hang out with.
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:17.760]   Absolutely.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:19.280]   I'd get in, see what was going on.
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.640]   All the cool kids were having fun.
[00:03:20.640 --> 00:03:22.560]   I had to get in, but man, it was slow.
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.600]   It was like 1993 all over again.
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.160]   I love it.
[00:03:26.160 --> 00:03:27.320]   That's why you go there.
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:29.600]   We did bring in an expert, a ringer, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:31.040]   from searchengineland.com.
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:32.480]   Danny Sullivan is here.
[00:03:32.480 --> 00:03:34.800]   And he, quite legitimately, although I noticed in one
[00:03:34.800 --> 00:03:36.680]   of your posts on Google Plus, you said,
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:39.440]   I don't feel like I'm playing hooky.
[00:03:39.440 --> 00:03:42.400]   He spent a lot of time on Google Plus.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:44.600]   My week went away in ways I didn't plan.
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:47.440]   This is your job, though, so it's OK.
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:47.920]   It was.
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.120]   I felt like, OK, I guess it is work.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:52.880]   I'll just spend another two or three hours in here.
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:56.960]   So I guess that's not the top story of the week after all
[00:03:56.960 --> 00:03:57.920]   is Google Plus.
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:04:03.080]   I mean, to me, this is more than Google adding another thing.
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.520]   This is more than buzz or wave.
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:07.320]   This to me-- and I think that this seems to be the case
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:08.040]   with Google as well.
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:10.400]   And I'm going to ask you, Danny, since this is your beat--
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:16.920]   is almost a reinvention of Google, a pivot of Google.
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:19.200]   Ah, I'd be mixed.
[00:04:19.200 --> 00:04:23.440]   Google is very big on saying, hey, this is just us making
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:24.840]   everything at Google Social.
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:26.520]   And it's not about competing with Facebook.
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:30.320]   It's a whole new way of looking at what you do at Google,
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:32.000]   which is a clever thing to do if you're
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:33.960]   trying to compete against Facebook,
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.920]   but you don't know if you're going to win.
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:38.880]   To me, this is very much a Facebook
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:41.600]   and to some degree a Twitter competitor.
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:45.400]   They suggested that you've got this whole sharing capability
[00:04:45.400 --> 00:04:46.880]   that's all integrated into Google,
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:49.640]   and yet the reality is not really that integrated.
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:52.800]   I can go to Google Plus, and I can share links.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:56.080]   But if I'm in Google Web Search and I want to share
[00:04:56.080 --> 00:04:59.360]   that web search, there's no integration with Google Plus,
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.040]   I can actually plus one things.
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:03.920]   But those plus ones don't actually flow back into Google
[00:05:03.920 --> 00:05:05.000]   Plus.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:07.880]   If I'm in Gmail, I don't think there's any integration of Google
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.320]   Plus that's sitting up over there.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:14.840]   It's to me very much Google Plus is a Google Plus new product
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:16.120]   that Google has rolled out.
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:18.400]   But is there any doubt that all of that is coming?
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.520]   I think that's part of the reason for the highly limited
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:21.000]   release.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.240]   It's very clear that they wanted to start small and build
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:25.640]   and have multiple iterations over a short amount of time
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:28.520]   before they build up to a public release.
[00:05:28.520 --> 00:05:30.800]   So I'm more skeptical.
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:33.080]   I think the reason they went with a limited release
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.800]   is because when they went all out with Buzz, they got burnt
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:39.920]   because they hadn't really thought about a lot of the privacy
[00:05:39.920 --> 00:05:41.520]   stuff and how it might get used.
[00:05:41.520 --> 00:05:44.000]   And so going into a limited release
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:45.880]   protects them a little bit more from that.
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:48.960]   And in fact, I think they already spotted one example of where
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.480]   I think you had shared something with a limited group
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:53.400]   and somebody reshared that with the public,
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:55.480]   then it kind of exposed it further.
[00:05:55.480 --> 00:05:57.440]   Well, but that's what we already deal with.
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.400]   Yeah, if I email something to my mom, a photo of my daughter,
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:02.400]   and she thinks it's adorable and sends it to everyone,
[00:06:02.400 --> 00:06:03.400]   it goes by the whole thing.
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:04.960]   I'm not saying that that can't happen.
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:07.480]   And in fact, even with the change that they made,
[00:06:07.480 --> 00:06:09.880]   it doesn't prevent somebody from copying a picture
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:11.720]   and re-sending it out to the public.
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:13.240]   But I think that they--
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.160]   I think one of the things that they were surprised
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.960]   and didn't expect was that by default, if you had done that,
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.120]   they made it a little harder for people to do that.
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:22.360]   I didn't think it was a big deal.
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.520]   But that was one of the examples of things
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:26.760]   that I think that they were hoping to find
[00:06:26.760 --> 00:06:28.680]   by doing the limited release.
[00:06:28.680 --> 00:06:29.880]   And I totally agree.
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:32.440]   I think they're going to roll out all sorts of new features
[00:06:32.440 --> 00:06:34.800]   and there could be all sorts of further integration with Google.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:41.440]   But I don't see this so far as, wow, we've made Google even
[00:06:41.440 --> 00:06:42.640]   more social.
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:45.200]   Let me read to you from-- and by the way,
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:47.960]   this is a primary source document which everybody
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:49.960]   who's interested in Google+ should read.
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:53.200]   Stephen Levy at Wired Magazine was
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:56.120]   able to follow this for over a year now.
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.320]   It's code named Emerald Sea.
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:01.720]   And he was invited to be part of the development plan.
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:05.640]   So there's a very good article on wired.com.
[00:07:05.640 --> 00:07:06.520]   You can read it right now.
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:09.160]   But here's the quote from Vic Gundotra,
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.160]   who is a senior vice president of social
[00:07:11.160 --> 00:07:15.240]   and the leader of this Google+ project.
[00:07:15.240 --> 00:07:18.800]   He says, "Emmerald Sea is not a Facebook killer," Gundotra told me.
[00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:21.240]   In fact, he added somewhat pukishly, quote,
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:23.640]   "People are barely tolerant of the Facebook
[00:07:23.640 --> 00:07:27.080]   they have citing a consumer satisfaction study
[00:07:27.080 --> 00:07:30.360]   that rated it barely higher than the IRS."
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:34.120]   Instead, he says, "The transformation will offer people
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:35.880]   a better Google."
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:38.800]   Do you think that disinformation or spin
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:41.080]   or do you think that's really how they're thinking, Danny?
[00:07:41.080 --> 00:07:43.120]   I mean, I think this is how they're thinking.
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:46.240]   I think they're really trying to reinvent what they're up to.
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:46.800]   So--
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:51.800]   I mean, you're saying they're going after Facebook
[00:07:51.800 --> 00:07:53.320]   and they just don't want to admit it.
[00:07:53.320 --> 00:07:54.880]   Yes, I do.
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:07:58.160]   And if that means they also don't want to admit it to themselves
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:00.240]   and perhaps that's where some of the truth lies,
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:03.320]   I think that Google often says things that they honestly
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:07.120]   believe, even if the reality is completely different.
[00:08:07.120 --> 00:08:09.640]   We don't really intend to wipe out everybody or something
[00:08:09.640 --> 00:08:10.080]   like that.
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.080]   I mean, they don't--
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.880]   We don't intend to destroy the Earth.
[00:08:12.880 --> 00:08:15.600]   Yeah, we just-- we're trying to save it.
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:17.360]   You're laughing at this, Neil IY.
[00:08:17.360 --> 00:08:19.800]   The structure of the Earth was a side product.
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:20.680]   The life effect.
[00:08:20.680 --> 00:08:23.800]   I think that Google has to really believe in their heart.
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:25.120]   Hold on, Dan.
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:25.640]   Go ahead, Neil.
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:26.160]   Neil.
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:26.680]   Go ahead.
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:27.960]   Oh, sorry.
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.600]   Now, I was saying one of the things that Google does not
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.520]   want to admit is that humans can do something's better
[00:08:33.520 --> 00:08:35.880]   than computers, right?
[00:08:35.880 --> 00:08:38.840]   And Levy's book, In the Plaques, which is excellent.
[00:08:38.840 --> 00:08:40.560]   I wish you read it.
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.200]   The long narrative arc of that book
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:44.640]   is Google slowly replaces everybody at its company
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:46.360]   with computers, right?
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.720]   And the people decide what the computers are going to do.
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.760]   And one of the things about search, which I think Google
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.200]   is having to realize, is that, all right, if you're
[00:08:54.200 --> 00:08:55.760]   going to build PageRank, and PageRank
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:58.240]   is going to scrape links between sites
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.320]   to figure out what's important and relevant,
[00:09:00.320 --> 00:09:03.720]   and you're going to ignore what actual humans who aren't
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:06.320]   publishing links are doing but are just sort of talking
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.120]   to each other, then you've got a mistake.
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.000]   Because that body of people who are sharing links
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.640]   and talking about links with their friends in a social way,
[00:09:13.640 --> 00:09:17.040]   they're generating more and better data about the internet
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:20.280]   than a bunch of a closed circle of bloggers
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:21.320]   and other sites.
[00:09:21.320 --> 00:09:23.400]   And they have to go and get those people, right?
[00:09:23.400 --> 00:09:24.800]   They have to figure out how to get that data
[00:09:24.800 --> 00:09:26.640]   and feed that into their algorithm.
[00:09:26.640 --> 00:09:30.640]   And so I think for Google, this is about recognizing,
[00:09:30.640 --> 00:09:32.760]   A, that people are better at doing this,
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:35.560]   to figure out what's important than their computer ever will be.
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:38.680]   And two, it's about getting people into the system
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:42.680]   and feeding their data about information into Google
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:43.760]   any way they can.
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:46.320]   And if they have to trick people into doing it by saying,
[00:09:46.320 --> 00:09:48.840]   oh, it looks like Facebook, that's what they're going to do.
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:51.640]   And I think that's kind of where their differentiation
[00:09:51.640 --> 00:09:53.560]   from Facebook is internally.
[00:09:53.560 --> 00:09:56.640]   Facebook's product is social networking, right?
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:58.960]   It's look at these pictures of a girl from high school.
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:00.840]   And that's a very compelling product.
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:01.960]   Google's product is search.
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:04.880]   And I think everything they do feeds in the search in that way.
[00:10:04.880 --> 00:10:08.280]   And I think that it's like they've mutated a social networking
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:10.680]   site out of their desire to improve search.
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:11.920]   So is this the case where--
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.680]   If you go back to the idea that it's all about search,
[00:10:14.680 --> 00:10:16.600]   and you talked earlier about why do we not see more
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:19.480]   plus integration in the actual search for now,
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:20.160]   that may change.
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:21.160]   And I'm kind of with Brian--
[00:10:21.160 --> 00:10:22.600]   There's no search in plus.
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:25.240]   I mean, I think that people are saying, oh, there's no hashtags.
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:26.320]   There's not even any search.
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.640]   I think this is something coming, obviously.
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:29.160]   Yeah.
[00:10:29.160 --> 00:10:31.480]   It seems like it, but are there antitrust issues at play?
[00:10:31.480 --> 00:10:33.200]   I mean, is there a reason why they would hold that back?
[00:10:33.200 --> 00:10:34.160]   No, come on.
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:37.040]   You can't-- well, Neil I is the former lawyer.
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:41.560]   But it seems to me you can't sue somebody for not including
[00:10:41.560 --> 00:10:44.880]   search and their own thing in search.
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:45.400]   Or can you?
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:47.720]   I mean, that would be awesome if you could sue for the features
[00:10:47.720 --> 00:10:49.200]   that you wanted in this device.
[00:10:49.200 --> 00:10:49.800]   I don't want them to do that.
[00:10:49.800 --> 00:10:50.840]   You can't sue for that.
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:51.340]   OK.
[00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:53.840]   You can't sue Google into putting search into Google Plus.
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:56.680]   What you can sue Google for is when they do put search into Google
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:10:57.240]   Plus.
[00:10:57.240 --> 00:10:59.600]   And actually, there are some arguments out there--
[00:10:59.600 --> 00:11:01.520]   You're saying that if YouTube, for instance, were
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:04.000]   searched better than other video sites,
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:05.880]   that would be caused for antitrust.
[00:11:05.880 --> 00:11:07.360]   So there are arguments out there.
[00:11:07.360 --> 00:11:10.080]   And the EU is going down this specific road
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.880]   where they claim Google has a natural monopoly on search
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:17.240]   now, because the way search is engineered and architected
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:19.520]   across the internet is that you have all these signals
[00:11:19.520 --> 00:11:21.120]   about what's important.
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:26.800]   So when you get a list of results and people click on results,
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:28.440]   Google gets better at searching.
[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.760]   It says, OK, most people click on the third one.
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.920]   So third one must be better than the first one.
[00:11:32.920 --> 00:11:35.920]   And all these websites feed back and forth.
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:38.680]   And they're collecting more data inherently than, say,
[00:11:38.680 --> 00:11:39.440]   Bing.
[00:11:39.440 --> 00:11:41.720]   And so if you ask Microsoft, they'll say, well, Google has
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:43.320]   a natural monopoly on search.
[00:11:43.320 --> 00:11:45.120]   They have to be restrained from exercising
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:46.840]   the monopoly in other places.
[00:11:46.840 --> 00:11:48.800]   So they start to extend the signals
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:51.920]   they can get into places like Plus, into places like YouTube.
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:53.960]   And they start to build that monopoly even stronger
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:55.240]   using outside products.
[00:11:55.240 --> 00:11:57.000]   Well, then you actually do have an argument
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:11:58.800]   that they're illegally abusing that monopoly.
[00:11:58.800 --> 00:12:00.840]   Now, whether or not any of that will happen,
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:02.400]   or any government or private party
[00:12:02.400 --> 00:12:04.800]   will make that claim, we'll have to find out.
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:06.440]   Google has to put search in Plus first.
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.400]   But it's there.
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:08.680]   It's probably something they consider.
[00:12:08.680 --> 00:12:09.760]   Isn't that sad, though?
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:11.920]   I mean, that's really what we don't want,
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:14.200]   is the government saying, OK, Google,
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:16.920]   you've got to give a head start to Bing
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:20.160]   because it's not fair that you're such a fast runner.
[00:12:20.160 --> 00:12:20.640]   Right.
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:23.160]   That's not what we want.
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:25.040]   I don't think search is there right now
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:27.800]   because it underlies the fact that this isn't a search product
[00:12:27.800 --> 00:12:30.080]   and it's not coming off of the search team.
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:31.880]   And in fact, when Buzz launched, you
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:35.160]   didn't have Buzz and you couldn't search through and find Buzz
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:35.600]   Post.
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.440]   I think that might even still be the case.
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:40.120]   It was almost like a forgotten, oh, yeah, we should do that
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.200]   as well.
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:46.200]   In contrast, Google Plus 1 system apparently came out
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:47.720]   of the search team.
[00:12:47.720 --> 00:12:49.240]   And the search team saying, well, we
[00:12:49.240 --> 00:12:51.120]   need to figure out a way for people
[00:12:51.120 --> 00:12:52.640]   to give us better signals that we're
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:56.000]   going to use for search and integrate it in that way.
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.360]   And it's entirely possible that you've
[00:12:58.360 --> 00:13:00.800]   got two rival social things that have emerged.
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:06.160]   You've got Google Plus and Google Plus 1, which are kind
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.120]   of coming together.
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:11.320]   But you could have sort of an Android Chrome type of thing
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:12.440]   that's happening.
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.400]   I thought the previous article said that Plus 1 was originally
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.040]   part of Plus and they rolled it out separately ahead of time.
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:19.440]   Did I miss read that?
[00:13:19.440 --> 00:13:20.880]   I haven't had a chance to go through this article.
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:25.200]   My sense is in many ways that's what was true about profiles.
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:26.560]   It was true about Plus.
[00:13:26.560 --> 00:13:28.160]   They've been doing this for a year and a half.
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:31.640]   Emerald Sea is not a brand new enterprise.
[00:13:31.640 --> 00:13:34.480]   And I think that a lot of what Google's been doing has been--
[00:13:34.480 --> 00:13:35.880]   Well, that's what's interesting is--
[00:13:35.880 --> 00:13:37.600]   --leaking bits of Plus out.
[00:13:37.600 --> 00:13:40.200]   When they opened Google Profile, to be honest, the only reason
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:41.320]   I filled everything out is because I
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:44.480]   hoped it would give me better SEO for people looking
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:45.720]   for fire eating or that kind of thing.
[00:13:45.720 --> 00:13:46.320]   Well, not just then.
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:49.640]   I thought it could be the canonical presence on the net.
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:51.080]   It could be identity on the net.
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:54.040]   And I forgot about it for like a year and a half later.
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:55.520]   And now, when Google Plus launches,
[00:13:55.520 --> 00:13:57.320]   I suddenly realize, oh, wait.
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:13:59.000]   I signed up for Google Plus a year and a half ago
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:00.120]   and never even knew it.
[00:14:00.120 --> 00:14:02.400]   And not only that, but as I use Google Plus,
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:05.480]   it's forcing me to acknowledge other parts of the Google
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:07.480]   ecosystem that I never would have--
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:10.080]   I would never have set foot in a Picasa until this happened.
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:11.240]   But now I want to share photos.
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.320]   I'm like, well, I guess I better get that Picasa thing rolling out.
[00:14:13.320 --> 00:14:16.320]   Well, better than that, I take you back now one year to twit.
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:18.560]   What episode of Twit is this one?
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:20.720]   You predicted-- you knew what was going on.
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:21.840]   This is a year ago.
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:24.360]   I'm not going to say that I necessarily predicted exactly
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:27.280]   circles, but I'm going to say that Google definitely owes me
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:28.280]   $1.
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:30.360]   Listen, number of options inside of this.
[00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:30.880]   Is this it?
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:31.600]   No, I agree.
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:33.080]   And maybe they'll do this on diaspora.
[00:14:33.080 --> 00:14:35.840]   But what if you just had like three different orbits?
[00:14:35.840 --> 00:14:39.040]   You had the innermost orbit, which was your family.
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.480]   And you could place-- it wasn't just
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.200]   you were a friend of them or you're not a friend.
[00:14:42.200 --> 00:14:46.240]   But you had your mercury orbit closest to the sun.
[00:14:46.240 --> 00:14:48.200]   You had your Jupiter orbit where these are friends.
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:48.960]   These are colleagues.
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:49.840]   These are coworkers.
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:52.480]   And then there's the last orbit, which is people you met at a party
[00:14:52.480 --> 00:14:53.520]   and you kind of like.
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:56.720]   And you could very quickly and simply and easily
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:14:58.880]   decide what level of content you were releasing.
[00:14:58.880 --> 00:14:59.720]   Then die a gram.
[00:14:59.720 --> 00:15:02.440]   Now when you listen to that, first of all--
[00:15:02.440 --> 00:15:04.480]   You're brilliant.
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:08.240]   Listen to now the first two sentences, the first 10 seconds
[00:15:08.240 --> 00:15:10.960]   of the Google circles explanation, which is in the
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:11.640]   box section.
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:12.240]   Is it the same?
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:13.760]   It almost sounds identical.
[00:15:13.760 --> 00:15:15.240]   And here's what I've heard since then.
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:16.240]   That was 2.48.
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:17.720]   So that was 60 tweets ago.
[00:15:17.720 --> 00:15:20.560]   I've also heard that diaspora, apparently--
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:23.240]   but people are saying that Google circles is not new
[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:25.320]   because diaspora has a similar functionality, which
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:27.440]   means diaspora also owes me $1.
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:28.480]   That's $2.
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:29.960]   That the internet owes me.
[00:15:29.960 --> 00:15:30.320]   $2.
[00:15:30.320 --> 00:15:31.840]   So here's the origin.
[00:15:31.840 --> 00:15:34.000]   And by the way, I have to commend Google.
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.320]   They obviously learned from bad launches of buzz and other
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.920]   products that there's better ways to launch a product.
[00:15:39.920 --> 00:15:40.800]   This is the--
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:43.400]   they have a lot of pretty video that they did.
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:46.160]   This is the beginning you said of their--
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:47.960]   Of their Google circles explanation.
[00:15:47.960 --> 00:15:51.160]   So if you heard what I just said there and then--
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.120]   I have a lot of different people in my life.
[00:15:53.120 --> 00:15:57.000]   My college friends, my family, my coworkers, and my biking
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:15:59.240]   buddies, just to name a few.
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:01.680]   I have lots to share, but I don't want to share everything
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:02.240]   with everyone.
[00:16:02.240 --> 00:16:03.640]   That's $1 Google.
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:04.920]   That's $1.
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:06.840]   Make it out to Brian's Brushline.
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:08.640]   All right, I'm going to take a little credit away from you,
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:09.160]   though.
[00:16:09.160 --> 00:16:09.360]   All right.
[00:16:09.360 --> 00:16:13.080]   There was a very widely circulated--
[00:16:13.080 --> 00:16:14.560]   I don't remember exactly when it was,
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:15.640]   but it was right around that time.
[00:16:15.640 --> 00:16:19.520]   Widely circulated the slide stack from a Googler.
[00:16:19.520 --> 00:16:20.200]   You remember this?
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:20.480]   Yes.
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:22.120]   Where he did exactly explain that.
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.040]   That was the problem.
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:26.560]   And Mark Zuckerberg said nobody wants to create lists.
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:28.920]   This has been bubbling up for a while.
[00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:32.200]   This issue of it's not all one blob of things
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:34.840]   as it is on Facebook, where you share pictures of you
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:39.400]   and your buddies doing the unicorn dance in your chats.
[00:16:39.400 --> 00:16:42.640]   And then your family sees that.
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.040]   So Google even said that.
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:46.040]   That this is a year ago.
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:48.920]   Well, that is the best thing about Google circles
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:52.400]   is the acknowledgement of asymmetry of perspective.
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:54.200]   And it's not like Facebook.
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:56.240]   I say you're a friend, and you say you're a friend,
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:56.920]   and we are friends.
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:57.880]   Or you make a group.
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:00.240]   Like I say we're the Tuesday night hangup club,
[00:17:00.240 --> 00:17:02.640]   and so that's what we're going to name our little group.
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:05.360]   And we're all going to say it because that's what I named it.
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:08.080]   The way I see you is not the way you see me.
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:09.640]   And so that is the beauty of circles
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:11.320]   in that you shape your own world.
[00:17:11.320 --> 00:17:14.840]   And you could put someone in like lovable family members
[00:17:14.840 --> 00:17:16.520]   who I could barely tolerate to listen to
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:18.000]   and then put them in their own circle.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.160]   All right, but let's point this out.
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:19.840]   Wednesday--
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:22.160]   So when is the first time that Google--
[00:17:22.160 --> 00:17:24.440]   the circle names leak out for somebody,
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:26.040]   and somebody gets in trouble?
[00:17:26.040 --> 00:17:27.920]   Because that's what I'm waiting for, is somebody's
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:29.880]   going to make--
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:32.120]   Lindsay Lohan is going to make assholes from the government
[00:17:32.120 --> 00:17:33.560]   one of her circles.
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:35.400]   And it's going to get leaked out.
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:37.040]   It's inevitable.
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:39.400]   The more data I give to these services
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:42.680]   about my actual opinions, the more terrified I become.
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:45.200]   Because I'm assuming somebody else will see them.
[00:17:45.200 --> 00:17:47.000]   I'm publishing them only to myself.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.640]   But it's like one checkbox away from the entire world.
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:51.560]   And we also find that--
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:52.560]   Are we also trying to--
[00:17:52.560 --> 00:17:53.560]   Are we also trying to--
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:55.640]   Except on Twitter, where you can make all your lists public.
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:57.760]   And if you want to say, "assholes, I don't like,"
[00:17:57.760 --> 00:18:01.080]   and you put them on a list, some people love that.
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.480]   And I think there's some people right now
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:05.160]   who wish they could have their circles exposed
[00:18:05.160 --> 00:18:06.080]   in exactly that way.
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:07.080]   You can't do it.
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:07.760]   Isn't there a--
[00:18:07.760 --> 00:18:11.080]   I wish I could expose circles of people
[00:18:11.080 --> 00:18:12.840]   that I've built in different areas.
[00:18:12.840 --> 00:18:15.000]   So other people who are trying to find good people
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:17.280]   could follow could do that, and you can't.
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:18.760]   I think there's a privacy setting, though,
[00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:23.560]   that says that people can't tell if you're in a circle or not.
[00:18:23.560 --> 00:18:26.880]   So I think by default, it'll show people
[00:18:26.880 --> 00:18:28.960]   you've put into circles.
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:31.800]   It will not show you the names of those specific circles
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:32.720]   you put them into.
[00:18:32.720 --> 00:18:34.240]   Which is exactly how it should be.
[00:18:34.240 --> 00:18:35.280]   Because you should know--
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:36.960]   Because if I put you in a douchebag circle,
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:38.120]   I don't want you to do that.
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:40.000]   Well, but it should acknowledge because people
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:42.560]   want to know how large their reach is.
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:44.980]   But it's like, I don't care how you interpret the results.
[00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:46.780]   So what category you put me in your mind,
[00:18:46.780 --> 00:18:48.940]   but it's important for me to know that 1,000 people
[00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:50.360]   are going to hear this when I say it,
[00:18:50.360 --> 00:18:51.640]   or may hear it when I say it.
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:53.240]   That's how long my reach is.
[00:18:53.240 --> 00:18:55.040]   And that's how I think they're going after Twitter.
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:57.920]   I think that's the important aspect of the service that
[00:18:57.920 --> 00:18:59.960]   makes it more like Twitter, is that I
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:02.840]   have a lot of followers in Google+ now
[00:19:02.840 --> 00:19:04.480]   who are not following back.
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:09.600]   I'm just in their circle of tech nerds or whatever it is.
[00:19:09.600 --> 00:19:12.240]   And I think what's funny about all of this to me
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:17.820]   is that the advance in circles is not circles.
[00:19:17.820 --> 00:19:20.180]   You can do this on Facebook with lists.
[00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:23.740]   The advance here is that the list editor is so good.
[00:19:23.740 --> 00:19:27.060]   I think that's an interesting thing to me.
[00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:28.940]   It wasn't the concept is old.
[00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:30.700]   The concept has been on Facebook for years.
[00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:33.260]   One of the most popular posts we had on Engagia,
[00:19:33.260 --> 00:19:35.620]   like evergreen piece of content we had,
[00:19:35.620 --> 00:19:37.620]   was how do you use Facebook lists?
[00:19:37.620 --> 00:19:39.820]   And the advice they gave in that post
[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:42.940]   was make three lists, call them people I don't know,
[00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:44.320]   my friends, and my family.
[00:19:44.320 --> 00:19:45.740]   And it's like, that idea is there.
[00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:47.060]   It's been there forever.
[00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:48.900]   Circles is just a really good editor.
[00:19:48.900 --> 00:19:50.700]   And circles is so upfront too, right?
[00:19:50.700 --> 00:19:53.020]   Like it's not a thing that's somehow hidden in groups
[00:19:53.020 --> 00:19:53.860]   or whatever.
[00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:55.700]   It's this thing that is the pinnacle of why you
[00:19:55.700 --> 00:19:56.980]   have a social network.
[00:19:56.980 --> 00:19:59.380]   And I think it's T minus 10 seconds
[00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:01.300]   before we hear something from Facebook that says,
[00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:02.980]   here's our version of circles.
[00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:03.620]   They're already--
[00:20:03.620 --> 00:20:04.620]   There's a circle half.
[00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:05.140]   There's a circle half.
[00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:05.660]   They already did this.
[00:20:05.660 --> 00:20:09.220]   So I don't think circles is that big a deal
[00:20:09.220 --> 00:20:12.140]   in the sense that it's not a new concept.
[00:20:12.140 --> 00:20:13.420]   What's the big deal is?
[00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:14.500]   Oh, you guys, you sound the--
[00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:15.020]   And I don't even--
[00:20:15.020 --> 00:20:16.420]   This is exactly what it sounds like, whatever.
[00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:17.540]   And I've got a lot of people, and I'm
[00:20:17.540 --> 00:20:19.060]   trying to manage through that thing.
[00:20:19.060 --> 00:20:22.100]   And let me tell you, when it crashes and it falls apart,
[00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:25.220]   or I've got four different people and I can't select them,
[00:20:25.220 --> 00:20:27.460]   there's a lot of improvements that can happen.
[00:20:27.460 --> 00:20:30.500]   I think the important thing that happening with circles
[00:20:30.500 --> 00:20:33.660]   is Facebook is giving you this ability to have clean--
[00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:37.060]   I'm sorry, Google+ is giving you this ability
[00:20:37.060 --> 00:20:41.460]   to either do the clean slate or the reset of your social network
[00:20:41.460 --> 00:20:44.100]   that you wish that maybe you could have done when you started
[00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:48.220]   Facebook or when you started Twitter, where a lot of people
[00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:49.620]   just kind of accepted everybody.
[00:20:49.620 --> 00:20:51.980]   And they didn't have these kind of grouping features.
[00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:55.540]   So this is a view with the first major social network
[00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:58.380]   we've had where the ability is now to say, you know what?
[00:20:58.380 --> 00:20:59.700]   As I start putting people in, I'm
[00:20:59.700 --> 00:21:02.020]   going to actually think about where I put them into it.
[00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:04.500]   Because I just don't think you had that with Facebook and Twitter.
[00:21:04.500 --> 00:21:07.140]   They've added those kinds of features after the fact.
[00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:09.620]   But at that point, it's like, who wants to go back and then
[00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:12.660]   start reorganizing to 2,000 people that you had,
[00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:14.860]   especially when it can be konki?
[00:21:14.860 --> 00:21:17.980]   You guys all sound like people after an Apple product
[00:21:17.980 --> 00:21:18.740]   launch.
[00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:20.340]   I don't get-- well, I'll see what the big deal is.
[00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:21.460]   It's not magical and new.
[00:21:21.460 --> 00:21:22.700]   This has been around.
[00:21:22.700 --> 00:21:23.420]   This is on.
[00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:24.700]   All right, I'll tell you what's not.
[00:21:24.700 --> 00:21:26.940]   Are you telling Google+ is the iPad?
[00:21:26.940 --> 00:21:30.740]   No, I'm telling you, it is in that it's going to be old ideas.
[00:21:30.740 --> 00:21:31.940]   Implementing it beautifully.
[00:21:31.940 --> 00:21:32.420]   Hang out.
[00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:33.220]   Yes, certainly.
[00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:34.180]   That's magical and new.
[00:21:34.180 --> 00:21:35.380]   Nobody's doing anything like it.
[00:21:35.380 --> 00:21:38.540]   Although, I know on Wednesday, Facebook's going to announce
[00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:41.460]   Skype on Facebook, right?
[00:21:41.460 --> 00:21:43.420]   Is there-- I mean, at this point, is there anything
[00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:46.100]   any company can do in software?
[00:21:46.100 --> 00:21:47.700]   Now, remember, hardware is a little more tricky.
[00:21:47.700 --> 00:21:50.740]   But in software, that can't be duplicated within weeks, right?
[00:21:50.740 --> 00:21:51.540]   Presumably.
[00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:54.700]   They do what Danny says, which is they iterate and they iterate.
[00:21:54.700 --> 00:21:57.220]   And when they iterate, they're tacking on to something
[00:21:57.220 --> 00:21:58.700]   that people have already accepted and like.
[00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:00.260]   And when you change that, people freak out.
[00:22:00.260 --> 00:22:03.500]   Anytime Facebook changes anything, everybody has a canary.
[00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:05.220]   So you can't change it too much fundamentally.
[00:22:05.220 --> 00:22:06.620]   But you can add these features.
[00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:08.940]   Google+ has the advantage of A, coming from Google, who
[00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:10.500]   could really be a player.
[00:22:10.500 --> 00:22:13.220]   And B, a company who is willing to say, all right,
[00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:15.620]   here is the things we think that all these other social networks
[00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:17.060]   should have been from the beginning.
[00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:19.180]   And they haven't had to iterate on top of that yet.
[00:22:19.180 --> 00:22:22.140]   So it's the distinct advantage the new guy has.
[00:22:22.140 --> 00:22:24.980]   Facebook had it over MySpace, MySpace had over Friendster.
[00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:28.700]   And it'll just probably keep happening in that sort of form
[00:22:28.700 --> 00:22:29.660]   from here and tell forever.
[00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:30.180]   Who knows?
[00:22:30.180 --> 00:22:30.660]   But I agree.
[00:22:30.660 --> 00:22:33.300]   We should go through kind of take a tour of Google circles.
[00:22:33.300 --> 00:22:35.420]   Because keep in mind, as we record this, I mean,
[00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:36.860]   we've all experienced a--
[00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:39.540]   Most of our listeners, the vast majority,
[00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:40.980]   can't even get in, exactly.
[00:22:40.980 --> 00:22:43.300]   And it always makes me nervous to spend this much time
[00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:45.340]   talking about something that most people can't use.
[00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:47.780]   But I think it's so important because it's from Google,
[00:22:47.780 --> 00:22:50.580]   it clearly will go more public soon.
[00:22:50.580 --> 00:22:52.420]   And it is, I think-- I'm still thinking,
[00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:53.820]   this is a big shift for Google.
[00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:56.140]   This is not merely acknowledging that it needs social
[00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:58.020]   graph in its search information.
[00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:00.180]   I think it's a new way of thinking about what Google's
[00:23:00.180 --> 00:23:00.660]   business is.
[00:23:00.660 --> 00:23:04.220]   So the moment that I truly began to grok,
[00:23:04.220 --> 00:23:07.860]   the Google+ experience, was when I was looking at my stream,
[00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:09.580]   which-- that's just so sorry.
[00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:10.260]   And then--
[00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:11.260]   You grok to stream, then?
[00:23:11.260 --> 00:23:12.540]   Yes, exactly.
[00:23:12.540 --> 00:23:15.460]   Has your stream-- how has the flow been?
[00:23:15.460 --> 00:23:17.620]   The point is, as I was looking, then all of a sudden,
[00:23:17.620 --> 00:23:18.700]   I noticed that--
[00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:21.380]   You know, Flowmax is designed for people whose streams
[00:23:21.380 --> 00:23:23.660]   have been grok'd.
[00:23:23.660 --> 00:23:26.180]   Then I noticed that Darren Kitchen from Hack 5
[00:23:26.180 --> 00:23:29.860]   was hanging out with Colleen, who built this Twitch studio.
[00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:31.300]   And I was like, well, I've got to get in on this.
[00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:33.300]   And it was electric, and it was spontaneous.
[00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:34.780]   And I was able to click one button.
[00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:36.820]   I saw that, but I was the 12th guy.
[00:23:36.820 --> 00:23:38.140]   I couldn't get in.
[00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:41.220]   Electric's spontaneous and close to me.
[00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:42.180]   It was awesome, though.
[00:23:42.180 --> 00:23:44.020]   Although, by the way, that's a problem with Hangout,
[00:23:44.020 --> 00:23:45.260]   is it's hard to close it.
[00:23:45.260 --> 00:23:46.420]   You can't--
[00:23:46.420 --> 00:23:46.940]   Right.
[00:23:46.940 --> 00:23:49.780]   And it's public by default.
[00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:51.060]   It's one of those things about Google+,
[00:23:51.060 --> 00:23:52.140]   it's like they got it.
[00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:54.860]   You want to make lists of people and have different sets
[00:23:54.860 --> 00:23:55.900]   of permissions.
[00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:57.700]   And they failed to take that to Hangouts,
[00:23:57.700 --> 00:23:59.980]   where sometimes I just want to talk to somebody
[00:23:59.980 --> 00:24:02.260]   and not have everybody know that I did it.
[00:24:02.260 --> 00:24:03.460]   Ha, ha, too bad.
[00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:04.100]   Public by default.
[00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:05.420]   Yeah, it's funny to me.
[00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:07.460]   Well, and again, you can't just invite people
[00:24:07.460 --> 00:24:08.380]   in a limited circle.
[00:24:08.380 --> 00:24:09.300]   I'm pretty sure you can.
[00:24:09.300 --> 00:24:10.540]   You can, but it will still show up.
[00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:12.060]   Want it in your stream, or maybe not?
[00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:12.700]   Yeah, it'll show up.
[00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:14.620]   People only shared it with a limited number of people
[00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:15.460]   that you're hanging out.
[00:24:15.460 --> 00:24:16.980]   It should only go to that limited number of people.
[00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:17.780]   One would think.
[00:24:17.780 --> 00:24:19.020]   I guess this is part of the problem,
[00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:21.900]   is that there's so much, as with Facebook to this,
[00:24:21.900 --> 00:24:25.420]   it's hard to predict how it's going to react.
[00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:26.420]   But here's the important thing.
[00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:29.220]   It almost to experiments to see before you do anything private.
[00:24:29.220 --> 00:24:31.860]   For instance, I am no longer taking pictures of my penis
[00:24:31.860 --> 00:24:33.860]   on my Android phone, because I don't know
[00:24:33.860 --> 00:24:35.220]   what the hell's going to happen to it.
[00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:37.540]   It apparently shows up on the web.
[00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:38.380]   Crazy enough.
[00:24:38.380 --> 00:24:40.060]   There's an instant upload.
[00:24:40.060 --> 00:24:41.140]   It uploads before--
[00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:42.060]   It uploads for iOS only.
[00:24:42.060 --> 00:24:44.900]   It uploads it before you can stop it.
[00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:46.700]   It's like already there.
[00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:47.900]   It can be like that.
[00:24:47.900 --> 00:24:50.540]   To me, the important part here is
[00:24:50.540 --> 00:24:52.180]   that all of the social networking,
[00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:54.020]   what they're trying to do is replicate
[00:24:54.020 --> 00:24:55.500]   what our brains are able to handle,
[00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:56.020]   what do they say?
[00:24:56.020 --> 00:24:57.500]   From a tribal perspective, we can only
[00:24:57.500 --> 00:25:00.460]   wrap our minds around around 150 people in a tribe beyond--
[00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:01.460]   Tundra nimby.
[00:25:01.460 --> 00:25:02.820]   Exactly.
[00:25:02.820 --> 00:25:04.900]   But social networking is starting
[00:25:04.900 --> 00:25:07.060]   to replicate other aspects that actually happen
[00:25:07.060 --> 00:25:08.940]   if we all lived in small town together.
[00:25:08.940 --> 00:25:12.900]   And Google Hangout is a fundamentally--
[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:16.060]   it's an in public meeting that anybody can walk up.
[00:25:16.060 --> 00:25:17.540]   And if I were to walk into a bar--
[00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:20.820]   and I see Sarah Lane sitting there chatting with Leo
[00:25:20.820 --> 00:25:23.140]   and Tom Merritt, and I could physically walk over.
[00:25:23.140 --> 00:25:24.140]   I could watch them talk.
[00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:25.620]   I could kind of be a fly on the wall
[00:25:25.620 --> 00:25:27.780]   and maybe contribute just a little bit.
[00:25:27.780 --> 00:25:30.540]   Again, you have an analog to a real life experience.
[00:25:30.540 --> 00:25:33.220]   And I think that's part of what makes it such an electric
[00:25:33.220 --> 00:25:33.780]   experience.
[00:25:33.780 --> 00:25:36.420]   I guess my point is this is so early days.
[00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:37.820]   It's not even open to the public.
[00:25:37.820 --> 00:25:40.300]   So it's kind of hard to look at a feature and say,
[00:25:40.300 --> 00:25:42.580]   this is good, this is bad, this needs to be fixed.
[00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:44.060]   All of this is going to change.
[00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:47.860]   I'm looking at a more metal level about what this tells us
[00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:50.860]   about what Google is interested in.
[00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:51.380]   Well, this is--
[00:25:51.380 --> 00:25:56.100]   Well, this is not deny Danny that this is a major initiative
[00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:56.540]   from Google.
[00:25:56.540 --> 00:25:59.860]   This is not just another wave or a buzz, or is it?
[00:25:59.860 --> 00:26:02.460]   Yeah, I think this is Buzz 2.0.
[00:26:02.460 --> 00:26:02.940]   Oh, you do?
[00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:03.820]   No way.
[00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:05.100]   Oh, I think it's so much bigger than this one.
[00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:06.420]   I do.
[00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:07.580]   And can I say why--
[00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:08.260]   I mean, I agree.
[00:26:08.260 --> 00:26:09.340]   It looks just like Buzz.
[00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:11.020]   But I think it's so much bigger than this one.
[00:26:11.020 --> 00:26:12.620]   It's like they launched Buzz, and it was like,
[00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:14.620]   we're going to try to compete with Facebook,
[00:26:14.620 --> 00:26:17.260]   but we aren't going to really say that we're going to do it.
[00:26:17.260 --> 00:26:18.740]   And now we're getting circles, and they're
[00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:19.900]   competing with Facebook, but they're
[00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:21.460]   not saying that they're going to do it.
[00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:23.420]   And I think they're clever on the PR.
[00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:25.660]   I'm not denying that they've got more integration that's
[00:26:25.660 --> 00:26:27.300]   going on throughout Google, and that there'll
[00:26:27.300 --> 00:26:28.460]   be more of that to be coming.
[00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:32.300]   But first of all, if you're running a social network,
[00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:35.500]   your social network better not be dependent on people
[00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:37.500]   using all of your services, because not everybody
[00:26:37.500 --> 00:26:39.020]   uses your services.
[00:26:39.020 --> 00:26:40.980]   So it has to be independent to that.
[00:26:40.980 --> 00:26:44.620]   This thing that they're building cannot just be Google plus.
[00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:45.700]   Yeah, but it will be.
[00:26:45.700 --> 00:26:47.100]   They're releasing the API.
[00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:48.860]   People are going to be able to do other applications.
[00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:50.380]   You're going to be able to access it different ways.
[00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:53.700]   The idea of Google plus is that it's Google plus more.
[00:26:53.700 --> 00:26:55.660]   And actually, what you need to have
[00:26:55.660 --> 00:26:59.660]   is for this to be successful is really nothing to do with Google.
[00:26:59.660 --> 00:27:01.780]   It needs to be web plus.
[00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:03.340]   It needs to be life plus.
[00:27:03.340 --> 00:27:04.340]   The only thing--
[00:27:04.340 --> 00:27:05.340]   The only thing--
[00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:05.840]   Go ahead.
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:06.340]   Go ahead.
[00:27:06.340 --> 00:27:07.780]   Well, I was just going to say, the only thing
[00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:09.540]   it really needs to be successful is to get people
[00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:10.300]   to jump on it.
[00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:11.860]   And they did something very clever,
[00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:13.100]   and it's so elementary.
[00:27:13.100 --> 00:27:16.060]   It goes back to how to win friends and influence people
[00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:18.340]   on that new black bar on the top of everything
[00:27:18.340 --> 00:27:19.060]   you do in Google.
[00:27:19.060 --> 00:27:20.220]   It's there.
[00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:22.060]   It doesn't say Google plus.
[00:27:22.060 --> 00:27:23.620]   It says your first name.
[00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:25.780]   And I'm sitting there in Gmail doing work.
[00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:28.300]   And my eye keeps going back to my name in that upper left-hand
[00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:28.800]   corner.
[00:27:28.800 --> 00:27:30.340]   Why none of us got anything done this way.
[00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:31.020]   Exactly.
[00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:33.020]   I mean, it's that kind of thinking
[00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:34.460]   that's going to make them a force with this.
[00:27:34.460 --> 00:27:36.300]   And of course, they've shown--
[00:27:36.300 --> 00:27:37.700]   Google is like the board with this.
[00:27:37.700 --> 00:27:40.100]   They have announced that they want the search data that's
[00:27:40.100 --> 00:27:42.300]   inside Facebook and Facebook is not giving it up.
[00:27:42.300 --> 00:27:43.780]   So they walk to the empty lot next door
[00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:45.340]   and they start building a craft.
[00:27:45.340 --> 00:27:47.260]   And at first, it's this rickety ship called
[00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:48.580]   Orkus or whatever it was called.
[00:27:48.580 --> 00:27:49.080]   Cut.
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:49.860]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:51.780]   And then it immediately fell apart.
[00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:53.980]   And then like the board, they went back and did buzz.
[00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:56.020]   This is clean on for a friend me.
[00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:56.500]   Exactly.
[00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:57.660]   What a cut.
[00:27:57.660 --> 00:27:58.900]   And now they're coming back again.
[00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:01.900]   Orkut happened way before Facebook.
[00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:02.460]   Yeah, it did.
[00:28:02.460 --> 00:28:04.060]   Then in terms of them, they've got
[00:28:04.060 --> 00:28:06.020]   to get the social graph because they won't do it.
[00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:09.500]   So like two weeks ago, the folks at SEO MOS
[00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:11.700]   released their data where they turn up all this stuff
[00:28:11.700 --> 00:28:13.820]   to try to figure out what the top ranking signals are
[00:28:13.820 --> 00:28:15.580]   and the things that really caused you to do well
[00:28:15.580 --> 00:28:17.060]   in Google's top results.
[00:28:17.060 --> 00:28:19.060]   And one of the top things that they found
[00:28:19.060 --> 00:28:21.420]   was a strong correlation between things that were shared
[00:28:21.420 --> 00:28:23.900]   on Facebook and things that ranked well on Google.
[00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:26.420]   And so there was everybody going, aha, see, that's it.
[00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:27.460]   Get shared on Facebook.
[00:28:27.460 --> 00:28:29.340]   You show up on Google, except Google turned around
[00:28:29.340 --> 00:28:31.820]   and said, we don't use any of that data.
[00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:33.940]   And then there was some debate going on line.
[00:28:33.940 --> 00:28:35.420]   And then they did more research.
[00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:36.900]   And they would said, actually, we
[00:28:36.900 --> 00:28:38.860]   agree that Google wasn't lying to us.
[00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:40.940]   They apparently don't use the Google share data.
[00:28:40.940 --> 00:28:42.380]   And then people said, but you could
[00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:44.420]   see why they'd want to use the Google share data
[00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:46.940]   because it corresponds so strongly with good search results.
[00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:48.860]   At which point, I'm thinking, what on earth
[00:28:48.860 --> 00:28:50.100]   are you talking about?
[00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:52.900]   What it tells you is, even without the Facebook data,
[00:28:52.900 --> 00:28:54.340]   they already have good search results.
[00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:57.660]   So clearly, they do not need to have this Facebook data
[00:28:57.660 --> 00:28:59.700]   to get quality search results.
[00:28:59.700 --> 00:29:02.820]   Having said that, having the things that people like,
[00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:05.500]   having social signals, I think are very good things
[00:29:05.500 --> 00:29:06.300]   for them to bring in.
[00:29:06.300 --> 00:29:07.300]   I think it will help them.
[00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:09.580]   I think that that's very much the new kind of link
[00:29:09.580 --> 00:29:11.220]   counting that goes out there.
[00:29:11.220 --> 00:29:14.740]   And having something like plus or plus one or whatever
[00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:16.660]   plus thing they want to call it, I
[00:29:16.660 --> 00:29:18.900]   think that's an essential part of them going forward
[00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:21.620]   and dealing with the fact that the link graph that they've
[00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:24.340]   been using has become more and more polluted.
[00:29:24.340 --> 00:29:27.700]   But I think that some of the social stuff gets overstated.
[00:29:27.700 --> 00:29:32.340]   And even if they hadn't done this,
[00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:35.260]   they're pulling in stuff from, say, Twitter already
[00:29:35.260 --> 00:29:37.460]   that they can go through and see some of the social stuff that
[00:29:37.460 --> 00:29:38.420]   comes along.
[00:29:38.420 --> 00:29:43.100]   But no doubt, having it, this is a key part of them going forward.
[00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:45.660]   And I think if you go back to Stephen's article,
[00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:46.740]   I actually had gone through it.
[00:29:46.740 --> 00:29:48.700]   And I pulled it up to skim through the thing that stood out
[00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:51.900]   for me much, much more about that they're concerned with
[00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:55.220]   is the idea that Facebook is this closed web, this thing
[00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:56.460]   that they can't see into.
[00:29:56.460 --> 00:29:57.460]   That's right.
[00:29:57.460 --> 00:29:59.740]   And that this kind of maybe for them
[00:29:59.740 --> 00:30:01.740]   forces some of this data to come out.
[00:30:01.740 --> 00:30:05.740]   Or offers an alternative that's not owned by Facebook.
[00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:06.260]   Sure.
[00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:08.980]   So I'm wondering, the thing about Google+ right now for me
[00:30:08.980 --> 00:30:09.660]   is--
[00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:10.620]   fine, it's a competitor.
[00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:14.220]   But right now, to me, it looks like every other part
[00:30:14.220 --> 00:30:16.300]   of my working day with services, right?
[00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:20.580]   Because it's full of tech journalists and PR people, right?
[00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:22.220]   Regular people are going to sign up for it.
[00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:23.940]   It's going to be very different, isn't it?
[00:30:23.940 --> 00:30:25.780]   Right.
[00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:27.060]   But their friends aren't going to be there.
[00:30:27.060 --> 00:30:28.740]   And they're going to say, why should they use this?
[00:30:28.740 --> 00:30:30.580]   And they're going to go back to Facebook.
[00:30:30.580 --> 00:30:32.940]   Are you saying that you cannot overcome the network
[00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:35.780]   effect that this will not succeed because of the network
[00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:36.540]   effect?
[00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:37.900]   I don't know.
[00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:40.340]   It depends on how Google decides to actually market it
[00:30:40.340 --> 00:30:41.020]   to real people.
[00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:42.580]   I think these videos that came out.
[00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:44.720]   I don't know if you saw it, but I did a YouTube double
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:47.540]   or mashup of one of them, where the narration is exactly
[00:30:47.540 --> 00:30:50.060]   that of an old folk zone.
[00:30:50.060 --> 00:30:52.060]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:30:52.060 --> 00:30:53.580]   I agree entirely with you.
[00:30:53.580 --> 00:30:56.740]   I think that it's very exciting right now because it was sort--
[00:30:56.740 --> 00:30:59.060]   I was thinking that Google+ right now is almost
[00:30:59.060 --> 00:31:00.900]   like the tech meme of social networks.
[00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:04.460]   And what I mean by that is practically nobody reads tech
[00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:05.340]   meme.
[00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:08.500]   Although people in the tech industry read it heavily.
[00:31:08.500 --> 00:31:10.540]   And what happens there really matters.
[00:31:10.540 --> 00:31:13.900]   Google+ has got this huge elite audience of people
[00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:14.980]   that are in there.
[00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:16.060]   I mean, it is amazing.
[00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:18.100]   You walk in and you're like, wow, did I just
[00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:19.180]   stumble into Ted or something?
[00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:20.460]   What's going on here?
[00:31:20.460 --> 00:31:21.460]   Because it's so relatively cool.
[00:31:21.460 --> 00:31:23.140]   I think that's why people are there.
[00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:25.940]   But when that spreads out--
[00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:29.620]   and if you're happy with Facebook,
[00:31:29.620 --> 00:31:32.500]   and it's doing everything you need it to do,
[00:31:32.500 --> 00:31:34.940]   and you haven't had the privacy concerns,
[00:31:34.940 --> 00:31:36.420]   you've got all your video stuff there,
[00:31:36.420 --> 00:31:38.100]   and you're used to going in there,
[00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:41.020]   I think it's still a really big challenge to convince you,
[00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:42.820]   I want to go over and start using Google+.
[00:31:42.820 --> 00:31:45.100]   And you know who's going to be hard to convince?
[00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:46.740]   Are the ones that are happy with Facebook?
[00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:50.020]   It's my mom on this end, and it's my kids on this end.
[00:31:50.020 --> 00:31:51.780]   And I talk to them all week about you guys
[00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:53.100]   should see how cool Google+ is.
[00:31:53.100 --> 00:31:54.380]   Yeah, you can't move over there.
[00:31:54.380 --> 00:31:56.540]   Yeah, both sides were going, whatever, dad, whatever.
[00:31:56.540 --> 00:31:57.820]   You're such a loser, dad.
[00:31:57.820 --> 00:31:59.020]   Why do you even care?
[00:31:59.020 --> 00:32:00.260]   You're such a--
[00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:01.460]   Yeah, no, I got that too.
[00:32:01.460 --> 00:32:01.860]   It's like--
[00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:03.460]   And they're going to have to ungeek the slide.
[00:32:03.460 --> 00:32:05.740]   They're going to have to un-check the slide to make it work.
[00:32:05.740 --> 00:32:08.180]   This is the same challenge that being faced
[00:32:08.180 --> 00:32:09.540]   is when they go up against Google, right?
[00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:11.740]   They build a search engine and a credible search engine,
[00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:14.100]   and in some ways, a better search engine for certain things
[00:32:14.100 --> 00:32:16.820]   than Google, but people keep using Google.
[00:32:16.820 --> 00:32:18.380]   But easy to use for your Google--
[00:32:18.380 --> 00:32:18.780]   But easy to use for your Google--
[00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:19.380]   Google has a--
[00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:19.860]   It works.
[00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:20.540]   Isn't this part of the way?
[00:32:20.540 --> 00:32:21.580]   Why do they want to go over and use something
[00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:22.860]   that they don't have any trust with?
[00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:25.900]   Because they're already visiting Google every single day.
[00:32:25.900 --> 00:32:27.580]   They're already using Google.
[00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:30.020]   So I don't think they'll be a mass exodus,
[00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:31.660]   but I think they'll be a trickle.
[00:32:31.660 --> 00:32:34.220]   And especially because you can add people to your circle
[00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:35.700]   who aren't on Google+.
[00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:37.580]   And they're able to participate by email.
[00:32:37.580 --> 00:32:39.540]   And you're able to send out that photo to your grandma
[00:32:39.540 --> 00:32:40.740]   or all these people who refuse.
[00:32:40.740 --> 00:32:43.420]   And at some point, they're just like, oh, I'm on the Google
[00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:44.940]   anyway, what's this plus next to my name?
[00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:45.860]   And then they're in.
[00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:48.060]   Because so many people are already on Facebook
[00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:49.620]   and have a Gmail account or use Google.
[00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:51.260]   I think you might be overestimating
[00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:53.060]   how many people are logged into Google accounts.
[00:32:53.060 --> 00:32:55.460]   And I think one thing that we all do
[00:32:55.460 --> 00:32:58.620]   is tech journalists and tech people
[00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:02.420]   is that we wildly overestimate how many people use Gmail.
[00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:03.540]   Because Gmail is my--
[00:33:03.540 --> 00:33:05.220]   I think that's true.
[00:33:05.220 --> 00:33:07.100]   I mean, that's how my life works.
[00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:08.340]   And I'm like, oh, everybody should do it.
[00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:10.020]   But most people are using AOL still.
[00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:10.540]   I agree.
[00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:10.540]   Right.
[00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:12.980]   Most people use a Hotmail on pop.
[00:33:12.980 --> 00:33:15.660]   This idea that you're going to see it all the time.
[00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:16.940]   You will see that black bar.
[00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:17.860]   It's going to work for me.
[00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:19.860]   Well, you do see that my parents are not logged into Google.
[00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:23.180]   They don't understand why they're seeing the black bar.
[00:33:23.180 --> 00:33:25.420]   Do you have any numbers explaining
[00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:27.220]   why that black bar was even there in the first place?
[00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:29.860]   Do you have numbers, Danny, on how many people
[00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:30.820]   have Google accounts?
[00:33:30.820 --> 00:33:33.060]   How widespread is that?
[00:33:33.060 --> 00:33:33.980]   I don't.
[00:33:33.980 --> 00:33:36.340]   I don't know those numbers offhand.
[00:33:36.340 --> 00:33:37.980]   Lots of people have Google accounts.
[00:33:37.980 --> 00:33:39.380]   It's just kind of natural to use them.
[00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:41.180]   Millions and millions of them.
[00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:43.180]   But is it the majority of users or is it
[00:33:43.180 --> 00:33:45.380]   a fraction of all users?
[00:33:45.380 --> 00:33:46.980]   I haven't seen any data like that.
[00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:47.460]   We don't know.
[00:33:47.460 --> 00:33:48.220]   I guess we don't know.
[00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:49.780]   I have a feeling the hive mind of the chat room
[00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:51.100]   is about to take care of that force.
[00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:54.460]   I think your best proxy to that is probably people
[00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:56.060]   who have Gmail accounts.
[00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:58.580]   Because that seems to be the biggest reason why
[00:33:58.580 --> 00:34:00.780]   you would have a Google account outside of I'm running
[00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:02.300]   AdWords or I'm running AdSense.
[00:34:02.300 --> 00:34:04.340]   And it also seems the biggest reason why you'd probably
[00:34:04.340 --> 00:34:05.860]   be logged into Google.
[00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:07.820]   There are people who have reader and they log into reader,
[00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:09.580]   but that's more of a niche product, it seems.
[00:34:09.580 --> 00:34:12.140]   There's people who may log into web search or whatever.
[00:34:12.140 --> 00:34:15.980]   But I think your Gmail numbers probably
[00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:18.140]   tell you the real story of what's going on
[00:34:18.140 --> 00:34:19.620]   in the potential audience.
[00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:20.860]   And that's also intriguing.
[00:34:20.860 --> 00:34:22.780]   Because then if all these people are using Gmail
[00:34:22.780 --> 00:34:24.620]   and they're loving it and they're rocking along with it
[00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:28.540]   and that pulls them in, Facebook rolled out Facebook Mail.
[00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:30.940]   And they rolled that out about six months ago now.
[00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:33.140]   And I think it's just kind of been sitting there.
[00:34:33.140 --> 00:34:35.700]   And at some point, maybe they ramp it up.
[00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:38.220]   And they-- it's pretty cool.
[00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:40.900]   I mean, you can go through and you can respond to people
[00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:43.540]   from your email box and you don't have to have the subject
[00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:44.780]   line, you don't have to do these things,
[00:34:44.780 --> 00:34:47.540]   you don't have to go back into Facebook.
[00:34:47.540 --> 00:34:49.940]   From Wikipedia as of November 2010,
[00:34:49.940 --> 00:34:53.460]   so that's already almost a year ago, 193 million users
[00:34:53.460 --> 00:34:55.500]   monthly on Gmail.
[00:34:55.500 --> 00:34:58.020]   So that's not even the number of accounts.
[00:34:58.020 --> 00:34:59.660]   But it's not as big as Hotmail.
[00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:00.660]   Right, then you can Hotmail.
[00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:01.460]   It's like 500 million.
[00:35:01.460 --> 00:35:03.300]   Yeah, Hotmail's much bigger.
[00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:06.580]   Yeah, but I mean, it's a lot of people.
[00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:10.860]   They have potential to build a really solid social network
[00:35:10.860 --> 00:35:12.740]   to take on Facebook.
[00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:13.340]   There's also the--
[00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:14.980]   Let's not forget, somebody's saying in the chat room,
[00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:16.220]   this is absolutely true.
[00:35:16.220 --> 00:35:19.820]   500,000 Android activations a day,
[00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:21.540]   those people all are strong.
[00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:24.540]   I mean, Android really works well with Plus.
[00:35:24.540 --> 00:35:25.820]   Much better than iPhone works.
[00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:27.780]   Much better than iOS.
[00:35:27.780 --> 00:35:30.660]   Chat room reminds us as well, Android, YouTube,
[00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:31.540]   all that kind of stuff.
[00:35:31.540 --> 00:35:33.100]   Those are all Google accounts.
[00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:34.620]   So when you're signed into YouTube,
[00:35:34.620 --> 00:35:35.580]   you're using a Google account.
[00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:36.940]   When you're using a Android phone.
[00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:37.380]   Yeah.
[00:35:37.380 --> 00:35:38.340]   That's a lot of people.
[00:35:38.340 --> 00:35:40.260]   So I'm just saying, I don't think they'll be a mass exodus.
[00:35:40.260 --> 00:35:41.900]   I don't think you're going to see the kind of thing that
[00:35:41.900 --> 00:35:45.780]   happened to MySpace happen to Facebook.
[00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:49.460]   But I think there may be this kind of trickling effect
[00:35:49.460 --> 00:35:49.900]   that's slow.
[00:35:49.900 --> 00:35:52.220]   And I don't think people want to be as big as Facebook.
[00:35:52.220 --> 00:35:53.620]   They don't think they need to be, do they?
[00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:55.100]   Is that what they're called?
[00:35:55.100 --> 00:35:56.420]   I was going to say I predicted it'll
[00:35:56.420 --> 00:35:59.420]   be something that happens in parallel to Facebook.
[00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:01.980]   And at some point, you'll just forget to log into Facebook
[00:36:01.980 --> 00:36:02.500]   that day.
[00:36:02.500 --> 00:36:03.620]   I made it two days in a row.
[00:36:03.620 --> 00:36:04.180]   You'll forget to log in.
[00:36:04.180 --> 00:36:05.940]   Did you see my new Facebook profile?
[00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:07.300]   I did indeed.
[00:36:07.300 --> 00:36:08.820]   Can you throw that back on there?
[00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:10.020]   Yeah, let me see if I can--
[00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:11.860]   I think that was before we even started the show there.
[00:36:11.860 --> 00:36:12.660]   Yeah, it was before the show.
[00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:14.220]   But the moment you saw that photo,
[00:36:14.220 --> 00:36:16.660]   it was like it just says, I have moved handwritten
[00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:19.060]   scrawled on there and it has a cheap Plus.
[00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:22.220]   My Facebook profile image has changed a little bit.
[00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:24.700]   And I just wanted to point this out.
[00:36:24.700 --> 00:36:28.100]   Now, I don't know what my mother's going to make of this at all.
[00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:30.780]   She's going to say, honey, did you leave Petaloma?
[00:36:30.780 --> 00:36:32.780]   Where did you go?
[00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:33.860]   I have moved.
[00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:36.180]   But the truth is, it's not that I've moved really,
[00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:39.620]   but that don't count on me to being in Facebook every day.
[00:36:39.620 --> 00:36:41.460]   Facebook didn't have to be for a long time.
[00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:42.580]   That's a really weird thing.
[00:36:42.580 --> 00:36:48.940]   I mean, to come back and let's have a reality check type of thing.
[00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:54.220]   First of all, Facebook has the degree of discovery technology
[00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:56.060]   that Google has in terms of search technology.
[00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:57.460]   You're trying to find something.
[00:36:57.460 --> 00:36:58.860]   Google finds that needle.
[00:36:58.860 --> 00:37:02.580]   Facebook has huge amounts of investment and time put into,
[00:37:02.580 --> 00:37:05.500]   how do I pop up the stuff that's actually more relevant to you?
[00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:05.940]   It only takes--
[00:37:05.940 --> 00:37:08.900]   They do do a much better job on that wall.
[00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:11.140]   You're like going, I just saw this and they've had to fix it.
[00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:13.180]   And I know that they'll fine tune that sort of stuff.
[00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:16.700]   But Facebook seems to be very, very hypersensitive
[00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:19.060]   that for us to have a good system,
[00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:20.700]   we need to surface up the things that you're
[00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:22.220]   going to be most interested in.
[00:37:22.220 --> 00:37:24.060]   And Google has a lot of learning to do there.
[00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:25.220]   I don't know what that they do.
[00:37:25.220 --> 00:37:28.900]   I find the important and unread section of the Gmail
[00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:32.260]   to be super naturally precise, as far as knowing what I care about.
[00:37:32.260 --> 00:37:33.380]   Use your priority, and Bob.
[00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:34.460]   Yeah, yeah, absolutely.
[00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:35.380]   Hey, I want to take a break.
[00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:36.540]   Danny, do you want to stick around?
[00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:37.300]   I know.
[00:37:37.300 --> 00:37:40.140]   But the other thing I want to say is, OK.
[00:37:40.140 --> 00:37:46.820]   Danny, Danny must be on one of the famous three second legs.
[00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:48.220]   Do you have time to stick around?
[00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:51.060]   Because I know that we don't have you all day.
[00:37:51.060 --> 00:37:52.740]   Yeah, I can go for about another 15 minutes.
[00:37:52.740 --> 00:37:56.100]   OK, because I do want to bring up a couple of other things.
[00:37:56.100 --> 00:37:57.820]   I know we're doing a lot on Google Plus,
[00:37:57.820 --> 00:37:59.420]   but I think that was the biggest story of the week.
[00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:01.740]   We emailed you the YouTube link, the YouTube.
[00:38:01.740 --> 00:38:02.620]   I'll play that.
[00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:03.180]   I'll play that.
[00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:04.820]   We're going to take a break when we come back.
[00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:07.500]   But we're also going to start doing something new on the show,
[00:38:07.500 --> 00:38:09.660]   because we have a great news show, a tech news show,
[00:38:09.660 --> 00:38:11.220]   that's every Monday through Friday.
[00:38:11.220 --> 00:38:12.820]   We call it Tech News Today.
[00:38:12.820 --> 00:38:14.780]   And what we've asked Tom to do-- and we're
[00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:16.500]   going to start doing this every week on Twitter--
[00:38:16.500 --> 00:38:20.140]   is prepare us a little short minute summary of the stories
[00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:22.620]   that they're going to be covering and watching all week
[00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:23.120]   along.
[00:38:23.120 --> 00:38:24.180]   So it's kind of a preview of what's
[00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:29.420]   ahead in Tech News from our good friend Tom Merritt on Tech
[00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:30.140]   News Today.
[00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:32.060]   So let me go to that.
[00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:33.820]   This is where he actually predicts all the news
[00:38:33.820 --> 00:38:34.660]   for the rest of the next week.
[00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:36.180]   It's actually his prediction.
[00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:38.700]   For this is what you'll be talking about next week.
[00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:43.900]   It's pretty slow right now, but it's going to pick up.
[00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:45.420]   Hey, I'm Tom Merritt from Tech News Today.
[00:38:45.420 --> 00:38:49.020]   Here are some of the stories we'll be keeping an eye on in the week ahead.
[00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:52.940]   Monday, July 4, STS-135 astronauts arrive,

[00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:03.220]   Tuesday, July 5, Sprint is updating the Samsung Galaxy
[00:39:03.220 --> 00:39:05.380]   tab with gingerbread.
[00:39:05.380 --> 00:39:08.940]   Wednesday, July 6, Huffpo's UK edition launches,

[00:39:12.740 --> 00:39:18.180]   Also, July 6, Facebook says they have a mysterious awesome thing
[00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:19.180]   to be announced.
[00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:20.780]   People say it's Skype integration.
[00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:23.060]   So people say it's going to be an iPad app.
[00:39:23.060 --> 00:39:25.180]   We'll find out Wednesday, July 6.
[00:39:25.180 --> 00:39:28.380]   Not to be upstaged, the first Twitter town hall
[00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:32.220]   with President Obama will take place on July 6 at 2 PM Eastern.
[00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:35.780]   Use the hashtag #AskObama to ask questions.
[00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:39.500]   Thursday, July 7, Verizon's tier data plans are coming,
[00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:41.500]   starting at around $30.

[00:39:48.180 --> 00:39:50.980]   It's the reboot of the popular Doctor Who spin-off.
[00:39:50.980 --> 00:39:54.500]   And Friday, July 8, the final space shuttle mission,
[00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:56.700]   Weather Permitting, is scheduled to launch
[00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:58.780]   at 11.26 AM Eastern time.
[00:39:58.780 --> 00:40:01.060]   Those are some of the stories for the week ahead.
[00:40:01.060 --> 00:40:02.220]   On time, Eric, back to you, Leo.
[00:40:02.220 --> 00:40:04.020]   We're going to name him Tom Stradamis.
[00:40:04.020 --> 00:40:07.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:40:07.140 --> 00:40:09.220]   Thank you, Tom, Eric, and thanks to the guy in the chat room
[00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:11.500]   who I stole this joke.
[00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:12.940]   We'll be right back with a great panel.
[00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:14.900]   We've got Brian Brushwood in studio,
[00:40:14.900 --> 00:40:18.140]   and Eli Patel from thisismynext.com.
[00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:20.580]   Danny Sullivan from searchengineland.com,
[00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:23.420]   and my good friend, what's his name?
[00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:25.860]   And he'll be-- there he is, the Gmail blog.
[00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:26.700]   No.
[00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:28.740]   Tom, I've screwed up here.
[00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:29.700]   There we go.
[00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:32.380]   I can give you a hand.
[00:40:32.380 --> 00:40:34.500]   Scott Johnson, there we go.
[00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:35.780]   No, goddamn it.
[00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:39.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:40.460]   There he is.
[00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:42.500]   No.
[00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:43.300]   There he is.
[00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:44.580]   No, I give up.
[00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:46.180]   We'll get you, Scott, later.
[00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:46.660]   No, I would.
[00:40:46.660 --> 00:40:48.020]   But right now, I would like to talk a little bit
[00:40:48.020 --> 00:40:51.380]   about our friends at Squarespace.com.
[00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:51.860]   You know what?
[00:40:51.860 --> 00:40:55.260]   This is ironic, because I literally just created a trial
[00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:58.820]   account and created poor, poor Scott.squarespace.com.
[00:40:58.820 --> 00:41:00.580]   It's amazing how quickly you could do that.
[00:41:00.580 --> 00:41:02.260]   Well, because it doesn't require any credit card.
[00:41:02.260 --> 00:41:03.220]   No, you could do it right now.
[00:41:03.220 --> 00:41:05.740]   In fact, did you do that when they meet or somebody?
[00:41:05.740 --> 00:41:08.060]   We were saying, let's do an experiment
[00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:10.980]   and see how quickly you can create a Squarespace account?
[00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:11.460]   Oh, sure.
[00:41:11.460 --> 00:41:11.820]   Yeah.
[00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:12.300]   Well, I mean--
[00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:13.260]   You've done that on your show.
[00:41:13.260 --> 00:41:14.020]   Oh, a number of times.
[00:41:14.020 --> 00:41:16.540]   In fact, we hold the record center world record
[00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:19.060]   for the fastest website from conception
[00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:21.100]   to execution in the entire world.
[00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:22.500]   And what is that record?
[00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:23.780]   It's like 20 seconds.
[00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:24.940]   And it wasn't using--
[00:41:24.940 --> 00:41:25.940]   It was using--
[00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:27.140]   It was using Scott Johnson?
[00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:28.780]   It was using Scott Johnson?
[00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:30.500]   Scott Johnson was using Squarespace.
[00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:31.060]   There we go.
[00:41:31.060 --> 00:41:33.100]   I got to press the buttons right.
[00:41:33.100 --> 00:41:35.100]   It's a long, involved story.
[00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:38.580]   But apparently, Scott and my computer have merged.
[00:41:38.580 --> 00:41:39.140]   They've melded.
[00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:39.860]   He's now bored.
[00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:41.260]   Melded together.
[00:41:41.260 --> 00:41:43.940]   Squarespace.com is a secret behind exceptional website.
[00:41:43.940 --> 00:41:44.580]   It's OK, watch.
[00:41:44.580 --> 00:41:44.900]   Count.
[00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:45.500]   Start counting.
[00:41:45.500 --> 00:41:47.580]   1,000, 2, 1,000.
[00:41:47.580 --> 00:41:49.460]   3, 1,000, 4, 1,000.
[00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:51.420]   You know what takes a long time?
[00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:53.180]   Deciding the name.
[00:41:53.180 --> 00:41:57.740]   Brian is a unicorn.
[00:41:57.740 --> 00:41:58.740]   There you go.
[00:41:58.740 --> 00:42:00.940]   .squarespace.com.
[00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:04.100]   Password, flowers.
[00:42:04.100 --> 00:42:07.540]   Email address, Brian--
[00:42:07.540 --> 00:42:08.180]   Brain.
[00:42:08.180 --> 00:42:12.580]   Brian@neverland.com.
[00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:13.060]   OK.
[00:42:13.060 --> 00:42:14.060]   So now, that's it.
[00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:14.740]   Now I've got a site.
[00:42:14.740 --> 00:42:15.220]   Boom.
[00:42:15.220 --> 00:42:15.700]   Boom.
[00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:16.140]   That's it.
[00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:16.980]   That was pretty quick.
[00:42:16.980 --> 00:42:17.460]   That's it.
[00:42:17.460 --> 00:42:19.300]   And so does everybody watching Twitch.
[00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:20.580]   Because you have the--
[00:42:20.580 --> 00:42:21.060]   you know what?
[00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:23.420]   Because they have the password, I guarantee you,
[00:42:23.420 --> 00:42:24.540]   within the next 30 seconds--
[00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:25.540]   Oh, you think?
[00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:26.540]   It's all going to be a rush now.
[00:42:26.540 --> 00:42:27.860]   I don't even have to, because I gave out the password.
[00:42:27.860 --> 00:42:29.500]   Yeah, everyone has the flowers.
[00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:30.900]   Everyone has the flowers.
[00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:32.780]   Everyone has the flowers.
[00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:36.420]   So let's go ahead and make that Brian as a unicorn.squarespace.com
[00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:38.260]   at exdispecial.
[00:42:38.260 --> 00:42:41.100]   In the next two weeks, you all have complete privileges.
[00:42:41.100 --> 00:42:41.980]   So log in there.
[00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:42.940]   Oh my god.
[00:42:42.940 --> 00:42:44.460]   Should I just-- should I view website?
[00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:45.260]   Yeah, let's take a look.
[00:42:45.260 --> 00:42:47.060]   See, we're going to wait till the end of the commercial.
[00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:47.340]   There we go.
[00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:48.780]   Give you a minute or two to mess with it.
[00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:50.060]   See, this is the beauty of Squarespace.
[00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:53.900]   If you go to squarespace.com, it is very easy to create a site.
[00:42:53.900 --> 00:42:56.500]   This is the hosting plus the software,
[00:42:56.500 --> 00:42:58.740]   but not just a site, a great site.
[00:42:58.740 --> 00:43:01.260]   Just take a look at some of the examples at squarespace.com
[00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:02.380]   of wonderful sites.
[00:43:02.380 --> 00:43:04.460]   We use it for our inside Twit blog.
[00:43:04.460 --> 00:43:06.460]   Kevin Rose uses it for his blog.
[00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:07.860]   I mean, Sarah uses it for--
[00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:08.900]   Totally red show.
[00:43:08.900 --> 00:43:09.700]   Totally red show.
[00:43:09.700 --> 00:43:10.940]   I'm going on and on and on.
[00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:11.980]   But think about this, though.
[00:43:11.980 --> 00:43:14.140]   Like, let's say, obviously, this is a weird experiment
[00:43:14.140 --> 00:43:16.060]   to crowdsource the total development of this site
[00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:16.420]   that we just--
[00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:17.300]   Which we have just done.
[00:43:17.300 --> 00:43:17.860]   Oh my god.
[00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:20.900]   Let's say somebody-- somebody read it, or digs it,
[00:43:20.900 --> 00:43:22.300]   gets super popular.
[00:43:22.300 --> 00:43:24.780]   And of course, obviously, you've got the popular Twit effect,
[00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:25.740]   where everyone goes there.
[00:43:25.740 --> 00:43:26.340]   They practice the beauty.
[00:43:26.340 --> 00:43:27.340]   Well, see, that's the beauty of this.
[00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:29.140]   You don't have to worry, because Squarespace
[00:43:29.140 --> 00:43:31.140]   has an amazing technology.
[00:43:31.140 --> 00:43:33.700]   The hosting technology in this is so powerful.
[00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:36.700]   They're using a very sophisticated Java virtual server.
[00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:39.580]   I want you to go in here and just take a look
[00:43:39.580 --> 00:43:41.700]   at what you could do with Squarespace.
[00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:44.620]   The great stats, the great templates, everything
[00:43:44.620 --> 00:43:45.820]   you've ever wanted.
[00:43:45.820 --> 00:43:47.220]   The blog importer is great.
[00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:48.420]   Now, they call it a blog importer,
[00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:51.700]   but many websites use the standard APIs from Blogger
[00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:55.820]   or Typepad or a Moveable Type of WordPress import and export.
[00:43:55.820 --> 00:43:57.100]   So you're never trapped.
[00:43:57.100 --> 00:43:58.180]   I like that philosophy.
[00:43:58.180 --> 00:44:00.140]   Great social widgets.
[00:44:00.140 --> 00:44:02.900]   Make sure you put Brian's unicorn Twitter handle
[00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:04.820]   and his Flickr account in there, OK?
[00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:07.900]   I'd like to see that totally become the new Wikipedia.
[00:44:07.900 --> 00:44:09.300]   Like, if you've got a look at it.
[00:44:09.300 --> 00:44:10.060]   You've got a look at it.
[00:44:10.060 --> 00:44:10.460]   All right.
[00:44:10.460 --> 00:44:11.020]   Should we do it?
[00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:13.020]   Yeah, go ahead and split it up now before it gets dirty.
[00:44:13.020 --> 00:44:15.580]   I just want to say Squarespace.com.
[00:44:15.580 --> 00:44:17.220]   Use the offer code TWIT7.
[00:44:17.220 --> 00:44:18.940]   And we've got a special deal.
[00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:21.380]   If you use the offer code TWIT7, I think you get--
[00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:23.820]   and it's not here, but what is the deal?
[00:44:23.820 --> 00:44:26.820]   Here, no, that's not it.
[00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:29.300]   I believe a TWIT7, if it's like the one that we--
[00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:31.460]   No, they change the offer and I don't have copy in here.
[00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:32.460]   But it's something great.
[00:44:32.460 --> 00:44:33.860]   All right, I'll find out what we--
[00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:37.060]   We can verify that it's a billion dollars cash in the bank
[00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:39.260]   if you use offer code TWIT7.
[00:44:39.260 --> 00:44:42.580]   Your website, TWIT rules, Brian is a unicorn,
[00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:45.100]   Schwood Rocks, crowdsourcing via TWIT.
[00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:45.980]   I want some pictures.
[00:44:45.980 --> 00:44:46.660]   Well, where are you?
[00:44:46.660 --> 00:44:48.780]   They've got it all down there.
[00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:50.260]   Oh, you're logged in is the problem.
[00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:51.140]   You got a log down.
[00:44:51.140 --> 00:44:52.700]   Oh, I'm not seeing the real thing.
[00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:53.140]   That's right.
[00:44:53.140 --> 00:44:53.580]   That's right.
[00:44:53.580 --> 00:44:56.820]   And if you go all the way down, there you go.
[00:44:56.820 --> 00:44:57.780]   I see that.
[00:44:57.780 --> 00:45:00.220]   And keep on going down.
[00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:02.620]   Crowdsource of you, there should be down at the bottom.
[00:45:02.620 --> 00:45:03.180]   No, no, no.
[00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:04.020]   Somebody's missed with it.
[00:45:04.020 --> 00:45:05.860]   Oh, they've already taken it away, because look at this.
[00:45:05.860 --> 00:45:06.620]   I got it right here.
[00:45:06.620 --> 00:45:08.900]   They actually have the unicorn right.
[00:45:08.900 --> 00:45:10.140]   The unicorn nyan in there.
[00:45:10.140 --> 00:45:12.100]   Oh, well.
[00:45:12.100 --> 00:45:14.340]   So let's get some-- a little more work,
[00:45:14.340 --> 00:45:16.260]   but they're doing that very quickly within these fast--
[00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:16.580]   It's fast.
[00:45:16.580 --> 00:45:17.420]   Commercial.
[00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:17.900]   It's fast.
[00:45:17.900 --> 00:45:19.300]   Hacked again is the top--
[00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:21.220]   Oh, they're going to loot too legit to TWIT right there.
[00:45:21.220 --> 00:45:21.940]   Take a look at it now.
[00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:22.740]   Refresh.
[00:45:22.740 --> 00:45:24.580]   They already have it in there.
[00:45:24.580 --> 00:45:25.980]   So what is the website of this?
[00:45:25.980 --> 00:45:29.620]   Brian is a unicorn at squarespace-- or dot squarespace.com.
[00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:33.700]   Somehow the NSFW show has leaked into--
[00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:35.500]   They're an active bunch.
[00:45:35.500 --> 00:45:36.420]   That crew.
[00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:39.940]   They are not shy about using the Squarespace tools.
[00:45:39.940 --> 00:45:41.340]   There we go.
[00:45:41.340 --> 00:45:42.780]   And it's even got music.
[00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:45.020]   Here, if you run all the way--
[00:45:45.020 --> 00:45:46.220]   We have just created the ultimate--
[00:45:46.220 --> 00:45:47.900]   There it is.
[00:45:47.900 --> 00:45:49.380]   This is our new Squarespace site.
[00:45:49.380 --> 00:45:51.700]   And you know what the beauty of this is?
[00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:53.820]   After the two week trial runs out,
[00:45:53.820 --> 00:45:56.820]   all they have to do is either the offer code TWIT7
[00:45:56.820 --> 00:45:58.900]   and this music will stop.
[00:45:58.900 --> 00:46:00.740]   And figure that what the offer is.
[00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:04.820]   The music will stop when you use the offer code TWIT7.
[00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:05.740]   Wow.
[00:46:05.740 --> 00:46:06.980]   No, I think the deal is.
[00:46:06.980 --> 00:46:09.980]   Thank you.
[00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:11.140]   Thank you.
[00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:12.140]   Oh my god.
[00:46:12.140 --> 00:46:14.180]   Oh my god.
[00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:16.060]   You get 10% off for six months.
[00:46:16.060 --> 00:46:16.620]   That's the deal.
[00:46:16.620 --> 00:46:17.660]   10% off for six months.
[00:46:17.660 --> 00:46:21.300]   squarespace.com offer code TWIT7.
[00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:27.260]   See you're the worst of the best commercial
[00:46:27.260 --> 00:46:28.100]   you've ever had in the year.
[00:46:28.100 --> 00:46:32.420]   This is the new Squarespace channel, I believe, actually.
[00:46:32.420 --> 00:46:33.660]   Wow.
[00:46:33.660 --> 00:46:34.140]   Wow.
[00:46:34.140 --> 00:46:35.220]   So that just happened.
[00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:39.300]   Let's talk a little bit more Google+, it kind of pales
[00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:41.300]   in comparison to Brian's unicorn.
[00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:43.020]   That's squarespace.com.
[00:46:43.020 --> 00:46:46.940]   If Google could iterate that fast, just imagine.
[00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:50.060]   So Google is Danny updating everything though, right?
[00:46:50.060 --> 00:46:51.740]   Calendar is going to be being updated.
[00:46:51.740 --> 00:46:54.980]   Gmail is being updated.
[00:46:54.980 --> 00:46:58.340]   There is a kind of something going on, isn't there?
[00:46:58.340 --> 00:47:01.140]   Well, and one nice thing that actually if you get to the
[00:47:01.140 --> 00:47:03.220]   integration would be, for example, if you're going into
[00:47:03.220 --> 00:47:05.140]   Google Doc and you want to share that Doc with your
[00:47:05.140 --> 00:47:07.060]   circles, how will you?
[00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:09.700]   Because every time I have to share a Doc with people, it's
[00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:12.300]   like constantly going back and I've created lists and it
[00:47:12.300 --> 00:47:14.660]   seemed to lose the list or never works.
[00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:17.220]   So that would be pretty awesome.
[00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:20.780]   And it was interesting to talk about moving stuff over to
[00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:24.380]   Picasso because that's kind of been this also ran, I feel
[00:47:24.380 --> 00:47:25.300]   like, the flicker.
[00:47:25.300 --> 00:47:27.620]   Oh, I mean, it suddenly changes everything, doesn't it?
[00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:31.860]   Yeah, and you've also had a whole rise of other photo
[00:47:31.860 --> 00:47:34.980]   sharing services like TWITPIC or whatever that have come along.
[00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:37.980]   And you wonder if they couldn't make Picasso more into a
[00:47:37.980 --> 00:47:41.500]   real time sharing service that you could also then upload
[00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:44.340]   through your Twitter account if you wanted to.
[00:47:44.340 --> 00:47:46.340]   But if you're also making more use of this, I mean, maybe
[00:47:46.340 --> 00:47:49.660]   this will bump it over, especially when I think there's
[00:47:49.660 --> 00:47:53.700]   still some uncertainty about what on earth goes on with
[00:47:53.700 --> 00:47:53.980]   the author.
[00:47:53.980 --> 00:47:55.700]   They do put up this notice, which is important.
[00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:58.700]   Albums you shared publicly can and turn be tagged and shared
[00:47:58.700 --> 00:47:59.580]   by others.
[00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:02.340]   So all of them, this kind of shocked me all of a sudden
[00:48:02.340 --> 00:48:04.980]   three-year-old pictures are showing up in my--
[00:48:04.980 --> 00:48:07.340]   looked like showing up in my stream on Google+.
[00:48:07.340 --> 00:48:10.540]   And it's weird if you watch--
[00:48:10.540 --> 00:48:12.940]   you're following Sergey Brin or Larry Page.
[00:48:12.940 --> 00:48:13.300]   Yeah.
[00:48:13.300 --> 00:48:16.860]   They look like every day they're skydiving or jumping off
[00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:22.340]   a place or a pipe stripping the Mekong Delta or something.
[00:48:22.340 --> 00:48:22.900]   I mean--
[00:48:22.900 --> 00:48:26.740]   It's all their old shots are kind of now showing up.
[00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:28.540]   I'm sure that will calm down in a bit.
[00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:31.300]   Now, we've focused a lot on Google+, and Facebook, but
[00:48:31.300 --> 00:48:34.700]   isn't Twitter really the potential big victim here?
[00:48:34.700 --> 00:48:37.700]   I mean, this is a Twitter replacement, and that's the
[00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:39.100]   same, roughly the same.
[00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:40.700]   I don't know about that yet.
[00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:41.340]   You don't think so?
[00:48:41.340 --> 00:48:44.140]   Well, mainly because the way I read Twitter--
[00:48:44.140 --> 00:48:47.660]   and I don't know if it's just me, but I use the TweetDeck app,
[00:48:47.660 --> 00:48:50.420]   and I get this flashpoint where I see all the text, all
[00:48:50.420 --> 00:48:51.420]   these different people.
[00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:53.700]   It's as though you're looking in and you're getting a snapshot
[00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:56.300]   of a nationwide public conversation and you're hearing
[00:48:56.300 --> 00:48:57.980]   everyone you want at once.
[00:48:57.980 --> 00:49:00.100]   There's something about the efficiency of that, seeing
[00:49:00.100 --> 00:49:03.300]   this many very short posts all at once.
[00:49:03.300 --> 00:49:05.260]   Remember, the whole reason Twitter took off is because
[00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:06.860]   it's only 140 characters.
[00:49:06.860 --> 00:49:08.660]   And when you take that away, you lose something.
[00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:09.460]   And that's why--
[00:49:09.460 --> 00:49:11.220]   and again, I'm not saying that it's a bad thing for Google
[00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:12.940]  +, but it's going to be a different thing, and it makes
[00:49:12.940 --> 00:49:15.300]   me think that Twitter probably has less to worry about
[00:49:15.300 --> 00:49:15.620]   them facing more class.
[00:49:15.620 --> 00:49:16.540]   You guys agree, Neilan?
[00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:17.540]   Neilan, do you agree?
[00:49:17.540 --> 00:49:18.820]   Yeah, I completely agree.
[00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:21.340]   I mean, I think the greatest thing about Twitter is that
[00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:23.380]   you can just pick it up and figure out how to use it
[00:49:23.380 --> 00:49:24.460]   instantly.
[00:49:24.460 --> 00:49:25.380]   There's no--
[00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:28.420]   you don't have to worry about privacy, because by
[00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:30.300]   default, the whole point is to publish everything with
[00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:31.100]   everyone.
[00:49:31.100 --> 00:49:32.500]   And people understand it.
[00:49:32.500 --> 00:49:35.220]   That's not true about Google+, you're right.
[00:49:35.220 --> 00:49:35.780]   Right.
[00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:38.100]   And I think that is going to be--
[00:49:38.100 --> 00:49:41.060]   look, I'm happy that Google is not competing with Facebook
[00:49:41.060 --> 00:49:44.380]   on the very specific vector of let's make privacy easy for
[00:49:44.380 --> 00:49:45.900]   normal humans to figure out.
[00:49:45.900 --> 00:49:47.500]   Because Facebook's way behind in that.
[00:49:47.500 --> 00:49:51.860]   I don't know that Google's answer is better, but Twitter
[00:49:51.860 --> 00:49:54.340]   was never that competitor with Facebook.
[00:49:54.340 --> 00:49:55.180]   Because they were just--
[00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:56.140]   They were just trying to be right.
[00:49:56.140 --> 00:49:58.820]   Buzz wanted to be that competitor, and it failed.
[00:49:58.820 --> 00:49:59.340]   Right.
[00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:00.980]   But Buzz was directed at Twitter.
[00:50:00.980 --> 00:50:03.620]   I meant, we always talk about the social networking
[00:50:03.620 --> 00:50:05.860]   competition between Twitter and Facebook.
[00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:08.380]   But Twitter never had to care about privacy.
[00:50:08.380 --> 00:50:10.820]   They're not built around any notion of privacy.
[00:50:10.820 --> 00:50:12.860]   That turned out to be a huge advantage, didn't it?
[00:50:12.860 --> 00:50:14.460]   Yeah, it's huge, because everybody gets it.
[00:50:14.460 --> 00:50:16.060]   They're like, I'm going to type this, and everyone will see it.
[00:50:16.060 --> 00:50:17.820]   I can follow all these famous people who are telling me what
[00:50:17.820 --> 00:50:18.860]   they want to see.
[00:50:18.860 --> 00:50:22.860]   Facebook has not had competition in the privacy space at all,
[00:50:22.860 --> 00:50:23.820]   really.
[00:50:23.820 --> 00:50:25.980]   I think that's Google+, I think one of the big things
[00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:28.020]   we're going to see out of it is now, finally, these two
[00:50:28.020 --> 00:50:30.100]   companies, they're going to have to iterate on privacy
[00:50:30.100 --> 00:50:31.260]   in a real way.
[00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:34.140]   I don't think Twitter has to worry about it, because they're
[00:50:34.140 --> 00:50:35.460]   doing something different.
[00:50:35.460 --> 00:50:38.700]   It's exactly like you're saying.
[00:50:38.700 --> 00:50:41.940]   It's so easy to understand and use and get a snapshot of what's
[00:50:41.940 --> 00:50:43.060]   happening right now.
[00:50:43.060 --> 00:50:44.940]   You can just look at it, and you can walk away.
[00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:46.980]   And then you go and interact with Facebook in a way
[00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:48.940]   that you don't interact with Twitter.
[00:50:48.940 --> 00:50:52.380]   I think you've also got some advantages that both Facebook
[00:50:52.380 --> 00:50:55.940]   and Twitter have in terms of what they're doing with the brands.
[00:50:55.940 --> 00:51:00.620]   It's not a plus rolled out without any concept of a brand
[00:51:00.620 --> 00:51:02.820]   has a page and acts on its own.
[00:51:02.820 --> 00:51:05.140]   And I know that they've said that that's going to come along
[00:51:05.140 --> 00:51:07.460]   and they're going to get to it, and we'll have it at some point.
[00:51:07.460 --> 00:51:12.420]   But I was dumbfounded it wasn't there at launch, because they
[00:51:12.420 --> 00:51:14.100]   already had that problem with buzz.
[00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:15.580]   Then they go back to the drawing board.
[00:51:15.580 --> 00:51:17.420]   They start over, and they know that they're going to have
[00:51:17.420 --> 00:51:18.940]   to have that sort of thing.
[00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:21.820]   Meanwhile, if you look at one of the appeals of both Facebook
[00:51:21.820 --> 00:51:23.940]   and Twitter, it's the fact that you can actually follow brands
[00:51:23.940 --> 00:51:26.100]   and keep up with them and interact with them.
[00:51:26.100 --> 00:51:27.540]   So that's all got to come.
[00:51:27.540 --> 00:51:32.820]   And I don't think that these other brands that are already
[00:51:32.820 --> 00:51:36.540]   out on Facebook or Twitter, that just gets tossed to the side.
[00:51:36.540 --> 00:51:38.780]   I think you're going to have significant numbers of people
[00:51:38.780 --> 00:51:42.300]   there as well, so you continue to maintain those sorts of things.
[00:51:42.300 --> 00:51:45.860]   Maybe if Facebook or Twitter should go all my space wise
[00:51:45.860 --> 00:51:48.220]   and decline, then you kind of let those sort of things go.
[00:51:48.220 --> 00:51:50.980]   But I think they're both barely strong in that regard.
[00:51:50.980 --> 00:51:52.780]   And this is an area where Google+ really
[00:51:52.780 --> 00:51:56.060]   have to play a lot of ketchup, and they're not even playing it yet,
[00:51:56.060 --> 00:51:57.740]   because they don't even have that concept.
[00:51:57.740 --> 00:51:58.220]   Right.
[00:51:58.220 --> 00:51:59.340]   Well, you know, because ideally the way
[00:51:59.340 --> 00:52:00.940]   that you interact with the brand through Google,
[00:52:00.940 --> 00:52:04.100]   you search the brand's own page, and then you go to the brand.
[00:52:04.100 --> 00:52:08.420]   I mean, Google+, I think, represents one of the very few
[00:52:08.420 --> 00:52:12.060]   places within the Google ecosystem where you interact with Google
[00:52:12.060 --> 00:52:12.580]   itself.
[00:52:12.580 --> 00:52:15.100]   I think the most notable thus far has been YouTube.
[00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:16.340]   But even that isn't--
[00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:18.900]   I don't think people think of YouTube as being Google.
[00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:22.060]   It's this whole separate entity with its own conventions
[00:52:22.060 --> 00:52:23.740]   and communities and rules.
[00:52:23.740 --> 00:52:25.860]   Google+ is like, you're in Google.
[00:52:25.860 --> 00:52:27.740]   You're using this Google product.
[00:52:27.740 --> 00:52:31.180]   And I can't think of very many that are hugely popular.
[00:52:31.180 --> 00:52:32.780]   There's YouTube and there's Gmail.
[00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:35.500]   And then search is all about taking you away from Google.
[00:52:35.500 --> 00:52:36.580]   That's a good point.
[00:52:36.580 --> 00:52:39.620]   So they've really got to figure out how that works for them.
[00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:40.940]   And I think they'll be some growing.
[00:52:40.940 --> 00:52:42.260]   I don't doubt that they will.
[00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:44.060]   It'll just be interesting to see how they answer
[00:52:44.060 --> 00:52:45.660]   some of these outstanding questions.
[00:52:45.660 --> 00:52:51.060]   Is Twitter in trouble, Biz Stone, Evan Williams,
[00:52:51.060 --> 00:52:54.060]   relaunching obvious?
[00:52:54.060 --> 00:52:56.620]   That's a little strange, actually.
[00:52:56.620 --> 00:52:59.860]   I guess Costello's been left in charge of--
[00:52:59.860 --> 00:53:02.140]   As strange as having Jack Dorsey apparently running two
[00:53:02.140 --> 00:53:02.940]   different products.
[00:53:02.940 --> 00:53:03.900]   And I'm going to--
[00:53:03.900 --> 00:53:04.780]   Dorsey's back.
[00:53:04.780 --> 00:53:09.820]   He's both doing Twitter and Square, his own startup.
[00:53:09.820 --> 00:53:12.980]   It feels like Twitter's kind of stumbling or struggling.
[00:53:12.980 --> 00:53:16.020]   There's a difference up in this hypergrowth world where we
[00:53:16.020 --> 00:53:18.020]   keep expecting everything to take over the world.
[00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:19.980]   And we're surprised when something levels off.
[00:53:19.980 --> 00:53:22.860]   I mean, if Twitter were to level off where it is,
[00:53:22.860 --> 00:53:25.500]   I'm not going to call that a stumble or a fall, I'm going to say.
[00:53:25.500 --> 00:53:26.100]   Not so bad.
[00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:29.140]   But we've seen companies like Dig level off.
[00:53:29.140 --> 00:53:30.860]   And it's not so good.
[00:53:30.860 --> 00:53:31.220]   Yeah.
[00:53:31.220 --> 00:53:35.540]   Not just level off a plunge off a cliff dying.
[00:53:35.540 --> 00:53:37.580]   They still have a good number of uniques.
[00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:38.940]   It's not like they're disappeared.
[00:53:38.940 --> 00:53:40.180]   But it is-- it's funny.
[00:53:40.180 --> 00:53:42.380]   Perception-- there's a lot to perception in all.
[00:53:42.380 --> 00:53:44.380]   Well, and especially when later we talk about the Apple
[00:53:44.380 --> 00:53:48.180]   story coming up, it's just we're obsessed with constant growth.
[00:53:48.180 --> 00:53:50.420]   And of course, that's not necessarily sustainable.
[00:53:50.420 --> 00:53:54.300]   And at some point, for example, just a while ago,
[00:53:54.300 --> 00:53:56.860]   we were talking about how Facebook is, for the first time
[00:53:56.860 --> 00:53:58.900]   ever, lost users in a month or whatever.
[00:53:58.900 --> 00:54:00.740]   When we act like this is the end of the world, it's like, look,
[00:54:00.740 --> 00:54:02.780]   they still have 750 million people on this thing.
[00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:05.180]   Twitter 200 million tweets a day.
[00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:05.660]   Yeah.
[00:54:05.660 --> 00:54:06.500]   That's a lot of tweets.
[00:54:06.500 --> 00:54:08.620]   You know, I think the interesting about Twitter is the way
[00:54:08.620 --> 00:54:11.660]   I think people perceive it is that it's just part of the internet.
[00:54:11.660 --> 00:54:13.380]   I think they feel that way about Facebook, too.
[00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:14.980]   And to a large extent, Google search.
[00:54:14.980 --> 00:54:16.660]   And actually, that's the thing that bothers me,
[00:54:16.660 --> 00:54:17.900]   because it isn't part of the internet.
[00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:19.980]   It's a privately held company.
[00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:20.580]   Right.
[00:54:20.580 --> 00:54:23.300]   But I think that's why it always feels like Twitter's in trouble.
[00:54:23.300 --> 00:54:26.820]   Because I think our instinct is that something that feels so
[00:54:26.820 --> 00:54:31.060]   natural and ingrained should be so easy to run and monetize and grow.
[00:54:31.060 --> 00:54:31.820]   But it's not.
[00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:33.660]   I don't actually-- I still kind of don't
[00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:36.260]   know how Twitter plans to make money forever, right?
[00:54:36.260 --> 00:54:39.380]   Selling ads and premium tweets or whatever they're doing,
[00:54:39.380 --> 00:54:41.860]   that all feels like, well, crap.
[00:54:41.860 --> 00:54:43.940]   Here's the first idea we had.
[00:54:43.940 --> 00:54:46.540]   It's not that here's the big idea of how we make money with this.
[00:54:46.540 --> 00:54:48.940]   And I think that's why they're in trouble.
[00:54:48.940 --> 00:54:51.260]   I think they had the vision of what the product could be.
[00:54:51.260 --> 00:54:54.260]   And they lacked the equally important vision of how they actually
[00:54:54.260 --> 00:54:56.020]   make money making that product.
[00:54:56.020 --> 00:54:57.900]   And who knows how they're going to solve that problem?
[00:54:57.900 --> 00:55:01.260]   Because if I knew the answer, I'd be knocking at the store right now.
[00:55:01.260 --> 00:55:02.020]   They'd be here.
[00:55:02.020 --> 00:55:04.260]   It's literally that same state of trouble, though.
[00:55:04.260 --> 00:55:06.700]   When they launched, it was like, well, what is this going to be?
[00:55:06.700 --> 00:55:08.140]   How this is growing too fast?
[00:55:08.140 --> 00:55:08.620]   Servers can't get--
[00:55:08.620 --> 00:55:11.380]   Yeah, but you can disguise the trouble with success, right?
[00:55:11.380 --> 00:55:12.740]   You're like, check out all these celebrities.
[00:55:12.740 --> 00:55:15.100]   Don't mind this other problem that we had.
[00:55:15.100 --> 00:55:16.420]   And they can't do that anymore.
[00:55:16.420 --> 00:55:19.540]   It's like it's a part of the fabric of the internet now.
[00:55:19.540 --> 00:55:24.100]   I strongly suspect that there will be some way to monetize and make it work out,
[00:55:24.100 --> 00:55:28.060]   if for no other reason, because Twitter may, in fact, after the internet,
[00:55:28.060 --> 00:55:31.580]   be one of the most significant advances in my lifetime.
[00:55:31.580 --> 00:55:34.260]   And what I mean by that is not from the next few years or whatever,
[00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:39.620]   but what I mean is 1,000 years from now, we will have, with shocking fidelity,
[00:55:39.620 --> 00:55:43.340]   a diary that the entire world kept for a very short amount of time.
[00:55:43.340 --> 00:55:44.620]   Or maybe on-term, maybe on-term.
[00:55:44.620 --> 00:55:45.140]   Oh, OK.
[00:55:45.140 --> 00:55:46.300]   The entire world?
[00:55:46.300 --> 00:55:46.940]   Well, OK.
[00:55:46.940 --> 00:55:48.740]   Well, I mean, certainly, certainly--
[00:55:48.740 --> 00:55:50.260]   And you can't search it.
[00:55:50.260 --> 00:55:51.540]   I can't search it.
[00:55:51.540 --> 00:55:52.860]   Well, no, no, no, you can't search it.
[00:55:52.860 --> 00:55:53.580]   Yeah, of course you can.
[00:55:53.580 --> 00:55:55.220]   And on Twitter, you can search it on Google.
[00:55:55.220 --> 00:55:55.780]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:55:55.780 --> 00:55:58.340]   And of course, of course, they're backing everything up at the Library of Congress.
[00:55:58.340 --> 00:56:01.420]   I mean, look, I'm talking about from an archaeological perspective.
[00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:05.260]   This is-- imagine if you could go back to any of history's greatest events
[00:56:05.260 --> 00:56:10.580]   and get this level of precise on-the-ground account of what happened
[00:56:10.580 --> 00:56:12.900]   and what it meant to the people doing it.
[00:56:12.900 --> 00:56:17.660]   This is a picture of our whole life for the last few years happening.
[00:56:17.660 --> 00:56:20.100]   And that is precious, and it is special.
[00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:24.260]   And there's got to be a way to monetize it, to make it keep on going.
[00:56:24.260 --> 00:56:27.740]   Twitter, under investigation with the Federal Trade Commission.
[00:56:27.740 --> 00:56:29.340]   Unless the government shuts it down.
[00:56:29.340 --> 00:56:30.420]   Yeah, there's that.
[00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:32.780]   And of course, Google is also under investigation.
[00:56:32.780 --> 00:56:34.700]   Google for antitrust.
[00:56:34.700 --> 00:56:39.900]   Twitter, the FTC, according to Business Insider Nicholas Carlson and Dan Frommer,
[00:56:39.900 --> 00:56:44.700]   is investigating Twitter for the way it deals with companies building applications and services.
[00:56:44.700 --> 00:56:48.460]   In other words, when Twitter kind of undermined the 30-party apps
[00:56:48.460 --> 00:56:51.420]   and undermined the photo sharing and undermined the URL shortening
[00:56:51.420 --> 00:57:00.940]   and undermined the other Twitter symbionts, despite encouraging them in the beginning,
[00:57:00.940 --> 00:57:04.140]   the FTC says, you shouldn't be doing that.
[00:57:04.140 --> 00:57:08.660]   I think the one thing I do does kind of bother me is what they did with TweetTech,
[00:57:08.660 --> 00:57:16.300]   where Bill Gross wanted to-- what was the name of it?
[00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:18.220]   Uber-- Uber Twitter.
[00:57:18.220 --> 00:57:19.220]   Uber Twitter.
[00:57:19.220 --> 00:57:19.980]   Uber, me there.
[00:57:19.980 --> 00:57:20.820]   Uber, me there.
[00:57:20.820 --> 00:57:21.820]   That's it.
[00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:25.620]   Started buying up Twitter clients and even said, I'm going to do a Twitter competitor.
[00:57:25.620 --> 00:57:31.140]   And then at that point, Twitter said, whoa, and stole TweetTech from them by doubling the value.
[00:57:31.140 --> 00:57:32.540]   Now, that's just business as usual.
[00:57:32.540 --> 00:57:34.460]   It's kind of sharky.
[00:57:34.460 --> 00:57:36.780]   Well, but this is a problem with building a platform, right?
[00:57:36.780 --> 00:57:40.900]   Is that you've got to do right by the people that rely on your platform.
[00:57:40.900 --> 00:57:47.260]   And this is like-- the FTC is involved because it's sort of a collective action problem, right?
[00:57:47.260 --> 00:57:50.660]   You can't have this company that's affecting the economy with all these other companies
[00:57:50.660 --> 00:57:52.340]   feeding into it and then going in and--
[00:57:52.340 --> 00:57:54.860]   And then they pull the rug out from under everybody.
[00:57:54.860 --> 00:57:55.340]   Right.
[00:57:55.340 --> 00:57:59.140]   But I think this goes back to that core issue of how does Twitter make money, right?
[00:57:59.140 --> 00:58:01.220]   And you look at all these other companies, you know,
[00:58:01.220 --> 00:58:03.220]   TweetTech figured out how to make money on Twitter.
[00:58:03.220 --> 00:58:03.740]   Right.
[00:58:03.740 --> 00:58:05.300]   Like, put your photos on our service.
[00:58:05.300 --> 00:58:06.100]   We'll run some ads.
[00:58:06.100 --> 00:58:06.980]   There we go.
[00:58:06.980 --> 00:58:08.380]   And Twitter is like, well, crap.
[00:58:08.380 --> 00:58:09.660]   Like, we have to do that, too.
[00:58:09.660 --> 00:58:13.580]   And I think that's where they're starting to pull in all of these ancillary products
[00:58:13.580 --> 00:58:17.300]   around the core TweetStream that are easy to monetize.
[00:58:17.300 --> 00:58:21.580]   Whereas I think the core TweetStream will always be sort of hard for them to make money off.
[00:58:21.580 --> 00:58:26.260]   So I reiterate my initial point, which isn't Twitter kind of in trouble.
[00:58:26.260 --> 00:58:28.820]   But I think it's the same level of trouble that they've always been.
[00:58:28.820 --> 00:58:29.700]   No, I guess--
[00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:31.060]   That's a good way to put it, actually.
[00:58:31.060 --> 00:58:32.820]   I think that's a good way to put it in perspective.
[00:58:32.820 --> 00:58:33.500]   Yeah, they're in trouble.
[00:58:33.500 --> 00:58:34.860]   It's the same trouble they've had forever.
[00:58:34.860 --> 00:58:35.380]   Right.
[00:58:35.380 --> 00:58:36.780]   Like, who's in charge?
[00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:38.100]   Nobody knows.
[00:58:38.100 --> 00:58:38.900]   How do we have money?
[00:58:38.900 --> 00:58:39.580]   Nobody knows.
[00:58:39.580 --> 00:58:42.340]   We should probably find a guy to be in charge who knows the answer to that question.
[00:58:42.340 --> 00:58:44.980]   Let's try this guy, because the other three guys don't work out.
[00:58:44.980 --> 00:58:47.540]   Like, so they're going to be in that level of trouble until they--
[00:58:47.540 --> 00:58:48.900]   But then let me ask you guys to ask.
[00:58:48.900 --> 00:58:54.100]   Let me ask you that they're going to be stronger by getting rid of the people who
[00:58:54.100 --> 00:58:56.900]   don't know how to monetize it but knew how to build a good system.
[00:58:56.900 --> 00:58:59.980]   And in fact, I think that some of them have said that sort of thing.
[00:58:59.980 --> 00:59:01.300]   Like, you know, we're great.
[00:59:01.300 --> 00:59:03.260]   We love that we built this sort of thing up.
[00:59:03.260 --> 00:59:06.220]   So perhaps we're not the right people to then take it forward to the next level.
[00:59:06.220 --> 00:59:07.380]   It needs to go.
[00:59:07.380 --> 00:59:10.740]   You know, there's also the argument that when you lose your founders, that sometimes you
[00:59:10.740 --> 00:59:14.460]   lose the thing that makes the product compelling in the--
[00:59:14.460 --> 00:59:15.780]   The heart of ways.
[00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:18.060]   But I mean, that can go either way.
[00:59:18.060 --> 00:59:19.500]   It can go either way.
[00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:24.500]   So let me ask you guys, would anybody quit their Twitter account if they announced,
[00:59:24.500 --> 00:59:26.140]   listen, we got to make some money.
[00:59:26.140 --> 00:59:27.100]   Here's the deal.
[00:59:27.100 --> 00:59:32.740]   Once a day in the middle of the average, you know, 3,000 to 1,000 tweets that you receive,
[00:59:32.740 --> 00:59:35.580]   one of them will be a paid advertisement once per day.
[00:59:35.580 --> 00:59:38.940]   And once per month, you'll get a text message on your phone.
[00:59:38.940 --> 00:59:40.980]   It'll be a direct message to live with that.
[00:59:40.980 --> 00:59:42.900]   I mean, I think they can make a ton of money.
[00:59:42.900 --> 00:59:44.740]   But in my Twitter stream, I'll never catch it.
[00:59:44.740 --> 00:59:45.740]   Well, I know.
[00:59:45.740 --> 00:59:46.740]   And they know that too.
[00:59:46.740 --> 00:59:51.700]   But when you got 200 million people and you could guarantee impressions for 100,000 of
[00:59:51.700 --> 00:59:55.420]   them in any given day, you know, I think-- and especially if that's every single day
[00:59:55.420 --> 00:59:58.180]   and these are premium slots that they're selling for 50 grand per day.
[00:59:58.180 --> 01:00:02.100]   If a nunnic like you could figure that out, what's keeping Twitter for figuring that out?
[01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:03.100]   I don't know.
[01:00:03.100 --> 01:00:04.100]   Nobody wants to buy it.
[01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:05.540]   That's what's keeping it ever figuring out.
[01:00:05.540 --> 01:00:06.540]   Nobody wants to buy those ads?
[01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:09.460]   For those numbers, you've got however many million people a day and 100,000 impressions
[01:00:09.460 --> 01:00:10.460]   guaranteed.
[01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:11.460]   It's like chum change.
[01:00:11.460 --> 01:00:12.460]   It's like a billboard.
[01:00:12.460 --> 01:00:13.460]   That's good luck.
[01:00:13.460 --> 01:00:14.700]   Now, the people would buy the ads.
[01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:18.580]   I think the reason they don't do it is because they don't particularly have to do it yet.
[01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:19.580]   Right.
[01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:20.580]   They've got enough money.
[01:00:20.580 --> 01:00:24.260]   They don't have as much pressure to start monetizing all the stuff that they do.
[01:00:24.260 --> 01:00:26.540]   And, you know, they seem to be very cautious.
[01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:27.540]   And they did.
[01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:30.820]   They had a very bad experience with the Twitter bar or whatever it was that they had done with
[01:00:30.820 --> 01:00:31.820]   it.
[01:00:31.820 --> 01:00:32.820]   Yeah, I think people would buy those.
[01:00:32.820 --> 01:00:33.820]   Do you think this is-
[01:00:33.820 --> 01:00:34.820]   Do you think this is-
[01:00:34.820 --> 01:00:37.140]   They're buying the promoted tweets and they're buying the promoted trends.
[01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:41.900]   Do you think this is kind of like Justin TV and Ustream.tv trying as hard as they can
[01:00:41.900 --> 01:00:45.100]   as long as they can to put off pre-roll knowing that everybody will hate it.
[01:00:45.100 --> 01:00:47.180]   But at some point they got to pay their bills.
[01:00:47.180 --> 01:00:50.800]   And maybe Twitter just isn't in that moment where they actually need to start collecting
[01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:51.800]   a paycheck on it.
[01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:53.060]   Yeah, a little bit.
[01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:57.380]   And then it's interesting also that with this plus, if you go back to the plus launch, it
[01:00:57.380 --> 01:01:02.660]   changes kind of like Dynamics too because arguably it puts Twitter in a weaker position
[01:01:02.660 --> 01:01:06.740]   because wow, people do use this and they do roll out a nap.
[01:01:06.740 --> 01:01:09.180]   And you can do these kinds of tweets and longer things or whatever.
[01:01:09.180 --> 01:01:10.820]   Will that kind of pick up?
[01:01:10.820 --> 01:01:14.900]   And I think it's also interesting, you know, we haven't talked about what this potentially
[01:01:14.900 --> 01:01:16.980]   does to 4 Square.
[01:01:16.980 --> 01:01:21.620]   But when you check in on Google+, it's much better than when you were checking in on latitude.
[01:01:21.620 --> 01:01:26.180]   And there's an ability to add your, you know, your check-in isn't just sort of checking
[01:01:26.180 --> 01:01:27.180]   in.
[01:01:27.180 --> 01:01:31.620]   It's, I can do the tweet that kind of goes with it and I can do the photos that go with it.
[01:01:31.620 --> 01:01:34.180]   And this is stuff that you can do with 4 Square as well.
[01:01:34.180 --> 01:01:36.940]   But potentially you're putting that out to bigger audience.
[01:01:36.940 --> 01:01:39.980]   You don't get the game mechanics, but then maybe you don't necessarily need the game
[01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:40.980]   mechanics.
[01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:43.100]   How, wait a minute, how do you check in on Google+, I don't know.
[01:01:43.100 --> 01:01:48.940]   If you're on the Android app, you click on the little, I think it's a check mark button.
[01:01:48.940 --> 01:01:49.940]   It's there.
[01:01:49.940 --> 01:01:50.940]   You can also do it on the web.
[01:01:50.940 --> 01:01:54.860]   You've got, that's what that little, that little place mark point is that that comes up
[01:01:54.860 --> 01:01:55.860]   there.
[01:01:55.860 --> 01:01:59.140]   And I've done a number of check-ins that way and it's, it's really nice.
[01:01:59.140 --> 01:02:00.140]   It's the little pencil.
[01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:01.140]   It's kind of, no, it's the little check.
[01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:02.140]   The check mark.
[01:02:02.140 --> 01:02:03.140]   I see the check.
[01:02:03.140 --> 01:02:04.140]   Very intuitive.
[01:02:04.140 --> 01:02:05.140]   The check.
[01:02:05.140 --> 01:02:06.140]   And it says choose your location.
[01:02:06.140 --> 01:02:07.140]   All right.
[01:02:07.140 --> 01:02:08.140]   So far the iPhone version works just fine too.
[01:02:08.140 --> 01:02:10.180]   It's got the same check.
[01:02:10.180 --> 01:02:15.060]   Did anybody else notice the, the relaunch of using the web interface on your iPhone as
[01:02:15.060 --> 01:02:16.460]   far as the, for everybody?
[01:02:16.460 --> 01:02:17.460]   Yeah, so annoying.
[01:02:17.460 --> 01:02:18.860]   Oh, you don't like it?
[01:02:18.860 --> 01:02:21.620]   I love it because I'm always jumping over from, because yeah, because you know what I
[01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:25.460]   really want to do when I'm looking at Gmail, my iPhone is look at Buzz by accident.
[01:02:25.460 --> 01:02:28.540]   It seems like the best idea.
[01:02:28.540 --> 01:02:30.740]   Oh my God, I can't believe I'm looking at Buzz Maps.
[01:02:30.740 --> 01:02:33.220]   No, I mean specifically being able to like in the upper right-hand corner, they get a
[01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:36.780]   more button and you press it and it drops down and it's like, it's an iPhone home screen
[01:02:36.780 --> 01:02:39.380]   like interface that gets me over to docs or to maps.
[01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:43.060]   I mean, I wouldn't use the maps through the web interface, but certainly I jumped over
[01:02:43.060 --> 01:02:44.060]   to docs.
[01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:46.140]   All these products that are better as native apps.
[01:02:46.140 --> 01:02:47.820]   But unfortunately they're not available.
[01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:50.180]   There is no Google Doc, iOS app, right?
[01:02:50.180 --> 01:02:53.780]   And there's no, there's no, there's no plus iOS app yet.
[01:02:53.780 --> 01:02:56.540]   So the plus app all over their site, they're saying coming soon.
[01:02:56.540 --> 01:02:57.740]   I have no idea what that means.
[01:02:57.740 --> 01:02:59.380]   But well, from what I understand, it's already been.
[01:02:59.380 --> 01:03:04.660]   I like about the way Google does these things is they are so interested in making sure that
[01:03:04.660 --> 01:03:07.380]   they're platform agnostic in a very real way.
[01:03:07.380 --> 01:03:11.420]   They're a company who really has a vested interest in making sure Android has the best
[01:03:11.420 --> 01:03:15.660]   possible stuff, yet they're still spending time making sure to support either via web
[01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:19.780]   now, apps later, whatever, they're willing to support that overall ecosystem.
[01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:21.340]   That's a, that's a strong thing.
[01:03:21.340 --> 01:03:23.180]   And for the future above my opinion.
[01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:26.580]   From what I understand, they've already submitted the app and they're waiting on Apple to approve
[01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:27.580]   it.
[01:03:27.580 --> 01:03:28.580]   But that's, that's your city.
[01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:30.660]   I'm sure they didn't submit it until they launched, right?
[01:03:30.660 --> 01:03:31.660]   I mean, right.
[01:03:31.660 --> 01:03:33.380]   I don't think you want to give Apple that tip off.
[01:03:33.380 --> 01:03:35.580]   So I doubt that the list was in the box.
[01:03:35.580 --> 01:03:37.420]   So it'll come out in a few days.
[01:03:37.420 --> 01:03:38.420]   Yeah.
[01:03:38.420 --> 01:03:39.860]   So Leo, I got to actually go in a few minutes.
[01:03:39.860 --> 01:03:42.420]   You want to skip ahead to this patent stuff so I can.
[01:03:42.420 --> 01:03:44.220]   Would you get to the good stuff?
[01:03:44.220 --> 01:03:45.220]   Yeah.
[01:03:45.220 --> 01:03:47.020]   I know you don't want to talk about it.
[01:03:47.020 --> 01:03:48.020]   And it's the next stuff.
[01:03:48.020 --> 01:03:49.020]   No new stuff.
[01:03:49.020 --> 01:03:51.260]   It goes straight to taking care of business.
[01:03:51.260 --> 01:03:53.540]   Nobody tell you that this is a four hour show.
[01:03:53.540 --> 01:03:55.140]   I thought that that was pretty clear.
[01:03:55.140 --> 01:03:56.140]   Okay.
[01:03:56.140 --> 01:03:57.140]   Skip to the work.
[01:03:57.140 --> 01:03:58.140]   I have to go see Transformers.
[01:03:58.140 --> 01:04:00.140]   Surely you understand my dilemma.
[01:04:00.140 --> 01:04:01.140]   Oh, yeah.
[01:04:01.140 --> 01:04:02.140]   I'm going to go off.
[01:04:02.140 --> 01:04:03.140]   Oh, yeah.
[01:04:03.140 --> 01:04:04.140]   All right.
[01:04:04.140 --> 01:04:05.140]   All right.
[01:04:05.140 --> 01:04:06.140]   So we're going to, you go to the eight o'clock show.
[01:04:06.140 --> 01:04:07.140]   Is that the deal?
[01:04:07.140 --> 01:04:08.820]   Now we're going, we're going to the nine.
[01:04:08.820 --> 01:04:10.140]   We're going to get in line by eight, fifteen.
[01:04:10.140 --> 01:04:11.380]   Oh, you got to get in line.
[01:04:11.380 --> 01:04:12.380]   Okay.
[01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:13.380]   Yeah.
[01:04:13.380 --> 01:04:14.380]   Wow.
[01:04:14.380 --> 01:04:15.380]   It's New York City, man.
[01:04:15.380 --> 01:04:16.380]   That's commitment.
[01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:17.380]   All right.
[01:04:17.380 --> 01:04:18.380]   Yeah.
[01:04:18.380 --> 01:04:19.380]   We're going to take a break.
[01:04:19.380 --> 01:04:20.380]   We're going to come back with Apple and Samsung.
[01:04:20.380 --> 01:04:21.380]   Sure.
[01:04:21.380 --> 01:04:23.620]   I mean, I just see the next thing is called patents.
[01:04:23.620 --> 01:04:25.980]   And I feel like if I leave and then you talk about patents, it'll be sad.
[01:04:25.980 --> 01:04:27.420]   Oh, we got, we got to talk about Nortell.
[01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:28.420]   We got to talk about the Apple.
[01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:29.420]   And there's Apple, Samsung.
[01:04:29.420 --> 01:04:31.660]   Yeah, there's actually quite a bit to talk about.
[01:04:31.660 --> 01:04:33.740]   So we will do that in just a second.
[01:04:33.740 --> 01:04:34.740]   But don't go anywhere.
[01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:35.940]   Neil I Patel is here.
[01:04:35.940 --> 01:04:36.940]   His website.
[01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:39.660]   What is the hell going on for my next thing?
[01:04:39.660 --> 01:04:40.660]   Dot.
[01:04:40.660 --> 01:04:41.660]   Squarespace.org.
[01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:42.660]   Squarespace.org.
[01:04:42.660 --> 01:04:44.060]   Brian is a unicorn.
[01:04:44.060 --> 01:04:45.060]   No.
[01:04:45.060 --> 01:04:47.380]   His website is what it.
[01:04:47.380 --> 01:04:50.300]   This is my next dot com, but it's, you said you're going to have an announcement soon.
[01:04:50.300 --> 01:04:54.820]   Yeah, sometime in the next few weeks, I think some, there's, there's stuff to be said.
[01:04:54.820 --> 01:04:58.420]   Some exciting developments that occurred and we're going to tell people about them.
[01:04:58.420 --> 01:04:59.420]   That's great.
[01:04:59.420 --> 01:05:02.260]   You're doing that with getting really good at reciting like the PR memories.
[01:05:02.260 --> 01:05:03.260]   Yeah, a lot.
[01:05:03.260 --> 01:05:05.060]   I mean, really good at repeating them now.
[01:05:05.060 --> 01:05:06.900]   But soon I promise soon.
[01:05:06.900 --> 01:05:07.900]   That's all right.
[01:05:07.900 --> 01:05:08.900]   Welcome to the club.
[01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:09.900]   It's all I get from everybody.
[01:05:09.900 --> 01:05:11.900]   It's also here.
[01:05:11.900 --> 01:05:14.260]   And I'm really proud to say it.
[01:05:14.260 --> 01:05:15.260]   Damn.
[01:05:15.260 --> 01:05:22.060]   He's got his own camera.
[01:05:22.060 --> 01:05:25.940]   Frogpants.com.
[01:05:25.940 --> 01:05:28.300]   Are you on the, what show are you on on this network?
[01:05:28.300 --> 01:05:29.300]   You're on forecast.
[01:05:29.300 --> 01:05:30.300]   That's right.
[01:05:30.300 --> 01:05:31.300]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:05:31.300 --> 01:05:32.300]   Part man, part spread.
[01:05:32.300 --> 01:05:34.140]   She's all Scott Johnson.
[01:05:34.140 --> 01:05:36.140]   That's right.
[01:05:36.140 --> 01:05:37.980]   The featured list with Bob.
[01:05:37.980 --> 01:05:41.980]   No, the reason is, and as soon as, as soon as somebody bows, I just don't, and why I go
[01:05:41.980 --> 01:05:42.980]   into it.
[01:05:42.980 --> 01:05:44.220]   It's just too long and boring.
[01:05:44.220 --> 01:05:46.420]   So as, uh, should good to have you.
[01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:49.140]   It's good to be a day Sullivan search engine.
[01:05:49.140 --> 01:05:50.340]   Like you want to take off Danny Sullivan?
[01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:51.540]   Yeah, I got to jump off.
[01:05:51.540 --> 01:05:52.820]   I'm going to, going to be in trouble.
[01:05:52.820 --> 01:05:54.620]   The fourth is firing up outside.
[01:05:54.620 --> 01:05:56.980]   You go with transformers too, huh?
[01:05:56.980 --> 01:06:00.740]   No, I would advise nobody to see transformers and save your life.
[01:06:00.740 --> 01:06:02.700]   Three hours and 20 minutes.
[01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:04.180]   I wish I could get back.
[01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:05.500]   There you go.
[01:06:05.500 --> 01:06:07.500]   But best if you go.
[01:06:07.500 --> 01:06:09.420]   Get in line early.
[01:06:09.420 --> 01:06:10.420]   Yeah.
[01:06:10.420 --> 01:06:11.420]   Thank you, Danny.
[01:06:11.420 --> 01:06:13.060]   Danny is at searchengineland.com.
[01:06:13.060 --> 01:06:19.380]   Really a great astute observer of, of all things search and Google related in.
[01:06:19.380 --> 01:06:24.220]   I love that I've been giving out the link to the SEO periodic table over and over again.
[01:06:24.220 --> 01:06:25.220]   You really did a nice job in that.
[01:06:25.220 --> 01:06:26.220]   It's very useful.
[01:06:26.220 --> 01:06:27.220]   Yeah.
[01:06:27.220 --> 01:06:28.220]   All right.
[01:06:28.220 --> 01:06:29.220]   Take care of it.
[01:06:29.220 --> 01:06:30.220]   Thanks Danny.
[01:06:30.220 --> 01:06:31.220]   Take care.
[01:06:31.220 --> 01:06:32.220]   Good.
[01:06:32.220 --> 01:06:33.820]   Now I can give a camera to, to Scott and he'll, he won't have to confuse him with somebody
[01:06:33.820 --> 01:06:34.820]   else from now.
[01:06:34.820 --> 01:06:35.820]   He didn't do it with this spreadsheet.
[01:06:35.820 --> 01:06:36.820]   With a spreadsheet.
[01:06:36.820 --> 01:06:40.980]   Hey, I do want to, as long as we're taking a break, talk about audible.com.
[01:06:40.980 --> 01:06:42.620]   I know Brian, you're a big audible fan.
[01:06:42.620 --> 01:06:43.620]   Oh my gosh.
[01:06:43.620 --> 01:06:45.220]   Scott, you've got to be an audible fan.
[01:06:45.220 --> 01:06:46.220]   Love audible.
[01:06:46.220 --> 01:06:48.060]   Who doesn't, who doesn't love audible?
[01:06:48.060 --> 01:06:49.060]   Really.
[01:06:49.060 --> 01:06:50.060]   One guy.
[01:06:50.060 --> 01:06:51.060]   He lives in Poughkeepsie.
[01:06:51.060 --> 01:06:53.840]   That's why this ad is really a complete waste of time because we know you're already
[01:06:53.840 --> 01:06:54.840]   audible members.
[01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:56.860]   In fact, if you're not, what the heck?
[01:06:56.860 --> 01:06:58.620]   What the hey you doing here?
[01:06:58.620 --> 01:07:01.700]   Audible is a great bookstore of audio books.
[01:07:01.700 --> 01:07:03.460]   Go ahead and audio entertainment.
[01:07:03.460 --> 01:07:04.700]   Not just audio books.
[01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:05.700]   Yeah.
[01:07:05.700 --> 01:07:06.700]   I mean, it's got newspapers.
[01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:10.500]   They've got historical like radio events from the past.
[01:07:10.500 --> 01:07:12.900]   They do a lot of pro bono stuff too.
[01:07:12.900 --> 01:07:17.020]   Debates and speeches, comedy performances too.
[01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:19.700]   They got that new children's book read by Samuel L. Jackson.
[01:07:19.700 --> 01:07:21.060]   What, go to the F.D.
[01:07:21.060 --> 01:07:22.060]   That's right.
[01:07:22.060 --> 01:07:25.660]   You're a young enough father that you probably appreciated that book no way.
[01:07:25.660 --> 01:07:26.660]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:07:26.660 --> 01:07:28.300]   Are you kidding me?
[01:07:28.300 --> 01:07:29.300]   Yeah.
[01:07:29.300 --> 01:07:30.300]   Awesome book.
[01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:36.660]   Go to audible.com right now and you can take a look at the amazing selection of wonderful
[01:07:36.660 --> 01:07:40.020]   materials at audible.com.
[01:07:40.020 --> 01:07:44.820]   I just, you know what I like about audible too is they periodically do these crazy sales.
[01:07:44.820 --> 01:07:46.900]   Like I snapped up a ton of $5 books.
[01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:48.900]   I must have spent like 30 bucks or something.
[01:07:48.900 --> 01:07:52.380]   Do that because I have the platinum subscription, the two books a month.
[01:07:52.380 --> 01:07:53.380]   Oh, so you just.
[01:07:53.380 --> 01:07:56.260]   And so I have a library of 500 books, many of which I haven't had time to listen to yet.
[01:07:56.260 --> 01:07:58.340]   So I'm saving up for retirement.
[01:07:58.340 --> 01:08:01.340]   Well, see, that's a good way to put it out like that.
[01:08:01.340 --> 01:08:02.780]   Yeah, I can't wait to listen.
[01:08:02.780 --> 01:08:03.780]   I mean, I'm not kidding.
[01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:06.900]   If you look at my library, this is one of the things that's so cool about audible is your
[01:08:06.900 --> 01:08:09.940]   library is always available to you.
[01:08:09.940 --> 01:08:11.300]   You can go back in time.
[01:08:11.300 --> 01:08:13.180]   I have will over the evolutionary void.
[01:08:13.180 --> 01:08:14.180]   Did you finish that?
[01:08:14.180 --> 01:08:15.180]   I'm almost done.
[01:08:15.180 --> 01:08:16.180]   One more.
[01:08:16.180 --> 01:08:17.180]   Look at this 24 hours.
[01:08:17.180 --> 01:08:18.580]   I'm down to the last eight hours.
[01:08:18.580 --> 01:08:19.580]   Don't you love?
[01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:23.380]   Don't you love how it's simultaneously a science fiction story and a fantasy story in parallel?
[01:08:23.380 --> 01:08:27.180]   You told me it was going to be that way and I, and I have to say, I really do like that.
[01:08:27.180 --> 01:08:29.580]   And they have a good reason for it to be that way.
[01:08:29.580 --> 01:08:31.380]   And the way it all comes together is fantastic.
[01:08:31.380 --> 01:08:32.380]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:08:32.380 --> 01:08:34.220]   Spoilers, but it really is a wonderful.
[01:08:34.220 --> 01:08:35.220]   Spoiler, I cried actually.
[01:08:35.220 --> 01:08:36.220]   I got all emotional.
[01:08:36.220 --> 01:08:37.220]   I got all emotional.
[01:08:37.220 --> 01:08:39.780]   Oh, don't tell me anything because I didn't know there's something to cry about.
[01:08:39.780 --> 01:08:40.780]   You know, well, yeah.
[01:08:40.780 --> 01:08:45.340]   I was weeping for the beauty of the universe.
[01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:47.140]   Space no one can hear you cry.
[01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:48.140]   You know.
[01:08:48.140 --> 01:08:49.140]   Audible dice.
[01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:50.220]   So you had a pick for us.
[01:08:50.220 --> 01:08:53.140]   By the way, I just want to tell everybody they can get this platinum plan.
[01:08:53.140 --> 01:08:54.140]   There's two books a month thing.
[01:08:54.140 --> 01:08:59.460]   If you go to audible.com/twit2, now that's for a month free.
[01:08:59.460 --> 01:09:01.340]   So you get two books for free basically.
[01:09:01.340 --> 01:09:03.140]   If you cancel it at any time, don't worry about it.
[01:09:03.140 --> 01:09:04.780]   Those books are yours always to keep.
[01:09:04.780 --> 01:09:07.700]   So you've always got them on your device or whatever.
[01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:09.620]   But it's a good way to start.
[01:09:09.620 --> 01:09:10.620]   So give them one or two.
[01:09:10.620 --> 01:09:11.620]   Whatever you want.
[01:09:11.620 --> 01:09:12.620]   Totally going to cheat.
[01:09:12.620 --> 01:09:13.620]   Totally cheating on this one.
[01:09:13.620 --> 01:09:17.620]   It's not fair and you're going to have to file it away and it's going to make sense to
[01:09:17.620 --> 01:09:18.620]   somebody who listens to this two weeks from now.
[01:09:18.620 --> 01:09:19.980]   No, no, I have two credits.
[01:09:19.980 --> 01:09:21.900]   I haven't renewed yet.
[01:09:21.900 --> 01:09:25.460]   In after you listen to your first book, your second one, two weeks from now, has to be
[01:09:25.460 --> 01:09:28.340]   book five of the Song of Ice and Fire series.
[01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:29.340]   Look five!
[01:09:29.340 --> 01:09:30.340]   Dance of Dragons.
[01:09:30.340 --> 01:09:31.340]   It just came out.
[01:09:31.340 --> 01:09:32.340]   Narrated by Roy Dottreece.
[01:09:32.340 --> 01:09:33.340]   Did it come out?
[01:09:33.340 --> 01:09:34.340]   I didn't just come out.
[01:09:34.340 --> 01:09:36.140]   It comes out in a couple of weeks, right?
[01:09:36.140 --> 01:09:37.140]   He's back though.
[01:09:37.140 --> 01:09:38.140]   That's right.
[01:09:38.140 --> 01:09:39.140]   He's back though.
[01:09:39.140 --> 01:09:40.140]   I kept correcting him.
[01:09:40.140 --> 01:09:43.700]   Every time he said a name, I would say it the way Roy Dottreece said it.
[01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:44.700]   That's not how Roy Dottreece said it.
[01:09:44.700 --> 01:09:48.740]   Phenomenal voice actor as he's tied for number one with Frank Mueller in my book.
[01:09:48.740 --> 01:09:49.740]   Yeah, I agree.
[01:09:49.740 --> 01:09:51.540]   No, I think Roy Dottreece made...
[01:09:51.540 --> 01:09:53.860]   Now if you watched Game of Thrones on HBO...
[01:09:53.860 --> 01:09:55.180]   Did you enjoy it?
[01:09:55.180 --> 01:09:57.540]   You know at first, the first one was so...
[01:09:57.540 --> 01:09:59.220]   There was so much gratuitous sex.
[01:09:59.220 --> 01:10:00.220]   Yes, of course.
[01:10:00.220 --> 01:10:01.220]   Well, what up?
[01:10:01.220 --> 01:10:02.220]   Sex.
[01:10:02.220 --> 01:10:03.220]   Welcome to HBO.
[01:10:03.220 --> 01:10:04.220]   But I've just kind of bugged me.
[01:10:04.220 --> 01:10:08.860]   It's like, well, I don't really need to see the chalices but at this moment.
[01:10:08.860 --> 01:10:09.860]   You know what?
[01:10:09.860 --> 01:10:11.580]   I didn't have a problem with that thing.
[01:10:11.580 --> 01:10:12.580]   Strangely enough.
[01:10:12.580 --> 01:10:16.380]   No, but then there was like...
[01:10:16.380 --> 01:10:19.540]   Then what's his name instructing to two girls on how to be a prostitute?
[01:10:19.540 --> 01:10:20.900]   I don't remember that from the book.
[01:10:20.900 --> 01:10:23.300]   I was okay with that injection as well.
[01:10:23.300 --> 01:10:24.300]   Strangely.
[01:10:24.300 --> 01:10:25.300]   They push some of that.
[01:10:25.300 --> 01:10:26.300]   It's HBO, right?
[01:10:26.300 --> 01:10:27.300]   It's HBO, I guess.
[01:10:27.300 --> 01:10:30.620]   However, any type of somebody has to give backstory or give a monologue, they make sure
[01:10:30.620 --> 01:10:33.180]   that there's either breasts or backs on it in there.
[01:10:33.180 --> 01:10:35.820]   On the other hand, it was a really good annotation.
[01:10:35.820 --> 01:10:40.260]   I was prepared to hate it because it's such a difficult story and there's so much of
[01:10:40.260 --> 01:10:41.260]   it.
[01:10:41.260 --> 01:10:42.260]   And they only had what?
[01:10:42.260 --> 01:10:43.260]   Ten episodes.
[01:10:43.260 --> 01:10:44.260]   Yeah.
[01:10:44.260 --> 01:10:45.260]   To tell.
[01:10:45.260 --> 01:10:46.260]   It's like an 800-page book.
[01:10:46.260 --> 01:10:47.260]   I think they did a marvelous job.
[01:10:47.260 --> 01:10:48.260]   So you know what?
[01:10:48.260 --> 01:10:49.260]   I don't know about book five.
[01:10:49.260 --> 01:10:50.260]   Let's get them started.
[01:10:50.260 --> 01:10:51.260]   Oh, yeah, fair enough.
[01:10:51.260 --> 01:10:52.260]   Fair enough.
[01:10:52.260 --> 01:10:53.260]   The Game of Thrones.
[01:10:53.260 --> 01:10:54.420]   That was the HBO series.
[01:10:54.420 --> 01:10:55.420]   That's over.
[01:10:55.420 --> 01:10:56.420]   You can watch that.
[01:10:56.420 --> 01:10:57.940]   And then there's the sequel to it.
[01:10:57.940 --> 01:11:01.180]   This is the whole song of "Ice and Fire" series.
[01:11:01.180 --> 01:11:03.300]   And there will be soon five books.
[01:11:03.300 --> 01:11:04.300]   There's four total.
[01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:05.460]   "Clash of Kings."
[01:11:05.460 --> 01:11:07.020]   I already have that one.
[01:11:07.020 --> 01:11:08.020]   Storm was...
[01:11:08.020 --> 01:11:09.020]   I'm going to go on that now.
[01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:10.260]   That's also Roy DeTries by the way.
[01:11:10.260 --> 01:11:13.180]   I thought I would read this now so that I'll be prepared for the next season.
[01:11:13.180 --> 01:11:14.180]   I was doing an original.
[01:11:14.180 --> 01:11:17.900]   And originally when I got like two episodes in, I'm like, "I gotta reread this whole series."
[01:11:17.900 --> 01:11:20.100]   But then they did so good with HBO.
[01:11:20.100 --> 01:11:21.940]   I don't think I'm gonna watch the...
[01:11:21.940 --> 01:11:22.940]   I don't think I'm gonna read the first one.
[01:11:22.940 --> 01:11:24.700]   I don't need to reread the Game of Thrones.
[01:11:24.700 --> 01:11:25.700]   I agree with you.
[01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:26.700]   I agree.
[01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:27.700]   Yeah.
[01:11:27.700 --> 01:11:29.500]   However, I am gonna read the "Clash of Kings" because I haven't read it yet.
[01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:30.500]   Yeah.
[01:11:30.500 --> 01:11:32.500]   Before, I'd like to read the book before I watch it on TV.
[01:11:32.500 --> 01:11:33.500]   Oh, you totally should.
[01:11:33.500 --> 01:11:34.500]   37 hours.
[01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:35.500]   This would be great now.
[01:11:35.500 --> 01:11:40.460]   You can get that for free and Game of Thrones for free and get started, get really hooked.
[01:11:40.460 --> 01:11:44.180]   You're gonna get a total of 70 hours of great books.
[01:11:44.180 --> 01:11:48.220]   And if you like it, then Roy DeTries reads number three as well, the Storm of Swords and...
[01:11:48.220 --> 01:11:50.220]   Number four, you have to be indulgent.
[01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:51.220]   Let me know.
[01:11:51.220 --> 01:11:52.220]   John Lee does a...
[01:11:52.220 --> 01:11:53.220]   No, don't...
[01:11:53.220 --> 01:11:54.220]   Oh, is it really bad?
[01:11:54.220 --> 01:11:55.220]   John Lee is no...
[01:11:55.220 --> 01:11:56.860]   If you're gonna play something, play Roy DeTries.
[01:11:56.860 --> 01:11:57.860]   I just want to just hear.
[01:11:57.860 --> 01:11:58.860]   Okay, you can.
[01:11:58.860 --> 01:11:59.860]   I gotta hear.
[01:11:59.860 --> 01:12:00.860]   Alright.
[01:12:00.860 --> 01:12:07.860]   Wait a minute.
[01:12:07.860 --> 01:12:10.260]   I think that's the guy who does the evolutionary void.
[01:12:10.260 --> 01:12:11.260]   The voice here.
[01:12:11.260 --> 01:12:12.260]   It is.
[01:12:12.260 --> 01:12:13.260]   Oh my gosh, your mind.
[01:12:13.260 --> 01:12:14.260]   So he's actually a great narrator.
[01:12:14.260 --> 01:12:15.260]   No, he is.
[01:12:15.260 --> 01:12:16.260]   He is.
[01:12:16.260 --> 01:12:17.260]   But you're spoiled because you've been listening to Roy DeTries.
[01:12:17.260 --> 01:12:20.180]   Because Roy makes those characters come alive with those particular voices in the end.
[01:12:20.180 --> 01:12:22.140]   Let me just play a little Roy DeTries just so you hear it.
[01:12:22.140 --> 01:12:23.900]   No, I think John Lee is one of their...
[01:12:23.900 --> 01:12:29.540]   The sound of a game of Thrones, the one of the song of Aisholibot.
[01:12:29.540 --> 01:12:34.540]   By George R.R. Martin, read by Roy DeTries.
[01:12:34.540 --> 01:12:36.540]   We prologue.
[01:12:36.540 --> 01:12:41.700]   You're not getting any characters here, I don't think.
[01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:45.220]   You know, sometimes they give you a nice chunk right in the middle and sometimes...
[01:12:45.220 --> 01:12:46.220]   Try to, you never know.
[01:12:46.220 --> 01:12:47.780]   You'll see all the problems Roy DeTries does.
[01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:49.780]   Everybody sounds like they're 105 years old.
[01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:51.780]   Yes, they're all quite old.
[01:12:51.780 --> 01:12:52.780]   And very British.
[01:12:52.780 --> 01:12:53.780]   He did not mind.
[01:12:53.780 --> 01:12:57.380]   Someone must take his place.
[01:12:57.380 --> 01:12:59.980]   And soon that he would like.
[01:12:59.980 --> 01:13:02.020]   He let the younger man settle himself behind you.
[01:13:02.020 --> 01:13:05.460]   You know, I think people, it's unfortunate because just a little clip of him doing justice.
[01:13:05.460 --> 01:13:09.180]   I think people who haven't read these books will go, "Well, I don't want to listen to
[01:13:09.180 --> 01:13:10.980]   that guy for 37 hours.
[01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:11.980]   No trust me."
[01:13:11.980 --> 01:13:15.580]   It is electric and he is alive with those characters live inside his mouth.
[01:13:15.580 --> 01:13:16.980]   Yes, it's a performance.
[01:13:16.980 --> 01:13:19.820]   But I think John Lee does a great job of the Void Trilogy.
[01:13:19.820 --> 01:13:20.820]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:13:20.820 --> 01:13:24.060]   He's like, I mean, I'm really enjoying the Void Trilogy.
[01:13:24.060 --> 01:13:25.060]   So there you go.
[01:13:25.060 --> 01:13:26.500]   Trilogies are us.
[01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:28.740]   You get plenty of books to listen to.
[01:13:28.740 --> 01:13:31.380]   If you are not yet an Audible member, please do yourself a favor.
[01:13:31.380 --> 01:13:34.380]   Go to audible.com/twit2.
[01:13:34.380 --> 01:13:36.740]   Sign up for the two books a month.
[01:13:36.740 --> 01:13:38.100]   I think that's a good amount.
[01:13:38.100 --> 01:13:41.420]   See, because I don't always get through both books.
[01:13:41.420 --> 01:13:42.740]   But so I'm a little bit behind.
[01:13:42.740 --> 01:13:45.860]   But that way I've got books when I'm old.
[01:13:45.860 --> 01:13:47.700]   Or when like sometimes you just go on benders.
[01:13:47.700 --> 01:13:48.700]   You ever notice that?
[01:13:48.700 --> 01:13:49.700]   Yeah.
[01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:50.700]   It's like you're working out every single day for a whole month.
[01:13:50.700 --> 01:13:51.700]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:13:51.700 --> 01:13:52.700]   That's absolutely right.
[01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:55.500]   And of course at some point I'll probably be bedridden and then I can listen to that
[01:13:55.500 --> 01:13:56.340]   as well.
[01:13:56.340 --> 01:13:59.020]   So there's so much stuff.
[01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:00.020]   Look at this.
[01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:02.860]   Anything you want 40 lessons for a new kind of entrepreneur?
[01:14:02.860 --> 01:14:07.260]   The deal from hell, how moguls in Wall Street plundered great American newspapers.
[01:14:07.260 --> 01:14:10.100]   If you're interested in current events, if you're interested in history, if you're interested
[01:14:10.100 --> 01:14:15.980]   in novels, there's just nothing you can't get an Audible.com.
[01:14:15.980 --> 01:14:16.980]   I just love it.
[01:14:16.980 --> 01:14:17.980]   And it plays of course on everything.
[01:14:17.980 --> 01:14:23.500]   In fact, if you've got the Kindle now, Audible's library shows up on the new Kindle software,
[01:14:23.500 --> 01:14:26.220]   which means you can download any Audible book and listen to it on your Kindle or read
[01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:27.220]   it as well.
[01:14:27.220 --> 01:14:28.220]   Just fantastic.
[01:14:28.220 --> 01:14:32.340]   Audible.com/twit2 we thank him for their support.
[01:14:32.340 --> 01:14:34.340]   Now before we lose yet another panelist.
[01:14:34.340 --> 01:14:37.220]   Yeah, I got like 10, 15 minutes here.
[01:14:37.220 --> 01:14:38.220]   Gosh darn it.
[01:14:38.220 --> 01:14:39.220]   All right.
[01:14:39.220 --> 01:14:40.220]   No, that's okay.
[01:14:40.220 --> 01:14:41.220]   We'll just do a very short.
[01:14:41.220 --> 01:14:42.220]   Oh my God.
[01:14:42.220 --> 01:14:44.220]   Brian is gone.
[01:14:44.220 --> 01:14:45.220]   It's magic.
[01:14:45.220 --> 01:14:46.700]   He's turned into a unicorn.
[01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:48.220]   It's more his magic.
[01:14:48.220 --> 01:14:49.220]   It is.
[01:14:49.220 --> 01:14:50.460]   He's actually there.
[01:14:50.460 --> 01:14:52.580]   But you can't see him.
[01:14:52.580 --> 01:14:53.700]   You've worked for them for years.
[01:14:53.700 --> 01:14:55.380]   You understand how this is, Scott Johnson.
[01:14:55.380 --> 01:14:57.020]   I think you, yeah.
[01:14:57.020 --> 01:14:59.100]   Well, my spreadsheet technology alone.
[01:14:59.100 --> 01:15:02.020]   I'm so sorry.
[01:15:02.020 --> 01:15:03.580]   Now you have your very own camera.
[01:15:03.580 --> 01:15:06.580]   See, I can, it's perfect.
[01:15:06.580 --> 01:15:08.220]   So let's talk about the Nortail patents.
[01:15:08.220 --> 01:15:12.500]   And actually this was going to be, this was going to be our special question for Brian.
[01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:14.300]   So when he comes back, I'll give it to him.
[01:15:14.300 --> 01:15:19.660]   But 6,000 plus Nortail patents available.
[01:15:19.660 --> 01:15:22.540]   Why first of all would anybody want these patents, Neelite?
[01:15:22.540 --> 01:15:26.740]   You know, patent litigation is about like tonnage.
[01:15:26.740 --> 01:15:28.340]   At this point it really is.
[01:15:28.340 --> 01:15:31.220]   These patents were on communication technologies.
[01:15:31.220 --> 01:15:33.540]   There were a lot of patents that touched on LTE.
[01:15:33.540 --> 01:15:35.220]   There's a lot of wireless patents in there.
[01:15:35.220 --> 01:15:41.300]   In general, the more you have on your side, sort of the better off you are on litigation.
[01:15:41.300 --> 01:15:42.300]   Right?
[01:15:42.300 --> 01:15:48.700]   And it really isn't about necessarily like specifics or what actual rights the patents
[01:15:48.700 --> 01:15:50.020]   give you.
[01:15:50.020 --> 01:15:55.580]   It's about, well, patent litigation is often described as mutually assured destruction.
[01:15:55.580 --> 01:15:56.580]   Right?
[01:15:56.580 --> 01:16:00.540]   And it's compared most frequently to nuclear war, which I think is very interesting when
[01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:04.580]   you consider the state of litigation in this country that we're often comparing just one
[01:16:04.580 --> 01:16:07.700]   type of standard litigation to nuclear war constantly.
[01:16:07.700 --> 01:16:09.220]   Like something is probably wrong.
[01:16:09.220 --> 01:16:10.220]   Right.
[01:16:10.220 --> 01:16:11.220]   But that's the state of things.
[01:16:11.220 --> 01:16:12.540]   But now Google lost, right?
[01:16:12.540 --> 01:16:13.540]   They bid.
[01:16:13.540 --> 01:16:15.340]   But who got these Nortail patents?
[01:16:15.340 --> 01:16:16.340]   Right.
[01:16:16.340 --> 01:16:17.340]   So there's a consortium of companies.
[01:16:17.340 --> 01:16:18.820]   They named themselves Rockstar.
[01:16:18.820 --> 01:16:23.860]   So it was Apple, Microsoft, RIM, a few other major companies that you've heard of and a
[01:16:23.860 --> 01:16:25.660]   few little companies you haven't heard of.
[01:16:25.660 --> 01:16:26.660]   And they were going up against Google.
[01:16:26.660 --> 01:16:29.580]   I think they spent $4.5 billion in total.
[01:16:29.580 --> 01:16:32.100]   And Google said, well, we're going to cap out at four.
[01:16:32.100 --> 01:16:33.580]   So Google could have been in the game.
[01:16:33.580 --> 01:16:36.740]   They certainly have an extra half billion dollars to bid.
[01:16:36.740 --> 01:16:40.420]   But I think they reached the limit of what they wanted to spend.
[01:16:40.420 --> 01:16:43.380]   Was it a mistake for them not to acquire these patents?
[01:16:43.380 --> 01:16:47.020]   Doesn't this threaten Android and a lot of other Google?
[01:16:47.020 --> 01:16:50.540]   You know, I don't think so.
[01:16:50.540 --> 01:16:54.380]   There's been a lot of talk about these patents just because anytime you get these companies
[01:16:54.380 --> 01:16:57.980]   directly competing, it generates a lot of conversation.
[01:16:57.980 --> 01:16:58.980]   But really it doesn't.
[01:16:58.980 --> 01:17:02.300]   I mean, Apple is suing every Google OEM anyway.
[01:17:02.300 --> 01:17:08.100]   Microsoft is going after every Google OEM and asking for a license agreement, some royalty
[01:17:08.100 --> 01:17:09.380]   fees anyway.
[01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:12.500]   So what these patents really do is they provide additional ammunition.
[01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:17.660]   I mean, it's kind of like the height of the Cold War you would read about the United States
[01:17:17.660 --> 01:17:18.660]   developed a new missile.
[01:17:18.660 --> 01:17:20.500]   You're like, oh man, that's awesome.
[01:17:20.500 --> 01:17:23.540]   You're definitely going to win the Cold War now.
[01:17:23.540 --> 01:17:25.260]   That's never how that worked.
[01:17:25.260 --> 01:17:27.260]   It's about the perceived threat of force.
[01:17:27.260 --> 01:17:30.780]   And it's about-- I mean, literally, that's why it's always compared to nuclear war.
[01:17:30.780 --> 01:17:34.980]   So it's not about firing these off and winning settlements and getting royalties.
[01:17:34.980 --> 01:17:38.620]   It's about negotiating settlements and license agreements down the line.
[01:17:38.620 --> 01:17:42.540]   Some people said that Google wasn't serious in its bids.
[01:17:42.540 --> 01:17:44.460]   Now, this is-- OK, this is for you, Brian.
[01:17:44.460 --> 01:17:46.620]   Oh, this is the math question.
[01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:47.620]   Yeah.
[01:17:47.620 --> 01:17:50.780]   So maybe you can figure out why Google was bidding what it was bidding because a lot of
[01:17:50.780 --> 01:17:52.580]   people looked at this and said, what are they talking about?
[01:17:52.580 --> 01:17:57.580]   So the first bid was $1,902,160,540.
[01:17:57.580 --> 01:17:59.580]   So $1.9 billion.
[01:17:59.580 --> 01:18:04.980]   Their second bid was $2,614,972.
[01:18:04.980 --> 01:18:07.260]   So it was very specific, these numbers.
[01:18:07.260 --> 01:18:13.540]   $2,600,600,600,600,600,600,600,600,600,600,600,600,600,600,600,600,600,600,600,600,000.
[01:18:13.540 --> 01:18:14.540]   I know why.
[01:18:14.540 --> 01:18:15.540]   Why?
[01:18:15.540 --> 01:18:18.380]   Because if you flip it upside down on a calculator, he says boobies.
[01:18:18.380 --> 01:18:19.380]   No.
[01:18:19.380 --> 01:18:20.380]   No.
[01:18:20.380 --> 01:18:21.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:18:21.380 --> 01:18:22.380]   Wouldn't that be funny?
[01:18:22.380 --> 01:18:23.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:18:23.380 --> 01:18:25.540]   That's what they-- OK, but this will give it away.
[01:18:25.540 --> 01:18:27.860]   Their final bid-- and they never did your right.
[01:18:27.860 --> 01:18:29.700]   They did not want to go over $4 billion.
[01:18:29.700 --> 01:18:35.100]   Their final bid was $3 billion, $141,590,000.
[01:18:35.100 --> 01:18:38.100]   Oh, $3,14,159.
[01:18:38.100 --> 01:18:40.100]   Yay, the math is--
[01:18:40.100 --> 01:18:41.100]   --and then pi.
[01:18:41.100 --> 01:18:42.100]   So the-- you're right.
[01:18:42.100 --> 01:18:43.700]   They were all famous numbers.
[01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:44.700]   The first--
[01:18:44.700 --> 01:18:45.700]   Irrational numbers.
[01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:49.100]   Do you think it's significant that they picked irrational numbers for the bids?
[01:18:49.100 --> 01:18:50.100]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:18:50.100 --> 01:18:52.220]   Like, maybe that's a double play.
[01:18:52.220 --> 01:18:54.660]   The first number was-- what was it?
[01:18:54.660 --> 01:18:55.660]   It was probably-- it was probably--
[01:18:55.660 --> 01:18:56.660]   Like the most sent primer.
[01:18:56.660 --> 01:18:58.500]   So the-- the golden ratio I've been to.
[01:18:58.500 --> 01:19:00.100]   It was 1.6, you said?
[01:19:00.100 --> 01:19:01.100]   No, no, no.
[01:19:01.100 --> 01:19:04.180]   It's-- they're really wild constants that nobody's ever heard of.
[01:19:04.180 --> 01:19:05.180]   OK.
[01:19:05.180 --> 01:19:06.180]   It's pure scientific constants.
[01:19:06.180 --> 01:19:08.180]   They're trying, but it's constant.
[01:19:08.180 --> 01:19:13.460]   So, you know what's funny is I think they did this when they did 700 megahertz auction
[01:19:13.460 --> 01:19:14.460]   as well.
[01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:15.460]   Did they really--
[01:19:15.460 --> 01:19:17.900]   I think they have a strategy of goofy bids.
[01:19:17.900 --> 01:19:22.620]   And I think, you know, it kind of like irritated like the other members of the auction who
[01:19:22.620 --> 01:19:24.820]   were like, why are these bids so crazy and precise?
[01:19:24.820 --> 01:19:26.460]   But I think Google just does this.
[01:19:26.460 --> 01:19:27.460]   I think this is part of their--
[01:19:27.460 --> 01:19:28.460]   I love it.
[01:19:28.460 --> 01:19:29.460]   I think the irreverence--
[01:19:29.460 --> 01:19:32.380]   What was the first number again?
[01:19:32.380 --> 01:19:34.380]   Something like an astronaut--
[01:19:34.380 --> 01:19:35.380]   1,1019021605.
[01:19:35.380 --> 01:19:36.380]   OK.
[01:19:36.380 --> 01:19:37.380]   No, no, no.
[01:19:37.380 --> 01:19:38.380]   Yeah.
[01:19:38.380 --> 01:19:41.020]   Somebody was saying it was a Fibonacci sequence with that one.
[01:19:41.020 --> 01:19:42.020]   No, no, no.
[01:19:42.020 --> 01:19:43.020]   It's not.
[01:19:43.020 --> 01:19:44.020]   It's a constant.
[01:19:44.020 --> 01:19:45.020]   It's awesome.
[01:19:45.020 --> 01:19:46.780]   That's geeky as I'll get out.
[01:19:46.780 --> 01:19:47.780]   I love that.
[01:19:47.780 --> 01:19:48.780]   That's so great, though.
[01:19:48.780 --> 01:19:49.780]   What a great way to get backdoor publicity.
[01:19:49.780 --> 01:19:50.780]   That's so awesome.
[01:19:50.780 --> 01:19:51.780]   I think it's wonderful.
[01:19:51.780 --> 01:19:52.780]   It just--
[01:19:52.780 --> 01:19:53.780]   That's pretty.
[01:19:53.780 --> 01:19:56.540]   But some said, oh, that shows Google was irreverent and really didn't want to win this.
[01:19:56.540 --> 01:19:59.740]   And we do know that they really didn't want to win the spectrum auction, right, you know?
[01:19:59.740 --> 01:20:00.740]   Yeah, they didn't.
[01:20:00.740 --> 01:20:05.740]   They wanted to trigger the open access provisions, which they completely walked away from as
[01:20:05.740 --> 01:20:07.220]   soon as they got into bed with Verizon.
[01:20:07.220 --> 01:20:12.540]   But at the time, they were in opposition to Verizon and they wanted to trigger this sort
[01:20:12.540 --> 01:20:14.900]   of quote unquote net neutrality provisions of the auction.
[01:20:14.900 --> 01:20:15.900]   And they did it.
[01:20:15.900 --> 01:20:16.900]   They won.
[01:20:16.900 --> 01:20:17.900]   But this one, I think, they actually wanted to win.
[01:20:17.900 --> 01:20:18.900]   I think--
[01:20:18.900 --> 01:20:19.900]   It's like I'm saying.
[01:20:19.900 --> 01:20:23.700]   It's like you want the protection of having these 6,000 patents on your side.
[01:20:23.700 --> 01:20:25.860]   But they're not screwed by not having it.
[01:20:25.860 --> 01:20:29.740]   But I like that analogy of the Cold War because it was-- and they were talking about this
[01:20:29.740 --> 01:20:30.740]   on Tech News Today.
[01:20:30.740 --> 01:20:32.900]   They were talking about how patent law is really kind of a thing.
[01:20:32.900 --> 01:20:35.340]   Holy crap, it's Robert Skovill.
[01:20:35.340 --> 01:20:36.340]   Get in here.
[01:20:36.340 --> 01:20:37.340]   Where's that website?
[01:20:37.340 --> 01:20:39.140]   Is Skovill in this room, Doug?
[01:20:39.140 --> 01:20:40.140]   It's Skovill.
[01:20:40.140 --> 01:20:41.140]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:20:41.140 --> 01:20:44.140]   But they were talking about--
[01:20:44.140 --> 01:20:45.140]   Oh my god.
[01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:46.140]   This is just my Skovill happening.
[01:20:46.140 --> 01:20:50.060]   They were talking about on Tech News Today that you want to have just a fistful of patents
[01:20:50.060 --> 01:20:54.460]   just so that if Apple were to try to enforce their patent on-- that they just got granted
[01:20:54.460 --> 01:20:56.940]   that you could say, well, it's going to be a lot of trouble because we're going to hit
[01:20:56.940 --> 01:20:57.940]   you with X, Y, and Z and all these.
[01:20:57.940 --> 01:20:58.940]   Right.
[01:20:58.940 --> 01:21:01.940]   So this is a great transition to the Apple Samsung thing.
[01:21:01.940 --> 01:21:03.740]   That's exactly what Samsung is doing, right?
[01:21:03.740 --> 01:21:04.740]   Yeah.
[01:21:04.740 --> 01:21:05.740]   Apple suit them.
[01:21:05.740 --> 01:21:06.740]   So Samsung's suing them back.
[01:21:06.740 --> 01:21:07.740]   Yeah.
[01:21:07.740 --> 01:21:08.740]   And this report--
[01:21:08.740 --> 01:21:10.940]   Actually, Samsung dropped its lawsuits this week.
[01:21:10.940 --> 01:21:12.140]   That's really inaccurate.
[01:21:12.140 --> 01:21:13.940]   I don't know why it's being reported like that.
[01:21:13.940 --> 01:21:14.940]   Oh.
[01:21:14.940 --> 01:21:16.940]   I've been meaning to write something about it, but it's a holiday week.
[01:21:16.940 --> 01:21:17.940]   Correct.
[01:21:17.940 --> 01:21:18.940]   Correct.
[01:21:18.940 --> 01:21:21.740]   So what they-- so Apple sued Samsung, right?
[01:21:21.740 --> 01:21:23.740]   And then once you get sued, you have a number of options.
[01:21:23.740 --> 01:21:25.740]   And one of those options is sue the guy back.
[01:21:25.740 --> 01:21:26.740]   Counter-sust.
[01:21:26.740 --> 01:21:27.740]   Right.
[01:21:27.740 --> 01:21:30.980]   So what I'm going to do is put it on is Samsung filed a separate counter-suit.
[01:21:30.980 --> 01:21:33.140]   And they've also filed counter-suits in what?
[01:21:33.140 --> 01:21:37.580]   Germany, Japan, South Korea, in the ITC.
[01:21:37.580 --> 01:21:40.220]   They filed all these actions against Apple and other places.
[01:21:40.220 --> 01:21:44.100]   And I think what they've decided to do is they said, well, we're not going to have two
[01:21:44.100 --> 01:21:45.820]   separate lawsuits in the United States.
[01:21:45.820 --> 01:21:46.820]   We'll just have one.
[01:21:46.820 --> 01:21:49.780]   And that'll include our counter-suit in the United States.
[01:21:49.780 --> 01:21:52.660]   So we want to have two different judges and two different lawsuits going on.
[01:21:52.660 --> 01:21:57.860]   So they dismissed their-- they dropped their other one, their independent Samsung versus
[01:21:57.860 --> 01:22:02.460]   Apple lawsuit, and wrapped all of those claims into the existing lawsuit.
[01:22:02.460 --> 01:22:04.980]   So it's like a very technical procedural thing.
[01:22:04.980 --> 01:22:06.780]   And when I read it, I was like, oh, this isn't news.
[01:22:06.780 --> 01:22:07.780]   Nobody cares about this.
[01:22:07.780 --> 01:22:09.340]   Like, people care about outcomes.
[01:22:09.340 --> 01:22:10.340]   That's really interesting.
[01:22:10.340 --> 01:22:11.340]   Yeah.
[01:22:11.340 --> 01:22:12.340]   Everybody got that wrong.
[01:22:12.340 --> 01:22:13.340]   Yeah.
[01:22:13.340 --> 01:22:15.020]   And that's one of the things.
[01:22:15.020 --> 01:22:19.860]   Whenever I do legal stories, I have to divorce myself from how nerdy I am about procedure.
[01:22:19.860 --> 01:22:22.260]   Because procedure isn't important, right?
[01:22:22.260 --> 01:22:23.980]   That's why lawyers get paid.
[01:22:23.980 --> 01:22:27.700]   They get paid to manage the procedure and manage the boundaries of conflict.
[01:22:27.700 --> 01:22:30.820]   But what people care about, what's important, is the outcome.
[01:22:30.820 --> 01:22:33.140]   And how you get to the outcome, yeah, it's related to procedure.
[01:22:33.140 --> 01:22:36.900]   But this is like they dismissed one suit so they could put all the claims in another one
[01:22:36.900 --> 01:22:37.900]   that already exists.
[01:22:37.900 --> 01:22:40.380]   So that's where Samsung is right now.
[01:22:40.380 --> 01:22:42.540]   They're suing Apple back with everything they got.
[01:22:42.540 --> 01:22:46.740]   I mean, they're suing them in four countries and 10 venues.
[01:22:46.740 --> 01:22:50.180]   We talked to you when this lawsuit happened.
[01:22:50.180 --> 01:22:52.820]   Now that we're a little farther down the road, do you have a different take on it?
[01:22:52.820 --> 01:22:56.460]   Do you think you thought that they had some merit in the Apple had some merit in the trade
[01:22:56.460 --> 01:22:57.460]   risk?
[01:22:57.460 --> 01:23:02.220]   You know, I still think Apple has a lot of merit in just sort of confusion in a marketplace,
[01:23:02.220 --> 01:23:03.220]   right?
[01:23:03.220 --> 01:23:06.300]   I mean, I think Samsung's products are consciously designed to look like Apple products.
[01:23:06.300 --> 01:23:11.020]   And I think Apple's right to say, well, there's a line in your over it, right?
[01:23:11.020 --> 01:23:12.900]   Where that line is, that's a big argument.
[01:23:12.900 --> 01:23:15.420]   And I think everybody has a different opinion than that.
[01:23:15.420 --> 01:23:18.420]   I think what I expected to happen has not happened.
[01:23:18.420 --> 01:23:20.940]   And I thought this would be over relatively quickly.
[01:23:20.940 --> 01:23:25.580]   I did not expect Samsung to fight back so vociferously.
[01:23:25.580 --> 01:23:31.580]   The intensity of Samsung's response indicates to me that this isn't going to be over anytime
[01:23:31.580 --> 01:23:32.580]   soon.
[01:23:32.580 --> 01:23:36.820]   I mean, the sheer number of countries and courts that Samsung has responded in and attacked
[01:23:36.820 --> 01:23:40.700]   Apple in indicates to me that this problem, I mean, you don't get to wrap all that up
[01:23:40.700 --> 01:23:42.220]   neatly, right?
[01:23:42.220 --> 01:23:43.220]   You're fighting.
[01:23:43.220 --> 01:23:46.140]   Like you're, you've opened up fronts of war and you're going for it.
[01:23:46.140 --> 01:23:49.980]   Now, what, you know, and we've heard reports that Apple's going to take their manufacturing
[01:23:49.980 --> 01:23:55.420]   away from Samsung and take the A6 or whatever to TSMC and so Samsung's foundries.
[01:23:55.420 --> 01:23:57.220]   I mean, these are big checks.
[01:23:57.220 --> 01:23:58.220]   That's retaliation.
[01:23:58.220 --> 01:23:59.220]   Yeah.
[01:23:59.220 --> 01:24:03.100]   And you know, I've heard a lot of speculation that, you know, Samsung's like, okay, well,
[01:24:03.100 --> 01:24:07.660]   we're going to protect our high margin phone business and maybe we'll lose some of the
[01:24:07.660 --> 01:24:10.860]   low margin manufacturing, but the phones are what's important.
[01:24:10.860 --> 01:24:12.100]   I mean, that's the future.
[01:24:12.100 --> 01:24:15.180]   So we'll protect that and you can take your, you know, your dinghy little chip business
[01:24:15.180 --> 01:24:16.100]   away.
[01:24:16.100 --> 01:24:17.100]   I don't know if any of that's true.
[01:24:17.100 --> 01:24:18.100]   Maybe this will settle tomorrow.
[01:24:18.100 --> 01:24:22.140]   Maybe both companies will realize we're spending way too much money for this to make sense.
[01:24:22.140 --> 01:24:26.580]   But right now, the intensity of the conflict is that they're all time high and Samsung
[01:24:26.580 --> 01:24:31.540]   consolidating a suit to streamline it is like that indicates basically nothing.
[01:24:31.540 --> 01:24:32.540]   I'm loving it.
[01:24:32.540 --> 01:24:33.540]   They're trying to get organized.
[01:24:33.540 --> 01:24:34.540]   Right.
[01:24:34.540 --> 01:24:38.540]   I'm loving all this war imagery because in the chat room, somebody just sounded, let's
[01:24:38.540 --> 01:24:41.060]   play a game of global thermonuclear law.
[01:24:41.060 --> 01:24:42.060]   Play.
[01:24:42.060 --> 01:24:43.060]   Okay.
[01:24:43.060 --> 01:24:45.020]   So you just, usually, imagine if they both win, right?
[01:24:45.020 --> 01:24:46.500]   I mean, this is the really crazy thing.
[01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:51.540]   If they both win, then they both like, they both found, you know, liable for willful patent
[01:24:51.540 --> 01:24:52.540]   infringement.
[01:24:52.540 --> 01:24:54.460]   That's triple damages or whatever they ask for.
[01:24:54.460 --> 01:24:55.460]   That's an insane amount of money.
[01:24:55.460 --> 01:24:57.180]   They'll just go in a circle, right?
[01:24:57.180 --> 01:24:58.180]   Because Apple off the pace.
[01:24:58.180 --> 01:25:00.220]   You pay it up at you and then, right.
[01:25:00.220 --> 01:25:03.260]   Or in the court will say, well, you have to stop, you know, is it conceivable they could
[01:25:03.260 --> 01:25:04.260]   both win?
[01:25:04.260 --> 01:25:05.860]   Yeah, of course it is.
[01:25:05.860 --> 01:25:07.860]   I mean, against each other, it's all.
[01:25:07.860 --> 01:25:08.860]   It's really good.
[01:25:08.860 --> 01:25:09.860]   Yeah.
[01:25:09.860 --> 01:25:14.140]   It didn't, Apple filed an injunction saying let's stop Samsung from selling phones in
[01:25:14.140 --> 01:25:15.140]   the US.
[01:25:15.140 --> 01:25:16.140]   Yeah.
[01:25:16.140 --> 01:25:19.020]   I mean, that's what they, because not because of patents, right?
[01:25:19.020 --> 01:25:20.460]   Because of trademarks.
[01:25:20.460 --> 01:25:24.020]   Because they say the phones are too similar, that they're causing consumer confusion.
[01:25:24.020 --> 01:25:25.460]   I have to pull this apart.
[01:25:25.460 --> 01:25:29.620]   You know, again, I've been lazy on a holiday weekend and I, because this is my next, and
[01:25:29.620 --> 01:25:34.500]   not an actual like, our news site, I let myself get away with not working over the weekend.
[01:25:34.500 --> 01:25:37.100]   But come Tuesday, I'll have an analysis of that injunction.
[01:25:37.100 --> 01:25:40.980]   I mean, basically they're saying you go into a Verizon store and there's a fascinating
[01:25:40.980 --> 01:25:42.340]   in the iPhone.
[01:25:42.340 --> 01:25:46.300]   People are not sophisticated enough to know the difference.
[01:25:46.300 --> 01:25:49.820]   And again, you can argue about that as much as you want.
[01:25:49.820 --> 01:25:52.540]   Apple's well-written, it's right to say people are getting confused.
[01:25:52.540 --> 01:25:54.220]   And Samsung's well-written, it's right to say no, they're not.
[01:25:54.220 --> 01:25:57.180]   And the judge has to decide, you know, based on all this evidence.
[01:25:57.180 --> 01:26:01.860]   But the injunction is specifically, you can't just go ahead and let people get confused
[01:26:01.860 --> 01:26:04.180]   without stopping it, because it's causing harm to Apple.
[01:26:04.180 --> 01:26:06.300]   And then that's Apple's argument, the injunction.
[01:26:06.300 --> 01:26:09.180]   So yeah, that, I mean, this is all time high.
[01:26:09.180 --> 01:26:13.060]   You know, these reports of Samsung dropping a patent lawsuit completely.
[01:26:13.060 --> 01:26:16.260]   It's staring at a tree while the forest is like on fire.
[01:26:16.260 --> 01:26:17.260]   You know what I mean?
[01:26:17.260 --> 01:26:18.700]   It's like, stop looking at the tree guys.
[01:26:18.700 --> 01:26:19.700]   Take a look around.
[01:26:19.700 --> 01:26:23.900]   Hey, Nile, we're going to, we're going to, I know you've got a very important business
[01:26:23.900 --> 01:26:24.900]   meeting to go to.
[01:26:24.900 --> 01:26:28.140]   I would date with Rosie Huntington-Wightly, in 3D.
[01:26:28.140 --> 01:26:32.340]   And I'd like to go, I'd like to go to that meeting.
[01:26:32.340 --> 01:26:33.940]   But you know, it's good.
[01:26:33.940 --> 01:26:34.940]   You're more than welcome to.
[01:26:34.940 --> 01:26:36.700]   We thank you so much for joining us.
[01:26:36.700 --> 01:26:38.500]   This is mynecks.com, that's the website.
[01:26:38.500 --> 01:26:43.220]   Go there and something wonderful is about to happen.
[01:26:43.220 --> 01:26:45.220]   Yes, something magical and extraordinary.
[01:26:45.220 --> 01:26:47.540]   That's a line from 2010, right?
[01:26:47.540 --> 01:26:48.540]   Something's going to happen.
[01:26:48.540 --> 01:26:49.540]   Something wonderful.
[01:26:49.540 --> 01:26:52.660]   And as soon as he gets launched, we'll come on the show and we'll talk about how we,
[01:26:52.660 --> 01:26:56.300]   somebody else has already done everything that we're doing.
[01:26:56.300 --> 01:26:58.180]   And then Samsung will sue your ass.
[01:26:58.180 --> 01:26:59.180]   Exactly.
[01:26:59.180 --> 01:27:00.180]   Thank you, Nile.
[01:27:00.180 --> 01:27:01.180]   It was great being here.
[01:27:01.180 --> 01:27:02.180]   Have a good weekend, everybody.
[01:27:02.180 --> 01:27:03.180]   Always a pleasure.
[01:27:03.180 --> 01:27:04.180]   Take care.
[01:27:04.180 --> 01:27:05.180]   Nile, Patel.
[01:27:05.180 --> 01:27:06.180]   This is mynecks.com.
[01:27:06.180 --> 01:27:07.180]   It's amazing.
[01:27:07.180 --> 01:27:08.180]   Oh, wait.
[01:27:08.180 --> 01:27:09.180]   Oh, it's not Scott Johnson.
[01:27:09.180 --> 01:27:10.180]   Holy cow.
[01:27:10.180 --> 01:27:11.180]   It's Mr. Robert Scobble.
[01:27:11.180 --> 01:27:22.740]   I was going to check though because I had to make sure on the web that it says you're
[01:27:22.740 --> 01:27:23.900]   not in this room, Robert.
[01:27:23.900 --> 01:27:24.900]   I didn't check in.
[01:27:24.900 --> 01:27:25.900]   Yeah, I didn't check in.
[01:27:25.900 --> 01:27:26.900]   Check in.
[01:27:26.900 --> 01:27:27.900]   Check in.
[01:27:27.900 --> 01:27:28.900]   I was crazy.
[01:27:28.900 --> 01:27:29.900]   That'll change.
[01:27:29.900 --> 01:27:34.300]   You think it could change?
[01:27:34.300 --> 01:27:36.180]   If you're going to use that page, I have to tweet.
[01:27:36.180 --> 01:27:37.180]   There you go.
[01:27:37.180 --> 01:27:38.180]   Why don't you tweet?
[01:27:38.180 --> 01:27:39.180]   Oh, is that what they're watching?
[01:27:39.180 --> 01:27:40.180]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:27:40.180 --> 01:27:41.180]   But let me check in first.
[01:27:41.180 --> 01:27:42.180]   All right.
[01:27:42.180 --> 01:27:44.220]   But no, I was driving home from that, but it's so hot.
[01:27:44.220 --> 01:27:45.500]   We just wanted to go home, right?
[01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:48.820]   That's why you pulled over is because you wanted the AC that you knew what you did.
[01:27:48.820 --> 01:27:49.820]   Holy cow.
[01:27:49.820 --> 01:27:50.820]   It's unfortunate.
[01:27:50.820 --> 01:27:51.820]   We just need to go to Starbucks.
[01:27:51.820 --> 01:27:53.780]   We had our whole conversation about Google Plus.
[01:27:53.780 --> 01:27:54.780]   I was listening to it.
[01:27:54.780 --> 01:27:55.780]   It was great.
[01:27:55.780 --> 01:27:56.780]   Oh, good.
[01:27:56.780 --> 01:27:57.780]   All right.
[01:27:57.780 --> 01:27:58.780]   I actually, anything to add?
[01:27:58.780 --> 01:28:00.780]   I actually just came by because I can't ever get into your hangouts.
[01:28:00.780 --> 01:28:02.780]   Oh, it's very hard to get into.
[01:28:02.780 --> 01:28:05.100]   So I figured I'd just crash the ultimate hangout.
[01:28:05.100 --> 01:28:06.100]   This is just a quick crash.
[01:28:06.100 --> 01:28:07.100]   The party like that.
[01:28:07.100 --> 01:28:09.180]   It's easier to get into than the Google hangout.
[01:28:09.180 --> 01:28:10.180]   You just walk in the door.
[01:28:10.180 --> 01:28:11.180]   Yeah.
[01:28:11.180 --> 01:28:12.180]   Oh my god.
[01:28:12.180 --> 01:28:13.180]   They're moving us.
[01:28:13.180 --> 01:28:14.180]   Oh my god.
[01:28:14.180 --> 01:28:16.940]   That's how you could tell the wines been had when all of a sudden everything was.
[01:28:16.940 --> 01:28:17.940]   So what did you bring us?
[01:28:17.940 --> 01:28:19.740]   This is some fresh wine.
[01:28:19.740 --> 01:28:22.740]   Sorry, Scott, that you're kind of left out in the corner.
[01:28:22.740 --> 01:28:25.100]   Yeah, you brought some paradox wine with some redone glasses.
[01:28:25.100 --> 01:28:26.700]   You get hammered on your own though.
[01:28:26.700 --> 01:28:27.700]   Play the home game.
[01:28:27.700 --> 01:28:29.700]   I'm not going to say anything.
[01:28:29.700 --> 01:28:30.700]   All right.
[01:28:30.700 --> 01:28:33.700]   And by the way, who is Henry and why should we obey him?
[01:28:33.700 --> 01:28:34.700]   You'd have to ask Tom.
[01:28:34.700 --> 01:28:37.500]   It's a long, it's a, it's an all in private meat.
[01:28:37.500 --> 01:28:38.500]   I'll put it that way.
[01:28:38.500 --> 01:28:40.100]   It's hard to work after a little bit.
[01:28:40.100 --> 01:28:41.100]   I like it.
[01:28:41.100 --> 01:28:42.100]   I like it.
[01:28:42.100 --> 01:28:47.540]   So Scobles tweeting in a moment, the website should accurately reflect his presence in
[01:28:47.540 --> 01:28:48.540]   this room.
[01:28:48.540 --> 01:28:49.540]   It does.
[01:28:49.540 --> 01:28:50.540]   But that's OK.
[01:28:50.540 --> 01:28:53.180]   Oh, you so, is this all for not?
[01:28:53.180 --> 01:28:54.900]   All for not.
[01:28:54.900 --> 01:28:58.700]   So did you, you did hear our conversation, Robert, about Google Plus.
[01:28:58.700 --> 01:28:59.700]   Do you have any?
[01:28:59.700 --> 01:29:01.700]   Is there anything we got wrong or you would disagree with?
[01:29:01.700 --> 01:29:02.900]   No, I didn't hear it.
[01:29:02.900 --> 01:29:05.220]   I think the analysis Danny and everybody's doing it.
[01:29:05.220 --> 01:29:06.220]   It's pretty good.
[01:29:06.220 --> 01:29:07.220]   Pretty good guys in here talking about it.
[01:29:07.220 --> 01:29:08.220]   Yeah.
[01:29:08.220 --> 01:29:09.220]   I just wanted to know.
[01:29:09.220 --> 01:29:10.220]   But you love it.
[01:29:10.220 --> 01:29:12.740]   Well, I love it, but I wonder after the new car smell wears off.
[01:29:12.740 --> 01:29:13.740]   Right.
[01:29:13.740 --> 01:29:14.740]   There's a lot of new car smell.
[01:29:14.740 --> 01:29:15.940]   And you know, look at this.
[01:29:15.940 --> 01:29:16.940]   Here's Michael Dell.
[01:29:16.940 --> 01:29:19.340]   Yeah, that Michael Dell.
[01:29:19.340 --> 01:29:20.340]   Random hangout.
[01:29:20.340 --> 01:29:21.340]   Hangout.
[01:29:21.340 --> 01:29:23.180]   You know, I mean, that's kind of amazing.
[01:29:23.180 --> 01:29:24.580]   It's sort of like going to Davos.
[01:29:24.580 --> 01:29:25.580]   I'll tell you.
[01:29:25.580 --> 01:29:26.580]   Yeah.
[01:29:26.580 --> 01:29:28.260]   I mean, just random hangout.
[01:29:28.260 --> 01:29:30.780]   And these aren't all Dell people.
[01:29:30.780 --> 01:29:33.300]   And yet, and yet there he is.
[01:29:33.300 --> 01:29:34.780]   Android swag.com.
[01:29:34.780 --> 01:29:36.220]   Susan's with Dell, I know.
[01:29:36.220 --> 01:29:40.500]   I think it's the hangout feature that will prevent, even after the new car smell goes
[01:29:40.500 --> 01:29:44.140]   away, you will still need to use hangout for certain functions.
[01:29:44.140 --> 01:29:45.140]   Except for one thing.
[01:29:45.140 --> 01:29:46.140]   Well, Facebook.
[01:29:46.140 --> 01:29:47.140]   Yeah.
[01:29:47.140 --> 01:29:48.140]   Facebook bringing on Wednesday.
[01:29:48.140 --> 01:29:49.140]   That's awesome.
[01:29:49.140 --> 01:29:50.140]   Guys, look at us.
[01:29:50.140 --> 01:29:52.140]   Hey guys, guys, stop looking at Google.
[01:29:52.140 --> 01:29:58.220]   It's funny, though, because when Microsoft bought Skype, that was my immediate speculation
[01:29:58.220 --> 01:30:03.140]   is that maybe they wanted not only for other reasons, but that one of the advantages to
[01:30:03.140 --> 01:30:08.060]   this purchase would be that Facebook, who they have a small but not insignificant investment
[01:30:08.060 --> 01:30:09.580]   and could use this.
[01:30:09.580 --> 01:30:13.020]   And even then, I said, well, wouldn't that be a killer app that you're in your Facebook
[01:30:13.020 --> 01:30:14.780]   and you can open up a video chat?
[01:30:14.780 --> 01:30:19.140]   Wasn't it Microsoft that pioneered the whole group of people and when one talks, it goes
[01:30:19.140 --> 01:30:20.140]   big thing.
[01:30:20.140 --> 01:30:21.140]   I forget one application.
[01:30:21.140 --> 01:30:22.820]   A lot of, they did have one of that.
[01:30:22.820 --> 01:30:23.980]   But it wasn't just Microsoft.
[01:30:23.980 --> 01:30:26.980]   A lot of companies that do video conferencing have that feature.
[01:30:26.980 --> 01:30:30.980]   The Google technology is actually from video.
[01:30:30.980 --> 01:30:34.700]   Although we asked Vigio, I mean, we asked Vic about that on Twig this on Wednesday.
[01:30:34.700 --> 01:30:38.180]   He said, "I don't want to, yes, it's video now, but I don't want to say video because
[01:30:38.180 --> 01:30:40.100]   we want to change codecs."
[01:30:40.100 --> 01:30:45.500]   And of course, Google has its own WebRTC, as we mentioned, and WebM, video codecs.
[01:30:45.500 --> 01:30:47.380]   Presumably they'll go to those open source codecs.
[01:30:47.380 --> 01:30:49.100]   On the, I think they want to make this open.
[01:30:49.100 --> 01:30:51.100]   I think that's what's very interesting about this.
[01:30:51.100 --> 01:30:55.300]   Well, we needed it on the iPhone and the iPad and the Android devices.
[01:30:55.300 --> 01:30:57.180]   It's sad that we can't use it.
[01:30:57.180 --> 01:30:59.060]   Did anybody use that?
[01:30:59.060 --> 01:31:01.540]   Buy an HP touchpad this week.
[01:31:01.540 --> 01:31:02.540]   Anybody.
[01:31:02.540 --> 01:31:03.540]   No.
[01:31:03.540 --> 01:31:04.540]   Anybody.
[01:31:04.540 --> 01:31:05.540]   No.
[01:31:05.540 --> 01:31:08.540]   I mean, I get such a friend of mine who-
[01:31:08.540 --> 01:31:10.260]   I don't want to buy Web OS so much.
[01:31:10.260 --> 01:31:14.460]   Yeah, a friend of mine who lives real close to me is one of the VPs there.
[01:31:14.460 --> 01:31:16.260]   So I've seen it and played with it.
[01:31:16.260 --> 01:31:18.580]   I just know apps until there's apps.
[01:31:18.580 --> 01:31:20.300]   It's a chicken and egg problem.
[01:31:20.300 --> 01:31:21.300]   It's the same problem.
[01:31:21.300 --> 01:31:22.300]   What else does it mean?
[01:31:22.300 --> 01:31:23.300]   It's true multitasking.
[01:31:23.300 --> 01:31:26.620]   That lets me focus on more than one task at hand.
[01:31:26.620 --> 01:31:31.980]   My emails, apps, videos, music, one swipe, one flick and done.
[01:31:31.980 --> 01:31:34.660]   As a child, I thought that was a way of dealing with bookers.
[01:31:34.660 --> 01:31:37.540]   Now I know it's a way of dealing with robot buttlers.
[01:31:37.540 --> 01:31:41.220]   Yeah, the second and the last two or three of these are pretty good.
[01:31:41.220 --> 01:31:42.220]   Alright, let's play the second one.
[01:31:42.220 --> 01:31:43.220]   The second one's worth watching.
[01:31:43.220 --> 01:31:47.500]   I wish I couldn't see his eyes move as he rose.
[01:31:47.500 --> 01:31:50.580]   Just type pretty much completes my thoughts for me.
[01:31:50.580 --> 01:31:51.580]   Like a woman.
[01:31:51.580 --> 01:31:57.260]   All I have to do is start typing and Web OS will search my touchpad and the web.
[01:31:57.260 --> 01:32:00.620]   Quick actions let me access an app without having to launch it.
[01:32:00.620 --> 01:32:06.060]   If I have a brilliant idea, which I did once, it was in 1989, that idea was the idea of
[01:32:06.060 --> 01:32:07.300]   sticker albums.
[01:32:07.300 --> 01:32:11.780]   Well, I just add it to my task list, sticker albums.
[01:32:11.780 --> 01:32:14.740]   Just type and away we go.
[01:32:14.740 --> 01:32:16.580]   You know, he's married to Katy Perry.
[01:32:16.580 --> 01:32:17.580]   Is he really?
[01:32:17.580 --> 01:32:20.180]   I don't know if I would really, I don't wait but there's more.
[01:32:20.180 --> 01:32:22.380]   Oh no, they got like eight of these.
[01:32:22.380 --> 01:32:23.380]   Alright, should we go?
[01:32:23.380 --> 01:32:25.980]   No, jump ahead to like last three or so.
[01:32:25.980 --> 01:32:26.980]   Yeah, just jump ahead.
[01:32:26.980 --> 01:32:28.980]   I think the second and last was pretty good.
[01:32:28.980 --> 01:32:29.980]   Put in here entertainment everywhere.
[01:32:29.980 --> 01:32:33.180]   Doesn't it feel like a kind of stone rock star is floating this problem?
[01:32:33.180 --> 01:32:34.180]   Play games.
[01:32:34.180 --> 01:32:36.580]   I think it's a very hip way for them to market it.
[01:32:36.580 --> 01:32:41.580]   It's a tablet for people who really are too stone to come there.
[01:32:41.580 --> 01:32:42.580]   Literally in the book.
[01:32:42.580 --> 01:32:44.980]   Now you've got no excuse for ever being bored again.
[01:32:44.980 --> 01:32:45.980]   I'm bored.
[01:32:45.980 --> 01:32:46.980]   So...
[01:32:46.980 --> 01:32:53.780]   So, I mean, I was going to run out and buy this thing because I thought, oh, I loved WebOS.
[01:32:53.780 --> 01:32:54.780]   I love the pre.
[01:32:54.780 --> 01:32:55.780]   You like the pre, right?
[01:32:55.780 --> 01:32:58.180]   It's nice but it's the same slam.
[01:32:58.180 --> 01:33:00.180]   It's so little slow when it has no apps.
[01:33:00.180 --> 01:33:01.180]   That's the funny thing.
[01:33:01.180 --> 01:33:03.180]   I thought the pre was just underpowered hardware.
[01:33:03.180 --> 01:33:07.660]   Turns out even with powered dual core hardware, it's still slow.
[01:33:07.660 --> 01:33:11.380]   And only 35 apps is really kind of a problem if you're trying to do it.
[01:33:11.380 --> 01:33:16.380]   You know, I mean, if you're going to recommend this to normal, to everyday people, it's like
[01:33:16.380 --> 01:33:19.740]   get the iPad or maybe an Android if you don't like Apple.
[01:33:19.740 --> 01:33:23.580]   So I'll tell you what this reminds me of is the movie.
[01:33:23.580 --> 01:33:24.900]   This is going to sound weird.
[01:33:24.900 --> 01:33:28.100]   The movie "Prince of Persia" at the movie.
[01:33:28.100 --> 01:33:35.340]   The movie "Prince of Persia" on rock tomato has 33% positive reviews.
[01:33:35.340 --> 01:33:42.740]   And at 33%, it is the second highest most positively reviewed video game movie in history.
[01:33:42.740 --> 01:33:50.540]   So the first being, I think, Final Fantasy had like 66% positive reviews or 66% positive.
[01:33:50.540 --> 01:33:54.900]   And so it's one of those things where it's like at like three out of five stars on CNET.
[01:33:54.900 --> 01:33:57.620]   This is the second highest rated tablet.
[01:33:57.620 --> 01:33:59.460]   Yeah, but what is number one?
[01:33:59.460 --> 01:34:00.460]   The iPad.
[01:34:00.460 --> 01:34:02.100]   And that's the fundamental question.
[01:34:02.100 --> 01:34:06.020]   And Harry McCracken to his credit was the guy who asked it a week ago on "Techologizer."
[01:34:06.020 --> 01:34:10.640]   He said, "What you've got to ask is why shouldn't I buy an iPad?
[01:34:10.640 --> 01:34:15.060]   What is there in this new device that says to me, 'Don't buy this instead of an iPad?'"
[01:34:15.060 --> 01:34:16.060]   And there's nothing.
[01:34:16.060 --> 01:34:17.060]   I think it's all about apps.
[01:34:17.060 --> 01:34:21.140]   I mean, I go around startups and interview startups and see what they're doing.
[01:34:21.140 --> 01:34:24.540]   They're all building for iOS first, then Android.
[01:34:24.540 --> 01:34:25.540]   But you know what?
[01:34:25.540 --> 01:34:26.540]   Here's an interesting surprise.
[01:34:26.540 --> 01:34:28.340]   The tablet guys are all building for iOS period.
[01:34:28.340 --> 01:34:29.340]   No Android.
[01:34:29.340 --> 01:34:30.340]   Yeah, why bother?
[01:34:30.340 --> 01:34:31.340]   But here's an interesting surprise.
[01:34:31.340 --> 01:34:33.340]   Windows Phone 7, 25,000 apps.
[01:34:33.340 --> 01:34:35.340]   Would you have the crappy apps?
[01:34:35.340 --> 01:34:36.340]   I mean, come on.
[01:34:36.340 --> 01:34:38.840]   The guy who's like birds and satellites versus someone.
[01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:43.260]   500 of them are inactive right now of the 24,000 or whatever.
[01:34:43.260 --> 01:34:44.260]   I mean, come on.
[01:34:44.260 --> 01:34:47.900]   I've pulled out, you know, I have a Windows Phone 7 and I keep thinking it's going to
[01:34:47.900 --> 01:34:48.900]   be great.
[01:34:48.900 --> 01:34:49.900]   And you keep pulling out the apps.
[01:34:49.900 --> 01:34:51.820]   They're not as good as iOS apps.
[01:34:51.820 --> 01:34:52.820]   And the--
[01:34:52.820 --> 01:34:53.820]   Is that it?
[01:34:53.820 --> 01:34:55.820]   If you don't have apps, you've got nothing.
[01:34:55.820 --> 01:34:56.820]   To me, that's the--
[01:34:56.820 --> 01:34:57.820]   Do that's it?
[01:34:57.820 --> 01:34:59.820]   That's why the Genesis beat the TurboGraphic 16.
[01:34:59.820 --> 01:35:01.820]   That's why the NES beat the Sega Mac.
[01:35:01.820 --> 01:35:02.820]   No, that's just--
[01:35:02.820 --> 01:35:03.820]   I don't think gaming--
[01:35:03.820 --> 01:35:04.820]   Oh, apps are games.
[01:35:04.820 --> 01:35:05.820]   Come on.
[01:35:05.820 --> 01:35:06.820]   The vast majority.
[01:35:06.820 --> 01:35:07.820]   A good chunk of them are.
[01:35:07.820 --> 01:35:09.820]   Yeah, but if you look at what's number one on--
[01:35:09.820 --> 01:35:10.820]   It's the same for what it's about the software.
[01:35:10.820 --> 01:35:14.900]   And to be honest, that's why PC beat Mac for years is because the software was on PC.
[01:35:14.900 --> 01:35:17.860]   If you wanted the game was on PC and it wasn't on your Apple TV.
[01:35:17.860 --> 01:35:18.860]   Really?
[01:35:18.860 --> 01:35:19.860]   You think it's just--
[01:35:19.860 --> 01:35:20.860]   It's all down to games?
[01:35:20.860 --> 01:35:21.860]   Well, no, it's software.
[01:35:21.860 --> 01:35:22.860]   The software, the software.
[01:35:22.860 --> 01:35:23.860]   Apps.
[01:35:23.860 --> 01:35:24.860]   But I think the gaming community is different.
[01:35:24.860 --> 01:35:26.860]   I mean, they are very software driven.
[01:35:26.860 --> 01:35:27.860]   Absolutely.
[01:35:27.860 --> 01:35:29.860]   There's still a lot of people who say, well, all you need is 20 apps.
[01:35:29.860 --> 01:35:30.860]   Well, that's true, but you need--
[01:35:30.860 --> 01:35:31.860]   Right, 20.
[01:35:31.860 --> 01:35:35.100]   Well, you need 10 of the big name apps like Angry Birds, you know--
[01:35:35.100 --> 01:35:36.100]   Ever No.
[01:35:36.100 --> 01:35:38.940]   Twitter, Facebook, that kind of thing.
[01:35:38.940 --> 01:35:42.300]   And then the other 20 are like your bank.
[01:35:42.300 --> 01:35:45.300]   Your work is going to build an app for doing expense rewards.
[01:35:45.300 --> 01:35:48.620]   But working can build an app for anything but iPhone or iPhone.
[01:35:48.620 --> 01:35:49.620]   Or Android.
[01:35:49.620 --> 01:35:53.420]   A lot of people I meet on planes who have Android, I ask them, why didn't you get an
[01:35:53.420 --> 01:35:54.420]   Android?
[01:35:54.420 --> 01:35:58.100]   He goes, my work forced me to have an Android instead of letting me buy an iPhone.
[01:35:58.100 --> 01:36:02.940]   So there's-- and that's going to drive IT decisions inside businesses.
[01:36:02.940 --> 01:36:04.940]   They're going to build apps for those funds.
[01:36:04.940 --> 01:36:06.580]   Is it over for RIM and the playbook--
[01:36:06.580 --> 01:36:07.580]   [SIGHS]
[01:36:07.580 --> 01:36:09.500]   RIM, you saw that open letter by--
[01:36:09.500 --> 01:36:14.020]   Well, it's not like anonymous figures are posting letters criticizing their own bow.
[01:36:14.020 --> 01:36:15.020]   Wait a minute.
[01:36:15.020 --> 01:36:16.980]   That's exactly what's happening.
[01:36:16.980 --> 01:36:20.300]   I don't see how they pull the plane out of the dive that they're in.
[01:36:20.300 --> 01:36:21.300]   They're in a big dive.
[01:36:21.300 --> 01:36:21.820]   All right.
[01:36:21.820 --> 01:36:23.420]   And it comes down to apps.
[01:36:23.420 --> 01:36:28.060]   Can you get developers-- real developers, the developers that Kleiner Perkins is investing
[01:36:28.060 --> 01:36:32.220]   in, but not the little hobbyist developer, but the guys who are going to make Flipboard.
[01:36:32.220 --> 01:36:34.340]   Can you get those guys excited about your platform?
[01:36:34.340 --> 01:36:35.700]   If you can't, you're out.
[01:36:35.700 --> 01:36:39.300]   So here's the race now is between iOS and Android, because they're the last two people
[01:36:39.300 --> 01:36:43.300]   standing in this race for the corporate market.
[01:36:43.300 --> 01:36:47.180]   Whoever has the most secure apps, whoever has the most secure messaging, the most in-house
[01:36:47.180 --> 01:36:52.300]   stuff, that's who's going to dominate and take the space left open by RIM.
[01:36:52.300 --> 01:36:53.300]   Yeah.
[01:36:53.300 --> 01:36:57.700]   I mean, look at Google+, it made me pick up my Android phone for the first time in weeks.
[01:36:57.700 --> 01:36:58.700]   It's awesome.
[01:36:58.700 --> 01:36:59.700]   It comes down to apps.
[01:36:59.700 --> 01:37:03.780]   Do you even have the apps that drive people to pick up a new device?
[01:37:03.780 --> 01:37:08.260]   It's too bad Google is so egalitarian, because if they were really cutthroat, they just wouldn't
[01:37:08.260 --> 01:37:10.180]   do an iOS device, the app.
[01:37:10.180 --> 01:37:11.180]   Oh, no.
[01:37:11.180 --> 01:37:12.180]   It's too early.
[01:37:12.180 --> 01:37:13.180]   It's too early.
[01:37:13.180 --> 01:37:16.460]   They're playing multiple games with multiple players.
[01:37:16.460 --> 01:37:21.020]   It's like they're playing a chess game against Facebook, but they're playing checkers over
[01:37:21.020 --> 01:37:23.100]   here against the iPhone.
[01:37:23.100 --> 01:37:24.540]   So it's like, you got to play.
[01:37:24.540 --> 01:37:25.540]   You got to be careful about everything.
[01:37:25.540 --> 01:37:29.460]   Hey, Scott Johnson, does some of your income come from Amazon affiliate fees?
[01:37:29.460 --> 01:37:33.900]   A little bit, but think goodness, I live in Utah and not California.
[01:37:33.900 --> 01:37:35.220]   No kidding.
[01:37:35.220 --> 01:37:39.380]   Can I move my account to your address?
[01:37:39.380 --> 01:37:40.380]   Okay.
[01:37:40.380 --> 01:37:43.380]   So I'm only going to save $400 in three years and Amazon.
[01:37:43.380 --> 01:37:45.220]   No, I made $20,000 last year.
[01:37:45.220 --> 01:37:46.220]   You do it professionally.
[01:37:46.220 --> 01:37:50.100]   Well, because it's the Twitch account and so forth, the 2020 grant.
[01:37:50.100 --> 01:37:53.740]   And by the way, okay, so first let me give you the news story.
[01:37:53.740 --> 01:37:59.420]   Amazon is, well, in response to a new California law, signed into a law last week by the way,
[01:37:59.420 --> 01:38:00.420]   by our governor.
[01:38:00.420 --> 01:38:01.420]   What's the name of the governor now?
[01:38:01.420 --> 01:38:02.420]   The Brown.
[01:38:02.420 --> 01:38:03.420]   Is it Jerry Brown?
[01:38:03.420 --> 01:38:04.420]   It's Jerry Ricky track.
[01:38:04.420 --> 01:38:05.420]   It was Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[01:38:05.420 --> 01:38:07.980]   You don't even know the general Brown.
[01:38:07.980 --> 01:38:11.500]   I do know, but it's like, doesn't matter.
[01:38:11.500 --> 01:38:12.500]   It doesn't even matter.
[01:38:12.500 --> 01:38:13.500]   Who's the governor?
[01:38:13.500 --> 01:38:14.500]   What used to call moonbeam?
[01:38:14.500 --> 01:38:15.500]   Remember the seven?
[01:38:15.500 --> 01:38:16.500]   Moon governor moonbeam.
[01:38:16.500 --> 01:38:17.660]   He wasn't, wasn't he governor before?
[01:38:17.660 --> 01:38:18.660]   Yeah.
[01:38:18.660 --> 01:38:19.660]   Okay.
[01:38:19.660 --> 01:38:20.660]   I'm not crazy.
[01:38:20.660 --> 01:38:21.660]   No, you're not.
[01:38:21.660 --> 01:38:22.660]   You look familiar.
[01:38:22.660 --> 01:38:23.660]   Okay.
[01:38:23.660 --> 01:38:27.180]   So anyway, Jerry Brown signs into law a new sales tech law that says Amazon has to collect
[01:38:27.180 --> 01:38:30.700]   sales tax on all purchases in California.
[01:38:30.700 --> 01:38:32.100]   Now this is what's interesting.
[01:38:32.100 --> 01:38:36.740]   California has always had a use tax law on your 540, your California income tax.
[01:38:36.740 --> 01:38:39.700]   It says, how much did you buy online?
[01:38:39.700 --> 01:38:41.020]   You got to pay the sales tax.
[01:38:41.020 --> 01:38:42.020]   What's your use tax?
[01:38:42.020 --> 01:38:43.260]   Most, most states have that.
[01:38:43.260 --> 01:38:44.260]   Most states do.
[01:38:44.260 --> 01:38:47.580]   And it's so, so the thing about sales tax is not that you don't know it.
[01:38:47.580 --> 01:38:49.260]   It's that who collects it.
[01:38:49.260 --> 01:38:54.740]   Will the, will the retailer collect it or are you required to pay, take, no, I paid $6,000
[01:38:54.740 --> 01:38:55.940]   in use tax last year.
[01:38:55.940 --> 01:38:56.940]   Right.
[01:38:56.940 --> 01:39:01.980]   They've got $8,000 in Amazon and they've cut their throats on both because now Amazon
[01:39:01.980 --> 01:39:05.940]   has come back to California as they did to North Carolina as they did to New York and
[01:39:05.940 --> 01:39:09.620]   said, well, if you're going to do that, we're going to withdraw from the state because if
[01:39:09.620 --> 01:39:12.460]   we don't do business in the state, we don't have to collect sales tax.
[01:39:12.460 --> 01:39:15.420]   And I don't know if this is different from the other times, but they didn't just say
[01:39:15.420 --> 01:39:16.940]   we're going to withdraw from the state.
[01:39:16.940 --> 01:39:17.940]   They did.
[01:39:17.940 --> 01:39:18.940]   They said, as of now we are withdrawn.
[01:39:18.940 --> 01:39:19.940]   I got the email.
[01:39:19.940 --> 01:39:20.940]   You would like us to come back.
[01:39:20.940 --> 01:39:21.940]   Then you got it.
[01:39:21.940 --> 01:39:23.180]   You can't pass this law.
[01:39:23.180 --> 01:39:24.940]   And again, it's like, it makes sense.
[01:39:24.940 --> 01:39:28.900]   It's like they can't be bogged down in the paperwork of every, because if it's, if you
[01:39:28.900 --> 01:39:31.060]   could do that for every state, then you have to do that for every county.
[01:39:31.060 --> 01:39:32.060]   If you could do that for every county.
[01:39:32.060 --> 01:39:33.060]   All right.
[01:39:33.060 --> 01:39:34.060]   I agree.
[01:39:34.060 --> 01:39:35.060]   I agree.
[01:39:35.060 --> 01:39:36.060]   Municipal.
[01:39:36.060 --> 01:39:38.060]   And by the way, I'm completely, I'm completely gored by this because I've lost a huge amount
[01:39:38.060 --> 01:39:39.060]   of revenue.
[01:39:39.060 --> 01:39:40.060]   I think all of us are.
[01:39:40.060 --> 01:39:41.540]   I mean, I mean, full disclosure, I think I don't think there's a person on the panel
[01:39:41.540 --> 01:39:43.540]   that doesn't make some kind of money from the Amazon.
[01:39:43.540 --> 01:39:47.300]   We're going to end up doing, we are a calif, Delaware corporation, but I haven't used
[01:39:47.300 --> 01:39:48.300]   it much.
[01:39:48.300 --> 01:39:49.300]   We're a Delaware corporation.
[01:39:49.300 --> 01:39:52.820]   So we're just going to have it go through Delaware and we'll, we'll still be able to.
[01:39:52.820 --> 01:39:53.820]   And I went to Texas.
[01:39:53.820 --> 01:39:58.340]   So, you know, when it came for the North Carolinians, I said nothing because I was
[01:39:58.340 --> 01:40:00.420]   not from North Carolina.
[01:40:00.420 --> 01:40:04.980]   When they came for the Californians, I said nothing because I was not from California.
[01:40:04.980 --> 01:40:06.980]   But pretty soon we're going to put you Texans in contact.
[01:40:06.980 --> 01:40:07.980]   I know.
[01:40:07.980 --> 01:40:08.980]   You can't say anything.
[01:40:08.980 --> 01:40:12.020]   No, I don't think the state of Texas will ever.
[01:40:12.020 --> 01:40:13.500]   It's on the list of people.
[01:40:13.500 --> 01:40:15.700]   Yeah, there's, there's apparently legislation being talked about.
[01:40:15.700 --> 01:40:17.540]   So this is very much I would think that would do that.
[01:40:17.540 --> 01:40:21.220]   I was, I was shocked when I saw that I actually went back and read the line twice.
[01:40:21.220 --> 01:40:22.220]   Yeah.
[01:40:22.220 --> 01:40:23.220]   So Texas, really?
[01:40:23.220 --> 01:40:24.980]   Part, part of it is they want to protect the local businesses.
[01:40:24.980 --> 01:40:25.980]   Well, that's okay.
[01:40:25.980 --> 01:40:26.980]   So now I'm going to play devil's advocate.
[01:40:26.980 --> 01:40:27.980]   Yeah.
[01:40:27.980 --> 01:40:29.220]   As I was going to say, I used to work at a camera store.
[01:40:29.220 --> 01:40:30.220]   You say hate online.
[01:40:30.220 --> 01:40:31.220]   Exactly.
[01:40:31.220 --> 01:40:34.860]   What about a brick and mortar that has to collect this sales tax in California.
[01:40:34.860 --> 01:40:38.140]   It's just went down, but it's nine percent sales tax.
[01:40:38.140 --> 01:40:41.260]   So people go into this camera store, they go, they say, Hey, Robert, can you show me
[01:40:41.260 --> 01:40:42.820]   the new Canada S 95?
[01:40:42.820 --> 01:40:44.780]   You show them, you help them, you talk all about it.
[01:40:44.780 --> 01:40:45.940]   They go, point out, it was great.
[01:40:45.940 --> 01:40:46.940]   Thank you so much, Robert.
[01:40:46.940 --> 01:40:48.340]   I've made my buying decision.
[01:40:48.340 --> 01:40:50.140]   And then they go to Amazon and buy it.
[01:40:50.140 --> 01:40:54.220]   I'll tell you what though, I think that is a perceived threat, not as big as the actual
[01:40:54.220 --> 01:40:56.780]   threat because it, and again, I can't speak for all the locations.
[01:40:56.780 --> 01:40:59.660]   I could tell you that mom and pop camera stores are in deep trouble.
[01:40:59.660 --> 01:41:03.500]   But in Texas, in Texas, fries, I went to go buy some stuff and I knew I'm like, I'm
[01:41:03.500 --> 01:41:04.660]   going to buy something from fries.
[01:41:04.660 --> 01:41:07.940]   And I know I'm going to have to pay retail for it and pay sales tax on top.
[01:41:07.940 --> 01:41:11.860]   And they for two weeks straight have had somebody at the front door handing out thousands, a
[01:41:11.860 --> 01:41:14.580]   little subs of paper that say we match internet pricing.
[01:41:14.580 --> 01:41:16.100]   Yes, internet pricing.
[01:41:16.100 --> 01:41:17.740]   Every single person who walks in the door.
[01:41:17.740 --> 01:41:21.300]   And I don't know if it's a kind of thing where it's like they're generating good will by
[01:41:21.300 --> 01:41:23.780]   saying that and most people won't even bother to do it.
[01:41:23.780 --> 01:41:27.140]   Best buy will too, they'll come down to a price if you have a price.
[01:41:27.140 --> 01:41:29.140]   Is that include sales tax?
[01:41:29.140 --> 01:41:31.740]   Yeah, you still pay the 10% sales tax.
[01:41:31.740 --> 01:41:34.340]   I don't mind paying the sales tax.
[01:41:34.340 --> 01:41:36.740]   It's the retail numbers for a printer cable.
[01:41:36.740 --> 01:41:37.740]   Okay, so that's a critical.
[01:41:37.740 --> 01:41:41.420]   So you're saying that it's not the sales tax that's influencing people's purchases,
[01:41:41.420 --> 01:41:42.420]   it's not that 10%.
[01:41:42.420 --> 01:41:45.420]   It's 10% a big deal.
[01:41:45.420 --> 01:41:47.420]   It's all together.
[01:41:47.420 --> 01:41:52.940]   If I'm buying a $3,000 computer, now Apple just charged me sales tax.
[01:41:52.940 --> 01:41:53.940]   It's hundreds of bucks.
[01:41:53.940 --> 01:41:54.940]   Oh yeah.
[01:41:54.940 --> 01:41:58.020]   And if I could go to Amazon and not pay it, you better believe I'd save that hundreds
[01:41:58.020 --> 01:41:59.020]   of bucks.
[01:41:59.020 --> 01:42:03.540]   The overhead for you know this by buying your new studio, paying retail footage fees is
[01:42:03.540 --> 01:42:08.220]   higher than paying some warehouse in the middle of nowhere that you can have people shipping
[01:42:08.220 --> 01:42:10.860]   to UPS or FedEx.
[01:42:10.860 --> 01:42:16.620]   So that's why we never could compete with them because we had the high rent of a storefront
[01:42:16.620 --> 01:42:21.940]   on a major street in Silicon Valley and we could never compete with the online guys.
[01:42:21.940 --> 01:42:25.380]   Plus they were working a different business model, the New York Camera Store.
[01:42:25.380 --> 01:42:28.900]   But again, I think a lot of these companies are realizing that they have a different role
[01:42:28.900 --> 01:42:29.900]   than online.
[01:42:29.900 --> 01:42:34.900]   For example, in Texas precision camera, right, in Austin, Texas, they are so from beginning
[01:42:34.900 --> 01:42:37.380]   to end, they make sure to educate you and buy the end.
[01:42:37.380 --> 01:42:39.500]   Well, that's how you solve this.
[01:42:39.500 --> 01:42:40.500]   Exactly.
[01:42:40.500 --> 01:42:44.140]   And I think the customer love you and want to pay that extra value.
[01:42:44.140 --> 01:42:45.140]   You provide extra value.
[01:42:45.140 --> 01:42:46.140]   It's such a good job.
[01:42:46.140 --> 01:42:47.140]   Sure, you don't mind, right.
[01:42:47.140 --> 01:42:48.820]   And did that work Robert?
[01:42:48.820 --> 01:42:49.820]   When you were.
[01:42:49.820 --> 01:42:53.380]   You must at the time, you can talk people and then buying locally if it's not a ridiculous
[01:42:53.380 --> 01:42:54.380]   huge difference.
[01:42:54.380 --> 01:42:56.580]   You say things like you're going to have it today.
[01:42:56.580 --> 01:42:59.020]   If you have any problems, you need a little training.
[01:42:59.020 --> 01:43:00.020]   Come back to me.
[01:43:00.020 --> 01:43:01.100]   I'll show you how to use this.
[01:43:01.100 --> 01:43:02.340]   There are ways to solve this.
[01:43:02.340 --> 01:43:06.600]   I think sometimes the people who bitch about this are stores who don't want to give you
[01:43:06.600 --> 01:43:07.600]   good service.
[01:43:07.600 --> 01:43:08.600]   Absolutely.
[01:43:08.600 --> 01:43:09.600]   I look at my bookstore down the street.
[01:43:09.600 --> 01:43:13.240]   I want to buy my books from my independent bookstore because I love having them there.
[01:43:13.240 --> 01:43:15.960]   So I go down there and I say, "Can I need a book?
[01:43:15.960 --> 01:43:17.640]   Do you have it?"
[01:43:17.640 --> 01:43:18.640]   It takes them a while.
[01:43:18.640 --> 01:43:20.320]   They go, they look, they have their little database.
[01:43:20.320 --> 01:43:23.040]   They finally say, "No, but I can get it for you in three days."
[01:43:23.040 --> 01:43:24.040]   Right.
[01:43:24.040 --> 01:43:25.440]   It's like, "You know, where else I can get it in one day?"
[01:43:25.440 --> 01:43:26.840]   I can get it tomorrow, dude.
[01:43:26.840 --> 01:43:27.840]   Yeah.
[01:43:27.840 --> 01:43:31.880]   You've got to make it somehow better for me to come back here again and again.
[01:43:31.880 --> 01:43:32.880]   I want to support you.
[01:43:32.880 --> 01:43:33.880]   And again, matching that.
[01:43:33.880 --> 01:43:34.880]   Matching that.
[01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:35.880]   Yeah.
[01:43:35.880 --> 01:43:36.880]   My look.
[01:43:36.880 --> 01:43:37.880]   Go ahead Scott.
[01:43:37.880 --> 01:43:38.880]   Really expensive.
[01:43:38.880 --> 01:43:42.280]   They say, "All right, well, for me to get it to you next day as a local business, I'm
[01:43:42.280 --> 01:43:46.320]   already paying for the building, the employees, everything else we get to pay for.
[01:43:46.320 --> 01:43:49.600]   And I got to figure out a way to pay to get that book to you quicker and the book at
[01:43:49.600 --> 01:43:53.160]   a price that's reasonable enough for you to skip the online option."
[01:43:53.160 --> 01:43:57.160]   That's where the complaint is because that's so much more expensive to match all of that
[01:43:57.160 --> 01:43:59.920]   physically and locally than it is through a match.
[01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:01.760]   Yeah, but in this case, I wasn't price sensitive.
[01:44:01.760 --> 01:44:02.840]   I wanted the book.
[01:44:02.840 --> 01:44:04.160]   And I think this is often the case.
[01:44:04.160 --> 01:44:07.320]   If you go to a brick and mortar, you go not because you're price sensitive.
[01:44:07.320 --> 01:44:11.320]   If you're price sensitive, you can search online because you want it right away.
[01:44:11.320 --> 01:44:12.320]   You're willing to pay.
[01:44:12.320 --> 01:44:13.320]   What is it?
[01:44:13.320 --> 01:44:14.320]   It's two bucks or something.
[01:44:14.320 --> 01:44:15.320]   It's not a huge difference.
[01:44:15.320 --> 01:44:16.320]   Right.
[01:44:16.320 --> 01:44:17.320]   So it's not about price.
[01:44:17.320 --> 01:44:18.320]   It's a certain--
[01:44:18.320 --> 01:44:22.320]   My local bookstore, which is the oldest business in Halfman Bay, has diversified by selling cigars,
[01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:23.320]   for instance.
[01:44:23.320 --> 01:44:25.880]   And those are things that you don't really want to buy off online because you don't
[01:44:25.880 --> 01:44:27.960]   know the quality that you're getting.
[01:44:27.960 --> 01:44:32.920]   And he also does a lot of-- author readings and celebrity readings.
[01:44:32.920 --> 01:44:38.720]   And he has a lot of signed copies of books, and he's really expert at what's good.
[01:44:38.720 --> 01:44:39.720]   That's true.
[01:44:39.720 --> 01:44:45.000]   You go in there, you go, I'm thinking of a book for my wife that is sort of a fun read.
[01:44:45.000 --> 01:44:46.440]   And he'll have some suggestions.
[01:44:46.440 --> 01:44:48.080]   He's read them all.
[01:44:48.080 --> 01:44:51.160]   And that stuff you can't really get on Amazon.
[01:44:51.160 --> 01:44:56.560]   You can get the reviews and stuff, but it's not the same personal touch.
[01:44:56.560 --> 01:44:59.320]   But it's a tough business to be in retail.
[01:44:59.320 --> 01:45:04.320]   I think we all have sympathy for the individual who's running a store who feels squeezed by
[01:45:04.320 --> 01:45:05.320]   Amazon.
[01:45:05.320 --> 01:45:11.880]   But I don't have any sympathy for the lazy systems that are often behind these stores.
[01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:16.360]   It's like you should be more focused on adding value, and you should not be taking margins
[01:45:16.360 --> 01:45:17.360]   that are that large.
[01:45:17.360 --> 01:45:18.360]   And you've got to get closer.
[01:45:18.360 --> 01:45:22.520]   And again, I'm not saying that you have to match Amazon, but you've got to get closer
[01:45:22.520 --> 01:45:23.520]   to it.
[01:45:23.520 --> 01:45:25.160]   In my case, we've sold cameras.
[01:45:25.160 --> 01:45:27.880]   And cameras are a really funny business.
[01:45:27.880 --> 01:45:28.880]   This is the '80s.
[01:45:28.880 --> 01:45:31.120]   And it's still the same margins from what I hear.
[01:45:31.120 --> 01:45:32.120]   $1,400.
[01:45:32.120 --> 01:45:34.920]   Like we sold Nikon F4s.
[01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:36.520]   They were $1,400 back then.
[01:45:36.520 --> 01:45:37.920]   We would make $5 on the camera.
[01:45:37.920 --> 01:45:38.920]   All right.
[01:45:38.920 --> 01:45:41.120]   So there was no way to cut it too much lower.
[01:45:41.120 --> 01:45:42.120]   Right, sure.
[01:45:42.120 --> 01:45:45.480]   Now the online retailers can charge you a little bit more and play some games and sell
[01:45:45.480 --> 01:45:46.480]   you an extended warranty.
[01:45:46.480 --> 01:45:50.040]   This is why when you call up a lot of those places, they really, really spend a lot of
[01:45:50.040 --> 01:45:51.840]   time trying to get you to buy the extended warranty.
[01:45:51.840 --> 01:45:56.640]   Because if they can sell you an extended warranty for $60, that's probably $45 or $50
[01:45:56.640 --> 01:45:57.640]   profit.
[01:45:57.640 --> 01:46:01.640]   And then they can say, "Well, we'll sell you the camera for $20 less than you're paying
[01:46:01.640 --> 01:46:02.640]   locally."
[01:46:02.640 --> 01:46:03.640]   Right?
[01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:04.640]   There's a lot of games that go on.
[01:46:04.640 --> 01:46:05.640]   Right.
[01:46:05.640 --> 01:46:10.160]   And then I would make $5 on the camera, but I would make $18 on a $19 filter.
[01:46:10.160 --> 01:46:11.160]   Of course.
[01:46:11.160 --> 01:46:12.160]   And that's something that you don't know.
[01:46:12.160 --> 01:46:15.760]   I do want to point out that this is not something new.
[01:46:15.760 --> 01:46:19.120]   There is a Hebrew shopkeeper's law.
[01:46:19.120 --> 01:46:29.680]   This is a rabbinical law that it is against the law to waste a shopkeeper's time.
[01:46:29.680 --> 01:46:31.800]   They don't say, "Because you're going to buy on Amazon."
[01:46:31.800 --> 01:46:33.640]   They say, "Because you're waiting for a bus."
[01:46:33.640 --> 01:46:35.000]   Or you know, you're killing time.
[01:46:35.000 --> 01:46:39.920]   But it's against Hebrew law, spiritual law, to go and away somebody's time and not buy.
[01:46:39.920 --> 01:46:40.920]   Yeah.
[01:46:40.920 --> 01:46:41.920]   So that's interesting.
[01:46:41.920 --> 01:46:42.920]   Isn't that interesting?
[01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:43.920]   Yeah.
[01:46:43.920 --> 01:46:44.920]   I don't know why.
[01:46:44.920 --> 01:46:45.920]   So it is clearly an ethical violation.
[01:46:45.920 --> 01:46:46.920]   I mean, I wonder what--
[01:46:46.920 --> 01:46:50.560]   I wonder why-- and by the way, this is the new thing that I'm going to be big on.
[01:46:50.560 --> 01:46:52.600]   And Tim O'Reilly inspired me with this.
[01:46:52.600 --> 01:46:53.920]   This is your new cause.
[01:46:53.920 --> 01:46:54.920]   This is my new cause.
[01:46:54.920 --> 01:46:56.680]   It's not that particular, but this is my new cause.
[01:46:56.680 --> 01:46:59.560]   And it has to do with G+, as well.
[01:46:59.560 --> 01:47:01.200]   We keep saying, "Oh, there ought to be a law.
[01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:02.200]   There ought to be regulations."
[01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:04.200]   Instead of that, whatever happened to Zebu--
[01:47:04.200 --> 01:47:05.200]   Not me.
[01:47:05.200 --> 01:47:06.200]   Not me.
[01:47:06.200 --> 01:47:08.400]   I know you're not the guy you're a top-out libertarian.
[01:47:08.400 --> 01:47:11.000]   But all right, maybe I'm starting to become a little bit more like you.
[01:47:11.000 --> 01:47:13.000]   Right there you go, right there.
[01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:17.880]   But seriously, Tim O'Reilly said this, "Instead of getting all these privacy laws, what if
[01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:20.080]   instead-- we have privacy taboos.
[01:47:20.080 --> 01:47:23.720]   You're not-- it is illegal to technically look into somebody's window.
[01:47:23.720 --> 01:47:24.720]   Sure.
[01:47:24.720 --> 01:47:26.520]   But more so, we have the taboo about doing that.
[01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:29.320]   Or a lock really is going to stop many people.
[01:47:29.320 --> 01:47:30.320]   But it's a signal.
[01:47:30.320 --> 01:47:32.320]   No, your door was unlocked, by the way.
[01:47:32.320 --> 01:47:33.560]   But it's a signal.
[01:47:33.560 --> 01:47:36.720]   The fact that the door is there and the lock is there, even though anybody could easily
[01:47:36.720 --> 01:47:37.720]   penetrate it.
[01:47:37.720 --> 01:47:39.920]   It's a signal saying, "Don't come in.
[01:47:39.920 --> 01:47:41.640]   I want this to be private."
[01:47:41.640 --> 01:47:46.600]   And unfortunately, I think there's so many situations in our life now where these taboos
[01:47:46.600 --> 01:47:52.040]   or societal mores, we keep wanting to express them in regulation and law when, in fact,
[01:47:52.040 --> 01:47:57.360]   we really ought to be asserting them over and over, telling our kids, "It's not okay
[01:47:57.360 --> 01:47:58.960]   to waste the shopkeeper's time.
[01:47:58.960 --> 01:47:59.960]   That's unethical."
[01:47:59.960 --> 01:48:03.160]   And a lot of this has to do with accountability for being busted doing these things.
[01:48:03.160 --> 01:48:05.640]   And in an online space, we've enjoyed for about 20 years.
[01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:06.640]   Because we're anonymous.
[01:48:06.640 --> 01:48:07.880]   Complete anonymity.
[01:48:07.880 --> 01:48:11.800]   But it's things like the Google+ that is stripping that away.
[01:48:11.800 --> 01:48:16.160]   Let me tell you, the most freaked out moment I had was learning the real names and the
[01:48:16.160 --> 01:48:19.320]   real locations and the real jobs of half of my friends online.
[01:48:19.320 --> 01:48:20.880]   I'm like, "You're not demonized.
[01:48:20.880 --> 01:48:22.880]   I have moved."
[01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:24.440]   Yeah, right?
[01:48:24.440 --> 01:48:27.880]   I love the fact that G+ requires your person.
[01:48:27.880 --> 01:48:29.160]   It doesn't require it suggests.
[01:48:29.160 --> 01:48:30.160]   Yes.
[01:48:30.160 --> 01:48:32.160]   Because you can create a big personality.
[01:48:32.160 --> 01:48:35.520]   But you invest a lot of time and effort in building up this artificial person that
[01:48:35.520 --> 01:48:36.520]   you're pretending to be.
[01:48:36.520 --> 01:48:42.600]   Well, for instance, I thought for sure Mark Zuckerberg on Google+ was a phony Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:48:42.600 --> 01:48:43.600]   You know what?
[01:48:43.600 --> 01:48:44.600]   It ain't true.
[01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:45.600]   And you know how I know it?
[01:48:45.600 --> 01:48:46.600]   This guy right here.
[01:48:46.600 --> 01:48:47.600]   Yeah.
[01:48:47.600 --> 01:48:48.600]   Where should we text?
[01:48:48.600 --> 01:48:50.680]   You know Mark Zuckerberg well enough that you're getting texts from him.
[01:48:50.680 --> 01:48:51.680]   Let me show you the text.
[01:48:51.680 --> 01:48:52.680]   That's bizarre.
[01:48:52.680 --> 01:48:53.680]   I'm sorry.
[01:48:53.680 --> 01:48:55.040]   I got to go clean off my legs.
[01:48:55.040 --> 01:48:57.200]   Somebody dropped a whole bunch of names around here.
[01:48:57.200 --> 01:48:58.200]   Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:48:58.200 --> 01:48:59.200]   Can I show it?
[01:48:59.200 --> 01:49:00.200]   Can I show it?
[01:49:00.200 --> 01:49:01.200]   All right.
[01:49:01.200 --> 01:49:02.200]   Can I show it?
[01:49:02.200 --> 01:49:03.200]   I can show it.
[01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:04.200]   It's a phone number.
[01:49:04.200 --> 01:49:05.200]   Oh, yeah.
[01:49:05.200 --> 01:49:07.200]   I don't want to have a friend anymore.
[01:49:07.200 --> 01:49:09.640]   That's the best way to lose a friend.
[01:49:09.640 --> 01:49:11.800]   I don't think his phone number is visible in here.
[01:49:11.800 --> 01:49:17.680]   But you could see this is actually Mark Zuckerberg texting you and he's saying he's enjoying.
[01:49:17.680 --> 01:49:18.680]   He's saying.
[01:49:18.680 --> 01:49:19.680]   Okay.
[01:49:19.680 --> 01:49:23.760]   And in that text, by the way, is another piece that I didn't talk about.
[01:49:23.760 --> 01:49:27.400]   There's this company called Catango coming out in a few weeks.
[01:49:27.400 --> 01:49:28.400]   And it is mind blowing.
[01:49:28.400 --> 01:49:31.400]   Leo, are you scrolling back to the history of their conversation?
[01:49:31.400 --> 01:49:32.400]   I can't.
[01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:33.400]   I'm saying.
[01:49:33.400 --> 01:49:34.400]   What is Catango?
[01:49:34.400 --> 01:49:35.400]   Sorry.
[01:49:35.400 --> 01:49:37.120]   Cooking with friends now.
[01:49:37.120 --> 01:49:40.760]   By the way, when Mark Zuckerberg says he's cooking with friends, he's actually slaughtering
[01:49:40.760 --> 01:49:41.760]   the pig.
[01:49:41.760 --> 01:49:42.760]   He's cooking math.
[01:49:42.760 --> 01:49:43.760]   Finally.
[01:49:43.760 --> 01:49:45.520]   So he asked you about Catango.
[01:49:45.520 --> 01:49:47.680]   I got to get invited to one of those dinners.
[01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:48.680]   I have it.
[01:49:48.680 --> 01:49:49.680]   Nope kidding.
[01:49:49.680 --> 01:49:50.680]   I'm not that kind of good friend yet.
[01:49:50.680 --> 01:49:53.480]   I'm totally blown away by the fact that you've got a personal text from Mark Zuckerberg.
[01:49:53.480 --> 01:49:56.920]   But he did confirm that he is using Google+ and that.
[01:49:56.920 --> 01:49:59.200]   And you know, what else is using Google+ is Tom from MySpace.
[01:49:59.200 --> 01:50:00.200]   I guess I said Tom.
[01:50:00.200 --> 01:50:01.200]   Tom, I understand.
[01:50:01.200 --> 01:50:02.200]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:03.200]   All right.
[01:50:03.200 --> 01:50:04.200]   So here's my question about the Amazon thing.
[01:50:04.200 --> 01:50:05.200]   Oh, wait a minute.
[01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:07.000]   Now this is totally depressing.
[01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:08.000]   Okay, go on.
[01:50:08.000 --> 01:50:09.000]   I'm ready.
[01:50:09.000 --> 01:50:10.000]   Say that.
[01:50:10.000 --> 01:50:12.400]   We were talking about how Michael Dell's very accessible.
[01:50:12.400 --> 01:50:14.080]   Michael Dell just had to hang out.
[01:50:14.080 --> 01:50:16.200]   One person showed up with Chris Perillo.
[01:50:16.200 --> 01:50:17.200]   Chris Perillo.
[01:50:17.200 --> 01:50:19.040]   And nobody crashed that party.
[01:50:19.040 --> 01:50:20.040]   Unbelievable.
[01:50:20.040 --> 01:50:22.440]   Of course, it only a minute later it ended.
[01:50:22.440 --> 01:50:23.440]   Yeah.
[01:50:23.440 --> 01:50:24.440]   So.
[01:50:24.440 --> 01:50:28.880]   So Perillo showed up in your hangout when you end up.
[01:50:28.880 --> 01:50:30.440]   This is pretty amazing.
[01:50:30.440 --> 01:50:31.640]   Michael, this is Michael Dell.
[01:50:31.640 --> 01:50:32.640]   Hang on.
[01:50:32.640 --> 01:50:35.240]   So I think that's kind of interesting.
[01:50:35.240 --> 01:50:36.680]   So two questions here.
[01:50:36.680 --> 01:50:39.320]   First of all, who do you guys, if you're handicapping this thing, who's going to win
[01:50:39.320 --> 01:50:43.440]   in this face off, which is of course one of many between Amazon and California?
[01:50:43.440 --> 01:50:46.640]   Second question is, is there any state that has refused to back down?
[01:50:46.640 --> 01:50:50.800]   No, the government's a big loser here because they, this is such a stupid law that's going
[01:50:50.800 --> 01:50:54.520]   to cost them far more money than it's going to make them money.
[01:50:54.520 --> 01:50:58.400]   I mean, first of all, I was paying income tax on that $20,000 a year.
[01:50:58.400 --> 01:51:01.320]   So they were getting another four grand or five grand out of me.
[01:51:01.320 --> 01:51:06.680]   This is, this is the, the, the, the chicken s of being so good about not swearing.
[01:51:06.680 --> 01:51:11.080]   This is the chicken s way that the RIAA handled the MP3 problem is what they should have been
[01:51:11.080 --> 01:51:14.440]   doing is going after the people who were stealing music, but they don't want to do that because
[01:51:14.440 --> 01:51:16.400]   that's hard and there's going to be a big backlash.
[01:51:16.400 --> 01:51:19.760]   So instead they try to go after people who are distributing music and then things got
[01:51:19.760 --> 01:51:23.600]   complicated with BitTorrent, which of course, 10 year anniversary this, this month.
[01:51:23.600 --> 01:51:24.600]   Yeah.
[01:51:24.600 --> 01:51:28.520]   And then likewise, the government already has owed the money by the individuals.
[01:51:28.520 --> 01:51:32.260]   They should be, it's already in the law that they need to pay, but they don't want to
[01:51:32.260 --> 01:51:36.000]   go after the individuals because there will be a backlash from their constituents.
[01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:40.440]   So they're doing the chicken crap thing of going after Amazon because that's an easy
[01:51:40.440 --> 01:51:41.440]   thing to do.
[01:51:41.440 --> 01:51:42.440]   Right.
[01:51:42.440 --> 01:51:43.440]   Yeah.
[01:51:43.440 --> 01:51:46.200]   Well, on the other hand, Amazon knows very well what it's up to when it says, okay, well,
[01:51:46.200 --> 01:51:50.720]   we'll just tell our affiliates that they no longer welcome, which is good.
[01:51:50.720 --> 01:51:54.400]   I think I think this is off how many hundreds of thousands of that's a smart thing is that
[01:51:54.400 --> 01:51:57.040]   they preemptively struck and say we are ending it today.
[01:51:57.040 --> 01:51:58.040]   Yeah.
[01:51:58.040 --> 01:51:59.040]   And I'll get it out if you want attention.
[01:51:59.040 --> 01:52:00.040]   Yeah.
[01:52:00.040 --> 01:52:01.800]   Hey, we're running out of time.
[01:52:01.800 --> 01:52:05.640]   I know it's, you just stopped by briefly to say hi, Robert Scoble, but I got to thank
[01:52:05.640 --> 01:52:06.840]   you for bringing me some wine.
[01:52:06.840 --> 01:52:08.040]   It's bringing me this incredible wine.
[01:52:08.040 --> 01:52:09.040]   What was it again?
[01:52:09.040 --> 01:52:10.040]   Paradox.
[01:52:10.040 --> 01:52:11.040]   They're on Twitter, by the way.
[01:52:11.040 --> 01:52:12.040]   Para, P-A-R-A-D-U-X.
[01:52:12.040 --> 01:52:13.040]   D-U-X-X.
[01:52:13.040 --> 01:52:14.040]   X-X.
[01:52:14.040 --> 01:52:15.040]   Yeah, it's a nap.
[01:52:15.040 --> 01:52:16.040]   And it's delicious.
[01:52:16.040 --> 01:52:20.160]   You actually went on Google circles, Google Plus and said, what's a good napa of wine or
[01:52:20.160 --> 01:52:22.480]   why should I go there and did you get some good?
[01:52:22.480 --> 01:52:24.160]   Yeah, we went to Delgado this morning.
[01:52:24.160 --> 01:52:25.160]   It was awesome.
[01:52:25.160 --> 01:52:28.080]   And so the Vic is friends with the owner there.
[01:52:28.080 --> 01:52:31.600]   But that was based on what people have told you on Google Plus.
[01:52:31.600 --> 01:52:37.560]   Well, and Cora, there's a great question on Cora about wine and wineries.
[01:52:37.560 --> 01:52:39.200]   This is how I love social.
[01:52:39.200 --> 01:52:40.200]   Yeah.
[01:52:40.200 --> 01:52:42.480]   You really get some great information.
[01:52:42.480 --> 01:52:46.520]   And now that everybody's using their real names, you know who they are, what biases they
[01:52:46.520 --> 01:52:49.000]   bring to the table, what their authority level is.
[01:52:49.000 --> 01:52:52.560]   Now, Cora has a lot better idea of what their authority level is.
[01:52:52.560 --> 01:52:56.000]   Like I'm pre-high on authority on tech, but not very high on wine.
[01:52:56.000 --> 01:53:00.240]   If I write a wine answer, my answer will be way low on the page and it has to be voted
[01:53:00.240 --> 01:53:04.280]   up so the quality has to speak for itself.
[01:53:04.280 --> 01:53:09.320]   And this is stuff that I hope Google starts integrating into Google Plus because to tell
[01:53:09.320 --> 01:53:11.920]   you the truth, it's going to devolve into cat photos pretty quickly.
[01:53:11.920 --> 01:53:12.920]   It already has.
[01:53:12.920 --> 01:53:13.920]   It's disgusting.
[01:53:13.920 --> 01:53:18.760]   And there's no way to find what you really want.
[01:53:18.760 --> 01:53:23.480]   I think I have a circle of venture capitalists and none of them talk about venture capital.
[01:53:23.480 --> 01:53:26.080]   So I'm not getting what I really want out of that circle.
[01:53:26.080 --> 01:53:28.280]   But you can't force people to talk about what you want to talk about.
[01:53:28.280 --> 01:53:29.480]   No, but we need filters, right?
[01:53:29.480 --> 01:53:33.200]   So only show me items that say the word venture capital or fun.
[01:53:33.200 --> 01:53:34.720]   Well, I think that's going to be solved.
[01:53:34.720 --> 01:53:38.400]   That's going to be solved by hashtags and search, both of which are missing now, but
[01:53:38.400 --> 01:53:39.880]   we'll certainly be at it quickly.
[01:53:39.880 --> 01:53:43.640]   And also by just sheer volume of people joining the service once it's out of beta.
[01:53:43.640 --> 01:53:47.640]   Well, the problem is the masses are asses and the more people who come into the system
[01:53:47.640 --> 01:53:48.640]   if you don't.
[01:53:48.640 --> 01:53:52.400]   Oh my God, it's Katy Perry and Russell Brand.
[01:53:52.400 --> 01:53:56.640]   If you don't have filters and you don't have ways to protect yourself against the noise,
[01:53:56.640 --> 01:54:00.360]   it devolves into ICANN has cheeseburger, which is a great site.
[01:54:00.360 --> 01:54:03.840]   And by the way, Ben Hodge great on Google and he's doing a lot.
[01:54:03.840 --> 01:54:06.760]   Believe it or not, he's doing a lot of great stuff that has nothing to do.
[01:54:06.760 --> 01:54:07.760]   He's a smart guy.
[01:54:07.760 --> 01:54:08.760]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:54:08.760 --> 01:54:10.480]   You know, but that's in my entrepreneur.
[01:54:10.480 --> 01:54:11.480]   It's the same problem.
[01:54:11.480 --> 01:54:14.520]   If we all decide where we're going to go to dinner tonight, if I asked Leah, we might
[01:54:14.520 --> 01:54:18.760]   end up at some great sushi place or some great Thai place or something like that, if we
[01:54:18.760 --> 01:54:22.000]   ask all 10 people in the room, we're going to end up at McDonald's.
[01:54:22.000 --> 01:54:27.240]   No, but I think that's solvable by with, and I think circles does a very intelligent
[01:54:27.240 --> 01:54:30.760]   job of making the first, I think really good cut on this.
[01:54:30.760 --> 01:54:34.240]   It's going to be really interesting how they turn on certain features because the sparks,
[01:54:34.240 --> 01:54:38.800]   for instance, are the first example of what I'm talking about, where you can say, I want
[01:54:38.800 --> 01:54:39.800]   to watch the venture capital.
[01:54:39.800 --> 01:54:43.360]   So why don't we apply our circles to sparks and then we've got something?
[01:54:43.360 --> 01:54:44.360]   That's what I'm waiting for.
[01:54:44.360 --> 01:54:48.440]   And Google has to turn on some features and some search.
[01:54:48.440 --> 01:54:50.040]   Well, this is day five.
[01:54:50.040 --> 01:54:51.040]   Yeah, you know.
[01:54:51.040 --> 01:54:52.640]   Well, and plus we're still in closed beta.
[01:54:52.640 --> 01:54:56.240]   You got to remember it is a closed beta and that this is not a launched product.
[01:54:56.240 --> 01:55:00.080]   Yeah, but you know, they've had a while to think about this stuff and copy everybody
[01:55:00.080 --> 01:55:01.360]   else and really do some innovation.
[01:55:01.360 --> 01:55:02.480]   I don't think it's, I don't doubt that.
[01:55:02.480 --> 01:55:04.960]   I think they have a lot of features that they're going to slowly roll out.
[01:55:04.960 --> 01:55:05.960]   That's all there.
[01:55:05.960 --> 01:55:06.960]   This is early days.
[01:55:06.960 --> 01:55:09.280]   Scott Johnson, it's so great to have you here.
[01:55:09.280 --> 01:55:10.280]   Thank you so much for being here.
[01:55:10.280 --> 01:55:15.080]   The forecast is an amazing show, which everybody must listen to on the Twit Network, but it's
[01:55:15.080 --> 01:55:16.080]   not the only.
[01:55:16.080 --> 01:55:18.240]   Every Monday night we talk about the future.
[01:55:18.240 --> 01:55:19.600]   So much fun hanging out with Tom.
[01:55:19.600 --> 01:55:22.080]   Get the crazy prediction, I guess you've been on before.
[01:55:22.080 --> 01:55:23.080]   That was amazing.
[01:55:23.080 --> 01:55:24.080]   I had a great time.
[01:55:24.080 --> 01:55:25.080]   Yeah.
[01:55:25.080 --> 01:55:26.080]   I really enjoyed it.
[01:55:26.080 --> 01:55:27.080]   Of course, I appreciate that.
[01:55:27.080 --> 01:55:32.460]   Frog Pants Studios is the place to go to find out more about Scott's cartooning and his
[01:55:32.460 --> 01:55:33.460]   other shows.
[01:55:33.460 --> 01:55:34.460]   You do a lot of shows.
[01:55:34.460 --> 01:55:36.640]   There's a lot going on over there.
[01:55:36.640 --> 01:55:40.800]   I might put people's direction or their eyes to the morning show.
[01:55:40.800 --> 01:55:42.360]   We do Monday through Thursday on the network.
[01:55:42.360 --> 01:55:45.120]   It's at frogpants.com/tms.
[01:55:45.120 --> 01:55:48.200]   And every morning we do a morning show, all about pop, shoot the culture, a little bit
[01:55:48.200 --> 01:55:50.400]   of tech, video games, that kind of stuff.
[01:55:50.400 --> 01:55:54.000]   Just Robert Young comes on every Thursday and does a little weird wood segment.
[01:55:54.000 --> 01:55:55.920]   Tom comes on Wednesdays for a little bit of a little bit of geek.
[01:55:55.920 --> 01:55:57.480]   We have a lot of fun with that show.
[01:55:57.480 --> 01:55:59.280]   And I think people get a kick out of it.
[01:55:59.280 --> 01:56:06.280]   I haven't checked it out yet.
[01:56:06.280 --> 01:56:09.200]   Thanks to also Brian Brushwood, Schwood.com.
[01:56:09.200 --> 01:56:13.440]   He's also the host of Scam School on Revision 3 at our own show on this network.
[01:56:13.440 --> 01:56:14.440]   We're all kind of incensed.
[01:56:14.440 --> 01:56:20.320]   In SFW and I guess what, the new video game show that we're trying out on Friday.
[01:56:20.320 --> 01:56:23.520]   We should announce that at the controls is going to be starting as soon as we get into
[01:56:23.520 --> 01:56:25.120]   that new studio late July.
[01:56:25.120 --> 01:56:29.120]   Followed by live land gaming right here at the Twit Studio.
[01:56:29.120 --> 01:56:32.000]   We're going to do a land party, but only if you buy a brick.
[01:56:32.000 --> 01:56:33.000]   Oh, thank goodness.
[01:56:33.000 --> 01:56:34.000]   You fizzed it.
[01:56:34.000 --> 01:56:35.000]   You have to walk in with your car.
[01:56:35.000 --> 01:56:37.000]   I want to go see where my brick's going to be.
[01:56:37.000 --> 01:56:38.000]   Did you buy a brick?
[01:56:38.000 --> 01:56:39.000]   No, I'm going to buy one.
[01:56:39.000 --> 01:56:40.000]   I need to know where it's going to be.
[01:56:40.000 --> 01:56:41.000]   You're going to buy one.
[01:56:41.000 --> 01:56:42.000]   It says, "Build him 40.
[01:56:42.000 --> 01:56:43.000]   He puts 600 bones down.
[01:56:43.000 --> 01:56:44.000]   I want to know."
[01:56:44.000 --> 01:56:45.000]   Oh, you're going to get the big one.
[01:56:45.000 --> 01:56:46.000]   You're going to get the logo.
[01:56:46.000 --> 01:56:48.800]   I love the Build him 43 logo on it.
[01:56:48.800 --> 01:56:50.240]   That'll be awesome, Robert.
[01:56:50.240 --> 01:56:51.920]   Yeah, bricks.twit.tv.
[01:56:51.920 --> 01:56:56.400]   We are raising money because this studio is in fact costing almost a million dollars.
[01:56:56.400 --> 01:56:57.400]   We thought it'd be about 350,000.
[01:56:57.400 --> 01:56:58.400]   Wow.
[01:56:58.400 --> 01:56:59.400]   So these little gaps.
[01:56:59.400 --> 01:57:00.840]   They're just gone crazy, Leo.
[01:57:00.840 --> 01:57:01.840]   Wow.
[01:57:01.840 --> 01:57:02.840]   Just a little gap.
[01:57:02.840 --> 01:57:06.640]   But when you see the new studio, and you know, I had this, for some reason I think better
[01:57:06.640 --> 01:57:07.640]   in the shower.
[01:57:07.640 --> 01:57:10.200]   I think it's the warm water trickling down the cleft of my eye.
[01:57:10.200 --> 01:57:11.480]   I think it's the warm waddle.
[01:57:11.480 --> 01:57:12.480]   That trickles all over.
[01:57:12.480 --> 01:57:13.480]   I love her.
[01:57:13.480 --> 01:57:14.480]   I hate you.
[01:57:14.480 --> 01:57:18.720]   But I realized that I'm not, sometimes I think there might be some misunderstanding.
[01:57:18.720 --> 01:57:21.240]   People think, "Oh, you're building this studio because you want to get bigger."
[01:57:21.240 --> 01:57:22.240]   No.
[01:57:22.240 --> 01:57:23.240]   Or you want more audience.
[01:57:23.240 --> 01:57:24.240]   No.
[01:57:24.240 --> 01:57:25.240]   No.
[01:57:25.240 --> 01:57:26.960]   It's because I want to do a better job of what we do right now.
[01:57:26.960 --> 01:57:29.160]   I want to be able to do better.
[01:57:29.160 --> 01:57:32.080]   Everything about Twit can remain exactly the same.
[01:57:32.080 --> 01:57:33.080]   But better.
[01:57:33.080 --> 01:57:34.560]   With a deeper involvement in 24/7.
[01:57:34.560 --> 01:57:36.640]   Well, the land party's a good example.
[01:57:36.640 --> 01:57:38.160]   We couldn't do a land party in here.
[01:57:38.160 --> 01:57:39.160]   No.
[01:57:39.160 --> 01:57:40.160]   But we have a nice big--
[01:57:40.160 --> 01:57:41.160]   We can't.
[01:57:41.160 --> 01:57:42.920]   Look, we can do what Robert Herron in here.
[01:57:42.920 --> 01:57:43.920]   He shows there.
[01:57:43.920 --> 01:57:44.920]   Sorry, I'm sorry.
[01:57:44.920 --> 01:57:45.920]   Scoble.
[01:57:45.920 --> 01:57:46.920]   People don't know if they don't come here.
[01:57:46.920 --> 01:57:47.920]   You've got employees all over the place.
[01:57:47.920 --> 01:57:48.920]   They have 17 people.
[01:57:48.920 --> 01:57:49.920]   18 people.
[01:57:49.920 --> 01:57:50.920]   There's plenty of here.
[01:57:50.920 --> 01:57:52.840]   Yeah, there's about one, two, three, four, five.
[01:57:52.840 --> 01:57:54.320]   There's people in the living room.
[01:57:54.320 --> 01:57:55.320]   Yeah.
[01:57:55.320 --> 01:57:56.320]   People everywhere.
[01:57:56.320 --> 01:57:57.400]   We're strewn all about.
[01:57:57.400 --> 01:58:01.280]   This is a physical manifestation of the clubhouse mentality of Twit.
[01:58:01.280 --> 01:58:02.760]   Twit is an interactive experience.
[01:58:02.760 --> 01:58:04.320]   Just building a nicer clubhouse.
[01:58:04.320 --> 01:58:05.320]   Absolutely.
[01:58:05.320 --> 01:58:06.320]   That's all we're doing.
[01:58:06.320 --> 01:58:07.320]   Well, physically and visually.
[01:58:07.320 --> 01:58:11.600]   We're not out to rule the world or to grow in a huge way.
[01:58:11.600 --> 01:58:13.720]   We just want to be able to do a better job of what we already do.
[01:58:13.720 --> 01:58:17.360]   So your support at brick.twit.tv is much appreciated.
[01:58:17.360 --> 01:58:18.360]   We are planning.
[01:58:18.360 --> 01:58:20.280]   This countdown is now on.
[01:58:20.280 --> 01:58:24.040]   There are two more Twits after this that we'll do from the cottage.
[01:58:24.040 --> 01:58:25.040]   Oh, man.
[01:58:25.040 --> 01:58:29.800]   On July 24th, it is my plan to pick up my ball.
[01:58:29.800 --> 01:58:30.800]   Pick up my ball.
[01:58:30.800 --> 01:58:31.800]   And go home.
[01:58:31.800 --> 01:58:32.800]   I'm taking my ball.
[01:58:32.800 --> 01:58:35.240]   I'm going to pick up my ball.
[01:58:35.240 --> 01:58:38.480]   After the tech guy on Sunday, July 24th, walk down the street.
[01:58:38.480 --> 01:58:39.480]   Just dumb mini parade.
[01:58:39.480 --> 01:58:41.400]   Just promise you he'll bounce all the way down.
[01:58:41.400 --> 01:58:42.400]   I will.
[01:58:42.400 --> 01:58:43.400]   I will.
[01:58:43.400 --> 01:58:47.680]   And then we will start the first broadcast day on July 24th.
[01:58:47.680 --> 01:58:49.280]   You can be a part of that.
[01:58:49.280 --> 01:58:52.800]   We will have room for 50 people in that audience, that studio audience.
[01:58:52.800 --> 01:58:54.560]   12 of you can sit on balls.
[01:58:54.560 --> 01:58:56.240]   Two of you can sit on sumo bean bags.
[01:58:56.240 --> 01:58:57.400]   The rest will have to sit on chairs.
[01:58:57.400 --> 01:58:58.400]   I'm sorry.
[01:58:58.400 --> 01:58:59.400]   What's the date again?
[01:58:59.400 --> 01:59:00.400]   July 24th, Sunday.
[01:59:00.400 --> 01:59:02.640]   Can I fly out and join you?
[01:59:02.640 --> 01:59:04.680]   Yeah, but there's more.
[01:59:04.680 --> 01:59:05.680]   Okay.
[01:59:05.680 --> 01:59:06.680]   But wait.
[01:59:06.680 --> 01:59:10.240]   So you got to email my sister because we have to keep track of how many people.
[01:59:10.240 --> 01:59:12.480]   I don't want a lot of people to turn down.
[01:59:12.480 --> 01:59:15.040]   So Eva, EVA at Twit.tv.
[01:59:15.040 --> 01:59:18.040]   If you'd like to be here for the 24th, we're going to have.
[01:59:18.040 --> 01:59:19.040]   She's already full.
[01:59:19.040 --> 01:59:20.040]   She's already full.
[01:59:20.040 --> 01:59:21.040]   Tony and it is out.
[01:59:21.040 --> 01:59:24.040]   We're going to keep those chairs.
[01:59:24.040 --> 01:59:26.040]   We went to party rent.
[01:59:26.040 --> 01:59:27.040]   So we've got 50 chairs.
[01:59:27.040 --> 01:59:29.280]   We're going to keep those seats in the studio for a week.
[01:59:29.280 --> 01:59:31.040]   So be part of the first week.
[01:59:31.040 --> 01:59:32.040]   Eva will explain this to you.
[01:59:32.040 --> 01:59:33.040]   You can be part of the movie.
[01:59:33.040 --> 01:59:34.040]   I think I'm watching mine off on eBay.
[01:59:34.040 --> 01:59:38.040]   I bet I'm going to get $2000 for my seat.
[01:59:38.040 --> 01:59:41.040]   But then, okay, that's the first shows.
[01:59:41.040 --> 01:59:43.840]   But then we're actually going to have a grand opening party.
[01:59:43.840 --> 01:59:46.840]   And that I'd like you to come to August 21st, if you can.
[01:59:46.840 --> 01:59:47.840]   If I can.
[01:59:47.840 --> 01:59:49.840]   That's usually the busiest time for back to school.
[01:59:49.840 --> 01:59:51.840]   The college shows, of course, is my day job.
[01:59:51.840 --> 01:59:53.840]   But, you know, look, if it's open, I'm coming.
[01:59:53.840 --> 01:59:54.840]   Anytime you're always welcome.
[01:59:54.840 --> 01:59:58.840]   August 21st, we will have studio open during the day on that Sunday.
[01:59:58.840 --> 02:00:02.840]   And then we're going to close it down to 7pm for an invite-only party with all of our hosts.
[02:00:02.840 --> 02:00:03.840]   But of course, you're invited, Robert.
[02:00:03.840 --> 02:00:04.840]   Awesome.
[02:00:04.840 --> 02:00:05.840]   All of us.
[02:00:05.840 --> 02:00:06.840]   And Scott, you're invited as well.
[02:00:06.840 --> 02:00:07.840]   I crash it even if you didn't.
[02:00:07.840 --> 02:00:08.840]   You have to.
[02:00:08.840 --> 02:00:09.840]   You have to.
[02:00:09.840 --> 02:00:10.840]   I know your front door is open.
[02:00:10.840 --> 02:00:11.840]   Yeah.
[02:00:11.840 --> 02:00:15.440]   And that's going to be fun because we're going to do a long broadcast with all of our hosts
[02:00:15.440 --> 02:00:16.440]   will be after that.
[02:00:16.440 --> 02:00:17.440]   So that'll be a lot of fun.
[02:00:17.440 --> 02:00:19.040]   That's August 21st for the grand opening party.
[02:00:19.040 --> 02:00:20.200]   And I do thank all of you.
[02:00:20.200 --> 02:00:22.040]   I know we've sold almost a thousand bricks now.
[02:00:22.040 --> 02:00:24.480]   We hope to sell another thousand if we can.
[02:00:24.480 --> 02:00:27.600]   But I think with the thousand of you who bought bricks at bricks.twit.tv because it really
[02:00:27.600 --> 02:00:28.600]   helped a lot.
[02:00:28.600 --> 02:00:29.600]   That is huge.
[02:00:29.600 --> 02:00:33.840]   We found out, well, we're learning more and more about things that we still need to buy.
[02:00:33.840 --> 02:00:41.800]   30 cameras in there, 40 lighting fixtures, a $50,000 switcher, a $30,000 audio switch.
[02:00:41.800 --> 02:00:42.800]   It just goes on and on.
[02:00:42.800 --> 02:00:44.760]   So it's very expensive.
[02:00:44.760 --> 02:00:49.280]   It's all to one goal, which is to provide you with better programming and the making.
[02:00:49.280 --> 02:00:50.920]   And you're in the final stretch of people.
[02:00:50.920 --> 02:00:53.280]   People can see it still being constructed at what?
[02:00:53.280 --> 02:00:54.280]   Bitly slash.
[02:00:54.280 --> 02:00:55.280]   Twit drop.
[02:00:55.280 --> 02:00:56.280]   Twit drop.
[02:00:56.280 --> 02:00:57.280]   To see the drop.
[02:00:57.280 --> 02:00:59.600]   It looks good because we're now actually putting in the lights and cameras.
[02:00:59.600 --> 02:01:01.400]   The furniture is in there.
[02:01:01.400 --> 02:01:02.400]   So we will.
[02:01:02.400 --> 02:01:04.120]   It is starting to look kind of interesting.
[02:01:04.120 --> 02:01:06.920]   If you go there, you can see where we stand right now.
[02:01:06.920 --> 02:01:09.000]   This is the new Twit round table.
[02:01:09.000 --> 02:01:10.000]   Looks so good.
[02:01:10.000 --> 02:01:12.800]   Brent By is there right now from OceanStudio.com.
[02:01:12.800 --> 02:01:15.080]   He's up on the ladder putting in lights.
[02:01:15.080 --> 02:01:16.080]   There he is.
[02:01:16.080 --> 02:01:20.440]   He's going down now.
[02:01:20.440 --> 02:01:21.440]   It's very exciting.
[02:01:21.440 --> 02:01:22.440]   I'm really stoked.
[02:01:22.440 --> 02:01:23.440]   Who else is there?
[02:01:23.440 --> 02:01:25.600]   Oh, there's Russell Tammany.
[02:01:25.600 --> 02:01:26.840]   He's our IT guy.
[02:01:26.840 --> 02:01:28.880]   He's putting in the switches.
[02:01:28.880 --> 02:01:31.440]   We've got about, I don't know, how many Dell switches we've got in there.
[02:01:31.440 --> 02:01:35.680]   I love the fact that all the wires go to that giant 10,000 square feet you have underground
[02:01:35.680 --> 02:01:36.680]   there.
[02:01:36.680 --> 02:01:37.680]   Well, this is the beauty of it.
[02:01:37.680 --> 02:01:38.680]   All the wires go through holes in the floor.
[02:01:38.680 --> 02:01:42.080]   These are control room and they go right down through the bottom there and all the stuff
[02:01:42.080 --> 02:01:43.840]   is in a rack in the basement.
[02:01:43.840 --> 02:01:48.200]   So it's cool, dry and quiet in the main studio.
[02:01:48.200 --> 02:01:50.120]   So we're very excited.
[02:01:50.120 --> 02:01:53.200]   It's really going to let us do things like your new show at the controls.
[02:01:53.200 --> 02:01:54.200]   Absolutely.
[02:01:54.200 --> 02:01:57.040]   So since we're doing plugs, I do have one more question before we wrap up.
[02:01:57.040 --> 02:02:02.280]   On Google+, are you even concerned about how many people follow you on Google+, or are you
[02:02:02.280 --> 02:02:05.040]   just excited because this is your ability to experience?
[02:02:05.040 --> 02:02:08.640]   The only time I got concerned is when Robert left me off his list of the top 10 Google
[02:02:08.640 --> 02:02:09.640]  + users.
[02:02:09.640 --> 02:02:10.640]   That's okay, Robert.
[02:02:10.640 --> 02:02:11.640]   No, no, that wasn't my list.
[02:02:11.640 --> 02:02:15.680]   That was somebody else's that I shared and then I made sure that they put you on.
[02:02:15.680 --> 02:02:16.680]   That's all right.
[02:02:16.680 --> 02:02:17.680]   I am not really particularly following it.
[02:02:17.680 --> 02:02:21.480]   Well, I am not because I want everybody to follow me on Google+.
[02:02:21.480 --> 02:02:24.320]   So it's Brian with an eye and brush would spell the way it sounds.
[02:02:24.320 --> 02:02:25.320]   Well, that's the thing.
[02:02:25.320 --> 02:02:26.320]   It's your real name.
[02:02:26.320 --> 02:02:27.320]   Yeah.
[02:02:27.320 --> 02:02:31.840]   So you can't find me on Google+, you're not trying very hard.
[02:02:31.840 --> 02:02:33.160]   But we should say this.
[02:02:33.160 --> 02:02:34.320]   We don't have any invitations.
[02:02:34.320 --> 02:02:36.040]   They closed invitations down.
[02:02:36.040 --> 02:02:37.640]   I hope they'll open it up soon.
[02:02:37.640 --> 02:02:41.440]   I have unlimited invitations, but you have to ask me.
[02:02:41.440 --> 02:02:43.240]   You have to follow me on Twitter to get any of the...
[02:02:43.240 --> 02:02:44.240]   No, I'm teasing.
[02:02:44.240 --> 02:02:45.240]   I've got nothing.
[02:02:45.240 --> 02:02:46.920]   Actually, I'm going to go home and answer my email.
[02:02:46.920 --> 02:02:49.680]   I have hundreds of emails from people asking me for advice.
[02:02:49.680 --> 02:02:50.680]   Yeah, don't.
[02:02:50.680 --> 02:02:51.680]   Please don't.
[02:02:51.680 --> 02:02:52.680]   There's no...
[02:02:52.680 --> 02:02:53.680]   I can't deal with them all.
[02:02:53.680 --> 02:02:54.680]   Sorry.
[02:02:54.680 --> 02:02:55.680]   You don't have invitations?
[02:02:55.680 --> 02:02:56.680]   There's a secret backdoor.
[02:02:56.680 --> 02:02:57.680]   No, I think that's closed.
[02:02:57.680 --> 02:02:58.680]   Oh, do they close it?
[02:02:58.680 --> 02:02:59.680]   Yeah, email the email backdoor.
[02:02:59.680 --> 02:03:00.680]   I think that's closed.
[02:03:00.680 --> 02:03:01.680]   Yeah, they close it again.
[02:03:01.680 --> 02:03:02.680]   Okay.
[02:03:02.680 --> 02:03:03.680]   Because sometimes they open it up for a little while.
[02:03:03.680 --> 02:03:05.520]   Well, that's the thing is, yeah, it's opening and closing.
[02:03:05.520 --> 02:03:10.960]   I bet tomorrow or Tuesday when everybody gets back to work at Google and after the holiday
[02:03:10.960 --> 02:03:12.880]   weekend I bet they open back up.
[02:03:12.880 --> 02:03:14.960]   They just want to make sure the servers don't know about it.
[02:03:14.960 --> 02:03:16.120]   It's been pretty solid.
[02:03:16.120 --> 02:03:17.120]   It's very fast.
[02:03:17.120 --> 02:03:18.120]   Yeah.
[02:03:18.120 --> 02:03:19.120]   Very fast.
[02:03:19.120 --> 02:03:20.120]   And the notifications are really nice.
[02:03:20.120 --> 02:03:21.120]   I like the...
[02:03:21.120 --> 02:03:22.640]   I actually like the web app a lot.
[02:03:22.640 --> 02:03:25.840]   It has some problems, but for a first try, it's pretty cool.
[02:03:25.840 --> 02:03:27.080]   I can't wait for the app.
[02:03:27.080 --> 02:03:28.320]   We thank you all for being here.
[02:03:28.320 --> 02:03:31.320]   We hope you'll come back and join us again next Sunday, 3 p.m.
[02:03:31.320 --> 02:03:35.320]   Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern at live.twit.tv.
[02:03:35.320 --> 02:03:38.600]   And then there's two more Sundays left and then we'll be in a brand new facility which
[02:03:38.600 --> 02:03:40.000]   will not look the same.
[02:03:40.000 --> 02:03:42.880]   And if it does, I'll give your brick back.
[02:03:42.880 --> 02:03:43.880]   Two weeks...
[02:03:43.880 --> 02:03:46.000]   Wait, so that means next week is the penultimate episode.
[02:03:46.000 --> 02:03:47.000]   That's right.
[02:03:47.000 --> 02:03:48.000]   Wow.
[02:03:48.000 --> 02:03:49.000]   And then the week after is the ultimate episode.
[02:03:49.000 --> 02:03:50.000]   Yeah.
[02:03:50.000 --> 02:03:51.000]   And then...
[02:03:51.000 --> 02:03:53.000]   And then it's the even more ultimate, awesome episode.
[02:03:53.000 --> 02:03:54.000]   The first episode, the beginning.
[02:03:54.000 --> 02:03:55.000]   The first, the beginning.
[02:03:55.000 --> 02:03:56.000]   Yeah.
[02:03:56.000 --> 02:04:00.160]   Although, I gotta say, Justin Robert Young is actually officially the first person to broadcast
[02:04:00.160 --> 02:04:01.160]   in the first studio.
[02:04:01.160 --> 02:04:03.520]   Can I ask you whether or not you were annoyed by that or not?
[02:04:03.520 --> 02:04:07.600]   Because I heard, because I heard the way I heard it was you walked in and you were like,
[02:04:07.600 --> 02:04:08.600]   "Oh, so, um..."
[02:04:08.600 --> 02:04:11.520]   So you're the first broadcast from the Twitch Studio.
[02:04:11.520 --> 02:04:13.440]   It was like...
[02:04:13.440 --> 02:04:14.440]   Okay.
[02:04:14.440 --> 02:04:20.000]   I guess you'll be the footnote in the trivia question.
[02:04:20.000 --> 02:04:23.080]   When they ask, "What was the first show done out of the Twitch studios?"
[02:04:23.080 --> 02:04:24.580]   And we say, "Okay, what?"
[02:04:24.580 --> 02:04:26.360]   Some Skype call from some guy named...
[02:04:26.360 --> 02:04:28.160]   I don't know, Jerry Robert Young.
[02:04:28.160 --> 02:04:31.520]   But if you're going to do that, then you also have to count all the times you cut over
[02:04:31.520 --> 02:04:32.520]   to the drop cam.
[02:04:32.520 --> 02:04:33.520]   It's not the same.
[02:04:33.520 --> 02:04:35.520]   Yeah, the whole show there.
[02:04:35.520 --> 02:04:36.520]   Well, uh, okay.
[02:04:36.520 --> 02:04:37.520]   It's the same.
[02:04:37.520 --> 02:04:41.520]   It's not the Twitch studio until you're in there.
[02:04:41.520 --> 02:04:42.520]   There you go.
[02:04:42.520 --> 02:04:43.520]   Thank you.
[02:04:43.520 --> 02:04:44.520]   So much.
[02:04:44.520 --> 02:04:45.520]   I love my balls and I like that.
[02:04:45.520 --> 02:04:46.520]   It is not the real deal.
[02:04:46.520 --> 02:04:47.520]   Thank you everybody for being here.
[02:04:47.520 --> 02:04:48.520]   We'll see you next week.
[02:04:48.520 --> 02:04:49.520]   Another Twitch.
[02:04:49.520 --> 02:04:50.520]   It's in the can.
[02:04:50.520 --> 02:04:51.520]   Bye-bye, everybody.
[02:04:51.520 --> 02:04:59.520]   Bye-bye.
[02:04:59.520 --> 02:05:00.360]   Alright.
