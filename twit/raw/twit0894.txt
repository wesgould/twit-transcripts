[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.320]   It's time for Twit this week in tech.
[00:00:01.320 --> 00:00:02.480]   Wow, do we have a great show?
[00:00:02.480 --> 00:00:04.880]   Shelly Brisbane, a newbie joins us,
[00:00:04.880 --> 00:00:06.720]   but she's gonna be great.
[00:00:06.720 --> 00:00:10.520]   Lisa Schmeiser's here, Larry Maggot, a long time friend.
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:12.000]   I've got the new Apple Watch Ultra.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.520]   We'll talk a little bit about that.
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:18.880]   The serial podcast claims its victory,
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.920]   and Nike will chicken.
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:24.040]   Why the FDA probably should not have said anything about it.
[00:00:24.040 --> 00:00:26.160]   It's all coming up next on Twit.
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.680]   The podcast you love.

[00:02:09.880 --> 00:02:17.800]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech,
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:20.800]   the show we cover the latest Tech News,
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:24.640]   with a panel of Tech-Aware reporters, people
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:27.400]   with their fingers on the pulse of tech,
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:29.800]   people like Larry Maggett, president and CEO
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.040]   of Connects Safely.org.
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:32.400]   Hello, Larry!
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.560]   Hello, Leo, how are you?
[00:02:33.560 --> 00:02:35.920]   What the hell happened to your mustache?
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:38.160]   Oh, yeah, well, it's a very long story,
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:41.440]   but I'll make it right before I was diagnosed with sleep apnea.
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:41.840]   Yeah.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.640]   And one of the things they told me I should do,
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:47.400]   or not the doctors, but the internet told me I should do,
[00:02:47.400 --> 00:02:48.840]   is to put tape over my mouth.
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.200]   Yeah, I do the tape in.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.320]   Yeah, well, yeah, you did.
[00:02:51.320 --> 00:02:53.000]   Well, the tape didn't stick to the mustache.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:54.040]   No, it won't.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:56.240]   So it turns out the tape doesn't help me anyway.
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.040]   So you still do do that.
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:00.400]   I did it because I read a book called "Breath, A Breath."
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:01.120]   Yes.
[00:03:01.120 --> 00:03:02.280]   Right, that's the book I read.
[00:03:02.280 --> 00:03:06.440]   Yeah, and that was a odd book.
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:07.480]   Yeah, right.
[00:03:07.480 --> 00:03:09.640]   But his premise is, in a nutshell,
[00:03:09.640 --> 00:03:11.560]   breathe through your nose, not your mouth.
[00:03:11.560 --> 00:03:12.080]   Right.
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.800]   Because your nose is filtering and air conditioning and stuff.
[00:03:16.800 --> 00:03:18.120]   And if you breathe through your mouth,
[00:03:18.120 --> 00:03:22.120]   this is-- he says the mouth is a backup for an emergency.
[00:03:22.120 --> 00:03:23.200]   You shouldn't be using.
[00:03:23.200 --> 00:03:25.120]   So if you've kind of got it getting a habit of breathing
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.520]   through your nose, but the problem is at night,
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.880]   you're asleep, you're unconscious.
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:31.720]   So you just use-- I use a little 3M surgical tape.
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:32.600]   And it's like a little--
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:33.440]   Well, it's a mustache.
[00:03:33.440 --> 00:03:34.280]   It's more challenging.
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:35.840]   Yeah, well, somebody-- actually, somebody--
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:37.320]   I'll find this for you.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.120]   Somebody in our Discord, our Club Twitch chat,
[00:03:40.120 --> 00:03:42.480]   sent me one for people with beards.
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:42.840]   Oh, right.
[00:03:42.840 --> 00:03:43.720]   A lot more expensive.
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:46.280]   But if you want to grow the mustache back,
[00:03:46.280 --> 00:03:47.680]   I bet your wife's happy.
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.520]   I stopped the tape and kept the mustache off.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:51.560]   Did you say, who are you, stranger?
[00:03:51.560 --> 00:03:52.960]   Well, people say, I look younger.
[00:03:52.960 --> 00:03:54.360]   I don't think it's necessarily true.
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:56.600]   But if anybody wants to give me any compliments,
[00:03:56.600 --> 00:03:58.760]   I'll take them.
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.400]   You actually look like George Goble.
[00:04:00.400 --> 00:04:03.560]   But I won't rub that in.
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.120]   Oh, good.
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:05.400]   Do you know anything on Hollywood Square?
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:06.160]   Yeah.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.480]   We should rearrange the monobies.
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:10.680]   Tell me if he does not look--
[00:04:10.680 --> 00:04:13.000]   I'm going to show you a picture of George Goble.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.400]   Tell me if he does not look like George Goble.
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:15.760]   Yeah.
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:16.240]   Oh, no.
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:20.320]   No, that's OK.
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.840]   You don't have to overlay the two.
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:22.720]   Let's stop here.
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:24.360]   Run my day.
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.960]   Oh, he's cute.
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:27.200]   Anyway, great to have you.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.640]   Thank you so much for being here.
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:30.320]   Also with us, I haven't seen you in ages.
[00:04:30.320 --> 00:04:34.680]   Lisa Schmeiser, she's got a new job, editor in chief of Nojitter.
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:35.360]   Hi, Lisa.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:35.920]   Hi, there.
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:37.080]   In the studio.
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.440]   It's so great to be back in the studio.
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:39.920]   Nice.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.560]   I'm so happy to see everybody in person here, too.
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:44.200]   I've missed the crew.
[00:04:44.200 --> 00:04:45.960]   The only reason I allowed you to come in studios,
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:48.000]   I thought you would be Girl Scout cookies.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.520]   That will be Q1, 20, 30.
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.040]   Apparently it's the wrong time of year.
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:51.560]   Yeah.
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.440]   Well, we're selling nuts starting in October 1st,
[00:04:54.440 --> 00:04:55.080]   but not quite the same.
[00:04:55.080 --> 00:04:56.520]   You could bring in Girl Scout nuts.
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:57.080]   Yeah.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:58.080]   Well, they do this year.
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:04:59.680]   It's different than that.
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:00.360]   Come out right.
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:02.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.080]   Sorry.
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:04.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:04.080 --> 00:05:05.080]   It's really exciting.
[00:05:05.080 --> 00:05:06.080]   It's certainly--
[00:05:06.080 --> 00:05:06.960]   Hey, it could be worse.
[00:05:06.960 --> 00:05:08.080]   It could have been Boy Scout nuts.
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.560]   And then you'd really long.
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:10.920]   We'd have to stop the show and start over.
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:11.760]   I believe it happens.
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:13.360]   It's called the BSA.
[00:05:13.360 --> 00:05:13.880]   No, I'm just--
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.520]   We were talking earlier about the FCC practices.
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:21.080]   We need to worry about that on the show.
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:22.600]   Also, anyway, great to have you.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:24.640]   Also, somebody who's never appeared on Twitter before,
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:26.440]   but has been a part of our shows for a long time.
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:27.880]   Gelly Brisbane is here.
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:28.960]   You know her.
[00:05:28.960 --> 00:05:32.680]   I know from sixcolors.com and Relay FM.
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:35.480]   She is a producer and reporter for Texas, the Texas--
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.800]   is it the Texas standard?
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:37.840]   I think it is.
[00:05:37.840 --> 00:05:40.080]   We answer to either, but it is the Texas standard.
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:43.560]   The national news show of Texas, we like to say.
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:44.920]   That's very Texan, isn't it?
[00:05:44.920 --> 00:05:45.960]   It's very Texan.
[00:05:45.960 --> 00:05:48.880]   I get invented, but it is absolutely on brand.
[00:05:48.880 --> 00:05:50.760]   I put it in my signature for that reason.
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:52.920]   The national news show for Texas.
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:54.840]   People read my emails when I say that in the bottom.
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:56.920]   That is hysterical.
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:00.480]   Is it a newspaper or is it just a website now?
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:01.920]   No, it's a radio show.
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.440]   It's a public radio show hosted at KET, Public Radio in Austin.
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:08.560]   We are on 30 stations across the state of Texas.
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.080]   We do have a website, which I ran for about five years.
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.560]   I no longer do that.
[00:06:12.560 --> 00:06:13.640]   And we're podcasts.
[00:06:13.640 --> 00:06:15.520]   So if you're interested in the news of Texas,
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.240]   Texas standard.org is where it's at.
[00:06:17.240 --> 00:06:19.800]   I think there's been a lot of news from Texas, of late.
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:20.800]   A little bit, yes.
[00:06:20.800 --> 00:06:21.800]   It's getting a sense.
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:22.800]   It's getting a bit of a busy down there.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:23.800]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:26.120]   Well, I'm glad you're busing your news up to the north now.
[00:06:26.120 --> 00:06:27.120]   That's great.
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:28.120]   Texan.
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:29.120]   You're flying up.
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:30.120]   Kidding.
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.120]   Kidding.
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:32.120]   Texas standard.org.
[00:06:32.120 --> 00:06:34.960]   Oh my God, I'm going to stay out of that.
[00:06:34.960 --> 00:06:36.960]   I'm not saying.
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:38.960]   Kidding.
[00:06:38.960 --> 00:06:43.960]   And just to let you know, because I think it's important that you know that Shelly does
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:49.560]   a lot of accessibility stuff because she is, she has low vision, which is a great thing
[00:06:49.560 --> 00:06:53.360]   for us to have because a lot of times we try to talk about accessibility without any
[00:06:53.360 --> 00:06:58.480]   experience of what it's like to try to use technology with a disability.
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.840]   So I'm really glad to have you on for that reason as well.
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:01.840]   Thank you.
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:02.840]   I'm glad to be here.
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:03.840]   Yeah.
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.440]   And you have actually how many books on this issue?
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:10.000]   Well, this is the 10th anniversary of a book I write called iOS Access for All.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.480]   And I do that book each year with the new iOS.
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:16.600]   So I'm magic frantically working on the iOS 16 edition.
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:19.800]   I've written a whole bunch of other books just on tech generally and specifically Mac
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:20.800]   stuff.
[00:07:20.800 --> 00:07:25.400]   But for the past 10 years, my project has been this giant comprehensive guide to accessibility
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:27.000]   for iOS folks.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.720]   That must be a nightmare every time I know I always comes out.
[00:07:29.720 --> 00:07:30.720]   That's a lot.
[00:07:30.720 --> 00:07:34.240]   I mean, nightmares is the way I want to say it on Twitter and then a way no, I want people
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:36.520]   to buy the book, you know, be excited about it.
[00:07:36.520 --> 00:07:38.320]   It's a joyous effort.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:40.360]   It's a delightful thing.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:41.840]   Every time Apple adds new features.
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:43.800]   I'm like, yeah, bring them on.
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:48.840]   My sense is though, Apple has paid a lot of attention to accessibility in iOS is probably
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:52.080]   the premier platform, mobile platform for accessibility.
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:53.080]   Yes.
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:54.080]   Yeah, it is.
[00:07:54.080 --> 00:07:57.160]   I think other platforms are coming along.
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:01.080]   And I also think that there is a tendency when I say things like that, that Apple is
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:02.840]   the leader for everybody to think, well, it's okay.
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:03.840]   They're done.
[00:08:03.840 --> 00:08:05.440]   It's completed, but that's not the case.
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.720]   They're obviously things that need to be improved.
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:10.640]   And then there are things that come along every year that delight and surprise us, which
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:12.440]   is what Apple wants to do.
[00:08:12.440 --> 00:08:19.160]   So it's an adventure because I do try to say to people, it's not done.
[00:08:19.160 --> 00:08:21.960]   Accessibility is a half baked cake.
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:26.080]   And Apple just does a particularly good job of it, especially on the iOS platform.
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:27.560]   Lesson on the Mac, but only I was.
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:28.560]   Well, and sometimes they take a step back.
[00:08:28.560 --> 00:08:33.560]   I remember I got on a lot of calls a few versions ago when they took some features away
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:34.560]   from Siri.
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:40.600]   Like Siri read my email that was a big, I think, mistake from an exuberant.
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:42.080]   Accessibility point of view.
[00:08:42.080 --> 00:08:44.520]   Yeah, that happens occasionally.
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:48.000]   More often the issue with accessibility is some sort of bug because there's so much going
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:54.280]   on in the iOS operating system that sometimes new features will cause a bug to exist in
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:58.160]   voiceover or to exist when you're reading Braille on a Braille display.
[00:08:58.160 --> 00:09:00.760]   And so those don't tend to be showstopper bugs.
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:04.280]   And so sometimes those bugs stay in a little longer than you would like.
[00:09:04.280 --> 00:09:10.480]   And so there's a pretty active group of people out there, both beta testers and just consumers
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.440]   of this stuff that will let Apple know what they think.
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:18.040]   And usually it gets resolved, but sometimes it takes a little while for that to happen.
[00:09:18.040 --> 00:09:23.000]   Last night I had a new bed partner, a rather large wristwatch.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.840]   I got the Apple Ultra wristwatch.
[00:09:27.840 --> 00:09:28.840]   It is.
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:29.840]   Does it look?
[00:09:29.840 --> 00:09:30.840]   Does it?
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:31.840]   Does this watch make my butt look big?
[00:09:31.840 --> 00:09:35.080]   Does it actually makes it look small, doesn't it?
[00:09:35.080 --> 00:09:37.840]   It's a pretty hefty thing, but it's.
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.280]   You could watch a TV show on that watch.
[00:09:40.280 --> 00:09:42.280]   And wait, that's why I kind of like it.
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:46.520]   Like maybe not the Lord of the Rings TV show, but I feel like one of those HBO prestige
[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.360]   dramas without the ragons, you could totally watch it on the watch.
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.880]   As long as there are no drags.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:51.880]   I mean, I consider it.
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:54.240]   I just like the idea that you can get large type on it.
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:55.240]   That makes me happy.
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.720]   There's some people who want to think of it as an accessibility watch.
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:00.680]   I'm like, yeah, but I have tiny little woman wrists and I don't think I swear.
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:04.960]   No, yeah, it might not be great to wear, but it is a lot better to use this face for all
[00:10:04.960 --> 00:10:06.760]   new women bracelets, actually.
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:08.480]   100% I like it.
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.520]   Well, this is actually the thing is you take a look.
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:14.280]   The watch is a form factor that goes back a couple hundred years, right?
[00:10:14.280 --> 00:10:18.560]   So why aren't we updating our technology form factors for wearables to reflect what
[00:10:18.560 --> 00:10:23.680]   our stuff actually is meant to do as opposed to trying to mash these previously unheard
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:30.240]   of tasks and processes into things that were invented to reflect a much earlier than before?
[00:10:30.240 --> 00:10:31.240]   I'll tell you why.
[00:10:31.240 --> 00:10:32.240]   I'll tell you why.
[00:10:32.240 --> 00:10:33.240]   Look, go ahead.
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:36.000]   Here's an example of a ladies fashion band.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   Oh, it's terrible.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   It doesn't look good.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   It doesn't look.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   It's too thin.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:42.840]   Now, give us the Wonder Woman wrist cuffs.
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:44.840]   Oh, there you go.
[00:10:44.840 --> 00:10:45.840]   Yeah, wrist cuffs.
[00:10:45.840 --> 00:10:47.240]   That have come into it.
[00:10:47.240 --> 00:10:49.480]   Like turn the watch into like a wrist cuffs.
[00:10:49.480 --> 00:10:50.480]   Here's some blameth.
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:51.480]   Here's some blameth.
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:55.920]   But to Lisa's point, Leo, if you think about the original Macintosh desktop, what they were
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:11:01.920]   doing is they were taking a computer and using a very old, you know, physical metaphor
[00:11:01.920 --> 00:11:06.080]   moving it over to the computer and actually not necessarily because it worked better,
[00:11:06.080 --> 00:11:08.560]   but if people were familiar with it.
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:09.560]   Yeah.
[00:11:09.560 --> 00:11:10.560]   That's called pumorphism, right?
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:11.560]   Wasn't it?
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:13.560]   And that's the thing we've kind of now started to eschew.
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:18.880]   Isn't it Xerox Park that really began to conceive of the desktop metaphor and start
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:20.480]   mainstreaming it back in the '70s?
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:25.360]   They had to do that because this was all, you know, I'm used to files and folders.
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.400]   But now I think this is a, there you go.
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:28.400]   This is a very...
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:31.440]   Well, ask anybody under the age of 20.
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:37.280]   Free leopard elastic cheetah printed beaded bracelet strap for the iWatch SE and series
[00:11:37.280 --> 00:11:38.280]   ultra.
[00:11:38.280 --> 00:11:39.280]   So how is this much?
[00:11:39.280 --> 00:11:40.280]   Thank you.
[00:11:40.280 --> 00:11:41.280]   You know, I don't know.
[00:11:41.280 --> 00:11:43.480]   Like make those beats do stuff like the technology in Wakanda.
[00:11:43.480 --> 00:11:45.280]   Oh, so you want bows.
[00:11:45.280 --> 00:11:47.200]   I'm glad to exist.
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.400]   I don't want to own it personally, but I wanted to exist.
[00:11:49.400 --> 00:11:52.120]   You want to be a woman warrior with a watch.
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:56.400]   I'm just saying I think a watch is like a horse buggy where it was a technology that
[00:11:56.400 --> 00:12:02.960]   worked really well for the demand it needed to meet and what we expect to do with the
[00:12:02.960 --> 00:12:06.280]   technology we wear has changed substantially.
[00:12:06.280 --> 00:12:10.040]   That's why this isn't a watch anymore than the iPhone is a phone.
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:11.040]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:12.840]   This is a technology device.
[00:12:12.840 --> 00:12:14.800]   And in fact, I can call people.
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:15.800]   I can send texts.
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:17.360]   This is actually a Dick Tracy watch.
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:21.600]   I can be on a hike and listening to music without my phone, listening to music, make
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:24.960]   a call, fall and put...
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:25.960]   You want to hear the alarm?
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:26.960]   Oh, yeah.
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:27.960]   Absolutely.
[00:12:27.960 --> 00:12:28.960]   Lay it.
[00:12:28.960 --> 00:12:31.960]   Cover your ears, everybody.
[00:12:31.960 --> 00:12:36.600]   If you're in your car, you're not getting pulled over by the cops just to let you know.
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.720]   If the cops car is sounding like this, I'd be scared.
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:41.720]   This is, I think Apple said, what, 88 dB.
[00:12:41.720 --> 00:12:48.400]   So it's not so much intended to be super loud as detectable.
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:53.360]   If you've fallen and searchers know you're roughly in this area, you would set this off.
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:56.720]   You were saying there was a guy who had a heat stroke who passed away because he was
[00:12:56.720 --> 00:12:57.720]   feet from the path.
[00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:02.240]   Yeah, it was a really sad case in Pleasanton last year where he was a distance runner.
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:03.240]   He went out.
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:04.240]   Stop.
[00:13:04.240 --> 00:13:05.240]   It was too hot.
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:06.240]   Thank you.
[00:13:06.240 --> 00:13:07.240]   It was too hot.
[00:13:07.240 --> 00:13:08.240]   He got heat stroke.
[00:13:08.240 --> 00:13:12.560]   He passed out and because it's really hard to find people when they fall into underbrush.
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.560]   Right.
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:14.560]   That's what this is for.
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:15.560]   Yeah.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:16.560]   It's basically to alert folks.
[00:13:16.560 --> 00:13:19.840]   And see, to me, the sound of that alarm, I can't tell because I'm not in the studio.
[00:13:19.840 --> 00:13:21.240]   I don't know how loud it is to you guys.
[00:13:21.240 --> 00:13:22.240]   It's not that loud.
[00:13:22.240 --> 00:13:24.880]   It's not like an alarm.
[00:13:24.880 --> 00:13:26.040]   It's not an ambulance alarm.
[00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:27.200]   It's not like the Europeans.
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:29.960]   It's not an alarm as one traditionally thinks of it.
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:34.000]   I'm not saying it's a pleasant sound, but it's an unusual enough sound and it's diffuse
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:35.400]   enough that it feels...
[00:13:35.400 --> 00:13:39.400]   I understand what they're saying when they talk about how far the sound projects, how
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:40.400]   far it carries.
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:43.200]   It doesn't hurt your ears.
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:47.920]   People will do tests on it, but I felt positively toward it when I heard it in the video.
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:50.920]   You could tell what it is.
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:52.920]   Somebody says I just scrambled a search and rescue team.
[00:13:52.920 --> 00:13:53.920]   I don't think so.
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:54.920]   I hope not.
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:55.920]   I'm fine.
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:56.920]   I'm fine.
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:00.920]   Unless you have a great amount of power and you've configured it to do that.
[00:14:00.920 --> 00:14:03.000]   Well, there are certain things that's hard to test.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:06.360]   So the crash detection, that would be hard to test.
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:08.000]   The new satellite feature.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:09.480]   Eightfold test anyway.
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:10.480]   So there's actually...
[00:14:10.480 --> 00:14:14.400]   This ties into my day job, believe it or not, because one of the big issues that's been
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:20.640]   emerging and percolating through communication is accurate 911 positioning and location.
[00:14:20.640 --> 00:14:24.080]   And we don't have a whole lot of time to get into laws that have just passed.
[00:14:24.080 --> 00:14:29.440]   But suffice it to say, there are now laws in place that require any address to be able
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:33.480]   to convey accurate geographic information to 911 dispatchers.
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:39.400]   And I was interviewing folks who run the emergency response services for a particular county
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:41.120]   in Tennessee.
[00:14:41.120 --> 00:14:46.400]   And this is a huge part of their job is trying to find people who are in peril and get accurate
[00:14:46.400 --> 00:14:51.000]   addresses so they can send out the right type of search and rescue operation.
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   Is it fire?
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   Is it an ambulance?
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   Is it police?
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   Whatever.
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:59.560]   And what I'm super curious about with this watch is in addition to the alarm, I want to
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:02.520]   find out how search and rescue operations feel.
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:07.040]   Like if they're saying yes, this is something that has a provable effect on our ability
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:12.000]   to find people, especially in the outdoors, because everything is united, where everything
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.920]   is the rise of people who have been needed, who need to be rescued in the outdoors is
[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:19.120]   actually shot up exponentially.
[00:15:19.120 --> 00:15:24.280]   In part, thanks to, you know, GPS devices, watches, everyone's like, Oh, I have, I have
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:25.280]   two bars.
[00:15:25.280 --> 00:15:26.280]   I can go anywhere.
[00:15:26.280 --> 00:15:29.280]   This watch makes you want to climb a mountain scuba dive.
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:31.480]   And you're like, I have GPS and I'm fine.
[00:15:31.480 --> 00:15:32.480]   You're not fine.
[00:15:32.480 --> 00:15:34.320]   You don't know how to climb a 14 year.
[00:15:34.320 --> 00:15:36.000]   So no, you're right.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.280]   I should not be out there.
[00:15:37.280 --> 00:15:42.000]   So I would love to find out from search and rescue folk if something like this feature,
[00:15:42.000 --> 00:15:48.560]   which Apple is selling as a way to push peace of mind, will genuinely be effective for search
[00:15:48.560 --> 00:15:52.680]   and rescue operations or if it's something where you have a sense of safety, but it's
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:57.160]   a false sense of safety because it doesn't get you the desired outcome.
[00:15:57.160 --> 00:16:00.920]   We don't have the data yet, but I think that's going to be something worth keeping in mind
[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:04.920]   and asking folks who do this for living, you know, have you seen a measurable impact on
[00:16:04.920 --> 00:16:05.920]   this?
[00:16:05.920 --> 00:16:09.240]   I mean, they've seen measurable impacts on we have had to take this person off a mountain
[00:16:09.240 --> 00:16:11.360]   because they got cold and called 911.
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:12.360]   Right.
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:15.760]   Well, and this has features that would tempt me.
[00:16:15.760 --> 00:16:16.760]   Yeah.
[00:16:16.760 --> 00:16:18.800]   For instance, it's got a breadcrumb feature.
[00:16:18.800 --> 00:16:24.200]   I can push a button and as I'm walking around and it will leave a GPS marker and then I
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:28.840]   could in theory and I know I would get lost immediately, follow the watch back home.
[00:16:28.840 --> 00:16:29.840]   Yeah.
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.800]   Then I might make me think, Oh, I could go off trail because I'm going to be able to figure
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.200]   out where I am.
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.200]   That's maybe not such a good idea.
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:40.200]   And that's actually theoretically an accessibility feature because there's term by turn GPS that
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:41.320]   we all use.
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:45.960]   But if you are in a parking lot and never mind being off trail and you're trying to
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:49.400]   get from one place that you're familiar with to a place that you're not and you somehow
[00:16:49.400 --> 00:16:53.560]   get lost along the way, you can theoretically retrace your steps.
[00:16:53.560 --> 00:16:56.640]   I don't know how it behaves in practice, but I can see that.
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:58.640]   I guess I'll have to lose my car and try it.
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:16:59.640]   They actually do.
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:02.440]   Airport parking lots would be amazing for them.
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:06.800]   There is a button that you can do a waypoint for your car, your parked car.
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:07.800]   That's great.
[00:17:07.800 --> 00:17:10.040]   So they clearly know that that's maybe one of the uses for it.
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:15.960]   I wonder how much they're influenced by accessibility that they're building something for the extreme
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:19.320]   athlete, but really maybe this is for everybody.
[00:17:19.320 --> 00:17:24.920]   There's a lot about accessibility that benefits people who aren't necessarily have moved
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:25.920]   that disability.
[00:17:25.920 --> 00:17:26.920]   That's right.
[00:17:26.920 --> 00:17:32.280]   Like like curbs that you know, ramps on curbs benefit people with strollers, people on bicycles,
[00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:33.280]   roller skates.
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:35.720]   You don't have to be in a wheelchair to benefit from that.
[00:17:35.720 --> 00:17:36.720]   Absolutely.
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:38.160]   I'm sure that's a really good installation.
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:41.280]   Those features too tend to trickle down in some way.
[00:17:41.280 --> 00:17:46.160]   So if you don't feel like buying a minimum $800 watch that is enormous, maybe in the
[00:17:46.160 --> 00:17:50.000]   next couple of years, some of those features like the breadcrumb feature particularly,
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.720]   or some of the other ones that are not really, you're probably not going to get a dive computer
[00:17:53.720 --> 00:17:59.160]   on your Apple Watch SE, but at some point your SE or your 9 or your 10 might have a
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:02.960]   breadcrumb feature if it proves to be popular and certainly from an accessibility point
[00:18:02.960 --> 00:18:04.960]   of view, that would be great to have on other phones.
[00:18:04.960 --> 00:18:07.160]   If someone will steal the idea, maybe it'll be on your Fitbit.
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:09.560]   That could have been a neat knockoff.
[00:18:09.560 --> 00:18:14.400]   When I'm setting it up, it asks you some questions about how you watch the watch setup.
[00:18:14.400 --> 00:18:18.280]   And one of the questions is, would you like to know how deep you are and how cold the
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:20.400]   water is when you're diving?
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:23.880]   And of course, I'm never going to use that, but I said yes.
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:24.880]   Oh my gosh, yes.
[00:18:24.880 --> 00:18:25.880]   Of course I was.
[00:18:25.880 --> 00:18:30.680]   Just in case you die, I did fall off a ship and I'd like to know well.
[00:18:30.680 --> 00:18:33.360]   As I'm going down, I'm getting deeper.
[00:18:33.360 --> 00:18:34.360]   Right.
[00:18:34.360 --> 00:18:35.360]   No, I do.
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:36.360]   We found Leo.
[00:18:36.360 --> 00:18:37.360]   Why would you turn that around?
[00:18:37.360 --> 00:18:38.360]   I think that's it.
[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:41.560]   So I have a girlfriend who's doing her project where she's hitting 50 different swimming holes
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:44.800]   around the state of California before she turns 50.
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:46.400]   And she's been blogging her progress.
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:50.240]   And one of the pieces of equipment she takes with her while she does this is a water thermometer
[00:18:50.240 --> 00:18:55.320]   because she has limits on how cold the water is going to be.
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:58.560]   And I wonder how this watch might fit into that kind of project.
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:01.920]   If you can have, there's a complication on this particular face.
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:02.920]   This is water temperature.
[00:19:02.920 --> 00:19:03.920]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:06.560]   So I could actually be monitoring that even when I'm.
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:10.760]   So I want to shout out a comment that CR one just made in the US, the Apple Watch should
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:12.760]   include your health insurance status.
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:16.360]   If you don't have insurance, the Apple Watch should ignore you.
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.200]   Oh, that's a very good point.
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:21.320]   Well, what I'm wondering is why aren't insurance companies working harder to put together
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:23.320]   integrations that work on the Apple Watch?
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:24.320]   Certainly.
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:25.320]   Why don't you do that?
[00:19:25.320 --> 00:19:26.320]   It's permanent.
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:27.320]   Why don't you watch?
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:28.320]   Or stick?
[00:19:28.320 --> 00:19:29.320]   Certainly.
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:32.320]   There are a lot of hospitals doing research studies with the watch.
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:33.320]   Yeah.
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:34.320]   Yeah.
[00:19:34.320 --> 00:19:37.320]   So, I mean, there are employers that are giving people incentives for having the watch, which
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:43.240]   has some implications for their medical insurance and either incentives or their outright giving
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:46.320]   employees, Apple watches in exchange for some sort of healthy behaviors.
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:49.360]   And actually, I know a couple people who have had those experiences.
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:52.640]   And I kind of wonder how positive it is because there's all that data.
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:57.260]   So you as the employee get the benefit of having the watch, but are you also sharing
[00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:00.320]   more data than you intend either with your company or with your insurer?
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:04.040]   That was a plot point in Billions and Showtime's Show Billions.
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:05.040]   That's it.
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:10.160]   At one point, the new owner comes in and gives an Apple Watch to all the employees.
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:11.880]   Like, you're so great.
[00:20:11.880 --> 00:20:12.880]   Stick around.
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:13.880]   Here's your Apple Watch.
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:18.240]   Then it turns out he's got a dashboard and they're watching all the employees.
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:23.360]   And at one point, the two of them are watching one employee having a heart attack.
[00:20:23.360 --> 00:20:26.400]   And now they're going, "God, what do we do?
[00:20:26.400 --> 00:20:27.400]   Should we..."
[00:20:27.400 --> 00:20:28.400]   Why wouldn't you call?
[00:20:28.400 --> 00:20:32.040]   Because we didn't tell them we were going to be monitoring them.
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:34.920]   So they did end up calling emergency services.
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:37.520]   The EMT shows up at WAGS.
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:38.520]   He's on a Peloton.
[00:20:38.520 --> 00:20:40.080]   Nice plug for Peloton.
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:41.840]   He's on a Peloton pedaling in the EMT shop.
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:43.560]   He says, "What are you doing here?
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:44.560]   I'm fine."
[00:20:44.560 --> 00:20:47.240]   And he's on the tag.
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:49.680]   It's kind of a stupid plot point.
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:53.840]   But it is that plot point, which is, you know, employers can monitor you.
[00:20:53.840 --> 00:20:57.480]   Well, the other question is, "How much of a reasonable right to privacy do you have?"
[00:20:57.480 --> 00:21:00.720]   If you're consenting to put an employer provided, a dangerous generator.
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:09.800]   I can't imagine an MDM that lets you monitor your employee's heart rate.
[00:21:09.800 --> 00:21:11.360]   Well, it's not just that.
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:12.360]   How many steps?
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.840]   Or, for example, you block out on Outlook.
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:18.600]   I'm in focus mode for four hours because Outlook now lets you do that with Microsoft
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:19.600]   Eva.
[00:21:19.600 --> 00:21:20.600]   And you're at focus mode.
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:25.240]   But your focus mode is you like running 15K because you're training for a marathon.
[00:21:25.240 --> 00:21:29.120]   Can they now check and go, "Oh, somebody said they were in focus mode at work, but they've
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:31.120]   just done 25,000 steps."
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:32.120]   You know?
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:38.560]   By the way, WAGS, in this show says, "Who called the EMT?"
[00:21:38.560 --> 00:21:41.280]   And finally figures out, "Oh my God, is this what?"
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:44.680]   You immediately throws it out.
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:45.680]   Yeah.
[00:21:45.680 --> 00:21:46.680]   Even though it might have saved his life.
[00:21:46.680 --> 00:21:47.680]   It saved his life?
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:48.680]   Yeah.
[00:21:48.680 --> 00:21:50.240]   But your privacy is more important than your life, of course.
[00:21:50.240 --> 00:21:51.240]   Well, is it?
[00:21:51.240 --> 00:21:52.240]   That's certainly how we act.
[00:21:52.240 --> 00:21:53.240]   No, I think there are people who are...
[00:21:53.240 --> 00:21:54.240]   No, I think there are people who are...
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.240]   No, I think there are people who are...
[00:21:55.240 --> 00:21:56.240]   No, I think there are people who are...
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:57.240]   No, I think there are people who are...
[00:21:57.240 --> 00:21:58.240]   No, I think there are people who are...
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.240]   No, I think there are people who are...
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:00.240]   No, I think there are people who are...
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:01.240]   No, I think there are people who are...
[00:22:01.240 --> 00:22:02.240]   No, I think there are people who are...
[00:22:02.240 --> 00:22:03.240]   No, I think there are people who are...
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:04.240]   No, I think there are people who are...
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:05.240]   No, I think there are people who are...
[00:22:05.240 --> 00:22:26.240]   No, I think there are people who are...
[00:22:26.240 --> 00:22:27.240]   No, I think there are people who are...
[00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:28.240]   No, I think there are people who are...
[00:22:28.240 --> 00:22:29.240]   No, I think there are people who are...
[00:22:29.240 --> 00:22:30.240]   No, I think there are people who are...
[00:22:30.240 --> 00:22:31.240]   No, I think there are people who are...
[00:22:31.240 --> 00:22:32.240]   No, I think there are people who are...
[00:22:32.240 --> 00:22:33.240]   No, I think there are people who are...
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:35.240]   No, I think there are people who are...
[00:22:35.240 --> 00:22:36.240]   No, I think there are people who are...
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.240]   No, I think there are people who are...
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:38.240]   No, I think there are people who are...
[00:22:38.240 --> 00:22:39.240]   No, I think there are people who are...
[00:22:39.240 --> 00:22:40.240]   No, I think there are people who are...
[00:22:40.240 --> 00:22:41.240]   No, I think there are people who are...
[00:22:41.240 --> 00:22:42.240]   No, I think there are people who are...

[00:42:08.240 --> 00:42:10.240]   No, you're gonna get more of it.
[00:42:10.240 --> 00:42:11.240]   Yeah, you do.
[00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:12.240]   You do.
[00:42:12.240 --> 00:42:13.240]   You do. Does it because it works?
[00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:14.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:42:14.240 --> 00:42:16.240]   I mean, they're not doing stuff because it doesn't work.
[00:42:16.240 --> 00:42:20.240]   What's really changed in this era is this tight feedback loop
[00:42:20.240 --> 00:42:24.240]   that all of these programs have because they see everything you're doing
[00:42:24.240 --> 00:42:26.240]   so they can really respond.
[00:42:26.240 --> 00:42:30.240]   So, I mean, I think you have to stipulate they're doing it because it works.
[00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:32.240]   Well, you know, it's interesting. I don't want to...
[00:42:32.240 --> 00:42:36.240]   I'm not worried about being turned into a Nazi, but I do sometimes worry about...
[00:42:36.240 --> 00:42:40.240]   I do look at right-wing extremist websites because I want to see what they're publishing.
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:43.240]   But then I worry, am I adding to their popularity?
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:44.240]   I won't do it.
[00:42:44.240 --> 00:42:45.240]   I somehow helping them.
[00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:46.240]   I won't go to the store, too.
[00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:47.240]   Even though I'm not giving them any money.
[00:42:47.240 --> 00:42:48.240]   I won't do it.
[00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:50.240]   Yeah, I won't go to the Daily Stormer.
[00:42:50.240 --> 00:42:54.240]   That just seems like a bad idea, but you need to do it for your job.
[00:42:54.240 --> 00:43:00.240]   Well, I feel like I should at least look at Breitbart now and then and some of these.
[00:43:00.240 --> 00:43:02.240]   I won't even mention the names of them.
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:05.240]   I don't want you to promote them, but yeah, I do feel like I need to look at them,
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:06.240]   and it's true.
[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:09.240]   I do worry about what benefit are they getting from?
[00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:13.240]   I've written a separate Google account for that reason.
[00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:17.240]   I sometimes accidentally be in my own account and I'll be like,
[00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:19.240]   "Oh my God, I went to the wrong place."
[00:43:19.240 --> 00:43:21.240]   You can send me to Gmail.com. That's you, huh?
[00:43:21.240 --> 00:43:23.240]   Yeah, I can't even go back to the old.
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:25.240]   Don't tell everyone to do that.
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:29.240]   I go back to the problem that engagement is completely divorced from context.
[00:43:29.240 --> 00:43:34.240]   And if these companies are tweaking their algorithms and the user experience based on the premise
[00:43:34.240 --> 00:43:37.240]   that engagement is the only good or the only end,
[00:43:37.240 --> 00:43:42.240]   it's really bad both as a user experience thing and as a product thing.
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:43.240]   It's several different assets.
[00:43:43.240 --> 00:43:47.240]   It's also engagement all the way down because it's not only YouTube doing that.
[00:43:47.240 --> 00:43:50.240]   The sites are creating lick-baity headlines.
[00:43:50.240 --> 00:43:54.240]   I mean, everybody is trying to grab your attention.
[00:43:54.240 --> 00:43:55.240]   Everybody is.
[00:43:55.240 --> 00:43:59.240]   Sometimes I will actually, when I go into Google, I'll turn on my VPN.
[00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:02.240]   I'll go into incognito mode or in private mode and I'll do a search
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:06.240]   and then I'll do the same search with me logged in without the VPN.
[00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:08.240]   And it's amazing the differences.
[00:44:08.240 --> 00:44:12.240]   One of the disappointing differences is that I don't come up as often
[00:44:12.240 --> 00:44:15.240]   when I do a search if I'm on a VPN.
[00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:18.240]   Can I just tell you ego searches when you're not logged in or not?
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:22.240]   I know, I thought, apparently, Google will say, "Ooh, Larry, we're going to make you feel good about your stuff."
[00:44:22.240 --> 00:44:25.240]   Yeah, Doc.gov doesn't like me as much as Google does. It's weird.
[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:30.240]   So when I first think to do on Google, take a look at what they think they know about me based on
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:33.240]   the ads where you can go through and they're like, "Oh, tweak your data."
[00:44:33.240 --> 00:44:35.240]   So it's more this and more that.
[00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:40.240]   And oddly enough, I've never been a 28-year-old male military veteran.
[00:44:40.240 --> 00:44:41.240]   That you know of.
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:42.240]   Right?
[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:43.240]   It's okay.
[00:44:43.240 --> 00:44:45.240]   I've never watched the Kardashians.
[00:44:45.240 --> 00:44:47.240]   I still get recommendations for them.
[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:52.240]   So this goes back to, if engagement is the greater good, how flawed is the data that they're collecting?
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:57.240]   And selling, it sort of reminds me a lot of when Facebook was aggressively pushing videos
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:45:01.240]   and it turned out their sales department was completely juking the stats as they'd say on also
[00:45:01.240 --> 00:45:03.240]   "exploit HBO Show the Wire."
[00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:10.240]   They're juking the stats and you did not know truthfully and honestly how people were
[00:45:10.240 --> 00:45:15.240]   engaging with video on Facebook, but they were making all this money by saying, "Oh, we think it's like this."
[00:45:15.240 --> 00:45:20.240]   And I have to wonder, is this the same on YouTube? Is this the same on Google?
[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:26.240]   At what point do you look at the data and say this data is useless because it doesn't accurately
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:32.240]   measure what people are watching. It just accurately measures engagement, which is different than
[00:45:32.240 --> 00:45:34.240]   sitting down and watching a video from beginning to end.
[00:45:34.240 --> 00:45:35.240]   One of the lessons.
[00:45:35.240 --> 00:45:39.240]   Your observation about collecting air conditioners is a good point because every time I buy something
[00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:43.240]   for the next six months I'm inundated and the last thing I'm going to do is buy that again.
[00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:44.240]   I just bought it.
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:45.240]   Thank you very much.
[00:45:45.240 --> 00:45:46.240]   I don't need another air conditioner.
[00:45:46.240 --> 00:45:52.240]   One of the lessons, in fact I just read an article about this referencing the Wire,
[00:45:52.240 --> 00:45:59.240]   is when you decide what the stats you're going to monitor are, you are tilting the whole thing
[00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:01.240]   towards those stats.
[00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:06.240]   And that was the point of the Wire, is you juke the stats and majors become kernels because
[00:46:06.240 --> 00:46:10.240]   they go, "Oh, all I have to do is bring down..."
[00:46:10.240 --> 00:46:15.240]   In fact there's a famous scene in the Wire where he tells McNulty, "Don't bring me any murders.
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:18.240]   We're trying to get our stats up."
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:20.240]   So I don't want to know about any murders.
[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:22.240]   We want our solve rate to be higher.
[00:46:22.240 --> 00:46:26.240]   That's exactly the wrong result because you're juke in the stats.
[00:46:26.240 --> 00:46:31.240]   Well there was a great Wall Street Journal piece this last week talking about salary
[00:46:31.240 --> 00:46:37.240]   transparency and it's based on a study that researchers did of the National Hockey League
[00:46:37.240 --> 00:46:42.240]   when the salaries of every single player were published in Montreal Gazette back in the,
[00:46:42.240 --> 00:46:46.240]   I believe it's the 70's that happened, and a bunch of economists took a look at what
[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:51.240]   happened afterwards and what they noted is that the folks who were on the lower end of the
[00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:54.240]   salary scale took a look at the folks on the higher end of the salary scale and noticed,
[00:46:54.240 --> 00:47:00.240]   "Hey, they're not great team players, but they're great at racking up individual stats."
[00:47:00.240 --> 00:47:05.240]   So I'm not going to focus on defense, I'm not going to focus on passing, I'm not going
[00:47:05.240 --> 00:47:09.240]   to focus on team first, I'm going to focus on racking up my stats so that I have more
[00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:11.240]   value to the people paying money.
[00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:17.240]   Consequently, the quality of play changed, but the people who played juke the stats got
[00:47:17.240 --> 00:47:22.240]   the money and the point of the economists was, "Well, you can have pay transparency or
[00:47:22.240 --> 00:47:26.240]   you can simply pay people what they're worth and you have to decide worth based on, is
[00:47:26.240 --> 00:47:27.240]   it worth having teamwork?"
[00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:31.240]   But this is the same thing where once you figure out what the metrics are, everyone
[00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:32.240]   performs to the metrics.
[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:33.240]   So what's the solution?
[00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:38.240]   I mean I've said a lot and I think it's probably the wrong solution but I've always,
[00:47:38.240 --> 00:47:42.240]   I've said a lot anyway, is get rid of algorithms.
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:44.240]   Algorithms are the problem, right?
[00:47:44.240 --> 00:47:45.240]   They are in some places.
[00:47:45.240 --> 00:47:50.240]   I mean I don't need an algorithm on Facebook, I want to just follow the people I follow.
[00:47:50.240 --> 00:47:51.240]   On Twitter I want to follow the people I follow.
[00:47:51.240 --> 00:47:56.240]   I don't need you to recommend stuff based on what you think I'm interested in.
[00:47:56.240 --> 00:47:57.240]   I guess.
[00:47:57.240 --> 00:47:58.240]   Who do algorithms serve?
[00:47:58.240 --> 00:47:59.240]   Yeah, who do algorithms serve?
[00:47:59.240 --> 00:48:00.240]   I do too.
[00:48:00.240 --> 00:48:03.240]   But I think it does kind of depend on the platform because I think Facebook and Twitter, those
[00:48:03.240 --> 00:48:07.240]   are perfect examples of, "I have chosen to follow people, that's who I want to follow."
[00:48:07.240 --> 00:48:13.760]   But YouTube and TikTok are examples of platforms where there's some joy in going down a rabbit
[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:16.240]   hole and being shown things that you don't expect.
[00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:19.240]   Partly because we're used to it, we've been trained to enjoy it.
[00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:24.240]   Well also when you have a billion videos, discoverability is a problem.
[00:48:24.240 --> 00:48:25.240]   They're trying to solve that.
[00:48:25.240 --> 00:48:26.240]   100%.
[00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:27.240]   I feel that way about television.
[00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:30.240]   And if you have a lot of people, you follow a lot of people.
[00:48:30.240 --> 00:48:34.240]   So I had this situation on Facebook where I was getting bored by the fact that I kept seeing
[00:48:34.240 --> 00:48:37.240]   the same posts over and over again from a limited number of people.
[00:48:37.240 --> 00:48:41.240]   And I said, "Okay, I'm going to turn off that algorithm and make sure I see everything
[00:48:41.240 --> 00:48:44.440]   in chronological reverse chronicle and order."
[00:48:44.440 --> 00:48:48.240]   Then I got even more bored because I started hearing people who I could care less about.
[00:48:48.240 --> 00:48:49.240]   That's what they're saying.
[00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:51.240]   That's why they juke the stats.
[00:48:51.240 --> 00:48:52.240]   Right.
[00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:55.440]   So I went back to turning, I turned the algorithm back on.
[00:48:55.440 --> 00:49:02.040]   My point was that I hear what you say on the negative, but at the same time, it actually,
[00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:05.040]   does create, in my opinion, a slightly better experience.
[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:08.040]   Although that's why I torpedoed my own argument the moment.
[00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:10.040]   Yeah, I mean, I really did a lot of arguments.
[00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:11.040]   But what is the answer?
[00:49:11.040 --> 00:49:16.040]   Well, algorithms are a mechanized substitution for the curatorial experience.
[00:49:16.040 --> 00:49:20.040]   Because when you think about the 20th century, you had a whole lot of...
[00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:21.040]   The curation doesn't scale.
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:22.040]   Well, yeah, exactly.
[00:49:22.040 --> 00:49:23.040]   And that's the challenge.
[00:49:23.040 --> 00:49:27.440]   That's what algorithms are supposed to be doing is one of my favorite side topics is like
[00:49:27.440 --> 00:49:30.160]   the rise and fall of the Conde Nast Publishing Empire.
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:32.440]   And I will read any memoir I get my hands on about it.
[00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:36.120]   And most of the time, it was like people got obscene amounts of money for being able
[00:49:36.120 --> 00:49:42.160]   to correctly put their thumb on the zeitgeist and then commodify those insights, right?
[00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:44.800]   And a wind tour at Fog.
[00:49:44.800 --> 00:49:47.160]   And a wind tour, Grayden Carter, Tina Brown.
[00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:48.160]   Tina Brown.
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:49.160]   Class.
[00:49:49.160 --> 00:49:50.240]   David Remick.
[00:49:50.240 --> 00:49:53.360]   For a while, oh, Ruth Reichl over at Gourmet.
[00:49:53.360 --> 00:49:54.360]   Yeah.
[00:49:54.360 --> 00:49:55.520]   Kim France with Lucky Magazine.
[00:49:55.520 --> 00:50:00.800]   But again, that doesn't scale and you can't make great whoopsie loads of cash from it.
[00:50:00.800 --> 00:50:05.040]   Algorithms are supposed to be doing that kind of curatorial work that give you a surprising
[00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:07.240]   combination of things that's surprising to let you.
[00:50:07.240 --> 00:50:09.600]   So is an algorithm better than Tina Brown?
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:11.360]   No, but that's the thing is...
[00:50:11.360 --> 00:50:12.360]   No, that's the problem.
[00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:15.680]   Because when a human, you're paying for discernment.
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:17.080]   They're curating things.
[00:50:17.080 --> 00:50:21.680]   But that's based on that person's own experience and based on that person's knowledge of the
[00:50:21.680 --> 00:50:26.240]   area, whether it's gourmet food or whether it's culture or fashion or whatever it is, an
[00:50:26.240 --> 00:50:27.760]   algorithm is not going to do that.
[00:50:27.760 --> 00:50:32.960]   Algorithms is going to present me literal clips from the sopranos and Joe Bob's podcast
[00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:37.480]   and the podcast of the woman who said, "Christa Fah, all at once, and I'm not going to be able
[00:50:37.480 --> 00:50:39.600]   to make a choice unless I watch them all."
[00:50:39.600 --> 00:50:42.440]   And then the algorithm is going to say, "Oh, give her more of all of it."
[00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:46.240]   Yeah, because taste and discernment don't scale, but they're also tremendously liquid.
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:48.360]   They're what keeps Larry from getting bored with his feet.
[00:50:48.360 --> 00:50:50.760]   That's a condaing that snows because they don't know what they're going to do when Anna
[00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:51.760]   would tour retires.
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:52.760]   Yeah.
[00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:53.760]   Right?
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:54.760]   Yeah.
[00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:57.560]   That's that Vogue rises and falls on her shoulders.
[00:50:57.560 --> 00:51:02.920]   And without her, that fashion is a very good example of that because it's so tastemaker-driven.
[00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:06.640]   Well, it's another industry that's in tremendous disruption right now, too.
[00:51:06.640 --> 00:51:09.000]   I feel like we're going to have an open revolt in the chatroom where they're like, "We came
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:10.240]   here to talk about technology."
[00:51:10.240 --> 00:51:11.720]   But we are talking about technology.
[00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:12.720]   It is technology.
[00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:13.720]   This is exactly...
[00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:15.880]   How technology works, how it behaves for human beings.
[00:51:15.880 --> 00:51:16.880]   Yeah.
[00:51:16.880 --> 00:51:19.000]   Impact on every single industry in the world, including really passionate.
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:22.320]   But it's actually been a huge problem in retail over the past few last few years because you
[00:51:22.320 --> 00:51:26.520]   haven't been able to move the needle or have a big breakout in trend shifting since every
[00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:28.600]   trend happens everywhere all at once now.
[00:51:28.600 --> 00:51:33.440]   Thanks to the micro communities that aggregate around different algorithms driven through
[00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:34.440]   social media.
[00:51:34.440 --> 00:51:35.440]   Right.
[00:51:35.440 --> 00:51:37.240]   And by the way, I've always thought the chat was revolting.
[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:38.240]   So...
[00:51:38.240 --> 00:51:39.240]   Aww.
[00:51:39.240 --> 00:51:40.240]   Oh, I find you delight.
[00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:41.240]   I chat.
[00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:42.240]   No, I'm just teasing.
[00:51:42.240 --> 00:51:43.240]   No, I'm just teasing.
[00:51:43.240 --> 00:51:44.240]   I'm going to trouble the war.
[00:51:44.240 --> 00:51:45.240]   I am in big trouble.
[00:51:45.240 --> 00:51:55.240]   Adobe, $20 billion to save its business, I think, right?
[00:51:55.240 --> 00:52:02.840]   By buying Figma, a company that's annual recurring revenue is a mere $400 million.
[00:52:02.840 --> 00:52:07.040]   Here's an opinion piece in the Observer from this week by John Naughan.
[00:52:07.040 --> 00:52:16.080]   Adobe can't Photoshop out the fact that its $20 billion Figma deal is a naked land grab.
[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:19.920]   The software giant paying vastly over the odds for a small but strategically threatening
[00:52:19.920 --> 00:52:22.920]   company should alarm US regulators.
[00:52:22.920 --> 00:52:30.800]   Of course, this acquisition looks a lot like Facebook buying Instagram or WhatsApp, right?
[00:52:30.800 --> 00:52:36.360]   The idea being they're eating our lunch, it doesn't make any sense to pay $20 billion
[00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:37.360]   for a company that's never...
[00:52:37.360 --> 00:52:41.280]   It's going to take more than 20 years to pay back that investment.
[00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:43.800]   But otherwise, we're dead.
[00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:50.280]   Should the FTC allow this acquisition to go through or is it a chance for them to make
[00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:53.280]   up for their mistake with Instagram?
[00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:54.280]   Lisa?
[00:52:54.280 --> 00:52:57.360]   That's a good question.
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:53:01.880]   Since Figma solves a problem for a lot of Adobe users, which is there are too many things
[00:53:01.880 --> 00:53:03.480]   that I don't need?
[00:53:03.480 --> 00:53:07.680]   Yeah, people who love Figma are very unhappy about the acquisition.
[00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:13.120]   If you've ever used InDesign, it can be tremendously powerful if you've dedicated your life to InDesign.
[00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:14.120]   Yes.
[00:53:14.120 --> 00:53:17.280]   If it's lock in though for an InDesign expert.
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:22.720]   If you've taken the vows and joined the order and emerged yourself, it's great.
[00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:27.160]   But it's actually a problem similar to Microsoft's problem with there are so many functions that
[00:53:27.160 --> 00:53:29.600]   you're like, "I just want to do this simple workflow.
[00:53:29.600 --> 00:53:30.600]   Please let me do that."
[00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:35.680]   Figma solved this problem and Figma's locked down the user experience.
[00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:36.680]   People love it.
[00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:37.680]   Well, it sounds to me very similar to...
[00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:39.400]   It's also timely because of COVID.
[00:53:39.400 --> 00:53:41.480]   It's a collaborative design environment.
[00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:42.480]   Yeah.
[00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:44.240]   And it sounds to me really similar.
[00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:49.520]   Microsoft made a failed bid for Slack because they correctly guessed that, "Hey, this collaborative
[00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:54.160]   frictionless environment that people can transpose their workflow into is something we don't
[00:53:54.160 --> 00:53:57.000]   have and something we need a mind share on."
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:54:00.040]   It's the same thing.
[00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:05.600]   I feel terrible for the people who like Figma and are right to worry about what this will
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:07.640]   do for them.
[00:54:07.640 --> 00:54:10.640]   Should the government block it?
[00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:16.600]   Can the government make a plausible case that what this is doing is this Adobe Snuffing
[00:54:16.600 --> 00:54:17.600]   out competition?
[00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:19.960]   There's Sketch, there's Canva, there are other companies doing this.
[00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:23.640]   I mean, and the thing is, there's another story you had for this week too where Slack
[00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:26.200]   is now introduced Canvas which is a collaborative documenting date.
[00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:28.280]   Well, it does tie into that because everybody...
[00:54:28.280 --> 00:54:34.960]   Because it's going down to collaborative processes that are like a land grab right now anyway.
[00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:36.960]   Everybody and their brothers adding documents...
[00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:37.960]   Yeah.
[00:54:37.960 --> 00:54:41.320]   Well, they're adding collaborative workflow because they all saw people using not Gmail,
[00:54:41.320 --> 00:54:44.040]   Google Docs and be like, "Oh, I need to get done on that action."
[00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:47.880]   Even Apple's announced a new whiteboard app which I think is their stealth entry into
[00:54:47.880 --> 00:54:49.840]   this collaborative space.
[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:50.840]   Yeah.
[00:54:50.840 --> 00:54:51.840]   No.
[00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:54.240]   And you also know everybody, to get back to everything we talked about, you also know
[00:54:54.240 --> 00:55:00.040]   that having a collaborative workspace gives people tons of raw data on how ideas get
[00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:02.040]   generated, iterated, manipulated.
[00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:05.240]   Oh, they're not watching what we're doing, are they?
[00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:09.440]   Oh, but it also locks people in as customers.
[00:55:09.440 --> 00:55:11.680]   So if I've committed as a company to...
[00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:15.320]   I mean, we have at work, we have the Adobe Suite mostly because we use Audition to make
[00:55:15.320 --> 00:55:17.480]   radio and so we have Photoshop and use it.
[00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:18.880]   I can use InDesign.
[00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:19.880]   I don't.
[00:55:19.880 --> 00:55:21.680]   I make radio all day.
[00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:24.040]   And with Slack, if we've committed, we use Slack.
[00:55:24.040 --> 00:55:29.560]   If we commit to that document, the Canvas document thing, we're probably going to be
[00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:34.760]   more likely to continue a paid Slack subscription because the opportunity cost of going to
[00:55:34.760 --> 00:55:36.960]   something else would be high for us.
[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:39.120]   And so it makes sense for the companies to do that.
[00:55:39.120 --> 00:55:42.640]   I don't believe it's always in the best interest, whether it's Figma or whether it's somebody
[00:55:42.640 --> 00:55:48.480]   who's using some other collaborative document methodology to be locked into these platforms.
[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:49.680]   That's the way platforms are now.
[00:55:49.680 --> 00:55:51.440]   You don't buy software and boxes anymore.
[00:55:51.440 --> 00:55:52.440]   You buy the platform.
[00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:53.440]   See the license.
[00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:55.080]   But actually, Audition is a good example.
[00:55:55.080 --> 00:55:58.160]   I used to love Audition when it was $59.
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:00.080]   It's Adobe's audio editing program.
[00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:01.080]   Actually, they acquired it.
[00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:02.080]   It was cool.
[00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:03.080]   It was really...
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:05.360]   It used to be a great little product.
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:06.360]   Everybody radio used it.
[00:56:06.360 --> 00:56:07.360]   Yeah.
[00:56:07.360 --> 00:56:08.360]   I know.
[00:56:08.360 --> 00:56:12.800]   And I moved over to Audacity because Audition is just too complicated and too expensive
[00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:13.800]   and overkill from what I mean.
[00:56:13.800 --> 00:56:14.800]   That's the Adobe story.
[00:56:14.800 --> 00:56:15.800]   It's too complicated.
[00:56:15.800 --> 00:56:16.800]   Exactly.
[00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:18.040]   So they made it very Adobe.
[00:56:18.040 --> 00:56:23.200]   And truthfully, when we do multi-track and we put together complicated stories that are
[00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:27.400]   going to be multi-voice and with sound and with music, I use Audition because I like
[00:56:27.400 --> 00:56:28.680]   the multi-track tools.
[00:56:28.680 --> 00:56:32.520]   But if I'm just editing an interview that's a guest and a host, I get into there's a
[00:56:32.520 --> 00:56:34.720]   tool on the Mac called Amadeus Pro that I really like.
[00:56:34.720 --> 00:56:35.720]   Audacity works for that.
[00:56:35.720 --> 00:56:37.560]   I'm not a personally a fan of Audacity.
[00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:39.480]   But Audacity has this wonderful advantage.
[00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:40.480]   It's free.
[00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:41.480]   Right.
[00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:42.480]   I mean, I don't know the legal arguments.
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:43.480]   And it's multi-platform.
[00:56:43.480 --> 00:56:44.480]   That's what I'd be most interested in thinking.
[00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:46.280]   It also crashes half the time.
[00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:47.280]   Yeah.
[00:56:47.280 --> 00:56:50.440]   And I'm just an editor that's going to crash.
[00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:54.920]   I mean, because if it crashes and I've lost all the work I just did, I'm going to be
[00:56:54.920 --> 00:56:55.920]   very unhappy.
[00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:59.200]   I mean, maybe it's more reliable than it used to be.
[00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:00.440]   I use Twisted Wave.
[00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:03.640]   I'm actually hopeful for these guys because they've just started a Windows beta.
[00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:08.840]   Lisa's starting her own podcast and it's called Host Red Ads.
[00:57:08.840 --> 00:57:10.000]   I love it.
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:14.640]   And I'm teaching her to use Twisted Wave so she was recording it in Apple voice memos.
[00:57:14.640 --> 00:57:20.320]   And then posting it on the Anchor FM and it was left channel only.
[00:57:20.320 --> 00:57:23.920]   And nobody could figure out, well, I don't understand why it's only coming in one ear.
[00:57:23.920 --> 00:57:28.000]   And I explained the whole thing and I showed her how it twisted wave to make it a mono
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.000]   file before you uploaded and all that stuff.
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:32.560]   Oh, can I get some technical advice, Leo?
[00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:34.760]   Should my podcast be mono or stereo?
[00:57:34.760 --> 00:57:35.760]   Because they're just voice.
[00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:36.760]   Yeah.
[00:57:36.760 --> 00:57:37.760]   That's why I make our mono.
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:38.760]   If there's any reason to go to stereo.
[00:57:38.760 --> 00:57:40.760]   Your files are small too.
[00:57:40.760 --> 00:57:41.760]   Make them know.
[00:57:41.760 --> 00:57:42.760]   Yeah.
[00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:43.760]   So you cut the file size in half.
[00:57:43.760 --> 00:57:49.480]   64 kilobit mono is the same quality as 128 kilobit stereo.
[00:57:49.480 --> 00:57:55.000]   So that's one I think, Shelley, you can weigh in on this, but we're all radio people except
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:56.000]   for you, Lisa.
[00:57:56.000 --> 00:57:57.720]   If you've done radio, I wish I could.
[00:57:57.720 --> 00:57:58.720]   You should give a beautiful voice.
[00:57:58.720 --> 00:57:59.720]   I would love to.
[00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:00.720]   You could.
[00:58:00.720 --> 00:58:01.720]   Have me on Larry.
[00:58:01.720 --> 00:58:05.480]   I think mono punches through better.
[00:58:05.480 --> 00:58:10.640]   So remember the Beatles when they first recorded it was all mono and then they made terrible
[00:58:10.640 --> 00:58:15.360]   stereo mixes and they were awful and the Beatles never liked that.
[00:58:15.360 --> 00:58:20.080]   And in fact, Beatles collectors now prize those original mono versions of many of the
[00:58:20.080 --> 00:58:26.920]   first Beatles albums because that's how they were mixed and they punch through.
[00:58:26.920 --> 00:58:31.720]   So I think one of the things, this is completely far a field I apologize, but I think one of
[00:58:31.720 --> 00:58:36.240]   the things really important for voice only communications is that you're going to be
[00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:41.040]   listening in all sorts of adverse environments, the car while you're washing the dishes, walking
[00:58:41.040 --> 00:58:43.400]   down the street with sirens going by.
[00:58:43.400 --> 00:58:49.280]   And so it's really important that the voice punches through and when I used to do AM radio,
[00:58:49.280 --> 00:58:50.920]   we'd compress the hell out of it.
[00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:53.000]   That's the boss radio sound, right?
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:59.480]   But that's the reason so that it's not actually louder, but it feels more present.
[00:58:59.480 --> 00:59:01.240]   And I think mono gives you some of that.
[00:59:01.240 --> 00:59:03.960]   I also think you should compress it to be honest with you.
[00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:04.960]   Yeah.
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:06.240]   And I think it's a very good argument on both sides.
[00:59:06.240 --> 00:59:11.000]   The thing about mono is especially if you're doing a podcast, podcasters have a wide variety
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:13.280]   of audio quality in their podcasts.
[00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:18.520]   And if you do stereo, there's more of an opportunity for that badness to appear and what Leo says
[00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:21.200]   about it punching through and mono makes sense.
[00:59:21.200 --> 00:59:24.960]   I will do stereo separations if I have like four or five guests on my show.
[00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:25.960]   That makes sense, sure.
[00:59:25.960 --> 00:59:26.960]   And it does.
[00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:29.960]   And I'll tell you, that's another thing that I found out when I started hanging out with
[00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:36.040]   blind podcasters, that a lot of blind folks like to hear a stereo mix of multiple voices
[00:59:36.040 --> 00:59:40.920]   because it gives this sort of realistic sound of, you know, I'm over here on the left and
[00:59:40.920 --> 00:59:45.000]   Larry's on the right and Leo's a little bit left center and Lisa's right center.
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:47.480]   And it can be kind of a cool effect.
[00:59:47.480 --> 00:59:48.480]   You can go too far.
[00:59:48.480 --> 00:59:51.640]   Like there used to be a sort of a category of podcasting where people would call them
[00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:55.960]   soundseeing tours and people would go around and do their environments, you know.
[00:59:55.960 --> 00:59:57.480]   You're walking down the street.
[00:59:57.480 --> 00:59:58.480]   Yeah.
[00:59:58.480 --> 01:00:01.360]   But the normal microphones that are very crazy.
[01:00:01.360 --> 01:00:06.480]   I just think people got tired of weird sounding, but normal microphones because it was cool
[01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:08.920]   for a while that it was like, okay, I get it.
[01:00:08.920 --> 01:00:11.280]   There's a street and there's a person going by on the right.
[01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:12.280]   There's a car on the left.
[01:00:12.280 --> 01:00:14.400]   It's just a little much, you know.
[01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:16.320]   How funny, I completely forgot about that.
[01:00:16.320 --> 01:00:17.320]   That was neat.
[01:00:17.320 --> 01:00:18.320]   You know, I have to think about that.
[01:00:18.320 --> 01:00:19.320]   I have to think about that.
[01:00:19.320 --> 01:00:20.320]   Yeah.
[01:00:20.320 --> 01:00:23.280]   Because when I record, I always record the guest and one channel and me and the other.
[01:00:23.280 --> 01:00:27.440]   So we are stereo to begin with, but if the guest really need to be, you know, sitting
[01:00:27.440 --> 01:00:29.040]   all the way to my left or all the way to my right.
[01:00:29.040 --> 01:00:30.040]   No, no, you want to pan it extremely.
[01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:31.040]   No, but you can separately.
[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:35.440]   You can do the levels and process their audio separately from your own.
[01:00:35.440 --> 01:00:37.960]   John, are we stereo, right?
[01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:40.640]   But we don't pan people's mics.
[01:00:40.640 --> 01:00:45.120]   So everybody's all, we probably should, but everybody's all kind of coming in the same
[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:46.120]   place.
[01:00:46.120 --> 01:00:47.120]   There are reasons not to do that.
[01:00:47.120 --> 01:00:52.120]   If you're in the car, for instance, all you're going to get with too much space, it's great
[01:00:52.120 --> 01:00:56.080]   if you listen to headphones or a good sound system, but in a car, it's come, people are
[01:00:56.080 --> 01:00:57.080]   going to be louder than other people.
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:58.880]   It's just going to be, it's not going to make a lot of sense.
[01:00:58.880 --> 01:01:00.720]   So I don't know.
[01:01:00.720 --> 01:01:02.440]   I have mixed feelings.
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:07.520]   I prefer to make it sound like an AM boss, Jack from 1968.
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:09.240]   That's my goal.
[01:01:09.240 --> 01:01:11.240]   That Jack is my answer.
[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:12.240]   All right.
[01:01:12.240 --> 01:01:14.040]   I've got it.
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:16.240]   That's bad.
[01:01:16.240 --> 01:01:23.280]   But yeah, you know, we did, we did a spatial audio podcast many years ago that was really
[01:01:23.280 --> 01:01:24.280]   cool.
[01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:25.280]   Adobe.
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:26.280]   I'm sorry, Dolby.
[01:01:26.280 --> 01:01:28.880]   It's easy to confuse the two.
[01:01:28.880 --> 01:01:35.560]   Dudley had a technology they called Dolby Headphone that didn't take off.
[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:40.240]   It's gone now, but it was kind of like the atmos mix that they do now for.
[01:01:40.240 --> 01:01:45.680]   That's what spatial is, is an atmos mix where you can place sounds anywhere in a sound stage.
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:51.000]   And we did a whole show using Dolby Headphone that nobody could listen to because unless
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:54.160]   you're in a Dolby Headphone decoder, it didn't make any sense.
[01:01:54.160 --> 01:01:55.160]   And now it's spatial is big.
[01:01:55.160 --> 01:01:57.240]   Maybe we should do spatial mixes of our shows.
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:01:58.240]   I don't know.
[01:01:58.240 --> 01:01:59.240]   What do you think, Shelley?
[01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:00.240]   Shelley, would you?
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:04.400]   I think that would be really trippy and I probably would just go back to mind myself.
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:05.400]   Yeah.
[01:02:05.400 --> 01:02:10.120]   Shelley's coming in from the upper right, Lisa's and the lower left.
[01:02:10.120 --> 01:02:13.360]   I'm behind you and Larry's in front of you.
[01:02:13.360 --> 01:02:14.360]   Look out.
[01:02:14.360 --> 01:02:18.440]   It doesn't work in my house because I have an Eichler with a pretty tall ceiling and
[01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:20.640]   the atmos gets just drowned out in there.
[01:02:20.640 --> 01:02:21.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:02:21.640 --> 01:02:22.640]   You can't have apples.
[01:02:22.640 --> 01:02:26.400]   You can have a flat, low reflective ceiling.
[01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:30.600]   Unless you put speakers up there and then you make them loud enough so that it's going
[01:02:30.600 --> 01:02:31.600]   to work.
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:33.800]   But that seems one more thing for my wife to get into the Eichler.
[01:02:33.800 --> 01:02:34.800]   Don't do that in Eichler.
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:35.800]   Sound design your house.
[01:02:35.800 --> 01:02:36.800]   That's a little much, right?
[01:02:36.800 --> 01:02:39.120]   That's another point is how are people listening?
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:43.680]   So I'm going to guess a lot of people are listening on mono speakers, right?
[01:02:43.680 --> 01:02:44.680]   They're listening on...
[01:02:44.680 --> 01:02:45.680]   Or headphones.
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:47.680]   Well, head for the last year, butts.
[01:02:47.680 --> 01:02:48.680]   Yeah, you're right.
[01:02:48.680 --> 01:02:50.840]   Well, as mono speakers, I mean, think about voice assistants.
[01:02:50.840 --> 01:02:54.160]   They're listening on A-lady boxes, Google boxes.
[01:02:54.160 --> 01:02:55.160]   That's true.
[01:02:55.160 --> 01:02:56.160]   Yeah, even...
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:57.160]   Because we've gone...
[01:02:57.160 --> 01:02:58.200]   Car radios used to be mono.
[01:02:58.200 --> 01:02:59.200]   They're not anymore.
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:00.200]   There are a lot of people.
[01:03:00.200 --> 01:03:03.480]   Most people have access to some sort of stereo-based audio if they want to listen to it.
[01:03:03.480 --> 01:03:04.680]   But how do we really listen to it?
[01:03:04.680 --> 01:03:08.840]   I listen to my show every day on a mono speaker because that's what I have.
[01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:09.840]   Yeah, it's easy.
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:10.840]   Easy.
[01:03:10.840 --> 01:03:12.480]   I'm just lazy.
[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:16.640]   If I had energy, I would do a soundscape.
[01:03:16.640 --> 01:03:21.960]   I would...when I was a younger radio guy, I used love to mix in stuff.
[01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:22.960]   I remember...
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:25.120]   Like the birds chirping in the background if you're doing...
[01:03:25.120 --> 01:03:26.120]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:03:26.120 --> 01:03:27.120]   Or, you know...
[01:03:27.120 --> 01:03:29.080]   I mean, we do that when we make mixes.
[01:03:29.080 --> 01:03:30.080]   Yeah.
[01:03:30.080 --> 01:03:32.480]   If I go out and I interview somebody...
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:33.480]   I love that.
[01:03:33.480 --> 01:03:35.960]   And I...or several people, and we get ambient sound.
[01:03:35.960 --> 01:03:38.080]   We in fact, we lay a track underneath.
[01:03:38.080 --> 01:03:41.200]   It's the birds chirping or the gravel crunching or whatever.
[01:03:41.200 --> 01:03:42.800]   And you fade that in and you fade it out.
[01:03:42.800 --> 01:03:44.160]   And it sounds really great.
[01:03:44.160 --> 01:03:48.280]   But you also have to be really...we record those in...you know, we do multi-track and
[01:03:48.280 --> 01:03:51.840]   then we mix them down to stereo and they end up on the show in stereo.
[01:03:51.840 --> 01:03:56.040]   Most people don't get most of it, but some people are going to hear the subtleties of
[01:03:56.040 --> 01:03:57.040]   it.
[01:03:57.040 --> 01:04:00.120]   And it's fun to do as long as you don't go crazy with it.
[01:04:00.120 --> 01:04:03.280]   And as long as you're doing it honestly, long as the natural sound goes.
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:04.280]   Exactly.
[01:04:04.280 --> 01:04:06.600]   I mean, from where you are and not imported from another world.
[01:04:06.600 --> 01:04:08.320]   We wouldn't do that.
[01:04:08.320 --> 01:04:09.320]   No.
[01:04:09.320 --> 01:04:10.320]   Of course you wouldn't.
[01:04:10.320 --> 01:04:11.320]   But I...
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:12.800]   I had to take a whole ethics class about that.
[01:04:12.800 --> 01:04:14.640]   Well, that's because you're doing journalism.
[01:04:14.640 --> 01:04:21.280]   But I mean, there's also a whole sphere of shows that could be considered fiction.
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:22.280]   Like serial.
[01:04:22.280 --> 01:04:23.280]   Oh yeah.
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:24.280]   Yeah.
[01:04:24.280 --> 01:04:25.280]   And then you could do, for example.
[01:04:25.280 --> 01:04:27.600]   And then you could...or twit.
[01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:28.600]   And then you could...
[01:04:28.600 --> 01:04:29.600]   Night Vale radio drama.
[01:04:29.600 --> 01:04:30.600]   Night Vale is a good example.
[01:04:30.600 --> 01:04:31.600]   They actually quite a few.
[01:04:31.600 --> 01:04:32.600]   Yeah.
[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:35.520]   They've re-popularized radio drama as a podcast.
[01:04:35.520 --> 01:04:36.520]   I love that.
[01:04:36.520 --> 01:04:41.760]   And I think the problem is it's a huge amount of work and it's very time consuming.
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:45.240]   It's almost like content doesn't scale that you need.
[01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:46.240]   It's handcrafted.
[01:04:46.240 --> 01:04:49.320]   Well, they call it sound design.
[01:04:49.320 --> 01:04:54.840]   And I mean, there are people who are quite expert at it and take a lot of care.
[01:04:54.840 --> 01:04:57.760]   And for 90% of the content that's out there, it's not needed.
[01:04:57.760 --> 01:05:00.320]   But it's like special effects in video.
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:04.920]   It's that extra oof that you add to content that needs it.
[01:05:04.920 --> 01:05:09.600]   But don't put it on my little radio stories about voting by mail or whatever it is I'm
[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:10.600]   writing.
[01:05:10.600 --> 01:05:14.080]   And I'm not going to do that conscious decision because I love that.
[01:05:14.080 --> 01:05:18.520]   And if I didn't have to make a living and I didn't have any other interests in the world,
[01:05:18.520 --> 01:05:24.760]   I might spend a lot of time doing sound design and creating, you know, like Ken Nordine's
[01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:26.240]   soundscapes and stuff.
[01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:27.240]   Oh my God.
[01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:28.240]   Most Ken Nordine.
[01:05:28.240 --> 01:05:32.720]   I like turning younger people on to Ken Nordine because people have never heard of him and
[01:05:32.720 --> 01:05:33.720]   he's amazing.
[01:05:33.720 --> 01:05:34.720]   Amazing.
[01:05:34.720 --> 01:05:40.080]   One of the things I learned from listening to the original series of material was all
[01:05:40.080 --> 01:05:45.680]   of the things that I used to do to make my podcast quote better were the very things
[01:05:45.680 --> 01:05:46.840]   that they weren't doing.
[01:05:46.840 --> 01:05:51.120]   Like I would cut out pauses and they would put in pauses.
[01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:54.600]   And I would try to avoid ums and awws and all these things.
[01:05:54.600 --> 01:06:00.200]   And it actually turns out it can actually add to the authenticness of what you do.
[01:06:00.200 --> 01:06:06.320]   It's a thin line because it can sound affected and it can sound a little precious and a bit
[01:06:06.320 --> 01:06:07.320]   different.
[01:06:07.320 --> 01:06:11.600]   And like that's a very sort of public radio kind of sound.
[01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:13.920]   It's I'm glad you said it's a line.
[01:06:13.920 --> 01:06:14.920]   I'm glad you said it's a line.
[01:06:14.920 --> 01:06:15.920]   No.
[01:06:15.920 --> 01:06:16.920]   I'm glad you said it's a line.
[01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:17.920]   I'm glad you said it's a line.
[01:06:17.920 --> 01:06:18.920]   But there's a tendency.
[01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:20.920]   And we edited it for those 45 second beats.
[01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:24.160]   But what we, you know, our show is fairly new.
[01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:28.120]   I haven't been around for the entire entirety of the show, but when they debated the show
[01:06:28.120 --> 01:06:32.800]   seven years ago, one of the goals was we're public radio, but we're not trying to sound
[01:06:32.800 --> 01:06:34.200]   like the NPR mothership.
[01:06:34.200 --> 01:06:37.120]   We want to sound like what what Texas sounds like.
[01:06:37.120 --> 01:06:39.120]   And that doesn't mean everybody says y'all all the time.
[01:06:39.120 --> 01:06:43.640]   It just means that there's a little more of a laid back sort of conversational aspect
[01:06:43.640 --> 01:06:49.280]   to it, but we're not going the other direction and being unserious or trying to be precious
[01:06:49.280 --> 01:06:53.200]   about like sounding too folksy and too authentic.
[01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:57.600]   And it's a, it's a line and you, you just make editorial decisions about how do you want
[01:06:57.600 --> 01:06:59.400]   your show to sound and what's, what's authenticity?
[01:06:59.400 --> 01:07:02.600]   That's what it gets, it gets down to is like your perception of authenticity.
[01:07:02.600 --> 01:07:06.920]   So that was kind of the decision I made is that we want to get, we want to make, we do
[01:07:06.920 --> 01:07:07.920]   this as live as possible.
[01:07:07.920 --> 01:07:11.440]   It's one of the reasons we do it live with a live chatroom and we used to have a live
[01:07:11.440 --> 01:07:14.440]   audience so that it's not edited.
[01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:15.640]   It's not sound design.
[01:07:15.640 --> 01:07:17.960]   It's the opposite.
[01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:21.320]   And for the content that we're doing, I thought that was the best way to do it.
[01:07:21.320 --> 01:07:23.800]   And also because I come from a live radio background.
[01:07:23.800 --> 01:07:25.560]   But let me, let me play.
[01:07:25.560 --> 01:07:26.960]   Let's introduce Shelley.
[01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:28.880]   Let's introduce people to Ken Nordine.
[01:07:28.880 --> 01:07:32.040]   So he was a, was he from Chicago?
[01:07:32.040 --> 01:07:33.040]   Chicago, I think.
[01:07:33.040 --> 01:07:34.040]   Yeah.
[01:07:34.040 --> 01:07:40.960]   Radio personality who had a very beautiful voice and was very influenced by the 50s jazz
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:44.400]   improvisation, hipster stuff.
[01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:46.920]   There's actually a ton of Ken Nordine stuff on YouTube.
[01:07:46.920 --> 01:07:49.880]   I hope this isn't going to get us taken down.
[01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:52.880]   Let me play just going to say where you, what rabbit holes are going to take you down, Leo?
[01:07:52.880 --> 01:07:53.880]   Well, it's all right.
[01:07:53.880 --> 01:07:54.880]   We're already in the rabbit hole.
[01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:57.240]   This is just, I'll play just a few seconds of this.
[01:07:57.240 --> 01:07:59.680]   This is from his word jazz album.
[01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:01.280]   It's called What Time Is It?
[01:08:01.280 --> 01:08:04.840]   You'll get immediate idea of what we're talking about here.
[01:08:04.840 --> 01:08:08.880]   There was this guy who was a regular guy who lived a regular life.
[01:08:08.880 --> 01:08:09.880]   Got up.
[01:08:09.880 --> 01:08:11.840]   Seven thirty every morning.
[01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:13.600]   At the same breakfast.
[01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:15.800]   Kissed the same wife.
[01:08:15.800 --> 01:08:21.400]   I'll let you, I'll leave this as an exercise for the listener to pursue that.
[01:08:21.400 --> 01:08:24.200]   Look up Ken Nordine and you can find a lot of stuff.
[01:08:24.200 --> 01:08:25.960]   He's, I want to know what his audio settings are.
[01:08:25.960 --> 01:08:26.960]   I'm so curious.
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:28.840]   Oh, well he had a beautiful, beautiful voice.
[01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:32.040]   I know he did, but there's some processing in there and it's great.
[01:08:32.040 --> 01:08:33.040]   Yeah.
[01:08:33.040 --> 01:08:35.760]   This is ultra high fidelity.
[01:08:35.760 --> 01:08:39.800]   It says, doesn't say stereo however.
[01:08:39.800 --> 01:08:41.480]   So I don't, I don't know.
[01:08:41.480 --> 01:08:42.480]   Ultra.
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:43.480]   Good word.
[01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:44.480]   Ultra.
[01:08:44.480 --> 01:08:48.680]   He was, maybe you might say, I think I know that voice.
[01:08:48.680 --> 01:08:50.040]   He did ads too.
[01:08:50.040 --> 01:08:52.880]   He did a very famous, and I'm going to play a little bit of it.
[01:08:52.880 --> 01:08:54.360]   Levi's jeans ad.
[01:08:54.360 --> 01:08:55.360]   Yes, yes.
[01:08:55.360 --> 01:08:56.680]   Oh, somebody mentioned that in the chat.
[01:08:56.680 --> 01:09:04.600]   That was extremely popular in 19, I want to say early 70s, early 70s, maybe.
[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:05.600]   Let's play it.
[01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:06.600]   This is very trippy.
[01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:09.720]   It was a strange one came into our town.
[01:09:09.720 --> 01:09:13.960]   It was tall and the eyes that could look right to the bottom of you.
[01:09:13.960 --> 01:09:18.280]   We might have welcomed him except for one thing, his pants.
[01:09:18.280 --> 01:09:22.200]   I'll leave you, I'll leave you wondering.
[01:09:22.200 --> 01:09:25.520]   That commercial is on a real Ralph Bashki feel to it.
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:29.560]   It did the animation with the rotoscoping and the animation.
[01:09:29.560 --> 01:09:32.480]   Yeah, it was, it was a leefice commercial.
[01:09:32.480 --> 01:09:34.240]   No, I want to watch the trip.
[01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:39.000]   Yeah, the late legendary Ken Nordine who does this, I agree with you, Shelley deserves a
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.000]   lot more attention.
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:43.760]   This is a delight.
[01:09:43.760 --> 01:09:44.760]   Let's take a little break.
[01:09:44.760 --> 01:09:45.920]   We'll come back.
[01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:50.720]   There is a lot more to talk about and we're just getting to the heart of the matter.
[01:09:50.720 --> 01:09:56.960]   First, since you were talking about a VPN and protecting yourself online, Larry, I thought
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:00.640]   I mentioned our VPN sponsor Express VPN.
[01:10:00.640 --> 01:10:03.120]   It's the only VPN I use.
[01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:07.120]   The one I trust, people ask me all the time, how do you know that you could trust Express
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:08.120]   VPN?
[01:10:08.120 --> 01:10:09.200]   This is important.
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:16.000]   The reason you will use a VPN, of course, is to, for a sec, there's really three good
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:22.160]   reasons to use a VPN, to keep people from hacking you, watching what you're doing at
[01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:23.160]   a coffee shop.
[01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:24.600]   That's how we started using VPNs.
[01:10:24.600 --> 01:10:27.960]   Actually, we started them in business, right, so that you could use the company network
[01:10:27.960 --> 01:10:32.080]   safely, even if you weren't on premises.
[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:33.080]   You also use it.
[01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:39.400]   Sometimes people use it for geographic relocation so you can watch videos on Netflix UK or watch
[01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:43.440]   all the Mica you want on Netflix, Japan.
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:46.160]   But the reason a lot of people these days use it and the reason you're using it Larry
[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:47.680]   is for privacy.
[01:10:47.680 --> 01:10:51.840]   But it's important to understand that yes, your ISP can't see what you're doing.
[01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:53.560]   You're hiding yourself.
[01:10:53.560 --> 01:10:58.760]   You're using a different IP address when you visit a website.
[01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:02.760]   But the people who can see what you're doing are the VPN company, the server you're coming
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:03.760]   out of.
[01:11:03.760 --> 01:11:06.480]   So it's very important that you trust the VPN provider.
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:09.280]   Express VPN, I trust them implicitly.
[01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:13.240]   Of course they have the third party audits, but they've actually engineered their own
[01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:15.720]   VPN protocol.
[01:11:15.720 --> 01:11:21.280]   It's called lightweight to keep your data secure without sacrificing speed.
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:23.400]   And we know that they don't do any logging.
[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:27.880]   They use and there was just an article about this on bleeping computer, a custom Debian
[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:32.200]   distribution that re wipes itself every day.
[01:11:32.200 --> 01:11:34.440]   Every reboot, everything's wiped from the drive.
[01:11:34.440 --> 01:11:37.480]   There's nothing there in the logs.
[01:11:37.480 --> 01:11:42.440]   And it launches its VPN server in memory and RAM.
[01:11:42.440 --> 01:11:45.000]   So that sandbox, so it can't write to the drive.
[01:11:45.000 --> 01:11:49.960]   So they take all these extra steps to make sure that there is zero logging.
[01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:51.800]   They are not keeping track of what you're doing.
[01:11:51.800 --> 01:11:56.520]   They can't, they couldn't even if they wanted to express VPN is awesome.
[01:11:56.520 --> 01:12:00.800]   It is the way to protect yourself online.
[01:12:00.800 --> 01:12:05.280]   They do their own special protocol express VPN so fast.
[01:12:05.280 --> 01:12:09.000]   You can put it on your router.
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.200]   It actually works on a number of routers.
[01:12:11.200 --> 01:12:16.000]   The whole family protected, they won't even know because there's no speed degradation.
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:18.720]   It's really awesome.
[01:12:18.720 --> 01:12:24.520]   This level of bespoke technology is what allows Express VPN to provide superior speeds and
[01:12:24.520 --> 01:12:26.480]   enhanced privacy and protection.
[01:12:26.480 --> 01:12:27.480]   They really care.
[01:12:27.480 --> 01:12:30.000]   They work really hard and lightweight.
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.480]   Their own protocol is open source.
[01:12:32.480 --> 01:12:35.360]   Of course, it's been audited by third parties.
[01:12:35.360 --> 01:12:38.200]   You can look at it yourself.
[01:12:38.200 --> 01:12:41.640]   So if you're, you know, that's one way, I think you've got to use software that's open
[01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:44.360]   source if you want to protect your security and privacy.
[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:48.000]   Otherwise, you know, who knows what kind of back doors are in there, not with Express
[01:12:48.000 --> 01:12:49.000]   VPN.
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:55.400]   It's 2022 folks in case you didn't know, you need to use a VPN when you go online.
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:58.080]   You need to protect your privacy and your security.
[01:12:58.080 --> 01:13:04.000]   If you don't have one yet, even if you do, I want you to go to expressvpn.com/twit.
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:07.360]   When you buy a one year package, they're going to give you three extra months free.
[01:13:07.360 --> 01:13:09.000]   That brings it down to below seven bucks a month.
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.520]   I think that's a very fair price for what you get.
[01:13:12.520 --> 01:13:16.840]   Please don't use free VPNs because if they're not charging you, they're finding another
[01:13:16.840 --> 01:13:18.720]   way to make money.
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:24.000]   eXPR, essvpn.com/twit.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:26.720]   And read up on all the technologies and all the things they're doing that.
[01:13:26.720 --> 01:13:31.960]   Well, I think reassure you as it has me that these guys are going the extra mile to give
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:36.240]   you a VPN that is truly private and secure.
[01:13:36.240 --> 01:13:39.040]   Expressvpn.com/twit.
[01:13:39.040 --> 01:13:41.520]   We thank them so much for their support of our show.
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:44.520]   They've been a longtime supporter of the network.
[01:13:44.520 --> 01:13:48.680]   Only VPN I use and trust expressvpn.com.
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:50.680]   Thank you, Express VPN.
[01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:52.560]   All right.
[01:13:52.560 --> 01:13:54.360]   Let's see here.
[01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:58.800]   We never really decide whether Figma should be the Figma acquisition should be allowed.
[01:13:58.800 --> 01:14:00.600]   That's for the lawyers.
[01:14:00.600 --> 01:14:01.600]   That's up to the lawyers.
[01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:06.040]   I would love to see the argument for it where they're saying this represents a substantial
[01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:07.600]   threat to the market.
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:11.440]   We were talking about a serial, the serial podcast.
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:17.840]   That's in the news this week because the serial, the subject of the very first series
[01:14:17.840 --> 01:14:19.880]   was released from prison.
[01:14:19.880 --> 01:14:20.880]   Yeah.
[01:14:20.880 --> 01:14:21.880]   Yeah.
[01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:22.880]   Wow.
[01:14:22.880 --> 01:14:28.400]   I think that's the most success any podcast has ever achieved to actually get somebody.
[01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:29.400]   So what's the story?
[01:14:29.400 --> 01:14:31.120]   Because I did not listen to serial.
[01:14:31.120 --> 01:14:32.880]   His name is Adnan Said.
[01:14:32.880 --> 01:14:40.840]   He was a high school student when he was convicted of murdering his high school sweetheart.
[01:14:40.840 --> 01:14:45.120]   He's been serving a life sentence.
[01:14:45.120 --> 01:14:54.680]   The judge said, I think based on the revelations from serial that the prosecution of the original
[01:14:54.680 --> 01:14:59.560]   trial withheld evidence didn't give him a fair trial.
[01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:04.800]   His own attorney who has since passed was maybe a little suspect as well.
[01:15:04.800 --> 01:15:09.520]   The judge didn't say, I quit you, go be free.
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:15.240]   He just said, we need to give you a new trial in the interest of justice and fairness.
[01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:16.240]   You need a new trial.
[01:15:16.240 --> 01:15:17.640]   Now he may not ever get tried again.
[01:15:17.640 --> 01:15:22.160]   Prosecutors have 30 days to decide if they're going to proceed with a new trial or just
[01:15:22.160 --> 01:15:23.840]   drop the charges.
[01:15:23.840 --> 01:15:26.760]   He's currently at home detention.
[01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:32.640]   Of course, the family of his high school sweetheart, Heyman Lee is very unhappy because
[01:15:32.640 --> 01:15:34.960]   they believe he did it.
[01:15:34.960 --> 01:15:36.960]   Now I didn't listen anybody who's listening to serial.
[01:15:36.960 --> 01:15:39.160]   Yeah, I listened to a lot of this episode.
[01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:40.760]   Do you think what do you think?
[01:15:40.760 --> 01:15:45.600]   Well, you know, based on the episodes and I've not independently researched the case.
[01:15:45.600 --> 01:15:48.280]   So I want to be respectful of the family's concerns.
[01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:53.360]   But based on the podcast, it seemed like definitely he's doing a new trial because there was
[01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:57.080]   a lot of questions about whether someone else might have done it.
[01:15:57.080 --> 01:16:02.280]   They presented a lot of evidence, which I think most juries would agree would certainly
[01:16:02.280 --> 01:16:04.160]   put into question this guy's guilt.
[01:16:04.160 --> 01:16:06.640]   And yet he has been sitting in prison all this year.
[01:16:06.640 --> 01:16:10.840]   So it's a great example of, I don't know whether you call it investigative journalism
[01:16:10.840 --> 01:16:12.640]   or advocacy journalism.
[01:16:12.640 --> 01:16:18.240]   I don't believe that the serial podcast took a position on guilt or innocence, but it kind
[01:16:18.240 --> 01:16:23.240]   of made the case that there this guy probably at least deserves another trial.
[01:16:23.240 --> 01:16:24.440]   And I'm glad he's getting one.
[01:16:24.440 --> 01:16:25.920]   That seems fair.
[01:16:25.920 --> 01:16:26.920]   That seems fair.
[01:16:26.920 --> 01:16:28.680]   They're not saying he's innocent.
[01:16:28.680 --> 01:16:33.200]   Although really that I've told that the joy of listening to this serial was debating.
[01:16:33.200 --> 01:16:35.440]   Oh, he didn't do it.
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:36.440]   Oh, he did it.
[01:16:36.440 --> 01:16:37.440]   No, he didn't do it.
[01:16:37.440 --> 01:16:38.440]   Yeah, you were back fourth.
[01:16:38.440 --> 01:16:39.440]   Yeah.
[01:16:39.440 --> 01:16:45.640]   Twelve episodes back in 2014, the New York Times has since purchased serial.
[01:16:45.640 --> 01:16:52.560]   So they're putting out a new episode called Adnan is out.
[01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:54.520]   Sarah Koenig, who did produce it.
[01:16:54.520 --> 01:16:59.000]   Really I think in some ways, podcasting was already 10 years old by the time she did this,
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:00.920]   but in some ways put podcasting in the map.
[01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:01.920]   It was huge.
[01:17:01.920 --> 01:17:06.400]   It actually had a big impact on CBS because people, I've been pushing podcasting and
[01:17:06.400 --> 01:17:08.000]   seeing the since the 90s.
[01:17:08.000 --> 01:17:11.240]   And they would basically laugh at me back then.
[01:17:11.240 --> 01:17:15.960]   And I think serial really opened up the eyes of the entire broadcast industry that this
[01:17:15.960 --> 01:17:18.560]   technology needs to be explored.
[01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:20.520]   Well, it's certainly all of those.
[01:17:20.520 --> 01:17:23.400]   It's an audience that's worth courting, I think is what it proved.
[01:17:23.400 --> 01:17:24.600]   Well, and it was huge.
[01:17:24.600 --> 01:17:25.600]   It was millions.
[01:17:25.600 --> 01:17:26.600]   It was in the millions.
[01:17:26.600 --> 01:17:30.240]   So I mean, that was, that was, you know, that's a substantial number.
[01:17:30.240 --> 01:17:34.640]   He also created a wave for better or worse of true crime podcasts.
[01:17:34.640 --> 01:17:35.640]   Yeah.
[01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:36.640]   Yeah.
[01:17:36.640 --> 01:17:39.560]   Everybody was copying this, right?
[01:17:39.560 --> 01:17:44.480]   I wonder if serial, serial camera round at the right place in the right time, but it
[01:17:44.480 --> 01:17:49.800]   also was a sweet spot for people who are already habituated to crime as a narrative like you
[01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:57.280]   have on lawn order shows or the shows on the CSI shows or, what does that show that Keith
[01:17:57.280 --> 01:17:59.480]   Morris, Nightlight Dateline?
[01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:00.480]   Yeah, Dateline.
[01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:01.480]   Yeah.
[01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:02.480]   So much better.
[01:18:02.480 --> 01:18:03.480]   I mean, a marathon.
[01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:04.480]   I hate to.
[01:18:04.480 --> 01:18:09.520]   I always think of Bill Hader's impersonation of Keith Morris, which is just damaging because
[01:18:09.520 --> 01:18:14.400]   I'm sure Keith Morris is a fine journalist, but all I can see is Bill Hader.
[01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:16.120]   Wow.
[01:18:16.120 --> 01:18:22.400]   But Americans as an audience love thinking of crime as a form of entertainment, whether
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:25.280]   it's puzzle box mystery solving or straightforward morality.
[01:18:25.280 --> 01:18:26.480]   The British do too.
[01:18:26.480 --> 01:18:27.480]   Yeah.
[01:18:27.480 --> 01:18:28.480]   British, you watch Brit TV.
[01:18:28.480 --> 01:18:29.600]   They're all over the sentence.
[01:18:29.600 --> 01:18:33.400]   And true crime is this huge element of podcasting now.
[01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:38.040]   And there's actually been a fair bit of backlash to serial because there are people who actually
[01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:43.720]   believe that serial did not give Adnan Sayed a fair shake in terms of there's some evidence
[01:18:43.720 --> 01:18:46.440]   on serial that has since been disputed.
[01:18:46.440 --> 01:18:47.440]   Oh, really?
[01:18:47.440 --> 01:18:48.440]   Yeah.
[01:18:48.440 --> 01:18:51.200]   And that's some of the backlash that sort of came out this week.
[01:18:51.200 --> 01:18:52.920]   And I'm not really up on all of that.
[01:18:52.920 --> 01:18:55.160]   I was a little surprised by it.
[01:18:55.160 --> 01:19:01.080]   But what's interesting about that is just the degree to which the perception is that
[01:19:01.080 --> 01:19:07.160]   they were going after a dramatic narrative and didn't necessarily do all of the homework
[01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:10.520]   that they should have in there's been criticism of the New York Times that they didn't do updates
[01:19:10.520 --> 01:19:11.800]   sooner.
[01:19:11.800 --> 01:19:15.080]   So there's a lot of moving parts to it.
[01:19:15.080 --> 01:19:21.360]   And I think the true crime aspect of it and the degree to which the true crime fascination
[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:27.160]   is kind of a gentrified, let's peel to a certain demographic of people who are interested
[01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:31.400]   in crime podcasts is sort of an unfortunate side effect of it.
[01:19:31.400 --> 01:19:33.960]   And again, I didn't and still haven't listened to it.
[01:19:33.960 --> 01:19:34.960]   I probably should.
[01:19:34.960 --> 01:19:40.280]   But it strikes me, you know, Sarah Koenig was a producer on This American Life, which
[01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:44.440]   is I've always said the best radio show ever made.
[01:19:44.440 --> 01:19:50.280]   And except for the Texas standard, which is a fabulous, fabulous show.
[01:19:50.280 --> 01:19:55.920]   You can come on to the California report is a really great audio show too.
[01:19:55.920 --> 01:20:02.720]   I also got the sense that the focus her focus in Syria was telling a good story.
[01:20:02.720 --> 01:20:06.280]   It wasn't and that's what's true about this American life as well.
[01:20:06.280 --> 01:20:10.680]   It's not journalism in the sense of, well, we want to present you with the facts.
[01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:16.320]   It was let's make, you know, there were cliffhangers, let's make a gripping story.
[01:20:16.320 --> 01:20:22.240]   And that's when journalism bleeds into fiction or storytelling.
[01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:24.240]   And I don't know if I like that.
[01:20:24.240 --> 01:20:31.440]   Well, it's the New York has done that with some long form reporting too.
[01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:37.040]   The qualm I throw up there is when you reduce reporting, not reduce, but when you include
[01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:42.720]   the element of entertainment in reporting, sometimes the facts get in the way of a good
[01:20:42.720 --> 01:20:43.720]   story.
[01:20:43.720 --> 01:20:44.720]   Because you focus on, well, is this entertaining?
[01:20:44.720 --> 01:20:45.720]   Yeah.
[01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:46.720]   Yeah.
[01:20:46.720 --> 01:20:48.160]   Well, and are you, have you hit your cliffhanger?
[01:20:48.160 --> 01:20:52.000]   You have X number of episodes, maybe it's 13, whatever the series is.
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:54.440]   Are you going to have a cliffhanger for one of those episodes?
[01:20:54.440 --> 01:20:59.040]   And how are you going to come to a stop, especially if the person you're focusing on
[01:20:59.040 --> 01:21:00.040]   is in jail?
[01:21:00.040 --> 01:21:03.680]   And don't forget, the person who lost her life still lost her life.
[01:21:03.680 --> 01:21:08.480]   However your show comes out and whether this person is innocent or guilty, that family
[01:21:08.480 --> 01:21:09.960]   doesn't have a resolution yet.
[01:21:09.960 --> 01:21:10.960]   Right.
[01:21:10.960 --> 01:21:13.480]   I would love a podcast from the perspective of the people who are like, my loved one
[01:21:13.480 --> 01:21:15.680]   was turned into fodder for a true crime podcast.
[01:21:15.680 --> 01:21:16.680]   Oh, wow.
[01:21:16.680 --> 01:21:17.680]   Wouldn't that be a show?
[01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:21.960]   Well, we don't see these folks who are like, my loved one had the same.
[01:21:21.960 --> 01:21:25.120]   This terrible ending.
[01:21:25.120 --> 01:21:28.760]   The complexity of who they were has been reduced to them being the object of someone
[01:21:28.760 --> 01:21:32.040]   else's story that is being presented as more interesting.
[01:21:32.040 --> 01:21:36.800]   And I have to constantly re-litigate this experience as this podcast comes out every
[01:21:36.800 --> 01:21:37.800]   week.
[01:21:37.800 --> 01:21:42.320]   Like, if you're going to have a true crime universe, you should point out the ripple
[01:21:42.320 --> 01:21:43.320]   effects, I think.
[01:21:43.320 --> 01:21:47.320]   It shouldn't just be these stories about, did so and so do it pause.
[01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:51.920]   But you remember date lines to catch a predator series back in the late, I think, with
[01:21:51.920 --> 01:21:57.360]   the early 2000s and it ended when one of their suspects committed suicide.
[01:21:57.360 --> 01:22:01.880]   They showed up with a vigilante squad and the guy killed himself.
[01:22:01.880 --> 01:22:06.960]   And it probably wouldn't have happened if they let the police investigate that alleged
[01:22:06.960 --> 01:22:12.000]   child predator rather than having a bunch of vigilantes and not particularly careful
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:13.480]   journalists do it.
[01:22:13.480 --> 01:22:14.480]   Yeah.
[01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:21.560]   I mean, we've seen citizen journalism and the ugly side of it on Reddit many, many times.
[01:22:21.560 --> 01:22:24.240]   So the election was stolen.
[01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:26.760]   We get perfect.
[01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:36.240]   So I just, I mean, every, so is it, it's certainly painted as in fiction and nonfiction and
[01:22:36.240 --> 01:22:41.920]   journalism, the case that the police sometimes, this is that Duke and the stats are more interested
[01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:46.800]   in finding a resolution than finding the actual culprit.
[01:22:46.800 --> 01:22:49.080]   I don't know how true that is.
[01:22:49.080 --> 01:22:53.160]   If I were a police officer, I would, I would not be looking for resolution unless I knew
[01:22:53.160 --> 01:22:56.400]   it was sure that that was the person who did it because then you're letting the person
[01:22:56.400 --> 01:22:57.640]   who did it walk free.
[01:22:57.640 --> 01:22:58.640]   Right.
[01:22:58.640 --> 01:22:59.640]   That's bad.
[01:22:59.640 --> 01:23:00.920]   But, but I don't know.
[01:23:00.920 --> 01:23:01.920]   So that's one thing.
[01:23:01.920 --> 01:23:05.600]   You get the impression that, well, prosecutors in the police are just looking to for their
[01:23:05.600 --> 01:23:06.600]   stats.
[01:23:06.600 --> 01:23:07.600]   They're not trying to solve the crime.
[01:23:07.600 --> 01:23:08.600]   But it's not there.
[01:23:08.600 --> 01:23:12.000]   The proof is a really, it can be an onerous duty.
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:18.400]   If you've ever gone to jury duty for a criminal trial, you will sit there and the judge and
[01:23:18.400 --> 01:23:24.440]   the prosecutor will tell you our job that owing to the premise that you are innocent
[01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:29.480]   until found guilty, it is the burden of the prosecution to have to say this evidence
[01:23:29.480 --> 01:23:31.400]   points this conclusion and it cannot be repeated.
[01:23:31.400 --> 01:23:33.120]   Beyond the reasonable doubt.
[01:23:33.120 --> 01:23:34.120]   Exactly.
[01:23:34.120 --> 01:23:37.200]   That's a high bar to clear.
[01:23:37.200 --> 01:23:39.840]   And I'm going to argue that in some ways it's good that it's a high bar.
[01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:40.920]   It's designed that way.
[01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:41.920]   But what we saw, is it better?
[01:23:41.920 --> 01:23:42.920]   Is it worse?
[01:23:42.920 --> 01:23:46.720]   But what we see though is people who are trying to figure out ways to either walk around
[01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:51.040]   the bar or say, okay, we can carefully lift a leg over the bar in a technicality.
[01:23:51.040 --> 01:23:57.960]   Is it worse to falsely convict somebody of a crime or worse to let a criminal go free?
[01:23:57.960 --> 01:24:05.240]   And I think we've, as a country, we have decided it's better to err on the side of caution
[01:24:05.240 --> 01:24:08.720]   and not imprison somebody falsely.
[01:24:08.720 --> 01:24:10.720]   Which means some criminals go free.
[01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:15.360]   But I think a lot of police and prosecutors don't like that idea either.
[01:24:15.360 --> 01:24:19.640]   Well, if you can't actually feel that time into doing your job and you're like, oh man,
[01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:25.400]   you don't, that would be, the flip side of this is, did you follow the Sherry Papini case,
[01:24:25.400 --> 01:24:28.800]   the woman who faked her on kidnapping up in Reading, California?
[01:24:28.800 --> 01:24:29.800]   Yeah.
[01:24:29.800 --> 01:24:32.560]   So this woman back in 2016 disappears and...
[01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:33.560]   It was a hoax.
[01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:35.480]   Yeah, a month later she's like, oh, I was kidding.
[01:24:35.480 --> 01:24:39.080]   She's like, I was kidnapped by Targeted minorities here.
[01:24:39.080 --> 01:24:40.080]   And oh, it was terrible.
[01:24:40.080 --> 01:24:42.880]   They tortured me and they branded me and it turned out that she and her next boyfriend
[01:24:42.880 --> 01:24:44.320]   had cooked up the whole thing.
[01:24:44.320 --> 01:24:45.680]   By the way, she's going to jail now.
[01:24:45.680 --> 01:24:46.680]   Yeah, she is.
[01:24:46.680 --> 01:24:49.040]   She got sentences past week.
[01:24:49.040 --> 01:24:52.400]   The video of her interrogation has hit YouTube.
[01:24:52.400 --> 01:24:55.280]   And I'm not proud of this.
[01:24:55.280 --> 01:25:00.200]   I was doing some really tedious inbox cleaning out and I had it playing in the background
[01:25:00.200 --> 01:25:01.800]   just because I was kind of curious.
[01:25:01.800 --> 01:25:08.080]   But listening to the process of interrogation where she's spitting her tail for the cops
[01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:11.360]   and every time she didn't have an answer to a question, she's like, I just wanted to
[01:25:11.360 --> 01:25:17.720]   go home to my kids and watching them patiently and carefully attack her story from different
[01:25:17.720 --> 01:25:20.000]   angles and ask questions and tell her what they knew.
[01:25:20.000 --> 01:25:21.440]   That's a real skill, isn't it?
[01:25:21.440 --> 01:25:25.160]   And they were non-reactive and they were so calm and so patient and they kept trying
[01:25:25.160 --> 01:25:26.920]   to establish a rapport.
[01:25:26.920 --> 01:25:32.360]   And it hit me the sheer volume of work that goes into developing those skills and being
[01:25:32.360 --> 01:25:36.440]   able to use them is really phenomenal.
[01:25:36.440 --> 01:25:41.440]   What's worrying though is how many people have those experiences where they don't have folks
[01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:44.080]   who have that kind of experience coming in with them.
[01:25:44.080 --> 01:25:47.960]   Like, that I think is where the real risk is, is that we just don't have the people, the
[01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:52.520]   skill and the time that we need to to make sure that we are all presumed innocent.
[01:25:52.520 --> 01:25:57.840]   Yeah, and you have racial bias or you have other biases that impact all elements, whether
[01:25:57.840 --> 01:26:04.440]   it be the prosecutors, the police, who the victim is, who the defendant is, and all of
[01:26:04.440 --> 01:26:10.000]   those things, the care that's taken is dependent on care basically and is dependent on the
[01:26:10.000 --> 01:26:13.640]   time and the support that you have from the people that are over you and whether you're
[01:26:13.640 --> 01:26:15.160]   being pressured.
[01:26:15.160 --> 01:26:19.840]   And frankly, if it's a crime that has a victim by the victim's family because the victim's
[01:26:19.840 --> 01:26:23.200]   family is desperate to solve this crime and find out who's done it.
[01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:29.360]   And so whether the pressure is that there's a quota or system or whether there's a pressure
[01:26:29.360 --> 01:26:34.000]   that there's a mother who really wants to know who took her daughter's life, that's a difficult
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:35.920]   challenge for long-term.
[01:26:35.920 --> 01:26:42.240]   Further made difficult by a true crime podcast about the whole thing, stirring up questions
[01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:44.040]   maybe that don't deserve to be asked.
[01:26:44.040 --> 01:26:49.720]   So yeah, yeah, I know a lot about this because I watch murders in the building on television.
[01:26:49.720 --> 01:26:52.880]   I've learned about Martin Shorts actually.
[01:26:52.880 --> 01:26:54.880]   Oh, he's so educated.
[01:26:54.880 --> 01:26:58.880]   It is such a love letter to a very specific type of New York experience, isn't it?
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:27:03.520]   It's also, I think, all about podcasting and about true crime podcast.
[01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:04.520]   I hate shit.
[01:27:04.520 --> 01:27:08.400]   I have to understand the fact that I just want you to know that.
[01:27:08.400 --> 01:27:10.480]   They all have such great apartments though.
[01:27:10.480 --> 01:27:11.480]   That's what kills me.
[01:27:11.480 --> 01:27:13.200]   I know the aesthetics of that show.
[01:27:13.200 --> 01:27:15.200]   Doesn't everybody in television have great apartments?
[01:27:15.200 --> 01:27:16.200]   Yes.
[01:27:16.200 --> 01:27:17.840]   You've actually got a really terrible apartment.
[01:27:17.840 --> 01:27:25.400]   I have been in Steve Martin's apartment just off Central Park West and it is very nice.
[01:27:25.400 --> 01:27:27.400]   That's a plan.
[01:27:27.400 --> 01:27:28.400]   How was the art?
[01:27:28.400 --> 01:27:29.400]   Oh, the arts great.
[01:27:29.400 --> 01:27:32.720]   I actually asked him to give me a tour and he was happy to do so.
[01:27:32.720 --> 01:27:37.440]   I was going as library, which is a beautiful, you know, exactly as you'd imagine it.
[01:27:37.440 --> 01:27:40.960]   Booklined mahogany library leather couches.
[01:27:40.960 --> 01:27:44.120]   And there's two, not one, but two David Hockney's on the wall.
[01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:45.920]   It's like, okay, fine.
[01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:46.920]   Okay, fine.
[01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:47.920]   We're sitting there.
[01:27:47.920 --> 01:27:48.920]   That's why he's seen Martin.
[01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:49.920]   Is that a Picasso?
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:50.920]   He said, yeah, yeah.
[01:27:50.920 --> 01:27:51.920]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:52.920]   Wow.
[01:27:52.920 --> 01:27:53.920]   Oh, yeah.
[01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:54.920]   Very nice.
[01:27:54.920 --> 01:27:58.280]   And I remember standing looking out at Central Park and he said, yeah.
[01:27:58.280 --> 01:28:02.080]   I actually don't know if I should say this out loud.
[01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:03.080]   Oh, what the hell?
[01:28:03.080 --> 01:28:04.080]   You don't know Steve.
[01:28:04.080 --> 01:28:07.920]   He said, well, we bought this place.
[01:28:07.920 --> 01:28:11.720]   My first wife said, we really got to have a Central Park view and he said, no, we don't
[01:28:11.720 --> 01:28:12.720]   need a Central Park view.
[01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:15.120]   He said, I'm glad we got the Central Park view.
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:16.120]   Yeah.
[01:28:16.120 --> 01:28:18.680]   I remember that the next time I buy an apartment in New York.
[01:28:18.680 --> 01:28:20.320]   Yeah, get the Central Park view.
[01:28:20.320 --> 01:28:21.800]   I know, you live in an Eichler.
[01:28:21.800 --> 01:28:22.800]   You're doing good.
[01:28:22.800 --> 01:28:23.800]   Yeah.
[01:28:23.800 --> 01:28:26.600]   Eichlers have internal courtyards that are.
[01:28:26.600 --> 01:28:30.400]   By the way, my Eichler is 300,000 square feet in case.
[01:28:30.400 --> 01:28:32.240]   300,000 is listening.
[01:28:32.240 --> 01:28:33.720]   Well, is that Donald Trump?
[01:28:33.720 --> 01:28:36.200]   I want to be able to get a billion dollar loan.
[01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:37.200]   Okay.
[01:28:37.200 --> 01:28:38.200]   Yeah.
[01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:39.200]   Don't tell the IRS.
[01:28:39.200 --> 01:28:42.480]   No, it's 300 for the IRS, right?
[01:28:42.480 --> 01:28:44.800]   Get the Central Park view, even if it's an Eichler.
[01:28:44.800 --> 01:28:45.800]   I'm just saying.
[01:28:45.800 --> 01:28:46.800]   I'm just saying.
[01:28:46.800 --> 01:28:48.880]   Just try to imagine the warping of time and space.
[01:28:48.880 --> 01:28:51.200]   You'd have to go into it.
[01:28:51.200 --> 01:28:53.880]   All right, let's take it.
[01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:57.040]   I learned to exaggerate from Laetitia James.
[01:28:57.040 --> 01:28:58.040]   Laetitia James.
[01:28:58.040 --> 01:29:01.600]   You taught me how you're supposed to do this.
[01:29:01.600 --> 01:29:02.760]   Let's take a little break.
[01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:04.040]   I'm having fun with you guys.
[01:29:04.040 --> 01:29:06.200]   We're going to talk more about TV movies.
[01:29:06.200 --> 01:29:11.080]   You do, you, shall you do a TV movie podcast, right?
[01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:13.000]   I do a classic movie podcast.
[01:29:13.000 --> 01:29:14.000]   Oh, even better.
[01:29:14.000 --> 01:29:15.000]   Really?
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:16.000]   Oh, I love classic movies.
[01:29:16.000 --> 01:29:17.000]   Like a TCM podcast.
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:18.000]   Indeed.
[01:29:18.000 --> 01:29:20.200]   It's called Lions, Towers and Shields.
[01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:23.080]   And we talk about, thank you, Leo.
[01:29:23.080 --> 01:29:24.080]   I appreciate it.
[01:29:24.080 --> 01:29:26.320]   We talk about one classic movie each episode.
[01:29:26.320 --> 01:29:27.320]   And I've had the pleasure of having...
[01:29:27.320 --> 01:29:28.320]   Do you put the palette in the...
[01:29:28.320 --> 01:29:31.200]   You put the palette in the pencil and the mortar with the...
[01:29:31.200 --> 01:29:32.200]   Wait a minute, let me get...
[01:29:32.200 --> 01:29:34.120]   We haven't gone to Danny Kay yet.
[01:29:34.120 --> 01:29:35.120]   All right.
[01:29:35.120 --> 01:29:36.120]   We just do a little bit.
[01:29:36.120 --> 01:29:37.120]   I'm going to lose him.
[01:29:37.120 --> 01:29:38.120]   That's what I asked.
[01:29:38.120 --> 01:29:39.800]   We do a lot of noir.
[01:29:39.800 --> 01:29:40.800]   We do a lot of...
[01:29:40.800 --> 01:29:45.680]   And I'm always looking for fun guests, but a lot of incomparable panelists join me.
[01:29:45.680 --> 01:29:49.240]   And what's fun about the incomparable network is it's all these geeky, nerdy people who
[01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:51.800]   know about sci-fi and superheroes.
[01:29:51.800 --> 01:29:55.440]   And I know nothing about superheroes and could just do not.
[01:29:55.440 --> 01:29:59.520]   And so I was amazed and astounded when they not only welcomed me, but when they started
[01:29:59.520 --> 01:30:03.240]   coming on my show and talking about it, classic movies in really intelligent ways.
[01:30:03.240 --> 01:30:04.880]   So it's been a lot of fun.
[01:30:04.880 --> 01:30:05.880]   Lions, Towers and Shields.
[01:30:05.880 --> 01:30:09.080]   And I love the album art because it looks like the old RKO.
[01:30:09.080 --> 01:30:11.120]   I know, isn't it great?
[01:30:11.120 --> 01:30:12.680]   I did a black and white.
[01:30:12.680 --> 01:30:14.200]   I'm a TCM fanboy.
[01:30:14.200 --> 01:30:15.200]   I watch it.
[01:30:15.200 --> 01:30:16.200]   Me too.
[01:30:16.200 --> 01:30:17.200]   All the hot everyday.
[01:30:17.200 --> 01:30:19.200]   Shelley has let me indulge my Barbara O'Neill fixation with...
[01:30:19.200 --> 01:30:20.200]   Oh my God.
[01:30:20.200 --> 01:30:22.200]   The Barbara O'Neill Memorial Highway.
[01:30:22.200 --> 01:30:23.200]   Who's Barbara O'Neill?
[01:30:23.200 --> 01:30:24.200]   I was the best.
[01:30:24.200 --> 01:30:28.280]   She'll play it's by Lita Harris' mother and gone with the win, but she also made a completely
[01:30:28.280 --> 01:30:29.280]   bonker...
[01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:30.640]   Well, she's made two completely bonkers movies.
[01:30:30.640 --> 01:30:31.640]   Yes.
[01:30:31.640 --> 01:30:32.640]   One of which we won forever.
[01:30:32.640 --> 01:30:34.280]   We're not doing the other one.
[01:30:34.280 --> 01:30:37.120]   We're not going to do the toy wife because the toy...
[01:30:37.120 --> 01:30:38.120]   No, we're not doing the toy wife.
[01:30:38.120 --> 01:30:39.120]   Oh, go ahead.
[01:30:39.120 --> 01:30:40.120]   That one's too great.
[01:30:40.120 --> 01:30:41.120]   Wait a minute.
[01:30:41.120 --> 01:30:42.760]   So do you watch the movie while you're doing the podcast?
[01:30:42.760 --> 01:30:44.280]   No, it's not a live commentary.
[01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:48.200]   We have done a live commentary once, but no, we just have everybody watch and then we talk
[01:30:48.200 --> 01:30:49.200]   about it for that on hour.
[01:30:49.200 --> 01:30:51.000]   But go ahead and talk about Barbara O'Neill.
[01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:52.000]   Is she...
[01:30:52.000 --> 01:30:53.000]   What was it?
[01:30:53.000 --> 01:30:54.000]   All of a sudden we'll allow...
[01:30:54.000 --> 01:30:55.160]   All of a sudden, heaven too.
[01:30:55.160 --> 01:30:59.720]   All of a sudden, heaven too, where Betty Davis plays a button down Spinster, wildly casting
[01:30:59.720 --> 01:31:04.480]   its type, who was hired as the nanny for Charles Boye and Barbara O'Neill.
[01:31:04.480 --> 01:31:05.960]   Barbara O'Neill is just unhinged.
[01:31:05.960 --> 01:31:12.480]   She spends the entire movie just turned up to 11 with eyes wide nostrils flaring, skirts
[01:31:12.480 --> 01:31:13.600]   flying everywhere.
[01:31:13.600 --> 01:31:19.360]   She flounces in a high dungeon and she gives these great monologues about how everything
[01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:22.320]   that is mine rightfully so has been stolen from me.
[01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:27.080]   She's got like frames people for murder and there's poison involved.
[01:31:27.080 --> 01:31:32.880]   And the first time we watch this movie, we're like, "Oh, she just keeps going."
[01:31:32.880 --> 01:31:39.240]   Like Betty Davis is just kind of clinging to a corner of the screen wondering what happened.
[01:31:39.240 --> 01:31:40.680]   And so Shelly was kind enough.
[01:31:40.680 --> 01:31:43.880]   Every time I suggest something for Lion's Tower of Shields, I'm like, "Oh, you have
[01:31:43.880 --> 01:31:45.800]   to watch this because it's bonkers."
[01:31:45.800 --> 01:31:47.320]   And Shelly's like, "Fine."
[01:31:47.320 --> 01:31:49.920]   Well, no, the other...
[01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:52.120]   But see, the other side of that coin is a lot of times...
[01:31:52.120 --> 01:31:56.600]   I will suggest a movie that I love and adore or that I think is crazy.
[01:31:56.600 --> 01:32:00.360]   And then I will convince all these nice people who haven't seen it to come and watch it with
[01:32:00.360 --> 01:32:01.360]   me.
[01:32:01.360 --> 01:32:04.160]   And there's always the Shelly, "What have you gotten me into?" phase of the episode.
[01:32:04.160 --> 01:32:07.080]   And I enjoy that so much.
[01:32:07.080 --> 01:32:12.000]   So of the four, Angel Face, all this in Heaven 2, Gone with the Winter, I Am the Law, which
[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:13.320]   movie clip should I play?
[01:32:13.320 --> 01:32:14.320]   All this in Heaven 2?
[01:32:14.320 --> 01:32:15.320]   All this in Heaven 2.
[01:32:15.320 --> 01:32:16.320]   All this in Heaven 2.
[01:32:16.320 --> 01:32:17.320]   Yeah.
[01:32:17.320 --> 01:32:18.320]   Charles Boye, man.
[01:32:18.320 --> 01:32:19.320]   Yeah.
[01:32:19.320 --> 01:32:20.320]   Yeah.
[01:32:20.320 --> 01:32:21.320]   Early in her long narrative flashback.
[01:32:21.320 --> 01:32:22.320]   Oh, copyright.
[01:32:22.320 --> 01:32:23.320]   Shmoppy, right.
[01:32:23.320 --> 01:32:26.320]   It's golden after they'll copy her.
[01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:27.320]   It's 1940.
[01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:28.320]   Is that...
[01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:29.320]   Yeah.
[01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:30.320]   I don't know.
[01:32:30.320 --> 01:32:32.320]   I'm going to have to send you her not out of copyright now.
[01:32:32.320 --> 01:32:35.320]   And Warner Brothers still is, you know, holding it.
[01:32:35.320 --> 01:32:36.320]   They insist.
[01:32:36.320 --> 01:32:37.320]   Yeah, they figured it out.
[01:32:37.320 --> 01:32:38.320]   All right.
[01:32:38.320 --> 01:32:39.320]   Never mind.
[01:32:39.320 --> 01:32:40.320]   I do want to hear it.
[01:32:40.320 --> 01:32:41.320]   I do want to hear it.
[01:32:41.320 --> 01:32:42.320]   We've talked about...
[01:32:42.320 --> 01:32:43.320]   You want to hear it.
[01:32:43.320 --> 01:32:44.320]   Do you want to get me in trouble now?
[01:32:44.320 --> 01:32:45.320]   That's right.
[01:32:45.320 --> 01:32:47.320]   It's a nice, sneaky way to take over your show.
[01:32:47.320 --> 01:32:48.720]   All this in Heaven 2.
[01:32:48.720 --> 01:32:49.720]   All right.
[01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:50.720]   It's not playing.
[01:32:50.720 --> 01:32:56.520]   Maybe it's trying to protect me from my worst inclination.
[01:32:56.520 --> 01:32:57.520]   Maybe it's...
[01:32:57.520 --> 01:32:58.520]   Maybe it's because I'm using Firefox.
[01:32:58.520 --> 01:32:59.520]   Oh, no.
[01:32:59.520 --> 01:33:00.520]   Here we go.
[01:33:00.520 --> 01:33:01.520]   Here we go.
[01:33:01.520 --> 01:33:03.840]   There's the beautiful Charles Boye.
[01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:04.840]   It's just sitting there.
[01:33:04.840 --> 01:33:05.840]   There we go.
[01:33:05.840 --> 01:33:06.840]   Spinning.
[01:33:06.840 --> 01:33:07.840]   There's go.
[01:33:07.840 --> 01:33:09.840]   Oh, there's Betty Davis.
[01:33:09.840 --> 01:33:10.840]   Yes.
[01:33:10.840 --> 01:33:15.280]   I don't know just this.
[01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:16.280]   What year was this?
[01:33:16.280 --> 01:33:17.280]   1940.
[01:33:17.280 --> 01:33:18.280]   1940.
[01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:19.280]   Oh, great.
[01:33:19.280 --> 01:33:20.280]   Yup.
[01:33:20.280 --> 01:33:21.280]   era.
[01:33:21.280 --> 01:33:24.560]   It was before 11, but if I had been convening, see you.
[01:33:24.560 --> 01:33:25.560]   These things are...
[01:33:25.560 --> 01:33:26.560]   This is so against type for Betty Davis.
[01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:27.560]   Right.
[01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:28.560]   Right.
[01:33:28.560 --> 01:33:29.560]   Yes.
[01:33:29.560 --> 01:33:30.560]   That's why I wanted to do it.
[01:33:30.560 --> 01:33:31.560]   She's a mouse.
[01:33:31.560 --> 01:33:34.720]   And then when I discovered Lisa's enjoyment of Barbara O'Neill, I was like, "All right,
[01:33:34.720 --> 01:33:35.720]   we have to do that."
[01:33:35.720 --> 01:33:37.880]   Does Betty Davis end up being a poisoner?
[01:33:37.880 --> 01:33:38.880]   No.
[01:33:38.880 --> 01:33:39.880]   Oh, she should.
[01:33:39.880 --> 01:33:43.120]   No, she ends up being the poor put upon little...
[01:33:43.120 --> 01:33:44.120]   Oh, sad.
[01:33:44.120 --> 01:33:45.120]   Right.
[01:33:45.120 --> 01:33:46.120]   Little...
[01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:47.120]   She's very mousy throughout.
[01:33:47.120 --> 01:33:48.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:33:48.120 --> 01:33:49.120]   The moving...
[01:33:49.120 --> 01:33:52.640]   The framing device is ridiculous in this movie, which is another reason I love it so.
[01:33:52.640 --> 01:33:57.160]   But Barbara O'Neill, like what you heard through the door, like that is pretty much the note
[01:33:57.160 --> 01:33:59.160]   that she has repeated like this.
[01:33:59.160 --> 01:34:00.160]   That's right.
[01:34:00.160 --> 01:34:04.200]   And do you tell people where they can stream these shows so you don't just get your counter
[01:34:04.200 --> 01:34:05.200]   classic movies or your playing...
[01:34:05.200 --> 01:34:06.200]   They're all on key TV.
[01:34:06.200 --> 01:34:07.560]   Well, sometimes yes, and sometimes no.
[01:34:07.560 --> 01:34:11.760]   I always give a streaming link as well as a media link every once in a while because I
[01:34:11.760 --> 01:34:13.960]   actually have a rather large Plex library.
[01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:17.880]   Every once in a while, I will put something up that isn't streamable and so I have to
[01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:19.880]   help my panelists out a little bit.
[01:34:19.880 --> 01:34:24.200]   If we're finding where they can stream it, but I always have justwatch.com link to where
[01:34:24.200 --> 01:34:27.200]   you can stream it or whether you can get the physical media.
[01:34:27.200 --> 01:34:30.400]   I hate it when I get all excited about something and I can't stream it.
[01:34:30.400 --> 01:34:31.400]   Oh, yeah.
[01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:36.440]   Same here, which is why I collected physical media over the years and the steps to do because
[01:34:36.440 --> 01:34:39.600]   especially for classic movies, it's very...
[01:34:39.600 --> 01:34:40.600]   It's not predictable.
[01:34:40.600 --> 01:34:41.600]   It's very inconsistent.
[01:34:41.600 --> 01:34:43.320]   You say, "Oh, well, certain studio made it."
[01:34:43.320 --> 01:34:46.560]   Well, that doesn't mean that the legal rights were cleared, nor does it mean that the studio
[01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:48.480]   that made it continues to own it.
[01:34:48.480 --> 01:34:51.760]   It's all very complicated, especially for paramount movies, although it's much better
[01:34:51.760 --> 01:34:53.200]   than it used to be.
[01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:55.280]   And I don't even pretend to understand all of it.
[01:34:55.280 --> 01:34:59.600]   I just have to look them up on an individual basis and go, "Oh, that one isn't streaming.
[01:34:59.600 --> 01:35:01.920]   Maybe we won't do it or it is streaming.
[01:35:01.920 --> 01:35:02.920]   Let's do it now."
[01:35:02.920 --> 01:35:09.400]   I subscribe to the Criterion channel, which has a lot of great old movies and obscure
[01:35:09.400 --> 01:35:10.880]   movies and things on it.
[01:35:10.880 --> 01:35:13.120]   Well, and they do great Blu-ray releases.
[01:35:13.120 --> 01:35:14.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:15.120]   The Criterion releases have...
[01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:18.920]   I used to buy their laser discs, and that's why I got the trailer.
[01:35:18.920 --> 01:35:22.520]   And so you can actually see their effort in the stream as well.
[01:35:22.520 --> 01:35:24.800]   So that's kind of nice.
[01:35:24.800 --> 01:35:25.800]   Let's take a little break.
[01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:26.800]   I don't know how we got on that.
[01:35:26.800 --> 01:35:30.680]   We're testing Content ID today on a Twitch.
[01:35:30.680 --> 01:35:31.800]   We'll see what happens.
[01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:35.680]   See if Warner Brothers is worried about 1940s movies.
[01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:38.920]   Our show today brought to you by Zip Recruiter.
[01:35:38.920 --> 01:35:40.040]   We use Zip Recruiter.
[01:35:40.040 --> 01:35:41.720]   We've hired so many people.
[01:35:41.720 --> 01:35:44.880]   Frankly, there's only two ways you can get hired at Twitch, either.
[01:35:44.880 --> 01:35:47.120]   We know somebody who knows you.
[01:35:47.120 --> 01:35:48.640]   That's I think how we hired Benito, right?
[01:35:48.640 --> 01:35:50.240]   Or do we use Zip Recruiter for you, Benito?
[01:35:50.240 --> 01:35:51.760]   I can't remember.
[01:35:51.760 --> 01:35:52.760]   You know Jason.
[01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:53.760]   That's right.
[01:35:53.760 --> 01:35:57.120]   John moved next door about 15 years.
[01:35:57.120 --> 01:35:58.320]   You're 15th anniversary.
[01:35:58.320 --> 01:36:00.080]   Happy anniversary, John.
[01:36:00.080 --> 01:36:01.680]   15 years ago, he just moved next door.
[01:36:01.680 --> 01:36:03.880]   He said, "They're going to give me a job if I just moved next door."
[01:36:03.880 --> 01:36:06.040]   And it worked.
[01:36:06.040 --> 01:36:11.040]   On the other hand, we just lost our dear beloved continuity person.
[01:36:11.040 --> 01:36:13.080]   It took another job.
[01:36:13.080 --> 01:36:14.720]   Sometimes that happens.
[01:36:14.720 --> 01:36:21.120]   But that's a big loss because that person does a lot of work with copy, working with the editors
[01:36:21.120 --> 01:36:24.640]   to make sure the ads get done right, working with the clients to make sure they're getting
[01:36:24.640 --> 01:36:26.600]   their needs met.
[01:36:26.600 --> 01:36:27.880]   We were down a person.
[01:36:27.880 --> 01:36:28.880]   We go to Zip Recruiter.
[01:36:28.880 --> 01:36:29.880]   Look who we've got.
[01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:31.840]   Viva, who's wonderful.
[01:36:31.840 --> 01:36:38.200]   Zip Recruiter, Lisa goes there every single time because it's just the easiest way to hire.
[01:36:38.200 --> 01:36:42.720]   It's also really effective.
[01:36:42.720 --> 01:36:43.720]   We have a lot.
[01:36:43.720 --> 01:36:46.760]   We didn't know it to watch this show, but we've got engineers.
[01:36:46.760 --> 01:36:47.760]   We've got editors.
[01:36:47.760 --> 01:36:48.760]   We've got producers.
[01:36:48.760 --> 01:36:49.760]   We've got a continuity apartment.
[01:36:49.760 --> 01:36:51.760]   We've got salespeople.
[01:36:51.760 --> 01:36:57.440]   And in every case, Zip Recruiter has brought us those talented people.
[01:36:57.440 --> 01:37:02.600]   It's critical for us as business owners to get the right people in the right job, right?
[01:37:02.600 --> 01:37:06.840]   So whether you're hiring for a podcast or your own growing business, Zip Recruiter is
[01:37:06.840 --> 01:37:08.560]   the place to go.
[01:37:08.560 --> 01:37:09.560]   For a couple of reasons.
[01:37:09.560 --> 01:37:13.800]   Post on Zip Recruiter, it goes to 100 plus job sites plus social networks.
[01:37:13.800 --> 01:37:16.360]   So you're posting to everywhere, right?
[01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:18.600]   More people will see it.
[01:37:18.600 --> 01:37:21.600]   And the more people will see it, the more likely that right person that need a little
[01:37:21.600 --> 01:37:23.760]   on haystack will see it.
[01:37:23.760 --> 01:37:26.000]   But how do you find that needle in a haystack?
[01:37:26.000 --> 01:37:30.760]   That's where Zip Recruiter really, their technology really, really shines.
[01:37:30.760 --> 01:37:34.280]   All of the interest comes into your Zip Recruiter interface.
[01:37:34.280 --> 01:37:37.080]   So they reformat the resume so you can scan through them easily.
[01:37:37.080 --> 01:37:41.440]   They allow you to add screening questions so that you can eliminate people who just,
[01:37:41.440 --> 01:37:43.680]   you know, don't fit your needs.
[01:37:43.680 --> 01:37:48.800]   They also take all the phone calls you would get, all the inbox email you would get, put
[01:37:48.800 --> 01:37:52.040]   that into the interface so you don't get bombarded.
[01:37:52.040 --> 01:37:56.200]   You just go when you have some time and look at the Zip Recruiter interface.
[01:37:56.200 --> 01:38:00.480]   But then Zip Recruiter does something that's so cool because they already have a million
[01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:01.640]   resumes on file.
[01:38:01.640 --> 01:38:03.520]   People come to Zip Recruiter looking for work.
[01:38:03.520 --> 01:38:08.360]   They go through those resumes and match them to your job.
[01:38:08.360 --> 01:38:12.240]   So they find the right candidates, people with the qualifications you need and then
[01:38:12.240 --> 01:38:17.480]   send you their names and you can invite them to apply, whoever, whichever ones that you
[01:38:17.480 --> 01:38:18.480]   like.
[01:38:18.480 --> 01:38:22.760]   Now, the reason that's so successful is when you get in, imagine you're applying for a
[01:38:22.760 --> 01:38:26.760]   job and a company comes to you as we'd like to hire you.
[01:38:26.760 --> 01:38:29.880]   You're much more likely to follow through on the process.
[01:38:29.880 --> 01:38:33.200]   It's just a, it's a great way to start a relationship.
[01:38:33.200 --> 01:38:37.000]   Remember how to five employers who post on Zip Recruiter will get a quality candidate
[01:38:37.000 --> 01:38:38.360]   within the first day.
[01:38:38.360 --> 01:38:42.560]   I would say for us, it's within hours every single time.
[01:38:42.560 --> 01:38:47.920]   And when you're down a person, every hour counts, you want to get that job filled.
[01:38:47.920 --> 01:38:52.480]   Look, if you love our shows, you love the people who make our shows, you're going to
[01:38:52.480 --> 01:38:54.200]   want to try Zip Recruiter for free today.
[01:38:54.200 --> 01:38:59.920]   You need to remember our special URL, those ziprecruiter.com/twit@ziprecruiter.com/twit@ziprecruiter.com/twit.
[01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:08.520]   You know, my wife Lisa says that every time Zip Recruiter, the smartest way to hire,
[01:39:08.520 --> 01:39:10.120]   it's where we get our best employees.
[01:39:10.120 --> 01:39:11.880]   We're very happy to have you all.
[01:39:11.880 --> 01:39:14.880]   ZipRecruiter.com/twit.
[01:39:14.880 --> 01:39:19.720]   All right, moving right along.
[01:39:19.720 --> 01:39:23.080]   Do not make chicken with NyQuil.
[01:39:23.080 --> 01:39:29.320]   Very important.
[01:39:29.320 --> 01:39:31.040]   It's such an expensive ingredient.
[01:39:31.040 --> 01:39:33.680]   Why would you waste it bracing a chicken breast in it?
[01:39:33.680 --> 01:39:38.640]   It turns out nobody was till the FDA put out a press release.
[01:39:38.640 --> 01:39:39.640]   Oh my gosh.
[01:39:39.640 --> 01:39:41.880]   Oh, those poor old-fashioned people.
[01:39:41.880 --> 01:39:46.960]   NyQuil chicken, the notion of cooking chicken and NyQuil, which needless to say is a very
[01:39:46.960 --> 01:39:48.680]   bad idea, right?
[01:39:48.680 --> 01:39:49.680]   Yes.
[01:39:49.680 --> 01:39:50.680]   Right?
[01:39:50.680 --> 01:39:51.680]   We all agree.
[01:39:51.680 --> 01:39:53.680]   And it's poison.
[01:39:53.680 --> 01:39:57.200]   Maybe if you're Barbara Stanwick or Betty Davis.
[01:39:57.200 --> 01:40:03.000]   If you're a grown-up, you end up having a little less.
[01:40:03.000 --> 01:40:05.600]   Yeah, but John's boy is dying of NyQuil poisoning.
[01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:06.600]   NyQuil poisoning.
[01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:07.600]   That's not it.
[01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:08.600]   That's why I was in this chicken.
[01:40:08.600 --> 01:40:09.600]   Some reason.
[01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:12.800]   Why is it by its green?
[01:40:12.800 --> 01:40:15.400]   Some reason.
[01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:19.560]   So it was put as like a joke on 4chan.
[01:40:19.560 --> 01:40:20.560]   Five years ago.
[01:40:20.560 --> 01:40:21.560]   Oh my God.
[01:40:21.560 --> 01:40:22.560]   Wow.
[01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:25.200]   And then apparently some people made TikToks about it.
[01:40:25.200 --> 01:40:31.000]   But for some reason last week, we mentioned this on Twig, the FDA released a press release
[01:40:31.000 --> 01:40:34.720]   saying it's titled "A Recipe for Danger."
[01:40:34.720 --> 01:40:36.240]   Oh, oh my God.
[01:40:36.240 --> 01:40:37.240]   Social media.
[01:40:37.240 --> 01:40:38.240]   I don't watch that movie.
[01:40:38.240 --> 01:40:39.240]   "A Recipe for a Danger."
[01:40:39.240 --> 01:40:41.280]   You know what that would be a good one.
[01:40:41.280 --> 01:40:43.280]   You know, you say that and she and Andrews are like, "Yes."
[01:40:43.280 --> 01:40:44.280]   Yeah, it was.
[01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:45.280]   Well, that's the problem.
[01:40:45.280 --> 01:40:46.760]   Yes, let's find out.
[01:40:46.760 --> 01:40:47.760]   That's the problem.
[01:40:47.760 --> 01:40:48.760]   Oh my gosh.
[01:40:48.760 --> 01:40:50.240]   The FDA referred to it as a recent trend.
[01:40:50.240 --> 01:40:55.040]   They cite no recent examples according to Angadget.
[01:40:55.040 --> 01:40:56.280]   There were.
[01:40:56.280 --> 01:41:00.160]   So this press release went out on September 15th.
[01:41:00.160 --> 01:41:05.480]   On September 14th, the day before the notice, there were five searches for NyQuil chicken
[01:41:05.480 --> 01:41:06.720]   in the app.
[01:41:06.720 --> 01:41:16.960]   The day after the release, there were 7,000 literally an increase of 1,400 times.
[01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:18.880]   We know this is the stress and effect.
[01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:22.400]   This is hilarious until you realize that what's going to happen is you are going to have a
[01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:27.040]   genuine public health hazard and the FDA may want to say something.
[01:41:27.040 --> 01:41:30.480]   Never one will be like, "Is this NyQuil chicken all over again?"
[01:41:30.480 --> 01:41:32.080]   It's your FDA.
[01:41:32.080 --> 01:41:33.960]   Please get a subscription to Know Your Meme.
[01:41:33.960 --> 01:41:34.960]   There you go.
[01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:35.960]   Well, yeah.
[01:41:35.960 --> 01:41:36.960]   There you go.
[01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:37.960]   Well, this is a consistent problem.
[01:41:37.960 --> 01:41:42.160]   I can't make fun of them out of context, but there are ways you could suss it out and
[01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:45.240]   figure out whether in fact this is a real thing or not.
[01:41:45.240 --> 01:41:48.400]   Know Your Meme is certainly one of the places that you're not wrong.
[01:41:48.400 --> 01:41:49.480]   It's a bad idea.
[01:41:49.480 --> 01:41:58.440]   Does this point to a wider disconnect between the information ecosystem on different social
[01:41:58.440 --> 01:42:05.600]   media apps compared to how folks in the government are able to keep on top of that information
[01:42:05.600 --> 01:42:06.760]   and put it into context?
[01:42:06.760 --> 01:42:07.760]   Yes, that plus.
[01:42:07.760 --> 01:42:09.880]   Because we're all extremely online.
[01:42:09.880 --> 01:42:13.360]   So we're all like, "Oh my God, the minute you see something on TikTok, like final legitimate
[01:42:13.360 --> 01:42:14.360]   source."
[01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:18.280]   But what if you've got somebody who has only heard about the TikTok from a friend of a
[01:42:18.280 --> 01:42:23.120]   friend and they are genuinely concerned about someone comes and goes, "Did you hear teenagers
[01:42:23.120 --> 01:42:25.280]   on the TikTok or cooking things in costs here?"
[01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:26.920]   Right, because remember TidePods.
[01:42:26.920 --> 01:42:31.360]   And that happened and there was criticism for why didn't anybody do anything about this.
[01:42:31.360 --> 01:42:35.680]   And so somebody at the FDA thought, "We need to get on top of this."
[01:42:35.680 --> 01:42:40.160]   Somebody else at the FDA thought, "Oh my God, look at all the clicks my press releases."
[01:42:40.160 --> 01:42:44.600]   And then you add in misinformation and distrust of government.
[01:42:44.600 --> 01:42:48.760]   And I'm sure somebody is going to tell us that "Nykel Chicken will cure COVID and they
[01:42:48.760 --> 01:42:49.760]   don't want to throw it out."
[01:42:49.760 --> 01:42:50.760]   Oh God, yeah, inject "Nykel."
[01:42:50.760 --> 01:42:53.760]   You're going to end up being like cited.
[01:42:53.760 --> 01:42:57.960]   Your whole face there just got turned into a screen grab for some Facebook group that
[01:42:57.960 --> 01:43:00.760]   says, "Gernerius says the "Nykel Chicken" here's COVID."
[01:43:00.760 --> 01:43:01.760]   Oh, I'm famous.
[01:43:01.760 --> 01:43:02.760]   I'll be famous.
[01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:05.160]   Yeah, you can't fault the NDAs intent.
[01:43:05.160 --> 01:43:06.160]   The algorithm is spoken.
[01:43:06.160 --> 01:43:08.360]   It is a recipe for danger.
[01:43:08.360 --> 01:43:09.360]   Oh, absolutely.
[01:43:09.360 --> 01:43:16.640]   But there is also a risk that by publicizing it, now the good news is no one has died of
[01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:20.360]   Nykel Chicken as we go to press.
[01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:21.360]   Apparently the FDA-
[01:43:21.360 --> 01:43:24.800]   Don't you sleep better though?
[01:43:24.800 --> 01:43:25.800]   Larry?
[01:43:25.800 --> 01:43:28.160]   Oh, you're curious.
[01:43:28.160 --> 01:43:30.160]   Larry, no.
[01:43:30.160 --> 01:43:34.880]   The FDA has, if you didn't want that, you could use day quill though.
[01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:38.640]   The FDA has only posted once before about a viral channel challenge and that was the
[01:43:38.640 --> 01:43:42.080]   deadly Benadryl challenge of 2020.
[01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:43.800]   I don't know what that is and I'm not sure.
[01:43:43.800 --> 01:43:44.800]   I want a study of that.
[01:43:44.800 --> 01:43:45.800]   Larry sounds like he knows.
[01:43:45.800 --> 01:43:46.800]   I wish he popularized it.
[01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:47.800]   Well, I know that.
[01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:49.760]   I know that there are somebody who tends to cook things.
[01:43:49.760 --> 01:43:51.640]   I'm going to go ahead and do more and more.
[01:43:51.640 --> 01:43:52.640]   Do not cook the Benadryl, no.
[01:43:52.640 --> 01:43:55.360]   Yeah, there are more and more over-the-counter drugs when you go to the drug store that are
[01:43:55.360 --> 01:43:57.640]   actually behind a lock case.
[01:43:57.640 --> 01:43:58.640]   Right.
[01:43:58.640 --> 01:44:02.480]   Because people are buying these things for all sorts of inappropriate reasons.
[01:44:02.480 --> 01:44:03.480]   Yeah.
[01:44:03.480 --> 01:44:05.240]   So I do not recommend that you cook with Nykel.
[01:44:05.240 --> 01:44:06.840]   I just want to be very clear about that.
[01:44:06.840 --> 01:44:07.840]   Oh, yeah.
[01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:10.920]   You know, we can cut that part out so we don't have to worry about that.
[01:44:10.920 --> 01:44:14.720]   Every time I have to sign the form in California, you have to sign a form if you're buying a
[01:44:14.720 --> 01:44:18.240]   bottle of the good suit of that, the stuff that actually works.
[01:44:18.240 --> 01:44:19.320]   Because people make meth out of it.
[01:44:19.320 --> 01:44:21.320]   Yeah, and every time we do it, I always have to like-
[01:44:21.320 --> 01:44:22.320]   I know that from Breaking Bad.
[01:44:22.320 --> 01:44:26.560]   I have to bite the urge to talk about how I'm making small batch artisanal meth.
[01:44:26.560 --> 01:44:32.720]   Like, see, I have to keep that with how I'm cooking properties of Nykel and I'm not going
[01:44:32.720 --> 01:44:35.480]   to say of them because they're funny, but I'm not doing it.
[01:44:35.480 --> 01:44:38.320]   No, no, like the devil of my shoulders go ahead and make the joke.
[01:44:38.320 --> 01:44:39.320]   It's the Bay Area.
[01:44:39.320 --> 01:44:40.320]   But-
[01:44:40.320 --> 01:44:42.960]   Our tisest little yim and yim and yim on meth syndrome.
[01:44:42.960 --> 01:44:46.880]   Well, also, you're not on a podcast at that point, so you know, it's fine.
[01:44:46.880 --> 01:44:49.560]   So you all watch a lot of TV.
[01:44:49.560 --> 01:44:53.480]   Do you think Breaking Bad actually gave you a recipe for making really high quality meth
[01:44:53.480 --> 01:44:55.760]   or was that just made up?
[01:44:55.760 --> 01:44:56.760]   I don't know.
[01:44:56.760 --> 01:44:57.760]   I just asked you-
[01:44:57.760 --> 01:44:59.760]   I wasn't watching it for that for a minute.
[01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:01.760]   I didn't actually watch Breaking Bad, so I-
[01:45:01.760 --> 01:45:02.760]   Oh!
[01:45:02.760 --> 01:45:03.760]   Oh!
[01:45:03.760 --> 01:45:05.520]   What are the great shows of all time?
[01:45:05.520 --> 01:45:08.040]   There's only so many anti-hero shows that you can watch.
[01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:09.040]   Right?
[01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:10.040]   I mean, I watched Mad Men.
[01:45:10.040 --> 01:45:11.040]   Come on, I did that.
[01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:12.040]   Oh, I love Mad Men.
[01:45:12.040 --> 01:45:13.040]   Oh, yeah.
[01:45:13.040 --> 01:45:14.040]   I actually-
[01:45:14.040 --> 01:45:15.040]   This is a recommendation.
[01:45:15.040 --> 01:45:16.040]   We watched Fletch last night, the new Fletch movie with Tom.
[01:45:16.040 --> 01:45:17.040]   Is it good?
[01:45:17.040 --> 01:45:18.960]   It is such a fun way to spend your time.
[01:45:18.960 --> 01:45:24.160]   So he's kind of shaking the Chevy chase stigma against Fletch?
[01:45:24.160 --> 01:45:25.800]   Yeah, he's made it his own.
[01:45:25.800 --> 01:45:30.920]   And my husband loves the books, loves, loves, loves the books, and gave it his stamp of
[01:45:30.920 --> 01:45:34.680]   approval, and Ham's casting is really perfect, and they had a really solid supporting cast.
[01:45:34.680 --> 01:45:37.560]   John Ham, who was in Mad Men, is now playing.
[01:45:37.560 --> 01:45:38.560]   John Slattery.
[01:45:38.560 --> 01:45:39.560]   John Slattery.
[01:45:39.560 --> 01:45:40.560]   Slattery's in it too, yeah.
[01:45:40.560 --> 01:45:43.560]   As his pissy pissy editor, and it's just a delight.
[01:45:43.560 --> 01:45:46.080]   I love that Ham and Slattery are in stuff together.
[01:45:46.080 --> 01:45:47.080]   It's so terrible.
[01:45:47.080 --> 01:45:48.080]   They always are.
[01:45:48.080 --> 01:45:50.240]   It's like my favorite breakfast, Ham and Slattery.
[01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:51.240]   Ham and Slattery.
[01:45:51.240 --> 01:45:54.320]   Sounds right English, like you might have it if you went to London.
[01:45:54.320 --> 01:45:55.320]   Can I do it?
[01:45:55.320 --> 01:45:58.760]   You have tomatoes and beans with that Ham and Slattery.
[01:45:58.760 --> 01:46:05.920]   Geddy Images has banned the use of AI generated content over fields of legal challenge.
[01:46:05.920 --> 01:46:13.360]   Now this has really been, I think, a fascinating, I called it a Cambrian explosion of AI with,
[01:46:13.360 --> 01:46:18.220]   of course, it started with Dolly too, and then a stable diffusion broke it open because
[01:46:18.220 --> 01:46:21.640]   you could download it, run it on your own computer.
[01:46:21.640 --> 01:46:22.720]   There are others.
[01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:25.080]   They make amazing images.
[01:46:25.080 --> 01:46:32.120]   But Geddy, quite reasonably is a little upset because all of these AI generators train on
[01:46:32.120 --> 01:46:34.680]   publicly available image sets.
[01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:35.680]   And apparently-
[01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:36.680]   Who owns those images?
[01:46:36.680 --> 01:46:41.720]   It's not unusual, according to Emmy, that you will find, or Geddy rather, that you will
[01:46:41.720 --> 01:46:47.880]   find the Geddy Images watermark in images created by these AI art generators because
[01:46:47.880 --> 01:46:52.040]   so many of them have been trained on Geddy Images.
[01:46:52.040 --> 01:46:53.040]   Oh.
[01:46:53.040 --> 01:46:54.040]   Watermark.
[01:46:54.040 --> 01:46:58.120]   That looks much better in that picture than he does in any other photograph I've ever seen.
[01:46:58.120 --> 01:47:01.760]   You know, when he shared that story with us, I thought about the end of William Gibson's
[01:47:01.760 --> 01:47:09.040]   novel, Count Zero, where a curator is tasked by a billionaire to find the elusive artist
[01:47:09.040 --> 01:47:14.160]   who has been doing remixed collages and mixed media.
[01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:17.720]   And she discovers, well, the novel is like 40 years old, we can play.
[01:47:17.720 --> 01:47:21.440]   She discovers it's an AI that's creating the art.
[01:47:21.440 --> 01:47:26.400]   And I find it really interesting that we're now getting to the point where we're basically
[01:47:26.400 --> 01:47:31.400]   taking the suite of technologies that we call AI and pointing it at a data set known as
[01:47:31.400 --> 01:47:35.560]   images and saying here, mix and match and find a way to recombine them in exciting new
[01:47:35.560 --> 01:47:38.960]   ways and we'll find a way to use that what you come up with.
[01:47:38.960 --> 01:47:39.960]   Who's the artist?
[01:47:39.960 --> 01:47:42.400]   Is his name Rokowski?
[01:47:42.400 --> 01:47:45.360]   Who does Greg Rokowski?
[01:47:45.360 --> 01:47:46.760]   Does these beautiful-
[01:47:46.760 --> 01:47:50.760]   You see him on the covers of science fiction works and so forth.
[01:47:50.760 --> 01:47:52.240]   Yeah, that does look real science fiction-
[01:47:52.240 --> 01:48:01.360]   He is upset because he is often used, you know how these work is you give them a text
[01:48:01.360 --> 01:48:05.640]   phrase to describe it and then they draw it.
[01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:11.280]   His name appears very commonly in a lot of these illustrations because they're looking
[01:48:11.280 --> 01:48:13.280]   to get it in that style.
[01:48:13.280 --> 01:48:15.080]   He's Polish.
[01:48:15.080 --> 01:48:19.000]   He's created fantasy scenes for Dungeons and Dragons and Magic.
[01:48:19.000 --> 01:48:20.720]   He's got a really distinctive style.
[01:48:20.720 --> 01:48:25.720]   He's very beautiful, I think, light and so forth.
[01:48:25.720 --> 01:48:31.160]   He's kind of like a concade, the master of light who is another name who appears a lot
[01:48:31.160 --> 01:48:35.640]   apparently in the descriptions.
[01:48:35.640 --> 01:48:40.400]   Stable diffusion, which is the one that's open source and you can install yourself, is
[01:48:40.400 --> 01:48:46.640]   trained on five billion image text pairings.
[01:48:46.640 --> 01:48:52.560]   So Andy Bia, we talked about this when he did it a few weeks ago, analyzed 12 million
[01:48:52.560 --> 01:48:58.480]   of the five billion and found many come from sites like Pinterest and Fine Art America.
[01:48:58.480 --> 01:49:03.360]   And there is some suspicion that Rokowski's work was actually scraped from his portfolio
[01:49:03.360 --> 01:49:05.240]   on art station.
[01:49:05.240 --> 01:49:07.520]   And so he's a little upset.
[01:49:07.520 --> 01:49:08.520]   He's a little upset.
[01:49:08.520 --> 01:49:12.960]   He says, "A.I. should exclude living artists from its database and instead focus on works
[01:49:12.960 --> 01:49:15.440]   under the public domain."
[01:49:15.440 --> 01:49:20.160]   There's a huge financial issue in evolving AI from being non-profit research to a commercial
[01:49:20.160 --> 01:49:24.960]   product project without asking artists from their mission.
[01:49:24.960 --> 01:49:29.280]   I think a lot about this because my former job at Texas Standard was to run the website
[01:49:29.280 --> 01:49:31.720]   and so a lot of times I was looking for images.
[01:49:31.720 --> 01:49:37.200]   And we had paid sources of images but we would a lot of times go to Wikipedia or to
[01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:41.040]   Flickr with CC rights stuff.
[01:49:41.040 --> 01:49:44.800]   All sorts of different ways to get images and we had to be very careful.
[01:49:44.800 --> 01:49:49.040]   And in fact, we've gotten a few takedowns because something was labeled incorrectly.
[01:49:49.040 --> 01:49:52.560]   And so when I saw that and we don't have a Getty subscription because it's kind of pricey,
[01:49:52.560 --> 01:49:55.080]   a lot of journalistic entities do.
[01:49:55.080 --> 01:49:59.840]   Your AP and NPR and various most newspapers typically have Getty.
[01:49:59.840 --> 01:50:06.520]   And so I feel like it's kind of a protection for the lowly website person who just really
[01:50:06.520 --> 01:50:12.040]   needs a picture of the president or of the border fence or of the latest terrible incident
[01:50:12.040 --> 01:50:16.400]   that happened that we need a photograph of and doesn't necessarily know the provenance
[01:50:16.400 --> 01:50:17.400]   of it.
[01:50:17.400 --> 01:50:21.720]   It's hard enough when theoretically there are credit lines and you know the source of
[01:50:21.720 --> 01:50:25.880]   a piece of art or piece of imagery whether it's a photograph or whether it's an art.
[01:50:25.880 --> 01:50:26.880]   But piece of art.
[01:50:26.880 --> 01:50:31.760]   But then you go and you add the AI element and there are, as I know because I've read
[01:50:31.760 --> 01:50:39.000]   an awful lot of Flickr creative commons listings, a lot of images they say you have permission
[01:50:39.000 --> 01:50:43.840]   to remix it with credit or you don't have permission to remix it at all or you can
[01:50:43.840 --> 01:50:45.920]   remix it up to this point.
[01:50:45.920 --> 01:50:51.040]   And all of that assumes art or photographs that were created by actual humans.
[01:50:51.040 --> 01:50:56.360]   But you get AI in the mix and it's really hard for somebody to know if they're being
[01:50:56.360 --> 01:50:57.360]   honest.
[01:50:57.360 --> 01:51:00.800]   They're trying to only use things that you have permission to use and to give full credit
[01:51:00.800 --> 01:51:01.800]   where it's due.
[01:51:01.800 --> 01:51:07.000]   But you don't necessarily have any sort of realistic expectation that you are being accurate
[01:51:07.000 --> 01:51:08.000]   when you give that credit.
[01:51:08.000 --> 01:51:12.160]   I kind of think of it more as kind of a fair use.
[01:51:12.160 --> 01:51:17.440]   You're dwindling our chat room says as an artist I've studied the work of other artists.
[01:51:17.440 --> 01:51:19.720]   That's how I learned how to do things.
[01:51:19.720 --> 01:51:21.280]   Why shouldn't AI be willing to do it?
[01:51:21.280 --> 01:51:25.440]   It's not an exact duplicate of the work of art.
[01:51:25.440 --> 01:51:27.360]   It's influenced by or it's styled like.
[01:51:27.360 --> 01:51:29.160]   I think that should be fine.
[01:51:29.160 --> 01:51:32.600]   So Harvard University has something called the Studio Habits of Mind where they've broken
[01:51:32.600 --> 01:51:34.640]   down how artists work.
[01:51:34.640 --> 01:51:40.800]   And one of the eight studio habits of mind you have and one of them is to actually immerse
[01:51:40.800 --> 01:51:45.440]   yourself into an art world so that you become familiar with it and then observe.
[01:51:45.440 --> 01:51:49.840]   Also I desperately need to address your chat because there's somebody named Addis Cinque
[01:51:49.840 --> 01:51:50.840]   there.
[01:51:50.840 --> 01:51:54.640]   Addis Cinque we have two different, William gives the novels with two different cases
[01:51:54.640 --> 01:51:56.240]   of hunting done an artist.
[01:51:56.240 --> 01:52:01.280]   In Count Zero it's Marley Krzstova the curator who goes to look for the AI Winter Mute who's
[01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:03.800]   making the little boxes and pastetias.
[01:52:03.800 --> 01:52:08.600]   In pattern recognition it's Case Pollard who finds the video artist Noro who's doing
[01:52:08.600 --> 01:52:09.600]   video remixes.
[01:52:09.600 --> 01:52:11.560]   Who's doing video remixes.
[01:52:11.560 --> 01:52:13.200]   Two completely different.
[01:52:13.200 --> 01:52:14.200]   They're very similar.
[01:52:14.200 --> 01:52:15.200]   Well done.
[01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:18.520]   Very similar in that you're hunting down somebody but in this case I was specifically
[01:52:18.520 --> 01:52:23.280]   referencing the Winter Mute built collages in Count Zero for a reason.
[01:52:23.280 --> 01:52:24.280]   There you go.
[01:52:24.280 --> 01:52:25.280]   Thank you.
[01:52:25.280 --> 01:52:26.280]   I'm sorry I just had to get that on my side.
[01:52:26.280 --> 01:52:28.520]   Are we excited about the peripheral being made into a TV show?
[01:52:28.520 --> 01:52:30.800]   Oh my gosh I'm so excited.
[01:52:30.800 --> 01:52:35.880]   I plan on assessing him on some merits but I'm also really looking forward to seeing how
[01:52:35.880 --> 01:52:38.160]   Gibson gets adapted as a serial format.
[01:52:38.160 --> 01:52:39.160]   I love William Gibson.
[01:52:39.160 --> 01:52:41.520]   He wrote Nurem Answer which was Transformation.
[01:52:41.520 --> 01:52:42.520]   Oh my gosh.
[01:52:42.520 --> 01:52:43.520]   And Cyberpunk.
[01:52:43.520 --> 01:52:47.800]   I would argue the Blue Man Trilogy is probably the most accurate future casting of the 21st
[01:52:47.800 --> 01:52:49.800]   century that we've seen so far.
[01:52:49.800 --> 01:52:54.800]   It's pattern recognition, spook country and oh my gosh I'm blank.
[01:52:54.800 --> 01:52:55.800]   I'm reading the peripheral now.
[01:52:55.800 --> 01:52:59.000]   I didn't read it before because I want to read it before the TV show comes out.
[01:52:59.000 --> 01:53:00.200]   Addis Cinque you're a critical person.
[01:53:00.200 --> 01:53:04.680]   There's a great concept of Polts which are poltergeist basically which are spirits from
[01:53:04.680 --> 01:53:08.200]   another previous world I guess.
[01:53:08.200 --> 01:53:11.320]   And being used in our world which is fascinating.
[01:53:11.320 --> 01:53:13.240]   Anyway back to AI art.
[01:53:13.240 --> 01:53:14.240]   Sorry.
[01:53:14.240 --> 01:53:15.240]   You were talking about Harvard.
[01:53:15.240 --> 01:53:17.280]   Yeah Harvard has something called the Studio Habits of Mind.
[01:53:17.280 --> 01:53:25.080]   There are eight separate habits that they argue contribute to an active daily practice
[01:53:25.080 --> 01:53:27.120]   of craft and creation.
[01:53:27.120 --> 01:53:32.240]   And among those eight habits of mind you do have a Mercer self in the art community so
[01:53:32.240 --> 01:53:33.840]   you can understand it better.
[01:53:33.840 --> 01:53:35.120]   So that's a question.
[01:53:35.120 --> 01:53:37.040]   We all have to say I do that.
[01:53:37.040 --> 01:53:41.680]   As I said if I've seen farther than others it's because I stood in the shoulder of giants.
[01:53:41.680 --> 01:53:46.600]   We all learn from our predecessors and I learned from Ken Nordine.
[01:53:46.600 --> 01:53:50.940]   I wish I were as good as Ken Nordine but if you said oh you can't sound anything like
[01:53:50.940 --> 01:53:55.960]   Ken Nordine well come on that's how art works.
[01:53:55.960 --> 01:53:59.840]   Now I've seen like we saw a soy marina and axe murderer as our Friday Night Family
[01:53:59.840 --> 01:54:04.840]   movie and it's such a San Francisco little movie but Ken Nordine I was like oh my god
[01:54:04.840 --> 01:54:05.840]   that's what my Myers.
[01:54:05.840 --> 01:54:08.840]   No but that's what Mike Myers does is a jazz poet.
[01:54:08.840 --> 01:54:10.440]   Mike Myers is game.
[01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:14.680]   You can tell it's fiction is Mike Myers is gamefully employed as a jazz poet.
[01:54:14.680 --> 01:54:23.240]   And he does but there's the snapping and it really I like when you introduce me to Nordine
[01:54:23.240 --> 01:54:27.880]   I was like oh my god I've heard this before and I just realized it was a pasty tribute.
[01:54:27.880 --> 01:54:32.440]   Oh my gosh I love when those things click in your head.
[01:54:32.440 --> 01:54:33.440]   I know it's so exciting.
[01:54:33.440 --> 01:54:37.360]   But to address what you're talking about Shelley I think you should be able to use AI
[01:54:37.360 --> 01:54:40.720]   generators as a small blog for illustrations.
[01:54:40.720 --> 01:54:42.840]   Here's what Ben Thompson on his blog.
[01:54:42.840 --> 01:54:44.560]   It's such a good blog.
[01:54:44.560 --> 01:54:47.880]   Normally illustrates with napkin drawings.
[01:54:47.880 --> 01:54:51.040]   He went to mid journey so he's writing about his first job as a paper boy.
[01:54:51.040 --> 01:54:53.200]   He went to mid journey and created an image.
[01:54:53.200 --> 01:54:55.600]   I think these are beautiful.
[01:54:55.600 --> 01:54:56.760]   I don't think they think.
[01:54:56.760 --> 01:55:02.120]   It's so much so much to a DJ you know mixing you know grabbing sounds to mix mix their
[01:55:02.120 --> 01:55:07.240]   music I mean we sort of a long tradition of integrating other people's work into our
[01:55:07.240 --> 01:55:10.440]   work some of which is legitimate some of which is.
[01:55:10.440 --> 01:55:14.040]   And I guess the point I was trying to make was not so much that it shouldn't exist but
[01:55:14.040 --> 01:55:18.520]   that there should be full disclosure about the provenance of something so that whether
[01:55:18.520 --> 01:55:22.560]   your goal is to protect the interests of a living artist or whether you're just trying
[01:55:22.560 --> 01:55:27.040]   to give credit where credit is due or whether you find something beautiful and want to know
[01:55:27.040 --> 01:55:30.920]   whether you're allowed to use it or not you know what the source is.
[01:55:30.920 --> 01:55:35.640]   And I think what specifically referencing what what Getty is doing is that I mean they're
[01:55:35.640 --> 01:55:39.520]   banning it because frankly they probably don't know enough about it and they're probably saying
[01:55:39.520 --> 01:55:44.560]   well we need to make it go away until either we figure it out or until the culture at large
[01:55:44.560 --> 01:55:48.720]   figures it out and then we can be sort of a trailing edge because that makes sense and
[01:55:48.720 --> 01:55:51.160]   they make an awful lot of money doing this stuff.
[01:55:51.160 --> 01:55:54.320]   They want they want a great group of coming after them and I don't.
[01:55:54.320 --> 01:55:58.960]   Right and I'm thinking about it as a user and I you know as a potential Getty customer
[01:55:58.960 --> 01:56:03.240]   and thinking I appreciate that it doesn't mean that I'm being a Luddite in terms of whether
[01:56:03.240 --> 01:56:09.240]   AI art is a good or a bad thing it just means let's understand the implications of it before
[01:56:09.240 --> 01:56:13.200]   we throw it out there in the context where we don't have full rights you know.
[01:56:13.200 --> 01:56:18.120]   I screw rights I'm all of a person I just played like four movie cuts today.
[01:56:18.120 --> 01:56:23.000]   But honestly you know I in fact even said we need to install a stable diffusion on a
[01:56:23.000 --> 01:56:28.320]   computer here so we could start using it for thumbnails for our shows or album art stuff.
[01:56:28.320 --> 01:56:34.480]   I mean look we hired and used a very good design company to to redo our album art a
[01:56:34.480 --> 01:56:37.720]   few weeks ago we paid a lot of money for it and I'm glad to do it and I wouldn't want
[01:56:37.720 --> 01:56:42.040]   to replace the human artist that's to me the bigger question is like are these going to
[01:56:42.040 --> 01:56:46.860]   get so good that you don't need humans to do it I don't think that's a problem but I'm
[01:56:46.860 --> 01:56:51.800]   not worried about appropriation I think this is this is art.
[01:56:51.800 --> 01:56:55.600]   This is something Larry Lassig when he started Creative Commons and Corey Doctor have talked
[01:56:55.600 --> 01:57:00.640]   a lot about no artist creates in a vacuum and and that's why stuff has to go out of
[01:57:00.640 --> 01:57:06.560]   copyright that's why you need a public domain because you know Disney you know did the
[01:57:06.560 --> 01:57:11.080]   Brims fairy tales right of course as soon as Disney made those movies he made sure that
[01:57:11.080 --> 01:57:15.920]   no one else would do it he pulled a ladder right up out behind him but that's not how
[01:57:15.920 --> 01:57:21.160]   it works it should work we continue to you know that's the grist for the mill that's
[01:57:21.160 --> 01:57:26.280]   the so I don't think I have a problem at all with these even just because they're AIs
[01:57:26.280 --> 01:57:31.800]   I mean I don't think that's that's problematic let's let them go there's and I think it's
[01:57:31.800 --> 01:57:36.920]   really interesting how it's exploded as soon as people could install it on their own computer
[01:57:36.920 --> 01:57:41.880]   right when it was a limited access to Dolly you know you have to get in I've I applied
[01:57:41.880 --> 01:57:46.520]   for an invitation I've never gotten an invitation years you know it seems like years and months
[01:57:46.520 --> 01:57:54.360]   later but I can run mid-journey I can run a stable diffusion on my own computer now open
[01:57:54.360 --> 01:58:00.280]   AI has open sourced a speech recognition system and I think we're going to maybe see
[01:58:00.280 --> 01:58:06.880]   the same explosion the Cambrian explosion we've seen of art with this it's called Wisp
[01:58:06.880 --> 01:58:12.920]   Bursper it has a variety of different training models I guess I have to go to the site to
[01:58:12.920 --> 01:58:20.480]   see this you can download it it's written in Python and when you and it's a command line
[01:58:20.480 --> 01:58:26.560]   but apparently for people who have been using it it's better than anything Google or Apple
[01:58:26.560 --> 01:58:32.360]   or anybody else is doing now there are people transcriptionists who say well that's now
[01:58:32.360 --> 01:58:39.240]   I'm out of a job there's Otter AI and other companies that are selling this that's life
[01:58:39.240 --> 01:58:47.840]   right the thing I'm super curious about is how will with a handle accents apparently very
[01:58:47.840 --> 01:58:54.000]   well how old do they handle speech impediments that I don't know but apparently it's surprisingly
[01:58:54.000 --> 01:58:59.520]   from their views ever it's surprisingly good at accented speech you have a multilingual
[01:58:59.520 --> 01:59:05.360]   models so that means you could translate from one language into another and transcribe it
[01:59:05.360 --> 01:59:12.720]   I don't know I think this is very interesting six hundred eight thousand hours of audio
[01:59:12.720 --> 01:59:18.520]   collected from the internet they can have all my questions there are questions about
[01:59:18.520 --> 01:59:24.800]   how much of what they've collected is fully representative whether it's whether it's accents
[01:59:24.800 --> 01:59:31.440]   or whether it's speakers in different countries with different sort of not dialect so much
[01:59:31.440 --> 01:59:35.520]   as just different patterns of some might be Castilian Spanish versus Mexican Spanish
[01:59:35.520 --> 01:59:40.000]   right right and so and so there are potential issues I think the open source is the secret
[01:59:40.000 --> 01:59:47.600]   sauce of it because exactly there there are lots of people who are very critical of Google's
[01:59:47.600 --> 01:59:51.320]   captions for example they are affectionately referred to in the hearing impaired community
[01:59:51.320 --> 01:59:57.720]   as craptions and then people are skeptical about apples got this live captions thing coming
[01:59:57.720 --> 02:00:01.760]   out I don't think we really know yet how good it is but but for the people who use it as
[02:00:01.760 --> 02:00:07.640]   an accessibility tool the ability to have text converted to speech is it's amaze balls
[02:00:07.640 --> 02:00:11.880]   and it's also really problematic because it doesn't work nearly as well as it should and
[02:00:11.880 --> 02:00:16.720]   the idea of this being open source is that somebody who really wants to train it and
[02:00:16.720 --> 02:00:23.360]   make it highly tuned to the needs of somebody who is relying on this to understand material
[02:00:23.360 --> 02:00:27.240]   in variety of context because what I like about apples doing and I don't know what apples
[02:00:27.240 --> 02:00:30.920]   doing I don't know how well they're going to do it is they basically said anything that
[02:00:30.920 --> 02:00:36.920]   comes out of your computer we can turn into speech any any or to text rather and that's
[02:00:36.920 --> 02:00:42.400]   ambitious it doesn't necessarily mean it's going to be good but the idea of this being
[02:00:42.400 --> 02:00:47.600]   open source is that it can be applied all over the place and we can continue to continue
[02:00:47.600 --> 02:00:52.960]   to learn so how do that impact right how do that impact right like I've thought about
[02:00:52.960 --> 02:00:56.200]   for example I have a lot of audible books and what's the well I kind of want to read
[02:00:56.200 --> 02:01:01.880]   the book now the easy solution is gotten by the book right on Kindle but I always wondered
[02:01:01.880 --> 02:01:05.760]   could I record the auto you know could I do a transcription of the audible book would
[02:01:05.760 --> 02:01:11.040]   that be legal if I did it for my own purposes you know it'd be cumbersome but but what are
[02:01:11.040 --> 02:01:15.960]   the right issues when you transfer from one medium to another well what's in I don't know
[02:01:15.960 --> 02:01:21.320]   about that but what is interesting is that happens constantly because screen reader technology
[02:01:21.320 --> 02:01:28.280]   or apps that turn you know the diverse right you turn text into speech is are super common
[02:01:28.280 --> 02:01:32.920]   and so people are taking material that exists in book form and they're you know listening
[02:01:32.920 --> 02:01:37.520]   to it as as transcription they tell you if you know they're they're a special copyright
[02:01:37.520 --> 02:01:41.680]   provisions for materials for right but right but that's but but that stuff is not always
[02:01:41.680 --> 02:01:46.040]   handled under those provisions they exist that that that way but it's it happens outside
[02:01:46.040 --> 02:01:52.400]   of it and the quality varies a lot and people who rely on that technology sort of have to
[02:01:52.400 --> 02:01:55.960]   be used to things like synthetic voices which are getting better I know we're talking about
[02:01:55.960 --> 02:02:00.800]   the reverse of what whisper is doing no but so you bring up a really interesting point
[02:02:00.800 --> 02:02:05.920]   which is right now what I'm reading the tech crunch thing is about transcription and or
[02:02:05.920 --> 02:02:11.080]   captions to give an example of there was a little bit of a kerflofel my daughter's
[02:02:11.080 --> 02:02:15.120]   school because when the principal sends out messages their robo that's a it's a robo voice
[02:02:15.120 --> 02:02:19.520]   and not a real voice and people were complaining about this until she said in the PTA meeting
[02:02:19.520 --> 02:02:25.720]   look we serve families who speak 12 different languages in this school so when she said
[02:02:25.720 --> 02:02:30.520]   so when I send out the robo thing what they found is it's easier to translate and have
[02:02:30.520 --> 02:02:36.640]   those played in native languages than it would be if she spoke with her natural rhythms
[02:02:36.640 --> 02:02:41.640]   intonations and dialects so there's something going on with the technology that makes robots
[02:02:41.640 --> 02:02:46.640]   easier to read and scan and it seems like that would be kind of a natural compliment to this
[02:02:46.640 --> 02:02:51.520]   story because if you've got an open source thing that can recognize speech and transcribe
[02:02:51.520 --> 02:02:57.600]   it it would not be that hard to slap on another module that then translates it back into into
[02:02:57.600 --> 02:03:01.920]   audio for somebody which Google actually does already Google does that on there they have
[02:03:01.920 --> 02:03:05.680]   an Android app that does that right where you can speak in one language and it will speak
[02:03:05.680 --> 02:03:12.640]   back in another language right isn't this though a great test of open source versus commercial
[02:03:12.640 --> 02:03:20.760]   yes I I personally think by open sourcing it open AI is going to improve the improve
[02:03:20.760 --> 02:03:25.880]   and a much faster rate just because people same with stable diffusion because people
[02:03:25.880 --> 02:03:30.040]   are training in on new data they're adding new data they're adding new languages I just
[02:03:30.040 --> 02:03:34.600]   I love that and frankly I've been and I'm curious actually what the blind community thinks
[02:03:34.600 --> 02:03:39.320]   but I've been very disappointed with the progress Google Apple Microsoft have made with their
[02:03:39.320 --> 02:03:43.840]   transcription stuff I just it could be so much better I mean it's good it should have
[02:03:43.840 --> 02:03:47.480]   been better once we all started working at home and should have been better it shall
[02:03:47.480 --> 02:03:52.280]   be your sense because there's there's no reason it couldn't have been better and and
[02:03:52.280 --> 02:03:56.760]   not not I think you know what's what's improved is artificial intelligence and machine learning
[02:03:56.760 --> 02:04:02.840]   the actual ability to transcribe given you know given pristine text to turn it into speech
[02:04:02.840 --> 02:04:07.640]   or given speech that is easily understandable and as well recorded and turned into text a
[02:04:07.640 --> 02:04:12.920]   lot of those nuts and bolts have existed and what's changed is we need to use AI because
[02:04:12.920 --> 02:04:15.840]   we have accents and because we have so many different languages and because we want to
[02:04:15.840 --> 02:04:21.000]   do it faster and all that stuff and it feels like it predates the pandemic the pandemic
[02:04:21.000 --> 02:04:25.320]   is sort of a you know good opportunity to say there's more and more use for it because
[02:04:25.320 --> 02:04:30.000]   because now it's really required that if you have zoom or Microsoft Teams or something
[02:04:30.000 --> 02:04:36.080]   like that that early on in the pandemic zoom got better captioning ability than it had before
[02:04:36.080 --> 02:04:40.320]   and it was because people with disabilities were like hey I'm in zoom meetings and I can't
[02:04:40.320 --> 02:04:45.480]   hear what's being said I need captioning and so zoom had to hurry up and improve their
[02:04:45.480 --> 02:04:50.400]   captioning ability.
[02:04:50.400 --> 02:04:59.680]   So this would be a hard thing to caption passengers on a recent American Airlines flight were
[02:04:59.680 --> 02:05:08.960]   puzzled by what seemed to be a hack of their PA system.
[02:05:08.960 --> 02:05:12.080]   Let me see if I can play this for you I don't know if this video has been removed now here
[02:05:12.080 --> 02:05:18.400]   it is this is a a guy on the weirdest flight ever his name is Emerson Collins these sounds
[02:05:18.400 --> 02:05:25.080]   started on the intercom before takeoff continues throughout the flight the flight deck said
[02:05:25.080 --> 02:05:30.720]   as far as we could tell us no danger to us so we're just going to keep on going listen
[02:05:30.720 --> 02:05:46.980]   and you tell me what you think these sounds are coming through the
[02:05:46.980 --> 02:05:50.800]   Doctor.
[02:05:50.800 --> 02:05:54.180]   Very upsetting.
[02:05:54.180 --> 02:05:54.940]   I'm going to be having a really good or really bad day.
[02:05:54.940 --> 02:05:56.940]   They couldn't figure out.
[02:05:56.940 --> 02:05:59.740]   Ladies and gentlemen, we realize there is an extremely irritating sound coming over the
[02:05:59.740 --> 02:06:00.440]   public announcement.
[02:06:00.440 --> 02:06:04.740]   The flight deck is trying to troubleshoot, trying to turn it off.
[02:06:04.740 --> 02:06:10.560]   So please, in a patient with us we know this is a very odd anomaly and a set of us are
[02:06:10.560 --> 02:06:13.560]   enjoying it.
[02:06:13.560 --> 02:06:16.420]   We know appreciate your attention.
[02:06:16.420 --> 02:06:18.820]   The whole flight.
[02:06:18.820 --> 02:06:22.620]   Wow, that's like a form of super political warfare.
[02:06:22.620 --> 02:06:30.260]   American Airlines said, "Who is having a puke yank?"
[02:06:30.260 --> 02:06:32.060]   No, they did not say that.
[02:06:32.060 --> 02:06:33.620]   Oh, wow.
[02:06:33.620 --> 02:06:35.620]   I don't know what that is.
[02:06:35.620 --> 02:06:36.620]   Don't tell me.
[02:06:36.620 --> 02:06:38.420]   It sounds terrible, whatever it is.
[02:06:38.420 --> 02:06:40.020]   It is terrible.
[02:06:40.020 --> 02:06:49.900]   American Airlines in a press release or whatever said, "Let me read this to you because I want
[02:06:49.900 --> 02:06:51.420]   to give them."
[02:06:51.420 --> 02:06:53.980]   The PA system is wired.
[02:06:53.980 --> 02:06:55.260]   It's not Wi-Fi.
[02:06:55.260 --> 02:06:58.100]   It's not Bluetooth.
[02:06:58.100 --> 02:07:04.580]   American Airlines inspected the Boeing 737-800 as well as the PA system when the plane landed.
[02:07:04.580 --> 02:07:10.180]   It's "determined the sounds were caused by an issue with the PA amplifier.
[02:07:10.180 --> 02:07:15.380]   There was no access to the system."
[02:07:15.380 --> 02:07:19.260]   My favorite detail was that it started right after one of those credit card ads.
[02:07:19.260 --> 02:07:20.260]   It did.
[02:07:20.260 --> 02:07:25.300]   It happened at the very end of the credit card offer announcement before the attendant could
[02:07:25.300 --> 02:07:26.340]   hang up the phone.
[02:07:26.340 --> 02:07:27.860]   I hate that they do that on the planes.
[02:07:27.860 --> 02:07:29.580]   They try to, in fact, I fell for it once.
[02:07:29.580 --> 02:07:31.420]   I didn't have another story.
[02:07:31.420 --> 02:07:35.180]   She didn't know what to do since it happened basically while she was on.
[02:07:35.180 --> 02:07:40.740]   Three supervisors or American Airlines management just went on board before first class.
[02:07:40.740 --> 02:07:43.020]   They couldn't figure it out.
[02:07:43.020 --> 02:07:45.940]   They still, as far as I know, haven't figured it out.
[02:07:45.940 --> 02:07:52.140]   In fact, some have tweeted something similar happened on an Airbus.
[02:07:52.140 --> 02:07:56.940]   John, do you know of any way that an analog amplifier could be modified to make it sound
[02:07:56.940 --> 02:08:01.180]   like a human going, "Ugh."
[02:08:01.180 --> 02:08:02.780]   I don't think so.
[02:08:02.780 --> 02:08:10.540]   Let me play it one more time because I want you to listen and be the judge.
[02:08:10.540 --> 02:08:16.380]   I love this guy's facial expressions.
[02:08:16.380 --> 02:08:19.220]   No idea.
[02:08:19.220 --> 02:08:22.220]   I don't know.
[02:08:22.220 --> 02:08:24.220]   Maybe this will be a mystery.
[02:08:24.220 --> 02:08:25.220]   Best up.
[02:08:25.220 --> 02:08:26.220]   That's messy.
[02:08:26.220 --> 02:08:27.220]   But without him, it wouldn't be nearly as much fun.
[02:08:27.220 --> 02:08:28.220]   You gotta watch.
[02:08:28.220 --> 02:08:29.220]   You gotta do it.
[02:08:29.220 --> 02:08:33.240]   One more commercial before we...
[02:08:33.240 --> 02:08:38.460]   I have a few extra stories, but we're about ready to wrap it up if you're wondering.
[02:08:38.460 --> 02:08:41.060]   I know we got the house of the dragon to watch.
[02:08:41.060 --> 02:08:42.940]   We've got places to be, things to do.
[02:08:42.940 --> 02:08:47.900]   Our show today brought you though, and I got to give them a lot of credit by Audible.
[02:08:47.900 --> 02:08:50.660]   Audiobooks from Audible saved my life.
[02:08:50.660 --> 02:08:55.380]   When we came back from the concert, John, on Friday night and I was driving back, Lisa
[02:08:55.380 --> 02:08:57.500]   and I were reminiscing about commutes.
[02:08:57.500 --> 02:09:01.900]   I used to commute for 13 years from San Francisco to Petaloma.
[02:09:01.900 --> 02:09:07.340]   An hour, if there's no traffic, if there's traffic two hours each way, that says from
[02:09:07.340 --> 02:09:13.860]   two to four hours a day sitting in a car, I got so sick of listening to the radio that
[02:09:13.860 --> 02:09:14.860]   Audible came along.
[02:09:14.860 --> 02:09:20.220]   I joined Audible 22 years ago and it saved my life.
[02:09:20.220 --> 02:09:26.060]   Audiobooks from Audible are the best way you can spend time in the car, washing dishes,
[02:09:26.060 --> 02:09:27.060]   walking the dog.
[02:09:27.060 --> 02:09:32.020]   Anytime you can't hold a book, you can listen to audiobooks on Audible in every genre, from
[02:09:32.020 --> 02:09:37.820]   bestsellers to new releases to celebrity memoirs to mysteries and thrillers to motivation,
[02:09:37.820 --> 02:09:39.860]   wellness, business and more.
[02:09:39.860 --> 02:09:41.460]   There's Audible Originals.
[02:09:41.460 --> 02:09:48.380]   In fact, I'm thrilled because Audible has in their frontiers series resurrected some of
[02:09:48.380 --> 02:09:52.940]   the great science fiction novels that were never audio and have put them on audio and
[02:09:52.940 --> 02:09:56.780]   that's such a good job recording them.
[02:09:56.780 --> 02:09:59.820]   They have the Sandman, Neil Gaiman Sandman, far better than the TV show to listen to the
[02:09:59.820 --> 02:10:02.020]   radio play that Neil put together.
[02:10:02.020 --> 02:10:03.780]   Incredible parts one and two.
[02:10:03.780 --> 02:10:08.980]   Steve Martin, his born standing up is you have to listen to the audiobook version.
[02:10:08.980 --> 02:10:09.980]   It's so good.
[02:10:09.980 --> 02:10:15.620]   Renowned experts, exciting new voices and audio, even podcasts, commercial free.
[02:10:15.620 --> 02:10:20.580]   As an Audible member, you get to choose a title a month to keep from their entire catalog,
[02:10:20.580 --> 02:10:23.020]   including the latest bestsellers and new releases.
[02:10:23.020 --> 02:10:29.220]   But then you also get access to Audible Originals, podcasts too.
[02:10:29.220 --> 02:10:30.820]   You can listen to all you want.
[02:10:30.820 --> 02:10:31.980]   More get added every month.
[02:10:31.980 --> 02:10:32.980]   It's a great selection.
[02:10:32.980 --> 02:10:37.620]   In fact, I'm really thrilled because Steve Gibson has been telling me about this great
[02:10:37.620 --> 02:10:43.260]   science fiction series that he's loving called The Silver Ships by S.J.
[02:10:43.260 --> 02:10:45.500]   Yucha.
[02:10:45.500 --> 02:10:47.100]   There are, I think, let me just see.
[02:10:47.100 --> 02:10:49.900]   I think there's like 20 of them, right?
[02:10:49.900 --> 02:10:54.140]   It's just a very, very, very long series and Steve likes these.
[02:10:54.140 --> 02:10:57.820]   Yeah, there's like 20 of them.
[02:10:57.820 --> 02:11:00.260]   So I bought the first one, loving it.
[02:11:00.260 --> 02:11:07.300]   Then I discovered that many of the rest of them are already in my Audible libraries, part
[02:11:07.300 --> 02:11:08.780]   of the Audible Originals.
[02:11:08.780 --> 02:11:10.740]   That's so exciting.
[02:11:10.740 --> 02:11:12.460]   That's just one of the great things about Audible.
[02:11:12.460 --> 02:11:15.540]   I've never run out of great things to listen to.
[02:11:15.540 --> 02:11:18.620]   As an Audible member for 22 years, they stay in your library.
[02:11:18.620 --> 02:11:20.900]   You can listen to them anytime.
[02:11:20.900 --> 02:11:27.380]   I just, whether it's fiction or nonfiction, I love the Sound Plus music stuff they do.
[02:11:27.380 --> 02:11:32.300]   You listen to an artist talking about her music and then they play the music.
[02:11:32.300 --> 02:11:33.300]   It's just fantastic.
[02:11:33.300 --> 02:11:37.940]   In fact, I'm going to add a few William Gibson novels to my Audible list.
[02:11:37.940 --> 02:11:40.380]   Larry, you said you were listening to something.
[02:11:40.380 --> 02:11:44.140]   I listened to, I'm looking at Jonathan Newemore at The Big Lie.
[02:11:44.140 --> 02:11:45.140]   Oh.
[02:11:45.140 --> 02:11:47.140]   I'm going to go and listen to a lot of fiction.
[02:11:47.140 --> 02:11:50.300]   I mostly like fiction, not Audible, but I listen to everything.
[02:11:50.300 --> 02:11:51.300]   You know what I do?
[02:11:51.300 --> 02:11:52.300]   I alternate.
[02:11:52.300 --> 02:11:53.300]   Yeah.
[02:11:53.300 --> 02:11:54.300]   I do.
[02:11:54.300 --> 02:11:55.300]   Pretty much.
[02:11:55.300 --> 02:11:58.020]   Because if I listen to a lot of fiction, then I want to hear some nonfiction and vice
[02:11:58.020 --> 02:11:59.020]   versa.
[02:11:59.020 --> 02:12:01.700]   Lately, I've been on a bit of a science fiction binge.
[02:12:01.700 --> 02:12:05.660]   But what's great is I talked earlier about my Fitbit diet and it means I do a lot of
[02:12:05.660 --> 02:12:08.900]   walking to turn up the holidays and that's when I listen.
[02:12:08.900 --> 02:12:11.540]   Walking is so good for you.
[02:12:11.540 --> 02:12:15.420]   My favorite day of the month is a 22nd because that's when I get my Audible credit.
[02:12:15.420 --> 02:12:18.580]   In fact, I think for me, the retention is even better.
[02:12:18.580 --> 02:12:24.140]   There's some audiobooks on Audible that I think are the life of pie I listen to instead
[02:12:24.140 --> 02:12:25.140]   of reading.
[02:12:25.140 --> 02:12:27.140]   I was sobbing at the end.
[02:12:27.140 --> 02:12:29.660]   It came alive for me.
[02:12:29.660 --> 02:12:32.740]   I really identified with it.
[02:12:32.740 --> 02:12:36.980]   You can listen to the Audible app anywhere, anytime I even have Audible now in my new watch
[02:12:36.980 --> 02:12:39.740]   and I downloaded the Silver Ships to my watch.
[02:12:39.740 --> 02:12:41.820]   So I put in my AirPods and I can go for a walk.
[02:12:41.820 --> 02:12:45.380]   Don't even have my phone and listen to my audiobooks while traveling.
[02:12:45.380 --> 02:12:48.180]   I'm working out, walking, doing chores.
[02:12:48.180 --> 02:12:53.300]   Let Audible help you discover new ways to laugh, be inspired, or be entertained.
[02:12:53.300 --> 02:12:58.140]   If you've not yet joined Audible and God knows we've been talking about it for 22 years,
[02:12:58.140 --> 02:13:04.580]   it feels like you can do it for 30 days free when you go to audible.com/twit.
[02:13:04.580 --> 02:13:12.780]   A-U-D-I-B-L-E.com/twit or text Twit to 500-500.
[02:13:12.780 --> 02:13:18.140]   Have you seen my interviews with Andy Weir who wrote the amazing The Martian and his latest
[02:13:18.140 --> 02:13:20.380]   project Hail Mary?
[02:13:20.380 --> 02:13:21.620]   So good.
[02:13:21.620 --> 02:13:25.380]   But let me tell you, the audiobooks are even better because the guy he gets to read his
[02:13:25.380 --> 02:13:29.940]   audiobooks has that he's got the snarky style and sound.
[02:13:29.940 --> 02:13:31.940]   It's so, so good.
[02:13:31.940 --> 02:13:33.300]   I love it.
[02:13:33.300 --> 02:13:40.300]   It's Twit to 500-500 to try Audible for free for 30 days or go to audible.com/twit.
[02:13:40.300 --> 02:13:47.100]   Okay, I could go on and on for Audible for hours.
[02:13:47.100 --> 02:13:49.060]   You must listen to audiobooks, yeah?
[02:13:49.060 --> 02:13:50.060]   Oh yeah.
[02:13:50.060 --> 02:13:52.420]   I listen to quite a bit of audio books.
[02:13:52.420 --> 02:13:55.580]   I love it.
[02:13:55.580 --> 02:13:59.660]   As I get older, my eyes get tireder.
[02:13:59.660 --> 02:14:03.500]   So I try to read a book in bed at night, I get one page and then it hits me in the nose.
[02:14:03.500 --> 02:14:06.580]   So it's just really, it's just really better.
[02:14:06.580 --> 02:14:09.980]   I think it's a better way to enjoy reading.
[02:14:09.980 --> 02:14:11.580]   The Nightcoyle Chicken.
[02:14:11.580 --> 02:14:17.340]   Yeah, it's that, yes, it is much, definitely better than Nightcoyle Chicken.
[02:14:17.340 --> 02:14:23.180]   That's Audible's new slogan, better than Nightcoyle Chicken.
[02:14:23.180 --> 02:14:24.180]   Yeah, that's good.
[02:14:24.180 --> 02:14:25.180]   I like it.
[02:14:25.180 --> 02:14:26.180]   I like it.
[02:14:26.180 --> 02:14:28.580]   I want to cut it out.
[02:14:28.580 --> 02:14:31.900]   James Earl Jones, the voice of Obi-Wan Kenobi.
[02:14:31.900 --> 02:14:32.900]   No, James Earl Jones.
[02:14:32.900 --> 02:14:33.900]   I'm a painter.
[02:14:33.900 --> 02:14:35.900]   I'm going to nerd argue.
[02:14:35.900 --> 02:14:38.580]   Okay, forget it.
[02:14:38.580 --> 02:14:39.580]   Let me release...
[02:14:39.580 --> 02:14:41.580]   Malick in a somewhere from the ground.
[02:14:41.580 --> 02:14:42.580]   Malick in a.
[02:14:42.580 --> 02:14:43.580]   My shop liver.
[02:14:43.580 --> 02:14:44.580]   Leo, Leo.
[02:14:44.580 --> 02:14:46.300]   Well, I actually want to ask you about it.
[02:14:46.300 --> 02:14:47.300]   Well, all right.
[02:14:47.300 --> 02:14:48.900]   First, I've got to show you the promo.
[02:14:48.900 --> 02:14:49.900]   I forgot.
[02:14:49.900 --> 02:14:50.900]   This is what you missed.
[02:14:50.900 --> 02:14:54.100]   If you missed a minute of Twit this week, watch.
[02:14:54.100 --> 02:14:55.100]   Okay.
[02:14:55.100 --> 02:14:57.100]   It's called It's Bananas.
[02:14:57.100 --> 02:14:58.100]   Yeah.
[02:14:58.100 --> 02:15:02.100]   And it is the Monkey Tail Game.
[02:15:02.100 --> 02:15:06.940]   You get two monkey tails and then it comes with a belt and the belt goes around.
[02:15:06.940 --> 02:15:07.940]   You have to wear it.
[02:15:07.940 --> 02:15:08.940]   You have to wear it.
[02:15:08.940 --> 02:15:09.940]   You have to wear it.
[02:15:09.940 --> 02:15:10.940]   Yes.
[02:15:10.940 --> 02:15:16.980]   You have to walk around and bend down and loop and breath.
[02:15:16.980 --> 02:15:18.460]   All right, I'm getting this.
[02:15:18.460 --> 02:15:21.140]   It's a riotous.
[02:15:21.140 --> 02:15:23.700]   Previously on Twit.
[02:15:23.700 --> 02:15:25.780]   Coming up next on Hands on Windows.
[02:15:25.780 --> 02:15:30.860]   We're going to finally take a look at Windows setup and what has changed in Windows 11 version
[02:15:30.860 --> 02:15:32.780]   22H2.
[02:15:32.780 --> 02:15:35.380]   Some of it may surprise you.
[02:15:35.380 --> 02:15:42.060]   This week in Enterprise Tech, 40% of surveyed data scientists, business analysts and students
[02:15:42.060 --> 02:15:47.460]   have scaled back their use of open source components since vulnerabilities in open source
[02:15:47.460 --> 02:15:53.060]   components have forced them to reevaluate the code frequently used in analysis and the
[02:15:53.060 --> 02:15:55.980]   creation of machine learning models.
[02:15:55.980 --> 02:15:56.980]   All about Android.
[02:15:56.980 --> 02:15:58.980]   Here is my Z Fold 4.
[02:15:58.980 --> 02:15:59.980]   Oh, look so stylish.
[02:15:59.980 --> 02:16:03.940]   See, I have a cute Kate Spade case on it.
[02:16:03.940 --> 02:16:04.940]   Ooh.
[02:16:04.940 --> 02:16:11.540]   It is a portable tablet device to the point that using it when it's closed, it might feel
[02:16:11.540 --> 02:16:16.780]   a little awkward because this is a slightly more narrow phone than what you're used to
[02:16:16.780 --> 02:16:18.220]   in the Android world.
[02:16:18.220 --> 02:16:21.540]   It's like this slightly thinner brick.
[02:16:21.540 --> 02:16:22.620]   You can look through it.
[02:16:22.620 --> 02:16:27.620]   You can close all the way.
[02:16:27.620 --> 02:16:29.500]   I can definitely see through it.
[02:16:29.500 --> 02:16:30.500]   Oh, that's weird.
[02:16:30.500 --> 02:16:31.500]   They all have folds.
[02:16:31.500 --> 02:16:33.660]   I'm so jealous.
[02:16:33.660 --> 02:16:34.660]   Make sure you watch.
[02:16:34.660 --> 02:16:35.660]   What is that monkey tail?
[02:16:35.660 --> 02:16:36.980]   Is that a stupidest?
[02:16:36.980 --> 02:16:39.740]   I bought one immediately after you showed it.
[02:16:39.740 --> 02:16:41.420]   You know why?
[02:16:41.420 --> 02:16:43.020]   It's actually a good reason.
[02:16:43.020 --> 02:16:48.580]   When the family gets together for Christmas or Thanksgiving, we need something so that
[02:16:48.580 --> 02:16:50.740]   we don't talk about politics.
[02:16:50.740 --> 02:16:51.740]   Right?
[02:16:51.740 --> 02:16:55.940]   So we always have a stupid game that gets everybody laughing.
[02:16:55.940 --> 02:17:01.340]   In this case, a monkey tail that you have to hook stuff with is nuts.
[02:17:01.340 --> 02:17:04.900]   So we always have this stupid game so that nobody will talk politics.
[02:17:04.900 --> 02:17:08.740]   If you're looking for another stupid game, exploding kitten's game.
[02:17:08.740 --> 02:17:09.740]   Oh, that's wonderful.
[02:17:09.740 --> 02:17:11.500]   How would you treat for Neanderthals?
[02:17:11.500 --> 02:17:12.500]   Oh.
[02:17:12.500 --> 02:17:16.620]   Because it's a game where you have to describe a word on a call.
[02:17:16.620 --> 02:17:21.260]   You have to describe the word in the card using only one syllable words.
[02:17:21.260 --> 02:17:23.660]   So if it's marshmallow face, sweet.
[02:17:23.660 --> 02:17:24.660]   Sweet.
[02:17:24.660 --> 02:17:25.660]   Saw square.
[02:17:25.660 --> 02:17:26.660]   That's great.
[02:17:26.660 --> 02:17:27.660]   I'm ordering.
[02:17:27.660 --> 02:17:31.140]   And the thing is, here's the thing, is if you do not, if you deviate from the one syllable,
[02:17:31.140 --> 02:17:35.180]   the opposing team gets to hit you with a giant inflatable bat called the no-no club.
[02:17:35.180 --> 02:17:36.180]   Okay.
[02:17:36.180 --> 02:17:37.620]   So it's highly recommended for...
[02:17:37.620 --> 02:17:38.620]   Poetry for cavemen.
[02:17:38.620 --> 02:17:39.620]   Yeah.
[02:17:39.620 --> 02:17:40.620]   Poetry for Neanderthals.
[02:17:40.620 --> 02:17:41.620]   Yes.
[02:17:41.620 --> 02:17:45.540]   So, my nephews who were in high school, I'm going to enjoy hitting them on the head with
[02:17:45.540 --> 02:17:46.540]   them.
[02:17:46.540 --> 02:17:48.060]   It is, we played with it.
[02:17:48.060 --> 02:17:51.780]   We played with a bunch of people who are smart enough to get into UC Berkeley, and they were
[02:17:51.780 --> 02:17:52.780]   like, stopped at the...
[02:17:52.780 --> 02:17:53.780]   Oh, yeah.
[02:17:53.780 --> 02:17:54.780]   Single syllables?
[02:17:54.780 --> 02:17:55.780]   What's that?
[02:17:55.780 --> 02:17:56.780]   Yes, exactly.
[02:17:56.780 --> 02:17:57.780]   It was a delay hitting one.
[02:17:57.780 --> 02:17:58.780]   I don't know any words of what's...
[02:17:58.780 --> 02:17:59.780]   So I'm looking at...
[02:17:59.780 --> 02:18:00.780]   I see Berkeley.
[02:18:00.780 --> 02:18:01.780]   I don't think I'm that smart.
[02:18:01.780 --> 02:18:06.460]   My trainer went to Cal, and he can't count to 20.
[02:18:06.460 --> 02:18:08.940]   At least when I lifted weights, he can't.
[02:18:08.940 --> 02:18:11.740]   So every time, he says, "How many is that?"
[02:18:11.740 --> 02:18:12.940]   I don't know.
[02:18:12.940 --> 02:18:17.420]   So we were talking about James Earl Jones, not Alec Guinness.
[02:18:17.420 --> 02:18:19.940]   Although I do love every Alec Guinness movie ever made.
[02:18:19.940 --> 02:18:23.300]   The man in the gray suit, or whites.
[02:18:23.300 --> 02:18:24.300]   Even murder by death.
[02:18:24.300 --> 02:18:25.300]   Murder by death.
[02:18:25.300 --> 02:18:27.780]   That's a later one.
[02:18:27.780 --> 02:18:30.300]   But James Earl Jones, I just learned from the chat rooms.
[02:18:30.300 --> 02:18:31.980]   First movie was...
[02:18:31.980 --> 02:18:32.980]   Anybody?
[02:18:32.980 --> 02:18:34.340]   The Great White Hope?
[02:18:34.340 --> 02:18:35.340]   No.
[02:18:35.340 --> 02:18:36.340]   I know.
[02:18:36.340 --> 02:18:37.340]   Older than that.
[02:18:37.340 --> 02:18:41.580]   He had a bit part in a very famous movie you might know as Dr. Strange Love.
[02:18:41.580 --> 02:18:42.580]   Oh, that's right.
[02:18:42.580 --> 02:18:43.580]   I should know that.
[02:18:43.580 --> 02:18:45.580]   Bob, using Master Safety on electronic...
[02:18:45.580 --> 02:18:46.580]   Slips.
[02:18:46.580 --> 02:18:47.580]   No spoilers.
[02:18:47.580 --> 02:18:51.820]   Hi, many of Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob Bob using Master Safety on electronic electronic...
[02:18:51.820 --> 02:18:52.820]   Nice.
[02:18:52.820 --> 02:18:53.820]   Isn't that amazing?
[02:18:53.820 --> 02:18:57.900]   I knew that somewhere in the back of my brain, and I forgot it.
[02:18:57.900 --> 02:18:58.900]   Oh, well.
[02:18:58.900 --> 02:18:59.900]   Lieutenant Luther Zog.
[02:18:59.900 --> 02:19:00.900]   Luther Zog.
[02:19:00.900 --> 02:19:02.340]   Or on trivia.
[02:19:02.340 --> 02:19:08.180]   So he's also, as you point out, the voice of Obi Wan, "No, Darth Vader!"
[02:19:08.180 --> 02:19:12.860]   I just do that to make you crazy.
[02:19:12.860 --> 02:19:16.020]   But of course, he's 91 now, which I didn't realize.
[02:19:16.020 --> 02:19:20.180]   Yes, and his voice is not the one you're used to.
[02:19:20.180 --> 02:19:25.140]   So there is a company in Ukraine, this is from Vanity Fair.
[02:19:25.140 --> 02:19:26.940]   Their company's called Respeacher.
[02:19:26.940 --> 02:19:33.380]   By the way, they're doing some of this work from bomb shelters because they're in Keve
[02:19:33.380 --> 02:19:42.140]   and Lviv and so forth, that is working on voice synthesis for James Earl Jones for future,
[02:19:42.140 --> 02:19:45.140]   because Darth Vader's voice can't change.
[02:19:45.140 --> 02:19:51.220]   For future Star Wars TV and movies, the last time he had actual dialogue was in the rise
[02:19:51.220 --> 02:19:58.780]   of Skywalker, and at that point he told Lucas, he said, or Disney, I guess, he's looking at
[02:19:58.780 --> 02:20:00.860]   winding down.
[02:20:00.860 --> 02:20:08.820]   So they hired Respeacher, and James Earl Jones has given them full license to duplicate his
[02:20:08.820 --> 02:20:09.820]   voice.
[02:20:09.820 --> 02:20:17.340]   In fact, Jones' family told them how pleased they were with the result of the work, giving
[02:20:17.340 --> 02:20:19.740]   his voice back to the galactic...
[02:20:19.740 --> 02:20:24.060]   I'm really glad that they have a life end to do that, and just not bootlegging his voice.
[02:20:24.060 --> 02:20:27.060]   Yes, and then he benefits from it.
[02:20:27.060 --> 02:20:30.060]   And then he benefits from it.
[02:20:30.060 --> 02:20:31.060]   Yeah.
[02:20:31.060 --> 02:20:32.060]   So...
[02:20:32.060 --> 02:20:35.260]   And I don't know if his contract is better because he's James Earl Jones and has the ability
[02:20:35.260 --> 02:20:39.940]   to benefit from it and sign off on it than somebody else who was hired as a voice actor
[02:20:39.940 --> 02:20:44.020]   and something, and then their character goes on to become important and they want to reuse
[02:20:44.020 --> 02:20:45.980]   it, which I'm sure has happened many times.
[02:20:45.980 --> 02:20:50.540]   Ken was, for a long time as I remember, pissed off about CNN.
[02:20:50.540 --> 02:20:51.540]   This is CNN.
[02:20:51.540 --> 02:20:53.660]   This is, you know, the world's...
[02:20:53.660 --> 02:20:57.980]   Apparently, he was there doing an interview or something, and somebody kind of said, "Hey,
[02:20:57.980 --> 02:21:02.460]   could you say the world's most important news network or something?"
[02:21:02.460 --> 02:21:03.460]   I can't remember what it is.
[02:21:03.460 --> 02:21:04.780]   They haven't used it lately.
[02:21:04.780 --> 02:21:08.780]   So they basically did like in "Bowfinger" where you kind of accidentally captured the...
[02:21:08.780 --> 02:21:11.660]   They got him to say it to a microphone and then used it.
[02:21:11.660 --> 02:21:12.660]   Wow.
[02:21:12.660 --> 02:21:13.660]   And he was a little bit...
[02:21:13.660 --> 02:21:15.900]   They eventually made him whole and he settled.
[02:21:15.900 --> 02:21:16.900]   Well, can we...
[02:21:16.900 --> 02:21:22.620]   Does the article go into detail about the tremendous amount of tech expertise that goes
[02:21:22.620 --> 02:21:24.260]   into generating his voice?
[02:21:24.260 --> 02:21:27.980]   Both from here's how we did a perspective, and also here's how we did it while our country
[02:21:27.980 --> 02:21:29.700]   is currently being shelled perspective.
[02:21:29.700 --> 02:21:30.700]   Yeah, they do.
[02:21:30.700 --> 02:21:31.700]   Because that's what I'm interested in.
[02:21:31.700 --> 02:21:32.700]   They do.
[02:21:32.700 --> 02:21:36.940]   They've maintained a phenomenal continuity of IT operations while they were being shelled.
[02:21:36.940 --> 02:21:37.940]   Yeah.
[02:21:37.940 --> 02:21:38.940]   Bogdan...
[02:21:38.940 --> 02:21:39.940]   And I wonder...
[02:21:39.940 --> 02:21:43.700]   Belyev was working from home when the air raid sirens went off, begins the article.
[02:21:43.700 --> 02:21:48.540]   They hadn't been heard in the city of Lviv since World War II, but it was February 24th,
[02:21:48.540 --> 02:21:53.180]   and Russia had just invaded Ukraine when we heard that missiles were attacking, and
[02:21:53.180 --> 02:21:55.500]   that our internet connection was dropping from parts of the country.
[02:21:55.500 --> 02:21:58.300]   "We got into shelter," says Bogdan.
[02:21:58.300 --> 02:22:02.860]   That meant him, his wife, their dog, and two cats huddling in the center of their building.
[02:22:02.860 --> 02:22:06.380]   It's a shelter in quotes because it was actually our bathroom.
[02:22:06.380 --> 02:22:07.900]   There's a rule of two walls.
[02:22:07.900 --> 02:22:08.900]   Get ready for this.
[02:22:08.900 --> 02:22:10.460]   You need to be behind two walls.
[02:22:10.460 --> 02:22:12.180]   The first wall takes the impact.
[02:22:12.180 --> 02:22:15.700]   The second one stops the small shrapnel.
[02:22:15.700 --> 02:22:19.340]   But for Belyev, the work continued because he needed it to.
[02:22:19.340 --> 02:22:21.900]   People on the other side of the world were relying on them.
[02:22:21.900 --> 02:22:25.660]   The project was a culmination of a passion he'd had since childhood Star Wars.
[02:22:25.660 --> 02:22:30.380]   He's a synthetic speech artist at the Ukrainian startup ReSpeacher.
[02:22:30.380 --> 02:22:36.660]   They use archival recordings and a proprietary AI algorithm to create new dialogue with the
[02:22:36.660 --> 02:22:38.780]   voices of performers from long ago.
[02:22:38.780 --> 02:22:42.100]   Maybe they can get Capooten to a surrender.
[02:22:42.100 --> 02:22:47.580]   Hey, flat.
[02:22:47.580 --> 02:22:51.100]   They worked with Lucasfilm to generate the voice of a young Luke Skywalker for the book
[02:22:51.100 --> 02:22:53.540]   of Baba Fett.
[02:22:53.540 --> 02:22:58.180]   They needed to make James Earl Jones sound like Darth Vader from 45 years ago for the
[02:22:58.180 --> 02:23:03.380]   Obi-Wan Kenobi series.
[02:23:03.380 --> 02:23:09.820]   And even though they were under invasion in shelters all over the country, they continued
[02:23:09.820 --> 02:23:10.820]   working because...
[02:23:10.820 --> 02:23:14.900]   You realize this means that the Twig could go on for the next 200 years.
[02:23:14.900 --> 02:23:17.260]   I am so thrilled about that.
[02:23:17.260 --> 02:23:20.620]   I have hundreds of thousands of hours of my voice.
[02:23:20.620 --> 02:23:27.220]   If they can't fake it by now, I love it.
[02:23:27.220 --> 02:23:33.860]   Mozilla has said that despite the fact that Google's Chrome and all the Chromium derivatives
[02:23:33.860 --> 02:23:41.260]   are going to a new manifest, manifest V3, which will effectively make it impossible for ad
[02:23:41.260 --> 02:23:42.500]   blockers to work.
[02:23:42.500 --> 02:23:46.260]   I wonder why Google would do that.
[02:23:46.260 --> 02:23:47.780]   I don't know.
[02:23:47.780 --> 02:23:54.340]   Mozilla has said Firefox will continue to maintain compatibility with manifest V2, which
[02:23:54.340 --> 02:24:00.700]   means for instance that UBlock Origin, which is the ad blocker I recommend and we all use
[02:24:00.700 --> 02:24:07.260]   around here, will continue to work not with Chrome, not with Edge, not with any other Chromium-based
[02:24:07.260 --> 02:24:09.780]   browser, but will continue to work.
[02:24:09.780 --> 02:24:17.500]   It's the web request API they need so that they can see the content as it's coming through
[02:24:17.500 --> 02:24:21.220]   and block it appropriately.
[02:24:21.220 --> 02:24:26.860]   There are manifest V3 compatible ad blockers, but its operation is somewhat limited by the
[02:24:26.860 --> 02:24:28.740]   lack of that API.
[02:24:28.740 --> 02:24:30.940]   What's the market share that...
[02:24:30.940 --> 02:24:32.740]   No one knows because he gives it away.
[02:24:32.740 --> 02:24:36.140]   No, I was going to say in terms of who's using what browser do we have?
[02:24:36.140 --> 02:24:37.380]   Yes, I'm sure there is.
[02:24:37.380 --> 02:24:39.580]   I think Mozilla is a laggard.
[02:24:39.580 --> 02:24:44.820]   Yeah, because it's fantastic technology, but if it's fantastic technology that doesn't
[02:24:44.820 --> 02:24:48.460]   significantly impact a huge percentage of web users.
[02:24:48.460 --> 02:24:53.740]   I'm, as you can see here, using Firefox and I've used it for years, so that line at the
[02:24:53.740 --> 02:24:57.380]   very top of the graph, that green line, what do you think that is?
[02:24:57.380 --> 02:24:58.380]   That's Chrome.
[02:24:58.380 --> 02:25:00.060]   This is globally according to Sateesta.
[02:25:00.060 --> 02:25:02.180]   I'm sorry, statcounter.com.
[02:25:02.180 --> 02:25:05.220]   Chrome is 65% of the browser market.
[02:25:05.220 --> 02:25:08.780]   Number two, Safari because you got no choice.
[02:25:08.780 --> 02:25:09.780]   On iPhones.
[02:25:09.780 --> 02:25:11.620]   It's on phones and tablets, yeah.
[02:25:11.620 --> 02:25:18.620]   It's 18%, and then there's a big clump at the bottom starting with Firefox 3% as of last
[02:25:18.620 --> 02:25:19.620]   month.
[02:25:19.620 --> 02:25:20.620]   It's kind of hilarious.
[02:25:20.620 --> 02:25:23.340]   This is how Safari has managed to actually keep any position as well.
[02:25:23.340 --> 02:25:24.580]   We dominate the mobile.
[02:25:24.580 --> 02:25:25.580]   Yeah, we just lock you in.
[02:25:25.580 --> 02:25:29.500]   You can't use anything but Safari, even if you're using Chrome on iOS, you're using
[02:25:29.500 --> 02:25:30.500]   WebKit.
[02:25:30.500 --> 02:25:32.820]   I use Firefox for that reason also.
[02:25:32.820 --> 02:25:36.420]   I want to make sure that it is not a monoculture in the browser world.
[02:25:36.420 --> 02:25:37.420]   We need some competition.
[02:25:37.420 --> 02:25:39.660]   Yeah, I do too, and I've been happy with it.
[02:25:39.660 --> 02:25:40.660]   It's great.
[02:25:40.660 --> 02:25:42.420]   But it's also a really good browser.
[02:25:42.420 --> 02:25:44.420]   Yeah, I love every single instance.
[02:25:44.420 --> 02:25:45.420]   Got extensions that I want.
[02:25:45.420 --> 02:25:46.420]   I can see my bookmarks.
[02:25:46.420 --> 02:25:47.420]   Those are...
[02:25:47.420 --> 02:25:48.420]   Exactly, yeah.
[02:25:48.420 --> 02:25:51.580]   Does the story basically mean the end of effective ad blocking technology for people
[02:25:51.580 --> 02:25:53.460]   on the world's number one browser?
[02:25:53.460 --> 02:25:54.660]   Or on the number one browser, sure?
[02:25:54.660 --> 02:25:58.900]   Well, this is an interesting question because Safari has done something the same similar,
[02:25:58.900 --> 02:25:59.900]   right?
[02:25:59.900 --> 02:26:00.900]   Mm-hmm.
[02:26:00.900 --> 02:26:01.900]   And you...
[02:26:01.900 --> 02:26:05.260]   The ad blockers on Safari, in my opinion, are very weak, right?
[02:26:05.260 --> 02:26:06.740]   You can get them.
[02:26:06.740 --> 02:26:10.940]   But I think because they've done something similar now, Google's excuse is going to be...
[02:26:10.940 --> 02:26:12.940]   Well, this is a security thing.
[02:26:12.940 --> 02:26:18.220]   We don't want third-party extensions to be able to watch your traffic.
[02:26:18.220 --> 02:26:21.580]   But if you want an ad blocker, that's kind of a necessity.
[02:26:21.580 --> 02:26:22.580]   So...
[02:26:22.580 --> 02:26:26.860]   Like Apple's excuse for controlling the app store, not letting independence...
[02:26:26.860 --> 02:26:27.860]   Security.
[02:26:27.860 --> 02:26:28.860]   Yeah, that's all about security.
[02:26:28.860 --> 02:26:29.860]   Protect the children.
[02:26:29.860 --> 02:26:30.860]   Yeah, we're doing it for you.
[02:26:30.860 --> 02:26:31.860]   We're taking children.
[02:26:31.860 --> 02:26:32.860]   Yeah.
[02:26:32.860 --> 02:26:33.860]   All right, one last since we're talking movies.
[02:26:33.860 --> 02:26:37.900]   We just Star Trek The Motion Picture, finally done.
[02:26:37.900 --> 02:26:46.300]   Now, you may think that you saw Star Trek The Motion Picture 43 years ago, but it was
[02:26:46.300 --> 02:26:47.300]   a...
[02:26:47.300 --> 02:26:51.540]   Now, Robert Wise, who directed it, always thought it was a...
[02:26:51.540 --> 02:26:52.540]   It was thin-grue.
[02:26:52.540 --> 02:26:56.980]   He eventually released a director's cut in the year 2000 on DVD.
[02:26:56.980 --> 02:26:59.500]   But even then, it wasn't what he intended.
[02:26:59.500 --> 02:27:02.700]   The reason is there were so many tie-ins.
[02:27:02.700 --> 02:27:09.500]   There were so many theaters that were expecting Star Trek The Motion Picture, which, incidentally,
[02:27:09.500 --> 02:27:16.660]   was scheduled to come out just right before this thing called Star Wars.
[02:27:16.660 --> 02:27:19.540]   And they literally could not let it slip.
[02:27:19.540 --> 02:27:26.700]   In fact, when they had the preview, Robert Wise delivered the last reel of the film,
[02:27:26.700 --> 02:27:31.340]   literally wet with the chemicals from the developer.
[02:27:31.340 --> 02:27:35.100]   He says he flew to Washington, D.C. for the premiere, slept with the film under his bed
[02:27:35.100 --> 02:27:39.540]   that night and brought it into the theater.
[02:27:39.540 --> 02:27:42.700]   And the problem was it was a rough cut.
[02:27:42.700 --> 02:27:46.420]   And there's actually this great article at Up Rocks talking about what a rough cut is.
[02:27:46.420 --> 02:27:50.980]   It's the first pass at the editing, where you're just getting everything in order.
[02:27:50.980 --> 02:27:52.420]   And then you're going to tighten it up.
[02:27:52.420 --> 02:27:55.420]   You're going to shorten by a frame or two or many.
[02:27:55.420 --> 02:27:57.940]   You're going to have it work better.
[02:27:57.940 --> 02:28:00.180]   They never got to do that.
[02:28:00.180 --> 02:28:09.660]   So if you've been waiting for it, there's a fella who has been editing this ever since.
[02:28:09.660 --> 02:28:14.020]   He says 1,500 additional edits.
[02:28:14.020 --> 02:28:17.260]   And this is his name is David Fine.
[02:28:17.260 --> 02:28:20.460]   Robert Wise died about 15 years ago.
[02:28:20.460 --> 02:28:22.340]   Has been working on this ever since.
[02:28:22.340 --> 02:28:27.620]   They've been releasing a 4K disc, which is important too because the original effects
[02:28:27.620 --> 02:28:29.420]   were not 4K.
[02:28:29.420 --> 02:28:32.020]   So they remastered the effects, which are done by Douglas Trumbull.
[02:28:32.020 --> 02:28:36.320]   The guy who wrote this article said, Mike Ryan, who's a senior at a Tammett writer at
[02:28:36.320 --> 02:28:40.700]   Up Rocks, said, "This is the most gorgeous stunning creation, literally one of the most
[02:28:40.700 --> 02:28:43.420]   beautiful movies I've ever seen."
[02:28:43.420 --> 02:28:46.780]   So I can't wait.
[02:28:46.780 --> 02:28:50.100]   15 or so, 100 edits or so.
[02:28:50.100 --> 02:28:52.900]   He says the motion picture, start to take the motion picture, is finally a film that
[02:28:52.900 --> 02:28:58.500]   feels properly paced, looks stunning, and no longer keeps the viewers at arms like.
[02:28:58.500 --> 02:29:00.180]   So maybe that should be.
[02:29:00.180 --> 02:29:03.460]   That's a vintage film 43 years ago.
[02:29:03.460 --> 02:29:09.940]   I mean, the article sounded almost hyperbolic because my memory, it has been a really long
[02:29:09.940 --> 02:29:13.900]   time since I've seen "Start Check The Motion Picture," and I've felt like most people do,
[02:29:13.900 --> 02:29:17.060]   especially when you see the wrath of Khan afterwards and you're like, "Oh, that's how
[02:29:17.060 --> 02:29:18.820]   we do this dark picture."
[02:29:18.820 --> 02:29:25.740]   And so reading this, I guess I'm having trouble thinking about editing and pacing and even
[02:29:25.740 --> 02:29:29.340]   improvements visually, making that so much better a movie.
[02:29:29.340 --> 02:29:32.260]   I would absolutely watch it, 100%.
[02:29:32.260 --> 02:29:38.100]   And as we joke over on "The Uncomparable," that's entirely too new a movie for Mike.
[02:29:38.100 --> 02:29:39.660]   I will watch it on somebody else's.
[02:29:39.660 --> 02:29:42.860]   Is it kind of mind-boggling that it's 43 years old?
[02:29:42.860 --> 02:29:43.860]   That to me is like...
[02:29:43.860 --> 02:29:44.860]   Are you...
[02:29:44.860 --> 02:29:45.860]   Every...
[02:29:45.860 --> 02:29:47.020]   Everything mind boggles that it's 40 years old.
[02:29:47.020 --> 02:29:52.260]   I've been watching a fair number of 70s and 80s movies recently just for giggles and,
[02:29:52.260 --> 02:29:56.700]   yeah, the age of them relative to my own life experience is just annoying.
[02:29:56.700 --> 02:29:57.940]   They also look pretty dated.
[02:29:57.940 --> 02:29:59.980]   I have to say there was a period of film went through.
[02:29:59.980 --> 02:30:04.060]   It really was just more dated than even older films for some reason.
[02:30:04.060 --> 02:30:05.060]   Yeah.
[02:30:05.060 --> 02:30:06.060]   Well, you have expectations.
[02:30:06.060 --> 02:30:10.660]   Like, once you sort of get into, and black and white, I think changes it to, like, you're
[02:30:10.660 --> 02:30:11.900]   like, "Okay, I'm in a different world.
[02:30:11.900 --> 02:30:12.900]   I'm in a black and white movie."
[02:30:12.900 --> 02:30:17.780]   But if you see a dated looking color movie from the 70s, especially with something like
[02:30:17.780 --> 02:30:22.180]   with science, with sci-fi and special effects and stuff like that, I think that's probably
[02:30:22.180 --> 02:30:26.060]   more annoying than just sort of some sort of family drama from the big 50s.
[02:30:26.060 --> 02:30:27.660]   It's black and white.
[02:30:27.660 --> 02:30:29.180]   I still like early-connected color.
[02:30:29.180 --> 02:30:30.180]   I mean, I don't know.
[02:30:30.180 --> 02:30:31.180]   I'm just a sucker for that.
[02:30:31.180 --> 02:30:32.180]   There is a look to it.
[02:30:32.180 --> 02:30:33.180]   Yeah.
[02:30:33.180 --> 02:30:34.180]   There is a look to it.
[02:30:34.180 --> 02:30:35.180]   But I love it.
[02:30:35.180 --> 02:30:36.180]   Anyway, I thought I mentioned that.
[02:30:36.180 --> 02:30:37.180]   I'm a Star Trek fan.
[02:30:37.180 --> 02:30:38.900]   I'm sure many of our listeners are.
[02:30:38.900 --> 02:30:43.660]   It is going to come out on DVD on UHD, but I will hope that the streamers will pick it
[02:30:43.660 --> 02:30:47.180]   up at some point because I haven't bought a DVD in a long time.
[02:30:47.180 --> 02:30:48.180]   I mean, either.
[02:30:48.180 --> 02:30:50.940]   My Blu-ray player broke and I haven't even replaced it.
[02:30:50.940 --> 02:30:58.780]   We went to, Lisa and I went to see, I think mentioned this before, Motley Crew, and Def
[02:30:58.780 --> 02:31:00.180]   Leopard.
[02:31:00.180 --> 02:31:08.740]   The Shriners were circulating, raising money, and they were selling Motley Crew CDs.
[02:31:08.740 --> 02:31:12.020]   And so Lisa, being a good citizen, bought one instead of the people sitting around us.
[02:31:12.020 --> 02:31:14.100]   And then we all looked at them and said, "What are we going to do with these?
[02:31:14.100 --> 02:31:16.060]   We don't have a CD player.
[02:31:16.060 --> 02:31:17.060]   We're going to put this."
[02:31:17.060 --> 02:31:22.860]   Well, you know how the tipsters and the early aughts got into vinyl, like really into vinyl.
[02:31:22.860 --> 02:31:24.300]   Do you think they'll get the CDs?
[02:31:24.300 --> 02:31:28.420]   I would love it if the next generation of hipsters decided that CDs was like their
[02:31:28.420 --> 02:31:30.980]   thing to ironically embrace as authenticity.
[02:31:30.980 --> 02:31:31.980]   Oh, God.
[02:31:31.980 --> 02:31:33.140]   I certainly hope.
[02:31:33.140 --> 02:31:34.140]   I don't know.
[02:31:34.140 --> 02:31:35.140]   Oh, my gosh.
[02:31:35.140 --> 02:31:37.660]   I can just see it now.
[02:31:37.660 --> 02:31:41.220]   Like I wrote little soul patches and CDs.
[02:31:41.220 --> 02:31:45.380]   That means guys, my age will have to start reviving eight tracks.
[02:31:45.380 --> 02:31:46.380]   Yes.
[02:31:46.380 --> 02:31:52.060]   Oh, I never had an eight track, but I had a lot of good sets.
[02:31:52.060 --> 02:31:54.340]   Lisa, you're going to be busy in just a few days.
[02:31:54.340 --> 02:31:57.140]   You've got Enterprise Connect is coming up September 28th.
[02:31:57.140 --> 02:31:58.980]   Why don't you give a plug for this?
[02:31:58.980 --> 02:31:59.980]   What is it?
[02:31:59.980 --> 02:32:00.980]   Sure thing.
[02:32:00.980 --> 02:32:05.620]   Enterprise Connect is an in-person show every March where we spend four days diving into
[02:32:05.620 --> 02:32:08.300]   the complexities of the communication stack.
[02:32:08.300 --> 02:32:13.300]   Again, from basic level networking all the way up through demands on call centers, contact
[02:32:13.300 --> 02:32:18.980]   centers, up to collaborative communication systems and unified communication systems.
[02:32:18.980 --> 02:32:21.820]   We've done a lot with Zoom, Slack, Microsoft Teams.
[02:32:21.820 --> 02:32:22.820]   Interesting.
[02:32:22.820 --> 02:32:23.820]   It's been a big thing for us.
[02:32:23.820 --> 02:32:28.540]   One of the topics that we've seen a great amount of interest from our audience is on
[02:32:28.540 --> 02:32:29.540]   hybrid work.
[02:32:29.540 --> 02:32:32.580]   Namely, they're the folks who are responsible for making it work.
[02:32:32.580 --> 02:32:36.460]   If you're working at home and you need to troubleshoot Zoom, my readers are the ones
[02:32:36.460 --> 02:32:40.340]   who are going to be the folks that make sure that your meetings still run.
[02:32:40.340 --> 02:32:44.780]   If you're in a hybrid situation like we are here where we've got two folks in the chat.
[02:32:44.780 --> 02:32:45.780]   Yes, we are, aren't we?
[02:32:45.780 --> 02:32:46.780]   Exactly.
[02:32:46.780 --> 02:32:47.780]   I didn't think of that.
[02:32:47.780 --> 02:32:50.900]   It's a whole new way of working and having conversations.
[02:32:50.900 --> 02:32:54.980]   We're pleased to be holding a big virtual event around this.
[02:32:54.980 --> 02:33:02.620]   We've got some really great sessions on how to identify the issues in the hybrid workplace,
[02:33:02.620 --> 02:33:07.900]   what it means to set up a meeting room so it's accessible and giving everybody an equality
[02:33:07.900 --> 02:33:12.940]   of experience, what it means to be transforming a contact center when you no longer have a
[02:33:12.940 --> 02:33:16.100]   bunch of people in a bullpen, but they're all over the place.
[02:33:16.100 --> 02:33:21.500]   More importantly, how new 911 run regulations are going to work when your workforce is distributed,
[02:33:21.500 --> 02:33:28.420]   but you're still under obligation to make sure that if the worst happens, Searching Rescue
[02:33:28.420 --> 02:33:29.420]   can get to them in time.
[02:33:29.420 --> 02:33:30.420]   Oh, I didn't even think of that.
[02:33:30.420 --> 02:33:32.940]   If you're working at home, you're still an employee.
[02:33:32.940 --> 02:33:35.780]   The company still has a responsibility.
[02:33:35.780 --> 02:33:37.020]   Holy cow.
[02:33:37.020 --> 02:33:38.020]   That's going to be interesting.
[02:33:38.020 --> 02:33:39.020]   Enterprise Connect.
[02:33:39.020 --> 02:33:42.700]   You can go to enterpriseconnect.com and register for free.
[02:33:42.700 --> 02:33:43.700]   It's free.
[02:33:43.700 --> 02:33:44.860]   Yes, please come.
[02:33:44.860 --> 02:33:50.300]   It's coming up September 28th, 11.30 AM to 6 PM and you're the director of the program.
[02:33:50.300 --> 02:33:51.820]   So I bet it's going to be really good.
[02:33:51.820 --> 02:33:54.020]   My boss Eric Krap is the one who put this one together.
[02:33:54.020 --> 02:33:59.220]   I'm the program co-chair for the live interview, but I have been helping to coordinate coverage
[02:33:59.220 --> 02:34:00.500]   of this before the show.
[02:34:00.500 --> 02:34:01.500]   Smart.
[02:34:01.500 --> 02:34:02.500]   Very political.
[02:34:02.500 --> 02:34:03.500]   Got to give your boss credit.
[02:34:03.500 --> 02:34:04.500]   Oh, he keeps it right off.
[02:34:04.500 --> 02:34:05.500]   Absolutely.
[02:34:05.500 --> 02:34:07.940]   Please, this reminds her rights for nojitter.com.
[02:34:07.940 --> 02:34:09.540]   It edits it in charge of it.
[02:34:09.540 --> 02:34:11.500]   You're editor in chief.
[02:34:11.500 --> 02:34:12.580]   Thank you so much for being here.
[02:34:12.580 --> 02:34:14.260]   It's so great to see you.
[02:34:14.260 --> 02:34:15.260]   Your family's here.
[02:34:15.260 --> 02:34:16.260]   I know.
[02:34:16.260 --> 02:34:17.260]   Hello, family.
[02:34:17.260 --> 02:34:18.260]   Are you the Girl Scout?
[02:34:18.260 --> 02:34:19.260]   Where's my cookies?
[02:34:19.260 --> 02:34:21.260]   Oh, poor girl.
[02:34:21.260 --> 02:34:23.100]   She's now putting her on the spot.
[02:34:23.100 --> 02:34:25.180]   You'll have to say you'll have me in the winter, sweetie.
[02:34:25.180 --> 02:34:27.420]   Do you have some nuts for me anyway?
[02:34:27.420 --> 02:34:28.420]   No.
[02:34:28.420 --> 02:34:29.420]   That's October.
[02:34:29.420 --> 02:34:30.420]   Oh, okay.
[02:34:30.420 --> 02:34:31.420]   Next month.
[02:34:31.420 --> 02:34:32.420]   Okay.
[02:34:32.420 --> 02:34:33.420]   Next month.
[02:34:33.420 --> 02:34:34.420]   Yeah.
[02:34:34.420 --> 02:34:35.420]   Nice to see.
[02:34:35.420 --> 02:34:36.420]   There you go.
[02:34:36.420 --> 02:34:38.420]   Thank you, Larry Maggad.
[02:34:38.420 --> 02:34:41.900]   Connects safely.org.
[02:34:41.900 --> 02:34:47.460]   You just put out, I shouldn't laugh, the new Connects safely guide to teen sex extortion.
[02:34:47.460 --> 02:34:48.940]   Oh, God.
[02:34:48.940 --> 02:34:50.300]   It's not funny, but it's serious.
[02:34:50.300 --> 02:34:56.220]   I mean, if you're teen, if you have a teenage boy who is getting nude pictures from a teenage
[02:34:56.220 --> 02:34:59.580]   girl, well, it probably isn't a girl or probably a teen.
[02:34:59.580 --> 02:35:00.580]   Oh, no.
[02:35:00.580 --> 02:35:06.540]   And then don't reciprocate by sending a picture because that person or that crime syndicate
[02:35:06.540 --> 02:35:09.140]   may very well get back to financial demand.
[02:35:09.140 --> 02:35:11.580]   That's a nightmare because you would be liable.
[02:35:11.580 --> 02:35:13.220]   A holy cow.
[02:35:13.220 --> 02:35:14.940]   Oh, serious stuff.
[02:35:14.940 --> 02:35:18.140]   On a brighter note, we have a let you go to our explore by topic section, you'll find
[02:35:18.140 --> 02:35:21.860]   some a lot of other new stuff, including a lot of stuff on the metaverse.
[02:35:21.860 --> 02:35:26.420]   We're not sure how the metaverse is going to turn out or what exactly what it is, but
[02:35:26.420 --> 02:35:27.780]   we will try to make it a safe spot.
[02:35:27.780 --> 02:35:29.380]   Just be sure it'll be bad for teens.
[02:35:29.380 --> 02:35:30.380]   That's all.
[02:35:30.380 --> 02:35:32.380]   It'll be more immersive for now.
[02:35:32.380 --> 02:35:34.700]   No, we could talk a whole other hour.
[02:35:34.700 --> 02:35:39.940]   I don't want if I had I'm so glad my kids are grown 30 and 27 because I don't know
[02:35:39.940 --> 02:35:42.420]   what I would do if I had young kids these days.
[02:35:42.420 --> 02:35:44.620]   I don't know how you guys do it, but you're good parents.
[02:35:44.620 --> 02:35:46.020]   Well, we left out with the one we have.
[02:35:46.020 --> 02:35:47.380]   Yeah, that helps a lot.
[02:35:47.380 --> 02:35:48.380]   Check it.
[02:35:48.380 --> 02:35:49.380]   Yeah.
[02:35:49.380 --> 02:35:50.380]   It's adorable.
[02:35:50.380 --> 02:35:51.380]   Adores.
[02:35:51.380 --> 02:35:53.940]   I'd like to think you'd be a regular reader of Connect Safely Glue.
[02:35:53.940 --> 02:35:55.820]   Yeah, I'm sure Lisa does it all right.
[02:35:55.820 --> 02:35:59.500]   You've got quick guides there, educator guides, parent guides.
[02:35:59.500 --> 02:36:02.460]   Also in Spanish, lots of information.
[02:36:02.460 --> 02:36:03.660]   I think you do it really well for you.
[02:36:03.660 --> 02:36:05.860]   We do have a guide for online safety for seniors.
[02:36:05.860 --> 02:36:06.860]   So don't feel.
[02:36:06.860 --> 02:36:07.860]   Oh, thank you.
[02:36:07.860 --> 02:36:08.860]   I appreciate that.
[02:36:08.860 --> 02:36:12.540]   Hey, can you tell me how to use my Apple Watch?
[02:36:12.540 --> 02:36:16.220]   I can't figure it out.
[02:36:16.220 --> 02:36:17.220]   Thank you, Larry.
[02:36:17.220 --> 02:36:18.540]   Always great to see you.
[02:36:18.540 --> 02:36:19.540]   My pleasure.
[02:36:19.540 --> 02:36:20.540]   I like the new look.
[02:36:20.540 --> 02:36:22.540]   You do look about 20 years long younger.
[02:36:22.540 --> 02:36:23.540]   You look fantastic.
[02:36:23.540 --> 02:36:25.580]   You got your hair shortened a little bit.
[02:36:25.580 --> 02:36:26.580]   No more mustache.
[02:36:26.580 --> 02:36:28.380]   Well, go ahead and buy a workshop.
[02:36:28.380 --> 02:36:29.380]   Yeah.
[02:36:29.380 --> 02:36:30.380]   You look great.
[02:36:30.380 --> 02:36:31.380]   You look great.
[02:36:31.380 --> 02:36:32.380]   Yeah.
[02:36:32.380 --> 02:36:33.780]   It was great to see you.
[02:36:33.780 --> 02:36:37.780]   And Shelley, boy, it's great to finally meet you and have you on a show.
[02:36:37.780 --> 02:36:39.420]   Please come back again and again.
[02:36:39.420 --> 02:36:40.420]   You are fantastic.
[02:36:40.420 --> 02:36:42.020]   Oh, thanks, Leo.
[02:36:42.020 --> 02:36:43.020]   It was my pleasure.
[02:36:43.020 --> 02:36:44.780]   I really had a good time.
[02:36:44.780 --> 02:36:47.580]   Producer and reporter at Texas Standard.
[02:36:47.580 --> 02:36:51.260]   Texas Standard.org because it's a nonprofit.
[02:36:51.260 --> 02:36:53.140]   Radio show all about Texas.
[02:36:53.140 --> 02:36:57.940]   And of course, at sixcolors.com and you've got a great show on relay.fm.
[02:36:57.940 --> 02:37:01.860]   All about old movies.
[02:37:01.860 --> 02:37:03.260]   May I plug my book as well?
[02:37:03.260 --> 02:37:04.260]   Oh, just for fun.
[02:37:04.260 --> 02:37:06.260]   The new one is coming out when?
[02:37:06.260 --> 02:37:07.860]   The new one probably early November.
[02:37:07.860 --> 02:37:09.700]   This is the iOS 16 version.
[02:37:09.700 --> 02:37:13.980]   It's called iOS Access for All over at iOS Accessbook.com.
[02:37:13.980 --> 02:37:20.220]   And it covers all of the accessibility features in iOS in an exhaustive way.
[02:37:20.220 --> 02:37:21.980]   It's pretty comprehensive.
[02:37:21.980 --> 02:37:26.780]   And the deal I offer is that if you buy the book after Apple has released iOS 16, which
[02:37:26.780 --> 02:37:32.140]   they did very recently, then you will get a free copy of the iOS 16 version when it's
[02:37:32.140 --> 02:37:33.140]   released.
[02:37:33.140 --> 02:37:37.060]   So you get an old book now, but a new book will come to you for free when it's available.
[02:37:37.060 --> 02:37:41.020]   So buy the iOS 15 book now because a lot of that stuff is still good and then you'll
[02:37:41.020 --> 02:37:42.860]   get the new one that's ready.
[02:37:42.860 --> 02:37:44.780]   That's actually a very good idea.
[02:37:44.780 --> 02:37:48.420]   And do you have braille editions or you have audio books?
[02:37:48.420 --> 02:37:50.140]   It's EPUB or PDF.
[02:37:50.140 --> 02:37:52.180]   People have asked me for both of those things.
[02:37:52.180 --> 02:37:54.820]   And braille is very time consuming.
[02:37:54.820 --> 02:37:58.600]   The audio is just fun because I can imagine myself sitting in my little podcast closet
[02:37:58.600 --> 02:38:00.020]   reading for hours and hours.
[02:38:00.020 --> 02:38:05.540]   But no, EPUB, which is a very accessible format, PDF, which I make accessible, but is less
[02:38:05.540 --> 02:38:06.540]   accessible than EPUB.
[02:38:06.540 --> 02:38:11.580]   So if you want the absolute best accessible format and it works on devices that are specifically
[02:38:11.580 --> 02:38:15.900]   intended for blind folks like the Victor Reader Stream, it's a daisy compatible format.
[02:38:15.900 --> 02:38:18.780]   So EPUB will fit your accessibility needs.
[02:38:18.780 --> 02:38:19.780]   Perfect.
[02:38:19.780 --> 02:38:20.780]   Hopefully.
[02:38:20.780 --> 02:38:21.780]   I bet those voices are getting better.
[02:38:21.780 --> 02:38:24.580]   Pretty soon you're going to have James Earl Jones reading to you.
[02:38:24.580 --> 02:38:25.580]   Right.
[02:38:25.580 --> 02:38:27.740]   Thank you, Shelley.
[02:38:27.740 --> 02:38:29.820]   Great to have you.
[02:38:29.820 --> 02:38:30.820]   Keep up the good work.
[02:38:30.820 --> 02:38:31.980]   All three of you.
[02:38:31.980 --> 02:38:38.380]   We do Twitch Sunday afternoons about 2 p.m. Pacific, 5 p.m. Eastern 2100 UTC.
[02:38:38.380 --> 02:38:42.100]   If you're really in a hurry, you can watch us do it live at live.twit.tv.
[02:38:42.100 --> 02:38:47.580]   And if you're watching live, please chat with us in the chatroom, IRC.twit.tv.
[02:38:47.580 --> 02:38:52.300]   After the fact, we make on-demand versions of all of our shows available at twit.tv,
[02:38:52.300 --> 02:38:56.940]   the website, or on YouTube, there's a dedicated channel for every show.
[02:38:56.940 --> 02:39:02.220]   That's a good way to share clips from the show as long as YouTube doesn't take a town.
[02:39:02.220 --> 02:39:03.580]   Fingers crossed.
[02:39:03.580 --> 02:39:08.500]   And we also have, of course, it's a podcast on-demand versions you can subscribe to in
[02:39:08.500 --> 02:39:11.740]   your favorite podcast player and you'll get it that way automatically.
[02:39:11.740 --> 02:39:14.860]   Just in time for your Monday morning commute.
[02:39:14.860 --> 02:39:18.900]   We also invite you to take a look at club, but twit.
[02:39:18.900 --> 02:39:23.860]   An ad-free version of all of our shows, club twit is $7 a month, but I think it's a good
[02:39:23.860 --> 02:39:24.860]   deal.
[02:39:24.860 --> 02:39:29.140]   Not only you get ad-free versions of all the shows, you get access to the Discord.
[02:39:29.140 --> 02:39:34.780]   Our club twit Discord is a really great place to hang out.
[02:39:34.780 --> 02:39:40.620]   I feel like it's more than just a chatroom about our shows.
[02:39:40.620 --> 02:39:48.460]   It's chatting about everything going on in the world, from coding to cooking to photography
[02:39:48.460 --> 02:39:54.860]   to ham radio and hardware, even travel, space and sport ball.
[02:39:54.860 --> 02:39:56.380]   It's all in there.
[02:39:56.380 --> 02:40:00.860]   Plus from time to time, I'll play a video game on the stream there.
[02:40:00.860 --> 02:40:04.700]   We've been playing Satisfactory lately, which is a lot of fun.
[02:40:04.700 --> 02:40:07.260]   And we have our own Minecraft servers and so forth.
[02:40:07.260 --> 02:40:09.340]   So it's really a great community.
[02:40:09.340 --> 02:40:12.820]   You also get access to the twit plus feed, which is a lot of content that doesn't make
[02:40:12.820 --> 02:40:17.940]   it to the podcast, including shows that we don't put out in public because the club pays
[02:40:17.940 --> 02:40:19.620]   for them in effect.
[02:40:19.620 --> 02:40:24.460]   Brand new shows like Hands on Mac with Michael Sargent, Hands on Windows with Paul Thorett,
