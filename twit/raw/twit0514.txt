[00:02:22.840 --> 00:02:24.880]   Hey Harry McCracken, technologyizer guy.
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:26.040]   Nice to see you.
[00:02:26.040 --> 00:02:26.960]   Great to be here.
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:29.800]   Welcome fastcompany.com.
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:32.480]   And hey, Patrick Norton, you were here yesterday.
[00:02:32.480 --> 00:02:33.000]   It was.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   And you came back.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:34.520]   I did.
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:35.320]   I love that.
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.040]   Thank you.
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:40.640]   Patrick of course is at thetechthing.com, T-K-T-H-I-N-G.com.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:41.200]   Yes, I am.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.160]   And if you didn't see yesterday's the new screensaver, you were great on that.
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:45.960]   It was fun doing that with you again.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:47.360]   It's kind of like old times.
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.120]   Should I get my pants on though?
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:50.600]   Just like old times.
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:52.360]   Where's your kill?
[00:02:52.360 --> 00:02:53.280]   Somewhere.
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.240]   Do you still have kilts?
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:54.720]   Yes.
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.680]   Now that your father?
[00:02:55.680 --> 00:02:56.240]   Mm-hmm.
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:58.440]   OK, because I think you should wear a kill next time.
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:02:59.400]   We'll talk about it.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:00.200]   I like the kilts.
[00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.080]   I'll tell you what, if you wear it, I'll wear it.
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:05.120]   You're famous for the kilts and the sledgehammer.
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:05.640]   Yes.
[00:03:05.640 --> 00:03:08.560]   You have to carry that with burden with you for the till your day you die.
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:13.360]   Just looking forward to the day my oldest son finds that out.
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:14.680]   Dylan 20 is also here.
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.840]   He is editor at large at Venture Beat, formerly of Wired.
[00:03:17.840 --> 00:03:19.440]   It's good to see you, Dylan.
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:20.360]   It's great to be here.
[00:03:20.360 --> 00:03:24.000]   Back from camping with a Cub Scouts.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:26.080]   I presume you have a Cub Scout.
[00:03:26.080 --> 00:03:28.880]   Yes, there is actually a Cub Scout in my family.
[00:03:28.880 --> 00:03:29.400]   Good.
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:31.000]   You're not like the creepy neighbor that volunteers.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.680]   You actually have a Cub Scout.
[00:03:33.680 --> 00:03:34.480]   That's nice.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:35.440]   I was a Cub Scouts.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:39.480]   I'll have to find that picture of me doing the old Cub Scout salute.
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:43.280]   And lo and behold, look at this hot dogs ladies you bet.
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:45.280]   Merlin Mann is back.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.080]   Halleo, how are you?
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:48.480]   Apparently he does nothing but tweet.
[00:03:48.480 --> 00:03:48.960]   Me?
[00:03:48.960 --> 00:03:49.960]   Yeah.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:50.960]   Well, it's Cub Scout too.
[00:03:50.960 --> 00:03:52.200]   I was a permanent Bobcat.
[00:03:52.200 --> 00:03:55.200]   Oh, that was always a problem.
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:03:56.000]   Love to see you.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:01.160]   Hey, it's great that you guys did a revival of You Look Nice today.
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.160]   Yeah, it was super fun.
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.440]   It's-- I missed those guys.
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:05.080]   They're getting pretty old though.
[00:04:05.080 --> 00:04:06.840]   Lonely sandwich.
[00:04:06.840 --> 00:04:07.280]   Yep.
[00:04:07.280 --> 00:04:12.440]   Adam Lusagor and Scott, who used to work at the Fruit Company.
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:13.280]   Yeah, the paper company.
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:15.040]   He used to have a high position there.
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:15.540]   Yeah.
[00:04:15.540 --> 00:04:16.520]   It's been a crazy week here.
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:19.520]   There's just been so much going on for the last week around WWDC.
[00:04:19.520 --> 00:04:22.920]   And so many other events related, different conferences.
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:24.800]   And it's been a great week.
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:26.360]   Well, we have a lot to talk about.
[00:04:26.360 --> 00:04:27.080]   That's for sure.
[00:04:27.080 --> 00:04:28.200]   Let's start with Monday.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:33.920]   And WWDC, the World Wide Developers Conference.
[00:04:33.920 --> 00:04:37.840]   Apple had, in my opinion, kind of a fragmented talk.
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:39.440]   Lots of different stuff.
[00:04:39.440 --> 00:04:41.800]   Of course, you're talking to developers.
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.840]   Although it's a little weird because this
[00:04:43.840 --> 00:04:46.320]   is one of only three kind of big public events
[00:04:46.320 --> 00:04:46.960]   that Apple has.
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:49.080]   So it can't just be for developers.
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:51.560]   People are paying attention as we were.
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.640]   They did announce iOS 9, which will come out this fall.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:55.640]   And some new features there.
[00:04:55.640 --> 00:05:00.000]   They announced Mac OS 10, 10.11 El Capitan.
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:01.760]   Yes, Mon Capitan.
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:03.560]   Mon Capitan would have been better.
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:05.880]   I like that.
[00:05:05.880 --> 00:05:07.320]   Mon Capitan.
[00:05:07.320 --> 00:05:10.000]   And they talked-- and they, for the first time,
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:12.160]   they named the operating system for the Apple Watch.
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:15.320]   It's called WatchOS.
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:17.080]   Harry, you thoughts?
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:21.280]   Well, if you were expecting surprises or great leaps
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:23.160]   forward, it was a disappointment, partially
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.160]   because almost everything was leaked.
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:26.960]   I think in just in terms of useful stuff that
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.840]   might make your life better, it was not a bad event.
[00:05:29.840 --> 00:05:33.080]   It was pretty dense with new features on the various platforms.
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:36.480]   The WatchOS stuff means that for the first time,
[00:05:36.480 --> 00:05:38.680]   Apple watches will actually be able to run apps, which
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.480]   is a big deal.
[00:05:39.480 --> 00:05:40.560]   Thank you, guys.
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.040]   At this point, the Apple Watch to me
[00:05:42.040 --> 00:05:45.080]   is kind of a gadget that doesn't have a whole lot of utility.
[00:05:45.080 --> 00:05:47.000]   Although I talked to a blind guy on the radio show,
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   and he said, you know, don't-- for the blind community,
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.280]   this is great because it's a talking watch.
[00:05:52.280 --> 00:05:53.200]   You could turn our voice over.
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.440]   It'll talk.
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:56.360]   Somebody said, I was sitting next to a guy on the bus.
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:05:57.920]   He asked his watch, where are we now?
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:58.720]   What stop is this?
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:00.360]   And the watch told him.
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:02.000]   So there's a lot of value for that.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:04.160]   But for the normal-- I want to say normal.
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.520]   But for the vast majority of us, it's just a gadget.
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:10.680]   I think it will get way better quite quickly
[00:06:10.680 --> 00:06:12.640]   once developers have access to stuff
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:15.840]   like the digital crown and all the sensors.
[00:06:15.840 --> 00:06:16.480]   That was great.
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:18.760]   The other thing I thought was interesting personally
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:21.960]   was the iPad is looking more and more like a PC operating
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:22.440]   system.
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:22.960]   Yes.
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:25.840]   I've been asking for multiple apps on screen at once.
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:26.960]   You're finally getting that.
[00:06:26.960 --> 00:06:29.160]   And I think it is not unreasonable to assume
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.560]   that we will see future devices running iOS
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:34.240]   to start to look a little bit more like a PC,
[00:06:34.240 --> 00:06:35.640]   whether it's a larger screen.
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:36.880]   Merlin, do you like that idea?
[00:06:36.880 --> 00:06:41.520]   Do you have the ability to do two windows on an iPad?
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:42.680]   Yeah, I do.
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:44.640]   I have an iPad Air 2.
[00:06:44.640 --> 00:06:49.000]   And as I sit here today, I think that maybe next to my SC30,
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:51.320]   I had in the early '90s, it might be my favorite Apple
[00:06:51.320 --> 00:06:52.920]   device ever.
[00:06:52.920 --> 00:06:53.760]   I mean, I love my iPhone.
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.600]   But the iPad Air 2, you really get
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:06:58.720]   the power of what that thing can do.
[00:06:58.720 --> 00:07:00.200]   And I'm really looking forward.
[00:07:00.200 --> 00:07:01.880]   In fact, I'm not one of those guys who
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:03.280]   run around doing betas anymore.
[00:07:03.280 --> 00:07:05.440]   But even just watching the keynote
[00:07:05.440 --> 00:07:06.840]   and seeing the picture in picture,
[00:07:06.840 --> 00:07:09.000]   I immediately feel like an animal having to watch something
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.400]   on YouTube in a victory screen.
[00:07:11.400 --> 00:07:12.720]   And it feels like the 1930s.
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:14.760]   I'm like, come on, I can't get this fast enough.
[00:07:14.760 --> 00:07:15.840]   But I think it's really exciting.
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:18.760]   I think the OS 10 stability and the iOS announcements
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.640]   were, for me, the two most interesting things.
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:22.800]   Isn't there a risk still in the way
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.360]   of making the iPad too complicated?
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.560]   Yeah, I was just thinking that.
[00:07:26.560 --> 00:07:30.280]   I mean, on the one hand, you've got features
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:34.280]   like the split screen view, which Windows has had for years.
[00:07:34.280 --> 00:07:37.200]   And Apple's like, hey, look, we invented--
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:39.000]   you can look at you after one time.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:39.800]   Wow.
[00:07:39.800 --> 00:07:41.320]   And the rest of the world is like, huh-huh.
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:42.760]   You mean like on my Note 4?
[00:07:42.760 --> 00:07:43.320]   Oh.
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:45.080]   Well, it has a user base on tablets.
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:46.640]   It's a little larger.
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:48.960]   But I mean, the thing is, one of the things,
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:51.120]   I think, that is appealing about the iPad
[00:07:51.120 --> 00:07:53.240]   and the whole tablet interfaces that is very focused.
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.040]   It's like one thing at a time.
[00:07:55.040 --> 00:07:59.120]   And they have up till now struck a very good balance
[00:07:59.120 --> 00:08:02.720]   between that sort of extreme simplicity
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:05.600]   and the usability that that engenders.
[00:08:05.600 --> 00:08:08.160]   I just wonder, as it gets more and more PC-like,
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:11.800]   is it going to become more PC-like and usability too?
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:13.520]   Yeah.
[00:08:13.520 --> 00:08:15.920]   Is it, as Neil deGrasse Tyson said,
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:19.960]   a watershed moment in civilization?
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:22.120]   So what happened there?
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.640]   He was actually in a video.
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:28.000]   So Neil deGrasse Tyson, world famous astrophysicist,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.560]   host of Cosmos, director of the Hayden Planetarium in New York.
[00:08:31.560 --> 00:08:32.600]   Like he's an awesome guy.
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:34.760]   He's a hero to many of us, right?
[00:08:34.760 --> 00:08:35.760]   Yeah.
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:39.160]   But he had a little cameo in a video about the App Store
[00:08:39.160 --> 00:08:43.200]   where he said, "App's plus hardware is a water--
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.640]   App's plus handheld hardware is a watershed moment
[00:08:45.640 --> 00:08:46.360]   in civilization."
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:47.960]   You know when Neil says it though, you go, yeah,
[00:08:47.960 --> 00:08:49.160]   I think he's right.
[00:08:49.160 --> 00:08:50.160]   Well, right.
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:51.480]   I was like, wait a minute.
[00:08:51.480 --> 00:08:53.960]   Did he really just say that about the App Store?
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.520]   So I called him up and asked him about that.
[00:08:56.520 --> 00:08:58.560]   And he yelled at me for like 20 minutes.
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:08:58.960]   What?
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:00.680]   He was like, listen to my words.
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:02.520]   I did not say the App Store.
[00:09:02.520 --> 00:09:06.240]   I said handheld devices plus apps.
[00:09:06.240 --> 00:09:08.560]   He never mentioned Apple, and he never mentioned the App Store.
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:11.560]   And it turns out that Apple interviewed him
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:12.720]   for like 45 minutes.
[00:09:12.720 --> 00:09:16.240]   He spent the entire time raving about hardware in general
[00:09:16.240 --> 00:09:18.840]   and the kind of sensors that are in smartphones
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.720]   and how that enables people to be scientists and connected
[00:09:21.720 --> 00:09:23.840]   to the internet, gives you all this information.
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:27.400]   And like the one second that he mentions the App Store,
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:30.080]   that's the clip that they pull out and put into their video
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:30.800]   about the App Store.
[00:09:30.800 --> 00:09:32.600]   So it sounds like he's saying the App Store
[00:09:32.600 --> 00:09:35.240]   is a watershed moment, but he really meant, you know,
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:38.560]   this whole like tiny computer and all of the internet.
[00:09:38.560 --> 00:09:40.840]   And the palm of your hand is a watershed moment.
[00:09:40.840 --> 00:09:42.840]   Do you think he yelled at Apple like he yelled at you?
[00:09:42.840 --> 00:09:44.320]   [LAUGHS]
[00:09:44.320 --> 00:09:45.840]   I hope so.
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:47.400]   They paid him, he told me.
[00:09:47.400 --> 00:09:49.240]   So I, you know, he probably cast the check
[00:09:49.240 --> 00:09:50.880]   and like shake his head and went out his way.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:56.200]   But yeah, he was real concerned that we get that right.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.720]   And this, my friends, is why even if Apple asked,
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:01.520]   I wouldn't accept a check for talking to them on camera
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:03.280]   at the App Store.
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.320]   It's not that they've ever asked.
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:07.440]   It reminded me of an event I went too long ago
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:10.240]   that Intel put on for the Centrino chip, which they hired
[00:10:10.240 --> 00:10:11.680]   Malcolm Gladwell for.
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:14.040]   And Malcolm Gladwell said that maybe Centrino
[00:10:14.040 --> 00:10:16.200]   will be a tipping point for the world.
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:16.640]   Oh Lord.
[00:10:16.640 --> 00:10:21.760]   Because it puts Wi-Fi on the same platform as the CPU.
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:24.240]   At least he got a plug-in for the book.
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.920]   That's what Neil missed.
[00:10:25.920 --> 00:10:28.680]   In the cosmos, this is a watershed moment.
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:29.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:32.120]   Then maybe it'd be worth--
[00:10:32.120 --> 00:10:33.960]   No, there's also the side problem.
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:38.120]   Anytime Apple writes a check, they only give you 70%.
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:42.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.120]   You know, it actually was a decent presentation.
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:47.160]   I don't know why they spent so much time.
[00:10:47.160 --> 00:10:47.760]   They do this.
[00:10:47.760 --> 00:10:49.400]   They're wanting to do this on the Note--
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:51.000]   they did notepad app.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.400]   Like that's a big deal.
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:55.360]   They did-- I remember they did that with a card store.
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:57.400]   Remember, they had a card app.
[00:10:57.400 --> 00:11:00.000]   And they spent like 10 minutes talking about it.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.280]   And then they killed it like a year later.
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:04.400]   So they want to do that.
[00:11:04.400 --> 00:11:05.520]   I guess they get excited.
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.000]   You know, this is going to be a big deal.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.680]   You're going to have a to-do list in your notepad, whatever.
[00:11:09.680 --> 00:11:12.480]   But then the thing really went off the rails.
[00:11:12.480 --> 00:11:14.880]   Jimmy Iovine walks out.
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:18.160]   And I feel like it's a New Jersey moment between Eddie
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.360]   Q and Jimmy Iovine.
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.200]   I feel like the East Coast is--
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:22.200]   And everybody looks at me.
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:22.640]   Everybody looks at me.
[00:11:22.640 --> 00:11:23.640]   And everybody looks at me.
[00:11:23.640 --> 00:11:24.640]   And everybody looks at me.
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:25.280]   Oh boy.
[00:11:25.280 --> 00:11:28.320]   Eddie was dancing in his pink shirt to some given music.
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:30.920]   He looked-- yeah, he was having a good time.
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:33.440]   I actually rolled my sleeves up just like him.
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:34.680]   Only one, right?
[00:11:34.680 --> 00:11:36.400]   You don't want to go too far.
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:40.400]   And I opened an extra button, just an honor at him.
[00:11:40.400 --> 00:11:41.400]   You were there, right?
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:42.120]   I was there in person.
[00:11:42.120 --> 00:11:45.680]   What was the feeling in the room when Iovine?
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:49.560]   Were people worried that he was kind of losing it?
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:52.600]   Well, I think Apple of M.C. Days are almost more
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:56.160]   fun than the old days just because more weird stuff goes on.
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.400]   You can see people actually having fun on stage.
[00:11:59.400 --> 00:12:01.240]   And they had-- who knows how many people
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:03.080]   trying to explain Apple music?
[00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:04.080]   Drake came out?
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:05.920]   And none of them actually succeeded.
[00:12:05.920 --> 00:12:09.480]   I know that Apple music is an upgrade to Beats music,
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:10.880]   which is not a bad app.
[00:12:10.880 --> 00:12:13.960]   And I know that Apple is doing a radio station.
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:16.240]   And I know that they're saying that human curation is better
[00:12:16.240 --> 00:12:17.960]   than an algorithm.
[00:12:17.960 --> 00:12:19.760]   But it's still not clear how Apple music
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:22.440]   is going to come into this category that is crowded
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:25.160]   with streaming music apps and be something all that compelling.
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:26.440]   Well, the pricing is good.
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:27.880]   That's almost the thing I found that people--
[00:12:27.880 --> 00:12:29.080]   The family plan.
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:31.360]   But you know that Spotify and everybody else
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:34.160]   are going to come up with a similar $15.99 for six people
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:34.480]   plan.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.320]   I mean, that's why wouldn't they?
[00:12:36.320 --> 00:12:37.840]   Music industry says yes to Apple.
[00:12:37.840 --> 00:12:39.920]   They're going to do the same thing.
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.600]   In fact, Spotify, there it is on the verge.
[00:12:41.600 --> 00:12:43.240]   I don't know if the verged--
[00:12:43.240 --> 00:12:46.400]   this is not a scoop exactly because they didn't get confirmation.
[00:12:46.400 --> 00:12:49.000]   But they say the Spotify does plan to match that 15.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.080]   They pretty much have to.
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:51.280]   Well, these Spotify also just raised--
[00:12:51.280 --> 00:12:51.680]   Yeah, they're not.
[00:12:51.680 --> 00:12:52.200]   Right.
[00:12:52.200 --> 00:12:54.800]   They raised like $1/2 billion.
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:56.320]   There's-- I mean, it's interesting also,
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.040]   as this is going on, all of the lawsuits
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:12:59.680]   are starting to come out about whether or not--
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:01.000]   or the investigations, but whether or not
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:04.400]   Apple was coercing music labels into trying
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:06.600]   to remove free streaming and other platforms.
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:07.920]   Apple's spending money.
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:09.680]   Apple's so desperate to get into this market.
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:12.600]   I don't think it was as tone deaf as the title announcement
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:14.200]   because there was something sad about seeing
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:14.800]   some of the riches--
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:16.680]   Which Jay Z brought all these people out.
[00:13:16.680 --> 00:13:18.640]   We're not making enough money off of streaming music.
[00:13:18.640 --> 00:13:20.600]   Then your lawyer should have done a better job
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:21.600]   with the record on this.
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:22.640]   Then they signed a weird document,
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:24.240]   which nobody told them what it was,
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:26.640]   but they all signed it for some reason.
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.520]   And Lady Madonna-- I don't know why I call her Lady Madonna--
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:32.640]   Lady Madonna put her foot up on the table while she signed it.
[00:13:32.640 --> 00:13:33.640]   Or was that Lady Gaga?
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:34.080]   I don't know.
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:35.960]   One of them did that.
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:37.280]   Yeah, that was weird.
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:39.720]   But this reminded me, this thing at the end
[00:13:39.720 --> 00:13:42.280]   of the normal Apple event, did remind me
[00:13:42.280 --> 00:13:45.440]   a little bit of a Samsung event, kind of singing and dancing.
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:46.760]   There she is.
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:48.720]   What is that all about?
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:49.600]   Thank you, Madonna.
[00:13:49.600 --> 00:13:53.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:55.640]   Interesting point of view from a Pando Daily--
[00:13:55.640 --> 00:13:57.480]   David Holmes running a Pando Daily.
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:00.000]   He says, is Spotify doing because of Apple Music?
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.040]   No, Spotify has been doomed from the start.
[00:14:02.040 --> 00:14:04.760]   We kind of focus on, can Apple Music beat Spotify?
[00:14:04.760 --> 00:14:06.680]   But the real question is, is there a future at all
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:08.640]   for these streaming apps?
[00:14:08.640 --> 00:14:11.440]   Because the music industry hates them.
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:13.520]   Right?
[00:14:13.520 --> 00:14:16.120]   You think it's the music industry that artists hate
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:17.720]   should hate the music industry instead of some nasty--
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.640]   Well, you think you think they're getting a better deal
[00:14:19.640 --> 00:14:21.360]   from Apple than they got from--
[00:14:21.360 --> 00:14:23.640]   I mean, it just doesn't--
[00:14:23.640 --> 00:14:24.800]   the economics don't add up.
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:27.520]   If you're paying $10 a month, Apple's not
[00:14:27.520 --> 00:14:30.680]   going to have that much more to give the artists than Spotify
[00:14:30.680 --> 00:14:30.840]   is.
[00:14:30.840 --> 00:14:31.880]   That's exactly how that's all about.
[00:14:31.880 --> 00:14:32.960]   Apple can spend more money.
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:34.120]   I mean, if they want to--
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:35.200]   They could just subsidize it.
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:37.280]   Well, yeah, this would be like a classic proctor
[00:14:37.280 --> 00:14:38.280]   and gamble movement.
[00:14:38.280 --> 00:14:40.480]   We're going to go in and make the cheapest detergent on the planet.
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.040]   We're going to put everybody else out of business.
[00:14:42.040 --> 00:14:43.520]   Then we're going to put a premium brand in
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:44.920]   and eliminate the cheap detergent.
[00:14:44.920 --> 00:14:49.400]   I mean, that was kind of their thing for decades.
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:51.360]   But Apple could be doing that.
[00:14:51.360 --> 00:14:55.440]   Or maybe Apple's just desperate to stay relevant.
[00:14:55.440 --> 00:14:58.160]   There's this funny scenario that the music industry finally
[00:14:58.160 --> 00:15:01.760]   met somebody that was more of a shark than they were.
[00:15:01.760 --> 00:15:04.120]   There's a quote in this Panda Daily story
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.280]   from an unnamed music industry source-- actually,
[00:15:06.280 --> 00:15:07.600]   it's from The Verge--
[00:15:07.600 --> 00:15:10.440]   all the way up to Tim Cook, these guys is cutthroat.
[00:15:10.440 --> 00:15:13.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:15:13.320 --> 00:15:15.360]   But when Jimmy Iaveen takes a stage,
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:19.720]   he seems a little more street smart, a little more tough.
[00:15:19.720 --> 00:15:21.480]   Maybe that's just his persona.
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:23.400]   He, from the very beginning of Beats,
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:25.920]   but along before Apple came along, said,
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:29.320]   we got the thing that's going to save the music industry
[00:15:29.320 --> 00:15:31.360]   or streaming music as human curation.
[00:15:31.360 --> 00:15:32.320]   Right.
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.560]   It'll be interesting to see how well it scales.
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.720]   It makes a lot of sense if you're talking about a few songs
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:39.760]   and a fairly small number of people.
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:43.000]   But if they're doing this on Apple's scale,
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.280]   and they're trying to appeal to people with all sorts
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:48.200]   of different tastes in music, how many human curators
[00:15:48.200 --> 00:15:49.400]   do they need to do that?
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:51.360]   And how do they keep it interesting a year from now?
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:52.520]   Is the playlist I like now?
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:55.200]   I won't care about a year from now.
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:57.480]   I mean, it's not like human curation is untried.
[00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:00.280]   We still have FM radio, and that's curated.
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:01.200]   That's what cracked me up.
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:06.400]   Apple announced this is Beats 1 24/7 Global Radio Station.
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:08.720]   This was an innovation.
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:09.720]   Don't we have radio?
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:11.960]   Radial is a powerful force in the universe.
[00:16:11.960 --> 00:16:12.960]   It's a very silica-palley.
[00:16:12.960 --> 00:16:15.600]   I invented radio on the internet.
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:19.440]   My theory is that there is still a reality distortion field
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:22.680]   at Apple, but it only applies within the executive suite.
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.680]   They're the only ones fooled.
[00:16:24.680 --> 00:16:26.640]   Merlin, do you listen to--
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:28.640]   what do you seem like a music guy?
[00:16:28.640 --> 00:16:29.480]   Like you like music?
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:30.000]   I am.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:31.400]   What do you use?
[00:16:31.400 --> 00:16:33.840]   I have a-- I really like iTunes Match.
[00:16:33.840 --> 00:16:35.800]   That's been good to me.
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:39.040]   And I've subscribed to Beats for some time.
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:39.720]   Oh, really?
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:43.200]   So you like-- do you prefer it to any of the other choices?
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:44.120]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:45.400]   There's a time when I've tried the other ones.
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:46.680]   I've tried Spotify for a while.
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:48.800]   I just-- Beats made sense to me.
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:50.040]   I like the way it works.
[00:16:50.040 --> 00:16:52.600]   I wish it would keep me logged in longer.
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:55.960]   I have a-- I mean, I don't have that much about the streaming
[00:16:55.960 --> 00:16:59.280]   music business, but I have a theory that I share with a few
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:03.080]   other people that it kind of feels like--
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:03.440]   I don't know.
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.200]   I felt like the first two thirds, or however long,
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.760]   of this was a pretty good show.
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:10.760]   I mean, you know, it was-- there was not any of the giant
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:11.440]   dangers.
[00:17:11.440 --> 00:17:11.880]   Yeah.
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:14.120]   Yeah, but the music part felt--
[00:17:14.120 --> 00:17:16.000]   and I don't mean to sound critical or pile on,
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.760]   but it really-- it was a something show.
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:19.880]   It was a mess.
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:21.040]   And it really felt unrehearsed.
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.640]   It felt not ready.
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:28.080]   It felt really-- I enjoy the kind of unrehearsed moments.
[00:17:28.080 --> 00:17:29.040]   But I don't know.
[00:17:29.040 --> 00:17:30.640]   I share the theory with a few other people
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:33.520]   that it kind of feels weird to end, first of all,
[00:17:33.520 --> 00:17:37.080]   to invoke the semi-sacred one more thing
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.640]   to announce a consumer-facing service that has zero
[00:17:39.640 --> 00:17:40.720]   to do with developers.
[00:17:40.720 --> 00:17:41.160]   Yeah.
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.960]   And there's this part of me that wonders if maybe they were
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.800]   like this close on something like an Apple TV announcement,
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:47.240]   and it just wasn't there yet.
[00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:52.600]   And I wonder if maybe this event, which was not a particularly
[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:54.800]   watershed event to call one more thing,
[00:17:54.800 --> 00:17:56.440]   is a part of me that just kind of wonders if maybe they
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:58.320]   had to put that in at the last minute,
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:00.320]   and that's what they had.
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:02.040]   I'm convinced that that happened.
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:06.600]   In fact, the fact that the home kit announcement was so short,
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.440]   and I know they had so much more to say,
[00:18:09.440 --> 00:18:12.360]   told me that that felt like that's where they would have said,
[00:18:12.360 --> 00:18:16.680]   oh, and by the way, the hub for your home kit will be the brand
[00:18:16.680 --> 00:18:19.480]   new Apple TV.
[00:18:19.480 --> 00:18:20.640]   But that's still to come.
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.840]   Apparently, if that was delayed, it's delayed
[00:18:22.840 --> 00:18:24.720]   because of deals that weren't made.
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:28.080]   But this is kind of the overall point of this,
[00:18:28.080 --> 00:18:29.760]   and the point of the Pando Daily article
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:32.920]   is that Apple's now going into areas like the music business,
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:36.200]   where they're bringing a knife to a gunfight.
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:40.400]   These guys, the music industry is going to eventually kill Pandora.
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:41.960]   They've been trying really hard.
[00:18:41.960 --> 00:18:43.400]   There's going to eventually kill Spotify.
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:44.120]   Now, it's suicide.
[00:18:44.120 --> 00:18:46.160]   It's stupid because there's no alternative
[00:18:46.160 --> 00:18:47.760]   the music industry is proposing.
[00:18:47.760 --> 00:18:50.920]   What they want is for you to go back and buy CDs some more.
[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:53.360]   I mean, they're going to kill Spotify by just raising the rates,
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:54.880]   and raising the rates, and raising the rates.
[00:18:54.880 --> 00:18:57.320]   Yeah, Spotify is not making money.
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.080]   Spotify is raising money.
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:01.720]   But Spotify is not profitable and never will be
[00:19:01.720 --> 00:19:05.560]   because the music industry determines how much money they make.
[00:19:05.560 --> 00:19:08.280]   They could have every person in the planet sign up.
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:11.520]   They still take home less than they spend.
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:13.600]   So how is that a business?
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:14.600]   Where does that flip?
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:17.640]   Their counting, I presume, they're counting as Tim Westergren
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:21.640]   at Pandora's counting on the music industry giving in,
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:24.320]   saying, OK, we'll take less.
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.760]   The music industry doesn't seem to have any will to do this.
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:29.680]   And Spotify is expanding to video and other stuff, too,
[00:19:29.680 --> 00:19:31.520]   so they don't have to have all their eggs in one basket.
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:35.520]   I should probably disclaim that we are one of the podcasts
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:36.200]   on Spotify.
[00:19:36.200 --> 00:19:38.720]   Our audio and video is on the new Spotify.
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:40.080]   And I'm thrilled about that.
[00:19:40.080 --> 00:19:43.440]   And that's a smart move because I don't charge them
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:45.520]   from putting Twitter on Pandora.
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:47.800]   I mean, on Spotify, that's free.
[00:19:47.800 --> 00:19:50.840]   People have said that one advantage Apple has
[00:19:50.840 --> 00:19:52.840]   is their massive clout, the fact that they're
[00:19:52.840 --> 00:19:55.600]   going to put beats on every single iOS device come
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:20:02.040]   the end of the month with 8.4, that they have a multi-billion dollar
[00:20:02.040 --> 00:20:03.400]   slush fund.
[00:20:03.400 --> 00:20:05.160]   They've already started buying ads like crazy.
[00:20:05.160 --> 00:20:07.040]   But have you seen the Apple music ads?
[00:20:07.040 --> 00:20:08.880]   They don't--
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:10.360]   I don't think that this--
[00:20:10.360 --> 00:20:12.160]   maybe there's going to be more to this campaign.
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:13.680]   They're great ads.
[00:20:13.680 --> 00:20:17.600]   This is the video they showed at the ad as well.
[00:20:17.600 --> 00:20:18.400]   Love the ads.
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:21.800]   It's kind of the history of music.
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:24.280]   But at no point does it talk about a product.
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:27.120]   It looks like, oh, brother, we're art thou light.
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:30.600]   In fact, all they say at the end is it says Apple music.
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:33.120]   And I think most people seeing that will say, oh, yeah,
[00:20:33.120 --> 00:20:33.880]   Apple music.
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:34.800]   I tuned, so I know that.
[00:20:34.800 --> 00:20:36.400]   I already-- yeah, I'm a big fan.
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:39.000]   I use it all the time.
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:41.600]   Merlin, maybe this is the beginning of a campaign
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:42.520]   that will do more.
[00:20:42.520 --> 00:20:47.240]   I don't know.
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:50.240]   There's a phrase, John Syracuse, from external tech podcast
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:51.560]   uses sometimes.
[00:20:51.560 --> 00:20:53.520]   You can really tell when a company is putting wood
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:54.600]   behind the arrow.
[00:20:54.600 --> 00:20:58.160]   And it's funny because there were several things that came up.
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:59.800]   You had mentioned-- what was the one you mentioned,
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:01.800]   like the Cards app a few years ago.
[00:21:01.800 --> 00:21:03.720]   It feels like sometimes Apple will have these things
[00:21:03.720 --> 00:21:06.480]   that they toss out that seem really just a little bit north
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:08.640]   of a trial balloon where you're like--
[00:21:08.640 --> 00:21:09.880]   This is not a trial balloon.
[00:21:09.880 --> 00:21:11.240]   This has to work.
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:11.740]   Right?
[00:21:11.740 --> 00:21:12.080]   I guess so.
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:12.560]   I guess so.
[00:21:12.560 --> 00:21:14.840]   But it just seems incredibly fragmented.
[00:21:14.840 --> 00:21:17.640]   It really feels like they got a box and put three things
[00:21:17.640 --> 00:21:18.840]   in it and called it a service.
[00:21:18.840 --> 00:21:20.480]   They got a-- it's a me too.
[00:21:20.480 --> 00:21:21.720]   But they showed-- I guess so.
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:24.160]   But I mean, I guess I'm saying that if you show the setup
[00:21:24.160 --> 00:21:25.560]   for setting the app up with a little bubbles--
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:25.920]   That's nice.
[00:21:25.920 --> 00:21:26.420]   Yep.
[00:21:26.420 --> 00:21:27.120]   That's beats.
[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:28.560]   That's setting up a beats account.
[00:21:28.560 --> 00:21:29.840]   You do exactly the same thing.
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:30.320]   There you go.
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:31.040]   That was the pitch.
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:31.320]   That was the pitch.
[00:21:31.320 --> 00:21:32.440]   2015 Apple music.
[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:33.440]   What?
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:34.240]   Yeah.
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:35.280]   So I don't know.
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:38.760]   I mean, I guess I just would have liked as a consumer who
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:40.760]   is super interested in this kind of stuff and does
[00:21:40.760 --> 00:21:42.440]   like music and doesn't mind paying for it.
[00:21:42.440 --> 00:21:44.800]   I wish there had been a little bit more clarity about what
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:46.560]   this was replacing.
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:49.720]   In the same way that, for example, I don't know,
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:51.920]   it just feels like they come up with these things that
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:53.480]   are partly baked.
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.680]   And they do enough to put some people out of business
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:58.600]   but don't really change fundamentally how things work.
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:01.320]   So reading list came along and heard a lot of later
[00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:01.800]   services.
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:02.920]   But I don't know that many people that love--
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:04.240]   Change anything, yeah.
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:05.880]   I don't know anybody that uses it.
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:07.600]   The Notes app stuff, I think those are great.
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:09.040]   Those are great additions.
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:11.960]   But in the case of stuff like that News app, it's like,
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:13.960]   I mean, is that going to be there a year from now?
[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:15.720]   I mean, I realize they kind of have to do that to compete
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:16.320]   with Facebook.
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:19.760]   But there are certain kinds of things where I would like to
[00:22:19.760 --> 00:22:21.440]   have a little more clarity on exactly what it's meant to
[00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:21.920]   replace.
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:23.960]   So is Newsstand really dead?
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:26.080]   I have friends that put out magazines for money that have
[00:22:26.080 --> 00:22:29.160]   not officially been told that yet, which seems really weird.
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:31.080]   That was the assumption is that they're going to get a
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:32.080]   little rid of it.
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.560]   But the Newsstand, which was kind of lame, which was kind of
[00:22:33.560 --> 00:22:39.640]   like a folder that is in the folder that holds publications,
[00:22:39.640 --> 00:22:41.200]   that's going to go away.
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:43.000]   But this news doesn't replace that.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:43.760]   This is something else.
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:45.800]   Well, you want as you want the magazines that used to be in
[00:22:45.800 --> 00:22:47.480]   that Newsstand folder just to be on the desk?
[00:22:47.480 --> 00:22:48.560]   Apparently that's what they're--
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:49.080]   The other stuff.
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:49.800]   That's what I've read it.
[00:22:49.800 --> 00:22:52.560]   But you saying that Apple, Merlin hasn't told anybody?
[00:22:52.560 --> 00:22:53.360]   Well, I can't say for sure.
[00:22:53.360 --> 00:22:56.200]   But actually this little podcast of "Do a Jim Dowrymple,"
[00:22:56.200 --> 00:22:58.720]   which will come out tomorrow, or this week's episode, he
[00:22:58.720 --> 00:23:01.440]   has something for Loop Insight on "Has a Magazine."
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:03.680]   And according to him, he hasn't received any kind of
[00:23:03.680 --> 00:23:05.600]   notification from Apple about that.
[00:23:05.600 --> 00:23:08.600]   It's just-- it's just-- you know, I don't know.
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:11.560]   There are just times when Apple comes up with stuff and
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:13.280]   you really kind of hope--
[00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:14.880]   sometimes it feels like a gamble with any company.
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:15.640]   This is true for Google.
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:17.080]   This is true for anywhere.
[00:23:17.080 --> 00:23:19.760]   But especially with Apple, you really hope that they're
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:21.640]   going to see it through to completion.
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:24.000]   And as they say, put that wood behind the arrow to make it
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.440]   something that's going to be really awesome.
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:27.600]   It's just that in the case of that music app, that smelled
[00:23:27.600 --> 00:23:29.320]   more like ping to me than--
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.240]   [INTERPOSING VOICES]
[00:23:30.240 --> 00:23:31.480]   I mean, well, no, in this sense--
[00:23:31.480 --> 00:23:32.000]   Yeah, I--
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:32.480]   Let me understand.
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:35.080]   So Drake's going to send me lyrics in the app where I
[00:23:35.080 --> 00:23:36.640]   listen to REM.
[00:23:36.640 --> 00:23:38.840]   This is-- the problem with stuff like iTunes is this is
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:40.240]   too much junk in one place.
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:43.640]   This feels like a different way of organizing that junk
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:45.320]   around Beats plus something.
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:46.960]   They did not clarify the iTunes match thing.
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:49.080]   iTunes match-- I think you still have to have a separate
[00:23:49.080 --> 00:23:51.560]   iTunes match account to keep using iTunes match, even
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:53.720]   though iTunes match selections appear.
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:54.160]   I don't know.
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:56.200]   I just thought it was pretty modeled.
[00:23:56.200 --> 00:23:57.920]   Dylan, you were going to say something.
[00:23:57.920 --> 00:23:59.640]   Yeah, iTunes is not going away either.
[00:23:59.640 --> 00:24:01.480]   They weren't very clear about that.
[00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:02.880]   Is match going away?
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:04.840]   Match continues.
[00:24:04.840 --> 00:24:05.720]   Yeah, I don't know.
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:08.360]   I mean, it feels to me like they had a checklist of things.
[00:24:08.360 --> 00:24:09.760]   Like, we need lyrics.
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:10.960]   We need curation.
[00:24:10.960 --> 00:24:14.240]   We need this and that.
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:15.880]   And they just kind of shook it up.
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:17.560]   It feels like a meat to--
[00:24:17.560 --> 00:24:20.400]   The problem is I don't see any--
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:22.840]   I don't know if there's friction to switch from Spotify.
[00:24:22.840 --> 00:24:25.400]   I'm a Spotify and Google Music subscriber.
[00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:27.240]   I jump around all the time.
[00:24:27.240 --> 00:24:27.800]   How hard is this?
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:28.440]   You just jump around.
[00:24:28.440 --> 00:24:31.080]   So that's not a hard thing to do, right?
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:33.920]   And because they're going to give people free three months,
[00:24:33.920 --> 00:24:34.760]   it's the same price.
[00:24:34.760 --> 00:24:36.600]   It's $10 a month.
[00:24:36.600 --> 00:24:39.240]   And I presume $30 million, the same $30 million
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:40.960]   sucks that everybody else has.
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:46.360]   So the selling point solely is-- but it's Apple.
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:49.920]   I mean, I think the big question is maybe they have plans
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:52.320]   for something that is newer and more interesting
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.560]   and more of a great leap forward, which
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:24:58.400]   is Apple Music 2.0.
[00:24:58.400 --> 00:25:01.440]   Maybe the first step is just to get it onto the devices
[00:25:01.440 --> 00:25:03.680]   and then to do something cool and interesting, which, of course,
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:05.400]   Apple and other companies all the time
[00:25:05.400 --> 00:25:07.400]   relay something kind of half baked and then get around
[00:25:07.400 --> 00:25:09.040]   to doing something more impressive.
[00:25:09.040 --> 00:25:09.520]   Yeah.
[00:25:09.520 --> 00:25:11.680]   That's another part of this that it
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:13.120]   feels like a little bit of a sleeping giant.
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:15.200]   I know this is true to an extent with Google.
[00:25:15.200 --> 00:25:16.720]   It's certainly true with Amazon.
[00:25:16.720 --> 00:25:19.520]   But there was that number that came out in the last year
[00:25:19.520 --> 00:25:24.200]   or so about how many active credit cards Apple has on file.
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:26.200]   How many people are comfortable buying stuff from Apple?
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:27.600]   I don't have an opinion one way or another.
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:29.280]   But it's a super interesting metric to me
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:31.160]   that there are so many people that are OK buying stuff
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:31.960]   with Apple.
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:34.320]   And ideally, they want to find a way
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:35.680]   to run that card more often.
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:37.680]   I'm just kind of surprised because, yeah, I guess.
[00:25:37.680 --> 00:25:39.800]   But I mean, also, I don't know.
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.880]   To me, the big hit would be eventually getting something
[00:25:41.880 --> 00:25:45.720]   with a dev where developers can put stuff on an Apple TV.
[00:25:45.720 --> 00:25:46.840]   Because then you can buy apps.
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:48.920]   You can buy $1,000 worth of apps in a month.
[00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:50.960]   You can only spend $10 a month on streaming.
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:52.360]   It feels a little capped out to me.
[00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:55.280]   I have a product that probably looks a little bit like this kind
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:56.000]   of Apple TV.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:26:00.160]   It's called the Android TV, the Nvidia Shield TV.
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:02.360]   It has an app store, has games.
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:04.120]   It works great with Google Music, which
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:05.160]   I am a subscriber of.
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:08.080]   And the nice thing about Google Music, like Apple Music,
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:11.880]   all my-- whatever I bought, including Beatles Music,
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:16.680]   is on it, plus the 30 million songs that I don't own.
[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:19.640]   And it plays through my stereo, plays through my TV.
[00:26:19.640 --> 00:26:21.600]   I could see an Apple TV being great.
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:24.480]   But again, it's also an also ran.
[00:26:24.480 --> 00:26:27.440]   I think Apple's got trouble if the only thing Apple can say is,
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:29.560]   but it's Apple.
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:35.240]   They have to offer something of value beyond what's out there.
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:39.080]   And it feels like Apple's merely saying, oh, but it's Apple.
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:40.920]   Now, the other thing-- and you bring this up
[00:26:40.920 --> 00:26:43.760]   with the new news program--
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:45.680]   and they've definitely said this on stage.
[00:26:45.680 --> 00:26:49.040]   And we're Apple, and we, unlike those other guys,
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:51.320]   protect your privacy.
[00:26:51.320 --> 00:26:52.160]   Sorry.
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:54.120]   Well, but that's a question, Mark, because how can you,
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:57.440]   for instance-- and this is a great post on Google+,
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:59.280]   I don't know who Thomas Bekdella is,
[00:26:59.280 --> 00:27:01.000]   but he makes a great point.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.520]   He said, if, in fact, as Craig Federigi said,
[00:27:05.520 --> 00:27:09.200]   Apple News is anonymous, not associated with your Apple ID,
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:10.720]   not linked to other Apple services,
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:13.280]   not shared with third parties, you're in control,
[00:27:13.280 --> 00:27:14.400]   there's some negatives to that.
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:18.200]   For instance, my iPad won't know what I've read on my iPhone,
[00:27:18.200 --> 00:27:21.200]   because it's not shared.
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:24.200]   Any, it says it gets smarter as you use it, but only it.
[00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:27.800]   Only that one Apple gets smarter if I reinstall
[00:27:27.800 --> 00:27:29.480]   or use a different device.
[00:27:29.480 --> 00:27:31.000]   It won't know, because it's right, because it's not
[00:27:31.000 --> 00:27:33.040]   kind to my Apple ID.
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:36.040]   So there's an advantage Google has--
[00:27:36.040 --> 00:27:38.480]   there's a advantage other companies have to not saying,
[00:27:38.480 --> 00:27:40.520]   oh, but don't worry, none of this is connected.
[00:27:40.520 --> 00:27:43.320]   Connected sometimes is what consumers want.
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:44.960]   Dylan, you agree?
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:47.720]   I think connected is usually what most consumers always
[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:47.920]   want.
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:49.680]   There's just a tiny, tiny number who
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:51.720]   are concerned about privacy.
[00:27:51.720 --> 00:27:55.240]   And when you come down to it, if it costs anything,
[00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:57.400]   most people would rather give up all their privacy
[00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:57.960]   rather than--
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:58.460]   Right.
[00:27:58.460 --> 00:27:58.960]   --anything.
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:27:59.720]   Let's make it free.
[00:27:59.720 --> 00:28:01.240]   You can have anything.
[00:28:01.240 --> 00:28:02.240]   I love Google now.
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:05.840]   I don't mind giving up whatever it is I'm giving up to Google,
[00:28:05.840 --> 00:28:08.840]   because it's valuable.
[00:28:08.840 --> 00:28:10.960]   The aggregation is valuable.
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:12.640]   That's not to say we shouldn't be concerned.
[00:28:12.640 --> 00:28:15.360]   I think there are absolutely legitimate reasons
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:17.880]   to be concerned about privacy.
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:19.920]   But most consumers don't agree yet,
[00:28:19.920 --> 00:28:23.960]   because most consumers haven't experienced anything
[00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:27.400]   that would lead them to feel like losing their privacy
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:29.240]   was anything bad.
[00:28:29.240 --> 00:28:31.000]   It's like the vaccine argument, right?
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:31.360]   It was--
[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:32.560]   Nobody around me is getting measles,
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:34.680]   so I don't need the vaccine.
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:37.680]   I mean, a few-- a couple, three weeks ago,
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:39.800]   news started bubble up about a story at Annenberg School
[00:28:39.800 --> 00:28:42.160]   for Communications, which is University of Pennsylvania
[00:28:42.160 --> 00:28:42.440]   School.
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:43.400]   It is a study.
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:45.120]   And basically, they said just Americans
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:47.360]   have given up on the concept of privacy.
[00:28:47.360 --> 00:28:49.680]   Americans want privacy, but they've given up.
[00:28:49.680 --> 00:28:52.120]   They always say they want it, which is not the same as I do.
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:53.200]   It's actually interesting they'll never get it.
[00:28:53.200 --> 00:28:56.120]   It's actually taking actions to preserve it.
[00:28:56.120 --> 00:28:57.640]   As long as it's convenient and free,
[00:28:57.640 --> 00:28:58.480]   they're all for privacy.
[00:28:58.480 --> 00:29:01.520]   I have to say, though, our audience is outspoken in that.
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:04.840]   And privacy, it's going to be very loud.
[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:08.440]   And so people get the impression that the American public does.
[00:29:08.440 --> 00:29:09.680]   I think the American public does care,
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:11.040]   but I think they also acknowledge, look,
[00:29:11.040 --> 00:29:12.560]   I go into a Target store.
[00:29:12.560 --> 00:29:14.800]   They know exactly what I'm going to buy.
[00:29:14.800 --> 00:29:16.840]   They know exactly what coupons defeat me.
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:19.720]   There is no advertising privacy.
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:22.640]   This is, again, from this incredible post from Thomas
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:23.080]   Bechtahl.
[00:29:23.080 --> 00:29:26.760]   He quotes Tim Cook saying, they're gobbling up,
[00:29:26.760 --> 00:29:28.120]   talking about other companies, everything
[00:29:28.120 --> 00:29:30.960]   they can learn about you and trying to monetize it.
[00:29:30.960 --> 00:29:32.840]   "We think that's wrong," says Apple.
[00:29:32.840 --> 00:29:35.160]   And it's not the kind of company Apple wants to be.
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:36.800]   We don't want your data.
[00:29:36.800 --> 00:29:38.560]   And then at that very same event,
[00:29:38.560 --> 00:29:41.760]   they launched three news services, Apple Wallet, Apple Music,
[00:29:41.760 --> 00:29:44.520]   and Apple News, both featuring individual targeting,
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:48.040]   tracking, and tailoring integrated directly into Iads,
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:49.440]   Apple's ad platform.
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:51.280]   He says, I call shenanigans.
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:54.320]   They're doing what Google does and what everybody does.
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:56.480]   And Google should not be available on the iPhone
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:29:59.320]   if it's really as disastrous as they say.
[00:29:59.320 --> 00:30:01.160]   Well, I think Apple's working hard towards that.
[00:30:01.160 --> 00:30:02.880]   Well, the problem is customers want it.
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:05.160]   And I don't think you can look at what Tim Cook is saying
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:08.440]   outside of the context of Apple having this archival called
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:12.440]   Google, whose business is making tools better
[00:30:12.440 --> 00:30:14.440]   by storing your data and using it.
[00:30:14.440 --> 00:30:17.920]   And see monetizing by selling advertising?
[00:30:17.920 --> 00:30:22.280]   Look, nobody's denying that the iPhone sells very well.
[00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:24.720]   And I would bet that a lot of people who buy the iPhone
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:28.400]   are aware of the promise, whether it's the reality or not,
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:30.160]   that Apple's going to protect their privacy.
[00:30:30.160 --> 00:30:33.640]   And that's certainly part of the reason they choose it, right?
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:36.760]   But that's also what was so interesting about that study.
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:39.560]   There's a really-- it's a good summary of it up on CNET.
[00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:41.920]   It's Americans resigned to giving up their privacy.
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:45.720]   But in the survey, they found out 65% of Americans believed
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:48.000]   the mere mention of a privacy policy
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:51.160]   meant that your privacy was protected by that company.
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:55.680]   Or that Expedia and Orbit are legally required
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:59.440]   to give you the lowest possible price when you're searching
[00:30:59.440 --> 00:31:00.120]   for the--
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:01.120]   No.
[00:31:01.120 --> 00:31:02.400]   It's a really good write-up.
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:03.640]   But I was a kid.
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:06.800]   I remember we'd say, oh, they can't say it on an ad
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:08.240]   if it's not true.
[00:31:08.240 --> 00:31:09.720]   Remember that?
[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:11.640]   Did you ever think that as a kid?
[00:31:11.640 --> 00:31:13.600]   You go, oh, no, no, they wouldn't--
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:15.920]   the government would let him say it if it's not true.
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:17.120]   Yeah, good luck with that.
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:19.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:21.360]   Because it's kind of like that.
[00:31:21.360 --> 00:31:24.000]   I just remember being 10 ordering something mail order.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:25.880]   And it was an out-and-out lie.
[00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:28.760]   And that is the beginning of that.
[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:31.040]   And having a publisher change a review I wrote
[00:31:31.040 --> 00:31:33.920]   from my very first printed review in a guitar magazine
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:35.400]   and made it a glowing endorsement of one
[00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:37.760]   of the biggest pieces of crap I have ever seen in my life.
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:39.000]   You panned it, and he changed it?
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:40.520]   He changed it completely.
[00:31:40.520 --> 00:31:42.040]   And I never wrote for the magazine again.
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:45.440]   And I've never, ever not had head full editorial control.
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:46.840]   And your eyes were opened.
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:47.760]   My eyes were just--
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.440]   I realized that everything I read in that magazine
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:51.760]   had been a complete fabrication for the last eight years
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:53.680]   of my life, which was also heartbreaking.
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:54.640]   Yeah.
[00:31:54.640 --> 00:31:57.480]   It's tough when you grow up and you realize the world's crap.
[00:31:57.480 --> 00:32:00.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:00.680]   No, it's not.
[00:32:00.680 --> 00:32:02.000]   It's a wonderful place.
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:02.640]   It is wonderful.
[00:32:02.640 --> 00:32:06.040]   And yeah, everything is so great.
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:07.160]   It's a wonderful life, Leo.
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:07.960]   It is.
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:09.640]   We love it.
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:11.640]   So I feel like-- and I know I'm going to get email.
[00:32:11.640 --> 00:32:13.560]   Oh, why are you so hard on Apple?
[00:32:13.560 --> 00:32:15.560]   Are we being hard on Apple?
[00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:18.600]   Are we asking Apple just to do what everybody--
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:20.400]   to be straightforward?
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:21.800]   And I do see problems ahead.
[00:32:21.800 --> 00:32:27.080]   I think-- all right, now this is very dangerous territory.
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:28.080]   Is Apple--
[00:32:28.080 --> 00:32:30.240]   Merlin, you're an Apple fanatic.
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:30.520]   You're an--
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:31.120]   Am I?
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:32.960]   You seem like you're a little negative on that.
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:34.640]   Is Apple stumbling?
[00:32:34.640 --> 00:32:35.720]   Oh, no.
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:39.520]   I'm just very critical of stuff that I love.
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:40.360]   Yeah, me too.
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:40.880]   I agree.
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:43.440]   You'll notice how many things I don't have a comment about.
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:44.800]   I expect more of Apple.
[00:32:44.800 --> 00:32:46.520]   I only get mad at stuff I want to get better.
[00:32:46.520 --> 00:32:47.520]   And I really do.
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:49.000]   I believe that--
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:50.720]   I don't know.
[00:32:50.720 --> 00:32:54.440]   I guess I'm a little less skeptical or cynical
[00:32:54.440 --> 00:32:55.560]   about Tim Cook's Apple.
[00:32:55.560 --> 00:32:57.440]   I really think he does want to do the right thing.
[00:32:57.440 --> 00:32:59.800]   I think part of the problem is that we as consumers--
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:02.960]   I mean, you hear those numbers about how jobs are created,
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:04.720]   jobs are not being created, how many people are applying
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:06.600]   for trying to get new jobs.
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:09.480]   There's a certain point of fatigue that people reach.
[00:33:09.480 --> 00:33:11.040]   In a down economy where they're not even trying
[00:33:11.040 --> 00:33:12.080]   to get a job anymore.
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:13.800]   I think that's kind of where we are for the moment
[00:33:13.800 --> 00:33:16.280]   with privacy, where it feels completely out of people's
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:16.840]   control.
[00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:18.320]   I don't know how you blame for that.
[00:33:18.320 --> 00:33:20.360]   But if you start reading Cribs on security every day,
[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:22.080]   you open your eyes a little bit, and you
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:23.720]   start to realize what all is out there.
[00:33:23.720 --> 00:33:26.320]   Maybe you can't control it all, absolutely.
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:28.560]   But I'm glad somebody's out there, at least showing
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:31.080]   that there is a value proposition to be made for taking
[00:33:31.080 --> 00:33:32.120]   a stand on this.
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:34.600]   So I use lots of Google stuff, and I like lots of Google stuff.
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:37.400]   I'm not a Google, like, Tinfoil hat guy.
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:40.720]   Because they do deliver a lot of value for what I perceive them
[00:33:40.720 --> 00:33:41.480]   taking away.
[00:33:41.480 --> 00:33:44.760]   I think what drives people nuts is when there's opacity
[00:33:44.760 --> 00:33:45.960]   to these processes.
[00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:49.520]   And even people who try to bone up and do the right thing,
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:50.640]   it's difficult.
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:52.560]   It's difficult to have two-factor authentication
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:53.520]   on everything and do it.
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:56.040]   It's difficult to enter a military grade password using
[00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:57.800]   an Apple 4-way dingus on an Apple TV.
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:33:59.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:01.920]   I would love to have seen Steve Jobs live long enough
[00:34:01.920 --> 00:34:04.600]   to enter a three-chillion-year password using one
[00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:05.440]   of those things.
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:09.840]   So I think it's in the trouble is there's--
[00:34:09.840 --> 00:34:12.560]   I'm not to blame the media, as Mosiz Lacks says.
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:15.160]   But part of it is in the way that this is always presented.
[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:18.120]   Cyber security and cyber threats and cyber problems.
[00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:20.280]   Like, no, this is just our life now.
[00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:22.080]   And there has to be some more sanity
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:24.480]   brought to what we can all do on this together.
[00:34:24.480 --> 00:34:25.920]   So how much of the stuff that happens
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:27.400]   is just pure social engineering.
[00:34:27.400 --> 00:34:28.960]   What company are you going to blame for that?
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:29.440]   I don't know.
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:31.200]   I guess I just feel like there's still so much
[00:34:31.200 --> 00:34:31.920]   we could all do better.
[00:34:31.920 --> 00:34:34.280]   And I'd like to see a company--
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:35.600]   lip service, maybe not so great.
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:37.480]   But I do feel like Apple does care about that.
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:39.240]   And they wouldn't be saying it unless they thought
[00:34:39.240 --> 00:34:41.200]   that they were doing it better.
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:43.000]   They have to find a way to differentiate themselves.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:46.040]   So I'm not-- I wouldn't say I'm an Apple fanatic.
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:47.480]   Apple's the stuff that I use, so I
[00:34:47.480 --> 00:34:49.600]   have to be cynical about it sometimes.
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:51.200]   And I don't know.
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:54.320]   I hope that we all get to a place where we can evolve
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:57.200]   and adapt beyond the way we've done stuff, essentially,
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:58.280]   for 50 years.
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:00.520]   I mean, it's time for some really new thinking about stuff
[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:03.760]   like name password pairs as the way we deal with life.
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:06.520]   And so anyway, I hope that's a conversation we--
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:08.160]   I guess what I want to say, I would
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:09.680]   hate to get to the point where we all just throw our hands up
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:11.360]   in the air and say nobody cares anymore.
[00:35:11.360 --> 00:35:12.840]   Because I mean, I care.
[00:35:12.840 --> 00:35:15.160]   I can't even if I can't be perfect at it, I still care.
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:18.560]   And I hope that the generation the younger than us
[00:35:18.560 --> 00:35:19.240]   will care, too.
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:20.600]   They're the ones that matter.
[00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:21.880]   Nobody cares what we think.
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:22.720]   I hope they care.
[00:35:22.720 --> 00:35:26.360]   And I hope they hold people to a higher standard of taking
[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:28.360]   care of us, I guess, and taking care of ourselves.
[00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:29.960]   Until they get beat down like we are,
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:31.480]   and then they'll give up, too.
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:33.320]   Oh, no, that's unavoidable.
[00:35:33.320 --> 00:35:36.000]   You know, enjoy the confidence while you're young guys.
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:37.400]   Enjoy it.
[00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:39.840]   Be able to stand and sit without making a noise.
[00:35:39.840 --> 00:35:40.360]   Oh, man.
[00:35:40.360 --> 00:35:41.480]   Move your bowels in a normal way.
[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:42.000]   And some day.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:42.640]   In some way, you can.
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:43.200]   Really, it's good.
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:44.640]   It doesn't last a while to go out of that way.
[00:35:44.640 --> 00:35:45.640]   Sleep while you can, because you're
[00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:47.360]   going to be dead someday.
[00:35:47.360 --> 00:35:48.480]   Let me review.
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:51.000]   I had a very special episode of two where--
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:53.680]   Let me wrap this up with two questions related.
[00:35:53.680 --> 00:35:56.440]   One is, how important is it to Apple that Apple Music
[00:35:56.440 --> 00:35:57.000]   succeeds?
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.840]   Is it, in fact, going to be enough to replace iTunes sales,
[00:36:01.840 --> 00:36:03.560]   which are clearly declining?
[00:36:03.560 --> 00:36:09.080]   And on the other side, how important to the music industry
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:10.120]   is it?
[00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:11.920]   And what does the music industry do?
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:14.520]   You, Merlin, gave us an article from a pitchfork
[00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:17.280]   that shows how little bands make--
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:20.200]   and we know this-- from Pandora and Spotify.
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:20.720]   But what--
[00:36:20.720 --> 00:36:22.640]   But we do not know how comically low it is.
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:23.360]   Oh, it's--
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:24.920]   Well, but that's also--
[00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:26.960]   It's actually funny how little it is.
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:30.360]   But part of that's not necessarily, in many cases,
[00:36:30.360 --> 00:36:32.120]   the fault of Spotify or Pandora.
[00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:32.920]   It could be the labels.
[00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:34.320]   The labels take--
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:34.920]   You know what I mean?
[00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:36.520]   The labels take the big chunk of everything.
[00:36:36.520 --> 00:36:39.200]   But music is not in good shape.
[00:36:39.200 --> 00:36:40.760]   You think?
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:43.160]   When music-- I hate to say the music industry.
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:44.120]   Just find a good shape.
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:46.000]   If you're an artist--
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:46.800]   I remember talking--
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:48.280]   Parents about the industry, really.
[00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:48.680]   No, no, no.
[00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:49.600]   It's about artists.
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:50.360]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:51.000]   That's what I mean.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:52.960]   If you're an artist, you may have a hard time
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:55.720]   making money the traditional music industry ways.
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:59.400]   But isn't it true that you can reach a bigger audience
[00:36:59.400 --> 00:37:01.840]   than ever before if you want to go on YouTube?
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:03.000]   Or you want to--
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.800]   I mean, aren't there more ways to build a fan base
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:08.720]   and build a following than ever before?
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:10.840]   I mean, you can't make money by selling CDs,
[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:12.440]   but maybe you can make money by--
[00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:13.640]   But nobody ever made money.
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:14.640]   Selling concert tickets.
[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:15.880]   There was a small group of people
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:17.520]   that made a lot of money off CDs.
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:18.720]   It's always been a small group.
[00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:20.240]   Most artists, even the huge artists,
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:22.920]   made their money off of the tours and the merch on the tours.
[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:24.920]   Certainly, so that's not much of a change.
[00:37:24.920 --> 00:37:26.400]   That hasn't changed that much.
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:28.880]   I mean, we want artists to succeed.
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:31.760]   And we want young people coming up as musicians,
[00:37:31.760 --> 00:37:34.320]   as performers, to be able to make a living.
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:35.560]   Yes, it would be nice.
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:38.880]   And it sounds like Dylan, you're saying, the good news
[00:37:38.880 --> 00:37:40.640]   is that is doable.
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:42.120]   You just can't do it the old way.
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:42.720]   Well, I mean--
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:44.160]   Well, it's easy for me to say, I'm
[00:37:44.160 --> 00:37:47.320]   not trying to make a living as an artist of any kind.
[00:37:47.320 --> 00:37:50.680]   But it does seem like there are some possibilities
[00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:52.520]   for making a living as a musician.
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:55.040]   If you're willing to look outside the sort of,
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:56.840]   I need to get a big contract from the major--
[00:37:56.840 --> 00:37:58.200]   You're not plattin' the artists.
[00:37:58.200 --> 00:37:59.040]   Probably not.
[00:37:59.040 --> 00:38:01.760]   But this is-- yeah, I mean, but this is not--
[00:38:01.760 --> 00:38:04.600]   This situation hasn't changed much in the last 30 years,
[00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:06.200]   because I can remember interviewing people
[00:38:06.200 --> 00:38:07.680]   where all they wanted to be was like,
[00:38:07.680 --> 00:38:09.080]   we're looking for a big record deal.
[00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:11.200]   And I'm like, you need to talk to people with big record
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:12.680]   here, because they're not making money
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:14.200]   over the records, right?
[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:15.600]   But I think it has changed.
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:17.600]   In one way, Patrick, I think it has changed,
[00:38:17.600 --> 00:38:19.800]   which is that you can build a following on Twitter,
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:20.680]   YouTube, or what have--
[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:21.760]   But that's what I'm saying, though, is--
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:23.760]   And a Palmer, you look at Zoe Keating.
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:26.160]   Like, there are a lot of artists out there who have sort of--
[00:38:26.160 --> 00:38:27.160]   They're not huge.
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:28.680]   They're not getting rich off their music,
[00:38:28.680 --> 00:38:29.680]   but they're supporting--
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:30.520]   Thanks to Patreon.
[00:38:30.520 --> 00:38:31.440]   Thanks to YouTube.
[00:38:31.440 --> 00:38:32.600]   And they're always going to say--
[00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:34.720]   Yeah, I mean, nobody's been rich off of YouTube.
[00:38:34.720 --> 00:38:36.160]   Patreon's been amazing.
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:38.360]   Patreon is supporting tech thing,
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:39.880]   and there's all these other people doing it.
[00:38:39.880 --> 00:38:41.920]   And I'm not saying there's not 1,000 other ways.
[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:44.040]   What I find that ironic is there's still people that want
[00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:45.640]   a record deal, even when they know,
[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:48.440]   because everything is so public on the internet now,
[00:38:48.440 --> 00:38:50.360]   that they're probably not going to make any money
[00:38:50.360 --> 00:38:51.880]   and get screwed by the record label.
[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:53.320]   I mean, I can remember having been--
[00:38:53.320 --> 00:38:54.520]   I have issues with record companies,
[00:38:54.520 --> 00:38:58.160]   because there's nothing more unpleasant in the world
[00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:00.600]   than being in a meeting with a pissed off PR person
[00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:03.720]   for a record company, at least when the record companies
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:05.120]   were making money hand over fist.
[00:39:05.120 --> 00:39:05.880]   They were nasty.
[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:06.600]   They were vicious.
[00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:07.440]   They were manipulative.
[00:39:07.440 --> 00:39:08.560]   They handled things.
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:09.920]   You won't have access to this artist.
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:11.840]   If you don't put this artist on the cover of your magazine
[00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:13.000]   this month--
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:13.720]   That's pretty common.
[00:39:13.720 --> 00:39:14.920]   When you're in power--
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:15.160]   Yeah.
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:16.720]   Companies in power tend to do stuff like that.
[00:39:16.720 --> 00:39:18.200]   They tend to do stuff like that.
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:21.400]   And they were making money that the artists weren't seeing.
[00:39:21.400 --> 00:39:23.160]   And it's always been like that.
[00:39:23.160 --> 00:39:26.640]   And I think it's disingenuous for people to blame, say,
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:28.760]   Spotify for them not making a lot of money
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:30.960]   when the record company's cashing larger checks
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:32.080]   and just not giving them a cut.
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:33.200]   That's a contract problem.
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:34.160]   That's an industry problem.
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:36.880]   But yes, there are so many better ways to make music.
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:39.800]   So question two was music industry.
[00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:42.000]   So we all are in the affirmative that there
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:43.240]   is a future going forward.
[00:39:43.240 --> 00:39:45.640]   It's just not going to be the way the record labels want it
[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:48.760]   to be, or maybe even Spotify, Apple, Music, and Pandora
[00:39:48.760 --> 00:39:49.560]   want it to be.
[00:39:49.560 --> 00:39:51.120]   But artists do have an opportunity
[00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:53.120]   if they know how to work the system properly.
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:54.840]   And I don't think when all of a sudden
[00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:58.000]   done it's all that essential to Apple that Apple Music do
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:39:58.360]   well.
[00:39:58.360 --> 00:39:59.800]   That's the second question.
[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:00.480]   It's not good.
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:03.640]   For Spotify, Spotify definitely has to figure out music
[00:40:03.640 --> 00:40:06.160]   because if it doesn't have that, it has very little.
[00:40:06.160 --> 00:40:09.160]   For Apple, I mean, music was great to get people to buy
[00:40:09.160 --> 00:40:11.880]   iPods in the first place.
[00:40:11.880 --> 00:40:13.840]   The great thing about the iPhone now
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:16.000]   is it's a great platform for all these third-party music
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:16.880]   services.
[00:40:16.880 --> 00:40:18.880]   I'm still buying Apple's hardware.
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:22.160]   And Apple is never going to be all that dependent on revenue
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:23.160]   from selling music.
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:24.320]   So you could probably make the case
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:27.080]   that it's more important for the iWatch or the Apple Watch
[00:40:27.080 --> 00:40:28.640]   to do well than the Apple Music to do well.
[00:40:28.640 --> 00:40:29.400]   Totally, totally.
[00:40:29.400 --> 00:40:31.760]   They have to be an important device on your wrist.
[00:40:31.760 --> 00:40:33.160]   That is really important to them.
[00:40:33.160 --> 00:40:35.800]   They need a successor to the iPhone at some point.
[00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:37.320]   If Apple Music does well, great.
[00:40:37.320 --> 00:40:39.240]   If Apple Music is something of a disappointment,
[00:40:39.240 --> 00:40:41.600]   I don't think Tim Cook loses all that much sleep.
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:43.320]   Even if the revenue from iTunes went away,
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:45.640]   it's not so much money that it was going to hurt them.
[00:40:45.640 --> 00:40:49.520]   It was the iTunes is 10 billion out of 182 billion earnings
[00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:50.800]   for Apple in 24--
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:52.520]   it's nice to be in that position.
[00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:53.600]   It's really the iPhone.
[00:40:53.600 --> 00:40:54.960]   It's the iPhone.
[00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:57.960]   It's all about the iPhone.
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:40:59.280]   But they need a successor to that.
[00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:02.720]   I think the professional iPad might be something to look at.
[00:41:02.720 --> 00:41:04.800]   I think the Apple Watch has some potential.
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:06.680]   All right, we're going to--
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:09.640]   Merlin, one last final word on the Apple event.
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:10.880]   Anything else to say?
[00:41:10.880 --> 00:41:13.280]   Are you a fan of Drake?
[00:41:13.280 --> 00:41:14.680]   Oh, huge fan.
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:17.880]   I'm just happy that he knows so many famous people.
[00:41:17.880 --> 00:41:19.680]   I was kind enough to share that with us.
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:20.520]   I agree with you guys.
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:23.840]   I don't think-- see, I don't know anything about business.
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:27.200]   But I don't see how this needs to happen for Apple.
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:28.880]   It sounds like another one of those things
[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:30.640]   where somebody up in the Peanut Gallery is screaming
[00:41:30.640 --> 00:41:33.600]   about what Apple has to do in order to be successful.
[00:41:33.600 --> 00:41:34.920]   Look at what they've done well with.
[00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:37.240]   And what they have done well with is finding a way
[00:41:37.240 --> 00:41:39.960]   to start with something that everybody thought
[00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:42.440]   was a lost cause, find a way to make it beautiful sexy
[00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:44.640]   and costly, find the people who want that,
[00:41:44.640 --> 00:41:48.240]   and then give them a way to buy huge amounts of more stuff
[00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:49.320]   with that.
[00:41:49.320 --> 00:41:52.840]   So the thing is, having a commodity music service
[00:41:52.840 --> 00:41:55.320]   where you're competing on price, that does not feel like Apple
[00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:55.760]   to me.
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:41:57.880]   So I think that's why I feel like this really feels
[00:41:57.880 --> 00:41:59.640]   like an out-of-left field thing.
[00:41:59.640 --> 00:42:00.120]   I don't know.
[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:01.280]   I don't think that's a big part.
[00:42:01.280 --> 00:42:03.760]   They were part of the undoing of the way the music industry
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:04.360]   worked.
[00:42:04.360 --> 00:42:06.920]   And now I think that's probably harming them a little bit, too.
[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:08.640]   Truth is, though, they don't have to sell iPhones.
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:09.880]   It's not the most important thing.
[00:42:09.880 --> 00:42:12.200]   Now they're selling iPhones, and they want you buying apps.
[00:42:12.200 --> 00:42:14.520]   So anyway, I'd love to be back sometime
[00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:16.840]   to talk about the Apple TV, because I
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:19.800]   think that's a really interesting place the future is headed,
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:22.240]   especially when that becomes the hub for all of your home stuff.
[00:42:22.240 --> 00:42:24.600]   Yeah, I wanted to see something about Apple TV.
[00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:27.040]   I was so disappointed that there was nothing about Apple TV
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:27.440]   of something.
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:29.880]   So there's no reason we have to drop it.
[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:31.320]   Let's come back and talk about it.
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:32.320]   That'll be our next subject.
[00:42:32.320 --> 00:42:33.720]   There are so many things to talk about.
[00:42:33.720 --> 00:42:37.280]   This is going to be the first 18-hour tour, and I'm really glad
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:39.240]   that the audience is going, oh my god.
[00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:42.000]   And we have the most uncomfortable chairs we've ever sat in.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:42.960]   Merlin Mann is here.
[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:44.440]   It's so great to have you back.
[00:42:44.440 --> 00:42:46.800]   What do you want to plug?
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:51.160]   Oh, hell, you mean to make people go and do a thing?
[00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:53.160]   Yeah, make them go and do a thing.
[00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:54.160]   I don't like plugging.
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:55.120]   I've got two new things.
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:56.400]   I would love people to go and check out.
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:56.880]   There you go.
[00:42:56.880 --> 00:42:59.160]   This is a show I mentioned with Jim Dowerimple,
[00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:00.200]   called the Dowerimple Report.
[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:03.560]   You can get that at loopinsight.com/theDowerimpleReport.
[00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:05.080]   So it's you and Jim?
[00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:05.600]   Yeah.
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:07.000]   Oh my god, that's going to be great.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   So you talk for half an hour, then he goes, yep.
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:11.080]   So basically how it goes?
[00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:11.440]   You know what?
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:12.000]   You don't need to listen.
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:12.280]   That's it.
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:13.280]   That's the whole thing.
[00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:14.200]   That's Jim.
[00:43:14.200 --> 00:43:15.600]   Here's Jim.
[00:43:15.600 --> 00:43:16.600]   Yep.
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:17.600]   That's it.
[00:43:17.600 --> 00:43:20.200]   And the other show I'm very excited about on relay.fm
[00:43:20.200 --> 00:43:22.520]   is a show called Reconsylable Differences.
[00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:23.960]   That's me and John Sierra Qusa.
[00:43:23.960 --> 00:43:26.280]   Do a show I'm very excited about.
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:29.760]   And you can see that at relay.fm/rd.
[00:43:29.760 --> 00:43:30.280]   Nice.
[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:31.600]   And I'm really proud of both of those.
[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:32.200]   I do other stuff.
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:33.200]   I still do back to work with Dan.
[00:43:33.200 --> 00:43:35.440]   I do Rotter than the Lion with John Rotterich.
[00:43:35.440 --> 00:43:36.120]   I do lots of stuff.
[00:43:36.120 --> 00:43:38.200]   But I'm very happy to be here.
[00:43:38.200 --> 00:43:39.360]   It's nice that you've--
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:41.160]   We love Merlin Man.
[00:43:41.160 --> 00:43:42.800]   And we're so thrilled to have you.
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:44.160]   I'm going to get a better camera for next time.
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:44.520]   This is so great.
[00:43:44.520 --> 00:43:45.320]   It looks good.
[00:43:45.320 --> 00:43:47.880]   You do look like you might be one of the two guys that escaped
[00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:48.960]   from prison last week.
[00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:49.800]   But rather than that--
[00:43:49.800 --> 00:43:51.040]   You think you're better than me.
[00:43:51.040 --> 00:43:51.960]   I have the blue light.
[00:43:51.960 --> 00:43:53.160]   I can get the blue light on.
[00:43:53.160 --> 00:43:54.000]   That'll make you look--
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.080]   Oh, much better.
[00:43:55.080 --> 00:43:56.160]   Much better.
[00:43:56.160 --> 00:43:57.760]   Much better.
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:59.000]   OK, now.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:00.440]   Yeah.
[00:44:00.440 --> 00:44:02.920]   Harry McCracken, the technologizer, is here.
[00:44:02.920 --> 00:44:05.240]   You can read his works at fastcompany.com.
[00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:07.800]   Follow Harry and Marie on Instagram.
[00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:09.480]   I love your pictures.
[00:44:09.480 --> 00:44:10.840]   I love your pictures.
[00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:11.760]   Wild stuff.
[00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:14.360]   Where were you at the Computer History Museum?
[00:44:14.360 --> 00:44:16.320]   I saw a lot of old stuff.
[00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:19.320]   My feet is probably about half stuff about old technology.
[00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:19.800]   I love that.
[00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:21.360]   And when Radio Shack is finally out of business,
[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:23.280]   I'm going to be in trouble, because I keep going into Radio
[00:44:23.280 --> 00:44:26.040]   Shack and Instagram, mainly going out of business sales.
[00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:29.080]   I love it.
[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:30.200]   What is it on Instagram?
[00:44:30.200 --> 00:44:31.040]   Is it technologizer or here?
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:31.680]   Technologizer.
[00:44:31.680 --> 00:44:32.240]   Technologizer.
[00:44:32.240 --> 00:44:32.760]   OK.
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:36.520]   Yeah, I keep up with my friends, basically, on Instagram.
[00:44:36.520 --> 00:44:38.520]   That's the only way I know anything that's going on.
[00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:40.080]   I put photos of you on Instagram.
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:41.120]   They're always a huge shot.
[00:44:41.120 --> 00:44:41.600]   Thank you.
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:44.000]   I will put you on your segue up as soon as the show is over.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.040]   Oh, good.
[00:44:45.040 --> 00:44:45.720]   That should be fun.
[00:44:45.720 --> 00:44:48.320]   I rode in on the segue.
[00:44:48.320 --> 00:44:50.520]   My buddy, Patrick Norton's here, you've
[00:44:50.520 --> 00:44:54.120]   got to watch last episode of the new screensavers.
[00:44:54.120 --> 00:44:55.760]   So much fun.
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:44:59.040]   And of course, tech thing, T-E-K-T-H-I-N-G.com.
[00:44:59.040 --> 00:45:02.440]   $2,100 less expensive than T-E-C-H-T-H-I-N-G.
[00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:03.360]   That's a big difference.
[00:45:03.360 --> 00:45:05.240]   But you know, with that Patreon money rolling in,
[00:45:05.240 --> 00:45:07.320]   you and snubs might be able to afford that someday.
[00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:08.720]   You know, I just want to make a living.
[00:45:08.720 --> 00:45:09.400]   I have children.
[00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:11.800]   I just want to make a living.
[00:45:11.800 --> 00:45:13.960]   That's all he asks, folks.
[00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:15.480]   And brand new to the show.
[00:45:15.480 --> 00:45:16.280]   And I'm thrilled to have him.
[00:45:16.280 --> 00:45:17.080]   Dylan Twainy.
[00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:20.040]   Great to have you from VentureBeat.com.
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:24.400]   Editor at large is like the best title you could have.
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:26.520]   That means you can do anything you want, right?
[00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:28.200]   Yeah, I don't have to go to the office anymore.
[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:33.480]   I can go down to Las Vegas and file 10,000 word stream of--
[00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:34.800]   Oh, you're like Hunter S. Thompson.
[00:45:34.800 --> 00:45:36.240]   Is that what you're saying?
[00:45:36.240 --> 00:45:39.480]   That's what I'm aiming for, yeah.
[00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:41.120]   So watch out.
[00:45:41.120 --> 00:45:48.040]   My-- I was visiting a friend of Dvorak's Will Hurst
[00:45:48.040 --> 00:45:49.880]   when he was editor in chief of the Examiner
[00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:53.920]   and was responsible for getting Hunter S. Thompson to file.
[00:45:53.920 --> 00:45:56.240]   And I'll never forget listening into one half
[00:45:56.240 --> 00:45:59.560]   of a phone conversation where Will's going, Hunter, Hunter,
[00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:01.400]   listen to me.
[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:03.360]   We put the favorite event in half an hour.
[00:46:03.360 --> 00:46:05.040]   Where'd you come?
[00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:08.240]   Anyway, must have been fun working with that fella.
[00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:11.240]   Kind of like working with Keith Holberman.
[00:46:11.240 --> 00:46:12.400]   More to come in just a second.
[00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:13.760]   Let's talk TV, Apple TV.
[00:46:13.760 --> 00:46:17.200]   Merlin, you and Jim did a whole show on TV.
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:17.720]   So--
[00:46:17.720 --> 00:46:18.800]   Yeah, yeah, actually we did.
[00:46:18.800 --> 00:46:19.760]   Talked about cord cutting.
[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:21.840]   And a lot of it was, as we say in New York
[00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:23.880]   nice today, blue sky solutioneering.
[00:46:23.880 --> 00:46:24.720]   Just kind of--
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:25.720]   You're the king.
[00:46:25.720 --> 00:46:26.560]   What's the pointy matter?
[00:46:26.560 --> 00:46:27.440]   It's the back side.
[00:46:27.440 --> 00:46:28.960]   No, but basically--
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:30.120]   Don't say--
[00:46:30.120 --> 00:46:31.080]   Save it.
[00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:31.760]   Save it.
[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:32.720]   Don't start.
[00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:35.880]   This is the good stuff, but I get it in that.
[00:46:35.880 --> 00:46:36.720]   Look at that.
[00:46:36.720 --> 00:46:37.720]   He froze.
[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:39.560]   I'm good.
[00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:41.440]   You take orders well, Mr. May.
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:42.440]   Thank you.
[00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:45.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:48.760]   About to you by Audible.com.
[00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:49.520]   We love Audible.
[00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:51.240]   There's no reason to even do the ad.
[00:46:51.240 --> 00:46:53.040]   Just get it, OK?
[00:46:53.040 --> 00:46:54.160]   We actually have two books for you.
[00:46:54.160 --> 00:46:56.080]   Audible.com/twit2.
[00:46:56.080 --> 00:47:01.040]   It is the largest and best audio bookstore in the world.
[00:47:01.040 --> 00:47:03.520]   180,000 titles.
[00:47:03.520 --> 00:47:05.120]   And now, summertime's coming.
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:06.640]   Your summertime reading is so much better.
[00:47:06.640 --> 00:47:09.160]   You're lying on the beach, not trying to read between the sand
[00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:10.680]   grains and the sun.
[00:47:10.680 --> 00:47:14.000]   You can just listen and relax on the plane.
[00:47:14.000 --> 00:47:16.600]   I got a big flight coming up in a couple of weeks.
[00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:19.120]   I'm loading up on the Audible books.
[00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:20.200]   And what I do is--
[00:47:20.200 --> 00:47:22.040]   there's Neil deGrasse Tyson.
[00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:25.120]   What I do is I alternate between fiction and nonfiction,
[00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:26.880]   back and forth, back and forth.
[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:30.200]   So I get a little bit of escape, little science fiction.
[00:47:30.200 --> 00:47:31.600]   Got the new Neil Stevenson.
[00:47:31.600 --> 00:47:33.360]   You know, you and I are Neil Stevenson for that.
[00:47:33.360 --> 00:47:33.880]   Yes.
[00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:35.640]   You read the Baroque cycle.
[00:47:35.640 --> 00:47:37.280]   I just reread it.
[00:47:37.280 --> 00:47:37.680]   Watch it.
[00:47:37.680 --> 00:47:38.280]   Two months ago.
[00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:38.600]   Yeah.
[00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:39.640]   It's a whole time.
[00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:41.080]   I have it on Audible, but I don't
[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:42.600]   know if I'm going to be able to get through it here.
[00:47:42.600 --> 00:47:43.600]   Season of the Witch.
[00:47:43.600 --> 00:47:45.040]   Season of the Witch.
[00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:45.440]   You know it.
[00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:46.720]   Just left it up.
[00:47:46.720 --> 00:47:48.400]   Enchantment, Terror, and Deliverance
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:49.880]   in the City of Love, David Tal.
[00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:53.600]   But it's San Francisco in the late '60s, '70s.
[00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:54.120]   It's already--
[00:47:54.120 --> 00:47:54.880]   It's fantastic.
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:55.760]   Can't wait to read it.
[00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:56.200]   It's amazing.
[00:47:56.200 --> 00:47:57.080]   It's unhinged.
[00:47:57.080 --> 00:47:58.600]   That's my next book.
[00:47:58.600 --> 00:48:01.360]   Is this the salon, David Tal?
[00:48:01.360 --> 00:48:02.200]   Yeah.
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:02.680]   Yeah.
[00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:03.120]   Cool.
[00:48:03.120 --> 00:48:03.440]   Yeah.
[00:48:03.440 --> 00:48:04.000]   Isn't that great?
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:04.760]   He's a great writer.
[00:48:04.760 --> 00:48:05.760]   He's a great writer.
[00:48:05.760 --> 00:48:06.760]   Yeah.
[00:48:06.760 --> 00:48:09.960]   We interviewed Ashley Vance last week on triangulation
[00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:13.920]   about his new book, Elon Musk, Tesla's SpaceX and the Quest
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:15.040]   for a fantastic future.
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:16.400]   Man, some great stories in there,
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:19.880]   including the day he wrecked his McLaren.
[00:48:19.880 --> 00:48:21.480]   Elon or Ashley?
[00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:23.600]   No, Elon.
[00:48:23.600 --> 00:48:27.120]   I don't think Ashley has a McLaren.
[00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:30.040]   So non-fiction is doing great, but there's great fiction.
[00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:33.400]   The science fiction selection here is phenomenal.
[00:48:33.400 --> 00:48:35.120]   Audible always has great recommendations.
[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:37.200]   And one thing that's cool about people who love Audible,
[00:48:37.200 --> 00:48:40.600]   when they get together, they always talk.
[00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:43.440]   Jurassic Park, before you see the movie,
[00:48:43.440 --> 00:48:47.120]   re-listen to the novel, I'm really excited about the new movie.
[00:48:47.120 --> 00:48:49.040]   But all the Michael Crichton novels are here.
[00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:50.520]   And really nicely done.
[00:48:50.520 --> 00:48:52.200]   Scott Brick does a great job.
[00:48:52.200 --> 00:48:57.800]   This is a re-record for the 25th anniversary of Jurassic Park.
[00:48:57.800 --> 00:48:58.680]   Audible.com.
[00:48:58.680 --> 00:48:59.600]   Here's how you get two books.
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:00.920]   I've given you a few.
[00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:02.520]   Audible.com/Twit2.
[00:49:02.520 --> 00:49:03.800]   You're signing up for the platinum plan.
[00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:05.880]   That's the book-- two books a month plan.
[00:49:05.880 --> 00:49:08.160]   It includes the Daily Digest of the New York Times
[00:49:08.160 --> 00:49:09.680]   or at the Wall Street Journal.
[00:49:09.680 --> 00:49:12.120]   And you pay nothing for the first 30 days.
[00:49:12.120 --> 00:49:14.200]   Cancel any time in those first 30 days.
[00:49:14.200 --> 00:49:15.960]   Keep those books forever.
[00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:17.160]   You won't want to cancel.
[00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:18.880]   I am a fanatic.
[00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:19.800]   I listened to Audible.
[00:49:19.800 --> 00:49:22.000]   I just got the Amazon Echo.
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:24.280]   That little tube that you talked to.
[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:26.560]   And you can now say, hey, Echo, read me.
[00:49:26.560 --> 00:49:28.400]   And it'll read to you from your Audible collection,
[00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:30.880]   which is amazing.
[00:49:30.880 --> 00:49:37.080]   Audible.com/Twit2, we think, of their support of this week
[00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:38.880]   in tech.
[00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:41.960]   So you think-- boy, I think Merlin,
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:44.320]   we used to talk about this when the Apple TV first
[00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:48.240]   came out on Mac Break Weekly when you were there.
[00:49:48.240 --> 00:49:52.520]   That they will put an app store on the Apple TV?
[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:55.040]   Yeah, it sounds like one of my predictions.
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:57.680]   From eight years ago or whatever.
[00:49:57.680 --> 00:49:57.920]   I got it.
[00:49:57.920 --> 00:50:00.280]   My track record is outstanding.
[00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:02.480]   We're still waiting for that Beatles iPod.
[00:50:02.480 --> 00:50:03.920]   What was that?
[00:50:03.920 --> 00:50:05.280]   The yellow summer iPod?
[00:50:05.280 --> 00:50:06.560]   Yeah, still waiting for that one.
[00:50:06.560 --> 00:50:06.960]   Any day now.
[00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:09.120]   Any day now.
[00:50:09.120 --> 00:50:10.160]   Pawn opener.
[00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:11.400]   I don't think this is anything.
[00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:13.480]   I'm the first person to say any of this stuff.
[00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:15.880]   It's just that it's been so long since the Apple TV
[00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:16.960]   has been updated.
[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:18.840]   And it's really--
[00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:20.640]   I don't know if people have moved on.
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:21.720]   They've gone to Roku.
[00:50:21.720 --> 00:50:23.320]   They've gone to other platforms.
[00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:27.840]   Well, the Amazon Fire TV really does fly.
[00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:29.400]   I love my shield.
[00:50:29.400 --> 00:50:32.280]   And the thing is, when I talk to my friends who have just
[00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:34.360]   an Apple TV, that sounds really crazy.
[00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:36.120]   How could there be a performance difference?
[00:50:36.120 --> 00:50:39.000]   And it's like, well, the fact that it wakes the second you
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:40.120]   hit it, it's crazy.
[00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:42.480]   But anyway, all that aside, it's just that--
[00:50:42.480 --> 00:50:42.800]   I don't know.
[00:50:42.800 --> 00:50:44.680]   I just feel like there's a big opportunity out there
[00:50:44.680 --> 00:50:47.000]   for some kind of a device where I sometimes
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.160]   feel like-- again, I said this on another show recently,
[00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:52.400]   but I feel like sometimes our biggest constraint of mind
[00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:54.840]   is that we call it an Apple TV, where you think of it.
[00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:57.640]   I mean, we came to know this little puck as a way
[00:50:57.640 --> 00:50:59.000]   to buy things on the iTunes.
[00:50:59.000 --> 00:51:00.320]   That's what it's become.
[00:51:00.320 --> 00:51:02.240]   And that's-- I think something different
[00:51:02.240 --> 00:51:03.320]   is going to happen with that.
[00:51:03.320 --> 00:51:05.560]   And maybe it gets mixed in with a router.
[00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:06.760]   Maybe who knows what it could be.
[00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:09.400]   But I guess, if I had any-- you know what?
[00:51:09.400 --> 00:51:11.640]   It's been a while since I've done a really dumb prediction
[00:51:11.640 --> 00:51:12.480]   on a Twitch show.
[00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:13.400]   Let's do it.
[00:51:13.400 --> 00:51:14.960]   My dumb prediction is going to be that they're
[00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:17.640]   going to have an amazing pivot in the next two years,
[00:51:17.640 --> 00:51:20.080]   where they-- their company that has typically said,
[00:51:20.080 --> 00:51:22.040]   we'll take it in the shorts on content in order
[00:51:22.040 --> 00:51:23.120]   to make it up in hardware.
[00:51:23.120 --> 00:51:24.360]   There's a part of me that wonders
[00:51:24.360 --> 00:51:26.200]   if they'll take it in the shorts on hardware
[00:51:26.200 --> 00:51:27.600]   in order to make it up on content.
[00:51:27.600 --> 00:51:30.560]   When it comes to things like movies and apps.
[00:51:30.560 --> 00:51:32.680]   So I would love to see a feature in two years
[00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:34.200]   where you could walk into a Walgreens
[00:51:34.200 --> 00:51:36.200]   and pick up whatever replaces the Apple TV,
[00:51:36.200 --> 00:51:38.680]   take it with you anywhere, have a service that's portable.
[00:51:38.680 --> 00:51:39.920]   Like Mariah, for example.
[00:51:39.920 --> 00:51:41.280]   Mariah just announced the service
[00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:43.720]   where you can get your Netflix inside your room.
[00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:45.560]   You know, if they really are going to move this stuff
[00:51:45.560 --> 00:51:47.760]   into the cloud, the Apple TV just
[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:50.800]   becomes the way that it gets from the tube onto your TV.
[00:51:50.800 --> 00:51:53.320]   But that up store becomes so important in that scenario.
[00:51:53.320 --> 00:51:57.000]   That said, having a device where you could do home kit stuff
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:58.320]   would just be giant.
[00:51:58.320 --> 00:51:59.960]   It just seems like the most obvious thing in the world.
[00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:03.600]   So if any like one or two of those things
[00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:06.200]   are what was planned or what is being planned
[00:52:06.200 --> 00:52:08.800]   for the Apple TV, I'm not surprised that it's taken awhile
[00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:11.120]   'cause that's a whole lot of stuff in a company
[00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:13.160]   that has not done great with services in the past.
[00:52:13.160 --> 00:52:14.160]   So--
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:15.000]   - By the way, that's--
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:15.840]   - It gets up, by the way,
[00:52:15.840 --> 00:52:17.040]   prediction, everything's gonna change.
[00:52:17.040 --> 00:52:19.320]   - They dropped at 69, which was, I think,
[00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:21.960]   because they were gonna clear it out, right?
[00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:23.120]   - That's what we all thought, yeah.
[00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:25.080]   - Sounds like they might've thought they were about
[00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:27.360]   to announce it too and had to delay it a little bit.
[00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:28.840]   - That's all right, they could do it next month.
[00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:30.760]   - Couple weeks ago, a couple weeks ago,
[00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:35.200]   less Moonves, the head of the US was talking about how,
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:37.440]   yes, we are actually talking to Apple.
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:39.440]   He was at the Code Conference, and that was supposed to be--
[00:52:39.440 --> 00:52:40.280]   - He seemed excited.
[00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:41.120]   He wanted to do it again.
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:41.960]   - He said he was happy.
[00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:44.440]   He said, basically, it's just about money right now.
[00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:46.360]   So they're just negotiating about who, you know,
[00:52:46.360 --> 00:52:49.320]   how much they get paid is what it sounded like.
[00:52:49.320 --> 00:52:52.440]   - Well, it is kind of the bottom line, isn't it?
[00:52:52.440 --> 00:52:53.280]   I mean--
[00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:54.760]   (laughing)
[00:52:54.760 --> 00:52:57.040]   - It's just one little detail to take care of, which is--
[00:52:57.040 --> 00:52:59.640]   - That's the only thing Les' job really is to do,
[00:52:59.640 --> 00:53:01.640]   is make sure that the money's there.
[00:53:01.640 --> 00:53:03.360]   - Yes, how many billions are you gonna give us?
[00:53:03.360 --> 00:53:05.880]   - Speaking of which, I'm stunned by what you just told us,
[00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:09.120]   Merlin, that Marriott, which makes a ton of money
[00:53:09.120 --> 00:53:11.800]   on in-room entertainment, mostly porno,
[00:53:11.800 --> 00:53:14.200]   is gonna let you watch your Netflix.
[00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:17.760]   They must've been forced to do that.
[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:19.840]   There's no way, I mean, they're giving up,
[00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:24.520]   why would I ever rent a $20 movie on the Marriott?
[00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:27.440]   - Well, maybe the revenues from the movies
[00:53:27.440 --> 00:53:30.200]   are disappearing because of the internet in the hotel room.
[00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:31.040]   - Oh, it's killing the internet.
[00:53:31.040 --> 00:53:31.880]   - And now they're trying to figure out a way
[00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:34.680]   to make people more loyal to their brand.
[00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:35.520]   - Okay.
[00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:36.640]   - Well, have you read any of the articles
[00:53:36.640 --> 00:53:40.280]   about how many hotels are not doing mini bars
[00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:42.760]   and in their rooms anymore?
[00:53:42.760 --> 00:53:43.600]   - Why isn't it?
[00:53:43.600 --> 00:53:46.000]   - I've read a couple of things about it.
[00:53:46.000 --> 00:53:47.120]   I forget, I forget me, I don't remember
[00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:48.440]   where I read a big piece on this,
[00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:50.440]   but I've been surprised too, that more and more stuff,
[00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:52.320]   you know-- - It's just an NC refrigerator.
[00:53:52.320 --> 00:53:53.920]   Sometimes I've not even turned on.
[00:53:53.920 --> 00:53:56.440]   - But basically land buying in the hotel room anymore.
[00:53:56.440 --> 00:53:58.160]   I hardly turn on the TV at all,
[00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:00.400]   I just use my better laptop.
[00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:02.320]   - But somebody wrote this comprehensive history
[00:54:02.320 --> 00:54:04.880]   of the mini bar and what's happened to it over the years.
[00:54:04.880 --> 00:54:07.000]   And how did that, I want to read?
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:08.080]   It was fascinating, it was pretty sharp.
[00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:10.200]   - It must've been on medium.
[00:54:10.200 --> 00:54:12.000]   As you know, yeah, you've certainly done the thing
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:13.560]   where you're like, oh, do I want this?
[00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:15.240]   And you move it around and you get charged.
[00:54:15.240 --> 00:54:17.520]   But basically the idea is that it's not nearly
[00:54:17.520 --> 00:54:18.920]   as profitable as you would guess.
[00:54:18.920 --> 00:54:20.400]   It takes a lot of resources.
[00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:22.960]   I mean, hotels are pretty under resourced
[00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:24.000]   in a lot of ways.
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:25.080]   It's very costly to keep up.
[00:54:25.080 --> 00:54:26.320]   They lose a lot of money on it.
[00:54:26.320 --> 00:54:28.480]   They have, they end up having to give a lot of money back
[00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:29.960]   on refunds and stuff like that.
[00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:31.440]   I guess what I'm wondering is like,
[00:54:31.440 --> 00:54:33.440]   it seems like selling movies in a room
[00:54:33.440 --> 00:54:36.360]   would be pure profit, but maybe the margins on that
[00:54:36.360 --> 00:54:37.360]   are not that great. - Right.
[00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:39.680]   Well, the systems were always really clunky
[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:41.880]   and always almost always third party.
[00:54:41.880 --> 00:54:43.160]   But it's funny, like I did a quick search
[00:54:43.160 --> 00:54:47.320]   of 2000 time, 2010 LA Times article,
[00:54:47.320 --> 00:54:49.160]   talking about how hotel revenue from phone calls
[00:54:49.160 --> 00:54:51.720]   and in-room movies was drying up.
[00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:52.960]   Here's the economists. - Because none of us
[00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:53.800]   were bringing their own to business.
[00:54:53.800 --> 00:54:57.200]   - Mini Bar Blues writes the economist.
[00:54:57.200 --> 00:54:58.360]   Unfortunately, I can't read it
[00:54:58.360 --> 00:55:00.680]   because I have to see an ad from Rolex first.
[00:55:00.680 --> 00:55:02.480]   Here we go, hold on.
[00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:04.200]   Well, if you're reading the economist,
[00:55:04.200 --> 00:55:07.240]   you're obviously gonna have won to vie and watch.
[00:55:07.240 --> 00:55:08.760]   The hotel mini bar, the last refuge
[00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:10.480]   of many of a tired emotional business traveler
[00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:12.080]   is in its twilight years.
[00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:12.920]   - Wow.
[00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:15.720]   Hotels aren't even charging for wifi
[00:55:15.720 --> 00:55:16.880]   nearly as much as I used to.
[00:55:16.880 --> 00:55:18.200]   A lot of the time that's just being rolled
[00:55:18.200 --> 00:55:19.160]   into the cost of the room.
[00:55:19.160 --> 00:55:20.400]   - I think that's increasingly,
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:21.760]   that's gonna be table sticks,
[00:55:21.760 --> 00:55:23.960]   which seems improbable.
[00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:25.720]   It wasn't so long, it was $30 a day
[00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:27.360]   for one device to connect.
[00:55:27.360 --> 00:55:28.760]   That seems like two years ago to me.
[00:55:28.760 --> 00:55:30.160]   - As beef in our chatroom says,
[00:55:30.160 --> 00:55:32.080]   it's pretty sad when a company can't make a profit
[00:55:32.080 --> 00:55:33.680]   of that $10 bag of peanuts.
[00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:38.080]   Or a $25 day of wifi.
[00:55:38.080 --> 00:55:40.360]   Obviously there's overhead, I didn't understand.
[00:55:40.360 --> 00:55:42.880]   - It's funny, like this LA Times article,
[00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:44.960]   revenue collected by US hotels from phone calls
[00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:47.960]   dropped to an average of $178 per room in 2009
[00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:51.560]   from 1252 in 1999.
[00:55:51.560 --> 00:55:53.240]   So an 86% drop.
[00:55:53.240 --> 00:55:55.760]   - Part of the problem is theft.
[00:55:55.760 --> 00:55:59.240]   Customers drink the booze in the little bottles
[00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:01.000]   and replace it with water.
[00:56:01.000 --> 00:56:02.400]   Who knew?
[00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:04.600]   - So then what they did was,
[00:56:04.600 --> 00:56:06.880]   I remember when they started doing this as a drinker,
[00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:08.200]   when they started making it so that
[00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:10.040]   if you even move the thing,
[00:56:10.040 --> 00:56:11.400]   they would charge you.
[00:56:11.400 --> 00:56:12.360]   And if you don't check your bill,
[00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:13.600]   people don't check the bill
[00:56:13.600 --> 00:56:15.040]   and they'll be all the stuff on there
[00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:16.520]   and they had to do all these G's chargebacks.
[00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:18.080]   Anyway, once again, there's a reason
[00:56:18.080 --> 00:56:19.680]   I am not in the corner office.
[00:56:19.680 --> 00:56:24.200]   But I mean, I think that it feels like the industry,
[00:56:24.200 --> 00:56:25.760]   there's always ways they're trying to make a buck,
[00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:28.840]   but more and more as an occasional traveler,
[00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:30.840]   it feels like they're really trying to save money.
[00:56:30.840 --> 00:56:32.800]   Like if there's not a clear winner
[00:56:32.800 --> 00:56:34.440]   and a way to make pure profit,
[00:56:34.440 --> 00:56:36.440]   it's really more about minimizing costs.
[00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:37.720]   Like, have you noticed,
[00:56:37.720 --> 00:56:39.160]   I sound like Jerry Seinfeld.
[00:56:39.160 --> 00:56:40.680]   What's the deal with garbage cans?
[00:56:40.680 --> 00:56:41.560]   Is it just me or like,
[00:56:41.560 --> 00:56:43.960]   is there like one tiny garbage can for the entire room?
[00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:45.360]   - There is, that is a shot.
[00:56:45.360 --> 00:56:46.200]   - Well, there must be a reason.
[00:56:46.200 --> 00:56:47.640]   I bet there's an economic reason for that.
[00:56:47.640 --> 00:56:48.760]   They probably don't want,
[00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:50.360]   they want to clean that room and flip it around
[00:56:50.360 --> 00:56:52.920]   as soon as possible because that means fewer staff.
[00:56:52.920 --> 00:56:55.720]   You know, I don't think hotels do as well as it seems.
[00:56:55.720 --> 00:56:57.520]   Anyway, I don't know how it's about hotels, but.
[00:56:57.520 --> 00:56:59.480]   - They're looking at replacing the housekeeping staff
[00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:01.080]   with robots and literally,
[00:57:01.080 --> 00:57:02.480]   - There's a hotel in Silicon Valley
[00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:04.480]   where the little robot comes and brings you your--
[00:57:04.480 --> 00:57:05.400]   - You call for a toothbrush,
[00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:06.240]   your robot comes up with them.
[00:57:06.240 --> 00:57:07.240]   - Yeah.
[00:57:07.240 --> 00:57:08.920]   Well, just like the smaller hotels in Vegas.
[00:57:08.920 --> 00:57:11.320]   - That doesn't seem like a cost saving by the way.
[00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:12.360]   (laughing)
[00:57:12.360 --> 00:57:14.520]   - Well, it depends on the, it's funny though,
[00:57:14.520 --> 00:57:15.680]   but for the larger hotels,
[00:57:15.680 --> 00:57:18.000]   it's a big deal for the smaller hotels in Vegas.
[00:57:18.000 --> 00:57:19.440]   It turns out like they,
[00:57:19.440 --> 00:57:21.280]   the people are brought in their independent contractors
[00:57:21.280 --> 00:57:25.960]   and if they step into your room and give you towels,
[00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:27.560]   they make like $3.
[00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:29.360]   If they're not allowed in the room, they make nothing.
[00:57:29.360 --> 00:57:30.920]   And there's a-- - Oh, the ones that man.
[00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:33.040]   - There's a person watching and queuing them
[00:57:33.040 --> 00:57:34.760]   to see which room they go into.
[00:57:34.760 --> 00:57:36.360]   In the case of the larger hotels,
[00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:37.920]   when you have in Vegas,
[00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:40.480]   it'll go from 80% occupancy during CES
[00:57:40.480 --> 00:57:43.640]   and maybe spend 80% of its time at 20% occupancy,
[00:57:43.640 --> 00:57:45.840]   keeping staff online for that is a nightmare.
[00:57:45.840 --> 00:57:48.160]   So in that case, robots may actually be less expensive
[00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:49.520]   and robots don't expect retirement.
[00:57:49.520 --> 00:57:52.160]   They don't have health insurance policies.
[00:57:52.160 --> 00:57:53.320]   You know, it's-- - Usually.
[00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:54.160]   - Yeah.
[00:57:54.160 --> 00:57:55.480]   But I bet the tiny garbage cans
[00:57:55.480 --> 00:57:58.160]   is probably about minimizing the amount they pay,
[00:57:58.160 --> 00:58:00.400]   just 'cause people, I've walked into a hotel room
[00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:01.640]   with somebody had like emptied out
[00:58:01.640 --> 00:58:03.520]   the back of their entire truck into the garbage cans.
[00:58:03.520 --> 00:58:04.360]   - Well, that's why I thought-- - The garbage cans.
[00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:05.240]   - This is pile in the corner. - That's why I think
[00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:07.480]   you would want garbage cans to encourage people
[00:58:07.480 --> 00:58:10.240]   to take the trash and put it in a garbage can.
[00:58:10.240 --> 00:58:11.880]   If you don't give me enough garbage cans,
[00:58:11.880 --> 00:58:13.560]   I'm gonna leave it on the floor.
[00:58:13.560 --> 00:58:14.400]   (laughing)
[00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:16.040]   - You know, I had the same thought.
[00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:17.200]   We have a park near our house.
[00:58:17.200 --> 00:58:19.120]   And one day I ran into the inscrutable woman
[00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:20.400]   who takes care of the park.
[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:22.400]   And I said, "Incrutable woman,
[00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:25.000]   "why do we not have more garbage cans here in the park?"
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:26.840]   Because it seems to me that all the high school kids
[00:58:26.840 --> 00:58:29.040]   who are monsters throw all their trash
[00:58:29.040 --> 00:58:31.480]   and they just wish her sweet things on the ground.
[00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:35.520]   Wouldn't it be, you know, like a nice thing for the park
[00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:36.880]   if we had more garbage cans,
[00:58:36.880 --> 00:58:40.000]   leave them on the path, people can put the garbage in them.
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:43.360]   And she goes, "F, no, we just have to empty those."
[00:58:43.360 --> 00:58:45.880]   (laughing)
[00:58:45.880 --> 00:58:48.480]   - The city gets the switcher sweet stuff.
[00:58:48.480 --> 00:58:49.960]   - There's a reason I'm not on city council.
[00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:50.880]   It seems to me that I'll be easier
[00:58:50.880 --> 00:58:52.480]   than picking it up off the ground later.
[00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:54.200]   - But thinking, I'm just thinking.
[00:58:54.200 --> 00:58:55.760]   - I think you should be a solution here.
[00:58:55.760 --> 00:58:58.160]   - Crazy. - It seems to be awesome.
[00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:00.440]   - So no, I think I missed a step here.
[00:59:00.440 --> 00:59:02.880]   What is Apple doing to disrupt the hotel industry?
[00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:04.960]   - I don't know how we got, you know, Dylan,
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:07.280]   you're new here, so let me explain.
[00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:09.960]   - Imagine it's Johnny Ive in a white room.
[00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:11.000]   (laughing)
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:12.560]   We have taken everything you love
[00:59:12.560 --> 00:59:15.200]   about your home trash can and a tram for that.
[00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:16.480]   - The simplest hotel.
[00:59:16.480 --> 00:59:17.880]   - The world's tiniest trash can.
[00:59:17.880 --> 00:59:19.040]   - We've ever made it.
[00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:20.040]   We've made it slimmer.
[00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:24.360]   - Dylan, the problem really with the show in general
[00:59:24.360 --> 00:59:27.960]   is that we all are massively suffering from ADD,
[00:59:27.960 --> 00:59:29.800]   and we haven't taken our meds.
[00:59:29.800 --> 00:59:31.760]   So you never know where we're gonna go.
[00:59:31.760 --> 00:59:35.320]   In fact, Merlin, I think you invented the rat hole.
[00:59:35.320 --> 00:59:37.240]   - Yeah, that was me.
[00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:39.500]   (laughing)
[00:59:40.100 --> 00:59:41.100]   - Wait a minute, here he goes.
[00:59:41.100 --> 00:59:43.980]   The rat hole theme, ladies and gentlemen, everybody.
[00:59:43.980 --> 00:59:46.140]   (gentle music)
[00:59:46.140 --> 00:59:48.020]   ♪ Rat hole ♪
[00:59:48.020 --> 00:59:50.500]   (laughing)
[00:59:50.500 --> 00:59:51.960]   - I have a recording of that somewhere.
[00:59:51.960 --> 00:59:54.660]   Thank you, Merlin, and it wouldn't be the same without you.
[00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:56.440]   All right, this is another rat hole,
[00:59:56.440 --> 00:59:58.740]   but I think an interesting one.
[00:59:58.740 --> 01:00:00.740]   The market, I think it's the market,
[01:00:00.740 --> 01:00:02.780]   has slowly been eating away at Twitter,
[01:00:02.780 --> 01:00:05.940]   first a foot, then a thigh, then another hand.
[01:00:05.940 --> 01:00:08.180]   They've scapegoated every executive,
[01:00:08.180 --> 01:00:09.900]   finally got to the head office.
[01:00:09.900 --> 01:00:12.220]   The CEO, Dick Costolo, who's well beloved.
[01:00:12.220 --> 01:00:13.740]   I think you probably know him, Merlin,
[01:00:13.740 --> 01:00:15.500]   funny guy, talented.
[01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:16.620]   - Everybody seems to like him.
[01:00:16.620 --> 01:00:17.780]   - Everybody. - Except for Wall Street.
[01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:19.500]   - Wall Street didn't like him,
[01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:21.540]   and bye-bye, Dick Costolo.
[01:00:21.540 --> 01:00:25.500]   He's no longer gonna be the CEO, Jack Dorsey's coming back.
[01:00:25.500 --> 01:00:28.580]   Jack's like a bad penny, you cannot get rid of him.
[01:00:28.580 --> 01:00:31.940]   Until they find another CEO, right?
[01:00:31.940 --> 01:00:32.780]   Or wrong?
[01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:36.060]   - Steve Jobs was the interim CEO at Apple
[01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:37.260]   for like several years. - That's true.
[01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:38.340]   - If I remember correctly.
[01:00:38.340 --> 01:00:40.220]   - Jack was been the CEO before.
[01:00:40.220 --> 01:00:41.820]   Remember he was going back and forth
[01:00:41.820 --> 01:00:44.260]   between his startup Square,
[01:00:44.260 --> 01:00:46.940]   and like in one day he'd do half a day at Square,
[01:00:46.940 --> 01:00:48.100]   and half a day at Square.
[01:00:48.100 --> 01:00:49.980]   - They're in buildings right next to each other.
[01:00:49.980 --> 01:00:52.180]   Market straight. - He's still doing that.
[01:00:52.180 --> 01:00:54.900]   He's really taking this being like Steve Jobs thing,
[01:00:54.900 --> 01:00:55.740]   really weighty.
[01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:57.660]   (laughing)
[01:00:57.660 --> 01:00:58.980]   - So what for the beard?
[01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:01.860]   Steve would never have let his beard grow that long.
[01:01:01.860 --> 01:01:04.060]   - Yeah, Jack, the beard.
[01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:06.500]   I hadn't seen the beard until this news came out.
[01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:08.580]   - You see his mom complaining about the beard on Twitter?
[01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:09.420]   - No.
[01:01:09.420 --> 01:01:12.140]   - She didn't like it 'cause he has such a nice face.
[01:01:12.140 --> 01:01:14.500]   - Aw, he has such a nice plenum.
[01:01:14.500 --> 01:01:16.100]   I have a feeling they're probably,
[01:01:16.100 --> 01:01:16.940]   and I'm just gonna check,
[01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:20.980]   is a Jack Dorsey's beard account on Twitter right now.
[01:01:20.980 --> 01:01:24.180]   You know, you probably know all the players, Marlon.
[01:01:24.180 --> 01:01:26.340]   I think you were a very early adopter
[01:01:26.340 --> 01:01:28.380]   and very tightly the Twitter group.
[01:01:28.380 --> 01:01:29.700]   - I'm so deeply out of the loop.
[01:01:29.700 --> 01:01:33.500]   I did a talk at Twitter about meetings.
[01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:36.020]   You can find somewhere on the internet.
[01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:37.540]   Probably about two, three years ago.
[01:01:37.540 --> 01:01:39.420]   And I remember going in there and I was talking like,
[01:01:39.420 --> 01:01:40.620]   "Yeah, so this must be really crazy."
[01:01:40.620 --> 01:01:41.580]   Like, you know, really difficult.
[01:01:41.580 --> 01:01:42.580]   You're growing like, "Yeah, yeah."
[01:01:42.580 --> 01:01:44.820]   Like in January, we had 150 people
[01:01:44.820 --> 01:01:47.020]   and then in that fall they had 300 people.
[01:01:47.020 --> 01:01:49.420]   And now today, I mean, how many did you guys follow this?
[01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:50.260]   How much do they have?
[01:01:50.260 --> 01:01:51.980]   How many people do they have today?
[01:01:51.980 --> 01:01:53.340]   - I don't know, a Twitter?
[01:01:53.340 --> 01:01:55.060]   You think it's smaller than it was?
[01:01:55.060 --> 01:01:56.540]   - I worked in the same building as Twitter
[01:01:56.540 --> 01:01:59.220]   and in the building as just vast numbers of people.
[01:01:59.220 --> 01:02:01.580]   There were 30 people, an amazing, a long time.
[01:02:01.580 --> 01:02:02.420]   - Yeah.
[01:02:02.420 --> 01:02:03.340]   - Yeah.
[01:02:03.340 --> 01:02:06.660]   - So I don't feel like Dick did anything wrong.
[01:02:06.660 --> 01:02:09.780]   In fact, to me, he was of all the CEOs,
[01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:13.380]   the one who was most interactive with his users.
[01:02:13.380 --> 01:02:14.740]   It was most forthright.
[01:02:14.740 --> 01:02:16.100]   He was the guy who wrote the memo,
[01:02:16.100 --> 01:02:17.700]   said, "We screwed up.
[01:02:17.700 --> 01:02:20.940]   "We're gonna do better when harassment became a problem."
[01:02:20.940 --> 01:02:23.140]   Thanks to Robin Williams' daughter,
[01:02:23.140 --> 01:02:25.700]   who was basically chased from Twitter.
[01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:27.980]   He said, "That's our fault and we're gonna fix it."
[01:02:27.980 --> 01:02:30.620]   And I admired it for that.
[01:02:30.620 --> 01:02:33.220]   Wall Street's problem is that Twitter's not growing.
[01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:34.820]   As fast as it used to.
[01:02:34.820 --> 01:02:35.660]   They want it to be Facebook.
[01:02:35.660 --> 01:02:37.140]   - And it's not making money.
[01:02:37.140 --> 01:02:37.980]   - Yeah.
[01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:38.820]   - It's losing money.
[01:02:38.820 --> 01:02:40.260]   I mean, that's the real issue.
[01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:42.180]   Twitter's actually growing pretty quickly
[01:02:42.180 --> 01:02:44.980]   and it's doing, in terms of sheer metrics,
[01:02:44.980 --> 01:02:49.140]   it's not bad for being a distant number two to Facebook.
[01:02:49.140 --> 01:02:51.380]   But in terms of revenue, I mean, the question is,
[01:02:51.380 --> 01:02:53.820]   they could be making so much more money.
[01:02:53.820 --> 01:02:56.380]   They could be doing such a better job of engaging people
[01:02:56.380 --> 01:02:58.700]   and keeping them sticking around.
[01:02:58.700 --> 01:03:01.300]   And I think Wall Street is just like,
[01:03:01.300 --> 01:03:05.740]   we've had too many lackluster quarters.
[01:03:05.740 --> 01:03:07.860]   And we've had enough.
[01:03:07.860 --> 01:03:10.300]   - By the way, here's the Jack Dorsey's beard account.
[01:03:10.300 --> 01:03:13.900]   It really does exist.
[01:03:13.900 --> 01:03:15.660]   But it's funny because it feels like Twitter
[01:03:15.660 --> 01:03:18.980]   has kind of cracked the monetization nut.
[01:03:18.980 --> 01:03:21.780]   They've got these promoted accounts.
[01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:23.580]   They've got, I see an ad now,
[01:03:23.580 --> 01:03:25.300]   every time I look at Twitter on the web,
[01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:29.060]   I see this is a New York Times promoted tweet.
[01:03:29.060 --> 01:03:30.700]   So that's an ad.
[01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:31.940]   Why can't they monetize?
[01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:33.780]   They seem like they have a very kind of
[01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:36.180]   a great monetization strategy.
[01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:39.300]   - They can't monetize as well as what if you measure
[01:03:39.300 --> 01:03:42.060]   their users in billions rather than hundreds of millions?
[01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:44.380]   - I see, they're just not big enough.
[01:03:44.380 --> 01:03:45.460]   - Yeah.
[01:03:45.460 --> 01:03:47.980]   - Well, if you even Instagram is bigger, right?
[01:03:47.980 --> 01:03:51.180]   Go ahead, Dylan.
[01:03:51.180 --> 01:03:52.500]   - Yeah, no, I think that's it.
[01:03:52.500 --> 01:03:55.740]   I mean, they're almost overdoing it in promoted tweets.
[01:03:55.740 --> 01:03:57.500]   I see way too many in my stream.
[01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:59.580]   I think the issue they have is one with engagement
[01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:01.780]   and just getting people to stick around and to come back.
[01:04:01.780 --> 01:04:04.700]   And Chris Sokka, who's one of their big shareholders,
[01:04:04.700 --> 01:04:06.860]   one of their big investors from early on,
[01:04:06.860 --> 01:04:11.860]   penned this gigantic 10,000 word essay this week
[01:04:11.860 --> 01:04:14.340]   about all the things that Twitter could do better.
[01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:17.140]   And it's way too long, but his point is that
[01:04:17.140 --> 01:04:18.980]   they could do much better engagement
[01:04:18.980 --> 01:04:21.660]   and at sort of building around events, right?
[01:04:21.660 --> 01:04:24.140]   So like you're watching the Warriors play,
[01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:26.740]   you know, the Cavs in the NBA finals.
[01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:28.740]   And like, if you wanna actually do that right now,
[01:04:28.740 --> 01:04:30.940]   you have to figure out which hashtags to follow.
[01:04:30.940 --> 01:04:32.660]   You have to like, there's a handful of them.
[01:04:32.660 --> 01:04:34.700]   There's some key accounts you have to follow.
[01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:36.580]   You have to set it all up and you have to kind of be
[01:04:36.580 --> 01:04:40.180]   a power user to actually make use of what's going on
[01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:43.180]   on Twitter around a sporting event, right?
[01:04:43.180 --> 01:04:47.300]   And so they could way easily put together these channels
[01:04:47.300 --> 01:04:48.420]   where people could just be like,
[01:04:48.420 --> 01:04:50.100]   hey, the playoffs are on tonight.
[01:04:50.100 --> 01:04:52.940]   Let me, you know, follow this channel on Twitter
[01:04:52.940 --> 01:04:56.500]   while I'm watching the game and it will enrich the experience.
[01:04:56.500 --> 01:04:58.900]   And they just haven't done a lot of that kind of thing
[01:04:58.900 --> 01:05:01.300]   to bring people in and get them engaged
[01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:03.420]   who are not power users like, you know,
[01:05:03.420 --> 01:05:05.740]   like all of us talking right here, right?
[01:05:05.740 --> 01:05:09.620]   - It's funny, I was talking today on the radio show
[01:05:09.620 --> 01:05:13.420]   about when you have a kid, you should do a Google search
[01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:15.780]   on the proposed name to make sure that you get
[01:05:15.780 --> 01:05:16.900]   a unique enough name.
[01:05:16.900 --> 01:05:19.460]   You should probably create a Gmail account
[01:05:19.460 --> 01:05:21.660]   in that person's, in that new name,
[01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:22.740]   a website in that new name.
[01:05:22.740 --> 01:05:24.660]   And then I wondered, well, should you get
[01:05:24.660 --> 01:05:27.020]   that kid's Twitter handle just proactively?
[01:05:27.020 --> 01:05:30.420]   'Cause will Twitter be around in 10, 20 years?
[01:05:30.420 --> 01:05:32.380]   And I don't think so.
[01:05:32.380 --> 01:05:33.860]   I don't feel like it will, will it?
[01:05:33.860 --> 01:05:35.980]   Facebook will, Google will.
[01:05:35.980 --> 01:05:36.980]   - I don't know about that.
[01:05:36.980 --> 01:05:38.580]   - Google will. - Will Twitter?
[01:05:38.580 --> 01:05:41.500]   - There are rumors that can be passed
[01:05:41.500 --> 01:05:43.060]   - I think they will probably be required.
[01:05:43.060 --> 01:05:43.900]   - By Google.
[01:05:43.900 --> 01:05:44.740]   - They're by Google.
[01:05:44.740 --> 01:05:48.220]   - Which doesn't mean they'll shut it down, but.
[01:05:48.220 --> 01:05:50.660]   - It seems like that would be a bad thing.
[01:05:50.660 --> 01:05:52.460]   But if you're a fan of Twitter.
[01:05:52.460 --> 01:05:54.740]   - But it's a sign that people don't see Twitter
[01:05:54.740 --> 01:05:56.540]   or something that's gonna just grow and grow
[01:05:56.540 --> 01:05:58.500]   and thrive and thrive indefinitely.
[01:05:58.500 --> 01:06:00.460]   - Well, I mean, there's a lot of things
[01:06:00.460 --> 01:06:01.300]   I love about Twitter.
[01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:04.180]   It's a great way to interact with the audience.
[01:06:04.180 --> 01:06:06.700]   It's an interesting way to interact with friends.
[01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:09.180]   It has never generated click-throughs
[01:06:09.180 --> 01:06:10.620]   in any significant way.
[01:06:10.620 --> 01:06:11.460]   - Oh, that's true.
[01:06:11.460 --> 01:06:13.180]   So when you put a link or a show up on Twitter,
[01:06:13.180 --> 01:06:14.180]   no value. - No.
[01:06:14.180 --> 01:06:15.060]   - Interesting.
[01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:15.900]   - No.
[01:06:15.900 --> 01:06:18.100]   - Is that 'cause of a lack of engagement or?
[01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:19.780]   - Well, it's partially, once you start following
[01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:22.420]   a bunch of people, things start flying by so fast.
[01:06:22.420 --> 01:06:27.420]   And also a lot of Twitter is when you build a 140 character
[01:06:27.420 --> 01:06:31.300]   cap into everything, you tend to have the world's
[01:06:31.300 --> 01:06:32.420]   shortest attention span.
[01:06:32.420 --> 01:06:34.220]   Why would you click on the link to get the article
[01:06:34.220 --> 01:06:36.900]   if somebody's done an unbelievably clever 140 character
[01:06:36.900 --> 01:06:40.500]   spiel that encapsulates the rest of the 3000 word screed?
[01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:44.580]   It's a peculiar environment to try to make,
[01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:49.100]   to use for as a promotional tool or a tool to drive use.
[01:06:49.100 --> 01:06:50.580]   - That's a structural problem though.
[01:06:50.580 --> 01:06:52.580]   What are you gonna do that can fix that?
[01:06:52.580 --> 01:06:55.140]   I mean, you're kind of tied to 140 characters.
[01:06:55.140 --> 01:06:58.380]   - Which brings us back to the idea of them being bought
[01:06:58.380 --> 01:06:59.660]   and integrated into something else,
[01:06:59.660 --> 01:07:01.980]   but hopefully not becoming the next orchid.
[01:07:01.980 --> 01:07:03.380]   - Or the next Google Plus.
[01:07:03.380 --> 01:07:04.820]   - It kind of feel like plumbing to me.
[01:07:04.820 --> 01:07:08.180]   I mean, me Twitter is like, it's like sort of not sexy,
[01:07:08.180 --> 01:07:09.140]   but very essential.
[01:07:09.140 --> 01:07:12.260]   It's sort of like almost the plumbing of the social layer
[01:07:12.260 --> 01:07:13.100]   of the internet.
[01:07:13.100 --> 01:07:15.340]   And in that way, I think it may be around for a long time
[01:07:15.340 --> 01:07:19.100]   if Twitter plays it right, either by itself
[01:07:19.100 --> 01:07:20.460]   or as part of another company.
[01:07:20.460 --> 01:07:22.140]   - That's what we used to say when it first started.
[01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:23.820]   It was the internet's dial tone almost.
[01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:27.700]   It was the carrier that carried the conversations
[01:07:27.700 --> 01:07:28.580]   on the internet.
[01:07:28.580 --> 01:07:30.380]   And I have to say, I still to this day,
[01:07:30.380 --> 01:07:33.940]   if somebody dies, if there's a story breaking,
[01:07:33.940 --> 01:07:35.780]   I go to Twitter weirdly enough.
[01:07:35.780 --> 01:07:38.140]   Maybe that's just 'cause it's a habit,
[01:07:38.140 --> 01:07:40.100]   but I go right to Twitter.
[01:07:40.100 --> 01:07:41.100]   That's where the conversation--
[01:07:41.100 --> 01:07:42.060]   - I'm standing for breaking news.
[01:07:42.060 --> 01:07:42.900]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[01:07:42.900 --> 01:07:43.740]   - That's standing for that.
[01:07:43.740 --> 01:07:45.700]   - Now you don't stay there, you don't get it.
[01:07:45.700 --> 01:07:47.140]   But if you wanna know what's going on,
[01:07:47.140 --> 01:07:49.940]   when Ferguson was hot, Twitter was where it was,
[01:07:49.940 --> 01:07:51.900]   you would find out about it.
[01:07:51.900 --> 01:07:53.060]   Probably better than CNN.
[01:07:53.060 --> 01:07:56.180]   In fact, for a long time, CNN would just report Twitter
[01:07:56.180 --> 01:07:59.780]   until they got anything better, until AP had it.
[01:07:59.780 --> 01:08:03.940]   Well, that would be sad.
[01:08:03.940 --> 01:08:06.340]   I mean, I don't know why I so closely associate you
[01:08:06.340 --> 01:08:08.540]   with Twitter, Merlin, but I do.
[01:08:08.540 --> 01:08:11.060]   - Well, I was a, I was a, well,
[01:08:11.060 --> 01:08:12.980]   originally I was a very early adopter.
[01:08:12.980 --> 01:08:13.820]   - Yeah. - I mean, I was--
[01:08:13.820 --> 01:08:14.660]   - You weren't in it before anybody.
[01:08:14.660 --> 01:08:17.460]   - I was, yeah, I mean, I was one of the very, very first users.
[01:08:17.460 --> 01:08:19.340]   And then I demanded they take my,
[01:08:19.340 --> 01:08:22.500]   this is back when it was just texts and SMS.
[01:08:22.500 --> 01:08:24.180]   And I was getting SMS's at five in the morning
[01:08:24.180 --> 01:08:25.180]   about somebody's great and run.
[01:08:25.180 --> 01:08:27.260]   And I was like, ah, to be out of this.
[01:08:27.260 --> 01:08:30.100]   That's back when it was just Twitter.
[01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:31.140]   No, I've enjoyed it a lot.
[01:08:31.140 --> 01:08:32.460]   I've met a lot of really good friends to it.
[01:08:32.460 --> 01:08:34.020]   And I don't have anything really to offer here,
[01:08:34.020 --> 01:08:36.420]   except the most obvious kinds of observations,
[01:08:36.420 --> 01:08:39.940]   which is, you know, what makes Twitter great
[01:08:39.940 --> 01:08:43.660]   is all the stuff that you can easily corrupt by trying to,
[01:08:43.660 --> 01:08:46.020]   I'm not, I don't wanna say by trying to make money with it,
[01:08:46.020 --> 01:08:47.460]   but there's so many things where even just
[01:08:47.460 --> 01:08:49.380]   a teeniest bit of corruption
[01:08:49.380 --> 01:08:50.860]   about the simplicity of Twitter
[01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:54.100]   totally screws up huge aspects of why people like it.
[01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:56.180]   I mean, I think, I think the thing that has made Twitter
[01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:59.380]   Twitter are just the fact that rules are simple, right?
[01:08:59.380 --> 01:09:00.820]   You get 140 characters.
[01:09:00.820 --> 01:09:01.820]   And of course that's changed.
[01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:04.100]   Now there's cards and there's different stuff in and out of band
[01:09:04.100 --> 01:09:05.620]   that, you know, add more flexibility,
[01:09:05.620 --> 01:09:07.060]   but the rules are still pretty simple.
[01:09:07.060 --> 01:09:08.620]   You follow who you want.
[01:09:08.620 --> 01:09:09.820]   They follow you if they want.
[01:09:09.820 --> 01:09:11.500]   There's 140 characters.
[01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:15.900]   And you get to decide how much you wanna be involved
[01:09:15.900 --> 01:09:17.260]   in any aspect of it.
[01:09:17.260 --> 01:09:19.380]   Like, why is Twitter different from email?
[01:09:19.380 --> 01:09:21.460]   'Cause you don't really have to read Twitter
[01:09:21.460 --> 01:09:23.620]   in the same way that you have to read your email.
[01:09:23.620 --> 01:09:26.380]   And like you say, I mean, for us, it's like, you know,
[01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:28.220]   if we have the slightest inkling,
[01:09:28.220 --> 01:09:29.700]   whether there might be an earthquake,
[01:09:29.700 --> 01:09:31.940]   well, that'll be on SF Gate in two hours, you know,
[01:09:31.940 --> 01:09:33.860]   at some celebrity bikini story.
[01:09:33.860 --> 01:09:35.260]   But like, if I wanna find out there's an earthquake,
[01:09:35.260 --> 01:09:37.060]   I'll go straight to Twitter.
[01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:38.460]   I guess all I'm saying is like, you know,
[01:09:38.460 --> 01:09:40.700]   and over time, I think they've actually done a pretty,
[01:09:40.700 --> 01:09:42.540]   pretty good job of not screwing that up
[01:09:42.540 --> 01:09:44.220]   in a thousand ways they could have screwed it up.
[01:09:44.220 --> 01:09:45.900]   That sounds like I'm damning them with faint praise.
[01:09:45.900 --> 01:09:47.100]   I'm really happy.
[01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:48.860]   I mean, the reason I'm still there,
[01:09:48.860 --> 01:09:50.500]   the reason my friends are still there,
[01:09:50.500 --> 01:09:52.940]   is it has not been corrupted in a super weird way.
[01:09:52.940 --> 01:09:54.100]   - Yeah.
[01:09:54.100 --> 01:09:55.420]   - But you know, like you say,
[01:09:55.420 --> 01:09:57.540]   when you get these kind of weird mystery meat things with,
[01:09:57.540 --> 01:09:58.980]   like, you know, did I really follow that person?
[01:09:58.980 --> 01:09:59.900]   Like, why is this here?
[01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:01.500]   What does this mean?
[01:10:01.500 --> 01:10:03.180]   I don't know what the answer is.
[01:10:03.180 --> 01:10:05.060]   I have to say, as I sit here,
[01:10:05.060 --> 01:10:07.740]   I don't understand why Google hasn't bought them
[01:10:07.740 --> 01:10:08.580]   three times over.
[01:10:08.580 --> 01:10:10.500]   It just seems like the most obvious fit in the world.
[01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:13.660]   So many of the folks at Twitter are Google, Alumna.
[01:10:13.660 --> 01:10:15.900]   And I guess I'm just kind of blown away
[01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:17.140]   that hasn't happened yet.
[01:10:17.140 --> 01:10:18.220]   I'm surprised they've made it this long time.
[01:10:18.220 --> 01:10:20.620]   - Why would Google want them?
[01:10:20.620 --> 01:10:22.500]   - It's the member of the thing about the glue
[01:10:22.500 --> 01:10:24.260]   and the conversation and holding it together.
[01:10:24.260 --> 01:10:25.180]   - Yeah, but what is Google's business?
[01:10:25.180 --> 01:10:28.300]   Google's business is organizing all the world's data.
[01:10:28.300 --> 01:10:30.100]   That's one of the things they say.
[01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:33.500]   They did try to do a social network
[01:10:33.500 --> 01:10:35.140]   to get more social signals with Google.
[01:10:35.140 --> 01:10:36.620]   Plus that was a flop.
[01:10:36.620 --> 01:10:38.140]   - And Google Buzz and--
[01:10:38.140 --> 01:10:38.980]   - And look at--
[01:10:38.980 --> 01:10:40.780]   - And Google Wave and many other things.
[01:10:40.780 --> 01:10:41.620]   - Yeah.
[01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:43.860]   Twitter would add--
[01:10:43.860 --> 01:10:45.980]   I mean, they've just started to include Twitter results
[01:10:45.980 --> 01:10:47.140]   in the Google search, right?
[01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:49.620]   - I mean, Twitter is by definition real time.
[01:10:49.620 --> 01:10:51.580]   And I think Google is interested in real time
[01:10:51.580 --> 01:10:55.100]   and thinks of itself as not having aced real time.
[01:10:55.100 --> 01:10:55.940]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:10:55.940 --> 01:10:57.260]   - And that might be appealing to them.
[01:10:57.260 --> 01:10:59.980]   - Okay, well, we've decided Google, buy them.
[01:10:59.980 --> 01:11:00.820]   - Done.
[01:11:00.820 --> 01:11:01.660]   - Done.
[01:11:01.660 --> 01:11:02.500]   That was easy.
[01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:04.500]   - Next issue.
[01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:09.380]   - Do you still post funny stuff on Twitter?
[01:11:09.380 --> 01:11:11.300]   - I mean, I'm not saying that.
[01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:12.140]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:11:12.140 --> 01:11:12.980]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:11:12.980 --> 01:11:13.820]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:11:13.820 --> 01:11:14.820]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:11:14.820 --> 01:11:15.660]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:11:15.660 --> 01:11:16.500]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:17.500]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:11:17.500 --> 01:11:18.340]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:11:18.340 --> 01:11:19.340]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:11:19.340 --> 01:11:20.340]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:11:20.340 --> 01:11:21.180]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:11:21.180 --> 01:11:22.020]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:22.860]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:11:22.860 --> 01:11:23.700]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:11:23.700 --> 01:11:24.540]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:11:24.540 --> 01:11:25.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:11:25.380 --> 01:11:26.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:11:26.380 --> 01:11:27.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:11:27.380 --> 01:11:28.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:11:28.380 --> 01:11:29.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:11:29.380 --> 01:11:30.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:11:30.380 --> 01:11:31.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:11:31.380 --> 01:11:32.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:11:32.380 --> 01:11:45.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:11:45.380 --> 01:11:46.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:11:46.380 --> 01:11:47.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:11:47.380 --> 01:11:48.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:11:48.380 --> 01:11:49.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:50.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:11:50.380 --> 01:11:51.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:11:51.380 --> 01:11:52.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:11:52.380 --> 01:11:53.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:11:53.380 --> 01:11:54.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:11:54.380 --> 01:11:55.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:11:55.380 --> 01:11:56.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:11:56.380 --> 01:11:57.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:11:57.380 --> 01:11:58.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:11:58.380 --> 01:11:59.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:11:59.380 --> 01:12:00.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:12:00.380 --> 01:12:01.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:02.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:12:02.380 --> 01:12:03.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:04.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:12:04.380 --> 01:12:05.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:12:05.380 --> 01:12:06.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:12:06.380 --> 01:12:07.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:08.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:12:08.380 --> 01:12:09.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:12:09.380 --> 01:12:10.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:12:10.380 --> 01:12:11.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:12:11.380 --> 01:12:12.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:12:12.380 --> 01:12:13.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:12:13.380 --> 01:12:14.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:12:14.380 --> 01:12:15.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:12:15.380 --> 01:12:16.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:12:16.380 --> 01:12:17.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:12:17.380 --> 01:12:18.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:12:18.380 --> 01:12:19.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:12:19.380 --> 01:12:20.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:12:20.380 --> 01:12:21.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:12:21.380 --> 01:12:22.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:12:22.380 --> 01:12:23.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:12:23.380 --> 01:12:24.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:12:24.380 --> 01:12:25.380]   - I'm not saying that.
[01:12:25.380 --> 01:12:32.380]   - I can't believe that guy was a programmer.
[01:12:32.380 --> 01:12:35.380]   That doesn't make any sense.
[01:12:35.380 --> 01:12:36.380]   - It's so strange.
[01:12:36.380 --> 01:12:37.380]   - God, what an odd person.
[01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:39.380]   But anyway, you know, but that's the beauty part.
[01:12:39.380 --> 01:12:40.380]   So I don't know.
[01:12:40.380 --> 01:12:41.380]   I hope it sticks around.
[01:12:41.380 --> 01:12:42.380]   I hope it stays good.
[01:12:42.380 --> 01:12:47.380]   I hope that people can continue making apps for it because I know nobody cares about this
[01:12:47.380 --> 01:12:49.380]   tiny percentage of nerds that have been using it for a long time.
[01:12:49.380 --> 01:12:54.380]   But me and all of my friends are really, we talk a lot about things like being able to
[01:12:54.380 --> 01:12:56.380]   make apps a lot better and I do use it a lot.
[01:12:56.380 --> 01:12:59.380]   - I find myself using the website more than I would have expected.
[01:12:59.380 --> 01:13:02.380]   Not on mobile, obviously.
[01:13:02.380 --> 01:13:03.380]   - It works well.
[01:13:03.380 --> 01:13:05.380]   The quoting thing works.
[01:13:05.380 --> 01:13:06.380]   So I don't know.
[01:13:06.380 --> 01:13:08.380]   It's been so fun for so long.
[01:13:08.380 --> 01:13:12.380]   It's one of those things where it's almost like a BBS where I feel like I've met or a user
[01:13:12.380 --> 01:13:16.380]   group, something that I met certain people through these kinds of things.
[01:13:16.380 --> 01:13:19.380]   And in a way that felt very pure in a lot of ways.
[01:13:19.380 --> 01:13:23.380]   Like, yeah, I'm sure you're seeing this certain performance version of a person.
[01:13:23.380 --> 01:13:25.380]   But that's how I got to know the guys and you look nice today.
[01:13:25.380 --> 01:13:28.380]   Like, that's how I've met so many people that have become my really good friends.
[01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:32.380]   - And by the way, to answer my own question, you still post very funny stuff onto Twitter.
[01:13:32.380 --> 01:13:34.380]   I'm just reading through your feed.
[01:13:34.380 --> 01:13:38.380]   - I can nominate many much funnier people to follow.
[01:13:38.380 --> 01:13:44.380]   But I stand by the fact that we're all just holding our breath for the day when something
[01:13:44.380 --> 01:13:47.380]   comes along that makes it just not fun to use anymore and I haven't gotten that yet.
[01:13:47.380 --> 01:13:48.380]   - No, I haven't either actually.
[01:13:48.380 --> 01:13:50.380]   - And also I've been fortunate.
[01:13:50.380 --> 01:13:53.380]   Like, I'm glad to see them beefing up stuff.
[01:13:53.380 --> 01:13:55.380]   You mentioned maybe in the show notes we talk about the block list stuff.
[01:13:55.380 --> 01:13:59.380]   It's a shame that we have to do that with such a blind instrument.
[01:13:59.380 --> 01:14:01.380]   But for some folks out there, that's really important.
[01:14:01.380 --> 01:14:04.380]   - Yeah, we've had our share of trolling.
[01:14:04.380 --> 01:14:06.380]   You know, I haven't left.
[01:14:06.380 --> 01:14:07.380]   It's still worth it.
[01:14:07.380 --> 01:14:10.380]   But what I would like to do is just follow the people you follow.
[01:14:10.380 --> 01:14:12.380]   - So I can give you-- - Oh, so it's like the opposite.
[01:14:12.380 --> 01:14:13.380]   That's good.
[01:14:13.380 --> 01:14:14.380]   - So I get your experience-- - That's pretty interesting.
[01:14:14.380 --> 01:14:16.380]   - I want your experience of Twitter.
[01:14:16.380 --> 01:14:17.380]   Because that's really it.
[01:14:17.380 --> 01:14:18.380]   - I'll come up with a list.
[01:14:18.380 --> 01:14:20.380]   I will have five good names to follow by.
[01:14:20.380 --> 01:14:24.380]   - Are you in outside lands right now?
[01:14:24.380 --> 01:14:26.380]   - Oh, yeah, right there.
[01:14:26.380 --> 01:14:27.380]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:14:27.380 --> 01:14:29.380]   - We're going to take a break.
[01:14:29.380 --> 01:14:34.380]   When we come back, I do actually speaking of that, I wouldn't mind talking about the horror
[01:14:34.380 --> 01:14:37.380]   that Reddit has gone through in the last few days.
[01:14:37.380 --> 01:14:43.380]   And I'm wondering if maybe it's the end for Reddit thanks to the lovely folks of the Internet.
[01:14:43.380 --> 01:14:44.380]   And there's lots more.
[01:14:44.380 --> 01:14:46.380]   Lots more to talk about.
[01:14:46.380 --> 01:14:53.380]   We got a jam-packed show and a great team to do it here from Dylan Twenties here from Venturebeat.
[01:14:53.380 --> 01:15:01.380]   Great to have him, editor at Lodge from Tech Thing, my buddy, Mo Powell, Mr. Patrick Norton.
[01:15:01.380 --> 01:15:27.380]   And of course, the technologizer Harry McCracken and Merlin Mann.
[01:15:27.380 --> 01:15:32.380]   - You know, every relationship is different.
[01:15:32.380 --> 01:15:35.380]   You get a different comfort level.
[01:15:35.380 --> 01:15:36.380]   You get a man diaper?
[01:15:36.380 --> 01:15:37.380]   - Now would be a good time.
[01:15:37.380 --> 01:15:39.380]   Get your astronaut diapers out.
[01:15:39.380 --> 01:15:41.380]   It's time for a break.
[01:15:41.380 --> 01:15:45.380]   You too, in the studio audience, I won't take offense.
[01:15:45.380 --> 01:15:48.380]   I'll show you the way Linda.com.
[01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:50.380]   We love Linda.com.
[01:15:50.380 --> 01:15:56.380]   It's for problem solvers, for people who be curious, not just curious people, but the curious people.
[01:15:56.380 --> 01:16:01.380]   Look, I think the human brain, the human animal is really designed to learn.
[01:16:01.380 --> 01:16:03.380]   And what better place than Linda.com?
[01:16:03.380 --> 01:16:07.380]   3,000 incredible on-demand video courses.
[01:16:07.380 --> 01:16:13.380]   Yesterday we had Bert Monroy on the show, and he did the thing that he does every week on Linda.com.
[01:16:13.380 --> 01:16:17.380]   He explains amazing Photoshop tips and tricks.
[01:16:17.380 --> 01:16:21.380]   And unlike watching it on the new screen savers, you can pause.
[01:16:21.380 --> 01:16:23.380]   Bert, you can read the transcripts.
[01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:24.380]   You can search it.
[01:16:24.380 --> 01:16:27.380]   You can get work stuff, you know, a little work.
[01:16:27.380 --> 01:16:30.380]   He's doing, oh look, I love what he does.
[01:16:30.380 --> 01:16:36.380]   If you're interested in photography, Linda.com just added another new weekly series, the DIY photographer.
[01:16:36.380 --> 01:16:39.380]   That's Joseph Laneschke. He's really good.
[01:16:39.380 --> 01:16:43.380]   He talks about how to make your own macro lens for a few bucks.
[01:16:43.380 --> 01:16:51.380]   There are courses on exploring photography, exposure and dynamic range, Lightroom 6, Lightroom CC Essential Training,
[01:16:51.380 --> 01:16:55.380]   and Up and Running with Google Photos, and the best Photoshop training in the world.
[01:16:55.380 --> 01:17:02.380]   Because Linda gets the people who really do this for a living, and the best teachers, they give you transcriptions.
[01:17:02.380 --> 01:17:06.380]   And you know what's great? You subscribe to this, and you got the run of the site.
[01:17:06.380 --> 01:17:10.380]   Everything on the site for a low monthly fee.
[01:17:10.380 --> 01:17:14.380]   It's really a great deal. Watch and learn from the best.
[01:17:14.380 --> 01:17:19.380]   Stream thousands of courses on-demand. Learn on your own schedule at your own pace.
[01:17:19.380 --> 01:17:24.380]   Classes are structured so you can watch them any way you want from start to finish or a bit at a time.
[01:17:24.380 --> 01:17:27.380]   Take notes as you go to refer to them later on the site.
[01:17:27.380 --> 01:17:32.380]   Download tutorials and watch them on the go on your iOS or Android device. Take them on the plane with you.
[01:17:32.380 --> 01:17:37.380]   Create playlists. This is great. Whether it's for work or for fun, you've got to have a Linda subscription.
[01:17:37.380 --> 01:17:41.380]   Actually, a lot of businesses do. We certainly do for our employees.
[01:17:41.380 --> 01:17:46.380]   I want you to visit Lindalynda.com/twit2. 10 days free.
[01:17:46.380 --> 01:17:51.380]   Plenty of time to really take a look at all of this. 10 days free.
[01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:58.380]   Lindalynda.com/twit2. We're big fans. I know you will be too.
[01:17:58.380 --> 01:18:02.380]   Linda.com.
[01:18:02.380 --> 01:18:07.380]   So, as everybody trickles back, that's probably not the right word to use.
[01:18:07.380 --> 01:18:09.380]   Language.
[01:18:09.380 --> 01:18:17.380]   I feel really bad for Ellen Powell in so many ways.
[01:18:17.380 --> 01:18:26.380]   Now she's running to a buzz. Reddit, which has been on the one hand famous for free speech.
[01:18:26.380 --> 01:18:30.380]   Yet, there are Reddit sub-readettes there that are just horrific.
[01:18:30.380 --> 01:18:35.380]   They decided to kill three of the worst some fat shaming sites.
[01:18:35.380 --> 01:18:41.380]   And then the trolls basically clobbered Reddit for doing it.
[01:18:41.380 --> 01:18:47.380]   Putting trolling content all over it.
[01:18:47.380 --> 01:18:51.380]   I suppose they'll get tired and move on.
[01:18:51.380 --> 01:18:57.380]   I don't know why they're so upset. If you have a sub-read about making fun of people who are fat,
[01:18:57.380 --> 01:19:00.380]   speaking as a fat person, that's hurtful.
[01:19:00.380 --> 01:19:01.380]   Yes.
[01:19:01.380 --> 01:19:05.380]   Shameful. Should it be censored? Did Reddit go too far?
[01:19:05.380 --> 01:19:08.380]   I'm sorry, Patrick. I shouldn't.
[01:19:08.380 --> 01:19:12.380]   Come on, Patrick. How do you feel about gamergate while we're at it?
[01:19:12.380 --> 01:19:18.380]   No, no, no. My problem is my belief in the Bill of Rights and the First Amendment
[01:19:18.380 --> 01:19:22.380]   on the role of space to face into my issue with people being delete expletives.
[01:19:22.380 --> 01:19:24.380]   This is a family podcast still. Can't you use this?
[01:19:24.380 --> 01:19:26.380]   Reddit's a business. It's not the government censorship.
[01:19:26.380 --> 01:19:30.380]   The Bill of Rights does not protect you against our chat room.
[01:19:30.380 --> 01:19:32.380]   If I want to kick somebody out from it, they say, "I can do it."
[01:19:32.380 --> 01:19:34.380]   No, no, no. It's not against the Bill of Rights.
[01:19:34.380 --> 01:19:37.380]   Free Speech says you can be as scumbag as loud as you want.
[01:19:37.380 --> 01:19:39.380]   The government can't do anything about it.
[01:19:39.380 --> 01:19:43.380]   Yeah, but I don't have to listen to you and you don't have to be on my forums.
[01:19:43.380 --> 01:19:51.380]   But it's funny because I've always thought of Reddit as having one of the nicer online audiences.
[01:19:51.380 --> 01:19:53.380]   I love Reddit.
[01:19:53.380 --> 01:19:55.380]   Is it becoming 4chan?
[01:19:55.380 --> 01:19:57.380]   I don't think it's becoming 4chan.
[01:19:57.380 --> 01:20:02.380]   Like a small group of people can do a lot of damage if they have no time and a lot of anger.
[01:20:02.380 --> 01:20:03.380]   Yeah.
[01:20:03.380 --> 01:20:10.380]   So you know, these guys who ran this fat shaming site, they all ran over to some other site that they think is better than Reddit
[01:20:10.380 --> 01:20:14.380]   because it promised not to censor anybody for anything at any time.
[01:20:14.380 --> 01:20:18.380]   And they immediately crashed at servers because it wasn't ready for the demand.
[01:20:18.380 --> 01:20:19.380]   They were too fat.
[01:20:19.380 --> 01:20:24.380]   And so then they started like, "Okay, we got to raise some money for this site, whatever it's called."
[01:20:24.380 --> 01:20:27.380]   And they're starting to like, "Come on, send us some Bitcoin."
[01:20:27.380 --> 01:20:30.380]   And they're all running around going like, "Wait, how does Bitcoin work again?
[01:20:30.380 --> 01:20:31.380]   How do I get a wallet?"
[01:20:31.380 --> 01:20:33.380]   That would be the ideal solution though.
[01:20:33.380 --> 01:20:35.380]   You know, if Reddit doesn't want them around, go somewhere else.
[01:20:35.380 --> 01:20:37.380]   You know, that's a big fat place.
[01:20:37.380 --> 01:20:38.380]   And you can go anywhere.
[01:20:38.380 --> 01:20:39.380]   It's just crazy.
[01:20:39.380 --> 01:20:47.380]   What turns out is like, it's actually maybe not so easy to run a site like Reddit and not have the servers crash with all the volume
[01:20:47.380 --> 01:20:52.380]   and how like, you know, the upvoting works smoothly and have it be there when you want it.
[01:20:52.380 --> 01:20:55.380]   So like, actually it turns out there is sort of a trade there.
[01:20:55.380 --> 01:20:56.380]   There's an exchange.
[01:20:56.380 --> 01:21:03.380]   Like, you come to our site and you know, we're going to set up some very minimal but pretty permissive rules.
[01:21:03.380 --> 01:21:08.380]   And in exchange, you get to use a site and it won't crash and there's not too much advertising and it'll be awesome.
[01:21:08.380 --> 01:21:11.380]   And these people are like, "No, I want to be able to say whatever I want."
[01:21:11.380 --> 01:21:14.380]   And you know, you don't like that.
[01:21:14.380 --> 01:21:16.380]   We're going to, you know, say screw you and leave.
[01:21:16.380 --> 01:21:17.380]   Like, "Okay, fine.
[01:21:17.380 --> 01:21:18.380]   You can leave."
[01:21:18.380 --> 01:21:25.380]   One thing that makes this challenging in any growing community is, you know, if you ask anybody about what they believe in,
[01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:27.380]   everybody's going to say something that sounds really good.
[01:21:27.380 --> 01:21:29.380]   You're going to say, "Yeah, I believe in free speech."
[01:21:29.380 --> 01:21:30.380]   Because we do.
[01:21:30.380 --> 01:21:33.380]   I think part of the question becomes, I mean, I'll speak for myself.
[01:21:33.380 --> 01:21:38.380]   There was a time, for example, where I decided on a pretty popular site of mine back in the day that I just wasn't going to,
[01:21:38.380 --> 01:21:40.380]   I couldn't do the comment thing anymore.
[01:21:40.380 --> 01:21:42.380]   People were actually buying large.
[01:21:42.380 --> 01:21:43.380]   Fantastic.
[01:21:43.380 --> 01:21:44.380]   And really great.
[01:21:44.380 --> 01:21:45.380]   And some of the best commenters in the world came to 43 folders.
[01:21:45.380 --> 01:21:47.380]   Like, it was a great community.
[01:21:47.380 --> 01:21:48.380]   We had a forum.
[01:21:48.380 --> 01:21:55.380]   But I kind of got to a point where I think a lot of people get to, which is you get kind of damned by your own success in some ways,
[01:21:55.380 --> 01:22:00.380]   where once a place gets big enough, there's going to be a whole bunch of different people there.
[01:22:00.380 --> 01:22:01.380]   You've got a whole different scale issues.
[01:22:01.380 --> 01:22:02.380]   I mean, go talk to Matt Howie.
[01:22:02.380 --> 01:22:05.380]   Talk to anybody who's tried to run a rusty or anybody who's tried to run a big site.
[01:22:05.380 --> 01:22:11.380]   And you have fundamentally different problems when you add a zero or a couple zeros to the number of people that are out there.
[01:22:11.380 --> 01:22:14.380]   Here's, I think, one part of this.
[01:22:14.380 --> 01:22:16.380]   This does not solve the problem, but I think it helps to identify the problem.
[01:22:16.380 --> 01:22:26.380]   If you've got a site that you and three of your friends write for, let's say you share a tumbler, there's this sense of what I'm going to call the living room effect, where you go, oh, this is our place.
[01:22:26.380 --> 01:22:27.380]   Like, this is our living room.
[01:22:27.380 --> 01:22:29.380]   And we don't drop a deuce on the couch.
[01:22:29.380 --> 01:22:32.380]   Like, we treat this as a place that we're going to have respect for.
[01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:33.380]   You're welcome.
[01:22:33.380 --> 01:22:37.380]   Best take on the tragedy of the commons ever.
[01:22:37.380 --> 01:22:42.380]   We don't even have to put a sign saying, please don't pinch a loaf on the couch.
[01:22:42.380 --> 01:22:44.380]   We don't even need a sign for that.
[01:22:44.380 --> 01:22:45.380]   We just know.
[01:22:45.380 --> 01:22:52.380]   The problem is, like, when you get to a place that has 10,000 or 20,000 or however many thousand people, everybody still feels like it's their living room.
[01:22:52.380 --> 01:22:56.380]   So on the one hand, there's one group of people who say, "Hey, can we try to, like, use a coaster here and take care of this?"
[01:22:56.380 --> 01:22:59.380]   And other people go, "You can't tell me what to do in my own house."
[01:22:59.380 --> 01:23:08.380]   Because if you listen to what's behind what a lot of those folks are saying, whether I personally agree with them or not, it's the same sentiment we've heard from a lot of people, which was, we heard of this with Dig however many years ago.
[01:23:08.380 --> 01:23:17.380]   Hey, we're the ones who made this site, and so being provocative about telling us what we can do here is beyond the pale in their point of view.
[01:23:17.380 --> 01:23:18.380]   Because now it's our living room.
[01:23:18.380 --> 01:23:19.380]   It's your living room.
[01:23:19.380 --> 01:23:21.380]   You can't just call this your place by fiat.
[01:23:21.380 --> 01:23:22.380]   We're the ones who built it.
[01:23:22.380 --> 01:23:25.380]   You would not even have anybody to throw off of here if it weren't for us.
[01:23:25.380 --> 01:23:29.380]   So, like I said, I don't think that solves the problem, but I think it helps frame the question.
[01:23:29.380 --> 01:23:35.380]   Whenever we try to understand how somebody feels about these things, it helps to remember that everybody thinks someplace is their living room.
[01:23:35.380 --> 01:23:41.380]   And Reddit, more than most places, was defined by having virtually no censorship, although little by little over the years.
[01:23:41.380 --> 01:23:43.380]   They've ratcheted it up a little bit.
[01:23:43.380 --> 01:23:49.380]   A few years ago, they allowed stuff on Reddit that was way worse than fat shaming, and then they got rid of that, and now they're doing this.
[01:23:49.380 --> 01:23:55.380]   Well, you know, Harry actually, I think there's censorship is rampant on Twitter.
[01:23:55.380 --> 01:23:57.380]   It's just the moderators of the subreddit.
[01:23:57.380 --> 01:23:58.380]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:23:58.380 --> 01:23:59.380]   Yeah.
[01:23:59.380 --> 01:24:04.380]   And the fact that Reddit is almost like a confederation more than one place.
[01:24:04.380 --> 01:24:16.380]   The subreddits are run by different people with different rules, and the stuff they run, they feel is there rather than part of this large company controlled by Conde Nast.
[01:24:16.380 --> 01:24:20.380]   It's kind of a challenge though for them because it is Conde Nast.
[01:24:20.380 --> 01:24:26.380]   I mean, they've distanced it enough so that they can say, well, it's not exactly us.
[01:24:26.380 --> 01:24:30.380]   And what do you do if you're Reddit?
[01:24:30.380 --> 01:24:35.380]   I mean, you don't, maybe you just, maybe it was a mistake to censor.
[01:24:35.380 --> 01:24:38.380]   Maybe you just, maybe you block illegal stuff.
[01:24:38.380 --> 01:24:40.380]   Because then it's not you making the rules.
[01:24:40.380 --> 01:24:42.380]   You just say, hey, it's illegal. We can't do that.
[01:24:42.380 --> 01:24:48.380]   Well, I mean, if you're harassing individuals that is an issue, harassing groups of people is a little bit different.
[01:24:48.380 --> 01:24:49.380]   Right.
[01:24:49.380 --> 01:24:54.380]   Stuff that's illegal or borderline illegal is different from stuff, which is merely offensive.
[01:24:54.380 --> 01:24:56.380]   Yeah.
[01:24:56.380 --> 01:25:11.380]   So I am curious, like three or four years from now, where will the bar be able to go higher and higher to a point where anything that is created by jackasses or which reasonable people might think as unpleasant is not no longer allowed.
[01:25:11.380 --> 01:25:14.380]   I do feel like when all of a sudden, it's the Internet.
[01:25:14.380 --> 01:25:19.380]   So if you're on Reddit and you're unhappy with Reddit, fine, you know, you can create your own site.
[01:25:19.380 --> 01:25:20.380]   You can find somewhere else.
[01:25:20.380 --> 01:25:22.380]   It's not censorship.
[01:25:22.380 --> 01:25:28.380]   There should never be a time when people who want to be jackasses can't create their own place to be jackasses.
[01:25:28.380 --> 01:25:29.380]   Yeah.
[01:25:29.380 --> 01:25:31.380]   But build your own damn site.
[01:25:31.380 --> 01:25:34.380]   I think we need to cheer up a little bit here.
[01:25:34.380 --> 01:25:39.380]   Let me show some videos of robots failing.
[01:25:39.380 --> 01:25:48.380]   What do you, it just makes me happy to see the robots not doing so well.
[01:25:48.380 --> 01:25:51.380]   This is how they lull us into a false sense of security.
[01:25:51.380 --> 01:25:55.380]   Somebody said that if you keep laughing at robots, you're going to regret it in a few years.
[01:25:55.380 --> 01:25:56.380]   They're like crows.
[01:25:56.380 --> 01:25:58.380]   Yeah, because that's right.
[01:25:58.380 --> 01:26:08.380]   Everybody who watched those videos on YouTube, like that, the record of you watching that video is going to be stored on Google somewhere and they will know when Skynet comes.
[01:26:08.380 --> 01:26:09.380]   I did it.
[01:26:09.380 --> 01:26:10.380]   I did it, Meyer.
[01:26:10.380 --> 01:26:20.380]   Well, show first, let's show the, this is from the DARPA challenge that we're trying to get humanoid like robots to do things like to diffuse nuclear power plates.
[01:26:20.380 --> 01:26:25.380]   It's kind of based on the tsunami and earthquake that destroyed Fukushima.
[01:26:25.380 --> 01:26:39.380]   But some of these robots just, it's hard if you're a robot to really, that's my favorite.
[01:26:39.380 --> 01:26:43.380]   And what's great is the audience is cheering the robot on.
[01:26:43.380 --> 01:26:52.380]   So you got to kind of admire them. The winning, the challenge was a course of eight challenges.
[01:26:52.380 --> 01:26:56.380]   These are autonomous robots. They're not remote controlled robots. They're autonomous.
[01:26:56.380 --> 01:27:00.380]   I think six of the eight they knew about ahead of programmers, knew about ahead of time.
[01:27:00.380 --> 01:27:02.380]   Two were just random, you didn't know.
[01:27:02.380 --> 01:27:05.380]   They had to drive a car, they had to open a door, they had to turn a valve.
[01:27:05.380 --> 01:27:11.380]   The kinds of things a robot would need to do to diffuse the nuclear power plant at Fukushima.
[01:27:11.380 --> 01:27:18.380]   But the South Korean robot one ran a two million dollar prize.
[01:27:18.380 --> 01:27:20.380]   Are you sad? Is it sad?
[01:27:20.380 --> 01:27:20.380]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,
[01:27:20.380 --> 01:27:40.380]   I think it's depressing.
[01:27:40.380 --> 01:27:54.380]   I'm not sure.
[01:27:54.380 --> 01:28:09.380]   I'm not sure.
[01:28:09.380 --> 01:28:26.380]   I'm not sure.
