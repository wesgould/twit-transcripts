[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.760]   I hope that hiatus has been operated on and has now completely removed.
[00:00:58.760 --> 00:01:00.120]   We've missed you, Patrick.
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.440]   Oh, well, it's that darn business production schedule.
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:05.480]   See us holiday travel thing.
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:06.480]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:11.560]   Yeah, between Dusty Trucks and trade shows in Vegas, it's hard to get, Patrick, but
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.560]   we're glad to have you.
[00:01:12.560 --> 00:01:14.120]   And I know you have a lot of seats.
[00:01:14.120 --> 00:01:16.920]   Trapped in Wyoming behind the snowstorm was part of it.
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:17.920]   Oh, dear.
[00:01:17.920 --> 00:01:18.920]   Oh, wow.
[00:01:18.920 --> 00:01:19.920]   That was unplanned?
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:22.280]   No, I love Vlerving Wyoming.
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:25.000]   It's one of my favorite towns in Wyoming after Jackson Hole.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   I was not planning on spending, you know, a day and a half there waiting for a route
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.600]   80 to open up on my way home.
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.120]   Wow, wow.
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.840]   Also from Great Britain on the line, Will Harris from bit-tech.net.
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.080]   He's become one of our most welcome regulars.
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.200]   And he's the guy who stirred up the whole thing with the pink jumper and the pink glasses
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:49.520]   and Adam Curry.
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:54.960]   It was your idea to offer him $20 and lo and behold, look here, he is, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:01:54.960 --> 00:02:00.720]   The pod father himself, the founder of Podshow, of course, the original podcaster with his
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:03.480]   daily source code still going strong over 500 episodes.
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:05.680]   Adam, I'm so glad we could have you on the tour.
[00:02:05.680 --> 00:02:09.080]   Oh, it's really great to be here, Leo, and you may now kiss the ring.
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:10.080]   Go ahead.
[00:02:10.080 --> 00:02:11.840]   Can I tongue it?
[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:12.840]   Is it okay to tongue it?
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:15.640]   Yeah, as long as you get around all the edges.
[00:02:15.640 --> 00:02:17.640]   How polished it.
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:18.640]   Will you?
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:19.640]   We're just going to the pub.
[00:02:19.640 --> 00:02:22.560]   Y'all can call us when you're done with us.
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:24.160]   Slightly unsettling the splash.
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:25.840]   I'm just glad Adam's got his connectivity.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:30.120]   He's in San Francisco today and I guess Comcast was not behaving earlier this week.
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.760]   This is so amazing.
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:35.400]   I am literally, you got to check this out.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:37.720]   I'm going to do a whole video show about this.
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:39.840]   I jacked into the telco closet.
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:45.240]   I put a Wi-Fi range extender into a hub that is picked up by my iMac which then routes
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:48.680]   to a Link-Sis which then spreads it throughout the condo.
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:53.640]   Do not mess with Curry, man, when it comes to connectivity.
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:54.640]   Damn it.
[00:02:54.640 --> 00:02:55.640]   Damn it.
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:03:00.600]   This is one of the things I think that's so cool about you Adam is you're kind of a
[00:03:00.600 --> 00:03:01.600]   movie star.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:03.600]   I mean, starting with MTV and everything.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.400]   And yet you're really quite a geek deep down.
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.600]   In fact, really, that's perhaps what your legacy will be.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.840]   Do people have they finally stopped introducing you as former MTV, BJ?
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:17.600]   Oh, I don't think that'll ever stop.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:19.160]   Is that driving the crazy?
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:20.160]   No, no, no.
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:24.640]   I'm very proud of the time I spent there, not proud of all the work that I did, but it
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.520]   was a very exciting time and an interesting point in the history of media when things
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:30.080]   were changing dramatically.
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.080]   True.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:36.280]   But it is true that if you look at the roots of my broadcasting career, it started with
[00:03:36.280 --> 00:03:40.520]   me building my own transmitter and having my mom drive me around the block to see how
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:42.160]   far the signal would reach.
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.640]   And I had the Radio Shack 101 project kit, so I was always making stuff.
[00:03:47.640 --> 00:03:51.200]   So I'm totally a geek.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:53.880]   I just met the right people who knew how to do my hair.
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.880]   Well, and your wife still does your hair, I think, so she's doing that.
[00:03:57.880 --> 00:03:58.880]   Absolutely, absolutely.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:00.640]   I'll tell her the other.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:01.640]   Thank you.
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:04.560]   Still looking a little shorter, but still looking like a movie star.
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.600]   Pink jumper or not?
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.280]   Let me just say one thing about the pink jumper.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:15.160]   You know, when you go, this was at the podcast con UK, which is not really the epitome of
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.920]   the fashion industry.
[00:04:16.920 --> 00:04:21.920]   So no matter what, no matter what you come in dressed as, you know, the, and the pink
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:22.920]   jumper.
[00:04:22.920 --> 00:04:23.920]   Okay.
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:24.920]   But I just want to make one thing very clear.
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.480]   The glasses, the rose tinted glasses are really foreseeing.
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:30.360]   They're not, you know, sunglasses.
[00:04:30.360 --> 00:04:34.640]   Yes, they're purposely rose tinted because let's face it, the word looks nicer that
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:35.640]   way.
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:38.360]   Well, in the interest of full disclosure, we didn't give you 20 bucks either.
[00:04:38.360 --> 00:04:40.080]   So that's true.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:44.320]   Although I am using a splendid flavor blend right now in my senseio coffee.
[00:04:44.320 --> 00:04:46.200]   So Leo, I appreciate it.
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:47.960]   I'll send that snippet to the client.
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.640]   And in fact, I use GoDaddy to register all my domains.
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:56.680]   Well, you know, you laugh about it, but this is exactly what brand advertising is about.
[00:04:56.680 --> 00:05:02.480]   Brand advertising is not about finding some relevance on a webpage and putting a relevant
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:05.760]   link to a product to click.
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:09.400]   You know, it's about creating a brand messaging and it carries through.
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:10.840]   Here you are talking about splenders.
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:12.640]   It was the most normal thing in the world.
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:13.640]   Well, it is.
[00:05:13.640 --> 00:05:14.640]   It is with the advantage of.
[00:05:14.640 --> 00:05:18.480]   You know, folks don't worry, this isn't going to become inside podcasting for the rest of
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:19.480]   the show.
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.480]   We will get to the tech news.
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:23.200]   But I want to talk to people who are fascinated that people actually use splendid in real
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:24.200]   life.
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:25.200]   I love it.
[00:05:25.200 --> 00:05:26.200]   I'll be honest with you.
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.200]   I use splendid.
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:31.600]   In fact, I, Kelly and Neil were up doing call for help a few months ago and they got the
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:33.080]   call that splendid was going to be on the show.
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:34.560]   And I said, Oh, hey, Neil, I'm a big splendid.
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.720]   I don't use the flavor blends.
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:37.920]   I'll be honest with you, but I do love splendid.
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:41.160]   I hate to think, you know, nobody knows what it's doing to me, but it's, but you know,
[00:05:41.160 --> 00:05:42.160]   that's sure it's fine.
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:46.920]   Now, you can go to the truth about splendid.com and you can find out what it's not doing
[00:05:46.920 --> 00:05:47.920]   to you.
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:48.920]   All right.
[00:05:48.920 --> 00:05:51.600]   But just by the record, I'm a very big fan of the pink jumper.
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:53.240]   I didn't think it was very well.
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:54.240]   All right.
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:55.240]   Thank you.
[00:05:55.240 --> 00:05:56.240]   Thank you.
[00:05:56.240 --> 00:05:57.240]   It was the, it was the context.
[00:05:57.240 --> 00:06:03.200]   Your confirming everything everybody thinks about Brits right now, Will, you understand that?
[00:06:03.200 --> 00:06:04.200]   Well, why is that?
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.560]   I don't know why that is.
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.120]   I've never met a more macho manly per, you know, people as a whole.
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:12.120]   Are you kidding me, Leo?
[00:06:12.120 --> 00:06:15.160]   It's like 70% of all British men are gay.
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:16.160]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.000]   You see, you see, you see.
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   Now you let's slow down a little bit.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.360]   Now, before you get to San Francisco while you're saying that, don't get to get to me.
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:26.720]   And he skew the results a little bit.
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:30.920]   And he has an I want you poster as his icon on Skype.
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.160]   So I don't know what that means.
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.800]   And what neighborhood do you live in?
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:35.800]   I think may as well get all the facts out.
[00:06:35.800 --> 00:06:36.800]   Now, come on.
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.760]   Not that there's anything wrong with that, but getting back to what you were saying
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:45.800]   about a podcasting and advertising, I think that that's an interesting juxtaposition.
[00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.480]   You obviously were talking about Google ads versus podcast ads.
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.760]   And I think that that is one of the strengths of podcasting ads.
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:55.080]   They're personal as opposed to in personal.
[00:06:55.080 --> 00:07:00.640]   Well, from a business perspective, and I've always made very clear, Pachio is about commercializing
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:08.640]   whatever we can in this new media revolution, you know, Google is extremely successful with
[00:07:08.640 --> 00:07:09.640]   their ad words.
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:10.640]   There's no doubt about it.
[00:07:10.640 --> 00:07:12.360]   They've turned advertising on their head.
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:18.640]   But the big end game that even Google is working towards is brand advertising and creating
[00:07:18.640 --> 00:07:19.640]   an affinity.
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:23.480]   And if you look at the relationship between the producer of a podcast who is also often
[00:07:23.480 --> 00:07:29.480]   a host and the audience, that's where they call what they call the customer engagement,
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:30.760]   what we call audience Leo.
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:33.920]   Engagement is the big word in advertising right now, isn't it?
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:34.920]   Right.
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:35.920]   But it's all about audience.
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:39.040]   And no matter what you're talking about, your audience will, you know, they'll buy stuff
[00:07:39.040 --> 00:07:41.120]   that you're not even getting paid to promote.
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:43.320]   Mostly that's the case because we have so few.
[00:07:43.320 --> 00:07:46.520]   Well, happy to talk to you about that, sir.
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:47.520]   You know that.
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:48.520]   Yeah.
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:52.360]   You know, how is, first of all, I actually would like to ask you a little bit about Pachio
[00:07:52.360 --> 00:07:55.120]   because it isn't exactly clear what the notion is.
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:59.560]   As some people said, you're trying to build a new media network.
[00:07:59.560 --> 00:08:00.560]   Is it an advertising network?
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:01.920]   Is it a network of programs?
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:03.600]   What exactly is the plan with Pachio?
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:10.960]   Well, it is a new media network because in order to have network entertainment, you know,
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:15.400]   you have to be able to do the networking side and the entertainment side.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:22.080]   And it's all built around our version of an advertising platform, the way we sell packages
[00:08:22.080 --> 00:08:27.960]   to advertisers, the way we work with producers and hosts, who we have relationships with or
[00:08:27.960 --> 00:08:29.360]   things that we create ourselves.
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:32.600]   And it does make sense to integrate that across the board, I have to say.
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:35.400]   You have to scale it, absolutely.
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:40.520]   And also, advertisers are looking for, you know, I'm sorry, advertisers, of course, are
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:45.080]   looking for their audience, but the agencies they work with, you know, they're looking
[00:08:45.080 --> 00:08:48.640]   for a place where they can go, where they're going to get consistency, they know what's
[00:08:48.640 --> 00:08:52.400]   going to be delivered, they know how it's going to be reported to them.
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:53.920]   So that's kind of where we fit in.
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:54.920]   Yeah.
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:55.920]   And it's going well.
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:59.720]   So Adam, I got to say, if your advertisers are looking for that much, they're ahead of
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.240]   the curve in a lot of places, because most of the places I've seen are trying to define
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:08.320]   how video and audio is delivered on the web and there's more traction systems I've run
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:11.560]   into in the last year than ever thought would be possible.
[00:09:11.560 --> 00:09:13.160]   Numbers are the problem, aren't they, really?
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:18.680]   Well, you know, what we work on the hardest, you can't have media change the way it's created,
[00:09:18.680 --> 00:09:21.960]   the way it's distributed, who creates and distributes it.
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:25.080]   You can't have that change without advertising changing.
[00:09:25.080 --> 00:09:29.080]   That is what we work on the hardest, is changing advertising.
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:33.360]   And that's what our agency spends a lot of time doing, educating ad agencies, trying
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.400]   to explain to them, this is something different.
[00:09:36.400 --> 00:09:39.840]   It's not radio, you know, it's something different.
[00:09:39.840 --> 00:09:44.160]   We don't have to sell it in 30 second chunks because we have no limitation on time.
[00:09:44.160 --> 00:09:46.080]   Ergo this conversation that's going on.
[00:09:46.080 --> 00:09:47.880]   And on and on and on.
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:49.720]   And in this week's technique.
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.400]   I want to talk about Pirate Bay.
[00:09:51.400 --> 00:09:54.720]   It's a little bit an old story, but I think since we've got two Brits on here, two people
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:58.480]   who live in Britain anyway, this is such a tradition in Britain to have these pirate radio
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:02.840]   stations like Radio Luxor and C-Land and Radio Caroline.
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:09.600]   Now Pirate Bay, the BitTorrent tracker site that has been up and down in Sweden, I think
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:12.800]   it's more publicity than anything else, but wants to buy Sea Land.
[00:10:12.800 --> 00:10:15.680]   Sea Land's got a kind of crazy quilt of history.
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:18.040]   Will Harris, are you following this story?
[00:10:18.040 --> 00:10:19.800]   Yeah, it's pretty crazy.
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:22.040]   I mean, bit like a Sea Land.
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.040]   Sea Land was a bit.
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:25.840]   Well, they might call it Bitland when they own it.
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:26.840]   I don't know.
[00:10:26.840 --> 00:10:28.320]   Like an oil rig.
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:30.200]   No, it's a naval platform.
[00:10:30.200 --> 00:10:31.560]   It was for target practice.
[00:10:31.560 --> 00:10:33.160]   It's a naval platform.
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:36.480]   Yeah, well, it's a pile of concrete off and off the British.
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:39.640]   It looks like a drilling rig, it does.
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:44.040]   Well, so I don't know if the guy still owns it, but for many years as a guy who lived
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:48.920]   on Sea Land and he had his own passports and his own money and it wasn't recognized internationally.
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:50.480]   Roy of Sea Land.
[00:10:50.480 --> 00:10:54.640]   Roy of Sea Land, and he's still there and the problem is he's getting old and he's trying
[00:10:54.640 --> 00:10:56.280]   to sell it off.
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:11:00.160]   But were they ever acknowledged as a real sovereign nation?
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:01.160]   No, I don't think so.
[00:11:01.160 --> 00:11:07.440]   I mean, if they could shut down all of MP3.com in Russia, eventually, I'm sure they can shut
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:08.440]   down Sea Land.
[00:11:08.440 --> 00:11:11.000]   So it sounds like more like a publicity stunt tonight, which is a nice one.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   But what I want to know is if they're going to set up Pirate Bay on Sea Land, what exactly
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.840]   is the net connectivity in the middle of the ocean on a naval platform?
[00:11:17.840 --> 00:11:18.920]   Apparently, it's one megabit.
[00:11:18.920 --> 00:11:20.200]   It's not enough to run a track.
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.120]   Dude, I've got the setup here in my condo.
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:23.360]   I can sell it to him.
[00:11:23.360 --> 00:11:24.360]   No problem.
[00:11:24.360 --> 00:11:27.480]   They can wire it for wide wide wide wide wide wide wide wide wide wide wide wide wide wide.
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:30.360]   All you need is a Pringles cantana and you're set.
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:34.200]   Well, of course, the concept with BitTorrent is that they only have they only have to
[00:11:34.200 --> 00:11:35.360]   seat it from Sea Land.
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.360]   They don't actually have to have all the bandwidth.
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:40.000]   But imagine the bandwidth on the Pirate Bay is pretty serious.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:42.200]   I mean, there's a lot of people use it.
[00:11:42.200 --> 00:11:43.200]   How is all of MP3?
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:44.200]   It's still alive.
[00:11:44.200 --> 00:11:45.200]   It's still running.
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:47.080]   You can't use a credit card, but they don't seem like they're out of business.
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:54.080]   I don't know how well they're I mean, the RIAA's attempt to shut them down isn't that effective.
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.080]   I don't know.
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:58.120]   It's, you know, that's on an agenda somewhere at the UN.
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.840]   Oh, it's on a big agenda.
[00:11:59.840 --> 00:12:00.840]   Absolutely.
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:03.160]   You think you think it's really on a big agenda?
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.320]   Well, in the United States it is.
[00:12:05.320 --> 00:12:06.320]   Yeah.
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:10.400]   I mean, it's been a part of economic policy of the United States government that's been
[00:12:10.400 --> 00:12:12.720]   beating on Russia.
[00:12:12.720 --> 00:12:15.920]   It's actually written into these treaties now.
[00:12:15.920 --> 00:12:17.080]   They're named by name.
[00:12:17.080 --> 00:12:21.200]   Well, it's pretty much like the Gucci bags and the sunglasses that you can buy on any
[00:12:21.200 --> 00:12:23.760]   street in New York or LA or San Francisco.
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.920]   You know, yeah, they're supposed to be stopping that too.
[00:12:25.920 --> 00:12:26.920]   Yeah, right.
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:31.120]   But it's just, you know, I don't buy that shit.
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:34.480]   Because when they, because someone will rip your shit off and you'll be really angry.
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:36.720]   Adam, I'm going to have to edit those.
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:37.720]   We have a, we can't say that.
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:38.720]   I'm sorry.
[00:12:38.720 --> 00:12:39.720]   I'm a clean tag.
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.200]   This is not the daily source code, my friend.
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:46.120]   I can't go around with the $13 million airplane strapped to my tuckus.
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.120]   It's 15.
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:48.120]   15, I'm sorry.
[00:12:48.120 --> 00:12:54.080]   Actually, that's an interesting story is Virgin Atlantic's attempt to get into the US market
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.080]   with a viral video.
[00:12:55.080 --> 00:12:56.400]   Have you seen the viral video?
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:12:57.680]   No, I haven't.
[00:12:57.680 --> 00:13:03.400]   The problem is that US law prohibits non US citizens from operating an airline in the United
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:04.400]   States.
[00:13:04.400 --> 00:13:10.080]   Virgin would like to get into the US and the Department of Transportation is blocking them
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.080]   right now.
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:13.040]   I think Arnab will fix that.
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:17.040]   On the first coming in and say, if I can become president, Richard, you can become an
[00:13:17.040 --> 00:13:18.040]   American citizen.
[00:13:18.040 --> 00:13:21.320]   Now they're doing it through a shell company.
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:24.840]   It's a shell and it's all Americans running it, but the Department of Transportation seems
[00:13:24.840 --> 00:13:26.640]   not to be swayed.
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.040]   So now they've gone to YouTube and you can actually see this.
[00:13:29.040 --> 00:13:34.560]   Our friend Alex Lindsey produced a commercial for these new jets, which looks slick.
[00:13:34.560 --> 00:13:40.040]   Linux box is running with entertainment and they're trying to get people to sign petitions,
[00:13:40.040 --> 00:13:47.160]   which I signed to get the DOT to get off their BUTT and let Virgin in.
[00:13:47.160 --> 00:13:53.520]   I fly Virgin once a month and their in-flight entertainment system, which indeed the one
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:56.720]   they're using currently is based on Linux because I've seen the boot screen a couple
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.040]   of times.
[00:13:58.040 --> 00:14:01.120]   It's phenomenal.
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:06.720]   And it's really not just that it works, but they also refresh the content every month.
[00:14:06.720 --> 00:14:11.720]   They're trying to bring this to the US.
[00:14:11.720 --> 00:14:16.720]   They've got RJ11 jacks at every seat.
[00:14:16.720 --> 00:14:19.720]   They've got standard power supplies at every seat.
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:20.720]   Wait, wait.
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:21.720]   They've got POTS jacks at every seat.
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:22.720]   No, no.
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:23.720]   I'm sorry.
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:24.720]   I'm sorry.
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:25.720]   I'm standing in the presence.
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:26.720]   I bow down.
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:27.720]   I'm sorry.
[00:14:27.720 --> 00:14:28.720]   I'll kiss your ring to Patrick.
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:29.720]   RJ-40.
[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:30.720]   No, no.
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:31.720]   I was just sitting there.
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:32.720]   I was like, you bring your own phone.
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:35.720]   They've got dial up networking in every seat.
[00:14:35.720 --> 00:14:36.720]   But not currently.
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:40.480]   They have, you can use an SMS service.
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:44.800]   I wish they would do it because that's the only thing missing from that experience.
[00:14:44.800 --> 00:14:46.080]   I love them to death.
[00:14:46.080 --> 00:14:50.720]   I have a million miles, only one million more, and I can get a free flight on Spaceship 1.
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:51.720]   Really?
[00:14:51.720 --> 00:14:52.720]   Yeah, two million miles.
[00:14:52.720 --> 00:14:54.920]   How long did it take to get the first million?
[00:14:54.920 --> 00:14:55.920]   A year.
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:14:56.920]   Really?
[00:14:56.920 --> 00:14:57.920]   Yeah.
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:15:00.320]   So if I could get a million miles in one year?
[00:15:00.320 --> 00:15:04.000]   Yeah, but there's a lot of bonuses and promotions in there.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   So I probably do that.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:07.320]   Probably about a quarter million miles, 300,000 miles.
[00:15:07.320 --> 00:15:08.880]   Yeah, I'd say it's about that.
[00:15:08.880 --> 00:15:09.880]   Yeah.
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:10.880]   Good Lord.
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:11.880]   It's time to stay home.
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:14.760]   Holy cow, that's crazy.
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:17.320]   So a million miles and you would get to go to space.
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:18.320]   Would you do that?
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:19.320]   Absolutely.
[00:15:19.320 --> 00:15:20.320]   You would.
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:21.320]   Oh yeah.
[00:15:21.320 --> 00:15:22.320]   Oh man, I'd love to.
[00:15:22.320 --> 00:15:25.720]   You're talking to the guy who refused to go in the Blue Angels plane.
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:27.520]   Patrick went, but I wouldn't do it.
[00:15:27.520 --> 00:15:28.920]   Well, I'm a pilot, you know.
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:31.320]   So I kind of have that bug.
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:32.680]   You trust Richard Francis.
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:36.800]   One of the features they do have on these new jets is you could chat with the other people
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:37.800]   on the plane.
[00:15:37.800 --> 00:15:41.360]   In fact, they create a chat room of everybody on the plane, which you can go into.
[00:15:41.360 --> 00:15:42.360]   Cool.
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:43.360]   Is that bizarre?
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.400]   I don't know exactly what that would be like.
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:47.920]   So the hotty in 24G.
[00:15:47.920 --> 00:15:49.400]   You're over here, baby.
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:53.480]   They also, you can order food from the screen and they said the stewardesses will bring it
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:54.480]   to you.
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:58.720]   Can you imagine just like an IRC back channel at a conference where the stewardesses or
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:05.440]   the flight attendant is doing the safety demonstration, everyone's ranking, ranking on them in the chat.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.640]   It's the bad kids in the back of the class.
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:08.640]   I love it.
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:12.040]   Oh yeah, the little parking margarine cup attached to the end of a bag is going to be
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:15.840]   real useful shoulder rolling at 500 miles an hour.
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.400]   Yeah, I can see that happening.
[00:16:18.400 --> 00:16:20.720]   Netflix is going to start streaming movies as well.
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:24.880]   Now this is something that you won't be able to do will, but those of us who live in the
[00:16:24.880 --> 00:16:29.440]   States will be able to, next to the ad button where you add a movie to your Netflix queue,
[00:16:29.440 --> 00:16:30.800]   press a play button on some movies.
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:34.080]   We'll actually be able to watch it on the net.
[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:36.480]   We actually had a viewer email us in about this.
[00:16:36.480 --> 00:16:41.160]   It's very similar to a lot of the existing systems except like cinema now kind of or.
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:45.320]   Yeah, except that apparently Netflix spent $40 million developing this one.
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:46.320]   Wow.
[00:16:46.320 --> 00:16:51.440]   PC only, I internet explorer only, WMV based encryption.
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:52.680]   It looks like or feels like.
[00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:53.680]   It would have to be.
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:16:54.680]   They'd have to be.
[00:16:54.680 --> 00:16:55.680]   There's no way they'd allow that.
[00:16:55.680 --> 00:16:58.000]   But you can stop and start and switch films, right?
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   Well, yeah.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:01.800]   And that's what's kind of interesting is they're charging it based on the amount of time you
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:06.200]   physically watch the movie, which means you have to be logged into the net every time
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:07.200]   you want to watch the movie.
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.200]   Right.
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:09.920]   Because it has to revalidate the DRM.
[00:17:09.920 --> 00:17:12.040]   Yeah, because it's essentially streaming.
[00:17:12.040 --> 00:17:15.640]   So you're not going to be able to like, you know, purchase a movie or rent a movie and
[00:17:15.640 --> 00:17:18.320]   then, you know, drive up to the ski house and watch it there.
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:21.440]   You're going to have to have broadband connection anywhere you are.
[00:17:21.440 --> 00:17:25.000]   Sid Hastings, the CEO of Netflix said, "We've got to have a second act.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:27.880]   Everybody agrees DVDs aren't going to last forever."
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:32.160]   Is this a legitimate second act or is this just a, I mean, lots of other players as you
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:33.320]   point out in order to do it?
[00:17:33.320 --> 00:17:37.440]   Well, they're in an interesting position in that they already have, you know, I've heard
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:40.800]   numbers as high as 6 million regular subscribers to their service.
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:41.800]   Wow.
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:45.800]   So if all of those 6 million subscribers or even a small percentage or, you know, a
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:50.640]   martyr percentage of the 6 million subscribers have broadband, that could give them a pretty
[00:17:50.640 --> 00:17:54.200]   huge leg up over all of these online services.
[00:17:54.200 --> 00:17:56.000]   That said, they suffer from the same problems.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.320]   They're claiming they'll be near instantaneous starting, but people have noted, if you write
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:01.640]   it out, you know, like I said, we had a viewer who wrote it.
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:03.800]   He said, "One movie started in like 30 seconds.
[00:18:03.800 --> 00:18:06.360]   It was a black and white Abbott Castello movie.
[00:18:06.360 --> 00:18:10.560]   You know, another movie which was, you know, a modern, you know, full color feature.
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:13.440]   It took about 15 or 20 minutes to queue before it started."
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:16.800]   That's my problem with all these offerings is they don't tend to have pirates of the
[00:18:16.800 --> 00:18:18.360]   Caribbean on these streams.
[00:18:18.360 --> 00:18:23.920]   Well, actually a lot of the, a lot of the, of the major ones, like the, you know, the
[00:18:23.920 --> 00:18:28.360]   movie link, "Cinnamon Out" type ones, are they starting to actually do have, they've
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:30.880]   had big movies on for a very long time.
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:36.720]   In fact, I believe movie link was actually started by the, like I think either movie link
[00:18:36.720 --> 00:18:40.800]   or "Cinnamon Out" or both were actually started by the studios.
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:49.080]   This, you know, this concept, this business model of taking Hollywood content, licensing
[00:18:49.080 --> 00:18:53.440]   that for distribution over the internet, I think is seriously flawed.
[00:18:53.440 --> 00:19:00.920]   The distribution costs are going to be enormous, just in bandwidth, to get this to the customer.
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:05.280]   And if they make any money, the first thing that Hollywood is going to do is renegotiate.
[00:19:05.280 --> 00:19:07.280]   You know, it's, it's a dead end.
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:09.120]   It's, it's just like iTunes.
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:12.440]   Of course, the, it's just like podcasts and video delivery online.
[00:19:12.440 --> 00:19:13.440]   I don't know.
[00:19:13.440 --> 00:19:14.440]   How are we different?
[00:19:14.440 --> 00:19:19.880]   It's, because we're willing to negotiate and, and deal with each other in a much more
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:21.480]   civilized manner.
[00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:24.000]   Hollywood is all about squeezing the last nickel.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.360]   So if you don't own the content that you're distributing, now you own your content, Leo,
[00:19:29.360 --> 00:19:30.360]   that you're distributing.
[00:19:30.360 --> 00:19:35.280]   So you're not going to rob yourself, you know, but Hollywood, you know, believe me,
[00:19:35.280 --> 00:19:37.320]   Apple does not make a lot of money per track.
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:39.040]   In aggregate, if you sell a billion songs.
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:40.040]   That's great.
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:42.240]   But it's not about the music and we know that.
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:43.240]   Right.
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:44.640]   It's not a profit deal for them.
[00:19:44.640 --> 00:19:45.640]   It's about selling iPods.
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:46.640]   Yeah.
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:47.640]   It's selling the hardware.
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:48.640]   Absolutely.
[00:19:48.640 --> 00:19:49.640]   Yeah.
[00:19:49.640 --> 00:19:50.640]   We're talking about squeezing every last.
[00:19:50.640 --> 00:19:52.800]   Are you going to bring up the zoom?
[00:19:52.800 --> 00:19:54.440]   Yeah, baby.
[00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:55.440]   Tell me about this.
[00:19:55.440 --> 00:19:56.440]   Is this just fraud?
[00:19:56.440 --> 00:19:57.440]   Well, okay.
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:58.440]   Go ahead.
[00:19:58.440 --> 00:19:59.440]   I mean, everybody knows right.
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:02.160]   The zoom, the zoom catchphrase is welcome to the social.
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.160]   Yeah.
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:06.400]   By the way, I found a, I found a nightclub in Toronto called the social.
[00:20:06.400 --> 00:20:08.760]   So I finally figured out what that means.
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:09.760]   It's just nightclub in Toronto.
[00:20:09.760 --> 00:20:10.760]   Yeah.
[00:20:10.760 --> 00:20:12.040]   They all want you to go there.
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:16.800]   No, but also we also know that, you know, Microsoft is, is pimping the zoom out to all
[00:20:16.800 --> 00:20:18.880]   the big studios to try and get some support.
[00:20:18.880 --> 00:20:21.320]   So you do the Sony's and whatever.
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:25.360]   Well, it turns out now that there are some.
[00:20:25.360 --> 00:20:30.680]   You can't squirt songs in the music catalog that you can't squirt.
[00:20:30.680 --> 00:20:31.680]   Not some.
[00:20:31.680 --> 00:20:32.680]   It's quite an.
[00:20:32.680 --> 00:20:35.960]   It's quite it's, it's somebody told me it's almost half.
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:36.960]   It's a huge number.
[00:20:36.960 --> 00:20:38.480]   So how pointless is that?
[00:20:38.480 --> 00:20:39.480]   You can't even squirt them.
[00:20:39.480 --> 00:20:42.040]   I mean, what kind of what these record companies are insane.
[00:20:42.040 --> 00:20:43.280]   The thing is so protected.
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:47.560]   You can only three days or three plays and they don't even want you to do that.
[00:20:47.560 --> 00:20:50.320]   Yeah, it's pretty, I mean, it's pretty bonkers.
[00:20:50.320 --> 00:20:54.240]   It's a bit of a, a half cut measure really, isn't it?
[00:20:54.240 --> 00:20:56.520]   Makes it look like even more of a gimmick than it was before.
[00:20:56.520 --> 00:20:57.520]   It's kind of stunning.
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:02.040]   Is it Sony that's one of the, it's universal and Sony, right?
[00:21:02.040 --> 00:21:03.040]   Universal.
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:07.320]   That's pretty much that covers a lot of material and you won't know.
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:09.320]   You can't tell until you try.
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:10.320]   Yeah, and gotcha.
[00:21:10.320 --> 00:21:13.920]   So there's roughly 40 to 50% of artists.
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:14.920]   Unbelievable.
[00:21:14.920 --> 00:21:21.280]   Whereas if they'd only made the zoom a little bit more compatible with MP3s and a little
[00:21:21.280 --> 00:21:25.320]   more easy to work with MP3s, I think it would gain a lot more traction.
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:26.880]   Hey, if they just supported me.
[00:21:26.880 --> 00:21:28.880]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:33.720]   Well, that's, you know, they brought these markets so quickly.
[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:37.240]   They knew from day one that podcasting was not going to be in the first release.
[00:21:37.240 --> 00:21:39.920]   And they will support it one way or the other, I'm sure.
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:44.920]   I mean, I talked to the product manager for Windows Media Play 11 last year at CES,
[00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:45.920]   CTIS 2006.
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:51.480]   And they said, yeah, we, we really want to have RSS and we should have RSS, but we
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:54.640]   don't and we're going to try to add it as quickly as possible.
[00:21:54.640 --> 00:21:58.560]   You know, and I was kind of sitting there just kind of like you're kidding me, right?
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:01.440]   You know, by the way, Adam, you might be interested.
[00:22:01.440 --> 00:22:06.160]   There are 100 pink zoons out there.
[00:22:06.160 --> 00:22:07.800]   You could go with your jumper.
[00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:10.560]   It's just random when you'll get one.
[00:22:10.560 --> 00:22:11.560]   Thanks, Lee.
[00:22:11.560 --> 00:22:12.560]   Always.
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:16.720]   I understand they're available on eBay if you, if you, if you really have to have it.
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:20.920]   I was at Fry's electronics in Concord, which of course is kind of a.
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:21.920]   Oh, that's a mecca.
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:22.920]   Yeah.
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:25.560]   Yeah, that is, that is a mecca when you're in Northern California.
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:30.560]   And I, it was the first time I was able to get my hands on a zoom and I was surprised.
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:34.160]   Of course, everyone else who's had, who's tried one knows this, but I was surprised
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:36.040]   that turn wheel doesn't turn.
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:37.040]   It's the first thing you do.
[00:22:37.040 --> 00:22:38.040]   Up, down, left, right.
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:39.840]   Yeah, I was like, huh, it's not working right.
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:41.640]   And then I figured it out.
[00:22:41.640 --> 00:22:42.640]   Yeah.
[00:22:42.640 --> 00:22:46.000]   I like the zoom in a lot of ways I like the zoom, but I think it's clear now that this
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   DRM thing is just broken.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.320]   Well, I played room one for the first time.
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:51.320]   It's C.S. this year.
[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:52.320]   I hadn't seen it before.
[00:22:52.320 --> 00:22:53.320]   I want to maze me with it.
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:56.240]   It was basically like like the first iPod.
[00:22:56.240 --> 00:22:57.240]   Yeah.
[00:22:57.240 --> 00:22:58.240]   Like it feels like that, doesn't it?
[00:22:58.240 --> 00:22:59.240]   Like the first iPod.
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:01.440]   Kind of big and clunky and yeah, you're right.
[00:23:01.440 --> 00:23:02.440]   Yeah.
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:04.240]   It's pretty clean though.
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.240]   I like the UI.
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:07.600]   I wish there was the word podcaster in the UI.
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:12.240]   So you think, Patrick, that they will at some point release an update to the zoom that
[00:23:12.240 --> 00:23:13.720]   suddenly they'll see that word pod.
[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:15.240]   Well, they use the word podcast?
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:20.120]   Well, part of the issue with podcasts is they don't, they don't currently have RSS support
[00:23:20.120 --> 00:23:21.640]   and Windows Media Player 11.
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:26.920]   And like I said before, that's something they were aware of being a major flaw on Windows
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:29.680]   Media Player 11 12 months ago.
[00:23:29.680 --> 00:23:31.880]   So they're being P11s out.
[00:23:31.880 --> 00:23:32.880]   It'd be nice to see them.
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:36.720]   Maybe after Vista ships, they'll finally turn around and, you know, because without the
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:39.480]   RSS integration, you know what I mean?
[00:23:39.480 --> 00:23:40.480]   Without the RSS.
[00:23:40.480 --> 00:23:41.480]   No, it has to aggregate.
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:42.480]   Yeah.
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:44.560]   Patrick, you can use juice.
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:47.480]   You can use the iPod or, you know, juice.
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:49.760]   Well, there's a reason, such a huge number.
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:54.480]   Like 40% of the people downloading at least 40% of the PC downloading.
[00:23:54.480 --> 00:23:55.480]   They use iTunes.
[00:23:55.480 --> 00:23:56.480]   Yeah.
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:58.480]   Because it's built in for DLTV.
[00:23:58.480 --> 00:23:59.480]   These iTunes.
[00:23:59.480 --> 00:24:00.480]   Patrick?
[00:24:00.480 --> 00:24:01.480]   Yeah.
[00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:07.440]   Do you think that the reason why Microsoft has been so in limbo about RSS in Media Player
[00:24:07.440 --> 00:24:15.760]   and the Zoom is because they were supposed to be using this central RSS repository in
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:21.320]   Vista that is under the hood and that no longer got support and it's just everyone's confused
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:23.320]   about where they should be getting it from?
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:24.320]   That would certainly be a start of it.
[00:24:24.320 --> 00:24:28.960]   But I also want to say, I was surprised at how fervent they were about, you know, getting
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:34.160]   RSS built into IE7, you know, as part of their sort of checklist for things they were
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:37.400]   two years late on capturing up to Firefox with.
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:42.720]   It would make sense though if they'd relied upon a central capability in Vista and it was
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:47.280]   one more thing yanked out of Vista that, well, all the plans are now on the back burner because
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:48.840]   they can't count on it.
[00:24:48.840 --> 00:24:49.840]   That's fine.
[00:24:49.840 --> 00:24:50.840]   I think this will probably happen.
[00:24:50.840 --> 00:24:51.840]   Yeah, that makes sense.
[00:24:51.840 --> 00:24:58.000]   I would like to see you, Adam and other new media people really kind of put some pressure.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:03.160]   Certainly, I've been outspoken on Microsoft to really make this priority to put this into.
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:07.280]   Let me tell you a little story, Leo.
[00:25:07.280 --> 00:25:14.560]   Before Apple integrated podcasting into iTunes, well before that, probably six months, my
[00:25:14.560 --> 00:25:20.080]   partner and I, Ron Bloom, we went to Microsoft and we had a number of conversations and we
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:27.000]   talked about, we actually were willing to put our developers to work, to put a headless
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:34.600]   version of iPod or Juicif you will into something that we would install, that would be on Windows,
[00:25:34.600 --> 00:25:36.920]   we had all these conversations.
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:40.120]   What is, you know, at that point it was like it's definitely coming in the next release
[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:46.040]   of Windows Media Player and then we didn't hear anything and then Apple called and said
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:50.400]   you had the exact same spiel to them and they just did it and they just integrated it.
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:51.960]   Yeah, cool, goes to Apple.
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:54.200]   And quite honestly, I'm really tired.
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:57.480]   Why the hell should I have to push Microsoft?
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:58.480]   It's impossible.
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.120]   You can't push that company to do it.
[00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:04.160]   But I'll tell you why because 95% of the world's using it.
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:06.680]   If they don't support it, we're going to hit a seal.
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:11.680]   I think we've hit the ceiling and we can't go much beyond that until it's kind of on
[00:26:11.680 --> 00:26:13.400]   the desktop and win Windows.
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:19.200]   Well that's true but you have to look at how many people use iTunes on Windows.
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:22.560]   It's very well saying, you know, 95% of people use Windows.
[00:26:22.560 --> 00:26:26.280]   How many Windows users are using iPod and therefore using iTunes?
[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:31.800]   Well, every iPod user on Windows is using iTunes and so is it really a ceiling?
[00:26:31.800 --> 00:26:38.760]   We see about 70% of all downloads that are iTunes related coming from the Windows version.
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:42.320]   It used to be 50/50 and now it's about 70%.
[00:26:42.320 --> 00:26:45.960]   I think our numbers are something similar although it's almost 90% of their listeners
[00:26:45.960 --> 00:26:48.720]   are using iTunes on some platform.
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:51.720]   I just think we need an ecology here.
[00:26:51.720 --> 00:26:56.320]   It's Apple's so dominant and again kudos to Apple for stepping up and doing it.
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:58.000]   I'm not complaining about that at all.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   I want to see Michael.
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:00.640]   Where are the open source guys outside of?
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:05.200]   I mean here's what I think happened where we went wrong.
[00:27:05.200 --> 00:27:08.800]   Juice formerly known as iPod or Lemon.
[00:27:08.800 --> 00:27:10.480]   Which you wrote the first version of?
[00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:15.120]   Yeah, well I didn't write any of that code because it was in Python initially.
[00:27:15.120 --> 00:27:20.640]   Well I wrote an Apple script and then it went to Python and PHP or so now it's Python I
[00:27:20.640 --> 00:27:22.640]   think.
[00:27:22.640 --> 00:27:27.160]   What I think they did wrong there is they then turned it into a player and that really
[00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:28.560]   confuses a lot of people.
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:33.240]   It was just the utility which was what my original script was just hidden and doesn't
[00:27:33.240 --> 00:27:36.440]   do anything but maybe notify you of what it's doing.
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:40.080]   I think that's where they went wrong because creating a player is very, very difficult
[00:27:40.080 --> 00:27:41.080]   business.
[00:27:41.080 --> 00:27:44.360]   And you don't need to because there is a player.
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:45.360]   There's plenty of players.
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:46.360]   There's plenty of players.
[00:27:46.360 --> 00:27:47.360]   There's plenty of players.
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:48.360]   Our Windows Media Player.
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:50.880]   I think the more it looks like our Windows the better and that's why I'd like to see Microsoft.
[00:27:50.880 --> 00:27:54.440]   But you think the open source community could step up and provide a solution that people
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:55.440]   would adopt?
[00:27:55.440 --> 00:28:02.880]   Well you're one of two ways as maybe someone revisits the whole concept of juice and creates
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:09.560]   a new version that somehow makes it clearer to users and how it integrates with their Facebook.
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:10.880]   With extension it's a widget.
[00:28:10.880 --> 00:28:15.120]   It just does it and then Media Player takes over.
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:19.720]   Or conversely the open source community of course could easily create a kick ass player
[00:28:19.720 --> 00:28:25.600]   but what I typically find is that it just misses the beautiful art that Apple cranks
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:26.600]   out.
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:27.600]   It just never looks right.
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:32.600]   There's Songbird which is pretty gorgeous but it's hard to get people to download that.
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:35.160]   It certainly hasn't hurt Apple.
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:40.560]   They reported on Wednesday that their first quarter profit was up 78% exceeding Wall Street's
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:48.520]   expectations of profit of $1 billion with apologies to Dr. Evil.
[00:28:48.520 --> 00:28:50.920]   That's a buck 14 a share.
[00:28:50.920 --> 00:28:55.720]   iPod sales $21 million in a quarter.
[00:28:55.720 --> 00:28:56.720]   That's pretty astounding.
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:29:00.440]   Total iPod sales $90 million since October 2001.
[00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:01.880]   That's pretty cool.
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:04.640]   Do you remember the cassette Walkmans?
[00:29:04.640 --> 00:29:05.640]   Yeah Sony.
[00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:07.640]   We've been through this before.
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:08.640]   You think it'll happen?
[00:29:08.640 --> 00:29:09.640]   The same thing will happen?
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:13.360]   Something else will come along or will somebody make a better iPod?
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:18.000]   Well I was thinking about this the other day and I remember when you just had to have
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:19.560]   the Walkman.
[00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:22.840]   And if you didn't have the Sony Walkman you had the cheesy kind.
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:25.160]   It's exactly, you got the shitty headphone.
[00:29:25.160 --> 00:29:26.160]   Sorry Leo.
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:27.160]   You got the crappy headphones.
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:28.160]   Can I say crap?
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:29.400]   You got the crappy headphones.
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:36.640]   You don't have the new Dolby DBX noise reduction.
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:42.400]   And then something along the way happened and I'm not quite sure what honestly.
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:44.320]   Then we tried the portable DVD players.
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:48.160]   That wasn't really too successful because there was too much skipping typically.
[00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:52.000]   So maybe it was just pent up demand that built over the years.
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:58.240]   I remember Patrick though when we saw the first hard drive MP3 players.
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:29:59.240]   Remember that?
[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:00.240]   What was it?
[00:30:00.240 --> 00:30:01.240]   EJV100.
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:02.240]   Yeah.
[00:30:02.240 --> 00:30:03.240]   That was pretty exciting.
[00:30:03.240 --> 00:30:04.240]   I have one.
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:05.240]   You too.
[00:30:05.240 --> 00:30:06.240]   It was amazing.
[00:30:06.240 --> 00:30:07.240]   Yeah.
[00:30:07.240 --> 00:30:09.320]   There was clearly something special about the idea of having that many songs in a device.
[00:30:09.320 --> 00:30:11.680]   It wasn't as small as an iPod but it was very exciting.
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:13.040]   Well it predated.
[00:30:13.040 --> 00:30:14.800]   It was before the iPod.
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:15.800]   Well before.
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:17.040]   Yeah you don't know why no.
[00:30:17.040 --> 00:30:19.880]   And then there was a company that was doing that with the in dash.
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:20.880]   Was it Q?
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:21.880]   What was the name of that?
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:22.880]   The MP3 car.
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:23.880]   MP3 car yeah.
[00:30:23.880 --> 00:30:24.880]   Or car MP3.
[00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:31.960]   I wonder if some of the impetus for Apple's iPhone is not to be there when that time has
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:37.280]   come that when the iPod reaches end of life to have something have the next thing.
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:38.280]   Is it that's possible?
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:40.600]   Is it the way the goal is?
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:44.960]   Maybe it's just having another next thing.
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:45.960]   Right.
[00:30:45.960 --> 00:30:48.880]   I don't know what most positioning it for sure is the next thing.
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:56.080]   When you had the first Motorola flip phones in 1996, 1997 and everyone loved it and it
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:01.440]   was the coolest thing to have then all of a sudden they were completely out of style.
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:05.000]   They were also breaking because you'd open it and the lid would flip off in the space
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.680]   and stuff.
[00:31:06.680 --> 00:31:09.360]   But now the flip phone is without a doubt is back.
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:10.360]   It's fashion.
[00:31:10.360 --> 00:31:12.520]   Leo it's just fashion.
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:15.360]   Yeah it's a very good point and it's hard to influence fashion.
[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:20.880]   I mean I don't think Apple any more than anybody else has a handle on how to do that.
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:24.480]   Ah but wait this is where Steve Jobs is brilliant.
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:28.880]   He brings in Bono the epitome of rock and roll in fashion.
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:35.480]   I mean I don't agree with his fashion sense but yeah exactly very debatable but coming
[00:31:35.480 --> 00:31:38.880]   out with a red iPod for the red brand.
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:40.720]   That's a huge fashion statement.
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:44.320]   That doesn't explain why John Mayer keeps showing up at the keynotes though.
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:45.320]   I don't understand that at all.
[00:31:45.320 --> 00:31:46.320]   Well that's also Steve's weird.
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:50.840]   I mean Steve's been obsessed with rock stars forever and he's got this sort of NPR target
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:53.000]   audience for all of his recent creations.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   That's true.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   Yeah that's a good point.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   Dude he's doing a show.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.200]   You've got to have different opening and closing acts sometimes.
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:00.600]   Kanye West was great.
[00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:04.240]   I love that but John Mayer I can do with that.
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:05.240]   I don't know maybe.
[00:32:05.240 --> 00:32:11.280]   Well the question is I mean can they get nobody at Apple could have known that the iPod is
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:12.280]   going to explode.
[00:32:12.280 --> 00:32:13.280]   No.
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:18.840]   Like if you gave this headline to Apple you know five years ago they would go huh.
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:20.880]   You know what we make most of our money on what?
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:21.960]   A music player.
[00:32:21.960 --> 00:32:23.840]   We are not Apple computer ink.
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:26.360]   We're just Apple ink huh.
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:28.720]   Although Max sales were up 40% too.
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:30.520]   I mean Max sales did well.
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:34.840]   Yeah but it's also I mean it's also it's a big quarter for spending for a lot of people
[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:37.200]   to do it for the first time in a while.
[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:38.680]   Everybody wasn't looking around going.
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:42.800]   Like Max sales grew a double the growth of overall PC market.
[00:32:42.800 --> 00:32:45.600]   I mean it was a good quarter for Apple.
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:48.480]   Yeah but it'll be curious to see what the next quarter is like.
[00:32:48.480 --> 00:32:49.480]   People were waiting for Vista.
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:52.200]   A lot of pent up demand is coming out.
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:55.800]   You think they'll be glad they waited for Vista Patrick.
[00:32:55.800 --> 00:32:57.880]   Oh I don't know.
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:05.880]   Vista's I you know Vista's Vista's better than Windows ME.
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:09.440]   You know Walt Mossberg in the journal this week said something that kind of surprised
[00:33:09.440 --> 00:33:11.400]   me because lately he's been a bit of an Apple cheerleader.
[00:33:11.400 --> 00:33:14.040]   He said this is the best version of Windows ever.
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:15.040]   And frankly I'd agree with him.
[00:33:15.040 --> 00:33:21.640]   I mean it's very impressive but it's and then he goes on to say but it's still Windows.
[00:33:21.640 --> 00:33:25.000]   Cold but hard but fail.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:29.560]   He said it's more I mean and this is true too.
[00:33:29.560 --> 00:33:32.160]   I mean and I think Microsoft has to respect its DNA.
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:34.280]   It's more Windows.
[00:33:34.280 --> 00:33:37.360]   It's not going to be a revolution.
[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:43.200]   Well part of what's interesting is you kind of take a look at where the I'm going to send
[00:33:43.200 --> 00:33:50.240]   my apologies out to the entire open source community to sort of prevent a flood of email.
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:54.680]   If you step away from Linux and BSD and the other open source operating systems and you
[00:33:54.680 --> 00:33:59.000]   basically look at the two highest profile operating systems out there.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.480]   And again don't send me emails saying more people are using Linux and OS 10.
[00:34:02.480 --> 00:34:03.880]   I don't care for the purposes of this.
[00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:04.880]   Is that true?
[00:34:04.880 --> 00:34:07.040]   Well I don't know.
[00:34:07.040 --> 00:34:08.640]   Somebody is asserting that however.
[00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:13.040]   So I'm certainly going to get email if I say that OS 10 is more popular.
[00:34:13.040 --> 00:34:16.680]   If you look at the way I mean actually more people are using World of Warcraft as their
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:18.600]   base operating system or any other.
[00:34:18.600 --> 00:34:20.760]   Or at least to occupy most of their day.
[00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:22.920]   And how about that guy that got the levels?
[00:34:22.920 --> 00:34:25.240]   Burning Crusade baby.
[00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:30.520]   I was going to rename to it to the Burning Crusade but then they did that and I couldn't
[00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:31.520]   so I'm very disciplined.
[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:37.680]   All I'm thinking is like in the era of cyber war France is going to clean up.
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:41.520]   So we should explain the Burning Crusade and then we can get back to your because we've
[00:34:41.520 --> 00:34:44.760]   now gone completely down our at hole.
[00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:48.960]   The newest fracture the first expansion pack for World of Warcraft is out.
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:53.160]   Burning Crusade allows you to go to a whole new world and allows you to go from the top
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:58.360]   60 to 70 now which is one betta.
[00:34:58.360 --> 00:35:03.240]   It's the version of 11 for World of Warcraft users and I just want you to know I am not
[00:35:03.240 --> 00:35:04.240]   a geek.
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:07.560]   I am a level 12 paladin baby.
[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:09.680]   And that's poor casual players.
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:10.680]   Somebody did that.
[00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:13.120]   Somebody did that in yeah I'm a very casual player.
[00:35:13.120 --> 00:35:17.160]   Somebody did that you said in 28 hours of French fellow did that 10 leveled up 10.
[00:35:17.160 --> 00:35:18.160]   From 50 to 70.
[00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:19.160]   Unbelievable.
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:20.480]   I had like the whole thing I put it on YouTube.
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:22.040]   Is it on YouTube?
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:23.040]   I'm pretty sure.
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:25.400]   A 28 hour mirror.
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:26.840]   Perhaps they fast forwarded through it.
[00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:27.840]   All right.
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:29.440]   So that's the Burning Crusade rat hole.
[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:33.160]   Let's get back to what you were saying which was I forgot something about Linux.
[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:37.360]   Well looking at the way the two major players like I think in the in the public's mind there's
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:41.040]   two major players right now for personal operating systems and there's Apple and there's
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:45.200]   Microsoft and Apple's you know they've always you know every three years they they wipe
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:49.600]   off an entire generation of hardware and now they're basically doing these sort of annual
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:53.480]   you know little more than annual updates to OS 10.
[00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:57.640]   And you know they charge you up what's starting to look more and more like a fair amount if
[00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:03.240]   a video game can cost 60 bucks an operating system at 120 doesn't sound too bad versus
[00:36:03.240 --> 00:36:08.480]   the sort of massive attempts to rewrite Microsoft's operating system coupled with a massive
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:09.480]   cost to upgrade.
[00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:14.080]   What is it like for most people it'll be at least 100 and many 200 and more right.
[00:36:14.080 --> 00:36:15.080]   Yeah.
[00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:16.080]   To get to ultimate anyway.
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:21.400]   Yeah ultimate's ultimate's fascinating but you know I mean it's you know we're what
[00:36:21.400 --> 00:36:24.040]   two weeks less than two weeks away at this point from the release.
[00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:25.040]   That's right.
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:26.040]   The consumer version.
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:27.040]   Yeah.
[00:36:27.040 --> 00:36:29.680]   Actually I wonder if anybody's pre-ordered for that but it's just it's such a it's such
[00:36:29.680 --> 00:36:31.560]   a very different you know.
[00:36:31.560 --> 00:36:35.560]   Apple's kind of like hey we've got the you know we've got the the foundation is good we've
[00:36:35.560 --> 00:36:38.880]   got these open source cats that are doing great things with the kernel and we're just
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:39.880]   going to keep plugging away.
[00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:43.840]   I'm excited about leopard I think it's got a long way off.
[00:36:43.840 --> 00:36:49.760]   Interesting twist however to this Apple story you know that all the core two Macs have come
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:56.000]   with it turns out airport cards that could do 802.11 and it does require a firm.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.120]   It requires a firmware patch and Apple's claiming that it's Sarbanes Oxley that's making them
[00:37:01.120 --> 00:37:02.520]   charge a buck 99.
[00:37:02.520 --> 00:37:07.960]   It's some weird accounting rule that since they've already booked the revenue from selling
[00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:11.920]   these machines if they're going to upgrade I don't buy this anybody buy this they figured
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:15.520]   to upgrade the capabilities of machine they have to charge you a buck 99 what.
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:17.080]   Well I can't say.
[00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:18.640]   I think it's true.
[00:37:18.640 --> 00:37:22.200]   Adam did you study accounting in school because we needed some help here.
[00:37:22.200 --> 00:37:26.280]   Well no but I did run my own public company so that's all.
[00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:29.720]   Well this is before socks.
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:32.840]   I mean Sarbanes Oxley is class weird.
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:33.840]   Yeah.
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:36.120]   As somebody like one of my best friends this is an accountant if you want to hear him sort
[00:37:36.120 --> 00:37:38.920]   of go off in strange directions just bring up socks.
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:45.160]   This was the US law that came in after the Enron scandal to will one hoped to add transparency
[00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:47.160]   and accounting.
[00:37:47.160 --> 00:37:54.520]   It used to be much easier to indeed if you so from what I understand of it and I certainly
[00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:57.400]   don't tend to be an expert or know everything about it.
[00:37:57.400 --> 00:38:01.160]   They did recognize the revenue from this in advance which of course is something that
[00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:07.880]   props up your 10Q and your quarterly numbers and I think it used to be a lot easier to
[00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:11.800]   explain that away later without charging the customer afford.
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:16.720]   I don't understand when I download an update to software for free doesn't that add value
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:20.160]   to the software and wasn't that revenue already recognized.
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:21.360]   I don't get it.
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:28.880]   Well I think this is something to follow because if this is a trend then it may very well be
[00:38:28.880 --> 00:38:34.120]   that you have to pay for this stuff or it has to be accounted for some way directly with
[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:38.680]   the consumer instead of between balance sheets within a corporation that could be pretty
[00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:39.680]   messed up.
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:41.720]   So I do have my eye on this one.
[00:38:41.720 --> 00:38:45.800]   Well see that's actually got a pretty good article written up on this and they're saying
[00:38:45.800 --> 00:38:49.160]   basically this was a choice of how to book the revenue.
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:54.040]   And they're probably a little bit conservative given the options scandal the SEC is looking
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:55.040]   closely at them.
[00:38:55.040 --> 00:38:57.520]   This might be a good time to toe the line.
[00:38:57.520 --> 00:38:59.120]   Here's another thought.
[00:38:59.120 --> 00:39:03.960]   Is it possible this is a licensing issue that if you know they put something in that
[00:39:03.960 --> 00:39:05.360]   they have to pay for?
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:09.480]   Yeah they have to pay for a per user essentially if it's activated.
[00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:12.040]   It does seem a rather token amount.
[00:39:12.040 --> 00:39:17.760]   I mean Apple probably will have some revenue from this but not a significant amount.
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:18.760]   I'll pay it.
[00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:19.760]   It's a buck 99.
[00:39:19.760 --> 00:39:24.520]   I mean I'll pay it to get an in my Macbook Pro but it's just an odd thing to do.
[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:29.400]   The good news is the current the new US Congress is apparently reevaluating Sarbanes Oxley.
[00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:35.160]   So maybe this is something that we're in deep kimchi with Sarbanes Oxley.
[00:39:35.160 --> 00:39:36.160]   Are you?
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:38.800]   Another word for crap Leo.
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:40.880]   You know I mean this is really horrible.
[00:39:40.880 --> 00:39:43.880]   All the IPO market has gone overseas.
[00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:47.640]   It's in London is thriving now and just look at the you know the dollar.
[00:39:47.640 --> 00:39:49.160]   Is that what happened to the Ipio?
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:51.480]   We haven't had an Ipio in years.
[00:39:51.480 --> 00:39:53.680]   You know certainly no tech Ipio in years.
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:55.240]   Nobody wants to do it.
[00:39:55.240 --> 00:39:56.240]   No ten of you.
[00:39:56.240 --> 00:40:00.040]   Even Go Daddy came right up to the line and said whoa and backed off.
[00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:01.040]   Yep.
[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:02.040]   And that's because of socks.
[00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:03.320]   Oh absolutely.
[00:40:03.320 --> 00:40:04.320]   Very interesting.
[00:40:04.320 --> 00:40:06.600]   Well it sounds like a bad law if it's if it's doing.
[00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:08.760]   Well we're on the topic of bad laws.
[00:40:08.760 --> 00:40:11.360]   I was going to go with that.
[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:14.560]   I've had to mission and sort of data rate and things.
[00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:19.120]   I was absolutely amazed to see this month but the latest issue of Playboy has got a two
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:24.520]   page editorial on net neutrality FCC and bandwidth utilization.
[00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:27.640]   Well I only read it for the pictures so I miss must have missed that.
[00:40:27.640 --> 00:40:30.080]   Well the article was written three months ago.
[00:40:30.080 --> 00:40:31.080]   Has it changed now?
[00:40:31.080 --> 00:40:36.000]   Well no that's their lead time is three months.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.160]   Oh I see it was a big story three months ago.
[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:44.080]   I mean I thought it's amazing that the tech community has done such a great job of making
[00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:49.160]   such a who hard at this that it can reach something as completely mainstream as Playboy.
[00:40:49.160 --> 00:40:52.920]   Well I don't know if it was the tech community so much as the content community that makes
[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:54.880]   it a huge noise about it.
[00:40:54.880 --> 00:40:56.360]   I thought it was Tricia Helfer.
[00:40:56.360 --> 00:41:00.160]   Playboy makes a lot of money online.
[00:41:00.160 --> 00:41:04.640]   Yeah I mean it's certainly in there yeah absolutely in their interest to keep an eye on it.
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:08.240]   They certainly took their time and sort of you know I mean what was the gist of the
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:10.680]   what was the gist of the article?
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:15.640]   It was just basically saying how absolutely useless the FCC was how it was in the grasp
[00:41:15.640 --> 00:41:19.480]   of all the big content companies and that it was giving you know it was Tricia's diff
[00:41:19.480 --> 00:41:24.920]   users effectively by selling out to all these people and that the FCC had gone that had
[00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:30.560]   lost its remit of public service and it basically become a sort of business evangelist.
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:36.720]   Well I think this whole net neutrality debate has been a very futile one and I don't I'm
[00:41:36.720 --> 00:41:40.440]   not even sure I understand what people are trying to communicate with net neutrality
[00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:45.680]   nor do I believe that these people understand what networking is and what it costs to make
[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:49.960]   a network and to maintain it and how do you say these people who do you mean they mean
[00:41:49.960 --> 00:41:56.000]   the Congress or do you mean no everybody who was yelling screaming about net neutrality.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:01.200]   Well you think that you're in the AT&T court on this one.
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:09.120]   No I'm not necessarily in either court but I do know a lot about networking and when
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:14.200]   you see what it looks it's all about money it's very expensive to set up a network and
[00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:19.040]   if you have lots of traffic that means more switches bigger switches that comes at a huge
[00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:28.720]   cost so I'm not necessarily against ISPs and telcos charging the content providers for
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:29.720]   that distribution.
[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:34.960]   Oh but it sounds like then you've got this kind of toll road this gerrymandered network
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:38.440]   where every time you want to go somewhere you've got to pay a little fee because we've
[00:42:38.440 --> 00:42:39.440]   got toll roads everywhere.
[00:42:39.440 --> 00:42:48.360]   I'm also not worried about the sheer force of human beings to get something if they want
[00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:54.280]   it no matter if they have to beg, steal or borrow to get it.
[00:42:54.280 --> 00:42:58.280]   There will be alternatives but we already have a toll road.
[00:42:58.280 --> 00:43:01.480]   I pay for bandwidth going out and you pay for bandwidth coming in.
[00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:03.240]   The toll road is already there.
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:04.240]   There's nothing new here.
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:05.240]   But let's not add more.
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:08.040]   The AT&T the toll road needs to be paid for.
[00:43:08.040 --> 00:43:13.640]   But we're paying for it now and it's a variable cost and it's competition.
[00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:16.040]   Adam we're arguing on the same side.
[00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:21.880]   And AT&T basically claims that they can't deliver the...
[00:43:21.880 --> 00:43:22.880]   Well they've down ironically...
[00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:24.440]   They think you think you're paying for it.
[00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:26.200]   Ironically they've kind of backed off on this.
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:28.320]   They said we'll never do that.
[00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:30.640]   We didn't mean that and we don't want to do it.
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:31.920]   Oh I think they will Leo.
[00:43:31.920 --> 00:43:38.400]   I think they will most definitely do it but they won't do it to people who are providing
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:46.800]   media and other content peer to peer or one to few or even one to many.
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:53.000]   It'll really come companies like YouTube, PODShow, Google, Twitmay have to deal with
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:56.920]   that as well because you're just pushing tremendous amounts of bandwidth through their
[00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:57.920]   system.
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:44:00.400]   So basically let me see if I got this straight Adam.
[00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:07.080]   I'm paying Comcast a bloody fortune for my connectivity which I can't actually reach
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:11.640]   with any single provider that can actually saturate that connection because I don't
[00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:15.240]   deserve to get the bandwidth I think I'm paying for.
[00:44:15.240 --> 00:44:18.440]   Well I don't think anyone has said it's exactly going to be like that.
[00:44:18.440 --> 00:44:23.640]   I think that there's been talk of prioritization packets.
[00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:28.400]   Not reach and have a different priority or two different things.
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:35.800]   I think that there will definitely be levels of the so-called toll road that will depend
[00:44:35.800 --> 00:44:41.520]   upon amount of media, quality of media and consistency that is being sent down the pipe.
[00:44:41.520 --> 00:44:46.120]   I don't think anyone is going to get cut off and I don't think the consumer.
[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:52.120]   We already have all kinds of restrictions on running servers, on your ISP connections.
[00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:54.000]   This has been around for a long, long time.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:58.840]   I'm talking about getting the download speed I think I'm paying for.
[00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:00.680]   I think that's a different issue.
[00:45:00.680 --> 00:45:06.760]   We have thousands of users that find themselves dealing with packet shaping issues on the ISP
[00:45:06.760 --> 00:45:07.760]   level.
[00:45:07.760 --> 00:45:13.720]   But this is a misnomer because when people, it's been marketed incorrectly or maybe very
[00:45:13.720 --> 00:45:14.800]   correctly.
[00:45:14.800 --> 00:45:20.960]   When someone sells you an 8 megabit connection and you see a video coming down at 2 megabits
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:25.720]   per second, there's a lot of stuff in the middle that 8 megabit connection has no control
[00:45:25.720 --> 00:45:26.720]   over.
[00:45:26.720 --> 00:45:28.160]   I'm not talking about 8 megabits at 2 megabits.
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:32.040]   I'm talking about people being throttled to 20 or 50k.
[00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:36.600]   Is this the seeing 500k to a megabit suddenly finding themselves?
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:39.720]   And not because they've hit a monthly cap in the amount they're allowed to download, the
[00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:44.040]   people universally suddenly can't get downloads paid from certain sites higher.
[00:45:44.040 --> 00:45:46.320]   Well, this is already happening.
[00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:50.080]   This is already happening because their networks can't handle the amount of traffic.
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:56.840]   Is this the old argument though that we can't sustain flat rate pricing on data.
[00:45:56.840 --> 00:45:59.360]   We've got to go back to per bit pricing.
[00:45:59.360 --> 00:46:03.120]   I mean, isn't that something people would like to do too?
[00:46:03.120 --> 00:46:05.520]   Wouldn't that solve the issue?
[00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:07.120]   Customers want flat rate.
[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:09.360]   Just look at cell phone plans.
[00:46:09.360 --> 00:46:15.080]   When networking started, we came up with this whole idea of appearing agreement precisely
[00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:19.880]   because the telcos didn't really have the capability or the horsepower at the time to
[00:46:19.880 --> 00:46:23.400]   be able to calculate every bit that passed through their routers and who would belong
[00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:28.720]   to like they were used to doing with telephone minutes because there's something at the end
[00:46:28.720 --> 00:46:32.880]   of every month that's called settlement and all the telcos exchange all their records.
[00:46:32.880 --> 00:46:34.000]   And hey, I paid you.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:35.240]   I sent this much your way.
[00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:37.320]   You sent this much my way.
[00:46:37.320 --> 00:46:41.960]   We're going to either wash it out or we owe me money or I owe you money.
[00:46:41.960 --> 00:46:46.600]   And these peer agreements started basically by saying, look, we can't count it, but we
[00:46:46.600 --> 00:46:50.200]   can't see exactly what's coming through you or is directed towards you, but it's kind
[00:46:50.200 --> 00:46:51.200]   of the same amount.
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:52.440]   So we're peers.
[00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:58.120]   And so yes, I think the only way to do it is to go back to actual packet counting.
[00:46:58.120 --> 00:46:59.120]   At a cost.
[00:46:59.120 --> 00:47:02.160]   I mean, that means all of a sudden you're putting switches and routers everywhere.
[00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:03.160]   You're measuring everything.
[00:47:03.160 --> 00:47:05.360]   There's some bottlenecking.
[00:47:05.360 --> 00:47:08.480]   At the end of the day, though, I think the consumer will win a big time.
[00:47:08.480 --> 00:47:13.680]   I think exactly the opposite, the consumer at home is going to get fantastic throughput
[00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:15.320]   from anything they want.
[00:47:15.320 --> 00:47:19.520]   Well, you know, it's funny if they're willing to pay for it and their ISP is willing to
[00:47:19.520 --> 00:47:20.520]   buy.
[00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:26.480]   I mean, we have listeners in Sweden who continually tell me, oh, hey, we get 100 megabit downloads
[00:47:26.480 --> 00:47:27.880]   for 20 bucks a month.
[00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:29.680]   Why is it so cheap there?
[00:47:29.680 --> 00:47:31.720]   It's subsidized by the government.
[00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:33.440]   The government's paying for it.
[00:47:33.440 --> 00:47:35.000]   Is that what you wanted, Bill?
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   Thank you.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   Sure.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:40.400]   And I think our government should pitch in to in fact, I believe that's part of the net
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:45.080]   neutrality debate is that there was lots of money allocated towards the telcos.
[00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:46.080]   Interesting.
[00:47:46.080 --> 00:47:48.640]   And they were supposed to build out their networks and they didn't really do it.
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:52.920]   And I think that's where a lot of this, a lot of anger stems from.
[00:47:52.920 --> 00:47:57.360]   But yeah, this is just important to me as the electricity grid or the water network,
[00:47:57.360 --> 00:48:02.200]   why wouldn't the government at least have some involvement or set some type of regulation?
[00:48:02.200 --> 00:48:04.160]   I'm not against that.
[00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:08.520]   And just in case you think this is a dead issue, the new Congress has in fact reintroduced
[00:48:08.520 --> 00:48:14.240]   a net neutrality bill, a pro net neutrality bill I might add and as long as we're just
[00:48:14.240 --> 00:48:18.160]   pandering towards constituents because they don't know what the hell they're talking about.
[00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:21.040]   It was a series of tubes.
[00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:25.560]   So you're saying it's us that's dumb and Ted Stevens knew what he was talking about.
[00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:27.000]   He was right on the money, man.
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:28.960]   He sent the truck my way just this morning.
[00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:30.560]   I got the internet smoking.
[00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:36.640]   There's a new bill actually, as long as we're talking about Congress, the Senate introduced
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:41.360]   a bill called the platform, I should say the US Senate introduced a bill called the platform
[00:48:41.360 --> 00:48:45.080]   equality and remedies for rights holders and music act, a nice acronym that stands for
[00:48:45.080 --> 00:48:46.680]   perform.
[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:51.120]   This is a bill that died, an RIA bill that died last year.
[00:48:51.120 --> 00:48:54.960]   It would require content protection on all satellite radio broadcasts.
[00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:59.520]   You might be interested in this Adam since you do stuff on Sirius along with cable and
[00:48:59.520 --> 00:49:01.120]   internet broadcasts.
[00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:06.400]   Broadcasters would be required to use reasonably available and economically reasonable technology
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:09.240]   to prevent music theft.
[00:49:09.240 --> 00:49:15.000]   Another misunderstood conversation that has produced a knee-jerk reaction.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:20.160]   You've done a lot for POD Safe Music with your POD Safe Network.
[00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:21.800]   It's exactly that's the point.
[00:49:21.800 --> 00:49:23.840]   That's what this is about.
[00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:26.120]   It's about licensing and money.
[00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:33.760]   There's huge forces at work who make money based upon the reuse of content, musical works,
[00:49:33.760 --> 00:49:39.720]   the publishing predominantly, but also the replication rights.
[00:49:39.720 --> 00:49:41.240]   It's always been a nice little game.
[00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:43.400]   You have 6,000 radio stations.
[00:49:43.400 --> 00:49:47.280]   They all have to pay X amount based upon how many listeners they have.
[00:49:47.280 --> 00:49:53.240]   The way that money is divided within the performing rights societies, ASCAP BMI has always been
[00:49:53.240 --> 00:49:58.960]   a very fuzzy black box, but the people who want to make money are making the money.
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:04.240]   The POD Safe Music Revolution did is say, "Hey, that's fine.
[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:09.240]   We want your stuff protected and we don't necessarily believe in DRM.
[00:50:09.240 --> 00:50:16.040]   Just trust your co-licency agreement partners on this, mainly podcasters, and give your
[00:50:16.040 --> 00:50:21.840]   stuff for free and let them play it and we'll tell you when it was played and then you can
[00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:25.240]   go and build your business and everything's fair."
[00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:27.160]   There's no money exchanging hands though.
[00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:29.080]   So it's only about life-
[00:50:29.080 --> 00:50:30.080]   Sure.
[00:50:30.080 --> 00:50:32.960]   It's merely just so that they know what's going on.
[00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:35.960]   I mean, they're getting value in terms of promotional value.
[00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:39.520]   They're getting huge value.
[00:50:39.520 --> 00:50:46.360]   Not just financial value, but there is a tremendous social reward.
[00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:50.600]   If you've got a recommendation like, "Oh, you were looking for the Rolling Stones," you
[00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:56.040]   might want to check out Brother Love and I listened to a song and maybe I'd buy a CD.
[00:50:56.040 --> 00:51:03.560]   But when a creator of a product like a song is played on a show, basically someone who's
[00:51:03.560 --> 00:51:07.680]   telling his thousand friends or more, "Hey, check this out.
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:09.040]   I really love this guy.
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:13.040]   In fact, I love so much him to play it back to back five times."
[00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:14.680]   That is a great feeling.
[00:51:14.680 --> 00:51:15.680]   That's what motivates people.
[00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:20.480]   I think more than money and from one, typically you can create the other.
[00:51:20.480 --> 00:51:21.960]   Brother Love's very happy.
[00:51:21.960 --> 00:51:26.280]   I know he's got a lot of notoriety now and it's done a great thing for him, I think.
[00:51:26.280 --> 00:51:29.080]   Hey Will, you had some stories that you wanted to bring up.
[00:51:29.080 --> 00:51:32.080]   Have we covered them or I'm looking for them and I don't see them here.
[00:51:32.080 --> 00:51:35.080]   I put them in the full twit.
[00:51:35.080 --> 00:51:36.080]   Ah, they're in full twit.
[00:51:36.080 --> 00:51:37.080]   We'll bring them up.
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:38.080]   Tell me what you would like to say.
[00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:39.800]   I can't remember what it is, man.
[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:40.800]   All right, I'll have to.
[00:51:40.800 --> 00:51:42.600]   I'm still looking at Tricia Helfer's layout and playboy.
[00:51:42.600 --> 00:51:47.760]   So let me load delicious speaking up.
[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:49.520]   Which was shot three years ago.
[00:51:49.520 --> 00:51:50.520]   Was it really?
[00:51:50.520 --> 00:51:51.520]   Of course.
[00:51:51.520 --> 00:51:52.520]   Took forever.
[00:51:52.520 --> 00:52:02.040]   Now that she's a star on Battlestar Galactica, poor kid, Apple says Cisco lawsuit is silly.
[00:52:02.040 --> 00:52:05.480]   Apple actually has an interesting loophole.
[00:52:05.480 --> 00:52:09.920]   Apparently Cisco held that trademark for iPhone for six years before they released an
[00:52:09.920 --> 00:52:14.280]   iPhone just before Apple did, hoping to revive the trademark.
[00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:19.360]   But the Patent and Trade Office says over nine different organizations have claimed
[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:21.120]   ownership over the iPhone patents.
[00:52:21.120 --> 00:52:22.880]   Yeah, that's what Apple said as well.
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:27.040]   So I think Apple's going to get away with it and Cisco's trademark is going to look like
[00:52:27.040 --> 00:52:29.760]   it's not going to get it because they didn't use it for too long.
[00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:30.760]   They didn't use it.
[00:52:30.760 --> 00:52:35.200]   And also there's a great video on YouTube of Steve Borma.
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:39.520]   I'm sort of being asked about the iPhone and he puts on this really stupid, like,
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:45.000]   affected, kind of snort, laugh hybrid and looks like complete idiot.
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:49.480]   It really looks like he's actually quite nervous about the iPhone and is doing his
[00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:53.040]   best to make it not seem so.
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:54.560]   It's pretty hilarious.
[00:52:54.560 --> 00:52:56.280]   Should I play a little bit of that?
[00:52:56.280 --> 00:52:57.280]   Yeah, go on.
[00:52:57.280 --> 00:53:02.280]   Steve, let me ask you about the iPhone and the Zoom, if I may.
[00:53:02.280 --> 00:53:07.800]   Zoom was getting some traction and Steve Jobs goes to Macworld and he pulls out this iPhone.
[00:53:07.800 --> 00:53:10.800]   What was your first reaction when you saw that?
[00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:14.640]   Five hundred dollars fully subsidized with a plan.
[00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:19.120]   I said, that is the most expensive phone in the world and it doesn't appeal to business
[00:53:19.120 --> 00:53:21.560]   customers because it doesn't have a keyboard.
[00:53:21.560 --> 00:53:22.560]   He almost sounds like he's crying.
[00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:23.560]   I'll be honest with you.
[00:53:23.560 --> 00:53:24.560]   He doesn't think that's a good thing.
[00:53:24.560 --> 00:53:29.560]   He doesn't sound too happy about that.
[00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:30.560]   He's almost...
[00:53:30.560 --> 00:53:36.520]   He says something really interesting there though about the keyboard which I'm very interested
[00:53:36.520 --> 00:53:37.520]   in as well.
[00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:39.520]   I have not held an iPhone.
[00:53:39.520 --> 00:53:42.560]   I do have a Nokia N800 internet tablet.
[00:53:42.560 --> 00:53:44.080]   You love that thing.
[00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:45.720]   You've been raving about that thing.
[00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:50.240]   Yeah, and at first I thought this on screen keyboard was really no good because you have
[00:53:50.240 --> 00:53:52.480]   no tactile response.
[00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:59.280]   But I've forced myself to relearn how to use a different type of keyboard.
[00:53:59.280 --> 00:54:05.480]   I have to say it's kind of growing on me and to hear Balmer laugh like that I think he
[00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:06.480]   has to be careful.
[00:54:06.480 --> 00:54:07.480]   Well, he's also...
[00:54:07.480 --> 00:54:08.480]   I mean that's classic.
[00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:10.480]   Balmer kind of redirect.
[00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:12.200]   Well, but he makes a point.
[00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:13.200]   It's very expensive.
[00:54:13.200 --> 00:54:14.200]   There is no keyboard.
[00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:18.440]   Everybody's kind of conditioned to the trio blackberry model where you have a little keyboard.
[00:54:18.440 --> 00:54:20.160]   Although Jobs addressed that in his...
[00:54:20.160 --> 00:54:23.160]   He said we don't think this is a good idea.
[00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:26.800]   I did talk to David Poga the New York Times who actually typed on the thing for about 20
[00:54:26.800 --> 00:54:29.000]   minutes and said it's very hard to type on.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:32.040]   Yeah, but it takes a lot longer than 20 minutes to get used to.
[00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:33.360]   I'm a blackberry fiend.
[00:54:33.360 --> 00:54:35.240]   I actually gave that up for my Nokia.
[00:54:35.240 --> 00:54:36.240]   What is it?
[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:37.240]   E61 which has...
[00:54:37.240 --> 00:54:45.640]   It does have a regular keyboard but it's not in the patented fan configuration.
[00:54:45.640 --> 00:54:47.560]   So that took me a little while to learn.
[00:54:47.560 --> 00:54:48.560]   I don't know.
[00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:54.360]   I was pretty much against the whole on-screen keyboard and user interface.
[00:54:54.360 --> 00:54:56.560]   I'm starting to back out a little bit.
[00:54:56.560 --> 00:54:59.960]   Did you have a 70 or is this 800 that are first?
[00:54:59.960 --> 00:55:00.960]   No, I did not.
[00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:01.960]   This is...
[00:55:01.960 --> 00:55:04.160]   I would never buy anything like that.
[00:55:04.160 --> 00:55:08.840]   Nokia sent me this and I was happy to try it out and I'm quite enamored with what it
[00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:09.840]   does.
[00:55:09.840 --> 00:55:10.840]   It's basically...
[00:55:10.840 --> 00:55:11.840]   It's very small.
[00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:13.560]   It's almost a little tablet but it's not a full-sized tablet.
[00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:14.960]   It's a small screen.
[00:55:14.960 --> 00:55:17.040]   It's a small screen but what's nice about it...
[00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:18.040]   There's two things.
[00:55:18.040 --> 00:55:22.240]   One is it doesn't have a phone integrated but it communicates with your phone through
[00:55:22.240 --> 00:55:26.200]   Bluetooth so you can get a wireless data connection.
[00:55:26.200 --> 00:55:30.680]   It does all the remembering of your Wi-Fi points and switches automatically but the
[00:55:30.680 --> 00:55:34.840]   most interesting thing about it and I don't hear anyone, this whole conversation about
[00:55:34.840 --> 00:55:37.440]   iPhone being open or closed.
[00:55:37.440 --> 00:55:38.960]   The Nokia is open.
[00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:39.960]   It's Linux.
[00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:43.640]   It's built on Debian, I think, Debian flavor of Linux.
[00:55:43.640 --> 00:55:47.360]   There's an active developer community creating applications for it.
[00:55:47.360 --> 00:55:53.440]   It's got GPS in the chip, it's even got radio in the chip, it's got an onboard camera,
[00:55:53.440 --> 00:55:54.640]   it's got all the things that...
[00:55:54.640 --> 00:55:56.440]   It's immensely slow though.
[00:55:56.440 --> 00:55:58.440]   No, no, not at all.
[00:55:58.440 --> 00:56:03.880]   You've tried that X scale with Swiss and those both generations and it just seems...
[00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:08.640]   It takes incredible occupations to wait for even basic web pages to load.
[00:56:08.640 --> 00:56:10.440]   Really on the N800?
[00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:11.440]   Yeah.
[00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:14.040]   No, no, that hasn't bothered me at all.
[00:56:14.040 --> 00:56:15.040]   I have to say...
[00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:16.600]   What do you use it for?
[00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:18.240]   Is it for going about town or...?
[00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:19.240]   Yeah, good question.
[00:56:19.240 --> 00:56:26.160]   No, I use it for basically for Gmail and if I just want to look at something, I download
[00:56:26.160 --> 00:56:29.240]   podcasts with it and listen to them on the device.
[00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:30.960]   But I will say I use the...
[00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:36.680]   Even though it has a full functioning opera browser inside which supports Flash 7 which
[00:56:36.680 --> 00:56:43.280]   is also quite nice for a Linux-based device.
[00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:48.160]   I use Gmail mobile which of course loads really fast and just works.
[00:56:48.160 --> 00:56:51.560]   But you can drag the screen around with your fingers so you don't have to necessarily use
[00:56:51.560 --> 00:56:52.560]   scroll bars.
[00:56:52.560 --> 00:56:57.600]   You can just tap, hold and move a webpage left, right and up down any direction you want.
[00:56:57.600 --> 00:56:58.600]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:56:58.600 --> 00:56:59.600]   That's kind of like a really fun, really.
[00:56:59.600 --> 00:57:05.160]   Yeah, so you're really using your hands to do more with the interface than a mouse click
[00:57:05.160 --> 00:57:06.160]   and point.
[00:57:06.160 --> 00:57:09.200]   It's interesting and I think there is something to explore there.
[00:57:09.200 --> 00:57:12.800]   I think that's one of the things people were very interested in with the iPhone and the
[00:57:12.800 --> 00:57:17.840]   Safari browser on the iPhone and maybe we are entering a new world of a touchscreen user
[00:57:17.840 --> 00:57:19.400]   interfaces.
[00:57:19.400 --> 00:57:21.760]   Maybe there's some progress to be made there.
[00:57:21.760 --> 00:57:26.400]   Well, it's open-source so I think developers should go to what is it?
[00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:33.400]   Mabo.org, M-A-E-B-O.org and jump in because people are creating stuff.
[00:57:33.400 --> 00:57:36.400]   Let me ask you about this Patrick, you work for Ziff Davis.
[00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:41.120]   According to a hard OCP, Ziff is going to be broken up and sold.
[00:57:41.120 --> 00:57:43.160]   Bids do, we're due on Friday.
[00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:44.960]   Do you know anything about that?
[00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:50.680]   Yeah, this is an eight month old story that I've apparently just picked up on.
[00:57:50.680 --> 00:57:52.320]   There's nothing, they didn't add anything new.
[00:57:52.320 --> 00:57:54.600]   They said that the PC and gaming division will be broken up.
[00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:55.600]   That's not new.
[00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:57.600]   Well, there is no PC and gaming division.
[00:57:57.600 --> 00:58:01.120]   There's three divisions to the companies, the enterprise, consumer and small business
[00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:03.120]   in the gaming division.
[00:58:03.120 --> 00:58:05.520]   The gaming division is the gaming magazines and what up.com.
[00:58:05.520 --> 00:58:06.600]   The enterprise is...
[00:58:06.600 --> 00:58:07.600]   They picked this up by the...
[00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:08.760]   E-Point and et cetera.
[00:58:08.760 --> 00:58:12.440]   From the post, the New York Post.
[00:58:12.440 --> 00:58:13.440]   What's...
[00:58:13.440 --> 00:58:16.480]   They've been shopping all three divisions.
[00:58:16.480 --> 00:58:22.040]   I think the books have been shopped for the gaming division and enterprise already.
[00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:25.200]   The final division being shopped is the consumer and small business division.
[00:58:25.200 --> 00:58:28.480]   Which does it impact you at all?
[00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:30.960]   Well, how many sales do we go through?
[00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:31.960]   Do you need a tech TV?
[00:58:31.960 --> 00:58:32.960]   That'd be two.
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:35.640]   I went through my last Ziff Davis sale.
[00:58:35.640 --> 00:58:38.400]   I'm not going through anymore Ziff Davis sales.
[00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:40.800]   I went through three or four.
[00:58:40.800 --> 00:58:41.800]   Three or four.
[00:58:41.800 --> 00:58:42.800]   Yeah.
[00:58:42.800 --> 00:58:43.800]   Tech TV was sold in the first.
[00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:47.640]   I started it in '94 when it was still owned by the Ziff family.
[00:58:47.640 --> 00:58:49.480]   Yeah, someone built Ziff on it.
[00:58:49.480 --> 00:58:50.480]   Two of them.
[00:58:50.480 --> 00:58:52.720]   Built Ziff to a holding company, to a holding company.
[00:58:52.720 --> 00:58:55.520]   To Softbank, to Paul Allen.
[00:58:55.520 --> 00:58:56.520]   Paul Allen.
[00:58:56.520 --> 00:58:57.520]   Paul Allen.
[00:58:57.520 --> 00:58:58.520]   I left before Comcast.
[00:58:58.520 --> 00:59:00.280]   No, I guess I didn't leave before Comcast.
[00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:02.160]   No, you were out right before that closed.
[00:59:02.160 --> 00:59:03.160]   Was it just before that closed?
[00:59:03.160 --> 00:59:04.160]   All right.
[00:59:04.160 --> 00:59:05.960]   A good thing to let me tell you, I'm happy.
[00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:07.800]   I have some Ziff Davis related news.
[00:59:07.800 --> 00:59:08.800]   Oh, yes?
[00:59:08.800 --> 00:59:14.880]   Well, former Ziff Davis employee Natalie Del Conte will start her own video new show
[00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:18.520]   called Tech Check on PodShow in a couple of weeks.
[00:59:18.520 --> 00:59:19.520]   Excellent.
[00:59:19.520 --> 00:59:22.120]   How many shows are on PodShow now?
[00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:24.120]   You have any idea?
[00:59:24.120 --> 00:59:30.240]   Yeah, on the network itself, we have 5,000 and of those 5,000, about 500.
[00:59:30.240 --> 00:59:36.200]   We have expanded agreements with and who are making upfront money, etc.
[00:59:36.200 --> 00:59:37.200]   That's impressive.
[00:59:37.200 --> 00:59:40.640]   Now, is she making upfront money or is she doing this on spec?
[00:59:40.640 --> 00:59:44.200]   Oh, she's doing, Natalie is working for us full time on this.
[00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:45.200]   Okay.
[00:59:45.200 --> 00:59:48.960]   So she was in a tech crunch?
[00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:49.960]   Tech crunch.
[00:59:49.960 --> 00:59:50.960]   Interesting.
[00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:52.240]   I almost got Mike Harrington on this.
[00:59:52.240 --> 00:59:56.040]   Maybe that's why he didn't want to go on.
[00:59:56.040 --> 01:00:00.600]   He wouldn't let her work for PodShow and work for TechCrunch.
[01:00:00.600 --> 01:00:02.480]   He considers us a competitor.
[01:00:02.480 --> 01:00:04.680]   That's exactly why I mentioned that you'd be on Adam.
[01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:05.680]   All right.
[01:00:05.680 --> 01:00:06.680]   Just curious.
[01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:08.680]   The juice is on the loose.
[01:00:08.680 --> 01:00:10.480]   How many of you have played with the juice?
[01:00:10.480 --> 01:00:11.320]   And what do you think of it?
[01:00:11.320 --> 01:00:17.680]   This is the new venture from Skype, full screen, television network via streaming.
[01:00:17.680 --> 01:00:18.960]   I have to say, pretty impressive.
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:21.960]   The user interface especially is just gorgeous.
[01:00:21.960 --> 01:00:25.760]   A bit tech does a review of it.
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:28.920]   Let's first ask Nick.
[01:00:28.920 --> 01:00:29.920]   What do you think?
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:30.920]   What do you say about the juice?
[01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:31.920]   How do you like juice?
[01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:32.920]   You were the one who put the story in.
[01:00:32.920 --> 01:00:39.560]   Do you know what I think it's really interesting because it's a recognition of what I think
[01:00:39.560 --> 01:00:44.280]   is one of the big areas of content to come, which is like this mid-tail of content.
[01:00:44.280 --> 01:00:45.720]   If you take like...
[01:00:45.720 --> 01:00:47.720]   Not long tail, but you need tail.
[01:00:47.720 --> 01:00:48.720]   Yeah.
[01:00:48.720 --> 01:00:51.280]   You know, if you've got the top of the tail, as it were, is like, you know, your fox and
[01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:57.200]   the 24 and lost them, whatever, you've got, you know, YouTube and cat in toilet at the
[01:00:57.200 --> 01:00:58.640]   far end.
[01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:02.440]   And in the middle, you've got, you know, this kind of professional grade programming that
[01:01:02.440 --> 01:01:05.880]   is, you know, possibly interest, you know, sort of specific.
[01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:07.800]   And it's really, really interesting.
[01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:12.280]   And juice is going around, really trying to roll up some of that stuff and get it online
[01:01:12.280 --> 01:01:17.760]   and create, you know, real sort of like a TV browser and a TV channel.
[01:01:17.760 --> 01:01:20.560]   But on your computer, made up of this really kind of interesting content.
[01:01:20.560 --> 01:01:25.640]   And I think it's going to be a great home for the kind of the dignations and the Mac
[01:01:25.640 --> 01:01:26.640]   breaks.
[01:01:26.640 --> 01:01:28.640]   Well, right now you're even seeing much music on it.
[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:31.280]   You're seeing some world poker tour on there.
[01:01:31.280 --> 01:01:35.080]   Adam, you said, you sound like you had some thoughts about this.
[01:01:35.080 --> 01:01:36.920]   Are you?
[01:01:36.920 --> 01:01:37.920]   Yeah.
[01:01:37.920 --> 01:01:40.040]   I have not been able to use it.
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:43.280]   I'm still waiting for my beta user password.
[01:01:43.280 --> 01:01:45.120]   As are a lot of people.
[01:01:45.120 --> 01:01:46.120]   Yeah.
[01:01:46.120 --> 01:01:47.120]   I'm obviously aware of it.
[01:01:47.120 --> 01:01:50.320]   There's a couple things that are wrong with this.
[01:01:50.320 --> 01:01:56.720]   One, it appears to me that they are soliciting mainstream content and building a basically
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:02.840]   a television service, which technically I'm sure is going to be extremely well received.
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:07.040]   And I think the experience will be great.
[01:02:07.040 --> 01:02:11.880]   So you know, we go right back to my example of making no money on Hollywood content.
[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:13.080]   So I think that's a mistake.
[01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:20.440]   And then from what I have read about their business model in mainstream publications,
[01:02:20.440 --> 01:02:27.280]   I read that they're going with a form of AdSense type model, trying to provide relevancy,
[01:02:27.280 --> 01:02:30.960]   not just based upon the content, but based upon who you are.
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:35.080]   So a lot of pie in the sky type stuff, which is not, you know, it's, again, it's not the
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:38.160]   brand advertising I think everyone's looking for.
[01:02:38.160 --> 01:02:41.360]   So I'd have to really see, you know, it all comes down to the content, you know, at the
[01:02:41.360 --> 01:02:45.400]   end of the day, look at what people are willing to watch on crappy YouTube.
[01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:51.920]   You know, so can you give me the same hilarious stuff on this beautiful high, high death type
[01:02:51.920 --> 01:02:52.920]   experience?
[01:02:52.920 --> 01:02:56.080]   Do you think they should go with the user generated content?
[01:02:56.080 --> 01:03:00.720]   Well, their distribution, you know, they've always relied on other people to create the
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:01.720]   content.
[01:03:01.720 --> 01:03:03.800]   Skype is the same thing because I was the same thing.
[01:03:03.800 --> 01:03:08.200]   So other people providing the content has made them very successful.
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:11.520]   I think now they're stepping into a game, which I just don't know if there's a game to be
[01:03:11.520 --> 01:03:12.520]   had.
[01:03:12.520 --> 01:03:19.720]   The other issue from what I understand is that this thing will chew up two to 300 megabytes
[01:03:19.720 --> 01:03:26.520]   of data transferred down and 150 megabytes of data transferred up if you are within the
[01:03:26.520 --> 01:03:27.680]   network.
[01:03:27.680 --> 01:03:32.360]   So I have my doubts about how that's going to sit with our ISP friends.
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:36.000]   But at the end of the day, I've poo-pooed both of them in the past.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:45.040]   I met them when they were building Kazab because they were stationed in Amsterdam.
[01:03:45.040 --> 01:03:49.000]   And at the time, I thought, man, these wacky guys are out of their mind.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:51.280]   And I was very wrong about that.
[01:03:51.280 --> 01:03:55.200]   So they're definitely not stupid and they know how to get press.
[01:03:55.200 --> 01:03:57.240]   But they're good programmers.
[01:03:57.240 --> 01:04:00.040]   I think in each case, they've written really good software.
[01:04:00.040 --> 01:04:01.040]   This is just as beautiful.
[01:04:01.040 --> 01:04:02.040]   Wait till you see it.
[01:04:02.040 --> 01:04:03.040]   It's beautiful.
[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:05.600]   I think it was all they do that in Romania, I think.
[01:04:05.600 --> 01:04:06.880]   I don't know if they still do it that way.
[01:04:06.880 --> 01:04:09.880]   But that's how they built a lot of Skype.
[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:14.040]   Because it was just the two of them sitting in an office in Amsterdam and all their engineers
[01:04:14.040 --> 01:04:16.720]   were in Romania.
[01:04:16.720 --> 01:04:21.120]   But again, is this what we're waiting for?
[01:04:21.120 --> 01:04:24.240]   Are we waiting to be able to see the office?
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:27.160]   You could watch the office.
[01:04:27.160 --> 01:04:29.560]   It's like, no, I don't think so.
[01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:34.080]   Even downloadable videos, I have to question stuff.
[01:04:34.080 --> 01:04:36.200]   What is the success of video on the internet?
[01:04:36.200 --> 01:04:38.640]   No one can deny that it's YouTube.
[01:04:38.640 --> 01:04:41.800]   And in general, although it's possible, people aren't downloading.
[01:04:41.800 --> 01:04:44.000]   They're just viewing in web browsers.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:49.240]   And it's some combination of it being simple, it working every single time.
[01:04:49.240 --> 01:04:53.520]   But for it to be content being funny, it sure doesn't have to stop playing on my web
[01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:56.920]   browser and start playing on my TV.
[01:04:56.920 --> 01:04:58.480]   Well I think it's two different things.
[01:04:58.480 --> 01:05:01.800]   The television is morphing dramatically.
[01:05:01.800 --> 01:05:02.800]   It's become flat.
[01:05:02.800 --> 01:05:03.800]   It's become big.
[01:05:03.800 --> 01:05:04.800]   It's on the wall.
[01:05:04.800 --> 01:05:06.000]   It's like a piece of art.
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:07.680]   It's delivering sports.
[01:05:07.680 --> 01:05:09.640]   It's delivering news.
[01:05:09.640 --> 01:05:17.560]   It's delivering a cinema experience, which is why I'm not too high on the whole Netflix
[01:05:17.560 --> 01:05:19.200]   streaming.
[01:05:19.200 --> 01:05:26.920]   I don't think it's too much trouble for people to go and get a HD DVD if they're going to
[01:05:26.920 --> 01:05:27.920]   watch a movie.
[01:05:27.920 --> 01:05:32.640]   Do you think that the economy is on the good TV is for premium content?
[01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:35.120]   The computer is for YouTube style.
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:37.040]   No, no, no, no.
[01:05:37.040 --> 01:05:38.040]   Don't get me wrong.
[01:05:38.040 --> 01:05:42.720]   When you say premium content, I think I'm talking about quality.
[01:05:42.720 --> 01:05:49.800]   So you can't watch a sports game really effectively on your computer with today's technology.
[01:05:49.800 --> 01:05:53.960]   You want to watch sports on a big ass screen with a whole bunch of your buddies around
[01:05:53.960 --> 01:05:56.960]   drinking beer, you know, and it's got to have great sound.
[01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:58.560]   And it's a whole different type of experience.
[01:05:58.560 --> 01:06:06.120]   And very, very costly to make, you know, it's 13 to 20 cameras on any good day at any
[01:06:06.120 --> 01:06:07.120]   game.
[01:06:07.120 --> 01:06:09.400]   This is just an expensive proposition.
[01:06:09.400 --> 01:06:14.160]   But what's interesting, Adam, is until YouTube, the biggest purveyor video online was actually
[01:06:14.160 --> 01:06:19.800]   major league baseball, who were taking the rights over the broadcast to stream them online
[01:06:19.800 --> 01:06:22.640]   and make them available and charge money for them.
[01:06:22.640 --> 01:06:25.240]   Well, interim step, I think.
[01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:27.000]   And it's a little different than a lot of sports.
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:28.360]   You know, it's not NASCAR.
[01:06:28.360 --> 01:06:29.840]   It's not football.
[01:06:29.840 --> 01:06:31.560]   It's not soccer.
[01:06:31.560 --> 01:06:35.200]   Baseball times can be a very, very slow game.
[01:06:35.200 --> 01:06:39.400]   And that kind of fits in with what you can parse through today's technology and what you
[01:06:39.400 --> 01:06:41.000]   can actually parse with your eyes.
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:46.000]   But if a movie is the same thing, yeah, I think there will be a lot.
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:49.360]   I watch all kinds of movies streaming through Windows Media Player.
[01:06:49.360 --> 01:06:50.720]   I've got my porn accounts.
[01:06:50.720 --> 01:06:51.720]   You know, I watch that.
[01:06:51.720 --> 01:06:54.680]   And it's exactly what I want, you know, and they pay per minute.
[01:06:54.680 --> 01:06:55.680]   Fantastic.
[01:06:55.680 --> 01:07:02.000]   I watch a movie that $30 million to $100 million went into to create.
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.680]   I really enjoy it much more if I'm watching that in an HD experience.
[01:07:05.680 --> 01:07:08.040]   I'm not arguing against the evidence.
[01:07:08.040 --> 01:07:12.640]   Like there's certainly, there's some compelling arguments for streaming, live streaming and
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:13.640]   sporting events.
[01:07:13.640 --> 01:07:17.480]   And if major league baseball can make it work, I mean, it's interesting to think about what
[01:07:17.480 --> 01:07:22.160]   it costs to actually get a 500k or megabit stream, you know what I mean, to get it out
[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:23.160]   there to people.
[01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:27.040]   And it's going to cost in terms of either advertising revenue or people being willing
[01:07:27.040 --> 01:07:28.840]   to pay for the subscriptions.
[01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:32.560]   And that latter part paying for the subscriptions is kind of what made major league baseball
[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:33.560]   work.
[01:07:33.560 --> 01:07:36.600]   But you know, it's also a nurse and realize there's an entire generation that's been
[01:07:36.600 --> 01:07:41.480]   perfectly happy with Media Quality MP3s that they download.
[01:07:41.480 --> 01:07:45.600]   And you know, I mean, how many people have you run into that live off of content they
[01:07:45.600 --> 01:07:47.480]   download off of peer to peer?
[01:07:47.480 --> 01:07:51.320]   So I think you're right there about a major league baseball.
[01:07:51.320 --> 01:07:55.720]   But I think the reason, this just proves that the reason why people were willing to subscribe
[01:07:55.720 --> 01:08:00.080]   to major league baseball is to be able to see all the games they want to see.
[01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:05.000]   It wasn't, you know, because you just can't get access to the content, to all the content
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.480]   in your region.
[01:08:06.480 --> 01:08:09.400]   That's just the way everything's been set up.
[01:08:09.400 --> 01:08:14.120]   So that just proves that people will go to any extent to get content they really love.
[01:08:14.120 --> 01:08:17.440]   But television is much more a social experience.
[01:08:17.440 --> 01:08:19.840]   You know, you're watching a game with friends.
[01:08:19.840 --> 01:08:23.200]   You're watching a movie with your family or friends.
[01:08:23.200 --> 01:08:26.600]   You're using it as a screen for your for your Wii.
[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:29.840]   You know, this is it's just a different type of device and demands different content.
[01:08:29.840 --> 01:08:30.840]   It's not that hard.
[01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:34.000]   It's not that hard to bring online content onto the screen.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.480]   It's whether, you know, it's how long it's going to take.
[01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:36.480]   I mean, what's it?
[01:08:36.480 --> 01:08:41.960]   Hey, I was watching Studio 40 that downloaded from the internet on my Xbox 360 on my HD
[01:08:41.960 --> 01:08:42.960]   TV last night.
[01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:46.360]   That seems to me that seems like a perfect world.
[01:08:46.360 --> 01:08:49.200]   But we've got like 80% of our users download rather than streaming.
[01:08:49.200 --> 01:08:54.720]   It's a long format program in about 20, 25% actually already are watching on a television
[01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:56.120]   or an HD TV.
[01:08:56.120 --> 01:08:59.920]   I mean, one of the biggest demands we get is people want a light screen version and they
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:03.160]   want to hire they want basically a higher bit weight version that's going to look better
[01:09:03.160 --> 01:09:04.160]   on an HD TV.
[01:09:04.160 --> 01:09:06.280]   I think there's no question we're in a state of flux.
[01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:08.520]   It's kind of hard to predict exactly what's going to happen.
[01:09:08.520 --> 01:09:11.400]   I think you've both made good points, but we're going to wrap this up because we're at
[01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:15.320]   a time and you know what, Adam, I think you've got to come back.
[01:09:15.320 --> 01:09:17.080]   Oh, I'd love to.
[01:09:17.080 --> 01:09:19.280]   If you could pay pal me another 20 bucks.
[01:09:19.280 --> 01:09:21.120]   We got our 20 bucks worth.
[01:09:21.120 --> 01:09:24.520]   I'll tell you, even when you convert it to British pounds or euros or whatever the hell
[01:09:24.520 --> 01:09:26.400]   it is you guys use over there.
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:27.960]   I'm really glad you could be here.
[01:09:27.960 --> 01:09:32.520]   Of course, Podshow is Adam's great company and has done so much to help podcasters.
[01:09:32.520 --> 01:09:33.520]   I can't.
[01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:35.400]   When you say, what did you say?
[01:09:35.400 --> 01:09:37.160]   10,000 podcasts on this?
[01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:38.400]   5,000 on the network.
[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:40.560]   500 are making up front money.
[01:09:40.560 --> 01:09:41.560]   That's fantastic.
[01:09:41.560 --> 01:09:46.840]   That's just, you know, that's a great boon for those 500 and for the 5,000.
[01:09:46.840 --> 01:09:51.200]   And of course, anyone's welcome to join daily source code is Adam's own podcast.
[01:09:51.200 --> 01:09:53.480]   It has been since practically day one.
[01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:58.000]   I think it's actually the second podcast of all time.
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.000]   He's the pod father.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.720]   Adam, thank you for joining us.
[01:10:00.720 --> 01:10:01.720]   Thank you.
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:02.720]   One question.
[01:10:02.720 --> 01:10:03.720]   Were you wearing the pink jumper?
[01:10:03.720 --> 01:10:05.320]   No, I'm wearing the turquoise jumper actually.
[01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:06.320]   Thank you.
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:07.320]   Very nice.
[01:10:07.320 --> 01:10:09.320]   And of course the American audience is saying, what is all this about jumpers?
[01:10:09.320 --> 01:10:10.880]   They think you're wearing a mumu or something.
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:12.960]   It's just, it's just a sweater folks.
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:14.960]   It's just a sweater.
[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:19.160]   Mr. Will Harris, bit-tech.net is his website.
[01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:21.120]   He's the guy who gave us the pink jumper sighting.
[01:10:21.120 --> 01:10:22.760]   And thanks to you, we got Adam on.
[01:10:22.760 --> 01:10:25.440]   And it's great to hear from you as always.
[01:10:25.440 --> 01:10:28.200]   I get more email when you're on than almost anybody else.
[01:10:28.200 --> 01:10:31.680]   People really like hearing the international perspective.
[01:10:31.680 --> 01:10:33.280]   It's just the British accent.
[01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:34.280]   Nobody likes me.
[01:10:34.280 --> 01:10:35.280]   It's just the accent.
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:36.280]   It's true.
[01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:37.280]   We love the accent.
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:38.920]   You sound so intelligent, you know?
[01:10:38.920 --> 01:10:43.160]   And bit-tech.net is a great place to go to read up on a lot of these stories.
[01:10:43.160 --> 01:10:47.400]   And of course, Patrick Norton is the host of DL.TV.
[01:10:47.400 --> 01:10:50.360]   As long as if Davis can hold it together.
[01:10:50.360 --> 01:10:54.160]   But Patrick, you know there's always a home for DL.TV no matter where you, you know, whatever
[01:10:54.160 --> 01:10:55.160]   happens.
[01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:56.400]   I don't think that's any question about that.
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:58.480]   It's a great show with Robert Herron.
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:11:01.400]   And Leo, may I thank you for being such a fantastic host.
[01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:05.960]   It's very difficult having been involved with several of these type of round table shows.
[01:11:05.960 --> 01:11:08.880]   There's only three guests, but you do a great job at that.
[01:11:08.880 --> 01:11:11.480]   And my wife just creams over your voice.
[01:11:11.480 --> 01:11:18.360]   Well, while you're busy watching your pay-per-view porn, I might just come over and say hello.
[01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:20.560]   Oh, you got a deal, man.
[01:11:20.560 --> 01:11:21.560]   Twenty bucks.
[01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:22.560]   I'll send it back.
[01:11:22.560 --> 01:11:24.560]   Hey, it really is my show channel.
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:27.440]   It really has been a lot of fun.
[01:11:27.440 --> 01:11:28.440]   I thank you all.
[01:11:28.440 --> 01:11:29.440]   And I'm serious, Adam.
[01:11:29.440 --> 01:11:32.440]   I would love to have you on any time you're interested.
[01:11:32.440 --> 01:11:34.840]   You add considerably to the panel.
[01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:35.840]   And it's just really great.
[01:11:35.840 --> 01:11:36.840]   Well, thank you.
[01:11:36.840 --> 01:11:37.840]   I'd love to.
[01:11:37.840 --> 01:11:41.240]   And the only reason we just haven't hooked it up earlier is because I usually travel on
[01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:44.720]   Saturday and I ride Sunday and it's midnight where I am.
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:47.280]   Well, and million dollars.
[01:11:47.280 --> 01:11:51.960]   You don't get a million miles without doing a considerable amount of time in an airplane.
[01:11:51.960 --> 01:11:55.360]   Whether it's worth 13 or 15 million, it is not that important.
[01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:57.840]   Of course, Will is up and let's see.
[01:11:57.840 --> 01:11:58.840]   Let's see, Will now.
[01:11:58.840 --> 01:11:59.840]   What is it about?
[01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:00.840]   One in the morning there?
[01:12:00.840 --> 01:12:01.840]   Twenty plus twelve.
[01:12:01.840 --> 01:12:02.840]   Twelve nineteen.
[01:12:02.840 --> 01:12:03.840]   All right.
[01:12:03.840 --> 01:12:05.120]   I thank you for staying up late.
[01:12:05.120 --> 01:12:06.120]   Another twit.
[01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:07.120]   This is Weekend Tech.
[01:12:07.120 --> 01:12:09.120]   Is it McCann?
[01:12:09.120 --> 01:12:12.120]   This is a Krab.
[01:12:12.120 --> 01:12:16.120]   This is a Krab.
[01:12:16.120 --> 01:12:21.120]   This is a Krab.
[01:12:21.120 --> 01:12:23.120]   This is a Krab.
[01:12:23.120 --> 01:12:26.120]   This is a Krab.
[01:12:26.120 --> 01:12:29.120]   This is a Krab.
[01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:32.120]   This is a Krab.
[01:12:32.120 --> 01:12:35.120]   Everybody's at everywhere.
[01:12:35.120 --> 01:12:40.120]   This is a Krab.
[01:12:40.120 --> 01:12:42.120]   Thank you.
[01:12:42.120 --> 01:12:48.640]   This is my sense of coffee with my Splendeflavored blend and I'm going to sign up right now for
[01:12:48.640 --> 01:12:51.720]   a GoDaddy account and I'm ready.
[01:12:51.720 --> 01:12:54.320]   I love you.
[01:12:54.320 --> 01:12:58.040]   How come you're not in the GoDaddy Super Bowl commercial?
[01:12:58.040 --> 01:12:59.520]   My breast eyes is too small.
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:02.080]   Yeah, I noticed there were quite a few women in that.
[01:13:02.080 --> 01:13:03.920]   But he can't make one.
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:04.920]   They'll air yet.
[01:13:04.920 --> 01:13:06.920]   I think he's got one yet that they'll air.
[01:13:06.920 --> 01:13:09.920]   Well, but you certainly understand that doing that purposely.
[01:13:09.920 --> 01:13:10.920]   Right.
[01:13:10.920 --> 01:13:11.920]   And he's sure getting a lot of attention.
[01:13:11.920 --> 01:13:14.920]   Yeah, that's the way you're in the entire party.
[01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:18.720]   So I haven't talked to Callie, but I know she was in one of the early ones.
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:22.920]   Is she still in the later editions or is she one of the people who's the greatest?
[01:13:22.920 --> 01:13:28.920]   Well, Callie's commercial was more one of the brand imaging things they're doing where
[01:13:28.920 --> 01:13:31.920]   they want to approach a whole bunch of different markets.
[01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:37.920]   The whole vibe of GoDaddy is big-chested, all-American bombshell girls.
[01:13:37.920 --> 01:13:39.920]   But they are all-
[01:13:39.920 --> 01:13:41.920]   I look for when I look for a domain registrar.
[01:13:41.920 --> 01:13:43.920]   But I'll tell you, it's interesting.
[01:13:43.920 --> 01:13:51.920]   We have, on our homepage, is the GoDaddy Girl advertisement and we've done some surveys.
[01:13:51.920 --> 01:13:56.920]   And lots of people said, "Well, I saw this picture on the homepage that wasn't too short.
[01:13:56.920 --> 01:13:57.920]   What the site was about.
[01:13:57.920 --> 01:14:00.920]   I'm a little worried."
[01:14:00.920 --> 01:14:01.920]   What the hell?
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:03.920]   It's a fool's paradise.
[01:14:03.920 --> 01:14:05.920]   It is, it is, it is.
[01:14:05.920 --> 01:14:07.920]   This is amazing.
[01:14:07.920 --> 01:14:15.920]   In, in, in tech.
[01:14:15.920 --> 01:14:20.920]   Do it in a twin.
[01:14:20.920 --> 01:14:21.920]   Do it in a twin.
[01:14:21.920 --> 01:14:22.920]   Alright.
[01:14:22.920 --> 01:14:23.920]   Do it in a twin, baby.
[01:14:23.920 --> 01:14:24.920]   Do it in a twin.
[01:14:24.920 --> 01:14:25.920]   Alright.
[01:14:25.920 --> 01:14:27.920]   Do it in a twin, baby.
[01:14:27.920 --> 01:14:28.920]   Do it in a twin.
[01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:29.920]   Alright.
[01:14:29.920 --> 01:14:32.500]   (upbeat music)
