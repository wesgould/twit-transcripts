[00:01:42.600 --> 00:01:45.600]   So we have assembled some of our favorite Twitters.
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:47.800]   Can't say that.
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:48.800]   Trademark.
[00:01:48.800 --> 00:01:53.080]   Starting on my left, Mr. Jason Heiner of the Tech Republic, CBS Interactive.
[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:55.400]   Great to see you, Jason, in Knoxville, Tennessee.
[00:01:55.400 --> 00:01:56.400]   Louisville.
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.720]   Ah, yes, Louisville, Kentucky.
[00:01:58.720 --> 00:01:59.720]   Exactly.
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:00.720]   Kentucky.
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:01.720]   Always a pleasure.
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:02.720]   Always a pleasure.
[00:02:02.720 --> 00:02:03.720]   Got the wrong state and city this time.
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:04.720]   Yes.
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:05.720]   Louisville, Kentucky.
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:06.720]   Yes, sir.
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.680]   Nice to see you again, Jason.
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:10.120]   Happy holidays.
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.120]   Thank you.
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:13.360]   From, I'm going to get it wrong, Tucson, Arizona.
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:15.840]   Am I right, Mr. Ed bot?
[00:02:15.840 --> 00:02:16.840]   Not even close.
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:17.840]   Wrong city and state.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:19.840]   Santa Fe, New Mexico.
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:22.320]   It's the same.
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.360]   You see, I live in California, the only state that matters.
[00:02:26.360 --> 00:02:29.920]   And I, you know, I know you're somewhere down there in Sand Country.
[00:02:29.920 --> 00:02:31.760]   He's somewhere in Sippin, Bourbon Country.
[00:02:31.760 --> 00:02:33.720]   It doesn't really matter.
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:36.840]   And Patrick Bejaw, he's in Paris, France.
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.840]   That one I'm going to get right.
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.840]   Yeah.
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:39.840]   Yeah.
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:40.840]   There you go.
[00:02:40.840 --> 00:02:41.840]   That one, that one you can get right.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:42.840]   The capital of the world.
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:43.840]   Hello, everybody.
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:44.840]   I'm sorry.
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:45.840]   I apologize.
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.280]   You're Jason or Ed.
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:49.280]   I don't know.
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:51.280]   Do this every time and I apologize.
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:52.280]   I apologize.
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:55.720]   I mean, we would lose the entertainment value if you didn't.
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.720]   So there it is.
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:03:00.280]   I was listening to a book about Breaking Bad, really excellent book called Difficult Man
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:03.480]   about the Golden Age, Third Golden Age of Television.
[00:03:03.480 --> 00:03:08.720]   And it turns out that Breaking Bad's in New Mexico, it was going to be in the Valley,
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:09.920]   like the San Fernando Valley.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:12.640]   It's in New Mexico for one reason, only tax breaks.
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:13.640]   Right.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:15.160]   Turned out to be brilliant.
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.600]   I mean, that landscape really made Breaking Bad.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:25.680]   The stay of New Mexico was offering very nice subsidies to filmmakers and TV production
[00:03:25.680 --> 00:03:27.200]   companies at the time.
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:31.920]   And yeah, the landscape became a character on that series.
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:36.160]   Probably not what New Mexico was thinking, making it the meth capital of...
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:42.400]   Actually, if it was an upgrade for some parts of our reputation.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.920]   Well, that's the one thing you always see.
[00:03:45.920 --> 00:03:48.080]   There's a lot of trips out to the desert and it's beautiful.
[00:03:48.080 --> 00:03:49.360]   I mean, it just looks gorgeous.
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.000]   Well, come on down and visit sometimes.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   I shall.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.760]   So I've known Ed since for 20 years now.
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:00.800]   Since you started appearing regularly on Devorac on computers back in the '90s.
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:02.240]   Yes, indeed.
[00:04:02.240 --> 00:04:04.560]   You were editor in chief at the time of Windows Magazine, I think.
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:05.560]   Is that right?
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:06.560]   PC computing?
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:10.880]   I get that one wrong too, every time.
[00:04:10.880 --> 00:04:13.160]   I'm going to put this third eye back on my head.
[00:04:13.160 --> 00:04:14.160]   Maybe it'll help me get it right.
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:16.840]   I don't know.
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.120]   So we were talking before the show about Dogecoin.
[00:04:21.120 --> 00:04:23.600]   We all thank you for bringing it up.
[00:04:23.600 --> 00:04:25.280]   This makes me so happy.
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:26.440]   Everybody knows about Bitcoin.
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:32.640]   The cryptocurrency invented by a person or a person's unknown using the pseudonym Satoshi
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:33.640]   Nakamoto.
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:35.720]   He's disappeared, but Bitcoin lives on.
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.920]   And obviously, people pay a lot of attention to it.
[00:04:38.920 --> 00:04:46.040]   You can buy in San Francisco, you can buy cupcakes with Bitcoin and drugs with Bitcoin.
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:48.800]   But Bitcoin is not the only cryptocurrency.
[00:04:48.800 --> 00:04:50.600]   There quite a few.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:54.840]   Litecoin is another well-known, well-respected one.
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:58.720]   But there is a, and I don't even know if I should call it a joke cryptocurrency that's
[00:04:58.720 --> 00:05:01.520]   become very popular called Dogecoin.
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:06.000]   It is a play off of an internet meme.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:06.920]   There's the cat, right?
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:10.240]   The eye can has cheeseburger cat.
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:13.400]   And Doge is like the dog response.
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.400]   Is that right, Patrick?
[00:05:14.400 --> 00:05:15.840]   The dog response to the cat?
[00:05:15.840 --> 00:05:17.320]   Well, not exactly.
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.440]   It's not really the response.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:26.880]   It's just a funny looking dog with some similarly weird grammar and spelling.
[00:05:26.880 --> 00:05:29.000]   But it's, yeah, it's very funny.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.080]   It's very quirky.
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.040]   And it lives mostly on things like 4chan and Reddit.
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:36.240]   Of course it does.
[00:05:36.240 --> 00:05:39.280]   Yeah, well, obviously.
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:42.840]   And that's where this Dogecoin thing is taking off.
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:46.640]   It started off as a joke apparently.
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:51.760]   And I think the reason why it's, well, obviously the reason why it's popular is the only difference
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:59.680]   between Dogecoin and other cryptocurrencies like Litecoin and things like that is that.
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:00.680]   It's the meme.
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:05.040]   It's bathed in that stupid, silly humor.
[00:06:05.040 --> 00:06:07.360]   And I think we were talking about before the show.
[00:06:07.360 --> 00:06:13.480]   It's now the seventh most popular cryptocurrency, which doesn't mean it's actually going anywhere.
[00:06:13.480 --> 00:06:14.480]   It's based on Litecoin.
[00:06:14.480 --> 00:06:17.760]   It's using the same technology as Litecoin.
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:23.000]   And according to somebody in the chatroom, it's now trading at roughly 10,000 Dogecoins
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.920]   to the dollar.
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:31.760]   However, I've just learned that many of the people here at our office are mining Dogecoin.
[00:06:31.760 --> 00:06:36.640]   Like the encoding servers we use to take these shows and encode them in all the different
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:37.640]   formats.
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:39.120]   It's not working all the time.
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:42.080]   So when it's not working, it's making Dogecoin.
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.360]   Is that, am I saying it right, by the way, is it?
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:45.520]   I think it's Doge.
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:46.920]   If you go to Know Your Meme.
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:51.560]   That's what Wikipedia, that's how they listed also.
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:57.240]   I mean, Know Your Meme says it's part of a series on interior monologue captioning.
[00:06:57.240 --> 00:07:01.440]   That's the meme type interior monologue captioning.
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.920]   As in, I Can Ask Cheeseburger, first posted five months ago on Know Your Meme.
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:07.920]   So it's about--
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:09.720]   It's a little bit-- yeah, it's a bit older.
[00:07:09.720 --> 00:07:13.520]   The meme itself is a little bit older than that, but it became very popular over the
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.480]   summer, I think.
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:24.320]   And it uses things like the kind of things that the Doge, the dog, says are much something
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:26.800]   or while something or many something.
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:27.800]   In the software.
[00:07:27.800 --> 00:07:33.080]   The wallet that you're using is in Comic Sans Doge's favorite font.
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.160]   And it uses Doge Speak.
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:43.000]   So it says, for the menu, I mean, the label for the menu where you see your wallets, it
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.240]   says much receive.
[00:07:45.240 --> 00:07:51.480]   The history, the tracking of your exchanges, it says, "Many history, your addresses are
[00:07:51.480 --> 00:07:53.280]   very address."
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:07:56.600]   And mining is called Dig with a little paw from Doge.
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:08:05.520]   But there is a kind of a tech angle here, a serious rather tech angle, which is--
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:08.680]   cryptocurrencies are super popular right now.
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:11.760]   And they're one of the very, very hot things.
[00:08:11.760 --> 00:08:18.280]   And it must be both infuriating and frustrating to all the people who are betting on these
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:23.400]   kinds of things and investing so much money in them right now to see that something like
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:26.920]   this can rise to the seventh place.
[00:08:26.920 --> 00:08:31.840]   Again, seventh place doesn't mean a lot because none of those are worth a lot except for maybe
[00:08:31.840 --> 00:08:33.440]   two or three.
[00:08:33.440 --> 00:08:39.920]   But just because Reddit and 4chan and whoever else has taken a like into it.
[00:08:39.920 --> 00:08:44.720]   Well, but it also underscores the-- you're about to say this, so I won't say it.
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.960]   The absurdity of currency in general.
[00:08:46.960 --> 00:08:52.880]   Yeah, I guess that's not exactly what I was about to say, but it's true as well.
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:09:00.640]   Well, but we all pretend that the US dollar, for instance, has some intrinsic value.
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:03.200]   It's a piece of paper, has no intrinsic value.
[00:09:03.200 --> 00:09:05.840]   And then people say, "Well, it would have worked tied to gold," except the gold has
[00:09:05.840 --> 00:09:08.280]   very little intrinsic value.
[00:09:08.280 --> 00:09:13.160]   The value of gold based on its industrial value is much less than the thousands of dollars
[00:09:13.160 --> 00:09:14.160]   in ounce.
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:15.160]   Well, I mean, there's some--
[00:09:15.160 --> 00:09:16.160]   It's all laid up.
[00:09:16.160 --> 00:09:22.160]   Yeah, I mean, it's the value of the trust you put in the government's economy, isn't
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:23.160]   it?
[00:09:23.160 --> 00:09:25.040]   So it does have value.
[00:09:25.040 --> 00:09:29.880]   If we were still tied-- if the dollar was still tied to gold, there have been some really
[00:09:29.880 --> 00:09:38.360]   interesting analysis that have been done of how much gold has fluctuated much more than
[00:09:38.360 --> 00:09:42.240]   the dollar has even just over the past decade.
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:45.120]   It would be very volatile right now, in other words.
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:46.680]   It'd be very, very volatile, yes.
[00:09:46.680 --> 00:09:48.560]   It was good that they untied it.
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:49.560]   Exactly.
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:51.000]   A dollar has been much, much more stable.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:55.200]   Now, I guess you could argue that if they were still tied, maybe that would have stabilized
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:09:56.200]   gold.
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:57.200]   I don't know.
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:59.480]   But it's the tail wagging the dog, right?
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:01.520]   Or in this case, the doge.
[00:10:01.520 --> 00:10:02.520]   There you go.
[00:10:02.520 --> 00:10:07.560]   But I think that's what's interesting because-- so Bitcoin, in a way, kind of underscores
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:12.680]   that we call fiat currency, currency that is based on trust, on full faith and credit
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:15.120]   of the United States government.
[00:10:15.120 --> 00:10:21.240]   So Bitcoin has no-- is also fiat currency in the sense that it's imagined that it's
[00:10:21.240 --> 00:10:22.520]   worth something.
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:25.040]   But then dogecoin, to me, underscores the absurdity of all this.
[00:10:25.040 --> 00:10:30.440]   But it also points out something that I think is a little bit seedier, which is that at
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:35.520]   least to some people-- and I'll include myself-- Bitcoin looks like a very clever pyramid
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:37.160]   scheme.
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:42.440]   It is guessed that the earliest Bitcoin creators, including Nakamoto-- Nakamoto is probably a
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:47.840]   Bitcoin billionaire right now, where he had to convert his Bitcoins into dollars.
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:53.040]   And that the people who start these currencies are, in fact, potentially profiting greatly
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:55.640]   from all of this attention and speculation.
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:56.640]   Yeah.
[00:10:56.640 --> 00:10:57.640]   Sorry.
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:02.480]   What I don't understand, Leo-- and I know you've talked about this number of different
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.680]   shows, so maybe there's consensus on it.
[00:11:04.680 --> 00:11:07.640]   I don't understand why it's spiking.
[00:11:07.640 --> 00:11:11.560]   So you look at what Bitcoin has done just in the past couple quarters.
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:12.560]   It's ridiculous.
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:15.000]   Yeah, it's gone back down a little bit.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   It has gone back down.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:17.600]   It has gone back down.
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:18.600]   Yeah.
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.600]   But--
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:22.200]   Well, that shows me there's a lot of speculation in it, right?
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:23.200]   Yes.
[00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.200]   Yes.
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.200]   Right.
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:26.200]   Yeah.
[00:11:26.200 --> 00:11:30.320]   Well, it's understandable that there's-- we call it speculation.
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:31.800]   There's also potential.
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:35.200]   Speculation is people seeing potential in that currency.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:36.760]   And there is a huge potential there.
[00:11:36.760 --> 00:11:44.000]   I mean, it could-- if it stabilizes at some point, it could become, well, what the promise
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:47.200]   of it is, which is a currency that is not controlled.
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:56.280]   It's kind of what the web and the internet did for communication and for rather media.
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:57.760]   This could do for currency.
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:04.120]   And there is-- I don't think it's only baseless speculation.
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:10.760]   I think there is a possibility somewhere out there that this could become stable in the
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:11.760]   future.
[00:12:11.760 --> 00:12:16.120]   Now, of course, it's only a possibility, but it's understandable that people are betting
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:20.320]   on that possibility because if it was certain, then obviously everyone would be doing it
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:23.120]   and it wouldn't have the value it does.
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:25.280]   The Vinkle Vise.
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:30.640]   The Vinkle Voss twins who have heavily invested in Bitcoin, proving that they, in fact, should
[00:12:30.640 --> 00:12:33.360]   never have had any money from Mark Zuckerberg at all.
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:36.920]   But they say that Bitcoin will reach $40,000 of coin next year.
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:38.320]   Currently, it's about $600.
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:44.200]   It's been as high, I think, as $1,200 on Mt. Gox, which is just one of the-- oh, it looks
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:47.600]   like it got over 1,500 bucks on Mt. Gox a few days ago.
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:48.600]   It's just so bizarre.
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:51.200]   It's almost like people are treating it instead of a currency.
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:55.200]   It's almost like it's been treated like some kind of investment mechanism.
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:56.200]   Yes.
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:57.200]   Right?
[00:12:57.200 --> 00:12:58.800]   It's a pyramid scheme.
[00:12:58.800 --> 00:12:59.800]   It's a scam.
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:01.200]   I don't know what it is.
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:05.760]   I think the Dogecoin is great because it is simultaneously making fun of it and making
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:07.320]   a little money for its inventors.
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:08.320]   Now, Father--
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:13.660]   If you want to, but if you really want to go and figure out what it is, isn't it the
[00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:17.440]   equivalent of a collateralized security?
[00:13:17.440 --> 00:13:22.160]   There's this thing off there that has some value, but really it's being traded as if
[00:13:22.160 --> 00:13:28.400]   it were shares in something the same way that mortgages were packaged into certificates.
[00:13:28.400 --> 00:13:29.400]   Right.
[00:13:29.400 --> 00:13:30.800]   And look how well that worked out for us.
[00:13:30.800 --> 00:13:33.960]   Well, and that was exactly where I was going with that.
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:42.080]   Unfortunately, the way that Bitcoin works, I don't think it can get big enough to avoid
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:47.760]   being manipulated by large numbers of people.
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:48.760]   That's interesting.
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:52.480]   Now, overstock.com announced this week, in fact, I think today that they are going to
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:56.360]   accept Bitcoin for buying stuff at overstock.com.
[00:13:56.360 --> 00:13:59.840]   So you can get real stuff with Bitcoin.
[00:13:59.840 --> 00:14:03.800]   I think you can pay your WordPress.com account in Bitcoin, can't you?
[00:14:03.800 --> 00:14:09.080]   Yeah, there's lots of-- one of our sponsors, ProXBN, which is an open VPN, takes Bitcoin.
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:13.000]   As I said, there's a cupcake shop in San Francisco that takes Bitcoin.
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:14.680]   So what does that buy you?
[00:14:14.680 --> 00:14:16.400]   500 cupcakes for one Bitcoin?
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:21.520]   Well, there's the irony of it is, remember that early on, somebody bought a pizza, he
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.000]   used thousands of Bitcoins.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:25.120]   It's like a multi-million dollar pizza.
[00:14:25.120 --> 00:14:26.120]   Oh my gosh.
[00:14:26.120 --> 00:14:28.880]   Now, had he known, but at the time it wasn't worth much.
[00:14:28.880 --> 00:14:29.880]   Wow.
[00:14:29.880 --> 00:14:32.680]   To me, I think that anybody who takes Bitcoin now, and I include myself because you can
[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:36.920]   donate to us, we take Bitcoin.
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:39.520]   It's purely like, well, what's the risk of this?
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:42.920]   Show us, sell a few-- you're not going to sell a lot of cupcakes on Bitcoin.
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:45.240]   We're overstock's probably not going to sell a lot of stuff.
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:49.800]   But hey, collect those Bitcoins because at some point, there seems some likelihood they
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:54.760]   may be worth hundreds of times more in a year or two, right?
[00:14:54.760 --> 00:14:56.680]   The only thing is, when do you get out?
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:57.680]   Or zero.
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:14:58.680]   Or zero.
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:14:59.680]   Zero.
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:01.920]   So that's the question is, when do you get out?
[00:15:01.920 --> 00:15:02.920]   China is in out--
[00:15:02.920 --> 00:15:06.120]   Getting out last week was probably a good idea.
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:08.680]   And my flus is worth nothing.
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:10.880]   No, I have thousands of flus.
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:11.880]   Flus.
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:16.400]   I remember flus and wuffies and flatter.
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:17.400]   Flatter?
[00:15:17.400 --> 00:15:19.480]   Flatter's still out there.
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:20.480]   That's a--
[00:15:20.480 --> 00:15:21.480]   Flatter, yeah.
[00:15:21.480 --> 00:15:22.480]   Flatter still works.
[00:15:22.480 --> 00:15:26.600]   Flus was the virtual currency from the original.com bubble.
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:30.440]   I think Whoopi Goldberg was the spokesperson for--
[00:15:30.440 --> 00:15:32.440]   FLL-O-O-Z.
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:37.320]   It was promoted by Whoopi Goldberg in 1999.
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.640]   A series of television advertisements.
[00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:44.760]   It was created by I Village founder Robert Levitan in an attempt to establish a currency
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:47.520]   unique to internet merchants.
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:53.080]   It comes-- you know, the problem is it sounds like flus.
[00:15:53.080 --> 00:15:54.920]   It's not a good name.
[00:15:54.920 --> 00:16:00.640]   They were notified by the FBI in 2001 that a Russian organized crime syndicate was using
[00:16:00.640 --> 00:16:06.280]   flus and stolen credit card numbers as part of a money laundering scheme.
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:07.280]   This--
[00:16:07.280 --> 00:16:08.280]   Wow.
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:16.320]   Virtual-- it really is interesting though, virtual currency that it is going mainstream,
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:20.280]   that it is going to much larger attention.
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:21.960]   It's got the attention of the government.
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:27.280]   When we first did tech republic for the first five years, we had what we call tech points,
[00:16:27.280 --> 00:16:29.560]   which was essentially a form of virtual currency.
[00:16:29.560 --> 00:16:36.600]   You got them like every-- the base currency was-- you got for reading an article.
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:40.400]   You got some-- you got a lot more for participating in the forums.
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:47.800]   You got some for basically rating articles if you thumb them up or thumb them down.
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:51.440]   It was really interesting because part of the promise at the beginning was, well eventually
[00:16:51.440 --> 00:16:57.040]   you'll be able to get swag with them or you could turn them in to do-- we're really wrestling
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:16:59.320]   over what should we let people do with them?
[00:16:59.320 --> 00:17:03.440]   Should we let them like not-- could they not see ads for a year or something if they have
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:06.000]   enough points?
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.400]   So we really wrestling with it.
[00:17:07.400 --> 00:17:11.080]   After about five years, we never really decided-- we never figured out the right way to handle
[00:17:11.080 --> 00:17:12.080]   it.
[00:17:12.080 --> 00:17:15.880]   And so at some point, I can't even remember why we kind of just said they're going away.
[00:17:15.880 --> 00:17:18.680]   We converted the flus and it disappeared.
[00:17:18.680 --> 00:17:19.680]   Yeah, we did.
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:24.840]   But man, you should have seen the revolt when we ended-- I mean, we were-- it was one of
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:27.240]   those things that we found out.
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:30.960]   Everybody's kind of forgotten about them by now because they really hadn't been a prominent
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:31.960]   site.
[00:17:31.960 --> 00:17:32.960]   So why are you bringing it up again?
[00:17:32.960 --> 00:17:33.960]   Yeah, I know.
[00:17:33.960 --> 00:17:34.960]   Don't explain everything.
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:35.960]   Don't explain.
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:46.600]   I don't think the world was really ready for virtual currency was part of it.
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:47.600]   We weren't the only ones.
[00:17:47.600 --> 00:17:50.880]   Sites were doing this kind of thing.
[00:17:50.880 --> 00:17:56.440]   But now it does seem at least, despite all of the crazy inflationary activity going on
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:18:02.640]   with Bitcoin and everything, there's an appetite, obviously, for digital currency.
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:08.880]   And it's hard to think that it will be Bitcoin with everything that's going on with Bitcoin.
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:11.440]   But at some point, this is going to happen.
[00:18:11.440 --> 00:18:15.400]   And this is probably going to happen a lot sooner than we anticipated.
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:18.480]   And suddenly, one of the big stories of 2013--
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:23.880]   We can't stop talking about it, but it's hard for me to assess what it means.
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:27.760]   I don't know if it's important, if it's not important, if it's a scam, if it's the next
[00:18:27.760 --> 00:18:28.760]   big thing.
[00:18:28.760 --> 00:18:32.200]   It's very-- and Dogecoin, I love it because they made a joke out of it.
[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:33.720]   And yet, we're mining Dogecoin.
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:37.480]   In fact, Father Robert Ballis, or one of our hosts he hosts NoHow in this weekend Enterprise
[00:18:37.480 --> 00:18:40.600]   Tech, is going-- he says Dogecoin is actually kind of interesting.
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:47.560]   It's based on Litecoin's proof of work, reverse hash designed, not to kind of resist what's
[00:18:47.560 --> 00:18:48.560]   happening with Bitcoin.
[00:18:48.560 --> 00:18:53.600]   You know, with Bitcoin now, the way Bitcoin was set up is that as more and more processors
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:57.160]   are doing the work, it becomes harder and harder to solve.
[00:18:57.160 --> 00:18:59.960]   The problems get harder so that it evens out.
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:02.720]   So it makes it hard to mine.
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:08.680]   And apparently, this is exactly what Dogecoin and Litecoin are avoiding.
[00:19:08.680 --> 00:19:13.680]   It's more resistant to the idea of throwing a lot of power on it because it needs a lot
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:21.040]   of memory, which he says Robert is a priest so you can listen to him, makes it more for
[00:19:21.040 --> 00:19:22.200]   the common man.
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:27.880]   So in two weeks, we're going to do an issue of NoHow in which Robert will assemble a reasonably
[00:19:27.880 --> 00:19:34.600]   expensive-- inexpensive, I think he means, mining rig based on an AMD GPU that should
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:38.600]   be good for about 12,000 Doge a day.
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:39.600]   So watch in two weeks.
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:42.440]   You too, because that's Doge mining.
[00:19:42.440 --> 00:19:43.880]   That's about a buck 20, right?
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:44.880]   Yeah, buck 20.
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.680]   Yeah, pretty much.
[00:19:46.680 --> 00:19:48.320]   Wait, yeah, 12,000.
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:49.320]   So yeah, buck 20.
[00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:50.320]   No, you nailed it.
[00:19:50.320 --> 00:19:51.720]   Buck 20 a day.
[00:19:51.720 --> 00:19:56.320]   Now see, to me, I'm much more interested in gems because I'm playing Clash of Clans.
[00:19:56.320 --> 00:19:57.760]   It used to be donuts.
[00:19:57.760 --> 00:20:01.560]   I should not laugh at people because Linden dollars, donuts, whatever.
[00:20:01.560 --> 00:20:07.640]   I spent some serious money on the Simpsons tapped out at the New York Times yesterday
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:14.480]   had a story about George Yao, who was the-- he they call him master of his virtual domain.
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:18.380]   He was the king of Clash of Clans players.
[00:20:18.380 --> 00:20:26.280]   This is a game that is now netting the Finnish company Supercell as much as $2.4 million
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:28.040]   a day.
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:34.240]   $2.4 million a day, people are buying gems to play this game.
[00:20:34.240 --> 00:20:35.240]   Now it's actually a good game.
[00:20:35.240 --> 00:20:36.240]   There's some strategy involved.
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:37.560]   It's a fun game to play.
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:44.880]   The Rothbank just took a 51% stake in Supercell for $1.5 billion.
[00:20:44.880 --> 00:20:51.080]   There's money in them that are fake currencies.
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:53.480]   I've only spent $20 in Clash of Clans, and that's it.
[00:20:53.480 --> 00:20:55.040]   I'm not going to spend any more.
[00:20:55.040 --> 00:20:58.000]   I've learned my lesson.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:20:59.160]   It's a Skinner box.
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.360]   Somebody said Paula Deen says, "Hi Paula.
[00:21:01.360 --> 00:21:02.360]   Hey, love you.
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:03.360]   Love you, show.
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:04.560]   Paula Deen says it's a Skinner box.
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:05.560]   It's true.
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:10.280]   All of the design video games today are not fun.
[00:21:10.280 --> 00:21:13.040]   They're compulsive.
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:15.320]   You have to play.
[00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:17.080]   Are you harvesting right now, Lisa?
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:20.200]   Are you doing presents and tapped out?
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:24.760]   She's already done it today.
[00:21:24.760 --> 00:21:27.760]   Any of you guys play any of these games?
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:28.760]   No.
[00:21:28.760 --> 00:21:29.760]   No.
[00:21:29.760 --> 00:21:30.760]   No.
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:31.760]   Zingka doesn't have a hook in your round thread bot.
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:34.760]   Is that because you're older and wiser?
[00:21:34.760 --> 00:21:35.760]   Too busy.
[00:21:35.760 --> 00:21:38.520]   You've got a life.
[00:21:38.520 --> 00:21:41.160]   They don't pay me for that.
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:46.880]   I think I have to say we are distracted to death at this point.
[00:21:46.880 --> 00:21:48.760]   I obviously play.
[00:21:48.760 --> 00:21:49.760]   I'm a gamer.
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:56.240]   I play a lot of games, but unfortunately I have to refrain from commenting on any gaming
[00:21:56.240 --> 00:21:58.200]   story because I work in the gaming industry.
[00:21:58.200 --> 00:21:59.760]   What do you do?
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:01.360]   I work at Blizzard.
[00:22:01.360 --> 00:22:03.360]   Oh, I love Blizzard.
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:04.360]   Yeah.
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:05.360]   I do.
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:06.360]   So, Blizzard's awesome.
[00:22:06.360 --> 00:22:14.280]   There's nothing wrong with World of Warcraft that a 60 level mage can't cure.
[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:15.280]   Our show today brought to you.
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:16.280]   We'll talk some more.
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:20.280]   I think gaming is fascinating, but I do think that, you know, see, you're working for an
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:22.720]   old school gaming company.
[00:22:22.720 --> 00:22:27.160]   Although you wouldn't have said an MMORPG was old school a few years ago, but it is.
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:28.160]   Yeah.
[00:22:28.160 --> 00:22:29.160]   Right?
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:30.160]   $40 a month or whatever.
[00:22:30.160 --> 00:22:32.840]   Hey, by the way, does Blizzard still charge for World of Warcraft?
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:33.840]   Of course.
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:34.840]   Yeah.
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:37.920]   Because I thought there might be a trend away from that.
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:45.560]   Well, I don't know about that, but we did announce and started the beta for a virtual
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:49.760]   card game called Hearthstone, which is going really well.
[00:22:49.760 --> 00:22:50.760]   I can't wait to play.
[00:22:50.760 --> 00:22:53.000]   Can you get me in that Hearthstone?
[00:22:53.000 --> 00:22:55.320]   I promised to buy lots of virtual currency.
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:58.000]   Yeah, Blizzard has virtual currency, right?
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   That's right.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:02.840]   Gold mining in World of Warcraft is a big box for a lot of Chinese kids, right?
[00:23:02.840 --> 00:23:03.840]   Yeah.
[00:23:03.840 --> 00:23:04.840]   Yeah.
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:06.440]   But I love Starcraft as a classic.
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:07.760]   I love Diablo.
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:09.320]   Great game.
[00:23:09.320 --> 00:23:10.600]   World of Warcraft played for a while.
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:13.600]   Then I realized it's mostly like run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run,
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:16.000]   run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run,
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:17.760]   run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run,
[00:23:17.760 --> 00:23:18.760]   run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run,
[00:23:18.760 --> 00:23:19.760]   run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run,
[00:23:19.760 --> 00:23:26.760]   run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run,
[00:23:26.760 --> 00:23:29.760]   run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run,
[00:23:29.760 --> 00:23:34.760]   run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run,
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:39.760]   run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run,
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:44.760]   run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run,
[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:48.760]   run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run,

[00:43:16.760 --> 00:43:21.760]   personal capital.com/twit, we thank you for your support.
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:25.760]   You're watching Twit this week in tech last episode of 2013,
[00:43:25.760 --> 00:43:27.760]   biggest story of the year, Ed Bot.
[00:43:27.760 --> 00:43:30.760]   I know that you got the most clicks on the Oracle Crapware story,
[00:43:30.760 --> 00:43:33.760]   and rightly so, it was a mind bender,
[00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:36.760]   but the biggest story has to be the NSA.
[00:43:36.760 --> 00:43:41.760]   The NSA story was also on my list of the top five stories of the year.
[00:43:41.760 --> 00:43:44.760]   I thought what was interesting is, I mean, there's no question
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:49.760]   that the whole, that the Snowden revelations are important and big.
[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:54.760]   What I thought, the story that I wrote way back in early July,
[00:43:54.760 --> 00:43:57.760]   I think, early June, when this first started happening,
[00:43:57.760 --> 00:43:59.760]   it sort of bookmarked the year for me.
[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:06.760]   I wrote a story about how terrible that first story on the NSA leaks was.
[00:44:06.760 --> 00:44:09.760]   It was the one about PRISM, and it was the one that said that the NSA
[00:44:09.760 --> 00:44:13.760]   had direct access to all of these things, and the Washington Post actually
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:16.760]   said that all of these tech companies, Google, Apple, Microsoft,
[00:44:16.760 --> 00:44:20.760]   Yahoo, were knowingly participating with the NSA in this.
[00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:25.760]   And we now know, of course, that they were as much victims as everyone else.
[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:26.760]   They're hopping mad.
[00:44:26.760 --> 00:44:29.760]   They admit with President Obama last week to yell at him.
[00:44:29.760 --> 00:44:34.760]   Yeah, so I think it started with, there's been a lot of sloppy journalism,
[00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:38.760]   and so it's sort of fitting that the year ended with 60 minutes doing one
[00:44:38.760 --> 00:44:42.760]   of the sloppiest, most horrible pieces of journalism.
[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:47.760]   Jason and I both work for sites that are owned by CBS Interactive.
[00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:51.760]   Both disclosure, 60 minutes is part of the parent corporation
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:55.760]   that pays me most of my income during the year, but that was just a terrible story.
[00:44:55.760 --> 00:45:02.760]   There's been a lot of sloppy journalism around the whole NSA story this year, unfortunately.
[00:45:02.760 --> 00:45:09.760]   You actually say the story is not the NSA, the story is the NSA in bad journalism.
[00:45:09.760 --> 00:45:11.760]   Yeah, I think it's back then.
[00:45:11.760 --> 00:45:12.760]   I think it's the story.
[00:45:12.760 --> 00:45:20.760]   I think the story is Snowden himself and going out on a limb and doing what he did.
[00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:26.760]   Interestingly enough, it's come out that he was able to do all of this.
[00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:29.760]   There's a bit of an IT story in this as well.
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:34.760]   He's able to do all of this because it's sort of bad configuration inside the NSA.
[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:39.760]   There was a SharePoint server, and he was able to use that to get all these documents
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:40.760]   that he shouldn't have had access.
[00:45:40.760 --> 00:45:41.760]   I didn't know this.
[00:45:41.760 --> 00:45:42.760]   Wait a minute.
[00:45:42.760 --> 00:45:43.760]   This is interesting.
[00:45:43.760 --> 00:45:50.760]   So, Microsoft SharePoint, which is designed really as a way to share documents among coworkers,
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:52.760]   was it security and misconfigured?
[00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:53.760]   Is that why he was able to get in?
[00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:55.760]   That's my understanding.
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:59.760]   This is a story that just came out this week in terms of how I got there.
[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:02.760]   It's not really a slight refinement of that.
[00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:06.760]   He was set up as a global administrator of it, is my understanding.
[00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:07.760]   That's true.
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:08.760]   Actually, that's right.
[00:46:08.760 --> 00:46:12.760]   They've given him access, but they should never have given him that kind of access as well.
[00:46:12.760 --> 00:46:18.760]   Yes, they've basically, instead of giving him a key to the file cabinet, they gave him
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:20.760]   the master key to every door in the building.
[00:46:20.760 --> 00:46:21.760]   And he wasn't even an employee.
[00:46:21.760 --> 00:46:23.760]   He was a contractor.
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:28.760]   Well, yeah, but that's the other part of this story this year.
[00:46:28.760 --> 00:46:35.760]   Really, to me, the far more important part of this is that we have outsourced so much of
[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:43.760]   the United States government, military establishment, and spying in general to contractors.
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:47.760]   Yeah, and the NSA is primarily contractors.
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:49.760]   It's a lot of contractors that run the NSA.
[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:51.760]   I loved in the 60-minute story.
[00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:55.760]   We bring in high schoolers to do cryptanalysis.
[00:46:55.760 --> 00:46:58.760]   What the hell was the point of that?
[00:46:58.760 --> 00:47:02.760]   Can I just, I'm just curious what the, because the whole thing was obviously carefully crafted
[00:47:02.760 --> 00:47:06.760]   by the NSA to paint a certain picture.
[00:47:06.760 --> 00:47:08.760]   Why do they mention the high schoolers?
[00:47:08.760 --> 00:47:11.760]   Because the young people today should be working for the NSA.
[00:47:11.760 --> 00:47:13.760]   I don't understand that one.
[00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:16.760]   Maybe everybody assumes they're the smartest one.
[00:47:16.760 --> 00:47:17.760]   That's kind of what they said.
[00:47:17.760 --> 00:47:24.760]   I think what they were trying to say was that they were open to the young people.
[00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:26.760]   We love the young people.
[00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:28.760]   They're the future.
[00:47:28.760 --> 00:47:29.760]   Yeah.
[00:47:29.760 --> 00:47:30.760]   Yeah.
[00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:36.760]   Can I just get back to the sloppy journalism part for one quick second?
[00:47:36.760 --> 00:47:43.760]   Just to remind the fact that when the story first broke, we didn't know everything we know now.
[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:51.760]   And Ed, when you're saying that people said, I guess it's Green World, said that Microsoft
[00:47:51.760 --> 00:47:58.760]   and Google and everyone was participating willingly, maybe not willingly, but we're giving away our information.
[00:47:58.760 --> 00:48:00.760]   That's what we believed at the time.
[00:48:00.760 --> 00:48:07.760]   And it took a lot of analysis and thinking and brain-wracking to figure out what prism actually was.
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:11.760]   And I guess it was --
[00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:13.760]   Sorry.
[00:48:13.760 --> 00:48:15.760]   -- on security now.
[00:48:15.760 --> 00:48:16.760]   State Gibson.
[00:48:16.760 --> 00:48:17.760]   State Gibson.
[00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:18.760]   Yeah.
[00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:23.760]   So that's what my takeaway was, which was that this prism slide was the piece of evidence.
[00:48:23.760 --> 00:48:29.760]   What happened was non-technical journalists looked at it and said, oh, Microsoft and Google
[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:31.760]   and Yahoo are cooperating.
[00:48:31.760 --> 00:48:35.760]   It did take Steve Gibson, who sat back and said, no, that's not necessarily what's happening.
[00:48:35.760 --> 00:48:42.760]   I think that they're doing something we now know is the case called up streaming, which was that they were intercepting --
[00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:50.760]   they did not -- although it was unclear, because it did sound like from the slide there that there was an NSA presence within the servers of these companies.
[00:48:50.760 --> 00:48:51.760]   Exactly.
[00:48:51.760 --> 00:49:01.760]   It did take a lot of people thinking about this for, you know, it was a few days, maybe even a couple of weeks, before we finally figured out what it probably was.
[00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:02.760]   Right.
[00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:07.760]   So I think it's a little bit unfair to say that the journalism was sloppy at the beginning when --
[00:49:07.760 --> 00:49:14.760]   Patrick, I think you need to read what I wrote there, because I think you're misinterpreting it based on, you know, 140 character summary.
[00:49:14.760 --> 00:49:15.760]   That's what --
[00:49:15.760 --> 00:49:16.760]   Sorry.
[00:49:16.760 --> 00:49:17.760]   But the story --
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:18.760]   Sorry.
[00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:20.760]   But the story -- there's two things about the story.
[00:49:20.760 --> 00:49:36.760]   Number one, the Washington Post and the Guardian were in competition to break the story, and so they both wound up running it before they had done what a journalist is supposed to do, which was to figure out stuff like that.
[00:49:36.760 --> 00:49:37.760]   Right.
[00:49:37.760 --> 00:49:48.760]   Two, they said things as though they were fact when they didn't have the documentation to support them as fact, or even, frankly, as speculation.
[00:49:48.760 --> 00:50:00.760]   And three, one thing that the Washington Post did was they printed one story that was picked up by literally thousands of other journalistic outlets and sent all over the world.
[00:50:00.760 --> 00:50:11.760]   And then they rewrote the story so that by the next day, the thing that they had online did not even resemble the thing that they published originally that everyone picked up.
[00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:15.760]   Those, I think, are pretty cardinal sins of journalism.
[00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:20.760]   Modern journalism, though, seems to be, get the story out and then fix it over time.
[00:50:20.760 --> 00:50:22.760]   Doesn't that seem to be the way it's all done?
[00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:23.760]   Process journalism.
[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:29.760]   I know this is a tech show, not a journalism show, but, you know, a lot of it is the downward pressure on journalism.
[00:50:29.760 --> 00:50:33.760]   I mean, journalists -- journalists' organizations are thinner than ever.
[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:34.760]   We have fewer fact checkers.
[00:50:34.760 --> 00:50:35.760]   We have fewer copy editors.
[00:50:35.760 --> 00:50:41.760]   We have fewer, you know, what we used to call review editors that are doing this kind of thing.
[00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:45.760]   You know, the news cycle is much shorter.
[00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:48.760]   News cycle used to be about three days, you know, and now it's about three hours.
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:49.760]   So it's tough.
[00:50:49.760 --> 00:50:52.760]   I'm not defending journalists because Ed's exactly right.
[00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:53.760]   Journalists dropped the ball.
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:50:57.760]   I mean, I agree on a lot of this stuff at the beginning.
[00:50:57.760 --> 00:50:59.760]   And we don't know what we know now.
[00:50:59.760 --> 00:51:05.760]   And hindsight is 2020, but clearly people didn't corroborate facts.
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:08.760]   They made leaps that they shouldn't have.
[00:51:08.760 --> 00:51:11.760]   And, you know, this story has kind of been botched all year long.
[00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:13.760]   I mean, really again and again and again.
[00:51:13.760 --> 00:51:23.760]   You know, I'm proud of the fact that thanks to Steve Gibson, our coverage of this has been the most accurate and has proven to be the most accurate from almost from day one.
[00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:31.760]   And it's one of the things that we're starting to -- I've decided to really beef up our news coverage because I feel that somebody's got to do a better job of tech news coverage.
[00:51:31.760 --> 00:51:32.760]   I agree.
[00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:33.760]   It's true.
[00:51:33.760 --> 00:51:37.760]   We have actually purposely -- on tech or public, we've purposely not covered it many times because we've had a lot of time.
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:40.760]   There was so much crap being said both ways.
[00:51:40.760 --> 00:51:43.760]   You know, you try to verify it and you get stonewalled.
[00:51:43.760 --> 00:51:47.760]   We actually haven't published much about it for that reason.
[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:50.760]   And that's not really the answer either, honestly.
[00:51:50.760 --> 00:51:54.760]   And we're trying to figure out what -- we're hiring people.
[00:51:54.760 --> 00:51:56.760]   We're trying to do a better job.
[00:51:56.760 --> 00:51:59.760]   I feel like we need to step up and try it.
[00:51:59.760 --> 00:52:00.760]   We are too.
[00:52:00.760 --> 00:52:02.760]   We're really working on doing better.
[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:04.760]   I think we're going to do a better job.
[00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:07.760]   We're going to do a better job.
[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:11.760]   I think -- okay, I'm the only one who's not an actual journalist here.
[00:52:11.760 --> 00:52:18.760]   So I'm sorry if I'm being -- you know, I think you're being a little bit harsh at the very beginning of these stories.
[00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:21.760]   Could they even -- and maybe I don't know.
[00:52:21.760 --> 00:52:23.760]   But could they even have verified all of this?
[00:52:23.760 --> 00:52:33.760]   Were there ways to actually -- I mean, this is very, very serious and complicated and secret
[00:52:33.760 --> 00:52:35.760]   and dangerous stuff, quite frankly.
[00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:42.760]   I mean, Snowden had the story not been leaked would probably have ended up in a ditch.
[00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:44.760]   I don't -- I'm not saying you're wrong.
[00:52:44.760 --> 00:52:53.760]   Obviously, I have no business saying this, but I'm just -- I just think the way you're presenting this is a little bit harsh.
[00:52:53.760 --> 00:52:57.760]   Well, again, I think maybe you should read what I wrote because I don't think it's harsh.
[00:52:57.760 --> 00:52:59.760]   I think it's accurate.
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:03.760]   But the -- I think there's a debate that needs to happen in this country.
[00:53:03.760 --> 00:53:14.760]   I mean, I was furious about the Patriot Act when it was introduced in 2001 and 2002 and rushed into law.
[00:53:14.760 --> 00:53:20.760]   And I wrote stuff about this in 2004 and 2005.
[00:53:20.760 --> 00:53:33.760]   To me, a lot of what has come out about the NSA is simply saying -- it's simply the details that they were doing exactly what they thought -- what we thought they were doing.
[00:53:33.760 --> 00:53:46.760]   What I'd like to see us have now is a really robust national debate, especially with the legislators who have been falling down on the job of overseeing this kind of surveillance.
[00:53:46.760 --> 00:53:54.760]   And the only way that you can have that debate is by putting accurate information in front of the people.
[00:53:54.760 --> 00:54:06.760]   Now, Glenn Greenwald and Bart Gilman and Laura Poitres and all the people who've been involved in this have been publishing lots of facts and things that the American people deserve to see.
[00:54:06.760 --> 00:54:08.760]   And I have no problem with that.
[00:54:08.760 --> 00:54:18.760]   The problem that I have is on the frequent occasions when they have jumped to conclusions that weren't justified by the things that they were printing.
[00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:33.760]   And as a result, people who only read a fraction of the news reports anyway come into the debate with a set of beliefs that aren't supported by the facts.
[00:54:33.760 --> 00:54:43.760]   And that, to me, is an overreach. And a lot of the overreach becomes because the people who are writing this are also trying to be advocates.
[00:54:43.760 --> 00:54:51.760]   And when you're an advocate, sometimes you start editorializing beyond where the facts take you.
[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:58.760]   And it's the world of journalism has changed to that -- it has become that, advocacy journalism.
[00:54:58.760 --> 00:55:04.760]   It's an interesting issue. We're going to move on. The other stories that you highlighted, it's very interesting.
[00:55:04.760 --> 00:55:13.760]   And somebody who covers Microsoft, this was a year for Microsoft News, like crazy Microsoft News.
[00:55:13.760 --> 00:55:24.760]   Starting with Windows 8, 8.1, Balmer Quitting, the search for CEO, the Surface Microsoft getting into hardware for the first time ever.
[00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:29.760]   I mean, I just go on and on and on. It was an amazing year of change at Microsoft.
[00:55:29.760 --> 00:55:41.760]   >> On the Office 365 as a subscription service for what had been a conventional piece of software, one of the single most popular pieces of software in the world is now a subscription service.
[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:48.760]   >> Yep. Something Microsoft wanted to do for years, but finally did. And it probably means Windows will be next.
[00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:54.760]   >> And the Xbox One, the PlayStation 4, I guess, but the Xbox One is a big one for Microsoft, too.
[00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:57.760]   Who's going to be the next CEO of Microsoft, Ed Bot?
[00:55:57.760 --> 00:56:00.760]   >> You know, I know you know.
[00:56:00.760 --> 00:56:16.760]   >> I don't. I mean, if I had to guess, I would say that, you know, I think the two frontrunners right now are Alan Malali from Ford and Satya Nadella, Satya Nadella, who's the internal candidate.
[00:56:16.760 --> 00:56:31.760]   If I had to guess, I think that it's going to be a very typical Microsoft solution where Malali will become the CEO and Satya will be the CTO in a role that Microsoft hasn't had a CTO since Ray Aussie left.
[00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:41.760]   And so this will allow them to have the technical leadership without Satya having to take all the bullets that would come with also being CEO.
[00:56:41.760 --> 00:56:42.760]   That's my guess.
[00:56:42.760 --> 00:56:44.760]   >> Is Microsoft manageable, though?
[00:56:44.760 --> 00:56:45.760]   >> Sure it is.
[00:56:45.760 --> 00:56:46.760]   >> Is it?
[00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:48.760]   >> It's fact it's fact it's being very well managed.
[00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:49.760]   >> Such a hairball.
[00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:50.760]   >> From a business point of view.
[00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:52.760]   >> There's so many divisions.
[00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:53.760]   >> Yeah.
[00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:54.760]   >> Yeah.
[00:56:54.760 --> 00:56:58.760]   >> And right now divisions fighting with each other, although that seems to...
[00:56:58.760 --> 00:56:59.760]   >> That's always been the case.
[00:56:59.760 --> 00:57:00.760]   >> Right.
[00:57:00.760 --> 00:57:02.760]   >> But makes it hard to manage.
[00:57:02.760 --> 00:57:03.760]   >> Yep.
[00:57:03.760 --> 00:57:10.760]   That's kind of what the whole one Microsoft thing is about.
[00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:12.760]   >> Devices and services company.
[00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:15.760]   >> Well, yeah.
[00:57:15.760 --> 00:57:20.760]   But it's, I mean, technology industry today as we were talking about is a devices and services.
[00:57:20.760 --> 00:57:22.760]   >> That's a good point.
[00:57:22.760 --> 00:57:24.760]   That's not such a stretch to say that, is it?
[00:57:24.760 --> 00:57:26.760]   That's what we are all doing.
[00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:33.760]   >> I mean, I think that there may be the fact that it's that we're still waiting on it and that they've kind of pushed it till...
[00:57:33.760 --> 00:57:35.760]   >> They say it won't be until next year now.
[00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:39.760]   >> Early next year, I think makes me think that there's probably some kind of...
[00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:42.760]   there's something going on in the back room that maybe they didn't expect.
[00:57:42.760 --> 00:57:46.760]   I mean, they released all this sort of Balmer stuff in December.
[00:57:46.760 --> 00:57:49.760]   They were teeing this up for it to happen.
[00:57:49.760 --> 00:57:54.760]   >> You think that's why Balmer gave Mary Jo Foley and others exclusive...
[00:57:54.760 --> 00:57:55.760]   >> I don't know.
[00:57:55.760 --> 00:57:56.760]   >> I guess not so exclusive interviews.
[00:57:56.760 --> 00:57:57.760]   Do you think that's why?
[00:57:57.760 --> 00:57:58.760]   >> I don't know.
[00:57:58.760 --> 00:58:01.760]   I don't know, but that's the logical conclusion you would come to, right?
[00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:02.760]   >> Yeah.
[00:58:02.760 --> 00:58:07.760]   >> You know, you do that because you're teeing this up to, you know, to say about him and you sort of...
[00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:12.760]   you do that and you do that for a couple days and then, you know, a couple days later, you announce the new CEO.
[00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:13.760]   >> Right.
[00:58:13.760 --> 00:58:15.760]   >> That's typically the way you would do it.
[00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:21.760]   And, you know, most of the vibe throughout the year was like, this was going to happen by the end of the year.
[00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:25.760]   >> Is this a good time... if you're making an announcement and you want attention, is this a good time?
[00:58:25.760 --> 00:58:26.760]   It seems like not.
[00:58:26.760 --> 00:58:29.760]   >> You don't have much to compete with.
[00:58:29.760 --> 00:58:31.760]   I mean, you could argue it both ways, right?
[00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:32.760]   There's not much to compete with.
[00:58:32.760 --> 00:58:33.760]   >> There's no other news.
[00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:34.760]   >> There's not much news, right?
[00:58:34.760 --> 00:58:37.760]   You're going to get all the spotlight.
[00:58:37.760 --> 00:58:38.760]   Where do the same time people are distracted by?
[00:58:38.760 --> 00:58:39.760]   >> But is anybody paying attention, right?
[00:58:39.760 --> 00:58:40.760]   >> Right.
[00:58:40.760 --> 00:58:41.760]   >> Exactly.
[00:58:41.760 --> 00:58:43.760]   >> You get coverage, but is anybody reading the newspaper?
[00:58:43.760 --> 00:58:44.760]   >> Yeah.
[00:58:44.760 --> 00:58:47.760]   So, you know, you can argue both sides of that.
[00:58:47.760 --> 00:58:52.760]   Beginning of the year is really tough time to announce it.
[00:58:52.760 --> 00:58:54.760]   You know, you compete with CES.
[00:58:54.760 --> 00:58:59.760]   You're also going to have product news that people are revving up to go at the beginning of the year as well.
[00:58:59.760 --> 00:59:03.760]   So, you know, you can argue it both ways.
[00:59:03.760 --> 00:59:07.760]   >> You think the future of Microsoft, and I've said this and written this many times,
[00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:11.760]   I think the future of Microsoft is primarily a cloud company.
[00:59:11.760 --> 00:59:16.760]   I mean, if you look at, there's a lot of things that obviously key mistakes that
[00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:20.760]   Ballmer made, you know, missing the mobile revolution is the big one.
[00:59:20.760 --> 00:59:26.760]   I mean, Microsoft had a huge lead in tablets and smartphones that, you know, he completely, you know, spent.
[00:59:26.760 --> 00:59:27.760]   It's not all his fault.
[00:59:27.760 --> 00:59:32.760]   He's not the one running product for those things, but, you know, you have to take responsibility for it.
[00:59:32.760 --> 00:59:50.760]   But what he did get right and doesn't get as much credit for and should is the fact that he was investing, you know, in enterprise and in cloud in a big way and really turned them into a powerhouse in both of those areas, things that don't get talked about much, but Microsoft still has a lot of trust in enterprise,
[00:59:50.760 --> 00:59:54.760]   despite things like this SharePoint, Crefuffle, with the Snowden thing.
[00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:55.760]   >> Was it Microsoft's fault?
[00:59:55.760 --> 00:59:59.760]   >> It's not really Microsoft's fault if they misconfigured it, right?
[00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:04.760]   And in the cloud, I mean, Azure has a potential to be one of the winners.
[01:00:04.760 --> 01:00:09.760]   What Azure works well with Linux, it works well with other platforms.
[01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:12.760]   You know, it scales in really big ways.
[01:00:12.760 --> 01:00:25.760]   And so, you know, those two things, my sense is five or ten years from now, Microsoft may not be a household brand in the same way, or it may not in the same way it is.
[01:00:25.760 --> 01:00:37.760]   That's kind of up in the air, but I think it's still going to be a powerhouse in the computing world, the same way, kind of Oracle and IBM and other companies are, because they've got a ton of momentum for that behind the scene stuff.
[01:00:37.760 --> 01:00:39.760]   >> You know, there's a big opportunity for them.
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:41.760]   This company, Blackberry, I think it's falling apart.
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:44.760]   Maybe there's opportunity there.
[01:00:44.760 --> 01:00:49.760]   Blackberry announces a $4.4 billion quarterly loss.
[01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:54.760]   You got to be a big company to lose $4.5 billion in three months.
[01:00:54.760 --> 01:00:55.760]   >> Yeah.
[01:00:55.760 --> 01:00:56.760]   Yeah.
[01:00:56.760 --> 01:00:57.760]   >> That's almost.
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:00:58.760]   >> Yeah.
[01:00:58.760 --> 01:01:02.760]   >> Somebody called the radio show today and asked me, "So is it over for Blackberry?
[01:01:02.760 --> 01:01:05.760]   Should I not buy a Blackberry?" And I said, "No, you should not buy a Blackberry."
[01:01:05.760 --> 01:01:08.760]   Is that premature? Is it over for Blackberry?
[01:01:08.760 --> 01:01:11.760]   >> I mean, how many times can we call it?
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:15.760]   >> It's a slow lingering death.
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:20.760]   >> We've been calling it for too long to even imagine.
[01:01:20.760 --> 01:01:21.760]   Yeah.
[01:01:21.760 --> 01:01:23.760]   It's just a flesh wound.
[01:01:23.760 --> 01:01:24.760]   >> Yeah.
[01:01:24.760 --> 01:01:29.760]   >> Well, the Blackberry OS X was their last hurrah.
[01:01:29.760 --> 01:01:33.760]   >> They really, and the Z10 was supposed to be the phone, right?
[01:01:33.760 --> 01:01:35.760]   This is going to save us.
[01:01:35.760 --> 01:01:36.760]   >> Yeah.
[01:01:36.760 --> 01:01:39.760]   If anything was going to save them, that was going to be it.
[01:01:39.760 --> 01:01:44.760]   And obviously, well, maybe it's still too early, but obviously it didn't.
[01:01:44.760 --> 01:01:47.760]   So I don't see how they can come back from it.
[01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:57.760]   And there have been rumors about them making cheap entry-level phones with Foxconn.
[01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:01.760]   I don't see how that will help them all that much.
[01:02:01.760 --> 01:02:09.760]   Microsoft, I mean, Windows Phone is now the third in market share in third place.
[01:02:09.760 --> 01:02:11.760]   I don't see Blackberry coming back from it.
[01:02:11.760 --> 01:02:12.760]   They could.
[01:02:12.760 --> 01:02:16.760]   >> John Chen, the new -- he was interim CEO.
[01:02:16.760 --> 01:02:20.760]   He's now said, "No, I'm the CEO because I think nobody else wanted the job."
[01:02:20.760 --> 01:02:26.760]   Sent an email to Blackberry staffer saying, "You don't relax and enjoy Christmas.
[01:02:26.760 --> 01:02:29.760]   It's going to be a nice Christmas."
[01:02:29.760 --> 01:02:35.760]   He says, "My step one was to have the company financially out of harm's way.
[01:02:35.760 --> 01:02:38.760]   Can't say I've done it today, but we're on a good path."
[01:02:38.760 --> 01:02:40.760]   He says, "2014 will be an investment year.
[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:42.760]   He hopes to be cash flow neutral."
[01:02:42.760 --> 01:02:48.760]   In other words, not emerging money by 2015 and actually profitable in 2016, not sure how
[01:02:48.760 --> 01:02:49.760]   you do that.
[01:02:49.760 --> 01:02:50.760]   It ain't with phones.
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:53.760]   >> They're going to be getting rid of a lot more people.
[01:02:53.760 --> 01:02:56.760]   >> Somebody got rid of a lot.
[01:02:56.760 --> 01:03:01.760]   >> Somebody observed that because Ottawa, the Canadian government, is very reluctant to
[01:03:01.760 --> 01:03:05.760]   let Blackberry be sold to China, which is one out.
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:07.760]   They couldn't find a buyer.
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:14.760]   This Foxconn deal is really a backdoor to a Chinese ownership, that Foxconn will be building,
[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:20.760]   selling, even stocking the phones, presumably sending some money back to Canada.
[01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:24.760]   But it sounds like Foxconn is in effect taking over.
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:28.760]   >> Foxconn is the Samsung I think of five or ten years ago.
[01:03:28.760 --> 01:03:31.760]   Actually, probably a little longer than that.
[01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:34.760]   Remember Samsung used to white box, HTC used to white box.
[01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:37.760]   They used to make a lot of devices for everybody else.
[01:03:37.760 --> 01:03:41.760]   You do that long enough and you get enough experience making devices and you go, "We can
[01:03:41.760 --> 01:03:43.760]   make our own devices.
[01:03:43.760 --> 01:03:45.760]   Let's just do this."
[01:03:45.760 --> 01:03:50.760]   You have to expect that Foxconn at some point is going to try to say, "Let's make our
[01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:51.760]   own brand."
[01:03:51.760 --> 01:03:57.760]   Whether it's Foxconn or they may buy a brand or they may just put it under a different
[01:03:57.760 --> 01:04:02.760]   brand, whatever, at some point they're going to do their own brand.
[01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:05.760]   I would be shocked if they didn't do that.
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:11.760]   >> Or make it a take over manufacturer and sales for BlackBerry.
[01:04:11.760 --> 01:04:13.760]   >> Could be, but it's low margin.
[01:04:13.760 --> 01:04:14.760]   That's just low margin.
[01:04:14.760 --> 01:04:18.760]   Eventually you say, "If we could use it, we'd put it over."
[01:04:18.760 --> 01:04:20.760]   >> Why aren't we making an iPhone?
[01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:21.760]   >> Exactly.
[01:04:21.760 --> 01:04:22.760]   That's where all the high margin.
[01:04:22.760 --> 01:04:23.760]   That's where the big money is.
[01:04:23.760 --> 01:04:26.760]   Eventually, that's what you decide you want to do.
[01:04:26.760 --> 01:04:31.760]   >> We had a chatter who works for the Canadian government today who said, "No,
[01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:34.760]   who said that Canadian, do they call them legislators?
[01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:36.760]   I don't know what they call them.
[01:04:36.760 --> 01:04:42.760]   Lords have been told, have been offered Blackberries for the year, but as a, but they're also
[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:44.760]   going to be offered iPhones.
[01:04:44.760 --> 01:04:45.760]   [laughter]
[01:04:45.760 --> 01:04:47.760]   >> Come spring.
[01:04:47.760 --> 01:04:55.760]   >> So I think, I think Patrick's right that the BlackBerry 10 was their big bet and it
[01:04:55.760 --> 01:05:00.760]   flopped when you read, I read through the reports this week and I think 70 or 80% of
[01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:04.760]   the devices they sold this year were BlackBerry 7.
[01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:05.760]   >> Wow.
[01:05:05.760 --> 01:05:06.760]   >> Yeah.
[01:05:06.760 --> 01:05:12.760]   Some, you know, so they really didn't, their new operating system failed.
[01:05:12.760 --> 01:05:19.760]   But the strength that they have is in enterprise device management and patents.
[01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:23.760]   They have a lot of patents for enterprise management.
[01:05:23.760 --> 01:05:29.760]   So ultimately, they may wind up doing something like Nokia did, which is to say,
[01:05:29.760 --> 01:05:38.280]   we'll sell our hardware division to somebody like Foxconn and we'll become a smaller company
[01:05:38.280 --> 01:05:41.760]   focused on network services.
[01:05:41.760 --> 01:05:46.760]   And they could, with all their expertise and their ability to protect some of that expertise
[01:05:46.760 --> 01:05:51.160]   with patents, they could actually survive in that field.
[01:05:51.160 --> 01:05:56.360]   But as Jason points out correctly, that would be with far fewer people than they have today.
[01:05:56.360 --> 01:06:00.360]   >> The Voreak taught me that lesson because years ago, it's over for IBM, he said,
[01:06:00.360 --> 01:06:03.360]   never going to be over for IBM, they have patents.
[01:06:03.360 --> 01:06:04.360]   And that's it.
[01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:11.360]   >> For like 18 consecutive years, they've filed more patents than anybody else.
[01:06:11.360 --> 01:06:14.360]   It's a remarkably, IBM's a remarkably innovative company.
[01:06:14.360 --> 01:06:18.360]   People do compare lots of companies to IBM and every time they do, I'm like,
[01:06:18.360 --> 01:06:19.360]   well, they're not as innovative as IBM.
[01:06:19.360 --> 01:06:20.360]   >> Isn't that interesting?
[01:06:20.360 --> 01:06:22.360]   You know, actually does research.
[01:06:22.360 --> 01:06:24.360]   >> You don't think of them that way, but of course they do.
[01:06:24.360 --> 01:06:25.360]   Yeah.
[01:06:25.360 --> 01:06:33.360]   >> I hope you're enjoying our end of year episode next week, best of, and then the week following
[01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:35.360]   a brand new year for this week in tech.
[01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:38.360]   I appreciate your being here all through the years.
[01:06:38.360 --> 01:06:43.360]   This is our eighth year of beginning, our ninth year next year doing this.
[01:06:43.360 --> 01:06:46.360]   So we've been doing this almost as long as Ed Bot's been blogging.
[01:06:46.360 --> 01:06:50.360]   >> About the same time.
[01:06:50.360 --> 01:06:51.360]   >> Yeah.
[01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:52.360]   And I still don't wear pants.
[01:06:52.360 --> 01:06:54.360]   >> Here's your tin foil hat.
[01:06:54.360 --> 01:06:55.360]   >> Thank you.
[01:06:55.360 --> 01:06:57.360]   I want the tin.
[01:06:57.360 --> 01:07:03.360]   And we do it thanks to our great sponsors who make this possible, always free because we
[01:07:03.360 --> 01:07:05.360]   are ad supported.
[01:07:05.360 --> 01:07:08.360]   I kind of, you know, made that choice early on with Twit for a while.
[01:07:08.360 --> 01:07:12.360]   We thought maybe we would be a paid service or we'd take donations.
[01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:15.360]   But I think, you know what, Mike Elkins convinced me of this.
[01:07:15.360 --> 01:07:19.360]   He said, the idea of making this free, so it's ultimately democratic.
[01:07:19.360 --> 01:07:22.360]   So everybody gets to watch as many eyeballs as possible.
[01:07:22.360 --> 01:07:28.360]   And then hand picking, great advertisers, just a handful of them to bring them to you.
[01:07:28.360 --> 01:07:30.360]   That seems to work out pretty well.
[01:07:30.360 --> 01:07:32.360]   One of those advertisers has been with us for a long time.
[01:07:32.360 --> 01:07:35.360]   Four years, five years now, Squarespace.com.
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:44.360]   The best hosting plus the best software on top of that to give you a website that is just fantastic.
[01:07:44.360 --> 01:07:50.360]   Never goes down, always beautiful, mobile responsive now with their new designs.
[01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:52.360]   And they have so many great templates.
[01:07:52.360 --> 01:07:56.360]   In fact, if you go to squarespace.com and click Get Started, you get to pick a template.
[01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:58.360]   For two weeks, you can use Squarespace.
[01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:01.360]   At no cost, you don't even have to give them a credit card.
[01:08:01.360 --> 01:08:02.360]   Play with the different templates.
[01:08:02.360 --> 01:08:06.360]   The beauty of this is the way Squarespace is designed.
[01:08:06.360 --> 01:08:08.360]   Your content is completely independent.
[01:08:08.360 --> 01:08:10.360]   This is how it should be of the template.
[01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:13.360]   So you pick a lovely template like the front row, import your content.
[01:08:13.360 --> 01:08:15.360]   And then if you say, hey, do you want to try a different one?
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:19.360]   You just press a button and everything's reflow to fit into the new template.
[01:08:19.360 --> 01:08:27.360]   Every Squarespace site looks different because it's so easy to completely customize it using click and drag and point and click.
[01:08:27.360 --> 01:08:32.360]   If you know JavaScript, they've got a great developers platform, but you don't have to use it.
[01:08:32.360 --> 01:08:37.360]   All of the templates, every one of them, is mobile responsive.
[01:08:37.360 --> 01:08:41.360]   That means the site looks great no matter what size screen.
[01:08:41.360 --> 01:08:48.360]   From iPhone to 32 inch 4K display, your site will resize and reflow to always look at its best.
[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:56.360]   That's nice too because if you're using Squarespace Commerce, it means you've got both mobile and desktop commerce all inclusive.
[01:08:56.360 --> 01:08:57.360]   You've got to try it.
[01:08:57.360 --> 01:08:59.360]   Two weeks free, visit squarespace.com.
[01:08:59.360 --> 01:09:01.360]   If you decide to buy, the pricing is great.
[01:09:01.360 --> 01:09:03.360]   It starts as low as $8 a month.
[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:06.360]   Probably you're going to want to go with the most popular plan.
[01:09:06.360 --> 01:09:09.360]   That's the unlimited plan, $16 a month when you buy the annual plan.
[01:09:09.360 --> 01:09:14.360]   That's unlimited pages, unlimited galleries, unlimited blogs, unlimited bandwidth.
[01:09:14.360 --> 01:09:16.360]   You'll never get a bandwidth bill.
[01:09:16.360 --> 01:09:17.360]   You can be the most popular site on the internet.
[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:20.360]   No problem, no cost, no additional cost.
[01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:27.360]   Unlimited contributors, they have that great developer platform with a color coded syntax editor and all that.
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:28.360]   Custom domain name is free.
[01:09:28.360 --> 01:09:32.360]   They'll hook it all up for you when you buy an annual plan and of course the best support in the business.
[01:09:32.360 --> 01:09:34.360]   They've won this year.
[01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:38.360]   They won a Stevie award for outstanding service of gold and Stevie.
[01:09:38.360 --> 01:09:43.360]   If you want to sell, in case you're not too late, you could probably start as commerce.
[01:09:43.360 --> 01:09:48.360]   You could do it so quickly, you could probably start a e-commerce site today for the holidays.
[01:09:48.360 --> 01:09:52.360]   You'd be like, you'd have to get the word out, $24 a month.
[01:09:52.360 --> 01:09:54.360]   No transaction fees.
[01:09:54.360 --> 01:09:57.360]   If you need to, they'll set you up with a merchant account.
[01:09:57.360 --> 01:09:59.360]   I think they, who's their provider?
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:01.360]   I can't remember the name.
[01:10:01.360 --> 01:10:04.360]   But you do also get unlimited physical, digital and service products.
[01:10:04.360 --> 01:10:08.360]   They will help you with inventory tracking, with tax, shipping calculations.
[01:10:08.360 --> 01:10:09.360]   You can do coupon controls.
[01:10:09.360 --> 01:10:11.360]   It is fabulous.
[01:10:11.360 --> 01:10:14.360]   I've wanted you to visit them.
[01:10:14.360 --> 01:10:15.360]   Squarespace.com.

[01:10:23.360 --> 01:10:24.360]   Twit12.

[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:41.360]   Tom Merritt is here.
[01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:42.360]   But, say go ahead.
[01:10:42.360 --> 01:10:45.360]   Sorry, I was just saying, I found out about Squarespace from Twit.
[01:10:45.360 --> 01:10:46.360]   Thank you.
[01:10:46.360 --> 01:10:48.360]   They've been using it for four or five years.
[01:10:48.360 --> 01:10:56.360]   And, uh, how, I mean, it sort of changed the game for me, having to worry about bandwidth and, um, also, uh, design.
[01:10:56.360 --> 01:10:57.360]   What's your step?
[01:10:57.360 --> 01:10:58.360]   You're not talking about tech or public.
[01:10:58.360 --> 01:10:59.360]   What site is it?
[01:10:59.360 --> 01:11:02.360]   What site are you talking about?
[01:11:02.360 --> 01:11:03.360]   Yeah, sorry.
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:05.360]   My personal site, Jason Heiner.com.
[01:11:05.360 --> 01:11:07.360]   J-A-S-O-N-H-I-N-E-R.com.
[01:11:07.360 --> 01:11:09.360]   I want to check you out on the Squarespace.
[01:11:09.360 --> 01:11:13.360]   Oh, look at that nice, nice boy and a little cap there.
[01:11:13.360 --> 01:11:16.360]   Journalist, editor, world citizen.
[01:11:16.360 --> 01:11:17.360]   I love it.
[01:11:17.360 --> 01:11:18.360]   Um, yeah.
[01:11:18.360 --> 01:11:19.360]   And it never goes down.
[01:11:19.360 --> 01:11:20.360]   You never have to worry about bandwidth.
[01:11:20.360 --> 01:11:22.360]   Thank you for the unsolicited testimonial, Jason Heiner.
[01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:23.360]   I appreciate it.
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:26.360]   I was about to say Tom Merritt is here with a look.
[01:11:26.360 --> 01:11:29.360]   I don't think it's going to be a very busy week, but let's get a look at the week ahead, Tom.
[01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:30.360]   Hey, thanks, Leo.
[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:31.360]   Not much in the week ahead.
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:34.360]   In fact, not much really going to happen until CES.
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:38.360]   But I just want to say on behalf of everybody at Tech News today, Merry Christmas.
[01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:39.360]   Happy holidays.
[01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:40.360]   Happy Festivus.
[01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:41.360]   We'll see you December 30th.
[01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:46.360]   We've got our aluminum pole right here celebrating, celebrating Festivus.
[01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:47.360]   It's the feet.
[01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:48.360]   It's the feet.
[01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:49.360]   It's the feet.
[01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:50.360]   It's the feet.
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:55.360]   It's the strength and the airing of grievances just around the corner on this show.
[01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:58.360]   Ed Bodd is here from ZDNet.
[01:11:58.360 --> 01:11:59.360]   I didn't even put two and two together.
[01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:00.360]   I got two CBS guys on.
[01:12:00.360 --> 01:12:01.360]   I didn't even know.
[01:12:01.360 --> 01:12:04.360]   Jason Einer, CBS Interactive Tech Republic.
[01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:08.360]   That's just because they own everything but to it at this point.
[01:12:08.360 --> 01:12:09.360]   Basically.
[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:14.960]   And I actually, and so if you want to really do this, I used to write for Tech Republic
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:22.360]   back in, no, from 1999 to 2001 or something like that, right?
[01:12:22.360 --> 01:12:25.360]   Yeah, I had the Microsoft challenge.
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:31.840]   They got, if your question got answered or if you answered my question, I forget which one
[01:12:31.840 --> 01:12:36.360]   it was, you got Tech Points.
[01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:39.360]   And what are those Tech Points worth today, Ed Bodd?
[01:12:39.360 --> 01:12:40.360]   Exactly.
[01:12:40.360 --> 01:12:41.360]   In terms of blues.
[01:12:41.360 --> 01:12:44.360]   You have your flues account and your tech points account and I've got my flatter account.
[01:12:44.360 --> 01:12:45.360]   So we're all set.
[01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:49.360]   Also, your Patrick Bejah, not Patrick on Twitter.
[01:12:49.360 --> 01:12:50.360]   Don't understand that.
[01:12:50.360 --> 01:12:51.360]   That is me.
[01:12:51.360 --> 01:12:52.360]   That is him.
[01:12:52.360 --> 01:12:54.360]   Did you order your Mac Pro, not Patrick?
[01:12:54.360 --> 01:12:58.360]   No, who needs a Mac Pro, honestly?
[01:12:58.360 --> 01:13:06.360]   If you're not a video editor or computer graphics artist, you're doing it just too.
[01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:08.360]   But it's so pretty.
[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:09.360]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:13:09.360 --> 01:13:11.360]   Although I wish I could get a red one.
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:14.360]   I can paint it red.
[01:13:14.360 --> 01:13:16.360]   I could just paint it.
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:20.360]   So the Mac Pro went on, sneakily went on sale this week.
[01:13:20.360 --> 01:13:22.360]   We weren't sure when at midnight, I think.
[01:13:22.360 --> 01:13:27.360]   If you didn't order it in the first few minutes, you're out of luck.
[01:13:27.360 --> 01:13:28.720]   You won't be able to get it until February.
[01:13:28.720 --> 01:13:32.960]   Apparently, it was available for December 31st, at least for a little while, but you had
[01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:35.520]   to be up at midnight and so forth.
[01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:39.520]   I was going to order one, but I don't want to wait until February.
[01:13:39.520 --> 01:13:43.800]   So what I'm going to do, my new plan is to go down to the Apple store on December 31st
[01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:49.040]   and hope they get one or two that I can buy on the spot.
[01:13:49.040 --> 01:13:50.240]   Some journalists did get those.
[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:51.360]   Let's get them for review.
[01:13:51.360 --> 01:13:53.480]   I know Jason Stell was tweeting.
[01:13:53.480 --> 01:13:57.840]   He said his is very quiet, but when you put your face next to the top, you get a nice
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:01.120]   bath of warm air coming out of the thing.
[01:14:01.120 --> 01:14:02.880]   Like Molly would got one.
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:04.440]   Not sure who else.
[01:14:04.440 --> 01:14:06.240]   I don't know if she's going to drop it out of an airplane.
[01:14:06.240 --> 01:14:09.000]   She's famous for torture tests.
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:13.040]   But no Mac Pro for us.
[01:14:13.040 --> 01:14:17.680]   Do you think the out of stock stat is coming so fast?
[01:14:17.680 --> 01:14:22.280]   Do you think that's because they're assembled in the US and that has anything to do with
[01:14:22.280 --> 01:14:24.640]   it or?
[01:14:24.640 --> 01:14:27.760]   That's a very good question.
[01:14:27.760 --> 01:14:28.920]   It's a couple of possibilities.
[01:14:28.920 --> 01:14:30.320]   It may be that there are very few of them.
[01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:33.120]   It may be that there's been so much to remember they haven't updated the Mac Pro for three
[01:14:33.120 --> 01:14:36.560]   years that they might have sold 10,000.
[01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:37.880]   We don't know in the first few hours.
[01:14:37.880 --> 01:14:39.480]   I don't know.
[01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:44.120]   It does seem more likely that is a challenging manufacture process.
[01:14:44.120 --> 01:14:51.960]   Remember, they announced this in June and said sometime before the end of the year, I have
[01:14:51.960 --> 01:14:53.320]   a feeling it's hard to make.
[01:14:53.320 --> 01:14:55.120]   The extruded aluminum is not, I'm told.
[01:14:55.120 --> 01:14:58.920]   Apparently, that's a well-known technology.
[01:14:58.920 --> 01:14:59.920]   So I don't know.
[01:14:59.920 --> 01:15:00.920]   That's a good question.
[01:15:00.920 --> 01:15:02.720]   Any thoughts, anybody?
[01:15:02.720 --> 01:15:06.280]   Why the short supply on the Mac Pro?
[01:15:06.280 --> 01:15:09.400]   I don't think it's a question of super high demand.
[01:15:09.400 --> 01:15:18.160]   I think there's a very passionate cohort of designers who want that.
[01:15:18.160 --> 01:15:21.400]   But I don't think that it's one of those things where lots and lots and lots of people are
[01:15:21.400 --> 01:15:23.400]   buying it.
[01:15:23.400 --> 01:15:28.960]   It's going to be a niche product and Apple doesn't really lose anything by not being
[01:15:28.960 --> 01:15:31.280]   able to fulfill the orders for that right away.
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:32.680]   That's true.
[01:15:32.680 --> 01:15:33.680]   You were saying, Jason?
[01:15:33.680 --> 01:15:37.720]   Yeah, obviously, I don't think they made that many.
[01:15:37.720 --> 01:15:42.720]   They're expecting this to be a high-end market.
[01:15:42.720 --> 01:15:48.840]   I think they would prefer not to make the product, honestly, because they're really looking
[01:15:48.840 --> 01:15:50.960]   for markets of scale.
[01:15:50.960 --> 01:15:53.360]   But it would be a bad PR move not to do it.
[01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:59.160]   So I think they figured they can keep some PR by doing it.
[01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:01.800]   They can innovate a little bit on manufacturing.
[01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:04.640]   That's probably a smart thing.
[01:16:04.640 --> 01:16:08.640]   I wonder how passionate they really are about it, the fact that they let the old one lag
[01:16:08.640 --> 01:16:09.920]   for as long as they did.
[01:16:09.920 --> 01:16:13.360]   It shows that they were really on the fence about whether they wanted to play in this
[01:16:13.360 --> 01:16:15.360]   market anymore or not.
[01:16:15.360 --> 01:16:17.760]   It's only $3,000 starting point.
[01:16:17.760 --> 01:16:22.000]   Although it's easy to get it up to almost $10,000 with just a couple of clicks of the
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.520]   mouse.
[01:16:24.520 --> 01:16:30.520]   So it is a specialty computer for the pro audience that Apple has long ago abandoned,
[01:16:30.520 --> 01:16:31.520]   frankly.
[01:16:31.520 --> 01:16:33.520]   Yeah, agree.
[01:16:33.520 --> 01:16:34.520]   It's pretty though.
[01:16:34.520 --> 01:16:35.520]   Very.
[01:16:35.520 --> 01:16:36.520]   Yeah.
[01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:44.240]   But we were thinking they might, as Jason was saying, they might abandon it for years,
[01:16:44.240 --> 01:16:45.240]   actually.
[01:16:45.240 --> 01:16:49.240]   But I really don't think there's a market for it anymore even.
[01:16:49.240 --> 01:16:51.320]   Well, there's a market.
[01:16:51.320 --> 01:16:53.720]   I'll give you an example.
[01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:57.160]   We do our video editing on high-end Mac Pros.
[01:16:57.160 --> 01:16:58.960]   And we've been watching what's happening.
[01:16:58.960 --> 01:17:03.680]   And once they announced this, I decided we're going to move to Windows because we need to
[01:17:03.680 --> 01:17:09.360]   be able to buy late model, relatively affordable machines.
[01:17:09.360 --> 01:17:16.000]   And the Final Cut Pro 10 is unusable for us for a variety of technical reasons.
[01:17:16.000 --> 01:17:17.480]   They abandoned our market.
[01:17:17.480 --> 01:17:18.920]   So we're going to buy Windows in Premiere.
[01:17:18.920 --> 01:17:19.920]   It kills me.
[01:17:19.920 --> 01:17:20.920]   I'm a Mac fan.
[01:17:20.920 --> 01:17:23.240]   But that's what we're going to use because it only makes sense.
[01:17:23.240 --> 01:17:24.960]   And I think that there is a market for that.
[01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:26.400]   And I think they've abandoned it.
[01:17:26.400 --> 01:17:27.400]   It may not be an important one.
[01:17:27.400 --> 01:17:28.400]   Yeah, sure.
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:32.600]   I mean, even Powerwise, a while ago, you would have had, you know, five years ago, even,
[01:17:32.600 --> 01:17:35.880]   you would have had a lot of people who would have wanted the Mac Pro.
[01:17:35.880 --> 01:17:42.040]   Today, you can do pretty much everything except for high-end video editing and computer graphics
[01:17:42.040 --> 01:17:43.040]   calculations.
[01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:44.040]   That's true.
[01:17:44.040 --> 01:17:45.040]   On the laptop.
[01:17:45.040 --> 01:17:46.040]   On the laptop.
[01:17:46.040 --> 01:17:47.960]   The rent is as powerful as my Mac Pro from three years ago.
[01:17:47.960 --> 01:17:48.960]   So...
[01:17:48.960 --> 01:17:49.960]   Power more powerful.
[01:17:49.960 --> 01:17:50.960]   Yeah, from...
[01:17:50.960 --> 01:17:56.400]   So Leo, Apple abandoned you the day that they removed the word "computer" from the company.
[01:17:56.400 --> 01:17:58.720]   That's about the right timing, yeah.
[01:17:58.720 --> 01:18:03.520]   I mean, that's seriously because that's the point where they said we are in the business
[01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:08.760]   of building high-margin consumer devices.
[01:18:08.760 --> 01:18:12.560]   And that's what Microsoft wants to do, right?
[01:18:12.560 --> 01:18:14.720]   For some reason, God.
[01:18:14.720 --> 01:18:15.720]   For some categories.
[01:18:15.720 --> 01:18:23.800]   But Microsoft makes roughly 60% of its, both its revenue and its profits from enterprise
[01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:26.600]   services and software today.
[01:18:26.600 --> 01:18:29.240]   So I don't think that's entirely true.
[01:18:29.240 --> 01:18:36.600]   I mean, they would like to be considered seriously as a maker of consumer goods that
[01:18:36.600 --> 01:18:42.120]   people are passionate about because there's money to be made there.
[01:18:42.120 --> 01:18:50.720]   But it also has a halo effect that bleeds back into the enterprise side.
[01:18:50.720 --> 01:18:52.440]   Who's going to make the truck?
[01:18:52.440 --> 01:18:53.720]   We still need trucks, don't we?
[01:18:53.720 --> 01:18:57.800]   I mean, Steve Jobs said, "There's still people going to need trucks, but most people want
[01:18:57.800 --> 01:18:58.800]   an iPad.
[01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:00.360]   We'll just want a little device."
[01:19:00.360 --> 01:19:01.360]   Who's going to make the trucks?
[01:19:01.360 --> 01:19:02.360]   Because there is some market.
[01:19:02.360 --> 01:19:03.360]   I'm a market for trucks.
[01:19:03.360 --> 01:19:04.720]   Well, there's an interesting...
[01:19:04.720 --> 01:19:12.760]   So the interesting thing is there that it was a beautiful piece of Steve Jobs' sophistry
[01:19:12.760 --> 01:19:16.920]   there where he took a complicated question and turned it into a dichotomy.
[01:19:16.920 --> 01:19:22.200]   And the reality is now that we have a world where we have trucks and we have luxury cars
[01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:30.760]   and we have minivans and we have smart cars and skateboards and bicycles and motorcycles
[01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:32.040]   and everything.
[01:19:32.040 --> 01:19:35.640]   And lots of people have multiple examples of those things.
[01:19:35.640 --> 01:19:41.480]   So the idea that you had to choose between one of those was the great distraction that
[01:19:41.480 --> 01:19:42.480]   he was brilliant.
[01:19:42.480 --> 01:19:43.480]   He was brilliant.
[01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:44.480]   He was brilliant.
[01:19:44.480 --> 01:19:46.000]   It was the thing he did better than anything else.
[01:19:46.000 --> 01:19:47.000]   He just sliced it.
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:48.000]   Just...
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:49.000]   Yeah.
[01:19:49.000 --> 01:19:53.560]   So the truck is the best selling vehicle in the world for 35 years in a row.
[01:19:53.560 --> 01:19:59.120]   So the fact that I did the double take when he did that one.
[01:19:59.120 --> 01:20:05.560]   I understand the analogy and to an extent it works, but it's funny is that the 35 years
[01:20:05.560 --> 01:20:10.440]   in a row, that's the best selling vehicle in the world.
[01:20:10.440 --> 01:20:12.720]   But it's also used for work in the same way.
[01:20:12.720 --> 01:20:17.640]   It actually is pretty decent analogy to the way people work because when you want to get
[01:20:17.640 --> 01:20:20.600]   real work done, people still use...
[01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:26.040]   They still buy in large, especially knowledge workers, sit down and use a computer.
[01:20:26.040 --> 01:20:32.920]   The thing is is why that market has been battered is that people were using computers,
[01:20:32.920 --> 01:20:35.440]   including laptops for so many other things too.
[01:20:35.440 --> 01:20:42.320]   They were buying for this period before really the iPhone and Android kind of hit.
[01:20:42.320 --> 01:20:46.960]   People were buying a lot of second computers because they were being connected more.
[01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:51.760]   So that market, you could say it kind of was almost artificially inflated as people were
[01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:56.320]   buying these second PCs, netbooks, things like this.
[01:20:56.320 --> 01:21:00.440]   What happened is once those second devices came, that market just dropped out.
[01:21:00.440 --> 01:21:02.440]   Nobody was buying netbooks.
[01:21:02.440 --> 01:21:10.440]   Nobody very rarely were buying second laptops anymore to keep cheap on the upstairs in the
[01:21:10.440 --> 01:21:11.440]   bedroom or whatever.
[01:21:11.440 --> 01:21:13.040]   Buy one and give to your kid.
[01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:16.600]   Buy in large, they started buying these small devices.
[01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:22.240]   So a lot of it looks really bad for the PC right now, but essentially what I would think
[01:21:22.240 --> 01:21:26.200]   of is more of the normalization of that market to where the people who really need those
[01:21:26.200 --> 01:21:28.520]   devices, that's what they're getting.
[01:21:28.520 --> 01:21:29.880]   They're still using those for work.
[01:21:29.880 --> 01:21:34.840]   They also last a lot longer than your typical mobile device.
[01:21:34.840 --> 01:21:36.360]   It's still a solid market.
[01:21:36.360 --> 01:21:40.600]   It's just a lot smaller than it was before it got artificially inflated by all this second
[01:21:40.600 --> 01:21:42.440]   PC netbook stuff.
[01:21:42.440 --> 01:21:47.200]   This year, Apple will be celebrating Chinese New Year by finally selling the iPhone on
[01:21:47.200 --> 01:21:50.760]   China Mobile, China's biggest network.
[01:21:50.760 --> 01:21:53.000]   They announced the deal today.
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:58.520]   You'll be able to pre-order Christmas Day 2013 and they'll be available January 17th.
[01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:02.400]   It's both the 5S and the 5C.
[01:22:02.400 --> 01:22:06.040]   And it's interesting that Tim Cook in his statement, one of the first words out of his
[01:22:06.040 --> 01:22:10.160]   mouth is enormous respect for China Mobile.
[01:22:10.160 --> 01:22:14.800]   We have enormous respect for China Mobile.
[01:22:14.800 --> 01:22:21.920]   This is another big market opening up to Apple and it's a market that has been dominated
[01:22:21.920 --> 01:22:22.920]   by Android.
[01:22:22.920 --> 01:22:29.680]   Now, although the iPhone was always in great demand, just in short supply.
[01:22:29.680 --> 01:22:32.480]   So maybe they're making the right move.
[01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:35.880]   Certainly, selling Mac Pros isn't going to make much difference to the bottom line, I
[01:22:35.880 --> 01:22:36.880]   don't think.
[01:22:36.880 --> 01:22:40.280]   Nokia had actually done pretty well in China as well.
[01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:42.280]   Windows Phone is very successful.
[01:22:42.280 --> 01:22:47.240]   Well, I'm talking about pre Windows Phone.
[01:22:47.240 --> 01:22:51.240]   They had done very well.
[01:22:51.240 --> 01:22:57.280]   When you talk about the PC plus, post PC, whatever you want to talk about, a lot of
[01:22:57.280 --> 01:23:06.200]   it has to do with the growth being in emerging markets where people simply can't afford expensive
[01:23:06.200 --> 01:23:07.200]   devices.
[01:23:07.200 --> 01:23:13.000]   And so the challenge, so the interesting thing to have in the iPhone 5S and 5C into China
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:19.640]   is that there's a very large enough group of people who have the money to buy that in
[01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:20.720]   China.
[01:23:20.720 --> 01:23:27.240]   But the really successful products there are going to be the really low-cost ones.
[01:23:27.240 --> 01:23:30.320]   And that's the truth in Brazil and India as well.
[01:23:30.320 --> 01:23:32.800]   Apple doesn't have anything in that category.
[01:23:32.800 --> 01:23:36.080]   There's also power and connectivity problems in emerging markets.
[01:23:36.080 --> 01:23:41.880]   And mobile is just so right in the right spot to solve a lot of those problems.
[01:23:41.880 --> 01:23:51.320]   And if you have an unruly, emo Chinese teenager, he can be making movies while he's paying
[01:23:51.320 --> 01:23:53.840]   no attention to the family.
[01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:57.800]   This is the Apple ad misunderstood, which I've now seen on a couple of NFL games.
[01:23:57.800 --> 01:24:01.120]   They're spending a lot of money because this is a 90 second commercial.
[01:24:01.120 --> 01:24:04.440]   They actually have to buy three ad spots to air the whole thing.
[01:24:04.440 --> 01:24:06.840]   I think there is a cut down that they're showing as well.
[01:24:06.840 --> 01:24:10.400]   But it kind of speaks to anybody who's ever had teenagers.
[01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:14.560]   This kid is apparently ignoring everything that's going on.
[01:24:14.560 --> 01:24:20.000]   Grandpa even had to throw a sock at him at one point just to get him out of his stupor.
[01:24:20.000 --> 01:24:24.200]   And then low and behold, and I know tears are going to come to your eyes when you see
[01:24:24.200 --> 01:24:25.200]   this.
[01:24:25.200 --> 01:24:27.360]   Grandma certainly burst into tears.
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:30.120]   The little kid, the teenager, he's not been ignoring us.
[01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:36.680]   He's been secretly just like the NSA taping our every actions and has made a lovely movie
[01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:37.680]   out of it.
[01:24:37.680 --> 01:24:38.680]   Oh my.
[01:24:38.680 --> 01:24:39.680]   Oh my.
[01:24:39.680 --> 01:24:40.680]   Isn't that beautiful?
[01:24:40.680 --> 01:24:43.040]   So all those things that you saw looked like he was ignoring.
[01:24:43.040 --> 01:24:46.520]   He was really just recording it sideways.
[01:24:46.520 --> 01:24:47.520]   Somebody made it.
[01:24:47.520 --> 01:24:48.520]   Go ahead.
[01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:51.120]   It's a beautiful it's a beautiful ad.
[01:24:51.120 --> 01:24:56.040]   But the only difference with real life is that in real life, the kid is on Snapchat.
[01:24:56.040 --> 01:24:57.200]   Yeah, he's actually not.
[01:24:57.200 --> 01:24:58.840]   He's not meant to move.
[01:24:58.840 --> 01:25:00.240]   This is what you want.
[01:25:00.240 --> 01:25:02.680]   This is what your fantasy is.
[01:25:02.680 --> 01:25:03.680]   Not the reality of it.
[01:25:03.680 --> 01:25:06.680]   But that's what Christmas is all about here.
[01:25:06.680 --> 01:25:09.440]   It's mom and dad and grandma who are going to pay for the iPhones.
[01:25:09.440 --> 01:25:10.440]   That's right.
[01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:11.440]   Exactly.
[01:25:11.440 --> 01:25:12.440]   That's his buying it.
[01:25:12.440 --> 01:25:13.440]   That's who the commercial.
[01:25:13.440 --> 01:25:17.920]   And if Chad wants to play Snapchat all day, well, we'll just have to lay away that.
[01:25:17.920 --> 01:25:19.640]   Oh my.
[01:25:19.640 --> 01:25:21.360]   Yeah, they know how to pull the heartstrings.
[01:25:21.360 --> 01:25:22.360]   You're right.
[01:25:22.360 --> 01:25:26.680]   Apple's still a very, very good marketing company.
[01:25:26.680 --> 01:25:28.280]   No doubt about it.
[01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:31.680]   By the way, this actually this this ad I think is.
[01:25:31.680 --> 01:25:34.280]   Oh, I'm thinking I'm having technical.
[01:25:34.280 --> 01:25:35.280]   Keep talking.
[01:25:35.280 --> 01:25:36.280]   We can hear you.
[01:25:36.280 --> 01:25:37.280]   Oh, okay.
[01:25:37.280 --> 01:25:38.280]   Yeah.
[01:25:38.280 --> 01:25:44.880]   So there's actually a couple of things about this ad that are that are kind of brilliant
[01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:54.280]   or I think will be viewed as and I think could be influential and the way people make ads.
[01:25:54.280 --> 01:26:02.640]   But one of the things that they did I think was they didn't have these very it's a very
[01:26:02.640 --> 01:26:06.400]   grungy, very interesting take on an ad.
[01:26:06.400 --> 01:26:08.440]   One, it's too long.
[01:26:08.440 --> 01:26:10.960]   And I mean this in the sense of they're breaking the rules, right?
[01:26:10.960 --> 01:26:15.720]   They didn't get very sort of polished, good looking people.
[01:26:15.720 --> 01:26:18.600]   It goes on way too long.
[01:26:18.600 --> 01:26:24.040]   It sort of sets us up to look at this and sort of judge this person of like, here's
[01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:29.120]   this why are they putting this little jerk on here that's all he's doing is is ignoring
[01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:30.120]   his family.
[01:26:30.120 --> 01:26:31.120]   We need to be.
[01:26:31.120 --> 01:26:32.480]   Totally setting you up, right?
[01:26:32.480 --> 01:26:33.480]   Right.
[01:26:33.480 --> 01:26:38.480]   And but they're setting you up to that part at the end where then you know they change
[01:26:38.480 --> 01:26:39.480]   your perspective.
[01:26:39.480 --> 01:26:45.200]   Oh, what he was actually doing was something creative, you know, using our tools kind of
[01:26:45.200 --> 01:26:46.200]   thing.
[01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:55.680]   But it breaks a lot of the rules of advertising and ultimately it kind of succeeds in the
[01:26:55.680 --> 01:27:01.440]   fact of getting across that feeling whether you know you believe in it or not.
[01:27:01.440 --> 01:27:03.960]   Like you said, a lot of kids are when they're doing this.
[01:27:03.960 --> 01:27:07.360]   They are actually texting or doing something, you know, not so creative.
[01:27:07.360 --> 01:27:10.760]   That's the first thing that comes into my mind is how is this is phony.
[01:27:10.760 --> 01:27:13.680]   This is a phony baloney ad that this isn't really what's going on.
[01:27:13.680 --> 01:27:14.680]   That's what comes to my mind.
[01:27:14.680 --> 01:27:19.280]   Of course, then I think of the ad that made me cry most last year this time was the Clydesdale
[01:27:19.280 --> 01:27:23.600]   ad the Budweiser ad with a little horse and the guy raises the horse and then the Budweiser
[01:27:23.600 --> 01:27:28.440]   guys take him and then a horse breaks away any kisses him and that was that made me cry
[01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:34.480]   so many of you who's better Google or Apple at making tear jerking ads here is it's not
[01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:35.480]   an ad.
[01:27:35.480 --> 01:27:40.800]   It's the what did the world search for in 2013 the zeitgeist video from Google.
[01:27:40.800 --> 01:27:45.160]   But I got to say this is this is the same exact spirit.
[01:27:45.160 --> 01:27:49.360]   Same even sappy music.
[01:27:49.360 --> 01:27:51.320]   This is new beginnings.
[01:27:51.320 --> 01:27:57.240]   They've got their touching every possible constituency here gay marriage the pope royalty
[01:27:57.240 --> 01:28:04.480]   lovers sci fi fans.
[01:28:04.480 --> 01:28:13.560]   Democrats, Republicans, child throwers, everybody is appealed to.
[01:28:13.560 --> 01:28:18.240]   Actually I think it's a pretty good ad and at least this is a fake right.
[01:28:18.240 --> 01:28:20.920]   Well it's the way you arrange things isn't it.
[01:28:20.920 --> 01:28:23.000]   Yeah good editing.
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:28.920]   Yeah and it and I have to say I like how they end not with people jumping out of a jeep falling
[01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:38.320]   out of the air or the world cup or even the Harlem shake or robots but with the make a
[01:28:38.320 --> 01:28:45.480]   wish kid and that man.
[01:28:45.480 --> 01:28:49.600]   Yeah you know it's it's beautiful and it's really possible to be inspirational about this
[01:28:49.600 --> 01:28:53.880]   kind of stuff but then you go and you look at the actual zeitgeist list and you see that
[01:28:53.880 --> 01:28:55.640]   Miley Cyrus and Greg.
[01:28:55.640 --> 01:28:59.400]   Yeah didn't make it into that list no Miley Cyrus I don't understand it.
[01:28:59.400 --> 01:29:00.400]   Where's the wrecking ball?
[01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:02.360]   Who's the Batman kid?
[01:29:02.360 --> 01:29:03.360]   Love that.
[01:29:03.360 --> 01:29:04.360]   That's a great way to end.
[01:29:04.360 --> 01:29:05.360]   Yeah.
[01:29:05.360 --> 01:29:07.880]   But you're right look at the list it's not any of this.
[01:29:07.880 --> 01:29:10.120]   Don't look at the list.
[01:29:10.120 --> 01:29:11.120]   Do not look at that list.
[01:29:11.120 --> 01:29:12.120]   You'll lose your.
[01:29:12.120 --> 01:29:16.520]   You know what I thought was what I thought was most interesting about the Google zeitgeist
[01:29:16.520 --> 01:29:22.320]   zeitgeist list and I'm glad they do it because it is it is meaningful and important and they
[01:29:22.320 --> 01:29:23.800]   cross categorize it.
[01:29:23.800 --> 01:29:29.000]   What I think is most fascinating is that they do a US version and a worldwide version and
[01:29:29.000 --> 01:29:35.840]   it's really fascinating to see the differences between those two lists and it makes me want
[01:29:35.840 --> 01:29:38.320]   to be a citizen of the world.
[01:29:38.320 --> 01:29:43.880]   So top trending well I shouldn't use trending because that that's more that waits towards
[01:29:43.880 --> 01:29:48.560]   here's let's see people most search people in the year 2013.
[01:29:48.560 --> 01:29:56.160]   The number one person search for 2013 Miley Cyrus then Drake then Kim Kardashian Kardashian
[01:29:56.160 --> 01:29:57.800]   Justin Bieber and Beyonce.
[01:29:57.800 --> 01:30:03.560]   Now that's in the US let's let's quickly see just who were the most searched people in
[01:30:03.560 --> 01:30:08.880]   the world worldwide Nelson Mandela Paul Walker.
[01:30:08.880 --> 01:30:14.280]   Malala we saw her speaking to the UN James Gandolfini and then Miley Cyrus.
[01:30:14.280 --> 01:30:18.480]   So just proves you French people have no interest in culture.
[01:30:18.480 --> 01:30:19.480]   Or twerking.
[01:30:19.480 --> 01:30:23.520]   Do you do people in France twerk?
[01:30:23.520 --> 01:30:27.840]   I go God I hope not.
[01:30:27.840 --> 01:30:38.360]   I'm too old to go on the to go clubbing anymore.
[01:30:38.360 --> 01:30:43.880]   Actually I never went clubbing but I guess maybe they do I really hope they don't though.
[01:30:43.880 --> 01:30:49.280]   Why do Cyrus did get a little bit of air time though even in France so I have to be fair
[01:30:49.280 --> 01:30:52.560]   and say it's not like we ignored her.
[01:30:52.560 --> 01:30:59.880]   The French Academy for all says which is responsible for preserving the the integrity of the French
[01:30:59.880 --> 01:31:05.920]   language has decided that sexting is not a French word.
[01:31:05.920 --> 01:31:10.080]   They have decided that if you want to refer to sexting in France tell me if this is true
[01:31:10.080 --> 01:31:15.040]   Patrick you have to use the word texto pornography.
[01:31:15.040 --> 01:31:24.160]   Well this is kind of true that that organization venerable as it is decides what new words
[01:31:24.160 --> 01:31:28.920]   are going to be introduced in the language and actually they have words for you know email
[01:31:28.920 --> 01:31:37.800]   and a ton of stuff and they they're not them but we are actually find if we use an English
[01:31:37.800 --> 01:31:42.440]   word in a French publication when there is a French equivalent.
[01:31:42.440 --> 01:31:45.600]   This is more for legal documents things like that.
[01:31:45.600 --> 01:31:50.800]   No no no it's even journalists should be using of course texto pornography.
[01:31:50.800 --> 01:31:54.360]   Yes but too much words too many syllables.
[01:31:54.360 --> 01:32:00.920]   Yes but when you say you know I'm sexting someone or maybe someone else is sexting someone.
[01:32:00.920 --> 01:32:02.920]   I say that a lot.
[01:32:02.920 --> 01:32:07.320]   I'm sending a sexto with French word.
[01:32:07.320 --> 01:32:08.320]   Oh it's a lot shorter.
[01:32:08.320 --> 01:32:09.320]   It's a little bit.
[01:32:09.320 --> 01:32:10.320]   Sexto.
[01:32:10.320 --> 01:32:11.320]   Misrepresenting that.
[01:32:11.320 --> 01:32:13.680]   I think we should all call them sextos.
[01:32:13.680 --> 01:32:14.680]   That sounds good.
[01:32:14.680 --> 01:32:19.560]   Other words approved by L'Academy France says general commission on terminology terminology
[01:32:19.560 --> 01:32:24.960]   in word invention only in France would you have a commission on word invention.
[01:32:24.960 --> 01:32:29.400]   They approved a car prenapture which is prenapture agreement.
[01:32:29.400 --> 01:32:38.120]   Sealtranspellsission gold plating, vaudnier empty voting and video agresion which stands
[01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:40.040]   for happy slapping.
[01:32:40.040 --> 01:32:41.040]   That's a British.
[01:32:41.040 --> 01:32:43.120]   I don't know about happy slapping.
[01:32:43.120 --> 01:32:45.320]   Come on man.
[01:32:45.320 --> 01:32:49.720]   It's the British term for what all the news channels think is a trend in the United States
[01:32:49.720 --> 01:32:54.680]   called the knockout game which is in fact not a trend in the United States at all.
[01:32:54.680 --> 01:32:57.880]   Oh like do people slap each other happily?
[01:32:57.880 --> 01:32:58.880]   Yes.
[01:32:58.880 --> 01:33:00.880]   We call it video agresion.
[01:33:00.880 --> 01:33:01.880]   Oh right.
[01:33:01.880 --> 01:33:02.880]   Yes.
[01:33:02.880 --> 01:33:03.880]   Yes.
[01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:07.480]   Happy slapping is a better word I think.
[01:33:07.480 --> 01:33:08.960]   Can you write LOL?
[01:33:08.960 --> 01:33:12.320]   Can you write LOL in France and people know what that means?
[01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:13.320]   Yeah.
[01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:14.320]   Of course.
[01:33:14.320 --> 01:33:15.320]   That's a word.
[01:33:15.320 --> 01:33:16.320]   Yeah.
[01:33:16.320 --> 01:33:19.160]   Well I don't know if it's a word but we use it.
[01:33:19.160 --> 01:33:25.400]   But you know France the French language is regulated by this body whereas the English
[01:33:25.400 --> 01:33:28.840]   language is regulated by nothing and it will be used.
[01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:37.280]   It's a happy slapping though.
[01:33:37.280 --> 01:33:40.080]   It's something that the news channels have made up.
[01:33:40.080 --> 01:33:45.160]   The idea that and they used to call it wilding that gangs of teenagers are going around punching
[01:33:45.160 --> 01:33:48.960]   people and putting it on YouTube.
[01:33:48.960 --> 01:33:51.600]   There's no evidence that in fact this is happening.
[01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:53.880]   Or that it is in any way happy.
[01:33:53.880 --> 01:33:58.600]   Or that it deserves a term in the French lexicon.
[01:33:58.600 --> 01:34:00.520]   So Canada does the same thing.
[01:34:00.520 --> 01:34:04.040]   It's got the office Quebecois de la l'Angres says.
[01:34:04.040 --> 01:34:06.680]   They have coined some words you might be interested in.
[01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:08.520]   Do not say if you are in Quebec.
[01:34:08.520 --> 01:34:10.160]   Do not say podcast.
[01:34:10.160 --> 01:34:13.800]   Say belado diffusion.
[01:34:13.800 --> 01:34:15.760]   Do not say chat.
[01:34:15.760 --> 01:34:18.760]   Say clavaldage.
[01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:25.040]   You know the Canadian thing is really funny because they're so adamant about not using
[01:34:25.040 --> 01:34:29.480]   English words that they even translate things that we in France do not.
[01:34:29.480 --> 01:34:33.680]   They will translate movie titles.
[01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:34.680]   So sometimes we...
[01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:35.680]   I think it's a lot.
[01:34:35.680 --> 01:34:36.680]   You have to.
[01:34:36.680 --> 01:34:38.320]   And it just sounds strange.
[01:34:38.320 --> 01:34:42.440]   Instead of spam they say "pourier" and finally...
[01:34:42.440 --> 01:34:43.440]   And finally...
[01:34:43.440 --> 01:34:44.440]   Do you use that as well?
[01:34:44.440 --> 01:34:45.440]   Like...
[01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:46.440]   Do you use "pourier"?
[01:34:46.440 --> 01:34:47.440]   What does that mean?
[01:34:47.440 --> 01:34:49.200]   It means rotten.
[01:34:49.200 --> 01:34:54.320]   And the "coer" is male and "coer" is email.
[01:34:54.320 --> 01:34:57.520]   And so you get to "coer" and "coer" which is "coer".
[01:34:57.520 --> 01:34:58.520]   Rotten male.
[01:34:58.520 --> 01:34:59.680]   I lost half your audience.
[01:34:59.680 --> 01:35:00.800]   No, I love that.
[01:35:00.800 --> 01:35:01.960]   We should be using that.
[01:35:01.960 --> 01:35:02.960]   Rotten male.
[01:35:02.960 --> 01:35:04.560]   I don't like rotten male.
[01:35:04.560 --> 01:35:05.560]   Spam is not good.
[01:35:05.560 --> 01:35:06.560]   Spam is pork shoulder.
[01:35:06.560 --> 01:35:07.560]   It's delicious.
[01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:09.280]   And finally...
[01:35:09.280 --> 01:35:10.720]   This is from the CBC.
[01:35:10.720 --> 01:35:14.520]   No word yet on whether the French are developing a new term for the Oxford Dictionary.
[01:35:14.520 --> 01:35:16.520]   Word of the Year selfie.
[01:35:16.520 --> 01:35:21.320]   I knew it was so funny because predicting that selfie was going to make it in.
[01:35:21.320 --> 01:35:25.760]   For somebody I was just predicting selfie was going to make it into the Oxford Dictionary
[01:35:25.760 --> 01:35:26.760]   this year.
[01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:27.760]   Selfie.
[01:35:27.760 --> 01:35:30.440]   Totally proved me right.
[01:35:30.440 --> 01:35:33.240]   There is a jailbreak came out for iOS 7.
[01:35:33.240 --> 01:35:34.240]   Took them a while.
[01:35:34.240 --> 01:35:38.160]   This is from the group that does a lot of jailbreaking.
[01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:39.160]   Sorek.
[01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:40.160]   Evasion 7.
[01:35:40.160 --> 01:35:51.080]   And however, Sorek who runs a Sedia is a little concerned because it is no longer Sedia based.
[01:35:51.080 --> 01:35:52.080]   Sedia was the...
[01:35:52.080 --> 01:35:56.920]   So the whole point of jailbreaking when you jailbreak an iOS device is it's not rooting
[01:35:56.920 --> 01:35:57.920]   it.
[01:35:57.920 --> 01:36:00.920]   It's just so that you can use some store besides Apple store.
[01:36:00.920 --> 01:36:02.560]   It's so sad.
[01:36:02.560 --> 01:36:06.440]   These poor people who are stuck with iPhones, they can only buy stuff from Apple.
[01:36:06.440 --> 01:36:09.080]   They're begging, begging for a way out.
[01:36:09.080 --> 01:36:10.760]   So they run this jailbreak.
[01:36:10.760 --> 01:36:15.040]   And normally you'd get Sedia which is J. Freeman's Sorek's store.
[01:36:15.040 --> 01:36:20.080]   But this jailbreak for some reason goes to a secret Chinese app store.
[01:36:20.080 --> 01:36:22.600]   I'm thinking maybe not a good idea.
[01:36:22.600 --> 01:36:24.400]   I don't know.
[01:36:24.400 --> 01:36:29.160]   Why do iPhone owners want to jailbreak their iPhones anymore?
[01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:31.960]   Isn't Android is so good now?
[01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:34.560]   Jailbroken iPhone is basically an Android.
[01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:35.560]   Why not?
[01:36:35.560 --> 01:36:39.040]   If you're so desperate to something more free, why not just get an Android?
[01:36:39.040 --> 01:36:41.980]   I don't see the point at this stage.
[01:36:41.980 --> 01:36:48.420]   The Evasion jailbreak apparently has an unofficial version of Sedia on it and a Chinese cracked
[01:36:48.420 --> 01:36:51.100]   app store known as TEG or TEG.
[01:36:51.100 --> 01:36:53.460]   I mean it could be stuck on it.
[01:36:53.460 --> 01:36:59.200]   It could be stuck in contract on an iPhone or you could have gotten.
[01:36:59.200 --> 01:37:02.360]   There's a lot of old iPhones still in circulation.
[01:37:02.360 --> 01:37:09.000]   Sometimes people have an older iPhone that was a parent or relatives or friends or what
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:11.080]   ever they upgraded.
[01:37:11.080 --> 01:37:13.240]   So they give it away.
[01:37:13.240 --> 01:37:17.440]   So there's lots of reasons why people could have old iPhones and be using that as their
[01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:18.440]   device.
[01:37:18.440 --> 01:37:23.160]   It seems to me if you buy into a gated community it's kind of silly to tear the gate down.
[01:37:23.160 --> 01:37:24.160]   Right?
[01:37:24.160 --> 01:37:28.240]   I mean isn't that why you will go to an iPhone because you want Apple to control what's
[01:37:28.240 --> 01:37:29.240]   on there?
[01:37:29.240 --> 01:37:33.280]   It turns out this TEG app store has a lot of pirated software on it.
[01:37:33.280 --> 01:37:38.840]   The Evasion team says they were approached by TEG to form a partnership but they are
[01:37:38.840 --> 01:37:43.040]   now "deeply sorry and embarrassed" that they did this.
[01:37:43.040 --> 01:37:44.640]   So maybe they'll be a new version.
[01:37:44.640 --> 01:37:47.280]   It just makes me nervous.
[01:37:47.280 --> 01:37:48.560]   Go ahead jailbreak if you want.
[01:37:48.560 --> 01:37:51.760]   I presume if you're jailbreaking you know what you're doing.
[01:37:51.760 --> 01:37:58.280]   Yeah so the only reason that people jailbreak Android devices even is because they want to
[01:37:58.280 --> 01:38:01.800]   get away from the horrible layers of crud.
[01:38:01.800 --> 01:38:02.800]   That's right.
[01:38:02.800 --> 01:38:07.000]   That the providers, the carriers have put on top of it.
[01:38:07.000 --> 01:38:09.360]   They just say I just want you know it's Android.
[01:38:09.360 --> 01:38:10.360]   It's going to be pure Android.
[01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:11.360]   It's going to be pure Android.
[01:38:11.360 --> 01:38:12.360]   Yeah they want to change the ROM.
[01:38:12.360 --> 01:38:13.360]   They want to change the firmware.
[01:38:13.360 --> 01:38:14.360]   Because you don't.
[01:38:14.360 --> 01:38:17.840]   You know all these are checkbox in the settings that say you can buy from any store you want.
[01:38:17.840 --> 01:38:23.120]   No I just started carrying a note 3 which I love the hardware.
[01:38:23.120 --> 01:38:28.240]   How could Lord, between AT&T and Samsung there's so much crap on here.
[01:38:28.240 --> 01:38:29.240]   Oh my gosh.
[01:38:29.240 --> 01:38:30.600]   And it's like that was for the S4.
[01:38:30.600 --> 01:38:34.280]   I love the S4 but I had an AT&T S4.
[01:38:34.280 --> 01:38:36.440]   All kinds of crap wear on it.
[01:38:36.440 --> 01:38:42.480]   Nexus 5 is not a the hardware is uninspiring on the Nexus 5 but the fact that you can you
[01:38:42.480 --> 01:38:44.320]   know you can do tethering on it.
[01:38:44.320 --> 01:38:46.720]   You know you can have Google Wallet.
[01:38:46.720 --> 01:38:51.400]   You can do all kinds of you know all the other stuff that you can't get because of all
[01:38:51.400 --> 01:38:53.720]   the crap where that is loaded on the S4.
[01:38:53.720 --> 01:38:58.520]   You know for that reason alone I ditched the S4 using Nexus 5.
[01:38:58.520 --> 01:39:03.600]   At least Android users can change the launcher and use the launcher that doesn't look quite
[01:39:03.600 --> 01:39:04.800]   so janky.
[01:39:04.800 --> 01:39:10.120]   Looks more generic.
[01:39:10.120 --> 01:39:12.120]   Hey congratulations to Nick Bilton.
[01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:16.120]   His book Hatching Twitter has been optioned for a TV show.
[01:39:16.120 --> 01:39:19.400]   I don't know what kind of TV show that would be.
[01:39:19.400 --> 01:39:21.360]   A movie I could understand.
[01:39:21.360 --> 01:39:24.880]   A TV show is a little bit strange.
[01:39:24.880 --> 01:39:30.120]   My guess when it says TV show is probably sort of mini series kind of thing you know.
[01:39:30.120 --> 01:39:32.040]   It would be a great mini series.
[01:39:32.040 --> 01:39:33.040]   Yeah exactly.
[01:39:33.040 --> 01:39:40.400]   You do it in eight parts kind of like the BBC has sort of made a brilliant work of this
[01:39:40.400 --> 01:39:45.320]   where you take a book and you turn it into an eight part series.
[01:39:45.320 --> 01:39:48.440]   I think they tend to be when books are adapted.
[01:39:48.440 --> 01:39:51.840]   I think they end up being much much better when you do them that way than when you do
[01:39:51.840 --> 01:39:56.120]   them try to crunch it into two hour movie and then you sort of do composite characters
[01:39:56.120 --> 01:39:59.080]   and you do all kinds of other crazy stuff.
[01:39:59.080 --> 01:40:00.240]   I think it's a good book.
[01:40:00.240 --> 01:40:01.240]   I actually enjoyed it.
[01:40:01.240 --> 01:40:02.240]   I love it.
[01:40:02.240 --> 01:40:07.160]   I thought it was written to be made into a television.
[01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:08.400]   Nick's very visual.
[01:40:08.400 --> 01:40:09.600]   I asked him about that.
[01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:15.760]   I said it feels like you're kind of doing a lot of you know conversations that how could
[01:40:15.760 --> 01:40:17.640]   you have been privy to and so forth.
[01:40:17.640 --> 01:40:20.160]   No he said no no I got all this stuff and it's pretty good.
[01:40:20.160 --> 01:40:22.560]   It's a good it's well worth reading.
[01:40:22.560 --> 01:40:26.800]   Speaking of which I think Ed bot was it you who were manually retweeting.
[01:40:26.800 --> 01:40:31.040]   Oh you were you were asked to bring your in trouble Ed bot.
[01:40:31.040 --> 01:40:35.680]   Tell us what is manual retweeting and why in heaven's name.
[01:40:35.680 --> 01:40:44.600]   You know somebody somebody somebody in Essex England I'm told got very upset at me today
[01:40:44.600 --> 01:40:49.440]   because she had she had tweeted something that was actually pretty funny.
[01:40:49.440 --> 01:40:55.200]   The thing that she tweeted was and and remember today is December 21st.
[01:40:55.200 --> 01:40:56.200]   Yes.
[01:40:56.200 --> 01:41:02.800]   So she said I'm so excited only 14 iPhone recharges till Christmas.
[01:41:02.800 --> 01:41:09.360]   And so I thought that was pretty funny and so I put aha ha ha at the front of that and
[01:41:09.360 --> 01:41:13.240]   then RT this woman's name and then her joke.
[01:41:13.240 --> 01:41:15.760]   Well she went ballistic.
[01:41:15.760 --> 01:41:18.040]   She just went completely nuts.
[01:41:18.040 --> 01:41:20.760]   Well because you did it wrong you're tweeting it wrong.
[01:41:20.760 --> 01:41:22.320]   And I don't even follow her.
[01:41:22.320 --> 01:41:28.240]   She said how dare you manually retweet me when you don't even follow me.
[01:41:28.240 --> 01:41:29.680]   Well well well.
[01:41:29.680 --> 01:41:34.600]   I've just had a I was at a complete loss.
[01:41:34.600 --> 01:41:36.160]   So so I deleted it.
[01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:37.160]   Well you know.
[01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:38.600]   Oh I was looking for it.
[01:41:38.600 --> 01:41:43.160]   And of course now you say no manual retweets ever again.
[01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:45.840]   You go ahead and clip if you want.
[01:41:45.840 --> 01:41:46.840]   All right.
[01:41:46.840 --> 01:41:48.480]   Is this you explaining at all?
[01:41:48.480 --> 01:41:50.440]   Oh no no no it's much better than that.
[01:41:50.440 --> 01:41:51.800]   Oh no wire hangers.
[01:41:51.800 --> 01:41:52.800]   Yeah.
[01:41:52.800 --> 01:41:54.600]   I'm not going to play that.
[01:41:54.600 --> 01:41:58.160]   Yeah you probably have to pay some royalties or something if you did that.
[01:41:58.160 --> 01:42:02.440]   But a very very very strange.
[01:42:02.440 --> 01:42:08.160]   So I actually went and looked it up and you know this there's there's there's Twitter
[01:42:08.160 --> 01:42:12.920]   support actually explains to you that you can do it this way or you can do it this way
[01:42:12.920 --> 01:42:14.880]   if you want to add your commentary to it.
[01:42:14.880 --> 01:42:18.800]   So I think it was just somebody having a very bad day.
[01:42:18.800 --> 01:42:24.280]   And by the way to to mark in Vancouver Merry Christmas.
[01:42:24.280 --> 01:42:25.280]   So there.
[01:42:25.280 --> 01:42:26.280]   Oh no.
[01:42:26.280 --> 01:42:29.680]   Got that out of the way.
[01:42:29.680 --> 01:42:34.920]   You know the the iPad and iPhone versions of Twitter allow you to do a manual retweet
[01:42:34.920 --> 01:42:37.240]   that you know there's the option.
[01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:39.560]   So I think it's it's allowed.
[01:42:39.560 --> 01:42:42.840]   All of the mobile versions right.
[01:42:42.840 --> 01:42:49.920]   So like I said I was so I was I was going to say flabbergasted but I'll say I was gobsmacked
[01:42:49.920 --> 01:42:54.960]   by this exchange today in honor of the English origin of it.
[01:42:54.960 --> 01:43:01.120]   And so I looked all this stuff up and on the mobile Twitter sites you have the option
[01:43:01.120 --> 01:43:07.400]   to do either a straight retweet boom hit the RT button and it goes out there under the original
[01:43:07.400 --> 01:43:08.400]   tweeters name.
[01:43:08.400 --> 01:43:11.760]   It's confusing because it doesn't have the RT or anything.
[01:43:11.760 --> 01:43:13.600]   It's just like you it's weird.
[01:43:13.600 --> 01:43:17.600]   You see you all time who would use it's weird.
[01:43:17.600 --> 01:43:18.600]   Yeah.
[01:43:18.600 --> 01:43:20.400]   For newcomers it's like the way it is.
[01:43:20.400 --> 01:43:21.400]   It's normal.
[01:43:21.400 --> 01:43:29.040]   But on the web on Twitter on the web there is no classic RT or manual RT or quoted RT
[01:43:29.040 --> 01:43:30.280]   option.
[01:43:30.280 --> 01:43:35.600]   You have to actually you have to go through about five steps on in the web version of
[01:43:35.600 --> 01:43:38.760]   Twitter to do a manual retweet and add your own commentary.
[01:43:38.760 --> 01:43:39.800]   They don't want you to do it.
[01:43:39.800 --> 01:43:40.800]   Yeah.
[01:43:40.800 --> 01:43:45.880]   So there's a retweet I'm looking at your tweet no manual retweets I can click the retweet
[01:43:45.880 --> 01:43:51.320]   button but all I can do is press a button I can't do anything like the old school.
[01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:54.200]   I could reply and copy and paste or something.
[01:43:54.200 --> 01:43:55.200]   Yeah.
[01:43:55.200 --> 01:43:59.520]   I do this all the time I pull out my phone and I end up using that to so frustrating to
[01:43:59.520 --> 01:44:02.000]   man it is for a copy and paste as well.
[01:44:02.000 --> 01:44:05.560]   So what's wrong Twitter why won't you let us retweet.
[01:44:05.560 --> 01:44:16.440]   You can also use tweet deck on a PC or a Mac and you'll get both the new option and the
[01:44:16.440 --> 01:44:17.920]   classic option.
[01:44:17.920 --> 01:44:22.000]   Twitter is further going to break Twitter because apparently they're investigating the
[01:44:22.000 --> 01:44:26.000]   ability to edit past tweets.
[01:44:26.000 --> 01:44:31.240]   But that's going to be time limited though if the rumors are true it's for typos and things
[01:44:31.240 --> 01:44:32.240]   like that.
[01:44:32.240 --> 01:44:33.240]   Oh that's alright.
[01:44:33.240 --> 01:44:34.240]   Yeah.
[01:44:34.240 --> 01:44:36.960]   It's going to be like five minutes and only for a certain organization.
[01:44:36.960 --> 01:44:38.800]   And once per tweet.
[01:44:38.800 --> 01:44:39.800]   Exactly.
[01:44:39.800 --> 01:44:43.960]   When you tweet something you know breaking news or something that's going to be retweeted
[01:44:43.960 --> 01:44:50.120]   a couple thousand times you don't want to have the typo that makes you look your organization
[01:44:50.120 --> 01:44:52.000]   look like an idiot.
[01:44:52.000 --> 01:44:54.320]   So I can understand why they would do that.
[01:44:54.320 --> 01:44:59.840]   And the reason they don't want you to manually retweet is that they want to be able to track
[01:44:59.840 --> 01:45:02.280]   how tweets travel.
[01:45:02.280 --> 01:45:08.400]   When you push the retweet button it's still the same tweet.
[01:45:08.400 --> 01:45:12.520]   Yeah and so you broke that because you basically there was no way of them knowing that you
[01:45:12.520 --> 01:45:13.960]   had retweeted her.
[01:45:13.960 --> 01:45:14.960]   Yeah.
[01:45:14.960 --> 01:45:15.960]   Exactly.
[01:45:15.960 --> 01:45:16.960]   Yeah.
[01:45:16.960 --> 01:45:17.960]   Bad man.
[01:45:17.960 --> 01:45:18.960]   I'm a bad person.
[01:45:18.960 --> 01:45:23.400]   A terrible terrible human being.
[01:45:23.400 --> 01:45:26.360]   I just don't know how you live.
[01:45:26.360 --> 01:45:30.880]   My dogs love me.
[01:45:30.880 --> 01:45:33.600]   Let's take a break and when we come back I just want to get just a look ahead maybe to
[01:45:33.600 --> 01:45:36.080]   CES and so forth and then we can wrap things up.
[01:45:36.080 --> 01:45:41.160]   We've got a great panel here at bot zdnet.com/blog/bot.
[01:45:41.160 --> 01:45:42.160]   B-O-T-T.
[01:45:42.160 --> 01:45:43.800]   10 years.
[01:45:43.800 --> 01:45:45.320]   A blogger.
[01:45:45.320 --> 01:45:51.520]   And he still has a youthful dewy fresh complexion of a Chinese teenage girl.
[01:45:51.520 --> 01:45:53.120]   I don't know what I'm talking about.
[01:45:53.120 --> 01:46:01.240]   And then next to him Patrick Bezia who after smoking gal was and drinking franette bronca
[01:46:01.240 --> 01:46:03.640]   really does look like he's a lot older than he really is.
[01:46:03.640 --> 01:46:04.640]   Patrick Bezia.
[01:46:04.640 --> 01:46:06.760]   And texto pornography.
[01:46:06.760 --> 01:46:07.920]   Yes.
[01:46:07.920 --> 01:46:10.280]   You've been sex towing again.
[01:46:10.280 --> 01:46:15.160]   Do they drink franette in France or is it just a hipster drink here in the San Francisco
[01:46:15.160 --> 01:46:16.160]   Bay area?
[01:46:16.160 --> 01:46:17.160]   Do they drink what?
[01:46:17.160 --> 01:46:18.160]   I don't know.
[01:46:18.160 --> 01:46:21.320]   You see I know fernet bronco.
[01:46:21.320 --> 01:46:22.320]   It doesn't ring a bell.
[01:46:22.320 --> 01:46:23.320]   I thought so.
[01:46:23.320 --> 01:46:26.680]   Ladies and gentlemen also, oh we've lost Jason Heiner.
[01:46:26.680 --> 01:46:32.200]   He's been coming and going the whole show and I've been deftly avoiding showing that.
[01:46:32.200 --> 01:46:34.040]   But I blew it for you Anthony.
[01:46:34.040 --> 01:46:35.040]   Sorry.
[01:46:35.040 --> 01:46:36.960]   Jason Heiner from Tech Republic.

[01:46:47.320 --> 01:46:48.680]   I don't blame them.
[01:46:48.680 --> 01:46:52.000]   But if your business is mailing stuff that's you don't want to go in there with all the
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:53.000]   amateurs in there.
[01:46:53.000 --> 01:46:56.240]   That's why you should be using stamps.com.

[01:48:00.240 --> 01:48:01.240]   I got a good deal for you.
[01:48:01.240 --> 01:48:05.640]   If you go to stamps.com right now, don't take that special Santa Claus offer on the front
[01:48:05.640 --> 01:48:06.640]   page there.
[01:48:06.640 --> 01:48:11.120]   No, click the radio microphone and enter our offer code TWIT, just to let them know you
[01:48:11.120 --> 01:48:13.120]   heard about this on Twitch.
[01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:16.160]   They're going to turn that $80 value to $110 bonus value.
[01:48:16.160 --> 01:48:20.360]   You get $55 in free postage to use over the first few months of your stamps account, a
[01:48:20.360 --> 01:48:25.960]   free digital scale, $5 supply kit, and of course, four week trial of stamps.com.
[01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:26.960]   Go there right now.
[01:48:26.960 --> 01:48:27.960]   Click their microphone.
[01:48:27.960 --> 01:48:32.200]   Stamps.com, use the offer code TWIT.
[01:48:32.200 --> 01:48:37.000]   One of the things that supposedly we'll hear about is new plans for a T-Mobile Uncarrier
[01:48:37.000 --> 01:48:39.160]   4.0 at CES.
[01:48:39.160 --> 01:48:44.160]   I've been a little underwhelmed, but I love T-Mobile, but it's not exactly like they've
[01:48:44.160 --> 01:48:48.440]   eliminated any of the carrier stuff that they do.
[01:48:48.440 --> 01:48:51.480]   So I'm curious, they apparently have done away with contracts.
[01:48:51.480 --> 01:48:54.880]   They've kind of done away with device subsidies.
[01:48:54.880 --> 01:48:57.240]   They have that jump early upgrade program.
[01:48:57.240 --> 01:48:59.960]   What else is coming from a T-Mobile?
[01:48:59.960 --> 01:49:04.800]   They say something you're not going to believe.
[01:49:04.800 --> 01:49:09.840]   Okay, well, I guess we won't be talking.
[01:49:09.840 --> 01:49:10.840]   What could it be?
[01:49:10.840 --> 01:49:11.920]   They sent out invitations.
[01:49:11.920 --> 01:49:12.920]   No idea.
[01:49:12.920 --> 01:49:16.360]   Are you going to go to the party at the January?
[01:49:16.360 --> 01:49:17.360]   No, no.
[01:49:17.360 --> 01:49:19.360]   I get dinner plans at night.
[01:49:19.360 --> 01:49:21.120]   But Ed, you're not going to believe it.
[01:49:21.120 --> 01:49:22.920]   You won't believe it.
[01:49:22.920 --> 01:49:25.160]   They're going to show.
[01:49:25.160 --> 01:49:29.840]   You know, I'll be able to watch the entire thing on my smartphone from dinner.
[01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:30.840]   Why do you go to CES?
[01:49:30.840 --> 01:49:32.240]   See, now the truth comes out.
[01:49:32.240 --> 01:49:34.840]   You're really just going because you get dinner and you get to meet your old friends
[01:49:34.840 --> 01:49:37.200]   and have some fun in Vegas.
[01:49:37.200 --> 01:49:46.000]   If you could see my CES schedule, it is seriously, I think I'm probably going to walk 18 miles
[01:49:46.000 --> 01:49:48.000]   every day.
[01:49:48.000 --> 01:49:50.200]   That's how many meetings I have set up.
[01:49:50.200 --> 01:49:55.360]   So I'm working my tail off at CES.
[01:49:55.360 --> 01:50:02.200]   And actually, having mobile devices has really made it possible for me to organize my CES
[01:50:02.200 --> 01:50:05.120]   schedule in a way that wasn't possible five years ago.
[01:50:05.120 --> 01:50:07.960]   So it's sort of fascinating.
[01:50:07.960 --> 01:50:13.520]   Technology is catching up with CES, which is not the consumer electronic show.
[01:50:13.520 --> 01:50:14.520]   It's just CES.
[01:50:14.520 --> 01:50:17.520]   But T-Mobile is not on my...
[01:50:17.520 --> 01:50:19.920]   I don't think they even sent me that invitation.
[01:50:19.920 --> 01:50:23.520]   And I got 750 invitations.
[01:50:23.520 --> 01:50:25.000]   I have never seen a...
[01:50:25.000 --> 01:50:26.000]   And I'm not even going.
[01:50:26.000 --> 01:50:28.960]   And I've never seen the volume of email I got this year from people saying...
[01:50:28.960 --> 01:50:29.960]   A stonage.
[01:50:29.960 --> 01:50:30.960]   It is more, isn't it?
[01:50:30.960 --> 01:50:31.960]   Would you like a meeting?
[01:50:31.960 --> 01:50:32.960]   Can we talk to you?
[01:50:32.960 --> 01:50:33.960]   There's more.
[01:50:33.960 --> 01:50:34.960]   Wow.
[01:50:34.960 --> 01:50:37.760]   I think it's the Internet of Things.
[01:50:37.760 --> 01:50:39.120]   I think there's really...
[01:50:39.120 --> 01:50:42.320]   Truly, there are a lot of stuff.
[01:50:42.320 --> 01:50:51.680]   Yeah, I actually called it the Internet of Stuff in my CES pre-show report on CDNet.
[01:50:51.680 --> 01:50:57.760]   I said, "I'm going there just to see the Internet of Stuff with Anand to George Carland."
[01:50:57.760 --> 01:51:05.720]   But I think there's so many interesting niches of technology, sensors and microprocessors
[01:51:05.720 --> 01:51:13.800]   and connected smart things and health-related stuff with the Affordable Care Act coming.
[01:51:13.800 --> 01:51:16.920]   There's going to be a lot of innovation in there, too.
[01:51:16.920 --> 01:51:19.440]   Now you're making me want to go.
[01:51:19.440 --> 01:51:20.440]   I feel bad.
[01:51:20.440 --> 01:51:21.440]   I'm not going.
[01:51:21.440 --> 01:51:24.440]   I'm going to be Vegas the day before.
[01:51:24.440 --> 01:51:26.520]   Monday is the new media expo.
[01:51:26.520 --> 01:51:30.360]   I'm giving a keynote at the new media expo and then I'm leaving before CDNet starts.
[01:51:30.360 --> 01:51:31.360]   Am I crazy?
[01:51:31.360 --> 01:51:32.880]   I should stick around.
[01:51:32.880 --> 01:51:34.120]   Just hang out.
[01:51:34.120 --> 01:51:40.120]   So the rumors include things like paying early termination fees for people to leave their
[01:51:40.120 --> 01:51:41.120]   carrier.
[01:51:41.120 --> 01:51:43.080]   That would be interesting.
[01:51:43.080 --> 01:51:47.120]   I do have to say I love it that they're offering, even though it's edge only, they're offering
[01:51:47.120 --> 01:51:49.240]   unlimited international roaming.
[01:51:49.240 --> 01:51:51.760]   That's a nice thing for people who travel.
[01:51:51.760 --> 01:51:53.160]   I want T-Mobile to succeed.
[01:51:53.160 --> 01:51:58.640]   The other rumor is that Sprint's bidding to buy them, which would be sad.
[01:51:58.640 --> 01:52:03.040]   But that wouldn't justify that tagline that they had there.
[01:52:03.040 --> 01:52:07.880]   Oh, I'm trying to think of what would.
[01:52:07.880 --> 01:52:08.880]   I can't.
[01:52:08.880 --> 01:52:09.880]   Something that won't fill the key.
[01:52:09.880 --> 01:52:13.720]   We're either all going to be completely shocked or disappointed.
[01:52:13.720 --> 01:52:14.720]   Or disappointed.
[01:52:14.720 --> 01:52:15.720]   Or disappointed.
[01:52:15.720 --> 01:52:19.720]   My money's on the ladder given previous CES press.
[01:52:19.720 --> 01:52:28.560]   I mean, you can tell that they're taking risks and they're trying to be the...
[01:52:28.560 --> 01:52:30.120]   They have to.
[01:52:30.120 --> 01:52:32.120]   They have to, exactly.
[01:52:32.120 --> 01:52:33.120]   And I like that they are.
[01:52:33.120 --> 01:52:38.200]   I like that they are taking some risks because they're trying to do things differently.
[01:52:38.200 --> 01:52:44.360]   And yeah, they're sort of the non-carrier carriers, their whole thing.
[01:52:44.360 --> 01:52:45.440]   And good for them.
[01:52:45.440 --> 01:52:50.720]   I do not want to see them get bought by either ATT or Sprint.
[01:52:50.720 --> 01:52:51.720]   Or Dish.
[01:52:51.720 --> 01:52:52.720]   Or Dish.
[01:52:52.720 --> 01:52:53.720]   Apparently Dish is in there.
[01:52:53.720 --> 01:52:55.640]   Although Charlie Ergan and Dish does this all the time.
[01:52:55.640 --> 01:52:56.880]   He just takes runs and stuff.
[01:52:56.880 --> 01:52:57.880]   He knows he's not going to get it.
[01:52:57.880 --> 01:52:59.880]   He just likes the press.
[01:52:59.880 --> 01:53:05.080]   But if Sprint buys them, doesn't that mean that SoftBank then owns them?
[01:53:05.080 --> 01:53:06.080]   Everything.
[01:53:06.080 --> 01:53:07.080]   Then they would own everything.
[01:53:07.080 --> 01:53:08.080]   Yes.
[01:53:08.080 --> 01:53:09.080]   They would own all the old followers.
[01:53:09.080 --> 01:53:11.160]   And as somebody who has first-hand experience with SoftBank...
[01:53:11.160 --> 01:53:12.160]   As do I.
[01:53:12.160 --> 01:53:13.160]   As do I.
[01:53:13.160 --> 01:53:16.480]   Those of us who do not want.
[01:53:16.480 --> 01:53:17.720]   So they just take...
[01:53:17.720 --> 01:53:20.640]   They bought Ziff Davis, we should mention at one point.
[01:53:20.640 --> 01:53:21.640]   Yeah.
[01:53:21.640 --> 01:53:22.640]   Masayoshi Son.
[01:53:22.640 --> 01:53:23.640]   Tim Draper.
[01:53:23.640 --> 01:53:29.960]   It's becoming the punchline now.
[01:53:29.960 --> 01:53:31.440]   He is a venture capitalist.
[01:53:31.440 --> 01:53:32.880]   He has said that we want...
[01:53:32.880 --> 01:53:40.360]   He wants to split California into six pieces and make Silicon Valley its own state.
[01:53:40.360 --> 01:53:45.360]   Would we be in... or would we be part of this blue state that has no revenue at all up
[01:53:45.360 --> 01:53:46.360]   in the North there?
[01:53:46.360 --> 01:53:47.520]   I think that's where we would be.
[01:53:47.520 --> 01:53:52.360]   The purple is the valuable real estate.
[01:53:52.360 --> 01:53:55.280]   Six Californians, he's actually...
[01:53:55.280 --> 01:54:00.080]   Given the way the ballot measures work in California, it's almost certain that he will
[01:54:00.080 --> 01:54:03.040]   be able to get this on the ballot.
[01:54:03.040 --> 01:54:04.280]   Because all you have to do is put out...
[01:54:04.280 --> 01:54:06.280]   If you've got the money, you can get signatures.
[01:54:06.280 --> 01:54:07.280]   Oh.
[01:54:07.280 --> 01:54:12.000]   Okay, so this is the... so Colorado, he's just copying Colorado.
[01:54:12.000 --> 01:54:14.160]   Colorado is six states now?
[01:54:14.160 --> 01:54:15.160]   No, no, no.
[01:54:15.160 --> 01:54:24.760]   There's a group of right wing nuts in Northern Colorado who want to partition off the six
[01:54:24.760 --> 01:54:29.520]   counties that they represent into a separate state.
[01:54:29.520 --> 01:54:32.800]   They want to just spin it off because they're tired of all the...
[01:54:32.800 --> 01:54:36.720]   All those liberal lefties from Boulder and Denver screwing with them.
[01:54:36.720 --> 01:54:37.720]   Boulder and Denver.
[01:54:37.720 --> 01:54:39.880]   They'd like to bring Colorado Springs with them, but they...
[01:54:39.880 --> 01:54:41.880]   So they want...
[01:54:41.880 --> 01:54:44.160]   They'd like to have their own airports.
[01:54:44.160 --> 01:54:49.080]   Tim wants West California, which would be LA, Santa Barbara.
[01:54:49.080 --> 01:54:52.080]   They can have... actually, you can have West Carolina.
[01:54:52.080 --> 01:54:53.080]   Yeah.
[01:54:53.080 --> 01:54:55.240]   And then you get Orange County, San Diego.
[01:54:55.240 --> 01:54:56.240]   Yeah.
[01:54:56.240 --> 01:54:57.680]   And then you got the Central Valley.
[01:54:57.680 --> 01:54:59.880]   It's going to look very odd.
[01:54:59.880 --> 01:55:06.040]   But isn't the joker in all of this that the federal government gets to say under the
[01:55:06.040 --> 01:55:07.040]   Constitution?
[01:55:07.040 --> 01:55:08.040]   No, yes.
[01:55:08.040 --> 01:55:09.040]   No.
[01:55:09.040 --> 01:55:10.040]   Can't do that.
[01:55:10.040 --> 01:55:11.040]   No, you can't do that.
[01:55:11.040 --> 01:55:12.680]   Yeah, we fought a civil war over those kinds of things, just not so long ago.
[01:55:12.680 --> 01:55:13.680]   This is not...
[01:55:13.680 --> 01:55:15.720]   You guys could do whatever you want with the...
[01:55:15.720 --> 01:55:16.720]   You can change the...
[01:55:16.720 --> 01:55:20.480]   You got one of their 43 counties in California.
[01:55:20.480 --> 01:55:21.800]   You can chop those.
[01:55:21.800 --> 01:55:22.800]   I'm a lifelong...
[01:55:22.800 --> 01:55:26.400]   I was raised in California, so I think I can say this.
[01:55:26.400 --> 01:55:27.400]   This is nuts.
[01:55:27.400 --> 01:55:29.800]   This is just a bunch.
[01:55:29.800 --> 01:55:36.000]   None of your than Peter Thiel, the guy who made a lot of money on Facebook, founded PayPal,
[01:55:36.000 --> 01:55:40.240]   he is putting money into a libertarian sea colony.
[01:55:40.240 --> 01:55:44.680]   Yeah, I like to call these guys "glippertarians."
[01:55:44.680 --> 01:55:50.440]   You know, everything would be just so easy if we didn't have...
[01:55:50.440 --> 01:55:52.280]   We only had an island with no regulation.
[01:55:52.280 --> 01:55:53.880]   Oh, that's Larry Page's idea.
[01:55:53.880 --> 01:55:58.400]   Actually, Thiel was paying high school kids $100,000 not to go to college.
[01:55:58.400 --> 01:56:00.200]   That seems like...
[01:56:00.200 --> 01:56:01.200]   Wow.
[01:56:01.200 --> 01:56:11.200]   He's investing one and a quarter million into floating autonomous colonies and seeing...
[01:56:11.200 --> 01:56:12.440]   The Sea Stedding Institute.
[01:56:12.440 --> 01:56:13.600]   I think that this is...
[01:56:13.600 --> 01:56:15.200]   Somebody was talking about this.
[01:56:15.200 --> 01:56:24.600]   The idea was to take old, discontinued oil wells, you know, platforms and turn them into
[01:56:24.600 --> 01:56:25.600]   countries.
[01:56:25.600 --> 01:56:27.600]   Well, you can...
[01:56:27.600 --> 01:56:32.400]   That now, but when the robots overload arrive and revolt...
[01:56:32.400 --> 01:56:33.400]   That's true.
[01:56:33.400 --> 01:56:36.120]   You'll be glad when the zombies come you'll be glad you're on that platform.
[01:56:36.120 --> 01:56:39.760]   And the horrible thing is the singularity is going to happen and we're going to have
[01:56:39.760 --> 01:56:42.160]   to live in this new world forever.
[01:56:42.160 --> 01:56:44.880]   By the way, we just did a really great...
[01:56:44.880 --> 01:56:46.760]   I'm going to do a quick plug.
[01:56:46.760 --> 01:56:48.560]   Plug, plug, plug, yes.
[01:56:48.560 --> 01:56:51.680]   We just did a great story on the idea of killer robots.
[01:56:51.680 --> 01:56:53.280]   This is actually a real thing that...
[01:56:53.280 --> 01:56:55.800]   There's legislation happening around this right now.
[01:56:55.800 --> 01:57:02.280]   And Steve Ranger, one of our editor, the editor of Tech Republic in the UK did a great,
[01:57:02.280 --> 01:57:08.760]   great story on this, on the legislation that basically no kill robots, not giving robots
[01:57:08.760 --> 01:57:09.760]   the ability.
[01:57:09.760 --> 01:57:12.880]   This includes drones and other things.
[01:57:12.880 --> 01:57:17.520]   But one of the great things he did in this story was he talked to people in artificial
[01:57:17.520 --> 01:57:21.600]   intelligence to ask them like, "How close really are we?"
[01:57:21.600 --> 01:57:23.600]   And the answer is not very...
[01:57:23.600 --> 01:57:31.240]   So, yeah, but there is already legislation being passed and movements in UN and other
[01:57:31.240 --> 01:57:38.920]   places about putting together these treaties on not allowing drones to make decisions to
[01:57:38.920 --> 01:57:41.520]   kill human beings and why that is.
[01:57:41.520 --> 01:57:44.800]   And it really gets into this issue.
[01:57:44.800 --> 01:57:46.680]   And it's quite fascinating.
[01:57:46.680 --> 01:57:47.680]   It's good stuff.
[01:57:47.680 --> 01:57:56.560]   So, robots of war, robots of love, and then because it also gets into the fact that robots,
[01:57:56.560 --> 01:58:00.760]   you know, people want to use robots to like care for the elderly, for example, and do
[01:58:00.760 --> 01:58:01.760]   other things.
[01:58:01.760 --> 01:58:07.600]   And when you put those two together, robots that care for the elderly and have the right
[01:58:07.600 --> 01:58:08.600]   to decide.
[01:58:08.600 --> 01:58:10.600]   Perfect timing, yes.
[01:58:10.600 --> 01:58:11.600]   That's good.
[01:58:11.600 --> 01:58:12.600]   Does he say...
[01:58:12.600 --> 01:58:15.520]   Because this is the prime directive, right?
[01:58:15.520 --> 01:58:16.520]   Right.
[01:58:16.520 --> 01:58:19.440]   But we don't have Asimov's rules for robotics.
[01:58:19.440 --> 01:58:21.320]   And it goes into Asimov's rules too.
[01:58:21.320 --> 01:58:22.320]   And why they're there.
[01:58:22.320 --> 01:58:27.680]   So, it does a great, you know, evaluation of them and with these sort of experts who
[01:58:27.680 --> 01:58:30.680]   are working on AI and all of these things.
[01:58:30.680 --> 01:58:32.360]   And so, yeah, it's good stuff.
[01:58:32.360 --> 01:58:37.480]   Sorry to conflate Star Trek with Isaac Asimov there.
[01:58:37.480 --> 01:58:39.000]   I apologize.
[01:58:39.000 --> 01:58:40.000]   Three laws, yeah.
[01:58:40.000 --> 01:58:41.000]   Yeah.
[01:58:41.000 --> 01:58:42.000]   Last story.
[01:58:42.000 --> 01:58:43.000]   Wow.
[01:58:43.000 --> 01:58:47.440]   102 City Tour.
[01:58:47.440 --> 01:58:52.960]   Just kind of manages to a 14 Trek 17 video album somewhere in between there.
[01:58:52.960 --> 01:58:59.440]   Sells a million copies on iTunes in a week.
[01:58:59.440 --> 01:59:00.440]   But she made a little mistake.
[01:59:00.440 --> 01:59:01.440]   She...
[01:59:01.440 --> 01:59:02.440]   Maybe not.
[01:59:02.440 --> 01:59:04.920]   She made it exclusively on iTunes where it sold very well.
[01:59:04.920 --> 01:59:09.720]   And by the way, using social media brilliantly, she just did...
[01:59:09.720 --> 01:59:10.960]   She just killed it.
[01:59:10.960 --> 01:59:13.360]   Well, now Amazon and Target said, "Well, that's that.
[01:59:13.360 --> 01:59:16.160]   We're not selling the CD."
[01:59:16.160 --> 01:59:17.960]   So who cares?
[01:59:17.960 --> 01:59:20.480]   I don't know.
[01:59:20.480 --> 01:59:26.720]   To me, the biggest, the most interesting part of that story was that they kept it a secret.
[01:59:26.720 --> 01:59:28.640]   Unbelievable.
[01:59:28.640 --> 01:59:33.760]   She made this code name Lily, I believe it was, right?
[01:59:33.760 --> 01:59:34.760]   Yeah.
[01:59:34.760 --> 01:59:38.440]   Well, the album is just Beyonce.
[01:59:38.440 --> 01:59:39.960]   Pretty impressive.
[01:59:39.960 --> 01:59:43.560]   And also showing a mastery of social media, of the internet.
[01:59:43.560 --> 01:59:48.080]   And sorry Amazon and Target, I guess that's that.
[01:59:48.080 --> 01:59:50.640]   Physical media is dead.
[01:59:50.640 --> 01:59:51.640]   Just like that.
[01:59:51.640 --> 01:59:53.600]   People still buy music.
[01:59:53.600 --> 01:59:54.600]   Who knew?
[01:59:54.600 --> 01:59:55.600]   Who knew?
[01:59:55.600 --> 01:59:57.520]   Well, I guess, yeah, they do.
[01:59:57.520 --> 02:00:01.600]   And it's just the first week that she sold a million in.
[02:00:01.600 --> 02:00:04.920]   But a million is $10 million, right?
[02:00:04.920 --> 02:00:08.120]   And out of this, she's going to see 6.6.
[02:00:08.120 --> 02:00:13.880]   And when we say she, the company with a lot of overhead.
[02:00:13.880 --> 02:00:18.280]   So yes, it's a lot of money and it's a lot of CDs.
[02:00:18.280 --> 02:00:25.120]   I mean, of albums sold, is it that much of an impressive figure?
[02:00:25.120 --> 02:00:26.320]   It's pretty good for one week.
[02:00:26.320 --> 02:00:27.320]   We'll see.
[02:00:27.320 --> 02:00:29.200]   Maybe for one week to rock.
[02:00:29.200 --> 02:00:33.960]   You know, I mean, Instagram, Twitter, Facebook, just going crazy with Beyonce stuff.
[02:00:33.960 --> 02:00:37.440]   I mean, really, she knocked it out of the park.
[02:00:37.440 --> 02:00:41.120]   And I think it's so ironic that it's Amazon and Target that are saying, well, in that
[02:00:41.120 --> 02:00:44.520]   case, we're not going to sell the CD.
[02:00:44.520 --> 02:00:46.960]   But I guess my point is that might be a problem.
[02:00:46.960 --> 02:00:47.960]   In the end.
[02:00:47.960 --> 02:00:48.960]   For her, you think?
[02:00:48.960 --> 02:00:50.960]   Yeah, it might be.
[02:00:50.960 --> 02:00:51.960]   You know what?
[02:00:51.960 --> 02:00:54.400]   Why don't you come back in about three weeks and we'll talk about it.
[02:00:54.400 --> 02:00:55.400]   You sound good?
[02:00:55.400 --> 02:00:56.400]   Yeah.
[02:00:56.400 --> 02:01:03.400]   Patrick Bezha, not Patrick on the Twitter where he will not retweet you.
[02:01:03.400 --> 02:01:05.040]   No manual retweeting for this guy.
[02:01:05.040 --> 02:01:06.040]   Patrick Bezha, that come.
[02:01:06.040 --> 02:01:07.040]   Great to have you on, Patrick.
[02:01:07.040 --> 02:01:08.040]   Always good to see you.
[02:01:08.040 --> 02:01:09.040]   Thank you.
[02:01:09.040 --> 02:01:12.120]   Thanks to Jason Heiner of the Tech Republic and CBS Interactive.
[02:01:12.120 --> 02:01:15.200]   Always good to see you at Jason Heiner on the Twitter.
[02:01:15.200 --> 02:01:16.200]   Thank you.
[02:01:16.200 --> 02:01:17.200]   Sorry for the technical problems.
[02:01:17.200 --> 02:01:18.200]   It's not your fault.
[02:01:18.200 --> 02:01:19.200]   It's not your fault.
[02:01:19.200 --> 02:01:20.840]   I'm Warner just took over our cable.
[02:01:20.840 --> 02:01:22.120]   I'm going to eliminate them.
[02:01:22.120 --> 02:01:25.400]   I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to, I'm going to say things about
[02:01:25.400 --> 02:01:27.440]   them and I want everybody to retweet it.
[02:01:27.440 --> 02:01:28.440]   I'm not yet.
[02:01:28.440 --> 02:01:29.440]   Wait until this shows over.
[02:01:29.440 --> 02:01:30.440]   Send it drone.
[02:01:30.440 --> 02:01:33.840]   I think I just, I think I just got cut off.
[02:01:33.840 --> 02:01:35.240]   I just got cut off.
[02:01:35.240 --> 02:01:36.240]   Sorry.
[02:01:36.240 --> 02:01:41.800]   And, and by the way, coffee, coffee geek on the, on the Twitter says that, "Frenet Bronka
[02:01:41.800 --> 02:01:46.640]   is the bartender's secret friend tastes like Jaeger Meisser but without all the sugar."
[02:01:46.640 --> 02:01:47.640]   Wow.
[02:01:47.640 --> 02:01:49.800]   Well, I, I looked it up.
[02:01:49.800 --> 02:01:53.480]   It's apparently it's Italian and it looks incredibly hipsterish.
[02:01:53.480 --> 02:01:54.480]   It's so hipster.
[02:01:54.480 --> 02:01:55.480]   Yeah.
[02:01:55.480 --> 02:01:57.480]   It's the hipster drink in San Francisco.
[02:01:57.480 --> 02:01:59.560]   Hey, can I, can I plug one thing, you know?
[02:01:59.560 --> 02:02:00.560]   Yeah.
[02:02:00.560 --> 02:02:01.560]   If you say no.
[02:02:01.560 --> 02:02:02.560]   No, I insist.
[02:02:02.560 --> 02:02:10.560]   Just my, my brother who's a very talented musician launched a few weeks ago his royalty
[02:02:10.560 --> 02:02:14.800]   free music website called Music in Cloud.
[02:02:14.800 --> 02:02:18.320]   It's musicincloud.com and he is actually very good.
[02:02:18.320 --> 02:02:21.320]   I'm not saying that because he is my brother.
[02:02:21.320 --> 02:02:25.280]   So if you're, if you need royalty free music, please go check it out.
[02:02:25.280 --> 02:02:27.560]   Well, that's awesome.
[02:02:27.560 --> 02:02:29.480]   So it's like a clip art for music.
[02:02:29.480 --> 02:02:30.480]   Yeah.
[02:02:30.480 --> 02:02:31.480]   Yeah, yeah.
[02:02:31.480 --> 02:02:33.120]   If you need, you know, some roles.
[02:02:33.120 --> 02:02:37.360]   Is it all his stuff or is it other people too?
[02:02:37.360 --> 02:02:39.920]   It's him, him and his wife actually.
[02:02:39.920 --> 02:02:46.200]   And he is actually, he does a lot of stuff that is incredibly good.
[02:02:46.200 --> 02:02:49.280]   I was surprised at the variety of things he offers.
[02:02:49.280 --> 02:02:54.280]   So most timing is good with the YouTube just taking down everybody left, right and center.
[02:02:54.280 --> 02:02:58.440]   It's a good place to go to get some royalty free music, which I am now playing without
[02:02:58.440 --> 02:02:59.800]   paying for.
[02:02:59.800 --> 02:03:02.040]   So it's a promotion.
[02:03:02.040 --> 02:03:03.120]   It's a promotion.
[02:03:03.120 --> 02:03:04.120]   That's it.
[02:03:04.120 --> 02:03:05.720]   I give you the, you know, the promise.
[02:03:05.720 --> 02:03:06.720]   This is good.
[02:03:06.720 --> 02:03:07.720]   This is like Django.
[02:03:07.720 --> 02:03:08.720]   This is awesome.
[02:03:08.720 --> 02:03:12.960]   Originally he's a, he does a Manus Jazz.
[02:03:12.960 --> 02:03:14.280]   Is it Manus Jazz you say?
[02:03:14.280 --> 02:03:15.720]   I don't know what the Django basically.
[02:03:15.720 --> 02:03:16.720]   Django.
[02:03:16.720 --> 02:03:18.920]   But he does a whole bunch of different things.
[02:03:18.920 --> 02:03:19.920]   Awesome stuff.
[02:03:19.920 --> 02:03:20.920]   Yeah.
[02:03:20.920 --> 02:03:21.920]   Thank you, Patrick.
[02:03:21.920 --> 02:03:28.120]   Thank you to Ed Bot too at zdnet.com/blog/bot where he has been.
[02:03:28.120 --> 02:03:29.120]   Pleasure Leo.
[02:03:29.120 --> 02:03:34.120]   And years, but I've known him for 20.
[02:03:34.120 --> 02:03:35.120]   Amazing.
[02:03:35.120 --> 02:03:36.400]   Thank you everybody.
[02:03:36.400 --> 02:03:41.000]   We do this week and tech every Sunday afternoon, 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern time.
[02:03:41.000 --> 02:03:42.920]   2200 UTC on twit.tv.
[02:03:42.920 --> 02:03:46.880]   Now I got to tell you, we will be doing a special episode next week.
[02:03:46.880 --> 02:03:48.240]   So I won't be here.
[02:03:48.240 --> 02:03:51.640]   That's actually will be here that Sunday because I'm doing the radio show, but I'll
[02:03:51.640 --> 02:03:52.640]   just leave early, right?
[02:03:52.640 --> 02:03:53.640]   Or I'll do it.
[02:03:53.640 --> 02:03:54.640]   I'll wash it with you.
[02:03:54.640 --> 02:03:55.640]   We'll just sit together.
[02:03:55.640 --> 02:03:56.640]   We'll watch it.
[02:03:56.640 --> 02:03:57.640]   And then I'll go home.
[02:03:57.640 --> 02:04:00.040]   You can always get on-demand versions of all our shows, by the way.
[02:04:00.040 --> 02:04:04.840]   You don't have to be here live at twit.tv or wherever you subscribe to podcast.
[02:04:04.840 --> 02:04:08.880]   Don't forget our New Year's Eve special.
[02:04:08.880 --> 02:04:18.200]   I am going to be here at roughly 3.30 Pacific a.m. on New Year's Eve, 6.30 a.m. Eastern
[02:04:18.200 --> 02:04:19.200]   time.
[02:04:19.200 --> 02:04:21.720]   I don't even know what time that is in the UTC.
[02:04:21.720 --> 02:04:23.560]   It's crazy, crazy time.
[02:04:23.560 --> 02:04:24.560]   11 a.m.
[02:04:24.560 --> 02:04:28.080]   I'm going to be here at the UTC to do a 24-hour broadcast.
[02:04:28.080 --> 02:04:33.000]   We will go to every time zone in the world and countdown.
[02:04:33.000 --> 02:04:34.360]   And I'm hoping we'll talk to somebody.
[02:04:34.360 --> 02:04:35.440]   I think we have, you know what?
[02:04:35.440 --> 02:04:38.080]   There is a list of time zones we need.
[02:04:38.080 --> 02:04:48.840]   UTC plus 6, Russia, Yekaterinaberg time, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Xinjiang, China, Tibet,
[02:04:48.840 --> 02:04:50.160]   Bhutan, or Bangladesh.
[02:04:50.160 --> 02:04:53.680]   If you're in one of those nations, please go to twit.tv/nye.
[02:04:53.680 --> 02:05:00.000]   There are actually two time zones in Kazakhstan.
[02:05:00.000 --> 02:05:06.240]   Russia, Moscow time, Georgia, Armenia, United Arab Emirates, Dubai, Oman, Azerbaijan,
[02:05:06.240 --> 02:05:09.160]   Greenberg, and Iceland.
[02:05:09.160 --> 02:05:11.200]   I'm sorry, Greenland and icebergs.
[02:05:11.200 --> 02:05:14.320]   There's a place called icebergs.
[02:05:14.320 --> 02:05:16.880]   UTC minus 1.
[02:05:16.880 --> 02:05:18.200]   Possibly Brazil and Uruguay.
[02:05:18.200 --> 02:05:19.200]   We're not sure what the hell.
[02:05:19.200 --> 02:05:21.160]   They're at summertime or not.
[02:05:21.160 --> 02:05:22.160]   And Americans, Samoa.
[02:05:22.160 --> 02:05:25.480]   We'll go to twit.tv/nye and sign up.
[02:05:25.480 --> 02:05:26.800]   I'll fly over there and take care of it.
[02:05:26.800 --> 02:05:28.680]   Would you do Vladivostok for us?
[02:05:28.680 --> 02:05:30.360]   Actually, you have your choice.
[02:05:30.360 --> 02:05:34.240]   You could be in Vladivostok, Micronesia, New South Wales or...
[02:05:34.240 --> 02:05:35.880]   I know we have somebody in New South Wales.
[02:05:35.880 --> 02:05:36.880]   That's easy.
[02:05:36.880 --> 02:05:38.880]   That's easy.
[02:05:38.880 --> 02:05:40.520]   Anyway, so this isn't up today.
[02:05:40.520 --> 02:05:43.400]   I'll get a more up-to-date list for you.
[02:05:43.400 --> 02:05:44.600]   But it is going to be a lot of fun.
[02:05:44.600 --> 02:05:50.120]   Please enjoy that and enjoy responsibly, which means drinking heavily.
[02:05:50.120 --> 02:05:54.200]   Thank you everybody for joining us and we'll see you in 24...
[02:05:54.200 --> 02:05:57.680]   Well, no, not really 2014 because I'll be here in New Year's Eve.
[02:05:57.680 --> 02:05:59.240]   So we'll see you in New Year's Eve.
[02:05:59.240 --> 02:06:02.360]   It'll be 2014 in New Zealand.
[02:06:02.360 --> 02:06:03.360]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:06:03.360 --> 02:06:04.360]   Another Twit.

[02:06:05.360 --> 02:06:06.360]   This is amazing.
