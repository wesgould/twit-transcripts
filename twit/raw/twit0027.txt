[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   This is Twit, this weekend tech, episode 27 for the week of October 23rd, 2005.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   [Music]
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   I keep waiting for the applause. We're in front of you.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:42.000]   This shows you how much money we're spending on crew. Too much, apparently.
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   Let me introduce the Twit going around the table. Alex Lindsey from Pixel Core.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   Without him, we wouldn't have this fabulous big head video that we're doing here.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   Speaking of big heads, it's Patrick Norton of Digital Life TV.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   Do I have a big head? Because he couldn't be on screen with me.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   Would look like Tweedledee and Tweedledee.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Patrick's going great guns on DLTV. You're like number six on iTunes.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   I hope so.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   We're doing a name shift and going to two episodes a week in November.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   I don't know if there's going to be some angry people in the Twit world about that.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   You're not using three cameras, are you?
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   Yes, I am.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Actually, we're using four.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   But you don't have an excellent one?
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   We're going to be just seven. We can't afford Excel, too.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   We can't either.
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   John, but we got him. John C. Devorak, of course, from devorak.org/blog.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   We're doing a nice shirt today.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   Look who John Droggan with him.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Lawrence Lessig is here, Professor of Law at Stanford Law School,
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   founder for the Center for Internet and Society.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   It's great to have you.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   It's great to be here.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   And that President or Chairman or what do you call yourself, the Creative Commons?
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   Just Twit.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   The King Twitted Creative Commons. Without him, we wouldn't have a license.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   So thank you for that, Lawrence. It's great to have you here.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   And we missed an episode last week, so I thought we'd just briefly mention this.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   The old news now, but the video iPod is out, and I've got one here.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Should I open this up for a while? You've been bad enough.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   For about three days.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   What do you think?
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Well, you know, there's a lot of scratches on the stainless steel on the back.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   There's scratches on our iPod.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   How do you feel about class action lawsuits, Larry?
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   There is a class action lawsuit for scratches on the net.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   What's funny?
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   I had it in a riddle of this.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   What is it?
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   What is funny about this?
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   Hey, it's plastic.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   It scratches.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   It scratches things scratch.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Is it supposed to be scratch proof?
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   Are they selling it?
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Is thus?
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   I don't think so.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   No, yeah, well.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   The black ones are supposed to be worse than the...
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   The fit and finish doesn't look to be as good on this as some previous iPods.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Oh, look at what?
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   It's scratch.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   It's scratch.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Oh my God.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   I hate it.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   I think I spelled wrong.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Let's see.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   I have to say it's a beautiful device, isn't it?
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   I couldn't believe how much thinner it was.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   It's nice.
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   It's pretty device.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   It's very big.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   And one of the things that we're doing, and we've already started with the last episode,
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   but we're going to do it for more with this episode is producing the video of Twit for
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   this device.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   I mean, that's not the only device it'll play on, right?
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   Right.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   No, no, it'll play on a lot of things, but I'm pretty excited about this one.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   You know, I think that I have a PSP that I've been able to use a regular one.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   So there's a regular, right?
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   Compare the two.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   You'll see the...
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Yeah, actually it's a little thinner.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   That's the 30.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Now the 60's fatter, right?
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   Yeah, that is a 60.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Well, that's a 60, yeah.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   So, actually it looks the same with the big screen.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   And what are we doing code in MPEG-4?
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.380]   We can look into the
[00:03:20.380 --> 00:03:41.160]   Internet, not
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:48.160]   a little bit of a surprise.
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:49.160]   I like the clicker.
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:51.160]   There is something about all of that.
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:54.160]   You know, the cameras that make the digital fake.
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.160]   There's something about the...
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:00.160]   One of the reasons the success for this product, and I think the same reason that the Internet
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:05.160]   was successful in the Macintosh has done so well and introduced the mouse is that there is this...
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:08.160]   Any of this motion, there's an addictive mechanism involved here.
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.160]   Twiddling your thumb.
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:10.160]   Exactly.
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.160]   In fact, the same thing with the mouse.
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:15.160]   And you can talk to psychiatrists about this and there's an addictive mechanism.
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:16.160]   That's a...
[00:04:16.160 --> 00:04:17.160]   And you're going to see this, by the way.
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:18.160]   This is...
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:22.160]   You heard this here first on a phone coming out of Sweden called the Neo-Node.
[00:04:22.160 --> 00:04:23.160]   That's...
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:24.160]   You have a click wheel?
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:25.160]   It's totally thumbed.
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.160]   There's no dials or anything on it.
[00:04:26.160 --> 00:04:30.160]   The whole thing is a thumb motion and it's one of the most popular phones right now.
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:35.160]   And in parts of like Russia or any place, it's kind of a high-end phone that costs $450.
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.160]   But it has that same addictive quality and it's going to be huge in this country when it comes out.
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:42.160]   Yeah, this is not a bad form factor for a phone, actually, the new iPod for a video.
[00:04:42.160 --> 00:04:43.160]   I mean, that would be an OK phone.
[00:04:43.160 --> 00:04:45.160]   It would be like Steve Martin's moving up.
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.160]   Yeah, the trio.
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.160]   You know, both finger, you know, just with the phone phone.
[00:04:48.160 --> 00:04:49.160]   A fake it.
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.160]   Hello?
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:52.160]   We have the same phone.
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:53.160]   Same phone phone.
[00:04:53.160 --> 00:04:54.160]   Yeah, I guess so.
[00:04:54.160 --> 00:04:56.160]   It's thinner, it's lighter.
[00:04:56.160 --> 00:04:59.160]   It doesn't have a keyboard, but it is similar to the 650.
[00:04:59.160 --> 00:05:00.160]   Yeah.
[00:05:00.160 --> 00:05:03.160]   So this week's big story, or actually last week's big story was the iPod video.
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:04.160]   And I think that...
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.160]   Boy, it didn't take very long.
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:08.160]   You could get in stores on Thursday.
[00:05:08.160 --> 00:05:10.160]   There was porn available Thursday.
[00:05:10.160 --> 00:05:11.160]   Wednesday.
[00:05:11.160 --> 00:05:12.160]   Wednesday, probably, yeah.
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:13.160]   Yeah.
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:19.160]   Well, I mean, I think that what's interesting is how little the Hollywood has jumped in.
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:20.160]   You know what I mean?
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.160]   You know, by the way, it looks awesome.
[00:05:22.160 --> 00:05:23.160]   I couldn't believe how well it looked.
[00:05:23.160 --> 00:05:25.160]   Just going fullscreen on my laptop.
[00:05:25.160 --> 00:05:27.160]   But I mean, you know, downloading it, it zooms up really, really well.
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:28.160]   Did they pay you to watch it?
[00:05:28.160 --> 00:05:29.160]   They didn't pay me.
[00:05:29.160 --> 00:05:30.160]   I bought all of them.
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.160]   I mean, I had to be paid to watch a lot.
[00:05:32.160 --> 00:05:34.160]   Let me see if I have a book for you.
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:37.760]   I have to admit, I've been a little out of the loop, so I hadn't seen any four desperate
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:39.160]   housewives or I haven't seen any of those.
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:40.160]   Oh, please.
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:42.160]   Can't have watched these?
[00:05:42.160 --> 00:05:47.160]   I've watched television, but you know, you can only put up with so much of it.
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.160]   Interesting fact out of DC, the FBI crime report just came out.
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:58.160]   And juvenile violent crimes down, not only from last year and the year before, but overall,
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:00.160]   over the last 10 years, down 30% video games.
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:01.160]   Video games.
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.160]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:05.800]   But so that gives the light all the people who say that video games are teaching kids to
[00:06:05.800 --> 00:06:06.800]   be violent.
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:10.160]   The juvenile crime is down 30%.
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.160]   Sublimation.
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:14.160]   But they're much more violent to their computers than they are before.
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:16.160]   I go through mice when I run out of this.
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:17.160]   I mean, I think there is it.
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:21.160]   I have to say, if kids play Grand Theft Auto a lot, they get desensitized to violence.
[00:06:21.160 --> 00:06:22.160]   Do they really?
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:23.160]   I think they do.
[00:06:23.160 --> 00:06:25.160]   Because Henry's been running around with a Glock.
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:27.160]   No, but I'll give you an example.
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:30.160]   I was just up in Toronto and some guys ran over, you know.
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.160]   Those are Canadians.
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.160]   That's different, isn't it?
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:33.160]   Absolutely.
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.160]   A.
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.160]   I was in Toronto, some guys ran over a guy because they didn't give him directions.
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.160]   And they got in their car and they drove over the guy.
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:44.160]   And I think that if you play a lot of Grand Theft Auto, you think, oh yeah, you hit people,
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.160]   it's normal.
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:46.160]   Right?
[00:06:46.160 --> 00:06:47.160]   I'm not, this is not.
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.160]   This is thin, Leo.
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:49.160]   I'm not buying it.
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:50.160]   No, it's just logic.
[00:06:50.160 --> 00:06:55.160]   But of course, the facts are that it does, it has, something's reduced juvenile violence.
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:58.160]   People were shooting each other in LA and traffic, you know, a decade ago.
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.160]   And this is not new behavior.
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:21.160]   This is not
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:28.160]   new behavior.
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:29.160]   I think it's bad.
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:30.160]   This has been normalized.
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:31.160]   Otherwise, it's meaningless.
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:32.160]   I don't know.
[00:07:32.160 --> 00:07:33.160]   I think that's a very interesting thing.
[00:07:33.160 --> 00:07:38.160]   You know, I always say my kids play Grand Theft Auto, you know, and I let them play, you know, the whole thing.
[00:07:38.160 --> 00:07:43.160]   And my comment is, you know, I think you have to be a violent person to go out and be violent in the real world.
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:47.160]   But, you know, they say, well, this is like a simulation and I'm, the only thing I have to say if like all hell breaks loose in my children have to become auto thieves, they will be very good at it.
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:51.160]   So they will, they will have protected them from getting in trouble.
[00:07:51.160 --> 00:07:53.160]   Do you play any video games where I don't?
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.160]   I don't.
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:55.160]   Sorry.
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:07:56.160]   He's too busy probably to play video games.
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:57.160]   He's traveling all the time.
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:07:58.160]   He's never around.
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:07:59.160]   I'm surprised he's here.
[00:07:59.160 --> 00:08:00.160]   He's not here.
[00:08:00.160 --> 00:08:01.160]   Where are you going to be next week?
[00:08:01.160 --> 00:08:02.160]   Slovenia.
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.160]   Really?
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.160]   Have you been to Slovenia before?
[00:08:04.160 --> 00:08:05.160]   No.
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.160]   Oh, you'll love it.
[00:08:06.160 --> 00:08:08.160]   So here, it's supposed to be a whole man.
[00:08:08.160 --> 00:08:09.160]   It's terrific.
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:11.160]   Welcome back to travel talk.
[00:08:11.160 --> 00:08:14.160]   Slovenia is terrific.
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.160]   Believe me.
[00:08:15.160 --> 00:08:16.160]   I'm beyond as unbelievable.
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:20.160]   But, Larry, you have a kind of a passion for, I know the Eastern Europe.
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:22.160]   It's been a lot of time there, but I never was in Slovenia.
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.160]   I'm surprised you never, never gotten there.
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.160]   Are they working on a constitution or?
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:28.160]   No, but they're launching Creative Commons licenses next week.
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.160]   I want to talk about Creative Commons.
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:37.160]   You're doing, I have to say, I put point people to the Creative Commons site because you're doing what I'm thrilled to see kind of a history of Creative Commons.
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:38.160]   Right.
[00:08:38.160 --> 00:08:42.160]   And really talking about how it happened and what is Creative Commons?
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:45.160]   So it's a really simple basic idea.
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:59.160]   Give artists and authors a simple way to say the freedoms that they want to run with their content so that there's no ambiguity, there's no need to call a lawyer, you know what you can do, and you make it easy for other people to do stuff with it.
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:01.160]   What's wrong with the current copyright law?
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.160]   Why don't they just use that?
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:07.160]   Well, the problem is that the credit copyright law, by default, says all rights are reserved.
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:14.160]   And whenever you use any creative copyrighted material, automatically the law says you've got a clear permission first.
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:18.160]   Now, of course, most people don't worry about that and most people do whatever the hell they want.
[00:09:18.160 --> 00:09:19.160]   Allegedly.
[00:09:19.160 --> 00:09:20.160]   Allegedly could be.
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:29.160]   But the problem is that we're moving into a world five years from now where technology will lock down the content so you can only do precisely what you've gotten permission to do.
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:30.160]   Right.
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:40.160]   The thing that we're really afraid of is that when that world happens, we will have destroyed the potential of this technology to be used for all sorts of other fantastic creative stuff.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:48.160]   So what we want to do is to build a kind of buttress of support for the expression of freedom running with content and that's what the licenses do.
[00:09:48.160 --> 00:09:51.160]   They basically say, "Use it in this way."
[00:09:51.160 --> 00:09:56.160]   And if you use it in that way, it's consistent with the license that you guarantee to continue to make the stuff available.
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:10:00.160]   John, you wrote in an article in July that Creative Commons was humbugged.
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:01.160]   Did I use that word?
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:02.160]   Yeah, that's right here.
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.160]   It's a title.
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:05.160]   Oh, well, you know, the copy of it, or speak to those titles.
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:06.160]   What's your complaint?
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:09.160]   Well, I thought that, you know, I'm well protected now.
[00:10:09.160 --> 00:10:10.160]   What do I need to all this other stuff?
[00:10:10.160 --> 00:10:23.160]   Well, Larry pointed something out to me recently, which I have to say is kind of distressing, which is that, and you might want to explain this, which is why I can't go on my website and declare something to be in the public domain, which I always wanted to...
[00:10:23.160 --> 00:10:24.160]   You could.
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:25.160]   Well, there you go.
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:32.160]   Now, tell us why this isn't... and this is like really changes my attitude about things because if you can't... if I can't say, "Hey, look, you guys can give you all rights."
[00:10:32.160 --> 00:10:33.160]   I give all rights, go steal it.
[00:10:33.160 --> 00:10:34.160]   Take it.
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:38.160]   It's yours, free, you know, because I've right-do, you know, Photoshop things or I write stuff that I don't care about.
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:39.160]   I've written software and done that.
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.160]   I've done that for you.
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.160]   Right.
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:42.160]   Well, what's the problem?
[00:10:42.160 --> 00:10:46.160]   Well, the point is, before 1976, there was essentially a thousand ways you could do that.
[00:10:46.160 --> 00:10:49.160]   But after 1976, the law changed and said copyright was automatic.
[00:10:49.160 --> 00:10:52.160]   And then give us the history about the 1976 legislation.
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:54.160]   Is it having to do with Disney?
[00:10:54.160 --> 00:10:57.160]   Doesn't everything have something to do with Disney?
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:04.160]   Does '76, not so much about Disney, but the fact is before '76, copyright was what you could think of as an opt-in system.
[00:11:04.160 --> 00:11:06.160]   You had to raise your hand and say, "I want protection."
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.160]   And a very small proportion of creative work had that kind of protection.
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:12.160]   The protection was already reserved, made total sense.
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:14.160]   After '76, they changed the law.
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:16.160]   So by default, everything is automatically protected, right?
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:18.160]   You don't have to really do anything.
[00:11:18.160 --> 00:11:19.160]   You don't have to do anything.
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.160]   You don't have to put a C in a 1970s.
[00:11:21.160 --> 00:11:22.160]   You don't have to do copyright.
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:23.160]   You don't have to do anything.
[00:11:23.160 --> 00:11:24.160]   You don't have to put a date or anything.
[00:11:24.160 --> 00:11:26.160]   And then it's automatically protected.
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:32.160]   Now for a term of life of the author plus 70 or for corporate works 95 years, that has everything to do with Disney.
[00:11:32.160 --> 00:11:33.160]   It's a long time.
[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:36.160]   So if I lived to 80, it's 150 years of copyright.
[00:11:36.160 --> 00:11:37.160]   That's exactly right.
[00:11:37.160 --> 00:11:38.160]   Automatically.
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:39.160]   Automatically.
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:40.160]   Hey, it's a bonanza for the copyright owners.
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:41.160]   But wait a minute.
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:42.160]   I wanted to be made.
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:44.160]   Why can't I say I assert no rights?
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:48.160]   Well, the problem is that when you give a gift, that would be a gift.
[00:11:48.160 --> 00:11:51.160]   Like, you know, Dvorak's work wouldn't be a gift, but yours would be a gift.
[00:11:51.160 --> 00:11:52.160]   Hey, over to the public.
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:55.160]   And when you give a gift like that, you're going to tangibly deliver it.
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:56.160]   That's what the law says.
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:58.160]   Well, how do you tangibly deliver a copyright, right?
[00:11:58.160 --> 00:12:00.160]   It's just an intangible thing.
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:01.160]   I couldn't write a letter and say, "Here's the letter."
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:05.160]   So we have a routine at Creative Commons where you can put stuff in the public domain.
[00:12:05.160 --> 00:12:10.160]   Basically, you know, take a rubber chicken, shake it over your head, spin around six times, scream public domain.
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:11.160]   And that's enough.
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:12.160]   It's fun all maybe.
[00:12:12.160 --> 00:12:14.160]   We're not sure whether that actually works.
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:16.160]   But the point is there's no easy way to do it.
[00:12:16.160 --> 00:12:18.160]   But the other thing is, can you talk about it?
[00:12:18.160 --> 00:12:19.160]   We are, if you ask me.
[00:12:19.160 --> 00:12:22.160]   So as nobody said that the Creative Commons is legal and effective then.
[00:12:22.160 --> 00:12:26.160]   Well, Creative Commons licenses don't put things in the public domain.
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:28.160]   So that's how they're different.
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:31.160]   So what you're basically doing is you're saying you have to do a couple things.
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:34.160]   The minimum is give me attribution.
[00:12:34.160 --> 00:12:39.160]   And the maximum is, for example, can't use it for commercial work, have to release it in a share-alike kind of--
[00:12:39.160 --> 00:12:41.160]   That's our comp-- or license on this.
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:43.160]   It's this non-commercial share-alike.
[00:12:43.160 --> 00:12:48.160]   What if you want to say, without, like, say all of that, say, you know, I don't care?
[00:12:48.160 --> 00:12:51.160]   You can not-- you can say you wrote it.
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:53.160]   You can do-- you can sell it commercially.
[00:12:53.160 --> 00:12:54.160]   I don't care.
[00:12:54.160 --> 00:12:55.160]   Is that part of the creative--
[00:12:55.160 --> 00:12:56.160]   That's public domain.
[00:12:56.160 --> 00:12:58.160]   And we have a routine to try to put something into the public domain.
[00:12:58.160 --> 00:13:02.160]   And it takes a couple formal steps and you have to go through a document.
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:03.160]   So it's a painful process.
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:04.160]   It's a painful process.
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:05.160]   Because they made it so simple.
[00:13:05.160 --> 00:13:06.160]   So, 976.
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:10.160]   Well, I mean, that was the idea was to protect, you know, you know, the copyright.
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:14.160]   You know, I would-- I almost said made the mistake of saying that's to protect authors and create--
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.160]   And creative types.
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:21.160]   But in fact, we all know this was to done-- done to-- to protect the copyright owners.
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:26.160]   And many times, and most writers know this, is that most publications now try to steal all your writers when you--
[00:13:26.160 --> 00:13:28.160]   They won't even buy-- buy that.
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.160]   We won't give anything to the audience.
[00:13:29.160 --> 00:13:34.160]   It's almost impossible for writers to get, you know, all their rights and, you know, just sell the first North American.
[00:13:34.160 --> 00:13:37.160]   They sell-- well, you know, we buy everything--
[00:13:37.160 --> 00:13:42.160]   Magazines, actually books, you can-- you can hold on to them.
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:44.160]   Now, even with most books you can't.
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:45.160]   But with magazines--
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:46.160]   Magazines, things like that.
[00:13:46.160 --> 00:13:50.160]   I've been offered my rights twice in 10 years with magazines.
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:55.160]   Well, I always insist on mine and most people read my stuff like you say and they say, "What's it worth?"
[00:13:55.160 --> 00:13:56.160]   You know, so they give it to me.
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:03.160]   So-- but generally-- and I also have a long history of like demanding at least shared copyright.
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:04.160]   So it's like copyright by both.
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.160]   So at least I can give permissions that nobody cares about it.
[00:14:06.160 --> 00:14:10.160]   And it's, you know, because a lot of people will say, "Hey, can I reprint this or that?"
[00:14:10.160 --> 00:14:15.160]   And I'll say, "Yeah, but you have to put reprinted by permission of author and copyright, you know, whatever."
[00:14:15.160 --> 00:14:17.160]   Even though apparently you don't even do that.
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:18.160]   But--
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:19.160]   So I--
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:24.160]   Generally speaking, the copyright-- these big corporations that just bought up all these copyrights and they're just a scam.
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:27.160]   Well, I mean, when I was young and ignorant, I thought, "Oh, that's cool.
[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:29.160]   I just have to publish something and it's automatically copyright.
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:30.160]   I'm protected."
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.160]   And I mean, that's not a bad thing.
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:33.160]   And you were--
[00:14:33.160 --> 00:14:34.160]   It's--
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:35.160]   And I was.
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:39.160]   It's-- I guess what's bad is I thought I was giving other stuff away and I wasn't.
[00:14:39.160 --> 00:14:40.160]   You weren't.
[00:14:40.160 --> 00:14:41.160]   And I don't think it was bad.
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:44.160]   I don't think the system in 1976 was bad before the internet.
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:50.160]   The problem is you come to the world of the internet and everybody has these assumptions about how they intend people to be able to use their work.
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.160]   And now they can insist on it.
[00:14:52.160 --> 00:14:53.160]   Now they can force it.
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:54.160]   Right.
[00:14:54.160 --> 00:14:59.160]   But the law says that those assumptions don't mean anything until they're expressed in some formal way.
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:04.160]   But what we're trying to do is to make it easy for people to express the kind of freedoms they think ought to run with their content.
[00:15:04.160 --> 00:15:09.160]   Now, I know if we ever take this video or the audio, we won't ever do it with the audio.
[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:13.160]   We're never going to-- it's always going to be that licensed that way and we'll always have it unprotected.
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:20.160]   But a video might well-- for instance, if we were able to sell it on the Apple Store, they might say, "You've got to use our DRM or Audible might say you've got to use our DRM."
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:24.160]   Why would Apple care whether we use their DRM to protect our content?
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:25.160]   I don't know.
[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:26.160]   Audible would.
[00:15:26.160 --> 00:15:28.160]   I already-- you know, I know for a fact that--
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.160]   I don't get--
[00:15:29.160 --> 00:15:30.160]   I guess that's just how they're system-war.
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:31.160]   It's probably targeted in their mechanism.
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.160]   That's their pain that's probably right.
[00:15:33.160 --> 00:15:34.160]   And I'll tell you why Apple is.
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.160]   Because they get a percentage, a large percentage.
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:38.160]   So they now suddenly are rights holders.
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.160]   They want-- they have an interest in it.
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:42.160]   So that kind of screws everything up.
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:48.160]   And I think that one of the things that I like about some of the newer stuff with Creative Commons is also the time thing.
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:56.160]   Because, you know, shortening the time frame to 14 years or you can extend it-- because even that's longer than with a lot of the stuff that I create,
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:16:01.160]   you know, I'm really interested in having a lot of rights for the first five years.
[00:16:01.160 --> 00:16:02.160]   You know, maybe 10 years.
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:07.160]   14 years is-- most of the stuff that we're doing now is like, "How about 150 years?"
[00:16:07.160 --> 00:16:13.160]   But I don't think it's-- I'd be happy to like, you know, I'd love to have a cascade where I go, you know, I want all the rights for the first two years.
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:17.160]   I want some of these rights for the next five years and I want no rights after that.
[00:16:17.160 --> 00:16:20.160]   You know, those are the kind of things that I-- you know, because you want to be able to extend it.
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:25.160]   And I think that most of us, I know for, you know, I have a company that makes products, you know, and--
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:27.160]   90% of our revenue comes in the first.
[00:16:27.160 --> 00:16:33.160]   Yeah, but you could always be the cash cow that's just, you know, is one of the Mickey Mouse character that, you know, you're going to--
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.160]   It's in a new idea.
[00:16:35.160 --> 00:16:39.160]   Yeah, but I'm not sure if it's even-- if that's even reasonable.
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:40.160]   No, for you, maybe.
[00:16:40.160 --> 00:16:41.160]   No, no, but I mean, I--
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:42.160]   But Disney used--
[00:16:42.160 --> 00:16:43.160]   No, it's not reasonable.
[00:16:43.160 --> 00:16:45.160]   It's a complete, ridiculous situation.
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:47.160]   I get that it makes a lot of money.
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:51.160]   A lot of things-- the thing that's been ignored here is the cultural implications and the reason--
[00:16:51.160 --> 00:16:52.160]   Right.
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:58.160]   And the reason that copyright is, you know, was set up in a certain way to allow stuff to drop into the public domain after just a very few years,
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:02.160]   26 and whatever, and with a renewal, maybe, is that it had cultural implications.
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:09.160]   Public domain is the thing that people aren't noticing is that because, you know, works of art, oil paintings, for example,
[00:17:09.160 --> 00:17:13.160]   we are still stuck, essentially, in the impressionist era.
[00:17:13.160 --> 00:17:14.160]   Because all, like, for--
[00:17:14.160 --> 00:17:15.160]   That sense has been in the public domain.
[00:17:15.160 --> 00:17:17.160]   You can't get Picasso on the public domain.
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:18.160]   It has to be lysis.
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:26.160]   So essentially, the entire mechanism for improving, you know, our condition based on art is frozen in time, about 1910.
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:31.160]   Yeah, and this is, again, much worse because of the implication with digital technology.
[00:17:31.160 --> 00:17:36.160]   So take music, right, remix of music, the kind of extension of hip hop, the context of mashups.
[00:17:36.160 --> 00:17:37.160]   Mashups.
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:38.160]   Right.
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:43.160]   Courts have held that there is no fair use right at all to sample music.
[00:17:43.160 --> 00:17:44.160]   Right?
[00:17:44.160 --> 00:17:49.160]   So you can't take one second out of a recording without clearing the rights up front.
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:50.160]   Right?
[00:17:50.160 --> 00:17:54.160]   So we've got billion machines out there for making music, but the only way to do it legally through this mashup
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:58.160]   or remixing type technology is to hire a lawyer who's going to clear all the rights from this.
[00:17:58.160 --> 00:17:59.160]   Or use legal samples.
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:04.160]   I mean, there have been cases where artists have released samples on CDs that you could buy, and as long as you attributed them,
[00:18:04.160 --> 00:18:06.160]   I mean, the guys from the punk did that.
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:07.160]   Right.
[00:18:07.160 --> 00:18:11.160]   So there's a beginning of that in a commercial context, and Creative Commons is pushing it in this more general non-commercial--
[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:13.160]   There's a lot of creative comments music now.
[00:18:13.160 --> 00:18:14.160]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:21.160]   But the point is the idea that just as the technology, it makes it so anybody can be part, can be a composer in a certain sense.
[00:18:21.160 --> 00:18:26.160]   The law comes in and pulls this away is crazy, and especially because of this, I think John's point is exactly right.
[00:18:26.160 --> 00:18:27.160]   The way it implicates culture.
[00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:32.160]   I mean, the only people who can legally produce are people who can afford lawyers that stand next to them.
[00:18:32.160 --> 00:18:36.160]   And that's exactly what you don't want in the era where digital technology lets everybody be a creator.
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:37.160]   That's exactly what we tell them.
[00:18:37.160 --> 00:18:39.160]   Okay, let's take a step back.
[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:51.160]   I mean, the idea of creation is noble, but how much of this is about creation is how much of this is about an entire generation of people who basically between, you know, bit torn and going back to going back to the abstract.
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:54.160]   And they have to say that they really don't ever have to pay for any content again.
[00:18:54.160 --> 00:18:56.160]   I mean, is that a legitimate choice?
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:18:59.160]   I mean, I realize that we're watching the dinosauring of an entire publishing system.
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.160]   No, it's a great point.
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:05.160]   I don't support the idea of people taking other people's content without permission.
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:14.160]   I don't, you know, if I thought this battle was about whether you could listen to Britney Spears for free, I'd be on the other side because I don't think you should listen to Britney Spears at any time.
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:16.160]   So it's not about getting content from you.
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:20.160]   They also tried to rip the impressionist paintings off the walls because they were so disturbing.
[00:19:20.160 --> 00:19:25.160]   I mean, not that I think in 50 years we're going to look back and think that this was a life-changing point in music.
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:32.160]   But that happening with kids in technology, but in addition to that, there's extraordinary, there's extraordinary creativity.
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:33.160]   Do you know about the AMV culture?
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:34.160]   This is fascinating.
[00:19:34.160 --> 00:19:36.160]   There's this thing called "Anime Music Video."
[00:19:36.160 --> 00:19:37.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:46.160]   100,000 kids, mainly Americans, who record all of the anime series that they can, and then they re-edited setting it to music or setting it to video trailers.
[00:19:46.160 --> 00:19:55.160]   And so they have these extraordinary productions all, you know, made on their old iMacs up in their bedrooms that are extraordinarily creative, but it's all taken and found work.
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:56.160]   They can do it.
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:57.160]   And it's legal. It's not legal at all.
[00:19:57.160 --> 00:20:01.160]   Look at the great halo. What is it called? Red... Red... What is it?
[00:20:01.160 --> 00:20:02.160]   Red versus blue.
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:03.160]   Red versus blue.
[00:20:03.160 --> 00:20:04.160]   Yeah, I love that.
[00:20:04.160 --> 00:20:09.160]   They take halo footage from the game and they put dialogue behind it.
[00:20:09.160 --> 00:20:13.160]   That's a wonderful creative thing. And I think mashups too are great.
[00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:14.160]   It's like what's up Tiger Lily.
[00:20:14.160 --> 00:20:15.160]   What's up? Exactly.
[00:20:15.160 --> 00:20:18.160]   Which was pre-1976. So I guess you could...
[00:20:18.160 --> 00:20:24.160]   So the real issue is, I think, Patrick, is that you're in a way undermining an artist's right to make money.
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:32.160]   You're undermining copyright because if you prevent any kind of fair use, you're just creating a whole generation of people who says, "Well screw it."
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:40.160]   Well, I think that that's the thing. I mean, a lot of times when you make more laws, you make more criminals out of nothing.
[00:20:40.160 --> 00:20:49.160]   And the issue is that there's a lot of statistics that will say, "Someone who smokes marijuana will then move on to harder drugs."
[00:20:49.160 --> 00:20:58.160]   And a lot of people argue that the reason they move on to harder drugs is because they've been pushed into an illicit area, not because marijuana itself is the leader to that.
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:21:02.160]   And in the same way, we're going, "Everything is illegal no matter how you touch it."
[00:21:02.160 --> 00:21:06.160]   So from the time I was 10 years old, we were recording our friends' albums and making mixes.
[00:21:06.160 --> 00:21:10.160]   We'd all get together and make mix tapes and stuff like that. All of that was illegal.
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:11.160]   So the thing...
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:13.160]   No, actually that was clear, but now it's not.
[00:21:13.160 --> 00:21:16.160]   But now they're talking about, "If I want to move on to non-vide..."
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:17.160]   Can't do it in digital context.
[00:21:17.160 --> 00:21:19.160]   If you can't get only an analog, not digital.
[00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:22.160]   And so the thing is, is that what we're doing is creating a lot of people.
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:23.160]   If we made it easy.
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:31.160]   If we bring the... Even 99 cents, there's a mechanism issue with making it any less than that, and mostly related to Visa.
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:40.160]   So they can't get much lower than that, but if you made it 25 cents or 40 cents per song, it would just be too much trouble to go get it somehow.
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:41.160]   I agree with that.
[00:21:41.160 --> 00:21:42.160]   But that always believed this.
[00:21:42.160 --> 00:21:47.160]   And the rest of what you're saying is you're talking about the Sovietization of the American culture.
[00:21:47.160 --> 00:21:48.160]   That's exactly right.
[00:21:48.160 --> 00:21:52.160]   Essentially, like my first time I went to Russia, I always got the biggest kick out of this.
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:56.160]   They told you you couldn't carry Russian... This is during the... When they were so communist.
[00:21:56.160 --> 00:22:00.160]   You couldn't have Russian currency outside the Russian border.
[00:22:00.160 --> 00:22:01.160]   And outside the Russian border included...
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:04.160]   You can't live on less than 25, whatever the word...
[00:22:04.160 --> 00:22:08.160]   The joke of it was you can't have the currency outside and the border actually began it when you ended the airport.
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:10.160]   There's actually a line where you were out.
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:11.160]   Give us your money.
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:12.160]   No, you were at a point.
[00:22:12.160 --> 00:22:16.160]   But the thing is to get inside to the terminal, which was essentially where you were,
[00:22:16.160 --> 00:22:19.160]   were essentially outside the country. You couldn't legally have Russian currency.
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:23.160]   All the carts that you pushed around that cost like a couple of rubles were outside.
[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:26.160]   So you had to have currency outside to use a cart.
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:29.160]   And it was like, so you had to break the law immediately.
[00:22:29.160 --> 00:22:34.160]   And the Russian system, which I think is what is happening here, is making everybody a criminal.
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:36.160]   So you can just, at any given point, just pick up anybody.
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:37.160]   You pick up you.
[00:22:37.160 --> 00:22:38.160]   You've got it.
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:39.160]   You committed it.
[00:22:39.160 --> 00:22:41.160]   I debated Hillary Rosen down at USC.
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:43.160]   And I was laying this out.
[00:22:43.160 --> 00:22:44.160]   I was saying basically anything you do.
[00:22:44.160 --> 00:22:45.160]   Former head of the...
[00:22:45.160 --> 00:22:46.160]   I had a double A.
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:48.160]   And she said, that's right.
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:53.160]   Basically, everybody's always violating the law, but you should trust us to be suing the people who ought to be sued.
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.160]   When they say trust us...
[00:22:55.160 --> 00:22:59.160]   When I had exactly a sense of it, what John said, this is the Sovietization of American culture.
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:03.160]   We have this extraordinarily creative class that lives in the black market, right?
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:04.160]   They're black market creators.
[00:23:04.160 --> 00:23:05.160]   And it's happening.
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:06.160]   And that's the point you haven't shown this down.
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:07.160]   And you've done this to us.
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:08.160]   They were incredibly intelligent.
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:12.160]   They were really entrepreneurs, but they all lived in the black market.
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:17.160]   And I say, why the hell in a democracy should we have something like the black market living like that?
[00:23:17.160 --> 00:23:20.160]   Like if the system is bad, we should be changing it.
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:22.160]   But that's of course not happening.
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:24.160]   And the funny thing is it would probably make it better.
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:28.160]   I have kind of an opinion now that if I see it on iTunes, people should be buying it.
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:31.160]   If I don't see it on iTunes, people should be stealing it.
[00:23:31.160 --> 00:23:32.160]   Taking it for a word that they can find it.
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:33.160]   It's their own problem if they're not putting it.
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:37.160]   This brings us back to the Napster thing, which people just want to deny.
[00:23:37.160 --> 00:23:41.160]   I mean, this is why I think the Sovietization thing is so important to understand because it's the only thing that's happening.
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:46.160]   Because all the evidence is against this working to the benefit of the capitalist.
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:51.160]   For example, and I'm not saying in terms of like I'm a Marxist or anything, but for example, when Napster was at its age...
[00:23:51.160 --> 00:23:53.160]   Watch out because Larry was a conservative too at one time.
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:56.160]   You're sitting next to him, it could be a problem.
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:24:02.160]   So anyway, when Napster was at its most popular, CD sales were on the rise.
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:07.160]   And when Napster was cut off, those sales dropped like a rock and they do not want to face this fact.
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:13.160]   And part of it was, is because when you were on Napster, you would go to somebody else's library and see a whole other cool stuff.
[00:24:13.160 --> 00:24:14.160]   And you'd be like, "Oh, but..."
[00:24:14.160 --> 00:24:20.160]   And you could find stuff that wasn't... and all that kind of that age, that discovery that created more sales.
[00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:22.160]   It was one of the greatest mechanisms ever.
[00:24:22.160 --> 00:24:26.160]   That part of it, there was the main thing, which is that I could see this guy has my taste.
[00:24:26.160 --> 00:24:31.160]   I could tell because he's got this... but then he's got this unusual tune on here and I'm thinking, "I never heard of these guys."
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:34.160]   You click on it, boom, it was like, "Wow, these guys are great."
[00:24:34.160 --> 00:24:40.160]   So in the long run, who cares? I mean, eventually this whole edifice is going to crumble and fall, yes?
[00:24:40.160 --> 00:24:41.160]   No.
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:42.160]   Why do you think that?
[00:24:42.160 --> 00:24:47.160]   Because you have a massive underground growing all the time of people who are ignoring copyright law.
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:52.160]   Well, something's going to grow. And I train lawyers for a living, right?
[00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:56.160]   And so you stand in front of a class and you try to tell them why they're supposed to follow legal ethics.
[00:24:56.160 --> 00:25:01.160]   And they think about the last 10 years of their life where they've done nothing but break the law every single day of their life.
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.160]   We pay a price for that, for sure.
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:05.160]   Yeah, of course. It's a corrosive effect on society.
[00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:09.160]   This is the one thing that Jack Valenti, former head of the MPAA,
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:14.160]   and I agree about this. It's awful that you raise a generation of kids breaking the law, but his response is,
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:18.160]   "Let's find a more effective way to wage war against the enemy."
[00:25:18.160 --> 00:25:22.160]   And my response is, "Let's find a better law so that normal behavior isn't criminal."
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:30.160]   Well, I think that when they create these rules, and if they were... I mean, I personally sometimes think that I hope that they are able to fully enforce the law,
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:35.160]   fully enforce everything that they're talking about, because it will create a gap that a lot of other people can move in on.
[00:25:35.160 --> 00:25:40.160]   Because if it becomes so hard to use that music, if it becomes so hard because of all the DRM,
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:46.160]   other people that are using, for instance, stuff like MySpace, you know, and these bands are selling half a million albums
[00:25:46.160 --> 00:25:52.160]   with no record company. And as Apple gets bigger and bigger with iTunes,
[00:25:52.160 --> 00:25:59.160]   and as, for instance, this video iPod, it's going to take a couple years probably to figure out the SAG versus the SAG
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:01.160]   versus the Director's Guild versus the...
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:01.160]   Oh, there are these... No, that's the whole issue. They're already going, "Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:31.160]   No, that's the whole issue. They're already going, "Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:36.160]   Because for so many years, they got ripped off on the DVD after they did a movie.
[00:26:36.160 --> 00:26:42.160]   The DVDs were not considered like toys. I mean, they weren't given their full percentages off of those sales of DVDs,
[00:26:42.160 --> 00:26:49.160]   and as Hollywood shifted toward the DVD as its really primary source of income, these guys were screwed out of all the money.
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:51.160]   And now, of course, they're changing those contracts.
[00:26:51.160 --> 00:26:56.160]   I was telling you, they were screwed. They only got paid $20 million for the film, and they didn't get another penny after that.
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:27:00.160]   I mean, it's funny if you don't make the 20 mil.
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:02.160]   No, there are, but they're still doing okay.
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:05.160]   Yeah, no, I'm so... I'm so... so bad for these people.
[00:27:05.160 --> 00:27:08.160]   You know, so they made 200,000. They were only in the top half of the time.
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:10.160]   Yeah, I know, but they just saw this money going down the drain.
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:14.160]   Can we compare this to software? Is there an analogy in free software?
[00:27:14.160 --> 00:27:18.160]   I know you're a big proponent of free software and always happen, Larry.
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:22.160]   Is there an analogy here? I mean, is proprietary software...?
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:25.160]   Created Creative Commons stealing the idea of the free software movement, right?
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:35.160]   So, free software gave away copyright licenses to make it clear that software would remain in a space where people could build on it without fearing it for prioritization.
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:39.160]   What we've done is different from free software, because free software has basically...
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:47.160]   the free software movement has basically one core license, the GPL, which is copy-lefted, and Creative Commons has six licenses arranged.
[00:27:47.160 --> 00:27:51.160]   But it's the same in tuition. It's a little bit different, though, because, you know, when they started free software,
[00:27:51.160 --> 00:27:57.160]   they started it because the culture was increasingly producing proprietary software, and that was something new.
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:03.160]   But there's always been proprietary culture. It's not like, you know, we began having record companies five years ago.
[00:28:03.160 --> 00:28:08.160]   There's always been proprietary culture. But the difference is, before the Internet, I think it was more balanced, right?
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:12.160]   There's lots of ways to use culture that wasn't regulated by copyright law. You read a book.
[00:28:12.160 --> 00:28:17.160]   That's not a fair use of the book. It's a free use of the book. There's no copyright implication there at all.
[00:28:17.160 --> 00:28:24.160]   But you do the same thing on a digital network. It necessarily produces a copy. It necessarily triggers copyright law.
[00:28:24.160 --> 00:28:29.160]   So there's nothing you can do in the digital world that doesn't trigger copyright law in some sense.
[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:36.160]   So the proprietary nature of culture in the digital world is more controlling than it was in the analog.
[00:28:36.160 --> 00:28:41.160]   What do we do? I mean, is there an action that we as citizens need to take?
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:44.160]   Should we write our members of Congress?
[00:28:44.160 --> 00:28:47.160]   Well, first you should write John and tell him his article about creative commons was wrong.
[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:49.160]   I think he was attracted to that.
[00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:55.160]   No, I never said that my column was never wrong. My column was questioning like, "No, no, it wasn't either."
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:59.160]   I was saying, "I don't get it." Somebody explained it. No. I was saying, "I don't get it."
[00:28:59.160 --> 00:29:03.160]   Well, somebody explained it to me, "Please." And yeah, he explained it. I finally got my explanation.
[00:29:03.160 --> 00:29:06.160]   Sometimes you've got to go public. You can write another one.
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:09.160]   Yeah. It's doing fine. I don't need my help.
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:13.160]   But the point is that sometimes you've got to go public with bafflement, which I do.
[00:29:13.160 --> 00:29:14.160]   Which is appropriate.
[00:29:14.160 --> 00:29:16.160]   Yeah. I'm saying, "Hey, I don't get it."
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:17.160]   If you don't, many others don't.
[00:29:17.160 --> 00:29:22.160]   He noticed a lot of people that responded to that column, some PCMag.com, by the way.
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:30.160]   That column, they didn't get it either, but they were just giving me crap because I said something bad about me.
[00:29:30.160 --> 00:29:31.160]   Holy crap.
[00:29:31.160 --> 00:29:34.160]   It was like some hero amongst a bunch of nerds and geeks.
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:37.160]   Well, that was my reaction, frankly. I couldn't believe it.
[00:29:37.160 --> 00:29:43.160]   I think that one of the things that I think is most important, because we do a lot of work in Africa.
[00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:45.160]   We have a lot of members in Africa.
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:48.160]   So the developing nation's license, I think, is important.
[00:29:48.160 --> 00:29:54.160]   I know we sell our software that we create at 10% of what we sell in the rest of the world.
[00:29:54.160 --> 00:29:57.160]   Because that is something that I don't want to talk about.
[00:29:57.160 --> 00:29:59.160]   Talk a little bit about that, Larry.
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:02.160]   Corey Doctor was also using that for his latest book, "The Third World License."
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:03.160]   I'm sorry.
[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:04.160]   Developing nation's license, right?
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:05.160]   Talk about that.
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:09.160]   The basic idea here was that if you could put something on a developing nation's license,
[00:30:09.160 --> 00:30:12.160]   and that means in a developing nation, you can do whatever you want with this.
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:15.160]   Outside of the developing nation's ordinary rules apply.
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:21.160]   We started this because we were asked by Jamie Love, who's a big activist in this area, to build this license.
[00:30:21.160 --> 00:30:22.160]   So we did.
[00:30:22.160 --> 00:30:28.160]   But the thing that was coolest that surprised me about it was there's a bunch of architects who were designing low-cost housing.
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:34.160]   They've stamped all of their designs with Creative Commons developing nation's licenses,
[00:30:34.160 --> 00:30:37.160]   and people in developing nations can take these designs, do whatever the hell they want with them.
[00:30:37.160 --> 00:30:41.160]   But outside of the developing world, you've got to deal with them in the ordinary copyright way.
[00:30:41.160 --> 00:30:47.160]   So it's just trying to facilitate spread into markets where it wouldn't spread otherwise,
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:50.160]   and you don't want to call somebody a pirate because they're building on your ideas in those markets.
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:52.160]   And so you're doing that with your software?
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:53.160]   Corey's doing that with his book.
[00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:55.160]   Well, with the PIXACOR, we have a membership that people pay for.
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:59.160]   And if you're from Africa specifically, you don't pay, there's no membership fee.
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:01.160]   So that's how we'll deal with it.
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:06.160]   That's exactly the same license of that process because it doesn't make any sense.
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:09.160]   I mean, our membership per year costs $420 a year.
[00:31:09.160 --> 00:31:14.160]   That represents four months of work for the average person that's in Zimbabwe,
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:15.160]   which is where we have a lot of members.
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:17.160]   If they have a job.
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:22.160]   If they have a job, it doesn't make any sense in a whole lot of ways.
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:27.160]   If I want to expand, if I want to create opportunity there, for good business opportunity,
[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:30.160]   I mean, we do it primarily because I think it's good business.
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:33.160]   I think it makes a difference, but I also think it's good business.
[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:36.160]   So what I want is as many people able to do that as possible.
[00:31:36.160 --> 00:31:37.160]   That's a great point.
[00:31:37.160 --> 00:31:43.160]   So I, in the context of the arts, never go around telling artists what they ought to do to give away their work.
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:46.160]   I'm not trying to guilt anybody into giving away their rights.
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:51.160]   What we think is this might be a more effective way to make your work succeed.
[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:53.160]   That's the message there.
[00:31:53.160 --> 00:31:56.160]   Context of science, we have a related project, the Science Commons.
[00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:57.160]   It's very different.
[00:31:57.160 --> 00:31:59.160]   I mean, I think scientists have an ethic.
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:04.160]   It's an obligation, not just to produce knowledge, but to produce knowledge that's universally accessible.
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:14.160]   Because, you know, if you're in Africa, you can't pay a penny for the cost of access to, you know, a journal that might cost $10,000 a year to be distributed in Africa.
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:19.160]   So I think scientists have a moral obligation in some sense to make their work available in the way that artists don't.
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:22.160]   So, Creative Commons is just about, here's a bunch of tools.
[00:32:22.160 --> 00:32:24.160]   You figure out what works best for you.
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:27.160]   If you want to go to the Hollywood route, more power to you.
[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:32.160]   But if you want to have a more flexible system that might give you wider access, then we're just going to make it easy for you.
[00:32:32.160 --> 00:32:33.160]   Well, you're not losing anything either.
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:37.160]   I mean, when you're a software developer, giving away software in Africa, you're anywhere.
[00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:38.160]   They steal it anyway.
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:40.160]   I mean, I was in Zimbabwe for a month.
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:42.160]   And a bunch of movies came out.
[00:32:42.160 --> 00:32:46.160]   I had them two days after they were released to the theaters here.
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:48.160]   In China, you did them two weeks earlier.
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:53.160]   Yeah, I mean, so the thing is, is that it is, you're not losing anything.
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:58.160]   You're just getting to know who they are, you are expanding into that market.
[00:32:58.160 --> 00:33:00.160]   And when it builds up, you can change how that looks.
[00:33:00.160 --> 00:33:02.160]   When people have the money to do it.
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:03.160]   Well, I mean, the thing--
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:09.160]   It will definitely never happen if it's a culture of people doing it illegally and they have no intention of over and back.
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:13.160]   I wonder about that because China has both-- you had mixed messages.
[00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:19.160]   Because if you take a look at the amount of money people make on a monthly basis in China, and the fact that they're very heavily in the piracy,
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:24.160]   and that you can get these DVDs, very high quality ones and crappy ones, but mostly you can get the good ones.
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:27.160]   They're called DVD nines if you're over there looking around.
[00:33:27.160 --> 00:33:31.160]   Not that I've ever seen them yet.
[00:33:31.160 --> 00:33:40.160]   And they tend to be-- there's something kind of fishy about it because when you see these things, you can tell that they're from the master tapes.
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:41.160]   I mean, this is the date.
[00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:42.160]   This is the real deal.
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:45.160]   It's not like-- you know, they say they leave out some of the special features and stuff.
[00:33:45.160 --> 00:33:47.160]   They get others because they think it hasn't been quite finished.
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:49.160]   So there's a leak in the lab somewhere.
[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:53.160]   It's so deep there that it could be Hollywood looking for some extra income back doors for us.
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:55.160]   I'm concerned. It's pretty suspicious.
[00:33:55.160 --> 00:34:03.160]   I mean, you walk into the airport in Harari and they have DVDs where they have three movies on the same DVD.
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:05.160]   They've squished all three movies.
[00:34:05.160 --> 00:34:06.160]   You can do four X.
[00:34:06.160 --> 00:34:09.160]   And so they-- and that's just at a regular store.
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:10.160]   It's a big shiny store.
[00:34:10.160 --> 00:34:15.160]   If you go to Malaysia, then the big malls, they got big stores that sell DVDs and good quality.
[00:34:15.160 --> 00:34:16.160]   You can look at them.
[00:34:16.160 --> 00:34:17.160]   They'll just watch them.
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:19.160]   And it's a regular mall store.
[00:34:19.160 --> 00:34:22.160]   And then you can go down the hall and they have a Dessauffer store.
[00:34:22.160 --> 00:34:24.160]   And they have everything available for a dollar.
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:26.160]   It gets-- sorry for Hollywood.
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:27.160]   I mean, don't they have some--
[00:34:27.160 --> 00:34:29.160]   But the thing is, is it's right to protect themselves against them?
[00:34:29.160 --> 00:34:33.160]   You know, like he said earlier, you were-- because there's 20 million bucks isn't enough for these guys.
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:35.160]   I mean, you know, the line.
[00:34:35.160 --> 00:34:38.160]   But you know, there's-- you're talking about way different things.
[00:34:38.160 --> 00:34:40.160]   I mean, like, there's some funny way--
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:41.160]   No, I agree.
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:43.160]   You know, why Harari and Ben--
[00:34:43.160 --> 00:34:45.160]   --is that you're always a bit torn as keeping Bob from having a job.
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:47.160]   No, I'm not-- I'm not-- you know, you're--
[00:34:47.160 --> 00:34:48.160]   I'm not arguing with--
[00:34:48.160 --> 00:34:49.160]   --all about this.
[00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:53.160]   And the fact of the matter is the real problem for Hollywood are these massive production factories which--
[00:34:53.160 --> 00:34:54.160]   Not you and me.
[00:34:54.160 --> 00:34:58.160]   --not some guy downloading something from bit torn after eight hours.
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:02.160]   I mean, what kind of loss of money is that compared to some guys cranking these things?
[00:35:02.160 --> 00:35:03.160]   These are pressed.
[00:35:03.160 --> 00:35:05.160]   These are not like burned disks.
[00:35:05.160 --> 00:35:06.160]   They're pressed.
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:07.160]   They're pressed on a sh--
[00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:08.160]   Well, then they go after those guys.
[00:35:08.160 --> 00:35:09.160]   I mean, they're most--
[00:35:09.160 --> 00:35:10.160]   No, they don't.
[00:35:10.160 --> 00:35:11.160]   Oh, I seem to be--
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:12.160]   Maybe they just--
[00:35:12.160 --> 00:35:13.160]   --have to be a bunch of BS personally.
[00:35:13.160 --> 00:35:15.160]   They plow over a bunch of disks.
[00:35:15.160 --> 00:35:16.160]   They can't sell and they make a big deal.
[00:35:16.160 --> 00:35:19.160]   They're like, "Oh, I'm going with a lot less successful if you can imagine."
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:22.160]   Was it you Alex who were telling me there's-- there are places--
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:25.160]   Somewhere in Africa, there's a very vital film community.
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:26.160]   But they have to crank out a lot of movies.
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:29.160]   Well, in Nigeria, I was talking-- a friend of mine's a Nigerian filmmaker.
[00:35:29.160 --> 00:35:30.160]   And it was somewhere from him.
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:31.160]   I got a letter from him.
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:32.160]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:33.160]   He's the buddy of banks.
[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:34.160]   He's got a report.
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:38.160]   Yeah, but in Nigeria, they make-- Nigeria makes more films than anywhere else in the world.
[00:35:38.160 --> 00:35:39.160]   So it's more than India?
[00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:40.160]   More than India.
[00:35:40.160 --> 00:35:42.160]   India makes more than Hollywood.
[00:35:42.160 --> 00:35:45.160]   Nigeria makes more, but they're all about $15,000 films.
[00:35:45.160 --> 00:35:48.160]   And a lot of them are these kind of soap opera type of things.
[00:35:48.160 --> 00:35:51.160]   And-- but I was talking to him about the business model.
[00:35:51.160 --> 00:35:55.160]   And he said, the deal is, is we shoot the film, we get it to the theaters, and we get the
[00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:56.160]   DVD out as fast as we can.
[00:35:56.160 --> 00:35:58.160]   We've got about a week to make all of our money back.
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:01.160]   And then after that, the piracy takes over, and I'll never see another penny.
[00:36:01.160 --> 00:36:07.160]   But they're entire-- what they did is instead of trying to enforce it, which in Nigeria would be impossible,
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:10.160]   they built a business model around what worked.
[00:36:10.160 --> 00:36:11.160]   Right.
[00:36:11.160 --> 00:36:13.160]   And these guys are-- some of them are doing pretty well.
[00:36:13.160 --> 00:36:15.160]   They just-- it's just a whole different business model.
[00:36:15.160 --> 00:36:20.160]   This was directly driven by piracy, because originally it was Hollywood videos, which they were pirating.
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:23.160]   And that built an infrastructure of VCRs in people's houses, right?
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:28.160]   Because people wanted to have-- so then you had this infrastructure of VCRs, and then they could start doing their own
[00:36:28.160 --> 00:36:34.160]   Nigerian movies and take advantage of this infrastructure of VCRs and have this model that was, you know,
[00:36:34.160 --> 00:36:36.160]   very profitable, but very different from the model of Hollywood.
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:37.160]   And they make us--
[00:36:37.160 --> 00:36:40.160]   That's actually an interesting progression, you know.
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:42.160]   Hollywood say, would say that's where we're headed, right?
[00:36:42.160 --> 00:36:44.160]   If we don't do something about this, this is what's going to happen.
[00:36:44.160 --> 00:36:46.160]   You're not going to get, you know, Sylvester Stallone movies anymore.
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:52.160]   If you watch some of the trade stuff going on, they're already talking about moving that DVD release,
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:53.160]   stay closer and closer and closer.
[00:36:53.160 --> 00:36:58.160]   And I don't understand personally, because I think that people who really like a movie will go to the movie
[00:36:58.160 --> 00:37:01.160]   and by the DVD or by the DVD and go to the movie both.
[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:06.160]   But I think that if you went to a first run movie and they were selling the DVD of that film--
[00:37:06.160 --> 00:37:07.160]   At the theater.
[00:37:07.160 --> 00:37:12.160]   --at the theater, only at the theater, by the way, for the first run, I think they would get huge sales off of that
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:13.160]   and people would have a good time.
[00:37:13.160 --> 00:37:15.160]   The other thing's really cool is if you go out--
[00:37:15.160 --> 00:37:16.160]   Yeah, no, obviously.
[00:37:16.160 --> 00:37:18.160]   But with the-- what's in there?
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:21.160]   What's a movie that came out with the spaceship guys?
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:22.160]   Serenity.
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:25.160]   Rockstar's been doing that for years, as you walk out the door.
[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:30.160]   But if you go to Singapore, which of course has been suffering because of this piracy for a long time,
[00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:33.160]   and you go to a movie theater, it's an extraordinary experience.
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:37.160]   It's a first-class experience because they realize the only way to get you to come to the movie theater
[00:37:37.160 --> 00:37:38.160]   is if they make it really great.
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:42.160]   So you can get great food served to you, drink served to you as you're watching the movie.
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:45.160]   And it's all a sort of competitive way to try to beat the piracy.
[00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:46.160]   I think we're moving that way.
[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:51.160]   Well, in Europe, they've had great taquitos down in my theater.
[00:37:51.160 --> 00:37:52.160]   [laughter]
[00:37:52.160 --> 00:37:53.160]   What theater is this?
[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:55.160]   What are you living in Mexico City?
[00:37:55.160 --> 00:37:56.160]   No, they really do.
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:37:58.160]   They put them on the same roller as the hot dogs.
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:01.160]   Oh, geez, you're making me sick.
[00:38:01.160 --> 00:38:08.160]   I think that we're really looking at where content starts to split into screens like this.
[00:38:08.160 --> 00:38:10.160]   So you have these little screens.
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:12.160]   Disposable content and premium content.
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:13.160]   Premium content that's big screens.
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:17.160]   And it's not just big screens at the theater, it's big screens on your projection.
[00:38:17.160 --> 00:38:19.160]   When I look at what I want to have at home, I want to have a big projection,
[00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:23.160]   and when I want to watch big things like big films or whatever, I want to watch it.
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:27.160]   But watching shows like this, watching the news, a lot of the other things,
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:29.160]   I can happily watch on a little screen.
[00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:33.160]   Patrick, you're producing now twice a week a TV show for Ziff Davis.
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:35.160]   What is their hope for this?
[00:38:35.160 --> 00:38:37.160]   Is this a loss leader?
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:38.160]   Is this going to be a business?
[00:38:38.160 --> 00:38:46.160]   No, my fundamental assumption going into this in terms of the business model was that there was no point in trying to sell the content.
[00:38:46.160 --> 00:38:48.160]   Because you can't hold on to it.
[00:38:48.160 --> 00:38:56.160]   Especially with the, I mean, we've got a target audience that's like 60% of our audiences is accessing either directly through like VLC.
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:39:00.160]   Or we're at a worse position than anybody because we have the most sophisticated audience.
[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:01.160]   You know what I mean?
[00:39:01.160 --> 00:39:04.160]   So there's like, our whole audience is pretty advanced technically.
[00:39:04.160 --> 00:39:08.160]   So the idea of selling the episodes on the front side, there's just, there's no margin in it.
[00:39:08.160 --> 00:39:12.160]   Especially when you sit down and let us, the funniest thing at Web, the Web 2.0 conference,
[00:39:12.160 --> 00:39:14.160]   the most useful thing at the Web 2.0 conference.
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:15.160]   You still looking for something?
[00:39:15.160 --> 00:39:16.160]   No.
[00:39:16.160 --> 00:39:18.160]   I had some, you just shot me down so hard.
[00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:19.160]   It's all in a way.
[00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:25.160]   But they basically, one of the venture capital guys came up and he's like, look, I have a table of teenagers
[00:39:25.160 --> 00:39:27.160]   I use for polling, even information.
[00:39:27.160 --> 00:39:29.160]   He like, he plays 20 questions with him.
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:34.160]   And the question keeps him back is, nah, I get my music from, you know, you know, online.
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:36.160]   I get my movies from Napster.
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:39.160]   Yeah, I get all, we don't, we don't, we don't watch television through cable.
[00:39:39.160 --> 00:39:42.160]   We don't watch television shows through, and it keeps coming back to that.
[00:39:42.160 --> 00:39:45.160]   So for us, it's all advertising based and distribution.
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:46.160]   Dark.
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:47.160]   You know.
[00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:47.160]   Yes.
[00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:48.160]   Which is huge and growing.
[00:39:48.160 --> 00:39:49.160]   Huge.
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:51.160]   And there's no reason to think it'll stop growing.
[00:39:51.160 --> 00:39:55.160]   There's also, there are people who like, you know, there's exposure that you get as well.
[00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:59.160]   I mean, like the Pixel Core is working on shows that we're going to put out, you know, that are around visual effects
[00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:02.160]   and creating media and so on and so forth.
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:10.160]   We may have some sponsors, but we don't need a ton of sponsors because the show itself is increasing what people know about us.
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:18.160]   You know, and that, we've talked about this in previous tweets where if BMW did great shows about how they design cars,
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:20.160]   there'd be lots of people going to it.
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:22.160]   We're not selling anything.
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:23.160]   But we do have a plan.
[00:40:23.160 --> 00:40:24.160]   We have a plan.
[00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:26.160]   The more I guess it's revealed to anybody.
[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:27.160]   But there is.
[00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:30.160]   But Twit relies upon the largest and generosity of its viewers.
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:31.160]   That's actually really it.
[00:40:31.160 --> 00:40:32.160]   It's the good will of the viewers.
[00:40:32.160 --> 00:40:34.160]   If they don't want to pay for it, they don't pay for it.
[00:40:34.160 --> 00:40:35.160]   And I guess we'll go away.
[00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:37.160]   If they do pay for it, then we continue to do it.
[00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:38.160]   Which isn't it?
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:39.160]   I mean, that's a model, I guess.
[00:40:39.160 --> 00:40:40.160]   And you can decide to appoint.
[00:40:40.160 --> 00:40:42.160]   Even if you're going to sell it on iTunes.
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:45.160]   But only, I'll tell you, only 1% of the people who listen to Twit pay for it.
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:46.160]   Yeah.
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:47.160]   That's about right.
[00:40:47.160 --> 00:40:50.160]   But the other thing is we're not begging enough for money.
[00:40:50.160 --> 00:40:52.160]   The PBS model is the one you want.
[00:40:52.160 --> 00:40:53.160]   No, of course you don't.
[00:40:53.160 --> 00:40:54.160]   And who wants to?
[00:40:54.160 --> 00:40:56.160]   I'm just saying, you could crank that up to maybe 5%.
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:58.160]   The show stops after 30 minutes.
[00:40:58.160 --> 00:41:01.160]   You've got to donate to get to the other 30 minutes of show.
[00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:04.160]   I'm just saying, you could start begging for money.
[00:41:04.160 --> 00:41:07.160]   And I think you could push it up to maybe 5% of the viewers.
[00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:08.160]   Or the audience.
[00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:09.160]   Maybe.
[00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:13.160]   Or if you want to be like Gene Scott to the late Gene Scott,
[00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:15.160]   you could just basically put a show on that.
[00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:17.160]   Show of money for money.
[00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:23.160]   Well, I'd like to ask for money right now because we just spent a lot of money on cameras.
[00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:24.160]   And equipment.
[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:25.160]   We're not a third mixing board.
[00:41:25.160 --> 00:41:27.160]   Chris, people don't want to pay for my stupidity.
[00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:28.160]   So I don't know if that's the future.
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:29.160]   So the old mixing boards are evil.
[00:41:29.160 --> 00:41:30.160]   We'll sell it.
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:31.160]   We'll get them.
[00:41:31.160 --> 00:41:32.160]   I want to borrow them.
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:33.160]   John's going to take the old mixing.
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:34.160]   The Mackey.
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:36.160]   But there are expenses to making this a better production.
[00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:38.160]   And it's kind of an investment, I guess, in just...
[00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:41.160]   Well, there are, I mean, there are expenses in the RSS feed.
[00:41:41.160 --> 00:41:46.160]   I mean, I think nano porn is the future now.
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:48.160]   Yeah, I mean, you laugh, right?
[00:41:48.160 --> 00:41:50.160]   But there's nothing better than...
[00:41:50.160 --> 00:41:51.160]   You have to compete with the experts.
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:53.160]   That's the problem with the porn thing.
[00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:54.160]   Yeah, I know expert.
[00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:55.160]   I can tell you right now.
[00:41:55.160 --> 00:41:57.160]   Well, pal, I know.
[00:41:57.160 --> 00:41:58.160]   I don't want to know.
[00:41:58.160 --> 00:42:00.160]   This is drama.
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:02.160]   But seriously, I mean, the whole point is like...
[00:42:02.160 --> 00:42:04.160]   I'm sorry.
[00:42:04.160 --> 00:42:06.160]   Can you cut that part out?
[00:42:06.160 --> 00:42:09.160]   No, these are very metric.
[00:42:09.160 --> 00:42:13.160]   (laughter)
[00:42:13.160 --> 00:42:15.160]   That's a visual we'd like not to go any farther.
[00:42:15.160 --> 00:42:16.160]   It's a little porn.
[00:42:16.160 --> 00:42:17.160]   I'm so sorry.
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:18.160]   (laughter)
[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:21.160]   But no, if you think about the part of the issue with Hollywood, right?
[00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:23.160]   Hollywood isn't about producing movies.
[00:42:23.160 --> 00:42:25.160]   Hollywood is a very complicated,
[00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:27.160]   - It's a marketing machine. - It's a marketing machine.
[00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:28.160]   It's an investment.
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:30.160]   It's a really peculiar style of investment.
[00:42:30.160 --> 00:42:33.160]   And a long-term investment in making money.
[00:42:33.160 --> 00:42:36.160]   - You know, I mean, in the same way that it's from... - We think of it as artists, but it's bankers.
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:38.160]   And it has been since Louis B. Mayer.
[00:42:38.160 --> 00:42:40.160]   Yeah, there's nothing new about it.
[00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:42.160]   And I think that that's the...
[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:45.160]   You know, the whole point of the production model is...
[00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:48.160]   It's even more organized in the record industry.
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:51.160]   The record industry is like, "Let's put out a whole bunch of sh*t and see what..."
[00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:52.160]   I can't curse.
[00:42:52.160 --> 00:42:54.160]   - Sorry. - I haven't done that.
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:55.160]   - I'm sorry. - I'm not going to cut out here.
[00:42:55.160 --> 00:42:57.160]   - I'm sorry. - But it's like the record industry.
[00:42:57.160 --> 00:43:02.160]   And you look at the amount of garbage that's cranked out versus what actually sells.
[00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:03.160]   You know what I mean?
[00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:04.160]   It's like the...
[00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:07.160]   It just costs too much to make movies to be that haphazard in your production model.
[00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:12.160]   - So, you know, many mainstream artists or labels or movie companies look to creative commoners
[00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:13.160]   in a way of distributing them.
[00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:15.160]   - So, the answer is yes.
[00:43:15.160 --> 00:43:19.160]   And they're basically next generation people who are looking at it.
[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:22.160]   - If you're already Metallica, you don't need to do that.
[00:43:22.160 --> 00:43:26.160]   - Although, you know, when Wired released the Wired CD that had people like David Byrne
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:29.160]   and the Beastie Boys and Chuck D and Roberto Gill,
[00:43:29.160 --> 00:43:32.160]   releasing tracks under the license that allowed people to remix it,
[00:43:32.160 --> 00:43:36.160]   that was the first time we kind of cracked into that space.
[00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:39.160]   - The one thing I want to say about Metallica, by the way, is that, you know,
[00:43:39.160 --> 00:43:44.160]   I worked in the radio industry when they switched, when Billboard had to switch.
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:46.160]   - When Billboard had to switch. - You had some Metallica.
[00:43:46.160 --> 00:43:49.160]   - No, no, no, no, no. - This is an interesting story.
[00:43:49.160 --> 00:43:51.160]   Have you told us in the show?
[00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:52.160]   - I don't think I've shown the show.
[00:43:52.160 --> 00:43:54.160]   - So, I used to work for Sony Music.
[00:43:54.160 --> 00:43:55.160]   So, that was...
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:57.160]   - Thanks for the mix, so cool.
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:43:59.160]   You're sort of paying penance.
[00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:00.160]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:44:00.160 --> 00:44:01.160]   - Yeah.
[00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:02.160]   - No, I worked...
[00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:05.160]   And this is when I came out, CDs were just coming out when I was working there
[00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:09.160]   and I was saying these should be cheap, because I knew they cost 44 cents out of the factory
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:11.160]   and we should be charging $4, but they were like,
[00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:14.160]   "Well, they're perceived as higher than albums, so we'll charge more than album
[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:15.160]   'cause we can get it."
[00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:17.160]   - You know, and they still do.
[00:44:17.160 --> 00:44:18.160]   - And they still do.
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:19.160]   - And they still do.
[00:44:19.160 --> 00:44:20.160]   - They're ridiculous.
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:22.160]   - Remember those early years they were expecting the price to drop to drop to drop
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:23.160]   than every day, every day.
[00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:24.160]   - And it went up.
[00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:25.160]   - And it went up.
[00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:26.160]   - And it went up.
[00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:27.160]   - And it went up.
[00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:28.160]   - And it went up.
[00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:29.160]   - And it went up.
[00:44:29.160 --> 00:44:30.160]   - And it went up.
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:31.160]   - And it went up.
[00:44:31.160 --> 00:44:32.160]   - And it went up.
[00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:33.160]   - And it went up.
[00:44:33.160 --> 00:44:34.160]   - And it went up.
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:35.160]   You'd call guys.
[00:44:35.160 --> 00:44:37.160]   You know, we, it was all this, not Paola.
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:39.160]   We didn't do Paola, but we would take guys out for dinner all the time.
[00:44:39.160 --> 00:44:40.160]   - Yeah, that's back scratching.
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:42.160]   - I'd take guys out for dinner all the time.
[00:44:42.160 --> 00:44:44.160]   I'd make sure they got to go behind the scenes and hang out.
[00:44:44.160 --> 00:44:45.160]   - That was a music director.
[00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:46.160]   - I know.
[00:44:46.160 --> 00:44:47.160]   - Yeah, we took guys like it.
[00:44:47.160 --> 00:44:51.160]   You know, and we took them into, you know, into Alice and Chains tour bus or whatever it was.
[00:44:51.160 --> 00:44:52.160]   - Yeah.
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:54.160]   - And I love you and I'd say, "Sure, whatever you want now."
[00:44:54.160 --> 00:44:57.160]   - Yeah, and then I'd call, what I'd do is we have lists that we have to manage, you know,
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:45:01.160]   and so, and I'm trying to get up the list and I get my bonuses are all connected to that.
[00:45:01.160 --> 00:45:06.160]   - It's a lot rotation.
[00:45:06.160 --> 00:45:11.160]   - Yeah, and so can you bump that from light to medium?
[00:45:11.160 --> 00:45:15.160]   That's all I need you to do or, or, or, but the main thing is is that people would have the raw,
[00:45:15.160 --> 00:45:19.160]   how many they sold, you know, at the record store, but I would get them to bump.
[00:45:19.160 --> 00:45:22.160]   You know, I know that it only, it was number 20th, but can you bump at the 15th?
[00:45:22.160 --> 00:45:23.160]   You know, can you do that?
[00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:25.160]   And they'd be like, "Oh, sure, you know, no problem."
[00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:27.160]   And it was all this stuff that, you know, and it was just favors.
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:30.160]   It wasn't like we were paying them or I was, you know, giving them Coke or something like that.
[00:45:30.160 --> 00:45:31.160]   - Exactly.
[00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:35.160]   - I got it from my dad's wife, Satter, and I didn't know it was Coke.
[00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:38.160]   I was putting on my, you can't put it, I didn't.
[00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:39.160]   - Yeah, it's for the deal memos.
[00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:42.160]   - You're walking in a bludgeon, 20 year olds that are terribly infused,
[00:45:42.160 --> 00:45:43.160]   - Yeah.
[00:45:43.160 --> 00:45:44.160]   - of putting their asses.
[00:45:44.160 --> 00:45:47.160]   - But the important thing was, is that Billboard decided they were enough of the shenanigans.
[00:45:47.160 --> 00:45:53.160]   They said it has to be electronically, you know, so they switched, and I think 19, I want to say 1991 or whatever.
[00:45:53.160 --> 00:45:55.160]   They switched to electronic reporting.
[00:45:55.160 --> 00:46:01.160]   One week it just went from you hand-write it to it's keeping track of who you're scanning in and who you're selling,
[00:46:01.160 --> 00:46:04.160]   and it has to be that way, or you wouldn't be able to do the sales.
[00:46:04.160 --> 00:46:09.160]   And suddenly, in one week, Metallica goes top 10, Garth Brooks runs to number one.
[00:46:09.160 --> 00:46:12.160]   - These guys were selling, but they were never given credit.
[00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:16.160]   - They were never given credit for it, and suddenly, that's what brought on, you know, a lot of stuff,
[00:46:16.160 --> 00:46:22.160]   because suddenly they all jump to the front, and the thing is, is when you look at this illegal, you know, thing,
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:26.160]   there's a lot of bands that are moving around all through the BitTorrent ether,
[00:46:26.160 --> 00:46:31.160]   and they don't get the proper recognition because no one can say that they're listening to them, you know,
[00:46:31.160 --> 00:46:36.160]   and so, and when, if you were able to report it, you know, it would be a much, you know, different thing, you know,
[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:39.160]   and I think that that's something that, I think that's the point of the story.
[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:40.160]   - So what's the point of the story?
[00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:42.160]   - The point is, is that by making it a great story.
[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:48.160]   - No, but the point of the story is that we have more people watching the Twit broadcast, and we're getting credit, right?
[00:46:48.160 --> 00:46:51.160]   - Yeah, no, the point is that, is that the, is that the,
[00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:56.160]   when you make things illegal, you know, people aren't getting, it's not just that they're not getting money for it,
[00:46:56.160 --> 00:47:01.160]   they're also, they're not getting recognition that people are listening to it, which creates the buzz that sells albums.
[00:47:01.160 --> 00:47:04.160]   - You gotta twist this around, let me say a really strong point.
[00:47:04.160 --> 00:47:07.160]   - Oh, you know, you work on it. - Just same.
[00:47:07.160 --> 00:47:09.160]   - It's a twist. - It's a twist. - It just dies off.
[00:47:09.160 --> 00:47:13.160]   - Well, fine. - You know, and that's why when you look, I mean, for podcasts, you look at the top--
[00:47:13.160 --> 00:47:15.160]   - There's a point in this. I'm gonna use that story when my column's.
[00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:20.160]   - The top 20 lists on podcasts, there's a real debate over what Yahoo's doing, which is,
[00:47:20.160 --> 00:47:24.160]   whatever is the most right. - Oh, there's a bunch of podcasts who gets the most correct experience.
[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:27.160]   - Web sites that they have the top 10, there's a dream in it up.
[00:47:27.160 --> 00:47:32.160]   - It's votes, it's, and I think it would be very valuable for us to know, and maybe we wouldn't be number one.
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:35.160]   I know, that's not the point. - Well, we would be, I mean, it's something that is--
[00:47:35.160 --> 00:47:37.160]   - Who really is most listened to, that's valuable.
[00:47:37.160 --> 00:47:40.160]   - Well, I think that one of the biggest problems right now with the iTunes music store is that,
[00:47:40.160 --> 00:47:44.160]   is that you only know what the top 20 are, and you don't know what the top 10 are.
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:47.160]   - What you don't know is what is the top 10 of, what's the top 10 of tech?
[00:47:47.160 --> 00:47:49.160]   - Top 10. - What is the top 10 of religion?
[00:47:49.160 --> 00:47:53.160]   What are the top 10 of religion? - And that one-- - Because if you think about Chris Anderson's long tail here--
[00:47:53.160 --> 00:47:57.160]   - They could, and they don't. - So if you think of Chris Anderson's long tail story, right,
[00:47:57.160 --> 00:48:02.160]   so the whole future is about not what the top 50 is, it's the next 300.
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:06.160]   And so finding some way to give recognition even if the next 300 is to figure out what's going to be next.
[00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:12.160]   - Why does he say that? - Well, so Chris's point is that in the digital world, it's not the top 50 that matters.
[00:48:12.160 --> 00:48:14.160]   - Yes. - It's everything after the top 50.
[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:18.160]   - Yes, it's just one of mine that's done. - But you weren't a subscriber to blog,
[00:48:18.160 --> 00:48:21.160]   so you weren't a subscriber to head. - Podcasting.
[00:48:21.160 --> 00:48:25.160]   - But he was a small amount of traffic. - Thank you Larry.
[00:48:25.160 --> 00:48:29.160]   - I don't know, but a small amount of traffic over an extended period of time adds up.
[00:48:29.160 --> 00:48:34.160]   - You know, it reminds me of the whole thing. The guys who are on network television still get the attention.
[00:48:34.160 --> 00:48:38.160]   I don't care what, you know, people always think in the dullest little stuff is going to mount to a hill of beans.
[00:48:38.160 --> 00:48:40.160]   - No, but when there was just a great television-- - Get out of the agency, man.
[00:48:40.160 --> 00:48:43.160]   - I don't know. It's not saying you shouldn't be on ABC. If you can be on ABC, that's great.
[00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:49.160]   But the point is, in the digital world, the person whose number 1500 can actually start having a market.
[00:48:49.160 --> 00:48:53.160]   And in the analog world, they couldn't have a market because you couldn't produce and sell it for you.
[00:48:53.160 --> 00:48:59.160]   - And in the real world, we're number 1500. We're maybe number 15,000. I mean, we may be successful as a podcast, but that's nothing.
[00:48:59.160 --> 00:49:03.160]   Although I have to say, I will be on ABC in December doing "Redes and Kelly."
[00:49:03.160 --> 00:49:09.160]   - And I don't get anywhere near the attention that I get for doing that every three months,
[00:49:09.160 --> 00:49:13.160]   but do a number one podcast and the Wall Street Journal calls you.
[00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:16.160]   - CNBC has less numbers than we have. - Absolutely.
[00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:22.160]   - But they make more money. - And the people on the show can get paid up to $1 million a year.
[00:49:22.160 --> 00:49:28.160]   - CNBC makes more money than NBC because it's 50,000 people, but it's the right 50 people.
[00:49:28.160 --> 00:49:31.160]   - Or at least it was during the .com era when they were throwing money. - I don't get back.
[00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:38.160]   - CNBC's got potential. I mean, look at the Larry Kramer's, or not Larry, but Jim Kramer's mad at you.
[00:49:38.160 --> 00:49:41.160]   - I want to get that 40 as it presses the button.
[00:49:41.160 --> 00:49:42.160]   - Yeah. - Fuck.
[00:49:42.160 --> 00:49:43.160]   - Fuck.
[00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:43.160]   - Yeah.
[00:49:43.160 --> 00:49:48.160]   - I don't know how many times you can watch that show, but it's entertainment, you know, once in a while.
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:50.160]   - You cannot. Should we pause for a moment?
[00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:51.160]   - Are we?
[00:49:51.160 --> 00:49:53.160]   - No, we're still recording it. - These are just backup tapes.
[00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:54.160]   - Oh, okay.
[00:49:54.160 --> 00:50:00.160]   - We know what it keeps coming back to is like, who's making money and how do you pay, how do you make it pay for itself?
[00:50:00.160 --> 00:50:01.160]   - Yeah.
[00:50:01.160 --> 00:50:06.160]   - But like, versus we have, you know, 200, 250,000, you know, people listening to this podcast,
[00:50:06.160 --> 00:50:09.160]   - or a half a million, we don't know. - We don't know. It could be half a million.
[00:50:09.160 --> 00:50:10.160]   - At least 200,000.
[00:50:10.160 --> 00:50:11.160]   - Yeah. Let's say we're very concerned.
[00:50:11.160 --> 00:50:12.160]   - That number.
[00:50:12.160 --> 00:50:18.160]   - Let's say 1% or 2% are willing to buy the show for $1.99, and let's say we get a dollar out of it.
[00:50:18.160 --> 00:50:21.160]   That starts to get pretty close to, you know, yeah.
[00:50:21.160 --> 00:50:22.160]   - Let me get a math.
[00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:23.160]   - Yeah.
[00:50:23.160 --> 00:50:26.160]   - 2% of, let's say we have a half a million and 2% is $10,000 and we get a dollar.
[00:50:26.160 --> 00:50:27.160]   - That's right.
[00:50:27.160 --> 00:50:28.160]   - It's like $10,000 per show.
[00:50:28.160 --> 00:50:29.160]   - That's not bad.
[00:50:29.160 --> 00:50:30.160]   - And the thing is- - Considering the cost of making it.
[00:50:30.160 --> 00:50:31.160]   - Right.
[00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:32.160]   - The point is that-
[00:50:32.160 --> 00:50:40.160]   - If you can get to a point, there's a huge future, I think, and in the emerging world, there's an incredible future for shows that make $3,000 to $5,000 a show.
[00:50:40.160 --> 00:50:41.160]   - Absolutely.
[00:50:41.160 --> 00:50:45.160]   - You know, and the thing is- - Call for help costs me $2,700 to produce call for help.
[00:50:45.160 --> 00:50:46.160]   - Right.
[00:50:46.160 --> 00:50:48.160]   - If we could make $5,000, we would have a profit.
[00:50:48.160 --> 00:50:49.160]   - And you have a whole lot of them.
[00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:52.160]   - And the problem is that- - Yeah, the key. You have to have a lot of them because making-
[00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:54.160]   - And you could- - Three grand here and there.
[00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:56.160]   - And this is- - Look, there is interest-
[00:50:56.160 --> 00:51:00.160]   - You look like- - Wait, what's the last time anybody in this table had a real job?
[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:01.160]   - Making three grand here and there.
[00:51:01.160 --> 00:51:04.160]   I know people kill for a lot less than three grand.
[00:51:04.160 --> 00:51:05.160]   - I have a real job.
[00:51:05.160 --> 00:51:06.160]   - Well, I know.
[00:51:06.160 --> 00:51:07.160]   You have a word saying.
[00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:09.160]   - What I'm saying is like, you know, I spent last year-
[00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:10.160]   - It's chicken feed.
[00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:12.160]   - It's chicken feed for you, but if you leave it-
[00:51:12.160 --> 00:51:13.160]   - Chicken feed for you too.
[00:51:13.160 --> 00:51:14.160]   - Chicken feed for you too.
