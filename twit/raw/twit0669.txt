[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   You know, it seems like an annual, it is an annual ritual.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   So why not?
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   I'll tell you somebody who is not invited, besides me.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   [Laughs]
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   And we welcome them for the first time to Twit, but I've been wanting to get this guy for a long time.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Seth Weintraub is here. Seth, you're probably known as the publisher of Electric, which is the electric.com
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   is the magazine about electric vehicles. He's founded, created 9 to 5 Mac, 9 to 5 Google.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   And you said you have a new one Seth.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   Yeah, we have a new site called Drown DJ.com.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   So great to have you here.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   I've been a fan from a distance for a long time.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   And we met a year ago at Google I/O, and I've been meaning ever since to get you on the show.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   So I'm so glad you could get it.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   And Seth Ribles, me, is one of your few guests with a professional microphone.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   It looks good. I like it.
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Yeah, what kind of mic is that?
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   It's a road podcaster.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   Oh, see.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Okay.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   But it looks like an R-E20.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   It looks like an R-E20.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Do you do an electric podcast?
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Yeah, we do.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Every Friday at like 4.30, 5 o'clock.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Nice.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   I have so many questions about electric vehicles.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   And we actually were talking before the show, but I'm sure there'll be more to talk about
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   as the show progresses.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   Also, where are you located Seth?
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Are you in the West Coast?
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   No, I'm actually in New York City, a little bit north in Westchester.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Okay.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   So it's evening where you are.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   But it's late at night where this guy is Greg Farrow joins us from the Packet Pusher's
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   network.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   He is a network wizard and always fun on the show.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   And thank you for staying up late for us.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   He's pulling the muff off his professional road podcaster.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Wow, three professional microphone.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Oh, yes.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   That's a record.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   I love that.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   I'll leave it off.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   I'll put it back on.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   Yeah, you know.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   I have an old-fashioned analog road, as a matter of fact.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   Oh, really?
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   Three roads and a high.
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   I've got it hooked up to a USB adapter, but it's analog to begin with.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   Sounds like a road is a Australian company.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Is it not?
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   I believe so.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   Oh, yes.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   They do it all out of Melbourne, I think.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   Oh, I did not know that.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Yeah.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.280]   Yeah, the road podcaster was one of the very first really good microphones that you could
[00:04:38.280 --> 00:04:41.000]   use, USB microphones you could use as a podcast.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:42.520]   Yeah, I use road for everything.
[00:04:42.520 --> 00:04:48.920]   I use it for the, when I do YouTube, I'm using the road video micro pro, which goes on the
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.360]   back and runs off my iPhone.
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.600]   And that's how I do all of my YouTube.
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.560]   I used to have this massive camera rig recording in 4K.
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.920]   And I've ended up just plugging my iPhone into a hand rig.
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:00.920]   That's all I ever use.
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:07.480]   Yeah, I have a road stereo mic for my Canon with a big dead cat on it.
[00:05:07.480 --> 00:05:11.560]   And I'm not saying that because I don't like cats, although I don't.
[00:05:11.560 --> 00:05:13.120]   So I just use this.
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:14.120]   There it is.
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.120]   That's a big puffy muff.
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.440]   Yeah, I have a glyph and this is my little roady video thing.
[00:05:19.440 --> 00:05:21.680]   And then just click the camera in and plug it in.
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:22.680]   And that's how I do YouTube.
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.680]   Awesome.
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:25.840]   I've ever showed you the microphone that CBF issued me for field work.
[00:05:25.840 --> 00:05:26.840]   Oh, this I got to see.
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:27.840]   Yeah, nothing great.
[00:05:27.840 --> 00:05:30.440]   So this is from the Tiffany network.
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:33.520]   This mic, if you look at it really closely, you probably can't see it.
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:34.520]   It says mutual.
[00:05:34.520 --> 00:05:38.480]   So you saw the previous acquired mutual a million years ago.
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:40.720]   So that mic is literally from the 60s.
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:41.720]   It is.
[00:05:41.720 --> 00:05:43.720]   So I plugged this guy into it a little short.
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.720]   Is that a sure?
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:45.720]   It looks like a sure SM58.
[00:05:45.720 --> 00:05:47.720]   Well, now it's now it's a USB it, right?
[00:05:47.720 --> 00:05:48.720]   So this is the USB.
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:49.720]   Yeah, you get the icicle on it.
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.360]   So when this when this mic rolled off the assembly line, USB wasn't even a pipe dream.
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.360]   That's got it.
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:58.160]   But take off the muff because I want to see what the top of it.
[00:05:58.160 --> 00:06:01.160]   Oh, gosh, I could tell you what it is from the problem.
[00:06:01.160 --> 00:06:02.160]   Right.
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.160]   That's an SF58 sure is.
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:06.080]   No, no, no, no, this is the the SF50.
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:07.080]   This is an electric voice.
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:08.080]   Oh, it's an EV.
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:09.080]   35 eight.
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:10.080]   Yeah, they made one very similar.
[00:06:10.080 --> 00:06:11.080]   It's bigger.
[00:06:11.080 --> 00:06:12.080]   Yeah.
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:14.400]   This is a real this mic is like the mic for finally.
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.000]   I think Edward R. Murrow used that mic.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:19.040]   This particular mic.
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.800]   He actually could have that would not have been impossible for him to view this one.
[00:06:23.800 --> 00:06:28.160]   So just in case you ever wanted to know how little voice has changed in 40 years, you've
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:29.360]   just witnessed it right there.
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:30.360]   The XLR jack.
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:31.360]   Yeah.
[00:06:31.360 --> 00:06:32.960]   There's nothing new in voice technology.
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:33.960]   Nothing's changed.
[00:06:33.960 --> 00:06:35.240]   Nothing's changed.
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:40.520]   So dub dub DC is tomorrow the worldwide developers conference.
[00:06:40.520 --> 00:06:42.400]   And I hope you don't mind.
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:44.200]   Seth if I invoke Mark Gurman.
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.800]   No, no, we're still good friends.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:47.800]   Great guy.
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:48.800]   Of course, cut his teeth.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:52.000]   He was like 15 when you hired him at nine to five Mac.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   I think so.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   Maybe even younger.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   He was a kid and he was 22 two years ago when Bloomberg stole him away from you.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:02.440]   And he's done a good job over there.
[00:07:02.440 --> 00:07:08.160]   He's kept all of his contacts and he said something quite surprising on Friday.
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:11.120]   I can't tell you because I don't pay for Bloomberg.
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:15.120]   They've put themselves behind a ridiculous $35 a month pay wall.
[00:07:15.120 --> 00:07:16.680]   Oh my God.
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.160]   Yeah.
[00:07:18.160 --> 00:07:26.280]   But he says his sources tell him Apple will not unveil any new hardware tomorrow.
[00:07:26.280 --> 00:07:28.960]   And I have to give first of all, it's Gurman.
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.240]   So it's, you know, his sources are impeccable and he's rarely wrong.
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:38.820]   But also this close to the event, I have to think this is a leak from Apple trying to
[00:07:38.820 --> 00:07:40.480]   dampen expectations.
[00:07:40.480 --> 00:07:44.040]   Because if people didn't know that the expectations been high though, there will at least be new
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:48.800]   Mac books, possibly new iPads, maybe even a new iPhone SE.
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:51.760]   And if they hadn't told people that ahead of time, there'd be a lot of disappointment
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:52.760]   tomorrow.
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:55.400]   I think that Robert Mueller leaked it actually.
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.760]   That's what Trump said.
[00:07:57.760 --> 00:07:59.680]   Nothing comes out of Robert Mueller's office.
[00:07:59.680 --> 00:08:01.440]   This we know.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:04.440]   So Seth, you think that's credible?
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.480]   So well, I don't think Apple leaked it.
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:08.480]   Right.
[00:08:08.480 --> 00:08:09.480]   Not to Gurman.
[00:08:09.480 --> 00:08:11.640]   If Apple leaked it, it'd be a Wall Street Journal.
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:13.480]   Yeah, you know how it works.
[00:08:13.480 --> 00:08:18.800]   But so clearly, you know, there's probably, there might be, you know, they could announce
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:22.480]   something's coming way down the road or something, but there's not going to be any, it doesn't
[00:08:22.480 --> 00:08:25.200]   sound like there's going to be any new hardware at WWDC.
[00:08:25.200 --> 00:08:30.200]   You know, there's a lot of stuff that's in the pipe.
[00:08:30.200 --> 00:08:34.200]   Like, like there has to be some new Macs coming soon.
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:37.080]   Everything's kind of long in the tooth there.
[00:08:37.080 --> 00:08:39.000]   You know, we know about the SE 2 or whatever.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   I'm not sure about that.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.320]   Do you really think that there's actually going to be some new Macs?
[00:08:42.320 --> 00:08:44.680]   Like Intel hasn't got any new CPUs.
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:45.680]   There'll be no new--
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:46.680]   No wait a minute.
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.680]   No wait a minute.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:48.680]   No wait a minute.
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:49.680]   This was the exciting, this was the thing I was waiting for.
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:54.640]   I was waiting for a MacBook Pro with one of these new six core Intel processors and
[00:08:54.640 --> 00:08:56.360]   i9 and Optane.
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:09:01.040]   I think that that actually is some pretty compelling hardware, which just came out.
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:06.800]   Intel announced it and then said it won't be shipping until mid 2019 this week.
[00:09:06.800 --> 00:09:07.800]   What?
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:08.800]   The i9 won't come out.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:09.800]   No Optane.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:10.800]   What?
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:11.800]   No Optane and no Canon Lakes.
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:14.280]   Nothing will ship till mid 2000.
[00:09:14.280 --> 00:09:16.720]   Like they'll release sampling quantities.
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:20.680]   I was reading an article about they're releasing like a hundred thousand or something and then
[00:09:20.680 --> 00:09:22.760]   all the Macs will share a small number.
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:27.040]   So there'll be something that ships and Intel will meet the promise that something will
[00:09:27.040 --> 00:09:29.440]   ship in 2018.
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:31.480]   But there'll be no volume CPU.
[00:09:31.480 --> 00:09:34.960]   So there's a fair chance that Apple won't commit to a small production.
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:35.960]   No.
[00:09:35.960 --> 00:09:36.960]   In my opinion.
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:37.960]   Yeah.
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:38.960]   What do you think Seth?
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:39.960]   You're the expert in this field.
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:44.760]   You're very aggressive in their Mac world anything lately.
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:46.840]   I mean, I feel like ever.
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:51.800]   It was always the case that actually no, maybe there was a time when Intel would have a new
[00:09:51.800 --> 00:09:55.280]   processor and then shortly after that Apple would have new Macs.
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:09:57.200]   But that has not been the case for so long.
[00:09:57.200 --> 00:09:58.200]   My Mac was the area.
[00:09:58.200 --> 00:10:00.240]   Yeah, it feels like that was a little bit of a microphone that I showed you.
[00:10:00.240 --> 00:10:01.720]   I mean, it's getting it's getting crazy.
[00:10:01.720 --> 00:10:02.720]   Oh, I could be you.
[00:10:02.720 --> 00:10:03.720]   Here.
[00:10:03.720 --> 00:10:04.720]   My Mac Pro is from 2013.
[00:10:04.720 --> 00:10:07.720]   Can you beat me on that one?
[00:10:07.720 --> 00:10:10.880]   But the Macs look here that I have doesn't look any different than the one that came out
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:12.760]   what 2010?
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:14.360]   When did they first ship that?
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:17.560]   The truth is because I hate these new Mac keyboards so much.
[00:10:17.560 --> 00:10:19.880]   This butterfly key is awful.
[00:10:19.880 --> 00:10:26.280]   I bought when the 2016 new MacBook Pros with the touch bar and the butterfly key came out.
[00:10:26.280 --> 00:10:28.320]   I bought one immediately.
[00:10:28.320 --> 00:10:29.880]   I hated the touch bar so much.
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:32.840]   I would hit the Siri would start up randomly.
[00:10:32.840 --> 00:10:36.360]   So because I would hit it and I didn't and I thought, well, if I've got a touch bar, I
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:37.840]   can't disable it.
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:42.040]   So I just said, OK, I'm going to trade this in for the one without the touch bar, but the
[00:10:42.040 --> 00:10:43.080]   keyboard was still bad.
[00:10:43.080 --> 00:10:49.680]   So I went back to the 2015 Macbook Pro, which is frankly the last decent Mac book.
[00:10:49.680 --> 00:10:51.480]   It's hard to do with that.
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:54.920]   There's a lot of people who don't like the keyboard and a lot more people who don't like
[00:10:54.920 --> 00:10:56.560]   the touch bar.
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:10:57.560]   Yeah.
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:10:58.560]   Yeah.
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:10:59.720]   Apple still sells.
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:03.760]   They still sell this 2015 15 inch MacBook Pro.
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:06.320]   That tells me there's a reason.
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:09.760]   That tells me there's a market for them.
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:10.760]   Yeah.
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:11.760]   Well, I imagine those guys.
[00:11:11.760 --> 00:11:16.280]   I bet they they must or why would Apple keep them in the the folder?
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:18.720]   It's still a Haswell processor.
[00:11:18.720 --> 00:11:20.000]   Well, I think there's a couple of things here.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.400]   One is Skylake was the 2015 CPU.
[00:11:23.400 --> 00:11:28.920]   And that was the last MacBook that Apple released that had that and that was the major CPU release.
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:31.800]   Since then in 2016, we've had the Intel server CPUs.
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:37.000]   So we've had Kaby Lake was the successor to Skylake, which was really the TOC, not the
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   tech.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   It's been TOC, TOC, TOC, TOC.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   TOC, TOC, TOC.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.720]   Then you had Canon Lake in 2017 and Coffee Lake, which was meant to, but they sort of hadn't
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:47.280]   shipped in volume.
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.480]   So they're die shrinks.
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:51.320]   So, so Skylake was a 14 nanometer.
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:54.080]   Canon Lake is a shrink of Skylake to 10 nanometers.
[00:11:54.080 --> 00:11:55.760]   So less power, more on the die.
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:59.800]   It gets a little bit faster than this Coffee Lake, which was meant to be a 14 nanometer
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:00.800]   approach.
[00:12:00.800 --> 00:12:03.080]   I'm reading from Wikipedia here and I'm because I can't memorize all this just in case you
[00:12:03.080 --> 00:12:04.440]   think I'm looking smart.
[00:12:04.440 --> 00:12:07.800]   And then there's supposed to be a thing coming, which is called Islaik, which is the successor
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:08.800]   to Canon Lake.
[00:12:08.800 --> 00:12:09.800]   It's for the Canadians.
[00:12:09.800 --> 00:12:14.400]   And it was supposed to come out at the end of 2017.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:17.600]   Then they said 2018 and now it's 2019.
[00:12:17.600 --> 00:12:22.640]   Somebody says, there's what you're saying is there's no reason for Apple to upgrade.
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:25.040]   Well, there's no CPU updates.
[00:12:25.040 --> 00:12:29.240]   I think you know how we keep hearing all about this ARM CPU thing that keep people keep going
[00:12:29.240 --> 00:12:33.920]   and that Apple is going to be switching away from Intel and switch to ARM for all of its
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:34.920]   stuff.
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:40.240]   I imagine that, you know, if Intel keeps upsetting the supply chain here, which is exactly what
[00:12:40.240 --> 00:12:44.400]   they're doing, I imagine if I was Apple, I'd be sitting there saying to myself, if Intel
[00:12:44.400 --> 00:12:49.760]   can't ship these desktop CPUs, whatever the reason might be, whether it's difficult to
[00:12:49.760 --> 00:12:53.920]   shrink the dial, where they can't get the production runs or nobody's buying desktops
[00:12:53.920 --> 00:12:58.520]   or whatever the mechanics are, Apple might actually start looking at the PA semi team
[00:12:58.520 --> 00:13:03.320]   and saying, you know, can we boost this ARM CPU and turn so they can turn away from Intel
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:04.320]   as a supplier?
[00:13:04.320 --> 00:13:08.160]   Because every time they go public with the Intel CPU, you know, saying we've got MacBooks
[00:13:08.160 --> 00:13:12.040]   in the pipe, or they start to sort of feel people out to see if there's any interest for
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:15.040]   a new frame, Intel fails to ship.
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:16.600]   Now I agree with you.
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:17.600]   I'm shocked.
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:18.600]   I was.
[00:13:18.600 --> 00:13:20.480]   I, you, this is bad news.
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.680]   I thought the I-9 was imminent.
[00:13:22.680 --> 00:13:23.680]   Nine.
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:24.680]   It's all.
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:28.480]   And I was going to, I was, I was, what I was hoping was that tomorrow, when I was going
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:34.780]   to see new MacBooks with new Intel processors and perhaps a concession to the class action
[00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:38.720]   lawsuits, a somewhat improved keyboard.
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:42.320]   And then when I, when Mark said, well, no, there's not going to be new hardware, I credited
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:43.320]   him.
[00:13:43.320 --> 00:13:44.320]   I thought, well, it's Mark Gurman.
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:45.320]   It must be true.
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:48.520]   So I started looking at Lenovo, but they don't have the I-9s and they won't, I guess,
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:49.520]   until next year.
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:50.520]   Yeah.
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:55.920]   I mean, they talked about the isolate chips in August, then they announced them.
[00:13:55.920 --> 00:13:57.680]   And then remember, of course, they talked about Optane.
[00:13:57.680 --> 00:14:00.520]   We were talking about Optane 18 months in 2016.
[00:14:00.520 --> 00:14:03.160]   I came and I was on the show with you.
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:04.320]   That was the cross point.
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:06.320]   That was the new cross point memory technology.
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.320]   Yeah.
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:08.320]   And they became Optane.
[00:14:08.320 --> 00:14:09.920]   HP and just shipped a new laptop.
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:12.360]   And I actually have it, but I don't know what processor it has.
[00:14:12.360 --> 00:14:14.120]   I haven't cranked it open yet.
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:16.000]   It'll be KB Lake or coffee lake, right?
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:18.600]   Yeah, but I mean, they're, they've got some beautiful laptops.
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:19.600]   I think, yeah.
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:26.200]   I mean, I mean, also, let's not forget, Spectre and Meltdown and even the, you know, the chips
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:32.760]   that you're getting from Intel today are vulnerable to these, you know, issues.
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:38.480]   And there's, to my knowledge, still three Spectre flaws that have not yet been disclosed.
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:42.280]   The newest one was disclosed and presumably patched, but there's three more we don't
[00:14:42.280 --> 00:14:43.280]   know about.
[00:14:43.280 --> 00:14:45.760]   I mean, this is just bad news, bad news, bad news, bad news.
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:47.640]   So you can see the Apple mic.
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:49.480]   I do credit you, Greg, with one thing.
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:51.760]   You can see why Apple might say, screw it.
[00:14:51.760 --> 00:14:54.800]   We, you know, and by the way, these aren't even really arm chips.
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:15:00.960]   These are Apple A chips that are licensed arm architecture, but they do a lot of stuff.
[00:15:00.960 --> 00:15:01.960]   They've done a lot of stuff.
[00:15:01.960 --> 00:15:03.520]   Mostly what they've done is refocus the die.
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:07.960]   So a lot of the arm cores are the same and they do a lot of optimization.
[00:15:07.960 --> 00:15:12.840]   So especially around the memory buses, if I remember rightly and also to get a more of
[00:15:12.840 --> 00:15:15.360]   them on the die anyway, lots of tricks and things that you can do.
[00:15:15.360 --> 00:15:19.520]   But fundamentally, it's a base arm architecture at the best they can tweak it at the edges
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:23.880]   and integrate the bus, the fastest bus architectures to the GPUs that they put in them and all
[00:15:23.880 --> 00:15:24.960]   that sort of stuff.
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:25.960]   So that's fine.
[00:15:25.960 --> 00:15:31.960]   But I keep in mind that Apple only wants to make one notebook, unlike HPE and Dell, who
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:36.680]   will happily make 10,000 of one notebook or 20,000 of one notebook and then ship it with
[00:15:36.680 --> 00:15:39.760]   a custom screw just so that Best Buy has a unique one.
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:43.400]   You know, that fiddle that like when you go to the shop to buy fridges and they say,
[00:15:43.400 --> 00:15:45.800]   I will have the cheapest price on this fridge anywhere.
[00:15:45.800 --> 00:15:48.840]   And that's because they're the only one with that model number because it's a unique model
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:49.840]   number to them.
[00:15:49.840 --> 00:15:51.480]   That's why you can't shop them, right?
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:55.000]   And so this is what HPE and Dell do in the retail channels and they do with enterprise
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   as well.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:59.560]   They'll produce 10,000 of this and 20,000 of that and 50,000 of this.
[00:15:59.560 --> 00:16:00.560]   Apple won't do that.
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:02.080]   Apple wants to do one run.
[00:16:02.080 --> 00:16:06.360]   It wants to do, you know, a million units or two million units over a life cycle.
[00:16:06.360 --> 00:16:11.880]   They'll take one chip like they've done with the Skylake from 2015 or the KV Lake and just
[00:16:11.880 --> 00:16:13.560]   keep running it out the door.
[00:16:13.560 --> 00:16:17.520]   And every now and then you get a bump, but they don't futz around with, you know, breaking
[00:16:17.520 --> 00:16:20.960]   up their production schedules to be able to accommodate a new chip and a new controller
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:21.960]   and a new memory.
[00:16:21.960 --> 00:16:26.080]   And I suspect my sense of this, and this is just me, my gut feel.
[00:16:26.080 --> 00:16:29.960]   I'm not on the inside to like Seth is, is that Apple's come up with several designs
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.960]   based on Intel's commitments to them about the production.
[00:16:32.960 --> 00:16:34.120]   Intel hasn't been able to deliver.
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:35.560]   And so they've just pulled out.
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:39.920]   But because Apple doesn't communicate with its audience, it doesn't share what it's
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:40.920]   doing.
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:41.920]   It doesn't give people.
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:42.920]   We don't know.
[00:16:42.920 --> 00:16:43.920]   We don't know.
[00:16:43.920 --> 00:16:44.920]   We have no idea.
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:46.920]   But the question I have to ask is who really care, aside from, you know, the people who
[00:16:46.920 --> 00:16:51.720]   are designing rocket ships and, you know, the, the, the geeks, does the average person
[00:16:51.720 --> 00:16:57.360]   really need or care whether they have a 2013 or 2016 processor in their laptop?
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:02.520]   I mean, how many people really complain that their processor is too slow on their, on their
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:03.520]   PC?
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:04.520]   I don't hear that much.
[00:17:04.520 --> 00:17:06.520]   I know a lot of video professionals kind of.
[00:17:06.520 --> 00:17:07.520]   Yeah, there's a niche.
[00:17:07.520 --> 00:17:08.520]   There are niches.
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:14.600]   Photographers, videographers, rocket chip designers.
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:18.000]   But that's who buys, but I hate to say it, but that's who buys Max coder.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:19.840]   I have to say coders too.
[00:17:19.840 --> 00:17:22.520]   Coders are very sensitive to compile times.
[00:17:22.520 --> 00:17:28.360]   If you had a six core processor and you had a threaded compiler, that makes a huge difference.
[00:17:28.360 --> 00:17:35.400]   And so that, that cycle that, you know, right compile, build, run cycle the faster that
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:37.600]   goes, the better they are.
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:42.680]   So there are what it is is it's the people Apple should be and has traditionally cultivated,
[00:17:42.680 --> 00:17:44.420]   which is the professional market.
[00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:47.200]   It doesn't seem like they're doing much for the professional market.
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:53.320]   I have that iMac Pro and to your point, exactly Larry, for 90% of what I do, it's no faster
[00:17:53.320 --> 00:17:58.800]   than my 2015 MacBook Pro because you have to have software that's tuned to use.
[00:17:58.800 --> 00:18:01.720]   I have 10 cores, nine of which do nothing.
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:04.440]   I'm not even at a video.
[00:18:04.440 --> 00:18:09.760]   So I carried my one minute podcast every day into a video and I don't even remember.
[00:18:09.760 --> 00:18:12.040]   I've got a i5 processor on this.
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:14.340]   But there's a short course, right?
[00:18:14.340 --> 00:18:16.220]   It takes seconds to render.
[00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:17.980]   I suppose that they were long videos.
[00:18:17.980 --> 00:18:24.820]   Trust me, if you're doing, you know, I got the Go Profusion 360 camera, takes eight hours
[00:18:24.820 --> 00:18:28.540]   to render that video on an attend core iMac Pro.
[00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:33.820]   Yes, there are things you do and people do, a lot of people do, pros do that do need that
[00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:34.820]   power.
[00:18:34.820 --> 00:18:36.660]   It's more than just the CPU though.
[00:18:36.660 --> 00:18:40.460]   Stop focusing on the engine and start thinking about the gearbox and the suspension.
[00:18:40.460 --> 00:18:45.380]   The new generation of Intel's will support faster SSD buses.
[00:18:45.380 --> 00:18:47.420]   Hopefully we'll see some NVMe, maybe a faster.
[00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:49.400]   Does Optane make a difference?
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:51.460]   Optane, I think, is a big difference.
[00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:57.020]   And I think from Apple, if you think about this idea of 3D NAND replacing memory and
[00:18:57.020 --> 00:19:02.220]   SSDs or acting as a cache in the architecture, should drive power consumption way down, in
[00:19:02.220 --> 00:19:04.020]   my opinion.
[00:19:04.020 --> 00:19:05.020]   And so instead of having a 10-hour--
[00:19:05.020 --> 00:19:07.020]   That's another spec that's very important.
[00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:08.020]   Power consumption.
[00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:09.020]   Right, yeah.
[00:19:09.020 --> 00:19:10.020]   Apple.
[00:19:10.020 --> 00:19:14.820]   The CPU's, although the extra performance would be good, there's also a whole bunch of modernization
[00:19:14.820 --> 00:19:18.380]   around how the CPU interface is to the rest of the equipment.
[00:19:18.380 --> 00:19:23.700]   So SSDs, Optane memory, new DIMMs, new DIM architectures that are more power efficient
[00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:28.340]   using smaller processors so they're consuming us power.
[00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:32.260]   And it's all of that stuff, which is actually what we don't need the CPU.
[00:19:32.260 --> 00:19:36.180]   But if you can get data in and out of the CPU faster, or get deeper L3 buffers or whatever
[00:19:36.180 --> 00:19:39.940]   the current generation of features are in Islaik, then that's actually going to be
[00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:41.140]   going to drive your experience.
[00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:44.740]   Everything feels snappier, even though you're still running at the same clock speed.
[00:19:44.740 --> 00:19:45.740]   And that's what we want.
[00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:46.740]   We can't--
[00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:47.740]   But I can't--
[00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:48.740]   We want that better.
[00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:52.700]   You've given me some hope, because I really felt like Apple has abandoned the Pro market.
[00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:58.500]   But what may well be the fact is Apple knows that, well, when we can get an Optane system
[00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:04.940]   and when we can get maybe a six-core processor, this will be a Pro system worthy of calling
[00:20:04.940 --> 00:20:05.940]   a Mac Pro.
[00:20:05.940 --> 00:20:07.940]   That's why that's not going to be available till next year.
[00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:12.620]   Well, look at how popular external GPUs are with the enthusiast market.
[00:20:12.620 --> 00:20:14.980]   Everybody's getting a Mac iMac and they're hanging off.
[00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:18.620]   And there's any number of YouTube articles of people hanging these external GPUs to get
[00:20:18.620 --> 00:20:19.620]   the features that they want.
[00:20:19.620 --> 00:20:23.140]   Because they have such anemic GPUs in the current crop.
[00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:24.140]   And what's in the processor?
[00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:27.580]   The GPUs built onto the CPU die, right?
[00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:32.260]   Or they're using a generation of GPU from five years ago, then the bus speed between
[00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:34.020]   the CPU and the GPU is too slow.
[00:20:34.020 --> 00:20:37.780]   That's why we want the new generation of CPUs that Intel hasn't delivered and isn't going
[00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:38.780]   to.
[00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:42.660]   So that's why I don't think we'll see hardware if Apple, and I think it's too early for Apple
[00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:47.380]   to do arms, but I'm perfectly confident that Apple sitting there in front of Intel saying
[00:20:47.380 --> 00:20:52.500]   getting six months closer to an ARM CPU, better get your finger out.
[00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:53.500]   Yeah.
[00:20:53.500 --> 00:20:57.180]   Zach, there's other things that they could update as well.
[00:20:57.180 --> 00:21:01.940]   We saw recently a new Huawei laptop with a kind of edge to edge screen.
[00:21:01.940 --> 00:21:04.060]   Isn't that a gorgeous laptop?
[00:21:04.060 --> 00:21:05.060]   What is it, the Honor?
[00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:09.620]   I'm not sold on the camera coming out of the keyboard thing, but everything else looked
[00:21:09.620 --> 00:21:10.820]   pretty good.
[00:21:10.820 --> 00:21:14.300]   And then, as you said, oh, yeah, the mate.
[00:21:14.300 --> 00:21:26.500]   And then the ports on MacBook, they could add microSD slot or, god forbid, a USB-A port
[00:21:26.500 --> 00:21:27.500]   or...
[00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:29.300]   There's a lot of things they can do.
[00:21:29.300 --> 00:21:33.660]   I don't think that's going to happen, but I feel like there's a lot of things they can
[00:21:33.660 --> 00:21:37.260]   do to get a new laptop out before...
[00:21:37.260 --> 00:21:43.420]   Before they do is futz with the keyboard and a few slots and edge to edge screen, people
[00:21:43.420 --> 00:21:45.220]   are going to howl.
[00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:46.220]   Yep.
[00:21:46.220 --> 00:21:49.860]   People are just going to whine and say, why is this not fun?
[00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:54.420]   The chief nerds, the loudmouth, the people like us who think we're just all going to
[00:21:54.420 --> 00:21:56.180]   say, why did they even bother?
[00:21:56.180 --> 00:22:00.420]   So they're screwed either way they go because they're not willing to be open and say, this
[00:22:00.420 --> 00:22:01.420]   is what we're doing.
[00:22:01.420 --> 00:22:02.420]   This is where we're heading.
[00:22:02.420 --> 00:22:05.860]   If they could just stand up and say, this is the problem with bringing out a new laptop
[00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:12.140]   and be honest about it, instead of trying to come out with the trashcan, Mac Pro type
[00:22:12.140 --> 00:22:14.100]   mistakes that they've made.
[00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:16.260]   And I wonder if they'll ever come out with a touchscreen Mac.
[00:22:16.260 --> 00:22:17.260]   No.
[00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:18.260]   And that's something that...
[00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:20.180]   I think they've been very unequivocal in saying no.
[00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:21.700]   Do you agree, Seth?
[00:22:21.700 --> 00:22:26.580]   I think the touchscreen Mac will be a iOS device that has a keyboard.
[00:22:26.580 --> 00:22:27.580]   Yep.
[00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:28.580]   Right.
[00:22:28.580 --> 00:22:31.740]   I don't think the Mac line will ever go there.
[00:22:31.740 --> 00:22:32.740]   Yeah.
[00:22:32.740 --> 00:22:33.740]   No.
[00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:34.740]   This is the new Mate.
[00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:37.900]   Look how thin it is.
[00:22:37.900 --> 00:22:38.900]   I mean...
[00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:40.700]   Yeah, I mean it looks exactly like a MacBook.
[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:41.700]   Right.
[00:22:41.700 --> 00:22:44.660]   So why can't Apple make that screen?
[00:22:44.660 --> 00:22:45.660]   It's a great question.
[00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:46.660]   Wow.
[00:22:46.660 --> 00:22:47.660]   Yeah.
[00:22:47.660 --> 00:22:48.660]   What's the power?
[00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:49.660]   What does it eat a battery life on that guy?
[00:22:49.660 --> 00:22:52.940]   You don't ask questions like that, Larry.
[00:22:52.940 --> 00:22:55.540]   You just plunk down the credit card.
[00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:56.660]   What's the battery life?
[00:22:56.660 --> 00:22:58.220]   What the hell you care about that?
[00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:07.860]   Tomorrow when I'm at the WWDC and it's three hours into it and there's no power outlet,
[00:23:07.860 --> 00:23:10.020]   I'm going to care about the battery life.
[00:23:10.020 --> 00:23:11.020]   Yeah.
[00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:12.020]   Let me see.
[00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:13.020]   Where does it come out of the...
[00:23:13.020 --> 00:23:14.020]   Come out of the...
[00:23:14.020 --> 00:23:15.020]   Let me see if I can find it.
[00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:17.020]   Comes out of the F6 key or something crazy.
[00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:19.020]   Yeah, so silly.
[00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:20.020]   It's so thin.
[00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:24.540]   The Connective Connectors does have a regular USB slot which is interesting as well as two
[00:23:24.540 --> 00:23:25.540]   type Cs.
[00:23:25.540 --> 00:23:27.260]   It can be done.
[00:23:27.260 --> 00:23:29.740]   I7 processor.
[00:23:29.740 --> 00:23:31.900]   It's the 855.50U.
[00:23:31.900 --> 00:23:35.780]   That's not a bad processor at the top of the line.
[00:23:35.780 --> 00:23:39.780]   Discrete graphics card available if you wish.
[00:23:39.780 --> 00:23:42.380]   57.4 watt hour battery.
[00:23:42.380 --> 00:23:43.380]   That's a big one.
[00:23:43.380 --> 00:23:44.380]   12 hours in video.
[00:23:44.380 --> 00:23:45.380]   That is impressive.
[00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:46.380]   That's impressive.
[00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:47.380]   That's a big battery.
[00:23:47.380 --> 00:23:50.140]   Not the only other question I can't afford to ask is how much it costs.
[00:23:50.140 --> 00:23:51.780]   Oh, there's the camera.
[00:23:51.780 --> 00:23:52.780]   There it is.
[00:23:52.780 --> 00:23:53.780]   Hello.
[00:23:53.780 --> 00:23:54.780]   Hello.
[00:23:54.780 --> 00:23:55.780]   That's weird.
[00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:56.780]   Hello.
[00:23:56.780 --> 00:24:01.020]   The bottom of your neck is going to be the star of your video.
[00:24:01.020 --> 00:24:02.020]   Wow.
[00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:03.180]   That's a non-starter for that one.
[00:24:03.180 --> 00:24:05.420]   Are you wearing gold chains?
[00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:06.420]   That's all I see.
[00:24:06.420 --> 00:24:08.820]   Oh, it's a guy with a man bun.
[00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:10.820]   So what does he care, right?
[00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:14.500]   He's a very assertive guy with a man bun.
[00:24:14.500 --> 00:24:17.540]   Actually, he's just pointing that stylist like he means it.
[00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:19.020]   They all have man buns.
[00:24:19.020 --> 00:24:20.940]   What the hell's going on with the hair here?
[00:24:20.940 --> 00:24:22.860]   What are these people?
[00:24:22.860 --> 00:24:23.860]   You're going to end up with this...
[00:24:23.860 --> 00:24:26.740]   There's a thing going on on social media at the moment of bearded men.
[00:24:26.740 --> 00:24:29.300]   Looking straight up and then they're taking photos of themselves.
[00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:31.100]   It's the most disturbing thing.
[00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:32.460]   I put a link into the chat screen.
[00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:34.180]   What's under that beard?
[00:24:34.180 --> 00:24:35.180]   Yeah.
[00:24:35.180 --> 00:24:40.140]   No, they put the heads right back and then take a photo of themselves from around Adam's
[00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:41.140]   apple.
[00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:42.140]   This is interesting.
[00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:43.140]   This is interesting.
[00:24:43.140 --> 00:24:45.980]   I mean, that's a problem with a 91% screen.
[00:24:45.980 --> 00:24:46.980]   There's nowhere to put the camera.
[00:24:46.980 --> 00:24:50.260]   HP put it right at the bottom.
[00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:51.820]   Remember on the left there.
[00:24:51.820 --> 00:24:53.380]   I love the name of meat book.
[00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:54.380]   That's a lovely...
[00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:55.380]   Meat book.
[00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:58.380]   Kind of like Mac book, but not really.
[00:24:58.380 --> 00:25:00.660]   Full-size backlit, chicklet keyboard.
[00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:02.180]   At least they say it's a chicklet.
[00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:04.980]   They admit it.
[00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:05.980]   It doesn't look...
[00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:08.260]   The federal government let us buy these because they're made in China.
[00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:09.260]   No, it's not.
[00:25:09.260 --> 00:25:10.260]   It's while away.
[00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:11.260]   It doesn't actually look a lot...
[00:25:11.260 --> 00:25:13.460]   Oh, it's got a fingerprint reader.
[00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:16.940]   Does look a lot like a Mac book, doesn't it?
[00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:18.540]   Too bad it has to run Windows.
[00:25:18.540 --> 00:25:20.500]   Well, they all run the same chips.
[00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:23.540]   They all want to have to look the same at the end of the day because they all run the
[00:25:23.540 --> 00:25:24.820]   same chips.
[00:25:24.820 --> 00:25:26.220]   They all run the same processors.
[00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:28.500]   They all run the same screens.
[00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:32.420]   The only innovation that Apple got when they did their first generation was there's the
[00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:37.060]   aluminium for the body where everybody else was still making plastic so that they could
[00:25:37.060 --> 00:25:40.780]   rip customers off by giving them a cheap, shoddy product.
[00:25:40.780 --> 00:25:41.780]   And Apple sort of said, "No, no, no.
[00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:45.380]   If we gave them an aluminium case, we could do something better."
[00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:49.100]   And then of course people realized that actually aluminium cases were a good idea.
[00:25:49.100 --> 00:25:52.780]   Apple had made the market because the challenge was with aluminium was, "How do you mill
[00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:53.780]   it?"
[00:25:53.780 --> 00:25:56.820]   It wasn't anybody with machines that let you mill aluminium.
[00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:58.700]   It was much cheaper.
[00:25:58.700 --> 00:26:03.060]   In fact, you could only extrude plastic to make this case that you want.
[00:26:03.060 --> 00:26:07.100]   And so Apple gets out there, starts buying up these aluminium milling machines and lo
[00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:09.580]   and behold aluminium cases become standard.
[00:26:09.580 --> 00:26:11.740]   So that's the iteration there.
[00:26:11.740 --> 00:26:13.140]   Pricing is good on this, by the way.
[00:26:13.140 --> 00:26:17.940]   The MacBook X Pro i5 with 8GB of RAM and 256GB SSD.
[00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:18.940]   That's good.
[00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:19.940]   It's good.
[00:26:19.940 --> 00:26:22.940]   $1,200 and out of stock.
[00:26:22.940 --> 00:26:25.420]   The company in the chair are saying that this is not a Chinese company.
[00:26:25.420 --> 00:26:26.700]   It's from Taiwan.
[00:26:26.700 --> 00:26:27.700]   So that...
[00:26:27.700 --> 00:26:28.700]   Really?
[00:26:28.700 --> 00:26:29.700]   That's okay.
[00:26:29.700 --> 00:26:30.700]   Huawei?
[00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:31.700]   Yeah.
[00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:32.700]   I thought they were Chinese.
[00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:33.700]   But I guess not.
[00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:34.700]   I didn't surprise that.
[00:26:34.700 --> 00:26:35.700]   That surprised me.
[00:26:35.700 --> 00:26:39.660]   By the way, you got to love the tagline for this.
[00:26:39.660 --> 00:26:42.380]   The best laptop you've never heard of.
[00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:47.700]   I'm pretty sure that Huawei is a Chinese company.
[00:26:47.700 --> 00:26:49.180]   That's what I thought too.
[00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:54.020]   We've had people from our team go to China to attend their conferences.
[00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:56.900]   I think they may have an office in Taiwan and maybe even their head office.
[00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:01.060]   They may be raising capital out of Taiwan, but I'm not fairly confident they're not.
[00:27:01.060 --> 00:27:02.420]   Let me just check their website.
[00:27:02.420 --> 00:27:11.380]   Well, they say they operate in 170 countries and serve more than a third of humanity.
[00:27:11.380 --> 00:27:12.380]   They made the 6...
[00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:13.380]   That's right.
[00:27:13.380 --> 00:27:14.380]   They made the Nexus 6p.
[00:27:14.380 --> 00:27:15.380]   I forgot about that.
[00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:16.380]   I'm trying to find their...
[00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:18.500]   I have a broken Huawei phone right here.
[00:27:18.500 --> 00:27:21.660]   It's actually at honor, but I think Huawei makes the honor.
[00:27:21.660 --> 00:27:23.660]   Yeah, I think it's made in China.
[00:27:23.660 --> 00:27:32.180]   Recently, AT&T and Verizon didn't sell Huawei phones because the US government convinced
[00:27:32.180 --> 00:27:33.860]   them behind the scenes not to.
[00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:36.820]   So I feel like that's China.
[00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:37.820]   That's right.
[00:27:37.820 --> 00:27:42.420]   They were all set to get into AT&T and Verizon and then the plug was pulled.
[00:27:42.420 --> 00:27:43.820]   That's right.
[00:27:43.820 --> 00:27:44.820]   Yeah.
[00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:46.060]   Ted quoted in Shenzhen Guangdong.
[00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:48.060]   There you go.
[00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:52.500]   So that's why I should never listen to the chatroom.
[00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:55.980]   No, I think he's...
[00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:58.060]   There's a lot of stuff that comes out of Taiwan.
[00:27:58.060 --> 00:27:59.540]   It's very difficult to depict the difference between...
[00:27:59.540 --> 00:28:03.980]   I always have to go and look these things up, but it's very much a Chinese arm of the
[00:28:03.980 --> 00:28:05.620]   government.
[00:28:05.620 --> 00:28:08.780]   As somebody's saying, the chatroom, Huawei was founded by a former engineer from the
[00:28:08.780 --> 00:28:10.780]   PLA, the Chinese arm.
[00:28:10.780 --> 00:28:11.780]   Chinese arm.
[00:28:11.780 --> 00:28:12.780]   That's okay.
[00:28:12.780 --> 00:28:15.860]   Everything that comes out of Israel's X-arm forces, so don't get too panicked.
[00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:18.860]   So WWDC tomorrow will be really...
[00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:19.860]   It's funny.
[00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:22.020]   I was looking back at last year.
[00:28:22.020 --> 00:28:28.100]   They announced the HomePod, shipped it almost a year later.
[00:28:28.100 --> 00:28:33.900]   They announced AirPlay 2, shipped it almost exactly a year later, last week.
[00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:41.940]   They announced iCloud messages, Apple messages in iCloud, shipped that last week, and the
[00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:42.940]   IMac Pro.
[00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:43.940]   They did have some hardware.
[00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:44.940]   They had the IMac Pro.
[00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:50.340]   They did the iPad Pro, 10.5, maybe not, but the IMac Pro, they shipped there.
[00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:51.980]   So they did announce some hardware.
[00:28:51.980 --> 00:28:54.460]   Didn't get a lot of it out for a long time.
[00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:57.300]   Yeah, they've been known to announce hardware at WWDC.
[00:28:57.300 --> 00:29:00.380]   A lot of times you hear people say, "It's a developer's conference.
[00:29:00.380 --> 00:29:02.140]   It should be software only."
[00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:06.540]   But throughout their history, they've released tons of hardware at WWDC.
[00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:11.780]   Not even specifically necessarily developer hardware.
[00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:13.100]   This is a bully pulpit.
[00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:15.500]   A lot of people are paying attention.
[00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:17.660]   Why not use this to announce something?
[00:29:17.660 --> 00:29:20.220]   Yeah, and the March event wasn't that exciting.
[00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:21.580]   It was mostly education.
[00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:25.620]   So, you know, and if I were going to...
[00:29:25.620 --> 00:29:33.900]   Yeah, so it's already been half a year now, and Apple hasn't released anything.
[00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:39.020]   It's been more like eight months since the last iPhone announcement.
[00:29:39.020 --> 00:29:41.980]   My audience mostly hear of it when they do the iPhone announcement.
[00:29:41.980 --> 00:29:42.980]   Yes.
[00:29:42.980 --> 00:29:46.300]   And people get excited when the iPhone comes out.
[00:29:46.300 --> 00:29:47.300]   I'm not.
[00:29:47.300 --> 00:29:48.300]   I'm not.
[00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:49.300]   I'm not.
[00:29:49.300 --> 00:29:50.300]   My audience is not the only one.
[00:29:50.300 --> 00:29:53.300]   They all use the fact that the phone they should hear.
[00:29:53.300 --> 00:29:54.300]   No, I'm just...
[00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:56.740]   So, your audience is normal people is the point.
[00:29:56.740 --> 00:29:57.740]   They're normal people.
[00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:00.780]   What could they announce in hardware that would actually move the needle?
[00:30:00.780 --> 00:30:06.740]   Like the difference between the iPhone this year to last year is about 5% better.
[00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:10.620]   You know, arguably the performance is a bit better, but I don't think people notice.
[00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:16.380]   The effect of face recognition is, you know, the camera, you know, the multiple cameras.
[00:30:16.380 --> 00:30:18.100]   Everybody's got that now.
[00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:19.700]   You know, if they come out with the...
[00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:24.460]   There's an article here from Mac Room is talking about triple lens cameras.
[00:30:24.460 --> 00:30:27.300]   You know, like again, good to have.
[00:30:27.300 --> 00:30:28.300]   Nice to have.
[00:30:28.300 --> 00:30:34.460]   I will say that was source from an analyst who seemed like he was guessing.
[00:30:34.460 --> 00:30:38.340]   It was a Chinese report.
[00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:43.220]   And it was saying something like, you know, if you read the Chinese part of it, it was
[00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:46.420]   like things that could happen, but we have no idea.
[00:30:46.420 --> 00:30:49.460]   And so we didn't run with that particular story.
[00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:53.380]   I think Apple's doubling down on software driven photography.
[00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:59.420]   They're saying that if I use smarts, like the portrait mode in the iPhone 8 that I have
[00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:00.780]   is just extraordinary.
[00:31:00.780 --> 00:31:02.020]   But that's not a lens.
[00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:07.060]   That's not me changing from a, you know, 50 mil, nifty 50 to a 24 millimeter lens or something
[00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:08.060]   like that.
[00:31:08.060 --> 00:31:13.020]   So I put the phone up and the software doesn't processing and boom, I've got a portrait mode.
[00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:16.540]   I think we're going to see much more in the software and much less improvement on the
[00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:17.540]   hardware.
[00:31:17.540 --> 00:31:18.540]   Where do they go?
[00:31:18.540 --> 00:31:19.540]   What do they do?
[00:31:19.540 --> 00:31:23.220]   Put a bigger, bigger, faster CPU in with a better GPU and more memory.
[00:31:23.220 --> 00:31:24.220]   I mean...
[00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:26.460]   Actually, I think it has the same problem with the software.
[00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:27.460]   It's hard.
[00:31:27.460 --> 00:31:28.460]   It's hard.
[00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:29.460]   We're such peak...
[00:31:29.460 --> 00:31:30.460]   Yeah.
[00:31:30.460 --> 00:31:31.460]   ...fall-own at this point.
[00:31:31.460 --> 00:31:33.740]   It's hard to think of what you would do to make the software significantly.
[00:31:33.740 --> 00:31:37.340]   I mean, it's sort of like... look at Microsoft, which, you know, until recently with only
[00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:44.860]   a software company, they go from office X to office X is Y. And I, you know, I'm a heavy
[00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:49.620]   office user and I can barely tell the difference between the current version.
[00:31:49.620 --> 00:31:51.100]   The version came out 12 50 years ago.
[00:31:51.100 --> 00:31:52.660]   We're kind of at that point now.
[00:31:52.660 --> 00:31:56.380]   You know, you just get to a point where it's so close to perfect.
[00:31:56.380 --> 00:31:57.380]   You guys...
[00:31:57.380 --> 00:32:02.380]   Seth, you guys at 9 to 5 Mac had... actually, Stephen Troughton Smith posted it and then
[00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:05.100]   you guys posted the video, which Apple immediately...
[00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:11.180]   Yeah, even it's streamable, which is like, you know, the NBA can't get stuff down from
[00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:12.180]   streamable and...
[00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:13.180]   Pulled it down, maybe.
[00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:17.260]   Pulled it down to the quick shift like at like AM in the morning.
[00:32:17.260 --> 00:32:21.500]   Yeah, fortunately, there were some screenshots and it looks like the big feature which Apple
[00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:26.500]   will announce tomorrow for Mac OS 1014.
[00:32:26.500 --> 00:32:32.300]   You guys maybe thought it might be Mojave because there seems to be dunes on the screen
[00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:35.020]   in the background, Mac OS 10 Mojave.
[00:32:35.020 --> 00:32:37.700]   The big feature will be dark mode.
[00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:40.700]   You know, the people love the dark mode.
[00:32:40.700 --> 00:32:45.260]   Yeah, but really, how much programming time does it take to do dark mode?
[00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:47.020]   I believe that's a bit.
[00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:48.020]   I'm thinking it's just a bit...
[00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:49.980]   First of all, colors.
[00:32:49.980 --> 00:32:54.580]   You got to do all the colors new.
[00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:56.340]   And Apple News will be on the...
[00:32:56.340 --> 00:32:59.460]   Apple News will be on the desktop now.
[00:32:59.460 --> 00:33:00.460]   That's...
[00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:02.820]   Yeah, that's nothing to jump up in that about at all.
[00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:04.420]   What about augmented reality?
[00:33:04.420 --> 00:33:08.460]   I mean, personally augmented reality to me is a bit of a yawn.
[00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:10.300]   It's going to be like 3D TVs.
[00:33:10.300 --> 00:33:13.620]   I think it's going to be like a decade before that comes anywhere.
[00:33:13.620 --> 00:33:17.100]   But do you think Apple's going to try and do a song and dance around AR and then pretend
[00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:19.700]   that it actually matters?
[00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:22.300]   I think they will try to do a song and dance around AR.
[00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:26.740]   I think that's kind of what they're focusing on right now.
[00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:34.180]   We've seen where you point your camera around, even at Google I/O last month, Google demonstrated
[00:33:34.180 --> 00:33:35.180]   a bunch of cool stuff.
[00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:39.460]   They added AR to the apps, which is actually a useful feature.
[00:33:39.460 --> 00:33:40.460]   Very useful.
[00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:41.460]   Yeah.
[00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:43.940]   So I think Apple's not going to seed the lead in AR.
[00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:51.540]   And there was that Reuters report about end-to-end AR stuff where you're sharing an AR screen
[00:33:51.540 --> 00:33:55.660]   with somebody else and it's not bouncing off any servers.
[00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:57.580]   So I think there's some room to improve there.
[00:33:57.580 --> 00:34:00.300]   There's some room to be creative and show some really cool stuff.
[00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:08.260]   I don't think Apple's going to seed that AR lead they have to Google anytime soon.
[00:34:08.260 --> 00:34:12.260]   And that may even affect their hardware in the short term with the camera.
[00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:18.420]   But to me the big question is, is AR going to be a headset player that's going to be
[00:34:18.420 --> 00:34:22.660]   something that just is augmented with the screens of whatever flat device you're carrying
[00:34:22.660 --> 00:34:24.460]   in your pocket or in your backpack?
[00:34:24.460 --> 00:34:31.500]   I mean, I just came back from AWE, which is an augmented world expo.
[00:34:31.500 --> 00:34:35.220]   And I saw a lot of products that did not require a headset.
[00:34:35.220 --> 00:34:39.740]   They just ran off of phones and tablets.
[00:34:39.740 --> 00:34:43.260]   In a way that's really what Apple did a year ago at WWDC.
[00:34:43.260 --> 00:34:46.540]   They announced ARKit and they showed a lot of apps with it.
[00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:52.700]   And ironically it didn't use the fancy array facing you that would have made a much better
[00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:54.300]   AR tool set.
[00:34:54.300 --> 00:34:56.620]   They used just a regular camera on the back.
[00:34:56.620 --> 00:35:02.380]   Google, which had a very fancy elaborate hardware based AR platform called Tango, took
[00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:07.860]   one look at the success Apple had with this kind of bogus ARKit because stuff doesn't
[00:35:07.860 --> 00:35:09.900]   quite sit on the surface.
[00:35:09.900 --> 00:35:11.060]   It's okay.
[00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:12.060]   It's adequate.
[00:35:12.060 --> 00:35:15.900]   And they said, oh crap, Tango was, no, we wasted all that time.
[00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:21.380]   So they made AR Core, which is basically an Android version of ARKit.
[00:35:21.380 --> 00:35:22.460]   And I agree with you, Greg.
[00:35:22.460 --> 00:35:31.620]   I think what we're seeing, the AR we're seeing today is to headset based real AR, HoloLens
[00:35:31.620 --> 00:35:37.580]   like real AR, as today's artificial intelligence is to hell 9,000.
[00:35:37.580 --> 00:35:43.140]   I mean, it is a long, I think real AR is a long way off.
[00:35:43.140 --> 00:35:48.700]   And that's acknowledgement from the companies, Apple and Google chiefly, they got nothing.
[00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:50.700]   So they're going to do this.
[00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:54.740]   Yeah, a lot of the times these Silicon Valley companies like to tie their shoelaces and then
[00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:57.620]   trip over themselves.
[00:35:57.620 --> 00:36:01.060]   Their idea of being useful is to do something and then pretend it's awesome.
[00:36:01.060 --> 00:36:02.300]   And then everybody ignores them.
[00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:07.660]   They go, well, he did it like my baby and have a good cry like Facebook does every other
[00:36:07.660 --> 00:36:08.980]   week.
[00:36:08.980 --> 00:36:13.180]   I just feel like AR is something that's, it's going to be useful, but nobody actually
[00:36:13.180 --> 00:36:15.140]   knows what it's useful for.
[00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:18.460]   Well, you know, like, look at Google Glass, right?
[00:36:18.460 --> 00:36:21.900]   Google Glass is actually now continues on.
[00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:26.840]   It is a joke for any normal use case, but there are several industries that use Google
[00:36:26.840 --> 00:36:32.220]   Glass for mammoth task, medical in particular, where there's massive stuff actually happening.
[00:36:32.220 --> 00:36:36.620]   And in 10 or 20 years, maybe the Google Glass thing will turn around and come back into
[00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:37.620]   the consumer market.
[00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:40.780]   But I don't know if it'll be that long, but it's at least five years off.
[00:36:40.780 --> 00:36:46.460]   I mean, you have incredible industrial applications, you know, Boeing and airline do you think
[00:36:46.460 --> 00:36:48.460]   it to rearrange the seats on an airliner?
[00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:49.460]   This isn't even that new.
[00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:50.460]   You can look down.
[00:36:50.460 --> 00:36:54.220]   I went to the design labs at Ford eight years ago.
[00:36:54.220 --> 00:36:58.740]   We did coverage and they were using VR helmets to design to look at what it looks like to
[00:36:58.740 --> 00:36:59.740]   be inside a car.
[00:36:59.740 --> 00:37:00.740]   They haven't built yet.
[00:37:00.740 --> 00:37:01.740]   This isn't new.
[00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:04.780]   This is not this has been around forever and ever and ever.
[00:37:04.780 --> 00:37:06.700]   And it's nothing spectacular.
[00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:09.140]   There's a lot of issues have to be solved.
[00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:14.060]   Battery issues, power issues before you can have real augmented reality in a way.
[00:37:14.060 --> 00:37:17.380]   Whether they can build a thing so that they're not obtrusive.
[00:37:17.380 --> 00:37:20.660]   I mean, whether they can be just and essentially add adjuncts to your glass.
[00:37:20.660 --> 00:37:24.780]   Yeah, because that's why Google Glass became a punchline because you looked like a moron.
[00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:25.780]   Right.
[00:37:25.780 --> 00:37:29.420]   Well, we do know that apples were working on our glasses.
[00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:31.260]   Yes, of course they are.
[00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:32.700]   But what's what do you know?
[00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:34.620]   What is the timeframe for that?
[00:37:34.620 --> 00:37:40.580]   I don't know anything specific, but the fact that, you know, Apple's hiring people and,
[00:37:40.580 --> 00:37:44.260]   you know, they're talking internally about it.
[00:37:44.260 --> 00:37:45.620]   I think it's a couple of years away.
[00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:46.620]   That's two or three years.
[00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:49.300]   Tim Cook's been saying ARAR for two years.
[00:37:49.300 --> 00:37:51.900]   You know, he's been really pushing.
[00:37:51.900 --> 00:37:55.420]   Now, but so, so Apple's going to announce you said this, Seth.
[00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:57.900]   I still don't get it.
[00:37:57.900 --> 00:38:01.380]   They're going to let they're going to have tools that let two iPhones share augmented
[00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:05.060]   reality without storing it in the cloud.
[00:38:05.060 --> 00:38:10.540]   I can't wait to hear Larry Magget explain this to people on CPS news radio.
[00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:13.300]   Well, I don't even know what that means myself.
[00:38:13.300 --> 00:38:15.220]   What is that even who wants that?
[00:38:15.220 --> 00:38:16.380]   What do we, what does it mean?
[00:38:16.380 --> 00:38:17.900]   What does it look like?
[00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:20.660]   I think it would appear in a pair of action, right?
[00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:22.620]   No, no, FaceTime with AR.
[00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:24.180]   I don't know.
[00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:29.300]   Oh, you mean that thing where you could put little dog ears in a tongue on your face while
[00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:31.340]   you're talking to somebody that?
[00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:34.980]   Maybe you and emoji FaceTime.
[00:38:34.980 --> 00:38:37.500]   And emoji is quite popular with the day.
[00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:38.780]   Well, I think, is it?
[00:38:38.780 --> 00:38:39.780]   Is it really?
[00:38:39.780 --> 00:38:43.260]   Seth, do you know any kids?
[00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:44.980]   I think they're reaching for a use case.
[00:38:44.980 --> 00:38:50.420]   So if you had your smartphone and you know, you're looking through here, you know, and
[00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:55.660]   looking at a game on a desktop and you're playing it by yourself, that's kind of not
[00:38:55.660 --> 00:38:57.140]   very interesting.
[00:38:57.140 --> 00:38:58.700]   Why not just play a game on a screen?
[00:38:58.700 --> 00:39:03.340]   Why would you map out an AR and watch the all go around and stamp the guy with a wand
[00:39:03.340 --> 00:39:04.340]   or whatever it is.
[00:39:04.340 --> 00:39:08.500]   But if you can get three or four people standing around a table holding their foot again,
[00:39:08.500 --> 00:39:11.420]   you know, when you think about it, if you're holding your phone like this while you're
[00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:13.580]   doing a game, your arms get tired.
[00:39:13.580 --> 00:39:14.900]   That's why we have computers.
[00:39:14.900 --> 00:39:18.460]   So you sit down at a desk and play a game for hours.
[00:39:18.460 --> 00:39:23.420]   And not to mention Pokemon Go, which of course came out with AR without having to get help
[00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:26.300]   from Apple and Android what two years ago.
[00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:28.300]   Well, but it is.
[00:39:28.300 --> 00:39:29.300]   It is and it isn't.
[00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:30.300]   It's a tease of AR.
[00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:34.260]   I mean, they are superimposing computer graphics over the real world.
[00:39:34.260 --> 00:39:36.460]   So I don't know what you call that other than AR.
[00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:37.460]   It's a type of AR.
[00:39:37.460 --> 00:39:39.340]   Primitive AR.
[00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:42.940]   But my picture is putting a picture over the top of your camera.
[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:46.260]   Like the camera image coming on and it just put the Pokemon graphic on top.
[00:39:46.260 --> 00:39:50.500]   It's not like it was, you know, dynamically generated static image on top of the camera.
[00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:53.540]   Honestly, most of the AR kid apps, that's exactly what they're doing.
[00:39:53.540 --> 00:39:54.540]   What it is.
[00:39:54.540 --> 00:39:57.780]   Yeah, no, it's it's not a trivial use case that I just don't.
[00:39:57.780 --> 00:40:00.740]   I think it's you brought this up.
[00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:02.900]   What is phone to phone AR mean?
[00:40:02.900 --> 00:40:05.580]   I don't even know what that means.
[00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:11.020]   So like I said, I don't know what it means, but I imagine that the phone to phone thing
[00:40:11.020 --> 00:40:16.620]   is that so you're doing whatever you're doing and you're worried about the government looking
[00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:21.620]   at it and Apple says, hey, we don't have any knowledge of this because it's phone to
[00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:22.620]   phone.
[00:40:22.620 --> 00:40:23.620]   So don't ask.
[00:40:23.620 --> 00:40:25.020]   You're doing with that government.
[00:40:25.020 --> 00:40:26.260]   I'll acknowledge over.
[00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:27.420]   Why should I go from a camera?
[00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:30.180]   You got ears and a tongue.
[00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:32.940]   And when you open your mouth, rainbows come out.
[00:40:32.940 --> 00:40:36.900]   And I'm really going to be interested in that one.
[00:40:36.900 --> 00:40:38.340]   This sounds really real.
[00:40:38.340 --> 00:40:42.700]   And what's funny is they're all just playing catch up to Snapchat, which has been doing
[00:40:42.700 --> 00:40:43.700]   this for the ages.
[00:40:43.700 --> 00:40:44.700]   Yeah, right.
[00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:45.700]   They've got their own glasses now.
[00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:46.700]   Right.
[00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:51.140]   They've got the second generation of their goggles or would I have my technical goggles?
[00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:53.060]   I still have those spectacles.
[00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:54.460]   They call money.
[00:40:54.460 --> 00:41:00.780]   This article that you refer to Leo sounds like it's just augmented reality shared between
[00:41:00.780 --> 00:41:05.420]   two iPhones is a logical progression of having it on one phone so that more than one person
[00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:06.420]   can play a game.
[00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:07.420]   It's good.
[00:41:07.420 --> 00:41:12.660]   So, but this, but whoever is writing the articles run it through a privacy filter and gone.
[00:41:12.660 --> 00:41:15.380]   It's an anti-Facebook article banging on about privacy.
[00:41:15.380 --> 00:41:16.980]   Like it gives a rats.
[00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:18.580]   What was the event with it?
[00:41:18.580 --> 00:41:23.220]   With it the iPhone event where they showed off some augmented reality games with a recent
[00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:25.580]   Apple event.
[00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:27.740]   This was all at WWDC last year.
[00:41:27.740 --> 00:41:28.740]   Was it that long ago?
[00:41:28.740 --> 00:41:29.740]   Yeah.
[00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:34.620]   So, I mean, there is obviously a gaming application that one could envision that would be a two
[00:41:34.620 --> 00:41:35.620]   iPhone.
[00:41:35.620 --> 00:41:37.220]   It was such a toy.
[00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:42.020]   Every developer, because as soon as they got AR kit wrote their AR app, their Twitter
[00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:45.780]   was filled with these AR kit based apps.
[00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:47.660]   Oh, that's cool.
[00:41:47.660 --> 00:41:49.020]   And then that was that.
[00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:50.020]   It's not.
[00:41:50.020 --> 00:41:51.020]   Yeah.
[00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:52.020]   That was, it was a.
[00:41:52.020 --> 00:41:54.020]   Well, that's how I, you know, I got both of them.
[00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:55.020]   I got both of them.
[00:41:55.020 --> 00:41:56.020]   I got both of them.
[00:41:56.020 --> 00:41:59.460]   It came out recently, the Oculus and the Lenovo.
[00:41:59.460 --> 00:42:03.380]   And I had 15 minutes of fun with each one of them and they've all been on the shelf.
[00:42:03.380 --> 00:42:04.380]   So fun.
[00:42:04.380 --> 00:42:05.380]   That's about all I.
[00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:07.380]   That's the story of the show.
[00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:08.380]   Exactly.
[00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:11.380]   15 minutes of fun, baby.
[00:42:11.380 --> 00:42:17.180]   We're going to take a break and come back with another 15 minutes of fun.
[00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:18.180]   Greg Farro's here.
[00:42:18.180 --> 00:42:19.180]   It's a title.
[00:42:19.180 --> 00:42:22.180]   It's so great to have you, Greg, from a packet pushers network.
[00:42:22.180 --> 00:42:23.180]   Seth Wine, Trump.
[00:42:23.180 --> 00:42:24.180]   First time ever.
[00:42:24.180 --> 00:42:25.180]   Great to have you.
[00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:26.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:42:26.180 --> 00:42:27.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:42:27.180 --> 00:42:28.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:29.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:30.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:42:30.180 --> 00:42:31.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:42:31.180 --> 00:42:32.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:33.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:34.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:42:34.180 --> 00:42:35.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:42:35.180 --> 00:42:36.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:42:36.180 --> 00:42:37.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:42:37.180 --> 00:42:38.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:42:38.180 --> 00:42:39.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:40.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:42:40.180 --> 00:42:41.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:42.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:42:42.180 --> 00:42:43.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:42:43.180 --> 00:42:50.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:57.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:42:57.180 --> 00:43:04.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:43:04.180 --> 00:43:11.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:18.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:43:18.180 --> 00:43:25.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:43:25.180 --> 00:43:32.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:43:32.180 --> 00:43:39.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:43:39.180 --> 00:43:46.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:43:46.180 --> 00:43:53.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:43:53.180 --> 00:44:00.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:44:00.180 --> 00:44:07.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:14.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:21.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:28.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:35.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:44:35.180 --> 00:44:42.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:44:42.180 --> 00:44:49.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:56.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:44:56.180 --> 00:45:03.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:45:03.180 --> 00:45:10.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:45:10.180 --> 00:45:18.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:23.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:45:23.180 --> 00:45:30.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:45:30.180 --> 00:45:37.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:45:37.180 --> 00:45:44.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:51.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:58.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:45:58.180 --> 00:46:05.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:46:05.180 --> 00:46:12.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:19.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:46:19.180 --> 00:46:26.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:46:26.180 --> 00:46:33.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:40.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:46:40.180 --> 00:46:47.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:54.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:46:54.180 --> 00:47:01.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:47:01.180 --> 00:47:09.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:47:09.180 --> 00:47:14.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:47:14.180 --> 00:47:21.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:28.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:35.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:42.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:47:42.180 --> 00:47:49.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:47:49.180 --> 00:47:56.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:47:56.180 --> 00:48:03.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:48:03.180 --> 00:48:10.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:17.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:48:17.180 --> 00:48:24.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:31.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:38.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:48:38.180 --> 00:48:45.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:48:45.180 --> 00:48:52.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:59.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:06.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:13.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:20.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:27.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:34.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:41.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:49:41.180 --> 00:49:48.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:55.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:49:55.180 --> 00:50:02.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:09.180]   I'm going to take a couple of things.
[00:50:09.180 --> 00:50:16.180]   I'm not going to say no.
[00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:22.180]   It's good money in terms of because a handful of kids
[00:50:22.180 --> 00:50:27.180]   sitting around computers whipping up some crazy graphics means it's an enormously profitable business.
[00:50:27.180 --> 00:50:28.180]   It's candy Christaga.
[00:50:28.180 --> 00:50:32.180]   It's actually grandma that's pumping money into that one.
[00:50:32.180 --> 00:50:35.180]   The product that you're generating here is trivial.
[00:50:35.180 --> 00:50:38.180]   The thing that makes me sad is, first of all, it's absolutely trivial.
[00:50:38.180 --> 00:50:39.180]   It's really money.
[00:50:39.180 --> 00:50:40.180]   It's been that way.
[00:50:40.180 --> 00:50:41.180]   Come on.
[00:50:41.180 --> 00:50:42.180]   That's the way the world is.
[00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:44.180]   I'm going to have a bit of a wine.
[00:50:44.180 --> 00:50:49.180]   I'm going to get up here on my hobby horse and ride it around and say, "This is not changing the world.
[00:50:49.180 --> 00:50:51.180]   This is a bunch of people playing stupid games.
[00:50:51.180 --> 00:50:54.180]   They're not improving their lives or brain training."
[00:50:54.180 --> 00:51:00.180]   I mean, brain training was rubbish, but at least people were trying or pretending that they were improving the world of themselves.
[00:51:00.180 --> 00:51:01.180]   They've just given up.
[00:51:01.180 --> 00:51:02.180]   Now they're playing classic lines.
[00:51:02.180 --> 00:51:03.180]   They're just giving up.
[00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:06.180]   They're playing Fortnite or some other stupid thing.
[00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:09.180]   I mean, this isn't really like the...
[00:51:09.180 --> 00:51:12.180]   We're having arguments about how rubbish Facebook is.
[00:51:12.180 --> 00:51:17.180]   If you're mind giving you an issue, you know, in the vat week when he called television the vast wasteland.
[00:51:17.180 --> 00:51:19.180]   Same story, right?
[00:51:19.180 --> 00:51:20.180]   Yeah.
[00:51:20.180 --> 00:51:21.180]   I mean, that's what I'm saying.
[00:51:21.180 --> 00:51:22.180]   It's always been that way.
[00:51:22.180 --> 00:51:26.180]   Mass products, mass appeal products, they're not changing the world.
[00:51:26.180 --> 00:51:27.180]   Yeah.
[00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:28.180]   For crying out loud.
[00:51:28.180 --> 00:51:31.180]   I mean, cup of noodles, come on.
[00:51:31.180 --> 00:51:32.180]   Ramen.
[00:51:32.180 --> 00:51:33.180]   Ramen, come on.
[00:51:33.180 --> 00:51:35.180]   I mean, life has always been that way.
[00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:38.180]   Because cooking food is hard.
[00:51:38.180 --> 00:51:39.180]   Yeah.
[00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:43.180]   Facebook is removing trending topics.
[00:51:43.180 --> 00:51:44.180]   Yeah.
[00:51:44.180 --> 00:51:45.180]   What?
[00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:52.180]   This was the intractable problem they couldn't solve, which was basically the fake news problem, right?
[00:51:52.180 --> 00:51:55.180]   The trending topics, it couldn't be done with humans.
[00:51:55.180 --> 00:52:01.180]   The fake accusations of conservatives that they're with bias and the fact that nobody looks at them to begin with.
[00:52:01.180 --> 00:52:04.180]   I had to go out of my way to remember where they were on my...
[00:52:04.180 --> 00:52:05.180]   Oh, really?
[00:52:05.180 --> 00:52:06.180]   You didn't know.
[00:52:06.180 --> 00:52:08.180]   Whoever looks at those damn things.
[00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:11.180]   Apparently 1.5% of publisher clicks come from trending news.
[00:52:11.180 --> 00:52:12.180]   Well, trending news.
[00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:18.180]   So it's essentially a non-product to begin with that's causing nothing but anguish thanks to all the controversy.
[00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:19.180]   So why not get rid of it?
[00:52:19.180 --> 00:52:23.180]   Yeah, actually, if we hadn't told people it was going away, they may have never...
[00:52:23.180 --> 00:52:24.180]   Exactly.
[00:52:24.180 --> 00:52:25.180]   Never, ever noticed.
[00:52:25.180 --> 00:52:28.180]   Let me just see what's trending today.
[00:52:28.180 --> 00:52:29.180]   Right.
[00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:32.180]   It's on the right, by the way, because you haven't looked at it.
[00:52:32.180 --> 00:52:36.180]   Oops, the page is still building and now it's pushed down here.
[00:52:36.180 --> 00:52:42.180]   Marjorie Stoneman does it with this high school honoring its shooting victims.
[00:52:42.180 --> 00:52:49.180]   Dallas woman says she killed her husband for beating their pet cat and the suspect is arrested after shooting.
[00:52:49.180 --> 00:52:53.180]   And he goes, "And look, a big announcement from Facebook.
[00:52:53.180 --> 00:52:57.180]   We're removing trending news soon to make way for future news.
[00:52:57.180 --> 00:53:02.180]   We're actually destroying your house to make way for a interspace bypass."
[00:53:02.180 --> 00:53:03.180]   Yeah.
[00:53:03.180 --> 00:53:05.180]   Or whatever it was, right?
[00:53:05.180 --> 00:53:06.180]   Yeah.
[00:53:06.180 --> 00:53:08.180]   Nobody's sitting in front of this bulldozer.
[00:53:08.180 --> 00:53:10.180]   I can tell you right now.
[00:53:10.180 --> 00:53:16.180]   I think this is related to the article we've got further down here from Chartbeat.
[00:53:16.180 --> 00:53:19.180]   And Chartbeat is a company that puts analytics inside of web pages.
[00:53:19.180 --> 00:53:26.180]   And what they're now saying is that news sites are now getting more traffic direct on mobile phones
[00:53:26.180 --> 00:53:27.180]   than they are via Facebook.
[00:53:27.180 --> 00:53:34.180]   So over the last five years, we've seen news sites say that they want Facebook to send them traffic.
[00:53:34.180 --> 00:53:38.180]   And what they've realized is they actually just start telling people to come directly to their sites.
[00:53:38.180 --> 00:53:39.180]   People will.
[00:53:39.180 --> 00:53:44.180]   And so now that the split has happened where the majority of people used Facebook to get to news,
[00:53:44.180 --> 00:53:47.180]   now they're going directly to the brand's websites.
[00:53:47.180 --> 00:53:49.180]   And they're all getting very excited about it.
[00:53:49.180 --> 00:53:54.180]   I'm still a heavy Google new view there, especially at my mobile.
[00:53:54.180 --> 00:53:56.180]   I like the new Google.
[00:53:56.180 --> 00:54:00.180]   Be honest with you, the new Google news beats Apple news.
[00:54:00.180 --> 00:54:06.180]   It's actually, if I show you my phone, it's on the front page of my phone.
[00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:07.180]   I really like it.
[00:54:07.180 --> 00:54:09.180]   And their algorithm's a good.
[00:54:09.180 --> 00:54:10.180]   Yeah.
[00:54:10.180 --> 00:54:13.180]   And they're, well, they do something I think is admirable.
[00:54:13.180 --> 00:54:20.180]   And they trumpeted this, if you'll forgive the inadvertent pun, they trumpeted this at Google I/O.
[00:54:20.180 --> 00:54:25.180]   They said, we're going to, there's going to be Leo's briefing.
[00:54:25.180 --> 00:54:29.180]   You know, there's the top five stories for Leo.
[00:54:29.180 --> 00:54:34.180]   But then everything else, the headlines, everybody who reads it will get the same headlines.
[00:54:34.180 --> 00:54:36.180]   Which I think is absolutely essential.
[00:54:36.180 --> 00:54:38.180]   We're not going to do the algorithm on news.
[00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:41.180]   And I think that's actually really admirable.
[00:54:41.180 --> 00:54:42.180]   I agree.
[00:54:42.180 --> 00:54:44.180]   That's probably the real story here is the failure of algorithms.
[00:54:44.180 --> 00:54:45.180]   Yeah.
[00:54:45.180 --> 00:54:50.180]   I call AI, I said AI from now on, it stands for algorithmic idiocy.
[00:54:50.180 --> 00:54:56.180]   The fact is, the idea of tailoring, tailoring news around your biases, basically.
[00:54:56.180 --> 00:54:57.180]   Yeah.
[00:54:57.180 --> 00:54:59.180]   To me, it could go wrong.
[00:54:59.180 --> 00:55:01.180]   It challenged the democracy, right?
[00:55:01.180 --> 00:55:03.180]   You're conservative, you get conservative news.
[00:55:03.180 --> 00:55:05.180]   You're liberal, you get liberal news.
[00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:07.180]   How does that help us resolve any of our problems?
[00:55:07.180 --> 00:55:09.180]   Seth, you probably know better than anybody.
[00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:14.180]   How much, what's the most, what are important traffic drivers for your, your publications?
[00:55:14.180 --> 00:55:18.180]   So in this space, Apple News is clearly a big one.
[00:55:18.180 --> 00:55:21.180]   Flipboard, strangely or not strangely.
[00:55:21.180 --> 00:55:23.180]   Well, flipboard's huge on iOS, right?
[00:55:23.180 --> 00:55:26.180]   I mean, it's on Android, but I think it's huge on iOS.
[00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:27.180]   Right.
[00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:31.180]   And then, you know, obviously Google News and then, you know, all the search, different
[00:55:31.180 --> 00:55:35.180]   search, basically the different ways Google sends traffic.
[00:55:35.180 --> 00:55:39.180]   Facebook is in, and Twitter are both kind of middle ground.
[00:55:39.180 --> 00:55:44.180]   We don't, we don't, we never invested in any kind of Facebook anything.
[00:55:44.180 --> 00:55:48.180]   Because I kind of felt like Facebook wasn't really our buddy.
[00:55:48.180 --> 00:55:49.180]   They didn't really seem like it.
[00:55:49.180 --> 00:55:50.180]   It was very right, weren't you?
[00:55:50.180 --> 00:55:54.180]   You turned out to be right when everybody else chased Facebook.
[00:55:54.180 --> 00:55:55.180]   Yeah.
[00:55:55.180 --> 00:56:01.180]   I mean, Facebook was also handing out a lot of cash to some publishers to work with them.
[00:56:01.180 --> 00:56:04.180]   So, you know, it wasn't, it wasn't dumb.
[00:56:04.180 --> 00:56:07.180]   Like, I probably, if somebody gave me, you know, half million dollars, I would have probably
[00:56:07.180 --> 00:56:09.180]   done some Facebook videos.
[00:56:09.180 --> 00:56:12.180]   But, you know, we still push out to Facebook.
[00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:15.180]   We didn't, you know, delete Facebook or anything.
[00:56:15.180 --> 00:56:16.180]   But, and we do have an audience there.
[00:56:16.180 --> 00:56:23.180]   I think we have like 300,000 people on 9 to 5 Mac and, you know, a few less on the other
[00:56:23.180 --> 00:56:24.180]   sites.
[00:56:24.180 --> 00:56:30.180]   So, we're, you know, we use Facebook, like everybody else, but we don't really promote
[00:56:30.180 --> 00:56:31.180]   it.
[00:56:31.180 --> 00:56:34.180]   We don't say, "Hey, you know, go to our Facebook page or anything like that."
[00:56:34.180 --> 00:56:38.180]   Yeah, we did the, Twit did the same thing on a much smaller scale than you guys.
[00:56:38.180 --> 00:56:40.180]   But Twit did the same thing with both YouTube and Facebook.
[00:56:40.180 --> 00:56:46.180]   I never really trusted either of those platforms to look out for my own best interest.
[00:56:46.180 --> 00:56:48.180]   Just as you said, Greg, they're not.
[00:56:48.180 --> 00:56:49.180]   Yeah.
[00:56:49.180 --> 00:56:50.180]   And not.
[00:56:50.180 --> 00:56:51.180]   They're not.
[00:56:51.180 --> 00:56:54.180]   Well, I know it's quite understood why people push their Facebook pages over their own websites.
[00:56:54.180 --> 00:56:57.180]   I mean, you know, you control Twit.com.
[00:56:57.180 --> 00:56:58.180]   I mean, that you own that.
[00:56:58.180 --> 00:56:59.180]   Right.
[00:56:59.180 --> 00:57:00.180]   And, and.
[00:57:00.180 --> 00:57:01.180]   Actually, I don't, but I control Twit.tv.
[00:57:01.180 --> 00:57:04.180]   I don't know who asked Twit.com.
[00:57:04.180 --> 00:57:05.180]   Sorry about that.
[00:57:05.180 --> 00:57:07.180]   But you know what I mean.
[00:57:07.180 --> 00:57:08.180]   Yeah.
[00:57:08.180 --> 00:57:11.180]   Why, why are you, I think a lot of them got onto Facebook because they got analytics that
[00:57:11.180 --> 00:57:12.180]   worked.
[00:57:12.180 --> 00:57:16.180]   And it was all because, you know, a bunch of smart developers at Facebook put some analytics.
[00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:19.740]   So when people went to the page, you could see people coming from the page and then come
[00:57:19.740 --> 00:57:22.180]   into your website and that made you feel like you're in control.
[00:57:22.180 --> 00:57:28.180]   It was a false dawn, of course, because nowadays these, these publishers are realizing they
[00:57:28.180 --> 00:57:31.820]   have to build their own technology and they're hiring the same developers.
[00:57:31.820 --> 00:57:32.820]   They're building their own code.
[00:57:32.820 --> 00:57:36.500]   They're building out there, ditching their old 40 year old content management systems
[00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:38.780]   and growing up and getting something a bit modern.
[00:57:38.780 --> 00:57:42.660]   And now the analytics engines that they have are of a quality that where they should have
[00:57:42.660 --> 00:57:44.060]   had 10 years ago.
[00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:46.180]   They have to be technology companies.
[00:57:46.180 --> 00:57:50.980]   And they've kind of been through this, you know, I will get Facebook to do it for us.
[00:57:50.980 --> 00:57:52.180]   We'll get Facebook to do our ads.
[00:57:52.180 --> 00:57:55.620]   We'll get Google to do our ads and then realizing that was the dumbest thing we ever did.
[00:57:55.620 --> 00:57:56.940]   We've got to take it all in house.
[00:57:56.940 --> 00:58:02.660]   I'm going to this is I'm going to be a post state here and say I'm not convinced that
[00:58:02.660 --> 00:58:06.180]   analytics are all that useful either.
[00:58:06.180 --> 00:58:08.780]   I think that that's become in a similar way.
[00:58:08.780 --> 00:58:15.140]   That's become a kind of a religious, you know, illusion of control believe.
[00:58:15.140 --> 00:58:16.940]   Yeah, it's an illusion.
[00:58:16.940 --> 00:58:17.940]   It's an illusion.
[00:58:17.940 --> 00:58:18.940]   I don't know.
[00:58:18.940 --> 00:58:20.220]   I mean, we look at we get analytics.
[00:58:20.220 --> 00:58:21.940]   We look at analytics.
[00:58:21.940 --> 00:58:28.540]   But I think from a point of view of advertisers, I understand, you know, advertisers know they're
[00:58:28.540 --> 00:58:31.020]   that at least half of their money is wasted.
[00:58:31.020 --> 00:58:33.260]   They just don't know which half.
[00:58:33.260 --> 00:58:34.260]   They just don't know which half.
[00:58:34.260 --> 00:58:37.100]   And the old saying that's the same is all right.
[00:58:37.100 --> 00:58:38.100]   And they're trying to figure it out.
[00:58:38.100 --> 00:58:39.100]   I don't blame them.
[00:58:39.100 --> 00:58:44.940]   They want their ads to be more efficient, but ultimately, I don't know if analytics
[00:58:44.940 --> 00:58:46.660]   are the holy grail either.
[00:58:46.660 --> 00:58:48.420]   It's it's an illusion of control.
[00:58:48.420 --> 00:58:50.820]   They sold the vision of I can track every click.
[00:58:50.820 --> 00:58:54.860]   I can contract every impression and that's going to be better than what you're doing
[00:58:54.860 --> 00:58:55.860]   now.
[00:58:55.860 --> 00:58:59.380]   And of course, what we're seeing, of course, is big consumer brands pull out and go back
[00:58:59.380 --> 00:59:00.540]   to television and radio.
[00:59:00.540 --> 00:59:01.540]   They're pulling out of YouTube.
[00:59:01.540 --> 00:59:02.540]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:59:02.540 --> 00:59:03.540]   Yeah.
[00:59:03.540 --> 00:59:04.540]   Mm.
[00:59:04.540 --> 00:59:06.780]   Because they're not getting the traction that they want.
[00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:07.780]   Yes, they can.
[00:59:07.780 --> 00:59:12.220]   The only time that targeted advertising works is when you're really trying to reach a really
[00:59:12.220 --> 00:59:15.820]   specific audience like the like the political one.
[00:59:15.820 --> 00:59:19.900]   So if you're trying to get somebody who lives in a suburb of, you know, like if you're trying
[00:59:19.900 --> 00:59:23.860]   to target people who live in Cheltenham in the UK where I live and you just want people
[00:59:23.860 --> 00:59:28.460]   who are in the upper echelon and you want to target them with your high-end clothing
[00:59:28.460 --> 00:59:32.820]   brand, well, you know, these types of analytics driven systems are perfect.
[00:59:32.820 --> 00:59:36.460]   But if you're proctor and gamble and you're trying to promote, you know, washing liquid
[00:59:36.460 --> 00:59:39.820]   or something like that, why, why are you on Facebook?
[00:59:39.820 --> 00:59:42.860]   I don't think that's actually useful overall.
[00:59:42.860 --> 00:59:46.780]   Well, I think that's example of the analytics persuaded them.
[00:59:46.780 --> 00:59:49.260]   But I think we're the analytics is a shibblest.
[00:59:49.260 --> 00:59:54.020]   People are people treat it as if it's, you know, the Holy Grail for advertising is turning
[00:59:54.020 --> 00:59:55.820]   out not to be, I don't think all that useful.
[00:59:55.820 --> 00:59:56.820]   I guess if you're a.
[00:59:56.820 --> 00:59:57.820]   It's really interesting.
[00:59:57.820 --> 01:00:02.940]   I had not heard this big brands are turning are going back to their brand advertising on
[01:00:02.940 --> 01:00:03.940]   mainstream.
[01:00:03.940 --> 01:00:06.620]   Yeah, they're definitely pulling out of their winding back presence like Cisco, for example,
[01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:08.780]   is backed off YouTube completely.
[01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:10.540]   They no longer doing any ads on YouTube.
[01:00:10.540 --> 01:00:11.540]   That I understand.
[01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:16.220]   I mean, YouTube is the biggest scam in history.
[01:00:16.220 --> 01:00:20.340]   If I watch another wicks ad, I swear I'm going to put something through my screen.
[01:00:20.340 --> 01:00:24.180]   I mean, but the challenge I think with the is the illusion of control.
[01:00:24.180 --> 01:00:27.700]   And remember, a lot of the times that you they put these ads on these platforms and there's
[01:00:27.700 --> 01:00:32.180]   some salary slave there with a high school education who's looking at an analytics platform,
[01:00:32.180 --> 01:00:36.060]   trying to justify their reason for running minimum wage in an office job that's pretty
[01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:37.060]   cool.
[01:00:37.060 --> 01:00:38.060]   You know, it's a good job.
[01:00:38.060 --> 01:00:39.060]   They don't have to do a whole lot of work.
[01:00:39.060 --> 01:00:41.620]   They just have to put some ads on a platform and pretend.
[01:00:41.620 --> 01:00:45.180]   And if you can click a button and show that you did 10% better than you did last month,
[01:00:45.180 --> 01:00:47.780]   well, hello, you know, job done.
[01:00:47.780 --> 01:00:48.780]   I'm a legend.
[01:00:48.780 --> 01:00:49.780]   Give me a pay rise.
[01:00:49.780 --> 01:00:55.220]   But it's interesting because, I mean, in a way, the reason we have GDPR is because of,
[01:00:55.220 --> 01:01:02.020]   you know, the European privacy regulations is because of ad tech and the concern of consumers
[01:01:02.020 --> 01:01:05.620]   that they're being tracked and surveilled by companies.
[01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:09.780]   And really the reason companies track and surveil them is for targeted advertising.
[01:01:09.780 --> 01:01:14.940]   And would it be ironic if advertising targeting didn't work?
[01:01:14.940 --> 01:01:21.540]   And so the whole thing brought the house down for no good reason that, you know, I don't
[01:01:21.540 --> 01:01:22.900]   know, Seth, do you have an email?
[01:01:22.900 --> 01:01:24.060]   You must have an opinion on this.
[01:01:24.060 --> 01:01:27.580]   God, you've been you've been doing this for a year.
[01:01:27.580 --> 01:01:28.580]   Yeah.
[01:01:28.580 --> 01:01:33.820]   So I think there is some value to targeted advertising specifically as you, you know,
[01:01:33.820 --> 01:01:34.820]   kind of pare down.
[01:01:34.820 --> 01:01:35.820]   You're right.
[01:01:35.820 --> 01:01:38.620]   The procter and gamble stuff that everybody needs maybe doesn't make sense for.
[01:01:38.620 --> 01:01:44.020]   But for instance, iPhone cases, like what's a good place to advertise iPhone cases, probably
[01:01:44.020 --> 01:01:48.540]   9 to 5 Mac, you know, or, you know, Apple sites.
[01:01:48.540 --> 01:01:52.140]   So you could do that without, we could do that without targeted advertising because you
[01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:54.380]   know, Mac user is going to get 9 to 5.
[01:01:54.380 --> 01:01:55.380]   Yeah.
[01:01:55.380 --> 01:01:57.820]   That's what we don't, we don't do any analytics on our audience.
[01:01:57.820 --> 01:01:58.820]   We don't have to.
[01:01:58.820 --> 01:02:00.420]   We just say, you want to reach tech enthusiasts?
[01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:02.540]   Not if I Mac, you want to reach Mac users?
[01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:03.540]   Where else are you going to go?
[01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:04.540]   I mean, that's perfect.
[01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:05.980]   So you want to reach old people evening news.
[01:02:05.980 --> 01:02:09.780]   But I bet you said your advertisers still come to you and say, well, I want to see some
[01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:10.780]   analytics.
[01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:12.340]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:02:12.340 --> 01:02:19.660]   I mean, it's crazy because they have these ROI budgets that they can't escape out of
[01:02:19.660 --> 01:02:21.180]   their brains.
[01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:25.820]   So they come in and they say, well, you know, we need to make, you know, and they track
[01:02:25.820 --> 01:02:31.860]   the people from like our site to their site to the cash register and do they make a purchase.
[01:02:31.860 --> 01:02:36.020]   And then they come back and they're like, well, we didn't really make, you know, exactly
[01:02:36.020 --> 01:02:38.940]   what we paid you or we, you know, whatever.
[01:02:38.940 --> 01:02:43.260]   And I'm just kind of like, well, you know, like, oh, we got a lot of eyes.
[01:02:43.260 --> 01:02:44.260]   Yeah, I don't know.
[01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:45.260]   That makes any sense.
[01:02:45.260 --> 01:02:46.260]   Did you sell some cases?
[01:02:46.260 --> 01:02:47.260]   Tell me.
[01:02:47.260 --> 01:02:51.500]   Just sell, you know, we, and all of our ads are direct response ads, which is why you
[01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:56.700]   hear in an ad you'll have a custom URL or a promo code and all of that.
[01:02:56.700 --> 01:03:04.060]   And, and I shouldn't say this out loud, but so advertisers, sometimes we'll get advertisers
[01:03:04.060 --> 01:03:12.500]   say, well, this show doesn't work.
[01:03:12.500 --> 01:03:16.700]   And we say, what do you, all the promo codes I'm getting are Twitch.
[01:03:16.700 --> 01:03:17.700]   Yeah.
[01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:19.740]   But you didn't even buy ads on Twitch.
[01:03:19.740 --> 01:03:21.220]   You bought ads on that other show.
[01:03:21.220 --> 01:03:25.580]   So honestly, if you're getting ads, promo codes from Twitch, that's us.
[01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:26.580]   That's that show.
[01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:29.580]   And they, and they don't know, but it doesn't match.
[01:03:29.580 --> 01:03:31.580]   It's, yeah, there's a lot of that.
[01:03:31.580 --> 01:03:32.580]   There's way more of that.
[01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:37.380]   But the advertiser, though it's, of course, and I'm, look, I'm a business person, you're
[01:03:37.380 --> 01:03:39.060]   going to spend money on advertising.
[01:03:39.060 --> 01:03:40.420]   You have to do that.
[01:03:40.420 --> 01:03:43.140]   You hope that that will make you more money than you spent.
[01:03:43.140 --> 01:03:45.180]   That's the real ROI.
[01:03:45.180 --> 01:03:49.940]   And if, if you sold more iPhone cases, then it cost you to buy the ads on nine to five
[01:03:49.940 --> 01:03:54.340]   Mac, I think that's a success, regardless of what the analytics tell you, but they want
[01:03:54.340 --> 01:03:55.340]   more.
[01:03:55.340 --> 01:03:56.340]   Absolutely.
[01:03:56.340 --> 01:03:57.340]   Yes, right.
[01:03:57.340 --> 01:04:03.100]   They just want, like, they want their computer spreadsheet to, like, look, you know, and,
[01:04:03.100 --> 01:04:07.620]   you know, like, you know, we did an ad or something and maybe some people didn't enter
[01:04:07.620 --> 01:04:12.180]   the promo code or some people, like, came back a day later or a week later and made
[01:04:12.180 --> 01:04:16.380]   a purchase or it's left it in a cart or a million other different scenarios.
[01:04:16.380 --> 01:04:20.100]   And if it doesn't match 100%, then they're like, well, I don't know if we can do this
[01:04:20.100 --> 01:04:21.100]   again or something.
[01:04:21.100 --> 01:04:22.100]   Yeah.
[01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:25.340]   And I'm always like, it's not just, it's not just this tracking stuff.
[01:04:25.340 --> 01:04:26.340]   There's like more to it.
[01:04:26.340 --> 01:04:29.020]   Like it's about the brand, it's about the awareness and.
[01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:34.300]   It's six months until they buy something, you know, we've had that problem where two
[01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:39.100]   years later, after a podcast went through, customer rocks up in front of a, now we work
[01:04:39.100 --> 01:04:42.220]   in enterprise IT at packet pushes, so a bit different game.
[01:04:42.220 --> 01:04:45.060]   But we've had people turn up to the vendor two years later and say, I heard your show
[01:04:45.060 --> 01:04:46.060]   two years ago.
[01:04:46.060 --> 01:04:47.060]   Yeah.
[01:04:47.060 --> 01:04:48.060]   I've been putting a project together.
[01:04:48.060 --> 01:04:49.060]   Yeah.
[01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:50.060]   Now we're ready to go.
[01:04:50.060 --> 01:04:51.060]   Yeah.
[01:04:51.060 --> 01:04:52.060]   You'll get any good for that.
[01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:53.060]   Yeah.
[01:04:53.060 --> 01:04:55.060]   My favorite one, Seth and you'll have done this is next time somebody says to you, I didn't
[01:04:55.060 --> 01:04:56.060]   get any ROI.
[01:04:56.060 --> 01:04:58.660]   My favorite one is to say, well, maybe your products junk.
[01:04:58.660 --> 01:04:59.660]   Yes.
[01:04:59.660 --> 01:05:00.660]   Nobody.
[01:05:00.660 --> 01:05:01.660]   I can't help you there.
[01:05:01.660 --> 01:05:02.660]   Like I can't help you.
[01:05:02.660 --> 01:05:03.660]   Your products, not with buying.
[01:05:03.660 --> 01:05:04.660]   I can't help you.
[01:05:04.660 --> 01:05:06.380]   All we can do, we can lead a horse to water.
[01:05:06.380 --> 01:05:11.100]   We can't make them buy those Instagram shorts that I bought last night.
[01:05:11.100 --> 01:05:12.100]   Yeah.
[01:05:12.100 --> 01:05:13.100]   That's right.
[01:05:13.100 --> 01:05:15.140]   But maybe you don't say that out loud, but you can think it in your inside voice or something.
[01:05:15.140 --> 01:05:17.700]   No, all of our products that we sell are perfect.
[01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:18.700]   Yes.
[01:05:18.700 --> 01:05:21.180]   Actually, we turn down products that I don't support.
[01:05:21.180 --> 01:05:22.180]   So that is one thing.
[01:05:22.180 --> 01:05:23.180]   Yeah.
[01:05:23.180 --> 01:05:24.180]   I'm in the same boat.
[01:05:24.180 --> 01:05:26.420]   I'm not an ad, so it's an easy thing to do.
[01:05:26.420 --> 01:05:27.420]   I don't, but yeah.
[01:05:27.420 --> 01:05:28.420]   Yeah.
[01:05:28.420 --> 01:05:29.420]   Yeah.
[01:05:29.420 --> 01:05:31.460]   I don't want to do ads for stuff for belly fat on nine to five Mac.
[01:05:31.460 --> 01:05:32.460]   Yeah.
[01:05:32.460 --> 01:05:33.820]   Or even I have no idea what's off.
[01:05:33.820 --> 01:05:35.420]   I have no idea where it's going to wrap around.
[01:05:35.420 --> 01:05:36.420]   It doesn't.
[01:05:36.420 --> 01:05:37.420]   It always makes sense.
[01:05:37.420 --> 01:05:38.420]   Right.
[01:05:38.420 --> 01:05:39.420]   Right.
[01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:44.300]   No, I think that that's unfortunate because what's happened really is that because of
[01:05:44.300 --> 01:05:51.900]   the fetishization of numbers that really most digital advertising now goes through Google
[01:05:51.900 --> 01:05:52.900]   and Facebook.
[01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:57.700]   They have something like 80% of the market because they can produce that kind of, you
[01:05:57.700 --> 01:06:00.380]   know, they can really fill your spreadsheet with stuff.
[01:06:00.380 --> 01:06:01.380]   Yeah.
[01:06:01.380 --> 01:06:02.380]   Yep.
[01:06:02.380 --> 01:06:05.820]   Doesn't mean they're better, but just they can fill your spreadsheet with stuff.
[01:06:05.820 --> 01:06:09.260]   We have customers coming and working with packet pushes network.
[01:06:09.260 --> 01:06:12.260]   And the reason that they deal with us is because we don't do analytics driven marketing.
[01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:13.260]   Good for you.
[01:06:13.260 --> 01:06:14.260]   So we won't target.
[01:06:14.260 --> 01:06:15.260]   We don't do it.
[01:06:15.260 --> 01:06:16.260]   But we can do that too.
[01:06:16.260 --> 01:06:17.260]   You and I can do that because we're small.
[01:06:17.260 --> 01:06:18.260]   Yep.
[01:06:18.260 --> 01:06:19.940]   We're very specific niche.
[01:06:19.940 --> 01:06:20.940]   Yep.
[01:06:20.940 --> 01:06:27.820]   Meanwhile, teens, according to TechCrunch, are dumping Facebook for YouTube, Instagram,
[01:06:27.820 --> 01:06:28.820]   and Snapchat.
[01:06:28.820 --> 01:06:30.580]   Actually, it's according to Pew.
[01:06:30.580 --> 01:06:32.340]   Pew does these great surveys.
[01:06:32.340 --> 01:06:33.740]   The Pew, what is it?
[01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:34.740]   American life.
[01:06:34.740 --> 01:06:36.300]   Pew, Pew, Internet research.
[01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:37.300]   Yeah.
[01:06:37.300 --> 01:06:38.620]   They're a great, Pew research center.
[01:06:38.620 --> 01:06:39.620]   Good to group.
[01:06:39.620 --> 01:06:40.620]   Great stuff.
[01:06:40.620 --> 01:06:41.620]   Yeah.
[01:06:41.620 --> 01:06:47.140]   So that's also the lead story on Larrytheworld.com, which is Facebook slips, Snapchat grows among
[01:06:47.140 --> 01:06:48.420]   teens.
[01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:50.900]   But the real big issue on that story, the real shocker.
[01:06:50.900 --> 01:06:57.300]   In some ways, is that 45% of the kids are online almost constantly when you ask them how long
[01:06:57.300 --> 01:06:59.100]   they're online, which is what?
[01:06:59.100 --> 01:07:02.720]   And then if you add, you add the ones that are online several times a day, I think it
[01:07:02.720 --> 01:07:07.180]   comes to 89% of teens are online either constantly or several times a day.
[01:07:07.180 --> 01:07:09.220]   So that's a huge number.
[01:07:09.220 --> 01:07:16.820]   And that, and also in the environment where they have mixed feelings about how, you know,
[01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:18.220]   they feel about social media.
[01:07:18.220 --> 01:07:19.220]   Right.
[01:07:19.220 --> 01:07:21.820]   So more percents say it's mostly negative.
[01:07:21.820 --> 01:07:25.820]   Only 31% say it's mostly positive.
[01:07:25.820 --> 01:07:33.460]   But nevertheless 45% of teens spend our, I don't know what almost constantly or virtually
[01:07:33.460 --> 01:07:34.460]   constantly.
[01:07:34.460 --> 01:07:38.460]   I actually, I have a podcast with the author of that, which again, you'll find on Larrytheworld.
[01:07:38.460 --> 01:07:42.660]   And I couldn't get her to actually define what almost constantly means other than they
[01:07:42.660 --> 01:07:43.940]   keep looking at their phone.
[01:07:43.940 --> 01:07:44.940]   Yeah.
[01:07:44.940 --> 01:07:45.940]   They're with the podcast right on top.
[01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:46.940]   Yeah.
[01:07:46.940 --> 01:07:47.940]   But who's not almost constantly on their phone?
[01:07:47.940 --> 01:07:51.580]   Well, you're always looking at constantly online.
[01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:52.820]   Your phone's always online.
[01:07:52.820 --> 01:07:54.580]   It's always in your pocket.
[01:07:54.580 --> 01:07:55.580]   And it's frequent.
[01:07:55.580 --> 01:07:57.660]   It's freakingly addictive.
[01:07:57.660 --> 01:08:03.780]   And yeah, I mean, if I'm not on a computer, I'm on my phone.
[01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:08.140]   Even if I have three seconds of dead time waiting in the grocery line at the store, my
[01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:10.220]   phone, that's out.
[01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:11.220]   Yep.
[01:08:11.220 --> 01:08:12.220]   It's depressing.
[01:08:12.220 --> 01:08:15.580]   I've been trying to ask directions on the street, you know, when you want, you want
[01:08:15.580 --> 01:08:16.580]   directions.
[01:08:16.580 --> 01:08:18.380]   You've got a smartphone.
[01:08:18.380 --> 01:08:22.380]   Well, but Google Maps is great when you're driving and not so great when you're walking.
[01:08:22.380 --> 01:08:25.820]   Because you're not walking fast enough for it to update in real time.
[01:08:25.820 --> 01:08:28.740]   That's why this is a lot of reality in Google Maps.
[01:08:28.740 --> 01:08:30.500]   Well, they're doing that.
[01:08:30.500 --> 01:08:32.340]   That's actually one of the things they want to do.
[01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:33.340]   That's why they're doing it.
[01:08:33.340 --> 01:08:34.340]   Yeah.
[01:08:34.340 --> 01:08:35.340]   Yeah.
[01:08:35.340 --> 01:08:37.060]   Well, in the meantime, I occasionally want to ask directions, but everybody's on their
[01:08:37.060 --> 01:08:39.220]   phone and you're in excess.
[01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:42.900]   Hey, hey, buddy, buddy, buddy.
[01:08:42.900 --> 01:08:44.140]   Exactly.
[01:08:44.140 --> 01:08:45.140]   Wow.
[01:08:45.140 --> 01:08:46.140]   Wow.
[01:08:46.140 --> 01:08:47.140]   Wow.
[01:08:47.140 --> 01:08:48.140]   Wow.
[01:08:48.140 --> 01:08:49.140]   Wow.
[01:08:49.140 --> 01:08:50.140]   What a world we live in.
[01:08:50.140 --> 01:08:52.740]   It's what can you say?
[01:08:52.740 --> 01:08:57.100]   But I mean, how many times you go to a restaurant and see a family sitting at a table and none
[01:08:57.100 --> 01:08:58.660]   of them are looking or talking to each other.
[01:08:58.660 --> 01:09:01.500]   They're all even mom and dad on their phone.
[01:09:01.500 --> 01:09:04.700]   Yeah, it's really depressing when that's our family.
[01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:05.700]   Yeah.
[01:09:05.700 --> 01:09:10.020]   But I have to tell you, I'm a, I'm a, the canary in the coal mine.
[01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:13.420]   I'm an early adopter because I remember my kids berating me because I wouldn't put my
[01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:15.220]   blackberry down.
[01:09:15.220 --> 01:09:16.740]   Mm hmm.
[01:09:16.740 --> 01:09:21.980]   When my son was in college, he made us go on vacation to a quote resort in Mexico that
[01:09:21.980 --> 01:09:23.140]   had no cell phone service.
[01:09:23.140 --> 01:09:27.340]   He actually researched it and found one that was in a dead zone and they didn't have an
[01:09:27.340 --> 01:09:28.340]   internet cap.
[01:09:28.340 --> 01:09:29.340]   Yeah, I think that's the thing.
[01:09:29.340 --> 01:09:31.940]   I think kids understand how deleterious this is.
[01:09:31.940 --> 01:09:32.940]   Exactly.
[01:09:32.940 --> 01:09:35.420]   He made me go through a week of detoxification.
[01:09:35.420 --> 01:09:37.100]   I would not accept that.
[01:09:37.100 --> 01:09:38.100]   No.
[01:09:38.100 --> 01:09:39.100]   You can't do it.
[01:09:39.100 --> 01:09:41.100]   I love my phone, but I love my kids even more.
[01:09:41.100 --> 01:09:42.100]   Oh, you must.
[01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:43.100]   Yeah.
[01:09:43.100 --> 01:09:45.100]   I love YouTube even more.
[01:09:45.100 --> 01:09:46.100]   Yeah.
[01:09:46.100 --> 01:09:50.940]   YouTube, Instagram and Snapchat number one, YouTube, 85% of teens say they use YouTube.
[01:09:50.940 --> 01:09:51.940]   Mm hmm.
[01:09:51.940 --> 01:09:54.300]   72% use Instagram.
[01:09:54.300 --> 01:09:55.300]   That's really it.
[01:09:55.300 --> 01:09:56.700]   That's a big jump, isn't it?
[01:09:56.700 --> 01:09:58.900]   Because Snapchat used to be dominant.
[01:09:58.900 --> 01:09:59.900]   Instagram is just a gene.
[01:09:59.900 --> 01:10:03.500]   Look at the right column, the one that they use the most and that's where Snapchat is still
[01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:04.500]   dominant.
[01:10:04.500 --> 01:10:05.500]   Still.
[01:10:05.500 --> 01:10:06.500]   35%.
[01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:07.500]   Yeah.
[01:10:07.500 --> 01:10:08.500]   A lot of time spent on Snapchat.
[01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:09.500]   And look how low Instagram is on that one.
[01:10:09.500 --> 01:10:10.500]   2015% which is very interesting.
[01:10:10.500 --> 01:10:11.500]   Yeah.
[01:10:11.500 --> 01:10:15.380]   Instagram lends itself to posting and moving on.
[01:10:15.380 --> 01:10:18.780]   Snapchat is an interaction that you continue.
[01:10:18.780 --> 01:10:24.540]   But only 10% use Facebook most often and it's only about half of the total usage.
[01:10:24.540 --> 01:10:26.780]   Instagram is more like a blog for teenagers.
[01:10:26.780 --> 01:10:28.820]   For my daughter, Instagram is like a blog.
[01:10:28.820 --> 01:10:30.260]   I was here, I did this.
[01:10:30.260 --> 01:10:31.260]   I post a picture of me.
[01:10:31.260 --> 01:10:32.820]   Snapchat is an interactive thing.
[01:10:32.820 --> 01:10:33.820]   I mean, they're always.
[01:10:33.820 --> 01:10:37.140]   Snapchat is your messaging platform for you and your friends.
[01:10:37.140 --> 01:10:39.540]   Facebook is what you use to communicate with your grandparents.
[01:10:39.540 --> 01:10:41.540]   And that's why they need to know.
[01:10:41.540 --> 01:10:46.100]   I mean, I haven't met anybody in my daughters.
[01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:52.900]   I've got two daughters at 20 and 17 and none of them in that group use Facebook for anything
[01:10:52.900 --> 01:10:55.220]   other than a sort of a public face.
[01:10:55.220 --> 01:10:56.220]   They use it occasionally.
[01:10:56.220 --> 01:10:57.220]   I have a theory.
[01:10:57.220 --> 01:11:03.060]   You tell me though, that's because they don't, they haven't yet faced the problem that the
[01:11:03.060 --> 01:11:05.660]   rest of us face, which is they've moved on.
[01:11:05.660 --> 01:11:07.340]   Their friends are right there.
[01:11:07.340 --> 01:11:10.980]   They're too young to have friend groups in multiple places.
[01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:14.820]   But as they get older and they have friends who are in high school, friends who are in
[01:11:14.820 --> 01:11:18.780]   college, friends who are at that job, but they no longer work with, that's when Facebook
[01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:20.580]   will become valuable to them.
[01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:23.820]   And I, if I were Facebook, I wouldn't necessarily be worried about this.
[01:11:23.820 --> 01:11:29.740]   I, for instance, my 26 year old who's been to two colleges has lived in many countries.
[01:11:29.740 --> 01:11:30.740]   She does use Facebook.
[01:11:30.740 --> 01:11:32.980]   It's the only way she can deep track it with a big.
[01:11:32.980 --> 01:11:35.140]   She couldn't do that in Instagram or on Snapchat.
[01:11:35.140 --> 01:11:38.820]   She uses Instagram too, but the way you stay in touch and keep up with all this stuff,
[01:11:38.820 --> 01:11:43.780]   I left Facebook and you know why I ended up going back because they had a tech TV reunion
[01:11:43.780 --> 01:11:47.740]   I didn't know about because the only way you could know about it was on Facebook.
[01:11:47.740 --> 01:11:50.540]   It's for, it's for diaspora communities.
[01:11:50.540 --> 01:11:54.420]   And I think that that's why kids don't need it yet.
[01:11:54.420 --> 01:11:56.420]   But that doesn't mean they're not going to turn to it.
[01:11:56.420 --> 01:11:58.380]   No, no, I'll challenge you there.
[01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:01.620]   My teenagers are getting really good at burning relationships.
[01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:02.620]   So burning bridges.
[01:12:02.620 --> 01:12:06.020]   That's why I don't need Facebook.
[01:12:06.020 --> 01:12:08.060]   I don't want to keep track of people.
[01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:09.060]   Exactly.
[01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:10.540]   So my Facebook is deleted.
[01:12:10.540 --> 01:12:15.980]   I think it's about a 10 days away from deactivation and good bloody riddance to it as well.
[01:12:15.980 --> 01:12:21.540]   I did not miss it when I was gone and I don't miss, I don't use it hardly any way yet now,
[01:12:21.540 --> 01:12:24.780]   but it was the only way I could keep up with this group.
[01:12:24.780 --> 01:12:29.220]   Every now and then I need to log in for something and the only way I can do it is Facebook.
[01:12:29.220 --> 01:12:32.140]   But all I'll ever do is probably register and then delete it again.
[01:12:32.140 --> 01:12:37.380]   My daughters do use tools to stay in contact with people.
[01:12:37.380 --> 01:12:41.820]   But because they're always on, they're always constantly talking, they're always, you can't
[01:12:41.820 --> 01:12:43.900]   carry all of those people along behind you.
[01:12:43.900 --> 01:12:46.460]   They just become a dead weight on you emotionally.
[01:12:46.460 --> 01:12:47.460]   I agree.
[01:12:47.460 --> 01:12:52.620]   We just, like I know nobody from my school and I don't want to have anything to do with
[01:12:52.620 --> 01:12:53.620]   those morons.
[01:12:53.620 --> 01:12:54.620]   You know?
[01:12:54.620 --> 01:12:55.620]   Okay.
[01:12:55.620 --> 01:12:56.620]   Okay.
[01:12:56.620 --> 01:12:58.420]   But you're a people like other people.
[01:12:58.420 --> 01:13:00.620]   You're a, you're a, you hate people.
[01:13:00.620 --> 01:13:01.620]   You're a misanthropist.
[01:13:01.620 --> 01:13:02.620]   Okay.
[01:13:02.620 --> 01:13:03.620]   I got it.
[01:13:03.620 --> 01:13:04.620]   But I mean, move on.
[01:13:04.620 --> 01:13:08.140]   Like doesn't life just keep moving on and you make new friends and you go through a
[01:13:08.140 --> 01:13:09.140]   new phase?
[01:13:09.140 --> 01:13:12.220]   Why are you dragging your whole life behind you like some moment?
[01:13:12.220 --> 01:13:13.220]   Okay.
[01:13:13.220 --> 01:13:14.220]   Larry, you're an old guy.
[01:13:14.220 --> 01:13:17.980]   Don't you cherish those relationships you've had over these, in these golden years?
[01:13:17.980 --> 01:13:20.340]   Well, the funny things are the only friends I have are old friends.
[01:13:20.340 --> 01:13:21.340]   Nobody likes me anymore.
[01:13:21.340 --> 01:13:22.900]   It's the old people still.
[01:13:22.900 --> 01:13:25.500]   But you know, my kids are in their thirties and they are still in touch with their high
[01:13:25.500 --> 01:13:26.500]   school friends.
[01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:29.340]   And I don't mean just like I am like, five years.
[01:13:29.340 --> 01:13:34.220]   They know exactly, they go to parties and you know, and when they travel, they visit
[01:13:34.220 --> 01:13:35.220]   them.
[01:13:35.220 --> 01:13:36.220]   I think it's creepy.
[01:13:36.220 --> 01:13:37.620]   But yeah, I don't think it's creepy.
[01:13:37.620 --> 01:13:38.620]   I think it's great.
[01:13:38.620 --> 01:13:42.020]   You know, if they like their friends, there are, there are two kinds of people in the
[01:13:42.020 --> 01:13:43.020]   world.
[01:13:43.020 --> 01:13:45.580]   There are people who like people and people don't like people.
[01:13:45.580 --> 01:13:49.700]   They're people who like really cultivate and keep friendships and they make a point of
[01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:51.220]   staying in touch and stuff.
[01:13:51.220 --> 01:13:52.220]   And I'm more like Greg.
[01:13:52.220 --> 01:13:53.620]   I don't want to.
[01:13:53.620 --> 01:13:57.180]   I actually am still friends with people like, you know, new in college and my first couple
[01:13:57.180 --> 01:13:58.180]   of jobs.
[01:13:58.180 --> 01:13:59.180]   But I don't talk to you.
[01:13:59.180 --> 01:14:01.180]   Okay, Seth, where do you come on this scale?
[01:14:01.180 --> 01:14:02.180]   Okay.
[01:14:02.180 --> 01:14:03.980]   So there's two things I use Facebook for.
[01:14:03.980 --> 01:14:06.980]   One is my mom thinks Facebook is the internet.
[01:14:06.980 --> 01:14:11.980]   She like, she's like in one of those countries that Facebook is the internet.
[01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:15.500]   So if she wants to see pictures of our kids.
[01:14:15.500 --> 01:14:16.500]   Is that Indiana?
[01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:18.060]   What country is that?
[01:14:18.060 --> 01:14:19.620]   Yeah, Northeast Ohio.
[01:14:19.620 --> 01:14:23.460]   But yeah, so it's just to go for the border actually.
[01:14:23.460 --> 01:14:24.820]   I was pretty close.
[01:14:24.820 --> 01:14:26.220]   Yeah, actually.
[01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:27.300]   Impressive.
[01:14:27.300 --> 01:14:32.740]   So we put pictures on there for them that we absolutely in, you know, sometimes it's through
[01:14:32.740 --> 01:14:34.580]   Instagram or whatever.
[01:14:34.580 --> 01:14:39.900]   And then the other thing is like, I do look at stats like, you know, whatever, but I look
[01:14:39.900 --> 01:14:44.260]   at stats on Facebook through 95 back and all the other stuff.
[01:14:44.260 --> 01:14:48.020]   So as a publisher, I need to look at that stuff at least know what's going on.
[01:14:48.020 --> 01:14:49.020]   Oh, yeah.
[01:14:49.020 --> 01:14:50.020]   So I use Facebook.
[01:14:50.020 --> 01:14:51.020]   Yes.
[01:14:51.020 --> 01:14:54.100]   There are some people and I'm one of them that we there's a professional reason we have
[01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:55.100]   to keep up with Facebook.
[01:14:55.100 --> 01:14:57.580]   I have to know what Facebook going on on Facebook so I can.
[01:14:57.580 --> 01:14:58.580]   Right.
[01:14:58.580 --> 01:14:59.580]   I just show it.
[01:14:59.580 --> 01:15:00.580]   Right.
[01:15:00.580 --> 01:15:01.580]   Yeah.
[01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:03.700]   I mean, deleting Facebook for me isn't sadly even an option.
[01:15:03.700 --> 01:15:08.620]   Like I wouldn't even consider it because of the business and my mom.
[01:15:08.620 --> 01:15:11.820]   Oh, you're a good sunset.
[01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:13.340]   You're a good son.
[01:15:13.340 --> 01:15:14.340]   I showed it.
[01:15:14.340 --> 01:15:15.340]   You have boy.
[01:15:15.340 --> 01:15:16.340]   Yeah.
[01:15:16.340 --> 01:15:17.340]   I showed it.
[01:15:17.340 --> 01:15:21.380]   They've brought to you by rockets mortgage.
[01:15:21.380 --> 01:15:22.580]   Talk about the old days.
[01:15:22.580 --> 01:15:30.380]   We're like, well, I remember when we bought our house four years ago back back in the 2014s,
[01:15:30.380 --> 01:15:34.900]   13s, you if you wanted a home loan, you went to a bank because that's where the money
[01:15:34.900 --> 01:15:39.820]   is right in the, the banker would have a sheaf of paper with all the rates on it.
[01:15:39.820 --> 01:15:43.940]   He, our banker had a fancy mortgage amortization calculator.
[01:15:43.940 --> 01:15:45.340]   He was so proud of that.
[01:15:45.340 --> 01:15:46.340]   He put in numbers.
[01:15:46.340 --> 01:15:47.340]   Well, that's your payment right there.
[01:15:47.340 --> 01:15:48.500]   You do it again.
[01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:49.500]   He just kept.
[01:15:49.500 --> 01:15:50.980]   He was so proud of that.
[01:15:50.980 --> 01:15:56.180]   And then, you know, you go through that in dignity, then he gives you an application, you
[01:15:56.180 --> 01:15:58.620]   know, 20 page, you got to take that home.
[01:15:58.620 --> 01:16:02.780]   You got to go to the attic and find your pay stubs from three years ago, bank statements
[01:16:02.780 --> 01:16:07.740]   from last century and get all that together.
[01:16:07.740 --> 01:16:11.820]   And then send that packet in the irony of it was, and we went to the big bank that bank
[01:16:11.820 --> 01:16:16.140]   everybody knows with this, which whips in the stage coach and all that.
[01:16:16.140 --> 01:16:19.460]   And they came back again and said, well, we need now, we need, we need to go back to
[01:16:19.460 --> 01:16:20.460]   the attic.
[01:16:20.460 --> 01:16:22.100]   And this and this and this.
[01:16:22.100 --> 01:16:23.940]   And it took two months, two months.
[01:16:23.940 --> 01:16:29.940]   We were, they were asking us to fax stuff to them from our vacation.
[01:16:29.940 --> 01:16:32.860]   Finally got the loan, but man, we almost lost the house.
[01:16:32.860 --> 01:16:35.180]   That is the way it used to be.
[01:16:35.180 --> 01:16:41.900]   Fast forward to 2018, baby, the modern times, quick and loans, the number one lender in
[01:16:41.900 --> 01:16:45.860]   the country said, this is not, this will not stand.
[01:16:45.860 --> 01:16:50.820]   We are going to make a way, you can, you can get a loan entirely online.
[01:16:50.820 --> 01:16:53.300]   You can do it in a matter of minutes.
[01:16:53.300 --> 01:16:55.340]   You can do it from your phone.
[01:16:55.340 --> 01:16:57.940]   You could do it in an open house.
[01:16:57.940 --> 01:16:59.140]   It's called rocket mortgage.
[01:16:59.140 --> 01:17:01.940]   It's aptly named because it is fast.
[01:17:01.940 --> 01:17:03.540]   Rocket mortgage is simple.
[01:17:03.540 --> 01:17:06.540]   It allows you to fully understand all the details, everything that's going on.
[01:17:06.540 --> 01:17:09.580]   They tell you you can be confident you're getting that right loan.
[01:17:09.580 --> 01:17:10.860]   It's very easy.
[01:17:10.860 --> 01:17:13.540]   You don't have to go to the attic to get paperwork.
[01:17:13.540 --> 01:17:18.700]   Your trusted partners allow you to share your financial information at the touch of a button.
[01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:20.900]   It's very powerful.
[01:17:20.900 --> 01:17:26.780]   Rocket mortgage can perform, get this, thousands of calculations in seconds.
[01:17:26.780 --> 01:17:33.020]   At best, that guy at the bank, he could do one amortization in about 45 seconds.
[01:17:33.020 --> 01:17:34.260]   At best.
[01:17:34.260 --> 01:17:37.860]   Based on income assets, credit, rocket mortgage calculates the numbers.
[01:17:37.860 --> 01:17:40.380]   This is usually less than 10 minutes.
[01:17:40.380 --> 01:17:42.980]   You can analyze all the home loan options for which you qualify.
[01:17:42.980 --> 01:17:44.260]   Find the one that's right for you.
[01:17:44.260 --> 01:17:47.420]   You specify the term, the down payment, the rate.
[01:17:47.420 --> 01:17:49.380]   They say you're approved.
[01:17:49.380 --> 01:17:50.580]   You show it to the realtor.
[01:17:50.580 --> 01:17:51.580]   You make an offer.
[01:17:51.580 --> 01:17:52.780]   It's that fast.
[01:17:52.780 --> 01:17:54.740]   Rocket mortgage by quick and loans.
[01:17:54.740 --> 01:17:57.140]   Really, this is the modern way to apply.
[01:17:57.140 --> 01:17:59.660]   Or by the way, refi.
[01:17:59.660 --> 01:18:04.820]   Apply simply, understand fully mortgage confidently at rocketmortgage.com/twit2.
[01:18:04.820 --> 01:18:07.540]   That's rocketmortgage.com/twit.
[01:18:07.540 --> 01:18:09.700]   And the number two, get that right.
[01:18:09.700 --> 01:18:13.860]   They are paying attention, rocketmortgage.com/twit2.
[01:18:13.860 --> 01:18:15.620]   It would help us if you would do that.
[01:18:15.620 --> 01:18:20.420]   Equal housing, later licenses, all 50 states and MLS consumer access.org number 30-30.
[01:18:20.420 --> 01:18:24.580]   We thank Rocket mortgage for making this week in tech possible.
[01:18:24.580 --> 01:18:25.980]   We had a very good week this week.
[01:18:25.980 --> 01:18:27.380]   In fact, it was such a good week.
[01:18:27.380 --> 01:18:32.700]   We prepared a short informative documentary for you to watch.
[01:18:32.700 --> 01:18:33.700]   Enjoy.
[01:18:33.700 --> 01:18:35.500]   Previously, on to it.
[01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:38.900]   After going to Japan, this is another thing I'm just going to strongly suggest on the
[01:18:38.900 --> 01:18:39.900]   handkerchief.
[01:18:39.900 --> 01:18:42.020]   iOS today.
[01:18:42.020 --> 01:18:44.420]   One is for crying ladies.
[01:18:44.420 --> 01:18:45.420]   Okay.
[01:18:45.420 --> 01:18:46.660]   We might need that.
[01:18:46.660 --> 01:18:48.420]   Then you keep the other one in your pocket.
[01:18:48.420 --> 01:18:50.940]   But that way, they came from the same pocket.
[01:18:50.940 --> 01:18:52.340]   Okay, you see?
[01:18:52.340 --> 01:18:55.340]   Why you don't want it with crying ladies, you gotta be careful.
[01:18:55.340 --> 01:18:56.340]   So...
[01:18:56.340 --> 01:18:57.980]   It's just like you're the one that made them cry.
[01:18:57.980 --> 01:18:58.980]   Well, that's...
[01:18:58.980 --> 01:19:01.820]   I guess maybe why I know a lot about crying ladies.
[01:19:01.820 --> 01:19:02.980]   This week in computer hardware.
[01:19:02.980 --> 01:19:05.300]   Did you see the Atari VCS?
[01:19:05.300 --> 01:19:06.300]   I did.
[01:19:06.300 --> 01:19:08.020]   What up, I need to go yesterday?
[01:19:08.020 --> 01:19:12.140]   I am ashamed to say that I actually really want one of these.
[01:19:12.140 --> 01:19:15.300]   Why are you ashamed outside of the fact that it's an Atari?
[01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:16.300]   It's an Atari.
[01:19:16.300 --> 01:19:19.140]   I mean, it's absolutely an nostalgia player.
[01:19:19.140 --> 01:19:20.140]   Tech news weekly.
[01:19:20.140 --> 01:19:24.580]   I thought we'd end this show by taking a look at what I got from Amazon.
[01:19:24.580 --> 01:19:27.980]   For the audio listeners, I will just say this is a pretty large box, right?
[01:19:27.980 --> 01:19:28.980]   Yeah.
[01:19:28.980 --> 01:19:29.980]   Okay.
[01:19:29.980 --> 01:19:30.980]   There.
[01:19:30.980 --> 01:19:33.060]   And at the bottom of the box...
[01:19:33.060 --> 01:19:37.100]   It's a package of Oreo cookies.
[01:19:37.100 --> 01:19:39.660]   That is really the worst thing to happen to anyone.
[01:19:39.660 --> 01:19:40.660]   Twit.
[01:19:40.660 --> 01:19:42.660]   Hashtag, patch, jack.
[01:19:42.660 --> 01:19:46.500]   No, I think maybe this flavor might be the worst thing to happen to anyone.
[01:19:46.500 --> 01:19:47.500]   I'm gonna try it.
[01:19:47.500 --> 01:19:49.020]   Obviously we have to wait until Tuesday.
[01:19:49.020 --> 01:19:50.780]   Unless Burk has his hand that he...
[01:19:50.780 --> 01:19:52.780]   His mechanical hand that's healed the voice.
[01:19:52.780 --> 01:19:53.780]   His little hand.
[01:19:53.780 --> 01:19:56.420]   If you want to tweet at me, I'm at Megan Marone.
[01:19:56.420 --> 01:19:57.420]   I'm at Jason.
[01:19:57.420 --> 01:19:58.420]   Hell, I'm not doing that.
[01:19:58.420 --> 01:19:59.420]   Megan's doing that to herself.
[01:19:59.420 --> 01:20:00.420]   I've never seen that in the Russian.
[01:20:00.420 --> 01:20:01.420]   I'm not doing that.
[01:20:01.420 --> 01:20:02.420]   I've never seen that in the Russian.
[01:20:02.420 --> 01:20:09.060]   I won't want to them.
[01:20:09.060 --> 01:20:10.060]   That is awesome.
[01:20:10.060 --> 01:20:11.460]   I didn't know.
[01:20:11.460 --> 01:20:12.740]   We even had those.
[01:20:12.740 --> 01:20:16.060]   Also that Atari VCS is weird.
[01:20:16.060 --> 01:20:23.460]   Who would pay $300 to play video games like we played in 1978?
[01:20:23.460 --> 01:20:28.180]   Yeah, I got the original 2600 recently.
[01:20:28.180 --> 01:20:29.180]   You know that?
[01:20:29.180 --> 01:20:30.180]   You have one?
[01:20:30.180 --> 01:20:31.180]   You have one?
[01:20:31.180 --> 01:20:32.180]   Oh, the $30 one.
[01:20:32.180 --> 01:20:33.820]   It's got all the games in it.
[01:20:33.820 --> 01:20:34.820]   Yeah.
[01:20:34.820 --> 01:20:39.420]   I played combat and I remember playing combat and having a good time and spending days playing
[01:20:39.420 --> 01:20:41.420]   it and I couldn't play it for 10 seconds.
[01:20:41.420 --> 01:20:42.420]   It's terrible.
[01:20:42.420 --> 01:20:44.660]   It was the slowest worst thing ever.
[01:20:44.660 --> 01:20:45.900]   It's so terrible.
[01:20:45.900 --> 01:20:50.060]   But I have to say I got that for our 15-year-old for Christmas.
[01:20:50.060 --> 01:20:51.580]   It was the number one Christmas gift.
[01:20:51.580 --> 01:20:53.180]   I noticed he doesn't play it anymore.
[01:20:53.180 --> 01:20:57.340]   At the time, he was very, very excited about it.
[01:20:57.340 --> 01:20:58.340]   Apparently there's...
[01:20:58.340 --> 01:21:01.780]   I would be called me getting a black and white TV with rabbit ears.
[01:21:01.780 --> 01:21:02.780]   It's so weird.
[01:21:02.780 --> 01:21:03.780]   Back to my childhood.
[01:21:03.780 --> 01:21:05.780]   So people are paying...
[01:21:05.780 --> 01:21:07.780]   Hey, you have to...
[01:21:07.780 --> 01:21:08.780]   You have to...
[01:21:08.780 --> 01:21:09.780]   You have to...
[01:21:09.780 --> 01:21:10.780]   You have to...
[01:21:10.780 --> 01:21:12.780]   The hand is really creepy.
[01:21:12.780 --> 01:21:13.780]   That is...
[01:21:13.780 --> 01:21:19.620]   I just want to say that is really a creepy hand because it's very...
[01:21:19.620 --> 01:21:21.140]   It's like a little baby hand.
[01:21:21.140 --> 01:21:22.140]   It's...
[01:21:22.140 --> 01:21:23.140]   I don't know.
[01:21:23.140 --> 01:21:26.460]   For people listening and you're really missing nothing.
[01:21:26.460 --> 01:21:32.820]   It's just a creepy little baby hand on a stick.
[01:21:32.820 --> 01:21:35.340]   So yeah, stop it.
[01:21:35.340 --> 01:21:39.860]   $299 for this collector's edition.
[01:21:39.860 --> 01:21:43.740]   And if you want the joystick, $29.
[01:21:43.740 --> 01:21:44.740]   That's crazy.
[01:21:44.740 --> 01:21:47.740]   Yeah, but if you live in San Francisco, you probably spend that on a good night out on
[01:21:47.740 --> 01:21:48.740]   the booze.
[01:21:48.740 --> 01:21:49.740]   Easily.
[01:21:49.740 --> 01:21:52.580]   Yeah, $200 doesn't get what it used to.
[01:21:52.580 --> 01:21:58.700]   If you're a Silicon Valley-side person and you're taking down 250,000 a year for a scutt
[01:21:58.700 --> 01:22:03.580]   work day job, like you get in Silicon Valley, then 300 bucks is 70.
[01:22:03.580 --> 01:22:04.580]   Nothing.
[01:22:04.580 --> 01:22:05.580]   Nothing.
[01:22:05.580 --> 01:22:06.580]   Nothing.
[01:22:06.580 --> 01:22:07.580]   Chicken feed.
[01:22:07.580 --> 01:22:11.860]   Did you see the protesters in San Francisco?
[01:22:11.860 --> 01:22:16.780]   So there's several things to protest these days in San Francisco.
[01:22:16.780 --> 01:22:20.220]   One of course is the fact that housing prices are through the roof.
[01:22:20.220 --> 01:22:25.300]   Nobody can afford to live there anymore because they say because of the tech bros and all
[01:22:25.300 --> 01:22:27.900]   the companies and the housing crisis.
[01:22:27.900 --> 01:22:29.980]   And so there's people upset about that.
[01:22:29.980 --> 01:22:31.620]   And then there's these scooters.
[01:22:31.620 --> 01:22:33.620]   Oh, God.
[01:22:33.620 --> 01:22:34.620]   Bird.
[01:22:34.620 --> 01:22:35.620]   Death traps.
[01:22:35.620 --> 01:22:36.620]   Everywhere.
[01:22:36.620 --> 01:22:39.180]   So they're everywhere.
[01:22:39.180 --> 01:22:42.220]   I first saw them in Santa Monica.
[01:22:42.220 --> 01:22:43.900]   And it is bad because...
[01:22:43.900 --> 01:22:44.900]   Mine.
[01:22:44.900 --> 01:22:45.900]   Yeah.
[01:22:45.900 --> 01:22:46.900]   People ride the scooter.
[01:22:46.900 --> 01:22:47.900]   It's three bucks to ride it.
[01:22:47.900 --> 01:22:49.300]   You use your phone to activate it.
[01:22:49.300 --> 01:22:51.060]   You go, you get to where you're going.
[01:22:51.060 --> 01:22:55.140]   And then you just hop off and then you leave the scooter and there's scooters everywhere.
[01:22:55.140 --> 01:23:01.700]   So in San Francisco, protesters decided to combine the two.
[01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:09.620]   And they piled a bunch of scooters up in front of the Google bus or one of the buses.
[01:23:09.620 --> 01:23:11.500]   Did you know that there are over 50?
[01:23:11.500 --> 01:23:12.820]   Set them on fire.
[01:23:12.820 --> 01:23:14.500]   Oh, no.
[01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:16.740]   And no, actually that's a fake fire.
[01:23:16.740 --> 01:23:19.140]   They didn't actually destroy anything.
[01:23:19.140 --> 01:23:21.020]   But that's very simple.
[01:23:21.020 --> 01:23:22.020]   It just flares.
[01:23:22.020 --> 01:23:23.020]   It just flares.
[01:23:23.020 --> 01:23:24.820]   But it's very simple.
[01:23:24.820 --> 01:23:25.820]   It's good.
[01:23:25.820 --> 01:23:27.860]   Have you ever ridden one of those scooters?
[01:23:27.860 --> 01:23:28.780]   They look deadly.
[01:23:28.780 --> 01:23:31.860]   I actually own a couple of them.
[01:23:31.860 --> 01:23:33.660]   They are deadly for people our age.
[01:23:33.660 --> 01:23:35.140]   Bad idea.
[01:23:35.140 --> 01:23:37.740]   But if you're a kid, you're used to it.
[01:23:37.740 --> 01:23:41.860]   The key is the problem is they have these electric motors that are super high to work.
[01:23:41.860 --> 01:23:42.860]   They're fast.
[01:23:42.860 --> 01:23:43.860]   Yeah.
[01:23:43.860 --> 01:23:44.860]   They're not just fast.
[01:23:44.860 --> 01:23:45.860]   You press the button and they go, whoa!
[01:23:45.860 --> 01:23:48.420]   It's like a buck in Bronco.
[01:23:48.420 --> 01:23:53.700]   So you really have to learn that you get the scooter going with your foot like a real scooter.
[01:23:53.700 --> 01:23:56.860]   And then you very carefully, gently, depress the trigger.
[01:23:56.860 --> 01:23:57.860]   Otherwise...
[01:23:57.860 --> 01:23:58.860]   But it's a rental.
[01:23:58.860 --> 01:23:59.860]   Who knows?
[01:23:59.860 --> 01:24:00.860]   How do you know that when you put your $3 down?
[01:24:00.860 --> 01:24:01.860]   Well, that's right.
[01:24:01.860 --> 01:24:02.860]   You've been on it before.
[01:24:02.860 --> 01:24:05.340]   Well, the learning curve is steep.
[01:24:05.340 --> 01:24:07.700]   You learn quickly.
[01:24:07.700 --> 01:24:13.300]   There's also, as long as we're talking scooters, a whole new business turns out these scooter
[01:24:13.300 --> 01:24:18.260]   companies will pay people as much as $15 to charge the scooter.
[01:24:18.260 --> 01:24:20.420]   That's the problem they have, right?
[01:24:20.420 --> 01:24:21.420]   Nobody's just riding them.
[01:24:21.420 --> 01:24:22.420]   Nobody's charging them.
[01:24:22.420 --> 01:24:27.460]   So high school kids who come around gathering scooters and bringing them to somewhere they
[01:24:27.460 --> 01:24:30.580]   can plug them in for pocket money.
[01:24:30.580 --> 01:24:31.580]   Actually pretty good money.
[01:24:31.580 --> 01:24:34.420]   One of those Atari VCS's for that.
[01:24:34.420 --> 01:24:37.820]   A good day's work will get you an Atari.
[01:24:37.820 --> 01:24:38.820]   Is that what you're saying?
[01:24:38.820 --> 01:24:39.820]   Yeah.
[01:24:39.820 --> 01:24:42.900]   It's a weird model, for sure.
[01:24:42.900 --> 01:24:43.900]   It's crazy.
[01:24:43.900 --> 01:24:48.180]   But the idea that you could just pick up a scooter outside of whatever building you're
[01:24:48.180 --> 01:24:49.180]   at.
[01:24:49.180 --> 01:24:50.180]   It's awesome.
[01:24:50.180 --> 01:24:51.180]   And go to another building.
[01:24:51.180 --> 01:24:52.180]   There is some...
[01:24:52.180 --> 01:24:53.180]   Oh, it's awesome.
[01:24:53.180 --> 01:24:55.380]   I have a feeling there's going to be a problem.
[01:24:55.380 --> 01:24:59.340]   So I was in Seattle recently and they've got these bikes, similar thing with bikes.
[01:24:59.340 --> 01:25:00.860]   I found bikes everywhere.
[01:25:00.860 --> 01:25:02.020]   I mean, in residential neighborhoods.
[01:25:02.020 --> 01:25:03.020]   Oh, you can't...
[01:25:03.020 --> 01:25:05.180]   It's not like the city bikes where you have to dock it and the bike.
[01:25:05.180 --> 01:25:07.860]   No, they're dockless bikes and the problem is people leave them.
[01:25:07.860 --> 01:25:12.100]   They take them home to the suburbs where they live where nobody is going to want to rent
[01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:13.100]   it.
[01:25:13.100 --> 01:25:16.100]   And so they're just sitting around in these odd random places.
[01:25:16.100 --> 01:25:20.900]   And I saw one near my hotel and it was there for the whole time I was in Seattle three
[01:25:20.900 --> 01:25:22.060]   days.
[01:25:22.060 --> 01:25:26.660]   That bike was still in the same exact spot because where I was staying, I guess nobody
[01:25:26.660 --> 01:25:28.260]   wanted to rent a bike.
[01:25:28.260 --> 01:25:30.020]   So I don't know what this is going to work.
[01:25:30.020 --> 01:25:33.940]   No, in fact, I think this probably started with Google, right?
[01:25:33.940 --> 01:25:36.660]   Because the Google has bikes in front of every building.
[01:25:36.660 --> 01:25:38.300]   You're in a different place.
[01:25:38.300 --> 01:25:44.140]   But they lose according to a bicycling magazine more than a thousand...
[01:25:44.140 --> 01:25:46.740]   Hundreds of more than a hundred bikes every week disappear.
[01:25:46.740 --> 01:25:47.740]   Wow.
[01:25:47.740 --> 01:25:48.740]   Yeah.
[01:25:48.740 --> 01:25:49.740]   And permanently.
[01:25:49.740 --> 01:25:50.740]   People just throw them in rivers.
[01:25:50.740 --> 01:25:53.340]   The challenge has been that they throw them in the river or the dumpsters.
[01:25:53.340 --> 01:25:54.340]   And that's the other problem.
[01:25:54.340 --> 01:25:56.300]   Yeah, you still don't have river in Silicon Valley.
[01:25:56.300 --> 01:25:57.300]   And then...
[01:25:57.300 --> 01:25:58.780]   No, there's a creek full of Google bikes.
[01:25:58.780 --> 01:25:59.780]   I have a picture.
[01:25:59.780 --> 01:26:04.900]   If you have an event like a concert or something, people just ride up on it and then just start
[01:26:04.900 --> 01:26:06.940]   throwing them on top of the other bikes.
[01:26:06.940 --> 01:26:11.660]   And then you actually find emergency exits all blocked up with bikes piled up.
[01:26:11.660 --> 01:26:13.180]   And then they...
[01:26:13.180 --> 01:26:16.780]   What do you do when you've got 5,000 bikes piled up outside of a concert hall?
[01:26:16.780 --> 01:26:19.420]   In the 60s, there was a group called the Provo of an Amsterdam.
[01:26:19.420 --> 01:26:21.460]   I think it was an anarchist collective.
[01:26:21.460 --> 01:26:25.500]   And they actually bought these bikes and put them all over Amsterdam with this great sort
[01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:26.500]   of social...
[01:26:26.500 --> 01:26:27.740]   Amsterdam is very bike friendly.
[01:26:27.740 --> 01:26:32.380]   Yeah, but it didn't last because these bikes basically were stolen.
[01:26:32.380 --> 01:26:34.820]   But it was a great idealistic concept for a while.
[01:26:34.820 --> 01:26:35.820]   Yeah.
[01:26:35.820 --> 01:26:41.020]   The remedy though, like the remedy to this is that you build infrastructure and you put
[01:26:41.020 --> 01:26:43.020]   bike parking lots outside of every building.
[01:26:43.020 --> 01:26:44.020]   I agree.
[01:26:44.020 --> 01:26:47.380]   Frankly, it's not such a crazy idea.
[01:26:47.380 --> 01:26:50.540]   I very much enjoy getting around city sun bikes.
[01:26:50.540 --> 01:26:52.100]   Or electric scooters.
[01:26:52.100 --> 01:26:54.460]   I mean, it really beats the traffic.
[01:26:54.460 --> 01:26:58.180]   The problem is people ride them on the sidewalk.
[01:26:58.180 --> 01:26:59.180]   They ride them irresponsibly.
[01:26:59.180 --> 01:27:04.740]   And then the scooter companies say, "Well, it's not our fault.
[01:27:04.740 --> 01:27:06.140]   People are not obeying the law.
[01:27:06.140 --> 01:27:08.140]   They're not wearing their helmets or they're not...
[01:27:08.140 --> 01:27:10.700]   But there is some responsibility to the gozels.
[01:27:10.700 --> 01:27:12.700]   The problem is when you rent a bike, it's hard to...
[01:27:12.700 --> 01:27:15.100]   They don't include helmets with the bike.
[01:27:15.100 --> 01:27:17.180]   So that's a tough one.
[01:27:17.180 --> 01:27:20.740]   In fact, New York City had a law that you had to rent a helmet, but the New York was
[01:27:20.740 --> 01:27:22.380]   actually sanctioning bikes.
[01:27:22.380 --> 01:27:25.700]   They don't want to do these bike things in New York where you can't get a helmet.
[01:27:25.700 --> 01:27:30.660]   So they had to modify the law, as I understand it, so people who rented the bikes could legally
[01:27:30.660 --> 01:27:32.380]   ride them without helmets.
[01:27:32.380 --> 01:27:33.860]   That's one way to solve it.
[01:27:33.860 --> 01:27:34.860]   Yeah.
[01:27:34.860 --> 01:27:35.860]   I have told the bike.
[01:27:35.860 --> 01:27:37.860]   They ended up just becoming a leader though.
[01:27:37.860 --> 01:27:38.860]   Traveling.
[01:27:38.860 --> 01:27:42.820]   That's what these bird scooters in Santa Monica, they were just strewn everywhere.
[01:27:42.820 --> 01:27:46.060]   San Francisco might even be worse because there's several...
[01:27:46.060 --> 01:27:50.340]   There's like two bird will be there, but other companies in Lyft has just gotten approval
[01:27:50.340 --> 01:27:51.340]   to do bikes there.
[01:27:51.340 --> 01:27:55.300]   San Francisco government of San Francisco, I don't know what it's called, a council
[01:27:55.300 --> 01:27:56.300]   city council.
[01:27:56.300 --> 01:27:57.300]   Supervisors.
[01:27:57.300 --> 01:27:58.300]   The board of Supervisors.
[01:27:58.300 --> 01:28:02.100]   They've just announced that they're only going to license four scooter companies and
[01:28:02.100 --> 01:28:04.060]   they're going to put a whole bunch of conditions on them.
[01:28:04.060 --> 01:28:07.580]   So a couple of scooter companies have just gone out of business because they didn't make
[01:28:07.580 --> 01:28:08.580]   the cut.
[01:28:08.580 --> 01:28:13.580]   On the other hand, I have to say, driving in San Francisco downtown San Francisco is a
[01:28:13.580 --> 01:28:14.580]   nightmare.
[01:28:14.580 --> 01:28:17.780]   The city is not friendly to cars.
[01:28:17.780 --> 01:28:18.780]   They'll tow you.
[01:28:18.780 --> 01:28:20.420]   The tickets are huge.
[01:28:20.420 --> 01:28:21.820]   There's very little parking.
[01:28:21.820 --> 01:28:23.700]   It's not designed to be friendly for cars.
[01:28:23.700 --> 01:28:29.380]   I think really this is the first step maybe towards making urban areas a car-free zone,
[01:28:29.380 --> 01:28:31.220]   which I don't think would be a bad thing at all.
[01:28:31.220 --> 01:28:32.740]   I'm trying to think of...
[01:28:32.740 --> 01:28:34.860]   There's an email that I get every week.
[01:28:34.860 --> 01:28:36.740]   It's a French analyst.
[01:28:36.740 --> 01:28:42.340]   And he's predicting that this idea of micro-mobility is going to be the next biggest wave.
[01:28:42.340 --> 01:28:47.380]   What he's trying to point out is that 80% of all journeys are like one to five kilometers
[01:28:47.380 --> 01:28:48.380]   long.
[01:28:48.380 --> 01:28:50.220]   So why are you owning a car?
[01:28:50.220 --> 01:28:51.980]   You don't really want a self-driving car.
[01:28:51.980 --> 01:28:54.900]   You just want something that's better than walking or whatever.
[01:28:54.900 --> 01:29:00.340]   So this idea of hiring a scooter or a bicycle does, especially in Europe, where a lot of
[01:29:00.340 --> 01:29:04.220]   the streets are driving a car's pointless most of the time.
[01:29:04.220 --> 01:29:07.700]   In London, for example, you spend more time getting down to the tube than you spend on
[01:29:07.700 --> 01:29:08.700]   the tube.
[01:29:08.700 --> 01:29:11.740]   It'd be a lot easier on a good day to just ride in a beautiful point.
[01:29:11.740 --> 01:29:16.100]   But you need to be pretty careful about making sure cyclists stay off the sidewalk.
[01:29:16.100 --> 01:29:21.380]   In Japan, I was in Japan a couple of weeks ago, and people ride bikes on the sidewalk
[01:29:21.380 --> 01:29:24.100]   everywhere, and they ride it at full speed.
[01:29:24.100 --> 01:29:25.100]   It's kind of terrifying.
[01:29:25.100 --> 01:29:26.100]   Nobody seems to get hit.
[01:29:26.100 --> 01:29:29.140]   Everybody seems to coexist, but it's kind of scary.
[01:29:29.140 --> 01:29:33.580]   The irony is that the biggest sponsor of the bikes in San Francisco is Ford, which is
[01:29:33.580 --> 01:29:35.260]   calling itself a mobility company.
[01:29:35.260 --> 01:29:39.860]   They actually see this as part of their strategy on how they're going to survive with the
[01:29:39.860 --> 01:29:45.820]   current young generation, the people who are not buying two cars per family like my generation
[01:29:45.820 --> 01:29:46.820]   did.
[01:29:46.820 --> 01:29:51.700]   Bikes are sort of the last mile in Ford's strategy, I think.
[01:29:51.700 --> 01:29:56.260]   I'm only a couple miles from work, and I would segue or bicycle or scooter to work,
[01:29:56.260 --> 01:29:57.980]   except that there's no good way to go.
[01:29:57.980 --> 01:29:59.980]   Did you say segue?
[01:29:59.980 --> 01:30:02.580]   We happen to own a segue or two, yeah.
[01:30:02.580 --> 01:30:03.580]   Oh, OK.
[01:30:03.580 --> 01:30:05.580]   That's where they went.
[01:30:05.580 --> 01:30:09.220]   I love my segues.
[01:30:09.220 --> 01:30:17.020]   OK, I admit, it looks like an idiot on it, especially with my pink shorts, but as you
[01:30:17.020 --> 01:30:19.660]   can see, I have no pride.
[01:30:19.660 --> 01:30:20.660]   I know.
[01:30:20.660 --> 01:30:22.540]   What was I say?
[01:30:22.540 --> 01:30:25.220]   Oh, but the infrastructure doesn't support it.
[01:30:25.220 --> 01:30:29.380]   The only ways to go is through heavily trafficked quarters that I just don't feel safe riding.
[01:30:29.380 --> 01:30:30.380]   So that's part of it.
[01:30:30.380 --> 01:30:31.380]   I think you're right, Seth.
[01:30:31.380 --> 01:30:37.220]   If cities want to make it welcoming to these things, that would be on balance a good thing,
[01:30:37.220 --> 01:30:41.420]   I think, but they have to do that instead of just saying, "You can't, you know, you guys,
[01:30:41.420 --> 01:30:44.020]   you kids, get off of my lawn with your scooters."
[01:30:44.020 --> 01:30:46.980]   The other thing is they can make scooters a lot lighter.
[01:30:46.980 --> 01:30:51.220]   If they can make them a little bit lighter, I guess, then they can become personal and
[01:30:51.220 --> 01:30:55.020]   you can, you know, carry your backpack around with it.
[01:30:55.020 --> 01:30:58.220]   Our son, I'm so proud of him.
[01:30:58.220 --> 01:31:02.860]   He goes to school pretty far away, like 20 miles away, his high school.
[01:31:02.860 --> 01:31:05.260]   He takes the smart train.
[01:31:05.260 --> 01:31:08.420]   There's a light rail from Petaluma to San Rafael.
[01:31:08.420 --> 01:31:11.380]   He carries a folded up electric scooter with him.
[01:31:11.380 --> 01:31:16.620]   He gets off the smart train and scooters to school a mile and a half to school.
[01:31:16.620 --> 01:31:18.220]   Scooters back to the train rides the train home.
[01:31:18.220 --> 01:31:19.220]   That's great.
[01:31:19.220 --> 01:31:20.220]   Isn't that awesome?
[01:31:20.220 --> 01:31:21.220]   And that's not even an urban area.
[01:31:21.220 --> 01:31:22.900]   We're rural California.
[01:31:22.900 --> 01:31:23.900]   Yeah.
[01:31:23.900 --> 01:31:24.900]   That's the future.
[01:31:24.900 --> 01:31:25.900]   I love it.
[01:31:25.900 --> 01:31:29.940]   I have a fold up bike, which is not quite small enough to take on an airplane, but I can keep
[01:31:29.940 --> 01:31:31.700]   it in the back of my car.
[01:31:31.700 --> 01:31:34.460]   And when I go into San Francisco, I often just park anywhere.
[01:31:34.460 --> 01:31:35.460]   That's a great idea.
[01:31:35.460 --> 01:31:37.660]   Take the bike out of the back of the car.
[01:31:37.660 --> 01:31:39.220]   There was a service in San Francisco.
[01:31:39.220 --> 01:31:42.060]   I bet they're out of business right now.
[01:31:42.060 --> 01:31:43.060]   You press a button.
[01:31:43.060 --> 01:31:45.060]   It was a valet car service.
[01:31:45.060 --> 01:31:47.620]   You just say where you want it to be.
[01:31:47.620 --> 01:31:50.180]   The guy would ride a scooter up to you.
[01:31:50.180 --> 01:31:51.180]   All right.
[01:31:51.180 --> 01:31:52.180]   Get in the car.
[01:31:52.180 --> 01:31:53.180]   Park it.
[01:31:53.180 --> 01:31:54.180]   And then he'd bring it to you when you were done.
[01:31:54.180 --> 01:31:55.740]   So you didn't have to worry.
[01:31:55.740 --> 01:31:56.740]   It's beautiful fences.
[01:31:56.740 --> 01:31:57.740]   Isn't that great?
[01:31:57.740 --> 01:31:59.660]   In a sense, that's what driverless cars are all about, right?
[01:31:59.660 --> 01:32:03.820]   The idea of the autonomous vehicle is going to pick you up, drop you off, and go find
[01:32:03.820 --> 01:32:05.660]   a place to park if you own it.
[01:32:05.660 --> 01:32:09.420]   Or it'll go take someone else for a ride if it's a fleet car.
[01:32:09.420 --> 01:32:10.700]   That's a future I look forward to.
[01:32:10.700 --> 01:32:11.700]   I think that's it.
[01:32:11.700 --> 01:32:15.060]   Or maybe even if you do own it, maybe you could make some money.
[01:32:15.060 --> 01:32:18.860]   Even if you own the car, why can't you get paid to have it drive somebody else around
[01:32:18.860 --> 01:32:22.100]   while you're in your meeting or at work?
[01:32:22.100 --> 01:32:24.340]   Let's take a little time out.
[01:32:24.340 --> 01:32:25.340]   We'll come back with more.
[01:32:25.340 --> 01:32:26.340]   We've got a great panel.
[01:32:26.340 --> 01:32:27.620]   Larry Maggot is here.
[01:32:27.620 --> 01:32:28.620]   CBS News Radio.
[01:32:28.620 --> 01:32:29.620]   Always a thrill.
[01:32:29.620 --> 01:32:30.620]   How's your back?
[01:32:30.620 --> 01:32:31.620]   Feeling all right?
[01:32:31.620 --> 01:32:32.620]   It's all right.
[01:32:32.620 --> 01:32:34.180]   I love your brakes because they gave me a chance to switch.
[01:32:34.180 --> 01:32:35.180]   Take a walk.
[01:32:35.180 --> 01:32:36.180]   Take a hike.
[01:32:36.180 --> 01:32:37.180]   You make money.
[01:32:37.180 --> 01:32:38.180]   I get my back really quickly.
[01:32:38.180 --> 01:32:39.180]   It's a beautiful thing.
[01:32:39.180 --> 01:32:40.180]   It's a win-win.
[01:32:40.180 --> 01:32:41.180]   Seth Wine-Troubs here.
[01:32:41.180 --> 01:32:47.300]   He is, of course, the founder and publisher of 9 to 5 Mac, 9 to 5 Google.
[01:32:47.300 --> 01:32:50.620]   And Electric.com is his electric car publication.
[01:32:50.620 --> 01:32:52.620]   I think your heart's in that one for some reason.
[01:32:52.620 --> 01:32:54.420]   I feel like that, Seth.
[01:32:54.420 --> 01:32:56.660]   It's the latest of my baby.
[01:32:56.660 --> 01:32:58.660]   Yeah.
[01:32:58.660 --> 01:33:02.020]   And the new one, which is Drown DJ.
[01:33:02.020 --> 01:33:03.020]   DrownDJ.com.
[01:33:03.020 --> 01:33:04.020]   Right.
[01:33:04.020 --> 01:33:05.980]   It's not just DJIs, though.
[01:33:05.980 --> 01:33:07.660]   It's all drones.
[01:33:07.660 --> 01:33:12.820]   It's all drones, but you kind of think about DJI because they're 80% of the market.
[01:33:12.820 --> 01:33:13.820]   They're the king of the hill.
[01:33:13.820 --> 01:33:15.260]   Are they that dominant?
[01:33:15.260 --> 01:33:16.260]   Wow.
[01:33:16.260 --> 01:33:17.260]   Yeah, the consumer space.
[01:33:17.260 --> 01:33:18.660]   I miss my Mavic Pro.
[01:33:18.660 --> 01:33:22.260]   I hope it's enjoying its retreat in the Caribbean.
[01:33:22.260 --> 01:33:24.460]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:33:24.460 --> 01:33:26.740]   Extended holiday for me.
[01:33:26.740 --> 01:33:27.740]   Extended holiday.
[01:33:27.740 --> 01:33:29.980]   Greg Ferro also here from the Packet Pushers Network.
[01:33:29.980 --> 01:33:31.420]   It's getting late, I know.
[01:33:31.420 --> 01:33:33.620]   So we're going to hurry and get you home.
[01:33:33.620 --> 01:33:34.620]   Oh, don't do that.
[01:33:34.620 --> 01:33:35.780]   We're having so much fun.
[01:33:35.780 --> 01:33:38.300]   I want to tell you what I cooked for dinner the other night.
[01:33:38.300 --> 01:33:39.300]   We've been having so much fun.
[01:33:39.300 --> 01:33:41.180]   You know we're big blue apron users.
[01:33:41.180 --> 01:33:46.060]   We usually do two or three blue apron menus a week.
[01:33:46.060 --> 01:33:52.220]   And oh, I made-- oh, there's a barbecue wings recipe that is so, so good.
[01:33:52.220 --> 01:33:54.220]   It's just mouthwater only good.
[01:33:54.220 --> 01:33:56.220]   And then what did I make the other day?
[01:33:56.220 --> 01:33:58.220]   It's just so much fun.
[01:33:58.220 --> 01:34:04.220]   Blue apron is the number one fresh ingredient recipe delivery service in the country.
[01:34:04.220 --> 01:34:06.220]   You don't have to worry about meal planning.
[01:34:06.220 --> 01:34:08.220]   You get straight to cooking with blue apron.
[01:34:08.220 --> 01:34:13.220]   You know, at the end of the day, you don't really want to plan, shop, and cook.
[01:34:13.220 --> 01:34:17.220]   But what if you went home and all the-- it's like you had a sous chef.
[01:34:17.220 --> 01:34:19.220]   All the ingredients you needed were there.
[01:34:19.220 --> 01:34:20.220]   Beautiful too.
[01:34:20.220 --> 01:34:22.220]   Just perfect.
[01:34:22.220 --> 01:34:26.220]   All ready to go, all you have to do is get out the pan and cook them.
[01:34:26.220 --> 01:34:29.220]   By the way, they're very sensitive about-- they very often reuse pans.
[01:34:29.220 --> 01:34:32.220]   What was it we cooked the other day that was so good, Lisa?
[01:34:32.220 --> 01:34:35.220]   Oh, the kung pao chicken was amazing.
[01:34:35.220 --> 01:34:40.220]   It even had a little kung pao pepper, the really hot Chinese peppers in there.
[01:34:40.220 --> 01:34:42.220]   Oh, it was so good.
[01:34:42.220 --> 01:34:44.220]   And so that's a perfect example.
[01:34:44.220 --> 01:34:48.220]   You know, if I bought a box of Chinese peppers,
[01:34:48.220 --> 01:34:53.220]   I would use it once and then I would have a box in my fridge for the rest of my life.
[01:34:53.220 --> 01:34:55.220]   But it comes with one.
[01:34:55.220 --> 01:34:56.220]   It's perfect.
[01:34:56.220 --> 01:34:57.220]   Just you need a little teaspoon of soy sauce.
[01:34:57.220 --> 01:34:58.220]   That's what you get.
[01:34:58.220 --> 01:35:01.220]   You get exactly the ingredients you need to make the recipe.
[01:35:01.220 --> 01:35:03.220]   And it's fun too.
[01:35:03.220 --> 01:35:04.220]   I made that.
[01:35:04.220 --> 01:35:05.220]   That one with the ramen bowl.
[01:35:05.220 --> 01:35:06.220]   I made that.
[01:35:06.220 --> 01:35:07.220]   Michael liked that.
[01:35:07.220 --> 01:35:09.220]   He didn't eat the hard boiled egg, but I did.
[01:35:09.220 --> 01:35:10.220]   I loved that.
[01:35:10.220 --> 01:35:12.220]   That was really-- oh, no, he did eat the hard boiled egg.
[01:35:12.220 --> 01:35:13.220]   Yeah.
[01:35:13.220 --> 01:35:14.220]   That was awesome.
[01:35:14.220 --> 01:35:15.220]   It's great when you have kids.
[01:35:15.220 --> 01:35:17.220]   They learned to cook.
[01:35:17.220 --> 01:35:18.220]   They participate.
[01:35:18.220 --> 01:35:19.820]   They get excited about the food.
[01:35:19.820 --> 01:35:21.220]   It's a really great skill for them.
[01:35:21.220 --> 01:35:22.220]   It's great for me.
[01:35:22.220 --> 01:35:23.220]   I like to cook.
[01:35:23.220 --> 01:35:27.220]   But I often cook the same thing over and over because I can't think of something new.
[01:35:27.220 --> 01:35:29.220]   Blue Apron gives me new horizons.
[01:35:29.220 --> 01:35:31.220]   We've been doing the Airbnb menu for a while.
[01:35:31.220 --> 01:35:35.220]   They were doing menus from Airbnb's all over the world we were doing.
[01:35:35.220 --> 01:35:38.220]   We did one from-- I think the kung pao chicken was from Shanghai.
[01:35:38.220 --> 01:35:41.220]   It was really, really good.
[01:35:41.220 --> 01:35:46.220]   Mediterranean food like seared salmon and spicy orange salsa.
[01:35:46.220 --> 01:35:49.220]   They're centered around fruits, veggies, lean meats, plenty of olive oil.
[01:35:49.220 --> 01:35:51.220]   You'll love the Mediterranean menu.
[01:35:51.220 --> 01:35:53.220]   They're nutritious but delicious.
[01:35:53.220 --> 01:35:56.220]   Chef-designed recipes.
[01:35:56.220 --> 01:35:58.220]   My mouth waters every time I do these ads.
[01:35:58.220 --> 01:35:59.220]   I go crazy.
[01:35:59.220 --> 01:36:04.220]   Blue Apron delivered fresh-- delivers fresh pre-proportion ingredients step-by-step recipes.
[01:36:04.220 --> 01:36:06.220]   Right to you, you choose what you want.
[01:36:06.220 --> 01:36:08.220]   They have 12 new recipes every week.
[01:36:08.220 --> 01:36:11.220]   You can choose two, three or four recipes based on what best fits your schedule.
[01:36:11.220 --> 01:36:13.220]   If you're not going to be home, you can delay.
[01:36:13.220 --> 01:36:15.220]   You don't have to get it every week.
[01:36:15.220 --> 01:36:18.220]   You can go out on non-GMO ingredients, meet with no added hormones.
[01:36:18.220 --> 01:36:20.220]   The Blue Apron menu changes every week.
[01:36:20.220 --> 01:36:22.220]   They won't repeat more than once a year.
[01:36:22.220 --> 01:36:24.220]   Do you see the Chrissy Teigen stuff?
[01:36:24.220 --> 01:36:25.220]   Look at that.
[01:36:25.220 --> 01:36:28.220]   Chrissy Teigen's sweet and spicy chicken lettuce cups.
[01:36:28.220 --> 01:36:29.220]   Look at that.
[01:36:29.220 --> 01:36:35.220]   They've teamed up with Chrissy Teigen best-selling cookbook author to bring you some of her favorite
[01:36:35.220 --> 01:36:36.220]   recipes to make at home.
[01:36:36.220 --> 01:36:38.220]   Get ready for six weeks.
[01:36:38.220 --> 01:36:40.220]   I love it that Blue Apron does things like this.
[01:36:40.220 --> 01:36:41.220]   These events are so much fun.
[01:36:41.220 --> 01:36:46.220]   They're a lot of wildly fun, flavorful cooking featuring recipes like garlic and soy glaze
[01:36:46.220 --> 01:36:49.220]   shrimp with charred broccoli and hot green pepper sauce.
[01:36:49.220 --> 01:36:52.220]   By the way, that's a new thing I've been doing.
[01:36:52.220 --> 01:36:57.220]   You do something like that, so instead of steaming the broccoli, we put it in the toast
[01:36:57.220 --> 01:36:58.220]   drive and charred it.
[01:36:58.220 --> 01:36:59.220]   It was so good.
[01:36:59.220 --> 01:37:01.220]   That's how we make broccoli now.
[01:37:01.220 --> 01:37:03.220]   We learned it from Blue Apron.
[01:37:03.220 --> 01:37:05.220]   Sesame chicken noodles with bok choy.
[01:37:05.220 --> 01:37:06.220]   Blue Apron.
[01:37:06.220 --> 01:37:07.220]   I love it.
[01:37:07.220 --> 01:37:08.220]   Check out this week's menu.
[01:37:08.220 --> 01:37:13.220]   First meals, first three meals free with free shipping at Blue Apron.com/twit.
[01:37:13.220 --> 01:37:14.220]   That's pretty good.
[01:37:14.220 --> 01:37:16.220]   Three meals free with free shipping.
[01:37:16.220 --> 01:37:19.220]   Blue Apron.com/twit.
[01:37:19.220 --> 01:37:24.220]   Blue Apron is a better way to cook and I hope I didn't make you all hungry.
[01:37:24.220 --> 01:37:25.220]   Starring.
[01:37:25.220 --> 01:37:28.220]   Yeah, me too.
[01:37:28.220 --> 01:37:29.220]   New emojis are here.
[01:37:29.220 --> 01:37:30.220]   The new emojis are here.
[01:37:30.220 --> 01:37:31.220]   Are you ready?
[01:37:31.220 --> 01:37:33.220]   Are you excited?
[01:37:33.220 --> 01:37:39.220]   Here's from the emoji committee of the, oh, actually it's Jeremy who's on the emoji committee.
[01:37:39.220 --> 01:37:41.220]   He's at emoji Pedia.
[01:37:41.220 --> 01:37:45.220]   The brand new emojis pleading face.
[01:37:45.220 --> 01:37:47.220]   Woozy face.
[01:37:47.220 --> 01:37:49.220]   Smiling with three hearts.
[01:37:49.220 --> 01:37:52.220]   Hot and cold face.
[01:37:52.220 --> 01:37:54.220]   Those are red-haired people.
[01:37:54.220 --> 01:37:57.220]   Apparently they haven't had those in the past.
[01:37:57.220 --> 01:37:58.220]   Curly-haired people.
[01:37:58.220 --> 01:38:00.220]   All the curly-haired people are happy.
[01:38:00.220 --> 01:38:02.220]   And finally, for people like me.
[01:38:02.220 --> 01:38:03.220]   White-haired people.
[01:38:03.220 --> 01:38:04.220]   Plus bald.
[01:38:04.220 --> 01:38:06.220]   Gotta have bald people.
[01:38:06.220 --> 01:38:08.220]   No hair at all.
[01:38:08.220 --> 01:38:09.220]   Super villain.
[01:38:09.220 --> 01:38:11.220]   Male or female.
[01:38:11.220 --> 01:38:12.220]   Super hero also.
[01:38:12.220 --> 01:38:15.220]   Male or female.
[01:38:15.220 --> 01:38:22.220]   Kind of strangely weirdly disembodied, body parts like a leg and a foot.
[01:38:22.220 --> 01:38:27.220]   But if you think that's weird, there's also a tooth and a bone.
[01:38:27.220 --> 01:38:28.220]   Ew.
[01:38:28.220 --> 01:38:34.740]   Goggles in a lab coat if you're into science like Ivanka Trump, hiking boots, women's flat
[01:38:34.740 --> 01:38:35.740]   shoes.
[01:38:35.740 --> 01:38:37.220]   There's a microbe.
[01:38:37.220 --> 01:38:40.220]   Mosquito, parrot.
[01:38:40.220 --> 01:38:41.220]   Badger.
[01:38:41.220 --> 01:38:42.220]   That's not a skunk.
[01:38:42.220 --> 01:38:43.220]   That's a badger.
[01:38:43.220 --> 01:38:44.220]   Peacock, raccoon.
[01:38:44.220 --> 01:38:46.220]   Again, not a skunk.
[01:38:46.220 --> 01:38:48.220]   Swan, kangaroo and lobster.
[01:38:48.220 --> 01:38:49.220]   The skunk law.
[01:38:49.220 --> 01:38:52.500]   Oh, I gotta point out though, we mentioned this when they first proposed it.
[01:38:52.500 --> 01:38:55.420]   That is not a uncooked lobster.
[01:38:55.420 --> 01:38:57.140]   Lobsters are not red.
[01:38:57.140 --> 01:38:59.140]   That is a cooked lobster.
[01:38:59.140 --> 01:39:02.140]   You think that's gonna be controversial?
[01:39:02.140 --> 01:39:04.140]   It has to be.
[01:39:04.140 --> 01:39:06.140]   It has to be.
[01:39:06.140 --> 01:39:07.140]   Everything's controversial.
[01:39:07.140 --> 01:39:09.700]   Strangely prancing hippopotamus.
[01:39:09.700 --> 01:39:15.340]   Now these are the proposed, these are kind of the, these are not necessarily what you'll
[01:39:15.340 --> 01:39:17.940]   get from Facebook or Google or Twitter or Apple.
[01:39:17.940 --> 01:39:19.460]   They do their own.
[01:39:19.460 --> 01:39:25.540]   They'll have a hippopotamus, but it won't necessarily be the prancing, fancy pants hippopotamus
[01:39:25.540 --> 01:39:28.900]   that the folks at Unicode have proposed.
[01:39:28.900 --> 01:39:29.900]   There's a llama.
[01:39:29.900 --> 01:39:30.900]   And a change.
[01:39:30.900 --> 01:39:31.900]   Should they have their own emoji?
[01:39:31.900 --> 01:39:32.900]   Who?
[01:39:32.900 --> 01:39:34.380]   People who deny climate change.
[01:39:34.380 --> 01:39:36.220]   Should they get their own emoji?
[01:39:36.220 --> 01:39:38.180]   It's called moon cake.
[01:39:38.180 --> 01:39:39.180]   Okay.
[01:39:39.180 --> 01:39:41.620]   Compass luggage.
[01:39:41.620 --> 01:39:42.620]   Brics and skateboard.
[01:39:42.620 --> 01:39:44.980]   There's something for everybody.
[01:39:44.980 --> 01:39:46.860]   Flying disc, not a Frisbee note.
[01:39:46.860 --> 01:39:48.100]   That would be a trademark violation.
[01:39:48.100 --> 01:39:51.300]   A pawn, a softball, a jigsaw, toolbox magnet.
[01:39:51.300 --> 01:39:52.300]   A magnet.
[01:39:52.300 --> 01:39:55.060]   It's really, yeah, your board.
[01:39:55.060 --> 01:39:56.060]   Yeah.
[01:39:56.060 --> 01:39:57.060]   You don't.
[01:39:57.060 --> 01:39:58.460]   That's because you're old.
[01:39:58.460 --> 01:40:02.600]   Young people, emojis are so very important to them.
[01:40:02.600 --> 01:40:03.600]   That's how they're promoting.
[01:40:03.600 --> 01:40:04.600]   It's like hieroglyphics.
[01:40:04.600 --> 01:40:05.600]   Yeah.
[01:40:05.600 --> 01:40:06.600]   Yeah.
[01:40:06.600 --> 01:40:07.600]   That's great.
[01:40:07.600 --> 01:40:09.600]   Keep up the good work.
[01:40:09.600 --> 01:40:15.520]   Well, isn't the, isn't the Chinese alphabet sort of just a whole series of emojis in a
[01:40:15.520 --> 01:40:16.520]   way?
[01:40:16.520 --> 01:40:17.520]   I guess it is, isn't it?
[01:40:17.520 --> 01:40:18.520]   You know.
[01:40:18.520 --> 01:40:19.520]   It's, it's, it's, they got it right.
[01:40:19.520 --> 01:40:20.520]   Works them.
[01:40:20.520 --> 01:40:21.520]   Pick pictograms, they call it.
[01:40:21.520 --> 01:40:22.520]   Yeah.
[01:40:22.520 --> 01:40:23.520]   Yeah.
[01:40:23.520 --> 01:40:24.520]   Yeah.
[01:40:24.520 --> 01:40:27.680]   I don't know about this picture that the AP has put out.
[01:40:27.680 --> 01:40:33.100]   I don't know who these people are, but the story is a hacker gets five years for Russian-linked
[01:40:33.100 --> 01:40:34.100]   Yahoo!
[01:40:34.100 --> 01:40:36.100]   Security breach.
[01:40:36.100 --> 01:40:39.900]   Kareem Bharatov was fined a quarter of a million dollars.
[01:40:39.900 --> 01:40:41.160]   I think that's the judge.
[01:40:41.160 --> 01:40:42.160]   I don't know.
[01:40:42.160 --> 01:40:45.500]   Like, no, it says US judge and that's clearly not a US judge.
[01:40:45.500 --> 01:40:49.000]   I know this picture doesn't seem to make any sense.
[01:40:49.000 --> 01:40:50.700]   I couldn't make any sense of it.
[01:40:50.700 --> 01:40:51.700]   I don't know what it's worth.
[01:40:51.700 --> 01:40:53.000]   Who are these people?
[01:40:53.000 --> 01:40:54.000]   It's not Kareem.
[01:40:54.000 --> 01:40:55.000]   He's a young guy.
[01:40:55.000 --> 01:40:56.000]   He's 23.
[01:40:56.000 --> 01:40:57.920]   I don't see him in the picture.
[01:40:57.920 --> 01:41:02.000]   Maybe he's the, maybe he, maybe a little like with an bar, but I don't know.
[01:41:02.000 --> 01:41:03.000]   Yeah.
[01:41:03.000 --> 01:41:04.640]   Maybe that I don't know what's going on in this picture.
[01:41:04.640 --> 01:41:08.720]   I wasn't the person in the middle at the back.
[01:41:08.720 --> 01:41:14.080]   It's, you think that this whole picture really that this guy is the, is the, is the perp and
[01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:16.960]   the rest of it, they couldn't get a clear shot.
[01:41:16.960 --> 01:41:18.160]   That's the parents and the lawyer.
[01:41:18.160 --> 01:41:22.400]   And the barrister because it was in the, it wasn't Canada, right?
[01:41:22.400 --> 01:41:23.400]   Yeah.
[01:41:23.400 --> 01:41:28.120]   Which case they didn't do a very good job with the iPhone have taken a photo.
[01:41:28.120 --> 01:41:33.800]   So Baratov was worked with Russia.
[01:41:33.800 --> 01:41:35.160]   His name is Russian, but he's not.
[01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:36.160]   He's Canadian.
[01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:40.680]   He was born in Russia, but he, he was charged with using data passed to him by Russia's
[01:41:40.680 --> 01:41:46.240]   federal security service to hack email accounts of journalists, business leaders and others.
[01:41:46.240 --> 01:41:52.520]   It turns out Baratov was running a international hacker for hire business.
[01:41:52.520 --> 01:42:00.200]   Uh, he would, he put out a shingle, well, a website in this case in which a website
[01:42:00.200 --> 01:42:06.920]   named web hacker and he advertised in Russian and advertised for the hacking of email accounts
[01:42:06.920 --> 01:42:10.040]   without prepayment, which is, I think, good marketing.
[01:42:10.040 --> 01:42:12.600]   Um, oh, this is a file photo.
[01:42:12.600 --> 01:42:13.600]   Where did he come from?
[01:42:13.600 --> 01:42:14.600]   The only internet today.
[01:42:14.600 --> 01:42:15.600]   And that's his parents.
[01:42:15.600 --> 01:42:16.600]   Yeah.
[01:42:16.600 --> 01:42:17.600]   Okay.
[01:42:17.600 --> 01:42:18.600]   That's a file.
[01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:19.600]   And that's his lawyer.
[01:42:19.600 --> 01:42:20.600]   Okay.
[01:42:20.600 --> 01:42:21.600]   And Hamilton.
[01:42:21.600 --> 01:42:22.440]   Okay.
[01:42:22.440 --> 01:42:25.240]   So, from a year ago though, so that's, that's as they get.
[01:42:25.240 --> 01:42:26.240]   All right.
[01:42:26.240 --> 01:42:30.200]   To go business though, he collected 1.1 million in his fees, which he was used to buy a house
[01:42:30.200 --> 01:42:31.200]   and expensive cars.
[01:42:31.200 --> 01:42:32.200]   Fancy cars.
[01:42:32.200 --> 01:42:33.440]   He was driving a house.
[01:42:33.440 --> 01:42:34.440]   Hmm.
[01:42:34.440 --> 01:42:38.640]   Um, but the thing is he was a dupe basically of the Russian security service.
[01:42:38.640 --> 01:42:39.640]   He wasn't a dupe.
[01:42:39.640 --> 01:42:40.640]   He was getting paid.
[01:42:40.640 --> 01:42:41.640]   He was getting paid.
[01:42:41.640 --> 01:42:42.640]   What can he do?
[01:42:42.640 --> 01:42:45.080]   You know, but he didn't know what he was doing.
[01:42:45.080 --> 01:42:46.080]   Where can we find?
[01:42:46.080 --> 01:42:49.520]   We need, we need a young Canadian to hack email addresses.
[01:42:49.520 --> 01:42:53.840]   He's going to be like some Silicon Valley CEO and he's going to go like, you're giving
[01:42:53.840 --> 01:42:57.720]   me money because I am the smartest security actor on the planet.
[01:42:57.720 --> 01:43:01.560]   That's why you're obviously I'm successful because I'm the best.
[01:43:01.560 --> 01:43:02.760]   You know, pretty good.
[01:43:02.760 --> 01:43:06.440]   So he orchestrated the, the one of the Yahoo breaches.
[01:43:06.440 --> 01:43:07.760]   I didn't realize there were multiple ones.
[01:43:07.760 --> 01:43:12.320]   The, overall Yahoo loss was 3 billion accounts.
[01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:13.320]   Right.
[01:43:13.320 --> 01:43:15.600]   He's only responsible for the first half billion.
[01:43:15.600 --> 01:43:16.600]   Oh.
[01:43:16.600 --> 01:43:24.520]   In 2014, uh, he, uh, was named, uh, in the indictment that charged two Russian spies
[01:43:24.520 --> 01:43:30.220]   with orchestrating the Yahoo breach and apparently Baratov used that stolen data to hack then
[01:43:30.220 --> 01:43:32.560]   journalists, business leaders and others.
[01:43:32.560 --> 01:43:34.760]   So a Russian influence.
[01:43:34.760 --> 01:43:41.240]   So actually I guess what that means is that Yahoo breach was all about the Russian security
[01:43:41.240 --> 01:43:46.800]   services getting the credentials for a few people that they wanted to target and the
[01:43:46.800 --> 01:43:49.400]   rest of us, we were just collateral damage.
[01:43:49.400 --> 01:43:50.400]   Yep.
[01:43:50.400 --> 01:43:51.400]   Wow.
[01:43:51.400 --> 01:43:52.400]   That sounds about right.
[01:43:52.400 --> 01:43:57.080]   But he apologized and promised to be a better man and obey the law on his release.
[01:43:57.080 --> 01:43:59.920]   In five years, he's going to Silicon Valley baby.
[01:43:59.920 --> 01:44:01.560]   He's got a job waiting for him.
[01:44:01.560 --> 01:44:05.200]   He's going to be because, and they're going to love him because he's been a, you know,
[01:44:05.200 --> 01:44:07.720]   been a successful CCO but failed.
[01:44:07.720 --> 01:44:08.720]   Yeah.
[01:44:08.720 --> 01:44:09.720]   Remember failures in Valley.
[01:44:09.720 --> 01:44:11.880]   Nothing wrong with him here.
[01:44:11.880 --> 01:44:15.000]   He can't, you can't have somebody in charge of a startup if you haven't failed at least
[01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:16.000]   twice.
[01:44:16.000 --> 01:44:17.000]   Okay.
[01:44:17.000 --> 01:44:18.000]   I qualify.
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:21.640]   That need the only qualification I have.
[01:44:21.640 --> 01:44:23.640]   Pretty much my life story.
[01:44:23.640 --> 01:44:24.640]   Yeah.
[01:44:24.640 --> 01:44:26.920]   Uh, let's see.
[01:44:26.920 --> 01:44:27.920]   Uh, what else?
[01:44:27.920 --> 01:44:28.920]   What else?
[01:44:28.920 --> 01:44:33.400]   Um, uh, micros, this was, I don't know if this has any merit or value, but it's kind
[01:44:33.400 --> 01:44:41.600]   of an interesting factoid Microsoft surpassed Alphabet's market cap this week.
[01:44:41.600 --> 01:44:49.680]   Uh, there, there is a race going on to become the first company to reach a trillion dollars
[01:44:49.680 --> 01:44:50.680]   in market cap.
[01:44:50.680 --> 01:44:51.680]   Apple's pretty close.
[01:44:51.680 --> 01:44:58.800]   I think they're close to 900 million, uh, alphabets in there, uh, two Googles in there.
[01:44:58.800 --> 01:45:02.760]   Did they say where Microsoft is getting the bulk of that money?
[01:45:02.760 --> 01:45:06.240]   Because I mean, it's, it's different than it was back in the old days when it was all
[01:45:06.240 --> 01:45:08.040]   about package software.
[01:45:08.040 --> 01:45:09.040]   Yeah.
[01:45:09.040 --> 01:45:11.040]   So much of that is cloud based today.
[01:45:11.040 --> 01:45:14.000]   But I don't know if they broke it down.
[01:45:14.000 --> 01:45:16.360]   Uh, I don't know.
[01:45:16.360 --> 01:45:17.840]   Mostly it's future value.
[01:45:17.840 --> 01:45:19.240]   It's not past value.
[01:45:19.240 --> 01:45:23.400]   Uh, what the market is very pleased to see is the cloud business.
[01:45:23.400 --> 01:45:24.400]   The Azure business.
[01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:25.400]   Yes.
[01:45:25.400 --> 01:45:27.560]   Uh, is really accelerating away.
[01:45:27.560 --> 01:45:29.240]   Uh, Microsoft is now.
[01:45:29.240 --> 01:45:32.720]   If you're excited about Microsoft's cloud business, why would you value the market?
[01:45:32.720 --> 01:45:34.720]   Higher than alphabet?
[01:45:34.720 --> 01:45:40.440]   Uh, because Azure's got a much, you, well, because Microsoft's Azure business is going
[01:45:40.440 --> 01:45:41.920]   to be worth a lot more money.
[01:45:41.920 --> 01:45:45.200]   So Google's working in the consumer market, putting ads in front of eyeballs.
[01:45:45.200 --> 01:45:46.200]   Right.
[01:45:46.200 --> 01:45:47.800]   But then market has reached its maximum size.
[01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:50.240]   There's not more eyeballs to reach.
[01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:55.360]   Whereas Microsoft through Azure and like have, as we've seen with Amazon's AWS, they're
[01:45:55.360 --> 01:45:58.560]   just starting to get open up the market in cloud computing.
[01:45:58.560 --> 01:46:03.280]   So the potential for future revenue growth, um, and the ability of, and Microsoft's demonstrating
[01:46:03.280 --> 01:46:07.880]   the ability to transition people away from their legacy infrastructure and suck them into
[01:46:07.880 --> 01:46:13.520]   the Azure and trap them in the cloud so that all the future revenues get, uh, fairly firmly,
[01:46:13.520 --> 01:46:16.160]   uh, forwarded to Microsoft shareholders.
[01:46:16.160 --> 01:46:19.440]   Um, and what we're seeing is that Microsoft's investments.
[01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:25.160]   So Microsoft's now outspending Google on R&D and CapEx in terms of building out its cloud
[01:46:25.160 --> 01:46:27.040]   because it's already got the revenue on the board.
[01:46:27.040 --> 01:46:31.560]   You can, you know, what's interesting is that the prices were pretty much in sync going
[01:46:31.560 --> 01:46:33.880]   up through February of this year.
[01:46:33.880 --> 01:46:36.800]   And then Google actually, let's make it late March.
[01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:40.280]   Google pretty much flattened out while Microsoft continued to go up.
[01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:44.280]   So I don't know what the news was at that point, but, uh, well, I remember when they
[01:46:44.280 --> 01:46:48.920]   had their, their big developers conference, just about a month or two ago, go and the
[01:46:48.920 --> 01:46:52.320]   big news out of that was that Windows was hardly even on the agenda.
[01:46:52.320 --> 01:46:54.880]   I mean, it was, it was, yeah, the market like cloud.
[01:46:54.880 --> 01:46:55.880]   The market liked it.
[01:46:55.880 --> 01:46:56.880]   Yeah.
[01:46:56.880 --> 01:46:58.200]   And then last week it met with people.
[01:46:58.200 --> 01:47:00.480]   And again, it's all cloud.
[01:47:00.480 --> 01:47:05.440]   I mean, it's, it's, it's Azure and other, uh, and to the extent that they are a software
[01:47:05.440 --> 01:47:09.840]   company, it's software by subscription as opposed to actually purchasing your software.
[01:47:09.840 --> 01:47:14.160]   So, you know, like a lot of other people, I write my $100 a year check to Microsoft.
[01:47:14.160 --> 01:47:18.520]   It's kind of painless, but over the long run, that's going to add up to a lot of money with
[01:47:18.520 --> 01:47:19.520]   a lot of me.
[01:47:19.520 --> 01:47:20.520]   Tell me this, Larry.
[01:47:20.520 --> 01:47:21.520]   You don't actually write a check.
[01:47:21.520 --> 01:47:22.520]   I hope.
[01:47:22.520 --> 01:47:23.520]   No, I don't write a check.
[01:47:23.520 --> 01:47:24.520]   I do.
[01:47:24.520 --> 01:47:25.520]   I do.
[01:47:25.520 --> 01:47:26.840]   I do pay for a pay $100 a year.
[01:47:26.840 --> 01:47:28.600]   I'm gonna buy credit card.
[01:47:28.600 --> 01:47:29.600]   I don't even know.
[01:47:29.600 --> 01:47:30.600]   I don't even know.
[01:47:30.600 --> 01:47:31.600]   I know.
[01:47:31.600 --> 01:47:32.600]   I know.
[01:47:32.600 --> 01:47:33.600]   I last read a check.
[01:47:33.600 --> 01:47:34.600]   Is that, is that funny?
[01:47:34.600 --> 01:47:37.480]   I mean, we used to write checks all the time and nobody writes checks anymore.
[01:47:37.480 --> 01:47:38.480]   My wife had the checkbook.
[01:47:38.480 --> 01:47:40.440]   I, I almost never use it.
[01:47:40.440 --> 01:47:41.440]   Yeah.
[01:47:41.440 --> 01:47:42.440]   Yeah.
[01:47:42.440 --> 01:47:46.200]   You know, in, in a couple of generations, we'll still be saying writing checks and the
[01:47:46.200 --> 01:47:48.240]   kids will go, what's, what's a check?
[01:47:48.240 --> 01:47:49.960]   Well, people talk about filming, you know, right?
[01:47:49.960 --> 01:47:50.960]   I film this movie.
[01:47:50.960 --> 01:47:53.800]   When's the last time you dialed a phone?
[01:47:53.800 --> 01:47:54.800]   Exactly.
[01:47:54.800 --> 01:47:55.800]   Right.
[01:47:55.800 --> 01:47:56.800]   Yeah.
[01:47:56.800 --> 01:48:01.760]   No, I, I believe most of what it is is that Microsoft is in their cloud.
[01:48:01.760 --> 01:48:02.840]   They're showing good growth.
[01:48:02.840 --> 01:48:03.840]   They're investing heavily.
[01:48:03.840 --> 01:48:08.880]   So they're spending 12% of their revenue as capex to grow it out.
[01:48:08.880 --> 01:48:11.840]   And they are very strong globally.
[01:48:11.840 --> 01:48:14.120]   So where AWS is particularly strong in the US.
[01:48:14.120 --> 01:48:16.040]   It's a very US centric business.
[01:48:16.040 --> 01:48:17.040]   Isn't it?
[01:48:17.040 --> 01:48:18.040]   Yeah.
[01:48:18.040 --> 01:48:19.040]   They're growing and they're growing very fast.
[01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:20.040]   They're spending heavily.
[01:48:20.040 --> 01:48:23.680]   So, you know, I don't want to underestimate what they're doing.
[01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:29.040]   Microsoft has very strong business in Asia and Africa and Europe.
[01:48:29.040 --> 01:48:31.800]   They have more data centers up and running now.
[01:48:31.800 --> 01:48:33.600]   They're not as big as AWS.
[01:48:33.600 --> 01:48:40.560]   AWS has tended to build less numbers of data centers but make them phenomenally larger.
[01:48:40.560 --> 01:48:42.400]   And of course, they're running into power problems.
[01:48:42.400 --> 01:48:45.200]   So they're not able to get enough power to keep that model going.
[01:48:45.200 --> 01:48:49.200]   So Microsoft's decision to have smaller and more data centers is generally worked out.
[01:48:49.200 --> 01:48:50.200]   That's interesting.
[01:48:50.200 --> 01:48:51.200]   Better.
[01:48:51.200 --> 01:48:52.200]   Yeah.
[01:48:52.200 --> 01:48:55.800]   Everybody's struggling to get power because when you want to get like, you know, 10 megawatts,
[01:48:55.800 --> 01:49:00.960]   50 megawatts, 100 megawatts, and you want to put like 250,000 computers in four data
[01:49:00.960 --> 01:49:05.120]   halls, you know, you trying to sign a 20 year agreement to get power.
[01:49:05.120 --> 01:49:07.840]   That's the whole output of a power station.
[01:49:07.840 --> 01:49:09.600]   Or a Bitcoin miner.
[01:49:09.600 --> 01:49:10.600]   Yeah.
[01:49:10.600 --> 01:49:11.600]   Yeah.
[01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:12.600]   That's right.
[01:49:12.600 --> 01:49:13.600]   Wow.
[01:49:13.600 --> 01:49:14.800]   I think the Bitcoin mining thing is just one of those industries.
[01:49:14.800 --> 01:49:18.520]   It's a flash in a pan until we see the next generation of assets.
[01:49:18.520 --> 01:49:23.040]   There'll be some re spins, we'll see an FPGA or an ASIC or a dedicated today.
[01:49:23.040 --> 01:49:26.880]   We're using general purpose GPUs to do crypto mining.
[01:49:26.880 --> 01:49:30.800]   It would make more sense to have custom assets for those and it'll be a few more years before
[01:49:30.800 --> 01:49:31.880]   they come around.
[01:49:31.880 --> 01:49:34.560]   And then we'll see the power curve drop right off.
[01:49:34.560 --> 01:49:39.320]   Although apparently Bitcoin mining uses as much power now as Ireland.
[01:49:39.320 --> 01:49:40.320]   Yeah.
[01:49:40.320 --> 01:49:41.320]   Yeah.
[01:49:41.320 --> 01:49:45.720]   But I do feel that eventually the, you know, there'll be the companies out there designing
[01:49:45.720 --> 01:49:50.680]   assets. Remember Apple bought PA semi to do the arm chip and then to design it took
[01:49:50.680 --> 01:49:52.320]   five years for that to come along.
[01:49:52.320 --> 01:49:53.320]   Bitcoin's really.
[01:49:53.320 --> 01:49:56.280]   You think they'll be custom asics just for Bitcoin?
[01:49:56.280 --> 01:49:57.280]   Yeah.
[01:49:57.280 --> 01:49:59.840]   Well, there's already a lot of crypto assets out there today.
[01:49:59.840 --> 01:50:05.040]   Could you, is there such a thing as a generic blockchain ASIC?
[01:50:05.040 --> 01:50:09.160]   I think there will be in the same way that we're seeing Google do tensor, the TPU tensor
[01:50:09.160 --> 01:50:10.560]   processing, you know, for AI.
[01:50:10.560 --> 01:50:14.240]   The computations involved in all cryptocurrency roughly the same.
[01:50:14.240 --> 01:50:15.560]   What is it prime number factoring?
[01:50:15.560 --> 01:50:16.560]   Is that what they're doing?
[01:50:16.560 --> 01:50:17.560]   Yeah.
[01:50:17.560 --> 01:50:18.560]   It's all crypto.
[01:50:18.560 --> 01:50:21.800]   So there's plenty of crypto chips out there, but I'm not a, I'm not a blockchain expert,
[01:50:21.800 --> 01:50:27.200]   but it does make sense that when there's a market big enough and when it becomes, when
[01:50:27.200 --> 01:50:31.200]   it becomes static, like at the moment, there's too much iteration around the crypto algorithms
[01:50:31.200 --> 01:50:32.200]   and the software.
[01:50:32.200 --> 01:50:37.240]   But at some point that that market will reach a, you know, a plateau and that'll be the point
[01:50:37.240 --> 01:50:40.600]   when we see custom assets just for Bitcoin mining come out.
[01:50:40.600 --> 01:50:45.560]   I would imagine that there are companies out there designing them, you know, Cavium, Broadcom,
[01:50:45.560 --> 01:50:47.960]   the usual criminals.
[01:50:47.960 --> 01:50:53.160]   I'm just looking if I can find a cryptocurrency ASIC.
[01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:58.200]   I mean, there are specific ASIC miners designed for cryptocurrency, but they're not probably
[01:50:58.200 --> 01:51:00.400]   tuned to blockchain particularly.
[01:51:00.400 --> 01:51:01.400]   Yeah.
[01:51:01.400 --> 01:51:05.840]   Well, the GPU does the functionality quite well, but you know, Cavium, for example, has
[01:51:05.840 --> 01:51:10.280]   been producing a crypto chip that we've been using in network appliances for the last
[01:51:10.280 --> 01:51:11.840]   15 years.
[01:51:11.840 --> 01:51:17.320]   And that has just been used for the TLS and the HTTPS and the YPSEC and that chip has
[01:51:17.320 --> 01:51:18.840]   been widely used.
[01:51:18.840 --> 01:51:23.880]   That must not be easily adapted for use in these or maybe it's not fast enough or, but
[01:51:23.880 --> 01:51:24.880]   they've been using GPUs.
[01:51:24.880 --> 01:51:27.480]   Now, GPU is a general purpose graphics processor.
[01:51:27.480 --> 01:51:29.840]   It's like what Intel is on the x86.
[01:51:29.840 --> 01:51:33.640]   It's a general purpose piece of silicon.
[01:51:33.640 --> 01:51:37.760]   But at some point when the market gets big enough, it makes sense to make a custom ASIC
[01:51:37.760 --> 01:51:39.080]   that does just the things it does.
[01:51:39.080 --> 01:51:40.440]   It's actually though not necessary.
[01:51:40.440 --> 01:51:46.560]   That may be not a benign influence on the problem of Bitcoin mining because it just continues
[01:51:46.560 --> 01:51:50.720]   to concentrate the mining into a small group of people, right?
[01:51:50.720 --> 01:51:52.520]   Because these are very expensive.
[01:51:52.520 --> 01:51:56.200]   Presumably you're going to be very expensive chips.
[01:51:56.200 --> 01:51:59.480]   Well, you know, this is what I mean.
[01:51:59.480 --> 01:52:00.480]   There has to be a plateau.
[01:52:00.480 --> 01:52:01.840]   There has to be enough demand.
[01:52:01.840 --> 01:52:03.680]   There has to be enough people who want them.
[01:52:03.680 --> 01:52:06.480]   You know, that sort of stuff and that plateau hasn't been reached.
[01:52:06.480 --> 01:52:11.400]   And it's not actually yet actually guaranteed that cryptocurrencies or crypto, you know,
[01:52:11.400 --> 01:52:13.760]   the blockchain is actually going to be a thing.
[01:52:13.760 --> 01:52:14.760]   What?
[01:52:14.760 --> 01:52:15.760]   Right.
[01:52:15.760 --> 01:52:16.760]   Right.
[01:52:16.760 --> 01:52:17.760]   It's not a thing.
[01:52:17.760 --> 01:52:18.760]   I thought it was a thing.
[01:52:18.760 --> 01:52:19.760]   Not a thing for me.
[01:52:19.760 --> 01:52:22.040]   I mean, there's a lot of momentum.
[01:52:22.040 --> 01:52:24.600]   I mean, we've seen these sorts of fads come and go.
[01:52:24.600 --> 01:52:25.600]   Yeah.
[01:52:25.600 --> 01:52:29.440]   And there's no question that Bitcoin, you know, is right on the edge of the chasm, you
[01:52:29.440 --> 01:52:31.880]   know, crossing the chasm sort of a thing.
[01:52:31.880 --> 01:52:35.560]   But until the governments come around and start to say these are currencies and they
[01:52:35.560 --> 01:52:36.560]   have to be regulated.
[01:52:36.560 --> 01:52:39.000]   And that's the next step.
[01:52:39.000 --> 01:52:44.320]   And until we see that sort of acceptance by, you know, the incumbent financial institutions
[01:52:44.320 --> 01:52:47.800]   that this is a viable form of value exchange, we're not going to.
[01:52:47.800 --> 01:52:50.680]   I don't see how these cryptocurrencies will survive.
[01:52:50.680 --> 01:52:52.840]   Certainly there'll be a massive shake out.
[01:52:52.840 --> 01:52:54.640]   Only a few of these crypto coins.
[01:52:54.640 --> 01:52:57.560]   If they become legitimate, what's the point?
[01:52:57.560 --> 01:52:59.560]   Well, that's the question.
[01:52:59.560 --> 01:53:05.280]   Like ultimately, even the Bitcoin network today runs so slow and is so expensive that
[01:53:05.280 --> 01:53:07.480]   it's not a threat to visa.
[01:53:07.480 --> 01:53:11.560]   Visa can process a transaction for three cents per transaction and charges.
[01:53:11.560 --> 01:53:13.520]   Third, basically, I think it's like 15 cents.
[01:53:13.520 --> 01:53:15.520]   And so it actually makes out pretty well.
[01:53:15.520 --> 01:53:21.120]   But a Bitcoin transaction costs about $15 in electricity to run through and takes roughly
[01:53:21.120 --> 01:53:23.640]   four days, three days, I think.
[01:53:23.640 --> 01:53:28.040]   Last time I checked off stop bothering because I'm just tired of getting blockchain pitches.
[01:53:28.040 --> 01:53:31.920]   But and so the problem with the blockchain is if you have a transaction today and you
[01:53:31.920 --> 01:53:35.240]   exchange coins, you need to wait three days before the
[01:53:35.240 --> 01:53:37.600]   network's complete before the transaction completes.
[01:53:37.600 --> 01:53:38.600]   And it's so volatile.
[01:53:38.600 --> 01:53:40.600]   You don't know what you paid.
[01:53:40.600 --> 01:53:41.600]   Three days.
[01:53:41.600 --> 01:53:45.160]   If you have to wait three days, why don't you just mail a check?
[01:53:45.160 --> 01:53:48.240]   Oh, the check will come in back.
[01:53:48.240 --> 01:53:49.920]   You know, it may very well book.
[01:53:49.920 --> 01:53:51.760]   Sure, the coming back vinyl is coming back.
[01:53:51.760 --> 01:53:54.240]   I think I'm going to invest in a check printing company.
[01:53:54.240 --> 01:53:58.720]   I think all the hipster kids will be writing checks with quill pens.
[01:53:58.720 --> 01:53:59.720]   Exactly.
[01:53:59.720 --> 01:54:00.720]   It'll be so exciting.
[01:54:00.720 --> 01:54:02.520]   We're going to take a little break.
[01:54:02.520 --> 01:54:06.640]   Yep, get to the last the bottom of the at the end of the show.
[01:54:06.640 --> 01:54:09.680]   All the all the good stuff sinks to the bottom.
[01:54:09.680 --> 01:54:11.400]   Or maybe it's just the seeds and the stems.
[01:54:11.400 --> 01:54:13.400]   We're going to get to that in just a second.
[01:54:13.400 --> 01:54:15.080]   But first a word from Mughsoft.
[01:54:15.080 --> 01:54:17.160]   You probably know about Mughsoft.
[01:54:17.160 --> 01:54:18.400]   Greg Farrell.
[01:54:18.400 --> 01:54:19.840]   It is a little bit about this.
[01:54:19.840 --> 01:54:20.840]   Yes, indeed.
[01:54:20.840 --> 01:54:24.520]   Algorithmic IT ops.
[01:54:24.520 --> 01:54:27.240]   That's the AI in Mughsoft AI.
[01:54:27.240 --> 01:54:32.760]   It is a brilliant solution for people who are on pager duty.
[01:54:32.760 --> 01:54:35.120]   You're the one who gets the incident reports.
[01:54:35.120 --> 01:54:37.600]   You're the one who gets all the notifications.
[01:54:37.600 --> 01:54:40.680]   And it's kind of like a pachinko machine in your head.
[01:54:40.680 --> 01:54:42.120]   It's just bing, bing, bing, bing, bing.
[01:54:42.120 --> 01:54:45.520]   And at some point when all those alerts and tickets are lighting up your monitor like
[01:54:45.520 --> 01:54:48.280]   a Christmas tree, you're just not, you're so stressed out.
[01:54:48.280 --> 01:54:49.960]   You're not being productive.
[01:54:49.960 --> 01:54:54.960]   Nobody can analyze those alerts and respond intelligently to all those tickets.
[01:54:54.960 --> 01:54:57.600]   But that's where Mughsoft AI ops comes in.
[01:54:57.600 --> 01:55:02.840]   It reduces the IT alerts and tickets by up to 99%, not by turning them off, but by consolidating
[01:55:02.840 --> 01:55:05.960]   them, correlating events into actual work items.
[01:55:05.960 --> 01:55:07.520]   They call them situations.
[01:55:07.520 --> 01:55:10.200]   So you can say, I need to handle this.
[01:55:10.200 --> 01:55:12.040]   You handle the stuff that matters.
[01:55:12.040 --> 01:55:13.040]   It's brilliant.
[01:55:13.040 --> 01:55:14.200]   It works with all your IT tools.
[01:55:14.200 --> 01:55:18.440]   So all of those, all of those pingers can all be at work.
[01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:23.280]   But Mughsoft's AI ops platform correlates them and makes it easy for you to respond to.
[01:55:23.280 --> 01:55:28.200]   Here's a customer testimonial actually from a company called HCL Technologies.
[01:55:28.200 --> 01:55:31.000]   They are a global IT managed service provider.
[01:55:31.000 --> 01:55:34.800]   That means they live in the Pachinko parlor.
[01:55:34.800 --> 01:55:42.480]   They got multiple clients, multiple alerts coming from every possible bit of telemetry.
[01:55:42.480 --> 01:55:46.800]   They actually created something called the Dry Ice platform and they use Mughsoft AI
[01:55:46.800 --> 01:55:49.080]   ops as their event management layer.
[01:55:49.080 --> 01:55:50.080]   People love Dry Ice.
[01:55:50.080 --> 01:55:51.280]   It's award-winning.
[01:55:51.280 --> 01:55:56.480]   And it's helped their clients streamline operational workflows, reduce time in the detect to correct
[01:55:56.480 --> 01:55:59.000]   life cycle of incident tickets.
[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:04.280]   Actually by a lot, 33% reduction in the mean time to restore.
[01:56:04.280 --> 01:56:08.320]   Just because of that means they can support more customers with service quality, keeping
[01:56:08.320 --> 01:56:10.200]   operational costs low, efficiency high.
[01:56:10.200 --> 01:56:12.560]   It's been really great for HCL Technologies.
[01:56:12.560 --> 01:56:14.440]   It could be great for you too.
[01:56:14.440 --> 01:56:19.080]   With Mughsoft AI ops, you can reduce your IT alerts and tickets by up to 99% right now,
[01:56:19.080 --> 01:56:20.720]   wouldn't that be nice?
[01:56:20.720 --> 01:56:23.520]   It's at Mughsoft.com to get a demo.
[01:56:23.520 --> 01:56:24.880]   Mughsoft, you see the logo?
[01:56:24.880 --> 01:56:25.960]   It's got a cow.
[01:56:25.960 --> 01:56:26.960]   That's the Mugh.
[01:56:26.960 --> 01:56:29.400]   I don't know what the G is and then they're soft.
[01:56:29.400 --> 01:56:32.640]   Actually, I got the story from the founder.
[01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:33.640]   He's a big cow fan.
[01:56:33.640 --> 01:56:34.640]   He wanted to call it Mughsoft.
[01:56:34.640 --> 01:56:36.080]   He couldn't get the domain.
[01:56:36.080 --> 01:56:38.080]   He's also a fan of the Mughs synthesizer.
[01:56:38.080 --> 01:56:41.200]   So he said, "Oh, we just had a G. We'll call it Mughsoft."
[01:56:41.200 --> 01:56:42.880]   Well, that's Mughsoft.com.
[01:56:42.880 --> 01:56:46.480]   M-O-O-G-S-O-F-T dot com.
[01:56:46.480 --> 01:56:47.480]   And get a demo.
[01:56:47.480 --> 01:56:49.880]   We thank Mughsoft so much for their support of this week in tech.
[01:56:49.880 --> 01:56:56.400]   Actually, I've been meaning to ask you since we've got you on Seth.
[01:56:56.400 --> 01:57:02.600]   I have to say, in the time since the last Tesla accident, there have been probably 30,000
[01:57:02.600 --> 01:57:07.800]   accidents with thousands of deaths with normal gas vehicles.
[01:57:07.800 --> 01:57:11.280]   But because these are self-driving cars or autopilot or whatever, you're getting a lot
[01:57:11.280 --> 01:57:12.280]   of attention.
[01:57:12.280 --> 01:57:15.400]   Seems like there's been a lot of accidents lately.
[01:57:15.400 --> 01:57:21.640]   Uber decided to stop working on this self-driving technology entirely, I think.
[01:57:21.640 --> 01:57:23.440]   Is that right?
[01:57:23.440 --> 01:57:25.160]   What's going on?
[01:57:25.160 --> 01:57:29.800]   I think you're just going to, like with any new technology, you're going to see a lot
[01:57:29.800 --> 01:57:33.960]   of fits and starts, stops and starts.
[01:57:33.960 --> 01:57:39.640]   We get, so I think we're one of the bigger EV sites and autonomous sites.
[01:57:39.640 --> 01:57:47.320]   So we get probably one or two tips a day from some small local paper that a Tesla was in
[01:57:47.320 --> 01:57:48.320]   an accident.
[01:57:48.320 --> 01:57:49.320]   Right.
[01:57:49.320 --> 01:57:50.320]   And there's really--
[01:57:50.320 --> 01:57:52.080]   Yeah, there's no news there.
[01:57:52.080 --> 01:57:53.080]   Yeah.
[01:57:53.080 --> 01:57:54.080]   Right.
[01:57:54.080 --> 01:57:58.920]   So when it's driving autonomously, and a lot of people say they're driving an autopilot
[01:57:58.920 --> 01:58:00.120]   and aren't.
[01:58:00.120 --> 01:58:03.640]   So sometimes you have to wait for Tesla to verify.
[01:58:03.640 --> 01:58:08.040]   Then it becomes kind of news if somebody's been driving an autopilot and they hit that
[01:58:08.040 --> 01:58:15.160]   center divider thing and dies, sadly.
[01:58:15.160 --> 01:58:18.920]   That becomes a story, I guess.
[01:58:18.920 --> 01:58:23.840]   But I kind of feel like this is how it's going to happen.
[01:58:23.840 --> 01:58:27.360]   These things aren't just going to automatically one day be perfect.
[01:58:27.360 --> 01:58:30.160]   And I think that's kind of the narrative that's happening in the media right now.
[01:58:30.160 --> 01:58:37.720]   It's like a few people are saying that people are going to die, this is not happy.
[01:58:37.720 --> 01:58:41.120]   But people are going to die as this technology matures.
[01:58:41.120 --> 01:58:51.880]   But I think the long term end result is going to be that more people will live because a
[01:58:51.880 --> 01:58:54.440]   lot of these accidents will be avoided.
[01:58:54.440 --> 01:59:01.240]   But I think the takeaway right now is that don't take your eyes off the road in any part.
[01:59:01.240 --> 01:59:02.240]   Yes.
[01:59:02.240 --> 01:59:05.400]   You mentioned the Cadillac CT6.
[01:59:05.400 --> 01:59:06.480]   I drove that.
[01:59:06.480 --> 01:59:08.240]   I drove that also.
[01:59:08.240 --> 01:59:11.800]   That's actually a really much smarter, I think, than Tesla's.
[01:59:11.800 --> 01:59:14.800]   It has a camera that's looking at your eyes.
[01:59:14.800 --> 01:59:19.200]   And if you look away, it says, wait a minute, you know, for five seconds, it vibrates the
[01:59:19.200 --> 01:59:20.200]   seat vigorously.
[01:59:20.200 --> 01:59:21.200]   It's violent.
[01:59:21.200 --> 01:59:25.680]   I don't know if you tried it because it was very hard for me to look away for the road
[01:59:25.680 --> 01:59:27.320]   for any length of time.
[01:59:27.320 --> 01:59:31.760]   I finally put my hands over my eyes and peaked and it thought I wasn't looking because I
[01:59:31.760 --> 01:59:32.760]   couldn't.
[01:59:32.760 --> 01:59:34.080]   I'm we're driving that highway speeds.
[01:59:34.080 --> 01:59:35.160]   I can't.
[01:59:35.160 --> 01:59:36.440]   And I don't trust these things.
[01:59:36.440 --> 01:59:38.640]   But I think GM actually has done it pretty well.
[01:59:38.640 --> 01:59:40.640]   I think that Cadillac system is good.
[01:59:40.640 --> 01:59:41.640]   Yeah.
[01:59:41.640 --> 01:59:45.760]   They had a Toyota research spoke at CES at a couple other places.
[01:59:45.760 --> 01:59:47.200]   And he talks about a couple of things.
[01:59:47.200 --> 01:59:48.200]   One is this lulling.
[01:59:48.200 --> 01:59:51.320]   You know, you get this sense of false confidence.
[01:59:51.320 --> 01:59:56.840]   But he also talked about how we have a much higher expectation of autonomous vehicles that
[01:59:56.840 --> 01:59:59.080]   we do for human driven vehicles.
[01:59:59.080 --> 02:00:04.760]   So we have learned to tolerate thousands of deaths per year or maybe millions.
[02:00:04.760 --> 02:00:06.920]   40,000 deaths in the US yearly.
[02:00:06.920 --> 02:00:07.920]   In the US alone.
[02:00:07.920 --> 02:00:08.920]   In the US alone.
[02:00:08.920 --> 02:00:10.480]   More than a million globally.
[02:00:10.480 --> 02:00:11.480]   Right.
[02:00:11.480 --> 02:00:12.480]   A million.
[02:00:12.480 --> 02:00:14.320]   And now that's unacceptable.
[02:00:14.320 --> 02:00:17.040]   I'm sorry by any standards, that's unacceptable.
[02:00:17.040 --> 02:00:20.640]   But we have two or three horrible situations with Tesla.
[02:00:20.640 --> 02:00:22.640]   And suddenly that becomes a major crisis.
[02:00:22.640 --> 02:00:26.560]   So I agree with it with the assess that at the end of the day, I think these cars are
[02:00:26.560 --> 02:00:31.600]   going to fave a lot more live, even though there's going to be some tragic situations.
[02:00:31.600 --> 02:00:33.440]   But I think it'll be relatively few.
[02:00:33.440 --> 02:00:34.440]   Yeah.
[02:00:34.440 --> 02:00:35.440]   Yeah.
[02:00:35.440 --> 02:00:41.040]   I mean, I think the interesting thing about this is how few deaths there have been to
[02:00:41.040 --> 02:00:43.040]   this point.
[02:00:43.040 --> 02:00:47.320]   And that all of a sudden when you start to have them, that is actually a surprise and
[02:00:47.320 --> 02:00:48.800]   is becomes news.
[02:00:48.800 --> 02:00:51.200]   They've actually almost done too good a job.
[02:00:51.200 --> 02:00:54.360]   We sort of expected there to be problems when there wasn't in the early days.
[02:00:54.360 --> 02:00:58.200]   There's always going to be nitwits who turn on the autopilot in their Tesla, then get
[02:00:58.200 --> 02:01:00.960]   in the passenger seat or take a nap.
[02:01:00.960 --> 02:01:02.360]   You won't allow that, will it?
[02:01:02.360 --> 02:01:03.360]   Will it allow that?
[02:01:03.360 --> 02:01:04.360]   Yeah.
[02:01:04.360 --> 02:01:05.360]   Then it require you to.
[02:01:05.360 --> 02:01:06.360]   No.
[02:01:06.360 --> 02:01:11.120]   You can confirm this, but my experience has been it gives you a few minutes before it
[02:01:11.120 --> 02:01:13.880]   even notifies you that your hands aren't in the wheel.
[02:01:13.880 --> 02:01:16.760]   You have to actually move the wheel for it to know your hands are there.
[02:01:16.760 --> 02:01:20.960]   That was the nice thing about the Cadillac had a capacitance system and knew if your
[02:01:20.960 --> 02:01:21.960]   hands were there or not.
[02:01:21.960 --> 02:01:22.960]   You didn't have to jerk.
[02:01:22.960 --> 02:01:28.280]   You know, without the CT6, you don't actually have to have the hands on the wheel.
[02:01:28.280 --> 02:01:29.280]   Your hands don't have to be on.
[02:01:29.280 --> 02:01:30.280]   Yeah.
[02:01:30.280 --> 02:01:31.280]   Your eyes have to be.
[02:01:31.280 --> 02:01:32.280]   Yeah.
[02:01:32.280 --> 02:01:34.880]   And the other thing is like they have that green light across the top of the steering
[02:01:34.880 --> 02:01:39.160]   wheel, which is like, it kind of keeps you focused on the task.
[02:01:39.160 --> 02:01:41.320]   It goes green when you're in autopilot.
[02:01:41.320 --> 02:01:44.720]   It doesn't do lane changing like the Tesla does, which is probably a good thing.
[02:01:44.720 --> 02:01:46.440]   It always makes me really nervous.
[02:01:46.440 --> 02:01:50.320]   But it does the lane keeping and it does the adaptive cruise control.
[02:01:50.320 --> 02:01:51.560]   And I thought it did it quite well.
[02:01:51.560 --> 02:01:55.800]   And I liked that green light because you know if it's engaged or not, it's very clear.
[02:01:55.800 --> 02:01:56.800]   Right.
[02:01:56.800 --> 02:02:02.880]   But to go back to like the bigger picture thing, like all of these people who have done like
[02:02:02.880 --> 02:02:08.800]   incredibly stupid things like we so for instance, we got a tip from somebody who had fallen
[02:02:08.800 --> 02:02:20.400]   asleep like out cold and the Tesla drove through a toll booth at highway speeds and it clipped.
[02:02:20.400 --> 02:02:25.200]   This is like a Model S so car clipped one of the curbs in the toll booth.
[02:02:25.200 --> 02:02:26.960]   The guy flipped over like six times.
[02:02:26.960 --> 02:02:27.960]   He walked away.
[02:02:27.960 --> 02:02:28.960]   Oh, geez.
[02:02:28.960 --> 02:02:32.440]   Which is like, you know, a good thing, I guess.
[02:02:32.440 --> 02:02:36.320]   But you know, we never reported the story because we were like, you idiot.
[02:02:36.320 --> 02:02:37.760]   Why did you go to sleep on the freeway?
[02:02:37.760 --> 02:02:40.000]   You could have killed like 10 people.
[02:02:40.000 --> 02:02:43.480]   And you know, clearly we weren't making friends with this possible story.
[02:02:43.480 --> 02:02:48.480]   But you know, at the same time, it's just so frustrating because these people like Tesla's
[02:02:48.480 --> 02:02:52.680]   clearly saying, don't take your, you know, like pay attention.
[02:02:52.680 --> 02:02:55.840]   This is not, you're not, you know, I actually.
[02:02:55.840 --> 02:02:58.440]   I love the autopilot.
[02:02:58.440 --> 02:02:59.440]   Use all the time.
[02:02:59.440 --> 02:03:03.080]   And I wish I'd had it when I commuted because I was at the end of the day when I was coming
[02:03:03.080 --> 02:03:04.680]   home, I was always get sleepy.
[02:03:04.680 --> 02:03:05.680]   Yeah.
[02:03:05.680 --> 02:03:08.120]   And I was always afraid that I would not off.
[02:03:08.120 --> 02:03:13.240]   And while I wouldn't recommend doing it on purpose, at least I knew that if I briefly
[02:03:13.240 --> 02:03:17.480]   nodded off, the car wasn't going to veer off to the side that was going to keep the lane.
[02:03:17.480 --> 02:03:19.960]   And so I think that would have loved to have that.
[02:03:19.960 --> 02:03:20.960]   So I don't have autopilot.
[02:03:20.960 --> 02:03:21.960]   Absolutely.
[02:03:21.960 --> 02:03:25.560]   I do have adaptive cruise control and I just took a road trip from the Bay Area to Seattle.
[02:03:25.560 --> 02:03:29.200]   And it was a much more relaxing trip because I didn't have to worry about starting and
[02:03:29.200 --> 02:03:30.200]   stopping.
[02:03:30.200 --> 02:03:31.200]   I got in traffic.
[02:03:31.200 --> 02:03:36.480]   I took my, you know, my screen and I actually find that I, that it actually helps me be
[02:03:36.480 --> 02:03:40.640]   less tired because I don't have to work as hard driving as I used to do.
[02:03:40.640 --> 02:03:44.560]   And I presume autopilot is even easier in terms of relaxing.
[02:03:44.560 --> 02:03:49.760]   So, Uber did not discontinue, but they've temporarily paused all autonomous.
[02:03:49.760 --> 02:03:50.840]   And they're doing it.
[02:03:50.840 --> 02:03:52.080]   They're going to do it in Pittsburgh.
[02:03:52.080 --> 02:03:54.640]   I believe they're going to restart it in Pittsburgh fairly soon.
[02:03:54.640 --> 02:04:00.360]   What's interesting, California has just announced that it will allow autonomous cars to pick
[02:04:00.360 --> 02:04:01.360]   up passengers.
[02:04:01.360 --> 02:04:08.400]   So this is, you know, the state's, yeah, states are sort of competing for the right to host
[02:04:08.400 --> 02:04:10.960]   this kind of research, which I find interesting.
[02:04:10.960 --> 02:04:16.760]   Right, because Arizona already has Waymo doing autonomous driving, like on, on streets,
[02:04:16.760 --> 02:04:18.200]   public streets today.
[02:04:18.200 --> 02:04:19.200]   Right.
[02:04:19.200 --> 02:04:23.000]   And it will, they'll open up and I think Phoenix later this year.
[02:04:23.000 --> 02:04:26.280]   So, you know, when people say like, I don't know, this autonomous thing, it's going to
[02:04:26.280 --> 02:04:30.920]   be, you know, 10, 20 years from now, it's happening right now on public streets.
[02:04:30.920 --> 02:04:34.520]   And this year, Google will be doing it in a major city or Waymo.
[02:04:34.520 --> 02:04:35.520]   Wow.
[02:04:35.520 --> 02:04:37.720]   And they figured out the pricey model yet with what people are going to pay for those
[02:04:37.720 --> 02:04:38.720]   rides.
[02:04:38.720 --> 02:04:41.760]   There's the rides to be free at least, that's because they're testing.
[02:04:41.760 --> 02:04:42.760]   Yeah.
[02:04:42.760 --> 02:04:44.600]   But at some point, I'm sure, I don't know.
[02:04:44.600 --> 02:04:49.000]   I mean, Uber, the entire Uber business model is based on the idea that they can get drivers
[02:04:49.000 --> 02:04:50.000]   out of the equation.
[02:04:50.000 --> 02:04:52.160]   Otherwise, it doesn't make any sense at all.
[02:04:52.160 --> 02:04:53.160]   Right.
[02:04:53.160 --> 02:04:54.160]   Right.
[02:04:54.160 --> 02:04:57.440]   I mean, is Google just going to show you ads the whole time you're in that car?
[02:04:57.440 --> 02:04:59.600]   Like, how that model is going to work?
[02:04:59.600 --> 02:05:00.600]   Hey, why not?
[02:05:00.600 --> 02:05:01.600]   You're not looking at the road.
[02:05:01.600 --> 02:05:02.600]   You should look at the ads.
[02:05:02.600 --> 02:05:03.600]   Right.
[02:05:03.600 --> 02:05:04.600]   I love this headline.
[02:05:04.600 --> 02:05:08.360]   It's the ultimate link bait headline in the next web.
[02:05:08.360 --> 02:05:13.760]   Self-driving cars will kill people and we need to accept that.
[02:05:13.760 --> 02:05:17.120]   It is the number one most popular article on TNW right now.
[02:05:17.120 --> 02:05:18.120]   So there you go.
[02:05:18.120 --> 02:05:19.120]   It's a good headline.
[02:05:19.120 --> 02:05:20.120]   It's a pretty long page.
[02:05:20.120 --> 02:05:21.120]   It's the ultimate link bait.
[02:05:21.120 --> 02:05:22.120]   It is a link bait.
[02:05:22.120 --> 02:05:23.120]   Yeah.
[02:05:23.120 --> 02:05:24.120]   That's right, though.
[02:05:24.120 --> 02:05:25.120]   It is.
[02:05:25.120 --> 02:05:27.920]   I mean, at the end of the day, people will die from whatever.
[02:05:27.920 --> 02:05:29.960]   People will die from new medicines.
[02:05:29.960 --> 02:05:30.960]   Right.
[02:05:30.960 --> 02:05:33.880]   You know, modern medicine kills people.
[02:05:33.880 --> 02:05:37.120]   It kills a lot less people than if we didn't have it.
[02:05:37.120 --> 02:05:38.480]   People die from wearing seat belts.
[02:05:38.480 --> 02:05:41.880]   It's very rare, but there are rare cases where people die.
[02:05:41.880 --> 02:05:43.280]   But they're a good thing.
[02:05:43.280 --> 02:05:45.920]   Yeah, because most people are protected by them.
[02:05:45.920 --> 02:05:48.240]   But once in a while, something bad happens.
[02:05:48.240 --> 02:05:53.440]   If you want to use Facebook or Twitter in Uganda, you have to pay a nickel.
[02:05:53.440 --> 02:05:56.920]   That's quite a lot of money in Uganda, honestly.
[02:05:56.920 --> 02:05:57.920]   It is.
[02:05:57.920 --> 02:06:01.240]   Actually, per capita income is $666.10.
[02:06:01.240 --> 02:06:04.160]   It's $500.10.
[02:06:04.160 --> 02:06:06.360]   That's a lot of money in Uganda.
[02:06:06.360 --> 02:06:09.360]   That's a lot of money in Canada.
[02:06:09.360 --> 02:06:11.360]   It's a lot of money in Canada.
[02:06:11.360 --> 02:06:13.800]   That's a lot of money in Canada.
[02:06:13.800 --> 02:06:16.800]   It's a lot of money in Canada.
[02:06:16.800 --> 02:06:19.560]   That's a lot of money in Canada.
[02:06:19.560 --> 02:06:22.160]   That's a lot of money in Canada.
[02:06:22.160 --> 02:06:23.720]   That's a lot of money in Canada.
[02:06:23.720 --> 02:06:24.720]   That's a lot of money in Canada.
[02:06:24.720 --> 02:06:26.720]   I mean, it's a lot of money in Canada.
[02:06:26.720 --> 02:06:28.680]   It's a lot of money in Canada.
[02:06:28.680 --> 02:06:33.680]   You're going to gossip.
[02:06:33.680 --> 02:06:38.680]   I don't think it matters if you've got WhatsApp or Facebook.
[02:06:38.680 --> 02:06:40.680]   Gossip happens.
[02:06:40.680 --> 02:06:45.680]   I'll place a pretty substantial bet in here that this is absolutely a perfect way to
[02:06:45.680 --> 02:06:48.680]   graft some pretty good cash.
[02:06:48.680 --> 02:06:52.680]   On one hand, you get rid of people getting social media.
[02:06:52.680 --> 02:06:56.680]   You lose control of external forces influencing the population.
[02:06:56.680 --> 02:06:59.680]   You loot that fund quite nicely.
[02:06:59.680 --> 02:07:00.680]   Then off you go.
[02:07:00.680 --> 02:07:03.680]   Five years in rural perception.
[02:07:03.680 --> 02:07:08.680]   If I had a nickel for every idiot, that's going to be rich.
[02:07:08.680 --> 02:07:10.680]   That's a brilliant idea.
[02:07:10.680 --> 02:07:13.680]   Let's pass a law.
[02:07:13.680 --> 02:07:16.680]   That to me looks like straight up corruption.
[02:07:16.680 --> 02:07:18.680]   That's the sort of tax that you can introduce.
[02:07:18.680 --> 02:07:21.680]   You can put it into a fund that you can do something with.
[02:07:21.680 --> 02:07:25.680]   End up buying a couple of shellays in France, a hotel in central London
[02:07:25.680 --> 02:07:29.680]   and a couple of flats in New York and then Rata.
[02:07:29.680 --> 02:07:33.680]   Mr. Greg Ferro, you're such a cynic, but that's what makes you great.
[02:07:33.680 --> 02:07:36.680]   PacketPushers.net.
[02:07:36.680 --> 02:07:37.680]   Is that right?
[02:07:37.680 --> 02:07:38.680]   Yes, exactly right.
[02:07:38.680 --> 02:07:42.680]   He's on the Twitter at etherealmind.
[02:07:42.680 --> 02:07:44.680]   We love it whenever you can be on.
[02:07:44.680 --> 02:07:45.680]   Thank you for staying up late.
[02:07:45.680 --> 02:07:46.680]   What is it?
[02:07:46.680 --> 02:07:47.680]   Two in the morning there?
[02:07:47.680 --> 02:07:48.680]   Ten past one.
[02:07:48.680 --> 02:07:53.680]   Yes, but it's only possible because you don't get to look this good by staying up to one
[02:07:53.680 --> 02:07:55.680]   and then you're going to be a little bit more
[02:07:55.680 --> 02:07:56.680]   than you are.
[02:07:56.680 --> 02:07:57.680]   Thank you, Greg.
[02:07:57.680 --> 02:07:59.680]   Anything you want to plug before we wrap this up?
[02:07:59.680 --> 02:08:03.680]   No, but if you are into Enterprise IT, you probably love some of our podcasts
[02:08:03.680 --> 02:08:07.680]   and some of our Enterprise IT coverage because we a bunch of blogs
[02:08:07.680 --> 02:08:10.680]   and we've also got a membership system we're about to launch soon,
[02:08:10.680 --> 02:08:12.680]   so stand by it for that.
[02:08:12.680 --> 02:08:13.680]   Yes.
[02:08:13.680 --> 02:08:15.680]   Seth has been really great having you on.
[02:08:15.680 --> 02:08:16.680]   I hope you'll come back.
[02:08:16.680 --> 02:08:20.680]   Seth Winetribe is editor in chief and a founder and publisher of some of the best
[02:08:20.680 --> 02:08:23.680]   online publications including 905Mac, 905Google,
[02:08:23.680 --> 02:08:27.680]   Electric and his newest drone DJ.com.
[02:08:27.680 --> 02:08:30.680]   Anything you want to plug Seth?
[02:08:30.680 --> 02:08:32.680]   You did my plugging for me.
[02:08:32.680 --> 02:08:33.680]   That's my job.
[02:08:33.680 --> 02:08:34.680]   That's my job.
[02:08:34.680 --> 02:08:35.680]   Take it seriously.
[02:08:35.680 --> 02:08:39.680]   He's on the Twitter at ll Seth J.
[02:08:39.680 --> 02:08:44.680]   L.O. Cool J was taken, but L.L. Seth J is still available.
[02:08:44.680 --> 02:08:45.680]   Yes.
[02:08:45.680 --> 02:08:48.680]   I like it.
[02:08:48.680 --> 02:08:50.680]   We also thank you so much for being here.
[02:08:50.680 --> 02:08:52.680]   Mr. Larry Magad.
[02:08:52.680 --> 02:08:53.680]   He is L.L.
[02:08:53.680 --> 02:08:54.680]   Larry Magad.
[02:08:54.680 --> 02:08:55.680]   J.
[02:08:55.680 --> 02:08:56.680]   No, he's not.
[02:08:56.680 --> 02:08:59.680]   He's not Larry Magad on the Twitter CBS News Radio.
[02:08:59.680 --> 02:09:00.680]   You hear him all the time?
[02:09:00.680 --> 02:09:03.680]   I hear you every day on KCBS or local CBS station.
[02:09:03.680 --> 02:09:04.680]   Well, I'm glad somebody does.
[02:09:04.680 --> 02:09:05.680]   That's good.
[02:09:05.680 --> 02:09:08.680]   Connects safely.org is the website.
[02:09:08.680 --> 02:09:10.680]   Anything you'd like to plug?
[02:09:10.680 --> 02:09:13.680]   No, you know, just come by connect safely.org and you know,
[02:09:13.680 --> 02:09:17.680]   learn a little bit about internet safety and those kinds of things and that's about it.
[02:09:17.680 --> 02:09:19.680]   It's great for kids.
[02:09:19.680 --> 02:09:20.680]   Listen to radio.
[02:09:20.680 --> 02:09:21.680]   Turn on that radio.
[02:09:21.680 --> 02:09:24.680]   It's listening to you.
[02:09:24.680 --> 02:09:26.680]   No, that's the other stuff.
[02:09:26.680 --> 02:09:28.680]   No, that's not the radio.
[02:09:28.680 --> 02:09:29.680]   Radio.
[02:09:29.680 --> 02:09:31.680]   It's not listening to you.
[02:09:31.680 --> 02:09:32.680]   That's why you should listen to that.
[02:09:32.680 --> 02:09:33.680]   That's the new slogan.
[02:09:33.680 --> 02:09:34.680]   Listen to radio.
[02:09:34.680 --> 02:09:36.680]   It's not listening to you.
[02:09:36.680 --> 02:09:37.680]   Exactly.
[02:09:37.680 --> 02:09:41.680]   We do Twitter every Sunday afternoon, 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern,
[02:09:41.680 --> 02:09:42.680]   2200 UTC.
[02:09:42.680 --> 02:09:44.680]   Please stop by and watch us.
[02:09:44.680 --> 02:09:45.680]   We do it live.
[02:09:45.680 --> 02:09:49.680]   So you can participate in the chatroom live at IRC.twit.tv.
[02:09:49.680 --> 02:09:52.680]   The live stream is on Twit.tv/live.
[02:09:52.680 --> 02:09:54.680]   We even invite you to join us in the studio.
[02:09:54.680 --> 02:09:58.680]   If you're in the Northern California area, just email tickets at Twit.tv.
[02:09:58.680 --> 02:09:59.680]   There's no charge.
[02:09:59.680 --> 02:10:02.680]   We'd like to make sure, you know, we have a chair ready for you.
[02:10:02.680 --> 02:10:05.680]   We had some great visitors, Cooper and Martin from Australia.
[02:10:05.680 --> 02:10:09.680]   We had John from Toronto, Doug from Cascade, Iowa.
[02:10:09.680 --> 02:10:14.680]   He was here for WWDC and Craig from...
[02:10:14.680 --> 02:10:16.680]   Say again?
[02:10:16.680 --> 02:10:17.680]   Michigan.
[02:10:17.680 --> 02:10:18.680]   Michigan.
[02:10:18.680 --> 02:10:19.680]   I didn't.
[02:10:19.680 --> 02:10:20.680]   It's not written on my card.
[02:10:20.680 --> 02:10:21.680]   Thank you guys for being here.
[02:10:21.680 --> 02:10:22.680]   We appreciate it.
[02:10:22.680 --> 02:10:24.680]   If you can't be here live, you can't watch live.
[02:10:24.680 --> 02:10:28.680]   You can always get on to man audio and video of everything we do at Twit,
[02:10:28.680 --> 02:10:34.680]   including this show at our website, Twit.tv, or subscribe in your favorite podcast application.
[02:10:34.680 --> 02:10:35.680]   That way you'll get it automatically.
[02:10:35.680 --> 02:10:40.680]   The minute it's available, as I said, audio and video, whether it's Apple Podcast,
[02:10:40.680 --> 02:10:46.680]   Google Play Music, Stitcher, Slacker, Pocket Casts, we're everywhere.
[02:10:46.680 --> 02:10:47.680]   Thanks for being here.
[02:10:47.680 --> 02:10:48.680]   Thanks for watching.
[02:10:48.680 --> 02:10:50.680]   Thanks for listening and we'll see you next time.
[02:10:50.680 --> 02:10:51.680]   Another Twit.
[02:10:51.680 --> 02:10:52.680]   It's in the can.
[02:10:52.680 --> 02:10:53.680]   Oh, bye.
[02:10:53.680 --> 02:10:56.680]   [music]
[02:10:56.680 --> 02:10:57.680]   Do it the Twit.
[02:10:57.680 --> 02:10:58.680]   All right.
[02:10:58.680 --> 02:11:00.680]   Do it the Twit, baby.
[02:11:00.680 --> 02:11:01.680]   Do it the Twit.
[02:11:01.680 --> 02:11:02.680]   All right.
[02:11:02.680 --> 02:11:03.680]   Do it the Twit.
[02:11:03.680 --> 02:11:06.680]   Oh, I forgot to mention kind of a big breaking story.
[02:11:06.680 --> 02:11:07.680]   Shoot.
[02:11:07.680 --> 02:11:09.680]   Microsoft has apparently acquired GitHub.
[02:11:09.680 --> 02:11:10.680]   GitHub.
[02:11:10.680 --> 02:11:11.680]   Yeah.
[02:11:11.680 --> 02:11:12.680]   It's only a rumor though.
[02:11:12.680 --> 02:11:13.680]   It's not confirmed.
[02:11:13.680 --> 02:11:17.680]   Yeah, I would have liked to talk about it, but that is a huge story.
[02:11:17.680 --> 02:11:23.680]   Yeah, that would have been a good segue from Microsoft and Google battle because I think
[02:11:23.680 --> 02:11:26.680]   Google stopped building Google code because of GitHub.
[02:11:26.680 --> 02:11:30.680]   I didn't talk about the GitHub one because it's only rumored.
[02:11:30.680 --> 02:11:31.680]   Yeah.
[02:11:31.680 --> 02:11:32.680]   There's no facts here.
[02:11:32.680 --> 02:11:35.680]   But it would be good to get your all's analysis.
[02:11:35.680 --> 02:11:39.680]   Why does Microsoft want a code sharing site?
[02:11:39.680 --> 02:11:43.680]   What would be the -- I think the use GitHub now.
[02:11:43.680 --> 02:11:46.680]   I think they've settled all their stuff on GitHub now, is it not?
[02:11:46.680 --> 02:11:50.680]   Yeah, I think the relationship with indie developers is important.
[02:11:50.680 --> 02:11:53.680]   That's a big thing for Microsoft these days, actually.
[02:11:53.680 --> 02:11:54.680]   On RAM to Azure.
[02:11:54.680 --> 02:11:55.680]   Yeah.
[02:11:55.680 --> 02:11:56.680]   So the I think we're reporting it.
[02:11:56.680 --> 02:11:57.680]   GitHub is true.
[02:11:57.680 --> 02:11:58.680]   Yeah.
[02:11:58.680 --> 02:11:59.680]   GitHub.
[02:11:59.680 --> 02:12:00.680]   It's a little bit of a bug.
[02:12:00.680 --> 02:12:01.680]   I think it's true.
[02:12:01.680 --> 02:12:03.680]   And they say they'll announce Monday and I think that's true.
[02:12:03.680 --> 02:12:07.680]   Because there's not going to be any news on Monday with a WWE thing.
[02:12:07.680 --> 02:12:08.680]   Yeah.
[02:12:08.680 --> 02:12:09.680]   Actually, you know there's not going to be any news, actually.
[02:12:09.680 --> 02:12:11.680]   It's going to be such a boring -- I know.
[02:12:11.680 --> 02:12:12.680]   I'm really disappointed.
[02:12:12.680 --> 02:12:15.680]   With this backache, I'm actually debating with Erminal.
[02:12:15.680 --> 02:12:16.680]   Yeah, it's going to be dull.
[02:12:16.680 --> 02:12:20.680]   I don't want to fit in a chair for two hours with any Tim Cook and friends.
[02:12:20.680 --> 02:12:21.680]   Yeah.
[02:12:21.680 --> 02:12:26.680]   It's like what Microsoft bought LinkedIn so that they could get the office, the corporate
[02:12:26.680 --> 02:12:30.680]   value of the network that's inside of LinkedIn and then bind it into Microsoft Office.
[02:12:30.680 --> 02:12:31.680]   Absolutely.
[02:12:31.680 --> 02:12:35.680]   So you're seeing things like their dynamics and their share point.
[02:12:35.680 --> 02:12:39.680]   Salespeople can go out there and automatically click a button.
[02:12:39.680 --> 02:12:44.040]   And if you know who your customer is, the name of the person, then they can actually build
[02:12:44.040 --> 02:12:48.680]   a profile of that person and the salesperson then knows a hell of a lot more about the victim.
[02:12:48.680 --> 02:12:51.680]   Sorry, customer, potential customer, prospect, victim.
[02:12:51.680 --> 02:12:52.680]   Yeah.
[02:12:52.680 --> 02:12:53.680]   And then like they know --
[02:12:53.680 --> 02:12:58.680]   So Google still -- what are they used for their code repost?
[02:12:58.680 --> 02:13:03.680]   They used to have Google code, but they closed that because all their folks were using GitHub.
[02:13:03.680 --> 02:13:04.680]   They shifted the gift to GitHub.
[02:13:04.680 --> 02:13:05.680]   Yeah, everybody loves GitHub.
[02:13:05.680 --> 02:13:06.680]   I'm not sure how to think of the thing.
[02:13:06.680 --> 02:13:07.680]   I love the company.
[02:13:07.680 --> 02:13:12.680]   There's been some less than savory stuff at the company.
[02:13:12.680 --> 02:13:14.680]   But I love GitHub.
[02:13:14.680 --> 02:13:19.680]   I do love -- Google Fire, Google Code backup, if that happens.
[02:13:19.680 --> 02:13:21.680]   I think there is other GitLab.
[02:13:21.680 --> 02:13:23.680]   There's other Git hosting.
[02:13:23.680 --> 02:13:25.680]   And of course, you could run your own Git hosting.
[02:13:25.680 --> 02:13:27.680]   There's no reason why you wouldn't want to.
[02:13:27.680 --> 02:13:29.680]   I think the future here is serverless.
[02:13:29.680 --> 02:13:34.160]   This idea that you don't actually want to run a container or a virtual machine or you don't
[02:13:34.160 --> 02:13:35.680]   want to have to worry about any of that.
[02:13:35.680 --> 02:13:38.680]   So if you have GitHub, you could have this thing where it's like a click to deploy.
[02:13:38.680 --> 02:13:42.680]   It automatically takes you out of GitHub and straight into Azure serverless.
[02:13:42.680 --> 02:13:44.680]   And it'll take a couple of years for that to work out.
[02:13:44.680 --> 02:13:45.680]   That sounds sweet.
[02:13:45.680 --> 02:13:47.680]   Guys, I'm going to say goodbye.
[02:13:47.680 --> 02:13:48.680]   I got to go.
[02:13:48.680 --> 02:13:49.680]   All right, Larry.
[02:13:49.680 --> 02:13:50.680]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[02:13:50.680 --> 02:13:51.680]   It's gone on way too long.
[02:13:51.680 --> 02:13:52.680]   Go watch the Warriors game.
[02:13:52.680 --> 02:13:53.680]   Talk all your line.
[02:13:53.680 --> 02:13:54.680]   All right.
[02:13:54.680 --> 02:13:56.680]   So that would be my punt.
[02:13:56.680 --> 02:14:00.520]   It would be my punt is they'd look for a tie up where you check your code into GitHub and
[02:14:00.520 --> 02:14:04.760]   then you have your CICD, you have your Jenkins pipeline and all that sort of stuff.
[02:14:04.760 --> 02:14:09.680]   And then it comes straight out of the continuous and it goes straight into production on it.
[02:14:09.680 --> 02:14:10.680]   That's brilliant.
[02:14:10.680 --> 02:14:11.680]   I like that.
[02:14:11.680 --> 02:14:12.680]   Yeah.
[02:14:12.680 --> 02:14:13.680]   And that would be huge.
[02:14:13.680 --> 02:14:17.680]   Yeah, there's a whole bunch of synergies that you could probably do.
[02:14:17.680 --> 02:14:23.920]   I'm thinking about what if you talk to people at various of the big Silicon companies, they
[02:14:23.920 --> 02:14:28.720]   don't have a whole entire teams of people just building that sort of pipeline.
[02:14:28.720 --> 02:14:33.440]   It goes from developer to testing to commissioning to straight into production over and over
[02:14:33.440 --> 02:14:34.440]   and over.
[02:14:34.440 --> 02:14:39.120]   And this would be a way of-- and as Seth said, it would also be bringing the developers closer
[02:14:39.120 --> 02:14:41.320]   to Microsoft and pulling them away from AWS.
[02:14:41.320 --> 02:14:42.320]   They love that.
[02:14:42.320 --> 02:14:44.880]   That's why they do LSW and all that stuff.
[02:14:44.880 --> 02:14:45.880]   Yeah.
[02:14:45.880 --> 02:14:46.880]   All right, guys.
[02:14:46.880 --> 02:14:47.880]   Thanks, Leo.
[02:14:47.880 --> 02:14:48.880]   See you later.
[02:14:48.880 --> 02:14:49.880]   Have a great night.
[02:14:49.880 --> 02:14:50.880]   See you again sometime.
