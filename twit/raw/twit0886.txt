[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400]   It's time for Twit this week in Tech.
[00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:04.000]   We've got a great panel for you.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.760]   Shoshana Weisman joins us from rstreet.org.
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:11.200]   Dan Patterson from CBS radio news.
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:14.680]   Jason Snell from Six Colors and Mac Brake Weekly.
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.840]   We will talk about the quarterly results for not just Apple,
[00:00:17.840 --> 00:00:19.480]   but all the big tech companies.
[00:00:19.480 --> 00:00:21.360]   And what it means for the future?
[00:00:21.360 --> 00:00:23.880]   Yes, as Apple's Luca Maestry said,
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:26.040]   there was a cocktail of headwinds.
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.920]   We'll also talk about the CHIPS Act, $52 billion
[00:00:30.920 --> 00:00:33.200]   to chip companies to build fabs in the US.
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.720]   But is it a good idea?
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:39.800]   And why big tech is making a big play for live sports?
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:42.320]   It's all coming up next on Twit.
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.160]   Podcasts you love.
[00:00:47.160 --> 00:00:49.720]   From people you trust.

[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:43.080]   Yes, I'm back, baby.
[00:02:43.080 --> 00:02:49.080]   Thanks so much to Devendra Harderwar and Jason Howell, who filled in for the last two weeks.
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:52.080]   One while I was on a cruise, one while I was under the weather from COVID.
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:53.080]   But I'm back.
[00:02:53.080 --> 00:02:55.080]   I'm testing negative and I'm ready to play.
[00:02:55.080 --> 00:02:59.080]   Let's welcome our panel of tech journalists.
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:02.080]   Jason Snell is here on Tuesdays.
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:07.080]   We thought because we've got Apple numbers, it'd be great to have Mr. Six Colors on.
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:08.080]   Hi, Jason.
[00:03:08.080 --> 00:03:10.080]   It's good to be here yet again.
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:14.080]   I think I was scheduled for this before I became a regular and Mac break weekly.
[00:03:14.080 --> 00:03:16.080]   It was weird.
[00:03:16.080 --> 00:03:18.080]   But now I'm on every Tuesday and I'm also here too.
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:19.080]   I love it here.
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:20.080]   I don't want to.
[00:03:20.080 --> 00:03:21.080]   I won't burn you out.
[00:03:21.080 --> 00:03:22.080]   I promise.
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:24.080]   We love, of course, having you on all the time.
[00:03:24.080 --> 00:03:29.080]   I thought it'd be a good chance for everybody who watches Twit to know that you are now a regular
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:30.080]   Renee Richie.
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:31.080]   Some people may know.
[00:03:31.080 --> 00:03:37.080]   Took a job with YouTube as creator liaison and YouTube won't let them do a podcast with us.
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:40.080]   But fortunately, Jason Snell is a great guy.
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:42.080]   I'm still working in my garage.
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.080]   Take that YouTube.
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:44.080]   I love it.
[00:03:44.080 --> 00:03:45.080]   I love it.
[00:03:45.080 --> 00:03:49.080]   Also with us, longtime technology reporter at CBS News.
[00:03:49.080 --> 00:03:50.080]   He's got a new position.
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:51.080]   We'll talk about that in a second.
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:53.080]   Dan Patterson, great to see you.
[00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:55.080]   Great to be here.
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.080]   Yeah.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:01.080]   You are now editorial director at Cyber Six Gill, which is a security firm.
[00:04:01.080 --> 00:04:02.080]   Yeah.
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:04.080]   A threat intelligence company.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:09.080]   It's editorial, so it's not marketing, which means I can do this and they won't be upset
[00:04:09.080 --> 00:04:11.080]   and CBS won't be upset.
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:18.080]   I'm leaving CBS where I've left CBS, but I'll continue to contribute as a technology contributor
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.080]   there and write and report.
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:28.080]   And I'm also joined by my snoozy, but potentially, barking dog Fred.
[00:04:28.080 --> 00:04:31.080]   Fred is a great name for a dog.
[00:04:31.080 --> 00:04:36.080]   Joined by the Snapchat hot dog, Shoshana Weisman is here.
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:37.080]   Hello, Shoshana.
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:39.080]   It's great to see you.
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:43.080]   First time on Twit, we had Shoshana on Twig a couple of weeks ago and we were so wonderful.
[00:04:43.080 --> 00:04:45.080]   I said, "Let's get her back."
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:46.080]   She knows.
[00:04:46.080 --> 00:04:49.080]   She lives in a pineapple under DC.
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.080]   Get it?
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:53.080]   Head of digital media at rstreet.org.
[00:04:53.080 --> 00:04:58.080]   She is a fabulous, fabulous smart person.
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:01.080]   You could find her medium at Senator Shoshana.
[00:05:01.080 --> 00:05:02.080]   What's with the senator?
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.080]   Are you a senator?
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:09.080]   No, when I was 14, I wanted to be one and by the time all my stuff was verified, I just
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.080]   figured might as well keep it.
[00:05:10.080 --> 00:05:11.080]   I like it.
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:16.080]   So you've been Senator Shoshana since the age of 14.
[00:05:16.080 --> 00:05:17.080]   Yeah.
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.080]   Yeah.
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.080]   Long time nerd.
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:23.080]   Like really like just born out of the womb with like a computer, you know?
[00:05:23.080 --> 00:05:24.080]   A walk.
[00:05:24.080 --> 00:05:26.080]   You're a policy walk.
[00:05:26.080 --> 00:05:27.080]   Yeah.
[00:05:27.080 --> 00:05:28.080]   Exactly right.
[00:05:28.080 --> 00:05:30.080]   Well, it's great to have all three of you.
[00:05:30.080 --> 00:05:35.680]   It's really nice to come back to the show with a strong panel because well, you've heard
[00:05:35.680 --> 00:05:37.080]   a brain fog?
[00:05:37.080 --> 00:05:39.080]   Yes, it is real.
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:40.080]   It is real.
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:41.600]   And so you'll forgive me.
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:42.680]   I've been getting for some reason.
[00:05:42.680 --> 00:05:46.080]   I don't feel like I have it, but I've been getting dates wrong all week.
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:54.720]   So I said, you know, silly things like the Lisa came out in '78 or 2001, a space odyssey
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:56.760]   was in the '70s.
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.720]   I knew better than that.
[00:05:58.720 --> 00:06:07.440]   The CHIPS Act has cleared Congress, which is a big deal for the tech sector still to
[00:06:07.440 --> 00:06:08.680]   be signed by the president.
[00:06:08.680 --> 00:06:11.880]   No reason to think he won't.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:18.080]   This is $52 billion, among other things, $52 billion in funding for domestic semiconductor
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:20.200]   manufacturing.
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.960]   Some people have said this should have passed years ago.
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:28.520]   China has in the meantime kind of taken over for semiconductor manufacturing, but I noted
[00:06:28.520 --> 00:06:33.160]   the TSMC, the Taiwan semiconductor manufacturing company has already opened a plant in the
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:34.160]   US.
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:40.200]   Intel was waiting to break ground on its $20 billion fab in Arizona till this past.
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:48.080]   So this is important not only for competitiveness, but also for supply chain issues.
[00:06:48.080 --> 00:06:50.280]   Shoshana, you cover DC.
[00:06:50.280 --> 00:06:53.480]   Do you cover these kinds of stories?
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:56.120]   Some of my colleagues work on this kind of stuff.
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:07:00.520]   I do have concerns just any time the government jumps in to make something more competitive.
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:05.680]   And it can sometimes displace private investment, which we don't want to discourage.
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:10.520]   But more than anything, even despite my concerns, I think it comes at a really good time noting
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:13.520]   that we'll get CHIPS while there's an avocado shortage.
[00:07:13.520 --> 00:07:15.440]   I mean, sorry, avocado access.
[00:07:15.440 --> 00:07:17.360]   We have too many avocados.
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:18.600]   There have been some stories on it.
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:20.440]   I thought we had too few avocados.
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.440]   There's too many.
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:22.440]   No, very recently.
[00:07:22.440 --> 00:07:23.960]   Yeah, there's too many.
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:26.000]   So if any a time--
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   More chips.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   --make this happen, it would be now.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.400]   More chips is now a necessity.
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.920]   But that actually kind of is an interesting point.
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:37.400]   They're putting the thumb on the scale, and government moves at a different pace than
[00:07:37.400 --> 00:07:40.040]   industry.
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:42.880]   The avocado shortage is a perfect example.
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:47.880]   The FDA inspectors were mad at Mexican avocado producers because they threatened some of
[00:07:47.880 --> 00:07:48.880]   the inspectors.
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:53.600]   They cut off Mexican avocados, which caused a shortage.
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:55.400]   And then I guess what happened?
[00:07:55.400 --> 00:07:57.520]   They turned the faucet back on?
[00:07:57.520 --> 00:08:01.040]   Did you stump your panel?
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.480]   Do you think we're avocado experts?
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:08.080]   You see the know what was going on in the avocado wars.
[00:08:08.080 --> 00:08:10.200]   All right, well, anyway.
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:14.440]   I didn't know that avocados were one supposed to be coming from my faucet.
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:18.760]   I'm going to talk to my utility commission about that.
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.840]   They try to take as much as they can.
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:23.160]   So I'm going to make sure that that's fixed.
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:27.200]   But yeah, I do worry about government putting its thumb on the scale sometimes.
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:30.240]   And I know that's my libertarian bent, but it's genuine.
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:36.160]   It's from a place of like when we didn't allow baby formulas from abroad and then our few
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:39.040]   corporations producing it, we're having trouble.
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:41.200]   And then the FDA is like, oh, well, we can wait.
[00:08:41.200 --> 00:08:42.200]   We can wait.
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:46.320]   Oops, maybe we should approve these ones that are totally fine and just have different
[00:08:46.320 --> 00:08:47.320]   labeling.
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:50.120]   I'm always thinking about it in that perspective.
[00:08:50.120 --> 00:08:51.840]   Appropriately.
[00:08:51.840 --> 00:08:55.680]   But at the same time, and we always have this debate, especially with the technology sector
[00:08:55.680 --> 00:09:01.240]   and government, on the one hand, I don't really want the technology sector to regulate
[00:09:01.240 --> 00:09:02.720]   itself.
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:04.960]   But on the other hand, is government the right way to do it.
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:07.560]   But I don't know what other solution we have, right?
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:11.920]   This is a really weird scenario too, because what we're talking about, and this was obviously
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:17.280]   this past with some support from both parties, it's this strange combination of, you know,
[00:09:17.280 --> 00:09:24.280]   on the one hand, it is the government giving money to Intel and I think to TSMC for some
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:26.480]   American fabs.
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:31.800]   And that is handing money to a for profit corporation just right out of the government.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:33.160]   And that goes to that.
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:37.640]   That has those echoes of like Airbus getting European subsidies and Boeing crying foul and
[00:09:37.640 --> 00:09:38.640]   all of that.
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:43.000]   At the same time though, there's this perception that China itself is funding all of its chip
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:50.920]   gains in China, which is dangerous, some view because of not only China's increased prowess,
[00:09:50.920 --> 00:09:55.640]   but the fact that Taiwan semiconductor is basically number one in this space right now.
[00:09:55.640 --> 00:10:02.680]   And if you eliminate the need for Taiwan semiconductor to be number one, you're also actually eliminating
[00:10:02.680 --> 00:10:07.680]   potentially one of the things that keeps China from invading Taiwan.
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:10.640]   So there's geopolitics stuff going on here too.
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:15.920]   I feel like maybe in this case, what brought the Republicans over to the Chips Act was
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:22.960]   a little bit more of the geopolitics of we need to have American chip fabs and not just
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:28.680]   have everything be in Taiwan and China, rather than the kind of corporate welfare aspect of
[00:10:28.680 --> 00:10:31.440]   it, because it is that, but it's also this other thing.
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:32.440]   Yeah.
[00:10:32.440 --> 00:10:33.440]   Yeah.
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:36.160]   And I think it was, and I'm sorry to interrupt you, Jason, but I think, you know, to that
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:40.320]   point, I think, and it might be in this first story actually, I think it was criticized by
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:46.240]   Bernie Sanders for being what he called a blank check.
[00:10:46.240 --> 00:10:50.400]   So a giveaway to some of these very large companies.
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:51.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:52.400]   He said that exactly.
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:53.400]   Yeah.
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:11:00.360]   And these companies are massively profitable, as we're going to discuss momentarily.
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:04.040]   It's funny when you get Bernie Sanders on one side and conservatives on the other side
[00:11:04.040 --> 00:11:05.520]   agreeing on something.
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:08.960]   I don't know what that is.
[00:11:08.960 --> 00:11:09.960]   That's a win for Biden.
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:10.960]   Yes.
[00:11:10.960 --> 00:11:11.960]   I guess.
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.200]   I guess Bernie does not look happy here.
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:16.760]   He's very, very unhappy about this.
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:25.440]   And I agree that, you know, giving, Bernie says $76 billion to one of the most profitable
[00:11:25.440 --> 00:11:27.360]   sectors in the country.
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:32.480]   It does seem like a lot, but hey, you know, it's also important for competitive, it's
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:39.040]   competitive, it's also important as you point out, Jason, for geo-political issues.
[00:11:39.040 --> 00:11:40.040]   So I don't know.
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:41.040]   Yeah.
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:43.800]   I mean, I think the truth is that I think fabs have not been.
[00:11:43.800 --> 00:11:46.960]   I mean, there's a reason that the fabs aren't built in the US anymore, right?
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.720]   And there is a reason for that.
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:52.160]   And so what they're trying to do here is provide this extra incentive to say, no, no,
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:54.600]   no, we really want there to be fabs in the US.
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:57.760]   And if you're not going to build them of your own free will, what if we sweeten the pot
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:58.760]   a little bit?
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:02.560]   And I get that from a strategic standpoint, but it does always make you do a double take
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:06.480]   because as Shashana said, you know, you're also, it's the government intervening in a
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:11.920]   market and basically distorting the market by saying we will write you a check for, you
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:16.120]   know, for no reason other than that we want you to build your fab here instead of in another
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:17.120]   country.
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:18.120]   Yeah.
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:22.440]   I think we can all agree though, billions to this is good, billions to the National Science
[00:12:22.440 --> 00:12:26.760]   Foundation for semiconductor manufacturing research.
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:33.760]   This is, you know, in a way, this has been a because of Apple investing so much for iPhone
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:39.280]   production with TSMC and Foxconn and they're getting the benefit because they're taking
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:40.280]   that money.
[00:12:40.280 --> 00:12:44.860]   TSMC has done that to really improve their processes to get down to five and three nanometer
[00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:48.920]   processes thanks to this big influx of money from Apple computers so that they could build
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:50.320]   chips for the iPhone.
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:56.600]   I think maybe this is a fair place to put money NSF for semiconductor research because
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:58.440]   we do need to maintain competitiveness.
[00:12:58.440 --> 00:13:02.560]   So I think that one is probably nonpartisan.
[00:13:02.560 --> 00:13:06.440]   It's funny too because you think about how Intel has just badly misplayed everything
[00:13:06.440 --> 00:13:11.560]   the last decade and they continue to do so and although they're making some changes,
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:13.280]   you know, why did Apple go to TSMC?
[00:13:13.280 --> 00:13:17.760]   Well, one of the reasons is that Intel for a long time had the policy that they weren't
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:20.880]   going to make any chips that they didn't themselves design.
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:25.520]   And so, and then they kind of blew the design and as a result, they fell behind TSMC.
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:27.440]   So I agree.
[00:13:27.440 --> 00:13:31.680]   It's great to see some investment in pure, pure research because that's one way that
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:36.680]   you end up with people in the United States who are on the forefront of chip technology
[00:13:36.680 --> 00:13:39.560]   and that leads to them going into industry.
[00:13:39.560 --> 00:13:44.280]   And that's a more of a kind of fertilization approach to this rather than writing a big
[00:13:44.280 --> 00:13:47.960]   check so that Intel builds a fab in Phoenix.
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:50.840]   Meanwhile Intel's quarterly results, not very good.
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:55.840]   This was a big quarterly results week for all of the tech companies.
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:14:06.620]   Well, announced that they, in revenue decline, 22% year over year, revenue missed the market
[00:14:06.620 --> 00:14:09.120]   consensus by 14%.
[00:14:09.120 --> 00:14:11.240]   So that's why the stock market punished them.
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:17.400]   This is, I always have to explain, no, but we don't care about how the stock market feels
[00:14:17.400 --> 00:14:18.480]   about this.
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:22.880]   What we care about is how this indicates how these businesses are doing.
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:28.160]   But the stock market thought they'd do better until shares went down 10% when they came
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:30.320]   out with these results.
[00:14:30.320 --> 00:14:39.480]   $454 million net loss compared with a net income of $5 billion in the quarter of a year
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.480]   ago.
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.240]   That's a big shift.
[00:14:42.240 --> 00:14:44.000]   Intel not doing well at all.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:47.640]   Gross margin down.
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:50.960]   Basically Intel's suffering.
[00:14:50.960 --> 00:14:56.120]   And now you're going to really say, are we giving money to the wrong company?
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:15:00.360]   Intel, when it announced this, also announced that they were killing their Optane memory
[00:15:00.360 --> 00:15:08.560]   business, which I remember reporting five or six years ago, this being the future of
[00:15:08.560 --> 00:15:13.840]   memory, this, what do they call it, Tri-X stacked memory.
[00:15:13.840 --> 00:15:19.920]   Super fast it was being used not only for RAM, but for kind of RAM-based SSDs.
[00:15:19.920 --> 00:15:25.200]   That's going to cost them $559 million in excess inventory.
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:29.280]   They made too much and they're writing it all off.
[00:15:29.280 --> 00:15:32.280]   That's one of the reasons Intel didn't do very well.
[00:15:32.280 --> 00:15:33.280]   Wow.
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:34.280]   They stopped.
[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:36.520]   Yeah, I love how much money we're giving them right now.
[00:15:36.520 --> 00:15:38.440]   I'm feeling really good about that.
[00:15:38.440 --> 00:15:40.120]   Let's give them some billions of dollars.
[00:15:40.120 --> 00:15:44.240]   Make up for this poorly managed business that's going down the tubes.
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:52.840]   The 3D Xpoint technology, I don't know if this is a slam on the technology or in Intel's
[00:15:52.840 --> 00:15:55.200]   management of it.
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:59.880]   They had stopped producing Optane storage products for client PCs.
[00:15:59.880 --> 00:16:05.640]   They sold their NAND business already to Hynix, SK Hynix.
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:12.320]   I've offline chatted with Alan Melvantano, who is our SSD expert, ended up leaving PC
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:16.040]   perspective and going to work for Intel about this.
[00:16:16.040 --> 00:16:19.320]   He says, "It'd be a little bit politically difficult for me to come on and talk about
[00:16:19.320 --> 00:16:24.120]   it, but at some point we will get Alan on to explain.
[00:16:24.120 --> 00:16:30.720]   Is it a problem with 3D Xpoint technology itself or is it just mismanaged?
[00:16:30.720 --> 00:16:34.800]   A mismanaged business."
[00:16:34.800 --> 00:16:41.280]   Jack Gelsinger said the industry has shifted to something called CXL based architectures,
[00:16:41.280 --> 00:16:44.520]   which I guess is preferable to cross point.
[00:16:44.520 --> 00:16:46.680]   I don't know.
[00:16:46.680 --> 00:16:51.520]   They sold the fab to Texas Instruments so they can't even make this stuff, but they're still
[00:16:51.520 --> 00:16:56.920]   stuck with hundreds of millions of dollars in inventory.
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.680]   Wow.
[00:16:58.680 --> 00:17:00.680]   Wow.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:07.560]   Weirdly, Tom's hardware is pointing this out, last week we saw initial tests of their next
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:13.280]   generation Optane memory modules, their DDR5 modules, Crows Pass.
[00:17:13.280 --> 00:17:17.640]   They will not now debut even though we saw the results last week.
[00:17:17.640 --> 00:17:23.760]   So $559 million down the tubes with Optane.
[00:17:23.760 --> 00:17:26.200]   Should we do better stories, happier stories?
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:30.640]   Apple's quarter was a little bit better.
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:33.800]   There's this guy named Jason Snell does these beautiful color graphs.
[00:17:33.800 --> 00:17:34.800]   Whoops.
[00:17:34.800 --> 00:17:35.800]   What happened?
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:36.800]   There we go.
[00:17:36.800 --> 00:17:39.280]   Does these beautiful color graphs?
[00:17:39.280 --> 00:17:42.200]   $83 billion in revenue.
[00:17:42.200 --> 00:17:43.200]   But...
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:47.680]   It was a record third quarter for them and yet everybody's sort of like breathing a sigh
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:50.200]   of relief that it wasn't a bigger downer.
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:53.600]   Yeah, and this is one where services shrink, right?
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.520]   Services down, I sound down.
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:18:00.960]   Max sales down, 10% iPad sales down, 2% iPhone up, 3%.
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:04.680]   Services were up 13%, but not as much as historically they'd been up.
[00:18:04.680 --> 00:18:08.600]   That's one of the weird things about tech is you can have growth, but if it's not fast
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:09.600]   enough, that's bad.
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:10.600]   Yeah.
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:15.000]   Yeah, because services actually did still grow by 10 plus percent, but it was down sequentially
[00:18:15.000 --> 00:18:18.040]   and that hasn't happened in two years.
[00:18:18.040 --> 00:18:19.720]   Some of this is supply chain base, right?
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:25.400]   Like the Mac has had a record run and it went down this quarter a lot.
[00:18:25.400 --> 00:18:30.960]   But when you ask Tim Cook and they do a call with analysts after they do the results, what
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:37.840]   Tim Cook says is it's entirely based on a lack of supply, that they assemble most Max
[00:18:37.840 --> 00:18:42.560]   and Shanghai and there were Shanghai COVID shutdowns during the quarter and just before
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:45.840]   the quarter started, that meant that they basically couldn't make enough Max.
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:49.680]   And if you tried to buy a Mac in the last three months, you know this because they were
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:50.680]   really hard to get.
[00:18:50.680 --> 00:18:53.000]   Certain models were very hard to get.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.920]   So some of it, I mean, that's not the worst problem to have.
[00:18:55.920 --> 00:18:59.280]   Say, oh yeah, people really wanted to buy our stuff, but we didn't have enough for them.
[00:18:59.280 --> 00:19:01.440]   It's better than nobody wanting your stuff.
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:06.320]   And of course, Wall Street was relieved that the iPhone sales were okay because the iPhone
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:11.640]   is half of Apple's business at least and on, you know, in most quarters and that it was
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:12.640]   not down.
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:16.480]   They were, you know, because I think the stock market's been so rough lately, especially in
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:17.480]   the tech sector.
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:20.760]   I think all the analysts were really relieved that Apple did okay.
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:24.360]   And again, okay for Apple, it was still a record third quarter for them.
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:29.080]   Okay, for Apple is pretty great for just about anybody else, but there were some of
[00:19:29.080 --> 00:19:34.720]   these signs and they said in their talk with analysts afterward that in certain areas,
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:38.920]   they definitely felt like there were macroeconomic issues that were hitting their products, not
[00:19:38.920 --> 00:19:39.920]   on the iPhone.
[00:19:39.920 --> 00:19:43.440]   They said literally, if you looked at the iPhone, you would never imagine there were
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:49.720]   any macroeconomic issues, but in wearables of all things, it seems like they felt like
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:53.000]   there were people who are like, yeah, I'm not going to buy an Apple watch or I'm not
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   going to buy AirPods.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.520]   And so they took a hit there.
[00:19:56.520 --> 00:20:03.200]   But you know, it's generally, I would say it's a good quarter, at least by Apple standards,
[00:20:03.200 --> 00:20:06.960]   maybe not a shooting off into the stratosphere quarter, but the third quarter is never really
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:11.640]   one of their best and they did okay and they had all those supply constraints and that,
[00:20:11.640 --> 00:20:14.280]   you know, it was a little less than $4 billion.
[00:20:14.280 --> 00:20:18.480]   They figured that they left on the table because they couldn't sell product because it couldn't
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:19.800]   make it fast enough.
[00:20:19.800 --> 00:20:22.760]   So it's a weird, yeah, it's a weird time for them.
[00:20:22.760 --> 00:20:26.440]   But again, I always get the sense from the Apple executives that they're a little bit
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:34.000]   embarrassed to be making so much money and doing so well when things are so volatile.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:36.400]   And I also, one other note I wanted to mention was just foreign exchange.
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:41.280]   We don't think about this a lot or if you're an American, you may know the dollar strong
[00:20:41.280 --> 00:20:44.600]   right now or if you go to Europe right now, it's kind of one to one with Euro, which is
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:49.800]   great if you're a tourist, really bad if you're Apple because Apple's based here.
[00:20:49.800 --> 00:20:56.360]   Those foreign exchange rates mean that they can see, you know, $4, $5 billion less in a
[00:20:56.360 --> 00:21:01.000]   quarter just based on foreign exchange and although they do currency hedging and stuff
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:03.960]   to try and balance it out, there's only so much they can do.
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:09.960]   So the line of the week was from the CFO of Apple, Luca Maestry, who said they faced a
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:13.240]   cocktail of headwinds, which is quite a mixed metaphor.
[00:21:13.240 --> 00:21:14.240]   But he's not wrong.
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:18.480]   I love that phrase, a cocktail of headwinds.
[00:21:18.480 --> 00:21:22.600]   So you named them supply chain.
[00:21:22.600 --> 00:21:25.520]   So demand exceeded supply, they couldn't make enough.
[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:28.600]   They could have sold more if they could only have made them.
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:31.040]   Recession hurting customers.
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:33.160]   So they didn't want to buy Apple watches.
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:35.160]   Their entire business in Russia is gone.
[00:21:35.160 --> 00:21:38.040]   So that's a headwind because you're comparing it to last year.
[00:21:38.040 --> 00:21:39.040]   Yeah.
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:40.960]   Exchange rate unfavorable.
[00:21:40.960 --> 00:21:45.000]   That's a headwind, a cocktail of them.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.760]   Don't drink the headwind cocktail, by the way.
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:48.120]   No, doesn't sound very pleasant.
[00:21:48.120 --> 00:21:49.120]   Don't recommend.
[00:21:49.120 --> 00:21:50.120]   It's just going to make you sad.
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:21:51.120]   It didn't make the relative.
[00:21:51.120 --> 00:21:53.840]   Although it's Apple, it may make you very rich though.
[00:21:53.840 --> 00:21:55.160]   It makes the stock market sad.
[00:21:55.160 --> 00:21:56.960]   I think they're 1.8%.
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:21:58.960]   I mean, yeah, they're really, I think it's relief.
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:02.040]   I think they were really worried that Apple was going to take a tumble like the other tech
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:03.040]   stocks.
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:04.920]   And again, like for Apple, it's a little sluggish.
[00:22:04.920 --> 00:22:07.760]   But again, Apple sluggish is not anyone else's sluggish.
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:08.760]   Yeah.
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:10.480]   It's not meta sluggish.
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:12.280]   Oh, meta.
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:14.080]   Oh, baby.
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:19.000]   Meta, not happy right now.
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:23.800]   Let's-- I'll get to the meta story in a little bit because Mark Zuckerberg is already is bracing
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:24.800]   people.
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:30.120]   He had an all hands meeting last month in which he said, get ready for an intense period.
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:31.960]   We'll get to them.
[00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:34.960]   They didn't announce any results this week to that.
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.560]   I don't think so.
[00:22:36.560 --> 00:22:39.960]   So let's go through the other results.
[00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:44.280]   Microsoft had a fairly good quarter.
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:48.440]   Their revenue, $51.9 billion.
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:55.880]   That's up 12% operating income, $20.5 billion.
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:57.040]   That's up 8%.
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:58.840]   Net income, $16.7 billion.
[00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:02.400]   You know, you make $3 months in 12 weeks.
[00:23:02.400 --> 00:23:04.240]   You make $16.7 billion.
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:05.960]   I think it's a good day.
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:09.520]   I think it's a day to celebrate.
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:10.520]   Some things were not up.
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:14.800]   Xbox gaming was down.
[00:23:14.800 --> 00:23:18.880]   I think the-- I think Azure and Cloud was up.
[00:23:18.880 --> 00:23:22.560]   Microsoft Muddies the Waters a little bit in their quarterly reparts because they mix
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:27.360]   up all these businesses into these weird kind of categories.
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:31.240]   Office commercial products and cloud services.
[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:34.520]   That's a category, but that was up 9%.
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:41.320]   It's consumer products and cloud services up 9%, LinkedIn revenue up 26%.
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:43.440]   So a good quarter from Microsoft.
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.720]   OEM revenue on Windows down a little bit.
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:50.880]   That's because the PC market suffered from supply chain issues, just like the Mac market.
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:54.080]   Xbox down 6%.
[00:23:54.080 --> 00:24:00.080]   Now the big story I think across the board is search and news advertising revenue.
[00:24:00.080 --> 00:24:10.160]   People got hit, Microsoft got hit, revenue including-- I'm sorry, excluding traffic acquisition
[00:24:10.160 --> 00:24:13.920]   costs, which is a big exclude, up 18%.
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:15.240]   Surface revenue up 10%.
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:17.080]   So a good quarter from Microsoft.
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:21.360]   It's kind of a mixed bag all round.
[00:24:21.360 --> 00:24:25.200]   Amazon jumped on earnings.
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:30.560]   They beat the revenue and have a Rosie Gart guidance for the third quarter.
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:33.360]   Is there a thread to all of this Dan Patterson?
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:37.440]   Is there anything you can conclude from this kind of mixed bag of quarterly results from
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:39.920]   Big Tech?
[00:24:39.920 --> 00:24:41.880]   You know, that's hard.
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:47.760]   On the one hand, this could be related to an economic downturn and a recession and these
[00:24:47.760 --> 00:24:49.440]   macro economic forces.
[00:24:49.440 --> 00:24:54.560]   On the other hand, when I talk to people inside of tech firms, it's just anecdotal.
[00:24:54.560 --> 00:25:00.640]   I'm trying to get a barometer, a sense of how people at these companies think and feel.
[00:25:00.640 --> 00:25:05.800]   There is kind of this sense that we have turned a corner and we're perhaps in a new paradigm
[00:25:05.800 --> 00:25:10.960]   or a new relationship with large technology firms where they have kind of saturated the
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:15.120]   market and each of these companies, while they're undergoing different challenges, they
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:24.480]   are all kind of facing the same existential reflection and they are pulling back.
[00:25:24.480 --> 00:25:29.480]   They're changing or altering their business and looking for new markets.
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:34.240]   So it's hard to answer your question, Leo, because I don't know, but I think that there
[00:25:34.240 --> 00:25:40.120]   is a sense within technology that things are changing and it might not simply be related
[00:25:40.120 --> 00:25:44.640]   to the recession and other factors.
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:50.960]   Maybe looking towards software companies as opposed or content companies as opposed to
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:55.380]   a big tech company's Comcast for instance, which had an overall good quarter, had to
[00:25:55.380 --> 00:26:02.920]   report that they had zero growth in internet subscribers and zero growth in Peacock, their
[00:26:02.920 --> 00:26:07.280]   premium streaming platform.
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:08.280]   That's not good.
[00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:12.120]   Zero growth in ISP customers and Peacock.
[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:14.960]   That's not good.
[00:26:14.960 --> 00:26:19.600]   Comcast owns a lot of other businesses which probably propelled in other directions.
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:20.600]   It's a rough time.
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:21.640]   Peacock, I mean, it's premium, right?
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:26.400]   They do a lot of giveaways and they have an ad business on Peacock.
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:32.840]   So it's not quite as dire as that, but yeah, there is, Vulture did a poll recently of a
[00:26:32.840 --> 00:26:39.480]   bunch of industry people about streaming services and Peacock was right down there by the bottom
[00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:44.720]   and the question was like, are they going to buy something else or merge with something
[00:26:44.720 --> 00:26:47.840]   else because Peacock is problematic.
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:51.400]   It's not terrible, and I think they did a good job with the Olympics, but yeah, they're
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:55.880]   not setting the world on fire and clearly they're not selling premium subs.
[00:26:55.880 --> 00:27:00.240]   They may be getting viewership through the free or cheap version where they're doing
[00:27:00.240 --> 00:27:04.320]   ad sales and then they're making money on the ads and maybe that works for them.
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:08.720]   But the premium level where people are shelling out money just so that they can watch Peacock
[00:27:08.720 --> 00:27:11.960]   stuff flat is tough.
[00:27:11.960 --> 00:27:13.360]   That's a real tough one.
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:15.760]   And Joe and our chatroom is acquisition.
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:16.760]   Yeah.
[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:17.760]   Acquisition?
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:22.920]   Just a hunch that they might try to goose some of those numbers through acquisition.
[00:27:22.920 --> 00:27:23.920]   Yeah, interesting.
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:26.720]   There have been rumors floating around that Apple might buy Netflix.
[00:27:26.720 --> 00:27:31.640]   Tim Jobs at the quarterly analyst call was talking a little bit about their...
[00:27:31.640 --> 00:27:32.640]   Steve Cook, please.
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:33.640]   Take Holly, Tim Jobs.
[00:27:33.640 --> 00:27:34.640]   Did I call him that?
[00:27:34.640 --> 00:27:35.640]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:27:35.640 --> 00:27:36.640]   I met Tim Apple.
[00:27:36.640 --> 00:27:37.640]   It's fun.
[00:27:37.640 --> 00:27:38.640]   Yeah.
[00:27:38.640 --> 00:27:40.560]   I was saying something like we...
[00:27:40.560 --> 00:27:45.920]   Yeah, we're not against acquisitions, but we want to make sure they can be folded in.
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:50.280]   But there have been rumors that they might buy troubled Netflix.
[00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:56.680]   Yeah, he was less down on purchases than he's been in a while and that doesn't necessarily
[00:27:56.680 --> 00:27:58.320]   mean anything, but it makes you wonder.
[00:27:58.320 --> 00:28:04.920]   I mean, everybody who is an expert in the streaming biz and here's my plug for my podcast
[00:28:04.920 --> 00:28:08.260]   downstream where I talked to Julia Alexander about this because she's an expert every
[00:28:08.260 --> 00:28:09.860]   other week.
[00:28:09.860 --> 00:28:11.200]   Everybody expects more consolidation.
[00:28:11.200 --> 00:28:12.200]   It's going to happen.
[00:28:12.200 --> 00:28:13.200]   Apple's got money to spend.
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:18.160]   Whether they want to do stuff like buy somebody outright or whether they'd rather spend that
[00:28:18.160 --> 00:28:22.080]   money on sports rights and stuff like that because they've done some of those deals and
[00:28:22.080 --> 00:28:27.240]   they're more in the works is unclear, but it's hard to imagine in the long run that peacock
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:30.440]   and Paramount+, and HBO Max, right?
[00:28:30.440 --> 00:28:32.920]   Like all of them are just going to be there all on their own.
[00:28:32.920 --> 00:28:34.760]   They feel like they're all in play, don't they?
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:35.760]   Yeah.
[00:28:35.760 --> 00:28:38.200]   Yeah, I think that's a really good point.
[00:28:38.200 --> 00:28:41.520]   And I think that a lot of companies have kind of forgotten how to do the subscription
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:46.400]   model, like not even just in this kind of stuff, but I forgot it might have been BMW
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:49.560]   that's now having like a subscription for a few seats.
[00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:53.000]   Yeah, it's nuts, but all that kind of stuff.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:58.200]   I think they're re they're reinventing the wheel and doing it poorly in a lot of cases
[00:28:58.200 --> 00:29:01.640]   and that maybe companies who kind of know this stuff a little bit better have done this
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:06.120]   stuff for longer or just have a better handle on it might be likely to acquire, but then
[00:29:06.120 --> 00:29:11.560]   you get into like the FTC stuff and the antitrust stuff and like, oh, well, if they acquire anything,
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:13.080]   then they're a big evil company.
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:16.840]   So I think there's some competing forces at play, but I do think a lot of the struggles
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:22.280]   kind of stem from people forgetting how subscription can work, how it's likely to work.
[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:25.840]   And that like, you know, I have Netflix and Hulu and I'm not going to go for Paramount.
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:29.800]   I get Disney just so I can watch the Simpsons, but it would be great if I could just subscribe
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:32.440]   to the Simpsons or something like that.
[00:29:32.440 --> 00:29:36.360]   People are I think kind of just the reinvention of the wheel is going to get old.
[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:40.360]   Just like the shiny object era of social media got old in that same way.
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:46.360]   Do you think that people are rebelling against the nickel and dime monthly fees, you know,
[00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:49.480]   having $27 charges every month?
[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:51.800]   Is that I always thought that might be a problem?
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:55.760]   And yet people like you, Shoshan are kind of, you know, saying, you know, I'm used to it.
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:30:00.760]   I don't have to make a decision about how many I have, but that's not the end of the world.
[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:06.080]   Yeah, I don't think it's going to get people to, you know, to just completely stop all
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:07.080]   kinds of stuff like that.
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:10.360]   But I think you might see people be like, all right, I'm not really using this.
[00:30:10.360 --> 00:30:13.440]   So that comes off and that's kind of where the subscription model suffers.
[00:30:13.440 --> 00:30:16.480]   But you know how they're trying to solve that is with exclusives, right?
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:17.480]   You even said it.
[00:30:17.480 --> 00:30:22.440]   I subscribed to what is it, Disney for the Simpsons.
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:27.560]   That's what people do, they're already described for the Mandalorian or Marvel.
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:29.760]   And that's what Netflix tried to do.
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:33.560]   They've been struggling a little bit lately because they haven't had that tentpole property.
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:36.560]   You know, stranger things didn't drive a lot of subscriptions.
[00:30:36.560 --> 00:30:40.600]   Yeah, I think it's a real challenge because you can churn.
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:45.840]   It's fairly, I mean, it's really hard to churn your cellular or your cable company or whatever,
[00:30:45.840 --> 00:30:46.840]   right?
[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:48.840]   It's hard because there's like you got to get hardware in.
[00:30:48.840 --> 00:30:51.960]   It's so easy to churn streaming.
[00:30:51.960 --> 00:30:56.200]   And I talk to people who say, well, I'm not going to, I'm going to keep three at a time,
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:57.920]   but I'm going to rotate through them.
[00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:01.280]   And then the idea there is if it's, if it's, this is actually one reason why you're going
[00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:04.920]   to see a lot more streaming deals for live sports because what you can't do with live
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:08.920]   sports is say I'm going to wait for the whole season to end and then I'm going to binge
[00:31:08.920 --> 00:31:09.920]   it, right?
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:12.880]   Like you can't do that with like, oh, I'm going to wait for the baseball season to end.
[00:31:12.880 --> 00:31:17.560]   And then I'm going to watch all 162 games, right at once like that you have to be there
[00:31:17.560 --> 00:31:19.120]   for the whole season, right?
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:20.680]   Or the whole NFL season.
[00:31:20.680 --> 00:31:24.400]   But for these others, I think that that's what's happening is instead of it being, I'm going
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:28.360]   to just pick three and those are going to be my ride or die streaming services, it's
[00:31:28.360 --> 00:31:32.720]   going to be more like the live action Star Trek just ended on Paramount+.
[00:31:32.720 --> 00:31:36.360]   And like I heard from a lot of people who said, okay, well, I'm dropping off of that
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:41.480]   and I'm going to go on Disney Plus and get caught up now with the moon night and Ms. Marvel
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:45.640]   and, you know, get ready for the new Star Wars show and that that's their strategy is just
[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:51.320]   kind of picking and choosing and it's so easy to churn through those streaming services.
[00:31:51.320 --> 00:31:56.200]   It makes me wonder if one of the forefronts of streaming in the next few years is going
[00:31:56.200 --> 00:32:00.800]   to be some big discounts if you lock in for a year.
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:02.560]   I mean, they're experimenting with that now.
[00:32:02.560 --> 00:32:06.160]   But I wonder if they're going to, yeah, if they're going to push that even more because
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:07.160]   I've done that.
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:10.280]   I've done a couple of year long deals and there does come that moment where you're like,
[00:32:10.280 --> 00:32:11.880]   well, should I cancel this?
[00:32:11.880 --> 00:32:13.840]   Oh, I've got it for another seven months.
[00:32:13.840 --> 00:32:14.840]   So it doesn't matter.
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:17.520]   And that's kind of brilliant if you're the streaming service.
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:21.440]   Yeah, especially as consumers are more budget conscious.
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:23.640]   Wouldn't that be a good startup?
[00:32:23.640 --> 00:32:29.800]   Like you could you set it up so that it decided and then you say, start this in June and it
[00:32:29.800 --> 00:32:33.880]   in July, start this in August and you just have all your streaming services.
[00:32:33.880 --> 00:32:35.480]   To churn, churn valet.
[00:32:35.480 --> 00:32:36.480]   Yeah, churn valet.
[00:32:36.480 --> 00:32:37.480]   It's good.
[00:32:37.480 --> 00:32:38.480]   Good name.
[00:32:38.480 --> 00:32:39.480]   I like it.
[00:32:39.480 --> 00:32:40.480]   Go register.
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:41.480]   I'll do it.
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:42.480]   Yeah, it'll be in my smart hat.
[00:32:42.480 --> 00:32:43.480]   It'll be one of my one of my startups.
[00:32:43.480 --> 00:32:44.480]   Come on.
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:45.960]   Let's talk about sports around.
[00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:46.960]   Take a break.
[00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:53.080]   And when we come back, Big Tech is coming in and I have to say, I think the broadcasters,
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:57.640]   the satellite guys, they're all a little bit perturbed because here come the big pocket
[00:32:57.640 --> 00:33:00.320]   books going after live sports.
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:01.320]   That's coming up next.
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:02.320]   Great panel.
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:03.320]   Great to have you.
[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:04.320]   Dan Patterson.
[00:33:04.320 --> 00:33:06.000]   Congratulations on the new gig.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.680]   Still a contributor at CBS News.
[00:33:09.680 --> 00:33:13.160]   But now editorial director at cyber six-kill.com.
[00:33:13.160 --> 00:33:14.160]   Always great to see you.
[00:33:14.160 --> 00:33:15.560]   Great to be here.
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:19.160]   A new face on the Twit round table, but always a welcome one.
[00:33:19.160 --> 00:33:20.960]   Shoshana Weisman.
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:24.000]   She's head of digital media at rstreet.org.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.400]   Good to see you and your Snapchat hot dogs.
[00:33:27.400 --> 00:33:28.960]   They're coming to take over.
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:30.200]   They look like they're more.
[00:33:30.200 --> 00:33:32.960]   Ideally, I mean, I think they would have good leadership.
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:36.880]   They're not particularly partisan and I think we need partisan.
[00:33:36.880 --> 00:33:39.160]   Is that an official R Street policy?
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:42.400]   We want the Snapchat hot dogs to run in 2024.
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:44.680]   Yeah, I mean, we're not.
[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:47.520]   We're C3, so we're not allowed to be political.
[00:33:47.520 --> 00:33:51.240]   But we do support the Snapchat hot dog in all its forms.
[00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:56.880]   So if he runs, you know, we'll be there now, but not overly.
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:59.960]   Jason Snell from six colors.
[00:33:59.960 --> 00:34:04.440]   Instead of Snapchat hot dogs, he's got old vintage Macs about to take over.
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:05.960]   They all work.
[00:34:05.960 --> 00:34:06.960]   They all work.
[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:14.640]   I see the the lamp Mac, the Mac plus or Mac original Mac, maybe even the Bondi blue iMac
[00:34:14.640 --> 00:34:18.400]   and Apple II C and the cube.
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:19.400]   Yep.
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:25.680]   Somebody called me on the radio show and said, so should I buy a bunch of PC juniors?
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:31.840]   Because I see that the Apple ones are selling by auction for hundreds of thousand dollars.
[00:34:31.840 --> 00:34:34.320]   I had to give them the bad news.
[00:34:34.320 --> 00:34:35.320]   No.
[00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:36.320]   No, don't do it.
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:42.680]   I'd be like buying a lot of like number one, Tom McFarland comic books from the 90s.
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:44.040]   Seemed like a good investment at the time.
[00:34:44.040 --> 00:34:45.040]   Seemed like a good idea.
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:46.040]   Not a good investment.
[00:34:46.040 --> 00:34:47.040]   Not a good idea.
[00:34:47.040 --> 00:34:52.040]   I told him there is a direct correlation between the number of items manufactured and
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:54.800]   the value of the items down the road.
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:34:59.840]   And I think they're just far too many PC juniors gathering dust and closets all over the world
[00:34:59.840 --> 00:35:02.520]   to make them worth anything at all.
[00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:04.600]   Our show, thank you, all three of you for being here.
[00:35:04.600 --> 00:35:07.120]   It's great to have you on my return.
[00:35:07.120 --> 00:35:11.280]   And again, thanks to Jason Hall who jumped in at the last moment last week because that
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:16.680]   was a sudden discovery and also to Devender Hardwar from Engadget a couple of weeks ago.
[00:35:16.680 --> 00:35:20.800]   Our show today brought to you by userway.org.
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.160]   Userway.org.
[00:35:22.160 --> 00:35:27.760]   I'm talking about making your website ADA compliant, accessible.
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:32.320]   Not only is it the right thing to do because you're opening up your website to a much larger
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:35.080]   group, 60 million plus people.
[00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:38.040]   You have a responsibility to make your site accessible.
[00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.200]   It's a public entity.
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:40.640]   So you got to make it accessible.
[00:35:40.640 --> 00:35:43.200]   And with userway, it's easy.
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:46.640]   That was my biggest concern was, oh, I can't afford it or it's going to be too hard.
[00:35:46.640 --> 00:35:50.680]   No, userway is really affordable and it's really easy and incredible.
[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:52.320]   It's AI powered.
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:58.200]   Tirelessly enforces all the accessibility guidelines, the WCAG WCAG guidelines.
[00:35:58.200 --> 00:35:59.440]   And I love this.
[00:35:59.440 --> 00:36:00.440]   So do our engineers.
[00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:02.200]   It's one line of JavaScript.
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:03.200]   That's it.
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:07.000]   Because userway is so good, it's used by more than a million websites, including the big
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.040]   guys, Coca-Cola, Disney, eBay.
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:14.440]   These are companies that really have to be accessible and userway can do that.
[00:36:14.440 --> 00:36:16.920]   As you get bigger, they scale with you.
[00:36:16.920 --> 00:36:20.480]   If they can handle Disney, absolutely they can handle you.
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:26.160]   They make best in class enterprise level accessibility tools available to you, your small or medium
[00:36:26.160 --> 00:36:27.240]   sized business.
[00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:30.440]   And then as you scale, you need userway and you're ready.
[00:36:30.440 --> 00:36:31.960]   It just makes business sense.
[00:36:31.960 --> 00:36:35.200]   Some of the biggest problems, nav menus, very difficult.
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:39.640]   So the way this works, if you're blind or you're using accessibility tools, there is
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:41.960]   what they call an accessibility layer.
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:44.240]   That's what the screen reader sees.
[00:36:44.240 --> 00:36:48.600]   So really what userway does is make sure that all the information available to the front
[00:36:48.600 --> 00:36:53.800]   page to the sighted user is available to the browser in the accessibility layer.
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.360]   It changes colors.
[00:36:55.360 --> 00:36:57.480]   Now you've got your Pantone color for your business.
[00:36:57.480 --> 00:36:58.520]   Of course we do too.
[00:36:58.520 --> 00:37:00.200]   It doesn't change that.
[00:37:00.200 --> 00:37:04.880]   But it adjusts human luminance so it's easier for people with vision issues to read.
[00:37:04.880 --> 00:37:06.600]   So userway will generate all tags.
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:08.040]   That's one of the reasons it needs AI.
[00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:12.520]   It can actually see the picture and generate an alt tag that matches the picture automatically.
[00:37:12.520 --> 00:37:13.520]   You can go in if you want.
[00:37:13.520 --> 00:37:15.560]   You can modify it, of course.
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:19.760]   It fixes violations like vague links, fixes broken links.
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:23.440]   Make sure that your website uses accessible colors.
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:26.920]   And you'll get a detailed report of all the violations that were fixed on your website.
[00:37:26.920 --> 00:37:28.960]   So you know exactly what it did.
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:30.880]   Plus you can work with it.
[00:37:30.880 --> 00:37:35.440]   Userway integrates seamlessly with your site builder software.
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:40.280]   Let userway help your business meet its compliance goals, improve the experience for your users.

[00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:17.700]   the universal accessibility logo.
[00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:18.700]   Click that.

[00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:45.540]   Today, we thank them so much for their support and for their help making our site more accessible.
[00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:52.780]   Big Tech, New York Times said, "Why Big Tech is making a big play for live sports."
[00:38:52.780 --> 00:38:56.180]   The NFL Sunday ticket was the first one to come up.
[00:38:56.180 --> 00:39:00.460]   This is ... Okay, you sport ball fans have to help me here.
[00:39:00.460 --> 00:39:01.460]   I got you.
[00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:04.580]   This is the games that aren't in your market.
[00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:05.580]   Is that right?
[00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:06.580]   Yeah.
[00:39:06.580 --> 00:39:09.740]   It's a package that DirectTV has had for a long time and they pay a lot of money for
[00:39:09.740 --> 00:39:13.940]   it, basically, to drive people to get a satellite dish on their roof because it's the only way
[00:39:13.940 --> 00:39:16.380]   that you could get out of market NFL games.
[00:39:16.380 --> 00:39:17.380]   Out of market NFL games.
[00:39:17.380 --> 00:39:21.340]   It's a local team on a local channel, then you can't see it.
[00:39:21.340 --> 00:39:24.540]   If it's a national game, it's not on there, but it's every other game.
[00:39:24.540 --> 00:39:30.300]   If you're a Packers fan and they're playing the Buccaneers on a Sunday morning and you
[00:39:30.300 --> 00:39:32.460]   live in California, how do you see that game?
[00:39:32.460 --> 00:39:35.420]   The answer is NFL Sunday ticket.
[00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:41.260]   They use that to drive huge amounts of DirectTV installations, which was a really smart move
[00:39:41.260 --> 00:39:42.260]   for a long time.
[00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:49.700]   DirectTV spent a billion and a half for it, but they've been losing money on it big time.
[00:39:49.700 --> 00:39:50.700]   It is not good.
[00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:51.700]   They're not going to renew it.
[00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:56.420]   It's up next year and NFL says they want two and a half billion.
[00:39:56.420 --> 00:39:58.020]   They want a billion more this time.
[00:39:58.020 --> 00:40:01.580]   Yeah, it never really made sense from a financial, direct financial perspective.
[00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:04.700]   It made sense in the idea that they were doing customer acquisition.
[00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:07.860]   I think that it's gone by the wayside.
[00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:08.860]   Guess what?
[00:40:08.860 --> 00:40:12.780]   The NFL, rather than doing what they could do, which is a direct-to-consumer product,
[00:40:12.780 --> 00:40:17.860]   which they actually launched, or they announced last week, called NFL Plus, which is kind
[00:40:17.860 --> 00:40:21.620]   of not that interesting because it's only on phones.
[00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:24.500]   It's basically what Verizon and Pima Boli used to offer.
[00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:28.900]   This is so frustrating because I want to watch the games, right?
[00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:32.260]   I've got it on my phone, but I can't put it on my big screen TV.
[00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:33.820]   I don't understand.
[00:40:33.820 --> 00:40:39.620]   They carved this little part out of the Sunday ticket deal, which was this mobile only thing.
[00:40:39.620 --> 00:40:41.340]   That's NFL Plus now.
[00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:42.340]   They took it in-house.
[00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:46.460]   They're doing that because then that doesn't undermine whoever's going to buy a Sunday
[00:40:46.460 --> 00:40:47.460]   ticket.
[00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:48.460]   Exactly right.
[00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:52.500]   It would literally be Sunday ticket if it didn't have that limitation to it.
[00:40:52.500 --> 00:40:53.500]   They're starting that.
[00:40:53.500 --> 00:40:54.500]   Hey, and there's been rumors-
[00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:55.500]   Ask yourself the question why.
[00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:57.340]   There's been rumors you might be able to Chromecast it.
[00:40:57.340 --> 00:40:59.620]   You might be able to airplay it to your big screen TV.
[00:40:59.620 --> 00:41:01.340]   I'm sure there are workarounds.
[00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:04.460]   There are also workarounds where you change your DNS and you can get NFL Plus to show
[00:41:04.460 --> 00:41:06.900]   everything because it's their international product as well.
[00:41:06.900 --> 00:41:08.580]   People are not here to talk about that.
[00:41:08.580 --> 00:41:09.580]   I have friends who've done that.
[00:41:09.580 --> 00:41:14.780]   But when you met Silly, it's last about six months start up where you had vertical video
[00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:16.580]   that was Hollywood's idea of-
[00:41:16.580 --> 00:41:17.420]   Quibi.
[00:41:17.420 --> 00:41:20.300]   TikTok, remember?
[00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:21.660]   And that was the flaw with Quibi.
[00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:23.660]   You couldn't put it on your screen.
[00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:24.660]   Right.
[00:41:24.660 --> 00:41:25.660]   Right.
[00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:29.700]   Whereas the NFL thinks that putting it on your screen for a whole football game is probably
[00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:31.100]   what you want to do.
[00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:34.740]   This is how I want to watch a football game just like this on my phone.
[00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:35.740]   Just like that.
[00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:36.740]   Just like you're there.
[00:41:36.740 --> 00:41:37.740]   That's so nutty.
[00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:38.740]   Right.
[00:41:38.740 --> 00:41:39.740]   I love it.
[00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:40.740]   There's the thing though.
[00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:41.740]   You do.
[00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:42.740]   Do you like-
[00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:43.740]   I get such a kick out of it.
[00:41:43.740 --> 00:41:44.740]   It's the same reason I like the Snapchat hot dog.
[00:41:44.740 --> 00:41:45.740]   It doesn't make any sense.
[00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:46.740]   It makes sense.
[00:41:46.740 --> 00:41:47.740]   It's greed.
[00:41:47.740 --> 00:41:48.740]   It's money, money, money, money, money.
[00:41:48.740 --> 00:41:49.740]   That's why-
[00:41:49.740 --> 00:41:50.740]   Why?
[00:41:50.740 --> 00:41:51.740]   Because here's the thing.
[00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:58.100]   They could make it in FL+ the replacement for Sunday ticket and sell direct and they
[00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:02.420]   would get the money from their customers directly, which is actually pretty good.
[00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:03.420]   They make more money.
[00:42:03.420 --> 00:42:04.420]   So why don't they?
[00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:09.620]   The answer is because somebody will pay them more than it's worth because of extenuating
[00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:12.220]   circumstances because they want to build out something else.
[00:42:12.220 --> 00:42:13.220]   Like DirectTV did it.
[00:42:13.220 --> 00:42:15.700]   So who's up next?
[00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:21.860]   Well, it's Apple and Amazon because they are making video ecosystem plays that don't have
[00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:28.860]   to make direct financial sense because they want to get people to use Apple TV+ or use
[00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:29.860]   prime video.
[00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:33.020]   According to the New York Times.
[00:42:33.020 --> 00:42:34.380]   Add one more to the mix.
[00:42:34.380 --> 00:42:38.860]   Who else is as big as Apple and Amazon and has other reasons they might want YouTube?
[00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:39.860]   YouTube, sure.
[00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:45.060]   Apparently, YouTube now is going to be the third party trying to buy these two and a
[00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:49.300]   half billion dollar rights to the NFL Sunday ticket.
[00:42:49.300 --> 00:42:51.940]   And by the way, Apple's already started to buy.
[00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:53.700]   They have Major League Soccer.
[00:42:53.700 --> 00:42:56.100]   They have Friday night baseball.
[00:42:56.100 --> 00:42:57.100]   Apple sees this.
[00:42:57.100 --> 00:42:58.380]   And is it what you were saying?
[00:42:58.380 --> 00:42:59.940]   Because you obviously cover this.
[00:42:59.940 --> 00:43:02.420]   And they're rumored to do college football too.
[00:43:02.420 --> 00:43:03.420]   Yeah.
[00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:07.180]   If you're going to watch live sports, you got to have that package.
[00:43:07.180 --> 00:43:08.340]   There's no other way to do it.
[00:43:08.340 --> 00:43:09.340]   Yeah.
[00:43:09.340 --> 00:43:12.780]   If you're a fan of anything that is on a particular service, you're going to be motivated to get
[00:43:12.780 --> 00:43:13.780]   that service.
[00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:18.340]   And that has value beyond the monetary value.
[00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:22.980]   If you're Apple and why do you get Friday night baseball or why do you get the MLS?
[00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:26.380]   One of the reasons is maybe people will convert and they'll pay.
[00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:28.060]   They're still giving away Friday night baseball.
[00:43:28.060 --> 00:43:29.860]   They're not even charging for it yet.
[00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:35.180]   But what you are doing is increasing the number of people who know how to get Apple TV+ onto
[00:43:35.180 --> 00:43:36.700]   their TV.
[00:43:36.700 --> 00:43:41.220]   And once you do that, the next step is you try to convince them to, you know, you're in
[00:43:41.220 --> 00:43:42.220]   the ecosystem now.
[00:43:42.220 --> 00:43:45.500]   You convince them to watch Ted Lasso or you convince them to watch Severance or whatever
[00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:46.500]   it is.
[00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:47.500]   Right?
[00:43:47.500 --> 00:43:49.580]   So they've got this ulterior kind of ecosystem motive.
[00:43:49.580 --> 00:43:50.860]   Amazon is similar.
[00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:52.340]   YouTube would be similar.
[00:43:52.340 --> 00:43:56.580]   And for the NFL, you're like, well, we could build this great direct to consumer business.
[00:43:56.580 --> 00:43:58.060]   And it would make sense in the long run.
[00:43:58.060 --> 00:43:59.980]   And I think in the long run, they will do it.
[00:43:59.980 --> 00:44:04.380]   But it's very hard to say no if somebody's going to give you an extra billion dollars
[00:44:04.380 --> 00:44:05.980]   for to be the middleman.
[00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:06.980]   Right?
[00:44:06.980 --> 00:44:08.460]   It's like, okay, great.
[00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:09.460]   Let's do it.
[00:44:09.460 --> 00:44:10.700]   And so that's what's going on now.
[00:44:10.700 --> 00:44:12.740]   I mentioned college football.
[00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:15.060]   The all the college football rights are churning around right now too.
[00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:16.900]   A bunch of them are coming up.
[00:44:16.900 --> 00:44:21.740]   And although ESPN and Fox are the big players there, that's another case where there are
[00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:26.780]   these ecosystem companies, especially like Apple and Amazon, who are interested in being
[00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:27.780]   a part of that.
[00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:33.300]   Because again, live sports is something that you can't cycle through and then binge in
[00:44:33.300 --> 00:44:34.300]   a hurry.
[00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:36.820]   And you're paying over the course of months and months and months.
[00:44:36.820 --> 00:44:40.100]   See, Amazon's, by the way, Amazon's got the NFL now too on Thursday nights.
[00:44:40.100 --> 00:44:41.100]   That's right.
[00:44:41.100 --> 00:44:42.100]   Exclusive for the next time.
[00:44:42.100 --> 00:44:43.100]   Did that go through?
[00:44:43.100 --> 00:44:44.100]   Oh, yeah.
[00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:45.100]   It is.
[00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:46.100]   It's exclusive.
[00:44:46.100 --> 00:44:47.100]   It's going to have Al Michaels.
[00:44:47.100 --> 00:44:48.100]   They hired Al Michaels.
[00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:49.100]   They got Al Michaels.
[00:44:49.100 --> 00:44:50.820]   Part of the problem was finding a partner for Al Michaels that he would want to broadcast
[00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:51.820]   with.
[00:44:51.820 --> 00:44:52.820]   Right.
[00:44:52.820 --> 00:44:53.820]   Who did they find?
[00:44:53.820 --> 00:44:54.820]   Did they finally get to get it?
[00:44:54.820 --> 00:44:55.820]   Oh, I forget.
[00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:56.820]   It's no lightweight.
[00:44:56.820 --> 00:44:57.820]   I mean, it's an impret.
[00:44:57.820 --> 00:44:58.820]   They spent a lot of money on an answer.
[00:44:58.820 --> 00:44:59.820]   I'm probably serious.
[00:44:59.820 --> 00:45:00.820]   So they like that.
[00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:03.660]   Because they want, they want to be taken seriously.
[00:45:03.660 --> 00:45:05.660]   But this is, this is the next bad.
[00:45:05.660 --> 00:45:08.820]   Does this mean I have to stream Thursday nights football?
[00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:09.820]   I can't watch it.
[00:45:09.820 --> 00:45:10.820]   Yes.
[00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:14.860]   Actually, the NFL is the best at this of anybody because they have a standing policy
[00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:19.220]   that if it's your local team, it has to be on broadcast TV in your local market.
[00:45:19.220 --> 00:45:23.580]   So if you're a 49er fan and the game's on Amazon on Thursday, it'll be on one of the
[00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:25.740]   local channels in San Francisco.
[00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:29.860]   If you're out of that market, you will need to watch it on Amazon Prime Video.
[00:45:29.860 --> 00:45:30.860]   And it's, there it is.
[00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:31.860]   Kirk Herb Street.
[00:45:31.860 --> 00:45:32.860]   It's Kirk Herb Street.
[00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:33.860]   Well, now.
[00:45:33.860 --> 00:45:36.860]   He is well known in college football circles.
[00:45:36.860 --> 00:45:37.860]   I don't know.
[00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:38.860]   NFL circles.
[00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:40.860]   But he's not a random dude.
[00:45:40.860 --> 00:45:42.940]   He's saying, "Am I not random dude?"
[00:45:42.940 --> 00:45:43.940]   Yeah.
[00:45:43.940 --> 00:45:44.940]   Sounds like a random dude.
[00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:45.940]   I'm wondering.
[00:45:45.940 --> 00:45:46.940]   Shit.
[00:45:46.940 --> 00:45:47.940]   Sports ball.
[00:45:47.940 --> 00:45:48.940]   I'm not.
[00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:49.940]   It's random to me.
[00:45:49.940 --> 00:45:50.940]   Yeah.
[00:45:50.940 --> 00:45:53.700]   And Thursday night, last season was on two different places.
[00:45:53.700 --> 00:45:54.860]   So it was very confusing.
[00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:55.860]   You didn't know why.
[00:45:55.860 --> 00:45:56.860]   They simulcast.
[00:45:56.860 --> 00:45:57.860]   Yeah.
[00:45:57.860 --> 00:45:58.860]   And they simulcast it, right?
[00:45:58.860 --> 00:46:00.700]   Because they didn't want to fully commit to being on streaming, but they are now.
[00:46:00.700 --> 00:46:01.860]   So this is just, I mean, this is.
[00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:05.860]   Well, it's huge for a cold rush for Kirk Herb Street fans, I think.
[00:46:05.860 --> 00:46:06.860]   It's a big.
[00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:12.100]   And I have to say, Shoshana, if Nathan's decided to stream the hot dog eating contest, I think
[00:46:12.100 --> 00:46:13.420]   you might want to.
[00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:14.420]   Those rights are coming up.
[00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:15.420]   Get those rights.
[00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:19.060]   A lot of speculation about would you, would you have to sign up for us?
[00:46:19.060 --> 00:46:20.860]   I think ESPN is going to lock down the hot dog.
[00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:21.860]   I'm sorry.
[00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:22.860]   I wonder.
[00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:25.620]   I wonder how sports bars handle this.
[00:46:25.620 --> 00:46:27.580]   I mean, just the New York City.
[00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:28.580]   This is like.
[00:46:28.580 --> 00:46:29.580]   It's just pirated, right?
[00:46:29.580 --> 00:46:30.580]   Yeah.
[00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:32.580]   No, no, it's a big deal.
[00:46:32.580 --> 00:46:34.500]   There's a pay-per-view, right?
[00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:37.340]   What I have heard, the reports are actually that they are separating because right now
[00:46:37.340 --> 00:46:40.580]   it's Sunday ticket branded for all of it and it's direct TV.
[00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:43.980]   Is the pay-direct TV almost $300 a season for that?
[00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:44.980]   It's expensive.
[00:46:44.980 --> 00:46:48.900]   The reports, the reports are that for for bars and restaurants and other places like
[00:46:48.900 --> 00:46:54.180]   that, they're separating that package because they know that the last thing that a bar,
[00:46:54.180 --> 00:46:58.900]   a bar does not have enough internet to stream eight different games at once, right?
[00:46:58.900 --> 00:46:59.900]   It doesn't.
[00:46:59.900 --> 00:47:00.900]   It would be kind of what I wonder.
[00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:06.500]   You have to be IT people at your bar to manage these streams and do you have to?
[00:47:06.500 --> 00:47:10.900]   I mean, that's kind of the question my mind goes to and it's huge business.
[00:47:10.900 --> 00:47:11.900]   Shashana.
[00:47:11.900 --> 00:47:14.820]   I guess that probably still will stay on a satellite, but it'll be like you'll get the
[00:47:14.820 --> 00:47:21.340]   box from the NFL that decrypts multiple streams and puts them on TVs and Apple.
[00:47:21.340 --> 00:47:24.900]   You won't have to like hook up eight Apple TVs to watch football on a bar.
[00:47:24.900 --> 00:47:25.900]   Oh my God.
[00:47:25.900 --> 00:47:26.900]   Yeah.
[00:47:26.900 --> 00:47:27.900]   Let's hope.
[00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:28.900]   What's your sport?
[00:47:28.900 --> 00:47:29.900]   Yeah.
[00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:32.300]   I don't do sports.
[00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:38.700]   I just don't sports, but I will say there's two little things I have for this.
[00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:43.140]   And one is that like years ago, I think it was the NFL crack down on people sharing gifts
[00:47:43.140 --> 00:47:44.380]   of their stuff like.
[00:47:44.380 --> 00:47:45.380]   Yeah.
[00:47:45.380 --> 00:47:46.380]   Isn't that absurd?
[00:47:46.380 --> 00:47:47.380]   Yeah.
[00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:48.380]   Right.
[00:47:48.380 --> 00:47:51.780]   And I don't think they know how how benefits for them work.
[00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:53.420]   Like it's no, no one's like, Oh, here's the gift.
[00:47:53.420 --> 00:47:55.580]   You know, like I'm going to just not watch the game now.
[00:47:55.580 --> 00:47:56.580]   Right.
[00:47:56.580 --> 00:47:57.580]   What do I need that for?
[00:47:57.580 --> 00:47:58.580]   Yeah.
[00:47:58.580 --> 00:47:59.580]   Right.
[00:47:59.580 --> 00:48:01.700]   And I don't trust them not to mis-manage it because of this.
[00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:05.780]   I feel like they're really bad at seeing the forest through the trees.
[00:48:05.780 --> 00:48:12.540]   And also one thing that I kind of don't understand just as a nerd who's not a sports person.
[00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:14.580]   I watch Turner Classic movies a lot.
[00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:15.580]   Me too.
[00:48:15.580 --> 00:48:16.580]   And I love TCM.
[00:48:16.580 --> 00:48:17.580]   Yes.
[00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:18.860]   But you have to buy it with a sports package now.
[00:48:18.860 --> 00:48:22.660]   And I'm like, well, don't, you know, why would you need extra incentive to buy sports?
[00:48:22.660 --> 00:48:24.260]   That does seem mutually exclusive.
[00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:26.260]   Well, exclusive audiences.
[00:48:26.260 --> 00:48:28.940]   Cast, cash, grab is what that is.
[00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:29.940]   That's the cash.
[00:48:29.940 --> 00:48:30.940]   They own TCM.
[00:48:30.940 --> 00:48:31.940]   They own Turner.
[00:48:31.940 --> 00:48:33.540]   Oh, it's they bought all of that with Warren.
[00:48:33.540 --> 00:48:36.700]   No, but they, what they did is they put it on the same tier as their sports stuff as
[00:48:36.700 --> 00:48:38.780]   the entertainment package or something like that.
[00:48:38.780 --> 00:48:42.940]   And the idea there is basically they're forcing people who like TCM to give them extra.
[00:48:42.940 --> 00:48:47.340]   I don't know what it is, $5 a month by putting it in a plan and all them, all my movie fan
[00:48:47.340 --> 00:48:49.020]   friends who don't like sports.
[00:48:49.020 --> 00:48:50.020]   So annoying.
[00:48:50.020 --> 00:48:51.020]   What?
[00:48:51.020 --> 00:48:52.020]   So annoying.
[00:48:52.020 --> 00:48:57.980]   I think the NFL were visionaries because what are they doing now?
[00:48:57.980 --> 00:49:01.420]   Officially licensed NFL video NFTs.
[00:49:01.420 --> 00:49:03.340]   Oh my gosh.
[00:49:03.340 --> 00:49:05.180]   Like, I don't know.
[00:49:05.180 --> 00:49:09.580]   I know web three has its uses, but a lot of times I feel like this just, this just feels
[00:49:09.580 --> 00:49:10.580]   like a scam to me.
[00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:12.140]   Like this just feels like a scam.
[00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:13.140]   It is.
[00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:18.980]   They looked at the NBA and they said, look at all the money the NBA made on their NFTs.
[00:49:18.980 --> 00:49:27.580]   $65,000 if you want to get a legendary, legendary moment.
[00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:30.540]   That's a, okay, Patrick Mahomes.
[00:49:30.540 --> 00:49:33.460]   Wait a minute.
[00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:37.960]   Legendary number 56 is $9,000 is the lowest ask.
[00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:40.460]   This is cray cray.
[00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:44.420]   Now people who buy this are not because they're big Mahomes fans.
[00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:50.340]   They buy this because they think it's $9,000 now, but it's going to be $20,000 soon.
[00:49:50.340 --> 00:49:51.340]   Right?
[00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:52.340]   And this is speculation.
[00:49:52.340 --> 00:49:56.020]   Do you think they brag to their friends that they have this?
[00:49:56.020 --> 00:49:59.780]   Like, do you think that the people who buy this are like, Oh, bro, like check out what
[00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:00.780]   I just got.
[00:50:00.780 --> 00:50:03.500]   And like, also, do you think anyone's impressed by it?
[00:50:03.500 --> 00:50:04.500]   Like, I'm wondering.
[00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:05.900]   Nobody is impressed.
[00:50:05.900 --> 00:50:06.900]   Nobody is.
[00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:08.900]   Don't go in a bar.
[00:50:08.900 --> 00:50:09.900]   I say, I know.
[00:50:09.900 --> 00:50:10.900]   Yeah.
[00:50:10.900 --> 00:50:11.900]   Oh, God.
[00:50:11.900 --> 00:50:14.980]   I'm a PC juniors and those Todd McFarland Spider-Man number ones.
[00:50:14.980 --> 00:50:21.180]   It's a speculation by the time everybody's speculating, it's over.
[00:50:21.180 --> 00:50:23.900]   The NBA is selling it like baseball cards, right?
[00:50:23.900 --> 00:50:28.100]   In fact, they have here's the top shot starter pack.
[00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:32.900]   Get your first NBA and WNBA digital collectors collectibles.
[00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:37.060]   See you buy the pack like like bubblegum cards, but you don't get bubblegum.
[00:50:37.060 --> 00:50:39.100]   You don't even get cards.
[00:50:39.100 --> 00:50:40.100]   You get a link.
[00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:41.100]   Nope.
[00:50:41.100 --> 00:50:42.100]   Please.
[00:50:42.100 --> 00:50:43.100]   The P.J.
[00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:46.060]   Andy.com is the baseball version of that.
[00:50:46.060 --> 00:50:47.900]   They all are doing it now.
[00:50:47.900 --> 00:50:50.220]   Unbelievable.
[00:50:50.220 --> 00:50:55.260]   When we just passed on this story, like, it just feels like a scam.
[00:50:55.260 --> 00:51:01.100]   They, I mean, the rage, I've never seen such unprofessional rage from their PR team.
[00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:04.460]   Oh, so the NBA contacted you at CBS.
[00:51:04.460 --> 00:51:07.500]   No, the NBA top shots, the NFT company.
[00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:08.500]   Oh.
[00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:09.500]   And we passed on it.
[00:51:09.500 --> 00:51:12.700]   It just, it was like, but it's it, but it's the NBA, isn't it?
[00:51:12.700 --> 00:51:14.780]   I mean, they're not.
[00:51:14.780 --> 00:51:15.780]   Are they in company?
[00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:17.900]   Yeah, they're all on partners.
[00:51:17.900 --> 00:51:18.900]   Yeah.
[00:51:18.900 --> 00:51:20.900]   Yeah, with an NFT company.
[00:51:20.900 --> 00:51:21.900]   Yeah.
[00:51:21.900 --> 00:51:24.780]   It's like, it's like the NFL saying, well, we'll give you a billion dollars to be the
[00:51:24.780 --> 00:51:25.780]   middleman.
[00:51:25.780 --> 00:51:29.940]   It's also like all these sports have said, oh, there's some tech startup that's going
[00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:33.180]   to give us a lot of money to license this stuff and do their NFT things.
[00:51:33.180 --> 00:51:34.180]   All right.
[00:51:34.180 --> 00:51:35.180]   Give us the money.
[00:51:35.180 --> 00:51:36.180]   Right.
[00:51:36.180 --> 00:51:37.180]   That's all they really care about.
[00:51:37.180 --> 00:51:39.180]   Do you think like in five years, and have some NFTs?
[00:51:39.180 --> 00:51:43.060]   Like beanie babies that will like just look back and then say what was going on?
[00:51:43.060 --> 00:51:44.620]   What were we smoking?
[00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:45.620]   Yeah.
[00:51:45.620 --> 00:51:47.380]   I think we'll care a lot more about those topic.
[00:51:47.380 --> 00:51:49.900]   Farland number one that Jason keeps talking about.
[00:51:49.900 --> 00:51:50.900]   For sure.
[00:51:50.900 --> 00:51:51.900]   I'm an easy junior.
[00:51:51.900 --> 00:51:57.180]   I mean, look, there's, we could talk about this all day and all night, but I mean, the
[00:51:57.180 --> 00:52:02.780]   there is, there is the line go up principle here and really with, with NFTs and particularly
[00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:08.340]   crypto as we all, well, I don't know if we all know this, but I mean, in order for you
[00:52:08.340 --> 00:52:12.220]   to get any value out, somebody else has to put cash in.
[00:52:12.220 --> 00:52:15.260]   That is fundamentally the way these products work.
[00:52:15.260 --> 00:52:16.260]   They're not technologies.
[00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:21.980]   The blockchain is a technology, but NFTs and cryptocurrency and play during games, those
[00:52:21.980 --> 00:52:23.140]   are products.
[00:52:23.140 --> 00:52:28.620]   And in order for any of these engines to work, money has to go in.
[00:52:28.620 --> 00:52:31.340]   So for money to come out, money has to go in.
[00:52:31.340 --> 00:52:33.660]   And I mean, like you can call it a Ponzi.
[00:52:33.660 --> 00:52:35.580]   You can call it a pyramid.
[00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:37.940]   Call it what you want.
[00:52:37.940 --> 00:52:42.420]   In order for this to function, somebody has to lose for you to win.
[00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:47.540]   You know, it's so anyway, I could go on and on, but like, I will stop.
[00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:52.940]   I'd kind of like to hear more about how unprofessional they were to you, but it sounds like you
[00:52:52.940 --> 00:52:54.940]   have a fun story there.
[00:52:54.940 --> 00:52:59.660]   How dare CVS not cover top shots.
[00:52:59.660 --> 00:53:01.700]   Don't you know what future?
[00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:03.660]   Yeah, a little bit.
[00:53:03.660 --> 00:53:13.140]   I mean, there is a particular posture that a number of crypto zealots adopt and they chose
[00:53:13.140 --> 00:53:19.100]   to adopt this posture, which was to be enticing and warm and try to get you to cover something.
[00:53:19.100 --> 00:53:23.340]   And when you pass, most other PR agencies know, okay, yes, you're super busy.
[00:53:23.340 --> 00:53:24.340]   You get stuff going on.
[00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:25.340]   Don't worry.
[00:53:25.340 --> 00:53:27.020]   We'll talk the next time we have a story.
[00:53:27.020 --> 00:53:29.220]   That's just the way it functions.
[00:53:29.220 --> 00:53:35.820]   And their posture was to get very, I mean, they use swear words and they tried to go
[00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:40.020]   over my head to my editor who was also like very eye rolling.
[00:53:40.020 --> 00:53:45.300]   They tried to go to a different department and to get a story on the air.
[00:53:45.300 --> 00:53:48.260]   And I mean, like, look, it's a small company.
[00:53:48.260 --> 00:53:52.660]   We all talk to each other and we generally have a similar editorial policy.
[00:53:52.660 --> 00:53:57.700]   And it when you start behaving like that, word goes out.
[00:53:57.700 --> 00:54:02.780]   And I mean, we might have covered them a couple months later, but through a different PR agency,
[00:54:02.780 --> 00:54:05.940]   it was just a very aggressive posture.
[00:54:05.940 --> 00:54:09.380]   And it was one that is not unfamiliar.
[00:54:09.380 --> 00:54:13.500]   If you've covered the crypto space, I think anybody, any reporter who's covered the crypto
[00:54:13.500 --> 00:54:20.340]   space has probably encountered PR agencies that only cover only rep crypto and behave
[00:54:20.340 --> 00:54:21.340]   like this.
[00:54:21.340 --> 00:54:22.340]   I don't think it's a coincidence.
[00:54:22.340 --> 00:54:23.780]   It's also the same behavior.
[00:54:23.780 --> 00:54:29.460]   Rumors and abusers use, they love bomb you until you reject them.
[00:54:29.460 --> 00:54:34.660]   And then they scream and if you're unlucky, hurt you.
[00:54:34.660 --> 00:54:38.700]   Boy, I hadn't thought of it like that, but it was really, really, really, and then getting
[00:54:38.700 --> 00:54:41.220]   very upset when you don't cover them the way they expect to be covered.
[00:54:41.220 --> 00:54:43.340]   It's the same mentality.
[00:54:43.340 --> 00:54:50.900]   If you ask me, the more I see and hear about NFTs and Web3, the less I like it.
[00:54:50.900 --> 00:54:56.860]   I keep trying to take the point of view, oh, it's an interesting technology.
[00:54:56.860 --> 00:55:03.540]   There may be something in it, but boy, the people involved do not impress.
[00:55:03.540 --> 00:55:05.380]   It's like micro dosing.
[00:55:05.380 --> 00:55:10.540]   Like I think micro dosing is a thing that can have its uses that I'm sure like for certain
[00:55:10.540 --> 00:55:12.980]   people work, smell like in a medical setting.
[00:55:12.980 --> 00:55:18.140]   But anyone you know who micro doses or talks about it, like just completely makes an illegitimate
[00:55:18.140 --> 00:55:19.140]   you know.
[00:55:19.140 --> 00:55:24.260]   One of my good friends who is a micro doser has lately been talking a lot about Web3 and
[00:55:24.260 --> 00:55:25.260]   NFTs.
[00:55:25.260 --> 00:55:28.140]   So you may not be far off.
[00:55:28.140 --> 00:55:31.860]   I'm speaking a little out of school, but we had a company come to us that wanted to,
[00:55:31.860 --> 00:55:34.900]   that was doing ketamine and they wanted to do ads.
[00:55:34.900 --> 00:55:35.900]   And I said, I'm not good.
[00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:36.900]   I'm sorry.
[00:55:36.900 --> 00:55:37.980]   I'm not going to do ads for ketamine.
[00:55:37.980 --> 00:55:40.140]   And they got very upset.
[00:55:40.140 --> 00:55:41.820]   Like why wouldn't you?
[00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:44.660]   Well, because it's not legal in most states.
[00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:48.260]   Why don't why do you mean why wouldn't I?
[00:55:48.260 --> 00:55:51.380]   There's something going on, isn't there?
[00:55:51.380 --> 00:55:56.540]   And you know, I think back to the Super Bowl, remember that Larry David ad where was it
[00:55:56.540 --> 00:56:01.700]   FTX or it was one of the binance was one of the crypto companies.
[00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:07.540]   And the whole idea was Larry David is this boomer, somebody my age who just doesn't get
[00:56:07.540 --> 00:56:08.540]   it.
[00:56:08.540 --> 00:56:12.340]   And he didn't like the wheel and he didn't like toilets and he doesn't like Bitcoin,
[00:56:12.340 --> 00:56:15.420]   you know, that's just they don't get it.
[00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:21.340]   And I find that kind of offensive because I think I do get it and that's a problem.
[00:56:21.340 --> 00:56:22.340]   It's like do get it.
[00:56:22.340 --> 00:56:24.100]   It's a pretty manipulative.
[00:56:24.100 --> 00:56:25.100]   It is.
[00:56:25.100 --> 00:56:27.900]   It feels very manipulative.
[00:56:27.900 --> 00:56:31.700]   I think that's I never put two and two together until you said that.
[00:56:31.700 --> 00:56:34.940]   No, but that's what scammers always do.
[00:56:34.940 --> 00:56:36.700]   I mean, that's essentially it.
[00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:37.700]   Right.
[00:56:37.700 --> 00:56:38.700]   But QAnon did too.
[00:56:38.700 --> 00:56:42.580]   I mean, they would they would use those exact same tactics love on you and then try to entice
[00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:44.260]   you when you wouldn't get into it.
[00:56:44.260 --> 00:56:45.860]   Like strong the capital.
[00:56:45.860 --> 00:56:46.860]   Yeah.
[00:56:46.860 --> 00:56:48.220]   But there you go.
[00:56:48.220 --> 00:56:51.700]   We all who hasn't after all.
[00:56:51.700 --> 00:56:52.700]   Wow.
[00:56:52.700 --> 00:56:53.700]   Okay.
[00:56:53.700 --> 00:56:56.700]   Let's see earnings Spotify.
[00:56:56.700 --> 00:57:01.100]   188 million premium users.
[00:57:01.100 --> 00:57:02.580]   That's good.
[00:57:02.580 --> 00:57:06.780]   Losing $197 million in the quarter.
[00:57:06.780 --> 00:57:08.780]   That's bad.
[00:57:08.780 --> 00:57:12.420]   Overall, it is it is tough to come.
[00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:14.300]   I mean, so there Spotify is number one.
[00:57:14.300 --> 00:57:15.300]   I assume.
[00:57:15.300 --> 00:57:16.300]   Oh, yeah.
[00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:17.300]   Oh, for sure.
[00:57:17.300 --> 00:57:18.300]   And competes.
[00:57:18.300 --> 00:57:19.300]   But it competes with Apple.
[00:57:19.300 --> 00:57:21.620]   And this is one of those examples of competing with a tech giant who's got an ecosystem play
[00:57:21.620 --> 00:57:25.620]   when you are a company dedicated to that thing is it's tough, right?
[00:57:25.620 --> 00:57:30.260]   Like, because Spotify has to compete with Apple and Apple doesn't have to compete with
[00:57:30.260 --> 00:57:31.260]   Spotify.
[00:57:31.260 --> 00:57:34.580]   Apple can just Apple can lose money.
[00:57:34.580 --> 00:57:39.300]   Apple could lose money like Spotify loses money until the sun blacks out and it would
[00:57:39.300 --> 00:57:40.300]   be fine, right?
[00:57:40.300 --> 00:57:43.260]   Like it would be it could just keep doing that.
[00:57:43.260 --> 00:57:47.420]   And I just it strikes me that Spotify has to make a business at this and bless them because
[00:57:47.420 --> 00:57:50.100]   you know, they are an independent business and this is what they're doing.
[00:57:50.100 --> 00:57:56.420]   But it just every time I see this, I think how rough it must be to have your closest competition
[00:57:56.420 --> 00:58:04.100]   be a company that is a minor cog in a giant tech giant and that they, you know, that
[00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:09.380]   you have to prove something to your investors and you know, does Apple music get called?
[00:58:09.380 --> 00:58:11.420]   They don't even reveal Apple music stats.
[00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:12.420]   They just don't care.
[00:58:12.420 --> 00:58:16.740]   And Spotify has to has to do this every quarter and go through this.
[00:58:16.740 --> 00:58:17.740]   That's great.
[00:58:17.740 --> 00:58:21.420]   Really related to that streaming story, which is it's hard for people who compete based
[00:58:21.420 --> 00:58:24.740]   on revenue from subscribers to compete with people who don't care.
[00:58:24.740 --> 00:58:29.060]   Well, Netflix and HBO Max and all those are entertainment companies, right?
[00:58:29.060 --> 00:58:32.220]   And then Apple and Amazon are not playing that game at all.
[00:58:32.220 --> 00:58:33.580]   They just are not playing.
[00:58:33.580 --> 00:58:34.580]   It's a totally different game.
[00:58:34.580 --> 00:58:35.580]   The money is different.
[00:58:35.580 --> 00:58:36.580]   The reasons are different.
[00:58:36.580 --> 00:58:37.580]   I don't know if you do about that.
[00:58:37.580 --> 00:58:38.580]   Yeah.
[00:58:38.580 --> 00:58:43.300]   I mean, you can't regulate that, but it does feel unfair.
[00:58:43.300 --> 00:58:45.820]   It feels like an uneven playing field.
[00:58:45.820 --> 00:58:48.100]   Yeah, that's a tough one.
[00:58:48.100 --> 00:58:52.660]   I mean, you could make arguments about like, well, if various mergers had not been approved
[00:58:52.660 --> 00:58:55.540]   and all that, but like Apple just, I mean, I guess they bought beats.
[00:58:55.540 --> 00:58:58.660]   So that technically they said, well, no, you can't buy beats, but they would have just
[00:58:58.660 --> 00:58:59.740]   made Apple music anyway.
[00:58:59.740 --> 00:59:04.740]   I've always thought Google shouldn't have been allowed to do YouTube, that Apple shouldn't
[00:59:04.740 --> 00:59:05.740]   be allowed.
[00:59:05.740 --> 00:59:07.580]   In other words, Apple shouldn't be a content company.
[00:59:07.580 --> 00:59:11.860]   It should be a hardware company that makes software too, maybe, but not a content company.
[00:59:11.860 --> 00:59:14.820]   YouTube should be a search company, not a content company.
[00:59:14.820 --> 00:59:20.700]   If you had those more clearly eliminated lines, Amazon should be an online retailer, not a
[00:59:20.700 --> 00:59:21.700]   streaming service.
[00:59:21.700 --> 00:59:25.420]   I mean, it's because those lines are blurred that you get them competing.
[00:59:25.420 --> 00:59:32.620]   I guess there is an antitrust idea here, a doctrine here, that that's what happens.
[00:59:32.620 --> 00:59:38.140]   If companies get really big, they get them anopoly in one area, they can become too powerful
[00:59:38.140 --> 00:59:41.220]   so that when they enter other areas, you can't compete against them.
[00:59:41.220 --> 00:59:43.940]   And I guess in a way, that's exactly what's happening, isn't it?
[00:59:43.940 --> 00:59:48.980]   I mean, the cart is left the barn is left, the horses left the cart or whatever, but I
[00:59:48.980 --> 00:59:51.900]   mean, there's no horses, no cart, there's no barn.
[00:59:51.900 --> 00:59:52.900]   It's over.
[00:59:52.900 --> 00:59:53.900]   Go ahead, Shashana.
[00:59:53.900 --> 00:59:57.380]   So I just push back because I don't think Google's gotten into the horse game yet.
[00:59:57.380 --> 00:59:58.380]   They might at some point.
[00:59:58.380 --> 01:00:02.300]   But when they got into the social media game, you know, they didn't do so for Google plus
[01:00:02.300 --> 01:00:04.980]   and I think you have to allow that to happen.
[01:00:04.980 --> 01:00:09.420]   I also do worry about companies that wouldn't want to start if they can't be acquired because
[01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:13.100]   with regulatory cliffs, you know, you reach a certain point and sometimes you don't want
[01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:17.780]   the scrutiny on you or you don't want to have to handle the scrutiny or whether regulatory
[01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:19.580]   or otherwise and being a business.
[01:00:19.580 --> 01:00:20.820]   Why couldn't they just be a business?
[01:00:20.820 --> 01:00:22.740]   Why do they have to have an exit?
[01:00:22.740 --> 01:00:24.980]   I don't know.
[01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:28.980]   The kind of regulations I've seen that kick in at certain levels, I'm sympathetic to that
[01:00:28.980 --> 01:00:29.980]   like compliance really does.
[01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:34.060]   It's so big that it's just too hard to do business without being absorbed by a bigger
[01:00:34.060 --> 01:00:35.060]   company.
[01:00:35.060 --> 01:00:36.060]   Yeah.
[01:00:36.060 --> 01:00:38.620]   And I think we should make sure that regulatory environment doesn't encourage that, that
[01:00:38.620 --> 01:00:42.420]   it doesn't, you know, encourage acquisition where it shouldn't have to.
[01:00:42.420 --> 01:00:46.820]   But so far as it exists this way, you know, but also I think these companies can fail
[01:00:46.820 --> 01:00:47.820]   on their own.
[01:00:47.820 --> 01:00:50.900]   There's a lot of companies that are great at something and think they'll be traded everything
[01:00:50.900 --> 01:00:52.940]   and then they suck or even a bunch of things.
[01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:54.100]   But here's the difference, Shashana.
[01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:58.380]   They can survive that failure in a way that a company like Spotify cannot.
[01:00:58.380 --> 01:01:01.420]   If Google failed in social, big deal.
[01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:04.260]   If Apple failed in streaming, big deal.
[01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:09.060]   But if Spotify fails in streaming or Meta fails in social, that is a big deal.
[01:01:09.060 --> 01:01:10.060]   So, oh yeah.
[01:01:10.060 --> 01:01:12.020]   But Meta's kind of one of these big guys.
[01:01:12.020 --> 01:01:18.140]   So maybe Meta can fail at, you know, at, you know, videos peer to peer video.
[01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:21.860]   Maybe they fail at that and keep social okay, but their social is not doing so great.
[01:01:21.860 --> 01:01:23.940]   So then if they fail at that, that's a bigger thing.
[01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:26.340]   So they all kind of have their bread and butter that they have to keep.
[01:01:26.340 --> 01:01:31.540]   Is it important that Spotify exists that it succeed?
[01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:32.540]   Isn't it?
[01:01:32.540 --> 01:01:35.500]   Doesn't, don't they provide competition?
[01:01:35.500 --> 01:01:40.220]   No more than any other company in my view, you know, it should come, sorry, loss should
[01:01:40.220 --> 01:01:43.820]   support competition, but not specific competitors.
[01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:47.060]   So as long as there's competitors, there's ability for people to jump in.
[01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:49.140]   There's, you know, real opportunity.
[01:01:49.140 --> 01:01:50.140]   It's fine.
[01:01:50.140 --> 01:01:51.140]   I know I'm like on the outskirts.
[01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:52.140]   I do Pandora still.
[01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:54.340]   I just don't want to have to switch over all myself.
[01:01:54.340 --> 01:01:56.340]   That's a perfect example.
[01:01:56.340 --> 01:01:58.940]   Pandora crushed by the record companies.
[01:01:58.940 --> 01:02:00.820]   Absolutely crushed.
[01:02:00.820 --> 01:02:04.860]   Spotify was about to be crushed by the record companies because they only can make money
[01:02:04.860 --> 01:02:07.340]   if the record companies allow it.
[01:02:07.340 --> 01:02:10.500]   And the record companies, you know, have a little faucet, little tiny teeny faucet that
[01:02:10.500 --> 01:02:14.220]   they turn on a little drip at a time.
[01:02:14.220 --> 01:02:17.340]   But at any point they could say, yeah, we're going to charge you 15 cents a stream.
[01:02:17.340 --> 01:02:18.660]   Bye bye.
[01:02:18.660 --> 01:02:20.020]   So what does Spotify do?
[01:02:20.020 --> 01:02:23.980]   As any sensible company did, they invested heavily in podcasts and audiobooks and stuff
[01:02:23.980 --> 01:02:26.420]   that the record companies don't control.
[01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:28.220]   That hasn't kicked in yet.
[01:02:28.220 --> 01:02:30.580]   So Spotify is, I think, very vulnerable.
[01:02:30.580 --> 01:02:35.780]   I mean, the fact that they have 433 million users, 180 million subscribers, and they're
[01:02:35.780 --> 01:02:39.220]   still losing $197 million a quarter.
[01:02:39.220 --> 01:02:40.220]   That tells you something.
[01:02:40.220 --> 01:02:44.580]   Well, when their investors lose faith, then somebody will buy them out, right?
[01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:49.900]   So that's the really the death sentence for Spotify would be they get bought out because
[01:02:49.900 --> 01:02:54.700]   they, you know, their business is falling apart and their investors are trying to exit.
[01:02:54.700 --> 01:02:56.340]   They're headed for the exits.
[01:02:56.340 --> 01:03:01.660]   And, you know, but I brought them up and their competition just to say, you know, I don't
[01:03:01.660 --> 01:03:02.940]   I don't love Daniel Eck.
[01:03:02.940 --> 01:03:03.940]   It's spot Spotify.
[01:03:03.940 --> 01:03:08.060]   I mean, you know, he said a bunch of stuff that I think is questionable and self-serving
[01:03:08.060 --> 01:03:09.540]   and makes him look like a champion.
[01:03:09.540 --> 01:03:10.540]   And easily not.
[01:03:10.540 --> 01:03:12.220]   But enemy of podcasts to be honest.
[01:03:12.220 --> 01:03:13.220]   Yeah.
[01:03:13.220 --> 01:03:14.220]   Yeah.
[01:03:14.220 --> 01:03:15.220]   Yeah.
[01:03:15.220 --> 01:03:16.220]   Yeah.
[01:03:16.220 --> 01:03:17.220]   Yeah.
[01:03:17.220 --> 01:03:22.380]   So I have gone it alone against tech giants because everybody's got their own music service.
[01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:26.300]   Amazon's got one and Google's got one and Apple's got one, right?
[01:03:26.300 --> 01:03:28.100]   Google's got two or they did have two.
[01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:29.100]   Now they have one again.
[01:03:29.100 --> 01:03:30.100]   I don't know.
[01:03:30.100 --> 01:03:34.980]   And they and they're number one, like I really admire that and they've gone their own way.
[01:03:34.980 --> 01:03:39.220]   What gives me pause is just I look at these losses and I think how long can they keep
[01:03:39.220 --> 01:03:45.020]   it up because I do like that they're the number one and they're independent and not
[01:03:45.020 --> 01:03:46.020]   one of the tech giants.
[01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:50.700]   Like for their world because they've created a better product and they have more users,
[01:03:50.700 --> 01:03:52.260]   they should be succeeding.
[01:03:52.260 --> 01:03:53.260]   Yes.
[01:03:53.260 --> 01:03:55.860]   But they aren't.
[01:03:55.860 --> 01:03:58.260]   So that seems unfair in some way to me.
[01:03:58.260 --> 01:03:59.860]   They're doing everything right.
[01:03:59.860 --> 01:04:03.900]   But because the record companies have a stranglehold on them, they can't succeed.
[01:04:03.900 --> 01:04:08.460]   To me, it kind of goes to the IP law, the record companies as well.
[01:04:08.460 --> 01:04:12.300]   You know, I'm not as well versed in that part of media law, but if there's issues there,
[01:04:12.300 --> 01:04:14.860]   it should be solved so that we can, you know, figure that out.
[01:04:14.860 --> 01:04:18.460]   Maybe you need a brand style licensing for music.
[01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:21.260]   You know, we have that in patents, right?
[01:04:21.260 --> 01:04:26.980]   Fair, fair, reasonable patent fees, license fees so that companies can't strangle other
[01:04:26.980 --> 01:04:29.140]   companies with their patents.
[01:04:29.140 --> 01:04:30.820]   Maybe we need something like that in music.
[01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:32.540]   You know, I want artists to get caught.
[01:04:32.540 --> 01:04:36.660]   You know, the problem isn't, by the way, artists, the problem is the record companies.
[01:04:36.660 --> 01:04:43.140]   As the middle man, they give the artist pennies and they take dollars from Spotify and who
[01:04:43.140 --> 01:04:45.500]   makes all the money that the middle man does.
[01:04:45.500 --> 01:04:48.820]   So the record companies have always been the villain in this story.
[01:04:48.820 --> 01:04:50.180]   Oh, and the publishers.
[01:04:50.180 --> 01:04:52.140]   I mean, it's not just the labels, right?
[01:04:52.140 --> 01:04:56.020]   I mean, it's the publishers that own the ASCAP, the M&C SAC.
[01:04:56.020 --> 01:04:57.020]   That's right.
[01:04:57.020 --> 01:04:58.020]   Right.
[01:04:58.020 --> 01:04:59.700]   So I mean, that's the labels, right.
[01:04:59.700 --> 01:05:03.940]   I mean, I totally agree with the behavior of the labels, especially over the last 25
[01:05:03.940 --> 01:05:10.020]   years, but they two are in a pinch and they are fighting for every last cent with the publishers.
[01:05:10.020 --> 01:05:11.020]   Right.
[01:05:11.020 --> 01:05:12.020]   Publishers, you're right.
[01:05:12.020 --> 01:05:15.620]   Those are your slash labels, but probably more publishers than anything else.
[01:05:15.620 --> 01:05:20.380]   Even though on Instagram, you'll see people will have background music for a video and
[01:05:20.380 --> 01:05:25.300]   then it'll get removed, you know, because for some reason they, you know, there's an
[01:05:25.300 --> 01:05:26.300]   understanding.
[01:05:26.300 --> 01:05:27.860]   Oh, it happens to us all the time on YouTube.
[01:05:27.860 --> 01:05:28.860]   Yeah, you get it.
[01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:32.180]   And it's not like people are going to be like, Oh man, let me tune into this podcast halfway
[01:05:32.180 --> 01:05:34.100]   through to listen to a quarter of a song.
[01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:35.100]   Now I don't need the song.
[01:05:35.100 --> 01:05:36.100]   Like that's not about.
[01:05:36.100 --> 01:05:40.880]   If I play 10 seconds of a song, YouTube immediately will either ding me or or often
[01:05:40.880 --> 01:05:43.540]   take it down.
[01:05:43.540 --> 01:05:45.360]   We showed it was a news story.
[01:05:45.360 --> 01:05:46.360]   We're a news organization.
[01:05:46.360 --> 01:05:47.360]   It's a fair use.
[01:05:47.360 --> 01:05:53.340]   It's covered, you know, when the queen celebrated her jubilee, we showed that very cute video
[01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:58.580]   of Pattington the bear having tea with Queen Elizabeth as part of that.
[01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:02.720]   The panning's in the bear people took down that podcast and it's still down.
[01:06:02.720 --> 01:06:05.640]   It'll never, it'll never be back up.
[01:06:05.640 --> 01:06:08.020]   And I don't think I undermine the rights of panning's in the bear.
[01:06:08.020 --> 01:06:10.920]   If anything, I made people like pannington more, right?
[01:06:10.920 --> 01:06:13.280]   Oh, that's nuts.
[01:06:13.280 --> 01:06:14.280]   It's like the NFL gift thing.
[01:06:14.280 --> 01:06:15.280]   The same idea.
[01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:17.560]   You're actually doing promotion for them.
[01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:19.560]   And they're like, Oh, no, not free promotion.
[01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:23.760]   It's like when you go to a museum and they say whatever you do, no Instagram pictures.
[01:06:23.760 --> 01:06:29.560]   It's like, dude, you should be so lucky that some influencer would decide that this is
[01:06:29.560 --> 01:06:33.880]   the perfect place for an instant because that would draw millions.
[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:35.720]   All right.
[01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:38.900]   Let's take a little one more Spotify story.
[01:06:38.900 --> 01:06:44.240]   Despite the fact they're losing all that money, they shelled out a lot of money to take over
[01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:51.620]   the podcast industry, $295 million for four companies, find away pod sites, chartable
[01:06:51.620 --> 01:06:53.780]   and sun antic.
[01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:57.180]   This is part of their quarterly earnings.
[01:06:57.180 --> 01:07:00.860]   They paid 83 million euros in cash for pod sites and chartable.
[01:07:00.860 --> 01:07:01.860]   Why?
[01:07:01.860 --> 01:07:09.280]   Because we use both of them that help podcasters monetize by telling advertisers how well their
[01:07:09.280 --> 01:07:10.620]   ads are working.
[01:07:10.620 --> 01:07:12.380]   Now Spotify owns them.
[01:07:12.380 --> 01:07:14.620]   In fact, chartable, immediately shut down.
[01:07:14.620 --> 01:07:17.740]   We were using chartable and it kind of put us in a bit bad position.
[01:07:17.740 --> 01:07:24.620]   Pod sites still is open, but only as long as Spotify decides not to squeeze the non-spotify
[01:07:24.620 --> 01:07:27.380]   podcast market.
[01:07:27.380 --> 01:07:31.420]   So Nantic is an interesting thing.
[01:07:31.420 --> 01:07:40.140]   The AI voice platform used to simulate Val Kilmer's voice in the recent Top Gun sequel.
[01:07:40.140 --> 01:07:46.900]   That's $91 million and then $117 million for Findaway, which is a digital audio book
[01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:47.900]   distributor.
[01:07:47.900 --> 01:07:52.060]   All this money is being spent essentially to give them a new business.
[01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:57.260]   Don't forget that every minute that you're listening to a podcast on Spotify, you're not
[01:07:57.260 --> 01:08:01.300]   they're not paying royalties to a music publisher.
[01:08:01.300 --> 01:08:02.300]   Exactly.
[01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:03.300]   They're brilliant.
[01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:04.460]   They're brilliant.
[01:08:04.460 --> 01:08:08.980]   They also bought the I think the best podcast platform, Anchor.fm.
[01:08:08.980 --> 01:08:11.020]   I thought that I have always recommended that.
[01:08:11.020 --> 01:08:12.020]   That's great.
[01:08:12.020 --> 01:08:15.020]   Yeah, I don't like them swallowing the podcast industry whole, but I do.
[01:08:15.020 --> 01:08:17.620]   Again, I do kind of admire it because it is smart.
[01:08:17.620 --> 01:08:18.620]   Oh, I'm smart.
[01:08:18.620 --> 01:08:20.220]   Why they're doing it's good for them.
[01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:21.220]   Yeah.
[01:08:21.220 --> 01:08:26.980]   The problem is the idea of an RSS delivered audio feed, which isn't, you know, doesn't
[01:08:26.980 --> 01:08:33.420]   require any particular player, doesn't spy on you, is going to be eliminated because
[01:08:33.420 --> 01:08:36.940]   everybody will have to listen to their podcast on Spotify.
[01:08:36.940 --> 01:08:39.860]   And of course, they know exactly what you're listening to when you're listening to it, where
[01:08:39.860 --> 01:08:42.900]   you're listening to it, who you are, how much you spend, what your credit card numbers
[01:08:42.900 --> 01:08:44.780]   are, all that stuff.
[01:08:44.780 --> 01:08:48.300]   And advertisers love it, but it's not so good for the rest of us.
[01:08:48.300 --> 01:08:49.300]   That's all right.
[01:08:49.300 --> 01:08:50.300]   I'm ready to do this.
[01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:54.460]   Leo, I just, I have a question for you though.
[01:08:54.460 --> 01:08:56.180]   Do you mind the acquisition there?
[01:08:56.180 --> 01:08:59.820]   Like you get the same, you know, like all crap there, like absorbing stuff as you do
[01:08:59.820 --> 01:09:02.580]   when it's a larger tech company absorbing stuff?
[01:09:02.580 --> 01:09:04.380]   No, I feel the same way.
[01:09:04.380 --> 01:09:07.340]   I mean, when Apple started getting a podcast, I was very worried that Apple would do the
[01:09:07.340 --> 01:09:08.340]   same thing.
[01:09:08.340 --> 01:09:10.700]   It doesn't matter the size of the company is irrelevant.
[01:09:10.700 --> 01:09:15.780]   What is, what's happening though is it is, if they're attempting, if they can, to shift
[01:09:15.780 --> 01:09:18.700]   the way podcasts work a whole space.
[01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:19.700]   Yeah, from an open standards.
[01:09:19.700 --> 01:09:20.700]   Yeah.
[01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:22.620]   From an open standard to a closed standard.
[01:09:22.620 --> 01:09:27.260]   And the problem is they can draw, if they pull advertisers along with them, they take
[01:09:27.260 --> 01:09:29.060]   all, it happened to blogging too, right?
[01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:33.940]   They take all the air out of the room for open standards.
[01:09:33.940 --> 01:09:37.300]   And it means that if you're a podcaster, just like if you're a blogger, you're doing
[01:09:37.300 --> 01:09:39.340]   it for fun.
[01:09:39.340 --> 01:09:43.700]   And the very few companies started to interrupt, but the very few companies, there were two
[01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:51.780]   companies that monitored the statistics, the data in podcasts and for Spotify to do.
[01:09:51.780 --> 01:09:52.780]   But both of them.
[01:09:52.780 --> 01:09:53.780]   Sorry.
[01:09:53.780 --> 01:09:54.780]   Sorry.
[01:09:54.780 --> 01:09:55.780]   My dog Fred has very strong feelings.
[01:09:55.780 --> 01:09:56.780]   He's not happy either.
[01:09:56.780 --> 01:09:57.780]   Right.
[01:09:57.780 --> 01:09:59.500]   He's not happy one bit.
[01:09:59.500 --> 01:10:01.460]   He's all about open standards.
[01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:06.980]   He likes RSS, OPML and open standards because it's better for everyone.
[01:10:06.980 --> 01:10:09.100]   Let me make sure Fred's okay.
[01:10:09.100 --> 01:10:13.260]   And I'll take a break while we, while we tend to Fred.
[01:10:13.260 --> 01:10:14.940]   No, no, I don't mind.
[01:10:14.940 --> 01:10:16.340]   And in fact, I enjoy the barking.
[01:10:16.340 --> 01:10:17.340]   It's great.
[01:10:17.340 --> 01:10:20.500]   I miss my dog, Ozzy, who used to bark during our shows in the old days.
[01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:27.380]   Sam Patterson, CBS radio news and his brand new show show, his brand new job as a editorial
[01:10:27.380 --> 01:10:31.940]   director at what is the name of that again?
[01:10:31.940 --> 01:10:32.940]   He's gone.
[01:10:32.940 --> 01:10:33.940]   Cyber six skill.com.
[01:10:33.940 --> 01:10:36.900]   I can see it on the screen.
[01:10:36.900 --> 01:10:37.900]   Shoshana.
[01:10:37.900 --> 01:10:38.900]   It's great.
[01:10:38.900 --> 01:10:39.900]   Shoshana.
[01:10:39.900 --> 01:10:40.900]   Should I say Shoshana?
[01:10:40.900 --> 01:10:42.340]   Oh, you're my ninja.
[01:10:42.340 --> 01:10:43.900]   Shoshana or Shoshana?
[01:10:43.900 --> 01:10:44.900]   How do you like it?
[01:10:44.900 --> 01:10:47.300]   The chill, the ah, not the ah.
[01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:48.300]   Shoshana.
[01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:51.940]   My very first girlfriend when I was three years old was named Shoshana.
[01:10:51.940 --> 01:10:52.940]   Oh, really?
[01:10:52.940 --> 01:10:53.940]   That's funny.
[01:10:53.940 --> 01:10:54.940]   I was three.
[01:10:54.940 --> 01:10:56.060]   So I called her Shushine.
[01:10:56.060 --> 01:10:57.060]   I apologize.
[01:10:57.060 --> 01:10:58.060]   I know.
[01:10:58.060 --> 01:10:59.060]   Not a good name.
[01:10:59.060 --> 01:11:01.340]   Where did you grow up?
[01:11:01.340 --> 01:11:02.340]   Providence.
[01:11:02.340 --> 01:11:03.340]   She was Armenian.
[01:11:03.340 --> 01:11:07.500]   It was Shoshana, Daniki, and I think was her last name.
[01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:08.500]   Oh, that's cool.
[01:11:08.500 --> 01:11:11.340]   But is Shoshana, is it, is it Hebrew?
[01:11:11.340 --> 01:11:12.820]   Is it, is it Armenian?
[01:11:12.820 --> 01:11:13.820]   I don't know what it's from.
[01:11:13.820 --> 01:11:15.860]   Yeah, it's Hebrew and it just means rose.
[01:11:15.860 --> 01:11:17.420]   So like there's a million of me there.
[01:11:17.420 --> 01:11:20.020]   A bunch of me in New York, not many of me in DC.
[01:11:20.020 --> 01:11:21.020]   I love it.
[01:11:21.020 --> 01:11:22.020]   But it's great.
[01:11:22.020 --> 01:11:23.020]   I get like the share thing in DC.
[01:11:23.020 --> 01:11:24.020]   Yeah.
[01:11:24.020 --> 01:11:25.020]   Well, my very first girlfriend.
[01:11:25.020 --> 01:11:27.540]   So I have a little thing for Shoshana is this way.
[01:11:27.540 --> 01:11:28.940]   That's the way it is.
[01:11:28.940 --> 01:11:29.940]   It's great to have you.
[01:11:29.940 --> 01:11:30.940]   Always a pleasure.
[01:11:30.940 --> 01:11:32.700]   You're so much, you're so much fun.
[01:11:32.700 --> 01:11:37.060]   And I love getting somebody with the more libertarian conservative viewpoint on.
[01:11:37.060 --> 01:11:41.420]   We are often, we are often get complaints that you guys are such liberals.
[01:11:41.420 --> 01:11:44.940]   And so I just want to thank you for representing that point of view.
[01:11:44.940 --> 01:11:46.740]   It's great to have you on.
[01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:50.220]   And of course from six colors.com.
[01:11:50.220 --> 01:11:51.940]   And now Mac break weekly.
[01:11:51.940 --> 01:11:54.540]   The Vanda for Jason Snell.
[01:11:54.540 --> 01:11:56.260]   Great to have all three of you.
[01:11:56.260 --> 01:11:57.260]   I showed it.
[01:11:57.260 --> 01:11:59.540]   I brought to you by Melissa.
[01:11:59.540 --> 01:12:03.100]   Melissa, another girl's name I like quite a bit.
[01:12:03.100 --> 01:12:07.380]   Melissa is the address expert.
[01:12:07.380 --> 01:12:12.380]   Do you know poor data quality can cost businesses an average of $15 million a year?
[01:12:12.380 --> 01:12:13.380]   What do I mean by that?
[01:12:13.380 --> 01:12:16.660]   Well, your address list, your customer list, your supplier list.
[01:12:16.660 --> 01:12:21.260]   If you've got the wrong email, the wrong name, the wrong address, that costs you money.
[01:12:21.260 --> 01:12:24.820]   If you're a small to medium sized business, every penny counts.
[01:12:24.820 --> 01:12:30.740]   The longer poor quality data stays on your system, the more losses you can accumulate.
[01:12:30.740 --> 01:12:33.260]   It's so important that your customer information is accurate.
[01:12:33.260 --> 01:12:38.780]   Melissa is the address expert, the leading provider of global data quality and address
[01:12:38.780 --> 01:12:39.780]   management solutions.
[01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:42.500]   It's also a customer service issue, right?
[01:12:42.500 --> 01:12:47.220]   If you have a customer support line and somebody calls in saying your Frammets isn't working
[01:12:47.220 --> 01:12:53.820]   and you address them incorrectly or say, "Oh yeah, you're living in Florida now, right?
[01:12:53.820 --> 01:12:55.660]   No, I'm in Iowa.
[01:12:55.660 --> 01:12:56.660]   That isn't good.
[01:12:56.660 --> 01:13:00.380]   You've already got a frustrated customer and now you're making things worse."
[01:13:00.380 --> 01:13:07.060]   Melissa has a variety of ways to clean, improve, fix your data.
[01:13:07.060 --> 01:13:11.140]   For instance, their cloud based data, cleansing and enrichment tool lets you upload a file.
[01:13:11.140 --> 01:13:14.300]   It can be an Excel spreadsheet, a CSV.
[01:13:14.300 --> 01:13:15.660]   That's right there in the first tab.
[01:13:15.660 --> 01:13:22.820]   Then you go to the second tab and you select the data quality service that you want to use.
[01:13:22.820 --> 01:13:29.460]   You map the input fields and you process your list and everything is golden, clean, fresh,
[01:13:29.460 --> 01:13:31.380]   delicious.
[01:13:31.380 --> 01:13:35.820]   Data matching eliminates clutter and duplicates, which will save you money and postage, by
[01:13:35.820 --> 01:13:36.820]   the way.
[01:13:36.820 --> 01:13:42.000]   For a long time, Restoration Hardware was setting me four, count them four of the exact same
[01:13:42.000 --> 01:13:45.380]   catalog, beautiful fork color, must have cost them a mint.
[01:13:45.380 --> 01:13:46.940]   It was the same name and address.
[01:13:46.940 --> 01:13:47.940]   They should have known better.
[01:13:47.940 --> 01:13:49.980]   Melissa would have saved them.
[01:13:49.980 --> 01:13:51.340]   You can get batch address cleaning.
[01:13:51.340 --> 01:13:56.100]   You can get name verification, which parses and standardizes first and last names.
[01:13:56.100 --> 01:13:59.340]   Make sure Shoshana is spelled with one N, things like that.
[01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:03.020]   Profiling to analyze your data and improve its quality over time.
[01:14:03.020 --> 01:14:05.620]   You can even do email validation.
[01:14:05.620 --> 01:14:08.980]   You can improve up to 95% of bad email addresses.
[01:14:08.980 --> 01:14:11.380]   By the way, you should know this.
[01:14:11.380 --> 01:14:12.380]   Very important.
[01:14:12.380 --> 01:14:14.580]   Your data is important to you.
[01:14:14.580 --> 01:14:15.700]   It's important to Melissa.
[01:14:15.700 --> 01:14:19.740]   They continually undergo independent security audits because they're committed to data
[01:14:19.740 --> 01:14:23.100]   security, privacy and compliance.
[01:14:23.100 --> 01:14:26.980]   That's why they're SOC 2, they're HIPAA, they're GDPR compliant.
[01:14:26.980 --> 01:14:29.340]   They've got a great new app called Lookups.
[01:14:29.340 --> 01:14:33.460]   It's available in iOS and Android that lets you do a 1Z2Z address update.
[01:14:33.460 --> 01:14:34.460]   You can do it on-prem.
[01:14:34.460 --> 01:14:35.460]   You can do a SaaS.
[01:14:35.460 --> 01:14:40.100]   They've even got an API so you can add Melissa data verification to your customer service
[01:14:40.100 --> 01:14:42.860]   software or to your shopping cart.
[01:14:42.860 --> 01:14:48.780]   Melissa experienced independent 37 years in data quality.
[01:14:48.780 --> 01:14:53.020]   More than 10,000 businesses know Melissa as the address experts.
[01:14:53.020 --> 01:14:56.100]   By the way, world-renowned support from their Global Support Center.
[01:14:56.100 --> 01:14:59.900]   Sign up for that service level agreement for 24/7 support.
[01:14:59.900 --> 01:15:01.820]   Make sure your customer contact data is up to date.
[01:15:01.820 --> 01:15:05.260]   Start today with 1,000 records cleaned for free.
[01:15:05.260 --> 01:15:06.940]   1,000 records cleaned for free.
[01:15:06.940 --> 01:15:07.940]   Did I say that?
[01:15:07.940 --> 01:15:10.140]   1,000 records cleaned for free.
[01:15:10.140 --> 01:15:13.140]   Melissa.com/twit.
[01:15:13.140 --> 01:15:15.460]   Thank you, Melissa, for supporting this week in tech.
[01:15:15.460 --> 01:15:17.180]   Melissa.com/twit.
[01:15:17.180 --> 01:15:22.980]   You support the show, by the way, when you use that address, so please do at Melissa.com/twit.
[01:15:22.980 --> 01:15:29.540]   We love our advertisers because they make it possible for us to do the show.
[01:15:29.540 --> 01:15:31.260]   Let's talk about Lena Kahn.
[01:15:31.260 --> 01:15:33.900]   I don't know if you're a fan, Shoshana.
[01:15:33.900 --> 01:15:37.500]   New chair of the FCC, Young Woman.
[01:15:37.500 --> 01:15:47.780]   Known for being somewhat skeptical of big tech, FTC staff said, "Yeah, we're not going
[01:15:47.780 --> 01:15:54.260]   to get involved in Meta's acquisition of Within," which is a VR fitness app.
[01:15:54.260 --> 01:16:02.500]   Lena Kahn, the chairman, overruled, and they are going to go after Meta for the acquisition
[01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:06.500]   of When, trying to halt within, trying to halt that acquisition.
[01:16:06.500 --> 01:16:11.820]   What do we think?
[01:16:11.820 --> 01:16:13.820]   I'll start.
[01:16:13.820 --> 01:16:16.700]   I heard that the barn and the horse had already left Leo.
[01:16:16.700 --> 01:16:17.700]   Maybe.
[01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:25.220]   I like seeing an FTC that is, I like seeing a little more scrutiny on these acquisitions.
[01:16:25.220 --> 01:16:31.820]   The barn has left the horse on Instagram and Facebook, right, on WhatsApp and Facebook.
[01:16:31.820 --> 01:16:34.780]   Maybe it's not too late to start paying attention, right?
[01:16:34.780 --> 01:16:37.820]   I think they're trying to draw analogies with this.
[01:16:37.820 --> 01:16:38.820]   This wasn't a huge deal.
[01:16:38.820 --> 01:16:42.620]   It was like 400 million, but I think that they were trying to say, "Look, if Meta is
[01:16:42.620 --> 01:16:48.260]   going to pivot to virtual reality and this company makes apps for virtual reality,"
[01:16:48.260 --> 01:16:54.100]   has the potential to be the Instagram, analogous to Instagram type of purchase.
[01:16:54.100 --> 01:16:59.980]   I think that this was the FTC, just asserting itself in ways that maybe it regrets not
[01:16:59.980 --> 01:17:01.820]   doing so in the past.
[01:17:01.820 --> 01:17:06.060]   I think this is exactly what antitrust is all about, a company that has dominance in
[01:17:06.060 --> 01:17:11.740]   one market using its market dominance to enter a greenfield, new market, using its
[01:17:11.740 --> 01:17:16.540]   power, its money to take over that market.
[01:17:16.540 --> 01:17:19.020]   That's exactly what antitrust is all about.
[01:17:19.020 --> 01:17:21.020]   Shoshana, is this overreach?
[01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:26.220]   My view it is, and I understand people who disagree, but for me it should be about protecting
[01:17:26.220 --> 01:17:28.260]   competition broadly.
[01:17:28.260 --> 01:17:35.060]   I don't think that there was a ton of evidence that this was even the Instagram thing, but
[01:17:35.060 --> 01:17:38.460]   in my view, even that comparison is a little off because Instagram was starting to fail
[01:17:38.460 --> 01:17:41.220]   before Meta took it over or did Facebook.
[01:17:41.220 --> 01:17:42.940]   It was a billion dollars, but it was a tiny.
[01:17:42.940 --> 01:17:45.020]   It was an app that has a small number of employees.
[01:17:45.020 --> 01:17:47.460]   I don't know if it was failing, but it was small.
[01:17:47.460 --> 01:17:50.980]   Yeah, I think if I remember and I might be off, but I think their numbers were going
[01:17:50.980 --> 01:17:54.420]   down, it wasn't looking so great and Facebook revived them.
[01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:59.100]   Even here, people complained about, for me when it's about monopolies, I guess it has
[01:17:59.100 --> 01:18:01.620]   to really be about monopolies.
[01:18:01.620 --> 01:18:04.740]   It's strange to me to say, "Oh, they can't get involved in something else."
[01:18:04.740 --> 01:18:08.940]   It's one thing if they were looking to acquire maybe Twitter or something like that or doing
[01:18:08.940 --> 01:18:13.340]   things that would force Twitter or something else like that to be under them.
[01:18:13.340 --> 01:18:17.780]   When they're getting involved in new markets, they can represent new competition in that
[01:18:17.780 --> 01:18:19.420]   market.
[01:18:19.420 --> 01:18:24.380]   I don't really have an issue with it, but one thing also, just from a governance standpoint,
[01:18:24.380 --> 01:18:28.060]   it worries me that she was going against internal FTC people.
[01:18:28.060 --> 01:18:30.500]   She wasn't really on the same page with her staff.
[01:18:30.500 --> 01:18:35.540]   I think that's really important for leadership of any agency to act as one as a fan.
[01:18:35.540 --> 01:18:37.620]   That's a little troubling, I agree.
[01:18:37.620 --> 01:18:42.900]   If they dropped the Google prosecution, they've been accused of being a little lenient.
[01:18:42.900 --> 01:18:47.940]   Of course, she's been accused of being over-aggressive.
[01:18:47.940 --> 01:18:49.420]   Maybe there's a happy medium.
[01:18:49.420 --> 01:18:58.740]   Just to make this clear, within does Supernatural, which is a very popular VR app.
[01:18:58.740 --> 01:19:01.660]   It's the first killer app potentially for VR.
[01:19:01.660 --> 01:19:04.860]   It is a huge success on Metas platforms.
[01:19:04.860 --> 01:19:06.860]   It's a VR exercise app.
[01:19:06.860 --> 01:19:08.340]   They know how well it is.
[01:19:08.340 --> 01:19:09.900]   They know exactly how.
[01:19:09.900 --> 01:19:14.180]   They have, Meta has a competing app called Beat Saber.
[01:19:14.180 --> 01:19:20.740]   It's as if, we have Beat Saber, let's just swoop up the whole market for a fitness app.
[01:19:20.740 --> 01:19:23.060]   The idea here is you set up an app store.
[01:19:23.060 --> 01:19:26.980]   You're the first to market really at this level with a platform like this.
[01:19:26.980 --> 01:19:30.140]   You know the big competition is coming.
[01:19:30.140 --> 01:19:34.140]   Apple's coming, you're gearing up, you're Meta, you're doing this.
[01:19:34.140 --> 01:19:37.580]   You can look at your app store data and you can look at your usage data and say, "What
[01:19:37.580 --> 01:19:38.580]   are the hits?"
[01:19:38.580 --> 01:19:42.300]   Then you're like, "Well, I'm going to buy the hits because this is how you figure out
[01:19:42.300 --> 01:19:47.580]   how to be successful in VR is try a bunch of stuff and see what works."
[01:19:47.580 --> 01:19:49.220]   Clearly, Supernatural works.
[01:19:49.220 --> 01:19:50.220]   Make Beat Saber.
[01:19:50.220 --> 01:19:51.220]   They want to own it.
[01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:53.700]   The argument would be, "Make Beat Saber better.
[01:19:53.700 --> 01:19:58.100]   Compete instead of buying."
[01:19:58.100 --> 01:20:01.180]   I think what they're really doing here is trying to prevent Supernatural from being
[01:20:01.180 --> 01:20:04.500]   built for Apple's VR platform.
[01:20:04.500 --> 01:20:07.420]   They don't want their competitors to get a killer app.
[01:20:07.420 --> 01:20:11.860]   The end result, I think to Shoshana's point, the end result, if you allow this, is that
[01:20:11.860 --> 01:20:15.660]   somebody else is going to build something a lot like Supernatural that is going to be
[01:20:15.660 --> 01:20:17.140]   on Apple's platform.
[01:20:17.140 --> 01:20:21.540]   It's going to be a killer app on that platform because Supernatural doesn't exist.
[01:20:21.540 --> 01:20:25.540]   If Apple's really successful, Meta's going to be like, "Okay, we'll be on Apple's platform
[01:20:25.540 --> 01:20:28.780]   too with Supernatural because we want the money."
[01:20:28.780 --> 01:20:30.780]   That's competition.
[01:20:30.780 --> 01:20:37.580]   I get it from the sense that they're trying to say, "We don't want Apple's platform to
[01:20:37.580 --> 01:20:41.100]   be as competitive with us as it would be otherwise."
[01:20:41.100 --> 01:20:45.020]   On another level, if they buy this, it's so early.
[01:20:45.020 --> 01:20:49.740]   Somebody else will make a Supernatural-like thing on Apple's platform or any other competing
[01:20:49.740 --> 01:20:52.420]   platform and it'll probably be okay.
[01:20:52.420 --> 01:20:54.740]   That's a good point.
[01:20:54.740 --> 01:20:55.740]   That's the...
[01:20:55.740 --> 01:20:56.740]   That's the opposite point.
[01:20:56.740 --> 01:20:58.980]   Again, it's the moxia of Facebook, though.
[01:20:58.980 --> 01:20:59.980]   I admire.
[01:20:59.980 --> 01:21:04.260]   Again, I am admiring corporations, but what a scam.
[01:21:04.260 --> 01:21:05.260]   What a deal.
[01:21:05.260 --> 01:21:06.620]   You set up an app store.
[01:21:06.620 --> 01:21:07.700]   People come up with apps.
[01:21:07.700 --> 01:21:09.460]   You find the hits and you buy them.
[01:21:09.460 --> 01:21:11.940]   Then you say, "Ha-ha, we own all the hits."
[01:21:11.940 --> 01:21:13.860]   That's what they're doing.
[01:21:13.860 --> 01:21:16.460]   I guess you could say, "Well, then they bought Instagram."
[01:21:16.460 --> 01:21:19.500]   All these competitors to Instagram popped up.
[01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:21.020]   No.
[01:21:21.020 --> 01:21:23.220]   As soon as Facebook bought Instagram, that was it.
[01:21:23.220 --> 01:21:24.900]   They owned that market.
[01:21:24.900 --> 01:21:27.420]   I guess the difference here is that we're talking about a potential.
[01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:31.860]   The Apple thing looming here is they are gearing up for war.
[01:21:31.860 --> 01:21:34.220]   That's what this really is, isn't it?
[01:21:34.220 --> 01:21:42.680]   They know that Supernatural, if it is a standalone, is going to be like a AAA game maker who
[01:21:42.680 --> 01:21:45.660]   makes a deal with Sony or Microsoft for an exclusive.
[01:21:45.660 --> 01:21:48.820]   They're going to have upper hand and they're going to be able to make a lot of extra money
[01:21:48.820 --> 01:21:54.300]   and charge Facebook, Meta, extra money, or Apple to get an exclusive.
[01:21:54.300 --> 01:21:58.420]   It's probably limited and then in the end it's going to be on both platforms.
[01:21:58.420 --> 01:22:02.460]   Why would you do that if you could just spend a few million now and never have to do it
[01:22:02.460 --> 01:22:03.700]   because you own it?
[01:22:03.700 --> 01:22:06.260]   That's what they're gearing up for war here.
[01:22:06.260 --> 01:22:10.900]   I think the FTC knows that and that could be one reason they stepped in.
[01:22:10.900 --> 01:22:15.100]   Rightly or wrongly, I'm not advocating for or against this, but I think that they also
[01:22:15.100 --> 01:22:21.020]   understand that there is a war coming and they can set a precedent or they can do nothing,
[01:22:21.020 --> 01:22:22.420]   which also sets a precedent.
[01:22:22.420 --> 01:22:23.420]   Right.
[01:22:23.420 --> 01:22:25.580]   Let's talk about Instagram.
[01:22:25.580 --> 01:22:29.300]   Shoshana, I know you use Snapchat.
[01:22:29.300 --> 01:22:31.300]   Do you use Instagram?
[01:22:31.300 --> 01:22:35.300]   In fact, I actually don't use Snapchat except for the hot dog.
[01:22:35.300 --> 01:22:41.820]   I put the hot dog on places when I'm hiking and now I use Instagram mainly to document
[01:22:41.820 --> 01:22:43.460]   my hiking more for me.
[01:22:43.460 --> 01:22:46.140]   I've started playing around with it, seeing how stuff works.
[01:22:46.140 --> 01:22:50.900]   It's funny, I don't actually care for it, but I like documenting my hiking, showing
[01:22:50.900 --> 01:22:53.060]   other people moves and goats.
[01:22:53.060 --> 01:22:55.460]   Wow, where do you hike that you get moose?
[01:22:55.460 --> 01:23:01.020]   Oh man, Colorado, Montana, just the West and Canada.
[01:23:01.020 --> 01:23:02.020]   I really like Canada.
[01:23:02.020 --> 01:23:03.700]   Aren't you based in DC?
[01:23:03.700 --> 01:23:09.140]   Oh yeah, I just travel a bunch of weeks during the summer and work and hike at the same time.
[01:23:09.140 --> 01:23:10.140]   It's the best.
[01:23:10.140 --> 01:23:13.140]   I just got back from Banff and they have pink pine cones.
[01:23:13.140 --> 01:23:14.900]   How cool is that?
[01:23:14.900 --> 01:23:15.900]   Pink.
[01:23:15.900 --> 01:23:16.900]   Yeah.
[01:23:16.900 --> 01:23:19.900]   Oh, I also touched a psychoactive frog.
[01:23:19.900 --> 01:23:22.900]   I thought it had peed on me.
[01:23:22.900 --> 01:23:26.500]   It put its goo on me that is psychoactive.
[01:23:26.500 --> 01:23:30.020]   I was looking at it and talking to my dad, I'm like, "It has a white stripe down its back.
[01:23:30.020 --> 01:23:32.380]   I think this might be one of those frogs."
[01:23:32.380 --> 01:23:34.820]   He's like, "Go wash off your hands."
[01:23:34.820 --> 01:23:38.900]   So then later after we're back in cell service, I Google and I'm like, "Had I licked my hand,
[01:23:38.900 --> 01:23:42.620]   I would have gone for a fun ride."
[01:23:42.620 --> 01:23:47.620]   So a little word of advice, don't lick your hands when you're hiking with Shoshana.
[01:23:47.620 --> 01:23:53.300]   All of this is recorded in Shoshana's blog on medium.com.
[01:23:53.300 --> 01:23:56.700]   Send her shoshana.medium.com, highly recommended.
[01:23:56.700 --> 01:24:01.580]   In fact, you've got a list of your favorite hiking gear if you're a big hiker.
[01:24:01.580 --> 01:24:02.580]   Oh, excellent.
[01:24:02.580 --> 01:24:05.300]   Yeah, look at all that.
[01:24:05.300 --> 01:24:10.300]   When we were in Alaska, we took a little hike, a tiny little island where Huna is beautiful
[01:24:10.300 --> 01:24:14.620]   island where we were told there are four bears per square mile.
[01:24:14.620 --> 01:24:16.980]   There are more bears than humans on this island.
[01:24:16.980 --> 01:24:23.820]   So the guy who led the hike had bear spray strapped to his chest, ready to use.
[01:24:23.820 --> 01:24:27.380]   He had one of those air horns on his back.
[01:24:27.380 --> 01:24:34.660]   So he said, "Whatever you do, if we encounter a bear, do not run, they're faster than you."
[01:24:34.660 --> 01:24:37.620]   To which I replied, "Well, I only have to be faster than you.
[01:24:37.620 --> 01:24:40.620]   I don't need to be faster than the bear.
[01:24:40.620 --> 01:24:44.620]   Nevertheless, we've encountered no bears, I'm sad to say.
[01:24:44.620 --> 01:24:48.940]   Well, you should go back, go back to my bears."
[01:24:48.940 --> 01:24:54.300]   I ended up 30 feet from a grizzly alone once and I got up bear spray.
[01:24:54.300 --> 01:24:58.600]   I had a, because you hear my voice, I sound like Minnie Mouse, I had to be like, "Hello
[01:24:58.600 --> 01:25:00.300]   bear," like a freaking idiot.
[01:25:00.300 --> 01:25:05.500]   And it worked and the bear went away, but I'm like, "I might die and I'm going to die
[01:25:05.500 --> 01:25:06.500]   like an idiot."
[01:25:06.500 --> 01:25:07.500]   Oh, bear.
[01:25:07.500 --> 01:25:08.500]   Did you have spray?
[01:25:08.500 --> 01:25:13.660]   Oh, yeah, yeah, I was eating the spray after I got up the vitamin water and then realized
[01:25:13.660 --> 01:25:16.460]   the bear spray was on the other side and then got that out.
[01:25:16.460 --> 01:25:20.220]   I hear if you spray a bear with vitamin water, they're not happy about it either.
[01:25:20.220 --> 01:25:22.500]   But you know, I haven't tried yet.
[01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:27.260]   I went the whole time I was singing, which much to my wife's annoyance, "You got the
[01:25:27.260 --> 01:25:28.580]   bear necessities."
[01:25:28.580 --> 01:25:33.740]   I figured that would scare any bear off, but yeah, they don't like responsibility.
[01:25:33.740 --> 01:25:36.940]   And when you tell them that they have to have everything in order, they're just not
[01:25:36.940 --> 01:25:37.940]   going to be happy.
[01:25:37.940 --> 01:25:40.540]   The bear necessities of life.
[01:25:40.540 --> 01:25:49.340]   Instagram is not good to say the Kardashians to which the head of Instagram, Adam Mosserri,
[01:25:49.340 --> 01:25:51.980]   says, "Yeah, you're right.
[01:25:51.980 --> 01:25:52.980]   It's not good yet."
[01:25:52.980 --> 01:25:54.940]   Yeah, is what he said.
[01:25:54.940 --> 01:26:00.620]   So Kim Kardashian and Kylie Jenner actually made a video saying Instagram really sucks.
[01:26:00.620 --> 01:26:01.780]   What has changed?
[01:26:01.780 --> 01:26:13.180]   It used to be all about photos, still photos.
[01:26:13.180 --> 01:26:35.980]   TikTok.
[01:26:35.980 --> 01:26:42.980]   What they said is some people are seeing a different Instagram because we're trying stuff
[01:26:42.980 --> 01:26:43.980]   in A/B comparisons.
[01:26:43.980 --> 01:26:48.340]   Now, Adam Mosserri says, "Okay, we're not going to do that because we heard from the
[01:26:48.340 --> 01:26:54.380]   Jenner and the Kardashians and we're not going to open to full screen photos and videos because
[01:26:54.380 --> 01:26:56.380]   that's too TikTok-y."
[01:26:56.380 --> 01:26:57.380]   I don't think that's the-
[01:26:57.380 --> 01:27:01.180]   Mark Zuckerberg said that, "No, no, no, we're doing this."
[01:27:01.180 --> 01:27:02.180]   Oh, yeah?
[01:27:02.180 --> 01:27:03.180]   Oh.
[01:27:03.180 --> 01:27:04.180]   Yeah.
[01:27:04.180 --> 01:27:05.180]   He overruled.
[01:27:05.180 --> 01:27:06.180]   Yeah.
[01:27:06.180 --> 01:27:10.220]   I mean, what they're doing is shifting from algorithmic sorting, but it's stuff you've
[01:27:10.220 --> 01:27:13.620]   already opted into, which we're all pretty accustomed to.
[01:27:13.620 --> 01:27:18.060]   Almost every social network uses algorithmic sorting to algorithmic discovery, which is
[01:27:18.060 --> 01:27:21.500]   what TikTok pioneer is so good at doing.
[01:27:21.500 --> 01:27:25.860]   Facebook has all of this incredible data, so they think they can be pretty competitive.
[01:27:25.860 --> 01:27:29.500]   But look, everybody I talked to at Facebook says that Zuckerberg and the executive team
[01:27:29.500 --> 01:27:30.940]   is just terrified.
[01:27:30.940 --> 01:27:33.620]   I mean, the blue app is also changing.
[01:27:33.620 --> 01:27:39.580]   This isn't limited to just Instagram and the blue app saw declines, both in revenue and
[01:27:39.580 --> 01:27:41.580]   active users in the live.
[01:27:41.580 --> 01:27:42.580]   There's also a-
[01:27:42.580 --> 01:27:43.980]   There's an expectation users have.
[01:27:43.980 --> 01:27:48.300]   And I think you're- On TikTok, the expectation is you're going to see the algorithm because
[01:27:48.300 --> 01:27:49.900]   you know, I mean, I follow people.
[01:27:49.900 --> 01:27:52.300]   I never see their feeds, but I see everybody else's.
[01:27:52.300 --> 01:27:53.940]   That's fine.
[01:27:53.940 --> 01:27:58.100]   But your expectation on Facebook is you're going to see, and I think Instagram, you're
[01:27:58.100 --> 01:28:00.980]   going to see the people you follow and what they're up to.
[01:28:00.980 --> 01:28:03.100]   That's why I use Instagram.
[01:28:03.100 --> 01:28:04.780]   And I stopped using Facebook.
[01:28:04.780 --> 01:28:06.700]   The algorithm is the enemy, I think.
[01:28:06.700 --> 01:28:10.740]   But maybe they just so worried about TikTok.
[01:28:10.740 --> 01:28:13.220]   The algorithm is the core.
[01:28:13.220 --> 01:28:15.260]   It is everything in Facebook, right?
[01:28:15.260 --> 01:28:16.260]   Right.
[01:28:16.260 --> 01:28:20.900]   I don't- I understand why they want to be like TikTok because TikTok has proven to be
[01:28:20.900 --> 01:28:21.900]   so effective.
[01:28:21.900 --> 01:28:22.900]   It is even better.
[01:28:22.900 --> 01:28:26.380]   It's like the greatest- Zuckerberg's got to be kicking himself, right?
[01:28:26.380 --> 01:28:31.420]   Because he's like, he is a social media mogul and somebody else invented like an even better
[01:28:31.420 --> 01:28:37.420]   way to turn your smartphone into like the ultimate dopamine hit in your hands, right?
[01:28:37.420 --> 01:28:38.940]   And he's like, ah, we didn't do that.
[01:28:38.940 --> 01:28:39.940]   They did that.
[01:28:39.940 --> 01:28:42.340]   And so he's like, okay, well, what do we have?
[01:28:42.340 --> 01:28:43.340]   Let's look around Instagram.
[01:28:43.340 --> 01:28:44.940]   Yeah, we'll just make Instagram into TikTok.
[01:28:44.940 --> 01:28:46.300]   And like, I get it.
[01:28:46.300 --> 01:28:47.860]   I totally get it.
[01:28:47.860 --> 01:28:49.420]   It's a more lucrative market.
[01:28:49.420 --> 01:28:51.820]   It is what the kids like.
[01:28:51.820 --> 01:28:53.300]   They're there.
[01:28:53.300 --> 01:28:56.380]   Of course you're going to get stuff you want to see if they know everything about you and
[01:28:56.380 --> 01:28:57.540]   their monitoring your behavior.
[01:28:57.540 --> 01:28:58.740]   It's kind of brilliant.
[01:28:58.740 --> 01:29:02.420]   At the same time, I just think it's a shame that they have a perfectly good or what was
[01:29:02.420 --> 01:29:06.940]   at one point a perfectly good product, different product, called Instagram.
[01:29:06.940 --> 01:29:09.860]   And they've decided sort of to just kind of cast it away.
[01:29:09.860 --> 01:29:13.940]   And I wish they would come up with a more, you know, I would like it for them to come
[01:29:13.940 --> 01:29:17.020]   up with a way either in a separate app or with a separate interface.
[01:29:17.020 --> 01:29:21.500]   And I know they've done this with the your follows part of Instagram to say, Instagram
[01:29:21.500 --> 01:29:22.740]   is both things.
[01:29:22.740 --> 01:29:25.780]   But sometimes I get the sense that Instagram is not going to be both things.
[01:29:25.780 --> 01:29:27.660]   It's really just going to be the new thing.
[01:29:27.660 --> 01:29:29.460]   And if you like the old thing, you're here.
[01:29:29.460 --> 01:29:33.620]   Yeah, if you like the old thing and you're here for the old thing too bad, just too bad.
[01:29:33.620 --> 01:29:38.700]   Yeah, it's Instagram has Jason exactly to your point is it's shifted from being a pure
[01:29:38.700 --> 01:29:43.940]   play app that had core competencies to being a tool that is used to play defense.
[01:29:43.940 --> 01:29:48.900]   Now, if we remember, especially, you know, per earlier discussions, Facebook was really
[01:29:48.900 --> 01:29:50.780]   good at fending off competition.
[01:29:50.780 --> 01:29:52.740]   They acquired other companies.
[01:29:52.740 --> 01:29:54.660]   They killed companies when they had to.
[01:29:54.660 --> 01:29:57.180]   Let's look at Snapchat, for example.
[01:29:57.180 --> 01:30:01.900]   I mean, their growth was stalled because Instagram and Facebook successfully mimicked their features
[01:30:01.900 --> 01:30:06.260]   and they used Instagram as a tool to beat other companies.
[01:30:06.260 --> 01:30:11.900]   And for the first time in a long time, maybe ever discounting discord, but for the first
[01:30:11.900 --> 01:30:17.540]   time in a long time, there is a competitor to Facebook and meta products that they can't
[01:30:17.540 --> 01:30:19.140]   do anything about.
[01:30:19.140 --> 01:30:21.420]   They seem to be fairly impotent.
[01:30:21.420 --> 01:30:25.460]   And when I talk to people inside the company, it seems as though the thing that's causing
[01:30:25.460 --> 01:30:32.700]   them the most anxiety is this inability to respond to the competition.
[01:30:32.700 --> 01:30:41.860]   They both Facebook, Instagram and Twitter now, all three have non algorithmic feed choices,
[01:30:41.860 --> 01:30:42.860]   right?
[01:30:42.860 --> 01:30:46.780]   On Instagram, you can on mobile anyway, you can click following.
[01:30:46.780 --> 01:30:51.940]   Twitter has latest versus home and Facebook this week announced that they're going to
[01:30:51.940 --> 01:30:58.020]   give you a truly chronological feed, the people non algorithmic, the people you follow in
[01:30:58.020 --> 01:31:01.180]   order.
[01:31:01.180 --> 01:31:07.780]   Isn't that all three companies saying, yeah, we hear you, you hate algorithm or no, they're
[01:31:07.780 --> 01:31:13.860]   going to do algorithm because the people weren't vocal spend more time on the algorithmic feed,
[01:31:13.860 --> 01:31:14.860]   right?
[01:31:14.860 --> 01:31:18.060]   That's exactly it's like the nerds and it's not necessarily nerds like us, but it's the
[01:31:18.060 --> 01:31:24.060]   nerds of the platforms, the completed the ones who can want to control everything of
[01:31:24.060 --> 01:31:25.060]   the thing that they love.
[01:31:25.060 --> 01:31:26.060]   Hate it, right?
[01:31:26.060 --> 01:31:29.380]   They always hate it, but there are always going to be more casual users than there are
[01:31:29.380 --> 01:31:32.300]   nerds and the casual users don't aren't completed.
[01:31:32.300 --> 01:31:33.940]   So they want stuff floated up.
[01:31:33.940 --> 01:31:34.940]   It's more effective.
[01:31:34.940 --> 01:31:35.980]   It makes them more money.
[01:31:35.980 --> 01:31:41.500]   And as a social media nerd on Twitter, let's say, which I am, you got to have that moment
[01:31:41.500 --> 01:31:45.740]   where you just say, please just let me watch it the way I want.
[01:31:45.740 --> 01:31:50.460]   Do whatever you want to do to the rest of them, but let me have it the way I want it.
[01:31:50.460 --> 01:31:51.460]   And we'll see.
[01:31:51.460 --> 01:31:52.980]   But yeah, because they know it works.
[01:31:52.980 --> 01:31:53.980]   I mean, that's the truth of it, right?
[01:31:53.980 --> 01:31:56.420]   They wouldn't do it if it made them less money.
[01:31:56.420 --> 01:31:57.420]   I mean, go ahead.
[01:31:57.420 --> 01:32:04.380]   I like the word completus too, because I think that really is what a lot of this is
[01:32:04.380 --> 01:32:05.380]   about.
[01:32:05.380 --> 01:32:09.420]   The people who just want to see everything their way, you know, really have that control.
[01:32:09.420 --> 01:32:13.580]   It's a good way to put it because I can, I definitely have those instincts on platforms
[01:32:13.580 --> 01:32:16.020]   that I use a little bit too much.
[01:32:16.020 --> 01:32:18.220]   But I think you're right about the algorithm thing.
[01:32:18.220 --> 01:32:19.220]   Like they like it.
[01:32:19.220 --> 01:32:24.860]   But at the same time, I think with Facebook too, Facebook's always tried and meta is always
[01:32:24.860 --> 01:32:26.420]   trying to do everything at once.
[01:32:26.420 --> 01:32:30.860]   I mean, even if you go on Facebook now, there's like 10,000 little apps in there that you
[01:32:30.860 --> 01:32:34.940]   can integrate into other stuff like Farmville isn't much of a thing, but they're still alternatives
[01:32:34.940 --> 01:32:35.940]   like that.
[01:32:35.940 --> 01:32:41.300]   Like kind of wonder if them not valuing Instagram as much as kind of an extension of that.
[01:32:41.300 --> 01:32:43.540]   Like, oh, well, we need to beat out this other thing.
[01:32:43.540 --> 01:32:48.140]   So let's just model this into this other thing and have it become something else rather than
[01:32:48.140 --> 01:32:51.940]   like, hey, maybe this is our competitive advantage in a certain way that will compete
[01:32:51.940 --> 01:32:53.060]   with them by being different.
[01:32:53.060 --> 01:32:56.940]   Do you think at some point they phase out the non algorithmic feeds?
[01:32:56.940 --> 01:33:02.580]   You're just doing that to appease us completists and then eventually because the money is, you
[01:33:02.580 --> 01:33:03.940]   know, to me, it's expectation.
[01:33:03.940 --> 01:33:04.940]   I'll say it again.
[01:33:04.940 --> 01:33:07.380]   TikTok, I don't have any expectation of seeing everything.
[01:33:07.380 --> 01:33:10.380]   I go there for quick entertainment hits and I swipe through it and I don't care if the
[01:33:10.380 --> 01:33:12.620]   people I follow show up or not.
[01:33:12.620 --> 01:33:16.220]   They have a for you page and a following page.
[01:33:16.220 --> 01:33:21.500]   Ironically, I still don't see the people I follow on the following page.
[01:33:21.500 --> 01:33:25.900]   I know this because I follow my son who is a big TikTokker and I don't see half of his
[01:33:25.900 --> 01:33:26.900]   videos.
[01:33:26.900 --> 01:33:29.580]   So I know they ignore what I'm saying, but at this.
[01:33:29.580 --> 01:33:31.900]   I feel like there is a use case though, right?
[01:33:31.900 --> 01:33:36.500]   Like I think it won't go away forever because there is a use case, which is you need somebody
[01:33:36.500 --> 01:33:40.260]   says, oh, did you see that thing I posted on Facebook and you're like, no, let me go
[01:33:40.260 --> 01:33:41.260]   look for it.
[01:33:41.260 --> 01:33:45.860]   Facebook and I think this is what Facebook started it with and an Instagram too is I'm
[01:33:45.860 --> 01:33:52.100]   going to see the latest pictures from the people I follow family, friends, brands, whatever
[01:33:52.100 --> 01:33:55.940]   and I'm going to see them in order and that's what I want.
[01:33:55.940 --> 01:33:57.540]   And I do think that's the expectation.
[01:33:57.540 --> 01:34:02.140]   I don't think it's the expectation on TikTok, but I do think it's the expectation on Instagram
[01:34:02.140 --> 01:34:03.460]   and Facebook.
[01:34:03.460 --> 01:34:05.500]   Now Twitter, maybe I use both.
[01:34:05.500 --> 01:34:10.300]   So when I when I when I haven't been on for a while, I'll use the algorithmic feed because
[01:34:10.300 --> 01:34:14.260]   it shows you how it's part of this is how well the algorithm works too.
[01:34:14.260 --> 01:34:18.900]   By the way, if the algorithm sucks, doesn't matter, but the algorithmic feed, if I haven't
[01:34:18.900 --> 01:34:22.460]   been on for a while, but if it's the middle of the night or it's the middle of the night,
[01:34:22.460 --> 01:34:26.220]   and I nobody I'm no is up, but on the other hand, if I've been checking regularly, I want
[01:34:26.220 --> 01:34:27.420]   to see the chronological fee.
[01:34:27.420 --> 01:34:31.300]   I want to see the latest tweets because I don't I'm afraid that they'll the algorithm will
[01:34:31.300 --> 01:34:33.820]   filter out stuff I care about.
[01:34:33.820 --> 01:34:38.980]   So I like the choice and on again, that's three different expectations.
[01:34:38.980 --> 01:34:44.940]   The expectation for Instagram, one for TikTok and one for Twitter and why should everything
[01:34:44.940 --> 01:34:46.220]   be the same?
[01:34:46.220 --> 01:34:49.460]   That's why choice is good, right?
[01:34:49.460 --> 01:34:53.860]   And because because there is a use case for it, I think to answer your earlier question,
[01:34:53.860 --> 01:34:57.540]   I don't think it's going to go away entirely.
[01:34:57.540 --> 01:35:01.220]   But I think for people who love it and think it's the number one use case, they're just
[01:35:01.220 --> 01:35:07.180]   going to be sad because it's going to be buried away as sort of the a lesser view, a view
[01:35:07.180 --> 01:35:10.740]   that you have to click through a couple of places to get to see something because most
[01:35:10.740 --> 01:35:12.980]   people just don't don't want to use it that way.
[01:35:12.980 --> 01:35:18.620]   Well, and the other reason I don't like algorithmic is more subtle and more of a maybe a bias,
[01:35:18.620 --> 01:35:25.140]   which is I feel like algorithmic feeds are the feeds that get you in trouble that YouTube's
[01:35:25.140 --> 01:35:30.300]   algorithmic feed is the one that radicalizes you because it brings you down a rabbit hole.
[01:35:30.300 --> 01:35:37.060]   So I'm concerned that algorithmic feeds are the way that a company can enforce its own
[01:35:37.060 --> 01:35:43.380]   worldview and actually modify your worldview using its algorithm, whether intentionally
[01:35:43.380 --> 01:35:44.380]   or not.
[01:35:44.380 --> 01:35:45.380]   And biases.
[01:35:45.380 --> 01:35:46.780]   And biases.
[01:35:46.780 --> 01:35:52.380]   So I kind of against algorithmic because it feels a little icky to me that these guys
[01:35:52.380 --> 01:35:56.220]   are telling me what's important because I don't necessarily think that's good.
[01:35:56.220 --> 01:36:01.340]   It's funny, you sound like more of the conservatives I have in my feed who think the same thing,
[01:36:01.340 --> 01:36:04.940]   but they think that all the platforms are just trying to turn them into radical of wealth,
[01:36:04.940 --> 01:36:07.860]   liberals and all that stuff.
[01:36:07.860 --> 01:36:12.580]   But I think part of it too is just that it's all our biases too that kind of feed into
[01:36:12.580 --> 01:36:14.460]   there a little bit.
[01:36:14.460 --> 01:36:19.500]   I have hiking pugs that show up in my Instagram timeline because I love pugs and I love hiking
[01:36:19.500 --> 01:36:24.460]   and a couple of them that can breathe through it do hike.
[01:36:24.460 --> 01:36:26.340]   But I would seek it out on my own anyway.
[01:36:26.340 --> 01:36:28.740]   And I think that ends up being the case a lot of the time.
[01:36:28.740 --> 01:36:31.940]   Like you might discover stuff that you like otherwise, but I think a lot of it really
[01:36:31.940 --> 01:36:36.260]   does come down to people like to seek out confirmation bias and that'll happen no matter
[01:36:36.260 --> 01:36:37.760]   what.
[01:36:37.760 --> 01:36:42.140]   If you are a Twitter fan, you may be distressed to learn that the Twitter blue subscription
[01:36:42.140 --> 01:36:43.380]   is going up.
[01:36:43.380 --> 01:36:45.380]   Thank you, Elon.
[01:36:45.380 --> 01:36:47.420]   No, I don't know.
[01:36:47.420 --> 01:36:51.860]   I have a Twitter blue subscriber and I canceled it.
[01:36:51.860 --> 01:36:52.860]   I'm not going to pay.
[01:36:52.860 --> 01:36:53.860]   I don't mind three bucks.
[01:36:53.860 --> 01:36:55.860]   I ain't paying five bucks.
[01:36:55.860 --> 01:36:57.580]   Well I'd like to see some value.
[01:36:57.580 --> 01:37:03.260]   The value is super limited and that was the problem is it was just not quite all there.
[01:37:03.260 --> 01:37:07.980]   They have taken sort of bits of Nuzzle and turned that into what I was paying for.
[01:37:07.980 --> 01:37:09.980]   Yeah, it's okay.
[01:37:09.980 --> 01:37:11.780]   They added a top stories.
[01:37:11.780 --> 01:37:15.260]   First it was top stories of people you follow links that were shared.
[01:37:15.260 --> 01:37:19.260]   They've added a of the people they follow, which was a Nuzzle feature that actually kind
[01:37:19.260 --> 01:37:21.980]   of roots up some stuff that's interesting.
[01:37:21.980 --> 01:37:25.780]   But it's so basic.
[01:37:25.780 --> 01:37:28.300]   I was kind of spending three dollars on a whim.
[01:37:28.300 --> 01:37:32.620]   Okay, Twitter, let's see where this goes and where it was.
[01:37:32.620 --> 01:37:34.860]   No new features and we're going to charge you more.
[01:37:34.860 --> 01:37:38.180]   Well, I mean, it's not going anywhere.
[01:37:38.180 --> 01:37:39.620]   Forget it.
[01:37:39.620 --> 01:37:42.460]   My typos aren't worth five bucks a month.
[01:37:42.460 --> 01:37:46.460]   So will I lose the Nuzzle features if I don't pay for it?
[01:37:46.460 --> 01:37:51.420]   Yeah, that top stories with links is a Twitter blue feature and that's literally the only
[01:37:51.420 --> 01:37:54.860]   feature that I was using in Twitter blue.
[01:37:54.860 --> 01:38:02.340]   Oh, that and there's a thread reader that's good that you lose and there's some site links
[01:38:02.340 --> 01:38:04.980]   that turn off ads when you follow through.
[01:38:04.980 --> 01:38:06.740]   They're real limited.
[01:38:06.740 --> 01:38:07.740]   But like something to build on.
[01:38:07.740 --> 01:38:09.820]   Yeah, it's mediocre for three bucks.
[01:38:09.820 --> 01:38:10.820]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:38:10.820 --> 01:38:11.820]   For three bucks.
[01:38:11.820 --> 01:38:12.820]   I don't mind mediocre.
[01:38:12.820 --> 01:38:13.820]   Five bucks.
[01:38:13.820 --> 01:38:14.820]   What's the value here?
[01:38:14.820 --> 01:38:15.820]   I want some meat.
[01:38:15.820 --> 01:38:16.820]   Yeah.
[01:38:16.820 --> 01:38:17.820]   Yeah.
[01:38:17.820 --> 01:38:19.420]   So you don't want Nuzzle back.
[01:38:19.420 --> 01:38:20.420]   I do too.
[01:38:20.420 --> 01:38:21.420]   No kidding.
[01:38:21.420 --> 01:38:23.940]   But that's but we're in a specialized field.
[01:38:23.940 --> 01:38:25.420]   We're news types, right?
[01:38:25.420 --> 01:38:26.900]   No, I'm sure.
[01:38:26.900 --> 01:38:31.740]   That's really it is like the Nuzzle harness the power of Twitter and lists and following
[01:38:31.740 --> 01:38:38.780]   lists to help people in our situation to kind of like graze the media that matters.
[01:38:38.780 --> 01:38:39.940]   And that's a product, right?
[01:38:39.940 --> 01:38:43.820]   And we talked about about meta buying supernatural, right?
[01:38:43.820 --> 01:38:46.660]   So all right, Nuzzle probably was had run out of road.
[01:38:46.660 --> 01:38:49.780]   So they get bought by Twitter and it's like a feature leveraging Twitter.
[01:38:49.780 --> 01:38:54.820]   And yet, okay, if it's just for people like us, why don't you put a small team on it and
[01:38:54.820 --> 01:38:58.780]   make it super awesome and charge us $20 a month or $10 a month or something like that?
[01:38:58.780 --> 01:39:03.380]   Or instead it's this kind of half way thing for three or $5 a month and it doesn't satisfy
[01:39:03.380 --> 01:39:04.380]   anybody.
[01:39:04.380 --> 01:39:05.380]   Yeah.
[01:39:05.380 --> 01:39:10.900]   Or right, bake this into, I mean, what it does do if you haven't, if you haven't used
[01:39:10.900 --> 01:39:15.540]   Twitter blue in the top articles, what it does is show you friends, articles that are
[01:39:15.540 --> 01:39:21.620]   shared by people you follow and people they follow and what this really did for me is
[01:39:21.620 --> 01:39:24.060]   illuminate the real data value of Twitter.
[01:39:24.060 --> 01:39:29.100]   And we used to talk about this a lot in the earlier days of Twitter that it was this kind
[01:39:29.100 --> 01:39:30.100]   of huge data.
[01:39:30.100 --> 01:39:34.820]   It was a front end to a huge data store of social activity and news activity.
[01:39:34.820 --> 01:39:40.020]   And what the acquisition of Nuzzle and then the top articles did for me is show feature
[01:39:40.020 --> 01:39:41.860]   the potential of Twitter.
[01:39:41.860 --> 01:39:43.660]   It could be a really cool thing.
[01:39:43.660 --> 01:39:47.260]   In fact, this maybe should be a regular feature.
[01:39:47.260 --> 01:39:55.540]   Instead it's packaged in this kind of mediocre Twitter blue and it's not as good.
[01:39:55.540 --> 01:39:57.780]   So I have a feeling this is going to backfire.
[01:39:57.780 --> 01:40:01.460]   On the other hand, I have a feeling that Twitter is going to prevail in chancey court
[01:40:01.460 --> 01:40:04.460]   in Delaware and get a few billion out of Elon.
[01:40:04.460 --> 01:40:07.820]   So maybe they won't need my five bucks.
[01:40:07.820 --> 01:40:08.820]   Yeah.
[01:40:08.820 --> 01:40:12.060]   Elon is now countersuing in case you're curious.
[01:40:12.060 --> 01:40:18.060]   And the judges decided that the Twitter versus Muck's case will go to court in October.
[01:40:18.060 --> 01:40:20.060]   They actually set the dates.
[01:40:20.060 --> 01:40:21.420]   So this will be fun.
[01:40:21.420 --> 01:40:26.060]   I wonder if it'll get as much coverage as the Johnny Depp Amber Heard trial.
[01:40:26.060 --> 01:40:29.460]   Do you think it will on this channel?
[01:40:29.460 --> 01:40:35.660]   No, because it's not as titillating to talk about corporate law.
[01:40:35.660 --> 01:40:36.660]   It's not.
[01:40:36.660 --> 01:40:42.540]   But he might have as many bots as Johnny Depp.
[01:40:42.540 --> 01:40:43.900]   Joshana, what did you say?
[01:40:43.900 --> 01:40:44.900]   Oh, yeah.
[01:40:44.900 --> 01:40:45.900]   I think it just depends on the group.
[01:40:45.900 --> 01:40:46.900]   Like we'll be watching.
[01:40:46.900 --> 01:40:48.900]   I didn't follow the Heard Depp stuff.
[01:40:48.900 --> 01:40:50.140]   Like that was so depressing.
[01:40:50.140 --> 01:40:51.140]   That was awful.
[01:40:51.140 --> 01:40:54.860]   Two horrible people suing each other.
[01:40:54.860 --> 01:40:55.860]   Great.
[01:40:55.860 --> 01:40:57.460]   Yeah, I didn't need that.
[01:40:57.460 --> 01:41:04.180]   No, but I am a little curious because Elon promised to pay 44 billion sight unseen essentially.
[01:41:04.180 --> 01:41:06.620]   You know, no due diligence.
[01:41:06.620 --> 01:41:09.180]   Then claimed, well, I want to do due diligence.
[01:41:09.180 --> 01:41:10.460]   Twitter said, no, you signed.
[01:41:10.460 --> 01:41:11.460]   You're going to pay.
[01:41:11.460 --> 01:41:14.020]   The problem is, Elon doesn't have all that money.
[01:41:14.020 --> 01:41:16.340]   He only raised, he has about 21 billion.
[01:41:16.340 --> 01:41:18.580]   The rest he borrowed.
[01:41:18.580 --> 01:41:23.140]   I don't think they can force the lenders to pony up.
[01:41:23.140 --> 01:41:25.260]   And they ain't going to get 44 billion out of Elon.
[01:41:25.260 --> 01:41:28.700]   So my prediction is it's just going to be they're not going to get the billion dollar
[01:41:28.700 --> 01:41:29.700]   breakup fee.
[01:41:29.700 --> 01:41:30.700]   It'll be more than that.
[01:41:30.700 --> 01:41:32.180]   The chance of court is going to make him hurt a little bit.
[01:41:32.180 --> 01:41:36.580]   So it'll be, you know, some number of billions of dollars going into Twitter's pocket.
[01:41:36.580 --> 01:41:42.700]   And I hope they put it to good use because he really did cause a mess.
[01:41:42.700 --> 01:41:49.260]   People left Twitter, a lot of morale, you know, tumbled.
[01:41:49.260 --> 01:41:53.100]   It just was a mess and he should have some, you know, he should pay.
[01:41:53.100 --> 01:41:57.660]   Yeah, I miss when, when Elon was kind of like the cool innovator, we didn't know much
[01:41:57.660 --> 01:42:02.500]   about like, you know, the mystery was nice when I didn't know anything.
[01:42:02.500 --> 01:42:06.780]   And when Rick and Morty did Elon Tusk, let's just have cool guy who like we're going to
[01:42:06.780 --> 01:42:09.180]   do a chill pun with nothing weird about him.
[01:42:09.180 --> 01:42:12.740]   He's just very, very, he's just a smart guy.
[01:42:12.740 --> 01:42:14.500]   And I don't know anything about his personal life.
[01:42:14.500 --> 01:42:15.740]   And he's not trying to buy Twitter.
[01:42:15.740 --> 01:42:19.420]   Like I miss those days.
[01:42:19.420 --> 01:42:22.900]   Our heroes have feats of clay.
[01:42:22.900 --> 01:42:23.900]   They're just people.
[01:42:23.900 --> 01:42:25.300]   I mean, that's, that's the truth of it.
[01:42:25.300 --> 01:42:27.980]   Take it from somebody who has covered Apple for 25 years.
[01:42:27.980 --> 01:42:30.980]   Like Steve Jobs, you know, again, he's just a person.
[01:42:30.980 --> 01:42:32.460]   He had super weird things about him.
[01:42:32.460 --> 01:42:33.660]   And also he did brilliant stuff.
[01:42:33.660 --> 01:42:37.660]   And I think Elon, I'm not sure Steve Jobs did anything quite as weird as some of the stuff
[01:42:37.660 --> 01:42:38.660]   that Elon has done.
[01:42:38.660 --> 01:42:42.740]   But the fact is, I talked to some people who think that he is a fraud and that everything
[01:42:42.740 --> 01:42:43.740]   he's done is bad.
[01:42:43.740 --> 01:42:47.940]   And it's like, well, I hate to tell you he did, he actually legitimately did revolutionize
[01:42:47.940 --> 01:42:48.940]   space.
[01:42:48.940 --> 01:42:53.340]   And although he says a lot of dumb stuff about Mars, he also SpaceX is a triumph of a company.
[01:42:53.340 --> 01:42:57.260]   He kind of revolutionized the auto industry by forcing electric cars under the road with
[01:42:57.260 --> 01:42:58.260]   Tesla.
[01:42:58.260 --> 01:43:04.020]   And a lot of great stuff doesn't mean that he isn't also a jerk or a weirdo or does or
[01:43:04.020 --> 01:43:07.020]   makes terrible mistakes like this whole Twitter thing.
[01:43:07.020 --> 01:43:09.260]   Like it's all part of the package of a human being.
[01:43:09.260 --> 01:43:10.260]   It's human.
[01:43:10.260 --> 01:43:11.260]   It's human.
[01:43:11.260 --> 01:43:12.260]   Right.
[01:43:12.260 --> 01:43:13.260]   He's all those things.
[01:43:13.260 --> 01:43:21.220]   And as big as he is, his flaws and his, you know, he says something are big as well.
[01:43:21.220 --> 01:43:24.460]   I hate to quote Neil on tweet, but he said something perceptive on Twitter this week,
[01:43:24.460 --> 01:43:27.580]   which I think he immediately then did the wrong thing about.
[01:43:27.580 --> 01:43:31.300]   But he did say like basically it was a moment of self realization that everybody is looking
[01:43:31.300 --> 01:43:36.060]   for his tweets to see, to jump on them and make them into stories and talk about how
[01:43:36.060 --> 01:43:38.100]   he's lost it and all this stuff.
[01:43:38.100 --> 01:43:40.500]   And, and that maybe he should just focus on other stuff.
[01:43:40.500 --> 01:43:45.380]   And I'm sitting there thinking, yes, Elon, that is you saying stop tweeting.
[01:43:45.380 --> 01:43:46.580]   Please stop tweeting now.
[01:43:46.580 --> 01:43:48.140]   And of course he didn't stop.
[01:43:48.140 --> 01:43:49.140]   Yeah.
[01:43:49.140 --> 01:43:54.980]   So, well, meanwhile he's added a command to the Tesla, which he just tweeted about open
[01:43:54.980 --> 01:43:56.060]   butthole.
[01:43:56.060 --> 01:44:00.580]   So he's really revolutionized the car business as well.
[01:44:00.580 --> 01:44:01.580]   Yeah.
[01:44:01.580 --> 01:44:02.580]   Yeah.
[01:44:02.580 --> 01:44:04.940]   That was the South Park episode with it like that.
[01:44:04.940 --> 01:44:06.620]   That's what I'm hearing there that.
[01:44:06.620 --> 01:44:10.580]   Oh, he's referring to somebody, but he put it in.
[01:44:10.580 --> 01:44:11.580]   Oh, yeah.
[01:44:11.580 --> 01:44:12.580]   Yeah.
[01:44:12.580 --> 01:44:13.580]   Yeah.
[01:44:13.580 --> 01:44:17.060]   I mean, like in my mind, I'm hearing South Park, but I don't think he's South parking,
[01:44:17.060 --> 01:44:19.180]   but I that was a great episode.
[01:44:19.180 --> 01:44:20.700]   Well, look at this.
[01:44:20.700 --> 01:44:22.140]   He is a sponge bobbing.
[01:44:22.140 --> 01:44:24.140]   I think you'd appreciate this.
[01:44:24.140 --> 01:44:27.620]   And the song you memorized comes on in the car.
[01:44:27.620 --> 01:44:30.540]   And then he points out, all Teslas come with a free karaoke app.
[01:44:30.540 --> 01:44:33.460]   That's what you need in an automobile these days.
[01:44:33.460 --> 01:44:34.460]   Yeah.
[01:44:34.460 --> 01:44:35.460]   Priorities.
[01:44:35.460 --> 01:44:38.140]   He does tweet a lot.
[01:44:38.140 --> 01:44:39.540]   I'm looking for the tweet you mentioned.
[01:44:39.540 --> 01:44:40.780]   There's so much.
[01:44:40.780 --> 01:44:41.780]   It's entertaining.
[01:44:41.780 --> 01:44:42.780]   It's entertaining.
[01:44:42.780 --> 01:44:43.780]   Yeah.
[01:44:43.780 --> 01:44:47.060]   Our show today brought to you by Colide.
[01:44:47.060 --> 01:44:48.620]   I know you know Colide, Jason.
[01:44:48.620 --> 01:44:49.620]   They're good sponsors.
[01:44:49.620 --> 01:44:50.940]   Sixcolors.com.
[01:44:50.940 --> 01:44:52.940]   I love this idea.
[01:44:52.940 --> 01:44:57.940]   It's kind of the antithesis to the old school device management story.
[01:44:57.940 --> 01:45:00.340]   You probably know well.
[01:45:00.340 --> 01:45:02.620]   An IT department locks everything down.
[01:45:02.620 --> 01:45:05.780]   They put super glue in the USB ports.
[01:45:05.780 --> 01:45:08.100]   Make sure you can't do anything.
[01:45:08.100 --> 01:45:12.260]   And I understand if you're an IT man, that's, that's, that's what you need to do, right?
[01:45:12.260 --> 01:45:14.660]   To keep your stuff safe, to keep your company safe.
[01:45:14.660 --> 01:45:18.820]   But frankly, it has a problem and you've probably experienced this too.
[01:45:18.820 --> 01:45:20.260]   People rebel.
[01:45:20.260 --> 01:45:21.700]   They don't like it.
[01:45:21.700 --> 01:45:28.780]   And so what happens when you lock down security is you create rebels who end up using their
[01:45:28.780 --> 01:45:32.260]   own devices, which is far worse.
[01:45:32.260 --> 01:45:36.420]   And then bring it into the office, which could be disaster.
[01:45:36.420 --> 01:45:41.500]   Old school device management tools like MDM's force disruptive agents on to employee devices
[01:45:41.500 --> 01:45:47.780]   that slow performance and treat privacy as an afterthought and users know it.
[01:45:47.780 --> 01:45:51.660]   That way of doing things turns IT admins and end users into enemies.
[01:45:51.660 --> 01:45:55.500]   And then creates its own security problems because users turn to shadow IT just to do
[01:45:55.500 --> 01:45:56.500]   their jobs.
[01:45:56.500 --> 01:45:58.580]   Collides a completely different idea.
[01:45:58.580 --> 01:46:03.300]   It enrolls your users as your allies.
[01:46:03.300 --> 01:46:06.820]   Instead of forcing changes on them, Collides sends them security recommendations.
[01:46:06.820 --> 01:46:08.220]   Now you've got to be a slack house.
[01:46:08.220 --> 01:46:09.220]   We are.
[01:46:09.220 --> 01:46:10.220]   We love slack.
[01:46:10.220 --> 01:46:12.420]   If your business uses slack, you're going to love this.
[01:46:12.420 --> 01:46:19.100]   It starts with the user being prompted to install the Collide agent in slack and it explains
[01:46:19.100 --> 01:46:20.100]   everything.
[01:46:20.100 --> 01:46:24.100]   They're part of the team.
[01:46:24.100 --> 01:46:29.340]   And then it automatically notifies them when devices are insecure and gives them step by
[01:46:29.340 --> 01:46:31.220]   step instructions on how to solve the problem.
[01:46:31.220 --> 01:46:34.020]   But more importantly, I think gives them the information they need to understand why it's
[01:46:34.020 --> 01:46:35.860]   a problem.
[01:46:35.860 --> 01:46:38.700]   So you're reaching out to employees via friendly slack DM.
[01:46:38.700 --> 01:46:40.660]   It's not a public message, it's a DM.
[01:46:40.660 --> 01:46:43.660]   You're educating about company policies.
[01:46:43.660 --> 01:46:48.100]   And as a result, Collide can help you build a culture in which everybody is part of the
[01:46:48.100 --> 01:46:49.740]   solution.
[01:46:49.740 --> 01:46:51.020]   That's part of the problem.
[01:46:51.020 --> 01:46:55.540]   Everybody contributes to security because everybody understands it and how and why it
[01:46:55.540 --> 01:46:57.300]   needs to be done.
[01:46:57.300 --> 01:47:00.100]   Now as an IT admin, you're going to love it because you get a single dashboard that
[01:47:00.100 --> 01:47:02.820]   lets you monitor the security of your entire fleet.
[01:47:02.820 --> 01:47:07.020]   And by the way, Mac, Windows or Linux, it's platform agnostic.
[01:47:07.020 --> 01:47:10.700]   You can see at a glance, which employees have their disks encrypted, for instance,
[01:47:10.700 --> 01:47:15.700]   who's got up-to-date OS's, who hasn't updated, who's using password managers.
[01:47:15.700 --> 01:47:19.220]   All of this makes it easier for you to prove compliance to your auditors, to your customers,
[01:47:19.220 --> 01:47:20.620]   to your leadership.
[01:47:20.620 --> 01:47:26.900]   And you're doing it with your allies, the employees is great.
[01:47:26.900 --> 01:47:31.740]   Collide, user-centered cross-platform endpoint security for teams that slack.
[01:47:31.740 --> 01:47:33.460]   That's the elevator pitch.
[01:47:33.460 --> 01:47:34.540]   I'll say it again.
[01:47:34.540 --> 01:47:39.660]   User-centered cross-platform endpoint security for teams that slack.
[01:47:39.660 --> 01:47:42.500]   You can meet your compliance goals by putting users first.
[01:47:42.500 --> 01:47:43.420]   Visit collide.
[01:47:43.420 --> 01:47:47.780]   collide.com/twit and find out how.
[01:47:47.780 --> 01:47:52.020]   By the way, if you follow that link, you'll get the hook you up with a goodie bag, including
[01:47:52.020 --> 01:47:55.740]   a t-shirt, some nice stickers you can put on your laptop.
[01:47:55.740 --> 01:47:58.380]   And that's all just for activating the free trial.
[01:47:58.380 --> 01:47:59.380]   Collide.
[01:47:59.380 --> 01:48:01.620]   I really think this is the way to do it.
[01:48:01.620 --> 01:48:06.460]   K-O-L-I-D-E, collide.com/twit.
[01:48:06.460 --> 01:48:08.980]   It will make your life better.
[01:48:08.980 --> 01:48:09.980]   How about that?
[01:48:09.980 --> 01:48:15.140]   Do not make your whites whiter or your laundry better, but it will make your life better.
[01:48:15.140 --> 01:48:16.700]   How about that?
[01:48:16.700 --> 01:48:17.940]   Collide.com/twit.
[01:48:17.940 --> 01:48:24.700]   We thank you so much for supporting this week in tech.
[01:48:24.700 --> 01:48:26.420]   On we go with a show, Dan Patterson.
[01:48:26.420 --> 01:48:35.820]   It's great to have you, Shoshana Weisman, my first girlfriend, and Mr. Jason Snell.
[01:48:35.820 --> 01:48:38.900]   What else happened this week?
[01:48:38.900 --> 01:48:40.900]   I'm looking at the wrong rundown.
[01:48:40.900 --> 01:48:42.300]   This is a different show.
[01:48:42.300 --> 01:48:44.580]   I thought it looked different.
[01:48:44.580 --> 01:48:49.580]   All of a sudden I'm doing this week in Google.
[01:48:49.580 --> 01:48:53.140]   We did the Instagram Amazon Drive shutting down next year.
[01:48:53.140 --> 01:48:55.660]   I don't know if anybody used Amazon Drive.
[01:48:55.660 --> 01:48:59.580]   Amazon Photos will continue, which is still the best-kept secret for Amazon Prime users
[01:48:59.580 --> 01:49:01.340]   unlimited free photo storage.
[01:49:01.340 --> 01:49:05.340]   But if you've been using Drive, you're going to have to migrate next year.
[01:49:05.340 --> 01:49:09.980]   Let's talk Huawei.
[01:49:09.980 --> 01:49:11.860]   I know you cover securities.
[01:49:11.860 --> 01:49:13.340]   I'm very curious.
[01:49:13.340 --> 01:49:14.860]   I've gone back and forth on this.
[01:49:14.860 --> 01:49:21.260]   The Commerce Department two or three years ago said to government agencies stop using
[01:49:21.260 --> 01:49:23.300]   Huawei networking equipment.
[01:49:23.300 --> 01:49:24.500]   We don't trust them.
[01:49:24.500 --> 01:49:29.260]   We feel like they might be Chinese spies.
[01:49:29.260 --> 01:49:36.060]   It seemed maybe that this was at some point during the Trump era, predated Trump, but
[01:49:36.060 --> 01:49:44.060]   at some point during the Trump era, it was just xenophobia and maybe even prompted by
[01:49:44.060 --> 01:49:49.500]   Cisco and other US companies trying to get that networking market.
[01:49:49.500 --> 01:49:53.700]   There wasn't a lot of evidence that Huawei was doing anything disruptive.
[01:49:53.700 --> 01:49:57.100]   Now, we have some of that evidence.
[01:49:57.100 --> 01:50:04.620]   This is a CNN exclusive FBI investigation that said Huawei equipment could disrupt nuclear
[01:50:04.620 --> 01:50:10.780]   arsenal communications.
[01:50:10.780 --> 01:50:11.780]   It starts.
[01:50:11.780 --> 01:50:18.100]   The lead is the Chinese government was offering to spend $100 million to build an ornate Chinese
[01:50:18.100 --> 01:50:21.060]   garden at the National Arboretum in Washington, D.C.
[01:50:21.060 --> 01:50:23.740]   Then we're going to do temples and pavilions.
[01:50:23.740 --> 01:50:26.580]   There's going to be a 70-foot white pagoda.
[01:50:26.580 --> 01:50:28.620]   Would attract tourists, would be beautiful.
[01:50:28.620 --> 01:50:33.580]   A great perfect example of Sino-US cooperation.
[01:50:33.580 --> 01:50:38.500]   But then US counterintelligence officials began digging into the details.
[01:50:38.500 --> 01:50:43.180]   The pagoda would have been strategically placed on one of the highest points in D.C.
[01:50:43.180 --> 01:50:49.340]   Just two miles from the capital, a perfect spot for signals intelligence collection.
[01:50:49.340 --> 01:50:53.860]   Chinese officials wanted to build the pagoda with materials shipped to the US in diplomatic
[01:50:53.860 --> 01:50:59.300]   pouches so they couldn't be examined ahead of time.
[01:50:59.300 --> 01:51:04.340]   The feds killed the project in 2018.
[01:51:04.340 --> 01:51:11.180]   But at least for the last five or six years, federal officials have been very nervous about
[01:51:11.180 --> 01:51:15.580]   Chinese attempts to spy on us.
[01:51:15.580 --> 01:51:18.860]   For a long time, there was some question about Huawei.
[01:51:18.860 --> 01:51:24.140]   Apparently, according to the CNN study, there's no question Huawei equipment has the ability
[01:51:24.140 --> 01:51:32.060]   to intercept not only commercial cell traffic, but also highly restricted communications used
[01:51:32.060 --> 01:51:34.500]   by the military.
[01:51:34.500 --> 01:51:39.460]   And furthermore, has the ability to disrupt strategic command communications.
[01:51:39.460 --> 01:51:44.380]   Dan, you must have looked into this over the last few years.
[01:51:44.380 --> 01:51:46.140]   Where do you come down on this?
[01:51:46.140 --> 01:51:53.300]   The real challenge in the last three to five years has been this mishmash as you alluded
[01:51:53.300 --> 01:51:58.380]   to of various actors and their motivations.
[01:51:58.380 --> 01:51:59.380]   And you're right.
[01:51:59.380 --> 01:52:03.780]   I think there was a lot of xenophobia mixed in with these stories.
[01:52:03.780 --> 01:52:08.460]   We can have a very similar parallel conversation with TikTok.
[01:52:08.460 --> 01:52:16.780]   But at the end of the day, the reality is that our law enforcement and intelligence
[01:52:16.780 --> 01:52:23.660]   communities, although they too have their own partisan actors, have been in a nonpartisan
[01:52:23.660 --> 01:52:27.260]   way examining companies like Huawei.
[01:52:27.260 --> 01:52:32.420]   And there are real privacy and security.
[01:52:32.420 --> 01:52:38.660]   There are potentially real privacy and security threats.
[01:52:38.660 --> 01:52:41.260]   I think this is the problem.
[01:52:41.260 --> 01:52:42.260]   It's potential.
[01:52:42.260 --> 01:52:43.260]   It's potential, right?
[01:52:43.260 --> 01:52:44.260]   Yeah, right.
[01:52:44.260 --> 01:52:50.300]   And I say that I'm trying to choose my words wisely or at least hedge as much as possible.
[01:52:50.300 --> 01:52:56.500]   Although this story feels like out of a great, maybe cold war thriller, like, it has a lot
[01:52:56.500 --> 01:52:59.620]   of narrative components to it.
[01:52:59.620 --> 01:53:04.940]   You can see them saying, ah, nice try building your pagoda that would have disrupted.
[01:53:04.940 --> 01:53:12.020]   But at the end of the day, we are in an era where software and hardware has the potential
[01:53:12.020 --> 01:53:17.340]   to gather a tremendous amount of data about us and not just our consumer data.
[01:53:17.340 --> 01:53:27.140]   But there are real security and privacy threats that are higher stakes than the sandwich you
[01:53:27.140 --> 01:53:29.180]   might have eaten.
[01:53:29.180 --> 01:53:36.100]   I'm trying to be vague, but also, you know, the stakes are pretty high on this.
[01:53:36.100 --> 01:53:40.900]   Yeah, maybe it just be better to err on the side of caution.
[01:53:40.900 --> 01:53:45.900]   Christopher Ray, the director of the FBI, told CNN that the FBI opens a new China counter
[01:53:45.900 --> 01:53:49.420]   intelligence investigation every 12 hours.
[01:53:49.420 --> 01:53:55.740]   He says there are probably around 2,000 investigations currently underway.
[01:53:55.740 --> 01:53:59.820]   That's not of Huawei specifically, but of China in general.
[01:53:59.820 --> 01:54:01.340]   We're very nervous about China.
[01:54:01.340 --> 01:54:03.620]   I understand why.
[01:54:03.620 --> 01:54:07.780]   I still don't think there's a smoking gun with Huawei.
[01:54:07.780 --> 01:54:10.740]   And I guess that's the thing I'm waiting for.
[01:54:10.740 --> 01:54:15.300]   Although, you know, they make a good point, you know, given where this equipment goes,
[01:54:15.300 --> 01:54:18.420]   it could absolutely be problematic.
[01:54:18.420 --> 01:54:25.220]   And even if it's completely clean now, software updates down the road could turn them into,
[01:54:25.220 --> 01:54:28.100]   you know, weapons of destruction in the United States.
[01:54:28.100 --> 01:54:31.580]   Shoshana, is there, is this outside your portfolio?
[01:54:31.580 --> 01:54:33.060]   Or do you have an opinion on this?
[01:54:33.060 --> 01:54:35.940]   I don't know what, you know, sure.
[01:54:35.940 --> 01:54:40.180]   Yeah, no, it's, it's not exactly in mind, but I do have strong opinions just that like
[01:54:40.180 --> 01:54:44.980]   we need to make sure it's about foreign policy threats and not about economic protectionism
[01:54:44.980 --> 01:54:50.820]   because it's easy to use the first as a threat as a thin veil for the second.
[01:54:50.820 --> 01:54:54.060]   There's a lot of that during the Trump administration where it could go either way.
[01:54:54.060 --> 01:54:57.700]   Like you could see the security case, but in other cases, you're like, does he just want
[01:54:57.700 --> 01:54:59.820]   to do economic protectionism here?
[01:54:59.820 --> 01:55:04.300]   So I'm always for being wary and objective, but the Huawei stuff also does not look very
[01:55:04.300 --> 01:55:05.300]   good.
[01:55:05.300 --> 01:55:08.620]   So it's kind of one of those things where I think it has to be a case by case thing where
[01:55:08.620 --> 01:55:11.340]   I find myself going back and forth a little bit.
[01:55:11.340 --> 01:55:18.260]   There's also considerable criticism of the FCC's rip and replace policy.
[01:55:18.260 --> 01:55:26.140]   They said, well, they said they said aside, $1.9 billion to remove Huawei and ZTE technology
[01:55:26.140 --> 01:55:28.360]   throughout rural America.
[01:55:28.360 --> 01:55:32.460]   But two years later, according to CNN, none of that equipment's been removed.
[01:55:32.460 --> 01:55:35.740]   Rural telecom companies are waiting for federal money.
[01:55:35.740 --> 01:55:42.940]   The FCC received applications to remove 24,000 pieces who Chinese made communications equipment,
[01:55:42.940 --> 01:55:47.940]   but it's more than $3 billion short of the money it needs to reimburse.
[01:55:47.940 --> 01:55:52.860]   So these companies are saying, well, why do we have to pay for this?
[01:55:52.860 --> 01:55:55.540]   And they're not doing it.
[01:55:55.540 --> 01:55:59.420]   So it's a little bit of a mess here.
[01:55:59.420 --> 01:56:06.100]   And I understand intelligence often doesn't want to reveal the smoking gun because that
[01:56:06.100 --> 01:56:10.500]   then you can infer on their methods from what they know.
[01:56:10.500 --> 01:56:15.780]   So maybe they don't want to say, maybe they do have evidence and it's not unreasonable
[01:56:15.780 --> 01:56:17.380]   for them to say, look, trust us.
[01:56:17.380 --> 01:56:20.940]   There's good reason that we want you to take this stuff out.
[01:56:20.940 --> 01:56:23.700]   So I'm going to err on the side of that, I guess.
[01:56:23.700 --> 01:56:24.820]   That's how they're behaving.
[01:56:24.820 --> 01:56:30.500]   I do wonder at what point do you have to say, all I have is your word on this.
[01:56:30.500 --> 01:56:37.740]   We are banning this company and trying to tell our allies in Europe to not use them because
[01:56:37.740 --> 01:56:43.460]   you are giving us the wink, wink, nudge, nudge that something is afoot here.
[01:56:43.460 --> 01:56:49.820]   But it is, I also want to give them the benefit of the debt to a certain point because I understand
[01:56:49.820 --> 01:56:55.020]   this is about spycraft and espionage.
[01:56:55.020 --> 01:56:56.980]   It's like you don't want to give away the secrets.
[01:56:56.980 --> 01:57:02.260]   At the same time though, it does give me a little bit of pause that there has not been
[01:57:02.260 --> 01:57:07.340]   enough for me to feel like, okay, all right, all right, I buy it, I buy it now.
[01:57:07.340 --> 01:57:12.420]   Instead it's more like, yeah, okay, I'm taking you on faith.
[01:57:12.420 --> 01:57:17.380]   The other part of this is sometimes I wonder if we're not seeing the forest for the trees
[01:57:17.380 --> 01:57:21.940]   here because the truth is sure something made in China could be subverted by the Chinese
[01:57:21.940 --> 01:57:22.940]   government.
[01:57:22.940 --> 01:57:25.540]   They could know all the back doors, all of that is true.
[01:57:25.540 --> 01:57:29.540]   That doesn't necessarily mean that there isn't stuff made elsewhere.
[01:57:29.540 --> 01:57:34.240]   If it was installed next to the ICBM silos that the Chinese government would not also
[01:57:34.240 --> 01:57:36.180]   have an exploit for, right?
[01:57:36.180 --> 01:57:37.700]   We don't really know that part.
[01:57:37.700 --> 01:57:42.060]   Yeah, they're talking about this is a great article if you want to read it in the CNN.
[01:57:42.060 --> 01:57:48.820]   We talk about weather cameras that are, it turns out, Chinese weather cameras, high-definition
[01:57:48.820 --> 01:57:56.100]   surveillance cameras from a company or put up by a company called Valero.
[01:57:56.100 --> 01:58:01.620]   Capturing movement of US military equipment and personnel, the cameras provided a 24/7
[01:58:01.620 --> 01:58:08.940]   bird's eye view not just of weather but of military movements.
[01:58:08.940 --> 01:58:12.300]   The intelligence community determined the publicly posted live streams are being viewed
[01:58:12.300 --> 01:58:14.740]   and likely captured in China.
[01:58:14.740 --> 01:58:18.220]   Two sources briefed on the investigation of the times that officials believed it was
[01:58:18.220 --> 01:58:24.980]   possible for Beijing's intelligence service to task the cameras and point them in the
[01:58:24.980 --> 01:58:27.500]   direction they wanted to look.
[01:58:27.500 --> 01:58:31.380]   The CEO of the company said it never occurred to him that the cameras could be a security
[01:58:31.380 --> 01:58:35.420]   risk, but he's going to rip them out even though it's going to cost him a lot of money
[01:58:35.420 --> 01:58:39.460]   and the government isn't going to reimburse him for any more than half of the cost of
[01:58:39.460 --> 01:58:42.460]   rip and replace.
[01:58:42.460 --> 01:58:44.220]   It's a problem.
[01:58:44.220 --> 01:58:49.460]   I guess patriotism and he's going to just donate money.
[01:58:49.460 --> 01:58:52.380]   Again, these cameras, really what's the issue here?
[01:58:52.380 --> 01:58:56.380]   The issue is somebody put webcams on the interstate and they could be viewed from anywhere.
[01:58:56.380 --> 01:58:59.180]   It doesn't matter who made the webcams.
[01:58:59.180 --> 01:59:01.460]   It matters that the webcams existed.
[01:59:01.460 --> 01:59:06.140]   I would also say I bet you there are also some satellites that are able to observe that entire
[01:59:06.140 --> 01:59:09.140]   interstate as well.
[01:59:09.140 --> 01:59:13.260]   I get it and yet you've got to convince me.
[01:59:13.260 --> 01:59:19.580]   This is literally they were public webcams of I-25.
[01:59:19.580 --> 01:59:21.500]   China could look at them, so could anybody.
[01:59:21.500 --> 01:59:22.980]   It's true.
[01:59:22.980 --> 01:59:24.980]   Yeah.
[01:59:24.980 --> 01:59:29.180]   I also worry that in a lot of cases the government officials raising certain concerns are the
[01:59:29.180 --> 01:59:32.620]   ones with passwords that are password.
[01:59:32.620 --> 01:59:37.620]   It's kind of like that kind of situation because at our street we've done a lot on cyber threats.
[01:59:37.620 --> 01:59:43.740]   A lot of hacking of government agencies, of other large entities.
[01:59:43.740 --> 01:59:48.660]   I'm very open to trying to optimize security, but I'm also like, "Okay, but maybe we do
[01:59:48.660 --> 01:59:50.180]   the basic stuff.
[01:59:50.180 --> 01:59:53.500]   Not have your password on a little sticky note at your desk."
[01:59:53.500 --> 01:59:58.420]   As we unfortunately learned during the insurrection, we saw lots of that on government computers.
[01:59:58.420 --> 02:00:01.620]   I think we need better cyber security across the board.
[02:00:01.620 --> 02:00:04.460]   There's many fronts there.
[02:00:04.460 --> 02:00:08.420]   Sometimes I think it's like you were saying the far through the trees thing.
[02:00:08.420 --> 02:00:11.500]   I think we kind of missed that sometimes.
[02:00:11.500 --> 02:00:13.220]   Let me give you a bunch of stories.
[02:00:13.220 --> 02:00:15.140]   Guarantee to make you paranoid.
[02:00:15.140 --> 02:00:16.140]   How about that?
[02:00:16.140 --> 02:00:20.140]   We'll have a new paranoia section of the show.
[02:00:20.140 --> 02:00:21.140]   Discovery.
[02:00:21.140 --> 02:00:23.100]   This is from Dan Gouden writing in NARS Technica.
[02:00:23.100 --> 02:00:27.060]   Discovery of new UEFI root kit exposes an ugly truth.
[02:00:27.060 --> 02:00:33.460]   The attacks are invisible to us and they've been around since 2016, UEFI, which is the
[02:00:33.460 --> 02:00:38.660]   firmware that boots most computers, Mac, PC and Linux.
[02:00:38.660 --> 02:00:45.220]   The problem with this attack is it isn't wiped out by a hardware reset, by a formatting
[02:00:45.220 --> 02:00:46.220]   of the hard drive.
[02:00:46.220 --> 02:00:50.100]   It lives on forever.
[02:00:50.100 --> 02:00:56.180]   On Monday researchers from Kaspersky profiled something called cosmic strand, a sophisticated
[02:00:56.180 --> 02:00:59.020]   root kit that company detected.
[02:00:59.020 --> 02:01:04.020]   It's been around since at least 2016 in the wild.
[02:01:04.020 --> 02:01:08.420]   In the wild.
[02:01:08.420 --> 02:01:11.740]   Kaspersky says this discovery begs the final question.
[02:01:11.740 --> 02:01:18.580]   If that's what the attackers were using six years ago, what are they using now?
[02:01:18.580 --> 02:01:19.580]   Okay.
[02:01:19.580 --> 02:01:22.900]   There's, and you know what, you're compromised.
[02:01:22.900 --> 02:01:23.900]   That's it.
[02:01:23.900 --> 02:01:24.900]   You're done.
[02:01:24.900 --> 02:01:30.700]   T-Mobile, one of the largest data breaches in US history, you may remember this, they've
[02:01:30.700 --> 02:01:34.020]   agreed to pay half a billion dollars.
[02:01:34.020 --> 02:01:37.500]   350 million will go to customers and lawyers.
[02:01:37.500 --> 02:01:42.580]   Do you want to guess the proportions of each?
[02:01:42.580 --> 02:01:48.260]   At least 150 million will go to enhancing data security measures.
[02:01:48.260 --> 02:01:52.740]   The T-Mobile admitted no guilt.
[02:01:52.740 --> 02:01:57.140]   So breach compromised the sensitive personal information of more than 76 million current,
[02:01:57.140 --> 02:01:59.860]   former and prospective customers in 2021.
[02:01:59.860 --> 02:02:06.860]   Yeah, maybe it happened, maybe it didn't, but here's half a billion dollars.
[02:02:06.860 --> 02:02:11.900]   Which I have to say is a lot more than Tim Hortons is given up.
[02:02:11.900 --> 02:02:17.980]   Tim Hortons, we talked about this some months ago, their app, which people were in Tim Hortons
[02:02:17.980 --> 02:02:19.460]   as a coffee shop started in Canada.
[02:02:19.460 --> 02:02:21.100]   I think they're in America too.
[02:02:21.100 --> 02:02:25.380]   It's an app that was on people's phones that was just like given up all sorts of information,
[02:02:25.380 --> 02:02:28.140]   including location to everybody and anybody.
[02:02:28.140 --> 02:02:33.020]   Tim Hortons has settled the class action lawsuit.
[02:02:33.020 --> 02:02:34.420]   And I think this is fair.
[02:02:34.420 --> 02:02:40.700]   They have four different class action lawsuits in Quebec, British, Columbia, Ontario.
[02:02:40.700 --> 02:02:44.980]   The suits accuse Hortons of collecting geolocation data of its users.
[02:02:44.980 --> 02:02:48.020]   Demand recompense for the breach of privacy.
[02:02:48.020 --> 02:02:53.540]   Tim Hortons has reached a proposed settlement in which eligible app users will receive a
[02:02:53.540 --> 02:02:57.940]   free hot beverage and a free baked good.
[02:02:57.940 --> 02:02:59.940]   Hey, amazing.
[02:02:59.940 --> 02:03:01.740]   It's a lot of the under-scored.
[02:03:01.740 --> 02:03:02.740]   Okay.
[02:03:02.740 --> 02:03:06.220]   At least the lawyers only get donuts.
[02:03:06.220 --> 02:03:11.220]   Maybe it really should just put all the sensitive data on a sticky note and put it on.
[02:03:11.220 --> 02:03:13.020]   Maybe we're better off.
[02:03:13.020 --> 02:03:14.020]   Russia.
[02:03:14.020 --> 02:03:18.820]   So when I go to court, I kind of hope for just a hot beverage of my pastry.
[02:03:18.820 --> 02:03:19.820]   It's good.
[02:03:19.820 --> 02:03:20.820]   What more?
[02:03:20.820 --> 02:03:21.820]   That's the end goal for me.
[02:03:21.820 --> 02:03:23.700]   Or could you ask for?
[02:03:23.700 --> 02:03:30.660]   According to Apple Insider for about 12 hours, Russia's Ross Telecom tried to repeatedly try
[02:03:30.660 --> 02:03:35.020]   to route users of Apple services through Russia.
[02:03:35.020 --> 02:03:40.980]   Apple engineers applying countermeasures, Russia applying countermeasures repeatedly
[02:03:40.980 --> 02:03:45.580]   trying to hijack Apple's services could have been just a configuration error.
[02:03:45.580 --> 02:03:48.740]   BGP is complicated.
[02:03:48.740 --> 02:03:52.380]   False route announcements that could make internet connections to its servers instead
[02:03:52.380 --> 02:03:54.580]   of Apple's.
[02:03:54.580 --> 02:03:55.860]   But we may never know.
[02:03:55.860 --> 02:03:58.700]   Was it in purpose or not?
[02:03:58.700 --> 02:04:08.100]   And the FBI for some reason, and they're not saying why, decided to raid a private business
[02:04:08.100 --> 02:04:15.460]   in March 2021, US private vaults of Beverly Hills based safe deposit storage business.
[02:04:15.460 --> 02:04:17.380]   Okay, fine.
[02:04:17.380 --> 02:04:20.860]   They were being accused of money laundering or something.
[02:04:20.860 --> 02:04:27.300]   Unfortunately, for the users, the customers of private vault, the FBI during the raid went
[02:04:27.300 --> 02:04:31.180]   through all the safe deposit boxes.
[02:04:31.180 --> 02:04:34.140]   Attorneys representing victims of the raid say the depositions could contain important
[02:04:34.140 --> 02:04:39.460]   information about how and why the FBI decided to seize and catalog the private belongings,
[02:04:39.460 --> 02:04:44.780]   not just of private vault, but of their customers.
[02:04:44.780 --> 02:04:51.420]   They didn't, the search warrant did not cover that, but agents seized hundreds of safe deposit
[02:04:51.420 --> 02:04:56.860]   boxes anyway, opened many of them, and rifled through their contents under the guise of
[02:04:56.860 --> 02:04:59.500]   cataloging the items.
[02:04:59.500 --> 02:05:05.340]   A phishing expedition in search of additional criminality, the warrant explicitly forbade
[02:05:05.340 --> 02:05:09.020]   the FBI from seizing the safe deposit boxes or their contents.
[02:05:09.020 --> 02:05:15.460]   The FBI says we have nothing to report.
[02:05:15.460 --> 02:05:19.380]   I think we'll see a few lawsuits over that.
[02:05:19.380 --> 02:05:22.300]   All right.
[02:05:22.300 --> 02:05:23.300]   Let's see.
[02:05:23.300 --> 02:05:24.300]   Let's you know what?
[02:05:24.300 --> 02:05:28.020]   Maybe this would be a good time now that we've given you all the paranoia.
[02:05:28.020 --> 02:05:36.180]   I didn't talk about Google and Amazon handing over video from your doorbell, but you knew
[02:05:36.180 --> 02:05:38.380]   that.
[02:05:38.380 --> 02:05:40.780]   You knew that.
[02:05:40.780 --> 02:05:43.460]   Let's take a little break and come back and we're going to have some other stories, some
[02:05:43.460 --> 02:05:44.460]   lighter stories.
[02:05:44.460 --> 02:05:48.380]   I don't like to end the show on a paranoid note.
[02:05:48.380 --> 02:05:56.060]   But before we go on with our great panel, Jason Snell, Shoshana Weisman, Shoshana Weisman,
[02:05:56.060 --> 02:06:02.420]   and of course Dan Patterson, I want to talk about how we do these shows with this amazing
[02:06:02.420 --> 02:06:05.980]   tricaster.
[02:06:05.980 --> 02:06:09.300]   By the way, it's great to have a new team.
[02:06:09.300 --> 02:06:10.300]   Wait a minute.
[02:06:10.300 --> 02:06:11.660]   John's on the TV now.
[02:06:11.660 --> 02:06:12.660]   What happened to Benito?
[02:06:12.660 --> 02:06:13.660]   Oh, there's Benito.
[02:06:13.660 --> 02:06:19.820]   We fired a new technical director, Benito worked for years.
[02:06:19.820 --> 02:06:23.420]   We're using tricasters at Twitch and also it's seen that.
[02:06:23.420 --> 02:06:24.420]   Yeah.
[02:06:24.420 --> 02:06:29.540]   The reason we hired him, he's a tricaster wizard since day one, since we started streaming
[02:06:29.540 --> 02:06:35.180]   video on Twitch, I chose the new tech tricaster and I am so glad our show today brought to
[02:06:35.180 --> 02:06:38.940]   you by the newest, the Tricaster 2 Elite.
[02:06:38.940 --> 02:06:41.020]   Benito, do you want one of these?
[02:06:41.020 --> 02:06:42.020]   Yes.
[02:06:42.020 --> 02:06:45.900]   It's the most complete live production system on the planet.
[02:06:45.900 --> 02:06:51.180]   We've got a pretty good tricaster elite, but maybe the Tricaster 2 Elite.
[02:06:51.180 --> 02:06:56.260]   Some great new features, new tech offers a full line of tricasters at any price point.
[02:06:56.260 --> 02:06:59.740]   And whenever you select tricaster puts an entire suite of media production capabilities
[02:06:59.740 --> 02:07:01.540]   of your fingertips.
[02:07:01.540 --> 02:07:02.660]   We are using the two.
[02:07:02.660 --> 02:07:04.060]   Are we using the two Elite?
[02:07:04.060 --> 02:07:05.060]   Yes.
[02:07:05.060 --> 02:07:06.060]   Oh, we are.
[02:07:06.060 --> 02:07:07.060]   Oh, never mind.
[02:07:07.060 --> 02:07:08.060]   We've got the best.
[02:07:08.060 --> 02:07:09.060]   Of course we do.
[02:07:09.060 --> 02:07:12.820]   The one we use at Twitch.tv is more than a live production system.
[02:07:12.820 --> 02:07:13.820]   We upgraded.
[02:07:13.820 --> 02:07:14.820]   I forgot we upgraded.
[02:07:14.820 --> 02:07:18.860]   All encompassing digital media solution to create content for the internet, for mobile,
[02:07:18.860 --> 02:07:19.860]   for TV distribution.
[02:07:19.860 --> 02:07:23.380]   We only use a, we only scratch the surface.
[02:07:23.380 --> 02:07:25.460]   This thing is amazing.
[02:07:25.460 --> 02:07:30.700]   Late last year, new tech released an updated version of the Tricaster 2 Elite.
[02:07:30.700 --> 02:07:34.540]   Bringing in a host of new and exciting features, the live call connect feature is such a cool
[02:07:34.540 --> 02:07:35.540]   idea.
[02:07:35.540 --> 02:07:38.620]   Now supports Facebook Messenger and WhatsApp and FaceTime.
[02:07:38.620 --> 02:07:41.380]   So any production can bring in content from there.
[02:07:41.380 --> 02:07:45.820]   In addition, selectable audio and video return now enables Tricaster 2 Elite operators to
[02:07:45.820 --> 02:07:51.820]   view an audio return like any other output which makes it much more flexible.
[02:07:51.820 --> 02:07:58.540]   The new neural voice isolation tool cleans audio using AI can cancel, reduce background
[02:07:58.540 --> 02:08:02.820]   noise and automatically detect voices, maintaining an all important production quality.
[02:08:02.820 --> 02:08:04.740]   We care about that a lot.
[02:08:04.740 --> 02:08:07.980]   It's very important even in a video production.
[02:08:07.980 --> 02:08:13.940]   Increased power, flexibility and simplicity have driven these exciting new capabilities.
[02:08:13.940 --> 02:08:15.820]   Use variable support in macros.
[02:08:15.820 --> 02:08:20.900]   John uses macros to idiot proof the Tricaster from me.
[02:08:20.900 --> 02:08:25.140]   Because when I switch in my studio, I do it all with macros so I can't break anything.
[02:08:25.140 --> 02:08:27.340]   I still break things sometimes but it's nice.
[02:08:27.340 --> 02:08:28.660]   I appreciate that.
[02:08:28.660 --> 02:08:34.700]   The system offers a dynamic and powerful tool that allows me to nest macros to deliver complex
[02:08:34.700 --> 02:08:35.980]   productions more easily.
[02:08:35.980 --> 02:08:37.340]   It's actually a great feature.
[02:08:37.340 --> 02:08:38.340]   You plan ahead.
[02:08:38.340 --> 02:08:39.780]   You've got these single buttons.
[02:08:39.780 --> 02:08:41.700]   You can push that do all sorts of stuff.
[02:08:41.700 --> 02:08:48.340]   Tricaster 2 Elite now supports encoding three channels at a time from HD to UHD all the
[02:08:48.340 --> 02:08:49.500]   same time.
[02:08:49.500 --> 02:08:51.180]   That's really nice.
[02:08:51.180 --> 02:08:56.740]   They brought the live panel builder into the Tricaster which means people use the live
[02:08:56.740 --> 02:09:02.580]   panel builder to create bespoke user interfaces to customize presets within the user interface
[02:09:02.580 --> 02:09:05.860]   meaning your distributed workflows are simpler, more cohesive.
[02:09:05.860 --> 02:09:09.380]   But as always with the Tricaster, never compromising on quality.
[02:09:09.380 --> 02:09:12.180]   The NDI Genlock tool, you'll love that.
[02:09:12.180 --> 02:09:13.260]   Genlock's so great.
[02:09:13.260 --> 02:09:14.260]   NDI is great.
[02:09:14.260 --> 02:09:21.340]   That's a Tricaster invention that transforms video production, the network digital interface.
[02:09:21.340 --> 02:09:23.460]   Remote workflows, fantastic.
[02:09:23.460 --> 02:09:26.820]   You can send alpha channel through one of the mix outs.
[02:09:26.820 --> 02:09:29.860]   All of this stuff is meaningless to me.
[02:09:29.860 --> 02:09:31.340]   That's all NDI now?
[02:09:31.340 --> 02:09:32.340]   That's really cool.
[02:09:32.340 --> 02:09:34.660]   Wow, that's neat.
[02:09:34.660 --> 02:09:35.660]   So we were originally SDI.
[02:09:35.660 --> 02:09:38.060]   Have we converted now to everything to NDI?
[02:09:38.060 --> 02:09:39.900]   Oh no.
[02:09:39.900 --> 02:09:41.500]   We do 4 and 4.
[02:09:41.500 --> 02:09:45.900]   So like this PTC camera is an NDI camera.
[02:09:45.900 --> 02:09:51.820]   So it has one connection, power over ethernet and video over ethernet.
[02:09:51.820 --> 02:09:54.900]   That's really, really amazing.
[02:09:54.900 --> 02:09:59.180]   Since its arrival a couple of years ago, the Tricaster 2 Elite has offered us an incredibly
[02:09:59.180 --> 02:10:05.100]   powerful live production system and all these new updates give you so much more capability.
[02:10:05.100 --> 02:10:08.340]   It's really transformative, better than broadcast.
[02:10:08.340 --> 02:10:09.500]   But of course there's other choices.
[02:10:09.500 --> 02:10:16.020]   The Tricaster 1 Pro for producers, content creators and publishers, future ready capabilities,
[02:10:16.020 --> 02:10:23.060]   streamlined live video production, live call connect 4K UHD switching, live streaming recording.
[02:10:23.060 --> 02:10:24.780]   I mean, it's incredible.
[02:10:24.780 --> 02:10:26.980]   Explore the latest in the Tricaster family.
[02:10:26.980 --> 02:10:28.620]   Here's what we've set up for you.
[02:10:28.620 --> 02:10:31.460]   Visit go.newtech.com/twit-tv.
[02:10:31.460 --> 02:10:34.420]   That's a long one I know.
[02:10:34.420 --> 02:10:43.600]   Go to go.newtech.net.com/twit-tv where you'll find it easy to use interactive guide that
[02:10:43.600 --> 02:10:46.180]   offers advice on which Tricaster is right for you.
[02:10:46.180 --> 02:10:54.380]   And if the boss is generous, like our boss is, maybe you get the Tricaster 2 Elite.
[02:10:54.380 --> 02:10:55.540]   Really nice.
[02:10:55.540 --> 02:10:59.540]   Go.newtech.com/twit-tv.
[02:10:59.540 --> 02:11:04.700]   Thank you, newtech, for making it possible to do what we do here at Twit.
[02:11:04.700 --> 02:11:05.780]   We love them.
[02:11:05.780 --> 02:11:07.580]   Thank you, newtech.
[02:11:07.580 --> 02:11:10.260]   We had a great week this week on Twit.
[02:11:10.260 --> 02:11:12.420]   I'm a little foggy about the whole thing.
[02:11:12.420 --> 02:11:16.620]   So the team made a video for me so I can remember what happened.
[02:11:16.620 --> 02:11:17.620]   Watch.
[02:11:17.620 --> 02:11:20.980]   We were talking a little bit about adding some splashes of color to your setup.
[02:11:20.980 --> 02:11:21.980]   But you know what?
[02:11:21.980 --> 02:11:23.220]   I like the corner.
[02:11:23.220 --> 02:11:24.220]   It's you.
[02:11:24.220 --> 02:11:25.220]   It works.
[02:11:25.220 --> 02:11:26.740]   Nobody puts Jason in the corner.
[02:11:26.740 --> 02:11:27.740]   Nobody.
[02:11:27.740 --> 02:11:28.740]   Except you.
[02:11:28.740 --> 02:11:29.740]   Obviously.
[02:11:29.740 --> 02:11:30.740]   On Twit.
[02:11:30.740 --> 02:11:31.740]   All about Android.
[02:11:31.740 --> 02:11:33.340]   We got a lot to talk about today.
[02:11:33.340 --> 02:11:38.820]   Starting with Flow, who reviews not one but two devices, the Pixel 6A and the Nothing
[02:11:38.820 --> 02:11:39.820]   Phone 1.
[02:11:39.820 --> 02:11:41.780]   It looks like a neon sign that's broken.
[02:11:41.780 --> 02:11:44.380]   It's exactly what it looks like.
[02:11:44.380 --> 02:11:45.380]   Tech Break.
[02:11:45.380 --> 02:11:48.860]   I've got two really interesting new electric vehicles that have come on the market.
[02:11:48.860 --> 02:11:53.500]   We've got the brand new 2022 Rivian R1T.
[02:11:53.500 --> 02:11:57.820]   And from a company that's been around for over a century, the Ford F-150 Lightning.
[02:11:57.820 --> 02:11:58.820]   And the Ford F-150 Lightning R1T.
[02:11:58.820 --> 02:12:02.300]   This was Microsoft's first time missing on earnings since 2016.
[02:12:02.300 --> 02:12:03.300]   Yeah.
[02:12:03.300 --> 02:12:05.300]   Halfway through the quarter they said, "It's just kidding.
[02:12:05.300 --> 02:12:06.660]   It's going to be worse."
[02:12:06.660 --> 02:12:09.660]   They revised their guidance and then they still missed that target.
[02:12:09.660 --> 02:12:10.660]   That's how this company still.
[02:12:10.660 --> 02:12:12.380]   Well, Apple did the same thing.
[02:12:12.380 --> 02:12:13.380]   Yeah.
[02:12:13.380 --> 02:12:16.540]   Everybody gets to do that now because of recession.
[02:12:16.540 --> 02:12:18.820]   You know, obviously inflation's really high.
[02:12:18.820 --> 02:12:19.820]   The high value of the dollar.
[02:12:19.820 --> 02:12:20.820]   What is it?
[02:12:20.820 --> 02:12:21.820]   So well.
[02:12:21.820 --> 02:12:22.820]   But next quarter's going to be great.
[02:12:22.820 --> 02:12:23.820]   Right.
[02:12:23.820 --> 02:12:25.580]   Because this can't last forever, right?
[02:12:25.580 --> 02:12:28.380]   If you missed Twit this week, you missed a lot.
[02:12:28.380 --> 02:12:29.380]   Wow.
[02:12:29.380 --> 02:12:33.340]   I didn't realize how congested I sounded on Wednesday.
[02:12:33.340 --> 02:12:35.060]   I hope I don't sound that bad.
[02:12:35.060 --> 02:12:37.380]   I hope you enjoyed everything that happened on Twit.
[02:12:37.380 --> 02:12:42.820]   And we'll be back this week with a fabulous week, including Jason Snow on Mac Break Weekly.
[02:12:42.820 --> 02:12:44.660]   Very excited about that.
[02:12:44.660 --> 02:12:46.900]   So do you know about Leap Seconds?
[02:12:46.900 --> 02:12:50.260]   I think we even talk about it from time to time.
[02:12:50.260 --> 02:12:52.100]   You get to New Year's Eve.
[02:12:52.100 --> 02:13:01.500]   It's $11.59.59 and all of a sudden, it's $11.59 for an extra second.
[02:13:01.500 --> 02:13:07.180]   That's because the Earth's rotation and revolution around the sun does not cooperate with atomic
[02:13:07.180 --> 02:13:08.180]   clocks.
[02:13:08.180 --> 02:13:09.340]   It's a little bit off.
[02:13:09.340 --> 02:13:16.900]   So every once in a while, since 1972, world timekeeping authorities have added a leap second
[02:13:16.900 --> 02:13:20.620]   to the global clock known as the International Atomic Time.
[02:13:20.620 --> 02:13:24.500]   They tuck in an extra second.
[02:13:24.500 --> 02:13:26.180]   You know who doesn't like that?
[02:13:26.180 --> 02:13:27.260]   Computers?
[02:13:27.260 --> 02:13:29.300]   They don't get it.
[02:13:29.300 --> 02:13:31.620]   They don't get it.
[02:13:31.620 --> 02:13:36.340]   And so there is a call now from Google, Microsoft, Meta, and Amazon.
[02:13:36.340 --> 02:13:42.740]   This week they launched a public effort to scrap the leap second.
[02:13:42.740 --> 02:13:43.740]   What's the big deal?
[02:13:43.740 --> 02:13:48.900]   In fact, they say it's going to take 2,000 years before you even notice that the atomic
[02:13:48.900 --> 02:13:51.780]   clock and the Earth are out of sync.
[02:13:51.780 --> 02:13:53.940]   You don't have to worry.
[02:13:53.940 --> 02:13:56.180]   Maybe we'll correct it once every 2,000 years.
[02:13:56.180 --> 02:13:57.980]   Throw in an extra day.
[02:13:57.980 --> 02:14:00.140]   Something like that.
[02:14:00.140 --> 02:14:07.300]   NIST actually agrees, as does the French equivalent, the Bureau Intellacionel de Poise Mijou.
[02:14:07.300 --> 02:14:10.780]   Bipum, which is even more fun to say.
[02:14:10.780 --> 02:14:14.500]   The leap second triggered a massive Reddit outage in 2012.
[02:14:14.500 --> 02:14:17.020]   Problems at Mozilla linked in Yelp.
[02:14:17.020 --> 02:14:19.340]   In booking service Amadeus.
[02:14:19.340 --> 02:14:24.620]   In 2017, a leap second glitch, a cloud flare, knocked a fraction of the network infrastructure
[02:14:24.620 --> 02:14:29.060]   company off servers offline.
[02:14:29.060 --> 02:14:32.860]   Cloudflare software comparing the two clocks calculated.
[02:14:32.860 --> 02:14:34.260]   Time had gone backwards.
[02:14:34.260 --> 02:14:37.260]   I didn't know what to do.
[02:14:37.260 --> 02:14:40.180]   So I just screwed.
[02:14:40.180 --> 02:14:41.620]   Okay.
[02:14:41.620 --> 02:14:50.380]   So I guess maybe Google has an idea that might be better than eliminating leap second.
[02:14:50.380 --> 02:14:56.580]   Google has pioneered the idea of the leap schmear.
[02:14:56.580 --> 02:14:59.460]   It's actually a brilliant idea.
[02:14:59.460 --> 02:15:00.820]   I don't know if this will work or not.
[02:15:00.820 --> 02:15:05.140]   The idea is you take that day that is one second too long.
[02:15:05.140 --> 02:15:09.420]   What you do is you stretch every second by a teeny tiny amount.
[02:15:09.420 --> 02:15:13.260]   All the computers think that the day is the same number of seconds as it always is.
[02:15:13.260 --> 02:15:18.780]   But for that one day, every second is just a little bit longer.
[02:15:18.780 --> 02:15:20.700]   But it doesn't, there's no extra second.
[02:15:20.700 --> 02:15:22.780]   It's just all the seconds are longer.
[02:15:22.780 --> 02:15:23.780]   Yeah.
[02:15:23.780 --> 02:15:25.780]   That seems like a bad idea.
[02:15:25.780 --> 02:15:27.540]   Again, does that solve it?
[02:15:27.540 --> 02:15:30.060]   No, Google, does it actually solve anything?
[02:15:30.060 --> 02:15:32.380]   Don't computers, are they still screwed up?
[02:15:32.380 --> 02:15:36.420]   I don't know.
[02:15:36.420 --> 02:15:37.420]   Are you excited?
[02:15:37.420 --> 02:15:41.820]   Both the Lord of the Rings prequel and the Game of Thrones prequel, it prequels coming.
[02:15:41.820 --> 02:15:48.740]   HBO Max is going to stream the Game of Thrones prequel in 4K HDR next month, The House of
[02:15:48.740 --> 02:15:49.740]   the Dragon.
[02:15:49.740 --> 02:15:59.220]   And to celebrate, they've decided to upgrade all of the Game of Thrones episodes to 4K HDR,
[02:15:59.220 --> 02:16:01.140]   which really won't improve the last season.
[02:16:01.140 --> 02:16:02.860]   But it'll maybe, maybe.
[02:16:02.860 --> 02:16:06.060]   You know, it actually will because that season has that episode that was super dark.
[02:16:06.060 --> 02:16:12.460]   It will look, it will look much better in a higher bit rate with HDR.
[02:16:12.460 --> 02:16:14.380]   It'll actually be what actually visible.
[02:16:14.380 --> 02:16:16.100]   It was so murky.
[02:16:16.100 --> 02:16:21.980]   The entire run of Game of Thrones, even though 4K TVs were a thing, HBO back then it was
[02:16:21.980 --> 02:16:27.100]   HBO now and HBO go, their pipeline did not allow for 4K.
[02:16:27.100 --> 02:16:28.100]   Right.
[02:16:28.100 --> 02:16:32.620]   And so even though they made these shows in 4K or at least they released 4K DVDs and
[02:16:32.620 --> 02:16:34.620]   all of that.
[02:16:34.620 --> 02:16:37.820]   It wasn't until Wonder Woman 1984, a Christmas of 2020.
[02:16:37.820 --> 02:16:39.380]   That was a big deal, yes.
[02:16:39.380 --> 02:16:44.860]   That they put it out in 4K and it has still taken them until now to actually say, yes,
[02:16:44.860 --> 02:16:49.300]   this show was going to be in 4K and this whole famous show that's in the archive is going
[02:16:49.300 --> 02:16:53.420]   to be in 4K HDR because that's just never been one of their priorities.
[02:16:53.420 --> 02:16:55.100]   I guess weird, weird.
[02:16:55.100 --> 02:16:58.940]   Supposedly George RR Martin is now finishing the last volume and he says, it's not going
[02:16:58.940 --> 02:17:00.700]   to be anything like the TV show.
[02:17:00.700 --> 02:17:08.220]   At least it'll be in 4K HDR Dolby Atmos HDR 10 and Dolby Vision.
[02:17:08.220 --> 02:17:15.500]   So if you have a, yeah, if you have an Apple TV 4K and Amazon Firestick 4K or the Chromecast
[02:17:15.500 --> 02:17:20.940]   Ultra, you'll be able to watch it and the house of the Dragon in 4K.
[02:17:20.940 --> 02:17:24.260]   Hey, big congratulations to Marquez Brownlee.
[02:17:24.260 --> 02:17:28.380]   You know him as YouTube star, but watch this.
[02:17:28.380 --> 02:17:31.900]   This is Marquez Brownlee's amazing catch.
[02:17:31.900 --> 02:17:37.400]   Whoa, which made it to the number two of the top 10 sports highlights of the week on
[02:17:37.400 --> 02:17:47.060]   SportsCenter and gave his team the pride of New York, the World Ultimate Club Championship.
[02:17:47.060 --> 02:17:48.380]   Look at that.
[02:17:48.380 --> 02:17:51.500]   That guy, he has, he can get some air.
[02:17:51.500 --> 02:17:52.980]   Oh.
[02:17:52.980 --> 02:17:56.220]   And you just thought he was just a YouTube star.
[02:17:56.220 --> 02:17:57.320]   Nice.
[02:17:57.320 --> 02:17:59.560]   Very, very nice.
[02:17:59.560 --> 02:18:04.340]   Top top 10 highlights of the week.
[02:18:04.340 --> 02:18:10.440]   And then we'll end, I think on a sad note, I know everybody knows that today, uh, who
[02:18:10.440 --> 02:18:18.140]   who sent her last message, Nichelle Nichols, Star Trek actor, trailblazer, role model.
[02:18:18.140 --> 02:18:23.740]   This is NASA's tweet who symbolized to many what was possible.
[02:18:23.740 --> 02:18:26.940]   She partnered with us to recruit some of the first women and minority astronauts and
[02:18:26.940 --> 02:18:29.160]   inspired generations to reach for the stars.
[02:18:29.160 --> 02:18:34.680]   It was Martin Luther King who told her, she said, I want to quit this stupid ass show.
[02:18:34.680 --> 02:18:36.680]   She wanted to go to Broadway.
[02:18:36.680 --> 02:18:38.640]   She wanted to be on, but go back to Broadway.
[02:18:38.640 --> 02:18:39.640]   Yeah.
[02:18:39.640 --> 02:18:42.560]   And, and Martin Luther King said, you can't quit.
[02:18:42.560 --> 02:18:48.520]   You were showing the future with us in it and not as maids or other servants like everybody
[02:18:48.520 --> 02:18:49.520]   else on TV.
[02:18:49.520 --> 02:18:53.320]   You see us and we're peers and we're out there in space and the future is promising.
[02:18:53.320 --> 02:18:55.280]   You got to stay and she's like, all right.
[02:18:55.280 --> 02:18:56.280]   Okay.
[02:18:56.280 --> 02:19:00.140]   89, Michelle Nichols, Uhura.
[02:19:00.140 --> 02:19:05.100]   And if you watch strange new worlds, the new Star Trek, you could see the young Uhura.
[02:19:05.100 --> 02:19:06.100]   That's right.
[02:19:06.100 --> 02:19:07.100]   Which is pretty awesome.
[02:19:07.100 --> 02:19:10.420]   It really, it really does show that they didn't give her as much to do as they should
[02:19:10.420 --> 02:19:11.420]   have.
[02:19:11.420 --> 02:19:13.620]   It really wasn't until Star Trek, sorry, Star Trek nerd here.
[02:19:13.620 --> 02:19:15.500]   Hi, uh, Star Trek three.
[02:19:15.500 --> 02:19:18.300]   My favorite of horror scenes in Star Trek three, she actually has a great moment where
[02:19:18.300 --> 02:19:22.500]   she helps steal the enterprise and spoilers for a movie from the 80s.
[02:19:22.500 --> 02:19:23.500]   And it's great.
[02:19:23.500 --> 02:19:28.240]   So in the in strange new worlds, which is a great show, they, they have young Uhura and
[02:19:28.240 --> 02:19:33.800]   it is great to see them digging into that character because unfortunately, as iconic
[02:19:33.800 --> 02:19:37.800]   as she was on that show, they still didn't give her a whole lot to do.
[02:19:37.800 --> 02:19:41.340]   So she did get to do some more stuff in the movies.
[02:19:41.340 --> 02:19:45.520]   And, and I think her greatest contribution is what NASA tweeted out there.
[02:19:45.520 --> 02:19:53.020]   She essentially NASA said to her, maybe you should recruit people from underrepresented
[02:19:53.020 --> 02:19:55.860]   groups to join NASA and become astronauts.
[02:19:55.860 --> 02:19:58.860]   And of course, one of those people was Mae Jemison, who was the first African American
[02:19:58.860 --> 02:19:59.860]   astronaut.
[02:19:59.860 --> 02:20:05.060]   Also, the first interracial kiss on national television when she kissed Captain Kirk.
[02:20:05.060 --> 02:20:07.540]   It's true, which legendarily they wanted to shoot it both ways.
[02:20:07.540 --> 02:20:10.700]   And Shatner, um, fouled up the scenes where he didn't kiss her.
[02:20:10.700 --> 02:20:12.260]   So they had to use the ones where he did.
[02:20:12.260 --> 02:20:13.260]   Good man, Bill.
[02:20:13.260 --> 02:20:14.260]   Way to go.
[02:20:14.260 --> 02:20:15.260]   Way to go.
[02:20:15.260 --> 02:20:16.260]   Here's a great picture.
[02:20:16.260 --> 02:20:22.020]   George to Kate tweeting, uh, a lady in the later years, obviously they're at a Trek fan
[02:20:22.020 --> 02:20:23.020]   convention.
[02:20:23.020 --> 02:20:26.340]   We lived long and prospered together.
[02:20:26.340 --> 02:20:27.340]   Nice.
[02:20:27.340 --> 02:20:33.980]   And that I think is a fitting way to end this week's this week in Texas.
[02:20:33.980 --> 02:20:36.100]   Shatner, thank you so much for being here.
[02:20:36.100 --> 02:20:38.060]   I really, you are so much fun.
[02:20:38.060 --> 02:20:40.220]   Oh, thank you for having me.
[02:20:40.220 --> 02:20:41.220]   Yeah.
[02:20:41.220 --> 02:20:44.660]   I just, I appreciate your point of view and your spirit.
[02:20:44.660 --> 02:20:45.740]   You're just great.
[02:20:45.740 --> 02:20:50.300]   Uh, head of digital media at rstreet.org.
[02:20:50.300 --> 02:20:56.740]   You could follow her, uh, blog, uh, at Senator Shoshana dot medium.com where she writes about
[02:20:56.740 --> 02:20:59.300]   hiking and all sorts of other things.
[02:20:59.300 --> 02:21:01.580]   And she's also Senator Shoshana on the Twitter.
[02:21:01.580 --> 02:21:03.180]   Anything you want to plug?
[02:21:03.180 --> 02:21:06.980]   Um, I actually, it's funny about, um, the Ohura thing.
[02:21:06.980 --> 02:21:10.340]   I mean, I was watching, I watched TCM a lot.
[02:21:10.340 --> 02:21:14.820]   So I was watching this, uh, great TCM short they had about, you know, basically black
[02:21:14.820 --> 02:21:16.740]   people throughout movies.
[02:21:16.740 --> 02:21:22.080]   And it's, it really struck me how only recently we've really started to give black people
[02:21:22.080 --> 02:21:26.900]   like really good roles and they've had a bigger role in film and like the industries
[02:21:26.900 --> 02:21:27.940]   allowed them to.
[02:21:27.940 --> 02:21:33.460]   So thinking that, you know, she really had such a big role there, you know, a really,
[02:21:33.460 --> 02:21:37.500]   really notable one more so than I realized growing up because I always heard, Oh, she,
[02:21:37.500 --> 02:21:41.300]   you know, she and Will Shatner always had the first and racial kiss and all that, but
[02:21:41.300 --> 02:21:42.500]   really thinking through it.
[02:21:42.500 --> 02:21:47.420]   It's kind of amazing that she was able to play such a big role and that, um, you know,
[02:21:47.420 --> 02:21:50.900]   that, that she was able to recruit people for NASA because of that.
[02:21:50.900 --> 02:21:56.020]   Um, I mean, even in the 40s and 50s, a lot of the roles he gave black people were just
[02:21:56.020 --> 02:21:58.980]   nothing and not that they didn't have the talent.
[02:21:58.980 --> 02:22:00.780]   They just weren't giving them the roles.
[02:22:00.780 --> 02:22:04.180]   So it's kind of crazy to think how recent this stuff is so many of the roles were such
[02:22:04.180 --> 02:22:08.260]   were step and fetch it kind of horrible racist stereotypes.
[02:22:08.260 --> 02:22:09.260]   Yeah.
[02:22:09.260 --> 02:22:14.100]   She even said if you've got to be typecast, at least it says someone with dignity and
[02:22:14.100 --> 02:22:16.060]   Ohura always had dignity.
[02:22:16.060 --> 02:22:17.060]   Yeah.
[02:22:17.060 --> 02:22:18.060]   Yeah.
[02:22:18.060 --> 02:22:19.060]   Yeah.
[02:22:19.060 --> 02:22:20.060]   Absolutely.
[02:22:20.060 --> 02:22:21.580]   Thank you Shoshana for being here.
[02:22:21.580 --> 02:22:22.940]   We're all Shoshana fans.
[02:22:22.940 --> 02:22:26.380]   Gumby in our chat room says, thank you Dan Patterson.
[02:22:26.380 --> 02:22:31.000]   We're fans of Dan Patterson still contributing to CBS news, but congratulations on the new
[02:22:31.000 --> 02:22:38.740]   job editorial director at cyber six gill.com, which is what a internet threat.
[02:22:38.740 --> 02:22:40.660]   Detection company or what?
[02:22:40.660 --> 02:22:41.660]   What is it?
[02:22:41.660 --> 02:22:42.660]   Yeah.
[02:22:42.660 --> 02:22:44.300]   Thanks for having me as I was.
[02:22:44.300 --> 02:22:45.300]   Of course.
[02:22:45.300 --> 02:22:46.300]   We appreciate it.
[02:22:46.300 --> 02:22:48.300]   Shoshana was great doing a show with you.
[02:22:48.300 --> 02:22:49.300]   Yeah.
[02:22:49.300 --> 02:22:52.300]   And Fred, and Fred downstairs being very annoying.
[02:22:52.300 --> 02:22:53.300]   Oh, yeah.
[02:22:53.300 --> 02:22:56.980]   Cyber six skill is threat intelligence.
[02:22:56.980 --> 02:22:58.620]   So it's like a Google for the dark web.
[02:22:58.620 --> 02:23:01.180]   I don't want to log roller or do too much.
[02:23:01.180 --> 02:23:05.220]   Well, but we often give you guys a chance to plug what you're up to.
[02:23:05.220 --> 02:23:06.220]   So I don't feel.
[02:23:06.220 --> 02:23:07.220]   Yeah.
[02:23:07.220 --> 02:23:11.260]   And it's I wouldn't join a company that I don't believe in.
[02:23:11.260 --> 02:23:15.140]   And I mean, as you know, journalism is a call of your heart.
[02:23:15.140 --> 02:23:17.220]   You have to do the profession because you care about it.
[02:23:17.220 --> 02:23:20.460]   And I still deeply care about the profession of journalism.
[02:23:20.460 --> 02:23:25.980]   And I'm joining this threat detection company because their technology is really interesting.
[02:23:25.980 --> 02:23:30.260]   And because it's not just about the commercial interest.
[02:23:30.260 --> 02:23:33.140]   It is a product that my it does the job.
[02:23:33.140 --> 02:23:34.700]   I wish I could do as a journalist.
[02:23:34.700 --> 02:23:42.500]   It really mines the dark web and provides a portal into it in ways that are really fascinating.
[02:23:42.500 --> 02:23:45.220]   And I hope to use it for journalistic purposes as well.
[02:23:45.220 --> 02:23:46.220]   Yeah.
[02:23:46.220 --> 02:23:47.220]   Well, so here's the big question.
[02:23:47.220 --> 02:23:49.700]   You get to go to black hat.
[02:23:49.700 --> 02:23:55.420]   I am not going to black hat this year, although I love going to black hat and Defcon.
[02:23:55.420 --> 02:24:00.300]   But it is mostly because of COVID and because we have some some fun personal stuff coming
[02:24:00.300 --> 02:24:01.300]   up.
[02:24:01.300 --> 02:24:02.380]   It's probably why safe.
[02:24:02.380 --> 02:24:04.540]   Yeah, probably wise to stay safe.
[02:24:04.540 --> 02:24:07.700]   Lisa and I went on a cruise and came home with a little present.
[02:24:07.700 --> 02:24:13.620]   So it's probably better to just stay at home a little bit longer, a little bit longer.
[02:24:13.620 --> 02:24:14.620]   Great to have you.
[02:24:14.620 --> 02:24:15.620]   Yeah, just a little bit.
[02:24:15.620 --> 02:24:16.620]   Thanks, you Dan.
[02:24:16.620 --> 02:24:19.420]   Just all the best to you and the misses and Fred.
[02:24:19.420 --> 02:24:20.420]   Thanks.
[02:24:20.420 --> 02:24:24.620]   And of course, we love you so much, Jason.
[02:24:24.620 --> 02:24:27.660]   So so glad that you're now part of the family.
[02:24:27.660 --> 02:24:29.420]   And I can't wait to see you Tuesday.
[02:24:29.420 --> 02:24:35.220]   There'll be lots to talk about, of course, including apples results in your color charts.
[02:24:35.220 --> 02:24:38.540]   So many other six colors anyway, because it's on brand for me.
[02:24:38.540 --> 02:24:40.940]   And just during the show, we we coined the term.
[02:24:40.940 --> 02:24:45.460]   So now you if you want to hear more about me talking to Julie Alexander about streaming,
[02:24:45.460 --> 02:24:47.100]   you don't even have to look it up.
[02:24:47.100 --> 02:24:49.820]   Just go to churn valet.com, which I now own.
[02:24:49.820 --> 02:24:51.220]   Oh, you bought it.
[02:24:51.220 --> 02:24:52.940]   You are great.
[02:24:52.940 --> 02:24:56.020]   This is the new app that you guys are going to invent.
[02:24:56.020 --> 02:24:57.020]   Yep.
[02:24:57.020 --> 02:24:58.660]   At some point we'll go there.
[02:24:58.660 --> 02:25:02.020]   But right now it'll just talk you to downstream where Julie and I talk about the business
[02:25:02.020 --> 02:25:03.020]   is dreaming.
[02:25:03.020 --> 02:25:04.020]   She's brilliant.
[02:25:04.020 --> 02:25:05.020]   You do so many podcasts.
[02:25:05.020 --> 02:25:06.140]   I didn't even know about this one.
[02:25:06.140 --> 02:25:07.660]   This is a fascinating subject.
[02:25:07.660 --> 02:25:09.060]   I will be listening.
[02:25:09.060 --> 02:25:14.660]   I'm just a conduit for for Julia's really incisive knowledge of this stuff.
[02:25:14.660 --> 02:25:18.420]   She works as an analyst at parent analytics, talking about what the demand for different
[02:25:18.420 --> 02:25:20.340]   streaming shows is.
[02:25:20.340 --> 02:25:22.740]   And she used to be the verge.
[02:25:22.740 --> 02:25:24.260]   And she's just so smart.
[02:25:24.260 --> 02:25:26.900]   And it was one of those things where I wanted to be you've done this before.
[02:25:26.900 --> 02:25:30.860]   And I know which is, oh, I found a brilliant person who should probably have a podcast.
[02:25:30.860 --> 02:25:33.220]   I'll just ask them questions and make the podcast happen.
[02:25:33.220 --> 02:25:35.220]   That's basically the story of Twit.
[02:25:35.220 --> 02:25:38.580]   To be honest with you, that's all I ever wanted to do.
[02:25:38.580 --> 02:25:44.340]   And I made Jason create a page for all of his podcasts because he does so many.
[02:25:44.340 --> 02:25:45.340]   True story.
[02:25:45.340 --> 02:25:46.340]   True story.
[02:25:46.340 --> 02:25:51.060]   If you get six colors.com/podcasts, you'll see all podcasts.
[02:25:51.060 --> 02:25:52.060]   Look at this.
[02:25:52.060 --> 02:25:53.060]   You're nuts.
[02:25:53.060 --> 02:25:54.060]   That's like 20 podcasts.
[02:25:54.060 --> 02:25:55.700]   And Lauren's got a few in there too.
[02:25:55.700 --> 02:25:57.940]   Yeah, it's mostly me.
[02:25:57.940 --> 02:25:59.340]   Busy, busy guy.
[02:25:59.340 --> 02:26:00.340]   Great to have you.
[02:26:00.340 --> 02:26:01.340]   All three of you.
[02:26:01.340 --> 02:26:04.180]   And thank you all of you for joining us.
[02:26:04.180 --> 02:26:06.520]   We do Twit on a Sunday evenings about 2 p.m.
[02:26:06.520 --> 02:26:10.420]   Pacific 5 p.m. Eastern 2100 UTC.
[02:26:10.420 --> 02:26:15.860]   I say that so you can watch it live if you want at live.twit.tv or listen live.
[02:26:15.860 --> 02:26:21.940]   If you're watching or listening live, do chat live with us at irc.twit.tv.
[02:26:21.940 --> 02:26:27.500]   And of course, club Twit members, you get a special chat platform just for you.
[02:26:27.500 --> 02:26:31.780]   For seven bucks a month, club Twit members get ad free versions of all the shows that
[02:26:31.780 --> 02:26:34.740]   takes about an hour out of every show.
[02:26:34.740 --> 02:26:36.540]   I know.
[02:26:36.540 --> 02:26:41.820]   You also get access to the great club Twit discord where the conversations are fantastic.
[02:26:41.820 --> 02:26:47.860]   Not just about the ongoing shows, but about every topic that a nerd could be into.
[02:26:47.860 --> 02:26:52.180]   And you also get the Twit Plus feed with stuff that doesn't make it to the podcasts.
[02:26:52.180 --> 02:26:54.100]   Seven bucks a month makes a big difference for us.
[02:26:54.100 --> 02:26:58.100]   It's kind of our way of getting ready for the Spotify onslaught.
[02:26:58.100 --> 02:27:04.140]   We figure if we can get a little subscription club going, maybe we have a chance of surviving
[02:27:04.140 --> 02:27:06.820]   twit.tv/clubtwit.
[02:27:06.820 --> 02:27:11.380]   If you want to know more, there are also annual plans and there's corporate memberships as
[02:27:11.380 --> 02:27:12.380]   well.
[02:27:12.380 --> 02:27:13.980]   Thank you in advance.
[02:27:13.980 --> 02:27:17.820]   We really appreciate the support we've been getting from our club Twit members.
[02:27:17.820 --> 02:27:20.980]   After the fact, of course, we still offer free versions of this show.
[02:27:20.980 --> 02:27:22.980]   Just go to our website, twit.tv.
[02:27:22.980 --> 02:27:25.620]   You'll find all the shows there.
[02:27:25.620 --> 02:27:27.500]   You can also find it on YouTube.
[02:27:27.500 --> 02:27:30.660]   Every show has its own dedicated YouTube channel.
[02:27:30.660 --> 02:27:35.860]   And I guess the easiest best thing to do would be find your favorite podcast player, pocket
[02:27:35.860 --> 02:27:42.140]   casts, overcast, Google or Apple's podcast player, whatever it is that you like and subscribe.
[02:27:42.140 --> 02:27:43.820]   And that way you get Twit automatically.
[02:27:43.820 --> 02:27:46.900]   The minute it's done, so you got it for the Monday morning commute.
[02:27:46.900 --> 02:27:48.900]   You don't have to think about it.
[02:27:48.900 --> 02:27:55.820]   Thank you everybody for being here and the words of the emoji of Jason Snell live long
[02:27:55.820 --> 02:27:56.820]   and prosper.
[02:27:56.820 --> 02:27:57.820]   We'll see you next time.
[02:27:57.820 --> 02:27:59.820]   Another Twit is in the can.
[02:27:59.820 --> 02:28:00.820]   Bye-bye everybody.
[02:28:00.820 --> 02:28:01.820]   This is amazing.
[02:28:01.820 --> 02:28:02.820]   Do the Twit.
[02:28:02.820 --> 02:28:03.820]   Do the Twit.
[02:28:03.820 --> 02:28:04.820]   All right.
[02:28:04.820 --> 02:28:05.820]   Do the Twit, baby.
[02:28:05.820 --> 02:28:06.820]   Do the Twit.
[02:28:06.820 --> 02:28:07.820]   All right.
[02:28:07.820 --> 02:28:08.820]   Do the Twit, baby.
[02:28:08.820 --> 02:28:09.820]   Do the Twit.
[02:28:09.820 --> 02:28:10.820]   All right.
[02:28:10.820 --> 02:28:11.820]   Do the Twit, baby.
[02:28:11.820 --> 02:28:12.820]   Do the Twit.
[02:28:12.820 --> 02:28:13.820]   Do the Twit.
