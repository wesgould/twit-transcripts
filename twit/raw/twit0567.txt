[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.800]   Thank you. You're not a father, I don't think.
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:20.800]   No, no.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:22.000]   Soon, maybe.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:22.600]   Soon.
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:24.600]   Really? Anything you want to share with the...
[00:02:24.600 --> 00:02:26.600]   No, no exclusive announcements.
[00:02:26.600 --> 00:02:27.600]   Oh, okay.
[00:02:27.600 --> 00:02:28.600]   It's just getting around that time.
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:29.600]   So I have to say...
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:32.600]   It is. You're that age. Do you have a young lady in mind or is it...
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.600]   I do, yeah. I'm married.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:34.600]   Okay.
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:36.600]   I've chosen somebody.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:38.600]   You have selected the partner.
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:42.600]   All right. Now it's just about... You know what happens next. You do know that process.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:44.600]   I've heard. I've heard stories.
[00:02:44.600 --> 00:02:45.600]   Yes. Yes.
[00:02:45.600 --> 00:02:47.600]   They tell stories.
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:53.600]   Also with us, great to have Georgia Dow once again from iMOR.com and Montreal.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:56.600]   Wonderful to see you. I hear you spent time with your dad today.
[00:02:56.600 --> 00:02:58.600]   I did. I did. It was wonderful.
[00:02:58.600 --> 00:02:59.600]   Nice.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:01.600]   Nice. That's wonderful.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.600]   And a father himself, O'Dokta, O'NjJ Stone.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:10.600]   AKA the best dad in land.
[00:03:10.600 --> 00:03:11.600]   I think you are.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:14.600]   He says, "My Superman cup does not focus in..."
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:15.600]   Wow.
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.600]   That's great.
[00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:18.600]   That's great.
[00:03:18.600 --> 00:03:19.600]   It says, "Have you found a day on it?"
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:20.600]   That's nice.
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:22.600]   It's got purple because she like purple and I don't.
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:23.600]   And then she signed on the bottom of the case.
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.600]   I guess see now to forget who made it for me.
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:26.600]   Who is your daughter?
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.600]   He says, "Well, I says right here on the bottom."
[00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:30.600]   Yeah.
[00:03:30.600 --> 00:03:33.600]   I mean, this is the last year though.
[00:03:33.600 --> 00:03:37.600]   I think this is the last year I'm accepting these crappy handmade...
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:42.600]   I made you a picture frame with no picture in it because I figured you can take all the pictures.
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.600]   You select your own picture presence.
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:46.600]   Next year, she better come with some good stuff.
[00:03:46.600 --> 00:03:49.600]   I think making you something is the highest...
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:50.600]   No, no.
[00:03:50.600 --> 00:03:51.600]   Let's just start the show.
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:52.600]   Let's get this clear.
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:57.600]   Mother's Day, we got reservations, parking lots of people, everything sold out.
[00:03:57.600 --> 00:04:00.600]   Father's Day, I'm sitting on TV with you, Uncle Leo.
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:01.600]   This is what happens on Father's Day.
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:04.600]   Father's Day, you gotta work and do stuff.
[00:04:04.600 --> 00:04:09.600]   Mother's Day they get to lounge and get to freak rubs and get books with I/O using it.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:12.600]   I mean, it's got Superman on it so I know she loves me.
[00:04:12.600 --> 00:04:13.600]   Yeah.
[00:04:13.600 --> 00:04:17.600]   And she got me, she gave me some pink Himalaya salt because we were over another friend's house.
[00:04:17.600 --> 00:04:18.600]   Oh, that's nice.
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.600]   What is that?
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.600]   It's a nice gift.
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.600]   Yeah.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.600]   It said that's pink salt and so for like 30 minutes I kept saying Himalaya, playa.
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:27.600]   So she got a pink salt.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:29.600]   This is the last year I'm accepting gifts like this.
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:31.600]   I know she's up there and she hears me.
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.600]   She better come with me.
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:34.600]   Laya, you need to come up with something.
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:36.600]   What do you, well, just help her out.
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:37.600]   What do you want?
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.600]   I want, I want what women get.
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.600]   I want reservations.
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.600]   I want what you want and die.
[00:04:41.600 --> 00:04:43.600]   Would you never get more women get?
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.600]   Unfortunately, that's not what happened.
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:46.600]   Death and you're switching.
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:47.600]   Money's out.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:48.600]   I'm in.
[00:04:48.600 --> 00:04:49.600]   I'm in a rebel.
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.600]   It's your change.
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:52.600]   I got a tie for Father's Day.
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:53.600]   It's a bow tie.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:54.600]   It's a clip on.
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:55.600]   That's it right there.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.600]   No, actually I did not get it.
[00:04:57.600 --> 00:04:58.600]   Father's Day, Uncle Leo.
[00:04:58.600 --> 00:04:59.600]   A text.
[00:04:59.600 --> 00:05:02.600]   Actually, I got a text and my daughter called me many times.
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:03.600]   Oh.
[00:05:03.600 --> 00:05:04.600]   Yeah.
[00:05:04.600 --> 00:05:05.600]   So that was-
[00:05:05.600 --> 00:05:06.600]   She met up for the sun.
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.600]   Yeah.
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.600]   Yeah.
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:10.600]   I think the girls do make up for the sun often.
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:14.600]   Abby's in Mexico, so we couldn't spend Father's Day together.
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:18.600]   She's studying whatever that language is in Mexico.
[00:05:18.600 --> 00:05:21.600]   I think she needs to work harder on it though because she said,
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:25.600]   "Happy Dia de las papas," which I think, if I'm not wrong,
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.600]   means the day of the potatoes.
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:30.600]   So it's good she's studying.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:32.600]   She's almost there.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:35.600]   She has her vegetables down.
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.600]   Her vegetables down.
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.600]   It was a big week.
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.600]   We got a lot to talk about.
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:44.600]   Where do you want to start?
[00:05:44.600 --> 00:05:45.600]   Should we start with www.dc?
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:46.600]   Yeah.
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:47.600]   Sure.
[00:05:47.600 --> 00:05:48.600]   Then we'll go to E3.
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:51.600]   There's a new phone from OnePlus.
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:55.600]   There's a victory in the net neutrality case.
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:56.600]   There's a lot to talk about.
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.600]   Let's start with www.dc.
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:06:01.600]   You did not get to go with the rest of the I'm-or crew, Georgia.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:04.600]   I was the only one that was left behind.
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:05.600]   God, don't feel bad.
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:09.600]   I don't mean to feel abandoned or anything, but no, no, no.
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:11.600]   Everyone else was there except for me.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:12.600]   Yeah.
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:13.600]   I'm a little heartbroken.
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:14.600]   It's okay.
[00:06:14.600 --> 00:06:15.600]   Wow.
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.600]   And he has no passive aggression towards me.
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:19.600]   At least they got invitations.
[00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.600]   I didn't even get invitations.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:24.600]   So you and I will sit back and we'll look at from afar.
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:27.600]   It was not, you know, and this, by the way, we should mention this
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.600]   because we spend weeks before any Apple event talking about the rumors.
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:34.600]   And in this case, there was a lot of rumored hardware.
[00:06:34.600 --> 00:06:38.200]   There was a rumor New Macbook Pro.
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:42.200]   There were rumors about what else.
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:43.200]   I don't remember.
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:44.200]   There were some other rumors.
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.600]   None of which came true.
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:48.600]   There were rumors that were going to completely rewrite iTunes.
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:49.600]   No.
[00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.600]   And instead it was all software.
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:57.600]   It was all about what really a developers conference keynote should be about.
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:06:59.600]   Updates to iOS, Mac OS.
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.600]   By the way, it's called Mac OS now.
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.600]   Not OS 10 Mac OS.
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:07.600]   Watch OS and TVOS.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.600]   And are you pretty excited?
[00:07:09.600 --> 00:07:11.600]   Oh, first let me see here.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.600]   Who uses a Mac?
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:13.600]   Oh, and you use a Mac?
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:14.600]   Yes, sir.
[00:07:14.600 --> 00:07:15.600]   Okay.
[00:07:15.600 --> 00:07:16.600]   Devindra?
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:17.600]   Yeah, use it for work.
[00:07:17.600 --> 00:07:19.600]   And I have a Windows PC at home.
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.600]   So I try to keep both going.
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:21.600]   Yeah.
[00:07:21.600 --> 00:07:22.600]   I mean, I use both.
[00:07:22.600 --> 00:07:27.600]   But I'm using Linux right now.
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:28.600]   But oh boy.
[00:07:28.600 --> 00:07:29.600]   Oh boy.
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:30.600]   Oh boy.
[00:07:30.600 --> 00:07:32.100]   Well, I'll tell you why.
[00:07:32.100 --> 00:07:33.340]   A couple of reasons.
[00:07:33.340 --> 00:07:36.960]   One obviously I was getting a little tired of Microsoft foisting Windows 10 on everybody
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:37.960]   and everything.
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.840]   I like Windows 10, but I felt like that was really rude.
[00:07:40.840 --> 00:07:42.000]   How rude.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.440]   And then yeah, germane to this conversation, I was looking at Apple thinking you don't
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.400]   care about desktop.
[00:07:47.400 --> 00:07:48.760]   You don't care about OS 10 anymore.
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.320]   You're all about the iPhone.
[00:07:50.320 --> 00:07:53.520]   And I was starting to get a little word and thinking, well, I mean, I may need to find
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:55.360]   a new kind of home.
[00:07:55.360 --> 00:07:58.000]   So I say you went to the first home.
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   But okay.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:01.040]   So I beg to differ.
[00:08:01.040 --> 00:08:03.560]   For one thing, I think open source is the future.
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:05.240]   Do you not agree?
[00:08:05.240 --> 00:08:06.240]   I don't know.
[00:08:06.240 --> 00:08:10.520]   It's funny, Leo, like in high school, I was watching you on the screen savers and all
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:12.320]   the shows like experimenting with Linux.
[00:08:12.320 --> 00:08:14.280]   So it is really it's funny.
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:17.080]   Like, I feel like we've been saying open source is the future for a while.
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:20.280]   It's very important for desktop platforms.
[00:08:20.280 --> 00:08:25.760]   I know we've seen like the value of having something, I don't know, stable with a lot
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:26.760]   of developer support.
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:28.280]   So both from Apple and Windows.
[00:08:28.280 --> 00:08:29.280]   Yeah.
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:30.280]   And that was the joke for years.
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:32.200]   This year's could be the year of Linux on the desktop.
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.200]   No, no, no, this year.
[00:08:33.200 --> 00:08:34.200]   This stuff.
[00:08:34.200 --> 00:08:35.200]   Yeah.
[00:08:35.200 --> 00:08:37.960]   And the truth is in the intervening years, Linux has won in many respects.
[00:08:37.960 --> 00:08:39.360]   Android, he is Linux.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:40.360]   Right.
[00:08:40.360 --> 00:08:41.360]   Right.
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:42.360]   Right.
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:45.680]   The Nexus was like some new mix, you know, OS 10 is based on BSD.
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:48.360]   It's a bit star when it's open source under the hood.
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:53.320]   The graphical layer on top is all proprietary Apple stuff.
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:57.640]   Most anytime you surf at, you know, half the sites, if not more that you're visiting are
[00:08:57.640 --> 00:08:59.440]   running Linux.
[00:08:59.440 --> 00:09:04.560]   So but here's what I do think that open source is the only sensible way forward.
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:09.400]   And I think this kind of comes back to also the crypto conversation that people have, which
[00:09:09.400 --> 00:09:15.040]   is how can you trust cryptography if you don't, if it's just some blob.
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:19.280]   And you know that the companies that make that blob are under intense pressure from governmental
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:23.480]   agencies to make the blob accessible to them.
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:27.440]   If you really want to use cryptography, if you really want to be private and secure,
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:33.400]   you can't trust a company, not that the companies are untrustworthy, but Apple, Microsoft, Google,
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:39.480]   Facebook have no legal standing to say no, frankly, or it's very hard for them to say
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:43.080]   no if asked in the appropriate way.
[00:09:43.080 --> 00:09:46.920]   I mean, that's why the Apple store was interesting because they did say no, but they would have
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:48.480]   lost.
[00:09:48.480 --> 00:09:52.720]   You know, very important to understand the San Bernardino phone case, they would have
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:57.720]   lost in the long run had the FBI not dropped it because they have no legal standing to
[00:09:57.720 --> 00:10:00.560]   say no, they have to agree there.
[00:10:00.560 --> 00:10:03.800]   You know, they have to go with the law.
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:08.240]   And so if you want privacy and security, you can't trust an individual company and you
[00:10:08.240 --> 00:10:13.040]   have to trust open source where you can or others can validate the source.
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.400]   So I always say use open source crypto.
[00:10:15.400 --> 00:10:20.440]   And I think in many ways, open source software is going to be the wave of the future partly
[00:10:20.440 --> 00:10:23.320]   because desktop operating systems don't matter as much anymore.
[00:10:23.320 --> 00:10:26.960]   The cloud doesn't care whether you're using Linux or OS 10 or Windows.
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.040]   Doesn't matter what you're using.
[00:10:30.040 --> 00:10:35.000]   When you say that it sounds correct and it is correct, but remember the rest of the
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:40.800]   world thinks of open source as like you said, all the operating systems and sites are built
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:41.800]   on top of it.
[00:10:41.800 --> 00:10:45.200]   They're all wearing dresses and makeup and they're all the pretty.
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:46.640]   Ellipstix on the pig.
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:47.640]   Yeah.
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:49.640]   You keep saying it like like regular people don't know.
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:54.400]   If I said Linux to the average person in America, they can be Windex.
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:55.400]   I agree.
[00:10:55.400 --> 00:10:56.800]   No, I agree.
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:10:57.960]   But nobody needs to know.
[00:10:57.960 --> 00:10:58.960]   That's exactly right.
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:10:59.960]   Nobody needs to.
[00:10:59.960 --> 00:11:00.960]   Yeah.
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:01.960]   Doesn't matter.
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.280]   As far as it's the way of the future is the way of the now and what we know because we're
[00:11:04.280 --> 00:11:06.360]   knowledgeable about the information.
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:10.800]   But I don't know like, you know, I'm with you, but just relax.
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:11.800]   Yeah.
[00:11:11.800 --> 00:11:14.120]   That's what everybody says.
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:17.120]   When people start talking about Linux, that's almost the universal reaction is I'm with
[00:11:17.120 --> 00:11:18.120]   you, but relax.
[00:11:18.120 --> 00:11:19.120]   Chill.
[00:11:19.120 --> 00:11:20.120]   Yeah.
[00:11:20.120 --> 00:11:24.000]   Like you said, you've been on this since the 80s and we understand, but calm down.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.680]   It's a great solution for some people, but I'm more concerned with what's like accessible
[00:11:28.680 --> 00:11:32.600]   to normal consumers, to what they can buy in stores.
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.440]   And yeah, it's rough.
[00:11:35.440 --> 00:11:38.240]   Well, increasingly I'm telling people to get Chromebooks.
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:42.720]   Notice that that's Linux, but Google does not say Linux because they don't want to scare
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:43.720]   people.
[00:11:43.720 --> 00:11:44.720]   It's Chrome.
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:45.720]   You like Chrome.
[00:11:45.720 --> 00:11:46.720]   Chrome OS is safe.
[00:11:46.720 --> 00:11:52.080]   You're under Google's own platform too, and you're getting just Google's web, or at least
[00:11:52.080 --> 00:11:56.280]   you're getting their stuff pushed to, but it's not a full-fledged computer that can
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:12:01.080]   do all sorts of other things, offline apps and stuff like that.
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:02.080]   I agree.
[00:12:02.080 --> 00:12:07.880]   I mean, I talk to normal people on the radio all the time, and that's my day job, right?
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:10.080]   Is that your only contact with normal people?
[00:12:10.080 --> 00:12:12.000]   That is in fact my only contact.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   It really is.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   It's only contact.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.080]   And I often wish I didn't have to do that, but I do.
[00:12:16.080 --> 00:12:20.120]   And I'm not going to add, well, I do say to them, you know, I try to educate them along
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:21.120]   these lines.
[00:12:21.120 --> 00:12:25.120]   But a lot of times people call me an 80-year-old woman, call me, today.
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:27.400]   And she says, "I want to scan everything."
[00:12:27.400 --> 00:12:28.400]   "Linux!"
[00:12:28.400 --> 00:12:34.840]   No, obviously that's the wrong answer for something that what I first try to do is talk
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:36.720]   about a scanning everything.
[00:12:36.720 --> 00:12:39.040]   She said, "No, I want to scan all my receipts.
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:40.560]   I want to scan all my documents.
[00:12:40.560 --> 00:12:41.560]   I want to scan everything."
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:43.080]   I said, "You know, that's kind of old school.
[00:12:43.080 --> 00:12:45.680]   Nobody really, your bank statements are going to come digitally.
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:47.280]   You don't have to have paper."
[00:12:47.280 --> 00:12:51.960]   You know, that was last decade people were scanning everything, right?
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:54.280]   She's out here spending that cash, Uncle Leo.
[00:12:54.280 --> 00:12:55.280]   That's not my job.
[00:12:55.280 --> 00:12:57.000]   My job is not to spend her cash.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.200]   No, she's spending her cash, meaning she's got a lot of receipts.
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:03.240]   She's not using her car for everything.
[00:13:03.240 --> 00:13:05.840]   She's out here writing these checks and using that cash.
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:08.640]   She old school, so she needs to scan her receipts.
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:09.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:13.040]   But if the bank will send you pictures of your checks, you know.
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:14.040]   That's true.
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:15.800]   I was telling her to take a photo with her phone.
[00:13:15.800 --> 00:13:16.800]   I did.
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:17.800]   I said it.
[00:13:17.800 --> 00:13:18.800]   That's exactly right.
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:19.800]   So, I'm going to take a photo, throw them out.
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:20.800]   You heard me?
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:21.800]   You heard me?
[00:13:21.800 --> 00:13:22.800]   You just knew that's what I would have said.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:27.920]   No, I was just assuming that's like the smartest way for someone to be able to get rid of paper,
[00:13:27.920 --> 00:13:29.640]   but the IRS comes knocking.
[00:13:29.640 --> 00:13:30.960]   They're not going to care about the paper.
[00:13:30.960 --> 00:13:32.960]   They still want to have the receipts.
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:33.960]   I don't know.
[00:13:33.960 --> 00:13:34.960]   They'll be in trouble.
[00:13:34.960 --> 00:13:36.720]   You really want to keep those for seven years.
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:39.360]   Like really, can't the IRS come at you for like any time?
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:41.200]   She could put them in a box.
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:44.440]   But she wanted some way of storing them digitally.
[00:13:44.440 --> 00:13:46.440]   I said, look, I did exactly what I said.
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:51.520]   Take a picture with your phone and then get Google Photos and have it stored on the file.
[00:13:51.520 --> 00:13:52.520]   Or even Evernote.
[00:13:52.520 --> 00:13:53.520]   Evernote is great.
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:54.520]   Evernote is great.
[00:13:54.520 --> 00:13:56.520]   I don't know if you want, because then you can search your receipts also.
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:13:57.520]   I should have thought.
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:13:58.520]   I didn't think Evernote, and you're great.
[00:13:58.520 --> 00:13:59.520]   That's ask your answer.
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:03.240]   It is my favorite expenses tool because expenses are the worst.
[00:14:03.240 --> 00:14:04.400]   So, it's the best way to collect them.
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:08.800]   Do you worry that Evernote is kind of a rocky foundation?
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:09.800]   Yeah.
[00:14:09.800 --> 00:14:10.800]   For sure.
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:11.800]   And who is it?
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:12.800]   Phil Libin stepping down.
[00:14:12.800 --> 00:14:13.800]   He left.
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:14.800]   Yep.
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:17.160]   Tons of reports about their trouble.
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.960]   They just haven't made much progress over the last few years.
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:22.560]   My entire workflow is based around Evernote.
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.040]   So I'd be very sad if they fell apart.
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:27.640]   But I look at their Mac app and their Windows apps.
[00:14:27.640 --> 00:14:29.480]   Nothing has really improved.
[00:14:29.480 --> 00:14:31.520]   Their web app is really nice now.
[00:14:31.520 --> 00:14:34.160]   But yeah, they haven't brought that forward to other platforms yet.
[00:14:34.160 --> 00:14:38.080]   Microsoft sees the writing on the wall because I remember just a few weeks ago, maybe a
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:45.160]   couple of months ago, they offered Evernote to one note converter.
[00:14:45.160 --> 00:14:47.640]   So they know people are looking for alternatives.
[00:14:47.640 --> 00:14:49.200]   Anyway, we started this.
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:54.560]   I was going to say, I was going to say I like to say that this conversation shows just how
[00:14:54.560 --> 00:14:58.680]   horribly boring and nobody cares about WDC because we started the conversation with
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:14:59.680]   that.
[00:14:59.680 --> 00:15:02.000]   And normally we get bashed as Apple fanboys.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:03.640]   That is going to get there.
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:04.640]   And it's going to get there.
[00:15:04.640 --> 00:15:07.560]   Totally went off to another world in Androids and Lennoxes.
[00:15:07.560 --> 00:15:12.120]   I started by asking you how many of you use Macs and then I confessed to using a Linux
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.480]   desktop today.
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:14.680]   And then of course, you're right.
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:15.680]   We completely forgot.
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:16.680]   So back to WWDC.
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:18.920]   I liked WWDC.
[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:21.560]   I thought I had a lot of stuff that I wanted.
[00:15:21.560 --> 00:15:23.280]   I got like the bells, the whistles.
[00:15:23.280 --> 00:15:26.560]   It was all pretty and fun and it's going to work better.
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:28.400]   Like it wasn't anything super exciting.
[00:15:28.400 --> 00:15:32.240]   It's not like getting a new Mac or, you know, getting a new phone unveiled.
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:36.920]   But besides that, I'm like, this is what I want to use for messages for.
[00:15:36.920 --> 00:15:37.920]   I want the trinkets.
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:41.640]   I'm the one that uses like Bitmoji and like annoys people with like pictures.
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:44.720]   I want to send everything in confetti.
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:45.720]   That's what I can't wait.
[00:15:45.720 --> 00:15:46.720]   I had to actually.
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:50.520]   I kind of pointed that out.
[00:15:50.520 --> 00:15:53.720]   I don't know why they spent so much time on messages, but that's in a great Apple tradition
[00:15:53.720 --> 00:15:56.520]   of picking an app like their cards app.
[00:15:56.520 --> 00:15:58.520]   Well, it's their Snapchat competitor.
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:15:59.520]   Well, that's why, right?
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:00.520]   I mean Snapchat.
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:01.520]   That's right.
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:04.200]   They're worried that the kids, but the kids are going to, this is not going to change any
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:05.200]   kids mind.
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:06.200]   They're going to still use Snapchat.
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:07.200]   This is for moms.
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:08.200]   It's Snapchat for moms.
[00:16:08.200 --> 00:16:09.200]   It's Snapchat for moms.
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:12.000]   This is for moms and dads.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   Come on.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.280]   I mean, I love George so much.
[00:16:15.280 --> 00:16:17.680]   And normally we are on the same brain wave.
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:19.680]   Apparently, this is wrong.
[00:16:19.680 --> 00:16:21.920]   This was like the biggest snooze fest.
[00:16:21.920 --> 00:16:25.480]   This was the first time I watched one of their presentations and I fully realized and got
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:29.400]   annoyed with, oh my God, they're talking to me like I'm a five year old child.
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:31.280]   They repeat themselves three times here.
[00:16:31.280 --> 00:16:33.000]   Let me tell you all the features of messaging.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:36.320]   Now, here's someone to show you everything I just showed you on the screen.
[00:16:36.320 --> 00:16:37.760]   They filled two hours.
[00:16:37.760 --> 00:16:41.120]   I'm like, what are you just, can we get to the next thing?
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:42.480]   It was horrible.
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:43.480]   We're going to get you.
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:45.240]   No, we're going to get you engaged.
[00:16:45.240 --> 00:16:46.800]   We're going to, I'm going to get you engaged.
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:47.800]   I'm going to get you engaged.
[00:16:47.800 --> 00:16:50.160]   I was, it was not new.
[00:16:50.160 --> 00:16:52.640]   We should have been watching this together because you'd been like, this is horrible.
[00:16:52.640 --> 00:16:54.640]   And I'm like, oh my God, bubbles.
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:55.640]   Oh my God.
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:16:56.640]   I'm getting handwriting.
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:16:58.920]   Oh yes, I can't wait for this.
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:01.000]   I can use handwriting on my watch.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.840]   I was like, I got almost everything that I was hoping for in bells and whistles except
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:09.200]   for having my watch face always beyond, which is ridiculous.
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:10.200]   I can't.
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:12.200]   I don't think the battery life will allow it.
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:13.200]   I don't care.
[00:17:13.200 --> 00:17:15.440]   I'm going to hand write on your watch.
[00:17:15.440 --> 00:17:17.240]   You are not going to hand write on your watch.
[00:17:17.240 --> 00:17:19.200]   It's not, no, no, you know what?
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.200]   It's not, it's not for us.
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:22.600]   It's for Chinese people.
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:23.600]   Seriously.
[00:17:23.600 --> 00:17:24.600]   It's hard.
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:25.600]   Yeah, it's hard.
[00:17:25.600 --> 00:17:26.600]   Seriously.
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:30.360]   They know that we're not going to a be.
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:31.720]   We're not going to do that.
[00:17:31.720 --> 00:17:35.160]   But if you're writing Chinese ideograms, that's much, much easier.
[00:17:35.160 --> 00:17:39.480]   And by the way, one character is a word.
[00:17:39.480 --> 00:17:43.000]   So it's efficient and it's a way to handle that problem.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:44.680]   So I think that's for the Chinese market.
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:46.800]   You see, and that's also for people in meetings.
[00:17:46.800 --> 00:17:48.880]   Sometimes the fast, quick replies are not the right ones.
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:51.160]   I need to say like, you know, don't you dare.
[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:53.920]   Like I want to be able to say that on my watch right now.
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:18:00.920]   You know, my husband buys another VR system or something.
[00:18:00.920 --> 00:18:01.920]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:02.920]   Totally insane.
[00:18:02.920 --> 00:18:07.080]   Actually, last time we talked, you were getting, you were getting which the Oculus was coming.
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:09.400]   I was getting, I was getting the HTC Vive.
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:10.400]   The Vive.
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:13.520]   And you gave up your office and your studio for the Vive room.
[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:14.520]   It did.
[00:18:14.520 --> 00:18:16.080]   How is the Vive room doing?
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:18.640]   Um, Owen, I'm sorry.
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:20.720]   I know you're going to be like, this is going to be another one.
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:22.520]   It's going to be an interesting.
[00:18:22.520 --> 00:18:23.520]   It's going to be a good one.
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:24.720]   I'm totally sold.
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:26.680]   It was well worth it.
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:34.400]   It was, I have people that have never played video games, try this out and blow their minds
[00:18:34.400 --> 00:18:35.400]   away.
[00:18:35.400 --> 00:18:39.840]   I have my, my six year old cousin who's never played a video game in their life say, how
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:40.840]   much is it?
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:43.120]   What kind of a room do I need to get?
[00:18:43.120 --> 00:18:45.560]   And they're like shooting things, using a bow and arrow.
[00:18:45.560 --> 00:18:47.360]   I was just playing paintball the other day.
[00:18:47.360 --> 00:18:49.640]   Battle Dome is one of the best games ever.
[00:18:49.640 --> 00:18:53.360]   It's what I'm doing all night, every night because I love paintball.
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:54.360]   This is great.
[00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:56.040]   You're just like shooting things, painting the area.
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:18:59.640]   It's like Halo and Splatoon stick stuck together in a game.
[00:18:59.640 --> 00:19:01.200]   It's a blast.
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.160]   So it was well worth it.
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:04.160]   I'm, I'm there.
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:05.160]   Sign me up.
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:08.800]   Here's my, this is the space pirate game.
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:10.760]   This is one of the games we play a lot.
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:12.160]   Space pirate trainer.
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:13.160]   So good.
[00:19:13.160 --> 00:19:14.160]   Space pirate trainer.
[00:19:14.160 --> 00:19:15.240]   It's really fun.
[00:19:15.240 --> 00:19:18.120]   You're just standing on a deck.
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:22.240]   And you're just shooting at incoming.
[00:19:22.240 --> 00:19:23.920]   You have a little shield which you hold behind.
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:25.200]   You can get it from behind you.
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:28.000]   And then it turns out two guns is better than one.
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   It's pretty cool.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   It's amazing.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:31.480]   It's a great game.
[00:19:31.480 --> 00:19:33.000]   It's like Galaga and 3D.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:36.680]   Yeah, I actually thought it was kind of like duck hunt.
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:39.080]   Anyway, it turns out that the.
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:41.280]   It's the box that shoots back.
[00:19:41.280 --> 00:19:42.680]   Right.
[00:19:42.680 --> 00:19:48.080]   The game mechanics aren't as important as the environment, which is cool.
[00:19:48.080 --> 00:19:49.080]   So, okay.
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:50.080]   Well, that's good.
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:51.960]   It's even like the graphics for battle dome.
[00:19:51.960 --> 00:19:53.320]   It's made by one developer.
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:55.680]   It's so much fun.
[00:19:55.680 --> 00:19:57.800]   It's probably one of the most popular games right now.
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:02.840]   And it's, it's just an absolute blast to play when we get Oculus, which I think it's
[00:20:02.840 --> 00:20:03.840]   already there.
[00:20:03.840 --> 00:20:04.840]   We just have to get it all set up.
[00:20:04.840 --> 00:20:08.480]   We're thinking like, how can we play together so we can play a game of paintball on the
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:12.360]   same screen and like someone's the painter and someone else is the shooter and we can't.
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:13.360]   It's, it's.
[00:20:13.360 --> 00:20:17.160]   You've got to buy, we've got to buy that warehouse that everybody can afford when they all buy
[00:20:17.160 --> 00:20:21.360]   their VRs and everybody's got money to move their room and make a whole new room.
[00:20:21.360 --> 00:20:25.000]   The vibe unlike the, the vibe unlike the rift.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:28.960]   You have to take what like a large space like 10 by 10 space.
[00:20:28.960 --> 00:20:30.360]   Again, five, five, five.
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:31.360]   Five by five.
[00:20:31.360 --> 00:20:33.400]   I understand is coming.
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:36.600]   But again, first of all, it's like when you date somebody for the first time, you think
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:37.600]   everything's great.
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:38.600]   Yeah, it's very much like that.
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:39.600]   Talk to me after six months.
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:43.000]   No, because I game all the time and things wear out second of all.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:44.720]   Again, all the time.
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:45.720]   You have not tried this yet.
[00:20:45.720 --> 00:20:49.400]   Okay, what I want is the next time you come on the show, I want you to at least try it.
[00:20:49.400 --> 00:20:50.400]   Try vibe.
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:51.400]   Don't try Oculus.
[00:20:51.400 --> 00:20:52.400]   It doesn't have the controllers.
[00:20:52.400 --> 00:20:55.640]   So it's like the games are better in the Oculus, I thought, but you're right.
[00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:57.160]   The vibe is a better experience.
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:58.160]   Huh?
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:59.160]   It's a better experience.
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:00.160]   You have to try it.
[00:21:00.160 --> 00:21:01.160]   It's still worth trying though.
[00:21:01.160 --> 00:21:02.640]   But you know what we're getting for?
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:05.160]   Oh, and the PS VR, the PlayStation.
[00:21:05.160 --> 00:21:07.160]   Yeah, that's the one we're on.
[00:21:07.160 --> 00:21:09.000]   No, I played it.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   It's fun.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   It's good.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   I have all three.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   It's fun.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   It's not as good.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   I kind of like doubled up.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:18.720]   Yes, again, I'm not dedicating a computer for games.
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:20.920]   Has five games on it.
[00:21:20.920 --> 00:21:25.560]   First of all, second of all, weren't we supposed to be talking about WWDC, which is so horrible?
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:26.560]   WWDC.
[00:21:26.560 --> 00:21:29.320]   All right, we're going to take a break and what is going on?
[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:30.920]   Regroup everybody.
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:32.480]   Stop thinking about fun stuff.
[00:21:32.480 --> 00:21:33.480]   Start thinking about WWDC.
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:34.480]   Okay.
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:35.480]   It's horrible.
[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:37.480]   We're going to talk about no, wait a minute.
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:40.360]   You can now call for help on your watch.
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:41.360]   That's life changing.
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:42.360]   We useful.
[00:21:42.360 --> 00:21:43.360]   Yeah.
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:44.920]   That's going to change everyone's lives.
[00:21:44.920 --> 00:21:49.240]   If you're in a wheelchair, Apple finally realized how insulting it was to tell you to
[00:21:49.240 --> 00:21:50.880]   stand up every hour.
[00:21:50.880 --> 00:21:52.380]   That was bad.
[00:21:52.380 --> 00:21:53.380]   That was bad.
[00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:55.960]   I didn't even think about it at the time, but then they mentioned it as you're right.
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:58.880]   That's like, wow, I wish I could.
[00:21:58.880 --> 00:22:03.360]   Thanks, Apple.
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:04.360]   Let's see what else.
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:06.480]   All right, well, we'll talk more.
[00:22:06.480 --> 00:22:11.040]   A lot of the most interesting stuff was stuff under the hood for developers.
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:13.000]   There's a new file system.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:18.440]   Siri is now programmable app developers finally have access to the hooks inside Siri.
[00:22:18.440 --> 00:22:22.400]   There's stuff that actually might make a difference, but we'll also talk about invisible
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:26.440]   text and three times bigger emojis.
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:29.760]   But first, a word about sleep.
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:31.200]   You are the sleep expert, Georgia.
[00:22:31.200 --> 00:22:40.120]   I know Georgia has actually done videos and better sleep at our anxiety-video site, anxiety-video.com.
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:42.760]   One way to sleep better, a better mattress.
[00:22:42.760 --> 00:22:43.760]   That's Casper.
[00:22:43.760 --> 00:22:45.100]   Casper mattresses.
[00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:51.160]   They are made in the US of A and ship direct to you from the factory, which eliminates
[00:22:51.160 --> 00:22:54.560]   a big markup for the mattress store.
[00:22:54.560 --> 00:22:56.840]   The mattress store is a broken idea.
[00:22:56.840 --> 00:22:57.840]   Let's face it.
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:22:59.280]   I know you think, well, I'm not going to buy a mattress.
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:00.280]   It's like an lie on it.
[00:23:00.280 --> 00:23:04.840]   But really, do you want to lie in the mattress store with broad daylight with the sales girls
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:07.120]   looking at you, got your shoes on?
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:08.120]   You can't curl up.
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:09.120]   You can't roll over.
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.280]   You can't drool.
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:13.080]   You need to have the mattress in your home.
[00:23:13.080 --> 00:23:14.520]   And Casper lets you do that.
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:18.920]   For 100 nights, Casper is amazing.
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:21.320]   They've reinvented the mattress business.
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:26.040]   Two kinds of technologies to give you exactly what you want in a mattress, which is support
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:30.560]   that gives you the right balance and sink.
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:33.800]   It's springy latex foam and supportive memory foam.
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:38.960]   Casper mattress is a 2016 Business Intelligence Group Innovation Award winner because they've
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:44.120]   just taken this business that really was stuck in the 50s and they've reinvented it.
[00:23:44.120 --> 00:23:51.240]   Now, when your Casper mattress comes in a surprisingly compact box, you open it up.
[00:23:51.240 --> 00:23:52.240]   By the way, it smells great.
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:54.400]   The minute you open it up, it breathes.
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:57.160]   Well, sometimes I think people worry that it's a memory foam.
[00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:58.640]   Maybe it's going to smell latex.
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:02.200]   No, no, it smells fresh.
[00:24:02.200 --> 00:24:05.560]   It's great for the hot weather that's coming our way to the cellar because it breathes.
[00:24:05.560 --> 00:24:06.720]   You will never sleep hot.
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:08.840]   We know that's another thing.
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:11.320]   People need to sleep cool.
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:14.600]   You could buy it online and there's no risk because if at any time in those first 100 nights
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:16.200]   you don't like it, you call them.
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:17.680]   They'll come and get it.
[00:24:17.680 --> 00:24:19.080]   I think they donated it to a charity.
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:21.000]   I don't think they'd actually ship it back to the factory.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:24.480]   They donated it to a charity and they refund you every penny.
[00:24:24.480 --> 00:24:27.960]   There's no risk, no fuss, no must.
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:28.960]   The price is amazing.
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:31.800]   It starts at $500 for a twin, but I'm going to get you.
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:33.360]   The LFO pillows, which are great as well.
[00:24:33.360 --> 00:24:34.360]   Oh, it's so comfy.
[00:24:34.360 --> 00:24:35.840]   I was just about to say, I have the pillow.
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:37.520]   I don't have the bed and the pillow is awesome.
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:38.520]   I have two of them.
[00:24:38.520 --> 00:24:42.280]   It would be clear that we're going to give you $50 off the mattress we are not going to
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:44.120]   give you $50 off the pillow.
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:47.000]   But if you want to buy a pillow, when you buy the mattress, get the $50 off and then
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   get some pillows.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:49.480]   I'm all in on the pillows.
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:50.480]   It's fully worth it.
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:51.760]   They're really comfy.
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:24:54.200]   You all have Casper mattresses and pillows?
[00:24:54.200 --> 00:24:55.200]   I do.
[00:24:55.200 --> 00:25:00.680]   Well, I have a Casper and a memory foam or a Casper mattress and another memory foam pillow.
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:01.680]   I don't know.
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:02.680]   They're not quite memory.
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:03.680]   I don't know.
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:04.680]   I wait.
[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:05.680]   I'm going to see about it.
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:06.680]   Renee's getting the pillows.
[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:08.840]   I'm going to squeeze out the pillows and see.
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:13.480]   As C.S., Casper let us jump on their mattress to try to test it out for one of our videos.
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:16.480]   They're really cool and really comfortable.
[00:25:16.480 --> 00:25:17.480]   They're really great.
[00:25:17.480 --> 00:25:20.160]   They're really nice mattresses.
[00:25:20.160 --> 00:25:22.960]   You can get it right now and get $50 off your mattress purchase.
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:25.120]   Not your pillow purchase, but your mattress purchase.
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:31.240]   If you go to Casper.com/twit, you have to use the promo code TWIT and some terms and
[00:25:31.240 --> 00:25:32.760]   conditions apply.
[00:25:32.760 --> 00:25:37.160]   The shipping is free and the returns are free in the US and Canada.
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:43.000]   It is a great, great mattress at a really good price because you don't have a showroom.
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.520]   Actually, I think they have a showroom or two like in New York and stuff.
[00:25:46.520 --> 00:25:48.280]   So I've been to their New York office.
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:49.280]   It's just a room.
[00:25:49.280 --> 00:25:50.280]   It's not a showroom.
[00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:53.600]   It's not even really a showroom, but you can go there and try that.
[00:25:53.600 --> 00:25:55.640]   Was it all padded with Casper mattresses?
[00:25:55.640 --> 00:25:56.640]   Oh, man.
[00:25:56.640 --> 00:25:58.280]   It's not even a showroom.
[00:25:58.280 --> 00:26:00.240]   That's what you need for your five room.
[00:26:00.240 --> 00:26:02.480]   You need Casper mattresses on the walls.
[00:26:02.480 --> 00:26:04.120]   Do you know what we have?
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:06.480]   We actually, I put down for my VIVE room.
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:07.480]   I do.
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:10.240]   I have like mats on the floor because some games you have to crawl or you might fall over.
[00:26:10.240 --> 00:26:13.960]   But it would be nice to have some Casper mattress on the sides of the walls because my walls
[00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:16.840]   all dented from being a little over exuberant.
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:21.840]   You need a Brazilian Jiu Jitsu game for VIVE.
[00:26:21.840 --> 00:26:22.840]   You know what?
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:24.400]   When they get, I tried a boxing game.
[00:26:24.400 --> 00:26:25.400]   Yeah?
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:26.240]   It was quite good.
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:27.240]   It was quite good.
[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:28.240]   Yeah.
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:29.240]   It's just new out.
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:30.240]   It was pretty exciting.
[00:26:30.240 --> 00:26:34.240]   I'm like, finally, my martial art training is coming in handy.
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:35.240]   Sweet.
[00:26:35.240 --> 00:26:36.760]   How tall are you, Georgia?
[00:26:36.760 --> 00:26:38.000]   I'm really short.
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:40.080]   Unlike half room size.
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:41.080]   You're halfling.
[00:26:41.080 --> 00:26:42.080]   Five foot three.
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:43.080]   Five foot three.
[00:26:43.080 --> 00:26:44.080]   I'm close.
[00:26:44.080 --> 00:26:45.080]   That's not that short.
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:46.080]   You're close.
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:47.080]   You're close.
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:48.080]   My mom's 4'11".
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:49.080]   She says she's a legal dwarf.
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:51.520]   But that's my mom.
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:53.640]   My mom is also 4'11".
[00:26:53.640 --> 00:26:54.640]   Yeah.
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:56.520]   And my dad is like 5'3".
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:26:57.520]   5'2", 5'3".
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:26:58.520]   Yeah.
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:00.400]   I come from little people.
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:01.400]   Yeah.
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:06.160]   But no, I'm just wondering because I think, well, there's a thing that's kind of amazing
[00:27:06.160 --> 00:27:08.560]   is that you're this powerhouse.
[00:27:08.560 --> 00:27:10.160]   Are you a, what's your belt?
[00:27:10.160 --> 00:27:12.640]   Are you a, I know you won championships in it.
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:16.240]   Yeah, no, I'm a blue belt in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:20.280]   And I haven't gone for any like the last championship that did.
[00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:23.240]   I haven't done a tournament since I busted my knee and went for knee surgery.
[00:27:23.240 --> 00:27:24.240]   Oh, yeah.
[00:27:24.240 --> 00:27:26.360]   But yeah, I was Canadian champion in Brazilian Jiu Jitsu.
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:27.360]   Okay.
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:28.360]   Okay.
[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:32.000]   So, you know, it's a powerhouse that you don't want to mess with it because she could kick
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   your butt.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.720]   Anyway, WWDC.
[00:27:36.720 --> 00:27:37.720]   Let's get back to that.
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:38.720]   Okay.
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:42.440]   I'm going to do this in an orderly fashion now.
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:48.040]   The next Mac OS will not be OS 10, it'll be Mac OS Sierra.
[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:52.280]   It will be, there's a developer edition coming out while the beta you can get now.
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:57.880]   And then there's a public beta that's next month for actually for all of this developer
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:04.400]   bits were available a day of and a public beta if you're adventurous next month and
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:08.440]   then the fall like September probably.
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:10.120]   It is not going to have the new file system.
[00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:13.720]   You can try it, but they don't recommend you do it because it's very, very early days.
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:19.080]   But there's a new file system APFS, which will be rolling out to all devices, not just
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:25.200]   Macs, but even the TVs, the watches, everything in the spring.
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:28.200]   I was very excited.
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:33.560]   Aaron Hilligas on the new screensabers yesterday, he is a developer, big nerd in ranch.
[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:36.800]   And I wanted to know about APFS, the new file system.
[00:28:36.800 --> 00:28:41.280]   Because it's very like a ZFS, which a lot of people say, well, here's the point.
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:46.840]   Apple's HFS file system is 30 years old.
[00:28:46.840 --> 00:28:49.120]   It is antiquated by any standard.
[00:28:49.120 --> 00:28:51.960]   It is not a modern file system.
[00:28:51.960 --> 00:28:55.160]   And ZFS, which is a much more modern file system, it's used with Solaris.
[00:28:55.160 --> 00:28:58.360]   Apple was considering incorporating ZFS.
[00:28:58.360 --> 00:28:59.760]   It's owned by Oracle now.
[00:28:59.760 --> 00:29:03.320]   But it was considering it a few years ago.
[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:07.120]   And then that whole thing just fell off the face of the earth.
[00:29:07.120 --> 00:29:09.800]   I think now we know why they were developing their own.
[00:29:09.800 --> 00:29:10.800]   It has snapshots.
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:15.720]   It's one of the chief benefits of ZFS is you can roll back, roll back, roll back.
[00:29:15.720 --> 00:29:16.720]   Anything goes wrong.
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:17.720]   You can roll back.
[00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:18.720]   You lose a file.
[00:29:18.720 --> 00:29:19.720]   You can roll back.
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:22.840]   It's a very effective and robust file system.
[00:29:22.840 --> 00:29:23.840]   It's faster.
[00:29:23.840 --> 00:29:25.760]   It handles large drives better.
[00:29:25.760 --> 00:29:27.600]   It handles SSDs better.
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.840]   So that is not the kind of thing.
[00:29:29.840 --> 00:29:31.040]   And they didn't even mention it on stage.
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:36.560]   It's not the kind of thing you can get people all excited about, not like fairy dust messages.
[00:29:36.560 --> 00:29:38.960]   But in fact, it makes a huge difference.
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:41.920]   Oh, doctor, are you excited now?
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:43.600]   I'm excited about that.
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:45.880]   And only really one other thing that happened.
[00:29:45.880 --> 00:29:46.880]   What?
[00:29:46.880 --> 00:29:48.200]   The Swift for iPad.
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:49.200]   Isn't that exciting?
[00:29:49.200 --> 00:29:50.200]   Yes.
[00:29:50.200 --> 00:29:51.200]   Okay.
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:52.320]   So it's super exciting for two reasons.
[00:29:52.320 --> 00:29:57.120]   You remember like last Christmas, I got Leah like the little bits and stuff like that.
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:29:58.120]   It's box.
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:29:59.800]   So little bits, little bits.
[00:29:59.800 --> 00:30:00.800]   Okay, little bits.
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:01.800]   Bit boxes cool too.
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:03.280]   Do you do you do you do your stocks with your kid?
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:04.640]   My kids do bits box.
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:05.640]   Yeah.
[00:30:05.640 --> 00:30:08.640]   So little bits was those magnetic circuits that you put together.
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:10.280]   We had their appetizer to put it together.
[00:30:10.280 --> 00:30:14.200]   So she loved those things and she made all kinds of cool stuff for a friend and she's
[00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:15.200]   deep into it.
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:16.680]   She knows she has been in Jewish grows up.
[00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:18.680]   And this summer we're going to be doing coding.
[00:30:18.680 --> 00:30:19.680]   Great.
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:20.680]   Because she has started to learn code.
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:25.160]   And I'm like, oh man, this is going to make it so I don't have to have her kill me in
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:28.920]   my sleep because it'll make it a little bit more fun because the way I was going to do
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:31.720]   it was not super easily fun.
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:32.720]   Do you code?
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:33.720]   You code Owen.
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:36.120]   Wait, Owen, that's why you got the cup.
[00:30:36.120 --> 00:30:37.120]   Just saying.
[00:30:37.120 --> 00:30:38.120]   A cup.
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:42.960]   So she can make it more fun if you want to get better gifts after.
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:48.560]   Oh, and next summer, app camp for girls.
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:50.080]   It's mostly West Coast though.
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:53.320]   Portland Seattle, Phoenix, Vancouver, Orange County.
[00:30:53.320 --> 00:30:54.760]   They do stuff in New York.
[00:30:54.760 --> 00:30:57.280]   There's a culprit as I've been looking at New York.
[00:30:57.280 --> 00:30:59.480]   This is a really cool project for girls.
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:04.080]   Your daughters age to get them coding and to show them it's more than just coding because
[00:31:04.080 --> 00:31:05.920]   there's design, there's art.
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:11.440]   There's a lot of a lot of different disciplines required in software and app development.
[00:31:11.440 --> 00:31:12.440]   And they make it fun.
[00:31:12.440 --> 00:31:16.760]   Yeah, Gene McDonald, a son of a little bit of a smile does a great job with this.
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:19.600]   I'm just going to give her a base and unless somebody else have fun with it.
[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:20.600]   But that's.
[00:31:20.600 --> 00:31:21.600]   So do you code?
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:22.600]   Are you a coder?
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:25.960]   I used to code and then I started paying other people to do it for me.
[00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:26.960]   Right.
[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:30.560]   So now I'm talking back into it for her because it's a horrible, terrible thing.
[00:31:30.560 --> 00:31:35.360]   I mean, when you watch on WWDC, like legit, like when the people in the crowd were crying
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:38.360]   and tearing up, I was like, I can't even be mad at them.
[00:31:38.360 --> 00:31:43.280]   Really the Apple seal fest, the or everything they say kind of annoys me.
[00:31:43.280 --> 00:31:47.760]   But like when they watched a little video of people learning to code and I can code now,
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:49.920]   everybody in that room knows how frustrating it is to code.
[00:31:49.920 --> 00:31:55.320]   So to see somebody happy to learn, to achieve, it is an emotional moment because it is a
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:58.000]   frustrating thing to learn and to do.
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:03.880]   This Swift Playgrounds isn't designed for you to write your next big app in, but it is
[00:32:03.880 --> 00:32:06.160]   designed to teach you a program.
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:09.440]   It will be free on the app store with the iOS 10.
[00:32:09.440 --> 00:32:14.600]   And what they've done, which is interesting is it's not that the drag module thing that
[00:32:14.600 --> 00:32:21.920]   so many others have done going back to, you know, scratch and Alice and stuff.
[00:32:21.920 --> 00:32:27.120]   This is, you're actually typing code, but there's, but it's beautiful puzzles and stuff.
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:29.840]   And I guess you'll learn all of the basics of Swift.
[00:32:29.840 --> 00:32:31.440]   It's a great starting point.
[00:32:31.440 --> 00:32:32.440]   Yeah.
[00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:36.240]   And it opens the door to people who have even ever thought about doing it.
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:37.240]   It's free.
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:39.760]   So if you ever see a lot about, I wanted to do it.
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:42.080]   You can at least jump into it, which is awesome.
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:43.920]   And I think that's a great thing that they did.
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:45.480]   Definitely be playing with it.
[00:32:45.480 --> 00:32:51.600]   My kids use BizBox, which you have to actually code into to learn a little bit of like basic
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:52.600]   Java.
[00:32:52.600 --> 00:32:55.920]   But I think that we're going to take a little breather and try out Swift Playground just to
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:32:58.560]   see how it goes because I think it's going to be a little bit fun.
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:00.920]   They have characters that are going to be moving around.
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:02.600]   So we're going to be testing it out as well.
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:06.960]   The key on all this is, you know, this looks like something that might be in a school curriculum,
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:13.240]   but really the idea is for a kid to kind of, I think, if you can help this stumble on it
[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:17.960]   and make it kind of their thing rather than something they have to do that this part of
[00:33:17.960 --> 00:33:20.080]   a curriculum, much more fun.
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:25.000]   At least that's how I discovered technology and I think probably all of you, it wasn't
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:27.960]   that somebody said, oh, now you have to learn this, but you stumble on it.
[00:33:27.960 --> 00:33:29.320]   It becomes fun.
[00:33:29.320 --> 00:33:30.320]   And this is your thing.
[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:32.200]   This is kind of good at this.
[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:33.200]   And this is a great opportunity.
[00:33:33.200 --> 00:33:36.120]   Just put it on the iPad and see if they find it.
[00:33:36.120 --> 00:33:41.520]   Well, again, the little bit's got Leah interested enough to where I sent her to one of my friends
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:42.520]   who was an engineer.
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:46.200]   He's retired, but he broke out the soldering board and was putting circus together.
[00:33:46.200 --> 00:33:47.200]   Oh, wow.
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:48.200]   And she actually cared.
[00:33:48.200 --> 00:33:49.200]   Oh, that's great.
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:53.160]   So going from clicking things together and having tools and watching smoke puff up and
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:55.280]   like she was totally into it last summer.
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:59.720]   So I'm like, I'm just going to progressively mind shift her along and to molding her into
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:02.440]   the greatest beast of all times.
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:07.480]   Now Apple is in an interesting position because Google at Google I/O announced that we're
[00:34:07.480 --> 00:34:09.040]   doubling down on machine learning.
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:13.920]   We're going to put machine learning in everything, your phone, which already knows a lot about
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:18.080]   you and Google, which already knows a lot about you is going to be able to predict where
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:20.320]   you're going, what you're doing and offer you help.
[00:34:20.320 --> 00:34:22.280]   And you're going to be able to ask questions of it.
[00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:30.240]   And Apple has, of course, resisted this, trying to position itself as a steward of its users'
[00:34:30.240 --> 00:34:38.240]   privacy and security, which makes it a little harder for them to do all of the cool things
[00:34:38.240 --> 00:34:41.680]   that Google and Facebook are doing because they're willing to spy on you.
[00:34:41.680 --> 00:34:45.000]   So Apple has responded, they did talk about machine learning.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:46.880]   They said, yes, we're going to be doing it.
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:52.120]   But there are two things Apple is going to do that they say is now again, this is marketing.
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:54.520]   So this is what they say is different.
[00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:56.960]   One is a lot of this will be done on the phone.
[00:34:56.960 --> 00:35:02.480]   So for instance, Apple debuted new features and photos, giving them parity, I think, with
[00:35:02.480 --> 00:35:07.440]   Google's photos, things like recognizing faces and recognizing subject matter and letting
[00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:12.960]   you search your photos for pictures of Paris in the springtime or whatever.
[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:16.960]   But they said, but we're going to do that on device.
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:19.680]   So we're not going to do the code in our cloud.
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:22.360]   We're not going to load your messages in the cloud.
[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:24.080]   We're going to do it on device.
[00:35:24.080 --> 00:35:30.120]   And the second thing they announced is this differential privacy, which is that a really
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:33.520]   interesting idea coming out of a university research.
[00:35:33.520 --> 00:35:37.720]   Wired's article is quite good from Mandy Greenberg describing this.
[00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:43.120]   But also our friend cryptographer Matthew Green, who really is the king of all this,
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:47.160]   wrote a blog post too about differential privacy.
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:50.120]   And he pointed out that it's one thing to say.
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:56.520]   He was said, first of all, it's great to see university research applied in this way that
[00:35:56.520 --> 00:35:59.360]   many, many people will be able to benefit from it.
[00:35:59.360 --> 00:36:06.720]   But he said differential privacy is very dependent on implementation.
[00:36:06.720 --> 00:36:13.960]   And there's really not, it's, until Apple says exactly what it's doing and shows us
[00:36:13.960 --> 00:36:18.160]   the code, we can't say whether they're doing it right, they're doing it well, or even whether
[00:36:18.160 --> 00:36:19.760]   it protects your privacy.
[00:36:19.760 --> 00:36:22.360]   In theory, it could.
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:26.440]   So, but I'm, I'm liking, actually, I want to ask you guys, now I'm starting with you
[00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:27.440]   Devindra.
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:31.360]   I'm liking the idea that Apple says we have a way forward machine learning that still
[00:36:31.360 --> 00:36:32.360]   protects your privacy.
[00:36:32.360 --> 00:36:33.360]   Yeah.
[00:36:33.360 --> 00:36:38.720]   It's a, I mean, it's a good way for Apple to differentiate itself from Google, especially
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:43.360]   on Facebook and honestly, every company that we were, we were worried, we're giving them
[00:36:43.360 --> 00:36:44.360]   too much information.
[00:36:44.360 --> 00:36:50.080]   And it seems like such an Apple solution to, I guess, like such like the way the iPhone
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:54.440]   was like not the first smartphone, but kind of a refined version of the smartphone.
[00:36:54.440 --> 00:37:00.080]   This seems like maybe a smarter way of dealing with computer learning going forward.
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:04.760]   But yeah, there's still a lot we need to see it right now feels a lot like marketing.
[00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:07.440]   I want to, I want to know exactly how this is working.
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:10.720]   There was, it was Craig Federighi kind of, yeah, it's working.
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:12.880]   It's going to be amazing and you're going to love it.
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:14.960]   It's magic.
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:19.600]   And, and what Matt Green says is, in fact, even I think he has a graph.
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:20.600]   Let me see.
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:26.960]   There's, yeah, it's probably not very helpful, but there's the graph, which is, yes, it's
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:27.960]   all clear.
[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:28.960]   I get it.
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:33.240]   Essentially they're knobs, they're knobs you turn and you turn it too much one way.
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:34.680]   You fuzz the data too much.
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:37.080]   You're not going to get enough information out of it.
[00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:40.040]   You're going to increase privacy without getting information out of it.
[00:37:40.040 --> 00:37:45.040]   You turn the knob too much the other way, you're fuzzing the data, but not sufficiently
[00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:47.920]   and privacy is compromised.
[00:37:47.920 --> 00:37:53.360]   And we know, and the reason this is important is we know that these data dumps actually
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:55.200]   turn out to be surprisingly revealing.
[00:37:55.200 --> 00:37:59.320]   You know, we've talked a lot about how metadata, you know, the FBI says, oh, don't worry.
[00:37:59.320 --> 00:38:00.720]   We're just using metadata.
[00:38:00.720 --> 00:38:03.080]   It can actually say a lot about you.
[00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:06.800]   Netflix dumped a few years ago a huge database.
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:11.360]   They say it had been anonymized in their attempt to get a better recommendation engine.
[00:38:11.360 --> 00:38:14.960]   They had a million dollar Netflix prize and they said, here's the data set.
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:20.800]   And some enterprising researcher took the anonymized data set and putting information
[00:38:20.800 --> 00:38:26.600]   together from other sources was able to identify the movies and individual people we're watching
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:28.040]   and liked.
[00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:31.640]   And so you can anonymize, but it doesn't have to be effective.
[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:37.320]   And so really the, bath green says, we just had, it just depends how well this is implemented.
[00:38:37.320 --> 00:38:40.600]   It could, it could be, it could be great.
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:42.160]   And it could be not so great.
[00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:45.640]   And it could just be, you know, they could wave their hands and say, oh, it's differential
[00:38:45.640 --> 00:38:46.640]   privacy.
[00:38:46.640 --> 00:38:49.560]   That by and of itself doesn't do anything.
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:55.280]   So if Apple is going to be doing this on phone, does that mean that we're finally going
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:57.600]   to get rid of this 16 gigabyte?
[00:38:57.600 --> 00:39:00.000]   Now no space can't do nothing on it phone?
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.280]   Because if you're going to do it on phone, we need a little bit more space because every
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:07.480]   mom that I know, all they do is cry and complain about how they can't do anything on their
[00:39:07.480 --> 00:39:08.480]   phones.
[00:39:08.480 --> 00:39:10.240]   And I'm like, well, there's a reason that phones are cheap.
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:13.280]   But Apple slick marketing and ripping people off stupidity.
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:17.800]   If you're going to be going to phone the first phone, better be a 32 gigabyte phone.
[00:39:17.800 --> 00:39:18.800]   At least.
[00:39:18.800 --> 00:39:19.800]   That's all I'm saying.
[00:39:19.800 --> 00:39:20.800]   At the very least.
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:22.800]   Didn't they do that with the SE?
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:25.280]   Didn't they eliminate the 16 gig version?
[00:39:25.280 --> 00:39:26.800]   I can't, I can't say for sure.
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:31.280]   Like as I mean, the 16 is still definitely the minimum for the 6S.
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:33.480]   I haven't seen about the.
[00:39:33.480 --> 00:39:37.160]   Maybe I was reading rumors about the next iPhone, the iPhone 7.
[00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:40.800]   Yeah, I saw some spec rumors and these are just rumors and nothing legit.
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:45.880]   But there were definitely some documents that showed that a 16 gigabyte version is still
[00:39:45.880 --> 00:39:47.680]   being worked on or being developed.
[00:39:47.680 --> 00:39:49.480]   And I really hope that's not the case.
[00:39:49.480 --> 00:39:52.920]   Like there's no excuse for Apple to do this in 2016.
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:59.320]   I've seen the arguments why and people have made very logical arguments for why it makes
[00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:04.000]   sense for Apple to have a low space iPhone because maybe not everybody fills up their
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   storage.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:07.640]   But yeah, it doesn't make sense today.
[00:40:07.640 --> 00:40:11.240]   Everybody's up their storage because you give them a 4K device.
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:12.240]   Yeah.
[00:40:12.240 --> 00:40:13.240]   It gets your 4K video.
[00:40:13.240 --> 00:40:14.240]   Exactly.
[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:17.040]   And they take one video of a puppy running their back yard for 30 seconds.
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:18.040]   You have no more space.
[00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:19.680]   I'll argue the other side though.
[00:40:19.680 --> 00:40:22.840]   It's nice to have a phone that is more affordable.
[00:40:22.840 --> 00:40:23.840]   It's not that much more affordable.
[00:40:23.840 --> 00:40:24.840]   Yeah.
[00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:25.840]   16 gigs.
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:27.840]   The price is nothing.
[00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:31.400]   You can up the price by 20 bucks and just stop it.
[00:40:31.400 --> 00:40:32.600]   There's no need.
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:35.320]   The cost is the barrier of cost is so low.
[00:40:35.320 --> 00:40:37.440]   It's just pure greed and evil.
[00:40:37.440 --> 00:40:42.960]   And in fact, it is true that Apple overcharges 100 bucks for an additional 16 gigs of memories
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:43.960]   and is ridiculous.
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:46.520]   Well, no, there's no more 32 gigabyte, right?
[00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:48.280]   You have to jump to 64.
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:51.760]   And that shows you the value of 64.
[00:40:51.760 --> 00:40:53.000]   But it doesn't make sense.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.640]   Yeah, if Apple kept the 16 gigabyte and made it 100 bucks cheaper or something, if it was
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:41:00.880]   actually below the premium of a typical iPhone, maybe fine.
[00:41:00.880 --> 00:41:01.880]   You can make an excuse for that.
[00:41:01.880 --> 00:41:04.680]   Nobody in this crowd would buy one.
[00:41:04.680 --> 00:41:06.960]   But there are people who don't install additional apps.
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:07.960]   In fact, the Vasti.
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:08.960]   Yeah.
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:12.520]   I'm telling you, I sit at soccer games with women all the time and they look at their phones
[00:41:12.520 --> 00:41:15.880]   and say, I can't take any more pictures of my kids because they got so many pictures.
[00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:16.880]   What do I do with the pictures?
[00:41:16.880 --> 00:41:18.240]   And I'm like, what do you have Amazon Prime?
[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:20.040]   Because if you do, you can unload your night.
[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:22.680]   I'm telling people this daily, weekly, monthly.
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:23.680]   It's very, very effective.
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:25.240]   I just send it to the cloud.
[00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:29.360]   But I think that people just don't understand how much space they don't even understand what
[00:41:29.360 --> 00:41:32.520]   takes up most space on their phone or how to even check it out.
[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:35.320]   And so because of that, they take one video, then they get angry at the phone.
[00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:36.320]   It's not really the phones fault.
[00:41:36.320 --> 00:41:38.320]   You shouldn't have bought the 16K.
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:40.120]   It's the marketing of Apple.
[00:41:40.120 --> 00:41:42.320]   It's it's it's it's it's the phones fault though.
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:44.960]   Yeah, Apple is selling a device with very limited memory.
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:46.560]   Yeah, you could send stuff to the cloud.
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:50.600]   But let's not pretend that managing your stuff on iCloud is easy.
[00:41:50.600 --> 00:41:52.720]   Where you like, I just jump into iCloud.
[00:41:52.720 --> 00:41:53.720]   It's insane.
[00:41:53.720 --> 00:41:55.400]   Yeah, it's not free.
[00:41:55.400 --> 00:41:56.400]   It's not free.
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:57.560]   And you have to pay more for it.
[00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:01.920]   It's one of those things that just seems really like I hate to say this, you know, too
[00:42:01.920 --> 00:42:04.440]   much these days because it seems like the thing people jump to.
[00:42:04.440 --> 00:42:10.720]   But I it feels like something that Steve's job, Jesus Steve Jobs Apple probably wouldn't
[00:42:10.720 --> 00:42:11.720]   do, right?
[00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:15.320]   This is a bad user experience that Apple's selling for its marquee product.
[00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:17.360]   I think Steve Jobs Apple would do this.
[00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:19.920]   I think Steve Jobs Apple did do this.
[00:42:19.920 --> 00:42:22.800]   Well, remember they sell eight gig iPhones.
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:24.720]   But that was a very good one.
[00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:26.640]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:27.960]   The megapixels were different.
[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:29.360]   The spaces were different.
[00:42:29.360 --> 00:42:32.360]   Now at the point where you're literally telling people, oh, you don't know anything about
[00:42:32.360 --> 00:42:34.840]   storage or kind of they put everything on Facebook.
[00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:38.040]   That's where they archive everything to have it save somewhere.
[00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:39.680]   Everybody puts everything on Facebook.
[00:42:39.680 --> 00:42:40.680]   Stop it Apple.
[00:42:40.680 --> 00:42:41.680]   I hate it.
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:42.680]   Fix it.
[00:42:42.680 --> 00:42:43.680]   Stop it.
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:46.240]   Progens are more important to Apple than user experience.
[00:42:46.240 --> 00:42:48.120]   And that is that's worrying to me.
[00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:51.520]   That's a sign of bigger problems coming down the line.
[00:42:51.520 --> 00:42:57.880]   I have to be very careful because I don't I think I'm overly negative on Apple partly
[00:42:57.880 --> 00:43:01.680]   because I feel it's like a I was jilted.
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:03.800]   And you know how what once.
[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:05.720]   Not because they didn't invite you to W.W.
[00:43:05.720 --> 00:43:07.240]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no,

[01:04:09.240 --> 01:04:12.240]   because I can always fire up the camera, then we can see each other.
[01:04:12.240 --> 01:04:15.240]   I can always fire up the screen sharing, then they can see what I'm seeing.
[01:04:15.240 --> 01:04:19.240]   I can show my PowerPoint, we can collaborate on documents.
[01:04:19.240 --> 01:04:22.240]   It lets you easily work and collaborate with clients and colleagues,
[01:04:22.240 --> 01:04:29.240]   no matter where they are, be a meeting MVP, all the day long with GoToMeeting
[01:04:29.240 --> 01:04:33.240]   and with teams and clients now spread out all over the globe.
[01:04:33.240 --> 01:04:38.240]   This is a must have. The nice thing is you can get going real fast for free
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:42.240]   by going to go to meeting.com. It works with your web camp,
[01:04:42.240 --> 01:04:45.240]   so you can see your colleagues and clients in high depth.
[01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:48.240]   Next, the best thing to being in the same room, it lets you share your screen,
[01:04:48.240 --> 01:04:52.240]   so you can share the same page. You can pass off presenter duties with ease,
[01:04:52.240 --> 01:04:58.240]   so you can take turns. You can even send private chats and video links behind the scenes.
[01:04:58.240 --> 01:05:03.240]   Couldn't be easier, more efficient and faster, and you can try it free for the next 30 days.
[01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:08.240]   Be the next meeting MVP at GoToMeeting.com.
[01:05:08.240 --> 01:05:12.240]   Just click on that orange button that says "try it free."
[01:05:12.240 --> 01:05:18.240]   Go to meeting. We love it.
[01:05:18.240 --> 01:05:23.240]   I think we've covered WWDC. We got it all right. Ready to go to E3?
[01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:27.240]   Wait a minute. I want a palette cleanser.
[01:05:27.240 --> 01:05:32.240]   In between the heavy courses here, let's have a little palette cleanser,
[01:05:32.240 --> 01:05:36.240]   a little something from 1+ called the 1+3.
[01:05:36.240 --> 01:05:38.240]   Devindra, you must have one, right?
[01:05:38.240 --> 01:05:42.240]   I don't have one. There's Chris Velasco in Gadget who reviewed it,
[01:05:42.240 --> 01:05:45.240]   but it's a nice looking phone. What can I say? It's what? 400 bucks?
[01:05:45.240 --> 01:05:47.240]   Well, that's what's called the high-end feature.
[01:05:47.240 --> 01:05:51.240]   Yeah, I'm pretty excited. I've ordered one for myself.
[01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:53.240]   We'll come until next week.
[01:05:53.240 --> 01:05:55.240]   Because I need something to put on the pile.
[01:05:55.240 --> 01:05:56.240]   You need it.
[01:05:56.240 --> 01:05:58.240]   This is how you're next.
[01:05:58.240 --> 01:06:00.240]   I don't know if it's the bunker.
[01:06:00.240 --> 01:06:02.240]   I don't know if it's the new one.
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:04.240]   We had Florence Ion on the new screensavers yesterday.
[01:06:04.240 --> 01:06:06.240]   She had a 1+3. She had it for a couple of weeks.
[01:06:06.240 --> 01:06:08.240]   She was reviewing it. Very impressed.
[01:06:08.240 --> 01:06:11.240]   All aluminum. It kind of looks like that HTC 10 aluminum body.
[01:06:11.240 --> 01:06:13.240]   Everything looks like the HTC Pro.
[01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:15.240]   I know. The iPhone does. Come on.
[01:06:15.240 --> 01:06:18.240]   It's thin. It does have that iPhone thinness.
[01:06:18.240 --> 01:06:21.240]   I know MKBHD was complaining.
[01:06:21.240 --> 01:06:23.240]   I agree with him. I don't disagree with him.
[01:06:23.240 --> 01:06:25.240]   The camera bump is so big.
[01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:27.240]   He said, "Don't make it so thin.
[01:06:27.240 --> 01:06:29.240]   Make it as big as the camera bump and have more battery."
[01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:31.240]   It is a smaller battery than last year.
[01:06:31.240 --> 01:06:33.240]   3,000 milliamp hours.
[01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:35.240]   Although I've seen a lot of reviews.
[01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:38.240]   Florence agreed that the battery life is decent.
[01:06:38.240 --> 01:06:40.240]   Right?
[01:06:40.240 --> 01:06:41.240]   As good as...
[01:06:41.240 --> 01:06:43.240]   How long is the battery life?
[01:06:43.240 --> 01:06:47.240]   People don't like to give numbers because everybody's mileage may vary.
[01:06:47.240 --> 01:06:49.240]   She says it's as good as the S7.
[01:06:49.240 --> 01:06:51.240]   Which is pretty good.
[01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:53.240]   She says it wasn't as good for her as the S7 Edge.
[01:06:53.240 --> 01:06:54.240]   Which is what I use.
[01:06:54.240 --> 01:06:57.240]   I would like to replace the S7 Edge.
[01:06:57.240 --> 01:07:00.240]   It's a more pure Google experience because they use Oxygen,
[01:07:00.240 --> 01:07:06.240]   which is a one-plus version of Android that is pretty close to stock Android.
[01:07:06.240 --> 01:07:09.240]   Snappy 8.20.
[01:07:09.240 --> 01:07:11.240]   One weird spec.
[01:07:11.240 --> 01:07:13.240]   They put six gigs of RAM in it.
[01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:22.240]   There's a little dispute over whether that six gigs even is necessary or is used.
[01:07:22.240 --> 01:07:26.240]   XTA developers say, as far as we can tell,
[01:07:26.240 --> 01:07:29.240]   because they're fairly aggressive about killing background apps,
[01:07:29.240 --> 01:07:31.240]   you never really get close to using six gigs of RAM.
[01:07:31.240 --> 01:07:36.240]   So it's more like a spec that they put in there that nobody's going to ever need.
[01:07:36.240 --> 01:07:37.240]   It sounds good though.
[01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:38.240]   It sounds good, doesn't it?
[01:07:38.240 --> 01:07:42.240]   When you do it comparison, you're like, "Oh, they got six up in there.
[01:07:42.240 --> 01:07:53.240]   It may be useful for Android VR down the line."
[01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:57.240]   But this would not be a good choice for VR because it's a 1080p screen.
[01:07:57.240 --> 01:08:00.240]   So lower-rescreen means not so good for VR.
[01:08:00.240 --> 01:08:02.240]   They call it an optic AMOLED.
[01:08:02.240 --> 01:08:03.240]   There's AMOLED.
[01:08:03.240 --> 01:08:04.240]   Pentile though.
[01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:09.240]   So it's not as good as the Super AMOLED that Samsung has the best screens.
[01:08:09.240 --> 01:08:12.240]   Samsung owns these screens.
[01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:15.240]   They've locked in the market.
[01:08:15.240 --> 01:08:20.240]   The thing about true VR too is that I've talked to the Oculus folks.
[01:08:20.240 --> 01:08:25.240]   You need an OLED mobile screen to do VR right.
[01:08:25.240 --> 01:08:28.240]   So that's one thing, even the iPhone right now,
[01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:31.240]   you can have some 360 degree experiences,
[01:08:31.240 --> 01:08:34.240]   but you can't have even something like the Samsung Gear VR at this point.
[01:08:34.240 --> 01:08:35.240]   Why do you need OLED?
[01:08:35.240 --> 01:08:40.240]   It's because of the way the response time is just much lower.
[01:08:40.240 --> 01:08:42.240]   Latency is everything on these.
[01:08:42.240 --> 01:08:43.240]   That's what makes people...
[01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:44.240]   Exactly.
[01:08:44.240 --> 01:08:45.240]   It'll make you sick.
[01:08:45.240 --> 01:08:46.240]   It'll make you sick, unfortunately,
[01:08:46.240 --> 01:08:49.240]   for VR experience if you don't have it.
[01:08:49.240 --> 01:08:53.240]   Have you noticed that when you use cardboard on your iPhone, Georgia,
[01:08:53.240 --> 01:08:55.240]   that makes you more queasy than...
[01:08:55.240 --> 01:08:56.240]   Yeah.
[01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:59.240]   The latency is something that you want to,
[01:08:59.240 --> 01:09:02.240]   and it's also just like, if you see it becomes pixelized,
[01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:04.240]   you're not going to feel as comfortable while you're using it.
[01:09:04.240 --> 01:09:09.240]   I think that that's the thing, is that even when, at one point on the Vive,
[01:09:09.240 --> 01:09:12.240]   the floor moved at a different...
[01:09:12.240 --> 01:09:16.240]   When I wasn't moving, I had something downloading on my computer at the same time,
[01:09:16.240 --> 01:09:18.240]   and I was like, "Well, I have to sit down."
[01:09:18.240 --> 01:09:21.240]   So if you have a bad VR experience, you're never going to go back to it.
[01:09:21.240 --> 01:09:26.240]   So it's better to have a screen that's going to be able to really not give you a latency
[01:09:26.240 --> 01:09:30.240]   and also to be able to see things really smoothly.
[01:09:30.240 --> 01:09:35.240]   So don't buy this and hope to use it with Google Cardboard or VR Visor.
[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:38.240]   It does do some interesting things with power.
[01:09:38.240 --> 01:09:40.240]   They have something called dash charge.
[01:09:40.240 --> 01:09:43.240]   It requires a proprietary adapter.
[01:09:43.240 --> 01:09:45.240]   You have to use their adapter.
[01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:49.240]   But according to specs and, in fact, to Florence,
[01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:52.240]   60% charge in just half an hour.
[01:09:52.240 --> 01:09:53.240]   That's amazing.
[01:09:53.240 --> 01:09:56.240]   Yeah, in fact, one reviewer, I can't remember in a gadget,
[01:09:56.240 --> 01:09:58.240]   said, "This changes how I think about charging my phone.
[01:09:58.240 --> 01:10:00.240]   I don't even charge it overnight.
[01:10:00.240 --> 01:10:03.240]   I just charge it at meal, like for breakfast or something,
[01:10:03.240 --> 01:10:05.240]   because it charges up so fast.
[01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:08.240]   Fast fingerprint reader, I was very impressed with that.
[01:10:08.240 --> 01:10:09.240]   It feels very snappy.
[01:10:09.240 --> 01:10:11.240]   It's a very fast phone.
[01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:13.240]   The screen color is good.
[01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:14.240]   Do you need it, Leo?
[01:10:14.240 --> 01:10:15.240]   Or you just want to leave all the people?
[01:10:15.240 --> 01:10:16.240]   Oh, I don't need anything.
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:17.240]   I just buy them because I want to review them.
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:18.240]   Oh, no, no, no.
[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:19.240]   But that's my job.
[01:10:19.240 --> 01:10:20.240]   I need it.
[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:21.240]   No, no, no, that's my job.
[01:10:21.240 --> 01:10:22.240]   I need to review them.
[01:10:22.240 --> 01:10:24.240]   And I could have called one plus and said, "Hey, we need to review unit."
[01:10:24.240 --> 01:10:26.240]   But I don't want to be called back.
[01:10:26.240 --> 01:10:28.240]   He's the Bernie Sanders attack.
[01:10:28.240 --> 01:10:30.240]   He's not going to be persuaded by gifts.
[01:10:30.240 --> 01:10:32.240]   He's going to spend his cold, hard buckles.
[01:10:32.240 --> 01:10:36.240]   I want to tell you, I do not have to call.
[01:10:36.240 --> 01:10:38.240]   I buy every--
[01:10:38.240 --> 01:10:40.240]   What is with the jacket?
[01:10:40.240 --> 01:10:41.240]   What is that?
[01:10:41.240 --> 01:10:43.240]   You're about to be that old, too.
[01:10:43.240 --> 01:10:46.240]   You're right.
[01:10:46.240 --> 01:10:48.240]   Soon I'll be walking around.
[01:10:48.240 --> 01:10:49.240]   You gave away my inheritance.
[01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:53.240]   You are on the hot seat for the rest of this day.
[01:10:53.240 --> 01:10:55.240]   That was your inheritance?
[01:10:55.240 --> 01:10:58.240]   You don't know what kind of mint I could have made off.
[01:10:58.240 --> 01:11:03.240]   I mean, you don't know the sentimental value to my heart.
[01:11:03.240 --> 01:11:04.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:04.240 --> 01:11:05.240]   There you go.
[01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:06.240]   I got it.
[01:11:06.240 --> 01:11:07.240]   You don't understand.
[01:11:07.240 --> 01:11:08.240]   You sound like my son right about now.
[01:11:08.240 --> 01:11:09.240]   That's why he's sending text messages.
[01:11:09.240 --> 01:11:12.240]   Now, I know what's going on over here.
[01:11:12.240 --> 01:11:13.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:13.240 --> 01:11:14.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:14.240 --> 01:11:15.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:15.240 --> 01:11:16.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:16.240 --> 01:11:17.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:17.240 --> 01:11:18.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:18.240 --> 01:11:19.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:19.240 --> 01:11:20.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:20.240 --> 01:11:21.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:21.240 --> 01:11:22.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:23.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:23.240 --> 01:11:25.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:25.240 --> 01:11:26.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:26.240 --> 01:11:27.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:27.240 --> 01:11:28.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:28.240 --> 01:11:29.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:29.240 --> 01:11:30.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:30.240 --> 01:11:31.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:31.240 --> 01:11:32.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:32.240 --> 01:11:33.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:33.240 --> 01:11:34.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:34.240 --> 01:11:35.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:35.240 --> 01:11:36.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:36.240 --> 01:11:37.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:37.240 --> 01:11:38.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:39.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:40.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:41.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:42.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:43.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:44.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:44.240 --> 01:11:45.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:45.240 --> 01:11:46.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:47.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:47.240 --> 01:11:48.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:48.240 --> 01:11:49.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:49.240 --> 01:11:50.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:50.240 --> 01:11:51.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:51.240 --> 01:11:52.240]   Yeah.
[01:11:52.240 --> 01:11:53.240]   Yeah.

[01:45:49.240 --> 01:45:50.240]   Videos.
[01:45:50.240 --> 01:45:59.240]   And as long as we're plugging away, divindra, harder wars at Engadget, what are you working
[01:45:59.240 --> 01:46:00.240]   on?
[01:46:00.240 --> 01:46:02.240]   Oh, I've less about forget slash film.
[01:46:02.240 --> 01:46:03.240]   And slash film.
[01:46:03.240 --> 01:46:05.240]   Yeah, I do the slash film cast podcast at slash film.com.
[01:46:05.240 --> 01:46:06.240]   Love slash film.
[01:46:06.240 --> 01:46:07.240]   Thanks.
[01:46:07.240 --> 01:46:08.240]   It's great.
[01:46:08.240 --> 01:46:13.240]   I'm just going to look and see what the most recent, oh, sad, we should mention.
[01:46:13.240 --> 01:46:17.240]   Anton Yelchin, who plays the wonderfully played check off.
[01:46:17.240 --> 01:46:19.240]   Young guy was only 27, right?
[01:46:19.240 --> 01:46:20.240]   Yeah.
[01:46:20.240 --> 01:46:24.240]   He died yesterday or today.
[01:46:24.240 --> 01:46:27.240]   He was killed Sunday morning in a car crash.
[01:46:27.240 --> 01:46:31.240]   His car rolled over him or something.
[01:46:31.240 --> 01:46:32.240]   It was not good.
[01:46:32.240 --> 01:46:33.240]   Pind him.
[01:46:33.240 --> 01:46:34.240]   Pind him.
[01:46:34.240 --> 01:46:41.640]   So he was so good and the new, the reboot, the Star Trek reboot is very sad, very sad.
[01:46:41.640 --> 01:46:44.360]   But that's not what, that's not all the slash film was about.
[01:46:44.360 --> 01:46:50.040]   You also have great podcasts about movies and what movie, what summer blockbuster are
[01:46:50.040 --> 01:46:54.400]   you most excited about divindra?
[01:46:54.400 --> 01:46:55.400]   Finding Dory.
[01:46:55.400 --> 01:46:56.400]   Oh, we lost him.
[01:46:56.400 --> 01:46:58.800]   I'm excited about finding Dory.
[01:46:58.800 --> 01:47:01.200]   Well, you've got little kids.
[01:47:01.200 --> 01:47:02.200]   You got to go see that.
[01:47:02.200 --> 01:47:03.640]   No, that's not about the kids.
[01:47:03.640 --> 01:47:04.640]   That's about me.
[01:47:04.640 --> 01:47:06.880]   I can't wait to see the octopus character.
[01:47:06.880 --> 01:47:07.880]   He looks adorable.
[01:47:07.880 --> 01:47:08.880]   On East Sassy.
[01:47:08.880 --> 01:47:09.880]   Yeah.
[01:47:09.880 --> 01:47:10.880]   Hold on a second.
[01:47:10.880 --> 01:47:12.400]   Where's my thing at?
[01:47:12.400 --> 01:47:13.880]   Leah just went and saw it yesterday.
[01:47:13.880 --> 01:47:14.880]   Did she?
[01:47:14.880 --> 01:47:15.880]   Did she like it?
[01:47:15.880 --> 01:47:16.880]   Hold on.
[01:47:16.880 --> 01:47:17.880]   And?
[01:47:17.880 --> 01:47:20.880]   Oh, you muted yourself.
[01:47:20.880 --> 01:47:22.880]   So you would.
[01:47:22.880 --> 01:47:23.880]   I did because I shrieked.
[01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:24.880]   Yeah.
[01:47:24.880 --> 01:47:25.880]   Good job.
[01:47:25.880 --> 01:47:26.880]   Right now.
[01:47:26.880 --> 01:47:29.640]   We know we got the, we got the system.
[01:47:29.640 --> 01:47:30.880]   I say her name.
[01:47:30.880 --> 01:47:32.960]   If I don't say anything else, she shows up in front of me.
[01:47:32.960 --> 01:47:35.920]   If I needed to do something like that, then I tell her to do it.
[01:47:35.920 --> 01:47:36.920]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:47:36.920 --> 01:47:37.920]   If I don't say anything, then she comes.
[01:47:37.920 --> 01:47:39.760]   So you kind of figured it all out.
[01:47:39.760 --> 01:47:40.760]   Love it.
[01:47:40.760 --> 01:47:42.200]   We can watch our rated movies together.
[01:47:42.200 --> 01:47:44.680]   If I touch her knee, she closes her eye.
[01:47:44.680 --> 01:47:47.640]   If I touch her hand, she pulls her ears and her eyes.
[01:47:47.640 --> 01:47:51.120]   And then I tap her when she can open her eyes again so we can watch fun things together
[01:47:51.120 --> 01:47:52.120]   like Deadpool.
[01:47:52.120 --> 01:47:53.120]   I just jump up.
[01:47:53.120 --> 01:47:54.120]   There she is.
[01:47:54.120 --> 01:47:55.120]   It worked.
[01:47:55.120 --> 01:47:56.120]   My God.
[01:47:56.120 --> 01:47:58.240]   I was like saying, "Petle juice, petle juice, petle juice."
[01:47:58.240 --> 01:47:59.240]   And boom.
[01:47:59.240 --> 01:48:02.440]   You got to give her like any of the headphones for a second.
[01:48:02.440 --> 01:48:05.040]   And now talking to that.
[01:48:05.040 --> 01:48:06.040]   Did you like it?
[01:48:06.040 --> 01:48:07.040]   Yes.
[01:48:07.040 --> 01:48:08.960]   What did you like about it?
[01:48:08.960 --> 01:48:14.480]   I like that she at least found her parents.
[01:48:14.480 --> 01:48:16.640]   Oh, spoiler.
[01:48:16.640 --> 01:48:19.040]   Now who's your favorite character?
[01:48:19.040 --> 01:48:21.240]   What did you like about it?
[01:48:21.240 --> 01:48:31.880]   I didn't like how everybody was starting to get upset and everybody was annoying.
[01:48:31.880 --> 01:48:34.560]   And they were just like, "No, this is them."
[01:48:34.560 --> 01:48:35.560]   I hate it when that happens.
[01:48:35.560 --> 01:48:38.760]   That's kind of a SpongeBob thing where they all yell at each other.
[01:48:38.760 --> 01:48:39.960]   That's what I wanted to say.
[01:48:39.960 --> 01:48:41.400]   She was annoyed at the movie.
[01:48:41.400 --> 01:48:43.840]   She was like, "Everybody in the movie is so annoying."
[01:48:43.840 --> 01:48:48.400]   I'm like, "Oh, you might be getting a little too old for cartoon movies."
[01:48:48.400 --> 01:48:49.400]   She loves Zootopia.
[01:48:49.400 --> 01:48:51.120]   And she's like, "It's not like Zootopia.
[01:48:51.120 --> 01:48:52.720]   I was like, "Well, Zootopia is like a great..."
[01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:53.720]   Should I see Zootopia?
[01:48:53.720 --> 01:48:55.640]   Oh, you haven't seen Zootopia?
[01:48:55.640 --> 01:48:59.000]   No, because you know it's animated and I'm not sure if it's a kid movie or not.
[01:48:59.000 --> 01:49:06.960]   Zootopia is an adult full-on societal, great, awesome movie.
[01:49:06.960 --> 01:49:07.960]   It's a 10 out of 10.
[01:49:07.960 --> 01:49:08.960]   It's a 10 out of 10.
[01:49:08.960 --> 01:49:09.960]   It's amazing.
[01:49:09.960 --> 01:49:10.960]   That was good.
[01:49:10.960 --> 01:49:11.960]   We'll watch it.
[01:49:11.960 --> 01:49:12.960]   Do you know Zootopia either?
[01:49:12.960 --> 01:49:13.960]   No, I thought it was...
[01:49:13.960 --> 01:49:14.960]   I don't know.
[01:49:14.960 --> 01:49:15.960]   I don't know.
[01:49:15.960 --> 01:49:16.960]   I don't know.
[01:49:16.960 --> 01:49:17.960]   It's trailer was bad.
[01:49:17.960 --> 01:49:18.960]   It was trailer was bad.
[01:49:18.960 --> 01:49:19.960]   I don't know.
[01:49:19.960 --> 01:49:27.440]   There was one trailer that was just like a joke at the DMV.
[01:49:27.440 --> 01:49:28.440]   Yeah, that prolonged...
[01:49:28.440 --> 01:49:29.440]   I do want...
[01:49:29.440 --> 01:49:31.440]   That made me not want to see the movie.
[01:49:31.440 --> 01:49:32.440]   Oh, so good.
[01:49:32.440 --> 01:49:33.440]   The movie is great.
[01:49:33.440 --> 01:49:34.440]   It's really great.
[01:49:34.440 --> 01:49:35.440]   It's a really great...
[01:49:35.440 --> 01:49:36.440]   The last bit of the conversation.
[01:49:36.440 --> 01:49:37.440]   But yeah.
[01:49:37.440 --> 01:49:38.440]   It's a great movie.
[01:49:38.440 --> 01:49:39.440]   It's just...
[01:49:39.440 --> 01:49:40.440]   It's a societal...
[01:49:40.440 --> 01:49:41.440]   It's about sexism, feminism, racism.
[01:49:41.440 --> 01:49:44.080]   Like it's got all the isms.
[01:49:44.080 --> 01:49:46.640]   My favorite part of the movie is not in a show and I'm a spoiler for you.
[01:49:46.640 --> 01:49:49.400]   You know, she's trying to get the Fox to do something.
[01:49:49.400 --> 01:49:50.720]   And the Fox is like, "You're a rabbit.
[01:49:50.720 --> 01:49:51.720]   I'm a Fox.
[01:49:51.720 --> 01:49:52.720]   I'm smarter than you."
[01:49:52.720 --> 01:49:53.720]   Basically, like, "You're a woman.
[01:49:53.720 --> 01:49:54.720]   You can't trick me to do nothing."
[01:49:54.720 --> 01:49:55.720]   Oh, interesting.
[01:49:55.720 --> 01:49:56.720]   So, I make all this money.
[01:49:56.720 --> 01:49:57.720]   I'm doing.
[01:49:57.720 --> 01:50:00.880]   She comes back the next day and she's like, "Oh, well, I couldn't get you on a crime,
[01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:02.040]   but I got you on tax evasion."
[01:50:02.040 --> 01:50:03.040]   He's like, "What?"
[01:50:03.040 --> 01:50:05.000]   She's like, "Well, yesterday you told me about how much money you've been making since
[01:50:05.000 --> 01:50:06.680]   you were 13 and nobody could ever stop you.
[01:50:06.680 --> 01:50:09.040]   And I'm just wondering if you paid taxes since you were 13.
[01:50:09.040 --> 01:50:10.040]   Oh my God.
[01:50:10.040 --> 01:50:12.760]   Since you haven't, you can either help me or I want to turn you into the IRS."
[01:50:12.760 --> 01:50:13.760]   And I'm like, "Ooh!"
[01:50:13.760 --> 01:50:14.760]   Never mess with a woman.
[01:50:14.760 --> 01:50:15.760]   Never.
[01:50:15.760 --> 01:50:16.760]   God, I know you don't mess with a woman.
[01:50:16.760 --> 01:50:17.760]   Yeah.
[01:50:17.760 --> 01:50:18.760]   Especially when they talk about money.
[01:50:18.760 --> 01:50:19.760]   Lord knows.
[01:50:19.760 --> 01:50:20.760]   Great movie.
[01:50:20.760 --> 01:50:21.760]   So, your daughter is...
[01:50:21.760 --> 01:50:22.760]   You missed a window.
[01:50:22.760 --> 01:50:23.760]   The sweetest little girl.
[01:50:23.760 --> 01:50:25.400]   Oh, Dr.
[01:50:25.400 --> 01:50:28.280]   Jesus' daughter did a movie review on Finding Dory.
[01:50:28.280 --> 01:50:29.280]   She didn't like it.
[01:50:29.280 --> 01:50:31.320]   That's why she was struggling to say something nice.
[01:50:31.320 --> 01:50:32.320]   I know.
[01:50:32.320 --> 01:50:33.320]   She was so adorable.
[01:50:33.320 --> 01:50:34.320]   I think someone heard to say something nice.
[01:50:34.320 --> 01:50:35.320]   And man, is she a beauty?
[01:50:35.320 --> 01:50:36.320]   That's so cute.
[01:50:36.320 --> 01:50:37.320]   She is gorgeous.
[01:50:37.320 --> 01:50:38.520]   She is really beautiful.
[01:50:38.520 --> 01:50:39.520]   So, that's nice.
[01:50:39.520 --> 01:50:40.520]   Thank you.
[01:50:40.520 --> 01:50:41.520]   Better myself.
[01:50:41.520 --> 01:50:42.520]   Proud Daddy.
[01:50:42.520 --> 01:50:43.520]   Oh, yeah.
[01:50:43.520 --> 01:50:44.520]   Proud, proud Daddy.
[01:50:44.520 --> 01:50:45.520]   Super duper.
[01:50:45.520 --> 01:50:46.520]   Xbox One.
[01:50:46.520 --> 01:50:50.400]   They announced the S Slim.
[01:50:50.400 --> 01:50:53.160]   40% Slimmer.
[01:50:53.160 --> 01:50:58.600]   More importantly, it now has built into it a Blu-ray UHD player, which means you can buy
[01:50:58.600 --> 01:51:03.320]   it instead of a standalone Blu-ray UHD player if you have a 4K TV.
[01:51:03.320 --> 01:51:04.680]   Not 4K gaming though.
[01:51:04.680 --> 01:51:05.680]   That's for next year.
[01:51:05.680 --> 01:51:06.680]   Yeah.
[01:51:06.680 --> 01:51:07.680]   I'm going to buy one of those.
[01:51:07.680 --> 01:51:09.480]   And even that probably won't be true in a gaming.
[01:51:09.480 --> 01:51:10.480]   It won't.
[01:51:10.480 --> 01:51:11.480]   What are they going to do?
[01:51:11.480 --> 01:51:12.480]   Probably not.
[01:51:12.480 --> 01:51:14.840]   I mean, it's just judging from the hardware we have today, right?
[01:51:14.840 --> 01:51:18.920]   The GTX 1080, which is the most powerful video card on the market.
[01:51:18.920 --> 01:51:23.440]   And it gets 4K at 30 FPS.
[01:51:23.440 --> 01:51:25.280]   Some games may be closer to 50.
[01:51:25.280 --> 01:51:26.840]   It doesn't quite get to 60.
[01:51:26.840 --> 01:51:28.440]   That's a lot of pixels to push.
[01:51:28.440 --> 01:51:29.440]   That's a lot of pixels.
[01:51:29.440 --> 01:51:34.480]   And honestly, I've said this before, like you rendering it 4K is such a waste of computing
[01:51:34.480 --> 01:51:35.480]   power.
[01:51:35.480 --> 01:51:41.440]   I think if the next Xbox rendered it like 1440p or 2K or maybe some sort of lower resolution
[01:51:41.440 --> 01:51:45.760]   and just like up-up-risk, a little to 4K, nobody would tell the difference.
[01:51:45.760 --> 01:51:47.000]   And it would still look good.
[01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.680]   That would still give it room to do a lot of great visual effects work.
[01:51:49.680 --> 01:51:54.160]   I think I called the radio show today, said, "What's the best 4K 40-inch TV?"
[01:51:54.160 --> 01:51:56.160]   I said, "I don't get a 4-inch.
[01:51:56.160 --> 01:51:57.160]   I'll get a 4-inch."
[01:51:57.160 --> 01:51:58.560]   For all you combine now.
[01:51:58.560 --> 01:51:59.560]   Yeah.
[01:51:59.560 --> 01:52:00.560]   Yeah.
[01:52:00.560 --> 01:52:02.520]   I mean, if it's that small, you don't need 4K.
[01:52:02.520 --> 01:52:03.520]   You don't need it.
[01:52:03.520 --> 01:52:05.560]   And probably for gaming, you don't really need 4K yet.
[01:52:05.560 --> 01:52:07.120]   No, definitely not.
[01:52:07.120 --> 01:52:08.120]   No.
[01:52:08.120 --> 01:52:09.640]   But I'm going to get that Xbox finally.
[01:52:09.640 --> 01:52:13.240]   So now I can, we can play games together on Gileo because that I want that small-
[01:52:13.240 --> 01:52:14.800]   I'm an Xbox One fan.
[01:52:14.800 --> 01:52:15.800]   I'm an Xbox One fan.
[01:52:15.800 --> 01:52:16.800]   Get all that stuff.
[01:52:16.800 --> 01:52:17.800]   I just couldn't do it.
[01:52:17.800 --> 01:52:20.840]   I'm going to get a PlayStation 4 because I want to do the PS4 VR.
[01:52:20.840 --> 01:52:22.680]   But now I'm starting to think maybe I should-
[01:52:22.680 --> 01:52:24.040]   Wait, wait on the PlayStation 4.
[01:52:24.040 --> 01:52:25.040]   Really?
[01:52:25.040 --> 01:52:26.040]   Is that bad?
[01:52:26.040 --> 01:52:27.040]   Yeah.
[01:52:27.040 --> 01:52:29.840]   I played it, they brought it in for a demo on this triangulation a couple of weeks ago.
[01:52:29.840 --> 01:52:34.000]   And I played that game where you're driving down the highway and the Russian mob is trying
[01:52:34.000 --> 01:52:35.480]   to shoot you and you shoot them.
[01:52:35.480 --> 01:52:36.480]   And it was-
[01:52:36.480 --> 01:52:37.480]   Did you get-
[01:52:37.480 --> 01:52:38.480]   Fautious?
[01:52:38.480 --> 01:52:39.480]   No, not at all.
[01:52:39.480 --> 01:52:40.480]   Nice.
[01:52:40.480 --> 01:52:41.480]   Not at all.
[01:52:41.480 --> 01:52:42.480]   And I sometimes do.
[01:52:42.480 --> 01:52:45.360]   There I am really looking like Yule Gibbons with my suspenders.
[01:52:45.360 --> 01:52:46.360]   Suspenders.
[01:52:46.360 --> 01:52:51.520]   I would just wait a little to see what we hear about the slightly upgraded PlayStation 4.
[01:52:51.520 --> 01:52:53.880]   So I don't know if that's going to be next year or holiday season.
[01:52:53.880 --> 01:52:58.320]   And you think it needs that for the higher frame rate?
[01:52:58.320 --> 01:53:00.560]   It may and maybe some games may require it.
[01:53:00.560 --> 01:53:01.760]   I'm worried about what-
[01:53:01.760 --> 01:53:02.760]   Yeah.
[01:53:02.760 --> 01:53:07.000]   Gaming in VR will mean on the PS4 as it is right now.
[01:53:07.000 --> 01:53:11.040]   But just for your sake, in terms of getting the best value and for consumers, right?
[01:53:11.040 --> 01:53:12.840]   You may want to wait before buying a PS4.
[01:53:12.840 --> 01:53:16.120]   But I don't know if Leo actually cares about the value.
[01:53:16.120 --> 01:53:18.720]   He wants to just try it so that he knows that he has everything.
[01:53:18.720 --> 01:53:21.000]   Like he has his vault, that he has to fill up again.
[01:53:21.000 --> 01:53:22.000]   Yeah.
[01:53:22.000 --> 01:53:25.520]   I got a five and an Oculus Rift and a Gear VR.
[01:53:25.520 --> 01:53:27.200]   The vendor's talking about regular consumers.
[01:53:27.200 --> 01:53:28.200]   He's looking at-
[01:53:28.200 --> 01:53:29.200]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:53:29.200 --> 01:53:30.200]   And I think that's good advice.
[01:53:30.200 --> 01:53:31.200]   Yeah.
[01:53:31.200 --> 01:53:32.200]   Or everyone else, but for Leo, he's probably-
[01:53:32.200 --> 01:53:36.320]   I got to tell you, there's 40 million PlayStation 4 owners and the price is right.
[01:53:36.320 --> 01:53:37.320]   It's only a few hundred dollars.
[01:53:37.320 --> 01:53:39.800]   It's the lowest cost VR option out there.
[01:53:39.800 --> 01:53:41.160]   That's what they need the market to boom from.
[01:53:41.160 --> 01:53:42.160]   So they better fix it.
[01:53:42.160 --> 01:53:45.160]   If there's issues like that, they better fix it because that's where the market could
[01:53:45.160 --> 01:53:46.880]   explode and bring people in.
[01:53:46.880 --> 01:53:50.040]   Again, I'm not dedicating a room and I really don't want to have a PC.
[01:53:50.040 --> 01:53:52.960]   I just don't want to spend all that money on like five games.
[01:53:52.960 --> 01:53:56.320]   Maybe when there's 20 games or 30 games or something, I have more options.
[01:53:56.320 --> 01:54:00.560]   Maybe but right now, I'm not in the review lifestyle and I just want the PlayStation
[01:54:00.560 --> 01:54:02.920]   to work so that I can enjoy the lawnmower.
[01:54:02.920 --> 01:54:06.080]   Man, like the rest of you guys, but maybe not.
[01:54:06.080 --> 01:54:07.080]   It'll be-
[01:54:07.080 --> 01:54:10.440]   I mean, it probably won't be until next year that console VR will be really interesting.
[01:54:10.440 --> 01:54:14.000]   Like what Microsoft is talking about with Project Scorpio, like they- it's weird that
[01:54:14.000 --> 01:54:19.160]   they even confirmed that there's a new more, even more powerful Xbox coming next year.
[01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:23.600]   That seems like a self-defeating thing to do because a lot of people just wait.
[01:54:23.600 --> 01:54:25.000]   There were a ton of rumors.
[01:54:25.000 --> 01:54:26.760]   There were some leaks before it either.
[01:54:26.760 --> 01:54:30.520]   I think they kind of just have to like get out and say, "Okay, the Xbox One S, this is
[01:54:30.520 --> 01:54:31.520]   here now.
[01:54:31.520 --> 01:54:33.320]   Next year we'll have something better."
[01:54:33.320 --> 01:54:37.160]   I also don't know what that'll mean for sales for the Xbox One S or even the Xbox One
[01:54:37.160 --> 01:54:38.160]   for this year.
[01:54:38.160 --> 01:54:39.160]   Right.
[01:54:39.160 --> 01:54:40.960]   Little, it'll be interesting to see.
[01:54:40.960 --> 01:54:43.600]   Look, you're gonna need that horsepower for great VR.
[01:54:43.600 --> 01:54:44.800]   That's the thing.
[01:54:44.800 --> 01:54:46.840]   Let me lend this thought process to you.
[01:54:46.840 --> 01:54:50.600]   Maybe they're taking the Apple approach because I have a lot of friends that said, "Oh, I'm
[01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:53.680]   just gonna trade in my Xbox One and get the slimmer Xbox."
[01:54:53.680 --> 01:54:56.480]   So maybe that mine said, "Hey, you put it out a new thing.
[01:54:56.480 --> 01:55:00.800]   If they offer VR, you just say, "Okay, I'm gonna trade in my Xbox One S and get that."
[01:55:00.800 --> 01:55:02.720]   It came as not notorious for patience.
[01:55:02.720 --> 01:55:05.120]   This is not that hard to sell an existing system.
[01:55:05.120 --> 01:55:07.240]   I think that's not the best way to do it.
[01:55:07.240 --> 01:55:09.520]   But it'll still have some impact on sales.
[01:55:09.520 --> 01:55:10.520]   We'll just wait two.
[01:55:10.520 --> 01:55:11.520]   Yeah.
[01:55:11.520 --> 01:55:16.160]   Well, especially if you already have an Xbox One, there's not a huge compelling reason
[01:55:16.160 --> 01:55:17.320]   to go to the Xbox One S.
[01:55:17.320 --> 01:55:23.000]   I mean, the 4K Blu-ray is kind of nice, but whatever Sony ends up putting out, we'll
[01:55:23.000 --> 01:55:26.640]   like the PlayStation, you know, we'll probably have that as well because that's Sony's format.
[01:55:26.640 --> 01:55:28.960]   So yeah, I'd expect them to do that.
[01:55:28.960 --> 01:55:36.080]   But I do have to say at $2.99, which is how much the least expensive Xbox One S series,
[01:55:36.080 --> 01:55:38.200]   the 500 gigabyte version.
[01:55:38.200 --> 01:55:44.120]   That is the least expensive UHD Blu-ray player out there by far, like a couple hundred bucks.
[01:55:44.120 --> 01:55:46.520]   And that's another way to get into the market with other things.
[01:55:46.520 --> 01:55:47.680]   They know what they're doing.
[01:55:47.680 --> 01:55:48.680]   Yeah.
[01:55:48.680 --> 01:55:49.680]   That carrot.
[01:55:49.680 --> 01:55:50.680]   I didn't know.
[01:55:50.680 --> 01:55:53.680]   Well, and that's why I bought the Xbox 360 because I really wanted it a HD DVD player.
[01:55:53.680 --> 01:55:55.920]   I'm so glad I have that now.
[01:55:55.920 --> 01:55:56.920]   Yeah.
[01:55:56.920 --> 01:55:57.920]   That's rough.
[01:55:57.920 --> 01:55:59.160]   You bet on the wrong ones.
[01:55:59.160 --> 01:56:01.560]   That's why I've been on Playstace for so long because I blew right.
[01:56:01.560 --> 01:56:02.560]   I've been on the wrong ones.
[01:56:02.560 --> 01:56:05.720]   Working with itself like me, who knows what legs that Sandra will have.
[01:56:05.720 --> 01:56:10.520]   Wow, I don't think it's not like the HDR HD DVD versus Blu-ray.
[01:56:10.520 --> 01:56:11.520]   They're whether it's two standards.
[01:56:11.520 --> 01:56:14.360]   It's more like we don't need it.
[01:56:14.360 --> 01:56:17.600]   If you have a new set, if you have the super UHD set.
[01:56:17.600 --> 01:56:18.600]   If you have a new set.
[01:56:18.600 --> 01:56:19.600]   Yeah.
[01:56:19.600 --> 01:56:23.160]   But even then, like if you have a new set, you probably have apps built into your TV that
[01:56:23.160 --> 01:56:25.280]   can stream in 4K and the TV.
[01:56:25.280 --> 01:56:27.720]   But streaming is never going to be as good as physical media.
[01:56:27.720 --> 01:56:28.720]   No, probably not.
[01:56:28.720 --> 01:56:29.720]   Probably not.
[01:56:29.720 --> 01:56:30.720]   Like, definitely not.
[01:56:30.720 --> 01:56:33.960]   But at the same time, like that is more than good enough.
[01:56:33.960 --> 01:56:37.960]   Like that is going to still be a leap ahead of maybe 1080p for some people.
[01:56:37.960 --> 01:56:41.120]   Which honestly, you probably can't even tell the difference between 1080p and 4K.
[01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:45.920]   So like, it's just the idea of 4K media as like a physical thing.
[01:56:45.920 --> 01:56:47.680]   I don't know who that's for.
[01:56:47.680 --> 01:56:48.680]   You know, especially with 4K games.
[01:56:48.680 --> 01:56:50.680]   What do you mean, like, games such a hard upgrade?
[01:56:50.680 --> 01:56:51.680]   It's for guys.
[01:56:51.680 --> 01:56:52.680]   I can't tell the difference between 4K.
[01:56:52.680 --> 01:56:54.160]   I'd love to say that they have bigger and better.
[01:56:54.160 --> 01:56:55.640]   That's just the way that it kind of comes.
[01:56:55.640 --> 01:56:56.640]   Well, some of us do.
[01:56:56.640 --> 01:56:57.640]   That's the numbers game.
[01:56:57.640 --> 01:56:58.640]   Yeah.
[01:56:58.640 --> 01:56:59.640]   Yeah.
[01:56:59.640 --> 01:57:02.600]   And the bigger the numbers, people are like, well, this is better than what you have.
[01:57:02.600 --> 01:57:05.080]   And so I think that numbers matter.
[01:57:05.080 --> 01:57:10.200]   I think that, you know, again, we'll end up, you know, it'll end up coming out that people
[01:57:10.200 --> 01:57:11.960]   will really need it at some point in time.
[01:57:11.960 --> 01:57:14.600]   But you know, the funny thing is just go ahead.
[01:57:14.600 --> 01:57:18.240]   I can't let you get away with saying that you can't tell the difference between 1080p
[01:57:18.240 --> 01:57:19.240]   and 4K.
[01:57:19.240 --> 01:57:20.240]   Unless people can't.
[01:57:20.240 --> 01:57:21.240]   Unless people can't.
[01:57:21.240 --> 01:57:22.240]   Unless you're one or two.
[01:57:22.240 --> 01:57:23.240]   Are you sitting there?
[01:57:23.240 --> 01:57:26.880]   Unless I'm doing like, yeah, I don't think that I really, I don't think that I really
[01:57:26.880 --> 01:57:29.080]   notice and I don't think that I was like, terrified.
[01:57:29.080 --> 01:57:34.080]   I did notice.
[01:57:34.080 --> 01:57:37.080]   No, no, let's not do that.
[01:57:37.080 --> 01:57:39.080]   But even she just did it.
[01:57:39.080 --> 01:57:40.080]   I'm not being sexist.
[01:57:40.080 --> 01:57:41.080]   She just said that.
[01:57:41.080 --> 01:57:42.080]   You just bigger better.
[01:57:42.080 --> 01:57:44.360]   The thing is like, in terms of what you can actually see.
[01:57:44.360 --> 01:57:46.000]   I can tell the difference.
[01:57:46.000 --> 01:57:47.000]   I can tell it.
[01:57:47.000 --> 01:57:48.000]   I can tell it.
[01:57:48.000 --> 01:57:50.840]   You're really up close to a really big screen to see that difference.
[01:57:50.840 --> 01:57:52.600]   And that's not how you sit back and enjoy movies.
[01:57:52.600 --> 01:57:57.280]   So by the time you're on the couch and you're relaxing in your normal position, your eyes
[01:57:57.280 --> 01:57:58.400]   aren't seeing much more.
[01:57:58.400 --> 01:58:05.040]   The other issue is of course the titles available, which aren't really very, I mean, the Martian
[01:58:05.040 --> 01:58:06.320]   is available, which would be good.
[01:58:06.320 --> 01:58:07.320]   The amazing Spider-Man.
[01:58:07.320 --> 01:58:08.320]   The most amazing Spider-Man.
[01:58:08.320 --> 01:58:09.320]   Chappy.
[01:58:09.320 --> 01:58:10.320]   Yeah.
[01:58:10.320 --> 01:58:11.320]   Are Expendables 3.
[01:58:11.320 --> 01:58:12.320]   Hancock.
[01:58:12.320 --> 01:58:13.320]   Most of the size of it.
[01:58:13.320 --> 01:58:16.400]   Why are they bother making Hancock available?
[01:58:16.400 --> 01:58:17.400]   Pineapple Express.
[01:58:17.400 --> 01:58:18.400]   Well, thank God.
[01:58:18.400 --> 01:58:19.400]   I've been waiting for that.
[01:58:19.400 --> 01:58:20.400]   Hey, they have to move the driver.
[01:58:20.400 --> 01:58:21.400]   This is ultra-reel.
[01:58:21.400 --> 01:58:24.240]   It's got a Sony has to like, start spitting them out.
[01:58:24.240 --> 01:58:25.240]   The Revenant.
[01:58:25.240 --> 01:58:28.240]   You don't want to see that bear in ultra-high def.
[01:58:28.240 --> 01:58:30.000]   I want to feel the hairs on that bear's back.
[01:58:30.000 --> 01:58:31.000]   Oh, man.
[01:58:31.000 --> 01:58:33.120]   That was too real as it was.
[01:58:33.120 --> 01:58:34.640]   Dead pool I would buy.
[01:58:34.640 --> 01:58:35.640]   That came out already.
[01:58:35.640 --> 01:58:39.880]   Speaking of like between the difference between physical 4K Blu-ray and streaming, like even
[01:58:39.880 --> 01:58:42.160]   streaming right now, you have many more options.
[01:58:42.160 --> 01:58:43.160]   That's the other thing too.
[01:58:43.160 --> 01:58:50.720]   So it's kind of want to buy like another $300, $400 box for this platform, which you may
[01:58:50.720 --> 01:58:55.800]   see like negligible advantage over 4K streaming unless you don't have a fast enough internet
[01:58:55.800 --> 01:58:56.800]   connection to handle it.
[01:58:56.800 --> 01:58:59.160]   That's the only real reason I think.
[01:58:59.160 --> 01:59:00.160]   Yeah.
[01:59:00.160 --> 01:59:01.160]   I agree with you.
[01:59:01.160 --> 01:59:02.160]   I'm just saying I can tell a difference.
[01:59:02.160 --> 01:59:03.160]   That's all I'm saying.
[01:59:03.160 --> 01:59:07.480]   I mean, we don't like to think we can tell the difference, but yeah.
[01:59:07.480 --> 01:59:11.000]   Just because you can't and maybe it's because we still wear glasses and I've got LASIK,
[01:59:11.000 --> 01:59:12.000]   but this ultra-vision like.
[01:59:12.000 --> 01:59:13.000]   See the likes.
[01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:14.000]   Yeah.
[01:59:14.000 --> 01:59:15.000]   Yeah.
[01:59:15.000 --> 01:59:16.000]   Basic.
[01:59:16.000 --> 01:59:17.000]   LASIK fades away.
[01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:18.000]   That was a place like LASIK fades away.
[01:59:18.000 --> 01:59:19.000]   Yeah.
[01:59:19.000 --> 01:59:20.000]   Over time.
[01:59:20.000 --> 01:59:21.000]   Oh, I go back.
[01:59:21.000 --> 01:59:22.000]   I mean, you were right.
[01:59:22.000 --> 01:59:23.000]   They're measuring, aren't they?
[01:59:23.000 --> 01:59:24.000]   What are you talking about?
[01:59:24.000 --> 01:59:25.000]   Nothing.
[01:59:25.000 --> 01:59:26.000]   Nothing.
[01:59:26.000 --> 01:59:27.000]   Nothing.
[01:59:27.000 --> 01:59:28.000]   4K.
[01:59:28.000 --> 01:59:29.000]   Just George and I talking.
[01:59:29.000 --> 01:59:30.000]   4K all day.
[01:59:30.000 --> 01:59:31.000]   It's a nice number.
[01:59:31.000 --> 01:59:32.000]   It's a nice number.
[01:59:32.000 --> 01:59:33.000]   It's a nice number.
[01:59:33.000 --> 01:59:34.000]   It's a nice number.
[01:59:34.000 --> 01:59:35.000]   It's a nice number.
[01:59:35.000 --> 01:59:36.000]   I don't even know on a 4K TV because I haven't bought until the hype yet.
[01:59:36.000 --> 01:59:37.000]   So just know that I'm just busting.
[01:59:37.000 --> 01:59:38.000]   There you go.
[01:59:38.000 --> 01:59:39.000]   There you go.
[01:59:39.000 --> 01:59:40.800]   I can't wait to get a 3D TV.
[01:59:40.800 --> 01:59:42.400]   I hear that's the next big thing.
[01:59:42.400 --> 01:59:43.400]   I'm 30.
[01:59:43.400 --> 01:59:44.400]   All my TVs are 3D.
[01:59:44.400 --> 01:59:47.120]   I mean, one time the first week I bought these TVs.
[01:59:47.120 --> 01:59:48.120]   Yeah.
[01:59:48.120 --> 01:59:49.120]   I have glasses.
[01:59:49.120 --> 01:59:52.520]   They have this inch, thick inch of dust on the 3D glasses because I've never used glasses.
[01:59:52.520 --> 01:59:54.960]   Are your glasses powered or not powered?
[01:59:54.960 --> 01:59:55.960]   They're all powered.
[01:59:55.960 --> 01:59:56.960]   They're battery powered.
[01:59:56.960 --> 01:59:58.280]   I have an LG TV.
[01:59:58.280 --> 02:00:02.120]   The non-powered ones are better than the ones that are on my Samsung power.
[02:00:02.120 --> 02:00:03.120]   And as just like, "Ahh."
[02:00:03.120 --> 02:00:04.120]   As gave up.
[02:00:04.120 --> 02:00:08.280]   And we actually, we're going to, I just want to, I should announce now in the new studio,
[02:00:08.280 --> 02:00:12.800]   we thought about immersive video but we've decided to make everything 3D from now on.
[02:00:12.800 --> 02:00:16.000]   So all of our video will be 3D.
[02:00:16.000 --> 02:00:17.000]   Look at that.
[02:00:17.000 --> 02:00:18.000]   Are you being serious?
[02:00:18.000 --> 02:00:19.000]   I hope you're serious.
[02:00:19.000 --> 02:00:20.000]   I was going to ask.
[02:00:20.000 --> 02:00:21.000]   I was like, "That really, you guys just like…"
[02:00:21.000 --> 02:00:26.000]   I can't tell.
[02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:29.000]   I don't want to be.
[02:00:29.000 --> 02:00:30.000]   I don't want to be.
[02:00:30.000 --> 02:00:31.880]   How do you like me now?
[02:00:31.880 --> 02:00:35.960]   I just wanted to make sure.
[02:00:35.960 --> 02:00:37.520]   So immersive.
[02:00:37.520 --> 02:00:40.600]   I can't wait.
[02:00:40.600 --> 02:00:42.800]   No, we're not going to do that actually.
[02:00:42.800 --> 02:00:44.800]   I would like to see a VR camera though.
[02:00:44.800 --> 02:00:45.800]   Yeah, at some point.
[02:00:45.800 --> 02:00:47.360]   We will, no, we'll do VR.
[02:00:47.360 --> 02:00:50.880]   In fact, I think in the design of the studio, we're kind of cognizant of the…
[02:00:50.880 --> 02:00:55.200]   …idea that at some point in the next year or so, everything will be 3…
[02:00:55.200 --> 02:00:58.880]   Or some of the stuff we do will 360, so we have to look good all the way around.
[02:00:58.880 --> 02:00:59.880]   Ooh.
[02:00:59.880 --> 02:01:00.880]   Ooh, day.
[02:01:00.880 --> 02:01:01.880]   I think he's joining us now.
[02:01:01.880 --> 02:01:03.880]   I'm going to put him on 3D glasses so I can see it.
[02:01:03.880 --> 02:01:04.880]   Who's the man?
[02:01:04.880 --> 02:01:05.880]   I'm going to go and cut back.
[02:01:05.880 --> 02:01:06.880]   Wait, wait, here.
[02:01:06.880 --> 02:01:08.480]   You can see Leo now in 3D.
[02:01:08.480 --> 02:01:09.480]   I got him.
[02:01:09.480 --> 02:01:10.480]   Wait.
[02:01:10.480 --> 02:01:11.480]   Wait a minute.
[02:01:11.480 --> 02:01:12.480]   Wait a minute.
[02:01:12.480 --> 02:01:14.280]   Why do you have a cutout of me?
[02:01:14.280 --> 02:01:15.280]   That's actually…
[02:01:15.280 --> 02:01:16.280]   That's what I'm wowing for.
[02:01:16.280 --> 02:01:17.280]   At least it's hard.
[02:01:17.280 --> 02:01:18.280]   Where'd that come from?
[02:01:18.280 --> 02:01:19.280]   It's going to be…
[02:01:19.280 --> 02:01:20.280]   It's going to be…
[02:01:20.280 --> 02:01:21.280]   It's going to be weird.
[02:01:21.280 --> 02:01:22.280]   What the what?
[02:01:22.280 --> 02:01:24.280]   Do you do little shows?
[02:01:24.280 --> 02:01:25.280]   How do you do it?
[02:01:25.280 --> 02:01:26.280]   Little puppet shows?
[02:01:26.280 --> 02:01:27.280]   I got Megan and Leo.
[02:01:27.280 --> 02:01:28.280]   I got…
[02:01:28.280 --> 02:01:29.280]   So Megan did a…
[02:01:29.280 --> 02:01:30.280]   We did a…
[02:01:30.280 --> 02:01:31.280]   It's just…
[02:01:31.280 --> 02:01:32.280]   …on a tech news.
[02:01:32.280 --> 02:01:33.280]   We did a…
[02:01:33.280 --> 02:01:36.280]   Like make your own iPhone screen thing, go to the dollar store.
[02:01:36.280 --> 02:01:38.680]   We made our own iPhones cases.
[02:01:38.680 --> 02:01:40.120]   And so I made a whole bunch of cases.
[02:01:40.120 --> 02:01:42.000]   I have my like fuzzy case.
[02:01:42.000 --> 02:01:45.560]   I had my little sprinkly like case with all the little stones all over it.
[02:01:45.560 --> 02:01:49.840]   And then I ended up making my Leo and Megan case.
[02:01:49.840 --> 02:01:52.840]   So this was stuck on the back of my case for a while.
[02:01:52.840 --> 02:01:53.840]   There we go.
[02:01:53.840 --> 02:01:58.800]   Did people ask you why do you have that strange couple on the back of your phone?
[02:01:58.800 --> 02:02:02.240]   I didn't actually take it out into the wild so I can't tell you.
[02:02:02.240 --> 02:02:07.640]   Somebody made me this back when 3D was going to be the next big thing and it made me a
[02:02:07.640 --> 02:02:09.440]   3D of me.
[02:02:09.440 --> 02:02:10.440]   Wow.
[02:02:10.440 --> 02:02:12.440]   That is really weird.
[02:02:12.440 --> 02:02:13.440]   Huh?
[02:02:13.440 --> 02:02:14.440]   First of all, that's really scary.
[02:02:14.440 --> 02:02:15.440]   What's happening there?
[02:02:15.440 --> 02:02:16.440]   What's happening there?
[02:02:16.440 --> 02:02:17.440]   What's happening there?
[02:02:17.440 --> 02:02:20.440]   What's happening here?
[02:02:20.440 --> 02:02:21.440]   What's happening?
[02:02:21.440 --> 02:02:22.440]   What happens?
[02:02:22.440 --> 02:02:23.440]   I think it's very realistic.
[02:02:23.440 --> 02:02:24.440]   I don't know why I'm eating the microphone.
[02:02:24.440 --> 02:02:25.440]   I think that is…
[02:02:25.440 --> 02:02:26.440]   There was an error.
[02:02:26.440 --> 02:02:28.440]   The printer, the 3D printer had a problem.
[02:02:28.440 --> 02:02:29.440]   It looks like Dexter.
[02:02:29.440 --> 02:02:31.440]   That's how Dexter would kill you.
[02:02:31.440 --> 02:02:32.440]   Yeah.
[02:02:32.440 --> 02:02:33.440]   Were they angry at you?
[02:02:33.440 --> 02:02:37.440]   I don't know why they chose this image of all the images they could make.
[02:02:37.440 --> 02:02:39.440]   Is it a microphone and shove it?
[02:02:39.440 --> 02:02:40.440]   Yeah.
[02:02:40.440 --> 02:02:41.440]   It's very realistic.
[02:02:41.440 --> 02:02:42.440]   That's my profile.
[02:02:42.440 --> 02:02:43.440]   Except for the microphone.
[02:02:43.440 --> 02:02:44.440]   Except the microphone.
[02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:45.440]   The part.
[02:02:45.440 --> 02:02:46.440]   Yeah.
[02:02:46.440 --> 02:02:47.440]   It's a very realistic picture.
[02:02:47.440 --> 02:02:48.440]   It's a very realistic picture.
[02:02:48.440 --> 02:02:49.440]   It's a very interesting picture.
[02:02:49.440 --> 02:02:50.440]   It's a very interesting picture.
[02:02:50.440 --> 02:02:51.440]   It's a very interesting picture.

[02:05:24.440 --> 02:05:25.440]   It's a very interesting picture.
[02:05:25.440 --> 02:05:27.440]   Expect that to be a launch game for whatever VR.
[02:05:27.440 --> 02:05:29.440]   We actually have Microsoft ties to the Scorpio thing next year.
[02:05:29.440 --> 02:05:30.440]   You bet.
[02:05:30.440 --> 02:05:31.440]   It's going to be a big deal.
[02:05:31.440 --> 02:05:32.440]   Yeah.
[02:05:32.440 --> 02:05:35.440]   Twitter invests in SoundCloud.
[02:05:35.440 --> 02:05:40.440]   SoundCloud really, I thought, was almost on its last legs, which is a shame because it's a great service.
[02:05:40.440 --> 02:05:41.440]   I really love it.
[02:05:41.440 --> 02:05:46.440]   The Berlin company has been losing money like crazy.
[02:05:46.440 --> 02:05:54.440]   Looking for people to keep it afloat, Twitter invested $70 million as part of a round that should end up in the $100 million.
[02:05:54.440 --> 02:05:59.440]   A range valuing SoundCloud at $700 million.
[02:05:59.440 --> 02:06:02.440]   I hope we save SoundCloud because I think it's really important.
[02:06:02.440 --> 02:06:05.440]   I think actually it's a nice match with Twitter, to be honest.
[02:06:05.440 --> 02:06:06.440]   I love SoundCloud.
[02:06:06.440 --> 02:06:14.440]   I think a lot of artists have discovered that they can reach an audience on SoundCloud very effectively.
[02:06:14.440 --> 02:06:16.440]   In fact, I look at my 21-year-old.
[02:06:16.440 --> 02:06:18.440]   He spends a lot of time listening to SoundCloud, of all things.
[02:06:18.440 --> 02:06:22.440]   I suppose I could see some better SoundCloud integration in Twitter eventually.
[02:06:22.440 --> 02:06:25.440]   They've been pushing more and more media into tweets.
[02:06:25.440 --> 02:06:26.440]   That could be cool.
[02:06:26.440 --> 02:06:27.440]   Yeah.
[02:06:27.440 --> 02:06:29.440]   That's Twitter figures itself out still.
[02:06:29.440 --> 02:06:30.440]   As well.
[02:06:30.440 --> 02:06:32.440]   Twitter's got its own work to do also.
[02:06:32.440 --> 02:06:34.440]   Here's the exciting secret sauce.
[02:06:34.440 --> 02:06:39.440]   Twitter's now going to let advertisers target users based on emojis.
[02:06:39.440 --> 02:06:41.440]   I got it.
[02:06:41.440 --> 02:06:42.440]   It starts.
[02:06:42.440 --> 02:06:43.440]   It has begun.
[02:06:43.440 --> 02:06:45.440]   You're not real happy, Owen.
[02:06:45.440 --> 02:06:46.440]   But I'm sorry.
[02:06:46.440 --> 02:06:47.440]   I know.
[02:06:47.440 --> 02:06:48.440]   He doesn't use them.
[02:06:48.440 --> 02:06:50.440]   He won't be targeted for anything.
[02:06:50.440 --> 02:06:53.440]   I'm your target because you're going to tweet at me.
[02:06:53.440 --> 02:06:54.440]   You better hush them out.
[02:06:54.440 --> 02:06:55.440]   No, I'm not.
[02:06:55.440 --> 02:06:57.440]   They're using as an example.
[02:06:57.440 --> 02:07:08.440]   If you tweet a pizza emoji, a now pizza restaurant can send you a little gift coupon for a delicious slice of deep dish.
[02:07:08.440 --> 02:07:11.440]   Why look at that on the screen when you could actually be eating it?
[02:07:11.440 --> 02:07:17.440]   Twitter says 110 billion emojis have been tweeted in the last two years.
[02:07:17.440 --> 02:07:30.440]   They don't understand the way that emojis are used because the idea of emoji, I don't use emojis because if I send a goat with a little gas symbol afterwards, that's not because I like gas just goats.
[02:07:30.440 --> 02:07:32.440]   There's an emoji for that?
[02:07:32.440 --> 02:07:34.440]   You put them together.
[02:07:34.440 --> 02:07:36.440]   You put them together.
[02:07:36.440 --> 02:07:38.440]   You put them together with a goat.
[02:07:38.440 --> 02:07:40.440]   But actually any emoji could have a little...
[02:07:40.440 --> 02:07:41.440]   Yeah, okay.
[02:07:41.440 --> 02:07:42.440]   You could.
[02:07:42.440 --> 02:07:43.440]   Yes.
[02:07:43.440 --> 02:07:46.440]   That's not because I love goats or emojis.
[02:07:46.440 --> 02:07:49.440]   Owen's black heart is not because I want then suddenly to be invested in a black heart.
[02:07:49.440 --> 02:07:50.440]   Well, that's exactly right.
[02:07:50.440 --> 02:07:54.440]   So I think that it's not the right way to target advertising.
[02:07:54.440 --> 02:07:56.440]   Context is everything.
[02:07:56.440 --> 02:07:59.440]   They've got to do a motion analysis on what you're doing with that emoji.
[02:07:59.440 --> 02:08:00.440]   You may hate pizza.
[02:08:00.440 --> 02:08:01.440]   You might...
[02:08:01.440 --> 02:08:02.440]   I might be saying...
[02:08:02.440 --> 02:08:03.440]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:08:03.440 --> 02:08:04.440]   Yeah.
[02:08:04.440 --> 02:08:09.440]   Well, one more way targets can advertising can misrepresent you and send the wrong message.
[02:08:09.440 --> 02:08:10.440]   They're desperate for everything.
[02:08:10.440 --> 02:08:11.440]   It's just anything.
[02:08:11.440 --> 02:08:12.440]   Anything we can do.
[02:08:12.440 --> 02:08:13.440]   Anything we can do.
[02:08:13.440 --> 02:08:14.440]   Thermophone.
[02:08:14.440 --> 02:08:15.440]   Thermophone.
[02:08:15.440 --> 02:08:16.440]   Fair enough.
[02:08:16.440 --> 02:08:17.440]   What is that?
[02:08:17.440 --> 02:08:19.440]   I'm sure they have gifs and downloads that's going on too.
[02:08:19.440 --> 02:08:20.440]   Yeah.
[02:08:20.440 --> 02:08:22.440]   Is it dominoes or something you could tweet at them and they deliver you pizza?
[02:08:22.440 --> 02:08:23.440]   You could order it from a...
[02:08:23.440 --> 02:08:26.440]   I met yesterday the guy who writes the Dominoes app.
[02:08:26.440 --> 02:08:28.440]   Was in here in the studio.
[02:08:28.440 --> 02:08:29.440]   Nice.
[02:08:29.440 --> 02:08:30.440]   Yeah, I thought that.
[02:08:30.440 --> 02:08:31.440]   I think that's pretty cool.
[02:08:31.440 --> 02:08:34.440]   I'm not a fan of Dominoes pizza, but I didn't tell him that.
[02:08:34.440 --> 02:08:35.440]   But they...
[02:08:35.440 --> 02:08:36.440]   But very digital first.
[02:08:36.440 --> 02:08:39.440]   You could order a Dominoes on your Amazon Echo, right?
[02:08:39.440 --> 02:08:40.440]   Yep.
[02:08:40.440 --> 02:08:41.440]   They got their little robot delivering pizzas.
[02:08:41.440 --> 02:08:43.440]   They got the pizza delivery card.
[02:08:43.440 --> 02:08:48.440]   I guess if your pizza tastes like crap, you got to have something to get people interested
[02:08:48.440 --> 02:08:49.440]   in.
[02:08:49.440 --> 02:08:51.440]   They're not advertising.
[02:08:51.440 --> 02:08:53.440]   Not now they are.
[02:08:53.440 --> 02:08:54.440]   Never again.
[02:08:54.440 --> 02:08:56.440]   Your only choice in much of America.
[02:08:56.440 --> 02:08:57.440]   What are you eating there?
[02:08:57.440 --> 02:08:59.440]   What kind of pizza is that there?
[02:08:59.440 --> 02:09:00.440]   What do you have?
[02:09:00.440 --> 02:09:01.440]   I'm all about local.
[02:09:01.440 --> 02:09:03.440]   This is some homegrown pizza.
[02:09:03.440 --> 02:09:04.440]   There you go.
[02:09:04.440 --> 02:09:05.440]   Local's always the best.
[02:09:05.440 --> 02:09:08.440]   You don't want chain pizzas off the chain.
[02:09:08.440 --> 02:09:09.440]   That's good.
[02:09:09.440 --> 02:09:10.440]   That looks good.
[02:09:10.440 --> 02:09:11.440]   That does look good.
[02:09:11.440 --> 02:09:12.440]   You're making me hungry.
[02:09:12.440 --> 02:09:13.440]   I'm getting hungry yesterday.
[02:09:13.440 --> 02:09:16.440]   And they over ordered pizzas and they sent everybody home like two pizzas.
[02:09:16.440 --> 02:09:17.440]   That's my dream.
[02:09:17.440 --> 02:09:19.440]   I have fantasies like that.
[02:09:19.440 --> 02:09:21.440]   Well, they ordered ordered pizzas.
[02:09:21.440 --> 02:09:22.440]   Please have one.
[02:09:22.440 --> 02:09:23.440]   Yeah.
[02:09:23.440 --> 02:09:25.440]   Literally there were seven pizzas of people's faces.
[02:09:25.440 --> 02:09:26.440]   Better than six.
[02:09:26.440 --> 02:09:27.440]   I'm taking one.
[02:09:27.440 --> 02:09:28.440]   You don't have to worry about it.
[02:09:28.440 --> 02:09:32.440]   See, I like the oven pizza where it's like, you know, actually cooked.
[02:09:32.440 --> 02:09:34.440]   Oh, Papa Murphy's taking bake kind of thing.
[02:09:34.440 --> 02:09:35.440]   Yeah, no.
[02:09:35.440 --> 02:09:36.440]   No, I like it.
[02:09:36.440 --> 02:09:38.440]   It's just, you know, real wood fire.
[02:09:38.440 --> 02:09:39.440]   You make your own.
[02:09:39.440 --> 02:09:40.440]   I don't.
[02:09:40.440 --> 02:09:45.800]   I like to go to places though that they have like a real pizza oven for like, you know,
[02:09:45.800 --> 02:09:47.440]   with the wood inside of it.
[02:09:47.440 --> 02:09:48.440]   Excuse me.
[02:09:48.440 --> 02:09:52.440]   I've just been informed off the chain is good, not bad.
[02:09:52.440 --> 02:09:53.440]   Yeah.
[02:09:53.440 --> 02:09:55.440]   Whatever I was saying, I take it back.
[02:09:55.440 --> 02:09:56.440]   It's the opposite.
[02:09:56.440 --> 02:09:57.440]   I'm on the chain.
[02:09:57.440 --> 02:09:58.440]   Is that what you're saying?
[02:09:58.440 --> 02:09:59.440]   I'm on the chain.
[02:09:59.440 --> 02:10:00.440]   Is that what the kids say?
[02:10:00.440 --> 02:10:01.440]   Lord help me.
[02:10:01.440 --> 02:10:02.440]   I'm on the chain.
[02:10:02.440 --> 02:10:03.440]   I'm on the chain.
[02:10:03.440 --> 02:10:05.440]   Our show today brought to you.
[02:10:05.440 --> 02:10:12.680]   My brain tree mobile app development tough.
[02:10:12.680 --> 02:10:14.960]   You got, you know, you're doing dominoes.
[02:10:14.960 --> 02:10:18.360]   You got enough problems getting that pizza and all the pictures and stuff.
[02:10:18.360 --> 02:10:22.560]   You don't want to do and you shouldn't be doing the e-commerce build into it.
[02:10:22.560 --> 02:10:23.560]   No, no, no.
[02:10:23.560 --> 02:10:24.800]   That's why you can use brain tree.
[02:10:24.800 --> 02:10:25.800]   It's beautiful.
[02:10:25.800 --> 02:10:27.720]   It's a beautiful thing with brain tree.
[02:10:27.720 --> 02:10:31.520]   You can accept every kind of payment on any kind of device.
[02:10:31.520 --> 02:10:35.560]   One easy integration, you get Apple Pay, Android Pay, PayPal, Bitcoin.
[02:10:35.560 --> 02:10:38.120]   Yeah, you can Bitcoin if you want.
[02:10:38.120 --> 02:10:42.160]   You get the control panel as you check the boxes you want.
[02:10:42.160 --> 02:10:43.840]   The thing is your customers trust it.
[02:10:43.840 --> 02:10:45.120]   They've seen it before.
[02:10:45.120 --> 02:10:49.120]   It's not like you're not leaving the app to do the e-commerce.
[02:10:49.120 --> 02:10:55.200]   70% of mobile shopping carts are abandoned before they click pay.
[02:10:55.200 --> 02:10:56.360]   That's not what you want.
[02:10:56.360 --> 02:10:58.160]   Brain tree eliminates.
[02:10:58.160 --> 02:11:00.480]   It eliminates that problem.
[02:11:00.480 --> 02:11:01.960]   So it's easy for you to use.
[02:11:01.960 --> 02:11:03.560]   It's a full stack payment solution.
[02:11:03.560 --> 02:11:06.560]   It's secure, great fraud protection.
[02:11:06.560 --> 02:11:07.560]   Your customers love it.
[02:11:07.560 --> 02:11:08.800]   They know it because they've used it.
[02:11:08.800 --> 02:11:11.200]   They've used it if you ever see the buyable pins from Pinterest.
[02:11:11.200 --> 02:11:12.600]   That's brain tree.
[02:11:12.600 --> 02:11:16.400]   If you have ever taken an Uber or a Lyft, they use brain tree.
[02:11:16.400 --> 02:11:17.400]   Both of them.
[02:11:17.400 --> 02:11:22.760]   Hotels tonight, Airbnb, brain tree, GitHub uses brain tree, simple secure payments, code
[02:11:22.760 --> 02:11:30.040]   you can integrate in quickly, Android, iOS, JavaScript, .NET, Node.js, Java, Pearl, PHP,
[02:11:30.040 --> 02:11:31.440]   Python, Ruby.
[02:11:31.440 --> 02:11:32.520]   It's elegant code.
[02:11:32.520 --> 02:11:35.120]   You can integrate it with just a few lines.
[02:11:35.120 --> 02:11:38.200]   There's no reason for you to write this from scratch.
[02:11:38.200 --> 02:11:39.360]   Go talk to the boss.
[02:11:39.360 --> 02:11:42.520]   If you're the boss, you got it.
[02:11:42.520 --> 02:11:44.840]   Braintreepayments.com/twit.
[02:11:44.840 --> 02:11:49.480]   And the boss will like this part, your first $50,000 in payments fee-free.
[02:11:49.480 --> 02:11:50.480]   Brain tree.
[02:11:50.480 --> 02:11:51.480]   All right.
[02:11:51.480 --> 02:11:55.920]   A couple of leftover crusts.
[02:11:55.920 --> 02:12:00.800]   Just want to mention, spam King Sanford Wallace.
[02:12:00.800 --> 02:12:07.200]   This guy has been spamming us for decades now.
[02:12:07.200 --> 02:12:13.000]   As an example, in four days, over three user sessions from November 2008 to February 2009,
[02:12:13.000 --> 02:12:19.600]   he sent 27 million spam messages to more than half a million Facebook users.
[02:12:19.600 --> 02:12:22.920]   He's been doing it since 1995.
[02:12:22.920 --> 02:12:26.320]   He's been sued many times, lost many judgments.
[02:12:26.320 --> 02:12:33.320]   In fact, total damages assessed against King approach a billion dollars, but now he's doing
[02:12:33.320 --> 02:12:34.320]   time.
[02:12:34.320 --> 02:12:42.120]   He's going to do two and a half years of time.
[02:12:42.120 --> 02:12:44.000]   I think we all agree.
[02:12:44.000 --> 02:12:45.720]   This is a good thing.
[02:12:45.720 --> 02:12:46.720]   This is a good thing.
[02:12:46.720 --> 02:12:50.600]   And by the way, not only is he going to have to undergo mental health treatment five years
[02:12:50.600 --> 02:12:55.520]   of probation once he's released, but he cannot own or use a computer without the permission
[02:12:55.520 --> 02:12:59.960]   of the court ever again.
[02:12:59.960 --> 02:13:01.560]   I wonder where this court was.
[02:13:01.560 --> 02:13:02.560]   Where is this court?
[02:13:02.560 --> 02:13:03.560]   San Jose.
[02:13:03.560 --> 02:13:04.560]   The US district court.
[02:13:04.560 --> 02:13:08.600]   Apparently out in California, they're letting dudes get away with a lot of things with six
[02:13:08.600 --> 02:13:10.960]   months in prison with three more probation.
[02:13:10.960 --> 02:13:11.960]   Yes.
[02:13:11.960 --> 02:13:15.200]   And this guy got two and a half years and five years probation.
[02:13:15.200 --> 02:13:16.800]   That's literally disgusting.
[02:13:16.800 --> 02:13:18.800]   Spam is worse than assault.
[02:13:18.800 --> 02:13:23.400]   The problem for me isn't the two and a half years for the spam guy.
[02:13:23.400 --> 02:13:25.200]   It's six months for the other guy.
[02:13:25.200 --> 02:13:28.600]   And I try to say to people when I complain about that, people like, no, I want more time
[02:13:28.600 --> 02:13:29.600]   for him.
[02:13:29.600 --> 02:13:30.600]   I don't want other criminals.
[02:13:30.600 --> 02:13:32.680]   Not last time for Spamford Wallace.
[02:13:32.680 --> 02:13:33.680]   Yeah.
[02:13:33.680 --> 02:13:34.680]   Yeah.
[02:13:34.680 --> 02:13:35.680]   Five years.
[02:13:35.680 --> 02:13:38.760]   The psycho vows, the big thing I guess if they think he's crazy or what not.
[02:13:38.760 --> 02:13:40.800]   Well, golly, he's been doing it since 1995.
[02:13:40.800 --> 02:13:43.880]   I mean, what kind of Georgia, you're a psychotherapist.
[02:13:43.880 --> 02:13:49.400]   What does the DSM-3 say for somebody who's been spamming for 20 years?
[02:13:49.400 --> 02:13:52.960]   It would really all depend on why he spams.
[02:13:52.960 --> 02:13:56.000]   Is it just to see people who have these angry, it's a detention?
[02:13:56.000 --> 02:13:57.000]   Yeah.
[02:13:57.000 --> 02:13:58.000]   All right.
[02:13:58.000 --> 02:14:00.440]   So you'd have to go through it and have to take a look at what type of spam he sends
[02:14:00.440 --> 02:14:01.440]   to people.
[02:14:01.440 --> 02:14:04.000]   Or maybe he just likes to make money.
[02:14:04.000 --> 02:14:05.080]   I don't know.
[02:14:05.080 --> 02:14:06.920]   How is he making money out of this spam?
[02:14:06.920 --> 02:14:09.880]   Is it for like, you know, vacation, please?
[02:14:09.880 --> 02:14:13.880]   Yeah.
[02:14:13.880 --> 02:14:15.480]   Lonely Girl 15.
[02:14:15.480 --> 02:14:16.920]   What the hell is her damage?
[02:14:16.920 --> 02:14:19.280]   She's back.
[02:14:19.280 --> 02:14:20.520]   This was the web series.
[02:14:20.520 --> 02:14:26.080]   Remember 10 years ago that everybody at first, you know, kind of fell for this?
[02:14:26.080 --> 02:14:28.080]   They thought it was real.
[02:14:28.080 --> 02:14:30.480]   They thought this was in 2006.
[02:14:30.480 --> 02:14:34.080]   She was a YouTube user, Lonely Girl 15.
[02:14:34.080 --> 02:14:39.880]   It was about a 16 year old girl named Bree who was in her bedroom making faces.
[02:14:39.880 --> 02:14:42.640]   And then the story got darker.
[02:14:42.640 --> 02:14:44.320]   She seemed like she might be in a cult.
[02:14:44.320 --> 02:14:46.920]   She was going to be doing a ceremony.
[02:14:46.920 --> 02:14:47.920]   Her parents went missing.
[02:14:47.920 --> 02:14:50.040]   Her machine, her boyfriend went on the run.
[02:14:50.040 --> 02:14:53.120]   And pretty soon people started to figure out, wait a minute.
[02:14:53.120 --> 02:14:54.720]   This is an actress.
[02:14:54.720 --> 02:14:55.720]   This is fake.
[02:14:55.720 --> 02:15:00.960]   Well, I guess everybody knows it's fake, but it's coming back.
[02:15:00.960 --> 02:15:03.680]   Well, how would you announce it?
[02:15:03.680 --> 02:15:05.240]   Why not just do some new fake thing?
[02:15:05.240 --> 02:15:06.240]   Yeah, I know.
[02:15:06.240 --> 02:15:07.240]   Trick everybody and make it awesome.
[02:15:07.240 --> 02:15:11.160]   Because she wants the attention from people now that she's announced it to go find out
[02:15:11.160 --> 02:15:12.160]   what is she about.
[02:15:12.160 --> 02:15:15.760]   So it's, again, another attention grab all over again because people will.
[02:15:15.760 --> 02:15:20.520]   They'll be linking down to her Facebook page and taking a look at what she has.
[02:15:20.520 --> 02:15:23.160]   One thing Lonely Girl 15 uses Linux.
[02:15:23.160 --> 02:15:24.160]   Okay.
[02:15:24.160 --> 02:15:26.400]   I'm just saying just point that out.
[02:15:26.400 --> 02:15:28.400]   It's a point too, but I'll forgive her that.
[02:15:28.400 --> 02:15:30.160]   And we brought it back full circle.
[02:15:30.160 --> 02:15:35.160]   So, pseudo-ovoltenecarepackage.mov.
[02:15:35.160 --> 02:15:37.080]   She's in doubt.
[02:15:37.080 --> 02:15:38.580]   She's pseudo-SU.
[02:15:38.580 --> 02:15:40.480]   She's, I don't know what's going on.
[02:15:40.480 --> 02:15:41.480]   This is some straight.
[02:15:41.480 --> 02:15:43.480]   Am I watching the right video?
[02:15:43.480 --> 02:15:45.080]   Linux girl 15.
[02:15:45.080 --> 02:15:46.440]   What the heck is going on here?
[02:15:46.440 --> 02:15:48.440]   Is this it?
[02:15:48.440 --> 02:15:50.440]   Oh, that's her.
[02:15:50.440 --> 02:15:51.440]   There she is.
[02:15:51.440 --> 02:15:53.440]   Being selected can be a very frightening thing.
[02:15:53.440 --> 02:15:55.440]   And it's okay to be afraid.
[02:15:55.440 --> 02:15:58.160]   When I was selected, I was terrified.
[02:15:58.160 --> 02:16:00.160]   I was back to that call thing.
[02:16:00.160 --> 02:16:04.080]   And my friends thought something would have happened to me.
[02:16:04.080 --> 02:16:05.080]   Nothing happened to me.
[02:16:05.080 --> 02:16:07.600]   It's not quite the same now that she's in her 30s.
[02:16:07.600 --> 02:16:11.880]   It's not the same after you know that the first part was all.
[02:16:11.880 --> 02:16:13.600]   That was my point.
[02:16:13.600 --> 02:16:15.600]   Yeah.
[02:16:15.600 --> 02:16:23.480]   Should we, I mean, on the one hand, it was a really interesting experiment in narrative
[02:16:23.480 --> 02:16:24.480]   and fiction.
[02:16:24.480 --> 02:16:29.000]   I think it's kind of inappropriate to pretend it's real.
[02:16:29.000 --> 02:16:31.440]   But it was an effective, it worked.
[02:16:31.440 --> 02:16:34.400]   People kind of, it was inappropriate to pretend it's real.
[02:16:34.400 --> 02:16:35.800]   Haven't you watched Guardians of Galaxy?
[02:16:35.800 --> 02:16:37.000]   I assume that that was real.
[02:16:37.000 --> 02:16:38.000]   But then, you know that's fake.
[02:16:38.000 --> 02:16:39.800]   I know that Guardians of the Galaxy.
[02:16:39.800 --> 02:16:43.000]   I might be breaking this to some people, but Guardians of the Galaxy actually is fake
[02:16:43.000 --> 02:16:44.440]   and everyone knows not what's going on.
[02:16:44.440 --> 02:16:47.560]   On the other hand, the Bachelorette pretends to be real.
[02:16:47.560 --> 02:16:48.560]   Is the Bachelorette real?
[02:16:48.560 --> 02:16:49.560]   Yeah.
[02:16:49.560 --> 02:16:50.560]   I'm sick.
[02:16:50.560 --> 02:16:53.760]   But to try to do people emotionally.
[02:16:53.760 --> 02:16:55.480]   It's kind of like emotional extortion.
[02:16:55.480 --> 02:16:57.120]   Like you're like, "Oh yeah, I agree."
[02:16:57.120 --> 02:17:00.480]   "You're like, 'I think that someone's real and then to find out it's not.'
[02:17:00.480 --> 02:17:06.560]   It's just, and then people that do this usually have really complex psyches and needs for
[02:17:06.560 --> 02:17:10.320]   something for that attention as to why they're doing it.
[02:17:10.320 --> 02:17:13.600]   And that's also probably really sad as well because it doesn't go away.
[02:17:13.600 --> 02:17:18.000]   Those are one of those hard personality traits to get out of when you really want to get
[02:17:18.000 --> 02:17:20.800]   attention and you'll get it through this situation.
[02:17:20.800 --> 02:17:25.360]   And then after when you lose it, then you feel this horrible sadness because you're not getting
[02:17:25.360 --> 02:17:30.640]   the attention that you need and crave for whatever reasons in your own childhood and
[02:17:30.640 --> 02:17:33.680]   relationships that you don't have it on itself.
[02:17:33.680 --> 02:17:37.320]   Is that why women are still watching the Bachelorette or the Bachelorette?
[02:17:37.320 --> 02:17:39.920]   Well they're living vicariously through the movie.
[02:17:39.920 --> 02:17:43.600]   No, they're living vicariously through the characters.
[02:17:43.600 --> 02:17:45.800]   So they're getting emotionally involved with the characters.
[02:17:45.800 --> 02:17:50.280]   They're like, "I don't like the Bachelor, but I have to say sorry about that."
[02:17:50.280 --> 02:17:51.280]   That's okay.
[02:17:51.280 --> 02:17:57.360]   I've had doorbells and my schnazers going crazy.
[02:17:57.360 --> 02:17:59.640]   She's actually shit too.
[02:17:59.640 --> 02:18:02.600]   So I understand, I'm emotionally invested in Game of Thrones.
[02:18:02.600 --> 02:18:07.360]   Is that any worse than being emotionally invested to the Bachelor?
[02:18:07.360 --> 02:18:11.160]   By the definition of what you just said, Game of Thrones is fake and I know that's fake.
[02:18:11.160 --> 02:18:16.000]   The Bachelor and the Bachelorette tell me that 37 dudes love one woman and one woman
[02:18:16.000 --> 02:18:19.280]   could love 37 dudes until she gets down to the last two dudes.
[02:18:19.280 --> 02:18:21.480]   The prize gets a rose and then goes on to the other side.
[02:18:21.480 --> 02:18:27.080]   All reality TV is carefully curated to make it more emotional, more interesting.
[02:18:27.080 --> 02:18:29.000]   It's definitely a hoax.
[02:18:29.000 --> 02:18:30.000]   But it does.
[02:18:30.000 --> 02:18:31.000]   It does.
[02:18:31.000 --> 02:18:32.000]   I mean, Survivor too.
[02:18:32.000 --> 02:18:36.400]   It promises, it acts as if, no, this really happened.
[02:18:36.400 --> 02:18:37.880]   But some of it is even scripted.
[02:18:37.880 --> 02:18:39.280]   I mean it's not.
[02:18:39.280 --> 02:18:41.400]   So that's just as disingenuous I guess.
[02:18:41.400 --> 02:18:44.680]   The bad socials and promosities are told through editing to rather than.
[02:18:44.680 --> 02:18:45.680]   A lot of it is.
[02:18:45.680 --> 02:18:48.080]   Yeah, you don't have to script it if you control the edit.
[02:18:48.080 --> 02:18:49.320]   You've got everything you need.
[02:18:49.320 --> 02:18:50.320]   For sure.
[02:18:50.320 --> 02:18:53.880]   Like I don't watch too many reality shows but Project Greenlight the last season that
[02:18:53.880 --> 02:18:55.720]   was on was kind of incredible.
[02:18:55.720 --> 02:18:57.160]   Just like following that along.
[02:18:57.160 --> 02:18:58.160]   Even though I know that wasn't so.
[02:18:58.160 --> 02:18:59.560]   When you're in the movies, that's why.
[02:18:59.560 --> 02:19:01.240]   Yeah, it was so good.
[02:19:01.240 --> 02:19:02.240]   It was good though.
[02:19:02.240 --> 02:19:05.320]   It had a lot of personal personality going on.
[02:19:05.320 --> 02:19:06.320]   Yeah.
[02:19:06.320 --> 02:19:07.320]   It was great.
[02:19:07.320 --> 02:19:08.320]   It was interesting.
[02:19:08.320 --> 02:19:09.720]   I didn't watch it.
[02:19:09.720 --> 02:19:13.160]   It's about what people trying to get greenlighted for their movie, right?
[02:19:13.160 --> 02:19:14.640]   I haven't really watched.
[02:19:14.640 --> 02:19:15.640]   Yeah.
[02:19:15.640 --> 02:19:16.640]   It's basically that.
[02:19:16.640 --> 02:19:22.760]   And independent filmmaker gets the ability to make his movie and kind of follows that
[02:19:22.760 --> 02:19:23.760]   journey.
[02:19:23.760 --> 02:19:25.760]   This season is a little different from some of the others.
[02:19:25.760 --> 02:19:30.360]   I think it says a lot about Hollywood and kind of like how, I don't know, we're approaching
[02:19:30.360 --> 02:19:34.920]   diversity and how we're bad at it and how Hollywood is really terrible at certain things.
[02:19:34.920 --> 02:19:39.320]   And features one of the best young producers out there right now too.
[02:19:39.320 --> 02:19:44.240]   I want to point out a full moon is coming and with it the summer solstice.
[02:19:44.240 --> 02:19:45.440]   This is our last.
[02:19:45.440 --> 02:19:46.440]   That's not it.
[02:19:46.440 --> 02:19:49.040]   That's just a picture of the screen.
[02:19:49.040 --> 02:19:51.280]   And it's, you know what?
[02:19:51.280 --> 02:19:53.000]   Nice job, Brian Burnett.
[02:19:53.000 --> 02:19:57.600]   That really looks like we're looking out and that's what you see that my friends is a
[02:19:57.600 --> 02:19:59.200]   bun to look at the window.
[02:19:59.200 --> 02:20:00.200]   Yeah.
[02:20:00.200 --> 02:20:03.920]   So in 24 hours, it will be summer.
[02:20:03.920 --> 02:20:06.440]   This is our last show of the spring.
[02:20:06.440 --> 02:20:10.680]   I hope you enjoy apparently it's going to be a heat wave in Southern California.
[02:20:10.680 --> 02:20:12.600]   That's why I'm headed down there.
[02:20:12.600 --> 02:20:17.680]   108 degrees tomorrow we're going to do with the Universal Studios.
[02:20:17.680 --> 02:20:19.240]   It's going to be so much fun.
[02:20:19.240 --> 02:20:21.160]   I can't wait.
[02:20:21.160 --> 02:20:23.320]   But I'll be back in time for the show next week.
[02:20:23.320 --> 02:20:24.320]   Don't you worry.
[02:20:24.320 --> 02:20:26.040]   I want to thank you all for being here.
[02:20:26.040 --> 02:20:27.560]   Oh, Dr. Owen J. J. Stone.
[02:20:27.560 --> 02:20:28.840]   Happy Father's Day to you.
[02:20:28.840 --> 02:20:31.520]   And thank you for sharing your beautiful daughter with us.
[02:20:31.520 --> 02:20:32.520]   She's great.
[02:20:32.520 --> 02:20:34.160]   Give me, give me my 30 seconds.
[02:20:34.160 --> 02:20:36.120]   I usually go last when I tell people stuff.
[02:20:36.120 --> 02:20:37.880]   That's why you're going first today.
[02:20:37.880 --> 02:20:38.880]   Going first.
[02:20:38.880 --> 02:20:40.560]   So first of all, happy Father's Day to me.
[02:20:40.560 --> 02:20:42.920]   I'm one of the greatest fathers I've ever walked this planet.
[02:20:42.920 --> 02:20:45.280]   And if you didn't know it, I'm telling you so you could believe that.
[02:20:45.280 --> 02:20:46.280]   I do believe.
[02:20:46.280 --> 02:20:47.520]   Take it to the bank and tell your dad.
[02:20:47.520 --> 02:20:52.840]   Secondly, if you love anybody and you haven't told them that it's 2016, the year of everybody
[02:20:52.840 --> 02:20:56.240]   passing away, call them on the phone and tell them that you love them.
[02:20:56.240 --> 02:21:00.320]   Call your brother, call your best friend, call your semi best friend, call the neighbor
[02:21:00.320 --> 02:21:03.000]   and tell them that you love them because tomorrow is not promised.
[02:21:03.000 --> 02:21:04.960]   It is a dangerous world we live in.
[02:21:04.960 --> 02:21:05.960]   It's true.
[02:21:05.960 --> 02:21:07.720]   Terrorism aside, there's car accidents, there's people passing out.
[02:21:07.720 --> 02:21:08.720]   I'm eating too much pizza.
[02:21:08.720 --> 02:21:10.440]   I might have a heart attack right now.
[02:21:10.440 --> 02:21:13.560]   So tweet me and tell me that you love me and just know that I love you too.
[02:21:13.560 --> 02:21:15.160]   And share that love throughout the world.
[02:21:15.160 --> 02:21:20.840]   We would be so sad if this were your last show ever and I had to come on tomorrow and
[02:21:20.840 --> 02:21:22.760]   say I have some very sad news.
[02:21:22.760 --> 02:21:24.320]   Oh, I would be terrible.
[02:21:24.320 --> 02:21:27.760]   Owen JJ Stone was crushed by a pizza last night.
[02:21:27.760 --> 02:21:31.920]   The best thing about my passing, Uncle Leo, is that I am a national treasure.
[02:21:31.920 --> 02:21:36.200]   And the days that I know, you will have another day off in your year.
[02:21:36.200 --> 02:21:40.400]   So again, reaffirming, call someone I'm telling that you love them.
[02:21:40.400 --> 02:21:41.400]   And do it.
[02:21:41.400 --> 02:21:43.520]   Oh, and you can find out George's real name.
[02:21:43.520 --> 02:21:46.600]   If you listen, yes, I QMC dot com.
[02:21:46.600 --> 02:21:48.600]   I'll just forget.
[02:21:48.600 --> 02:21:53.520]   So nobody forget Kentucky Dow and then Twitter.
[02:21:53.520 --> 02:21:57.120]   All the Southern Bell is going to find out.
[02:21:57.120 --> 02:21:58.120]   Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[02:21:58.120 --> 02:22:01.440]   So you so you implied that Mississippi was really close.
[02:22:01.440 --> 02:22:03.960]   Oh, man, you suck all the Southern States.
[02:22:03.960 --> 02:22:05.520]   All the Southern States.
[02:22:05.520 --> 02:22:06.520]   Let's see.
[02:22:06.520 --> 02:22:07.520]   Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[02:22:07.520 --> 02:22:09.320]   It's not Alabama Dow.
[02:22:09.320 --> 02:22:12.000]   Wait, you see Alabama.
[02:22:12.000 --> 02:22:13.560]   It's better than all those things.
[02:22:13.560 --> 02:22:17.280]   It is so Tennessee Dow.
[02:22:17.280 --> 02:22:18.800]   She looks like a Tennessee.
[02:22:18.800 --> 02:22:20.760]   She does look like a Tennessee.
[02:22:20.760 --> 02:22:21.760]   She should have never told me.
[02:22:21.760 --> 02:22:23.240]   I'm like the worst person.
[02:22:23.240 --> 02:22:24.240]   She should have.
[02:22:24.240 --> 02:22:25.640]   She was like, I've never actually admitted this to anyone.
[02:22:25.640 --> 02:22:27.160]   I'm like, and you're telling me.
[02:22:27.160 --> 02:22:31.640]   Not not just telling you on a with a microphone and a podcast.
[02:22:31.640 --> 02:22:33.760]   I false us as a security.
[02:22:33.760 --> 02:22:37.160]   I make everybody feel good when hanging out with the sugar bear.
[02:22:37.160 --> 02:22:38.160]   Best day in the world.
[02:22:38.160 --> 02:22:39.160]   All right.
[02:22:39.160 --> 02:22:40.160]   It's it's mover.
[02:22:40.160 --> 02:22:45.520]   Was it right from the sign felt right from a sign?
[02:22:45.520 --> 02:22:46.520]   Yeah.
[02:22:46.520 --> 02:22:47.520]   Dolores.
[02:22:47.520 --> 02:22:50.360]   Oh, no, it's got to be Virginia.
[02:22:50.360 --> 02:22:52.000]   It's got to be Virginia.
[02:22:52.000 --> 02:22:54.200]   Is you wait till you Georgia?
[02:22:54.200 --> 02:22:55.200]   Wait, Chechnya.

[02:22:59.760 --> 02:23:00.760]   Uzbekistan Dow.

[02:24:18.760 --> 02:24:20.240]   Not like not my smartest.
[02:24:20.240 --> 02:24:23.760]   And by the way, not many people know this, but the vendor's real name is Sam.
[02:24:23.760 --> 02:24:25.720]   Yes, very simple.
[02:24:25.720 --> 02:24:27.240]   The vendor, Harder, War.
[02:24:27.240 --> 02:24:28.240]   Yeah.
[02:24:28.240 --> 02:24:30.920]   Great to have you senior editor and Engadget magazine.
[02:24:30.920 --> 02:24:34.400]   Anything exciting you anything you want to warn us about?
[02:24:34.400 --> 02:24:37.400]   That's coming down the pike, exciting, fresh, hot news stuff.
[02:24:37.400 --> 02:24:38.400]   Coming down the pike.
[02:24:38.400 --> 02:24:41.600]   I mean, I feel like we just went through a big wave of news, right?
[02:24:41.600 --> 02:24:42.600]   We did.
[02:24:42.600 --> 02:24:43.600]   We did.
[02:24:43.600 --> 02:24:45.000]   All of E3, like there's just so much stuff.
[02:24:45.000 --> 02:24:49.200]   So I we're going to have some reviews.
[02:24:49.200 --> 02:24:53.640]   Maybe maybe some of the stuff we saw at Computex actually, some of those aces Zen book.
[02:24:53.640 --> 02:24:54.640]   Oh, I like those.
[02:24:54.640 --> 02:24:55.640]   I love those.
[02:24:55.640 --> 02:24:56.640]   That thing looks cool.
[02:24:56.640 --> 02:25:01.520]   I felt it was super, super light, just really thin as as light is the Mac book with a core
[02:25:01.520 --> 02:25:03.920]   I five and core I said, I also should kind of insane.
[02:25:03.920 --> 02:25:07.440]   I could point out that Google said that we would get the Google Play Store, the Android
[02:25:07.440 --> 02:25:12.360]   software in June on at least three Chromebooks, including the Pixel.
[02:25:12.360 --> 02:25:13.360]   And I'm waiting to see that.
[02:25:13.360 --> 02:25:16.920]   I wouldn't be surprised if sometime this week that it's on one of them right now.
[02:25:16.920 --> 02:25:17.920]   Is it out now?
[02:25:17.920 --> 02:25:19.480]   Yeah, it's on one laptop.
[02:25:19.480 --> 02:25:20.480]   I think it's an Acer.
[02:25:20.480 --> 02:25:21.480]   I can't.
[02:25:21.480 --> 02:25:22.480]   It's not weird.
[02:25:22.480 --> 02:25:23.480]   It's not on the Pixel.
[02:25:23.480 --> 02:25:24.480]   You'd think it'd be on there.
[02:25:24.480 --> 02:25:26.640]   Yeah, it's I can imagine they're going to roll that out soon.
[02:25:26.640 --> 02:25:30.960]   But you know, everyone's just sitting tight and waiting for like, you know, the impending
[02:25:30.960 --> 02:25:33.880]   Apple announcements in the fall.
[02:25:33.880 --> 02:25:36.200]   Hopefully we can have like a calm summer, I think.
[02:25:36.200 --> 02:25:37.200]   I think so.
[02:25:37.200 --> 02:25:38.200]   We're going to relax.
[02:25:38.200 --> 02:25:39.200]   Yeah.
[02:25:39.200 --> 02:25:40.200]   Thank you all for being here.
[02:25:40.200 --> 02:25:41.200]   We had great studio audience.
[02:25:41.200 --> 02:25:42.200]   You guys are fantastic.
[02:25:42.200 --> 02:25:46.440]   If you want to be in the studio, I'll just email tickets@twit.tv and we'll be glad to
[02:25:46.440 --> 02:25:47.600]   put a chair out for you.
[02:25:47.600 --> 02:25:51.080]   If you can't be here in person, you can always watch a stream live.
[02:25:51.080 --> 02:25:56.080]   Everything we do is stream live at twit.tv/live or live.twit.tv.
[02:25:56.080 --> 02:25:58.280]   And this particular show is Saturday after it's 3 p.m.
[02:25:58.280 --> 02:26:01.280]   Pacific 6 p.m. Eastern time 22 Sundays.
[02:26:01.280 --> 02:26:02.680]   Did I say Saturday?
[02:26:02.680 --> 02:26:08.600]   I'm sorry, Sunday afternoon 3 p.m. Pacific 6 p.m. Eastern time 2200 UTC.
[02:26:08.600 --> 02:26:10.000]   You can also get all the shows on the main.
[02:26:10.000 --> 02:26:13.040]   If you're as confused as I am about when we do these things, no problem.
[02:26:13.040 --> 02:26:18.400]   Just go to twit.tv and you'll find all our shows or subscribe in your favorite pod catcher
[02:26:18.400 --> 02:26:22.280]   and you'll be able to listen each and every week and I hope you will.
[02:26:22.280 --> 02:26:23.880]   Thank you for joining us and we'll see you next time.
[02:26:23.880 --> 02:26:25.880]   Another twit is in the can.
[02:26:25.880 --> 02:26:26.880]   Bye bye everybody.
[02:26:26.880 --> 02:26:27.880]   Thank you.
[02:26:27.880 --> 02:26:28.880]   Thank you.
[02:26:28.880 --> 02:26:39.280]   Bye bye.
