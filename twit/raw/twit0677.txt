[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:45.600]   It's time for this week in Tech the show where we talk about the week's tech news.
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:49.800]   And I always like to rotate the panels just so we get new fresh voices on.
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.480]   Sometimes we want the classics.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:53.240]   Yes.
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:55.560]   Today it's the classics baby.
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:59.720]   Mike Elgin is here temporarily in residence in the United States.
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:01.120]   It's always a pleasure to have you.
[00:02:01.120 --> 00:02:04.120]   When you rotated me before the show it was less painful than I thought.
[00:02:04.120 --> 00:02:07.680]   I think we're too dumb to know Mike, but I think he called us old.
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:08.760]   I think he's a classic.
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:10.720]   I think it's a euphemism is a brawl.
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:13.360]   Talk about classic Jason Gallicand.
[00:02:13.360 --> 00:02:16.480]   I'm going to have you from inside.com. It's really nice to see you.
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:20.720]   You haven't been here in ages, but I think it's because you've been very, very busy lately.
[00:02:20.720 --> 00:02:21.520]   A little bit. Yeah.
[00:02:21.520 --> 00:02:23.000]   The book tour is taken over my life.
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:24.840]   So it's still touring for start.
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:25.760]   Now it was the one year.
[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:26.760]   Oh, that's angel.
[00:02:26.760 --> 00:02:27.240]   Angel.
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:27.440]   Yeah.
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.720]   So the one year ended, but now it did so well.
[00:02:30.720 --> 00:02:32.800]   Got a lot of great reviews.
[00:02:32.800 --> 00:02:36.040]   More people listen to it on Audible, which was pretty fascinating.
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:36.840]   That's how we read it.
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:37.280]   Yeah.
[00:02:37.280 --> 00:02:38.440]   I think four times is.
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:40.720]   I think one of the reasons is.
[00:02:41.560 --> 00:02:44.760]   I know you. So when I read the book, I hear your voice.
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:45.080]   Right.
[00:02:45.080 --> 00:02:49.360]   But really, if you don't know, Jason, you want to hear it in his voice.
[00:02:49.360 --> 00:02:49.840]   I agree.
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.520]   And they tried to stop me from doing it.
[00:02:51.520 --> 00:02:52.200]   Oh, no, that's not.
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:57.320]   Inside baseball, they're like, well, as a Harper business, like, so we found these incredible choice.
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:59.440]   We have three different voice over talent.
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:03.080]   And this one did this friend of yours book and this one did Tim Ferriss's book and this one did this
[00:03:03.080 --> 00:03:04.280]   prize book, whatever it was.
[00:03:04.280 --> 00:03:05.200]   I was like, no, I'm going to read it.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:06.200]   My people want to hear my voice.
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.120]   And they're like, yeah, no, we think it should be this.
[00:03:08.120 --> 00:03:10.160]   And I was like, why are you just waiting me?
[00:03:10.160 --> 00:03:11.440]   And do you think I'm going to suck?
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:16.000]   They're like, well, maybe I was like, all right, I'll do one day.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.120]   If I suck, then throw it away and then I'm the other person.
[00:03:20.120 --> 00:03:21.640]   I'm self aware. And then we did.
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:23.760]   And it was OK, but it's more than OK.
[00:03:23.760 --> 00:03:25.360]   It has to be in your voice.
[00:03:25.360 --> 00:03:27.720]   It would be it would be a huge mistake.
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.720]   I mean, there are plenty of people authors who should not read their books.
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:32.200]   Yeah, right.
[00:03:32.200 --> 00:03:33.760]   And that's and I can understand.
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:37.920]   I mean, if I were your publisher and I listened to your voice, I would say, oh, no way is reading that.
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:41.760]   But but it's a distinctive voice.
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.480]   Right. And and and the style of the writing is distinctive.
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:47.320]   So it has to match.
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:50.880]   And also the book, it's about it's advice, right?
[00:03:50.880 --> 00:03:53.040]   It's take it's timeless advice from an angel investor.
[00:03:53.040 --> 00:03:54.920]   How do I invest in technology startups?
[00:03:54.920 --> 00:03:57.040]   You want it to be from you.
[00:03:57.040 --> 00:04:00.600]   We don't want some guy to say, let me tell you how I made money.
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:05.680]   You want it to be Jason telling you in your ear how he made money.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.320]   Lisa and I listened to it and it's great.
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:10.360]   We listen to it in the car all the time.
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:11.720]   It's just I wrote it myself.
[00:04:11.720 --> 00:04:12.440]   That was the other nature.
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:16.320]   They were like, so tell us writing the book and I'm like, what do you mean?
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:18.920]   Like, we have somebody who wrote your friend's book, wink.
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:21.720]   We won't tell you who this guy and nudge, nudge.
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:24.360]   And I was like, I want to F that.
[00:04:24.360 --> 00:04:25.360]   I want to write it myself.
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:26.600]   So it's it's hard.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:27.800]   Was that a pain in the ass?
[00:04:27.800 --> 00:04:29.960]   It's very I have to say, it's very lonely process.
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.480]   So what I did was I've written books.
[00:04:31.480 --> 00:04:33.200]   I'm never going to ever ever do it again.
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:35.560]   I have a total solution writer, writer, coach.
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.640]   OK, so what I did was I hired my friend Brian
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:39.840]   Avi who did Weblogs, Inc with me.
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:42.200]   And I said, just come over the house 20 days.
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:44.440]   I'll pay you this dollar amount per day per chapter.
[00:04:44.440 --> 00:04:48.760]   And I'll write in the morning and you read it and we'll go for a walk.
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:52.040]   We'll have lunch and then we'll write or clean it up and talk about more topics.
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.880]   So we did that for 19 days and we got, you know, to 50,000 words.
[00:04:55.880 --> 00:04:58.040]   And then we just did a four day sprint and got to 65.
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:04:58.520]   So what is it?
[00:04:58.520 --> 00:04:59.440]   Crack a whip.
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:05:04.240]   It was more like having a coach like watch you and say, this is boring.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:05.520]   This is really good.
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.880]   In real time, in real time, every day.
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:10.480]   So what happened was, I asked you to do that.
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:12.480]   And I hired my wife.
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:13.560]   My great editor.
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:13.920]   Yeah.
[00:05:13.920 --> 00:05:15.880]   You need to have somebody you enjoy spending time with.
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:19.600]   I picked the person I love spending time with, you know, outside of my wife and my kids.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.280]   I wanted to take you to write about 19, 20 days of primary writing.
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:25.960]   And then another 10, 20 days of like all day.
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:29.520]   I mean, you go six hour days after about five or six hours.
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:32.000]   The main job that day was five or six hours.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:34.080]   I can write two, three thousand words in a sitting.
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:34.680]   Yeah.
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:39.200]   I have a specific, if you're an expert on something, then you can do it in that amount of time.
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.760]   But if you are Michael Lewis and you're researching something, I talk to Michael.
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:43.760]   Oh, he must take years.
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:48.000]   He spends 18 months researching something and it takes him a year to find a project.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:48.440]   Exactly.
[00:05:48.440 --> 00:05:49.920]   So it's two years of finding a project.
[00:05:49.920 --> 00:05:51.320]   And then he told me, oh, yeah, I read it in six months.
[00:05:51.320 --> 00:05:51.520]   Yeah.
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:51.600]   Right.
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:52.080]   In three months.
[00:05:52.080 --> 00:05:54.000]   If you're a journalist, you don't really know anything.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:55.960]   You, it's like this whole word.
[00:05:55.960 --> 00:05:56.720]   Yeah.
[00:05:56.720 --> 00:05:59.640]   Yeah, that's be careful when you say that.
[00:05:59.640 --> 00:06:02.200]   No, but you, you know, this idea of running about an area of X.
[00:06:02.200 --> 00:06:03.680]   You don't see that type, right?
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:05.280]   Like, like you know something you just write it.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:05.960]   You should write one on broadcasting.
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:06.120]   Yeah.
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.120]   Yeah.
[00:06:06.120 --> 00:06:06.640]   Exactly.
[00:06:06.640 --> 00:06:10.160]   I think a book where you just did a book called "Brukcaster" and you just talk about your
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:14.760]   experience as broadcasting from the first person, what you believe would be incredible
[00:06:14.760 --> 00:06:15.560]   for all these new podcasts.
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:17.880]   I don't know why, but writing is so painful for me.
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:20.200]   I don't know why his publisher has a guy.
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:21.600]   A guy.
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.280]   I did actually, you know, I only wrote the first couple of three, uh, Leela
[00:06:25.280 --> 00:06:26.400]   Port's tech on the next.
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:29.600]   And after that, I got a guy because it just was too much.
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:32.720]   I, I write, I write in the last, since 1990, I've written.
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:36.120]   Probably 25,000 articles or something like that.
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.840]   So much easier to write books than articles.
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:42.080]   So in a way though, that means your muscle is, is that I have, it just,
[00:06:42.080 --> 00:06:44.760]   highly refined way to do nonfiction.
[00:06:44.760 --> 00:06:45.040]   Yeah.
[00:06:45.040 --> 00:06:50.360]   And just, it's just so, and, and you know, for, for both, like the, I think the biggest
[00:06:50.360 --> 00:06:52.720]   mistake people make is they have this elaborate system.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:55.640]   They use Scrivener and they do all the stuff and they move and stuff around.
[00:06:55.640 --> 00:06:59.760]   And the management of the blocks of ideas is the hardest part actually.
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:01.000]   And the collection.
[00:07:01.520 --> 00:07:03.840]   So I strip it down to nothing.
[00:07:03.840 --> 00:07:05.760]   I spend half the time on an outline.
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:07.600]   I do like a supreme outline.
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.680]   So the outline is the book.
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:10.000]   Right.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:11.200]   And you're just filling it.
[00:07:11.200 --> 00:07:14.680]   And then I just go step one and I just, it's, it's a, you have to realize it's not an art.
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:15.200]   It's a craft.
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:24.280]   You just go down and you sit down and you're like, okay, this one, you know, one, a X or whatever is, it's like a column.
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.040]   It's, it's going to be 1500 words.
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:27.440]   It's going to be 3000 words.
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.000]   And that's all I'm doing.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:29.680]   You're chucking it.
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:30.040]   Yeah.
[00:07:30.040 --> 00:07:30.480]   Chucking it.
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:31.000]   It makes it.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:33.680]   The outline is everything because then you, you never lose track.
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.520]   It's like herding cats.
[00:07:34.520 --> 00:07:36.160]   You never lose track of the pieces.
[00:07:36.160 --> 00:07:37.920]   That's, that's how coding works too.
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:40.040]   There are many coders and it's a bad habit.
[00:07:40.040 --> 00:07:41.560]   We'll just sit down and start typing code.
[00:07:41.560 --> 00:07:43.600]   That's the worst possible thing you can do.
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:48.520]   And you 90% of your time should be spent writing the outline in effect.
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:48.960]   I mean, you're right.
[00:07:48.960 --> 00:07:54.600]   translated by the fiction people who just, they say there's some great fiction writers who are like, I don't know what the, how it's going to end.
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.880]   And I don't know the characters.
[00:07:55.880 --> 00:07:56.440]   They like that.
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:07:57.680]   I just know these like sports teams.
[00:07:57.720 --> 00:08:01.320]   They like that because then they actually live in this world and it's developing.
[00:08:01.320 --> 00:08:01.960]   And they just see where it goes.
[00:08:01.960 --> 00:08:02.920]   I'm like, wow, really?
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:03.320]   That's good.
[00:08:03.320 --> 00:08:05.160]   I tell you to have to be with opinion columns.
[00:08:05.160 --> 00:08:06.880]   I start writing column and I don't know how it's going to end.
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:07.440]   I have no idea.
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:08.400]   I can't wait to find out.
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:08.600]   Right.
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:08.720]   Yeah.
[00:08:08.720 --> 00:08:10.680]   What do I really think?
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:14.680]   So Jason is, so your primary job these days is.
[00:08:14.680 --> 00:08:16.240]   I do two things.
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:20.320]   I run inside.com, which is 30 email newsletters doing really well.
[00:08:20.320 --> 00:08:20.600]   30.
[00:08:20.600 --> 00:08:21.720]   You were doing a text to.
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:22.680]   Did you stop doing that?
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:26.120]   We're doing text to that's inside alerts and it's working pretty well.
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:29.840]   It's a much more intimate thing to text people news all day.
[00:08:29.840 --> 00:08:34.120]   So like 2% of the subscriber base is testing it right now.
[00:08:34.120 --> 00:08:36.920]   But we have to be very careful because it's a totally different product.
[00:08:36.920 --> 00:08:38.600]   Just that in text news to people.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:42.360]   But the people who don't like 20% of people immediately unsubscribed.
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:43.240]   They're like, I don't want to.
[00:08:43.240 --> 00:08:43.480]   Too much.
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:46.440]   The ones who don't unsubscribe the open rate is 100%.
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:46.680]   Right.
[00:08:46.680 --> 00:08:47.120]   Exactly.
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:47.320]   Yeah.
[00:08:47.320 --> 00:08:47.680]   You're not.
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:48.720]   Nobody ignores a text.
[00:08:48.720 --> 00:08:52.880]   And then the other half of my time I invest in 40, 50 companies a year.
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:55.800]   And I've got 11 people at launch who manage that process.
[00:08:55.920 --> 00:08:57.720]   So that's the angel investing.
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:58.240]   That's the angel.
[00:08:58.240 --> 00:09:00.520]   And what is what defines angel investing?
[00:09:00.520 --> 00:09:00.920]   What makes angel?
[00:09:00.920 --> 00:09:05.120]   So in the early days, an angel investor was somebody who invested their own money,
[00:09:05.120 --> 00:09:09.760]   typically with very little information other than the back of the envelope.
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:10.520]   Here's my idea.
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:12.440]   Now it's become a profession.
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:16.200]   So 10 years ago, when I started angel investing, or eight, yeah, 2008, when I
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:19.520]   invested in Uber, Thumbtack and a lot of those kind of interesting companies,
[00:09:19.520 --> 00:09:23.920]   when I started investing, then there were maybe two dozen angel investors that
[00:09:23.920 --> 00:09:27.720]   were known before angel lists in San Francisco.
[00:09:27.720 --> 00:09:30.880]   And then there were a couple in New York, like Esther Dyson, it was just very few,
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:32.400]   like three or four in Boston.
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:37.920]   And now it's become 10, 20,000 people globally are doing this.
[00:09:37.920 --> 00:09:40.520]   That's why I wrote the book in our syndicate.
[00:09:40.520 --> 00:09:44.280]   So I have a syndicate, Jason syndicate.com where if we like a deal and we're
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:47.800]   putting a hundred thousand in, we'll invite up to 250 other people can be in
[00:09:47.800 --> 00:09:53.480]   the LLC with us in what's called an SPV and put in two thousand to, you know,
[00:09:53.480 --> 00:09:56.440]   a hundred thousand each, and then we'll invest a million dollars or a million
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:09:56.800]   a half.
[00:09:56.800 --> 00:09:59.560]   So you don't have to be loaded anymore to be an angel investor.
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:03.320]   No, you could put 2550 can yourself and then have a syndicate where that
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:06.320]   then backs into investing in a company.
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:07.880]   All the details of this are an angel.
[00:10:07.880 --> 00:10:09.000]   All of them in the book.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.040]   It's actually a highly recommend if you think this is something you might want
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:17.160]   to look at because you've got a strategy, you've got a plan, you've got a way of
[00:10:17.160 --> 00:10:20.280]   trying it before you really get into it.
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:23.440]   And your rules are very concrete and I think very sensible.
[00:10:23.440 --> 00:10:24.760]   So I think this is a good way to start.
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:27.400]   I mean, the big mistake people make is they invest in the user.
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:30.640]   Yeah, they use their invest in their cousins, roommates, friend.
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:34.480]   And if they were going to invest 500,000, their angel investing career, they give
[00:10:34.480 --> 00:10:36.280]   them 250 before they've even launched the product.
[00:10:36.280 --> 00:10:38.320]   And then the product never gets launched.
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:38.680]   Right.
[00:10:38.680 --> 00:10:42.000]   And then they want the other 250 that you've got and you're a hundred thousand
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:42.880]   right. You go, this is stupid.
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:43.320]   Yeah.
[00:10:43.320 --> 00:10:45.480]   So in the book, I kind of outlined how to not make those mistakes.
[00:10:45.480 --> 00:10:46.320]   Really good stuff.
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:47.400]   Thanks, Mike.
[00:10:47.400 --> 00:10:49.760]   You're still writing for magazines.
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:51.880]   You've got the book, which is great at Gastronomad.
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:55.840]   And of course, you and Amira are doing the Gastronomad experience.
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:10:57.160]   Your next one is in September.
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:10:58.600]   It is. Yeah.
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:01.800]   October, I believe in Italy, Gastronomad.
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:02.680]   Yeah.
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:05.640]   And in fact, this wine here, this is Feto.
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:09.880]   This is one of the wines, this winemaker, the woman who makes this wine is an absolute
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:10.880]   genius.
[00:11:10.880 --> 00:11:11.720]   And what is this?
[00:11:11.720 --> 00:11:12.160]   Feto.
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:12.640]   Feto.
[00:11:12.640 --> 00:11:17.520]   It's a white wine made with it's actually, she calls it an amber wine.
[00:11:17.520 --> 00:11:19.600]   It's an orange wine, but deeply orange.
[00:11:20.240 --> 00:11:22.000]   It's made with white manzoni grapes.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.480]   Anyway, there's a lot of innovation.
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:27.840]   The reason you have to go to Italy to try some of these wines is some of the best
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.280]   wines in the world are never exported.
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:30.000]   Small.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:31.560]   Right. You can't buy this in the US.
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.600]   And so, yeah.
[00:11:33.600 --> 00:11:39.880]   And and so this is a this is a this is so orange that it's actually like it looks
[00:11:39.880 --> 00:11:40.320]   like amber.
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:41.000]   Can't wait to try.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.520]   Is it a fruity, sweeter?
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:44.080]   No, it's it's dry.
[00:11:44.080 --> 00:11:47.120]   It actually has hints of whiskey and caramel.
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:49.160]   It's completely off the charts.
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:50.400]   Welcome to broadcast.
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:50.920]   Yes.
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:51.760]   What is this?
[00:11:51.760 --> 00:11:54.440]   What's for tell me a little bit about this wine that you have.
[00:11:54.440 --> 00:11:58.960]   Also the vodka car is from the region of Champagne to be true.
[00:11:58.960 --> 00:11:59.560]   Champagne.
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:01.640]   You must be from the region of Champagne.
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:03.200]   You know, it's funny that you brought champagne.
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.960]   I brought champagne too, but my mind's my bottle is a lot bigger than yours.
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:07.440]   It is.
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:07.920]   It is.
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:09.200]   It is bottle of champagne.
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:11.160]   And it's also a lot cheaper than yours.
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:11.400]   Yeah.
[00:12:11.400 --> 00:12:12.320]   About.
[00:12:12.320 --> 00:12:15.840]   I think yours is sparkle of wine technically.
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:16.960]   Yeah, technically I don't think it's.
[00:12:16.960 --> 00:12:18.320]   It's a sparkling wine from California.
[00:12:18.320 --> 00:12:21.000]   It's nice, but it is not Champagne.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   We bought this back when we did New Year's Eve 24 hour New Year's Eve.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.480]   We bought one for every hour.
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:25.880]   Nice.
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:27.040]   And they were only $10.
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:28.720]   So we figured that's a deal.
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:33.160]   Are you not living like a, do you get rid of your home and you're like full nomad?
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:34.640]   So we've done that before.
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:37.720]   So we've been doing this for 12 years, except the two years that I was at Twit.
[00:12:37.720 --> 00:12:38.240]   Yeah.
[00:12:38.240 --> 00:12:41.040]   And we did that for like six years.
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:42.320]   It had no home here.
[00:12:42.320 --> 00:12:43.440]   Now we have a small home base.
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:46.040]   We basically split it with my one of my sons.
[00:12:46.040 --> 00:12:46.560]   Uh huh.
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:50.360]   And so we store all our stuff there and we have a room there when we want to visit him
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:50.920]   and stuff like that.
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:56.680]   So we kind of sort of have a home base, but yeah, we travel at least six months of the
[00:12:56.680 --> 00:12:57.960]   year where abroad somewhere.
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:01.360]   So this yeah, so if you want to check it out, gastronomad.net.
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:01.560]   Right now.
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:01.920]   Yeah.
[00:13:01.920 --> 00:13:04.040]   It's the greatest thing ever.
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:06.000]   Obviously it's technology enabled.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.360]   People talk about how technology changes your life.
[00:13:08.360 --> 00:13:11.160]   This is how technology can really change your life.
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:16.160]   You can go live anywhere you want unless you made the mistake of having a podcast network
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.520]   that does HD video.
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:18.680]   You can live anyway.
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:20.240]   Yeah.
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:21.720]   Only we hadn't gone with HD.
[00:13:21.720 --> 00:13:22.880]   What does it say?
[00:13:22.880 --> 00:13:24.040]   Yeah, but you're right.
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:26.840]   If it were just audio, yeah, we could do it anyway.
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:27.400]   Yeah.
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:28.320]   You still do your podcast.
[00:13:28.320 --> 00:13:31.000]   I've got the video with 98% of people.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:31.960]   Nobody was listening.
[00:13:31.960 --> 00:13:32.800]   Nobody watches it.
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:35.240]   They watch it, then they hit tab and they, you know, do work.
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:35.760]   Yeah.
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.360]   I don't for me, I don't think video was a huge mistake.
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:38.600]   Only.
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.240]   No, I don't think it was a mistake at all, actually.
[00:13:40.240 --> 00:13:40.480]   Yeah.
[00:13:40.480 --> 00:13:42.800]   It's distinct distinguishes us from others.
[00:13:42.800 --> 00:13:44.000]   What percentage?
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:45.520]   Like 25% 20%?
[00:13:45.520 --> 00:13:46.400]   Depending on the show.
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:46.760]   Yeah.
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:47.960]   Some shows 60%.
[00:13:47.960 --> 00:13:48.120]   Yeah.
[00:13:48.120 --> 00:13:52.080]   So, I mean, the people who are watching the video, and with your big audience, that's a lot of people,
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:53.120]   that they love it.
[00:13:53.120 --> 00:13:53.960]   That's why they watch.
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:54.760]   That's the main reason.
[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:58.560]   I think it develops a bond between watching on your Apple TV, big screen TV.
[00:13:58.560 --> 00:14:02.160]   Most people probably don't watch every show, but when they watch once in a while,
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:04.440]   they get a sense of space and place and people.
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:07.920]   You also have to, you wonder if it's the super fans who are watching.
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:11.440]   You want to thrill your, your, your most passionate fans.
[00:14:11.440 --> 00:14:15.280]   And I don't know if that's true or not, but it's, it seems reasonable to me.
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:16.480]   Do you make a living off this?
[00:14:16.480 --> 00:14:17.760]   And do you have a Patreon page?
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:20.160]   So, so they all, I'm sorry.
[00:14:20.160 --> 00:14:20.440]   Go ahead.
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:20.960]   Yeah.
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:25.760]   You're like, no, I just, everybody said, I, I, you SBC cable.
[00:14:25.760 --> 00:14:28.080]   All my money's gone.
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:31.400]   So, so the gas and automatic experience is my wife's new business.
[00:14:31.400 --> 00:14:32.280]   We've done three.
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:33.520]   They've been very successful.
[00:14:33.520 --> 00:14:35.880]   You go on a trip with a bunch of people.
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:36.440]   So weak.
[00:14:36.440 --> 00:14:39.320]   So we all live in a big, like beautiful farmhouse.
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:40.680]   Big experiences on that page.
[00:14:40.680 --> 00:14:40.960]   Yeah.
[00:14:40.960 --> 00:14:44.960]   And, and we get like 10, you know, we get between six and 10 people.
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:45.280]   Yeah.
[00:14:45.280 --> 00:14:47.840]   We all just go and my wife's a genius at finding like
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:49.320]   visionaries who do food stuff.
[00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:53.000]   So we go and we make bread, we make cheese, then we taste cheese, then we make wine,
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:54.800]   then we taste wine, we do all this stuff.
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:14:56.280]   And this is the Italian.
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:03.080]   It's just a week of pure joy, fun, late night dinners, gatherings with locals.
[00:15:03.080 --> 00:15:04.680]   We have a lot of friends in these places.
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:05.200]   Just did this in Spain.
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:08.320]   I rented a farmhouse, like a castle on the top of the hill.
[00:15:08.320 --> 00:15:09.160]   It wasn't very expensive.
[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:10.080]   It had like six bedrooms.
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:10.400]   Yeah.
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:12.760]   I've had a bunch of people and do a bunch of activities.
[00:15:12.760 --> 00:15:12.960]   Yeah.
[00:15:12.960 --> 00:15:13.600]   Such a great.
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:14.000]   We did.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   We did.
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:14.600]   We did one.
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:15.080]   We did one.
[00:15:15.080 --> 00:15:18.080]   Well, in the Provence, everybody loves lavender.
[00:15:18.080 --> 00:15:21.840]   And we did one in Provence that was completely surrounded in all directions by
[00:15:21.840 --> 00:15:23.000]   endless fields of lavender.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.160]   So this thing was this beautiful farmhouse and it was just heaven on earth.
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:29.800]   And this is what we do.
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:31.520]   It's like, yeah, super fun.
[00:15:31.520 --> 00:15:34.440]   But no, I don't make a living on this too much.
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:36.000]   It's mostly my writing.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.400]   Mike's independently wealthier.
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:39.560]   He could never do all the things he does.
[00:15:39.560 --> 00:15:42.800]   Well, I don't, you know, this is the, this is the, I'm living off the
[00:15:42.800 --> 00:15:43.640]   twit residual.
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:48.240]   This is the thing with the, with the, I talk about this in the book.
[00:15:48.240 --> 00:15:52.600]   There's a whole economic reality to living nomadically that is just fantastic.
[00:15:52.600 --> 00:15:57.880]   Namely, in a nutshell, when you are living in a house, your expenses and costs are
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:59.520]   more or less fixed or rising.
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:00.000]   But aware.
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:00.160]   Yeah.
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:06.960]   And your, and your, your income can just go away or it can double or like it's, your
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:09.760]   income is like this and your costs are stable.
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:14.200]   When you're nomadic, the, the cost can be as flexible as your income.
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:17.720]   So if you want to launch a business, if you're an entrepreneur and you like, how do I
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:18.240]   raise the money?
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:23.760]   Well, one way is you go to Ecuador for a year, your cost of living is $12,000 a year.
[00:16:23.760 --> 00:16:24.000]   Right.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   And you take all the rest of the money that you would have spent on a house in a car
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.640]   and an insurance, and most people go to Chiang Mai.
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:32.800]   The reason why is the cheapest place to live?
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:34.280]   Cause I'm moving there.
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:37.400]   Probably Afghanistan.
[00:16:37.880 --> 00:16:41.920]   Yeah, I don't want to go, I get a cave in Torobora, but I don't want to live there.
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:43.640]   So where's this safe place?
[00:16:43.640 --> 00:16:45.040]   Here's, here's a great place.
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:45.960]   Madagascar.
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:48.920]   Madagascar is, you get this is on your page.
[00:16:48.920 --> 00:16:49.120]   Yes.
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:56.600]   You're nomadic that that Madagascar has their average internet connection speed is equal to the US.
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:57.800]   All right.
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:03.600]   And the cost of living, yeah, the cost of living is about 8% of the cost of living.
[00:17:03.600 --> 00:17:06.480]   At this point, this is entirely hypothetical.
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:07.680]   You haven't actually gone there.
[00:17:07.680 --> 00:17:09.480]   No, but we're going to, we're going to go.
[00:17:09.480 --> 00:17:12.120]   But we have been for all we know they have malaria.
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:13.240]   I mean, we don't.
[00:17:13.240 --> 00:17:14.200]   Well, it's Madagascar.
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:17.320]   So it's, it's, it's, you know, the crime rate's low.
[00:17:17.320 --> 00:17:19.280]   It's lowish by average.
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:19.880]   There's low.
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:22.080]   It's it's it's lower than San Jose.
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:23.120]   Let's put it that way.
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:23.920]   Yeah.
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:25.880]   It's cheap to live cheap to live.
[00:17:25.880 --> 00:17:26.840]   How's medical care?
[00:17:26.840 --> 00:17:28.440]   Uh, I don't know.
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:30.600]   See, for me, that's an issue because I'm an old man.
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:31.040]   Yeah.
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:32.880]   I can bring it up.
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:37.440]   But yeah, but if you bring up, yeah, WebMD, it just comes up like that.
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:44.120]   But a lot of the great developers are living this lifestyle where they are remote workers.
[00:17:44.120 --> 00:17:44.400]   Right.
[00:17:44.400 --> 00:17:50.560]   They do a six month to two year stint for a company and they get paid 10 grand a month, 15 grand a month.
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:51.680]   So they're getting paid well.
[00:17:51.680 --> 00:17:51.960]   Yeah.
[00:17:51.960 --> 00:17:53.400]   And then their expenses are nothing.
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:53.560]   Right.
[00:17:53.560 --> 00:17:55.160]   And they, they work to live.
[00:17:55.160 --> 00:17:56.440]   They don't live to work.
[00:17:56.440 --> 00:17:56.720]   Right.
[00:17:56.720 --> 00:18:00.960]   And it's really interesting, as young generation, if you're going to get them to work at your company, right?
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:07.400]   If you said I'll pay you X amount or X 80% of X with two more weeks vacation, they were all
[00:18:07.400 --> 00:18:08.400]   take the two more weeks vacation.
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:08.600]   Absolutely.
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:13.720]   So you have to adjust as a gen X or a baby boomer to this new generation that they just care
[00:18:13.720 --> 00:18:18.160]   more about having Friday off to go to Coachella than their work or their raise or their stock
[00:18:18.160 --> 00:18:23.680]   and also their options were developers go and they live on a sailboat for a month or there
[00:18:23.680 --> 00:18:26.680]   are like these, all these new businesses that bring together developers.
[00:18:26.680 --> 00:18:29.440]   They also add training to it, stuff like that.
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:30.120]   Yeah, I've seen that.
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:30.800]   It's pretty interesting.
[00:18:30.800 --> 00:18:32.320]   I'm moving to Reunion Island.
[00:18:32.320 --> 00:18:33.960]   It's a French colony.
[00:18:33.960 --> 00:18:36.960]   It's easy to get to Paris from.
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:40.560]   I'm moving to Peter Gilles, the center of.
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.560]   Unfortunately, the lunacy.
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:45.520]   We always go to the expensive places though, mostly.
[00:18:45.520 --> 00:18:46.480]   You can.
[00:18:46.480 --> 00:18:47.320]   That's the problem.
[00:18:47.320 --> 00:18:48.880]   The places people want to be.
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:53.520]   I paid eight euros for an espresso in Switzerland.
[00:18:53.520 --> 00:18:54.720]   It is an expensive country.
[00:18:54.720 --> 00:18:55.320]   What a Norway.
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:18:56.000]   Really?
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:56.600]   It's even worse.
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:57.240]   It's on bonkers.
[00:18:57.240 --> 00:18:57.680]   Yeah.
[00:18:57.680 --> 00:18:59.000]   And well, Norway has a trillion.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.920]   They found all this oil off of Norway.
[00:19:01.920 --> 00:19:05.080]   They have a trillion dollar and growing sovereign wealth fund.
[00:19:05.080 --> 00:19:08.840]   So every single citizen, I think there's maybe nine or 10 million in Norway,
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:15.760]   gets a portion of that, belongs to the citizens and the minimum wage of skyrocketed.
[00:19:15.760 --> 00:19:16.560]   Everything is skyrocketed.
[00:19:16.560 --> 00:19:17.840]   So the inflation is bonkers.
[00:19:17.840 --> 00:19:21.440]   I think instead of giving them money from the oil business, they should just give them the oil.
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:23.080]   Like roll up with drunk for oil.
[00:19:23.080 --> 00:19:24.280]   It's like a drum each.
[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:24.480]   Right.
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.240]   We want everybody to get involved in that.
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:28.680]   It's your share.
[00:19:28.680 --> 00:19:30.280]   All right.
[00:19:30.280 --> 00:19:31.120]   Let's talk tech.
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:33.560]   Speaking of things that are unaffordable, apples.
[00:19:34.200 --> 00:19:38.360]   I nine MacBook Pro tops out at $7,000.
[00:19:38.360 --> 00:19:41.240]   But to do that, you have to buy a four terabyte drive and so forth.
[00:19:41.240 --> 00:19:48.280]   And a lot of youtubers complained about performance that it was if you really tax the thing,
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:55.160]   the I nine would get so hot that it would perform worse than an I five while it was cooling off.
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:19:57.480]   Apple said, yeah, you know what?
[00:19:57.480 --> 00:19:59.480]   I'm glad you mentioned that.
[00:19:59.880 --> 00:20:03.600]   Turns out there was something wrong with it in the firmware.
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:06.600]   And on Monday, they released a supplemental update.
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:09.720]   They called, they said the bug was a missing digital key.
[00:20:09.720 --> 00:20:16.520]   I don't understand how this works at all, but a missing digital key that caused this problem.
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:21.960]   And in fact, everybody who then retested with the patch said, Oh, I love it.
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:22.960]   I found it.
[00:20:22.960 --> 00:20:25.680]   They they recreated the use the YouTube.
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:30.720]   Dave Tooty on YouTube. Yeah. And at first, they couldn't figure out what we don't understand.
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:31.400]   We haven't been able to.
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:32.560]   I was just working fine. Yeah.
[00:20:32.560 --> 00:20:34.400]   Dave Tooty did a few things weird.
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:35.960]   Like he put it in the freezer. Don't do that.
[00:20:35.960 --> 00:20:38.080]   Yeah. I was about to say that was my favorite part of the video.
[00:20:38.080 --> 00:20:40.000]   I just pulled it up here and I put it in the show notes.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:40.800]   It's good YouTube.
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:43.800]   He's like, look, I put it in the performance when you put it in the freezer.
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:46.360]   It's better. It goes twice as fast and rendering.
[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:49.680]   So they spent a while working with literally working with Dave Lee,
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:52.240]   because he's the first you two were pointing this out.
[00:20:52.600 --> 00:20:57.560]   And to and they duplicated it. And the scenario was he was using Adobe Premiere,
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:02.240]   not Apple's Final Cut, but Adobe Premiere to edit video to re
[00:21:02.240 --> 00:21:07.040]   compress a video and they were able to finally figure it out.
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:11.080]   And they said, Oh, yeah. Oh, looks.
[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:12.440]   It's it's the Oh, we forgot.
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:14.400]   There's a $9,000 laptop.
[00:21:14.400 --> 00:21:16.000]   We forgot to turn on the.
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.520]   But but on the other hand, it's pretty awesome that you could get a patch.
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:20.600]   And suddenly it's all.
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:24.120]   It's like Elon setting the OTA update to consumer reports.
[00:21:24.120 --> 00:21:25.440]   He's like, Oh, the brakes aren't working.
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:26.040]   Hold on a second.
[00:21:26.040 --> 00:21:26.800]   Wasn't that wild?
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:29.360]   The keyboard two weeks later, like consumer reports approves it.
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:35.000]   And we've never in our life seen somebody change the performance of a car with software.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.120]   Yeah, the breaking distance.
[00:21:36.120 --> 00:21:38.200]   They have it by over the year update.
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:40.680]   Hey, I can't help but notice you're wearing a Tesla jacket.
[00:21:40.680 --> 00:21:41.880]   I am wearing my OG.
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:43.280]   This is the Tesla jacket.
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:44.480]   They made a couple of hundred.
[00:21:44.480 --> 00:21:46.400]   Jason was a first in the Roadster Day.
[00:21:46.400 --> 00:21:49.680]   One of the first owners you had Roadster number one.
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:52.120]   Roadster 16 model S one.
[00:21:52.120 --> 00:21:53.080]   Model S number one.
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:21:54.080]   I have the surfboard.
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:58.000]   I don't have the surfboard, but I have model three number 100 of the
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:21:58.520]   founders.
[00:21:58.520 --> 00:21:59.680]   Oh, you have a model three now.
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:00.840]   I had you've had them all.
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:01.800]   I have all of them.
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:04.040]   I'm going to get the new right to point out.
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:05.880]   Oh, are you really?
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:06.200]   Yeah.
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.120]   That one's like hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[00:22:08.120 --> 00:22:09.200]   Yeah.
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:10.720]   Read the cover of the book.
[00:22:10.720 --> 00:22:12.560]   I did OK.
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:13.280]   I could do that.
[00:22:13.280 --> 00:22:14.000]   I stepped in.
[00:22:14.000 --> 00:22:15.600]   I stepped in three times.
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:18.480]   And I saw a model coming in.
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:19.080]   That's my wife.
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:20.440]   So I'm not getting the semi truck though.
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:21.880]   I told you you're not going to get the semi.
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:23.280]   I'll get the road.
[00:22:23.280 --> 00:22:24.160]   That's where you draw the line.
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:26.200]   So you know, Elon fairly well.
[00:22:26.200 --> 00:22:27.760]   What the hell's going on with Elon?
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:28.520]   He's upset.
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:33.000]   Yeah, I always got to be careful not to don't piss him off.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:34.160]   You won't get the new car.
[00:22:34.160 --> 00:22:37.080]   OK, I always don't want to be his spokesperson.
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:38.200]   No, you're not.
[00:22:38.200 --> 00:22:39.000]   Understand that.
[00:22:39.000 --> 00:22:41.880]   You know, personally, but I want to defend him because I
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:43.200]   respect what he's done.
[00:22:43.200 --> 00:22:43.920]   Yeah.
[00:22:43.920 --> 00:22:47.000]   But I don't respect him calling, for instance, the tie diver.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:49.920]   So that yeah, that was a huge mistake.
[00:22:49.920 --> 00:22:52.360]   He apologized and he needs to get off Twitter.
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:55.280]   And I think by the way, that's the rule for everyone.
[00:22:55.280 --> 00:22:58.800]   I just deleted off my phone and it's toxic and insane.
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:00.640]   It's toxic and you just have to get off of it.
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:04.360]   Like it literally is the worst place because you wind up.
[00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:06.240]   It makes you it's the rage video game.
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:09.000]   Yes, you open it up and you're like, what can I be outraged about?
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.600]   OK, that guy and he's no longer the underdog.
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:13.200]   Now he's like the billionaire guy.
[00:23:13.200 --> 00:23:15.000]   He wasn't a billionaire when he started on this.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:18.720]   In fact, he lost all his money at one point building Tesla up in space.
[00:23:18.720 --> 00:23:21.280]   That's when he went and he actually did go.
[00:23:21.280 --> 00:23:23.120]   Did he actually go to zero?
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:25.720]   He was negative living on a loan.
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:26.560]   I'm not talking to school.
[00:23:26.560 --> 00:23:27.640]   He'd talk about this.
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:31.280]   He was living off a $200,000 loan from another billionaire friend of ours.
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:34.920]   And he was just trying to figure out if he could during the great recession,
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:35.800]   which was only 10 years ago.
[00:23:35.800 --> 00:23:38.480]   So you're saying at some point I was doing better than Elon Musk.
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:39.520]   For sure.
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:41.760]   Unless you were millions of dollars in debt, you were.
[00:23:41.760 --> 00:23:43.280]   OK, holy cow.
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:44.640]   Everybody listening to the my voice.
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:49.400]   But now what happens is then you be society and they build you up and then they want to break you down.
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:51.760]   And that's by the way, the nature of the world.
[00:23:51.760 --> 00:23:56.400]   And there's no celebrity in America that isn't on top down.
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:59.120]   They want to as soon as you get any where they shoot at you.
[00:23:59.120 --> 00:23:59.960]   Fighting with everybody.
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:04.960]   Then the thing that nobody's ever seen is the short interest in Tesla's grown.
[00:24:04.960 --> 00:24:09.840]   And they're creating all these anonymous accounts just like they did during the election
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:11.440]   with the Russians and the bots.
[00:24:11.440 --> 00:24:14.240]   So these are people who are betting against Tesla success.
[00:24:14.240 --> 00:24:15.240]   They're betting this year.
[00:24:15.240 --> 00:24:15.920]   They're shorting your stock.
[00:24:15.920 --> 00:24:21.880]   So it's in their interest that the news about Tesla always be negative, always be bad.
[00:24:21.880 --> 00:24:23.960]   And they basically spread FUD, fear uncertainty doubt.
[00:24:23.960 --> 00:24:29.560]   And they ignore anything like people who buy the cars, not shutting up about them,
[00:24:29.560 --> 00:24:31.640]   the high ratings of them and all the achievements.
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:33.040]   And so I think he just got a little bit.
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:35.280]   There's also some ammo for some of these shorts.
[00:24:35.280 --> 00:24:40.560]   I mean, the ammo is they've been losing money like Amazon and other great companies
[00:24:40.560 --> 00:24:41.520]   for a long period of time.
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:43.960]   And the other ammo, which is totally valid.
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:48.560]   And Elon's like sleeping on the factory for fixing this is that he's been late with the cars.
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:52.560]   So when he was late with the other other cars, it was all super fans.
[00:24:52.560 --> 00:24:53.640]   So it didn't matter.
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:57.160]   Like if you were late with the models, hundreds of thousands of orders,
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:00.680]   then all of a sudden, now you got a populace of 500,000 people.
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:06.040]   It's not the 5,000 cozy people who were like rooting for this underdog to maybe even make the car.
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:08.000]   Who knows if it'll ever come out?
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:11.760]   Now we're beyond Kickstarter campaigning and now it's into the masses, but he'll figure it out.
[00:25:11.760 --> 00:25:13.160]   He always does.
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:22.280]   But yeah, I think that if you're going to bed, waking up, checking Twitter and involved in like a war with the shorts,
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:24.840]   it's just not healthy and you can't do it on the long term.
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:25.360]   He's stressed.
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:29.320]   So that pushed and I think anybody can understand that sometimes if, you know,
[00:25:29.320 --> 00:25:33.520]   in the truth is if it weren't for Twitter, no one would know his family and friends would know.
[00:25:33.520 --> 00:25:35.760]   Oh, poor Elon, he's really stressed out.
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:37.120]   He's kind of frisked.
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:39.800]   But but Twitter, suddenly everybody knows.
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:40.600]   Let's leave it at this.
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:42.520]   I'm not the only person who's deleted off his phone.
[00:25:42.520 --> 00:25:45.680]   Well, I also think this is other people who might not have it on their phone.
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:48.880]   I got an email from a close friend of Hollywood celebrity saying,
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:50.600]   "How did I delete all my tweets?"
[00:25:50.600 --> 00:25:54.600]   And you look at James Gunn, the director of Guardians of the Galaxy, old tweets.
[00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:55.600]   You just got barbecue, yeah.
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:25:57.280]   He lost his job.
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:01.440]   And Maggie from the New York Times who was probably like, "Man, he's like, "Enough of this.
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:02.200]   I can hear a woman.
[00:26:02.200 --> 00:26:03.560]   It's five times worse."
[00:26:03.560 --> 00:26:04.360]   And those were worse.
[00:26:04.360 --> 00:26:05.560]   It doesn't, it strikes me.
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:09.880]   I mean, obviously Twitter is accessible, but it strikes me this is the world we live in.
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:12.800]   We've got an internet troll as president.
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:14.320]   We've got trolls.
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:15.520]   The trolls have won.
[00:26:15.520 --> 00:26:16.320]   It's been mainstreamed.
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:18.000]   Well, I've written about this.
[00:26:18.000 --> 00:26:19.000]   I call it DAS.
[00:26:19.000 --> 00:26:20.360]   Disinformation as a service.
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:21.800]   There are companies that are emerging.
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:28.240]   And I think so, Elon's visibly stressed on Twitter in public.
[00:26:28.240 --> 00:26:32.960]   I think this is going to encourage a lot of, because that's a new goal for those who want to short the company.
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:34.120]   Yeah, just break down.
[00:26:34.120 --> 00:26:35.200]   Try to freak out the--
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:37.560]   I don't think Elon crazy, yes, or whoever the CEO is.
[00:26:37.560 --> 00:26:39.480]   It's like, when I get off of CNBC,
[00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:44.200]   if I say something nice about a company, I literally have 20 accounts.
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:47.040]   You look at my Twitter feed, I'll have 20 people reply.
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:48.520]   And they're like, "Oh, you fat bastard.
[00:26:48.520 --> 00:26:50.240]   Oh, blah, blah, blah."
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:53.840]   And they're literally doing psychops against me, trying to attack me personally.
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:55.160]   Some of those are real people.
[00:26:55.160 --> 00:26:56.560]   A lot of those are real people, though.
[00:26:56.560 --> 00:27:01.000]   No, but when I look at them, their account is got 50 tweets all in the last two weeks.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:01.840]   It's a blue egg.
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:02.360]   Yeah.
[00:27:02.360 --> 00:27:06.400]   And they're like, Tesla short or long Facebook, whatever.
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:07.720]   And it's on his--
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:07.720]   Yeah.
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:08.320]   What they're doing.
[00:27:08.320 --> 00:27:09.160]   So I got--
[00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:13.040]   Twitter deleted a bunch of accounts about a million accounts in the last quarter.
[00:27:13.040 --> 00:27:16.000]   I lost about 20,000, about 5%, 20,000 followers.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   I lost 5% of it.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:19.200]   Yeah, I'll tell you why.
[00:27:19.200 --> 00:27:20.720]   Well, OK.
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:27.600]   And there's stock price went down 19% because the stock market wants Twitter to grow
[00:27:27.600 --> 00:27:31.240]   at the normal rate of a Texas-Lica Valley tech company.
[00:27:31.240 --> 00:27:32.560]   Twitter has not been growing.
[00:27:32.560 --> 00:27:35.920]   And when you lose a million-- but these weren't real accounts.
[00:27:35.920 --> 00:27:38.000]   They're getting punished for doing the right thing.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   Yes.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   It's getting rid of them.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:41.640]   In fact, they didn't do enough of the right thing because I would say--
[00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:42.960]   Because they've done this the last 10 years.
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:46.920]   And I would say it's probably closer to a third to a half of Twitter accounts are bogus.
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:47.920]   Yeah.
[00:27:47.920 --> 00:27:50.280]   I mean, the service is being ruined by these accounts.
[00:27:50.280 --> 00:27:51.440]   So they took the medicine--
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:52.440]   But look what happened.
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:53.440]   They deleted a million.
[00:27:53.440 --> 00:27:54.440]   They lost 20%.
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:56.800]   What if they deleted the true number, which is more like 20, 30 million?
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:27:57.800]   Don't keep doing that over time.
[00:27:57.800 --> 00:27:58.800]   And then 50.
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:27:59.800]   People will adjust.
[00:27:59.800 --> 00:28:00.800]   But Facebook had the same thing.
[00:28:00.800 --> 00:28:03.960]   Their stock went down because they said they're going to increase spending and they're
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:05.800]   going to increase friction when you're buying ads.
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:07.960]   I think the stock market says nutty is Twitter.
[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:12.360]   Facebook lost more money than any company in the history of the stock market.
[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:14.360]   I think it was closer to $150 billion.
[00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:17.040]   It's a big number, but it's only 20%, 90%.
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:18.560]   It's not unprecedented on a percentage.
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:19.960]   And it wasn't because they're not growing.
[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:21.880]   It's because they're not growing at the right they were growing.
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:23.000]   It's really about the cost.
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:25.520]   So the CFO said the costs are going to--
[00:28:25.520 --> 00:28:26.680]   Well, of course.
[00:28:26.680 --> 00:28:31.480]   The growth in costs will be higher than the growth in revenue because we're not going
[00:28:31.480 --> 00:28:32.480]   to focus on revenue growth.
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:34.560]   We're going to focus on cleaning up the service.
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:38.720]   So in both cases, the companies are being penalized for doing the right thing.
[00:28:38.720 --> 00:28:41.800]   Which makes sense in a way because if you don't do the right thing and you let it just
[00:28:41.800 --> 00:28:48.880]   go crazy, yeah, you sell ads to the Russians in rubles and bad things happen.
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:54.640]   You kind of just let advertisers run them back and you have Cambridge Analytica.
[00:28:54.640 --> 00:28:56.640]   And you have all these weird things.
[00:28:56.640 --> 00:29:00.200]   If you tighten it up, you'll have no Cambridge Analytica, but also other advertisers will
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:01.720]   get stopped in the process.
[00:29:01.720 --> 00:29:06.480]   Although, when I look at Facebook's revenue, 91% now mobile, that looks like that's going
[00:29:06.480 --> 00:29:07.480]   in the right direction.
[00:29:07.480 --> 00:29:09.360]   If they solve that problem, yeah.
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:11.360]   So why did you do this?
[00:29:11.360 --> 00:29:14.000]   Well, I managed my followership--
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:15.960]   You can't delete a follower.
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:17.840]   You can't say you can't follow me.
[00:29:17.840 --> 00:29:18.840]   You can block people.
[00:29:18.840 --> 00:29:19.840]   You just block them.
[00:29:19.840 --> 00:29:20.840]   I just block them.
[00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:25.560]   But anyway, I've been managing this for years.
[00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:29.960]   Just anybody who seems even remotely trollish, I sort of block them and then they wander
[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:31.680]   away eventually.
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:37.240]   I think Twitter, I think the media deserves huge blame for the pain they're getting because
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:38.920]   Twitter tweets like they're--
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:39.920]   No, no.
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:40.920]   But that's not what I mean.
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:45.360]   What I mean is this thing is being reported as that they purged users and people lost
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:46.360]   users.
[00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:47.360]   You didn't lose any users.
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:51.400]   If a publishing company has been saying they have a million subscribers and then they
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:52.400]   come out and say, you know what?
[00:29:52.400 --> 00:29:54.400]   We only have 900,000 subscribers.
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:56.680]   They didn't lose 100,000 subscribers.
[00:29:56.680 --> 00:29:58.240]   They are now reporting things.
[00:29:58.240 --> 00:30:00.680]   Things are more honest.
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:02.600]   When you delete a bot, you don't delete a user.
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:03.840]   You delete a non-user.
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:08.200]   I would say though, if we're going to be honest, they should delete about 100 million users
[00:30:08.200 --> 00:30:09.760]   because about 100 million people are saying--
[00:30:09.760 --> 00:30:10.920]   They should even call them users.
[00:30:10.920 --> 00:30:12.840]   They should call them fraudulent accounts.
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:13.840]   There you go.
[00:30:13.840 --> 00:30:16.840]   We deleted 100 million fraudulent accounts.
[00:30:16.840 --> 00:30:19.040]   All that matters is the daily active users.
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:23.640]   And as in relation to monthly active users, Twitter has never released daily active users
[00:30:23.640 --> 00:30:26.680]   because it's so low compared to Facebook.
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:29.640]   So they've only said it's much lower than monthly.
[00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:33.080]   So monthly is 325 million or something in that range.
[00:30:33.080 --> 00:30:37.280]   So if they are saying much lower, I think it's probably between 50 and 75 million daily
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:38.720]   active users.
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:39.720]   It's still an amazing success.
[00:30:39.720 --> 00:30:41.760]   They're still going to make a couple of billion dollars a year.
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:46.000]   But they're in the Yahoo Google trap, which is they're constantly compared to Facebook
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.080]   and they're fundamentally different services for different groups of people.
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:51.360]   And they should not put themselves in that comparison game.
[00:30:51.360 --> 00:30:53.160]   But it's healthy what they're doing.
[00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:57.520]   Because they're going to start losing, you know, let's say Elon doesn't have it on his
[00:30:57.520 --> 00:30:59.280]   phone and Maggie from the New York Times doesn't.
[00:30:59.280 --> 00:31:00.280]   I don't.
[00:31:00.280 --> 00:31:01.280]   I'm not putting myself in their categories.
[00:31:01.280 --> 00:31:05.280]   But it's becoming a trend that your life becomes better when you remove the service.
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:07.440]   That is a dangerous signal for Twitter.
[00:31:07.440 --> 00:31:12.960]   And Twitter is so important, so culturally relevant, far more so than Facebook.
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:14.720]   I think they really need to take action.
[00:31:14.720 --> 00:31:17.120]   And the action is actually very, very simple.
[00:31:17.120 --> 00:31:22.160]   And we talked about this before on Twig and other shows, Leo, but I believe strongly that
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:26.680]   Twitter should do exactly what Facebook does and Google+ does, which is that when somebody
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:31.240]   comments on something you posted, you can delete their comment.
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:33.280]   Instagram does that.
[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:34.440]   Everybody does it except Twitter.
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:39.680]   So what you can do, what that enables is Maggie Haberman can start a conversation and
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:41.360]   then she can moderate her own conversation.
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:44.160]   I actually have a better, even better punch up to that, which is what they should do
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:51.200]   is when you post, it should say, allow replies from your followers, people you follow or
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:52.200]   both.
[00:31:52.200 --> 00:31:53.200]   So you can actually narrow it.
[00:31:53.200 --> 00:31:54.200]   Forget about deleting it.
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:56.640]   I could just say, don't leave my followers are allowed to.
[00:31:56.640 --> 00:32:00.280]   Post, then if you follow me and you write a trolling, I just block you.
[00:32:00.280 --> 00:32:01.280]   And you're gone.
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:02.280]   And now you're gone forever.
[00:32:02.280 --> 00:32:03.280]   And so...
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:04.280]   Would that be a...
[00:32:04.280 --> 00:32:05.280]   That would be great.
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:06.600]   I gave him another suggestion, which actually he took.
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:10.960]   I wrote a blog post saying whenever somebody posts something really abhorrent and it's been
[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:16.760]   signaled, why don't you blur it out and say potentially nefarious content or potentially
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:20.840]   offensive content and then click to see it and you can click to unlock it.
[00:32:20.840 --> 00:32:22.480]   And they did that actually feature.
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:24.400]   So they are listening and they're trying.
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:28.880]   But you got to remember, they started with this whole original free speech concept.
[00:32:28.880 --> 00:32:32.840]   And now they're starting to realize free speech at scale with anonymous accounts does
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:33.840]   not work.
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:34.840]   Right.
[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:36.880]   It just doesn't work.
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:40.880]   Unless you can just have your own world, live in your own world.
[00:32:40.880 --> 00:32:43.280]   So this is one of the things that...
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:44.280]   Private social networks.
[00:32:44.280 --> 00:32:48.880]   So somebody in the chat room mentioned Google+, I am on record for being a huge Google+ fanboy.
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:51.760]   I don't think it's anywhere near as good as it used to be.
[00:32:51.760 --> 00:32:54.960]   But still, they have a feature now on Google+, it's fantastic.
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:58.480]   With one click of a button you can report, delete and block.
[00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:02.480]   And then another thing pops up and you can get rid of all their other recent comments.
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:04.760]   So it's just so powerful, it's just clean house.
[00:33:04.760 --> 00:33:08.880]   But the whole way that you use something like Google+, or maybe even Facebook, is you're
[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:10.760]   not on Facebook.
[00:33:10.760 --> 00:33:14.560]   You're not on Google+, you're on your own little world.
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:16.960]   And that's how a social network should be.
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:21.320]   You should be isolated in your own little world where it's like a cocktail party.
[00:33:21.320 --> 00:33:24.000]   You don't invite anyone to your house for a cocktail party.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   You're specific about it.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   And somebody knocks over the lamp and gets drunk.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   We're two factor authentication.
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:31.300]   I mean, when people had to put their phone numbers in, the number of spam accounts went
[00:33:31.300 --> 00:33:32.300]   down dramatically.
[00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:37.640]   So now, if you try to sign up for a lot of services, they want you to use...
[00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:41.640]   They'll block you if you're on a VPN, they'll block you if you're using burner numbers,
[00:33:41.640 --> 00:33:44.040]   they'll block you...
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:47.960]   All these kind of techniques are starting to be installed.
[00:33:47.960 --> 00:33:52.280]   But the reason they weren't installed initially was because they would affect user numbers.
[00:33:52.280 --> 00:33:53.560]   Yeah, what would that do to them?
[00:33:53.560 --> 00:33:55.080]   That would decimate their numbers.
[00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:57.680]   I mean, could Twitter be a private company?
[00:33:57.680 --> 00:33:59.680]   Could they pull a Dell?
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:01.680]   I think it's ideal for...
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:06.040]   It would be better if it was part of a media company like Disney was the one...
[00:34:06.040 --> 00:34:07.520]   If it was part of Disney...
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:09.320]   Disney's never going to do that.
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:10.320]   No, no.
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:12.840]   Well, they have ESPN and they have ABC News, right?
[00:34:12.840 --> 00:34:13.840]   So they have ABC and ESPN.
[00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:16.920]   But no media company wants to own something they can't control.
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:20.520]   Yeah, and they can slowly put controls into it and make it a little bit more Disney-like.
[00:34:20.520 --> 00:34:22.600]   And then no one would use it.
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:25.960]   No, I think people would still use it, actually, because the celebrities are there.
[00:34:25.960 --> 00:34:29.320]   Facebook has never been able to get celebrities to use their platform.
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:30.800]   Twitter is the native celebrity.
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:33.320]   Is that why people use Twitter because celebrities are there?
[00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:34.720]   I think it's a big part of it.
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:39.600]   It's celebrities, notable people like journalists, musicians, kind of like it.
[00:34:39.600 --> 00:34:43.880]   CEOs, founders, journalists, like all those people who are verified...
[00:34:43.880 --> 00:34:48.280]   Is there not an underlying, deeper problem that people are sick of the...
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:51.640]   So all of social media, there's a certain...
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:53.560]   I feel like...
[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:54.560]   Maybe this just...
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:55.560]   Maybe this is me.
[00:34:55.560 --> 00:34:58.000]   I feel like people are tired of being always connected.
[00:34:58.000 --> 00:34:59.600]   I just want to go back to the village.
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:04.200]   I think they believe that they are tired of social media, but I think fundamentally social
[00:35:04.200 --> 00:35:09.720]   media is far more valuable than almost anybody gives it credit for.
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:12.720]   I mean, the ability to connect with somebody.
[00:35:12.720 --> 00:35:14.960]   For example, we were talking about these experiences we do.
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:17.200]   We become really good friends in one week, right?
[00:35:17.200 --> 00:35:20.720]   And then we stay connected on social media forever.
[00:35:20.720 --> 00:35:23.080]   And Facebook or Twitter?
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:26.120]   Instagram, mostly, and Facebook a little bit, wherever people are.
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:27.600]   I'm on all of them.
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:32.840]   But social media is fantastically valuable, fundamentally.
[00:35:32.840 --> 00:35:39.760]   And I really think that users don't spend enough time demanding that you, the company,
[00:35:39.760 --> 00:35:44.600]   you Facebook, you Twitter, give us the users control over our own stuff.
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:47.320]   They always want to control it because that's where the money is.
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.320]   That's where the users are.
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:50.360]   That's where they want to have algorithms you can never...
[00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:55.040]   I want a social network where I follow people and I get what they post.
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:56.040]   That's what I want.
[00:35:56.040 --> 00:35:57.680]   And that doesn't exist.
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:58.680]   Think about that.
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:35:59.680]   That does not exist.
[00:35:59.680 --> 00:36:01.320]   You can't be an RSS reader with blogs.
[00:36:01.320 --> 00:36:02.320]   Yeah.
[00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:06.240]   And then they had RSS was supported by Twitter and then I think they deprecated the RSS
[00:36:06.240 --> 00:36:07.480]   where they really did replace it.
[00:36:07.480 --> 00:36:08.480]   They killed RSS.
[00:36:08.480 --> 00:36:09.480]   They killed blogs.
[00:36:09.480 --> 00:36:10.960]   They killed it all.
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:11.960]   Let's take a break.
[00:36:11.960 --> 00:36:12.960]   Jason Calicanis is here.
[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:15.840]   We've, you know, I think we did one story.
[00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:16.840]   We got a lot more to do.
[00:36:16.840 --> 00:36:19.200]   Jason Calicanis is here, Mike Kelligan.
[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:20.880]   I knew it would be like this.
[00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:22.640]   That's why it's the three of us.
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:26.200]   And I'm, and I think it was a smart move.
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:28.600]   We're going to talk a little bit about one of our sponsors right now.
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:36.880]   I, the other day, I made Chrissy Teagans, Chipotle Lime Chicken Fajitas with Satay Mushrooms
[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:37.880]   and Sweet Peppers.
[00:36:37.880 --> 00:36:38.880]   You like it.
[00:36:38.880 --> 00:36:39.880]   She loved it.
[00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:46.760]   Blue Apron is so, you know, it's funny because just the other day, Lisa said, we're always,
[00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:49.360]   for the rest of our life, we're going to have blue apron.
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:54.000]   We don't, not every meal is blue apron, but we do, I think we do three a week.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:59.480]   Often we give one away, but the idea is that they deliver to you all the ingredients.
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:04.360]   Beautiful, by the way, the meat, the vegetables, everything's perfect.
[00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:08.200]   Pretty proportioned exactly right with the recipes and pictures and everything step by
[00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:11.720]   step to make something amazing.
[00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:13.600]   You can get the family plan, which is four.
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:14.960]   You can get the couple plan.
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:16.680]   And now, which is nice, you can mix and match.
[00:37:16.680 --> 00:37:20.240]   So you can get one meal as a family meal, one meal as just the two of you.
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:22.600]   And it, no meal planning, no shopping.
[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:23.880]   You go straight to cooking.
[00:37:23.880 --> 00:37:26.520]   It's about half an hour, 45 minutes to cook.
[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:27.960]   The house smells fabulous.
[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:30.280]   You feel a real sense of accomplishment.
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:34.040]   And there is this kind of feeling of I'm doing something for people I love.
[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:36.920]   I'm making a meal that they're going to love.
[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:39.320]   And it's incredible.
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:41.040]   We have been so happy with blue apron.
[00:37:41.040 --> 00:37:50.000]   Our 15 year old who is very picky, the other day I made a steak with caper butter sauce.
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:51.840]   And it was so incredible.
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:53.560]   What was the side on that?
[00:37:53.560 --> 00:37:54.560]   It was something unusual.
[00:37:54.560 --> 00:37:55.560]   It was really phenomenal.
[00:37:55.560 --> 00:37:57.480]   Yeah, capers are great, right?
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:37:59.160]   This caper butter thing was so good.
[00:37:59.160 --> 00:38:04.000]   Oh, is that mashed potatoes with, I wish I could remember the right.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:05.800]   Anyway, it was fabulous.
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:08.320]   And then, and then just, and then I know how to do it.
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:09.320]   And so I can do it again.
[00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:12.960]   I keep those cards, but honestly, it just broadens your range.
[00:38:12.960 --> 00:38:14.720]   It gives you delicious food.
[00:38:14.720 --> 00:38:18.840]   They have 12 new recipes a week and you can choose two, three or four recipes, depending
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:19.840]   on your schedule.
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:22.720]   Of course, you could put off a week's delivery anytime.
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:24.160]   That's not a problem.
[00:38:24.160 --> 00:38:29.400]   Non-GMO ingredients meet with no added hormones, delicious stuff.
[00:38:29.400 --> 00:38:30.760]   One customer favorite.
[00:38:30.760 --> 00:38:34.680]   I want to do this one, sweet chili beef and vegetable stir fry.
[00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:35.680]   They have vegetarian too.
[00:38:35.680 --> 00:38:39.080]   How about barbecue vegetable flatbread with Swiss cheese?
[00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:41.520]   Just phenomenal stuff.
[00:38:41.520 --> 00:38:43.000]   Check it out this week.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.080]   You go there, look at the menu, pick three meals.
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:48.560]   You'll get them free with free shipping at blueapron.com/twit.
[00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:55.320]   Your first three meals free with free shipping, blueapron.com/twit.
[00:38:55.320 --> 00:38:58.120]   I couldn't be happier with blueapron.
[00:38:58.120 --> 00:39:04.320]   You know, the stat that I've heard I think is that Americans throw away approximately
[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:05.920]   half the food that they buy.
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:06.920]   Yeah, well, we don't ever do that.
[00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:09.760]   Blueapron, you've got the right amount.
[00:39:09.760 --> 00:39:11.760]   Because it's exactly the right amount.
[00:39:11.760 --> 00:39:16.800]   Yeah, they're fantastic.
[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:20.560]   I did want to mention, as long as we're in Apple, Gary Vaynerchuk.
[00:39:20.560 --> 00:39:21.560]   I don't know.
[00:39:21.560 --> 00:39:22.560]   Are you and Gary friends?
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:23.560]   I know, Gary.
[00:39:23.560 --> 00:39:24.560]   I like the Gary.
[00:39:24.560 --> 00:39:25.560]   Yeah, we're friendly.
[00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:26.560]   He's a friend.
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:27.560]   He's a friend.
[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:29.560]   The New York City area.
[00:39:29.560 --> 00:39:30.560]   Yep.
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:32.840]   He's like a motivational speaker now.
[00:39:32.840 --> 00:39:34.200]   He's becoming Tony Robbins.
[00:39:34.200 --> 00:39:35.200]   Yes.
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:36.200]   Which I think turns...
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:37.200]   Of marketing, though.
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:38.200]   Tony Robbins.
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:40.560]   No, I think he's kind of going full Tony Robbins, like hugging people.
[00:39:40.560 --> 00:39:42.720]   I saw like a couple of people crying in his arms.
[00:39:42.720 --> 00:39:43.720]   Oh my God.
[00:39:43.720 --> 00:39:44.720]   He's like walking over coals.
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:45.720]   Full.
[00:39:45.720 --> 00:39:46.720]   He's gone full.
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:47.720]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:48.720]   Motivational speaker, which is fun.
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:49.960]   But I think that's true to some people.
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:50.960]   He's good at it.
[00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:51.960]   We love Gary.
[00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:53.320]   I've known for forever, probably 10 years at least.
[00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:54.320]   Yeah.
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:56.840]   When you swear in our chat room, it says Vaynerchuk instead of the swear word.
[00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:59.400]   So he's always memorializing a chat room.
[00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:00.400]   He was on that.
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:02.360]   Okay, everybody save the effort in the chat room, please.
[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:03.360]   Thank you.
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:04.360]   Oh, sorry.
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:05.360]   Don't do that.
[00:40:05.360 --> 00:40:06.360]   Sorry.
[00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:07.360]   Oh, go ahead.
[00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:09.600]   Actually, if everybody says Vaynerchuk, it'll even be funnier.
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:12.120]   So he was in that Planet of the Apps show.
[00:40:12.120 --> 00:40:13.120]   The worst thing ever.
[00:40:13.120 --> 00:40:14.120]   Yeah.
[00:40:14.120 --> 00:40:15.120]   Just a piece of junk.
[00:40:15.120 --> 00:40:16.120]   I passed.
[00:40:16.120 --> 00:40:17.120]   Did you, they asked you to be on it?
[00:40:17.120 --> 00:40:18.120]   Yeah.
[00:40:18.120 --> 00:40:19.120]   You were smart.
[00:40:19.120 --> 00:40:20.120]   Good call.
[00:40:20.120 --> 00:40:21.960]   I just knew like it was a shiny floor show.
[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:22.960]   Yeah.
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:25.120]   And it was such a knockoff and had no original ideas.
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:26.120]   Yeah.
[00:40:26.120 --> 00:40:30.360]   It's going to be like you and Gwen the Paltro.
[00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:31.360]   Yeah.
[00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:32.360]   Jessica Alba.
[00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:33.360]   I was like, wait a minute.
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:35.120]   Is this, I was like, these aren't internet people.
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:36.760]   And they're like, well, she's got goop.
[00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:38.520]   I'm like, she's got a blog like to show it.
[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:39.720]   Why don't you just have like.
[00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:42.160]   And then the idea is you come down and elevate it.
[00:40:42.160 --> 00:40:44.360]   Instead of the elevator pitch and escalator pitch.
[00:40:44.360 --> 00:40:45.360]   So you're on the escalator.
[00:40:45.360 --> 00:40:47.400]   Like far, literally terrible.
[00:40:47.400 --> 00:40:50.440]   And you have, so you have whatever time 30 seconds to pitch them.
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:53.360]   And then it's kind of shark tank meets.
[00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:54.360]   It was terrible.
[00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:55.360]   It was just a knockoff of shark tank.
[00:40:55.360 --> 00:40:56.360]   Yeah.
[00:40:56.360 --> 00:41:00.080]   Gary says that it wasn't a bad show.
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:01.600]   He says it was badly marketed.
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:03.520]   They should have hired me.
[00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:08.200]   What does Apple know about marketing?
[00:41:08.200 --> 00:41:10.480]   He says he stayed quiet during the marketing meetings.
[00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:13.040]   Let Apple handle it.
[00:41:13.040 --> 00:41:16.440]   Gary, just, you know, it was a bad show.
[00:41:16.440 --> 00:41:18.160]   It's okay to say it was a bad show.
[00:41:18.160 --> 00:41:19.160]   Yeah.
[00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:21.560]   Also, like you don't want to throw mud at your former partner.
[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:22.560]   So just.
[00:41:22.560 --> 00:41:23.560]   Right.
[00:41:23.560 --> 00:41:24.560]   That was not.
[00:41:24.560 --> 00:41:26.320]   I'm not highlighting it, but it's fine.
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:28.520]   You know, you have to never get high on your own supply.
[00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:31.920]   And I think that's one of the 10 rules with 10 correct commandments.
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:32.920]   Absolutely.
[00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:33.920]   Yeah.
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:37.320]   We got hired to Scarface, but never get high on your own supply.
[00:41:37.320 --> 00:41:39.560]   But he's got a little scarface at that.
[00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:40.560]   Yeah.
[00:41:40.560 --> 00:41:41.560]   He's got a little high on his own supply there.
[00:41:41.560 --> 00:41:46.560]   Like, yeah, the show would have been a hit if only I had done the marketing and pin those.
[00:41:46.560 --> 00:41:48.720]   The he's got it exactly backwards.
[00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:51.160]   Apple, nobody's as good at marketing as Apple.
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:52.760]   Nobody's as bad at context.
[00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:53.760]   Exactly.
[00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:54.760]   That was insane.
[00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:55.760]   That's insane.
[00:41:55.760 --> 00:42:00.160]   And I think to a very large extent, maybe I stole this idea from one of your shows, Leo.
[00:42:00.160 --> 00:42:02.960]   I heard it somewhere.
[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:06.920]   Apple probably didn't market it a lot because they knew it sucked.
[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:09.000]   That was definitely what it was.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   Here's the thing.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   They hired an outside company.
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:12.640]   They learned their lesson.
[00:42:12.640 --> 00:42:14.720]   Yeah, I forgot the guy's name, but it will come to me in a minute.
[00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:20.160]   But anyway, it was a guy who brought the office to America, like really smart cat.
[00:42:20.160 --> 00:42:23.600]   And then I think he kind of just did this like threw it together because when they talked
[00:42:23.600 --> 00:42:25.760]   to me, it was kind of like very rushed.
[00:42:25.760 --> 00:42:29.000]   And it seemed like they were taping in a couple of months and it was just being all thrown
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   together.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.240]   And they didn't know what they were doing.
[00:42:31.240 --> 00:42:32.520]   They really didn't do a lot of research.
[00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:34.120]   And so I think that's exactly what it was.
[00:42:34.120 --> 00:42:38.360]   Apple was so embarrassed by it, but they had to put it out that it was like, let's just
[00:42:38.360 --> 00:42:40.160]   not market it.
[00:42:40.160 --> 00:42:44.920]   But it does show how hard it is, what Netflix does, Hulu does.
[00:42:44.920 --> 00:42:46.560]   Making hit shows is hard.
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:48.160]   It's also unpredictable.
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:50.440]   You can't predict what is going to be a hot show.
[00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:52.560]   Well, but you can make a good show no matter what.
[00:42:52.560 --> 00:42:56.160]   You can't predict it'll be a success, but you don't have to make a bad show.
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:58.320]   I'm not sure.
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:04.760]   I think with Apple, because they have their DNA is to only put something out if it's perfect.
[00:43:04.760 --> 00:43:08.280]   The watch was kind of like the only exception I can think of where they maybe rushed that
[00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:12.160]   product a little too much because Wall Street was pushing them hard on a new product category
[00:43:12.160 --> 00:43:13.160]   and look what happened there.
[00:43:13.160 --> 00:43:16.840]   But they're so reserved in what they put out there.
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:20.920]   They have a small number of views, very small number of items.
[00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:22.520]   It's the opposite of what Netflix does.
[00:43:22.520 --> 00:43:23.520]   Netflix is like, what's your idea?
[00:43:23.520 --> 00:43:24.520]   Go for it.
[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:25.520]   We'll buy two seasons.
[00:43:25.520 --> 00:43:26.520]   What's your idea?
[00:43:26.520 --> 00:43:27.520]   We'll buy three seasons.
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:28.520]   Just go for it.
[00:43:28.520 --> 00:43:29.520]   Show us.
[00:43:29.520 --> 00:43:30.520]   No, we won't pilot it.
[00:43:30.520 --> 00:43:31.520]   No, we don't do pilots.
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:32.520]   We'll just buy the whole season.
[00:43:32.520 --> 00:43:33.520]   Amazon is doing that kind of too.
[00:43:33.520 --> 00:43:37.320]   And actually apparently Time Warner wants to do that with HBO now, which really concerns
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:38.320]   me.
[00:43:38.320 --> 00:43:39.320]   They want them to go 10x.
[00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:42.200]   It is a problem though on Netflix that there's too much new content.
[00:43:42.200 --> 00:43:43.200]   I don't.
[00:43:43.200 --> 00:43:45.160]   They're going through a bad spell.
[00:43:45.160 --> 00:43:46.480]   There's nothing good on there.
[00:43:46.480 --> 00:43:47.480]   I don't know.
[00:43:47.480 --> 00:43:48.720]   I've been really disappointed in this election.
[00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:50.600]   That's kind of pretty problematic for them.
[00:43:50.600 --> 00:43:54.960]   I mean, in fact, I think that they, didn't they, their results came out a couple of weeks
[00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:56.920]   ago and I think that they were just a bit of a disappointment.
[00:43:56.920 --> 00:43:57.920]   Oh yeah.
[00:43:57.920 --> 00:43:59.960]   They had a, they had, I think it's going to be one of these things with them where the
[00:43:59.960 --> 00:44:03.720]   subscriber base will parallel the hit shows when they have an orange is the new black
[00:44:03.720 --> 00:44:04.720]   or they have daredevilness.
[00:44:04.720 --> 00:44:11.640]   There's a lot of promise there or, you know, some big comedian does a couple of specials.
[00:44:11.640 --> 00:44:13.640]   People will go there, but they had a very meager quarter.
[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:15.080]   They didn't really grow that much.
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:18.240]   And before the quarter, before that, two quarters, before that, they grew like five million.
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:20.040]   So it really is hit based.
[00:44:20.040 --> 00:44:22.640]   It's a lot like the venture business, right?
[00:44:22.640 --> 00:44:25.800]   It's like it's, you know, you have lots and lots of failures and then you have one super
[00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:27.440]   hit and that just pays for everything.
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:28.960]   And that by the way, that's all that people remember.
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:30.680]   You're defined by their hits.
[00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:32.000]   So you know, you have half the cards.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   You're good.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   You're orange is new black.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:35.000]   You're good.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   Yep.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   They're going to remember the Adam Sandler movies.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   Like he did eight movies in the last 12 months.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   Yeah.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   I don't think anybody remembers any of them.
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   That's right.
[00:44:42.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   It's interesting.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.800]   Apple has decided that they want to succeed instead.
[00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:47.520]   So they've hired two executives from Sony.
[00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:49.200]   They seem to be hiring a lot of big names.
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:50.920]   They're spending a billion dollars.
[00:44:50.920 --> 00:44:52.920]   That's that's shad dwarfed by what?
[00:44:52.920 --> 00:44:53.920]   Exactly.
[00:44:53.920 --> 00:44:55.640]   That's not a lot of money in this right now.
[00:44:55.640 --> 00:44:57.920]   It's a pretty good start, I would say.
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:44:59.360]   They need to come up with their own.
[00:44:59.360 --> 00:45:04.160]   I believe Apple needs Apple Prime, like their own version of one subscription.
[00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:05.760]   That's the question.
[00:45:05.760 --> 00:45:07.600]   Where are these shows going to show up?
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:09.080]   What does Apple in our Apple music?
[00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:10.080]   Well, that makes no sense.
[00:45:10.080 --> 00:45:11.680]   There's a drop down somewhere in iTunes.
[00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:12.680]   Yeah.
[00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:13.680]   Yeah.
[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:14.680]   It's just they're so that I do.
[00:45:14.680 --> 00:45:16.920]   Where did carpal karaoke and the planet of the apps show up?
[00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:18.520]   No, you had to add them somehow.
[00:45:18.520 --> 00:45:19.800]   They specifically buried them.
[00:45:19.800 --> 00:45:22.640]   What they need to do is like.
[00:45:22.640 --> 00:45:24.520]   They need what one subscription to rule them all?
[00:45:24.520 --> 00:45:25.520]   One subscription to rule them all.
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:27.160]   So for 20 bucks, this is my idea.
[00:45:27.160 --> 00:45:32.400]   20 bucks gets you music, their TV shows, Apple Care and One Terabyte.
[00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:33.840]   Nobody's going to use the One Terabyte obviously.
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:35.320]   That's a very good idea.
[00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:36.800]   And then I just pay you one that's--
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:38.320]   Amazon Prime is really--
[00:45:38.320 --> 00:45:39.320]   Right.
[00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:43.040]   And then what they can do is they can increase it from 15 to 20 to 25 over time.
[00:45:43.040 --> 00:45:46.280]   And they can include like you get one iPhone replaced every two years.
[00:45:46.280 --> 00:45:48.480]   Like you'd be like some meager Apple Care.
[00:45:48.480 --> 00:45:51.240]   It doesn't have to be like crazy Apple Care.
[00:45:51.240 --> 00:45:54.720]   But that would just make it easy because right now you're having this confusion with
[00:45:54.720 --> 00:45:55.960]   where do you find everything?
[00:45:55.960 --> 00:45:56.960]   Right.
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:57.960]   You know, it's just too many things to buy.
[00:45:57.960 --> 00:46:03.240]   There was a rumor that Apple is going to do exactly what you just said.
[00:46:03.240 --> 00:46:04.240]   Yeah.
[00:46:04.240 --> 00:46:05.760]   Though that may be--
[00:46:05.760 --> 00:46:06.760]   It's just a--
[00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:10.160]   They'll be tears so that you don't have to buy it all that you can just--
[00:46:10.160 --> 00:46:11.160]   Too much cheer in your choice.
[00:46:11.160 --> 00:46:12.160]   Yeah, that's not good.
[00:46:12.160 --> 00:46:14.160]   You probably should just buy it all, right?
[00:46:14.160 --> 00:46:15.440]   The promise they have to give a license.
[00:46:15.440 --> 00:46:18.760]   They have to give a fee for Apple every time they give one of those.
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:19.760]   So that's sort of the rub.
[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:23.080]   It's-- Apple has to give the music industry a portion of it every month.
[00:46:23.080 --> 00:46:25.080]   But it would just make it so much easier for them to just--
[00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:29.800]   Neil Seibert, who's an Apple analyst, did in fact say $20 a month bundle of music video
[00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:30.800]   and paid magazines.
[00:46:30.800 --> 00:46:33.520]   I said that's like 18 months ago I said this.
[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:34.520]   Yeah.
[00:46:34.520 --> 00:46:37.040]   But I like the idea of throwing in a little storage.
[00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:39.600]   Although Apple makes a lot of money on these things.
[00:46:39.600 --> 00:46:42.640]   If they're making their big money on subscription-based services--
[00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:43.640]   And apps.
[00:46:43.640 --> 00:46:46.200]   That's the big underground story is--
[00:46:46.200 --> 00:46:47.840]   Subscription-based services.
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:51.960]   Yeah, so people are subscribing to Netflix or I'm an investor in a company called com.com.
[00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:52.960]   Through them.
[00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:53.320]   Through the actual--
[00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:54.520]   And they get a third of that, right?
[00:46:54.520 --> 00:46:55.360]   They get 30%.
[00:46:55.360 --> 00:46:56.880]   Well, it varies.
[00:46:56.880 --> 00:46:59.080]   They'll lower the subscription fees a little bit.
[00:46:59.080 --> 00:46:59.640]   I don't think so.
[00:46:59.640 --> 00:47:00.080]   I think it's still there.
[00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:01.640]   You have a year worth of subscribers.
[00:47:01.640 --> 00:47:02.960]   I think it goes down to 15%.
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:04.920]   Yeah, maybe by year.
[00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:09.240]   But com.com pays them a large amount of money, but com.com gets a lot of more of them.
[00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:12.160]   So I told everybody, like, if you were going to sell your DVDs in a store,
[00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:14.920]   you would sell them to Walmart for $0.50 on the dollar.
[00:47:14.920 --> 00:47:16.560]   This is a better deal.
[00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:21.440]   And this is the future of Apple, is this services revenue on top of the--
[00:47:21.440 --> 00:47:24.800]   9.4 billion last quarter, I think, something like that.
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:28.680]   It actually was bigger than an iPad and Mac revenue combined.
[00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:29.240]   Yeah.
[00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:30.840]   It'll be iPhone and App Store business.
[00:47:30.840 --> 00:47:34.400]   I mean, you think about it, the unbundling of cable, the average cable building in the
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:35.760]   United States is $140.
[00:47:35.760 --> 00:47:36.520]   People don't realize that.
[00:47:36.520 --> 00:47:38.640]   So that means some people are paying $250.
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:39.360]   It's like embarrassing.
[00:47:39.360 --> 00:47:42.360]   I'm paying $3,000 to direct TV for every channel.
[00:47:42.360 --> 00:47:44.920]   And you're like, oh, it's only $250 a month.
[00:47:44.920 --> 00:47:47.760]   It's $30,000 every 10 years.
[00:47:47.760 --> 00:47:50.760]   You save it on gasoline, though, because that's the goodness.
[00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:55.320]   But anyway, the way they-- what's going to happen is, as everybody unbundles from that,
[00:47:55.320 --> 00:47:59.720]   then they buy the skinny bundle from DirectTV, which I have DirectTV now, which is amazing.
[00:47:59.720 --> 00:48:00.600]   Isn't that what Apple's doing?
[00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:03.600]   Now, if you look at the Apple TV, they have that central TV app.
[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:05.440]   That's the default home page.
[00:48:05.440 --> 00:48:07.200]   All of the services are in there.
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:10.080]   You can encourage you to buy those through Apple, by the way.
[00:48:10.080 --> 00:48:12.800]   And that's where they put other stuff.
[00:48:12.800 --> 00:48:16.280]   And really, in effect, they're becoming your cable provider all over the top.
[00:48:16.280 --> 00:48:17.600]   You can buy it from anywhere you want.
[00:48:17.600 --> 00:48:18.600]   But all over the top.
[00:48:18.600 --> 00:48:23.120]   If you buy HBO directly from their website, or I buy the NBA League Pass directly from
[00:48:23.120 --> 00:48:25.960]   the NBA, I can log in on Apple TV now.
[00:48:25.960 --> 00:48:30.000]   So it makes it like you feel more in control with the 7/8 subscriptions.
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.320]   I believe everybody will have 7 or 8 subscriptions, not 1 or 2.
[00:48:33.320 --> 00:48:34.600]   And you'll just all our cart.
[00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:38.560]   And we'll make those providers more honest, because they'll be harder working for their
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:40.200]   money, because they're not bundled and getting a piece of money.
[00:48:40.200 --> 00:48:41.200]   You're paying for HBO.
[00:48:41.200 --> 00:48:43.240]   They better give you the results, or you're going to cancel next month.
[00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:46.800]   Yeah, if Game of Thrones wraps up and you don't like anything else, you're going to
[00:48:46.800 --> 00:48:49.080]   pause and I'll come back if you do Game of Thrones.
[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:50.080]   And it's easy.
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:51.920]   Apple gives you an easy way to manage your subscriptions.
[00:48:51.920 --> 00:48:52.920]   They buried a bit.
[00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:55.160]   They can move it up a little bit, but they're still there.
[00:48:55.160 --> 00:48:57.320]   They're all there, and you can suspend them.
[00:48:57.320 --> 00:48:58.320]   Unsubscribe.
[00:48:58.320 --> 00:48:59.320]   It's not-- you don't have to go to--
[00:48:59.320 --> 00:49:00.320]   To a Wall Street Journal.
[00:49:00.320 --> 00:49:01.320]   With a Wall Street Journal.
[00:49:01.320 --> 00:49:02.320]   Pay-age and find it.
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:05.560]   The Wall Street Journal makes you call them on the phone to unsubscribe.
[00:49:05.560 --> 00:49:06.760]   A lot of companies do that.
[00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:09.760]   And I was like, what if we do like security?
[00:49:09.760 --> 00:49:14.160]   I'm like, so you can take my credit card online, and that's not a security threat.
[00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:17.200]   But be stopping paying you as a security threat.
[00:49:17.200 --> 00:49:18.760]   That's not a security threat.
[00:49:18.760 --> 00:49:20.560]   It's just so annoying.
[00:49:20.560 --> 00:49:24.240]   So what are cable companies going to do, because they don't want to be internet service
[00:49:24.240 --> 00:49:25.240]   providers?
[00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:26.240]   That's what they're going to do.
[00:49:26.240 --> 00:49:27.240]   That's the future.
[00:49:27.240 --> 00:49:28.240]   That's it.
[00:49:28.240 --> 00:49:30.520]   And that's where they're all going to be charging you for these upgraded services.
[00:49:30.520 --> 00:49:32.520]   And they'll try to bundle.
[00:49:32.520 --> 00:49:35.000]   I think you were talking about early on the tech guy.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:37.160]   Yeah, you know, I didn't know this.
[00:49:37.160 --> 00:49:39.560]   The spectrum is reselling Verizon services.
[00:49:39.560 --> 00:49:41.880]   Spectrum phone service.
[00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:47.040]   Xfinity has its own phone services based on its Wi-Fi access points, which is probably
[00:49:47.040 --> 00:49:48.040]   not very good.
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:49.040]   Yeah, no.
[00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:50.720]   You probably heard then this story.
[00:49:50.720 --> 00:49:52.520]   Spectrum is getting kicked out of New York State.
[00:49:52.520 --> 00:49:53.520]   Really?
[00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:54.520]   I love it.
[00:49:54.520 --> 00:49:55.520]   I love it.
[00:49:55.520 --> 00:49:56.520]   Why?
[00:49:56.520 --> 00:49:57.520]   I just--
[00:49:57.520 --> 00:49:58.520]   I celebrate it.
[00:49:58.520 --> 00:50:01.320]   And I know that the other company like them does in these circumstances, they promised a
[00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:02.940]   bunch of stuff in order to get the deal.
[00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:04.720]   And they didn't deliver on those things, which is--
[00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:05.720]   Oh, great.
[00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:06.720]   And they never planned to.
[00:50:06.720 --> 00:50:07.720]   They never planned-- none of them do.
[00:50:07.720 --> 00:50:10.840]   But then New York, somehow-- and for some reason, they did the right thing.
[00:50:10.840 --> 00:50:12.400]   And they're like, OK, you didn't do it.
[00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:14.640]   Government thinking in the best interest of citizen--
[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:22.120]   The Time Warner-- the Time Warner charter merger in New York happened in 2016 as a contingency
[00:50:22.120 --> 00:50:23.120]   on that.
[00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:27.120]   New York State says, all right, but you have to provide high-speed internet in underserved
[00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:28.120]   rural areas.
[00:50:28.120 --> 00:50:32.520]   You're going to make so much money on Manhattan that you can afford to do this.
[00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:33.520]   This is our price.
[00:50:33.520 --> 00:50:34.520]   Syracuse, Albany.
[00:50:34.520 --> 00:50:36.080]   Yeah, they agreed to do it.
[00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:37.280]   But they didn't do it.
[00:50:37.280 --> 00:50:38.920]   They said there's in their statement.
[00:50:38.920 --> 00:50:39.920]   They said, well, wait a minute.
[00:50:39.920 --> 00:50:45.760]   We extended the reach of our broadband network to more than 86,000 new homes and businesses,
[00:50:45.760 --> 00:50:48.480]   but they had agreed to at least 145,000.
[00:50:48.480 --> 00:50:51.040]   So they're even admitting they didn't do what they said they were going to do.
[00:50:51.040 --> 00:50:52.040]   Now here's the thing.
[00:50:52.040 --> 00:50:53.360]   I don't think they care.
[00:50:53.360 --> 00:50:58.360]   They're like, well, I'm not going to do it.
[00:50:58.360 --> 00:50:59.360]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:50:59.360 --> 00:51:00.360]   I'm not going to do it.
[00:51:00.360 --> 00:51:01.360]   I'm not going to do it.

[01:11:22.360 --> 01:11:23.360]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:11:23.360 --> 01:11:24.360]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:25.360]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:26.360]   I'm not going to do it.

[01:11:30.360 --> 01:11:31.360]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:11:31.360 --> 01:11:32.360]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:11:32.360 --> 01:11:33.360]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:34.360]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:35.360]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:11:35.360 --> 01:11:36.360]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:11:36.360 --> 01:11:37.360]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:11:37.360 --> 01:11:38.360]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:11:38.360 --> 01:11:39.360]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:11:39.360 --> 01:11:40.360]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:41.360]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:11:41.360 --> 01:11:42.360]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:43.360]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:11:43.360 --> 01:11:44.360]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:11:44.360 --> 01:11:45.360]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:11:45.360 --> 01:11:46.360]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:47.360]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:11:47.360 --> 01:11:48.360]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:11:48.360 --> 01:11:49.360]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:11:49.360 --> 01:11:50.360]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:11:50.360 --> 01:11:51.360]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:11:51.360 --> 01:11:52.360]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:53.360]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:54.360]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:11:54.360 --> 01:11:55.360]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:56.360]   I'm not going to do it.
[01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:57.360]   Plus, it's multi-factor.
[01:11:57.360 --> 01:11:59.360]   The hackers have one more option.
[01:11:59.360 --> 01:12:02.360]   They paid all that money for the fingerprint company, Apple.
[01:12:02.360 --> 01:12:04.760]   Then they got rid of it for the face.
[01:12:04.760 --> 01:12:05.760]   Why not have both?
[01:12:05.760 --> 01:12:06.760]   I think they will in the long run.
[01:12:06.760 --> 01:12:07.760]   I think they will.
[01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:08.760]   They'll be so dope.
[01:12:08.760 --> 01:12:09.760]   They'll be so dope.
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:10.760]   As soon as they can perfect the screen.
[01:12:10.760 --> 01:12:16.280]   Apparently, Samsung's having an event with the Note 9 in a week on August 9th.
[01:12:16.280 --> 01:12:18.080]   Then there's going to be the S10.
[01:12:18.080 --> 01:12:19.080]   I'm not sure.
[01:12:19.080 --> 01:12:20.640]   I think it'll be the S10, not the Note 9.
[01:12:20.640 --> 01:12:25.320]   But apparently Samsung has solved that problem of fingerprints through the screen.
[01:12:25.320 --> 01:12:27.320]   You don't need a fingerprint reader.
[01:12:27.320 --> 01:12:28.320]   There's a certain area.
[01:12:28.320 --> 01:12:29.320]   How is that possible?
[01:12:29.320 --> 01:12:32.360]   Well, they put a reader underneath it and go through the screen.
[01:12:32.360 --> 01:12:36.640]   Apparently, the rumor was, I don't know if it's true and Apple has denied it, that Apple
[01:12:36.640 --> 01:12:38.000]   couldn't make that work.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.680]   That's why they knew they were abandoning the hardware.
[01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:43.520]   I love the Pixel 2 has the finger on the back.
[01:12:43.520 --> 01:12:46.400]   It's so perfect when you pick up your phone.
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:47.680]   It just goes.
[01:12:47.680 --> 01:12:49.440]   I would like to be able to have both.
[01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:51.560]   I would have back and the front.
[01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:53.400]   Face to buy them.
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:58.560]   Everybody gets mad at me when I say this, but I don't find it to be that reliable.
[01:12:58.560 --> 01:13:00.280]   When I wear sunglasses, it doesn't work.
[01:13:00.280 --> 01:13:01.760]   But other than that, it works pretty well.
[01:13:01.760 --> 01:13:04.400]   I'll take the time that really doesn't work for me.
[01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:12.120]   When I'm in bed, lying like this, I have to sit up and do this.
[01:13:12.120 --> 01:13:17.240]   Hello, hello, hello phone unlock, and then I can lie down.
[01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:18.400]   And I find that annoying.
[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:19.400]   Siri, wake up.
[01:13:19.400 --> 01:13:21.600]   So it would be really nice to me if it had a fingerprint.
[01:13:21.600 --> 01:13:23.720]   You raised a point that I actually hadn't thought about.
[01:13:23.720 --> 01:13:25.200]   That is half as secure in a way.
[01:13:25.200 --> 01:13:26.200]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:13:26.200 --> 01:13:28.120]   Also, I think your phone is trying to tell you something.
[01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:29.560]   You really shouldn't be using your phone in bed.
[01:13:29.560 --> 01:13:30.560]   I don't care.
[01:13:30.560 --> 01:13:31.760]   I'm going to stop it.
[01:13:31.760 --> 01:13:32.760]   All right.
[01:13:32.760 --> 01:13:36.960]   Now, you know, I know I'm not getting as a good night asleep level.
[01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:40.800]   You know, the nights that I wake up and I think, oh, I didn't use my phone last night,
[01:13:40.800 --> 01:13:41.800]   I feel really good about that.
[01:13:41.800 --> 01:13:42.800]   I have the ultimate for that.
[01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:43.800]   I just use Audible now.
[01:13:43.800 --> 01:13:44.800]   I put on a nice audio book.
[01:13:44.800 --> 01:13:48.080]   I put it on 30 minutes or 15 minutes depending on how tired I am.
[01:13:48.080 --> 01:13:50.240]   I listened to an audio book.
[01:13:50.240 --> 01:13:52.600]   And I had the AirPods and I fall asleep.
[01:13:52.600 --> 01:13:54.880]   And then in the morning, I have to find them.
[01:13:54.880 --> 01:13:57.120]   Sometimes they're embedded in your ear canal.
[01:13:57.120 --> 01:14:00.040]   No, but I'm like literally like moving the white comfortably.
[01:14:00.040 --> 01:14:01.680]   I'm trying to find the white in the air.
[01:14:01.680 --> 01:14:02.680]   That's hilarious.
[01:14:02.680 --> 01:14:03.680]   I've lost two sets of AirPods.
[01:14:03.680 --> 01:14:04.680]   It's not good.
[01:14:04.680 --> 01:14:05.680]   I've lost two sets as well.
[01:14:05.680 --> 01:14:06.680]   I have two.
[01:14:06.680 --> 01:14:07.680]   I just got another one.
[01:14:07.680 --> 01:14:09.520]   When Leo's on his deathbed, he's going to say, you know what?
[01:14:09.520 --> 01:14:10.880]   I should have used my phone more.
[01:14:10.880 --> 01:14:11.880]   You know what?
[01:14:11.880 --> 01:14:13.960]   I'm going to say, I've got a hard thing in...
[01:14:13.960 --> 01:14:17.600]   Oh my God, there's the AirPod I lost 43 years ago.
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:19.440]   I hope it's 43 years ago.
[01:14:19.440 --> 01:14:21.360]   Anyway, use these hardware keys.
[01:14:21.360 --> 01:14:25.560]   I am glad that Google publicized this and said it works.
[01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:27.360]   Completely eliminated phishing attacks.
[01:14:27.360 --> 01:14:31.680]   And boy, if you're a company, especially like Google phishing attacks, are your worst nightmare.
[01:14:31.680 --> 01:14:33.600]   Look what happened to Sony Pictures Entertainment.
[01:14:33.600 --> 01:14:34.600]   Passwords and email.
[01:14:34.600 --> 01:14:35.600]   Look what happened to the T&C.
[01:14:35.600 --> 01:14:36.600]   Democratic National Committee.
[01:14:36.600 --> 01:14:37.600]   Yeah.
[01:14:37.600 --> 01:14:38.600]   That was how they got them.
[01:14:38.600 --> 01:14:39.600]   It was spear phishing.
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:41.520]   I'm just like, we need you to change your password.
[01:14:41.520 --> 01:14:44.760]   And then what they do is they pass the parameter of the email address.
[01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:48.080]   So when you go to the landing page and your email address is already populated.
[01:14:48.080 --> 01:14:49.080]   Right.
[01:14:49.080 --> 01:14:50.080]   And it's a little bit better.
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:52.080]   Oh, well, welcome back, Mike.
[01:14:52.080 --> 01:14:54.160]   It's time for you to change your password.
[01:14:54.160 --> 01:14:56.000]   It's like, yeah, we made this webpage for you.
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:15:00.960]   But a huge number of people this week are discovering that these keys exist.
[01:15:00.960 --> 01:15:04.840]   I mean, we nerds do these things all the time, but the general public has no awareness
[01:15:04.840 --> 01:15:05.840]   that they even exist.
[01:15:05.840 --> 01:15:06.840]   They're not cheap.
[01:15:06.840 --> 01:15:07.920]   And they started 20 bucks.
[01:15:07.920 --> 01:15:09.880]   The one you want probably is a little more expensive.
[01:15:09.880 --> 01:15:10.880]   They're going to come down.
[01:15:10.880 --> 01:15:12.280]   If they do it at scale, they're going to come down to 15 as well.
[01:15:12.280 --> 01:15:17.880]   These are pretty cool because every time you push the button, you insert it in a USB connection.
[01:15:17.880 --> 01:15:20.480]   I have to get a Type C adapter because of my Apple.
[01:15:20.480 --> 01:15:21.760]   But it still works.
[01:15:21.760 --> 01:15:24.520]   Every time you push the button, you get a new very long code.
[01:15:24.520 --> 01:15:26.760]   I mean, it's 40 characters.
[01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:28.320]   And it's changes.
[01:15:28.320 --> 01:15:30.600]   Most of the characters change every time.
[01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:32.520]   So it's a one time use.
[01:15:32.520 --> 01:15:34.520]   The second time, it's no good anymore.
[01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:39.160]   I want LastPass to come out with something where if that key is inserted in your laptop,
[01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:43.440]   all passwords are just automatically filled in and you never have to deal with it.
[01:15:43.440 --> 01:15:46.680]   I have to say that the fingerprint reader, do you use your fingerprint reader on your
[01:15:46.680 --> 01:15:47.680]   MacBook Pro?
[01:15:47.680 --> 01:15:48.680]   I do.
[01:15:48.680 --> 01:15:51.000]   And it will unlock your password vault, right?
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.120]   I guess it does.
[01:15:53.120 --> 01:15:58.800]   That's because of course with your password vault, you're using a very long passcode,
[01:15:58.800 --> 01:16:00.400]   you know, 40 character passcode.
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:03.720]   It's a pain to have to type that and I have to type it a lot.
[01:16:03.720 --> 01:16:06.120]   Having the fingerprint reader now, maybe that makes it a lot less secure.
[01:16:06.120 --> 01:16:07.120]   I don't know.
[01:16:07.120 --> 01:16:12.280]   Fingerprints are maybe not the best security possible, but still.
[01:16:12.280 --> 01:16:14.240]   Anyway, good news.
[01:16:14.240 --> 01:16:15.240]   Good news.
[01:16:15.240 --> 01:16:16.440]   We'll all be using hardware keys.
[01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:20.680]   Although, frankly, somebody's got to figure out a way to get rid of passwords entirely.
[01:16:20.680 --> 01:16:21.680]   Yes.
[01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:26.680]   They have to mandate those for every politician and every single government worker.
[01:16:26.680 --> 01:16:28.440]   What do you, everybody in security has to have that.
[01:16:28.440 --> 01:16:29.440]   What do you bet?
[01:16:29.440 --> 01:16:33.040]   The DNC, where the chairman of the DNC is these days, do you think they are using that?
[01:16:33.040 --> 01:16:34.040]   No.
[01:16:34.040 --> 01:16:36.680]   The government is so behind, they're going to start rolling these out in like 20 years.
[01:16:36.680 --> 01:16:37.680]   Well, you know what?
[01:16:37.680 --> 01:16:41.240]   Now that if you have Google Docs, you should just come with it.
[01:16:41.240 --> 01:16:44.680]   Like when you pay your five bucks a month, it should just, they should force people to
[01:16:44.680 --> 01:16:45.680]   have it.
[01:16:45.680 --> 01:16:47.840]   It's worthwhile for Google to do that sort of thing.
[01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:48.840]   So then it's a deal with all this.
[01:16:48.840 --> 01:16:53.920]   So we use LastPass Enterprise as sponsor, and we require two factor for all our employees
[01:16:53.920 --> 01:16:55.480]   when they're using the corporate company.
[01:16:55.480 --> 01:16:57.200]   We don't make it a hardware factor.
[01:16:57.200 --> 01:16:59.280]   You can make it if you want.
[01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:00.720]   But you have to use an authenticator.
[01:17:00.720 --> 01:17:01.720]   We don't use SMS.
[01:17:01.720 --> 01:17:06.080]   It would also be good if every time people logged in, you had an audit trial where it
[01:17:06.080 --> 01:17:08.080]   just emailed you like, "This person logged in."
[01:17:08.080 --> 01:17:12.840]   Like, "I get them once in a while because I use a VPN when I'm traveling abroad because
[01:17:12.840 --> 01:17:19.240]   I want to listen to SiriusXM or I want to use Netflix when I'm overseas."
[01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:24.960]   And if I log in from another city or a global location, you can get that like, "Hey, is
[01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:25.960]   this you?
[01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:26.960]   Facebook does it?"
[01:17:26.960 --> 01:17:27.960]   Google does it.
[01:17:27.960 --> 01:17:29.960]   I actually travel so much constant.
[01:17:29.960 --> 01:17:30.960]   I know.
[01:17:30.960 --> 01:17:31.960]   What have you used to say?
[01:17:31.960 --> 01:17:35.640]   I've logged everything but the US and LastPass when I was in Japan, I suddenly had to go through
[01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:38.800]   this double authentication process I'd forgotten.
[01:17:38.800 --> 01:17:39.960]   But that's good.
[01:17:39.960 --> 01:17:42.360]   I was happy about it.
[01:17:42.360 --> 01:17:47.320]   So here's probably a stupid question that maybe you guys can answer.
[01:17:47.320 --> 01:17:55.080]   I think Apple should have deals with companies that offer two-factor authentication where
[01:17:55.080 --> 01:17:57.640]   it all goes through iMessage.
[01:17:57.640 --> 01:17:59.480]   Because iMessage is very secure.
[01:17:59.480 --> 01:18:00.480]   That's more secure.
[01:18:00.480 --> 01:18:01.480]   Yes, it's very secure.
[01:18:01.480 --> 01:18:04.680]   I mean, if you go iMessage to iMessage, it's highly secure.
[01:18:04.680 --> 01:18:07.480]   So why aren't they working with companies that offer two-factor?
[01:18:07.480 --> 01:18:11.000]   Because that would be a secure way to get it through SMS, but it would be through iMessage.
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.000]   It's not.
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:13.000]   It's the data and it's increased.
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:14.000]   Exactly.
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:15.080]   That's an excellent idea.
[01:18:15.080 --> 01:18:19.520]   And you have to verify, you have to authenticate on your MacBook or your iPhone.
[01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:22.120]   And it's a far more Apple-y solution than a dongle-y.
[01:18:22.120 --> 01:18:27.520]   Well, actually, you know, actually, dongles are associated with Apple.
[01:18:27.520 --> 01:18:29.680]   Apple does not support dongles very well though.
[01:18:29.680 --> 01:18:33.720]   They do carry around my Type-C adapter.
[01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:37.360]   Was there anything more to say about the Tesla surfboard just that they made 200?
[01:18:37.360 --> 01:18:38.360]   It's expensive.
[01:18:38.360 --> 01:18:39.360]   They sold out.
[01:18:39.360 --> 01:18:41.800]   I got two followers who are getting them.
[01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:42.800]   And so I'm going to be monitoring them.
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:44.800]   So they made 200 of them for $1,500 each.
[01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:47.920]   They didn't sell the quarter million immediately.
[01:18:47.920 --> 01:18:48.920]   Is that how many?
[01:18:48.920 --> 01:18:49.920]   Is that the number?
[01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:50.920]   That's what they say.
[01:18:50.920 --> 01:18:59.440]   $2,000 to $5,000, $200 in all made to order shipping expected to $2,500 in the aftermarket.
[01:18:59.440 --> 01:19:00.600]   I think they charge $1,500.
[01:19:00.600 --> 01:19:01.600]   $1,500?
[01:19:01.600 --> 01:19:02.600]   Yeah.
[01:19:02.600 --> 01:19:03.600]   And they sold a couple of hundred.
[01:19:03.600 --> 01:19:04.600]   Yeah.
[01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:05.600]   Oh, yeah.
[01:19:05.600 --> 01:19:06.600]   People love that.
[01:19:06.600 --> 01:19:07.600]   Oh, you're right.
[01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:08.600]   That was eBay, if you wanted to buy it on eBay.
[01:19:08.600 --> 01:19:13.480]   Remember the Intel surfboard from probably 15 years ago?
[01:19:13.480 --> 01:19:15.520]   They embedded a tablet into the surfboard.
[01:19:15.520 --> 01:19:16.520]   See, there was a Wi-Fi.
[01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:17.520]   Oh, my gosh.
[01:19:17.520 --> 01:19:20.520]   So you could sit there while surfing and you could not watch cat videos.
[01:19:20.520 --> 01:19:21.520]   Did anybody do that?
[01:19:21.520 --> 01:19:22.520]   No, nobody.
[01:19:22.520 --> 01:19:23.960]   I don't think they actually sold it.
[01:19:23.960 --> 01:19:26.320]   And it's so boring waiting for that great way.
[01:19:26.320 --> 01:19:27.320]   Yeah.
[01:19:27.320 --> 01:19:29.760]   I've got to watch some cat videos.
[01:19:29.760 --> 01:19:30.760]   Alphabet.
[01:19:30.760 --> 01:19:33.240]   Don't watch Jaws when you're just watching.
[01:19:33.240 --> 01:19:34.320]   Watch Jaws.
[01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:35.320]   Watch the Megman.
[01:19:35.320 --> 01:19:37.160]   Dude, I'm watching the Megalodon.
[01:19:37.160 --> 01:19:38.560]   Are you excited about the Meg?
[01:19:38.560 --> 01:19:39.560]   Dude.
[01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:40.560]   Dude.
[01:19:40.560 --> 01:19:50.920]   Do you see the bottom of the water and sharks swimming underneath your surfboard?
[01:19:50.920 --> 01:19:52.320]   Oh, like you're seeing through it.
[01:19:52.320 --> 01:19:54.320]   That shark is so not cool.
[01:19:54.320 --> 01:19:56.800]   That's not cool, dude.
[01:19:56.800 --> 01:19:59.080]   Second quarter results for Alphabet.
[01:19:59.080 --> 01:20:04.520]   That's the boss, the Google boss.
[01:20:04.520 --> 01:20:07.040]   Revenue increase year over year.
[01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:08.040]   26%.
[01:20:08.040 --> 01:20:10.680]   That's pretty nice.
[01:20:10.680 --> 01:20:11.680]   That's hefty.
[01:20:11.680 --> 01:20:13.520]   It's a big number now, so you're not going to double it.
[01:20:13.520 --> 01:20:14.520]   But take it.
[01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:15.520]   Become a growth company.
[01:20:15.520 --> 01:20:17.000]   Incredible, yes.
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:21.720]   Operating income was lower because I got this $5 billion fine thing.
[01:20:21.720 --> 01:20:25.080]   On top of the original $2 billion, so this is the one for Android and the previous one
[01:20:25.080 --> 01:20:26.080]   was for shopping.
[01:20:26.080 --> 01:20:30.120]   So the EU is going to go through every single feature and there's probably a dozen fines
[01:20:30.120 --> 01:20:31.120]   out there for them.
[01:20:31.120 --> 01:20:32.120]   Yeah, it's good work.
[01:20:32.120 --> 01:20:34.480]   They only made $2.8 billion less quarter.
[01:20:34.480 --> 01:20:35.480]   They print money.
[01:20:35.480 --> 01:20:37.960]   It's a little less than a billion a quarter.
[01:20:37.960 --> 01:20:38.960]   They print.
[01:20:38.960 --> 01:20:39.960]   Print money.
[01:20:39.960 --> 01:20:43.160]   Net income, alluded to EPS.
[01:20:43.160 --> 01:20:44.160]   I don't read balance sheets.
[01:20:44.160 --> 01:20:45.160]   You probably do.
[01:20:45.160 --> 01:20:49.000]   Effective tax rate went up 24%.
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:51.240]   That's probably because they took all that offshore stuff.
[01:20:51.240 --> 01:20:53.680]   I'm guessing it was the repatriation.
[01:20:53.680 --> 01:20:57.920]   That was, I mean, we don't want to show it to get political, but one of the things Trump
[01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:03.280]   did really well was allowing people to repatriate that cash at a one time charge that wasn't
[01:21:03.280 --> 01:21:04.280]   so expensive.
[01:21:04.280 --> 01:21:05.280]   Was it 15% or was it?
[01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:07.880]   Was it 15% or was it the number that would have been much higher?
[01:21:07.880 --> 01:21:13.280]   And those companies, because we get that money back here, then you can use it for M&A here.
[01:21:13.280 --> 01:21:14.280]   Mergers and Agritations and stuff.
[01:21:14.280 --> 01:21:17.680]   That's the theory, although a lot of what happened was Apple used to buy back stock.
[01:21:17.680 --> 01:21:18.680]   Which is fine.
[01:21:18.680 --> 01:21:21.720]   If you buy back the stock, the company, each share becomes worth more money.
[01:21:21.720 --> 01:21:23.800]   Yeah, but it doesn't boost the American economy.
[01:21:23.800 --> 01:21:26.240]   It just makes the Apple shareholders richer.
[01:21:26.240 --> 01:21:27.240]   It does.
[01:21:27.240 --> 01:21:30.480]   And then hopefully there's some trickle down there, but probably not.
[01:21:30.480 --> 01:21:35.720]   But it does give them the ability to invest more and majority of the money Apple makes
[01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:36.720]   goes to America.
[01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:38.200]   Yeah, better to have it than the US.
[01:21:38.200 --> 01:21:39.200]   I agree.
[01:21:39.200 --> 01:21:43.120]   And also, if you look at the EU, they're finding these companies and they could change the
[01:21:43.120 --> 01:21:46.640]   tax rules and have retroactively.
[01:21:46.640 --> 01:21:48.800]   So they retroactively change Apple's tax bill.
[01:21:48.800 --> 01:21:49.800]   Is that ridiculous?
[01:21:49.800 --> 01:21:53.480]   And they're just like, "Yeah, by the way, the tax bill is now this and Apple had to negotiate
[01:21:53.480 --> 01:21:54.480]   with them."
[01:21:54.480 --> 01:21:56.720]   So you want to get that money out of there.
[01:21:56.720 --> 01:21:59.800]   Of course, the big, I mean, so they made money.
[01:21:59.800 --> 01:22:03.320]   But I think what a lot of people are interested in when they see the quarterly results from
[01:22:03.320 --> 01:22:06.440]   Alphabet is the other bets.
[01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:10.520]   That's the Weimos, the Veriles, the Nest.
[01:22:10.520 --> 01:22:11.720]   Nest is in there?
[01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:13.720]   Nest is another bet.
[01:22:13.720 --> 01:22:15.880]   Nest is another bets, I believe.
[01:22:15.880 --> 01:22:21.120]   Moonshots like fiber, Chronicle, which is a cybersecurity thing.
[01:22:21.120 --> 01:22:22.120]   Yeah, all that.
[01:22:22.120 --> 01:22:27.680]   Don't you get the feeling that all these things Alphabet is doing are somehow going to enable
[01:22:27.680 --> 01:22:33.400]   the company to increase by several orders of magnitude over the next 20 years on Apple?
[01:22:33.400 --> 01:22:34.400]   Well, they only...
[01:22:34.400 --> 01:22:35.400]   Well, that's the plan.
[01:22:35.400 --> 01:22:36.400]   Yeah.
[01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:37.400]   The plan is to have one.
[01:22:37.400 --> 01:22:38.400]   Yeah.
[01:22:38.400 --> 01:22:39.400]   They only...
[01:22:39.400 --> 01:22:40.400]   They only...
[01:22:40.400 --> 01:22:41.400]   They only...
[01:22:41.400 --> 01:22:42.400]   Look, we get one more Android.
[01:22:42.400 --> 01:22:44.080]   And if you look at the pillars of Google, the search franchise, then you have Gmail, Chrome,
[01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:47.400]   and Android, which don't make any money, but drive the search franchise and you have YouTube,
[01:22:47.400 --> 01:22:48.880]   which in and of itself is a...
[01:22:48.880 --> 01:22:49.880]   It's a revenue generator.
[01:22:49.880 --> 01:22:50.880]   Incredible revenue generator.
[01:22:50.880 --> 01:22:52.880]   But there's really only two revenue generators.
[01:22:52.880 --> 01:22:57.120]   Google, Search, and YouTube, all the other ones serve those other masters.
[01:22:57.120 --> 01:22:59.480]   With over a billion users in each one.
[01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:07.480]   So they have Chrome, Android, and I guess apps, they make a little bit of money off apps.
[01:23:07.480 --> 01:23:08.480]   That's really...
[01:23:08.480 --> 01:23:11.640]   But something like 80% ads on Search.
[01:23:11.640 --> 01:23:12.640]   I mean, that's really...
[01:23:12.640 --> 01:23:13.640]   Yeah.
[01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:14.640]   But you do have Gmail...
[01:23:14.640 --> 01:23:15.640]   But that's the problem.
[01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:17.240]   They've got to find the next pillar.
[01:23:17.240 --> 01:23:18.880]   Did you try a social network?
[01:23:18.880 --> 01:23:19.880]   I did that.
[01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:20.880]   Yeah.
[01:23:20.880 --> 01:23:22.640]   No, I mean, they're printing money.
[01:23:22.640 --> 01:23:28.240]   If you look at the gains in online advertising last year, 90% went to two companies, Facebook
[01:23:28.240 --> 01:23:29.760]   and Google, of the gain.
[01:23:29.760 --> 01:23:34.160]   So they're actually taking more market share Google and Facebook now.
[01:23:34.160 --> 01:23:35.280]   So they become juggernauts.
[01:23:35.280 --> 01:23:40.320]   And when you look at advertisers, they really are picking one of two things.
[01:23:40.320 --> 01:23:44.280]   If they want to do really granular stuff, they pick Facebook and Google.
[01:23:44.280 --> 01:23:45.280]   And then if they want to do something with...
[01:23:45.280 --> 01:23:46.280]   Targeted.
[01:23:46.280 --> 01:23:48.360]   Yeah, like hyper-targeted to the individual level.
[01:23:48.360 --> 01:23:49.360]   Especially Facebook.
[01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:50.360]   Yeah.
[01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:51.360]   Right?
[01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:52.360]   Yeah.
[01:23:52.360 --> 01:23:54.240]   So Facebook does probably know more about you.
[01:23:54.240 --> 01:23:55.240]   Facebook knows your graph.
[01:23:55.240 --> 01:23:57.160]   Google's pretty efficient, I think.
[01:23:57.160 --> 01:23:59.400]   But Google knows his intent a lot more.
[01:23:59.400 --> 01:24:00.400]   So they see what's in your Gmail.
[01:24:00.400 --> 01:24:01.400]   That's a very good point.
[01:24:01.400 --> 01:24:03.040]   They know you're making more valuable than your graph.
[01:24:03.040 --> 01:24:05.320]   It is more valuable in the moment.
[01:24:05.320 --> 01:24:10.880]   So when you type in Tesla or I Jaguar or Volvo, they know you're in the market for a car.
[01:24:10.880 --> 01:24:12.120]   That's very powerful.
[01:24:12.120 --> 01:24:19.440]   What Facebook can infer what something called audiences is, and it's called lookalike.
[01:24:19.440 --> 01:24:23.680]   If you were looking for cars, and I was looking for cars, and we're all friends with Mike,
[01:24:23.680 --> 01:24:25.040]   maybe Mike's looking for a car.
[01:24:25.040 --> 01:24:29.040]   So what they will do is they'll say, "Expand, give us a bunch of email addresses."
[01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:35.320]   You give them 10,000 email addresses of people who are on the iJaguar mailing list.
[01:24:35.320 --> 01:24:37.440]   Then it says, "Give me people like that."
[01:24:37.440 --> 01:24:41.400]   And then it goes and uses an algorithm to try to find similar people, and it's so effective.
[01:24:41.400 --> 01:24:43.160]   So that's like psychographic weirdness.
[01:24:43.160 --> 01:24:47.160]   But the other thing they're buying is podcasts and sponsorships.
[01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:49.760]   So that actually- And this is the part where Jason and I-
[01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:52.840]   No, but it's amazing because- Thank the Lord.
[01:24:52.840 --> 01:24:54.800]   People do want influencers.
[01:24:54.800 --> 01:25:00.040]   So influencer marketing, whether it's Instagram or podcasts, it falls into the same thing.
[01:25:00.040 --> 01:25:03.760]   There's nothing better than your friend or a friend of a friend saying, "Hey, I use
[01:25:03.760 --> 01:25:04.760]   this product."
[01:25:04.760 --> 01:25:09.520]   Blue-Eppers- I can't pretend to have known this, but it really has made it possible to
[01:25:09.520 --> 01:25:11.240]   make a living as a podcast.
[01:25:11.240 --> 01:25:12.800]   There's an extra part.
[01:25:12.800 --> 01:25:14.400]   It's not just your friend.
[01:25:14.400 --> 01:25:17.000]   People I think want to support the podcast they like.
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:20.560]   And so they will actively go out and use those codes.
[01:25:20.560 --> 01:25:21.960]   And boy, you can't get better than that.
[01:25:21.960 --> 01:25:22.960]   So thank you.
[01:25:22.960 --> 01:25:26.760]   I really appreciate those of you who do that.
[01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:28.720]   It is one of the ways we can continue to monetize.
[01:25:28.720 --> 01:25:29.720]   It's been difficult though.
[01:25:29.720 --> 01:25:32.880]   I have to say, I don't know what your experience has been, but the last two years, so many
[01:25:32.880 --> 01:25:38.680]   new podcasts out, so much attention going to political stuff away from stuff that we do.
[01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:40.520]   Yeah, but we've been sold out for five years.
[01:25:40.520 --> 01:25:42.120]   We've been sold out for a number of years.
[01:25:42.120 --> 01:25:46.840]   It's like, I think there's more choice out there, but people always have flight to quality
[01:25:46.840 --> 01:25:50.360]   and to the hosts who can really read the ads and have that loyal audience.
[01:25:50.360 --> 01:25:54.080]   The thing that's troubling is- I do worry though sometimes that Facebook and Google
[01:25:54.080 --> 01:25:58.640]   are so efficient that advertisers are going to say, "Why would we spare money anywhere
[01:25:58.640 --> 01:25:59.640]   else?"
[01:25:59.640 --> 01:26:02.080]   Actually, the real people should worry about network television.
[01:26:02.080 --> 01:26:06.440]   The network television, regular broadcast radio, and the one that's most at risk is
[01:26:06.440 --> 01:26:07.600]   journalism newspaper.
[01:26:07.600 --> 01:26:10.480]   So obviously, journalism is just tanked.
[01:26:10.480 --> 01:26:13.760]   And because they're nothing about their user, there's no niche that they're-
[01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:15.400]   Billboards do better.
[01:26:15.400 --> 01:26:16.400]   Yeah.
[01:26:16.400 --> 01:26:19.600]   Billboards have a better idea of who's going up and down the 280 that I want on newspapers.
[01:26:19.600 --> 01:26:20.600]   Wow.
[01:26:20.600 --> 01:26:21.600]   So it's very problematic.
[01:26:21.600 --> 01:26:25.240]   And the thing is, Facebook and Google know you're a New York Times reader.
[01:26:25.240 --> 01:26:28.520]   So they're bundling the New York Times and Wall Street Journal and selling that as affluent
[01:26:28.520 --> 01:26:29.520]   news readers.
[01:26:29.520 --> 01:26:30.520]   Oh Lord.
[01:26:30.520 --> 01:26:31.520]   Because they know you have it on your phone.
[01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:33.520]   Completely steal all the revenue from them.
[01:26:33.520 --> 01:26:37.280]   So they steal out from underneath the New York Times and Wall Street Journal, and gadget,
[01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:38.280]   whatever.
[01:26:38.280 --> 01:26:40.880]   They sell those people, and then they resell them as like news enthusiasts.
[01:26:40.880 --> 01:26:42.480]   What if the journal hates Google so much?
[01:26:42.480 --> 01:26:43.960]   Well, there's a lot of reason to hate them.
[01:26:43.960 --> 01:26:47.560]   And I think what's- if Facebook and Google really want to help, what they should do is
[01:26:47.560 --> 01:26:50.040]   they should license content from the news groups.
[01:26:50.040 --> 01:26:51.160]   Give some of that money back.
[01:26:51.160 --> 01:26:52.600]   Just give them 50 million a year.
[01:26:52.600 --> 01:26:53.600]   What was it proposed that?
[01:26:53.600 --> 01:26:54.920]   Robert Murdoch proposed that.
[01:26:54.920 --> 01:26:56.400]   He proposed the licensing fee.
[01:26:56.400 --> 01:26:59.120]   It would be a super easy thing for them to do.
[01:26:59.120 --> 01:27:03.360]   Just buy 20 articles a day from the journal for 50 million a year, 100 million a year.
[01:27:03.360 --> 01:27:04.560]   Let them pay for some journalists.
[01:27:04.560 --> 01:27:08.200]   Plus as human beings, they might want to live in a world where newspapers and news
[01:27:08.200 --> 01:27:09.200]   - have resources. - Have resources.
[01:27:09.200 --> 01:27:10.200]   Check them out.
[01:27:10.200 --> 01:27:11.200]   Yeah, maybe.
[01:27:11.200 --> 01:27:12.600]   Well, this is a good question.
[01:27:12.600 --> 01:27:15.920]   Are they human beings?
[01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:18.600]   This is a conversation we have a lot on here.
[01:27:18.600 --> 01:27:23.080]   Can you blame somebody like Mark Zuckerberg for what Facebook has become?
[01:27:23.080 --> 01:27:26.680]   And I've always said, no, he's just optimizing for engagement.
[01:27:26.680 --> 01:27:29.800]   He's an engineer and his team are engineers solving a problem.
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:30.800]   Incorrect.
[01:27:30.800 --> 01:27:31.800]   Yeah, every thing so.
[01:27:31.800 --> 01:27:32.800]   You don't think so.
[01:27:32.800 --> 01:27:33.800]   Yeah, me too.
[01:27:33.800 --> 01:27:34.800]   Yeah, me too.
[01:27:34.800 --> 01:27:35.800]   Act.
[01:27:35.800 --> 01:27:42.720]   Zuckerberg never met a decision where he didn't want to take the route that made the most money
[01:27:42.720 --> 01:27:47.320]   for Facebook without thinking about the implication.
[01:27:47.320 --> 01:27:49.320]   He's well aware of the consequences.
[01:27:49.320 --> 01:27:50.320]   100%.
[01:27:50.320 --> 01:27:53.800]   I mean, you cannot be that good at building a business and recruiting that level of talent
[01:27:53.800 --> 01:27:54.800]   without being aware.
[01:27:54.800 --> 01:27:58.880]   And they specifically said their credo has been move fast break things.
[01:27:58.880 --> 01:28:02.720]   So if you look at, we've talked about it here before, but in every instance where they
[01:28:02.720 --> 01:28:09.040]   could take out friction that is necessary to maintain quality, they would remove the
[01:28:09.040 --> 01:28:10.040]   friction.
[01:28:10.040 --> 01:28:16.880]   So reviewing ads and checking that people buying with rubles or not running racist ads
[01:28:16.880 --> 01:28:18.720]   is something they could have easily done.
[01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:21.440]   They have no desire to review ads.
[01:28:21.440 --> 01:28:24.720]   Now that they've been caught, now they're reviewing ads with groups.
[01:28:24.720 --> 01:28:27.920]   How many groups are you a member of that you didn't sign up for on Facebook?
[01:28:27.920 --> 01:28:28.920]   I don't know.
[01:28:28.920 --> 01:28:30.320]   I actually deactivated my account.
[01:28:30.320 --> 01:28:31.320]   Exactly.
[01:28:31.320 --> 01:28:33.000]   So if you go, you can.
[01:28:33.000 --> 01:28:34.000]   Is that what happens?
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:35.000]   So you could sign up for groups.
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:36.000]   You didn't want to be.
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:37.000]   Yeah.
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:38.160]   So the sign you up to groups.
[01:28:38.160 --> 01:28:40.840]   No, no, your friends can sign you up to different groups.
[01:28:40.840 --> 01:28:42.400]   Your friends can do it.
[01:28:42.400 --> 01:28:43.400]   Yeah.
[01:28:43.400 --> 01:28:44.400]   So friends, unquote.
[01:28:44.400 --> 01:28:45.400]   Your friends.
[01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:46.400]   I didn't know that.
[01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:47.400]   Yeah.
[01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:48.400]   Yeah.
[01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:49.400]   So like literally what you could do is.
[01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:52.240]   Doesn't that muddy the signal because I'm not getting that's a valuable signal.
[01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:54.880]   The groups I joined the things I like, that's a signal about me.
[01:28:54.880 --> 01:28:56.680]   Why would they let somebody else modify that?
[01:28:56.680 --> 01:29:01.000]   Because once you're in the group, that may be that may happen in 10% of the cases, but
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:02.440]   in the other 90% it's accurate.
[01:29:02.440 --> 01:29:06.720]   So some mom starts a mom's group or dad started dad group and they add all their
[01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:07.720]   dad friends.
[01:29:07.720 --> 01:29:09.680]   It's going to be accurate most of the time.
[01:29:09.680 --> 01:29:11.320]   And then all of a sudden you're like, well, I didn't join this dad group.
[01:29:11.320 --> 01:29:12.320]   But okay, it's pretty dope.
[01:29:12.320 --> 01:29:17.680]   So you're you both believe that Mark Zuckerberg understands the law, the implications of this
[01:29:17.680 --> 01:29:20.320]   and is not in any way interested.
[01:29:20.320 --> 01:29:26.120]   I believe I believe that the culture of Facebook is is more than most other companies heavily
[01:29:26.120 --> 01:29:29.080]   influenced by Mark Zuckerberg's own perspective.
[01:29:29.080 --> 01:29:33.800]   And I believe this is just my belief that Mark Zuckerberg is completely amoral.
[01:29:33.800 --> 01:29:34.800]   Correct.
[01:29:34.800 --> 01:29:38.880]   He sees what he sees instead of morality, he says, can we get away with this?
[01:29:38.880 --> 01:29:39.880]   Will we be?
[01:29:39.880 --> 01:29:40.880]   Will we get?
[01:29:40.880 --> 01:29:41.880]   We don't get complaints.
[01:29:41.880 --> 01:29:43.320]   Then it's it's the right thing to do.
[01:29:43.320 --> 01:29:47.480]   If we get complaints, we'll apologize and there's certainly a track record of that because
[01:29:47.480 --> 01:29:50.920]   it's a lot of the people that always do stuff and then apologize later.
[01:29:50.920 --> 01:29:51.920]   Exactly.
[01:29:51.920 --> 01:29:52.920]   It's just a good transition.
[01:29:52.920 --> 01:29:54.280]   He's learned Chinese.
[01:29:54.280 --> 01:29:58.360]   He's begged the Chinese government to allow him in there knowing full well that one of
[01:29:58.360 --> 01:30:02.560]   the rules of the road for going into China would be you have to turn over dissonance,
[01:30:02.560 --> 01:30:04.160]   journalists, et cetera.
[01:30:04.160 --> 01:30:10.880]   Sergey Brin also had the opportunity to bring Google into China a decade ago and he said,
[01:30:10.880 --> 01:30:12.400]   no, we're going to get everything outside.
[01:30:12.400 --> 01:30:13.400]   It's not worth it for us.
[01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:14.400]   We're not going to give it up.
[01:30:14.400 --> 01:30:17.160]   So you can just look at the character of Sergey Brin versus Zuckerberg.
[01:30:17.160 --> 01:30:20.560]   You know, and I think this is where I really kind of blame Apple a little bit.
[01:30:20.560 --> 01:30:23.640]   I think it's important for American companies at some point to take a stand and say we are
[01:30:23.640 --> 01:30:27.960]   not going to support authoritarian regimes with our technology because ultimately it
[01:30:27.960 --> 01:30:30.160]   will be used against the people in those regimes.
[01:30:30.160 --> 01:30:31.760]   Yeah, you're going to have to.
[01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:34.600]   I think Apple needs to do that too and Apple's not doing that.
[01:30:34.600 --> 01:30:37.960]   But they have not compromised their security on the phones in China.
[01:30:37.960 --> 01:30:38.960]   Right.
[01:30:38.960 --> 01:30:41.600]   So, but if you're in China, guess who stores your content?
[01:30:41.600 --> 01:30:42.600]   Yeah.
[01:30:42.600 --> 01:30:46.160]   Your iCloud content is stored by Chinese companies owned by the Chinese government.
[01:30:46.160 --> 01:30:47.160]   In many cases.
[01:30:47.160 --> 01:30:48.280]   No, like, I don't know what they is.
[01:30:48.280 --> 01:30:50.320]   Is it that the case with the iCloud?
[01:30:50.320 --> 01:30:52.440]   So it's going to be a very difficult.
[01:30:52.440 --> 01:30:54.440]   Apple needs to say no.
[01:30:54.440 --> 01:30:55.680]   Apple has to say no.
[01:30:55.680 --> 01:31:00.680]   What they've been doing is saying, well, you know, okay, but we're going to make it encrypted,
[01:31:00.680 --> 01:31:02.560]   except iCloud is not encrypted.
[01:31:02.560 --> 01:31:03.560]   Yeah.
[01:31:03.560 --> 01:31:04.560]   So.
[01:31:04.560 --> 01:31:06.400]   Yeah, they're dancing the line probably.
[01:31:06.400 --> 01:31:13.880]   You cannot work with President Xi and expect in the long run not to have to play those
[01:31:13.880 --> 01:31:14.880]   games.
[01:31:14.880 --> 01:31:18.240]   And a lot of people will say, oh, these companies have to follow the laws in the company in the
[01:31:18.240 --> 01:31:19.840]   countries where they're doing business.
[01:31:19.840 --> 01:31:20.840]   Yeah.
[01:31:20.840 --> 01:31:21.840]   What I say, we're just following orders.
[01:31:21.840 --> 01:31:25.640]   What I say is that Apple and Facebook don't have to make trillions and trillions and trillions
[01:31:25.640 --> 01:31:26.640]   and trillions of dollars.
[01:31:26.640 --> 01:31:27.640]   They don't have to do that.
[01:31:27.640 --> 01:31:30.720]   And just because they're doing it for the money doesn't make it righter.
[01:31:30.720 --> 01:31:31.720]   Yeah.
[01:31:31.720 --> 01:31:32.720]   You know what I'm saying?
[01:31:32.720 --> 01:31:33.720]   Exactly.
[01:31:33.720 --> 01:31:35.320]   It's like, you know, Facebook is way too big.
[01:31:35.320 --> 01:31:37.440]   They make way too much money as it is now.
[01:31:37.440 --> 01:31:44.040]   I have no interest in excusing Facebook's behavior by saying, oh, well, you know, that's
[01:31:44.040 --> 01:31:46.240]   they have to do that because that's the way you do XYZ.
[01:31:46.240 --> 01:31:48.640]   You know, you don't have to do XY or Z.
[01:31:48.640 --> 01:31:51.080]   You can you can be a somewhat ethical company and still.
[01:31:51.080 --> 01:31:54.360]   Well, and also he has super control of that company is super voting share.
[01:31:54.360 --> 01:31:57.720]   So unlike the old days where he could get ousted, he can't be ousted.
[01:31:57.720 --> 01:32:00.280]   So he could actually even take a more principled stand.
[01:32:00.280 --> 01:32:05.760]   So because of the super founder design and the architecture of these companies now, someone
[01:32:05.760 --> 01:32:06.760]   likes Sergey Brinci's.
[01:32:06.760 --> 01:32:07.760]   Yeah, we're not going to go to China.
[01:32:07.760 --> 01:32:09.880]   If you don't like that, don't buy our stock.
[01:32:09.880 --> 01:32:10.880]   Right.
[01:32:10.880 --> 01:32:13.920]   You know, and if you don't Facebook, it's a we're just we're not going to operate in China.
[01:32:13.920 --> 01:32:17.720]   We don't believe in, you know, handing people over to the government to be tortured.
[01:32:17.720 --> 01:32:18.720]   That's it.
[01:32:18.720 --> 01:32:19.720]   Right.
[01:32:19.720 --> 01:32:21.960]   Well, I have to say I'm I agree with you.
[01:32:21.960 --> 01:32:26.200]   I'm thrilled to hear you say that, but I I'm surprised a little bit because as I mean,
[01:32:26.200 --> 01:32:27.200]   you're obviously a capitalist.
[01:32:27.200 --> 01:32:29.080]   I'm a capitalist, but I believe in human rights.
[01:32:29.080 --> 01:32:32.480]   I don't think these two things, you know, cannot coexist.
[01:32:32.480 --> 01:32:38.680]   You know, we if you look at our democracy, capitalism and democracy have not always gone
[01:32:38.680 --> 01:32:42.280]   together, but they have done a wonderful job in our country.
[01:32:42.280 --> 01:32:48.440]   And if you look at other countries like China, they have this quasi capitalism crooked capitalism
[01:32:48.440 --> 01:32:53.520]   that's going on with, you know, authoritarian authoritarian control.
[01:32:53.520 --> 01:32:55.360]   And we have to say that's not the best model.
[01:32:55.360 --> 01:33:01.000]   And this is why it's very important for us to have leadership that and to aspire to be
[01:33:01.000 --> 01:33:07.360]   honest, you know, really high quality, moral and ethical leaders.
[01:33:07.360 --> 01:33:11.240]   That's why I was so upset by when we tortured people after 9/11, where we put people in
[01:33:11.240 --> 01:33:15.560]   Guantanamo and wouldn't give them a trial because that gives evidence to other countries
[01:33:15.560 --> 01:33:17.360]   that, Hey, maybe it's okay.
[01:33:17.360 --> 01:33:19.480]   Like democracy, like, yeah, they're hypocritical.
[01:33:19.480 --> 01:33:20.480]   They have the death penalty.
[01:33:20.480 --> 01:33:23.440]   They have Guantanamo and they waterboard people.
[01:33:23.440 --> 01:33:26.000]   We have to maintain a very high standard in terms of human rights.
[01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:31.080]   So we can be an example, obviously that hasn't worked out so well in the last couple of years.
[01:33:31.080 --> 01:33:33.480]   I'll said, Wow, you got deep.
[01:33:33.480 --> 01:33:38.840]   Well, you know, and I think you probably have more insight into what's going on inside
[01:33:38.840 --> 01:33:41.920]   Facebook than I do, certainly, but it's all top down.
[01:33:41.920 --> 01:33:46.080]   Yeah, they're all Clinton supporters, by the way, like they were all donating to Clinton,
[01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:50.320]   but the only person on the Facebook team who was allowed to ever publicly say they were
[01:33:50.320 --> 01:33:51.880]   for a candidate was Peter Thiel.
[01:33:51.880 --> 01:33:52.880]   Yeah.
[01:33:52.880 --> 01:33:57.680]   Imagine if Sheryl Sandberg or Zuckerberg showed up for Hillary Clinton and spoke at the convention.
[01:33:57.680 --> 01:33:58.680]   Right.
[01:33:58.680 --> 01:33:59.680]   They didn't.
[01:33:59.680 --> 01:34:00.680]   Neither of them did.
[01:34:00.680 --> 01:34:01.680]   Yeah.
[01:34:01.680 --> 01:34:02.680]   But you can be sure they were hosting fundraisers.
[01:34:02.680 --> 01:34:03.680]   Yeah, but Teal did it.
[01:34:03.680 --> 01:34:04.680]   Teal did it.
[01:34:04.680 --> 01:34:05.680]   The.
[01:34:05.680 --> 01:34:06.680]   Yeah, I'm going to go there.
[01:34:06.680 --> 01:34:07.680]   I'm going to tell everybody my opinion, but they can't.
[01:34:07.680 --> 01:34:08.680]   Why?
[01:34:08.680 --> 01:34:10.680]   Well, I think the reason they didn't, the executives there didn't publicly support Hillary.
[01:34:10.680 --> 01:34:11.680]   They're playing both sides.
[01:34:11.680 --> 01:34:12.680]   Was they were playing both sides?
[01:34:12.680 --> 01:34:15.600]   But Peter Thiel's like, I have my side, but doesn't every businessman play both sides?
[01:34:15.600 --> 01:34:16.880]   I mean, that's always the argument.
[01:34:16.880 --> 01:34:17.880]   That's why they shouldn't.
[01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:21.360]   I mean, Elon Musk said, I'm going to put my foot down about global warming and I'm
[01:34:21.360 --> 01:34:24.280]   going to get $38,000 to the Republican National Committee.
[01:34:24.280 --> 01:34:26.000]   Yeah, that was weird too.
[01:34:26.000 --> 01:34:29.240]   Well, I mean, I understand you're doing your practice.
[01:34:29.240 --> 01:34:32.840]   Well, I said that that was because every executive, why they play both sides.
[01:34:32.840 --> 01:34:33.840]   Yeah.
[01:34:33.840 --> 01:34:38.960]   But I think in terms of like global warming, he left when Trump left the Paris Quays that
[01:34:38.960 --> 01:34:39.960]   you don't, I'm out.
[01:34:39.960 --> 01:34:40.960]   Yeah.
[01:34:40.960 --> 01:34:43.200]   So it's one thing to give like these minor donations, three or four grand or whatever it
[01:34:43.200 --> 01:34:51.120]   is, like I think the, you know, supporting an administration that doesn't believe in
[01:34:51.120 --> 01:34:52.520]   climate is a little bit of.
[01:34:52.520 --> 01:34:53.520]   Yeah, that's pretty hard.
[01:34:53.520 --> 01:34:54.520]   Which too far.
[01:34:54.520 --> 01:34:55.520]   Yeah.
[01:34:55.520 --> 01:34:56.520]   You know, for me at least.
[01:34:56.520 --> 01:34:57.520]   Yeah.
[01:34:57.520 --> 01:34:59.480]   Wasn't the Republican National Committee was a Republican pack.
[01:34:59.480 --> 01:35:02.160]   The irony is that buying the government is not that expensive.
[01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:06.240]   I am always flabbergasted by how little it takes.
[01:35:06.240 --> 01:35:07.240]   Yeah.
[01:35:07.240 --> 01:35:08.240]   It's unbelievable.
[01:35:08.240 --> 01:35:13.160]   You see senators and Congress people selling out the US government and you're finding
[01:35:13.160 --> 01:35:15.120]   out how much money they made for that essentially.
[01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:17.480]   It was like, you know, $10,000 or something like that.
[01:35:17.480 --> 01:35:20.200]   I don't donate to politicians at all.
[01:35:20.200 --> 01:35:21.600]   I just find the whole thing kind of weird.
[01:35:21.600 --> 01:35:26.760]   But one time I did and I was at some dinner and high profile New York politician came
[01:35:26.760 --> 01:35:29.800]   up to me and he was like, I really want to know what your issues are so I can support
[01:35:29.800 --> 01:35:30.800]   them.
[01:35:30.800 --> 01:35:33.200]   And I was like, what if my issues, you don't agree with them?
[01:35:33.200 --> 01:35:37.320]   He's like, well, of course, you know, I was like, I'm the biggest, the craziest thing
[01:35:37.320 --> 01:35:38.320]   I've ever heard.
[01:35:38.320 --> 01:35:39.320]   Right.
[01:35:39.320 --> 01:35:40.480]   Like, it's like, why do you like this issue?
[01:35:40.480 --> 01:35:41.480]   Oh, I have integrity.
[01:35:41.480 --> 01:35:42.480]   Yeah.
[01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:43.480]   Look, I want them to know.
[01:35:43.480 --> 01:35:45.640]   But this is what politicians do.
[01:35:45.640 --> 01:35:48.120]   They want every, they want to make every everybody.
[01:35:48.120 --> 01:35:50.560]   A group believe that they're working for them.
[01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:51.560]   Yeah.
[01:35:51.560 --> 01:35:52.560]   And they all lie.
[01:35:52.560 --> 01:35:54.120]   It's just how they do it.
[01:35:54.120 --> 01:35:55.120]   Let's take a little break.
[01:35:55.120 --> 01:36:00.680]   And when we come back more with our peerless panel, like Elgin from Elgin.com and guest.
[01:36:00.680 --> 01:36:02.480]   Or know my dot net.
[01:36:02.480 --> 01:36:07.180]   Jason Kallick, and as author of the books, Angel, Angel, he's an angel.
[01:36:07.180 --> 01:36:09.620]   Oh, oh, on inside.com.
[01:36:09.620 --> 01:36:11.100]   See, oh, and there it is.
[01:36:11.100 --> 01:36:14.980]   Well, just appearing now in a clinic, Japan, yeah.
[01:36:14.980 --> 01:36:19.920]   So the sky and apparently a number one best seller in Japan already crazy and a mere
[01:36:19.920 --> 01:36:22.500]   19 hundred and 44 yen.
[01:36:22.500 --> 01:36:23.500]   I don't know what that is.
[01:36:23.500 --> 01:36:24.500]   I said about $18,000.
[01:36:24.500 --> 01:36:25.500]   No, no, it's about a penny.
[01:36:25.500 --> 01:36:26.500]   It's like 40, 95.
[01:36:26.500 --> 01:36:27.500]   Yeah, it's good.
[01:36:27.500 --> 01:36:30.420]   I'm my mind is blown when I see that cover.
[01:36:30.420 --> 01:36:31.420]   I'm like, isn't that awesome?
[01:36:31.420 --> 01:36:33.700]   I'm like, I'm like, I'm like, I'm doing it in seven other languages.
[01:36:33.700 --> 01:36:34.700]   It's pretty dope.
[01:36:34.700 --> 01:36:38.540]   I have a, I think a Russian version of one of my books.
[01:36:38.540 --> 01:36:39.540]   It's pretty.
[01:36:39.540 --> 01:36:41.660]   I'm going to go the third week in September.
[01:36:41.660 --> 01:36:44.100]   I'm going to go to Tokyo and do a couple of speaking games.
[01:36:44.100 --> 01:36:45.100]   You will be, I think, mobbed.
[01:36:45.100 --> 01:36:46.100]   I can't win.
[01:36:46.100 --> 01:36:47.620]   Yeah, it's going to be great.
[01:36:47.620 --> 01:36:49.460]   And there, but what's great is they're very polite.
[01:36:49.460 --> 01:36:50.460]   Yes.
[01:36:50.460 --> 01:36:51.460]   They mob you polite.
[01:36:51.460 --> 01:36:52.460]   They might have you polite.
[01:36:52.460 --> 01:36:54.460]   I just want to go and eat a ton of food.
[01:36:54.460 --> 01:36:55.460]   It's so good.
[01:36:55.460 --> 01:36:58.180]   I just want to eat a tai-pora and sushi and beef bowls.
[01:36:58.180 --> 01:36:59.180]   I want to, I want it all.
[01:36:59.180 --> 01:37:00.180]   Yeah.
[01:37:00.180 --> 01:37:01.180]   Coffee tea.
[01:37:01.180 --> 01:37:03.900]   If you get to a soccer, you got to have the Kobe beef, the wagyu beef is so incredible
[01:37:03.900 --> 01:37:04.900]   down there.
[01:37:04.900 --> 01:37:05.900]   Oh, so good.
[01:37:05.900 --> 01:37:07.460]   Ladies and gentlemen, we had a fun week on Twitter.
[01:37:07.460 --> 01:37:09.420]   We had some interesting guests in house.
[01:37:09.420 --> 01:37:14.020]   I maybe I'll show you a little bit of what you might have missed if you missed anything.
[01:37:14.020 --> 01:37:15.820]   Previously on Twitter.
[01:37:15.820 --> 01:37:19.180]   I assigned post to this German bakery.
[01:37:19.180 --> 01:37:20.180]   Yeah.
[01:37:20.180 --> 01:37:25.780]   A dozen shoots, Thruund Ferrodnung, a data protection basic right, Akhtung.
[01:37:25.780 --> 01:37:31.820]   In our bakery, we are likely to recognize you by name and your favorite baked good.
[01:37:31.820 --> 01:37:37.380]   If you do not want this, shout as soon as you enter, I do not agree.
[01:37:37.380 --> 01:37:42.660]   And we will try our best to not know you.
[01:37:42.660 --> 01:37:43.980]   iOS today.
[01:37:43.980 --> 01:37:50.140]   We got an email actually from a viewer who said, I want to know what's in Leo's bag.
[01:37:50.140 --> 01:37:53.340]   Before we leave, Lisa and I have a little negotiation.
[01:37:53.340 --> 01:37:54.900]   How many devices are you bringing?
[01:37:54.900 --> 01:37:56.580]   Are you bringing chargers and cables?
[01:37:56.580 --> 01:37:58.620]   Or do you expect me to bring them?
[01:37:58.620 --> 01:38:02.140]   We also negotiate who carries a toothpaste and who carries a deodorant.
[01:38:02.140 --> 01:38:03.640]   We share.
[01:38:03.640 --> 01:38:06.060]   I carry these in case anybody wants an autograph.
[01:38:06.060 --> 01:38:09.700]   So far, I've had these for several years.
[01:38:09.700 --> 01:38:11.740]   The new screen savers.
[01:38:11.740 --> 01:38:13.660]   This is the Tiki Tron.
[01:38:13.660 --> 01:38:18.300]   The world's only robot that serves Tiki cocktails.
[01:38:18.300 --> 01:38:22.740]   Now, you told me we have to make a, Dr. Bobby, we have to make a sacrifice before we do this.
[01:38:22.740 --> 01:38:23.740]   Yes.
[01:38:23.740 --> 01:38:25.220]   Each idol represents a different drink.
[01:38:25.220 --> 01:38:26.660]   In this case, it's the Mai Tai.
[01:38:26.660 --> 01:38:28.460]   The drink of the gods.
[01:38:28.460 --> 01:38:30.460]   The elixir of the gods.
[01:38:30.460 --> 01:38:32.220]   And I drop in the seahorse.
[01:38:32.220 --> 01:38:33.220]   And everyone dances.
[01:38:33.220 --> 01:38:34.220]   Awesome.
[01:38:34.220 --> 01:38:37.540]   That's perfect.
[01:38:37.540 --> 01:38:40.340]   It's the perfect Mai Tai.
[01:38:40.340 --> 01:38:41.340]   To it.
[01:38:41.340 --> 01:38:44.860]   It keeps going and going and going.
[01:38:44.860 --> 01:38:48.420]   Does it seem like those drinks are getting strong?
[01:38:48.420 --> 01:38:49.420]   I don't know.
[01:38:49.420 --> 01:38:51.620]   Sometimes those meals are smoking right now.
[01:38:51.620 --> 01:38:54.340]   There's things going on here.
[01:38:54.340 --> 01:38:55.820]   You're not even.
[01:38:55.820 --> 01:38:57.780]   Very refreshing.
[01:38:57.780 --> 01:39:00.340]   It's just a good drink.
[01:39:00.340 --> 01:39:02.460]   Very, very refreshing.
[01:39:02.460 --> 01:39:07.540]   Our show today, that was Jason Howell, all about Android Tech News Weekly.
[01:39:07.540 --> 01:39:08.540]   Great guy.
[01:39:08.540 --> 01:39:10.940]   He was our co-host this week on the new screen savers.
[01:39:10.940 --> 01:39:12.380]   We can get you back for the new screen savers.
[01:39:12.380 --> 01:39:13.380]   I would love to.
[01:39:13.380 --> 01:39:14.380]   You sure?
[01:39:14.380 --> 01:39:15.380]   Saturday is right.
[01:39:15.380 --> 01:39:16.380]   Yeah.
[01:39:16.380 --> 01:39:17.380]   And Mike, have you done it?
[01:39:17.380 --> 01:39:18.380]   Have you?
[01:39:18.380 --> 01:39:19.380]   I've done it a couple of times.
[01:39:19.380 --> 01:39:20.380]   Yeah.
[01:39:20.380 --> 01:39:21.940]   We didn't have Tiki drinks, but I can always be arranged.
[01:39:21.940 --> 01:39:23.980]   I think we should do the technology of wine making it.
[01:39:23.980 --> 01:39:24.980]   We should do.
[01:39:24.980 --> 01:39:25.980]   We should do.
[01:39:25.980 --> 01:39:26.980]   That would fascinate.
[01:39:26.980 --> 01:39:27.980]   Great.
[01:39:27.980 --> 01:39:28.980]   Yeah.
[01:39:28.980 --> 01:39:30.820]   They may have like a robotic foot for pressing the grapes.
[01:39:30.820 --> 01:39:33.220]   All sorts of stuff they could be in there.
[01:39:33.220 --> 01:39:35.100]   Our show today brought to you by Moog Soft.
[01:39:35.100 --> 01:39:39.620]   If you are the IT person who gets the alerts, who gets the tickets, you don't have to
[01:39:39.620 --> 01:39:40.620]   tell you.
[01:39:40.620 --> 01:39:41.620]   It's nuts, right?
[01:39:41.620 --> 01:39:42.620]   It's crazy.
[01:39:42.620 --> 01:39:46.100]   And a lot of those alerts that come in are meaningless.
[01:39:46.100 --> 01:39:50.340]   They're the cascade effect from the causal error.
[01:39:50.340 --> 01:39:55.060]   And then you have to kind of go, "Well, okay, and dig through that and find the real problem
[01:39:55.060 --> 01:39:56.420]   so you can fix it."
[01:39:56.420 --> 01:39:59.420]   You need Moog Soft AI ops.
[01:39:59.420 --> 01:40:04.900]   Artificial intelligence for IT operations reduces those IT alerts and tickets by up to
[01:40:04.900 --> 01:40:06.940]   90%.
[01:40:06.940 --> 01:40:12.900]   Turns that pinball machine that you're in, ting, jing, jing, jing, into a Zen Garden.
[01:40:12.900 --> 01:40:15.980]   All you get is actionable work items.
[01:40:15.980 --> 01:40:17.780]   They call them situations.
[01:40:17.780 --> 01:40:18.780]   So they cluster the events.
[01:40:18.780 --> 01:40:19.940]   And they do this by the way.
[01:40:19.940 --> 01:40:21.420]   You don't have to teach it anything.
[01:40:21.420 --> 01:40:23.460]   No rules, no filters, no models.
[01:40:23.460 --> 01:40:24.620]   It learns.
[01:40:24.620 --> 01:40:26.620]   It's already learned a lot from previous users.
[01:40:26.620 --> 01:40:28.580]   And then we'll learn more from your situation.
[01:40:28.580 --> 01:40:31.940]   So they can say, "Oh yeah, when all those things happen, it's because this is going on."
[01:40:31.940 --> 01:40:33.380]   So you get a situation.
[01:40:33.380 --> 01:40:36.980]   All the events are clustered, clustered into a situation.
[01:40:36.980 --> 01:40:40.220]   And then you solve that problem.
[01:40:40.220 --> 01:40:41.500]   And you are a hero.
[01:40:41.500 --> 01:40:43.220]   Moog Soft AI ops has your back.
[01:40:43.220 --> 01:40:44.220]   Because I need to replace you.
[01:40:44.220 --> 01:40:48.620]   It was created by IT professionals to make them support heroes.
[01:40:48.620 --> 01:40:51.580]   Heroes in the business, you want this.
[01:40:51.580 --> 01:40:58.520]   Now, if you're a CIO or a CTO, trust me, you don't get those alerts, but you're IT
[01:40:58.520 --> 01:40:59.520]   team will thank you.
[01:40:59.520 --> 01:41:02.260]   And they will be more effective, a lot more effective.
[01:41:02.260 --> 01:41:06.340]   HCL Technologies is a global IT managed service provider.
[01:41:06.340 --> 01:41:09.180]   They put Moog Soft AI ops into their dry ice platform.
[01:41:09.180 --> 01:41:11.300]   It's an amazing, dry ice platform.
[01:41:11.300 --> 01:41:13.620]   It's amazing for managed service providers.
[01:41:13.620 --> 01:41:16.620]   It's the event management layer in there.
[01:41:16.620 --> 01:41:19.380]   It's helped their clients streamline operational workflows.
[01:41:19.380 --> 01:41:23.940]   They've actually reduced the time that takes the detect to correct lifecycle of incident
[01:41:23.940 --> 01:41:29.240]   tickets by a huge amount, 33% reduction in the mean time to restore.
[01:41:29.240 --> 01:41:32.040]   That means you're going to get that server back up and running.
[01:41:32.040 --> 01:41:36.760]   You're going to solve that problem 33% faster, which means you can support more customers
[01:41:36.760 --> 01:41:40.280]   with high quality service and you can keep the operational costs low.
[01:41:40.280 --> 01:41:44.160]   The efficiency up, this is a win for everybody.
[01:41:44.160 --> 01:41:48.200]   With Moog Soft AI ops, you can reduce your IT alerts and tickets by up to 90%.
[01:41:48.200 --> 01:41:51.360]   Guaranteed, be more effective, be more efficient.
[01:41:51.360 --> 01:41:52.360]   You got to check it out.
[01:41:52.360 --> 01:41:53.920]   You get a demo at the website.
[01:41:53.920 --> 01:41:59.020]   Moog Soft, M-O-O-G-S-O-F-T, MoogSoft.com.
[01:41:59.020 --> 01:42:00.020]   Check it out.
[01:42:00.020 --> 01:42:03.820]   Add it to your tools and relax.
[01:42:03.820 --> 01:42:08.220]   They're not trying to take your job, they're trying to make your job in your life better.
[01:42:08.220 --> 01:42:09.260]   MoogSoft.com.
[01:42:09.260 --> 01:42:16.260]   We use HipChat, as you know.
[01:42:16.260 --> 01:42:17.260]   Me too.
[01:42:17.260 --> 01:42:18.260]   Yeah.
[01:42:18.260 --> 01:42:19.260]   Sold.
[01:42:19.260 --> 01:42:20.260]   Sold.
[01:42:20.260 --> 01:42:21.260]   You used to use.
[01:42:21.260 --> 01:42:22.260]   I know.
[01:42:22.260 --> 01:42:24.740]   Who's bigger at last year's Slack?
[01:42:24.740 --> 01:42:26.460]   Slack is bigger, for sure.
[01:42:26.460 --> 01:42:28.620]   They're making more money and they're growing faster.
[01:42:28.620 --> 01:42:30.820]   Atlassian has a bunch of different businesses.
[01:42:30.820 --> 01:42:33.380]   They're worth maybe $2 billion in the stock market.
[01:42:33.380 --> 01:42:38.500]   Right now, Slack is probably worth $8 billion.
[01:42:38.500 --> 01:42:41.860]   If they got just...
[01:42:41.860 --> 01:42:44.980]   Maybe the HipChat business is 10% of Atlassian, be $200 million.
[01:42:44.980 --> 01:42:49.420]   They were to get even one or two or three percent of Slack.
[01:42:49.420 --> 01:42:53.420]   For this, this would be Slack blocks a potential competitor acquirer.
[01:42:53.420 --> 01:42:55.860]   They get all those users and they defend against Microsoft.
[01:42:55.860 --> 01:42:57.460]   You could see somebody like...
[01:42:57.460 --> 01:42:59.100]   Well, Microsoft's got Teams, which is...
[01:42:59.100 --> 01:43:00.100]   They're giving away...
[01:43:00.100 --> 01:43:01.100]   Because they just made free, yeah.
[01:43:01.100 --> 01:43:03.060]   Teams are 300 or less.
[01:43:03.060 --> 01:43:04.060]   It's not as good.
[01:43:04.060 --> 01:43:07.140]   We've been looking because we have to solve this question about, "Okay, where do we go
[01:43:07.140 --> 01:43:08.140]   now?"
[01:43:08.140 --> 01:43:09.140]   But I think if you were...
[01:43:09.140 --> 01:43:11.940]   I bet you Google was hot on the heels of HipChat.
[01:43:11.940 --> 01:43:15.860]   Because if you're Google, this is something you lack.
[01:43:15.860 --> 01:43:20.060]   I think Amazon is going to be the one who winds up buying a Slack.
[01:43:20.060 --> 01:43:23.180]   Then they start going into that corporate and they make it part of the Amazon website.
[01:43:23.180 --> 01:43:26.100]   AWS is the biggest of the bunch as terms of this...
[01:43:26.100 --> 01:43:30.540]   For cloud computing, but this is obviously consumer enterprise as the new category of
[01:43:30.540 --> 01:43:35.100]   things that work bottom up inside an enterprise.
[01:43:35.100 --> 01:43:39.420]   I could just see Amazon being willing to jump the fence and pay a large number for this.
[01:43:39.420 --> 01:43:40.420]   Interesting.
[01:43:40.420 --> 01:43:41.420]   Interesting.
[01:43:41.420 --> 01:43:45.300]   I could see Google building it and including it in Google Docs.
[01:43:45.300 --> 01:43:47.060]   They don't have anything like that for Docs.
[01:43:47.060 --> 01:43:48.220]   They could easily add it.
[01:43:48.220 --> 01:43:49.220]   They've hangouts.
[01:43:49.220 --> 01:43:50.220]   That's terrible.
[01:43:50.220 --> 01:43:51.220]   That's...
[01:43:51.220 --> 01:43:52.220]   Yeah, hangouts are good for...
[01:43:52.220 --> 01:43:55.820]   I know a lot of developer teams love that hangouts product for when they do their standup calls
[01:43:55.820 --> 01:43:56.820]   and video calls.
[01:43:56.820 --> 01:44:00.100]   They're addicted to it, but it's not good for persistent chat.
[01:44:00.100 --> 01:44:03.700]   But that's the key with Slack and with HipChat is you can go back in time.
[01:44:03.700 --> 01:44:05.860]   You can see everything you ever said, everything...
[01:44:05.860 --> 01:44:06.860]   API integration.
[01:44:06.860 --> 01:44:07.860]   Great.
[01:44:07.860 --> 01:44:08.860]   Yeah.
[01:44:08.860 --> 01:44:09.860]   For us, that's the big deal.
[01:44:09.860 --> 01:44:10.860]   That's where Teams falls flat.
[01:44:10.860 --> 01:44:13.940]   I asked our team, "Well, okay, if we're going to move, we could move to Teams for free."
[01:44:13.940 --> 01:44:14.940]   Yeah.
[01:44:14.940 --> 01:44:15.940]   Because Slack is not cheap.
[01:44:15.940 --> 01:44:16.940]   We could move to Teams.
[01:44:16.940 --> 01:44:17.940]   $7 a person per month?
[01:44:17.940 --> 01:44:18.940]   Yeah.
[01:44:18.940 --> 01:44:19.940]   Well, to me, that's not cheap.
[01:44:19.940 --> 01:44:20.940]   No, I know.
[01:44:20.940 --> 01:44:21.940]   If you have 20 people all of a sudden, you're paying a couple thousand a year.
[01:44:21.940 --> 01:44:23.460]   You got to think about this.
[01:44:23.460 --> 01:44:24.900]   And then you have a free tier.
[01:44:24.900 --> 01:44:27.820]   So I said, "Do you use integrations and they gave me..."
[01:44:27.820 --> 01:44:28.820]   Yeah.
[01:44:28.820 --> 01:44:29.820]   Oh, yeah.
[01:44:29.820 --> 01:44:30.820]   We got Jira.
[01:44:30.820 --> 01:44:31.820]   We've got Confluence.
[01:44:31.820 --> 01:44:32.980]   We have a bunch of things we integrate in.
[01:44:32.980 --> 01:44:34.220]   And Teams doesn't do that.
[01:44:34.220 --> 01:44:35.220]   Not yet.
[01:44:35.220 --> 01:44:36.220]   They need to get Zappier.
[01:44:36.220 --> 01:44:37.220]   Zappier.
[01:44:37.220 --> 01:44:38.220]   I like Zappier a lot.
[01:44:38.220 --> 01:44:41.980]   If this then that, if I don't know if they support Microsoft Teams yet when they do that
[01:44:41.980 --> 01:44:42.980]   they're going to support on a lot.
[01:44:42.980 --> 01:44:44.700]   Yeah, because you could just integrate that way.
[01:44:44.700 --> 01:44:45.700]   Just integrate that way.
[01:44:45.700 --> 01:44:46.700]   But it really is a problem.
[01:44:46.700 --> 01:44:52.780]   It is the defensibility of Slack is predicated on all these edge cases where people will
[01:44:52.780 --> 01:44:53.780]   make other products.
[01:44:53.780 --> 01:44:55.180]   It just works with everything you already use.
[01:44:55.180 --> 01:44:56.500]   They've got a great API.
[01:44:56.500 --> 01:44:58.580]   It's very easy to write Slack bots.
[01:44:58.580 --> 01:44:59.580]   Yeah.
[01:44:59.580 --> 01:45:01.580]   So anyway, Slack acquired...
[01:45:01.580 --> 01:45:02.580]   Big win.
[01:45:02.580 --> 01:45:03.580]   HipChat.
[01:45:03.580 --> 01:45:06.140]   It's really like they require the users.
[01:45:06.140 --> 01:45:07.620]   So HipChat is going away.
[01:45:07.620 --> 01:45:08.780]   Yes, they're going to sunset it.
[01:45:08.780 --> 01:45:12.300]   And so it was really a deal, a partnership between the two companies.
[01:45:12.300 --> 01:45:18.020]   Slack is going to use, integrate with some Atlassian services in exchange for this transfer
[01:45:18.020 --> 01:45:19.020]   of users.
[01:45:19.020 --> 01:45:21.180]   Now, how many Slack users are going to keep...
[01:45:21.180 --> 01:45:23.780]   How many HipChat users are going to keep using Slack?
[01:45:23.780 --> 01:45:28.420]   So what we've been looking at, and I'm sure we're a perfect example of what people are
[01:45:28.420 --> 01:45:31.220]   going to do, is how easy is it going to be to move?
[01:45:31.220 --> 01:45:34.500]   And I was hoping and expecting that, well, it would just happen.
[01:45:34.500 --> 01:45:35.500]   You won't have to do anything.
[01:45:35.500 --> 01:45:36.980]   It'll just suddenly be using Slack.
[01:45:36.980 --> 01:45:37.980]   It's not going to be that easy.
[01:45:37.980 --> 01:45:38.980]   We have to export.
[01:45:38.980 --> 01:45:39.980]   We have to import.
[01:45:39.980 --> 01:45:40.980]   They're going to lose some people.
[01:45:40.980 --> 01:45:41.980]   They're going to lose some people.
[01:45:41.980 --> 01:45:42.980]   That's not good.
[01:45:42.980 --> 01:45:47.220]   Now, I imagine they're working as quickly as they can on a transparent switchover.
[01:45:47.220 --> 01:45:50.340]   But that little difficulty gives an opening to Microsoft Teams.
[01:45:50.340 --> 01:45:51.340]   Yes.
[01:45:51.340 --> 01:45:52.420]   Well, that and the price.
[01:45:52.420 --> 01:45:54.020]   One footnote in all this.
[01:45:54.020 --> 01:45:59.100]   I heard somewhere that Microsoft Teams actually has more paid users than Slack.
[01:45:59.100 --> 01:46:00.940]   Slack has three million paid users.
[01:46:00.940 --> 01:46:01.940]   That's right.
[01:46:01.940 --> 01:46:02.940]   Really?
[01:46:02.940 --> 01:46:03.940]   How do they count that?
[01:46:03.940 --> 01:46:07.940]   Is it like all the people who had out looked for something for Teams?
[01:46:07.940 --> 01:46:08.940]   They just don't know.
[01:46:08.940 --> 01:46:09.940]   Teams wasn't free until recently.
[01:46:09.940 --> 01:46:11.220]   They didn't have a free tier.
[01:46:11.220 --> 01:46:16.300]   So basically, 100% of their users until recently were paid users.
[01:46:16.300 --> 01:46:19.380]   Microsoft claims that 200,000 organizations use Teams.
[01:46:19.380 --> 01:46:20.980]   Slack says it has half a million.
[01:46:20.980 --> 01:46:23.700]   Eight million people use the service.
[01:46:23.700 --> 01:46:24.700]   Three million paid.
[01:46:24.700 --> 01:46:25.700]   Yeah.
[01:46:25.700 --> 01:46:27.820]   Well, we don't know is how many people are paying for Teams.
[01:46:27.820 --> 01:46:28.820]   Right.
[01:46:28.820 --> 01:46:30.020]   But some of that is not paying for Teams.
[01:46:30.020 --> 01:46:31.500]   It's part of their Office 365.
[01:46:31.500 --> 01:46:32.500]   Exactly.
[01:46:32.500 --> 01:46:33.500]   It's muddy.
[01:46:33.500 --> 01:46:34.500]   It's embarrassing.
[01:46:34.500 --> 01:46:35.500]   Yeah.
[01:46:35.500 --> 01:46:37.140]   So we're not an Office House.
[01:46:37.140 --> 01:46:39.740]   We're kind of a Google G Suite House.
[01:46:39.740 --> 01:46:40.740]   Give me two.
[01:46:40.740 --> 01:46:44.020]   So that's one of the reasons I thought, well, why didn't Google buy this?
[01:46:44.020 --> 01:46:45.420]   That would have been nice.
[01:46:45.420 --> 01:46:47.420]   Google could really use another communications.
[01:46:47.420 --> 01:46:51.420]   No, they have because they have to say that about Microsoft too.
[01:46:51.420 --> 01:46:52.420]   They got Yammer.
[01:46:52.420 --> 01:46:54.980]   They got Skype and now they have Teams.
[01:46:54.980 --> 01:46:55.980]   Teams is nice.
[01:46:55.980 --> 01:46:57.700]   It looks good.
[01:46:57.700 --> 01:46:58.700]   I asked our team.
[01:46:58.700 --> 01:47:00.540]   I said, look, we wouldn't have to pay for it.
[01:47:00.540 --> 01:47:05.660]   By the way, there are a lot of other kind of smaller open source alternatives.
[01:47:05.660 --> 01:47:07.660]   There's Flock, which is not free.
[01:47:07.660 --> 01:47:08.660]   There's Mattermost.
[01:47:08.660 --> 01:47:09.660]   There's Riots.
[01:47:09.660 --> 01:47:13.820]   What is the difference between Skype and their chat?
[01:47:13.820 --> 01:47:17.100]   Skype had their own Slack chat thing for groups.
[01:47:17.100 --> 01:47:18.100]   Yeah.
[01:47:18.100 --> 01:47:19.100]   It's true.
[01:47:19.100 --> 01:47:20.100]   It's very confusing.
[01:47:20.100 --> 01:47:23.100]   Microsoft's kind of like Google in that regard where they have a number of different solutions.
[01:47:23.100 --> 01:47:24.100]   Yeah.
[01:47:24.100 --> 01:47:25.100]   Yeah.
[01:47:25.100 --> 01:47:26.100]   It's a bring back aim.
[01:47:26.100 --> 01:47:28.340]   In fact, in a way, Slack succeeds because it's so monolithic.
[01:47:28.340 --> 01:47:29.340]   It's Slack.
[01:47:29.340 --> 01:47:30.340]   It's one thing.
[01:47:30.340 --> 01:47:31.340]   It's one thing.
[01:47:31.340 --> 01:47:32.340]   It's Slack.
[01:47:32.340 --> 01:47:34.820]   There's a lot of third party integrations and things like that that make it.
[01:47:34.820 --> 01:47:36.020]   It works with everything.
[01:47:36.020 --> 01:47:38.860]   Including Google Docs and everything.
[01:47:38.860 --> 01:47:41.740]   The free version of Slack only allows 10 integrations.
[01:47:41.740 --> 01:47:44.940]   You can only keep 10,000 messages of history.
[01:47:44.940 --> 01:47:46.340]   That might be fine for us.
[01:47:46.340 --> 01:47:47.340]   Actually, we may end up doing this.
[01:47:47.340 --> 01:47:48.540]   And Slack's still not encrypted.
[01:47:48.540 --> 01:47:50.020]   That was, I heard that.
[01:47:50.020 --> 01:47:51.020]   It is encrypted.
[01:47:51.020 --> 01:47:52.540]   Oh, okay.
[01:47:52.540 --> 01:47:53.700]   That's actually an interesting question.
[01:47:53.700 --> 01:47:54.700]   I believe it is.
[01:47:54.700 --> 01:47:57.900]   There was a big thing going around a couple of years ago that they might have been hacked
[01:47:57.900 --> 01:47:59.940]   and everything was going to be.
[01:47:59.940 --> 01:48:00.940]   I remember that.
[01:48:00.940 --> 01:48:03.060]   At least at some point.
[01:48:03.060 --> 01:48:04.260]   They really need to encrypt that.
[01:48:04.260 --> 01:48:08.820]   I believe that after that happened, they added encryption.
[01:48:08.820 --> 01:48:10.980]   Yeah, they added encryption fairly recently.
[01:48:10.980 --> 01:48:13.220]   So you certainly would want to use that.
[01:48:13.220 --> 01:48:14.420]   I actually use Keybase.
[01:48:14.420 --> 01:48:15.420]   Keybase.
[01:48:15.420 --> 01:48:16.420]   Yeah.
[01:48:16.420 --> 01:48:18.420]   But see, it's free.
[01:48:18.420 --> 01:48:19.820]   It's really encrypted.
[01:48:19.820 --> 01:48:25.820]   It's using PGP encryption for everything, including encrypted Git and encrypted team messaging.
[01:48:25.820 --> 01:48:28.500]   Some people are using Telegram for this because Telegram has a desktop app.
[01:48:28.500 --> 01:48:34.940]   And the way you sync it is you take your app and then you put into your camera and
[01:48:34.940 --> 01:48:37.900]   it does a QR code.
[01:48:37.900 --> 01:48:38.900]   Yeah, I like it.
[01:48:38.900 --> 01:48:41.460]   And it authenticates that your phone is who you are.
[01:48:41.460 --> 01:48:43.460]   So then if you authenticate it, you're powerful.
[01:48:43.460 --> 01:48:49.740]   Unfortunately, Telegram does roll your own encryption, which is never a good thing.
[01:48:49.740 --> 01:48:51.700]   They claim, oh no, we're absolutely secure.
[01:48:51.700 --> 01:48:52.700]   We've got a bounty.
[01:48:52.700 --> 01:48:54.020]   Anybody breaks our encryption.
[01:48:54.020 --> 01:48:55.020]   I doubt it.
[01:48:55.020 --> 01:48:56.020]   Yeah.
[01:48:56.020 --> 01:48:57.860]   I think Putin's got his hands on all these things.
[01:48:57.860 --> 01:49:01.380]   Well, that's an interesting thing because of course, for a long time, the creator of
[01:49:01.380 --> 01:49:07.700]   Telegram was a Pavol Durov, who was the Zuckerberg of Russia.
[01:49:07.700 --> 01:49:13.380]   He had the number one social networking Russia until Putin basically stole it.
[01:49:13.380 --> 01:49:17.220]   And Durov is now outside of Russia and he claims to hate Putin.
[01:49:17.220 --> 01:49:18.220]   But you never can...
[01:49:18.220 --> 01:49:19.220]   Sounds like a good cover to me.
[01:49:19.220 --> 01:49:20.220]   You can never be sure, right?
[01:49:20.220 --> 01:49:21.220]   I said that I want to see Americans.
[01:49:21.220 --> 01:49:23.260]   I don't buy it.
[01:49:23.260 --> 01:49:24.260]   I trust no one.
[01:49:24.260 --> 01:49:25.260]   Yeah.
[01:49:25.260 --> 01:49:27.580]   After Maria Butina, now I'm thinking Red Sparrow was a true story.
[01:49:27.580 --> 01:49:28.580]   Of course.
[01:49:28.580 --> 01:49:29.820]   Have you watched the TV show The Americans?
[01:49:29.820 --> 01:49:30.820]   Yeah, I love it.
[01:49:30.820 --> 01:49:31.820]   Incredible.
[01:49:31.820 --> 01:49:32.820]   I just watched the final season.
[01:49:32.820 --> 01:49:34.780]   It's about a family that's embedded.
[01:49:34.780 --> 01:49:38.500]   Actually, the mother and father are embedded Soviet spies.
[01:49:38.500 --> 01:49:43.660]   It's based on real people and the real person is based on sleeper units.
[01:49:43.660 --> 01:49:46.580]   They actually own the travel agency.
[01:49:46.580 --> 01:49:50.300]   That cover, it's a perfect cover for sleeper agents.
[01:49:50.300 --> 01:49:51.460]   Perfect travel lot.
[01:49:51.460 --> 01:49:52.460]   Exactly.
[01:49:52.460 --> 01:49:54.940]   And yeah, all that stuff really happened.
[01:49:54.940 --> 01:49:55.940]   Yeah.
[01:49:55.940 --> 01:49:56.940]   And with all the...
[01:49:56.940 --> 01:50:01.340]   What we're learning about Russia, that this is the tip of the iceberg.
[01:50:01.340 --> 01:50:03.900]   This has been going on since the Soviet Union.
[01:50:03.900 --> 01:50:04.900]   They're good at it.
[01:50:04.900 --> 01:50:08.620]   It never stopped their master spies because this is how they live.
[01:50:08.620 --> 01:50:10.700]   Their economy is half the size of California's.
[01:50:10.700 --> 01:50:11.700]   Yeah.
[01:50:11.700 --> 01:50:12.700]   They're not as big as Italy.
[01:50:12.700 --> 01:50:14.260]   They're bread and butter.
[01:50:14.260 --> 01:50:21.540]   They're smaller on a per capita basis than Trinidad and Tobago.
[01:50:21.540 --> 01:50:24.860]   And yet they're this global player in part because of all these dirty tricks and spying
[01:50:24.860 --> 01:50:25.860]   and disinformation.
[01:50:25.860 --> 01:50:28.460]   They used brothers and arms for the last episode.
[01:50:28.460 --> 01:50:29.460]   Yeah.
[01:50:29.460 --> 01:50:30.460]   Really great.
[01:50:30.460 --> 01:50:31.460]   I haven't seen it.
[01:50:31.460 --> 01:50:34.260]   I'm not going to tell you anything, but they literally play the whole extended version
[01:50:34.260 --> 01:50:35.260]   of the song.
[01:50:35.260 --> 01:50:36.260]   Really?
[01:50:36.260 --> 01:50:37.260]   A montage kind of...
[01:50:37.260 --> 01:50:38.260]   Oh, nice.
[01:50:38.260 --> 01:50:39.260]   It's incredible.
[01:50:39.260 --> 01:50:40.260]   Killer last season, killer last episode.
[01:50:40.260 --> 01:50:41.260]   Yeah.
[01:50:41.260 --> 01:50:42.260]   It's very magical.
[01:50:42.260 --> 01:50:43.260]   We're talking about the Soviets.
[01:50:43.260 --> 01:50:44.260]   Super.
[01:50:44.260 --> 01:50:45.260]   All right.
[01:50:45.260 --> 01:50:48.220]   And we have the leagues, by the way, speaking of tech, he's getting kicked out imminently.
[01:50:48.220 --> 01:50:50.060]   Ecuador has decided to...
[01:50:50.060 --> 01:50:54.300]   Julian Assange, Ecuador has decided to withdraw his status, his protected status.
[01:50:54.300 --> 01:50:57.420]   He's been living in the Ecuadorian embassy in London for ages.
[01:50:57.420 --> 01:50:59.260]   They're going to throw him from the window.
[01:50:59.260 --> 01:51:03.540]   As soon as he walks out that door, he'll be arrested immediately and extradited the
[01:51:03.540 --> 01:51:04.540]   United States.
[01:51:04.540 --> 01:51:07.940]   And that will be very interesting because, well, for a long time, I thought good things
[01:51:07.940 --> 01:51:09.100]   about Julian and WikiLeaks.
[01:51:09.100 --> 01:51:11.220]   I thought they are telling truth to power.
[01:51:11.220 --> 01:51:15.540]   It was because of them that we learned about some of the drone usage in the United States.
[01:51:15.540 --> 01:51:16.700]   And I thought that was very good.
[01:51:16.700 --> 01:51:20.020]   But now I wonder if he is not, in fact, an agent.
[01:51:20.020 --> 01:51:21.740]   They're telling lies for power.
[01:51:21.740 --> 01:51:22.740]   Yeah.
[01:51:22.740 --> 01:51:28.580]   And I think that they either work for Putin or they were a tool for Putin.
[01:51:28.580 --> 01:51:29.580]   So they basically...
[01:51:29.580 --> 01:51:31.500]   Unwitting tool?
[01:51:31.500 --> 01:51:32.500]   Or dopey.
[01:51:32.500 --> 01:51:34.300]   Like I'm seriously truly honest, like a dope.
[01:51:34.300 --> 01:51:38.300]   He's like this dopey guy who wants to be famous complex.
[01:51:38.300 --> 01:51:39.940]   He's a narcissist.
[01:51:39.940 --> 01:51:42.340]   In other words, he's exactly like the president.
[01:51:42.340 --> 01:51:43.340]   Exactly.
[01:51:43.340 --> 01:51:47.540]   But he's a crazy narcissist who wanted everybody to pay attention to him and be powerful.
[01:51:47.540 --> 01:51:48.540]   Are you talking about Assange?
[01:51:48.540 --> 01:51:49.540]   I can't tell.
[01:51:49.540 --> 01:51:50.540]   Okay.
[01:51:50.540 --> 01:51:51.540]   Okay.
[01:51:51.540 --> 01:51:54.060]   I'm not going to talk about him and mission accomplished.
[01:51:54.060 --> 01:51:55.060]   But he...
[01:51:55.060 --> 01:51:56.060]   On the other hand...
[01:51:56.060 --> 01:51:57.060]   He gives Chelsea Clinton...
[01:51:57.060 --> 01:51:58.060]   Chelsey Manning.
[01:51:58.060 --> 01:52:00.220]   Manning to give up all the stuff.
[01:52:00.220 --> 01:52:01.660]   Chelsea Manning was just like...
[01:52:01.660 --> 01:52:03.660]   She just got screwed.
[01:52:03.660 --> 01:52:04.660]   She got screwed.
[01:52:04.660 --> 01:52:08.060]   And she went to jail for all this time and he just gets away with it.
[01:52:08.060 --> 01:52:11.140]   And I think the Russians were giving him all this hacked stuff.
[01:52:11.140 --> 01:52:13.660]   He was happy to get it to become famous.
[01:52:13.660 --> 01:52:17.060]   But he just released it without looking at it.
[01:52:17.060 --> 01:52:18.060]   You know?
[01:52:18.060 --> 01:52:21.500]   Is it possible though that Julian Assange is on the side of the angels and that...
[01:52:21.500 --> 01:52:27.140]   The governments are so upset by WikiLeaks that they're doing anything they can that Swedes
[01:52:27.140 --> 01:52:29.260]   tried that failed.
[01:52:29.260 --> 01:52:31.020]   Now the US is working with Ecuador.
[01:52:31.020 --> 01:52:33.060]   Clearly the US is putting a lot of pressure on Ecuador.
[01:52:33.060 --> 01:52:39.540]   They were able to get Ecuador to withdraw their breast milk versus resolution by threatening
[01:52:39.540 --> 01:52:40.540]   them economically.
[01:52:40.540 --> 01:52:41.540]   Yeah.
[01:52:41.540 --> 01:52:43.820]   I'm sure that's what's going on with Assange.
[01:52:43.820 --> 01:52:46.780]   Isn't it possible that he's just an enemy of all governments?
[01:52:46.780 --> 01:52:47.780]   I would say just a nobody of all governments.
[01:52:47.780 --> 01:52:49.740]   Snowden seemed like the principled person of the two.
[01:52:49.740 --> 01:52:50.740]   But where's he living?
[01:52:50.740 --> 01:52:51.980]   He's in Russia now.
[01:52:51.980 --> 01:52:53.460]   Yeah.
[01:52:53.460 --> 01:52:54.460]   And so who knows?
[01:52:54.460 --> 01:52:57.140]   I don't want to be a conspiracy theorist.
[01:52:57.140 --> 01:53:02.100]   It's so easy to fall into that trap of all their secret stuff going on with him.
[01:53:02.100 --> 01:53:03.900]   But it feels like there's secret stuff going on.
[01:53:03.900 --> 01:53:06.780]   Of course we don't know what's going on.
[01:53:06.780 --> 01:53:07.780]   And that's what we're made.
[01:53:07.780 --> 01:53:10.300]   I don't want to be a soft brain conspiracy theorist.
[01:53:10.300 --> 01:53:11.700]   That is what we're...
[01:53:11.700 --> 01:53:14.980]   That is Putin's design is to create chaos and put doubt.
[01:53:14.980 --> 01:53:15.980]   That's what he has to do.
[01:53:15.980 --> 01:53:16.980]   Because then nobody...
[01:53:16.980 --> 01:53:17.980]   You don't know what's true.
[01:53:17.980 --> 01:53:18.980]   You don't know what's true.
[01:53:18.980 --> 01:53:19.980]   You feel ungrounded and you give up.
[01:53:19.980 --> 01:53:20.980]   And then they stay in power.
[01:53:20.980 --> 01:53:25.220]   A great recent movie that shows how kind of fake news works is chapaquitic.
[01:53:25.220 --> 01:53:26.220]   I don't know if you've seen that before.
[01:53:26.220 --> 01:53:27.220]   Why got to watch it?
[01:53:27.220 --> 01:53:28.220]   It's fantastic.
[01:53:28.220 --> 01:53:29.220]   It's a good Kennedy story.
[01:53:29.220 --> 01:53:30.220]   It's really good.
[01:53:30.220 --> 01:53:31.220]   They show you what really happens.
[01:53:31.220 --> 01:53:33.620]   No, one of the reasons they made me nervous is we don't know what really happened.
[01:53:33.620 --> 01:53:34.620]   Exactly.
[01:53:34.620 --> 01:53:35.620]   They handled all that stuff really well.
[01:53:35.620 --> 01:53:36.620]   Okay.
[01:53:36.620 --> 01:53:37.620]   I think.
[01:53:37.620 --> 01:53:41.420]   They didn't have a point of view on, well, it really happened or no.
[01:53:41.420 --> 01:53:42.420]   They went conservative.
[01:53:42.420 --> 01:53:45.780]   They did have a point of view, but they didn't accuse them of having an affair.
[01:53:45.780 --> 01:53:46.780]   They didn't...
[01:53:46.780 --> 01:53:47.780]   None of that stuff.
[01:53:47.780 --> 01:53:50.460]   They showed...
[01:53:50.460 --> 01:53:55.380]   The best part of the movie to me was all the power players saying, "Okay, how are we going
[01:53:55.380 --> 01:53:56.380]   to spin this?
[01:53:56.380 --> 01:53:57.380]   How are we going to do this?
[01:53:57.380 --> 01:53:58.380]   Call this guy and turn his arm."
[01:53:58.380 --> 01:53:59.380]   It's like, "Why is the dog?"
[01:53:59.380 --> 01:54:00.380]   We know that stuff happened.
[01:54:00.380 --> 01:54:03.100]   But then at the end of the movie, I hope I don't spoil it.
[01:54:03.100 --> 01:54:04.860]   I hope this isn't a spoiler.
[01:54:04.860 --> 01:54:06.060]   It's not a spoiler.
[01:54:06.060 --> 01:54:11.420]   They show actual footage of people in Massachusetts being interviewed after Kennedy gave the
[01:54:11.420 --> 01:54:16.860]   speech supposedly coming clean after you've gotten all this information about what really
[01:54:16.860 --> 01:54:18.380]   happened, how they spun it.
[01:54:18.380 --> 01:54:22.540]   They were interviewing people in the streets going, "Yeah, I think you can see the public
[01:54:22.540 --> 01:54:23.540]   just completely buying.
[01:54:23.540 --> 01:54:25.620]   Hookline is sinker."
[01:54:25.620 --> 01:54:28.500]   This concocted fabrication about...
[01:54:28.500 --> 01:54:34.340]   And goodness knows, Grandpa Joe, actually Daddy Joe, did plenty of that.
[01:54:34.340 --> 01:54:36.540]   He was a major player in all this stuff.
[01:54:36.540 --> 01:54:37.540]   It's a legend in that.
[01:54:37.540 --> 01:54:40.740]   He was an evil person, for sure.
[01:54:40.740 --> 01:54:45.220]   The point is that the fake news has been with us for a long time and now it's just
[01:54:45.220 --> 01:54:47.700]   weaponized with all kinds of high-tech stuff and social media.
[01:54:47.700 --> 01:54:50.220]   What's the person to do?
[01:54:50.220 --> 01:54:51.740]   I talked to people all the time.
[01:54:51.740 --> 01:54:54.380]   I talked to somebody on the other day on the radio shows that, "Yeah, I get all my news
[01:54:54.380 --> 01:54:55.380]   from Facebook."
[01:54:55.380 --> 01:55:01.260]   And I said, "You know, I actually gave her a list of ways to get news not from Facebook
[01:55:01.260 --> 01:55:03.700]   because that's obviously the worst possible."
[01:55:03.700 --> 01:55:06.340]   I like to listen to both sides.
[01:55:06.340 --> 01:55:08.260]   So I listen to extreme people on both sides.
[01:55:08.260 --> 01:55:16.580]   I'll listen to Ben Shapiro on the right and I'll listen to on the left like Rachel Maddow.
[01:55:16.580 --> 01:55:22.500]   And so they have completely divergent positions of party affiliation, but they're both intellectually
[01:55:22.500 --> 01:55:23.500]   honest.
[01:55:23.500 --> 01:55:25.700]   And then in the middle, you have this sort of intellectual dark web that's been growing.
[01:55:25.700 --> 01:55:27.540]   I wouldn't call them intellectually honest.
[01:55:27.540 --> 01:55:34.940]   They're both artificially par the left, the right.
[01:55:34.940 --> 01:55:36.820]   Because that's how you juice up viewers.
[01:55:36.820 --> 01:55:40.580]   You know what I'm really liking a lot these days is national review for the right.
[01:55:40.580 --> 01:55:42.220]   They are intellectually honest.
[01:55:42.220 --> 01:55:43.220]   I like these ingredients.
[01:55:43.220 --> 01:55:44.220]   And I'll show these ingredients.
[01:55:44.220 --> 01:55:45.220]   These magazines are great too.
[01:55:45.220 --> 01:55:46.220]   They're not exactly all the way to the right.
[01:55:46.220 --> 01:55:49.740]   Yeah, it's like weed smoking capitalists basically.
[01:55:49.740 --> 01:55:55.220]   But actually check out the national review for solid, intellectually rigorous, honest,
[01:55:55.220 --> 01:55:56.940]   like right wing, very rowing.
[01:55:56.940 --> 01:56:01.260]   I do think getting back to the very beginning of the show that we are in troll land now.
[01:56:01.260 --> 01:56:02.260]   Yeah.
[01:56:02.260 --> 01:56:03.260]   And a lot of it is because...
[01:56:03.260 --> 01:56:04.260]   We choose it.
[01:56:04.260 --> 01:56:09.540]   If you want to succeed as a publication on the web or anywhere, you want to generate
[01:56:09.540 --> 01:56:12.220]   hits, you want to generate clicks.
[01:56:12.220 --> 01:56:14.500]   And the way we do it is getting people wound up.
[01:56:14.500 --> 01:56:15.500]   And it seems to me everything...
[01:56:15.500 --> 01:56:17.300]   The more I read this, the better.
[01:56:17.300 --> 01:56:21.700]   Everything that's happening right now, nobody who doesn't get people wound up is going to
[01:56:21.700 --> 01:56:23.340]   have a voice.
[01:56:23.340 --> 01:56:24.340]   Unless they have subscribers.
[01:56:24.340 --> 01:56:27.820]   And so I think if you want to do something patriotic, I think subscribing to Washington
[01:56:27.820 --> 01:56:30.860]   Post, Wall Street Journal, New York Times, just to support them.
[01:56:30.860 --> 01:56:31.860]   Just to support them.
[01:56:31.860 --> 01:56:32.860]   I don't trust the New York Times anymore.
[01:56:32.860 --> 01:56:35.380]   I used to think they were the Journal of Record.
[01:56:35.380 --> 01:56:37.620]   They have all sorts of axes to grind.
[01:56:37.620 --> 01:56:38.780]   I think they have some axes to grind.
[01:56:38.780 --> 01:56:40.460]   I think the Journal editorial page does too.
[01:56:40.460 --> 01:56:43.740]   And I think if you read four or five of them, you can kind of triangulate.
[01:56:43.740 --> 01:56:44.740]   Yeah.
[01:56:44.740 --> 01:56:45.740]   You're basically trying to triangulate on the two.
[01:56:45.740 --> 01:56:46.740]   I'm just more confused.
[01:56:46.740 --> 01:56:47.740]   I'm just more confused.
[01:56:47.740 --> 01:56:51.580]   Here from the Wall Street Journal, a story you may or may not believe.
[01:56:51.580 --> 01:56:59.740]   Russian hackers reach US utility control rooms, Homeland Security officials say.
[01:56:59.740 --> 01:57:03.700]   In a lot of them, now we've known this has been going on for a long time.
[01:57:03.700 --> 01:57:06.140]   The hackers, they did this in the Ukraine.
[01:57:06.140 --> 01:57:07.660]   Sorry, not the Ukraine.
[01:57:07.660 --> 01:57:13.060]   They did this in Ukraine, an independent nation called Ukraine, not a region of the Soviet
[01:57:13.060 --> 01:57:15.740]   Union called the Ukraine.
[01:57:15.740 --> 01:57:18.100]   And they brought the grid down just for four hours.
[01:57:18.100 --> 01:57:19.420]   It was clearly a test.
[01:57:19.420 --> 01:57:20.420]   Yes.
[01:57:20.420 --> 01:57:26.900]   This seems like a mistake because essentially they're teaching their adversaries, including
[01:57:26.900 --> 01:57:32.460]   the United States, how do guard against an attack when the rubber really meets the road
[01:57:32.460 --> 01:57:33.460]   someday?
[01:57:33.460 --> 01:57:34.460]   You should really do this quietly.
[01:57:34.460 --> 01:57:39.500]   Yeah, you should figure out how to do it without alerting the other side because now,
[01:57:39.500 --> 01:57:40.740]   you know, what's going to happen now?
[01:57:40.740 --> 01:57:44.660]   There's going to be this scramble to patch and fix and protect and so on.
[01:57:44.660 --> 01:57:46.140]   People are getting beginning these cool keys.
[01:57:46.140 --> 01:57:47.140]   Maybe.
[01:57:47.140 --> 01:57:48.740]   Although this, as you said, this has been going on for a long time.
[01:57:48.740 --> 01:57:50.780]   We've known about it and it's still happening.
[01:57:50.780 --> 01:57:51.780]   Yeah.
[01:57:51.780 --> 01:57:55.940]   According to the journal, the Russian hackers who worked for a shadowy state sponsored group
[01:57:55.940 --> 01:57:59.100]   previously identified as dragonfly or energetic bear.
[01:57:59.100 --> 01:58:00.100]   There's also fancy bear.
[01:58:00.100 --> 01:58:01.100]   Fancy.
[01:58:01.100 --> 01:58:02.100]   He's very fancy.
[01:58:02.100 --> 01:58:07.460]   There's a lot of bears broke into a supposedly secure air gap or isolated networks owned
[01:58:07.460 --> 01:58:12.820]   by utilities with relative ease by first penetrating the networks of key vendors.
[01:58:12.820 --> 01:58:19.460]   This is how target was broken into was the HVAC vendor who had trusted relationships
[01:58:19.460 --> 01:58:21.060]   with the power companies.
[01:58:21.060 --> 01:58:23.740]   According to the Department of Homeland Security, they got to the point where they could have
[01:58:23.740 --> 01:58:27.180]   thrown switches and disrupted power flows.
[01:58:27.180 --> 01:58:28.180]   But here's the point.
[01:58:28.180 --> 01:58:31.460]   DHS has been warning utilities since 2014.
[01:58:31.460 --> 01:58:40.940]   They're going to have to create some controls and fines for these and this critical infrastructure.
[01:58:40.940 --> 01:58:44.540]   It would be, I think people would consider it an act of war if they did this kind of stuff.
[01:58:44.540 --> 01:58:45.540]   It is.
[01:58:45.540 --> 01:58:47.060]   And that's one of the things that they should.
[01:58:47.060 --> 01:58:51.420]   Most people don't consider it an act of war to what they did with Hillary's Clinton's
[01:58:51.420 --> 01:58:53.940]   email and hacking into the DNC and hacking our election.
[01:58:53.940 --> 01:58:55.180]   They don't consider that an act of war.
[01:58:55.180 --> 01:58:56.180]   That's why they do it.
[01:58:56.180 --> 01:58:57.180]   And that's why they do it.
[01:58:57.180 --> 01:58:59.260]   So I think this might be a line they don't want to cross.
[01:58:59.260 --> 01:59:01.340]   But I do think we need to take it much more seriously.
[01:59:01.340 --> 01:59:07.300]   And then if you watch a show like the Americans or you look at this recent spy who was obviously
[01:59:07.300 --> 01:59:10.620]   using sex as a weapon to compromise it, I mean you go to one of these.
[01:59:10.620 --> 01:59:11.620]   Marina between that.
[01:59:11.620 --> 01:59:12.620]   Yeah.
[01:59:12.620 --> 01:59:15.260]   I mean if you go to one of these dopey guys, you know, working at.
[01:59:15.260 --> 01:59:16.260]   Yeah, she was 29.
[01:59:16.260 --> 01:59:17.260]   They were all in their 60s.
[01:59:17.260 --> 01:59:18.260]   Yeah.
[01:59:18.260 --> 01:59:19.260]   50 year old guys.
[01:59:19.260 --> 01:59:20.260]   She's like, hey, I'll have a man in my 60s.
[01:59:20.260 --> 01:59:21.260]   Yeah.
[01:59:21.260 --> 01:59:22.260]   I'll have sex with you.
[01:59:22.260 --> 01:59:23.980]   I just want to give me your key card.
[01:59:23.980 --> 01:59:24.980]   Okay.
[01:59:24.980 --> 01:59:25.980]   Give me access.
[01:59:25.980 --> 01:59:26.980]   It's like, you go.
[01:59:26.980 --> 01:59:27.980]   And they're just thinking and she likes guns too.
[01:59:27.980 --> 01:59:28.980]   Wow.
[01:59:28.980 --> 01:59:29.980]   Wow.
[01:59:29.980 --> 01:59:31.180]   What could possibly go rushing guns?
[01:59:31.180 --> 01:59:33.180]   No, no alarm bells going off.
[01:59:33.180 --> 01:59:39.060]   No, no, in the next prediction in the next five years there will be an open cyber warfare
[01:59:39.060 --> 01:59:40.540]   ongoing.
[01:59:40.540 --> 01:59:46.300]   We have actually promoted the United States cyber command is now at a peer to the Navy
[01:59:46.300 --> 01:59:48.220]   and the Army and the Marines in the US.
[01:59:48.220 --> 01:59:49.700]   Didn't Trump kill that?
[01:59:49.700 --> 01:59:50.700]   No, no.
[01:59:50.700 --> 01:59:51.700]   I just never anybody running it.
[01:59:51.700 --> 01:59:52.700]   I think it's the issue.
[01:59:52.700 --> 01:59:55.900]   Maybe he killed the oversight of the unification of the various.
[01:59:55.900 --> 01:59:57.740]   Yeah, but this happened fairly recently.
[01:59:57.740 --> 01:59:58.980]   Was it part of the NSA?
[01:59:58.980 --> 01:59:59.980]   It is now.
[01:59:59.980 --> 02:00:00.980]   Yeah.
[02:00:00.980 --> 02:00:01.980]   Do D force.
[02:00:01.980 --> 02:00:05.060]   We're now going to have space for space force on my watch.
[02:00:05.060 --> 02:00:06.060]   That's going to be good.
[02:00:06.060 --> 02:00:07.060]   And space.
[02:00:07.060 --> 02:00:08.060]   Yeah, incredible.
[02:00:08.060 --> 02:00:10.820]   You do a lot of impressions.
[02:00:10.820 --> 02:00:12.060]   You're very good.
[02:00:12.060 --> 02:00:15.020]   I just do it to annoy my wife in the car.
[02:00:15.020 --> 02:00:18.540]   I just practice like it.
[02:00:18.540 --> 02:00:24.020]   So it is now a full and independent and independent unified combatant command, which makes means
[02:00:24.020 --> 02:00:25.740]   something as of May.
[02:00:25.740 --> 02:00:27.660]   I really feel like we're gearing up for this.
[02:00:27.660 --> 02:00:31.540]   And yet, and I'm not looking forward to it because North Korea has no targets.
[02:00:31.540 --> 02:00:32.540]   You know what I mean?
[02:00:32.540 --> 02:00:33.540]   What are you going to do?
[02:00:33.540 --> 02:00:34.540]   Bring down their infrastructure.
[02:00:34.540 --> 02:00:35.540]   A little rocket man.
[02:00:35.540 --> 02:00:36.540]   We had a great I feel we'd have a great relationship.
[02:00:36.540 --> 02:00:37.540]   I have a better button.
[02:00:37.540 --> 02:00:38.540]   I bet.
[02:00:38.540 --> 02:00:39.540]   If we played it's Fortnite together.
[02:00:39.540 --> 02:00:41.540]   I think it'd be huge.
[02:00:41.540 --> 02:00:42.780]   Well, and that's the other thing.
[02:00:42.780 --> 02:00:44.180]   Talk about breads and spread and circus.
[02:00:44.180 --> 02:00:45.180]   Yeah.
[02:00:45.180 --> 02:00:47.540]   And I almost feel like I'm compliant complicit in this.
[02:00:47.540 --> 02:00:48.540]   Yeah.
[02:00:48.540 --> 02:00:49.540]   Don't we talk about his Fortnite?
[02:00:49.540 --> 02:00:50.540]   Awesome.
[02:00:50.540 --> 02:00:51.540]   Right?
[02:00:51.540 --> 02:00:52.540]   Got to play the more of that game.
[02:00:52.540 --> 02:00:53.540]   Coming out on Android pretty soon, by the way.
[02:00:53.540 --> 02:00:54.540]   Yeah, very exciting.
[02:00:54.540 --> 02:00:57.460]   And me, you know, so we're fiddling while Rome burned.
[02:00:57.460 --> 02:00:58.460]   Yes.
[02:00:58.460 --> 02:00:59.460]   Is it?
[02:00:59.460 --> 02:01:00.460]   What should we do?
[02:01:00.460 --> 02:01:03.780]   Well, on the other hand, Trump is the metatrol and he's trying to get our attention.
[02:01:03.780 --> 02:01:06.220]   And I think that's the economic damage he's doing.
[02:01:06.220 --> 02:01:07.540]   He's distracting everyone.
[02:01:07.540 --> 02:01:08.540]   I think we should fiddle.
[02:01:08.540 --> 02:01:12.260]   That'll show him.
[02:01:12.260 --> 02:01:17.220]   It feels to me like when you, since we're at the point where we went there, it just feels
[02:01:17.220 --> 02:01:19.100]   to me like we're starting.
[02:01:19.100 --> 02:01:22.100]   It's the beginning of the end, it feels like, with the spoiler investigation.
[02:01:22.100 --> 02:01:24.540]   You have your bug out.
[02:01:24.540 --> 02:01:28.900]   Did you buy that condo in the SAC Command Center in Idaho?
[02:01:28.900 --> 02:01:30.940]   You don't have your go bag.
[02:01:30.940 --> 02:01:31.940]   Do you have?
[02:01:31.940 --> 02:01:32.940]   Oh, no, I'm not worried about that.
[02:01:32.940 --> 02:01:33.940]   Do you have land in New Zealand?
[02:01:33.940 --> 02:01:34.940]   You're going to go there?
[02:01:34.940 --> 02:01:35.940]   No, no, no, I'll stay here.
[02:01:35.940 --> 02:01:36.940]   I hear your friends do.
[02:01:36.940 --> 02:01:37.940]   Yeah.
[02:01:37.940 --> 02:01:42.380]   Well, it's stupid because where you're going to go, honestly?
[02:01:42.380 --> 02:01:44.180]   If it all goes to hell, there's no other way.
[02:01:44.180 --> 02:01:46.220]   No, I've got my pilot and he's going to take me to New Zealand.
[02:01:46.220 --> 02:01:49.660]   It's like, no, your pilot's going to take your plane and his family to New Zealand.
[02:01:49.660 --> 02:01:50.660]   Or I don't.
[02:01:50.660 --> 02:01:51.660]   And leaving you behind.
[02:01:51.660 --> 02:01:54.300]   When the human race is all dead, I'll have the last laugh.
[02:01:54.300 --> 02:01:56.100]   I mean, what are they thinking is going to be the...
[02:01:56.100 --> 02:01:59.500]   You might want to just try to solve humanity's problems now and participate in the solutions
[02:01:59.500 --> 02:02:01.380]   rather than run into New Zealand.
[02:02:01.380 --> 02:02:04.140]   Start pumping iron so that you're the stronger of the two.
[02:02:04.140 --> 02:02:05.380]   Listen, I watch Walking Dead.
[02:02:05.380 --> 02:02:07.980]   I am going to make it to like season five or six.
[02:02:07.980 --> 02:02:09.980]   If Peter Thiel's not making it out on episode one.
[02:02:09.980 --> 02:02:10.980]   You're ready.
[02:02:10.980 --> 02:02:11.980]   You're ready.
[02:02:11.980 --> 02:02:12.980]   For sure.
[02:02:12.980 --> 02:02:13.980]   What are you going to do to make it up to episode season five?
[02:02:13.980 --> 02:02:14.980]   I am clever.
[02:02:14.980 --> 02:02:16.980]   I am clever as F.
[02:02:16.980 --> 02:02:21.260]   And do your baseball bat with a nail in it.
[02:02:21.260 --> 02:02:22.260]   Absolutely.
[02:02:22.260 --> 02:02:23.260]   I'll be fine.
[02:02:23.260 --> 02:02:24.260]   Don't worry about J-Cal.
[02:02:24.260 --> 02:02:30.660]   But I do think that it does feel like with this Mueller investigation and all the stuff
[02:02:30.660 --> 02:02:32.580]   that's coming out that I think it's the end game.
[02:02:32.580 --> 02:02:35.100]   And I had somebody who was like close to politics.
[02:02:35.100 --> 02:02:38.660]   It's like, yeah, they're going to give it like two years when this all wraps up.
[02:02:38.660 --> 02:02:41.460]   The Republicans are going to just pull the rug out from under and put pens in charge.
[02:02:41.460 --> 02:02:42.460]   Right.
[02:02:42.460 --> 02:02:43.460]   It will go from house to cards too.
[02:02:43.460 --> 02:02:45.460]   Somebody in the government told me this.
[02:02:45.460 --> 02:02:47.980]   It was like, no, no, it will be fine.
[02:02:47.980 --> 02:02:49.140]   Patents is not going to go handmaid's tail.
[02:02:49.140 --> 02:02:52.100]   It will be like more conservative than most people want it.
[02:02:52.100 --> 02:02:53.100]   He'll play ball.
[02:02:53.100 --> 02:02:54.100]   He'll play ball.
[02:02:54.100 --> 02:02:55.100]   It will be fine again.
[02:02:55.100 --> 02:02:56.100]   I think we're going to get through it.
[02:02:56.100 --> 02:02:57.100]   This is a giant civics lesson.
[02:02:57.100 --> 02:02:59.260]   The truth is it's fine now.
[02:02:59.260 --> 02:03:00.260]   It really is.
[02:03:00.260 --> 02:03:02.820]   The Washington politics don't affect us as much as we think they do.
[02:03:02.820 --> 02:03:03.820]   That's really the truth.
[02:03:03.820 --> 02:03:10.340]   And in fact, I keep seeing polls say that people, most people besides the media elites,
[02:03:10.340 --> 02:03:13.580]   aren't even really aware of it.
[02:03:13.580 --> 02:03:14.580]   They don't even know about the Russian.
[02:03:14.580 --> 02:03:16.580]   Have our lives changed that much at all?
[02:03:16.580 --> 02:03:17.580]   It makes me sad.
[02:03:17.580 --> 02:03:18.580]   It makes you sad.
[02:03:18.580 --> 02:03:19.580]   It makes you sad.
[02:03:19.580 --> 02:03:20.580]   It makes you sad.
[02:03:20.580 --> 02:03:22.620]   We've said that for years that politics doesn't matter.
[02:03:22.620 --> 02:03:23.620]   That's why I don't vote.
[02:03:23.620 --> 02:03:24.620]   That's how I got there.
[02:03:24.620 --> 02:03:25.620]   Nobody voted.
[02:03:25.620 --> 02:03:26.620]   Right.
[02:03:26.620 --> 02:03:27.620]   And that makes me sad.
[02:03:27.620 --> 02:03:28.620]   Yeah.
[02:03:28.620 --> 02:03:30.020]   I feel like we should care.
[02:03:30.020 --> 02:03:31.020]   But you're right.
[02:03:31.020 --> 02:03:32.620]   And the long run doesn't seem to make that much of it.
[02:03:32.620 --> 02:03:34.340]   It's as bad as you could get.
[02:03:34.340 --> 02:03:35.620]   It's as incompetent as you can get.
[02:03:35.620 --> 02:03:36.620]   It doesn't seem to make any difference.
[02:03:36.620 --> 02:03:38.500]   The landscape of the mind has changed.
[02:03:38.500 --> 02:03:41.980]   And the actual material reality of our lives has not really.
[02:03:41.980 --> 02:03:49.620]   Yeah, I just want to read if there's an unknown, one of these unknown unknowns could happen.
[02:03:49.620 --> 02:03:54.700]   Well, that's what Russian hackers in the grid, that's an unknown unknown.
[02:03:54.700 --> 02:03:56.060]   It's pretty sinister when you think about it.
[02:03:56.060 --> 02:04:01.420]   They basically took the issue, which rips Americans apart most guns.
[02:04:01.420 --> 02:04:06.260]   And they're like infiltrating the end race and then combine both of them.
[02:04:06.260 --> 02:04:10.660]   And basically weaponize us against each other over this issue.
[02:04:10.660 --> 02:04:12.060]   But look at how much we're learning.
[02:04:12.060 --> 02:04:14.260]   The Kannamarzwehrlürburg is a moral.
[02:04:14.260 --> 02:04:15.260]   Putin.
[02:04:15.260 --> 02:04:16.260]   Putin.
[02:04:16.260 --> 02:04:17.260]   Putin.
[02:04:17.260 --> 02:04:19.860]   Let's take a break.
[02:04:19.860 --> 02:04:24.940]   I want to keep going for another four or five hours, but we really probably shouldn't.
[02:04:24.940 --> 02:04:27.660]   Are you watching succession on the showtime?
[02:04:27.660 --> 02:04:28.660]   No.
[02:04:28.660 --> 02:04:29.980]   You should watch that.
[02:04:29.980 --> 02:04:31.500]   It's the Rupert Murdoch story.
[02:04:31.500 --> 02:04:34.820]   It's about an aging right wing media mogul.
[02:04:34.820 --> 02:04:36.020]   Who has a stroke.
[02:04:36.020 --> 02:04:39.340]   He's got five completely useless kids.
[02:04:39.340 --> 02:04:40.340]   Really the worst.
[02:04:40.340 --> 02:04:42.820]   I can't decide which is worse than the other.
[02:04:42.820 --> 02:04:44.260]   All fighting over the remains.
[02:04:44.260 --> 02:04:46.260]   Meanwhile, he's saying, "No, I'm not leaving."
[02:04:46.260 --> 02:04:47.260]   Oh, I like it.
[02:04:47.260 --> 02:04:48.260]   Oh, it's great.
[02:04:48.260 --> 02:04:51.780]   This reminds me more of Redstone because Murdoch is more like Sumner Redstone.
[02:04:51.780 --> 02:04:52.780]   It's more like Sumner Redstone.
[02:04:52.780 --> 02:04:54.700]   It's more like Sumner because Murdoch has got James Murdoch.
[02:04:54.700 --> 02:04:55.700]   It's really smart.
[02:04:55.700 --> 02:04:56.700]   He's actually smart.
[02:04:56.700 --> 02:04:57.700]   He's not really good.
[02:04:57.700 --> 02:04:58.700]   I just saw him recently.
[02:04:58.700 --> 02:05:00.460]   Redstone is noncompassmentous at this point.
[02:05:00.460 --> 02:05:05.220]   And his wife or mistress or somebody's run in the show.
[02:05:05.220 --> 02:05:06.220]   It's so weird.
[02:05:06.220 --> 02:05:07.220]   It's so weird.
[02:05:07.220 --> 02:05:08.220]   I can't wait to.
[02:05:08.220 --> 02:05:09.220]   It got so weird with him.
[02:05:09.220 --> 02:05:13.500]   Yeah, by the time the movie comes out, Leo is the capriarch to play him.
[02:05:13.500 --> 02:05:14.500]   Yeah.
[02:05:14.500 --> 02:05:15.500]   Well, you know what?
[02:05:15.500 --> 02:05:18.100]   When you got billions of dollars, I just want a little tip to you.
[02:05:18.100 --> 02:05:19.100]   Exactly.
[02:05:19.100 --> 02:05:21.100]   When you get to your 80s, it doesn't seem to make any difference.
[02:05:21.100 --> 02:05:24.340]   So I'm going to like want to watch Jeopardy and have fish sticks and go to bed.
[02:05:24.340 --> 02:05:25.820]   I don't know if I want to have eight girlfriends.
[02:05:25.820 --> 02:05:26.820]   I saw that movie.
[02:05:26.820 --> 02:05:29.300]   Did you ever see the Queen of Versailles?
[02:05:29.300 --> 02:05:30.300]   Must watch documentary.
[02:05:30.300 --> 02:05:31.300]   I heard about it.
[02:05:31.300 --> 02:05:32.300]   Exactly that story.
[02:05:32.300 --> 02:05:33.300]   Fish sticks.
[02:05:33.300 --> 02:05:34.300]   Give me some fish sticks.
[02:05:34.300 --> 02:05:35.300]   I'm watching TV.
[02:05:35.300 --> 02:05:37.740]   I get my fish sticks and TV.
[02:05:37.740 --> 02:05:38.740]   It's the...
[02:05:38.740 --> 02:05:41.540]   It's a documentary called the Queen of Versailles.
[02:05:41.540 --> 02:05:48.220]   He was the Timeshare mogul, which means of course you've completely corrupt.
[02:05:48.220 --> 02:05:52.780]   And married this young woman and it's a fabulous story.
[02:05:52.780 --> 02:05:54.500]   But then the Timeshare's collapsed.
[02:05:54.500 --> 02:05:57.460]   And so this young woman is not happy.
[02:05:57.460 --> 02:05:58.460]   Yeah.
[02:05:58.460 --> 02:05:59.460]   She's not happy.
[02:05:59.460 --> 02:06:00.460]   No.
[02:06:00.460 --> 02:06:06.860]   where she goes even though they have no money and lose up ten carts at Toys R Us. Literally.
[02:06:06.860 --> 02:06:10.300]   She's got ten carts. She's pulling she's got a string . . . Our credit cards don't work.
[02:06:10.300 --> 02:06:16.620]   Well I'll go check . . . Our show is brought to you. This portion of it is brought to you by Uber.
[02:06:16.620 --> 02:06:22.060]   I use Uber all the time and in fact even in the elite Uber movement I I struggle and I said,
[02:06:22.060 --> 02:06:23.740]   "No, this is a great service."
[02:06:23.740 --> 02:06:28.460]   Especially when you travel and you know there's an Uber and you've got the app and they are really
[02:06:28.460 --> 02:06:34.700]   moving forward. That's the message they wanted me to tell you that under new management they are
[02:06:34.700 --> 02:06:41.100]   doing a lot to improve your experience and your trust. A lot of new features for riders designed
[02:06:41.100 --> 02:06:45.740]   to take the stress out of the pickup. You've got pickup notes in the Uber app which lets you share
[02:06:45.740 --> 02:06:50.780]   a note with your driver on what you look like, how to spot you, which I love. You could choose a
[02:06:50.780 --> 02:06:54.540]   color to light up your phone screen. So you can say, "Okay my phone's going to light up red. Look
[02:06:54.540 --> 02:06:58.140]   for that." And you hold it up the driver goes right to you. That is huge. Brilliant.
[02:06:58.140 --> 02:07:03.980]   Yeah. They've also of course let you tell somebody that you're on your way so they know what car
[02:07:03.980 --> 02:07:10.060]   you're in when you're coming. Uber is really committed to improving the ride sharing experience
[02:07:10.060 --> 02:07:14.220]   for both riders and drivers. Recently my daughter Abby, I use her as a lot in this example,
[02:07:14.220 --> 02:07:19.580]   I had bought her a car. She had four accidents in a row and I said, "Okay Abby, guess what? You're
[02:07:19.580 --> 02:07:27.100]   not driving anymore but it's cheaper for me to pay for your Uber. It's safer. I know she's not going
[02:07:27.100 --> 02:07:32.140]   to get in an accident. She can text her a little hard out and it's less expensive for me to let
[02:07:32.140 --> 02:07:37.340]   her Uber everywhere. It's been a huge savings when you add in gas and insurance to the cost of the car.
[02:07:37.340 --> 02:07:45.740]   Huge savings and I feel better. I know she's safer. I know she's my mom's same thing. 85 and I use
[02:07:45.740 --> 02:07:49.340]   her as an example all the time too. She's not driving anymore. We got her to give up her car
[02:07:49.340 --> 02:07:53.100]   a few years ago. My sister who lives nearby was driving around but she had to wait till
[02:07:53.100 --> 02:07:57.740]   Eva could do it. I said, "Mom here, I put Uber on her phone. I said, "I'm going to put my credit card
[02:07:57.740 --> 02:08:02.940]   in so you don't have to think about it." She said, "Oh, I don't know. She loves it now. She's
[02:08:02.940 --> 02:08:08.620]   Ubering everywhere and for an 85-year-old, let's give it a real freedom. It's really huge. She can
[02:08:08.620 --> 02:08:13.500]   go to the doctor. She can go shopping and the Uber drivers are great. She loves them." As a nomad,
[02:08:13.500 --> 02:08:18.620]   can I put in a pitch for taking Uber's when you're in foreign cities? Cities like Mexico City
[02:08:18.620 --> 02:08:22.460]   where almost nobody speaks English for some reason. I have no idea why this is the only city in the
[02:08:22.460 --> 02:08:26.540]   world where nobody speaks English where there are a lot of dangerous neighborhoods and you don't
[02:08:26.540 --> 02:08:30.540]   as a visitor don't know where they are where the city is the size of a country essentially.
[02:08:30.540 --> 02:08:35.660]   It looks like the $22 million, $24 million. Uber is an absolute godsend in Mexico City and
[02:08:35.660 --> 02:08:41.500]   places like that cost almost nothing. The person rolls up not in a Volkswagen Beetle
[02:08:41.500 --> 02:08:46.700]   but in a brand new car that takes you right through the worst areas safely. They pick you up with the
[02:08:46.700 --> 02:08:52.380]   app. They pick you up. We actually got lost in Mexico City at night. It was midnight and we're
[02:08:52.380 --> 02:08:59.020]   like, "Oh, this is not good. They came right to us and it was fantastic. When you travel."
[02:08:59.020 --> 02:09:02.380]   I think it's a new Uber and I think that's the communication they want to give you. They're moving
[02:09:02.380 --> 02:09:11.420]   forward. This is a company that is changing the way we get around. Please, just consider
[02:09:11.420 --> 02:09:18.300]   it. I still use it all the time and I trust my mom and my sister with it. I just think it's the
[02:09:18.300 --> 02:09:21.580]   right thing to do. If you want to find out more about what they're doing, the improvements they've
[02:09:21.580 --> 02:09:27.340]   made to the app, their commitment to you as customers go to uber.com/movingforward.
[02:09:27.340 --> 02:09:32.780]   Uber.com/movingforward. Here's what I'm sad about because we did do ads for this. This is the
[02:09:32.780 --> 02:09:36.220]   Bosch funded a company called Mayfield Robotics. I remember this.
[02:09:36.220 --> 02:09:39.020]   Remember this cute little curry robot? We went down there.
[02:09:39.580 --> 02:09:43.020]   Well, it never really did anything.
[02:09:43.020 --> 02:09:47.900]   Which might have been a problem. Why didn't it? They did seem like they did the hard part,
[02:09:47.900 --> 02:09:52.220]   but they did the hard part. They did the hard part. Bosch, I thought it was really cool. Bosch
[02:09:52.220 --> 02:09:56.300]   put money into it, but I guess I gather what's happened is that Bosch's startup platform,
[02:09:56.300 --> 02:10:01.340]   the money's run out. Mayfield says, "We're not going to go anywhere. They've got these genius
[02:10:01.340 --> 02:10:06.140]   guys and gals working there. I think they've got a really interesting product. But if you did
[02:10:06.140 --> 02:10:11.340]   put down money on a curry as I did, maybe because of our ads, you will be getting a refund."
[02:10:11.340 --> 02:10:15.500]   Which at least I respect that. A lot of kick starters, you put the money down,
[02:10:15.500 --> 02:10:18.220]   you get nothing. This one you're going to get. You consider all kick starters a donation,
[02:10:18.220 --> 02:10:20.940]   a non-refundable donation. You may not get it back.
[02:10:20.940 --> 02:10:26.460]   Yeah. So, Curry says, Mayfield Robotics says they're pausing production. They're going to do a full
[02:10:26.460 --> 02:10:27.820]   refund. That's fine.
[02:10:27.820 --> 02:10:32.620]   But I hope that they continue. Are personal robots like when do we think there'll be a
[02:10:32.620 --> 02:10:37.820]   personal general robot that would be worth buying? A dishwasher is a robot in a way.
[02:10:37.820 --> 02:10:41.500]   I think we're a long way off from like C3PO.
[02:10:41.500 --> 02:10:42.140]   No.
[02:10:42.140 --> 02:10:45.980]   Anything that follows you around and does stuff for you, because maybe Alexa to a certain extent
[02:10:45.980 --> 02:10:47.340]   is a general robot.
[02:10:47.340 --> 02:10:53.900]   Yeah. So, what if I robots, which makes Roombas, what if they built something like this on top of
[02:10:53.900 --> 02:10:58.380]   a Roomba? It would have if it cleaned your floor, walked around, and was kind of like a Google
[02:10:58.380 --> 02:11:03.100]   assistant. That'd be amazing. Yeah, I think I easily put Alexa in and sort of follow you around
[02:11:03.100 --> 02:11:03.900]   like a speaker. Yes.
[02:11:03.900 --> 02:11:08.220]   It'd be like a Sony speaker, but I'm saying you had an arm on it. And you can say, go find my keys
[02:11:08.220 --> 02:11:12.300]   and go find your keys and bring them to you. Or like, again, go feed the cat.
[02:11:12.300 --> 02:11:20.060]   Yeah. Like that kind of stuff where a robot could be in your home doing tasks that it wasn't
[02:11:20.060 --> 02:11:21.900]   originally programmed to you that you trained it to do.
[02:11:21.900 --> 02:11:25.420]   So, how long before when you say go feed the cat, it comes back with the dead cat and says,
[02:11:25.420 --> 02:11:28.060]   who do you want me to feed it to? How long before it doesn't do that?
[02:11:28.060 --> 02:11:31.740]   How would you like me to prepare the cat? Yeah.
[02:11:31.740 --> 02:11:37.100]   Fried microwave? Okay. The cats be frosting in the microwave.
[02:11:37.100 --> 02:11:41.820]   We just lost all the cat fans. I do as a horrible future, but I didn't, I did not anticipate that.
[02:11:41.820 --> 02:11:44.060]   Oh my god. Oh my god. Feed the cat.
[02:11:44.060 --> 02:11:47.740]   Squit six, seven. Feed the cat.
[02:11:47.740 --> 02:11:51.180]   To whom should I feed the cat? To whom should I feed the cat?
[02:11:52.220 --> 02:11:56.780]   And so a show title. All right, ladies and gentlemen,
[02:11:56.780 --> 02:12:01.500]   so we had to do the show until we got the title. We got the title.
[02:12:01.500 --> 02:12:05.340]   And that's the official rules of Twit is that we now can conclude the episode.
[02:12:05.340 --> 02:12:06.300]   Sure.
[02:12:06.300 --> 02:12:07.340]   Give the good call.
[02:12:07.340 --> 02:12:11.100]   Yeah, it's a good call. Very good. Good call back. That's a really good serve man.
[02:12:11.100 --> 02:12:11.900]   Serve mankind.
[02:12:11.900 --> 02:12:13.900]   Yeah. What a great episode. That's my favorite.
[02:12:13.900 --> 02:12:17.340]   That's spoiler episode ever. It's a cookbook.
[02:12:20.140 --> 02:12:22.220]   Why do I think that was childhoods end and not?
[02:12:22.220 --> 02:12:25.260]   It was it was a toilet.
[02:12:25.260 --> 02:12:26.220]   It was just a animal.
[02:12:26.220 --> 02:12:31.500]   It's kind of similar ending though. Wasn't it Zora? Yeah. Okay.
[02:12:31.500 --> 02:12:36.860]   I now I've spoiled two things. So anybody want to talk about infinity war?
[02:12:36.860 --> 02:12:38.700]   Anything you want to spoil here?
[02:12:38.700 --> 02:12:40.460]   Not really.
[02:12:40.460 --> 02:12:43.980]   We did that last time. We clicked and the show was over. Everybody dissolved.
[02:12:43.980 --> 02:12:48.380]   It was awesome. Jason Calcanes, you must never dissolve. You must come back.
[02:12:48.380 --> 02:12:50.860]   You don't have to bring champagne, but it's okay if you do.
[02:12:50.860 --> 02:12:54.380]   How's your doge coin? Did you invest? Do you get it?
[02:12:54.380 --> 02:12:55.500]   You know, I'm getting early.
[02:12:55.500 --> 02:12:59.020]   I had some doge coin and I had some Bitcoin that my system bought and then that
[02:12:59.020 --> 02:13:03.420]   you became. No, that exchange got hacked and everything was gone.
[02:13:03.420 --> 02:13:05.420]   Oh, no, you lost your money. Was it gocks?
[02:13:05.420 --> 02:13:06.300]   Was it not gocks?
[02:13:06.300 --> 02:13:07.980]   No, it was another one at the same time.
[02:13:07.980 --> 02:13:08.460]   Oh, Lord.
[02:13:08.460 --> 02:13:14.220]   Look at my wife bought some cryptocurrency, but I actually think Bitcoin zero.
[02:13:14.220 --> 02:13:16.700]   That's like, yeah, you know, it's not a good investment.
[02:13:16.700 --> 02:13:17.980]   It's great that it hasn't been hacked.
[02:13:17.980 --> 02:13:19.580]   What are the fundamentals? That's the question.
[02:13:19.580 --> 02:13:22.860]   There is no use case that's emerged in five years.
[02:13:22.860 --> 02:13:24.300]   What about blockchain in general?
[02:13:24.300 --> 02:13:26.620]   You know, overblown.
[02:13:26.620 --> 02:13:27.100]   Yeah.
[02:13:27.100 --> 02:13:30.060]   Probably like, I mean, we have great databases that are fast.
[02:13:30.060 --> 02:13:36.700]   The number of use cases that need a public decentralized ledger,
[02:13:36.700 --> 02:13:41.100]   like it's a fun thing to be like, yeah, we'll put Uber and eBay on that,
[02:13:41.100 --> 02:13:42.940]   but it's like, but that makes no sense.
[02:13:42.940 --> 02:13:43.260]   Right.
[02:13:43.260 --> 02:13:44.620]   It doesn't provide any value.
[02:13:44.620 --> 02:13:47.980]   I don't need every ride on a public ledger that creates more problems.
[02:13:47.980 --> 02:13:48.700]   That's worth, right?
[02:13:48.700 --> 02:13:49.420]   Yeah.
[02:13:49.420 --> 02:13:54.780]   So I think it's one of those things where people got very excited about a technology like VR.
[02:13:54.780 --> 02:13:57.900]   It reminds me of the early days of VR in the 90s where people like,
[02:13:57.900 --> 02:14:01.020]   oh my God, can you imagine you're going to flow through the Yahoo catalog?
[02:14:01.020 --> 02:14:04.780]   Like, you know, you're going to be pulling out photos and you open up a folder,
[02:14:04.780 --> 02:14:08.060]   a photos and we could all walk around the photo and then jump into the photos.
[02:14:08.060 --> 02:14:11.500]   Like, oh, okay, but that doesn't sound actually that cool.
[02:14:11.500 --> 02:14:11.820]   Why?
[02:14:11.820 --> 02:14:14.300]   Like I can hit the next button and go through a gallery.
[02:14:14.300 --> 02:14:17.900]   I'm like, I'm going to go through a lot of the things that I'm going to do.
[02:14:17.900 --> 02:14:19.740]   I'm going to go through a lot of the things that I'm going to do.
[02:14:19.740 --> 02:14:22.940]   I'm going to go through a lot of the things that I'm going to do.
[02:14:22.940 --> 02:14:26.460]   I'm going to go through a lot of the things that I'm going to do.
[02:14:26.460 --> 02:14:28.780]   I'm going to go through a lot of the things that I'm going to do.
[02:14:28.780 --> 02:14:31.180]   I'm going to go through a lot of the things that I'm going to do.
[02:14:31.180 --> 02:14:33.740]   I'm going to go through a lot of the things that I'm going to do.
[02:14:33.740 --> 02:14:36.220]   I'm going to go through a lot of the things that I'm going to do.
[02:14:36.220 --> 02:14:38.460]   I'm going to go through a lot of the things that I'm going to do.
[02:14:38.460 --> 02:14:40.460]   I'm going to go through a lot of the things that I'm going to do.
[02:14:40.460 --> 02:14:45.260]   I'm going to go through a lot of the things that I'm going to do.
[02:14:45.260 --> 02:14:47.260]   I'm going to go through a lot of the things that I'm going to do.
[02:14:47.260 --> 02:14:49.820]   I'm going to go through a lot of the things that I'm going to do.
[02:14:49.820 --> 02:14:52.620]   I'm going to go through a lot of the things that I'm going to do.
[02:14:52.620 --> 02:14:55.180]   I'm going to go through a lot of the things that I'm going to do.
[02:14:55.180 --> 02:14:57.980]   I'm going to go through a lot of the things that I'm going to do.
[02:14:57.980 --> 02:15:00.540]   I'm going to go through a lot of the things that I'm going to do.
[02:15:00.540 --> 02:15:03.020]   I'm going to go through a lot of the things that I'm going to do.
[02:15:03.020 --> 02:15:05.900]   I'm going to go through a lot of the things that I'm going to do.
[02:15:05.900 --> 02:15:07.820]   I'm going to go through a lot of the things that I'm going to do.
[02:15:07.820 --> 02:15:09.820]   I'm going to go through a lot of the things that I'm going to do.
[02:15:10.300 --> 02:15:13.420]   It is amazing how many people I review it over there.
[02:15:13.420 --> 02:15:16.140]   I have 700 reviews. Can you click over to it?
[02:15:16.140 --> 02:15:17.660]   How do you see it over there?
[02:15:17.660 --> 02:15:18.380]   Yeah.
[02:15:18.380 --> 02:15:19.180]   No, it doesn't.
[02:15:19.180 --> 02:15:20.460]   I just got to go to Audible.
[02:15:20.460 --> 02:15:21.180]   You've got to go to Audible.
[02:15:21.180 --> 02:15:23.820]   Nothing has 700 reviews.
[02:15:23.820 --> 02:15:24.860]   It's unbelievable.
[02:15:24.860 --> 02:15:29.340]   The thing is when you make a book, you should make it under six or seven hours so people
[02:15:29.340 --> 02:15:32.140]   can finish it because at the end it prompts them to rate it.
[02:15:32.140 --> 02:15:37.500]   The problem is most people write books that are too long.
[02:15:37.500 --> 02:15:38.540]   Nobody ever gets or so.
[02:15:38.540 --> 02:15:39.340]   How many?
[02:15:39.340 --> 02:15:40.940]   You prompt people in the book to rate it.
[02:15:40.940 --> 02:15:44.460]   No, at the end it says "rate it" but I figured out the trick.
[02:15:44.460 --> 02:15:46.780]   I put my email address in the book.
[02:15:46.780 --> 02:15:48.460]   626 5-star ratings.
[02:15:48.460 --> 02:15:48.700]   Crazy, right?
[02:15:48.700 --> 02:15:49.980]   106 4-stars.
[02:15:49.980 --> 02:15:51.020]   We didn't pay anybody to do that.
[02:15:51.020 --> 02:15:53.660]   And then the rest a total of what 42,
[02:15:53.660 --> 02:15:55.260]   3, 2, and 1 starts.
[02:15:55.260 --> 02:15:55.980]   It's just haters.
[02:15:55.980 --> 02:15:56.940]   Those are people I fired.
[02:15:56.940 --> 02:15:57.740]   They're people you fired.
[02:15:57.740 --> 02:15:58.220]   Right?
[02:15:58.220 --> 02:15:58.620]   Look at this.
[02:15:58.620 --> 02:15:59.740]   It is incredible.
[02:15:59.740 --> 02:15:59.740]   It is.
[02:15:59.740 --> 02:16:01.020]   Let me play just a little.
[02:16:01.020 --> 02:16:01.740]   I'm going to play a little bit.
[02:16:01.740 --> 02:16:04.620]   Just people should listen because he reads it so well.
[02:16:04.620 --> 02:16:07.580]   All of the other books out there and some are great.
[02:16:07.580 --> 02:16:10.540]   Try to explain to you how people made money in real estate
[02:16:10.540 --> 02:16:12.140]   by mastering the art of the deal
[02:16:12.140 --> 02:16:15.020]   or by getting the right people on the bus and the wrong ones off.
[02:16:15.020 --> 02:16:17.900]   But they are largely historical documents now.
[02:16:17.900 --> 02:16:19.980]   This is right at the beginning.
[02:16:19.980 --> 02:16:20.780]   And you know what's great?
[02:16:20.780 --> 02:16:23.420]   That was your audition, right?
[02:16:23.420 --> 02:16:23.980]   Yeah.
[02:16:23.980 --> 02:16:24.540]   Yeah.
[02:16:24.540 --> 02:16:27.420]   And I listened to that and I go, "Yeah, you got to have Jason say it."
[02:16:27.420 --> 02:16:27.980]   Yeah, of course.
[02:16:27.980 --> 02:16:29.100]   It's his voice.
[02:16:29.100 --> 02:16:30.620]   How to invest in technology startups,
[02:16:30.620 --> 02:16:32.300]   timeless advice from an angel investor.
[02:16:32.300 --> 02:16:34.780]   Her turned $100,000 into $100 million.
[02:16:34.780 --> 02:16:35.580]   You're worth that.
[02:16:35.580 --> 02:16:36.060]   You're worth that.
[02:16:36.060 --> 02:16:37.420]   Hey, that's a lie.
[02:16:37.420 --> 02:16:38.460]   You're worth like 10 times.
[02:16:38.460 --> 02:16:39.020]   We'll see what happens.
[02:16:39.020 --> 02:16:41.100]   You're in a six-coma club.
[02:16:41.100 --> 02:16:44.220]   You're in the three-coma club.
[02:16:44.220 --> 02:16:46.300]   No, no, it's going to take some more time.
[02:16:46.300 --> 02:16:46.940]   Two commas.
[02:16:46.940 --> 02:16:48.860]   I thought you drove up into McLaren.
[02:16:48.860 --> 02:16:50.140]   No, that's too Dushy.
[02:16:50.140 --> 02:16:54.140]   Mike Elgin, you got to love Mike.
[02:16:54.140 --> 02:16:55.660]   He is one of my favorite people.
[02:16:55.660 --> 02:16:56.540]   Elgin.com.
[02:16:56.540 --> 02:16:59.980]   And of course, if you get a chance, go to gastronomad.net.
[02:16:59.980 --> 02:17:02.540]   Click on experiences and go to Prosecco,
[02:17:02.540 --> 02:17:05.340]   go to Morocco, go to Barcelona,
[02:17:05.340 --> 02:17:07.020]   take advantage of these experiences.
[02:17:07.020 --> 02:17:09.100]   Mexico City's coming up in the winter.
[02:17:09.100 --> 02:17:09.660]   Yep.
[02:17:09.660 --> 02:17:10.620]   Oh, man.
[02:17:10.620 --> 02:17:11.900]   What a life.
[02:17:11.900 --> 02:17:12.700]   What a life.
[02:17:12.700 --> 02:17:13.340]   What a life.
[02:17:13.340 --> 02:17:13.980]   What a life.
[02:17:13.980 --> 02:17:17.340]   And I would invite everyone to subscribe to my newsletter,
[02:17:17.340 --> 02:17:19.660]   Mike's List, Elgin.com/Mike's List.
[02:17:19.660 --> 02:17:20.780]   Oh, I forgot.
[02:17:20.780 --> 02:17:21.260]   Yeah.
[02:17:21.260 --> 02:17:22.780]   Mike, last time you were here,
[02:17:22.780 --> 02:17:24.780]   you mentioned that you were going to put all your Chrome
[02:17:24.780 --> 02:17:25.740]   extensions on last.
[02:17:25.740 --> 02:17:27.340]   Yes, I did.
[02:17:27.340 --> 02:17:29.020]   And this is a work in progress.
[02:17:29.020 --> 02:17:30.300]   I'm going to work up to 100.
[02:17:30.300 --> 02:17:32.380]   And this is a living document.
[02:17:32.380 --> 02:17:34.380]   So I have all the Chromebook nerds
[02:17:34.380 --> 02:17:37.500]   and Chrome extension nerds giving me advice.
[02:17:37.500 --> 02:17:38.700]   Is that a Chromebook there?
[02:17:38.700 --> 02:17:39.100]   It is.
[02:17:39.100 --> 02:17:39.900]   It is a Pixelbook.
[02:17:39.900 --> 02:17:41.340]   It's a nice Google Pixelbook.
[02:17:41.340 --> 02:17:41.740]   Oh, that's a new Pixelbook.
[02:17:41.740 --> 02:17:42.300]   Oh, it's a Pixelbook.
[02:17:42.300 --> 02:17:42.940]   That's a 6book.
[02:17:42.940 --> 02:17:44.300]   I spent $2,000 on--
[02:17:44.300 --> 02:17:45.900]   No, this is the 16 gig one.
[02:17:45.900 --> 02:17:46.700]   This is the catalog.
[02:17:46.700 --> 02:17:47.260]   Top of the line.
[02:17:47.260 --> 02:17:48.140]   I got the pencil.
[02:17:48.140 --> 02:17:48.780]   I got the pen.
[02:17:48.780 --> 02:17:50.140]   I got a really nice leather case.
[02:17:50.140 --> 02:17:50.700]   I got all this.
[02:17:50.700 --> 02:17:51.340]   It was $2,000.
[02:17:51.340 --> 02:17:52.700]   But you know what?
[02:17:52.700 --> 02:17:53.260]   It's awesome.
[02:17:53.260 --> 02:17:55.980]   When you load 20 Chrome browser windows, it doesn't crash.
[02:17:55.980 --> 02:17:56.780]   20.
[02:17:56.780 --> 02:17:57.740]   I load 50.
[02:17:57.740 --> 02:17:58.540]   Yeah.
[02:17:58.540 --> 02:18:01.900]   I can have 150 tabs open.
[02:18:01.900 --> 02:18:03.580]   Because it's got a lot of memory.
[02:18:03.580 --> 02:18:04.620]   So you recommend that one?
[02:18:04.620 --> 02:18:06.140]   Is that the best Pixelbook you've got?
[02:18:06.140 --> 02:18:07.500]   It absolutely is the best Chromebook
[02:18:07.500 --> 02:18:08.300]   of any kind of device.
[02:18:08.300 --> 02:18:08.620]   Most expensive.
[02:18:08.620 --> 02:18:09.100]   Yeah.
[02:18:09.100 --> 02:18:13.020]   It's the most expensive version of the least expensive platform.
[02:18:13.020 --> 02:18:13.500]   But you know what?
[02:18:13.500 --> 02:18:14.860]   You've got to look at it.
[02:18:14.860 --> 02:18:16.220]   Really, it's light.
[02:18:16.220 --> 02:18:17.020]   It's really--
[02:18:17.020 --> 02:18:18.940]   I have the-- they actually designed it very well.
[02:18:18.940 --> 02:18:19.740]   The first version.
[02:18:19.740 --> 02:18:20.140]   Really?
[02:18:20.140 --> 02:18:21.340]   Oh, no, it's nicer.
[02:18:21.340 --> 02:18:21.820]   It's so much nicer.
[02:18:21.820 --> 02:18:22.300]   They've really made it here.
[02:18:22.300 --> 02:18:23.420]   And it has a touch screen?
[02:18:23.420 --> 02:18:23.900]   Yeah.
[02:18:23.900 --> 02:18:24.300]   Yeah.
[02:18:24.300 --> 02:18:24.940]   And Android apps.
[02:18:24.940 --> 02:18:25.740]   It's a thingy beauty.
[02:18:25.740 --> 02:18:26.220]   It's an anode.
[02:18:26.220 --> 02:18:27.100]   And now with--
[02:18:27.100 --> 02:18:29.340]   Does it have four LTE on it?
[02:18:29.340 --> 02:18:29.740]   No.
[02:18:29.740 --> 02:18:30.540]   They didn't do that.
[02:18:30.540 --> 02:18:31.500]   They did that on the last one.
[02:18:31.500 --> 02:18:32.060]   It was so nice.
[02:18:32.060 --> 02:18:33.420]   I think the reason they didn't do that is they figure,
[02:18:33.420 --> 02:18:35.020]   well, everybody's got a hotspot on their phone.
[02:18:35.020 --> 02:18:35.020]   Yeah.
[02:18:35.020 --> 02:18:35.820]   And no one wants another one.
[02:18:35.820 --> 02:18:36.060]   That's another one.
[02:18:36.060 --> 02:18:36.780]   Another subscription.
[02:18:36.780 --> 02:18:36.780]   Right.
[02:18:36.780 --> 02:18:38.300]   Yeah.
[02:18:38.300 --> 02:18:39.180]   But super thin.
[02:18:39.180 --> 02:18:41.580]   One thing you might be interested in the next edition
[02:18:41.580 --> 02:18:43.900]   of that, I think, is '69 of Chrome OS.
[02:18:43.900 --> 02:18:45.580]   You'll be able to run Linux apps as well.
[02:18:45.580 --> 02:18:46.300]   Oh, wow.
[02:18:46.300 --> 02:18:46.780]   Yep.
[02:18:46.780 --> 02:18:48.380]   And Windows and all kinds of stuff.
[02:18:48.380 --> 02:18:49.660]   It's kind of an interesting mix.
[02:18:49.660 --> 02:18:50.380]   Yeah.
[02:18:50.380 --> 02:18:52.460]   And of course, Android apps run far better
[02:18:52.460 --> 02:18:53.820]   than I thought they would.
[02:18:53.820 --> 02:18:54.140]   Yeah.
[02:18:54.140 --> 02:18:54.860]   It's pretty amazing.
[02:18:54.860 --> 02:18:57.420]   The trick is finding one that uses it appropriately.
[02:18:57.420 --> 02:18:58.780]   Instead of looking like a phone.
[02:18:58.780 --> 02:19:00.140]   Many of them do.
[02:19:00.140 --> 02:19:00.940]   Now they go full screen.
[02:19:00.940 --> 02:19:01.420]   Oh, that's good.
[02:19:01.420 --> 02:19:02.220]   It's just fantastic.
[02:19:02.220 --> 02:19:03.580]   Oh, so you have the 16 gig.
[02:19:03.580 --> 02:19:03.980]   Yes.
[02:19:03.980 --> 02:19:04.620]   16 gigs.
[02:19:04.620 --> 02:19:05.180]   It's fine.
[02:19:05.180 --> 02:19:06.620]   It's fine right now.
[02:19:06.620 --> 02:19:06.780]   Yeah.
[02:19:06.780 --> 02:19:08.620]   Actually, you should have bought it on a prime day.
[02:19:08.620 --> 02:19:09.900]   They had a pretty good deal on it.
[02:19:09.900 --> 02:19:11.180]   Actually, it might have not been the high end,
[02:19:11.180 --> 02:19:11.420]   though.
[02:19:11.420 --> 02:19:13.260]   I think it was the low end.
[02:19:13.260 --> 02:19:16.460]   Mike's List, subscribe at elgin.com.
[02:19:16.460 --> 02:19:18.780]   And one of the first things you'll get, probably,
[02:19:18.780 --> 02:19:20.220]   is that Chrome.
[02:19:20.220 --> 02:19:21.020]   I will put it--
[02:19:21.020 --> 02:19:23.820]   I will put it in the list next week.
[02:19:23.820 --> 02:19:26.940]   But the list is really-- this is a labor of love.
[02:19:26.940 --> 02:19:27.820]   Been doing it for a long time.
[02:19:27.820 --> 02:19:32.620]   This is the irresponsible, dangerous fringe of technology.
[02:19:32.620 --> 02:19:34.860]   This is the fun stuff, the newsletter,
[02:19:34.860 --> 02:19:37.260]   is just all the craziest stuff that happened in the week.
[02:19:37.260 --> 02:19:37.900]   Nice.
[02:19:37.900 --> 02:19:41.740]   And so if you love the show, you will also love "Rit List."
[02:19:41.740 --> 02:19:44.380]   It is kind of like the written version of the show.
[02:19:44.380 --> 02:19:45.100]   Yeah.
[02:19:45.100 --> 02:19:45.580]   Yeah.
[02:19:45.580 --> 02:19:46.540]   I think you're right.
[02:19:46.540 --> 02:19:49.820]   If you enjoy "Twit," you can come be in our studio audience.
[02:19:49.820 --> 02:19:50.860]   Two whole people did.

[02:19:52.860 --> 02:19:54.380]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:19:54.380 --> 02:19:54.860]   That's all right.
[02:19:54.860 --> 02:19:56.780]   You know, some days are busier than other days.
[02:19:56.780 --> 02:19:57.820]   It's really great to have you.
[02:19:57.820 --> 02:19:59.020]   We'll put a chair out for you.
[02:19:59.020 --> 02:20:01.260]   But you do have to email tickets at twit.tv.
[02:20:01.260 --> 02:20:02.380]   Chris is visiting from Sydney.
[02:20:02.380 --> 02:20:03.020]   Welcome, Chris.
[02:20:03.020 --> 02:20:04.780]   It's nice to have you.
[02:20:04.780 --> 02:20:05.820]   All the way from Australia.
[02:20:05.820 --> 02:20:07.660]   We get a lot of Australians.
[02:20:07.660 --> 02:20:08.300]   Hey, who--
[02:20:08.300 --> 02:20:09.180]   I just got back.

[02:20:09.900 --> 02:20:10.460]   Oh.
[02:20:10.460 --> 02:20:11.020]   Oh, Sydney.
[02:20:11.020 --> 02:20:11.820]   I love Sydney.
[02:20:11.820 --> 02:20:12.460]   Yeah.
[02:20:12.460 --> 02:20:13.580]   I went to Tetsuyah.
[02:20:13.580 --> 02:20:14.060]   Oh, my god.
[02:20:14.060 --> 02:20:15.740]   This Japanese restaurant there, Michelin starred.
[02:20:15.740 --> 02:20:16.060]   Really?
[02:20:16.060 --> 02:20:16.780]   Unbelievable.
[02:20:16.780 --> 02:20:17.500]   In Sydney.
[02:20:17.500 --> 02:20:19.660]   Because we're going next year as well.
[02:20:19.660 --> 02:20:19.980]   Incredible.
[02:20:19.980 --> 02:20:20.540]   In Australia.
[02:20:20.540 --> 02:20:21.740]   It's so great.
[02:20:21.740 --> 02:20:22.220]   Yeah.
[02:20:22.220 --> 02:20:23.100]   The food is amazing.
[02:20:23.100 --> 02:20:24.620]   The people are amazing.
[02:20:24.620 --> 02:20:26.300]   I'm going to let you two talk amongst each other.
[02:20:26.300 --> 02:20:30.380]   Well, I mentioned that you can also watch the stream at no cost
[02:20:30.380 --> 02:20:30.740]   to you.

[02:20:46.940 --> 02:20:50.620]   And so it's kind of like the commentary going on behind the scene.
[02:20:50.620 --> 02:20:52.620]   But as always, with everything we do,
[02:20:52.620 --> 02:20:55.260]   we make on-demand versions of our shows available at the website.

[02:21:03.740 --> 02:21:06.780]   So you'll have something to listen to.

[02:21:14.540 --> 02:21:15.340]   What a pioneer.
[02:21:15.340 --> 02:21:16.700]   You basically made space.
[02:21:16.700 --> 02:21:16.860]   A pioneer.
[02:21:16.860 --> 02:21:17.420]   Old guy.
[02:21:17.420 --> 02:21:17.900]   Same thing.
[02:21:17.900 --> 02:21:18.300]   That's it.
[02:21:18.300 --> 02:21:20.060]   Classic.
[02:21:20.060 --> 02:21:23.100]   But I've been saying the same thing for almost 700 episodes,
[02:21:23.100 --> 02:21:24.460]   more than 700 episodes.
[02:21:24.460 --> 02:21:26.460]   Another twit is in the can.
[02:21:26.460 --> 02:21:28.300]   This is amazing.
[02:21:28.300 --> 02:21:29.180]   Salud.
[02:21:29.180 --> 02:21:29.740]   Salud.
[02:21:29.740 --> 02:21:31.180]   Salud.
