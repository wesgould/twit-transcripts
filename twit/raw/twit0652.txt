[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.400]   Great to see you, Leo. Thanks for coming. On short notice, we had that we had a one of
[00:02:29.400 --> 00:02:33.920]   our panel fell out because of Larry and Jydis. Every Sunday, I have a go-back by the door.
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.800]   You're ready to go. So just give me a call and I'm here.

[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:44.840]   advantage of you every bit we can while you're here. Also joining us is great to have you,
[00:02:44.840 --> 00:02:51.280]   Ashley Asquetha from CNET and I see you all over the place. Where's your glasses?
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:58.120]   You know what? I have a scratch in the lenses. So I mean, I see 20 pairs behind you. Oh,
[00:02:58.120 --> 00:03:01.640]   my glasses are here. I just want to rest my eyes.
[00:03:01.640 --> 00:03:06.880]   Rest your eyes. Some days like because I need them for distance. And so this is right in
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.280]   front of me. So I just I'm like, oh, I'm just going to rest my eyes today.
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.360]   New show tomorrow, daily. How's that going? Oh, that's not new. That's old and it got
[00:03:15.360 --> 00:03:23.800]   canceled a year and a half ago. You can see I'm really keeping up. But I will say there
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:30.640]   is something new launching this week on CNET that actually tomorrow morning. So you keep
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:34.280]   an eye on my Twitter handle. Yeah, you're just looking into the future. It's totally
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:41.960]   fine. You're just testing me, Leo. I was reading your bio on CNET's page. It says currently
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:47.160]   hosting the new show tomorrow daily. You might want to get them to update that. I know.
[00:03:47.160 --> 00:03:52.480]   I have to like email it. I think to have that fixed. Like I'm not really sure even how to
[00:03:52.480 --> 00:03:57.280]   how to fix that. I have no idea. Jimmy, still your husband though, right? He is still my
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:04:02.200]   husband. You still play Diablo three. I played Diablo three. Yeah, that is also true. You
[00:04:02.200 --> 00:04:06.760]   greatly enjoy karaoke. I still do greatly enjoy karaoke. And I believe you're largely
[00:04:06.760 --> 00:04:12.560]   comprised of ham and cheese. Yes. Okay, just checking. So you're it. We'll just we'll
[00:04:12.560 --> 00:04:18.640]   blue pencil this year. Real quickly, just cross that currently hosting the new show
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:24.760]   tomorrow. We just read that. Currently hosting a new show that launches tomorrow on CNET.
[00:04:24.760 --> 00:04:29.480]   And you're being cagey. You can't tell us the title or anything. Well, like I'm just
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:33.440]   scared because if I do, I don't know if I'm allowed to. Like we haven't really like
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:37.120]   announced it. So I think we're just posting it tomorrow to see what happens. So where
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.880]   should we go? Just cNET.com will be right on the front page here. Well, I would I actually
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:47.760]   this might give away a little bit of it, but I would go to the roadshow.com. You know what?
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:52.080]   I saw that on Instagram. I know that's what you're doing. Yeah, I'm doing something fun
[00:04:52.080 --> 00:04:56.000]   with roadshow. And I'm excited about it, actually, because it's something I'm really
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   into and. We love Tim Stevens. And I love him. And I love him. Steven was on the show
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.480]   last week. He's awesome. Yeah. We've been talking about this idea for months at this
[00:05:06.480 --> 00:05:10.960]   point. And so now we finally kind of got everything together. So I think it'll launch
[00:05:10.960 --> 00:05:19.160]   to our around 10 a.m. Pacific. Nice. Can't wait. Are you into cars? I I'm not a gearhead.
[00:05:19.160 --> 00:05:26.760]   However, I took Otter shop in high school. I worked on my own my very first car with
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:32.240]   my grandpa. We bought a shell of a car from somebody in the green sheet. And we worked
[00:05:32.240 --> 00:05:36.600]   on it together and replaced the transmission and like the interiors and all that stuff.
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:44.320]   So I really love cars, but I would say I am not super deep into them the way that a lot
[00:05:44.320 --> 00:05:49.120]   of car people are. Yeah, you have to be careful when you're doing a show like that.
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:53.320]   Because it's like if you're on a gaming show and you say, no, I'm a gamer, they'll go well.
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:59.560]   Oh, really? Oh, really prove it. Let me ask you a question then. Yeah. Exactly. So it's I
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:06.760]   wouldn't call myself a gear like a car person, but I do love cars. So you're a car person.
[00:06:06.760 --> 00:06:13.280]   I would put myself in any normal world you'd be a car person. Yeah. Also with a Sam
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:18.960]   mesh, Kovich, Tuck tech culture editor, tech culture, Vulture and ours. Technica. Hello,
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:25.840]   Sam. Good afternoon. Everybody has everybody been doing their huts and hikes and fortues
[00:06:25.840 --> 00:06:30.560]   and I don't know what else what else does it is super bowl Sunday. We're starting the
[00:06:30.560 --> 00:06:34.200]   show a little bit early so that we can get out of here just in time to see Justin Timberlake.
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:38.400]   Oh, goodness. Well, if his new album is any indication, you can probably just skip that
[00:06:38.400 --> 00:06:42.560]   and watch the puppy bowl instead. Yeah, just skip it. Just just really.
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:45.880]   Puppy bowl. I mean, puppy bowls kind of an easy default. Anyway, you'd have to essentially
[00:06:45.880 --> 00:06:51.840]   make pet sounds to get me to tune away from the puppy bowl. I have what I call the dog
[00:06:51.840 --> 00:06:56.600]   to gone, which is my two younger dogs that just fight each other all the time. They run
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:00.440]   around and bite each other in the neck because they're going to go who will enter one will
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:04.840]   tool and only one will emerge from the one that emerges to be dressed by Tom Brady. So
[00:07:04.840 --> 00:07:09.400]   just yeah, yeah, exactly. By the way, UFC, if you're listening, you can totally have
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:13.760]   that idea for a very low fee and you can just email me. It's fine. I'll sell it to you for
[00:07:13.760 --> 00:07:17.200]   cheap. Actually animal planet wants it. So the next time there's a big UFC match, they
[00:07:17.200 --> 00:07:22.400]   can counter program it. Yeah, they can't program. You get the dog to God dog fighting is illegal.
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:27.200]   They're not fighting. I say they're they're playing their puppies. One of them's three.
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:32.840]   The other ones a year old and they just like they roll each other over like hard. They
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:36.720]   run into each other. It's like watching giraffes fight because I have two Italian Greyhounds
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:43.680]   have really long necks and they like hit each other their heads. Like it's just a show coming
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:49.120]   out tomorrow. Is that just your two dogs just getting into cuddle that? If I could if I could
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:53.280]   sell that if I if I could sell it to see that I probably would would do that.
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:08:04.240]   So remembers 1998's Super Bowl the first dot com ad ever. Does anybody remember? Was that
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:08.400]   one of the pets.com has. That's not com was early, but not then. This was even before
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:14.240]   pets.com. It was the only one on that Super Bowl Super Bowl. X, X, X two. Is it? Would
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:19.440]   you like to unfurl this knowledge for us? A ye old man on top. I shall. It was a company
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:26.040]   that's still around called auto by tell. Oh, you're kidding. I would not have ever guessed
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:32.560]   that. Yeah. But then there was the voice of Leonard Nimoy to amazing. Yeah, you want to
[00:08:32.560 --> 00:08:37.560]   that spot. You want to watch it? Here we go. Let's see. This is the first dot and it was
[00:08:37.560 --> 00:08:42.920]   I remember seeing this and going, wow, we've really come again. Time. People are wondering
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:48.680]   why does car buying have to be such a pain? Okay, that's enough of that. This is definitely
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:54.240]   a boy. Wow. Yeah, when does he man swoop in? They spent money on the ad placement, but
[00:08:54.240 --> 00:09:01.960]   then obviously not on the ad. But the big the big Super Bowl, the dot combo was in 2000
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:07.360]   right before the bust. And that's why you remember pets.com because they were on them.
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:17.200]   E trade hot jobs. How many of these are still around? K force lifeminders.com monster.com
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:24.480]   our beginning.com pets.com Webex and WebMD. Wow. You want to see the pets? And if I recall
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:30.200]   that the ads were fantastic, they were all there. Sure. They were amazing. Lots of money.
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:35.480]   Okay, you know, I got to go to a lot of stores to get what you like. I'll be back.
[00:09:35.480 --> 00:09:45.440]   Partly this is 17 years ago. We just this is the pets.com talking dog puppet. Little
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:51.480]   trip. Yeah, turtle. Yeah. The voice the voice of the pets.com dog comedian Michael Ian
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:56.480]   black whoa he beats the state and many other comedies ever since. This is why we have Sam
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:10:04.280]   Meshkovich on the show. Wow. That was it. The first and by the way, pets.com went out of
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:09.600]   business when people realized it cost way too much to send clay kitty litter through
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:17.040]   the mail. You know, it just like kitty litter worth 12 cents. It's $40 shipping. It's an
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:20.320]   interesting time of our lives. The biggest change, of course, is budgets. I mean, how
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:27.000]   much of that puppet cost? Ah, that's a good point because this year's Super Bowl. I think
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:33.800]   the ads are there in excess of two million, right? It's expensive. I'm curious what the
[00:10:33.800 --> 00:10:38.920]   day after stuff is. I feel like so this I feel like is the turning point of going online
[00:10:38.920 --> 00:10:43.920]   to watch the ads before they're on the Super Bowl. I just think so many companies have realized
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:48.400]   doing the band ad and getting those up online beforehand. I know I've already seen Danny
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:52.640]   DeVito smothered in chocolate on the internet. I know I've seen sprints attempt to make a
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:58.600]   cyborgish thing that makes sprint seem cool. You know, these things come out already. I
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:04.840]   don't need to watch the most obvious lopsided Super Bowl to come. Correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:11:04.840 --> 00:11:09.080]   future to see these ads. So I'll be curious. That's what I think is going to be the interesting
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:13.320]   fallout is how many people just rush to YouTube instead of watching the Super Bowl, especially
[00:11:13.320 --> 00:11:18.880]   if people don't care about East Coast versus East Coast. Super on the line.
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:25.040]   By the time this show is over, there are definitely going to be an angry mob coming to
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:32.480]   your house to get you for those. I'm just hoping that they try to climb the poles near
[00:11:32.480 --> 00:11:36.400]   my house. I don't know if you guys saw that apparently the city of Bill Delky. Yeah, they've
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:43.040]   been criss going all the polls. What? The city is going to catch on fire.
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:51.000]   So there will be a lot of .com ads on the Super Bowl this year, Super Bowl 52. This is from
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:59.560]   adagewicks.com website, right? They're competing directly against our former sponsor Squarespace.com.
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:05.040]   Squarespace has hired Keanu Reeves. Huh? Squarespace told us that it was too much to
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:09.760]   advertise on Twitch. So they're spending what must be upwards of $5 million on one
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:15.240]   ad on the Super Bowl, given Keanu's fee. Quick thing about Wix, if I may, I believe that
[00:12:15.240 --> 00:12:20.440]   was the URL of Windows Magazine's social network or what? Message. And then they got
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:24.840]   it? Yeah, because that was closed in like 2000 or something like that. Wix will save
[00:12:24.840 --> 00:12:28.920]   money instead of getting Keanu Reeves for their ad. They've got Rhett and Link. It's
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:35.280]   actually Rhett and Link might be more nowadays might be more expensive than Keanu Reeves.
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:42.600]   In 2017, they had Jason Statham and Gal Gadot. Nice. Before she blew up. Yeah. She's the
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:49.400]   best. Oh, she is Wonder Woman, right? Yeah. Still haven't seen that. HBO, Time. What?
[00:12:49.400 --> 00:12:54.640]   I know. Hold on. Let's just cancel this episode. No, no, no, no, no, no, no, I'm saving it.
[00:12:54.640 --> 00:12:59.560]   We're going to cut to all of Wonder Woman in its entirety. We're replaced with the day.
[00:12:59.560 --> 00:13:05.200]   HBO hasn't seen it. T-Mobile will buy a 60. That's twice as expensive, right? That's really
[00:13:05.200 --> 00:13:11.160]   expensive. Wow. Kerry Washington from Scandal will be somehow involved. We don't know how
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:15.560]   quick and loans, one of our sponsors, Rocket Mortgage. You're buying a Super Bowl as their
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:20.240]   first Super Bowl ad for three years. You should just play one of your ads. Yeah, I know.
[00:13:20.240 --> 00:13:24.000]   They just have me do that one. 60 seconds of you talking. You'll do it for $5 million.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:32.240]   There's T-Mobile bought a minute, Sprint bought two 15s, both featuring Evelyn, a robot. I'll
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:36.080]   be looking for that. Wendy's. Actually, I'm looking for there's one. There's a rap battle
[00:13:36.080 --> 00:13:44.480]   between Peter Dinklage of Game of Thrones, the imp-- That's a good ad versus Morgan Freeman,
[00:13:44.480 --> 00:13:50.160]   right? Yeah. Who's that for? It's Doritos and Mountain Dew. Oh, I was just testing you
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:54.400]   to see because sometimes these great ads, you remember the ad and you have no idea what it
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:14:00.800]   was an ad for. Yeah, no, it's a good one. I really love that one. Amazon's going to buy
[00:14:00.800 --> 00:14:05.280]   an ECHO ad, series of ECHO ads including-- Going to set off every ECHO in the nation. No,
[00:14:05.280 --> 00:14:13.600]   because we found out how they do it. Actually, I thought they were doing an inaudible tone or
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:17.680]   something over the A word when they did it because we can't say the A word because it will trigger
[00:14:17.680 --> 00:14:24.640]   your ECHO. But we have to try this. We're going to try this in editing. They take out--
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:30.880]   they notch the frequencies between, I think, was 3 and 6,000 kilohertz,
[00:14:30.880 --> 00:14:36.720]   which is enough to-- I'm not sure if they've taught the ECHO just ignore it if you don't hear it,
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:41.920]   or it's right where the human voice is. Or it's just-- For somehow, it's modifying it sufficiently
[00:14:41.920 --> 00:14:45.920]   that it will not, they say, trigger ECHO's. And then, you know, they don't-- Not only is it a bad
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:50.640]   PR, you know, black mark, right? They don't want to trigger ECHO's because imagine there's more
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:56.720]   than 100 million people watching. 100 million simultaneous requests to Amazon servers would not
[00:14:56.720 --> 00:15:02.560]   be good. And you're suddenly not paying attention to the ad. You're now like trying to shut off your
[00:15:02.560 --> 00:15:07.680]   Amazon and stuff. I'll tell you, it would be a genius promotion if they just had something where
[00:15:07.680 --> 00:15:13.440]   if you had a device and the buzz phrase played, then everyone got a coupon. Like that to me would
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:18.160]   be an amazing combination stress test and promotional stuff. Sure. Just giving you that one for free,
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:25.520]   guys. Yep. Here's my question. Are they able to tell who's watching the ad? Because if you are
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:29.840]   subscribers-- Oh, my God. Of course they do. If you have an ECHO, they know exactly who you are.
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:34.000]   What, you think Amazon is interested in personal data of how you live?
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.920]   They just are interested. I'll tell you why I don't believe they actually do that because
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:42.640]   they would have to stream that data back to Amazon. Right now, the way the ECHO and all these devices
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:47.520]   work, they're not communicating with a home office. They're just listening for a trigger
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:52.640]   word to match in their internal memory. And then anything said after the trigger word gets sent back.
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:58.800]   In order for them to know that you saw that ad, they'd have to actually be listening all the time.
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:03.520]   That would be so controversial. Well, they do a lot of controversial things.
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:08.880]   Well, I mean, who knows what's in that EULA in terms of what a Canon cannot pick up.
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:11.360]   Remember the fire-- Let's go scroll into that. Yeah, remember the fire phone.
[00:16:11.360 --> 00:16:15.440]   So the fire phone had a single button to either take a picture of a product--
[00:16:15.440 --> 00:16:19.200]   That's going to be Jeff Bezos'-- Remember the fire phone? Yeah, right.
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:24.640]   But the single button turned on the camera, the audio, the everything. So if you were taking a
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:27.440]   picture of something, it sent the audio-- Right. Right.
[00:16:27.440 --> 00:16:30.480]   --some of the number of seconds-- Boy, another reason not to get that phone.
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:35.040]   Right. Well, but I mean, the point is they didn't announce that. We had to figure that out.
[00:16:35.040 --> 00:16:40.400]   And so we don't know what they're doing. What we do know is there's 100% certainty that they could
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:45.120]   do that very easily. Whether they would choose or not do that, but they could do that.
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:49.120]   This ad looks trivial. This ad was a 90 second ad in the fourth quarter.
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:53.360]   So that's got to be like, that's a lot of money. Right. Well, they made a lot of money last
[00:16:53.360 --> 00:16:56.640]   quarter. So I mean, they can afford it. Yeah, we're talking about quarterly results in a bit,
[00:16:56.640 --> 00:17:01.600]   by the way. That's like, pocket change for Amazon. The spot was released last Wednesday. I,
[00:17:01.600 --> 00:17:08.480]   you know, that's-- To me, I wish they wouldn't. Yeah. Surprise us. But apparently, Bezos is in it.
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:16.880]   Amazon's A word has lost her voice. Yes. And Cardi B and Gordon Ramsay and other celebrities
[00:17:16.880 --> 00:17:21.120]   pitch in to do the voice. You wouldn't want Gordon Ramsay on your Amazon.
[00:17:21.120 --> 00:17:24.960]   Yeah. Mine mother was-- He is a cooking cook. Oh, look. I love her.
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:28.800]   Yeah, Rebel Wilson. Rebel Wilson. Couldn't remember her name.
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:34.160]   --is she-- My mother is obsessed with having the custom voices on any driving app that my mother
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:38.800]   uses, whatever custom voice she can have. She even had Snoop Dogg on her one of her driving apps for
[00:17:38.800 --> 00:17:41.600]   a while. Just she's like, I don't know who he is, but this is so fun.
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:47.440]   I love this. I think it turned after the next-- Street.
[00:17:47.440 --> 00:17:58.000]   Who now? Who will have an ad? Verizon. First time says 2011. The company declined to describe
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:03.680]   its plans further. Yes. Very secretive. Not disclosed agency, not disclosed creative,
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:08.080]   not disclosed. Nothing. Nothing. Just gonna pop up and say, "Who needs Verizon?" The end. Yeah.
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:15.360]   Verizon. Yeah. It's gonna be a USB chain to an ad executive that's gonna get it into the network
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:19.680]   at the last minute. Here it is. We got it. I just pulled it up to the Mac.
[00:18:19.680 --> 00:18:24.160]   I hope it doesn't have the guy from Silicon Valley. Those Verizon ads are driving me nuts.
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:28.320]   Aren't they? Yeah. I'm a little tired of Thomas Middleditch.
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:33.520]   Thomas Middleditch. See, I don't know anybody's name. You know, your husband's lucky. Do you do
[00:18:33.520 --> 00:18:38.480]   that for your husband? Yeah. Who's that? Who is she? I saw and you go, "Oh yeah, that's Thomas
[00:18:38.480 --> 00:18:42.400]   Middleditch." I'm literally just like the memory bank of this entire household.
[00:18:42.400 --> 00:18:46.320]   Yeah. Just remember everything. I knew that about you. For some reason, actually, I knew that you
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:51.360]   knew all those names. We'll call you next time we can't thank you to somebody. You got a good,
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:55.040]   you got like a good pair of culture vultures over here for your gathering. Yeah, I know.
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:19:02.240]   Iggy Azalea will be in the Monster ad promoting their new wireless headphones.
[00:19:03.360 --> 00:19:08.640]   I think her 15 minutes were over a couple of years ago, weren't they? Maybe not.
[00:19:08.640 --> 00:19:10.320]   I think I got thick, so. I think we can.
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:14.000]   No, she's still, she's still rocking up the YouTube hits with those kids who eat the Tide Pods.
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.480]   Is Tide going to talk about Tide Pods consumption in their ad?
[00:19:16.480 --> 00:19:20.400]   Yeah. I'm going to talk about Tide Pods. That's a real question for me.
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:25.200]   They do have an ad. Wow. Are they just discontinue those?
[00:19:25.200 --> 00:19:28.400]   No way. They're just too delicious.
[00:19:30.080 --> 00:19:33.600]   Stop it. Don't say that. Do not eat Tide Pods.
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:35.120]   The new flavor is Tide Pods.
[00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:37.920]   They're not delicious. They could kill you.
[00:19:37.920 --> 00:19:41.520]   Yeah, that's going to be the combination Doritos Mountain Dew Tide Pods.
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:43.600]   Chain all three together.
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:46.720]   What do you do if you're tied? Do you acknowledge the Tide Pod issue?
[00:19:46.720 --> 00:19:50.960]   You have to. I can all, I mean, they've had to say like, please don't eat them. But the thing is,
[00:19:50.960 --> 00:19:53.920]   that's sort of like the Streisand effect just a little bit.
[00:19:53.920 --> 00:19:56.800]   I think we just like Darlene take a tour.
[00:19:56.800 --> 00:20:00.320]   Disconnecting to you then. Let's let this naturally take out a little bit of the pod.
[00:20:00.320 --> 00:20:01.760]   Nature has provided a solution for you.
[00:20:01.760 --> 00:20:07.280]   If you do an ad that reaches 100 million people that says, please do not eat Tide Pods.
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:08.880]   People are going to try them.
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:09.600]   People are going to eat them. Yeah.
[00:20:09.600 --> 00:20:11.440]   10,000 people are going to eat them.
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:12.960]   Yeah. You can't.
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:15.280]   Because they're going to say, well, why shouldn't I?
[00:20:15.280 --> 00:20:17.680]   Or I'm not letting you tell me what you're eating them.
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:19.440]   I must be able to eat them. I haven't tried that.
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:25.120]   Yeah. No. They probably don't want me to eat them for probably they're trying to hide how great they are.
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:30.480]   That's probably it. I'm old enough to remember when watching your child's mouth out with soap was good parenting.
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:33.280]   These are Grouppon.
[00:20:33.280 --> 00:20:35.120]   This Tide Pods. Is Grouppon still a thing?
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:38.400]   They are advertising like crazy as of late.
[00:20:38.400 --> 00:20:41.600]   Tiffany Haddish. Yeah. Let me tell you, Tiffany Haddish, that appearance,
[00:20:41.600 --> 00:20:50.400]   I mean, that she's like a Grouppon spokesperson now and like, it's yeah, she's amazing and hilarious.
[00:20:50.400 --> 00:20:51.440]   You should get her on this show.
[00:20:51.440 --> 00:20:52.800]   So please be my memory bank.
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:54.800]   Tiffany Haddish, who's she?
[00:20:54.800 --> 00:20:57.040]   She's a stand-up comedian.
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:20:57.360]   Okay.
[00:20:57.360 --> 00:20:59.360]   And she was in Girls Trip last year.
[00:20:59.360 --> 00:21:00.560]   I never knew who that was.
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:00.800]   Oh my god.
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:03.760]   Had a really good SNL hosting gig just a little while ago as well.
[00:21:03.760 --> 00:21:04.800]   Hilarious. Great job.
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.240]   She's doing very well right now.
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:06.240]   Yeah.
[00:21:06.240 --> 00:21:07.040]   These guys, they know.
[00:21:07.040 --> 00:21:08.000]   All right.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:10.960]   She's a best-selling author. She's a really great book.
[00:21:10.960 --> 00:21:14.480]   She told a story about taking Will and Jada Pinkett Smith
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:21.200]   on a swamp tour in Louisiana that she bought on Grouppon.
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:22.000]   That was on cue.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:22.160]   Yeah.
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:22.960]   That went viral.
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:23.680]   Yeah.
[00:21:23.680 --> 00:21:24.960]   Very funny.
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:26.960]   She apparently will be in the Super Bowl spot.
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.640]   Oh, she should be.
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:30.400]   She's the best thing.
[00:21:30.400 --> 00:21:34.720]   She to-- so Leo, if you haven't heard the story of her taking Will and Jada on this
[00:21:34.720 --> 00:21:42.800]   swamp tour, she tells Jada Pinkett Smith, like, I have a swamp tour group on, like a boat tour.
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:43.600]   Yeah.
[00:21:43.600 --> 00:21:46.080]   And Jada's like, oh yeah, okay, we'll go with you.
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:52.800]   And so I guess, like, she picks up Will and Jada Smith in her car, like her Corolla.
[00:21:52.800 --> 00:21:53.760]   Whatever.
[00:21:53.760 --> 00:21:55.680]   And she's driving them over there.
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:57.040]   And she's like, and we get there.
[00:21:57.040 --> 00:21:58.400]   And it's a group on.
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.720]   So there's tons of other people there for the swamp tour.
[00:22:00.720 --> 00:22:05.680]   And Jada's like, I don't-- why are there so many people here?
[00:22:05.680 --> 00:22:07.440]   And she's like, it's a group on Jada.
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:10.960]   And she goes, I thought, like, I don't-- she doesn't know what a group on was.
[00:22:10.960 --> 00:22:12.640]   Jada Pinkett Smith didn't know what a group on was.
[00:22:12.640 --> 00:22:16.400]   She goes, I thought you said, like, you would have a group to go on this boat, like,
[00:22:16.400 --> 00:22:18.000]   drive it, boat.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.200]   And they were just in public with these--
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:25.920]   they hadn't done stuff in public with a group of people in public in a really long time.
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:27.200]   And so they went on this swamp tour.
[00:22:27.200 --> 00:22:29.600]   It's a really funny story, highly recommended.
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:33.360]   I was watching a group on needs to advertise to get this name recognition
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:35.200]   to high level celebrities.
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:36.240]   And I cover tech, right?
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.600]   She tells it so beautifully.
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:38.960]   I thought they were out of business.
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:41.120]   I thought the group on model was a flop.
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:42.000]   That's--
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:46.160]   They've been on our death wish for death list for a while.
[00:22:46.160 --> 00:22:47.440]   Death watch list, yeah.
[00:22:47.440 --> 00:22:49.520]   Because we've been predicting their end for a while.
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:52.480]   Companies have said they're the worst customers.
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:54.640]   The customers we get from Groupon, they don't come back to the sheep.
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:55.680]   They're the worst.
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:57.360]   We don't want these people.
[00:22:57.360 --> 00:22:59.680]   And we lose money on these Groupon deals.
[00:22:59.680 --> 00:23:02.560]   I'm surprised they're still in business,
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:05.440]   let alone buying ads on the Super Bowl for millions.
[00:23:05.440 --> 00:23:07.440]   The swamp tour operators are happy with Groupon.
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:11.440]   I'm telling you, I think that I really believe that that Tiffany Haddish appearance,
[00:23:11.440 --> 00:23:13.040]   like revitalized Groupon.
[00:23:13.040 --> 00:23:13.680]   Maybe that's it.
[00:23:13.680 --> 00:23:14.720]   They're jumping over on the--
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:15.200]   That's crazy.
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:16.640]   Tiffany Haddish bandwagon.
[00:23:17.360 --> 00:23:21.200]   So the best story of this all though is Tivo.
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:25.200]   Tivo announced, they have a feature which I actually really love.
[00:23:25.200 --> 00:23:27.680]   When you Tivo, when you DVR something on your Tivo,
[00:23:27.680 --> 00:23:30.320]   not all shows, but some shows, Jeopardy is one of them.
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:32.480]   You can press the D button when a commercial comes on,
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:33.600]   it skips to the end of the commercial.
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:35.760]   I'm sure-- I don't know how they get away with this.
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:38.160]   This is what put replay TV out of business, right?
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:39.520]   The networks sued them.
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:40.960]   Yeah, it's interesting.
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:42.320]   Somehow Tivo gets to do this.
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:44.080]   So you press the D button and it'll say,
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:46.320]   you can skip commercials, but it's not on every show.
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:48.240]   So I feel like almost like they're getting permission.
[00:23:48.240 --> 00:23:49.200]   Yeah.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:50.240]   Or something for it.
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:50.720]   Yeah.
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:51.600]   Maybe they're paying for it.
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:52.480]   Yeah, maybe they're paying for it.
[00:23:52.480 --> 00:23:52.720]   Yeah.
[00:23:52.720 --> 00:23:56.480]   So they announced, we're going to do the opposite on the Super Bowl.
[00:23:56.480 --> 00:23:57.840]   We're going to let you skip the game.
[00:23:57.840 --> 00:23:58.880]   Ha.
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:23:59.520]   Brilliant.
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:01.120]   And go right to the commercial.
[00:24:01.120 --> 00:24:02.080]   Brilliant.
[00:24:02.080 --> 00:24:02.640]   I love it.
[00:24:02.640 --> 00:24:05.520]   I think that's going to get some new use of it.
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:07.360]   I'm Tivo-ing it.
[00:24:07.360 --> 00:24:10.480]   Although they've spoiled it really,
[00:24:10.480 --> 00:24:11.520]   because you could see almost all--
[00:24:11.520 --> 00:24:14.880]   There are only a few companies that just don't say anything about their ads ahead of time.
[00:24:15.760 --> 00:24:17.440]   I know what the NFL thinks about that one.
[00:24:17.440 --> 00:24:19.520]   Does one of them--
[00:24:19.520 --> 00:24:20.480]   I think NFL care.
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:23.280]   As long as people are watching the ads,
[00:24:23.280 --> 00:24:24.080]   that's only NFL care.
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:24.080]   Right.
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:24.640]   That's a good point.
[00:24:24.640 --> 00:24:24.960]   Yeah.
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:25.840]   And they get their--
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:27.840]   2 million plus per ad.
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:29.760]   It enables them to get a new audience,
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:32.480]   people who hate sports, who normally avoid the Super Bowl.
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:33.200]   I'll tell you though,
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:35.040]   the thing that bumps me out about the Super Bowl,
[00:24:35.040 --> 00:24:36.560]   still no 4K.
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:38.880]   We're in 2018.
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:40.960]   When will any professional sports league
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:42.000]   step it up and say,
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.240]   "Hey, internet connected world,
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.000]   here's a higher resolution,
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:47.600]   brand new spanking cameras,
[00:24:47.600 --> 00:24:49.280]   get you close to the game."
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:54.800]   The NFL has had a real problem with viewership numbers for the past year plus,
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:57.040]   with every different controversy in the mix.
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:59.520]   Why have they not turned to technology,
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:02.080]   so that when you see those best buy commercials for,
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:04.160]   get the TV for the big game,
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:07.360]   and then the big game is barely in 1080p resolution.
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:08.640]   Sometimes it's only 1080i,
[00:25:08.640 --> 00:25:11.120]   depending on your provider and all that.
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:11.840]   Like,
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:13.040]   I don't understand.
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:15.600]   I've looked everywhere for someone to talk about this,
[00:25:15.600 --> 00:25:17.120]   and maybe I'm the only person who cares
[00:25:17.120 --> 00:25:19.760]   since I have a perfectly nice high pixel TV.
[00:25:19.760 --> 00:25:21.920]   But how do they not make this happen?
[00:25:21.920 --> 00:25:25.040]   Why is this not the story for at least us Super Geeks?
[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:26.880]   - I can think of them with a couple of reasons.
[00:25:26.880 --> 00:25:28.320]   First of all, they don't shoot it in 4K.
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:28.800]   They shoot it in 4K.
[00:25:28.800 --> 00:25:31.200]   - They have upgraded the fleet of cameras.
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:31.760]   - They do.
[00:25:31.760 --> 00:25:32.320]   - They've talked about this.
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:33.360]   - So they can't--
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:35.200]   - They are shooting it in 4K.
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:37.600]   - They have 8K cameras down from--
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:38.160]   - No, no, no, no.
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:40.800]   But those 8K cameras, they don't use as 8K cameras.
[00:25:40.800 --> 00:25:43.760]   They use them so that they can selectively zoom in.
[00:25:43.760 --> 00:25:44.320]   - They can zoom in, yeah.
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:44.720]   - Right, right.
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:45.840]   But they have that stuff.
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:47.520]   So 8K can zoom in, but that's still--
[00:25:47.520 --> 00:25:50.000]   you've got 4K sort of as a possibility.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.920]   - Well, remember that the NVC cannot broadcast in 4K.
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:57.680]   No, there is a standard ATSC3 or whatever it is.
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:59.920]   But nobody's doing it.
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:02.720]   They just frankly bought a lot of new transmitters
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:05.280]   and stuff for HD, not so many years ago.
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:06.640]   - What you're saying is they're not motivated
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.160]   to make the internet better than--
[00:26:09.040 --> 00:26:12.240]   cable companies can do 4K, but they don't like to do 4K
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:15.440]   because again, that uses up bandwidth.
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:18.720]   Comcast is gonna show some of the winter Olympics in 4K
[00:26:18.720 --> 00:26:20.240]   streaming.
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:21.360]   I don't think it's gonna show it as--
[00:26:21.360 --> 00:26:22.320]   - But not live.
[00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:22.880]   - Not live.
[00:26:22.880 --> 00:26:26.000]   - Yeah, none of the whole broadcasting over the air spec
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:28.160]   has to be upgraded, but I still just feel like
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:32.160]   that's the one confluence of all these media companies
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:35.360]   joining forces with all these internet service providers
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:38.400]   that I would like to see as them all at least combined forces
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:41.040]   and give you some internet sports forkiness.
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:41.760]   - Isn't this--
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:42.640]   - So I'm just throwing that out there.
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:44.240]   - This is though what we see all the time,
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:47.040]   which is you have an incumbent, you have the NFL,
[00:26:47.040 --> 00:26:48.160]   you have incumbent networks.
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:49.600]   There's a lot of money here.
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:55.280]   They really are careful of the franchise.
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:26:58.080]   Remember Verizon had an exclusive for a couple of years,
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:26:59.520]   where if you had a Verizon phone,
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:02.160]   you could watch the Super Bowl on your Verizon phone.
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:03.520]   This year there is more streaming.
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:05.360]   I can watch it on YouTube TV.
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:05.760]   - Right.
[00:27:06.480 --> 00:27:11.280]   - I imagine Hulu and Sling and PlayStation View,
[00:27:11.280 --> 00:27:13.360]   I imagine that if you have locals,
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:15.760]   you'd be able to watch the Super Bowl on those.
[00:27:15.760 --> 00:27:16.800]   So there are more streaming--
[00:27:16.800 --> 00:27:17.760]   - Yeah, that's what we're watching it on.
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:19.040]   - Yeah, but there's no competition.
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:20.400]   There's an automatic monopoly.
[00:27:20.400 --> 00:27:23.600]   Somebody's got a monopoly on the, on, well, clearly, NFL.
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:23.920]   - Right.
[00:27:23.920 --> 00:27:25.120]   - And they're incumbents.
[00:27:25.120 --> 00:27:26.800]   They don't, they're reluctant, I think,
[00:27:26.800 --> 00:27:29.680]   to undermine their power here.
[00:27:29.680 --> 00:27:30.720]   - Yeah.
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:32.000]   - Well, it's just, it's a lot of effort.
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:34.160]   And if they don't need to, then why would they?
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:35.360]   There's no incentive.
[00:27:35.360 --> 00:27:37.280]   There's this one guy named Sam who's bitching.
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:39.200]   Everybody else says HD, that's great.
[00:27:39.200 --> 00:27:41.680]   - There, I'll be curious to see what the viewership numbers are
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:43.440]   just because the NFL's been on a downward trend.
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:45.920]   The Super Bowl may be that total anomaly blip
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:47.280]   where people tune in no matter what.
[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:48.240]   So I'll be curious to see.
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:48.320]   - Right.
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:50.400]   - We know who we will not see on a Super Bowl ad.
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:52.160]   I can pretty much promise this Colin Kaepernick.
[00:27:52.160 --> 00:27:54.960]   Not gonna be on a Super Bowl ad.
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:55.520]   - Probably right.
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:27:59.280]   - Oh, by the way, got the price very much wrong.
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:03.360]   Five million dollars for a 30 second ad.
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:05.760]   - Ooh, keep bubble.
[00:28:05.760 --> 00:28:06.480]   Ben and 10 mil.
[00:28:06.480 --> 00:28:10.000]   - Five million dollars.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   In 2002, it was 1.9 million.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:13.360]   I'm way behind the times.
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:16.320]   - You're back in pets.com land.
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:16.720]   - Yeah.
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:18.480]   - Wow.
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:20.320]   - Yeah, I could have thought, I think the last time I read it,
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:21.520]   it was the right three.
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:24.800]   So it's gone up since I leave and even the last time I read about it.
[00:28:24.800 --> 00:28:27.200]   - Well, it goes up, of course, as you get closer to the game.
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:29.440]   And there were some, this is as of January 14th,
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:30.640]   when there's still some slots open.
[00:28:30.640 --> 00:28:33.120]   They were, they said, but you're gonna pay $5 million.
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:35.520]   That's 50 Cent will just pay for his spot with Bitcoin anyway.
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:36.000]   So it's fine.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:36.880]   - Well, here's the irony.
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:40.720]   That's actually, that's 5 million more than the Eagles paid their quarterback,
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:42.080]   Nick Foles, for 2017.
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:44.960]   His contract's just under 5 million.
[00:28:44.960 --> 00:28:45.440]   - 30 seconds.
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:47.600]   - 30 seconds of TV time and you get made.
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:51.120]   - And that's not even, that's not even counting the production.
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:51.520]   - Right.
[00:28:51.520 --> 00:28:55.440]   So if it's, how much is Kannu Reeves to make an ad?
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:56.480]   He's a million bucks, right?
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:58.640]   Kannu doesn't get out of bed for less than a million bucks.
[00:28:58.640 --> 00:29:02.720]   So you got 5 million, a million, and then another million in production.
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:03.440]   - Right.
[00:29:03.440 --> 00:29:03.920]   For one.
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:04.320]   - Oh, it's guy.
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:06.080]   The thing is, it depends on the ad.
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:10.400]   I mean, the Doritos Mountain Dew one with Peter Dinklage and Morgan Freeman,
[00:29:10.400 --> 00:29:13.280]   that's way more than a million dollars to shoot that.
[00:29:13.280 --> 00:29:15.040]   - Mary Jane Blige is on that too, right?
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:18.240]   - It's like, no, I think it's Missy Elliot.
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:19.600]   - I'm sorry, Missy Elliot, yes.
[00:29:19.600 --> 00:29:25.200]   But it's, I mean, it's literally like four very famous people.
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:28.080]   It has special effects.
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:29.040]   There's pyrotechics.
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:30.080]   They're on different sets.
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:36.240]   Like it's the production value of it, not to mention the cost of having an ad agency
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:38.880]   create these things that you're paying them to do.
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:42.720]   I mean, at minimum, I would imagine a 30 second spot.
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:46.080]   If you're paying $5 million for it, you're going to want to go all in.
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:46.320]   - Sure.
[00:29:46.320 --> 00:29:50.160]   - So like Amazon with Cardi B and they have real Wilson and like all these other people,
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:53.760]   you're probably spending over 10 to $20 million on this.
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:56.640]   - Having the good old days of sock puppets, man.
[00:29:56.640 --> 00:29:59.760]   You know, just when real, when companies could just have reasonable,
[00:29:59.760 --> 00:30:01.520]   super bowl commercials on this those days.
[00:30:01.520 --> 00:30:02.960]   - Sockpuck was for shit.
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:03.920]   Way cheaper than here.
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:06.400]   - I'm feeling like I'm running and I'm feeling like I gotta get away, get away, get away,
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:08.000]   better know that I know and I won't ever stop.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:09.440]   - But you know, I gotta win every day, day.
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:09.920]   - Go!
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:12.960]   - See, baby, baby, when I pop it, just know that you will never pop me.
[00:30:12.960 --> 00:30:14.400]   - And I know that I gotta be a little cocky.
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:16.960]   - Oh, that's buster wine.
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:19.760]   Yes, as Peter Dinklish is lip syncing,
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.120]   - Give me a little thing and then I can give me two more.
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:23.360]   - Buster arrives using a portrait frame.
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:25.200]   And then everything's on fire.
[00:30:25.200 --> 00:30:27.280]   - And it's a place, a bold new flavor that brings the heat.
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:28.800]   - And it goes to the bullfight.
[00:30:28.800 --> 00:30:29.280]   - And it goes to the bullfight.
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:30.080]   - And then it goes to the bullfight.
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:31.040]   - And it goes to the bullfight.
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:33.600]   - This is Morgan Freeman.
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:34.720]   - Morgan Freeman is so much.
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:36.720]   - This is Missy Elliott.
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:38.720]   - This is Missy Elliott.
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:41.200]   - This is the second adder of the same adder.
[00:30:41.200 --> 00:30:41.760]   - Say that!
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:43.360]   - It's like a tampa.
[00:30:43.360 --> 00:30:44.720]   - It's like a tampa.
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:45.280]   - Corporate six.
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:48.000]   - It's all PepsiCo, right?
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:48.880]   - Yeah.
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:53.120]   - But you don't do the add for the 30 seconds.
[00:30:53.120 --> 00:30:54.560]   You do it for what we just did.
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:56.720]   And you get it for all the buzz, the talk.
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:57.360]   - The replay value.
[00:30:57.360 --> 00:30:58.560]   - The replay value.
[00:30:58.560 --> 00:30:59.680]   - The water cooler talk.
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:02.720]   Well, that's why I'm so curious as to why they stopped
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:06.240]   being secretive about it and an airing of the day up.
[00:31:06.240 --> 00:31:08.800]   Because that's a thing you would talk about the next day
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:09.600]   at the office.
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:12.480]   - Oh, but this way you're talking about it for all week long.
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:15.360]   - I guess, but do you feel like if it comes out on Wednesday
[00:31:15.360 --> 00:31:17.280]   before the Super Bowl, it's kind of old news,
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:20.320]   considering how fast the news cycle is on the internet at this point?
[00:31:20.320 --> 00:31:21.520]   - Like we've all seen it.
[00:31:21.520 --> 00:31:23.040]   - You would have a Wednesday, like we've seen it.
[00:31:23.040 --> 00:31:23.520]   It's over.
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:24.320]   - Yeah.
[00:31:24.320 --> 00:31:27.520]   - I think ultimately there's a sense of global impact,
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:28.960]   especially when you're talking about Doritos,
[00:31:28.960 --> 00:31:30.800]   Mountain Dew, these global brands.
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:33.280]   So getting something out there and having that talked about
[00:31:33.280 --> 00:31:35.600]   all over the world spread across YouTube and every domain
[00:31:35.600 --> 00:31:38.640]   and every Chinese video provider, etc, etc, etc.
[00:31:38.640 --> 00:31:41.600]   My guess is there's a bazillion pounds of data
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:44.560]   that tells these companies exactly what and how to drop the facts.
[00:31:44.560 --> 00:31:47.680]   - I think you have to point to YouTube as a big factor in this
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:50.720]   because I don't know, we should look at the YouTube fewer numbers,
[00:31:50.720 --> 00:31:53.440]   but probably 100 million, 200 million, 300 million,
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:56.160]   probably over the week that it's on you.
[00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:57.600]   Big and even though--
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:31:58.480]   - Millions of views.
[00:31:58.480 --> 00:31:59.280]   - Millions anyway.
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:02.160]   We know that those numbers, I don't know,
[00:32:02.160 --> 00:32:04.160]   YouTube numbers seem slightly inflated.
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:08.400]   Maybe it's one 14 year old in Bloomington,
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:10.720]   watching it 100,000 times, I don't know.
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:14.800]   But to an ad agency or to a big brand,
[00:32:14.800 --> 00:32:17.600]   they think of those as comparable to the number of people
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:19.200]   watching the Super Bowl.
[00:32:19.200 --> 00:32:20.960]   So they're really-- - The plus the numbers,
[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:23.600]   the numbers you get off of YouTube are definitely more reliable
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:25.040]   than Nielsen estimates.
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:26.080]   - Are they?
[00:32:26.080 --> 00:32:29.440]   - I mean, even if you talk about click inflation and these things on the internet,
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:34.560]   that's still better than Nielsen's just been running in this decades old predictor forever.
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:38.240]   I've always wondered at what point that glass house is going to shatter and fall.
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:44.160]   - They're trying really hard to convert to digital and VOD and all this stuff,
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:46.400]   but it's just, oh, they waited so long.
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:48.320]   - For a long time, they didn't mention--
[00:32:48.320 --> 00:32:50.000]   - On demand. - No, not at all.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.160]   - They didn't measure DVR or anything.
[00:32:52.160 --> 00:32:58.240]   - Yeah, that Doritos commercial, by the way, Doritos versus Mountain Dew has 2.3 million views.
[00:32:58.240 --> 00:33:04.000]   - Okay, that's not huge, but it's not quite too knock to knock, but it's getting there.
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:06.400]   - Alexa, you're losing-- oh, sorry.
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:11.760]   Her losing her voice, that 90 second ad, 21 million views.
[00:33:11.760 --> 00:33:12.720]   - Whoa, okay.
[00:33:12.720 --> 00:33:14.800]   See, that's numbers.
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:16.800]   - That's the 31st, went up about a week ago.
[00:33:16.800 --> 00:33:21.440]   - And I think you make an interesting point that Amazon, even though they know
[00:33:21.440 --> 00:33:27.360]   YouTube numbers, whatever, that's somebody pressed play and watched it, so that's a real
[00:33:27.360 --> 00:33:28.240]   number to them.
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:29.760]   That actually is the big challenge.
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:32.160]   We're gonna talk about a little bit when we talk about Facebook's results.
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:38.000]   Google and Facebook, that's the real challenge faced by TV at this point,
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:44.960]   and why the NFL probably is secretly shaking in their boots is that these ad aid companies,
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:49.600]   like Google and Facebook, know so much more and give you so much better metrics than any
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:56.240]   television ad and can target so much better, in effect, be so much more efficient than any TV ad.
[00:33:56.240 --> 00:34:03.920]   Maybe this is the last stand for the TV ad where it's a big deal and people are talking about it
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:10.320]   and you get all these views and other platforms, but I have to think an ad on episode 5 of Everybody
[00:34:10.320 --> 00:34:15.040]   Loves Raymond is not nearly as efficient as buying more Facebook.
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:15.440]   - No way.
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:15.840]   - No way.
[00:34:15.840 --> 00:34:16.000]   - Yeah, no.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:23.280]   - It's the live event stuff is the major exception that every TV network is crazy about.
[00:34:23.280 --> 00:34:29.120]   And so even with that involved, it still ends up being, well, people are going to talk about it
[00:34:29.120 --> 00:34:32.880]   and gather together, but we got to put it everywhere. We got to take advantage of every
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:38.320]   possibility. We have to be on every social network. We have to legitimize the fact that we're paying
[00:34:38.320 --> 00:34:43.440]   somebody's salary to have a social media role on our team, blah, blah, blah. It's,
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:48.640]   you know, everybody's throwing crap in every direction and trying to make video impressions,
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:52.560]   work, stick in the best way possible. And I think, yeah, in the next five years,
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:56.800]   we're going to see all the stuff shift in such a major way as more people just go,
[00:34:56.800 --> 00:35:01.040]   oh, I do have other ways to watch TV because there's still are people who are
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:04.480]   not cutting the cord and that is just going to change and change and change.
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:11.040]   - Yeah, it'll just keep those people will keep getting older and older and stop watching TV.
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:14.640]   Like really, I mean, or just, you know, - We watch more TV.
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:18.480]   - The old folks watch more TV. - I think it's like in the way of like,
[00:35:18.480 --> 00:35:23.440]   stop seeking new TV. Like they watch what they're familiar with and then, you know,
[00:35:23.440 --> 00:35:28.080]   like my grandpa, it's like, I think maybe 15 years ago, he might have been interested in watching
[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:34.240]   like a show and now it's like really live sports. It's baseball and, you know, he football
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:37.840]   and that's the stuff he watches and it's like pretty much it.
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:42.400]   - I'm still convinced that CBS's ratings mostly are constituted of old folks who've
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:45.200]   forgotten to turn the channel off and not at all while watching.
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:50.320]   - I saw a tweet today that said CNN and Fox News are doing to our parents what our parents
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:53.520]   thought video games would do to us. - That's a really good point.
[00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:56.640]   That is a really, they're making them violent and anti-social.
[00:35:56.640 --> 00:35:58.160]   - Exactly. - I agree.
[00:35:58.160 --> 00:36:04.000]   - Here's a stat we'll close with. By the time the average American reaches 65,
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:06.320]   he or she will have watched nine years of television.
[00:36:06.320 --> 00:36:09.280]   - That's depressing. - Nine years.
[00:36:09.280 --> 00:36:12.480]   - And they probably still want to get the shot. - I feel like I've already watched nine years of television.
[00:36:12.480 --> 00:36:15.200]   I'm going to be honest with you. - Ashley is kind of like...
[00:36:15.200 --> 00:36:18.880]   - I think I've watched nine years of Breaking Bad. I've just watched it over and over again.
[00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:24.560]   - That's usual at overachiever. - It's still like I've watched like there's like three series
[00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:27.760]   that I've watched multiple times. I feel like that's nine years of my time.
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:32.880]   - I can't think... I want to watch Breaking Bad again. It's arguably one of the best series ever made.
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:35.200]   - But I also... - It's so good at 4K.
[00:36:35.200 --> 00:36:37.920]   - Can you watch it again? Really? I feel like I saw it.
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:43.280]   - Yeah. It's so good. I just read a book about Breaking Bad. So Alan Steppenwald's
[00:36:43.280 --> 00:36:46.960]   this really great TV critic and he wrote this compendium that you can...
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:51.280]   or this companion book called Breaking Bad 101. And so I read it and then I went back and
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:58.720]   watched the episodes along with each of his episode rundowns about the artistic choices in the episode
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:04.400]   and things like that. And I thought it was really cool how without giving away any spoilers,
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:09.760]   if you haven't seen Breaking Bad, anybody out there, how the last four episodes are pretty widely
[00:37:09.760 --> 00:37:14.560]   considered to be like the greatest for like final episodes of television. I mean, just...
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:16.640]   - Completely agree. - It is a masterpiece.
[00:37:16.640 --> 00:37:18.000]   - It's a masterpiece. - It's a masterpiece.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.240]   - And he says in the book, he's like, I think it's really interesting that if you look at each one
[00:37:22.240 --> 00:37:28.240]   of those episodes, they each are sort of their own ending to the show. Like you have sort of a
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:33.120]   lawful ending and then like a chaos ending and a nihilist ending. Like each episode has these
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:40.160]   very specific themes and could very well on their own be considered the end of the show.
[00:37:40.160 --> 00:37:43.040]   - I like the chaotic good ending. - And the good ending. That's my favorite.
[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:44.240]   - Yeah, watching... - Yeah, lawful neutral.
[00:37:44.240 --> 00:37:50.000]   - Being able to watch like being able to watch them after having read this really excellent breakdown
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:54.720]   of the series, like really it was very enriching for me. - It's in 4K.
[00:37:55.920 --> 00:38:00.480]   - That's so beautiful. - I know. What are we going on about 4K for? Who cares about 4K?
[00:38:00.480 --> 00:38:06.000]   - I care. I care. I admit. - I care about my narrative television, but like live TV,
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.440]   like sports, I'm just like, I don't care. Like do we care?
[00:38:09.440 --> 00:38:10.480]   - Yes. - I care.
[00:38:10.480 --> 00:38:14.800]   - Girl, what a happy day each other. - When they finally roll it out,
[00:38:14.800 --> 00:38:19.840]   we'll all be convinced I could go on and on and derail the entire show. We'll just tune into my
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:24.960]   special Sam Betsy NFL podcast. You will be happy 2020. - I feel like frames is more important.
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:29.280]   - You'll be happy in 2020. Yes, I agree with you, Ashley. Actually, it is more important.
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:33.120]   You'll be happy though, 8K for the Summer Olympics in 2020.
[00:38:33.120 --> 00:38:35.440]   - I'm into it. - By then I'm in a 120K.
[00:38:35.440 --> 00:38:38.560]   - You know why? Coming from Japan, and that's the land of tomorrow.
[00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:40.320]   - Yep. - It lives in the future.
[00:38:40.320 --> 00:38:43.120]   - It's the future. - If they literally live in the future, they're doing it right now.
[00:38:43.120 --> 00:38:45.520]   It's way beyond. They've already watched the Super Bowl.
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:51.600]   - High frame rate is interesting. Did you see, I bought the UHD HDR DVD of Billy
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:57.680]   Lynn's long halftime walk, which, angly, intentionally shot at 120 frames.
[00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:00.960]   He didn't have anybody wear makeup. - Is it disturbing?
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:02.000]   - It's disturbing. - Yeah.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.080]   - Because... - It looks very cheap.
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:06.960]   - Yeah, it looks like video. - It looks like VHS.
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:10.960]   - Your first reaction is, yes, it's like a soap opera. It's like cheap.
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:19.120]   And you see actors that you've been seeing for years in all their warts and all.
[00:39:19.120 --> 00:39:22.800]   And it's kind of disconcerting. Like, wow, she's got a lot of freckles.
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:25.040]   - Very great. - And then...
[00:39:25.040 --> 00:39:31.840]   You kind of... I noticed over the period of the movie, I kind of had to forget that.
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:34.720]   And then it's very... And this is what angly was going for, very engaging,
[00:39:34.720 --> 00:39:36.800]   because it's like watching real people. - Yeah.
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:39.280]   - It's like you're looking like this is going on right here.
[00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:42.400]   - Isn't that how Peter Jackson shot the Hobbit?
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:45.440]   - Yeah, but people complained because they said they looked like Gandalf's staff
[00:39:45.440 --> 00:39:47.760]   was bought at Wizard's R.S. and stuff. I mean, it looked...
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:51.120]   - Yeah, that was 48. - Maybe high fantasy is not...
[00:39:51.120 --> 00:39:54.320]   Yeah, that was... Because that was double projector age.
[00:39:54.320 --> 00:39:59.360]   - Maybe high fantasy is not the right genre for that.
[00:39:59.360 --> 00:40:01.040]   - I think they haven't figured out what to do with the technology.
[00:40:01.040 --> 00:40:05.760]   I think once you have something that sort of fast-moving and HD,
[00:40:05.760 --> 00:40:10.480]   you can tweak it digitally to selectively make things a little on the blurry side,
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:13.000]   a little on the sharp side. You can enhance a fake 3D-
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:14.480]   - You can make it more magic. - You can do all kinds of things.
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:17.040]   - You can add, you can't take away if you have ghosting.
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:18.880]   - I think he was doing very consciously.
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:22.800]   He was using very wide lenses, getting very close to the actors.
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:25.760]   They were often looking right at you at the camera.
[00:40:25.760 --> 00:40:28.800]   He was intentionally playing off of this hyper-real.
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:33.520]   That's why no makeup. He didn't want it to look like fantasy.
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:36.800]   He wanted you to be engaged with Billy Lynn's reality.
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:39.920]   And it is disconcerting. It's not what we're used to.
[00:40:39.920 --> 00:40:42.720]   It's not movie-ish. But I think it worked.
[00:40:42.720 --> 00:40:44.400]   I think it was very interesting.
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:51.600]   By the way, I would say if you can, and I'm sure every 4K TV now is high dynamic range.
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:52.640]   Right, Sam? I think so.
[00:40:52.640 --> 00:40:56.720]   - It's pretty much if you're on the market now, HDR is becoming pretty standard for those.
[00:40:56.720 --> 00:40:59.920]   - We were talking about altered carbon before the show,
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:03.840]   which is the new Netflix sci-fi show, "Great Novel," which everybody should read first.
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:08.800]   Because it's a great sci-fi novel. But I thought that it was beautiful and it was HDR.
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:10.240]   And man...
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:14.640]   - Oh, yeah. They've got those Blade Runner-esque cityscapes that just pop with all of that life.
[00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:18.320]   - Yeah. I mean, it's a dark cityscape and there's headlights and the headlights make you squint
[00:41:18.320 --> 00:41:22.080]   like in real life, because they're so bright compared to the dark. It's very well done.
[00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:23.520]   - It's really nice to be on regard.
[00:41:23.520 --> 00:41:30.000]   - And then I'm so sad. I bought my 4K TV right before they all just by default started coming with HDR.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:32.880]   And I was like, "What have I done?" I was like, "I bought this 70-inch cut.
[00:41:32.880 --> 00:41:35.120]   Beautiful 70-inch 4K TV."
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:36.240]   - Throw it in the trash.
[00:41:36.240 --> 00:41:37.040]   - Five months later.
[00:41:37.040 --> 00:41:39.520]   - Yeah, it's like, "It's all about HDR."
[00:41:39.520 --> 00:41:40.080]   - I'm sure.
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:42.320]   - I hate everything in the universe right now.
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:46.400]   HDR is more important, in my opinion, than 4K. You'll get 4K, but it's...
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:50.400]   - Yeah, I agree. I agree. And it's so frustrating. I'm like, "What have I done?"
[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:50.880]   - Yeah.
[00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:54.880]   - With the more pixels and more color information, that is where the sweet spot comes.
[00:41:54.880 --> 00:41:58.880]   I will say about high frame rate, just real quick, video games are going to be one of the things
[00:41:58.880 --> 00:42:02.880]   that leads that because when you control, when you are the director and cinematographer,
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:07.120]   there's that. And there's one other form of video that I think high frame rate will be together.
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:08.160]   - I know, which one you're thinking of.
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:10.880]   - The one that drives every single video technology in the world.
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:14.160]   Let me just say this, it's a little too realistic.
[00:42:14.160 --> 00:42:14.400]   - Yes.
[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:16.080]   - I wouldn't know.
[00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:19.680]   - Yeah, sure. All right, we're going to take a break.
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:25.200]   Enough of this. This has been too much fun talking about media, but we got Sam and Ashley.
[00:42:25.200 --> 00:42:29.920]   We really got to do it, but we're going to move over to the quarterly results.
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:34.240]   They're in, and I think we will have things to say about that. Lots more to talk about.
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:38.560]   A great episode. Mike Elgin is here from Computer World and Fast Company.
[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:43.680]   Elgin.com. Good friend of the show, and it's always great to see him before he heads up back
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:45.200]   on the road. You're going to Italy next.
[00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:48.480]   - We're first going to go to France, then to Italy, then back to France.
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:49.120]   - Oh, shock.
[00:42:49.120 --> 00:42:50.160]   - Somebody's got to do it, Leo.
[00:42:50.160 --> 00:42:52.240]   - That's not going to get it.
[00:42:52.240 --> 00:42:58.880]   - She is with CNET and is going to be on something very exciting tomorrow morning at 10am.
[00:42:58.880 --> 00:43:02.240]   Go to cNET.com and download the new show, whatever it is.
[00:43:02.240 --> 00:43:05.280]   - Yes. If you like electric cars, do my knee.
[00:43:05.280 --> 00:43:07.360]   - Oh, I'm going to be so jealous if you get that beat.
[00:43:08.240 --> 00:43:11.120]   I drive a Tesla. I wanted to do an electric car show.
[00:43:11.120 --> 00:43:16.400]   - I'm waiting for my Model 3. I pre-ordered it almost to, on my birthday, like two years ago.
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:18.720]   - Did you get the build invite? You must have gotten the build invite.
[00:43:18.720 --> 00:43:21.920]   - Not yet. I'm a non-owner, so I'm a non-existing owner,
[00:43:21.920 --> 00:43:28.320]   so I'm waiting for those non-owner invites to go out. I feel good about February, though.
[00:43:28.320 --> 00:43:30.160]   I really genuinely do.
[00:43:30.160 --> 00:43:35.920]   - Pro-tip? Pro-tip? You don't want to get any new Model Tesla for the first year, so that's fine.
[00:43:36.720 --> 00:43:38.080]   - Well, it sounds like I think I will.
[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:42.560]   - Well, let's put this away. The longer you wait, the better.
[00:43:42.560 --> 00:43:45.760]   - The longer you wait, it's better. Yeah, that's what I've heard from just about everybody.
[00:43:45.760 --> 00:43:49.920]   So I'm totally fine waiting. I'm very excited about it.
[00:43:49.920 --> 00:43:55.440]   And I was a day one pre-order in store on March 31st of 2016.
[00:43:55.440 --> 00:44:03.040]   And now my birthday is March 31st, so I'm like, if I can just get my Model 3 in time for my birthday,
[00:44:03.040 --> 00:44:04.800]   I'll feel really good about it.
[00:44:04.800 --> 00:44:09.360]   - I love it. - But I am really excited. I got to write in the review model that Tim
[00:44:09.360 --> 00:44:10.240]   rode. - Oh, nice.
[00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:14.400]   - And by the way, if you guys have not seen our Model 3 review on Roadshow,
[00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:19.040]   it is shot so beautifully. The video is insane. They had drones.
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:19.760]   They took-- - Wow.
[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:23.520]   - It's so nice. The video is absolutely stunning. You should go watch it.
[00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:24.240]   - Is it in 4K?
[00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:26.000]   - Probably.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:28.560]   - You know, I have no idea. Great question. I have no idea.
[00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:32.160]   - We're going to have to up our game. I have to get a drone in the studio is floating there.
[00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:33.280]   - Yeah, you should.
[00:44:33.280 --> 00:44:35.200]   Instead of a jib, you could have a drone.
[00:44:35.200 --> 00:44:38.080]   - Sure. That's what all the cool kids are doing.
[00:44:38.080 --> 00:44:43.120]   For Mars Technica, he's their culture vulture, Sam Meshkovich.
[00:44:43.120 --> 00:44:45.360]   Great to have all three of you here. I showed today,
[00:44:45.360 --> 00:44:48.480]   I'm not going to be able to do this Super Bowl version of this ad.
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:50.080]   You could try.
[00:44:50.080 --> 00:44:54.560]   I don't have Missy Elliott here. I don't have Morgan Freeman here,
[00:44:54.560 --> 00:44:59.440]   but I am a fan of Quicken Loans and Rocket Mortgage. Yes, they're going to be on the Super Bowl this
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:02.800]   year. Quicken Loans, it's Dan Gilbert. He's a brilliant guy.
[00:45:02.800 --> 00:45:08.960]   Fatted Quicken Loans in the 90s as I think rock capital, something like that,
[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:13.760]   sold it to Quicken in 1999, bought it back in 2002, said, "No, I'm taking it back. I want to do
[00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:19.840]   my own thing." He's the guy who's revitalizing downtown to treat brilliant guy. He is a high tech
[00:45:19.840 --> 00:45:23.920]   guy. He took Quicken Loans and he said, "You know what we need? We need to modernize the loan
[00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:27.600]   approval process. We need to put it online because there's a group of people,
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:32.560]   you guys who would do that. Don't want to go to a bank to get a loan. Don't want to go to the
[00:45:32.560 --> 00:45:38.960]   attic to get the paperwork, the pay stubs and the balances and the bank statements for 14 years
[00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:44.240]   ago. You don't want to do that. That's why he created Rocket Mortgage and I love it. Rocket Mortgage
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:51.600]   dot com slash twit two. It's all online. In fact, it's so much online you could do it on your phone.
[00:45:51.600 --> 00:45:56.400]   You could do it at an open house. You could do it like while you're buying a house. You just go to
[00:45:56.400 --> 00:46:00.480]   rocketmortgage.com slash twit two. In fact, you can do that right now, set up the account so you'll
[00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:05.520]   be ready. If you're in the market for a house or you're thinking about a refi, then when it comes
[00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:10.320]   time and you say, "All right, time to get the loan," you give them basic information you know in your
[00:46:10.320 --> 00:46:15.520]   head. They, because they have trusted relationships with all the financial institutions, get everything
[00:46:15.520 --> 00:46:19.760]   else they need with your permission, of course. Then they crunch the numbers and all of this just
[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:24.640]   takes a minute or two. Then they say, "Based on income assets and credits, you qualify for these
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:29.680]   home loans. You choose the rate. You choose the term. You choose the down payment. You press go and
[00:46:29.680 --> 00:46:38.320]   that's it." Two, three minutes later, tops. You are approved. Rocket Mortgage from quick and loans apply
[00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:44.080]   simply. Understand fully mortgage confidently. Watch the Super Bowl ad. I'm sure they'll do this in a
[00:46:44.080 --> 00:46:49.280]   much more sexy fashion. Rocketmortgage.com slash twit and the number two, rocketmortgage.com
[00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:52.720]   slash twit two. But you know it'd be funny as if you watched the Super Bowl ad and then went to
[00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:57.520]   rocketmortgage.com slash twit two. That would make me really happy.
[00:46:57.520 --> 00:47:04.880]   I would have done that ad and been like, "Are you a multi-superbowl winning quarterback who's looking
[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:08.400]   for their 12th home?" Tom Brady. I don't have the time. Tom Brady.
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:15.040]   Blind from mortgage. Rocket Mortgage. Right. Get gizelle to do it. It's easy. He's still married to her,
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:20.560]   right? Yes. Okay. Just checking. I don't keep up on this stuff. Equal housing, lender license,
[00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:27.040]   in all 50 states and MLS consumer access.org number 30. 30 rocketmortite. Tell gizelle, Tom.
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:34.720]   Rocketmortgage.com slash twit two. House number 13 is going to be the easiest house you ever bought.
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:39.520]   Or maybe refi all the other ones. Yeah. Yeah. There you go. Yeah. I'm pleased.
[00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:42.480]   So many options. If you see the rocket mortgage ad in the Super Bowl,
[00:47:42.480 --> 00:47:48.160]   right when the ad plays, go to rocketmortgage.com slash twit two. Just do that for me, will you?
[00:47:50.160 --> 00:47:55.360]   Make me very, very, very happy. I went to an unnamed service provider recently, and I thought,
[00:47:55.360 --> 00:48:01.920]   "Is this company still a twit advertiser?" And I put in twit as the avocado.
[00:48:01.920 --> 00:48:04.080]   Just the code. Man, I got a huge discount on what you're making.
[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:06.400]   And you're helping us a lot. It really helps us a lot.
[00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:14.000]   We can't compete with all the kids out there and the Googles and their Facebooks and all that
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:21.440]   stuff. We're kind of old fashioned that way. By the way, let's talk about the corner. I think in
[00:48:21.440 --> 00:48:27.120]   general, a couple of things I could summarize. Apples results came out. Facebook's results
[00:48:27.120 --> 00:48:35.600]   came out. Alphabet slash Google's results came out. Amazon, eBay, all the companies come out with
[00:48:35.600 --> 00:48:40.640]   their quarter. The results for the quarter ending December. And I think one thing you could say,
[00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:44.720]   they all made a lot of money. There was a great quarter for everybody.
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:49.600]   They all paid a lot more in taxes because of the new tax bill. But correct me if I'm wrong,
[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:57.040]   but I think that when they say, "Well, we had to pay, I think Google paid $9.9 billion more in taxes."
[00:48:57.040 --> 00:49:00.720]   It's because they're repatriating hundreds of billions of dollars.
[00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:04.960]   There's a temporary, but a long-term gain in the tax change.
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:11.920]   So you will see that. And there's some companies like Etsy, eBay, it was eBay, Lenovo lost money
[00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:19.440]   in the quarter because of these one-time tax costs. Apple had a big hit, but they still made money.
[00:49:19.440 --> 00:49:23.440]   They're doing okay. They're going to be all right.
[00:49:23.440 --> 00:49:28.640]   I heard a really interesting fact about Apple from that one about the Apple Watch.
[00:49:28.640 --> 00:49:34.720]   I think it's 90% of smart watches sold are Apple watches. And they are now the
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:42.080]   number one watchmaker of any kind in the world. They be Rolex, they be in the last quarter.
[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:48.080]   In the last quarter, they sold more watches that one company than all the Swiss watch companies
[00:49:48.080 --> 00:49:54.720]   combined. Combined. Well, it's interesting though because being the number one watchmaker is like
[00:49:54.720 --> 00:49:59.920]   being the number one Broadway play. Compared to movies, not making that much.
[00:49:59.920 --> 00:50:05.440]   So it's like the Hamilton of... But Tim did say, Tim Cook, the CEO did say that it was
[00:50:05.440 --> 00:50:10.480]   the best-selling quarter for... And it's this series three Apple Watch. And even I, who I really
[00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:15.680]   did not like and I thought the Apple Watch was technically a flop for the first few generations,
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:20.480]   have taken a word every day because I found... And I think this is true of everybody. You find
[00:50:20.480 --> 00:50:25.200]   one or two things that for you particularly sell it and then you wear it. It's an interesting
[00:50:25.200 --> 00:50:28.800]   product. You're wearing yours. You've got to go and wear mine. I have the old one. But they've
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:32.400]   been just chipping away at it. And it's kind of like a gradual. It's a gradual.
[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:37.680]   It's into something really great. It took a while and it's sort of low-key but it happened and
[00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:42.240]   they never gave up on it. And it's pretty interesting. It's a pretty interesting story.
[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:47.840]   Watch, I guess, is other. In this... Jason Stella's these great pie charts,
[00:50:47.840 --> 00:50:51.440]   charts of all kinds every year. Love them. Yeah, it's considered other.
[00:50:52.480 --> 00:50:57.920]   The Beats/Headphone Pro stuff. Yeah, that's in there too. Yeah.
[00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:04.640]   Apple TV is other. 70% of the revenue for Apple calls a Q1 is the last quarter of the year.
[00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:10.560]   They're Christmas buying quarter. 70% revenue is from iPhone. And it's down year over year and
[00:51:10.560 --> 00:51:16.480]   nobody panicked. It was down a little bit. One percent. Well, and we'll talk about that because
[00:51:16.480 --> 00:51:21.280]   there were all these rumors that the iPhone 10 is underperforming. And maybe it is. Not
[00:51:21.280 --> 00:51:26.960]   substantially. Maybe it is. I don't know. 70% iPhone. It's a big driver for Apple. 7% iPad.
[00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:32.720]   That was up, by the way. And Max sales, 8% of total revenue. And I think Max sales were down
[00:51:32.720 --> 00:51:40.080]   slightly from year over year as well as quarter to quarter. That's a little disappointing because I
[00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:46.880]   want... I purely selfishly want Apple not to abandon the Macintosh. But it becomes a shrinking
[00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:52.880]   portion of their revenue and profits. It's going to look at more and more. Big growth in services.
[00:51:52.880 --> 00:52:00.480]   10%. Apple Music. It's music. It's mostly probably the App Store and iCloud. iCloud.
[00:52:00.480 --> 00:52:06.320]   Storage where they yell at you right when you hit your nagging. More money. You need to send us
[00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:13.440]   more money. We're broke. More money. I know. Even though iPhone sales down 1% revenue up 13%.
[00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:19.360]   And that's because it's expensive as well. It happens when you sell 1000 dollar iPhone 10.
[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:23.520]   Yeah. Exactly. I think it's interesting to see a fairly, you know,
[00:52:23.520 --> 00:52:30.960]   hefty jump in iPad sales. Best iPad sales since 2016. iPad Pro. Now that they can actually multitask.
[00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:35.760]   I think the $329 iPad probably helps too. Right? The low cost. They don't break it down. But...
[00:52:35.760 --> 00:52:41.200]   I love that 10.5 iPad Pro. I know it's the first one. That's what you're using.
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:46.400]   I got it with a pencil. I got it with a pencil. I absolutely love it. And I had been like,
[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:49.200]   "I don't really need an iPad anymore after I got the first
[00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:54.080]   plus iPhone." I was just like, "Oh, I don't really know. Like the 6 plus." I was like, "I don't
[00:52:54.080 --> 00:52:59.440]   really need this." And then now I'm like, "Oh man, how do I live without this?" Reading comics on it is
[00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:05.200]   just spectacular. And there's just more people who go into what's my next device going to be
[00:53:05.200 --> 00:53:10.640]   for general browsing, email, etc. etc. And I just think the Surface Pro quite honestly
[00:53:10.640 --> 00:53:17.280]   opened that kind of possibility up of really thin, plus-cell keyboard boom. It's what you need.
[00:53:17.280 --> 00:53:22.320]   It's going to fit into a purse or a bag or what have you. And I just think that has officially...
[00:53:22.320 --> 00:53:26.560]   That doesn't mean the iPad is this incredible Apple saving device. But I do think that is
[00:53:26.560 --> 00:53:30.880]   beginning to be a real piece of the "What's my next machine going to be?" conversation. That was
[00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:37.440]   not the case during iPad's roughest years. Yeah, I did not take a laptop to see, "Yes,
[00:53:37.440 --> 00:53:42.000]   this year. I just want you to..." I've been lately traveling with my iPad 10.5 as well.
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:47.920]   It's still not a Mac. No. No. And I use the Mac. I actually bought the iMac Pro.
[00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:55.120]   You're welcome, Tim. Because I really like the Mac for certain things, for programming,
[00:53:55.120 --> 00:54:00.880]   for video editing, for photo editing. Sure. Same. Right? You have to have a Mac. And if
[00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:05.920]   you're going to develop, this is why I don't imagine Apple will abandon it. If you're going
[00:54:05.920 --> 00:54:11.040]   to write the next great app, at least for now, you're writing on a Mac. There's a lot of talk
[00:54:11.040 --> 00:54:18.080]   about unifying the operating systems or having iPad apps. Or a hybrid. But as Bleak in our chat
[00:54:18.080 --> 00:54:22.880]   from us saying, you see that ad where the kids are going throughout the whole day on our iPad.
[00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:26.080]   And then somebody says, "Put your computer away." She says, "What's a computer?"
[00:54:26.080 --> 00:54:29.680]   Exactly.
[00:54:31.120 --> 00:54:34.480]   You're too young to feel that old. Are you turning the lights out?
[00:54:34.480 --> 00:54:40.640]   That is the show. That's the two-minute warning for the point tops.
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:45.040]   Two-minute warning. Okay, let's go. Okay, we've got to hurry. Let me do four more ads and then
[00:54:45.040 --> 00:54:52.080]   we'll be done. Okay. No, actually, the bottom line is revenue. Apple revenue. Record year for
[00:54:52.080 --> 00:54:57.760]   revenue and profits. A quarter for revenue profits. Again, $88.3 billion in revenue.
[00:54:58.560 --> 00:55:05.280]   And even after a big tax hit, profit, $20 billion in three months. That's, you know,
[00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:09.680]   that's almost $7 billion a month just in the bank.
[00:55:09.680 --> 00:55:16.480]   Luca Maestri, Apple's CFO says, "When we get our money back from Europe, where they've been
[00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:21.120]   holding on to it." They've been hiding it. They've been hiding it from us. No, no, Apple.
[00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:25.600]   Gashing it under a bunch of European mattresses. We know what you were up to. You were up to the
[00:55:25.600 --> 00:55:28.880]   double Irish in the Dutch sandwich. Was it the double Irish in the Dutch sandwich? Something like that.
[00:55:28.880 --> 00:55:33.360]   That's what it is. It always makes me hungry. And those are actual products in the Apple cafeteria.
[00:55:33.360 --> 00:55:38.800]   And for dessert, we'll be serving a double Irish with a Dutch sandwich.
[00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:45.440]   Because they've been keeping almost $260 billion overseas, they're going to pay $38 billion to get it
[00:55:45.440 --> 00:55:51.680]   back. 15% tax rate, but they will get it back. Luca Maestri says, "We're spending it. We're going
[00:55:51.680 --> 00:55:56.720]   to go down to zero. We're getting rid of it. Most of it will go to stock buybacks,
[00:55:56.720 --> 00:56:00.560]   which benefits shareholders and dividends. They did announce a dividend. And that's because
[00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:05.440]   I've learned from Horace Dettie, who had a SIM code that this is really the shareholders.
[00:56:05.440 --> 00:56:09.520]   That's right. It's not Apple's money to spend on another headquarters or something like that.
[00:56:09.520 --> 00:56:13.760]   It belongs to the shareholders. They will spend, they said, $30 billion on another headquarters.
[00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:19.280]   But you can only spend it. The theory is, and there's not, I don't think it's legally binding,
[00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:23.200]   but I think that you're expected by shareholders to only spend it on something that's going to
[00:56:23.200 --> 00:56:29.440]   increase revenue. It's R&D, it's more factories, it's more employees, it's something that's going
[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:36.160]   to build revenue, so we'll get something ultimately. But Luca says, "All the money's going into,
[00:56:36.160 --> 00:56:40.960]   mostly into buybacks and dividends and then someone into a new headquarters,
[00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:48.080]   probably a call center headquarters." I think they should build a massive, shiny headquarters in
[00:56:48.080 --> 00:56:51.920]   San Francisco and then build a custom tunnel between Cupertino and San Francisco.
[00:56:51.920 --> 00:56:53.360]   I know a guy who can bore that tunnel.
[00:56:53.360 --> 00:56:54.240]   I really, yeah.
[00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:58.000]   It should have to be a Elon to get the boring company out there.
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:01.760]   Okay, tell me, Ashley, you bought one of those flamethrowers.
[00:57:01.760 --> 00:57:02.560]   Of course I did.
[00:57:02.560 --> 00:57:03.520]   You did.
[00:57:03.520 --> 00:57:04.560]   Of course I did.
[00:57:04.560 --> 00:57:05.440]   I tweeted about it.
[00:57:05.440 --> 00:57:06.640]   You bought one too, Sam?
[00:57:06.640 --> 00:57:12.320]   No, not myself, Ron Amadeo. We now know it's going to be a not a flamethrower.
[00:57:12.320 --> 00:57:13.600]   It's what this rule is called.
[00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:18.240]   Elon says that they can't ship it overseas because they won't allow delivery flamethrowers,
[00:57:18.240 --> 00:57:20.720]   so they're calling it the boring company not a flamethrower.
[00:57:20.720 --> 00:57:23.840]   Fire extinguisher not included.
[00:57:23.840 --> 00:57:29.040]   It isn't really a flamethrower. It doesn't throw flames. It's a short throw.
[00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:30.000]   It's a very hard throw.
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:30.480]   Not with that attitude.
[00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:32.000]   That's why they're legal in California.
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:33.120]   Yeah, no, with that attitude.
[00:57:33.120 --> 00:57:35.600]   It actually does come with a fire extinguisher.
[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:36.560]   All right, Ashley.
[00:57:36.560 --> 00:57:37.280]   I invite you.
[00:57:37.280 --> 00:57:39.120]   You get a free fire extinguisher.
[00:57:39.120 --> 00:57:40.640]   It does come with a fire extinguisher.
[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:41.200]   It does come with a fire extinguisher.
[00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:41.600]   Yeah, they changed it.
[00:57:41.600 --> 00:57:42.800]   That's going to get that extinct.
[00:57:42.800 --> 00:57:48.960]   At first, he said, you can buy our fire extinguisher at highly overpriced fire extinguisher.
[00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:51.200]   Now they're giving it them to him.
[00:57:51.200 --> 00:57:51.760]   All right, good.
[00:57:51.760 --> 00:57:54.320]   You wouldn't want to stand in front of it.
[00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:56.080]   What are you saying?
[00:57:56.080 --> 00:57:57.760]   It's not a flamethrower.
[00:57:57.760 --> 00:57:59.520]   You can't two to three feet.
[00:57:59.520 --> 00:58:01.120]   It's a very short throw.
[00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:01.760]   A flamethrower.
[00:58:01.760 --> 00:58:03.760]   It would never be in an expendable film.
[00:58:03.760 --> 00:58:04.640]   That's what we're saying.
[00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:05.200]   A flamethrower.
[00:58:05.200 --> 00:58:07.840]   I grew up out in the Southern California desert.
[00:58:07.840 --> 00:58:11.440]   I've seen flamethrowers that are homemade, that should not be
[00:58:11.440 --> 00:58:12.480]   a flamethrower.
[00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:14.240]   I've used flamethrower.
[00:58:14.240 --> 00:58:15.840]   This is no flamethrowers.
[00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:16.400]   That's what you're saying.
[00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:17.760]   The eye-flamethrowers are a good friend of mine.
[00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:18.880]   The eye-flamethrowers, sir.
[00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:20.480]   And you are no flamethrower.
[00:58:20.480 --> 00:58:21.760]   That's basically what that is.
[00:58:21.760 --> 00:58:25.440]   Okay, well, whatever.
[00:58:25.440 --> 00:58:27.040]   Anyway, how do we get into that?
[00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:30.160]   Oh, you're boring a hole between Cupertino and San Francisco.
[00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:31.440]   Anyway.
[00:58:31.440 --> 00:58:32.320]   I have that boring holes.
[00:58:32.320 --> 00:58:34.640]   It was a very, very good year for Apple.
[00:58:34.640 --> 00:58:34.800]   Yes.
[00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:36.240]   And services did very well.
[00:58:36.240 --> 00:58:38.880]   And I think services is the thing to watch going forward.
[00:58:38.880 --> 00:58:40.960]   That's probably explains why Apple's putting a
[00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:42.880]   billion. In fact, now a billion doesn't seem enough.
[00:58:42.880 --> 00:58:45.440]   A billion dollars into original programming.
[00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:46.880]   It isn't enough.
[00:58:46.880 --> 00:58:48.080]   They should just buy all the wood.
[00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:48.720]   It'll be more.
[00:58:48.720 --> 00:58:49.680]   They should just buy all the wood.
[00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:49.680]   It'll be more.
[00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:50.160]   It'll be more.
[00:58:50.160 --> 00:58:51.520]   They could buy all the major studios.
[00:58:51.520 --> 00:58:54.560]   But again, that's not what they would probably want to do.
[00:58:54.560 --> 00:58:58.080]   But they can hire people away as they have.
[00:58:58.080 --> 00:58:58.160]   So much risk.
[00:58:58.160 --> 00:58:58.160]   So much risk.
[00:58:58.160 --> 00:58:58.160]   So much risk.
[00:58:58.160 --> 00:59:00.480]   Apple's going to put a bid in.
[00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:03.680]   Apple's going to put a bid into buy Netflix in four years.
[00:59:03.680 --> 00:59:04.320]   That's my guess.
[00:59:04.320 --> 00:59:04.720]   Really?
[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:09.600]   So I was actually thinking for a while that they would want to buy Disney.
[00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:11.040]   And then I was convinced otherwise.
[00:59:11.040 --> 00:59:12.320]   I don't recall who convinced me.
[00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:15.440]   It's too much of a culture.
[00:59:15.440 --> 00:59:17.040]   It's more employees than Apple has.
[00:59:17.040 --> 00:59:19.840]   So you'd have this real problem of bringing these two companies together.
[00:59:19.840 --> 00:59:20.960]   It would become Disney culturally.
[00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:21.440]   Yeah.
[00:59:21.440 --> 00:59:23.600]   It's very difficult to do that cultural assimilation.
[00:59:23.600 --> 00:59:26.800]   So what did you say?
[00:59:26.800 --> 00:59:28.640]   You started saying something Ashley and we cut you off.
[00:59:28.640 --> 00:59:33.200]   Oh, I think the Apple potentially buying Netflix thing is...
[00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:35.520]   I say maybe.
[00:59:35.520 --> 00:59:36.800]   It's hard to say.
[00:59:36.800 --> 00:59:38.480]   Just because they'd have to really give,
[00:59:38.480 --> 00:59:41.360]   you know, read a really good number.
[00:59:41.360 --> 00:59:44.080]   Even then, like, I don't know.
[00:59:44.080 --> 00:59:46.160]   I feel like they're doing, you know, great.
[00:59:46.160 --> 00:59:48.720]   Like creating their own original content and...
[00:59:48.720 --> 00:59:51.120]   Yeah, what's wrong with Apple just doing...
[00:59:51.120 --> 00:59:55.600]   I just wonder what Apple and Amazon get into a bidding war for Netflix.
[00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:56.800]   If they ever wanted to sell.
[00:59:56.800 --> 00:59:57.600]   Wait, wait, wait.
[00:59:57.600 --> 00:59:59.760]   Why was Netflix succeeding with original content?
[00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:00.800]   Well, they have an option now.
[01:00:00.800 --> 01:00:01.280]   Yeah, that was my question.
[01:00:01.280 --> 01:00:01.840]   It's terrible.
[01:00:01.840 --> 01:00:03.920]   Oh, no, I'm at Netflix.
[01:00:03.920 --> 01:00:04.400]   Netflix.
[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:04.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:04.800 --> 01:00:05.440]   Yeah, absolutely.
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:05.440]   Yeah.
[01:00:05.440 --> 01:00:05.920]   Yeah.
[01:00:05.920 --> 01:00:09.200]   But admittedly, Apple fumbled with what it was called, the app show.
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:09.760]   It was terrible.
[01:00:09.760 --> 01:00:10.960]   Yeah, the app show was terrible.
[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:12.400]   And they took over carpool.
[01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:13.440]   Cariocchi was terrible.
[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:14.240]   Terrible, but...
[01:00:14.240 --> 01:00:17.840]   These are, again, like, these are choices that are being made by somebody who...
[01:00:17.840 --> 01:00:21.840]   Or people who are used to developing technology and not television.
[01:00:21.840 --> 01:00:25.440]   And so, like, I get that they're bringing people on board to do this,
[01:00:25.440 --> 01:00:27.600]   but you got to spend money to make money.
[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:29.520]   The problem with TV and media.
[01:00:29.520 --> 01:00:33.280]   And it doesn't seem like Apple's really willing to make that investment yet.
[01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:36.640]   The problem with carpool cariocchi is that they made it 4K, just ruined it.
[01:00:36.640 --> 01:00:38.800]   I'm going to get a ride.
[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:41.760]   You got your ride, sir.
[01:00:41.760 --> 01:00:42.720]   Yeah, I'm going to quit.
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:45.280]   But Apple...
[01:00:45.280 --> 01:00:53.360]   After the flops hired two executives from Sony, they've been hiring executives...
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:54.880]   Let's hope they're not IT executives.
[01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:55.360]   No, no.
[01:00:55.360 --> 01:00:57.520]   And they've been making deals.
[01:00:57.520 --> 01:00:59.200]   They've got some very good deals.
[01:00:59.200 --> 01:01:01.440]   Drew Barramore has come along.
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:02.480]   They're going to spend...
[01:01:02.480 --> 01:01:04.560]   I think Apple has turned the corner.
[01:01:04.560 --> 01:01:05.920]   I mean, we haven't seen the program yet.
[01:01:05.920 --> 01:01:08.560]   So Apple does these things...
[01:01:08.560 --> 01:01:12.400]   I think when Apple's intending to do something huge in the future, they dabble in it.
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:13.360]   They put their toe in the water.
[01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:14.560]   And the same thing with self-driving cars.
[01:01:14.560 --> 01:01:18.880]   They just move from 3 to 27 self-driving cars.
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:22.560]   I'm sure you'll hear about this on Ashley's show tomorrow.
[01:01:22.560 --> 01:01:28.000]   And in the original program, they want to see what it's like before they buy Netflix or something like that.
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:29.520]   I have the feeling that that's what it's all about.
[01:01:29.520 --> 01:01:33.600]   They're sort of telegraphing intention to dominate some category.
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:35.600]   They're not going to spend a billion dollars on the...
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:39.040]   But Ashley, what would you say if I said that the two executives,
[01:01:39.040 --> 01:01:43.120]   they hired from Sony Pictures Television, oversaw Breaking Bad?
[01:01:43.120 --> 01:01:46.400]   Yeah, see, these are good choices.
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:47.600]   See, now you're getting good people.
[01:01:47.600 --> 01:01:48.720]   It's exactly what Mike's saying.
[01:01:48.720 --> 01:01:50.160]   Like, it's very much...
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:58.160]   Apple has never been at the forefront in the way of like a brand new thing that no one's ever seen before.
[01:01:58.160 --> 01:02:04.320]   Usually they take sort of bits of ideas from things that exist and then polish them to an extent that...
[01:02:04.320 --> 01:02:08.880]   Blizzard does this really well in video games, the same thing.
[01:02:08.880 --> 01:02:14.800]   So they don't necessarily take risks the way that people would like them to.
[01:02:14.800 --> 01:02:19.520]   But what they do is they find these ideas and that's why there's that running gag of like,
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:25.120]   "Oh, Apple claimed to have invented XYZ feature when Androids had it for five years or whatever."
[01:02:25.920 --> 01:02:30.160]   And it's just that they polish it to an extent that it feels new.
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:34.320]   Like, to a lot of people who haven't maybe used that feature before or who have
[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:38.480]   experienced it and found it to be clunky on other devices or other types of hardware.
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:43.440]   That's not to say it's perfect because iOS is...
[01:02:43.440 --> 01:02:46.080]   iOS 11 is kind of a mess.
[01:02:46.080 --> 01:02:52.080]   But yeah, I think at the end of the day, like Apple very much is a company that Mike was saying,
[01:02:52.080 --> 01:02:59.280]   like this is a dip your toe in the water. Let's really understand what it means to be in this business.
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:05.440]   And then once we do that, we can really go all in either by buying a company like Netflix,
[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:08.800]   expanding and opening Apple Studios in Los Angeles.
[01:03:08.800 --> 01:03:11.760]   I mean, you already have beats here in Century City.
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:13.840]   Why not buy the Sony lot?
[01:03:13.840 --> 01:03:14.960]   Why not?
[01:03:14.960 --> 01:03:18.000]   There's a lot of different ways that this could go.
[01:03:18.000 --> 01:03:21.280]   So for me, it feels like Apple very much like I agree with Mike.
[01:03:21.280 --> 01:03:24.320]   We're really dipping their toe in it to understand it fully.
[01:03:24.320 --> 01:03:27.920]   They've been so behind on media things for years though,
[01:03:27.920 --> 01:03:31.360]   in terms of Apple Music still not being anywhere near Spotify,
[01:03:31.360 --> 01:03:35.040]   in terms of calling Apple TVs, how many Apple TVs have tried and failed.
[01:03:35.040 --> 01:03:35.920]   It's about to pass Spotify.
[01:03:35.920 --> 01:03:38.320]   Apple Music is about to pass Spotify.
[01:03:38.320 --> 01:03:45.200]   I mean, I don't see that as a great product as much as they are on phones.
[01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:48.480]   I just mean the Apple TV and other things that Apple has never been a company
[01:03:48.480 --> 01:03:52.240]   that anyone in the mainstream, let alone us, Dorks would say,
[01:03:52.240 --> 01:03:54.560]   "Oh yeah, they really get it when it comes to media.
[01:03:54.560 --> 01:03:56.960]   They've really done well with the iOS App Store space."
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:59.280]   And that's where their services are kicking butt.
[01:03:59.280 --> 01:04:01.520]   And so I think it makes sense for them to-
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:02.080]   But even there are, there's problems.
[01:04:02.080 --> 01:04:03.760]   Yeah.
[01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:06.480]   Like even in the App Store, it's like Search is kind of a mess.
[01:04:06.480 --> 01:04:12.960]   It's hard for new developers to be noticed because you only get two to three apps now on your screen.
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:14.400]   It's just, it's hard.
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:20.400]   And Apple, I think, really, historically just isn't great at software experiences.
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:21.920]   And I think media is now-
[01:04:21.920 --> 01:04:22.560]   Oh, that's definitely-
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:24.160]   Media is now software.
[01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:30.080]   And so for me, it's very much like that experience that you have in your Apple TV.
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:33.760]   Apple ties into the experience you have watching an original show.
[01:04:33.760 --> 01:04:36.320]   Apple now has 36 million paid global users.
[01:04:36.320 --> 01:04:38.400]   That's up 6 million from September.
[01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:41.840]   Now Spotify is 70 million, but Apple Music is actually growing faster.
[01:04:41.840 --> 01:04:48.080]   The Wall Street Journal said yesterday they think that it's Apple is on track to actually overtake
[01:04:48.080 --> 01:04:50.000]   Spotify and US subscribers.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:54.000]   They've been growing, Apple's been growing 5% a month, Spotify 2% a month.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:54.880]   How long though?
[01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:56.080]   How long did they say it takes?
[01:04:56.080 --> 01:05:00.080]   Yeah, that's on track if the current trend stays exactly as it is, which it's not.
[01:05:00.080 --> 01:05:05.120]   I mean, they could either start kicking butt way faster or Spotify can shift to one of the two.
[01:05:05.120 --> 01:05:06.720]   I think they, well, look what-
[01:05:06.720 --> 01:05:11.120]   So one of the things that I think Apple wants to prop up Apple Music with is his original programming.
[01:05:11.120 --> 01:05:14.320]   They've done a deal with Steven Spielberg to bring back amazing stories.
[01:05:14.320 --> 01:05:17.760]   That's meh, but you know, it's a Spielberg, right?
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:22.880]   They bought a true crime bestseller called Are You Sleeping?
[01:05:22.880 --> 01:05:25.520]   Reese Witherspoon will produce it.
[01:05:25.520 --> 01:05:31.040]   It's being written by the woman who wrote The Good Wife and justified will start with star Octavia Spencer.
[01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:33.840]   I mean, are you thinking?
[01:05:33.840 --> 01:05:38.160]   I mean, this is Reese Witherspoon and Jennifer Aniston are going to star in a morning
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:40.960]   show drama, a morning talk show.
[01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:42.640]   This all looks super white.
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:44.320]   It is very white.
[01:05:44.320 --> 01:05:45.760]   This looks like a lot of white movies.
[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:48.240]   They are working with Dre to do a TV show too, right?
[01:05:48.240 --> 01:05:49.520]   Dre still work for Apple.
[01:05:49.520 --> 01:05:50.480]   He works for Beats.
[01:05:50.480 --> 01:05:52.240]   He works for Dre.
[01:05:52.240 --> 01:05:52.720]   He works for Dre.
[01:05:52.720 --> 01:05:53.840]   He looks like a forgotten guy.
[01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:54.080]   All right.
[01:05:54.080 --> 01:05:54.560]   How about this?
[01:05:54.560 --> 01:05:54.720]   Yeah.
[01:05:54.720 --> 01:05:55.680]   If you like,
[01:05:55.680 --> 01:05:58.000]   I fight a guy named Ronald D. Moore.
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:04.080]   He wrote the new battle star, the newer battle star Galatica co-executive produced Fargo with-
[01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:08.240]   No, the show will be co-executive produced by Matt Wohlpert and Ben Ndivy of Fargo.
[01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:13.520]   I mean, this is- they've got Kristen Wigg to do a comedy series.
[01:06:13.520 --> 01:06:15.200]   Clearly they got their finger in a media pie.
[01:06:15.200 --> 01:06:19.520]   I think it'd be really interesting if they combined Apple Music and a TV product and said,
[01:06:19.520 --> 01:06:20.960]   "Hey, you got your phone.
[01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:25.280]   Look, we're going to give you a free trial of this combined video audio service that
[01:06:25.280 --> 01:06:28.720]   Siri will control that you'll use your- I mean, they have an opportunity.
[01:06:28.720 --> 01:06:31.840]   They have their finger in enough pies to eventually go boom.
[01:06:31.840 --> 01:06:34.720]   Were that one thing just like they did with the iPod and the iPhone?
[01:06:34.720 --> 01:06:35.680]   They could.
[01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:39.040]   That's the nice thing about having that much money and that many eyeballs is that
[01:06:39.040 --> 01:06:42.240]   they aren't really that far away from coming up with that lightning crack.
[01:06:42.240 --> 01:06:43.840]   Even the watch is evidence of that.
[01:06:43.840 --> 01:06:47.920]   So, Dre's show will be called Vital Signs of Six-episode Miniseries.
[01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:51.360]   Okay, I'm not sure I'm going to enjoy this.
[01:06:51.360 --> 01:06:55.440]   Each one focuses on an emotion, vengeance, ego, negativity.
[01:06:55.440 --> 01:06:58.080]   In a sense, it's supposed to be semi-autobiographical.
[01:06:58.080 --> 01:06:59.840]   That's the old one.
[01:06:59.840 --> 01:07:05.200]   They've now hired Damian Chazelle, creator of La La Land in Whiplash.
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:12.400]   To do a series, they've got a- I mean, this is ambitious to say the least.
[01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:13.280]   This is Netflix.
[01:07:13.280 --> 01:07:15.520]   This is why I don't think they need to acquire Netflix.
[01:07:15.520 --> 01:07:19.040]   But here's the thing you can have these great shows, but the thing is,
[01:07:19.040 --> 01:07:24.960]   if the delivery vehicle is bad, if the platform experience, if the user experience is bad.
[01:07:24.960 --> 01:07:28.160]   Do you think Apple TV is a bad experience?
[01:07:28.160 --> 01:07:30.640]   Not necessarily, no.
[01:07:31.840 --> 01:07:36.640]   But I do think that- But I do think that- Amazon Apple TV and YouTube TV.
[01:07:36.640 --> 01:07:38.000]   YouTube TV is on it.
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:42.960]   And I just, this week, which means I can watch the Super Bowl on Apple TV.
[01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:43.600]   That's interesting.
[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:44.960]   I was shocked, actually, last night.
[01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:49.120]   I asked, I did a Siri voice search for a specific channel on YouTube,
[01:07:49.120 --> 01:07:51.120]   found it like that, nothing to it.
[01:07:51.120 --> 01:07:52.800]   I thought, wow, that's pretty great.
[01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:57.280]   I agree, Apple's been through a rough period, but I feel like the ecosystem
[01:07:57.280 --> 01:07:58.800]   play is starting to pay off.
[01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:01.680]   Also, let's not forget that list of-
[01:08:01.680 --> 01:08:02.160]   Right.
[01:08:02.160 --> 01:08:04.960]   The list, I just want to point out the list of all those shows you listed off.
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:08.400]   Those are just tentative and in the cloud.
[01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:12.000]   A lot of that's how many of those will actually become production shows
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.040]   is a whole another question.
[01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:15.040]   That's good for Apple to have all those things in a row.
[01:08:15.040 --> 01:08:17.760]   And when they go live, to be at least the year away, minimum.
[01:08:17.760 --> 01:08:20.000]   And that's if something's in production now.
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:26.480]   So, well, boy, I'm interested in seeing.
[01:08:26.480 --> 01:08:26.880]   We'll see.
[01:08:26.880 --> 01:08:28.720]   I can't imagine them buying Netflix.
[01:08:28.720 --> 01:08:33.520]   I feel like they are clearly showing that they want to invent it inside Apple.
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:33.920]   We want to do it.
[01:08:33.920 --> 01:08:36.800]   I have a hard time imagining Netflix wanting to sell.
[01:08:36.800 --> 01:08:37.840]   So that I would be interested.
[01:08:37.840 --> 01:08:39.280]   Well, you're throwing enough money at anybody.
[01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:39.520]   Right.
[01:08:39.520 --> 01:08:40.800]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:08:40.800 --> 01:08:41.920]   Everyone has a price.
[01:08:41.920 --> 01:08:42.720]   Let's take a break.
[01:08:42.720 --> 01:08:44.000]   We still have more to talk about.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:50.720]   Google's results are also in, not quite as rosy as Apple's, but we'll have something to say about that.
[01:08:50.720 --> 01:08:54.560]   Our show today brought to you by my mattress.
[01:08:55.440 --> 01:09:00.640]   Casper is an online retailer of premium mattresses for a fraction of the price
[01:09:00.640 --> 01:09:08.480]   made in the USA designed to create an exceptional sleep experience one night at a time.
[01:09:08.480 --> 01:09:15.840]   Casper's mattress is obsessively engineered to give you just the right support, just the right
[01:09:15.840 --> 01:09:17.360]   sink, just the right bounce.
[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:21.040]   Plus, it's breathable, which helps you sleep cool.
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:25.040]   I have to say, once I started sleeping on a Casper, I never had another one of those
[01:09:25.040 --> 01:09:28.960]   sweaty nights, which you hate, even in the winter, more even in the winter, because of heat in the
[01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:31.760]   house, regulate your temperature throughout the night.
[01:09:31.760 --> 01:09:34.320]   A Casper mattress is long lasting.
[01:09:34.320 --> 01:09:35.120]   It's comfortable.
[01:09:35.120 --> 01:09:36.960]   You can buy it easily online.
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:37.360]   I know.
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:37.840]   Wait a minute.
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:39.680]   You're saying, oh, but I want to try it first.
[01:09:39.680 --> 01:09:43.840]   You can in your house at night for 100 nights.
[01:09:43.840 --> 01:09:48.960]   There's no risk at all free delivery, painless returns within a 100 day period.
[01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:51.760]   If at any point in that 100 days, you say, I like my own mattress.
[01:09:52.320 --> 01:09:54.080]   They'll take the Casper away.
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:55.280]   They'll refund you every penny.
[01:09:55.280 --> 01:09:59.040]   Casper mattresses uphold the highest environmental production standards.
[01:09:59.040 --> 01:10:00.080]   They're made in the US.
[01:10:00.080 --> 01:10:02.800]   You open the box surprisingly compact.
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:05.120]   It goes, "Shh, and there's your mattress.
[01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:05.760]   Smells great.
[01:10:05.760 --> 01:10:06.960]   I have had other mattresses.
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:11.440]   I've had to air out for a long time before I really liked the smell."
[01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:11.920]   Right?
[01:10:11.920 --> 01:10:12.240]   No.
[01:10:12.240 --> 01:10:15.360]   I don't know how they do it, but Casper is fresh from day one.
[01:10:15.360 --> 01:10:19.360]   Free shipping and returns in the US, Canada, and the UK now.

[01:10:42.800 --> 01:10:45.440]   If you don't, no harm, no foul.

[01:10:49.200 --> 01:10:51.200]   Nobody sends back their Casper mattress.
[01:10:51.200 --> 01:10:51.840]   You know what?
[01:10:51.840 --> 01:10:56.800]   Have you spent your entire night climbing, trying to climb
[01:10:56.800 --> 01:10:58.480]   telephone poles in Philadelphia?
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:10:59.440]   They're so slippery.
[01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:00.400]   Are you exhausted?
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:01.360]   Why did they get so slippery?
[01:11:01.360 --> 01:11:01.840]   They get so slippery.
[01:11:01.840 --> 01:11:03.040]   It's a Casper mattress.
[01:11:03.040 --> 01:11:04.800]   They get so slippery.
[01:11:04.800 --> 01:11:06.480]   See, you know how to do that.
[01:11:06.480 --> 01:11:07.600]   That's a good ad pitch.
[01:11:07.600 --> 01:11:08.560]   You know how to do that.
[01:11:08.560 --> 01:11:09.440]   That's good, Dashley.
[01:11:09.440 --> 01:11:10.080]   I appreciate that.
[01:11:10.080 --> 01:11:15.440]   So, Alphabet has a new chairman, John Hennessy,
[01:11:17.280 --> 01:11:20.000]   chairman of the board, I guess, replacing Eric Schmidt.
[01:11:20.000 --> 01:11:21.440]   He left last year.
[01:11:21.440 --> 01:11:22.320]   Don't know who he is.
[01:11:22.320 --> 01:11:23.680]   Does it matter?
[01:11:23.680 --> 01:11:25.360]   The center of liquor, Hennessy.
[01:11:25.360 --> 01:11:25.840]   I'm kidding.
[01:11:25.840 --> 01:11:26.480]   I have no idea.
[01:11:26.480 --> 01:11:27.920]   That's not probably not accurate.
[01:11:27.920 --> 01:11:29.360]   He could be a brandy mogul.
[01:11:29.360 --> 01:11:30.000]   He could be.
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:30.480]   We don't know.
[01:11:30.480 --> 01:11:34.800]   Does it feel like the whole Alphabet thing was a big flop?
[01:11:34.800 --> 01:11:35.440]   Yes.
[01:11:35.440 --> 01:11:38.640]   I think the press has trouble even using the A word.
[01:11:38.640 --> 01:11:41.120]   It's like everybody wants to call everybody Google.
[01:11:41.120 --> 01:11:42.160]   It's a big problem.
[01:11:42.160 --> 01:11:42.960]   It's complicated.
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:44.480]   Nobody cares about this results.
[01:11:44.480 --> 01:11:46.240]   We say it's kind of like the Google results.
[01:11:46.240 --> 01:11:46.880]   Exactly.
[01:11:46.880 --> 01:11:47.440]   Right.
[01:11:47.440 --> 01:11:50.640]   I just wrote a piece where I was talking about Waymo.
[01:11:50.640 --> 01:11:52.080]   And you got to say right off the front,
[01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:53.360]   you're formerly Google, blah, blah, blah.
[01:11:53.360 --> 01:11:55.440]   It's a big, it's a long story because
[01:11:55.440 --> 01:12:00.080]   the fact that it hasn't gelled or hasn't been accepted by the public somehow.
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:04.640]   Well, the reason is if they need other divisions to do the evil that Google cannot.
[01:12:04.640 --> 01:12:07.680]   That's so awesome, true.
[01:12:07.680 --> 01:12:08.960]   That's a good point.
[01:12:08.960 --> 01:12:09.760]   Right.
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:10.800]   Good point.
[01:12:10.800 --> 01:12:12.720]   If you look at the fine print on their various websites,
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:13.920]   it's like kind of evil.
[01:12:13.920 --> 01:12:15.040]   You know, yeah, more evil.
[01:12:15.040 --> 01:12:15.520]   Maybe that's so.
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:16.160]   Maybe that's sometimes.
[01:12:16.160 --> 01:12:16.400]   Yeah.
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:22.640]   Revenue was up beat the street 24% year over year, but earnings were down.
[01:12:22.640 --> 01:12:28.240]   And they underperformed the estimates, which means the stock took a hit, of course.
[01:12:28.240 --> 01:12:33.600]   Earnings were $9 per, $9.70 per share, revenue $4.7 billion.
[01:12:33.600 --> 01:12:38.000]   The other bets, which are everything but Google $409 million.
[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:46.160]   Paid clicks up 43%, but year over year, the cost per click went down 14% per quarter,
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:46.400]   6%.
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:47.920]   Is that worrisome?
[01:12:47.920 --> 01:12:50.000]   What's the difference in paid?
[01:12:50.000 --> 01:12:51.200]   I don't understand that.
[01:12:51.200 --> 01:12:54.000]   I don't even understand the nomenclature here.
[01:12:54.000 --> 01:12:58.160]   Paid clicks up 43% cost per click.
[01:12:58.160 --> 01:13:03.920]   Oh, so they sold more ads, but the amount of money they made per click went down.
[01:13:03.920 --> 01:13:08.640]   Because of competition, no doubt from Facebook and Amazon.
[01:13:08.640 --> 01:13:15.360]   You have to think both of those prevent present real issues for Facebook.
[01:13:15.360 --> 01:13:20.320]   I mean, for Google or Alphabet or whatever the hell they call it these days.
[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:22.400]   The traffic.
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:23.760]   So hard to explain that to people.
[01:13:23.760 --> 01:13:25.440]   It's the worst.
[01:13:25.440 --> 01:13:28.880]   Oh, it's alphabet, but it's really Google.
[01:13:28.880 --> 01:13:30.320]   Sorry.
[01:13:30.320 --> 01:13:35.520]   There's a number of tech crunch says you should pay attention to TAC, TAC,
[01:13:35.520 --> 01:13:37.280]   which is traffic acquisition.
[01:13:37.280 --> 01:13:41.360]   How much they spend to get traffic as a percentage of revenue.
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:43.120]   It's going up.
[01:13:43.120 --> 01:13:49.200]   It's getting harder to get people to do their business thing.
[01:13:49.200 --> 01:13:50.560]   Interesting.
[01:13:50.560 --> 01:13:51.120]   Go along with their agency.
[01:13:51.120 --> 01:13:53.920]   They have to spend more money to get the same amount of people.
[01:13:53.920 --> 01:13:54.400]   Yeah.
[01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:56.400]   That's probably, I mean, that's like you said, Mike.
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:59.920]   It's definitely due to competition from sites like Facebook.
[01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:04.800]   TechCrunch, Matthew Lindley says it's a fourth quarter whiff.
[01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:06.560]   I don't, is it that bad?
[01:14:06.560 --> 01:14:12.560]   Net loss, but most of that's the $9.9 billion they paid in taxes.
[01:14:12.560 --> 01:14:14.720]   That's where the loss really came from.
[01:14:14.720 --> 01:14:18.560]   I think the most interesting way to think about Alphabet is that Google itself,
[01:14:18.560 --> 01:14:22.480]   you talked about this on Twig, is become a boring company.
[01:14:22.480 --> 01:14:23.120]   It's boring.
[01:14:23.120 --> 01:14:24.880]   Not an Elon Musk, you know what I mean.
[01:14:24.880 --> 01:14:30.560]   And I think that seems to be a buy design because the CEO
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:36.880]   what's his name, a blanket on CEO's name, he's a boring guy.
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:40.000]   I mean, he's a, he's a keep the trains running on time kind of a person.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:40.880]   He's not a visionary.
[01:14:40.880 --> 01:14:42.480]   He's not a risk taker.
[01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:46.320]   And then meanwhile, I think what's interesting though is that the long-term
[01:14:46.320 --> 01:14:49.760]   prospects for Alphabet are massive.
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:52.240]   The stuff they're doing in biotech and all this other stuff,
[01:14:52.240 --> 01:14:55.600]   this is going to pay off in five, 10, 15 years.
[01:14:55.600 --> 01:15:00.160]   I think they, you know, reversing what I said about the mistake of Alphabet before.
[01:15:00.160 --> 01:15:03.680]   I think the seeds that they're planning now are going to be redwood forests
[01:15:03.680 --> 01:15:06.480]   and they're going to be huge in the future.
[01:15:06.480 --> 01:15:09.120]   I think there's going to be a Lolish period over the next five years.
[01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:09.120]   All right.
[01:15:09.120 --> 01:15:10.000]   So you're bullish.
[01:15:10.000 --> 01:15:11.040]   I'm super bullish.
[01:15:11.040 --> 01:15:11.280]   Yeah.
[01:15:11.280 --> 01:15:12.240]   Well, the Lol...
[01:15:12.240 --> 01:15:15.280]   The present term Lol, they need it.
[01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:18.320]   They need a real butt-kicker of a smartphone to fill that gap.
[01:15:18.320 --> 01:15:22.640]   And we know that they've got HTC maybe not being a terrible company.
[01:15:22.640 --> 01:15:23.120]   That they do.
[01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:23.600]   They'll close.
[01:15:23.600 --> 01:15:26.320]   They spend a billion plus for 2,000 engineers,
[01:15:26.320 --> 01:15:27.680]   the engineers who built the Pixel.
[01:15:28.240 --> 01:15:31.680]   And if they can make, you know, the Pixel picked up a little bit of buzz,
[01:15:31.680 --> 01:15:33.120]   but also had some launch issues.
[01:15:33.120 --> 01:15:37.040]   If they get a Pixel 3 out that isn't garbage, you know, there's,
[01:15:37.040 --> 01:15:41.440]   I don't, I think there's enough room in all of the smartphone landscapes
[01:15:41.440 --> 01:15:43.840]   where loyalty can be chipped away at.
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:47.360]   And if they can just really get out there and get either something affordable
[01:15:47.360 --> 01:15:51.200]   with the best camera in the world or something that, you know, laser scans your face
[01:15:51.200 --> 01:15:53.600]   and gives you a free puppy, I don't know what it'll take,
[01:15:53.600 --> 01:15:58.160]   but there's still room for them to essentially get super aggressive
[01:15:58.160 --> 01:16:01.920]   in the hardware master space that they're going for now.
[01:16:01.920 --> 01:16:04.960]   Now that they're no longer doing the nexus thing of saying,
[01:16:04.960 --> 01:16:08.960]   you guys make this thing and we'll give it a better version of vanilla Android.
[01:16:08.960 --> 01:16:09.760]   There's no vision.
[01:16:09.760 --> 01:16:13.280]   I mean, all this stuff about bimodarola, cell modarola, bi-HDC.
[01:16:13.280 --> 01:16:15.920]   So it's like, you know, look at what Apple did.
[01:16:15.920 --> 01:16:19.040]   They claimed to have invented the touch phone and they just spent on a,
[01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:22.160]   on a, on a trajectory into space ever since.
[01:16:22.160 --> 01:16:22.800]   Very solid.
[01:16:22.800 --> 01:16:25.280]   You never thought, well, maybe Apple get out of the phone business.
[01:16:25.280 --> 01:16:27.440]   No, there's no, there's no confusion.
[01:16:27.440 --> 01:16:27.920]   Yeah.
[01:16:27.920 --> 01:16:31.440]   And, and people need to pick a strategy and stick to it to the end.
[01:16:31.440 --> 01:16:33.680]   Otherwise, it's going to be problematic.
[01:16:33.680 --> 01:16:35.360]   Is Corona hard?
[01:16:35.360 --> 01:16:36.480]   Go ahead. I'm sorry, Ashley.
[01:16:36.480 --> 01:16:37.120]   Go ahead.
[01:16:37.120 --> 01:16:38.240]   I was, it's okay.
[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:38.720]   Thank you.
[01:16:38.720 --> 01:16:40.480]   Um, I was, I'm just curious, Mike.
[01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:45.840]   Like, do you think that Google now owning the smartphone division of HCC,
[01:16:45.840 --> 01:16:51.360]   these, these 2000 engineers who made the Pixel 2, um, do you think that now,
[01:16:51.360 --> 01:16:55.600]   sort of them owning the vertical both in the way of the software,
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:17:00.080]   the, the, now the hardware, like they are going to sort of own that process?
[01:17:00.080 --> 01:17:05.600]   Do you think that it might result in a phone that people are more compelled to buy?
[01:17:05.600 --> 01:17:10.400]   Because they trust it more in the same vein as like people who buy iPhones tend to trust
[01:17:10.400 --> 01:17:12.080]   Apple because they own that vertical.
[01:17:12.080 --> 01:17:16.640]   They own that space and it does feel like Google is sort of finally taking that page
[01:17:16.640 --> 01:17:19.760]   and saying, oh yeah, we should probably just own the vertical here.
[01:17:19.760 --> 01:17:20.320]   No, I don't.
[01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:23.600]   I, I don't think, I, you know, I hate to say it in the present company,
[01:17:23.600 --> 01:17:28.320]   but I don't think the public, the phone buying public pays that much attention to the
[01:17:28.320 --> 01:17:29.520]   minutia of tech news.
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:34.800]   I think what would, what will do, do the trick is if they, they have a stellar reputation
[01:17:34.800 --> 01:17:39.760]   year after year for three or four years and then the conventional wisdom becomes,
[01:17:39.760 --> 01:17:41.440]   yeah, Google's phones are amazing.
[01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:42.800]   That becomes incredible.
[01:17:42.800 --> 01:17:45.280]   Because at least in the US, and that's very different around the world,
[01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:48.720]   but in the US, what really matters is you go into the phone store.
[01:17:49.440 --> 01:17:53.600]   And the guy says, well, we have this iPhone X, we have this iPhone eight,
[01:17:53.600 --> 01:17:56.880]   and we have the Samsung S8 or soon to be S9.
[01:17:56.880 --> 01:17:59.680]   And they don't mention the Google phone.
[01:17:59.680 --> 01:18:00.080]   Yeah.
[01:18:00.080 --> 01:18:04.160]   This killed Microsoft because they would, you could never get Verizon to mention a Windows
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:05.200]   phone to save your life.
[01:18:05.200 --> 01:18:06.000]   I recommend it.
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:06.320]   Right.
[01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:07.360]   Put them right out of business.
[01:18:07.360 --> 01:18:08.880]   They put BlackBerry out of business.
[01:18:08.880 --> 01:18:15.280]   You know, Huawei is even admitting this that when they, they just lost both Verizon and AT&T
[01:18:15.280 --> 01:18:18.240]   as carriers for their Honor A, they're made eight, made 10.
[01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:18.240]   Yeah.
[01:18:18.240 --> 01:18:19.840]   And they said, that's it.
[01:18:19.840 --> 01:18:24.720]   We're going to sell it, but it won't be a cannot win in the US without carrier support.
[01:18:24.720 --> 01:18:26.560]   My argument, I don't think that carriers off.
[01:18:26.560 --> 01:18:32.080]   I mean, I went into the T-Mobile store and yeah, you see a Pixel 2, but I don't know if they really
[01:18:32.080 --> 01:18:32.880]   push it.
[01:18:32.880 --> 01:18:34.560]   I think nobody's hard pushing it.
[01:18:34.560 --> 01:18:41.040]   Pixel 2 set, I think the table a little bit to get people who buzz about and write about
[01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:44.800]   and vlog about gadgets to say the Pixel 2 is a thing.
[01:18:44.800 --> 01:18:46.240]   We weren't hearing that about the Pixel.
[01:18:46.240 --> 01:18:52.000]   I just know all the review roundups I saw last year, those sort of quote unquote influencers
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:54.880]   were really actually picking up on the Pixel 2 for whatever it was.
[01:18:54.880 --> 01:18:55.360]   It's set, Sam.
[01:18:55.360 --> 01:18:55.840]   Yeah.
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:19:00.000]   Except Sam, the lasting impression most people have is it had a burning on the screen.
[01:19:00.000 --> 01:19:02.560]   That there were issues with it, right?
[01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:04.160]   Isn't that what most people are going to say?
[01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:08.800]   And I think my question really is the table setting that I'm talking about, that I really did see
[01:19:08.800 --> 01:19:12.400]   play out in November and December when people were picking out Christmas gifts.
[01:19:12.400 --> 01:19:14.160]   Did that leave the impression?
[01:19:14.160 --> 01:19:19.120]   And whatever the next pixel is, we will see that unfold, whether that does get into
[01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:22.160]   that very short sentence of what the dude at the store says.
[01:19:22.160 --> 01:19:27.520]   So the Pixel 3 or whatever it is is sort of the last shot right now in that Google needs
[01:19:27.520 --> 01:19:29.200]   to be bullish thing that we're talking about.
[01:19:29.200 --> 01:19:36.400]   This is their real shot of having a right now, hey, we matter in smartphones way, as opposed to the,
[01:19:36.400 --> 01:19:38.240]   they're not really doing anything interesting way.
[01:19:38.240 --> 01:19:42.560]   That's, there's a little bit of a gap for the next four or five months that they have an opportunity
[01:19:42.560 --> 01:19:47.360]   to fill. And I think going bullish on HTC might set them up to do something with that,
[01:19:47.360 --> 01:19:48.720]   but it's all question marks right now.
[01:19:48.720 --> 01:19:50.000]   So here's my question.
[01:19:50.000 --> 01:19:52.480]   Is hardware really that important to Google?
[01:19:52.480 --> 01:19:55.920]   That is, I don't know if, is it important billion?
[01:19:55.920 --> 01:19:57.600]   That's nothing.
[01:19:57.600 --> 01:19:58.800]   They may, what was their revenue?
[01:19:58.800 --> 01:20:00.800]   I mean, it's a fraction of their revenue.
[01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:02.240]   Right. So I mean, you take that number.
[01:20:02.240 --> 01:20:03.200]   But to have that data,
[01:20:03.200 --> 01:20:09.760]   hardware has to be important because of the data they can get by having more and more users using
[01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:15.360]   pixel phones. Like to me, that's for them, that is the more valuable bit.
[01:20:15.360 --> 01:20:17.440]   But to get that, they have to,
[01:20:17.440 --> 01:20:19.920]   hardware has to matter to them.
[01:20:19.920 --> 01:20:22.880]   We were talking on the radio show about movie pass.
[01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:27.200]   You know, this is the company that sells you for 10 bucks a month or a hundred bucks a year,
[01:20:27.200 --> 01:20:32.320]   unlimited movie tickets, which makes no sense because they pay the full freight for the tickets.
[01:20:32.320 --> 01:20:37.680]   And where they make it up is they, you have to install the movie pass app on your phone.
[01:20:37.680 --> 01:20:41.280]   They collect data that is very valuable.
[01:20:41.280 --> 01:20:42.800]   They know a lot about you.
[01:20:42.800 --> 01:20:46.560]   They can use that data in selling marketing to movie companies.
[01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:51.760]   They're even now, he said at Sundance, the CEO said, "Sundance, we're going to start buying movies."
[01:20:51.760 --> 01:20:55.360]   And it's all because of the marketing data they have from you using that app.
[01:20:55.360 --> 01:20:56.560]   So you're absolutely right.
[01:20:56.560 --> 01:21:01.440]   The data that Google gets from a pixel phone is so valuable.
[01:21:01.440 --> 01:21:05.280]   But then you have to ask, well, why are they selling these phones at such a premium price?
[01:21:05.280 --> 01:21:07.440]   Going full circle, this is what Nielsen should do.
[01:21:07.440 --> 01:21:13.920]   Nielsen should have an app that gives you wild discounts on various paid TV,
[01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:15.760]   like maybe Apple TV, whatever it is.
[01:21:15.760 --> 01:21:18.240]   And then they should, as part of the permission process,
[01:21:18.240 --> 01:21:21.520]   - They should give it away. - Let us listen through your phone and watch your watching.
[01:21:21.520 --> 01:21:23.600]   - Oh, they already do that. - So they already do that, I think.
[01:21:23.600 --> 01:21:25.040]   - Yeah, I thought they already had something about that.
[01:21:25.040 --> 01:21:26.000]   - Some apps are listening.
[01:21:26.000 --> 01:21:30.560]   Tivo, you know, not only sells the data about what you watch in the Tivo,
[01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:34.320]   but even what you rewound when you're interested.
[01:21:34.320 --> 01:21:36.880]   - Yeah, everything that you do, the Tivo.
[01:21:36.880 --> 01:21:37.760]   - It's like YouTube.
[01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:39.520]   - Yeah, YouTube knows all that, sure.
[01:21:39.520 --> 01:21:43.200]   And that was my original contention is that in the long run Amazon and Facebook,
[01:21:43.200 --> 01:21:48.320]   and Google, Amazon probably second to Google and Facebook,
[01:21:48.320 --> 01:21:50.400]   have a huge insight track on advertising.
[01:21:50.400 --> 01:21:52.320]   And that's really a lot of revenue.
[01:21:52.320 --> 01:21:53.200]   That's going to drive a lot of--
[01:21:53.200 --> 01:21:56.640]   - Amazon is going to catch up though with all of the devices,
[01:21:56.640 --> 01:21:59.600]   - It aren't things. - The home assistant devices that they're selling.
[01:21:59.600 --> 01:22:05.040]   And the other thing is, so there was a story a while back about how Amazon was working on
[01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:09.040]   having putting ads into the Echo, right?
[01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:11.680]   And so people were like freaking out on Twitter and everything.
[01:22:11.680 --> 01:22:17.600]   And all I could think was it would make sense if Amazon implemented that very similarly to
[01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:22.480]   how they do the Kindle, which is to say, if you want to get an Echo Dot,
[01:22:22.480 --> 01:22:25.440]   that'll cost you, you know, 50 bucks.
[01:22:25.440 --> 01:22:29.040]   But if you want to get one with ads, well, if you have an Amazon Prime membership,
[01:22:29.040 --> 01:22:30.640]   we'll send it to you for free.
[01:22:30.640 --> 01:22:32.480]   - Yep, even more than that. - And then they can all that data.
[01:22:32.480 --> 01:22:34.800]   - Even more than that. - Even all that data.
[01:22:34.800 --> 01:22:36.400]   - Go ahead. I'm sorry.
[01:22:36.400 --> 01:22:40.080]   - It's just, it's such a good, it would be such a like brilliant thing on their part.
[01:22:40.080 --> 01:22:43.280]   It's kind of gross, but like because they're, you know, they want your information.
[01:22:43.280 --> 01:22:45.200]   But the thing is, is some people are willing to trade that?
[01:22:45.200 --> 01:22:46.880]   That is an okay trade for them.
[01:22:46.880 --> 01:22:52.400]   - Even more than that, if you're Google and Amazon and Facebook,
[01:22:52.400 --> 01:22:55.680]   you're not looking at today or next year, you're looking down the road.
[01:22:55.680 --> 01:22:56.640]   - Right.
[01:22:56.640 --> 01:23:00.960]   - The battle right now, I think, is joined between Google and Amazon over,
[01:23:00.960 --> 01:23:02.720]   what will replace the smartphone?
[01:23:02.720 --> 01:23:06.640]   Over wearables and over voice assistants.
[01:23:06.640 --> 01:23:15.200]   And Amazon's great lead with Echo right now is something they need to capitalize on right now.
[01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:20.640]   You have, I love, I love your headline in ours, Technica, Sam Masgovic, Alexa,
[01:23:20.640 --> 01:23:25.840]   Print Money, even Bezos stunned by Amazon's Q4 income.
[01:23:25.840 --> 01:23:27.840]   We'll talk about that in just a second.
[01:23:27.840 --> 01:23:34.400]   I really think the battle is shaping up over voice, over wearables, Google and Amazon, right?
[01:23:34.400 --> 01:23:38.560]   And Apple is a, is a distant, I mean, I'm gonna get my home pod in a few days,
[01:23:38.560 --> 01:23:41.200]   but it's really not a competitor at this point.
[01:23:41.200 --> 01:23:42.640]   - Right. I skipped it.
[01:23:42.640 --> 01:23:45.040]   - Yeah, I have to get it. I probably would have skipped it.
[01:23:45.040 --> 01:23:45.680]   - Yeah.
[01:23:45.680 --> 01:23:46.160]   - Although--
[01:23:46.160 --> 01:23:47.360]   - Zero is not good enough yet.
[01:23:47.360 --> 01:23:47.760]   - Although--
[01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:48.240]   - Although--
[01:23:48.240 --> 01:23:48.800]   - I don't--
[01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:50.960]   I'm not gonna bet against Apple's ecosystem play.
[01:23:50.960 --> 01:23:53.840]   So you have to use Apple Music.
[01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:57.040]   You got the Apple Watch, the Apple Watch got me to use the Apple Phone more,
[01:23:57.040 --> 01:24:00.800]   the Apple Phone got me to use the iPad more, the iPad got me to use the Mac more,
[01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:04.240]   the Home pods are gonna get me to use Apple Music more, the Apple TV.
[01:24:04.240 --> 01:24:06.960]   It's all starting to congeal.
[01:24:06.960 --> 01:24:07.600]   - Right.
[01:24:07.600 --> 01:24:08.400]   - Yeah.
[01:24:08.400 --> 01:24:09.440]   - And set--
[01:24:09.440 --> 01:24:10.320]   - No, that's a good point.
[01:24:10.320 --> 01:24:12.560]   And a lot of people really love that.
[01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:14.960]   They want it to be a seamless, easy experience.
[01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:18.880]   And if Apple can give that to people, then good on them.
[01:24:18.880 --> 01:24:22.000]   Like, I can't argue with that.
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:23.280]   I think that's a good idea.
[01:24:23.280 --> 01:24:25.120]   I've been trying to stay like,
[01:24:25.120 --> 01:24:27.040]   slightly platform agnostic,
[01:24:27.040 --> 01:24:29.040]   and I have Sonos in my house.
[01:24:29.040 --> 01:24:30.800]   Like, that's like my jam.
[01:24:30.800 --> 01:24:32.560]   And so I've been--
[01:24:32.560 --> 01:24:36.800]   I haven't tried out the new play one where they have--
[01:24:36.800 --> 01:24:39.760]   or the Sonos one where they have the voice assistant availability in it.
[01:24:39.760 --> 01:24:44.800]   But yeah, I'm very curious as to--
[01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:48.720]   how that speaker, because it is expensive for people.
[01:24:48.720 --> 01:24:54.400]   And so how that speaker will do on the market compared to other speakers,
[01:24:54.400 --> 01:24:57.280]   is it-- is audio quality that important to people
[01:24:57.280 --> 01:25:02.320]   that they're willing to spend $400 as opposed to $79 for an Apple?
[01:25:02.320 --> 01:25:02.800]   - That's not the issue.
[01:25:02.800 --> 01:25:03.360]   That's not the--
[01:25:03.360 --> 01:25:05.920]   Apple's always the exception in these things.
[01:25:05.920 --> 01:25:08.800]   It's not really a comparison between one speaker and another speaker.
[01:25:08.800 --> 01:25:09.200]   - Right.
[01:25:09.200 --> 01:25:14.240]   - Apple has this little market where people who love Apple buy all the Apple--
[01:25:14.240 --> 01:25:14.800]   - Apple's.
[01:25:14.800 --> 01:25:17.040]   - And guess what? That's half the global market.
[01:25:17.040 --> 01:25:18.560]   - And they're relatively price-sensitive.
[01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:18.560]   - Yeah.
[01:25:18.560 --> 01:25:21.760]   - I mean, I think Apple can say iPhone 10,
[01:25:21.760 --> 01:25:24.480]   price maybe knocked that sales down a little bit.
[01:25:24.480 --> 01:25:25.440]   They're watching that though.
[01:25:25.440 --> 01:25:26.240]   - Still worth it.
[01:25:26.240 --> 01:25:26.800]   - Yeah.
[01:25:26.800 --> 01:25:27.200]   - Well, that's--
[01:25:27.200 --> 01:25:29.200]   - I was like, you said, like, 1% was that--
[01:25:29.200 --> 01:25:32.480]   - They're selling less iPhones but at $1,000 a piece.
[01:25:32.480 --> 01:25:32.960]   - Yes.
[01:25:32.960 --> 01:25:34.080]   - And they're making more money.
[01:25:34.080 --> 01:25:34.880]   - Yes.
[01:25:34.880 --> 01:25:37.920]   - I could see the HomePod having an Apple Watch trajectory,
[01:25:37.920 --> 01:25:38.800]   because we're talking--
[01:25:38.800 --> 01:25:38.960]   - Yes, exactly.
[01:25:38.960 --> 01:25:40.720]   - How many of you guys have those on your wrists today?
[01:25:40.720 --> 01:25:42.320]   That was not the case when it first came out.
[01:25:42.320 --> 01:25:43.360]   So that could be a thing.
[01:25:43.360 --> 01:25:46.080]   I do want to say when we talk about speech being a big platform
[01:25:46.080 --> 01:25:48.880]   of watching us and all of our data and which companies are there,
[01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:51.840]   let's not forget Facebook owning Oculus.
[01:25:51.840 --> 01:25:54.800]   Oculus is not about virtual reality bulky headsets for them.
[01:25:54.800 --> 01:25:56.400]   That is not the play.
[01:25:56.400 --> 01:25:59.600]   Oculus is about the giant research team that is interested
[01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:02.800]   in how we look at and how we listen to data.
[01:26:02.800 --> 01:26:05.840]   They have crazy stuff going on at their offices
[01:26:05.840 --> 01:26:07.120]   in terms of building out something.
[01:26:07.120 --> 01:26:10.240]   We talk about at play for the future of how we access
[01:26:10.240 --> 01:26:13.760]   our digital world with voice, with augmented things.
[01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:16.080]   And Apple definitely has a play in augmented reality
[01:26:16.080 --> 01:26:16.960]   in terms of phone play.
[01:26:16.960 --> 01:26:19.120]   But that is going to also be huge.
[01:26:19.120 --> 01:26:21.280]   And that is going to be something that doesn't play out right now
[01:26:21.280 --> 01:26:23.600]   because people think of augmented and virtual reality
[01:26:23.600 --> 01:26:25.920]   as bulky, inconvenient stuff.
[01:26:25.920 --> 01:26:28.400]   That will change and every company sees it that way.
[01:26:28.400 --> 01:26:29.200]   And so does Amazon.
[01:26:29.200 --> 01:26:30.400]   - I think you're exactly right.
[01:26:30.400 --> 01:26:31.040]   In fact, that's--
[01:26:31.040 --> 01:26:31.840]   - Yeah, got it.
[01:26:31.840 --> 01:26:33.760]   - Since we said the next thing is what matters,
[01:26:33.760 --> 01:26:35.200]   the only--
[01:26:35.200 --> 01:26:37.520]   Apple's got to find a successor to the iPhone.
[01:26:37.520 --> 01:26:37.920]   - Yeah.
[01:26:37.920 --> 01:26:39.280]   - And AR is going to be--
[01:26:39.280 --> 01:26:40.320]   is it, right?
[01:26:40.320 --> 01:26:41.360]   - Yeah, it's glasses.
[01:26:41.360 --> 01:26:42.240]   - It's glasses.
[01:26:42.240 --> 01:26:44.400]   - Or maybe, herables as well.
[01:26:44.400 --> 01:26:45.760]   - Right.
[01:26:45.760 --> 01:26:48.080]   And the glasses will absolutely be--
[01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:50.080]   Siri will be right there all the time when you're working.
[01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:51.520]   - But can it be glasses?
[01:26:51.520 --> 01:26:52.320]   Because--
[01:26:52.320 --> 01:26:53.760]   - I don't think it's going to be glasses.
[01:26:53.760 --> 01:26:54.320]   - I wear glasses.
[01:26:54.320 --> 01:26:56.800]   - And I don't want to switch to some dorky,
[01:26:56.800 --> 01:26:58.240]   like Google Glass looking thing.
[01:26:58.240 --> 01:26:59.120]   Like, I don't want that.
[01:26:59.120 --> 01:26:59.760]   I want to be able--
[01:26:59.760 --> 01:27:00.880]   If you have a technology,
[01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:03.600]   I can get installed into my frames.
[01:27:03.600 --> 01:27:05.360]   - That's exactly what they're doing.
[01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:06.480]   If you look at--
[01:27:06.480 --> 01:27:08.720]   Apple's been rumored to be partnering
[01:27:08.720 --> 01:27:11.680]   for some time with Carl Zeiss,
[01:27:11.680 --> 01:27:13.520]   which has the in lens.
[01:27:13.520 --> 01:27:15.520]   It looks like they look kind of like bifocals.
[01:27:15.520 --> 01:27:17.680]   And other technologies like that.
[01:27:17.680 --> 01:27:19.920]   I mean, absolutely, you're right.
[01:27:19.920 --> 01:27:21.360]   When it's not going to break
[01:27:21.360 --> 01:27:22.960]   until they look like regular glasses,
[01:27:22.960 --> 01:27:24.160]   but that is going to happen.
[01:27:24.160 --> 01:27:25.920]   It probably will happen in seven or eight years.
[01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:29.040]   - I don't think it's not even that it's not going to break
[01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:31.120]   when they have to look like normal glasses.
[01:27:31.120 --> 01:27:34.000]   It's going to break when you can put them
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:35.920]   in any frame that you want.
[01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:36.960]   - Yes, here's my bet.
[01:27:36.960 --> 01:27:37.800]   - Here's my bet is--
[01:27:37.800 --> 01:27:38.640]   - Here's my bet is--
[01:27:38.640 --> 01:27:41.120]   - My bet is not everybody likes to wear glasses,
[01:27:41.120 --> 01:27:42.640]   but everyone likes to wear headphones.
[01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:43.760]   So mark my words,
[01:27:43.760 --> 01:27:45.200]   the tech that we're all going to have
[01:27:45.200 --> 01:27:46.880]   that's going to do augmented things
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:48.480]   and listening to us all the time
[01:27:48.480 --> 01:27:50.480]   will fit conveniently on our ears.
[01:27:50.480 --> 01:27:51.520]   That's my bet.
[01:27:51.520 --> 01:27:54.720]   - But see, all the conversations
[01:27:54.720 --> 01:27:56.720]   that everybody has about augmented reality
[01:27:56.720 --> 01:27:58.720]   are based on not really knowing
[01:27:58.720 --> 01:28:00.480]   what the future of augmented reality
[01:28:00.480 --> 01:28:02.160]   will be like as an experience.
[01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:03.520]   It's going to be completely great.
[01:28:03.520 --> 01:28:05.040]   It's going to be completely mind-blowing.
[01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:07.280]   And everybody is going to wear glasses.
[01:28:07.280 --> 01:28:08.800]   Even people with 20, 20 vision,
[01:28:08.800 --> 01:28:10.640]   everybody's going to want to wear glasses
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:11.440]   in five years or seven.
[01:28:11.440 --> 01:28:12.400]   - I think it's going to be a rejection.
[01:28:12.400 --> 01:28:13.840]   I think it's going to be more holographic
[01:28:13.840 --> 01:28:15.120]   coming off of something that you can just
[01:28:15.120 --> 01:28:15.920]   clip onto in here.
[01:28:15.920 --> 01:28:17.200]   That's my bet.
[01:28:17.200 --> 01:28:19.440]   - Eventually, I mean, the first step is to have glasses
[01:28:19.440 --> 01:28:20.640]   that don't look totally horrible.
[01:28:20.640 --> 01:28:21.760]   But like 15 years ago,
[01:28:21.760 --> 01:28:23.280]   everybody wasn't wearing air,
[01:28:23.280 --> 01:28:23.600]   you know what I mean?
[01:28:23.600 --> 01:28:25.600]   Like this is a behavior that has changed.
[01:28:25.600 --> 01:28:28.000]   I also don't think the in-the-ear thing
[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:28.880]   is all that great.
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:30.720]   You can't wear anything in your ears
[01:28:30.720 --> 01:28:32.080]   for 18 hours a day,
[01:28:32.080 --> 01:28:34.160]   but you can have glasses on for 18 hours a day
[01:28:34.160 --> 01:28:35.680]   and through better bone conduction,
[01:28:35.680 --> 01:28:38.080]   I think that, or maybe a combination,
[01:28:38.080 --> 01:28:39.680]   it can become something that's like,
[01:28:39.680 --> 01:28:40.480]   you get up in the morning,
[01:28:40.480 --> 01:28:42.880]   you put them on and take them off at the end of the day
[01:28:42.880 --> 01:28:43.760]   and they're all day,
[01:28:43.760 --> 01:28:45.280]   the batteries are all day,
[01:28:45.280 --> 01:28:47.040]   the experience is all day, all of it.
[01:28:47.040 --> 01:28:48.800]   - If you have a battery,
[01:28:48.800 --> 01:28:49.760]   if you have a bone conduction--
[01:28:49.760 --> 01:28:50.600]   - If you have a battery,
[01:28:50.600 --> 01:28:51.440]   if you have a bone conduction--
[01:28:51.440 --> 01:28:52.240]   - Go ahead, I'm sorry.
[01:28:52.240 --> 01:28:55.200]   - If you have bone conduction at the end of your lenses
[01:28:55.200 --> 01:28:57.920]   on the arms behind your ears--
[01:28:57.920 --> 01:28:58.880]   - On the temple piece.
[01:28:58.880 --> 01:29:00.960]   - In some fashion, that would work really well.
[01:29:00.960 --> 01:29:02.080]   - Yeah.
[01:29:02.080 --> 01:29:04.560]   - It would sound like somebody's talking to you.
[01:29:04.560 --> 01:29:05.400]   - Yeah.
[01:29:05.400 --> 01:29:06.400]   - That'd freak me out a little bit.
[01:29:06.400 --> 01:29:07.240]   - Yeah.
[01:29:07.240 --> 01:29:09.120]   - You guys remember the amazing moments of Mr. Lincoln
[01:29:09.120 --> 01:29:12.080]   at Disneyland where you put those really thick headphones on
[01:29:12.080 --> 01:29:12.800]   and they would play us,
[01:29:12.800 --> 01:29:14.880]   you were like a Civil War soldier
[01:29:14.880 --> 01:29:16.320]   and then you'd go get a haircut,
[01:29:16.320 --> 01:29:20.160]   you could hear this sound in the way that the audio was mixed.
[01:29:20.160 --> 01:29:22.880]   It sounded like your hair was actually being cut.
[01:29:22.880 --> 01:29:24.320]   It was horrific.
[01:29:24.320 --> 01:29:25.680]   Really amazing.
[01:29:25.680 --> 01:29:26.480]   - It's the future.
[01:29:26.480 --> 01:29:27.920]   - The future is a fake haircut.
[01:29:27.920 --> 01:29:28.800]   - Absolutely terrific.
[01:29:28.800 --> 01:29:29.680]   - It was terrifying.
[01:29:29.680 --> 01:29:31.520]   - It was terrifying.
[01:29:31.520 --> 01:29:33.200]   - I think, actually, I'll be honest with you,
[01:29:33.200 --> 01:29:35.600]   I think Facebook is gonna be the loser in this.
[01:29:35.600 --> 01:29:36.440]   - Yeah.
[01:29:36.440 --> 01:29:37.760]   - I really don't think Facebook is in great.
[01:29:37.760 --> 01:29:40.640]   But Oculus Rift may be their last hope,
[01:29:40.640 --> 01:29:41.520]   but I have a few,
[01:29:41.520 --> 01:29:43.040]   I think the world is turning against--
[01:29:43.040 --> 01:29:44.160]   - They'll get into something else.
[01:29:44.160 --> 01:29:46.240]   - The world is turning, we don't have a lot of money.
[01:29:46.240 --> 01:29:48.520]   - We've got a lot of people turn against social media
[01:29:48.520 --> 01:29:49.360]   in general, I think.
[01:29:49.360 --> 01:29:50.720]   - In general, yeah.
[01:29:50.720 --> 01:29:52.960]   - I think it will be very interesting.
[01:29:52.960 --> 01:29:54.800]   This is a thing that I'm dying to see.
[01:29:54.800 --> 01:29:58.960]   I can't wait to see it when I'm old, is Gen Z.
[01:29:58.960 --> 01:30:01.760]   Or I think why are they calling them the eye generation,
[01:30:01.760 --> 01:30:02.960]   right, like eye generation?
[01:30:02.960 --> 01:30:03.800]   - Yeah, oh.
[01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:05.320]   (laughing)
[01:30:05.320 --> 01:30:08.400]   - I'll just call them Gen Z for intent purposes.
[01:30:08.400 --> 01:30:13.240]   Kids right now, they are social,
[01:30:13.240 --> 01:30:16.360]   but they are not so hyper connected.
[01:30:16.360 --> 01:30:19.440]   They understand, because they've grown up in it,
[01:30:19.440 --> 01:30:21.680]   it's like Bane and Batman.
[01:30:21.680 --> 01:30:23.600]   They are born into it.
[01:30:23.600 --> 01:30:25.440]   And it's not this sort of--
[01:30:25.440 --> 01:30:26.520]   - We're born in.
[01:30:26.520 --> 01:30:30.000]   - There's a really interesting,
[01:30:30.000 --> 01:30:32.840]   like the kids that I know are absolutely,
[01:30:32.840 --> 01:30:34.040]   they love their cell phones.
[01:30:34.040 --> 01:30:36.160]   They are hyper connected kids.
[01:30:36.160 --> 01:30:37.920]   They understand the internet.
[01:30:37.920 --> 01:30:42.120]   Like they are extremely tapped into
[01:30:42.120 --> 01:30:45.200]   the like public consciousness online.
[01:30:45.200 --> 01:30:50.200]   But on that same note, they are very angry at social media.
[01:30:50.200 --> 01:30:52.200]   They're very just kind of like,
[01:30:52.200 --> 01:30:53.480]   ugh, I don't wanna use this.
[01:30:53.480 --> 01:30:55.280]   Like I just wanna talk to my friend.
[01:30:55.280 --> 01:30:56.680]   It's very interesting.
[01:30:56.680 --> 01:30:59.080]   And I would love-- - Generation X was that way too.
[01:30:59.080 --> 01:31:02.960]   - I can't wait to see how they move forward
[01:31:02.960 --> 01:31:06.840]   in the way of shaping what that landscape is in 20 years.
[01:31:06.840 --> 01:31:08.440]   - Facebook thinks it's machine learning
[01:31:08.440 --> 01:31:10.680]   and Facebook thinks it's all the data they're getting
[01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:13.720]   from every different app ecosystem they have,
[01:31:13.720 --> 01:31:16.160]   Instagram, WhatsApp, all these other things.
[01:31:16.160 --> 01:31:19.280]   I mean, that was part of their quarterly results talk
[01:31:19.280 --> 01:31:22.320]   was just talking about all of the data they're picking up
[01:31:22.320 --> 01:31:24.080]   to understand, and they're really obsessed
[01:31:24.080 --> 01:31:25.880]   with meaningful interactions.
[01:31:25.880 --> 01:31:27.320]   They keep saying this publicly.
[01:31:27.320 --> 01:31:29.680]   And what they really mean is they are looking at the data
[01:31:29.680 --> 01:31:31.000]   of people who are burning out.
[01:31:31.000 --> 01:31:32.640]   They're aware of it. - Yes, yes.
[01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:35.480]   - They wound up not being my space for a reason.
[01:31:35.480 --> 01:31:38.680]   That doesn't mean that they are completely faded
[01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:40.200]   to escape that fate.
[01:31:40.200 --> 01:31:45.000]   - Facebook intentionally took a hit as time spent
[01:31:45.000 --> 01:31:47.640]   because they were worried about this very thing.
[01:31:47.640 --> 01:31:48.920]   And they've been saying this-- - Blowback.
[01:31:48.920 --> 01:31:49.760]   - Yeah, blowback.
[01:31:49.760 --> 01:31:50.720]   And they've been saying this.
[01:31:50.720 --> 01:31:53.400]   People who participate actively
[01:31:53.400 --> 01:31:54.880]   have a much more positive experience
[01:31:54.880 --> 01:31:57.800]   than people who passively consume content on Facebook.
[01:31:57.800 --> 01:32:00.720]   I think there's a wild card.
[01:32:00.720 --> 01:32:02.400]   I'm just gonna throw this in and we have to take a break.
[01:32:02.400 --> 01:32:04.640]   But I think there's a wild card here.
[01:32:04.640 --> 01:32:07.680]   And it has to do with this backlash over social.
[01:32:07.680 --> 01:32:10.160]   I think some of the backlash is also about privacy
[01:32:10.160 --> 01:32:11.720]   and it's also about security.
[01:32:11.720 --> 01:32:14.040]   And I think the wild card here is,
[01:32:14.040 --> 01:32:16.840]   and I'm not an Apple booster in general,
[01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:18.640]   but I think the wild card here is,
[01:32:18.640 --> 01:32:22.840]   Apple has an opportunity playing the card security,
[01:32:22.840 --> 01:32:24.880]   playing this card privacy,
[01:32:24.880 --> 01:32:29.240]   stay in our ecosystem, everything works better,
[01:32:29.240 --> 01:32:31.480]   you're secure, we're not spying on you,
[01:32:31.480 --> 01:32:32.600]   we're not an ad.
[01:32:32.600 --> 01:32:37.040]   By the way, the only reason Apple is not in the ad businesses
[01:32:37.040 --> 01:32:38.880]   'cause they tried and failed.
[01:32:38.880 --> 01:32:39.920]   It wasn't-- - Right, right.
[01:32:39.920 --> 01:32:43.000]   - It's not some great magical, oh, we're better.
[01:32:43.000 --> 01:32:44.400]   I mean, they're playing it that way.
[01:32:44.400 --> 01:32:46.320]   But they tried with Apple ads and it was an--
[01:32:46.320 --> 01:32:48.000]   I ads was a massive failure.
[01:32:48.000 --> 01:32:50.400]   - Apple is surprisingly bad at a large number of fans.
[01:32:50.400 --> 01:32:51.960]   - And they're terrible.
[01:32:51.960 --> 01:32:54.200]   But the ecosystem is stronger than all of it.
[01:32:54.200 --> 01:32:57.360]   And I think it's possible, it's a wild card,
[01:32:57.360 --> 01:33:00.200]   that none of this will matter if privacy, security,
[01:33:00.200 --> 01:33:03.440]   and the backlash against social happen,
[01:33:03.440 --> 01:33:08.440]   that people may just go flock to Apple as a safe space.
[01:33:08.440 --> 01:33:09.800]   - Yeah. - You think?
[01:33:09.800 --> 01:33:12.000]   - That's what a lot of people like that with Nintendo.
[01:33:12.000 --> 01:33:17.000]   I mean, the fact that there is not full open voice chat.
[01:33:17.000 --> 01:33:21.240]   It's very curated, it's very tightly knit.
[01:33:21.240 --> 01:33:22.800]   It's not open.
[01:33:22.800 --> 01:33:25.440]   I mean, and a lot of people really like that.
[01:33:25.440 --> 01:33:27.400]   A lot of people prefer that.
[01:33:27.400 --> 01:33:30.160]   And so as opposed to going on, say, PC,
[01:33:30.160 --> 01:33:35.160]   and having to deal with voice chat, which is a nightmare,
[01:33:35.160 --> 01:33:38.240]   it's a terrible nightmare.
[01:33:38.240 --> 01:33:41.280]   But Nintendo is like, no, we're gonna do it
[01:33:41.280 --> 01:33:43.040]   a little bit differently and we wanna keep people's
[01:33:43.040 --> 01:33:45.080]   information private and kind of.
[01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:47.600]   And I think a lot of, especially parents,
[01:33:47.600 --> 01:33:49.260]   that is very appealing to them.
[01:33:50.720 --> 01:33:52.280]   But I do think that, like you said,
[01:33:52.280 --> 01:33:56.080]   there's very much this sort of awareness of kind of,
[01:33:56.080 --> 01:33:58.080]   we're starting to see now these studies come out
[01:33:58.080 --> 01:33:59.800]   about the dangers of social media,
[01:33:59.800 --> 01:34:02.080]   these higher instances of depression and anxiety
[01:34:02.080 --> 01:34:05.400]   because people are watching other people's highlight reels
[01:34:05.400 --> 01:34:09.080]   and comparing them to their own just mundane everyday life.
[01:34:09.080 --> 01:34:11.600]   - Ironically, this was Facebook's own research.
[01:34:11.600 --> 01:34:12.440]   (laughs)
[01:34:12.440 --> 01:34:13.960]   - Yeah, yeah, exactly.
[01:34:13.960 --> 01:34:16.120]   And so I think that at the end of the day,
[01:34:16.120 --> 01:34:20.160]   like that is a very interesting kind of wild card
[01:34:20.160 --> 01:34:22.080]   and it's not unrealistic.
[01:34:22.080 --> 01:34:22.920]   - Yeah.
[01:34:22.920 --> 01:34:24.800]   All right, let's take a little break.
[01:34:24.800 --> 01:34:26.800]   We'll come back with more Sam Mascovitch is here.
[01:34:26.800 --> 01:34:29.520]   He's the culture editor, tech culture editor
[01:34:29.520 --> 01:34:31.400]   in ours, Technica, always a pleasure.
[01:34:31.400 --> 01:34:32.760]   - At Sam Ritter, yep.
[01:34:32.760 --> 01:34:37.440]   - On the Twitter, he's giving up his Super Bowl for us.
[01:34:37.440 --> 01:34:39.920]   - Yep, my Super Bowl, that's it, that is absolutely it.
[01:34:39.920 --> 01:34:43.120]   I am the sports guy, clearly, as you can see,
[01:34:43.120 --> 01:34:46.040]   by all of my sports regalia behind me.
[01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:48.280]   - Is that hello, Kitty, behind you?
[01:34:48.280 --> 01:34:50.760]   - Oh, there's all kind of crap.
[01:34:50.760 --> 01:34:52.360]   You could win, I'll give you a dollar
[01:34:52.360 --> 01:34:53.400]   for every single thing back there
[01:34:53.400 --> 01:34:54.240]   that you can actually record.
[01:34:54.240 --> 01:34:57.240]   I actually have, my most weird thing is a board game
[01:34:57.240 --> 01:35:00.240]   that's still in the shrink wrap called Bedmaster,
[01:35:00.240 --> 01:35:04.520]   which is a very rare, I believe, like 10 of its kind,
[01:35:04.520 --> 01:35:06.600]   that is like a swingers board game that was made
[01:35:06.600 --> 01:35:08.920]   in the 70s that I found for $5.
[01:35:08.920 --> 01:35:09.760]   - Did best.
[01:35:09.760 --> 01:35:11.400]   - Yeah, I've never played it, I swear.
[01:35:11.400 --> 01:35:14.120]   But that is the weirdest thing of all the crap I have.
[01:35:14.120 --> 01:35:17.560]   - Are you sad, Ashley, Isketha, that they're shutting?
[01:35:17.560 --> 01:35:21.200]   - It was the Weebull server, what is it they call?
[01:35:21.200 --> 01:35:24.120]   The little we, are they shutting that down?
[01:35:24.120 --> 01:35:25.800]   - Oh, I don't know, what is it?
[01:35:25.800 --> 01:35:26.680]   - Did they hear the Tomo?
[01:35:26.680 --> 01:35:28.960]   - We Tomo, that's it, terrible.
[01:35:28.960 --> 01:35:31.840]   - Oh, they're shutting out the, yeah, you know, honestly,
[01:35:31.840 --> 01:35:34.880]   like, it was cute for like five minutes.
[01:35:34.880 --> 01:35:38.160]   - Me Tomo, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me, me,
[01:35:38.160 --> 01:35:39.000]   - Me, Tomo.
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:41.960]   - Me, Tomo, cute, super cute, but the thing is,
[01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:44.760]   is like, one, I didn't realize this,
[01:35:44.760 --> 01:35:49.200]   but if you connect your Me Tomo to your Nintendo account
[01:35:49.200 --> 01:35:51.880]   and then you get a Nintendo Switch,
[01:35:51.880 --> 01:35:53.960]   it actually recommends you as a friend
[01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:56.880]   to like everyone you've ever friended in Me Tomo.
[01:35:56.880 --> 01:35:58.880]   So a whole bunch of people that I didn't know
[01:35:58.880 --> 01:36:00.760]   that I randomly friended in Me Tomo
[01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:03.000]   were asking me to friend them on Nintendo Switch
[01:36:03.000 --> 01:36:05.080]   and I felt really bad because I had declined the walk.
[01:36:05.080 --> 01:36:06.720]   So I'm like, I don't know you, and I don't know you.
[01:36:06.720 --> 01:36:09.560]   That's weird, like I'm very like kind of private
[01:36:09.560 --> 01:36:12.320]   about my gamer tags and handles and all that stuff.
[01:36:12.320 --> 01:36:14.760]   And so, you know, cool idea.
[01:36:14.760 --> 01:36:17.320]   And also I wish the technology for the Me's,
[01:36:17.320 --> 01:36:18.640]   the way they're designed and everything
[01:36:18.640 --> 01:36:21.200]   would make its way over to Nintendo Switch
[01:36:21.200 --> 01:36:24.360]   because it's still really boring and primitive
[01:36:24.360 --> 01:36:26.520]   and you actually had some options for like fashion
[01:36:26.520 --> 01:36:28.760]   and hairstyles and accessories.
[01:36:28.760 --> 01:36:30.880]   - They're killing this, aren't they?
[01:36:30.880 --> 01:36:31.720]   - Or not, is it?
[01:36:31.720 --> 01:36:32.560]   - I know they're killing it.
[01:36:32.560 --> 01:36:34.080]   I hope they take the technology
[01:36:34.080 --> 01:36:39.080]   and put it into the Me creation tool on the Switch.
[01:36:39.080 --> 01:36:41.120]   That's what I'm hoping for.
[01:36:41.120 --> 01:36:41.960]   - Especially as it's CNET.
[01:36:41.960 --> 01:36:44.480]   - But, rest in peace, Me Tomo, we hardly knew you.
[01:36:44.480 --> 01:36:46.640]   - Watch her tomorrow in a brand new show,
[01:36:46.640 --> 01:36:49.080]   a brand new part of the road show or something.
[01:36:49.080 --> 01:36:52.840]   We don't know, find out tomorrow morning on CNET.com.
[01:36:52.840 --> 01:36:55.280]   And Mike Elgin, Fast Company,
[01:36:55.280 --> 01:36:59.880]   ComputerWorldElgin.com, he is our digital nomad.
[01:36:59.880 --> 01:37:02.480]   - That's right, and quick plug,
[01:37:02.480 --> 01:37:04.600]   the Prosecco experience in the Prosecco Hills
[01:37:04.600 --> 01:37:07.280]   region of Italy, literally paradise on earth.
[01:37:07.280 --> 01:37:09.400]   We gotta room for two more people and one more couple.
[01:37:09.400 --> 01:37:10.240]   - Gastronomad.
[01:37:10.240 --> 01:37:13.080]   - We'd love that to be somebody from the Twitter army.
[01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:15.160]   So check it out, gastronomad.net.
[01:37:15.160 --> 01:37:16.360]   - So would I.
[01:37:16.360 --> 01:37:17.200]   - Yeah.
[01:37:17.200 --> 01:37:18.020]   - When is that trick?
[01:37:18.020 --> 01:37:18.840]   What is it, what's happening?
[01:37:18.840 --> 01:37:20.320]   - Maybe it could be Ashley Esquetha.
[01:37:20.320 --> 01:37:21.160]   - That is in--
[01:37:21.160 --> 01:37:22.760]   - Well, my best friend is getting married
[01:37:22.760 --> 01:37:24.240]   in Italy in October.
[01:37:24.240 --> 01:37:25.080]   - This is in May.
[01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:26.360]   - Ah, yeah, this is in May.
[01:37:26.360 --> 01:37:28.960]   - So I'm gonna keep an eye on your experiences though,
[01:37:28.960 --> 01:37:30.600]   'cause that seems like maybe something
[01:37:30.600 --> 01:37:33.600]   that I could take advantage of.
[01:37:33.600 --> 01:37:34.920]   - Totally, totally.
[01:37:34.920 --> 01:37:37.000]   - You've got a whole schedule now, you've really,
[01:37:37.000 --> 01:37:39.880]   I think we're gonna do the Morocco experience in 2019.
[01:37:39.880 --> 01:37:40.720]   - That's the one we're in.
[01:37:40.720 --> 01:37:41.560]   - That's gonna be amazing.
[01:37:41.560 --> 01:37:42.920]   - I'm really raming at that one.
[01:37:42.920 --> 01:37:44.680]   And Prosecco next year as well.
[01:37:44.680 --> 01:37:46.800]   - We're doing two Proseccos, but the one coming up.
[01:37:46.800 --> 01:37:48.760]   - Last chance, almost full.
[01:37:48.760 --> 01:37:50.440]   - Yeah, it's gonna be great.
[01:37:50.440 --> 01:37:51.280]   - They cook.
[01:37:51.280 --> 01:37:52.120]   - Mike, can you do me a favor?
[01:37:52.120 --> 01:37:52.960]   - Yes.
[01:37:52.960 --> 01:37:57.800]   - In 2020, do a Tokyo experience where we go to
[01:37:57.800 --> 01:38:00.440]   the Olympic games, we go to the opening ceremony
[01:38:00.440 --> 01:38:04.040]   of the Olympic games and then we go to Mario Nintendo World
[01:38:04.040 --> 01:38:05.440]   at Universal Studios.
[01:38:05.440 --> 01:38:06.360]   That's what I want.
[01:38:06.360 --> 01:38:07.200]   - We're going in--
[01:38:07.200 --> 01:38:08.320]   - Anything for you Ashley.
[01:38:08.320 --> 01:38:10.360]   - In the spring, in a couple months Ashley,
[01:38:10.360 --> 01:38:12.520]   we're going to Osaka and Tokyo and I wanna--
[01:38:12.520 --> 01:38:13.920]   - Did they give you the mustache?
[01:38:13.920 --> 01:38:17.240]   - I wanna do the Mario cart where you drive around the tour.
[01:38:17.240 --> 01:38:19.920]   They put you suit on that you look like Mario
[01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:20.760]   or waiting for it.
[01:38:20.760 --> 01:38:22.880]   Cannot wait to throw bananas at moving cars.
[01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:23.720]   It's gonna be awesome.
[01:38:23.720 --> 01:38:25.080]   - Drive a little go-cart.
[01:38:25.080 --> 01:38:28.480]   It's a Mario cart tour of Osaka or Tokyo.
[01:38:28.480 --> 01:38:29.320]   We're doing it.
[01:38:29.320 --> 01:38:31.880]   - That sounds literally like one of the best things
[01:38:31.880 --> 01:38:33.880]   I've ever been. - I'm sure that it's totally safe,
[01:38:33.880 --> 01:38:35.960]   but if anybody were killed, what an oat.
[01:38:35.960 --> 01:38:37.400]   - What an oat, he died.
[01:38:37.400 --> 01:38:38.240]   - As of death, though.
[01:38:38.240 --> 01:38:39.080]   - As his hero.
[01:38:39.080 --> 01:38:40.440]   - He died as he lived, playing Mario cart.
[01:38:40.440 --> 01:38:41.280]   - Playing Mario cart.
[01:38:41.280 --> 01:38:42.680]   - That blue shell, man.
[01:38:42.680 --> 01:38:43.680]   (laughing)
[01:38:43.680 --> 01:38:44.520]   - Gets you every time.
[01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:46.520]   Make sure you carry a horn with you.
[01:38:46.520 --> 01:38:47.800]   And you gotta get that horn.
[01:38:47.800 --> 01:38:49.280]   You can crack blue shells.
[01:38:49.280 --> 01:38:51.840]   (laughing)
[01:38:51.840 --> 01:38:52.680]   - I showed you that.
[01:38:52.680 --> 01:38:54.960]   Do you notice that the air quality in the studio is better?
[01:38:54.960 --> 01:38:55.800]   You probably don't.
[01:38:55.800 --> 01:38:58.040]   No, it is.
[01:38:58.040 --> 01:38:59.160]   It's nice, I can tell.
[01:38:59.160 --> 01:39:02.120]   We had to do this because there was the fires
[01:39:02.120 --> 01:39:03.800]   and everything was smoky and then they were tiring
[01:39:03.800 --> 01:39:04.720]   the roof and it was horrible.
[01:39:04.720 --> 01:39:06.240]   You don't, oh, Taurus it was worse.
[01:39:06.240 --> 01:39:07.600]   And then they were painting.
[01:39:07.600 --> 01:39:09.400]   And so we got this molecule thing.
[01:39:09.400 --> 01:39:10.760]   I have one at home.
[01:39:10.760 --> 01:39:12.320]   I have one in the studio.
[01:39:12.320 --> 01:39:13.160]   Michael has one.
[01:39:13.160 --> 01:39:14.720]   Go ahead, you can bring me the molecule.
[01:39:14.720 --> 01:39:17.800]   The air quality will slowly decrease in quality.
[01:39:17.800 --> 01:39:20.200]   - It looks like a giant echo, doesn't it?
[01:39:20.200 --> 01:39:21.040]   - It does.
[01:39:21.040 --> 01:39:21.880]   You almost can talk to it.
[01:39:21.880 --> 01:39:23.240]   You can pair it to your phone.
[01:39:23.240 --> 01:39:25.320]   So the idea though, this is not a HEPA filter.
[01:39:25.320 --> 01:39:28.200]   That is 1940s, literally technology
[01:39:28.200 --> 01:39:32.000]   that just tries to filter out stuff in the air.
[01:39:32.000 --> 01:39:34.440]   There has not been really an air filtration,
[01:39:34.440 --> 01:39:35.960]   much improvement since the HEPA filter.
[01:39:35.960 --> 01:39:37.600]   There's still still people touting that.
[01:39:37.600 --> 01:39:41.440]   This is Pico technology, PECO photo,
[01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:44.120]   electrochemical oxidation.
[01:39:44.120 --> 01:39:46.080]   It goes well beyond a HEPA filter.
[01:39:46.080 --> 01:39:48.280]   Captures and eliminates allergens,
[01:39:48.280 --> 01:39:50.440]   mold bacteria.
[01:39:50.440 --> 01:39:51.520]   See, bacteria is so small,
[01:39:51.520 --> 01:39:53.080]   it goes right through a HEPA filter.
[01:39:53.080 --> 01:39:55.800]   Viruses, even airborne chemicals.
[01:39:55.800 --> 01:39:59.120]   I'm talking about pollutants 1000 times smaller
[01:39:59.120 --> 01:40:03.280]   than anything a HEPA filter can catch.
[01:40:03.280 --> 01:40:05.520]   And I have to say, Lisa used to get headaches.
[01:40:05.520 --> 01:40:07.160]   She started suffering from allergies.
[01:40:07.160 --> 01:40:08.920]   We live out in the country with grasses and molds.
[01:40:08.920 --> 01:40:10.720]   And she was getting headaches every night.
[01:40:10.720 --> 01:40:12.560]   We put the molecule in the bedroom
[01:40:12.560 --> 01:40:14.840]   and I haven't had headaches since, she says.
[01:40:14.840 --> 01:40:16.440]   - You know, Leo, I'm starting to rub,
[01:40:16.440 --> 01:40:19.000]   but out here in agricultural area,
[01:40:19.000 --> 01:40:20.840]   there's a lot of weird stuff that I don't know.
[01:40:20.840 --> 01:40:21.680]   - It's bad, I don't know.
[01:40:21.680 --> 01:40:22.520]   - You need this actually.
[01:40:22.520 --> 01:40:23.360]   - Absolutely.
[01:40:23.360 --> 01:40:25.360]   - You get all sorts of stuff in the air.
[01:40:25.360 --> 01:40:27.560]   But it's also great for offices.
[01:40:27.560 --> 01:40:30.120]   The sick office syndrome where you can't open windows.
[01:40:30.120 --> 01:40:31.440]   You put this in there.
[01:40:31.440 --> 01:40:33.640]   The technology in this is high tech.
[01:40:33.640 --> 01:40:37.560]   It was funded by the EPA, extensively tested by real people.
[01:40:37.560 --> 01:40:41.200]   It's been tested and verified by university laboratories
[01:40:41.200 --> 01:40:42.720]   at the University of South Florida Center
[01:40:42.720 --> 01:40:44.920]   for Biological Defense.
[01:40:44.920 --> 01:40:47.960]   The University of Minnesota's particle collaboration,
[01:40:47.960 --> 01:40:49.400]   a laboratory.
[01:40:49.400 --> 01:40:50.880]   It's really easy to use.
[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:53.160]   You pair it with your phone, you pair it with your Wi-Fi.
[01:40:53.160 --> 01:40:55.960]   You don't have to, it has controls on the top.
[01:40:55.960 --> 01:40:56.960]   But if you pair it with your phone
[01:40:56.960 --> 01:40:58.440]   that has this great advantage,
[01:40:58.440 --> 01:41:00.040]   it will send you new filters when you need them.
[01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:01.680]   We've been using for six months,
[01:41:01.680 --> 01:41:02.840]   we just got our new filter.
[01:41:02.840 --> 01:41:05.760]   There's two filters, including that Pico filter,
[01:41:05.760 --> 01:41:10.760]   which is actually a catalyst.
[01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:13.960]   So it traps the molecules.
[01:41:13.960 --> 01:41:18.960]   And then this light burns, it's hard to describe.
[01:41:18.960 --> 01:41:20.760]   Go read the website.
[01:41:20.760 --> 01:41:21.720]   It's beautifully designed.
[01:41:21.720 --> 01:41:23.200]   They call it the apple of air filters.
[01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:24.320]   And here's some good news.
[01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:26.080]   They just got a whole bunch more in there.
[01:41:26.080 --> 01:41:28.920]   They've been selling so fast that they've been running out.
[01:41:28.920 --> 01:41:30.680]   Now the whole new shipment came in.
[01:41:30.680 --> 01:41:32.720]   So it's a good chance to get molecule.
[01:41:32.720 --> 01:41:34.880]   You can connect it, control it to your Wi-Fi,
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:36.240]   control it remotely from your smartphone.
[01:41:36.240 --> 01:41:38.560]   I could turn it on and off from here.
[01:41:38.560 --> 01:41:40.960]   I just truthfully, we just leave it on in silent mode.
[01:41:40.960 --> 01:41:43.880]   And we have the light turn off at night
[01:41:43.880 --> 01:41:45.440]   so it doesn't bother us at night.
[01:41:45.440 --> 01:41:46.880]   But when it comes on, it burns off
[01:41:46.880 --> 01:41:49.120]   while everything collected over the night.
[01:41:49.120 --> 01:41:50.440]   You don't have to use the Bluetooth
[01:41:50.440 --> 01:41:51.560]   or Wi-Fi capabilities.
[01:41:51.560 --> 01:41:53.600]   It's got a button on the top.
[01:41:53.600 --> 01:41:55.720]   You're gonna save 75 bucks off your first order.
[01:41:55.720 --> 01:41:57.880]   I really love this product.
[01:41:57.880 --> 01:42:01.880]   Molecule, M-O-L-E, K-U-L-E.com.
[01:42:01.880 --> 01:42:04.240]   Enter the promo code TWIT.
[01:42:04.240 --> 01:42:07.080]   If you've had asthma, allergies, breathing problems,
[01:42:07.080 --> 01:42:08.920]   if you're concerned about mold,
[01:42:08.920 --> 01:42:11.720]   any kind of VOCs, you know, paint in the air,
[01:42:11.720 --> 01:42:14.720]   smoke in the air, this you gotta get.
[01:42:14.720 --> 01:42:18.600]   It's the, I poo-pooed all of these ionizers
[01:42:18.600 --> 01:42:19.720]   and HEPA filters for years.
[01:42:19.720 --> 01:42:21.560]   I've tried them, never did anything.
[01:42:21.560 --> 01:42:23.760]   This one actually does a lot.
[01:42:23.760 --> 01:42:26.640]   M-O-L-E, K-U-L-E.com.
[01:42:26.640 --> 01:42:30.560]   Promocode TWIT for the Molecule.
[01:42:30.560 --> 01:42:32.720]   And I know it's a little pricey at $7.99,
[01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:36.880]   but I gotta tell you, and you do get $75 off
[01:42:36.880 --> 01:42:38.200]   if you use our TWIT offer code,
[01:42:38.200 --> 01:42:40.280]   but I gotta tell you, it is worth every penny.
[01:42:40.280 --> 01:42:41.600]   We bought another one for here.
[01:42:41.600 --> 01:42:43.880]   We bought another one for Michael, for his room.
[01:42:43.880 --> 01:42:45.120]   It just really works.
[01:42:45.120 --> 01:42:48.320]   Back to the show, we had a great week.
[01:42:48.320 --> 01:42:50.000]   Actually, you know what I wanna show you real quickly?
[01:42:50.000 --> 01:42:51.440]   The highlight reel.
[01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:53.520]   This is what happened on TWIT this week.
[01:42:53.520 --> 01:42:56.960]   Previously on TWIT.
[01:42:56.960 --> 01:42:58.040]   Does it sit stand us?
[01:42:58.040 --> 01:43:00.640]   This allows you to raise and lower this.
[01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:02.040]   So topy.
[01:43:02.040 --> 01:43:03.480]   To where you needed to be.
[01:43:03.480 --> 01:43:06.680]   Probably not designed for people quite as tall as you.
[01:43:06.680 --> 01:43:08.960]   IOS today.
[01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:12.720]   It's time for the first episode of Subscription Survivor.
[01:43:12.720 --> 01:43:13.680]   Boom, boom, boom, boom.
[01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:15.680]   You start looking at like your credit card
[01:43:15.680 --> 01:43:16.520]   or your bank statements
[01:43:16.520 --> 01:43:20.080]   and all these little five dollar charges,
[01:43:20.080 --> 01:43:22.360]   they'd like nimble away at you.
[01:43:22.360 --> 01:43:24.000]   Just by a thousand subscriptions.
[01:43:24.000 --> 01:43:25.000]   Yes.
[01:43:25.000 --> 01:43:26.400]   Exactly.
[01:43:26.400 --> 01:43:27.880]   So today we're gonna talk about that
[01:43:27.880 --> 01:43:29.240]   and how to fix it.
[01:43:29.240 --> 01:43:30.760]   The new screen savers.
[01:43:30.760 --> 01:43:33.760]   You can see the ruins under the trees
[01:43:33.760 --> 01:43:35.080]   in the Guatemalan forest.
[01:43:35.080 --> 01:43:37.480]   Archaeologist Thomas Garrison,
[01:43:37.480 --> 01:43:39.240]   a National Geographic Explorer
[01:43:39.240 --> 01:43:42.600]   and his team used LIDAR to scan the forest.
[01:43:42.600 --> 01:43:46.360]   We spent about eight years of our field seasons
[01:43:46.360 --> 01:43:49.720]   trying to do a really detailed map of that city.
[01:43:49.720 --> 01:43:53.280]   That probably cost us over $100,000
[01:43:53.280 --> 01:43:55.120]   over the time that we did it.
[01:43:55.120 --> 01:43:57.560]   And LIDAR, you know, won flight
[01:43:57.560 --> 01:43:59.440]   and you get so much more than that.
[01:43:59.440 --> 01:44:01.480]   One day and it does it better than we do.
[01:44:01.480 --> 01:44:03.680]   To it coming to you for 38 degrees,
[01:44:03.680 --> 01:44:07.360]   14 minutes north, 122 degrees, 38 minutes west.
[01:44:07.360 --> 01:44:08.200]   Really?
[01:44:08.200 --> 01:44:09.560]   That's where we are.
[01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:11.120]   By the way, that LIDAR is so cool.
[01:44:11.120 --> 01:44:13.600]   There's gonna be a National Geographic special on the sixth
[01:44:13.600 --> 01:44:17.160]   is that's day after tomorrow about that.
[01:44:17.160 --> 01:44:19.600]   That they map the Guatemala rainforest
[01:44:19.600 --> 01:44:21.240]   and they found all these new ruins.
[01:44:21.240 --> 01:44:22.080]   So cool.
[01:44:22.080 --> 01:44:24.680]   I'm a huge fan of the Mayan world and that culture.
[01:44:24.680 --> 01:44:26.960]   And I bend to those places and it tickles,
[01:44:26.960 --> 01:44:28.880]   especially which is where one of those is.
[01:44:28.880 --> 01:44:30.880]   You can go on one of these pyramids that pokes out of the top
[01:44:30.880 --> 01:44:32.560]   and you look out and it's just, you see forest.
[01:44:32.560 --> 01:44:33.760]   You can't tell what's there.
[01:44:33.760 --> 01:44:37.320]   And they actually have realized that there's millions more
[01:44:37.320 --> 01:44:40.280]   people who lived in that world than they thought.
[01:44:40.280 --> 01:44:43.720]   And it includes, they found these raised roads.
[01:44:43.720 --> 01:44:44.880]   Yeah, they're seeing roads.
[01:44:44.880 --> 01:44:45.720]   Yes.
[01:44:45.720 --> 01:44:46.560]   City of the city.
[01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:47.400]   It's amazing.
[01:44:47.400 --> 01:44:48.240]   Incredible.
[01:44:48.240 --> 01:44:50.080]   This is the biggest archaeological news in a decade.
[01:44:50.080 --> 01:44:50.920]   It was really, wow.
[01:44:50.920 --> 01:44:51.760]   I think so.
[01:44:51.760 --> 01:44:52.760]   Wow, I think it's huge.
[01:44:52.760 --> 01:44:56.320]   Well, I'll be watching that on Tuesday, the National Geographic.
[01:44:56.320 --> 01:44:58.040]   Amazon print money.
[01:44:58.040 --> 01:45:00.280]   Bezos really was he stunned?
[01:45:00.280 --> 01:45:01.000]   Was he stunned?
[01:45:01.000 --> 01:45:02.200]   Miss Amashkovich.
[01:45:02.200 --> 01:45:07.800]   I, the thing about this quarterly release that was an interesting
[01:45:07.800 --> 01:45:11.400]   takeaway was that Amazon had predicted an operating income
[01:45:11.400 --> 01:45:13.280]   of a certain amount of up to--
[01:45:13.280 --> 01:45:15.600]   I can't remember the exact number-- but they exceeded
[01:45:15.600 --> 01:45:17.960]   their own estimate for how much money they were going
[01:45:17.960 --> 01:45:20.680]   to make this past quarter by 69%.
[01:45:20.680 --> 01:45:22.960]   Their top end estimate, they exceeded.
[01:45:22.960 --> 01:45:25.440]   And they don't say exactly why, except there's one quote
[01:45:25.440 --> 01:45:28.760]   from Bezos saying, yeah, our Echo devices are doing well.
[01:45:28.760 --> 01:45:32.680]   And when you look at the number, the way that they describe
[01:45:32.680 --> 01:45:35.880]   all the stuff, there's so many little bullet points in the
[01:45:35.880 --> 01:45:36.400]   release.
[01:45:36.400 --> 01:45:39.240]   But the big one, there were two that I noticed, was one that
[01:45:39.240 --> 01:45:42.200]   Echo sold tens of millions of units in the past year.
[01:45:42.200 --> 01:45:45.800]   And then they pointed out that their kindles took 11 years
[01:45:45.800 --> 01:45:47.520]   to sell quote unquote tens of millions.
[01:45:47.520 --> 01:45:48.000]   Wow.
[01:45:48.000 --> 01:45:51.680]   So it sounds like they're not saying exactly, but that in
[01:45:51.680 --> 01:45:55.120]   about a year that the Echo line is essentially getting to
[01:45:55.120 --> 01:45:58.680]   that Kindle level of saturation, which is insane.
[01:45:58.680 --> 01:46:00.560]   And I think the dot is the real driver.
[01:46:00.560 --> 01:46:02.480]   They essentially said, it's 30 bucks.
[01:46:02.480 --> 01:46:04.040]   The speaker is good enough.
[01:46:04.040 --> 01:46:04.920]   That's what the review said.
[01:46:04.920 --> 01:46:07.000]   And that's what I found is the speaker is good enough.
[01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:09.040]   You can plug it into one of your spare ones and a pinch if
[01:46:09.040 --> 01:46:10.120]   you want to listen to music.
[01:46:10.120 --> 01:46:12.880]   But if you just want to dip your toe in, so there's that
[01:46:12.880 --> 01:46:13.520]   half of it.
[01:46:13.520 --> 01:46:15.360]   And everybody is creating skills.
[01:46:15.360 --> 01:46:17.880]   There are so many companies that are making these skills
[01:46:17.880 --> 01:46:19.680]   that are so easy to get running.
[01:46:19.680 --> 01:46:22.720]   You can just say a phrase that your Echo doesn't support.
[01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:26.240]   And it'll search for that skill, install it for you, and
[01:46:26.240 --> 01:46:27.720]   tell you about it on your app.
[01:46:27.720 --> 01:46:29.920]   And people are really embracing this, whether you're
[01:46:29.920 --> 01:46:32.560]   playing Jeopardy on the thing or playing with some of these
[01:46:32.560 --> 01:46:36.800]   games or weird radio show things or using company specific
[01:46:36.800 --> 01:46:38.920]   Alexa voice skills, it's happening.
[01:46:38.920 --> 01:46:40.040]   And that really matters.
[01:46:40.040 --> 01:46:40.680]   And I'm really sorry.
[01:46:40.680 --> 01:46:42.920]   I actually just turned my own device on by breaking our rule.
[01:46:42.920 --> 01:46:44.160]   Sorry about that.
[01:46:44.160 --> 01:46:46.120]   Call it Echo.
[01:46:46.120 --> 01:46:48.920]   The other, the other billion dollars that they didn't note
[01:46:48.920 --> 01:46:52.000]   was children accidentally ordering stuff.
[01:46:52.000 --> 01:46:53.200]   Don't ask.
[01:46:53.200 --> 01:46:55.600]   So it's just a billion dollars of revenue there.
[01:46:55.600 --> 01:46:56.880]   Little tiny electric cars.
[01:46:56.880 --> 01:47:00.240]   So there's no question that the Echo is super successful.
[01:47:00.240 --> 01:47:02.360]   And I thought this was pretty obvious that this was going
[01:47:02.360 --> 01:47:02.880]   to happen years ago.
[01:47:02.880 --> 01:47:04.280]   And I saw right columns three years ago.
[01:47:04.280 --> 01:47:06.960]   And oh, this is going to be a problem for Apple.
[01:47:06.960 --> 01:47:08.640]   This is going to be clobber everybody.
[01:47:08.640 --> 01:47:10.480]   And a lot of people were kind of like, oh, you're crazy.
[01:47:10.480 --> 01:47:12.400]   But no, this is clearly a great play.
[01:47:12.400 --> 01:47:13.640]   They're succeeding wildly.
[01:47:13.640 --> 01:47:16.680]   But it always bothers me this Amazon thing that they do,
[01:47:16.680 --> 01:47:18.920]   where they say, oh, we're wildly successful.
[01:47:18.920 --> 01:47:19.480]   Well, how many?
[01:47:19.480 --> 01:47:20.480]   We're not going to tell you.
[01:47:20.480 --> 01:47:22.440]   But trust us, we're hugely successful.
[01:47:22.440 --> 01:47:23.400]   We're selling so many.
[01:47:23.400 --> 01:47:24.120]   How many?
[01:47:24.120 --> 01:47:25.200]   Well, we're not going to say.
[01:47:25.200 --> 01:47:26.160]   They do this with kindles.
[01:47:26.160 --> 01:47:28.400]   They do this with all the stuff that they sell.
[01:47:28.400 --> 01:47:33.680]   They come out with these dumb things like, oh, the kindles
[01:47:33.680 --> 01:47:36.120]   sold better on Amazon than any other tablet.
[01:47:36.120 --> 01:47:37.120]   Well, what does that mean?
[01:47:37.120 --> 01:47:37.440]   Yeah.
[01:47:37.440 --> 01:47:38.160]   It's number one.
[01:47:38.160 --> 01:47:40.800]   They always kind of spin in this sense of success.
[01:47:40.800 --> 01:47:43.560]   But they don't, you know, they don't pony up and say,
[01:47:43.560 --> 01:47:44.920]   what's the actual number?
[01:47:44.920 --> 01:47:45.600]   I never say it.
[01:47:45.600 --> 01:47:46.360]   It bugs me.
[01:47:46.360 --> 01:47:48.680]   Do you think, Mike, though, this is like a trend that's
[01:47:48.680 --> 01:47:51.000]   happening because we see this with Netflix?
[01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:53.360]   Like they don't actually give numbers anymore.
[01:47:53.360 --> 01:47:57.000]   Like there's these companies are kind of moving into that space.
[01:47:57.000 --> 01:48:01.040]   Like you said, where it's sort of a very hard spin
[01:48:01.040 --> 01:48:05.720]   to make their product look number one in some respect, you
[01:48:05.720 --> 01:48:07.800]   know, and it's like--
[01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:08.800]   The problem?
[01:48:08.800 --> 01:48:10.680]   I think that is maybe not--
[01:48:10.680 --> 01:48:11.440]   I don't love it.
[01:48:11.440 --> 01:48:12.000]   I hate it.
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:13.040]   I think it's the worst.
[01:48:13.040 --> 01:48:14.560]   The problem is that it's us, though.
[01:48:14.560 --> 01:48:15.600]   It's the tech press.
[01:48:15.600 --> 01:48:16.640]   We're so compliant.
[01:48:16.640 --> 01:48:17.080]   We care.
[01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:17.560]   No one else cares.
[01:48:17.560 --> 01:48:18.080]   We want number.
[01:48:18.080 --> 01:48:20.560]   And we just regurgitate everything they say.
[01:48:20.560 --> 01:48:22.880]   And we just say, oh, they're so successful.
[01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:24.200]   And we should be holding them in an account.
[01:48:24.200 --> 01:48:25.120]   This is politics.
[01:48:25.120 --> 01:48:25.960]   We'd be doing that.
[01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:30.040]   We should be holding them to account and say, how many exactly?
[01:48:30.040 --> 01:48:32.640]   This is the big shift from brick and mortar
[01:48:32.640 --> 01:48:34.800]   to online sales, is that with brick and mortar,
[01:48:34.800 --> 01:48:37.480]   there were so many other traditional firms that
[01:48:37.480 --> 01:48:40.040]   tracked sales and estimates.
[01:48:40.040 --> 01:48:42.760]   And that goes away when everything shifts to just have
[01:48:42.760 --> 01:48:45.480]   delivered to your door and have the man unlock your door
[01:48:45.480 --> 01:48:47.560]   with the device that the company sells you
[01:48:47.560 --> 01:48:48.720]   and all this insanity.
[01:48:48.720 --> 01:48:50.640]   So that's absolutely in their favor.
[01:48:50.640 --> 01:48:52.720]   Why give us the data if they don't have to?
[01:48:52.720 --> 01:48:56.000]   Those numbers are used in order to talk to companies
[01:48:56.000 --> 01:48:58.720]   and say, this is why you should come to our platform.
[01:48:58.720 --> 01:49:01.520]   That's considered proprietary sales information.
[01:49:01.520 --> 01:49:04.680]   This is all confidential because that data is used.
[01:49:04.680 --> 01:49:05.240]   So if I don't--
[01:49:05.240 --> 01:49:06.480]   Do compare this, though, to Apple.
[01:49:06.480 --> 01:49:12.280]   So Apple's profit this quarter was $20 billion.
[01:49:12.280 --> 01:49:14.480]   Everybody's all excited because fourth quarter profits
[01:49:14.480 --> 01:49:17.080]   for Amazon were $1.9 billion.
[01:49:17.080 --> 01:49:20.040]   $1/10 this much.
[01:49:20.040 --> 01:49:23.360]   But at the same time, it's like, how many quarters now
[01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:26.120]   that if they had profit, they really kind of started
[01:49:26.120 --> 01:49:29.400]   admitting that they can make money, which is something I think
[01:49:29.400 --> 01:49:30.120]   they avoid.
[01:49:30.120 --> 01:49:31.480]   Jeff Bezos avoided for quite some time.
[01:49:31.480 --> 01:49:33.840]   They avoided until Wall Street got so fed up with it
[01:49:33.840 --> 01:49:35.440]   that now they're making a little--
[01:49:35.440 --> 01:49:37.160]   He controls this totally.
[01:49:37.160 --> 01:49:37.660]   Totally.
[01:49:37.660 --> 01:49:38.160]   Totally.
[01:49:38.160 --> 01:49:40.680]   The minimum amount of information they can get away with.
[01:49:40.680 --> 01:49:41.600]   Yeah.
[01:49:41.600 --> 01:49:45.280]   Meanwhile, Jeff Bezos personally is by far the richest person
[01:49:45.280 --> 01:49:45.960]   who ever lived.
[01:49:45.960 --> 01:49:51.360]   I think the latest number I saw was $123.5 billion
[01:49:51.360 --> 01:49:52.280]   or something like that.
[01:49:52.280 --> 01:49:53.440]   Over $100 billion.
[01:49:53.440 --> 01:49:55.360]   Anything over $100 billion doesn't really.
[01:49:55.360 --> 01:49:55.760]   Who's counting?
[01:49:55.760 --> 01:49:57.440]   He's ridiculously rich.
[01:49:57.440 --> 01:50:00.240]   Kim, one other billionaire could eradicate all poverty
[01:50:00.240 --> 01:50:01.640]   in the United States.
[01:50:01.640 --> 01:50:04.280]   Well, instead, he's building weird things in downtown Seattle,
[01:50:04.280 --> 01:50:07.000]   like the spheres, which we call Bezos's--
[01:50:07.000 --> 01:50:08.040]   starts with a B. Rhine's with Paul.
[01:50:08.040 --> 01:50:10.040]   Oh, my God.
[01:50:10.040 --> 01:50:11.240]   Hey, biosphere.
[01:50:11.240 --> 01:50:14.800]   You went to the Amazon Ghost Store, right, Sam?
[01:50:14.800 --> 01:50:15.280]   I did.
[01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:16.800]   I've been a few times now.
[01:50:16.800 --> 01:50:18.160]   I keep trying to steal from it.
[01:50:18.160 --> 01:50:19.200]   And I fail to it.
[01:50:19.200 --> 01:50:22.680]   I keep accurately charging me every time I go in and take
[01:50:22.680 --> 01:50:23.840]   things and walk out.
[01:50:23.840 --> 01:50:26.160]   So you really can't-- there's no shoplifting in a store
[01:50:26.160 --> 01:50:27.000]   like that.
[01:50:27.000 --> 01:50:29.600]   I'm curious how it works, because now that I've
[01:50:29.600 --> 01:50:32.880]   been a few times and have tested and played around,
[01:50:32.880 --> 01:50:34.160]   I know there's cameras everywhere.
[01:50:34.160 --> 01:50:36.840]   There's more cameras in the store than the maximum number
[01:50:36.840 --> 01:50:38.640]   people allowed as per the fire marshals.
[01:50:38.640 --> 01:50:39.520]   So it's over $100.
[01:50:39.520 --> 01:50:41.800]   And it's a max of 90 as per the fire marshal.
[01:50:41.800 --> 01:50:43.200]   So there's that.
[01:50:43.200 --> 01:50:46.280]   And they all look like a little 2 and 1/2 inch hard drives
[01:50:46.280 --> 01:50:49.360]   with little tiny green dots that are where the sensors are.
[01:50:49.360 --> 01:50:51.880]   And all the shelves are designed in such a way
[01:50:51.880 --> 01:50:54.440]   that certain products can only fit in certain spots.
[01:50:54.440 --> 01:50:57.120]   There's people watching all the inventory, et cetera, et cetera.
[01:50:57.120 --> 01:51:00.080]   Now, the last time I went, I did a couple of weird things.
[01:51:00.080 --> 01:51:02.320]   I did a wardrobe change in the middle of the store.
[01:51:02.320 --> 01:51:04.440]   So the outfit I walked in wearing
[01:51:04.440 --> 01:51:05.760]   was different than what I walked out.
[01:51:05.760 --> 01:51:06.640]   Oh, so clever.
[01:51:06.640 --> 01:51:07.560]   Things like that.
[01:51:07.560 --> 01:51:10.240]   I also at one point grabbed some items that were stuck together
[01:51:10.240 --> 01:51:12.200]   and pulled them out in such a way that it looked like I only
[01:51:12.200 --> 01:51:13.600]   took one of them.
[01:51:13.600 --> 01:51:17.560]   It took an hour and 20 minutes to be charged for that shopping
[01:51:17.560 --> 01:51:17.880]   trip.
[01:51:17.880 --> 01:51:19.520]   Normally, it takes about 10 minutes.
[01:51:19.520 --> 01:51:23.120]   I wonder how much they're doing to manually check
[01:51:23.120 --> 01:51:24.640]   when things seem a little fishy.
[01:51:24.640 --> 01:51:27.800]   So I was in fact, you can request a refund
[01:51:27.800 --> 01:51:29.120]   if they get things wrong.
[01:51:29.120 --> 01:51:30.880]   And I was afraid to hit the refund button
[01:51:30.880 --> 01:51:32.720]   because I feel like I was watched very carefully
[01:51:32.720 --> 01:51:35.360]   for the exact amount of stuff that I did take on that shopping
[01:51:35.360 --> 01:51:35.600]   trip.
[01:51:35.600 --> 01:51:36.800]   But it could get banned.
[01:51:36.800 --> 01:51:39.680]   One of the things that a lot of people don't talk about
[01:51:39.680 --> 01:51:41.960]   is that those shells are actually scales.
[01:51:41.960 --> 01:51:43.960]   They can tell the weight of the thing you took off.
[01:51:43.960 --> 01:51:45.960]   They look at your history of what you bought before.
[01:51:45.960 --> 01:51:47.280]   And they've acted that in.
[01:51:47.280 --> 01:51:48.080]   They look at your face.
[01:51:48.080 --> 01:51:49.160]   They know where your phone is.
[01:51:49.160 --> 01:51:49.440]   It's like--
[01:51:49.440 --> 01:51:50.200]   Now, I'll tell you the scales--
[01:51:50.200 --> 01:51:51.680]   The scales thing--
[01:51:51.680 --> 01:51:53.200]   There's no scales on those shelves.
[01:51:53.200 --> 01:51:53.880]   I've been in there.
[01:51:53.880 --> 01:51:55.280]   There's no-- there's no mechanisms.
[01:51:55.280 --> 01:51:58.120]   They have sensors behind on the back of the shelves.
[01:51:58.120 --> 01:51:59.600]   It is all cameras.
[01:51:59.600 --> 01:52:01.240]   There's no RFID chips.
[01:52:01.240 --> 01:52:02.400]   You take a Coke can.
[01:52:02.400 --> 01:52:03.800]   It is just a Coke can.
[01:52:03.800 --> 01:52:05.480]   They're all about the sensors.
[01:52:05.480 --> 01:52:06.280]   And if you look at--
[01:52:06.280 --> 01:52:07.320]   You would necessarily see the scales.
[01:52:07.320 --> 01:52:08.800]   I mean, like my oven has scales.
[01:52:08.800 --> 01:52:11.080]   But based on the way that these--
[01:52:11.080 --> 01:52:13.360]   I mean, I picked around and tried to move little things
[01:52:13.360 --> 01:52:16.160]   around and all that, whatever would be weight sensitive
[01:52:16.160 --> 01:52:17.400]   may very well be built in.
[01:52:17.400 --> 01:52:19.600]   But I do believe it is more about visual tracking.
[01:52:19.600 --> 01:52:21.360]   And if you look at the quarterly results,
[01:52:21.360 --> 01:52:23.960]   they talk about how they are selling this tech
[01:52:23.960 --> 01:52:27.400]   to other companies for watching warehouse employees,
[01:52:27.400 --> 01:52:29.120]   watching retail shoppers, and everything.
[01:52:29.120 --> 01:52:30.800]   This is a product.
[01:52:30.800 --> 01:52:33.040]   And putting this-- the story is really
[01:52:33.040 --> 01:52:35.000]   selling other companies on what they could get
[01:52:35.000 --> 01:52:37.880]   if they bought into Amazon's vision of tracking customers.
[01:52:37.880 --> 01:52:40.200]   I know that they're-- at least their earlier version
[01:52:40.200 --> 01:52:41.040]   did have scales.
[01:52:41.040 --> 01:52:43.000]   They may have changed it.
[01:52:43.000 --> 01:52:45.560]   But the point is that they're integrating all this thing.
[01:52:45.560 --> 01:52:47.040]   And I agree with you.
[01:52:47.040 --> 01:52:48.240]   I think that there are people who
[01:52:48.240 --> 01:52:50.200]   are double checking things behind the scenes.
[01:52:50.200 --> 01:52:52.160]   That was the case with Facebook's M. Anything
[01:52:52.160 --> 01:52:55.320]   that's super magic AI where money's involved.
[01:52:55.320 --> 01:52:58.080]   They always have a staff of like 20,000 people
[01:52:58.080 --> 01:52:59.320]   like sorting through and making sure that--
[01:52:59.320 --> 01:53:00.880]   Did you see people in the store, Sam?
[01:53:00.880 --> 01:53:03.520]   I mean, employees?
[01:53:03.520 --> 01:53:06.680]   I mean, the whole place has people walking around
[01:53:06.680 --> 01:53:10.080]   with their own little tablets, checking inventory,
[01:53:10.080 --> 01:53:12.000]   moving on and surrounding the look attractive.
[01:53:12.000 --> 01:53:15.360]   There's also a giant window with a kitchen
[01:53:15.360 --> 01:53:16.760]   as you walk to the store.
[01:53:16.760 --> 01:53:19.840]   It's as if Amazon is saying, we haven't replaced workers.
[01:53:19.840 --> 01:53:21.400]   We're just having them do things for you,
[01:53:21.400 --> 01:53:22.560]   such as make fresh food.
[01:53:22.560 --> 01:53:24.560]   Things more interesting, frankly, than just--
[01:53:24.560 --> 01:53:25.160]   Instead of having--
[01:53:25.160 --> 01:53:27.720]   Instead of having a cashier instead of having that way
[01:53:27.720 --> 01:53:28.080]   process.
[01:53:28.080 --> 01:53:29.520]   Because yeah, it is for those who don't know.
[01:53:29.520 --> 01:53:31.360]   You scan a phone, walk in, buy things.
[01:53:31.360 --> 01:53:33.240]   And then you don't even scan anything on the way out.
[01:53:33.240 --> 01:53:33.960]   You just leave.
[01:53:33.960 --> 01:53:37.320]   And then 10 minutes to an hour and 20 minutes later,
[01:53:37.320 --> 01:53:39.600]   based on my experience, you'll get the thing that tells you
[01:53:39.600 --> 01:53:41.920]   exactly what you bought and charge you for it.
[01:53:41.920 --> 01:53:43.600]   And it would be a little silly for anybody
[01:53:43.600 --> 01:53:45.480]   to accuse Amazon of not hiring people.
[01:53:45.480 --> 01:53:48.560]   They literally employ like 500,000 people.
[01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:49.520]   Although the--
[01:53:49.520 --> 01:53:50.520]   Yeah.
[01:53:50.520 --> 01:53:50.880]   The crappy jobs.
[01:53:50.880 --> 01:53:52.520]   The crappy jobs.
[01:53:52.520 --> 01:53:53.360]   And there are a welly--
[01:53:53.360 --> 01:53:55.800]   --study that said when an Amazon warehouse moves in,
[01:53:55.800 --> 01:53:56.880]   yes, there are more jobs.
[01:53:56.880 --> 01:53:58.360]   But every jump goes down.
[01:53:58.360 --> 01:54:02.680]   Amazon just patented a wrist device for an employee
[01:54:02.680 --> 01:54:05.480]   that can track not only your movements and your location,
[01:54:05.480 --> 01:54:07.840]   but also what you're doing with your hands.
[01:54:07.840 --> 01:54:10.000]   And that triggered a whole bunch--
[01:54:10.000 --> 01:54:12.400]   when I tweeted it, that triggered a whole bunch of
[01:54:12.400 --> 01:54:16.560]   unnistically oriented commentary about what you're doing
[01:54:16.560 --> 01:54:17.080]   with your hands.
[01:54:17.080 --> 01:54:19.160]   Interesting about Amazon, though.
[01:54:19.160 --> 01:54:21.360]   And I think the store is telling is they're not
[01:54:21.360 --> 01:54:24.120]   trying to eliminate jobs.
[01:54:24.120 --> 01:54:27.080]   They're trying to make the customers' experience seamless,
[01:54:27.080 --> 01:54:28.280]   frictionless.
[01:54:28.280 --> 01:54:28.880]   And that actually--
[01:54:28.880 --> 01:54:29.280]   Well, let's back up.
[01:54:29.280 --> 01:54:32.640]   That fits better into the Amazon I understand, right?
[01:54:32.640 --> 01:54:34.480]   I think your experience better.
[01:54:34.480 --> 01:54:36.200]   Well, they want your experience to be better,
[01:54:36.200 --> 01:54:38.760]   because they want to own the entire shopping experience.
[01:54:38.760 --> 01:54:41.120]   I mean, that's what the store is trying to finish,
[01:54:41.120 --> 01:54:45.120]   is we own the cloud, we own the credit card processing,
[01:54:45.120 --> 01:54:47.880]   we own so many things in the online space.
[01:54:47.880 --> 01:54:50.600]   And now we're going to own the data in the offline real world
[01:54:50.600 --> 01:54:50.960]   space.
[01:54:50.960 --> 01:54:55.440]   They want to know exactly how we shop for pushing more stuff
[01:54:55.440 --> 01:54:55.840]   at us.
[01:54:55.840 --> 01:54:57.160]   That's really it.
[01:54:57.160 --> 01:54:57.600]   Yeah.
[01:54:57.600 --> 01:55:01.600]   Which brings us to Amazon Health.
[01:55:01.600 --> 01:55:03.800]   Amazon--
[01:55:03.800 --> 01:55:04.800]   I love your explanation.
[01:55:04.800 --> 01:55:06.120]   Yeah, I'm very like, oh.
[01:55:06.120 --> 01:55:07.120]   Sam's going, oh.
[01:55:07.120 --> 01:55:10.680]   Hey, don't have that.
[01:55:10.680 --> 01:55:11.680]   Just two words.
[01:55:11.680 --> 01:55:14.680]   I don't put those two words together very rarely often.
[01:55:14.680 --> 01:55:16.240]   Amazon and Health.
[01:55:16.240 --> 01:55:18.760]   The joint press release was much more limited
[01:55:18.760 --> 01:55:21.480]   than I might imagine the plan is.
[01:55:21.480 --> 01:55:23.640]   But they've partnered with Berkshire Hathaway
[01:55:23.640 --> 01:55:26.440]   and a big financial company, JP Morgan Chase.
[01:55:26.440 --> 01:55:28.600]   Also associated with Health.
[01:55:28.600 --> 01:55:29.040]   Really?
[01:55:29.040 --> 01:55:29.440]   No.
[01:55:29.440 --> 01:55:30.340]   No.
[01:55:30.340 --> 01:55:31.340]   Two.
[01:55:31.340 --> 01:55:32.340]   Two.
[01:55:32.340 --> 01:55:33.000]   They say--
[01:55:33.000 --> 01:55:34.500]   I like how they've built people's wallets.
[01:55:34.500 --> 01:55:36.560]   Address the health care for their employees.
[01:55:36.560 --> 01:55:40.780]   But one has to assume that what Amazon's up to is testing
[01:55:40.780 --> 01:55:45.460]   something on their employees that eventually they'd like to scale up
[01:55:45.460 --> 01:55:46.600]   and do--
[01:55:46.600 --> 01:55:51.140]   be interesting to see if the crisis in American health care
[01:55:51.140 --> 01:55:54.420]   is solved not by, say, a single payer system from government
[01:55:54.420 --> 01:55:57.660]   or some sort of health plan like Medicare.
[01:55:57.660 --> 01:56:00.420]   But in fact, by private corporations--
[01:56:00.420 --> 01:56:00.980]   You know, it already--
[01:56:00.980 --> 01:56:01.740]   --using efficiencies--
[01:56:01.740 --> 01:56:02.700]   --both for the innovation knowledge.
[01:56:02.700 --> 01:56:04.620]   --by a private single payer system.
[01:56:04.620 --> 01:56:07.100]   I'll be talking about Ben Thompson's analysis, which
[01:56:07.100 --> 01:56:09.100]   is really, really brilliant.
[01:56:09.100 --> 01:56:12.580]   But he points out that Kaiser Permanente started out
[01:56:12.580 --> 01:56:14.020]   as a trucking company or something like that.
[01:56:14.020 --> 01:56:15.180]   It was an aluminum company.
[01:56:15.180 --> 01:56:18.740]   And they created for their employees--
[01:56:18.740 --> 01:56:21.020]   effectively, an HMO that I use, and I still use.
[01:56:21.020 --> 01:56:22.500]   And it works very well.
[01:56:22.500 --> 01:56:24.260]   So yeah, I mentioned that as well when
[01:56:24.260 --> 01:56:26.020]   we first talked about Amazon Health.
[01:56:26.020 --> 01:56:28.780]   But Ben's analysis is--
[01:56:28.780 --> 01:56:29.980]   as always, various.
[01:56:29.980 --> 01:56:31.540]   Do we try to get him on the show?
[01:56:31.540 --> 01:56:33.540]   But it's hard for him because he's in Taiwan.
[01:56:33.540 --> 01:56:35.580]   And it's morning-- early morning, he drives his kids
[01:56:35.580 --> 01:56:38.180]   to school during the time we do the show.
[01:56:38.180 --> 01:56:38.940]   So we'll get him.
[01:56:38.940 --> 01:56:42.260]   But what he says is, don't assume that they
[01:56:42.260 --> 01:56:45.900]   want to do a single payer health system.
[01:56:45.900 --> 01:56:47.940]   But what they might be--
[01:56:47.940 --> 01:56:52.980]   his analysis of Amazon is that their goal in everything
[01:56:52.980 --> 01:56:56.260]   is to take a fraction of all economic activity.
[01:56:56.260 --> 01:57:02.420]   And if they want to take a skim of all economic activity,
[01:57:02.420 --> 01:57:06.140]   given that health care is 17.9% of GDP,
[01:57:06.140 --> 01:57:07.660]   this would be a good thing to skim.
[01:57:07.660 --> 01:57:11.500]   But is it Amazon's going to be a health insurance company?
[01:57:11.500 --> 01:57:14.060]   Is it they're going to be providing health?
[01:57:14.060 --> 01:57:16.580]   Or more likely, according to him,
[01:57:16.580 --> 01:57:18.980]   they're going to build out infrastructure for health care
[01:57:18.980 --> 01:57:19.980]   suppliers.
[01:57:19.980 --> 01:57:20.660]   And interfaces.
[01:57:20.660 --> 01:57:22.700]   And they're going to drive costs down.
[01:57:22.700 --> 01:57:25.460]   I'm rooting for Amazon, surprisingly, in this.
[01:57:25.460 --> 01:57:27.500]   Because the health care system in the United States
[01:57:27.500 --> 01:57:29.780]   is so ridiculous now, we pay so much more,
[01:57:29.780 --> 01:57:32.820]   and the outcomes are so much worse than a lot of other places.
[01:57:32.820 --> 01:57:36.060]   And as he astutely points out, everybody's moving
[01:57:36.060 --> 01:57:38.300]   in a different direction in terms of incentives.
[01:57:38.300 --> 01:57:41.060]   The medical industrial complex, meaning
[01:57:41.060 --> 01:57:43.780]   the pharmaceutical companies and the health care providers,
[01:57:43.780 --> 01:57:46.140]   want you to have maximal health problems
[01:57:46.140 --> 01:57:49.180]   so they can give you drugs and have it hospitalization.
[01:57:49.180 --> 01:57:51.340]   The insurance companies want to reduce costs
[01:57:51.340 --> 01:57:53.580]   and the consumers who have insurance don't care.
[01:57:53.580 --> 01:57:55.340]   So it's like everybody's got a different--
[01:57:55.340 --> 01:57:57.260]   if you can get everybody rowing in the same direction,
[01:57:57.260 --> 01:57:59.660]   you could bring down costs and boost quality.
[01:57:59.660 --> 01:58:00.160]   Sure.
[01:58:00.160 --> 01:58:01.620]   Administration costs would go down.
[01:58:01.620 --> 01:58:03.620]   We'd pay a huge amount of our health budget
[01:58:03.620 --> 01:58:05.540]   in the United States, not on health care,
[01:58:05.540 --> 01:58:06.460]   but on administration.
[01:58:06.460 --> 01:58:07.980]   Get in the Amazon ambulance.
[01:58:07.980 --> 01:58:10.620]   They'll have you delivered to the hospital overnight.
[01:58:10.620 --> 01:58:11.340]   It's like a big man.
[01:58:11.340 --> 01:58:13.300]   But if you got to pay for prime if you want that--
[01:58:13.300 --> 01:58:14.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:58:14.300 --> 01:58:15.260]   --meeting from the next hour.
[01:58:15.260 --> 01:58:17.620]   So he says, Amazon, he's not going
[01:58:17.620 --> 01:58:18.980]   to create an insurance company to compete
[01:58:18.980 --> 01:58:20.220]   with other insurance companies.
[01:58:20.220 --> 01:58:22.340]   Or the other pieces of infrastructure.
[01:58:22.340 --> 01:58:26.140]   Amazon will make it possible and desirable for individual--
[01:58:26.140 --> 01:58:28.260]   this is really interesting-- individual health care
[01:58:28.260 --> 01:58:31.420]   providers to come onto their platform directly--
[01:58:31.420 --> 01:58:32.980]   Doctors, Hospitals, Pharmacies.
[01:58:32.980 --> 01:58:37.020]   In other words, it's a platform doing exactly what Amazon's
[01:58:37.020 --> 01:58:38.500]   done in every other respect.
[01:58:38.500 --> 01:58:40.300]   When you buy stuff from Amazon, you often
[01:58:40.300 --> 01:58:43.860]   buy from a company that's not related to Amazon.
[01:58:43.860 --> 01:58:46.500]   I want to forward to the rating system on that.
[01:58:46.500 --> 01:58:49.380]   How many-- your doctor gets five stars or gets review bombed
[01:58:49.380 --> 01:58:50.340]   or whatever.
[01:58:50.340 --> 01:58:52.660]   Berkshire Hathaway is a big health reinsurer.
[01:58:52.660 --> 01:58:57.300]   They insure insurance companies, which is interesting.
[01:58:57.300 --> 01:58:59.060]   And of course, you need financing.
[01:58:59.060 --> 01:58:59.860]   You need capital.
[01:58:59.860 --> 01:59:03.620]   And that's where JPMorgan Chase comes in.
[01:59:03.620 --> 01:59:05.420]   Ben says, needless to say, what I sketched out
[01:59:05.420 --> 01:59:06.620]   is extremely ambitious.
[01:59:06.620 --> 01:59:10.060]   It's easy to let one's mind run wild when it comes to a company
[01:59:10.060 --> 01:59:12.100]   without a name management team or a location.
[01:59:12.100 --> 01:59:13.620]   This is very early days.
[01:59:13.620 --> 01:59:16.460]   He even points out the press release was very modest
[01:59:16.460 --> 01:59:18.380]   in its ambitions.
[01:59:18.380 --> 01:59:22.340]   And we've seen technology solutions to the health crisis,
[01:59:22.340 --> 01:59:25.860]   Google Health and Microsoft Health, which had not done much.
[01:59:25.860 --> 01:59:29.260]   But I think if you're Jeff Bezos, you're absolutely thinking,
[01:59:29.260 --> 01:59:33.540]   how can I get that skim off that big health bill?
[01:59:33.540 --> 01:59:36.780]   And I think Jeff's fairly progressive.
[01:59:36.780 --> 01:59:39.420]   And maybe make the world a better place?
[01:59:39.420 --> 01:59:39.900]   Maybe.
[01:59:39.900 --> 01:59:42.540]   I certainly think that Jeff Bezos is currently
[01:59:42.540 --> 01:59:46.900]   the most visionary CEO in tech today.
[01:59:46.900 --> 01:59:51.300]   And he's visionary in a smart business sense,
[01:59:51.300 --> 01:59:52.980]   not in terms of a great product sense,
[01:59:52.980 --> 01:59:55.460]   but in terms of like, how can I make myself the richest
[01:59:55.460 --> 01:59:57.140]   person in history sense?
[01:59:57.140 --> 02:00:01.820]   And I really don't think they do things small,
[02:00:01.820 --> 02:00:02.860]   especially something like health care,
[02:00:02.860 --> 02:00:05.860]   which is so enormous, so much money to be made.
[02:00:05.860 --> 02:00:09.500]   I think Ben, it's right to sort of give a caveat
[02:00:09.500 --> 02:00:11.900]   that there's no location, et cetera.
[02:00:11.900 --> 02:00:14.620]   But Amazon goes big on this stuff.
[02:00:14.620 --> 02:00:16.060]   And long-term, they think long-term.
[02:00:16.060 --> 02:00:18.700]   That's why they succeed, because they think long-term.
[02:00:18.700 --> 02:00:20.340]   They make really smart moves.
[02:00:20.340 --> 02:00:20.860]   They tweak it.
[02:00:20.860 --> 02:00:22.220]   They try lots of things.
[02:00:22.220 --> 02:00:25.980]   So I really think this is the most significant news
[02:00:25.980 --> 02:00:27.260]   in the world of health care.
[02:00:27.260 --> 02:00:28.220]   I think so.
[02:00:28.220 --> 02:00:29.740]   And potentially, anyway.
[02:00:29.740 --> 02:00:31.220]   Yeah, I mean, this is big news.
[02:00:31.220 --> 02:00:38.060]   I'm like, I feel like kind of icky about this.
[02:00:38.060 --> 02:00:45.260]   And I think the reason why is because I think about a company
[02:00:45.260 --> 02:00:50.340]   like Amazon who has traditionally not treated its workers
[02:00:50.340 --> 02:00:53.300]   super well.
[02:00:53.300 --> 02:00:54.260]   Did I lose everybody?
[02:00:54.260 --> 02:00:55.260]   No, we're still here.
[02:00:55.260 --> 02:00:55.660]   No, no, we're--
[02:00:55.660 --> 02:00:56.660]   OK.
[02:00:56.660 --> 02:00:57.580]   We're fascinated.
[02:00:57.580 --> 02:00:58.260]   We're wrapped.
[02:00:58.260 --> 02:01:00.660]   I sound just got cut really hard.
[02:01:00.660 --> 02:01:01.620]   It was really weird.
[02:01:01.620 --> 02:01:02.220]   In here, a pin drop.
[02:01:02.220 --> 02:01:06.740]   But Amazon is a company that traditionally has not treated
[02:01:06.740 --> 02:01:07.900]   its employees very well.
[02:01:07.900 --> 02:01:11.820]   And there are rumors that we see all the time, every year,
[02:01:11.820 --> 02:01:14.380]   at least a quarter or six months,
[02:01:14.380 --> 02:01:18.540]   we see these stories come out of even in executive levels
[02:01:18.540 --> 02:01:20.380]   of management and things like that.
[02:01:20.380 --> 02:01:22.340]   People saying that the turnover is very high.
[02:01:22.340 --> 02:01:24.860]   There's so much churn happening at Amazon.
[02:01:24.860 --> 02:01:27.380]   And so I really--
[02:01:27.380 --> 02:01:31.540]   it's one of those things where I feel like, obviously,
[02:01:31.540 --> 02:01:34.540]   no one is going to be a disruptor in the way of our government
[02:01:34.540 --> 02:01:35.660]   here in the United States.
[02:01:35.660 --> 02:01:38.500]   Like, I don't see that happening for a long time.
[02:01:38.500 --> 02:01:41.620]   So some disruption is great.
[02:01:41.620 --> 02:01:45.260]   And I think in that way, I'm glad Amazon is stepping forward
[02:01:45.260 --> 02:01:47.220]   and saying, we want to disrupt the space,
[02:01:47.220 --> 02:01:48.780]   because it does need disruption.
[02:01:48.780 --> 02:01:51.620]   It needs to be pulled forward into the 21st century.
[02:01:51.620 --> 02:01:56.100]   But on that same note, there's just so many ways
[02:01:56.100 --> 02:01:58.860]   that if you think about the worst-case scenario,
[02:01:58.860 --> 02:02:01.620]   it just seems so overwhelming.
[02:02:01.620 --> 02:02:03.140]   Can I take you back on this?
[02:02:03.140 --> 02:02:04.500]   Yes, please.
[02:02:04.500 --> 02:02:07.140]   Yeah, because we're already seeing at Whole Foods,
[02:02:07.140 --> 02:02:09.940]   they're struggling to keep produce on the shelves
[02:02:09.940 --> 02:02:12.340]   because of the changing of the inventory system that's
[02:02:12.340 --> 02:02:13.180]   coming with Amazon.
[02:02:13.180 --> 02:02:15.460]   Yeah, that inventory system was switched before Amazon bought it.
[02:02:15.460 --> 02:02:16.300]   That was like a--
[02:02:16.300 --> 02:02:17.300]   I know.
[02:02:17.300 --> 02:02:19.500]   I'm segmenting that into worrying about whether they
[02:02:19.500 --> 02:02:20.700]   can keep the kidneys in stock.
[02:02:20.700 --> 02:02:23.740]   But also, Amazon is notorious--
[02:02:23.740 --> 02:02:24.300]   I'm sorry, sir.
[02:02:24.300 --> 02:02:25.420]   We're all out of kidneys.
[02:02:25.420 --> 02:02:26.500]   Would you like a new heart?
[02:02:26.500 --> 02:02:27.340]   Sorry.
[02:02:27.340 --> 02:02:31.140]   Notorious or Seattle for a lack of charitable works.
[02:02:31.140 --> 02:02:33.820]   It is not a company that gives a lot to Seattle.
[02:02:33.820 --> 02:02:35.740]   They took over a space called Mary's Place,
[02:02:35.740 --> 02:02:37.540]   just as a reaction when local press said,
[02:02:37.540 --> 02:02:41.260]   why don't you give your not philanthropic around Seattle
[02:02:41.260 --> 02:02:43.940]   the way other like Microsoft and companies like that are?
[02:02:43.940 --> 02:02:47.220]   That is-- they're very much in that and Randian libertarian
[02:02:47.220 --> 02:02:50.300]   state, and that can maybe shake up health care.
[02:02:50.300 --> 02:02:54.340]   But I do also worry in terms of their general humanitarian
[02:02:54.340 --> 02:02:57.620]   track record is not as awesome as other tech companies
[02:02:57.620 --> 02:02:59.820]   that make sure to put that piece forward.
[02:02:59.820 --> 02:03:01.660]   So when you're saying, we're going to really be there
[02:03:01.660 --> 02:03:05.260]   for the most important business of all human life,
[02:03:05.260 --> 02:03:06.220]   yeah, I'm anxious as well.
[02:03:06.220 --> 02:03:07.860]   They're the ultimate mixed bag.
[02:03:07.860 --> 02:03:10.700]   Have they benefited literacy or have they not?
[02:03:10.700 --> 02:03:13.300]   Have they ruined it by wrecking the publishing companies?
[02:03:13.300 --> 02:03:18.380]   Or have they saved it by making literate works
[02:03:18.380 --> 02:03:18.900]   for a sort of--
[02:03:18.900 --> 02:03:19.900]   I'm probably projected.
[02:03:19.900 --> 02:03:22.180]   I think somebody was going to spill that space.
[02:03:22.180 --> 02:03:25.380]   I put myself in Jeff Bezos' brain.
[02:03:25.380 --> 02:03:30.700]   And I'm thinking these things are distractions for him.
[02:03:30.700 --> 02:03:34.380]   He clearly has a vision of some kind
[02:03:34.380 --> 02:03:36.660]   to get a skim of all the economic activity.
[02:03:36.660 --> 02:03:38.580]   OK, maybe that's it.
[02:03:38.580 --> 02:03:41.020]   Maybe he is totally driven by money.
[02:03:41.020 --> 02:03:45.660]   But I think it would be a mistake to say, well,
[02:03:45.660 --> 02:03:49.820]   because they're not philanthropic, they're not humanitarian.
[02:03:49.820 --> 02:03:51.500]   I just think that Jeff at this point
[02:03:51.500 --> 02:03:53.940]   thinks the most humanitarian thing he could do
[02:03:53.940 --> 02:03:57.860]   is to focus and move forward with whatever this vision is.
[02:03:57.860 --> 02:04:01.900]   Ben, I think makes a really good case
[02:04:01.900 --> 02:04:05.540]   that what you're seeing here is a disruption
[02:04:05.540 --> 02:04:07.780]   of a post-World War II economic system, not just
[02:04:07.780 --> 02:04:11.700]   in health care, but in general, and that the institutions don't
[02:04:11.700 --> 02:04:15.060]   just slowly one by one fall like 10 pins.
[02:04:15.060 --> 02:04:18.660]   But instead, the edifice gets hollowed out from the inside.
[02:04:18.660 --> 02:04:20.020]   It seems to be standing.
[02:04:20.020 --> 02:04:23.500]   And then when it collapses, it collapses far quicker
[02:04:23.500 --> 02:04:25.780]   than anyone expected.
[02:04:25.780 --> 02:04:28.140]   But what it takes is a lot of patience.
[02:04:28.140 --> 02:04:31.060]   And somebody who's willing to say, oh,
[02:04:31.060 --> 02:04:34.740]   I thought we'd have put publishers out of business by now.
[02:04:34.740 --> 02:04:35.860]   This is taking too long.
[02:04:35.860 --> 02:04:40.180]   No, somebody's got a really long-term vision.
[02:04:40.180 --> 02:04:44.340]   Jeff is undeniably very smart about how he's going about this
[02:04:44.340 --> 02:04:46.020]   and doing it, not that he doesn't make mistakes,
[02:04:46.020 --> 02:04:47.860]   but it's planned.
[02:04:47.860 --> 02:04:50.020]   It's thoughtful, right?
[02:04:50.020 --> 02:04:53.060]   And I think you shouldn't assume he's anti-humanitarian.
[02:04:53.060 --> 02:04:56.300]   I feel like he probably is fairly progressive.
[02:04:56.300 --> 02:04:59.460]   But he just don't-- well, this is not my mission right now.
[02:04:59.460 --> 02:05:01.420]   Somebody else can do the charitable work.
[02:05:01.420 --> 02:05:02.940]   We'll have plenty of time for that later.
[02:05:02.940 --> 02:05:04.420]   Bill Gates famously said that.
[02:05:04.420 --> 02:05:06.180]   He said, I'm not going to do charity
[02:05:06.180 --> 02:05:08.700]   until I can devote enough time to do it right.
[02:05:08.700 --> 02:05:10.980]   Look at Mark Zuckerberg giving millions to Newark,
[02:05:10.980 --> 02:05:12.940]   just throwing it away.
[02:05:12.940 --> 02:05:17.020]   Gates, once he was retired, did focus entirely on it.
[02:05:17.020 --> 02:05:17.460]   A charity.
[02:05:17.460 --> 02:05:19.460]   But you might have said years ago, all Bill Gates,
[02:05:19.460 --> 02:05:20.580]   he's not a humanitarian.
[02:05:20.580 --> 02:05:22.940]   I don't think that you should tar him with that brush.
[02:05:22.940 --> 02:05:24.780]   I do think there's something going on.
[02:05:24.780 --> 02:05:29.260]   And I think Jeff Bezos is somebody very interesting.
[02:05:29.260 --> 02:05:34.020]   At least as interesting as Steve Jobs was, or Tim Cook,
[02:05:34.020 --> 02:05:35.460]   or even Elon Musk.
[02:05:35.460 --> 02:05:37.660]   And in the same way as Steve Jobs,
[02:05:37.660 --> 02:05:42.260]   the basic formula for Apple under Steve Jobs was,
[02:05:42.260 --> 02:05:44.660]   let's look at the future and see what's going to be happening.
[02:05:44.660 --> 02:05:47.620]   Let's see who's providing that technology today
[02:05:47.620 --> 02:05:50.180]   and all the things that are wrong with that technology.
[02:05:50.180 --> 02:05:52.020]   Let's fix all those things that are wrong.
[02:05:52.020 --> 02:05:53.860]   And then come in that market right
[02:05:53.860 --> 02:05:55.740]   as it's on the upswing with something that's
[02:05:55.740 --> 02:05:56.900]   way better than anything else.
[02:05:56.900 --> 02:05:57.820]   That's kind of there.
[02:05:57.820 --> 02:06:00.580]   And that's what he's theoretically doing with health care.
[02:06:00.580 --> 02:06:04.620]   And the thing that has to be talked about humanitarianism,
[02:06:04.620 --> 02:06:07.740]   how humanitarian is the current medical system?
[02:06:07.740 --> 02:06:08.940]   It's actually a disaster.
[02:06:08.940 --> 02:06:13.140]   If you're poor in America, you get terrible health care.
[02:06:13.140 --> 02:06:15.540]   If you're wealthy, you probably get the best health care
[02:06:15.540 --> 02:06:16.060]   in the world.
[02:06:16.060 --> 02:06:18.500]   But if you're a poor single mother,
[02:06:18.500 --> 02:06:22.180]   your infancy mortality rate is down there
[02:06:22.180 --> 02:06:24.820]   with a third world country.
[02:06:24.820 --> 02:06:28.620]   So the current situation is a catastrophe.
[02:06:28.620 --> 02:06:29.980]   And if you can improve that in any way--
[02:06:29.980 --> 02:06:31.620]   Couldn't get any worse.
[02:06:31.620 --> 02:06:32.820]   Well, actually, it could.
[02:06:32.820 --> 02:06:36.900]   But he specializes in the one thing we need,
[02:06:36.900 --> 02:06:37.940]   bring down the cost.
[02:06:37.940 --> 02:06:41.860]   Here we are in a rich country with great technology,
[02:06:41.860 --> 02:06:43.700]   super advanced medicine.
[02:06:43.700 --> 02:06:47.140]   And we get about the worst medical care in the developed
[02:06:47.140 --> 02:06:49.780]   word there is for the money we spend.
[02:06:49.780 --> 02:06:50.940]   For the average people, yes.
[02:06:50.940 --> 02:06:52.420]   It's very unfortunate.
[02:06:52.420 --> 02:06:53.140]   I just wonder.
[02:06:53.140 --> 02:06:59.300]   I am very concerned about what happens when your employer also
[02:06:59.300 --> 02:07:03.300]   becomes your health insurer and your health provider.
[02:07:03.300 --> 02:07:06.980]   Like that, to me, seems very dangerous.
[02:07:06.980 --> 02:07:10.620]   And it has to be done well, and it has to be done right.
[02:07:10.620 --> 02:07:13.180]   And it has to be done compassionately.
[02:07:13.180 --> 02:07:14.020]   And based on--
[02:07:14.020 --> 02:07:16.620]   I don't think that's what he's doing, by the way.
[02:07:16.620 --> 02:07:17.060]   I just--
[02:07:17.060 --> 02:07:18.460]   We don't know what he's doing.
[02:07:18.460 --> 02:07:19.820]   I don't think that's what he's doing.
[02:07:19.820 --> 02:07:20.740]   I think Ben's right.
[02:07:20.740 --> 02:07:24.020]   He's not creating a health care system.
[02:07:24.020 --> 02:07:28.100]   He's creating a platform that individual providers can sit on
[02:07:28.100 --> 02:07:30.660]   and stop worrying about--
[02:07:30.660 --> 02:07:33.180]   Administration is a huge percentage of the cost of health
[02:07:33.180 --> 02:07:33.380]   care.
[02:07:33.380 --> 02:07:35.100]   Just stop worrying about that.
[02:07:35.100 --> 02:07:36.580]   I mean, ultimately, whatever happens--
[02:07:36.580 --> 02:07:37.580]   It's the gravid--
[02:07:37.580 --> 02:07:37.980]   I'll go ahead.
[02:07:37.980 --> 02:07:38.620]   Go ahead.
[02:07:38.620 --> 02:07:40.260]   Yeah, whatever ultimately happens
[02:07:40.260 --> 02:07:43.020]   is we have Amazon's track record.
[02:07:43.020 --> 02:07:45.940]   And we also have an American health care world that
[02:07:45.940 --> 02:07:49.340]   has very, very rigid big pharma that's
[02:07:49.340 --> 02:07:51.380]   very interested in continuing to make a lot of money.
[02:07:51.380 --> 02:07:55.260]   So whatever comes forward is not going to happen as super fast
[02:07:55.260 --> 02:07:59.300]   as we would love a smart nimble business to pull off.
[02:07:59.300 --> 02:08:01.260]   So whatever does happen, there is money in it--
[02:08:01.260 --> 02:08:02.340]   Big pharma is obvious.
[02:08:02.340 --> 02:08:03.340]   --in an opportunity.
[02:08:03.340 --> 02:08:04.140]   Yeah, there's money in it.
[02:08:04.140 --> 02:08:05.940]   We know Amazon wants to take that on.
[02:08:05.940 --> 02:08:09.020]   They've been getting pharmacy licenses and many--
[02:08:09.020 --> 02:08:12.260]   I mean, they're slow.
[02:08:12.260 --> 02:08:15.260]   The problem is you won't know until it's done,
[02:08:15.260 --> 02:08:18.980]   whether Bezos is benign, evil.
[02:08:18.980 --> 02:08:20.100]   It's going to happen.
[02:08:20.100 --> 02:08:21.500]   And we're going to be stuck with it.
[02:08:21.500 --> 02:08:23.340]   We're going to be living in a new world order.
[02:08:23.340 --> 02:08:25.060]   When he's the emperor of the world.
[02:08:25.060 --> 02:08:26.060]   And he's--
[02:08:26.060 --> 02:08:27.900]   And so it's hard-- you've got to read the tea leaves,
[02:08:27.900 --> 02:08:28.620]   but it's very hard.
[02:08:28.620 --> 02:08:31.700]   I don't know how easy it is to understand what his strategy is.
[02:08:31.700 --> 02:08:35.700]   But I have a feeling we'll be talking a lot more about this
[02:08:35.700 --> 02:08:37.300]   in the years to come.
[02:08:37.300 --> 02:08:38.940]   Let's take a break, wrap this thing up.
[02:08:38.940 --> 02:08:43.380]   We've been having so much fun with Sam and Ashley and Mike.
[02:08:43.380 --> 02:08:47.460]   And I almost hate to slow it down and stop it.
[02:08:47.460 --> 02:08:50.340]   But there's a super bowl going on.
[02:08:50.340 --> 02:08:51.060]   Let's not stop it.
[02:08:51.060 --> 02:08:51.740]   Let's just slow it down.
[02:08:51.740 --> 02:08:57.700]   Come on, Leo, give us your best ad-adjacent super-owl ad
[02:08:57.700 --> 02:08:58.540]   grade right now.
[02:08:58.540 --> 02:09:00.740]   Well, if you think about it, super bowl's
[02:09:00.740 --> 02:09:01.740]   about a couple of things.
[02:09:01.740 --> 02:09:03.300]   Yeah, football.
[02:09:03.300 --> 02:09:04.580]   Yeah, commercials.
[02:09:04.580 --> 02:09:06.380]   In my mind, super bowl's about eating.
[02:09:06.380 --> 02:09:06.940]   That's right.
[02:09:06.940 --> 02:09:08.380]   It's really about food.
[02:09:08.380 --> 02:09:08.780]   Isn't it?
[02:09:08.780 --> 02:09:09.260]   It is.
[02:09:09.260 --> 02:09:10.420]   It's about food.
[02:09:10.420 --> 02:09:11.900]   Good food.
[02:09:11.900 --> 02:09:12.660]   And when I--
[02:09:12.660 --> 02:09:13.260]   Beer.
[02:09:13.260 --> 02:09:14.100]   And beer.
[02:09:14.100 --> 02:09:15.220]   Beer and food.
[02:09:15.220 --> 02:09:17.180]   Actually, you know, Blue Apron has wine now.
[02:09:17.180 --> 02:09:18.260]   Oh, that's so great.
[02:09:18.260 --> 02:09:20.700]   They have wine pairings with every Blue Apron meal.
[02:09:20.700 --> 02:09:22.540]   They know all about wine, so you don't have to.
[02:09:22.540 --> 02:09:23.340]   That's right.
[02:09:23.340 --> 02:09:24.500]   Oh, I love Blue Apron.
[02:09:24.500 --> 02:09:27.980]   Blue Apron delivers all the ingredients to your door.
[02:09:27.980 --> 02:09:30.740]   You need to make an amazing meal tonight
[02:09:30.740 --> 02:09:33.020]   for your super bowl family.
[02:09:33.020 --> 02:09:35.020]   They set the highest standard for ingredients.
[02:09:35.020 --> 02:09:37.700]   Their goal is to make incredible home cooking
[02:09:37.700 --> 02:09:40.340]   accessible to everyone while supporting a more
[02:09:40.340 --> 02:09:41.900]   sustainable food system and building
[02:09:41.900 --> 02:09:43.700]   a community of home chefs.
[02:09:43.700 --> 02:09:45.060]   It is fun to cook.
[02:09:45.060 --> 02:09:46.340]   But it's daunting.
[02:09:46.340 --> 02:09:47.500]   You've got to plan a meal.
[02:09:47.500 --> 02:09:49.020]   You've got to shop for the meal.
[02:09:49.020 --> 02:09:50.700]   You've got to choose the right ingredients.
[02:09:50.700 --> 02:09:52.100]   You've got to figure it all out.
[02:09:52.100 --> 02:09:54.020]   Blue Apron makes it so simple.
[02:09:54.020 --> 02:09:56.060]   Fresh, pre-portioned ingredients,
[02:09:56.060 --> 02:09:58.660]   step-by-step recipes, they come to your door.
[02:09:58.660 --> 02:10:01.260]   You can come up in 45 minutes or less, save money, too,
[02:10:01.260 --> 02:10:01.660]   by the way.
[02:10:01.660 --> 02:10:03.940]   They're less than shopping for yourself.
[02:10:03.940 --> 02:10:05.700]   They offer 12 new recipes every week.
[02:10:05.700 --> 02:10:07.340]   You pick two, three, or four based
[02:10:07.340 --> 02:10:10.100]   on what needs fits your schedule.
[02:10:10.100 --> 02:10:11.100]   It's not a subscription.
[02:10:11.100 --> 02:10:13.100]   You don't have to get a box unless you go there
[02:10:13.100 --> 02:10:15.540]   and you look at the menu and pick what you want.
[02:10:15.540 --> 02:10:18.060]   The menu changes all the time based on what's in season.
[02:10:18.060 --> 02:10:20.980]   They never repeat a recipe more than once a year.
[02:10:20.980 --> 02:10:23.060]   Although lately they're bringing back fan favorites,
[02:10:23.060 --> 02:10:23.980]   which is really fun.
[02:10:23.980 --> 02:10:25.780]   Some of the recipes I'd never tried before,
[02:10:25.780 --> 02:10:29.300]   like strip steak and potatoes with spicy maple collard greens.
[02:10:29.300 --> 02:10:33.620]   Can I just say, if you master collard greens,
[02:10:33.620 --> 02:10:35.340]   your life will change forever.
[02:10:35.340 --> 02:10:37.260]   And that's one thing that happens with Blue Apron.
[02:10:37.260 --> 02:10:40.300]   I will make these and then I'll go, oh, I get it.
[02:10:40.300 --> 02:10:44.060]   And from then on, I have now a new ingredient in my repertoire,
[02:10:44.060 --> 02:10:47.380]   spicy chicken and stir-fried vegetables with jasmine rice.
[02:10:47.380 --> 02:10:49.780]   Soy glazed Korean rice cakes.
[02:10:49.780 --> 02:10:51.020]   This is a vegetarian one.
[02:10:51.020 --> 02:10:54.620]   Soy glazed Korean rice cakes with broccoli and soft boiled eggs.
[02:10:54.620 --> 02:10:57.460]   I mean, my mouth is watering.
[02:10:57.460 --> 02:11:00.660]   Creamy fusilli buccati pasta.
[02:11:00.660 --> 02:11:03.700]   Again, a new ingredient to me that is amazing.
[02:11:03.700 --> 02:11:06.820]   I love buccati pasta now with fried rosemary.
[02:11:06.820 --> 02:11:08.340]   And never fried rosemary and walnuts.
[02:11:08.340 --> 02:11:09.500]   Some of the ingredients are incredible.
[02:11:09.500 --> 02:11:11.180]   I send you, you can't find in the store.
[02:11:11.180 --> 02:11:13.020]   You just go to some obscure like--
[02:11:13.020 --> 02:11:15.340]   Stuff I had to order.
[02:11:15.340 --> 02:11:17.500]   Because-- but now I know and I can use it,
[02:11:17.500 --> 02:11:19.020]   and it really has made me a better cook.
[02:11:19.020 --> 02:11:20.140]   Plus, it's fun.
[02:11:20.140 --> 02:11:22.100]   The family plan of get the kids involved,
[02:11:22.100 --> 02:11:25.620]   and nothing's better than having your kids learn how to cook.
[02:11:25.620 --> 02:11:27.540]   And there's just something magical about cooking
[02:11:27.540 --> 02:11:30.980]   with your family and just making an amazing meal for them,
[02:11:30.980 --> 02:11:33.140]   even if you've never cooked before, especially
[02:11:33.140 --> 02:11:34.340]   if you've never cooked before.
[02:11:34.340 --> 02:11:36.220]   This is an eye opener.
[02:11:36.220 --> 02:11:39.180]   Incredible ingredients, chef-designed recipes.
[02:11:39.180 --> 02:11:39.900]   The best.
[02:11:39.900 --> 02:11:43.260]   Blue apron lets you see what the power of food can do.
[02:11:43.260 --> 02:11:46.420]   And we're treating you to $30 off your first order,
[02:11:46.420 --> 02:11:50.660]   plus free shipping if you go to blueapron.com/twit.
[02:11:50.660 --> 02:11:52.220]   Blueapron.com/twit.
[02:11:52.220 --> 02:11:55.740]   Check out this week's menu and get $30 off and free shipping.
[02:11:55.740 --> 02:11:58.060]   Blueapron.com/twit.
[02:11:58.060 --> 02:12:01.020]   Blueapron is a better way to cook.
[02:12:01.020 --> 02:12:05.700]   I did not get my Super Bowl dip from Blueapron.
[02:12:05.700 --> 02:12:08.020]   If I tell you what it is, you'll say, no, you definitely
[02:12:08.020 --> 02:12:08.740]   did not.
[02:12:08.740 --> 02:12:11.300]   This was a producer at Tech TV used to make this.
[02:12:11.300 --> 02:12:15.140]   And now out of nostalgia, you get a hunk of cream cheese.
[02:12:15.140 --> 02:12:15.860]   Oh boy.
[02:12:15.860 --> 02:12:17.780]   And a can of chili.
[02:12:17.780 --> 02:12:21.380]   And you put them in the crockpot, and you melt it all together.
[02:12:21.380 --> 02:12:23.060]   And you get farts.
[02:12:23.060 --> 02:12:24.180]   You get wooden farts.
[02:12:24.180 --> 02:12:29.980]   You get these big-- you know, the big dipping fritos.
[02:12:29.980 --> 02:12:30.980]   And that's good eating.
[02:12:30.980 --> 02:12:33.860]   Not Blueapron quality, but easy.
[02:12:33.860 --> 02:12:34.380]   Easy.
[02:12:34.380 --> 02:12:34.380]   Easy.
[02:12:34.380 --> 02:12:36.100]   Well, you can just dump it in.
[02:12:36.100 --> 02:12:38.340]   It's simmering in the crockpot right now,
[02:12:38.340 --> 02:12:39.340]   waiting for me.
[02:12:39.340 --> 02:12:39.700]   Yes, sir.
[02:12:39.700 --> 02:12:42.460]   Our neighbors across the street one year for New Year's Eve.
[02:12:42.460 --> 02:12:43.620]   She's like, come in.
[02:12:43.620 --> 02:12:45.700]   I'm like, we don't hang out with them a whole lot.
[02:12:45.700 --> 02:12:48.460]   And she's like, come in and have chips and dip with us.
[02:12:48.460 --> 02:12:50.380]   And she's like, oh, I have to make it.
[02:12:50.380 --> 02:12:53.860]   And she got a giant block of cream cheese, a can of chili,
[02:12:53.860 --> 02:12:56.940]   and a block of like, velveeta.
[02:12:56.940 --> 02:12:57.540]   Oh, she's fancy.
[02:12:57.540 --> 02:13:00.500]   And just put it all in a bowl and threw it in the microwave.
[02:13:00.500 --> 02:13:01.380]   Yeah, you can micro it.
[02:13:01.380 --> 02:13:02.260]   Like two minutes.
[02:13:02.260 --> 02:13:04.420]   And just stirred it up and was like, dip's ready.
[02:13:04.420 --> 02:13:07.140]   And I was like, oh boy, I've never eaten that before in my whole life.
[02:13:07.140 --> 02:13:08.620]   And it was delicious.
[02:13:08.620 --> 02:13:10.100]   And I hated how much I enjoyed it.
[02:13:10.100 --> 02:13:10.780]   I know.
[02:13:10.780 --> 02:13:11.820]   I hate it.
[02:13:11.820 --> 02:13:13.900]   And you will hate it tomorrow even more.
[02:13:13.900 --> 02:13:16.860]   I'm just saying, please America, don't double dip.
[02:13:16.860 --> 02:13:18.020]   Just put the chip in.
[02:13:18.020 --> 02:13:18.500]   Yeah, don't double dip.
[02:13:18.500 --> 02:13:19.540]   Put in your mouth and end it.
[02:13:19.540 --> 02:13:22.260]   Yeah, just because the chips big, don't get tempted.
[02:13:22.260 --> 02:13:23.420]   True.
[02:13:23.420 --> 02:13:25.140]   And have I missed any stories that were
[02:13:25.140 --> 02:13:26.380]   allowing into the stories?
[02:13:26.380 --> 02:13:29.540]   Mario Kart's coming to smartphones, not till 2019, though.
[02:13:29.540 --> 02:13:32.700]   I hate to even say it because everybody excited.
[02:13:32.700 --> 02:13:34.740]   Although it's good news, it looks like Nintendo really
[02:13:34.740 --> 02:13:39.540]   has done well with its first foray into smartphone apps.
[02:13:39.540 --> 02:13:40.140]   And we'll do more.
[02:13:40.140 --> 02:13:41.140]   I'm glad to hear that.
[02:13:41.140 --> 02:13:42.140]   Except for me, Tomo.
[02:13:42.140 --> 02:13:42.940]   Except for me, Tomo.
[02:13:42.940 --> 02:13:44.140]   We don't want to talk about that.
[02:13:44.140 --> 02:13:44.740]   Don't want me to.
[02:13:44.740 --> 02:13:46.860]   Don't get me started on Nintendo smartphone apps.
[02:13:46.860 --> 02:13:47.940]   We'll have another hour on the one.
[02:13:47.940 --> 02:13:49.020]   What do you think?
[02:13:49.020 --> 02:13:52.540]   What do you think about the rumor Microsoft might buy electronic arts?
[02:13:52.540 --> 02:13:54.340]   No, not even close.
[02:13:54.340 --> 02:13:59.660]   They, this was a guy going, getting information from a source where Microsoft said,
[02:13:59.660 --> 02:14:01.060]   we're looking into buying things.
[02:14:01.060 --> 02:14:03.780]   That happens like every five days at Microsoft.
[02:14:03.780 --> 02:14:04.980]   We have a lot of money.
[02:14:04.980 --> 02:14:06.900]   Who could we possibly acquire?
[02:14:06.900 --> 02:14:08.180]   What's the risk analysis?
[02:14:08.180 --> 02:14:11.860]   I mean, EA stock went up a bazillion dollars even without that information.
[02:14:11.860 --> 02:14:15.620]   Just, there's just so much value in that and they wouldn't get much payoff.
[02:14:15.620 --> 02:14:18.500]   They're going to go for something that is known but small.
[02:14:18.500 --> 02:14:25.100]   So Minecraft is like the best example of the kind of company that, or company kind of product
[02:14:25.100 --> 02:14:25.820]   that they would go for.
[02:14:25.820 --> 02:14:30.500]   A company known for one thing that's successful, that they can make t-shirts and lego sets out of.
[02:14:30.500 --> 02:14:36.500]   And so therefore, PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds, which is a huge game right now and it's on Xbox One,
[02:14:36.500 --> 02:14:42.580]   it's the console exclusive, their publisher is more likely to be bought out because it is a company
[02:14:42.580 --> 02:14:46.180]   with one successful, we could sell shirts based on a kind of product.
[02:14:46.180 --> 02:14:48.820]   So that's what I see possibly those guys as well.
[02:14:48.820 --> 02:14:52.340]   That's the kind of product that they would go after.
[02:14:52.340 --> 02:14:57.940]   EA, too big a portfolio, too much like negativity in the mix with all of their loot box crafts.
[02:14:57.940 --> 02:14:59.700]   So much negativity right now.
[02:14:59.700 --> 02:15:04.180]   But I have to say, I don't know, do you guys agree that Minecraft,
[02:15:04.180 --> 02:15:07.060]   Microsoft has been a wonderful steward for Minecraft.
[02:15:07.060 --> 02:15:11.860]   They're going to do, there's a Minecraft chemistry edition coming out.
[02:15:11.860 --> 02:15:13.380]   Well, they didn't mess it up.
[02:15:13.380 --> 02:15:18.660]   They kept on publishing it on other systems and that was huge because they understood it's about
[02:15:18.660 --> 02:15:22.180]   owning the entire chain, not about making it Windows only.
[02:15:22.180 --> 02:15:27.060]   And that, I think there've been some smarter folks in the gaming and Xbox teams at Microsoft
[02:15:27.060 --> 02:15:32.980]   that understand the long play is not, it has to only be on Xbox as much as we at Microsoft
[02:15:32.980 --> 02:15:34.820]   are going to have legitimate things all over the place.
[02:15:34.820 --> 02:15:36.580]   So that's why I don't think PUBG is good.
[02:15:36.580 --> 02:15:37.620]   We want the IP everywhere.
[02:15:37.620 --> 02:15:38.740]   PUBG is not quite as good a fit.
[02:15:38.740 --> 02:15:40.980]   Minecraft has this great educational potential.
[02:15:40.980 --> 02:15:46.740]   You can get kids into the Microsoft universe in all sorts of different ways.
[02:15:46.740 --> 02:15:47.700]   Killer in HoloLens.
[02:15:47.700 --> 02:15:50.420]   Oh yeah, won't that be fun?
[02:15:50.420 --> 02:15:51.060]   Walk around.
[02:15:51.060 --> 02:15:55.380]   You look at those demos that they've shown off at build is pretty impressive.
[02:15:56.100 --> 02:15:56.500]   Yeah.
[02:15:56.500 --> 02:15:58.020]   All right.
[02:15:58.020 --> 02:15:59.140]   Yeah.
[02:15:59.140 --> 02:16:02.020]   Anything else you guys want to talk about or should we just go home?
[02:16:02.020 --> 02:16:07.540]   I have to go right about the two crazy things that were just teased at the Superb Owl.
[02:16:07.540 --> 02:16:13.540]   Number one, the first solo film trailer is only like 20 seconds, but it's there.
[02:16:13.540 --> 02:16:14.660]   Chewbacca's in it.
[02:16:14.660 --> 02:16:15.380]   So that's great.
[02:16:15.380 --> 02:16:19.460]   And then number two, Netflix just announced a Cloverfield movie that's going to screen
[02:16:19.460 --> 02:16:20.900]   as soon as the Super Bowl's over.
[02:16:20.900 --> 02:16:21.380]   What?
[02:16:21.380 --> 02:16:21.700]   Done.
[02:16:21.700 --> 02:16:22.020]   Wow.
[02:16:22.020 --> 02:16:22.660]   Netflix.
[02:16:22.660 --> 02:16:23.540]   The Night of the World.
[02:16:23.540 --> 02:16:24.820]   JJ Abrams produced it.
[02:16:24.820 --> 02:16:25.460]   She killed it.
[02:16:25.460 --> 02:16:26.500]   That's happening.
[02:16:26.500 --> 02:16:28.100]   This is why Apple needs to buy them.
[02:16:28.100 --> 02:16:29.060]   Kill it.
[02:16:29.060 --> 02:16:29.940]   No, no.
[02:16:29.940 --> 02:16:32.660]   I mean, Netflix, stay away from Apple.
[02:16:32.660 --> 02:16:33.780]   Just keep doing what you're doing.
[02:16:33.780 --> 02:16:35.700]   That's what I say.
[02:16:35.700 --> 02:16:36.820]   Same to you.
[02:16:36.820 --> 02:16:37.940]   Sam Mashkovich.
[02:16:37.940 --> 02:16:39.300]   R's Technic.
[02:16:39.300 --> 02:16:40.340]   Keep doing what you're doing.
[02:16:40.340 --> 02:16:42.260]   Tech Culture Editor at Sam Red on the Twitter.
[02:16:42.260 --> 02:16:43.780]   Thank you so much for being here.
[02:16:43.780 --> 02:16:46.100]   I'm going to keep doing this dance until you cut me off.
[02:16:46.100 --> 02:16:47.220]   Go right about the solo.
[02:16:47.220 --> 02:16:47.460]   Go over.
[02:16:47.460 --> 02:16:48.180]   Keep stay on him.
[02:16:48.180 --> 02:16:48.660]   Stay on him.
[02:16:51.460 --> 02:16:52.900]   Right about the solo team.
[02:16:52.900 --> 02:16:57.140]   The Black Mirror season five.
[02:16:57.140 --> 02:16:58.900]   Oh, oh, yikes.
[02:16:58.900 --> 02:17:00.500]   Kinger nightmares for everyone.
[02:17:00.500 --> 02:17:01.220]   Yes, yikes.
[02:17:01.220 --> 02:17:02.820]   That's Ashley is.
[02:17:02.820 --> 02:17:03.140]   Sketha.
[02:17:03.140 --> 02:17:04.100]   We love Ashley.
[02:17:04.100 --> 02:17:05.780]   Always great to have you on from CNET.
[02:17:05.780 --> 02:17:07.220]   And I look forward to seeing what you're doing.
[02:17:07.220 --> 02:17:09.140]   What you drop tomorrow at CNET.com.
[02:17:09.140 --> 02:17:12.580]   She's actually a Sketha on the Twitter.
[02:17:12.580 --> 02:17:13.860]   Thank you so much for being here.
[02:17:13.860 --> 02:17:15.780]   Always a pleasure.
[02:17:15.780 --> 02:17:19.940]   And thank you, my good friend, Mike Elgin for coming up on Super Bowl Sunday.
[02:17:19.940 --> 02:17:20.580]   My pleasure.
[02:17:20.580 --> 02:17:21.860]   Quick plug, Mike's list.
[02:17:21.860 --> 02:17:22.500]   I brought it back.
[02:17:22.500 --> 02:17:23.700]   I've resurrected it.
[02:17:23.700 --> 02:17:24.580]   You're doing it again?
[02:17:24.580 --> 02:17:26.180]   It's bigger and better than ever.
[02:17:26.180 --> 02:17:26.580]   It's free.
[02:17:26.580 --> 02:17:27.140]   It's weekly.
[02:17:27.140 --> 02:17:30.500]   And it's literally the greatest Tech newsletter in the history of mankind.
[02:17:30.500 --> 02:17:31.060]   It is.
[02:17:31.060 --> 02:17:32.260]   Check it out at Elgin.com.
[02:17:32.260 --> 02:17:33.700]   It is literally.
[02:17:33.700 --> 02:17:35.140]   And I'm so glad you're doing it again.
[02:17:35.140 --> 02:17:35.620]   Yeah.
[02:17:35.620 --> 02:17:36.260]   I love it.
[02:17:36.260 --> 02:17:37.060]   Oh, nice.
[02:17:37.060 --> 02:17:37.620]   It's fun.
[02:17:37.620 --> 02:17:40.900]   It's full of good juicy tips and stuff and crazy.
[02:17:40.900 --> 02:17:43.860]   If you like Twit and Philemon you'll actually really like Mike's list.
[02:17:43.860 --> 02:17:44.260]   Yeah.
[02:17:44.260 --> 02:17:45.140]   Nice.
[02:17:45.140 --> 02:17:46.180]   Thank you, Mike.
[02:17:46.180 --> 02:17:47.380]   Thank you all for being here.
[02:17:47.380 --> 02:17:48.340]   We do it normally.
[02:17:48.340 --> 02:17:49.700]   We do it a little bit later in the day.
[02:17:49.700 --> 02:17:55.140]   We did it early today so we get out of here early and watch Justin Timberlake rip off Janet
[02:17:55.140 --> 02:17:56.260]   Jackson's costume.
[02:17:56.260 --> 02:17:58.100]   No, that's not going to happen.
[02:17:58.100 --> 02:17:59.060]   I'm pretty sure of that.
[02:17:59.060 --> 02:18:00.020]   You never know.
[02:18:00.020 --> 02:18:01.060]   You never know.
[02:18:01.060 --> 02:18:04.580]   And he also won't apologize for it either.
[02:18:04.580 --> 02:18:06.180]   So he said I didn't know.
[02:18:06.180 --> 02:18:08.580]   It just was a breakaway bra.
[02:18:08.580 --> 02:18:09.780]   I didn't know.
[02:18:09.780 --> 02:18:13.060]   Team plan to me.
[02:18:13.060 --> 02:18:14.180]   The whole thing seemed planned.
[02:18:14.180 --> 02:18:15.460]   The whole thing was planned.
[02:18:15.460 --> 02:18:16.260]   Of course it was.
[02:18:16.260 --> 02:18:17.460]   We're still talking about it, aren't we?
[02:18:17.460 --> 02:18:21.860]   It took Justin Timberlake, what is it, 15 years to get back on the Super Bowl stage.
[02:18:21.860 --> 02:18:25.700]   We do this show normally 3PM Pacific on Sundays.
[02:18:25.700 --> 02:18:27.780]   That's 6PM Eastern 2300 UTC.
[02:18:27.780 --> 02:18:34.020]   Come on and watch it live at twit.tv/live chat in the chatroom if you do at irc.twit.tv.
[02:18:34.020 --> 02:18:35.140]   You can even join us in studio.
[02:18:35.140 --> 02:18:36.500]   We got a nice studio audience.
[02:18:36.500 --> 02:18:40.180]   All of whom were surprised that the show was already going when you arrived.
[02:18:40.180 --> 02:18:41.060]   I apologize.
[02:18:41.060 --> 02:18:42.180]   Surprise.
[02:18:42.180 --> 02:18:44.340]   I decided to do that at the last minute as usual.
[02:18:44.340 --> 02:18:45.620]   But thank you for being here.
[02:18:45.620 --> 02:18:48.260]   Email tickets@twit.tv will put a seat out for you.
[02:18:48.260 --> 02:18:50.100]   You guys are so cute.
[02:18:50.100 --> 02:18:51.700]   You've been holding hands the whole show.
[02:18:51.700 --> 02:18:53.380]   Are you newlyweds?
[02:18:53.380 --> 02:18:55.380]   You're still in love.
[02:18:55.380 --> 02:18:56.740]   Oh, we're in the crowd.
[02:18:56.740 --> 02:18:56.820]   We're in the crowd.
[02:18:56.820 --> 02:18:57.700]   We're in the show.
[02:18:57.700 --> 02:18:58.020]   Yes.
[02:18:58.020 --> 02:18:58.340]   Yes.
[02:18:58.340 --> 02:18:59.380]   We're in the crowd.
[02:18:59.380 --> 02:19:00.740]   We're in the crowd.
[02:19:00.740 --> 02:19:03.140]   If you want to be here email tickets@twit.tv.
[02:19:03.140 --> 02:19:07.220]   Don't forget our survey is active for a few more days.
[02:19:07.220 --> 02:19:09.860]   This is, we do this once a year to get a better idea of who's watching,
[02:19:09.860 --> 02:19:10.740]   who's listening.
[02:19:10.740 --> 02:19:11.940]   It's very helpful to us.
[02:19:12.820 --> 02:19:14.660]   And it's quick this time just a few questions.
[02:19:14.660 --> 02:19:16.980]   Twit.tv/survey.
[02:19:16.980 --> 02:19:22.980]   We are now heard on the Amazon Echo in new countries, Canada, Australia, India.
[02:19:22.980 --> 02:19:24.420]   I think in the UK.
[02:19:24.420 --> 02:19:28.020]   We're part of the flash briefing.
[02:19:28.020 --> 02:19:32.180]   So if you go to your Echo app and search in flash briefing for Twit,
[02:19:32.180 --> 02:19:32.500]   add it.
[02:19:32.500 --> 02:19:34.340]   We just do a couple of minutes from every show.
[02:19:34.340 --> 02:19:36.340]   Do you do local accents for all of those locations?
[02:19:36.340 --> 02:19:37.060]   I do local Australia.
[02:19:37.060 --> 02:19:37.700]   Indian version.
[02:19:37.700 --> 02:19:38.580]   It's really good.
[02:19:38.580 --> 02:19:40.500]   And no, I don't.
[02:19:40.500 --> 02:19:41.860]   I might. It's time for it.
[02:19:41.860 --> 02:19:42.740]   No, I don't do that.
[02:19:42.740 --> 02:19:43.460]   You don't do that.
[02:19:43.460 --> 02:19:44.180]   You should think about it.
[02:19:44.180 --> 02:19:45.060]   They're all bad, Leo.
[02:19:45.060 --> 02:19:47.460]   They're all bad accents.
[02:19:47.460 --> 02:19:50.820]   Higher local, higher locals to do the localization for you.
[02:19:50.820 --> 02:19:51.540]   We got a deal.
[02:19:51.540 --> 02:19:53.220]   Good tip from Ashley and Sketha.
[02:19:53.220 --> 02:19:54.180]   Absolutely.
[02:19:54.180 --> 02:19:57.060]   But do look for us on your Echo app.
[02:19:57.060 --> 02:20:01.540]   I think you will enjoy the briefings that we prepare for you each day.
[02:20:01.540 --> 02:20:03.060]   Thanks for being here, everybody.
[02:20:03.060 --> 02:20:04.180]   Have a great week.
[02:20:04.180 --> 02:20:05.620]   And we'll see you next time.
[02:20:05.620 --> 02:20:06.260]   Another Twit.
