[00:02:28.620 --> 00:02:30.940]   tech news
[00:02:30.940 --> 00:02:33.780]   And this week a fun panel assembled for you
[00:02:33.780 --> 00:02:40.900]   We decided to to break Alex Lindsay out of the Mac break weekly ranks and bring him into the the big leagues
[00:02:40.900 --> 00:02:46.180]   It's good to see hello to see Alex you know here. Oh nine oh dot media and of course the host of
[00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:48.620]   office hours at office hours dot global
[00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:51.100]   And he's got a hot cup of chai
[00:02:51.100 --> 00:02:55.900]   That they made this weekend. Oh my god. I am just dying
[00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:02.500]   It we it was so much fun like we do you know we do this thing where we cook together over zoom and
[00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:07.220]   Zoom cooking. Yeah, you know you and 90 of your friends cooking
[00:03:07.220 --> 00:03:12.780]   Anyway, it's it's it was it's a great way to learn
[00:03:12.780 --> 00:03:16.060]   I find it hard unless I have some reason to do something to do anything
[00:03:16.260 --> 00:03:20.340]   And so so learning how to it was on my bucket list and so we were able to
[00:03:20.340 --> 00:03:23.780]   Demianti Gajar from South Africa
[00:03:23.780 --> 00:03:28.220]   Indian descent but in South Africa showing us how to make authentic chai
[00:03:28.220 --> 00:03:31.340]   Over zoom and so we put it all we should we got a list
[00:03:31.340 --> 00:03:35.980]   I went out on Friday went shopping came back and on Saturday we went through it together and
[00:03:35.980 --> 00:03:39.060]   And it was the best chive ever had nice
[00:03:39.060 --> 00:03:44.580]   So that's one of the many things that we figure out you know the day before we were talking about Isadora, you know
[00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:49.660]   Which is a an automation program for you know to run theaters. So so it just depends on the day
[00:03:49.660 --> 00:03:56.820]   Also with us from tech republic their editor and chief bill deadweiler good to see you again from Knoxville or Louisville
[00:03:56.820 --> 00:03:58.900]   Louisville
[00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:06.300]   And then you can always tell someone from this area because they sort of slur it all together and don't do the ill part of it
[00:04:06.300 --> 00:04:09.940]   So yeah, just Louisville Louisville home of Derby pie
[00:04:09.940 --> 00:04:13.540]   Indeed forget chai. Give me Derby pie
[00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:17.700]   Indeed although Derby pie is trademark
[00:04:17.700 --> 00:04:22.340]   So now making it yourself or if someone else is making it and you're serving in a restaurant
[00:04:22.340 --> 00:04:27.420]   And you're not the owner of Derby pie. It's usually just like pecan pie with chocolate chips
[00:04:27.420 --> 00:04:33.940]   Which doesn't sound bad at all. I'm gonna call it super bowl pie and see if I can get really sued. There you go
[00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:39.900]   It's great to see you bill also with us from mojale in the Canada
[00:04:40.340 --> 00:04:45.620]   The wonderful Georgia Dow our own personal psychotherapist. Hello, Georgia
[00:04:45.620 --> 00:04:48.740]   Hello, it's great to see you. It's nice to be here
[00:04:48.740 --> 00:04:54.500]   It's been a little while you were you were just telling us about your YouTube channel where you psycho analyze the
[00:04:54.500 --> 00:05:01.740]   Cartoon characters the comic book characters in the suicide squad and you said James Gunn
[00:05:01.740 --> 00:05:05.380]   Said James Gunn what?
[00:05:05.980 --> 00:05:13.020]   He he tweeted me and he tweeted me my channel and said that my analysis on
[00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.460]   Peacemaker from the suicide squad. I'm not it's not a direct quote. I'm probably
[00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:22.980]   smashing but he said but that I was a hundred percent accurate on my
[00:05:22.980 --> 00:05:25.900]   analysis of peacemaker
[00:05:25.900 --> 00:05:30.660]   And said that I was in his head and that
[00:05:30.660 --> 00:05:34.220]   You should watch all the rest of my analysis. Oh my god
[00:05:34.220 --> 00:05:40.140]   You did all of them with my channel. I did I did a whole bunch of I did a lot of them
[00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:44.580]   I think I've done almost everyone it would be hard to do them all because there seemed to be some
[00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:51.160]   Quite a few subsidiary characters in the cracks and so I did do one subsidiary character
[00:05:51.160 --> 00:05:57.780]   I did do weasel. He was my like we have weasel gets like and I don't think it's a spoiler to say this blown away very early on
[00:05:57.780 --> 00:06:02.340]   Well, you have to watch you should probably watch the move you should watch
[00:06:02.340 --> 00:06:08.260]   Finish it up because you might want to finish it up. You can't really psycho analyze a character. That's a weasel
[00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:12.500]   It doesn't even talk. I I I did
[00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:22.420]   But it was funny because someone asked James Gunn after like how how accurate was Georgia for the weasel and James Gunn did not answer
[00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:24.420]   So I'm not sure I got weasel right
[00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:30.020]   But I did do Nanue and the shark and I think I was pretty spot-on
[00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:33.140]   He is my favorite character. I love him. Wow and
[00:06:33.140 --> 00:06:36.500]   Yeah, and so but that was like that was it
[00:06:36.500 --> 00:06:41.100]   It was like that was my like for the past two weeks. I've been kind of living off of that high
[00:06:41.100 --> 00:06:48.020]   Kidn with a director of the movie my next video tanked. I was like and the author of the movie says oh, you got it right
[00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.020]   It's like well. Yeah, thank you
[00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:53.620]   Yeah, like which is like I know I'm good at my job. I know
[00:06:55.660 --> 00:07:02.660]   I have to have them actually say that I am that like good at this one at least I was like it was it was pretty cool
[00:07:02.660 --> 00:07:06.660]   It was really pretty cool. So, you know now James Gunn and I are like this of course
[00:07:06.660 --> 00:07:09.860]   You're good close personal friend of course. Yes
[00:07:09.860 --> 00:07:14.900]   You think call Jimmy Jimmy. Hey Jimmy. We call him Jimmy, you know
[00:07:14.900 --> 00:07:17.540]   It's very casual, you know
[00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:22.740]   Actually, I do want to ask you to psycho analyze a therapist reacts to squid game
[00:07:22.740 --> 00:07:27.900]   But we'll do that and I'll play there on it. I did do I did do one of squid game. Did you watch the whole show?
[00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:34.540]   I did see the whole thing. Holy cow. Did see the whole thing. It's kind of brutal. Wow. All right. It was it was a little
[00:07:34.540 --> 00:07:36.100]   Squiddy squiddy
[00:07:36.100 --> 00:07:39.780]   We'll get your we'll get you take on that, but I guess we probably should start
[00:07:39.780 --> 00:07:43.140]   with the big news of the week which is
[00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:48.660]   This is the this when I went visited my son's fraternity in
[00:07:49.660 --> 00:07:54.600]   Boulder at CU Boulder. He said come on out. We're pre-gaming and I said, oh great
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:08:00.380]   What does that mean you this is like you tailgate before the football game the big football game and then you all go to the
[00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:02.380]   Games and now we don't bother going to the game. We just
[00:08:02.380 --> 00:08:07.980]   Pre-game by the time we've done free gaming really no shape to go to the game
[00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:13.660]   So let's pre-game the big events of the week and it's kind of funny
[00:08:13.660 --> 00:08:17.300]   First it started with Google announcing that on October 19th Tuesday
[00:08:17.780 --> 00:08:19.780]   they were going to
[00:08:19.780 --> 00:08:24.700]   Finally take the wraps off the pixel six of which no secret remains
[00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:28.660]   we know everything there is to know about the pixel six and
[00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:35.260]   At that point I think on Mac break weekly even I think Renee Richie and we all kind of conferred and said well
[00:08:35.260 --> 00:08:39.660]   That means Apple probably won't do it that week, but the following week, but no
[00:08:39.660 --> 00:08:45.420]   Apple said hold my beer and they announced last week that they're gonna do it on Monday the day before and
[00:08:45.700 --> 00:08:49.660]   There I don't know what they're gonna announce, but we think it's probably laptops
[00:08:49.660 --> 00:08:55.100]   And then little Samsung comes running along and I'd love you to psycho analyze this and says wait wait
[00:08:55.100 --> 00:08:57.100]   We're gonna do something on Wednesday
[00:08:57.100 --> 00:09:02.900]   So this week Apple Monday Google Tuesday Samsung Wednesday
[00:09:02.900 --> 00:09:10.180]   You couldn't get a more jam-packed week of announcements. Let's start with the Mondays announcements
[00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:15.220]   We talked about this ad ad nauseam on
[00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:19.860]   on Mac break weekly of course, but it's pretty clear. They're gonna announce a new
[00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:26.780]   Mac book pro a 14 inch a 16 inch and maybe a new Mac mini which I know Alex you're
[00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:32.500]   I'm super excited. Hot and bothered about there is a rumor has just come out
[00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:38.340]   That we might know the names of the chips the only really the question mark really was
[00:09:38.340 --> 00:09:42.580]   Are they gonna be the M1X the M2? What's Apple gonna call them?
[00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:47.340]   They're not gonna be M1s. They're gonna be a successor chip mark german in his power on newsletter
[00:09:47.340 --> 00:09:53.700]   Says a Mac developer informed him that they saw in the app logs chip names
[00:09:53.700 --> 00:10:01.180]   M1 pro and M1 pro max or M1 max. I guess not pro max. That's the phone
[00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:07.740]   So now I guess they're consistent. Yeah, well, we already own it. We already got them
[00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:12.660]   You know we got that we could just do it that makes sense though because it is a pro version of
[00:10:12.660 --> 00:10:19.780]   What we saw earlier, which was what kind of the entry level and I think it may be delineating that there's the chips are gonna be
[00:10:19.780 --> 00:10:22.380]   Very distinct from each other
[00:10:22.380 --> 00:10:26.100]   As opposed to just the same, you know, or relatively the same chipset
[00:10:26.100 --> 00:10:30.860]   We I think it was a little less clear with them the Mac book pros and even with the
[00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:36.660]   With the iPads that there's some subtle differences based on the storage that you got right, you know
[00:10:36.660 --> 00:10:41.260]   In the chipset and so this one would be probably clearer and probably a lot different, you know
[00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:46.740]   Then then the original one so if they're really interested if there is a surprise, you know when the Apple announced the first M1
[00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:52.620]   Systems they all had exactly the same chip and you're right the iPad pro is slightly different
[00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:54.140]   It's called an M1, but it's slightly different
[00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:59.900]   But it's essentially same clock speed on the Mac book pro 13 inch on the Mac book air on the Mac mini
[00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:05.660]   They're they're essentially the same chips and that it's the the package around them that that varies
[00:11:06.100 --> 00:11:10.420]   This sounds like there's gonna be two chips. There's an M1 pro and there's an M1 max
[00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:14.780]   So that's kind of interesting. That's a that is a tidbit. We hadn't anticipated
[00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:21.340]   Yeah, if it happens and it does make sense that it would it would make sense for them to include the iMac and the Mac mini if they're
[00:11:21.340 --> 00:11:25.900]   Upgrading the chips, you know beyond just the so that you would get the more powerful
[00:11:25.900 --> 00:11:33.460]   Laptops, but you would also get more powerful. Do you think they might do a 16 inch MacBook Pro in two flavors and M1
[00:11:34.140 --> 00:11:41.300]   Pro and an M1 max like do they do the phones kind of that way, you know when you buy the the iPhone 13 you get the 13 or you
[00:11:41.300 --> 00:11:46.860]   Get the 13 Pro or you get the 13 Pro max each of those is distinct same process
[00:11:46.860 --> 00:11:52.980]   Hopefully they'll give people the choice between 14 and 16 having either chip and not put the smaller chip on the 14
[00:11:52.980 --> 00:11:55.500]   No, that would be a 16. Yeah, it would be a little bit of a bummer
[00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:58.500]   But yeah, but the but I think that you know I think that the desktop
[00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:02.020]   I think that the timing is really good for the desktops as well because
[00:12:02.460 --> 00:12:07.100]   I was I was really looking at this announcement and see trying to figure out how excited I was and I was like
[00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:10.380]   I really just want more Mac minis like I don't I don't need I don't you know
[00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:14.940]   Because most of us aren't traveling the way we used to like I don't have a need like I have to open up my
[00:12:14.940 --> 00:12:16.460]   I open up my laptop every once in a while
[00:12:16.460 --> 00:12:19.860]   And then it has all these updates that it has to do because I haven't used it for a month
[00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:27.180]   So so it's an it's an interesting it's in different space that that we've been in then what we've been in in the before times Apple pioneered
[00:12:27.180 --> 00:12:32.380]   These all in ones they were the first I think to do the iMacs where the computer
[00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:37.660]   And the display everything was in one piece nice for the living room not a lot of wires
[00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:42.740]   Just kind of clean design, but I wonder if if times have changed
[00:12:42.740 --> 00:12:46.140]   Georgia do you are you still like that iMac?
[00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:49.980]   I mean I've been all in one in front of me right now, but do you I think maybe I'm thinking at home?
[00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:56.820]   I would like more choice in display and this is especially true now where Apple has not doesn't have a display and
[00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:01.100]   And and it and I would like to separate the processor from the display
[00:13:01.100 --> 00:13:07.580]   Do you think maybe that the idea of an all-in-one is is is over over aged over?
[00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:10.180]   I think that it depends on your personality type
[00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:16.020]   I think that some people like things to be kind of simplistic and straightforward and direct and they just
[00:13:16.020 --> 00:13:20.700]   Want to be given what's the best and not really have to think about it and not have to book anything in
[00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:21.140]   Yeah
[00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:24.580]   And so I think that that definitely serves a certain type of person
[00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:29.420]   And then I think that other people want to be able to buy what they want to suit its purpose
[00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:33.660]   And don't mind if there's more wiring or that they can move things around and they can be able to
[00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:37.860]   Upgrade display without having to upgrade all the processing that happens within
[00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:41.340]   So I think that it all depends on your personality type
[00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:47.340]   I think that for Apple like a lot of people would really enjoy being able to
[00:13:47.340 --> 00:13:52.940]   Change the display without changing everything else and you kind of have your setup with that or have like many multiples
[00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:54.500]   Yeah, that's me all kind of hooked up
[00:13:54.500 --> 00:14:01.740]   I have a 55 inch OLED that I'm using for a Windows machine Linux machine, but I would love to go cook up a Mac mini do that
[00:14:01.740 --> 00:14:06.220]   I don't need a display and I think that for me I float my displays a lot
[00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.980]   And so I think that's what I realized is that over the last little bit of time
[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:12.940]   I have you know these arms that cost anywhere from 80 to 250 dollars that
[00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:20.440]   What do you mean Alex? They're literally floating in space. Yeah, so you have a little stand that you can have a stand
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:26.860]   In swing them. Well, yeah, there's an arm with actual flow arm. Okay. Yeah, and so basically they
[00:14:26.860 --> 00:14:32.480]   There's two arms per thing that attached to my table. So I've got like for me
[00:14:32.480 --> 00:14:34.880]   I've got four monitors in addition to the one sorry
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:44.600]   I'm going to show you but for anyway, but I have well
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:48.760]   I have I have maybe more than four monitors, but I move for major monitors and so
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:53.340]   So the camera show us the opposite
[00:14:53.340 --> 00:15:03.060]   I just got to get an adapter for my phone get the jib what you need is the jib bringing the jib and the
[00:15:03.060 --> 00:15:05.600]   It's the inside drone
[00:15:05.600 --> 00:15:11.920]   So yeah, I think actually I don't know what the numbers are cuz Apple doesn't reveal them
[00:15:11.920 --> 00:15:15.800]   But I would guess that the new iMacs at 24 inches sold quite well
[00:15:15.800 --> 00:15:19.000]   And those were definitely not those are consumer products
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.080]   They were they were smaller than the 27 inch iMac they came in colors
[00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:26.600]   They were really some people even said I don't think this is fair
[00:15:26.600 --> 00:15:32.600]   But they're just an iPad on a stand there were very thin simple clean devices
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:37.920]   So maybe yeah, there must be a market for that biller. Are you a fan of the all-in-one?
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:44.360]   You know, I don't like the all-in-one because I'm kind of like Alex and I'm like you actually have a yeah
[00:15:44.360 --> 00:15:47.520]   Well, I have a wide monitor. I have a 50 inch. Yes
[00:15:47.520 --> 00:15:50.240]   Samsung monitor in front of me right now
[00:15:50.240 --> 00:15:55.600]   It's one of the ultra-wide curved monitors and I love it because I can get so much information on it
[00:15:55.600 --> 00:16:00.680]   And so now I will admit I run it off of a 2016 MacBook Pro
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:06.480]   But I don't see an all-in-one for myself, but my daughter loves it
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:12.160]   She's got a 27 inch iMac and she likes simplicity and so in her room
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:16.680]   She uses that and then she just went off to college this year speaking college Leo
[00:16:16.680 --> 00:16:21.000]   And your son it's perfect. She took what did she take with her a MacBook Air?
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.760]   So, you know, she didn't take the iMac because she needed the portability
[00:16:24.760 --> 00:16:28.600]   So, you know, I still like the I still like the variety
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:34.760]   But I'll tell you what I'm most excited about it if the rumors are true and the new MacBook Pros
[00:16:35.400 --> 00:16:40.120]   Go away from the silly things like the touch bar
[00:16:40.120 --> 00:16:42.840]   Bring back mags a
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:45.200]   Bring back an SD card slot
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:50.600]   rid of the USB C charging because I just didn't go back to mags
[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:55.640]   I feel like I said that because the ports just wear out after plugging it in pulling it out plugging it in pulling out so many years
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:17:01.240]   So I'm much more excited about those functional changes as a long-time MacBook Pro
[00:17:01.360 --> 00:17:07.440]   Then I was really sad to see go away, you know with the 2016 redesign so more than the processors
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:13.640]   I like more power. I like more RAM and everything, but I want to see some of those other things come back
[00:17:13.640 --> 00:17:17.000]   I'll tell you what I don't like and this is again. This is rumor
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.720]   But according to Mac rumors
[00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:23.120]   And and the YBO account any turtle
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:25.080]   999
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:30.400]   There will be a notch on the screen of the Mac book Pro
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:36.960]   What I hope that's not true. Oh, that would be so I hate the knot. I am a notch hater
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:39.680]   I'll just say it you're a notch Nazi. I know I
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:47.640]   Would not use those words. Okay. Yeah, you're right very insensitive. Okay, but I do absolutely hate
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:51.520]   The notch so to have like please don't do that
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:55.680]   Don't give me a notch that would be horrifically horrifically bad
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:18:01.280]   It would be to solve the bezel problem because of course, uh, one of the things I think they want to do with this 16
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:04.640]   Inches put it in a in a package is not much bigger than the 14 inch
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:07.800]   But with no bezels the screen goes all the way out to the edge
[00:18:07.800 --> 00:18:09.800]   But then you have this problem with a camera
[00:18:09.800 --> 00:18:16.960]   At the top and it's a notch might be the one thing that the notch does to do when you think about it though when you're talking about
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:23.440]   Like face what we're doing right now the notch brings the camera on to the yeah, yeah
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:26.520]   That's true. So so that's so that's gonna put your face, you know
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:32.920]   That's gonna put your eye line better and it's something that we spend a lot of time thinking about and the way Apple does its operating system
[00:18:32.920 --> 00:18:37.920]   There's a menu bar at the top so just like on a phone the notch would be in the menu bar
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:40.680]   But I often run applications full screen
[00:18:40.680 --> 00:18:44.440]   Overwriting the menu bar and for me that would be a prop
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:50.640]   I would not be happy that even a tiny bit of real estate is taken up. So we'll we'll we'll they'll be controversy Alex
[00:18:50.640 --> 00:18:56.400]   If you set up your your camera, yeah, hold on one second. We're gonna see this. We're gonna see the setup. Yeah, so this is
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:01.560]   It's a little messy. I didn't plan to show. Oh, that's all right. That makes you human
[00:19:01.560 --> 00:19:06.520]   Yeah, so so this is so this is obviously you guys
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:12.360]   What are you running at the same time? Are you running a internet stream?
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:20.000]   No, no, this is that's just what you're looking at zoom and then I have a that's this that's my switcher. Oh my god
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   My audio
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:28.720]   This is the a-tam extreme ISO and this is a sound device is Scorpio
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:31.800]   Which is the most overkill ever for interface for
[00:19:31.800 --> 00:19:37.640]   And then and then there's my it is my synth stuff that I
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:45.880]   Can't stop
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:52.200]   Since is that you just keep going I can I could do I could do so much more if I just had this one
[00:19:52.200 --> 00:19:57.000]   And then I had this one and then you know, just keep on you keep on getting them. So that's how I kind of and then
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   He's Rick Wakeman apparently, okay
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:08.800]   And then these are the Mac minis and I got these little things that that pop these out and that runs these two screens
[00:20:08.800 --> 00:20:11.320]   So these are a little extension boxes
[00:20:11.320 --> 00:20:14.040]   It's that and then there's another Mac mini that does my telestrator stuff
[00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:18.640]   And then and then this will split and then this this is a this is an HDMI router. So I can reroute
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:24.520]   signals around sure of course. So anyway, that's that's kind of the how it looks
[00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:30.260]   And that's really that's we need a whole show just on your setup. I've never seen I do a whole show
[00:20:30.260 --> 00:20:32.840]   It's every morning is called it's called office hours
[00:20:32.840 --> 00:20:41.360]   My kid my kid is kind of middle of the road for office hours like this what I just showed you is like a compared
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.360]   Everybody else on the show
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:47.840]   Really? Yes, and because not everybody watches Mac break weekly
[00:20:47.840 --> 00:20:53.520]   Mash potato is saying is that a rum's leg action figure on the it is
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:57.000]   It is. Yeah, this is rum's leg. I
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:04.680]   Actually played a rum's leg in episode one. So I so it was I didn't realize
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:11.640]   Did you just wear the no no I had I had things that look like I'm talking it does look if you actually watch it
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:13.120]   I am
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:17.600]   Looking like I'm talking to someone else. So it looks like I'm kind of insane and talking to myself
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:21.720]   There was someone else there that got wrote it out, but when I when I finished the
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:27.560]   So I was I'm in it. It's right when the camera droid float flies through my size Lee. You'll see this this guy
[00:21:27.560 --> 00:21:34.240]   Want you know wandering through and that was me back then what would happen at ILM is someone would just walk over for extras and go
[00:21:34.240 --> 00:21:39.160]   I need you you and you and then we get up and get in get in something signed something something
[00:21:39.240 --> 00:21:45.320]   Signing away and then go and do the shoot and so I was rum's leg at least for one one instance of it
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:49.880]   I think there's another one where he's like in the crowd somewhere that I wasn't is it entirely a green screen set or
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:51.880]   It was when I was in front of it
[00:21:51.880 --> 00:21:57.000]   It was just a green screen that they come practicals at all and no practicals at all and and then when I took the pictures
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.480]   When I took the pictures after the after I did the thing they said okay
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:04.720]   You need to do a T-pose which is you put your arms out like this and then you do a couple of things
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:07.240]   I said what is the T-pose for and they're like it's for the action figure
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:13.000]   They're gonna make an action figure of me and they're like they said they were like they were like so
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.560]   so the thing is is that so then I was like so excited doesn't have my own action figure and
[00:22:17.560 --> 00:22:20.120]   but it was on the like the third tier of
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:26.040]   Action figures and so the first two have to do well and they didn't do as well as they needed to so nothing happened
[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:32.280]   And then what I found out only a couple years ago maybe a year ago is that that in the 10th anniversary
[00:22:32.680 --> 00:22:37.880]   They they actually released rum's leg as an action figure so so then I got excited
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:38.960]   I bought an action
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:42.120]   I bought a rum's leg action figure because this is you know someday
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:46.760]   I'm gonna go to Halloween, you know, I want to go to an Halloween party as rum's leg, but
[00:22:46.760 --> 00:22:52.400]   He is like what are you talking about? I exactly you're not playing like you are
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:56.160]   He was he a bounty hunter he was a bounty hunter
[00:22:56.160 --> 00:22:58.120]   Okay, and so it's kind of and well
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.640]   We've been we've been joking that if we ever do do like a short
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:04.360]   We should do rum's leg like kind of like the Mandalorian, but it's a rum's leg
[00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:07.080]   I think they should bring room so we just like he'll be
[00:23:07.080 --> 00:23:13.920]   He'll be just like he'll be just like Mandalorian except he won't he won't shoot very well and it'd be kind of an alcoholic and screws up a lot of
[00:23:13.920 --> 00:23:19.680]   It's more like it's kind of like if Jar Jar and and Boba Fett had a baby
[00:23:19.680 --> 00:23:24.840]   It would be like rum's leg, you know, like it was you know a lot of a lot of things falling apart a horrible visual
[00:23:28.720 --> 00:23:34.720]   Now I can't get that out of my head. Thank you. Allie. That's my pleasure. I like it
[00:23:34.720 --> 00:23:37.440]   Maybe like a five o'clock shadow and yeah
[00:23:37.440 --> 00:23:45.560]   He always wins but it's always by accident like he backs into the thing that that does the thing any any
[00:23:45.560 --> 00:23:52.240]   Accidentally drops something on a handle that blows up the the bad guy, but it's never it's never like he's not he's not great
[00:23:52.240 --> 00:23:58.240]   He's just he's just lucky rum's leg a Star Wars story coming soon to Disney Plus
[00:23:58.720 --> 00:24:04.920]   I think that sounds good by the rum's leg better better than average by accident by accident. I love it
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:10.280]   That's you already got a great backstory. I'm sure we're gonna do a therapist reacts to rum's leg at some point
[00:24:10.280 --> 00:24:14.640]   Yeah, exactly actually the the chatroom demanded Georgia dad a
[00:24:14.640 --> 00:24:18.360]   Therapist reacts to Alex's home office
[00:24:24.360 --> 00:24:29.800]   It fair it is that this is actually a cut down version of what I used to we used to call it the array because I've been building this
[00:24:29.800 --> 00:24:31.640]   frame for 10 for
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:34.720]   Over 10 years, you know because I started doing classes in Rwanda
[00:24:34.720 --> 00:24:37.800]   from my house when I was in Petaluma and
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:42.560]   So I needed to have all this stuff to teach the classes is why I thought I needed it anyway
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:45.200]   And so so I had bigger switchers and more monitors
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:50.400]   And I've slowly called it down to what I think I need to actually do do what I do but but yeah
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:55.120]   So it's so I've been doing it a lot longer than everyone else. I've kind of burrowed in a little bit more than most
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:25:03.800]   One thing in our discord or club twit discord orange guy in there says what if the notch on the laptop means face ID?
[00:25:03.800 --> 00:25:08.520]   That's I would love to have face ID in the laptop. Yeah, great Microsoft's
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:13.400]   Does that of course windows hello? They call it or or either or or both
[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:17.280]   They mean really good on a security perspective to say I want to use my thing. Yes
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:20.000]   I want to use my fingerprints or I want to use my face ID or
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:26.400]   I want to do both I want to have you know like someone who wants to really secure their laptop might be I want to factor and
[00:25:26.400 --> 00:25:30.640]   My fingerprint in my face like I need all of those things where I don't want you to open up
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:37.240]   That's really good. So those it really has to be me just in case they cut off your finger right or wear a mask
[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:41.840]   They have to have the mask and then they have to have then they'd have to have your phone a lot of things
[00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:45.320]   Could they use could you use a rums like action figure for face ID? I wonder
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:47.960]   That would really that would really
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:50.680]   The eyes move yeah, exactly
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:54.560]   Really still he does not work
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:26:05.280]   I really really keep your eyes completely like dead. It does not open don't think I'm saying link
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:13.280]   Where have I seen that something says link didn't do it. It seems like a reasonably smart way to do that
[00:26:13.280 --> 00:26:15.960]   You know to make sure that you're not using a mask
[00:26:16.680 --> 00:26:18.680]   Yeah, yeah
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:24.320]   Limiting for the camera though and then center of the screen. That's what I want you were talking about this earlier Alex
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:30.040]   Which is you know moving the notch down or the screen closer to notch puts it closer to your eye line
[00:26:30.040 --> 00:26:34.680]   But like I'm looking at a camera that's at least four inches above my monitor
[00:26:34.680 --> 00:26:36.680]   And I would rather have it right in the center
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:42.800]   So you can actually sort of look at the face of the person you're talking to on a zoom call without trying to rig up some
[00:26:43.520 --> 00:26:49.400]   Proctor setup or another kind of you know external display. So that's really what I want in the next Macbook Pro
[00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:53.480]   But don't think I think that I think it's hard to argue to put that in the Mac Pro
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:55.920]   I do think that there's a market for monitors that would do that
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:57.320]   You know that they just say hey
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:01.280]   We're gonna knock a couple pixels out and put a webcam the problem really is is that you have to put it
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:07.120]   If you're gonna commit to that you have to put a really high quality webcam in there in the only company that seems to be good at webcam
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:10.720]   quality for the actual cameras logitech everyone else seems to
[00:27:11.120 --> 00:27:18.280]   They try but we test them all and we test every webcam that gets released and there are under screen cameras in fact
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:21.360]   a number of smartphones from Oppo's most recently
[00:27:21.360 --> 00:27:27.520]   Xiaomi's ax or ZT's axon does it show me does it the quality of the video
[00:27:27.520 --> 00:27:29.960]   That's great not been great. That's the problem
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:32.760]   Yeah, you really give up a lot because it's filtering it's filtering it out
[00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:38.440]   So you know also these are all leads which may be easier to do than with mini LED
[00:27:39.120 --> 00:27:44.800]   Technology OLEDs don't have the you know mini LED you got to have a backlight and layer and OLED is direct for you
[00:27:44.800 --> 00:27:48.000]   So it may not be you can't even do it without an OLED screen, so
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:50.960]   But I agree I agree Bill that would be really
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:57.040]   Gotta they gotta solve this they sort of solve it Apple sort of solves it with their
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:59.680]   zooming capability
[00:27:59.680 --> 00:28:01.680]   when you're using on
[00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:05.120]   iPad Pro or I think the mini now does it
[00:28:05.120 --> 00:28:08.400]   FaceTime and other apps if they're
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:14.520]   Properly configured will zoom as you move around and yeah the hard part is is the hard part really is the icon
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:17.080]   I like you know the eye contact is super important
[00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:23.200]   One of the things that we started we've done a lot of insert studio work and the big thing with insert studio work is that
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:31.760]   Usually there's no return video so the video doesn't come back to the person because the broadcasters are too cheap to do that because that would cause money
[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:36.280]   And so so they just get you're when you're watching CNN or Fox or whatever
[00:28:36.440 --> 00:28:41.200]   There's they have an in ear they're listening to the conversation and as you know the other just looking straight at the camera
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:45.200]   You know and what we what we learned when we started doing lots of and what we call in
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:51.080]   Teratron which is putting the video into a teleprompter is that people's eyes and their facial
[00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:58.560]   Expressions are different when they can see the other people that they're talking to so literally their eyes converge slightly differently
[00:28:58.560 --> 00:29:04.320]   And then they do this funny thing where they mirror people and then they and they change what they're talking about because if someone puts their
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:08.720]   Put something puts their eyebrows up or down or nods a lot or looks looks
[00:29:08.720 --> 00:29:14.560]   Concerned all those things bring out an entirely different person, you know from the person on the other side
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:19.920]   And so it becomes it's not just it's not just a little inconvenient
[00:29:19.920 --> 00:29:22.320]   So a lot of us are moving toward like I'm getting a new teleprompter
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:25.880]   I my camera is right above it because I had a smaller teleprompter and I didn't like it
[00:29:25.880 --> 00:29:27.880]   You want to look right through it. Yeah, yeah
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:34.040]   I want to look right at people and it and it and it's and we have a lot of people on we have about half of
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:41.000]   Office hours has on teleprompters and so so you see you know you see the tittings every all on prompter about half of them
[00:29:41.000 --> 00:29:42.840]   Are they reading stuff?
[00:29:42.840 --> 00:29:47.820]   No, no, they're just talking they just have a proper is just there so that we can talk to each other directly through the through the
[00:29:47.820 --> 00:29:52.640]   Glads you're on the prompter. Oh, that's interesting. Yeah, that's the that's what we call in
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:54.920]   Teratron. Oh
[00:29:54.920 --> 00:30:00.920]   Something heir of that if you look at like into the void or fog of war from aramora's yeah
[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:07.560]   He does that and so we started doing it in the I mean, you know 10 years ago or more with
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:10.200]   interviews, but now we do it
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:16.960]   We've been doing it a lot for this kind of thing and it really makes a huge difference in in how people look because that direct eye
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:21.560]   Eye contact is great and it does make a difference like it. It's something that
[00:30:21.560 --> 00:30:26.280]   Is worth doing and so we've been I put it off because I again
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:28.520]   I had it for a little while and I took it out because my my
[00:30:28.920 --> 00:30:33.480]   Teleprompter itself was just too small to do everything I wanted to do but now I'm putting a 24 back in
[00:30:33.480 --> 00:30:39.240]   To because it I think I just made it just I just noticed how much of a difference it makes when I'm looking straight into the
[00:30:39.240 --> 00:30:43.560]   Into the camera you said the word. It's interesting because we actually that's where they're on Morris
[00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:48.920]   Yeah, yeah, he called it that I we you know, it's not a good name. It sounds like you're well
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:53.960]   It's hearing somebody but he he has it like he invented it now in office hours
[00:30:53.960 --> 00:30:56.460]   We have the person who actually invented the digital in
[00:30:57.080 --> 00:31:02.440]   Teleprompter so so he Courtney and and so he he's like well. He didn't invent it
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:06.280]   I mean people were doing it in the 80s. It's just it's just that he's the one that popularized it
[00:31:06.280 --> 00:31:11.960]   So oh interesting putting video and putting putting the video back into the thing has is really
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:16.840]   Useful and you know, we built them at all different sizes. I think the the largest one we built I think was
[00:31:16.840 --> 00:31:19.080]   70 inches
[00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:21.080]   a 70-inch teleprompter, which was
[00:31:21.080 --> 00:31:23.560]   a little scary
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:28.440]   In a lot of ways where we actually have a part of the brain that that fires that that we have neurons that
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:33.320]   Like there's there's parts of the brain that actually fire for two dots in a like a face shape
[00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:38.680]   And it only fires for that and since most of the way that we engage with people is about
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:41.400]   We're constantly reading
[00:31:41.400 --> 00:31:47.240]   Unconsciously all of the different micro expressions that people deal with so if someone moves back Alex as you were saying
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:51.080]   They move back or their eyebrows rays or they come forward. It's totally different. I do
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:58.360]   Like you know interviews sometimes on like like big network shows and sometimes I don't see the other person that I'm talking
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:01.560]   Yeah
[00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:07.320]   I hate that because in my head. I'm going. Am I talking too long? Have I been too loud? Do they hate this?
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:08.840]   Are they giving me the cues?
[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:14.200]   Hurry up or continue on I have no clue and so because of that I'm just
[00:32:14.200 --> 00:32:17.880]   Hoping that I'm reading the nothing because
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:24.760]   Really good with most network most people most punnets appear on networks don't care about any of that stuff. They just
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:29.400]   They might lean more towards narcissism
[00:32:29.400 --> 00:32:34.600]   So it's all about them anyway, talking enough. That's not a question that comes up
[00:32:34.600 --> 00:32:40.120]   Talking to my super feeler. I care you care. That's what's good about you
[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:44.520]   So when I first heard about aromores's technique, I thought you're just weird
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:51.080]   But now that you've explained it I understand it's not just weird because he wouldn't even be in the room sometimes with the person he's interviewing
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:55.640]   Yeah, well, and a lot of times he was in the room and curtained away and that's how we started
[00:32:55.640 --> 00:33:00.600]   But we actually found it was funny. We had a client. Well, you don't want a person looking over at you
[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:05.640]   You want him looking? No, you put curtains you put curtains in between yeah, and then and with the way he did it
[00:33:05.640 --> 00:33:08.680]   He didn't run like an IFB or a microphone
[00:33:08.680 --> 00:33:13.080]   He just talked loud in the room and you could hear him talking but you're looking at him there
[00:33:13.560 --> 00:33:16.840]   What we changed was creating an environment where
[00:33:16.840 --> 00:33:22.520]   The person is always in some other room or some other state or some other country and we started doing this with
[00:33:22.520 --> 00:33:25.400]   The other place that we've done this is point-to-points where we put
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:28.200]   an executive in another country
[00:33:28.200 --> 00:33:35.080]   So there's like, you know, they have to talk in Singapore or Morocco and they don't want to spend four days if you're a studio for a four to one hundred company
[00:33:35.080 --> 00:33:38.840]   You don't want to you know and so and that one is interesting because
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:41.320]   For them it was really good to look into it
[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:44.280]   But we found that if we actually put them on it or right below the camera
[00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:49.400]   It would drop their eyes down below the camera and if you're in the room it is it's like
[00:33:49.400 --> 00:33:53.960]   Wizard of Oz like it is this huge head looking right at you because you're
[00:33:53.960 --> 00:34:00.520]   We actually wanted to drive that eyeline just a little below the camera to see the audience. Oh, I thought you wanted to make them look humble
[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:02.600]   Okay, never mind now. It looks like
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:09.080]   That's like the 1984 that it's like 1984 ad that did sound creepy. Yeah, it was arresting
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:11.640]   Like when you're in the room, it was super powerful
[00:34:11.640 --> 00:34:14.680]   But it really felt like it was they're looking at you like when you ask a question
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:18.200]   They like look over and we had the camera set up so they'd long over like this
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:24.520]   All the great and so I wonder if uh one of the reasons this works
[00:34:24.520 --> 00:34:27.960]   Georgia is because your interview subject isn't
[00:34:27.960 --> 00:34:33.880]   Talking directly to you. They're talking to an image of you. Do you think maybe they feel a little more free?
[00:34:33.880 --> 00:34:38.440]   To to self-expectives very it's an odd it seems like a
[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:43.400]   Very artificial environment nowadays we're used to it. This is how you and I are interacting
[00:34:43.400 --> 00:34:46.920]   We're you know, we're you're in montreal. I'm in california
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:51.480]   I'm looking at a picture of you. You're going to picture me, but uh at the time
[00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:54.680]   Imagine, you know, you're doing an interview the fog of war
[00:34:54.680 --> 00:34:59.160]   Your robert magnum era talking about this. Why is the guy behind a curtain?
[00:34:59.160 --> 00:35:03.640]   Does it give him more freedom to be candid you think?
[00:35:04.360 --> 00:35:09.960]   Sometimes we do that even in therapy. Um certain therapists will be behind the person. Oh, that's right
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:16.120]   They're dealing with therapy. They're not actually there so that the person can kind of be really free like I do certain
[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:21.880]   Exercises with people that I will turn off my camera and I'll turn off my mic since most of my sessions now are still
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:26.840]   Over zoom so that they can be alone with their thoughts and I'm there, but I'm not specifically
[00:35:26.840 --> 00:35:34.280]   The classic fridayin therapy where you're lying on a couch and the therapist is behind you and you're just walking into the air
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:39.240]   I do and you get a little bit more of a free thought because you're not reading
[00:35:39.240 --> 00:35:42.040]   You're not in their head of there. Are they questioning me?
[00:35:42.040 --> 00:35:44.520]   What are they doing and as you kind of free speak?
[00:35:44.520 --> 00:35:50.360]   You can kind of go wherever you want to without that interaction and so sometimes I would use it as a technique
[00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:52.440]   Which I could see that that would be a benefit
[00:35:52.440 --> 00:35:59.400]   And then in other cases people might feel very uncomfortable with that because they might have more social anxiety and they're worried about being judged
[00:35:59.400 --> 00:36:04.200]   And so they'll be in their head constantly saying what did you think of that and that might stop them?
[00:36:04.520 --> 00:36:08.600]   The the chatroom's telling me the radio has terry gross who does npers fresh air
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:14.040]   Never is in the studio with her audience by intent because she says it's an audio interview
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:19.320]   I don't want them to have any body language or anything that's not transmitted through the audio
[00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:22.360]   Uh, so I don't want them to see me and I don't want to see them
[00:36:22.360 --> 00:36:27.400]   Because I only want to have well, she's also not looking at the most of the time. She's looking at her next question, right?
[00:36:27.400 --> 00:36:31.080]   So here's a picture
[00:36:31.080 --> 00:36:34.680]   I wrote a picture of Errol Morris. This is what it looks like to be the subject
[00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:39.640]   This is terrifying. Well, and this is this is the way it started
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:43.640]   You know like this is that that that's how yours looks like, you know 20 years ago or whatever
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:48.680]   But ours is just a you know like that, you know 20 or 30 years ago that so he when he got started with it
[00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:51.880]   That's what it looked like and and his is pretty rough ours is you know
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:56.280]   We've got digital film cameras that are looking at each other and and it's and and I think that it is
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:37:02.360]   One of the things we think about a lot when it comes to zoom sessions and so and so forth is cognitive load
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:07.480]   You know and so what is the cognitive because we can we run 24/7. There's a lot of literally have
[00:37:07.480 --> 00:37:09.080]   There is a lot of
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:14.920]   But but but that fatigue I think a lot of times comes from bad video bad audio is you're kind of listening for people
[00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:18.760]   You're kind of looking through that process. You're not and people aren't really looking at you
[00:37:18.760 --> 00:37:22.120]   All those things are things that that that each one not
[00:37:23.560 --> 00:37:30.360]   There's no one of those that causes a problem, but but as a as a load they they over time take a lot out of you
[00:37:30.360 --> 00:37:36.360]   You know and so so what we find is that as we reduce that cognitive load by by reducing making it more comfortable
[00:37:36.360 --> 00:37:39.960]   You're talking to people they you're better lit you sound better. You look better
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:43.800]   You know in that whole process and you're having that that more fluid conversation
[00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:48.440]   That that load reduces and you can do it for a lot longer and we do it. You know again. We do it for
[00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:51.480]   At least three hours a day
[00:37:52.440 --> 00:37:57.480]   You know so so it does make a difference just to have the thing have to sort those things. It's it's actually really
[00:37:57.480 --> 00:38:00.440]   invigorating
[00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:03.800]   You come out of it because we've been thinking about stuff all day
[00:38:03.800 --> 00:38:07.080]   I mean because it's you know, you're hanging out with 200 people a day every morning and you're
[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:09.560]   Talking about ideas and
[00:38:09.560 --> 00:38:15.480]   Depends upon your personality type right like depending on how like extroverts are like feed off of people's energy
[00:38:15.480 --> 00:38:19.240]   And then you gain more energy through the day and enjoy that and if you're more introverted
[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:25.480]   Being with a lot of people all the time exhausts you and then you need a break where you get to shut down and kind of
[00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:31.720]   Um, you know reenergize depending upon where you are. Um, I think there's another thing that causes
[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:33.640]   Yeah
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:35.480]   I'll just say because i'm i'm a horrible introvert
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:42.920]   Like I just don't like being around people like I I mean I I do like being around people in very small
[00:38:42.920 --> 00:38:46.680]   And I like being around us is what you're saying. I yeah, I like being around where's you guys
[00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:51.480]   Well, I like being around people that I have some reason to be around or that I enjoy being around
[00:38:51.480 --> 00:38:56.600]   I I don't like big crowds very often. I usually I'm kind of notorious for avoiding them and so
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:39:02.760]   Um, and so anyway, so the so this is I have to admit the zoom environment's kind of perfect for me
[00:39:02.760 --> 00:39:06.680]   Because I can make turn it on and off I can turn it on and off as needed
[00:39:06.680 --> 00:39:07.880]   You like are
[00:39:07.880 --> 00:39:10.760]   But you wanted to get a word in. I'm sorry. You just got to know
[00:39:10.760 --> 00:39:13.080]   Yourself in the conversation. I'm
[00:39:14.920 --> 00:39:21.640]   In the in the um in the in the age of remote work when everybody suddenly sort of goes to zoom and goes to video meetings
[00:39:21.640 --> 00:39:25.320]   One of the things that I've found is really interesting is that you know, I think
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:27.880]   Um, I've been on camera for
[00:39:27.880 --> 00:39:33.560]   Decades now and I'm a little bit of a ham and I don't mind the performative aspect, but I'd be interested to hear
[00:39:33.560 --> 00:39:40.840]   Um, you know, george's take and Alex's take too because you know, I think that that performative part of it is also draining
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:47.880]   So if you feel like especially in the early days of the pandemic when everybody was doing zoom meetings for everything and nobody was
[00:39:47.880 --> 00:39:53.800]   Doing face-to-face meetings. There was that extra level of energy that you were uh spending because you felt like
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:59.960]   Uh, you had to be on camera and people had to act a certain way and it was just a different energy
[00:39:59.960 --> 00:40:03.800]   And so I don't know if that it really didn't bother me because I'm kind of used to it
[00:40:03.800 --> 00:40:10.520]   But I saw that on my team and I saw that in people that I was interviewing for my show dynamic developer on tech republic or for other
[00:40:10.520 --> 00:40:13.000]   interviews, you know, there was just this kind of
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:18.200]   Unused to being on camera all the time and feeling like you still had to perform when you were on camera
[00:40:18.200 --> 00:40:26.280]   Even if it's just a face-time call or a zoom call with a colleague that you're trying to substitute a water cooler or a hallway conversation for
[00:40:26.280 --> 00:40:32.360]   So, you know, not to completely derail the show, but you know, I'm really interested to hear what uh george and Alex think about that
[00:40:32.360 --> 00:40:35.400]   Georgia
[00:40:35.400 --> 00:40:42.680]   So I like this is what I do for like I'm with people and and uh having to be you know
[00:40:42.680 --> 00:40:47.640]   Someone that's there a support. So I'm kind of used to being able to be that plus i've done
[00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:50.600]   Technology shows and podcasts and stuff for a really long time
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:57.880]   I'm though like very high on the extra versions that like truly not just on camera. So I'm pretty similar to met me
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:02.440]   Non-in-camera. I would be very similar to that. I think though that
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.720]   um having to constantly put out a certain set of things is
[00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:12.920]   Exhausting at a certain point and it is nice to be able to take some time off from that
[00:41:12.920 --> 00:41:16.520]   I think that the hardest thing for me because I'm also like a caretaker
[00:41:16.520 --> 00:41:21.160]   Like I worry about making other people feel bad or saying the wrong thing or insulting people
[00:41:21.160 --> 00:41:28.280]   Because of that like the delay that happens and it's just a fraction like now people if most people's internet connection
[00:41:28.360 --> 00:41:31.560]   Are so good that it really is just a fraction but even on the show here
[00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:36.840]   We sometimes step on each other's feet because I started talking when someone else talked and then we speak upon each other
[00:41:36.840 --> 00:41:43.000]   That doesn't happen when we can see everyone and it's very clear because usually when someone wants to talk
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.520]   There's like a little tiny like thing of like I'd like to speak next
[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:49.800]   And we're missing a lot of that because when it's on me
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:53.800]   It's just on me so I don't see that Alex is really interested and wants to kind of you know
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:56.680]   Does that little tiny lean forward? I'd like to say something
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:42:01.800]   And so that's the piece that I think it's fine. I find that that costs me a certain amount
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:06.920]   Whereas usually I could be on camera and it probably wouldn't bother me a great deal
[00:42:06.920 --> 00:42:11.720]   Though I do find that phone calls are less of an emotional cost that cognitive loan is less
[00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:16.600]   But also that emotional load is less because I can drink or I can scratch my face
[00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:21.800]   Or you know if I feel an itch I don't have to worry about not doing that and it's going to look really horrible
[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:23.880]   If I scratch my eye right now
[00:42:23.880 --> 00:42:26.280]   Alex
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:28.280]   Well done
[00:42:28.280 --> 00:42:30.280]   I you picked up the queue
[00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:34.680]   I mean, I think that that all of this has a load to it when we when we think about
[00:42:34.680 --> 00:42:38.520]   Going to a meeting and you know what we were doing before it was going to conference room
[00:42:38.520 --> 00:42:41.880]   So now I have to drive down. I have to go into the meeting. I have to dress up a certain way
[00:42:41.880 --> 00:42:44.760]   I have to you know, um, I have to put on whatever
[00:42:44.760 --> 00:42:48.600]   Like, you know, like my
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:51.240]   I'm always wearing sorry
[00:42:51.240 --> 00:42:53.240]   I have uh
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:57.960]   No, but my my general state is you know, like I I had a meeting with with someone in DC
[00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:03.880]   Then I had french cuffs and a and a jacket and a tie and everything else and cargo pants
[00:43:03.880 --> 00:43:07.560]   I go cargo shorts and barefoot and I was like, this is the best
[00:43:07.560 --> 00:43:11.720]   You know, like, you know and and you know because as soon as I you know what's gonna happen as soon as I finish that meeting
[00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:15.560]   I'm gonna take that monkey suit off and I'm gonna put my flannel back on and go back to what I was doing
[00:43:15.560 --> 00:43:17.080]   And so the ability for me
[00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:22.920]   I guess the thing is there's everything has a give and take right and so so there are advantages and disadvantages
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:26.360]   For someone like me, there's more advantages than there are disadvantages
[00:43:26.360 --> 00:43:32.280]   I can definitely see, you know, people who don't feel that way that they they really grooved with what they had
[00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:37.800]   But for someone like me the the ability that I can go to my own kitchen and make my own meals when I want to I can
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:40.680]   I can see my wife, you know, we both work at home
[00:43:40.680 --> 00:43:44.920]   So I get to you know go over and say hi and talk about things a little bit for you know, and in a break
[00:43:44.920 --> 00:43:51.560]   I can wear whatever I want from from the you know from my uh, my chest down
[00:43:52.200 --> 00:43:55.800]   Like this is pretty much whatever I want to wear. I have a very controlled environment
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:44:00.200]   I'm always well lit. I always have I always sound good. I don't have that in the real world
[00:44:00.200 --> 00:44:03.160]   I mean sometimes I'm not well lit and sometimes I don't have good audio and I have a
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:07.480]   Telestrator usually that I can use and I multiple computers that I can jump to and I have you know
[00:44:07.480 --> 00:44:10.040]   And I can jump between things very quickly and
[00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:15.080]   So I think that for me the control that I have over how I interact with people now
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:20.360]   I do think what I will say is tiring is people with bad audio, you know bad audio and bad video
[00:44:20.760 --> 00:44:25.400]   So like I find I I literally you see these conferences and people put up virtual backgrounds
[00:44:25.400 --> 00:44:27.800]   I literally won't go. Oh, I just I
[00:44:27.800 --> 00:44:30.120]   See a virtual background. I'm like, I'm gone
[00:44:30.120 --> 00:44:36.680]   Because that that that virtual background upsets my mind so much that I can't I can't even look at it
[00:44:36.680 --> 00:44:40.600]   I can't and I'll listen to it sometimes sometimes I'll put it on some other monitor and I'll listen to it
[00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:46.040]   I literally can't look at a virtual background because of all the edges constantly changing in their their glasses coming in and out
[00:44:46.040 --> 00:44:50.680]   When they move their hands they disappear and and I feel like that creates a huge cognitive load for me
[00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:56.600]   You know that that I'm constantly trying to ignore that that is so weird, you know and and so I think that um
[00:44:56.600 --> 00:45:01.800]   So I I I think that this there's things that people do in zoom that make it
[00:45:01.800 --> 00:45:06.840]   Horrible when it's done. Well, you know, we again we have for 21 hours a day
[00:45:06.840 --> 00:45:13.240]   There's what we call after hours and it's the ultimate open office where there's 30 to 50 people in there and most of the cameras are off
[00:45:13.240 --> 00:45:16.040]   But if you walk in and go hey, I'm trying to figure out it today
[00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:20.520]   I was like I literally walked in I said I don't understand how to change the volume on this little road
[00:45:20.760 --> 00:45:26.120]   Wireless go or whatever someone immediately turned on the camera and said oh there's a little button at the bottom that you just pushed the thing
[00:45:26.120 --> 00:45:28.600]   I went back to what I was doing, you know, I did so
[00:45:28.600 --> 00:45:34.680]   Look at the human series. That's what you've done. Well, we just we don't who needs them annual now
[00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:38.440]   Just ask a question and and and so or google like, you know
[00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:39.880]   Like instead of googling we just ask it
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:45.880]   But the point is is that the reason a lot of that works is that so many of us take take our audio or internet
[00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:48.840]   Are you know because like the little thing that you know when you're on Wi-Fi?
[00:45:49.400 --> 00:45:53.400]   You break up you have these micro stalls all the time and as you know
[00:45:53.400 --> 00:45:57.320]   Leo, I mean, that's one of the first things we ask people to do is turn their Wi-Fi off and
[00:45:57.320 --> 00:46:03.160]   Uh, I think that that all of these things the bad audio the bad video the things that aren't working
[00:46:03.160 --> 00:46:10.120]   Create make make you tired, you know, because I know that when I used to be on like conference calls with people in conference rooms
[00:46:10.120 --> 00:46:13.320]   I literally would have to lie down when I was done like it was so much
[00:46:13.320 --> 00:46:19.000]   It was like I was like because I could you spent the whole time trying to not think about what they were saying but try to figure out what they were saying
[00:46:19.320 --> 00:46:22.920]   You know and and I think that you know, so a lot of this has been
[00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:29.880]   A long time in coming. I guess in my opinion. It's interesting as we adapt to a new world
[00:46:29.880 --> 00:46:39.080]   Uh, it's I have always thought that there are people who are good with change and people who are not good with change and we're in such a
[00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:42.120]   technologically
[00:46:42.120 --> 00:46:46.200]   Speedy change which the pandemic has even sped up even more
[00:46:46.680 --> 00:46:50.920]   There are just some people who are left basically left by the roadside roadkill
[00:46:50.920 --> 00:46:57.320]   In this new world and then there are people who are fortunate who are good with change or can adapt who do well
[00:46:57.320 --> 00:47:02.360]   But I I do feel like this is not necessarily a beneficial
[00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:07.000]   Thing we're not biologically designed to be using zoom calls all day
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:13.480]   Then I really wonder if the people are losing by the wayside people who just can't adapt to it
[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:15.480]   And I think that that's more than half
[00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:20.360]   If we're gonna lose some important, but I think that I mean in every we've been trying to connect with each other
[00:47:20.360 --> 00:47:26.600]   You know, I mean we've been trying to talk to each other and talk to each other and talk to each other. That's what we're maybe
[00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:33.880]   Maybe I think that I think that I think though that we're made to to interact the big thing that this virtual world has provided for
[00:47:33.880 --> 00:47:36.440]   is we can now
[00:47:36.440 --> 00:47:41.480]   Relatively seamlessly interconnect with people around the world that are that share our interests and our in our approach to things
[00:47:42.040 --> 00:47:45.320]   Without being constrained by geography, you know, and so like
[00:47:45.320 --> 00:47:51.800]   Benefits there's certainly benefits, but but I think there might also be consequences that there's always consequences
[00:47:51.800 --> 00:47:58.520]   Everything is nothing is is without cost, you know, and so it's just a matter of defining which is whether it's cost positive, you know
[00:47:58.520 --> 00:48:00.520]   It's well, there's nobody making that choice
[00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:04.920]   It's not like somebody sat down and did the cost benefit analysis and said let's do zoom
[00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:11.640]   We just we're stuck with it. This is it. I mean the reality is is that it's going to take over like it's right
[00:48:11.640 --> 00:48:17.960]   Like there's not well, it's and I honestly if I could do these shows with everybody sitting around the table
[00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:21.800]   It would be the shows are better the experiences better. It's better for everybody
[00:48:21.800 --> 00:48:27.800]   It's much more fun doing it in person, but I wouldn't talk to Georgia very
[00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:33.800]   So dynamic totally different like when I did it live like there's just so much fun
[00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:39.720]   You can see when someone's looking at you kind of like what what did you just say and you can kind of be more playful
[00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:43.320]   You don't have to worry as much. I'd far prefer it. I think that that's
[00:48:43.320 --> 00:48:48.040]   Much more enjoyable. I think that there's benefits to doing it with technology base
[00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:52.600]   And I think that we're COVID we're very lucky. We're very fortunate those that can afford it
[00:48:52.600 --> 00:48:55.160]   But there's a huge digital divide if you are
[00:48:55.160 --> 00:49:00.280]   Tech phobic if you're changing phobic if you can't afford it if you don't have internet in your area
[00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:04.440]   It kind of cuts you off from a world that's kind of leaving you behind
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:11.640]   And I think that that interplay among people the stuff that you miss because you're only getting a kind of curated view
[00:49:11.640 --> 00:49:17.000]   Of someone is also a huge cost to interplay among people where there's
[00:49:17.000 --> 00:49:22.760]   More chance that you might misinterpret what someone's saying or they might misinterpret what you're saying and insult someone
[00:49:22.760 --> 00:49:28.280]   And you didn't really know that it happened and that also is can caught lead to a whole bunch of issues
[00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:30.760]   Bill, what do you think?
[00:49:30.760 --> 00:49:33.800]   Yeah, well, I I'm in the middle. I agree with
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:38.040]   Leo and and with you so I always enjoy
[00:49:38.040 --> 00:49:44.360]   Face-to-face conversations, you know, I always enjoy doing my interviews with people in the same room
[00:49:44.360 --> 00:49:46.440]   I always enjoy getting together
[00:49:46.440 --> 00:49:50.280]   When I would go to tech conferences when we used to go to tech conferences in the before times
[00:49:50.280 --> 00:49:54.120]   You know, that was my favorite part was making personal connections
[00:49:54.120 --> 00:49:58.840]   Um that you that that I felt were stronger when you were there together
[00:49:59.240 --> 00:50:02.680]   Um, so I think we have to strike a balance which is
[00:50:02.680 --> 00:50:11.560]   To Alex's point which is using this technology to allow us to overcome those geographic hurdles while at the same time recognizing
[00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:15.320]   I think the innate human need for that
[00:50:15.320 --> 00:50:19.880]   Personal face-to-face connection that you just don't get through a screen
[00:50:19.880 --> 00:50:24.040]   At least I just don't get through a screen and I think a lot of people don't get to it
[00:50:24.360 --> 00:50:29.960]   So we happen we we need to be purposeful in our, you know, connections that we make and that
[00:50:29.960 --> 00:50:37.880]   Um make an attempt to have those connections when we can and use the technology when we can
[00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:44.280]   So I don't necessarily think it has to be an either or I think we just have to be smart in our use of technology
[00:50:44.280 --> 00:50:48.200]   You know, it's either a benefit or a hazard and we just have to choose which it is
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:52.120]   I also worry and I think there's some evidence that there's deep psychosis
[00:50:52.760 --> 00:50:55.960]   That comes out of this uh this new way of being
[00:50:55.960 --> 00:51:00.040]   And I think that's one of the reasons the world is a little rocky right now
[00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:05.960]   But uh, that's it. Yeah, I mean, I think that I think I don't know if it's zoomed. It's causing
[00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:09.160]   Well, there's a lot of there's a lot of things that are
[00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:12.920]   The isolation of pandemic uh on balance has not been good
[00:51:12.920 --> 00:51:15.400]   I think for people's technology
[00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:18.440]   I think that has been the thing that after you know, I I think that that's
[00:51:19.080 --> 00:51:22.760]   One of the interesting things about what we've experimented with in office hours because that's the big lab
[00:51:22.760 --> 00:51:24.840]   We've done it. We've met almost 600 days in a row
[00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:26.840]   We're all in this lab right now
[00:51:26.840 --> 00:51:32.280]   Right, but but it's but but we have you know 5 000 people in any any given day two or three hundred show up and
[00:51:32.280 --> 00:51:35.000]   There's 50 there all the time and the thing is is that
[00:51:35.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   Is that there's a connection that we've all had and I think that a lot of us consider that has been has been a big boat
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:46.280]   Um, so I think that a lot of us are the next one is it would have been if you'd all gone to summer camp together
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:52.360]   You know, here's the thing though is that we have right? No, well, yeah, but but I would have never met these folks
[00:51:52.360 --> 00:51:54.920]   Right like I would have never met them. I would have never been able to connect with them
[00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:59.400]   I would have I mean in any given day where we have people coming in from four or five different continents
[00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:04.040]   You know that are that are sitting there talking about how it is from there and people are understanding others
[00:52:04.040 --> 00:52:09.000]   You know in a much different way because of the the fact that they're when you're talking about
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:14.920]   Something that's that isn't in london. I agree when you're talking about someone that has in london or israel or south africa or the philippines
[00:52:14.920 --> 00:52:20.600]   We have people there every day from those countries, you know, and so so they can they sit there and talk about their their process to that
[00:52:20.600 --> 00:52:26.040]   And like for instance, we have on any given day 15 to 20 people talking at the same time
[00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:29.240]   Like in a like what we're doing here except with 15 to 20 people
[00:52:29.240 --> 00:52:35.240]   And it is very civil and just kind of works because we figured out how to do that after 600 times you could edit
[00:52:35.240 --> 00:52:37.000]   and
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:37.880]   The
[00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:42.440]   But what happens though is that we could never put that that group on stage you could never put 19
[00:52:42.520 --> 00:52:46.920]   I have put 19 people on stage. It's a horrible experience. Yeah, you know, it's a horrible idea
[00:52:46.920 --> 00:52:51.160]   You know and the mormon tabernacle choir, but other than that's not a good idea. So yeah
[00:52:51.160 --> 00:52:53.400]   So the thing is is that there's absolutely costs
[00:52:53.400 --> 00:52:58.280]   I think that but I think that a lot of the costs that we see when people are feeling disconnected
[00:52:58.280 --> 00:53:00.760]   I'm I'm gonna keep coming back to they're not
[00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:04.520]   Playing very hard like not just them but everyone around them
[00:53:04.520 --> 00:53:11.800]   Is not you know they have bad video bad audio and it makes a huge difference in how it how it appears when you're coming across at high resolution
[00:53:11.880 --> 00:53:15.080]   With good audio and you're it's a much more connected experience
[00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:22.360]   Is it the same as being in person? No, but it also doesn't require the flights and the cars and the parking and all the other things that are required to it
[00:53:22.360 --> 00:53:27.960]   Yeah, and so and and you can we need a little above so well and be part of it. We need both. We need human contact
[00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:31.160]   I think that's why bill we've talked a lot about
[00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:38.600]   Conferences and the loss of conferences. They've all gone virtual and most people who say well what we should do is some sort of hybrid thing
[00:53:38.600 --> 00:53:41.000]   Where we get the benefit
[00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:47.320]   Well, I know you may think that but I think for instance the apple events where they have pre-recorded stuff
[00:53:47.320 --> 00:53:47.720]   It's fine
[00:53:47.720 --> 00:53:51.640]   But there is also a place to get together and see the things and talk to engineers
[00:53:51.640 --> 00:53:57.560]   Those are valuable contacts too and maybe this is your natural tendency Alex and
[00:53:57.560 --> 00:54:00.040]   No, no, just it's as well
[00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:07.640]   But honestly, I think that that there are a lot of us still for whom human contact is an important and I worry about there's a long
[00:54:08.840 --> 00:54:13.080]   I think there's a long term. I think it's not good. You do feel more connected when you meet someone in person
[00:54:13.080 --> 00:54:17.320]   That's just the way that we do and plus a lot of the way that we feel
[00:54:17.320 --> 00:54:26.520]   Safe and with other people is through touch and through being able to speak to someone and you bond much more quickly when there's you can see more
[00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:31.080]   Of someone else that's there like this is the best that we can do under these circumstances
[00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:36.760]   But it's a we're glad we have this. I mean, I wouldn't be able to show if we couldn't do this, right? So it's good
[00:54:37.800 --> 00:54:42.520]   100% but it leaves a lot of people I think to your point Leo. I think it's accurate
[00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:50.120]   It leaves a lot of people feeling like they're lacking in other human people and if you are a solo person
[00:54:50.120 --> 00:54:52.680]   I see this all around me with a lot of people
[00:54:52.680 --> 00:54:57.880]   I'm sure you do in your practice and so I have people coming to me with anxiety about
[00:54:57.880 --> 00:55:04.040]   Being sequestered and secluded even though they have a computer and there's some people that don't have a computer
[00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:07.960]   We're very very fortunate even doing this show, you know what I fear and so far it hasn't happened
[00:55:07.960 --> 00:55:09.960]   But I wait but as you get older
[00:55:09.960 --> 00:55:18.120]   You slow down and the world continues to move at a high speed and it's the older people who are I would imagine increasingly feel isolated
[00:55:18.120 --> 00:55:21.000]   Well, because they just are not adapting to this brand the world that we're in
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:27.400]   One thing one thing that's interesting is average average age and office hours because we see it through when they register and so forth
[00:55:27.400 --> 00:55:29.400]   This is 46 years old
[00:55:30.360 --> 00:55:33.960]   I just want to tell you coming from the Medicare side of the fence
[00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:36.520]   That ain't old
[00:55:36.520 --> 00:55:44.280]   For an average, you know, and well, this is an interesting point too is that the there is a
[00:55:44.280 --> 00:55:48.120]   There is another cliff with really young people people under 30
[00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:52.680]   Right and they have a different cold different environment and understanding of this
[00:55:52.680 --> 00:55:57.800]   Yeah, I watch my son with his tiktok and it's just not I don't get it. It's like I don't get it
[00:55:57.800 --> 00:56:01.560]   Well, I don't get how they relate. I don't get what they do for a good time
[00:56:01.560 --> 00:56:06.840]   I don't get it, but that's normal, right? But that's normal. That's how we never get what how our stuff
[00:56:06.840 --> 00:56:11.320]   Yeah, cut your hair and stuff playing that rock and roll. Yeah, hey, I gotta take a break
[00:56:11.320 --> 00:56:14.920]   I we've gone on this has been such a good conversation. We've gone way too long
[00:56:14.920 --> 00:56:18.520]   I just need I need to take a break we can come back to this or we have lots of other things to talk about
[00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:23.960]   Georgia Dow is here my personal internet therapist youtube.com/georgidow
[00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:28.600]   She's very kindly offered her email address for people who do feel a little stress or want a little
[00:56:28.600 --> 00:56:35.960]   Information about things they can do. She's got a great videos too, but the email address is Georgia at west mount therapy
[00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:39.480]   Dot com. That's her therapeutic group and of course share videos

[00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:48.520]   Our show today brought to you by something we use all the time and I love stripe
[00:57:48.520 --> 00:57:52.760]   uh, what a great way to improve your
[00:57:52.760 --> 00:57:59.480]   Posture and uh in terms of ecommerce. We use stripe for our payment platform on club twit
[00:57:59.480 --> 00:58:04.920]   That's when I first I mean I knew i've known about stripe for years, but that's when I really became a customer man
[00:58:04.920 --> 00:58:08.040]   I am now blown away by stripe
[00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:14.360]   Um stripe is the payments platform with stripe your business can easily optimize your payments infrastructure
[00:58:14.360 --> 00:58:18.360]   Simplify its expansion plans create new revenue streams
[00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:23.400]   And all help you grow and initiate change rather than having to react to it
[00:58:23.400 --> 00:58:30.680]   Those of us who are stripe users and stripe customers often remark about the incredible efficiency stripe adds
[00:58:30.680 --> 00:58:37.320]   To businesses like shopify to post mates to twilio. They all use stripe to power their global payments
[00:58:37.720 --> 00:58:41.240]   We use a member full, which is a patreon company and they use stripe
[00:58:41.240 --> 00:58:44.360]   Twilio and this is I think pretty typical
[00:58:44.360 --> 00:58:53.240]   Increased its authorization rates by an impressive 10 with stripe and they actually tested it with an ab test using multiple global payment processors
[00:58:53.240 --> 00:58:57.240]   Stripe help post mates generate over 70 million dollars in revenue
[00:58:57.240 --> 00:59:02.680]   Increasing their authorization rates. I've seen stripe users on twitter say as much as 20
[00:59:03.800 --> 00:59:06.360]   Improvement stripe is great. It's easy to use
[00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:11.480]   Once integrated their single platform and world-class docs documents are so important
[00:59:11.480 --> 00:59:15.400]   Allow businesses to easily experiment so you can scale and grow revenue
[00:59:15.400 --> 00:59:22.120]   And stripe is a leader. I mean they process billions of dollars every year for every size business
[00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:27.800]   From pre-seed startups to fortune 500 companies with stripe and this was important to us
[00:59:27.800 --> 00:59:32.520]   You're easily international. They support 135 plus currencies and payment types
[00:59:33.080 --> 00:59:38.120]   And they're always improving stripe does not sit or still they did not rest on their laurels
[00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:44.280]   There are new features hundreds every year new improvements to help you stay ahead of the industry as it moves
[00:59:44.280 --> 00:59:48.120]   And I love the five nines api uptime
[00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:51.800]   250 million plus api requests a day
[00:59:51.800 --> 00:59:56.520]   We launched club twit this year with stripe as our payment platform. It's seamless
[00:59:56.520 --> 00:59:59.240]   And accepting payments and issuing refunds
[00:59:59.240 --> 01:00:02.280]   We couldn't be happier with that in fact if you've if you've

[01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:09.880]   And it's great that you can get a 135 different currencies and payment methods in there

[01:00:12.520 --> 01:00:15.560]   Producing quality podcasts
[01:00:15.560 --> 01:00:19.880]   While we don't have to worry about the payments and the money movement because stripe does it for us
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:24.760]   Stripe also and I always like to talk about this with uh with our sponsors

[01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:03.160]   Thank you stripe for making it so easy to run club twit and
[01:01:03.160 --> 01:01:05.880]   Thank you for supporting this week in tech
[01:01:05.880 --> 01:01:08.520]   stripe.com
[01:01:08.520 --> 01:01:11.800]   All right, we talked about apple. I guess we should give google equal
[01:01:11.800 --> 01:01:18.840]   Time google's pixel six and pixel six pros phones, which are absolutely zero secrets about
[01:01:18.840 --> 01:01:22.840]   I'm hoping scoogle has some one little thing that no one knows
[01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:26.120]   The ads for the pixel six have now been leaked
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:28.840]   We there's very little
[01:01:29.160 --> 01:01:31.640]   Uh that we haven't seen about this
[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:38.680]   Pricing I think we're going to see a 750 dollar for the pixel six somewhat under
[01:01:38.680 --> 01:01:40.680]   Uh
[01:01:40.680 --> 01:01:42.680]   $1,000 for the pro
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:47.080]   Custom tensor chip a system on a chip designed by google
[01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:53.000]   Uh pretty colors, although i'm not sure all color combinations will be available on all platforms
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:55.640]   um
[01:01:55.640 --> 01:01:59.240]   They they um, I think this is going to be very interesting, but you know
[01:01:59.240 --> 01:02:04.120]   We don't really know much until it actually comes out
[01:02:04.120 --> 01:02:06.920]   Well, maybe we do look at this table
[01:02:06.920 --> 01:02:12.680]   This looks like the specs table you would see at the announcement i'm most interested in the cameras
[01:02:12.680 --> 01:02:17.640]   Uh, the pro will have three cameras a 50 megapixel wide 48 megapixel
[01:02:17.640 --> 01:02:23.560]   Telly and a 12 megapixel ultra wide of course google's camera software has always been great
[01:02:23.560 --> 01:02:27.240]   They've kind of rested on their laurels for the last two releases
[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:31.560]   In fact, I didn't even get a pixel five because I thought my pixel four was more than adequate, but
[01:02:31.560 --> 01:02:34.360]   I'm ready for the pixel six
[01:02:34.360 --> 01:02:39.960]   I think the the camera's everything at this point. It is isn't it's a it is a uh, uh, uh,
[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:42.520]   That's what you use the phone for
[01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:50.600]   Probably more than actually a phone is taking pictures and so so I think that rightly so both apple and google have spent an enormous amount
[01:02:50.680 --> 01:02:56.440]   And sam song who has spent just an enormous number of amount of engineering time on trying to make trying to figure out where they get their
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:57.960]   What makes them different?
[01:02:57.960 --> 01:03:00.760]   You know apple's gone down one path with the last phone where they have
[01:03:00.760 --> 01:03:07.800]   apple pro res and macro and you know those types of things and google is going towards resolution which if it turns out well
[01:03:07.800 --> 01:03:13.000]   There's going to be a whole they're able to carve away a group of people where that's more important than what apple's power
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:19.720]   I've been happy with 12 megapixels for many generations now, right? Yeah, yeah, uh, but we've seen you know, I remember
[01:03:20.520 --> 01:03:21.400]   Uh
[01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:25.720]   Windows phones from nokia with 41 megapixels. I thought that was a lot
[01:03:25.720 --> 01:03:29.240]   50 is it you think you'll actually be 50
[01:03:29.240 --> 01:03:33.240]   The hard part is is that when you get to the size good lord
[01:03:33.240 --> 01:03:40.760]   The hard part is the irata related so a lot of this is computational photography because the the issue you get into is that the irata created by having
[01:03:40.760 --> 01:03:44.520]   Such small sensor sites so you know to do 50 megapixels theoretically
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:50.440]   Um, you know if you really have a sensor that's able to take 50 megapixels for a small sensor on the camera
[01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:51.960]   That means that each
[01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:54.680]   Photo site that is saying i've i've that's seen light
[01:03:54.680 --> 01:03:58.520]   It is uh, there's a lot of chance that it could be a little wrong
[01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:02.600]   And that's what we see with grain and when we start gaining up we start seeing those things and so as
[01:04:02.600 --> 01:04:04.520]   When you make that
[01:04:04.520 --> 01:04:09.400]   You know, you want to make the chip larger so that you can get better low light performance you can get more
[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:14.120]   Uh, you know better quality a quality of pixel, right?
[01:04:14.120 --> 01:04:16.120]   And that's what apple is really focused on
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:20.440]   More of each pixel getting better as opposed to putting more pixels into it
[01:04:20.440 --> 01:04:25.560]   Now there are a lot of things you can do once you have a 50 megapixel image when you shrink it down to a 12 megapixel image
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:31.320]   It's going to get rid of that as well and so so having the raw resolution especially in well lit scenes
[01:04:31.320 --> 01:04:37.960]   Could be advantageous, but it's it's still it's a lot of pixels to put into a whatever size they're putting in one third one half inch chip
[01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:39.960]   Yeah
[01:04:39.960 --> 01:04:42.680]   Are you uh bill an androder of iphone guy
[01:04:43.400 --> 01:04:48.680]   Well, you know, I love android hardware. I had the new samson fold three for a really long time
[01:04:48.680 --> 01:04:51.480]   And I love the device but you know, isn't that funny?
[01:04:51.480 --> 01:04:57.880]   I actually still have mine because I bought yeah, you know samson mine sitting in a box over here and you know samson
[01:04:57.880 --> 01:05:00.760]   Rep if you're listening and you want to let me keep it, you know
[01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:09.240]   No, i'll send it back, but um, it's good. Isn't it isn't it surprising? I mean i'm not a fan of the fold
[01:05:09.240 --> 01:05:11.240]   But I really like the flip
[01:05:11.640 --> 01:05:16.440]   Yeah, I mean it is you know, I kind of I expected to like the folding phones
[01:05:16.440 --> 01:05:20.680]   I tried the first ones and um, you know, I was kind of so so on them
[01:05:20.680 --> 01:05:23.400]   Uh, but I like I like them now
[01:05:23.400 --> 01:05:26.520]   I think there is a real use case for them and for me personally
[01:05:26.520 --> 01:05:31.880]   I I would actually spend my own money and buy one of them. The problem is
[01:05:31.880 --> 01:05:36.680]   I am my daily driver is an apple and so you know, I
[01:05:37.240 --> 01:05:42.920]   Deep into the apple ecosystem and my personal life and so I don't see myself actually, you know
[01:05:42.920 --> 01:05:47.000]   Just switching out of that ecosystem and going android and google
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:50.600]   Of even if I love the hardware so so that's kind of hard
[01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:54.760]   Um, and you know, what's really interesting you were talking about the cameras on the pixel six
[01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:58.920]   I'll be interested to see what the new tensor chip and the hardware and the phones
[01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:01.720]   Alex your point can do around
[01:06:01.720 --> 01:06:07.080]   Photos right? I mean and they've got this magic eraser feature, I guess that is rumored
[01:06:07.880 --> 01:06:10.440]   To come out that'll remove things from the photos
[01:06:10.440 --> 01:06:13.800]   Um, I don't know. I mean, I'm kind of caught in the middle
[01:06:13.800 --> 01:06:20.920]   I love apples commercials and all the high-end phone commercials where they show people who are filmmakers using them to create films
[01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:29.240]   But I never you know use my phone to capture anything that that's it that's um, that's that interesting and exciting
[01:06:29.240 --> 01:06:33.960]   So I don't know if I've reached a point where kind of phones are good enough
[01:06:34.040 --> 01:06:39.160]   I mean you can always get a little bit better, but uh, I don't I don't know, you know, I'm I'm still you know
[01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:44.680]   I'm still about the ecosystem more so than the hardware on the camera. I'm also not a fan of the
[01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:46.520]   simulated
[01:06:46.520 --> 01:06:51.400]   Either portrait motor cinematic mode. I feel like I can tell the difference. I don't know Alex you you
[01:06:51.400 --> 01:06:55.640]   You absolutely can tell the difference. Yeah, it's fake. It's like those fake
[01:06:55.640 --> 01:06:59.960]   Backgrounds are the fake blur that people are using on zoom it bugs the hell out of me
[01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:05.560]   I think that there are times when it hits it. Okay. I play with it a little bit. I admit I don't use it very much either
[01:07:05.560 --> 01:07:12.600]   Um, but but I think that it's um, it's I think that there is a place for it. Um when you're making ticktocks or
[01:07:12.600 --> 01:07:16.440]   Yeah, maybe yeah, um, but and when I do product shots
[01:07:16.440 --> 01:07:20.520]   Sometimes I use it because it just it just gets rid of whatever's the errata behind it
[01:07:20.520 --> 01:07:24.920]   And on products where you don't have hair it doesn't cut it all, you know cut off all the little
[01:07:25.400 --> 01:07:31.320]   Bits that make it feel unreal. So so I think that um, I think that uh that
[01:07:31.320 --> 01:07:36.760]   That I don't think is that exciting. I think that the the macro on on apple's phone is
[01:07:36.760 --> 01:07:43.080]   Unbelievable like and and that is so exciting. I mean it is like I can't stop I do I use it all the time
[01:07:43.080 --> 01:07:47.160]   Like like is that also synthesized or is that actually a close focus?
[01:07:47.160 --> 01:07:53.080]   One to one. It's a close. I don't think it can synthesize that it's doing. It's yeah, it's doing some of it some of it is is
[01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:59.240]   Um, there's a some of it is computational folks that I mean I wrote a good article about how the
[01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:03.080]   Close focus works and that yeah, it's a it's a mix of
[01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:07.640]   Yeah, sorry. You can see that you can see when it flips over. That's exactly right. Yeah, that's exactly
[01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:12.840]   But it's like it's too exciting. I can't even I've been waiting for macro for ages
[01:08:12.840 --> 01:08:18.440]   I have here we go. My eyeball. Love it. Look at that. Oh, she's done a mac. That's a beautiful iris. I must say
[01:08:18.440 --> 01:08:21.000]   Thank you. Yes. Yes
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.400]   You have many many colors in your eyes. It's so cool
[01:08:23.880 --> 01:08:26.280]   How'd you wave it? How did you do that? Did you just put it up to your eye?
[01:08:26.280 --> 01:08:28.840]   Yeah
[01:08:28.840 --> 01:08:30.840]   Yes, I stuck it next to my eye
[01:08:30.840 --> 01:08:38.120]   Right, but with the the bad camera. Yes. I had a camera looking at the camera. Oh, so you know where to position it
[01:08:38.120 --> 01:08:41.000]   Yeah, is that your wallpaper?
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.400]   That it isn't do you think it should be should I change?
[01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:45.800]   Can you send it to me because I want to make it my wallpaper?
[01:08:45.800 --> 01:08:51.720]   I'll totally I'll totally what color is that? Is do you have the hazel eyes? What color?
[01:08:52.760 --> 01:08:54.760]   Green green
[01:08:54.760 --> 01:08:59.960]   There's no you guys tell me what's a that looks like a fossil that looks like
[01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:04.760]   Thank you. I don't know Leo if you say it's beautiful and it looks like a
[01:09:04.760 --> 01:09:12.840]   Looks like a thin section a thin section of a mineral. It's beautiful. No, it's uh
[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:17.640]   I don't know what drugs you took in your youth, but it's definitely there's something going on
[01:09:17.640 --> 01:09:21.080]   in that iris
[01:09:21.640 --> 01:09:24.920]   I don't know. I'm not sure how I feel about these statements
[01:09:24.920 --> 01:09:31.560]   Look at you should if I wanted as my wallpaper that should tell you something there we go
[01:09:31.560 --> 01:09:34.360]   You get it the macro
[01:09:34.360 --> 01:09:37.960]   Well, the macro is so interesting because this is what I love about technology
[01:09:37.960 --> 01:09:45.160]   Um year 10 years ago when I was just starting doing cracking open a series on tech republic that we did where we would take apart
[01:09:45.160 --> 01:09:51.160]   Technology and I would take I would use a very expensive macro lens and a really expensive
[01:09:51.480 --> 01:09:53.480]   DSLR to take these
[01:09:53.480 --> 01:09:58.760]   These macro pictures, you know these very small pictures of the chips inside devices
[01:09:58.760 --> 01:10:07.640]   And now you can do that with your phone and the pictures are you know almost as good or as good as what I was taking with the probably
[01:10:07.640 --> 01:10:11.720]   Five six seven thousand dollars worth of camera equipment. So, you know
[01:10:11.720 --> 01:10:19.160]   That's the amazing thing about technology that now you get that functionality in the you know in the palm of your hand and your pants pot
[01:10:19.160 --> 01:10:22.920]   John can you zoom in on my uh zoom in on my eye here
[01:10:22.920 --> 01:10:33.880]   I'll send you your I'll send you mine if you send me your I'm gonna I'm gonna do that. I'm sending it right now
[01:10:33.880 --> 01:10:38.600]   Of course, I don't have a 13. So I I'm getting simulated
[01:10:38.600 --> 01:10:44.520]   I think what's great for us as well is that is that they're that both companies are focusing on something different
[01:10:44.600 --> 01:10:52.440]   So google is going towards resolution and apple is going towards other things, you know, and I think that's it's a really here's something interesting
[01:10:52.440 --> 01:10:57.960]   This again is just rumor. Uh, although like I said, uh, google is a leaky sieve when it comes to this stuff
[01:10:57.960 --> 01:11:01.640]   Uh, it looks like they're also going to announce something called pixel pass
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:05.320]   which I'm intrigued by
[01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:12.840]   A monthly subscription that gives you a pixel phone with the promise of regular upgrades are those hardware upgrades? Maybe
[01:11:13.400 --> 01:11:15.400]   it gives you, uh
[01:11:15.400 --> 01:11:19.640]   Google one play pass youtube premium and network coverage from google phy
[01:11:19.640 --> 01:11:23.720]   You get an extended device warranty preferred care or device protection
[01:11:23.720 --> 01:11:28.760]   Now, uh, I doesn't say I don't know what the price is of this the leak did not include that
[01:11:28.760 --> 01:11:34.120]   We'll have to see or where it will be available, but that is kind of interesting. I'm already a google phy user
[01:11:34.120 --> 01:11:36.600]   So this might be a
[01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:41.560]   Apple kind of offers that uh where you you get a new phone every year
[01:11:42.200 --> 01:11:44.520]   Yeah, the iPhone upgrade program. Yeah, yeah
[01:11:44.520 --> 01:11:49.000]   But I think this is includes a whole bunch of other stuff. I mean if it's a good deal
[01:11:49.000 --> 01:11:51.400]   Google has to do something
[01:11:51.400 --> 01:11:57.320]   Because let's be honest. They just don't sell these phones very well. They're not in phone stores people don't see them
[01:11:57.320 --> 01:12:04.360]   Uh, it's really a small group of people people who listen to this show are are all about androids show who buy these pixel
[01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:07.080]   phones the other question will be
[01:12:07.080 --> 01:12:08.440]   will we see
[01:12:08.440 --> 01:12:10.440]   the foldable because picks google is a
[01:12:11.080 --> 01:12:14.840]   rumored to be working on a foldable phone for some time
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:17.320]   Um
[01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:23.000]   The one rumor said that they were going to start producing the phone this month, which means probably they would announce it
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:29.400]   Well, and I think that one of the advantages that google has is that there's so many other people using their operating system that they don't
[01:12:29.400 --> 01:12:36.360]   You know, they need to build one that allows them to dog food things allow it keeps them in the market and make sure that they still
[01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:43.400]   Have the ability to turn that on and that does allow them to keep trying to push some technologies forward with all of their partners
[01:12:43.400 --> 01:12:47.160]   But but their situation is different where I think they need to be cash positive
[01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:52.680]   But I don't think they need to have the same I don't think their their goal is to take the the same size of the market
[01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:55.160]   You know, they had android has that for them
[01:12:55.160 --> 01:12:59.240]   Yeah, I mean google has many irons in the fire
[01:12:59.240 --> 01:13:03.240]   Right obviously, but you have to wonder what is the business model for pixel
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:10.760]   Uh early on it was like well, this is a reference device for people who you know developers and others who want to play with a pure android device
[01:13:10.760 --> 01:13:12.920]   I don't know what the model is now is well
[01:13:12.920 --> 01:13:19.560]   The the issue is is that if you if you decided if if if uh, samsung if if you're not making these phones
[01:13:19.560 --> 01:13:21.560]   It would take you, you know
[01:13:21.560 --> 01:13:27.640]   Five years to be able to make a phone and if samsung decided hey, we want to use our own operating system now google's in big trouble
[01:13:27.640 --> 01:13:32.120]   You know, so so google, you know, they they need to be constantly developing hardware
[01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:35.160]   They need to be pushing that envelope all the time because that is
[01:13:35.160 --> 01:13:39.880]   It's not only a way to set up a reference and to kind of keep trying to keep pushing people forward
[01:13:39.880 --> 01:13:42.680]   Um, you know and making sure that everyone's getting better
[01:13:42.680 --> 01:13:45.960]   But it also means that they have that if they need it
[01:13:45.960 --> 01:13:51.960]   To continue to push forward. So I know I think that it's absolutely necessary for them to to do what they're doing. Yeah
[01:13:51.960 --> 01:13:56.760]   Uh, well, we'll find out so we'll be doing the live stream uh monday
[01:13:57.880 --> 01:14:02.920]   A 10 a.m. Pacific 1 p.m. Eastern time mica sergeant and I will cover the apple event
[01:14:02.920 --> 01:14:05.720]   Tuesday
[01:14:05.720 --> 01:14:13.080]   Jason howl and I will be covering the google event 10 a.m. Again, uh, a pacific time 1 p.m. Eastern time
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:15.320]   That'll be followed by mac break weekly
[01:14:15.320 --> 01:14:21.480]   All about android that evening. I don't know if we're going to do anything at all for samsung poor little samsung
[01:14:21.480 --> 01:14:25.880]   There unpacked two event is wednesday october 20th
[01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:29.640]   7 a.m. My time which is right there. That's a that's a
[01:14:29.640 --> 01:14:34.840]   Showstopper right there. I ain't getting up for this and I don't think they'll have anything much
[01:14:34.840 --> 01:14:37.480]   They would now they've already announced their phones
[01:14:37.480 --> 01:14:39.960]   Uh, I don't know what it
[01:14:39.960 --> 01:14:44.040]   I think the general consensus is it's going to be new features or just
[01:14:44.040 --> 01:14:48.280]   Well, we have stuff too. Don't forget us and all the uh
[01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:51.160]   Excitement about google and iville
[01:14:51.160 --> 01:14:55.640]   I don't know if they'll have any new hardware. They could you know, um, there's nothing stopping them
[01:14:55.640 --> 01:14:59.320]   But it seems like this is going to be especially with the part two
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:06.600]   Monicker to this it's going to be an it's an ad on event, right? You know, this isn't the revenge of unpacked, right?
[01:15:06.600 --> 01:15:11.640]   So, you know, we'll be uh, it'll be interesting to see what they roll out, but I suspect
[01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:18.120]   It's going to be just building on what they announced before new additions. Maybe, um, new flavors
[01:15:18.120 --> 01:15:21.320]   Really
[01:15:23.320 --> 01:15:29.240]   And and like you I love my samson galaxy flip three. I think they they are making one of the most interesting phones
[01:15:29.240 --> 01:15:31.720]   It's at least it's on a slab of glass
[01:15:31.720 --> 01:15:34.040]   Um, so
[01:15:34.040 --> 01:15:38.840]   I we'll talk about it. I'm sure on wednesday, uh, either on windows weekly or twig
[01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:43.320]   Immediately after so you can we'll we'll catch you up on what's going on
[01:15:43.320 --> 01:15:46.600]   All right, let's take another break and uh come back. We have more
[01:15:46.600 --> 01:15:51.160]   To talk about but now we've covered the big events coming up this week
[01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:53.240]   Now, you know
[01:15:53.240 --> 01:15:57.240]   And I hope you will join us as we do we do our traditional thing is to stream the event
[01:15:57.240 --> 01:16:03.560]   And snark about it in the background kind of the mystery science theater 3000 version of these events
[01:16:03.560 --> 01:16:06.440]   Our show today brought to you by novo
[01:16:06.440 --> 01:16:11.320]   Novo is the number one business banking app
[01:16:11.320 --> 01:16:18.600]   So what are traditional bank accounts like it's kind of rhetorical question backed with fdic insurance. Yeah, and that's good
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:20.280]   Uh fees
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:23.400]   Well, you know, there's always going to be some hidden fees in the fine print
[01:16:23.400 --> 01:16:27.000]   Mobile apps that are an afterthought absolutely
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:33.000]   Most banks mobile apps, uh, feel like they were invented in the 90s

[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:45.400]   Many banks actually charge you

[01:19:35.720 --> 01:19:39.720]   William shatner boldly going
[01:19:39.720 --> 01:19:43.960]   We're only a few well maybe a 50 60 men have gone before
[01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:50.360]   Did you now now georgia i want to give you i want to i want to get your reaction your emotional reaction
[01:19:50.600 --> 01:19:58.360]   Did you watch the launch in jeff baz was his penis rocket did you did you watch bill shatner come back i'm sorry i should do that to you
[01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:04.680]   When did you watch bill shatner come back and and he was in tears he was in he was so moved
[01:20:04.680 --> 01:20:07.400]   Was that cool
[01:20:07.400 --> 01:20:12.120]   I think it was cool like i would totally go up into space if i could um you got a quarter of a million
[01:20:12.120 --> 01:20:20.120]   That's the thing that's the thing that bothers me. It's just like i don't know it's these billion hairs doing
[01:20:20.520 --> 01:20:21.560]   You know
[01:20:21.560 --> 01:20:24.680]   Billionaires and billionaires doing things that you're like like
[01:20:24.680 --> 01:20:30.200]   It's just so self-initiating and i'm like, ah, we could have used money for something else
[01:20:30.200 --> 01:20:34.600]   That's just the piece of it, but the other pieces william shatner going to space. That's awesome
[01:20:34.600 --> 01:20:39.800]   I'm a stall star trek fan. So like i'm i'm totally with it. I think that that's really cool
[01:20:39.800 --> 01:20:42.520]   but
[01:20:42.520 --> 01:20:47.000]   Like it wasn't it wasn't I was not moved like it was not a huge thing for me
[01:20:47.080 --> 01:20:49.080]   i'm happy for him, but
[01:20:49.080 --> 01:20:52.200]   I don't know. Does it does it really help the planet any how does it benefit?
[01:20:52.200 --> 01:20:56.360]   I I will I don't respect money wisely. I had the same reaction and of course
[01:20:56.360 --> 01:21:01.720]   I I really didn't like uh how much they promoted the fact that their astronauts when Bezos went up
[01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:06.440]   It really I found a little bit offensive because they're not they're not really doing anything
[01:21:06.440 --> 01:21:09.800]   That you know, alan shepherd didn't do 50 years ago
[01:21:09.800 --> 01:21:15.080]   But when shatner came back at least I did understand one benefit of sending non astronauts
[01:21:15.560 --> 01:21:19.480]   up into space artists poets people who can talk
[01:21:19.480 --> 01:21:22.520]   is he really
[01:21:22.520 --> 01:21:24.760]   Expressed in so in such a beautiful way
[01:21:24.760 --> 01:21:29.080]   The moment of going out of the atmosphere into the black of space
[01:21:29.080 --> 01:21:34.920]   And really realizing how fragile our planet was and I thought that was quite beautiful and quite real
[01:21:34.920 --> 01:21:41.480]   And so I do think there is an advantage to sending people like shatner up because they're going to give us a take on this
[01:21:41.960 --> 01:21:46.680]   That we can identify a little bit better with in the astronauts and engineers who have preceded him
[01:21:46.680 --> 01:21:50.920]   Which might then do some good in some way, right?
[01:21:50.920 --> 01:21:54.920]   I I mean, we have to remember that I mean for for better for worse
[01:21:54.920 --> 01:22:00.760]   Most of the things many things that we have in the world are rich people's like we're rich people
[01:22:00.760 --> 01:22:05.240]   Messing around, you know, like, you know with their money and instead of spending it all where it should go
[01:22:05.240 --> 01:22:11.800]   I mean, you know the the helicopter was you know an auto gyro and you know, like that was a rich person trying to figure something out
[01:22:12.440 --> 01:22:17.240]   You know and you know and you know the but a lot of the things that we you know the the
[01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:22.360]   Conquo, you know the whatever we sent ships out all over the place and we've done all those things and again
[01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:25.160]   Not all of it was net positive for everyone
[01:22:25.160 --> 01:22:29.160]   But but the point is is that a lot of technology goes through by people starting this way
[01:22:29.160 --> 01:22:32.200]   There's going to be some point 20 or 30 years from now that we're
[01:22:32.200 --> 01:22:34.120]   um
[01:22:34.120 --> 01:22:37.880]   That we are doing this all the time and that's this is where it starts
[01:22:37.880 --> 01:22:41.160]   You know, it's never going to happen when the government's doing it because it's just it's just too much
[01:22:41.640 --> 01:22:46.360]   You know, there's just this is a lot of money that we're not that the government isn't spending on doing that and it allows
[01:22:46.360 --> 01:22:53.880]   NASA to focus on things that are like mars, you know and like other things because there's other there's someone else taking care of those things for them
[01:22:53.880 --> 01:22:57.880]   So I think that I think that there's a real, you know interesting possibility
[01:22:57.880 --> 01:23:02.840]   You know, I think it's it's easy to say well they should put that money somewhere, but while it seems like a lot of money
[01:23:02.840 --> 01:23:06.680]   It it's not a lot of things. It's spreading out to trying to fix problems
[01:23:06.680 --> 01:23:08.200]   It's not it's not that much money
[01:23:08.360 --> 01:23:12.200]   Like it won't it won't solve anything more than what's already being solved. I mean, you know, what you know, it's
[01:23:12.200 --> 01:23:19.240]   Better use than this like it could do more good and I'm not this is a this is a very expensive
[01:23:19.240 --> 01:23:26.680]   Amusement park ride. It strikes when I'm watching it. It's like yeah. Well, like that's an amusement park ride. Good. I'm glad you got to go
[01:23:26.680 --> 01:23:31.320]   Yeah, but I think I think that in the action nothing breakthrough happening here is nothing
[01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:34.600]   We don't know solving any problems. We haven't already solved a hundred times
[01:23:35.400 --> 01:23:37.720]   Go ahead, though. No, I would just wonder
[01:23:37.720 --> 01:23:40.920]   Part of me because I can see both sides of the argument
[01:23:40.920 --> 01:23:48.040]   You want to make sure that our financial resources whether they're private or public are being put to good use at least you'd like to think that
[01:23:48.040 --> 01:23:56.280]   On mass right for society's benefit as a whole, but you know, I wonder if some of the backlash is just from the
[01:23:56.280 --> 01:24:04.600]   Amount of kind of showmanship or excess celebration. That's what talked to me. Yes. Yeah, and so you know, I like you leo
[01:24:04.760 --> 01:24:09.960]   I did watch it and I listened to shatners words and I think a lot of listen to a lot of the scientists
[01:24:09.960 --> 01:24:17.160]   That I do and some astronauts, you know, that was the benefit they see is putting regular people
[01:24:17.160 --> 01:24:20.920]   Into space who can come back and share their experiences
[01:24:20.920 --> 01:24:26.360]   And show others that this is a future that we want to take these are
[01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:33.560]   The voyages as a species we want to make we need to move out and there's a real possibility of being able to do this
[01:24:33.560 --> 01:24:37.880]   So I would which I thought you got to some degree maybe
[01:24:37.880 --> 01:24:46.040]   With some of the early space exploration missions, you know, where sure there were ticker take parades people were hailed as heroes
[01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:48.680]   Of course, you know, and I well deserved
[01:24:48.680 --> 01:24:55.640]   But I get the sense that it was a collective celebration around something look what we have done
[01:24:55.640 --> 01:25:00.520]   As opposed to look what I have done. I'm gonna pop the champagne
[01:25:00.920 --> 01:25:03.320]   And it's all and even though you make you know
[01:25:03.320 --> 01:25:11.720]   Bezos or Richard Branson talk about the teams that they have and amazing people there and so does musk with spacex
[01:25:11.720 --> 01:25:16.760]   Um, you still when you see those images, you just got a little bit of yes
[01:25:16.760 --> 01:25:22.440]   It's you know, it's me and and that rubs people a little bit the wrong way. I think yeah
[01:25:22.440 --> 01:25:25.640]   I'm you know, I
[01:25:25.640 --> 01:25:30.520]   It's a mixed bag and yeah, and I do feel like uh, I've been reading
[01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:33.000]   Bradstone's new book about amazon amazon amazon
[01:25:33.000 --> 01:25:39.000]   I'm bad. He talks a lot about blue origin and while there is this aspect of billionaires competing, you know
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:41.720]   Bezos
[01:25:41.720 --> 01:25:47.880]   Damn that elan musk. He got the contract and musk going. Ah, what's he doing? That's not you know, there's that a little bit of that
[01:25:47.880 --> 01:25:51.480]   but uh, honestly what blue origin is hoping to do
[01:25:51.480 --> 01:25:54.280]   Is is very important
[01:25:54.280 --> 01:25:56.600]   Uh, you know and and and Bezos is a businessman
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:00.840]   He says this is one of my investments that might take decades to pay off
[01:26:00.840 --> 01:26:05.640]   but ultimately I expect blue origin to make money mining asteroids or
[01:26:05.640 --> 01:26:12.200]   Uh, maybe in space tourism. I think space tourism has to be the least important thing that blue origin is doing
[01:26:12.200 --> 01:26:14.760]   um, you know,
[01:26:14.760 --> 01:26:18.440]   And it's about building that infrastructure. Yeah, you know, exactly
[01:26:18.440 --> 01:26:22.280]   Right, you know, he's just said he couldn't have built amazon
[01:26:22.680 --> 01:26:29.320]   Without the infrastructure that already existed of the host office of fed eggs and shipping and the internet
[01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:35.000]   So we need that infrastructure of space flight for all the great entrepreneurs to envision
[01:26:35.000 --> 01:26:41.000]   New businesses and opportunities beyond the planet as well as people like channer to tell us look
[01:26:41.000 --> 01:26:44.120]   You know, if you screw up the planet if you screw up the environment
[01:26:44.120 --> 01:26:50.280]   We don't have anywhere else to go space is hard and cold and it's death
[01:26:50.680 --> 01:26:54.840]   So we should really take care of the planet. So and and just like, um
[01:26:54.840 --> 01:26:59.560]   You know every a lot of people that i've talked to just like georgia. I would go in a heartbeat
[01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:02.520]   So if anyone i would be willing to fund my ship
[01:27:02.520 --> 01:27:07.080]   You know send it my way and uh, i'm on the next ship. Yeah
[01:27:07.080 --> 01:27:12.520]   Yeah, I'd rather go in orbit, but if i can't go in orbit and i'm maybe shouldn't go in orbit
[01:27:12.520 --> 01:27:16.200]   Uh, uh, I wouldn't mind the amusement park, right?
[01:27:16.360 --> 01:27:21.320]   Yeah, it's you know what we live in interesting times, don't we at least we're going we're doing stuff
[01:27:21.320 --> 01:27:26.120]   For there were there was a period of time there after the end of the shuttle where we weren't doing much at all
[01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:29.000]   So it's nice that we're kind of back in space
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:32.440]   Um
[01:27:32.440 --> 01:27:39.080]   Are you going to get a vibe flow georgia? Now I know you're big into uh, virtual reality
[01:27:39.080 --> 01:27:45.400]   I i'm gonna wait i'm gonna wait and see are you are you excited to try it out leo?
[01:27:45.640 --> 01:27:49.080]   So i'm you know, I wanted to ask you about it because you use the
[01:27:49.080 --> 01:27:55.480]   Use the vibe use the vibe don't you as well as the oculus rift i believe you do yes, and we have a vibe. I love the vibe
[01:27:55.480 --> 01:28:01.800]   I'm not a vr fan like you are georgia's family has three rooms dedicated to virtual reality
[01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:04.200]   So that they can all play at once
[01:28:04.200 --> 01:28:08.280]   Um, this looks this vibe is interesting. It's lighter
[01:28:08.280 --> 01:28:15.080]   It's it's it doesn't have a battery in it or power in it. You have to plug it into an external battery
[01:28:16.040 --> 01:28:19.240]   Uh, you don't need to wear glasses with it. It has a
[01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:23.000]   Diopter adjustment in there so you can adjust it to your eyesight
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:27.000]   $500, but vive says the flow is intended more
[01:28:27.000 --> 01:28:31.720]   For relaxation. It's not a gi- I think the others are for gaming more
[01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:38.600]   Um according to the information the intent of the vibe is
[01:28:38.600 --> 01:28:43.080]   More for sitting back and looking at things, you know
[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:48.040]   If if I could run this to do meditations and
[01:28:48.040 --> 01:28:51.320]   Oboeia experiences in my office
[01:28:51.320 --> 01:28:56.520]   I would be a hundred percent in because I would love to do exposure therapy
[01:28:56.520 --> 01:29:02.200]   Which I think is so in vivo exposure therapy is when if you have say a fear of elevators
[01:29:02.200 --> 01:29:05.880]   We're going to be going into elevators if you have a fear of heights. We're going to be taking the heights
[01:29:05.880 --> 01:29:12.040]   The wonderful part is that our brain the oculo our actual visual cortex of our brain
[01:29:12.680 --> 01:29:15.240]   It's so powerful that we do believe it if we see it
[01:29:15.240 --> 01:29:20.200]   Like if you've ever done any of the experiences where you're really high up and using like virtual reality
[01:29:20.200 --> 01:29:26.360]   You truly believe that you are there your body is like no, I'm there don't go and you'll have the full experience to it
[01:29:26.360 --> 01:29:32.040]   So this would be a wonderful standalone because it's affordable. It's on its own
[01:29:32.040 --> 01:29:35.960]   I don't need to set it up to a system. I don't need to make sure that all the cameras are there and there's no light
[01:29:35.960 --> 01:29:41.720]   It would be standalone and I could do meditations make you feel really relaxed and then do exposures
[01:29:42.680 --> 01:29:45.240]   I would definitely buy it and you might be able to do this
[01:29:45.240 --> 01:29:49.960]   So they they're proposing a five dollar ninety nine cents subscription per month of subscription
[01:29:49.960 --> 01:29:53.400]   But because you tie it to your android device
[01:29:53.400 --> 01:29:57.400]   It can also be a view screen for anything you could put on your android phone
[01:29:57.400 --> 01:30:02.760]   So presumably these ptsd treatment programs could be made available
[01:30:02.760 --> 01:30:04.680]   um
[01:30:04.680 --> 01:30:08.440]   As an app on the on the android phone and it could then be part
[01:30:08.680 --> 01:30:13.400]   And that's kind of nice because you can control it. They can do additional things with it. It does not have
[01:30:13.400 --> 01:30:17.320]   Hand controls and I wonder how you feel about that
[01:30:17.320 --> 01:30:22.600]   HTC said they don't feel like hand controls are rely hand tracking is reliable enough
[01:30:22.600 --> 01:30:28.440]   And robust enough and they're afraid that if they put it on the device and it doesn't do it reliably
[01:30:28.440 --> 01:30:32.600]   It's just bad for the brand. Have you how do you feel about that?
[01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:37.320]   I I don't like the fact that there's not hand controls. I think that interacting with things
[01:30:37.320 --> 01:30:39.960]   It's better if we interact in person with it
[01:30:39.960 --> 01:30:43.160]   It makes me feel disjointed to what I am controlling
[01:30:43.160 --> 01:30:49.320]   And I don't think that the system is like when I when you use like a quest and you have like at least a little bit of hand control
[01:30:49.320 --> 01:30:56.200]   Even though it's not fully tracking everything. I find that's much better experience for me than being able to use another manner of tracking for it
[01:30:56.200 --> 01:30:59.320]   So that would be another reason why I probably wouldn't get it
[01:30:59.320 --> 01:31:00.360]   But again
[01:31:00.360 --> 01:31:04.680]   We're getting closer to be able to treat people in ways that you know
[01:31:04.680 --> 01:31:10.680]   They can really be helped and I think that that's an area of virtual reality that has not been properly explored
[01:31:10.680 --> 01:31:12.520]   Well, and this would be a good candidate for it. It's light
[01:31:12.520 --> 01:31:19.400]   You know, there's no straps you have to adjust you're not strapped into the VR headset. It's just like putting on kind of weird
[01:31:19.400 --> 01:31:21.960]   I think that there's a lot of goals
[01:31:21.960 --> 01:31:27.640]   I think that there's some there are definitely some places where you don't need to interact
[01:31:27.640 --> 01:31:30.040]   That you could just experience a space
[01:31:30.040 --> 01:31:33.720]   Experience walking around and looking at something without having to actually
[01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:38.680]   Touch it, you know, and so like we've we've done some museum
[01:31:38.680 --> 01:31:45.640]   Stuff where we've you know virtual museums where it's like a 30 by 30 space and you can walk around in it and you can
[01:31:45.640 --> 01:31:52.280]   Just experience it. You're not you're not interacting with the statues. You're the virtual statues. You're just walking around and looking at them
[01:31:52.280 --> 01:31:58.520]   And so so I think that there's definitely a place for not having to deal with all the other bits and pieces to it
[01:31:58.520 --> 01:32:01.480]   I also think that in some cases there's
[01:32:02.600 --> 01:32:04.600]   Some folks that that I know have been working on
[01:32:04.600 --> 01:32:11.560]   PTSD for you know and some of that treat some treatment that's related to it along with you know augmenting
[01:32:11.560 --> 01:32:13.640]   Augmented treatment
[01:32:13.640 --> 01:32:18.760]   And in those areas they're not using any of that they're really just experiencing what they what they need to experience
[01:32:18.760 --> 01:32:24.280]   For some reason HTC took some heat because they're photos
[01:32:24.280 --> 01:32:27.320]   of the
[01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:33.800]   Vice were really just photos of stock photos of people with the device photoshopped onto it
[01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:41.160]   Um, it's not the same photo. It's not the same exactly with the same person girl. Yes, it's wearing the same clothes
[01:32:41.160 --> 01:32:42.680]   Um
[01:32:42.680 --> 01:32:45.240]   This is the this is the uh, iStock
[01:32:45.240 --> 01:32:51.800]   Photo and this is her wearing that's the same photo wearing, you know those ad budgets aren't what they use
[01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:56.040]   Yeah, I don't you know, they didn't do a shoot is not the end of the world
[01:32:57.160 --> 01:32:59.480]   uh, I feel a lot of times that is the
[01:32:59.480 --> 01:33:05.560]   Uh, someone probably used those photos for the like as the test and then they just
[01:33:05.560 --> 01:33:08.680]   What what happens there? Here's the behind the scenes on some of that
[01:33:08.680 --> 01:33:13.480]   Is you go down you download a bunch of stuff from iStock you comp everything in and you say this is what we want to do
[01:33:13.480 --> 01:33:19.240]   So in all the the tests for the ads you all have those things and now you're gonna go out and do the photoshoot
[01:33:19.240 --> 01:33:23.400]   Right and the photo and what happens is you do the photoshoot and you don't like it as much as the iStock ones
[01:33:23.400 --> 01:33:26.360]   And yeah, like you know, let's just stick with the ones we have it actually works pretty well
[01:33:26.360 --> 01:33:29.160]   It was a shoot there was probably a shoot there that just didn't didn't go
[01:33:29.160 --> 01:33:33.080]   Okay, you didn't didn't make it to the thing. Yeah, I don't think it reflects badly on the product
[01:33:33.080 --> 01:33:37.560]   It's just you know, maybe on the marketing department, but doesn't reflect badly on on the product
[01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:41.640]   Those are really expensive to shoot well, you know, like it's not like the it looks simple
[01:33:41.640 --> 01:33:46.280]   But to light it and to get all working and everything else is yeah as a thing and who knows?
[01:33:46.280 --> 01:33:51.320]   Maybe there was a you know, they're a time constraint. Maybe they didn't have the production. Yeah models ready
[01:33:51.320 --> 01:33:53.320]   Now they get free publicity about how
[01:33:53.320 --> 01:33:55.320]   I
[01:33:55.320 --> 01:34:03.400]   I'm glad to see actually hcc making war because I don't want facebook to own this space
[01:34:03.400 --> 01:34:06.120]   Yeah, I think the vibe is a good product
[01:34:06.120 --> 01:34:10.200]   I was worried that they might have decided that it's not enough money to continue development
[01:34:10.200 --> 01:34:12.200]   So it's good to see them making this
[01:34:12.200 --> 01:34:14.600]   Of course everybody's just waiting to see what apple does
[01:34:14.600 --> 01:34:18.760]   And uh, it's widely rumored that apple is both doing a vr and a mixed reality
[01:34:19.240 --> 01:34:23.320]   Headset the vr will be out maybe next year and then the ar set the year after
[01:34:23.320 --> 01:34:27.960]   I think that one one thing that's distinct from what apple's doing and what everybody else is doing is they're building the
[01:34:27.960 --> 01:34:36.280]   Production pipeline, right? Very very slowly. So if you watch what what's happening with usdz and motion and final cut and everything else
[01:34:36.280 --> 01:34:38.840]   They're putting all these 3d tools in that don't make any sense right now
[01:34:38.840 --> 01:34:44.520]   So so the um, you know, like a lot of those tools you're like, why would they do that and and um, and they have object capture
[01:34:44.920 --> 01:34:50.520]   So that you can capture 3d objects and so they're slowly seeding the market with the ability to create the content for it
[01:34:50.520 --> 01:34:52.040]   Which is what's missing?
[01:34:52.040 --> 01:34:55.480]   Um, right now it's it's pretty arduous to build content for
[01:34:55.480 --> 01:35:01.400]   Oculus or or for the vibe and so um, so making it something that anybody can do
[01:35:01.400 --> 01:35:07.480]   Um, is going to be is going to be a game changer. I think when when apple, um, does whatever they're going to do
[01:35:07.480 --> 01:35:09.720]   Um, I think that they're what they've done
[01:35:09.720 --> 01:35:12.440]   Is a very very orderly rollout
[01:35:12.760 --> 01:35:15.800]   Um, where they're just slowly adding the pieces that need to be added
[01:35:15.800 --> 01:35:19.640]   You can see it happening. It's very over the last five years
[01:35:19.640 --> 01:35:23.560]   Yeah over the last five years that usdz I think was four or five years ago is when they announced it
[01:35:23.560 --> 01:35:29.400]   And then they've been rolling out object, you know, they um, reality creator reality converter
[01:35:29.400 --> 01:35:35.480]   Object capture and you know, and then you know motion now has it you can open up a 3d model in preview
[01:35:35.480 --> 01:35:38.520]   And you know, and it's it's amazing
[01:35:38.840 --> 01:35:41.960]   You know, and so those are the kind of things that that are possible right now
[01:35:41.960 --> 01:35:45.880]   Georgie you still uh, high on VR and you still play as many
[01:35:45.880 --> 01:35:53.400]   Hours of VR as you did. I've been really busy. So I have not played as many hours, but yeah, there's some really cool games
[01:35:53.400 --> 01:35:56.840]   I don't I'm gonna get my husband to text me the game that he's playing right now
[01:35:56.840 --> 01:35:59.640]   Which it uses the entire room and it's a puzzle game
[01:35:59.640 --> 01:36:06.840]   Where it uses the room and it feels like you're moving around and you're like shooting a whip and then controlling something and then jumping to another platform
[01:36:07.240 --> 01:36:13.400]   Like an escape of virtual reality escape room kind of is it's more like indiana jones as a feeling
[01:36:13.400 --> 01:36:16.360]   And it works out really well and it's kind of fun
[01:36:16.360 --> 01:36:21.000]   And you're getting a little bit of physical activity and there's a new game by the makers of arisone of sunshine
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:25.000]   Which is a zombie, you know, you get to fight together zombie apocalypse, which is
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:29.880]   Really exciting and so there are some very cool games that are there
[01:36:29.880 --> 01:36:34.360]   But again, you know, it's it's for a certain set of people that will enjoy these games
[01:36:34.840 --> 01:36:39.400]   I love it when the when the family gets together to fight a zombie apocalypse. I think it's a real
[01:36:39.400 --> 01:36:44.040]   Heartbreak heart-touching moment, you know togetherness. I like that
[01:36:44.040 --> 01:36:46.920]   I have to say I
[01:36:46.920 --> 01:36:48.280]   Yeah
[01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:54.840]   I took an I took an oculus quest to the shore when my my extended family all went to the went to the shore and in uh in june
[01:36:54.840 --> 01:36:59.320]   And the only thing that slow the only time that that oculus quest got set down is when it ran out of batteries
[01:36:59.320 --> 01:37:04.760]   Right like it was really cool. Yeah, the kids were all just completely like there's always one kid sitting there
[01:37:05.400 --> 01:37:09.240]   Wandering around the space. Yeah, you feel like you're you're in the future
[01:37:09.240 --> 01:37:13.080]   I remember the first time I put one on it's like oh, this is what the future is going to be like
[01:37:13.080 --> 01:37:19.880]   Well, and we're still we're still dealing with the 320 by 240 version of this right so really close to what it could be
[01:37:19.880 --> 01:37:23.080]   Yeah, when we start getting into um higher frame rates
[01:37:23.080 --> 01:37:28.200]   So really we're really clamped down in the you know the 30 or 60 frames per second
[01:37:28.200 --> 01:37:33.400]   Uh and also the very low resolution of 4k per i, you know or or less oftentimes
[01:37:33.800 --> 01:37:40.200]   And so when we when we start seeing you know high frame rates in the 90 to 120 frame per second at you know
[01:37:40.200 --> 01:37:42.840]   8k per i
[01:37:42.840 --> 01:37:49.800]   It is completely different, you know, it's a completely different experience as you start to go down that path where it really feels like you're somewhere
[01:37:49.800 --> 01:37:52.280]   um, and so so I think that that's gonna
[01:37:52.280 --> 01:38:00.040]   We're still again. We're still looking like everything we've seen so far is like the 320 by 240 video version of what is probably
[01:38:00.040 --> 01:38:02.440]   still four or five years away
[01:38:02.680 --> 01:38:09.480]   Has anybody ever tried the pi max? This is an 8k kickstarter for an 8k VR. That's that that really looks dopey
[01:38:09.480 --> 01:38:11.160]   I
[01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:18.680]   I wonder if this ever shipped uh, they raised don't think it almost yeah. I don't think it did they raised 4.2 million dollars
[01:38:18.680 --> 01:38:21.480]   Yeah, yeah
[01:38:21.480 --> 01:38:24.360]   Okay
[01:38:24.360 --> 01:38:27.640]   I noticed I noticed estimated delivery
[01:38:27.640 --> 01:38:30.680]   January 2018
[01:38:31.240 --> 01:38:34.520]   Yeah, I'm thinking yeah, this might be one of those
[01:38:34.520 --> 01:38:35.720]   Yeah
[01:38:35.720 --> 01:38:40.360]   This is why it's still all about the content and I think this is what's important about Alex's point
[01:38:40.360 --> 01:38:44.520]   You know is that the pipeline has to be there of content that you're looking for that
[01:38:44.520 --> 01:38:46.520]   I'm still looking for that one killer app
[01:38:46.520 --> 01:38:53.080]   You know, I tried the oculus and I've tried the vibe and I've got a ps4 vr that I played
[01:38:53.080 --> 01:38:58.360]   Um, and it really you know, it was a completely different experience games that I had played in
[01:38:58.840 --> 01:39:03.160]   Um, not vr and then played in vr. I actually enjoyed the immersion a lot better
[01:39:03.160 --> 01:39:07.880]   Um, but to me there's still you know, I'm still not completely sold
[01:39:07.880 --> 01:39:09.080]   There's still
[01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:13.320]   Something missing yet for me to be able to say it's an essential technology
[01:39:13.320 --> 01:39:14.120]   So
[01:39:14.120 --> 01:39:19.160]   I hope as the tech gets better the content gets better so you're you find that one thing
[01:39:19.160 --> 01:39:25.560]   Maybe this is a solution to the conversation we were having earlier where you have those face-to-face interactions in vr
[01:39:26.120 --> 01:39:31.080]   Um in the metaverse and that's the uh, that's the tech conference of the future
[01:39:31.080 --> 01:39:34.680]   I think that that's gonna be further away than most people think
[01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:38.360]   You know, I think that when when we talk about you know, like we you know, we
[01:39:38.360 --> 01:39:40.360]   I've been playing since second life
[01:39:40.360 --> 01:39:44.680]   I've been playing with you know virtual and my my daughter is an interior designer in roblox
[01:39:44.680 --> 01:39:49.240]   Like she literally people pay her roblox money to like do their house up and stuff like that
[01:39:49.240 --> 01:39:49.960]   So
[01:39:49.960 --> 01:39:53.400]   So I see a lot of I see a lot of roblox and um and I uh
[01:39:53.960 --> 01:39:57.160]   And I've been watching a lot of this and I think that people get very excited about it
[01:39:57.160 --> 01:40:04.120]   But I find the process of the digitalization of a person to be uh really dehumanizing
[01:40:04.120 --> 01:40:06.280]   And and I think that it is
[01:40:06.280 --> 01:40:11.560]   It actually is I spent I've spent a lot of time, uh using you know using um
[01:40:11.560 --> 01:40:15.960]   Unreal or epics metahuman, which is an amazing by the way
[01:40:15.960 --> 01:40:19.720]   For what what I use it for which is pre visualization and everything else
[01:40:19.720 --> 01:40:22.760]   But when we start animating the face the problem is the face actually
[01:40:23.320 --> 01:40:27.880]   Metahuman faces look really close to human faces like it really starts to close that gap
[01:40:27.880 --> 01:40:32.680]   And it's immediately super weird, you know, like it's it's you know, so because it's uncanning valid
[01:40:32.680 --> 01:40:35.560]   Yeah, it is you get into the uncanny valley and you're like, okay
[01:40:35.560 --> 01:40:38.120]   And the problem is is to get to that
[01:40:38.120 --> 01:40:39.960]   We're still a long way away
[01:40:39.960 --> 01:40:44.280]   Like from from us being able to like have our own version of it and be able to capture our face accurately
[01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:46.040]   And be able to send it back
[01:40:46.040 --> 01:40:49.800]   I did a project where I did a bunch of metahuman and I would have been happier with them emojis
[01:40:49.960 --> 01:40:52.440]   And I understand the memoge is a little bit better now
[01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:55.240]   Whereby lowering that resolution and making it kind of cartoony
[01:40:55.240 --> 01:40:58.760]   I'm totally I'm impressed and i'm excited about it and it's really cool
[01:40:58.760 --> 01:41:04.760]   And it's so realistic but not really realistic and that's the part that I think I think it's going to take us at least a decade
[01:41:04.760 --> 01:41:07.800]   And I think that I don't know if we're gonna really feel like we need it
[01:41:07.800 --> 01:41:13.880]   You know, well, it's the it's the eyes right like it's always the eyes and video games even the best rendered video games
[01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:20.920]   The eyes and the way that the pupils dilate and where that they're looking is off and because we have a dedicated center of our brain
[01:41:20.920 --> 01:41:24.040]   That's actually tracking with this mirror neurons
[01:41:24.040 --> 01:41:28.760]   We know that it's off and that always causes this disjoint and it
[01:41:28.760 --> 01:41:35.400]   Really bothers me in video games and I would much rather have an animated version of people
[01:41:35.400 --> 01:41:39.480]   Where I don't expect it when it gets so close that it's real
[01:41:39.480 --> 01:41:42.920]   It's similar to you Alex when you're looking at people with a blurred background
[01:41:43.160 --> 01:41:47.480]   And you're like it's so close to being okay, but it's not your brain keeps on going. Okay, not okay
[01:41:47.480 --> 01:41:48.840]   Okay, not okay
[01:41:48.840 --> 01:41:54.520]   And so that same thing happens, but when it's a picture of a person that is really close to a person
[01:41:54.520 --> 01:41:59.640]   We're now misreading all of those firings of how they're reacting to things
[01:41:59.640 --> 01:42:07.800]   And they look a little bit dead-eyed and that we don't react very positively to at all like if there were zombies
[01:42:07.800 --> 01:42:10.360]   It's totally fine because we would expect the dead-eyed look
[01:42:11.480 --> 01:42:13.720]   You want to interact with your friends as zombies
[01:42:13.720 --> 01:42:18.760]   So that's why the shark and the suicide squad isn't so threatening because his eyes aren't dead. Yeah
[01:42:18.760 --> 01:42:21.880]   Yeah, they did try to make him cute. You have a star
[01:42:21.880 --> 01:42:25.160]   Pretty cute for like animated preachers
[01:42:25.160 --> 01:42:27.960]   It's so fast just alone, right? So
[01:42:27.960 --> 01:42:32.120]   He did a great job. He did a great job. It was one of my favorite, you know
[01:42:32.120 --> 01:42:37.240]   So that's just a moment. This was there. Don't send me hate. Don't send me hate send it to lio
[01:42:37.800 --> 01:42:41.480]   Forward the one talking about moral panic wall street journal article actually this one
[01:42:41.480 --> 01:42:44.520]   I'm throwing to you at georgia because you're an expert in this
[01:42:44.520 --> 01:42:46.360]   so
[01:42:46.360 --> 01:42:48.040]   apparently
[01:42:48.040 --> 01:42:54.120]   Uh doctors are starting to get an unusual number of young girls coming in saying they've got
[01:42:54.120 --> 01:42:55.960]   ticks
[01:42:55.960 --> 01:42:57.960]   facial ticks
[01:42:57.960 --> 01:43:03.240]   Movement disorder doctors were stumped at first writes the wall street journal girls with ticks are rare
[01:43:03.880 --> 01:43:08.360]   And these teens had an unusually high number of them which had developed suddenly
[01:43:08.360 --> 01:43:16.040]   After months of studying the patients and consulting with one another experts at top pediatric hospitals in the us canada australia in the uk discovered
[01:43:16.040 --> 01:43:18.360]   most of the girls had something in common
[01:43:18.360 --> 01:43:20.840]   tick tock
[01:43:20.840 --> 01:43:23.240]   according to a spade of recent medical journals
[01:43:23.240 --> 01:43:30.360]   articles doctors say the girls had been watching videos of tick tock influencers who said they had terett syndrome
[01:43:30.360 --> 01:43:33.640]   and
[01:43:33.640 --> 01:43:38.840]   Have is this crazy? Is this just moral panic or is this literally a thing?
[01:43:38.840 --> 01:43:44.120]   I mean they say the Salem witch trials were a case of hysteria among adolescent girls
[01:43:44.120 --> 01:43:49.640]   I'm not going to say that there are no cases of that actually happening that there's a contagion effect where there's something
[01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:53.720]   Someone that's popular and they have something in that can't get terett's by seeing a video of it
[01:43:53.720 --> 01:44:00.200]   Well, it wouldn't actually be considered terett's right it would be considered a nervous or anxious tick
[01:44:00.280 --> 01:44:04.840]   The problem is is that anxiety can create ticks anyways. So how do we know that they just don't?
[01:44:04.840 --> 01:44:09.240]   It's very common right and find me a teenage girl who doesn't live on tick tock
[01:44:09.240 --> 01:44:15.000]   Exactly that so it becomes one of these things that just because that there's a correlation does not mean that it's a causation
[01:44:15.000 --> 01:44:19.080]   Right. So these girls probably also all read books or
[01:44:19.080 --> 01:44:23.160]   All you like french fries. It's uh, that's what's causing it. Yeah
[01:44:23.160 --> 01:44:27.720]   So I'm not so sure like it's something that you need to kind of take a look at but I think that
[01:44:27.880 --> 01:44:32.360]   It's more of one of those things that the article it it could it like again
[01:44:32.360 --> 01:44:35.080]   It could totally positively be perhaps
[01:44:35.080 --> 01:44:38.520]   But I don't think that that is something that I would be the first thing that I would think about
[01:44:38.520 --> 01:44:40.920]   I would take a look and see what is their anxiety levels
[01:44:40.920 --> 01:44:42.600]   What have them they've been doing?
[01:44:42.600 --> 01:44:50.280]   What have they been consuming because I deal with so many people that have anxiety ticks and anxiety has been skyrocketing right after the pandemic
[01:44:50.280 --> 01:44:55.480]   People being locked inside spending a lot of time on social media. Yeah, it
[01:44:56.200 --> 01:45:00.440]   Would be one of again. I probably see this more than others because i'm an anxiety therapist
[01:45:00.440 --> 01:45:05.960]   So I would see anxiety more often and someone else that deals with other things might you know say that it could be something else
[01:45:05.960 --> 01:45:12.120]   But I would probably look to like the straightest line is probably the truth and it's just so much
[01:45:12.120 --> 01:45:17.880]   It's so very common to get ticks when you feel anxiety since march 2020 and what happened in march 2020
[01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:23.000]   texas children's hospitals reported seeing approximately 60 teens with such ticks
[01:45:23.640 --> 01:45:29.240]   Whereas in the past one or two cases a year john's hopkins your university's terets center
[01:45:29.240 --> 01:45:31.400]   says uh
[01:45:31.400 --> 01:45:38.600]   10 to 20 of pediatric patients have described acute onset tick-like behaviors up from two to three percent a year before
[01:45:38.600 --> 01:45:40.840]   But I think you're right anxiety
[01:45:40.840 --> 01:45:46.040]   Is is a problem in general thanks to uh things to pandemic
[01:45:46.040 --> 01:45:49.640]   What is weird is that there are a lot of ticktocks
[01:45:49.640 --> 01:45:52.680]   with with hashtag terets
[01:45:53.240 --> 01:45:55.240]   Uh, I guess because it's I don't know
[01:45:55.240 --> 01:46:01.560]   I don't I don't know what why billions literally it's it's it's again terets is something that people don't understand
[01:46:01.560 --> 01:46:07.000]   It's very very visual you get a lot of very divergent different types of reactions
[01:46:07.000 --> 01:46:10.120]   Right and so because of that it would probably considered more
[01:46:10.120 --> 01:46:17.880]   palatable to watch and so if you even if you like with with tick talk right like so you're looking you scroll you starting to like
[01:46:17.880 --> 01:46:22.680]   You know slow down it's tracking that and so because of that you're going to get more videos that deal with that
[01:46:22.680 --> 01:46:26.680]   And because it's going to be something that's kind of explosive and pops out and unexpected
[01:46:26.680 --> 01:46:32.600]   You're probably going to pause more often and so feels your feed this one. There's no explanation for this is in the same article
[01:46:32.600 --> 01:46:39.560]   A movement disorders fellow a caroline alvera noticed that numerous teens were saying the word beans
[01:46:39.560 --> 01:46:42.520]   often in a british accent
[01:46:42.520 --> 01:46:44.360]   beans
[01:46:44.360 --> 01:46:46.840]   Even patients who didn't speak english for saying it
[01:46:47.480 --> 01:46:50.680]   Some patients mentioned they'd seen tick-tock videos of others with ticks
[01:46:50.680 --> 01:46:55.640]   She created a tick-tock account started watching videos of teens and adults who said they had terets syndrome
[01:46:55.640 --> 01:46:59.000]   She discovered that one top teret influencer was a brit
[01:46:59.000 --> 01:47:04.360]   whose terets manifested as often blirting out the word beans
[01:47:04.360 --> 01:47:13.560]   She she studied 3,000 tick-tock videos found that 19 of the 28 most followed to teret influencers on tick-tock
[01:47:13.560 --> 01:47:15.800]   reported developing new ticks
[01:47:16.360 --> 01:47:18.360]   as a result of watching others
[01:47:18.360 --> 01:47:19.800]   videos
[01:47:19.800 --> 01:47:25.640]   We are very in easily influenced aren't we are we have parts of the brit? We are mimics like
[01:47:25.640 --> 01:47:31.640]   Humans are mimics by nature. We like to think that we're all we're we're like making our own choices and dealing with that
[01:47:31.640 --> 01:47:37.880]   But actually for most of our development we are just mimicking behavior right and that's what we do strong mimics
[01:47:37.880 --> 01:47:42.760]   So if you do have an influencer or even if you hang out with people that speak with an accent
[01:47:43.160 --> 01:47:49.000]   Every once in a while you may say a word with an accent or there's a lot of people that will just suddenly merge and chameleon into
[01:47:49.000 --> 01:47:51.480]   Saying things i do that all the time
[01:47:51.480 --> 01:47:57.320]   Walk it's just they're submerged in that and so that part of our brain that deals with mimicry which we also have
[01:47:57.320 --> 01:48:01.720]   Specialized neurons that just deal with mimicking behavior because of that
[01:48:01.720 --> 01:48:07.240]   Yes, an influencer that you like has a much greater influence like what you consume
[01:48:07.640 --> 01:48:14.680]   Actually physically modifies your brain. And so I think that we do need to take a look at we're very careful about what we consume in food
[01:48:14.680 --> 01:48:17.080]   We need to be even more
[01:48:17.080 --> 01:48:24.760]   Like important to take a look at what we consume for our brains because it is physically modifying the way that we feel about and what we do with things
[01:48:24.760 --> 01:48:27.560]   But people spend an average I just saw a statistic that
[01:48:27.560 --> 01:48:33.000]   Teenagers on average spent three or four hours a day on instagram
[01:48:33.000 --> 01:48:36.440]   When you're spending that much time doing anything
[01:48:37.400 --> 01:48:39.960]   uh, it's going to have an influence on you
[01:48:39.960 --> 01:48:43.880]   And think about that along with the fact that your
[01:48:43.880 --> 01:48:49.080]   Prefrontal cortex the part that deals with consequences to actions is not developed
[01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:53.880]   Yeah, so we end up with the parts of being able to be influenced and when you're a teen
[01:48:53.880 --> 01:48:56.440]   So when you're young your greatest influence is your parents
[01:48:56.440 --> 01:49:02.840]   But when you develop into teenagers like again, we have 100 000 year old brains in modern society
[01:49:02.840 --> 01:49:06.680]   But our brain is still pretty much cavemen not exactly but pretty much
[01:49:07.240 --> 01:49:09.240]   And so
[01:49:09.240 --> 01:49:11.240]   What do you mean?
[01:49:11.240 --> 01:49:13.240]   Go
[01:49:13.240 --> 01:49:17.800]   And so that was the time that we left our tribe and went off with
[01:49:17.800 --> 01:49:25.800]   To create another tribe was during our teen years so our peers become the greatest amount of influence on our behavior and what we're going to choose to do
[01:49:25.800 --> 01:49:28.680]   New York times has all this time
[01:49:28.680 --> 01:49:35.480]   Consuming social media and that is modifying your brain without the thought of consequences
[01:49:35.560 --> 01:49:38.920]   Which only is fully developed at the age of 24
[01:49:38.920 --> 01:49:41.640]   Wow
[01:49:41.640 --> 01:49:43.640]   I remember 24
[01:49:43.640 --> 01:49:46.600]   Distilling
[01:49:46.600 --> 01:49:49.000]   uh, the new york times today had an article about instagram which
[01:49:49.000 --> 01:49:52.760]   You know says they're struggling with fears of using their
[01:49:52.760 --> 01:49:58.040]   Their pipeline young young users instagram spends millions trying to attract young people
[01:49:58.040 --> 01:50:05.160]   Because that's how facebook hopes to stay relevant as as more and more young people leave facebook or never join facebook in the
[01:50:05.560 --> 01:50:07.560]   first place it says
[01:50:07.560 --> 01:50:12.360]   300 their global annual marketing budget 390 million dollars a year
[01:50:12.360 --> 01:50:16.760]   Was almost entirely dedicated to teenagers and starting in 2018
[01:50:16.760 --> 01:50:20.440]   And that's where that number that I just mentioned came from internal
[01:50:20.440 --> 01:50:23.000]   Faith instagram information
[01:50:23.000 --> 01:50:29.640]   Uh that the two former employees leaked to the new york times the average teen time spent on instagram during the pandemic was three to four
[01:50:29.640 --> 01:50:32.040]   hours a day
[01:50:32.040 --> 01:50:34.680]   yikes
[01:50:35.320 --> 01:50:36.920]   Yikes
[01:50:36.920 --> 01:50:38.920]   All right, let's take a little break we come back with more
[01:50:38.920 --> 01:50:41.880]   uh our show today
[01:50:41.880 --> 01:50:46.920]   Actually before we do the ad I do want to show you some of the things that happened this week because we had a very good week
[01:50:46.920 --> 01:50:50.600]   On a twit and john has a little video for you watch
[01:50:50.600 --> 01:50:53.080]   so basically everybody knows my
[01:50:53.080 --> 01:50:59.160]   Problem with the nest home hub and youtube music play the song skidder meringue by andy and sizanna
[01:50:59.160 --> 01:51:01.880]   tonight by andy williams
[01:51:03.560 --> 01:51:05.560]   What
[01:51:05.560 --> 01:51:10.600]   It's better play the song skidder meringue by andy and sizanna on youtube music
[01:51:10.600 --> 01:51:12.920]   What's up by for non-blond
[01:51:12.920 --> 01:51:15.800]   You can use it

[01:55:50.840 --> 01:55:53.560]   this week in tech
[01:55:53.560 --> 01:56:02.600]   Cannon's been doing this for a long time, but finally a class action lawsuit against the printer manufacturer
[01:56:02.600 --> 01:56:05.560]   By david leecraft
[01:56:05.880 --> 01:56:13.880]   He filed a class action lawsuit on tuesday alleging deceptive marketing and unjust enriched enrichment by the manufacturer
[01:56:13.880 --> 01:56:18.280]   What is cannon doing? Well, he's got an all-in-one machine
[01:56:18.280 --> 01:56:25.000]   The pixima mg 63 20 that will not scan or fax documents
[01:56:25.000 --> 01:56:30.840]   If the printer runs out of ink you have to buy ink before you can scan
[01:56:30.840 --> 01:56:34.440]   It doesn't use ink to scan. It's not printing anything
[01:56:35.480 --> 01:56:37.480]   It's not necessary
[01:56:37.480 --> 01:56:41.480]   But it won't work and this is of course. This is what a lot of pretty companies do
[01:56:41.480 --> 01:56:46.360]   You just can't believe they got away with it for so long. They got they've been doing this since 2016
[01:56:46.360 --> 01:56:51.320]   I was just gonna say I can't believe no one's brought a suit until now. Yeah, this seems absurd
[01:56:51.320 --> 01:56:56.920]   When he actually lawyers like the thing is is that you know the only person that makes money on this is lawyers
[01:56:56.920 --> 01:57:00.760]   And so I'm surprised that a firm hasn't gone wow, this is a really good class action suit
[01:57:00.760 --> 01:57:05.080]   There's a lot of printers out there, you know, i'm gonna make 33 percent of whatever we pull out, you know
[01:57:05.880 --> 01:57:11.320]   A support agent told him you could damage the printer if you if you scan without ink
[01:57:11.320 --> 01:57:13.400]   No
[01:57:13.400 --> 01:57:17.720]   No pixels, you know the pixels are connected. They're they're powered by the ink
[01:57:17.720 --> 01:57:21.080]   You don't know that you you're probably wonder when you had all those scans how you ran out of ink
[01:57:21.080 --> 01:57:25.480]   Yeah, so you were like you were printing him and not all the ink just the blue ink the blue ink is used
[01:57:25.480 --> 01:57:32.920]   For the actual scanning, you know process they they turn them the ink into into pixels. Oh brilliant
[01:57:32.920 --> 01:57:36.680]   You're gonna see see I that's that's I bet you some people actually believe that yeah
[01:57:36.680 --> 01:57:44.280]   People don't question it right like we just don't question it. We're like, oh, of course I must need ink so
[01:57:44.280 --> 01:57:51.080]   But the real reason is and we know what the reason is disease companies sell these ink jet printers for at or below cost for nothing
[01:57:51.080 --> 01:57:54.440]   They're 50 bucks. They're more expensive. They're more expensive than blood. Yeah
[01:57:54.440 --> 01:57:57.240]   The ink the ink yes
[01:57:57.240 --> 01:58:04.200]   Big and so they're gonna make it up with the ink in fact, and sometimes it's cheaper to buy a new printer than a set of ink cartridges
[01:58:04.200 --> 01:58:10.520]   Especially if it's a couple years old. Yeah, and you can't find the cartridges and local retailer online
[01:58:10.520 --> 01:58:15.320]   That's they're 50 60 bucks. Just get a part of the model. Yeah. We we used to
[01:58:15.320 --> 01:58:19.000]   When we were doing lots of events on site we buy printers all the time like locally
[01:58:19.000 --> 01:58:21.560]   And then we just give them to somebody in the crew like here have a printer like like
[01:58:21.560 --> 01:58:25.720]   Taking home
[01:58:25.960 --> 01:58:30.120]   It's not worth it. I remember injecting the ink with like the needle
[01:58:30.120 --> 01:58:36.200]   Inject like it was a horrible like I did it but like it was a horrible experience
[01:58:36.200 --> 01:58:42.440]   The companies that do the companies that do that always try to advertise on our radio show
[01:58:42.440 --> 01:58:46.200]   And I I always say I'm not gonna I can't I cannot
[01:58:46.200 --> 01:58:49.720]   But they advertise a lot on tech radio shows not on podcast
[01:58:49.720 --> 01:58:53.080]   But it's because anybody listens this show is smarter than trying to do that
[01:58:53.560 --> 01:58:56.520]   But they always want to buy radio shows. It must make a ton of money
[01:58:56.520 --> 01:59:01.320]   On these ink jet refills. Yeah, you have to use it as syringe
[01:59:01.320 --> 01:59:05.880]   A syringe. Yeah. Yeah, is it messy? It's very messy like
[01:59:05.880 --> 01:59:10.200]   I'm not good at it. You're a surgeon. You're probably just fine
[01:59:10.200 --> 01:59:13.000]   Well, and the way they get you know and by the way
[01:59:13.000 --> 01:59:17.000]   That might be the only way because a lot of these companies now if you use a third-party cartridge just won't work
[01:59:17.000 --> 01:59:18.840]   They they have chips in them
[01:59:18.840 --> 01:59:21.560]   Yes, and they just won't work at all so you have to buy first party and again
[01:59:21.560 --> 01:59:24.440]   It's very expensive as you said more expensive than blood
[01:59:24.440 --> 01:59:28.200]   Per and how often do you really print things at home?
[01:59:28.200 --> 01:59:34.040]   So what I always find myself doing is I buy a printer and the one that I have sitting right next to me here
[01:59:34.040 --> 01:59:38.520]   I probably had for five years. I think I bought ink for once
[01:59:38.520 --> 01:59:43.000]   Yes, I mean by the time I need to buy this all dried up. It's all dried up
[01:59:43.000 --> 01:59:47.480]   It's terrible. It's out of date. It won't connect to my iphone half the time
[01:59:47.880 --> 01:59:52.120]   It doesn't connect to Wi-Fi half the time. I'm just gonna toss it and buy a new printer
[01:59:52.120 --> 01:59:55.000]   I just you know it baffles me that you know
[01:59:55.000 --> 01:59:59.880]   We're still here it baffles me that there someone hasn't come up with a better business model
[01:59:59.880 --> 02:00:03.400]   Maybe they haven't because this is such a good lucrative business model
[02:00:03.400 --> 02:00:10.120]   You know, it's the razor blade model of printer. Yeah, I think the money is so I I had someone sent me a a UPS
[02:00:10.120 --> 02:00:15.160]   Label that I had to print out. I couldn't find a printer that worked in my house. I was like
[02:00:16.360 --> 02:00:19.960]   And I just went to UPS. I was like I was like they said did you print it out before you got here?
[02:00:19.960 --> 02:00:23.640]   I was like no, I don't I don't know how to do that. I can't print it's paper like like
[02:00:23.640 --> 02:00:26.520]   There's just some technologies that will not die
[02:00:26.520 --> 02:00:31.480]   That's one of them faxes. That's another one of them. They're just how to do that either
[02:00:31.480 --> 02:00:37.000]   Yeah, they won't die and companies still act as if oh, you got a printer don't you? No
[02:00:37.000 --> 02:00:40.120]   Well, I think that here's the thing that everyone's at home
[02:00:40.120 --> 02:00:44.200]   Right like there's like now I have to print my own little tiny like
[02:00:45.080 --> 02:00:48.200]   Note files because like I'm not going into the office to have them printed there
[02:00:48.200 --> 02:00:53.880]   And I don't want to have to honestly I came this close to buying an IBM selector typewriter
[02:00:53.880 --> 02:00:56.200]   Just so I could type on envelopes
[02:00:56.200 --> 02:01:04.760]   Like an actual typewriter. Yeah my hand yeah because my handwriting is so bad and I and I just
[02:01:04.760 --> 02:01:10.920]   Anyway, um what I ended up buying is a label printer that prints address labels and that's all I need
[02:01:10.920 --> 02:01:14.920]   Super I'm super fortunate to have a great wife. I I haven't she had hand or anything
[02:01:14.920 --> 02:01:17.960]   I haven't mailed I haven't mailed anything for decades
[02:01:17.960 --> 02:01:24.600]   Like I said on the stamp stock me was like and I have eight dollars
[02:01:24.600 --> 02:01:27.560]   I have leo stamps that I printed like five years ago
[02:01:27.560 --> 02:01:30.920]   They might picture on them because that was that's the thing you can do with stamps like huh
[02:01:30.920 --> 02:01:38.040]   But they're now the that they're so long ago that I have to put an additional stamper to just to pay for the postage
[02:01:38.600 --> 02:01:43.480]   And I have all these leo stamps because who mails stuff anyway? I know that's just so cute though
[02:01:43.480 --> 02:01:47.320]   You can't do it forever. Yeah, but you can't do forever leos. It turns out
[02:01:47.320 --> 02:01:51.720]   That's too bad a bunch of them
[02:01:51.720 --> 02:01:56.920]   I actually you know I want to use them up. I'll just put two leos on a
[02:01:56.920 --> 02:02:02.440]   Like really is the scent difference like you don't have to be exact like if it's like whatever
[02:02:02.440 --> 02:02:04.120]   I can do it over
[02:02:04.120 --> 02:02:07.320]   These are 47 steps stamps. What is posted Jeff 51
[02:02:08.040 --> 02:02:12.120]   So they so i used to Debbie printed me a whole sheet of four cents
[02:02:12.120 --> 02:02:14.840]   So cute
[02:02:14.840 --> 02:02:19.880]   Are they next year? I'll have to have another sheet of one set stamps. Yeah, I would just take two of them
[02:02:19.880 --> 02:02:21.880]   I would just be like oh, yeah, I would just take two I think
[02:02:21.880 --> 02:02:27.240]   You probably your board the extra you sent. Yeah, yeah
[02:02:27.240 --> 02:02:30.680]   For the six things that you mail out a
[02:02:30.680 --> 02:02:33.400]   You know a year
[02:02:34.040 --> 02:02:38.680]   Well, here's the sad thing and I feel terrible about this because I do a radio show
[02:02:38.680 --> 02:02:44.440]   I get a lot of older listeners who write me and I can tell because it's so like spidery hand writing
[02:02:44.440 --> 02:02:48.440]   Your leo and they write me these long handwritten letters
[02:02:48.440 --> 02:02:51.320]   I mean it's a very old school thing to do and it's I it's touching
[02:02:51.320 --> 02:02:54.440]   But they're just a they're piling up
[02:02:54.440 --> 02:02:58.920]   I can't what am I gonna do with those? I have to answer
[02:02:58.920 --> 02:03:01.560]   I had a friend who wrote me letters
[02:03:01.560 --> 02:03:06.520]   Even just a little tiny thank you and a little leo picture. That's why I got the stamps
[02:03:06.520 --> 02:03:08.600]   I was gonna do that exactly
[02:03:08.600 --> 02:03:14.200]   But I would just send a little like thank you so much for sending me that I think people just want to acknowledge that they're not like
[02:03:14.200 --> 02:03:17.320]   I will say a guy. I don't think that they need to have a personalized response
[02:03:17.320 --> 02:03:19.400]   I think that they know how busy you are
[02:03:19.400 --> 02:03:21.000]   On the air almost 24/7
[02:03:21.000 --> 02:03:26.040]   Which is a little photo with a thank you and some whatever leo stickers or twit stickers and they will be
[02:03:26.040 --> 02:03:29.320]   Plumb happy. I don't think that anyone expects you to send
[02:03:29.320 --> 02:03:31.240]   Church your your beautiful. Thank you
[02:03:31.880 --> 02:03:34.520]   I'll print out a picture of your iris and include that
[02:03:34.520 --> 02:03:38.280]   Thank you here's Georgia
[02:03:38.280 --> 02:03:40.440]   I don't think they'd be as happy. Yeah exactly
[02:03:40.440 --> 02:03:44.360]   You should make it like a little card like a little like I will I'm gonna maybe a magnet
[02:03:44.360 --> 02:03:46.360]   Like the hell is that on there
[02:03:46.360 --> 02:03:50.120]   He's looking at me
[02:03:50.120 --> 02:03:52.280]   Yeah
[02:03:52.280 --> 02:03:54.280]   On a magnet. Yeah
[02:03:54.280 --> 02:03:57.960]   All right squid game we gotta do it. We gotta talk about it
[02:03:57.960 --> 02:04:03.320]   You did a therapist reacts to squid game. This show is so successful for Netflix now
[02:04:03.320 --> 02:04:09.960]   Netflix does not want me to tell you this so I will not tell you this. I will let Bloomberg tell you this
[02:04:09.960 --> 02:04:13.560]   Bloomberg got confidential viewing data
[02:04:13.560 --> 02:04:21.240]   Netflix an attorney representing Netflix said in a letter to Bloomberg it would be inappropriate for Bloomberg to disclose the confidential data
[02:04:21.240 --> 02:04:22.920]   In the documents
[02:04:22.920 --> 02:04:28.520]   Netflix does not discuss these metrics outside the company and take significant steps to protect them from disclosure
[02:04:28.520 --> 02:04:35.800]   So I'm not saying this. I'm just reading a Bloomberg article. Okay, but according to Bloomberg
[02:04:35.800 --> 02:04:38.440]   At least
[02:04:38.440 --> 02:04:42.200]   132 million people have watched at least two minutes of squid game
[02:04:42.200 --> 02:04:47.800]   And that was in the first 23 days which actually made it the most popular Netflix show of all time
[02:04:48.840 --> 02:04:53.880]   And this is the number that Netflix never tells you because Netflix doesn't charge per show, right?
[02:04:53.880 --> 02:04:59.640]   So they do a complicated analysis that gives them an idea of the what they call impact value
[02:04:59.640 --> 02:05:01.960]   how much it was worth in terms of
[02:05:01.960 --> 02:05:06.680]   subscribers sticking around or new subscribers they estimate a
[02:05:06.680 --> 02:05:15.880]   891 million dollars in impact value and this is for a show that costs 21 million dollars to produce
[02:05:17.080 --> 02:05:20.680]   For the buying right. I think it was already pre-produced. I mean, I think that's what they bought it for
[02:05:20.680 --> 02:05:23.400]   No, I think they I think they
[02:05:23.400 --> 02:05:25.800]   That's a Korean show
[02:05:25.800 --> 02:05:27.480]   Um
[02:05:27.480 --> 02:05:33.880]   That's unclear to me. It sounds like that was production cut, but you're right. It would make more sense. That's what they paid for it
[02:05:33.880 --> 02:05:41.960]   Um, I like I say is like I we we opened it up on the on the uh tv and my my wife just went nope
[02:05:41.960 --> 02:05:44.520]   That was it. Yeah, I agree with it. I've seen that like
[02:05:45.240 --> 02:05:50.760]   Is that nope? Nope. Do you view watch the whole thing? Uh, Georgia? It's about some down and out Korean people
[02:05:50.760 --> 02:05:54.920]   They're all oh a lot of money to the mafia or whatever who are
[02:05:54.920 --> 02:06:00.920]   Forced to play this game to try to get money, but the games they're children's games
[02:06:00.920 --> 02:06:05.400]   But they're deadly. I guess that's enough. We don't need to say more than that. Is it good?
[02:06:05.400 --> 02:06:12.680]   It it is very I find it fascinating and I don't even think that it's far out of reach of what humans would actually do
[02:06:13.160 --> 02:06:16.920]   Like you can see people like you think about over the times like gladiators
[02:06:16.920 --> 02:06:19.640]   Not all gladiators were saved they slaves
[02:06:19.640 --> 02:06:21.640]   They were some gladiators that chose to do it
[02:06:21.640 --> 02:06:24.120]   There were some people that earned their freedom and chose to go back
[02:06:24.120 --> 02:06:32.440]   And take what happens with football players and olympic athletes and what happens to their body or people that are crab fishermen and or even people that
[02:06:32.440 --> 02:06:35.080]   Do this for nothing they climb Mount Everest, which is
[02:06:35.080 --> 02:06:37.240]   Very dangerous
[02:06:37.240 --> 02:06:41.640]   Has a great chance of death and it's for nothing at all but the accolades
[02:06:42.040 --> 02:06:44.360]   I think the only difference was if it would be on tv
[02:06:44.360 --> 02:06:48.120]   They would be more people going into these games in the hopes of winning money
[02:06:48.120 --> 02:06:50.600]   But if you're down and out and truly hopeless
[02:06:50.600 --> 02:06:56.200]   Any chance of hope might make you go off and do something and unfortunately human behavior
[02:06:56.200 --> 02:06:57.880]   We often
[02:06:57.880 --> 02:07:03.720]   overestimate our own skills and chances at things and so because of that you'd be like but I could win
[02:07:03.720 --> 02:07:07.320]   And so would choose to stick in because
[02:07:07.960 --> 02:07:12.680]   In the game as long as more than half the people decided to quit they still could
[02:07:12.680 --> 02:07:15.960]   So it was also about free will and choice
[02:07:15.960 --> 02:07:18.680]   And this was not where you were forced to do this
[02:07:18.680 --> 02:07:24.200]   You did have a choice if enough people that were dealing the games could stop and so I don't know
[02:07:24.200 --> 02:07:29.400]   I think that it is much more realistic than you know the dark side of humanity than we give it credit for
[02:07:29.400 --> 02:07:32.840]   So apparently they
[02:07:33.320 --> 02:07:37.000]   Did not use phony phone numbers in squid game and so now that flexing
[02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:43.320]   The producers siren pictures are editing out the phone numbers because several korean citizens have been bombarded
[02:07:43.320 --> 02:07:47.560]   With messages and calls from fans of the show
[02:07:47.560 --> 02:07:50.520]   Paid numbers so that every time they
[02:07:50.520 --> 02:07:53.160]   They should have a little tiny message
[02:07:53.160 --> 02:07:57.800]   That was a hard one to be from the actor and make a little bit of bank from this people still call
[02:07:57.800 --> 02:08:00.040]   Yeah
[02:08:00.360 --> 02:08:02.600]   I watched the first episode and I found it
[02:08:02.600 --> 02:08:05.880]   Interesting. I don't know if i'll watch more
[02:08:05.880 --> 02:08:10.520]   It's well i'm i'm like your your wife Alex
[02:08:10.520 --> 02:08:16.120]   It just never seemed to appeal to me and so i've never watched a single minute of it
[02:08:16.120 --> 02:08:21.880]   So other than the whatever the 30 second clip trailer is as I scroll through Netflix
[02:08:21.880 --> 02:08:29.480]   So you know and I think to george's point it is such but i've read about it and so I I know what to show us about it
[02:08:29.480 --> 02:08:36.440]   Is such a look at kind of the dark side of humanity that for me with all the other kind of things going on
[02:08:36.440 --> 02:08:43.000]   You know my viewing in my television viewing is more entertainment and it cuts a little too close to home
[02:08:43.000 --> 02:08:48.440]   I I prefer something a little more uplifting right now than that maybe that's it
[02:08:48.440 --> 02:08:52.840]   I'm just not in the mood to watch this during during pandemic and all the
[02:08:52.840 --> 02:08:56.120]   There you go. And i'm starting to develop Tourette's is what's happening
[02:08:57.080 --> 02:08:59.080]   I mean, I think that I think that I
[02:08:59.080 --> 02:09:03.960]   We talk a lot in our family when we watch media about what we put in our what we call our minds I
[02:09:03.960 --> 02:09:08.520]   You know like it and just and so we're really like if we see something that we're like whoa
[02:09:08.520 --> 02:09:11.000]   That's what's there. I don't want that in my head. Yes
[02:09:11.000 --> 02:09:15.240]   I work in challenging places around the world where people have gone through a lot and
[02:09:15.240 --> 02:09:20.360]   But I'd rather be doing something useful rather than just as entertainment. I just don't need to
[02:09:20.360 --> 02:09:24.760]   To work on work on that problem in that area. So I I keep it pretty
[02:09:25.480 --> 02:09:26.840]   Pretty basic
[02:09:26.840 --> 02:09:31.400]   But we still watch a lot of things. I mean just it just that when something that looks just holy like wow that is
[02:09:31.400 --> 02:09:36.360]   That is a crazy level of things. I just don't need to have I don't need to be thinking about it
[02:09:36.360 --> 02:09:42.600]   Yeah, I'm with you 100% I don't want that in my head, you know, because it'll it'll stay there. It'll come up
[02:09:42.600 --> 02:09:45.160]   It an an opportune moments
[02:09:45.160 --> 02:09:50.520]   Uh, wow you've heard about deep fakes. There are deep voice fakes
[02:09:51.400 --> 02:09:57.240]   Last year in the ua e a bank manager received a call from the director or director at the company
[02:09:57.240 --> 02:10:04.200]   Uh with whom he'd spoken before the director said his company was about to make an acquisition. He needed the bank to authorize transfers
[02:10:04.200 --> 02:10:07.800]   35 million dollars worth of transfers
[02:10:07.800 --> 02:10:11.240]   The bank manager knew the guy's voice
[02:10:11.240 --> 02:10:13.720]   So he did it
[02:10:13.720 --> 02:10:19.640]   What he didn't know is he had been duped that the fraudsters had used deep voice technology
[02:10:20.440 --> 02:10:22.440]   to clone the director's speech
[02:10:22.440 --> 02:10:32.440]   The uh, this is a court document unearthed by forbs just this week in which the ua e has sought american investigators to help tracing
[02:10:32.440 --> 02:10:37.000]   Half a million of those stolen funds because they went into us base bank accounts
[02:10:37.000 --> 02:10:41.800]   That's bad all we know but don't trust
[02:10:41.800 --> 02:10:44.760]   Don't trust the voice. Yeah, that's the
[02:10:45.480 --> 02:10:51.960]   Scariest thought because you could be called by someone that you recognize like they have all of these calls where they say oh, I'm your nephew
[02:10:51.960 --> 02:10:55.960]   I'm in jail. Please send this much money to bail me out
[02:10:55.960 --> 02:11:00.680]   And usually I'd be like, but you probably recognize your nephew like depending on how you gotta be a dog
[02:11:00.680 --> 02:11:06.280]   You're a bank manager and just says oh, yeah sure i'll transfer 35 million. No problem
[02:11:06.280 --> 02:11:09.560]   Just well, even if you're a grandparent that could work. Yeah
[02:11:10.440 --> 02:11:15.320]   That was my thought though leo right exactly is how poor were the controls at this bank?
[02:11:15.320 --> 02:11:17.640]   Yeah, that they allowed a transaction of that
[02:11:17.640 --> 02:11:23.480]   amount to be done based on one person's you know, you know one person's word
[02:11:23.480 --> 02:11:28.920]   Even if you recognize the voice and supposedly, you know after reading the story there were some email transactions, but still
[02:11:28.920 --> 02:11:33.080]   You know, i've been part of mna's i've gone through this process and there's like
[02:11:33.080 --> 02:11:35.160]   months of
[02:11:35.160 --> 02:11:41.880]   Work up to this there's multiple signatures. There's lawyers and banks. I'm just it just it baffles me
[02:11:41.880 --> 02:11:48.440]   Maybe i'm just not in the right circles and international kind of finance here, but uh, you know, it baffles me that
[02:11:48.440 --> 02:11:55.160]   This scam was able to work. I mean, maybe they tried it 50 times and this was the one time that it worked
[02:11:55.160 --> 02:11:58.680]   Yeah, and I think that also it depends on what what is the scale?
[02:11:58.680 --> 02:12:02.200]   How often does does that bank manager do a 35 million dollar transaction?
[02:12:02.280 --> 02:12:06.440]   How often do they what what amount of money is that related to is it related to
[02:12:06.440 --> 02:12:14.200]   Half a trillion dollars or 200 million dollars and and so you know, you know, he could be that could be like someone's chump change
[02:12:14.200 --> 02:12:17.560]   You know, like, you know, i've just like they you know that they lost it. It's a lot to us
[02:12:17.560 --> 02:12:23.400]   But but i've you know, i've seen people spend a lot of money on things that you know, that i wouldn't spend the money on i'm like
[02:12:23.400 --> 02:12:26.600]   Well, that's a lot of money, but but it's not um, but for them
[02:12:26.600 --> 02:12:31.160]   It's not you know, and so i think that i do think it's crazy and i i think the deep fakes
[02:12:31.160 --> 02:12:35.800]   I still i will argue that they're healthy for us because I think it's important for us not to trust
[02:12:35.800 --> 02:12:40.360]   Right what we see in here. It's it's really important that we you know, when we see something we go
[02:12:40.360 --> 02:12:42.360]   Okay, I need to see that from a couple different angles
[02:12:42.360 --> 02:12:47.640]   I need to verify and you know and and do all these other things when when i'm being asked to do something because
[02:12:47.640 --> 02:12:49.880]   It's always been that way to some degree
[02:12:49.880 --> 02:12:53.400]   I mean, that's how confidence games work as you believe that somebody is who they aren't
[02:12:53.400 --> 02:12:56.840]   Um, and I think that we're now getting really clear that you really can't
[02:12:57.880 --> 02:13:02.120]   Trust a video or audio at its base value and I think that that's good
[02:13:02.120 --> 02:13:04.360]   You know because I think that it keeps us from
[02:13:04.360 --> 02:13:06.680]   From believing things at face value because we really shouldn't
[02:13:06.680 --> 02:13:12.360]   You know the only problem with that though, Alex is that people are infinitely lazy by nature and so yes
[02:13:12.360 --> 02:13:17.320]   There will be some people that will try to use science or take a look at things or research
[02:13:17.320 --> 02:13:20.920]   But for most of us we like people don't even click an article anymore
[02:13:20.920 --> 02:13:27.160]   Like they see the title and that is what they believe and if it goes into what is already your cognitive
[02:13:27.480 --> 02:13:28.600]   bias
[02:13:28.600 --> 02:13:32.920]   We want to believe the things that are within our cognitive bias and so we won't even want to question
[02:13:32.920 --> 02:13:36.360]   We might even deny looking at other things that are not within our
[02:13:36.360 --> 02:13:40.280]   comfort level of bubble and so that
[02:13:40.280 --> 02:13:46.840]   Area of scope is unfortunately this could be then used to manipulate people even more easily
[02:13:46.840 --> 02:13:53.400]   I think that when I think I think you're right. I mean I think that that's definitely but we've been manipulated for a long time
[02:13:53.480 --> 02:13:57.160]   Oftentimes I'm the one with the shovel, you know and so the so the thing is is that
[02:13:57.160 --> 02:14:02.840]   Is that when we you know we do a lot of things to manipulate people like you know the kind of the camera and a crowd
[02:14:02.840 --> 02:14:08.360]   Um the kind of questions that we ask the words that we use, you know like all of those things drive that
[02:14:08.360 --> 02:14:12.920]   You know like so we're you know the you know how where people are allowed to put cameras where
[02:14:12.920 --> 02:14:18.920]   Uh, you know how when what was that person's position when we asked that question or how we put it together
[02:14:19.400 --> 02:14:24.680]   And so the thing is is that those are all things that we use to manipulate people in in how in in what we hand them
[02:14:24.680 --> 02:14:27.400]   You know and we try to have you know open conversations
[02:14:27.400 --> 02:14:31.240]   I think that that that that I think is why I have to teach media literacy because
[02:14:31.240 --> 02:14:36.760]   Yeah, people don't know how easily done that is and they believe in uh stuff they see
[02:14:36.760 --> 02:14:44.280]   Uh, especially on tme, you know, you you ask a bunch of things and then and then when you watch when you watch something on on tv that
[02:14:44.360 --> 02:14:50.280]   Every time, you know people don't know that when I cut when i'm shooting straight ahead and you're saying something
[02:14:50.280 --> 02:14:53.560]   And then I cut to a side shot and I cut back that means I cut something out
[02:14:53.560 --> 02:14:58.760]   Like that's what I use that shot for right when I when i'm cutting something out of that interview, right?
[02:14:58.760 --> 02:15:04.440]   Um, so you're but but it's so smooth that a person doesn't realize it and that's that is
[02:15:04.440 --> 02:15:07.560]   Just as manipulative as a deep fake
[02:15:07.560 --> 02:15:13.000]   Because i don't know how to cut something out that they set up. I don't think it's just as manipulative as a deep fake
[02:15:13.080 --> 02:15:17.160]   I think deep makes are probably more manipulative. Well, but you could put words in people's mouth
[02:15:17.160 --> 02:15:23.400]   I mean, it's easy. It's easy. You don't have to do a deep fake. You just edit it carefully and you could put words
[02:15:23.400 --> 02:15:27.960]   But now the now people can then use this to manipulate
[02:15:27.960 --> 02:15:32.600]   In a way that is scary to the person that they might be faking and put that out there
[02:15:32.600 --> 02:15:37.560]   Also, it doesn't even mean that you now have to commit a crime or do something wrong or worry about what's on your browser
[02:15:38.280 --> 02:15:43.160]   That now they can make it as believable that even you my question. Maybe I really did go there
[02:15:43.160 --> 02:15:45.560]   Right. Well, like it's
[02:15:45.560 --> 02:15:47.560]   I forgot. I don't remember
[02:15:47.560 --> 02:15:52.360]   But yeah, but but when when when we stopped losing when we start
[02:15:52.360 --> 02:15:56.120]   Lute, you know for a long time for instance dna was like one of those things like once we find dna
[02:15:56.120 --> 02:15:58.520]   You're done like you know when we have dna
[02:15:58.520 --> 02:16:01.160]   And then there was this thing called chain of custody and
[02:16:01.160 --> 02:16:05.800]   Chain of custody has basically in many places destroyed the dna evidence
[02:16:06.280 --> 02:16:10.680]   Because now as a like by the way, I probably shouldn't say it on here
[02:16:10.680 --> 02:16:15.080]   But like if you're if you're in a jury pool and you say I'm gonna be really interested in chain of custody
[02:16:15.080 --> 02:16:17.160]   You know how quick the prosecutor will get rid of you like
[02:16:17.160 --> 02:16:20.120]   Like they don't want to have any conversation about that
[02:16:20.120 --> 02:16:25.080]   They don't want any juror to think about chain of custody because because it unravels the entire trust
[02:16:25.080 --> 02:16:27.720]   The entire chain of trust
[02:16:27.720 --> 02:16:30.760]   Because it's almost impossible to maintain chain of custody
[02:16:30.760 --> 02:16:34.040]   Like like at a level at the same level as the dna itself
[02:16:34.600 --> 02:16:38.840]   And so but it's what but what's important is is that that that was too tight
[02:16:38.840 --> 02:16:42.360]   Like the dna by itself because it could be planted it could be inserted
[02:16:42.360 --> 02:16:45.320]   It could be there's lots of other places and us just blindly trusting
[02:16:45.320 --> 02:16:48.440]   Someone's dna i'm just gonna say
[02:16:48.440 --> 02:16:51.800]   You still have to gather the dna if it's actually there
[02:16:51.800 --> 02:16:58.200]   Like I guess you can say that it's not and yeah, sure. I mean, that's what that one is is that i'm not turning away in the old jade trial actually
[02:16:58.200 --> 02:17:01.000]   So yeah, it was yeah, but the thing is
[02:17:01.480 --> 02:17:05.400]   Yeah, yeah, and but it's it's one of those things that that it was
[02:17:05.400 --> 02:17:07.640]   It was too blind
[02:17:07.640 --> 02:17:09.160]   It's you're right that it's hard
[02:17:09.160 --> 02:17:15.800]   But it was too blindly followed for a long time where it was just and there's a lot of people in jail that shouldn't be there because they're because
[02:17:15.800 --> 02:17:19.480]   We put so much trust in you know scientific results
[02:17:19.480 --> 02:17:22.200]   when in fact
[02:17:22.200 --> 02:17:23.800]   Especially when we're
[02:17:23.800 --> 02:17:27.800]   When it comes to results and things that we've seen in the media you were talking about media training and
[02:17:28.120 --> 02:17:32.040]   I used to teach this in my class for folks. I don't know. I have a couple criminal justice degrees
[02:17:32.040 --> 02:17:34.600]   And I used to be an adjunct professor for a decade or so
[02:17:34.600 --> 02:17:36.120]   And so, you know
[02:17:36.120 --> 02:17:41.320]   We would talk about media bias when it comes to exactly what you were talking about and the csi effect
[02:17:41.320 --> 02:17:47.080]   We used to call it because you know people would see this technology as infallible and they would see things on television
[02:17:47.080 --> 02:17:54.360]   That they thought would the way the real criminal justice system worked and it wasn't and so they would be a prosecutors kind of worst nightmare
[02:17:54.440 --> 02:18:00.120]   And expect like this has to be perfect or they could be a defendant's you know, uh, defense attorneys nightmare too
[02:18:00.120 --> 02:18:03.160]   Expecting them to sort of have this exculpatory evidence
[02:18:03.160 --> 02:18:06.840]   That just wasn't how our justice system has really ever worked
[02:18:06.840 --> 02:18:09.720]   And I think that's kind of
[02:18:09.720 --> 02:18:14.680]   That's the quandary that we find ourselves in with technology whether it's internet, you know
[02:18:14.680 --> 02:18:17.800]   I know we've had some things happen this week around 230
[02:18:17.800 --> 02:18:22.440]   And and what it deep fakes so it is what do you trust?
[02:18:23.080 --> 02:18:25.480]   Right and how do we teach?
[02:18:25.480 --> 02:18:33.960]   How do we how do we help a large enough section of our society be skeptical enough that they ask those tough questions
[02:18:33.960 --> 02:18:39.240]   But also not be so skeptical that they don't believe anybody because as humans, right?
[02:18:39.240 --> 02:18:42.920]   You know, we trust relationships more than we trust facts, right?
[02:18:42.920 --> 02:18:46.680]   And so I think that's the balance that we're still trying to
[02:18:46.680 --> 02:18:52.440]   Figure out with all whether it's social media or whether it's deep fakes or whether it's a, you know
[02:18:52.440 --> 02:18:55.480]   Fight voice call. How do we manage that?
[02:18:55.480 --> 02:19:02.920]   Skepticism in a healthy way and that that's a hard question to answer and it you know to your point. Joy. You're it's not a it's not a
[02:19:02.920 --> 02:19:08.200]   Um, it's not a new question either. I want to take a quick break. We got a few more stories
[02:19:08.200 --> 02:19:13.000]   We'll wrap it up great panel build that while is here from tech republic good to have you
[02:19:13.000 --> 02:19:16.600]   I had no idea you're so, you know all about train of custody and all that stuff
[02:19:16.600 --> 02:19:19.320]   I love the csi effect
[02:19:19.960 --> 02:19:23.880]   Oh clearly this person has watched too many procedurals kick him off the jury your honor
[02:19:23.880 --> 02:19:29.560]   Uh, we got Alex lindsay who's dad is a prosecuting attorney states used to be used to be a long time ago
[02:19:29.560 --> 02:19:33.560]   So he knows a little bit about uh, cystic use us district us attorney
[02:19:33.560 --> 02:19:37.640]   So he knows a lot about these kinds of matters and georgia dao
[02:19:37.640 --> 02:19:41.480]   Whose videos include get the sleep you've always dreamed of
[02:19:41.480 --> 02:19:47.320]   boundaries and consequences understanding what anxiety is parenting
[02:19:48.680 --> 02:19:52.600]   How your thoughts are running the show dammit and
[02:19:52.600 --> 02:19:59.720]   Calm calm calm finally all of the anxiety dash videos.com. I've got more. I got the whole set
[02:19:59.720 --> 02:20:04.040]   Thank you for being here all three of you are show today brought to you by nareva
[02:20:04.040 --> 02:20:11.960]   When it's as you get back to the office and you want to have meetings and people are in different places and stuff as Alex said audio is
[02:20:11.960 --> 02:20:14.040]   Can kill
[02:20:14.040 --> 02:20:15.640]   A conference call
[02:20:15.640 --> 02:20:20.760]   Bad audio is the worst exhausts everybody it makes it hard to be in the meeting
[02:20:20.760 --> 02:20:24.920]   Nareva solves this problem now you know if you're faced with this
[02:20:24.920 --> 02:20:32.520]   Especially if you want to get a good audio and a in a fairly large room. I'm in size to large room
[02:20:32.520 --> 02:20:39.720]   I'm talking 25 by 25 to 30 by 50 you probably immediately think we're gonna get that pro av solution
[02:20:40.520 --> 02:20:45.480]   But but I just want to tell you there are better ways to do this than that complex expensive
[02:20:45.480 --> 02:20:52.280]   Pro av solution you set up pro av in a mid-sized a large meeting room. You've got multiple components
[02:20:52.280 --> 02:20:56.920]   You've got mics. You've got speakers. They're installed in the ceiling the mics are spread across the table
[02:20:56.920 --> 02:20:58.920]   And what else do you have with lots of cables?
[02:20:58.920 --> 02:21:04.440]   You'll need specialized technicians to tell you what needs to be bought to install it to calibrate it
[02:21:04.440 --> 02:21:08.440]   It'll take days to install in tens of thousands of dollars per room
[02:21:09.080 --> 02:21:13.560]   For purchase and installation. I still go to big businesses and see these very very expensive
[02:21:13.560 --> 02:21:21.240]   av setups when all they need is nareva nareva and ureva provides exceptional audio
[02:21:21.240 --> 02:21:27.400]   For rooms well one integrated nareva microphone and speaker bar will handle 25 to 25 feet
[02:21:27.400 --> 02:21:30.840]   Two bars will cover a space of up to 30 by 50 feet
[02:21:30.840 --> 02:21:37.960]   You can do it yourself. It's as easy to install as a as a sound bar takes about 30 minutes two screws one cable
[02:21:39.000 --> 02:21:45.240]   Fraction of the cost of av systems and it actually works better because of nareva's patented microphone mist
[02:21:45.240 --> 02:21:49.560]   Technology which puts thousands of virtual microphones
[02:21:49.560 --> 02:21:54.600]   Throughout the room so you can move around you can face away from them screen
[02:21:54.600 --> 02:21:59.320]   Everyone is heard no matter where they are and now with you know, you got to have social distancing
[02:21:59.320 --> 02:22:06.360]   Or you know you don't have to put dots on the table where people need to sit for a beam-forming system
[02:22:07.400 --> 02:22:12.040]   You don't have to calibrate or recalibrate in fact it continuously auto calibrates
[02:22:12.040 --> 02:22:17.400]   It's essentially computational audio and it's a really clever solution to all this
[02:22:17.400 --> 02:22:20.120]   So easy to do you can do it yourself
[02:22:20.120 --> 02:22:23.400]   They have a great console the nareva console a platform
[02:22:23.400 --> 02:22:27.320]   That's you monitor manage adjust and scale your fleet of systems from anywhere
[02:22:27.320 --> 02:22:31.720]   Great for multiple rooms and a fraction of the cost of the pro av system
[02:22:31.720 --> 02:22:34.680]   Sound great works great
[02:22:34.760 --> 02:22:37.880]   Easy to install easy to use no training required
[02:22:37.880 --> 02:22:41.960]   I just want to encourage you not to go with that pro av
[02:22:41.960 --> 02:22:47.080]   Modeled go to go to nareva.com/twit and learn more nurva
[02:22:47.080 --> 02:22:50.920]   Nureva.com/twit. I am a sound
[02:22:50.920 --> 02:22:53.080]   snob
[02:22:53.080 --> 02:22:58.360]   And this is a great solution doesn't require people to stay in the same place or face the same way
[02:22:58.360 --> 02:23:02.280]   It just works nureva and ureva.com
[02:23:02.840 --> 02:23:05.960]   slash twit we thank them so much for their support of this week in tech
[02:23:05.960 --> 02:23:11.080]   And thank you for supporting us by using that address so they know that you saw it here nareva.com
[02:23:11.080 --> 02:23:13.560]   slash
[02:23:13.560 --> 02:23:15.160]   twit
[02:23:15.160 --> 02:23:18.760]   So the st. Louis post dispatch reporters looking at the
[02:23:18.760 --> 02:23:21.800]   uh
[02:23:21.800 --> 02:23:23.800]   government website for social
[02:23:23.800 --> 02:23:26.200]   social for school teachers
[02:23:26.200 --> 02:23:29.240]   And notices
[02:23:29.240 --> 02:23:32.520]   This is the state's department of elementary and secondary education
[02:23:32.840 --> 02:23:35.000]   Notice is that if he views a source
[02:23:35.000 --> 02:23:38.280]   You all know how to do that right view source on the site
[02:23:38.280 --> 02:23:47.880]   The social security numbers of department employees teachers administrators and councils counselors are completely in the clear viewable in text
[02:23:47.880 --> 02:23:51.000]   No problem at all
[02:23:51.000 --> 02:23:57.400]   Hundreds of thousands of social security numbers revealed so the st. Louis post dispatched as the right thing
[02:23:57.400 --> 02:24:00.440]   They reported having found a bug in the app
[02:24:01.560 --> 02:24:05.160]   Uh, they waited until it was fixed to publish the report didn't matter because
[02:24:05.160 --> 02:24:08.360]   governor mike paris and of uh, mrs
[02:24:08.360 --> 02:24:11.480]   Wants to prosecute the journalist who found the bug
[02:24:11.480 --> 02:24:14.280]   He says he's a hacker
[02:24:14.280 --> 02:24:19.320]   And has vowed criminal prosecution for viewing source
[02:24:19.320 --> 02:24:22.520]   If you ask me
[02:24:22.520 --> 02:24:24.520]   The kind did the state of favor
[02:24:24.520 --> 02:24:27.000]   And he reported it responsibly
[02:24:28.120 --> 02:24:30.920]   This is uh ignorance can really lead to problems
[02:24:30.920 --> 02:24:36.120]   Yeah, I mean, I don't know if it's funny or just sad sad
[02:24:36.120 --> 02:24:45.800]   His story because I mean clearly you have someone in a position of immense power that just doesn't understand basic modern technology
[02:24:45.800 --> 02:24:49.720]   And you know has the state's criminal justice
[02:24:49.720 --> 02:24:52.600]   System which we were just talking about behind them
[02:24:52.600 --> 02:24:55.160]   And you know, I don't think this is going to go anywhere
[02:24:55.560 --> 02:25:00.600]   But how many resources if you get a call from the governor and you're in the state police
[02:25:00.600 --> 02:25:06.520]   You you you you know, you you say yes. Yes governor. We'll look at that, but clearly
[02:25:06.520 --> 02:25:09.240]   This is just sad
[02:25:09.240 --> 02:25:14.680]   And the problem is is that it's even if it's even if he's exonerated the cost of the
[02:25:14.680 --> 02:25:19.160]   Legal case is going to be a thing like even if the governor loses it's going to cost him somewhere between
[02:25:19.160 --> 02:25:22.520]   10 and a hundred thousand dollars, you know, that's the fine
[02:25:23.000 --> 02:25:27.080]   For the governor putting his thumb down if it actually goes anywhere because you're going to have to you know
[02:25:27.080 --> 02:25:29.240]   Go out and get a lawyer and pay them a you know
[02:25:29.240 --> 02:25:33.000]   A retainer and then there's hours and those are only two or three hundred dollars an hour
[02:25:33.000 --> 02:25:36.200]   And the mistake you'll make is that you'll say i'm not going to hire a very good lawyer
[02:25:36.200 --> 02:25:41.240]   And because because I i'm obviously going to win and then you lose and now things get real ugly
[02:25:41.240 --> 02:25:46.680]   You know and so so the the issue is is that you know them just making these like it seems like oh, yeah
[02:25:46.680 --> 02:25:51.960]   He'll get off but yeah, he's going to get off after spending tens of thousands of dollars and on a journalist salary
[02:25:52.360 --> 02:25:58.200]   To defend himself against something that's stupid not to mention the chilling effect because the next reporter comes along and finds
[02:25:58.200 --> 02:26:03.080]   A massive flaw in a state database is sure as hell not gonna tell anybody
[02:26:03.080 --> 02:26:05.640]   Hopefully is hopefully is
[02:26:05.640 --> 02:26:09.000]   Right. Yeah, that's what they want. They want to be able to intimidate
[02:26:09.000 --> 02:26:13.880]   Both from embarrassing. There's no flaws. That was embarrassing stop it. Yes. Yes
[02:26:13.880 --> 02:26:18.680]   Or we'll punish you or we'll punish you. That's a very good point. The legal system is often a weapon. Yeah
[02:26:19.560 --> 02:26:24.120]   Uh, this could be I don't know if we're president setting because it was a court ruling in the UK
[02:26:24.120 --> 02:26:26.120]   But it's an interesting court ruling
[02:26:26.120 --> 02:26:27.720]   john woodward
[02:26:27.720 --> 02:26:31.960]   Uh, who lives in tem oxfordshire was concerned about
[02:26:31.960 --> 02:26:35.720]   Masked men attempting to steal vehicles in his neighborhood
[02:26:35.720 --> 02:26:40.280]   Installed a ring video doorbell and some ring doorbells a camera's around his house
[02:26:40.280 --> 02:26:43.320]   Uh, he lives across the street
[02:26:43.320 --> 02:26:48.440]   From one dr. Fairhost. Here's a picture of this is we'll use this in court
[02:26:48.600 --> 02:26:51.160]   Here's woodward's house. Here's fairhurst's house
[02:26:51.160 --> 02:26:58.360]   Uh, dr. Fairhurst said mary fairhurst said it's harassment. She was forced to move out of her house
[02:26:58.360 --> 02:27:01.480]   Because of the intrusive internet connected
[02:27:01.480 --> 02:27:03.560]   Gadgets
[02:27:03.560 --> 02:27:06.920]   He fitted four devices around his property to protect his vehicles
[02:27:06.920 --> 02:27:14.760]   The judge was particularly uh upset because of the microphones on these devices which would apparently
[02:27:14.760 --> 02:27:17.480]   Clearly hear whatever was going on
[02:27:18.280 --> 02:27:21.800]   On her property they've lived as neighbors for two decades
[02:27:21.800 --> 02:27:26.200]   She complained about the camera and uh, he got aggressive. So that's why
[02:27:26.200 --> 02:27:28.920]   She went to court
[02:27:28.920 --> 02:27:34.520]   The judge found that he had breached the provisions of the data protection act of 2018 and the gdpr
[02:27:34.520 --> 02:27:38.920]   And dr. mary fairhurst is now entitled to compensation plus
[02:27:38.920 --> 02:27:44.360]   preventing mr. woodward from continuing to breach her rights with his security devices
[02:27:45.800 --> 02:27:51.400]   Fair claim. I mean when uh, you know, I love my video doorbell. I have cameras all around the place Chris
[02:27:51.400 --> 02:27:55.800]   They don't pick up audio from our neighbors and they can't really see in the neighbor's yard
[02:27:55.800 --> 02:28:00.040]   But if you live very close to somebody very likely cameras do
[02:28:00.040 --> 02:28:04.200]   It's I think it's also really complicated because the police are actually encouraging people to
[02:28:04.200 --> 02:28:11.000]   Install rings ring does deals with local police. That's right. Yeah, so they're like they're they're really trying to push that down the path of like, hey
[02:28:11.000 --> 02:28:15.480]   Uh, you know, uh, this is something we we think you should put in and because it doesn't make
[02:28:15.480 --> 02:28:19.720]   Their job easier when you have when you have video? Well, it's a little I like knowing
[02:28:19.720 --> 02:28:26.120]   Uh, if somebody's at my door who it is. I like knowing if a package was delivered and I can keep an eye on it. I like these things
[02:28:26.120 --> 02:28:30.360]   Uh, but it's true that it doesn't just shoot my property. It shoots a street
[02:28:30.360 --> 02:28:32.920]   And I can even see that across the street
[02:28:32.920 --> 02:28:37.320]   Yeah, I mean, it's a tough ethical issue, you know, we I used again
[02:28:37.320 --> 02:28:40.680]   It's one of those issues that I would talk to my class about when I would teach crime prevention
[02:28:41.160 --> 02:28:48.520]   Um years ago before these cameras were so cheap and inexpensive, you know, there were CCTV cameras that the government would use
[02:28:48.520 --> 02:28:52.200]   You know, I think there's like five million, especially in the UK
[02:28:52.200 --> 02:28:53.880]   So it was kind of surprising
[02:28:53.880 --> 02:28:59.640]   Uh for me to see the ruling coming out of the UK because they have a much longer history with these being everywhere than we do in the states
[02:28:59.640 --> 02:29:01.480]   That's a good point. Yeah
[02:29:01.480 --> 02:29:06.840]   But you know, those those cameras in the UK all run by the state all run by police
[02:29:07.320 --> 02:29:14.600]   And so that you know, those are her last her last vestige of privacy was taken away because there's no probably nowhere else until she goes
[02:29:14.600 --> 02:29:20.920]   She's not at her camera. Yeah. Yeah. Well, and that's the thing, you know, you were saying lee, oh, I live in an area where we're
[02:29:20.920 --> 02:29:26.440]   Um, if I put a camera, I don't have one on my front door just for this reason because it would be picking up
[02:29:26.440 --> 02:29:34.120]   Um, my neighbors across the streets doors and multiple doors and their front windows and whether they had them open or not
[02:29:34.120 --> 02:29:41.160]   And I have a fairly busy street not not terribly busy, but it will probably go off and detect the motion of the cars
[02:29:41.160 --> 02:29:49.240]   Um every few minutes every 10 minutes something like that. So, you know, I I think this could be a little bit if it stands
[02:29:49.240 --> 02:29:52.920]   Um, and if the fine stands this could be
[02:29:52.920 --> 02:29:58.600]   The beginning of maybe an inflection point in these the use of these cameras
[02:29:58.600 --> 02:30:02.440]   I mean, maybe they'll have to be technological safeguards. I mean, maybe they'll have to be
[02:30:03.080 --> 02:30:08.200]   Um, you know, uh, blurring effects something in there or maybe only property owners
[02:30:08.200 --> 02:30:15.160]   We'll have to position them in a down position so that they're they're only looking at the the doorway and not straight out
[02:30:15.160 --> 02:30:20.120]   I don't know, but it's definitely bad publicity for ring. I mean, I have to say that this is
[02:30:20.120 --> 02:30:25.400]   When you go after people's pocketbooks, that's when you can really start to change behavior
[02:30:25.400 --> 02:30:30.760]   And I could see people saying, you know, I'm just not going to take the risk of putting this thing up there and getting sued
[02:30:30.840 --> 02:30:34.760]   I mean 100 100 000, um, you know, pounds and again
[02:30:34.760 --> 02:30:39.080]   I'm what got him sued was him getting aggressive when she's asked him to move it
[02:30:39.080 --> 02:30:43.400]   Like he didn't get randomly like she didn't just file a lawsuit like he put up the camera
[02:30:43.400 --> 02:30:49.320]   There was a solution prior to say hey, can you stop that and he wouldn't do it and he got aggressive with her and that's that's usually, you know, they
[02:30:49.320 --> 02:30:51.880]   uh, there's a
[02:30:51.880 --> 02:30:57.320]   Saying in africa. I was I was hanging out with these guys in Zimbabwe and we were talking about something and and they were talking about
[02:30:58.120 --> 02:31:01.000]   The political issuance in bobway and and I said why don't you just overthrow?
[02:31:01.000 --> 02:31:05.880]   Mugabe and he said he said we've been farmers for a thousand years, you know, like, you know, we're shono
[02:31:05.880 --> 02:31:10.280]   We've been farmers for a thousand years and when you're farmer for a thousand when your family's been farming for a thousand years
[02:31:10.280 --> 02:31:14.200]   You know that if you get into a fight with your neighbor, they're still your neighbor tomorrow
[02:31:14.200 --> 02:31:20.600]   Then and I think about that all the time because I really good that's a really good motto
[02:31:20.600 --> 02:31:26.200]   So it was so and so I think about that saying every time someone one of my neighbors does something that i'm like wow
[02:31:26.280 --> 02:31:31.640]   I can't believe they just did that, you know, and I have some great neighbors. I have some not not as great neighbors
[02:31:31.640 --> 02:31:33.240]   and
[02:31:33.240 --> 02:31:37.880]   And all of them but whenever they do something that kind of pops my eyes and where I come from, you know
[02:31:37.880 --> 02:31:43.480]   I would react badly. I just go there's still gonna be my neighbor tomorrow. Yeah, so let's figure this out
[02:31:43.480 --> 02:31:47.960]   So, uh, I'm told out of sync in our chat room says ring can
[02:31:47.960 --> 02:31:52.680]   This was not a feature when I had my ring, but I guess they've added this feature probably for this reason
[02:31:53.080 --> 02:31:57.720]   You can't say I don't want to see video from that you can block out areas and just not have video from there
[02:31:57.720 --> 02:32:02.040]   But those microphones. I don't think there's any way to do that and so those microphones are gonna work
[02:32:02.040 --> 02:32:07.480]   Uh, and you will be you can turn it on and off though. You can decide you're gonna disable it. Yes. You can disable a video you can disable a lot
[02:32:07.480 --> 02:32:08.760]   We actually uh
[02:32:08.760 --> 02:32:13.480]   Does that disable it onto the cloud where ring has access to it or does just disable it for you though?
[02:32:13.480 --> 02:32:18.040]   I think it I think it actually disables the the cameras. I think it actually turns the mic off
[02:32:18.040 --> 02:32:20.120]   Yeah, I have the right I don't have the
[02:32:20.120 --> 02:32:24.920]   And I think you're right. I believe it turns off the cameras mic. Yeah, we actually had that issue. I put in
[02:32:24.920 --> 02:32:31.320]   Some years ago. Remember this john. I put nest cameras. We had or they were the drop cams what they were called everywhere
[02:32:31.320 --> 02:32:38.200]   And they had microphones and uh when staff found out that we could listen in all over the office
[02:32:38.200 --> 02:32:42.840]   Yeah, we we said up the mics are now turned off, right?
[02:32:42.840 --> 02:32:46.280]   Well, they were always turned off. Okay, but we made sure that they understood
[02:32:46.760 --> 02:32:50.200]   We are not but you could you could eavesdrop on conversations and things so
[02:32:50.200 --> 02:32:53.640]   Johnson says he could turn them off. He had to
[02:32:53.640 --> 02:32:59.800]   You can't retroactively turn them on so you can't say no wonder were they talking about last night
[02:32:59.800 --> 02:33:05.640]   Uh one last story before we wrap this up this interesting. We'll talk about this on Mac break weekly. Alex. I'm sure
[02:33:05.640 --> 02:33:09.000]   Apple of course got a lot of attention and a lot of applause
[02:33:09.000 --> 02:33:16.280]   In ios 14 for turning on I think it was 14.5 when they turn on the feature where you could say I don't want this app to track me
[02:33:16.920 --> 02:33:23.000]   However, there has been a benefit to apple as well as a benefit to consumer privacy apples
[02:33:23.000 --> 02:33:25.960]   in-house business their search ads
[02:33:25.960 --> 02:33:28.600]   are now
[02:33:28.600 --> 02:33:30.200]   huge growth
[02:33:30.200 --> 02:33:32.520]   50 they're responsible for 58 percent
[02:33:32.520 --> 02:33:42.440]   Uh of all app downloads resulting from clicking on an advertisement so apple puts ads for apps sells ads for apps in the app store
[02:33:43.480 --> 02:33:47.480]   That number a year ago was 17 percent big growth there
[02:33:47.480 --> 02:33:50.280]   Uh, it is it could mean
[02:33:50.280 --> 02:33:55.960]   According to the financial times five billion dollars in its advertising business this year
[02:33:55.960 --> 02:33:58.360]   20 billion a year within three years
[02:33:58.360 --> 02:34:03.960]   All because apples privacy push has significantly altered the landscape
[02:34:03.960 --> 02:34:08.120]   So you can do a thing that's good for your users and hey we all win
[02:34:08.120 --> 02:34:11.960]   Well, but as a as a user, I really want them to turn off that stuff off
[02:34:11.960 --> 02:34:17.000]   I agree, but I think what's important is apple should probably not be benefiting itself too
[02:34:17.000 --> 02:34:21.640]   I don't think that they're trying I don't know what they're tracking. I mean they're ad their ad solutions
[02:34:21.640 --> 02:34:26.680]   No, they don't have to be tracking but if they but if they make all the other tracking stuff not work
[02:34:26.680 --> 02:34:32.280]   Uh that helps them even if they're not tracking right because it has but not for the information
[02:34:32.280 --> 02:34:35.160]   But not tracking is the right thing to do no matter what I agree
[02:34:35.160 --> 02:34:37.880]   Like it's like you know like so turning off the tracking is the right thing to do
[02:34:37.880 --> 02:34:39.880]   I'd like them to go a step further and not
[02:34:40.280 --> 02:34:44.440]   Not from it. Yes. I mean I should they be in the ad business if they are
[02:34:44.440 --> 02:34:48.920]   Shutting out everybody else's ad business. They're not shutting out other people's ad business
[02:34:48.920 --> 02:34:50.920]   They're just shutting out their ability to track
[02:34:50.920 --> 02:34:57.160]   So this is always my issue. I think google and apple both and facebook benefit from because they have first party data
[02:34:57.160 --> 02:35:01.800]   They have direct data. So it's easy for them to say and we're gonna turn off all that third party tracking
[02:35:01.800 --> 02:35:06.120]   But it is so gross like the third party tracking is just gross like it is
[02:35:06.600 --> 02:35:11.240]   Like it is it is it should not exist like it is it is so bad
[02:35:11.240 --> 02:35:15.160]   It's creepy that it's super creepy like creepy creepy
[02:35:15.160 --> 02:35:19.240]   You know and and the fact that I think most people all x don't even understand what third
[02:35:19.240 --> 02:35:23.800]   Third party tracking really is and what it's doing and I think that that's why they're not
[02:35:23.800 --> 02:35:28.280]   Many people are not offended as offended as they should be but when they see the list
[02:35:28.280 --> 02:35:32.360]   That are being tracked then there's only like oh holy hell. What the hell is this?
[02:35:32.920 --> 02:35:37.560]   It's the triangulation. It's the triangulation of the data that is just abhorrent
[02:35:37.560 --> 02:35:43.640]   Like it's it is it is what you're buying it safe way and where you're buying gas and then how you're going and all your gps data
[02:35:43.640 --> 02:35:49.480]   And then you math back math and all into it and I don't I I guess I'm just missing the boat because I
[02:35:49.480 --> 02:35:52.280]   Technologically litter enough to know about it
[02:35:52.280 --> 02:35:57.880]   But it doesn't bother me. It's just they're gonna show me ads for things that I bought it safe
[02:35:57.960 --> 02:36:03.880]   Yeah, but it's what it could be used for like if someone was outside your bathroom watching you and writing
[02:36:03.880 --> 02:36:06.120]   I understand that but that's not what's happened
[02:36:06.120 --> 02:36:11.320]   It kind of is because what you buy in the pharmacy to use in the bathroom is being tracked
[02:36:11.320 --> 02:36:14.760]   Where you are is being tracked what you're doing with that
[02:36:14.760 --> 02:36:18.840]   And so if you're buying a certain set of whatever type of sanitary
[02:36:18.840 --> 02:36:24.200]   Health care attention to this. Yeah, but they're paying attention like it is that creepy actually
[02:36:24.200 --> 02:36:29.560]   I think that people don't get the amount of information they can take from this triangulated data
[02:36:29.560 --> 02:36:36.200]   Right and the thing is the key point is to let them make that decision, right? I mean that that's what you want is that
[02:36:36.200 --> 02:36:39.720]   You know, we've been tracking people ever since there was you know
[02:36:39.720 --> 02:36:45.400]   There were credit cards credit card companies and other companies data brokers could track your purchases
[02:36:45.400 --> 02:36:48.760]   Throughout your your when you use your credit card
[02:36:49.320 --> 02:36:53.240]   The same could be true for magazine subscriptions or companies that would work with law enforcement
[02:36:53.240 --> 02:36:58.840]   That they would come to to know if you ever had a magazine subscription that they could track back there
[02:36:58.840 --> 02:37:00.680]   So, you know, it's not a new practice
[02:37:00.680 --> 02:37:05.560]   But I think the important thing to to everyone's point is that just people know about it
[02:37:05.560 --> 02:37:11.000]   And maybe if they know about then they can decide whether like you Leo, they don't really care or they really do like
[02:37:11.000 --> 02:37:17.400]   myself that they do care about it because yes, you know, I was helping my mom buy a new phone yesterday and
[02:37:17.800 --> 02:37:22.520]   Um, she had an app and I had to remove the app on her old phone because it was eating up
[02:37:22.520 --> 02:37:24.920]   I don't know what it was doing. It was a word game
[02:37:24.920 --> 02:37:29.000]   But it was eating up like three gigs of space and I'm like, why are you using this?
[02:37:29.000 --> 02:37:31.400]   And then when she she said, I don't know you can get rid of it
[02:37:31.400 --> 02:37:35.800]   So I got rid of it and then when I loaded it back, of course, you got the message
[02:37:35.800 --> 02:37:40.760]   Say this app is tracking you across all these other apps and I'm like, this is a word game
[02:37:40.760 --> 02:37:45.800]   Do you really want this? She's like, no, I don't I just say yes to that every time the message pops up, right?
[02:37:45.960 --> 02:37:51.960]   I'm like, really? Okay, mom. Come on. I clearly I haven't done my job as a proper geek to teach you better
[02:37:51.960 --> 02:37:56.360]   So, you know, we uh, I was able to convince her that maybe she didn't need the app but
[02:37:56.360 --> 02:37:59.640]   Yeah, that's that's probably the right reaction
[02:37:59.640 --> 02:38:04.040]   Folks, we are at a time. I would love to keep going with this great panel
[02:38:04.040 --> 02:38:07.720]   But we'll just have to reconvene another time. Alex Lindsey. We will see you
[02:38:07.720 --> 02:38:13.160]   On tuesday to talk about apples announcements tomorrow should be a lot of fun on mac break weekly
[02:38:13.560 --> 02:38:16.280]   And if people want to make a great cup of chai
[02:38:16.280 --> 02:38:22.840]   They can go to office hours.gov global you can see the the there you can find out what we do with office hours
[02:38:22.840 --> 02:38:28.280]   It's a crazy group of of folks that I mean it's just an incredible collection of people
[02:38:28.280 --> 02:38:33.800]   From all the focus on making fine beverages. No, it's no, no, that's not something that production
[02:38:33.800 --> 02:38:38.120]   It's 24 hours a day of something and there was one hour that we made chai
[02:38:38.120 --> 02:38:41.160]   So the um, but it you know, it's really a lot of
[02:38:41.640 --> 02:38:45.480]   I would say that the only thing that that makes us all the same is that we're curious
[02:38:45.480 --> 02:38:51.160]   So a lot of curious people if I got the the zoom link which you can get by going office hours duck global
[02:38:51.160 --> 02:38:54.040]   Could I just turn it on and leave it on all the time at my house?
[02:38:54.040 --> 02:38:56.920]   So people do yeah, yeah, they they leave it on and then i can date
[02:38:56.920 --> 02:38:59.960]   And then they it's like a radio for for me. It's like radio
[02:38:59.960 --> 02:39:01.320]   I just walk around i'm listening to it
[02:39:01.320 --> 02:39:04.520]   And then and then when I hear something that i'm interested in or if I have a question
[02:39:04.520 --> 02:39:07.880]   I literally just get up and if I have a media question or a production
[02:39:07.880 --> 02:39:10.840]   I don't understand this which but I have to admit I say that but
[02:39:11.160 --> 02:39:14.520]   I was trying to figure out what generator like a I you know, we're in california
[02:39:14.520 --> 02:39:19.880]   So we lose power all the time and and so uh, so I was going to figure out what generator to get from my house
[02:39:19.880 --> 02:39:25.400]   And I went up there and um, uh, and I was like, hey, I'm looking for a i'm looking for a generator
[02:39:25.400 --> 02:39:29.960]   Person in emergency services in illinois just gave me like a here's a generator you need
[02:39:29.960 --> 02:39:33.400]   You're gonna want dual fuel. Here's how to break this thing down. Here's how to you know, like
[02:39:33.400 --> 02:39:39.080]   It's kind of cool way that was that was way better than google like you know, i'm in a brain trust always on brain
[02:39:39.080 --> 02:39:42.680]   Yeah, yeah, it's always on office hours dot globe. I'll see you

[02:42:49.480 --> 02:42:55.640]   But many other geek subjects including yes comic books and I think uh stacey higginbotham's book group
