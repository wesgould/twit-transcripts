[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:33.080]   And one of my heroes, to be honest,
[00:01:33.080 --> 00:01:36.320]   Don is an analyst of the future.
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:38.760]   His book's Growing Up Digital and Growing Up Digital.
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.600]   Really talk about how the world is changing for our young people.

[00:01:53.080 --> 00:01:53.600]   >> Yep.

[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:56.720]   Welcome.
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:58.280]   >> Hey, delighted to be here.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:02.520]   >> Also here another, this is Author Day on Twit.
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:04.000]   Also with us.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   And another guy I've been trying to get on for ages and ages
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:07.960]   and ages.
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.200]   And that is Jeff Jarvis, the author of What Would Google Do?
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:13.400]   And from Buzz Machine.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:17.440]   And a long time media, like me, an old media guy who's found his way
[00:02:17.440 --> 00:02:19.760]   in a new media very successfully.
[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:21.480]   >> I'm delighted to be on with the nicest man

[00:02:25.760 --> 00:02:28.760]   >> The contrast is usually greater when you have Devorak on.
[00:02:28.760 --> 00:02:31.360]   >> Yeah, I try to get cranky people on to make the difference.
[00:02:31.360 --> 00:02:33.400]   Would you like to take that role, Jeff?
[00:02:33.400 --> 00:02:35.320]   >> I'll let Don do that.
[00:02:35.320 --> 00:02:36.760]   >> No, everybody here is nice.
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:37.320]   You know what's fun.
[00:02:37.320 --> 00:02:38.360]   >> This Canadian is a nice--
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:40.600]   >> Yeah, Canadians are the kind of people you bump into them
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.880]   on the street and they apologize.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.960]   I mean, an old joke I apologize for.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:48.280]   Also here with Jeff's son, Jake, who
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.720]   is junior in high school, but also a Facebook developer.
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:54.720]   And I brought him on because it's the first time we've
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:56.800]   ever had a father's son team on the show.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:00.320]   But also because he-- I want to talk a little bit about Google
[00:03:00.320 --> 00:03:02.200]   Wave and what from the developer point of view.
[00:03:02.200 --> 00:03:05.720]   And so here's a kid who's also doing a lot of what Don
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:06.960]   Tamscat's been talking about.
[00:03:06.960 --> 00:03:10.000]   It really very much part of the new digital generation.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:12.160]   And the queen of the digital generation
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.480]   is also here with lover Gina Trapani, the life hacker.
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:17.280]   >> Hello.

[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.640]   >> Yep.
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.160]   >> And so it's great to have all of you.
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:29.800]   >> Thanks for having me.
[00:03:29.800 --> 00:03:31.440]   >> Yeah, love having you on Gina.
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:33.200]   You're always-- you're the-- you know,
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:35.040]   I just realized you're the only one who's been on tour before.
[00:03:35.040 --> 00:03:36.720]   So you're going to have to tell these guys
[00:03:36.720 --> 00:03:38.200]   how to run the show, OK?
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:38.960]   >> Excellent.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:39.840]   Very excited.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:42.920]   I actually ditched out on San Diego Bar Camp today
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.280]   to come beyond Twitter.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:46.760]   It was a really good conference, actually.
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:48.320]   >> Oh, I'm so sorry.
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:50.400]   >> No, no, no, it was-- it was fine.
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:51.800]   It was a great weekend.
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:52.680]   It was starting to wind down.
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:54.000]   But I took off after lunch.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.080]   And I had to give a shout out because it was a really cool
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:03:56.560]   conference.
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.760]   So San Diego Bar Camp, yay.
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.720]   >> Well, you know, I was talking with Don before we
[00:04:00.720 --> 00:04:03.240]   began about how everything is changing.
[00:04:03.240 --> 00:04:05.880]   And Bar Camp is an example of how conferences are changing.
[00:04:05.880 --> 00:04:06.280]   >> Yeah.
[00:04:06.280 --> 00:04:07.000]   >> Totally.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:08.600]   >> They're not these hierarchical-- I'll sit,
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.680]   stand on the stage and talk.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:12.880]   You listen, events, they're communal events now.
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:13.280]   >> Yeah.
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:13.640]   >> Right.
[00:04:13.640 --> 00:04:13.920]   Yeah.
[00:04:13.920 --> 00:04:16.680]   And Bar Camp is actually a totally DIY conference.
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.880]   I mean, I was literally with the organizers at Costco
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.320]   on Friday, buying 16 million cases of Coke and Mountain Dew
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:24.440]   and Monster drink.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:26.840]   And the attendees all speak.
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:29.320]   So I talked, and pretty much everyone talked.
[00:04:29.320 --> 00:04:30.520]   And it was a really good time.
[00:04:30.520 --> 00:04:32.920]   >> Personally, as someone who's on the rubber chicken
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:36.760]   circuit getting big speakers fees, I oppose this whole.
[00:04:36.760 --> 00:04:38.160]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:40.080]   Totally.
[00:04:40.080 --> 00:04:41.640]   >> Well, everyone gets in for free.
[00:04:41.640 --> 00:04:42.720]   Everyone speaks for free.
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:45.960]   But it's a really cool place to try out a talk for the first
[00:04:45.960 --> 00:04:49.560]   time or just kind of get goofy.
[00:04:49.560 --> 00:04:52.480]   They don't ask for talks on technology necessarily.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:54.080]   There were all sorts of talks.
[00:04:54.080 --> 00:04:55.600]   So it's a good time.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.720]   >> I learned from the feet of Dave Weiner, who yelled at me
[00:04:57.720 --> 00:04:59.640]   once when I was on a panel at BloggerCon.
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:02.560]   And he said, "Devic Jarvis, there is no panel.
[00:05:02.560 --> 00:05:03.760]   The room is the panel."
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.360]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:05:06.360 --> 00:05:08.480]   He was right as you and as Dave usually is.
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:11.360]   >> Is it just a bunch of old hippies now who finally,
[00:05:11.360 --> 00:05:14.120]   after 40 years, we finally got to--
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:16.400]   >> Well, I just did a review of a book.
[00:05:16.400 --> 00:05:19.520]   It's actually online today at the Globe of Mail.
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:23.040]   It's a book called Lost in Cyberbia.
[00:05:23.040 --> 00:05:26.680]   And this guy in London makes this argument that everything
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:30.680]   that's happening today is the result of Norman Wiener's
[00:05:30.680 --> 00:05:34.480]   original creation of cybernetics.
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.120]   >> Norbert Wiener.
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:36.680]   >> Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:05:36.680 --> 00:05:38.880]   >> And I think that's accurate.
[00:05:38.880 --> 00:05:41.920]   But the point that he made was that the people who came in
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:45.160]   behind cybernetics were none other than Stuart Brand and the
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:46.600]   whole Earth catalog.
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:48.960]   And he describes these weird little scenes where
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:52.240]   Douglas Engelbart's showing the mouse for the first time.
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.680]   And Stuart Brand is actually running the camera.
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.320]   >> You're kidding.
[00:05:55.320 --> 00:05:56.800]   I didn't know that.
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.520]   >> Yeah.
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:02.040]   But he basically makes the point that it's all these hippies
[00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:07.200]   and anti-war protesters from the '60s that went on to create
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:08.160]   Silicon Valley.
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:11.640]   And that what we have today is through all these camps
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:13.240]   and so on is an extension of that.
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:15.800]   >> Well, when you say Dave Wiener, I mean, he seems the
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:18.600]   quintessential Berkeley hippie to me.
[00:06:18.600 --> 00:06:20.960]   I mean, I don't know if he is, but he just seems that that's
[00:06:20.960 --> 00:06:22.520]   that spirit, that style.
[00:06:22.520 --> 00:06:25.200]   And that's what Bar Camp, it couldn't be a more hippie than.
[00:06:25.200 --> 00:06:27.080]   And I'm proud to say I'm a hippie.
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:27.560]   >> Yeah.
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:28.800]   >> Well, I was, of course.
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:29.320]   >> Were you?
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:29.720]   >> Oh, yeah.
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:31.640]   I was against the war big time.
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:33.600]   >> Jeff, you were obviously, you still are.
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:34.360]   >> Yeah, I was.
[00:06:34.360 --> 00:06:35.600]   >> You still are a hippie.
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.680]   >> He's quite a hair shorter now.
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:41.200]   >> Jeff, you and I have seen a big transformation in media,
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:42.200]   though.
[00:06:42.200 --> 00:06:47.480]   I mean, we've seen an amazing shift from old media to new media.
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:49.440]   Are you excited by it or is it a little scary?
[00:06:49.440 --> 00:06:51.720]   I mean, a lot of old media types hate it.
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:54.240]   >> It's as they do when they hate me as a result, but--
[00:06:54.240 --> 00:06:55.760]   >> Yeah, you're a train coat.
[00:06:55.760 --> 00:06:57.840]   >> It's a second childhood for me.
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.440]   You know, here with my white beard and white hair, I've learned
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:01.760]   the new ways of a whole new way.
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:05.280]   And I think it's a way to expand media and journalism
[00:07:05.280 --> 00:07:06.320]   in incredible ways.
[00:07:06.320 --> 00:07:07.560]   I got out of a big company.
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.320]   I now teach at the City University of New York
[00:07:09.320 --> 00:07:10.920]   Graduate School of Journalism.
[00:07:10.920 --> 00:07:13.200]   Because I wanted to be involved with young people who were
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:14.400]   going to reinvent news.
[00:07:14.400 --> 00:07:16.320]   I teach, of course, an entrepreneurial journalism
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:19.120]   so that they can even start companies to reinvent it.
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:21.360]   And that's where the innovation is going to come from.
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:22.560]   I kind of learned the hard way.
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:24.280]   It's not going to come from the big old guys.
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:25.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.760]   Well, that kind of leads us to a story one of the week, which
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:31.160]   was the old guys getting together, colluding,
[00:07:31.160 --> 00:07:33.120]   trying to get you to pay for content.
[00:07:33.120 --> 00:07:34.080]   What happened, Jeff?
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:34.760]   What was going on?
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:36.760]   Boy, there was a lot of talk about it on Twitter.
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:39.320]   Jay Rosen and you were going back and forth.
[00:07:39.320 --> 00:07:40.720]   What was the event?
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.400]   >> There was a meeting brought together
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:44.720]   by the newspaper Association of America.
[00:07:44.720 --> 00:07:47.760]   And it probably would have been less suspicious
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:49.080]   if we'd known about it ahead.
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:53.120]   But they got together in a cruddy motel in Chicago area.
[00:07:53.120 --> 00:07:54.480]   That's all they can afford now.
[00:07:54.480 --> 00:07:56.200]   >> It's like the Sopranos.
[00:07:56.200 --> 00:07:57.680]   >> And they were man ways for me.
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:01.880]   >> Yeah, that are trying to start ways to pay for content.
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:04.240]   And I'm not against paying if you can do it.
[00:08:04.240 --> 00:08:06.880]   But I've argued that by trying to pay,
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:10.000]   you put your content behind a wall, you lose Google juice,
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:11.440]   you're out of the conversation.
[00:08:11.440 --> 00:08:14.640]   But these guys are trying to preserve the little they know
[00:08:14.640 --> 00:08:16.240]   of the old world and the new world.
[00:08:16.240 --> 00:08:18.720]   And they don't understand the link economy.
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:20.400]   So I think we're going to see a lot of papers
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.160]   that are going to try to charge.
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:26.080]   I know entrepreneurs who've said, good, please do that,
[00:08:26.080 --> 00:08:29.760]   because it'll kill you sooner and we can come in afterwards.
[00:08:29.760 --> 00:08:31.600]   This young guy, James Kotecki, who did all kinds
[00:08:31.600 --> 00:08:34.080]   of wonderful things during the campaign, made a video saying,
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:36.480]   please charge and then you'll all be gone.
[00:08:36.480 --> 00:08:39.440]   And I'm afraid it's going to hasten their deaths.
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:40.800]   They just don't get it.
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:42.160]   >> No, and I think the other problem is,
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:43.760]   there's an antitrust issue.
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:47.680]   You know, I went and looked up the data on the information
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:51.040]   on the FTC site about what does it mean to be anti-competitive.
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:54.160]   And the very definition of it is to--
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.720]   >> Get it together in a motel in Chicago.
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.640]   >> Right, what a better place to do it.
[00:08:58.640 --> 00:09:01.040]   So they're all going to raise prices and I'm afraid
[00:09:01.040 --> 00:09:02.080]   they're all going to get sued.
[00:09:02.080 --> 00:09:03.600]   >> Yeah. Yeah.
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:05.680]   And what's interesting is how it came out and how public it
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:06.080]   became.
[00:09:06.080 --> 00:09:08.320]   And this is an example of where Twitter
[00:09:08.320 --> 00:09:11.920]   really exposed this very quickly and got a conversation going.
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:15.040]   As I'm not fond of the conversation on Twitter,
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:17.520]   it's kind of a limited sister situation.
[00:09:17.520 --> 00:09:19.840]   But at least it was there and it was happening.
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.560]   >> James Warren, who used to be an editor of the Chicago Tribune,
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:25.520]   got the entire agenda and he put it up on a blog beforehand
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:26.960]   and then it spread on Twitter like that.
[00:09:26.960 --> 00:09:28.160]   >> Like wildfire, yeah.
[00:09:28.160 --> 00:09:32.320]   >> You know, what this whole thing reminds me of,
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:37.040]   this monetization of content, I just got asked to speak at a conference
[00:09:37.040 --> 00:09:40.400]   on this topic and it's sort of like trying to create a movie
[00:09:40.400 --> 00:09:42.800]   by filming the stage play basically.
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:46.960]   That, you know, these people are trying to take their old model
[00:09:46.960 --> 00:09:51.520]   and just run it on a new platform and get people to pay for it.
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:56.080]   When really, you know, Gannett should have invented the Huffington Post
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:59.440]   and NBC should have invented YouTube and AT&T
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:02.160]   should have invented Twitter and Yellow Pages
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.840]   should have invented Craigslist.
[00:10:03.840 --> 00:10:05.920]   >> It strikes me that's a very difficult thing to do
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:09.920]   because your business model is based around dead trees or whatever
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:12.320]   and it's very hard to change a business model in the middle.
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:13.680]   Gina, you were going to say something, I'm sorry.
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:15.040]   >> Yeah, I mean, I was just going to agree.
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:18.080]   I mean, I think that Clay Shurky's piece on this was so good
[00:10:18.080 --> 00:10:20.640]   and that, I mean, this shouldn't be about preserving a business model.
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:22.880]   It should be about preserving journalism, right?
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:24.560]   And like, how's that going to happen?
[00:10:24.560 --> 00:10:27.440]   >> Yeah, fight for journalism, not for newspapers.
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:28.880]   >> Right, exactly, exactly.
[00:10:28.880 --> 00:10:31.120]   I mean, you know, of course, I feel bad for people
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:32.720]   who are going to lose their jobs and all those things.
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.520]   But I mean, I don't know, it's kind of the laws
[00:10:35.520 --> 00:10:36.160]   of evolution.
[00:10:36.160 --> 00:10:37.360]   >> Are they going to lose their jobs?
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:40.240]   I mean, does it mean they're out of business?
[00:10:40.240 --> 00:10:43.600]   >> Well, a lot are, but I've met with some people last week,
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:46.080]   like Debbie Galant, who runs Bristanette, New Jersey,
[00:10:46.080 --> 00:10:47.600]   and there's 40 people from the Star Ledger
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.440]   who are now starting their own blog.
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:52.640]   I'm running a project in new business models for news.
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:56.160]   I think that hyper-local bloggers and interest bloggers
[00:10:56.160 --> 00:10:57.280]   can make a living at it.
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:11:00.480]   Gina has, TechCrunch has in the tech area,
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.800]   but I think it'll happen in our towns as well.
[00:11:02.800 --> 00:11:04.240]   They're going to be independent agents
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:06.560]   not working for a big company, and that's hard.
[00:11:06.560 --> 00:11:09.440]   But I do think that there's a market demand for journalism,
[00:11:09.440 --> 00:11:11.280]   and the market will meet it.
[00:11:11.280 --> 00:11:13.680]   >> Do they do that by charging for content like the newspapers?
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:14.160]   >> No.
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:14.480]   >> No.
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:34.160]   >> News
[00:11:34.160 --> 00:11:35.200]   that newspapers do.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:37.440]   I don't know.
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.120]   Gawker just had this thing happen this week
[00:11:39.120 --> 00:11:43.840]   where they started selling, they basically sponsored
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:46.800]   a separate blog and was putting posts on Gawker blogs
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:49.280]   that looked like ads but weren't marked as such.
[00:11:49.280 --> 00:11:52.400]   I mean, so there's much experimentation going on
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.040]   and lots of pushing the envelope, but things aren't exactly easy.
[00:11:55.040 --> 00:11:56.240]   I mean, the answer isn't like,
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:57.920]   "Oh, just these little companies spring up,
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:12:00.480]   and there should be bloggers, and the advertising will pay."
[00:12:00.480 --> 00:12:02.000]   I mean, there are a lot of challenges there, too.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:03.360]   I think it's important to remember.
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:05.760]   >> But you're right, Gina, that the cost structure,
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.440]   having 300 people in a newsroom,
[00:12:07.440 --> 00:12:09.680]   a lot of people who just put out the paper
[00:12:09.680 --> 00:12:13.040]   or another movie critic or another golf columnist,
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:16.480]   you have to link economy of the internet,
[00:12:16.480 --> 00:12:17.840]   demands that you specialize,
[00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:19.520]   and then you do something really well
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:21.680]   to do the same stuff everybody else does.
[00:12:21.680 --> 00:12:22.640]   There's no value in that.
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:24.080]   >> Agreed.
[00:12:24.080 --> 00:12:27.600]   >> Yeah, like the one funding model that's of interest
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:32.160]   to preserve the New York Times in its existing form
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:33.840]   is, of course, it had become an NGO.
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.400]   >> A non-governmental organization?
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:39.920]   >> Yeah, like a foundation, and these exist.
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:41.840]   There are foundations that somewhere--
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:42.800]   >> A nonprofit, basically.
[00:12:42.800 --> 00:12:45.920]   >> Yeah, and I think it was Geffen who was trying to--
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.400]   >> He was going to try to buy that, wasn't he?
[00:12:48.400 --> 00:12:49.360]   >> Yeah, he was going to buy it.
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.960]   >> He was going to buy just a couple hundred million,
[00:12:50.960 --> 00:12:54.080]   and the idea was not as an actual investment.
[00:12:54.080 --> 00:12:55.360]   >> But he's a guy.
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:58.080]   I mean, steeped in the whole business world.
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:00.000]   He may not be the right guy to do this, right?
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:00.960]   >> Yeah.
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:04.000]   >> But Don, there was this great quote in the Times
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:06.160]   about a year ago, a young woman in college age,
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:07.920]   a little older than Jake, who said,
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:10.560]   "If the news is that important, it will find me."
[00:13:10.560 --> 00:13:11.280]   >> Right, yeah.
[00:13:11.280 --> 00:13:12.800]   >> And I'm sure you found in your research
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:17.600]   that people just don't have the same magnetic interaction
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:20.000]   with media that they have to go to the site anymore.
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:21.680]   Now they expect the site to come to them.
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:23.920]   >> They want it pushed, not pulled.
[00:13:23.920 --> 00:13:26.640]   You know, I had an amazing experience on this.
[00:13:26.640 --> 00:13:29.520]   I was chairing a panel of young people.
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:30.720]   It was a big crowd.
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:33.840]   It was like, I don't know, 6,000 people in the audience.
[00:13:33.840 --> 00:13:38.320]   And I was sort of talking the kids with these stereotypes
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:39.280]   about their generation.
[00:13:39.280 --> 00:13:41.840]   So I said to this one youngster, by the name of,
[00:13:41.840 --> 00:13:45.920]   by the way, her name is Rahaf Harfush, H-A-R-F-O-U-S-A.
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:46.640]   >> I know Rahaf.
[00:13:46.640 --> 00:13:47.200]   >> Yeah.
[00:13:47.200 --> 00:13:49.680]   And she has a book that comes out tomorrow.
[00:13:49.680 --> 00:13:50.160]   >> Oh, great.
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:51.760]   >> And the book launches in Toronto this week.
[00:13:51.760 --> 00:13:55.360]   I wrote the forward to the book, but she was like 20 years old.
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:57.800]   She was born in Syria.
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:01.600]   She was in Paris studying her boyfriends in Toronto.
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:03.200]   So they turned on Skype all day long
[00:14:03.200 --> 00:14:04.920]   to keep their relationship coming.
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:09.360]   So, and I put a tour about the media.
[00:14:09.360 --> 00:14:11.320]   I said, aren't you the dumbest generation?
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:12.280]   You're ignorant.
[00:14:12.280 --> 00:14:13.480]   You don't read the newspaper.
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:15.200]   You don't watch the TV news.
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:16.760]   You get your news from John Stewart
[00:14:16.760 --> 00:14:19.320]   in the Daily Show on Comedy Central.
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:22.560]   And she says back to me, she says, I don't think that's a fair
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:24.640]   stereotype of my generation.
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:25.840]   I think we're informed.
[00:14:25.840 --> 00:14:26.520]   She says, it's true.
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:28.040]   I don't read the newspaper.
[00:14:28.040 --> 00:14:30.360]   She says, but have you ever seen one of those things?
[00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:33.360]   They come out like once a day and they don't have a hot like.
[00:14:33.360 --> 00:14:34.280]   >> How slow can you get?
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:36.880]   >> You get multimedia and you get this weird black stuff
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.160]   all over your fingers.
[00:14:38.160 --> 00:14:39.320]   >> Have you ever tried one of those?
[00:14:39.320 --> 00:14:42.160]   >> And then she makes this point about the news comes to me
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:45.720]   and she describes, she's got 60 RSS feeds.
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:48.640]   And she says, I like to triangulate the news
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:50.480]   to form my own opinions.
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:52.200]   She says, and it's true.
[00:14:52.200 --> 00:14:54.280]   I watched the Daily Show, but not to get the news.
[00:14:54.280 --> 00:14:56.800]   She says, the Daily Show isn't funny unless you know that.
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:14:58.400]   >> You have to know it a head-to-head.
[00:14:58.400 --> 00:14:59.600]   >> Yeah.
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:02.280]   But here's a generation that's interacting with media
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:03.440]   totally differently.
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:05.840]   >> I can never beat Jake to a story.
[00:15:05.840 --> 00:15:10.080]   >> I was gonna ask Jake, Jake, you're our example.
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:12.320]   Our exemplar of the new generation.
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:14.480]   How do you get your news?
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:16.680]   Do you first of all care about the news?
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:18.960]   >> Yeah, and I figure if something big happens
[00:15:18.960 --> 00:15:21.360]   and I'll hear about it on Twitter first or Facebook
[00:15:21.360 --> 00:15:24.120]   or through a friend, I'll always go to a news site
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:25.920]   or newspaper for more information.
[00:15:25.920 --> 00:15:28.240]   But the big news always comes to me first.
[00:15:28.240 --> 00:15:29.640]   >> Yeah, I'm a friend feed fanatic
[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:32.640]   and it's an aggregator of all of that stuff.
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:34.440]   And it's real time.
[00:15:34.440 --> 00:15:38.040]   It's scrolling up on the screen and it is more efficient,
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:39.880]   but it's not in depth.
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:42.120]   So you do have to then pursue the links down.
[00:15:42.120 --> 00:15:43.640]   And this is the question is,
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.280]   well, who's gonna do the in-depth reporting?
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:47.800]   Who's gonna create the content that all these,
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:49.720]   you know, quick feeds lead to?
[00:15:49.720 --> 00:15:51.960]   Aren't we losing kind of the base,
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:53.280]   the source of all of this stuff?
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:56.200]   If we say, oh, who needs newspapers?
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:57.640]   >> Well, Leo, I think we'll have,
[00:15:57.640 --> 00:15:59.520]   the problem is we assume that you're gonna have
[00:15:59.520 --> 00:16:02.280]   kind of a single new product
[00:16:02.280 --> 00:16:03.600]   replacing the single old product.
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:05.280]   We're not, we're gonna have an ecosystem of news
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:06.640]   with many players.
[00:16:06.640 --> 00:16:08.840]   There'll be hyper local bloggers and interest bloggers
[00:16:08.840 --> 00:16:10.960]   like Gina and there'll be, I believe,
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:13.880]   some level of publicly supported journalism,
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:16.000]   not necessarily taking over the whole New York Times,
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.720]   which I think can still be a business.
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:20.240]   But things like the Huffington Post,
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:24.840]   investigative unit and ProPublica and Spot.us.
[00:16:24.840 --> 00:16:27.920]   >> Does the Huffington Post have an investigative unit come on?
[00:16:27.920 --> 00:16:29.840]   >> Yes, they just got $1.3 million
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:32.040]   and they've hired, they hired away the editor
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:34.280]   in charge of investigations of the Washington Post.
[00:16:34.280 --> 00:16:36.120]   >> Well, that's very encouraging in that case.
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:38.120]   I mean, that's extreme, that's extraordinarily encouraging.
[00:16:38.120 --> 00:16:39.960]   You've seen the site, All Voices.
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:41.160]   This was an interesting idea.
[00:16:41.160 --> 00:16:43.400]   It was kind of an open media site,
[00:16:43.400 --> 00:16:47.040]   encouraging people all around the world to contribute to it.
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:48.440]   I really liked the idea behind it,
[00:16:48.440 --> 00:16:49.440]   but they've had some struggles.
[00:16:49.440 --> 00:16:52.040]   I mean, not all the content has been great on here.
[00:16:52.040 --> 00:16:54.880]   We need some editorial control, don't we?
[00:16:54.880 --> 00:16:56.480]   Or is that old school too?
[00:16:56.480 --> 00:16:58.600]   >> I think it is old school.
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:02.000]   Wikipedia doesn't have editorial control.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:02.840]   >> It's nobody in charge.
[00:17:02.840 --> 00:17:06.560]   >> And there is wisdom in the crowd.
[00:17:06.560 --> 00:17:08.440]   If you set the context right,
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:10.480]   the crowd can be really stupid
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:14.400]   if you don't have the right context as well.
[00:17:14.400 --> 00:17:18.520]   But I wonder about something like the Hough.
[00:17:18.520 --> 00:17:22.280]   This has got a lot of traction now.
[00:17:22.280 --> 00:17:24.760]   And when I write something on the Huffington Post,
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:26.600]   I typically get a better reaction
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:28.480]   than I do if I write The New York Times.
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.200]   >> A smarter reaction and more active.
[00:17:30.200 --> 00:17:31.680]   >> Oh, no, no, just a bigger reaction.
[00:17:31.680 --> 00:17:32.520]   >> Bigger.
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:35.360]   >> And it's a lot savvier too, actually,
[00:17:35.360 --> 00:17:36.960]   if you think about it.
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:39.440]   And it's valuable for me to do that.
[00:17:39.440 --> 00:17:41.800]   I wonder if they could start charging people like me,
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:43.240]   charging the writers.
[00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:44.640]   >> Don't say that.
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:48.200]   >> Don't stop, don't before he kills again.
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:53.680]   >> So Jake, do you then, okay, so you're following Twitter,
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:56.760]   you've seen the headlines, you click through the links
[00:17:56.760 --> 00:17:58.080]   and read the stories in depth.
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:17:59.480]   I mean, do you spend as much time reading
[00:17:59.480 --> 00:18:02.040]   as if you were reading a newspaper?
[00:18:02.040 --> 00:18:02.880]   >> I think so.
[00:18:02.880 --> 00:18:04.840]   I've never really read a newspaper much.
[00:18:04.840 --> 00:18:06.240]   But...
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:08.080]   >> I love it.
[00:18:08.080 --> 00:18:10.640]   >> Yeah, the thing is I can choose what I'm interested in
[00:18:10.640 --> 00:18:14.040]   and read into that as much as I want to.
[00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:15.400]   >> How about this issue, Jake,
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:20.640]   that people say that you're only going to pursue things
[00:18:20.640 --> 00:18:22.640]   that are consistent with your point of view
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:25.480]   and you're not going to get serendipitous other points of view?
[00:18:25.480 --> 00:18:28.320]   What do you say about that?
[00:18:28.320 --> 00:18:30.080]   >> I think it's hard to avoid things
[00:18:30.080 --> 00:18:31.760]   that you don't agree with online.
[00:18:31.760 --> 00:18:33.000]   I mean, you're always going to run into things
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.360]   that don't go with your views.
[00:18:35.360 --> 00:18:36.840]   And I find that interesting.
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:38.000]   I don't know if anyone else is--
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:40.360]   >> I have to confess, though, that I look on "Frenfied"
[00:18:40.360 --> 00:18:43.360]   and I'll block people who are really virulently right-wing
[00:18:43.360 --> 00:18:45.240]   because I'm a virulently left-wing.
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:48.040]   And I do-- it does concern me.
[00:18:48.040 --> 00:18:53.120]   It is important to train people to seek out other opinions.
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:54.920]   What do we have to teach people like Jake
[00:18:54.920 --> 00:18:56.360]   as they grow up in this environment
[00:18:56.360 --> 00:18:57.640]   where we don't have these other--
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:59.240]   there isn't any serendipity?
[00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:00.440]   Or is there? Maybe there is.
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:03.760]   >> Well, I think Jake makes a good point, actually, that--
[00:19:03.760 --> 00:19:06.920]   I mean, like, how do you stay away from Fox News?
[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:08.320]   I mean, it's everywhere. >> Yeah, it's everywhere.
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:11.480]   >> Yeah. >> And I was in Wyoming last week
[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:14.920]   and I met someone who said her parents just turned it on
[00:19:14.920 --> 00:19:16.680]   in the morning and they watch it all day long.
[00:19:16.680 --> 00:19:20.640]   And this might explain why we have some problems in the world.
[00:19:20.640 --> 00:19:24.000]   But, you know, they're gonna bump into it.
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:29.240]   On the other hand, I think that it's a good point that we need to--
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:30.760]   like, this is the first time in history
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:33.960]   when young people are in authority about something really important.
[00:19:33.960 --> 00:19:36.760]   >> We got an 18-year-old-- or is that a teen-year-old on the show?
[00:19:36.760 --> 00:19:37.480]   >> Yeah. >> You know?
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:39.120]   >> I mean, my daughter was just on.
[00:19:39.120 --> 00:19:42.240]   >> I was in authority on model train when I was 11.
[00:19:42.240 --> 00:19:43.320]   >> I was collecting stamps.
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:46.560]   >> Yeah. >> Today, the 11-year-old at the breakfast table
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:49.720]   is an authority on this thing that's changing every institution.
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:52.120]   But just 'cause they're an authority on something
[00:19:52.120 --> 00:19:54.280]   doesn't mean they're an authority on everything.
[00:19:54.280 --> 00:19:58.440]   And there's certain things-- I think that it makes sense
[00:19:58.440 --> 00:20:02.640]   that we would sort of build training programs
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:07.280]   or certain, you know, educational programs into our schools.
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:10.880]   Like, just something like privacy that worries me a lot.
[00:20:10.880 --> 00:20:11.720]   >> Right. >> Right.
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:16.000]   >> And, Don, I think that media literacy isn't just about consuming media now.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:18.800]   It's also about creating media and what happens when you do.
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:19.640]   >> Yeah, that's a great--
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.120]   >> Well, in fact, you can't-- you know,
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:23.040]   if your Facebook's a really good example,
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.840]   you don't just get to sit and passively consume Facebook.
[00:20:25.840 --> 00:20:28.360]   If you don't contribute to it, you've got nothing.
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:30.480]   Modern media like Twitter, Facebook, and so forth
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:34.360]   requires participation as much as consumption.
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:35.400]   I love that. >> Exactly.
[00:20:35.400 --> 00:20:36.840]   It's the only way you connect to people.
[00:20:36.840 --> 00:20:39.160]   >> Yeah, I love that. >> You can't connect unless you reveal
[00:20:39.160 --> 00:20:40.120]   something of yourself.
[00:20:40.120 --> 00:20:42.400]   And that scares people my age with their young people,
[00:20:42.400 --> 00:20:44.080]   but that's how they interact.
[00:20:44.080 --> 00:20:46.000]   And I think it actually will be healthy
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:49.440]   because they'll be connected with friends for the rest of their lives.
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:50.760]   >> You know, I see a lot of parents who say,
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:53.880]   "I'm going to keep my kids off of these social networks
[00:20:53.880 --> 00:20:55.760]   because of this fear of privacy."
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:57.520]   And at the same time, I think it's really--
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:21:00.600]   this is-- you know, my wife didn't want my son to be on MySpace.
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:01.920]   He's 14.
[00:21:01.920 --> 00:21:03.400]   And I said, "Well, what were you doing on your 14?
[00:21:03.400 --> 00:21:04.520]   Were you on the phone all the time?"
[00:21:04.520 --> 00:21:05.560]   She said, "Yeah."
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:07.000]   So, "Well, this is his phone.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:08.600]   This is how he communicates with his peers."
[00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:10.800]   The other thing is just sit down with the kid
[00:21:10.800 --> 00:21:16.360]   and work through the privacy settings on Facebook.
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:17.720]   >> Isn't privacy dead?
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:19.560]   >> No, I hope it isn't.
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:22.160]   Because I think it's a big problem
[00:21:22.160 --> 00:21:24.960]   if we lose our informational privacy.
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:28.880]   You know, like, increasingly as we spend time online,
[00:21:28.880 --> 00:21:31.840]   this is not just a way of communicating with others,
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:34.280]   the basis for work and learning and health care
[00:21:34.280 --> 00:21:37.680]   and entertainment and social discourse and so on.
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:40.400]   >> We're kind of leaving this trail of digital crumbs
[00:21:40.400 --> 00:21:42.080]   and these things are being collected
[00:21:42.080 --> 00:21:45.480]   into a mirror image of each of us, the virtual Leo.
[00:21:45.480 --> 00:21:49.280]   >> Yeah, the data smog, the stuff that's trailing off of me
[00:21:49.280 --> 00:21:50.680]   as I go through the world.
[00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:53.720]   >> And the virtual Leo may know more about you than you do
[00:21:53.720 --> 00:21:56.920]   because you can't remember what you bought or consumed
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:59.360]   or said or whatever a year ago.
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:05.360]   And, you know, that right now, I think there are thousands
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:08.640]   of young people not getting that dream job in the world
[00:22:08.640 --> 00:22:12.720]   this year because they failed the quote reference jack.
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:14.320]   >> But I also think, Don, that there are people
[00:22:14.320 --> 00:22:17.000]   who are discovering connecting with people they wouldn't
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:18.200]   have connected with otherwise.
[00:22:18.200 --> 00:22:20.200]   The discussion so much is about privacy
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:22.480]   when I think it should be about control of your data.
[00:22:22.480 --> 00:22:26.440]   I agree there, but the benefits of publicness are great.
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:28.920]   And, you know, it was Eric Schmidt who said that we all ought
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:31.840]   to be able to change our names at age 21 and start over.
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:34.320]   I think at some point we have kind of a doctrine
[00:22:34.320 --> 00:22:36.120]   of mutually assured humiliation.
[00:22:36.120 --> 00:22:39.320]   [ Laughter ]
[00:22:39.320 --> 00:22:42.400]   >> But the trouble is that you can't right now.
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:44.720]   I mean, I had this debate with my own son and he said,
[00:22:44.720 --> 00:22:48.200]   Dad, by the time, you know, I come into the workforce,
[00:22:48.200 --> 00:22:50.200]   we're going to be running things and the fact
[00:22:50.200 --> 00:22:52.680]   that I was underage drinking or wearing a dress
[00:22:52.680 --> 00:22:56.320]   at a party or something is not getting the reason to.
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:59.120]   But there's a big, this is going to take that case.
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:00.960]   >> It happened in the gatitudes.
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:05.920]   >> It happened in the presidency, you know, a few years ago,
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:09.520]   you could not lose a nomination because you smoked pot.
[00:23:09.520 --> 00:23:12.760]   I don't think that that's going to be a criterion going forward.
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:14.840]   >> It takes a long time.
[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:18.480]   The other thing is that information about you
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:21.160]   in a highly detailed way can be manipulated.
[00:23:21.160 --> 00:23:22.920]   >> Yeah. But everything can be manipulated.
[00:23:22.920 --> 00:23:25.760]   I mean, we've learned nothing is real anymore.
[00:23:25.760 --> 00:23:27.640]   >> But you can be manipulated.
[00:23:27.640 --> 00:23:28.920]   I guess that's really the point.
[00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:31.240]   Like, you know, there are cases of, you know,
[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:34.760]   a guy shows up for the job, but he failed the reference check.
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:38.680]   And what happened is that his employer got access
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:41.320]   to medical records, found out that he had been treated
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:43.040]   for depression or something like that.
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:43.800]   >> That would be bad.
[00:23:43.800 --> 00:23:45.920]   >> So there's certain things that we have a right
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:47.200]   to have private.
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:48.560]   >> Jake, what do you do?
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:51.680]   Do you have a Facebook profile that you post pictures
[00:23:51.680 --> 00:23:53.200]   of you partying on?
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:54.240]   >> No.
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.680]   >> Dad's taught you not to do that,
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:23:58.880]   or did you figure that out on your own?
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:00.720]   >> I mean, I just don't put anything up there
[00:24:00.720 --> 00:24:02.160]   that I don't want other people to see.
[00:24:02.160 --> 00:24:04.200]   >> So you have, do you think that your peers have
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:05.880]   that sense as well that they realize
[00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:07.160]   that this stuff lives forever?
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:08.840]   They probably know better than we do, Don.
[00:24:08.840 --> 00:24:11.840]   >> Yeah. I think they're self-correcting now, like,
[00:24:11.840 --> 00:24:14.600]   at parties, you know, this is a no, no,
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:16.320]   Facebook photo party that I can't say.
[00:24:16.320 --> 00:24:19.160]   >> There was a very funny onion video the other day
[00:24:19.160 --> 00:24:21.560]   about a fire at an NYU dorm.
[00:24:21.560 --> 00:24:23.200]   And they figured out who caused the fire
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:26.000]   because there were 40,000 pictures, 30,000 videos.
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.680]   Every, it was documented in full detail.
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:31.520]   >> And they had 20,000 shots of the cigarette
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:33.640]   following the cause of the fire.
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:34.480]   >> Exactly.
[00:24:34.480 --> 00:24:35.920]   We had to look around the co-eds who were kissing
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:37.520]   or, you know, posing for the camera,
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:39.040]   the guy who was showing his tattoo.
[00:24:39.040 --> 00:24:40.400]   But it was all their document.
[00:24:40.400 --> 00:24:41.640]   And that was a very funny video,
[00:24:41.640 --> 00:24:43.400]   but I think maybe a little bit true.
[00:24:43.400 --> 00:24:45.760]   We are talking about all sorts of stuff.
[00:24:45.760 --> 00:24:47.160]   We're going to talk about Google in just a little bit,
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:51.800]   and the new wave with Gina Trapani, the life hacker,
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:53.120]   and the smarterware.org.
[00:24:53.120 --> 00:24:55.160]   Don Tapscott is here, grown up digital,
[00:24:55.160 --> 00:24:56.440]   that's his latest book.
[00:24:56.440 --> 00:24:59.560]   Jeff Jarvis, the author of "What Would Google Do?"
[00:24:59.560 --> 00:25:01.080]   His latest book in the media,
[00:25:01.080 --> 00:25:03.720]   Wizard from Buzzmachine.com, and his son,
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:06.880]   Jake, who is one of the, believe it or not,
[00:25:06.880 --> 00:25:10.320]   as a junior in high school, a premier Facebook developer.
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:12.240]   And I love that.
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:13.160]   We're going to talk about that in a second.
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:14.000]   We're going to take a break though,
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:15.640]   and talk about Go To Meeting.
[00:25:15.640 --> 00:25:16.680]   You know, it's kind of fitting today
[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:20.760]   that we're spending a lot of time talking about collaboration
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:23.840]   because that's what Go To Meeting is all about.
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:28.320]   You know, the old way of doing business really is,
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:30.680]   well, was meeting in person.
[00:25:30.680 --> 00:25:32.640]   Then the kind of guy, we got to conference calls,
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:35.840]   but the last time you were at a conference call,
[00:25:35.840 --> 00:25:39.040]   boring, unproductive, just, you know,
[00:25:39.040 --> 00:25:41.120]   they feel like they're a waste of time.
[00:25:41.120 --> 00:25:44.280]   Somebody goes off track, people lose interest,
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:46.840]   they disengage, they're playing Tetris,
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:49.920]   they're typing Twitter, they're emailing.
[00:25:49.920 --> 00:25:51.280]   And at the end, you feel like,
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:52.720]   I thought it was a waste of time.
[00:25:52.720 --> 00:25:54.360]   This is where Go To Meeting can really help.
[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:57.760]   Go To Meeting because they're seeing your computer screen
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:00.200]   keeps people on track during the conference calls.
[00:26:00.200 --> 00:26:03.000]   They're on literally the same page, your page.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.480]   Everyone on the call sees your screen,
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:06.480]   they're following along with you.
[00:26:06.480 --> 00:26:11.080]   The call is more focused, more interesting, more engaging.
[00:26:11.080 --> 00:26:12.480]   And that means you're going to save time,
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:13.400]   you're going to be more productive,
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:14.920]   and you're not going to leave these meetings going,
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:16.920]   why did we do that again?
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:18.520]   Go To Meeting.
[00:26:18.520 --> 00:26:21.200]   Very simple to install, just take you a couple of minutes,
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.520]   couple of clicks of the mouse.
[00:26:22.520 --> 00:26:25.320]   In fact, if you go right now to gotomeeting.com/twit,
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:29.400]   g-o-t-o-meeting.com/twit,
[00:26:29.400 --> 00:26:32.560]   you can install it and try it for 30 days, absolutely free.
[00:26:32.560 --> 00:26:35.920]   Great for sales presentations, for product demos,
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:37.800]   for training, collaboration,
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:39.520]   that's mostly how we use it.
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:41.960]   We also use it on one of our Maximal's house on our podcast,
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:42.920]   we use Go To Meeting all the time,
[00:26:42.920 --> 00:26:44.920]   we get that great screen he can show us.
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:46.720]   As he's talking to us about stuff,
[00:26:46.720 --> 00:26:47.560]   we could see the slides,
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:50.200]   see the key we heard is the slides actually.
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:53.960]   For weekly update calls, any kind of conference
[00:26:53.960 --> 00:26:57.440]   called Go To Meeting, it is changing the way I do business,
[00:26:57.440 --> 00:26:58.440]   and I think you're going to love it,
[00:26:58.440 --> 00:26:59.360]   I want you to try it free.
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:03.520]   Go to gotomeeting.com/twit, for 30 days free,
[00:27:03.520 --> 00:27:07.520]   and the folks at Citrix, gotomeeting.com/twit.
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:11.680]   So let's get back to the conversation.
[00:27:11.680 --> 00:27:13.760]   Boy, I hate to interrupt this, this could go on online,
[00:27:13.760 --> 00:27:16.520]   this is a great group of people to talk about this stuff,
[00:27:16.520 --> 00:27:20.600]   but there was a big conference this week,
[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:23.000]   and it's kind of funny,
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.440]   there were two big announcements this week,
[00:27:25.440 --> 00:27:29.600]   Microsoft announced a new search engine called Bing,
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:31.560]   which everybody went, looked at,
[00:27:31.560 --> 00:27:32.880]   and then immediately forgot about
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:35.520]   because Google had all these big announcements.
[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:36.360]   (laughing)
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:37.440]   Is there any story left?
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:38.920]   I mean, is Bing a big deal?
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:41.480]   Anybody wanna defend Bing?
[00:27:41.480 --> 00:27:43.880]   Gina, is it the hottest things since Google?
[00:27:43.880 --> 00:27:47.360]   - Well, I think I'd like to try it first.
[00:27:47.360 --> 00:27:50.320]   Well, for a search engine, composition, I think it's good.
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:52.520]   I think that there need to be better search engines
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:54.440]   or decision engines or whatever we're calling it
[00:27:54.440 --> 00:27:55.280]   in the days that-- - Yeah, he don't call it
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:56.360]   at a search engine.
[00:27:56.360 --> 00:27:57.200]   - Right, right.
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:58.160]   Well, first thing we had Wolfworm right,
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:00.080]   which is the computational knowledge engine,
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:01.400]   and now we have a decision engine.
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:04.160]   Either way, I have to say what I saw Bing looks cool.
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:06.320]   I mean, I'm certainly not gonna review a product
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:07.320]   without trying it myself,
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:09.160]   but I think that competition is good.
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:10.640]   It's a few years late.
[00:28:10.640 --> 00:28:13.040]   I mean, Microsoft has tried this a few times, right?
[00:28:13.040 --> 00:28:15.720]   So we'll see what happens.
[00:28:15.720 --> 00:28:18.560]   I mean, thank goodness it's not alive something or other.
[00:28:18.560 --> 00:28:21.320]   At least they came up with a different hand.
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:22.640]   - Enough of the live Microsoft.
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:24.240]   When you actually do something live,
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:27.000]   then you can name it live and we won't get excited.
[00:28:27.000 --> 00:28:27.920]   - Right.
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:30.160]   - Unfortunately, Microsoft chose the word live
[00:28:30.160 --> 00:28:34.080]   as it's branding at a time when in fact,
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:35.920]   everything really was going live,
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:39.480]   and the stuff that they were using to brand live wasn't.
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:40.320]   - Right.
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:41.760]   - Kind of was ironic that way.
[00:28:41.760 --> 00:28:46.320]   Bing will be a success when people say,
[00:28:46.320 --> 00:28:48.560]   "I'm gonna Bing that instead of I'm gonna Google that."
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:50.720]   And that day is never gonna come, I'm sorry.
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.920]   - Yeah, I have a hard time thinking that's gonna come,
[00:28:52.920 --> 00:28:55.560]   but again, I'm yay competition,
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:28:57.120]   so I'm really hoping that it's good.
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:28:57.960]   - Rob Rob.
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:58.800]   - Rob Rob.
[00:28:58.800 --> 00:28:59.640]   - Yeah.
[00:28:59.640 --> 00:29:01.640]   - I think Leo that search was yesterday's battle
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:04.280]   and the frontiers to be fought still are social
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:06.840]   and live and local in the deep web,
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:08.400]   and you're gonna get to it in a second,
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:09.640]   but I think that with Wave,
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:11.600]   they just jumped ahead of the old battles
[00:29:11.600 --> 00:29:12.760]   to the new battle route.
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:14.400]   - I couldn't agree with you more.
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:17.880]   - Well, I think the reason that everyone got excited
[00:29:17.880 --> 00:29:21.400]   about Wave is that one company announced a product,
[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:23.040]   the other announced a platform
[00:29:23.040 --> 00:29:24.720]   whereby others could participate.
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:25.720]   - Boy, is that changed.
[00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:29.440]   - And that's the old versus the new paradigm.
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:31.200]   By the way, urban dictionary,
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:34.600]   it can't have been a coincidence.
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:36.640]   The day that Bing was announced came out
[00:29:36.640 --> 00:29:39.960]   with a urban slang meaning of the word Bing.
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:40.800]   Do you know what it is?
[00:29:40.800 --> 00:29:42.040]   - Oh, I hate to think what?
[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:42.880]   - Jail.
[00:29:42.880 --> 00:29:43.720]   - Jail.
[00:29:43.720 --> 00:29:45.040]   - Yeah, I'm in Bing.
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:49.120]   - Yeah, I've been in Bing for the last 18 months
[00:29:49.120 --> 00:29:50.280]   for a B&E.
[00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:51.640]   - Great.
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:53.840]   - I'm in Bing 'cause I stole some bling.
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:56.200]   (laughing)
[00:29:56.200 --> 00:29:57.040]   - Sorry.
[00:29:57.040 --> 00:29:57.880]   - No, I think that's--
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:29:58.720]   - I thought about it, Bing.
[00:29:58.720 --> 00:29:59.720]   - I think that's a,
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:02.520]   one of the things that's really remarkable about this,
[00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:04.560]   Microsoft could of course, and probably will.
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:05.800]   I mean, they've got SharePoint and Groove,
[00:30:05.800 --> 00:30:07.440]   they'll do something like Wave,
[00:30:07.440 --> 00:30:09.240]   but it will be a commercial product,
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:10.480]   it will be a closed product,
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:12.200]   it'll be a Microsoft product, they'll sell.
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:13.880]   - And it'll be 10 years later?
[00:30:13.880 --> 00:30:16.160]   - Yeah, and it'll be behind the time.
[00:30:16.160 --> 00:30:19.240]   Whereas Google did it exactly right.
[00:30:19.240 --> 00:30:20.880]   They made something that was open,
[00:30:20.880 --> 00:30:22.760]   they invited developers to create Fort,
[00:30:22.760 --> 00:30:25.240]   they said we're gonna allow you to run it on your servers,
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:27.040]   we're gonna allow you to modify it,
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:29.480]   we're gonna give you an API and a protocol.
[00:30:29.480 --> 00:30:32.440]   This is, so you're saying this is the modern way.
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:35.280]   - Yeah, well, the old way is plan and push, right?
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:37.240]   We have all these great developers,
[00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:38.800]   by the way, they're inside our boundaries,
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:40.120]   and we create these great products,
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:41.600]   then we push them out onto the market,
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:42.720]   and you're gonna love them.
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:43.560]   - You eat it or not?
[00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:44.400]   - Yeah.
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.800]   - And the other is, I've been calling it
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:50.280]   Engage and Co-Innovate, that we create a platform,
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:52.480]   we open up the APIs, you know that t-shirt,
[00:30:52.480 --> 00:30:54.680]   if you can't open it, you don't own it,
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:58.920]   and we'll engage the world in co-innovating
[00:30:58.920 --> 00:31:00.400]   and co-creating the future,
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:03.760]   and one is the old and the other is the new.
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:05.080]   - Media's the same way, isn't it?
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:07.400]   I mean, media's gone from push,
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:09.240]   we'll find it, we'll report it,
[00:31:09.240 --> 00:31:11.800]   we'll give it, we'll serve it up to you,
[00:31:11.800 --> 00:31:13.280]   and now it's a cooperative effort.
[00:31:13.280 --> 00:31:14.320]   - Well, look at this show.
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:15.160]   - Yeah.
[00:31:15.160 --> 00:31:17.360]   - I think, Leo, that's the important thing about Wave,
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:19.920]   I'm blogged about right before coming on the show,
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:23.200]   is that Google talks about it as the email we would invent
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:24.840]   if we invented email today.
[00:31:24.840 --> 00:31:26.800]   I actually think it's the news we would invent
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:28.000]   as we are inventing news today,
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:31.560]   because I imagine that a bunch of reporters and witnesses
[00:31:31.560 --> 00:31:34.240]   can collaborate on a story using Wave,
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:36.320]   sharing photos and the latest information
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:38.240]   and assignments and questions,
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:39.800]   and they can push that to a webpage,
[00:31:39.800 --> 00:31:41.480]   they can push that to Twitter,
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:44.520]   and it really becomes a new way to publish news.
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:47.080]   I've been talking about how the article is outmoded
[00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:48.880]   as the atomic unit of media.
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:51.760]   Marissa Mayer at the Kerry hearings talked about
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:54.600]   how news organizations need to have a promo link
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:56.160]   for an ongoing story,
[00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:58.920]   but Wave, I think, becomes that,
[00:31:58.920 --> 00:32:01.360]   and that's huge in media,
[00:32:01.360 --> 00:32:04.560]   so Wave is more than just communication and collaboration,
[00:32:04.560 --> 00:32:08.200]   it's that, but it's also an entirely new way, as Don says,
[00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:13.000]   to engage and collaborate and do it live and to publish.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.840]   - Yeah, I mean, once that thing is out there,
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:17.160]   then people can interact with it.
[00:32:17.160 --> 00:32:19.640]   - You know what, I think this bodes very well for Wave.
[00:32:19.640 --> 00:32:21.080]   You know, I had the same reaction, Jeff,
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:22.480]   as a media guy, I thought,
[00:32:22.480 --> 00:32:24.120]   oh, this is great, I could put the Twitter video
[00:32:24.120 --> 00:32:26.320]   in the middle and the community that's participating
[00:32:26.320 --> 00:32:28.160]   in this can interact and create a rounded,
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:29.680]   it's got features of a wiki,
[00:32:29.680 --> 00:32:30.920]   features of instant messaging,
[00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:34.040]   features of actual messaging,
[00:32:34.040 --> 00:32:36.880]   and then now you have another application for Jeff,
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:39.360]   and I think the measure of the success of this
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:41.280]   is that it's seen in many different ways,
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:43.920]   depending on your point of view, much like the internet,
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:45.120]   the fact that it could be a prism
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:46.480]   for what your points of view are,
[00:32:46.480 --> 00:32:48.360]   and it can be a collaborative tool,
[00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:49.640]   I mean, if you're in business,
[00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:51.240]   think of a small business being able to,
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:53.440]   I think of the projects that we work on here
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:54.360]   to be able to work on it,
[00:32:54.360 --> 00:32:56.360]   and that kind of environment's fantastic.
[00:32:56.360 --> 00:32:58.440]   - You really have, we win online,
[00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:00.040]   the biggest lesson of Google, I think,
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:02.720]   in creating platforms is that when you lose control
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:05.120]   of something, when people surprise you and take it over,
[00:33:05.120 --> 00:33:06.880]   that's when you really won,
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:09.720]   as opposed to the old centralized big media
[00:33:09.720 --> 00:33:11.560]   and corporate way of looking at life
[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:14.240]   is that you thought your value was in controlling something,
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:16.040]   no, your value now is in losing control.
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:18.400]   - Again, it's that hierarchical, we know you don't,
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:20.520]   we'll tell you, you sit down and shut up and take it,
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:22.400]   you consume it.
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:24.800]   I think in a way you made that point, didn't you, Jeff,
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:27.600]   when you said Google may not even understand what this is,
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:30.360]   they're putting something out that they think is email.
[00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:31.200]   - Exactly.
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:32.480]   - Craig Newmark, when he made Craigslist,
[00:33:32.480 --> 00:33:34.680]   didn't know that it was going to, you know,
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:36.840]   destroy the business model of newspapers as we know them
[00:33:36.840 --> 00:33:39.720]   and people would use it after Katrina to find each other.
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:41.320]   I think that Google's putting stuff out
[00:33:41.320 --> 00:33:43.560]   with the exact hope they set it off
[00:33:43.560 --> 00:33:46.920]   and in their long one hour and 20 minute fascinating demo
[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:49.920]   that we want you to take this over and surprise us.
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:52.240]   - The term that's used commonly is generative,
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:54.000]   this is a generative project.
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:33:57.920]   They also put out web elements
[00:33:57.920 --> 00:33:59.600]   and I think that's important for media as well,
[00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:02.080]   I've been talking about trying to make news organizations
[00:34:02.080 --> 00:34:04.960]   embedable, what if you could embed on my blog
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.480]   or yours more than just a video,
[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:09.240]   but also an article with a quote highlighted
[00:34:09.240 --> 00:34:12.040]   or a graphic or photos or anything else.
[00:34:12.040 --> 00:34:15.200]   I think that web elements from Google enables that.
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:16.960]   I saw APSUR this week,
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:19.600]   I think they can enable that, APIs enable that.
[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:21.800]   So it's also, while some newspapers are now trying
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:23.960]   to shut their stuff down around the paywall,
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:25.360]   the smart ones like the Guardian
[00:34:25.360 --> 00:34:27.200]   are trying to get their stuff out there.
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:29.720]   And I think elements and wave become new ways
[00:34:29.720 --> 00:34:31.880]   to also distribute your content.
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:32.960]   - Go ahead, Gina.
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:35.560]   - Yeah, I was gonna say that as a user
[00:34:35.560 --> 00:34:36.920]   and a developer and a blogger,
[00:34:36.920 --> 00:34:38.080]   I'm totally excited about Wave.
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:41.400]   I took the time to watch the entire hour and 20 minute demo
[00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:43.560]   and I was just absolutely blown away.
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:45.360]   I'm especially excited that it's open source
[00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:47.920]   following on Android and Chrome, which is really kind of awesome.
[00:34:47.920 --> 00:34:50.040]   When you think about the culture of secrecy at Google,
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:52.640]   like it's really cool to see them put this stuff out there.
[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:53.480]   I was really excited about,
[00:34:53.480 --> 00:34:54.600]   I don't know if you guys saw this part,
[00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:56.360]   but the Google Web Toolkit,
[00:34:56.360 --> 00:35:00.080]   which they use to actually build the app is super cool.
[00:35:00.080 --> 00:35:00.960]   It's like a Java,
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:02.280]   you write the app in Java,
[00:35:02.280 --> 00:35:03.280]   which I was really excited about,
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:04.120]   'cause I'm a Java developer.
[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:07.320]   And then it generates all the Ajax and CSS for you,
[00:35:07.320 --> 00:35:09.240]   just kind of from a developer perspective,
[00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:10.120]   that was super cool.
[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:12.120]   - I immediately ordered a GWT book.
[00:35:12.120 --> 00:35:13.600]   - Yeah, I know, I'm great.
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:14.600]   Exactly, me too.
[00:35:14.600 --> 00:35:16.280]   I didn't order the book yet,
[00:35:16.280 --> 00:35:17.960]   but I will do that when we hang up.
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:19.360]   That looked really cool.
[00:35:19.360 --> 00:35:20.200]   But at the same time,
[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:21.520]   oh, and I love that it's federated, right?
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:23.720]   So you can install it on different servers
[00:35:23.720 --> 00:35:27.440]   and the communication that you have on one server
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:29.280]   doesn't necessarily go back to Google.
[00:35:29.280 --> 00:35:30.640]   I thought it was interesting during the demo
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:33.080]   that they kept saying certain parts of this code
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:34.760]   will be open source.
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:35.720]   They didn't say all,
[00:35:35.720 --> 00:35:37.080]   they kept saying certain parts.
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:38.720]   So I'm curious to know how that,
[00:35:38.720 --> 00:35:41.040]   if there will be phoning home or what.
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:44.320]   I mean, they did say that if some company like Life Hacker
[00:35:44.320 --> 00:35:46.480]   has, we've installed on their server
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:48.240]   and private communications happen there,
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:50.120]   that those don't ever go back to servers.
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:51.680]   And that's a good thing, privacy-wise.
[00:35:51.680 --> 00:35:54.120]   - I asked Kevin Marx about that question,
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:56.240]   is how much of you are you gonna open?
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:59.120]   Kevin, of course, is Google's OpenSocial advocate
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:01.440]   and a developer and a very smart guy.
[00:36:01.440 --> 00:36:05.160]   He said, there's technical issues with releasing it all,
[00:36:05.160 --> 00:36:07.440]   but the intent is to make it fully open.
[00:36:07.440 --> 00:36:09.360]   - Well, that's good to hear.
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:10.840]   I also think that you have to have
[00:36:10.840 --> 00:36:12.680]   sort of a healthy amount of skepticism
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:14.040]   about this type of thing as well.
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:17.120]   I mean, Om wrote a piece about how Google Wave
[00:36:17.120 --> 00:36:20.080]   was the product of his dreams as it is for us too,
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:21.680]   but none of us have tried it yet.
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:22.520]   - But let's see it.
[00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:23.360]   - Yeah.
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:24.200]   - But let's see it exactly.
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:25.040]   And what's the business model?
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:26.600]   I think someone else like you go,
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:27.960]   Om also wrote this piece that was like,
[00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:28.800]   what's the business model?
[00:36:28.800 --> 00:36:30.560]   - I mean, I'm really not of the mind that--
[00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:32.600]   - Who cares if Google doesn't need to know
[00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:33.920]   what the business model is.
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:35.280]   Their business is Search.
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:36.120]   - Yeah, I mean--
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:37.840]   - Anything that drives eyeballs is good for Google.
[00:36:37.840 --> 00:36:38.960]   - Yeah, I agree.
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:41.520]   - I mean, advertising/search, yeah.
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:42.680]   - Right, right, I agree.
[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:44.080]   - Search-driven advertising.
[00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:45.440]   - Yeah, they're an ad agency.
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:46.720]   - They're basically an ad agency.
[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:49.560]   So just like this show and anything else,
[00:36:49.560 --> 00:36:51.800]   the more eyeballs, the better.
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:52.640]   That's, you know.
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:53.480]   - Which is definitely--
[00:36:53.480 --> 00:36:56.800]   - At the announcement, I know that they were asked,
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:37:01.040]   the guy's name, I forget, Vic, the Google guy.
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:02.040]   - Yeah.
[00:37:02.040 --> 00:37:03.040]   - Hard last name.
[00:37:03.040 --> 00:37:03.880]   - Yeah.
[00:37:03.880 --> 00:37:04.720]   - Starts with a G.
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:05.560]   - Yeah, I won't say goop to it,
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:06.400]   but I know it's not right.
[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:07.240]   But anyway.
[00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:09.440]   - But, you know, so who is your competitor?
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:10.560]   And he said, well, we just,
[00:37:10.560 --> 00:37:12.680]   we didn't really design this with a competitor.
[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:15.560]   And mine sort of reminded me of Eric Schmidt's comment
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:16.400]   when someone asked--
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:17.400]   - Gondotra.
[00:37:17.400 --> 00:37:19.120]   - Gondotra, that's right.
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:21.440]   Eric Schmidt was asked, you compete with Microsoft,
[00:37:21.440 --> 00:37:23.800]   and he said, I don't know, I'm not Microsoft.
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:24.640]   (laughing)
[00:37:24.640 --> 00:37:26.160]   - That's their problem, not mine.
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:29.360]   But, but to your point, Leo, earlier,
[00:37:29.360 --> 00:37:32.920]   I mean, it kind of is like the web in the sense that
[00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:35.560]   what is this thing, it will be what we want it to be.
[00:37:35.560 --> 00:37:38.080]   Sort of like the internet will be--
[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:38.920]   - It's a mirror.
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:39.760]   - You want it to be.
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:40.600]   - Yeah.
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:42.360]   - Yeah, it's a reflection of everything,
[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:43.680]   you know, in the case of the web,
[00:37:43.680 --> 00:37:45.680]   everything that goes on from, you know,
[00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:50.680]   finding a cure to AIDS, to organizing acts of horrific evil.
[00:37:50.680 --> 00:37:52.320]   - Right.
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:37:55.480]   - But it, I don't, I'm not sure they do know what it is.
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:58.280]   I mean, it's a platform that's gonna evolve
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:01.800]   and it will be what, you know, what we create.
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:03.640]   - That's fine, as long as they understand that
[00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:05.160]   and they don't attempt to mold it,
[00:38:05.160 --> 00:38:07.000]   but I think that Google of all companies
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.120]   is most likely to let it be what it wants to be.
[00:38:10.120 --> 00:38:13.240]   Jake, you've developed for Facebook,
[00:38:13.240 --> 00:38:15.040]   and I'm sure that's a little, you know,
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:17.120]   feeling a little risky because at any point,
[00:38:17.120 --> 00:38:19.840]   Facebook could pull the plug on anything you do.
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:22.800]   - Uh-huh, I think it changed the profile layout or anything.
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:25.440]   - Yeah, and then, you know, it's a closed system.
[00:38:25.440 --> 00:38:27.720]   And yet, it's been a great system for developers.
[00:38:27.720 --> 00:38:30.480]   FBML is, you know, I guess fairly easy to write for
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:33.280]   and developers are making a lot of money,
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:35.800]   but you must look at something like Wave and say,
[00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:38.760]   that's kind of a more safe place to be.
[00:38:38.760 --> 00:38:39.600]   - Yeah, it's great.
[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:40.600]   - Yeah.
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:42.440]   Have you bought the book on GWT?
[00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:44.760]   - No, I want to though, 'cause I'm learning Java
[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:45.600]   and score right now.
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:46.400]   - It's perfect for that.
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:47.240]   - Yeah.
[00:38:47.240 --> 00:38:48.080]   - Yeah.
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:49.440]   Yeah, I think it's an interesting model,
[00:38:49.440 --> 00:38:51.280]   although you don't, by the way, I checked,
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:52.440]   you don't have to write in Java.
[00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:54.920]   There are bindings, there's also bi-things for Python.
[00:38:54.920 --> 00:38:55.760]   - Oh, cool.
[00:38:55.760 --> 00:38:56.600]   - Yeah.
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:38:57.440]   - Cool.
[00:38:57.440 --> 00:39:01.600]   - So, and I imagine, you know, it's not like Yahoo's user interface
[00:39:01.600 --> 00:39:05.480]   or jQuery, which are basically JavaScript libraries.
[00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:06.920]   You write in Java.
[00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:07.920]   - Right, yeah.
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:09.640]   - And I think that's kind of interesting.
[00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:10.800]   - It is, that's really cool.
[00:39:10.800 --> 00:39:11.800]   - Yeah.
[00:39:11.800 --> 00:39:14.360]   So, Jacob, you're gonna write some gadgets?
[00:39:14.360 --> 00:39:15.200]   - I hope so.
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:17.280]   I didn't still want to just share, like,
[00:39:17.280 --> 00:39:19.000]   how they got it working.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.040]   I think you have to make a bot or something.
[00:39:21.040 --> 00:39:22.600]   - Well, here's one thing that's kind of interesting.
[00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:24.680]   I asked Kevin Marks about this.
[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:26.240]   I said, "Is it like an iGoogle gadget?"
[00:39:26.240 --> 00:39:30.440]   He said, "Yeah, it's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript."
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:33.680]   Which, I mean, look it, if you're writing for WebOS,
[00:39:33.680 --> 00:39:38.000]   if you're writing for Google gadgets, Yahoo Dashboard,
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:41.360]   Yahoo widgets, Microsoft Dash, or Apple Dashboard,
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:45.280]   all of these are that CSS, HTML, and JavaScript.
[00:39:45.280 --> 00:39:47.800]   - That's great, because they take care of the synchronizing stuff.
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:49.920]   They said you just have to change the XHTML.
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:50.760]   - Is that cool?
[00:39:50.760 --> 00:39:53.240]   - And then it shows on all the other different sides.
[00:39:53.240 --> 00:39:57.160]   Did you watch the breakout presentation on this,
[00:39:57.160 --> 00:39:59.600]   what do they call object transformation?
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:00.440]   - No.
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:06.440]   - It's how you get this kind of asynchronous collaboration going on.
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:08.320]   It's very interesting, very sophisticated.
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:13.320]   It's kind of a modern computer science hot topic,
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:15.840]   flavor of the year.
[00:40:15.840 --> 00:40:17.840]   And they've done a good job, I think.
[00:40:17.840 --> 00:40:22.320]   This is gonna attract developers for some time.
[00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:26.160]   It does require HTML5, and that means Google
[00:40:26.160 --> 00:40:28.160]   called them modern browsers.
[00:40:28.160 --> 00:40:29.000]   - The euphemism.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:30.360]   - That's a good euphemism.
[00:40:30.360 --> 00:40:31.360]   (laughing)
[00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:32.720]   - The thon IE browsers.
[00:40:32.720 --> 00:40:34.200]   - Anything but IE.
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:35.040]   - Oxygen.
[00:40:35.040 --> 00:40:37.480]   - Well, no, it isn't, because in fact,
[00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:39.480]   what they call modern browsers are really not,
[00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:41.040]   in many cases, available yet.
[00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:47.240]   Chrome 2 will do a lot of it, Safari.
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:49.040]   But one thing they pointed out,
[00:40:49.040 --> 00:40:50.040]   or maybe it was Kevin pointed out,
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:53.360]   that really the best browsers for this are WebKit based.
[00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:55.520]   Chrome and Safari are WebKit based,
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:58.640]   but many mobile platforms are also WebKit based.
[00:40:58.640 --> 00:40:59.480]   Including--
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:00.320]   - There is the key, I think.
[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:03.280]   - I think that the power of this instantaneous communication
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:05.920]   on mobile is mind blowing, I think.
[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:08.960]   - Can you imagine, I mean, you have a wave, you get up,
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:10.000]   you've been reading this wave,
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:12.600]   you've been following the news, big story going on,
[00:41:12.600 --> 00:41:13.800]   you're following it on your desktop,
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:15.240]   you get up and it's on your phone,
[00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:18.200]   and you continue to follow, and continue to collaborate
[00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:19.680]   and contribute.
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:21.920]   - Do you think, one thing that I wanted it to do,
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:25.000]   and I don't know, I actually got kind of shouted down yesterday
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.200]   on the Gilmore Gang, because I said, well, I'd like--
[00:41:28.200 --> 00:41:29.040]   - That never happened.
[00:41:29.040 --> 00:41:29.880]   - Never happened.
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:34.040]   I'd like it to scale to a large group.
[00:41:34.040 --> 00:41:38.800]   I'm curious about it, and as a many-to-many communication tool,
[00:41:38.800 --> 00:41:40.000]   and I think it was Mark Cantor,
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:41.080]   so I'll forget it about it,
[00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:46.080]   it's gonna be, you know, few to few, 150 or fewer,
[00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:48.960]   it's not gonna be a media tool.
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:51.680]   Do you think, Jeff, it could be a media tool?
[00:41:51.680 --> 00:41:52.880]   - I think it could be.
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:55.960]   I think this idea of working collaboratively,
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:57.520]   assigning and questioning as you go,
[00:41:57.520 --> 00:41:59.120]   I'm working with Nokia at CUNY,
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:02.040]   where I teach with their devices
[00:42:02.040 --> 00:42:04.640]   to try to have an assignment structure they're working on.
[00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:06.600]   Well, you look at Wave, and right in the middle of it,
[00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:09.440]   you can say, who's there, what do you know,
[00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:12.920]   go get a picture, add the picture in, do this, do that.
[00:42:12.920 --> 00:42:16.320]   I guess to one extent in the Wave,
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:18.560]   if you wanna try to come out with a good product,
[00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:21.440]   maybe it's a benefit to be able to limit it,
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:25.000]   but I think that there have to be ways to structure it
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:27.680]   like Twitter, where you can follow people,
[00:42:27.680 --> 00:42:28.720]   and you can have-
[00:42:28.720 --> 00:42:29.560]   - That's, I agree.
[00:42:29.560 --> 00:42:32.000]   - The juicy part is different views of the same thing.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.240]   - Yes, and that's gonna be tough.
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:35.720]   I don't know how they do that, but that's,
[00:42:35.720 --> 00:42:37.120]   you're exactly right, this is the thing
[00:42:37.120 --> 00:42:41.600]   that makes Twitter work, is that you get to design your own
[00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:43.680]   in effect by choosing who you're following.
[00:42:43.680 --> 00:42:45.560]   I don't know how they're gonna do that.
[00:42:45.560 --> 00:42:48.400]   - Yeah, and I think that the idea that you and I
[00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:52.120]   might see the same Wave and see different versions of it.
[00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:54.800]   That's very confusing coming out of an era
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:57.640]   where every newspaper was printed exactly the same,
[00:42:57.640 --> 00:42:59.560]   we all saw the same thing.
[00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:01.480]   - Yeah, we all watched Ed Sullivan on Sunday night.
[00:43:01.480 --> 00:43:02.920]   - Customize web. - Yeah.
[00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:04.960]   - I mean, the whole adoption is gonna be super interesting,
[00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:07.920]   right, like I introduced friends to Gmail for the first time,
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:10.840]   and they get freaked out by the conversation threading,
[00:43:10.840 --> 00:43:12.560]   and the way that it works, it's different.
[00:43:12.560 --> 00:43:14.480]   It's different than, you know, the people that do so.
[00:43:14.480 --> 00:43:16.560]   - If that freaks them out, they're really in trouble.
[00:43:16.560 --> 00:43:17.560]   (laughing)
[00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:19.480]   - Yes, I mean, I think Wave adoption is gonna be like,
[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:21.760]   what is this at first?
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:24.440]   - But I think real time scares people initially.
[00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:26.200]   You know, I remember when "Friend Feed" went real time,
[00:43:26.200 --> 00:43:28.360]   there was all this noise, oh, it's too much, too fast,
[00:43:28.360 --> 00:43:29.360]   I can't keep up.
[00:43:29.360 --> 00:43:31.280]   And then people went, oh, wait a minute.
[00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:32.280]   Oh, this is compelling.
[00:43:32.280 --> 00:43:34.760]   Oh my God, and they got it.
[00:43:34.760 --> 00:43:36.040]   I think we're naturally live.
[00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:37.640]   All it is is human.
[00:43:37.640 --> 00:43:41.400]   This is real time, it's called a conversation.
[00:43:41.400 --> 00:43:42.720]   That's normal.
[00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:46.760]   - Part of the way you curate that is by the people you trust.
[00:43:46.760 --> 00:43:48.240]   - You're not gonna curate the kind of,
[00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:49.840]   I've always been saying for the last year
[00:43:49.840 --> 00:43:51.240]   that Google is behind on live
[00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:54.920]   because they need content to ferment like wine or cheese.
[00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:56.520]   They need to see the links come in.
[00:43:56.520 --> 00:43:58.400]   - It's hard to do real time search.
[00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:00.080]   - Well, exactly, and so I thought that's why they needed
[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:02.880]   to buy Twitter, and in a sense, they went around the left flank
[00:44:02.880 --> 00:44:07.080]   and around the issue to a whole new kind of live creation.
[00:44:07.080 --> 00:44:09.120]   - Wow, brilliant.
[00:44:09.120 --> 00:44:11.280]   - I had the same thing as you described with Twitter.
[00:44:11.280 --> 00:44:13.640]   When I first came on it, I was just over,
[00:44:13.640 --> 00:44:16.480]   until someone said you heard a tweet deck,
[00:44:16.480 --> 00:44:18.600]   and all of a sudden I could organize all this stuff
[00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:19.760]   in a way that I could deal with.
[00:44:19.760 --> 00:44:21.680]   - It got me on Tweety Dawn, it's much, much better.
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:25.480]   But I saw a question on Tweety on Twitter,
[00:44:25.480 --> 00:44:28.560]   asking someone, what is your Twitter handle, Don?
[00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:30.160]   - D-Tapscot.
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:31.000]   - I'll pass that on.
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:33.640]   - D-Tapscot, Gina Tripani.
[00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:36.920]   It's Jeff Jarvis, is it, or is it Buzz Machine?
[00:44:36.920 --> 00:44:39.640]   Jeff Jarvis, Jake Jarvis,
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:41.880]   and I don't give out my Twitter handle anymore.
[00:44:41.880 --> 00:44:42.720]   (laughing)
[00:44:42.720 --> 00:44:43.880]   - 'Cause you're just too famous.
[00:44:43.880 --> 00:44:45.600]   - You got too many followers.
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:47.720]   - You know, it used to be a lot of followers.
[00:44:47.720 --> 00:44:49.080]   There's nothing compared to P. Diddy.
[00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:51.040]   There was a little Twitter revulsion though,
[00:44:51.040 --> 00:44:53.200]   a revulsion, there's a Freudian slip,
[00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:55.780]   that little Twitter revolution,
[00:44:55.780 --> 00:44:57.240]   P. Diddy was started making a big deal
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:59.720]   about getting to a million followers,
[00:44:59.720 --> 00:45:02.200]   and all of a sudden there's a hot and rising topic,
[00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:05.960]   unfollow Diddy, and he dropped down very rapidly.
[00:45:05.960 --> 00:45:08.040]   Another 50,000 people dropped off, they said,
[00:45:08.040 --> 00:45:08.880]   "I don't know."
[00:45:08.880 --> 00:45:10.920]   Is this the Twitter that we want?
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:14.920]   Same thing with this, you're not playing this spy,
[00:45:14.920 --> 00:45:16.880]   what is this game, Spy Master?
[00:45:16.880 --> 00:45:18.080]   - No, I signed up for it.
[00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:19.400]   - You did?
[00:45:19.400 --> 00:45:20.240]   - Yeah.
[00:45:20.240 --> 00:45:21.960]   - I'm curious.
[00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:22.560]   - You're not gonna be one of those
[00:45:22.560 --> 00:45:24.400]   Spy Master spammers.
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:26.680]   I think Twitter,
[00:45:26.680 --> 00:45:29.400]   Twitter's problems right now is that it's very easy to game it,
[00:45:29.400 --> 00:45:31.880]   and to get game trending topics,
[00:45:31.880 --> 00:45:35.160]   and by putting trending topics right on the front page there,
[00:45:35.160 --> 00:45:38.200]   they have encouraged people to start gaming it
[00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:39.480]   with things like Spy Master,
[00:45:39.480 --> 00:45:41.960]   and that's gonna increase the signal noise,
[00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:44.640]   but the beauty of it is that you get to follow
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:45.880]   your interest in.
[00:45:45.880 --> 00:45:48.960]   I haven't seen only one of my friends, Wanna,
[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:50.160]   I'm thinking to you,
[00:45:50.160 --> 00:45:54.320]   only one of my friends now has had a Spy Master post on Twitter
[00:45:54.320 --> 00:45:56.320]   whereas a lot of people are complaining about this,
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:45:58.320]   and it's because who I follow,
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:46:00.440]   the quality people like Eugene that I follow
[00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:02.320]   aren't playing those stupid games.
[00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:06.040]   So that's the beauty of this follow model,
[00:46:06.040 --> 00:46:07.400]   I don't know if we can apply it to Wave,
[00:46:07.400 --> 00:46:09.280]   I'd love to see that though.
[00:46:09.280 --> 00:46:11.400]   - Well, ultimately it's, you know,
[00:46:11.400 --> 00:46:13.160]   age of transparency, I mean,
[00:46:13.160 --> 00:46:15.160]   real value comes to the fore.
[00:46:15.160 --> 00:46:16.200]   If you're gonna be-- - I love that,
[00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:17.040]   I hope that's true.
[00:46:17.040 --> 00:46:18.160]   - If you're gonna be on Twitter
[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:19.240]   and you're gonna be a jerk
[00:46:19.240 --> 00:46:21.680]   or just promoting your own thing or whatever,
[00:46:21.680 --> 00:46:23.320]   you're gonna lose it, so.
[00:46:23.320 --> 00:46:26.960]   - As long as we have the tools to do that,
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:30.560]   then I do have high hopes that quality will arise.
[00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:33.520]   - I just saw on the IRC, no surprise,
[00:46:33.520 --> 00:46:35.280]   Scoble was on Spy Master.
[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:37.520]   (laughing)
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:39.000]   - Of course. - Well he has the good sense
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:40.480]   not to tweet at them because I--
[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:42.440]   (laughing)
[00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:44.040]   - Then Jake, you don't tweet it,
[00:46:44.040 --> 00:46:45.720]   you can play it, just don't tweet it, okay?
[00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:47.440]   - No, I haven't. (laughing)
[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:50.320]   Jake, did you ever do World of Warcraft?
[00:46:50.320 --> 00:46:52.440]   - For a few months when it came out,
[00:46:52.440 --> 00:46:54.440]   it's not as effective as people say, I don't think.
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:56.720]   - I, you know, I played World of Warcraft,
[00:46:56.720 --> 00:46:58.720]   I probably sunk 40 hours into it.
[00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:00.520]   In order to get to really a high level,
[00:47:00.520 --> 00:47:03.040]   you gotta be, you gotta spend a lot of time on it.
[00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:03.960]   And it's not that much fun,
[00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:05.920]   it's a lot of running around.
[00:47:05.920 --> 00:47:07.840]   I wanna kill things, I don't wanna run around.
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:09.680]   (laughing)
[00:47:09.680 --> 00:47:10.920]   You don't play WoW, do you, Jean?
[00:47:10.920 --> 00:47:12.080]   And none of the people here play WoW,
[00:47:12.080 --> 00:47:13.560]   they're too productive.
[00:47:13.560 --> 00:47:16.120]   - No, no, no, no, no, I would lose my entire life
[00:47:16.120 --> 00:47:18.520]   immediately, I think, running around.
[00:47:18.520 --> 00:47:20.080]   I'm sure that I would drown immediately
[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:21.320]   or do something stupid or like,
[00:47:21.320 --> 00:47:23.160]   wind up in the woods and kill, I don't know.
[00:47:23.160 --> 00:47:24.480]   (laughing)
[00:47:24.480 --> 00:47:25.400]   I'm not bad at the games.
[00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:27.040]   - I had a really funny one happen to me,
[00:47:27.040 --> 00:47:31.240]   I was over at Noki and Helsinki and it came up,
[00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:34.280]   WoW came up and one of the senior execs
[00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:36.040]   came up to me afterwards and he says,
[00:47:36.040 --> 00:47:37.600]   I think I have a good story for you,
[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:40.480]   he says my 15 year old is a guild master
[00:47:40.480 --> 00:47:43.960]   and it was New Year's Day and he's allowed to play
[00:47:43.960 --> 00:47:47.280]   on holidays and he wasn't playing and they said,
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:48.920]   hey, how come you're not playing today?
[00:47:48.920 --> 00:47:50.280]   He says, dad, it's New Year's Day,
[00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:52.240]   it's not a good day to go on a raid.
[00:47:52.240 --> 00:47:54.080]   Everyone in my guild is hung over.
[00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:54.920]   - Oh!
[00:47:54.920 --> 00:47:57.080]   - And the dad is mortified, like,
[00:47:57.080 --> 00:47:57.920]   what are you talking about?
[00:47:57.920 --> 00:47:59.040]   Why are all these kids drinking
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:00.440]   and then the kid had to explain to him,
[00:48:00.440 --> 00:48:02.480]   on the average age it's probably 30 times.
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:04.560]   - It's a count, there's a bunch of accountants.
[00:48:04.560 --> 00:48:06.960]   He's really, he was playing World of Warcraft.
[00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:08.800]   We're gonna take a break,
[00:48:08.800 --> 00:48:11.080]   we have so much to talk about,
[00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:13.280]   but I'd like to, we've got a great panel here,
[00:48:13.280 --> 00:48:16.240]   Don Tapscott, Gina Trapani,
[00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:18.040]   Jeff Jarvis and Jake Jarvis,
[00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:20.280]   and we're getting some great feedback,
[00:48:20.280 --> 00:48:22.280]   by the way, real time feedback in our chat room.
[00:48:22.280 --> 00:48:23.880]   We have five chat rooms going at once
[00:48:23.880 --> 00:48:26.360]   plus our Twitch conversations.
[00:48:26.360 --> 00:48:29.200]   It's just really, I like the interactivity of it.
[00:48:29.200 --> 00:48:31.240]   I like the party feel of what we're doing.
[00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:32.880]   We're gonna talk some more in just a bit.
[00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:36.280]   But I wanna mention our friends at audible.com.
[00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:38.840]   Any, I'm just gonna ask out here, any of you,
[00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:41.440]   any of you listen to audio, audio books,
[00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:43.960]   you travel a ton, Don, you've got to.
[00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:46.760]   - I don't a lot, I have to tell you the truth.
[00:48:46.760 --> 00:48:48.040]   - I'm surprised.
[00:48:48.040 --> 00:48:50.360]   - Yeah, I should more, I just, yeah.
[00:48:50.360 --> 00:48:51.560]   - It's a great way not to waste time.
[00:48:51.560 --> 00:48:53.440]   You're an audible listener, Jeff.
[00:48:53.440 --> 00:48:55.320]   - Yeah, I am, and I'm proud to be on audible.
[00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:57.120]   I recorded my own audio book.
[00:48:57.120 --> 00:48:57.960]   - Did you?
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:48:59.280]   - You could hear how fast I talk,
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:49:01.400]   nine and three quarters hours of me,
[00:49:01.400 --> 00:49:04.120]   I couldn't even bear, but people are nice, they buy it.
[00:49:04.120 --> 00:49:05.600]   - So it's unabridged.
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:06.440]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:08.760]   It's every damn comma.
[00:49:08.760 --> 00:49:09.600]   (laughing)
[00:49:09.600 --> 00:49:12.880]   - It's such an intimidating idea of actually reading
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:15.000]   your entire book and recording it.
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:18.120]   I've never, I've had publishers ask me to do that,
[00:49:18.120 --> 00:49:18.960]   and I've always been an actor.
[00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:20.480]   - Don, I've listened to your book.
[00:49:20.480 --> 00:49:22.200]   And it's weird because I hear you,
[00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:25.320]   and that's not how my mind's ear heard you before.
[00:49:25.320 --> 00:49:26.760]   - Right, yeah.
[00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:30.360]   Don's economics, how mass collaboration changes everything,
[00:49:30.360 --> 00:49:33.640]   which was really the prescient book in all of this.
[00:49:33.640 --> 00:49:35.400]   I mean, when did that come out?
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:38.080]   - The end of 2006.
[00:49:38.080 --> 00:49:40.240]   - It was according to Amazon sales,
[00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:43.760]   it was the number one management book for the year in 2007.
[00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:44.600]   But.
[00:49:44.600 --> 00:49:47.200]   - But it came out in 2006.
[00:49:47.200 --> 00:49:48.720]   That's available in Audible.
[00:49:48.720 --> 00:49:51.000]   And of course, what would Google do
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:52.760]   is available in Audible?
[00:49:52.760 --> 00:49:53.600]   Now here's the good news,
[00:49:53.600 --> 00:49:56.720]   I'm gonna give you a chance to get two books free.
[00:49:56.720 --> 00:49:59.120]   So there you go, there are your two books,
[00:49:59.120 --> 00:50:01.680]   go to audible.com/twit2,
[00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:04.160]   if you sign up for the platinum account,
[00:50:04.160 --> 00:50:05.320]   you can get, now Gina,
[00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:07.000]   when you put the life hacker book on Audible,
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.440]   then we're gonna have to come up with a new offer.
[00:50:09.440 --> 00:50:10.960]   - If I could stand this out on my own voice
[00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:12.600]   for that many hours, yeah.
[00:50:12.600 --> 00:50:14.800]   - You don't have to read your own book.
[00:50:14.800 --> 00:50:15.640]   - That's good news.
[00:50:15.640 --> 00:50:17.200]   - And actually, Audible's been asking me,
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:18.280]   what are you gonna read, what are you gonna read?
[00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:19.120]   They want me to read a book.
[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:21.200]   And so that's just gonna be a tough one to choose.
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:22.880]   I think I'm gonna read fiction.
[00:50:22.880 --> 00:50:23.880]   I like fiction.
[00:50:23.880 --> 00:50:25.960]   - I think you should do Don's next book.
[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:27.280]   - I'd like to hear your question.
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:28.600]   - That's the opposite of fiction.
[00:50:28.600 --> 00:50:29.920]   (laughing)
[00:50:29.920 --> 00:50:32.200]   - That gets common of the day, Jeff.
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:34.640]   (laughing)
[00:50:34.640 --> 00:50:36.280]   Audible.com/twit2,
[00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:37.440]   sign up for the platinum account.
[00:50:37.440 --> 00:50:39.800]   50, no, I'm sorry, 60,000 books now,
[00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:41.760]   a huge variety, business,
[00:50:41.760 --> 00:50:45.040]   but also fiction, great performances,
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:46.120]   young adults as well,
[00:50:46.120 --> 00:50:49.240]   mysteries, thrillers, a fantastic sci-fi section.
[00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:50.120]   It is my bookstore,
[00:50:50.120 --> 00:50:51.280]   and I think it'll become yours too.
[00:50:51.280 --> 00:50:54.440]   There's a new one, by the way, called Twitter Power IC.
[00:50:54.440 --> 00:50:57.560]   Wow, this is the first Twitter book to make it on Audible.com.
[00:50:57.560 --> 00:50:59.560]   I wonder if it's all in 140 characters, right?
[00:50:59.560 --> 00:51:02.520]   - He says the book's 140 characters in law.
[00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:04.440]   - I could listen to that.
[00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:05.960]   Audible.com/twit2,
[00:51:05.960 --> 00:51:10.720]   we thank him so much for their support of this week in tech.
[00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:14.400]   We were talking about,
[00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:17.080]   before the show began, about education,
[00:51:17.080 --> 00:51:18.240]   and that's one of the things Don,
[00:51:18.240 --> 00:51:20.880]   you're very active in,
[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:23.840]   is in how the pedagogy is changing.
[00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:27.760]   - Yeah, basically, if somebody was frozen 100 years ago
[00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:30.000]   and they miraculously came alive today
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.240]   and they looked around at the professions,
[00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:34.040]   a doctor in an operating theater,
[00:51:34.040 --> 00:51:35.840]   a pilot and a jitter,
[00:51:35.840 --> 00:51:37.540]   they think, "Wow, it's a world ever changed
[00:51:37.540 --> 00:51:39.680]   "and technology has been at the heart of..."
[00:51:39.680 --> 00:51:41.480]   If they walked into a lecture theater
[00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:44.040]   at a typical university or in a classroom,
[00:51:44.040 --> 00:51:45.520]   they'd breathe a sigh of relief.
[00:51:45.520 --> 00:51:46.880]   They'd say, "This is something I've read."
[00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:49.720]   - The university is exactly the same.
[00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:51.200]   - You know, the model,
[00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:53.080]   you could call it broadcast learning.
[00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:54.400]   I'm a teacher, I have knowledge.
[00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:56.000]   You're a student, you're an empty vessel,
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:57.720]   you don't get ready, here it comes.
[00:51:57.720 --> 00:52:01.000]   You know, and your goal is to take it into
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.400]   short-term, active memory and through practice
[00:52:03.400 --> 00:52:05.920]   and repetition to build deeper structures
[00:52:05.920 --> 00:52:08.080]   so that you can recall it to me when I test you,
[00:52:08.080 --> 00:52:09.640]   drill and kill.
[00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:13.720]   And the problem, the problem is not just
[00:52:13.720 --> 00:52:15.520]   that that's a bad way of learning.
[00:52:15.520 --> 00:52:17.880]   The problem is Jake.
[00:52:17.880 --> 00:52:20.760]   Like Jake's grown up interacting with content.
[00:52:20.760 --> 00:52:23.120]   My generation grew up watching TV,
[00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:26.640]   24 hours a week, so that broadcast model was okay.
[00:52:26.640 --> 00:52:29.200]   But today, kids don't learn that way.
[00:52:29.200 --> 00:52:31.640]   And the whole model of pedagogy is wrong
[00:52:31.640 --> 00:52:35.200]   for the generation that's gonna dominate this century.
[00:52:35.200 --> 00:52:36.880]   So we have a big disconnect,
[00:52:36.880 --> 00:52:38.720]   I think that shaping up in the universities.
[00:52:38.720 --> 00:52:40.600]   And there's been a lot of hand-ringing
[00:52:40.600 --> 00:52:43.400]   about the university, big article in the New York Times
[00:52:43.400 --> 00:52:45.240]   called the demise of the university
[00:52:45.240 --> 00:52:47.040]   that caused a lot of flack.
[00:52:47.040 --> 00:52:50.160]   But all the criticisms of the university,
[00:52:50.160 --> 00:52:51.560]   to me, come down to this one,
[00:52:51.560 --> 00:52:54.440]   that when you've got the smartest kids
[00:52:54.440 --> 00:52:56.400]   thinking the thing to do is to get an A,
[00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:58.360]   without having ever gone to a lecture.
[00:52:58.360 --> 00:53:00.040]   The writing's on the wall.
[00:53:00.040 --> 00:53:02.840]   You know, we need to move to a model of learning
[00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:05.520]   that's student-focused and that's collaborative,
[00:53:05.520 --> 00:53:07.400]   and that's not one size fits all.
[00:53:07.400 --> 00:53:08.600]   Universities are really designed
[00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:11.840]   around creating more university professors, essentially.
[00:53:11.840 --> 00:53:14.000]   Well, that's been a big part of it,
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:16.320]   and even on that, it doesn't do well.
[00:53:16.320 --> 00:53:18.040]   Like, you have all these graduate students
[00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:20.360]   wanting to be professors and they're not jobs.
[00:53:20.360 --> 00:53:21.800]   There's no jobs.
[00:53:21.800 --> 00:53:22.640]   Jake.
[00:53:22.640 --> 00:53:23.480]   Not I think you're absolutely right.
[00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:26.280]   And I don't mean to interrupt my own son there,
[00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:29.360]   but, you know, Jake's been, this year as a junior,
[00:53:29.360 --> 00:53:30.920]   taught to the test.
[00:53:30.920 --> 00:53:31.760]   Right.
[00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:33.840]   Testing is an industrial age model
[00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:35.640]   of stamping out the students all the same,
[00:53:35.640 --> 00:53:37.160]   trying to say the same right answers.
[00:53:37.160 --> 00:53:39.160]   And those are not the people who are gonna invent
[00:53:39.160 --> 00:53:40.000]   the next Google.
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:42.280]   Even teachers hate that, frankly.
[00:53:42.280 --> 00:53:44.360]   Unfortunately, that's government mandated these days,
[00:53:44.360 --> 00:53:45.440]   and it's really a shame.
[00:53:45.440 --> 00:53:48.880]   Jake, what, do you supplement your education?
[00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:50.560]   How do you handle this?
[00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:52.840]   I just do it in school.
[00:53:52.840 --> 00:53:53.680]   I mean--
[00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:54.520]   You're told.
[00:53:54.520 --> 00:53:55.360]   (laughs)
[00:53:55.360 --> 00:53:56.920]   My son doesn't do what he's told,
[00:53:56.920 --> 00:53:59.800]   and I have trouble with that, because on the one hand,
[00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:02.480]   I feel like he needs to get an education and get A's,
[00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:05.320]   and, but on the other hand, I think that maybe his creativity
[00:54:05.320 --> 00:54:06.280]   is being stifled.
[00:54:06.280 --> 00:54:08.360]   Maybe he shouldn't do what he's told.
[00:54:08.360 --> 00:54:09.200]   Yeah.
[00:54:09.200 --> 00:54:10.640]   So, Jake, why do you do that?
[00:54:10.640 --> 00:54:15.680]   Well, I mean, like an AP class is about getting a five
[00:54:15.680 --> 00:54:16.520]   on the test, so--
[00:54:16.520 --> 00:54:17.360]   Got the test.
[00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:18.840]   If you get a five on the test, then I just--
[00:54:18.840 --> 00:54:19.760]   You wanna go to college.
[00:54:19.760 --> 00:54:21.600]   Yeah, and if you don't do that,
[00:54:21.600 --> 00:54:23.880]   you're not gonna get into a good school.
[00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:24.720]   Right.
[00:54:24.720 --> 00:54:26.440]   I agree with that way, but that's how it is.
[00:54:26.440 --> 00:54:28.800]   Yeah, my daughter is also a junior in high school
[00:54:28.800 --> 00:54:31.320]   and totally focused on getting into college,
[00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:32.720]   because we've brainwashed her,
[00:54:32.720 --> 00:54:35.280]   the culture's brainwashed her, that that's what you do.
[00:54:35.280 --> 00:54:37.360]   You know, this gets to a really fundamental thing,
[00:54:37.360 --> 00:54:40.160]   which is the purpose of education.
[00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:45.160]   I mean, when I graduated, you went to university,
[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:47.680]   you chose a field, and you graduated,
[00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:48.760]   and you were set for life.
[00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:51.240]   You just kept up in your chosen field.
[00:54:51.240 --> 00:54:53.920]   Today, you're not set for life.
[00:54:53.920 --> 00:54:55.800]   You're set for like, I don't know, 15 minutes.
[00:54:55.800 --> 00:54:56.640]   They're not set at all.
[00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:58.480]   You may not be set at all in half.
[00:54:58.480 --> 00:55:00.640]   You know, what you took in the first year,
[00:55:00.640 --> 00:55:02.360]   if it was a technical course, is obviously,
[00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:04.120]   by the time you get to the fourth year.
[00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:07.640]   So it's not your ability to perform on tests,
[00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:11.680]   or even to a certain extent, what you know that counts
[00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:15.080]   when you graduate at your capacity to learn lifelong
[00:55:15.080 --> 00:55:18.400]   and to think and to communicate and solve problems
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:22.080]   and be critical, and to search, you know,
[00:55:22.080 --> 00:55:24.360]   to research and to authenticate
[00:55:24.360 --> 00:55:27.440]   and to have good BS detectors and so on.
[00:55:27.440 --> 00:55:31.760]   And I think we're just totally headed in the wrong direction.
[00:55:31.760 --> 00:55:35.640]   These institutions, if we don't invent them for relevance,
[00:55:35.640 --> 00:55:38.400]   then they will fall.
[00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:42.360]   There's all kinds of signs that the universities
[00:55:42.360 --> 00:55:44.000]   are in deep trouble.
[00:55:44.000 --> 00:55:47.040]   - Gina, what did you study in college?
[00:55:47.040 --> 00:55:48.920]   - Well, I was in English major in college.
[00:55:48.920 --> 00:55:49.760]   - See, there you go.
[00:55:49.760 --> 00:55:51.960]   - In comps I, well, I was a computer science
[00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:53.640]   minor and then why am I getting my graduate degree
[00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:56.480]   at CUNY in New York in computer science?
[00:55:56.480 --> 00:55:57.320]   - Yeah, CUNY.
[00:55:57.320 --> 00:55:58.400]   - Yeah, CUNY, yeah.
[00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:00.200]   I went to Brooklyn College, JQD.
[00:56:00.200 --> 00:56:01.360]   - KU-D, English too.
[00:56:01.360 --> 00:56:05.160]   - You know what, I spent a lot of time at UC San Diego.
[00:56:05.160 --> 00:56:06.880]   And actually, it was interesting earlier
[00:56:06.880 --> 00:56:08.080]   when we were talking about Facebook,
[00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:10.400]   my spouse is an administrator at the university.
[00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:14.480]   So she runs into photos of students doing things
[00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:15.760]   that they shouldn't be doing all the time.
[00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:18.240]   She sort of legally bound to do something about it.
[00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:20.360]   She doesn't friend anyone that doesn't friend her.
[00:56:20.360 --> 00:56:22.880]   So that's kind of going back to her.
[00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:23.720]   - That's interesting.
[00:56:23.720 --> 00:56:25.200]   She doesn't want to see.
[00:56:25.200 --> 00:56:26.040]   - Yeah, no, no.
[00:56:26.040 --> 00:56:27.200]   No, she doesn't want to see.
[00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:29.360]   Unless it's pushed to her.
[00:56:29.360 --> 00:56:32.560]   She's not like on Facebook, checking in on her students.
[00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:34.280]   She's literally like, do what you want to do,
[00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:35.760]   make your decisions, I'm going to educate you,
[00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:36.640]   but I don't want to see.
[00:56:36.640 --> 00:56:38.000]   - See, you know, we both.
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:40.360]   - Exactly, but she comes up on a picture
[00:56:40.360 --> 00:56:43.000]   of a student holding like a enormous bag of weed
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:44.360]   in a dorm room. - She has to do something right.
[00:56:44.360 --> 00:56:46.360]   - Legally, she has to do something about it.
[00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:49.560]   So that's kind of an interesting thread.
[00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:51.520]   But also at UC San Diego, I mean,
[00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:53.920]   I kind of agree what you were just saying about universities,
[00:56:53.920 --> 00:56:55.800]   but isn't there some, aren't there some systems
[00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:57.000]   of participation happening?
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.960]   I mean, I heard that in large lecture halls here at least,
[00:56:59.960 --> 00:57:01.840]   there's like a remote control that you can buy.
[00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:03.440]   And then, you know,
[00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:04.960]   - Turns off the lecture.
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:06.840]   - Well, professors ask questions
[00:57:06.840 --> 00:57:08.440]   and then students, you know, through like,
[00:57:08.440 --> 00:57:10.800]   I guess it's some sort of like IR remote, you know,
[00:57:10.800 --> 00:57:12.840]   answer, choose the answer that they think.
[00:57:12.840 --> 00:57:15.120]   And then it gets aggregated on the screen online, you know,
[00:57:15.120 --> 00:57:15.960]   live, which is, you know.
[00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:17.760]   - Why don't I just put Twitter up on the screen, Bob?
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:18.840]   - Yeah, seriously.
[00:57:18.840 --> 00:57:20.000]   - Yeah, I know.
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:22.160]   - That's a little scary probably for most professors.
[00:57:22.160 --> 00:57:24.200]   - I think we need Bar Camp U.
[00:57:24.200 --> 00:57:25.120]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:57:25.120 --> 00:57:28.480]   Bar Camp University, how to teach teaching?
[00:57:28.480 --> 00:57:29.640]   - Exactly, exactly.
[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:30.480]   So, I mean, I don't know
[00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:31.560]   that that's gonna solve all the problems.
[00:57:31.560 --> 00:57:33.680]   I mean, it's just like, you know, real time polling.
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:35.760]   I mean, I would say it's a multiple choice answer
[00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:38.400]   from what I understand, but it's moving toward that
[00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:39.240]   a little bit.
[00:57:39.240 --> 00:57:40.280]   - Yeah, I think it's a step.
[00:57:40.280 --> 00:57:43.440]   It's still, it's sort of fiddling with the old,
[00:57:43.440 --> 00:57:45.320]   you know, one way model.
[00:57:45.320 --> 00:57:48.000]   - Are you saying disband the whole thing?
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:51.680]   - Well, look at 19, what was it, 76?
[00:57:51.680 --> 00:57:55.040]   I took a graduate course in statistics.
[00:57:55.040 --> 00:57:57.800]   At the University of Alberta, it was all on a computer.
[00:57:57.800 --> 00:58:02.080]   PDP 1170 with a BT100 terminal
[00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:05.720]   and a slide projector connected to the, wow.
[00:58:05.720 --> 00:58:09.400]   The prof was right there, so no decline
[00:58:09.400 --> 00:58:11.040]   in face-to-face communication,
[00:58:11.040 --> 00:58:14.600]   but he was out of the transmission of data business.
[00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:17.960]   And, well, in statistics, there's no one size fits all.
[00:58:17.960 --> 00:58:20.600]   Anyway, I mean, everyone in the classroom is either bored
[00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:22.080]   or they don't get it.
[00:58:22.080 --> 00:58:25.640]   So I went through things at my own pace,
[00:58:25.640 --> 00:58:27.240]   things I understood, I went through quickly,
[00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:29.320]   things I didn't understand and went over and over again.
[00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:30.320]   I got an A.
[00:58:30.320 --> 00:58:32.720]   Most kids did.
[00:58:32.720 --> 00:58:35.520]   - You're saying computer teaching is a future?
[00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:38.440]   - It's not about the technology.
[00:58:38.440 --> 00:58:40.680]   It's changing the relationship between the student
[00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:41.520]   and the teacher.
[00:58:41.520 --> 00:58:43.640]   - Letting you pull the information, yeah.
[00:58:43.640 --> 00:58:46.000]   - And there's a big role for face-to-face,
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:47.480]   small group discussions, really--
[00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:49.000]   - Not for lectures.
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:51.160]   - No, like the lectures, the process,
[00:58:51.160 --> 00:58:54.360]   whereby the notes of a lecture go to the notes of a student
[00:58:54.360 --> 00:58:57.280]   without going through the brains of either of the face.
[00:58:57.280 --> 00:58:58.840]   Now, as someone who gives a lot of lectures,
[00:58:58.840 --> 00:59:01.920]   I appreciate the irony of that particular point of view.
[00:59:01.920 --> 00:59:03.520]   - Well, let's do something for Jake
[00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:04.960]   and for my daughter and for all the kids.
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:09.640]   I mean, we have a lot of smart kids listen to this show
[00:59:09.640 --> 00:59:11.720]   and they're in the same mind, Jake's in,
[00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:12.920]   they gotta get the grades.
[00:59:12.920 --> 00:59:16.040]   I mean, I don't want to undermine you, Dad, but--
[00:59:16.040 --> 00:59:18.120]   - Abolish the SAT, start there.
[00:59:18.120 --> 00:59:19.440]   - There you go.
[00:59:19.440 --> 00:59:22.400]   - Abolish, get rid of the educational testing service
[00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:25.520]   and abolish the notion of teaching to tests
[00:59:25.520 --> 00:59:26.880]   and teach to creativity.
[00:59:26.880 --> 00:59:29.640]   Why don't universities and high schools
[00:59:29.640 --> 00:59:31.800]   have Google's 20% rule?
[00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:32.640]   Start there.
[00:59:32.640 --> 00:59:33.520]   - There, that's a great idea.
[00:59:33.520 --> 00:59:37.680]   Google encourages, in fact, I think commands its employees
[00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:40.360]   to spend 20% of their time one day and five
[00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:41.880]   doing stuff that they're interested in.
[00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:45.040]   And some of the best stuff out of Google's been 20% stuff.
[00:59:45.040 --> 00:59:46.720]   What's gonna get us out of this mess
[00:59:46.720 --> 00:59:51.640]   is not industrial age people marching like in the 1984 commercial.
[00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:53.800]   It's gonna be people who are creating new things
[00:59:53.800 --> 00:59:55.400]   and are empowered to do so.
[00:59:55.400 --> 00:59:59.480]   As a dad in all candor, I feel guilty that like you,
[00:59:59.480 --> 01:00:01.320]   I say, yeah, Jake, you're right, that's what you have to do
[01:00:01.320 --> 01:00:03.040]   to get into Carnegie Mellon,
[01:00:03.040 --> 01:00:05.000]   where he's going this summer, I'm proud to say.
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.600]   But on the other hand, how much more could he learn
[01:00:07.600 --> 01:00:10.720]   if he were creating things, programs, companies,
[01:00:10.720 --> 01:00:11.960]   all kinds of other things?
[01:00:11.960 --> 01:00:13.480]   How do we mix the two in?
[01:00:13.480 --> 01:00:15.120]   Because right now they just don't work together.
[01:00:15.120 --> 01:00:19.600]   - I felt like that the convergence of digital tools
[01:00:19.600 --> 01:00:23.680]   and the internet, both lowering the cost of creation
[01:00:23.680 --> 01:00:25.680]   and giving you a distribution medium,
[01:00:25.680 --> 01:00:28.760]   is going to foster an explosion of creativity
[01:00:28.760 --> 01:00:31.840]   unlike anything we've seen since the Cambrian explosion.
[01:00:31.840 --> 01:00:33.440]   I really think that we are on the verge
[01:00:33.440 --> 01:00:36.080]   of an amazing explosion of creativity.
[01:00:36.080 --> 01:00:40.280]   And I don't, I think people like Jake are a good example
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:42.720]   of somebody who is both doing in the background,
[01:00:42.720 --> 01:00:44.680]   doing this creativity and then forced to kind of
[01:00:44.680 --> 01:00:48.000]   go down this channel that is really increasingly irrelevant.
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:50.360]   But you can't get rid of these institutions overnight,
[01:00:50.360 --> 01:00:52.160]   I wish we could.
[01:00:52.160 --> 01:00:55.920]   But look at all that Jake can accomplish on the side.
[01:00:55.920 --> 01:00:58.640]   - That's true. - Imagine if the world
[01:00:58.640 --> 01:01:02.160]   was organized to let him accomplish full time.
[01:01:02.160 --> 01:01:03.280]   So it would be unbelievable.
[01:01:03.280 --> 01:01:04.160]   - Yeah.
[01:01:04.160 --> 01:01:08.320]   - So why don't we start his parents?
[01:01:08.320 --> 01:01:11.640]   Jeff, why don't we just say, all right, don't go to college.
[01:01:11.640 --> 01:01:14.520]   Because his wife, my wife and his mother
[01:01:14.520 --> 01:01:16.480]   in the other room would come in and kill me.
[01:01:16.480 --> 01:01:18.400]   - And my wife will kill me.
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:21.080]   She's on the college tour with my daughter right now.
[01:01:21.080 --> 01:01:21.920]   - I know.
[01:01:21.920 --> 01:01:22.760]   - Let's throw it at her.
[01:01:22.760 --> 01:01:27.000]   - Fred Roulson, Jake met David, I'm sorry, Jake, a carp.
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:28.640]   - Oh, David carp, the creator of Tumblr.
[01:01:28.640 --> 01:01:29.480]   - Tumblr? - Yeah.
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:31.640]   - And Fred, 'cause Fred said that Jake
[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:33.640]   should have a mentor like that or someone to meet
[01:01:33.640 --> 01:01:34.480]   to see his father. - Perfect.
[01:01:34.480 --> 01:01:35.480]   - David's like 24.
[01:01:35.480 --> 01:01:38.320]   - Well, Fred warned me that David quit high school
[01:01:38.320 --> 01:01:39.560]   to start the company. - Yeah.
[01:01:39.560 --> 01:01:42.880]   - And when we came home, his mother, my wife said,
[01:01:42.880 --> 01:01:44.600]   don't you think of it?
[01:01:44.600 --> 01:01:45.840]   (laughing)
[01:01:45.840 --> 01:01:49.200]   - But that comes from a fear that is understandable,
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:51.440]   that if you don't go to college, get the four year degree,
[01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:53.200]   get the diploma, get the graduate degree,
[01:01:53.200 --> 01:01:54.280]   you won't be able to get a job.
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:58.440]   And I think we know now that that's a fallacious fear.
[01:01:58.440 --> 01:02:00.120]   In fact, it's the wrong direction.
[01:02:00.120 --> 01:02:03.320]   - Universities should be incubators of creation.
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:05.880]   And they are the opposite now.
[01:02:05.880 --> 01:02:07.800]   I teach a course in entrepreneurial journalism.
[01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:09.040]   I teach an university.
[01:02:09.040 --> 01:02:10.760]   I do it because I wanna be around the young people
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:12.520]   who are gonna reinvent journalism.
[01:02:12.520 --> 01:02:16.200]   And I try to foster that, but they care about the grades.
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:18.080]   And I say, don't give a damn about the grade.
[01:02:18.080 --> 01:02:20.040]   You might get money at the end of this course
[01:02:20.040 --> 01:02:20.920]   to start a company.
[01:02:20.920 --> 01:02:22.360]   That's better than a grade.
[01:02:22.360 --> 01:02:23.960]   - Texan says in our chatroom something
[01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:25.320]   that is a reasonable thing,
[01:02:25.320 --> 01:02:27.880]   I want my doctor to go to college.
[01:02:27.880 --> 01:02:30.360]   I want my lawyer to go to college.
[01:02:30.360 --> 01:02:31.720]   But there's been a lot of thought
[01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:34.800]   that maybe instead of a four year liberal arts degree
[01:02:34.800 --> 01:02:37.160]   leading into a graduate degree that lets you be a lawyer
[01:02:37.160 --> 01:02:39.120]   or a doctor, that we get right down to it.
[01:02:39.120 --> 01:02:41.280]   And we pursue the profession that we intend to pursue.
[01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:45.720]   And treat these trades as trades.
[01:02:45.720 --> 01:02:47.320]   - But here's the thing, the credential.
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:50.200]   This is an important function of the university's credentials.
[01:02:50.200 --> 01:02:52.880]   Okay, that you've gone through the motions.
[01:02:52.880 --> 01:02:55.360]   You've showed that you can buckle down
[01:02:55.360 --> 01:03:00.360]   and you've acquired a certain base of knowledge.
[01:03:00.360 --> 01:03:05.560]   But that's only sustainable if it is shown over time
[01:03:05.560 --> 01:03:08.240]   that this is the best way to get that knowledge.
[01:03:08.240 --> 01:03:12.480]   So there was a panel that I watched.
[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:14.720]   It was probably about three years ago
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:16.320]   where there were a bunch of doctors,
[01:03:16.320 --> 01:03:19.760]   or heads of big hospitals complaining
[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:22.440]   about the cost of the healthcare system.
[01:03:22.440 --> 01:03:25.040]   And the head of Johns Hopkins was on there
[01:03:25.040 --> 01:03:26.280]   and he was talking about, you know,
[01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:29.360]   it's 50K to do heart surgery and another 100K
[01:03:29.360 --> 01:03:32.480]   to if it gets complicated.
[01:03:32.480 --> 01:03:37.480]   And on the panel was a woman who was head of an Indian hospital
[01:03:37.480 --> 01:03:41.440]   and she says, well, we do heart surgery for $3,000
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:44.440]   to express, but that doesn't include the airfare.
[01:03:44.440 --> 01:03:49.440]   And they asked her, well, where did your head
[01:03:49.440 --> 01:03:52.000]   of cardiology graduate?
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:55.240]   And she said from Johns Hopkins.
[01:03:55.240 --> 01:03:58.680]   Now, but what's happening is over time,
[01:03:58.680 --> 01:04:01.720]   it will become more powerful if she says,
[01:04:01.720 --> 01:04:03.920]   well, actually graduated from the local university
[01:04:03.920 --> 01:04:05.720]   in Bangalore, which has been--
[01:04:05.720 --> 01:04:07.720]   Who are you gonna choose for your heart surgery?
[01:04:07.720 --> 01:04:10.160]   Well, the problem is that again,
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:13.280]   this is an age where true value comes to the form
[01:04:13.280 --> 01:04:14.440]   where things get evidence.
[01:04:14.440 --> 01:04:16.800]   But how do credentials the only way we have of doing that?
[01:04:16.800 --> 01:04:17.640]   No, but--
[01:04:17.640 --> 01:04:18.480]   Or data.
[01:04:18.480 --> 01:04:19.320]   Or data if we had--
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:20.160]   Like how many patients--
[01:04:20.160 --> 01:04:21.000]   That's fucked off.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:22.360]   (laughing)
[01:04:22.360 --> 01:04:23.560]   How do you get that data?
[01:04:23.560 --> 01:04:27.080]   Who are the first 100 people he operates on?
[01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:29.000]   Well, no, but we're not talking about,
[01:04:29.000 --> 01:04:32.160]   let's see, how many people he killed or not.
[01:04:32.160 --> 01:04:33.000]   Oh, okay.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.880]   To Jeff's point, I think there's all kinds of measures
[01:04:35.880 --> 01:04:36.720]   of being that--
[01:04:36.720 --> 01:04:37.560]   Okay, all right.
[01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:40.720]   This sort of precede the actual being
[01:04:40.720 --> 01:04:41.760]   in the operating room.
[01:04:41.760 --> 01:04:45.800]   And if the universities are proven to not be the best
[01:04:45.800 --> 01:04:50.600]   places, if there are other systems, other models
[01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:54.240]   of learning that over time show that they're superior,
[01:04:54.240 --> 01:04:56.640]   then the credentialing function is gonna vanish.
[01:04:56.640 --> 01:04:57.480]   Right, no, no.
[01:04:57.480 --> 01:05:00.680]   I wrote my book, Bob Weiman from Google in the comments,
[01:05:00.680 --> 01:05:02.440]   separated education into three things,
[01:05:02.440 --> 01:05:03.640]   I added a fourth.
[01:05:03.640 --> 01:05:06.600]   It's teaching, it's credentialing, it's research,
[01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:08.360]   and I added socialization.
[01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:10.880]   And those four things don't have to happen
[01:05:10.880 --> 01:05:12.640]   in the same quad, in the same buildings.
[01:05:12.640 --> 01:05:14.520]   They can be separated out, I think.
[01:05:14.520 --> 01:05:15.360]   Yeah.
[01:05:15.360 --> 01:05:17.280]   On the socialization, when Marvin Dresher
[01:05:17.280 --> 01:05:19.760]   was the head of sociology at Princeton,
[01:05:19.760 --> 01:05:21.680]   we were having a discussion about this awhile ago,
[01:05:21.680 --> 01:05:23.720]   and he says, "The great thing about a university,
[01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:25.480]   "it's a wonderful place for young people
[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:27.880]   "to go for four years and get older."
[01:05:27.880 --> 01:05:28.720]   (laughing)
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:30.320]   And he says, "They're bound to learn something
[01:05:30.320 --> 01:05:31.240]   "while they're there."
[01:05:31.240 --> 01:05:33.400]   But the thing is that if that's all they're doing
[01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:34.240]   is getting older.
[01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:35.240]   And smoking a little pie.
[01:05:35.240 --> 01:05:37.280]   Yeah, it's a pretty expensive camp.
[01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:38.120]   Yeah.
[01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:39.840]   You know, it's like $160,000.
[01:05:39.840 --> 01:05:40.680]   Yeah.
[01:05:40.680 --> 01:05:41.560]   A kid to go to camp.
[01:05:41.560 --> 01:05:42.400]   Yeah.
[01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:44.480]   Elmo's place university, yeah.
[01:05:44.480 --> 01:05:46.560]   Well, and I think one thing that people look at,
[01:05:46.560 --> 01:05:48.040]   a lot of the people who are founders
[01:05:48.040 --> 01:05:49.440]   of the technological revolution today
[01:05:49.440 --> 01:05:51.440]   did not graduate from college.
[01:05:51.440 --> 01:05:52.280]   Some of them like David.
[01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:53.760]   That's the model, that's the model for Jake.
[01:05:53.760 --> 01:05:56.560]   You look at Zuckerberg and Gates
[01:05:56.560 --> 01:06:00.120]   and graduate level, Sergei Hilari.
[01:06:00.120 --> 01:06:01.440]   Yeah.
[01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:03.240]   You know, pretty amazing.
[01:06:03.240 --> 01:06:04.080]   Gates.
[01:06:04.080 --> 01:06:05.000]   Yeah.
[01:06:05.000 --> 01:06:06.520]   Well, Jake, listen to your mother.
[01:06:06.520 --> 01:06:08.040]   She's from me, I have a point.
[01:06:08.040 --> 01:06:08.880]   (laughing)
[01:06:08.880 --> 01:06:11.600]   Just in case, just in case.
[01:06:11.600 --> 01:06:13.400]   You might wanna listen to your mother.
[01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:16.560]   What is this gender difference?
[01:06:16.560 --> 01:06:18.760]   You know, 'cause it was the very same thing in our family.
[01:06:18.760 --> 01:06:19.840]   I kept telling my kids,
[01:06:19.840 --> 01:06:21.560]   look, I don't care so much about your marks.
[01:06:21.560 --> 01:06:23.200]   I want you to have a passion to son.
[01:06:23.200 --> 01:06:24.040]   I'm Lucy Gusin.
[01:06:24.040 --> 01:06:25.240]   As long as you love learning.
[01:06:25.240 --> 01:06:26.920]   And my wife would say,
[01:06:26.920 --> 01:06:30.040]   don't listen to this jerk who's your father
[01:06:30.040 --> 01:06:31.680]   because you wanna get into it.
[01:06:31.680 --> 01:06:33.880]   And they've always been more practical.
[01:06:33.880 --> 01:06:35.080]   Women have had to fit.
[01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:35.920]   Am I right?
[01:06:35.920 --> 01:06:39.800]   I think women know that you're gonna starve to death
[01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:41.880]   and you better pay attention
[01:06:41.880 --> 01:06:42.720]   and guys are going around,
[01:06:42.720 --> 01:06:44.440]   yeah, but I wanna play the flute.
[01:06:44.440 --> 01:06:45.280]   (laughing)
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:47.440]   I wanna sit in that tree.
[01:06:47.440 --> 01:06:49.120]   I can be a professional athlete.
[01:06:49.120 --> 01:06:49.960]   Yeah.
[01:06:49.960 --> 01:06:51.240]   I'm gonna play ball, it's okay.
[01:06:51.240 --> 01:06:52.080]   That's what my son says.
[01:06:52.080 --> 01:06:53.160]   I might be able to have a guitar player.
[01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:55.000]   I'm gonna be a rock and roller.
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:56.760]   Gina Trapani, thank you so much for being here.
[01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:57.600]   You're just great.
[01:06:57.600 --> 01:07:00.600]   We're gonna, I guess I can kind of informally say
[01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:02.040]   that Gina and Jeff and I,
[01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:03.920]   I hope Jeff you will join us,
[01:07:03.920 --> 01:07:05.440]   are gonna start a Google show soon.
[01:07:05.440 --> 01:07:07.000]   It's gonna really be about cloud computing
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:08.520]   as much as Google.
[01:07:08.520 --> 01:07:11.720]   But boy, Google has given us a lot of stuff to talk about,
[01:07:11.720 --> 01:07:13.960]   not just last week, but over the last few years.
[01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:16.920]   And it's happening in the cloud.
[01:07:16.920 --> 01:07:18.440]   And I think it's gonna be a very interesting show.
[01:07:18.440 --> 01:07:19.960]   We'll start doing that.
[01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:21.280]   As soon as we can work out a time
[01:07:21.280 --> 01:07:23.400]   that works for you too.
[01:07:23.400 --> 01:07:24.240]   Can't wait.
[01:07:24.240 --> 01:07:27.280]   And maybe Jake, you'll stop by once in a while too, I hope.
[01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:28.120]   Sure.
[01:07:28.120 --> 01:07:29.120]   And let us know how that is.
[01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:30.080]   'Cause he knows more than I do.
[01:07:30.080 --> 01:07:31.360]   Sure, of course.
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:32.560]   They all do.
[01:07:32.560 --> 01:07:34.080]   And talk about GWT.
[01:07:34.080 --> 01:07:36.400]   Gina Trapani is at smarterware.org.
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:37.240]   That is her new site.
[01:07:37.240 --> 01:07:40.440]   She still, of course, writes for her original blog,
[01:07:40.440 --> 01:07:45.120]   Life Hacker, which has now grown into a amazing place.
[01:07:45.120 --> 01:07:45.960]   A monster.
[01:07:45.960 --> 01:07:47.360]   A monster.
[01:07:47.360 --> 01:07:48.680]   But yeah, I'm there once a week now.
[01:07:48.680 --> 01:07:51.840]   And on Twitter is Gina Trapani, T-R-A-P-A-N-I.
[01:07:51.840 --> 01:07:52.920]   So great to see you, Gina.
[01:07:52.920 --> 01:07:54.120]   Thank you for joining us today.
[01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:54.920]   Great to see you too.
[01:07:54.920 --> 01:07:55.520]   Thank you.
[01:07:55.520 --> 01:07:57.720]   Jeff, it was great having you and Studio with your son,
[01:07:57.720 --> 01:07:59.680]   first father son team.
[01:07:59.680 --> 01:08:00.720]   I'm honored to be here.
[01:08:00.720 --> 01:08:01.840]   I really appreciate it.
[01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:04.240]   It's the only show I could be on that would impress Jake.
[01:08:04.240 --> 01:08:06.120]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:08:06.120 --> 01:08:09.760]   I hope we've helped you with your son.
[01:08:09.760 --> 01:08:12.240]   Jake, it's great to have you two.
[01:08:12.240 --> 01:08:13.600]   Where do you want people to go?
[01:08:13.600 --> 01:08:15.360]   JakeJarvis.com is at the place.
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:15.760]   All right.
[01:08:15.760 --> 01:08:20.760]   And you are also on the Twitter as Jake Jarvis.
[01:08:20.760 --> 01:08:21.280]   Yeah.
[01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:21.800]   Thanks, Leah.
[01:08:21.800 --> 01:08:24.040]   Is Twitter your place still or Facebook?
[01:08:24.040 --> 01:08:25.840]   Where would you spend most of your time?
[01:08:25.840 --> 01:08:26.720]   Mostly Twitter.
[01:08:26.720 --> 01:08:27.240]   Yeah.
[01:08:27.240 --> 01:08:29.120]   I'm become a big friend feed fan.
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:29.600]   I don't know why.
[01:08:29.600 --> 01:08:30.880]   I like that real time.
[01:08:30.880 --> 01:08:31.720]   Yeah, I have to try that.
[01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:33.800]   Oh, it's awesome.
[01:08:33.800 --> 01:08:36.600]   By the way, let's not forget Jeff's book.
[01:08:36.600 --> 01:08:37.920]   We've got to pay the college bills.
[01:08:37.920 --> 01:08:40.040]   What would Google do, ladies and gentlemen,
[01:08:40.040 --> 01:08:42.440]   a great book about a great company
[01:08:42.440 --> 01:08:46.960]   and how it is that they can inspire your company as well.
[01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:50.880]   And it is available now from Collins Business.
[01:08:50.880 --> 01:08:53.360]   And of course, Don Tapscott, thank you for being in studio
[01:08:53.360 --> 01:08:53.720]   with us.
[01:08:53.720 --> 01:08:56.800]   It's really great to have you come all this way.
[01:08:56.800 --> 01:08:59.520]   Don's book, his latest, although there's a new one on the way,
[01:08:59.520 --> 01:09:00.520]   is grown up.
[01:09:00.520 --> 01:09:02.240]   Do you want to talk about the new book at all?
[01:09:02.240 --> 01:09:02.960]   Sure.
[01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:05.440]   What's it about?
[01:09:05.440 --> 01:09:08.360]   It's a modest little thing called rebuilding the world.
[01:09:08.360 --> 01:09:09.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:11.440]   Yeah, we didn't get into it.
[01:09:11.440 --> 01:09:12.200]   We've run out of time.
[01:09:12.200 --> 01:09:15.040]   We didn't get into the new cybers are,
[01:09:15.040 --> 01:09:20.080]   what the Obama administration is doing in terms of technology,
[01:09:20.080 --> 01:09:22.680]   and the constraints that it's running up against as well
[01:09:22.680 --> 01:09:23.880]   and making major changes.
[01:09:23.880 --> 01:09:26.640]   It's not an easy thing to do.
[01:09:26.640 --> 01:09:28.440]   Growing up digital was the first,
[01:09:28.440 --> 01:09:29.960]   this is the new and grown up digital.
[01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:31.160]   And I highly recommend it.
[01:09:31.160 --> 01:09:34.760]   It's really a great insight into the future
[01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:36.800]   and what our kids are going to face
[01:09:36.800 --> 01:09:39.000]   and what our kids are today.
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:41.720]   And somebody like Jake does not need to read this.
[01:09:41.720 --> 01:09:43.480]   You're living it, dude.
[01:09:43.480 --> 01:09:44.520]   Thank you, Don, for coming in.
[01:09:44.520 --> 01:09:45.240]   I really appreciate it.
[01:09:45.240 --> 01:09:45.720]   My pleasure.
[01:09:45.720 --> 01:09:46.760]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:09:46.760 --> 01:09:48.040]   We've enjoyed the conversation.

[01:10:12.120 --> 01:10:13.120]   Is in the can.
[01:10:13.120 --> 01:10:16.120]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[01:10:16.120 --> 01:10:23.120]   Round the board.
[01:10:23.120 --> 01:10:30.120]   Round the board.
[01:10:30.120 --> 01:10:35.120]   Round the board.
[01:10:35.120 --> 01:10:37.700]   (upbeat music)
