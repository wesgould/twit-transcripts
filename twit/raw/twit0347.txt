[00:03:32.740 --> 00:03:36.700]   Also here for the first time we've got a newbie. I'm really pleased to welcome
[00:03:36.700 --> 00:03:43.020]   Wilson tech one Lamar Wilson is here, and he's the king is the king he's been he's been to Burger King
[00:03:43.020 --> 00:03:45.940]   I have he's well said I am the king of the web
[00:03:46.420 --> 00:03:52.300]   I know Lamar. I would say it looks like yeah, you're not trying to steal someone's distinctive look right now, are you?
[00:03:52.300 --> 00:04:01.700]   We should all have spiked something that's a very nice crayon. It looks like it's made of foam rubber however
[00:04:01.700 --> 00:04:03.700]   I gotta say it's actually hurting my head
[00:04:03.700 --> 00:04:15.300]   Does a great show now on revision three look at just go to youtube.com/wilsintech1 or revision three.com and you find out more about that
[00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.060]   He's he says by his own admission the funniest
[00:04:18.060 --> 00:04:25.500]   Tech guy on the air also the most humble and the most humble. Yes. Yeah, I strive for humility
[00:04:25.500 --> 00:04:37.260]   But you guys don't call unless you're ready to book yeah, he charges you just for just for talking goes for
[00:04:37.260 --> 00:04:42.740]   So there's a reason why we have this group here on this day. This is April. This is April fools
[00:04:43.420 --> 00:04:47.260]   And John C. Devorak is famous for his April fools. You know the promise
[00:04:47.260 --> 00:04:48.580]   I think these the whole things being ruined
[00:04:48.580 --> 00:04:53.500]   I mean I do have an announcement to make that it really has nothing to do with it which I probably should mention well
[00:04:53.500 --> 00:04:58.620]   Okay, would now be a good time. I get out of the way. I've decided I used to always you know
[00:04:58.620 --> 00:05:03.220]   I'm a notorious independent voter. Yeah, but you're gonna go down all Democrats
[00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:04.700]   I've decided to go Democrat
[00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:09.460]   Yeah, and I've been we've got a bunch of money from a super pack and we've gone to this website
[00:05:09.460 --> 00:05:14.280]   We put up a website because we're really pushing this here it goes Ramini sucks. Dot org
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.100]   S you cks yeah, Ramini sucks dot org and that's the essentially our
[00:05:19.100 --> 00:05:30.580]   That would be the you're not helping my pitch for why April fools day is Christmas of the I hate
[00:05:30.580 --> 00:05:37.300]   So John's an April Foolster go to Ramini sucks dot org at home folks. You'll you'll be very pleased
[00:05:38.620 --> 00:05:43.300]   By the way, Brahini staff pulled an April Fool's joke on him. Did you see that? No, what did they do?
[00:05:43.300 --> 00:05:46.340]   I have to find it, but while we're doing that I'm gonna explain why you're all here
[00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:50.620]   Mr. Scam School himself the the author of the scam school book
[00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:55.860]   He doesn't show scam school revision 3 Brian brushwood is not is a professional prankster
[00:05:55.860 --> 00:06:01.100]   I mean that's essentially what a magician so he actually does nothing on April fools. All I do is take credit for things
[00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:04.660]   I didn't actually do yeah, that's all magicians do well. I mean I
[00:06:04.660 --> 00:06:06.900]   think that
[00:06:06.900 --> 00:06:12.860]   You know you might take the day off because it's kind of amateur hour, right? Oh, dude. I look here's the thing dude
[00:06:12.860 --> 00:06:22.380]   Everybody in internet news seems to hate April fools day except for me like to me
[00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:27.380]   This is all my favorite websites spend time and effort to package something that they hope will make me smile
[00:06:27.380 --> 00:06:30.220]   And it's like I love it, man. I love seeing all the different
[00:06:30.220 --> 00:06:34.540]   I love seeing the products on think geek. I love seeing the they Google goes all out man
[00:06:34.540 --> 00:06:37.980]   I think Google over does it. I think they overdo it with a problem one good gag
[00:06:37.980 --> 00:06:43.560]   They got too many divisions and each division has their own idea that something they want to do so Romney's
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:45.580]   Romney's staff
[00:06:45.580 --> 00:06:48.660]   Got them all set for what they said it was a pancake breakfast
[00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:54.300]   You know the often begins Sundays with pancake breakfast with supporters waffles and said
[00:06:54.300 --> 00:07:02.660]   What a great gag representative Paul Ryan walks. He's backstage with Paul Ryan Ryan walks out introduces
[00:07:04.060 --> 00:07:08.140]   Romney he's backstage with the senator Johnson of Wisconsin
[00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:15.260]   They have the secret service protection there Romney standing behind a black curtain Ryan gives his big endorsement
[00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:18.580]   Praise applause filters backstage
[00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:24.620]   Romney walks out. There's no one there. Oh my god. That's an empty room
[00:07:24.620 --> 00:07:28.460]   So they haven't posted the video yet, but I apparently they did have the video

[00:10:17.540 --> 00:10:26.140]   Alright, so I think what we should do here's here's what we should do. I will go through a list of stories
[00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:29.340]   Some will be real. Okay. I like some will be April fools jokes
[00:10:29.340 --> 00:10:31.820]   And then you can tell me
[00:10:31.820 --> 00:10:38.740]   You can make save me from reporting it is news sure you said yourself. This is you never been tricked
[00:10:38.740 --> 00:10:42.900]   I don't think I think I have a pretty good for I'm I'm not cuz I'm very conservative when something
[00:10:42.980 --> 00:10:46.060]   When I feel like something doesn't smell right I immediately
[00:10:46.060 --> 00:10:53.720]   suspicious I'll tell you what else is the real fallout is years later when you find some of these old stories and you think
[00:10:53.720 --> 00:10:57.940]   Yeah, I promise when you see them out of context on the wrong day, right?
[00:10:57.940 --> 00:11:02.380]   That's the problem with the Internet and that's the problem with the Internet. It is it's a real problem
[00:11:02.380 --> 00:11:07.540]   I have seen people pull old jokes out as as fact. I mean a friend of mine just wrote one
[00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:10.500]   Today this which I thought was quite good
[00:11:11.860 --> 00:11:13.380]   saying that
[00:11:13.380 --> 00:11:15.380]   the government has the
[00:11:15.380 --> 00:11:20.740]   All offices of government all have to have a Facebook. They have to do other logins with the Facebook logins
[00:11:20.740 --> 00:11:27.060]   It's like a spot of it. It's funny. It's very funny. That's Roger struck off. I'll give him credit for that
[00:11:27.060 --> 00:11:30.340]   Here's one. I honestly don't know if it's a April Fool story or not
[00:11:30.340 --> 00:11:32.340]   I'll post it to you Leo in the chat room
[00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:37.780]   But it's from BBC and it says email and web use to be monitored under new laws
[00:11:37.900 --> 00:11:43.020]   The governments will be able to monitor the calls emails texts of website visits of everyone in the UK under a new legislation
[00:11:43.020 --> 00:11:47.620]   Said to be announced soon. I say that's true. That's true. That's true. What?
[00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:50.700]   This is a word. This is the worst thing ever is
[00:11:50.700 --> 00:11:57.260]   According squirrel in our chat room says sadly that is true. Why even released this story on April 1st?
[00:11:57.260 --> 00:12:05.580]   That's my stupid. They are that's my problem. They're April Fool the idea of April Fool's Day is not a part of English
[00:12:05.900 --> 00:12:09.660]   culture. Well, that's what's interesting because I think this is an American phenomenon
[00:12:09.660 --> 00:12:11.980]   This is an event though. I agree, but it is now celebrated
[00:12:11.980 --> 00:12:14.460]   What may be not an American phenomenon? I don't know where it came from originally
[00:12:14.460 --> 00:12:18.940]   Did you see a Simpsons episode? I seems like it's everywhere. Yeah, but I think it's international at this point
[00:12:18.940 --> 00:12:22.700]   I don't think so. So how many April Fool's jokes did Google do?
[00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:27.900]   It seems like that's all they've been working on for all they do. They're stock prices
[00:12:27.900 --> 00:12:33.180]   plummeting because they can't think of anything with April Fool seems like that's all they've worked on go to maps
[00:12:33.820 --> 00:12:38.460]   Google.com this is my favorite way good. It's way. This seems like they put a lot of effort
[00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:43.100]   Oh, they're going to cheese one. No, no, no, look video is awesome. Okay, you got to watch the video
[00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:45.100]   But but they've got they announced um
[00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:48.060]   Maps for the nes for the Nintendo
[00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:54.300]   Sistemics interesting is in the video you could tell this was all made for the Japanese audience because they don't show an NES
[00:12:54.300 --> 00:12:59.660]   They show a family calm and they have a Japanese family there now by the way. I'm by the way
[00:12:59.660 --> 00:13:04.460]   Provise I'm just gonna say one thing here. I am running a Google promotional video
[00:13:04.460 --> 00:13:07.420]   On YouTube. I did this
[00:13:07.420 --> 00:13:14.460]   On twig on this week in google on wednesday and they pulled our video down saying we violated their copyright. Wow. Oh, you're kidding
[00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:21.740]   Now if they pull this video down this cost me thousands and thousands of views in other words many thousands of dollars
[00:13:21.740 --> 00:13:27.580]   This is ridiculous. This is a promotion for them. It's also news and it's also a news app. Good point
[00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:29.820]   It's also news totally fair
[00:13:29.820 --> 00:13:36.060]   We we appealed and they put it back. Did it stay back or did they pull it down again because there's a whole process
[00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:41.020]   These are the game briefly. Yeah, this is the kind of idiots that run these companies today
[00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:43.260]   Well, anyway, uh, so I'm now running
[00:13:43.260 --> 00:13:48.700]   This is this is a tens of thousand dollar risk. I'm about to go for it gamble roll those dice Leo
[00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:52.780]   From desktop computers to mobile devices including tablets
[00:13:53.500 --> 00:14:00.380]   But we've long neglected one of the most popular computer systems ever sold and i'm here to introduce google maps
[00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:03.180]   a big version of the first product for NES
[00:14:03.180 --> 00:14:10.300]   It's it's well first we developed a new type of cartridge with dial-up technology
[00:14:10.300 --> 00:14:17.100]   Allowing the ns to connect to google dial-up check now you run more than a hundred thousand servers to overcome the ns
[00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:19.260]   technical limitations
[00:14:19.260 --> 00:14:22.620]   It be maps are generated by google's cloud in real time
[00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:25.900]   Here's the demonstration
[00:14:25.900 --> 00:14:31.260]   Insert the cartridge connect the cable and turn the power on
[00:14:31.260 --> 00:14:37.980]   Blow on the cartridge to fix bugs
[00:14:37.980 --> 00:14:40.940]   That's really that. Oh, yeah
[00:14:40.940 --> 00:14:42.940]   internet
[00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:47.020]   Blow on the cartridge to fix bugs
[00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:51.340]   Select search and enter in a more place just like the regular
[00:14:51.340 --> 00:14:54.940]   So this all actually works if you go to well, that's what's incredible
[00:14:54.940 --> 00:14:58.780]   Including the the historical landmarks like if you go to washington dc
[00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:03.740]   They'd have a little cartoon white house there. This is where I was blown away. They must have some sort of programmatic
[00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:07.260]   uh thing in here that they they were able to
[00:15:07.260 --> 00:15:12.780]   View eight bit landmarks that they were able to automatically unless somebody spent a whole year
[00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:15.660]   Go ahead and type in like washington dc and take a look around that area
[00:15:15.660 --> 00:15:20.460]   All right here because that's of course very distinctive and you can see that it really does look like if they were going to make an rpg
[00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:22.860]   for the nes
[00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:28.460]   Look at this. This is very elaborate and when you and by the way, you can zoom there. It is that look yeah
[00:15:28.460 --> 00:15:34.140]   This is very elaborate take the little quest guy and throw him on a street and he'll go into street view
[00:15:34.140 --> 00:15:41.180]   Where's the quest guy right there? Oh here drag throw him on a street. Oh, let's see what the white house looks like an eight bit
[00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:44.540]   There he is
[00:15:44.540 --> 00:15:49.260]   Is he doing it or there we go. Wow. That has all eight bit style graphics
[00:15:49.260 --> 00:15:55.020]   So they clearly did some of this programmatically. Yeah, obviously they took the real street view and right they
[00:15:55.020 --> 00:15:57.980]   They degraded it. This is pretty impressive. Right
[00:15:57.980 --> 00:16:03.900]   Or do they have too much time on their hands? Well, that's what i'm wondering that seems like seems like I mean
[00:16:03.900 --> 00:16:06.220]   This is just one of perhaps a dozen
[00:16:06.220 --> 00:16:11.340]   Well, they also you know google's got that culture where they build in time off for side projects
[00:16:11.340 --> 00:16:15.100]   And I think they get a tremendous amount of goodwill and PR from these kind of initiatives
[00:16:15.100 --> 00:16:18.380]   Not some of them fall flat some of them aren't as good as the others like they got the um
[00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:21.740]   Uh, I didn't think the google morse code was quite as good. How about this one?
[00:16:21.740 --> 00:16:26.860]   This this video was pretty good racing introducing our autonomous race car partnership with nascar
[00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:34.140]   And the best thing is the back of the uh, the back of the google car has a sign that says i'm driving lucky
[00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:37.340]   And and he shows the driver with his hands out the window
[00:16:37.340 --> 00:16:41.180]   Is that Larry or sir? Yeah, it's one of them. Is it really? Yeah. Yeah
[00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:44.380]   Oh, it's it's uh, sir. Yeah, that's sir. Oh my gosh
[00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:50.700]   If you watch the the video half of it is uh, you could tell it's nascar people playing along with saying all the time
[00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:55.260]   It's going to save them, but then the other half is very clearly them going up to people at nascar
[00:16:55.260 --> 00:17:00.460]   Tailgators and telling them like it's real and you get their real reactions. Well, I think that i'm sure that's funny
[00:17:00.460 --> 00:17:04.220]   Add here so they get they get some money from the ads. They also get
[00:17:04.220 --> 00:17:07.260]   uh promotion for their autonomous vehicle programs
[00:17:07.260 --> 00:17:12.220]   So which I think it's not a coincidence that we saw the first video publicly showing you know
[00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:14.460]   We had was that this week or the week the blind guy?
[00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:20.300]   Yeah, the blind guy that's the one I got pulled off of uh, that twig got pulled down for because we showed that and I thought it was great
[00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:22.380]   Oh, it's fantastic. Uh, but i
[00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:28.140]   As much as I am willing to take a chance. I am not willing to show that video again. So I just invite you to go see it
[00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:34.140]   I think the the youtube collection was just awesome. That's a fun one too. Let's get let's pull that one up here because
[00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:38.460]   That one is that one you could you could almost believe was true. No
[00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:41.020]   sadly
[00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:44.220]   I didn't enjoy all the cameos from the youtube celebrities at the end
[00:17:44.220 --> 00:17:53.820]   Right link in there possible video experience on the internet, but that is all about the winner our latest innovation gives you a way to literally hold youtube in your hand

[00:19:39.020 --> 00:19:41.980]   Is it micro where there any microsoft
[00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:43.980]   YouTube collection on jokes
[00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:49.100]   Simple i'll tell you what that's i don't know a chatroom with any microsoft videos maybe they're stock price
[00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:51.820]   Oh, hey
[00:19:51.820 --> 00:19:59.420]   I would actually love to see some kind of algorithmic correlation between what kind of companies put in the time and effort to do april fools pranks
[00:19:59.420 --> 00:20:03.980]   And how they perform or how they're perceived in the market because my guess is that's part of the reason you view
[00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:10.060]   Microsoft is being stuck up and behind the times and one of the reasons google did they've done more this year than they have done
[00:20:10.060 --> 00:20:14.700]   They've done way just too many there's so many now there's one that was pulled down
[00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:19.260]   Which i'm kind of sad because it was actually very funny, but maybe it was just deemed to be in bad taste
[00:20:19.260 --> 00:20:22.220]   I'm talking about the weather control. Did you see that one? No, I missed it
[00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:25.660]   I missed it too. Is it possible because they're actually revealing a fact
[00:20:25.660 --> 00:20:29.340]   This is not no agenda. So when you searched for a
[00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:31.740]   locale
[00:20:31.740 --> 00:20:33.740]   It was that what it was called to john do we have any
[00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:36.940]   I couldn't find that one
[00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:40.220]   Look at images. I am and they're all pulled down
[00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:44.700]   They're all pulled down. Yeah, wait a minute. Here's one
[00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:48.380]   Wait, there we go
[00:20:49.180 --> 00:20:54.700]   You know what I think they pulled them down hold on I I did this this this is what it looked like
[00:20:54.700 --> 00:20:58.620]   Um, you would enter in a search result whether one double o one six
[00:20:58.620 --> 00:21:04.860]   And you would don't like the weather now you can change it in your region by selecting from the drop down to change precipitation
[00:21:04.860 --> 00:21:08.460]   And setting your own temperature so you'd set the temperature set the precipitation
[00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:14.700]   You'd press update weather it'll give you a warning warning you're about to actually change the weather in this region
[00:21:15.740 --> 00:21:20.300]   That's pretty awesome that people really think this was real. They must have because it's gone
[00:21:20.300 --> 00:21:26.540]   In fact most of the images that I saw earlier today in image search are gone john
[00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:32.300]   I still have mine. See I changed our weather so we were having 85 degrees. Oh nice day
[00:21:32.300 --> 00:21:35.900]   I I wonder if there's a story there. That's very interesting that it's
[00:21:35.900 --> 00:21:42.060]   Sounds like no agenda to me google google doesn't just go. I mean, I'm sure they go bug nutty during April fools
[00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:44.060]   But they're doing stuff all year round like you say
[00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:49.500]   Yeah bug nutty. Huh. They uh, they uh, they did like a just go to google.com. You type do a barrel roll
[00:21:49.500 --> 00:21:50.780]   Do you remember seeing that that was fun?
[00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:53.980]   And they were it's been around. They had some other stuff. They have a sense of humor
[00:21:53.980 --> 00:21:58.940]   And you're right it makes you see a little gram if you tried searching for anagram still work. Uh, yeah
[00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:04.860]   I'm sure it says are you sure you means you didn't mean there you go anagram. Did you mean naga ram is what it says?
[00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:11.740]   Did you mean naga ram that's pretty funny. That's but I got a I got to say the most
[00:22:11.980 --> 00:22:13.980]   Um, the one I had fun with
[00:22:13.980 --> 00:22:16.140]   Reading about the most was really the google fiber
[00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:22.780]   Because you know being sick this week. I really needed something to kind of cleanse the colon and make me feel good
[00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:27.900]   So, you know taking a bite of that google fire fiber. It just you know, bile's just flew right through me
[00:22:27.900 --> 00:22:33.980]   It was just great. So I'll just play a little bit of the first bit of the video on this so you can see what he's talking about here
[00:22:33.980 --> 00:22:36.300]   Otherwise, I sound very weird. Yes you do
[00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:39.500]   I don't know if there's any help. Hi
[00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:42.300]   My name is ben segura and i'm on the google fiber team
[00:22:42.300 --> 00:22:47.740]   We have heard a lot of rumors that we've been building a fiber optic network that will deliver internet speeds
[00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:50.700]   100 times faster than most americans have access to today
[00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:53.420]   And while we are humbled by these speculations
[00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:58.540]   We have focused our efforts on developing a different kind of fiber google fiber
[00:22:58.540 --> 00:23:01.980]   Here at google we try to solve big problems
[00:23:01.980 --> 00:23:08.700]   They they've got very uh high quality tanda gazas is uh avoid the dark fiber though
[00:23:09.500 --> 00:23:16.060]   So apparently there is according to neo win there is a uh april fools joke
[00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:21.260]   Perhaps this is the microsoft april fools joke it uh
[00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:30.380]   That is a joke. Yeah, I don't think this is obscure. This is not helping this is obscure master sky drive
[00:23:30.380 --> 00:23:35.740]   Exactly what you would expect the character from the apple ads to pick you some pretty april fool. Wow
[00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:39.580]   Uh apparently maybe this is maybe it's kind of a reverse
[00:23:39.580 --> 00:23:44.300]   April Fool's show to make them look like it sky drives command line
[00:23:44.300 --> 00:23:48.140]   Sky drive boy. This is this is a hoot. What?
[00:23:48.140 --> 00:23:50.300]   boy
[00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:52.300]   Just uh, that's that's just
[00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:53.900]   Stiracle
[00:23:53.900 --> 00:24:00.620]   Yeah, wow, uh type log in well command line interface. That's hilarious microsoft again
[00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:04.540]   Oh, that could rebill gates all over this. Uh, yeah
[00:24:05.340 --> 00:24:08.460]   Um, I think that tells you a little bit something doesn't it?
[00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:12.860]   Um that this was that this was you know compare that to the effort that
[00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:19.420]   Google put in the movies the videos and the sense of humor a couple of those were just where you they're well produced
[00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:25.180]   Uh allow and access and edit your sky drive photos and documents. Yeah, I'm a little this is a little bizarre
[00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:32.220]   I do in fact have command line access. I can't type LS not that'd be quite fun if they call jimson. No, this is actually
[00:24:33.180 --> 00:24:40.140]   My sky is a command line interface. Yeah, that's amazing. Yeah, let's just uh, let's just cd to uh, can you can you
[00:24:40.140 --> 00:24:44.380]   Actually execute a photo or something. Yeah, let's see uh, d. I
[00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:50.220]   Execute this joke. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah as the professional comic in the bunch
[00:24:50.220 --> 00:24:52.220]   Um
[00:24:52.220 --> 00:24:57.900]   Let's I don't I don't I have some documents in here. I think okay. Wow. This is getting really tedious really fast
[00:24:57.900 --> 00:25:00.060]   Come on. Come on guys, you know
[00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:04.940]   Okay, dr doesn't seem to work or you change the director. You're not to do that. What you remember all these old things
[00:25:04.940 --> 00:25:09.980]   See they brought the actual windows that are faced to the command line
[00:25:09.980 --> 00:25:14.300]   So that's kind of cool because it actually does work. I mean, that's my actual sky drive data
[00:25:14.300 --> 00:25:17.340]   Yeah, I couldn't actually execute anything or see anything. Well, I didn't get
[00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:19.420]   I'm sure I could if I go to the right place. Let's see
[00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:23.420]   Very clever thought Microsoft cd skydrive
[00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:27.420]   At least it has used the tab leo yet it works it works
[00:25:28.380 --> 00:25:30.380]   There you go. Uh download

[00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:41.180]   Uh and there it is. It worked. That worked. That is kind of cool
[00:25:41.180 --> 00:25:44.300]   No, there you have it
[00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:48.780]   It's the definition of uncool Brian and now what it makes you cool
[00:25:48.780 --> 00:25:53.100]   That is the eight yeah, full stroke from from Microsoft
[00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:57.260]   But it's key to obviously that written by professional comics

[00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:18.700]   april fools joker true story ashton kutcher to play steve jobs riley magazine
[00:29:18.700 --> 00:29:25.420]   Says that he is signed in the indy pick jobs. This is not the one based on the isakson's book
[00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:28.460]   That's uh, sony bought that right into that
[00:29:28.460 --> 00:29:33.020]   Well, here's that lasting boogie boogie ahead chal get my house i'd say i'd say gag
[00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:35.020]   gag
[00:29:35.020 --> 00:29:39.980]   i'll say it's real no i say it's real he's at that he's at that point in his career where i bet he would love to uh
[00:29:40.140 --> 00:29:42.940]   Oh, i know he would like it i bet you he made the story up
[00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:49.020]   I know this looked like pretty good. I would ever go with that. Why would you think ashton kutcher were trying to get attention?
[00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:53.180]   Yeah, good point about this one
[00:29:53.180 --> 00:30:00.140]   Tim warstahl writing forbs.com apple claims paten writes to the rectangle i believe that's to be true
[00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:04.940]   Uh, this is actually comes from the register initially
[00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:09.020]   uh paten 1,142,000 and 12
[00:30:09.820 --> 00:30:13.020]   And uh, he says there is prior art
[00:30:13.020 --> 00:30:22.300]   When we sued samson an april of last year apple said one of our assertions was the company had modified its original design to include square icons with rounded corners
[00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:24.940]   That were copied directly from our ios icons
[00:30:24.940 --> 00:30:30.620]   So how much of a legal leap is it from the assertion of owning squares with rounded corners to asserting we own the rectangle
[00:30:30.620 --> 00:30:36.780]   All right, I think that's a joke close for that. That's not even close to be too to funny
[00:30:37.820 --> 00:30:44.140]   Not even not even close. How about the nokia ice the new super coal phone from nokia research
[00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:50.300]   All right, we know that's not true. Yeah, how about this?
[00:30:50.300 --> 00:30:55.580]   Wait, what are you what are you playing? What are you playing? I have an asteroid is this an mmo? Yes
[00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:58.300]   And they just got me
[00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:01.180]   This is mmo asteroids mmo
[00:31:01.180 --> 00:31:07.340]   Mmo steroids mmostroids mostroids. I don't know if it's an april fools joke. It seems to be real
[00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:11.900]   I think it's great. Yeah, cool. Yeah, and I think that there are other people playing it
[00:31:11.900 --> 00:31:14.380]   But I don't know what the keys are so i'm gonna get screwed
[00:31:14.380 --> 00:31:19.660]   What's great as they could tell because you watch them all circle in and yeah, they knew immediately as soon as I joined and they go
[00:31:19.660 --> 00:31:21.820]   That guy's an idiot
[00:31:21.820 --> 00:31:29.900]   All right, that's mmo steroids from seb.l y. All right, it's cool. See this is the game of the year. I am so excited
[00:31:29.900 --> 00:31:35.900]   Ladies and gentlemen watch this closely because I think you're gonna want this as much as me when you uh, this is available

[00:31:41.980 --> 00:31:45.100]   awesome game
[00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:47.740]   And their enemies still breed
[00:31:47.740 --> 00:31:55.660]   Watch this is gonna blow your mind. Oh, no. So my quest continues
[00:31:55.660 --> 00:32:02.620]   I cannot rest until all has been revealed
[00:32:04.460 --> 00:32:07.020]   Look at that climbing along the road
[00:32:07.020 --> 00:32:11.260]   This is this is a joke, right?
[00:32:11.260 --> 00:32:13.260]   You know, she is flying
[00:32:13.260 --> 00:32:16.780]   Look at that. Look at that. Watch the kill move. Oh
[00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:23.980]   Yep, she's a good archer. See that she's aiming. She's shooting. He just jams him right in the gut there
[00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:27.020]   This is a joke. No, this is real. This is real
[00:32:27.020 --> 00:32:30.380]   Watch look. She's hiding in a haystack
[00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:32.380]   Oh
[00:32:32.380 --> 00:32:45.420]   Uh-oh, look at that. Look at that
[00:32:45.420 --> 00:32:49.100]   Can't wait
[00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:54.860]   This is what connect this is the game connect was made to play he's sitting
[00:32:58.860 --> 00:33:02.700]   Okay, remove all furniture before playing the game. This is my favorite by the way
[00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:12.300]   Oh, I love this. Oh
[00:33:12.300 --> 00:33:19.340]   Actually when that thing when the connect first came out, this is pretty much my
[00:33:19.340 --> 00:33:22.460]   Play those weak controllers that just
[00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:25.420]   Slub in there. That's awesome. They can do it too
[00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:30.140]   That's that was a fan video. That's to me. This is the best april fools of
[00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:35.980]   Good gig because at first I believed it. I said, I cannot wait you you would like wait me
[00:33:35.980 --> 00:33:39.420]   You think that's not credible? I think you just I just think that you you
[00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:45.740]   Flap a lot of gums about how you hate april fools. Yeah, and you've never been watching all of our favorite videos
[00:33:45.740 --> 00:33:48.540]   All right, there's a few more
[00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:54.460]   So what do you do if you're a major company you're filed for chapter 11 the employees are all grim and glum
[00:33:55.180 --> 00:33:59.580]   You put out this you start drinking print your own live kittens new from codac
[00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:02.620]   It's fun fast and easy
[00:34:02.620 --> 00:34:05.980]   Got the guys who put some of these websites together should be
[00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:08.860]   What's sad is
[00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:11.020]   Yes, he's dark filing for chapter 11
[00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:13.340]   In fact right at the bottom it says codac
[00:34:13.340 --> 00:34:16.460]   Well, actually it had when I looked at it. It actually said
[00:34:16.460 --> 00:34:22.380]   Kodak receives court approval for completed debtor in possession financing. It's like this is real
[00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:27.980]   Um the windows actually that was a codac gag. They didn't want to get it from the codac page nice work
[00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:30.940]   Yeah, don't you like that? Yeah, I did like it. Yeah
[00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:34.380]   Taco Bell buys the actual liberty bell
[00:34:34.380 --> 00:34:38.700]   You know that taco bells use this gag over the years
[00:34:38.700 --> 00:34:44.380]   They got into trouble for saying they wanted they were gonna buy the rights to it to the naming and call it the taco liberty
[00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:47.740]   And like remember that some years ago you remember that no I love that
[00:34:47.740 --> 00:34:53.660]   It's like did you see that reddit now has reddit timeline that goes all the way back into the past but also into the future
[00:34:53.660 --> 00:34:56.860]   And it's fully populated with stories all the way
[00:34:56.860 --> 00:35:02.540]   Reddit should have something really awesome. This is something new from gmail. It's called gmail tap
[00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:09.180]   26 key keyboard into that space. It's so many keys. I feel constricted by the keyboard
[00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:14.380]   I just feel very overwhelmed. There's so many buttons. It's time to think about how can we do this better
[00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:17.020]   Using the technology that we have today
[00:35:17.660 --> 00:35:19.660]   And that's where gmail tap comes in
[00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:23.900]   It's a better way to type always known that i was related to sammy left b morse
[00:35:23.900 --> 00:35:31.260]   He's my great grandfather's grandfather's brother when read morse first came to my office and he said he had an idea for
[00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:33.660]   bringing morse code back
[00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:41.260]   I got really excited the ham you should replace the default keyboard in the gmail application with one that only has two buttons
[00:35:41.740 --> 00:35:43.740]   Two keys not or dead
[00:35:43.740 --> 00:35:51.260]   Can be spelled using just those two commands morse code is perfect. It's just a dot and a dash
[00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:56.620]   What's simpler than that? You know what's great about this? This does actually mock a lot of the apple
[00:35:56.620 --> 00:36:00.940]   One button stuff. Yeah, sure input on the phone faster. Oh wait
[00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:06.300]   Do you say ll cool jubbell the speed again by doubling the number of keyboards you have you can actually split your screen
[00:36:07.580 --> 00:36:13.900]   Two messages points to two completely different recipients gmail tap multitasking. It's an improvement over speech
[00:36:13.900 --> 00:36:19.420]   I like the music in the background. It is. It's very apple. This is another multitask. This is the google chrome group
[00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:24.140]   Showing how to browse with multiple cursors at the same time. It's called
[00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:31.820]   Hi, i'm glenn murphy and i'm a designer on google chrome when we're on the web we're always trying to get more done faster
[00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:36.460]   But researchers showing that most people don't really save time when they try to do multiple things at once
[00:36:37.020 --> 00:36:42.140]   On the chrome team. We don't think this is a problem with people. We think it's a problem with the tools. They have at their disposal
[00:36:42.140 --> 00:36:47.100]   We realized that any one time while browsing you're only using 50 of your hands
[00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:49.740]   Why because you only have one mouse
[00:36:49.740 --> 00:36:56.540]   Chrome multitask mode changes that by giving you access to not one but two mice at the same is that actually work
[00:36:56.540 --> 00:37:01.900]   It's got a tri-multim - it first might be a little tricky to get the hang of steering to mice in my after a short period of time
[00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:03.980]   It feels completely
[00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:09.660]   As an architect if i make a mistake it's a matter of life and death
[00:37:09.660 --> 00:37:14.780]   multitask mode has taken the stress off because i'm no longer thinking too hard about any one project
[00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:21.420]   We only have one computer between us and we used to fight and fight over who got to use the internet first
[00:37:21.420 --> 00:37:24.380]   Well now we don't have to wait or take turns anymore
[00:37:24.380 --> 00:37:29.340]   With multitask mode we can both check our email at the same time on the same computer
[00:37:29.340 --> 00:37:32.300]   Who's david security
[00:37:34.780 --> 00:37:38.860]   So i don't know what if i click that i'm clicking on oh look i've got yes it works
[00:37:38.860 --> 00:37:44.300]   All right
[00:37:44.300 --> 00:37:47.660]   We have multitask mode helps that's pretty good. That's pretty good. That's awesome
[00:37:47.660 --> 00:37:53.340]   So these were all they had that came out and looked at both mice you missed that little there's a frame where the guy came out and looked at both of your mice
[00:37:53.340 --> 00:37:54.300]   Whoa
[00:37:54.300 --> 00:37:59.820]   Hey, um, was there an ll cool j1 that i know he was in that one with the dots of dash as he was in the very
[00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:03.820]   That was ll cool j and in fact i was i'm glad you said it because i thought i was like man
[00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:08.620]   That guy looks like ll cool j yeah, yeah, it was him but basically if you don't want to go back to it
[00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:13.020]   He was talking about okay. Yeah, you have to kind of hear it in his voice. It's all right all right
[00:38:13.020 --> 00:38:16.140]   So that's the that's the gmail tap one right the morse code one
[00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:22.140]   It'll jump all the way to like 20% left i think wow i can't believe that they got ll cool j
[00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:27.980]   Maybe he was at the google google campus and uh, come on who couldn't get ll cool j now i can get him for
[00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:34.860]   Yeah, i agree does everything is that him yeah, it's great
[00:38:34.860 --> 00:38:41.340]   Wait a minute that's hysterical that's ll cool. Yeah, you have the coolest tat Smith
[00:38:41.340 --> 00:38:47.900]   That is his real name that is his real name your mouth can only slow enough you guys know a lot about
[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:53.020]   This little what he says i'm really i'm excited to see where who's this i think
[00:38:53.020 --> 00:38:56.940]   The piece is probably the biggest highest production right here with that fingers
[00:38:57.420 --> 00:39:01.740]   No, i think the one with the negative people can be able to write emails anytime they want
[00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:07.820]   I could tap it in the morning. You can tap it at night. You can tap it in the bathroom
[00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:13.020]   That gives that whole sentence a new meaning that gives i
[00:39:13.020 --> 00:39:18.860]   Now that i know it's cool j i go like oh, of course you get out of course
[00:39:18.860 --> 00:39:23.260]   You could tap it in the morning you could tap it when i you could tap it in the bathroom
[00:39:25.100 --> 00:39:27.900]   Did you get this one off i did not get that one
[00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:31.420]   Oh, think keke now think you got a bunch of stuff
[00:39:31.420 --> 00:39:35.020]   And of course half these will end up being real products in about 25 minutes
[00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:43.100]   Now brian, what do you think the twitter uh not the twitter one that the well the one about twitter and the toilet paper
[00:39:43.100 --> 00:39:48.460]   I won't say the name. Oh, that's real. That's totally real. Why is that not a prank that should what happens?
[00:39:48.460 --> 00:39:51.580]   Is that a real thing uh, well dude, it's like they made you novelty
[00:39:54.060 --> 00:39:59.180]   I'm gonna start saying fellow. He's like your old life friends like yeah, you think would you just start saying chaps
[00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:02.860]   And he'll say dude in the movie great. I tell you gents
[00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:07.420]   Uh, no, I think there's always been a place for novelty stuff
[00:40:07.420 --> 00:40:11.660]   They got like novelty constitutions wipe your ass with a constitution. They got all that stuff
[00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:15.340]   So this is real. What is it novelty what it's toilet paper with tweets on it?
[00:40:15.340 --> 00:40:18.380]   Oh tweet your butt with nothing. That's probably good idea. That's
[00:40:18.380 --> 00:40:22.540]   Now so they they told me to search for tip. Oh
[00:40:23.500 --> 00:40:28.620]   Put tweets where the sun don't shine and there's a new name for twitter. I'll let you figure out what it is
[00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:33.500]   Okay, now somebody said search for taylor swift on the google marketplace
[00:40:33.500 --> 00:40:37.180]   And I get exactly what I'd expect. Is there an april fools joke there?
[00:40:37.180 --> 00:40:43.580]   Taylor swift just her music just her music. Okay. I'm just kidding. I like no. I like Taylor
[00:40:43.580 --> 00:40:46.220]   I think you have to search in the google play store to get
[00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:52.460]   What this person was talking on your phone? Oh on the phone. Okay. What what is it? Can you describe it?
[00:40:53.260 --> 00:40:56.780]   Uh, basically it says, um, are you looking for Beyonce or
[00:40:56.780 --> 00:41:01.740]   That's kind of mean
[00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:11.500]   Of course playing off of Kanye West's, you know, daily swifts getting her award and he comes up and says
[00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:13.420]   I mean, I just don't I don't want to interrupt you, but
[00:41:13.420 --> 00:41:16.140]   Beyonce's got the best video of the year
[00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:17.340]   Uh
[00:41:17.340 --> 00:41:24.780]   As a plug a genus. Uh, was it a new? What is it? I never can remember a new something new domain.net. Dot net
[00:41:24.780 --> 00:41:29.260]   What is she? What is she doing? She hasn't apparently collected all these gags. You know, afro
[00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:34.300]   This is true actually apple was founded on april first. It became it was incorporated in april first 1976
[00:41:34.300 --> 00:41:37.740]   And that is not a joke. Do they ever do any jokes apple?
[00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:41.820]   They too stuffy now. They take the newt way too serious the new
[00:41:43.580 --> 00:41:49.660]   Hey, oh, great. This prank of all time. Yeah, this is just a big infographic about april fools. I don't know
[00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:53.100]   What else is there? I don't know
[00:41:53.100 --> 00:41:59.100]   Uh, I think we've I think we've mined this like we got it. Yeah, we actually have tech news
[00:41:59.100 --> 00:42:06.540]   That's right. Is there anything to go? We talked about richard branson and virgin volcanic, right? No, we didn't I missed this one
[00:42:06.540 --> 00:42:09.980]   I haven't seen that one either. So branson says, uh, you know
[00:42:09.980 --> 00:42:12.140]   there
[00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:14.140]   Only 500 people have been to space
[00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:17.420]   Only three people have been to the bottom of the ocean, but no one
[00:42:17.420 --> 00:42:22.060]   Has ever attempted to journey to the core of an active volcano until now
[00:42:22.060 --> 00:42:29.260]   And it's a little drill. Yeah, you can cut your time going to hawai and i think it's like just a couple hours and we'll be there
[00:42:29.260 --> 00:42:34.860]   Yep, this is okay. I did like the people who took april first as an opportunity to make certain statements
[00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:39.100]   You know that uh notch over at minecraft is uh his next game is going to be called scroll
[00:42:39.180 --> 00:42:41.980]   I believe and uh the folks over at bethesta
[00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:44.940]   Uh who apparently like the programmers are fans of minecraft
[00:42:44.940 --> 00:42:49.900]   But the legal team is like no they'll confuse it with elder scrolls and he was like look i'll put a subtitle will distinguish it
[00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:52.140]   It'll be totally different and they're like no no no
[00:42:52.140 --> 00:42:57.340]   Seasoned assist and then uh it's so on mars or on today april first
[00:42:57.340 --> 00:43:00.540]   He releases the name of his new game is going to be mars effect
[00:43:00.540 --> 00:43:06.780]   Looking exactly like massive and then it goes on and it's the whole thing is digging on on the whole controversy wow
[00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:11.260]   Wow, so but yeah, I saw that and I didn't get it. Yeah now. I understand. Thank goodness
[00:43:11.260 --> 00:43:15.100]   Thank you young people are here to explain it to us old dudes
[00:43:15.100 --> 00:43:21.660]   Um, we actually adjust in beiber. I don't know if that was uh for april fools, but he actually
[00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:26.140]   As a prank tweeted call me and put out a phone number
[00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:32.940]   Yeah, you know leo i am you know expert all things bebbers i can take the story would you take would you take the beiber?
[00:43:32.940 --> 00:43:33.980]   Yeah
[00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:38.860]   Yeah, so yeah, so basically he put a phone number out there. He didn't give the last digit and
[00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:41.100]   Was it his phone number?
[00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:43.740]   Yeah, I guess he was saying it was his phone number and what happened is
[00:43:43.740 --> 00:43:46.540]   Thousands of girls start calling this
[00:43:46.540 --> 00:43:52.220]   There's this couple there's only nine other possible. There's you know, it's one digit missing either make 10 calls you're in
[00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:58.140]   Yeah, so so so now they're upset. They want to sue and i say no i think they overreacted with this
[00:43:58.140 --> 00:44:03.260]   I think this would have been a perfect opportunity for this elderly couple to to you know
[00:44:03.580 --> 00:44:07.260]   Find try to find out who will be the best girlfriend for their grandkids, you know
[00:44:07.260 --> 00:44:13.260]   They could have really just kind of narrowed the field there they had all these girls who are loyal who
[00:44:13.260 --> 00:44:18.540]   Who loved you know guys, so that was it would have been great. I think they overreacted on this
[00:44:18.540 --> 00:44:23.500]   I understand why they're upset, but then I read what their lawyer is suggesting for compensation
[00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:26.540]   What is he suggesting and it's just a little ridiculous. Yeah, they either
[00:44:26.540 --> 00:44:32.060]   Suggestions from the their legal team have included tickets for the couple's grandchildren to a beiber concert
[00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:37.900]   That's good an apology from tamer billion dollars an apology from beiber and
[00:44:37.900 --> 00:44:42.140]   And an endorsement for an online project created by
[00:44:42.140 --> 00:44:48.460]   But you don't wonder about the other eight people who probably also got a lot of car
[00:44:48.460 --> 00:44:51.740]   He's got 19 million followers when it caused him to throw some tickets their way
[00:44:51.740 --> 00:44:55.420]   They should give him at least that should settle everything with an arm wrestling contest
[00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:58.460]   So this is not a joke, but it almost feels like a joke
[00:44:59.100 --> 00:45:03.900]   Apple has decided to cut over time at fox con after a lot of criticism
[00:45:03.900 --> 00:45:09.580]   Uh, they don't own fox con but no, but they've asked fox con fox con decided to do it
[00:45:09.580 --> 00:45:13.580]   I bet you apple actually I shouldn't give credit to apple fox con decided to
[00:45:13.580 --> 00:45:18.620]   Cut down the amount of overtime. They're requiring of their workers the workers are pissed
[00:45:18.620 --> 00:45:23.100]   Yeah, well if you uh when this oh that's funny Reuters
[00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:28.460]   They said that they there were two concerns that the that the employees had one was that they wanted more hours
[00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:31.820]   And that they didn't like the food of the cafeteria. Those are the two biggest concerns
[00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:34.780]   And so they respond like oh you want more hours. How about less? Yeah
[00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:41.820]   Chen yamai who was a fox con worker for hoonan said we're here to work not to play our incomes very important
[00:45:41.820 --> 00:45:45.500]   We've just been told we can only work 36 hours a month
[00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:49.340]   A month a month a maximum of 36 hours a month of overtime
[00:45:49.340 --> 00:45:52.220]   I tell you a lot of us aren't happy with this
[00:45:52.220 --> 00:45:56.380]   We think 60 hours of overtime a month would be reasonable and that 36 is too little
[00:45:56.540 --> 00:46:01.820]   Well, and in fact uh apple's policy says that we don't want to see overtime greater than 60 hours
[00:46:01.820 --> 00:46:07.660]   But the chinese law itself limits it to only 49 and I don't know how seriously anyone takes the chinese law
[00:46:07.660 --> 00:46:14.220]   Or if they should I think I think there's a danger here that we're you know, we're trying to apply
[00:46:14.220 --> 00:46:19.900]   Exactly. Western values to an eastern culture and here you're saying the workers
[00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:25.420]   And I'm not saying they should be overworked. Of course. I'm not saying that but they're saying that we we want this
[00:46:25.420 --> 00:46:28.060]   You know, that's part of their their culture to be
[00:46:28.060 --> 00:46:35.100]   Uh hard working like this so they're they're rightfully upset, you know, it's kind of kind of goes back to that whole kony situation
[00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:38.940]   You know, we're here. We're in the western world judging what's going on over there
[00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:42.140]   And they're sitting there in our country. It's like wait a minute. What are you all talking about?
[00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:46.220]   This guy's been gone for years, you know, handle your own business. So
[00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:50.380]   I think that's a problem that we you know, we we are meddling get over that
[00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:55.260]   Yeah, and keep in mind also like a lot of the employees over the fox con they're traveling from very small villages
[00:46:55.260 --> 00:47:00.860]   Traveling far away from their families to do this so they can have an opportunity to work really hard for a specific amount of time
[00:47:00.860 --> 00:47:04.380]   Pull down a bunch of they send money to the family right well and and it really is
[00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:08.060]   It's like we've got this vision of it like oh, I want them to live life like I have a life
[00:47:08.060 --> 00:47:12.380]   So I don't have to feel guilty when I buy my new iPad and I think it's I think it is very well intentioned
[00:47:12.380 --> 00:47:17.020]   But as most of these initiatives do they're gonna have terrible unintended consequences
[00:47:17.020 --> 00:47:20.780]   Well, I don't think we should back off on wanting appropriate conditions there. Well, yeah
[00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:24.140]   Yeah, you had the thing with a child labor and people being whipped
[00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:27.180]   You know whipped well, I'm just saying I hope not well
[00:47:27.180 --> 00:47:29.660]   You know if you want to look at the
[00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:34.540]   Situation that's that's really bad. We have to look at our own country in this and the essential slave labor
[00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:38.300]   We have more prisoners per capita than any other nation in the world
[00:47:38.300 --> 00:47:44.940]   We have more prisoners in total than any other nation in the world and we paid them a 23 cents an hour to do just about everything right
[00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:49.900]   Yeah, no, it's terrible and that's in fact one of the things people complain about in china is this so-called
[00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:54.620]   prisoner labor the slave labor we have more slave labor than anyone right and
[00:47:54.620 --> 00:48:02.300]   And why and I guess maybe this has been asked before but why is apple being targeted where there's hp samsung amazon?
[00:48:02.300 --> 00:48:08.860]   Nokia nintendo sony marzo. I think that's unfair as well. I agree all these other they use fox con as well
[00:48:08.860 --> 00:48:11.980]   So like I'm maybe that's just a rhetorical question
[00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:16.700]   But it just saves a little weird that they're being targeted maybe because they make the most money well
[00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:23.020]   Nevertheless, well, yeah, because they're earthy crunchy their apple there there's higher standard whatever but nevertheless
[00:48:23.020 --> 00:48:26.860]   I don't think we should back off on looking at these conditions, but you're absolutely right
[00:48:26.860 --> 00:48:30.380]   It's more complicated than just well, you know, we're gonna pay them more
[00:48:30.380 --> 00:48:35.580]   Uh, and and maybe you know, there's an unintended consequence of cutting their hours. That's not what they're there for
[00:48:35.580 --> 00:48:39.260]   Tim cook for the was the first apple ceo to visit fox connie's
[00:48:39.260 --> 00:48:44.060]   Showing here smiling next to smiling happy employees. They're all laughing
[00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:48.940]   I like they gave them they gave him a yellow slicker the best people and then put a guy in yellow
[00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:51.420]   So everyone knows after the guy in yellow comes yeah, right?
[00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:59.260]   All they gave was photographs basically
[00:48:59.260 --> 00:49:01.420]   Um, that's it
[00:49:01.420 --> 00:49:07.820]   He went to the fox con plant trip to beijing where he meant top leaders including the mayor the vice prime minister
[00:49:07.820 --> 00:49:12.620]   I mean, do you really think that they're gonna limit to only 39 hours of overtime?
[00:49:12.620 --> 00:49:18.940]   You don't think that we're instantly gonna create a black market for overtime where it's billed under someone else's name and there's fictitious people get created
[00:49:18.940 --> 00:49:21.340]   All right. Yeah
[00:49:21.340 --> 00:49:22.140]   By the way
[00:49:22.140 --> 00:49:25.820]   One last tim cook story and then we'll talk about hacking scarlet joe hanson
[00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:28.380]   Oh, uh, sat with her calling it now, dude
[00:49:28.380 --> 00:49:31.500]   You could tap it anywhere
[00:49:31.500 --> 00:49:33.340]   You could tap in the bathroom
[00:49:33.340 --> 00:49:37.660]   apple workers put tim cook atop the list of most beloved ceos
[00:49:38.540 --> 00:49:44.140]   You just got in I know but he has the love and don't even know leave a guy. He has a fire
[00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:48.860]   Rating two points better than steve jobs got in his last year as ceo
[00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:53.500]   He has a 97 approval rating april fools. No, no
[00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:58.220]   See I know and that's why don't like april fools because he can't be sure but no this came out march 30
[00:49:58.220 --> 00:50:02.940]   You know what this is this is the exact same situation we have with the president of the united states when everything's great and the economy is good
[00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:07.740]   We think the president must be awesome and we give him high approval ratings and when they're bad then we blame the president
[00:50:07.740 --> 00:50:13.580]   When in fact, uh president has very little to do with the economy and likewise the ceo has very little to do with the specific
[00:50:13.580 --> 00:50:19.500]   Heep, you know the very specific direction of the show. I mean this is they're rich. They're happy
[00:50:19.500 --> 00:50:25.820]   They're sitting on gajillions of dollars. So of course they're happy with the ceo number two the ceo of ernsten young which is a
[00:50:25.820 --> 00:50:33.180]   Yeah, I that's my man. I've always early you love him never heard of love him. He is such an icon, isn't he?
[00:50:33.180 --> 00:50:34.700]   um
[00:50:34.700 --> 00:50:39.340]   Qualcomm ceo paul jacobs american express make this up. I do I do I do I
[00:50:39.340 --> 00:50:44.540]   Bide lecture about how these things are picked. No, no, this is uh, there's a survey
[00:50:44.540 --> 00:50:52.060]   Of employees. These are the people who work at apple or ask this. Well, this is idiotic then it doesn't make any sense google
[00:50:52.060 --> 00:50:56.380]   Intel Accenture vmware starbucks right at the top 10
[00:50:56.380 --> 00:51:01.900]   Did you know the ceo of north strom is named normstrom? What are the chances of that seems odd
[00:51:03.180 --> 00:51:05.420]   Maybe maybe you're required to change your name
[00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:09.740]   I don't know. That's just I think that's kind of interesting
[00:51:09.740 --> 00:51:16.620]   Are you on the list? I am way off that list. I am not I I don't know. Where would you put me? I lean?

[00:57:11.820 --> 00:57:16.300]   That means he loves his audience so much that he says something twice to each and every one of them
[00:57:16.300 --> 00:57:22.220]   I I was I got a tweet nasty tweet from a guy and I always check with somebody really says nasty things

[00:58:09.820 --> 00:58:13.100]   All right
[00:58:13.100 --> 00:58:17.500]   This is this by the way this is probably
[00:58:17.500 --> 00:58:24.940]   I'm guessing this is link bay hacking scarlet joe hansen and 50 other celebs using google and
[00:58:25.340 --> 00:58:30.380]   Gumption this is about a 34 year old jaxonville florida resident christopher chaney
[00:58:30.380 --> 00:58:36.780]   Who had the email address for celebrity stylist and handbag designer simona ruch
[00:58:36.780 --> 00:58:39.500]   didn't have the password
[00:58:39.500 --> 00:58:42.780]   So he just used the password reset feature on apples
[00:58:42.780 --> 00:58:47.900]   cloud servers it's me.com answered the required required security
[00:58:47.900 --> 00:58:53.020]   Questions by supplying publicly available information little little tip here
[00:58:53.820 --> 00:58:58.860]   If you're a public figure or you have a wiki pedia page and they say, you know, what's your dog's name?
[00:58:58.860 --> 00:59:01.820]   Where were you born? Where were you born? Don't use that
[00:59:01.820 --> 00:59:07.420]   So when you ask when I use questions like they say what uh, you know, what is your mother's main name?
[00:59:07.420 --> 00:59:10.380]   I say banana slug there you go and then that way
[00:59:10.380 --> 00:59:12.860]   hyping it in now
[00:59:12.860 --> 00:59:16.060]   Of course you did just announce that this week attack
[00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:19.180]   Anyway, it worked right
[00:59:19.180 --> 00:59:21.180]   So he got her email
[00:59:21.980 --> 00:59:23.980]   So uh from there
[00:59:23.980 --> 00:59:27.820]   He got all her email and had it sent to his account
[00:59:27.820 --> 00:59:32.140]   He mirrored it. It was just like that that's so creepy, but yeah, he mirrors
[00:59:32.140 --> 00:59:36.140]   Well, that's what I would do email. Yeah, that's because that's why you don't have to ever you don't have to log in again
[00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:40.220]   You just change the settings once you're gonna get all the mail and the person never knows it right
[00:59:40.220 --> 00:59:42.460]   Unless they check their settings
[00:59:42.460 --> 00:59:46.300]   Exactly and so if you do get hacked and by the way this happens all the time check your settings
[00:59:46.300 --> 00:59:48.620]   Obviously, make sure your mail is not getting sent somewhere else
[00:59:49.180 --> 00:59:53.500]   That you don't know about nice about gmail. They'll let you know gmail will actually tell you they do yeah
[00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:56.940]   IP address. Yeah, it was logged in. Yeah, it's really cool. Yeah
[00:59:56.940 --> 01:00:03.020]   Um the amazing thing is he went on this spree in person ending all these people resetting all these passwords
[01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:08.540]   And about like half a year into it. He thinks oh, hey, maybe I should use a vpm to hide my IP address
[01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:13.820]   But but he was like as this hand as this designer lady
[01:00:13.820 --> 01:00:18.620]   He was he was texting or sending email messages to like christina agulera saying like hey, I'm sorry
[01:00:18.780 --> 01:00:23.100]   I just really need some scampi clothing photos and it worked to send it over if you could
[01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:31.100]   And then without question like sure he requested pictures of agulera wearing as he would later admit to a federal judge quote very little clothing
[01:00:31.100 --> 01:00:34.300]   Apparently she complied
[01:00:34.300 --> 01:00:42.060]   That's a puzzle that's what puzzles me your hairdresser says hey, can you send me some naked pictures
[01:00:43.820 --> 01:00:48.380]   Then he went on to mila kunis scarlet joe hansen got that in for you. Yep
[01:00:48.380 --> 01:00:51.100]   What is the character that she's going to be in this new
[01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:56.540]   Fantastic for whatever. I know. Oh wait. Oh wait. You're talking about the avengers. She's the black window
[01:00:56.540 --> 01:01:03.420]   I don't know the rubber and fenci man with plastic man and fighting rock guy
[01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:06.860]   And the green guy gets angry
[01:01:06.860 --> 01:01:13.660]   Green angry man mr. Frowny face mr. Frowny. She's black widow. Huh? Yeah. Yeah black widow. Hmm
[01:01:13.820 --> 01:01:16.940]   She was in the last hour. Yeah, she was in the hour. She was in the hour. She was in the hour. She obtained
[01:01:16.940 --> 01:01:24.700]   Okay, so he went on so in january of last year. He celebrated the new year by logging into your hansen's email account on yahoo
[01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:27.340]   So he got her account now
[01:01:27.340 --> 01:01:33.660]   And uh send a message to a friend asking the friend to please send back copies of private pictures. Yeah
[01:01:33.660 --> 01:01:36.700]   She is a horn dog
[01:01:36.700 --> 01:01:37.900]   embarrassing
[01:01:37.900 --> 01:01:39.740]   some berry obtained
[01:01:39.740 --> 01:01:41.900]   several photos of jhansen and
[01:01:42.540 --> 01:01:44.620]   You you probably seen the pictures. I know I have
[01:01:44.620 --> 01:01:47.180]   Hey
[01:01:47.180 --> 01:01:48.380]   Hey, oh
[01:01:48.380 --> 01:01:49.340]   Hey, oh
[01:01:49.340 --> 01:01:53.580]   Uh, she confessed she had taken themself with her smartphone. These are old from three years ago
[01:01:53.580 --> 01:01:57.340]   They were sent to my husband or ex-husband ryan rennels. There's nothing wrong with that
[01:01:57.340 --> 01:02:00.140]   Of course, there's not
[01:02:00.140 --> 01:02:03.180]   What's wrong is what this guy did right?
[01:02:03.180 --> 01:02:08.780]   Yeah, I guess the lesson here is is for all the reputation that hackers have of being high tech people
[01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:10.780]   It's really the lowest tech
[01:02:10.780 --> 01:02:14.380]   Is raised you know having the gonads to go for this it's just because the guy did it
[01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:16.780]   He wasn't using any sophisticated tool at all
[01:02:16.780 --> 01:02:21.900]   Not of course in fact he just started using hide my ip like a few months before he got caught. Yeah
[01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:27.260]   Uh, but they like this is the same technique that they were able to get Sarah pailons email address
[01:02:27.260 --> 01:02:29.660]   I mean, I think the two lessons are number one. I think you nailed it
[01:02:29.660 --> 01:02:33.420]   Don't use the actual information make it something secret that only you know, but number two
[01:02:33.420 --> 01:02:36.860]   It's like if you do want a hack. It's uh, don't bother getting high tech with it. Just
[01:02:37.420 --> 01:02:40.380]   And it doesn't hurt to ask for naked pictures. I guess
[01:02:40.380 --> 01:02:45.820]   You can't you can't know if you don't try. Wow. That is just a wild story very good article
[01:02:45.820 --> 01:02:51.900]   If you want to read more about how all this happened nad Anderson writing the law and disorder column in the arse tech
[01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:54.140]   Uh
[01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:56.780]   He apologized that makes you feel better
[01:02:56.780 --> 01:03:01.500]   Uh speaking of which did you the master card? Uh visa breach?
[01:03:01.500 --> 01:03:06.060]   I don't know how about the breach that paul allen's card you dead was a hot story
[01:03:06.140 --> 01:03:08.140]   All right, we can talk about that too. Uh
[01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:12.380]   I just mentioned somebody in the chat room trucky wanted to talk about
[01:03:12.380 --> 01:03:18.060]   Yeah, but the story leo's talking about uh visa master card just sent out an alert like uh bt dubs
[01:03:18.060 --> 01:03:20.380]   10 million cards might have gotten stolen
[01:03:20.380 --> 01:03:27.900]   Million cards using a processor called global payments which processes for both visa and master card
[01:03:27.900 --> 01:03:35.420]   Am I the only one who's utterly unconcerned by this because you realize every credit card part of the agreement is that your total liability
[01:03:35.820 --> 01:03:41.100]   Is $50 and I think they even got rid of that. There's there's you have no responsibility if somebody steals your card
[01:03:41.100 --> 01:03:45.340]   Your only obligation why you should be doing anyway is keep pay attention. No, no
[01:03:45.340 --> 01:03:48.380]   What charges this is a wrong attitude in your part. What?
[01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:51.020]   I'll tell you why is because dude
[01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:56.140]   The caps because by being so kind of casual the way you are
[01:03:56.140 --> 01:04:04.380]   It encourages more thievery and it only do is jack up the prices the rates that you pay for your card to pay for the criminals
[01:04:04.620 --> 01:04:10.860]   That rip everybody else what you're paying more money over time because your your lax attitude
[01:04:10.860 --> 01:04:12.380]   No, I don't have a lax attitude
[01:04:12.380 --> 01:04:16.300]   I check this statement every single month, which is what everyone should do and if there's ever in a row
[01:04:16.300 --> 01:04:18.140]   Yeah, but you said you don't care you see you
[01:04:18.140 --> 01:04:21.020]   I don't care about the story about 10 million who does get damaged
[01:04:21.020 --> 01:04:24.780]   Is it the purchase is gonna cost you money merchant? It might not be you it might be the no
[01:04:24.780 --> 01:04:27.020]   No, no, they pass everything under the end user
[01:04:27.020 --> 01:04:29.900]   They don't have merchants don't get that kind of a hassle
[01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:33.740]   You're paying it's coming out of your pocket these guys
[01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:37.340]   You know what the other thing that comes out of you is that
[01:04:37.340 --> 01:04:41.260]   What is what is the other thing that comes out of you?
[01:04:41.260 --> 01:04:43.420]   No
[01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:47.020]   Hey, yo, well, it depends if you tap it in the bathroom
[01:04:47.020 --> 01:04:52.300]   What comes out of you is not good is that and I found this to be the case
[01:04:52.300 --> 01:04:55.820]   I can hardly use my credit card anymore because oh, I'll give you an example
[01:04:55.820 --> 01:05:00.860]   Like that's good
[01:05:00.860 --> 01:05:02.220]   Scares he jumps
[01:05:02.220 --> 01:05:06.300]   I'll give you an example. I bought something so okay zappos okay not hacked
[01:05:06.300 --> 01:05:08.940]   My credit my
[01:05:08.940 --> 01:05:11.500]   Everybody in zappos count they had to reset their passwords
[01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:14.620]   They never could reset it so I said all right. Well screw it. I'm going to shoes.com
[01:05:14.620 --> 01:05:17.180]   I ordered something first time ordered. I ordered two pairs of sneakers
[01:05:17.180 --> 01:05:19.980]   That's a mistake
[01:05:19.980 --> 01:05:23.500]   Why because they could be used to make meth two of the same pairs of sneakers. Oh, yeah
[01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:25.340]   Yeah, you get three go well
[01:05:25.340 --> 01:05:30.060]   We talked about the order we talked about this before when I because I had it gone to uh
[01:05:31.020 --> 01:05:35.020]   Some sort of a conference where the at the time the CEO of American Express discuss
[01:05:35.020 --> 01:05:39.500]   Discuss some of the security measures and you can test this yourself because people have done it
[01:05:39.500 --> 01:05:41.260]   I'm sure it still works
[01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:45.420]   If you get your card your card and you go get two tanks of gas
[01:05:45.420 --> 01:05:49.820]   Yeah in the same day. Yeah in the same day and then you go buy sneakers sneakers
[01:05:49.820 --> 01:05:52.220]   Your card will be canceled in the spot
[01:05:52.220 --> 01:05:56.700]   Yeah, and that's what happened because the guy says that what happens is the guy steals a card
[01:05:56.780 --> 01:06:01.740]   The first thing he does is he gets a tank of gas and then he brings his buddy over for a tank of gas in his car
[01:06:01.740 --> 01:06:05.180]   So he can be a big shot unusual behavior nobody would buy two tanks at same time
[01:06:05.180 --> 01:06:06.060]   unusual
[01:06:06.060 --> 01:06:09.180]   And so then he goes and he starts buying clothes, you know
[01:06:09.180 --> 01:06:10.780]   What was that one more?
[01:06:10.780 --> 01:06:16.060]   No, I'll say john what if this was a taxi driver who had an affinity for Nike shoes
[01:06:16.060 --> 01:06:18.620]   But that's well, that's the point. I was completely normal
[01:06:18.620 --> 01:06:22.540]   I bought two pairs of sneakers because I want one pair for home and one pair for the jam
[01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:24.940]   He has to refill his tank every couple hours. I didn't do that
[01:06:25.740 --> 01:06:29.340]   And the other thing I did was I was having shipped to a different address now
[01:06:29.340 --> 01:06:32.780]   So but this was I'm having shipped to work not not home
[01:06:32.780 --> 01:06:36.300]   Okay, I gave them the credit usually like on amazon when they do that they say okay
[01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:39.580]   But you're gonna have to give us the credit card information again to verify this really is your credit card
[01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:41.100]   And then they go ahead and do that
[01:06:41.100 --> 01:06:43.660]   But because I guess it was the first time I'd order from shoes.com
[01:06:43.660 --> 01:06:48.540]   And they did try to call me but the number the phone number is some I don't know where you don't answer your phone or email
[01:06:48.540 --> 01:06:53.660]   I don't answer my phone. But this this isn't even a credit card thing. This is just a shoes.com thing now. They canceled the or no
[01:06:54.540 --> 01:07:00.220]   Well, you don't know when wasn't the credit card kicking it back. Same. This is could be not authorized
[01:07:00.220 --> 01:07:01.500]   But that's that's my point
[01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:06.300]   And so that's what that's the other side effect of this kind of thing is it gets harder and harder to use a credit card
[01:07:06.300 --> 01:07:11.660]   We can't use our corporate card hardly at all because we get dinged all the time the constant call saying or did you really buy this?
[01:07:11.660 --> 01:07:16.780]   Yes, I really bought once they see a pattern of behavior then that goes away. Apparently buying anything is the pattern
[01:07:16.780 --> 01:07:21.180]   They don't so so let me ask you do you think that
[01:07:22.220 --> 01:07:25.500]   Payment by phone or fingerprint would be the thing
[01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:31.100]   Because look at least with the credit card if you if they say you owe money and you dispute it
[01:07:31.100 --> 01:07:32.460]   You're like no, I don't know that they say yes
[01:07:32.460 --> 01:07:36.380]   We do think you owe that then you can just you know sit there cross your arms and then take it to court
[01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:40.780]   But when you tie your phone to it and all of a sudden apples the ones say no you owe it and I'm like no
[01:07:40.780 --> 01:07:42.620]   I don't they're like guess what you don't have a phone number anymore
[01:07:42.620 --> 01:07:45.740]   No, that's the big danger of even the electronic wallets
[01:07:45.740 --> 01:07:50.700]   No, I think I think all of these phone companies out of it paying by phone is a terrible terrible idea
[01:07:50.700 --> 01:07:53.180]   I do I do like the idea of one time use credit cards
[01:07:53.180 --> 01:07:57.580]   And I think that that's something that the credit card companies don't like so much. It's a lot of work on their part
[01:07:57.580 --> 01:08:02.460]   Well, it's a you can if we buy online you can in some credit cards will do this
[01:08:02.460 --> 01:08:06.140]   Say i'm going to use this number once you can only use one charge on it or
[01:08:06.140 --> 01:08:08.620]   I'm going to use this credit card only for this merchant
[01:08:08.620 --> 01:08:14.540]   This this is now tied to amazon and no other merchant can use it and those kinds of things will have a lot of security
[01:08:14.540 --> 01:08:16.540]   But of course it makes it much more complicated for credit
[01:08:16.540 --> 01:08:19.420]   The fees of those not complicated is all done by computers
[01:08:20.140 --> 01:08:22.140]   computers located can it be really
[01:08:22.140 --> 01:08:25.420]   Hey, do you feel sorry for rim?
[01:08:25.420 --> 01:08:31.420]   Sure, I do I feel bad. I liked I I had a little blackberry page. Oh, I got some good stuff to say about this one
[01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:37.260]   All right, take it. So rim has a new ceo. They fired those guys the clowns
[01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:42.300]   Three stujas three the two stujas two stujas and the new ceo
[01:08:42.300 --> 01:08:50.060]   Uh, well rim sales fell sharply last quarter first revenue decline in seven years subscriber growth
[01:08:50.300 --> 01:08:52.300]   rate all time low of
[01:08:52.300 --> 01:08:55.500]   3% the two ceo stepped down
[01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:58.700]   Morale is flagging
[01:08:58.700 --> 01:09:01.580]   According to executives inside and outside the company
[01:09:01.580 --> 01:09:07.100]   At the dinner meeting in february between rim's chief technology officer
[01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:13.660]   Uh, one of the executives who left thursday and chief information officers from companies and government agencies the mood was somber
[01:09:13.660 --> 01:09:17.180]   Is like going to awake said one person there?
[01:09:18.060 --> 01:09:23.580]   Um, the so there's a lot of pressure on thorsten hines was the new ceo
[01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:28.700]   Uh to turn this around they've got the blackberry tan the new operating systems coming
[01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:33.260]   Uh, they're going to roll out new blackberry smartphones later this year
[01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:41.580]   But they are also conducting. What does this mean john? What does this corporate speak mean a comprehensive review of strategic opportunities
[01:09:41.580 --> 01:09:46.940]   It means that they don't know what the hell they're trying to find a buyer is what they're going to throw at it
[01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:51.500]   Is what that means. So what do you think le mari? Are you do you ever use a blackberry?
[01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:56.700]   I have never as close as I got to it was a palm trail, which you know, yeah, it's the same thing
[01:09:56.700 --> 01:10:02.940]   Um, but but yeah, I think rim really needs to I know they denied it a couple days ago
[01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:08.220]   They need to really consider where the they need to keep this consumer business because I was reading about
[01:10:08.220 --> 01:10:13.420]   I think my elk and uh told me about this book the 22 mutable laws of marketing. Oh my god
[01:10:13.420 --> 01:10:17.100]   That is the best book in the world. The only thing that's better is their origin of brands
[01:10:17.100 --> 01:10:20.620]   Which is even better but it comes out of the same material. I will read that allen loraries
[01:10:20.620 --> 01:10:24.220]   I bought you the origin of brands the very first time I have it
[01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:27.580]   I gave that to you that book is an awesome book. Yeah
[01:10:27.580 --> 01:10:30.220]   Oh, are you you were saying?
[01:10:30.220 --> 01:10:37.100]   So so what that book was talking about was um the problems that companies like pepsi or coke had with line extension
[01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:41.580]   They tried to do too much clear pepsi and all these different flavors when he should have just stuck to
[01:10:41.980 --> 01:10:46.460]   Something simple and I think that's what rim tried to be all things to all people
[01:10:46.460 --> 01:10:51.260]   And when you do that like sam's song is doing now when they're you know, they're pushing out 15 different
[01:10:51.260 --> 01:10:55.820]   Tablets instead of focusing on one or two and you know, just trying to see which one sticks
[01:10:55.820 --> 01:10:59.260]   You know, you dilute your market. So I think it's really important for
[01:10:59.260 --> 01:11:03.420]   Rem is you know doing ibm or do what hp was going to do
[01:11:03.420 --> 01:11:11.340]   Um, you know last year and say hey, maybe we just focus on what we do best corporate focus on that forget about the consumer market let apple
[01:11:11.820 --> 01:11:15.500]   Uh google have it to some extent microsoft. I would even focus
[01:11:15.500 --> 01:11:21.580]   I would even take that a step farther and I say that they could probably win if they focus on one aspect of corporate and say security
[01:11:21.580 --> 01:11:24.780]   If they could paint themselves as the only secure solution
[01:11:24.780 --> 01:11:29.340]   It's a little hard now because they've given the keys to the kingdom to india
[01:11:29.340 --> 01:11:34.780]   They've given who else asked for Saudi Arabia Saudi Arabia. It's a little hard for them to say where we're secure
[01:11:34.780 --> 01:11:38.220]   It all goes through canada. I don't know if that makes people reassured
[01:11:38.860 --> 01:11:44.860]   Or not, but I have a I agree with you that was their selling point for a long time, especially in enterprise
[01:11:44.860 --> 01:11:50.060]   Hey, we're secure. We have a secure server pepsi blue is one of these things every member pepsi blue
[01:11:50.060 --> 01:11:53.820]   Yeah, I think for a rule why I think they actually tested a pepsi blue
[01:11:53.820 --> 01:11:59.020]   Clear you go to the grocery outlet and you can see all these crazy tests. Yeah stuff that they never yeah
[01:11:59.020 --> 01:12:01.260]   It never gets under the market and the cans are dented
[01:12:01.260 --> 01:12:06.300]   No, they're dead those days are over a hundred twenty five really cans no longer dent
[01:12:06.860 --> 01:12:10.460]   No, the day the dent it used to start off as they used to be the cat food warehouse
[01:12:10.460 --> 01:12:17.580]   Dented cans and then they kind of got it to a new gig. You know who I talked to today ron rosberg the owner of repo depot
[01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:19.100]   Oh
[01:12:19.100 --> 01:12:24.860]   He says it's for sale. Anybody wants to buy it. Wow repo depot calm. He'd be glad to sell it to you cheap
[01:12:24.860 --> 01:12:34.220]   Yes, he's so yeah, so so with rim. I say, you know love or hate apple one thing they get right is doing few things the right way
[01:12:34.300 --> 01:12:40.620]   So, you know, they don't throw multiple products. So rim forget about the consumers. It's not gonna happen
[01:12:40.620 --> 01:12:44.620]   We're not gonna buy them. It's just I mean the market is very book dead in the wall
[01:12:44.620 --> 01:12:49.500]   It lost 125 million dollars in their quarter now the revenue is good 4.2 billion
[01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:53.180]   That's a decent amount of revenue. They've got to figure out a way to make it profitable
[01:12:53.180 --> 01:12:59.580]   I think you're right. I think it's tough to sell the consumers fall in you in a world where it's android and iphone and nothing else
[01:12:59.660 --> 01:13:04.380]   It's hard to sell even even microsoft's gonna have trouble now. This is the week or soon anyway
[01:13:04.380 --> 01:13:10.300]   Rumors say in the next two weeks. We're going to see this lumi and 900 you said you never see another one of these phones again
[01:13:10.300 --> 01:13:16.380]   What is that? It's the Nokia windows phone. What do you think? You like it? No
[01:13:16.380 --> 01:13:22.620]   You you hyped it up like it was gonna be great
[01:13:22.620 --> 01:13:28.940]   Well, no, I liked it till I actually had to try to move some files off of it and you have to use zoom software
[01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:32.300]   It's like this the zoom phone just what everybody said
[01:13:32.300 --> 01:13:37.740]   And I and I don't like the zoom software. It's terrible 18 t's taken pre-orders right now
[01:13:37.740 --> 01:13:41.500]   Amazon is taking a pre-order for one cent would it without now much would you pay?
[01:13:41.500 --> 01:13:45.420]   One penny for what of the lumi and 900 but I've played with a lumi
[01:13:45.420 --> 01:13:50.620]   They had it CES it was kind of a semi-working and it's beautiful. Yeah, it's very good
[01:13:50.620 --> 01:13:56.460]   But the 800 feels nice too. Yeah, this is a 710. I'm using because it's got gorilla glass, which I prefer
[01:13:57.180 --> 01:13:59.180]   Is that the 710? Yeah
[01:13:59.180 --> 01:14:02.060]   Uh, I don't know I did now, but I have to say this
[01:14:02.060 --> 01:14:05.100]   You can tap that
[01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:07.100]   I'm tapped that
[01:14:07.100 --> 01:14:10.060]   Let me tap it tap it
[01:14:10.060 --> 01:14:13.020]   You know people are audio. I'm tapping it right now
[01:14:13.020 --> 01:14:15.900]   Wow, can I tap this in the bathroom?
[01:14:15.900 --> 01:14:18.140]   That's up to you
[01:14:18.140 --> 01:14:19.340]   All right
[01:14:19.340 --> 01:14:21.180]   We got sidetracked here
[01:14:21.180 --> 01:14:23.900]   But the but the point being that you've got really too big
[01:14:23.900 --> 01:14:26.700]   competitors apple and android
[01:14:26.700 --> 01:14:32.860]   And then you've got microsoft which is trying as hard as it can and has a much better reputation in my opinion than rim does
[01:14:32.860 --> 01:14:38.380]   Rim is gonna rim is a distant fourth, right? I I mean I think give it up. I mean, I'm on the outside of that
[01:14:38.380 --> 01:14:41.580]   I never used a blackberry and I did and I loved it. I saw people love it
[01:14:41.580 --> 01:14:47.900]   I think of the blackberry as your grandfather smartphone and it just sounds like of a bygone out era five years ago
[01:14:47.900 --> 01:14:53.740]   You know, it's funny. It was it was the only really decent smartphone until out 2007 the iPhone came out
[01:14:53.740 --> 01:14:55.820]   Although you might disagree you like the Nokia
[01:14:56.300 --> 01:15:01.180]   Symbian like the e71 you like their smart. I like those ones with the keyboards. Yeah, yeah
[01:15:01.180 --> 01:15:04.140]   Uh, it's kind of sad, but I think that the
[01:15:04.140 --> 01:15:08.380]   This doesn't look good. Yeah, it doesn't look good at all. Yeah
[01:15:08.380 --> 01:15:15.100]   Uh, but you know, they've made comebacks before but this time they're too stubborn. They should go android
[01:15:15.100 --> 01:15:17.820]   They really should so should Nokia
[01:15:17.820 --> 01:15:20.540]   Yeah, no, no, you should might as well just admit it now, right?
[01:15:20.540 --> 01:15:25.900]   Actually, it's funny because I'm starting to see interesting rumors that google may not go android
[01:15:26.380 --> 01:15:29.180]   google is going to start selling a tablet
[01:15:29.180 --> 01:15:34.940]   Right did they go chrome? They're gonna call it play. This is this I can't remember who wrote this but I could be able to
[01:15:34.940 --> 01:15:39.580]   Know this was this was more supposition. I know it could be
[01:15:39.580 --> 01:15:44.940]   Um, but you know, they moved everything to the google play mark. They android market
[01:15:44.940 --> 01:15:51.500]   Is is play now the books the music the movies the tv it's all play. This is a brand and the problem
[01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:56.220]   I might have to find this article. I can't remember who was uh, who's writing it and he really deserves credit for it
[01:15:56.220 --> 01:16:02.780]   But the problem is they've lost control of the android name. Yeah, completely out of control as as you can expect
[01:16:02.780 --> 01:16:07.020]   It's it's what lamar was saying with brand dilution. It's like what is an android android used to mean something
[01:16:07.020 --> 01:16:12.300]   It meant that the google phone but then once it stopped meaning that it became 18 billion different flavors and every 20 minutes
[01:16:12.300 --> 01:16:17.260]   There's a new dessert named version of it and it's like you just throw up your hands. You're like, I don't even know
[01:16:18.220 --> 01:16:24.380]   You see what amazon did to it. They just came in and say hey, this is ours. They don't even they even call it an android, you know device
[01:16:24.380 --> 01:16:28.300]   It's hilarious, right and they just kind of kind of just spat in google say sir
[01:16:28.300 --> 01:16:34.380]   Yeah, so I suspect I think this this makes a lot of sense that google will start selling tablets
[01:16:34.380 --> 01:16:38.060]   They'll call them play tablets not android tablets. They'll be powered by android still right?
[01:16:38.060 --> 01:16:42.940]   It might say it could be a power well it will say powered by android
[01:16:42.940 --> 01:16:44.460]   I don't think they're going to give up on android
[01:16:44.620 --> 01:16:47.580]   I think they're giving up on the brand and attempting to make that their brand
[01:16:47.580 --> 01:16:53.900]   See I guess I thought that was their intention from the very beginning if you're going to totally open source it and give it to everyone
[01:16:53.900 --> 01:16:58.300]   That's what happens you lose it. Yeah, exactly. Yeah, they still got a little robot everywhere
[01:16:58.300 --> 01:17:02.220]   That's true, but I wonder I wonder I wonder for how long
[01:17:02.220 --> 01:17:05.180]   This is dan roinsky writing and read write
[01:17:05.180 --> 01:17:07.500]   web
[01:17:07.500 --> 01:17:09.020]   Earlier this week
[01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:12.940]   Can I ask a question kind of off topic sure how unlike what is what is bob
[01:17:13.500 --> 01:17:19.980]   Hyle doing with this other microphone that's all chrome and shiny because he went a flat color here and his look at his
[01:17:19.980 --> 01:17:22.220]   Thing it's all shining the bling dude a different
[01:17:22.220 --> 01:17:29.260]   Oh, we got some new ones. Yeah, and they're and they're very shiny. Yeah, um, you know, it's funny. I once asked winton marsalis
[01:17:29.260 --> 01:17:33.660]   Oh, really? What did winton have to say winton very famously?
[01:17:33.660 --> 01:17:38.780]   Or was it branford? I can never you know who plays the trumpet one of them one of them
[01:17:38.940 --> 01:17:43.900]   It was I once asked marsalis because his trumpet is very dull. He does not have a shiny trumpet
[01:17:43.900 --> 01:17:48.780]   Yeah, you want to be out. He has a dull trump. I said why he says the sound is better. I don't understand why the sound would be better
[01:17:48.780 --> 01:17:52.300]   Well, I think it's just a distraction. It's so shiny
[01:17:52.300 --> 01:17:56.860]   You want to kind of not a flat color. I'm like, I can't get my eyes on it
[01:17:56.860 --> 01:18:00.140]   Your eyes are drawn to my shiny mic. I'll be sleeping in a second
[01:18:00.140 --> 01:18:06.940]   But maybe he doesn't want people to look at his trumpet. No, I you this is you don't look at my trumpet
[01:18:07.660 --> 01:18:13.660]   Whatever you do ask it. So you got new mics a bunch of new mics. They're all shiny like the new the new ones are shiny
[01:18:13.660 --> 01:18:16.060]   Huh? Yeah, I think I'm pretty sure it was win
[01:18:16.060 --> 01:18:19.660]   He's got the dull trumpet
[01:18:19.660 --> 01:18:23.820]   Okay, sorry. I brought it up. Yeah, I have to actually at this point
[01:18:23.820 --> 01:18:26.620]   Um, so howard stringer is out
[01:18:26.620 --> 01:18:31.580]   Sir howard stringer is out at sony zony has a new ceo
[01:18:31.580 --> 01:18:36.780]   Uh, I always thought it was weird that the british guy was the ceo it was weird. It's so totally weird
[01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:42.940]   Is that and what was the point of it? He didn't do anything while I was there. He just was just a lot of bluster today kazoo
[01:18:42.940 --> 01:18:44.300]   hooray
[01:18:44.300 --> 01:18:46.300]   becomes sony's president and
[01:18:46.300 --> 01:18:51.260]   Uh ceo so I wrote a call and I believe it was in market watch could have been in pc magazine
[01:18:51.260 --> 01:18:53.260]   I can't remember I know they all blurred up, but
[01:18:53.260 --> 01:18:56.060]   I suggest the following
[01:18:56.060 --> 01:19:00.780]   sony divvy up the company this is the only solution they have to split the company into three
[01:19:00.780 --> 01:19:06.780]   The entertain the same thing for microsoft. Yes. I did four for microsoft nowadays. Yeah, uh,
[01:19:07.100 --> 01:19:14.620]   They should split out three companies the movie entertainment the record movies that yes, that's a mess then the computer hardware
[01:19:14.620 --> 01:19:19.500]   consumer electronics stuff that that can keep the sony brand because that's what you think
[01:19:19.500 --> 01:19:27.420]   Of sony no baloney and then the third would be the professional division with the broadcast equipment medical equipment all that stuff
[01:19:27.420 --> 01:19:30.620]   So it's interesting because it's exactly what the new ceo is not doing
[01:19:30.620 --> 01:19:33.340]   I noticed
[01:19:33.340 --> 01:19:36.060]   His new strategy is called one sony
[01:19:36.060 --> 01:19:42.140]   Yeah, and he wants to bring back the television set as the as the kind of the hallmark of the new sony
[01:19:42.140 --> 01:19:49.500]   Yeah, I know this is that same article the same same argument about brand where you confuse it by being too many things right?
[01:19:49.500 --> 01:19:57.340]   Um sony, which was the consumer electronics brand has completely lost it to brands that were for a long time cheesy
[01:19:57.340 --> 01:19:59.580]   Samsung he's a cheesy brand
[01:20:00.060 --> 01:20:05.020]   LG used to stand for lucky gold star. Yeah, it was the tv set you bought in the back of kmart
[01:20:05.020 --> 01:20:10.700]   Yeah, and and sony was this this is the set and it's completely lost that uh, yeah
[01:20:10.700 --> 01:20:13.260]   I agree they should have a now
[01:20:13.260 --> 01:20:18.140]   I mean, I guess really the real answer is they never should have put in put everything under the sony brand to begin with
[01:20:18.140 --> 01:20:20.860]   It's it takes a lot more time than ever to build a brand from scratch
[01:20:20.860 --> 01:20:24.300]   That's why everyone loves the shortcut of borrowing from the more popular brand
[01:20:24.300 --> 01:20:27.260]   That's why you know, there's uh, you know miller high life was a popular beer
[01:20:27.580 --> 01:20:33.180]   Uh, then then when they came out with light the light version they didn't want to just call it light because they what's the 64 thing
[01:20:33.180 --> 01:20:36.540]   What is that all about the six? Oh the six four calories is that how many calories it is?
[01:20:36.540 --> 01:20:43.260]   It's like a half beer nasty. I see the the answer cute. Yeah, but uh, but any in fact, you know, what what happened the confusion
[01:20:43.260 --> 01:20:48.540]   I don't even know. I don't know. What is that too? What is that beer? I don't know that well now you get these sub sub categories
[01:20:48.540 --> 01:20:51.340]   Where it's like you have bud light which is a subcattery glory of bud wiser
[01:20:51.340 --> 01:20:57.660]   Right then bud white becomes more popular than bud wiser. So now they start trying to divvy off from that category making bud light lime and bud light
[01:20:57.660 --> 01:21:01.260]   You know, that's the flavor. I like blue. I hear they got a blue
[01:21:01.260 --> 01:21:09.420]   But you get a grocery outlet. Yeah, yahoo layoff said to begin next week restructuring the week after says kara swisher and all things d
[01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:12.860]   So yeah, I never want to
[01:21:12.860 --> 01:21:17.260]   You know, it's it may it's fun to make fun of yahoo, but you know, they're easy target
[01:21:17.260 --> 01:21:20.700]   But you know you hate to see people lose their jobs. I you know
[01:21:20.700 --> 01:21:27.500]   If anything that needs to be saved is flicker. I don't know if anyone agrees that that somehow needs to be bought by somebody because
[01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:32.780]   I think that's their only property. That's really awesome. Yahoo has 14,000 employees
[01:21:32.780 --> 01:21:41.420]   It is said thousands will be laid off the cuts will be deep. That's that that's that mostly aimed at product research and marketing units
[01:21:41.420 --> 01:21:46.460]   Uh, you know, what's what's even sadder is that the yahoo product is still a good product
[01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:49.020]   Yahoo content sites like flicker are good
[01:21:49.020 --> 01:21:52.620]   Uh, yahoo has a considerable number of good content sites
[01:21:52.620 --> 01:21:57.900]   No, they're they're just a just a marketing that's screwed up. Well, that's apparently who's gonna
[01:21:57.900 --> 01:22:01.980]   I mean, I've said this before I mentioned it in many of column
[01:22:01.980 --> 01:22:06.540]   I'm always stunned because every so often yahoo says well, we're gonna cancel this
[01:22:06.540 --> 01:22:11.020]   We've had it for two years and now we're killing it and they kill some product you look at it and go each
[01:22:11.020 --> 01:22:15.980]   You say I never heard of this if I had known about it. I would have loved it. I would have used it
[01:22:16.620 --> 01:22:19.180]   And how you know that that happens over and over with them
[01:22:19.180 --> 01:22:25.340]   By the way youtube uploads now an hour of video every second
[01:22:25.340 --> 01:22:30.300]   That's awesome. That's nothing but good. This is this is the time
[01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:36.140]   This is the first generation where an accurate depression of our time will survive for hundreds and thousands of years
[01:22:36.140 --> 01:22:38.860]   History begins in the early 21st century
[01:22:38.860 --> 01:22:41.660]   1000 years we don't look at me that way
[01:22:42.300 --> 01:22:44.300]   I'm visionary
[01:22:44.300 --> 01:22:48.620]   No, I am agree. I am with you. Although who's gonna watch all that video without
[01:22:48.620 --> 01:22:51.820]   I'm always attracted when someone goes cornball
[01:22:51.820 --> 01:23:02.140]   You know, I think on youtube what's gonna be really important says there's so much video and I got these original channels tomorrow these all launch right
[01:23:02.140 --> 01:23:07.980]   Yeah, well a lot of them I started already. Oh, okay. I think I think they're launching out some Felicia days that launches tomorrow
[01:23:08.460 --> 01:23:13.180]   Yeah, you're gonna have to carve out a niche for yourself or if you're in a UK a niche
[01:23:13.180 --> 01:23:20.380]   Um, but yeah, you're gonna have to be somehow different and and unique because it's too much video out there
[01:23:20.380 --> 01:23:23.180]   You're gonna get a buried does it threaten you a little bit Lamar?
[01:23:23.180 --> 01:23:25.740]   I mean here you are you've got a youtube channel very successful
[01:23:25.740 --> 01:23:32.220]   But is it scary that there's so many people there's 60 hours of new video every minute being uploaded to youtube
[01:23:32.220 --> 01:23:36.380]   I mean, it did it did bother me when I when I was you know, not
[01:23:36.780 --> 01:23:41.580]   Yesterday, but as I was hearing about this. I think joining you see more more youtubers joining networks
[01:23:41.580 --> 01:23:46.060]   Like you know I joined revision three, you know, there's maker studios. There's big frame. It's all is different
[01:23:46.060 --> 01:23:49.820]   You see a lot of the big ones have done that. Why what does the advantage of that?
[01:23:49.820 --> 01:23:55.820]   Um protection well first of all you get protection from click bombing. You don't have to deal with that kind of issue
[01:23:55.820 --> 01:24:04.220]   Um, what's click bombing? I'm sorry. Well, it's basically when people would go to your your youtube click all your your ads and they click them over and over again
[01:24:04.620 --> 01:24:11.020]   You know ads that will just say, um, you know, they're gonna disable your account and they won't appeal and then you are no longer a partner
[01:24:11.020 --> 01:24:17.340]   And make you can't get money. So, you know, basically in other words, you've hired revision three as an enforcer basically
[01:24:17.340 --> 01:24:20.620]   It's like it's like my bodyguard
[01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:26.540]   These guys were stealing your lunch money and now you got this big kid who's gonna come in and and this is one of the things that bothers me
[01:24:26.540 --> 01:24:28.700]   Cause we don't have an enforcer and google screw
[01:24:28.700 --> 01:24:33.900]   You know youtube screws are this all the time like uh wednesday when they pulled down this week in google because they said yeah
[01:24:33.900 --> 01:24:40.060]   We own that and we don't have an enforcer. So you need an enforcer. Yeah, I mean revision three can be you know
[01:24:40.060 --> 01:24:43.180]   They they could talk directly to people at youtube
[01:24:43.180 --> 01:24:50.860]   So that that gives me that protection and advantage and plus, you know distribution and you get a you know higher monetization
[01:24:50.860 --> 01:24:57.340]   So that's that's why you're gonna see so a lot of clusters happen on youtube because people are trying to kind of keep their turf
[01:24:57.340 --> 01:25:02.780]   You know to themselves it's gonna be this year's gonna be really interesting to see how youtube kind of divides us up
[01:25:02.940 --> 01:25:09.580]   How did revision three get to that point? I mean how do you be cuz why is it that twit doesn't have that kind of clout with uh with google
[01:25:09.580 --> 01:25:12.780]   But revision three does do we know for a fact they do well
[01:25:12.780 --> 01:25:20.380]   They definitely do but revision three actually has people whose dedicated job is to be the youtube liaison to to handle all the youtube channels to handle all the social
[01:25:20.380 --> 01:25:23.820]   Every time i've talked to youtube their idiots
[01:25:23.820 --> 01:25:26.460]   They don't know what we they've never heard of twit
[01:25:26.460 --> 01:25:32.860]   They don't you know i said i want to be on youtube live we do uh 40 50 hours worth of high quality live programming every week
[01:25:33.100 --> 01:25:35.100]   They said yeah, you could do that, but you have to take your ads off
[01:25:35.100 --> 01:25:37.340]   Wow
[01:25:37.340 --> 01:25:41.900]   But you know what we do yeah, I said if cnn came to you and said we'd like to put cnn on youtube live
[01:25:41.900 --> 01:25:43.660]   Would you say you have to take the ads off this yeah?
[01:25:43.660 --> 01:25:49.980]   Well, I they do they do exercise muscle in that way because I know that there have been shows that I had to restructure
[01:25:49.980 --> 01:25:54.140]   Based on only having one ad per show instead of two embedded ads first per show
[01:25:54.140 --> 01:25:59.900]   Vision three made a deal where they could give at least one ad on i guess so i guess so i mean i'm calling them idiots
[01:25:59.900 --> 01:26:05.580]   Is not such a good idea for this political purposes i should i should be able to call them idiots
[01:26:05.580 --> 01:26:08.060]   Don't you think i don't i don't i don't
[01:26:08.060 --> 01:26:12.940]   Are you saying now lamare could you call google or youtube idiots on your show i'll call medians
[01:26:12.940 --> 01:26:16.140]   I wouldn't because no
[01:26:16.140 --> 01:26:18.300]   sold out
[01:26:18.300 --> 01:26:23.100]   I'm i just happen to be on a feature list of google plus so i'm not gonna you know i want to be very nice
[01:26:23.100 --> 01:26:25.260]   I'm not on that either by all yeah
[01:26:25.260 --> 01:26:27.740]   I need a youtube guy apparently
[01:26:28.140 --> 01:26:32.060]   Well, i'll tell you if you do have a youtube guy like ironically the this is i need an irony check
[01:26:32.060 --> 01:26:38.780]   Is it ironic that the scam school web channel on youtube got shut down for a violation of for being a scam
[01:26:38.780 --> 01:26:43.580]   Like it's like it said uh multiple violations. This is what i mean these people are freaking moron
[01:26:43.580 --> 01:26:45.980]   Something got it's called scam school
[01:26:45.980 --> 01:26:51.100]   Something something got flipped on the switch somewhere and it took a phone call to get the page back up
[01:26:51.100 --> 01:26:54.460]   But i was just i just got a tweet out of nowhere. They're like you realize scam school got taken down
[01:26:54.460 --> 01:26:58.620]   Where to god youtube is run by a python script so so tomorrow
[01:26:58.620 --> 01:27:03.260]   No, i'm not even joking that's actually the sad truth getting better by the minute
[01:27:03.260 --> 01:27:09.500]   Do you worry lamare about these youtube uh celebrity channels youtube took a hundred million dollars
[01:27:09.500 --> 01:27:12.540]   And went to people like flicher day and said build a channel
[01:27:12.540 --> 01:27:16.300]   Doesn't that threaten you and uh and and uh
[01:27:16.300 --> 01:27:20.060]   No, no, it legitimizes new media in general
[01:27:20.060 --> 01:27:27.180]   This is this is part of a general flight to quality that will shape the perception of new media and hopefully be a rising tide for all of us
[01:27:27.180 --> 01:27:30.780]   You got to remember we are in the early days of something revolutionary
[01:27:30.780 --> 01:27:36.220]   This is the 1970s of cable where nobody knows what the rules are and we're trying to establish what new media means
[01:27:36.220 --> 01:27:39.180]   And in the old days whoever is their first one on cable
[01:27:39.180 --> 01:27:43.900]   CNN was the first cable news 24 hour news network and because nobody was watching it first
[01:27:43.900 --> 01:27:49.580]   But then as cable became a legitimate platform cnn rose to the top and likewise as new media gets
[01:27:49.580 --> 01:27:51.580]   Legitimize twits only gonna benefit
[01:27:51.580 --> 01:27:53.980]   BTS that's wrong
[01:27:53.980 --> 01:27:58.060]   No, because what's gonna happen is google's gonna dominate and independence are gonna go away
[01:27:58.060 --> 01:28:05.820]   And youtube both demonstrated you cannot be independent actually i i would have to agree with him with who mr. utopia here
[01:28:05.820 --> 01:28:09.900]   You think it's good for us spiky spiky spiky right here independence
[01:28:09.900 --> 01:28:15.900]   Yeah, you don't think of that threatens independence. Yeah, how can you succeed without a youtube guy? You don't need a youtube guy
[01:28:16.780 --> 01:28:21.420]   Are you on youtube no well there you go. It's why you don't need a youtube guy
[01:28:21.420 --> 01:28:25.580]   I want you to tech grouch and the tech hippie run or
[01:28:25.580 --> 01:28:32.540]   on youtube and I still have the the bear the uh barn he had two almost three million hits
[01:28:32.540 --> 01:28:37.820]   You're just your doll dancing. Yeah nothing to celebrate john. I'm just saying
[01:28:37.820 --> 01:28:45.500]   No, legal for new channels. It is really hard but people who are established at least have a
[01:28:45.900 --> 01:28:51.020]   Precisely my point. I got like that's why it is not the utopia for new media. It is bad
[01:28:51.020 --> 01:28:53.900]   It is it it only promotes established
[01:28:53.900 --> 01:28:57.020]   It helps if your
[01:28:57.020 --> 01:28:59.820]   Enforces like um, you know, brian was saying last
[01:28:59.820 --> 01:29:04.700]   Quality your quality has to rise up. You know, they're they're pumping in moves about them to channels
[01:29:04.700 --> 01:29:09.900]   The quality is gonna be high and that's why the barmi video does so well because quality is so
[01:29:09.900 --> 01:29:12.460]   That's exactly why they need to spend this money
[01:29:12.460 --> 01:29:18.940]   And that's why they're going to trusted partners because they need to they need to shake a reputation that good that youtube's where you go to see
[01:29:18.940 --> 01:29:21.820]   Someone kicked in the nuts or a barn ball dance. I agree
[01:29:21.820 --> 01:29:27.660]   Although i'm not gonna be something more than that that paul and storm will not eventually resort to kicking people in the nuts on heat and sundry
[01:29:27.660 --> 01:29:32.620]   But uh that so they and uh very own tom and veronica sword and laser will be part of this
[01:29:32.620 --> 01:29:35.420]   The fact of just the basic
[01:29:35.420 --> 01:29:41.900]   IP tv model which can bypass any of these systems is enough to i hope you're right
[01:29:42.380 --> 01:29:45.100]   Yeah, i am right good. Thank god. You're right
[01:29:45.100 --> 01:29:48.220]   Thank god. You're right
[01:29:48.220 --> 01:29:53.420]   Did you see i want to take a break and then when we come back we're gonna show i don't know what is wrong with his kid

[01:32:02.780 --> 01:32:08.940]   I just finished 11 22 63, which I love way better ending the most of king's otherwise very
[01:32:08.940 --> 01:32:12.220]   He tends to peter out at the ending, but he did a very satisfying end on that
[01:32:12.220 --> 01:32:14.060]   You know, it's funny paul thorett and I were talking about it
[01:32:14.060 --> 01:32:16.540]   He hadn't come to the end yet and he was saying i'm hoping he's not gonna ruin the end
[01:32:16.540 --> 01:32:20.700]   I'm hoping he's not yeah, and it ends beautifully. Yes and surprisingly. Yes quite well done
[01:32:20.700 --> 01:32:26.620]   Uh, he says his son came up with it at the end. Did you know that? No, I'm glad i'm glad i fully expected it
[01:32:27.020 --> 01:32:31.580]   To end with him going out and you never finding out what the repercussions of it
[01:32:31.580 --> 01:32:35.740]   Other war, but he doesn't do that. He's no in fact is fascinating what happens. It's really good
[01:32:35.740 --> 01:32:39.900]   I don't want to know spoilers, but yeah, he says well, this is another reason to get audible
[01:32:39.900 --> 01:32:44.380]   Often has additional material in this case an interview with steven king at the end
[01:32:44.380 --> 01:32:47.820]   In which he says yeah, I got to give credit to my son. I had a different ending
[01:32:47.820 --> 01:32:54.140]   And my son who's also a novelist said son is writing a bunch of zombie related stuff, right? Yeah, yeah very interesting

[01:35:42.380 --> 01:35:48.460]   i i think john gets it man i tell you i tell you brief that was great on c de vorac well i didn't
[01:35:48.460 --> 01:35:54.380]   do anything tom marrot very nice tom had a little cold today but otherwise it was in fine fettle
[01:35:54.380 --> 01:36:01.260]   wow uh so let me show this uh video and then we're gonna wrap this uh puppy up what do you say
[01:36:01.260 --> 01:36:05.980]   chair this is this is uh this is and there's more news but who the hell cares uh
[01:36:05.980 --> 01:36:13.660]   this is not an april fools joke i don't think this is a guy uh who is 16 years old and of course it had
[01:36:13.660 --> 01:36:19.820]   to be because only 16 year olds have enough time how long you play minecraft right i play just
[01:36:19.820 --> 01:36:25.980]   the tiny just enough to know how hard this would be yeah i love minecraft for the record just for
[01:36:25.980 --> 01:36:31.820]   the chat room i love you lie you're such a liar what what is your favorite what is your favorite
[01:36:31.820 --> 01:36:42.300]   material so diamonds who doesn't love diamonds or and and my little pony pinky does so for those
[01:36:42.300 --> 01:36:46.620]   who don't know minecraft is an amazing game nachary we were talking about earlier wrote it uh it just
[01:36:46.620 --> 01:36:51.420]   kind of i think off hand because it was because nobody knew this would be a hit it was it's all
[01:36:51.420 --> 01:36:57.340]   in eight bits it's very clunky very chunky and you have this hand just this this club that you can
[01:36:57.340 --> 01:37:02.380]   hit things collect stuff there at night falls there are creeps who will come after you you have to
[01:37:02.380 --> 01:37:07.100]   defend yourself usually you want to build something but you can build a lot of things with a lot of
[01:37:07.100 --> 01:37:16.780]   effort this is an operating uh this is like a scientific calculator okay now now think about
[01:37:16.780 --> 01:37:21.340]   it this way now you roll your eyes and be like get a life but you realize that by having a very
[01:37:21.340 --> 01:37:27.900]   simple virtual space with reliable rules this is the kind of this is this is the the great great
[01:37:27.900 --> 01:37:33.020]   grandson of of Charles babaj's difference it is because it's all mechanical this is not digital
[01:37:33.020 --> 01:37:38.780]   right i mean it's he has to do multiplication he has to do division he's got bcd debinary
[01:37:38.780 --> 01:37:46.940]   decoders he's got memory he's got square root log sign and cosign i mean this thing and it's all
[01:37:46.940 --> 01:37:53.900]   mechanical i mean it is it is babaj's uh inferenced at machine now he says but will it blend this
[01:37:53.900 --> 01:37:58.540]   yeah well that's the thing when i look at this that's the thing i think about is how easy this would
[01:37:58.540 --> 01:38:04.540]   be to break will it come alive i mean you've got to be very very i mean the amount of detail and
[01:38:04.540 --> 01:38:12.060]   refinement in making this thing now it's not super fast so you can add subtract multiply divide log
[01:38:12.060 --> 01:38:18.060]   sign cosign tangent square root and square it also is a graphing calculator you can do linear
[01:38:18.060 --> 01:38:23.740]   quadratic plot graphs equates this is amazing yes that's critical what do you want me to do uh
[01:38:23.740 --> 01:38:29.420]   let's see quadratic equation 1507 there i don't know oh my god it does graph look at this yeah that's
[01:38:29.420 --> 01:38:38.860]   the graphing calculator you're right no girlfriend involved at all yeah but this is also i mean
[01:38:38.860 --> 01:38:43.660]   we roll this kid's obviously a genius right there's no i mean this is non-trivial i don't even i can't
[01:38:43.660 --> 01:38:48.780]   even imagine how you begin to tackle now i hear be at the nsa next week yeah exactly well and not
[01:38:48.780 --> 01:38:53.900]   only for for his smarts in putting this together but to be somebody who's a self-starter and has
[01:38:53.900 --> 01:38:59.020]   he built a breakdown large projects and go about them on his own and and uh thank god he's not getting
[01:38:59.020 --> 01:39:07.500]   laid because i know so i admire i admire his parents because he obviously spent hours in his room
[01:39:07.500 --> 01:39:13.420]   somebody says this takes a lot of red bull maybe that's it maybe maybe i mean who knows but look at
[01:39:13.420 --> 01:39:18.620]   look at this so you you actually have to jump up and down to punch a number it's took a lot of
[01:39:18.620 --> 01:39:25.180]   taps oh that's awesome i mean i can't believe unless this is an april fools joke no i think this
[01:39:25.180 --> 01:39:30.860]   is real i think i really do think this is real uh a lot of hot pockets going into this one books uh
[01:39:31.900 --> 01:39:38.540]   and and pepsi blue now i wonder i i assume he has to release this so everyone can have their own
[01:39:38.540 --> 01:39:44.300]   instance version of it i hope so uh you can now you can save this out in minecraft you can save it
[01:39:44.300 --> 01:39:48.860]   out and then you could give it to somebody to put on their server right uh yes somebody has done
[01:39:48.860 --> 01:39:52.700]   the entire twit brick house actually oh my god my number of brick house looks amazing it's quite
[01:39:52.700 --> 01:39:56.780]   well done yeah there was also a while ago i want to say it was like back in november there was somebody
[01:39:56.780 --> 01:40:02.380]   actually made an eight-bit cpu that uh similar but it didn't look as pretty as this this is pretty
[01:40:02.380 --> 01:40:08.540]   amazing i'll tell you man uh the future architects the future engineers of 20 years from now are all
[01:40:08.540 --> 01:40:16.220]   playing minecraft right now cheeto in the chatroom uh chatcraft is the server yeah is the server and
[01:40:16.220 --> 01:40:21.420]   cheeto and a number of other people in uh in the chat room did that well it was really nice job to
[01:40:21.420 --> 01:40:28.380]   divorce as devorek let's say ah this going nowhere saying that well marz board wow
[01:40:28.380 --> 01:40:33.500]   all right well you get the okay i'll let it be watching very slow numbers get into nowhere but
[01:40:33.500 --> 01:40:38.540]   the kids go in somewhere the kids is going somewhere i love john yeah that's that's pretty amazing anyway
[01:40:38.540 --> 01:40:42.620]   we'll uh we'll bomb out of that but you can go to tom's hardware to see that or uh other places that's
[01:40:42.620 --> 01:40:48.220]   where we're playing it from uh and it is on youtube as well just real quickly i'm gonna check through
[01:40:48.220 --> 01:40:54.380]   these stories half of us cellular subscribers on smartphones uh there are there nearly a
[01:40:54.380 --> 01:41:01.340]   billion smart devices were shipped last year uh over for the first year first time ever in 2011
[01:41:01.340 --> 01:41:08.540]   digital beat out physical that's a big one in music in music and streaming services gained 300
[01:41:08.540 --> 01:41:16.140]   thousand subscribers in 2011 uh we didn't end up talking about uh what is it called girls around me
[01:41:16.780 --> 01:41:19.340]   oh yeah the girl's talking out very upset this is gone
[01:41:19.340 --> 01:41:27.180]   um it's uh it's was on the app store the real question is why apple approved it it is a girl
[01:41:27.180 --> 01:41:33.900]   stalking app that uses public data fair four square data to figure out if there are any women
[01:41:33.900 --> 01:41:40.300]   around well it's not stalking so much as it's i just want to see if you're near me so i can knock
[01:41:40.300 --> 01:41:46.940]   on your door and night late late well maybe not even knock maybe i'll show you my google tap
[01:41:46.940 --> 01:41:54.220]   whoa um so it's an art it should have been banned uh it raises some issues certainly
[01:41:54.220 --> 01:41:58.700]   you see now i read this i didn't read this as being serious as all i read this as being a
[01:41:58.700 --> 01:42:02.780]   cautionary tale to let people know that they're putting public and from private information in the
[01:42:02.780 --> 01:42:09.020]   book look at the uh look at the uh launch screen and tell me what this app is for well i mean
[01:42:09.020 --> 01:42:15.020]   again i i think it's a very good look at that that green thing i said yeah this is a stalking app
[01:42:15.020 --> 01:42:19.740]   it's a little creepy it's a little creepy but anyway i i've always believed that four square
[01:42:19.740 --> 01:42:24.620]   and all these things were just pretty much tools for stalkers well i'm funny i most of the
[01:42:24.620 --> 01:42:33.180]   women i know will not use four square um except except for one but uh maybe now this will make
[01:42:33.180 --> 01:42:39.020]   people more aware of that i guess uh ebooks are the fastest growing area of book sales especially
[01:42:39.020 --> 01:42:43.580]   and this is not a surprise with young people no these things are skyrocketing it's only the beginning
[01:42:43.580 --> 01:42:48.140]   just the beginning i'll tell you what and this guy sitting over here on the end over here's
[01:42:48.140 --> 01:42:51.980]   already made like a half a million dollars i knew it's game school book going it's doing really really
[01:42:51.980 --> 01:42:57.020]   well this guy you won't even come on the show did you get to number one uh you know what we got uh
[01:42:57.020 --> 01:43:02.380]   we got number one in canada we hit number three in the u.s because we released the same day as this
[01:43:02.380 --> 01:43:09.260]   50 shades of gray it's erotic bdsm fanfiction based on twilight oh they've already got movie
[01:43:09.260 --> 01:43:13.420]   right but that they're never gonna be right so we're very very happy with the release but more
[01:43:13.420 --> 01:43:18.060]   importantly i'm amazed at uh the reviews have been insane people are calling you the game changer
[01:43:18.060 --> 01:43:23.020]   for educational books because you're using video you're using audio it's multi-media i don't have my
[01:43:23.020 --> 01:43:27.180]   iPad here at show people but it's really cool get the if you can get the iBook version because
[01:43:27.180 --> 01:43:31.340]   that really is the best it's it's slightly better uh in order right now iBooks looks best second
[01:43:31.340 --> 01:43:36.300]   place goes to the Barnes and Noble nook because that's ePub uh and depending on what device you're
[01:43:36.300 --> 01:43:40.300]   viewing it on they are updating the Kindle app so it's just gonna look better better in the next
[01:43:40.300 --> 01:43:44.620]   month or so the android version is gonna look as good as any of the other ones but uh but the
[01:43:44.620 --> 01:43:49.740]   the platform we did it on book.com uh asked if they could it was a weird call because they're like hey
[01:43:49.740 --> 01:43:55.180]   we would like to make your book the official case study for book.com it's like if you look like
[01:43:55.180 --> 01:43:59.020]   it's on it's on the front page now of book.com i think it's like look look look in there
[01:43:59.020 --> 01:44:02.940]   book v-o-okay because you got all these different publishing platforms and they're all
[01:44:02.940 --> 01:44:10.060]   contrary to each other it's it's one it's one it's a book with a v you build it on look this was made

[01:45:20.700 --> 01:45:26.140]   They should use all that social media we could track asteroids around us. Channel.devorak.com.
[01:45:26.140 --> 01:45:31.420]   That's the place to go for more John C. Devorak. You've got a post that uh. Also romney
[01:45:31.980 --> 01:45:37.580]   sucks sucks. Dot org. Dot org. Dot org. Also I think Sean Hannity is also one of ours.
[01:45:37.580 --> 01:45:42.140]   Is he? We have over a thousand people that have forwarded crazy domain names. So if I type Sean
[01:45:42.140 --> 01:45:48.620]   Hannity sucks. Dot com. Sean Hannity.com. You own Sean Hannity.com? We don't own anything.
[01:45:48.620 --> 01:45:55.980]   I get a call on the radio. It does. Oh my god. We don't. Sean Hannity ought to be pissed at that.
[01:45:55.980 --> 01:46:00.700]   I don't know why he doesn't talk to the diss folks. If you own a domain name that you're not using
[01:46:00.700 --> 01:46:06.940]   just have it pointed no agenda. No agenda show. Dot com. And make good use of it. We don't own any
[01:46:06.940 --> 01:46:12.380]   of these outside domains. Somebody call the radio show said I am a registered lot of domain names.
[01:46:12.380 --> 01:46:15.820]   He was on hold for an hour and a half. I registered now in the domains. I want to know how to make
[01:46:15.820 --> 01:46:21.340]   money selling you don't domain names. And I said well what do you guys? He said well I have one
