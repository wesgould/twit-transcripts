[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.320]   It's time for Twit. This week in Tech, I'm Jason Howell, filling in for Leo along with
[00:00:05.320 --> 00:00:09.920]   Ann Pruitt and Micah Sargent. We're here in studio talking about all the news from this
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:15.640]   week. Apple Pay versus Starbucks and what's going on with mobile payments there. We meet
[00:00:15.640 --> 00:00:21.160]   Micah's Elvis laptop. Also, I just got the new Pixel 4 XL. Something a little excited
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:27.520]   about that. Jeff Bezos lost the title as Rich's Man in the World for a very quick moment.
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:34.520]   The Facebook launched its news portal again. That and more up next on This Week in Tech.

[00:02:11.840 --> 00:02:22.800]   It's time for Twit. This week in tech. Unfortunately Leo the Port is not with us today. He is
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:30.560]   traveling the world so you get me. Sorry folks. I'm Jason Howell sitting in Leo's chair surrounded
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:36.360]   by other Twit just magical people. And to prove it.
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:40.760]   I have my moments. I have my moments where I'm magical. I admit that because I am not
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:46.920]   a mere mortal like you all. Well you are. You're now a Twit. That's all it takes. Good
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.640]   to see you. Also Micah Sergeant to my right. Hello Micah Magical Sergeant is something no
[00:02:53.640 --> 00:02:56.320]   one's ever called me. No that's okay. That's okay.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:03:00.360]   But it doesn't ever have to happen again actually. You know what is magical? What's that? Having
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:06.080]   a utility company that's a privately owned utility company and having them make decisions
[00:03:06.080 --> 00:03:10.960]   that result in us recording a show that we usually record on Sundays on a Friday. Yeah.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:15.200]   Yeah and that's funny that you mentioned that because oddly enough that's what happened.
[00:03:15.200 --> 00:03:21.600]   So we are here a few days ago. What we're recording a few days early. We're still going
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:26.240]   out tomorrow right. Some Saturday instead of Sunday. That sounds really quite sure.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.960]   Ultimately there's a strong possibility that the studio's power is going to be shut off
[00:03:30.960 --> 00:03:35.080]   on Sunday which is when we normally record and release this week in tech. This is my
[00:03:35.080 --> 00:03:39.520]   public safety shut off dance. We're so excited about it.
[00:03:39.520 --> 00:03:43.880]   And we're not saying anything that people aren't familiar with because this happened
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:47.360]   a couple weeks ago. All right. All right. I was out of town when that happened. So I
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:52.560]   thought I dodged a bullet. Welcome. Yeah. We had an issue. It's what that was.
[00:03:52.560 --> 00:03:57.000]   Yeah. Actually we both called PG&E and said now listen. We're going to sell our stock
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.600]   in this thing. You don't make this happen for Jason. Oh great. Well I appreciate it.
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:05.800]   Yeah. Anytime. It's kind of stressful. You know I woke up this morning and I walked
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:11.840]   outside and being from Missouri from the Midwest near Kansas City which by golly has some of
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:17.680]   the best barbecue. That's right. Thank you. I walked out and I said someone's smoking
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:22.520]   brisket right now. Yes. And then I got into the studio and Jason you came in and you were
[00:04:22.520 --> 00:04:28.800]   like so did you smell the fires this morning and I was like oh that's great. Not grandma
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.800]   Virginia smoking brisket. And then at the same time you were on a photo walk this morning
[00:04:33.800 --> 00:04:38.400]   and you were talking about how the sun rise. It was beautiful. It looked great. But I know
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:45.040]   why. Exactly. That's because the sky is filled with smoke and it really does make the sun
[00:04:45.040 --> 00:04:50.040]   look spectacular. It kind of was very boring. It's very different. Very pretty. There's a
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.440]   reason for that beauty. But then the phone started buzzing. Yeah aunt we need you in the
[00:04:55.440 --> 00:05:00.920]   office stat. But did you have a good photo walk at least? I did. My good friend Miss Leana
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:07.720]   came to town and she's one of my mentors with photography and then it was great to see
[00:05:07.720 --> 00:05:12.520]   her again for the first time in a long time and get out there and actually go shoot. This
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:16.600]   is like the third time I've been able to use my camera for leisure since coming here.
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:21.080]   Really? Nice. And I've been here a month. And it's your main account. Yeah. You know
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:26.480]   and it was just great. It was great. And this is not a camera that you're reviewing. This
[00:05:26.480 --> 00:05:32.360]   is just my. This is just going out and shooting and just. All right on. Enjoying the scene.
[00:05:32.360 --> 00:05:38.560]   It was great. And the smell. Yeah. And the smell. You captured the sky before it's even more
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:42.760]   filled with smoke. I just hope that both of you don't don't have to endure what we have
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:48.720]   the last couple of years. I hope not. No overwhelming smoke. I've only bought one air
[00:05:48.720 --> 00:05:53.400]   purifier for my home. And so that's what I'm going to need like two more. If that happens.
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:58.520]   Possibly. Two more and like a hazmat suit and yeah I don't know. I mean it gets really
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:03.320]   intense at a certain point. If the you know the last year the smoke was in the air.
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:08.640]   Mm hmm. Long enough that you you forget what it's like to breathe fresh air. Scary. See
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:14.800]   here's the thing. I get I'm I'm asked to come here. Yeah. And I've talked about this before.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:19.120]   Oh you're going to love it here. Yeah. I love it. I love it here. I'm asked to come here.
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.200]   And no one tells me about this thing called the Sonoma aroma. Which is basically where
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:29.760]   cow dung permeates the air. Oh yeah. It was manure data the day. You know that. It's always
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:36.160]   manure day in Sonoma County when it's warm outside. No one tells me that haircuts are
[00:06:36.160 --> 00:06:41.960]   going to cost me seventy dollars. Oh for that part. Yeah sorry. And then no one told me that
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.720]   the fires are in every year thing now. Yeah. So. We're still trying to figure out if it's
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:51.640]   an every year thing. The last couple of years it's been an every year thing. I honestly thought
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:56.040]   that maybe this was the year it wasn't going to happen yet here we are. Quite full of your
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:01.680]   math on that one sir. Hey now that it's three years in a row. Now it feels like it's going
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:07.120]   to be everything. Yeah. I thought before it was just a coincidence but she's so I'm sorry.
[00:07:07.120 --> 00:07:13.360]   I'm sorry that I personally convinced Jason. Yeah you know it's not your fault. Notice I
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:17.840]   didn't call you Mr. Howl that time. That's all right. You call me whatever you like. I
[00:07:17.840 --> 00:07:24.840]   call do magical. So they're all both of you. This week in fires is coming to a conclusion.
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:32.000]   All right. So that's why we're here on a few days prior and yeah you know it's kind of
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.720]   like the three amigos running the running the show with Leo out. So we can really talk
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:42.640]   about whatever we want. We can't do anything about it. Yeah. Yeah. So so if the choice is
[00:07:42.640 --> 00:07:47.640]   ours to make. What would you like to talk about first? We can we can go Google. We can
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:51.080]   go Apple. We can go Microsoft. I mean if it's my choice I'm going to talk about my
[00:07:51.080 --> 00:07:55.080]   dogs. So you probably don't want it to be my choice. If it was up to me I would say
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:08:00.040]   let me go ahead and just get this Facebook stuff out of our system. Oh man you're just
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:04.480]   like jumping right into the fire. You want to rip off the bandage. Oh the fire. Come on
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:13.240]   too soon. Sorry. All right. So they've been in the news and I don't care for any of it
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:20.440]   but we are a tech studio. Yeah. No I agree. So okay you you at once upon a time you had
[00:08:20.440 --> 00:08:25.120]   a Facebook. Mm-hmm. Sometime back. And then when did you get rid of it? I think it was
[00:08:25.120 --> 00:08:30.560]   2015, 2016 something like that. So you clued in before a lot of people. I was like I'm
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:35.440]   done. I cut it off. Well for me the premise was I wasn't getting anything out of it from
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:42.760]   a small business standpoint as well as engagement was non-existent. I had family members on there
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:49.040]   that never said squat to me unless I posted up something stupid like somebody fighting
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:55.040]   or some weird meme or if I said something totally off the cuff like oh man I'm feeling
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:09:00.200]   sick today. Then all of the engagement shows up. It's almost like people were on Facebook
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:06.320]   to just spread depression or just eating out of stuff but anything thought provoking. I
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:12.680]   got nothing. So I was like on January 1st of such a such year I think it was 2015. I'm
[00:09:12.680 --> 00:09:16.720]   cutting it off and I didn't. I didn't make back sense. I missed it either. Were you worried
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:22.640]   when you cut it off like oh man like what's gonna happen? New. Yeah I didn't think that
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:27.960]   you know I can pick up on that. My mom my mom is still available by phone or text or what
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:33.160]   have you my sister they're still available by phone and the other folks in my family
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:36.560]   they have phones but they change their numbers every other day so they don't really care
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:43.280]   either so I'm good. Alright and then what about you Mike are you on Facebook? So I recently
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:53.960]   returned to the platform because I felt like I had to. So. Because of work or. No because
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:10:01.480]   some company on Facebook took a photo of me they found on the internet. Oh right I remember
[00:10:01.480 --> 00:10:10.520]   that. It was a it was a photo that I took as a hero image for an I'm or article about
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:15.000]   playing Pokemon Go without having to get up off of your couch. So it was me sitting on
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.920]   my couch in a robe with my dogs on my lap sort of like looking lazy. That was the point
[00:10:19.920 --> 00:10:25.960]   of the story. Makes sense. And so that photo that article is pretty popular so it was kind
[00:10:25.960 --> 00:10:29.760]   of all over you know Google through different search terms so I don't know if they looked
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:36.120]   up lazy plus guy or whatever but they found this photo and they took it and they put my
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:44.160]   face next to this random photo of some woman and put us together in this image and then
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:51.840]   they put an article or a headline underneath it that says man like it was the premise of
[00:10:51.840 --> 00:10:58.400]   the story was that the girlfriend would not take the boyfriend off of the lease and so
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:04.760]   he was doing whatever he could to annoy her so that she would remove him from the lease.
[00:11:04.760 --> 00:11:09.520]   And so yeah here's here's the tweet about it. So it essentially looks like I'm being
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:16.040]   a creepy creepster because or at the very least like a spoiled brat because I'm not
[00:11:16.040 --> 00:11:21.560]   getting taken off of a lease and so I'm pestering this woman. And then this story was spread
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:26.040]   all over Facebook because they paid for it to be sponsored. And when you click on the
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:32.760]   article it goes to a story that is not about me obviously this is this was not my past
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:40.160]   and it's different people. And so I had to ask my friends who were on Facebook can you
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:44.560]   please report this article do whatever you can from your end of things and then I'll
[00:11:44.560 --> 00:11:49.200]   try to do whatever I can not being a Facebook user to get this thing removed and there really
[00:11:49.200 --> 00:11:53.800]   wasn't an easy way to do that. Of course. So I ended up making a Facebook account just
[00:11:53.800 --> 00:12:01.600]   for the purpose of having my identity established so that I can say this is me and I am saying
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:09.320]   that that is not okay because that's not my story. Because you know I'm fine now but
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:14.840]   I'm just trying to think of like if for someone who was looking to get a new job or something
[00:12:14.840 --> 00:12:19.800]   like that and their boss was scrolling through Facebook the night before because they normally
[00:12:19.800 --> 00:12:24.400]   scroll through Facebook you see this story and then that changes your because it's my
[00:12:24.400 --> 00:12:29.000]   face like it's my face there and my dogs for God's sake.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:35.520]   Oh yeah there's one thing I know about my cat Henry and Missy don't come at my dog.
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:39.600]   So that was really frustrating and what was the most frustrating is that despite the fact
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:45.360]   you know there's there was always or for a long time a feature to sort of pause your account
[00:12:45.360 --> 00:12:51.200]   on Facebook but Facebook only recently and by recently I mean in the past few years re
[00:12:51.200 --> 00:12:56.760]   added the ability to completely delete your account. And so I completely deleted my account
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:02.400]   removed the whole thing had it gone and had to set up a new account with me and then go
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:10.360]   through and then establish myself yeah to get through that process. So I feel trapped
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:14.880]   to be on the platform and that makes Facebook even more frustrating to me.
[00:13:14.880 --> 00:13:21.280]   Now can I ask you a question with regards to getting that thing taken down how much of
[00:13:21.280 --> 00:13:24.960]   a pushback did you get because I'm pretty sure they had all of the legal leaves saying
[00:13:24.960 --> 00:13:29.520]   well hey when you click accept on these terms and services you agreed to let us show your
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:32.440]   dogs and use your buds samples and everything else.
[00:13:32.440 --> 00:13:37.280]   Yeah so if the photo had been something that I had posted on Facebook I would not have had
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:41.760]   any sort of claim to it. I did not post this photo on Facebook this was a photo published
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:46.360]   in an article that I was paid to write when I worked at a company. They grabbed it from
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:52.080]   the internet and used it on the site. It wasn't anything that I agreed to share on the site.
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:56.480]   So because of that I was able to file a copyright claim for the photo and have it removed that
[00:13:56.480 --> 00:14:03.360]   way. But you're right. If they wanted to take your profile photo and use it in an advertisement
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:08.840]   then I would have been SOL. But in this case that was something that I was able to do.
[00:14:08.840 --> 00:14:17.480]   But it's just I could see I could go through and the ads had been running since I think
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:22.960]   May or June and this was in August I believe. I can't remember when that tweet was sent.
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:29.280]   But for multiple months my face and this young woman's face as well we were both out
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:35.560]   there being attached to the story that had nothing to do with us. And it wasn't Facebook
[00:14:35.560 --> 00:14:40.720]   the company itself it was this company that advertises on Facebook. But the fact that
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:45.120]   I had to become a part of Facebook again in order to do anything about it that's what
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:51.000]   was really frustrating. I had a super frustrating. Yeah. The thing is I don't believe Twitter
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:56.320]   is I mean from this behavior the same thing could happen there. Yeah absolutely. If an
[00:14:56.320 --> 00:14:59.880]   article is out there someone just strips the image like what they did there they can do
[00:14:59.880 --> 00:15:04.680]   the same thing on a Twitter platform and it could go viral with all of the other resears
[00:15:04.680 --> 00:15:12.400]   and stuff. So it's not just Facebook is just online use. Yeah absolutely. Well and so Facebook
[00:15:12.400 --> 00:15:18.160]   of course is in the news this week for a couple of reasons. One it's in the news because it's
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:28.920]   adding some news stuff to its platform. Which if you have even the slightest bit of news
[00:15:28.920 --> 00:15:34.560]   understanding or media intelligence I don't know media literacy. Then you would have immediately
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:42.080]   gone wait what why is Facebook doing this? Because of the way that Facebook is used to
[00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:48.040]   disseminate false information and the way that we've seen time and time again through studies
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:58.640]   that have been done that Facebook is a fantastic vector for spreading news that is inaccurate
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:05.640]   or spreading information that's false. Because of the way that our base lizard brains work
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:12.440]   we want to go to those things that are either they really make us upset or we really really
[00:16:12.440 --> 00:16:16.120]   agree with them. And so what's easier for us to click on those things we really agree
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:21.320]   with or very much disagree with and interact with them and then Facebook's platform builds
[00:16:21.320 --> 00:16:26.560]   and builds and builds. And so Facebook launching this news section and sort of positing that
[00:16:26.560 --> 00:16:33.360]   it's this the creation of it is so that publishers can get money that they need. That's like a
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:39.160]   cool cool cool. But that's not the important thing now maybe five three four or five years
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:45.120]   ago when we were looking at how Facebook was and by we I mean when I worked at the last
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:50.400]   company that I worked for. How important it was to be a part of Facebook or else we were
[00:16:50.400 --> 00:16:55.040]   not making digital money. That's what I was going to ask. You can look at it from the perspective
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:17:02.280]   of a freelancer or you know a journalist that's losing subscribers on their regular site because
[00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:06.800]   of Facebook you know and they're getting trying to do whatever they can to pull those eyeballs
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:11.240]   back to their site and it's just not working. And do you think they were would be receptive
[00:17:11.240 --> 00:17:15.240]   to that and say hey well Facebook's going to give us some money so let's let's go for
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:18.880]   it. Doesn't this all sound super familiar though I feel like we were like you were saying
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:24.960]   we were just here a couple of years ago Facebook's news kind of effort failed you know it was
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:29.520]   it was the big thing publishers were creating content just for it or at least like restructuring
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:34.880]   their content so it fit into their offering and you know a lot of people were screaming
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:39.000]   at the time and saying hey this is a bad idea anytime you're incumbent upon another platform
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.400]   for your success like at any moment that's that rug can be pulled out from under you and
[00:17:43.400 --> 00:17:48.280]   of course that happened. Yet here we are right back there again right back there again the
[00:17:48.280 --> 00:17:55.080]   new app has the new Facebook news section. This time Facebook says that it's well it's
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:17:59.800]   filled by Facebook employees who are free from editorial interventions and one of the big
[00:17:59.800 --> 00:18:05.400]   things around Facebook and news is that you know Facebook would have undue influence over
[00:18:05.400 --> 00:18:11.120]   what would make it to the page or to the feeds versus not and so you know conservative voices
[00:18:11.120 --> 00:18:16.720]   were saying hey you're de emphasizing our content and and all that kind of stuff so Facebook
[00:18:16.720 --> 00:18:21.320]   at least here you know in the launch of this new section today is saying that this is free
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:27.640]   from editorial intervention hopefully that would bypass that but also based on user preferences
[00:18:27.640 --> 00:18:35.280]   so overtime if I seen two broadcast to Facebook through my use that this is a particular story
[00:18:35.280 --> 00:18:41.560]   that would work for me then it would surface that and that's how we end up right that's
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:48.320]   I did. That's the way of the future Micah cognitive this is the thing though cognitive
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:52.200]   dissonance is the way of the past the present and the future because it's how we're built
[00:18:52.200 --> 00:18:59.720]   it's how we think and so we are are prone to our built we are not evolved enough as human
[00:18:59.720 --> 00:19:07.640]   beings yet I would say in many cases to be able to combat the almost like physical pain
[00:19:07.640 --> 00:19:14.720]   we feel when faced with cognitive dissonance and so we are always going to tend and trend
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:23.400]   to try to focus in on stories and news and ideas that agree with the ones that we have
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:30.800]   and we're seeing now the more studies are showing that a an opinion or even facts that
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:36.320]   are in direct conflict with yours so there's like half steps and those are fine but if they're
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:43.640]   in direct conflict with yours it can solidify your point of view even more we like it yes
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:49.480]   maybe it's the future but we've just like we're built for this and so that's what I
[00:19:49.480 --> 00:19:55.040]   think ends up being the bigger issue overall is like trying to find a way to combat that
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:20:00.680]   problem but this is a tech show and not like a psychology show so that's the challenge
[00:20:00.680 --> 00:20:04.760]   is that it all overlaps you know it's also we're not a politics show but some of the
[00:20:04.760 --> 00:20:08.920]   stuff that we'll have to talk about today but that involved Facebook has to do with politics
[00:20:08.920 --> 00:20:13.560]   it's just all so overlapping right now it's kind of impossible to avoid it but yeah there's
[00:20:13.560 --> 00:20:20.440]   that that kind of like human need to seek out the thing that or to be drawn to the thing
[00:20:20.440 --> 00:20:27.880]   that that confirms our own beliefs and that's exactly what these what these platforms have
[00:20:27.880 --> 00:20:33.400]   have benefited from because they and created their services around to to tailored absolutely
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:37.480]   because if you're going to get the clicks if you're going to get the engagement if you're going
[00:20:37.480 --> 00:20:41.480]   to get the things that you get to show to your stockholders or your shareholders
[00:20:42.440 --> 00:20:46.840]   look our platform is doing well then there's the built-in need to make sure that those
[00:20:46.840 --> 00:20:51.000]   clicks and things are happening and that's you know YouTube has been criticized for that where they
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.160]   gotta give them credit and making business decisions yeah and that's that's what it is
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:59.800]   they're a business they're they're not people as what some people want to assume they are they are
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:04.360]   a business when they're going to make business decisions that can sometimes feel pretty gut
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:09.320]   wrenching to us now part of this is that Facebook is working at least right now with to what they
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:15.240]   say around 200 trusted air quotes trusted publishers Washington Post Wall Street Journal
[00:21:15.240 --> 00:21:21.960]   NBC News ABC News just name a few oh and Breitbart many are pushing back on that last part to say
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:29.640]   hey by the way trusted publishers Breitbart has in the past definitely in you know embedded itself
[00:21:29.640 --> 00:21:36.680]   as being at least a some degree a news organization or whatever you want to call it that tailors to
[00:21:37.320 --> 00:21:43.240]   the far right and in doing so has yes some some of those headlines have been kind of
[00:21:43.240 --> 00:21:47.400]   have been hateful when you when you look through that list of people that they have
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:52.840]   allegedly you know been in talks with and looks like it's going to work for them does that make you
[00:21:52.840 --> 00:21:57.640]   look differently at them do you does that make you look differently at the Wall Street Journal as a
[00:21:57.640 --> 00:22:04.680]   source oh because they're in with these other groups right no um well and I know you didn't ask
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:07.640]   me kind of as Jason but yeah I was looking at you I was looking at you
[00:22:07.640 --> 00:22:16.120]   yeah Jason how do you look at them differently I don't look at I don't look at the Wall Street
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:19.640]   Journal or the Washington Post differently because Breitbart's there is that what you're asking
[00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:24.760]   or just in general because these books are actually going in co-hoots with Facebook instead of just
[00:22:24.760 --> 00:22:31.000]   trying to write it out themselves as they're all you know no I I don't blame them for wondering
[00:22:31.000 --> 00:22:36.840]   because I think you know the state of of news and and you know the money that yeah they still got
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:42.040]   to get paid they still got to eat paid and it's almost well it's pretty undeniable that Facebook
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:47.240]   has an insane amount of users right and it's so business decision if yeah it's a business decision
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:53.560]   right like if there is a platform that that puts your content in front of billions of of users right
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:23:00.040]   you just but you know how you just know how boycott heavy our society is now so that's that's why I
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:05.160]   asked oh my gosh they're in co-hoots with Facebook I'm done with them I'm never buying that subscription
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:09.720]   ever again oh I mean I'm sure they were in co-hoots with Facebook on the last thing that
[00:23:09.720 --> 00:23:16.200]   and Facebook has a new thing and so they'll try it again and we'll see how it goes this time right
[00:23:16.200 --> 00:23:21.720]   I don't fault them for that no because I think at the end of the day we have these if we have
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:27.960]   publications that are genuinely trying to do their best to speak as they say truth to power as is the
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:36.840]   journalist's way I don't within certain bounds obviously I don't mind if you are trying every way
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:42.600]   to make sure that you're able to pay your journalists the their fair wage and make sure they have health
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:48.200]   insurance and things like that and if that includes making sure that this place where people are
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:53.160]   putting so much of their focus is a place where you are and that you can get money through that I
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:24:01.080]   think that's great in particular because right now like I said this with Facebook being a place to
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:08.680]   get these headlines that really get people focused but are not true and or are you know filled with
[00:24:08.680 --> 00:24:14.760]   with errors then let's get some really good publications in there that are speaking truth and
[00:24:14.760 --> 00:24:23.480]   and being able to be there and sort of dilute right the pollution as it were right anything would
[00:24:23.480 --> 00:24:28.280]   help is what you're saying yeah please anything would help sorry I'm the simpleton of the group
[00:24:28.280 --> 00:24:37.320]   so I guess we'll see this this just launched today and who the heck knows how this is going to
[00:24:37.320 --> 00:24:43.960]   to play out whether it's even going to be useful like I don't even you know I was looking over my
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:48.600]   wife was showing me something on Facebook I don't have a Facebook account and so I was looking over
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:53.480]   her shoulder as she was showing it to me I was like whoa the app is updated like I'm so clued out
[00:24:53.480 --> 00:24:57.880]   on Facebook at this point because I don't use them on a regular basis right they really changed the
[00:24:57.880 --> 00:25:01.800]   look and feel of this app so who knows maybe they will position this in a different way
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:09.400]   on the new design that people will actually use it and entice you to no I just you know what the
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:14.760]   only thing that you know only thing that entices me is that there is at least one to two Facebook
[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:20.920]   groups that I can't participate in that I would like to participate in yeah and so then I'm like
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:26.200]   okay well then does that mean that I have to create a an account an identity and Facebook in order
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:29.880]   to participate in these groups and you know it kind of goes back to what we were saying earlier
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:34.840]   like like part of me is just like no I'm not gonna do that I'm done I don't want that to be the
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:39.880]   reason that I sign up for an account right the other thing that I think is always important to note
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:48.360]   as as I think we can all sometimes forget as I forget all the time is that these companies are
[00:25:48.360 --> 00:25:53.480]   not it's it's not as if everybody who works at the company is all working on the same thing at the
[00:25:53.480 --> 00:25:59.400]   same time right so Facebook has an inside there's a news company or there's a there's a news team
[00:25:59.400 --> 00:26:04.600]   within the company that has probably been working on this feature for a long time and it's just now
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:09.080]   rolled out yeah we're on Twitter launches a new feature then everybody's like but how come you
[00:26:09.080 --> 00:26:13.400]   haven't done this yet yeah come you haven't done this yet and it's like well it's not as if all
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:17.160]   of Twitter just suddenly goes well and they focus on the next thing and then that's done you've got
[00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:21.800]   a bunch of different teams working inside and so the team at Facebook that was in charge to in
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:28.040]   charge of creating this feature finished it and it's out there regardless of the timeline of what's
[00:26:28.040 --> 00:26:35.080]   going on around it I see what you did there including Zuckerberg timeline speaking speaking
[00:26:35.080 --> 00:26:42.280]   in front of Congress yet again that's right that did happen uh which I wanted to say you know tell
[00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:47.240]   me if you've heard it before our Facebook CEO goes to Congress to sneak in front of blowblock
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:51.240]   I feel like this year we've you mean yesterday or the day before yesterday yeah four times
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:58.840]   and who the heck knows what actually comes out of it when this seems to happen but um but apparently
[00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:05.000]   this time things were interesting Zuck really was uh just kind of flustered at times unable to
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:12.120]   answer some questions obviously the topic of of Libra was of big importance at this this was a
[00:27:12.120 --> 00:27:18.520]   huge reason for this particular meeting and uh you know Zuckerberg admitted Facebook might not be
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:23.800]   the right messenger of such an effort right kind of admitted that you know maybe Facebook wouldn't
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:30.520]   be involved in this in the end but I really think it needs to happen yeah I I went through that
[00:27:30.520 --> 00:27:36.280]   article and the first thing it jumped out to me is it seemed like Miss Waters was a little bit unfair
[00:27:36.280 --> 00:27:42.680]   and in her attacks of them uh the way she discussed the growth of Facebook and all of its users and
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:49.640]   acting as if they were above the law um Facebook wasn't forced on any of us it's not their fault that
[00:27:49.640 --> 00:27:55.080]   they you know just grew to a gazillion users they put a product out there that people enjoy and
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:28:00.520]   and and love to share it with other people so they grew organically you know so it's
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:06.200]   you got to give him credit for that don't vilify him for putting a product out there that people
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:14.680]   actually like at one point in time right yeah I so I don't know what her uh you're talking about
[00:28:14.680 --> 00:28:19.160]   Maxine Waters right yeah I'm not sure what her and what I didn't know what her I didn't know what
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:26.920]   her gender was on that um but she tends to be pretty pretty loud yeah she's she's kind of jumping
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:30.680]   on to the antitrust calls that we're hearing you know around Facebook and then of course around
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:35.640]   Google and I'm breaking up the you know breaking up tech and so forth and I'm like well I mean this
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:40.600]   is he and he's he they're big because they made a product that people chose to sign up for
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:45.160]   they what they didn't force it on anybody I mean we're gonna hear this this drumbeat
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:51.640]   pounded heavily with Elizabeth Warren you know she's she's out very outspoken on this as well yeah
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:57.080]   yeah and I got my beef with her too but everyone thinks I'm off my rocker when I say so because she
[00:28:57.080 --> 00:29:05.960]   has a gazillion followers on on Facebook and in his campaigning and talking a whole lot of smack
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:11.080]   against these tech companies and she's still using these tech companies as part of the campaign
[00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:18.600]   yeah you know so is that hypocritical or do I have a different definition for that word you know
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:26.920]   right uh yeah so I'm trying to think of um other other things that have been broken up in
[00:29:26.920 --> 00:29:34.600]   regulated by um by the government that worked well so the you know major phone
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:43.640]   companies are within certain within certain bounds not allowed to be monopolies and that
[00:29:43.640 --> 00:29:51.000]   has resulted in over time lower prices competition competition and things like that and so I don't
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:57.800]   think that there has to be anything inherently wrong with breaking up um big companies regardless
[00:29:57.800 --> 00:30:02.520]   of whether they've been helpful and whether we choose to sign up for them I think that's a separate
[00:30:02.520 --> 00:30:09.880]   that is a separate observation just because we made the choice to sign up for it and like they've
[00:30:09.880 --> 00:30:16.680]   gone and been able to grow the company to a big thing we could say the same about um Bell and AT&T
[00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:21.480]   and then everybody right now would be using AT&T and AT&T would be in charge of how much we'd be
[00:30:21.480 --> 00:30:27.080]   paying for our advices so it's good that that was not allowed to become a monopoly and that that
[00:30:27.080 --> 00:30:33.960]   was broken up over time um so I think that you know there are places where regulation makes sense
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:39.320]   and I think that's kind of going to be as we're going into things the way that we have to to pay
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:45.160]   attention to the differences and in the the policies there uh but what we're talking about right now I
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:53.880]   think speaks to the conversation overall he Zuckerberg went to Congress to talk about cryptocurrency
[00:30:53.880 --> 00:31:00.680]   and every time Zuckerberg goes to Congress it turns in into so many other conversations
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:06.600]   right it does they have access to grind they do they do yeah everybody has access to grind and
[00:31:07.240 --> 00:31:21.160]   what I find fascinating is watching our frankly uh in many cases aged politicians um under statement
[00:31:21.160 --> 00:31:27.320]   is learning as they go along where the first time Zuck went to Congress they were basically asking
[00:31:27.320 --> 00:31:32.920]   for tech support during the during the hearing yeah they were but as they're going along these uh
[00:31:32.920 --> 00:31:36.200]   the points that they're trying to get across the conversations they're trying to have are
[00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:40.840]   improving but what this to me they're learning they're learning how to use
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:47.320]   what this to me speaks to is that we need to do a better job of just having tech policy officials
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:52.120]   in place that know this stuff because it's clearly something that that you know is worth having a
[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:56.600]   conversation with but we can't just wait for a hearing to make the stuff happen and to question
[00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:02.520]   these things I guess is kind of where I come from it uh and and so the fact that like you got to
[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:06.600]   have another thing that Facebook's doing to have this public hearing before you can have these
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:13.480]   conversations these are things that I think should be just part of the the conversation of the
[00:32:13.480 --> 00:32:17.800]   government in the first place yeah I think what's interesting about what you're talking about kind
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:22.680]   of like the generational you know kind of part of what I what I pulled out of that is like this
[00:32:22.680 --> 00:32:31.080]   generational gap between kind of the older the the older uh what guard in in Congress or in
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:36.040]   government and then the younger guard in in in government right now AOC at one point
[00:32:36.040 --> 00:32:43.320]   asked whether Facebook would take down an ad that was filled with lies or you know filled with
[00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:50.120]   untruths what however you wanted to call that i.e. would Facebook actually fact check political ads
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:58.040]   and specifically in her question to Zuckerberg mentioned an ad a fictional ad in which a geo
[00:32:58.040 --> 00:33:05.880]   peak primary uh you know basically a republican candidate supports the new uh the new green deal
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:11.160]   oh yeah just using that as a theoretical example because that's not happening right right and
[00:33:11.160 --> 00:33:17.240]   and kind of kind of put Zuckerberg in a point in a position to like yes or no like would you
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:22.680]   fact check that if you know that's that's that's false like would you allow me to to uh to post
[00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:28.600]   that if I tried aka would you take money for this this false ad right and Zuck would not you know
[00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:33.720]   he stumbled a lot he would not answer either he didn't answer yeah and so because it was a yes
[00:33:33.720 --> 00:33:38.840]   no question and she kept in kept trying the videos interesting like you practically hear the sweat
[00:33:38.840 --> 00:33:46.360]   building uh and then so a man named Adriel I believe it's a man anyways Adriel uh hampton created an ad
[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:53.240]   exactly that does this like yesterday created this ad and put together an ad pulling out clips of
[00:33:53.240 --> 00:33:58.840]   Lindsey Graham whatever and crafting it and it's down actually it's not this video if you scroll down
[00:33:58.840 --> 00:34:06.600]   uh it's the video below that and put together a very convincing yeah keep going uh very convincing
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:13.160]   looking ad and uh sure enough was able to you know run it on the facebook platform conservatives
[00:34:13.160 --> 00:34:19.800]   for a green new deal right oh my god totally created the ad that she used as a hypothetical
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:23.560]   and in it you know Lindsey Graham is is there saying and I think they probably took him out of
[00:34:23.560 --> 00:34:29.240]   context right you know of course but saying like I fully support the the green new deal and fellow
[00:34:29.240 --> 00:34:35.800]   republicans should get in on this good on them purely to kind of try and see like would is this
[00:34:35.800 --> 00:34:40.520]   possible and of course you know submitted uh as an ad it was approved overnight it got a
[00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:45.320]   plural questions it went out you know I think it was a small ad buy I think it went out to like
[00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:51.160]   a thousand people uh but anyways it just kind of proved her point it's like okay so anybody can
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:56.520]   make anything and make it an ad and that see the I think that the the point of that question and
[00:34:56.520 --> 00:35:03.480]   the the bigger conversation overall there is that facebook has said that they are going to that
[00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:08.680]   they were going to do a better job with political advertising that they were going to better police
[00:35:08.680 --> 00:35:13.400]   those accounts and make sure that they're for you where your mouth is facebook right and so
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:19.160]   to be able to do this still that is that is concerning I will speak to though the only reason
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:25.480]   that I was able to see um how long those ads of me had been running was because of facebook's
[00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:35.800]   changes to uh better show users how the ad system works and so now there's this sort of um any any
[00:35:35.800 --> 00:35:43.480]   page or account that serves ads you can go in and uh audit their timeline basically they're
[00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:48.120]   their timeline of advertising and so you go to this little special section and it shows
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:54.840]   every single ad they've ever run uh how long it ran you do have to dig a little bit but I like
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:35:58.600]   that that feature is there like I have to give facebook some credit for actually updating that
[00:35:58.600 --> 00:36:02.520]   because in the past it was just all hidden behind and there was no way to know that right yeah they
[00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:07.800]   never wanted you to know that stuff now that they had a force to having to to reveal yeah yeah
[00:36:07.800 --> 00:36:15.400]   uh we should probably move on from facebook right please thank you but first I am very excited
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:21.240]   about this we have a new sponsor here on the network and uh for this week in tech and that's
[00:36:21.240 --> 00:36:28.200]   privacy.com you don't use the same password everywhere or at least you shouldn't be let's let's uh get
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:34.040]   that fixed you shouldn't be so why use the same card number when you shop online with privacy.com
[00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:39.640]   you get a brand new virtual visa or master card card number for every purchase you make online
[00:36:39.640 --> 00:36:48.680]   with just one click folks I have been using privacy.com for I don't know like two three years now and it
[00:36:48.680 --> 00:36:56.920]   is genuinely so helpful in in all aspects of of keeping yourself safe of uh making sure that you've
[00:36:56.920 --> 00:37:04.600]   got your different subscription services on lock it is fantastic so you go online and say you want to
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:09.880]   set up a new Netflix subscription you go on a privacy with one click you can create a card
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:14.600]   and it gives you a number for that card it gives you all the information in your date your security
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:23.960]   code all that jazz and it will uh let you lock a specific vendor to that card so I go to Netflix
[00:37:23.960 --> 00:37:29.160]   I type in those card numbers and you know all the other information and I set up a subscription
[00:37:29.160 --> 00:37:35.160]   for Netflix when I hop back to privacy the card actually changes it becomes a Netflix card and only
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:41.080]   Netflix can use that card number to make those purchases but it goes even further it allows you
[00:37:41.080 --> 00:37:47.320]   not only to do that but to set it up so that only a certain amount of money is charged onto the card
[00:37:48.200 --> 00:37:54.200]   that it only gets to charge so much per month it's very very detailed on how it's set up and so
[00:37:54.200 --> 00:37:58.200]   that way you never get overcharged for your subscriptions when you want to cancel them sometimes
[00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:03.320]   there are those uh horrible subscription services I have to say where you go and the only way to
[00:38:03.320 --> 00:38:07.240]   cancel them is if you call the people and they give you this whole thing oh we'll give it to you
[00:38:07.240 --> 00:38:11.640]   for half off this that and the other well that's because they have your card number right and
[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:17.320]   they're charging you every month for it regardless of whether you call to cancel with privacy.com
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:21.720]   you just cancel that card they can't charge you anymore so you don't have to go through the rig
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:26.760]   and roll of trying to get that thing canceled that's why I love privacy and like I said that ability
[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:31.800]   to go through and see very easily okay this is how much money I've spent this month and this is what
[00:38:31.800 --> 00:38:37.560]   it's been for Netflix for Spotify for Apple music because I'm a fool and have both for some reason
[00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:42.520]   all of these uh easily show up and I can keep track of those things and hey if it's time to get rid
[00:38:42.520 --> 00:38:47.560]   of a subscription because there are way too many subscriptions out there then privacy makes it easy
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:53.000]   to do that as well so you never have to worry about being built twice or having some upgrades go
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:59.320]   through without your consent and it makes it super easy to cancel subscriptions and at the end of
[00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:04.440]   a free trial not having to worry about being charged ever again now refunds work even if the
[00:39:04.440 --> 00:39:08.280]   card is closed or paused so you can go through and pause any card that you want to or if you're
[00:39:08.280 --> 00:39:12.760]   done with that completely then you can close out the card but refunds are still going to get back to
[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:20.200]   you and here is what rocks the security of your data is at the core of what privacy does so your
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:24.520]   virtual cards are locked to a merchant like I mentioned so you don't need to worry about changing
[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:28.520]   your card if your card ever your card number gets stolen or something like that you don't need to
[00:39:28.520 --> 00:39:32.920]   worry about that because it's just that one card and it's locked that merchant so even if someone
[00:39:32.920 --> 00:39:37.240]   finds that card number and tries to use it and they're not Netflix they're not going to get it it's
[00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:41.960]   fantastic that's pretty slick so slick you'll get a decline email or a push notification of a
[00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:47.080]   hacker tries to use the card elsewhere they're also PCI DSS compliant I gotta say I don't know
[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:52.760]   what PCI DSS means but it sounds important and are held to the same security standards as your bank
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:57.400]   so there you go they're held to the same security standards as that bank for your debit card the
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:01.960]   sensitive information is secured using military grade encryption and information is encrypted
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:08.680]   using split key encryption with partial keys held by separate employees that again is very important
[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:14.760]   that those those encryption are not located in the same place so you know all that awesome privacy
[00:40:14.760 --> 00:40:20.360]   and security jazz privacy has that covered for you now currently on their free personal plan you can
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:26.360]   create up to 12 cards a month they're again secure merchant locked and single use cards which everyone
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:32.920]   you'd like to do and now privacy has launched two paid versions both pro and teams for pro cost
[00:40:32.920 --> 00:40:37.880]   10 bucks a month you get access to everything that is included in the free personal plan plus

[00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:54.520]   bucks a month that gets you access to everything included in the pro version plus a dedicated account
[00:40:54.520 --> 00:41:02.360]   manager access to 60 cards a month and transaction limits tailored to your business needs so regardless
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:06.200]   of whether you want to do the free the pro or the team version you're going to get more features
[00:41:06.200 --> 00:41:11.800]   there if you need them but 12 cards a month so you can have the ones that you go to every every
[00:41:11.800 --> 00:41:17.160]   time you know your Netflix you're spotify but there are one time cards they like burner cards where
[00:41:17.160 --> 00:41:22.040]   maybe you want to sign up for a newspaper subscription and you just want to pay that first month of
[00:41:22.040 --> 00:41:27.160]   prices and after that first charge goes through on the card it immediately gets canceled kicked
[00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:33.160]   away you don't have to worry about it anymore that is I seriously I know this looks like I'm
[00:41:33.160 --> 00:41:37.720]   over hyping it but I really do love privacy it's fantastic before they were ever a sponsor
[00:41:37.720 --> 00:41:40.680]   I heard they were going to be a sponsor on the network and I was like yes I have to talk about
[00:41:40.680 --> 00:41:45.640]   them privacy believes customers should have full control of their data so they provide their
[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:51.960]   customers access to transaction data via a webhook API so if you're a smart developer you can
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:57.640]   get in there and get API-ing of course also have two factor authentication which is so important
[00:41:57.640 --> 00:42:03.240]   yep yep so protect your privacy and your money with virtual cards from privacy.com I'm serious go

[00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:27.640]   episode of Twit and for keeping me in line with all of my doggone subscriptions I appreciate it.
[00:42:27.640 --> 00:42:32.120]   How many subscriptions do you have? I don't want to talk about it. No we need to know I can
[00:42:32.120 --> 00:42:36.600]   please the bottom of this on the grounds that I might incriminate myself. Oh man.
[00:42:36.600 --> 00:42:45.080]   So I got a box earlier today do I talk about that? Yes you got a box. Yeah I learned how to box.
[00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:50.840]   Yeah let me add one hand. So the other day I got a box and it was actually a nest mini.
[00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:55.880]   You were super excited to get that nest mini too. It was on this weekend Google. I was a little
[00:42:55.880 --> 00:43:00.520]   disappointed I'll be honest because I thought it might be the Pixel 4 XL that I was waiting for
[00:43:00.520 --> 00:43:10.360]   and what do you know that came to me? Now I know you're precious. I know that last week on the show
[00:43:10.360 --> 00:43:18.360]   or just Sunday for the hard sign on had her Pixel 4 to show off and everything so this is not new
[00:43:18.360 --> 00:43:24.440]   news for the Twit panel but it's okay to brag that you get your picks before.
[00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:30.360]   Right and I'm asking you a great battery life because it's the XL. Yes okay so at least it's got
[00:43:30.360 --> 00:43:34.920]   a larger battery life but I thought we could kind of touch a little bit on kind of a little bit of
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:39.400]   a roundup of some of the reviews that we have heard because Florence you know she had spent
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:44.120]   I don't know how many days she probably had it like five days or whatever and she gave a kind of a
[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:49.880]   good rundown. Now we're starting to hear what everybody else thinks and now that I've got it
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:54.280]   I can put it to the test. I'm a little concerned about some of the some of the aspects of this
[00:43:54.280 --> 00:44:00.040]   and actually Micah you know you're gonna be using this phone here pretty soon. I am at some point
[00:44:00.040 --> 00:44:05.640]   we're gonna do the switch. Oh that's right. Yes wait I didn't realize we're actually switching
[00:44:05.640 --> 00:44:12.360]   the devices that we use. That's that's the point of the switch. Oh my god. That's what this is what
[00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:17.240]   you agreed to. I gotta get a case for my midnight green phone so you don't break it. Oh my gosh.
[00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:23.160]   Yes please do that. Oh no. Oh god. Where's my baby? Did you want to take it?
[00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:28.600]   Don't worry. We're not doing it yet. Where's my baby? We've got we can and we can hammer out the
[00:44:28.600 --> 00:44:35.240]   details. It doesn't have to be a bad thing. All right so it sounds like from what the reviews
[00:44:35.240 --> 00:44:39.480]   and I don't know you know I didn't I didn't prep for it over the shoulder shot so my apologies that
[00:44:39.480 --> 00:44:45.800]   I didn't do that. Looks good. We can do that. Sounds like some of the some of the reviews a lot of them
[00:44:45.800 --> 00:44:50.360]   are kind of on similar footing on a lot of these points. The memory the six gigs of memory and
[00:44:50.360 --> 00:44:55.720]   performance is great. Clean delivery of the software everything and everything looks like
[00:44:55.720 --> 00:45:00.920]   you know really smooth and nice. Is it a jingle launcher? This is the pixel launcher. This is the
[00:45:00.920 --> 00:45:05.800]   stock launcher. Yep that's how it looks. You got your kind of new screen over there. Is that your
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:10.280]   typical launcher that you like on your devices? Yeah if I'm using a pixel I've got kind of the
[00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:16.440]   stock launcher going and I don't I don't tend to change that. The design like so this was like
[00:45:16.440 --> 00:45:21.960]   pulling it out of the box was my first exposure to the phone. I got to say I really like this like
[00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:28.920]   matte glass approach. Micah's gonna pod it a little bit. So is this what is this rubberized or plastic
[00:45:28.920 --> 00:45:34.040]   or what's this around the outside? I'm in the black part. The black part. Do you know what material is?
[00:45:34.040 --> 00:45:40.120]   Yeah I think it's aluminum around the edges and glass on the front and back. Oh that feels really nice.
[00:45:40.120 --> 00:45:43.720]   What's interesting is the aluminum and the glass kind of feel very similar so they do.
[00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:47.640]   You've done some really interesting texturizing. This is the panda model right?
[00:45:47.640 --> 00:45:52.120]   You should do a little less slippery with that you know. Yeah I think that's...
[00:45:52.120 --> 00:45:56.120]   Not being as glossy as you know. I don't know. I don't have brand new really. You just feel really...
[00:45:56.120 --> 00:46:01.640]   Just wanted to know what it tasted like. Come on. Don't don't don't taste my phone.
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:07.080]   Yeah for the listeners out there who are not watching I pretended to lick the device.
[00:46:07.080 --> 00:46:14.440]   Acting? Have you activated the radar and face unlock on it? Okay so the face unlock is pretty
[00:46:14.440 --> 00:46:20.120]   fast I have to say so I'm gonna hold it up and at that time it wasn't that much. No that was pretty
[00:46:20.120 --> 00:46:25.880]   average there brother. That was pretty average. It knows it's got some stage fright. Yeah that's
[00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:33.320]   pretty average too. Oh it didn't even do it that time. Oh boy. Well don't worry. Come on. There we go.
[00:46:33.320 --> 00:46:38.920]   Don't worry. I froze an iPad on air so it's not a surprise. Well you know it's not me that's
[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:43.480]   failing it's the phone so thankfully there's that. I do think the display looks really nice.
[00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:47.880]   You know it's got the 90 Hertz everybody's calling that out. Speakers allowed clear apparently.
[00:46:47.880 --> 00:46:51.880]   Assistant upgrades. I haven't had any time to play around with that but people say they're
[00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:57.560]   notable. I gotta say when I hear people talk about the speakers on this phone or any smartphone
[00:46:57.560 --> 00:47:03.720]   I'm like just stop. No I do this all the time. There people do this aunt. There's smartphone
[00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:09.240]   speakers they're not going to sound good. Unless you put it in a bowl or something. No that's okay.
[00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:13.480]   They're not going to sound good. They don't really sound great but to pump out the sound. A lot of
[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:17.880]   people will just listen to stuff from their phone. Yeah but these will never sound as good as
[00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:23.560]   larger speakers but within themselves there is a continuum between bad and good. You read the
[00:47:23.560 --> 00:47:28.600]   reviews and people are like how do speakers don't sound all that great. I think you're expecting
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:34.760]   right. They're never going to sound like big. How are they going to sound good because okay I'll go
[00:47:34.760 --> 00:47:39.320]   ahead and put. So you're playing devil's advocate and taking up for it. I'm not buying it. No I'll
[00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:46.120]   go ahead and bring in the Walmart on 10.1 inch tablet and I'll play some music from those speakers
[00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:52.120]   and you will understand what that is. Okay all right there. No that sounded like a greeting card.
[00:47:52.120 --> 00:47:59.160]   Oh my god. Oh man okay at least this you can hear us a certain greeting card. All right.
[00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:05.000]   So I have not played around with solely. I'm afraid to test it out. The reviews seem to be saying
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:12.280]   on average that it's just not always reliable. Yeah underutilized. Supposedly it speeds up face
[00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:18.680]   unlocked but we just put a lot of that a few minutes ago. Right right. Yeah and then I think
[00:48:18.680 --> 00:48:23.000]   the big downside and the thing that I'm worried about is battery and actually maybe not on the
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:27.160]   pixel on the the excel because the excel is going to better. Right. That's what I've been seeing is
[00:48:27.160 --> 00:48:31.560]   that folks who got the smaller one were really complaining about battery life but the folks who've
[00:48:31.560 --> 00:48:36.200]   gotten the bigger one among them. I'm just I follow they were okay with it. I'm just concerned one
[00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:41.320]   these days I'm going to walk into the office and he's going to be at his desk doing this. What is he
[00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:45.880]   turning up all you on stuff. Yeah what is he doing over there. Speeding forward though.
[00:48:45.880 --> 00:48:50.440]   Oh the the celery. Yeah sure. That's because you're getting one here in a few weeks. I'm not
[00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:56.920]   sure when yours is still a ring but all. You have made a mistake. We I have. Yeah. What did I do?
[00:48:56.920 --> 00:49:03.080]   Well so we hung out last time we did went to PEPCOM in San Francisco. Yeah and Shannon Morse
[00:49:03.080 --> 00:49:07.080]   showed me her pixel for I can't remember if it was the excel. She had the excel.
[00:49:07.080 --> 00:49:13.320]   If the pixel for excel and it had a Pokemon wallpaper that when you wiped when you
[00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:17.400]   swiped your hand across the front of it then the Pokemon would do some sort of interaction.
[00:49:17.400 --> 00:49:23.560]   Oh and so your screen doesn't have that and that's something going on in the background right now.
[00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:28.200]   Yeah there is a live wallpaper. I don't know that it's activated at all.
[00:49:28.200 --> 00:49:33.960]   Here we'll set this up because I think if I remember correctly it ships on the phone by default.
[00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:40.120]   What did the Pokemon company so I'm pretty sure I'm just going to put a Tiger Paul in mind and call
[00:49:40.120 --> 00:49:45.480]   it a day. That's so boring. You should get a Tiger Paul that moves when you swipe across the screen.
[00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:51.240]   Okay maybe I will look for that. Yeah probably have to have to install. Pokemon pixel for
[00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:55.480]   this type of style. So Clemson folks if y'all have a nice Clemson wallpaper that would look good on
[00:49:55.480 --> 00:50:01.960]   this hit me up please. Thank you. Google's the first thing you do with the difference. Excellent.
[00:50:01.960 --> 00:50:05.240]   Okay it's called Pokemon Wave Hello is the app. Oh right okay.
[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:11.560]   All right well I don't have any. I'm going to risk you so quickly man. Whoa already.
[00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:17.240]   It's a machine. Yes all right well I'll install that and see I don't know if I'll get to it in
[00:50:17.240 --> 00:50:23.960]   time but we'll certainly see. Oh no we're waiting. I'm scared. You don't understand. Last week or
[00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:29.000]   on Sunday I keep forgetting it's has not been a full week since the last episode. I believe
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:35.320]   the panel talked about the face unlock with the eyes closed. Google has since said that they're
[00:50:35.320 --> 00:50:39.720]   going to do a fix on that and they're going to talk about it on security now as well.
[00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:43.640]   Yeah I'm not sure when that's going to happen. Okay so I installed it that was fast. It was
[00:50:43.640 --> 00:50:48.760]   really cool. Okay so if you want to show it you can and we can see what this is all about.
[00:50:48.760 --> 00:50:54.760]   Pokemon with gestures apparently. Quick gestures use gestures above the phone to play with
[00:50:54.760 --> 00:50:59.640]   Pokemon characters. Okay so something like that. Oh it detected it. Okay we'll start.
[00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:05.000]   This is why I don't get to hang with the cool kids. Yeah you don't get to do this.
[00:51:05.000 --> 00:51:12.520]   I'm not going to do that. Oh my goodness. I just. It's Pikachu. Oh my gosh. You are obviously
[00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:20.040]   of the Pokemon generation. I am firmly. Yes. Okay so I want to say. That was good. Oh look at that.
[00:51:20.040 --> 00:51:28.440]   Well it said Pikachu on the screen. Oh gosh. Face. Oh my okay. All right.
[00:51:28.440 --> 00:51:31.400]   A little heart. So you trained it. That's what that was doing. Is that what I did?
[00:51:31.400 --> 00:51:36.440]   Basically training the. A little bit of training. Okay. Or more just like loving your little
[00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:41.640]   loving your little pal. Okay all right. It is kind of weird though to like stop. Like why
[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:45.800]   does it have to be out here? I just kind of want to go wrong. Oh right. Yeah that's a good point.
[00:51:45.800 --> 00:51:50.600]   Why? I don't know. But anyways all right so this is neat I suppose. This is an example of the
[00:51:50.600 --> 00:51:56.520]   solely radar that is up here. I mean I do like the aspect of having a Jedi phone but I'm not
[00:51:56.520 --> 00:51:59.560]   doing it. It's just that it gets to be your wallpaper. I think that's the cool part. So it
[00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:03.320]   can serve as a live wallpaper and so when you pull up your phone it'll do a little bit of thing but
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:10.280]   then you could easily wipe over and then it'll interact. So she had Evie and Pikachu as her
[00:52:10.280 --> 00:52:14.680]   background. Okay all right well I don't think that that was installed with the app.
[00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:19.720]   No that's just something that you know Shannon's got the yeah she's got the magic. She's got the
[00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:26.760]   pixel 4 XL edge. That's what it is. The chromium version. I'll be honest I'll be honest I'm excited
[00:52:26.760 --> 00:52:32.120]   about the phone but I'm only excited about the camera. I don't wait you what you were excited
[00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:37.880]   about cameras that doesn't that's very sad. That's about it the camera. So what is the thing
[00:52:37.880 --> 00:52:42.760]   we want to test on? I just want to put it on a tripod and do some astro stuff. Okay.
[00:52:42.760 --> 00:52:50.200]   You know because just just to see what it's like and also to help prove that it does take a little
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:54.360]   bit of effort to get that stuff right. Yeah you know because everybody is sort of assuming you can
[00:52:54.360 --> 00:53:00.760]   just just hold it up to the sky and boom it's done. I know it's not quite like that all the time.
[00:53:00.760 --> 00:53:05.240]   What's the astro stuff you're talking about? It'll shoot long exposures of the sky at night to
[00:53:05.240 --> 00:53:09.720]   let you see the Milky Way but again you need to have your camera still. You know if you got a
[00:53:09.720 --> 00:53:15.080]   little mount put it up there hit the button step back. How long does it shoot for 30 seconds? I think
[00:53:15.080 --> 00:53:20.280]   Kevin Tofol shot his for a little for longer than 30 seconds when he shot it and it worked
[00:53:20.280 --> 00:53:25.000]   really really well. Oh did it look cool. Where did you see this? Is this online somewhere?
[00:53:25.000 --> 00:53:29.720]   He was on this week in Google but he may have it on about chromebooks.com
[00:53:29.720 --> 00:53:36.040]   but it was it was pretty fascinating but the rest of the stuff Android 10 um
[00:53:36.840 --> 00:53:43.400]   I already got it. Yeah and it works and doesn't do all that it works. You know that's all I need.
[00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:48.520]   You know you doing this crazy wallpaper stuff I can care less. I just need to I need the phone
[00:53:48.520 --> 00:53:54.360]   to work far as handling messages which is another mystery with Google and handling phone calls.
[00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:58.520]   You talk about that. Yeah please because I've seen some things about that. Right and then
[00:53:58.520 --> 00:54:04.680]   taking some beautiful photographs. Now granted some of the testing like the side by side between the
[00:54:04.680 --> 00:54:11.960]   11 pro max is that what you call it versus the pixel. A lot of the stuff on the iPhone looks
[00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:16.840]   looks better. Yeah this generation iPhone especially when you're talking about the low light stuff.
[00:54:16.840 --> 00:54:22.120]   There's actually in the in the rundown an article on Macworld Michael Simon did kind of a
[00:54:22.120 --> 00:54:29.960]   iPhone 11 versus pixel 4 night sight low light kind of shoot out and at least in the pictures that
[00:54:29.960 --> 00:54:36.760]   are posted in this article the iPhone 11 is solid in most of this stuff whereas the pixel 4 in some
[00:54:36.760 --> 00:54:42.280]   some instances kind of just looks a little bit too blown out. Right. Almost like it's it's brightening
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:48.120]   maybe a little bit too much in some areas uh but the you know and some of them actually are very
[00:54:48.120 --> 00:54:56.280]   comparable but um yeah I wondered how long apple was just going to allow Google to be the reigning
[00:54:56.280 --> 00:55:01.720]   you know yeah and the night stuff yeah the night stuff I knew that wasn't I knew that wasn't a
[00:55:01.720 --> 00:55:05.640]   fight that apple was just gonna be like well I guess I guess they've gotten us at that. I think
[00:55:05.640 --> 00:55:09.720]   you're glad they're competing. It's just transcribing everything you're saying. Oh great. Oh yeah your
[00:55:09.720 --> 00:55:16.040]   phone's listening to you. That's handy. Totally uh totally secure. I'm glad apple jumped in with
[00:55:16.040 --> 00:55:21.960]   this with this race and what is it called? The diffusion? Diffusion. Yeah I'm glad to jump in. Otherwise
[00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:28.360]   known as sweater mode. Sweater mode that's right. I'm glad they jumped in because now they can
[00:55:28.360 --> 00:55:33.880]   continue to push Google to to get to get better with this each and every you know iteration of it.
[00:55:33.880 --> 00:55:40.120]   For sure. For sure. In Grand and I know most people they just want to just tap it and shoot and you
[00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:45.560]   know make it look good. Yeah you you want it. Please let it just work. Let it just work. Let it just
[00:55:45.560 --> 00:55:50.920]   work. Sometimes you want to spare it to me. No I do. I do want to play around. Yeah take some photos
[00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:56.920]   from some different angles and see when I zoom what happens. Everybody doesn't have a nice a7R3
[00:55:56.920 --> 00:56:02.600]   and R4 like Mr. LaPorte has you know but if they have a nice phone take advantage of it. Well and
[00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:13.480]   they probably have their phone on them and they don't have right a7R4R2D2. There you go. That's
[00:56:14.280 --> 00:56:20.840]   there you go. Help me. Ant you're my only hope. So tell me about this this messages thing. I guess
[00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:26.360]   people are all right. We've got carriers jumping on board with uh yeah so this is interesting.
[00:56:26.360 --> 00:56:33.160]   Google and its messaging mess whatever you want to call it's 9,000 messaging apps. It has
[00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:38.760]   a story to history and it again failure. My goodness. Sorry everyone. You have clearly
[00:56:38.760 --> 00:56:44.200]   trained your phone sir. Too well. Too well. All it's listening for is the word Google at this point.
[00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:51.640]   So Android messaging as we know as we have talked about so many times on this network and I'm sure
[00:56:51.640 --> 00:56:58.440]   you've heard it just really sucks because there's no one clear definitive approach. At least on iOS
[00:56:58.440 --> 00:57:05.000]   you have iMessages. Everybody's on that. It works. It's secure. It's feature rich.
[00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:11.320]   So great. You know you can party and uh and we have to believe too. We don't. You know we throw
[00:57:11.320 --> 00:57:17.400]   ourselves a pity party because on Android it's a new thing every year and Google has tried and
[00:57:17.400 --> 00:57:23.880]   tried and tried and my goodness they cannot figure this sucker out. So last year they ended up going
[00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:30.600]   with something called RCS rich communication services and it was meant to be the future. They
[00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:37.960]   wanted to. They were basically at that point saying look we can't do it. So why don't we replace SMS
[00:57:37.960 --> 00:57:44.440]   with this new uh this this new standard called RCS and you know you can do RCS in a number of
[00:57:44.440 --> 00:57:49.560]   different directions in a number of different ways. Google says use universal profile. All the
[00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:54.920]   carriers come on to this profile and get on the same page and then you know everybody on Android
[00:57:54.920 --> 00:57:58.920]   and crossing fingers Apple of course Apple's never talked about it so Apple doesn't care.
[00:57:59.720 --> 00:58:06.520]   Our stuff works folks. Yes exactly. You do you. We've got this figured out. Um and and then they
[00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:12.280]   just kind of waited. Google waited for the carriers to get on board and the carriers really didn't
[00:58:12.280 --> 00:58:17.320]   en masse which I think Google thought was going to happen. Certainly as an Android user that's what
[00:58:17.320 --> 00:58:22.040]   I hoped would happen right. I figured they would have because it's such a large market share of
[00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:27.240]   Android devices right there. You know I mean yes the iPhone is super popular but everybody can't
[00:58:27.240 --> 00:58:32.440]   afford an iPhone so you're going to get a lot of those inexpensive Samsung and George phones out
[00:58:32.440 --> 00:58:38.680]   there. Yep. Yep. So so now where we're at the reason that this has come up again is
[00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:45.480]   you know a handful of devices have supported Google's RCS universal profile thing. The
[00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:52.280]   get this the Pixel 3 supports it on uh on sprint and Verizon. The Pixel 4 does not. Right. At all.
[00:58:52.280 --> 00:58:56.840]   No. No. And that's and that's on the carriers. That's not on Google like. Makes perfect sense right.
[00:58:56.840 --> 00:59:02.200]   I'm just saying well we're not going to support it on the Pixel 4 even. It doesn't make any sense.
[00:59:02.200 --> 00:59:06.040]   It makes sense I suppose if you're the carriers and it definitely makes sense in light of the
[00:59:06.040 --> 00:59:12.360]   current news which is that the four major US carriers AT&T T-Mobile Verizon and Sprint have all
[00:59:12.360 --> 00:59:19.880]   banded together to create their own chat venture called Cross Carrier Messaging Initiative or CCMI
[00:59:19.880 --> 00:59:28.600]   where they promise to basically bring RCS in their own way. So it's RCS but they just
[00:59:28.600 --> 00:59:33.880]   want a different name for it. It's their flavor of RCS. Oh my god. So that's only further bifurcating
[00:59:33.880 --> 00:59:39.640]   the whole thing and yeah but they're all on board. But if they're all on board is not really going
[00:59:39.640 --> 00:59:46.840]   to confuse anything right. It won't they are making their own messaging app. Wait. Do you have to
[00:59:46.840 --> 00:59:51.400]   use their messaging and if you buy a phone and when I understand on any of those networks
[00:59:51.400 --> 00:59:58.600]   you will get that messaging app as your default. Oh joy. And you know how to be great.
[00:59:58.600 --> 01:00:05.240]   Huh. Carriers create apps. They have a story history of amazing apps. This is so laughable.
[01:00:05.240 --> 01:00:10.840]   So that's where we're kind of out right now. I did read that there's some news that they worked
[01:00:10.840 --> 01:00:14.840]   with companies like Samsung and Google to be sure that the standard works with their apps.
[01:00:14.840 --> 01:00:18.920]   Although in their press release Google was not mentioned even once.
[01:00:18.920 --> 01:00:25.400]   My question is is this when they say does not support it on the Pixel 4 because it was like
[01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:29.400]   some interest in time and when all of this happened. Yeah. One could have argued that
[01:00:29.400 --> 01:00:35.400]   Verizon for example said yeah that Pixel 4 is going nowhere. So why are we even going to bother
[01:00:35.400 --> 01:00:38.600]   or they were already saying yeah we're got something that we're going to work seeing but we're not
[01:00:38.600 --> 01:00:42.520]   going to talk about it. Just shit just wait just wait. Do you think it was one of those? I feel like
[01:00:42.520 --> 01:00:47.240]   it was the latter if it was one of those. Okay. But that's total total guess.
[01:00:47.240 --> 01:00:53.960]   No, it's not encrypted. Well and that's one of the issues with RCS just as a whole is that it's an
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:59.640]   unencrypted messaging platform. You know and so of course iMessages that is encrypted.
[01:00:59.640 --> 01:01:07.480]   So right out of the gate this has you know RCS is not perfect. But it's better than SMS.
[01:01:07.480 --> 01:01:14.440]   It is a richer delivery. Every time I send a message with SMS and it makes the photo like this big.
[01:01:14.440 --> 01:01:23.400]   And I don't like I don't like. You want all the pixels. I just want people to have the things
[01:01:23.400 --> 01:01:30.040]   that I send them be delivered properly. Yes it's so true. So what I've taken to doing is if I'm sending
[01:01:30.040 --> 01:01:36.520]   a photo or a video or something like that to an Android user I upload it to my Google Photos
[01:01:36.520 --> 01:01:42.600]   account and then send a link to the Google Photos. That's a serious effort. Right.
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:48.120]   Because I don't want it to be this tiny little image. It's so true. I get something like oh we shot
[01:01:48.120 --> 01:01:53.160]   this video of your daughters at the performance here. And I mean it's a 3pp file.
[01:01:53.160 --> 01:01:59.560]   It's literally I'm watching a real player file.
[01:02:01.720 --> 01:02:06.760]   It's basically what I watch. We have one of those view finders. I'm like thanks for sending this to
[01:02:06.760 --> 01:02:14.280]   me. But I'm going to do literally nothing. But I'm sure it's wonderful. So anyways I don't know
[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:22.600]   what this is going to turn into ultimately. There is hope that and actually some word that
[01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:28.200]   Google is going to be able to tailor its own messaging app to support this same with Samsung.
[01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:36.040]   So at the end of the day maybe it'll be fine. If Google's messaging app is the one that we
[01:02:36.040 --> 01:02:41.640]   choose is the one that I use and it supports this and more people are using it because the carriers
[01:02:41.640 --> 01:02:47.240]   have truly rolled it out to all their Android phones then great. Is Google's messaging app
[01:02:47.240 --> 01:02:52.440]   encrypted and ined? They're messaging? No it's SMS. So it's just SMS.
[01:02:53.560 --> 01:02:58.200]   Yeah if if they had stuck on Hangouts which was their initial plan. Yeah why didn't they just
[01:02:58.200 --> 01:03:03.080]   stick with Hangouts Hangouts was great. It wasn't great. I loved Hangouts. It wasn't great but it
[01:03:03.080 --> 01:03:08.200]   worked. It was yeah it was fine. I actually still use Hangouts. I still use it as part of our family
[01:03:08.200 --> 01:03:14.680]   group chat. Yeah exactly. I thought it was going away. Well the messy we're still waiting. Yes.
[01:03:14.680 --> 01:03:18.120]   We're still waiting. We have a contingency plan but as long as it's still there we're
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:24.360]   still waiting. We chat. No. What's happening? No no no no no. I'm probably going to end up with
[01:03:24.360 --> 01:03:33.720]   slacker or something quite honestly. All it is is just me and the family just saying hey I'm
[01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:38.200]   coming home right now or hey I'm going to practice or you need to do the dishes. That's it. It's
[01:03:38.200 --> 01:03:45.560]   no more no less. Nothing real complicated. Oh boy. Instagram group chat. No.
[01:03:47.400 --> 01:03:52.200]   I get enough of those notifications man. There's just chat everywhere. You know and now I am on
[01:03:52.200 --> 01:03:57.800]   Instagram so now I'm getting DMs through Instagram. Just like cool. Here I am again messaging on 10
[01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:03.080]   different platforms. I get a lot of noise. It's hard for me to manage those those notifications so I
[01:04:03.080 --> 01:04:07.880]   need to keep the family broken off somewhere else and Hangouts helps with that. Yeah and not
[01:04:07.880 --> 01:04:16.680]   encourage the kids to spend more time on Instagram. No you get it. That's my master plan. That works.
[01:04:16.680 --> 01:04:22.680]   That works. Let's take a break and thank the sponsor of this episode of This Week in Tech is
[01:04:22.680 --> 01:04:29.560]   brought to you by World Wide Technology. WWT began building their advanced technology center
[01:04:29.560 --> 01:04:35.720]   10 years ago and ever since it's grown exponentially. It's like no other testing and research lab.
[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:41.160]   The lab contains more than a half billion dollars in equipment from hundreds of OEMs and key
[01:04:41.160 --> 01:04:47.640]   partners ranging from heavyweights like Dell EMC, VMware and Intel to emerging disruptors like
[01:04:47.640 --> 01:04:54.200]   TANEM, Equinix and Expanse. WWT is a trusted partner who stays with you over the years. Many
[01:04:54.200 --> 01:04:59.400]   of their customers have actually been with them for over a decade because they know that WWT is
[01:04:59.400 --> 01:05:03.240]   where they can go to get the answers they need to make sure their business runs right.
[01:05:03.240 --> 01:05:10.120]   Their ATC is an incubator for IT innovation offers a number of things on demand and scheduleable
[01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:18.280]   labs like Dell EMC, VxRail, Xtreme IO, X2 and Isilon. These labs represent the newest advances
[01:05:18.280 --> 01:05:22.920]   in primary storage. There are hundreds of labs to explore including multi-cloud,
[01:05:22.920 --> 01:05:28.920]   hyperconverged infrastructure, networking, secondary storage, data analytics, AI and more.
[01:05:28.920 --> 01:05:36.120]   You can learn about products before you launch. WWT's engineers use these environments to quickly
[01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:41.800]   spin up proofs of concept and pilots using the sandbox so customers can confidently select
[01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:48.120]   the best solutions. In many cases this reduces the concept time from months to weeks which
[01:05:48.120 --> 01:05:54.360]   increases speed to market. That's super important. They offer lab as a service, a dedicated lab space
[01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:59.400]   within the ATC and this is where customers can perform programmatic testing using the VAST
[01:05:59.400 --> 01:06:05.880]   technology ecosystem that WWT has already built. It's virtual so you can take full advantage of
[01:06:05.880 --> 01:06:13.560]   ATC's unique benefits anywhere in the world 24/7. WWT engineers work in these labs every
[01:06:13.560 --> 01:06:17.880]   single day. They're beta testing new equipment, they're building reference architectures and
[01:06:17.880 --> 01:06:23.720]   custom integrations that will help their customers make decisions and see results faster and with
[01:06:23.720 --> 01:06:30.200]   much less investment. The time is finally here. WWT has launched their new digital platform
[01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:36.200]   encompassing the ATC ecosystem. This ecosystem creates a multiplier effect of knowledge,
[01:06:36.200 --> 01:06:41.720]   speed and agility anytime, anywhere around the world for their customers. You can get access
[01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:46.440]   to articles, case studies, hands-on labs and other tools that make the difference in today's
[01:06:46.440 --> 01:06:54.760]   fast-paced world. You can learn more about WWT, the ATC and sign up for access to their new on-demand
[01:06:54.760 --> 01:07:03.800]   lab platform. All you have to do is go to www.t.com/twit and create an account today. WWT actually
[01:07:03.800 --> 01:07:12.200]   simplifies the complex. That's www.t.com/twit. WWT is delivering business and technology outcomes
[01:07:12.200 --> 01:07:17.160]   across the world. We thank them for their support of this weekend tech.
[01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:26.200]   All right. We've done it. We've talked about the messaging mess and I've gone all riled up again
[01:07:26.200 --> 01:07:32.920]   because it's never solved. But dang it, here we are again. One thing we didn't mention about the
[01:07:32.920 --> 01:07:37.560]   Pixel 4s is if you're in the UK and you were getting a Pixel 4 shipment, you got it in a cereal box.
[01:07:38.200 --> 01:07:44.520]   Oh, yeah, that's right. What? I wanted to get mine in a cereal box. Yeah, apparently they were
[01:07:44.520 --> 01:07:50.680]   holding a promotional thing where you get it delivered in a cereal box. There's a package of cereal
[01:07:50.680 --> 01:07:58.600]   on the inside. What was the cereal? It was almost like a lucky charms-ish type of cereal,
[01:07:58.600 --> 01:08:03.800]   but it was zero in total. So we had wheat? Probably. Oh, yeah, there's nothing good in the cereal.
[01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:11.080]   This is probably the cheapest of cheap cereals ever. 95 Google actually did a full review of the
[01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:17.800]   cereal. Oh, that's hilarious. So they even did a video unboxing and cereal review. The one time
[01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:23.960]   I'm glad I'm letting you take it. It's a portion. Yeah, it's a little tiny one. That goes in a cup.
[01:08:23.960 --> 01:08:28.920]   That won't even go on a bone. Everybody get it that way? No, it was only 2000. 2000 promotional
[01:08:29.480 --> 01:08:35.800]   deliveries. I wonder how they chose. Yeah, got the cereal. That's just Google being Googling and
[01:08:35.800 --> 01:08:41.720]   having a little cute moment, I guess. It adds no value to the phone, clearly. No, it doesn't.
[01:08:41.720 --> 01:08:47.720]   But I should say, holy moly, is that the ingredients? Yeah, it's hard to show because I don't have
[01:08:47.720 --> 01:08:54.280]   my laptop feeding into the tricaster. Oh, yeah. This is a wall of ingredients, so there's nothing
[01:08:54.280 --> 01:09:00.200]   good in this diet. Most of the words you can't even read. Highly processed goods,
[01:09:00.200 --> 01:09:07.800]   what it says in short. Dioxide, tartros, tyrannizine, quinoline, caramel, zine, ponkyo,
[01:09:07.800 --> 01:09:14.680]   allura, red starches, potato star. Everything a young Jason Howell is made of.
[01:09:14.680 --> 01:09:22.040]   Actually, there's the truth to that. If you want to be like Jason, these ingredients,
[01:09:23.320 --> 01:09:27.880]   there we go. We got what we're talking about. We've done the Google, we've done the Facebook.
[01:09:27.880 --> 01:09:33.160]   Well, we haven't done all the Google. That's true. Also, what? So they shipped out a firmware
[01:09:33.160 --> 01:09:41.480]   update. Is this for old Google homes or is this for Nest homes that brick these devices? I believe
[01:09:41.480 --> 01:09:47.240]   that this affects the old Google homes and Google Home minis and not all of them. Apparently,
[01:09:47.240 --> 01:09:52.040]   over the last few months, people were returning home to find their home.
[01:09:52.040 --> 01:09:59.880]   Not turning on. They thought that there was a firmware update of some sort that had flashed over
[01:09:59.880 --> 01:10:06.440]   and made it inoperable. People would call Google and Google would do that thing before they really
[01:10:06.440 --> 01:10:09.720]   have a handle on it where the support would be like, "Well, I don't know what to tell you."
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:18.120]   Nothing infuriates a tech user more than when a company pushes an update to something. It breaks
[01:10:18.120 --> 01:10:21.400]   it. The company doesn't immediately say, "Oh, we'll take care of that for now." Yeah.
[01:10:21.400 --> 01:10:29.240]   It was working until you did something with a company. So anyways, now Google is admitting,
[01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:34.200]   yes, hey, there is a problem here. They're aware of that. I wonder how many people were actually
[01:10:34.200 --> 01:10:40.360]   affected though. I don't know. And how much it's going to cost Google in making good on it.
[01:10:41.160 --> 01:10:45.880]   I mean, yeah, I'm going to go home and update my firmware so I can get a new one.
[01:10:45.880 --> 01:10:50.200]   Yeah, you can get a brand new one. I wonder if they replaced the home mini with a nest mini.
[01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:54.600]   But I've got a home. So what were they replaced that with? Nothing.
[01:10:54.600 --> 01:10:58.680]   Both of them were affected, right? The home and home mini.
[01:10:58.680 --> 01:11:05.560]   Correct. But I want a new thing. What is your home now working for you?
[01:11:05.560 --> 01:11:08.600]   No, it's fine. It's fine. It's one more thing.
[01:11:08.600 --> 01:11:11.160]   I just want it to be refreshed.
[01:11:11.160 --> 01:11:12.120]   In shiny.
[01:11:12.120 --> 01:11:15.560]   Yeah, like a brand new one.
[01:11:15.560 --> 01:11:17.320]   Of course. You know how you can refresh it?
[01:11:17.320 --> 01:11:19.080]   Get the new nest mini. That's true.
[01:11:19.080 --> 01:11:23.400]   Because it actually does sound better. I connected a couple of days ago. It sounds pretty good.
[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:27.880]   In pairs of the home mini. Okay. So what about the home?
[01:11:27.880 --> 01:11:31.000]   I'm fine with the home. Do you mean the sound of the home?
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:36.040]   Yeah. Yeah, I'm happy with it. I mean, it's not audio file quality.
[01:11:36.040 --> 01:11:37.800]   I don't have any minis. I just have the home.
[01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:43.880]   Okay. I don't have one. But again, I've heard it and expectations of two-dag
[01:11:43.880 --> 01:11:46.760]   them off of these things on speakers are just too high.
[01:11:46.760 --> 01:11:48.440]   Yeah. Okay.
[01:11:48.440 --> 01:11:52.120]   Well, I mean, I agree with that. I think you agree with one of that.
[01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:52.760]   Okay. All right.
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:52.760]   Good.
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:52.760]   All right.
[01:11:52.760 --> 01:11:54.200]   Just make sure.
[01:11:54.200 --> 01:11:55.080]   Wait a minute.
[01:11:55.080 --> 01:11:57.960]   I'm getting expectations of two-dag them off.
[01:11:57.960 --> 01:12:00.120]   No, you know, rent is two-dag them off.
[01:12:00.120 --> 01:12:07.080]   You know, for us, the thing I love about our Google Home is we have a battery pack.
[01:12:07.640 --> 01:12:08.680]   Attachment for it.
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:10.440]   Is it with a third party?
[01:12:10.440 --> 01:12:13.400]   Yeah. It's a third party. I wish I could remember the name off the top of my head.
[01:12:13.400 --> 01:12:14.840]   Maybe I'll search my email for it.
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:21.720]   But it's so when it's plugged in, as it is 90% of the time, it's charged the battery to full and
[01:12:21.720 --> 01:12:27.560]   it's all good. And then like my girls, we have a area in the backyard with grass and they like
[01:12:27.560 --> 01:12:30.200]   to do dance shows and gymnastics shows and I like to play music.
[01:12:30.200 --> 01:12:30.680]   That's cool.
[01:12:30.680 --> 01:12:34.520]   So they unplug the home, take it out there. It never loses its connection.
[01:12:34.520 --> 01:12:35.080]   Nice.
[01:12:35.080 --> 01:12:39.080]   It is immediately on battery and that battery lasts for like five hours.
[01:12:39.080 --> 01:12:41.160]   You have a UPS for your Google Home.
[01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:41.640]   Totally.
[01:12:41.640 --> 01:12:45.240]   I have it charged up too in case PGD goes out.
[01:12:45.240 --> 01:12:46.520]   Of course, there will be no internet.
[01:12:46.520 --> 01:12:48.360]   So it would be useless, is this it?
[01:12:48.360 --> 01:12:50.520]   The loft?
[01:12:50.520 --> 01:12:51.320]   Yes.
[01:12:51.320 --> 01:12:52.120]   That's it.
[01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:52.680]   The loft.
[01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:53.640]   That's pretty cool.
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:54.120]   You got it.
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:58.440]   So that's the '97 loft.
[01:12:58.440 --> 01:12:58.760]   Yeah.
[01:12:58.760 --> 01:12:59.560]   That's what it's called.
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:12:59.720]   Yeah.
[01:12:59.720 --> 01:13:02.120]   So yeah, I think that company's called '97 and then the...
[01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:02.840]   Right.
[01:13:03.400 --> 01:13:07.320]   That's a battery base for the Google Home and all out of Lincoln.
[01:13:07.320 --> 01:13:09.880]   And it kind of blends in.
[01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:12.040]   The one that I have is white like the Google Home.
[01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:13.400]   So it blends in with the designs.
[01:13:13.400 --> 01:13:13.880]   Ooh.
[01:13:13.880 --> 01:13:14.520]   It doesn't stand out.
[01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:14.920]   Ooh.
[01:13:14.920 --> 01:13:15.960]   Wow.
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:18.520]   I might have to get one of those bad boys.
[01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:19.880]   And it's just really great.
[01:13:19.880 --> 01:13:21.320]   You know, you push that button on the bottom.
[01:13:21.320 --> 01:13:23.000]   It tells you how much battery there is.
[01:13:23.000 --> 01:13:25.240]   If you hold it down, it kills the power.
[01:13:25.240 --> 01:13:26.840]   Because that's what I hate about the HomePod.
[01:13:26.840 --> 01:13:29.640]   Is I want to be able to move my HomePod places.
[01:13:29.640 --> 01:13:31.000]   Because I've got one of each.
[01:13:31.000 --> 01:13:33.880]   I've had, you know, for writing about all the different smart speakers.
[01:13:33.880 --> 01:13:34.040]   Yeah.
[01:13:34.040 --> 01:13:36.440]   And so I've got the most echoes though.
[01:13:36.440 --> 01:13:37.640]   They're just everywhere.
[01:13:37.640 --> 01:13:41.240]   But I've got the Google Home and the HomePod.
[01:13:41.240 --> 01:13:44.040]   And the HomePod, I wish I could move it to different places.
[01:13:44.040 --> 01:13:46.760]   Of course, some people have since said,
[01:13:46.760 --> 01:13:51.320]   "You know, there are some companies that make those gigantic charging bricks
[01:13:51.320 --> 01:13:53.400]   that you can actually plug AC power into."
[01:13:53.400 --> 01:13:54.040]   Oh.
[01:13:54.040 --> 01:13:54.360]   Yeah.
[01:13:54.360 --> 01:13:54.840]   No, I'm not doing that.
[01:13:54.840 --> 01:13:55.960]   This is not a salad.
[01:13:55.960 --> 01:13:56.040]   Yeah.
[01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:56.040]   Right.
[01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:56.040]   Yeah.
[01:13:56.040 --> 01:13:57.240]   This is gorgeous.
[01:13:57.240 --> 01:13:57.960]   This looks great.
[01:13:57.960 --> 01:13:58.120]   Yeah.
[01:13:58.120 --> 01:14:00.760]   It's nice that it's all one tight unit.
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:02.440]   And it works really well.
[01:14:02.440 --> 01:14:03.560]   Like I do every time.
[01:14:03.560 --> 01:14:07.320]   So I think I take it for granted now because I'm so used to having it.
[01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:09.640]   But yeah, I don't mind the sound of it.
[01:14:09.640 --> 01:14:11.240]   For my kids' dance shows.
[01:14:11.240 --> 01:14:11.480]   Yeah.
[01:14:11.480 --> 01:14:12.440]   Whatever it's worth.
[01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:13.400]   It's good enough for that.
[01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:13.880]   It's great for that.
[01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:16.440]   It's good enough for that piece of my dad time right there.
[01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:16.840]   Totally.
[01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:16.840]   Totally.
[01:14:16.840 --> 01:14:17.320]   Totally.
[01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:18.280]   Oh, that rhymed.
[01:14:18.280 --> 01:14:18.840]   Piece of mine.
[01:14:18.840 --> 01:14:19.240]   Oh, wow.
[01:14:19.240 --> 01:14:20.200]   I'm a rapper too.
[01:14:20.200 --> 01:14:24.280]   So let's see here.
[01:14:24.280 --> 01:14:25.560]   What else?
[01:14:25.560 --> 01:14:26.600]   Amazon.
[01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:27.640]   Okay.
[01:14:27.640 --> 01:14:30.200]   This is, I thought this was a fascinating thing.
[01:14:30.200 --> 01:14:38.040]   So Amazon of course is notorious for barely being profitable or if they are profitable,
[01:14:38.040 --> 01:14:42.440]   it's not where other tech companies kind of have to be.
[01:14:42.440 --> 01:14:49.560]   And despite that, Amazon shareholders for the most part don't make a big stink over it.
[01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:52.440]   Whereas other companies, tech companies get a lot of big stink.
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:56.120]   Amazon is an odd company in so many ways.
[01:14:56.120 --> 01:15:00.520]   But where they make their money, AWS of course is a big thing.
[01:15:00.520 --> 01:15:00.600]   Yep.
[01:15:00.600 --> 01:15:03.000]   But it turns out, yeah, doing very well.
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:08.760]   Where they're spending most of their money right now because they just had their earnings
[01:15:08.760 --> 01:15:10.520]   report, was it yesterday?
[01:15:10.520 --> 01:15:11.240]   Yes, they're doing, yeah.
[01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:11.240]   Yeah.
[01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:16.520]   They're spending billions of dollars.
[01:15:16.520 --> 01:15:21.560]   In fact, up to $9.6 billion of spending on shipping.
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:24.840]   They want it to be, because right now,
[01:15:25.720 --> 01:15:32.200]   I order, again, I'm a terrible person after I did the triangulation interview about garbage.
[01:15:32.200 --> 01:15:37.640]   And I should stop ordering from Amazon because it turns out your boxes are probably not being
[01:15:37.640 --> 01:15:38.920]   recycled, but that's a whole other story.
[01:15:38.920 --> 01:15:43.240]   And so I'm ordering Amazon stuff all the time.
[01:15:43.240 --> 01:15:48.360]   The only reason that I go to the store for something, I mean, groceries is another thing,
[01:15:48.360 --> 01:15:51.320]   but I'm talking like everything that's not groceries.
[01:15:51.320 --> 01:15:51.800]   Right.
[01:15:51.800 --> 01:15:55.160]   The only reason I go to the store for something is if I want it now and not later,
[01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:59.080]   like if I decide that I don't want to wait two days for it, or in some cases,
[01:15:59.080 --> 01:16:03.640]   I can't wait two days for it or one day or whatever, then I will go to the store.
[01:16:03.640 --> 01:16:08.520]   But everything else, I just get on Amazon because I can count on a fair price,
[01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:11.480]   you know, that's compared to wherever else you might be getting it.
[01:16:11.480 --> 01:16:17.240]   We have never been overcharged by Amazon that it'll arrive directly to me.
[01:16:17.240 --> 01:16:19.400]   Like it takes away inconvenience.
[01:16:19.400 --> 01:16:26.120]   And so now they're continuing to spend money to try and make it so that those decisions
[01:16:26.120 --> 01:16:30.840]   aren't even ones you have to make where you're not even going, well, because I need it right now,
[01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:32.200]   I'll just go to the store and get it.
[01:16:32.200 --> 01:16:38.200]   They want to spend enough money to make it so that you can get it as quick as possible.
[01:16:38.200 --> 01:16:42.840]   Again, this is more of a long game thing here.
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:48.280]   They're going to spend a bunch of money up front, but it can potentially just come back
[01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:50.040]   in multiple folds of profit.
[01:16:50.040 --> 01:16:52.120]   You know, more people will be interested.
[01:16:52.120 --> 01:16:57.800]   I mean, granted, it seems like everybody's using Prime now anyway, but you get in this one day
[01:16:57.800 --> 01:17:01.960]   shipping as an extra incentive and people are like, well, yeah, I'll pay to 100 and whatever
[01:17:01.960 --> 01:17:05.480]   month, however much it is a year is at $120 a year, something like that.
[01:17:05.480 --> 01:17:06.360]   I can't remember it.
[01:17:06.360 --> 01:17:08.280]   It's just what's trying to make it happen.
[01:17:08.280 --> 01:17:08.760]   It's just what it's like.
[01:17:08.760 --> 01:17:09.320]   It's just what it's like.
[01:17:09.320 --> 01:17:10.040]   Yes, it's right.
[01:17:10.040 --> 01:17:10.520]   You know.
[01:17:10.520 --> 01:17:13.640]   And so in Amazon is just banking on that.
[01:17:13.640 --> 01:17:14.840]   We're going to get more people.
[01:17:14.840 --> 01:17:18.840]   It's going to be an investment in ourselves and it's going to come back.
[01:17:18.840 --> 01:17:25.960]   Well, one of the things that I found fascinating from Jeff Bezos, he says, although it's counterintuitive,
[01:17:25.960 --> 01:17:31.160]   the fastest delivery speeds generate the least carbon emissions because these products ship
[01:17:31.160 --> 01:17:33.960]   from fulfillment centers very close to the customer.
[01:17:33.960 --> 01:17:37.480]   It simply becomes impractical to use air or long ground routes.
[01:17:37.480 --> 01:17:44.440]   So what he's saying is like, you might go online and you see one day shipping and you see
[01:17:44.440 --> 01:17:45.960]   three day shipping or something like that.
[01:17:45.960 --> 01:17:46.440]   Yeah.
[01:17:46.440 --> 01:17:49.800]   And you might think, I'm going to choose three day shipping because I want to be green today.
[01:17:49.800 --> 01:17:55.160]   It turns out choosing one day is a better option because it's the most practical way to get it to you
[01:17:55.160 --> 01:17:57.480]   is by having it at a local facility.
[01:17:57.480 --> 01:18:03.480]   And I can remember it's been a long time now, but there was a story out a while back that
[01:18:03.480 --> 01:18:11.240]   was looking at the way that Amazon was using artificial intelligence to pre-determine
[01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:18.360]   what customers would be ordering in order to use their logistics centers to get those products
[01:18:18.360 --> 01:18:19.400]   to the right place.
[01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:20.920]   So you can imagine that if I--
[01:18:20.920 --> 01:18:21.640]   That's beautiful.
[01:18:21.640 --> 01:18:27.000]   If I once a month order a big thing of the greenies dog treats that I give my dogs,
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:30.040]   then they are great.
[01:18:30.040 --> 01:18:31.560]   According to them--
[01:18:31.560 --> 01:18:32.920]   Why are y'all eating dog treats?
[01:18:32.920 --> 01:18:34.200]   They're so delicious.
[01:18:34.200 --> 01:18:37.320]   Look, I don't eat any vegetables.
[01:18:37.320 --> 01:18:37.640]   Yeah.
[01:18:37.640 --> 01:18:39.560]   The only greens that I eat, okay?
[01:18:39.560 --> 01:18:41.160]   They're very minty.
[01:18:41.160 --> 01:18:41.800]   They're fresh.
[01:18:41.800 --> 01:18:44.120]   They clean my teeth, right?
[01:18:44.120 --> 01:18:47.880]   To be clear, they're great for the dog, says the veterinarian.
[01:18:47.880 --> 01:19:10.360]   Better an A-
[01:19:11.160 --> 01:19:14.120]   And especially with they have all of these other subscription
[01:19:14.120 --> 01:19:16.520]   options in place already.
[01:19:16.520 --> 01:19:17.880]   It makes perfect sense.
[01:19:17.880 --> 01:19:19.800]   Go ahead and have everything ready.
[01:19:19.800 --> 01:19:21.320]   And get ready to grow.
[01:19:21.320 --> 01:19:21.720]   You got ready to grow.
[01:19:21.720 --> 01:19:24.200]   And included with prime.
[01:19:24.200 --> 01:19:28.680]   Coming up for this holiday season, one day shopping,
[01:19:28.680 --> 01:19:30.920]   apparently they're going to add this to millions of products.
[01:19:30.920 --> 01:19:32.280]   Yeah.
[01:19:32.280 --> 01:19:37.400]   And so that conditions the users to kind of expect that,
[01:19:37.400 --> 01:19:39.640]   which heightens the value of the service,
[01:19:39.640 --> 01:19:42.040]   because then at some point you realize that you
[01:19:42.040 --> 01:19:45.400]   are just getting one day shipping included.
[01:19:45.400 --> 01:19:47.000]   Of course, you're paying the prime fee,
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:50.200]   but now suddenly the value of prime shoots up even more.
[01:19:50.200 --> 01:19:50.840]   It just keeps getting, yeah.
[01:19:50.840 --> 01:19:55.640]   And eventually that becomes a profitable thing for Amazon.
[01:19:55.640 --> 01:19:58.680]   It makes me wonder if this was part of the reason
[01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:01.160]   and the relationship between Amazon and UPS,
[01:20:01.160 --> 01:20:04.920]   Sauer, because Amazon knew they really wanted to push this one day
[01:20:04.920 --> 01:20:07.240]   and getting more things to those fulfillment centers.
[01:20:07.240 --> 01:20:10.200]   Somebody had to get the stuff to those fulfillment centers
[01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:11.160]   in a timely matter.
[01:20:11.160 --> 01:20:14.040]   Yes, I'm sure Amazon took the last mile,
[01:20:14.040 --> 01:20:18.760]   but I wonder if that was part of the Sauer relationship.
[01:20:18.760 --> 01:20:19.960]   Yeah, I wouldn't be surprised.
[01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:23.880]   Amazon has to be, at the same time,
[01:20:23.880 --> 01:20:28.920]   Amazon has to be credited in some ways for saving
[01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:30.360]   the United States Postal Service.
[01:20:30.360 --> 01:20:33.480]   So there was a period of time,
[01:20:33.480 --> 01:20:36.280]   because I was working at Newsy at the time,
[01:20:36.280 --> 01:20:41.960]   and I remember doing story after story about how the USPS workers
[01:20:41.960 --> 01:20:45.720]   were maybe not going to get their retirement funds,
[01:20:45.720 --> 01:20:48.440]   how they were trying to find new ways to get people to spend money,
[01:20:48.440 --> 01:20:49.400]   how they were trying.
[01:20:49.400 --> 01:20:50.920]   And Amazon came in and said,
[01:20:50.920 --> 01:20:53.640]   "Well, right now with UPS and FedEx,
[01:20:53.640 --> 01:20:57.480]   we can't do Sunday deliveries in,
[01:20:57.480 --> 01:20:59.720]   I think maybe it's even Saturday and Sunday deliveries,
[01:20:59.720 --> 01:21:02.120]   but definitely Sunday deliveries in most places."
[01:21:02.760 --> 01:21:05.960]   And if you want to do an exclusive deal with us,
[01:21:05.960 --> 01:21:10.840]   we will buy that opportunity to do Sunday deliveries.
[01:21:10.840 --> 01:21:16.760]   And that was a great influx of cash for the USPS at the time,
[01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:19.320]   which a lot of people think that the United States Postal Service
[01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:20.840]   is funded by our taxes.
[01:21:20.840 --> 01:21:21.640]   It is not.
[01:21:21.640 --> 01:21:23.720]   It is an independently funded organization.
[01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:24.680]   And a lot of people--
[01:21:24.680 --> 01:21:25.560]   Okay, I didn't know that.
[01:21:25.560 --> 01:21:31.240]   Yeah, so, and that's a big important thing to note here
[01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:34.680]   is that the USPS is a separate organization,
[01:21:34.680 --> 01:21:38.760]   despite the fact that it has many a tie to the government
[01:21:38.760 --> 01:21:41.080]   because of how it was founded and everything like that,
[01:21:41.080 --> 01:21:43.480]   in the US Postmaster.
[01:21:43.480 --> 01:21:47.320]   However, it is a organization that's completely funded
[01:21:47.320 --> 01:21:50.440]   by what we put into it or what companies put into it.
[01:21:50.440 --> 01:21:52.840]   And so that's why stamps and things like that are so important.
[01:21:52.840 --> 01:21:55.960]   And in fact, because of a certain president
[01:21:55.960 --> 01:22:00.280]   giving out the idea that the USPS was funded by the government
[01:22:00.280 --> 01:22:02.120]   by our-- through our taxes,
[01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:05.480]   the USPS has this whole FAQ on their website
[01:22:05.480 --> 01:22:07.960]   that very clearly spells out everything
[01:22:07.960 --> 01:22:10.680]   and why it is not a tax-funded organization.
[01:22:10.680 --> 01:22:11.720]   Wow.
[01:22:11.720 --> 01:22:14.280]   But-- so Amazon, like, in terms of shipping,
[01:22:14.280 --> 01:22:16.200]   I think it has to get credit for that.
[01:22:16.200 --> 01:22:18.840]   And two, I--
[01:22:18.840 --> 01:22:21.480]   You know, earlier I was complaining about the different things
[01:22:21.480 --> 01:22:23.560]   I wasn't warned about with California.
[01:22:23.560 --> 01:22:25.560]   One, one I forgot to complain about,
[01:22:25.560 --> 01:22:26.760]   but it's a good thing overall,
[01:22:26.760 --> 01:22:27.800]   so I'm not really complaining.
[01:22:27.800 --> 01:22:30.840]   I'm just complaining about myself for not ever remembering
[01:22:30.840 --> 01:22:34.440]   that if I go to the store, I need to bring dog-on bags.
[01:22:34.440 --> 01:22:35.640]   Yeah, yeah, that's right.
[01:22:35.640 --> 01:22:36.200]   Yeah, you do.
[01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:37.960]   And I keep forgetting that.
[01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:39.960]   And so when I'm taken to doing--
[01:22:39.960 --> 01:22:43.880]   because I have a Amazon Prime subscription already
[01:22:43.880 --> 01:22:50.520]   is make use of the Amazon Prime Whole Foods market thing.
[01:22:50.520 --> 01:22:53.800]   And so I can order most of my groceries online
[01:22:54.360 --> 01:22:58.440]   and they come to my door in paper bags
[01:22:58.440 --> 01:23:01.480]   that I then fold up and tuck away for one day
[01:23:01.480 --> 01:23:03.000]   when I will use them in a store,
[01:23:03.000 --> 01:23:04.680]   except I always forget to put them in my car.
[01:23:04.680 --> 01:23:07.320]   We've got a glowing pile of paper bags at this point.
[01:23:07.320 --> 01:23:08.120]   I'm going to compost them.
[01:23:08.120 --> 01:23:09.400]   You should have a recycling bin.
[01:23:09.400 --> 01:23:10.600]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:23:10.600 --> 01:23:10.840]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:23:10.840 --> 01:23:11.800]   I'll give you credit for that.
[01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:16.760]   But that, too, is like an added benefit that Amazon has done.
[01:23:16.760 --> 01:23:19.640]   And the system that's set up in place
[01:23:19.640 --> 01:23:23.240]   to deliver those groceries from the--
[01:23:23.240 --> 01:23:25.880]   because it's free shipping or free delivery.
[01:23:25.880 --> 01:23:27.080]   Like you don't pay a delivery fee for it
[01:23:27.080 --> 01:23:29.320]   if your name is on Prime, a subscriber.
[01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:32.360]   And so that also, a thing that I like about it is the fact
[01:23:32.360 --> 01:23:33.560]   that the tip goes to--
[01:23:33.560 --> 01:23:35.000]   like you can give--
[01:23:35.000 --> 01:23:36.440]   well, you can always give a bigger tip.
[01:23:36.440 --> 01:23:38.920]   But you are not paying a delivery fee.
[01:23:38.920 --> 01:23:41.240]   And so it feels like I can send more money
[01:23:41.240 --> 01:23:42.440]   than to the person who's driving it.
[01:23:42.440 --> 01:23:43.560]   Oh, yeah.
[01:23:43.560 --> 01:23:44.440]   So I like that.
[01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:48.600]   It's been a really long time since I ordered groceries online.
[01:23:48.600 --> 01:23:50.280]   Like web van long?
[01:23:50.280 --> 01:23:51.480]   Do you remember web van?
[01:23:51.480 --> 01:23:52.840]   Never ordered groceries online.
[01:23:52.840 --> 01:23:53.480]   My man.
[01:23:53.480 --> 01:23:54.040]   Web van.
[01:23:54.040 --> 01:23:54.520]   Never done it.
[01:23:54.520 --> 01:23:58.760]   Web van was a .com bubble company.
[01:23:58.760 --> 01:23:59.160]   Oh, really?
[01:23:59.160 --> 01:23:59.720]   That long ago.
[01:23:59.720 --> 01:24:03.960]   This was a company that tried to do this back in 2001.
[01:24:03.960 --> 01:24:07.320]   Well, no, that's when they filed for bankruptcy was 2001.
[01:24:07.320 --> 01:24:08.920]   But I remember doing this back then.
[01:24:08.920 --> 01:24:09.640]   And--
[01:24:09.640 --> 01:24:10.520]   Back in March, eh?
[01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:14.680]   Well, and obviously, things have come a long way
[01:24:14.680 --> 01:24:16.600]   in nearly 20 years, right?
[01:24:16.600 --> 01:24:17.640]   Yeah, I think.
[01:24:17.640 --> 01:24:19.640]   But I remember it being kind of a pain in the butt
[01:24:19.640 --> 01:24:22.120]   to think about what groceries I wanted
[01:24:22.120 --> 01:24:23.560]   and ahead of time and do that.
[01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:26.360]   But this is how you're getting your groceries now.
[01:24:26.360 --> 01:24:28.600]   Like, do you like the process?
[01:24:28.600 --> 01:24:30.360]   I've been curious about it here.
[01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:32.280]   I've never tried it.
[01:24:32.280 --> 01:24:34.440]   There's a couple of times where it crossed my mind
[01:24:34.440 --> 01:24:36.680]   because I was just busy.
[01:24:36.680 --> 01:24:40.040]   But I've never done the online grocery thing.
[01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:41.960]   And it seems like it'd be pretty convenient.
[01:24:41.960 --> 01:24:44.280]   But I always end up at the corner store
[01:24:44.280 --> 01:24:45.560]   or at the market myself.
[01:24:45.560 --> 01:24:46.040]   Always.
[01:24:46.040 --> 01:24:46.760]   It took time.
[01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:47.560]   Yeah.
[01:24:47.560 --> 01:24:48.600]   So I will say that.
[01:24:48.600 --> 01:24:50.680]   Like, it took me time to figure out
[01:24:51.560 --> 01:24:55.480]   my, you know, what groceries I could get
[01:24:55.480 --> 01:24:56.360]   and how I wanted--
[01:24:56.360 --> 01:24:58.120]   But once I found out what--
[01:24:58.120 --> 01:24:59.800]   Whole Foods--
[01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:01.480]   Because basically what I did was I took
[01:25:01.480 --> 01:25:02.840]   what I already had at home
[01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:05.400]   and then did searches for those products.
[01:25:05.400 --> 01:25:07.240]   You know, so I have my, you know, peanut butter
[01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:09.320]   and I have bread, gluten-free bread.
[01:25:09.320 --> 01:25:10.920]   And I got this, that, and the other.
[01:25:10.920 --> 01:25:12.840]   And then I looked to see if it was available
[01:25:12.840 --> 01:25:17.000]   from Whole Foods and sort of replaced the other things
[01:25:17.000 --> 01:25:19.160]   with these things and found out that,
[01:25:19.160 --> 01:25:20.120]   OK, they have this.
[01:25:20.120 --> 01:25:21.720]   And then after you do it,
[01:25:21.720 --> 01:25:23.080]   they can start recommending things
[01:25:23.080 --> 01:25:24.280]   that you might be interested in.
[01:25:24.280 --> 01:25:25.960]   I also like the fact that they've got it set up
[01:25:25.960 --> 01:25:26.760]   so that--
[01:25:26.760 --> 01:25:27.880]   Feeding down the recipe.
[01:25:27.880 --> 01:25:30.360]   You want to do like, ingredient or recipe.
[01:25:30.360 --> 01:25:31.240]   They make it very easy.
[01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:33.320]   OK, we'll just add this whole thing to your shopping list
[01:25:33.320 --> 01:25:35.080]   and then you can make that dish or whatever.
[01:25:35.080 --> 01:25:35.640]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:25:35.640 --> 01:25:36.600]   Very nice.
[01:25:36.600 --> 01:25:41.000]   So yeah, I can get most, including if you wanted to order,
[01:25:41.000 --> 01:25:42.520]   you know, wine, beer, things like that.
[01:25:42.520 --> 01:25:45.640]   You can order it through Amazon Prime now as well.
[01:25:45.640 --> 01:25:48.600]   And that's the thing is that this is a little bit different
[01:25:48.600 --> 01:25:50.680]   from one day delivery where it comes the next day.
[01:25:50.680 --> 01:25:57.240]   This is, I order at noon and I have a delivery window
[01:25:57.240 --> 01:26:00.680]   between four and six that same day.
[01:26:00.680 --> 01:26:01.240]   So I get my--
[01:26:01.240 --> 01:26:02.040]   Because it's coming from your local--
[01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:02.040]   Right.
[01:26:02.040 --> 01:26:03.000]   Yeah, from Whole Foods.
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:03.400]   From Whole Foods.
[01:26:03.400 --> 01:26:03.800]   From Whole Foods.
[01:26:03.800 --> 01:26:05.320]   You know, a couple of miles away.
[01:26:05.320 --> 01:26:07.000]   Yeah, so I think that that's nice as well
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:09.560]   that people can, you know, get those groceries the same day
[01:26:09.560 --> 01:26:13.080]   and be as preemptive as they want to be about it.
[01:26:13.080 --> 01:26:16.680]   And from that perspective, it's interesting
[01:26:16.680 --> 01:26:20.840]   because, you know, Amazon is operating their grocery business
[01:26:20.840 --> 01:26:24.040]   same day delivery the way that they probably intend
[01:26:24.040 --> 01:26:27.640]   to operate their Amazon product delivery at some point.
[01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:27.640]   Yes.
[01:26:27.640 --> 01:26:30.920]   Like in a best case scenario, they'd have a warehouse
[01:26:30.920 --> 01:26:33.960]   that is mere miles away from everybody depending
[01:26:33.960 --> 01:26:37.560]   on where they happen to be with enough of the main core products
[01:26:37.560 --> 01:26:40.200]   that most people order so that they can get it to you
[01:26:40.200 --> 01:26:40.760]   on the same day.
[01:26:40.760 --> 01:26:42.360]   And I guarantee you that's what they're aiming for.
[01:26:42.360 --> 01:26:44.440]   And in fact, I wouldn't be surprised if they start
[01:26:44.440 --> 01:26:47.640]   finding areas in Whole Foods and their Whole Foods
[01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:51.000]   to serve as for the places.
[01:26:51.000 --> 01:26:53.720]   Or that informs kind of the buildings that they buy
[01:26:53.720 --> 01:26:54.520]   for New Whole Foods.
[01:26:54.520 --> 01:26:55.400]   Yeah, it's like a rare--
[01:26:55.400 --> 01:26:58.120]   Yeah, it's a new distro right here.
[01:26:58.120 --> 01:26:59.560]   Yeah, totally.
[01:26:59.560 --> 01:27:01.960]   And then at some point, we're going to have our little drones
[01:27:01.960 --> 01:27:03.320]   delivering our burritos and everything.
[01:27:03.320 --> 01:27:04.120]   It's going to be great.
[01:27:04.120 --> 01:27:05.960]   They have the approvals for that, you know.
[01:27:05.960 --> 01:27:06.600]   Until we--
[01:27:06.600 --> 01:27:07.880]   They aren't going to have the drone approvals.
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:09.320]   I just haven't seen anything.
[01:27:09.320 --> 01:27:09.560]   No.
[01:27:09.560 --> 01:27:11.640]   Until we get hit in the head with those drones and then--
[01:27:12.760 --> 01:27:14.440]   You get hit in the head with the drone.
[01:27:14.440 --> 01:27:15.000]   It's your fault.
[01:27:15.000 --> 01:27:16.280]   You should hear it coming.
[01:27:16.280 --> 01:27:17.880]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:27:17.880 --> 01:27:19.640]   That's a really good point.
[01:27:19.640 --> 01:27:20.200]   You should hear it coming.
[01:27:20.200 --> 01:27:21.800]   Well, I've got my noise canceling headphones on.
[01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:23.000]   Oh, no, nice try.
[01:27:23.000 --> 01:27:25.480]   You won't get hit by the drone.
[01:27:25.480 --> 01:27:27.640]   It'll be the burrito that the drone is carrying.
[01:27:27.640 --> 01:27:28.440]   Oh, that's right.
[01:27:28.440 --> 01:27:29.480]   You know, it's not that bad.
[01:27:29.480 --> 01:27:30.280]   It's the payload.
[01:27:30.280 --> 01:27:33.240]   No one cries when they get hit in the head with the burrito.
[01:27:33.240 --> 01:27:34.040]   Let's test it.
[01:27:34.040 --> 01:27:35.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:27:35.320 --> 01:27:38.040]   I should also point out here.
[01:27:38.040 --> 01:27:41.480]   Jeff Bezos was for a very small amount of time
[01:27:41.480 --> 01:27:43.320]   based on yesterday's earnings,
[01:27:43.320 --> 01:27:45.880]   knocked out of the lead as world's richest person.
[01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:46.280]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:27:46.280 --> 01:27:46.920]   Bill Gates.
[01:27:46.920 --> 01:27:47.400]   For about five minutes?
[01:27:47.400 --> 01:27:47.960]   Yeah.
[01:27:47.960 --> 01:27:50.280]   Over took based on after hours.
[01:27:50.280 --> 01:27:57.080]   The net income for Amazon, rather, for Q3 fell.
[01:27:57.080 --> 01:28:00.600]   26% shares fell 7% after hours.
[01:28:00.600 --> 01:28:02.600]   And during that time, Bill Gates was partying
[01:28:02.600 --> 01:28:05.960]   because he held the position for 24 years
[01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:07.880]   before Bezos took it over.
[01:28:07.880 --> 01:28:09.640]   And so for a short period of time, he had it.
[01:28:09.640 --> 01:28:13.800]   But now today, Bezos is back at around $109.9 billion
[01:28:13.800 --> 01:28:14.840]   net worth.
[01:28:14.840 --> 01:28:16.440]   You know that a boy, Jeff.
[01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:18.920]   And Bill Gates is going around the world
[01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:21.240]   and dropping loads and loads and loads of cash
[01:28:21.240 --> 01:28:22.680]   to save people's lives.
[01:28:22.680 --> 01:28:23.480]   Yeah.
[01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:26.280]   Bezos is just looking at ways to make more money.
[01:28:26.280 --> 01:28:27.080]   Yeah.
[01:28:27.080 --> 01:28:28.840]   But his Bezos can't knock the hustle down.
[01:28:28.840 --> 01:28:29.320]   Can't knock the hustle down.
[01:28:29.320 --> 01:28:32.120]   To where he can retire and then do exactly what Bill Gates is doing.
[01:28:32.120 --> 01:28:32.440]   I hope to do it.
[01:28:32.440 --> 01:28:34.360]   Did you just say it's where he can retire?
[01:28:34.360 --> 01:28:35.800]   He can retire now, right?
[01:28:35.800 --> 01:28:36.200]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:28:36.200 --> 01:28:37.800]   Where he will retire.
[01:28:37.800 --> 01:28:38.840]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:28:38.840 --> 01:28:39.960]   No, you're right.
[01:28:39.960 --> 01:28:41.560]   I mean, just put it in capable hands.
[01:28:41.560 --> 01:28:43.160]   You know.
[01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:43.880]   What is retirement?
[01:28:43.880 --> 01:28:45.880]   We're working towards my retirement.
[01:28:45.880 --> 01:28:47.160]   We're working towards my retirement.
[01:28:47.160 --> 01:28:48.280]   What am I building now?
[01:28:48.280 --> 01:28:49.400]   I don't think I'm tired of what is that rich.
[01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:50.280]   Yeah, you just got to--
[01:28:50.280 --> 01:28:51.240]   I don't even know what to do.
[01:28:51.240 --> 01:28:52.760]   You just continue spending money on things.
[01:28:52.760 --> 01:28:55.000]   And is it things for you or is it things for other people?
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:28:55.160]   Yeah.
[01:28:55.160 --> 01:28:57.640]   Bill Gates apparently is spending his money on other people.
[01:28:57.640 --> 01:29:00.440]   He's clearly ambitious to have all of that cash.
[01:29:00.440 --> 01:29:03.000]   And he's still trying to think of ways to make money.
[01:29:03.000 --> 01:29:06.520]   That's a special kind of brain there.
[01:29:06.520 --> 01:29:08.760]   He actually-- so Margaret O'Mara--
[01:29:08.760 --> 01:29:11.400]   I wish I could remember the book right now.
[01:29:11.400 --> 01:29:13.400]   But she recently wrote a book.
[01:29:13.400 --> 01:29:15.400]   I interviewed her for triangulation.
[01:29:15.400 --> 01:29:18.360]   I think that's going to be out a little bit later.
[01:29:18.360 --> 01:29:21.640]   She was talking about her particular fondness
[01:29:21.640 --> 01:29:25.120]   or interest rather in Jeff Bezos and what
[01:29:25.120 --> 01:29:27.000]   a fascinating character he is.
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:28.920]   And you should definitely--
[01:29:28.920 --> 01:29:32.440]   I'm actually going to look up the book because in talking
[01:29:32.440 --> 01:29:37.240]   about it, it's called The Code, yeah.
[01:29:37.240 --> 01:29:38.920]   And it's this book about Silicon Valley
[01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:40.680]   and how it was formed.
[01:29:40.680 --> 01:29:42.200]   So it's called The Code, Silicon Valley
[01:29:42.200 --> 01:29:44.400]   and the Remaking of America.
[01:29:44.400 --> 01:29:45.080]   Very fascinating.
[01:29:45.080 --> 01:29:47.280]   But one of the people that she talks about in the book
[01:29:47.280 --> 01:29:49.240]   is Jeff Bezos.
[01:29:49.240 --> 01:29:56.000]   And having this conversation about how he thinks so far ahead
[01:29:56.000 --> 01:30:01.040]   was really interesting and seeing what he's sort of--
[01:30:01.040 --> 01:30:04.200]   how he processes things and what--
[01:30:04.200 --> 01:30:06.720]   because a lot of people thought, OK, he's just really into books.
[01:30:06.720 --> 01:30:08.800]   And that's why it started with books.
[01:30:08.800 --> 01:30:10.440]   And it was so much more than just that.
[01:30:10.440 --> 01:30:11.440]   You're not going to give it away.
[01:30:11.440 --> 01:30:12.240]   Those are spoilers.
[01:30:12.240 --> 01:30:15.160]   So watch the interview when it comes out and get the book.
[01:30:15.160 --> 01:30:18.640]   But anyway, just to speak to that, like Jeff Bezos is--
[01:30:18.640 --> 01:30:19.920]   It's a different kind of brain.
[01:30:19.920 --> 01:30:22.240]   He is his smart guy.
[01:30:22.240 --> 01:30:27.200]   And he's got a space company to prove it.
[01:30:27.200 --> 01:30:28.160]   Let's take a quick break.
[01:30:28.160 --> 01:30:29.840]   Thank the sponsor of this episode.
[01:30:29.840 --> 01:30:31.760]   And then we'll get back into more.
[01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:34.880]   You guys can look and see what you want to talk about.
[01:30:34.880 --> 01:30:37.800]   And I'm going to thank CashFly for sponsoring
[01:30:37.800 --> 01:30:39.840]   this episode of This Week in Tech.
[01:30:39.840 --> 01:30:41.240]   We love CashFly around here.
[01:30:41.240 --> 01:30:44.280]   Twit really just wouldn't be Twit without CashFly,
[01:30:44.280 --> 01:30:48.160]   because we've had CashFly on our side for almost as long
[01:30:48.160 --> 01:30:49.480]   as we've existed.
[01:30:49.480 --> 01:30:51.800]   Give your users the seamless online experience
[01:30:51.800 --> 01:30:52.800]   that they want.
[01:30:52.800 --> 01:30:55.440]   Empower your site or app with CashFly CDN
[01:30:55.440 --> 01:30:57.880]   and be 30% faster than the competition.
[01:30:57.880 --> 01:31:03.360]   No matter what industry or business that you happen to be in,
[01:31:03.360 --> 01:31:05.800]   if your website is directly tied to company revenue,
[01:31:05.800 --> 01:31:07.640]   you can give your customers the fast downloads
[01:31:07.640 --> 01:31:09.600]   that they need with CashFly.
[01:31:09.600 --> 01:31:12.680]   CashFly CDN delivers rich media content up to 10 times
[01:31:12.680 --> 01:31:16.640]   faster than traditional delivery methods, up to 30%
[01:31:16.640 --> 01:31:19.520]   faster than other major CDNs.
[01:31:19.520 --> 01:31:21.880]   It's backed by a 100% SLA.
[01:31:21.880 --> 01:31:24.400]   CashFly guarantees the best user experience
[01:31:24.400 --> 01:31:26.960]   for all your customers, no matter where they are
[01:31:26.960 --> 01:31:28.680]   or what device they're on.
[01:31:28.680 --> 01:31:31.400]   Join the thousands of others who trust CashFly's reliable
[01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:35.960]   network, including LG, Microsoft, Adobe, and R's Technica.
[01:31:35.960 --> 01:31:39.280]   Of course, like I said, we've been hosting our podcasts
[01:31:39.280 --> 01:31:41.360]   on CashFly for a decade.
[01:31:41.360 --> 01:31:43.560]   We love them every month.
[01:31:43.560 --> 01:31:49.000]   We deliver just tons of petabytes of video, of audio,
[01:31:49.000 --> 01:31:50.320]   to all of you.
[01:31:50.320 --> 01:31:52.440]   Fast, it's flawless.
[01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:56.480]   Twit just wouldn't be Twit without the help of CashFly.
[01:31:56.480 --> 01:31:57.200]   On the back end.
[01:31:57.200 --> 01:32:00.040]   So say goodbye to logging in multiple times a week
[01:32:00.040 --> 01:32:03.720]   or worse even daily trying to track your CDN usage.
[01:32:03.720 --> 01:32:05.280]   You're not going to see any billing spikes.
[01:32:05.280 --> 01:32:08.960]   You'll get a custom plan that's tailored to your CDN needs
[01:32:08.960 --> 01:32:12.000]   based on yearly usage trends.
[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:14.200]   And on average, customers who switch to CashFly
[01:32:14.200 --> 01:32:16.360]   save more than 20%.
[01:32:16.360 --> 01:32:18.440]   And you can imagine what you could do with that 20%
[01:32:18.440 --> 01:32:19.760]   and your time.
[01:32:19.760 --> 01:32:21.640]   And just for Twit listeners, CashFly's
[01:32:21.640 --> 01:32:24.360]   giving away a complimentary detailed analysis
[01:32:24.360 --> 01:32:27.720]   of your current CDN bill and usage trends.
[01:32:27.720 --> 01:32:31.960]   So you can see if you're overpaying 20% or more for CDN.
[01:32:31.960 --> 01:32:35.480]   You can learn more by going to twit.cashfly.com.
[01:32:35.480 --> 01:32:38.120]   That's twit.cashfly.com.
[01:32:38.120 --> 01:32:41.240]   And we thank CashFly for their support,
[01:32:41.240 --> 01:32:45.000]   for their continuing support here at Twit.
[01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:45.520]   All right.
[01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:46.600]   All right.
[01:32:46.600 --> 01:32:47.120]   All right.
[01:32:47.120 --> 01:32:48.400]   What you got in the Apple world?
[01:32:48.400 --> 01:32:52.880]   Well, there was a little bit of a news story earlier
[01:32:52.880 --> 01:32:59.000]   about Apple Pay becoming the most popular mobile payment
[01:32:59.000 --> 01:33:00.400]   platform in the United States.
[01:33:00.400 --> 01:33:03.920]   So you know about Google Play, not Google Play.
[01:33:03.920 --> 01:33:04.920]   You know about Google Pay?
[01:33:04.920 --> 01:33:05.360]   Google Play.
[01:33:05.360 --> 01:33:06.920]   Yeah, I do know about it.
[01:33:06.920 --> 01:33:08.160]   It's irregularly.
[01:33:08.160 --> 01:33:09.920]   You know about Apple Pay.
[01:33:09.920 --> 01:33:12.840]   But do you know what was the most popular and has been
[01:33:12.840 --> 01:33:16.360]   the most popular payment platform in the United States?
[01:33:16.360 --> 01:33:17.080]   That would be--
[01:33:17.080 --> 01:33:18.560]   Dun, dun, dun, dun.
[01:33:18.560 --> 01:33:19.200]   Hey, pal.
[01:33:19.200 --> 01:33:20.280]   Starbucks.
[01:33:20.280 --> 01:33:21.000]   What?
[01:33:21.000 --> 01:33:23.680]   Starbucks has, for the longest time,
[01:33:23.680 --> 01:33:27.840]   been an incredibly popular payment platform.
[01:33:27.840 --> 01:33:31.680]   And in fact, it was so popular that--
[01:33:31.680 --> 01:33:34.000]   and this was, I think, at a Starbucks earning report.
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:36.240]   And I wish I could remember the numbers.
[01:33:36.240 --> 01:33:38.440]   This was a story that I wrote a long time ago about it.
[01:33:38.440 --> 01:33:41.560]   But they had some ridiculous number,
[01:33:41.560 --> 01:33:46.120]   like every six mobile payment charges in the United States
[01:33:46.120 --> 01:33:47.160]   are Starbucks.
[01:33:47.160 --> 01:33:48.840]   Every six seconds, they're a blank amount.
[01:33:48.840 --> 01:33:49.680]   You know what I mean?
[01:33:49.680 --> 01:33:53.000]   They're a huge number, ridiculous number.
[01:33:53.000 --> 01:33:56.280]   So Starbucks had been building out this platform
[01:33:56.280 --> 01:34:00.120]   to make it easy for people to get their coffee.
[01:34:00.120 --> 01:34:05.520]   And suddenly, folks realized that this coffee company
[01:34:05.520 --> 01:34:08.000]   and their mobile payment platform
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:10.320]   was an excellent sort of case study
[01:34:10.320 --> 01:34:15.120]   on creating their own versions of mobile payment.
[01:34:15.120 --> 01:34:18.760]   And so folks have kind of looked to Starbucks
[01:34:18.760 --> 01:34:19.800]   for a long time.
[01:34:19.800 --> 01:34:20.960]   Where infrastructure--
[01:34:20.960 --> 01:34:22.440]   yeah, they're infrastructure the way
[01:34:22.440 --> 01:34:27.360]   that they set things up, the pitfalls and those kinds of things.
[01:34:27.360 --> 01:34:32.960]   But now, we've got Apple Pay overtaking the payment platform.
[01:34:32.960 --> 01:34:36.840]   And I'm curious if this is a matter
[01:34:36.840 --> 01:34:40.720]   of the ongoing pervasiveness of tap
[01:34:40.720 --> 01:34:44.240]   to pay functionality in the United States
[01:34:44.240 --> 01:34:50.040]   or if this is a popularity with Apple Pay in general.
[01:34:50.040 --> 01:34:50.640]   If that makes sense.
[01:34:50.640 --> 01:34:52.960]   Because it was easy for Starbucks
[01:34:52.960 --> 01:34:56.720]   to be the top mobile payment platform in a world
[01:34:56.720 --> 01:34:59.960]   where Starbucks was one of the only places
[01:34:59.960 --> 01:35:00.960]   where you could do the mobile payments.
[01:35:00.960 --> 01:35:02.040]   Right, with the phone.
[01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:02.720]   Yeah.
[01:35:02.720 --> 01:35:07.560]   But now, as we continue to expand this technology,
[01:35:07.560 --> 01:35:09.120]   more and more places are getting the tap
[01:35:09.120 --> 01:35:10.400]   to pay functionality finally.
[01:35:10.400 --> 01:35:12.560]   And I know this is almost entirely
[01:35:12.560 --> 01:35:15.360]   a uniquely American experience where everywhere else everybody's
[01:35:15.360 --> 01:35:16.160]   got tap to pay.
[01:35:16.160 --> 01:35:16.680]   Yeah.
[01:35:16.680 --> 01:35:17.960]   I'm like, where have you been?
[01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:20.840]   Yeah, what year is this?
[01:35:20.840 --> 01:35:22.920]   Yeah, in fact, we've already got in the chat.
[01:35:22.920 --> 01:35:25.120]   I've been doing it for years.
[01:35:25.120 --> 01:35:31.640]   But it is-- so I'm curious, do you two use tap to pay functionality?
[01:35:31.640 --> 01:35:35.320]   I don't because on the Android side, I never had any--
[01:35:35.320 --> 01:35:37.480]   I never had a high enough success rate.
[01:35:37.480 --> 01:35:39.920]   It was just too-- it just drove me nuts.
[01:35:39.920 --> 01:35:41.560]   So I just gave up on it.
[01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:43.080]   Because you remember Google Wallet?
[01:35:43.080 --> 01:35:44.080]   Was that what it was called?
[01:35:44.080 --> 01:35:44.400]   Oh, yeah.
[01:35:44.400 --> 01:35:45.840]   That was one of its many names.
[01:35:45.840 --> 01:35:48.440]   You know, Google Wallet, and it touted
[01:35:48.440 --> 01:35:51.240]   having all of these capabilities within FC and whatnot.
[01:35:51.240 --> 01:35:52.240]   And you go and set it up.
[01:35:52.240 --> 01:35:55.080]   And either you go into the merchant
[01:35:55.080 --> 01:35:56.560]   and the merchant would look at you like,
[01:35:56.560 --> 01:35:58.520]   I don't know what Google Wallet is.
[01:35:58.520 --> 01:35:59.560]   So that was one battle.
[01:35:59.560 --> 01:36:02.720]   And then if they did accept some type of tap to pay,
[01:36:02.720 --> 01:36:04.720]   you put it on there and it just stare at you.
[01:36:04.720 --> 01:36:05.720]   Oh, no.
[01:36:05.720 --> 01:36:07.600]   You know, it just--
[01:36:07.600 --> 01:36:10.000]   whatever that chime was, and then it just
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:12.160]   sit there and look at you, it was so unreliable.
[01:36:12.160 --> 01:36:13.560]   So I gave up on it.
[01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:18.680]   But I always would see iPhone users doing it just easily.
[01:36:18.680 --> 01:36:21.080]   So I just assumed it was just another one of those fragmentation
[01:36:21.080 --> 01:36:22.840]   issues with the Android platforms.
[01:36:22.840 --> 01:36:23.720]   And screw it.
[01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:24.240]   Yeah.
[01:36:24.240 --> 01:36:27.320]   Yeah, and I completely--
[01:36:27.320 --> 01:36:29.760]   I'm right there with you for the longest time.
[01:36:29.760 --> 01:36:31.960]   Google Wallet, and then it was Android Pay.
[01:36:31.960 --> 01:36:34.760]   Android Pay, that was Google Pay.
[01:36:34.760 --> 01:36:36.920]   For the longest time, I wouldn't use it for the very same reason.
[01:36:36.920 --> 01:36:38.880]   It was not a high enough--
[01:36:38.880 --> 01:36:43.400]   like, for me, a digital wallet only makes sense for me.
[01:36:43.400 --> 01:36:45.160]   If I have enough confidence in it,
[01:36:45.160 --> 01:36:46.800]   then I can leave my wallet at home.
[01:36:46.800 --> 01:36:47.320]   Right.
[01:36:47.320 --> 01:36:48.960]   And I know 100% it's going to work.
[01:36:48.960 --> 01:36:51.640]   Because what sucks more than going to the store,
[01:36:51.640 --> 01:36:55.080]   filling my cart with groceries, and getting the only thing I
[01:36:55.080 --> 01:36:56.800]   have is digital and it doesn't work.
[01:36:56.800 --> 01:36:57.320]   Right.
[01:36:57.320 --> 01:36:58.240]   That's a problem.
[01:36:58.240 --> 01:36:59.080]   And that's a nice thing.
[01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:01.400]   I have had that experience.
[01:37:01.400 --> 01:37:04.840]   And so one of those experiences was enough for me
[01:37:04.840 --> 01:37:07.600]   to just not trust it anymore and to stop.
[01:37:07.600 --> 01:37:11.040]   Now, since then, with Android-- sorry, with Google Pay.
[01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:12.760]   See, I can't even keep it straight.
[01:37:12.760 --> 01:37:15.040]   It's a new name every two years.
[01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:19.160]   Since then, I've gotten better at setting it up on new phones,
[01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:21.280]   because I also test a lot of devices.
[01:37:21.280 --> 01:37:23.960]   And every time I do that, I have to log in and then verify
[01:37:23.960 --> 01:37:25.200]   the cards that are associated with--
[01:37:25.200 --> 01:37:25.960]   Yes, you do.
[01:37:25.960 --> 01:37:26.800]   And if I was--
[01:37:26.800 --> 01:37:27.280]   Right.
[01:37:27.280 --> 01:37:29.560]   And that makes sense as part of the security and verification
[01:37:29.560 --> 01:37:30.080]   process.
[01:37:30.080 --> 01:37:31.800]   So I understand.
[01:37:31.800 --> 01:37:33.960]   But there were many times where I wouldn't remember to do that.
[01:37:33.960 --> 01:37:35.760]   And then I go somewhere and be like, I'm going to use it.
[01:37:35.760 --> 01:37:38.360]   And I pull it out and I hadn't completed the verification
[01:37:38.360 --> 01:37:39.600]   so I couldn't do it.
[01:37:39.600 --> 01:37:40.100]   Yeah.
[01:37:40.100 --> 01:37:41.840]   Now I'm getting better at doing that.
[01:37:41.840 --> 01:37:45.200]   And since doing that, I've had really good success with it.
[01:37:45.200 --> 01:37:49.160]   So when I do go to Whole Foods or the grocery store,
[01:37:49.160 --> 01:37:51.400]   I will opt more for it.
[01:37:51.400 --> 01:37:53.760]   But I don't know that it makes anything that much easier,
[01:37:53.760 --> 01:37:54.760]   to be honest.
[01:37:54.760 --> 01:37:55.260]   Yeah.
[01:37:55.260 --> 01:37:58.600]   It's really easy for me to pull out my card and tap it, too.
[01:37:58.600 --> 01:38:02.520]   Here in the success story of how popular Starbucks was,
[01:38:02.520 --> 01:38:06.000]   that it's mind-boggling just because of my personal experience.
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:08.920]   I'm like, man, it was that many people with Starbucks.
[01:38:08.920 --> 01:38:13.040]   And it's just this many per hour or whatever that step was.
[01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:14.520]   It boggles my mind.
[01:38:14.520 --> 01:38:18.000]   So with you and Apple pay being an Apple guy,
[01:38:18.000 --> 01:38:19.920]   are you comfortable leaving your wallet at home?
[01:38:19.920 --> 01:38:22.080]   Is it that reliable for you for your experience?
[01:38:22.080 --> 01:38:25.560]   So I have a storied history with it as well.
[01:38:25.560 --> 01:38:27.080]   In the beginning.
[01:38:27.080 --> 01:38:28.080]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:38:28.080 --> 01:38:29.360]   In the world.
[01:38:29.360 --> 01:38:33.400]   I was afraid to use it because I didn't want
[01:38:33.400 --> 01:38:36.360]   to have that experience where it failed on me.
[01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:38.920]   I didn't want to go into the store and be that person that
[01:38:38.920 --> 01:38:40.800]   is trying to get it to work and it's not working.
[01:38:40.800 --> 01:38:42.760]   So for the longest time, I did not use it.
[01:38:42.760 --> 01:38:46.880]   The other thing was that living in the Midwest,
[01:38:46.880 --> 01:38:48.120]   not every place had it.
[01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:49.080]   There were only a few places.
[01:38:49.080 --> 01:38:51.520]   And so it wasn't worth trying to figure out when--
[01:38:51.520 --> 01:38:53.040]   That's how it was with me in the South.
[01:38:53.040 --> 01:38:55.200]   It was like most people would look at you crazy.
[01:38:55.200 --> 01:38:56.720]   Like, I don't know what the heck you're talking about.
[01:38:56.720 --> 01:38:57.220]   Right.
[01:38:57.220 --> 01:38:58.160]   And that was the other thing, too,
[01:38:58.160 --> 01:39:00.920]   is when I did use it and it did work OK,
[01:39:00.920 --> 01:39:03.040]   then there were the weird looks and stuff.
[01:39:03.040 --> 01:39:07.480]   And so finally, I just said, you know what?
[01:39:07.480 --> 01:39:08.360]   I'm just going to try it.
[01:39:08.360 --> 01:39:09.080]   I'm going to use it.
[01:39:09.080 --> 01:39:10.480]   I'm going to see how this works.
[01:39:10.480 --> 01:39:11.840]   And it was actually Walgreens that
[01:39:11.840 --> 01:39:15.600]   was my kickoff for being really into it.
[01:39:15.600 --> 01:39:18.280]   And that's because Walgreens does this fantastic thing
[01:39:18.280 --> 01:39:23.840]   where not only can you pay with your card, whatever debit
[01:39:23.840 --> 01:39:26.160]   card or credit card you have linked to, Apple Pay.
[01:39:26.160 --> 01:39:30.000]   But at the same time, it also swipes your rewards card
[01:39:30.000 --> 01:39:30.800]   with Walgreens.
[01:39:30.800 --> 01:39:31.320]   Oh, nice.
[01:39:31.320 --> 01:39:31.960]   Both at the same time.
[01:39:31.960 --> 01:39:32.760]   It all is.
[01:39:32.760 --> 01:39:33.360]   Yeah.
[01:39:33.360 --> 01:39:35.200]   So then you get those points and everything.
[01:39:35.200 --> 01:39:37.000]   And so I started to use it there.
[01:39:37.000 --> 01:39:40.560]   But I didn't really have the aha moment
[01:39:40.560 --> 01:39:42.440]   until I got it on my watch.
[01:39:42.440 --> 01:39:43.320]   OK.
[01:39:43.320 --> 01:39:45.440]   Now I don't have to take out my phone even.
[01:39:45.440 --> 01:39:46.760]   I don't have to take out my wallet.
[01:39:46.760 --> 01:39:50.320]   I double tap this button and go like this, and it's done.
[01:39:50.320 --> 01:39:51.280]   And it's so quick.
[01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:52.120]   It's so fast.
[01:39:52.120 --> 01:39:54.800]   There's not all these weird gestures I'm having to do.
[01:39:54.800 --> 01:39:57.680]   Or look at my phone and get it to unlock none of that.
[01:39:57.680 --> 01:40:00.560]   I double tap, and I hit that, and it's done.
[01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:01.680]   And so now I do this everywhere.
[01:40:01.680 --> 01:40:03.160]   I mean, everywhere here pretty much
[01:40:03.160 --> 01:40:05.000]   has tapped to pay functionality.
[01:40:05.000 --> 01:40:06.000]   Yeah, you're in a good place.
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:06.520]   Right.
[01:40:06.520 --> 01:40:08.040]   And in fact, there have been a few times
[01:40:08.040 --> 01:40:14.080]   where I have gone to the store, and I didn't show a little
[01:40:14.080 --> 01:40:16.200]   tap to pay icon or anything.
[01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:18.240]   And so I've gone through with my normal payment method.
[01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:20.640]   And then later on, it's like, use Apple Pay or this
[01:40:20.640 --> 01:40:21.240]   or that or the other.
[01:40:21.240 --> 01:40:22.640]   And I was like darn it, I couldn't use them.
[01:40:22.640 --> 01:40:23.640]   That is so much faster.
[01:40:23.640 --> 01:40:26.000]   And pulling out my wallet, finding the card,
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:29.080]   sticking it in, typing in the pin, all that kind of stuff.
[01:40:29.080 --> 01:40:30.760]   So now I do use it quite a bit.
[01:40:30.760 --> 01:40:33.640]   And I can see why I think that you're
[01:40:33.640 --> 01:40:34.840]   right about the fragmentation.
[01:40:34.840 --> 01:40:40.680]   I think this is a technology that has to work as close
[01:40:40.680 --> 01:40:42.880]   to policy as possible, or people aren't
[01:40:42.880 --> 01:40:44.400]   going to want to use it.
[01:40:44.400 --> 01:40:46.560]   Because I don't think really anybody
[01:40:46.560 --> 01:40:48.480]   wants to be that person.
[01:40:48.480 --> 01:40:50.360]   Holding up the line.
[01:40:50.360 --> 01:40:51.960]   Nobody wants to be that person holding up the line.
[01:40:51.960 --> 01:40:55.720]   Nobody, at least among nerds who were the early adopters of this,
[01:40:55.720 --> 01:40:57.800]   nobody wants to be that nerd who looks like they
[01:40:57.800 --> 01:40:59.920]   don't know how to use their technology.
[01:40:59.920 --> 01:41:01.840]   And so you had this whole--
[01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:03.560]   The chat room will shame us for that.
[01:41:03.560 --> 01:41:04.080]   Right?
[01:41:04.080 --> 01:41:04.960]   Who would have liked it?
[01:41:04.960 --> 01:41:07.520]   So there were multiple, I think, barriers
[01:41:07.520 --> 01:41:10.160]   to have to climb over to get this to be something that
[01:41:10.160 --> 01:41:12.160]   could overtake Starbucks.
[01:41:12.160 --> 01:41:15.160]   And now it's dog on done it.
[01:41:15.160 --> 01:41:17.600]   So are you leaving your wallet at home now?
[01:41:17.600 --> 01:41:20.000]   I do sometimes.
[01:41:20.000 --> 01:41:20.800]   Well, no, no.
[01:41:20.800 --> 01:41:24.680]   Let me try again, because I always have to bring my driver's
[01:41:24.680 --> 01:41:25.680]   license.
[01:41:25.680 --> 01:41:26.480]   So my wallet doesn't stay at home.
[01:41:26.480 --> 01:41:27.480]   I leave my phone at home.
[01:41:27.480 --> 01:41:28.800]   OK, well, let me rephrase that.
[01:41:28.800 --> 01:41:33.200]   Are you comfortable enough with leaving your payment source
[01:41:33.200 --> 01:41:34.640]   in the car or what have you?
[01:41:34.640 --> 01:41:35.160]   Yes.
[01:41:35.160 --> 01:41:36.120]   And it's just going into the store.
[01:41:36.120 --> 01:41:39.240]   I have gone into the store with just my watch on.
[01:41:39.240 --> 01:41:39.880]   Yeah.
[01:41:39.880 --> 01:41:40.360]   I leave my phone--
[01:41:40.360 --> 01:41:41.640]   I wouldn't even think twice about it.
[01:41:41.640 --> 01:41:42.480]   --in the car, yeah.
[01:41:42.480 --> 01:41:42.920]   Because--
[01:41:42.920 --> 01:41:44.000]   That says a lot.
[01:41:44.000 --> 01:41:45.960]   I mean, it genuinely has not failed me.
[01:41:45.960 --> 01:41:47.200]   Now, of course, there's probably
[01:41:47.200 --> 01:41:49.640]   going to be some time where there are a tap to pay us down.
[01:41:49.640 --> 01:41:51.680]   It'll be like, oh, well, I'll be back.
[01:41:51.680 --> 01:41:52.640]   I've got to go get my card.
[01:41:52.640 --> 01:41:54.920]   But I've not had that be an issue.
[01:41:54.920 --> 01:41:56.040]   That says a lot, though.
[01:41:56.040 --> 01:41:58.960]   You just second nature, just leave it in there
[01:41:58.960 --> 01:42:00.560]   and go and do what you need to do.
[01:42:00.560 --> 01:42:02.360]   And in fact, I feel nowhere near there.
[01:42:02.360 --> 01:42:04.960]   Because I would--
[01:42:04.960 --> 01:42:06.200]   this has only happened to me once,
[01:42:06.200 --> 01:42:10.320]   but I was in a hardware store and was getting some wood
[01:42:10.320 --> 01:42:12.200]   for a project that I was working on and--
[01:42:12.200 --> 01:42:13.880]   It was built in widgets.
[01:42:13.880 --> 01:42:16.200]   I was remodeling my grandma's bathroom.
[01:42:16.200 --> 01:42:19.560]   And somehow, my wallet fell out of my pocket.
[01:42:19.560 --> 01:42:21.640]   I don't even know how it happened.
[01:42:21.640 --> 01:42:25.720]   I'm not a person who usually loses those kinds of things.
[01:42:25.720 --> 01:42:29.520]   And so it really threw me off my game when it happened.
[01:42:29.520 --> 01:42:32.720]   And so now I think about that sometimes.
[01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:34.480]   I'm like, you know where it's safe and where
[01:42:34.480 --> 01:42:35.880]   I don't have to worry about it getting lost?
[01:42:35.880 --> 01:42:38.360]   Is if I leave it in the car, in the glove compartment
[01:42:38.360 --> 01:42:40.120]   or whatever.
[01:42:40.120 --> 01:42:42.280]   Now, don't break into my car.
[01:42:42.280 --> 01:42:43.280]   You're stealing it.
[01:42:43.280 --> 01:42:44.480]   Too much, too much, everybody.
[01:42:44.480 --> 01:42:44.960]   Yeah, stealing it.
[01:42:44.960 --> 01:42:47.360]   I was also going to tag onto that.
[01:42:47.360 --> 01:42:51.440]   That my reuse, my resurgence into using it,
[01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:54.520]   actually came out of necessity going to the store.
[01:42:54.520 --> 01:42:56.120]   Realizing I didn't have my wallet.
[01:42:56.120 --> 01:42:56.600]   Whoops.
[01:42:56.600 --> 01:42:57.320]   Thinking I had it.
[01:42:57.320 --> 01:42:59.440]   It was like, well, what am I going to do?
[01:42:59.440 --> 01:43:00.640]   And it turned out it worked.
[01:43:00.640 --> 01:43:01.640]   And I was like, oh, wait a minute.
[01:43:01.640 --> 01:43:04.120]   OK, so this is kind of nice.
[01:43:04.120 --> 01:43:05.360]   It saved the day in that.
[01:43:05.360 --> 01:43:07.280]   You threw yourself into the fire, essentially.
[01:43:07.280 --> 01:43:07.920]   Exactly.
[01:43:07.920 --> 01:43:11.160]   So sometimes it just takes a little reason
[01:43:11.160 --> 01:43:12.440]   to tip the scales.
[01:43:12.440 --> 01:43:15.920]   Yes, to tip the scales and put your toe back into the water
[01:43:15.920 --> 01:43:16.920]   and try it again.
[01:43:16.920 --> 01:43:18.320]   So pretty good.
[01:43:18.320 --> 01:43:18.800]   Pretty good.
[01:43:18.800 --> 01:43:20.120]   The other thing there--
[01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:22.200]   so I found this an interesting story.
[01:43:22.200 --> 01:43:23.520]   It's not just an Apple story.
[01:43:23.520 --> 01:43:25.960]   It's an everything story.
[01:43:25.960 --> 01:43:26.480]   But it's about--
[01:43:26.480 --> 01:43:28.640]   Sure he says.
[01:43:28.640 --> 01:43:30.280]   The Apple blogs were covering it.
[01:43:30.280 --> 01:43:32.960]   But there's a government bill out
[01:43:32.960 --> 01:43:35.480]   that-- well, they're working on this bill--
[01:43:35.480 --> 01:43:39.680]   that could see emergency alerts appearing
[01:43:39.680 --> 01:43:42.680]   in streamed services.
[01:43:42.680 --> 01:43:46.640]   So right now, or at least previously,
[01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:47.880]   you would be watching--
[01:43:47.880 --> 01:43:50.600]   in Missouri, we would get tornadoes.
[01:43:50.600 --> 01:43:52.680]   And that was a regular occurrence.
[01:43:52.680 --> 01:43:55.440]   And so I can remember during tornado season,
[01:43:55.440 --> 01:43:57.000]   you'd be watching TV.
[01:43:57.000 --> 01:43:59.760]   And the tornado sounds would be going out outside.
[01:43:59.760 --> 01:44:02.920]   But then the television would also do this like, bah, bah.
[01:44:02.920 --> 01:44:05.760]   And then you get the emergency broadcast service, blah, blah,
[01:44:05.760 --> 01:44:06.120]   blah, blah.
[01:44:06.120 --> 01:44:07.720]   The message would come through.
[01:44:07.720 --> 01:44:09.400]   Now a lot of us are cord cutters.
[01:44:09.400 --> 01:44:12.960]   A lot of us are even maybe TV lists.
[01:44:12.960 --> 01:44:17.520]   We don't necessarily have the same methods and ways
[01:44:17.520 --> 01:44:21.480]   of getting access to these security notifications.
[01:44:21.480 --> 01:44:25.000]   And so this bill is actually--
[01:44:25.000 --> 01:44:27.640]   I find it fascinating it was created to--
[01:44:27.640 --> 01:44:31.640]   or it was readjusted to help with the fact
[01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:34.920]   that we had that false bomb scare.
[01:44:34.920 --> 01:44:35.880]   What was in Hawaii, right?
[01:44:35.880 --> 01:44:37.120]   They had the missiles.
[01:44:37.120 --> 01:44:37.640]   Yeah.
[01:44:37.640 --> 01:44:41.200]   And so this-- the bill is kind of looking at that
[01:44:41.200 --> 01:44:43.280]   and looking at better ways to communicate
[01:44:43.280 --> 01:44:46.520]   and better ways to make sure that our emergency communications
[01:44:46.520 --> 01:44:48.160]   are set up properly.
[01:44:48.160 --> 01:44:52.400]   But with it comes the idea that streaming services, which
[01:44:52.400 --> 01:44:55.960]   we're all using these days, be it Netflix or Apple TV
[01:44:55.960 --> 01:45:02.520]   Plus or Apple Music, would play through an emergency alert.
[01:45:02.520 --> 01:45:05.720]   Now there are some people who would work.
[01:45:05.720 --> 01:45:06.200]   That's--
[01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:06.760]   That would be delivered.
[01:45:06.760 --> 01:45:08.080]   That's going to be a--
[01:45:08.080 --> 01:45:09.320]   government says do this.
[01:45:09.320 --> 01:45:11.880]   Companies have to figure out how to implement it kind of thing.
[01:45:11.880 --> 01:45:14.280]   So you're watching your Netflix show.
[01:45:14.280 --> 01:45:17.120]   And then suddenly it just pauses and a message appears
[01:45:17.120 --> 01:45:17.880]   over the top.
[01:45:17.880 --> 01:45:18.400]   Yeah.
[01:45:18.400 --> 01:45:21.000]   I mean, I don't even know if they've sort of figured out
[01:45:21.000 --> 01:45:22.760]   the exact scope of things.
[01:45:22.760 --> 01:45:25.560]   This seems more like a, hey, we want to implement
[01:45:25.560 --> 01:45:26.840]   this technology.
[01:45:26.840 --> 01:45:28.600]   Or we want this to happen.
[01:45:28.600 --> 01:45:32.280]   It's your job to follow regulations to make that work.
[01:45:32.280 --> 01:45:34.080]   I just wonder when we'll see--
[01:45:34.080 --> 01:45:34.600]   Yeah.
[01:45:34.600 --> 01:45:36.400]   I wonder when we'll see a pushback on that,
[01:45:36.400 --> 01:45:38.400]   because I'm sure that's a pretty big effort.
[01:45:38.400 --> 01:45:39.400]   Oh, I'm sure.
[01:45:39.400 --> 01:45:40.400]   Oh, for sure.
[01:45:40.400 --> 01:45:43.000]   It would be some effort to code that.
[01:45:43.000 --> 01:45:46.680]   And so this is what my question was for the two of you,
[01:45:46.680 --> 01:45:50.520]   because I don't know how to feel about this.
[01:45:50.520 --> 01:45:52.360]   Because there's a part of me who--
[01:45:52.360 --> 01:45:58.240]   there have been times where I have realized I don't watch
[01:45:58.240 --> 01:46:02.600]   like local news or have access, easy access to local news.
[01:46:02.600 --> 01:46:04.760]   And so I might not know what's going on locally
[01:46:04.760 --> 01:46:07.520]   and what I should be watching out for.
[01:46:07.520 --> 01:46:10.480]   And with that, it was like, they're
[01:46:10.480 --> 01:46:13.200]   going to have a way to sort of have
[01:46:13.200 --> 01:46:17.400]   that stuff available regardless of whether my internet was--
[01:46:17.400 --> 01:46:18.840]   well, in this case, you wouldn't need internet.
[01:46:18.840 --> 01:46:22.720]   But regardless of whether I've got the cable hooked up
[01:46:22.720 --> 01:46:24.120]   and all that kind of stuff.
[01:46:24.120 --> 01:46:28.400]   And so in that sense, I think this is a great idea
[01:46:28.400 --> 01:46:31.520]   if folks who are in cord cutters and all that kind of thing
[01:46:31.520 --> 01:46:34.640]   can gain access to these alerts.
[01:46:34.640 --> 01:46:37.920]   But then there's the other side of me that's like,
[01:46:37.920 --> 01:46:41.040]   don't mess with my system.
[01:46:41.040 --> 01:46:46.640]   Don't mess with the devices that I have and my personal--
[01:46:46.640 --> 01:46:49.640]   I pay for Netflix and I don't want you
[01:46:49.640 --> 01:46:51.520]   to interrupt my stream or whatever.
[01:46:51.520 --> 01:46:53.880]   There's a small part of me that feels that way too.
[01:46:53.880 --> 01:46:54.720]   It feels like approaching.
[01:46:54.720 --> 01:46:56.480]   You also page your cell phone bill, though.
[01:46:56.480 --> 01:46:57.080]   Yes.
[01:46:57.080 --> 01:46:59.040]   And you can still get alerts on that.
[01:46:59.040 --> 01:47:00.000]   Yes, that's true.
[01:47:00.000 --> 01:47:01.400]   But I can turn them off.
[01:47:01.400 --> 01:47:02.280]   So I wonder if--
[01:47:02.280 --> 01:47:02.840]   Yeah, that's that.
[01:47:02.840 --> 01:47:05.760]   And that's interesting that we have the ability to do that.
[01:47:05.760 --> 01:47:08.040]   I wonder if in these situations you would also
[01:47:08.040 --> 01:47:09.360]   have the ability to disable it.
[01:47:09.360 --> 01:47:10.360]   Opt out.
[01:47:10.360 --> 01:47:11.320]   But you're right about that.
[01:47:11.320 --> 01:47:13.760]   I'm just curious, from your own perspective,
[01:47:13.760 --> 01:47:18.200]   do you have any of either of those points of view,
[01:47:18.200 --> 01:47:20.040]   do you feel weird about them encroaching?
[01:47:20.040 --> 01:47:22.720]   Or do you feel like this is a good thing overall?
[01:47:22.720 --> 01:47:25.240]   For me, personally, I don't feel weird about it.
[01:47:25.240 --> 01:47:27.320]   I feel like if I was watching something on my TV
[01:47:27.320 --> 01:47:28.800]   and there was something--
[01:47:28.800 --> 01:47:31.200]   I mean, let's put it into terms we can understand.
[01:47:31.200 --> 01:47:33.480]   We're watching something and the fire--
[01:47:33.480 --> 01:47:36.600]   the fields are on fire, the mountains on fire,
[01:47:36.600 --> 01:47:38.160]   and it's coming towards my house.
[01:47:38.160 --> 01:47:41.360]   Whatever it takes for me to know that, I'm happy with it.
[01:47:41.360 --> 01:47:47.400]   So if it's pausing or putting up a message on my TV
[01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:51.200]   that tells me, hey, by the way, the fire's right around the corner,
[01:47:51.200 --> 01:47:52.080]   yeah, cool.
[01:47:52.080 --> 01:47:52.720]   Interrupt me.
[01:47:52.720 --> 01:47:53.920]   Let me know.
[01:47:53.920 --> 01:47:56.200]   My safety, I'm happy with that.
[01:47:56.200 --> 01:47:57.600]   I concur.
[01:47:57.600 --> 01:48:01.240]   Watching being a sports fan here on the Twit Network
[01:48:01.240 --> 01:48:03.320]   that seems like I'm the only one.
[01:48:03.320 --> 01:48:07.560]   Watching ball games, there's been a lot of times in the South
[01:48:07.560 --> 01:48:10.560]   where we get interrupted about hurricanes or tornadoes
[01:48:10.560 --> 01:48:12.680]   or what have you while we're watching the game.
[01:48:12.680 --> 01:48:14.040]   And I've grown accustomed to that.
[01:48:14.040 --> 01:48:15.960]   And it's always been-- well, I should say always--
[01:48:15.960 --> 01:48:16.440]   been useful.
[01:48:16.440 --> 01:48:20.360]   But most of the time, it's been useful information.
[01:48:20.360 --> 01:48:23.600]   But there are times when it's been pretty serious.
[01:48:23.600 --> 01:48:26.000]   You can think back to Hurricane Florence
[01:48:26.000 --> 01:48:28.840]   and how bad that was in my region.
[01:48:28.840 --> 01:48:32.680]   I'm glad something interrupted it to let folks know, hey,
[01:48:32.680 --> 01:48:35.560]   this hurricane is sitting on top of you right now.
[01:48:35.560 --> 01:48:38.160]   And you need to get out of there.
[01:48:38.160 --> 01:48:39.920]   So interrupt me.
[01:48:39.920 --> 01:48:40.600]   Yeah.
[01:48:40.600 --> 01:48:45.440]   Well, I guess one question I have for you guys is, do you--
[01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:46.280]   like I do.
[01:48:46.280 --> 01:48:49.240]   I unfortunately, I disabled that notification.
[01:48:49.240 --> 01:48:51.040]   No, I did not.
[01:48:51.040 --> 01:48:51.560]   No.
[01:48:51.560 --> 01:48:54.320]   I mean, as annoying as it could be at an--
[01:48:54.320 --> 01:48:57.440]   At least I think I do imagine that it transfers over.
[01:48:57.440 --> 01:48:59.640]   I know that I have and I know that I haven't.
[01:48:59.640 --> 01:49:00.800]   But I set up different phones.
[01:49:00.800 --> 01:49:02.640]   It's not something that I do on a regular basis.
[01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:03.240]   I've had it turned off.
[01:49:03.240 --> 01:49:05.360]   But I know that I have turned it off before.
[01:49:05.360 --> 01:49:11.600]   But since I had that moment, I was in southern Missouri
[01:49:11.600 --> 01:49:13.160]   and there was a tornado.
[01:49:13.160 --> 01:49:16.320]   And since I had that moment where I was like, man,
[01:49:16.320 --> 01:49:18.160]   it's a good thing I'm close to, sirens.
[01:49:18.160 --> 01:49:18.920]   I keep them on.
[01:49:18.920 --> 01:49:23.480]   I turned them on and have kept them on.
[01:49:23.480 --> 01:49:25.640]   Yeah.
[01:49:25.640 --> 01:49:26.560]   That's just a good way.
[01:49:26.560 --> 01:49:28.640]   I guess no matter where I am, I can get that notification.
[01:49:28.640 --> 01:49:30.320]   But we have a special service here.
[01:49:30.320 --> 01:49:31.880]   Is it Nixle?
[01:49:31.880 --> 01:49:32.400]   It is Nixle.
[01:49:32.400 --> 01:49:32.880]   Looks like that.
[01:49:32.880 --> 01:49:34.240]   I don't have a special to this location.
[01:49:34.240 --> 01:49:36.000]   But that's what I use now for.
[01:49:36.000 --> 01:49:36.880]   I realize what it is.
[01:49:36.880 --> 01:49:37.960]   I keep them on.
[01:49:37.960 --> 01:49:39.160]   I turn off the sound.
[01:49:39.160 --> 01:49:39.680]   Yes.
[01:49:39.680 --> 01:49:40.180]   Yes.
[01:49:40.180 --> 01:49:40.680]   OK.
[01:49:40.680 --> 01:49:41.240]   Sound I did say.
[01:49:41.240 --> 01:49:43.080]   I turn off the sound as well because--
[01:49:43.080 --> 01:49:43.840]   [SCREAMS]
[01:49:43.840 --> 01:49:44.340]   Yeah.
[01:49:44.340 --> 01:49:45.640]   We're in a restaurant.
[01:49:45.640 --> 01:49:48.400]   I don't-- I need that audible sound.
[01:49:48.400 --> 01:49:52.480]   I've had a situation where I missed the alert
[01:49:52.480 --> 01:49:53.880]   and we had a hurricane.
[01:49:53.880 --> 01:49:54.400]   Oh, wow.
[01:49:54.400 --> 01:49:56.400]   And I slept through it.
[01:49:56.400 --> 01:49:57.080]   Oh, my goodness.
[01:49:57.080 --> 01:50:00.880]   Woke up the next morning and we had large trees that were down.
[01:50:00.880 --> 01:50:06.320]   And I knew nothing about it because it just sounded like white noise
[01:50:06.320 --> 01:50:08.800]   to me with the whirling wind or whatever.
[01:50:08.800 --> 01:50:10.160]   But it was a hurricane.
[01:50:10.160 --> 01:50:11.160]   Holy moly.
[01:50:11.160 --> 01:50:15.280]   So yeah, I would have liked to have known to be prepared for that.
[01:50:15.280 --> 01:50:16.080]   Yeah.
[01:50:16.080 --> 01:50:17.760]   Indeed.
[01:50:17.760 --> 01:50:19.560]   Well, now after I've got all the anxiety,
[01:50:19.560 --> 01:50:21.480]   I think it's time to call all them down.
[01:50:21.480 --> 01:50:22.720]   It's time to call them down.
[01:50:22.720 --> 01:50:24.080]   Shall we call them down?
[01:50:24.080 --> 01:50:25.080]   Thank you.
[01:50:25.080 --> 01:50:25.600]   Thank you.
[01:50:25.600 --> 01:50:26.080]   Thank you.
[01:50:26.080 --> 01:50:27.600]   Thank you, Mom.
[01:50:27.600 --> 01:50:28.840]   Go ahead and meditate.
[01:50:28.840 --> 01:50:29.340]   Yes.
[01:50:29.340 --> 01:50:35.440]   You know, I love how everyone just assumes my voice is so calm here on twit.tv.
[01:50:35.440 --> 01:50:36.480]   It's not an assumption.
[01:50:36.480 --> 01:50:37.480]   It's an observation.
[01:50:37.480 --> 01:50:37.980]   It's true.
[01:50:37.980 --> 01:50:38.480]   All right.
[01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:38.480]   It's so true.
[01:50:38.480 --> 01:50:44.960]   We're going to thank our folks at calm for sponsoring this episode of This Week in Tech.
[01:50:44.960 --> 01:50:47.600]   Are you struggling to sleep these days?
[01:50:47.600 --> 01:50:49.200]   I'm pretty sure you are.
[01:50:49.200 --> 01:50:50.800]   Well, you're not alone.
[01:50:50.800 --> 01:50:55.120]   One in three of three US adults don't get enough sleep.
[01:50:55.120 --> 01:51:00.160]   And if you're not sleeping enough, it can really affect all of your cognitive functions
[01:51:00.160 --> 01:51:03.560]   and really screw up how things are going through your day.
[01:51:03.560 --> 01:51:07.800]   You're not going to be able to solve problems as easily decision making.
[01:51:07.800 --> 01:51:10.560]   It can really mess with you if you're not getting enough sleep.
[01:51:10.560 --> 01:51:16.280]   Trust me, Mr. Sergeant has really, really hammered this home to me each and every day
[01:51:16.280 --> 01:51:20.160]   about my sleep patterns.
[01:51:20.160 --> 01:51:24.320]   Sleep deficiency does some serious damage, folks, not just to your brain, but to your
[01:51:24.320 --> 01:51:25.920]   body as well.
[01:51:25.920 --> 01:51:30.440]   The sleep lists are more prone to accidents, weight gain and depression.
[01:51:30.440 --> 01:51:34.080]   So don't don't have sleepless nights in your lifestyle, folks.
[01:51:34.080 --> 01:51:39.280]   With calm, you can discover a whole library of programs designed to help you get better
[01:51:39.280 --> 01:51:42.920]   sleep and that your brain and body needs.
[01:51:42.920 --> 01:51:48.080]   Like soundscapes, over a hundred sleep stories and they're narrated by smooth soothing voices
[01:51:48.080 --> 01:51:53.960]   such as mine or Jerome Flynn from Game of Thrones and Steven Fry.
[01:51:53.960 --> 01:51:59.440]   So what you need to do is go ahead and seize the day and get yourself some great night's
[01:51:59.440 --> 01:52:01.840]   sleep using Calm.

[01:52:29.360 --> 01:52:31.080]   fuss at you.
[01:52:31.080 --> 01:52:33.280]   Thank you, Calm, for your support.
[01:52:33.280 --> 01:52:34.600]   Sleep is good.
[01:52:34.600 --> 01:52:35.920]   Sleep is, it's a good thing.
[01:52:35.920 --> 01:52:38.160]   At least that's what I've been told.
[01:52:38.160 --> 01:52:39.160]   Wow.
[01:52:39.160 --> 01:52:40.160]   True.
[01:52:40.160 --> 01:52:45.800]   I was just talking about that last night at Pep Calm because there was a company that's
[01:52:45.800 --> 01:52:49.520]   helping track sleep but they're doing it in a different way.
[01:52:49.520 --> 01:52:50.520]   Very differently.
[01:52:50.520 --> 01:52:51.520]   Yeah.
[01:52:51.520 --> 01:52:55.080]   You put this little device on your forehead and instead of it being just an accelerometer
[01:52:55.080 --> 01:53:02.000]   or something like that, it's looking at blood flow and by using that, it can determine
[01:53:02.000 --> 01:53:03.000]   a whole bunch of different things.
[01:53:03.000 --> 01:53:07.080]   So anyway, I was having a conversation with them and I started nerding out about sleep
[01:53:07.080 --> 01:53:10.400]   and sleep and dream science again.
[01:53:10.400 --> 01:53:12.080]   They started pushing him away.
[01:53:12.080 --> 01:53:13.080]   Oh, we're sure.
[01:53:13.080 --> 01:53:15.080]   He talked enough about sleep.
[01:53:15.080 --> 01:53:16.320]   It's a little much.
[01:53:16.320 --> 01:53:17.320]   We get it.
[01:53:17.320 --> 01:53:19.320]   You love to sleep.
[01:53:19.320 --> 01:53:20.320]   Right?
[01:53:20.320 --> 01:53:22.280]   So let's take a look here.
[01:53:22.280 --> 01:53:25.840]   We've got little bits and pieces from a bunch of different random directions.
[01:53:25.840 --> 01:53:30.640]   One of the things I thought was interesting was this Microsoft story.
[01:53:30.640 --> 01:53:36.880]   It's a VR experiment that Microsoft is doing called Dreamwalker.
[01:53:36.880 --> 01:53:40.720]   Basically, this is a VR rig.
[01:53:40.720 --> 01:53:43.720]   It's meant for wearing and then walking in the real world.
[01:53:43.720 --> 01:53:48.600]   So we're used to thinking of VR as this thing that we do in a room on our own so that no
[01:53:48.600 --> 01:53:50.640]   one can see how ridiculous we look.
[01:53:50.640 --> 01:53:51.640]   Right.
[01:53:51.640 --> 01:53:52.640]   And it's controlled space.
[01:53:52.640 --> 01:53:55.280]   You're not going to run into obstacles and everything.
[01:53:55.280 --> 01:54:00.120]   This is an experiment that apparently you put the user wears a VR rig.
[01:54:00.120 --> 01:54:06.840]   It includes a computer, goggles, a pair of RGB depth cameras, GPS, and then a smartphone
[01:54:06.840 --> 01:54:08.960]   for the mobile data connection.
[01:54:08.960 --> 01:54:14.080]   So you attach an entire office store or a radio shack to you?
[01:54:14.080 --> 01:54:17.240]   Yes, essentially in your backpack.
[01:54:17.240 --> 01:54:18.960]   And you hit the road.
[01:54:18.960 --> 01:54:24.600]   And basically, the software analyzes the route of where you're going and can help populate
[01:54:24.600 --> 01:54:30.760]   the real world that you are traveling through with a virtual world surrounded by virtual
[01:54:30.760 --> 01:54:36.680]   people that represent the real people that are surrounded.
[01:54:36.680 --> 01:54:41.840]   I mean, it boggles my mind why someone would want to do this.
[01:54:41.840 --> 01:54:43.720]   But it's interesting that you can.
[01:54:43.720 --> 01:54:46.600]   I immediately think of a very troubling thing.
[01:54:46.600 --> 01:54:51.640]   And that's like a white person who doesn't want to be surrounded by anyone other than
[01:54:51.640 --> 01:54:52.640]   other white people.
[01:54:52.640 --> 01:54:56.240]   Like they could make it so that all the people they're surrounded by are white in their own
[01:54:56.240 --> 01:54:57.240]   virtual space.
[01:54:57.240 --> 01:54:58.240]   Oh, wow.
[01:54:58.240 --> 01:54:59.240]   That's kind of sweet.
[01:54:59.240 --> 01:55:02.240]   All right.
[01:55:02.240 --> 01:55:04.240]   And less troubling, but still troubling.
[01:55:04.240 --> 01:55:06.560]   It's like a person who just doesn't like other humans.
[01:55:06.560 --> 01:55:08.120]   So it's like, I want to make everybody chicken.
[01:55:08.120 --> 01:55:11.280]   I want everybody to go away.
[01:55:11.280 --> 01:55:12.640]   Just so you could know where everybody is.
[01:55:12.640 --> 01:55:13.920]   Yeah, this is it.
[01:55:13.920 --> 01:55:14.920]   I see that.
[01:55:14.920 --> 01:55:18.760]   And I immediately think this is somebody that's not having a date tonight.
[01:55:18.760 --> 01:55:21.000]   Well, that would be true.
[01:55:21.000 --> 01:55:25.160]   I mean, yeah, if you are true.
[01:55:25.160 --> 01:55:29.160]   My first question is why Michael of the Good question.
[01:55:29.160 --> 01:55:31.840]   What is the point of that?
[01:55:31.840 --> 01:55:37.560]   It's funny that I saw this Miss Stacy Higginbotham brought it up on this week in Google.
[01:55:37.560 --> 01:55:38.560]   Yeah.
[01:55:38.560 --> 01:55:41.000]   And it made me just put a question out there on Twitter.
[01:55:41.000 --> 01:55:48.440]   I just flat out asked, yes or no, do you guys give a crap about AR and VR and the vast
[01:55:48.440 --> 01:55:55.040]   majority of my followers just said, no, simply no, because it's just not simple enough for
[01:55:55.040 --> 01:55:57.760]   people to just grasp onto it.
[01:55:57.760 --> 01:56:04.560]   And the people that did say yes, they thought more about, was it called the void or experiences?
[01:56:04.560 --> 01:56:05.560]   Yeah, experiences.
[01:56:05.560 --> 01:56:07.640]   They talked about that and that makes perfect sense.
[01:56:07.640 --> 01:56:11.840]   But just like this dude walking around here, nobody wants to do that.
[01:56:11.840 --> 01:56:13.440]   No, I don't believe that.
[01:56:13.440 --> 01:56:18.600]   We get people complaining about carrying a laptop because it's too heavy.
[01:56:18.600 --> 01:56:20.720]   Now you want to carry a whole rig.
[01:56:20.720 --> 01:56:21.720]   Yeah.
[01:56:21.720 --> 01:56:22.720]   Like what is this?
[01:56:22.720 --> 01:56:23.720]   Yeah.
[01:56:23.720 --> 01:56:24.720]   What is this?
[01:56:24.720 --> 01:56:27.400]   Because it's not augmented reality, but it kind of is.
[01:56:27.400 --> 01:56:31.160]   Because it's definitely a virtual reality that's based on it.
[01:56:31.160 --> 01:56:37.080]   I can't call it augmented because they're looking through devices, at least with augmented,
[01:56:37.080 --> 01:56:38.080]   you're still-
[01:56:38.080 --> 01:56:39.080]   You're seeing the real world.
[01:56:39.080 --> 01:56:40.640]   The real world.
[01:56:40.640 --> 01:56:44.840]   But this is an interpretation of the real world.
[01:56:44.840 --> 01:56:45.840]   But you're right.
[01:56:45.840 --> 01:56:48.360]   It's not, you're not actually seeing the building.
[01:56:48.360 --> 01:56:50.520]   You're seeing a digital version of the building.
[01:56:50.520 --> 01:56:56.360]   This fascinating technology, but again, the question is why do this for this particular
[01:56:56.360 --> 01:57:00.360]   modal, if it is?
[01:57:00.360 --> 01:57:03.000]   Just walking around with all of this gear on your back.
[01:57:03.000 --> 01:57:09.400]   This is for people who do not like the real reality and who would rather live in a virtual
[01:57:09.400 --> 01:57:10.400]   reality.
[01:57:10.400 --> 01:57:11.400]   Look, I'm not going to sit here and cling.
[01:57:11.400 --> 01:57:13.720]   That is genuinely why this experiment was done.
[01:57:13.720 --> 01:57:18.680]   So it says, "We explore a future in which people spend considerably more time in virtual
[01:57:18.680 --> 01:57:22.680]   reality, even during moments when they walk between locations in the real world."
[01:57:22.680 --> 01:57:26.320]   So this is looking at a way for someone to not ever have to leave the virtual reality
[01:57:26.320 --> 01:57:27.640]   they've put themselves in.
[01:57:27.640 --> 01:57:28.640]   Okay.
[01:57:28.640 --> 01:57:29.640]   All right.
[01:57:29.640 --> 01:57:30.640]   So let me put a different hat on.
[01:57:30.640 --> 01:57:31.640]   There are people that have phobias.
[01:57:31.640 --> 01:57:32.640]   Hold on.
[01:57:32.640 --> 01:57:33.640]   What does hat look like?
[01:57:33.640 --> 01:57:35.040]   Is this an app captain?
[01:57:35.040 --> 01:57:37.040]   It's usually orange and has a paw.
[01:57:37.040 --> 01:57:38.040]   How about that?
[01:57:38.040 --> 01:57:39.040]   Okay.
[01:57:39.040 --> 01:57:41.040]   Of course it is.
[01:57:41.040 --> 01:57:42.040]   Yeah.
[01:57:42.040 --> 01:57:43.040]   Yeah.
[01:57:43.040 --> 01:57:44.040]   Yeah.
[01:57:44.040 --> 01:57:49.200]   But let's think about the people with mental health issues and phobias.
[01:57:49.200 --> 01:57:50.920]   Maybe this is aimed towards them.
[01:57:50.920 --> 01:57:51.920]   Yeah.
[01:57:51.920 --> 01:57:54.360]   The next question is, is that really going to help?
[01:57:54.360 --> 01:57:57.480]   Is this therapeutic or is this- Or is it a band-aid?
[01:57:57.480 --> 01:58:01.480]   Is it isolating or what is it?
[01:58:01.480 --> 01:58:03.080]   I just find it interesting.
[01:58:03.080 --> 01:58:05.040]   I don't necessarily find it practical.
[01:58:05.040 --> 01:58:06.040]   No, no.
[01:58:06.040 --> 01:58:08.480]   And don't lie, this is your future.
[01:58:08.480 --> 01:58:15.240]   I know I've never claimed to be a people person, but I can't see myself isolating myself
[01:58:15.240 --> 01:58:16.240]   that way.
[01:58:16.240 --> 01:58:20.400]   I'd rather isolate myself in, I don't know, just not like that.
[01:58:20.400 --> 01:58:22.160]   Not with a big rig.
[01:58:22.160 --> 01:58:23.160]   Yeah.
[01:58:23.160 --> 01:58:28.760]   EGPU and power supply and probably carrying around a non-stank to keep it cool.
[01:58:28.760 --> 01:58:29.760]   Yeah.
[01:58:29.760 --> 01:58:30.760]   So like that.
[01:58:30.760 --> 01:58:31.760]   Listen to this.
[01:58:31.760 --> 01:58:33.400]   It is entirely, this is from the paper.
[01:58:33.400 --> 01:58:39.620]   It is entirely possible that future VR users may interrupt their VR sessions merely to accomplish
[01:58:39.620 --> 01:58:44.440]   real real world activities such as bathroom breaks are going to sleep.
[01:58:44.440 --> 01:58:47.680]   We also believe that future VR users- Not even to pay for the coffee?
[01:58:47.680 --> 01:58:52.080]   They'll still partake in real world experiences despite experiencing prolonged VR sessions.
[01:58:52.080 --> 01:58:56.120]   Until such a future arrives, people will at the very least retain the need to repeatedly
[01:58:56.120 --> 01:59:01.120]   visit various physical places, be it commuting to work, walking to the grocery store, traveling.
[01:59:01.120 --> 01:59:05.480]   So they're literally saying like, this is a future for people who want to just always
[01:59:05.480 --> 01:59:08.160]   be in virtual reality except when they need to use the restroom.
[01:59:08.160 --> 01:59:10.520]   So this is what we're creating to do that.
[01:59:10.520 --> 01:59:13.960]   Of course, this is more a thought experiment than anything else.
[01:59:13.960 --> 01:59:14.960]   Totally.
[01:59:14.960 --> 01:59:21.360]   Just because some researchers at Stanford and Microsoft are suggesting that this could
[01:59:21.360 --> 01:59:24.400]   be a potential future, it does not necessarily mean that has to be the case.
[01:59:24.400 --> 01:59:25.400]   That it will be.
[01:59:25.400 --> 01:59:28.720]   But what if this gets legs though?
[01:59:28.720 --> 01:59:30.720]   What are we promoting if this gets legs?
[01:59:30.720 --> 01:59:32.760]   Hey, I'm not promoting it.
[01:59:32.760 --> 01:59:33.760]   No.
[01:59:33.760 --> 01:59:36.040]   What are we promoting in society?
[01:59:36.040 --> 01:59:40.600]   If someone says, all right, I'm going to give you a quarter billion dollars to further
[01:59:40.600 --> 01:59:44.600]   this and get this thing off the ground and get it on the shelves so where people can
[01:59:44.600 --> 01:59:50.160]   buy it and put themselves in a position to walk down D Street here in Petaluma in a virtual
[01:59:50.160 --> 01:59:52.400]   world because they feel like it.
[01:59:52.400 --> 01:59:55.760]   What are we promoting with something like that?
[01:59:55.760 --> 01:59:57.840]   Well, I think we're promoting disconnection.
[01:59:57.840 --> 01:59:58.840]   All right.
[01:59:58.840 --> 02:00:01.040]   And I'm sure I'm going to get roasted for asking that question.
[02:00:01.040 --> 02:00:02.040]   No, I don't think-
[02:00:02.040 --> 02:00:03.040]   Yeah, I mean-
[02:00:03.040 --> 02:00:14.680]   To me, if someone feels the need to do that, I guess that's not my place to tell them that
[02:00:14.680 --> 02:00:15.680]   they can't.
[02:00:15.680 --> 02:00:16.680]   Sure.
[02:00:16.680 --> 02:00:22.400]   But I get like at the same time, I think the important thing is looking at the impact,
[02:00:22.400 --> 02:00:24.320]   the social impact this could have.
[02:00:24.320 --> 02:00:25.320]   Right.
[02:00:25.320 --> 02:00:26.760]   And everybody's walking around with these things.
[02:00:26.760 --> 02:00:28.560]   How does that improve or effect?
[02:00:28.560 --> 02:00:32.480]   Yeah, I mean, we're already griping about people walking around like this.
[02:00:32.480 --> 02:00:36.920]   We're really concerned about people doing that and talking about how it's disconnecting
[02:00:36.920 --> 02:00:38.600]   us from the real world.
[02:00:38.600 --> 02:00:39.600]   Yeah.
[02:00:39.600 --> 02:00:41.320]   But what happens if this gets legs?
[02:00:41.320 --> 02:00:42.320]   Oh, wow.
[02:00:42.320 --> 02:00:44.400]   Yeah, that's a whole nother level.
[02:00:44.400 --> 02:00:45.400]   Absolutely is.
[02:00:45.400 --> 02:00:49.800]   I, all right, keep working on that, Microsoft or don't.
[02:00:49.800 --> 02:00:50.800]   No, don't.
[02:00:50.800 --> 02:00:51.800]   Did you know?
[02:00:51.800 --> 02:00:53.280]   Did I?
[02:00:53.280 --> 02:00:58.800]   Did you know that doing a funny dance on an app?
[02:00:58.800 --> 02:01:00.360]   You just have to go to the bathroom?
[02:01:00.360 --> 02:01:01.360]   Is it?
[02:01:01.360 --> 02:01:02.360]   Yes, that.
[02:01:02.360 --> 02:01:05.000]   It means that it could be a matter of national security.
[02:01:05.000 --> 02:01:11.360]   Yes, I did know that from this week's episode of Technus Weekly.
[02:01:11.360 --> 02:01:13.480]   I believe we talked about that.
[02:01:13.480 --> 02:01:17.480]   Thank you for stepping on my Segway.
[02:01:17.480 --> 02:01:18.480]   I'm sorry.
[02:01:18.480 --> 02:01:19.480]   There it goes.
[02:01:19.480 --> 02:01:23.040]   It just zoomed off that Segway you said before.
[02:01:23.040 --> 02:01:24.960]   So we talked about this, yes, earlier this week.
[02:01:24.960 --> 02:01:27.160]   But I thought this was an interesting story.
[02:01:27.160 --> 02:01:31.000]   TikTok is this app that's very popular among the youngsters.
[02:01:31.000 --> 02:01:37.360]   And I'm talking like my youngest sibling probably who finds this app fun.
[02:01:37.360 --> 02:01:40.360]   It's a social video sharing platform.
[02:01:40.360 --> 02:01:47.040]   And senators are looking into the possible security concerns of this app.
[02:01:47.040 --> 02:01:48.720]   There are a couple reasons for that.
[02:01:48.720 --> 02:01:55.520]   One, it is an app that is owned by a company that is a Chinese-based company.
[02:01:55.520 --> 02:02:00.120]   And so data collection practices, privacy collection practices are different.
[02:02:00.120 --> 02:02:02.720]   The laws there are different than they are here in the United States.
[02:02:02.720 --> 02:02:08.360]   TikTok says that the data collected on US users is stored here in the US.
[02:02:08.360 --> 02:02:13.080]   The senators and other lawmakers and officials say that may be true, but you will still be
[02:02:13.080 --> 02:02:18.120]   holding to Chinese laws in which case there's that concern.
[02:02:18.120 --> 02:02:26.360]   The second concern is one that was not brought up necessarily with this last round of inquiries.
[02:02:26.360 --> 02:02:31.200]   But was something earlier on that talked about US troops.
[02:02:31.200 --> 02:02:35.720]   That's actually like there's a category on TikTok that I've seen before that has trended
[02:02:35.720 --> 02:02:40.120]   that you can watch our troops doing funny stuff on TikTok.
[02:02:40.120 --> 02:02:42.040]   Like they post their TikTok videos.
[02:02:42.040 --> 02:02:43.040]   And the idea there is-
[02:02:43.040 --> 02:02:44.520]   I'm a Raoul booster, if you will.
[02:02:44.520 --> 02:02:45.520]   Exactly.
[02:02:45.520 --> 02:02:47.680]   And they could share it amongst each other and whatnot.
[02:02:47.680 --> 02:02:55.680]   The concern there is that if there are troops in the middle of missions that maybe are underground
[02:02:55.680 --> 02:03:01.800]   or are secret or that even folks that are connected to troops that are doing missions
[02:03:01.800 --> 02:03:06.400]   and whatnot, that the location data and whatever else they're pumping into the app could then
[02:03:06.400 --> 02:03:11.200]   be used to inform military movements and things like that.
[02:03:11.200 --> 02:03:12.200]   Huge concern there.
[02:03:12.200 --> 02:03:19.560]   And then the last thing is just the idea that this is yet another vector for spreading propaganda
[02:03:19.560 --> 02:03:21.640]   from outside forces.
[02:03:21.640 --> 02:03:28.600]   So Russia has been proven spread a lot of misinformation on Facebook and other social
[02:03:28.600 --> 02:03:29.600]   platforms.
[02:03:29.600 --> 02:03:30.600]   You already have it.
[02:03:30.600 --> 02:03:31.600]   What?
[02:03:31.600 --> 02:03:33.240]   Not true.
[02:03:33.240 --> 02:03:39.280]   And we've seen some of our other bad actors do the same.
[02:03:39.280 --> 02:03:48.920]   And TikTok which is targeting as an app or is used by a fairly vulnerable group.
[02:03:48.920 --> 02:03:51.720]   It is another place where that could possibly be spread.
[02:03:51.720 --> 02:03:57.600]   I'm a 13 to 18 year olds are kind of like a core part of their base.
[02:03:57.600 --> 02:03:58.600]   Yes.
[02:03:58.600 --> 02:03:59.600]   Right.
[02:03:59.600 --> 02:04:00.600]   Right.
[02:04:00.600 --> 02:04:02.480]   So we've got senators looking into it.
[02:04:02.480 --> 02:04:08.680]   This latest bill as we talked about on Techni's Weekly is a bipartisan or not bill, but this
[02:04:08.680 --> 02:04:11.760]   latest inquiry is a bipartisan inquiry, which I think is good.
[02:04:11.760 --> 02:04:12.760]   That's good.
[02:04:12.760 --> 02:04:16.760]   And so everybody's kind of paying attention to this app and making sure that TikTok is
[02:04:16.760 --> 02:04:22.520]   doing what now it says it's doing, which is that they are separating between the United
[02:04:22.520 --> 02:04:24.280]   States and what happens here.
[02:04:24.280 --> 02:04:28.120]   And I don't mean physically, but I mean the stuff that happens here is different from
[02:04:28.120 --> 02:04:30.720]   how the app is running China and in other places.
[02:04:30.720 --> 02:04:33.040]   So that's just kind of a will see thing.
[02:04:33.040 --> 02:04:34.040]   But I found it.
[02:04:34.040 --> 02:04:35.760]   Let's see how that audit comes out.
[02:04:35.760 --> 02:04:36.760]   Yeah.
[02:04:36.760 --> 02:04:37.760]   Because this is I don't know.
[02:04:37.760 --> 02:04:40.320]   I think of it as just this harmless app.
[02:04:40.320 --> 02:04:45.680]   And we can't we can't think of any technology as just completely harmless and silly.
[02:04:45.680 --> 02:04:47.680]   Yeah, not anymore.
[02:04:47.680 --> 02:04:55.720]   Taylor Lorenz had an awesome article about TikTok and how it's integrating into into high
[02:04:55.720 --> 02:05:01.320]   schools, essentially, and how teachers are actually kind of bringing TikTok, you know,
[02:05:01.320 --> 02:05:05.080]   producing for TikTok into the into the classroom and stuff.
[02:05:05.080 --> 02:05:10.520]   And so when I read this and then I think of that, I'm thinking, okay, if there is some
[02:05:10.520 --> 02:05:16.720]   funny business going on, like that seems like a really messy kind of crossover there to
[02:05:16.720 --> 02:05:19.440]   have both of those things happening simultaneously.
[02:05:19.440 --> 02:05:25.880]   So yeah, it's easy to look at TikTok and just go, hey, it's just all about beauty and dirty
[02:05:25.880 --> 02:05:26.880]   side of technology.
[02:05:26.880 --> 02:05:29.520]   I suppose so for everything for everything.
[02:05:29.520 --> 02:05:30.760]   Yes, exactly.
[02:05:30.760 --> 02:05:38.000]   Even even just an app targeting just dirt, just dancing, you know, and even that can can
[02:05:38.000 --> 02:05:41.240]   potentially be a vector for something nasty and wow.
[02:05:41.240 --> 02:05:42.240]   Yeah.
[02:05:42.240 --> 02:05:44.000]   I like thinking about that.
[02:05:44.000 --> 02:05:47.080]   I don't like thinking about that.
[02:05:47.080 --> 02:05:48.280]   Let's see here.
[02:05:48.280 --> 02:05:50.600]   What about foldable phones?
[02:05:50.600 --> 02:05:56.080]   Were either of you ever a classic Motorola Razr user?
[02:05:56.080 --> 02:05:58.640]   I was not, but that was the first phone I bought.
[02:05:58.640 --> 02:06:04.920]   Queen Pruitt years ago, bought it on Valentine's Day or read Razr phone.
[02:06:04.920 --> 02:06:05.920]   Nice.
[02:06:05.920 --> 02:06:06.920]   I was such a door.
[02:06:06.920 --> 02:06:07.920]   I love the Razr phone.
[02:06:07.920 --> 02:06:08.920]   Yeah.
[02:06:08.920 --> 02:06:09.920]   Yeah.
[02:06:09.920 --> 02:06:10.920]   Yeah.
[02:06:10.920 --> 02:06:11.920]   Did you hang it when you hung up on people?
[02:06:11.920 --> 02:06:12.920]   We were like, smack.
[02:06:12.920 --> 02:06:18.920]   I told you you're going to pay back, pay me back for this loan or I'm going to call your
[02:06:18.920 --> 02:06:19.920]   father.
[02:06:19.920 --> 02:06:23.920]   Oh, you didn't just say that.
[02:06:23.920 --> 02:06:24.920]   Man.
[02:06:24.920 --> 02:06:30.560]   Well, apparently Motorola is going to release their own foldable phone and it's going to
[02:06:30.560 --> 02:06:34.000]   be a new take on the Razr.
[02:06:34.000 --> 02:06:38.080]   Well, there were some leaked photos on Weibo back in April.
[02:06:38.080 --> 02:06:42.000]   I don't know if they're the actual phone, but this is the teaser and you can kind of
[02:06:42.000 --> 02:06:46.360]   see the, it kind of, it's super up close to like keep you guessing.
[02:06:46.360 --> 02:06:51.000]   If you scroll down a little bit, there's an animation and it hardly shows you.
[02:06:51.000 --> 02:06:52.320]   What is happening there?
[02:06:52.320 --> 02:06:54.800]   It's kind of, yeah, it's very difficult to know what's happening.
[02:06:54.800 --> 02:06:56.520]   Does it have rubber on it?
[02:06:56.520 --> 02:06:57.520]   There's a folder.
[02:06:57.520 --> 02:06:59.520]   It's like a snake shitting skin or something.
[02:06:59.520 --> 02:07:01.520]   Yeah, that's what it will look like.
[02:07:01.520 --> 02:07:02.640]   It's very, very weird.
[02:07:02.640 --> 02:07:03.640]   I am uncomfortable.
[02:07:03.640 --> 02:07:08.640]   I mean, I guess you can say that's foldable though, if it's just a flip phone, right?
[02:07:08.640 --> 02:07:12.560]   Well, yeah, well, I guess what I wonder is, well, I guess so.
[02:07:12.560 --> 02:07:13.560]   In and of itself, it's foldable.
[02:07:13.560 --> 02:07:14.560]   It's foldable.
[02:07:14.560 --> 02:07:15.560]   But is it a, we've always had foldable.
[02:07:15.560 --> 02:07:16.560]   Is it double?
[02:07:16.560 --> 02:07:18.560]   Or is it a hinge?
[02:07:18.560 --> 02:07:19.560]   Ooh.
[02:07:19.560 --> 02:07:23.280]   Yeah, like a phone that's got screens this way, hot dog style.
[02:07:23.280 --> 02:07:25.280]   And I think that's what it's, or hamburger style.
[02:07:25.280 --> 02:07:27.480]   Or hamburger style.
[02:07:27.480 --> 02:07:32.760]   But is it one seamless display, or which means that it's like plasticky and weird.
[02:07:32.760 --> 02:07:34.760]   It'll pop it up in time.
[02:07:34.760 --> 02:07:37.000]   And it's going to, you know, you eventually degrade.
[02:07:37.000 --> 02:07:38.000]   Yeah.
[02:07:38.000 --> 02:07:39.000]   Is it Microsoft?
[02:07:39.000 --> 02:07:40.000]   What's it called again?
[02:07:40.000 --> 02:07:41.000]   What is it?
[02:07:41.000 --> 02:07:42.000]   Oh, Duo?
[02:07:42.000 --> 02:07:45.480]   Is it Microsoft Duo or is it Samsung fold?
[02:07:45.480 --> 02:07:46.480]   Is that what it's called?
[02:07:46.480 --> 02:07:47.480]   Galaxy Fold.
[02:07:47.480 --> 02:07:54.320]   Or is it Huawei Mate X, which is the other foldable phone tablet that Noah talks about that also
[02:07:54.320 --> 02:07:59.360]   got delayed when the Samsung Galaxy Fold got delayed.
[02:07:59.360 --> 02:08:01.120]   Is it my paper phone?
[02:08:01.120 --> 02:08:02.120]   Hello.
[02:08:02.120 --> 02:08:04.200]   You'd be surprised.
[02:08:04.200 --> 02:08:07.640]   That's pretty close to the way they actually are.
[02:08:07.640 --> 02:08:08.640]   They're that delicate too.
[02:08:08.640 --> 02:08:09.640]   Yeah, exactly.
[02:08:09.640 --> 02:08:11.200]   It's just like a piece of paper.
[02:08:11.200 --> 02:08:14.040]   The Mate X was delayed.
[02:08:14.040 --> 02:08:17.800]   But apparently it's coming out in China, November 15th.
[02:08:17.800 --> 02:08:20.960]   This is another $2400 phone.
[02:08:20.960 --> 02:08:23.680]   This one folds the opposite way, if I remember correctly.
[02:08:23.680 --> 02:08:29.360]   So that the Galaxy Fold folds the display into, so it folds like a book.
[02:08:29.360 --> 02:08:31.640]   And this one folds with the displays on the outside.
[02:08:31.640 --> 02:08:32.640]   Oh, so that is--
[02:08:32.640 --> 02:08:33.640]   Both are weird.
[02:08:33.640 --> 02:08:35.800]   That's Mountain Fold instead of Valley Fold.
[02:08:35.800 --> 02:08:36.800]   Oh, okay.
[02:08:36.800 --> 02:08:39.440]   According to, if you're doing origami, paper foldable.
[02:08:39.440 --> 02:08:40.440]   Oh, really?
[02:08:40.440 --> 02:08:41.440]   Did you just make that up?
[02:08:41.440 --> 02:08:42.440]   I know.
[02:08:42.440 --> 02:08:43.440]   That's God's honest truth.
[02:08:43.440 --> 02:08:44.440]   Wow.
[02:08:44.440 --> 02:08:45.440]   T.I.L.
[02:08:45.440 --> 02:08:47.520]   They don't use that in their marketing.
[02:08:47.520 --> 02:08:48.520]   T.I.L.
[02:08:48.520 --> 02:08:52.200]   So anyways, I know that you're looking for a new foldable phone to get.
[02:08:52.200 --> 02:08:54.640]   So $2400, all you gotta do is go to China.
[02:08:54.640 --> 02:08:56.400]   I've got my foldable phone right here.
[02:08:56.400 --> 02:08:57.400]   So what is that?
[02:08:57.400 --> 02:08:58.400]   Oh, that thing's pretty.
[02:08:58.400 --> 02:09:00.600]   Yeah, so you were calling this the Elvis?
[02:09:00.600 --> 02:09:02.520]   This is Elvis.
[02:09:02.520 --> 02:09:08.600]   This is the new Microsoft Surface Book 3 that just came out.
[02:09:08.600 --> 02:09:10.400]   It is incredibly lightweight.
[02:09:10.400 --> 02:09:14.480]   Look, that's a real Windows logo on the back instead of the sticker that I was using on
[02:09:14.480 --> 02:09:16.120]   Windows Weekly.
[02:09:16.120 --> 02:09:19.720]   And this is when Microsoft breaks the internet, folks.
[02:09:19.720 --> 02:09:21.880]   This bad boy is gorgeous, first of all.
[02:09:21.880 --> 02:09:22.880]   This blue color.
[02:09:22.880 --> 02:09:25.600]   I wish Apple would do some fun stuff like this.
[02:09:25.600 --> 02:09:26.760]   It's very lightweight.
[02:09:26.760 --> 02:09:31.800]   It's got the standard Surface Book port or Surface port, Dilly Bob thingy.
[02:09:31.800 --> 02:09:32.800]   You'll have to--
[02:09:32.800 --> 02:09:33.800]   The power.
[02:09:33.800 --> 02:09:34.800]   Yeah, the power, exactly.
[02:09:34.800 --> 02:09:36.160]   Be nice because I'm new.
[02:09:36.160 --> 02:09:39.240]   I'm returning to the world of Windows a little bit.
[02:09:39.240 --> 02:09:43.200]   A standard USB A port, USB C, headphone jack.
[02:09:43.200 --> 02:09:48.440]   But what's really nice is how easy as they talked on stage, it lifts with one finger.
[02:09:48.440 --> 02:09:49.440]   Oh, there's Windows.
[02:09:49.440 --> 02:09:50.440]   Hello.
[02:09:50.440 --> 02:09:56.280]   The reason it's called Elvis is because it, unfortunately-- so during Windows Weekly,
[02:09:56.280 --> 02:10:00.320]   Leo chatted me on Slack and he said, "I had made a joke.
[02:10:00.320 --> 02:10:04.520]   I had made a joke that I said, 'If I do Windows Weekly enough, then I'm going to have to get
[02:10:04.520 --> 02:10:05.520]   a Surface Book.'
[02:10:05.520 --> 02:10:08.280]   And then we joked about it on iOS today that he would never do that because you don't
[02:10:08.280 --> 02:10:11.320]   let your friends use Windows was the thing."
[02:10:11.320 --> 02:10:17.440]   And so during Windows Weekly, I guess he decided that my joke should be a reality.
[02:10:17.440 --> 02:10:20.480]   And so he messaged me and was like, "Hey, you're going to be doing Windows Weekly while
[02:10:20.480 --> 02:10:21.480]   I'm out.
[02:10:21.480 --> 02:10:22.480]   Let's get a Surface Book."
[02:10:22.480 --> 02:10:23.480]   And I asked which one I wanted.
[02:10:23.480 --> 02:10:27.600]   And I was like, "I really want the blue one, but the problem is it has Alcantara, which
[02:10:27.600 --> 02:10:32.520]   is this faux suede stuff."
[02:10:32.520 --> 02:10:37.440]   And so I said, "I'll just get the sandstone one," which is kind of like a rose gold almost.
[02:10:37.440 --> 02:10:40.640]   Mary Jo Foley was getting the sandstone one.
[02:10:40.640 --> 02:10:41.720]   So Leo said, "You know what?
[02:10:41.720 --> 02:10:44.880]   I'm getting you the blue one, but you have to call it Elvis."
[02:10:44.880 --> 02:10:47.240]   And that's because of the blue suede.
[02:10:47.240 --> 02:10:49.960]   So as you can see, there's the Alcantara.
[02:10:49.960 --> 02:10:54.600]   And it actually is pretty soft, but I'm worried about how it's going to be over time.
[02:10:54.600 --> 02:11:00.080]   But what I like about this, I didn't realize I was going to like a 13-inch laptop, but
[02:11:00.080 --> 02:11:01.360]   it's lightweight.
[02:11:01.360 --> 02:11:04.640]   It's better than lugging around my MacBook.
[02:11:04.640 --> 02:11:10.640]   And so I'm going to be using this a lot on shows that I do, not just Windows Weekly,
[02:11:10.640 --> 02:11:12.240]   but T&W and all the other ones.
[02:11:12.240 --> 02:11:15.200]   And then it's also touchscreen, which is nice.
[02:11:15.200 --> 02:11:16.520]   Oh, there's me sniffing it.
[02:11:16.520 --> 02:11:20.200]   That was Paul said, "You need to sniff the Alcantara because for a few days it's going
[02:11:20.200 --> 02:11:21.840]   to smell kind of chemically."
[02:11:21.840 --> 02:11:24.600]   And it kind of smells a little bit like dry erase markers.
[02:11:24.600 --> 02:11:26.160]   Oh, okay, that's delightful.
[02:11:26.160 --> 02:11:27.600]   Does it get you high?
[02:11:27.600 --> 02:11:29.360]   Well, let me see.
[02:11:29.360 --> 02:11:31.600]   Don't huff your laptop.
[02:11:31.600 --> 02:11:34.400]   It's starting to look like a triple rainbow.
[02:11:34.400 --> 02:11:36.880]   Triple complete rainbow.
[02:11:36.880 --> 02:11:43.320]   So yeah, that's the very lightweight, very pretty, I have to say, and well-built Surface
[02:11:43.320 --> 02:11:45.560]   Book 3 running Windows 10.
[02:11:45.560 --> 02:11:46.560]   What are you guys?
[02:11:46.560 --> 02:11:47.760]   And you just got that, right?
[02:11:47.760 --> 02:11:49.760]   Yeah, I got this on Tuesday.
[02:11:49.760 --> 02:11:53.160]   I'm listed on the show on Wednesday.
[02:11:53.160 --> 02:11:54.320]   Leo did not...
[02:11:54.320 --> 02:11:55.840]   It can go up to 16 gigs.
[02:11:55.840 --> 02:11:57.720]   This just has eight in it.
[02:11:57.720 --> 02:12:01.400]   So it's not a powerhouse by any means, but...
[02:12:01.400 --> 02:12:04.240]   So it won't power your VR set while you're walking down the street.
[02:12:04.240 --> 02:12:06.240]   No, you can throw that in the back.
[02:12:06.240 --> 02:12:07.240]   Oh, man.
[02:12:07.240 --> 02:12:13.120]   Look, all of these humans I've turned into Chihuahua is this is my world now.
[02:12:13.120 --> 02:12:14.320]   I love this place.
[02:12:14.320 --> 02:12:19.160]   I realized I was talking down on this technology and Twitter, but you guys have got to try this.
[02:12:19.160 --> 02:12:21.160]   Chihuahua is everywhere.
[02:12:21.160 --> 02:12:22.160]   Chihuahua is everywhere.
[02:12:22.160 --> 02:12:24.320]   No, maybe I'm still just high from the audience.
[02:12:24.320 --> 02:12:26.360]   Yeah, I think that's probably the case.
[02:12:26.360 --> 02:12:27.360]   Cool.
[02:12:27.360 --> 02:12:28.360]   Nice look.
[02:12:28.360 --> 02:12:29.360]   Can I feel this wave?
[02:12:29.360 --> 02:12:30.360]   Oh, sorry.
[02:12:30.360 --> 02:12:31.360]   I just want to...
[02:12:31.360 --> 02:12:32.360]   Yeah, very nice.
[02:12:32.360 --> 02:12:33.360]   Oh, that's a soft weight.
[02:12:33.360 --> 02:12:34.360]   It's nice.
[02:12:34.360 --> 02:12:35.360]   I've got shoes just like it.
[02:12:35.360 --> 02:12:37.680]   Very, very nice.
[02:12:37.680 --> 02:12:38.680]   I think we've done it.
[02:12:38.680 --> 02:12:40.720]   Is there anything that anyone is like...
[02:12:40.720 --> 02:12:45.640]   Champing the bit to talk about or I think we've maybe talked about every single tech
[02:12:45.640 --> 02:12:46.640]   news story that we've missed.
[02:12:46.640 --> 02:12:50.200]   We've talked about every week that happened this week we've discussed.
[02:12:50.200 --> 02:12:51.920]   There is one thing that we missed.
[02:12:51.920 --> 02:12:53.560]   Even the one thing we didn't want to talk about.
[02:12:53.560 --> 02:12:54.560]   Yeah.
[02:12:54.560 --> 02:12:55.560]   You know what?
[02:12:55.560 --> 02:12:56.560]   I appreciate that you've led with that.
[02:12:56.560 --> 02:12:58.520]   We're like, man, I don't want to talk about that.
[02:12:58.520 --> 02:13:00.520]   Let's just get it out of the way.
[02:13:00.520 --> 02:13:02.280]   So happy you did that.
[02:13:02.280 --> 02:13:04.240]   That worked out really well.
[02:13:04.240 --> 02:13:05.960]   This was so much fun.
[02:13:05.960 --> 02:13:06.960]   Yes.
[02:13:06.960 --> 02:13:07.960]   I really enjoyed it.
[02:13:07.960 --> 02:13:08.960]   Yes.
[02:13:08.960 --> 02:13:09.960]   We should do this again.
[02:13:09.960 --> 02:13:10.960]   We should kick Leo out.
[02:13:10.960 --> 02:13:11.960]   Like, hey Leo, go take a vacation or something.
[02:13:11.960 --> 02:13:12.960]   Yeah, go ahead and do that.
[02:13:12.960 --> 02:13:15.560]   And then send us more Surface Book 3s.
[02:13:15.560 --> 02:13:16.560]   Yes.
[02:13:16.560 --> 02:13:17.560]   Yes.
[02:13:17.560 --> 02:13:19.120]   Everybody can have one of these.
[02:13:19.120 --> 02:13:20.120]   Right on.
[02:13:20.120 --> 02:13:22.200]   Okay, so, and plug away.
[02:13:22.200 --> 02:13:23.200]   What you got going on.
[02:13:23.200 --> 02:13:25.080]   You just launched another new show.
[02:13:25.080 --> 02:13:26.080]   You're busy.
[02:13:26.080 --> 02:13:28.080]   Dude, this has been a big week, man.
[02:13:28.080 --> 02:13:31.120]   This was episode two of hand zone photography.
[02:13:31.120 --> 02:13:35.520]   And most importantly, episode one of focus on photography.
[02:13:35.520 --> 02:13:39.880]   So we got hop and fop in your podcatcher feeds.
[02:13:39.880 --> 02:13:44.080]   Focus on photography is a totally different show is not what people are assuming it was
[02:13:44.080 --> 02:13:49.000]   going to be with me rambling on about adding saturation and contrast.
[02:13:49.000 --> 02:13:54.820]   It is just sitting down and talking about photography related news, rumors, and just
[02:13:54.820 --> 02:13:57.400]   real life being a photographer.
[02:13:57.400 --> 02:14:03.000]   What's it like to be a photographer in today's world and just all of the trials, tribulations
[02:14:03.000 --> 02:14:04.640]   and fun stories.
[02:14:04.640 --> 02:14:06.320]   We just have a good conversation.
[02:14:06.320 --> 02:14:10.520]   Me and Mr. Michael Woolsey had a good time talking about this.
[02:14:10.520 --> 02:14:11.600]   It was a lot of fun.
[02:14:11.600 --> 02:14:12.600]   And every week different.
[02:14:12.600 --> 02:14:14.040]   We're going to do this every week.
[02:14:14.040 --> 02:14:18.360]   And we're going to have a few guests here and there, especially here in November.
[02:14:18.360 --> 02:14:23.760]   A lot of people wanted to wait until after Adobe Max and things like that because photographers
[02:14:23.760 --> 02:14:25.200]   are busy with the Adobe Max.
[02:14:25.200 --> 02:14:26.200]   Indeed.
[02:14:26.200 --> 02:14:27.200]   Imagine that.
[02:14:27.200 --> 02:14:31.760]   But we're going to do it every Thursday, 9 a.m. Pacific time.
[02:14:31.760 --> 02:14:33.520]   I'm not on the East Coast anymore, right?
[02:14:33.520 --> 02:14:37.360]   No, no, not that I know of.
[02:14:37.360 --> 02:14:38.360]   I don't know.
[02:14:38.360 --> 02:14:39.360]   I was huffing Micah's laptop.
[02:14:39.360 --> 02:14:40.360]   Yeah.
[02:14:40.360 --> 02:14:41.360]   I'm not sure.
[02:14:41.360 --> 02:14:43.600]   I kind of feel like I'm on the East Coast right now.
[02:14:43.600 --> 02:14:46.680]   But it's been a lot of fun getting that up and running.
[02:14:46.680 --> 02:14:50.160]   And hands on photography is at 2 p.m. on Thursday.
[02:14:50.160 --> 02:14:52.000]   And that's just me solo.
[02:14:52.000 --> 02:14:53.000]   Quick hitters.
[02:14:53.000 --> 02:14:54.680]   Go check episode two out.
[02:14:54.680 --> 02:14:57.680]   It was a lot more hands on and trial and error.
[02:14:57.680 --> 02:15:01.560]   And you might learn something from it if you're getting started with photography.
[02:15:01.560 --> 02:15:02.560]   Right on.
[02:15:02.560 --> 02:15:03.560]   I'm excited for you.
[02:15:03.560 --> 02:15:04.560]   Two shows.
[02:15:04.560 --> 02:15:05.560]   Thank you.
[02:15:05.560 --> 02:15:06.560]   You're busy.
[02:15:06.560 --> 02:15:07.760]   I'm pumped up now thinking about it.
[02:15:07.760 --> 02:15:09.480]   I'm sorry I got to calm down.
[02:15:09.480 --> 02:15:10.480]   Calm down.
[02:15:10.480 --> 02:15:11.480]   Calm down.
[02:15:11.480 --> 02:15:12.480]   Fire bomb.
[02:15:12.480 --> 02:15:13.480]   Twits.
[02:15:13.480 --> 02:15:14.480]   Thanks, Ed.
[02:15:14.480 --> 02:15:17.040]   This was fun.
[02:15:17.040 --> 02:15:21.880]   And Micah, you have your new show that's buzzing at this point.
[02:15:21.880 --> 02:15:22.880]   Yes.
[02:15:22.880 --> 02:15:23.880]   You're like a...
[02:15:23.880 --> 02:15:24.880]   No, no, no, no.
[02:15:24.880 --> 02:15:25.880]   It's actually really exciting.
[02:15:25.880 --> 02:15:27.880]   It was like three weeks ago, right?
[02:15:27.880 --> 02:15:29.680]   Yeah, they so.
[02:15:29.680 --> 02:15:34.560]   Smart Tech Today is a show I do Mondays at 4 p.m. Pacific.
[02:15:34.560 --> 02:15:37.000]   It is with Matthew Casanelli as my co-host.
[02:15:37.000 --> 02:15:40.640]   It's a show where we talk about all sorts of smart tech.
[02:15:40.640 --> 02:15:47.320]   So whether it's a smart toaster, a voice assistant or smart tech that you take with
[02:15:47.320 --> 02:15:49.880]   you in the car, wherever it happens to be, we go there.
[02:15:49.880 --> 02:15:50.960]   We find that we talk about it.
[02:15:50.960 --> 02:15:56.040]   We just talked about a smart toilet in this last episode, which was kind of fun.
[02:15:56.040 --> 02:16:01.960]   So yeah, that show is available for you to check out every Monday.
[02:16:01.960 --> 02:16:05.200]   Just a heads up that depending on how the fires are going, you might get this one on
[02:16:05.200 --> 02:16:08.760]   Tuesday, but it will be there in your feeds.
[02:16:08.760 --> 02:16:15.880]   And yeah, we've been getting some trending places on different podcast apps and services.
[02:16:15.880 --> 02:16:19.000]   So that is an audio show right now.
[02:16:19.000 --> 02:16:22.680]   But if we get to 30,000 subscribers, it becomes a video show.
[02:16:22.680 --> 02:16:27.680]   So if you are interested in smart tech, please give it a subscription.
[02:16:27.680 --> 02:16:28.680]   Tell your friends about it.
[02:16:28.680 --> 02:16:34.120]   Have them check it out too and help us add video to what I would say already is a pretty
[02:16:34.120 --> 02:16:35.280]   good audio stream.
[02:16:35.280 --> 02:16:39.080]   You know, we try to focus on that to make sure that it's not something where you have
[02:16:39.080 --> 02:16:40.080]   to see video.
[02:16:40.080 --> 02:16:45.440]   Well, yeah, what I dig about it is you didn't necessarily go at it and say, I O T.
[02:16:45.440 --> 02:16:46.440]   Yes.
[02:16:46.440 --> 02:16:51.000]   It's not just a broad spectrum and you and Mr. Casanova do a good job on that.
[02:16:51.000 --> 02:16:55.080]   I appreciate you having to dance around all of the wake words.
[02:16:55.080 --> 02:16:56.080]   Oh my God.
[02:16:56.080 --> 02:16:57.080]   That's always fun.
[02:16:57.080 --> 02:17:05.440]   In fact, I met the guy who gave us the suggestion of using the NATO alphabet to determine what
[02:17:05.440 --> 02:17:07.280]   the words would be.
[02:17:07.280 --> 02:17:09.560]   So that was really neat.
[02:17:09.560 --> 02:17:13.560]   He came in and watched iOS today and a few other shows.
[02:17:13.560 --> 02:17:15.720]   And he was like, yeah, I'm going to sit that email about it.
[02:17:15.720 --> 02:17:16.720]   No way.
[02:17:16.720 --> 02:17:17.720]   This is crazy.
[02:17:17.720 --> 02:17:18.720]   So awesome.
[02:17:18.720 --> 02:17:19.720]   Pretty neat.
[02:17:19.720 --> 02:17:20.720]   Right on.
[02:17:20.720 --> 02:17:21.720]   Cool.
[02:17:21.720 --> 02:17:22.720]   What about you?
[02:17:22.720 --> 02:17:23.720]   What about me?
[02:17:23.720 --> 02:17:24.720]   Well, all about Android.
[02:17:24.720 --> 02:17:25.720]   Got a new phone.
[02:17:25.720 --> 02:17:26.720]   Got a new phone.
[02:17:26.720 --> 02:17:29.440]   So I'm definitely going to spend more time with the Pixel 4.
[02:17:29.440 --> 02:17:32.760]   I mean, this is my phone for the next year.
[02:17:32.760 --> 02:17:36.560]   And then all the other phones that are on the show, all about Android, Twitter.tv/AA.
[02:17:36.560 --> 02:17:41.680]   Of course, Tech News Weekly, which I do with Micah every Thursday.
[02:17:41.680 --> 02:17:43.200]   And I'm going to be out a couple of times.
[02:17:43.200 --> 02:17:45.200]   So then Ant's going to be in.
[02:17:45.200 --> 02:17:51.440]   And yeah, so you're going to get different aspects of all of us on T&W in the coming
[02:17:51.440 --> 02:17:52.680]   weeks.
[02:17:52.680 --> 02:17:53.680]   And so much more.
[02:17:53.680 --> 02:17:55.680]   I'm working on some new stuff.
[02:17:55.680 --> 02:17:56.680]   I'm going to say some art secrets.
[02:17:56.680 --> 02:17:59.120]   I'm going to set the new in the pipeline.
[02:17:59.120 --> 02:18:00.960]   So we've got plans, y'all.
[02:18:00.960 --> 02:18:01.960]   Yeah.
[02:18:01.960 --> 02:18:02.960]   Yeah.
[02:18:02.960 --> 02:18:03.960]   Yeah.
[02:18:03.960 --> 02:18:04.960]   Excited.
[02:18:04.960 --> 02:18:05.960]   Plans AF.
[02:18:05.960 --> 02:18:06.960]   That's right.
[02:18:06.960 --> 02:18:07.960]   Inside joke.
[02:18:07.960 --> 02:18:16.800]   I just want to give a big thanks to everyone who scrambled to make this possible because
[02:18:16.800 --> 02:18:21.520]   it's not easy to take a show that was supposed to be on one day and move it to another.
[02:18:21.520 --> 02:18:23.600]   Too many names to list, but y'all are awesome.
[02:18:23.600 --> 02:18:28.200]   Everybody who works here is so supportive and just really appreciate your support in
[02:18:28.200 --> 02:18:29.520]   getting this going.
[02:18:29.520 --> 02:18:31.840]   And thanks to everyone in the chat room for hopping in last minute.
[02:18:31.840 --> 02:18:32.840]   Yeah, thanks for joining us.
[02:18:32.840 --> 02:18:35.600]   Making us feel like we've got a live audience, which is really great.
[02:18:35.600 --> 02:18:37.240]   Spending your Friday nights with us.
[02:18:37.240 --> 02:18:38.240]   What's up?
[02:18:38.240 --> 02:18:44.120]   I do want to say, folks out there, if you go to TWIT.community, Twit.community.
[02:18:44.120 --> 02:18:45.600]   Oh, yes.
[02:18:45.600 --> 02:18:48.520]   You can sign up to become a member of the community we have going there.
[02:18:48.520 --> 02:18:51.960]   It's a forum that's full of awesome people.
[02:18:51.960 --> 02:18:57.040]   It's a great way to chat with hosts and producers and everybody who works here Twit and conversations
[02:18:57.040 --> 02:18:58.080]   with all of the other Twits.
[02:18:58.080 --> 02:19:02.400]   So even if you're not able to check us out live in the chat, if you're listening to the
[02:19:02.400 --> 02:19:05.600]   podcast and you want to go back later and comment on an episode, that's a great place
[02:19:05.600 --> 02:19:06.600]   to do it.
[02:19:06.600 --> 02:19:11.760]   Twit.community, you can tap sign up at the top and join and become a member there.
[02:19:11.760 --> 02:19:13.640]   Yeah, that community's page is awesome.
[02:19:13.640 --> 02:19:15.640]   There's always new stuff.
[02:19:15.640 --> 02:19:18.080]   You can feature in if a new episode is posted.
[02:19:18.080 --> 02:19:19.080]   Funny years.
[02:19:19.080 --> 02:19:21.080]   People start jumping on that.
[02:19:21.080 --> 02:19:22.520]   That's really great.
[02:19:22.520 --> 02:19:27.240]   And you guys are a big reason why because you're being so involved with it.
[02:19:27.240 --> 02:19:28.760]   We appreciate that.
[02:19:28.760 --> 02:19:33.960]   As for this show, this week in tech, we've got a number of different folks hopping in.
[02:19:33.960 --> 02:19:36.560]   We will not be back next week on the show.
[02:19:36.560 --> 02:19:40.480]   We've got different people in line each and every week while Leo is gone.
[02:19:40.480 --> 02:19:43.080]   But you can check out the recording.
[02:19:43.080 --> 02:19:44.920]   If you want to tune in live, you can.
[02:19:44.920 --> 02:19:49.480]   It's live every Sunday starting at 2 p.m. Pacific.
[02:19:49.480 --> 02:19:54.160]   The recorded show will appear in the feed later in the evening on Sunday.
[02:19:54.160 --> 02:19:58.240]   So if you go to twit.tv/twit, that's the show page.
[02:19:58.240 --> 02:20:02.520]   That's where all the links for all of our ways to subscribe, which is what you want to do
[02:20:02.520 --> 02:20:03.520]   ultimately.
[02:20:03.520 --> 02:20:08.520]   They're all listed there.
[02:20:08.520 --> 02:20:15.200]   You can start back at episode one of this week in tech and watch all 742 episodes.
[02:20:15.200 --> 02:20:17.400]   You can binge if you like.
[02:20:17.400 --> 02:20:19.400]   We won't stop you.
[02:20:19.400 --> 02:20:20.800]   You can binge if you want to.
[02:20:20.800 --> 02:20:22.200]   It really is the way back to machine.
[02:20:22.200 --> 02:20:27.920]   When you go back to episode one, you'll be hearing some historical tech news.
[02:20:27.920 --> 02:20:33.320]   For all of us here at twit, just really appreciate once again you checking this episode out
[02:20:33.320 --> 02:20:36.880]   and not turning it off when you realize Leo wasn't here.
[02:20:36.880 --> 02:20:39.440]   We were honored to be here in Leo's absence.
[02:20:39.440 --> 02:20:41.760]   And we'll see you all next week.
[02:20:41.760 --> 02:20:46.800]   Another twit is in the can.
[02:20:46.800 --> 02:20:50.600]   Bye everybody.
[02:20:50.600 --> 02:21:00.000]   I was coming up with a name for your new sitcom from Micah to Micah.
[02:21:00.000 --> 02:21:03.040]   Micah Sergeant plays two versions of himself.
[02:21:03.040 --> 02:21:07.440]   The future version and the present or the past version.
[02:21:07.440 --> 02:21:09.320]   Back in my day, young Micah.
[02:21:09.320 --> 02:21:10.320]   I would watch it.
[02:21:10.320 --> 02:21:11.320]   Yes.
[02:21:11.320 --> 02:21:12.920]   Don't you remember what we used to do?
[02:21:12.920 --> 02:21:14.160]   I do.
[02:21:14.160 --> 02:21:18.040]   We would go swimming down at the lake.
[02:21:18.040 --> 02:21:19.040]   This week in Thespian.
[02:21:19.040 --> 02:21:25.840]   And we weren't supposed to be swimming at the lake because it was like, well, radioactive.
[02:21:25.840 --> 02:21:27.680]   And that's why I have a third leg.
[02:21:27.680 --> 02:21:28.680]   That makes sense.
[02:21:28.680 --> 02:21:29.680]   That makes sense.
[02:21:29.680 --> 02:21:30.680]   Why do you have a third leg?
[02:21:30.680 --> 02:21:32.520]   I'm really sorry about that old Micah.
[02:21:32.520 --> 02:21:33.680]   I just really liked that lake.
[02:21:33.680 --> 02:21:34.680]   It was so nice.
[02:21:34.680 --> 02:21:35.680]   I know.
[02:21:35.680 --> 02:21:36.680]   I remember.
[02:21:36.680 --> 02:21:37.680]   It was so many ways.
[02:21:37.680 --> 02:21:38.680]   But now it's so complicated.
[02:21:38.680 --> 02:21:39.680]   Clearly it is.
[02:21:39.680 --> 02:21:42.160]   I don't know what to do about this third leg.
[02:21:42.160 --> 02:21:43.680]   Well, just think about it.
[02:21:43.680 --> 02:21:45.960]   At least when you were a kid, you had a lot of fun, right?
[02:21:45.960 --> 02:21:49.360]   Well, I suppose that's one way to think about a young.
[02:21:49.360 --> 02:21:50.360]   But now...
[02:21:50.360 --> 02:21:52.480]   Are you Marlon Brando now?
[02:21:52.480 --> 02:21:53.480]   That's transforming.
[02:21:53.480 --> 02:21:55.560]   You went into that leg.
[02:21:55.560 --> 02:21:59.200]   I'll make you an offer you couldn't refuse.
[02:21:59.200 --> 02:22:00.200]   I don't know.
[02:22:00.200 --> 02:22:02.360]   It's a pretty smooth transition there, sir.
[02:22:02.360 --> 02:22:05.800]   I just need to put some cotton balls on my nose or some grapes.
[02:22:05.800 --> 02:22:08.760]   Well, I don't particularly like grapes.
[02:22:08.760 --> 02:22:11.280]   So wait a minute, are you a Fespian?
[02:22:11.280 --> 02:22:12.280]   Grapes are bad for...
[02:22:12.280 --> 02:22:13.280]   Yeah.
[02:22:13.280 --> 02:22:14.280]   I was a member.
[02:22:14.280 --> 02:22:15.280]   In fact, last night we were talking about that.
[02:22:15.280 --> 02:22:21.360]   I was a member of International Fespian Society when I was in high school.
[02:22:21.360 --> 02:22:22.360]   And what's her name?
[02:22:22.360 --> 02:22:23.360]   Shannon Morse.
[02:22:23.360 --> 02:22:32.320]   Shannon Morse, she and I went to the same local regional, thespian troop thing.
[02:22:32.320 --> 02:22:33.320]   Every year.
[02:22:33.320 --> 02:22:35.360]   Because we're both from Missouri.
[02:22:35.360 --> 02:22:37.360]   And that was a really fun moment last night.
[02:22:37.360 --> 02:22:38.360]   We got a cool kid.
[02:22:38.360 --> 02:22:39.360]   We didn't know the Missourian.
