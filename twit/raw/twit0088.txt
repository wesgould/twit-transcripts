[00:02:19.760 --> 00:02:22.880]   Veronica was on briefly but she refused to stick around.
[00:02:22.880 --> 00:02:25.640]   Yeah, she just put her foot down and said no.
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:28.280]   I think it had something to do with I don't know work.
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:30.520]   We don't understand work.
[00:02:30.520 --> 00:02:34.600]   I think it's just another indicator that women, women, grown about the fact that there's
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.240]   male dominated little areas that we create.
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:39.400]   They don't want to join us.
[00:02:39.400 --> 00:02:40.800]   I mean, we try and join.
[00:02:40.800 --> 00:02:42.880]   She'll join sometime in the future.
[00:02:42.880 --> 00:02:44.680]   Let's be strong at honor at the last minute.
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:45.680]   Let's be fair exactly.
[00:02:45.680 --> 00:02:47.040]   We said do it now.
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.840]   And of course she has a job.
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:51.240]   What do we get?
[00:02:51.240 --> 00:02:53.800]   Most 90% of the guys if you told them to do it now they would.
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:54.800]   Oh, it's a guy thing?
[00:02:54.800 --> 00:02:55.800]   No, I mean, you say no.
[00:02:55.800 --> 00:02:58.040]   You guys have no sense of responsibility.
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.080]   No, I don't think women like doing this stuff.
[00:03:02.080 --> 00:03:03.880]   I think that they talk about big games.
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:04.880]   Veronica, what's going on?
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:05.880]   That's not true.
[00:03:05.880 --> 00:03:06.880]   I do it.
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:08.720]   Molly Wood and Veronica Belmont do a show with me every day for half hour.
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:12.960]   They talk a big game but when it comes down to it, you know, we're talking about the big
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:13.960]   leagues here, Tom.
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:14.960]   Not your little show.
[00:03:14.960 --> 00:03:15.960]   Oh, please.
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:17.400]   His show is a lot bigger than this one.
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:19.600]   Has anybody tried Yahoo pipes yet?
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:21.680]   I was playing around with it this afternoon.
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:24.720]   I can't make heads or tails of how to make it work yet but the stuff that people have
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:25.800]   already built is kind of cool.
[00:03:25.800 --> 00:03:26.800]   At least you can get on now.
[00:03:26.800 --> 00:03:28.800]   Somebody explain what it is, please.
[00:03:28.800 --> 00:03:30.640]   Oh, it's kind of a hard explain.
[00:03:30.640 --> 00:03:33.400]   It's basically you're going to hate this, John.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.400]   You know, Unix pipes?
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.280]   Well, it's like that only for the web.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:38.280]   Well, what's the point?
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:39.880]   Merlin, can you explain better than that?
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:42.080]   Yeah, I mean, I play with it just a little bit.
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:43.080]   It's a way.
[00:03:43.080 --> 00:03:45.440]   I mean, you couldn't on one level, I guess, call it a mashup tool.
[00:03:45.440 --> 00:03:49.960]   The idea is that you can take different kinds of RSS feeds from different places and apply
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:53.160]   little bits of logic to it to kind of mash it up in different forms.
[00:03:53.160 --> 00:03:55.760]   And that's a very short explanation of it.
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.400]   Is it a scripting language?
[00:03:57.400 --> 00:03:58.400]   No.
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.520]   No, it's a good, the neat part is it's a drag and drop gooey.
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.520]   It's right.
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.360]   And so you can basically say, you know, I want to take this feed and that feed and I want
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.440]   it, for example, actually, Boing Boing was saying, well, you know, if you don't like
[00:04:07.440 --> 00:04:11.280]   posts by a certain, you know, author, you can say, just remove those.
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:15.120]   So you play a little logic to mash it up feeds and then kind of make new stuff out of
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:16.120]   it.
[00:04:16.120 --> 00:04:18.160]   So what have you tried top that you like?
[00:04:18.160 --> 00:04:21.800]   I mean, because they have a lot of people who have made pipes.
[00:04:21.800 --> 00:04:26.400]   Yeah, well, most of my time was spent connecting the little pipes themselves because the visual
[00:04:26.400 --> 00:04:27.600]   interface is really cool.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:30.680]   But I didn't have enough time to learn it to make anything real.
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:36.480]   I looked at the New York Times flicker mashup, which searches the New York Times feed, it
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:41.080]   takes the New York Times feed and searches for keywords there, does an analysis of some
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:44.840]   sort and then comes up with flicker images related to the stories that are on the front
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:46.120]   page of the New York Times.
[00:04:46.120 --> 00:04:47.120]   So that's an example.
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.160]   It's a mashup of flicker in the New York Times.
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:53.760]   But you don't need to use Ruby on Rails anymore, you just draw and it does it.
[00:04:53.760 --> 00:04:54.760]   Yeah.
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.280]   It used to be you'd have to cobble together crazy pearl libraries and screen scraping.
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.880]   And so for example, if you wanted to make one all-encompassing page that pulled in all
[00:05:01.880 --> 00:05:05.160]   the lea feeds in one place, that's something you could whip together pretty quickly.
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.160]   Or somebody else could.
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:09.960]   The thing that's, I think the reason it's a hot news story, I mean, it is a cool technology,
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.960]   but it also is the first time in quite a while that Yahoo has been first at anything.
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.520]   I mean, this is completely unique, Google probably saying, "Don't we should, we should
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:22.840]   have thought of that."
[00:05:22.840 --> 00:05:23.840]   It's pretty impressive.
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:25.640]   It's also not something that they've had to buy in.
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:26.640]   Right.
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:30.000]   All the cool stuff Yahoo's done recently has been bought in and this seems to be straight
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   from the labs.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:35.600]   I think some ways it establishes, it puts Yahoo back on the map as a innovator, don't
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:36.600]   you think?
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:39.240]   It certainly came out of nowhere.
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.400]   I don't think anybody was expecting it.
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:42.360]   They buy it from somebody, do we know?
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:44.440]   Well, we don't know, but it doesn't look like they did.
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:47.120]   I just did a search on the thing for IPTV.
[00:05:47.120 --> 00:05:48.960]   God, there's nothing at close.
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:51.960]   Well, you have to create, but see you could create an IPTV pipe.
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:54.800]   Yeah, maybe I will.
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:06:00.600]   It's not so much, I think it's cool, but it's not so much what you could do with it.
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:02.600]   It's just that this is, I think, from...
[00:06:02.600 --> 00:06:04.480]   I think there's a real need for this stuff.
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:08.000]   I mean, there's been sites out there, at least for my own usages, how I see myself
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   using it.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:12.440]   There's been stuff out there before like Superglue, which I'm not sure even exists anymore,
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:15.000]   which is a site where you could point it at a bunch of feeds and then it would make
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.080]   one page that would assemble all that.
[00:06:18.080 --> 00:06:24.960]   I think for somewhere between the complete geeks and the standard users, just for a power
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.160]   user, this is the kind of thing where you could make some really interesting stuff.
[00:06:27.160 --> 00:06:28.160]   Look at the guy.
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.480]   Can you put it on a page when you're done, or do you have to go to the office site?
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:32.480]   You can give somebody's pipe.
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:33.480]   Somebody's pipe.
[00:06:33.480 --> 00:06:35.400]   It does come from Yahoo, though, doesn't it?
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:37.840]   But I think you can subscribe to it.
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:38.840]   So does an RSS feed?
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:39.840]   Yeah.
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:41.920]   So you can get an RSS feed out of the whole thing?
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:43.280]   So no way, let me get this straight.
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:44.720]   I can create a bunch of pipe.
[00:06:44.720 --> 00:06:49.120]   I can do an annual as much as I hate to turn mashup.
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:52.600]   I can take a bunch of these things and make some sort of a mess.
[00:06:52.600 --> 00:06:53.920]   Let's put it that way.
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:57.880]   And then I can make that into an RSS feed and then I can subscribe to that RSS feed.
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:01.560]   And I can put that RSS feed on my blog over on the right-hand side where I can put RSS
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:02.560]   feeds.
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:03.560]   I can?
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:04.560]   Yeah.
[00:07:04.560 --> 00:07:06.920]   Jason Kallakannis is going to hate this.
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:12.240]   We just ran Twill with this week in law and he was railing against the idea of other people
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:18.560]   taking-- this is when he was still at AOL, but taking the feeds and making their own feeds
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:19.560]   out of them.
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.640]   But this is exactly what it is.
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:21.640]   Yeah.
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:25.800]   It might undermine the ability to monetize something.
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:26.800]   But the whole idea of RSS--
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:28.240]   I don't see how.
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:32.440]   You get the RSS and you're getting links back to wherever it is.
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.840]   I mean, it's the same link, which is to make how it's retrieved.
[00:07:35.840 --> 00:07:36.840]   It's very cool interface.
[00:07:36.840 --> 00:07:38.400]   You've got to play with the interface, Jason.
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:39.400]   I'm playing with it now.
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:40.400]   Yeah, it's really amazing.
[00:07:40.400 --> 00:07:44.280]   I think one of the coolest things about it, too, is that people will be able to take advantage
[00:07:44.280 --> 00:07:46.080]   of it without having to build a pipe.
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:47.080]   Right.
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:48.800]   There'll be a lot of pre-made pipes that you can configure.
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:53.920]   But if you want to, you can go in and modify it yourself and play with it.
[00:07:53.920 --> 00:07:59.360]   So the idea of creating your own newspaper that's always been out there where you pull
[00:07:59.360 --> 00:08:04.080]   in the best articles from the different sources is sort of a step closer to reality.
[00:08:04.080 --> 00:08:10.080]   But if you don't want stories about what's her name, you just--
[00:08:10.080 --> 00:08:11.080]   Ain the coldsmith.
[00:08:11.080 --> 00:08:12.080]   Yeah.
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:13.080]   You knew I had to--
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:14.080]   We're on a wavelength wheel.
[00:08:14.080 --> 00:08:17.080]   You could eliminate all the stories about Anacol Smith.
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.080]   Yeah.
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:19.080]   So you don't--
[00:08:19.080 --> 00:08:20.560]   Well, I'm putting these pipes together.
[00:08:20.560 --> 00:08:22.120]   Are these turtles coming after me?
[00:08:22.120 --> 00:08:23.640]   Is that going to happen?
[00:08:23.640 --> 00:08:24.640]   Turtles?
[00:08:24.640 --> 00:08:25.640]   Do you see turtles?
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:26.640]   Never mind.
[00:08:26.640 --> 00:08:27.640]   You just got to make sure--
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:28.640]   Somebody out there like this.
[00:08:28.640 --> 00:08:29.640]   That's an age mutant ninja turtles.
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:30.640]   Is that what you're talking about?
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:32.280]   I'm thinking of Mario and the pipes.
[00:08:32.280 --> 00:08:33.280]   Oh, OK.
[00:08:33.280 --> 00:08:37.280]   Well, you're just going to make sure your pipes don't get cloaked right later than the eggs.
[00:08:37.280 --> 00:08:38.280]   That's the tubes.
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:41.280]   So this actually does prove that Ted Stevens is right.
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:42.280]   Ted's a visionary.
[00:08:42.280 --> 00:08:43.280]   He was close.
[00:08:43.280 --> 00:08:45.280]   Maybe he knew Yahoo was up to this.
[00:08:45.280 --> 00:08:46.280]   There is a pipe.
[00:08:46.280 --> 00:08:47.280]   He was close.
[00:08:47.280 --> 00:08:51.280]   I think this is a very interesting thing that Yahoo has done.
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:52.280]   I subscribed to a service.
[00:08:52.280 --> 00:08:53.280]   It was called Dig Dot.
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.280]   And Kevin sued him.
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.880]   And now it's Dog Dot.
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:00.280]   But that aggregated dig and slash dot and delicious.
[00:09:00.280 --> 00:09:03.080]   And this would be easy trivial to do something like that.
[00:09:03.080 --> 00:09:04.080]   A lot of people are doing this.
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:05.480]   I'm not doing this right now inside my--
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:06.480]   Oh, sorry.
[00:09:06.480 --> 00:09:07.480]   Give us that.
[00:09:07.480 --> 00:09:08.480]   What was that again?
[00:09:08.480 --> 00:09:09.480]   You got a dot?
[00:09:09.480 --> 00:09:10.480]   Yeah.
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:13.280]   No, it's actually still D-I-G-G-D-O-T dot.
[00:09:13.280 --> 00:09:17.080]   God, US, I think.
[00:09:17.080 --> 00:09:18.080]   Let me see.
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:22.280]   I'll have to check it because I haven't been there in a while.
[00:09:22.280 --> 00:09:23.880]   See, that's an interesting thing.
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:24.880]   I don't go to their site.
[00:09:24.880 --> 00:09:26.880]   Do-G-G-D-O-T dot US.
[00:09:26.880 --> 00:09:27.880]   Dot US, yeah.
[00:09:27.880 --> 00:09:29.280]   I think dig dot still works.
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:30.680]   But Kevin got mad at him.
[00:09:30.680 --> 00:09:32.680]   And not Kevin personally.
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:35.680]   He's a team of lawyers that he has hired.
[00:09:35.680 --> 00:09:36.680]   So they had to change that.
[00:09:36.680 --> 00:09:38.680]   As many places that had the word dig in there.
[00:09:38.680 --> 00:09:39.680]   Title.
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:47.480]   So I guess the really the big story, besides the Ann and Nicole Smith story, is Steve Jobs
[00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:53.280]   really kind of surprising everybody by putting a essay right there on apple dot com saying,
[00:09:53.280 --> 00:09:56.480]   hey, a challenge to the record industry.
[00:09:56.480 --> 00:09:57.880]   You don't have to put copy protection in.
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.680]   You don't put it on CDs.
[00:09:59.680 --> 00:10:01.280]   Why are you putting it on digital music?
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.080]   Apple doesn't want you to do it.
[00:10:03.080 --> 00:10:04.080]   Stop.
[00:10:04.080 --> 00:10:05.880]   Yeah, he does it himself though.
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:07.480]   What's the way we get to know about it?
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:12.200]   He said, I think this is interesting because people I think have a long time.
[00:10:12.200 --> 00:10:17.320]   I am one of them have assumed that the reason apple loves DRM is it forces people to use
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:20.880]   the iPod when they buy songs from the iTunes music store it.
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:23.120]   It preserves their monopoly.
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:26.760]   He says, no, we do it because it's in our contracts with the record companies from day
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:27.760]   one.
[00:10:27.760 --> 00:10:28.760]   They insisted on it.
[00:10:28.760 --> 00:10:32.000]   Well, there's a discrepancy of information here.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:33.880]   That's what I thought too.
[00:10:33.880 --> 00:10:39.120]   But I was on the fact I was scheduled to do a CNBC thing, but I just didn't work out because
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.960]   we lost our line.
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:45.560]   I listened in on what's a roising, the one that used to be the head of the RIAA.
[00:10:45.560 --> 00:10:46.560]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:47.560]   No, not Heidi, the other.
[00:10:47.560 --> 00:10:48.560]   Rosie Rosen.
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:49.560]   Hillary Rosen.
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:50.560]   Hillary Rosen.
[00:10:50.560 --> 00:10:53.800]   She said that's not true.
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:10:58.400]   She said that Steve should get off the pot if he wants to cut it loose.
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:10:59.400]   That's what she said.
[00:10:59.400 --> 00:11:01.080]   Well, he could for indie labels.
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:05.640]   I mean, there are plenty of indie labels who would like to sell on DRM music on iTunes,
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:08.000]   but they're told they can't, but they have to have it DRM.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   There you have it.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:10.160]   Larry Lessig made that point right away.
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:11.880]   He said, OK, Steve, put up her shut up.
[00:11:11.880 --> 00:11:14.040]   Let's see you on DRM.
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:15.760]   Those artists that don't want it.
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:18.000]   What about what about the stuff that apple puts up?
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:19.840]   I mean, stuff like his keynote address.
[00:11:19.840 --> 00:11:21.960]   Does that have those on copy protected now?
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:22.960]   That's just a pure street.
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:23.960]   Yeah.
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:27.880]   And he has not, I might point out at any time suggested that they take the DRM out of the
[00:11:27.880 --> 00:11:29.760]   TV shows in the movies they sell.
[00:11:29.760 --> 00:11:31.760]   No, that's interesting.
[00:11:31.760 --> 00:11:35.880]   But I think, you know, what this is obviously a response to Norway and France saying, you
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:37.960]   know, you've got to open up the iPod.
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:42.360]   He says, we can't open it up because the record companies won't let us open it up from day
[00:11:42.360 --> 00:11:43.360]   one.
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:46.240]   Not only did they insist on copy protection, they insisted on a system that if it were
[00:11:46.240 --> 00:11:50.800]   cracked, which it has been several times, could be fixed within weeks.
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:52.680]   He says copy this actually, I thought this was great.
[00:11:52.680 --> 00:11:55.480]   He says DRM doesn't work.
[00:11:55.480 --> 00:11:59.160]   He says the record companies already release their music without DRM.
[00:11:59.160 --> 00:12:02.520]   In fact, most music is sold that way.
[00:12:02.520 --> 00:12:04.200]   Let us, you know, let your music free.
[00:12:04.200 --> 00:12:09.240]   I mean, does anybody else think this is just like a negotiating tactic?
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:13.200]   Like, we all know that the record labels, you know, they're pushing for more and more
[00:12:13.200 --> 00:12:14.200]   and more.
[00:12:14.200 --> 00:12:17.160]   They've got the, you know, universal, it's got it zoom deal to get its cut or whatever.
[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:20.920]   And we, I think there's a quote, wasn't there, that the universal guy was saying, well, now
[00:12:20.920 --> 00:12:23.320]   maybe we get this with apple and the iPod.
[00:12:23.320 --> 00:12:28.240]   And I think this is just Steve sort of like pushing back in the other direction and saying,
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:33.240]   okay, so you want a kind of iPod sales and we want you to, you know, release all your
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:35.160]   music with no DRM.
[00:12:35.160 --> 00:12:39.440]   Maybe the final position is we just carry on as we are, which suits apple quite fine.
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:40.440]   Thank you very much.
[00:12:40.440 --> 00:12:45.000]   Well, I don't think the record companies have to sick cave to Steve.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.480]   I think that Steve makes a point.
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:48.880]   I think a lot of others observed it wouldn't hurt.
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:51.240]   Would it hurt apple to get rid of the copy protection?
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.520]   We already have a monopoly.
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:54.600]   It's not going to, they don't need it anymore.
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.240]   And it certainly would make consumers happier.
[00:12:56.240 --> 00:12:58.200]   And wouldn't you buy more music?
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.840]   I think they'd sell a lot more music.
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.960]   It may hurt them on the device side.
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:06.120]   Maybe there's an argument to be made that, that people wouldn't buy an iPod if they didn't
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:09.000]   have to to shop at the iTunes music store.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.640]   But I think a lot more people would also shop at the iTunes music store because I don't.
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:15.560]   I never buy music.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.760]   Probably increase iPod sales for all we know.
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:21.160]   You think they're dominant because it's the best player.
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:23.400]   Because you have to have it to shop at iTunes.
[00:13:23.400 --> 00:13:28.520]   What it amounts to now is it makes him look like, it's classic Steve in the sense that
[00:13:28.520 --> 00:13:32.600]   he comes out there and he re-grabs control of the conversation and puts everybody else
[00:13:32.600 --> 00:13:33.600]   on the defense.
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:34.760]   So now he's the good guy.
[00:13:34.760 --> 00:13:35.760]   That's right.
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:38.640]   Now he's the good guy looking out for the consumers and he's going to leave it to everybody
[00:13:38.640 --> 00:13:40.360]   else to just go find it out.
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:41.360]   Do you think he-
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:45.240]   I don't mean to jump ahead in the conversation too far, but do you think he knew about EMI's
[00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.720]   announcement when he put his posting up?
[00:13:47.720 --> 00:13:48.720]   According to the Chicago-
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:49.720]   Or it's not even an announcement, it's a leak.
[00:13:49.720 --> 00:13:54.440]   According to the Chicago Sun Times, EMI has been pitching the possibility of selling its
[00:13:54.440 --> 00:14:00.640]   entire music collection to the public in MP3 unprotected.
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.920]   According to the article, several other major music companies have considered the same route,
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:09.640]   but none have gone as far as EMI has.
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:13.480]   Now first of all, doesn't say what bit rate MP3.
[00:14:13.480 --> 00:14:19.480]   The record companies have historically done things like 96 kilobits MP3.
[00:14:19.480 --> 00:14:24.040]   And if you want the good version, you're going to have to have DRM.
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:25.440]   They're the third largest music company.
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:29.840]   They have the Beatles, lots of artists.
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:33.480]   Nora Jones, it would be-
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:34.480]   Here's the issue.
[00:14:34.480 --> 00:14:35.480]   Is this the-
[00:14:35.480 --> 00:14:36.480]   Well, they have quite a few.
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:37.480]   The Beastie Boys.
[00:14:37.480 --> 00:14:38.480]   I know, I know.
[00:14:38.480 --> 00:14:39.480]   J. Guiles Bay.
[00:14:39.480 --> 00:14:40.480]   Yes.
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:42.480]   It's a bunch of dinosaurs you're mentioning.
[00:14:42.480 --> 00:14:43.480]   My love blood ran low.
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:45.000]   The kids are going to the indie stuff.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   Come on.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.480]   My memories have just been sold.
[00:14:48.480 --> 00:14:49.480]   Da, da, da, da.
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:56.080]   Anyway, I think that frankly this is the beginning of the crack in the DRM iceberg.
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:14:57.080]   It's almost-
[00:14:57.080 --> 00:15:00.480]   It's going to melt faster than the sheets of ice in Greenland.
[00:15:00.480 --> 00:15:06.920]   Well, he's done a lot to raise awareness of DRM amongst the general public, isn't he,
[00:15:06.920 --> 00:15:07.920]   with this?
[00:15:07.920 --> 00:15:09.400]   Because it's been all over the mainstream media.
[00:15:09.400 --> 00:15:14.000]   And how many DRM stories do you see in the mainstream media?
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:15.840]   Well, yeah, exactly.
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:18.560]   And I'll tell you, I was at the front page of every newspaper.
[00:15:18.560 --> 00:15:20.240]   I got called by radio stations.
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:23.440]   I mean, this brought the issue very much to the foreground.
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:28.200]   Okay, so what do we conclude here since we're languishing?
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:29.200]   Are we languishing?
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:30.200]   That's what I think.
[00:15:30.200 --> 00:15:31.200]   Are we concluding?
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:32.200]   What do we-
[00:15:32.200 --> 00:15:33.200]   Well, I would hope-
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:34.460]   Well, okay, here's my questions for you.
[00:15:34.460 --> 00:15:37.160]   Would removing DRM hurt Apple in any way?
[00:15:37.160 --> 00:15:38.160]   Yeah.
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:39.760]   Would it be good for music sales?
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:40.760]   Yes.
[00:15:40.760 --> 00:15:41.760]   Yes.
[00:15:41.760 --> 00:15:42.760]   Here's the tough one.
[00:15:42.760 --> 00:15:45.820]   Now, Steve asserts it wouldn't hurt the record companies either because it doesn't
[00:15:45.820 --> 00:15:46.820]   work.
[00:15:46.820 --> 00:15:48.800]   Would it hurt the record companies to remove copy protection?
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:49.800]   No.
[00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:52.760]   Does anybody believe it would besides the record companies?
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:53.760]   No, it wouldn't.
[00:15:53.760 --> 00:15:54.760]   Why would it?
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:55.760]   Why would it?
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:59.000]   There already- if you don't want copy protection, you just buy a CD.
[00:15:59.000 --> 00:16:01.280]   And how on earth can it increase piracy?
[00:16:01.280 --> 00:16:03.240]   Piracy has already evolved to majority.
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.960]   It can only go down.
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:06.520]   I totally agree with that.
[00:16:06.520 --> 00:16:11.560]   I mean, right now they're competing with free pirated music by putting out broken music.
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:15.800]   So how would changing it to unbroken music that is easily available to everyone?
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:16.800]   It hurt them.
[00:16:16.800 --> 00:16:17.800]   Yeah.
[00:16:17.800 --> 00:16:19.500]   And getting sales to go up.
[00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:24.300]   Copy protection is about to fail, to be phased out.
[00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:25.300]   We've saw it once before.
[00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:29.820]   Remember, there was in the early days of computing software, a lot of stuff was copy
[00:16:29.820 --> 00:16:30.820]   protection.
[00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:31.820]   Oh, yeah.
[00:16:31.820 --> 00:16:32.820]   Almost everything.
[00:16:32.820 --> 00:16:36.460]   And they realized it's not doing any good and it's just pissing off our customers.
[00:16:36.460 --> 00:16:39.860]   It's really, I mean, increasingly it's just something that's just a hindrance for the
[00:16:39.860 --> 00:16:43.100]   honest consumer who's actually spending the money.
[00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:46.540]   So Steve's going to come out of this smelling like a rose.
[00:16:46.540 --> 00:16:51.300]   He's going to be the guy who pushed, you know, blew the Trump a lot.
[00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:52.780]   Another thing is he has.
[00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:57.020]   Another thing is interesting though, I think it's going to continue to increase the rift
[00:16:57.020 --> 00:17:01.060]   we start to see between the future for artists and the future for labels.
[00:17:01.060 --> 00:17:04.340]   Because the people who are going to be hurt potentially, I mean, I'm not saying they will
[00:17:04.340 --> 00:17:07.420]   be, but if anybody could be hurt, I think it's going to be the labels with that.
[00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:09.940]   I think it's going to be great for artists if they do it.
[00:17:09.940 --> 00:17:11.940]   Just because there's going to be so much easier to get to get to the artist.
[00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:13.180]   I mean, I'm worried about this.
[00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:14.180]   A lot of artists.
[00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:17.620]   Yeah, you know, there's layers of artists.
[00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:21.020]   I mean, there's high-end artists that make up, you know, millions.
[00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:22.940]   Tylenka doesn't like this.
[00:17:22.940 --> 00:17:26.540]   There's a certain layer of artists that think that they're just being ripped.
[00:17:26.540 --> 00:17:29.780]   They just really see themselves as the, there's two kinds.
[00:17:29.780 --> 00:17:31.300]   One of them is a big group like Metallica.
[00:17:31.300 --> 00:17:34.860]   They see themselves as the center of the universe and then people stealing their music.
[00:17:34.860 --> 00:17:38.700]   And then there's the small artists that sell the very, you know, they don't really have
[00:17:38.700 --> 00:17:44.700]   a lot of sales and then they see that everybody who takes a song is literally taking money
[00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:48.300]   from their pockets because they're really don't, they're not doing a big business.
[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.260]   And those are the artists that complain the most.
[00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:55.740]   Well, and I haven't the studies shown that the people who benefit from free MP3s the
[00:17:55.740 --> 00:17:58.900]   most are the smaller artists.
[00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:03.220]   If anybody stands to lose from, from piracy, it's the larger artists who really do sell
[00:18:03.220 --> 00:18:07.660]   a lot, but the small artists actually benefit because it gets their name out there and they
[00:18:07.660 --> 00:18:10.140]   benefit from people becoming aware of them.
[00:18:10.140 --> 00:18:13.460]   Well, there's all services now that you can hire that will go out there and basically
[00:18:13.460 --> 00:18:17.420]   scrape the P2P networks to give you the equivalent of a billboard chart.
[00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:21.420]   And you know, if you don't think for a minute that the labels are not out there hiring people
[00:18:21.420 --> 00:18:22.620]   to go and watch that stuff.
[00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:25.620]   And if you go out and do a P2P search, you know, you're going to find, sure you're going
[00:18:25.620 --> 00:18:28.740]   to find some indie artists, but by and large, you're going to find the big fat part of that
[00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:31.740]   curve is going to be the Britney Spearses of the world that are out there.
[00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:35.220]   So like, you know, like I think was Will said, the toothpaste is out of the tube at this
[00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:36.220]   point.
[00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:37.900]   It's been a bad week for the recording industry.
[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:46.620]   The RIAA got slapped by a judge who is going to award attorney fees to one of the plaintiffs
[00:18:46.620 --> 00:18:51.100]   in a RIAA versus thief lawsuit.
[00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:53.980]   Yeah, yeah, the thief aka Grandma.
[00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:59.140]   Grandma Debbie Foster, an Oklahoma woman who says, I don't know what this is all about.
[00:18:59.140 --> 00:19:00.140]   Why are you bothering me?
[00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:04.980]   Now it turns out her daughter probably was up, was up to no good.
[00:19:04.980 --> 00:19:06.900]   And that's what the record companies say.
[00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:11.940]   However, when they found that out, they didn't drop Ms. Lee from the loss or Ms. Foster from
[00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:12.940]   the lawsuit.
[00:19:12.940 --> 00:19:15.020]   They, they kept her in.
[00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:18.700]   Yeah, too much too much effort to like make those changes.
[00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:24.540]   Judge Lee R. West dismissed the original lawsuit and the counterclaim ruled that Foster
[00:19:24.540 --> 00:19:30.260]   was the prevailing party and said, and you get attorney's fees.
[00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:34.700]   So the RIAA, this is, they call this driftnet lawsuits because they just try to pull in
[00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:38.980]   everybody and they don't care who gets bit by it.
[00:19:38.980 --> 00:19:44.500]   RIAA says, we respectfully believe the court got it wrong.
[00:19:44.500 --> 00:19:49.380]   They can respectfully, respectfully, jump up in their chest.
[00:19:49.380 --> 00:19:53.100]   With the judicial system today, people like that that abuse the system.
[00:19:53.100 --> 00:19:55.540]   It is inexcusable.
[00:19:55.540 --> 00:20:01.820]   So really the question, and I think it is, is, is this kind of cast some pollen, the
[00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:07.940]   RIAA's techniques, $50,000 in attorneys fees is in a big deal for the RIAA.
[00:20:07.940 --> 00:20:09.380]   Yeah, I'm dropping a bucket for them.
[00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:10.380]   They'll keep doing it, right?
[00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:14.220]   Yeah, but times that by the thousands of people that are suing and it's not to get
[00:20:14.220 --> 00:20:15.420]   not insignificant.
[00:20:15.420 --> 00:20:16.420]   The daughter settled.
[00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:19.020]   What's the mom who fought on?
[00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:21.580]   The daughter said, well, she got a default judgment.
[00:20:21.580 --> 00:20:22.580]   Let's put it that way.
[00:20:22.580 --> 00:20:23.980]   She didn't, she didn't contest it.
[00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:27.100]   I think, you know, I think they'll keep going with this because they figure most of the
[00:20:27.100 --> 00:20:30.780]   people there after are guilty of something in the eyes of the law.
[00:20:30.780 --> 00:20:32.500]   And so they'll prevail most of the time.
[00:20:32.500 --> 00:20:35.380]   And every once in a while they might have to drop 50K, but it won't happen often enough
[00:20:35.380 --> 00:20:36.380]   to deter them.
[00:20:36.380 --> 00:20:39.940]   Well, and it's really not the point of it, isn't the people they, they pull in in these
[00:20:39.940 --> 00:20:40.940]   drift nets.
[00:20:40.940 --> 00:20:43.540]   It's to, it's to send a strong message to the rest of the world.
[00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:47.740]   Hey, you know, you could get in trouble for this and don't do it.
[00:20:47.740 --> 00:20:49.820]   And I think it, you know, it's the carrot and the stick.
[00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:52.660]   It's a reasonable stick, don't you think?
[00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:54.540]   They claim it's been working.
[00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:56.220]   I don't see any evidence of that.
[00:20:56.220 --> 00:20:59.780]   Well, but there's the same side they claim that piracy is on the rise.
[00:20:59.780 --> 00:21:01.220]   That's why they need DRM.
[00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:04.380]   It's working, but not working too well.
[00:21:04.380 --> 00:21:06.380]   Not that well.
[00:21:06.380 --> 00:21:07.380]   So I love this one.
[00:21:07.380 --> 00:21:12.900]   Kodak says that if, you know, I've never really done this calculation, but they estimate
[00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:18.900]   that the cost of ink for inkjet printers when you buy the cartridges around four or $5,000
[00:21:18.900 --> 00:21:19.900]   a gallon.
[00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:20.900]   Wow.
[00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:24.340]   That's more expensive than Starbucks.
[00:21:24.340 --> 00:21:26.820]   And so they're going to charge 90 on their new printers.
[00:21:26.820 --> 00:21:32.580]   You have to use a Kodak printer, $9.99 for black, $14.99 for color.
[00:21:32.580 --> 00:21:35.100]   It's one way to get attention and get people to buy your printers.
[00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:37.860]   I don't know if they're any good printers, but wow.
[00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:38.860]   Seems high.
[00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:41.500]   $5,000 a gallon.
[00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:43.580]   Well, there's not a lot of ink in those inkjet cartridges.
[00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:46.860]   When you put it that way, it doesn't seem like a ripoff, doesn't it?
[00:21:46.860 --> 00:21:50.620]   And especially because they love some of them, all the sort of fancy ones that have chips
[00:21:50.620 --> 00:21:52.340]   in to tell you how full they are.
[00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:53.340]   Or are they all too...
[00:21:53.340 --> 00:21:56.580]   They're empty and you can't use it with the still stuff left in it.
[00:21:56.580 --> 00:21:59.820]   Is anybody else here buying those totally cheap off-brand?
[00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:00.820]   Hell yes.
[00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:05.820]   I mean, the difference in price is unbelievable and I don't see a bit of difference.
[00:22:05.820 --> 00:22:06.820]   They're only 2,000.
[00:22:06.820 --> 00:22:09.700]   I buy the off-brand for some printers and other printers I don't.
[00:22:09.700 --> 00:22:11.820]   It depends on the printer what I use it for.
[00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:14.300]   Yeah, I always try to get the off-brand if I can.
[00:22:14.300 --> 00:22:15.300]   Absolutely.
[00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:18.140]   Well, you have to find a good off-brand.
[00:22:18.140 --> 00:22:19.140]   I don't know.
[00:22:19.140 --> 00:22:24.500]   Maybe it was BS, but I had a lecture at one of these Macintosh shows from one of these
[00:22:24.500 --> 00:22:28.260]   guys who sells off brands and he says, "Some of this stuff is crap."
[00:22:28.260 --> 00:22:30.420]   Well, some of the major stuff is crap.
[00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:34.980]   I mean, I don't know how many of the real thing I've used that break or say they're
[00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:36.140]   empty when they're half full.
[00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:38.540]   I mean, it's kind of a crap shoot anyway.
[00:22:38.540 --> 00:22:41.620]   I always buy the house, the label.
[00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:44.060]   Yeah, but you got the money.
[00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:45.060]   We have to...
[00:22:45.060 --> 00:22:47.500]   I just feel like it's just, you know, I don't want to deal with a house.
[00:22:47.500 --> 00:22:51.420]   And then there's of course the people who use the hypodermic needles to inject new ink
[00:22:51.420 --> 00:22:52.420]   or that.
[00:22:52.420 --> 00:22:53.420]   Man, what a mess.
[00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:56.420]   Yeah, that goes into life's too short, Colin.
[00:22:56.420 --> 00:23:01.580]   Well, John, I think you had something in your DRM call about how your time is worth
[00:23:01.580 --> 00:23:04.660]   more than it takes to go out and find DRM music.
[00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:08.220]   It's definitely your time is worth more than spending time injecting...
[00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:11.020]   It's going to spread newspapers all over the table.
[00:23:11.020 --> 00:23:13.540]   ...and then getting it, then having to clean it up.
[00:23:13.540 --> 00:23:15.620]   Ruined a good pair of pants, that way.
[00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:19.180]   It's so funny, though, that the Polaroid model kind of works for some kinds of things.
[00:23:19.180 --> 00:23:23.020]   Like I'm pretty addicted to a certain Gillette razor that I wish I wasn't paying so much
[00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:25.580]   for, but I feel like I get a lot more out of it.
[00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:28.900]   Paying $15 or $20 for any inkjet replacement.
[00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:30.260]   I don't get a lot of joy out of that.
[00:23:30.260 --> 00:23:31.500]   I'm not getting value out of that.
[00:23:31.500 --> 00:23:33.380]   You know, I was watching the Saturday...
[00:23:33.380 --> 00:23:37.100]   They finally released the first year of Saturday Night Live as a DVD.
[00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:41.260]   It's very educational, but one of the things they do in one of the first few episodes is
[00:23:41.260 --> 00:23:45.740]   they mock the Gillette mock two razor, the two blade razor.
[00:23:45.740 --> 00:23:47.740]   They sit with a three blade razor.
[00:23:47.740 --> 00:23:49.780]   Now this is 1974.
[00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:50.780]   And they just...
[00:23:50.780 --> 00:23:52.980]   And they get a lot of comedy value out of the fact that no idiot...
[00:23:52.980 --> 00:23:54.540]   It would buy a three blade razor.
[00:23:54.540 --> 00:23:55.780]   Well, of course, what is it?
[00:23:55.780 --> 00:23:56.780]   Five now?
[00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:57.780]   You could buy five blade raves.
[00:23:57.780 --> 00:23:58.780]   Fourteen, I think.
[00:23:58.780 --> 00:23:59.780]   With one on the back.
[00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:00.780]   Yeah.
[00:24:00.780 --> 00:24:01.780]   There's one on the back.
[00:24:01.780 --> 00:24:02.780]   One on the back.
[00:24:02.780 --> 00:24:04.580]   I bought the one with the vibrator built in.
[00:24:04.580 --> 00:24:06.500]   I thought two for one.
[00:24:06.500 --> 00:24:08.500]   And actually it does work.
[00:24:08.500 --> 00:24:09.500]   It does work.
[00:24:09.500 --> 00:24:11.460]   You're about to shave or leave?
[00:24:11.460 --> 00:24:14.980]   No, literally it has a battery in it.
[00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:15.980]   What is it?
[00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:16.980]   That's a woman's one, isn't it?
[00:24:16.980 --> 00:24:17.980]   No, it's not.
[00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:19.780]   It's got the manly design.
[00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:21.380]   They have a pink one for women, but it's got...
[00:24:21.380 --> 00:24:23.580]   It's the extreme Mac 4 or something.
[00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:25.980]   Yeah, silver and orange and I have one.
[00:24:25.980 --> 00:24:27.380]   It's got four or five blades.
[00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:28.380]   It's got a...
[00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:29.380]   I mean, what...
[00:24:29.380 --> 00:24:31.300]   I guess it's tough to think of new reasons to buy it.
[00:24:31.300 --> 00:24:34.740]   My hotel left me one of those for free when I was at CES.
[00:24:34.740 --> 00:24:35.740]   Wow.
[00:24:35.740 --> 00:24:36.740]   And I tried it.
[00:24:36.740 --> 00:24:37.740]   I don't understand what the vibrating does.
[00:24:37.740 --> 00:24:38.740]   I know either.
[00:24:38.740 --> 00:24:41.380]   I thought it was going to cut me up when I used it.
[00:24:41.380 --> 00:24:42.380]   It's turned to...
[00:24:42.380 --> 00:24:43.380]   It's to wake you up.
[00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:46.180]   The guys are missing the point, but that's better still.
[00:24:46.180 --> 00:24:49.220]   I just feel good afterwards.
[00:24:49.220 --> 00:24:52.540]   It's the only razor with a happy ending built in.
[00:24:52.540 --> 00:24:53.540]   Senator...
[00:24:53.540 --> 00:24:54.540]   Whoa.
[00:24:54.540 --> 00:24:55.540]   Next.
[00:24:55.540 --> 00:25:02.580]   State Senator Carl Kruger of New York State is going to introduce a cornet.
[00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:03.580]   This is true.
[00:25:03.580 --> 00:25:04.580]   It's cornet@techshot.com.
[00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:08.500]   Going to introduce legislation that would ban the use of handheld devices like Blackberry's
[00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:12.180]   iPods and portable video games while crossing streets in New York City.
[00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:13.180]   Yeah, it's true.
[00:25:13.180 --> 00:25:14.380]   We reported it on news.com too.
[00:25:14.380 --> 00:25:16.380]   He has proposed the bill.
[00:25:16.380 --> 00:25:17.940]   Well, I think it's right.
[00:25:17.940 --> 00:25:19.940]   Because I mean, that's dangerous.
[00:25:19.940 --> 00:25:23.340]   Well, apparently this guy does this to get attention.
[00:25:23.340 --> 00:25:26.580]   So one of the listeners of Buzz out loud wrote in and said he always proposes these
[00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:27.580]   wacky bills.
[00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:31.660]   He never gets any of them, any serious consideration.
[00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:32.660]   But come on.
[00:25:32.660 --> 00:25:37.500]   It says three pedestrians were accidentally killed in Brooklyn since September 2006,
[00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:41.460]   stepping into traffic because they had an electronic gadget, even though bystanders were
[00:25:41.460 --> 00:25:44.220]   screaming, "Watch out!"
[00:25:44.220 --> 00:25:46.220]   iPods don't kill people.
[00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:48.460]   The idiots get killed.
[00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:51.980]   What are you supposed to take off the iPod when you get to the street and put it back
[00:25:51.980 --> 00:25:53.140]   on when you get across?
[00:25:53.140 --> 00:25:54.660]   You should pay attention.
[00:25:54.660 --> 00:25:56.820]   I mean, whether you're wearing an iPod or not.
[00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:57.820]   You should pay attention.
[00:25:57.820 --> 00:25:58.820]   It's not the iPod.
[00:25:58.820 --> 00:25:59.820]   It's the Blackberries.
[00:25:59.820 --> 00:26:00.820]   And I'm as bad as anybody.
[00:26:00.820 --> 00:26:02.940]   But how many, you know, I mean, really seriously.
[00:26:02.940 --> 00:26:03.940]   Blackberries.
[00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:05.820]   I've actually walked into walls.
[00:26:05.820 --> 00:26:09.940]   There needs to be some sort of a 12-step program about Blackberries.
[00:26:09.940 --> 00:26:14.700]   Well, now you combine Twitter with my Blackberry and I actually can't stop typing.
[00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:16.500]   And you're a multiple device guy.
[00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:17.500]   That's the thing that gets me.
[00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:18.500]   It's not like you've just got the Blackberry.
[00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:26.860]   You've got this like Chewbacca bandolier full of electronic devices you're always checking.
[00:26:26.860 --> 00:26:28.460]   That was awesome.
[00:26:28.460 --> 00:26:30.460]   Thank you very much.
[00:26:30.460 --> 00:26:31.460]   Next.
[00:26:31.460 --> 00:26:32.460]   Next.
[00:26:32.460 --> 00:26:34.300]   Did anybody see Bill Gates on the Daily Show?
[00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:35.300]   Oh, yeah.
[00:26:35.300 --> 00:26:36.300]   I did.
[00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:37.300]   Did you see the real cool thing?
[00:26:37.300 --> 00:26:38.300]   The cool thing from YouTube.
[00:26:38.300 --> 00:26:39.300]   Was he good?
[00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:40.300]   No.
[00:26:40.300 --> 00:26:41.300]   No, he wasn't.
[00:26:41.300 --> 00:26:42.780]   He was sleeping about halfway through.
[00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:43.940]   He was pretty nervous.
[00:26:43.940 --> 00:26:47.420]   And then the next day, if you didn't see that, that was the best part because then they ridiculed
[00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:48.420]   him.
[00:26:48.420 --> 00:26:49.620]   The Daily Show ridiculed him?
[00:26:49.620 --> 00:26:51.020]   Well, at the end of the show--
[00:26:51.020 --> 00:26:53.460]   Has he had enough guts to ridicule him in person?
[00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:56.900]   Well, no, because what happened on the show-- and I don't know whether or not this was
[00:26:56.900 --> 00:27:00.980]   planned or what-- but Gates gets up at the end of his little presentation.
[00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:03.500]   You know, the rapport between the two wasn't that good.
[00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:07.820]   And Gates had that kind of fake smile half the time, which is always annoying.
[00:27:07.820 --> 00:27:10.660]   And he gets up and walks off this stage before he shakes.
[00:27:10.660 --> 00:27:12.620]   Then he shakes hands or he just leaves.
[00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:15.500]   Let's play a little clip with John Stewart talking about this.
[00:27:15.500 --> 00:27:16.500]   The program last night.
[00:27:16.500 --> 00:27:17.820]   I guess it was Microsoft Chairman Bill Gates.
[00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:21.700]   And I don't know if you noticed, but he left in a bit of a hurry.
[00:27:21.700 --> 00:27:22.700]   Take a look at the footage.
[00:27:22.700 --> 00:27:23.700]   Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:27:23.700 --> 00:27:24.700]   We really appreciate it.
[00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:25.700]   Thank you.
[00:27:25.700 --> 00:27:26.700]   He's walking off.
[00:27:26.700 --> 00:27:27.700]   He's just sleeping.
[00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:28.700]   He's just wheezing.
[00:27:28.700 --> 00:27:37.580]   Now, stop that for a second.
[00:27:37.580 --> 00:27:38.580]   So what happened?
[00:27:38.580 --> 00:27:40.740]   Whoops, you got me on a look there.
[00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:44.260]   So what happens the next day, they do a bit.
[00:27:44.260 --> 00:27:45.260]   That's what's going on.
[00:27:45.260 --> 00:27:47.980]   A lot of people seem to have missed this because I talked to people Wagner Edserman.
[00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:49.660]   Nobody saw this, but it was hilarious.
[00:27:49.660 --> 00:27:54.180]   At the end of the show, they said, yeah, yesterday Bill walked off the stage and you
[00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:55.180]   missed the end of it.
[00:27:55.180 --> 00:28:01.700]   And so then they have a phony bill walking down the hallway, pushing people over throwing
[00:28:01.700 --> 00:28:06.020]   stuff in the guy's face and calling another guy a weasel and pushing him down.
[00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:11.300]   And then also Bill can rush over to the microwave and get his popcorn.
[00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:12.300]   Oh, is that what it was?
[00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:14.500]   That is the cleaner version that we did for television.
[00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:17.300]   Here is what actually happened in the studio.
[00:28:17.300 --> 00:28:18.300]   Thank you so much for joining us.
[00:28:18.300 --> 00:28:19.300]   We really appreciate it.
[00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:24.380]   Bill Gates, Windows Vista, onc up.
[00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:26.340]   Bill Gates is an encounter to problem and needs to leave.
[00:28:26.340 --> 00:28:27.340]   We're sorry for the inconvenience.
[00:28:27.340 --> 00:28:28.340]   Really?
[00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:32.020]   The encounter to problem and he needed to leave.
[00:28:32.020 --> 00:28:33.020]   That was the error message.
[00:28:33.020 --> 00:28:37.620]   I guess this clip, this is YouTube of course, doesn't have the rest of it.
[00:28:37.620 --> 00:28:39.820]   Yeah, the rest of it is actually pretty funny.
[00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:42.780]   And it's always from the behind Bill.
[00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:47.100]   So, you know, and actually the guy who actually, the director, resembled him enough to make
[00:28:47.100 --> 00:28:48.100]   the thing kind of hilarious.
[00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:50.100]   Let me, oh I see, it's in the credits.
[00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:51.100]   Here, let me play it.
[00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:52.100]   Hey, he can't just leave.
[00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:53.100]   There he goes, he's walking.
[00:28:53.100 --> 00:28:54.100]   He doesn't look so smart.
[00:28:54.100 --> 00:28:55.100]   That's a lot of...
[00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:56.100]   That seconds to go, I gotta get there.
[00:28:56.100 --> 00:29:03.100]   A second to go, I gotta get there.
[00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:07.100]   Almost time to get the hell out of my way.
[00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:10.100]   Hey, and claw, activate.
[00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:11.100]   Successful.
[00:29:11.100 --> 00:29:12.100]   Door.
[00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:13.100]   Here, upgrade your shirt.
[00:29:13.100 --> 00:29:14.100]   I got a joke for ya.
[00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:15.100]   Hey, Gates, what the hell?
[00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:16.100]   Almost there seconds to go.
[00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:17.100]   I can smell it.
[00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:18.100]   Oh popcorn.
[00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:20.100]   You won't laugh at me.
[00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:25.100]   That is, that is very funny, I have to say.
[00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:27.100]   So Leo, are you playing that on YouTube?
[00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:30.100]   Cause isn't all the Viacom stuff supposed to be gone from YouTube?
[00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:33.100]   Well, I get it before it's gone.
[00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:34.100]   I don't know.
[00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:35.100]   That's cool.
[00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:36.100]   You'll like that.
[00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:38.100]   There's a story we need to discuss.
[00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:41.100]   Is Viacom that stupid?
[00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:45.100]   That they pull all the stuff off of YouTube when it's nothing more than free publicity?
[00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:47.100]   I mean, look what we just did.
[00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:49.100]   And I'm not gonna, what am I gonna go to the Viacom site and find it?
[00:29:49.100 --> 00:29:52.100]   No, I'm gonna go to YouTube and search for Bill Gates Daily Show, and there it is.
[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:54.100]   Well, that's what they're wanting people to do.
[00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:56.860]   Go to ComedyCentral.com and get the video there.
[00:29:56.860 --> 00:30:00.660]   And they're making it shareable so you can cut and paste and put it on MySpace so they
[00:30:00.660 --> 00:30:04.380]   figure they'll still get the free publicity, but they'll be in control of it.
[00:30:04.380 --> 00:30:06.660]   But you want a centralized place, that's the whole point.
[00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:11.380]   Well, the problem with course Tom is in that situation is that yeah, that's true.
[00:30:11.380 --> 00:30:14.980]   And it might be a good thing if you're very myopic, but the fact of the matter is when
[00:30:14.980 --> 00:30:17.060]   you're on YouTube, people might stumble upon this one.
[00:30:17.060 --> 00:30:19.700]   They're just doing a Bill Gates search for something else.
[00:30:19.700 --> 00:30:22.180]   They're not gonna do that at the other site because they're not gonna be at that other
[00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:23.180]   site.
[00:30:23.180 --> 00:30:27.620]   There are that many people that are cramped into one room which we'll call YouTube.
[00:30:27.620 --> 00:30:31.740]   I mean, you want to exploit that if you can because it's like, it's like, you know,
[00:30:31.740 --> 00:30:32.740]   what do they lose?
[00:30:32.740 --> 00:30:33.740]   And what do they lose?
[00:30:33.740 --> 00:30:34.740]   It's like foot traffic at a mall.
[00:30:34.740 --> 00:30:36.580]   I mean, you want to be where there's the most foot traffic.
[00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:37.580]   What do these people think?
[00:30:37.580 --> 00:30:40.020]   Do they even know what marketing is?
[00:30:40.020 --> 00:30:41.020]   I agree.
[00:30:41.020 --> 00:30:42.020]   And what have they lost?
[00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:45.740]   The banner ads on their ComedyCentral page, the chances of somebody might be like, they're
[00:30:45.740 --> 00:30:46.740]   all house ads.
[00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:49.020]   Pre-roll, pre-roll video ads, that's what they want.
[00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:51.420]   But they can put it in, that's so what they do is do what NBC does.
[00:30:51.420 --> 00:30:52.420]   Right.
[00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:53.940]   So, here you go YouTube.
[00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:55.140]   Here's our clips with our pre-roll.
[00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:56.620]   Yeah, I think it's myopic.
[00:30:56.620 --> 00:31:00.340]   I mean, I guess they're thinking they'll get as much out of my space out of YouTube, but
[00:31:00.340 --> 00:31:03.500]   there's still different audiences and they're just cutting one out.
[00:31:03.500 --> 00:31:05.300]   Yeah, no, it's just a blunder.
[00:31:05.300 --> 00:31:08.900]   They're cutting me out because I'm too lazy to actually search for this stuff.
[00:31:08.900 --> 00:31:11.300]   Although now with Google, you could pretty much find anything.
[00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:13.020]   You've heard about Google, right?
[00:31:13.020 --> 00:31:14.020]   No.
[00:31:14.020 --> 00:31:16.060]   No, what about Google?
[00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:17.060]   Video games.
[00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:18.780]   Just a joke.
[00:31:18.780 --> 00:31:20.900]   Wait, wait, is that a search engine?
[00:31:20.900 --> 00:31:21.900]   Yes.
[00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:22.900]   Absolutely.
[00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:26.620]   Video games are good for your eyes, Will Harris.
[00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:33.580]   US researchers have found that playing first person shooters far from making you blind will
[00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:34.780]   actually improve your vision.
[00:31:34.780 --> 00:31:38.180]   They studied people who played action games for a few hours a day over the course of a
[00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:41.780]   month, 20% improvement in their visual activity.
[00:31:41.780 --> 00:31:43.300]   Oh, I'm not buying this.
[00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:47.020]   My glasses say otherwise.
[00:31:47.020 --> 00:31:48.180]   That's not from video games.
[00:31:48.180 --> 00:31:49.980]   That's from something else.
[00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:53.660]   According to a professor of brain, look at this.
[00:31:53.660 --> 00:31:59.980]   Daphne Bavellier is a professor of brain and cognitive sciences, John.
[00:31:59.980 --> 00:32:11.020]   She's a professor and she's a professor and she says action video games, games play act.
[00:32:11.020 --> 00:32:15.060]   Well, she says it better than this, but she's easy for you to say action video gameplay.
[00:32:15.060 --> 00:32:17.060]   Oh, there's a problem.
[00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:21.300]   Here's the way our brains process visual information.
[00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:26.540]   These games push the human visual system to the limits and the brain adapts to it.
[00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:30.260]   The learning carries over to other activities and possibly everyday life as long as you
[00:32:30.260 --> 00:32:32.980]   don't cross the streets in New York City.
[00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:34.620]   So Viva pinata won't help.
[00:32:34.620 --> 00:32:36.620]   The years of war is great for your vision.
[00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:38.780]   The years of war is good for you, but not.
[00:32:38.780 --> 00:32:41.180]   So playing half life too.
[00:32:41.180 --> 00:32:42.940]   Is Viva pinata that good?
[00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:43.940]   Everybody seems to love it.
[00:32:43.940 --> 00:32:44.940]   I don't get it.
[00:32:44.940 --> 00:32:45.940]   What is Viva pinata?
[00:32:45.940 --> 00:32:47.940]   It's a Viva pinata game.
[00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:51.460]   Oh, it's like it's like a pokémon on steroids.
[00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:55.340]   Yeah, our animals like an Uber pokémon.
[00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:57.380]   So would a grown up enjoy this game?
[00:32:57.380 --> 00:32:58.380]   It's all right.
[00:32:58.380 --> 00:32:59.380]   Yeah.
[00:32:59.380 --> 00:33:00.900]   Did you just go for and loves it?
[00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:01.900]   Really?
[00:33:01.900 --> 00:33:02.900]   Mine too.
[00:33:02.900 --> 00:33:06.100]   My wife was a beat on you with a stick.
[00:33:06.100 --> 00:33:08.180]   Trying to get some in there, I guess.
[00:33:08.180 --> 00:33:09.180]   Okay.
[00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:10.900]   From the Daily Mail, that's from your country.
[00:33:10.900 --> 00:33:14.780]   Did you see this picture of the woman from Toshiba?
[00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:18.580]   No self-respecting person in this country reads the Daily Mail.
[00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:24.700]   You know, every time we blog something on the davork.org/blogblog, that's so you can
[00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:26.260]   have another drink.
[00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:31.580]   I get more hateful email in the comments from people from Britain saying nobody reads
[00:33:31.580 --> 00:33:32.580]   the Daily Mail.
[00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:33.580]   What do they make stuff up?
[00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:36.820]   How do these people stay in business if nobody reads the Daily Mail?
[00:33:36.820 --> 00:33:37.820]   Somebody reads it.
[00:33:37.820 --> 00:33:38.820]   Well, okay.
[00:33:38.820 --> 00:33:40.420]   Put it another way.
[00:33:40.420 --> 00:33:45.700]   Maybe in the demographic that's reading the davork.org/blog is reading the Daily Mail.
[00:33:45.700 --> 00:33:46.700]   Oh my god.
[00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:47.700]   And in a cold smith sheet.
[00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:48.700]   She died.
[00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:49.700]   Oh, wow.
[00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:51.700]   I saw it on the Daily Mail.
[00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:54.300]   The thing is though, okay, so, okay, this looks fake.
[00:33:54.300 --> 00:33:55.300]   It's probably fake.
[00:33:55.300 --> 00:33:56.500]   So this person has this thing on their head.
[00:33:56.500 --> 00:34:00.500]   So why are they in front of a big screen if they've got a wraparound TV screen inside
[00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:02.020]   their little toilet bowl headgear?
[00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:03.820]   Are you guys on the Daily Mail site?
[00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:04.820]   Yes.
[00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:05.820]   Well, can you describe it, Leo?
[00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:08.660]   It kind of looks like a big black robot toilet with a big bubble on the floor.
[00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:10.760]   They say it weighs three kilograms, which is--
[00:34:10.760 --> 00:34:13.020]   It's a Daily Mail.uk or what?
[00:34:13.020 --> 00:34:14.020]   There's a link in our delicious tags.
[00:34:14.020 --> 00:34:15.020]   Okay, okay.
[00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:16.020]   John.
[00:34:16.020 --> 00:34:17.020]   I didn't see it.
[00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:18.020]   Go back.
[00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:21.020]   One giant step for home entertainment is the title of the story.
[00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:22.020]   Yeah.
[00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:23.020]   Okay.
[00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:26.020]   Is this the way we'll be enjoying our television programs and computer games in the future?
[00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:27.940]   And this is a startling photo.
[00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:29.820]   A model is wearing a new gadget.
[00:34:29.820 --> 00:34:30.820]   You're a decanstion.
[00:34:30.820 --> 00:34:34.180]   The little party being joined in Australia.
[00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:35.180]   Oh my god.
[00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:38.180]   You know, the beautiful part is though, it only works on YouTube.
[00:34:38.180 --> 00:34:39.180]   I'm very, very--
[00:34:39.180 --> 00:34:40.180]   I'm vlogging that immediately.
[00:34:40.180 --> 00:34:43.380]   It only works on one player games because you'll never find a second person.
[00:34:43.380 --> 00:34:44.380]   But you can't even see it.
[00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:46.180]   You're going to die alone with that thing on your head.
[00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:47.780]   Yeah, from a broken neck.
[00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:48.780]   Help!
[00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:49.780]   It's not going to be a toilet.
[00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:52.700]   And you know, people are listening to the show wondering, what the heck?
[00:34:52.700 --> 00:34:59.100]   Well, it looks like a CRT monitor, like a huge 30-inch CRT monitor with a security camera
[00:34:59.100 --> 00:35:00.100]   front.
[00:35:00.100 --> 00:35:01.100]   Yes.
[00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:02.100]   On the other side.
[00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:03.100]   CCTV video.
[00:35:03.100 --> 00:35:07.500]   You've never seen the protesters in the '70s where they had this giant TV set on their
[00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:08.500]   head.
[00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:10.220]   This is kind of what we're talking about.
[00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:14.580]   Why is she going-- if she sat inside this massive immersive display, why is there a
[00:35:14.580 --> 00:35:15.580]   TV in front of her?
[00:35:15.580 --> 00:35:17.020]   Yeah, why is there a screen in front of her?
[00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:20.980]   She appears to be trying to look at the control through the toilet seat cover.
[00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:26.460]   And she's manipulating the trigger while she not watches what appears to be a desktop
[00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:27.460]   pattern of some kind of--
[00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:28.460]   It looks like clouds.
[00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:29.460]   And there's a camera.
[00:35:29.460 --> 00:35:31.180]   And there's a camera on her screen capturing her.
[00:35:31.180 --> 00:35:32.660]   A cloud game.
[00:35:32.660 --> 00:35:36.860]   You know what's odd is there are only-- you're right, nobody reads a Daily Mail.
[00:35:36.860 --> 00:35:40.420]   There are only seven comments on this story.
[00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:41.420]   So I think--
[00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:42.420]   Bus post.
[00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:43.420]   Really?
[00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:44.420]   One of them's first post.
[00:35:44.420 --> 00:35:47.300]   And it was posted on October 16.
[00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:48.540]   So there you go.
[00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:49.540]   Nobody does read the Daily Mail.
[00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:50.540]   Prove the--
[00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:51.540]   No, I guess they don't.
[00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:53.180]   Well, that's where you can get some exclusive stuff.
[00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:55.820]   And if you need to get Alex Lindsay to get one of these, I want to see Alex--
[00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:58.620]   If you look at the seven comments, four of them have been taken off.
[00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:01.300]   There's only three on there.
[00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:03.020]   So it's just the day-- you're right.
[00:36:03.020 --> 00:36:04.380]   You're right, the Daily Mail.
[00:36:04.380 --> 00:36:06.380]   Why isn't she listing the one side or another?
[00:36:06.380 --> 00:36:07.820]   No, Alex, it keeps her head up.
[00:36:07.820 --> 00:36:08.820]   We should have a contest.
[00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:11.660]   How many things are horribly horribly wrong with this photo?
[00:36:11.660 --> 00:36:12.660]   It's done.
[00:36:12.660 --> 00:36:14.780]   I'm putting it on the blog now.
[00:36:14.780 --> 00:36:15.780]   What's wrong with this picture?
[00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:16.780]   You think it's photoshopped?
[00:36:16.780 --> 00:36:18.620]   And worst of all, it's not even plugged in.
[00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:20.740]   It's not even plugged in.
[00:36:20.740 --> 00:36:23.500]   So hackers attempted to bring down the internet.
[00:36:23.500 --> 00:36:24.500]   Did you notice that?
[00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:25.500]   No.
[00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:26.500]   No, me neither.
[00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:29.020]   By the way, I bought that story, though, which is what we're talking about for people
[00:36:29.020 --> 00:36:34.060]   out there who want to know, is that DNS system has been under attack or was attacked recently.
[00:36:34.060 --> 00:36:39.940]   But according to Mark Perkel over at, see, computer time, who's my ISP, he says that
[00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:41.540]   this has been continuing.
[00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:43.580]   This has not-- hasn't stopped yet.
[00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:46.140]   And the big boys don't know quite what to do about.
[00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:49.340]   They've got it under control, but you're going to get a lot of outages.
[00:36:49.340 --> 00:36:52.740]   Actually, Steve Gibson has said this for some time, that this is the weak link on the internet.
[00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:54.580]   There are only 13 root servers.
[00:36:54.580 --> 00:37:00.860]   If you could attack all 13-- now, remember, the DNS is cached, but it's only cached for
[00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:02.100]   24 hours or so.
[00:37:02.100 --> 00:37:09.300]   So if you could attack all 13, bring them down for 24 hours, the internet would stop working.
[00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:12.460]   According to Mark, buy some really cool IP addresses.
[00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:17.220]   According to Mark, all these attacks are coming from China, North Korea, and some other
[00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:18.220]   agencies.
[00:37:18.220 --> 00:37:21.780]   Well, I don't know how you can tell, though, because that's just where the zombies live.
[00:37:21.780 --> 00:37:22.780]   You don't know who's--
[00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:23.780]   Well, that's what he says.
[00:37:23.780 --> 00:37:24.940]   It could be coming from the White House.
[00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:25.940]   We don't know.
[00:37:25.940 --> 00:37:28.900]   We don't know where the-- that's just the zombies.
[00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:30.420]   That's the problem with these attacks.
[00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:34.740]   The real problem is, as we mentioned a few weeks ago, as Vince Surf said, he estimated
[00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:41.060]   150 million computers, one quarter of all computers are owned by hackers or zombified.
[00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:42.060]   Right.
[00:37:42.060 --> 00:37:43.580]   And we all believe that number is low.
[00:37:43.580 --> 00:37:46.020]   So if that's the case, it wouldn't take much.
[00:37:46.020 --> 00:37:47.020]   And this is a real weak link.
[00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:49.380]   Now, I understand they're not going to try to upgrade these.
[00:37:49.380 --> 00:37:54.380]   But there is no solution, because these are legitimate requests.
[00:37:54.380 --> 00:37:56.460]   You can't refuse them.
[00:37:56.460 --> 00:37:57.460]   Or the thing won't work.
[00:37:57.460 --> 00:38:03.180]   I don't see whether somehow they can't track these guys down and put them in jail.
[00:38:03.180 --> 00:38:05.340]   That's just kind of the nature, I think, of the internet.
[00:38:05.340 --> 00:38:06.340]   This is kind of--
[00:38:06.340 --> 00:38:09.500]   I wonder if there's a way that the ISPs could monitor traffic outbound from their--
[00:38:09.500 --> 00:38:10.500]   Yeah, they can.
[00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:11.740]   In fact, that's the way to stop this.
[00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:13.380]   What it uses raw sockets.
[00:38:13.380 --> 00:38:16.140]   So it's spoofing the IP address.
[00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:19.460]   So all an ISP has to do is say, hey, that's not my IP address.
[00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:20.460]   Stop it.
[00:38:20.460 --> 00:38:24.540]   But-- and that, by the way, ISPs could stop spam, too.
[00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:29.220]   But the cost to business is so great that they don't do either.
[00:38:29.220 --> 00:38:31.100]   I don't know why, but maybe they ought to.
[00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:32.340]   How much does it cost?
[00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:36.860]   Well, I don't think it would cost much to say if the traffic doesn't come from my internet--
[00:38:36.860 --> 00:38:42.140]   you know, my pool of IP addresses, I'm not going to pass it along.
[00:38:42.140 --> 00:38:43.140]   Maybe that's why--
[00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:44.620]   You know what that's probably why--
[00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:46.220]   It's coming from China and South Korea.
[00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:51.340]   These are probably not well monitored.
[00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:54.580]   You just force everybody to use authenticates at SMTP.
[00:38:54.580 --> 00:38:56.780]   Well, for spam, you could, but that's another issue.
[00:38:56.780 --> 00:38:59.060]   That's a whole nother problem.
[00:38:59.060 --> 00:39:00.060]   But you're right.
[00:39:00.060 --> 00:39:04.580]   Yeah, I think every expert I've heard from says that if the internet service providers
[00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:07.380]   wanted to stop these kinds of attacks or spam, they could.
[00:39:07.380 --> 00:39:08.380]   We don't know.
[00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:10.220]   I'm not an expert enough to know that.
[00:39:10.220 --> 00:39:11.740]   If Veronica were here, we could ask her.
[00:39:11.740 --> 00:39:14.420]   They're too busy raking in the money.
[00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:17.540]   So what is-- do you know what I think about this quantum computing, John?
[00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:18.540]   This D-wave?
[00:39:18.540 --> 00:39:20.860]   This is coming gone a number of times into media.
[00:39:20.860 --> 00:39:23.660]   I mean, Markoff covers every so often.
[00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:25.260]   It seems bogus to me.
[00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:28.740]   Well, there's something legitimate about it, but I have no idea what.
[00:39:28.740 --> 00:39:31.740]   In February-- oh, that's now.
[00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:36.940]   Coming up February 13th in Mountain View, sorry, the registration is closed, and the
[00:39:36.940 --> 00:39:39.180]   15th in Vancouver registration is closed.
[00:39:39.180 --> 00:39:42.900]   So maybe-- I don't know, Tom, can you get down there and cover this?
[00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:47.340]   They're going to demonstrate these quantum computing systems.
[00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:48.340]   It's a Q-bit.
[00:39:48.340 --> 00:39:49.340]   I'm sorry.
[00:39:49.340 --> 00:39:51.900]   And that's one of the things that's different about quantum computing.
[00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:52.900]   They don't use--
[00:39:52.900 --> 00:39:53.900]   It's a Q-bit.
[00:39:53.900 --> 00:39:54.900]   A quantum-e-bit.
[00:39:54.900 --> 00:39:55.900]   It's a quantum-e-bit.
[00:39:55.900 --> 00:39:56.900]   Yeah.
[00:39:56.900 --> 00:39:59.380]   That's the way the quantum processor stores its information.
[00:39:59.380 --> 00:40:02.940]   It's in a superposition.
[00:40:02.940 --> 00:40:06.380]   It means that they're going to show off-- this demo that they'll show off will do two to
[00:40:06.380 --> 00:40:10.780]   the 16th calculations simultaneously.
[00:40:10.780 --> 00:40:14.420]   So 64,000 calculations a cycle.
[00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:16.820]   And I don't know how fast these computers are, but that's a lot.
[00:40:16.820 --> 00:40:18.700]   That's going to be a heck of a zombie.
[00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:24.460]   Well, you know the real hot story this week is the-- oh, whoops, whenever, wait a minute.
[00:40:24.460 --> 00:40:25.460]   We can do it.
[00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:26.460]   When is this running, by the way, because I have my--
[00:40:26.460 --> 00:40:27.460]   Sunday.
[00:40:27.460 --> 00:40:29.460]   Can you tell-- I can-- I can-- I can talk about it.
[00:40:29.460 --> 00:40:30.460]   I can talk about till Monday.
[00:40:30.460 --> 00:40:31.460]   Monday what time?
[00:40:31.460 --> 00:40:32.460]   Midnight.
[00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:33.460]   Midnight, yeah.
[00:40:33.460 --> 00:40:34.460]   All right.
[00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:36.940]   This will release at 12-on-one Monday morning.
[00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:44.500]   Intel's rolling out a demo of-- for their-- this week is the week that the Silicon Computer
[00:40:44.500 --> 00:40:49.660]   Conference, the big chip conference in San Francisco takes place, the IAS, CC, whatever,
[00:40:49.660 --> 00:40:54.220]   where everybody gets to show off their hot-- hot-- hot as things they've developed and
[00:40:54.220 --> 00:41:00.220]   Intel's got a demonstration chip that they've developed, which is a teraflop.
[00:41:00.220 --> 00:41:01.220]   Whoa.
[00:41:01.220 --> 00:41:05.500]   And it's-- and they have a whole bunch of new technologies that are involved with this
[00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:12.780]   thing that include 80 cores and a networking subsystem that lets the cores talk to each
[00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:13.780]   other.
[00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:14.780]   Interesting.
[00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:19.900]   But anyway, it comes out that it goes public on Sunday night at midnight.
[00:41:19.900 --> 00:41:22.620]   So it's OK for us to talk about it now.
[00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:26.500]   Yeah, as long as you don't run the story until Sunday night at midnight.
[00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:27.500]   12-on-one.
[00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:30.380]   And, you know, at 12-on-one or whatever.
[00:41:30.380 --> 00:41:35.180]   And yeah, and it's pretty-- they had a press conference today about it.
[00:41:35.180 --> 00:41:38.620]   And it's-- there's a lot of new technologies that they're trying to get to because what
[00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:43.300]   they determined, at least what they show on their slides, is that once you get to-- normally
[00:41:43.300 --> 00:41:48.540]   get to 16 cores, you have diminishing returns with any more cores than that.
[00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:51.340]   If you get to 32, you actually-- the performance goes down.
[00:41:51.340 --> 00:41:54.340]   And then because there's so much overhead for these things to talk to each other.
[00:41:54.340 --> 00:41:58.980]   So Intel's come up with basically essentially a router that lets these things talk to each
[00:41:58.980 --> 00:42:00.980]   other along with some other software.
[00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:03.780]   And they can now stack the things.
[00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:07.820]   So you have memory stacked on top of memory, stacked on top of processors in these-- in
[00:42:07.820 --> 00:42:10.500]   a very small package with almost no wattage.
[00:42:10.500 --> 00:42:12.940]   It's astonishingly low-powered.
[00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:13.940]   It's a very interesting breakthrough.
[00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:18.460]   And I think that's going to be the news next week from that ship show because Intel's
[00:42:18.460 --> 00:42:21.780]   gotten really into a massive publicity mode.
[00:42:21.780 --> 00:42:27.940]   John, I think this is a-- this is a red-letter day the first time you've ever revealed something
[00:42:27.940 --> 00:42:30.420]   in Twit, a scoop, if you will.
[00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:31.420]   So thank you.
[00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:32.420]   I appreciate it.
[00:42:32.420 --> 00:42:33.420]   You'll be on the blog, too, at the same time.
[00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:34.420]   Terraflops.
[00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:35.420]   That's amazing.
[00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:36.420]   Yeah, it's a Terraflop.
[00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:38.620]   They figured they got-- by the way, it's a Terraflop for 65 watts.
[00:42:38.620 --> 00:42:41.060]   Whoa, now see that's significant.
[00:42:41.060 --> 00:42:42.060]   That's huge.
[00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:46.580]   Now I'm interested because before, I didn't want to have to plug that in.
[00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:51.020]   Well, they apparently-- they said they had it-- they did a Terraflop machine once before
[00:42:51.020 --> 00:42:53.540]   in the like '95 or something like that.
[00:42:53.540 --> 00:42:55.900]   And it was 500 kilowatts.
[00:42:55.900 --> 00:42:59.180]   And it was a whole, like, half a football field full of machines.
[00:42:59.180 --> 00:43:01.420]   And that was a big parallel system.
[00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:04.540]   And there's a picture of it's called Code Red or something.
[00:43:04.540 --> 00:43:05.860]   I can't quite remember the name of it.
[00:43:05.860 --> 00:43:06.860]   But it's--
[00:43:06.860 --> 00:43:08.180]   But that's kind of what this is.
[00:43:08.180 --> 00:43:10.580]   It's kind of cluster-- giant cluster computing on a chip.
[00:43:10.580 --> 00:43:12.380]   Yes, it's up to the thumbnail size chip.
[00:43:12.380 --> 00:43:14.540]   You know, it says opposed to a room full of machines.
[00:43:14.540 --> 00:43:16.420]   And that was only in '95 or so.
[00:43:16.420 --> 00:43:18.540]   So it's not even that far off.
[00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:20.700]   Ray Kurzweil was right.
[00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:22.060]   About 10 years from now, you're going
[00:43:22.060 --> 00:43:26.460]   to be able to get a machine that's smarter than you are for $1,000.
[00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:29.580]   Well, it is pretty exciting to see this quantum computer demonstrated.
[00:43:29.580 --> 00:43:31.980]   I don't think I've seen anything with even pretending
[00:43:31.980 --> 00:43:35.540]   to be commercial applications before that was having quantum computing.
[00:43:35.540 --> 00:43:36.220]   Tom, go down.
[00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:37.100]   You've got to cover it.
[00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:40.100]   Well, there's been a lot of demonstrations of the ability
[00:43:40.100 --> 00:43:43.060]   to store data and run it in a lab situation.
[00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:45.380]   But I almost hesitate to believe these guys.
[00:43:45.380 --> 00:43:48.380]   I'm interested to see what their demonstration ends up being.
[00:43:48.380 --> 00:43:50.660]   Because if you could actually run some applications,
[00:43:50.660 --> 00:43:53.740]   and they only claim to have two that they can run, it's just a big step.
[00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:56.300]   It doesn't mean they're going to go to market anytime soon with anything.
[00:43:56.300 --> 00:43:57.860]   But this is a company.
[00:43:57.860 --> 00:44:00.980]   This is not a university research project.
[00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:05.580]   D-Wave is a company presumably wanting to make money on this thing.
[00:44:05.580 --> 00:44:06.540]   They're in British Columbia.
[00:44:06.540 --> 00:44:08.180]   They're in Burnby.
[00:44:08.180 --> 00:44:09.780]   Burnaby.
[00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:11.020]   So interesting.
[00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:14.620]   I'm very, very interested to see what happens.
[00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:16.220]   One more story.
[00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:19.940]   I don't know whether to applaud the EFF or laugh at them.
[00:44:19.940 --> 00:44:22.660]   They're apparently suing the Department of Defense demanding
[00:44:22.660 --> 00:44:27.940]   information on how the Army monitors soldier blogs.
[00:44:27.940 --> 00:44:31.100]   For some reason, they think soldiers' rights to free speech
[00:44:31.100 --> 00:44:34.220]   are being infringed.
[00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:37.460]   And don't you think the military should be monitoring blogs
[00:44:37.460 --> 00:44:40.140]   from active duty servicemen?
[00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:42.860]   Well, from what I understand of this, what they're suing for
[00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:48.100]   is for the military to release the guidelines under which they remove information.
[00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:50.820]   They don't actually want them to stop necessarily.
[00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:55.100]   They just want the public to know what kinds of things the military are removing.
[00:44:55.100 --> 00:45:00.340]   So are they removing legitimate security violations, confidential information?
[00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:02.820]   Or are they just censoring, saying we don't like those opinions
[00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:04.820]   and we don't want people to say it?
[00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:05.780]   I don't know.
[00:45:05.780 --> 00:45:09.540]   I mean, it's from World War II.
[00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:12.020]   Remember, they drop-- well, you don't remember, but I remember.
[00:45:12.020 --> 00:45:12.580]   Oh, I remember.
[00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:13.780]   They drop black lines.
[00:45:13.780 --> 00:45:14.700]   I mean, you remember.
[00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:16.380]   You were a black line in World War II.
[00:45:16.380 --> 00:45:17.580]   I've seen all those movies.
[00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:22.380]   Yeah, I saw them in the way in storming Normandy.
[00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:23.620]   They draw the lines through them.
[00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:26.420]   You were saying the other day, all that stuff Lincoln did during the Civil War.
[00:45:26.420 --> 00:45:28.060]   You were a young person.
[00:45:28.060 --> 00:45:28.780]   Good deal, younger person.
[00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:33.060]   Merlin, you're just stirring up stuff by sending out these FARC pictures in the middle of this.
[00:45:33.060 --> 00:45:34.260]   I just want to say--
[00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:35.260]   I just want to say--
[00:45:35.260 --> 00:45:38.300]   nobody is now thinking about the mill blogs.
[00:45:38.300 --> 00:45:39.460]   They're looking at me.
[00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:40.460]   What is this?
[00:45:40.460 --> 00:45:42.020]   Well, I like the East Dryler one.
[00:45:42.020 --> 00:45:44.460]   I like the famous Vamplog.
[00:45:44.460 --> 00:45:47.620]   It's the latest Photoshop contest on FARC.
[00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:49.780]   It's Photoshop Leo in the pool.
[00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:51.300]   There's a link to Leo.
[00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:54.660]   Leo on the set of call for help.
[00:45:54.660 --> 00:45:57.740]   He's on the set of call for help looking at his blackberry.
[00:45:57.740 --> 00:45:59.420]   Ironically, it is funny.
[00:45:59.420 --> 00:46:02.180]   I am, in fact.
[00:46:02.180 --> 00:46:04.020]   Which is your favorite?
[00:46:04.020 --> 00:46:08.420]   I like the one where I was saying, "Dear Penhouse, I never thought this would happen to me."
[00:46:08.420 --> 00:46:09.420]   This girl-- anyway.
[00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:15.180]   The best one actually is the Easter Island one in terms of award winning.
[00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:16.580]   Where's the Easter Island one?
[00:46:16.580 --> 00:46:18.860]   It's way down there.
[00:46:18.860 --> 00:46:24.180]   I like the idea of you in a pool full of swimming pool full of frolicking people.
[00:46:24.180 --> 00:46:26.900]   And you're there on the edge playing with a blackberry.
[00:46:26.900 --> 00:46:27.900]   Exactly.
[00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:30.900]   With a shirt on.
[00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:32.820]   George Jetson.
[00:46:32.820 --> 00:46:36.900]   It looks like-- is that what kind of marsupial is eating my head there?
[00:46:36.900 --> 00:46:37.900]   I don't know.
[00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:40.300]   I think that's stretching the contest a little far.
[00:46:40.300 --> 00:46:42.060]   Well, that will go dark.
[00:46:42.060 --> 00:46:45.740]   Instead of us dwelling on this, we should put a link on the website.
[00:46:45.740 --> 00:46:46.740]   We will.
[00:46:46.740 --> 00:46:47.740]   You'll be able to see it all.
[00:46:47.740 --> 00:46:49.220]   I'm still looking for-- oh, the Easter Island.
[00:46:49.220 --> 00:46:50.220]   That's good.
[00:46:50.220 --> 00:46:51.220]   I like it.
[00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:55.220]   I hit on a statue.
[00:46:55.220 --> 00:47:00.900]   Anyway, sorry, but I was a little distracted by Merlin's shenanigans.
[00:47:00.900 --> 00:47:02.460]   That was Will, sir.
[00:47:02.460 --> 00:47:03.460]   That was Will.
[00:47:03.460 --> 00:47:04.460]   Did that?
[00:47:04.460 --> 00:47:05.460]   Oh, yeah.
[00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:06.460]   I take no responsibility.
[00:47:06.460 --> 00:47:09.260]   See, Will's the kid in the class who looks good.
[00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:10.460]   He's got that British accent.
[00:47:10.460 --> 00:47:12.060]   He looks like he's paying attention.
[00:47:12.060 --> 00:47:14.660]   He's, in fact, getting Merlin in trouble.
[00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:19.900]   And Merlin's the kid in class who's making the jokes and the teacher gets mad at you,
[00:47:19.900 --> 00:47:20.900]   right?
[00:47:20.900 --> 00:47:22.140]   Dude, that is totally my MO.
[00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:23.140]   I know it is.
[00:47:23.140 --> 00:47:24.140]   I can tell.
[00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:25.500]   I can tell.
[00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:26.500]   And Merlin, that's you.
[00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:27.500]   Isn't it?
[00:47:27.500 --> 00:47:28.500]   That's your life story right there.
[00:47:28.500 --> 00:47:29.500]   It is.
[00:47:29.500 --> 00:47:30.500]   It is.
[00:47:30.500 --> 00:47:31.500]   English people loves banking.
[00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:33.820]   This is really well documented.
[00:47:33.820 --> 00:47:34.820]   It's known.
[00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:35.820]   It's a known fact.
[00:47:35.820 --> 00:47:37.820]   The whole culture is actually built around that.
[00:47:37.820 --> 00:47:39.220]   Many people don't know that.
[00:47:39.220 --> 00:47:40.620]   Gmail is now a public.
[00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:41.780]   It's no longer in beta.
[00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:43.860]   I think it's still in beta.
[00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:47.380]   Oh, it's still in beta, but now you don't have to be invited.
[00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:49.340]   You can get your own damn invitation.
[00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:53.020]   I guess they got enough server capacity now so they can do it.
[00:47:53.020 --> 00:47:54.060]   It's a-- yeah, right.
[00:47:54.060 --> 00:47:55.780]   They never had enough before.
[00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:59.380]   But, actually, that's an interesting thing that happened with Yahoo pipes.
[00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:01.660]   The first couple of days, you couldn't get on it.
[00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:02.660]   It was so popular.
[00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:06.300]   They underestimated the popularity of pipes.
[00:48:06.300 --> 00:48:10.220]   It's funny to talk to guys at these companies because they'll tell you that there's pretty
[00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:12.820]   much no way you can really prepare for what's going to happen.
[00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:13.820]   Like, gosh, you think Yahoo would--
[00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:15.620]   Once you put it out.
[00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:18.380]   There's all kinds of things that just-- when you're doing software, there's no way to know
[00:48:18.380 --> 00:48:19.380]   what's really going to happen.
[00:48:19.380 --> 00:48:20.660]   So you throw some users at it.
[00:48:20.660 --> 00:48:26.500]   And I know that happens, apparently, happens a lot at Google with people just being terrified
[00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:30.260]   that their product will ever appear on the homepage.
[00:48:30.260 --> 00:48:36.180]   Think Secret says, "Look for Leopard iLife07 and iWork07 by March."
[00:48:36.180 --> 00:48:40.020]   This really is more for Mac break weekly, but I'm sure to story some.
[00:48:40.020 --> 00:48:41.020]   What, Leopard by March?
[00:48:41.020 --> 00:48:42.540]   Yeah, I don't think that's right.
[00:48:42.540 --> 00:48:43.540]   Wow.
[00:48:43.540 --> 00:48:44.540]   It's ambitious.
[00:48:44.540 --> 00:48:48.940]   From what I've seen of Leopard, it's going to be June at the earliest.
[00:48:48.940 --> 00:48:50.780]   But maybe-- what else?
[00:48:50.780 --> 00:48:53.460]   Leo, I put some stuff in the fore-twit.
[00:48:53.460 --> 00:48:54.460]   Oh, right.
[00:48:54.460 --> 00:48:55.460]   Let me fix them.
[00:48:55.460 --> 00:49:01.780]   Check the fore-twit basket, see what our troublemaker has come up with.
[00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:04.140]   If there's FARC links in here, you're in deep trouble.
[00:49:04.140 --> 00:49:09.820]   No, we used to have Drew from FARC on the screensavers all the time.
[00:49:09.820 --> 00:49:10.820]   Oh, yeah.
[00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:12.740]   That site is now huge.
[00:49:12.740 --> 00:49:14.380]   He was just starting out back then.
[00:49:14.380 --> 00:49:15.380]   Yeah.
[00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:16.820]   I think we put him on the map.
[00:49:16.820 --> 00:49:17.820]   Maybe not.
[00:49:17.820 --> 00:49:18.820]   I don't know.
[00:49:18.820 --> 00:49:22.580]   All right, what do you pick one that you-- I'm looking at them, Will.
[00:49:22.580 --> 00:49:23.580]   What do you like?
[00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:31.780]   Well, I quite like from a slightly more geek out perspective, the NVIDIA Vista driver stuff.
[00:49:31.780 --> 00:49:35.060]   Because that's affecting a lot of people who have spent real money right now.
[00:49:35.060 --> 00:49:38.020]   I mean, there are not good drivers for NVIDIA cards.
[00:49:38.020 --> 00:49:40.460]   Oh, it's so much worse than that.
[00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:45.420]   It's not only are there not good drivers, but they're focusing on getting the drivers
[00:49:45.420 --> 00:49:50.100]   out for the stuff-- for the really high-end stuff, for the games that aren't even coming
[00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:51.820]   out to like March or April.
[00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:57.980]   So if you bought a high-end NVIDIA product like three or four months ago, maybe four months
[00:49:57.980 --> 00:50:03.180]   ago, you're not going to get an SLI driver or even a proper driver for gaming in Vista
[00:50:03.180 --> 00:50:06.140]   until like April, May, the earliest.
[00:50:06.140 --> 00:50:07.140]   Oh.
[00:50:07.140 --> 00:50:11.660]   And I mean, if you've just spent 400, 300 quid, you know, hundreds of dollars on one of these
[00:50:11.660 --> 00:50:14.780]   cards, you've got to be pretty sick right now.
[00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:15.780]   And it's not like--
[00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:16.780]   Does it work in Vista or just doesn't--
[00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:18.780]   It just doesn't work well in Vista.
[00:50:18.780 --> 00:50:19.780]   It still works, sir.
[00:50:19.780 --> 00:50:20.780]   It works.
[00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:25.980]   It works if you wanted to work like a $100 graphics card rather than a $400 graphics card.
[00:50:25.980 --> 00:50:29.700]   I've got a laptop that's doing that because it doesn't have a proper driver in Vista.
[00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:34.740]   So when it runs, it runs like, you know, generic graphics card, which means Media Center
[00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:35.740]   doesn't work.
[00:50:35.740 --> 00:50:36.740]   Yeah, not in the era.
[00:50:36.740 --> 00:50:40.020]   Videos don't stream like, right, I can't output it to an HDTV anymore.
[00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:41.340]   And the problem is that--
[00:50:41.340 --> 00:50:42.340]   Is it the DRM?
[00:50:42.340 --> 00:50:43.540]   Is that what's causing these?
[00:50:43.540 --> 00:50:45.700]   No, it's with the NVIDIA ones.
[00:50:45.700 --> 00:50:50.900]   Their previous top end card was like a match of two cards on one board, which used SLI.
[00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:52.580]   It was like, SLI on a single card.
[00:50:52.580 --> 00:50:58.020]   But they haven't managed to get SLI working properly in Vista so that high end card basically
[00:50:58.020 --> 00:50:59.020]   doesn't work.
[00:50:59.020 --> 00:51:01.980]   Well, this is going to happen with a new operating system, right?
[00:51:01.980 --> 00:51:04.700]   Sure, that's why you shouldn't get it.
[00:51:04.700 --> 00:51:06.180]   You should all off.
[00:51:06.180 --> 00:51:08.180]   I like Vista a lot better than that.
[00:51:08.180 --> 00:51:13.740]   You can't even get the hybrid hard desks for another six months.
[00:51:13.740 --> 00:51:19.660]   But now, see, I'm trying to remember back to XP and back farther.
[00:51:19.660 --> 00:51:20.820]   And this is pretty normal, right?
[00:51:20.820 --> 00:51:23.100]   It takes a little while for everything to catch them.
[00:51:23.100 --> 00:51:25.580]   You always jump on board before everybody else anyway.
[00:51:25.580 --> 00:51:26.580]   Nothing works.
[00:51:26.580 --> 00:51:30.380]   It looks like the speech recognition is working in Vista.
[00:51:30.380 --> 00:51:31.980]   Actually, that works pretty nicely, yeah.
[00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:33.820]   Did you see the flaw?
[00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:34.820]   What's that?
[00:51:34.820 --> 00:51:35.820]   Have you seen the flaw?
[00:51:35.820 --> 00:51:36.820]   What's the flaw?
[00:51:36.820 --> 00:51:37.820]   What happens?
[00:51:37.820 --> 00:51:38.820]   You can send somebody an audio file.
[00:51:38.820 --> 00:51:39.820]   Oh, yeah.
[00:51:39.820 --> 00:51:40.820]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:41.820]   What happened?
[00:51:41.820 --> 00:51:44.220]   Well, yeah, actually, you probably know more about it than I do.
[00:51:44.220 --> 00:51:47.100]   But just reading a couple of stories here that apparently you can send an audio file
[00:51:47.100 --> 00:51:50.020]   that will allow you to execute commands over a speech recognition.
[00:51:50.020 --> 00:51:51.020]   Oh, great.
[00:51:51.020 --> 00:51:56.540]   If somebody has their speech recognition on and the mic is active and near the speakers,
[00:51:56.540 --> 00:51:59.420]   you can totally take over the machine.
[00:51:59.420 --> 00:52:00.420]   There's a fix, Leo.
[00:52:00.420 --> 00:52:01.940]   You turn off your speakers.
[00:52:01.940 --> 00:52:03.980]   Turn off your speakers or turn off your mic.
[00:52:03.980 --> 00:52:05.940]   Closed, bug closed.
[00:52:05.940 --> 00:52:06.940]   Speakers closed.
[00:52:06.940 --> 00:52:07.940]   That bug is going to close.
[00:52:07.940 --> 00:52:08.940]   That bug is going to close.
[00:52:08.940 --> 00:52:09.940]   You end up in an office.
[00:52:09.940 --> 00:52:13.340]   All these things, could you yell real loud?
[00:52:13.340 --> 00:52:16.860]   Erase C, star die, you know, right, right.
[00:52:16.860 --> 00:52:24.100]   Somebody was suggesting going to the white phone in the airport and paging reset.
[00:52:24.100 --> 00:52:26.060]   Reset.
[00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:27.420]   We'll reset.
[00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:31.700]   Paging RM star, RM star, RM star.
[00:52:31.700 --> 00:52:32.700]   That's funny.
[00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:33.940]   But what command really could you issue?
[00:52:33.940 --> 00:52:36.940]   You know, open browser, go to devorect.org/blog.
[00:52:36.940 --> 00:52:39.140]   Well, that's not a bad idea.
[00:52:39.140 --> 00:52:41.940]   You may take a full matte C, a total by-side.
[00:52:41.940 --> 00:52:42.940]   Exactly.
[00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:44.620]   But then it gives you all these.
[00:52:44.620 --> 00:52:46.060]   Could you just, now that's a question.
[00:52:46.060 --> 00:52:47.860]   Does the voice recognition allow you to say yes?
[00:52:47.860 --> 00:52:48.860]   Okay, okay.
[00:52:48.860 --> 00:52:49.860]   Oh, yeah.
[00:52:49.860 --> 00:52:50.860]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:52:50.860 --> 00:52:51.860]   So you'd have to say a few okay's.
[00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:54.260]   And the irony is it has apparently gotten a lot better, right?
[00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:55.260]   Right.
[00:52:55.260 --> 00:52:56.260]   Your work.
[00:52:56.260 --> 00:52:57.260]   Quality distribution.
[00:52:57.260 --> 00:52:58.260]   Oh, man.
[00:52:58.260 --> 00:52:59.260]   They can't buy a break.
[00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:00.860]   Is any of the group you're actually using that?
[00:53:00.860 --> 00:53:02.500]   Or are you just the speech recognition?
[00:53:02.500 --> 00:53:03.500]   I played around with it.
[00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:07.620]   If I had RSI, you know, I had bad risks, I could probably get buy with it.
[00:53:07.620 --> 00:53:10.780]   It wasn't perfect, but you could actually recognize you.
[00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:17.900]   And if you had a good mic and a set of headphones for security reasons, then you could probably
[00:53:17.900 --> 00:53:19.140]   make do with it.
[00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:20.140]   It did work.
[00:53:20.140 --> 00:53:21.820]   I did a video on it.
[00:53:21.820 --> 00:53:25.820]   And I was able to make it open the calculator, close the calculator, write some stuff that
[00:53:25.820 --> 00:53:27.060]   I said down.
[00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:28.780]   Oh, so you controlled the rotation with it?
[00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:29.780]   Oh, yeah.
[00:53:29.780 --> 00:53:35.580]   Who was it that was on our web team who had RSI would use the Dragon to dictate?
[00:53:35.580 --> 00:53:37.580]   Lewis Wallace, he was the home page editor.
[00:53:37.580 --> 00:53:38.580]   Yeah, and there was a woman.
[00:53:38.580 --> 00:53:39.980]   I can't remember her name, Darnit.
[00:53:39.980 --> 00:53:40.980]   And I'm embarrassed.
[00:53:40.980 --> 00:53:45.780]   You know, that thing, these things are sketchy because I, for example, have had nothing but
[00:53:45.780 --> 00:53:46.780]   trouble.
[00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:50.940]   I've looked at these things since the earliest ones because, you know, if your voice isn't
[00:53:50.940 --> 00:53:57.180]   it, if you don't have the right tones in your voice, and I have like a voice that lacks
[00:53:57.180 --> 00:54:00.540]   a lot of lower mid-range.
[00:54:00.540 --> 00:54:02.820]   And I mean, I have to tell you that, John.
[00:54:02.820 --> 00:54:09.220]   I have notes below it and above it, but there's a huge missing area.
[00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:13.820]   And these things are looking for mostly like kind of screechy mid-range type voices.
[00:54:13.820 --> 00:54:15.780]   Try out this to speech recognition.
[00:54:15.780 --> 00:54:18.140]   It'd be interesting to see if you have the same problem with it.
[00:54:18.140 --> 00:54:19.980]   There's also the issue in an office environment.
[00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:25.340]   This woman who was using it to do her articles for the Tech TV website, somebody I can't
[00:54:25.340 --> 00:54:28.740]   remember who some wag snuck up behind her with one of those paddleball things and went
[00:54:28.740 --> 00:54:29.740]   "Pup, pup, pup, pup, pup!"
[00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:31.740]   And I kept putting periods in her.
[00:54:31.740 --> 00:54:37.340]   It sounds like a good story.
[00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:38.340]   I saw it happen.
[00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:39.340]   I know it's here.
[00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:46.180]   So Arthur Oakes-Saltzberger, chairman, owner and publisher of the New York Times, was
[00:54:46.180 --> 00:54:50.420]   at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland.
[00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:51.420]   You should have done Twit from there.
[00:54:51.420 --> 00:54:52.900]   Wouldn't that have been great?
[00:54:52.900 --> 00:54:53.900]   We'll go next year.
[00:54:53.900 --> 00:54:55.300]   It wouldn't be great.
[00:54:55.300 --> 00:54:56.860]   It's a long way to drive.
[00:54:56.860 --> 00:54:58.860]   You don't think you can drive there.
[00:54:58.860 --> 00:54:59.860]   It's cold.
[00:54:59.860 --> 00:55:05.760]   So he says, "I don't know whether we'll be printing the Times in five years."
[00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:07.340]   He says, "You know what?
[00:55:07.340 --> 00:55:09.980]   I don't care either," he says.
[00:55:09.980 --> 00:55:12.540]   The internet is a wonderful place to be.
[00:55:12.540 --> 00:55:13.860]   How old is this guy?
[00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:15.820]   This guy's not as old as you think.
[00:55:15.820 --> 00:55:18.500]   I don't know what he's thinking.
[00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:20.580]   Yeah, the internet's a great place.
[00:55:20.580 --> 00:55:25.220]   But if you got a newspaper that's so dominant like that, it's not like they're... he's
[00:55:25.220 --> 00:55:29.580]   equating his online viewership to his print viewership.
[00:55:29.580 --> 00:55:30.580]   Yeah, listen.
[00:55:30.580 --> 00:55:35.900]   He says he has one and a half million people a day reading the online site compared to
[00:55:35.900 --> 00:55:38.260]   1.1 million reading the print edition.
[00:55:38.260 --> 00:55:43.020]   Yeah, but the print edition is like 100 page views or actually if you looked at each article
[00:55:43.020 --> 00:55:48.940]   individually, maybe a thousand or 2,000 page views if you wanted to equate it to the internet.
[00:55:48.940 --> 00:55:53.740]   And when you go on the internet, the average user hits maybe four or five on the outs like
[00:55:53.740 --> 00:55:56.020]   Yahoo, they hit maybe eight pages.
[00:55:56.020 --> 00:55:57.020]   That's like...
[00:55:57.020 --> 00:56:03.500]   I mean, there's a minuscule total compared to what you get in terms of pure content delivery
[00:56:03.500 --> 00:56:06.060]   on a big newspaper like that.
[00:56:06.060 --> 00:56:08.460]   The guy's physically insane.
[00:56:08.460 --> 00:56:11.100]   He doesn't like spending the money on the news print.
[00:56:11.100 --> 00:56:12.260]   I'm sure I know what it is.
[00:56:12.260 --> 00:56:13.260]   But it's ludicrous.
[00:56:13.260 --> 00:56:14.260]   I mean, there's no comparison.
[00:56:14.260 --> 00:56:15.260]   I mean, you can't...
[00:56:15.260 --> 00:56:16.780]   The numbers aren't even the same.
[00:56:16.780 --> 00:56:17.780]   It's just...
[00:56:17.780 --> 00:56:19.260]   Yeah, sure, you got a million, you know?
[00:56:19.260 --> 00:56:20.260]   So what?
[00:56:20.260 --> 00:56:22.820]   I mean, PC Magazine, we get like a million a day.
[00:56:22.820 --> 00:56:26.260]   It's not the same as the New York Times, and we don't have the same kind of income.
[00:56:26.260 --> 00:56:27.260]   Right.
[00:56:27.260 --> 00:56:30.460]   Maybe he's an investor in E-ink.
[00:56:30.460 --> 00:56:35.060]   He says, "If you want to read the New York Times online, you will have to pay."
[00:56:35.060 --> 00:56:36.060]   So maybe that's his...
[00:56:36.060 --> 00:56:38.460]   The worst of both worlds.
[00:56:38.460 --> 00:56:40.060]   Yeah, he's got a ruin.
[00:56:40.060 --> 00:56:42.060]   He's got quite a business model going there.
[00:56:42.060 --> 00:56:43.060]   Yeah, I'll ruin it.
[00:56:43.060 --> 00:56:47.620]   I'll give up my newspaper when I have ubiquitous internet and a device that doesn't require
[00:56:47.620 --> 00:56:49.460]   a backlight to read.
[00:56:49.460 --> 00:56:50.460]   Yeah, good point.
[00:56:50.460 --> 00:56:54.140]   And I could just download it immediately and have pretty much the same experience.
[00:56:54.140 --> 00:56:56.860]   Holding something in my hand, I could just read by natural life.
[00:56:56.860 --> 00:57:00.940]   Yeah, if that five-year plan includes ubiquitous wireless and the ability to have some kind
[00:57:00.940 --> 00:57:04.980]   of subscription based on something like, say, pipes to bring it back around.
[00:57:04.980 --> 00:57:05.980]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:57:05.980 --> 00:57:06.980]   That's a different thing.
[00:57:06.980 --> 00:57:09.020]   And if it's a reader that you can take on for me, like take on couch-
[00:57:09.020 --> 00:57:11.060]   You know, even so, it's a different medium.
[00:57:11.060 --> 00:57:12.060]   I mean, this is like...
[00:57:12.060 --> 00:57:16.180]   Yeah, but don't you think the print medium is in trouble and dying?
[00:57:16.180 --> 00:57:18.940]   That's what he's saying?
[00:57:18.940 --> 00:57:21.820]   That's what he's saying, but I think this is...
[00:57:21.820 --> 00:57:24.380]   He doesn't believe he has a choice, it sounds like.
[00:57:24.380 --> 00:57:27.420]   Yeah, well, he's obviously lost it.
[00:57:27.420 --> 00:57:28.420]   But it couldn't make sense.
[00:57:28.420 --> 00:57:30.420]   So they get a larger registration base.
[00:57:30.420 --> 00:57:32.540]   Let's say they charge a little bit less than they're charging right now.
[00:57:32.540 --> 00:57:34.180]   They get a lot more people signed up.
[00:57:34.180 --> 00:57:37.380]   They're going to be able to use all that demographic information to push out much more targeted
[00:57:37.380 --> 00:57:38.940]   ads, get a higher CPM.
[00:57:38.940 --> 00:57:42.780]   Oh, the great dream of the crazy advertising world.
[00:57:42.780 --> 00:57:45.020]   Well, the numbers and the errors going out.
[00:57:45.020 --> 00:57:46.540]   People don't like being targeted to that extreme.
[00:57:46.540 --> 00:57:49.700]   I mean, there's going to be a backlash against this sort of thing.
[00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:53.660]   I don't like people's, "Hey, John, hey," or something we think you'd be interested in.
[00:57:53.660 --> 00:57:56.660]   90% of the time they're wrong anyway.
[00:57:56.660 --> 00:57:57.660]   I don't know.
[00:57:57.660 --> 00:57:59.420]   I think research shows.
[00:57:59.420 --> 00:58:03.340]   People will tolerate ads if it's something they're interested in buying or want to know
[00:58:03.340 --> 00:58:06.540]   more about much better than they'll tolerate ranking the ads.
[00:58:06.540 --> 00:58:08.340]   More importantly, people will pay a lot.
[00:58:08.340 --> 00:58:11.260]   There's a reason there's ads for golf stuff on an airplane.
[00:58:11.260 --> 00:58:14.340]   And that's the kind of audience that they know they can reach.
[00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:15.340]   I don't know.
[00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:19.380]   I just think that as that stuff gets a little smarter, that there's going to be a good deal
[00:58:19.380 --> 00:58:20.380]   more money there.
[00:58:20.380 --> 00:58:22.300]   But what's the most fun is reading the Sunday paper.
[00:58:22.300 --> 00:58:26.340]   You know, the thing is that, yeah, this all sounds good on paper, but I think Tom would
[00:58:26.340 --> 00:58:33.180]   test at this because CNET has been in the forefront of advertising online from the beginning.
[00:58:33.180 --> 00:58:34.980]   And they have to keep up in the ante.
[00:58:34.980 --> 00:58:38.020]   They got to go to the big ad in the middle and then they have to do this.
[00:58:38.020 --> 00:58:42.140]   I mean, people will get, yeah, maybe those targeted ads look good on paper for now.
[00:58:42.140 --> 00:58:44.940]   And then after a while, people get used to them and then they stop seeing them.
[00:58:44.940 --> 00:58:47.060]   And so the next thing comes along.
[00:58:47.060 --> 00:58:48.060]   And then there's something else.
[00:58:48.060 --> 00:58:51.780]   And then there's something else because you have to keep it's almost like an addiction
[00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:53.860]   and you have to keep up in the dose.
[00:58:53.860 --> 00:58:55.980]   And then people say, hey, this sucks.
[00:58:55.980 --> 00:58:57.340]   These ads, there's too many of them.
[00:58:57.340 --> 00:58:59.140]   I'd rather have something with no ads.
[00:58:59.140 --> 00:59:03.940]   So if you were a salt-sperger, would you be going with a pay model or with a more ad-centric
[00:59:03.940 --> 00:59:04.940]   model?
[00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:05.940]   You'd go with a pay model?
[00:59:05.940 --> 00:59:06.940]   I'd never go with a pay model.
[00:59:06.940 --> 00:59:07.940]   I mean, the Wall Street Journal--
[00:59:07.940 --> 00:59:11.860]   Well, they're going to pay their employees with Confederate script and hard candies or
[00:59:11.860 --> 00:59:16.100]   how would they, in terms of getting into more of an e-based or, you know, an online
[00:59:16.100 --> 00:59:17.100]   format.
[00:59:17.100 --> 00:59:18.100]   I wouldn't.
[00:59:18.100 --> 00:59:19.940]   I think the entire strategy is crazy.
[00:59:19.940 --> 00:59:22.140]   I mean, I don't know what he's thinking.
[00:59:22.140 --> 00:59:23.540]   I baffles me.
[00:59:23.540 --> 00:59:29.860]   I mean, they've done a wonderful job of getting the print version of the newspaper delivered
[00:59:29.860 --> 00:59:31.860]   in Albany, California, for God's sake.
[00:59:31.860 --> 00:59:33.940]   I mean, in every segment, anything like that before.
[00:59:33.940 --> 00:59:37.940]   I mean, it's unbelievable that he's even thinking of backtracking.
[00:59:37.940 --> 00:59:43.220]   I think the key would be to create LED-based electronic devices that they could float down
[00:59:43.220 --> 00:59:44.220]   the Charles River.
[00:59:44.220 --> 00:59:47.740]   I think that's going to change the business model in town.
[00:59:47.740 --> 00:59:48.740]   Tell me.
[00:59:48.740 --> 00:59:52.660]   Or some way to push out the content that you want that's relevant to you.
[00:59:52.660 --> 00:59:53.660]   If it could be pushed.
[00:59:53.660 --> 00:59:54.660]   Wow.
[00:59:54.660 --> 00:59:59.180]   But sure, the whole point of a newspaper is that, like, you glance over the stuff that
[00:59:59.180 --> 01:00:02.100]   isn't relevant to you in the fact you might find of interest.
[01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:06.460]   I worry that in the sort of, you know, an age of targeted everything, like, you know,
[01:00:06.460 --> 01:00:10.380]   you might only want these kind of news stories and you lose all your context of the world.
[01:00:10.380 --> 01:00:14.780]   And in the end, all you end up reading about is, like, the same thing over and over and over.
[01:00:14.780 --> 01:00:16.460]   No, I'm in a total agreement with that.
[01:00:16.460 --> 01:00:21.220]   The newspapers is, like, lots of discovery, things you didn't know you wanted to read
[01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:24.780]   about kind of interesting things from, you know, different perspectives.
[01:00:24.780 --> 01:00:26.580]   You guys are sounding like old farts now.
[01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:27.900]   That still happens on the web.
[01:00:27.900 --> 01:00:33.020]   I mean, how many people use the default settings on a Maya who or a My Google page?
[01:00:33.020 --> 01:00:37.220]   Because, you know, or they pull in stuff that's recommended or, you know, people still do
[01:00:37.220 --> 01:00:38.460]   that even on the web.
[01:00:38.460 --> 01:00:41.860]   But I think the only thing that's going to replace the newspaper though is something
[01:00:41.860 --> 01:00:45.540]   that works like the newspaper and it'll just be the electronic version of it.
[01:00:45.540 --> 01:00:49.740]   And also, there is still a lot of discoverability because I subscribe to a lot of RSS feeds
[01:00:49.740 --> 01:00:52.900]   and I'll follow stuff and I'll follow other people's links to things.
[01:00:52.900 --> 01:00:55.700]   So, I mean, you know, maybe I'm not going to learn something in a language I don't
[01:00:55.700 --> 01:00:59.420]   speak or something, but I do find there is still a lot of discoverability out there.
[01:00:59.420 --> 01:01:03.020]   I think it's a little bit of a strong man to say that goes away completely.
[01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:04.260]   But I think it's generational.
[01:01:04.260 --> 01:01:10.740]   I mean, I think my kids are never going to use print, you know, I mean, they're going
[01:01:10.740 --> 01:01:12.180]   to they're going to solve, they live on screen.
[01:01:12.180 --> 01:01:13.660]   They don't even use an email anymore.
[01:01:13.660 --> 01:01:15.900]   People are treating their mice base pages like email now.
[01:01:15.900 --> 01:01:18.220]   I mean, it's this is all evolving so fast.
[01:01:18.220 --> 01:01:19.220]   Yeah.
[01:01:19.220 --> 01:01:23.060]   You know, a lot of the reasons these newspapers are having trouble, they mean they moan and
[01:01:23.060 --> 01:01:25.260]   grow and about this and that.
[01:01:25.260 --> 01:01:29.340]   One thing, they never paid much attention to the fact that you have a Craigslist in the
[01:01:29.340 --> 01:01:31.060]   world that's going to give away classifieds.
[01:01:31.060 --> 01:01:35.300]   So they never adjusted to that and they knew 20 years ago this was going to happen.
[01:01:35.300 --> 01:01:37.780]   And then the other thing is their product stinks.
[01:01:37.780 --> 01:01:41.300]   Has anybody looked at some of these newspapers and compared them to some of the newspapers
[01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:42.980]   of like 50 years ago?
[01:01:42.980 --> 01:01:43.980]   Oh, yeah.
[01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:45.780]   They're just it's just ridiculously crappy.
[01:01:45.780 --> 01:01:47.140]   Papers are so costly.
[01:01:47.140 --> 01:01:49.420]   Yeah, they can't pay the reporters anymore.
[01:01:49.420 --> 01:01:50.420]   The good ones.
[01:01:50.420 --> 01:01:51.420]   Very costly.
[01:01:51.420 --> 01:01:53.620]   Well, maybe if they let's use the Wall Street Journal, I like the Wall Street Journal.
[01:01:53.620 --> 01:01:54.620]   The print edition is great.
[01:01:54.620 --> 01:01:58.540]   I subscribe to both the print in the online edition and I use both frequently.
[01:01:58.540 --> 01:02:00.300]   It's a pretty dense.
[01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:02.060]   It's a good example of a fairly dense.
[01:02:02.060 --> 01:02:03.060]   It's a good paper.
[01:02:03.060 --> 01:02:04.060]   Okay.
[01:02:04.060 --> 01:02:07.220]   They've also look through their tar and getting a little lightweight with these features,
[01:02:07.220 --> 01:02:09.780]   which I think is what's killing newspapers to begin with.
[01:02:09.780 --> 01:02:11.580]   A new space was supposed to be about news.
[01:02:11.580 --> 01:02:17.300]   That's supposed to be about features, these long winded features about hem lines or something
[01:02:17.300 --> 01:02:19.340]   that's got nothing to do with anything or.
[01:02:19.340 --> 01:02:22.420]   This is all steamer arrivals and criminal reports.
[01:02:22.420 --> 01:02:23.420]   What about news week?
[01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:24.420]   This week.
[01:02:24.420 --> 01:02:25.420]   News week had a cover.
[01:02:25.420 --> 01:02:27.380]   The cover on News Week is Paris Hilton Britain.
[01:02:27.380 --> 01:02:31.100]   It's the last time he even saw a steamer arrival mention.
[01:02:31.100 --> 01:02:33.300]   I mean, we were even more steamer.
[01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:36.900]   I'm going back a little farther, I guess.
[01:02:36.900 --> 01:02:37.900]   Why not?
[01:02:37.900 --> 01:02:39.060]   I think it'd be cool to see.
[01:02:39.060 --> 01:02:41.580]   I mean, I didn't know the Queen Mary was coming into town.
[01:02:41.580 --> 01:02:42.580]   It wasn't in the paper.
[01:02:42.580 --> 01:02:43.580]   I read in the paper.
[01:02:43.580 --> 01:02:44.580]   That's how I found out.
[01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:45.740]   I saw it on the SF Gates site.
[01:02:45.740 --> 01:02:47.500]   Yeah, no, it was all over the place.
[01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:48.500]   All right.
[01:02:48.500 --> 01:02:49.980]   That's a steamer coming into town.
[01:02:49.980 --> 01:02:52.900]   Here's a good example of a mediocre.
[01:02:52.900 --> 01:02:54.460]   Here's the SF gate.
[01:02:54.460 --> 01:02:57.340]   I was looking at this the other day because I know the guys at SF.
[01:02:57.340 --> 01:03:00.340]   The guys at SF are trying to fix their product a little bit.
[01:03:00.340 --> 01:03:02.180]   I'm looking at the front page of this thing.
[01:03:02.180 --> 01:03:09.900]   There's this big, the picture that they show, the photograph is a big picture, like a milk
[01:03:09.900 --> 01:03:14.580]   picture that's filled with, about halfway up with honey or maple syrup or something.
[01:03:14.580 --> 01:03:19.780]   It's shot in one of these little cubes that photographers use to shoot food pictures.
[01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:22.620]   That's the picture that's supposed to be a grab your interest.
[01:03:22.620 --> 01:03:25.420]   It's a big jar of everything's coming up syrup.
[01:03:25.420 --> 01:03:26.820]   I mean, what is this?
[01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:28.140]   I mean, look at this thing.
[01:03:28.140 --> 01:03:29.140]   How boring can these people?
[01:03:29.140 --> 01:03:30.740]   Could you be any more boring?
[01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:33.620]   I mean, I can't imagine.
[01:03:33.620 --> 01:03:39.380]   Gate is the website of the San Francisco Chronicle, which is the primary newspaper in San Francisco.
[01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:40.380]   Just for those people who...
[01:03:40.380 --> 01:03:43.660]   Well, you know, if you're going to bore the public to death with the product and you wonder
[01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:47.860]   why your search goes down, hey, look within.
[01:03:47.860 --> 01:03:50.380]   Look within my soul.
[01:03:50.380 --> 01:03:51.380]   Grasshopper.
[01:03:51.380 --> 01:03:52.380]   Here, inner syrup.
[01:03:52.380 --> 01:03:56.540]   That was a little...I was a little miffed at Newsweek for putting Britney Spears and Paris
[01:03:56.540 --> 01:03:59.580]   Hilton on the cover and saying, "Girl's gone wild."
[01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:01.820]   That didn't seem like a hot news.
[01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:05.540]   You know, and this is a little bit of my first rattle.
[01:04:05.540 --> 01:04:10.020]   But I've watched this happen with CNN in particular, the CNN site, where increasingly
[01:04:10.020 --> 01:04:12.700]   that little kind of bullet at side, they've got...
[01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:14.340]   It's just getting more and more asinine.
[01:04:14.340 --> 01:04:15.340]   And you remember after 9/11...
[01:04:15.340 --> 01:04:16.340]   So people...
[01:04:16.340 --> 01:04:18.020]   Hey, everything's no more celebrity worship.
[01:04:18.020 --> 01:04:20.740]   It's all going to be about hard news.
[01:04:20.740 --> 01:04:21.740]   And it's always...
[01:04:21.740 --> 01:04:22.740]   Like always like...
[01:04:22.740 --> 01:04:23.740]   People love that stuff.
[01:04:23.740 --> 01:04:24.740]   You know?
[01:04:24.740 --> 01:04:25.740]   Yeah, that's what they want.
[01:04:25.740 --> 01:04:26.740]   Anna Nicole Smith.
[01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:28.700]   But you know what?
[01:04:28.700 --> 01:04:32.500]   This goes straight to the point I was making badly though, which is that it's really hard
[01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:35.420]   to please everybody, especially with a print edition.
[01:04:35.420 --> 01:04:39.020]   And in this case, they're trying to split their attention in all these different ways.
[01:04:39.020 --> 01:04:42.740]   Like good old salon, they end up doing a whole bunch of wire stuff.
[01:04:42.740 --> 01:04:46.620]   I mean, God, how much wire stuff do you see now on things like on SFG?
[01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:49.180]   And I think it comes down to it's very, very costly to do.
[01:04:49.180 --> 01:04:50.180]   A lot of bureaus of clothes.
[01:04:50.180 --> 01:04:51.180]   That's what John was saying.
[01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:53.180]   They can't afford their reporters in here.
[01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:56.660]   Well, they can't afford the reporters, but they can sure afford to pay the executives
[01:04:56.660 --> 01:05:00.380]   big bonuses, but you can't afford the reporters.
[01:05:00.380 --> 01:05:04.340]   So in some, you know, in other words, there's some guy that doesn't really do much.
[01:05:04.340 --> 01:05:07.820]   A vice president gets half a million a year, but you can't afford the reporters.
[01:05:07.820 --> 01:05:11.660]   I mean, this just can't afford the reporters thing is out of control.
[01:05:11.660 --> 01:05:13.420]   The other thing is where...
[01:05:13.420 --> 01:05:16.020]   How much does it cost to be running wire service stuff all the time?
[01:05:16.020 --> 01:05:17.020]   They don't...
[01:05:17.020 --> 01:05:18.020]   Can't afford the reporters.
[01:05:18.020 --> 01:05:19.020]   They don't even bother.
[01:05:19.020 --> 01:05:23.380]   They want a bunch of AP stories or these little papers around here run New York Times stories
[01:05:23.380 --> 01:05:24.980]   from the syndicate.
[01:05:24.980 --> 01:05:27.660]   I mean, it's just they do everything on the cheap.
[01:05:27.660 --> 01:05:28.860]   They don't pay for anything.
[01:05:28.860 --> 01:05:29.860]   And then they want...
[01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:34.300]   They produce a crappy product that anyone can produce who subscribes to the AP feed or
[01:05:34.300 --> 01:05:35.580]   UPI.
[01:05:35.580 --> 01:05:38.740]   And then they have a crappy product and people start to say, "Oh, I don't want to
[01:05:38.740 --> 01:05:39.740]   resubscribe."
[01:05:39.740 --> 01:05:41.860]   I've had people, they offer free subscriptions.
[01:05:41.860 --> 01:05:44.020]   You can get it from a month or a year.
[01:05:44.020 --> 01:05:45.740]   And I say, "No, I don't want it."
[01:05:45.740 --> 01:05:47.660]   You know, I just assume go online and get my news.
[01:05:47.660 --> 01:05:49.340]   You guys, the paper stinks.
[01:05:49.340 --> 01:05:50.340]   Well, now you're...
[01:05:50.340 --> 01:05:51.340]   Now you're just...
[01:05:51.340 --> 01:05:52.340]   Am I making myself clear?
[01:05:52.340 --> 01:05:53.500]   Yeah, you're proving our point online.
[01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:55.500]   You just said you went online for sure.
[01:05:55.500 --> 01:05:56.500]   Yeah, I went online because...
[01:05:56.500 --> 01:05:58.980]   You said you agree with Arthur Salzberger.
[01:05:58.980 --> 01:06:02.540]   No, but it's not for the same reasons.
[01:06:02.540 --> 01:06:07.580]   I mean, I'm only in agreement because if the product was good, I would have a newspaper
[01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:08.580]   come into the house.
[01:06:08.580 --> 01:06:10.740]   So they can go online and produce a crappy product and everybody...
[01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:11.740]   Well, you know what?
[01:06:11.740 --> 01:06:12.740]   I don't read the local...
[01:06:12.740 --> 01:06:17.140]   I mean, my wife reads SFGate a lot and once in a while she finds some good stories.
[01:06:17.140 --> 01:06:20.180]   But generally speaking, I go to international life.
[01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:21.180]   I use...
[01:06:21.180 --> 01:06:24.380]   I use S feeds and I just scan a bunch of feeds.
[01:06:24.380 --> 01:06:25.380]   I don't even go to Google News.
[01:06:25.380 --> 01:06:26.380]   I don't even go to Google News.
[01:06:26.380 --> 01:06:27.380]   Yeah, or go to Google News.
[01:06:27.380 --> 01:06:28.380]   You don't go to sites anymore.
[01:06:28.380 --> 01:06:30.380]   You don't go to individual sites anymore.
[01:06:30.380 --> 01:06:33.580]   The one thing that I think is just super quicky, but I think the thing that's really
[01:06:33.580 --> 01:06:39.460]   killing discoverability and I'm getting this first hand is all of the top N sites.
[01:06:39.460 --> 01:06:40.460]   You know what I mean?
[01:06:40.460 --> 01:06:41.460]   You end up...
[01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:44.580]   Well, so like even something like Dig, which is a site that I enjoy, or something like Yahoo
[01:06:44.580 --> 01:06:45.580]   Most Popular.
[01:06:45.580 --> 01:06:46.580]   And you end up just seeing...
[01:06:46.580 --> 01:06:49.940]   I think that's the part that kills discoverability is when you're constantly just getting the
[01:06:49.940 --> 01:06:52.540]   hive, only the hive mind idea of what's out there.
[01:06:52.540 --> 01:06:53.540]   But I mean, that's right.
[01:06:53.540 --> 01:06:54.540]   A site like Pretty Arts and Letters.
[01:06:54.540 --> 01:06:55.540]   That's pretty good.
[01:06:55.540 --> 01:06:57.140]   I mean, you're getting exposed to a lot of stuff from Dig.
[01:06:57.140 --> 01:06:58.140]   Well, you know, it's...
[01:06:58.140 --> 01:06:59.940]   It's always the same 10 stories.
[01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:03.460]   Yeah, but that's why it's to me to find out that it's great to find a few sites that
[01:07:03.460 --> 01:07:04.460]   you're very excited about.
[01:07:04.460 --> 01:07:08.700]   For me, it might be something like Obscuer Store or something like Arts and Letters Daily or
[01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:09.700]   something.
[01:07:09.700 --> 01:07:12.460]   But someplace where somebody's out there doing what amounts to...
[01:07:12.460 --> 01:07:13.460]   Exactly.
[01:07:13.460 --> 01:07:14.460]   Bubbling up interesting content.
[01:07:14.460 --> 01:07:15.460]   Well, that's what bloggers do.
[01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:16.460]   That's what I was thinking.
[01:07:16.460 --> 01:07:17.460]   That's our job.
[01:07:17.460 --> 01:07:23.820]   I mean, that story about Salzberger himself, that which I blogged, that story was pretty
[01:07:23.820 --> 01:07:24.820]   obscure.
[01:07:24.820 --> 01:07:29.260]   That was out in some guy who had been the Davos and happened to be having a chat with him.
[01:07:29.260 --> 01:07:35.100]   And then it went up on this very rare blog and then it just started to trickle into the
[01:07:35.100 --> 01:07:36.100]   system.
[01:07:36.100 --> 01:07:41.940]   Maybe an argument why people's sites, democratic sites like Digarn, is good as actual journalists
[01:07:41.940 --> 01:07:44.260]   or actual editorial types come out there.
[01:07:44.260 --> 01:07:47.620]   Although those sites wouldn't work if there weren't people out there discovering things
[01:07:47.620 --> 01:07:49.620]   on their own because nothing would ever bubble up.
[01:07:49.620 --> 01:07:51.620]   There's a big controversy going on over Digarn.
[01:07:51.620 --> 01:07:55.260]   In fact, we should really get Kevin on it to address it, although...
[01:07:55.260 --> 01:07:56.620]   What's the controversy?
[01:07:56.620 --> 01:07:58.380]   Hey, you blogged it.
[01:07:58.380 --> 01:08:02.300]   Yeah, but well, so the point is I guess that they've changed...
[01:08:02.300 --> 01:08:03.300]   Can you explain what's going on?
[01:08:03.300 --> 01:08:07.980]   Well, they've changed how the top bloggers work or something like that.
[01:08:07.980 --> 01:08:13.500]   Well, they took away the list that says the top 10 or the top 100 users.
[01:08:13.500 --> 01:08:20.300]   And of course, all these guys that are posting like crazy, they'll want to be a better thing
[01:08:20.300 --> 01:08:21.780]   in the top 100.
[01:08:21.780 --> 01:08:26.140]   Well, some of them have left, some of them have stuck around and Kevin said in this blog
[01:08:26.140 --> 01:08:29.300]   that he'd consulted with the top guys.
[01:08:29.300 --> 01:08:33.580]   Well, I got an email from one of the top guys, I'll leave his name out, who says that the
[01:08:33.580 --> 01:08:37.980]   Wall Street Journal has been interviewing the top guys, planning on a piece, talking
[01:08:37.980 --> 01:08:43.220]   about this abandonment of Dig or what's going on with Dig.
[01:08:43.220 --> 01:08:44.220]   I mean, that's true.
[01:08:44.220 --> 01:08:47.100]   The only reason you do this is for the recognition, right?
[01:08:47.100 --> 01:08:48.620]   It's a lot of work.
[01:08:48.620 --> 01:08:55.100]   So the theory goes that Dig is so big now that the top contributors are far less important
[01:08:55.100 --> 01:08:56.540]   than the masses.
[01:08:56.540 --> 01:08:58.860]   Well, I think what Dig's trying to do is to...
[01:08:58.860 --> 01:09:01.820]   Is absolutely the downplay of those guys because they are so important.
[01:09:01.820 --> 01:09:03.940]   They dominate so much.
[01:09:03.940 --> 01:09:10.020]   They do in fact, completely create the character of Dig, don't they?
[01:09:10.020 --> 01:09:15.380]   I don't know enough about the raw numbers.
[01:09:15.380 --> 01:09:16.380]   It is interesting.
[01:09:16.380 --> 01:09:17.780]   It is a bit of a controversy.
[01:09:17.780 --> 01:09:22.500]   Just in prepping for the five minutes I take to prepare for Mac break weekly each week,
[01:09:22.500 --> 01:09:25.380]   I watch some of the popular Mac stories and Apple stories.
[01:09:25.380 --> 01:09:30.780]   And there are a few usernames that come up a lot when you watch the upcoming stories
[01:09:30.780 --> 01:09:32.460]   or the top Apple stories.
[01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:35.780]   And I assume that that's happening still across, I guess, Will would know more than
[01:09:35.780 --> 01:09:36.780]   I do.
[01:09:36.780 --> 01:09:40.180]   You're still seeing a lot of the same because that's who's being watched.
[01:09:40.180 --> 01:09:42.900]   You can almost think of them as "A-list bloggers," right?
[01:09:42.900 --> 01:09:44.540]   The people are watching the same thing.
[01:09:44.540 --> 01:09:48.660]   You know, Corey posts something and everybody links to it and that's how the blog works.
[01:09:48.660 --> 01:09:54.820]   Well, on Dig, if a popular poster or a popular digger adds that link, then a lot of it's
[01:09:54.820 --> 01:09:57.100]   going to get picked up by that person's following.
[01:09:57.100 --> 01:09:59.140]   So I mean, I guess it's just working like blogs.
[01:09:59.140 --> 01:10:02.620]   It is much like blogging, isn't it, without all the work of actually writing anything?
[01:10:02.620 --> 01:10:06.220]   But I'm with you on the reputation part, I mean, there's something that's kind of
[01:10:06.220 --> 01:10:09.140]   ineffable about being the first person to link something.
[01:10:09.140 --> 01:10:12.180]   And I think there's a lot of people who are kind of, it's a good feeling.
[01:10:12.180 --> 01:10:14.460]   You know, there's a reason people do that.
[01:10:14.460 --> 01:10:15.460]   Over?
[01:10:15.460 --> 01:10:17.020]   Yeah, I guess.
[01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:21.580]   I don't know if it's a big story.
[01:10:21.580 --> 01:10:26.300]   Although I have to say that business week, I'm just looking at article in today's business
[01:10:26.300 --> 01:10:28.380]   week that features Kevin Rose.
[01:10:28.380 --> 01:10:30.140]   Oh, for a lot of people.
[01:10:30.140 --> 01:10:33.220]   You sure get in a lot of press with the web now, just for you.
[01:10:33.220 --> 01:10:35.580]   New online tools, it's like they just discovered this.
[01:10:35.580 --> 01:10:39.780]   New online tools offer personalized recommendations to help users find what they like.
[01:10:39.780 --> 01:10:41.620]   This week is so far behind the curve.
[01:10:41.620 --> 01:10:43.580]   Consistently, it's amazing.
[01:10:43.580 --> 01:10:45.060]   They're covering search engines next week?
[01:10:45.060 --> 01:10:47.300]   Yes, next week's search engines on.
[01:10:47.300 --> 01:10:50.460]   They're talking about, it's really interesting.
[01:10:50.460 --> 01:10:55.660]   But they interview Kevin on this dig, a popular bookmarking site.
[01:10:55.660 --> 01:10:56.660]   Okay.
[01:10:56.660 --> 01:10:58.380]   Yeah, journalism.
[01:10:58.380 --> 01:10:59.380]   Okay.
[01:10:59.380 --> 01:11:02.060]   That enables users to submit links to web pages.
[01:11:02.060 --> 01:11:04.300]   Catherine Holahan.
[01:11:04.300 --> 01:11:07.220]   How much is Kevin worth this week according to this?
[01:11:07.220 --> 01:11:08.220]   That's a good question.
[01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:09.220]   I'm looking for that here.
[01:11:09.220 --> 01:11:15.140]   They don't say later this year, dig will launch a recommendation tool able to expose members.
[01:11:15.140 --> 01:11:19.820]   Wow, that doesn't seem like a good idea to fellow.
[01:11:19.820 --> 01:11:25.900]   To fellow diggers who appear to have several similar interests says Rose.
[01:11:25.900 --> 01:11:27.780]   Dig will be smart enough to know what interests you.
[01:11:27.780 --> 01:11:29.820]   This is what John, this is what you were looking for.
[01:11:29.820 --> 01:11:33.140]   The site will identify those with like interests in part by the previous stories they've dug
[01:11:33.140 --> 01:11:34.140]   and buried.
[01:11:34.140 --> 01:11:38.140]   Actually, this is something I thought Dig should do a long time ago.
[01:11:38.140 --> 01:11:40.340]   I don't care about everybody who posted a dig.
[01:11:40.340 --> 01:11:43.220]   There's certain people I'm interested in.
[01:11:43.220 --> 01:11:44.220]   Then it's just like a blog.
[01:11:44.220 --> 01:11:46.300]   You can get a bunch of blogs.
[01:11:46.300 --> 01:11:48.580]   You're making sub blogs from Dig.
[01:11:48.580 --> 01:11:49.580]   Right.
[01:11:49.580 --> 01:11:50.580]   It's friends.
[01:11:50.580 --> 01:11:51.740]   Yeah, I like that feature scene.
[01:11:51.740 --> 01:11:53.380]   It's kind of like you're like your delicious network.
[01:11:53.380 --> 01:11:55.540]   I like that a lot.
[01:11:55.540 --> 01:11:56.540]   Tom, are you back?
[01:11:56.540 --> 01:11:57.540]   Yeah, I'm here.
[01:11:57.540 --> 01:11:58.540]   I lost you briefly there.
[01:11:58.540 --> 01:12:00.940]   I was hearing alarm bells over here.
[01:12:00.940 --> 01:12:01.940]   I heard those alarm bells.
[01:12:01.940 --> 01:12:02.940]   Were you at the office?
[01:12:02.940 --> 01:12:03.940]   Is there a fire?
[01:12:03.940 --> 01:12:04.940]   Do you need to leave?
[01:12:04.940 --> 01:12:05.940]   No, no, it wasn't that kind of alarm.
[01:12:05.940 --> 01:12:07.260]   Oh, we weren't sure what it was.
[01:12:07.260 --> 01:12:10.020]   I think it was a universal power thing just that went belly up.
[01:12:10.020 --> 01:12:11.620]   Oh, that's kind of what it sounded like.
[01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:12.620]   Yeah.
[01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:15.060]   Okay, but if there is anything going on at CNET, you can run out.
[01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:16.060]   It's okay.
[01:12:16.060 --> 01:12:19.460]   No, if the fire alarm goes off, I'm staying.
[01:12:19.460 --> 01:12:20.460]   You know that happened.
[01:12:20.460 --> 01:12:21.460]   God bless you.
[01:12:21.460 --> 01:12:22.460]   That's MTV and we did.
[01:12:22.460 --> 01:12:23.460]   We all stayed now with this shit.
[01:12:23.460 --> 01:12:24.460]   We're not leaving.
[01:12:24.460 --> 01:12:25.740]   We're not done yet.
[01:12:25.740 --> 01:12:31.300]   Any other stories anybody wants to say anything about before we wrap this sucker up?
[01:12:31.300 --> 01:12:33.700]   What was the big story this week on Buzz Out Loud?
[01:12:33.700 --> 01:12:35.180]   I should really listen to all of these.
[01:12:35.180 --> 01:12:36.180]   It was the Steve Jobs stuff.
[01:12:36.180 --> 01:12:37.180]   That's such a story.
[01:12:37.180 --> 01:12:38.900]   Steve Jobs and the EMI DRM-free.
[01:12:38.900 --> 01:12:43.020]   That's big news to our audience because we talk about DRM all the time.
[01:12:43.020 --> 01:12:47.900]   So the fact that they might go DRM-free is huge also because in our predictions show,
[01:12:47.900 --> 01:12:51.820]   I just decided to make a crazy prediction and say one major label would go DRM-free
[01:12:51.820 --> 01:12:52.820]   by the end of the year.
[01:12:52.820 --> 01:12:53.820]   Wow.
[01:12:53.820 --> 01:12:54.820]   So now I feel smart.
[01:12:54.820 --> 01:12:55.820]   Actually, you picked that one.
[01:12:55.820 --> 01:12:58.060]   Well, it might feel smart if they actually do it.
[01:12:58.060 --> 01:12:59.300]   They're never going to do that.
[01:12:59.300 --> 01:13:00.300]   Yeah, you got a whole year.
[01:13:00.300 --> 01:13:01.300]   I think they might.
[01:13:01.300 --> 01:13:02.300]   It could happen.
[01:13:02.300 --> 01:13:03.300]   It could happen.
[01:13:03.300 --> 01:13:06.220]   It's reasonableagreements.org, by the way.
[01:13:06.220 --> 01:13:09.780]   You can create your own end user license agreement that you can wear on a T-shirt or
[01:13:09.780 --> 01:13:15.100]   put in your emails that will release you from any other ULA's that other people are trying
[01:13:15.100 --> 01:13:16.580]   to get you to agree to.
[01:13:16.580 --> 01:13:20.900]   Well, you should, if you get a chance, anybody out there should go to the davork.org/blog
[01:13:20.900 --> 01:13:25.460]   and look at my terms of service if you want to see the absolute best ULA out there.
[01:13:25.460 --> 01:13:26.820]   Where'd you get that one?
[01:13:26.820 --> 01:13:29.620]   I cobbled it together from some real ones.
[01:13:29.620 --> 01:13:31.380]   It's actually quite good.
[01:13:31.380 --> 01:13:33.260]   It's the anti-ULA.
[01:13:33.260 --> 01:13:37.020]   You have to read the whole thing though to get a feeling for it anyway.
[01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:40.820]   At the end, it says, we're not responsible for anything.
[01:13:40.820 --> 01:13:44.340]   Davork.org/blog is the place to go for that.
[01:13:44.340 --> 01:13:46.180]   John C. Dvorak, it's so good to have you.
[01:13:46.180 --> 01:13:47.180]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:13:47.180 --> 01:13:49.180]   Always a pleasure.
[01:13:49.180 --> 01:13:51.380]   We'll see you again next week.
[01:13:51.380 --> 01:13:53.300]   Tom Merritt from BuzzOut Loud.
[01:13:53.300 --> 01:13:55.300]   Go to buzz.cnet.com.
[01:13:55.300 --> 01:13:56.300]   B-O-L.cnet.com.
[01:13:56.300 --> 01:13:57.300]   Oh, Bumps are B-O-L.
[01:13:57.300 --> 01:13:58.300]   That's right.
[01:13:58.300 --> 01:14:00.300]   That's cnet.com.
[01:14:00.300 --> 01:14:01.300]   Molly's at buzz.cnet.com.
[01:14:01.300 --> 01:14:02.700]   Yeah, that's the Molly world.
[01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:04.460]   Don't go to the Molly world.
[01:14:04.460 --> 01:14:05.460]   Go to the Tom world.
[01:14:05.460 --> 01:14:06.460]   Go to both.
[01:14:06.460 --> 01:14:08.020]   Go to both.
[01:14:08.020 --> 01:14:09.020]   Why not?
[01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:10.020]   Love having you on.
[01:14:10.020 --> 01:14:14.780]   Will Harris from Jolly Old, when are you leaving BitTech?
[01:14:14.780 --> 01:14:16.260]   The end of March.
[01:14:16.260 --> 01:14:20.140]   Still at bit-tech.net till then, do you want to tell us what your plans are?
[01:14:20.140 --> 01:14:21.700]   Are you going back to school?
[01:14:21.700 --> 01:14:23.180]   Well, no.
[01:14:23.180 --> 01:14:25.340]   I'm sort of entertaining a couple of things at the moment.
[01:14:25.340 --> 01:14:30.340]   I'm putting together a sort of company idea for startups.
[01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:33.620]   If anybody has about half a million bucks, they want to throw in my direction.
[01:14:33.620 --> 01:14:34.620]   All right.
[01:14:34.620 --> 01:14:35.620]   That'd be great.
[01:14:35.620 --> 01:14:37.420]   It'd be a good investment.
[01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:38.420]   Yeah.
[01:14:38.420 --> 01:14:40.940]   Don't hear any takers.
[01:14:40.940 --> 01:14:47.940]   43folders.com is the place for Merlin Mann, also fives.org.
[01:14:47.940 --> 01:14:48.940]   .com.
[01:14:48.940 --> 01:14:49.940]   .com.
[01:14:49.940 --> 01:14:53.180]   The number five, IVES.com.
[01:14:53.180 --> 01:14:58.020]   And of course, on Twitter, he's hot dogs, ladies.
[01:14:58.020 --> 01:15:01.180]   Is it two hot dogs or are you just saying hot dogs in general?
[01:15:01.180 --> 01:15:02.180]   Oh, no.
[01:15:02.180 --> 01:15:03.180]   It's an offer.
[01:15:03.180 --> 01:15:04.180]   It's a kind of a question.
[01:15:04.180 --> 01:15:05.180]   Hot dogs, ladies.
[01:15:05.180 --> 01:15:06.180]   Hot dogs, ladies.
[01:15:06.180 --> 01:15:07.180]   Hot dogs, ladies.
[01:15:07.180 --> 01:15:08.180]   Okay.
[01:15:08.180 --> 01:15:09.180]   No, I'll say like that.
[01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:10.180]   You know the source of that?
[01:15:10.180 --> 01:15:11.180]   The literacy of dances.
[01:15:11.180 --> 01:15:13.180]   Oh, I love that.
[01:15:13.180 --> 01:15:14.180]   Yeah.
[01:15:14.180 --> 01:15:17.980]   He done it shortly after writing that, didn't he?
[01:15:17.980 --> 01:15:19.620]   I think he did himself in.
[01:15:19.620 --> 01:15:20.620]   His name?
[01:15:20.620 --> 01:15:22.540]   John Kennedy Tool tool?
[01:15:22.540 --> 01:15:23.940]   Yeah.
[01:15:23.940 --> 01:15:26.780]   His mom took the manuscript and had it published after he died.
[01:15:26.780 --> 01:15:28.580]   Well, there you go.
[01:15:28.580 --> 01:15:30.580]   And on that, that upbeat.
[01:15:30.580 --> 01:15:31.580]   Yeah.
[01:15:31.580 --> 01:15:32.580]   Captain Bringdown.
[01:15:32.580 --> 01:15:33.580]   Let's bring it back next week.
[01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:34.580]   Buzzkill.
[01:15:34.580 --> 01:15:37.740]   Buzzkill out loud.
[01:15:37.740 --> 01:15:38.740]   Thank you, everybody.
[01:15:38.740 --> 01:15:41.420]   It's in the can.
[01:15:41.420 --> 01:15:45.740]   Maybe somebody will send you a car.
[01:15:45.740 --> 01:15:47.220]   Hey, there you go.
[01:15:47.220 --> 01:15:48.740]   I could, you know, maybe.
[01:15:48.740 --> 01:15:49.740]   How could we do this?
[01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:50.740]   Go ahead.
[01:15:50.740 --> 01:15:51.740]   Make it play.
[01:15:51.740 --> 01:15:52.740]   Make it play.
[01:15:52.740 --> 01:15:53.740]   Well, you know, I think it should be a Lexus.
[01:15:53.740 --> 01:15:55.740]   I think you should get a little, and you could do Lexus ads on Twitter.
[01:15:55.740 --> 01:15:56.740]   That'd be great.
[01:15:56.740 --> 01:15:58.740]   I think it should be a Lexus.
[01:15:58.740 --> 01:16:08.580]   I think you should get a little, and you could do Lexus ads on Twitter.
[01:16:08.580 --> 01:16:10.980]   You know, like, every week, you know, they do make it.
[01:16:10.980 --> 01:16:13.300]   To be honest about it, I mean, this is my second Lexus.
[01:16:13.300 --> 01:16:17.620]   I should have put on my third by now, but it's the best car I've ever owned ever.
[01:16:17.620 --> 01:16:18.620]   You know what?
[01:16:18.620 --> 01:16:19.620]   It's been quite a lot of Lexus.
[01:16:19.620 --> 01:16:22.620]   It's been quite a lot of Lexus.
[01:16:22.620 --> 01:16:24.620]   I'll add to that.
[01:16:24.620 --> 01:16:26.780]   I bought a Lexus because of you, John.
[01:16:26.780 --> 01:16:27.780]   Right.
[01:16:27.780 --> 01:16:28.780]   You did.
[01:16:28.780 --> 01:16:29.780]   I can't.
[01:16:29.780 --> 01:16:30.780]   Or at least I had some.
[01:16:30.780 --> 01:16:31.780]   You had it.
[01:16:31.780 --> 01:16:32.780]   I couldn't talk into getting the V8.
[01:16:32.780 --> 01:16:33.780]   I got the wrong engine.
[01:16:33.780 --> 01:16:36.180]   He wanted me to get the big engine, and I got the wrong tires.
[01:16:36.180 --> 01:16:38.540]   And every other one, the wrong color.
[01:16:38.540 --> 01:16:41.340]   You told me the silver would peel, and you were right.
[01:16:41.340 --> 01:16:42.580]   Yeah, silver peels.
[01:16:42.580 --> 01:16:46.380]   It's just a problem with that kind of pain period.
[01:16:46.380 --> 01:16:47.380]   Oh, yeah.
[01:16:47.380 --> 01:16:48.380]   That's the fault.
[01:16:48.380 --> 01:16:50.020]   We love Lexus.
[01:16:50.020 --> 01:16:52.380]   Would you like an ISA GS or an LX?
[01:16:52.380 --> 01:16:54.180]   I think we're getting our eyes.
[01:16:54.180 --> 01:16:55.180]   No, I think AC.
[01:16:55.180 --> 01:16:56.180]   That's the one I'm angry with.
[01:16:56.180 --> 01:16:57.180]   Oh, you want the AC?
[01:16:57.180 --> 01:16:58.180]   Yeah.
[01:16:58.180 --> 01:16:59.180]   Oh, that's nice.
[01:16:59.180 --> 01:17:01.580]   Wait, did we just become this week in old days?
[01:17:01.580 --> 01:17:03.260]   Well, this week in paychecks.
[01:17:03.260 --> 01:17:04.260]   We're up right.
[01:17:04.260 --> 01:17:05.260]   We're up right.
[01:17:05.260 --> 01:17:08.500]   We can take the tape and we'll send it to the engine.
[01:17:08.500 --> 01:17:10.580]   We can take it and see what we can do for you.
[01:17:10.580 --> 01:17:12.740]   If the Daily Mail wants to buy ads, we'll sell them ads.
[01:17:12.740 --> 01:17:13.740]   We don't care.
[01:17:13.740 --> 01:17:14.740]   Do the twin.
[01:17:14.740 --> 01:17:15.740]   Do the twin.
[01:17:15.740 --> 01:17:16.740]   All right.
[01:17:16.740 --> 01:17:17.740]   Do the twin, baby.
[01:17:17.740 --> 01:17:18.740]   Do the twin.
[01:17:18.740 --> 01:17:19.740]   All right.
[01:17:19.740 --> 01:17:20.740]   Do the twin.
[01:17:20.740 --> 01:17:21.740]   Baby.
[01:17:21.740 --> 01:17:22.740]   Do the twin.
[01:17:22.740 --> 01:17:23.740]   All right.
[01:17:23.740 --> 01:17:24.740]   Do the twin, baby.
[01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:25.740]   Do the twin.
[01:17:25.740 --> 01:17:26.740]   All right.
[01:17:26.740 --> 01:17:27.740]   Do the twin.
[01:17:27.740 --> 01:17:28.740]   All right.
[01:17:28.740 --> 01:17:29.740]   Do the twin.
[01:17:29.740 --> 01:17:30.740]   All right.
[01:17:30.740 --> 01:17:31.740]   Do the twin.
[01:17:31.740 --> 01:17:32.740]   Baby.
[01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:33.740]   Do the twin.
[01:17:33.740 --> 01:17:34.740]   All right.
[01:17:34.740 --> 01:17:35.740]   Do the twin.
[01:17:35.740 --> 01:17:36.740]   All right.
[01:17:36.740 --> 01:17:37.740]   Do the twin.
[01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:39.400]   You're right, I'm John.
