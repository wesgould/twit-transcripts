[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   This is Twit, this weekend tech, episode 52 for April 30th, 2006.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:13.700]   [music]
[00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:21.600]   Bandwidth for the Twit.tv network is provided by AOL Radio at AOL.com/podcasting.
[00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:31.600]   [music]
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:34.600]   He's back from Brazil and looking sharp.
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.600]   Got that Brazilian wax. I see John C. de Vorac. Hello John.
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:40.600]   Ouch. [laughs]
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:42.600]   What were you doing in Brazil?
[00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:47.600]   I write from magazine. I'm called Info, which is a short for Info. It's Emmy.
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:52.600]   I'm the one that we call theists. They had a 20th anniversary party.
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.600]   So I'm going to help them celebrate.
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:57.600]   That sounds like a good party. Robert Heron is also here.
[00:00:57.600 --> 00:01:01.600]   He had some advice on what to drink in Brazil. What was that that you wanted him to?
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:03.600]   Ooh. What was that?
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:21.600]   [speaking in Spanish]
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.600]   It's essentially the Brazilian version of rum. It doesn't taste like rum.
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:29.600]   It's a distinctive flavor and all the variations have this unique taste.
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.600]   It's made with an olamic still. It's more like rum.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:38.600]   It's more like a brandy. This would be like an almond yolk.
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:45.600]   The almond yolk of rums. David Prager is here who probably has something to add to this conversation as well.
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.600]   Hello David.
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.600]   Hey there. I'm all about different types of alcohol.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:51.600]   This is turning into dig. Dig nation.
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:53.600]   Oh god, I don't know.
[00:01:53.600 --> 00:01:56.600]   No one dig will be talking about the illegal alcohols.
[00:01:56.600 --> 00:02:00.600]   What is it that they can't sell here that's got warm wood in it? I can't think of it.
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:02.600]   Absent.
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.600]   As Kevin about absence.
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:07.600]   Actually you can get warm wood based absence in the United States.
[00:02:07.600 --> 00:02:10.600]   That law changed. Not as powerful as it used to be.
[00:02:10.600 --> 00:02:13.600]   You can go get in the various brands available.
[00:02:13.600 --> 00:02:15.600]   Isn't it highly poisonous?
[00:02:15.600 --> 00:02:17.600]   No, it's over. That's exaggerated.
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:21.600]   I think it's because it's hallucinogenic and they don't want people hallucinating.
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:22.600]   No.
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:25.600]   I think that's exaggerated too.
[00:02:25.600 --> 00:02:29.600]   Well John, we'll let you, you can try it for us and let us know.
[00:02:29.600 --> 00:02:30.600]   I've tried it.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.600]   Oh alright.
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.600]   Did you do the whole thing with the green lady and the poor and sugar.
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:39.600]   No, it's overrated. Let's just make overrated. It was something that was cool in 1900.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:43.600]   Yeah, the turn of the century. Here we are talking about turn of the century technology.
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.600]   Big story of course, I guess. I mean it was kind of a slow week this week.
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:50.600]   If this is the biggest story then that really proves it.
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:54.600]   Nintendo and the Wii.
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:03:06.600]   Actually, I thought I put an article in the show notes that I thought was kind of right on saying that this is really just bogus attempt to get some publicity as we approach E3.
[00:03:06.600 --> 00:03:07.600]   And they're really...
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.600]   Bogus attempt by Nintendo?
[00:03:08.600 --> 00:03:09.600]   Yeah, they're just...
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:12.600]   Bogus attempt... how could it be Bogus? We're giving him publicity now.
[00:03:12.600 --> 00:03:15.600]   It worked. You're right. It's not Bogus, but so what I guess.
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:19.600]   There's no really... there's nothing new to say except that they've changed the name from Revolution to Wii.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:31.600]   Well, I think the main problem, aside from the fact that I'll even agree that Wii is kind of a stupid name, is that they have a significant amount of branding that's invested in Revolution.
[00:03:31.600 --> 00:03:35.600]   Everyone is familiar with Nintendo Revolution and everyone seemed to like it.
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:42.600]   So what basically I think a lot of people have said about is that why throw Nintendo Revolution away?
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:44.600]   Wii is friendlier.
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.600]   Wii.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:49.600]   The more friendly name than Xbox, it's more friendly name than PlayStation.
[00:03:49.600 --> 00:03:51.600]   And since it is, in fact, a kid's...
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:53.600]   Well, look what happened with Windows Me.
[00:03:53.600 --> 00:03:59.600]   Me and Wii. Oh, it could go down. It could be like the Coke Classic of technology. Me and Wii.
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:05.600]   Well, I think Nintendo stands by the merits of their system as a gaming machine and not a home media center.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:11.600]   Aaron McKenna, writing in Tom's Hardware, said that Wii is not even pronounceable in Japanese.
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:18.600]   That the Japanese can't even say it, although they like in France because it means yes in France, right?
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:19.600]   Wii.
[00:04:19.600 --> 00:04:20.600]   Wii.
[00:04:20.600 --> 00:04:21.600]   Say Wii.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:25.600]   But he also points out there's nothing really to say about it and it's just attempting.
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:28.600]   I mean, look, I guess E3, what E3 is, main ninth.
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:34.600]   Microsoft's going to try to get attention by announcing a Blu-ray for the Xbox 360, but all eyes are really...
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.600]   HDV.
[00:04:35.600 --> 00:04:37.600]   Oh, it's HDV, not Blu-ray.
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:38.600]   Oh, no.
[00:04:38.600 --> 00:04:39.600]   Oh, Microsoft.
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:43.600]   Oh, that's right there. Well, I can't follow it all. Sony is Blu-ray.
[00:04:43.600 --> 00:04:45.600]   Microsoft is HD DVD.
[00:04:45.600 --> 00:04:49.600]   Although a lot of computer manufacturers like Blu-ray because it stores more on the disk.
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:51.600]   I mean, it's a better data format, right?
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:52.600]   Supposedly, you know.
[00:04:52.600 --> 00:04:56.600]   But what's available and what are the cost per disk? That's always the big question for blank media.
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:01.600]   None of this stuff is available yet, although the drives are supposedly coming in another month or so.
[00:05:01.600 --> 00:05:08.600]   Actually, I'm told that you can. In fact, I think you can buy blank Blu-ray disks right over there 20 bucks a pop.
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:09.600]   Okay.
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:11.600]   Rewritables are just one right once.
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:12.600]   I think they're just one right right now.
[00:05:12.600 --> 00:05:13.600]   20 bucks.
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:16.600]   I could be wrong, but my understanding is it's a one right verbatim disk.
[00:05:16.600 --> 00:05:19.600]   I think it's 25 gigs for 19 bucks.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:21.600]   And how much data do they store?
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:22.600]   25.
[00:05:22.600 --> 00:05:26.600]   Well, that's not much. And Blu-ray is what? 47? 40?
[00:05:26.600 --> 00:05:27.600]   How much is the Blu-ray?
[00:05:27.600 --> 00:05:28.600]   That is 25.
[00:05:28.600 --> 00:05:29.600]   That is 25.
[00:05:29.600 --> 00:05:31.600]   It's a 25 per layer in the tip.
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.600]   Oh, per layer.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:33.600]   Oh.
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.600]   There's going to be two layers, but with these first writeables, I think there's only one layer available, so it's going to be 25.
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:40.600]   And what is HD DVD? How much does that store?
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:41.600]   15 gigs?
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:42.600]   Okay.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:43.600]   And then each layer.
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:48.600]   And then so they were looking at a three layer disk for 45 or combinations thereof.
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.600]   Right.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:53.600]   Something like that. It's kind of a confused mess right now.
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.600]   The players are out though.
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:05:56.600]   If you can find one.
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:58.600]   Is there a Blu-ray? I know HD DVDs out.
[00:05:58.600 --> 00:05:59.600]   HD DVDs out, yes.
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.600]   Blu-ray still might have.
[00:06:00.600 --> 00:06:01.600]   Yeah.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:03.600]   Blu-rays another month and a half.
[00:06:03.600 --> 00:06:04.600]   Sorry.
[00:06:04.600 --> 00:06:06.600]   Blu-rays another month and a half.
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.600]   HDs are sold out.
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.600]   I just got a flyer and a magazine.
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.600]   It's May 23rd and it's official Blu-ray disk.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:13.600]   Oh, really? They moved it to May 23rd?
[00:06:13.600 --> 00:06:15.600]   So there's actual advertising out in the place now.
[00:06:15.600 --> 00:06:17.600]   Yeah, but you know they had to place that at that.
[00:06:17.600 --> 00:06:20.600]   I mean, I just got a brand new home theater magazine and cool.
[00:06:20.600 --> 00:06:21.600]   They had to place that at three months ago.
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:24.600]   I think that's probably that's when they thought they were going to have it out, right?
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:29.600]   What's the turnaround for ad time in magazines? It's months, right?
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:30.600]   No, not anymore.
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:32.600]   Actually, the ads going last.
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:33.600]   Oh, all right.
[00:06:33.600 --> 00:06:36.600]   And this was when you could actually pull out of the magazine, of course.
[00:06:36.600 --> 00:06:39.600]   Oh, it's a blow and that could go really like the last minute.
[00:06:39.600 --> 00:06:40.600]   Oh, really?
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.600]   All right.
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.600]   Most of these magazines like PC Magazine using Quark to put other publishing together or what?
[00:06:45.600 --> 00:06:46.600]   Do you know?
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:48.600]   You know, I was just running, I just ran into it.
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:53.600]   I was at a magazine the other day and they were using Quark and which they, I think still most people do.
[00:06:53.600 --> 00:06:59.600]   But everybody seems to be talking about or moving to InDesign and I think that's really the future of this stuff.
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:00.600]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:07:00.600 --> 00:07:02.600]   They use Quark because they have used Quark.
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:03.600]   They have Quark.
[00:07:03.600 --> 00:07:08.600]   You know, there's, you know, it's just, there's a lot of inertia but InDesign is so much better.
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:16.600]   Although ironically Quark came out in an Intel dual binary before they were able to do that with InDesign.
[00:07:16.600 --> 00:07:18.600]   Well, before Quark it was PageMaker.
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:19.600]   Right.
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:20.600]   PageMaker is gone.
[00:07:20.600 --> 00:07:24.600]   Well, you know, Quark, you know, is also, I mean, people don't like working on them.
[00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:25.600]   They're quite arrogant.
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:27.600]   Oh, really? Is that part of the problem?
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:29.600]   Well, I mean, I found it to be the case.
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:34.600]   InDesign is from Adobe, of course, and, you know, if you're already in Adobe House, it's an easy thing to do.
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:39.600]   I shouldn't say PageMaker is gone. Adobe owns it. I don't know if they, I mean, I don't know if people still use it but it's there.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:42.600]   Yeah, and actually I think Framemakers also, by Adobe.
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:43.600]   Framemakers, wow.
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:44.600]   I think that's still available.
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:46.600]   I think Book Publishers still use it.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:51.600]   Well, that's the thing. If you've got a workflow all tied into one particular program, it's a lot to change it over.
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:53.600]   How do we get to this from Blu-ray? I don't know.
[00:07:53.600 --> 00:07:54.600]   Well, I don't know.
[00:07:54.600 --> 00:07:55.600]   That's a good one.
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.600]   We're talking about the depending on that.
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:57.600]   Nobody knows how.
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:02.600]   So HDVDs already, I already got some movies released though, I believe.
[00:08:02.600 --> 00:08:04.600]   Yeah, it's just the hardware right now.
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:08.600]   I haven't seen it for sale since the initial launch, those initial 10,000 units.
[00:08:08.600 --> 00:08:26.600]   Well, the interesting press release, the interesting press release that came across my desk this week was the announcement by Warner Home video that they will be producing all their DVDs with DVD 9 on one side and the flip side will be an HD DVD disc format.
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:29.600]   So you can flip the thing over and use it in the future.
[00:08:29.600 --> 00:08:33.600]   DVD 9 is Microsoft's DVD Extreme format, is that right?
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.600]   Well, no, DVD 9 is just to layer.
[00:08:36.600 --> 00:08:37.600]   Oh, standard DVD?
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.600]   Yes, standard DVD.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:40.600]   So, standard DVD 9?
[00:08:40.600 --> 00:08:43.600]   That's the term for the dual layer version.
[00:08:43.600 --> 00:08:46.600]   Okay, so DVD 5 for single layer, DVD 9 for dual layer.
[00:08:46.600 --> 00:08:48.600]   So they're going to have hybrid DVDs, then.
[00:08:48.600 --> 00:08:51.600]   They'll have one that plays in the old player and you flip it over and plays in the new player.
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.600]   Yeah, that's pretty cool.
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:55.600]   I think it's not only cool, but it's a stroke of genius.
[00:08:55.600 --> 00:09:02.600]   And this is not really nothing new if you remember when they were no such thing as a DVD 9 early on, just a DVD 5.
[00:09:02.600 --> 00:09:05.600]   They used to bring out, in fact, I have a few of these.
[00:09:05.600 --> 00:09:13.600]   A disc with one side would be normal 4 by, whatever, the ratio is 4 by 3 and the flip side would be a letter box.
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.600]   Right, I have a few of those.
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:16.600]   Netflix, I still get them from Netflix.
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:24.600]   Right, so they have the equipment to make those and you can use the old equipment to make the new HD DVD so that makes it easy to do this process.
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:29.600]   And so I think this is really a dangerous situation for Blu-ray.
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:31.600]   I want that just for comparison purposes.
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:37.600]   It'd be nice to, you know, if you have a good enough TV, compare the quality to DVD format versus HD DVD.
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:42.600]   Are Blu-ray and HD DVD so different that you couldn't do the same thing with them?
[00:09:42.600 --> 00:09:53.600]   Well, the problem with technically, the HD DVD is the old-fashioned style of making this where the reflective coating is deep inside the plastic.
[00:09:53.600 --> 00:10:02.600]   Usually all the way on the other side, on the back, although you can push it down a little bit because of these dual flip-ables they can put it in the middle.
[00:10:02.600 --> 00:10:06.600]   But the Blu-ray, the reflective coating is on the top.
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:16.600]   In other words, pretty much where the Blu-ray is hitting as opposed to underneath the label.
[00:10:16.600 --> 00:10:26.600]   And, you know, I was thinking about that myself. I think it's almost possible for the Blu-ray to make the same kind of thing.
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:35.600]   But the problem there is the equipment because the compatible equipment for HD DVD makes it kind of simple and brain-dead to do this flip-able.
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:37.600]   It's so similar to the old DVD format.
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:40.600]   Right, it's the same equipment, the same stamping equipment.
[00:10:40.600 --> 00:10:47.600]   With Blu-ray, it's new equipment and you'd have to have a hybrid type of gear that out. I just don't think it's possible.
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:54.600]   Sony did do something similar with SACD where they would, on the top layer, it would appear to be a standard CD audio disc.
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:10:58.600]   But if it would read below that first layer, it would be the SACD part of the disc.
[00:10:58.600 --> 00:11:01.600]   And that was kind of neat because you'd have backward compatibility on the single side.
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:04.600]   But I don't know if they can do that with video or not.
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:12.600]   You know, there's some real issues. When we, a year ago, were talking about this, it seemed very clear and everybody seemed confident that there would be dual format players.
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:14.600]   So you wouldn't have to worry about it. You just buy it.
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:17.600]   Yeah, you know, that came up in the conversation a couple of times.
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:20.600]   I did it actually, it just happened on cranky geeks, too.
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:23.600]   And I think we've talked about it on this show a couple of times.
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:24.600]   What happened?
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:30.600]   Well, what happened? It turns out that if you've licensed Blu-ray, there's provisions that don't allow you to do the other formats.
[00:11:30.600 --> 00:11:34.600]   If you're a machine man, in other words, if I'm, that's what happened with Samsung.
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.600]   Samsung said, "Yeah, we're going to do a dual thing."
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:38.600]   And then next thing you know, they pulled a plug on it.
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:49.600]   It turns out that because they signed up with Blu-ray, they can't make a dual machine because they're contract, which was non-disclosed, by the way, which is why nobody knew about it because of some non-disclosure agreement.
[00:11:49.600 --> 00:11:52.600]   It wouldn't allow them to make a dual machine.
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:55.600]   So even if somebody makes the mechanism, it doesn't mean you can produce one legally.
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:01.600]   The greed of these companies is going to bite them in the butt now because this is just the whole thing's going to fall apart.
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:06.600]   Well, who needs it? I mean, no, I don't think American consumers are going to go for this.
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:09.600]   Well, you know, LG claims that they're still going to do one.
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.600]   I don't know how they're going to get away with it, but that's what they say.
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:21.600]   I saw some specs for a Pioneer Drive, too. I don't know if it's a Rimmer or not, but the generation coming up this October, November, and it literally supported every disk format.
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:26.600]   It was a PC Drive, granted, but HDVD, Blu-ray, CD, DVD, everything.
[00:12:26.600 --> 00:12:32.600]   Well, you know, I had a conversation curiously that you mentioned Pioneer with Pioneer just like a week ago.
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:36.600]   The guy who's the head of the Blu-ray division. Andy Parsons?
[00:12:36.600 --> 00:12:38.600]   I don't know. I can't maybe.
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:39.600]   He's a good guy.
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:42.600]   He told me that there's no way they're going to do a dual thing in these things.
[00:12:42.600 --> 00:12:43.600]   No.
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:44.600]   Bad idea.
[00:12:44.600 --> 00:12:47.600]   In fact, both sides say it, they think it's a bad idea, but who knows?
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.600]   That may actually even be in the non-disclosure agreement.
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:50.600]   You have to say that.
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:54.600]   You have to say it's a bad idea. Why would it be a bad idea?
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:55.600]   I don't understand.
[00:12:55.600 --> 00:12:56.600]   Because it costs so much.
[00:12:56.600 --> 00:12:57.600]   I was baffled by this.
[00:12:57.600 --> 00:12:58.600]   You know what?
[00:12:58.600 --> 00:12:59.600]   It's a good idea. It's what consumers want.
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:00.600]   Was he smiling when he said that?
[00:13:00.600 --> 00:13:02.600]   You know, here's what we'd have with the conversation.
[00:13:02.600 --> 00:13:03.600]   We went like this.
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:08.600]   It would be a bad idea because it would be bad for retailers because they'd have to stock both formats.
[00:13:08.600 --> 00:13:10.600]   And I'm thinking, I'm not expecting that.
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:11.600]   That makes no sense.
[00:13:11.600 --> 00:13:12.600]   They wouldn't.
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:13.600]   In fact, that's the whole point.
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:14.600]   They wouldn't have to stock both formats.
[00:13:14.600 --> 00:13:16.600]   But no, I mean, this is completely baffling.
[00:13:16.600 --> 00:13:22.600]   If you read the literature, apparently somebody had Sony blew up at a press conference about
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:25.600]   this idea that you can do to a dual format.
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:26.600]   I don't know.
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:27.600]   I don't know why, believe me.
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:30.600]   This is just going to be a bloodbath for about two years.
[00:13:30.600 --> 00:13:31.600]   It's just so ugly.
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:34.600]   And I think consumers are just going to say throw up their hands.
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:38.600]   Why should they have to choose sides and award it and start?
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.600]   I mean, they're just going to say fine.
[00:13:40.600 --> 00:13:41.600]   I like DVD 9.
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:42.600]   It's fine.
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:43.600]   I'll just stick with that.
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:47.600]   I think the smartest thing to do is this HD dual format.
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:51.600]   I think that's the first smart thing I've heard in this whole thing.
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:56.600]   I mean, no single format side thing is the official winner and they couldn't narrow it down
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:14:01.600]   to a single format for consumers for high definition, next generation optical disc formats.
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:05.600]   I think it's up to consumers then to wait for a dual format player for the most people.
[00:14:05.600 --> 00:14:07.600]   I mean, if you're an early adopter, you buy what you want.
[00:14:07.600 --> 00:14:08.600]   Well, obviously, it'll look great.
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:09.600]   It's going to look great.
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:13.600]   I think we're willing to spend 500 bucks for it, but I can't imagine that a lot of people
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:14.600]   are going to run out here.
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:20.600]   Well, you know, there's another aspect to this, which is that it's the computer users need
[00:14:20.600 --> 00:14:25.600]   some sort of a device to collect more data than put them on these discs for storage.
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:28.600]   But the consumer side, it was either Prager or Heron.
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:34.600]   I can't remember which of the two mentioned somewhere that, you know, if you use MPEG-4,
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:41.600]   you put HD on a regular DVD with room to spare, maybe that is probably the short-term alternative
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:42.600]   to all this stuff.
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.600]   I actually have a player in from JVC.
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:51.600]   It's manufactured by another company, but it supports Windows Media 9 HD and Divx HD formats,
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:55.600]   as well as being a network appliance where you can plug it into your home network and
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.600]   access your media center PC or whatever.
[00:14:57.600 --> 00:14:58.600]   You know who it's going to be the big one?
[00:14:58.600 --> 00:15:01.600]   That's who's going to be the big winners out of this is the computer companies that come up
[00:15:01.600 --> 00:15:08.600]   with, whether it's H.264 or Windows Media 9, come up with it with electronic high-def formats
[00:15:08.600 --> 00:15:10.600]   that can be distributed over the net.
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:12.600]   And nobody will buy a disc again.
[00:15:12.600 --> 00:15:13.600]   Right?
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:15.600]   Or is it just over the file size is too big?
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.600]   Well, there's the broadband issue.
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:18.600]   The file size is too big.
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:23.600]   Yeah, little instrumentals are huge, especially for that kind of quality.
[00:15:23.600 --> 00:15:28.600]   Well, I mean, I'm downloading my high-def versions of Lost in 24.
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:31.600]   They're about 350 megs for 40 minutes.
[00:15:31.600 --> 00:15:35.600]   Yeah, but then you know, you do it a bit, you do it a bit, Tor, and it's not a big deal.
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:39.600]   And some of the estimates I've seen just simply going from MPEG-2 to MPEG-4 for high-definition,
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:44.600]   it's not a doubling or a doubling of savings in terms of space on the disc,
[00:15:44.600 --> 00:15:49.600]   but it's they're saying it's more about maybe a good 20% at this point as well.
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:56.600]   So it's either you take the high bit rate like HDVD is doing with less compression or
[00:15:56.600 --> 00:15:58.600]   for some of the early Blu-ray stuff I've seen.
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:16:03.600]   They've significantly more compression, but at slower bit rates.
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:06.600]   Well, I'll tell you what, you're right about the bandwidth.
[00:16:06.600 --> 00:16:11.600]   You see this from Forbes that they estimate that right now YouTube is spending a million
[00:16:11.600 --> 00:16:14.600]   dollars a month on bandwidth alone.
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:17.600]   That isn't, how much money did they get in VC?
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:20.600]   Well, they got 11, at that rate they got 11 months.
[00:16:20.600 --> 00:16:23.600]   So they got well, well, well under a year to survive.
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:25.600]   Yeah, they got 11 and a half to a half.
[00:16:25.600 --> 00:16:30.600]   So if they're burn rate for bandwidth alone is a million bucks a month.
[00:16:30.600 --> 00:16:33.600]   What's their money making schemes at all?
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:36.600]   They're supposed to support themselves on advertising or what?
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:37.600]   It's what everybody's doing.
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.600]   If you build it, if you get eyeballs, you'll somehow make it.
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:43.600]   So it's just like the .com bubble 1.0.
[00:16:43.600 --> 00:16:46.600]   They got to suck or somebody into buying them.
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:47.600]   That's what their scheme is.
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:51.600]   But I don't think anybody's gunno anymore because I think people are realizing how much
[00:16:51.600 --> 00:16:52.600]   this stuff costs.
[00:16:52.600 --> 00:16:55.600]   I mean, when you see a story in Forbes that says a million dollars a month in bandwidth,
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:58.600]   Yahoo's already burning from Flickr.
[00:16:58.600 --> 00:17:02.600]   They're not going to spend more money knowing that it'll cost them a million a month just to keep the side up.
[00:17:02.600 --> 00:17:08.600]   The only problem is that they're obviously, it's proven that there's a massive demand for this.
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:10.600]   Oh yeah, it's going to break my kids heart.
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:12.600]   They live on YouTube.
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:14.600]   What is my space spending?
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:15.600]   Oh, it must be similar, right?
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:16.600]   I mean, they don't do video.
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:18.600]   I think about the advertising involvement in my space.
[00:17:18.600 --> 00:17:22.600]   But all I see on my space is like datesomethingrather.com.
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:24.600]   My space is doing, I think pretty.
[00:17:24.600 --> 00:17:26.600]   You know, there was a good article I just read.
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:27.600]   It wasn't The Times.
[00:17:27.600 --> 00:17:30.600]   Yeah, it was Last Sunday's Times about My Space.
[00:17:30.600 --> 00:17:33.600]   You know, one of the saddest stories about My Space is the founders.
[00:17:33.600 --> 00:17:37.600]   When Murdoch bought it, the founders didn't get any money.
[00:17:37.600 --> 00:17:39.600]   Or it got a very small amount of money.
[00:17:39.600 --> 00:17:40.600]   It was the company.
[00:17:40.600 --> 00:17:41.600]   Well, then they screwed up.
[00:17:41.600 --> 00:17:42.600]   Yeah, no kidding, the parent company.
[00:17:42.600 --> 00:17:46.600]   Murdoch in order to keep everybody happy gave them bonuses, a multi-million dollar bonuses.
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:50.600]   But the payment, the big payment for My Space, what was it?
[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:54.600]   Half a billion dollar payment went to the parent company, not to the founders.
[00:17:54.600 --> 00:17:57.600]   However, I think My Space is going to do just fine.
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:17:59.600]   I don't think there's any question My Space is making money.
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:03.600]   Every story I see about My Space is about sexual predators.
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:04.600]   Every story.
[00:18:04.600 --> 00:18:06.600]   Oh, there was just, you know, and it's kind of bogus.
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.600]   I just read an article by a mother.
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:10.600]   I read it too.
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:11.600]   Yeah.
[00:18:11.600 --> 00:18:12.600]   What was that?
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:13.600]   The LA Times?
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:14.600]   I can't remember where I saw it.
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:17.600]   The LA Times, she was talking about how she struck a deal with her daughter.
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:20.600]   And she is to monitor her daughter's space on My Space.
[00:18:20.600 --> 00:18:21.600]   Which is right, by the way.
[00:18:21.600 --> 00:18:24.600]   If you can't answer the space on My Space, you should be able to look at it.
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:29.600]   And that she was able to almost foster a better relationship with her daughter by both of them.
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:33.600]   Like, her daughter helped her mom create a account on My Space.
[00:18:33.600 --> 00:18:34.600]   I don't know what's all good.
[00:18:34.600 --> 00:18:35.600]   Together, yes.
[00:18:35.600 --> 00:18:38.600]   What kind of getting with your children works?
[00:18:38.600 --> 00:18:40.600]   This is nothing new.
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:43.600]   My wife did the same thing with my son when he was, you know,
[00:18:43.600 --> 00:18:45.600]   in high school.
[00:18:45.600 --> 00:18:50.600]   She'd go on Live Journal where all these came from.
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:53.600]   Live Journal was the My Space of a couple of years ago, absolutely.
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.600]   Yeah, and she would just look and see what all these kids were.
[00:18:55.600 --> 00:18:58.600]   You know, if you're going to hang out with some teacher, she could do the research.
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:00.600]   And I think it's a great thing.
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:05.600]   You can kind of, you know, it's kind of, it's a funny kind of spying, but it's no different than seeing who shows up at the door.
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:08.600]   You know, with a bone in his nose.
[00:19:08.600 --> 00:19:13.600]   Ladies and gentlemen, that laughter is Patrick Norton who's just joined us.
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:21.600]   He's been moving furniture all day, but is taking time out to take his sweat and pain-soaked frame and join us on this weekend tag.
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:24.600]   We must be talking about like spying on children in My Space.
[00:19:24.600 --> 00:19:26.600]   Yes, congratulations. You're going to be in the pool.
[00:19:26.600 --> 00:19:28.600]   Oh, you missed the good stuff already.
[00:19:28.600 --> 00:19:34.600]   I don't know. This is like, I was on an email thread when I checked in and found out about the show today.
[00:19:34.600 --> 00:19:42.600]   So there's another email thread going, "Grandma, friend of mine's like, I don't have kids yet, but I'm looking at this person's, this adult's response to their child's activities in My Space."
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:48.600]   And some part of me is like, you know, there are kids who are smart enough to hide it from their parents and their kids who aren't.
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:53.600]   And if you're, you know, if you're talking about who is in the closet giving who, you know, what?
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:59.600]   No, it's just like, you know, yeah, if you're, if you're not smart enough to hide it, you're nothing to worry about.
[00:19:59.600 --> 00:20:10.600]   Well, yeah, it's just, you know, you, guess what? You know, if your parents don't approve of you having, you know, premarital intercourse at a party at the age of 14, maybe you shouldn't blog about it in public space.
[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:16.600]   Yeah, on the other hand, if my daughter were doing that, I'd sure hope she blogs about it so that I know so that I could do something about it.
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:20.600]   What are you going to do, Leo? Spanker. I don't know.
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.600]   Blocker in a room until she's 18.
[00:20:22.600 --> 00:20:24.600]   Oh, you know, it's a nice theory.
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:25.600]   Good luck.
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:26.600]   Yeah, it's pretty.
[00:20:26.600 --> 00:20:30.600]   Well, let's personal anecdotes out there. Let the employers take a look at that.
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:36.600]   I do think that kids need their own place, and I think MySpace is a great place.
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:44.600]   I'd rather her have her own place to act out than, then, you know, go down as some, you know, sleazy part of town in the middle of the night.
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:47.600]   Or just a neighbor's house at a kid, a bunch of kids getting together for a party.
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.600]   That was last night, actually.
[00:20:49.600 --> 00:20:58.600]   Well, I mean, but this is, you know, MySpace just makes it easier for you to find these people all over the country instead of just, you know, I have a 14-year-old daughter.
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:00.600]   This is a very sensitive topic for me, okay?
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:18.600]   And I'm not saying it's not sensitive, but I remember, like, you know, one of the funniest conversations I ever watched my mom and dad have was like, you know, or my dad told me about it later, you know, me and a bunch of guys at senior week had met a bunch of women from the University of Vermont,
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:23.600]   and we went to a party at their house, and my mom was like, "Oh, you know, I trust there was adult supervision there."
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:28.600]   You know, my dad kind of looks at me and I immediately riff off on, "Of course, mom."
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:28.600]   You know, not pointing out that the adult supervision were the, you know, the group of 21-year-old women whose, you know, house we were at at at that party at that party at that party at that party at that party at that party at that party at that party at that party at that party at that party at that party at that party at that party at that party at that party at that party at that party at that party at that party at that party at that party at that party at that party at that party at that party at that party at that party at that party at that party at that party at that party at that party at that party at that party at that party at that party at that party at that party at that party at that party at that party at
[00:21:28.600 --> 00:21:39.600]   Yes, mom. Not pointing out that the adult supervision were the, you know, the group of 21-year-old women whose, you know, house we were at at the party at. That's adult. They were adults. They were certainly in charge.
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:41.600]   The word adult is great.
[00:21:41.600 --> 00:21:50.600]   I mean, how many irresponsible adults can we all think of amongst our immediate friends, much less examples we run into, you know, in the news?
[00:21:50.600 --> 00:22:01.600]   I mean, look, I think it's important kids have their own place. I think my space is important. I think a lot of the negative Myspace stuff is just hysteria and bogus.
[00:22:01.600 --> 00:22:07.600]   But every parent I know is worried in this conversation. I hear it everywhere. Every parent is talking about this.
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:15.600]   Well, are you worried as a parent, are you worried about Myspace itself? Are you worried about becoming, or are you worried about predatory behavior of other people?
[00:22:15.600 --> 00:22:24.600]   It's a facilitator for predatory behavior. And you just, but it's the same. It's, you know what, it's the same anywhere. If they're online, even if they're in the mall, it's the same. I mean, it's not any different.
[00:22:24.600 --> 00:22:38.600]   It's also for stupid people. I mean, no, the predators being the stupid people. If you're, it's not anonymous, and the people they get caught are ridiculous. I mean, they say, they say they're damn-
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:48.600]   They say exactly who they are, and they're wondering why someone finds them when they go to meet someone at some pier on the beach. I mean, give me a break.
[00:22:48.600 --> 00:22:58.600]   I think that's okay, man. Just smile. Every local municipality in the country now has at least one undercover cop in Myspace. The chances are better of meeting cops in Myspace than there are-
[00:22:58.600 --> 00:23:03.600]   I think so too. Everyone's on their own stakeout mission. I bet you, if you was on a mission-
[00:23:03.600 --> 00:23:09.600]   They all have a, like these little funny little dinky electronics crimes units. And that's exactly what they're doing. They're most of the time they're in Myspace.
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:13.600]   What are we going to do about cops who are predators? That's another problem.
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:29.600]   It's true. Hey, speaking of which, did you see that the EFF's lawsuit against the, against the NSA and NT, AT&T is probably going to get thrown out because the Bush administration is going to assert the rarely used state's secret privilege?
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:36.600]   No, no, you're mispronouncing it. That's Star Chamber. You know what? You say that, but it's a vestige of English common law.
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:40.600]   That's why I'm saying that. That's just the spookiest thing I've heard of in forever.
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:49.600]   So the rule is, it's like executive privilege. It's just something an executive can assert that if this civil- he can quash a civil suit.
[00:23:49.600 --> 00:23:56.600]   If this civil suit were to continue, it would be at the risk of national security, so we're just going to quash it.
[00:23:56.600 --> 00:24:12.600]   Now, they haven't done it yet, but they say they will when they file papers May 12th, and the government says the fact that the US will assert the state's secret's privilege get this should not be construed as confirmation or denial of any of the allegations.
[00:24:12.600 --> 00:24:21.600]   But if it is somehow revealing state secrets, clearly the NSA is spying on us at the AD&D, right?
[00:24:21.600 --> 00:24:30.600]   Do we care? I don't know. It's, you know, if the president does it, it's not a crime. It's very, you know, there's some spooky stuff going on.
[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:32.600]   Encrypt, encrypt everything. That's my motto.
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:37.600]   No, was the EFF trying to find out who was being monitored?
[00:24:37.600 --> 00:24:54.600]   The EFF was suing AT&T over the fact that it's been asserted, although not proven, the National Security Agency was using AT&T's lines to spy on American phone calls and American Internet communications.
[00:24:54.600 --> 00:25:02.600]   And so the concern of the Bush administration is if this lawsuit were to continue, national security would be put at risk.
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:13.600]   I mean, I have to read into that that something will, we talked about this whistleblower last week of the week before, who says he installed this room in AT&T's offices for the NSA.
[00:25:13.600 --> 00:25:19.600]   I mean, all of it, I think all you can say is it proves it's true.
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:30.600]   Well, I mean, I mean, just to play devil's advocate for a moment, you know, what if they were legitimately, you know, listening in on the works of Al Qaeda cells in the United States?
[00:25:30.600 --> 00:25:33.600]   And they didn't want Al Qaeda to know they were doing that.
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:44.600]   Well, you know, they can probably assume it by now, but of course with state secrets privilege, we have no way to know what they're doing or who they're listening in so they can find out who's going to vote against them and then have the IRS come down again.
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:46.600]   Yeah, it's not such a big deal.
[00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:48.600]   There you go.
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:55.600]   Well, I mean, we laugh, but you know, for a lot of people, there's a lot of nervous people in the United States that think that's a perfectly reasonable exercise of authority.
[00:25:55.600 --> 00:26:01.600]   Well, and that's the issue. I mean, nobody is against trying to track down terrorists this way.
[00:26:01.600 --> 00:26:06.600]   What we're against is the misuse of this kind of power and the fact that it's not.
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:13.600]   And now they're asserting this ancient privilege to quash it, to keep a lack of public oversight.
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:15.600]   So let's just...
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:22.600]   Hey, now I can get my plug in for the blog at the vorak.org/blog, but if you go to my website, there's another story that's similar to it.
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:27.600]   I have very little play, which is the fact that the Bush administration is trying to get...
[00:26:27.600 --> 00:26:35.600]   So if somebody leaks a secret document, even though they wouldn't even know it was secret, the journalists, they just get thrown in the slammer.
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:37.600]   With no recourse? No, no.
[00:26:37.600 --> 00:26:44.600]   I mean, this is very Hugo Chavez style, you know, dealing with the press by just jailing people.
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:48.600]   Now, wouldn't the president then be putting himself in danger of going to prison because...
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:49.600]   I mean, he would feel the secret.
[00:26:49.600 --> 00:26:51.600]   No, he's allowed to declassify secrets.
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:56.600]   Okay, because it wasn't finally traced back to the president, it has been someone to leak that CIA operative's name.
[00:26:56.600 --> 00:26:58.600]   It's okay if he does it.
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:06.600]   It wasn't the CIA operative's name, it was the Niger-Uranium story, but nevertheless, he's allowed to declassify...
[00:27:06.600 --> 00:27:08.600]   They say he's allowed to declassify DACA.
[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:10.600]   Well, aren't there channels for that?
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:12.600]   No, no, he can just do it unilaterally, I think.
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:13.600]   By fear.
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:14.600]   Right, by fear.
[00:27:14.600 --> 00:27:15.600]   That's what I heard.
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:16.600]   Yeah.
[00:27:16.600 --> 00:27:17.600]   It's good to be the king.
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:18.600]   At least that's their position.
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:22.600]   I don't think we'll see this go to court, but if it were, I think that that's their defense.
[00:27:22.600 --> 00:27:23.600]   It's good to be the king.
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.600]   I thought we got rid of kings.
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:28.600]   [laughter]
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:29.600]   Pard.
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:32.600]   Wikipedia is being used by a political campaign.
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:33.600]   What a surprise.
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:36.600]   By political dirty tricksters.
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:43.600]   You know, we knew that Capitol Hill staffers were making revisions in their bosses' bios to make them better,
[00:27:43.600 --> 00:27:47.600]   but apparently they're also going in there and modifying the opponents' bios.
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:51.600]   The entry for Democratic Representative Jim Marshall of Georgia labeled him,
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:55.600]   "This is his biography in Wikipedia, too liberal for his state."
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:27:56.600]   [laughter]
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:28:02.600]   Partly because Hillary Clinton's political action committee donated money to his campaign.
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:04.600]   You know, this sort of thing was predictable.
[00:28:04.600 --> 00:28:05.600]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:28:05.600 --> 00:28:08.600]   There's just too many, you know, vandals in the world.
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:11.600]   Well, in fact, I'm surprised it took him so long.
[00:28:11.600 --> 00:28:16.600]   But I guess it underscores the point that if you're getting your information from Wikipedia alone,
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:19.600]   you probably should consider other sources.
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:23.600]   Well, for a while, Wikipedia was turning into quite an extraordinary resource.
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:24.600]   Well, it still is.
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:31.600]   As long as you stay in, like, you know, non-scientific, evolutionary, political, you know.
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:33.600]   As long as it's not controversial.
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:34.600]   Wait a second.
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:35.600]   What's the point about Armadillos?
[00:28:35.600 --> 00:28:36.600]   It's good.
[00:28:36.600 --> 00:28:40.600]   Well, as long as you're talking about Armadillos being created, not evolved.
[00:28:40.600 --> 00:28:42.600]   That's a good point.
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:47.600]   Well, wasn't there a study done that just as many falsities were found?
[00:28:47.600 --> 00:28:50.600]   And the average scientific Wikipedia entry is in...
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:52.600]   You're talking about the nature in Encyclopedia Britannica.
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:53.600]   You're talking about the nature study.
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:57.600]   Although Encyclopedia Britannica's response was that nature study was very flawed.
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:04.600]   What they didn't talk about was the fact that nevertheless, there were many flaws found in, you know, inaccuracies found in the Encyclopedia Britannica articles.
[00:29:04.600 --> 00:29:07.600]   Look at every source has flaws in it.
[00:29:07.600 --> 00:29:12.600]   Yeah, but most sources can't be rewritten by people, you know, at whim on the fly.
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:15.600]   Are you talking about Adam Curry here rewriting his own bio?
[00:29:15.600 --> 00:29:20.600]   Well, Adam Curry, the opposite of various senators and, you know...
[00:29:20.600 --> 00:29:22.600]   I have a confession to make.
[00:29:22.600 --> 00:29:27.600]   I did not know that you weren't supposed to work on your own bio.
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.600]   That is apparently the...
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:31.600]   How nor is this the law of the wiki?
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:32.600]   The unridden law of the wiki.
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:33.600]   Maybe it's written somewhere.
[00:29:33.600 --> 00:29:34.600]   I didn't see it.
[00:29:34.600 --> 00:29:35.600]   Well, it's the selfish thing to do.
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:36.600]   Well, no, no.
[00:29:36.600 --> 00:29:37.600]   Somebody...
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:38.600]   The guy correcting his own bio.
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:39.600]   I corrected my bio.
[00:29:39.600 --> 00:29:40.600]   It was...
[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:41.600]   Oh, what?
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:42.600]   I didn't put a puff piece in there.
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:44.600]   I wouldn't take out anything that was negative about it.
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:47.600]   There was a factual error which I eliminated.
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:55.600]   Is it going to get to the point where you go to a Wikipedia page and you'll have an option to flick on a little overlay that shows you every edit that everyone made?
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:56.600]   It's not a bad idea.
[00:29:56.600 --> 00:29:58.600]   I think you can't in a way if you look at the revisions history.
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:29:59.600]   You can't track it.
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:00.600]   Yeah.
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:01.600]   You look at the revisions history.
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:04.600]   It's pretty easy to have.
[00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:10.600]   Most of us can probably come up with at least one friend to make the edits in our bio for a bus.
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:16.600]   Now we know Patrick has his friends bid on his eBay auctions just by that comment.
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:19.600]   I don't think much about kidding.
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:20.600]   Well, here's a case.
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:22.600]   This is an interesting one.
[00:30:22.600 --> 00:30:28.600]   Lieutenant Governor Mark Taylor of Georgia.
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:31.600]   His bio was amended not inaccurately.
[00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:35.600]   It was just extended to include the fact that his son was arrested for drunk driving.
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:37.600]   Now that stuff was accurate.
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:43.600]   They're not denying the accuracy, but it was added because it looked made him look bad, right?
[00:30:43.600 --> 00:30:45.600]   What other reason could there be?
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:48.600]   I mean, if I'm digging up a bio on somebody, I'm not looking for their children.
[00:30:48.600 --> 00:30:51.600]   Am I mentioned that they have a child?
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:52.600]   But that's an interesting thought.
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:58.600]   If I've got somebody who's like, and I don't know anything about the person in particular
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:03.600]   we're talking about, but there have been political operatives that have made big honking.
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:07.600]   My family is superior because of my political and religious beliefs, and this is what I am
[00:31:07.600 --> 00:31:09.600]   standing my campaign on.
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:15.600]   And if it turns out that their own example, their children are ramping the maniacs.
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:16.600]   Precisely.
[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:18.600]   I think that has a really tremendous bearing on it.
[00:31:18.600 --> 00:31:23.600]   As the information is factual, it should be belongs, right?
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:28.600]   His office said we feel it's out of bounds, but it's his biography.
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:31.600]   This also can be embarrassing and hurtful the way people do it.
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:32.600]   Of course.
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:36.600]   Yeah, and the only thing worse than having somebody send you particularly nasty emails
[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:40.600]   for somebody to post it publicly like that or to modify a wiki, I can only imagine what
[00:31:40.600 --> 00:31:45.600]   our wikis are going to look like in a week after people get through with this.
[00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:49.600]   You know, I guess the real theory is that it's self correcting, right?
[00:31:49.600 --> 00:31:56.600]   That others will come in and fix errors and that it somehow tends toward accuracy.
[00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:00.600]   Has that been your experience in Wikipedia though?
[00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:02.600]   Well, it depends on what you're talking about.
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:04.600]   I think a lot of articles it does.
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:11.600]   Is the system too big at this point for Wikipedia to have a set of vetted editors that check
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.600]   all changes before they go in?
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:15.600]   Well, they do have a system like that.
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:21.600]   They actually have a deputized group of people who will take responsibility for a certain category
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:22.600]   of inventory.
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:24.600]   The scope and size of that site is just huge.
[00:32:24.600 --> 00:32:25.600]   Yeah, you can't police it.
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:27.600]   Well, I mean, if I went in there and...
[00:32:27.600 --> 00:32:28.600]   Perfect.
[00:32:28.600 --> 00:32:32.600]   If I ran in there and edited that helium is lighter than hydrogen, someone would catch that.
[00:32:32.600 --> 00:32:33.600]   Someone would catch that.
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:35.600]   Someone would catch it within an hour.
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:36.600]   Yeah.
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:40.600]   On the other hand, the Segan Thaler, you know, bio, went for months and nobody picked it up,
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:43.600]   even though it was obviously blatantly ridiculous.
[00:32:43.600 --> 00:32:46.600]   So, now I'm almost saying that it shouldn't even make it to the point...
[00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:50.600]   If you click on like a definition for helium or hydrogen, it shouldn't have that misinformation
[00:32:50.600 --> 00:32:51.600]   on the top edge.
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:54.600]   That should be something somebody has to look at first before it's applied.
[00:32:54.600 --> 00:32:56.600]   And maybe it is that way right now.
[00:32:56.600 --> 00:33:00.600]   Should students be allowed to use Wikipedia as a resource?
[00:33:00.600 --> 00:33:02.600]   Some schools say it's...
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:03.600]   Sure.
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:04.600]   Some schools say it's plagiarism.
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:05.600]   You should be able to use it as a resource.
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:08.600]   You just better attribute what you do.
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:09.600]   Say it to a...
[00:33:09.600 --> 00:33:12.600]   Therefore, if it's wrong, at least you say it's Wikipedia's fault because that's how
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:13.600]   you footnoted it.
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.600]   Well, yeah, but I mean, there's a difference between...
[00:33:15.600 --> 00:33:17.600]   I mean, Leo, some schools think of it as plagiarism.
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:18.600]   Yeah.
[00:33:18.600 --> 00:33:19.600]   I was talking to...
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:20.600]   I was talking...
[00:33:20.600 --> 00:33:21.600]   I know it seems a lot.
[00:33:21.600 --> 00:33:23.600]   I was talking to a kid who's school.
[00:33:23.600 --> 00:33:25.600]   The rules are you cannot use Wikipedia.
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:27.600]   We'll be considered plagiarism if you do.
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:28.600]   Well, I think it's...
[00:33:28.600 --> 00:33:32.600]   Again, an example of somebody who doesn't understand technology, overreacting to it.
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:37.600]   Well, but also the context is I'm having seen a number of, you know, junior journalists
[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:39.600]   cutting-paste stuff from other places online.
[00:33:39.600 --> 00:33:43.600]   Yeah, but I mean, what's his school saying, "Don't cut and paste Wikipedia because it's
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:46.600]   plagiarism," or were they saying, "Because there's a...
[00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:49.600]   If they use even sighted of Wikipedia, we'll be considered..."
[00:33:49.600 --> 00:33:54.600]   In other words, I guess their feeling is because you don't know where the information in Wikipedia
[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:55.600]   came from.
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:56.600]   Well, this is...
[00:33:56.600 --> 00:33:57.600]   You're not talking about plagiarism.
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:58.600]   I don't know.
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:33:59.600]   I'm not sure.
[00:33:59.600 --> 00:34:01.600]   That's talking about using Wikipedia as a fact checker.
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:02.600]   It's not.
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:03.600]   That would be ignorant of a school's part.
[00:34:03.600 --> 00:34:04.600]   That's fact checking not plagiarism.
[00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:06.600]   To make a blanket roll like that.
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:09.600]   Because there's lots of books that can plagiarize.
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:10.600]   True.
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:16.600]   Because, look, if a student uses misinformation within Wikipedia, and that ends up in the
[00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:19.600]   paper, and the teacher reads that and they know, "Okay, well, you know what, this is clearly
[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:20.600]   wrong."
[00:34:20.600 --> 00:34:21.600]   And it'll know where you got...
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:22.600]   It doesn't even matter where you got the information from.
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:23.600]   It's just...
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:25.600]   It's bad information, and it's going to reflect on your final score.
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:28.600]   That's true, because, I mean, if you're writing a paper, and you say with the atomic...
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:32.600]   I mean, going back to the molecular stuff, if you say the atomic number of hydrogen is
[00:34:32.600 --> 00:34:37.600]   x, you should be able to check a reliable source.
[00:34:37.600 --> 00:34:40.600]   So it depends on if it's a reliable source, not a plagiarism.
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:45.600]   That's just one of the things that some of the librarians groups do is they collect
[00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:48.600]   vetted online sources for information.
[00:34:48.600 --> 00:34:51.600]   And it's kind of interesting to watch that process as they go through and try to
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:54.600]   figure out what's reliable and what isn't online.
[00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:58.600]   And now that we know that nothing is reliable, I mean, how do you judge?
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:34:59.600]   Well, it's all so...
[00:34:59.600 --> 00:35:02.600]   So, you mean, you start to look back, you look back at some of the...
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:06.600]   It's always kind of fun to look at older, you know, non-fiction books.
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:10.600]   And you kind of think like, "Wow, this was published, and this was relied upon."
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:13.600]   And you just start snickering to yourself, you know?
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:16.600]   Well, yeah, there'd be monsters, right?
[00:35:16.600 --> 00:35:21.600]   That's like the great Woody Allen movie, "Sleep-Per-Where," you know, they start telling him all the stuff that was wrong.
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:22.600]   You know, like the best...
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:24.600]   The healthiest food is chocolate.
[00:35:24.600 --> 00:35:25.600]   And...
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:30.600]   That's good for you.
[00:35:30.600 --> 00:35:33.600]   Of course, that's comedy.
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:35.600]   And we can laugh at it, and we can laugh at it.
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:40.600]   Hey, you know, the leading agents in medicine used to bleed people.
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:42.600]   That's true. In fact, they're all back to it.
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:45.600]   I keep a vial of leeches around just a case.
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:46.600]   No, they've gone back to leeches.
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:49.600]   They're using leeches now, that's right.
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:51.600]   But not for colds, they're not as...
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:54.600]   Not a leech is in Silicon Valley too, which makes you very usable.
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:56.600]   A little tiny...
[00:35:56.600 --> 00:35:57.600]   A little tiny, you know...
[00:35:57.600 --> 00:36:02.600]   A Chinese business man has bought a MiG-21F plane on eBay.
[00:36:02.600 --> 00:36:03.600]   And lucky dog.
[00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:05.600]   For 24,000, a good deal.
[00:36:05.600 --> 00:36:06.600]   Holy bargain.
[00:36:06.600 --> 00:36:07.600]   Cow!
[00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:08.600]   Well, it must be empty.
[00:36:08.600 --> 00:36:11.600]   He says he's going to use it to decorate an empty space at his offices.
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:15.600]   However, according to...
[00:36:15.600 --> 00:36:19.600]   I guess this was the USA today, nobody's talked yet to Chinese customs.
[00:36:19.600 --> 00:36:22.600]   It's about whether he'll be able to get it in.
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:25.600]   That guy's probably doesn't have to talk to any customs official.
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:26.600]   Yeah, one would think.
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:30.600]   There's a number of Chinese businessmen that's pretty much above the laws at work.
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:31.600]   That's right.
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:32.600]   Apparently...
[00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:35.600]   You'd think he'd be able to get one in country then.
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:39.600]   Apparently, there's a Chinese company once bought a retired aircraft carrier.
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:41.600]   And they go to business or something?
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:42.600]   Yeah, I was able to get it in.
[00:36:42.600 --> 00:36:49.600]   It was a Soviet-era Minsk-class aircraft carrier that converted it into a floating theme park.
[00:36:49.600 --> 00:36:50.600]   Wow.
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:51.600]   Yeah, the company went bankrupt.
[00:36:51.600 --> 00:36:54.600]   The ship is for sale, Robert.
[00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:56.600]   I don't need a aircraft carrier.
[00:36:56.600 --> 00:36:58.600]   I could use a submarine.
[00:36:58.600 --> 00:36:59.600]   Maybe we should do that Paul Allen.
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:00.600]   Go to Yachtworld.com.
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:07.600]   There used to be a bunch of D-class commissioned Russian submarines on Yachtworld.com, which I always thought was great.
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:12.600]   You know, 600,000 of retired submarines.
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:17.600]   Did anybody ever during the tech TV or a Git on Paul Allen's boat or his submarine?
[00:37:17.600 --> 00:37:19.600]   John, do you ever get invited to any of that stuff?
[00:37:19.600 --> 00:37:20.600]   No, I don't think anybody likes to.
[00:37:20.600 --> 00:37:22.600]   I don't think anybody likes me anymore.
[00:37:22.600 --> 00:37:26.600]   Now, Greg Dreben, our former fearless leader, went to Fluteu Moscow.
[00:37:26.600 --> 00:37:28.600]   I think I heard about that party.
[00:37:28.600 --> 00:37:33.600]   With a couple of other tech TV execs for a Paul Allen party in Moscow.
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:35.600]   Yeah, he does his yearly parties.
[00:37:35.600 --> 00:37:38.600]   And his boat, he actually has three yachts.
[00:37:38.600 --> 00:37:42.600]   The second biggest in the world, the fourth biggest in the world.
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:44.600]   I think the thirteenth biggest in the world.
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:47.600]   I don't know what you need more than one of these things for.
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:49.600]   Because you have size issues?
[00:37:49.600 --> 00:37:51.600]   Nina, the pinter, and the Santa Maria.
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:52.600]   That's the amazing thing.
[00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:56.600]   You must have been looking at the same yacht list that I was looking at that had like three of them
[00:37:56.600 --> 00:38:02.600]   belonged to Saudi princes and two of them belonged to Paul Allen and of the top yachts.
[00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:06.600]   Yeah, there's a number of lists, but the Paul Hacks has three.
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:13.600]   I happen to be rewriting a blog thing on the fact that on these yachts, because in Oakland,
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:16.600]   you know, for these yachts cost $200, $300 million or more.
[00:38:16.600 --> 00:38:20.600]   And in Oakland, the old President Roosevelt's old Potomac.
[00:38:20.600 --> 00:38:22.600]   Oh, that's beautiful.
[00:38:22.600 --> 00:38:26.600]   Website, www Potomac.org.
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:29.600]   I think it's maybe USS Potomac.org.
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:32.600]   It's, anyways, you can go visit the thing in Oakland.
[00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:33.600]   It was rebuilt.
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:36.600]   It was sold for like $15,000 junk.
[00:38:36.600 --> 00:38:38.600]   And then nobody bought it.
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:41.600]   There was an auction and Oakland Port bought it for this low amount of money.
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:43.600]   And then they dropped $5 million into it.
[00:38:43.600 --> 00:38:45.600]   Now the things that, you know, works.
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:51.600]   Meanwhile, there's these guys, you're like the biggest yacht right now, supposedly motorboat
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:56.600]   is Larry Ellison's new boat, the Maltese Falcon.
[00:38:56.600 --> 00:39:00.600]   And this thing is just a unbelievable monster.
[00:39:00.600 --> 00:39:06.600]   And it's, I don't, you know, meanwhile, I think it must cost $300, $400 million for this thing.
[00:39:06.600 --> 00:39:11.600]   And by the way, the rule of thumb is, you can tell I've been reading too much about this stuff,
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:16.600]   but the rule of thumb is that whatever the price of the boat is, if it's like $500 million,
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:21.600]   it's 10% of that per year for maintenance.
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:22.600]   So, that's incredible.
[00:39:22.600 --> 00:39:23.600]   That's incredible.
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:25.600]   You have to have a 40 million a year.
[00:39:25.600 --> 00:39:26.600]   Sure.
[00:39:26.600 --> 00:39:30.600]   When, and Paul Allen apparently has a recording studio with a studio musician sitting waiting
[00:39:30.600 --> 00:39:33.600]   for him in the hall of the boat at all times.
[00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:34.600]   Yeah, Larry's got that beat.
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:36.600]   He's got a full basketball court in his.
[00:39:36.600 --> 00:39:40.600]   Yeah, but does he have Kareem Abdul-Jabbar waiting for him at all times?
[00:39:40.600 --> 00:39:41.600]   Possibly.
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:45.600]   And Michael Lewis is a book, the new new thing he talks about Jim Clark, who also has a
[00:39:45.600 --> 00:39:46.600]   yacht fetish.
[00:39:46.600 --> 00:39:51.600]   In fact, was in a competition with Larry Ellison to have the tallest yacht.
[00:39:51.600 --> 00:39:53.600]   And Clark had one with the highest mast.
[00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:55.600]   And I think Ellison beat his by a foot or two.
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:57.600]   And now Clark is building a new one.
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:59.600]   I mean, this is one of the fully automated systems.
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:00.600]   Actually, I think.
[00:40:00.600 --> 00:40:01.600]   Allen, they're.
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:04.600]   Allen's big boat is a stink pot.
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:05.600]   It's not a sailboat.
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:06.600]   Oh, okay.
[00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:08.600]   So, Jim Clark is a sailboat.
[00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:09.600]   But he's get.
[00:40:09.600 --> 00:40:10.600]   And it's apparently the biggest.
[00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:11.600]   It's 300-something feet.
[00:40:11.600 --> 00:40:12.600]   It's so tall.
[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:14.600]   It can't fit under the Golden Gate Bridge.
[00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:16.600]   Well, it does on low tide, as opposed to it can.
[00:40:16.600 --> 00:40:21.280]   I think around the turn of the 19th, you know, beginning of the 20th century that everybody
[00:40:21.280 --> 00:40:24.600]   looked around and talked about, lifted and shamrock in the Americas.
[00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:25.600]   Oh, we're right there.
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:26.600]   Some people are right there.
[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:29.600]   Yeah, you know, being like, you know, what's this guy doing?
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:32.600]   This is the Astor's and the Vanderbilts all over again.
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:38.080]   I mean, I'm surprised they don't have Newport, Rhode Island style mansions on the, I guess
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:39.080]   they do.
[00:40:39.080 --> 00:40:41.680]   Hey, does Greg Norman do something besides play golf?
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:45.120]   Because he has a boat that just blows me away.
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:47.520]   He had it built, I think, a year or two ago.
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:48.520]   He probably had $70 million craft.
[00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:50.000]   He probably was an endorsement.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   That just shows you how much money there's.
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   It's a lot of golf accessories.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   It's enormous.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:57.880]   I mean, I don't know how long the actual boat is, but he has like a 42 foot custom boat
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:02.800]   that can be dropped off the main boat for fishing and like another 30 foot boat, a 22
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:05.440]   foot boat, two 18 footers and a rescue boat.
[00:41:05.440 --> 00:41:09.040]   Did you get his standard once you get over the 100 200 foot level?
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:10.240]   It was outrageous though.
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:13.800]   Now you've got to read about Paul Allen's 400 something foot boat.
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:15.200]   Four times bigger.
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:17.240]   It's got an eight man submarine on it.
[00:41:17.240 --> 00:41:19.040]   Oh, you're talking about the octopus.
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:20.040]   Two helicopters.
[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:21.040]   Yeah, the octopus.
[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:25.320]   Yeah, Greg, Greg, Greg, Devin told me the reason Paul Allen's told him that he built
[00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:29.240]   the submarine is that when he goes scuba diving, he doesn't like to splash into the
[00:41:29.240 --> 00:41:30.240]   water.
[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:31.800]   He likes to emerge into the water.
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:36.960]   Okay, I looked it up the submarine has the capacity to sleep eight for up to two weeks
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:38.480]   under water.
[00:41:38.480 --> 00:41:39.480]   What in hell?
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:41.760]   That's a getaway, man.
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:46.680]   When Paul Allen liked tech TV the most, I mean, he had one, you know, all the billionaires
[00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:53.640]   like to compete in the sailboat racing and he actually protected TV is the main sponsor.
[00:41:53.640 --> 00:41:55.640]   All the Americans got on the sail.
[00:41:55.640 --> 00:41:57.760]   I think that was so we could write off.
[00:41:57.760 --> 00:42:00.640]   I think that was so we could write off the donation to the Americans.
[00:42:00.640 --> 00:42:03.800]   And that was a really good use of the money for promoting tech TV.
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:04.800]   Yeah, really.
[00:42:04.800 --> 00:42:08.440]   It's all those people that are into those devices where tech TV viewers weren't they?
[00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:09.840]   There was a little debate.
[00:42:09.840 --> 00:42:14.720]   They were considering actually buying a NASCAR endorsement, which probably would have been
[00:42:14.720 --> 00:42:15.720]   a lot better.
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:17.760]   A lot more expensive too.
[00:42:17.760 --> 00:42:19.800]   No, NASCAR endorsements are expensive.
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:20.800]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:42:20.800 --> 00:42:22.320]   A couple milli here.
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:25.920]   More than well, yeah, a couple milli here for like a bumper sticker on the ass.
[00:42:25.920 --> 00:42:28.160]   That's the badge on the guy's headrest.
[00:42:28.160 --> 00:42:30.240]   Now you want to have this side of the vehicle.
[00:42:30.240 --> 00:42:32.440]   I'm still recovering from Talladega this week.
[00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:34.800]   Why can't what happened to Talladega?
[00:42:34.800 --> 00:42:36.200]   Oh, it's just a good race.
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:37.200]   That's where NASCAR was this week.
[00:42:37.200 --> 00:42:38.200]   Were you there?
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:39.200]   No, no, no.
[00:42:39.200 --> 00:42:42.880]   Are you just the fastest track though in the world as far as I know the why cover to NASCAR
[00:42:42.880 --> 00:42:43.880]   fan.
[00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:47.280]   I can't these billionaires be competing on the best tech channel that they could build.
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:50.000]   Why can't there be some, you know, boasting points in that?
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.240]   I wouldn't I wouldn't get them ramped up on this Leo because I'm pretty sure they can
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:55.440]   find prettier, smarter people than us.
[00:42:55.440 --> 00:42:56.440]   Oh, good.
[00:42:56.440 --> 00:42:57.440]   That's wrong.
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:58.440]   It's wrong.
[00:42:58.440 --> 00:42:59.920]   They let loose the funding.
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:01.920]   I think we're out of jobs.
[00:43:01.920 --> 00:43:05.160]   Keep them out of this course power hydrogen Corvette.
[00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:06.160]   That's what I want.
[00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:07.160]   Hydrogen powered Corvette.
[00:43:07.160 --> 00:43:09.160]   He's still back in Talladega, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:10.160]   Turn him off.
[00:43:10.160 --> 00:43:13.640]   It's like the fact that the latest model Corvettes have like 400 horsepower engines
[00:43:13.640 --> 00:43:15.360]   and 30 miles to the gallon.
[00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:16.360]   Yep.
[00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:17.360]   500.
[00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:18.840]   500, that's awesome.
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:23.600]   But does it still get like 30 plus miles to the gallon highway?
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:24.600]   Who knows?
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:26.480]   It seems unlikely.
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:33.160]   Somewhere the latest trend in viruses, Trojan ransom dash A, once run on your computer,
[00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:39.440]   freezes the system and threatens to delete files every 30 minutes until you pay $10.99
[00:43:39.440 --> 00:43:41.440]   to the virus author.
[00:43:41.440 --> 00:43:42.440]   Aha.
[00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:45.080]   This is done through Western Union.
[00:43:45.080 --> 00:43:49.440]   I think the executives of Western Union should be taken and arrested.
[00:43:49.440 --> 00:43:50.440]   No kidding.
[00:43:50.440 --> 00:43:51.640]   Well, they have to find some business.
[00:43:51.640 --> 00:43:55.520]   You know, the last telegram was sent about a month or two ago.
[00:43:55.520 --> 00:43:57.240]   The very last Western Union teller.
[00:43:57.240 --> 00:43:58.240]   Really?
[00:43:58.240 --> 00:43:59.240]   Yeah.
[00:43:59.240 --> 00:44:00.240]   Telegrams are gone.
[00:44:00.240 --> 00:44:01.240]   They're gone.
[00:44:01.240 --> 00:44:02.240]   Yeah, they've been gone for a while.
[00:44:02.240 --> 00:44:03.240]   Not that long.
[00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:04.240]   The last one was just a few months ago.
[00:44:04.240 --> 00:44:05.240]   Boy.
[00:44:05.240 --> 00:44:07.040]   And they never told anybody they were going to do this so you couldn't even do a souvenir
[00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:08.040]   telegram.
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:09.040]   It was unbelievable.
[00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:10.040]   Yeah.
[00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:12.560]   There are actually been, this is the third ransom Trojan.
[00:44:12.560 --> 00:44:16.720]   There was another one called CryZip and then ZipOA, which saw payments of 300 bucks.
[00:44:16.720 --> 00:44:19.320]   But I guess this guy's figuring out he'll make it up in volume, right?
[00:44:19.320 --> 00:44:20.320]   So $10.99.
[00:44:20.320 --> 00:44:28.880]   And then you get a by return telegraph or whatever, you get the, after you pay the ransom to
[00:44:28.880 --> 00:44:34.120]   the Western Union, you get a CIDN number, which allows you to unlock it.
[00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:35.120]   You know what?
[00:44:35.120 --> 00:44:37.920]   You're never going to get the, this is just like the eBay scams that run through Western
[00:44:37.920 --> 00:44:38.920]   Union.
[00:44:38.920 --> 00:44:44.680]   You pay Western Union, they cash the Western Union grand and you never hear or see from
[00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:45.680]   them again.
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:46.680]   Yeah.
[00:44:46.680 --> 00:44:49.840]   There's just, there's no, I think it's kind of funny actually.
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:51.000]   Given the ransom demands.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   I love the $10.99.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   It's like marketing geniuses.
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   One million, yeah.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   Why 99 cents?
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   What an $11.
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:02.200]   It's a cheap, it's a good deal.
[00:45:02.200 --> 00:45:03.200]   They won't notice.
[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:08.080]   Or there's some, there's some, you know, legal reason.
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:12.360]   If it's below a certain amount, maybe it doesn't become a, maybe $11 is the cut off
[00:45:12.360 --> 00:45:13.360]   point.
[00:45:13.360 --> 00:45:15.000]   That would be really funny actually.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:19.040]   You know, when does the, when does the secret service in the postal?
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:22.920]   The post office get involved with wire fraud.
[00:45:22.920 --> 00:45:25.040]   See, Google's got a better deal.
[00:45:25.040 --> 00:45:29.800]   According to an article in the Seattle Times, Google's making a ton of money.
[00:45:29.800 --> 00:45:33.840]   And I think it's obvious from these type of sites, you know, when you mistype URL and
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:38.440]   you get a, a, just a list of ads, basically Google ads.
[00:45:38.440 --> 00:45:39.760]   Who clicks on the ads there though?
[00:45:39.760 --> 00:45:42.600]   Do they own that generic page that always seems to pop up?
[00:45:42.600 --> 00:45:44.240]   Well, like, no, you know what?
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:46.840]   Internet service providers are starting to do that.
[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:47.840]   Yeah.
[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:49.080]   And SP probably owns that.
[00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:52.320]   If you get a standard page, it's not the Microsoft, you know, the one that you get a
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:55.320]   normally Internet Explorer that says you must have typed a wrong address.
[00:45:55.320 --> 00:45:57.040]   Your Internet service providers doing that.
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:46:00.480]   Remember, Varysign wanted to do that and started to do that.
[00:46:00.480 --> 00:46:03.200]   That was just so obnoxious when Varysign did that.
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:04.760]   And now ISPs are doing it.
[00:46:04.760 --> 00:46:09.440]   Would there be a way to prevent those extraneous sites from popping up by using a host list
[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:11.040]   on the Windows PC or something like that?
[00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:12.040]   Yeah, I think there would be.
[00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:13.040]   Yeah.
[00:46:13.040 --> 00:46:14.040]   That's a good idea.
[00:46:14.040 --> 00:46:15.040]   It's just annoying.
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:19.480]   Don't automatically search or anything or don't try to guess what I agree.
[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:21.840]   If I type in the wrong thing, give me a 404 or just say that.
[00:46:21.840 --> 00:46:22.840]   Give me a 404.
[00:46:22.840 --> 00:46:26.040]   I did not resolve message and I'll figure out what I did.
[00:46:26.040 --> 00:46:27.040]   But, ah.
[00:46:27.040 --> 00:46:30.560]   There's a company called CEDO, SEDO, which is a quote parking service.
[00:46:30.560 --> 00:46:37.200]   They have more than one million unused addresses, all of which are on the Google ad network.
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:38.640]   And they're rationale as well.
[00:46:38.640 --> 00:46:41.760]   We want these pages to function as alternatives to search engines.
[00:46:41.760 --> 00:46:46.440]   So when you mistype, well, we'll tell you what you really were looking for.
[00:46:46.440 --> 00:46:47.440]   Well, they're click farming.
[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:51.480]   But I mean, that was one of the things that came out of Web 2.0 is one of the best things
[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:52.480]   I heard there.
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:56.080]   Somebody's pointing out, you know, you can pay, there's like a certain type of cancer
[00:46:56.080 --> 00:47:03.040]   that is the number one or the highest per dollar or per dollar value.
[00:47:03.040 --> 00:47:07.000]   It's like $40 per click, per click on Google.
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.520]   And what the guy says, well, a lot of people have figured out is doing misspellings.
[00:47:10.520 --> 00:47:15.080]   You can do similar things, do the common misspellings, and for like one tenth the cost of maybe
[00:47:15.080 --> 00:47:16.880]   the proper term.
[00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:19.680]   You can get all the people who can't spell it but are still searching for it.
[00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:20.680]   Sure.
[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:21.680]   C-A-N-C-I-R dot com.
[00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:27.240]   You know, just buy that and put some links up there and you make a bunch of money.
[00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:28.240]   Melanuma dot com.
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:29.240]   Melanuma dot com.
[00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:31.720]   Again, more hits on your site than that we'll ever get.
[00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:32.720]   I don't know.
[00:47:32.720 --> 00:47:34.720]   You're not making a bunch of money.
[00:47:34.720 --> 00:47:36.200]   You don't think?
[00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:40.800]   I guess we won't really know unless Google tells us and I doubt Google would say a word
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:41.800]   about it.
[00:47:41.800 --> 00:47:45.440]   Well, they lose it on sales, John, but they make it up in volume.
[00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:46.800]   Yeah, I just mistyped.
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:49.680]   I mistyped lodgetech.com right now.
[00:47:49.680 --> 00:47:56.840]   I transposed the T and the I and it at googlesindication.com.
[00:47:56.840 --> 00:47:57.840]   Is that an actual Google?
[00:47:57.840 --> 00:47:58.840]   Oh, that's interesting.
[00:47:58.840 --> 00:48:04.280]   Here are some web related websites for lodget.
[00:48:04.280 --> 00:48:05.280]   How did you spell it?
[00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:06.360]   Let me try it on my--
[00:48:06.360 --> 00:48:11.120]   L-O-G-T-I-E-C-H dot com.
[00:48:11.120 --> 00:48:12.760]   Let me see what I get.
[00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:15.440]   But all the ads linked to something called Google authentication.
[00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:18.760]   Firefox prevented this site from opening a pop-up window and you're right.
[00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:23.800]   I get here are some related sites for lodgetech.com and these are all Google ads.
[00:48:23.800 --> 00:48:24.800]   You bet.
[00:48:24.800 --> 00:48:27.800]   Well, I just went to cancer dot com.
[00:48:27.800 --> 00:48:28.880]   There's a bunch of cancer stuff.
[00:48:28.880 --> 00:48:29.880]   C-A-N-C-I-R.
[00:48:29.880 --> 00:48:30.880]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:31.880]   So that's who these people are.
[00:48:31.880 --> 00:48:34.280]   How are you spelling lodgetech again?
[00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:36.800]   L-O-G-T-I-E-C-H dot com.
[00:48:36.800 --> 00:48:37.800]   Just transposing lodgetech.
[00:48:37.800 --> 00:48:40.800]   L-O-G-T-I-E-C-H.
[00:48:40.800 --> 00:48:48.280]   And I'm going to do a-- let me just do really quickly who is on this-- who owns this domain.
[00:48:48.280 --> 00:48:51.960]   It's owned by a company in Tortola.
[00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:54.080]   It's just domain and Rekater.
[00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:55.080]   In the Virgin Islands?
[00:48:55.080 --> 00:48:56.080]   Yeah.
[00:48:56.080 --> 00:48:57.080]   Yeah, it's owned by--
[00:48:57.080 --> 00:48:58.080]   Domain card.
[00:48:58.080 --> 00:48:59.080]   Domain card.
[00:48:59.080 --> 00:49:00.080]   Domain card.
[00:49:00.080 --> 00:49:06.560]   A Peugeot-- C-O Peugeot marketing in Tortola the Virgin Islands.
[00:49:06.560 --> 00:49:07.560]   Mm.
[00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:09.040]   No income tax.
[00:49:09.040 --> 00:49:12.160]   You can tell me they're not making money, John, but I think somebody's making some
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:13.160]   money on this.
[00:49:13.160 --> 00:49:14.160]   Oh, they're making--
[00:49:14.160 --> 00:49:15.160]   Hey, they have every right to.
[00:49:15.160 --> 00:49:16.160]   Wait a minute.
[00:49:16.160 --> 00:49:17.160]   They make me have every right to.
[00:49:17.160 --> 00:49:18.160]   Let me click this link.
[00:49:18.160 --> 00:49:19.160]   Oh.
[00:49:19.160 --> 00:49:22.000]   This is-- I can't see anybody going to this and going, oh, duh.
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.000]   Okay.
[00:49:23.000 --> 00:49:25.080]   Let me click here, oh boy, a camera.
[00:49:25.080 --> 00:49:26.080]   No, absolutely.
[00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:27.080]   Oh, come on, John.
[00:49:27.080 --> 00:49:28.080]   You don't think so?
[00:49:28.080 --> 00:49:29.080]   Absolutely.
[00:49:29.080 --> 00:49:32.780]   That's why they have every right to, if there's people that think okay, oh, I can't
[00:49:32.780 --> 00:49:34.120]   write camera, then fine.
[00:49:34.120 --> 00:49:35.120]   So you missed type--
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:37.080]   Or even worse, the sponsor links are going to go over here.
[00:49:37.080 --> 00:49:39.600]   Logitech, click smart, and then they'll get what?
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:40.600]   Two cents from Shop--
[00:49:40.600 --> 00:49:45.600]   There's got to be a reason why all those Viagra ads get sent out in spam.
[00:49:45.600 --> 00:49:48.560]   Well, of course, you don't get spam, John, so you wouldn't know about that.
[00:49:48.560 --> 00:49:52.160]   That's the problem, John's not in touch with the real world.
[00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:53.160]   So this is interesting.
[00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:58.600]   If you type C-A-N-C-I-R.com, you get the quote "cancer information center" with a lot of
[00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:01.600]   links, a lot of paid links, right?
[00:50:01.600 --> 00:50:02.600]   And it's very nicely done.
[00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:04.280]   I mean, they've got pictures of doctors and stuff.
[00:50:04.280 --> 00:50:10.240]   So if you got here by accident thinking you typed cancer.com, you might think this is
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:13.200]   a legitimate collection of links.
[00:50:13.200 --> 00:50:15.680]   But what if it maybe is a legitimate?
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:23.120]   Maybe it may suit you might go to cancer.com and think, "Oh, I'll tell you why.
[00:50:23.120 --> 00:50:24.120]   It's not legitimate."
[00:50:24.120 --> 00:50:25.120]   Because also at the bottom--
[00:50:25.120 --> 00:50:29.360]   Also at the bottom of the page is an offer to buy the domain name.
[00:50:29.360 --> 00:50:30.560]   I saw that too.
[00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:32.840]   Yeah, that's how much money they're making.
[00:50:32.840 --> 00:50:36.440]   God, will somebody buy this for how much it's such a loser?
[00:50:36.440 --> 00:50:42.360]   Yeah, but if you have like-- I mean, what I've noticed is a lot of-- through ISPs collapsing
[00:50:42.360 --> 00:50:46.480]   and through people just skimming URLs, people have ended up with a lot of URLs, the rights
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:49.280]   to a lot of URLs for apps next to nothing.
[00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:51.240]   They farm them out like this.
[00:50:51.240 --> 00:50:58.240]   Well, cyber squatting has been around since the day the internet-- since the day the web
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:50:59.240]   started.
[00:50:59.240 --> 00:51:02.200]   I'd like to know how much Google makes off of this.
[00:51:02.200 --> 00:51:04.120]   Because indirectly they benefit from it too, right?
[00:51:04.120 --> 00:51:06.040]   I mean, if they're serving up all of the ads.
[00:51:06.040 --> 00:51:07.200]   That's right.
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:08.440]   Or Yahoo or whoever.
[00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:11.360]   But that's kind of interesting.
[00:51:11.360 --> 00:51:17.360]   30million.com domain names registered last month, 30 million.
[00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:20.720]   Yeah, but wasn't that because of the land rush for the.eu?
[00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:23.920]   No, these are .com names.
[00:51:23.920 --> 00:51:25.320]   I don't know if maybe they are.
[00:51:25.320 --> 00:51:26.520]   No, I find that hard.
[00:51:26.520 --> 00:51:30.240]   Not more than 90% were dropped, as according to GoDaddy.
[00:51:30.240 --> 00:51:35.920]   Currently, there are 54 million active .com and .net addresses, according to Veracine.
[00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:37.120]   There's how many?
[00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:38.120]   54 million.
[00:51:38.120 --> 00:51:40.640]   Well, then I ended 30 million and it all came in last month.
[00:51:40.640 --> 00:51:41.640]   It doesn't sound--
[00:51:41.640 --> 00:51:45.040]   Well, how many-- there's the difference between how many are active and how many possible
[00:51:45.040 --> 00:51:46.280]   combinations you have.
[00:51:46.280 --> 00:51:47.760]   They were registered and dropped.
[00:51:47.760 --> 00:51:48.760]   Most of those are dropped.
[00:51:48.760 --> 00:51:50.440]   Oh, here's the deal.
[00:51:50.440 --> 00:51:51.440]   I get it.
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:52.440]   Okay.
[00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:56.840]   Purchasers can change your mind within five days and avoid paying the registration fee.
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:51:59.560]   So what people do is they get it for five days.
[00:51:59.560 --> 00:52:01.600]   They quickly create Google ads on it.
[00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:03.280]   They see if it is a valuable--
[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:05.000]   Oh, no, that's smart.
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:06.000]   That's good.
[00:52:06.000 --> 00:52:07.400]   See if it's a valuable typo.
[00:52:07.400 --> 00:52:08.400]   I like that.
[00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:10.200]   So they're worth-- that's what's going on.
[00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:15.880]   There were 30 million registered last month, but only 3 million were kept after five days
[00:52:15.880 --> 00:52:17.440]   because the rest were garbage.
[00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:19.000]   There's probably a bot that does that.
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   You can just crank it up.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:24.040]   Yeah, but five days isn't long enough to get enough of a presence on the search engines.
[00:52:24.040 --> 00:52:25.760]   Well, you usually hit any of these.
[00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:27.920]   You don't need any of the search engines for typos.
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:28.920]   It's typos.
[00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:29.920]   It's not search engines.
[00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:30.920]   It's typos.
[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:32.720]   People like me just try to get too quick.
[00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:33.720]   And you, of course--
[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:34.720]   And you, of course--
[00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:35.220]   Google's got--
[00:52:35.220 --> 00:52:39.400]   Google's got-- goggle.com, Google with 2Os, Google with 3Os, Google with 4Os, and Google
[00:52:39.400 --> 00:52:40.400]   with 5Os.
[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:41.400]   Which makes sense given that--
[00:52:41.400 --> 00:52:42.400]   All it's given that.
[00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:45.720]   But don't you remember when all like the-- there used to be all those like misspelled sites
[00:52:45.720 --> 00:52:47.360]   that were like one letter off.
[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:49.840]   You'd find yourself at a porn site.
[00:52:49.840 --> 00:52:51.120]   Well now it's not porn anymore.
[00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:53.000]   It's people who just think I'll make a little bit of money.
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:54.640]   Or maybe these were porn sites.
[00:52:54.640 --> 00:52:57.000]   They do the same thing to popular porn sites, too.
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   Actually, that's a really good point.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.080]   They'll be misspelled by one letter and go to some competitor's site.
[00:53:01.080 --> 00:53:02.080]   You're right.
[00:53:02.080 --> 00:53:03.080]   It used to be porn sites.
[00:53:03.080 --> 00:53:06.000]   And you see the porn stuff wasn't working out there as well as these-- these--
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   both sites.
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:08.000]   That's interesting.
[00:53:08.000 --> 00:53:14.840]   Well, what about that-- there was that story last week where there was a piracy organization
[00:53:14.840 --> 00:53:18.240]   that basically set up a dummy NEC corporation where they were in the fielding--
[00:53:18.240 --> 00:53:19.240]   Yeah, awesome.
[00:53:19.240 --> 00:53:22.840]   --they were even fielding service calls for products in NEC--
[00:53:22.840 --> 00:53:23.840]   They were--
[00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:25.880]   They were commissioning research.
[00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:30.280]   They basically set up an entire dummy corporation in China that was emulated, basically stole
[00:53:30.280 --> 00:53:33.040]   the NEC logo, the NEC name set up.
[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:35.880]   Like basically set up an entire false front company.
[00:53:35.880 --> 00:53:37.520]   And what did they-- and how did they make money?
[00:53:37.520 --> 00:53:38.520]   What was the scale?
[00:53:38.520 --> 00:53:40.520]   What was their revenue model?
[00:53:40.520 --> 00:53:46.360]   They were selling-- basically, they-- the revenue model was they were selling products
[00:53:46.360 --> 00:53:48.040]   pretending to be NEC.
[00:53:48.040 --> 00:53:51.360]   They basically set up a completely legitimate business except they stole somebody else's
[00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:52.360]   brand and trademark.
[00:53:52.360 --> 00:53:53.360]   Huh.
[00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:55.440]   And supposedly the products weren't that bad.
[00:53:55.440 --> 00:53:58.720]   Yeah, there would be a lot of cases that they basically--
[00:53:58.720 --> 00:53:59.720]   Those crazy Chinese.
[00:53:59.720 --> 00:54:00.720]   Chinese.
[00:54:00.720 --> 00:54:01.720]   This is why--
[00:54:01.720 --> 00:54:05.800]   This is why trademark and copyright law is meaningless unless every country adheres
[00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:06.800]   to it.
[00:54:06.800 --> 00:54:10.480]   Speaking of China, do you remember last week we had the story about the Chinese--
[00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:14.080]   Chinese dissident that was given up by Yahoo email?
[00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:15.080]   Yeah.
[00:54:15.080 --> 00:54:18.320]   And apparently there's a story going around now that--
[00:54:18.320 --> 00:54:24.240]   Of course, a Yahoo spokesperson, Mary Osaka, saying that Yahoo was completely unaware of
[00:54:24.240 --> 00:54:25.240]   this case.
[00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:26.480]   Oh, interesting.
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:30.360]   And that they didn't-- that they didn't turn over any information.
[00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:34.040]   So maybe whose suspect is this reporter's without borders, which is the human rights
[00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:35.480]   organization that's reporting this.
[00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:38.200]   And I was very careful to say that they're only alleging it.
[00:54:38.200 --> 00:54:42.160]   I mean, there's no evidence except for from this group that this happened.
[00:54:42.160 --> 00:54:43.560]   Well, I think Yahoo--
[00:54:43.560 --> 00:54:44.560]   What is Yahoo doing?
[00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:47.480]   This is supposed to be some great direct research engine company.
[00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:50.360]   And it took them that long to get to this story about them.
[00:54:50.360 --> 00:54:51.360]   I think it--
[00:54:51.360 --> 00:54:54.240]   It took them a week to admit.
[00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:55.240]   Maybe they listened to Twitter.
[00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:56.240]   It just took them a long time to get around.
[00:54:56.240 --> 00:54:57.240]   I know.
[00:54:57.240 --> 00:54:58.240]   Somebody's throwing--
[00:54:58.240 --> 00:54:59.240]   It came out--
[00:54:59.240 --> 00:55:00.240]   --rock through it.
[00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:01.240]   And it's 28.
[00:55:01.240 --> 00:55:02.240]   So--
[00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:03.240]   It's like somebody throwing rocks through your windows.
[00:55:03.240 --> 00:55:04.240]   It takes you a week to figure it out.
[00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:05.240]   A little later they--
[00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:06.240]   It's rock's doing in the living room.
[00:55:06.240 --> 00:55:10.320]   Yeah, but Yahoo's got like 42 million windows on seven continents.
[00:55:10.320 --> 00:55:12.960]   It might take a while to notice there's a draft, John.
[00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:17.400]   Well, the story is actually up again because now there's another fourth Chinese dissident
[00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:21.160]   is now been sentenced to 10 years in prison.
[00:55:21.160 --> 00:55:26.480]   And the same group reporters without borders say that it was, in fact, Yahoo that provided
[00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:28.720]   the information that helps jail the dissident.
[00:55:28.720 --> 00:55:33.640]   And of course, these are on charges that the Chinese government says are incitement
[00:55:33.640 --> 00:55:37.800]   to subvert state power, which is a crime in the country of--
[00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:45.640]   He had set up a Yahoo group called AAABBBCCC and was using that, I guess, to put--
[00:55:45.640 --> 00:55:49.280]   I don't know-- to subvert, to get together and subvert.
[00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:50.280]   Yeah, the--
[00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:54.920]   I wish somebody would create a page that just keeps track of everyone who's been put in
[00:55:54.920 --> 00:55:55.920]   prisoner, you know.
[00:55:55.920 --> 00:55:57.920]   Well, man, this is what we talked about last year.
[00:55:57.920 --> 00:55:59.480]   You just give us a status page.
[00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:04.000]   The Yahoo spokesman and-- well, the spokeswoman in Hong Kong said the company requires strictly
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:08.600]   little documentation before complying with any official request for information, but we
[00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:12.680]   do cooperate with the laws of every country in which we operate.
[00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:14.400]   Of course they do.
[00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:17.520]   Do you think the Chinese government actually has the tools they would need to just do this
[00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:19.320]   themselves without Yahoo's intervention?
[00:56:19.320 --> 00:56:20.520]   Well, it's the same thing as the RIA.
[00:56:20.520 --> 00:56:21.520]   That's the RIA.
[00:56:21.520 --> 00:56:23.120]   They just go to Yahoo and say, "Well, look, we got the IP address.
[00:56:23.120 --> 00:56:28.080]   We see this guy doing it, but we need to know what his home address is."
[00:56:28.080 --> 00:56:29.080]   And Yahoo knows, I guess.
[00:56:29.080 --> 00:56:30.080]   Well, you're right.
[00:56:30.080 --> 00:56:33.480]   I would think that isn't China the ISP, really?
[00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:35.960]   You would think that they would just simply do all that stuff.
[00:56:35.960 --> 00:56:38.160]   You give us those tools if you want to do business here.
[00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:39.520]   Yeah, that's probably true.
[00:56:39.520 --> 00:56:40.520]   We don't have to ask you.
[00:56:40.520 --> 00:56:41.520]   You don't have to ask.
[00:56:41.520 --> 00:56:42.520]   You're right.
[00:56:42.520 --> 00:56:43.520]   They don't have to ask.
[00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:44.520]   Scary as that sounds.
[00:56:44.520 --> 00:56:46.320]   Steve Jobs says he's not going to run Disney.
[00:56:46.320 --> 00:56:47.480]   Sorry, John.
[00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:50.600]   I think he should run Disney.
[00:56:50.600 --> 00:56:51.840]   Don't you think it'd be great?
[00:56:51.840 --> 00:56:53.720]   I mean, I'm not a big fan of Steve Jobs.
[00:56:53.720 --> 00:56:58.000]   I think everybody realizes that, but I think he'd make a great Disney CEO because of the
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:56:59.000]   designer.
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   He'd do better than I would.
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:06.480]   He probably looks at it, realizes it would be like trying to steer Disney's probably
[00:57:06.480 --> 00:57:09.560]   like trying to park a super freighter in a tiny harbor.
[00:57:09.560 --> 00:57:11.520]   Just no maneuverability, no flexibility.
[00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:13.680]   That would be a nightmare group to run.
[00:57:13.680 --> 00:57:18.200]   Apple had its shareholders meeting this week on Thursday.
[00:57:18.200 --> 00:57:20.600]   And one of the shareholders said, "Well, what's the dealer?
[00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:22.200]   You're going to go run Disney?"
[00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:23.200]   He said, "No."
[00:57:23.200 --> 00:57:26.560]   He said, "I barely have time to run Apple.
[00:57:26.560 --> 00:57:32.520]   In fact, it's going to give me more time because I was the chief executive officer of both Pixar
[00:57:32.520 --> 00:57:37.520]   and Apple and now I'm just CEO of Apple and the board member of Disney."
[00:57:37.520 --> 00:57:40.880]   So what you got to do with Apple is you going to pick colors for the next iPod?
[00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:42.520]   Hey, that's very important, John.
[00:57:42.520 --> 00:57:47.160]   I don't think you should diminish that.
[00:57:47.160 --> 00:57:48.160]   For a million.
[00:57:48.160 --> 00:57:50.360]   Somebody's got to do it.
[00:57:50.360 --> 00:57:54.240]   Since Steve's been on watch at Apple, he's pretty much completely turned around the company.
[00:57:54.240 --> 00:57:55.240]   You can't complain about what's...
[00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:58.280]   ...the entirely additional business model on top of computing sales.
[00:57:58.280 --> 00:58:01.280]   Maybe he's going to turn him back into a computer-centric company again.
[00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:03.160]   So the iPod is an accessory.
[00:58:03.160 --> 00:58:04.760]   He's going to sell Windows.
[00:58:04.760 --> 00:58:06.360]   Come on, John knows that.
[00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:07.360]   Squeak toys.
[00:58:07.360 --> 00:58:08.360]   That's squeak toys.
[00:58:08.360 --> 00:58:09.360]   Squeak toys.
[00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:10.360]   Squeak toys back.
[00:58:10.360 --> 00:58:12.360]   It's actually a little pick sucker.
[00:58:12.360 --> 00:58:16.400]   It was late year squeak toy that did that.
[00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:18.360]   Well my screen just went dark, so I can't...
[00:58:18.360 --> 00:58:19.360]   I don't know what happened here.
[00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:21.600]   I can no longer tell you what news is.
[00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:24.280]   But we pretty much used up our time allotment anyway for this.
[00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:25.480]   There's not a lot of news to this.
[00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:26.560]   It was a light week.
[00:58:26.560 --> 00:58:27.560]   It really wasn't.
[00:58:27.560 --> 00:58:28.560]   I mean we managed to move it for every...
[00:58:28.560 --> 00:58:29.560]   Was that an E3?
[00:58:29.560 --> 00:58:30.560]   An E3.
[00:58:30.560 --> 00:58:32.560]   Hey, Apple announces this 17-inch...
[00:58:32.560 --> 00:58:33.560]   You weren't an A.B.
[00:58:33.560 --> 00:58:35.520]   Anything else you saw about that?
[00:58:35.520 --> 00:58:38.400]   We have this week in media, they talked all about the red camera.
[00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:40.400]   Any thoughts on the Oakley red camera?
[00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:41.400]   I think the...
[00:58:41.400 --> 00:58:43.120]   Well I got to talk to a couple of the guys.
[00:58:43.120 --> 00:58:45.840]   One of the guys that works with the internal team and one of the guys who's going to be
[00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:47.240]   a dealer for red.
[00:58:47.240 --> 00:58:49.680]   And it was really interesting to...
[00:58:49.680 --> 00:58:52.320]   It was really interesting to talk to them because essentially what they're trying to do
[00:58:52.320 --> 00:59:00.320]   is $100, $150, $200,000 camera for $17, $5, $47, $95 for the lens.
[00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:03.360]   And you'll still need some kind of capture device for it.
[00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:05.200]   Or some sort of storage device for it.
[00:59:05.200 --> 00:59:09.120]   But a DLTV going to start shooting in a super-high D?
[00:59:09.120 --> 00:59:11.600]   Not to be fair to switch it.
[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:15.080]   Which may actually be coming from another group later on.
[00:59:15.080 --> 00:59:16.080]   That's a very good point.
[00:59:16.080 --> 00:59:18.920]   This would be good for making a movie but not for doing a TV show.
[00:59:18.920 --> 00:59:20.520]   Well it might be good.
[00:59:20.520 --> 00:59:21.520]   It brings...
[00:59:21.520 --> 00:59:22.520]   If they can...
[00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:24.520]   If one, if they can make it ship, right?
[00:59:24.520 --> 00:59:30.640]   If they ship and it works and it delivers the quality they're claiming, you're basically
[00:59:30.640 --> 00:59:36.400]   talking about undercutting every major digital professional camera manufacturer by like order.
[00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:38.960]   Literally almost in order of magnitude.
[00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:41.440]   Which is insane when you look at it.
[00:59:41.440 --> 00:59:45.520]   It's like depending on how you're pricing it, it's one fifth or one tenth of the cost.
[00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:47.400]   You can use interchangeable lenses.
[00:59:47.400 --> 00:59:48.400]   It's got...
[00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:52.840]   Of course, if they had one and if they don't think they had any functioning ones on the
[00:59:52.840 --> 00:59:56.080]   show floor, they may have had some they were demoing.
[00:59:56.080 --> 01:00:00.520]   So what do we know about the so-called Mysterium?
[01:00:00.520 --> 01:00:02.320]   Which always seems like a dubious name.
[01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:04.160]   That's a bad name for a cerium.
[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:05.320]   I know it's here.
[01:00:05.320 --> 01:00:08.600]   You've got to understand this is traditional Oakley marketing.
[01:00:08.600 --> 01:00:11.360]   These are the guys who invented unobtainium for sunglasses.
[01:00:11.360 --> 01:00:12.360]   Oh really?
[01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:13.360]   That's funny.
[01:00:13.360 --> 01:00:16.520]   This is part of the Oakley marketing tradition and they are extending that into this new
[01:00:16.520 --> 01:00:17.520]   area.
[01:00:17.520 --> 01:00:23.400]   They have always done goofy names for the materials they come up with for their lenses
[01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:25.400]   and their frames and their liking.
[01:00:25.400 --> 01:00:26.400]   I like unobtainium.
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:27.400]   I've got a couple of meetings.
[01:00:27.400 --> 01:00:30.040]   I've got a meeting with Kodak and I can talk to the people with Fovian and I'll find
[01:00:30.040 --> 01:00:31.040]   out what this is really about.
[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:32.040]   See what the mysterious and real thing is.
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:34.320]   The Fovian guys have really shaken up the world.
[01:00:34.320 --> 01:00:35.320]   You know that's sad.
[01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:36.840]   What the hell happened there?
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:38.480]   The Fovian was such a great idea.
[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:39.480]   The military got a hold of it.
[01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:40.480]   It's still a great idea.
[01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:41.480]   Oh, is the military using it?
[01:00:41.480 --> 01:00:45.320]   That's what I just assume any time a piece of good technology just vanishes from the consumer
[01:00:45.320 --> 01:00:46.320]   side of things.
[01:00:46.320 --> 01:00:51.080]   The military had something that was really good about it and it vanished.
[01:00:51.080 --> 01:00:52.560]   Then we get it 20 years later.
[01:00:52.560 --> 01:00:53.560]   Yeah, that might be cool.
[01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:54.560]   But there was a lot of cool.
[01:00:54.560 --> 01:00:56.600]   NAB had a lot of cool consumer stuff though too.
[01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:57.600]   NAB was insane.
[01:00:57.600 --> 01:00:59.440]   I'm sorry I missed that one.
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:00.440]   What else?
[01:01:00.440 --> 01:01:01.440]   Tell us some more.
[01:01:01.440 --> 01:01:04.600]   Okay, well one I realized from looking around at NAB that if you have a large enough potential
[01:01:04.600 --> 01:01:09.960]   market all standards can become successful because you started to look around and you
[01:01:09.960 --> 01:01:15.680]   realized there's like 19 competing IPTV formats that are destined for everything from online
[01:01:15.680 --> 01:01:21.400]   distribution of video the way we do it for our shows or IPTV in the sense of wiring
[01:01:21.400 --> 01:01:24.120]   up a college campus or a motel for video.
[01:01:24.120 --> 01:01:28.200]   But don't you think there'll be a shake out in one or two standards will format, so we'll
[01:01:28.200 --> 01:01:29.920]   survive or you think they'll all exist?
[01:01:29.920 --> 01:01:34.520]   I think there's at this point it'll be interesting to see whether or not any one particular
[01:01:34.520 --> 01:01:36.560]   standard becomes prominent.
[01:01:36.560 --> 01:01:42.680]   If you look in terms of there's so many different systems for localized video distribution
[01:01:42.680 --> 01:01:46.480]   and they all seem to have a market whether it's for hotels or motels.
[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:50.400]   If you get one good chain of hotels that might be enough to keep your company going
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:52.040]   if you have a small company.
[01:01:52.040 --> 01:02:00.280]   It's interesting to look at new techs like the Tri-Castor Pro was big for us because
[01:02:00.280 --> 01:02:04.560]   they've added a bunch of features into that that we've been clamoring for and we'll get
[01:02:04.560 --> 01:02:06.160]   our hands on one of those in a couple of weeks.
[01:02:06.160 --> 01:02:12.040]   It was interesting to look at, listen to the chairman of the FCC talk who was basically,
[01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:16.360]   I'm not going to address whether or not there's going to be more consolidation and ownership
[01:02:16.360 --> 01:02:21.200]   and the terrestrial radio versus satellite radio.
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:25.080]   Since they're distributing local content on the satellite network and not the terrestrial
[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:27.840]   network, they're within the terms of their agreement.
[01:02:27.840 --> 01:02:31.880]   It was kind of funny to watch because there's just so much going on in so many different
[01:02:31.880 --> 01:02:34.720]   directions and there seems to be a market for all of it.
[01:02:34.720 --> 01:02:35.720]   That was the thing.
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:37.720]   Media explosion.
[01:02:37.720 --> 01:02:38.720]   Yeah.
[01:02:38.720 --> 01:02:39.720]   That's great.
[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:43.600]   Who's going to have time to watch all this stuff?
[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:46.320]   Well, that's why you've got to use this stuff.
[01:02:46.320 --> 01:02:49.080]   I mean, I wasn't there.
[01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:51.720]   I didn't see how many different standards there were.
[01:02:51.720 --> 01:02:56.720]   The people that have ideas have only so much are really using them.
[01:02:56.720 --> 01:03:00.880]   If someone has something that's being used by people, then even if it's not as good as
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:04.760]   someone else's, the one that's being used is the one that's going to be adopted.
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:09.480]   But if you look at a lot of the tools that are out there, let's say rendering out video
[01:03:09.480 --> 01:03:14.160]   in multiple formats, there's a lot of high dollar tools now that are along with the standards
[01:03:14.160 --> 01:03:22.120]   you expect like WMB and MPEG-4 and 8.264, MPEG-4 and stuff like that are also doing things
[01:03:22.120 --> 01:03:28.520]   like, you think like Flash, WMB and some variations on QuickTime would be pretty normal.
[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:32.120]   Maybe an 8.264, MPEG-4, but they're also doing Divx.
[01:03:32.120 --> 01:03:34.280]   They're also doing more obscure formats.
[01:03:34.280 --> 01:03:38.360]   They're not quite pushing out into the open source formats yet, but a lot of them actually
[01:03:38.360 --> 01:03:41.720]   have the ability to, if you want to render out in 19 different formats, they'll render
[01:03:41.720 --> 01:03:44.760]   out in 19 different formats.
[01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:49.040]   That's just because nobody's come up with a, nobody's dominant yet.
[01:03:49.040 --> 01:03:55.400]   And I think consumers want to, I get a lot of questions from consumers, what format should
[01:03:55.400 --> 01:03:56.400]   I use?
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:04:00.720]   They don't like this tower of Babel of formats.
[01:04:00.720 --> 01:04:03.760]   Except for the ones who absolutely positively, I need Divx.
[01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:05.760]   It's all about Divx, Divx is the best ever.
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:06.760]   It's like, well I use WMB.
[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:07.760]   Everybody has their thing.
[01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:08.760]   Right.
[01:04:08.760 --> 01:04:12.600]   You know, where you look at the fact that WMB doesn't work as well on, you know, Macs as
[01:04:12.600 --> 01:04:13.920]   it does on PCs.
[01:04:13.920 --> 01:04:19.760]   I look at what Rocket Boom is doing with H.264 and you know, MPEG-4 and I just think it looks
[01:04:19.760 --> 01:04:24.160]   fantastic and it's really, you know, they're doing good looking video.
[01:04:24.160 --> 01:04:25.160]   Yeah.
[01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:28.000]   And they're shooting it with, you know, they're shooting and editing it.
[01:04:28.000 --> 01:04:32.520]   They're spending about, I understand, four to eight hours in preparation for a video.
[01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:36.120]   Okay, they're producers up, you know, three or four in the morning working on this thing.
[01:04:36.120 --> 01:04:37.120]   Yeah.
[01:04:37.120 --> 01:04:40.280]   I wonder if anyone, how they're getting their bandwidth paid for because they keep telling
[01:04:40.280 --> 01:04:43.640]   people that they have no, there's no bandwidth costs, there's no distribution costs.
[01:04:43.640 --> 01:04:45.400]   Well, that's obviously not true.
[01:04:45.400 --> 01:04:51.520]   They claim 350,000 downloads a day of their 20 megabyte file do the math.
[01:04:51.520 --> 01:04:53.080]   I mean, it's outrageous.
[01:04:53.080 --> 01:04:56.960]   I wonder if that's, you know, because it's another thing they do is they launch the video
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:57.960]   as soon as you open the book.
[01:04:57.960 --> 01:04:58.960]   Yeah.
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:00.600]   I think that's 350,000 hits to their front page.
[01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:03.880]   Do they distribute it in one format?
[01:05:03.880 --> 01:05:05.640]   They make it available in multiple formats.
[01:05:05.640 --> 01:05:06.640]   Okay.
[01:05:06.640 --> 01:05:08.160]   Because that's one of the things that we do it.
[01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:11.880]   Most people are seeing the front page video, which you get to go to rocketboom.com.
[01:05:11.880 --> 01:05:12.880]   Yeah.
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:16.400]   I mean, I know that one of the things that we do at Revision 3, and it's only because
[01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:20.440]   they everyone wants to make formats, is we try to provide as many formats as possible.
[01:05:20.440 --> 01:05:23.240]   You know, I mean, remember when Twit first came out, there was always the person in the
[01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:26.120]   corner screaming, "Og Vorbis, Og Vorbis."
[01:05:26.120 --> 01:05:27.120]   Right.
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:32.120]   Well, we still get the Vorbis.
[01:05:32.120 --> 01:05:33.120]   Well, Og Vorbis.
[01:05:33.120 --> 01:05:34.120]   The one you're looking at.
[01:05:34.120 --> 01:05:35.120]   The one you're looking at.
[01:05:35.120 --> 01:05:36.120]   The one you're looking at.
[01:05:36.120 --> 01:05:37.120]   The one you're looking at.
[01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:38.120]   The open source format with no royalties for our Vorbis.
[01:05:38.120 --> 01:05:39.120]   I love Og Vorbis.
[01:05:39.120 --> 01:05:40.120]   Isn't there a video version of Og?
[01:05:40.120 --> 01:05:41.120]   The Ora?
[01:05:41.120 --> 01:05:44.600]   There's also, there's XVid in the Ora, kind of like two main alternate codecs.
[01:05:44.600 --> 01:05:49.920]   You know, but we stop doing XVid at DLTBE because we had so many problems getting the
[01:05:49.920 --> 01:05:51.120]   tools to function.
[01:05:51.120 --> 01:05:52.640]   When you say XVid, do you...
[01:05:52.640 --> 01:05:54.840]   I'm breaking on a regular basis.
[01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:59.440]   Do you mean XVid as opposed to Divx or do you consider them the same thing?
[01:05:59.440 --> 01:06:00.440]   No, same.
[01:06:00.440 --> 01:06:01.440]   It's totally different.
[01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:02.440]   Yeah.
[01:06:02.440 --> 01:06:04.440]   XVid is an open source thing out of Germany, if I'm not sure.
[01:06:04.440 --> 01:06:07.400]   Well, yeah, but isn't it an open source version of Divx?
[01:06:07.400 --> 01:06:09.160]   For all intensive purposes, yes.
[01:06:09.160 --> 01:06:10.160]   Yeah, it is.
[01:06:10.160 --> 01:06:11.160]   Although, I'll see you.
[01:06:11.160 --> 01:06:12.160]   So you would choose one or the other.
[01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:13.160]   You wouldn't do both.
[01:06:13.160 --> 01:06:17.960]   Well, we have people who consider Divx superior to Exyn, we have people who consider it a
[01:06:17.960 --> 01:06:18.960]   whole proprietary nature.
[01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:19.960]   You can't win.
[01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:20.960]   You can't win.
[01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:23.440]   You know, and then there's still the Theoragai's yelling in the corner.
[01:06:23.440 --> 01:06:29.480]   And it's like, hey, when we get tools that allow us to consistently produce this, not
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:33.360]   even automate, just produce it without crashing, we'll be happy.
[01:06:33.360 --> 01:06:38.080]   Patrick, did you say that you guys don't distribute an XVid version of DLTV anymore?
[01:06:38.080 --> 01:06:41.680]   Yeah, we dumped it for Divx.
[01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:42.680]   Wow.
[01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:49.520]   Because at least as far as I know, our latest numbers for, say, a video version of Ignatian
[01:06:49.520 --> 01:06:54.800]   our higher, our highest quality XVid is the most downloaded video that we have.
[01:06:54.800 --> 01:06:59.160]   We've never actually had more than when we were doing XVid regularly, I don't think we
[01:06:59.160 --> 01:07:02.560]   ever had more than 2000 people download XVid.
[01:07:02.560 --> 01:07:07.880]   And we've got a couple orders of magnitude past that on, on Divx.
[01:07:07.880 --> 01:07:11.000]   And that's still not even close to being our most popular Kodak.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:14.000]   Our most popular Kodak is, is the iPod video.
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:15.800]   It's just through iTunes, follow the mic.
[01:07:15.800 --> 01:07:18.280]   And that's because that's what people subscribe to on iTunes.
[01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:20.840]   It's because iTunes dominates, absolutely.
[01:07:20.840 --> 01:07:21.840]   Well, yeah.
[01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:26.000]   And it does not just say that it has a heavy, in our case, in our audience, it has a heavy
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.480]   share, but it does not dominate.
[01:07:27.480 --> 01:07:32.320]   We actually have people who subscribe to the H.264 video through iTunes.
[01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:36.080]   But you know, people in some cases, from what I've heard, a lot of people do it through
[01:07:36.080 --> 01:07:40.400]   iTunes, just because iTunes, it's a little simpler or a little easier to find people
[01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:43.800]   than democracy or fire ants.
[01:07:43.800 --> 01:07:45.000]   Well, that's why they dominate.
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:48.920]   I mean, that's my point is that consumers are baffled by all this.
[01:07:48.920 --> 01:07:54.880]   Well, if you're looking at something like DLTV or, or, or, or, or, or, or, or some of
[01:07:54.880 --> 01:07:58.760]   these other tech shows that have video on iTunes, I think, I think their number, their
[01:07:58.760 --> 01:08:04.600]   percentage of those numbers that are, are not going to be as high for their, for the
[01:08:04.600 --> 01:08:09.600]   video that's provided through iTunes, as would a show say like, like, um,
[01:08:09.600 --> 01:08:14.600]   Tiki Baskin Ninja or Tiki Bar, because those are the ones that are quite frankly more mainstream.
[01:08:14.600 --> 01:08:16.520]   And that's what iTunes caters do more.
[01:08:16.520 --> 01:08:22.720]   But I mean, the DLTV audience is more mainstream than the Diviks are then, then the, uh, then
[01:08:22.720 --> 01:08:24.960]   the Ignatian audience is bizarre.
[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:29.120]   Maybe a little bit, but like I'm, I'm, I'm, if you're carrying in by the Codex, uh, yeah.
[01:08:29.120 --> 01:08:33.520]   Well, no, I'm comparing it to, you know, I'm comparing it to Tiki Bar.
[01:08:33.520 --> 01:08:34.520]   Right.
[01:08:34.520 --> 01:08:36.920]   And then if you look, but if you look at like overall, it'd be interesting to see like
[01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:41.440]   what percentage of, you know, it also depends on whether you talk about like, you know,
[01:08:41.440 --> 01:08:46.720]   commercially hosted, you know, video and websites versus bit torrent versus, you know, you know,
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:51.320]   legal movie downloads, like the legal movie downloads are all tied up in WMV.
[01:08:51.320 --> 01:08:54.840]   Most of the sites that do distribution, whether you're talking about YouTube or Google or
[01:08:54.840 --> 01:09:00.080]   insert name of, you know, major media company here are flash based, which is flash is its
[01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:02.880]   own punishment I've discovered on a number of levels.
[01:09:02.880 --> 01:09:04.600]   When flash works, it's, it's astounding.
[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:07.520]   When flash doesn't work, it's, uh, it's complicated.
[01:09:07.520 --> 01:09:11.280]   Well, Patrick, why don't you use flash?
[01:09:11.280 --> 01:09:12.280]   We do use flash.
[01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:13.280]   On what?
[01:09:13.280 --> 01:09:15.440]   I don't think cranky geek.
[01:09:15.440 --> 01:09:16.840]   Does cranky geeks go on flash?
[01:09:16.840 --> 01:09:17.840]   I don't think so.
[01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:19.440]   You know, you need to go to your website once in a while.
[01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:23.120]   That's crankygeeks.com is the weekly show hosted by John C. Devorak.
[01:09:23.120 --> 01:09:24.120]   Really?
[01:09:24.120 --> 01:09:25.120]   Uh, that's it.
[01:09:25.120 --> 01:09:26.120]   Davis, yeah.
[01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:27.920]   I just spelled that K R A N K.
[01:09:27.920 --> 01:09:29.760]   C R A N K.
[01:09:29.760 --> 01:09:30.760]   Yeah.
[01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:32.760]   I know I own cranky with an IE.
[01:09:32.760 --> 01:09:33.760]   That's, that's my site.
[01:09:33.760 --> 01:09:34.760]   And I'll give you some pointers.
[01:09:34.760 --> 01:09:36.560]   Oh, you're making all the money.
[01:09:36.560 --> 01:09:37.560]   Yeah.
[01:09:37.560 --> 01:09:39.560]   That's called geeks with a Z.
[01:09:39.560 --> 01:09:43.120]   It's the one that's called the K R A N K.
[01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:44.120]   K R A N K.
[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:45.120]   Geeks.
[01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:48.200]   Uh, all right.
[01:09:48.200 --> 01:09:50.880]   I'm glad we're just doing audio for Twit to be honest with you.
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:51.880]   It's all gone away.
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:56.680]   Hey, have anyone mess with that, uh, a coder from ATI that uses the video card processor
[01:09:56.680 --> 01:09:57.680]   to encode it to beta?
[01:09:57.680 --> 01:09:59.760]   It's still in two six four, isn't it?
[01:09:59.760 --> 01:10:02.800]   It's listed on the driver download side now and I actually have some hardware in the lab
[01:10:02.800 --> 01:10:04.040]   to mess with it.
[01:10:04.040 --> 01:10:07.200]   For me, the link for that because it's, it's, some of the early testing looked really good
[01:10:07.200 --> 01:10:10.880]   on that, but they didn't have it for a number of the codecs we wanted to play with.
[01:10:10.880 --> 01:10:11.880]   Yeah.
[01:10:11.880 --> 01:10:12.880]   That's for encoding, not decoding.
[01:10:12.880 --> 01:10:14.480]   No, Patrick, I'm on the site now.
[01:10:14.480 --> 01:10:15.560]   I found it.
[01:10:15.560 --> 01:10:20.280]   So it's like W M V video, iPod H two 64, MPIC for audio only.
[01:10:20.280 --> 01:10:22.160]   I don't see the on the page.
[01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:23.640]   Look at the big, look at John.
[01:10:23.640 --> 01:10:27.600]   Look at the big giant picture of your face in the middle of cranky geeks.
[01:10:27.600 --> 01:10:28.600]   Oh, okay.
[01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:29.600]   So there's a big flash.
[01:10:29.600 --> 01:10:30.600]   Click here at the top of the paint.
[01:10:30.600 --> 01:10:31.600]   It says click your play.
[01:10:31.600 --> 01:10:34.600]   How about get it, get it, give it as some embedded code?
[01:10:34.600 --> 01:10:36.520]   What are you talking about?
[01:10:36.520 --> 01:10:37.520]   It is.
[01:10:37.520 --> 01:10:38.520]   He's clicked to start.
[01:10:38.520 --> 01:10:40.520]   Yeah, that's a place I can put it on my blog.
[01:10:40.520 --> 01:10:41.520]   You know what?
[01:10:41.520 --> 01:10:43.320]   We'll talk about that on Monday at all.
[01:10:43.320 --> 01:10:44.320]   Forward to the links.
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:45.320]   Have a meeting, guys.
[01:10:45.320 --> 01:10:46.320]   Why don't you have a meeting?
[01:10:46.320 --> 01:10:47.320]   No, I'm actually, I'm serious.
[01:10:47.320 --> 01:10:49.520]   You know, I can forward you to the link to that.
[01:10:49.520 --> 01:10:53.280]   Okay, I'm now zipping the lips.
[01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:54.280]   Zip.
[01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:57.240]   No, that's why I like flash because you can embed it in anything.
[01:10:57.240 --> 01:10:58.240]   Nobody needs a player.
[01:10:58.240 --> 01:10:59.240]   They don't need anything.
[01:10:59.240 --> 01:11:00.240]   They just look at it.
[01:11:00.240 --> 01:11:01.240]   There it is.
[01:11:01.240 --> 01:11:02.240]   Yeah, you do need a player.
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:04.040]   If you want a custom player, you have to have a custom player created.
[01:11:04.040 --> 01:11:05.880]   You know, the custom players occasionally get broken.
[01:11:05.880 --> 01:11:08.040]   No, no, I'm talking about consumers.
[01:11:08.040 --> 01:11:10.880]   You're so focused on your issues as a producer.
[01:11:10.880 --> 01:11:11.880]   Oh, no.
[01:11:11.880 --> 01:11:16.160]   But that was, what was amazing, somebody who was, who's consumed flash, you know, video
[01:11:16.160 --> 01:11:17.160]   forever.
[01:11:17.160 --> 01:11:20.600]   I mean, other than, you know, the quality issues, I've never had a problem with it.
[01:11:20.600 --> 01:11:24.360]   Until I became a producer and I realized what a nightmare I could be producing flash.
[01:11:24.360 --> 01:11:28.040]   Well, and flash aid is so, is even better from point of view of the consumer.
[01:11:28.040 --> 01:11:29.960]   I mean, it's just really a good way to watch video.
[01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:31.800]   I think it's the way to go, be honest with you.
[01:11:31.800 --> 01:11:34.880]   Well, if you want to embed it in a page, right, if you want to, you know, what if you want
[01:11:34.880 --> 01:11:38.880]   to watch it on your home theater system and you want to open up a browser and watch,
[01:11:38.880 --> 01:11:40.360]   you know, the stuff that's designed.
[01:11:40.360 --> 01:11:42.360]   How many people are watching D.O. and I'm curious.
[01:11:42.360 --> 01:11:45.120]   Yeah, you imagine somebody watching cranky geese on their home theater.
[01:11:45.120 --> 01:11:46.120]   How many people are watching?
[01:11:46.120 --> 01:11:47.120]   They probably have a heart attack.
[01:11:47.120 --> 01:11:48.120]   About 15 percent.
[01:11:48.120 --> 01:11:49.120]   Really?
[01:11:49.120 --> 01:11:50.120]   They're watching the LTV.
[01:11:50.120 --> 01:11:51.120]   They're watching the LTV.
[01:11:51.120 --> 01:11:52.120]   According to the surveys.
[01:11:52.120 --> 01:11:53.120]   On TV.
[01:11:53.120 --> 01:11:54.120]   Wow.
[01:11:54.120 --> 01:11:55.120]   On TV's on home theater system.
[01:11:55.120 --> 01:11:56.120]   You know who does that guy from hack five does?
[01:11:56.120 --> 01:11:57.120]   He's got this all set up.
[01:11:57.120 --> 01:11:59.520]   He's got, Darren's got it.
[01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:03.200]   So that it downloads automatically in the democracy player on his server.
[01:12:03.200 --> 01:12:04.560]   He can come into his house.
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:05.560]   He sits down.
[01:12:05.560 --> 01:12:09.760]   He's put, he's put a little web interface to the player on his trio.
[01:12:09.760 --> 01:12:13.200]   So he sits down, presses play on his trio, serves to the website, presses play on his
[01:12:13.200 --> 01:12:14.760]   tree, and then watches it on his big screen TV.
[01:12:14.760 --> 01:12:16.640]   And he does that with all his podcasts.
[01:12:16.640 --> 01:12:22.080]   But see, that's too geeky to keep the keys when, when Apple comes out with the air, not
[01:12:22.080 --> 01:12:24.080]   air tunes, but air video.
[01:12:24.080 --> 01:12:25.080]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:12:25.080 --> 01:12:27.280]   You download the crap and see it on your couch and just get it.
[01:12:27.280 --> 01:12:28.280]   Hold on.
[01:12:28.280 --> 01:12:31.120]   But there's already the spotlight stuff that's in place and people are actually, people
[01:12:31.120 --> 01:12:36.360]   are already integrating podcasts into the media center edition, or videos into the media
[01:12:36.360 --> 01:12:39.640]   center edition and setting them up to automatically downloads their.
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:40.640]   Whoa.
[01:12:40.640 --> 01:12:44.560]   Well shoot, you can use TV tonic, which is a Microsoft thing and watch it on your TV.
[01:12:44.560 --> 01:12:48.160]   You can use, you can use the Xbox 360 as long as you hack it the right way.
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:51.560]   You can use your old Xbox, Xbox and regular and watch podcasts on that too.
[01:12:51.560 --> 01:12:55.760]   David, David, don't, don't, don't say, don't say it's not mainstream and then talk to me
[01:12:55.760 --> 01:12:56.760]   about Xbox hacking.
[01:12:56.760 --> 01:12:58.800]   Yeah, but how many people watch it on Xbox?
[01:12:58.800 --> 01:12:59.800]   Yeah, no kidding.
[01:12:59.800 --> 01:13:05.440]   I'm saying it's all possible, but right now the average Joe can't watch TV on their couch
[01:13:05.440 --> 01:13:08.720]   and when they can, that's going to be a big frickin' deal.
[01:13:08.720 --> 01:13:09.720]   I agree.
[01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:10.720]   I mean, that's what I'm...
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:11.720]   Yeah, we need so many...
[01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:15.120]   And that's why Flash video is so great because you can go to the website and click play.
[01:13:15.120 --> 01:13:16.800]   Most places you can't do that.
[01:13:16.800 --> 01:13:17.800]   Right.
[01:13:17.800 --> 01:13:20.760]   Hey, is there a quality limit for Flash video right now?
[01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:24.400]   Because it seems like whenever I watch anything, be it YouTube or Google, it, it quality,
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:25.400]   frankly, socks.
[01:13:25.400 --> 01:13:26.400]   Well, that's the...
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:28.400]   The YouTube, but they have to admit to my end with.
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:29.400]   Yeah, they're downgrading it.
[01:13:29.400 --> 01:13:30.400]   You can make it look great.
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:31.400]   Well, they're downgrading Flash.
[01:13:31.400 --> 01:13:32.400]   I mean, they're basically...
[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:35.200]   I mean, they give you different sizes, but I swear it's the same bit rate and everything
[01:13:35.200 --> 01:13:36.640]   just stretched to bigger sizes.
[01:13:36.640 --> 01:13:38.640]   I think that's what Google's video is doing, absolutely.
[01:13:38.640 --> 01:13:40.120]   It just looks chunkier.
[01:13:40.120 --> 01:13:41.120]   Yeah.
[01:13:41.120 --> 01:13:45.120]   Supposedly, supposedly YouTube's going through something in the neighborhood of 200 terabytes
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:46.120]   a day.
[01:13:46.120 --> 01:13:47.120]   Yeah, we talked about that until you...
[01:13:47.120 --> 01:13:48.960]   You missed that part of it.
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:49.960]   Oh, sorry.
[01:13:49.960 --> 01:13:50.960]   No, that's okay.
[01:13:50.960 --> 01:13:52.960]   No, Leo was talking about a million dollars a month, did you say?
[01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:54.400]   A million dollars a month.
[01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:55.400]   God!
[01:13:55.400 --> 01:13:56.400]   These electrons are expensive.
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:57.400]   Hey, bits cost.
[01:13:57.400 --> 01:13:59.120]   BAM, with cost money.
[01:13:59.120 --> 01:14:04.080]   But I mean, David, to go back to what you said before, a lot of people are looking at democracy
[01:14:04.080 --> 01:14:08.040]   as... or fire at as being an easy way to automate the downloads.
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:10.440]   And a lot of people are doing it straight in the Media Center Edition.
[01:14:10.440 --> 01:14:12.880]   Media Center Edition, I think that's pretty mainstream.
[01:14:12.880 --> 01:14:13.880]   No, that's cool.
[01:14:13.880 --> 01:14:14.880]   That's cool.
[01:14:14.880 --> 01:14:15.880]   And you guys are talking about hacking at 360.
[01:14:15.880 --> 01:14:21.000]   You don't have to hack at 360 if you have a Microsoft Media Center Edition 2005 system
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:22.000]   on the same network.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:24.520]   They see each other.
[01:14:24.520 --> 01:14:25.520]   They announce each other to each other.
[01:14:25.520 --> 01:14:27.520]   It makes it really nice.
[01:14:27.520 --> 01:14:28.520]   Okay.
[01:14:28.520 --> 01:14:29.520]   All right.
[01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:32.240]   I'm probably going to cut all this out because I don't...
[01:14:32.240 --> 01:14:34.640]   Do you think it's real inside baseball or do you think people will really?
[01:14:34.640 --> 01:14:36.360]   Oh, I think, you know, some people will like it.
[01:14:36.360 --> 01:14:37.360]   All right, I'll leave it.
[01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:38.360]   I can keep it in, Leo.
[01:14:38.360 --> 01:14:39.360]   We're just running.
[01:14:39.360 --> 01:14:40.360]   I have to...
[01:14:40.360 --> 01:14:42.480]   They would have hung up by now anyway.
[01:14:42.480 --> 01:14:47.160]   I spent so long editing last one just to get it down to like an hour twenty because we
[01:14:47.160 --> 01:14:49.400]   went for like two hours last week.
[01:14:49.400 --> 01:14:50.560]   But this one, I won't edit.
[01:14:50.560 --> 01:14:55.240]   We'll just leave it the way it is and, you know, people can edit it with their stop button.
[01:14:55.240 --> 01:14:56.680]   And we can finish it for twenty.
[01:14:56.680 --> 01:14:59.440]   No darn, it's four twenty one.
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:00.440]   We're going to...
[01:15:00.440 --> 01:15:01.440]   420.
[01:15:01.440 --> 01:15:02.440]   But you see...
[01:15:02.440 --> 01:15:05.520]   People usually aren't shy about telling us when we should have edited stuff out.
[01:15:05.520 --> 01:15:06.520]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:07.520]   I was...
[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:10.680]   This is kind of unrelated, but speaking of 420, I can't remember what university is.
[01:15:10.680 --> 01:15:11.680]   I think it's UCLA.
[01:15:11.680 --> 01:15:18.880]   Some college posted a website with hundreds of pictures of kids smoking pot on 420 day.
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:20.440]   University of Colorado, Boulder.
[01:15:20.440 --> 01:15:21.440]   That's right.
[01:15:21.440 --> 01:15:24.400]   There's dozens of photos up there and like, you know, like a fifth of them have already
[01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:25.400]   been identified.
[01:15:25.400 --> 01:15:27.480]   It's like, man, you can tell who's pissed off their friends.
[01:15:27.480 --> 01:15:28.480]   Well, that's the thing.
[01:15:28.480 --> 01:15:30.600]   They're asking other students to say, well, who is this?
[01:15:30.600 --> 01:15:32.080]   So they can arrest these people.
[01:15:32.080 --> 01:15:33.080]   And it is.
[01:15:33.080 --> 01:15:34.080]   It's just...
[01:15:34.080 --> 01:15:35.080]   How do they know they're really smoking pot after that point?
[01:15:35.080 --> 01:15:36.080]   It's your Gestapo tactic.
[01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:37.080]   It's the...
[01:15:37.080 --> 01:15:39.960]   Well, fans, they're not excused for it.
[01:15:39.960 --> 01:15:42.600]   But they... what they did, right, is they found out whether we're going to gather on
[01:15:42.600 --> 01:15:44.080]   420 day.
[01:15:44.080 --> 01:15:45.320]   They closed it down.
[01:15:45.320 --> 01:15:50.400]   They put notices, basically they tied notices like every twenty feet to the fence surrounding
[01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:51.600]   the field.
[01:15:51.600 --> 01:15:53.160]   And they basically, what they've got them on, they're not even...
[01:15:53.160 --> 01:15:55.160]   I don't even think they're going after them for smoking.
[01:15:55.160 --> 01:15:57.760]   I think they're going after them for the best passing.
[01:15:57.760 --> 01:15:58.760]   Oh, interesting.
[01:15:58.760 --> 01:16:01.600]   Because they weren't... they were where they were told.
[01:16:01.600 --> 01:16:05.960]   It says, "Farenfield closed April 20th, noon to five.
[01:16:05.960 --> 01:16:08.520]   Video and photographic surveillance in use."
[01:16:08.520 --> 01:16:13.520]   So that you were warned, but that's the whole point of 420 is just kind of mass civil disobedience,
[01:16:13.520 --> 01:16:14.520]   right?
[01:16:14.520 --> 01:16:15.520]   150 rather damning photos.
[01:16:15.520 --> 01:16:17.520]   It looks like Nazi German.
[01:16:17.520 --> 01:16:18.520]   I got a blog just immediately.
[01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:19.960]   It's pure Gestapo.
[01:16:19.960 --> 01:16:21.360]   And they're paying 50 bucks.
[01:16:21.360 --> 01:16:22.360]   50 bucks.
[01:16:22.360 --> 01:16:23.360]   Hey, let me see if I can see anyone.
[01:16:23.360 --> 01:16:24.360]   Find your friends.
[01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:25.360]   50 bucks.
[01:16:25.360 --> 01:16:27.800]   Is it going to make society better for arresting these people?
[01:16:27.800 --> 01:16:28.800]   I don't think so.
[01:16:28.800 --> 01:16:30.840]   No, but you get 50 bucks floating around.
[01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:31.840]   Okay, fine.
[01:16:31.840 --> 01:16:32.840]   I'll go get them.
[01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:35.800]   I wonder how many of these people are turning themselves in for the 50 bucks in the time
[01:16:35.800 --> 01:16:36.800]   more dope.
[01:16:36.800 --> 01:16:37.800]   That's me.
[01:16:37.800 --> 01:16:39.280]   That's my bomb.
[01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:40.280]   That's my chillom.
[01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:41.280]   I recognize it.
[01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:42.280]   Good luck.
[01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:46.280]   The fact that this is posted on a .edu website is ridiculous.
[01:16:46.280 --> 01:16:48.760]   I think it's time to call it quits, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:53.720]   But I have to say, we've managed to make a lot of hay out of very little news.
[01:16:53.720 --> 01:16:58.400]   I want to thank our friends at AOL Radio for providing the bandwidth for this questionable
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:02.080]   podcast, AOL.com/podcasting.
[01:17:02.080 --> 01:17:04.200]   Thanks to all the people who really helped the show out.
[01:17:04.200 --> 01:17:06.440]   Our opening theme from Mark Blasko.
[01:17:06.440 --> 01:17:07.680]   I love the new opening theme.
[01:17:07.680 --> 01:17:08.960]   He's just rocking out on that one.
[01:17:08.960 --> 01:17:13.040]   Of course, Ashley Twitt, who does do in the Twitt every week on our show.
[01:17:13.040 --> 01:17:15.040]   Dorothy Yamamoto, who's feeling better.
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:16.040]   Thank you.
[01:17:16.040 --> 01:17:17.040]   She's out of the hospital.
[01:17:17.040 --> 01:17:18.040]   We wish you the best, Dorothy.
[01:17:18.040 --> 01:17:21.280]   She did our Twitt logo.
[01:17:21.280 --> 01:17:24.120]   The Twitt redesign is coming along very well with the site.
[01:17:24.120 --> 01:17:25.360]   We hope to have that up soon.
[01:17:25.360 --> 01:17:31.680]   Thanks to the folks at ArcType in Canada and Lullabot in the US who are working hard on
[01:17:31.680 --> 01:17:33.600]   that.
[01:17:33.600 --> 01:17:36.680]   The vorac.org/blog for John C. to vorac's blog.
[01:17:36.680 --> 01:17:41.440]   dl.tv is where you can find Robert Herron and Patrick Mardin.
[01:17:41.440 --> 01:17:46.240]   David Baker is a part of Revision 3, so they take some blame too at revision3.com.
[01:17:46.240 --> 01:17:49.040]   One of those big announcements coming any day now.
[01:17:49.040 --> 01:17:53.360]   Speaking of the whole 420 thing load, the broken man, the broken's being done.
[01:17:53.360 --> 01:17:55.040]   We've shot some of the broken already.
[01:17:55.040 --> 01:17:56.960]   Is it a special 420, the broken?
[01:17:56.960 --> 01:17:59.880]   No, it's not, but it's the broken, which is, you know.
[01:17:59.880 --> 01:18:02.600]   Gosh, that's the originator, the original.
[01:18:02.600 --> 01:18:03.600]   I know.
[01:18:03.600 --> 01:18:04.600]   The original.
[01:18:04.600 --> 01:18:05.600]   Wow.
[01:18:05.600 --> 01:18:06.600]   Who's in the broken this time?
[01:18:06.600 --> 01:18:07.600]   Is it Dan and Kevin?
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:08.600]   The same three.
[01:18:08.600 --> 01:18:10.400]   We got Dan, we got Kevin and Ramsey.
[01:18:10.400 --> 01:18:11.400]   That's great.
[01:18:11.400 --> 01:18:12.400]   Ramsey's back.
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:13.400]   Look for it in June.
[01:18:13.400 --> 01:18:14.400]   All right.
[01:18:14.400 --> 01:18:15.400]   Thanks everybody.
[01:18:15.400 --> 01:18:16.400]   This is it.
[01:18:16.400 --> 01:18:17.400]   This is the can.
[01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:17.400]   There's a hot
[01:18:17.400 --> 01:18:18.400]   screen cap from the show.
[01:18:18.400 --> 01:18:19.400]   She was number 145.
[01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:20.400]   I think she should be on the show.
[01:18:20.400 --> 01:18:21.400]   Oh, great.
[01:18:21.400 --> 01:18:22.400]   Now we're rating.
[01:18:22.400 --> 01:18:23.400]   Now we're rating women.
[01:18:23.400 --> 01:18:24.400]   Oh, gosh.
[01:18:24.400 --> 01:18:25.400]   We really, really saw.
[01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:26.400]   The filler is mentioned.
[01:18:26.400 --> 01:18:27.400]   Oh, shoot.
[01:18:27.400 --> 01:18:28.400]   145, I think.
[01:18:28.400 --> 01:18:29.400]   That's what we're doing.
[01:18:29.400 --> 01:18:30.400]   We're going to be doing.
[01:18:30.400 --> 01:18:31.400]   We're going to be doing this.
[01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:32.400]   We're going to be doing this.
[01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:33.400]   We're going to be doing this.
[01:18:33.400 --> 01:18:34.400]   We're going to be doing this.
[01:18:34.400 --> 01:18:35.400]   We're going to be doing this.
[01:18:35.400 --> 01:18:36.400]   We're going to be doing this.
[01:18:36.400 --> 01:18:37.400]   We're going to be doing this.
[01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:38.400]   We're going to be doing this.
[01:18:38.400 --> 01:18:39.400]   We're going to be doing this.
[01:18:39.400 --> 01:18:40.400]   We're going to be doing this.
[01:18:40.400 --> 01:18:47.400]   We're going to be doing this.
[01:18:47.400 --> 01:18:48.400]   Oh, shoot.
[01:18:48.400 --> 01:18:49.400]   145, I agree.
[01:18:49.400 --> 01:18:50.400]   She's not bad.
[01:18:50.400 --> 01:18:51.400]   I don't know.
[01:18:51.400 --> 01:18:52.400]   I don't know.
