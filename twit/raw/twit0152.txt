[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.520]   It's time for Twit episode 152 and a great gaming panel.
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.600]   Oh, yeah, don't tone out.
[00:01:06.600 --> 00:01:07.840]   There's lots to talk about, but we're
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.280]   going to start with a gaming because I've
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:11.240]   got three gamers on the line.
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:13.880]   Starting with Don Reisinger, who's been a regular on Twit.
[00:01:13.880 --> 00:01:17.320]   He is a CNET's digital home go-to guy and also
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.000]   a writer for ours, Technica and Mashable.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.120]   Hey, Don.
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:20.960]   Hey, Leo, how you doing?
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:21.480]   Good.
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:21.980]   Welcome back.
[00:01:21.980 --> 00:01:22.960]   Good to have you on.
[00:01:22.960 --> 00:01:24.200]   Thanks for having me.
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:28.400]   Veronica Belmont of Tekzilla fame is also here.
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:30.320]   It's always good to have you on Veronica.
[00:01:30.320 --> 00:01:31.520]   Thank you for having me.
[00:01:31.520 --> 00:01:34.160]   I thought I might scare you off right before the show on Twit
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:34.420]   Live.
[00:01:34.420 --> 00:01:36.840]   I did a special tribute to Veronica.
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:39.040]   And I played the Elvis Costello song
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:42.160]   and did a slide show of some memorable Veronica moments.
[00:01:42.160 --> 00:01:44.040]   It was so creepy.
[00:01:44.040 --> 00:01:45.600]   You have memorable Veronica moments?
[00:01:45.600 --> 00:01:46.480]   It wasn't mine.
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.880]   You know, I use this new search engine.
[00:01:47.880 --> 00:01:49.640]   Have you ever used SearchMe?
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.120]   No.
[00:01:50.120 --> 00:01:51.840]   Searchme.com.
[00:01:51.840 --> 00:01:52.400]   It's really--
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:52.760]   I have not heard that.
[00:01:52.760 --> 00:01:55.560]   It's very fun for ego searching.
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:56.320]   Search me.
[00:01:56.320 --> 00:01:57.240]   But you can try it now.
[00:01:57.240 --> 00:01:57.560]   Go ahead.
[00:01:57.560 --> 00:01:58.880]   You've got plenty of bandwidth.
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:01.040]   Searchme.com and just search for your name.
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.760]   Veronica Belmont or Veronica Belmont,
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:05.520]   you take your pick both will work.
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:08.000]   And then you can click video, web images.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:08.960]   And I click images.
[00:02:08.960 --> 00:02:12.520]   And there it is being a slide show, like ready made.
[00:02:12.520 --> 00:02:15.280]   I think you leot it.
[00:02:15.280 --> 00:02:16.440]   I think it's not working now.
[00:02:16.440 --> 00:02:17.200]   Is it down?
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.320]   I kind of remembered not to mention that you are out.
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:20.840]   I know you can't say things out loud.
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:22.720]   Gosh darn it.
[00:02:22.720 --> 00:02:28.680]   Mr. Andy Mann in the chatroom says, she's not vain like you, Leo.
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:31.200]   She'd never do that.
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:32.400]   Also here, really please.
[00:02:32.400 --> 00:02:33.840]   He's never been on Twitch before,
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:36.320]   but I'm very glad to get him on.
[00:02:36.320 --> 00:02:37.640]   Now, how do you want me to introduce you?
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:38.840]   Major Nelson?
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:40.400]   Well, that's my gamer tag, Leo.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:41.480]   Larry Herb is fine.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:42.920]   I mean, hopefully I will--
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:44.240]   actually, I'm over at SearchMe.
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:46.840]   Not right now, looking up at my Veronica photos.
[00:02:46.840 --> 00:02:48.080]   That's fine, isn't it?
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:49.680]   It's brilliant.
[00:02:49.680 --> 00:02:51.840]   But no, you can certainly call us my gamer tag major
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:53.360]   and also, but Larry Herb is just fine.
[00:02:53.360 --> 00:02:55.880]   I'm the director programming over there at Xbox Live.
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:58.240]   And of course, that's a great major Nelson podcast,
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:00.800]   the Gaming Podcast, Ultimate Gaming Podcast.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:03.760]   And is really a great guy to listen to if you want to get
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:08.640]   the inside scoop on what's going on in the Xbox gaming.
[00:03:08.640 --> 00:03:11.880]   And if you think about the threads that
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:16.240]   connects these three people, they're all gaming oriented.
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:20.160]   Don, I think he spends most of his time gaming.
[00:03:20.160 --> 00:03:21.720]   Try.
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.800]   Big gamer, Veronica too, of course.
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:27.800]   Miss rock band, if nothing else.
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:28.960]   Oh, yes, of course.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:31.040]   I actually bought rock band here for the studio,
[00:03:31.040 --> 00:03:33.160]   just hoping you'd play sometime you'd come up and play.
[00:03:33.160 --> 00:03:34.240]   We could-- And buy me over.
[00:03:34.240 --> 00:03:35.360]   I'm going to get Joe Co here.
[00:03:35.360 --> 00:03:36.200]   It'll be great.
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:37.600]   We'll do a--
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:39.640]   Merlin Mann, we'll do a reprise.
[00:03:39.640 --> 00:03:41.680]   You need to redeem yourself a little bit, I'm afraid.
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:42.720]   I've been practicing.
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:43.840]   You're right.
[00:03:43.840 --> 00:03:45.680]   I screwed it up.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:48.000]   And Major Nelson, of course, the Xbox expert.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.840]   And the reason that we're all here today
[00:03:49.840 --> 00:03:52.400]   is because the big gaming trade show, EAT--
[00:03:52.400 --> 00:03:54.520]   I don't even know if you can call it a trade show anymore.
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.080]   E3 was this past week.
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:03:59.560]   It had more of a big conference deal, actually.
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:03.080]   Was it a conference or just a lot of press conferences?
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.400]   Yeah, probably a little bit of both.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.320]   I mean, I did have some meetings,
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:07.680]   but you're absolutely right.
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:09.960]   It wasn't the spectacle that it was two years ago
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:11.240]   and beat before.
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:12.840]   It was like a tomb.
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:13.360]   Really?
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:14.640]   It walked into the conference center,
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:17.280]   and it was just deathly quiet.
[00:04:17.280 --> 00:04:19.960]   Partly anyone walking around, you go into the one showcase
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.160]   room and there were a bunch of--
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:22.800]   there were a few booths set up.
[00:04:22.800 --> 00:04:25.160]   I mean, it was kind of like Barker Hanger of last year.
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:28.560]   I don't know if you guys recall that, of course you do.
[00:04:28.560 --> 00:04:32.280]   But it was very small, kind of intimate, I guess, in a way,
[00:04:32.280 --> 00:04:33.960]   and just not that exciting.
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:35.840]   What was Barker Hanger?
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:38.840]   Barker Hanger was where E3 last year was in Santa Monica,
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.800]   and it was spread over a bunch of different hotel rooms,
[00:04:40.800 --> 00:04:41.280]   basically.
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:44.280]   They cut it down from the giant spectacle of years past
[00:04:44.280 --> 00:04:47.840]   and made it a more press-oriented kind of thing.
[00:04:47.840 --> 00:04:49.520]   Even though in the past it was press-oriented.
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:51.480]   Now, it was really--
[00:04:51.480 --> 00:04:53.800]   they hardly spent any money on the damn thing.
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:04:56.520]   And it was hard to get around.
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:58.200]   There wasn't really all that much going on.
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:00.440]   And then Barker Hanger was an old airplane hanger
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:01.760]   that they used for special events.
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:04.760]   And that was the closest thing to a show floor
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:06.560]   that they had that year.
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:09.160]   Yeah, it's highly, highly regulated.
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:11.840]   Like, for instance, each the Barker Hanger version,
[00:05:11.840 --> 00:05:15.480]   as Veronica said, there was a similar, similar-sized room
[00:05:15.480 --> 00:05:18.760]   at the LA Convention Center where it was this year.
[00:05:18.760 --> 00:05:21.600]   And it's highly regulated, meaning every developer
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:24.280]   or publisher or platform could only
[00:05:24.280 --> 00:05:27.240]   have X number of boot space and X number of kiosks
[00:05:27.240 --> 00:05:29.400]   and all the kiosks were exactly the same.
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:31.320]   All the screens were exactly the same.
[00:05:31.320 --> 00:05:34.480]   So it was really-- it was rather antiseptic.
[00:05:34.480 --> 00:05:35.200]   Why is that?
[00:05:35.200 --> 00:05:37.320]   I mean, two years ago, E3 was probably
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:40.040]   the most jazzy conference of them all.
[00:05:40.040 --> 00:05:41.840]   I guess, and they said, we're not going to do it this way
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:44.720]   anymore because there's too many normal people getting in.
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:46.000]   Was that the problem?
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.840]   Oh, correct me if I'm wrong, you guys.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.960]   But I think it was because the developers and the companies,
[00:05:50.960 --> 00:05:53.480]   like Microsoft and Sony, they were all kind of sick
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:55.880]   of playing millions and millions of dollars
[00:05:55.880 --> 00:05:57.760]   for this event that was basically just press.
[00:05:57.760 --> 00:05:59.600]   It wasn't really helping them sell any games
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:00.840]   at the end of the day.
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.000]   And so they said, we're not going to do it anymore.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:06.800]   And so the ESA, the organization that throws E3,
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:09.520]   nearly went bankrupt and had to way pair down
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:10.280]   the trade show.
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:10.640]   I don't know.
[00:06:10.640 --> 00:06:11.440]   That's what I've heard.
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:11.920]   So it's time.
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:16.160]   If Microsoft, Sony, and Nintendo don't attend something
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:18.360]   like this, there is no show.
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:20.840]   You've got to keep those big three happy.
[00:06:20.840 --> 00:06:22.360]   Here's the thing with the conference.
[00:06:22.360 --> 00:06:24.760]   And the video game industry by its very nature
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:26.920]   really isn't the kind of business
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:29.160]   that you would think would have these major conferences anyway.
[00:06:29.160 --> 00:06:32.240]   I mean, it's very different from the tech industry.
[00:06:32.240 --> 00:06:34.880]   The tech industry relies on CES because they say, well,
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:36.120]   gee, we can show things off.
[00:06:36.120 --> 00:06:37.240]   We have all these neat little things.
[00:06:37.240 --> 00:06:38.680]   We can invite the major media.
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:40.760]   But the video game industry is kind of like, yeah, well,
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:42.520]   we're going to have games coming out next year.
[00:06:42.520 --> 00:06:45.080]   And we're going to have these neat little things coming out
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:46.720]   for our consoles in six months.
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:49.520]   And so you can't really build the hype as much as you can with tech.
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:51.720]   And it's just not built that way.
[00:06:51.720 --> 00:06:52.400]   Yeah, it's-- it's--
[00:06:52.400 --> 00:06:54.320]   Veronica is actually right.
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:58.120]   What happened was, is it was so big that the people--
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:00.640]   the decision makers were not able to have a discussion
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:03.000]   with the decision makers at the right levels.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.120]   And we were spending-- I mean, just for Microsoft,
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:06.880]   I don't know if you remember what our booth was like
[00:07:06.880 --> 00:07:07.640]   a couple of years ago.
[00:07:07.640 --> 00:07:10.520]   But it was literally the size of a city block.
[00:07:10.520 --> 00:07:12.360]   And it had to-- it took two weeks to build.
[00:07:12.360 --> 00:07:13.840]   It took a week to break down.
[00:07:13.840 --> 00:07:15.680]   It had to have special permits.
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.320]   It was two floors with air conditions.
[00:07:17.320 --> 00:07:19.560]   I mean, it was unbelievable.
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:21.720]   And we were spending millions and millions of dollars
[00:07:21.720 --> 00:07:24.120]   for this thing and the return on investment
[00:07:24.120 --> 00:07:26.840]   in terms of was it actually moving consoles
[00:07:26.840 --> 00:07:29.160]   or was it actually helping us in the business.
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:32.120]   It just wasn't obvious and it wasn't there.
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.320]   Well, it's a big change.
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:34.960]   Let's talk-- we're going to talk in a second about what
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:37.120]   actually happened at E3.
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:39.160]   But before we do, I want to welcome a new sponsor
[00:07:39.160 --> 00:07:40.720]   to this weekend tech.
[00:07:40.720 --> 00:07:42.000]   Actually not.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.240]   An old sponsor returning.
[00:07:43.240 --> 00:07:45.720]   The show brought to you by Visa.
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:47.280]   I really love having these guys on.
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:49.440]   With every purchase, Visa prevents, detects,
[00:07:49.440 --> 00:07:52.520]   and resolves online fraud.
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.440]   When you go online, you want to buy stuff.
[00:07:54.440 --> 00:07:55.560]   You don't want to think about-- you
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:58.880]   want to think about that new leather jacket or that new Xbox
[00:07:58.880 --> 00:08:04.280]   or whether you're going to get a metal gear solid for a PS3
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:05.680]   or you're going to get gears of warfare.
[00:08:05.680 --> 00:08:08.200]   You don't want to start thinking about online fraud
[00:08:08.200 --> 00:08:09.320]   and whether it's safe.
[00:08:09.320 --> 00:08:11.640]   That's why I use my Visa card you should too.
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:14.560]   Visa keeps out an eye out for fraud with every purchase
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:16.320]   you make with real time fraud monitoring.
[00:08:16.320 --> 00:08:18.400]   They use very sophisticated algorithms.
[00:08:18.400 --> 00:08:20.880]   We've talked about it before on the show
[00:08:20.880 --> 00:08:22.520]   where they catch stuff that is just--
[00:08:22.520 --> 00:08:26.360]   that is oddball stuff and I'm always impressed.
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:28.960]   And they will call you and they'll say, hey,
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:30.720]   this is a strange pattern.
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:31.880]   Is this you?
[00:08:31.880 --> 00:08:34.360]   And if it isn't, they take care of it.
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.440]   You are not liable for any unauthorized purchases.
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:38.920]   That's real peace of mind.
[00:08:38.920 --> 00:08:41.280]   I recently got ripped off online
[00:08:41.280 --> 00:08:43.360]   and I was because I didn't use my Visa card
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:45.960]   and I was-- I'm never again doing it without Visa.
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:48.920]   Safe, secure, Visa.
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:53.640]   We are so glad to have them on this week in tech.
[00:08:53.640 --> 00:08:58.360]   Now, so it's a pared down show, E3.
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:08:59.720]   It's a smaller show.
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:03.160]   Larry, was it a more effective show for Microsoft this year?
[00:09:03.160 --> 00:09:06.400]   Well, it's kind of tough to say because it's cyclical each year.
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:09.800]   Some folks have different levels of announcements.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:11.640]   We had a fairly large year this year.
[00:09:11.640 --> 00:09:14.480]   In fact, I would argue we almost had too much information
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:15.280]   to share this year.
[00:09:15.280 --> 00:09:18.440]   I mean, the dashboard update alone probably would have--
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:18.960]   was to fly.
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.880]   So we had just a litany of other announcements
[00:09:20.880 --> 00:09:23.200]   from our third and first parties.
[00:09:23.200 --> 00:09:25.560]   So it was actually fairly successful for us.
[00:09:25.560 --> 00:09:28.800]   And we looked back last over the past week or so.
[00:09:28.800 --> 00:09:30.960]   We're really, really happy with what happened.
[00:09:30.960 --> 00:09:32.280]   Who is the audience?
[00:09:32.280 --> 00:09:33.800]   Is it the press?
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.760]   Is it game sellers?
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.840]   I mean, you go to Comdex or--
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:39.760]   you used to go to Comdex.
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:40.640]   It was dealers.
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:42.440]   You go to CES as dealers.
[00:09:42.440 --> 00:09:45.000]   Who do you go to E3 for?
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.320]   I'm going to say this year, it's kind of evolved.
[00:09:47.320 --> 00:09:48.560]   This year was press.
[00:09:48.560 --> 00:09:50.640]   Would you guys agree with that?
[00:09:50.640 --> 00:09:52.960]   It was definitely all press.
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:53.400]   Yeah.
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:59.440]   So you're trying to get that story in the magazines,
[00:09:59.440 --> 00:10:00.760]   on Don's column, that kind of thing.
[00:10:00.760 --> 00:10:02.360]   You're trying to get the attention through--
[00:10:02.360 --> 00:10:04.560]   to get to the public through the media.
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:05.560]   Absolutely.
[00:10:05.560 --> 00:10:07.480]   In fact, we actually did something a little different
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.000]   this year.
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:11.520]   In addition to what we did at the LA Convention Center for E3,
[00:10:11.520 --> 00:10:15.600]   we actually had a similar event in New York City
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:17.760]   for a lot of the press that probably wouldn't
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.320]   make the trek across country to LA.
[00:10:20.320 --> 00:10:21.880]   So maybe the guys and the girls that
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:24.400]   are writing for the non-gaming magazines
[00:10:24.400 --> 00:10:26.160]   to come down and spend a few hours with us.
[00:10:26.160 --> 00:10:27.600]   And we walked through similar things
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:30.920]   that we announced at E3 out there in New York City.
[00:10:30.920 --> 00:10:32.080]   I'm curious what you guys think.
[00:10:32.080 --> 00:10:34.840]   Do you think this is going to be the last year, honestly?
[00:10:34.840 --> 00:10:37.440]   Like, do you think there will be other E3s?
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:38.360]   Yeah, well, here's my thought.
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:39.120]   I had an idea.
[00:10:39.120 --> 00:10:40.000]   I don't know what you guys think.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:40.840]   I like to hear what you guys think.
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.400]   But kind of make it like a presidential election sort of thing.
[00:10:43.400 --> 00:10:44.480]   OK, here's my thought.
[00:10:44.480 --> 00:10:45.800]   Why don't we make this every--
[00:10:45.800 --> 00:10:47.800]   Or the GONG show.
[00:10:47.800 --> 00:10:48.920]   Have a major--
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:49.640]   That's right.
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:52.520]   Have a major E3 every four or five years.
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:53.480]   Because this is what it does.
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.960]   I mean, generally speaking in the video game industry,
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:57.200]   the year the console is released,
[00:10:57.200 --> 00:10:59.240]   you're going to have big sales on consoles just
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:01.280]   out of the very nature that early adopters want these things,
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:01.720]   right?
[00:11:01.720 --> 00:11:03.200]   And then after that, the software starts
[00:11:03.200 --> 00:11:05.120]   selling the console and some of the extras,
[00:11:05.120 --> 00:11:07.040]   say, Xbox, Xbox Live, whatever.
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:08.680]   So why don't we make this?
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.160]   Because as you're saying, Nintendo, Sony, Microsoft,
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.360]   they're kind of governing how big this show is
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:14.960]   and how popular it is, whatever.
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:17.320]   Why don't we make this more appealing for Microsoft, Sony,
[00:11:17.320 --> 00:11:17.640]   and Nintendo?
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:19.200]   Say, hey, every four or five years,
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:20.480]   we're going to have a major show.
[00:11:20.480 --> 00:11:21.720]   This will give you the opportunity
[00:11:21.720 --> 00:11:23.880]   to announce your new consoles, talk about these big ideas.
[00:11:23.880 --> 00:11:25.520]   And after that, we'll have these little shows
[00:11:25.520 --> 00:11:26.880]   all around the world or whatever.
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:28.400]   You can just talk about your show.
[00:11:28.400 --> 00:11:30.200]   Don't you think things happen faster
[00:11:30.200 --> 00:11:32.240]   than every four years in this business?
[00:11:32.240 --> 00:11:34.080]   Well, no, the problem there is that you have
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:36.520]   most of these shows in between are all about software.
[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:37.480]   I mean, you're talking about sport,
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:38.480]   you're talking about a little big planet,
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.560]   you're talking about all these big things.
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:41.880]   And it's becoming a derivative industry in a lot of ways.
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.240]   You have all these first-person shooters,
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.360]   you have all these sports games,
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:46.120]   and they're kind of just showing up all over the place.
[00:11:46.120 --> 00:11:47.800]   So why don't we have, we just love this little show,
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:49.920]   but why don't we have a major show like we used to have?
[00:11:49.920 --> 00:11:52.160]   Every four or five have to predict what the cycle is,
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:52.320]   though.
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:54.160]   Can you predict that cycle?
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:56.120]   Right, well, I mean, nowadays,
[00:11:56.120 --> 00:11:57.280]   he kind of can't even though
[00:11:57.280 --> 00:11:58.840]   so when he's talking about their 10-year cycle
[00:11:58.840 --> 00:11:59.360]   and everything else.
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.760]   They can develop around it even.
[00:12:00.760 --> 00:12:01.240]   Right, yeah.
[00:12:01.240 --> 00:12:03.320]   If they have to, it could be kind of the destination event
[00:12:03.320 --> 00:12:05.760]   where the developers are actually planning for the event
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.480]   to make their major announcements.
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:09.120]   Instead of having to throw stuff out early,
[00:12:09.120 --> 00:12:11.240]   that's not ready every year for E3,
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:12.560]   just so they have something to talk about.
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:13.560]   Make it like the Olympics.
[00:12:13.560 --> 00:12:14.600]   What do you think, Major Nelson?
[00:12:14.600 --> 00:12:15.600]   Is that a good idea?
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:17.320]   I think that's definitely one way to do it.
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:20.240]   I would also argue that maybe we should find,
[00:12:20.240 --> 00:12:22.400]   you know, we talked about the old E3.
[00:12:22.400 --> 00:12:26.560]   And while it wasn't ever a consumer-only event,
[00:12:26.560 --> 00:12:27.520]   it kind of was.
[00:12:27.520 --> 00:12:29.720]   I mean, anybody that could fog or mirror
[00:12:29.720 --> 00:12:30.600]   could really get into play.
[00:12:30.600 --> 00:12:32.080]   (laughing)
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:35.200]   So I think what we need to do is I think maybe it's something
[00:12:35.200 --> 00:12:39.200]   like this for the industry, maybe something like that,
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.200]   something every couple of years, or Olympic,
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.720]   or presidential style.
[00:12:42.720 --> 00:12:44.640]   But I also think there's definitely value
[00:12:44.640 --> 00:12:46.680]   to having a consumer-type show,
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:48.600]   maybe like digital life in New York.
[00:12:48.600 --> 00:12:52.160]   And I know that the E3 folks tried this E4 all thing
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:53.600]   in the fall last year.
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:55.440]   I assume they're gonna do it again this year.
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:56.960]   I don't know if that's the right thing
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:12:59.200]   because they had it when all the kids were back in school.
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:01.320]   And it must be clear, a majority of our audience
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:04.360]   tends to be in either college or high school.
[00:13:04.360 --> 00:13:05.680]   So that's kind of maybe--
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:07.800]   - Isn't that a, isn't, I thought that was a complete misnomer.
[00:13:07.800 --> 00:13:09.560]   The people who play video games
[00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:11.640]   are really not kids anymore.
[00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:12.480]   Are they?
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:13.480]   - Yeah, it's pretty easy.
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:15.720]   I wrote a column about a month ago.
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:17.000]   And I wrote two.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:18.680]   The first one is about the misnomer
[00:13:18.680 --> 00:13:19.920]   that kids play video games.
[00:13:19.920 --> 00:13:20.800]   When you look at the average age,
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:21.640]   depending what you look at,
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:23.120]   they're in between 28 to 32,
[00:13:23.120 --> 00:13:25.120]   somewhere in that range, the average age today.
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.200]   Then you look at women, they say,
[00:13:26.200 --> 00:13:27.360]   "Oh, women don't play games."
[00:13:27.360 --> 00:13:29.000]   (laughing)
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:30.520]   - Well, Veronica plays games.
[00:13:30.520 --> 00:13:31.680]   I could tell you that right now.
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:32.520]   - Exactly.
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:34.200]   40% of gamers are women.
[00:13:34.200 --> 00:13:36.600]   And it's growing every day.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.280]   - But Major Nelson, you know your audience.
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:39.800]   Are you saying it's a kid audience?
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.920]   - Well, no, I'm saying that part of the audience,
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:45.240]   while it's not, it may not be the majority.
[00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:46.560]   I'll have to go back and check my numbers.
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:47.680]   I'm just thinking here.
[00:13:47.680 --> 00:13:51.440]   But that is, that is by far the most vocal part of the audience.
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:53.080]   Oh yeah, well that's true.
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:56.200]   They're the people at the time to make a big deal about it.
[00:13:56.200 --> 00:13:57.040]   - Precisely.
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:13:58.800]   - But they don't really often have the money
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:00.840]   to make the big sales.
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:03.280]   - Yeah, I'm just thinking like when I say summer,
[00:14:03.280 --> 00:14:05.720]   I know that summer tends to be a little bit looser
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:07.560]   with not with everybody's time, not only with kids,
[00:14:07.560 --> 00:14:10.240]   but even with adults and whatnot going on vacations
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:11.320]   and holidays.
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:14.160]   You know, I know that one of the greatest game conventions
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.920]   I've been to is the Leipzig game convention in Germany,
[00:14:16.920 --> 00:14:18.520]   which is held at the end of the market.
[00:14:18.520 --> 00:14:19.840]   - Oh, that sounds like fun.
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:21.520]   - That is just fantastic.
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:23.080]   There's a couple of things that are happening there.
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:25.080]   A, it's a consumer show.
[00:14:25.080 --> 00:14:27.960]   B, it is in this world-class facility
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:29.840]   that is like on all the rail lines.
[00:14:29.840 --> 00:14:31.840]   It's literally, basically it's two hours away
[00:14:31.840 --> 00:14:34.320]   from every major population center in Europe.
[00:14:34.320 --> 00:14:37.920]   And it's just an amazing, amazing show
[00:14:37.920 --> 00:14:39.800]   when you see hundreds and hundreds of thousands of people
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:40.800]   on that Saturday.
[00:14:40.800 --> 00:14:42.600]   And again, it's a consumer-based show.
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.440]   So I think it's, we have to take that into effect
[00:14:45.440 --> 00:14:47.680]   of when a show like this could exist.
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:48.840]   - Well, it's like that too.
[00:14:48.840 --> 00:14:50.320]   - Go ahead, Ron. - Sorry.
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:51.680]   It's like Tokyo Game Show also.
[00:14:51.680 --> 00:14:53.800]   The first two days is open to the press
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:55.080]   and then they open it up to everyone.
[00:14:55.080 --> 00:14:56.280]   And that's when it really blows up
[00:14:56.280 --> 00:15:00.400]   because all the cosplayers and all the huge video game fans
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.520]   start just rolling into this convention center.
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:04.120]   And it brings, it gives it a whole new life
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:06.000]   that it didn't have when the press was just there.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:07.880]   - Well, speaking as a mainstream press,
[00:15:07.880 --> 00:15:09.880]   in other words, somebody who's not particularly
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:11.800]   following the gaming industry,
[00:15:11.800 --> 00:15:14.760]   it's this is an important component to the whole thing.
[00:15:14.760 --> 00:15:17.040]   If there is not that buzz, that excitement,
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:20.240]   the crowds, E3 looked to me.
[00:15:20.240 --> 00:15:21.880]   In fact, I came into this show thinking,
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:23.520]   "Ah, big deal."
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:24.400]   Nothing happened.
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:25.520]   There were no big announcements.
[00:15:25.520 --> 00:15:28.160]   Obviously there were, but I didn't really pay attention
[00:15:28.160 --> 00:15:30.960]   to them because they didn't have that crowd going wild.
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:32.400]   And I think you do need to have the consumers
[00:15:32.400 --> 00:15:33.800]   there making a big deal out of it.
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:36.200]   - Yeah, I mean, there's something to say for that
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:38.160]   because as everyone pointed out,
[00:15:38.160 --> 00:15:40.280]   when you have the consumers that are changing the flavor
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.200]   of the show, Ron, because you were sitting in the audience
[00:15:43.200 --> 00:15:44.960]   when we made some of those announcements
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:46.840]   that the Microsoft press briefing.
[00:15:46.840 --> 00:15:49.400]   And I mean, I was like, when we showed the new dashboard
[00:15:49.400 --> 00:15:51.240]   for the first time, I was sitting backstage,
[00:15:51.240 --> 00:15:52.760]   I was like, "What's the press gonna do?"
[00:15:52.760 --> 00:15:55.160]   And they were completely stone-faced.
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:56.880]   (laughing)
[00:15:56.880 --> 00:15:57.880]   - That's what it was supposed to be.
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:59.280]   They don't stand up in a plot.
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:00.560]   They're the press.
[00:16:00.560 --> 00:16:01.400]   - Precisely.
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:02.400]   And then, you know that.
[00:16:02.400 --> 00:16:03.240]   - No, that's not true.
[00:16:03.240 --> 00:16:04.760]   The press will stand up in a plot.
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:07.040]   If you go to a Steve note, the presser,
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:09.040]   like, you know, they don't get in the bad boys
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:09.880]   all the sudden.
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:11.040]   - That bugs the hell out of me.
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:12.600]   That's not what the press is supposed to do.
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:13.440]   We're not supposed to--
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:14.280]   - You have to be known to have--
[00:16:14.280 --> 00:16:16.360]   - Sheer or Boo, we're supposed to cover.
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:17.200]   - Right.
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.200]   So I just, what I'm saying is,
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:21.120]   when you pack the first 15 rows of the keynote
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.560]   with fanboys, you're gonna get a different electricity.
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:25.440]   That's just entertainment.
[00:16:25.440 --> 00:16:26.280]   That's just show business.
[00:16:26.280 --> 00:16:27.360]   - Hey, Steve, Josh knows that.
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.960]   Who do you think they, that's exactly what they do at keynote.
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:32.360]   They stack the front of the audience.
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:34.200]   They don't let the press sit in the front.
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.600]   - Right.
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:37.200]   - Well, let's talk about what was,
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:39.760]   so now I'm convinced E3 was a big show,
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:41.960]   very important, very exciting, right?
[00:16:41.960 --> 00:16:42.800]   I don't know.
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.840]   But anyway, let's talk about what happened.
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:46.040]   And we'll start with you, Major Nelson,
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:49.120]   since you were there on behalf of Microsoft.
[00:16:49.120 --> 00:16:51.640]   Sounds like the dashboard was a big announcement.
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:53.400]   - Yeah, we had a series of announcements.
[00:16:53.400 --> 00:16:55.520]   We had both software announcements.
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:56.880]   We had the dashboard update,
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:59.080]   which is gonna be coming later this year.
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:01.080]   Basically, everybody that has,
[00:17:01.080 --> 00:17:04.000]   anybody that's purchased an Xbox 360,
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.800]   back when we launched up until now,
[00:17:05.800 --> 00:17:07.920]   they're gonna get a complete visual refresh
[00:17:07.920 --> 00:17:10.720]   of what people now know as the dashboard.
[00:17:10.720 --> 00:17:15.280]   We're actually taking every function of the dashboard today,
[00:17:15.280 --> 00:17:16.920]   and we're moving it to the guide.
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:18.560]   So it's gonna be one button across the way.
[00:17:18.560 --> 00:17:19.680]   Everything is gonna be there,
[00:17:19.680 --> 00:17:22.040]   and we're introducing this new concept of,
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:23.920]   you know, avatars, which some people are calling them,
[00:17:23.920 --> 00:17:24.760]   the MeToo, you know, the--
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:26.080]   - Yeah.
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:27.400]   - Me Too16.
[00:17:27.400 --> 00:17:29.400]   - Yeah, let's talk a little bit about that.
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:30.240]   - Okay, sure.
[00:17:30.240 --> 00:17:33.240]   - People thought that was a little bit of a copy,
[00:17:33.240 --> 00:17:35.040]   perhaps, of the Wii.
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:37.160]   Look, what are you going for there?
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:38.280]   - Well, I think, you know,
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:41.040]   as I had an interesting discussion with Amia Modos
[00:17:41.040 --> 00:17:42.160]   on came by our booth,
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:45.080]   and he is the brainchild behind the Wii,
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:46.600]   and many of Nintendo's biggest hits,
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:49.200]   and of course, of course, the MeToo.
[00:17:49.200 --> 00:17:51.160]   And, you know, he's something very interesting.
[00:17:51.160 --> 00:17:52.800]   He's like, you know, when they came out with it,
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.680]   it wasn't that they had, it was their idea.
[00:17:55.680 --> 00:17:57.520]   Certainly there's been avatars before.
[00:17:57.520 --> 00:18:00.200]   It was that they had something to add to it.
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.720]   And I think that's the exact approach,
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:05.680]   is that we've got something to add to the concept of avatars,
[00:18:05.680 --> 00:18:08.320]   and, you know, using them very aggressively in-game.
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:10.000]   Just being able to take what,
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:12.320]   Nintendo is a fantastic company.
[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:13.520]   It does some wonderful work.
[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.360]   So let's take a look at what they've done,
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:16.480]   and try to build on it,
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:18.920]   and bring it to our audience as well.
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:19.920]   - Well, you know what I love about this,
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:21.560]   and this is what I always think is funny.
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:22.720]   I talk to people from Microsoft,
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:23.880]   talk to people from Sony.
[00:18:23.880 --> 00:18:26.640]   They all say, well, Nintendo is not really our competitor.
[00:18:26.640 --> 00:18:27.680]   We don't compete with Nintendo.
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:28.520]   - I think that's- - Yeah,
[00:18:28.520 --> 00:18:30.640]   they're the number one console in the nation now.
[00:18:30.640 --> 00:18:31.480]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:34.160]   - And I told them that- - 66,000 in June,
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:36.560]   10.9 million total.
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:38.320]   I think they're competing.
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:39.160]   - Yeah, exactly. - They're selling a lot
[00:18:39.160 --> 00:18:40.280]   of hardware, but they're not selling
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:41.240]   an awful lot of software.
[00:18:41.240 --> 00:18:42.080]   - Is that true?
[00:18:42.080 --> 00:18:43.440]   The games aren't selling?
[00:18:43.440 --> 00:18:44.280]   They're not. - Well-
[00:18:44.280 --> 00:18:45.120]   - I mean, they've got the games
[00:18:45.120 --> 00:18:45.960]   that come bundled with the hardware.
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:46.800]   - We sports is too good.
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:47.840]   - They're performing in the same way.
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:49.160]   I mean, who knows?
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:51.120]   - Well, I mean, I just think,
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:52.720]   I mean, the attachment is a little bit lower
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:54.080]   than it is on Sony and Microsoft,
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.080]   and I find that even my way, it collects dust a lot,
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:57.440]   and I don't play it all that often.
[00:18:57.440 --> 00:18:59.760]   But I think that, you know, by its very nature,
[00:18:59.760 --> 00:19:01.400]   the Wii is a competitor with Microsoft,
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:03.600]   the Xbox 360 is a competitor to the PlayStation 3.
[00:19:03.600 --> 00:19:05.320]   And when you go to these E3 conferences,
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:06.960]   and you listen to these people talk,
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:08.560]   they say, they always, you know,
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:10.400]   Sony and Microsoft don't ever mention Nintendo.
[00:19:10.400 --> 00:19:11.400]   They hate to mention Nintendo,
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:12.360]   but then they come out with things
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:13.200]   that we're just talking about,
[00:19:13.200 --> 00:19:15.120]   and it kind of looks, well, gee, it kind of looks
[00:19:15.120 --> 00:19:16.400]   awfully separate. - You copy it,
[00:19:16.400 --> 00:19:18.080]   and they love that copy in there.
[00:19:18.080 --> 00:19:19.680]   - Yeah, I don't know. - I don't know.
[00:19:19.680 --> 00:19:22.040]   - You know, we have to recognize the success
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:24.440]   that Nintendo has had kind of going
[00:19:24.440 --> 00:19:26.800]   into a different direction in the years past.
[00:19:26.800 --> 00:19:29.000]   You know, they didn't enjoy the success
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.520]   in the GameCube that they had hoped.
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:31.640]   So they kind of stepped back,
[00:19:31.640 --> 00:19:33.840]   and they had the opportunity to rejigger
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:36.360]   and kind of do something, you know, innovative and different.
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:40.000]   And what we've noticed is that's one way to reach
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:41.080]   and broaden your base.
[00:19:41.080 --> 00:19:42.360]   We all want the fanboys,
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:45.160]   we're all gonna have the fanboys, the Xbox 360.
[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:46.960]   Everybody knows it's the shooter box,
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:49.920]   we got Gears of War, Halo, the list goes on and on and on.
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:51.880]   But, you know, in order to be more successful
[00:19:51.880 --> 00:19:53.040]   in this business, how do you,
[00:19:53.040 --> 00:19:53.960]   I mean, everybody knows this,
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:55.880]   how do you broaden your user base?
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:57.320]   And that's what we need to figure out
[00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.200]   how to do for the Xbox 360.
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.920]   And we're doing that, we're working on that this year
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:03.960]   with some of the other announcements we made
[00:20:03.960 --> 00:20:06.080]   at the briefing included Lips,
[00:20:06.080 --> 00:20:07.440]   which is a, you know,
[00:20:07.440 --> 00:20:09.280]   which is gonna have a couple of wireless microphones
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:10.240]   you're gonna be able to use your,
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:12.640]   basically it's not karaoke,
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:14.800]   that's kind of not a good way to put it,
[00:20:14.800 --> 00:20:18.200]   but it's similar to that, you know, just to boil it down.
[00:20:18.200 --> 00:20:20.760]   You know, we've got that, we've got a banjo-ka-zooie game
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:22.000]   for a lot of folks who like that,
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:24.160]   we've got You're in the movies, which we showed off.
[00:20:24.160 --> 00:20:26.200]   So, we're trying a bunch of different things
[00:20:26.200 --> 00:20:28.840]   to get a lot more people interested in this box
[00:20:28.840 --> 00:20:30.480]   that gaming is more and more mainstream.
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:33.000]   - What's all this about urine in the movies?
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.080]   I thought there's been too much urine in the movies.
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:37.880]   And, (laughs)
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:38.720]   what?
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:39.560]   - Oh, it was so weird when I was walking on.
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:41.440]   - The Microsoft announcement,
[00:20:41.440 --> 00:20:43.160]   a guy I knew from college,
[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:46.440]   was actually the main dude in the CNET spot
[00:20:46.440 --> 00:20:48.680]   in the CNET Vignette, Vignette.
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:49.680]   That cracked me up.
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:50.520]   - Isn't that right?
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:51.360]   - It was like, I know that guy.
[00:20:51.360 --> 00:20:52.200]   - He's my college.
[00:20:52.200 --> 00:20:55.680]   So, are you saying casual gaming, Major Nelson?
[00:20:55.680 --> 00:20:57.800]   Is that it, or is it social gaming?
[00:20:57.800 --> 00:20:59.840]   - It's, I think I would say it's definitely social gaming.
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:01.880]   I mean, let's be clear, you know, Microsoft,
[00:21:01.880 --> 00:21:05.760]   we've got one of the largest, you know,
[00:21:05.760 --> 00:21:08.800]   with Xbox Live, it is by sheer nature social gaming.
[00:21:08.800 --> 00:21:11.880]   So, we're gonna figure out how we can build on that success,
[00:21:11.880 --> 00:21:14.880]   how we can build on the infrastructure that we have,
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:16.400]   and make it bigger and better.
[00:21:16.400 --> 00:21:19.120]   - Is that about pulling in new people?
[00:21:19.120 --> 00:21:19.960]   - Of course it is.
[00:21:19.960 --> 00:21:21.680]   Absolutely, it's about how do we get more people?
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:24.040]   I mean, you know, we have to do, you know,
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:26.440]   we have to look at what we can do to sell more boxes,
[00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:29.080]   get, you know, sell more copies of our games
[00:21:29.080 --> 00:21:30.760]   and third party games, 'cause, you know,
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:32.600]   this is a razor blade and razor business.
[00:21:32.600 --> 00:21:33.440]   You know, we talk about the--
[00:21:33.440 --> 00:21:36.280]   - Until the we happen, well, 'cause we is a different
[00:21:36.280 --> 00:21:37.200]   kind of social gaming.
[00:21:37.200 --> 00:21:38.960]   It's social, it's living room gaming.
[00:21:38.960 --> 00:21:41.520]   It's social like with people right next to you,
[00:21:41.520 --> 00:21:44.840]   as opposed to Xbox Live, which is social gaming
[00:21:44.840 --> 00:21:46.800]   with people all over the internet.
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:47.640]   - Precisely.
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:50.840]   - Did the success of the we must have taken you
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:53.480]   a little bit by some, certainly took me by surprise.
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:55.960]   Did it change your strategy?
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:58.080]   - I wouldn't say it changed our strategy,
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:21:59.800]   but it definitely made us look at like,
[00:21:59.800 --> 00:22:03.280]   wait a minute, is society ready for this approach?
[00:22:03.280 --> 00:22:06.240]   And the we have clearly indicated there's, you know,
[00:22:06.240 --> 00:22:09.040]   with their success, that people are open
[00:22:09.040 --> 00:22:11.000]   to this type of gaming.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.360]   And again, it's not just this type of gaming,
[00:22:13.360 --> 00:22:15.280]   but it's also about the titles.
[00:22:15.280 --> 00:22:16.640]   I mean, I've got a Wii in my house,
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:19.080]   my wife and I love playing Wii Sport.
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:19.880]   - Yeah.
[00:22:19.880 --> 00:22:21.520]   - But it's not something we play every night.
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:24.400]   - My 75 year old mom is saying,
[00:22:24.400 --> 00:22:27.360]   "Should I get a Wii 'cause I think we fit
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:30.120]   would be good for me to do some exercise."
[00:22:30.120 --> 00:22:30.920]   - Yeah, it's that whole thing.
[00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:33.520]   When Nintendo had their keynote at GDC,
[00:22:33.520 --> 00:22:35.200]   not this year, but the year before,
[00:22:35.200 --> 00:22:37.920]   Miyamoto-Son made a big deal about how his wife
[00:22:37.920 --> 00:22:38.920]   is playing the Wii.
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:41.200]   And there's this whole demographic out there
[00:22:41.200 --> 00:22:44.680]   of people who are, you know, not in the 18 to 34 year old
[00:22:44.680 --> 00:22:47.320]   male demographic that are interested in gaming
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:50.000]   and just don't really, may not know how to get involved
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:51.520]   with it or know what titles are out there
[00:22:51.520 --> 00:22:52.600]   and available to them.
[00:22:52.600 --> 00:22:55.760]   And I think the whole thing that Microsoft and Sony
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:57.280]   are going to be trying to do in the future
[00:22:57.280 --> 00:22:59.000]   is really tap into that audience.
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:22:59.840]   - Very interesting.
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:00.840]   - And you mentioned titles.
[00:23:00.840 --> 00:23:01.960]   You mentioned titles and I've,
[00:23:01.960 --> 00:23:03.560]   I actually wrote about this on Friday in the digital home
[00:23:03.560 --> 00:23:05.560]   and I said, "Listen, the problem right now,"
[00:23:05.560 --> 00:23:08.280]   and the title was, "I'm boycotting first person shooters."
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:09.120]   And I am.
[00:23:09.120 --> 00:23:10.400]   - Yes, because there's too many,
[00:23:10.400 --> 00:23:12.800]   it's unoriginal, the hell with them.
[00:23:12.800 --> 00:23:13.880]   - They are all over the same level.
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:15.000]   - Except I'm buying Post-Sil3
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:17.640]   'cause I just love that kind of mayhem.
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:18.600]   - But you know, if nothing else,
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:19.640]   Nintendo has shown something.
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:22.960]   It's shown that innovation really is still key
[00:23:22.960 --> 00:23:25.000]   in this business and maybe we'll,
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:26.280]   well, Harris, you know, that's real good.
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:28.160]   We'll write, we'll show that with Spore
[00:23:28.160 --> 00:23:29.920]   and we'll maybe see the Little Big Planet
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:31.840]   and other titles from Nintendo and everything else.
[00:23:31.840 --> 00:23:34.560]   But I'm sick and tired of the derivative gameplay,
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:36.480]   the derivative titles and it's not stopping.
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:38.040]   I realize it's a bottom line business.
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:39.440]   And it's like, okay, we're gonna make more money
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:41.840]   on Final Fantasy 13 that we're going to make on,
[00:23:41.840 --> 00:23:44.840]   you know, whatever, Don's latest, you know, wild adventure.
[00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:47.280]   But, you know, why don't we have more innovation
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:48.120]   in the space?
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:48.960]   I think we do need it.
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:51.120]   I think that the consumers,
[00:23:51.120 --> 00:23:52.880]   especially now that Nintendo's bringing more people in,
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:54.240]   the consumers really want that.
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:55.880]   - I'll tell you why we don't have more innovation
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:24:00.600]   because it now costs $100 million to make a game.
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:04.480]   And you can't take that chance unless you know you got a hit.
[00:24:04.480 --> 00:24:05.320]   - So look at something like the hurdle.
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:07.320]   You know, for example, there's a really innovative game
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:09.800]   that wasn't made for millions and millions of dollars
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:11.120]   that blew everyone out of the water.
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:13.240]   And we're gonna see the same thing with, you know,
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:14.880]   Little Big Planet, which is obviously made
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:16.600]   for a problem more than Portal was,
[00:24:16.600 --> 00:24:18.480]   but just the innovative gameplay style
[00:24:18.480 --> 00:24:20.720]   that is kind of taking people unawares
[00:24:20.720 --> 00:24:23.240]   and really drawing them into the consoles again.
[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:24.840]   - Also, one of the things you're gonna see,
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:26.840]   you know, what we've announced, we announced a GDC,
[00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:28.880]   you know, last year, and we're talking about this year
[00:24:28.880 --> 00:24:31.000]   is we've got our XNA initiative,
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.840]   where for the first time using the tools
[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:36.240]   that we've got available for XNA game creator,
[00:24:36.240 --> 00:24:37.080]   you're gonna be able to-- - That's exciting.
[00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:38.440]   - Anybody can write their own game
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:40.440]   and put it on the Xbox console.
[00:24:40.440 --> 00:24:42.680]   - And we're starting to see 'em, and it's very exciting.
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:44.320]   - Yeah, we're gonna have some announcements over the next
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:45.920]   couple of weeks that people are really gonna enjoy
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:48.080]   about how we're gonna be moving forward in that space.
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:49.880]   So it's gonna be, we're really excited about it,
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:50.920]   but that's exactly what it is.
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:53.200]   We're trying to get everything 'cause games are freaking
[00:24:53.200 --> 00:24:54.440]   expensive to make.
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:56.080]   They are gambles.
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:58.480]   And if it doesn't do well, then it, you know,
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:00.840]   could really, it could bring a company down.
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:03.040]   So everyone's absolutely right.
[00:25:03.040 --> 00:25:04.480]   - That's why we see so many sequels
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:06.360]   and in a way, unoriginal stuff.
[00:25:06.360 --> 00:25:08.400]   Although, you know, I hear everybody say, oh, you know,
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:10.200]   first person shooter is how unoriginal.
[00:25:10.200 --> 00:25:13.040]   And then you see, you know, Halo have this amazing first day.
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:16.520]   You see, you know, Metal Gear Solid having amazing,
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:20.240]   say, I mean, yeah, we may say that, but people are playing them.
[00:25:20.240 --> 00:25:22.120]   - Well, it's the same concept with Hollywood.
[00:25:22.120 --> 00:25:24.320]   They keep turning out the same films.
[00:25:24.320 --> 00:25:25.960]   I mean, here's another Batman this weekend,
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:28.600]   which had $150 million.
[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:29.920]   - And it's actually better than Hollywood
[00:25:29.920 --> 00:25:32.640]   because while Hollywood sequels tend to be worse,
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:34.200]   Dark Knight accepted,
[00:25:34.200 --> 00:25:35.120]   - Right.
[00:25:35.120 --> 00:25:37.640]   - Game sequels are almost invariably better
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:39.800]   'cause the technology's improved, you know,
[00:25:39.800 --> 00:25:41.240]   the game is better understood.
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:43.440]   They just almost always, I mean, less, they're really cheesy.
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:44.280]   They're usually better.
[00:25:44.280 --> 00:25:45.280]   - Right, right.
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:46.120]   - You know, you mentioned Halo.
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:48.480]   See, I think Halo got worse this time of not, you know?
[00:25:48.480 --> 00:25:51.920]   And I think that, I don't know, I think that you have,
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:54.080]   to some extent there are some sequels that do get better.
[00:25:54.080 --> 00:25:56.080]   I mean, Final Fantasy is a prime example of that.
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:57.360]   But, you know, maybe it's just me,
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:25:58.520]   maybe I'm old school or whatever.
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:01.400]   I grew up on, you know, the old NES days,
[00:26:01.400 --> 00:26:03.400]   the old SNES days, these old games
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:05.440]   that didn't cost a lot, but they're fun, you know?
[00:26:05.440 --> 00:26:08.560]   And there's not enough, in my opinion right now,
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:11.040]   that's fun, just in the old sense of the term.
[00:26:11.040 --> 00:26:12.120]   I mean, you have some cool games,
[00:26:12.120 --> 00:26:14.160]   you have Metal Gear Solid 4 and all these great things,
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:15.400]   and they were great in GTA 4,
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:18.320]   but were they really that fun to play after a while?
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:20.280]   I mean, for me, GTA 4, I finished it,
[00:26:20.280 --> 00:26:21.320]   but I haven't played it since.
[00:26:21.320 --> 00:26:23.600]   And Metal Gear Solid, I'm like, ah, God, I mean,
[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:25.520]   yeah, maybe people are looking for something new,
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:26.360]   maybe something different.
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:28.160]   I think that's why LittleBigPlanet's very interesting.
[00:26:28.160 --> 00:26:31.160]   I mean, I'm totally excited about Spore.
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:32.360]   - Yeah. - Yeah.
[00:26:32.360 --> 00:26:33.560]   - Definitely. - Yeah.
[00:26:33.560 --> 00:26:37.520]   So Veronica, what, do you, I mean, okay,
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:39.640]   I'm sorry, this is very sexist.
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:40.680]   - (laughs) Great.
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:42.440]   - Do you like first person shooters?
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:43.400]   - I do, I do.
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:44.480]   - Typically, I would say, you know,
[00:26:44.480 --> 00:26:47.840]   this is not something women want to play Call of Duty, you know?
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:49.640]   - No, I've been playing Call of Duty online
[00:26:49.640 --> 00:26:50.480]   quite a bit, actually, lately.
[00:26:50.480 --> 00:26:51.880]   - Okay, so that's very sexist to me.
[00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:53.520]   - Sometimes I have to turn off the headset,
[00:26:53.520 --> 00:26:55.920]   but other than that, I'm good to go.
[00:26:55.920 --> 00:26:56.760]   - It's not a male thing.
[00:26:56.760 --> 00:26:58.320]   - So they don't have to hear it at the Abring Idiots.
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:00.080]   - Yo, I hate Xbox Live. - But that's all.
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:02.400]   - But it's like that all over online gaming.
[00:27:02.400 --> 00:27:03.280]   You just have to be careful.
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:05.440]   - It's kids, you know, it's 13 year old boys.
[00:27:05.440 --> 00:27:08.960]   - It is not specific to Xbox Live, it's all over.
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:09.800]   - Oh yeah. - Anycom--
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:11.440]   - Do you think it's, that's interesting.
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:13.640]   So do you think you're typical that a lot of women
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:15.520]   like to play first person shooters?
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:17.160]   - I don't know.
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:19.680]   I don't think so.
[00:27:19.680 --> 00:27:22.080]   And I don't want to say that as a sweeping generalization,
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:24.880]   but it's just been my experience that,
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:26.360]   well, you know, someone said in the chat room,
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:28.840]   Molly Wood, she plays a lot of first person shooters.
[00:27:28.840 --> 00:27:29.840]   She loves them. - Okay.
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:32.880]   - I know that Morgan Webb is big into shooters.
[00:27:32.880 --> 00:27:33.920]   - I guess so. - So there are women
[00:27:33.920 --> 00:27:36.400]   out there for sure, but not,
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:38.160]   that hasn't been to my experience overwhelmingly.
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:41.120]   - Are there more women gamers than there used to be?
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:43.200]   - Than there used to be, oh, definitely.
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:46.840]   - Your generation games, your generation games,
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:48.720]   you grew up with games, it's part of your life
[00:27:48.720 --> 00:27:50.920]   as much as anybody.
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:51.760]   - It's true.
[00:27:51.760 --> 00:27:53.480]   And I've been meeting a lot more women out there
[00:27:53.480 --> 00:27:57.400]   who are becoming more comfortable even talking about it
[00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:59.960]   in general, which, you know, it's just,
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:02.320]   between talking about technology and talking about gaming,
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:05.000]   I think it's been something that women have felt
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:06.640]   a little bit on the outskirts of
[00:28:06.640 --> 00:28:08.400]   and a little bit uncomfortable talking about,
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:11.920]   just because it is kind of, it can become kind of sexist,
[00:28:11.920 --> 00:28:13.000]   especially with guys.
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:15.120]   - Well, and I look at a title like Little Big Planet
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:19.160]   or Spore, and to me, it looks like an attempt
[00:28:19.160 --> 00:28:21.120]   to reach out to women.
[00:28:21.120 --> 00:28:24.120]   - Not sure.
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:24.960]   - Yeah, I guess I could see that.
[00:28:24.960 --> 00:28:25.800]   You know, I've heard a lot of people
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:28.200]   calling things like the Sims gateway games
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:30.280]   because it can get, they can get women
[00:28:30.280 --> 00:28:33.440]   who don't usually historically play games,
[00:28:33.440 --> 00:28:35.960]   get into them, and Spore could be that way as well.
[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:37.920]   Like, I think we can get a lot of non-gamers
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:39.160]   into playing them.
[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:41.600]   - Is that Larry something that Microsoft
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:42.560]   is paying attention to?
[00:28:42.560 --> 00:28:45.080]   Is, I mean, we've seen these initiatives.
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:47.520]   I've seen them for 15 years.
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:49.280]   Girl gaming, how do we get girls?
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:52.120]   There was a company designed around girl gaming flop.
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:53.480]   I mean, I've seen this over and over again.
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:55.000]   Is it even possible?
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:55.840]   - Absolutely.
[00:28:55.840 --> 00:28:58.680]   I mean, we've got an initiative on Xbox Live
[00:28:58.680 --> 00:28:59.600]   called Gamer Chicks.
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:02.400]   And we have over 6,000 girls, women,
[00:29:02.400 --> 00:29:05.440]   from around the world in gamer chicks.
[00:29:05.440 --> 00:29:06.960]   So it's absolutely something.
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:08.800]   And, you know, as you said earlier,
[00:29:08.800 --> 00:29:09.740]   you know, the, the, the,
[00:29:09.740 --> 00:29:13.200]   Veronica's her generation is growing up gaming.
[00:29:13.200 --> 00:29:14.440]   They're doing it on cell phones.
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:16.000]   They're doing it on Nintendo D.S.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.600]   They've grown up with game boys in their back pocket.
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:21.400]   So gaming is another, is, is there some of them?
[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:23.720]   It's their preferred form of entertainment.
[00:29:23.720 --> 00:29:25.640]   So how do we get that onto the console?
[00:29:25.640 --> 00:29:26.900]   I mean, it's also, you talked about
[00:29:26.900 --> 00:29:28.360]   sport and a bunch of other games.
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:32.160]   Microsoft also has to, also has one of the largest,
[00:29:32.160 --> 00:29:35.040]   if not the largest gaming platform in the world,
[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:35.880]   which is Windows.
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:37.640]   - Good point.
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:39.720]   We should, we should not over look PC gaming.
[00:29:39.720 --> 00:29:41.280]   I mean, that's really gaming.
[00:29:41.280 --> 00:29:42.560]   - You have to be really careful though,
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:43.840]   because I think a lot of women
[00:29:43.840 --> 00:29:46.920]   don't like being specifically marketed to.
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:49.040]   You know, when it comes to technology,
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:50.480]   like it's not like, oh, make a,
[00:29:50.480 --> 00:29:52.520]   make a pink gadget and suddenly women are gonna love it.
[00:29:52.520 --> 00:29:53.720]   No, I don't think so.
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:55.600]   Make a game to women. - Work a lot of time.
[00:29:55.600 --> 00:29:57.000]   It works a lot.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:57.840]   Does it?
[00:29:57.840 --> 00:29:59.640]   Pink? - How does it work?
[00:29:59.640 --> 00:30:00.520]   - Pink what?
[00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:02.120]   - I'm just telling you, when I see,
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:04.360]   when I see a piece of electronics with black,
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:06.880]   and then all of a sudden I showed to my wife in pink,
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:08.100]   then she kind of, she kind of,
[00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:09.520]   she looked at the tech.
[00:30:09.520 --> 00:30:11.120]   - Wow, that's for me.
[00:30:11.120 --> 00:30:12.120]   - Okay, maybe some women.
[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:14.200]   - It's made of pink, I'll buy it.
[00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:15.240]   How about the white iPhone?
[00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:17.320]   Did you get a white one or a black one Veronica?
[00:30:17.320 --> 00:30:18.160]   - I got white.
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:20.120]   - Me too, 'cause I'm a girl.
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:21.600]   - I hate the piece of junk right now.
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:22.440]   I don't even wanna talk.
[00:30:22.440 --> 00:30:24.080]   - Really, you have trouble with your new iPhone?
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:25.120]   - Don't get me started.
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:27.760]   I just restored from a, I just did a clean restore.
[00:30:27.760 --> 00:30:30.360]   So hopefully now that will solve the problems,
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:33.560]   but it's been a pain in my butt for the past.
[00:30:33.560 --> 00:30:35.480]   - We'll get to that once we get past the gaming,
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:36.320]   'cause there's other stories,
[00:30:36.320 --> 00:30:37.560]   and iPhone is a big story,
[00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:39.320]   so we'll talk about that in a little bit.
[00:30:39.320 --> 00:30:40.160]   What were the, all right,
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:41.240]   I'm gonna go through each of you,
[00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:43.840]   and I'll give you a chance to start, Larry.
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:47.240]   What were the big announcements at E3,
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:48.480]   from your point of view?
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:50.280]   - Well, I'm just, it's tough for me
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:52.400]   because I've been down in the weeds
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.480]   with the dashboard update for so many--
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:56.920]   - You could say only Microsoft announcements, that's fine.
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:30:59.480]   - I'm gonna have to lead with the dashboard one.
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:03.640]   Everybody is just wowed by the Final Fantasy 13 announcement,
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:06.520]   which I don't know a single person
[00:31:06.520 --> 00:31:07.760]   with Final Fantasy 13.
[00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:09.000]   I gotta be honest with you.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:09.840]   - I know.
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:10.840]   - Final Fantasy, I should say.
[00:31:10.840 --> 00:31:12.400]   I know a lot of people do,
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:14.840]   but it's, you know, and I'm glad we've got it on our platform.
[00:31:14.840 --> 00:31:16.760]   It's just not my cup of tea.
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:18.760]   - Historically, a PlayStation game.
[00:31:18.760 --> 00:31:21.400]   - Right, absolutely, absolutely.
[00:31:21.400 --> 00:31:24.640]   - So getting that on Xbox is a big win, you feel?
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:25.640]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:27.960]   It's gonna, it's one more, I mean,
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:29.680]   which begs the bigger question,
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:31.240]   I think Jack Trenton said this,
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:32.520]   something you know, he's not, you know,
[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:33.800]   it doesn't make him happy,
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:37.800]   but I don't know if these big third party exclusives,
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:39.320]   it's their over.
[00:31:39.320 --> 00:31:41.160]   You know, because they,
[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:42.400]   - They seem to be, don't they?
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:45.200]   It doesn't seem to be that you could get those exclusives anymore.
[00:31:45.200 --> 00:31:48.200]   - Yeah, the games are so expensive to make,
[00:31:48.200 --> 00:31:50.400]   the game developers need to, you know,
[00:31:50.400 --> 00:31:52.280]   recoup their investment any way they can.
[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:54.480]   The way they can do that is by putting it on multiple platforms.
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:56.600]   - Is that partly because it's easier to do as well?
[00:31:56.600 --> 00:31:59.200]   I mean, are cross-platform tools more available?
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:01.840]   Or is it still as much work to get one game working
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:03.560]   on all three platforms?
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:06.600]   - I'm not a developer, so I'm from the wrong person,
[00:32:06.600 --> 00:32:09.800]   that's what I have chatted with developers who say it's still,
[00:32:09.800 --> 00:32:11.400]   it's still a significant chunk of work.
[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:13.520]   I mean, the two major platforms,
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:15.560]   the Xbox 360, 12 of three,
[00:32:15.560 --> 00:32:17.280]   the Wii and the PS3,
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:19.960]   they're all very different from a platform perspective,
[00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:21.760]   you in terms of the CPU and processing.
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:23.720]   So I still think there's a fair amount of work.
[00:32:23.720 --> 00:32:26.520]   It's not just, it's not File, Export, PS3,
[00:32:26.520 --> 00:32:28.680]   when you want to take the game, put it up for the.
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:29.520]   - Well, that's why first party titles.
[00:32:29.520 --> 00:32:30.360]   - Well, that's why first party titles.
[00:32:30.360 --> 00:32:31.640]   - Throw out a quick report and then they're done.
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:32.640]   - Right, right.
[00:32:32.640 --> 00:32:34.880]   That's why first party titles are so important now, I think.
[00:32:34.880 --> 00:32:37.200]   I mean, first party titles have been more important
[00:32:37.200 --> 00:32:39.160]   because now we have these third party saying,
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:40.520]   "Hey, we're just gonna put on every console."
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:43.320]   And so now, the impetus is really on Nintendo, Microsoft,
[00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:46.240]   and Sony to say, one of the best ways to differentiate
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:49.800]   our product besides price is to have a different,
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:50.920]   better library of games.
[00:32:50.920 --> 00:32:52.000]   And if as a first party,
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:54.640]   if we can create exclusive titles for our platform,
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:56.480]   that's better than Microsoft, better than Sony,
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:58.480]   better than Nintendo, whoever,
[00:32:58.480 --> 00:33:01.240]   then we may be able to tell more people to use our product.
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:05.680]   And so now I think first party developers are really
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:06.720]   in the mix all of a sudden.
[00:33:06.720 --> 00:33:08.720]   I think even Sony might have said that, not an E3,
[00:33:08.720 --> 00:33:10.720]   but a week before that they said, "Listen,
[00:33:10.720 --> 00:33:12.760]   first parties are important now,
[00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:15.240]   and we need to start spending a lot of money
[00:33:15.240 --> 00:33:17.800]   on developing games that we're going to make ourselves
[00:33:17.800 --> 00:33:20.080]   and have it just for our platform."
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:21.720]   - So that's, Don, you're absolutely right.
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:24.480]   I mean, that's one of the key tenants
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:28.760]   of a first party platform is to really be a showcase title
[00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:30.120]   for that hardware.
[00:33:30.120 --> 00:33:31.800]   And we're going to see more and more of that.
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:33.360]   And you're right, the exclusives,
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:34.720]   perhaps the third party exclusives
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:36.200]   are going to become less important
[00:33:36.200 --> 00:33:37.720]   just because of the nature of the economics.
[00:33:37.720 --> 00:33:40.600]   And the first parties are going to become even more so.
[00:33:40.600 --> 00:33:41.440]   - Right.
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:42.280]   - One of their big announcements.
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:45.760]   So the blade, the new Xbox interface,
[00:33:45.760 --> 00:33:47.840]   Final Fantasy 13, what else?
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:50.480]   - We've got of course Gears of War II coming fall out.
[00:33:50.480 --> 00:33:52.480]   I think what's interesting is that the last,
[00:33:52.480 --> 00:33:54.560]   I would say the last quarter of our show
[00:33:54.560 --> 00:33:56.160]   where we're talking about the quarter of the,
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:57.520]   we're talking about the music games.
[00:33:57.520 --> 00:33:59.240]   You guys talking a little bit about Rock Band,
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:03.120]   two is gonna be exclusive on a 360 for at least at launch.
[00:34:03.120 --> 00:34:04.640]   I don't know how long that's gonna go.
[00:34:04.640 --> 00:34:06.480]   - The time exclusives.
[00:34:06.480 --> 00:34:07.640]   - Pardon me.
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:09.400]   - Time exclusives.
[00:34:09.400 --> 00:34:10.680]   - Yeah, time exclusives.
[00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:13.560]   So there's going to be a, the music games
[00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:15.600]   are more and more important and not so much
[00:34:15.600 --> 00:34:19.320]   because for a couple of reasons, A, they're a ton of fun.
[00:34:19.320 --> 00:34:23.600]   B, look at the amount of content that is being moved
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:25.560]   in terms of the downloadable content
[00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:28.960]   and the music pieces that are being downloaded
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:29.800]   for these games.
[00:34:29.800 --> 00:34:32.120]   I mean, they are going to save the music industry.
[00:34:32.120 --> 00:34:33.160]   That's the reality.
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:38.720]   - What about Xbox Live, anything there?
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:42.360]   - Well, we're, all of our, all the announcements
[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:43.720]   we made about the dashboard,
[00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:45.920]   there's a lot of work we've done on Xbox Live
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:47.000]   for the past six or eight months.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:49.160]   I mean, the investments we've been making
[00:34:49.160 --> 00:34:52.240]   for the past six years are starting to pay off.
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:54.520]   So there's absolutely a lot of stuff that's happening
[00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:56.920]   behind the scenes that you're gonna see in the dashboard.
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:34:59.640]   - Is there gonna be an update to the, to marketplace?
[00:34:59.640 --> 00:35:00.480]   - Oh absolutely.
[00:35:00.480 --> 00:35:01.840]   It's a complete talk to bottom.
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:04.000]   One of the things we learned when we launched the 360
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:06.160]   was, you know, we're hoping to have 1500 pieces,
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:08.760]   maybe a couple thousand pieces in the marketplace
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:11.040]   and now we're up to 18,000 pieces.
[00:35:11.040 --> 00:35:13.400]   It's completely unmanageable.
[00:35:13.400 --> 00:35:15.680]   So we're basically starting all over
[00:35:15.680 --> 00:35:17.960]   and we're gonna put in a nice way to navigate that.
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:19.480]   That's one of the key things we need to do.
[00:35:19.480 --> 00:35:20.800]   - The funny thing is the biggest story,
[00:35:20.800 --> 00:35:22.760]   at least from the, my perspective,
[00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:26.120]   the mainstream perspective was Netflix on the Xbox 360.
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:27.800]   - That's what I was gonna say, right?
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:28.960]   Well, I mean, let's-
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:30.440]   - And I would actually end up with that one
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:31.840]   'cause I know that you guys were probably excited
[00:35:31.840 --> 00:35:32.680]   about that one.
[00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:34.440]   - You're not, obviously.
[00:35:34.440 --> 00:35:36.400]   - No, I'm very much so, but I wanted to kind of end up,
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:37.680]   I feel like I'm hogging it here.
[00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:39.640]   So I wanted to end up with Netflix there.
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:41.560]   That's a huge win for us.
[00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:42.960]   It'll be exclusive on a 360.
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:46.400]   It'll be shipping with the dashboard update later this fall.
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:47.800]   And you're gonna be able to use your instant,
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:49.400]   manage your instant queue on your PC
[00:35:49.400 --> 00:35:51.720]   and it automatically updates on the Xbox 360.
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:54.920]   You'll be able to watch movies on your Xbox 360.
[00:35:54.920 --> 00:35:57.240]   And if you, like Leo, if you and I,
[00:35:57.240 --> 00:35:58.520]   if I have you on my friends list,
[00:35:58.520 --> 00:36:00.880]   I can invite you in and if you're a Netflix subscriber,
[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:03.520]   you can watch the film as well with me.
[00:36:03.520 --> 00:36:04.360]   - That's awesome.
[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:05.920]   I'm very excited about that.
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:07.080]   I'm just gonna, I'll be honest,
[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:09.400]   I moved the Xbox 360 out of the bedroom
[00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:11.360]   'cause it was too noisy.
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:13.840]   But it's gonna probably move back despite the noise,
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:15.480]   just because I love the idea
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:17.040]   of being able to stream Netflix movies on it.
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:20.280]   And I've watched a lot, I've downloaded a lot of TV shows
[00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:21.120]   from the marketplace.
[00:36:21.120 --> 00:36:23.720]   I watched all of Studio 60 on the Xbox.
[00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:25.080]   I'd like to see more of that.
[00:36:25.080 --> 00:36:27.160]   I think that's, it's a very good platform for that.
[00:36:27.160 --> 00:36:28.560]   I'd like to see more of that.
[00:36:28.560 --> 00:36:30.520]   - Well, we're also gonna be talking about the noise.
[00:36:30.520 --> 00:36:33.760]   We're also, we've also got copied on hard drive.
[00:36:33.760 --> 00:36:35.320]   So you're gonna be able to copy games to your hard drive,
[00:36:35.320 --> 00:36:37.000]   completely optional, which will basically
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:40.320]   spin the DVD drive down and won't make any noise.
[00:36:40.320 --> 00:36:41.280]   - And is that where most of the noise
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:42.440]   is coming from the DVD?
[00:36:42.440 --> 00:36:43.680]   - That's what we noticed a lot of the noise
[00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:45.240]   is coming through 'cause those, you know,
[00:36:45.240 --> 00:36:46.760]   games are spinning and, you know,
[00:36:46.760 --> 00:36:48.480]   especially when you're playing like a GTA 4,
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:50.160]   which is doing progressive loading.
[00:36:50.160 --> 00:36:53.320]   So the disc is spinning frequently
[00:36:53.320 --> 00:36:56.080]   to load up things that you're moving through the missions.
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:57.200]   So that's one of the areas.
[00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:59.640]   And when I played it, when you were off of the hard drive
[00:36:59.640 --> 00:37:01.560]   and one of our lab, and it's like butter.
[00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:02.880]   I mean, it's just, it's delicious.
[00:37:02.880 --> 00:37:04.200]   - That's like butter, scold,
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:05.220]   - Butter, butter, butter,
[00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:06.060]   - That's like butter.
[00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:08.520]   - I think this is gonna have a major impact on the tech.
[00:37:08.520 --> 00:37:10.160]   What I thought was the biggest announcement,
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:11.040]   that was this Netflix thing,
[00:37:11.040 --> 00:37:12.240]   because it has the biggest impact
[00:37:12.240 --> 00:37:13.680]   on the tech industry itself.
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:14.640]   And this is how I think about it.
[00:37:14.640 --> 00:37:17.560]   I mean, if nothing else, it shows that Blockbuster
[00:37:17.560 --> 00:37:20.560]   is so woefully behind that it's just,
[00:37:20.560 --> 00:37:21.880]   it's laughable at this point.
[00:37:21.880 --> 00:37:24.760]   I think that, okay fine, it's exclusive on the Xbox 360,
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:25.600]   which is great.
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:26.640]   And I think that's a big, a big step.
[00:37:26.640 --> 00:37:30.080]   And also you have the Netflix Roku box, which is great.
[00:37:30.080 --> 00:37:34.320]   But it really said to me, like, is Blockbuster this dumb?
[00:37:34.320 --> 00:37:35.720]   I mean, really to be this far behind.
[00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:37.400]   I mean, Netflix realizes that,
[00:37:37.400 --> 00:37:38.760]   listen, maybe even the mail order business
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:39.880]   isn't the future of rentals.
[00:37:39.880 --> 00:37:41.880]   And we need to make it available to streaming boxes
[00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:43.200]   like the Xbox 360.
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:45.480]   And as the number two company in the space,
[00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:46.960]   in the rental space, and you're far behind
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:48.120]   is the brick and mortar.
[00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:49.520]   When do you think to yourself, well, gee,
[00:37:49.520 --> 00:37:51.760]   you know, we really need to get things going here.
[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:53.480]   We need to be on Xbox 360.
[00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:54.640]   We need to be doing these things.
[00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:55.480]   But it's not.
[00:37:55.480 --> 00:37:58.880]   And so it's laughable that the executives are laughable.
[00:37:58.880 --> 00:38:00.760]   You know, the stock prices is way down.
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:02.280]   They're going after Circuit City.
[00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:03.120]   It's just funny.
[00:38:03.120 --> 00:38:04.120]   It's just me, it was just funny.
[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:05.600]   And as soon as I saw that announcement,
[00:38:05.600 --> 00:38:09.400]   I said just another example of Netflix outsmarting
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:12.400]   a Blockbuster and I think their time is numbered.
[00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:13.600]   - Yeah, you might be right.
[00:38:13.600 --> 00:38:14.440]   You might be right.
[00:38:14.440 --> 00:38:16.800]   It's a very good partnership, you know.
[00:38:16.800 --> 00:38:18.640]   It just makes a lot of sense.
[00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:21.040]   I don't think it's gonna make a lot of numbers,
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:23.480]   but it just establishes that.
[00:38:23.480 --> 00:38:25.480]   - You don't think it'll make a lot of numbers?
[00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:26.560]   - No.
[00:38:26.560 --> 00:38:27.400]   No, I don't think so.
[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:29.160]   Well, for one thing, it's a very limited
[00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:31.040]   palette of movies, you know.
[00:38:31.040 --> 00:38:32.440]   - Hmm, there's always that issue.
[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:33.960]   - It's not the movies you want.
[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:35.640]   I could tell you right now.
[00:38:35.640 --> 00:38:36.640]   (laughing)
[00:38:36.640 --> 00:38:38.240]   - I had that problem on Apple TV.
[00:38:38.240 --> 00:38:39.680]   - Yeah, well, yeah, I mean, it's better
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:41.760]   than that's 10,000 movies, but it's not, you know,
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:43.080]   it's very few new movies.
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:45.240]   If you like old movies, it's, I mean, it's great.
[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:46.880]   If you don't have anything to watch and you,
[00:38:46.880 --> 00:38:48.560]   hey, I could stream this.
[00:38:48.560 --> 00:38:51.600]   Quality is not, you know, what you're used to.
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:53.520]   If it's anything like the Roku.
[00:38:53.520 --> 00:38:55.680]   And so I think it's kind of a,
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:58.680]   I would like to see Microsoft really take on
[00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:00.920]   this set top box idea more aggressively,
[00:39:00.920 --> 00:39:03.160]   but I just feel like the offerings there,
[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:05.000]   and I know it's not completely Microsoft's fault.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:06.480]   They gotta get the partnerships in place,
[00:39:06.480 --> 00:39:08.640]   but the offerings are limited.
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:10.240]   It's gotta, it's maybe the new dashboard
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:11.080]   will make a difference.
[00:39:11.080 --> 00:39:11.920]   Maybe it'll, maybe it'll make it.
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:12.760]   - I know we talked about that,
[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:15.520]   but we have the IPTV, which we've talked about
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:16.800]   for a couple of years now.
[00:39:16.800 --> 00:39:18.600]   We have that and we're shipping that today.
[00:39:18.600 --> 00:39:19.840]   The problem is, you're right,
[00:39:19.840 --> 00:39:22.080]   we've gotta get the varieties of the world
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:25.520]   or the Comcast, the world to wanna use the Xbox 360
[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:28.040]   as this device on their network.
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:29.960]   - Microsoft has historically had this problem.
[00:39:29.960 --> 00:39:31.840]   They've wanted to be in the set top box business
[00:39:31.840 --> 00:39:33.840]   for at least a decade, but the problem is most
[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:37.120]   of these set top boxes are much dumber, much less expensive.
[00:39:37.120 --> 00:39:39.040]   And companies are very reluctant to do something
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:40.400]   as powerful as the Xbox.
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:42.120]   It's what consumers want.
[00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:44.280]   - Right. - Consumers want the power,
[00:39:44.280 --> 00:39:46.040]   but the traditionally the cable companies
[00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:49.160]   are not interested and I'm sure the broadband providers
[00:39:49.160 --> 00:39:52.760]   are the same, it's too expensive per user.
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:55.040]   And you can't require people to buy an Xbox,
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:57.680]   it's not gonna work, it's not gonna happen.
[00:39:57.680 --> 00:39:58.880]   - Okay, great, thank you, Major Nelson.
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:39:59.920]   How about you Veronica?
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:01.720]   What are your picks for this,
[00:40:01.720 --> 00:40:04.080]   the most interesting stuff you saw at,
[00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:05.500]   you were there, I should mention,
[00:40:05.500 --> 00:40:08.280]   little disclaimer, you work for Sony now with the core.
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:10.480]   - I don't technically work for Sony.
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:12.600]   I work for a third party that produces core.
[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:14.600]   So, Sony doesn't pay my paychecks or anything,
[00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:17.560]   but yes, I do report on Sony products.
[00:40:17.560 --> 00:40:19.520]   - And core is available how?
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:21.600]   - Core is available over the PSN.
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:25.600]   So you download it like a game or something like that.
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:29.680]   - Yeah, so you fire up your PS3 and you go online
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:31.120]   and you could find core.
[00:40:31.120 --> 00:40:33.080]   Q-O-R-E.
[00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:34.600]   - Q-O-R-E, that's right, yeah.
[00:40:34.600 --> 00:40:37.880]   So we've got movies and TV shows now on the PSN too.
[00:40:37.880 --> 00:40:39.680]   So that's pretty exciting, they just announced that
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:42.200]   and it became available the night at the keynote.
[00:40:42.200 --> 00:40:44.640]   I'm kind of really excited for a little big planet.
[00:40:44.640 --> 00:40:47.000]   I have to say, I finally got some hands-on time with it
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.240]   and it is even more mind-blowing than I possibly am at.
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:51.880]   - Tell us about it, what is it?
[00:40:51.880 --> 00:40:54.440]   - Oh dude, it's like, I don't even really know
[00:40:54.440 --> 00:40:56.280]   how to describe it if you haven't seen it.
[00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:58.200]   The video doesn't do it justice.
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:40:59.680]   I'll just say that there's one part
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:02.240]   that I had never seen before where you can actually take
[00:41:02.240 --> 00:41:05.800]   an inanimate object like a block with a wheel on it
[00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:08.320]   and then you stick a brain on top of it
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:10.040]   and suddenly it's alive.
[00:41:10.040 --> 00:41:12.960]   - Either chase you around or be good or evil
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:13.800]   and you kind of--
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:14.640]   - Is it a platformer?
[00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:15.720]   I mean, it looks like a platformer.
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:18.000]   You know, like the 2D Mario type games
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:19.680]   where you're running around in an environment
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:21.600]   and jumping and--
[00:41:21.600 --> 00:41:23.600]   - It's kind of 2D but also kind of not
[00:41:23.600 --> 00:41:25.440]   because you can still move from the foreground
[00:41:25.440 --> 00:41:27.320]   to the background at the same time.
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:30.160]   You're not like, it's not totally 3D kind of experience
[00:41:30.160 --> 00:41:32.520]   but you can definitely move around within the space.
[00:41:32.520 --> 00:41:36.040]   - It feels like a kind of Mario 21st century kind of.
[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:36.960]   (laughs)
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:37.800]   Is that right?
[00:41:37.800 --> 00:41:39.760]   - It's cool, you can take pictures of the whole screen
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:42.720]   and make them stickers so you can stick on other objects.
[00:41:42.720 --> 00:41:43.560]   - Interesting.
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:47.280]   - And a lot of puzzles, is there a lot of logic involved?
[00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:49.280]   - Yeah, especially when you're building the levels too
[00:41:49.280 --> 00:41:50.800]   'cause you have to really work with the physics
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:52.520]   that are built into the game.
[00:41:52.520 --> 00:41:54.760]   The physics engine is just incredible too.
[00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:56.200]   - So it's not just a Twitch game,
[00:41:56.200 --> 00:41:58.400]   it's not about jumping fast and remembering
[00:41:58.400 --> 00:41:59.560]   where you're going and all that stuff.
[00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:01.200]   You actually have to think a little bit.
[00:42:01.200 --> 00:42:02.720]   - You have to think you have to kind of build it
[00:42:02.720 --> 00:42:04.280]   the way that you want it to be played.
[00:42:04.280 --> 00:42:07.080]   I mean, you can download the separate levels from online
[00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:09.960]   and play other people's levels and pick your favorites
[00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:11.280]   and share them amongst your friends.
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:13.280]   - People build levels, is that it?
[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:14.760]   I mean, is that an integral part of the game
[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:16.760]   or is it just an additional thing you can do build levels?
[00:42:16.760 --> 00:42:18.080]   I mean, games have been coming out for years
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:19.120]   building levels, do people really do that?
[00:42:19.120 --> 00:42:20.200]   - It's definitely an integral part.
[00:42:20.200 --> 00:42:22.000]   I think people are kind of going nuts about it.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:22.840]   - Okay.
[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:23.680]   - Yeah.
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:24.520]   - I think that's gonna be a huge part.
[00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:27.160]   I mean, it taps into that whole Sims mentality almost.
[00:42:27.160 --> 00:42:29.280]   That whole kind of the same thing we're seeing
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:32.040]   with Spore right now is that people just love
[00:42:32.040 --> 00:42:33.520]   the creation aspect of it.
[00:42:33.520 --> 00:42:35.520]   I mean, we have the creature creator for Spore
[00:42:35.520 --> 00:42:36.920]   and people are just having a blast.
[00:42:36.920 --> 00:42:37.920]   - That's all you can do.
[00:42:37.920 --> 00:42:39.560]   - Right for now.
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:41.720]   What I'm saying is that's almost as much of a part
[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:43.920]   of the game as anything else.
[00:42:43.920 --> 00:42:46.920]   I mean, so yeah, little big plan is definitely gonna be
[00:42:46.920 --> 00:42:48.080]   a huge hit.
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:50.320]   I think I'm gonna spend an awful lot of time in that one.
[00:42:50.320 --> 00:42:51.360]   - It looks, I mean, I have to say,
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:53.160]   just the videos look incredible.
[00:42:53.160 --> 00:42:54.680]   I mean, it looks really like it.
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:56.640]   Is it PS3 only?
[00:42:56.640 --> 00:42:57.480]   - Yes.
[00:42:57.480 --> 00:42:58.320]   - Okay.
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:42:59.840]   So there is an exclusive on that one.
[00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:01.200]   - And then what else we had?
[00:43:01.200 --> 00:43:02.920]   We had Resistance 2, looked really cool.
[00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:05.400]   I saw more footage of that that I hadn't seen before.
[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:07.600]   I'm looking forward to that one.
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:10.120]   I mean, I didn't know how I was feeling about it.
[00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:13.240]   Initially, I didn't play Fall of Man all that much.
[00:43:13.240 --> 00:43:16.440]   So it wasn't something that I was totally looking forward to,
[00:43:16.440 --> 00:43:18.560]   but now that I've actually seen more gameplay footage
[00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:20.400]   and I've talked to their developers,
[00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:22.760]   it looks pretty sick, for sure.
[00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:24.320]   - That was a good looking title.
[00:43:24.320 --> 00:43:27.000]   - Yeah, that was the only title.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:28.480]   (laughs)
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:30.640]   - Oh, you got PS3 here, Resistance.
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:33.760]   - And then we have this other game, Mag,
[00:43:33.760 --> 00:43:35.520]   which I'm not even positive if that's gonna be
[00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:38.120]   the final title of this game,
[00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:42.600]   but it's 256 online players at once.
[00:43:42.600 --> 00:43:46.360]   So it's a massive action game is what they're calling it.
[00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:48.760]   And that's kind of blowing my mind right now.
[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:52.080]   - But it's not an MMO because you're not in a open universe.
[00:43:52.080 --> 00:43:54.000]   There's only 256 players at once.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.280]   So it's kind of somewhere in between,
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:58.000]   say, Unreal Tournament and Warcraft.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.600]   - Right, it is squad based.
[00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:01.640]   So you'll be playing within a smaller squad
[00:44:01.640 --> 00:44:04.400]   and kind of controlling your different units
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:06.240]   and then playing towards a common goal
[00:44:06.240 --> 00:44:08.600]   with the other people on your side.
[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:10.000]   - So is that a new category,
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:12.640]   the idea of a massive action game?
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:13.840]   - Massive action game.
[00:44:13.840 --> 00:44:16.800]   I think, well, there have been, well, I guess so.
[00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:18.840]   I mean, anyone else want to chime in on that one?
[00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:20.520]   I can't really think of what else would be considered
[00:44:20.520 --> 00:44:24.720]   a massive action game, maybe Tablerosa?
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:26.160]   I guess that's kind of close.
[00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:28.240]   - Yeah, that's what I'm thinking as well.
[00:44:28.240 --> 00:44:29.640]   I don't know if it's a new category,
[00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:32.080]   but what we're seeing is because,
[00:44:32.080 --> 00:44:33.560]   you know, we've got such powerful hardware,
[00:44:33.560 --> 00:44:36.600]   the generation is that developers are able to do this
[00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:38.360]   and turn up the crank a little bit
[00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:40.080]   and more and more and more and more and more players,
[00:44:40.080 --> 00:44:40.920]   bigger maps, etc.
[00:44:40.920 --> 00:44:42.440]   - That's interesting.
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:46.400]   So we do, there's been such a leap in power
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:49.400]   with the Xbox 360 and the PS3.
[00:44:49.400 --> 00:44:52.120]   And all that's happened so far really
[00:44:52.120 --> 00:44:53.960]   is games have looked better.
[00:44:53.960 --> 00:44:55.000]   Where else can you go with that?
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.160]   I think maybe this is an interesting place to go.
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:44:58.800]   - Well, I think that's one place they're going.
[00:44:58.800 --> 00:44:59.920]   The other place they're going,
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:03.040]   which was a theme, this show is a lot of folks
[00:45:03.040 --> 00:45:06.280]   who are talking about co-op is the new multiplayer.
[00:45:06.280 --> 00:45:08.680]   - Co-op as in Team Fortress kind of or?
[00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:11.280]   - Co-op as in you and I team up
[00:45:11.280 --> 00:45:13.760]   to work our way through the campaign of a game.
[00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:15.080]   - Yeah.
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:16.200]   - That was big in Halo, wasn't it?
[00:45:16.200 --> 00:45:18.080]   I think a lot of people play Halo that way.
[00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:19.080]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:45:19.080 --> 00:45:21.720]   And I know that a lot of the games that I saw,
[00:45:21.720 --> 00:45:25.080]   I believe resistance is going to do that, right Veronica?
[00:45:25.080 --> 00:45:27.920]   - There's going to be, I think there's eight person co-op.
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:28.760]   - Wow.
[00:45:28.760 --> 00:45:29.600]   - In that one and so--
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:31.160]   - And social gaming again, isn't it?
[00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:34.200]   You and your buddies go online and play a game together.
[00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:35.960]   - Yeah, the way we look at it, you know,
[00:45:35.960 --> 00:45:39.360]   Microsoft is we call the us versus them mentality.
[00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:41.680]   Us meaning I get a group of people together
[00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:44.240]   and we go again to them and them could be other people
[00:45:44.240 --> 00:45:47.680]   or bots, the AI, whatever, but it's,
[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:50.320]   we're basically having experience
[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:51.840]   against another group of folks.
[00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:53.040]   - Is AI getting better?
[00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:55.760]   'Cause AI's traditionally been just got awful.
[00:45:55.760 --> 00:45:56.600]   - I think it is.
[00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:59.400]   That's a place you could use as power.
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:01.560]   When I play MGS4, I saw better AI.
[00:46:01.560 --> 00:46:02.720]   I think it's getting a little better.
[00:46:02.720 --> 00:46:04.200]   I think it could obviously get a lot better.
[00:46:04.200 --> 00:46:08.800]   And no one, another great game that goes to recon.
[00:46:08.800 --> 00:46:11.680]   Or goes to recon, I think it, Rainbow Six, Vegas 2.
[00:46:11.680 --> 00:46:13.640]   I'm thinking that, you know, that has better AI too.
[00:46:13.640 --> 00:46:15.240]   And I think it is getting better,
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:16.280]   but it has a long way to go.
[00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:18.640]   - Well, I wonder if there's less incentive to do it
[00:46:18.640 --> 00:46:21.000]   since you're doing so many online gaming now.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:24.240]   Why make the AI better when you can always find a human
[00:46:24.240 --> 00:46:26.080]   to provide the intelligence on the other end?
[00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:27.480]   - To Veronica's point earlier,
[00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:29.800]   maybe some of those people you really don't want to play with.
[00:46:29.800 --> 00:46:31.360]   (laughing)
[00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:32.200]   - Well, that's the thing.
[00:46:32.200 --> 00:46:33.000]   I mean, call me old school,
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:34.400]   but I still like to play offline.
[00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:35.240]   I really do.
[00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:36.080]   I enjoy playing offline.
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:37.600]   If having a buddy over, we're playing together.
[00:46:37.600 --> 00:46:39.480]   You know, I like being in the room together,
[00:46:39.480 --> 00:46:40.480]   doing something together.
[00:46:40.480 --> 00:46:42.760]   - Is that a generational thing?
[00:46:42.760 --> 00:46:43.760]   - Probably.
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:44.600]   - I want it.
[00:46:44.600 --> 00:46:46.280]   - I mean, I watch my son play.
[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:48.480]   He's really, he will play with his buddies,
[00:46:48.480 --> 00:46:51.040]   but they're not with him, they're at home.
[00:46:51.040 --> 00:46:52.520]   And, you know, there'll be a couple of them
[00:46:52.520 --> 00:46:55.480]   in a room with 20 other guys they don't know.
[00:46:55.480 --> 00:46:57.440]   - I feel like it's a lot harder.
[00:46:57.440 --> 00:46:58.520]   It's harder to play with someone else
[00:46:58.520 --> 00:47:01.840]   in the room these days on a console than it ever has been,
[00:47:01.840 --> 00:47:04.480]   especially for a lot of the first person shooters
[00:47:04.480 --> 00:47:05.640]   and that kind of thing, split screen
[00:47:05.640 --> 00:47:06.680]   just doesn't really cut it
[00:47:06.680 --> 00:47:08.560]   unless you're doing something like,
[00:47:08.560 --> 00:47:09.400]   - It's true.
[00:47:09.400 --> 00:47:10.240]   - I don't know.
[00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:11.880]   It's just, you don't make it as you see any more to play.
[00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:15.240]   - Like, Veronica, you grew up with having everything together.
[00:47:15.240 --> 00:47:16.560]   Or not a once-a-a-shoe, you wanna think,
[00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:17.560]   there's a generation of people
[00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:19.560]   that have had this high depth experience.
[00:47:19.560 --> 00:47:21.720]   Like, I remember playing the, you know,
[00:47:21.720 --> 00:47:23.960]   the Intellivision on split screen,
[00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:25.160]   which is so miserable.
[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:27.760]   - You and I must be a similar age than Mary Juneaus.
[00:47:27.760 --> 00:47:29.600]   (laughing)
[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:31.840]   Oh, those are really good old days.
[00:47:31.840 --> 00:47:33.760]   - People don't wanna give up,
[00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:35.600]   they're had their beautiful HD display
[00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:39.040]   and they don't really wanna share it with anybody else.
[00:47:39.040 --> 00:47:40.200]   - I remember games when the only
[00:47:40.200 --> 00:47:42.080]   control you had was a knob.
[00:47:42.080 --> 00:47:42.920]   (laughing)
[00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:43.760]   You could turn it up.
[00:47:43.760 --> 00:47:44.760]   - Video game layout?
[00:47:44.760 --> 00:47:45.600]   - Yeah.
[00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:46.600]   (laughing)
[00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:47.960]   It's all kinds.
[00:47:47.960 --> 00:47:49.760]   - So-- - It's funny.
[00:47:49.760 --> 00:47:51.120]   - My cousin, sorry Leo.
[00:47:51.120 --> 00:47:52.320]   My cousin who is at my house today,
[00:47:52.320 --> 00:47:53.600]   he's in from North Carolina
[00:47:53.600 --> 00:47:55.280]   and he's about 10 years younger than me.
[00:47:55.280 --> 00:47:56.120]   And we're playing there and he goes,
[00:47:56.120 --> 00:47:57.280]   "Hey, you wanna play Call of Duty 4?"
[00:47:57.280 --> 00:47:59.040]   Well, I'm boycotting first person sure, so I can't.
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:01.800]   But no, no, but no, so we're playing there
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:03.840]   and he says, "I said, would you ever play
[00:48:03.840 --> 00:48:04.920]   "with your buddies at your house?"
[00:48:04.920 --> 00:48:05.960]   He goes, "No, that's stupid.
[00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:06.800]   "That's boring.
[00:48:06.800 --> 00:48:07.640]   "What are you thinking?"
[00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:09.120]   He goes, "No, I play with all my friends
[00:48:09.120 --> 00:48:09.960]   "that are at their own house.
[00:48:09.960 --> 00:48:11.160]   "I let we do it from home."
[00:48:11.160 --> 00:48:13.520]   And I guess that is a generational thing.
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:14.360]   It's amazing.
[00:48:14.360 --> 00:48:15.200]   I mean, these guys, he said,
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:16.040]   "We never play together.
[00:48:16.040 --> 00:48:17.040]   "That's boring to play together.
[00:48:17.040 --> 00:48:17.880]   "We don't like that.
[00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:22.600]   "We wanna play or, you know, nowhere near each other."
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:23.440]   I don't know.
[00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:24.280]   I think it's clear though,
[00:48:24.280 --> 00:48:25.120]   I mean, that social gaming,
[00:48:25.120 --> 00:48:26.760]   whether it's side by side, social gaming
[00:48:26.760 --> 00:48:30.360]   or online social gaming is really where this is happening.
[00:48:30.360 --> 00:48:32.480]   Even Spore has a social element,
[00:48:32.480 --> 00:48:34.280]   although it's not an MMO.
[00:48:34.280 --> 00:48:35.520]   No.
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:36.880]   What does he call it?
[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:38.800]   Massively single player.
[00:48:38.800 --> 00:48:39.640]   Single player?
[00:48:39.640 --> 00:48:41.440]   Yeah, massively single player, I think.
[00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:42.720]   Did you get a chance to play any Spore
[00:48:42.720 --> 00:48:44.040]   while you were there in Veronica?
[00:48:44.040 --> 00:48:46.080]   I did not get my, get a chance to see Spore
[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:47.840]   while I was there actually.
[00:48:47.840 --> 00:48:49.720]   I played a lot of Fallout 3 though.
[00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:50.560]   That's gonna be fun.
[00:48:50.560 --> 00:48:51.400]   Love Fallout.
[00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:52.960]   Love Fallout.
[00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:53.960]   Oh man.
[00:48:53.960 --> 00:48:54.800]   People are giving it crap
[00:48:54.800 --> 00:48:56.680]   because it's not the same kind of, you know,
[00:48:56.680 --> 00:48:58.680]   perspective as the past Fallout's,
[00:48:58.680 --> 00:49:00.920]   but I think it's brilliant.
[00:49:00.920 --> 00:49:01.760]   Interesting.
[00:49:01.760 --> 00:49:03.800]   I think it's gonna be really fun to play.
[00:49:03.800 --> 00:49:05.760]   Anything else you were excited about?
[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:10.400]   No, I think that's about it.
[00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:12.080]   Anything for the Wii that got you going?
[00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:14.920]   Any Wii, was there any Wii announcements at all?
[00:49:14.920 --> 00:49:16.640]   Oh dude, I played that Wii music game.
[00:49:16.640 --> 00:49:18.000]   It was so annoying.
[00:49:18.000 --> 00:49:20.200]   (laughing)
[00:49:20.200 --> 00:49:21.040]   Okay.
[00:49:21.040 --> 00:49:23.280]   Like the little man with the dog suit on going,
[00:49:23.280 --> 00:49:25.240]   (dog barking)
[00:49:25.240 --> 00:49:26.080]   It's like really?
[00:49:26.080 --> 00:49:26.920]   A dog suit?
[00:49:26.920 --> 00:49:27.760]   Okay, awesome.
[00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:30.000]   This kind of bears out what you were saying Don,
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.920]   which is that the Wii, people buy the hardware,
[00:49:32.920 --> 00:49:34.560]   but I've always thought this too,
[00:49:34.560 --> 00:49:35.880]   that the Wii is the kind of thing
[00:49:35.880 --> 00:49:38.480]   that somebody who doesn't like games buys
[00:49:38.480 --> 00:49:41.040]   and plays it for like a week or month.
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:43.080]   And then it's like collecting dust.
[00:49:43.080 --> 00:49:43.920]   Never played again.
[00:49:43.920 --> 00:49:44.760]   I mean, here's the thing.
[00:49:44.760 --> 00:49:47.160]   And I was my, well, I guess she's my fiance.
[00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:48.960]   I get a hate mail when I say that, by the way.
[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:50.680]   And I know I'm gonna get hate mail again.
[00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:52.000]   Tell me about it.
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:54.400]   So we had, we fit that, you know, Nintendo sent it,
[00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:55.640]   like, oh, you guys gotta play this, whatever.
[00:49:55.640 --> 00:49:57.680]   So we play and I'm like 35, whatever.
[00:49:57.680 --> 00:49:59.280]   And I'm like, oh man, I gotta work this hard
[00:49:59.280 --> 00:50:01.200]   to, you know, get down to whatever.
[00:50:01.200 --> 00:50:02.320]   And so my girlfriend gets on it
[00:50:02.320 --> 00:50:05.120]   and she goes, she does the whole balance thing.
[00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:06.640]   Yeah, thank you, thank you.
[00:50:06.640 --> 00:50:07.840]   She might shoot me for that.
[00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:09.600]   So, and she's like 20 years old.
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:10.640]   And she doesn't have to do anything.
[00:50:10.640 --> 00:50:11.720]   I'm thinking to myself, well,
[00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:12.840]   how are we gonna play this now?
[00:50:12.840 --> 00:50:13.640]   And so we never play it.
[00:50:13.640 --> 00:50:14.680]   So she's, you know, she's fine.
[00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:17.680]   And so I think that myself, is this what all these things are?
[00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:18.960]   Because I never really wanna play the Wii.
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:19.960]   She goes, hey, why don't we play the Wii?
[00:50:19.960 --> 00:50:22.160]   We can play tennis or whatever on the Wii Sports.
[00:50:22.160 --> 00:50:23.000]   And that's what I find.
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   I find that we play Wii Sports.
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.720]   And then if I wanna have a laugh and do awful at Wii Fit
[00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:27.840]   and, you know, she can show me up,
[00:50:27.840 --> 00:50:28.680]   then we'll play Wii Fit.
[00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:30.760]   But yeah, it doesn't really, you don't play games in the Wii.
[00:50:30.760 --> 00:50:31.960]   It's kind of weird.
[00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:33.040]   Even Super Mario Galaxy.
[00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:34.280]   I didn't really think that was like great.
[00:50:34.280 --> 00:50:35.120]   I played it for a while.
[00:50:35.120 --> 00:50:36.360]   I said, well, okay, that's fun.
[00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:37.200]   You know, but I'm done.
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:38.720]   - I kinda like the Rayman.
[00:50:38.720 --> 00:50:45.720]   - Yeah, okay, yeah, I played that a couple times.
[00:50:45.720 --> 00:50:46.720]   I like Rayman.
[00:50:46.720 --> 00:50:47.720]   - I get a kick out of Rayman.
[00:50:47.720 --> 00:50:48.720]   - Rayman's team.
[00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:49.720]   - Oh, yeah, people are mentioning in the chat room,
[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:50.720]   "God of War 3 coming out.
[00:50:50.720 --> 00:50:52.720]   We've got, you know, resistance on the PSP.
[00:50:52.720 --> 00:50:53.720]   That's gonna be pretty cool."
[00:50:53.720 --> 00:50:54.720]   I don't actually own a PSP right now.
[00:50:54.720 --> 00:50:55.720]   I haven't worked, but I haven't brought one around with me.
[00:50:55.720 --> 00:50:57.720]   - Let's talk about portable gaming, the DS or the PSP.
[00:50:57.720 --> 00:50:58.720]   Anything interesting there?
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:01.720]   - I did GTA on the DS, if you're into that.
[00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:03.720]   That was a little, that was an interesting angle.
[00:51:03.720 --> 00:51:04.720]   - Was it like GTA 4?
[00:51:04.720 --> 00:51:05.720]   - Yeah.
[00:51:05.720 --> 00:51:09.720]   - Is it like GTA 4?
[00:51:09.720 --> 00:51:13.720]   - Veronica, how would you describe that?
[00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:14.720]   - What's that again?
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:16.720]   - GTA on the DS?
[00:51:16.720 --> 00:51:17.720]   - I haven't seen that.
[00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:18.720]   I wasn't any three.
[00:51:18.720 --> 00:51:20.720]   I didn't see it, so I can't really comment.
[00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:22.720]   But I imagine it's not going to be anything like--
[00:51:22.720 --> 00:51:23.720]   - It can't really, yeah.
[00:51:23.720 --> 00:51:27.720]   I mean, one of the things that makes GTA 4 so interesting is how open it is
[00:51:27.720 --> 00:51:30.720]   and how realistic it is.
[00:51:30.720 --> 00:51:31.720]   But it's not top-down.
[00:51:31.720 --> 00:51:33.720]   It's not like the old GTA 1, is it?
[00:51:33.720 --> 00:51:36.720]   I mean, it's not Spy Hunter 3.
[00:51:36.720 --> 00:51:38.720]   - No, it's not like that.
[00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:42.720]   So I mean, that's one that was certainly vaguely interesting.
[00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:43.720]   - Yeah.
[00:51:43.720 --> 00:51:47.720]   - But yeah, I think the big news in the portable space was got a war come in.
[00:51:47.720 --> 00:51:48.720]   - Right.
[00:51:48.720 --> 00:51:49.720]   - We got a board, we talked about that.
[00:51:49.720 --> 00:51:50.720]   - That's a fun game.
[00:51:50.720 --> 00:52:00.720]   - But I also want to point out that one, I think one of the big PS thing for PSP owners is the fact that you're going to be able to purchase movies on the PlayStation store and then copy them over your PSP.
[00:52:00.720 --> 00:52:01.720]   - Yeah, right.
[00:52:01.720 --> 00:52:02.720]   That's pretty great.
[00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:03.720]   - Yeah, that's going to be huge.
[00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:04.720]   - I thought that was really--
[00:52:04.720 --> 00:52:07.720]   - I'm curious to see how that's going to ultimately work out, but that led to me as potential.
[00:52:07.720 --> 00:52:09.720]   - Oh, you know what else I forgot to talk about?
[00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:14.720]   The DCO of the DC Universe Online, which is going to be really, really fun.
[00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:21.720]   I played a little bit of it early, early on in the game and making your own superheroes and getting to fight against Batman.
[00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:22.720]   Awesome.
[00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:23.720]   Awesome.
[00:52:23.720 --> 00:52:26.720]   So we'll see how that works out against Warcraft.
[00:52:26.720 --> 00:52:28.720]   - How many of you have seen Dark Knight?
[00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:29.720]   - Oh, went to see it yesterday.
[00:52:29.720 --> 00:52:30.720]   - Haven't seen it.
[00:52:30.720 --> 00:52:31.720]   - I have seen it.
[00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:32.720]   - Major Nelson.
[00:52:32.720 --> 00:52:33.720]   - All right, so have you seen Dark Knight?
[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:34.720]   - I unfortunately haven't seen it yet either.
[00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:35.720]   Been a little burned out.
[00:52:35.720 --> 00:52:37.720]   - He's no spoilers, Don, but it was good, huh?
[00:52:37.720 --> 00:52:42.320]   - Well, here's my thing, and I kind of got killed on Twitter for this.
[00:52:42.320 --> 00:52:43.320]   And here's the thing.
[00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:44.320]   First act, unbelievable.
[00:52:44.320 --> 00:52:45.320]   I give it an 11 out of 10.
[00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:46.320]   Not even a 10 out of 10.
[00:52:46.320 --> 00:52:47.880]   It's an 11 out of 10.
[00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:51.120]   And then we go into the second act, and I think it kind of fell apart on me.
[00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:54.160]   I'm just going to, you know, did you see it, Leo?
[00:52:54.160 --> 00:52:55.160]   - No.
[00:52:55.160 --> 00:52:58.680]   - Okay, well, I'm just going to tell you right now that when Batman talks, and he's not Bruce
[00:52:58.680 --> 00:52:59.680]   Wainbaw, when Batman--
[00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:00.680]   - He lives.
[00:53:00.680 --> 00:53:02.000]   - Oh, and a noise, he's a cable guy.
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   Ever seen the movie cable guy?
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   - Yeah.
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:05.000]   - Blah, blah, blah, blah.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:07.560]   Don't want to hear anymore about the movie.
[00:53:07.560 --> 00:53:09.600]   - Don't spoil it for me.
[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:10.600]   - 8 out of 10.
[00:53:10.600 --> 00:53:11.600]   That's what I give it.
[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:12.600]   8 out of 10.
[00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:13.600]   - That's a pretty good one.
[00:53:13.600 --> 00:53:16.400]   That's a pretty good one, I have to say.
[00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:17.400]   I'm excited to see it.
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:18.400]   - I'm going to go see it.
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:19.400]   I can't wait to see it.
[00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:20.400]   No spoilers.
[00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:22.560]   All right, Don, what were the highlights of E3?
[00:53:22.560 --> 00:53:27.920]   You weren't there, but what were you seeing from your lair, your eerie?
[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:30.520]   - Looking down upon the E3 crowds.
[00:53:30.520 --> 00:53:34.280]   - No, I mean, I look at it, and I think we pretty much covered it all.
[00:53:34.280 --> 00:53:37.720]   I mean, obviously, Gears of War II and Resident Evil 5.
[00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:39.720]   I don't know if we mentioned that, but that's one of those things.
[00:53:39.720 --> 00:53:42.480]   I can feel kind of hypocritical because I say that it's all derivative, and then I'm
[00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:44.120]   talking about these follow-ups.
[00:53:44.120 --> 00:53:46.320]   - Well, all we could talk about is sequels, really.
[00:53:46.320 --> 00:53:52.080]   I mean, that's why when you say a little big planet and spore, that gets a lot of attention.
[00:53:52.080 --> 00:53:53.600]   These are innovative new games.
[00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:55.640]   - Anybody talk about Diablo 3 there?
[00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:57.240]   I thought that was a great-- I love the trailer.
[00:53:57.240 --> 00:53:58.800]   I can't wait to see Diablo 3.
[00:53:58.800 --> 00:53:59.800]   That's going to be awesome.
[00:53:59.800 --> 00:54:01.640]   - Yeah, I'm looking forward to playing that one too.
[00:54:01.640 --> 00:54:03.400]   - 2010, probably, knowing.
[00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:07.560]   - We talked about this a little bit earlier, but I mentioned PC gaming, but I thought it
[00:54:07.560 --> 00:54:09.560]   was woefully underrepresented.
[00:54:09.560 --> 00:54:16.800]   - Yeah, because at Diablo 3's PC game, StarCraft 2 was Blizzard there at all?
[00:54:16.800 --> 00:54:17.960]   - I did not see them.
[00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:18.960]   - Interesting.
[00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:21.760]   - I didn't see them either, and I think I was just so busy that I didn't think about
[00:54:21.760 --> 00:54:27.200]   it, but I think everything was kind of announced at the Paris Invitational, and I think it was
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:30.360]   a great deal, and then I hadn't been thinking about it too much since then, unfortunately.
[00:54:30.360 --> 00:54:32.000]   I'm kind of taking a while break.
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:33.480]   - I haven't been out for a long time.
[00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:35.400]   - Duke Nukem looked great, didn't it?
[00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:36.400]   (laughter)
[00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:38.320]   - I didn't see that one yet.
[00:54:38.320 --> 00:54:40.000]   - Any day now.
[00:54:40.000 --> 00:54:42.000]   (laughter)
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:43.800]   It's a good trailer.
[00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:46.560]   They probably took it four years to make the trailer.
[00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:49.040]   - Let's get a leisure suit Larry, 2010.
[00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:51.400]   - Oh, yeah, we're ready for that.
[00:54:51.400 --> 00:54:52.400]   You know, that reminds me.
[00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:55.600]   I haven't had, what's his name on the show on a while?
[00:54:55.600 --> 00:54:56.600]   We should get him back on.
[00:54:56.600 --> 00:54:59.760]   He doesn't do a leisure suit Larry anymore.
[00:54:59.760 --> 00:55:01.120]   Don Lowe, what is his name?
[00:55:01.120 --> 00:55:03.120]   Don, I can't remember.
[00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:06.080]   He's gonna be yelling at me.
[00:55:06.080 --> 00:55:10.360]   Let's see, so what else, anything else Don that you want to talk about from E3, or have
[00:55:10.360 --> 00:55:11.360]   we wrapped it up?
[00:55:11.360 --> 00:55:12.360]   - I don't know.
[00:55:12.360 --> 00:55:14.280]   I don't have much to ask that, so I guess so.
[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:18.760]   - Couple other stories in the news, and we're gonna get to those just a little bit,
[00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:23.760]   but first, I want to say hello to audible.com, my good friends at Audible who sponsor this
[00:55:23.760 --> 00:55:24.760]   show.
[00:55:24.760 --> 00:55:27.760]   We're gonna get to watch with their support, A-U-D-I-B-L-E.com.
[00:55:27.760 --> 00:55:34.480]   If you go to audible.com/twit, you can get a free book.
[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:37.560]   And we got a special thing.
[00:55:37.560 --> 00:55:40.240]   You might be interested in this Veronica for Sword and Laser.
[00:55:40.240 --> 00:55:41.240]   - Ooh.
[00:55:41.240 --> 00:55:42.760]   - A free book, free free.
[00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:44.720]   You don't like no cost at all.
[00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:47.480]   Anybody, even if you're already an audible member.
[00:55:47.480 --> 00:55:49.040]   How do you like that?
[00:55:49.040 --> 00:55:50.880]   - That sounds like my kind of job.
[00:55:50.880 --> 00:55:51.880]   - It's a special offer.
[00:55:51.880 --> 00:55:59.240]   I've never read any of Christine, Catherine Rush's stuff, but her newest, the Disappeared,
[00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:05.360]   is free if you go to audible.com/thedisappeared.
[00:56:05.360 --> 00:56:07.040]   You can download it, even if you're already a member.
[00:56:07.040 --> 00:56:10.640]   So the idea is for those of you who have not listened to a book or maybe you've been holding
[00:56:10.640 --> 00:56:15.880]   off or are audible members but haven't listened in a while, she wrote a number of, I think,
[00:56:15.880 --> 00:56:19.000]   very good Star Trek adaptations.
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:26.640]   This is part of a series, or a retrieval artist series that sounds very interesting.
[00:56:26.640 --> 00:56:32.840]   Retrieval artists help the lost find their way back home whether they like it or not.
[00:56:32.840 --> 00:56:38.880]   Specialized private detectives, they investigate the most unusual crimes in the galaxy.
[00:56:38.880 --> 00:56:41.400]   So it sounds, you know, it sounds like an interesting story.
[00:56:41.400 --> 00:56:44.480]   I asked people on Twitter, I mentioned this on Twitter, I said, "Is anybody read any of
[00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:45.480]   her stuff?"
[00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:46.480]   People said, "Yeah, she's great.
[00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:47.480]   You got to read this."
[00:56:47.480 --> 00:56:49.360]   It's a little dystopian, I'm told.
[00:56:49.360 --> 00:56:52.880]   It's book one of the retrieval artists series, "The Disappeared."
[00:56:52.880 --> 00:56:54.680]   It's free.
[00:56:54.680 --> 00:56:59.240]   Free as in beer, free as in download it now whether you're an Audible member or not.
[00:56:59.240 --> 00:57:06.000]   A-U-D-I-B-L-E.com/THEDISAPERED.
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:07.680]   You have to know how to spell to get this one.
[00:57:07.680 --> 00:57:10.760]   Or you can always use the regular offer audible.com/twit.
[00:57:10.760 --> 00:57:11.760]   But I thought this would be a good one.
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:12.760]   You can do both.
[00:57:12.760 --> 00:57:14.960]   Get two free books.
[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:16.880]   "The Disappeared" by Christine Catherine.
[00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:19.280]   I'll play a little bit of it just to give you a...
[00:57:19.280 --> 00:57:22.920]   The third body has to be somewhere else, to reach you said.
[00:57:22.920 --> 00:57:24.400]   I vote for the cockpit.
[00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:26.960]   Flint said, "We have to go there anyway.
[00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:29.680]   I want to find out when those pods were ejected."
[00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:31.480]   To reach you glanced at him.
[00:57:31.480 --> 00:57:33.640]   The pods don't fit, do they?
[00:57:33.640 --> 00:57:35.360]   Not with a distant venture skill.
[00:57:35.360 --> 00:57:38.680]   Jay Snyder is one of the best readers and they do some great science fiction with him.
[00:57:38.680 --> 00:57:39.920]   He's really good.
[00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:43.360]   Do you ever do audiobooks on Sword and Laser Pointer?
[00:57:43.360 --> 00:57:45.360]   I'm sorry.
[00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:46.920]   You just had to.
[00:57:46.920 --> 00:57:47.920]   I love doing that.
[00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:52.720]   You've just been waiting to use that for a lot.
[00:57:52.720 --> 00:57:55.400]   I remember the Sword and Laser Pointer.
[00:57:55.400 --> 00:57:56.400]   It's a really...
[00:57:56.400 --> 00:57:57.400]   No, the Sword and Laser...
[00:57:57.400 --> 00:58:00.040]   We have not done specifically audio yet.
[00:58:00.040 --> 00:58:02.480]   I think that's kind of limiting in our show.
[00:58:02.480 --> 00:58:05.400]   What you can do is when you do a regular book, mention the audio version of it.
[00:58:05.400 --> 00:58:08.560]   I'll tell you why, because a lot of people aren't going to find the time to read the
[00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:09.760]   book, but when you have an odd...
[00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:13.280]   And many of your books, even Watership Down, excuse me.
[00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:14.280]   Yes.
[00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:17.120]   Even Watership Down have audio versions on Audible.com.
[00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:21.520]   So it's a good way, if you are a member of Sword and Laser, which is a really neat site
[00:58:21.520 --> 00:58:27.520]   and a chance to kind of have a book group around science fiction and fantasy stuff,
[00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:28.520]   that is a good way to do it.
[00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:30.240]   I just thought I'd throw that in there.
[00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:31.920]   Audible.com/twit.
[00:58:31.920 --> 00:58:34.160]   If you want to get a free book, join Audible today.
[00:58:34.160 --> 00:58:40.720]   And even if you're already a member, if you just go to Audible.com/TheDisappeared and
[00:58:40.720 --> 00:58:42.760]   you can get a free copy of this book.
[00:58:42.760 --> 00:58:46.680]   Audible is going to start doing this, I think, from time to time as a way of getting people...
[00:58:46.680 --> 00:58:51.360]   I think they need to do a little outreach to get people to understand why it's so cool
[00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:54.280]   to have an audio book version.
[00:58:54.280 --> 00:58:55.280]   It's just...
[00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:56.920]   You know, Leo, it's funny.
[00:58:56.920 --> 00:58:57.920]   Unaudible.
[00:58:57.920 --> 00:59:02.560]   I downloaded this great lecture by David McCulloch from John Adams fame.
[00:59:02.560 --> 00:59:03.560]   Oh, I love him.
[00:59:03.560 --> 00:59:04.560]   It's like that.
[00:59:04.560 --> 00:59:05.560]   It's called The Course of Human Events.
[00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:06.920]   I looked it up, it's still on there.
[00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:08.760]   So, a great, great lecture.
[00:59:08.760 --> 00:59:13.000]   It talks about all the things going on with the Founding Fathers during that time.
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.000]   Fantastic, if you want to check it out.
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:16.000]   It's not too long.
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:21.120]   It's like 38, 39 minutes long, I think it said, but definitely worth the free coupon.
[00:59:21.120 --> 00:59:22.120]   Okay, there you go.
[00:59:22.120 --> 00:59:23.120]   Another good one.
[00:59:23.120 --> 00:59:26.680]   David McCulloch does 1776, John Adams, Truman.
[00:59:26.680 --> 00:59:28.280]   A lot of his books are on there.
[00:59:28.280 --> 00:59:29.960]   He's a really great historian.
[00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:36.680]   History, fiction, nonfiction, self-help, whatever the genre you like or mix them up, which is
[00:59:36.680 --> 00:59:37.680]   what I do.
[00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:41.680]   Audible.com/twit, we thank him so much for their support.
[00:59:41.680 --> 00:59:43.720]   Well, there are a couple of other stories.
[00:59:43.720 --> 00:59:45.680]   Not all E3 gaming.
[00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:47.520]   Apple sues Cystar.
[00:59:47.520 --> 00:59:54.680]   Cystar is the company that said, "Hey, we could make a PC and just take OS X and modify
[00:59:54.680 --> 00:59:58.160]   it and put it on the PC and you'd get a Mac."
[00:59:58.160 --> 01:00:01.600]   And they said, "What could be wrong with that?"
[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:03.400]   Apple didn't say anything for months.
[01:00:03.400 --> 01:00:08.400]   They've been shooting at this piece of the day.
[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:13.400]   I was pretty surprised that they stayed quiet as long as they did.
[01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:15.400]   Not a word from Apple.
[01:00:15.400 --> 01:00:16.400]   How important is it that this is actually happening now?
[01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:17.400]   I wrote about this.
[01:00:17.400 --> 01:00:21.560]   I came around the thing in the digital hall, but wherever I wrote it, I said, "Listen,
[01:00:21.560 --> 01:00:23.960]   this is a major case for Apple.
[01:00:23.960 --> 01:00:28.680]   They've waited this long, which is kind of a problem, but they're really competing.
[01:00:28.680 --> 01:00:31.040]   Small companies are competing in a business they can never really win it.
[01:00:31.040 --> 01:00:32.040]   That's the PC market.
[01:00:32.040 --> 01:00:37.640]   They can never break in as a Windows base manufacturer with the Dell's HP's and Acer's
[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:38.640]   of the world."
[01:00:38.640 --> 01:00:43.400]   And so the best way to get a small PC company up and running, one of the best ways, is to
[01:00:43.400 --> 01:00:45.200]   run Mac OS X on a computer.
[01:00:45.200 --> 01:00:47.080]   And that's probably what Cystar was thinking.
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:51.320]   And so what if, and obviously this probably won't happen, but what if Cystar kind of got
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:52.400]   away with a slap on the wrist?
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:53.600]   I mean, this is going to invite...
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:55.680]   I think it's more than that.
[01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:56.760]   There's kind of a deep story.
[01:00:56.760 --> 01:01:00.800]   I think the reason Apple held off is they talked for a long time with Council.
[01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:02.840]   There's a huge risk in this.
[01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:04.320]   And here's the risk.
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:08.000]   It isn't immediately obvious that Apple has a case here.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.880]   Their greatest hope is that Cystar can't afford to fight them.
[01:01:11.880 --> 01:01:13.360]   Tucks their tail between their legs.
[01:01:13.360 --> 01:01:18.040]   Apple's even demanded that Cystar recall every computer they sold.
[01:01:18.040 --> 01:01:22.080]   But yeah, but it's not immediately obvious that they'd win this case.
[01:01:22.080 --> 01:01:23.080]   Here's the risk.
[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:25.080]   What if they lose?
[01:01:25.080 --> 01:01:27.480]   What if Cystar fights them?
[01:01:27.480 --> 01:01:28.480]   Not likely, probably.
[01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:29.480]   What if they did?
[01:01:29.480 --> 01:01:31.240]   What if they got somebody to support them?
[01:01:31.240 --> 01:01:35.120]   And one, all of a sudden Apple is in a very difficult position.
[01:01:35.120 --> 01:01:37.240]   They can't stop people from doing this.
[01:01:37.240 --> 01:01:39.080]   They're stepped on a hornet's nest.
[01:01:39.080 --> 01:01:40.080]   That's what I think.
[01:01:40.080 --> 01:01:45.160]   And they're going to have dozens and dozens of companies following the Cystar example.
[01:01:45.160 --> 01:01:48.560]   And they're going to use that case as a precedent if they ever have to face Apple.
[01:01:48.560 --> 01:01:52.240]   And they're going to say, "Listen, if we want to make it as a PC manufacturer, we'll
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:55.400]   look at the Michael Dell's of the world and we say, "Wow, look how rich that guy is.
[01:01:55.400 --> 01:01:56.400]   Look what we...
[01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:57.400]   This business could do."
[01:01:57.400 --> 01:01:59.160]   But we can't really sell Windows-based PCs.
[01:01:59.160 --> 01:02:04.000]   But now that we know we can sell Mac OS 10-based PCs, we know that Apple controls Mindshare
[01:02:04.000 --> 01:02:05.200]   over the industry.
[01:02:05.200 --> 01:02:06.200]   This is going to be major for us.
[01:02:06.200 --> 01:02:07.960]   We can make a ton of money doing this.
[01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:08.960]   We have to do it.
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:09.960]   So...
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:13.080]   Well, couldn't Apple still make money licensing OS 10?
[01:02:13.080 --> 01:02:14.400]   Well, that's the interesting thing.
[01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:15.560]   That's what we've always talked about.
[01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:18.440]   In fact, Larry, you probably have something to say about this.
[01:02:18.440 --> 01:02:19.520]   Whose wallet is fatter?
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:24.760]   Bill Gates, who made his living selling windows to any comer who wanted to build a computer,
[01:02:24.760 --> 01:02:26.080]   or Steve Jobs, who said, "No.
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:28.160]   You have to put my operating system on my hardware."
[01:02:28.160 --> 01:02:31.960]   Well, I mean, we can step back in time.
[01:02:31.960 --> 01:02:33.320]   I mean, Apple already did this once.
[01:02:33.320 --> 01:02:34.320]   They've licensed it.
[01:02:34.320 --> 01:02:37.600]   First thing Steve Jobs did when he came back is kill those licenses.
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:39.800]   Max that deal and moved to OS 8.
[01:02:39.800 --> 01:02:40.800]   Yeah.
[01:02:40.800 --> 01:02:41.880]   More than nine, I don't recall.
[01:02:41.880 --> 01:02:48.840]   But, yeah, I mean, the beauty of the Apple ecosystem is that they control everything,
[01:02:48.840 --> 01:02:50.400]   you know, top to bottom, end to end.
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:51.480]   You know, when you buy...
[01:02:51.480 --> 01:02:55.560]   When I bought my MacBook Pro, I didn't have 47 different icons trying to upsell me to
[01:02:55.560 --> 01:02:57.560]   every version of quick and unplug.
[01:02:57.560 --> 01:02:58.560]   Yeah, no kidding.
[01:02:58.560 --> 01:03:00.040]   Yeah, but that's not just because they're Apple.
[01:03:00.040 --> 01:03:01.800]   That's because they're not HP.
[01:03:01.800 --> 01:03:02.800]   Right.
[01:03:02.800 --> 01:03:07.120]   I mean, Apple could do that, but chooses not to.
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:09.360]   You know, I think this began.
[01:03:09.360 --> 01:03:13.000]   This story really began the day Apple decided to go Intel.
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:14.360]   And we talked about it from day one.
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:19.560]   The minute you put OS 10 on Intel, you face this very real possibility that people are
[01:03:19.560 --> 01:03:23.760]   going to figure out how to put OS 10 on other Intel PCs, because really the hardware is
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:25.320]   the same.
[01:03:25.320 --> 01:03:29.680]   And once they figure out how to get around EFI, the boot system instead of BIOS, which
[01:03:29.680 --> 01:03:34.000]   people have right away, I mean, my goodness, these Apple boxes, you know, have been around
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:38.680]   unofficially since day one, how long is it before cloners come back?
[01:03:38.680 --> 01:03:40.280]   And then can Apple fight them?
[01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:42.600]   They're going to fight them apparently on the case of the Yula.
[01:03:42.600 --> 01:03:45.200]   There's some question whether they can fight and win over the DMCA.
[01:03:45.200 --> 01:03:48.880]   You know, the DMCA says you can't reverse engineer copy protection.
[01:03:48.880 --> 01:03:51.640]   There is copy protection in Apple's OS 10.
[01:03:51.640 --> 01:03:52.640]   Maybe that's their plan.
[01:03:52.640 --> 01:03:55.000]   But I've also talked to others who said, "No.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:57.280]   This is a tough one to fight on over the DMCA."
[01:03:57.280 --> 01:04:01.520]   So I think it's a very, you know, Apple's biggest hope is that SciStar will just fold
[01:04:01.520 --> 01:04:02.520]   up shop.
[01:04:02.520 --> 01:04:03.520]   They're too small.
[01:04:03.520 --> 01:04:08.400]   Well, if they do, if SciStar does win, I think Apple has to license to the Dell's
[01:04:08.400 --> 01:04:10.160]   Visa and Acer's the world.
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:11.880]   And I think, you know, they already did fail at this.
[01:04:11.880 --> 01:04:15.120]   I mean, let's be honest, but the problem back then is that it's a much different environment
[01:04:15.120 --> 01:04:16.120]   to that.
[01:04:16.120 --> 01:04:18.080]   We have Vista where vendors really aren't too happy with it.
[01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:20.840]   They still are much happier with XP.
[01:04:20.840 --> 01:04:21.840]   Intel won't switch to Vista.
[01:04:21.840 --> 01:04:24.000]   All these major companies are saying, "Well, gee, Vista's okay."
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:25.000]   Maybe it's an opportunity.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:26.000]   Right.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.200]   And it might be an opportunity.
[01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:32.120]   And not to mention, if you license Mac OS 10 to Dell, HP and Acer and all these big companies,
[01:04:32.120 --> 01:04:34.320]   you kind of step on these small companies.
[01:04:34.320 --> 01:04:36.960]   You have to worry about them anymore because they're not going to be able to compete against
[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:38.240]   those major companies.
[01:04:38.240 --> 01:04:41.600]   So I think it's almost like you have to do it if you lose this case.
[01:04:41.600 --> 01:04:43.240]   And maybe Apple already knows that.
[01:04:43.240 --> 01:04:54.040]   A follow up on a story that we mentioned first last week, a San Francisco businessman locking
[01:04:54.040 --> 01:05:00.280]   administrators out of San Francisco's multi-million dollar fiber-wanned network, Terry Child's
[01:05:00.280 --> 01:05:02.680]   thrown in jail because he wouldn't give him the passwords.
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:03.680]   He said, "No."
[01:05:03.680 --> 01:05:04.680]   No.
[01:05:04.680 --> 01:05:05.680]   Uh-uh.
[01:05:05.680 --> 01:05:10.040]   Now, originally the story and the story we reported last week said that he was disgruntled,
[01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:13.440]   he was afraid he was going to get fired, and this was kind of a time bomb that he had
[01:05:13.440 --> 01:05:14.440]   put in.
[01:05:14.440 --> 01:05:18.840]   Slashdot had an interesting story this week saying, "You know, it might be more complicated
[01:05:18.840 --> 01:05:19.840]   than that.
[01:05:19.840 --> 01:05:24.760]   This may be the case of a Sisidman who didn't trust the bozos he was working with to run
[01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:30.160]   the network and just said, "No, I'm not letting you in there to modify it because I've set
[01:05:30.160 --> 01:05:32.360]   it up and it's working great.
[01:05:32.360 --> 01:05:33.360]   You can't touch it."
[01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:38.760]   And in fact, and this is what bolsters that argument, in fact, the network is running and
[01:05:38.760 --> 01:05:41.960]   has been running smoothly without flaw.
[01:05:41.960 --> 01:05:47.080]   No problems even though the guy is in jail because he won't give up the passwords.
[01:05:47.080 --> 01:05:48.880]   Is it a case of a Sisidman?
[01:05:48.880 --> 01:05:49.880]   You've seen him before.
[01:05:49.880 --> 01:05:52.560]   The IT guy is saying, "No, you can't touch it.
[01:05:52.560 --> 01:05:53.560]   I'm sorry.
[01:05:53.560 --> 01:05:55.000]   I'll just ruin it.
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.920]   It's perfect the way it is.
[01:05:56.920 --> 01:05:57.920]   You may not install it."
[01:05:57.920 --> 01:05:58.920]   That's incredible.
[01:05:58.920 --> 01:06:00.960]   I think that's what's going on.
[01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:02.800]   So what are they going to do now?
[01:06:02.800 --> 01:06:04.000]   I don't know.
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:04.880]   A source with direct...
[01:06:04.880 --> 01:06:12.400]   This is from the /.article, a source with direct knowledge of San Francisco's IT infrastructure.
[01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:16.920]   Has tipped off Paul Venezia to the real story behind Terry Child's lockout of San Francisco's
[01:06:16.920 --> 01:06:21.360]   network, providing a detailed account of the city's fiberwand, interdepartmental politics
[01:06:21.360 --> 01:06:23.000]   and Terry Childs himself.
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:28.240]   He's being held at $5 million bail.
[01:06:28.240 --> 01:06:31.640]   Childs was so concerned about the network's security he refused to even write router and
[01:06:31.640 --> 01:06:33.520]   switch configurations to flash.
[01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:38.280]   He kept him in his head.
[01:06:38.280 --> 01:06:43.800]   So Paul Venezia is the place to go to read this on his blog or actually his article in
[01:06:43.800 --> 01:06:45.040]   InfoWorld.
[01:06:45.040 --> 01:06:49.600]   It sounds like it's a very interesting story.
[01:06:49.600 --> 01:06:52.240]   Well, I don't think this is unique in any way.
[01:06:52.240 --> 01:06:55.200]   I mean, maybe I'm wrong, but here's my story.
[01:06:55.200 --> 01:06:57.800]   I used to be a big foreauditor before I get into this business.
[01:06:57.800 --> 01:06:58.800]   Oh, really?
[01:06:58.800 --> 01:06:59.800]   I didn't know about that.
[01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:00.800]   It's a whole other issue.
[01:07:00.800 --> 01:07:01.800]   Oh, yeah.
[01:07:01.800 --> 01:07:03.600]   I was working with the IT guy.
[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:05.400]   I had some questions about whatever.
[01:07:05.400 --> 01:07:10.320]   And we started talking about the national, the guy in charge of everything.
[01:07:10.320 --> 01:07:12.640]   And he's like, well, I don't let him get in on our network.
[01:07:12.640 --> 01:07:14.960]   He said, because he's kind of an idiot.
[01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:16.360]   That's exactly it.
[01:07:16.360 --> 01:07:17.960]   And it reminded me of this guy.
[01:07:17.960 --> 01:07:20.600]   I'm like, he's not unique in any way.
[01:07:20.600 --> 01:07:27.680]   He's a CCIE, probably the only one in city government that's the highest Cisco certification.
[01:07:27.680 --> 01:07:35.240]   Apparently, this is the story from InfoWorld.
[01:07:35.240 --> 01:07:40.200]   The San Francisco's newly hired head of security was pushing for child to open the fiber wind
[01:07:40.200 --> 01:07:41.520]   to other admins.
[01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:46.000]   And child said, no way, those guys are bozos.
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:49.520]   He says, I can imagine child's response.
[01:07:49.520 --> 01:07:50.520]   Why?
[01:07:50.520 --> 01:07:51.520]   So you can screw it up.
[01:07:51.520 --> 01:07:54.240]   So all my hard work.
[01:07:54.240 --> 01:07:56.320]   So they arrested him.
[01:07:56.320 --> 01:08:00.760]   So this will be very, very interesting.
[01:08:00.760 --> 01:08:02.840]   People are stepping forward saying, no, this guy's great.
[01:08:02.840 --> 01:08:05.640]   He's a great professional.
[01:08:05.640 --> 01:08:06.640]   He has a bad temper.
[01:08:06.640 --> 01:08:07.640]   And he's a kind of--
[01:08:07.640 --> 01:08:10.560]   How much bail is he being held on?
[01:08:10.560 --> 01:08:12.080]   Five million dollars bail.
[01:08:12.080 --> 01:08:14.200]   Why is it so high?
[01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:20.560]   Because this is the city's hugely expensive wide area network that they just recently
[01:08:20.560 --> 01:08:21.560]   built.
[01:08:21.560 --> 01:08:23.120]   I mean, it cost them millions and millions of dollars.
[01:08:23.120 --> 01:08:24.760]   And essentially, he's holding it hostage.
[01:08:24.760 --> 01:08:27.080]   Now, did they fire him?
[01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:28.080]   No.
[01:08:28.080 --> 01:08:29.080]   Well, I imagine they have now.
[01:08:29.080 --> 01:08:30.080]   Well, I mean, who knows?
[01:08:30.080 --> 01:08:32.720]   Because he's the only guy that has the only guy.
[01:08:32.720 --> 01:08:35.320]   And well, that's what the original story said.
[01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:36.920]   He thought he was going to get fired.
[01:08:36.920 --> 01:08:38.680]   And so he put this time bomb on there.
[01:08:38.680 --> 01:08:43.480]   But now, according to this article in InfoWorld, it's much more complicated than that.
[01:08:43.480 --> 01:08:46.640]   In fact, he just didn't want the bozos to touch it.
[01:08:46.640 --> 01:08:51.000]   And he got thrown in jail because he wouldn't give them the keys.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.600]   And they don't want to let him out because they said--
[01:08:53.600 --> 01:08:54.600]   --of making you talk.
[01:08:54.600 --> 01:09:00.360]   The fear is that if he makes a phone call, he might have accomplices outside who could
[01:09:00.360 --> 01:09:04.600]   blow with the system-- digitally blow the system up, destroy it.
[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:05.600]   Wow.
[01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:06.600]   But I don't think that's a problem.
[01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:07.600]   It's like a great movie.
[01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:08.600]   I think it's a great story.
[01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:11.920]   And I think it's a very interesting fight between San Francisco's new head of security
[01:09:11.920 --> 01:09:14.280]   who says, give me the keys.
[01:09:14.280 --> 01:09:15.920]   And this guy says, you'll screw it up.
[01:09:15.920 --> 01:09:18.160]   I'm not giving you the keys.
[01:09:18.160 --> 01:09:21.680]   And well, he's in jail right now.
[01:09:21.680 --> 01:09:24.400]   Let's see, what other stories are attracting attention?
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:29.200]   I mean, I have to say, I'll be perfectly honest, it's kind of a slow time right now in tech.
[01:09:29.200 --> 01:09:32.400]   When you get to the summertime, people go on vacation.
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:34.240]   There's not much to say.
[01:09:34.240 --> 01:09:35.240]   There hasn't been a bit--
[01:09:35.240 --> 01:09:36.240]   What about this?
[01:09:36.240 --> 01:09:37.840]   --Microsoft hasn't tried to buy Yahoo in the last few days.
[01:09:37.840 --> 01:09:38.840]   So--
[01:09:38.840 --> 01:09:40.320]   Nothing to talk about on that.
[01:09:40.320 --> 01:09:42.400]   Nothing to talk about there.
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:44.200]   What about this YouTube thing with Lionsgate?
[01:09:44.200 --> 01:09:46.000]   They just align with Lionsgate now.
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.120]   And obviously, last thing is a couple weeks ago, they went with Seth MacFarlane to make
[01:09:49.120 --> 01:09:50.360]   their own branded channels.
[01:09:50.360 --> 01:09:54.840]   And I wonder if this is the first step of YouTube finally saying, well, I think it's time we
[01:09:54.840 --> 01:09:55.640]   got to make this thing--
[01:09:55.640 --> 01:09:57.280]   or Google saying we have to make this thing properly.
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:09:58.280]   Partnerships.
[01:09:58.280 --> 01:09:59.280]   And we got to do partnerships.
[01:09:59.280 --> 01:10:00.280]   We can't be the--
[01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:01.280]   We can't be the--
[01:10:01.280 --> 01:10:02.280]   We can't really get.
[01:10:02.280 --> 01:10:03.280]   Yeah.
[01:10:03.280 --> 01:10:04.280]   Exactly.
[01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:06.920]   I mean, because YouTube, to me, is just-- there's no control over the content.
[01:10:06.920 --> 01:10:11.280]   So Dove Soap doesn't want to put their ads on it, you know, on some guy mooning a crowd.
[01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:13.240]   So we don't have to go out.
[01:10:13.240 --> 01:10:14.920]   And there's no demographic data.
[01:10:14.920 --> 01:10:18.200]   And so Google has finally kind of come around and said, why don't we just separate it?
[01:10:18.200 --> 01:10:22.160]   We'll separate the content, you know, put it on new channels like Lionsgate and Seth MacFarlane
[01:10:22.160 --> 01:10:23.160]   stuff.
[01:10:23.160 --> 01:10:24.160]   And we can control the content.
[01:10:24.160 --> 01:10:25.640]   Our advertisers know the demographics.
[01:10:25.640 --> 01:10:29.240]   And we can sell ads like that and hopefully turn a profit.
[01:10:29.240 --> 01:10:30.440]   I think it may even be more than that.
[01:10:30.440 --> 01:10:36.160]   I think the Viacom Legal Challenge might be making them think, we got to do something
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:37.160]   here.
[01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:40.360]   And you know, it's not just that they can't put ads there because the advertisers won't
[01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:41.360]   do it.
[01:10:41.360 --> 01:10:46.040]   Some courts have said, if you put ads on there, if you monetize these videos, now you have
[01:10:46.040 --> 01:10:48.080]   a responsibility.
[01:10:48.080 --> 01:10:50.240]   Now you're not just rebroadcasting stuff.
[01:10:50.240 --> 01:10:55.520]   You're making money on that page with that DMCA illegal video.
[01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:58.120]   And so there's some concern that there may be the issue there.
[01:10:58.120 --> 01:10:59.480]   And so how do you save YouTube?
[01:10:59.480 --> 01:11:01.400]   You can't monetize it if that's the case.
[01:11:01.400 --> 01:11:04.080]   So all of a sudden, the only way to monetize it is say, well, we got to make sure there's
[01:11:04.080 --> 01:11:05.800]   no illegal videos on here.
[01:11:05.800 --> 01:11:08.320]   But by the way, kills YouTube.
[01:11:08.320 --> 01:11:14.360]   Do you go to do go to YouTube to see legal videos or people getting hit in the crotch?
[01:11:14.360 --> 01:11:16.720]   I go for cat videos and laughing babies.
[01:11:16.720 --> 01:11:17.720]   Exactly.
[01:11:17.720 --> 01:11:19.720]   Charlie, bit me.
[01:11:19.720 --> 01:11:22.240]   Charlie, he bit me.
[01:11:22.240 --> 01:11:24.520]   Have you seen that one?
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:26.760]   Just look for Charlie bit me if you like.
[01:11:26.760 --> 01:11:27.760]   It's very funny.
[01:11:27.760 --> 01:11:31.720]   I don't know what kind of stuff you're into watching Leo.
[01:11:31.720 --> 01:11:33.360]   It's a little kid.
[01:11:33.360 --> 01:11:34.840]   It's a little kid.
[01:11:34.840 --> 01:11:37.960]   You want laughing babies.
[01:11:37.960 --> 01:11:40.240]   It's a little kid.
[01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:41.240]   It's funny.
[01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:44.960]   I had a conversation with Google a couple weeks ago, I was talking to them about when
[01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:46.480]   the Seth MacFarlane deal hit.
[01:11:46.480 --> 01:11:51.520]   And they said, you need to realize that we're not necessarily trying to sell advertising
[01:11:51.520 --> 01:11:55.480]   after we put the videos up, he says to me, he says, what we want to do, what we're doing
[01:11:55.480 --> 01:11:59.320]   is when we're forming these deals, we're bringing advertisers on at the same time.
[01:11:59.320 --> 01:12:01.120]   And so we're going to have exclusive advertising.
[01:12:01.120 --> 01:12:02.120]   That's the idea.
[01:12:02.120 --> 01:12:04.080]   So you've got the Seth MacFarlane channel.
[01:12:04.080 --> 01:12:05.080]   That's why they're doing it, right?
[01:12:05.080 --> 01:12:09.240]   So people drive traffic to Seth MacFarlane and then you play an ad.
[01:12:09.240 --> 01:12:10.240]   Right.
[01:12:10.240 --> 01:12:11.240]   Yeah.
[01:12:11.240 --> 01:12:16.400]   S3 was down most of the day Amazon's storage system is now back up as we record.
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:17.840]   It's got to be a black eye for Amazon.
[01:12:17.840 --> 01:12:21.680]   I mean, so many people rely on S3 storage.
[01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:24.360]   Twitter does for their images on their icons.
[01:12:24.360 --> 01:12:25.360]   So does Pounce.
[01:12:25.360 --> 01:12:28.560]   Amazon was having trouble two weeks ago too.
[01:12:28.560 --> 01:12:29.560]   Yeah.
[01:12:29.560 --> 01:12:30.560]   They went down for a while.
[01:12:30.560 --> 01:12:32.720]   I wonder what's going on over there that's causing all these issues.
[01:12:32.720 --> 01:12:33.720]   Not five nines.
[01:12:33.720 --> 01:12:34.720]   That's for sure.
[01:12:34.720 --> 01:12:35.720]   Yeah.
[01:12:35.720 --> 01:12:39.560]   You might like this one, Veronica, the 3G iPhone, jailbroken.
[01:12:39.560 --> 01:12:40.560]   Sure ponens.
[01:12:40.560 --> 01:12:41.560]   Well, no kidding.
[01:12:41.560 --> 01:12:43.920]   They announced it was jailbroken the first day it came out.
[01:12:43.920 --> 01:12:44.920]   But they actually released it.
[01:12:44.920 --> 01:12:46.400]   2.0 firmware came out.
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:47.800]   Yeah, they released it.
[01:12:47.800 --> 01:12:49.400]   Yeah, well, maybe that'll fix my iPhone.
[01:12:49.400 --> 01:12:50.400]   What's your problem?
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:51.400]   What's going on with yours?
[01:12:51.400 --> 01:12:52.400]   Piece of crap.
[01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:53.400]   Oh, man.
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:54.400]   Take it back.
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:55.400]   Mine's been fine.
[01:12:55.400 --> 01:12:56.400]   I just restored it from it.
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:57.600]   I just did a cleaner store.
[01:12:57.600 --> 01:12:58.600]   So hopefully that'll fix my issues.
[01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:00.360]   When you say piece of crap, what's been happening?
[01:13:00.360 --> 01:13:01.520]   He's been crashing a lot?
[01:13:01.520 --> 01:13:05.320]   Well, I wrote a whole blog post about it, but it's been crashing nonstop.
[01:13:05.320 --> 01:13:09.720]   It takes about 30 seconds for the text messaging when I'm trying to bring up the keyboard to
[01:13:09.720 --> 01:13:10.720]   finally work.
[01:13:10.720 --> 01:13:11.720]   Yeah.
[01:13:11.720 --> 01:13:13.240]   None of my GPS stuff works at all.
[01:13:13.240 --> 01:13:14.240]   Yeah.
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:15.240]   Cool.
[01:13:15.240 --> 01:13:16.240]   I can't use it.
[01:13:16.240 --> 01:13:17.240]   I don't know.
[01:13:17.240 --> 01:13:18.240]   I'm going to see if it works now.
[01:13:18.240 --> 01:13:19.240]   I just did it right before it started.
[01:13:19.240 --> 01:13:21.200]   So I haven't really tested it since I've done the cleaner store.
[01:13:21.200 --> 01:13:24.840]   One thing that's bugging me is how long every time I sink it, it takes like an hour to back
[01:13:24.840 --> 01:13:26.320]   up the iPhone before the sink.
[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:28.120]   Yeah, the sinking takes forever.
[01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:29.120]   What's that?
[01:13:29.120 --> 01:13:30.120]   Oh, man.
[01:13:30.120 --> 01:13:31.120]   My battery is like a joke.
[01:13:31.120 --> 01:13:32.120]   Oh, yeah.
[01:13:32.120 --> 01:13:33.120]   The battery creates this.
[01:13:33.120 --> 01:13:34.120]   Like even if I turn off everything, it's completely.
[01:13:34.120 --> 01:13:35.120]   Yeah.
[01:13:35.120 --> 01:13:36.120]   And I mean, I love my iPhone.
[01:13:36.120 --> 01:13:39.600]   I loved my original iPhone to death and I'm missing the hell out of it now.
[01:13:39.600 --> 01:13:41.360]   Thinking I should go back.
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:42.360]   Oh, my God.
[01:13:42.360 --> 01:13:44.600]   I'm like in the 2.0.
[01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:46.960]   However, you know, there are a lot of crashes.
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:47.960]   The battery life is terrible.
[01:13:47.960 --> 01:13:52.320]   I can't wait to get a mophie for the 3G so I can use that backup battery to keep it
[01:13:52.320 --> 01:13:53.320]   going.
[01:13:53.320 --> 01:13:54.320]   Right, right.
[01:13:54.320 --> 01:13:57.800]   But everyone's telling me, yeah, it'll work better if you turn off the Wi-Fi and if you
[01:13:57.800 --> 01:14:02.000]   turn off the push and if you turn off the GPS, I'm like, okay, then so why did I spend
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:03.600]   all this money on a new iPhone?
[01:14:03.600 --> 01:14:04.600]   Exactly.
[01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:05.600]   I'll be the new feature.
[01:14:05.600 --> 01:14:06.600]   Yeah.
[01:14:06.600 --> 01:14:07.600]   Larry, do you have an iPhone?
[01:14:07.600 --> 01:14:08.600]   I do not.
[01:14:08.600 --> 01:14:11.360]   I have a trio 800 that I got last week that I am just loving.
[01:14:11.360 --> 01:14:15.680]   I have an eye touch that I loaded the 2.0 firmware on and I was actually running into
[01:14:15.680 --> 01:14:20.320]   some of the sluggishness issues and then I had to back my exchange mail down to one
[01:14:20.320 --> 01:14:21.720]   day instead of three days.
[01:14:21.720 --> 01:14:22.720]   It's all dead.
[01:14:22.720 --> 01:14:23.720]   Oh, maybe that's interesting.
[01:14:23.720 --> 01:14:26.080]   The apps are a lot of fun though, aren't they?
[01:14:26.080 --> 01:14:27.400]   I love the apps when they work.
[01:14:27.400 --> 01:14:28.800]   They do crash a lot.
[01:14:28.800 --> 01:14:29.800]   Mm-hmm.
[01:14:29.800 --> 01:14:30.800]   They're very crashy.
[01:14:30.800 --> 01:14:31.800]   I think they're getting better.
[01:14:31.800 --> 01:14:35.560]   You know, I've already had updates on seven or eight apps several times on some of them.
[01:14:35.560 --> 01:14:38.760]   So obviously they rushed a lot of this stuff so that they'd have a big showing in the
[01:14:38.760 --> 01:14:41.000]   app store and now people are getting.
[01:14:41.000 --> 01:14:42.760]   Apple doesn't let you test.
[01:14:42.760 --> 01:14:43.760]   Right?
[01:14:43.760 --> 01:14:44.760]   How are you going to test it?
[01:14:44.760 --> 01:14:46.160]   No, you can't test this.
[01:14:46.160 --> 01:14:47.680]   Nobody's got it.
[01:14:47.680 --> 01:14:50.720]   So I guess we were the test and now that you're going to start to see improvement.
[01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:54.520]   But yeah, what's your favorite app right now on the iPhone?
[01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:56.520]   My favorite app, let's say, let me look.
[01:14:56.520 --> 01:14:58.520]   Actually, I think I love the Yelp app the most.
[01:14:58.520 --> 01:14:59.520]   Yelp is great.
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:02.200]   Yelp and the Pandora apps are a lot of fun.
[01:15:02.200 --> 01:15:04.360]   Pandora is amazing.
[01:15:04.360 --> 01:15:06.080]   I mean, I've been using the mobile flicker.
[01:15:06.080 --> 01:15:07.080]   I paid for it.
[01:15:07.080 --> 01:15:08.240]   That's the only one I've paid for so far.
[01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:10.120]   I'm not loving it so much.
[01:15:10.120 --> 01:15:12.800]   I know there's a lot of other flicker alternatives that I should try.
[01:15:12.800 --> 01:15:13.800]   I use AirMe.
[01:15:13.800 --> 01:15:14.800]   AirMe?
[01:15:14.800 --> 01:15:15.800]   What's that one?
[01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:16.800]   A-I-R-M-E.
[01:15:16.800 --> 01:15:20.360]   So you take a picture and you upload it directly to Flicker.
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:23.760]   It puts in the weather and your location automatically.
[01:15:23.760 --> 01:15:24.920]   It's kind of cool.
[01:15:24.920 --> 01:15:26.400]   You've been using Twinkle a lot too, have you?
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:27.920]   I love Twinkle.
[01:15:27.920 --> 01:15:32.400]   I want more people to use it because Twinkle is a Twitter client with this neat little
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:37.240]   additional feature that you can show people within a certain radius of where you are,
[01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:38.560]   whether you follow them or not.
[01:15:38.560 --> 01:15:44.360]   So if there are other Twinkle users within a mile, five miles, 25 miles, I'll see them.
[01:15:44.360 --> 01:15:47.640]   So it's a way, if more people use it, I want everybody to use it because if more people
[01:15:47.640 --> 01:15:51.120]   use it, then I can see more people than just the people I normally follow because they're
[01:15:51.120 --> 01:15:52.120]   near me.
[01:15:52.120 --> 01:15:55.320]   Yeah, Twinkle was originally a jailbroken app, right?
[01:15:55.320 --> 01:15:56.320]   It works quite well.
[01:15:56.320 --> 01:15:57.880]   It's crashed on me a couple of times, but it works quite well.
[01:15:57.880 --> 01:16:02.000]   I think a lot of the crashes are associated with the location stuff because every time
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:10.680]   you have to do location, you have to, the phone asks you, do you want location?
[01:16:10.680 --> 01:16:17.360]   And I think there's something going on with that particular process that's problematic.
[01:16:17.360 --> 01:16:21.520]   It was getting a little annoying every time I turned on my camera to take a picture on
[01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:23.840]   the iPhone and be like, "Do you want us to use this location?
[01:16:23.840 --> 01:16:24.840]   Do you want us to use this location?"
[01:16:24.840 --> 01:16:26.560]   I'm like, "Well, I'm glad they do this."
[01:16:26.560 --> 01:16:27.560]   You just use it.
[01:16:27.560 --> 01:16:28.560]   Fine.
[01:16:28.560 --> 01:16:29.560]   Don't ask me every time.
[01:16:29.560 --> 01:16:32.880]   Don't you think it's good that they do that because otherwise there might be people saying,
[01:16:32.880 --> 01:16:34.560]   "Well, yeah, but I didn't want anybody to know."
[01:16:34.560 --> 01:16:36.880]   That was the complaint actually about some apps.
[01:16:36.880 --> 01:16:40.280]   No, but I mean, I would rather make the decision once and then turn it off if I didn't want
[01:16:40.280 --> 01:16:41.280]   to use it.
[01:16:41.280 --> 01:16:44.040]   It's like asking for my password every time I download an app like this.
[01:16:44.040 --> 01:16:48.360]   I already told you, "Okay, it's not really going to drive me to not if someone borrows
[01:16:48.360 --> 01:16:53.560]   my phone and adds another application on their one off getting a beer or something."
[01:16:53.560 --> 01:16:55.640]   Well, that's something they can easily fix.
[01:16:55.640 --> 01:16:57.360]   You sound very unhappy.
[01:16:57.360 --> 01:16:59.280]   I hate being unhappy about it.
[01:16:59.280 --> 01:17:01.200]   It's really been very frustrating.
[01:17:01.200 --> 01:17:02.480]   I want to enjoy it.
[01:17:02.480 --> 01:17:07.800]   I want to say nice things because I think it's a great piece of hardware, but the software
[01:17:07.800 --> 01:17:10.920]   just isn't living up to my expectations right now.
[01:17:10.920 --> 01:17:13.160]   Well, I've been happy with it.
[01:17:13.160 --> 01:17:17.800]   The fact I got the first iPhone and went to BlackBerry shortly thereafter because I couldn't
[01:17:17.800 --> 01:17:19.720]   add applications.
[01:17:19.720 --> 01:17:20.960]   I love these apps so much.
[01:17:20.960 --> 01:17:21.960]   Oh, Shazam.
[01:17:21.960 --> 01:17:22.960]   Someone mentioned Shazam.
[01:17:22.960 --> 01:17:23.960]   That app rules.
[01:17:23.960 --> 01:17:24.960]   That's a great app.
[01:17:24.960 --> 01:17:26.800]   But you'd play with Midori too, right?
[01:17:26.800 --> 01:17:27.800]   Is it Midori or Medomi?
[01:17:27.800 --> 01:17:28.800]   Medomi?
[01:17:28.800 --> 01:17:29.800]   Medomi.
[01:17:29.800 --> 01:17:32.360]   I tried Medomi and I didn't love it as much as they do different things.
[01:17:32.360 --> 01:17:36.200]   So, Medomi, you can like, come into and Shazam, you have to actually hold it up to the music
[01:17:36.200 --> 01:17:37.200]   source.
[01:17:37.200 --> 01:17:38.200]   You can do both.
[01:17:38.200 --> 01:17:39.200]   But it's been 100% working.
[01:17:39.200 --> 01:17:40.680]   It's pretty cool, isn't it?
[01:17:40.680 --> 01:17:41.680]   Yeah.
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:42.680]   Yeah.
[01:17:42.680 --> 01:17:43.880]   I actually can sing to Medomi and have it play.
[01:17:43.880 --> 01:17:45.360]   I did this last time.
[01:17:45.360 --> 01:17:46.360]   It's fun.
[01:17:46.360 --> 01:17:47.360]   We're going to wrap this up.
[01:17:47.360 --> 01:17:48.360]   That's a lovely baritone.
[01:17:48.360 --> 01:17:49.360]   We're going to...
[01:17:49.360 --> 01:17:52.800]   Hey, I love nothing more than to do.
[01:17:52.800 --> 01:17:54.360]   Twit with you.
[01:17:54.360 --> 01:17:57.640]   Veronica Belmont is on Tekzilla.
[01:17:57.640 --> 01:17:59.640]   You got Tekzilla.com, which is cool.
[01:17:59.640 --> 01:18:07.720]   T-E-K-Z-I-L-L-A.com or revision3.com/tekzilla with her good friend and mind, Patrick Norton,
[01:18:07.720 --> 01:18:10.520]   also on Core Q-O-R-E on the PlayStation Network.
[01:18:10.520 --> 01:18:16.520]   Just go to PSN on your PS3 and subscribe to Core right now.
[01:18:16.520 --> 01:18:17.520]   Great.
[01:18:17.520 --> 01:18:18.520]   That would be wonderful.
[01:18:18.520 --> 01:18:22.760]   Great layout in the PlayStation magazine on Veronica with nice pictures and a great
[01:18:22.760 --> 01:18:23.760]   article about you.
[01:18:23.760 --> 01:18:24.760]   I really enjoyed it.
[01:18:24.760 --> 01:18:25.960]   I'm glad you got to see it.
[01:18:25.960 --> 01:18:26.960]   Yeah.
[01:18:26.960 --> 01:18:30.120]   I have two PlayStation 3s, you know.
[01:18:30.120 --> 01:18:31.680]   I don't know why.
[01:18:31.680 --> 01:18:33.480]   You can subscribe to Core twice.
[01:18:33.480 --> 01:18:34.480]   I could.
[01:18:34.480 --> 01:18:35.480]   I should subscribe twice.
[01:18:35.480 --> 01:18:36.480]   One here.
[01:18:36.480 --> 01:18:37.480]   I'm just joking.
[01:18:37.480 --> 01:18:38.480]   One at the office and one at the home.
[01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:41.400]   I have an Xbox 360 at home and I love it deeply.
[01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:44.760]   If anybody wants an HD DVD drive, just let me know.
[01:18:44.760 --> 01:18:45.960]   I don't think...
[01:18:45.960 --> 01:18:46.960]   I just have the Feline.
[01:18:46.960 --> 01:18:49.800]   I have a feeling HD DVD is not going anywhere.
[01:18:49.800 --> 01:18:50.800]   I don't know why.
[01:18:50.800 --> 01:18:51.800]   I just get the feeling.
[01:18:51.800 --> 01:18:53.520]   Major Nelson, I'm so glad we could get you on.
[01:18:53.520 --> 01:18:54.520]   I'm thrilled.
[01:18:54.520 --> 01:18:56.320]   I've wanted to get you on for a long time.
[01:18:56.320 --> 01:18:59.400]   Well, it's my pleasure and I would love to come back whenever you'll have me.
[01:18:59.400 --> 01:19:02.960]   It's just been great sitting here with you guys and talking about E3 and you don't have
[01:19:02.960 --> 01:19:04.200]   to have me on for the next E3.
[01:19:04.200 --> 01:19:05.200]   I can come on before that.
[01:19:05.200 --> 01:19:06.360]   We'll do it before then.
[01:19:06.360 --> 01:19:11.040]   If you want to hear more of majornelson, majornelson.com is the place to go.
[01:19:11.040 --> 01:19:12.040]   Is it now?
[01:19:12.040 --> 01:19:13.040]   We were discussing this beforehand.
[01:19:13.040 --> 01:19:15.200]   Are you named Major Nelson because of I Dream of Jeannie?
[01:19:15.200 --> 01:19:16.200]   It is exactly right.
[01:19:16.200 --> 01:19:19.400]   When I got the job in the Xbox team, I've been working at Microsoft for about eight or
[01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:20.400]   nine years.
[01:19:20.400 --> 01:19:25.160]   When I got the job of the Microsoft team, I came home and my Tivo had recommended I Dream
[01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:26.160]   of Jeannie.
[01:19:26.160 --> 01:19:27.160]   It was brilliant.
[01:19:27.160 --> 01:19:30.640]   I said, "That's the one."
[01:19:30.640 --> 01:19:34.040]   We've decided that you're Major Nelson.
[01:19:34.040 --> 01:19:37.040]   I'm his buddy who was named Major Healy.
[01:19:37.040 --> 01:19:38.520]   You're the only person.
[01:19:38.520 --> 01:19:40.320]   Veronica, of course, is Jeannie.
[01:19:40.320 --> 01:19:44.560]   We were thinking and thinking who could Don be and we decided he's Dr. Bellos.
[01:19:44.560 --> 01:19:46.280]   He's Dr. Bellos, of course.
[01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:47.280]   He is.
[01:19:47.280 --> 01:19:51.220]   Hey, Larry, should we tell them the story about how we know each other from way back
[01:19:51.220 --> 01:19:53.080]   line or should we say about Dr. Nelson?
[01:19:53.080 --> 01:19:54.920]   I think we should absolutely do that right now.
[01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:56.920]   Are you going to get himself an exclusive?
[01:19:56.920 --> 01:19:58.680]   You know each other from when?
[01:19:58.680 --> 01:20:01.520]   We found out that, well, you tell it.
[01:20:01.520 --> 01:20:02.520]   You tell it.
[01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:08.000]   Well, prior to joining Microsoft, I worked on the East Coast for a series of radio stations
[01:20:08.000 --> 01:20:10.720]   in Connecticut and Boston and New York.
[01:20:10.720 --> 01:20:13.120]   When I was working Connecticut, we had five radio stations.
[01:20:13.120 --> 01:20:18.200]   I worked with I was the director of promotions and marketing and a bunch of other stuff.
[01:20:18.200 --> 01:20:22.600]   We found out that Veronica and I worked at the same radio.
[01:20:22.600 --> 01:20:23.600]   That's funny.
[01:20:23.600 --> 01:20:25.440]   Yeah, but I was a lowly intern.
[01:20:25.440 --> 01:20:26.440]   So he didn't remember you?
[01:20:26.440 --> 01:20:29.440]   I was an intern making cappuccinos for Decenider on the morning show.
[01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:30.440]   Oh, Decenider.
[01:20:30.440 --> 01:20:31.440]   Yeah.
[01:20:31.440 --> 01:20:32.440]   Twisted sister, right?
[01:20:32.440 --> 01:20:33.440]   Uh-huh.
[01:20:33.440 --> 01:20:39.360]   And he was the morning show guy over at 104.1 WMRQ when it was a modern rock station.
[01:20:39.360 --> 01:20:41.920]   He must have been a weird person to work for.
[01:20:41.920 --> 01:20:43.080]   He was a funny guy, actually.
[01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:44.080]   He was really funny.
[01:20:44.080 --> 01:20:45.560]   I will cut that in.
[01:20:45.560 --> 01:20:46.800]   You dealt with him from one side.
[01:20:46.800 --> 01:20:50.400]   My job was actually to help teach D how to do radio.
[01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:53.120]   I had four people and I was one of the people that would help.
[01:20:53.120 --> 01:20:54.120]   You're not going to take it.
[01:20:54.120 --> 01:20:55.920]   Yeah, he's like, what do you mean?
[01:20:55.920 --> 01:20:59.640]   I'm like, see, this is, this is, you're now in, you're now in Hartford, Connecticut.
[01:20:59.640 --> 01:21:00.800]   You're not on tour.
[01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:05.760]   But it's a different set of rules now.
[01:21:05.760 --> 01:21:07.160]   So it's a very small world.
[01:21:07.160 --> 01:21:10.880]   And when we found that we just thought it was totally, totally ridiculous.
[01:21:10.880 --> 01:21:11.880]   Radio is totally like that.
[01:21:11.880 --> 01:21:13.040]   You know, I run into people all the time.
[01:21:13.040 --> 01:21:14.040]   I worked with a radio.
[01:21:14.040 --> 01:21:15.040]   It's totally like that.
[01:21:15.040 --> 01:21:16.040]   It's such a small.
[01:21:16.040 --> 01:21:19.680]   Yeah, I found a lot of people from that station on, on my space and all over the place who
[01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:24.720]   were like, wow, it's so funny to run into you again at this stage in the game.
[01:21:24.720 --> 01:21:25.720]   It's really funny.
[01:21:25.720 --> 01:21:31.240]   It's a pleasure to finally, we finally met for the first time last week, you know, before
[01:21:31.240 --> 01:21:33.800]   we were 10 years ago, we worked together and radio care.
[01:21:33.800 --> 01:21:35.720]   Did you remember her at all, Larry?
[01:21:35.720 --> 01:21:36.720]   I do not.
[01:21:36.720 --> 01:21:38.840]   I don't remember him either.
[01:21:38.840 --> 01:21:40.480]   He was way too high up on the totem pole.
[01:21:40.480 --> 01:21:42.640]   I probably never even walked past him.
[01:21:42.640 --> 01:21:43.640]   So funny.
[01:21:43.640 --> 01:21:44.640]   That's great.
[01:21:44.640 --> 01:21:49.400]   Well, Larry, and of course, many people don't know is the original creator of Bozo.
[01:21:49.400 --> 01:21:53.360]   But the Bozo, the clown, and as the franchise, I believe, to Bozo, the clown all over the
[01:21:53.360 --> 01:21:54.360]   country.
[01:21:54.360 --> 01:21:55.360]   No, I'm just kidding.
[01:21:55.360 --> 01:21:58.520]   That was Larry Harmon, who recently passed away.
[01:21:58.520 --> 01:22:01.240]   And we're going to miss him.
[01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:06.160]   And I also think, oh, by the way, Veronica, happy birthday and belated happy birthday.
[01:22:06.160 --> 01:22:10.320]   Oh, and early, you know, an early happy birthday ending on when the show airs.
[01:22:10.320 --> 01:22:12.360]   My room is tomorrow.
[01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:13.360]   Tomorrow.
[01:22:13.360 --> 01:22:14.360]   It'll air.
[01:22:14.360 --> 01:22:15.360]   This is your birthday.
[01:22:15.360 --> 01:22:17.680]   We're taping at the day before.
[01:22:17.680 --> 01:22:20.000]   But it airs on Monday.
[01:22:20.000 --> 01:22:22.000]   Oh, yeah, even happy birthday.
[01:22:22.000 --> 01:22:23.000]   Congratulations.
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:24.000]   Can you drink now?
[01:22:24.000 --> 01:22:25.000]   Are you still underage?
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:26.840]   Oh, you're so funny.
[01:22:26.840 --> 01:22:28.640]   Flatter me.
[01:22:28.640 --> 01:22:31.440]   So I'd be part of the series.
[01:22:31.440 --> 01:22:33.440]   What are you going to do for your birthday, Veronica?
[01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:35.280]   Are you going to get engaged?
[01:22:35.280 --> 01:22:39.280]   No, I'm going to be on a shoot actually tomorrow.
[01:22:39.280 --> 01:22:40.280]   Oh, that's no fun.
[01:22:40.280 --> 01:22:41.280]   Down in Santa Monica.
[01:22:41.280 --> 01:22:43.840]   So I will be working, but still fun.
[01:22:43.840 --> 01:22:46.920]   Well, I'm glad we could get you because now that you are doing both Texas Island core,
[01:22:46.920 --> 01:22:48.520]   you're much busier than you used to be.
[01:22:48.520 --> 01:22:52.440]   And so I'm really glad we could get you on a lot of traveling for sure.
[01:22:52.440 --> 01:22:53.440]   But it's great.
[01:22:53.440 --> 01:22:54.440]   Good.
[01:22:54.440 --> 01:22:56.520]   Will you be a comic con, Veronica?
[01:22:56.520 --> 01:22:57.520]   I won't be.
[01:22:57.520 --> 01:23:00.360]   I'm actually going on vacation next week for a few days.
[01:23:00.360 --> 01:23:04.000]   You picked a good one on vacation because I've been I'm going to be down a comic con.
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:05.000]   I have fun.
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:06.000]   You're lucky.
[01:23:06.000 --> 01:23:07.000]   That would be fun to go.
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:08.000]   Will you be the guy in the volcanoes?
[01:23:08.000 --> 01:23:13.000]   Yeah, I would decide if I'm going to wear my volcanoes or, well, never mind, or my storm
[01:23:13.000 --> 01:23:14.000]   trooper outfit.
[01:23:14.000 --> 01:23:15.000]   I'm going to come figure it out.
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:18.680]   Be Chewbacca.
[01:23:18.680 --> 01:23:23.200]   Don rising if you go to comic con, what costume would you wear?
[01:23:23.200 --> 01:23:25.360]   Oh, I wear nothing.
[01:23:25.360 --> 01:23:26.360]   I don't think I'd wear anything.
[01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:27.360]   You'd be naked, man.
[01:23:27.360 --> 01:23:29.800]   I don't even know what I've never really been into comics.
[01:23:29.800 --> 01:23:31.040]   It's not really my thing.
[01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:32.040]   So I really know.
[01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:33.040]   Maybe it's interesting.
[01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:34.040]   Let's be clear.
[01:23:34.040 --> 01:23:35.040]   Let's be clear.
[01:23:35.040 --> 01:23:36.040]   I'm not in the comics either.
[01:23:36.040 --> 01:23:37.040]   I have to go to work.
[01:23:37.040 --> 01:23:38.040]   Too late.
[01:23:38.040 --> 01:23:39.040]   Too late.
[01:23:39.040 --> 01:23:40.040]   No, no.
[01:23:40.040 --> 01:23:41.040]   No.
[01:23:41.040 --> 01:23:46.040]   Ladies, gentlemen, Don Rizinger is available online at digitalhome.cnet.com, but also many
[01:23:46.040 --> 01:23:49.360]   other places, including ours, Technica and Mashable.
[01:23:49.360 --> 01:23:50.360]   Thank you, everybody.
[01:23:50.360 --> 01:23:51.360]   We'll see you next time.
[01:23:51.360 --> 01:23:53.160]   Another Twit is in the can.
[01:23:53.160 --> 01:23:54.160]   All right.
[01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:55.160]   I should have paid attention.
[01:23:55.160 --> 01:23:57.160]   I don't know what I'm going to do.
[01:23:57.160 --> 01:23:58.160]   Too much work.
[01:23:58.160 --> 01:23:59.160]   The problem is there's no limit.
[01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:01.160]   My server is completely collapsed.
[01:24:01.160 --> 01:24:02.160]   So here's the deal.
[01:24:02.160 --> 01:24:06.360]   I'm just trying to get the thing off, but I have a hell of a time when blue screens
[01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:13.360]   like forget it.
[01:24:13.360 --> 01:24:31.120]   Thanks for watching.
[01:24:31.120 --> 01:24:33.700]   (upbeat music)
