[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:10.240]   Hi, Will.
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.120]   Hello, how you doing?
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:14.560]   Are you trying to sound American?
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:15.840]   No.
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:18.440]   It's just very late tonight and I get tired.
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.560]   Hello.
[00:01:19.560 --> 00:01:21.600]   How are you?
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.840]   Also here with us from Florida.
[00:01:24.840 --> 00:01:26.520]   Is it Florida? Am I right?

[00:01:34.040 --> 00:01:36.600]   You were going to be the Audible pick this week,
[00:01:36.600 --> 00:01:38.200]   but you'll see why you're not.
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:39.600]   We'll make it next week.
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:40.320]   I understand.
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:43.480]   You understand, I'm sure, when you will, when you hear where our pick is.
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:46.360]   And of course, Mr. John C.
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:51.480]   Confessions of a PC hitman Devorak.
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:52.400]   Hey there.
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:01:59.200]   From devorak.org/blog and no agenda and take tech five and cranky geeks.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:03.000]   You now have there's like four shows you do at least once a week.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.600]   Yeah, too many.
[00:02:04.600 --> 00:02:05.640]   Really? You're getting sick of it?
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:06.040]   You're the guy.
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:06.520]   No, I'm not.
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:06.800]   Yeah, I know.
[00:02:06.800 --> 00:02:07.520]   I don't mind doing it.
[00:02:07.520 --> 00:02:10.400]   It's just that, you know, it would be nice if we actually made some money.
[00:02:10.400 --> 00:02:15.880]   Oh, I think I've been complaining about this with Adam too.
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:19.000]   And now he says, you know, of course, Adam doesn't need any money,
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:20.400]   so it doesn't make any difference to him.
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:25.200]   But, you know, I have some very good news that advertising is starting to come in on a regular basis.
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.440]   In fact, I just had the conversation, which I would actually open up to the floor about
[00:02:30.440 --> 00:02:36.000]   how many ads we could have in the longer shows, this show and Mac break weekly, which both
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   go over an hour.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:43.680]   And I have said two commercials per show and Podtrack is saying we couldn't sell three.
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:44.680]   Can you do three?
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.880]   And I'm thinking three, three, it's not bad.
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:48.080]   We'll keep them one minute long.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:48.680]   That's not bad.
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.400]   Three minutes out of the way.
[00:02:49.400 --> 00:02:52.400]   Yeah, well, that wouldn't be bad except for one simple fact.
[00:02:52.400 --> 00:02:53.400]   What's that?
[00:02:53.400 --> 00:02:55.400]   One minute long.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.760]   Is that possible with Leo?
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:58.040]   You watch.
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:01.600]   You watch the new Leo.
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:04.960]   The new fast talking Leo is going to tell you everything about it is to know about our advertisers
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:09.160]   today without pausing for a breath.
[00:03:09.160 --> 00:03:10.240]   And Leo, that's just with one.
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:11.480]   That's just with Podtrack.
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:14.800]   There's two or three others I could probably, you know, put more in.
[00:03:14.800 --> 00:03:19.360]   I know that we're getting, you know, my show is now finally booked up.
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:25.600]   Actually, Andrew talks faster than you naturally.
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.520]   I think ad sales are going to be bad.
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:28.520]   Nobody cares about that.
[00:03:28.520 --> 00:03:29.520]   But I do.
[00:03:29.520 --> 00:03:33.240]   But just if you care to the extent that you care that your favorite shows are going to
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:37.200]   stick around, I think things are going, things are kind of, despite the economic downturn,
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:38.200]   things are kind of turning out.
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.880]   Now, John, you said that we're going to have a depression by 2010.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:41.880]   Is that still on?
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:42.880]   Oh, yeah.
[00:03:42.880 --> 00:03:43.880]   And no change.
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.360]   Well, that's the beginning of the depression.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.520]   The depression actually is a long term thing.
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:50.120]   And it hits rock bottom in 2013.
[00:03:50.120 --> 00:03:54.040]   Now, Andrew, you're actually an investment advisor.
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.760]   Do you agree with this?
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:04:00.240]   You know, I think that it's interesting because John and I have talked about this many times.
[00:04:00.240 --> 00:04:05.040]   And I question always, if in fact all the stars are aligning and everything looks like
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:09.920]   2009, 2010, or, you know, give them a few days or so here and there, that everything
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:12.040]   is going to just fall apart.
[00:04:12.040 --> 00:04:15.560]   Wouldn't we, you know, kind of be smart enough to get out in advance?
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.920]   And then the question is, isn't that what maybe is happening right now?
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:24.600]   Are we kind of going through the process of lightening up on stocks and various other
[00:04:24.600 --> 00:04:25.600]   investments?
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:30.440]   And I've mentioned this to Andrew before, which is that my crackpot theories doesn't
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.600]   mean everyone's going to start bailing out for one reason or another.
[00:04:32.600 --> 00:04:33.600]   I'm sure other people have.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.160]   But let's go back to 1987 when we had this out of the blue stock market crash, which
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:45.520]   took place on an 80 year cycle and I best reflected in recent memory with the 1907 depression.
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:52.880]   And there were a number of people who had spotted this 80 year cycle and were out and
[00:04:52.880 --> 00:04:56.240]   there were a lot of investment counselors that were talking about getting out and,
[00:04:56.240 --> 00:04:58.920]   you know, don't be in the market in 1987.
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:00.440]   And there was no real reason for it.
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:02.400]   The market was pretty fresh.
[00:05:02.400 --> 00:05:06.240]   It was happening, you know, we're in the upturn overall because, you know, we started
[00:05:06.240 --> 00:05:10.800]   a new era and but they were out and the thing did have this weird crash, whichever a lot
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:13.160]   of people completely panicked over.
[00:05:13.160 --> 00:05:18.800]   And it was just out of the blue and I'm convinced that there's a number of old timers that
[00:05:18.800 --> 00:05:22.360]   already know about the cycle as it exists.
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:24.680]   And they're in and out all the time because of it.
[00:05:24.680 --> 00:05:25.680]   It's not a norm.
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:26.680]   It happens.
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:27.680]   It has a bunch of legs to it.
[00:05:27.680 --> 00:05:32.880]   It's not like, you know, I mean, there's a number of, it's a 40 year, you take a 40
[00:05:32.880 --> 00:05:37.280]   year eon and there's a number of moments within those 40 years where you have the market
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:42.320]   to go make these kind of semi crashes and then you have the depression at the end of
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.320]   it at all.
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:47.000]   But aren't, I mean, not clearly we're going through something right now.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:50.680]   I don't know if it's the Harmanger or something bigger, but it does seem like tech companies
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:56.360]   are surviving and do in some cases doing okay even very well in some cases.
[00:05:56.360 --> 00:06:00.680]   Is that, are they just laggards or are we going to see a downturn in tech as well in
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:01.680]   the next?
[00:06:01.680 --> 00:06:06.040]   No, we're going to see a boom before we see this crash I'm talking about.
[00:06:06.040 --> 00:06:07.040]   Oh, really?
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:08.040]   Yeah.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:09.280]   Oh, so this isn't the beginning of the end.
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:10.280]   This is the thing of the.
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:14.320]   I mean, Andrew thinks it isn't everybody in the market does because they're, you know,
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:17.760]   they're very clued into the day to day, you know, a minute.
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:19.800]   I don't think this is what you're saying.
[00:06:19.800 --> 00:06:21.640]   This is a problem.
[00:06:21.640 --> 00:06:23.440]   You're more a long term thinker, John.
[00:06:23.440 --> 00:06:24.600]   You're planning for the future.
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:26.680]   No, no, I'm not even that I have.
[00:06:26.680 --> 00:06:30.120]   I'm a cyclicist or whatever you want to call it.
[00:06:30.120 --> 00:06:31.120]   A cyclic.
[00:06:31.120 --> 00:06:34.440]   A bice, a by not a cyclist because that's a kind of bicycle, but whatever the case is
[00:06:34.440 --> 00:06:39.760]   not with you like the helmet like Obama bicycling down the street was a good image.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:45.760]   Anyway, so talk about a perfunctory.
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:47.960]   You can't have a crash without it without a boom.
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:48.960]   So I mean, I'm expecting a boom.
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.080]   Here's what I'd like to see to make it clear to everybody.
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:54.160]   Dow Jones 30,000.
[00:06:54.160 --> 00:06:55.160]   Enough said.
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:56.160]   Wow.
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:06:59.320]   And when it hurts, it hits 30,000 sell like a crazy man.
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:00.320]   Yeah.
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:01.480]   Yeah.
[00:07:01.480 --> 00:07:07.360]   I think I, John's over there putting in putting in this the by orders.
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.360]   What do you think, Will Harris?
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:11.600]   Here in Britain, you don't have a stock market.
[00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:12.600]   Yeah.
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.000]   You have the East India company.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:17.720]   I reckon that's Jerry Yang's justification.
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:21.080]   We can't crash guys, but we haven't boomed yet.
[00:07:21.080 --> 00:07:24.760]   Wait, the problem is Jerry Yang is driving with the rear view mirror.
[00:07:24.760 --> 00:07:28.480]   He's stealing, steering the car with the rear view mirror saying, we're on track.
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.480]   No problem.
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:33.520]   I'd go so far saying his blindfold on.
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:35.320]   And he's wearing gloves.
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:36.320]   Right.
[00:07:36.320 --> 00:07:37.320]   So let's talk about that.
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:38.320]   Sorry, the week, of course.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:41.880]   And in fact, we did some live breaking coverage of it.
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:47.360]   Jason Calicanis on Mike Harrington kind of broke this and tanked the Yahoo stock earlier
[00:07:47.360 --> 00:07:51.280]   this week when he said Yahoo and Google are about to do an ad deal.
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:55.640]   In fact, Harrington even implied there might be a search deal involved.
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:08:01.440]   Reuters picked the story up and Yahoo stock.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:05.640]   And I don't even know if it's come back yet, but it turned out somewhat was true that in
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:07.240]   fact, Yahoo and Google did do a deal.
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.800]   I guess somewhat similar, Andrew, to the deal that they had the trial that they had
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:13.040]   done a few weeks earlier.
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:14.200]   It looks like an ad sense deal.
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:18.000]   I mean, it's so lame placing Google ads on Yahoo search results.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   Right.
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:20.160]   I mean, isn't that is not AdSense?
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:21.160]   Yeah.
[00:08:21.160 --> 00:08:22.160]   Yahoo's buying AdSense.
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:23.160]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:24.160]   It's not buying.
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:25.160]   They're using AdSense.
[00:08:25.160 --> 00:08:27.160]   They've lined up with a publisher.
[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:28.160]   Yeah.
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:29.160]   Get rid of the poker in the world.
[00:08:29.160 --> 00:08:32.200]   Isn't that kind of a mission that it's not going so well?
[00:08:32.200 --> 00:08:33.720]   I'm thinking, ah, it's not.
[00:08:33.720 --> 00:08:34.720]   It's not good.
[00:08:34.720 --> 00:08:39.480]   They're going to do their blogs, you know, they'll get a couple of the plug-ins.
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:44.280]   But you know, it's interesting because if you really think about it for a second, it's
[00:08:44.280 --> 00:08:50.320]   if Yahoo is doing this and Yahoo was so against opening up any discussions with Microsoft,
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:51.600]   don't you want to scratch?
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:55.800]   You hadn't just say, what was it that Yahoo didn't want to show?
[00:08:55.800 --> 00:09:02.160]   And is it so bad that they're doing this amateurish kind of ad sense deal to try to
[00:09:02.160 --> 00:09:08.200]   just get results for some income anyway they can, which again, infers that they have nothing
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:09.200]   going on?
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:13.040]   Well, I think, I think Andrew also touched on something else.
[00:09:13.040 --> 00:09:14.920]   I mean, there's always the issue.
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:19.280]   You know, you see this every so often where a company actually may have had some offer
[00:09:19.280 --> 00:09:25.280]   that's pretty cool, but in the process of due diligence in the execution of the deal,
[00:09:25.280 --> 00:09:29.040]   something may be there may be, you know, a skeleton in the closet.
[00:09:29.040 --> 00:09:33.360]   And so you don't want to do these deals because there may be something lurking that could
[00:09:33.360 --> 00:09:36.560]   be, you know, a result in lawsuits or I mean, who knows?
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:37.560]   Let's speculate.
[00:09:37.560 --> 00:09:38.720]   What would it be?
[00:09:38.720 --> 00:09:42.160]   I don't know, but I do know the one thing where they were Microsoft offered them, you
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:47.920]   know, even more money in January of 2007, which if, you know, if Yahoo doesn't do something
[00:09:47.920 --> 00:09:52.720]   pretty soon with somebody, that's going to come out, show up as a massive shareholder
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:54.200]   lawsuit and all the board members.
[00:09:54.200 --> 00:09:55.200]   What do you mean they are?
[00:09:55.200 --> 00:10:00.280]   They made an offer to them in excess of the $31 they offered most recently a year, a year
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:06.560]   and a half ago in January of 2007, they offered them 40 over, they offered them $40 a share.
[00:10:06.560 --> 00:10:07.560]   Why was it?
[00:10:07.560 --> 00:10:08.560]   That didn't come out in public.
[00:10:08.560 --> 00:10:09.560]   It did.
[00:10:09.560 --> 00:10:10.560]   It was all over the news.
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:11.560]   You missed it.
[00:10:11.560 --> 00:10:12.560]   Really?
[00:10:12.560 --> 00:10:15.840]   They offered us $40 a share for, oh no, it was like $40.
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:20.680]   No, no, no, it was $40 and and and T. Boone Pickens came out and made the comment that he
[00:10:20.680 --> 00:10:25.240]   would not want to be on the Yahoo board of directors if any of this is true.
[00:10:25.240 --> 00:10:30.880]   Well, apparently was true and now they've essentially fought off Microsoft again and Microsoft
[00:10:30.880 --> 00:10:35.840]   came to the, apparently last weekend had meetings with the Yahoo board of directors and which
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:39.400]   ended up in Microsoft saying we withdraw the offer at any price.
[00:10:39.400 --> 00:10:41.400]   We're not interested by.
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:44.520]   You know what's interesting about that $40 January 2007 thing?
[00:10:44.520 --> 00:10:49.240]   That is the year we were doing the show then and for a few months afterwards and that's
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:53.520]   when the first rumors of the Microsoft Yahoo, the Microsoft's going to buy you remember
[00:10:53.520 --> 00:10:54.520]   that?
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:55.520]   But I thought it was a rumor.
[00:10:55.520 --> 00:10:57.560]   I didn't know that that was actually wrong.
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:01.520]   It was a rumor and only the offers come out to light recently because they were somebody
[00:11:01.520 --> 00:11:05.640]   was digging around and they, or somebody at Microsoft let it slip.
[00:11:05.640 --> 00:11:09.960]   Who knows what but that's apparently that rumor was based on this particular deal that
[00:11:09.960 --> 00:11:12.960]   never happened.
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:17.440]   This doesn't, Mr. Icon is going to be very unhappy with Mr. Yang.
[00:11:17.440 --> 00:11:19.600]   Well now, now, okay, let's talk about Carl Icon.
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:20.600]   Where is he and all this?
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:25.080]   He's been, of course, Sabre Rawlings going to the shareholders saying, let's vote out
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:26.320]   the board.
[00:11:26.320 --> 00:11:28.200]   Let's get a new board and let's make this happen.
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:30.800]   Well, that's over right because Microsoft isn't it?
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.800]   Has Microsoft pulled away?
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:34.800]   Well, you never know.
[00:11:34.800 --> 00:11:39.080]   If, if, if Carl Icon came and replaced the entire Yahoo board, which let's face it with
[00:11:39.080 --> 00:11:44.040]   the amount of sort of shareholder feeling at the moment is not entirely implausible.
[00:11:44.040 --> 00:11:47.920]   You could quite easily just walk back across to Microsoft and say, you know what, 30 bucks,
[00:11:47.920 --> 00:11:49.640]   35 bucks, let's go for it.
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:51.640]   Hey, 20 bucks at this point.
[00:11:51.640 --> 00:11:56.680]   Because, you know, Yahoo's stock is not, you know, I think most people would say that
[00:11:56.680 --> 00:11:59.720]   it's not going to go anywhere in the next six months.
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:01.120]   You know, what have they got?
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:04.480]   Unless this Google deal turns out to add absolutely tons to their revenue.
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:07.480]   But even then, you know, it's such a short term deal.
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:11.840]   There's, it's not a, you know, the Google AdSense deal for one of a better term is,
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:14.040]   not really sustainable for Yahoo's business is it?
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:17.240]   Because it's just admitting that their core business is no business.
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:20.760]   Yeah, they're, they're, they're make, it's not as though the company's going broke or
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:22.960]   they don't have any income or revenue.
[00:12:22.960 --> 00:12:26.880]   The thing about the icon thing, I wrote about this by the way in market watch, I specifically
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:31.440]   went over all the board members of that currently exist and all the board members suggested by
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:32.440]   Carl Icon.
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:36.520]   And it was apparent to me that it was very risky for the shareholders to vote these
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:38.360]   icon people in.
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:42.640]   Because if some deal doesn't happen, even with them in there, you know, maybe Microsoft
[00:12:42.640 --> 00:12:44.520]   decides this changes their mind.
[00:12:44.520 --> 00:12:49.360]   I mean, there's no guarantee these guys cannot run a high tech company.
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:50.360]   That's the problem.
[00:12:50.360 --> 00:12:53.360]   And then the company would just deteriorate rapidly.
[00:12:53.360 --> 00:12:56.800]   In this latest action, Yahoo's price fell.
[00:12:56.800 --> 00:13:00.360]   Now it's down to 23 bucks and 47 cents.
[00:13:00.360 --> 00:13:04.280]   Oh, that's after, that's after the, you know, action this week.
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:07.760]   I mean, I have to say at some point, I mean, it's not the, it's not the low for the year.
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:10.760]   But it was a lot lower before the offer was made.
[00:13:10.760 --> 00:13:15.240]   But by the way, this is the Yahoo is estimating that this deal with Google, this AdSense deal
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:19.600]   is going to increase their revenue by about 800 million per 800 million.
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.600]   Is that a lot?
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.720]   Compared to 45 billion.
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:24.680]   I'll take the 45 billion.
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:29.560]   Yeah, 800 million seems like a small amount compared to what they were.
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:34.360]   And of course, the interesting thing about that deal is my carrington wrote pretty insightful
[00:13:34.360 --> 00:13:39.600]   on TechCrunch was that there are so many penalties to getting out of it and so many clauses
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:42.120]   and ways in which the deal can sort of be next.
[00:13:42.120 --> 00:13:47.440]   It's like Yahoo doesn't have to talk about the micro who deal or the Google who you.
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:51.720]   The Google who deal or the you who.
[00:13:51.720 --> 00:13:53.280]   I like Google.
[00:13:53.280 --> 00:14:00.000]   And, you know, Yahoo doesn't have to place the ads, but if it doesn't generate something
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.400]   like, you know, 90 million a quarter or something, then Google can terminate the deal.
[00:14:04.400 --> 00:14:10.880]   If as little as 30% of Yahoo gets sold off to any third party, Google can terminate and
[00:14:10.880 --> 00:14:14.600]   Yahoo will have to pay them a quarter of a billion dollars.
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:19.040]   And everyone in the sort of commentary was this is basically this almost nothing in it
[00:14:19.040 --> 00:14:23.680]   for Google beyond maybe a perfunctory, you know, quarter of a billion here or there.
[00:14:23.680 --> 00:14:27.120]   You mean, you mean, that's basically it's basically in favor.
[00:14:27.120 --> 00:14:29.640]   Nothing in it for Google or nothing in it for Yahoo.
[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:34.640]   I mean, 80 million a quarter to them is like, you know, whatever.
[00:14:34.640 --> 00:14:38.600]   So, I mean, originally, everybody thought that Google agreed to this first trial as
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:41.440]   a way a poison pill to keep Microsoft.
[00:14:41.440 --> 00:14:43.520]   Google really didn't want the micro who deal.
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:47.520]   They really didn't want Microsoft to buy Yahoo for whatever reason.
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:51.640]   So that's what the thinking was that Google was in bed with Yahoo to prevent this.
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:54.120]   But now that the Microsoft deals off the table, they're still going ahead.
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:55.600]   There must be something in it for them.
[00:14:55.600 --> 00:14:57.240]   Well, they're probably still worried that the deals.
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:01.480]   I mean, it's just because somebody says it's off the table doesn't mean it'll be not
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:02.480]   reintroduced.
[00:15:02.480 --> 00:15:04.200]   They're still worried about it.
[00:15:04.200 --> 00:15:05.200]   I would be.
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:09.120]   I mean, if I was concerned, I personally think that if Microsoft did this deal, it would
[00:15:09.120 --> 00:15:10.120]   be the end of Microsoft.
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:11.720]   I mean, I don't think Google should go.
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:13.200]   Yeah, you guys go ahead.
[00:15:13.200 --> 00:15:14.200]   You go off mate.
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:17.320]   But the problem is you never know and it's not worth the risk.
[00:15:17.320 --> 00:15:21.880]   Yeah, at this point, though, it's not it's really the risk has risen tremendously and
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:23.960]   risk for a really shown there.
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:24.960]   It's shown their stuff here.
[00:15:24.960 --> 00:15:30.160]   You know, if you remember the end of the movie Casino, where all the mobsters are going around,
[00:15:30.160 --> 00:15:34.560]   who they're going to kill at the end, and there's this one guy that's their best pal
[00:15:34.560 --> 00:15:35.560]   lawyer guy.
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:37.640]   And at the very end, they guys said, yeah, he's okay.
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:38.640]   Don't worry about him.
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:43.160]   Everybody except the guy at the very end says, eh, why take a chance?
[00:15:43.160 --> 00:15:45.360]   I kill him anyway.
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:47.040]   Jeez.
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:48.960]   This is a hardcore business.
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:55.760]   But now the big question gang is now that Microsoft has this giant wallet and they are
[00:15:55.760 --> 00:15:58.400]   scratching to itch and to spend some money.
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:01.600]   Who is going to be the acquisition targets?
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:02.600]   You know, what is Microsoft?
[00:16:02.600 --> 00:16:03.600]   Because they're going to do it.
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:04.600]   They're going to spend.
[00:16:04.600 --> 00:16:10.720]   They're going to now try to build that the eyeball and the ads revenue up without the
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:11.720]   Yahoo.
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:13.280]   My bets on the Twitter network.
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:18.160]   I should call you the best place to buy ads on the internet.
[00:16:18.160 --> 00:16:23.600]   Hey, by the way, we are doing a survey on the website with our agency pod track trying
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:26.640]   to find out who the hell is listening to the show.
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:28.040]   These things are very useful for us.
[00:16:28.040 --> 00:16:31.600]   And one of the things we will ask you is how many ads you think we should run and all
[00:16:31.600 --> 00:16:32.600]   that stuff.
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:36.360]   But if you would do me a favor and go to TWIT.tv and just take that survey test, take a minute
[00:16:36.360 --> 00:16:40.600]   or two, it's very useful for us to know who we're talking to.
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:44.480]   I thought you were going to say it would be very useful for you to go and say we should
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:46.040]   run 10 ads.
[00:16:46.040 --> 00:16:47.040]   That would be useful.
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:49.920]   Please just put in a note about how many ads you could live with.
[00:16:49.920 --> 00:16:54.360]   I don't even want to do three, but I think that given all the money I've spent on these
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:55.360]   cameras and lights.
[00:16:55.360 --> 00:16:56.920]   Oh, yeah, that's a tip.
[00:16:56.920 --> 00:16:58.920]   You paid for those already out of your pocket.
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:03.400]   You have more money in your wallet than the rest of us have combined.
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:04.400]   Oh, yeah, John.
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:06.200]   John's being very complimentary.
[00:17:06.200 --> 00:17:08.200]   You know, I have to say that TWIT Live stuff is the video.
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:09.200]   Stuff's gone very well.
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:14.000]   We had our first 10,000 viewer day on Monday when the iPhone announcement came out.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:20.920]   10,000 viewers, if I could get that on a consistent basis, we'd be as profitable as CNBC.
[00:17:20.920 --> 00:17:22.640]   I could sit back and relax.
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.160]   I could buy Yahoo.
[00:17:24.160 --> 00:17:28.640]   After you and I talk, I speak on my podcast.
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:33.040]   I opened the browser and I watched the things that you were doing and you were talking about.
[00:17:33.040 --> 00:17:39.360]   It's kind of addicting watching you, just kind of in life talking just openly and explaining
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:40.360]   things.
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:41.760]   It's kind of creepy, don't you think?
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:46.040]   I think there is a natural voyeuristic tendency that we all have.
[00:17:46.040 --> 00:17:49.080]   I don't think it's addictive unless you're really hard up for drugs.
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:50.600]   Well, I thought it was interesting.
[00:17:50.600 --> 00:17:52.000]   We got up to go upstairs and think it does.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:53.600]   We have a camera in the bathroom.
[00:17:53.600 --> 00:17:55.280]   We're working on it, Andrew.
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:17:58.840]   Actually, we're going to come in here and when we do the final TWIT Live page, there will
[00:17:58.840 --> 00:18:01.720]   be a little spy cam page that's so motion sensitive.
[00:18:01.720 --> 00:18:05.120]   So as anybody, any of us, Dana, I forgot to tell you about this.
[00:18:05.120 --> 00:18:07.080]   Dane's going, what are you talking about?
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:12.040]   As any of us move through the TWIT cottage, you will see ghostly impressions of us moving
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:14.040]   around.
[00:18:14.040 --> 00:18:15.040]   Just to make it more addictive.
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:18.280]   Yeah, you should be able to get into people magazine with this one.
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:19.380]   That's my goal.
[00:18:19.380 --> 00:18:20.380]   You know that, John.
[00:18:20.380 --> 00:18:22.180]   That's all I've really ever wanted.
[00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:23.180]   Just one spread and people.
[00:18:23.180 --> 00:18:27.280]   I just want to be on the cover as the world's sexiest man and then I can retire.
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:28.280]   What is it?
[00:18:28.280 --> 00:18:31.480]   Well, can we go back to the iPhone 3G announcement for a second?
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:32.480]   Oh, yeah.
[00:18:32.480 --> 00:18:33.480]   Let's finish up Google, Haggle.
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:34.480]   Wait a minute.
[00:18:34.480 --> 00:18:36.560]   I want to finish up micro-hugle Gagal, you who.
[00:18:36.560 --> 00:18:38.800]   And then we'll go, there is that little new phone thing.
[00:18:38.800 --> 00:18:40.920]   We'll talk about that.
[00:18:40.920 --> 00:18:45.360]   Anything else to say about micro-hugle, Google, Gagal, Yahoo?
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:47.280]   Yahoo, Google, Google?
[00:18:47.280 --> 00:18:51.280]   Well, I think it's only that Icons lost his shirt so far, isn't it?
[00:18:51.280 --> 00:18:52.280]   It's cost him money.
[00:18:52.280 --> 00:18:53.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:18:53.760 --> 00:18:57.480]   Because he bought, he would go long on Yahoo.
[00:18:57.480 --> 00:18:58.480]   What happened?
[00:18:58.480 --> 00:18:59.480]   How did he lose his shirt?
[00:18:59.480 --> 00:19:00.480]   He tried to buy up.
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:01.480]   You guys, they were all rallying around there.
[00:19:01.480 --> 00:19:04.840]   Remember, they're all on CNBC and they're all talking about how they're behind Icon.
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:09.040]   This guy put in what 10 million shares and this guy bought 10 million shares.
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:12.320]   They're all struck their stuff because they think they're just going there and powerfully
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:13.320]   just push it.
[00:19:13.320 --> 00:19:19.560]   But the fact is he's lost about five bucks a share or more or more, 50 million out.
[00:19:19.560 --> 00:19:25.400]   Now, I think the one thing that's the final sort of thing to say on Yahoo is that if you're
[00:19:25.400 --> 00:19:29.600]   who's going to get anywhere in the next 12 months, it really needs to define what the
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:30.840]   heck it is.
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:37.440]   I think if you saw Yang on stage with the De-conference and he can't answer the simplest question
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.640]   of what is Yahoo?
[00:19:39.640 --> 00:19:42.800]   Is it an investor, a content engine?
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:44.720]   It's my company.
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:45.720]   It's my company.
[00:19:45.720 --> 00:19:49.040]   Well, that's his answer is that it's this thing that I built.
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:50.040]   But what is it?
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:51.040]   Where are you going to make money?
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:55.000]   And so I think for Yahoo, the next six months is like, come up with a strategy to get a
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:57.040]   core product and make some money.
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:58.880]   But we'll let you admit it.
[00:19:58.880 --> 00:20:02.680]   If we were in the same shoes, we wouldn't really have much to say either.
[00:20:02.680 --> 00:20:05.880]   What's your strategy for making money?
[00:20:05.880 --> 00:20:06.880]   Me?
[00:20:06.880 --> 00:20:09.880]   I guess I'm on the lead.
[00:20:09.880 --> 00:20:13.760]   It's step three profit.
[00:20:13.760 --> 00:20:14.760]   Exactly.
[00:20:14.760 --> 00:20:16.600]   These guys make money.
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:17.760]   They're not making enough money.
[00:20:17.760 --> 00:20:18.760]   That's the problem.
[00:20:18.760 --> 00:20:19.760]   Yeah.
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:20.760]   No, they make plenty of money.
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:22.520]   Now, how long does it have a Deadpool?
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:26.120]   How long before Jerry Yang is out on the street?
[00:20:26.120 --> 00:20:27.120]   John C. Devorak.
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:28.720]   What do you mean by out on the street?
[00:20:28.720 --> 00:20:30.720]   Out, out, out at Yahoo.
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:32.640]   No longer out of the company.
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:36.240]   Well, maybe they give them an honorary seat on the board or something.
[00:20:36.240 --> 00:20:37.600]   They'll usually do that.
[00:20:37.600 --> 00:20:39.800]   They usually leave the guy in as a chairman.
[00:20:39.800 --> 00:20:42.760]   Chairman, but they had other chairman in the meantime.
[00:20:42.760 --> 00:20:47.600]   I'm not seeing, unless they can find somebody to take his place.
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.760]   Which nobody wants that job, right?
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:51.760]   You'd take that job.
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:52.760]   Who wouldn't?
[00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:53.760]   I mean, it's got to be a great job.
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:54.760]   There's an option.
[00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:56.320]   There's stuff you could do with Yahoo.
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:01.200]   Well, I think the real problem, and I hate to point the finger at any particular person
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:04.240]   there, but I think it's Susan Decker.
[00:21:04.240 --> 00:21:06.840]   She's the merger and acquisition woman they brought.
[00:21:06.840 --> 00:21:09.960]   Yeah, and I think the reason she was brought in was to do a deal.
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:12.200]   She's got to go.
[00:21:12.200 --> 00:21:14.200]   She's got to go.
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:18.760]   She's the one that was actually coming up with a plan and the answer when Jerry Yang
[00:21:18.760 --> 00:21:23.160]   couldn't answer the question of what their purpose and mission and their total plan was.
[00:21:23.160 --> 00:21:27.200]   At least she has something concrete to talk about and to say, I mean, I'll be the smartest
[00:21:27.200 --> 00:21:28.200]   girl in the room.
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:33.800]   I'm not saying that's not true, but she's not cut out for this particular job except unless
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:36.720]   they were going to do some deal because that's what she does.
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:37.880]   And so now they're not going to do a deal.
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:40.480]   She's not a sales person and they need some sales guys in the front.
[00:21:40.480 --> 00:21:45.600]   I said a long time ago that Dan Rosenswijk should have been in her position.
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:47.400]   You should have gotten the president's job.
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:48.400]   I mean, he's a sales guy.
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:50.840]   Are we like, there's a smart guy, yeah.
[00:21:50.840 --> 00:21:54.880]   A smart guy is probably as smart as she is and obviously not quite as smart as they got
[00:21:54.880 --> 00:21:56.960]   rid of him and she moved up.
[00:21:56.960 --> 00:22:00.560]   So she's probably smarter, but that doesn't mean that she can do what he can do, which
[00:22:00.560 --> 00:22:02.360]   is sell, sell, sell.
[00:22:02.360 --> 00:22:07.440]   And they need a guy who's like a sales oriented as all he thinks and breathes, although I
[00:22:07.440 --> 00:22:08.440]   haven't talked to him for a while.
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:10.280]   In fact, he was supposed to return my call recently.
[00:22:10.280 --> 00:22:11.280]   He never did.
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.920]   Hey Dan, we're calling you man.
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:16.480]   Yeah, you know what he's got and too big for that kind of thing for to call the little
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:17.480]   people anymore.
[00:22:17.480 --> 00:22:18.480]   His old friends.
[00:22:18.480 --> 00:22:22.640]   He died the point to still, I still believe he still thinks and breathes sales, which
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:24.880]   means he should be in that job, but he's gone.
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:25.880]   I don't know what he's like.
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:29.400]   He's like, he's like working in some, you know, like a venture capital.
[00:22:29.400 --> 00:22:30.400]   That's another problem going on.
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:31.400]   Yeah.
[00:22:31.400 --> 00:22:32.400]   Major brain drain.
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:34.880]   They had three major big executives leave to this week.
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:37.840]   I mean, it's like, well, the last person of Yahoo, turn out the lights.
[00:22:37.840 --> 00:22:41.520]   Terry Semmel, the former CEO, the guy who gave up his seat that Jerry and currently
[00:22:41.520 --> 00:22:45.680]   holds is probably going, got to get rid of the nick of time.
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:46.840]   I think is he writing a book?
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:49.560]   How many said he's going to write a book?
[00:22:49.560 --> 00:22:51.200]   That would be an interesting book.
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:56.320]   It probably won't be, but you know, he's the one largely responsible for the company
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:57.320]   going on track.
[00:22:57.320 --> 00:23:00.880]   Well, I mean, he came in and it looked like he was saving the company, but it's the Hollywood
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:01.880]   guy.
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.840]   He's the Hollywood guy's going to turn into a media property and we're going to do a
[00:23:04.840 --> 00:23:07.760]   lot of production of this and then they never over Yahoo.
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:12.500]   They've tried to do media stuff constantly from that finance view, whether the heck
[00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:14.920]   it was back in the tech TV days.
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:18.200]   I kind of like that the Yahoo finance channel and isn't Yahoo finance.
[00:23:18.200 --> 00:23:20.200]   I mean, that's what I'm looking at when I look at stock prices.
[00:23:20.200 --> 00:23:22.240]   Isn't that still one of the most visited?
[00:23:22.240 --> 00:23:24.840]   Oh, when I go for the stationary site.
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:25.840]   Yeah, I think it's.
[00:23:25.840 --> 00:23:26.840]   That's a great.
[00:23:26.840 --> 00:23:27.840]   That's what we're looking at right now.
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:28.840]   Right.
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:33.600]   And they do have some videos that are okay, but the fact of the matter is.
[00:23:33.600 --> 00:23:36.120]   He wanted to make it tell an IPTV play.
[00:23:36.120 --> 00:23:39.720]   Well, IPTV or Hollywood or movies or short vid.
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:41.480]   I don't know what they were thinking to be honest about.
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:42.480]   Never made any sense to me.
[00:23:42.480 --> 00:23:45.200]   It was a search engine directory from the get go.
[00:23:45.200 --> 00:23:48.520]   Why are you going to turn into some kind of a Hollywood thing?
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:49.520]   You know, it is.
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:53.240]   Not what CBS is now doing with its CNET acquisition, all the other acquisitions.
[00:23:53.240 --> 00:23:56.880]   It looks like it's trying to do that IPTV kind of thing.
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:23:57.880]   Not sure.
[00:23:57.880 --> 00:23:58.880]   Not sure either.
[00:23:58.880 --> 00:24:02.240]   So, yes, but at the same point, it's going to be a search company as well.
[00:24:02.240 --> 00:24:03.240]   Right.
[00:24:03.240 --> 00:24:04.360]   Is Yahoo still a search company?
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:07.120]   Is that still important to Yahoo's core business?
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:10.000]   I think it's the only thing they're making money on consistently.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:15.120]   There's still a lot of users of Yahoo's search.
[00:24:15.120 --> 00:24:18.280]   I mean, even when we were at tech TV, I used to when I was doing the, what was it, show
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:20.080]   I did the big thinkers.
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:20.840]   Big thinkers, yeah.
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:25.880]   I would always ask these guys, these big thinkers, and this is about 1990, 90 recall.
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:30.400]   I would ask every one of them, and this is when Google had already really was the best
[00:24:30.400 --> 00:24:31.640]   thing going, was Google.
[00:24:31.640 --> 00:24:32.960]   We all used it.
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:36.520]   And I would always ask these guys, there were all kinds of walks of life and a lot of
[00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:38.480]   them very into the tech scene.
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:41.160]   I'd always ask them at the end, what search engine do you use?
[00:24:41.160 --> 00:24:43.360]   And they would all say Yahoo.
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:48.480]   And my favorite part is then you would stand up, slap them and call and say, phony.
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:49.880]   I loved that, John.
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:51.280]   That was your trademark for so long.
[00:24:51.280 --> 00:24:52.280]   I really.
[00:24:52.280 --> 00:24:53.280]   It was a good one.
[00:24:53.280 --> 00:24:55.680]   And then slap it plus the screaming phony.
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:56.680]   Pony.
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:57.680]   But my, yeah.
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:58.680]   No, but you're right.
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:00.200]   That was, that was, but I think you're right.
[00:25:00.200 --> 00:25:03.600]   There's still people who use MSN for their primary search tool.
[00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:04.600]   Yeah.
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:05.600]   Well, search.
[00:25:05.600 --> 00:25:06.600]   Right.
[00:25:06.600 --> 00:25:07.600]   AO.
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.440]   People don't move.
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:14.200]   We amongst ourselves, we see our, you know, we're kind of in the scene and we, you know,
[00:25:14.200 --> 00:25:15.440]   jump from one thing to another.
[00:25:15.440 --> 00:25:18.600]   Or in your case, you jump on every single thing that shows up.
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:19.600]   Oh, yeah.
[00:25:19.600 --> 00:25:22.600]   I'm using a new search tool called Flugelhorn.
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:23.600]   I love it anyway.
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:24.840]   I don't want to get into it.
[00:25:24.840 --> 00:25:30.120]   But the point is, is that we assume other people are this adventure someone and the fact
[00:25:30.120 --> 00:25:32.360]   is very few people are adventure something.
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:36.480]   They get their routine online and then still most people just go online for a few hours
[00:25:36.480 --> 00:25:37.480]   a week.
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:40.600]   They're not online all the time or have a camera sticking in their face like you do
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:41.600]   24/7.
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:42.600]   No, it's a really good point.
[00:25:42.600 --> 00:25:49.800]   And I think we get so insular here, you know, tech pundits that we forget that the vast majority
[00:25:49.800 --> 00:25:54.560]   of users is not included or even aware of the kind of stuff we're talking about.
[00:25:54.560 --> 00:25:55.560]   Here's a good example.
[00:25:55.560 --> 00:25:57.200]   Dig or Yahoo buzz.
[00:25:57.200 --> 00:25:59.160]   Yahoo buzz is huge.
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:00.320]   It's much bigger than dig.
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:05.040]   We all talk about dig like it's the second coming, but Yahoo buzz just because it's Yahoo.
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:06.040]   It's a destination.
[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:07.680]   Yahoo's destination is much bigger.
[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:08.960]   Well, that was the whole point.
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:09.960]   That was the whole point.
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:15.200]   You had an instant, you had an instant customers and you had instant eyeballs and a massive
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:19.440]   amount of people just by going in there and teaming up and that was the whole plan.
[00:26:19.440 --> 00:26:22.360]   But I can't Yahoo make some something out of this.
[00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:27.320]   I don't get it because they obviously they're competing with the giant.
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:31.840]   And even though they are second, supposedly, you know, to them, you know, they're competing
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:34.360]   with just a giant that everybody is Google.
[00:26:34.360 --> 00:26:35.360]   I mean, they just switched.
[00:26:35.360 --> 00:26:38.320]   But I will tell you to skip back to your question about, you know, the Deadpool, how
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:39.320]   long is it?
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:44.120]   How long for Jerry Yang from an investment standpoint and from an investor standpoint,
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:50.120]   there is going to be a tremendous amount of hesitation for anyone to be an investor and
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:56.440]   a new investor in Yahoo as long as Yang is there from the type of, you know, the type
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:27:02.600]   of immature attitude that he took where he was, you know, doing this from a touchy feely.
[00:27:02.600 --> 00:27:07.880]   It's my company rather than a bottom line number and taking care of the shareholders.
[00:27:07.880 --> 00:27:11.640]   I don't want to be a shareholder in a company when it's very clear that the person at the
[00:27:11.640 --> 00:27:13.720]   top is not thinking clearly.
[00:27:13.720 --> 00:27:14.720]   It's my company.
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:15.720]   It's my company.
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:16.720]   How about you, Will Harris?
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:21.880]   I think the other thing is that, you know, going back to this thing about, you know, what
[00:27:21.880 --> 00:27:23.080]   are they going to do?
[00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:28.280]   I think the thing that they don't really realize is that they think that search ads is the
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:29.520]   way they're going to make their money.
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:33.400]   Obviously, their search is kind of second rate to Google's.
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:38.920]   But they're doing these projects like, you know, like you say, like Yahoo buzz, which
[00:27:38.920 --> 00:27:41.800]   is massive and huge, which is really a content play.
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:44.920]   But the way to monetize content plays is through display advertising, but they don't
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:47.600]   seem to have anybody selling display advertising because they're all trying to sell search
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:48.600]   advertising.
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:52.200]   So the thing they're most successful at these content plays, they're not trying to monetize
[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:55.880]   and the stuff they're not so good at, which is the search stuff, they're trying to work
[00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:56.880]   really hard on.
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:59.280]   And it seems they're getting it the wrong way around.
[00:27:59.280 --> 00:28:02.320]   Twitter, 2001 in our chat room has said, there's nothing wrong with Yahoo.
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:07.200]   The only thing wrong is that a tech pun it's the press media us only pay attention to the
[00:28:07.200 --> 00:28:08.200]   top earner.
[00:28:08.200 --> 00:28:10.960]   We say Google, Google, Google, but Yahoo's doing just fine.
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:11.960]   Isn't that true?
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:16.240]   I mean, if I look at the stock price, Yahoo's low point was weight was way back in February.
[00:28:16.240 --> 00:28:19.480]   They were at 19 bucks, 1858.
[00:28:19.480 --> 00:28:24.080]   They're still well above that even after all the ups and downs of the micro who are
[00:28:24.080 --> 00:28:25.080]   they?
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:26.080]   Are they?
[00:28:26.080 --> 00:28:27.080]   Are they?
[00:28:27.080 --> 00:28:28.080]   Are they for regarding that comment?
[00:28:28.080 --> 00:28:29.080]   I agree with that.
[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:32.400]   I've been saying here and I've been saying it elsewhere.
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:35.520]   That said, I still think the stock's overpriced.
[00:28:35.520 --> 00:28:39.840]   They don't have the earnings growth that makes it a high multiple stock.
[00:28:39.840 --> 00:28:43.400]   It should probably be selling for about 15 bucks, to be honest about it.
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:47.240]   And they should probably be giving a dividend to the, to the, if they make money to the
[00:28:47.240 --> 00:28:48.240]   shareholders.
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.160]   That's why you'll never be a businessman.
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:51.160]   John, I'm sorry.
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:54.600]   I was trying to, I was telling Charlotte, I can't, I'm sorry.
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:55.600]   The other chart.
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:56.600]   I can't.
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:57.600]   It's the expert.
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:01.480]   Leo, that Charlie sent you on the shows, The Comparison of Google and Microsoft.
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:02.480]   Remember that one?
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:03.480]   Did you take a look at that?
[00:29:03.480 --> 00:29:04.480]   Yeah, let me pull that up for, for everybody.
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:09.160]   What's, what's really interesting is I think it's, I was actually, I was surprised myself,
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:14.760]   but over the last two years, Microsoft and Google have been neck and neck in terms of
[00:29:14.760 --> 00:29:16.960]   stock price and percentages of gain.
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:21.080]   I think if you would have thought about that, you, everybody thinks that Google is just,
[00:29:21.080 --> 00:29:24.800]   you know, this massive beast that just keeps on going up, even though it has some, you
[00:29:24.800 --> 00:29:25.800]   know, ups and downs here.
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:31.800]   Microsoft has been doing a great job and we, there, our second largest holding aside next
[00:29:31.800 --> 00:29:35.880]   to Apple is Microsoft and we're very pleased with the performance and, and the strategic
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:36.880]   sense.
[00:29:36.880 --> 00:29:40.720]   You know, it's, it's really in fashion to beat up Microsoft for everything, isn't it?
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:44.680]   It seems that, you know, if you want to say something positive, you almost want to, you
[00:29:44.680 --> 00:29:49.240]   know, who's listening, but Microsoft has been doing a, just a tremendous job at really
[00:29:49.240 --> 00:29:54.620]   turning this company from, you know, the square Volvo type of company into not a race car
[00:29:54.620 --> 00:29:59.040]   Porsche yet, but you know, at least getting towards maybe the, you know, the infinity.
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:04.160]   They're just much, much more in tune with moving forward and enhancing value, I believe,
[00:30:04.160 --> 00:30:07.560]   from, from, from a different sense that they were a number of years ago.
[00:30:07.560 --> 00:30:10.320]   And I think they're getting the hint that they need to do something significant and
[00:30:10.320 --> 00:30:14.560]   their share price reflects, I think all the things that they've done to be, you know,
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:16.720]   really on, on, on the right track.
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:22.480]   This chart, by the way, made with Yahoo Finance shows that Google and Microsoft, I did that
[00:30:22.480 --> 00:30:23.480]   on purpose.
[00:30:23.480 --> 00:30:25.580]   What is this stock price?
[00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:26.980]   Is this share price you're talking about here?
[00:30:26.980 --> 00:30:28.700]   That's share price in percentage, I believe.
[00:30:28.700 --> 00:30:35.100]   Oh, in percentage over the last two years and Google and Microsoft track pretty well together,
[00:30:35.100 --> 00:30:39.820]   actually, with Yahoo, you know, kind of a distant third.
[00:30:39.820 --> 00:30:42.980]   It's kind of an industry thing.
[00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:45.180]   You know, the industry goes up and down as a whole.
[00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:46.180]   Right.
[00:30:46.180 --> 00:30:49.180]   I don't see too many companies breaking out unless, you know, something weird happens.
[00:30:49.180 --> 00:30:52.660]   If with all the press that Google is breaking out, you'd think that that's, you know, I
[00:30:52.660 --> 00:30:56.020]   mean, this kind of puts it in perspective that Google is not the breakout that everybody
[00:30:56.020 --> 00:30:58.500]   says it is or is it?
[00:30:58.500 --> 00:31:03.400]   Well, if I was going to invest in one of the three companies, I'd probably put my bet on
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:04.400]   Google.
[00:31:04.400 --> 00:31:05.400]   I guess I would.
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:06.400]   Long term.
[00:31:06.400 --> 00:31:07.400]   Yeah, long term.
[00:31:07.400 --> 00:31:08.400]   Yeah.
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:12.780]   Because I don't see that, you know, although I think Microsoft has some potential, I think
[00:31:12.780 --> 00:31:13.780]   they really do.
[00:31:13.780 --> 00:31:18.020]   They have a death wish and I think, you know, they.
[00:31:18.020 --> 00:31:19.020]   I totally disagree.
[00:31:19.020 --> 00:31:20.020]   I totally disagree.
[00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:21.020]   I think Google is great.
[00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:22.020]   Well, all right.
[00:31:22.020 --> 00:31:29.020]   The fact is, I think that Microsoft is extremely well diversified right now and they are very
[00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:31.060]   well positioned, I believe.
[00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:35.120]   Although again, they're fighting for this advertising space, but aside from the advertising
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:36.900]   space, take that and throw it away.
[00:31:36.900 --> 00:31:42.500]   They have a whole war chest full of opportunities and income opportunities.
[00:31:42.500 --> 00:31:45.460]   And I don't really see that as much from the Google side.
[00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:48.700]   Now that doesn't mean they're not going to make their money, but I think Google is much
[00:31:48.700 --> 00:31:57.060]   more, much more potentially a risky play in a market that may be having a finicky advertising
[00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:02.460]   base because you have to think that if things really go to hell here, that the advertising
[00:32:02.460 --> 00:32:03.660]   may cut back a bit.
[00:32:03.660 --> 00:32:07.800]   Well, you know, I'm not going to take necessarily take your side, but I will mention the one
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:13.820]   thing which is on your side of that argument, which is that we witnessed this in the year
[00:32:13.820 --> 00:32:18.180]   2000 or so when the advertisers, all of a sudden jerked their money out of the internet.
[00:32:18.180 --> 00:32:21.540]   Like there was no tomorrow and all these companies that were startups that were going to rely
[00:32:21.540 --> 00:32:25.020]   on advertising and everything was going to be because of advertising.
[00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:26.020]   They all went under.
[00:32:26.020 --> 00:32:28.260]   In fact, they went under by the hundreds.
[00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:32.700]   And so the advertising people are pretty, you know, I've been listening to nothing.
[00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:36.380]   Most of the pod shows or podcasts that I've been listening to over the past.
[00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:38.180]   They're called Mevios now.
[00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:39.460]   Well, me and my podcast.
[00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:41.300]   All the Mevios I've been listening to now.
[00:32:41.300 --> 00:32:42.300]   All the Mevios.
[00:32:42.300 --> 00:32:45.980]   All the pod, all the net cat, whatever you want to call them.
[00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:46.980]   This is a real issue.
[00:32:46.980 --> 00:32:48.260]   By the way, what do you call these things?
[00:32:48.260 --> 00:32:50.260]   All these shows, all these internet-based shows.
[00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:53.260]   I've been listening mostly to stuff from Adtech.
[00:32:53.260 --> 00:33:00.260]   Adtech is a conference that's all over the world.
[00:33:00.260 --> 00:33:03.140]   They have a Melbourne, New York, and San Francisco.
[00:33:03.140 --> 00:33:06.700]   And they take all those presentations that they do, these, you know, where the speaker
[00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:11.460]   comes in and they have a group of advertising executives and talking about this and that.
[00:33:11.460 --> 00:33:13.940]   They record them all and they put them online.
[00:33:13.940 --> 00:33:15.220]   And so I've been listening to these things.
[00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:16.460]   And everyone's an hour long.
[00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:18.020]   It's actually quite interesting.
[00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:24.420]   You can just see that there are issues that need, you know, that have not been fully realized
[00:33:24.420 --> 00:33:26.660]   in the online ad space.
[00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:28.740]   And the online ad space.
[00:33:28.740 --> 00:33:33.340]   And I, you know, at Mevio, I listen to the stuff that goes on there.
[00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:37.260]   And I think that there's a, and I think, and I see what other people are doing, like
[00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:40.700]   at Rev 3 and elsewhere, and what you're doing.
[00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:45.260]   And I'm not convinced that they have the formula right yet.
[00:33:45.260 --> 00:33:46.260]   What would you do different?
[00:33:46.260 --> 00:33:47.260]   Because I'd love to do it.
[00:33:47.260 --> 00:33:49.300]   Well, it's not that anything I would do different.
[00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:51.940]   The problem is it's on the other side of the fence.
[00:33:51.940 --> 00:33:56.540]   It's the guys with all the money and all the, you control the purse strings, these big advertising
[00:33:56.540 --> 00:33:57.540]   agencies.
[00:33:57.540 --> 00:34:01.460]   They're not absolutely sure what they don't necessarily know what they're doing.
[00:34:01.460 --> 00:34:03.660]   And the few that do are pretty conservative.
[00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:04.740]   See, I'm small.
[00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:06.060]   I don't care what I do.
[00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:07.060]   No, you can fly in under the wire.
[00:34:07.060 --> 00:34:11.780]   But I fly in under the wire and all we do is we sell ads to anybody smart enough to say,
[00:34:11.780 --> 00:34:13.940]   "Oh, let's try this."
[00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:15.820]   And almost invariably they come back.
[00:34:15.820 --> 00:34:17.900]   If I look at the, Audible was here for one ad.
[00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:19.140]   They've been here a year now.
[00:34:19.140 --> 00:34:20.340]   Visa came for one month.
[00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:22.020]   They're coming back this next month.
[00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:24.500]   I mean, I can go on and on and on.
[00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:26.460]   I stock photo, go to meeting.
[00:34:26.460 --> 00:34:28.860]   All these people try and add or two and they come back.
[00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:29.860]   Yeah, but these are--
[00:34:29.860 --> 00:34:30.860]   And we're advertising agency--
[00:34:30.860 --> 00:34:31.860]   That's a matter.
[00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:32.860]   --we've been company.
[00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:34.340]   Well, no, these are all agency buys, by the way.
[00:34:34.340 --> 00:34:36.060]   We don't do direct retail sales.
[00:34:36.060 --> 00:34:37.060]   They're all agency buys.
[00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:39.060]   Well, what agency is doing this stuff then?
[00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:40.060]   Well, they're pretty--
[00:34:40.060 --> 00:34:41.060]   They're more--
[00:34:41.060 --> 00:34:45.780]   You know the problem is, John, it's the interactive division that is basically used
[00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:46.780]   to buying banner ads.
[00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:47.780]   Oh, it's terrible.
[00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:48.780]   They don't talk to--
[00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:50.340]   It's awful.
[00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:55.460]   They don't know what the hell a podcast or a Mevio or a netcast is, but they know banner
[00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:58.580]   ads and they think, "Well, it's kind of like a banner ad."
[00:34:58.580 --> 00:34:59.580]   And so they buy it.
[00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:02.660]   But the thing is when they get results, they stick around.
[00:35:02.660 --> 00:35:04.420]   So all I have to do is get results for people.
[00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:06.020]   We do do that, and that's all we have to do.
[00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:07.020]   But I am a small guy.
[00:35:07.020 --> 00:35:09.700]   I don't count compared to Mevio or Revision 3.
[00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:12.740]   They have a lot more shows and they need a lot more revenue.
[00:35:12.740 --> 00:35:13.740]   They've got investors.
[00:35:13.740 --> 00:35:15.420]   I don't have investors to prove anything to.
[00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:19.140]   So I got my wife who's pissed as it is.
[00:35:19.140 --> 00:35:24.460]   Elio, I put new chart in there for you just to kind of really stir the pot here a little
[00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:25.460]   bit.
[00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:27.220]   And I added Apple to it.
[00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:28.780]   Oh, wow.
[00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:30.140]   Where did you put that?
[00:35:30.140 --> 00:35:32.540]   It's in the same batch I gave you.
[00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:33.540]   Okay, good.
[00:35:33.540 --> 00:35:34.540]   Check it out.
[00:35:34.540 --> 00:35:38.820]   This is Microsoft, Google, Yahoo, and Apple.
[00:35:38.820 --> 00:35:41.860]   When you add Apple to the mix, "Holy cow!
[00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:45.380]   Boys and girls, tell us again just so we understand what this is.
[00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:48.740]   This is a percentage change in share price over the last two years."
[00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:51.500]   Not share price, it's percentage change.
[00:35:51.500 --> 00:35:56.100]   Yeah, so just to compare, you know, apples to apples, if you will, or apples to all everybody
[00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:57.100]   else.
[00:35:57.100 --> 00:36:03.500]   I'm showing that Apple is up in the same period of what, about 225% where Google Microsoft
[00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:07.740]   is often the 50, 40% Yahoo is in the negative range.
[00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:08.740]   Yep.
[00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:09.740]   Holy cow.
[00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:10.740]   Again, it's a different company.
[00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:11.740]   I mean, obviously it's a hard one.
[00:36:11.740 --> 00:36:12.740]   They're not an online company.
[00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:13.740]   Yeah.
[00:36:13.740 --> 00:36:14.740]   Put Dell in there.
[00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:17.460]   Of course, Dell will be down to down where Yahoo is right.
[00:36:17.460 --> 00:36:20.140]   Hey, you go, Dell, I'll put you all the way up for you.
[00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:22.900]   I got HP, I got it coming.
[00:36:22.900 --> 00:36:25.300]   While we're making graphs, we're going to pause for a moment.
[00:36:25.300 --> 00:36:28.180]   We're going to come back in a second to talk about the iPhone because frankly, that's
[00:36:28.180 --> 00:36:29.940]   a big story too.
[00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:32.980]   But first, I got to mention audible.com, our great sponsor.
[00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:35.660]   As I said, they started with us one show.
[00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:41.060]   They bought one show one year ago and it worked so well from them in the back and they've been
[00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:42.060]   with us for a year.
[00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:47.340]   It's one of the longest relationships in, in, uh, me, Vio history, net casting history,
[00:36:47.340 --> 00:36:50.340]   podcasting history, whatever you call these things.
[00:36:50.340 --> 00:36:51.340]   And we love them.
[00:36:51.340 --> 00:36:53.020]   And I think it's just a natural relationship.
[00:36:53.020 --> 00:36:54.020]   It's Father's Day.
[00:36:54.020 --> 00:36:55.620]   We're doing the show on Father's Day.
[00:36:55.620 --> 00:37:00.020]   And of course, as you know, one of the best journalists in the business passed away this
[00:37:00.020 --> 00:37:03.780]   week, a dad, a very proud dad, Tim Russert.
[00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:07.100]   And while I never met Tim, I have to say he was a role model.
[00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:12.300]   He wasn't, he was exactly the kind of guy you want covering these stories and he will
[00:37:12.300 --> 00:37:15.500]   be sorely missed in this election year and for years to come.
[00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:22.140]   But he wrote a book about his dad called big Russ and me, Father and Son Lessons of Life.
[00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:24.140]   It's narrated by Tim Russert.
[00:37:24.140 --> 00:37:29.580]   And I tell you what, if you pick one book from audible.com this year, this is the one
[00:37:29.580 --> 00:37:31.500]   you're going to want to listen to.
[00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:32.940]   Um, it can be your free book.
[00:37:32.940 --> 00:37:36.380]   If you go to audible.com/twit and sign up today.
[00:37:36.380 --> 00:37:40.700]   If you're not already a member, but even if you are a member, uh, it's, it's on my next
[00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:41.700]   read.
[00:37:41.700 --> 00:37:42.700]   Let me play a little bit of it.
[00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:47.900]   This is a Tim Russert, uh, reading from his book, Big Russ and me, Father and Son Lessons
[00:37:47.900 --> 00:37:53.020]   of Life.
[00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:54.020]   Any day.
[00:37:54.020 --> 00:37:56.380]   Here we go.
[00:37:56.380 --> 00:38:00.620]   About an hour later, dad came back, went to the bedroom, pulled out a sheet off his legal
[00:38:00.620 --> 00:38:03.940]   pad and brought it into the living room.
[00:38:03.940 --> 00:38:09.420]   Billy said, I want you to show me in black and white how you're going to support her.
[00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:12.060]   Keep it simple so I can understand it.
[00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:15.140]   Nothing complicated and nothing phony.
[00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:17.580]   Just give me the real numbers.
[00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:20.940]   Bill went to the kitchen table and dad went back to his chair.
[00:38:20.940 --> 00:38:23.820]   A few minutes later, they went over the numbers together.
[00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:27.700]   It must have liked what he saw because the next thing I knew, Ian Bill were driving over
[00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:31.860]   to Legion Hall to celebrate the engagement over a couple of cold ones.
[00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:34.420]   It's Big Russ and me, Father and Son Lessons of Life.
[00:38:34.420 --> 00:38:38.940]   Also at Tim Russert's other book, Wisdom of Our Fathers is also on audible.com.
[00:38:38.940 --> 00:38:39.940]   I'm not surprised.
[00:38:39.940 --> 00:38:41.860]   Audible is a great source for audio books.
[00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:46.940]   If you like to read, you like to use your time driving in the car or riding in a plane
[00:38:46.940 --> 00:38:50.540]   or working out of the gym or working in the garden, if you like to use that time and get
[00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:55.180]   something done, get something read, this is such a great service.
[00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:58.060]   A-U-D-I-B-L-E.com/twit.
[00:38:58.060 --> 00:39:02.060]   We thank them for their support and we really thank them for making it possible to your
[00:39:02.060 --> 00:39:03.980]   Tim Russert once again.
[00:39:03.980 --> 00:39:06.500]   Leo, can I make an audible request?
[00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:07.500]   Yes, sir.
[00:39:07.500 --> 00:39:12.540]   What I would really, I was thinking this day as I was sitting waiting to buy some books.
[00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:17.500]   What I would really like is a database of every audible pick that each Twitter host
[00:39:17.500 --> 00:39:19.180]   has done across all the shows.
[00:39:19.180 --> 00:39:20.180]   I got it for you.
[00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:21.180]   I never did this myself.
[00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:23.180]   I always wanted to do this.
[00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:27.460]   We had talked for a long time about audible making a Twitch page and they've never gotten
[00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:28.460]   around to it.
[00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:32.820]   I'm flying out there to meet with them and Newark and I'll continue to encourage that.
[00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:34.540]   But a guy has done that.
[00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:35.540]   It's called willhallmusic.com.
[00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:37.780]   Willhall, I tip my hat to you.
[00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:43.460]   If you go to willhallmusic.com on the right, you see Twitch TV audible book picks and it's
[00:39:43.460 --> 00:39:46.940]   for every show, every pick.
[00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:51.740]   I don't know what this guy does for a living or how he has the time to do this.
[00:39:51.740 --> 00:39:54.180]   But they're all there and I really appreciate it.
[00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:55.180]   Thank you, Willhall.
[00:39:55.180 --> 00:39:56.180]   Oh, that's brilliant.
[00:39:56.180 --> 00:39:59.300]   With illustrations and everything.
[00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:03.340]   What would be really cool would be to actually make, maybe this is something some enterprise
[00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:09.180]   encoder in the Twitter army can do, would be to make a social network based around this
[00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:10.180]   stuff.
[00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:12.220]   What are the Twitter hosts reading this week?
[00:40:12.220 --> 00:40:15.140]   What are the people listening to Twitter?
[00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:20.580]   If I want a recommendation, I can go, I can search by one of the audible tags like politics
[00:40:20.580 --> 00:40:23.140]   or technology or something.
[00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:25.540]   Because I also have something like that.
[00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:33.620]   Facebook could do it and there are a number of sites for, social sites for readers.
[00:40:33.620 --> 00:40:36.420]   I'm trying to remember the big one.
[00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:40.260]   It's a social network for readers in which we could easily set up a Twitch site on a
[00:40:40.260 --> 00:40:41.260]   Twitter.
[00:40:41.260 --> 00:40:42.980]   Yeah, that would be really cool, I think.
[00:40:42.980 --> 00:40:43.980]   Which one is it?
[00:40:43.980 --> 00:40:44.980]   Amazon.
[00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:47.180]   No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:48.180]   What's it called?
[00:40:48.180 --> 00:40:51.340]   It's like readers, bookshelf or something or let me know.
[00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:52.820]   There's a couple of them.
[00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:54.140]   Let me pull up this.
[00:40:54.140 --> 00:40:55.260]   I think this will happen.
[00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:56.660]   Goodreads.com.
[00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:58.340]   Thank you, Chatteram, always a Chatteram knows.
[00:40:58.340 --> 00:40:59.340]   Thank you.
[00:40:59.340 --> 00:41:01.100]   Red five, red leader, red leader five.
[00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:03.100]   You're the guy who got it first.
[00:41:03.100 --> 00:41:04.780]   It is goodreads.com.
[00:41:04.780 --> 00:41:09.020]   So what we could do is go to goodreads.com.
[00:41:09.020 --> 00:41:12.420]   By the way, we've now tweeted willhallmusic.com.
[00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:13.940]   You can't get there.
[00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:16.660]   Just please, guys, don't all go there at once.
[00:41:16.660 --> 00:41:19.460]   And as this one minute commercial gets to the 10th minute.
[00:41:19.460 --> 00:41:20.620]   It's not a commercial anymore.
[00:41:20.620 --> 00:41:23.100]   The commercial's over.
[00:41:23.100 --> 00:41:25.260]   It's just a conversation.
[00:41:25.260 --> 00:41:31.420]   I'm going to drop the big news that I don't think you necessarily want to talk about.
[00:41:31.420 --> 00:41:32.420]   Uh oh.
[00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:34.580]   Wow, what could that be?
[00:41:34.580 --> 00:41:36.820]   Kevin Rose is now number one on Twitter.
[00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:38.460]   Shut up.
[00:41:38.460 --> 00:41:41.140]   Yeah, he passed me this week.
[00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:43.340]   He's a few hundred ahead.
[00:41:43.340 --> 00:41:44.340]   No, I can say.
[00:41:44.340 --> 00:41:46.780]   Is he a thousand ahead?
[00:41:46.780 --> 00:41:52.100]   All I can say is Kevin has demonstrated that the dignity nation has more followers, more
[00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:55.100]   listeners and is more powerful than the Twitter army.
[00:41:55.100 --> 00:41:58.460]   I just on behalf of the Twitter army, I surrender my sword.
[00:41:58.460 --> 00:42:00.460]   Uh oh no, no, the game's not over.
[00:42:00.460 --> 00:42:06.620]   You said that Kevin has been pushing it to an extreme and now he's going to relax and
[00:42:06.620 --> 00:42:08.020]   now's the time you can overtake him.
[00:42:08.020 --> 00:42:12.820]   By the way, the war act, I need some help because I got bumped back by the, by the
[00:42:12.820 --> 00:42:16.700]   Mac news or something, something they decided to go pass me.
[00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:17.700]   No, Mac was a nine.
[00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:18.700]   I dropped the nine.
[00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:19.700]   There's a keynote.
[00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:21.900]   Mac rumors goes up because people follow them on Twitter.
[00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:24.980]   Yeah, now I got to go pass that number again, which is a good thousand ahead.
[00:42:24.980 --> 00:42:29.420]   John, is there a real business and a real purpose here or is it a science extension
[00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:30.420]   of an ego?
[00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:31.420]   It's exactly what it is.
[00:42:31.420 --> 00:42:35.020]   It's a science extension of an ego, but this beside the point, it's actually a fun game.
[00:42:35.020 --> 00:42:36.660]   I need more followers.
[00:42:36.660 --> 00:42:37.940]   The real, the war act.
[00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:38.940]   You know, the real, the war act.
[00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:40.380]   John, let me show you.
[00:42:40.380 --> 00:42:43.100]   This is the T-shirt, you know, because we had that race.
[00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:44.100]   You have like 50,000.
[00:42:44.100 --> 00:42:45.100]   I got like 20.
[00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:47.580]   I shouldn't at least be able to poach at least five from here.
[00:42:47.580 --> 00:42:51.140]   There was that race when I really got, we turned into a real weenie and started, you
[00:42:51.140 --> 00:42:54.740]   know, begging for people because, because it was good.
[00:42:54.740 --> 00:42:58.180]   There was a race on hub dub, which is kind of a cool site where you can make bets and
[00:42:58.180 --> 00:42:59.580]   create races.
[00:42:59.580 --> 00:43:03.260]   And, and it was who would be who would be number one on Twitter by May 25th and by the
[00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:04.740]   skin of my nose.
[00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:05.740]   I maintain it.
[00:43:05.740 --> 00:43:10.420]   I got this special hub dub, Twitter, Twitter, Twitter, May 2008.
[00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:11.700]   And on the back of it, I love it.
[00:43:11.700 --> 00:43:15.420]   It says, Hey, Kevin, how's the view from back there?
[00:43:15.420 --> 00:43:18.220]   But I have to say, I'm packing this up.
[00:43:18.220 --> 00:43:21.180]   I'm mailing it to Kevin because I'm the one behind.
[00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:22.380]   I'm one looking at his butt.
[00:43:22.380 --> 00:43:24.460]   Well, you can just turn the shirt around, Leo.
[00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:25.900]   It'd be the same thing.
[00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:30.780]   You can still make it, you know, a thousand followers is peanuts.
[00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:32.580]   You can, you can get that back.
[00:43:32.580 --> 00:43:34.020]   You know, there comes a time.
[00:43:34.020 --> 00:43:35.020]   I feel like Hillary Clinton.
[00:43:35.020 --> 00:43:40.580]   In fact, in my one thousandth tweet on Twitter, I said, this isn't the party we planned, but
[00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:42.860]   I sure do like the company.
[00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:48.140]   And then I offered Kevin the chance to make me his vice president, but he hasn't taken
[00:43:48.140 --> 00:43:49.140]   me up on it.
[00:43:49.140 --> 00:43:51.660]   He's got the committee is looking into it.
[00:43:51.660 --> 00:43:56.900]   He says, well, you're not, not to change the subject of this beautiful topic of.
[00:43:56.900 --> 00:43:57.900]   Oh, yeah.
[00:43:57.900 --> 00:43:59.420]   Where are you on Twitter, Andrew Horowitz?
[00:43:59.420 --> 00:44:01.220]   I'm about, I have like 12 people.
[00:44:01.220 --> 00:44:02.220]   What is your.
[00:44:02.220 --> 00:44:06.260]   And so this is why you're like on our case because you never got the traction because
[00:44:06.260 --> 00:44:08.340]   you know it fully understand the mechanism.
[00:44:08.340 --> 00:44:14.420]   Well, I guess the fact is that I just don't care.
[00:44:14.420 --> 00:44:17.700]   But how about another wonderful story for the weekend?
[00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:18.700]   Yes.
[00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:23.860]   And that is this really this altruistic effort by a variety of these companies to help with
[00:44:23.860 --> 00:44:25.820]   our horrible email addiction.
[00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:26.820]   Have you seen this?
[00:44:26.820 --> 00:44:28.860]   What's that?
[00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:35.980]   It seems that there was an article in the New York Times that talks about many of the many
[00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:41.180]   companies Microsoft Intel Google IBM found in an eight month period that some employees
[00:44:41.180 --> 00:44:47.740]   were encouraging, were doing so many digital and having so many digital interruptions that
[00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:50.900]   their productivity is down substantially.
[00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:52.700]   It's a big problem.
[00:44:52.700 --> 00:45:01.140]   So here's what's interesting, the Google, the Google introduced something, the email addict
[00:45:01.140 --> 00:45:06.460]   feature where it automatically cuts people off after 15 minutes from their email box.
[00:45:06.460 --> 00:45:07.660]   Oh, I love that.
[00:45:07.660 --> 00:45:08.660]   Okay.
[00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:11.380]   Maybe we should have the same thing for Twitter now that I think about it.
[00:45:11.380 --> 00:45:12.900]   We should definitely.
[00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:13.900]   Twitter's got that.
[00:45:13.900 --> 00:45:16.900]   It's called Twitter is down right now.
[00:45:16.900 --> 00:45:18.940]   Please come back later.
[00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:22.460]   But what's interesting about that is I started thinking now why would why would Google
[00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:23.460]   do that?
[00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:26.660]   I mean, this is one of those they really we should just say they released from Google
[00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:27.660]   Labs.
[00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:30.140]   They released about five or six new features that are really some of them very cool.
[00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:32.300]   And this is one of them is email addict.
[00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:34.700]   Well, if they're take care of what's interesting.
[00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:37.220]   If they're not on email, they're back on the web.
[00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:38.220]   Right.
[00:45:38.220 --> 00:45:40.940]   Because most of the time your email is not giving you ads.
[00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:45.780]   So they'll serve you up the ads back on the web as you'll get or you are such a cynic
[00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:46.780]   Andrew Horro.
[00:45:46.780 --> 00:45:50.860]   Well, I've been actually studying under the John de Vorak school of cynicism.
[00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:52.620]   That is very cynical.
[00:45:52.620 --> 00:45:56.380]   I don't think Google cares that they know they're going to get you anyway.
[00:45:56.380 --> 00:46:00.060]   They don't they don't need to force you off your email besides like this theory.
[00:46:00.060 --> 00:46:01.060]   Don't think we're not.
[00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:02.500]   I think he's absolutely correct.
[00:46:02.500 --> 00:46:03.500]   This is a scam.
[00:46:03.500 --> 00:46:04.500]   Oh, excellent.
[00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:05.500]   Oh, this was.
[00:46:05.500 --> 00:46:06.500]   Oh, good.
[00:46:06.500 --> 00:46:07.500]   So did I pass the final?
[00:46:07.500 --> 00:46:08.500]   Yes.
[00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:09.500]   So yeah, he did.
[00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:14.620]   And Leo who usually I play the Paul McCartney character in this band of Beatles.
[00:46:14.620 --> 00:46:16.380]   Oh, it's everything's good.
[00:46:16.380 --> 00:46:17.380]   Don't worry.
[00:46:17.380 --> 00:46:18.380]   It's going to be fun.
[00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:19.380]   But Google's not doing that.
[00:46:19.380 --> 00:46:20.380]   That good people.
[00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:25.460]   Actually, did you see Eric Schmidt saying, well, don't don't don't be evil.
[00:46:25.460 --> 00:46:29.180]   Isn't doesn't mean exactly don't be evil.
[00:46:29.180 --> 00:46:32.220]   That's the famous Google slogan.
[00:46:32.220 --> 00:46:33.220]   Don't be evil.
[00:46:33.220 --> 00:46:38.980]   And in a speech this week, Eric Schmidt said, we don't have an ethic meter, an ethical meter.
[00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:41.300]   It's just food for thought.
[00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:42.300]   Don't be evil.
[00:46:42.300 --> 00:46:44.220]   We don't really mean don't be evil.
[00:46:44.220 --> 00:46:47.060]   So what is he thinking when he even comes up with this stuff?
[00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:48.980]   He must have been smoking something.
[00:46:48.980 --> 00:46:52.700]   No, we don't we don't really mean don't be evil.
[00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:57.900]   We mean, just think about it before you're evil.
[00:46:57.900 --> 00:47:00.220]   Maybe, you know, you know, the other thing.
[00:47:00.220 --> 00:47:05.460]   Schmidt did this week, which was which was borderline dumb was the comment that he made
[00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:08.660]   that he was shocked, stunned and dismayed.
[00:47:08.660 --> 00:47:10.300]   It was flabbergasted.
[00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:16.380]   He was surprised and befuddled by the fact that the there would be deep packets sniffing
[00:47:16.380 --> 00:47:21.820]   and there'd be ISP level censorship as if he doesn't follow this at all.
[00:47:21.820 --> 00:47:23.340]   What is he doing with this time?
[00:47:23.340 --> 00:47:27.900]   He's like the inspector in Casablanca who says, Rick, I'm shocked to learn that gambling's
[00:47:27.900 --> 00:47:29.900]   been going on here.
[00:47:29.900 --> 00:47:33.220]   He's winning, winning's and sticks them in his pocket.
[00:47:33.220 --> 00:47:36.220]   I am shocked, shocked that there's packet inspection.
[00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:37.220]   Let's we're going to talk about the iPhone.
[00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:41.380]   I do really want to talk about Comcast finally saying and time Warner's doing this too.
[00:47:41.380 --> 00:47:42.380]   Yeah, you know what?
[00:47:42.380 --> 00:47:43.380]   And you wrote a good article.
[00:47:43.380 --> 00:47:44.580]   I think John on this.
[00:47:44.580 --> 00:47:45.860]   We're going to have to charge you.
[00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:47.940]   We're going to have to meter your bits.
[00:47:47.940 --> 00:47:49.420]   It's the only way to go forward.
[00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:51.420]   I completely disagree with you, John C. Dvorak.
[00:47:51.420 --> 00:47:52.420]   We'll talk about that in a second.
[00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:54.300]   But let's get to the iPhone real quickly.
[00:47:54.300 --> 00:47:57.260]   On Monday, Steve Jobs takes the stage and houses what we all knew would happen.
[00:47:57.260 --> 00:48:00.100]   A three G iPhone came out.
[00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:03.740]   It pretty much had all the features we expected GPS.
[00:48:03.740 --> 00:48:06.500]   What we didn't expect is a very low price.
[00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:07.500]   $200.
[00:48:07.500 --> 00:48:12.780]   That's because according to ours, Technica, AT&T's rewritten its deal with Apple no longer
[00:48:12.780 --> 00:48:15.380]   gives them any portion of the monthly fee.
[00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:19.980]   So it can subsidize the phone price down to 200 bucks for the 8 gigs, 300 bucks for the
[00:48:19.980 --> 00:48:21.380]   16 gigs.
[00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:25.500]   The GPS, you know, once you once you hear all the good things, you know, much, much better
[00:48:25.500 --> 00:48:30.300]   battery life, lower price GPS, 3G, then come the yes buts.
[00:48:30.300 --> 00:48:36.860]   For instance, yes, but 3G HSDPA is only available in a very limited area for AT&T.
[00:48:36.860 --> 00:48:37.860]   Many people won't be able to get it.
[00:48:37.860 --> 00:48:39.340]   I won't be able to get it up here.
[00:48:39.340 --> 00:48:44.060]   Yes, but 200 bucks, but you have to pay more money for the data plan.
[00:48:44.060 --> 00:48:50.580]   Now 30 bucks for the high speed and you get zero SMS messages, which is a major scam since
[00:48:50.580 --> 00:48:57.580]   SMS is just data now and they're charging you like 10 cents for 140 bytes of data.
[00:48:57.580 --> 00:48:59.580]   That's ridiculous.
[00:48:59.580 --> 00:49:04.460]   They also, you know, the GPS, Tom Tom and you know, jumped and said, great, there's GPS.
[00:49:04.460 --> 00:49:09.380]   We're going to write turn by turn direction program for the iPhone only to be held back
[00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:14.300]   by the sudden realization that Apple's new iPhone SDK agreement says you may not write
[00:49:14.300 --> 00:49:19.660]   under any circumstances, any turn by turn applications for the iPhone.
[00:49:19.660 --> 00:49:25.060]   So as usual, the reality distortion field set by Steve Jobs is kind of a little bit taken
[00:49:25.060 --> 00:49:30.420]   on by the actual facts, but it takes a day or two for the press to realize that.
[00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:31.940]   John, you're taking the 3G iPhone.
[00:49:31.940 --> 00:49:32.940]   Do you care?
[00:49:32.940 --> 00:49:36.860]   I thought your summary right there was better than half the reviews I've read of the iPhone,
[00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:40.580]   especially the ones in the press as you stated.
[00:49:40.580 --> 00:49:41.580]   That was good.
[00:49:41.580 --> 00:49:42.580]   It's a lot of yes butts.
[00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:44.780]   Yeah, no, I was outstanding.
[00:49:44.780 --> 00:49:46.980]   And I think you're dead on on every one of those points.
[00:49:46.980 --> 00:49:51.260]   And you know, I think the iPhone is becoming a big deal or a bigger deal than it was.
[00:49:51.260 --> 00:49:54.180]   And it's kind of, you know, eventually they're going to work it out so people are a little
[00:49:54.180 --> 00:50:00.380]   more cut loose a little more, but I think it is heading toward becoming a platform in
[00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:01.860]   it and of itself.
[00:50:01.860 --> 00:50:03.580]   Well, that's what's exciting about it.
[00:50:03.580 --> 00:50:07.220]   It may not be, you know, it's still not there, no cut and paste, you know, third party application
[00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:08.220]   is limited.
[00:50:08.220 --> 00:50:12.420]   Yeah, you can get super monkey ball, but you can't get GPS.
[00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:14.660]   But I think as you say, it's kind of a groundbreaker.
[00:50:14.660 --> 00:50:16.220]   It's what everybody's trying to copy.
[00:50:16.220 --> 00:50:21.700]   Samsung's new instinct, which looks to be the closest thing, now has visual voicemail,
[00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:23.980]   has actual turn by turn directions on it.
[00:50:23.980 --> 00:50:25.540]   That's coming out soon.
[00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:26.540]   I think you'll see other companies.
[00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:28.980]   And what they're doing is they're saying, well, people want this.
[00:50:28.980 --> 00:50:30.940]   We're going to make it somewhat like that.
[00:50:30.940 --> 00:50:33.260]   Will Harris, you're an iPhone junkie.
[00:50:33.260 --> 00:50:34.860]   Were you excited about the announcement?
[00:50:34.860 --> 00:50:41.860]   Yeah, I'm psyched for it because I guess over here we get a lot less screwed with the
[00:50:41.860 --> 00:50:44.140]   data plans and with the general plans.
[00:50:44.140 --> 00:50:46.500]   I mean, over here, O2 is the sole carrier.
[00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:53.100]   They're still doing all inclusive plans with the data, still getting, you get tons of SMS
[00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:58.780]   messages, you get a free upgrade from your current iPhone to the new 3G iPhone if you're
[00:50:58.780 --> 00:51:00.540]   prepared to extend your contract.
[00:51:00.540 --> 00:51:03.460]   Yeah, we get that to the software upgrade, basically.
[00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:05.020]   Or you get the new phone.
[00:51:05.020 --> 00:51:09.900]   And what they're letting you do is take your old iPhone and basically give it to someone
[00:51:09.900 --> 00:51:14.020]   else to activate it on the network for a pre-pay card or something for somebody else.
[00:51:14.020 --> 00:51:15.340]   So we don't even have pre-paid cards.
[00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:18.420]   They eliminated the Go option, Go phone option in the States.
[00:51:18.420 --> 00:51:22.700]   So you can now basically take that and give that to your misses or whatever.
[00:51:22.700 --> 00:51:25.660]   They're going to force activation to really good.
[00:51:25.660 --> 00:51:27.780]   And they're going to give you a free one.
[00:51:27.780 --> 00:51:31.900]   On certain price plans, now if you're a new customer and you sign up, they'll just give
[00:51:31.900 --> 00:51:32.900]   you the iPhone.
[00:51:32.900 --> 00:51:34.660]   You don't even have to pay anything for the iPhone.
[00:51:34.660 --> 00:51:35.660]   Wow.
[00:51:35.660 --> 00:51:37.420]   Which is really chunky.
[00:51:37.420 --> 00:51:39.140]   That's a big subsidy.
[00:51:39.140 --> 00:51:42.580]   But it's obviously because, I mean, previously Apple's business model was to make money off
[00:51:42.580 --> 00:51:45.340]   the ongoing subscriptions.
[00:51:45.340 --> 00:51:48.980]   Obviously they want to A net, what they want their model now is shifting to getting as
[00:51:48.980 --> 00:51:52.180]   many of these things as possible and making money off the app store.
[00:51:52.180 --> 00:51:54.460]   I think that's pretty clear what they're going to do now.
[00:51:54.460 --> 00:51:59.700]   If they're taking, what is it, like 25% of every transaction on the app store?
[00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:00.700]   I like mobile me.
[00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:01.700]   I like the idea.
[00:52:01.700 --> 00:52:05.300]   They call it exchange like features for home users, which is essentially the ability to
[00:52:05.300 --> 00:52:08.220]   sync your calendar and address book.
[00:52:08.220 --> 00:52:12.180]   You get 20 gigs of storage, but you have to pay 100 bucks a year for it, which is, you
[00:52:12.180 --> 00:52:14.500]   know, the Samsung will do that for free.
[00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:15.700]   Most phones will do that, syncing.
[00:52:15.700 --> 00:52:20.260]   Why my BlackBerry syncs with Google Calendar for free.
[00:52:20.260 --> 00:52:21.660]   So I'm not sure that's such a great feature.
[00:52:21.660 --> 00:52:24.340]   Andrew, are you a iPhone guy or are you a...
[00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:25.340]   I love my iPhone.
[00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:26.500]   I think it's great.
[00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:31.020]   As a matter of fact, I would go so far to say that, you know, with some limitations, like
[00:52:31.020 --> 00:52:35.100]   you said, the cut and paste and a few of the other things that are a little bit, you know,
[00:52:35.100 --> 00:52:39.900]   a little wonky, you know, you have the problem with some of the keyboard issues.
[00:52:39.900 --> 00:52:42.820]   But I would love just to have 3G on my current iPhone.
[00:52:42.820 --> 00:52:43.820]   Forget about all the rest of the things.
[00:52:43.820 --> 00:52:48.060]   I mean, you know, that would be great so that we don't have to go through this whole
[00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:51.140]   issue of, you know, signing up again.
[00:52:51.140 --> 00:52:55.220]   You know, the big issue in the beginning was nobody wanted to be with the AT&T to begin
[00:52:55.220 --> 00:52:56.540]   with.
[00:52:56.540 --> 00:53:01.220]   Not that there's anybody else really here that we want to be with, but the big talk in
[00:53:01.220 --> 00:53:02.660]   the investment community last week.
[00:53:02.660 --> 00:53:08.620]   I don't know if he knows the stock went down after that was not so much, you know, of
[00:53:08.620 --> 00:53:10.780]   course, some of the financials, but you know what it was?
[00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:11.780]   Steve Jobs' Health.
[00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:15.460]   Steve Jobs' Health is looking a little thin.
[00:53:15.460 --> 00:53:16.460]   Thanks to Matt.
[00:53:16.460 --> 00:53:18.020]   But drudge for that bogus story.
[00:53:18.020 --> 00:53:21.620]   Oh, you saw me looked a little bit thinner than I'm not saying that.
[00:53:21.620 --> 00:53:23.540]   He's a freaking vegan.
[00:53:23.540 --> 00:53:24.540]   Yeah.
[00:53:24.540 --> 00:53:28.220]   He looks like he's living on grass, wheatgrass or something.
[00:53:28.220 --> 00:53:30.060]   Well, I guess that's amazing.
[00:53:30.060 --> 00:53:35.020]   If you look at some as a really good story on a wall places value, like we had a pictorial
[00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:39.660]   of jobs over the last 10 years and it's, it's amazing to see him.
[00:53:39.660 --> 00:53:41.580]   You're in skinnier, isn't he?
[00:53:41.580 --> 00:53:42.580]   Yeah.
[00:53:42.580 --> 00:53:43.580]   Absolutely.
[00:53:43.580 --> 00:53:47.420]   The part of the reason that Wall Street is afraid is because of course he had cancer,
[00:53:47.420 --> 00:53:51.620]   pancreatic cancer and has been in remission for some time for that.
[00:53:51.620 --> 00:53:53.660]   Andrew, it's a publicly held company.
[00:53:53.660 --> 00:53:55.260]   Don't they have to disclose if he's sick?
[00:53:55.260 --> 00:53:57.140]   They said, oh, no, he's just got a bug.
[00:53:57.140 --> 00:53:58.140]   He's on antibiotics.
[00:53:58.140 --> 00:53:59.140]   He's already feeling better.
[00:53:59.140 --> 00:54:02.340]   I don't necessarily think personal health is a disclosure.
[00:54:02.340 --> 00:54:04.220]   As a matter of fact, not an disposable issue.
[00:54:04.220 --> 00:54:05.540]   It's not a material.
[00:54:05.540 --> 00:54:11.860]   We did a Teresa Piletti to the story and market watch on this with a lot of reporting.
[00:54:11.860 --> 00:54:13.380]   And no, you don't have to report that.
[00:54:13.380 --> 00:54:15.420]   You could be two minutes from dropping dead.
[00:54:15.420 --> 00:54:17.900]   It doesn't have to go, you know, it doesn't have to be reported.
[00:54:17.900 --> 00:54:20.140]   Well, this is a case where you should have to because nobody can run Apple.
[00:54:20.140 --> 00:54:22.540]   Well, you know, he, I, well, that is an issue.
[00:54:22.540 --> 00:54:23.540]   This is the problem.
[00:54:23.540 --> 00:54:24.540]   That's a problem.
[00:54:24.540 --> 00:54:27.260]   There's a couple of things I want to point out about this, the situation.
[00:54:27.260 --> 00:54:31.820]   I talked to John Markoff about it, who saw Steve and asked him specifically about this.
[00:54:31.820 --> 00:54:33.420]   I was feeling Steve says he's fine.
[00:54:33.420 --> 00:54:34.420]   I feel good.
[00:54:34.420 --> 00:54:35.700]   So what are you talking about?
[00:54:35.700 --> 00:54:38.580]   But there was this picture that ran that Reuters had.
[00:54:38.580 --> 00:54:39.580]   You were terrible.
[00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:40.580]   Yeah.
[00:54:40.580 --> 00:54:44.060]   Well, apparently, according to some posters there, there's two things I learned.
[00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:46.860]   It looks like that, that picture was doctored.
[00:54:46.860 --> 00:54:52.420]   Oh, they made him not that he's not gone, but he's not green.
[00:54:52.420 --> 00:54:53.420]   And, and Markoff.
[00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:54.420]   They made him green.
[00:54:54.420 --> 00:54:56.060]   You say they made him green?
[00:54:56.060 --> 00:55:00.580]   If you look at the Reuters picture that ran in market watch, which came from Reuters,
[00:55:00.580 --> 00:55:04.580]   it's a picture of the two of them side by side and on this newer picture, he's got a
[00:55:04.580 --> 00:55:08.300]   green gray tint to his complexion.
[00:55:08.300 --> 00:55:10.140]   If they Photoshop that sucker.
[00:55:10.140 --> 00:55:11.860]   And Granny Smith.
[00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:12.860]   Granny Smith.
[00:55:12.860 --> 00:55:13.860]   That's all.
[00:55:13.860 --> 00:55:18.500]   So anyway, so according to John, he looks, his power is fine.
[00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:20.100]   So there's that whatever that is.
[00:55:20.100 --> 00:55:23.860]   But the thing that somebody pointed out in the comments, and this is one of the really
[00:55:23.860 --> 00:55:30.900]   interesting things about comments and these blogs and publications, apparently he had
[00:55:30.900 --> 00:55:35.860]   what was called the Whipple procedure for his W.H.I.P.P.A.
[00:55:35.860 --> 00:55:38.620]   Did they squeeze his charm again?
[00:55:38.620 --> 00:55:44.780]   So they, which is a six hour operation where they essentially rewire your entire digestive
[00:55:44.780 --> 00:55:45.780]   system.
[00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:49.140]   And, and I had like bariatric surgery then.
[00:55:49.140 --> 00:55:54.740]   Yeah, it was a massive, massive, massive, and I mentioned this to Markoff and he says,
[00:55:54.740 --> 00:55:58.700]   well, that matches the fact that he knew it was a six hour operation.
[00:55:58.700 --> 00:56:06.260]   And one of the things that tends to show up is malabsorption, not necessarily as a return
[00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:11.300]   of cancer, but you just don't have your digestive system just doesn't do the job it
[00:56:11.300 --> 00:56:12.300]   once did.
[00:56:12.300 --> 00:56:14.740]   You can't, the wheat grass doesn't go down.
[00:56:14.740 --> 00:56:19.060]   And so basically you, so you just start, you know, you start losing a lot of weight and
[00:56:19.060 --> 00:56:20.780]   you get this gaunt look.
[00:56:20.780 --> 00:56:25.500]   Now, if he had like the flu or combined with the cold or something, I guess he'd look pretty
[00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:26.500]   crappy.
[00:56:26.500 --> 00:56:27.940]   I don't think he has cancer.
[00:56:27.940 --> 00:56:33.140]   I don't, I mean, from what I can surmise from all this, but I think he's like has a
[00:56:33.140 --> 00:56:39.260]   long term, he's going to have this issue and being a vegan vegetarian for the last
[00:56:39.260 --> 00:56:44.980]   X number of years, including leading up to the pancreatic cancer, which makes you wonder.
[00:56:44.980 --> 00:56:46.700]   I don't think helps.
[00:56:46.700 --> 00:56:48.180]   I just wish I were that thin.
[00:56:48.180 --> 00:56:49.180]   I don't.
[00:56:49.180 --> 00:56:53.940]   I think a lot of the problem people have with this is, is not so, you know, okay.
[00:56:53.940 --> 00:56:56.540]   So Steve Jobs is entitled to his private health, et cetera.
[00:56:56.540 --> 00:57:00.820]   But that if Steve Jobs was a drop dead tomorrow, what would happen to Apple?
[00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:03.740]   I mean, I thought it could be such a one man show.
[00:57:03.740 --> 00:57:05.780]   I mean, it is all about the jobs.
[00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:10.180]   So he's got, he really think that he really think, Thomas, a one man show is a total one
[00:57:10.180 --> 00:57:11.180]   man show.
[00:57:11.180 --> 00:57:14.140]   And he's got nobody groomed to take over that.
[00:57:14.140 --> 00:57:18.860]   That's on his level at the, you know, in terms of having a kind of a meta view of things.
[00:57:18.860 --> 00:57:23.780]   And it's, we've seen it before, if Apple loses Steve Jobs, you might as well just kiss
[00:57:23.780 --> 00:57:24.780]   the company goodbye.
[00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:26.740]   Well, the problem is he's weakened.
[00:57:26.740 --> 00:57:29.580]   Apple, he's basically turned it into a co dependent organization.
[00:57:29.580 --> 00:57:33.780]   He's by making himself the only guy who could make any decisions there.
[00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:35.660]   He's completely gutted it.
[00:57:35.660 --> 00:57:38.460]   And there's nobody there who could say that Phil Schiller is not going to step up, say,
[00:57:38.460 --> 00:57:42.300]   yeah, I could run this place like Steve, because he's been kept from making any decisions
[00:57:42.300 --> 00:57:43.300]   for so long.
[00:57:43.300 --> 00:57:44.300]   Is that the case?
[00:57:44.300 --> 00:57:45.300]   I think so.
[00:57:45.300 --> 00:57:46.820]   I think he looks good.
[00:57:46.820 --> 00:57:49.180]   I would love to be that then.
[00:57:49.180 --> 00:57:50.180]   What's that surgery?
[00:57:50.180 --> 00:57:52.100]   I don't think you want it.
[00:57:52.100 --> 00:57:53.100]   The miss the whipple.
[00:57:53.100 --> 00:57:54.100]   See, that's the whipple.
[00:57:54.100 --> 00:57:55.100]   That's the whipple.
[00:57:55.100 --> 00:57:56.500]   Please don't squeeze my prostate.
[00:57:56.500 --> 00:57:58.580]   I say that every time I go to the doctors.
[00:57:58.580 --> 00:58:02.180]   We don't need to know this sort of thing.
[00:58:02.180 --> 00:58:03.180]   Okay.
[00:58:03.180 --> 00:58:04.180]   Believe me.
[00:58:04.180 --> 00:58:06.340]   Really going down the hill here on this one.
[00:58:06.340 --> 00:58:11.620]   So anyway, I think Apple would have, I think it would be a slow slide, but it would be just
[00:58:11.620 --> 00:58:12.820]   like it was happening before.
[00:58:12.820 --> 00:58:18.500]   I mean, when they went through the series of CEOs, none of which had any pizzazz.
[00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:19.500]   They just-
[00:58:19.500 --> 00:58:20.500]   Interesting.
[00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:21.500]   It's just not a-
[00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:25.140]   So you think that's why the stock went down, Andrew Horowitz?
[00:58:25.140 --> 00:58:27.660]   Well, I mean, listen, there's always-
[00:58:27.660 --> 00:58:29.500]   It's just you sell on the rumor.
[00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:30.500]   I mean, you sell on the news.
[00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:31.500]   You buy on the rumors.
[00:58:31.500 --> 00:58:32.500]   I was special with Apple.
[00:58:32.500 --> 00:58:33.500]   Yeah, it was special with Apple.
[00:58:33.500 --> 00:58:34.500]   There was nothing.
[00:58:34.500 --> 00:58:38.700]   I don't think at the point that they got, I mean, I don't think I've ever seen any company
[00:58:38.700 --> 00:58:44.860]   have so many rumor sites and people that are dedicated to the rumors and the goings on
[00:58:44.860 --> 00:58:46.460]   with anybody but Apple.
[00:58:46.460 --> 00:58:49.420]   I mean, it's really quite a cottage industry to sell.
[00:58:49.420 --> 00:58:51.900]   But I think they pretty much hit it right on.
[00:58:51.900 --> 00:58:54.340]   I don't think there's any surprises here at all.
[00:58:54.340 --> 00:59:00.500]   That being the case, which most people are looking for a surprise and hoping for a surprise,
[00:59:00.500 --> 00:59:04.020]   it was a bit of a letdown.
[00:59:04.020 --> 00:59:05.980]   You know, I think they did what they had to do.
[00:59:05.980 --> 00:59:07.820]   They came out with a 3G phone.
[00:59:07.820 --> 00:59:10.140]   That's what AT&T had already said they were going to do that.
[00:59:10.140 --> 00:59:14.580]   You think they should have come out with a new air or update?
[00:59:14.580 --> 00:59:22.340]   Well, I think that maybe there could have been possibly something more in the iPhone.
[00:59:22.340 --> 00:59:24.860]   I don't think the iPhone had that much of a buzz around.
[00:59:24.860 --> 00:59:29.260]   I mean, there was some good things that they announced, but you know, the buzz really wasn't,
[00:59:29.260 --> 00:59:30.900]   I don't think they're after the announcement.
[00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:33.460]   It kind of just, you know, dropped right off.
[00:59:33.460 --> 00:59:35.620]   I mean, they talk about what about the, you know, I like mobile.
[00:59:35.620 --> 00:59:36.620]   I think mobile me.
[00:59:36.620 --> 00:59:38.460]   They finally do something good with the Daimak.
[00:59:38.460 --> 00:59:39.460]   But you know what?
[00:59:39.460 --> 00:59:42.300]   It's the Apple aficionados who really care about all this stuff.
[00:59:42.300 --> 00:59:44.580]   Most people are going, okay, it's a new phone.
[00:59:44.580 --> 00:59:45.580]   Move on.
[00:59:45.580 --> 00:59:46.580]   Not much different.
[00:59:46.580 --> 00:59:50.140]   Speaking of which, are we going to have our internet cut, by the way?
[00:59:50.140 --> 00:59:56.260]   I'm kind of curious what we think about, you know, these companies, you know, really charging
[00:59:56.260 --> 00:59:57.260]   us more or make.
[00:59:57.260 --> 00:59:58.260]   All right.
[00:59:58.260 --> 01:00:01.660]   Let's talk about it because John wrote a very interesting article.
[01:00:01.660 --> 01:00:03.620]   Was that in market watch that you wrote that?
[01:00:03.620 --> 01:00:04.940]   No, PC Magazine.
[01:00:04.940 --> 01:00:08.540]   PC Magazine, he wrote the article.
[01:00:08.540 --> 01:00:09.700]   I do that to you, John.
[01:00:09.700 --> 01:00:10.860]   I actually wait until you get up.
[01:00:10.860 --> 01:00:12.740]   What was the code word we're going to use?
[01:00:12.740 --> 01:00:14.660]   Yeah, that was when I was going to leave.
[01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:15.900]   But now I mean, I'm just up here.
[01:00:15.900 --> 01:00:17.940]   I'm trying to move some computers around.
[01:00:17.940 --> 01:00:21.220]   So I get away from the mic just when I do you say something.
[01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:22.820]   Of course I do.
[01:00:22.820 --> 01:00:24.340]   Saying my wife.
[01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:26.540]   Sense.
[01:00:26.540 --> 01:00:27.540]   Your wife?
[01:00:27.540 --> 01:00:29.100]   So, yeah, my wife does the same thing.
[01:00:29.100 --> 01:00:31.740]   I'll be doing a podcast and she always, she will.
[01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:32.740]   I won't hear it.
[01:00:32.740 --> 01:00:33.740]   The grilled cheese is ready.
[01:00:33.740 --> 01:00:34.740]   Come on.
[01:00:34.740 --> 01:00:35.740]   Right.
[01:00:35.740 --> 01:00:38.420]   So, so I guess what was I asking?
[01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:39.420]   Okay.
[01:00:39.420 --> 01:00:43.340]   So in the PC Magazine, you wrote an article, a call, which is a reprise of something I wrote
[01:00:43.340 --> 01:00:45.380]   six years ago.
[01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:46.380]   And you were wrong then?
[01:00:46.380 --> 01:00:47.900]   No, it wasn't wrong.
[01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:50.020]   How you be wrong when you recommend something?
[01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:51.020]   Oh, okay.
[01:00:51.020 --> 01:00:53.060]   You were, I thought you said it's like going to happen.
[01:00:53.060 --> 01:00:54.060]   Eight reasons.
[01:00:54.060 --> 01:00:57.460]   Eight reasons your web connection should be metered.
[01:00:57.460 --> 01:00:58.460]   Okay.
[01:00:58.460 --> 01:01:00.420]   Everybody in the chat room now altogether.
[01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:01.420]   Boo.
[01:01:01.420 --> 01:01:02.820]   Yes, John.
[01:01:02.820 --> 01:01:05.380]   Why should my okay?
[01:01:05.380 --> 01:01:07.420]   I'm going to let you state your case.
[01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:12.580]   Why Comcast and everybody else should meter what is now an unlimited bandwidth connection.
[01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:14.020]   And I'll tell you why you're wrong.
[01:01:14.020 --> 01:01:15.820]   Well, actually, I should go through the eight reasons.
[01:01:15.820 --> 01:01:16.820]   Not you mentioned it.
[01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:17.820]   Yes.
[01:01:17.820 --> 01:01:19.820]   Well, I have not to bring it.
[01:01:19.820 --> 01:01:20.820]   I have in front of me.
[01:01:20.820 --> 01:01:25.780]   I'll read it to you and you tell me number one, elimination of bandwidth caps restrictions
[01:01:25.780 --> 01:01:26.980]   and throttling.
[01:01:26.980 --> 01:01:31.180]   People make agreements with ISPs that state they have limits on usage and might be capped
[01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:32.180]   if they go over.
[01:01:32.180 --> 01:01:35.100]   This is a problem associated with any all you can eat scheme.
[01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:36.100]   It's dumb.
[01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:38.740]   Don't we don't want you saying we don't want bandwidth caps?
[01:01:38.740 --> 01:01:39.980]   I agree with you on that.
[01:01:39.980 --> 01:01:40.980]   All right.
[01:01:40.980 --> 01:01:41.980]   That's number one.
[01:01:41.980 --> 01:01:42.980]   Okay.
[01:01:42.980 --> 01:01:43.980]   Well, you agree.
[01:01:43.980 --> 01:01:45.460]   So there's no point of debate there.
[01:01:45.460 --> 01:01:49.100]   He says metering would allow people to use their local machines as web servers without
[01:01:49.100 --> 01:01:50.980]   worrying about some license violation.
[01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:52.500]   It happened to Dave Weiner.
[01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:55.220]   You know, these are maybe they're written or maybe they're written in such fine print
[01:01:55.220 --> 01:01:59.300]   nobody sees him or maybe the unwritten, but he got to 50 gigabytes in one month on
[01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:02.660]   his Comcast and they knocked him off.
[01:02:02.660 --> 01:02:03.660]   They didn't even gate him.
[01:02:03.660 --> 01:02:07.860]   They just knocked him off and he acquired and they said, well, yeah, you're a bandwidth
[01:02:07.860 --> 01:02:08.860]   hog.
[01:02:08.860 --> 01:02:09.860]   Right.
[01:02:09.860 --> 01:02:11.660]   You don't even tell you had it.
[01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:13.540]   Number two, promotion of higher speeds.
[01:02:13.540 --> 01:02:16.060]   One knows the faster your connection, the more pleasant the experience, the more pleasant
[01:02:16.060 --> 01:02:21.180]   the experience, the more someone was likely someone is to be online longer and use it.
[01:02:21.180 --> 01:02:27.940]   So because speeds are going up anyway, you say, meter it, then they'll make more money.
[01:02:27.940 --> 01:02:30.220]   They will make a little more money.
[01:02:30.220 --> 01:02:31.980]   Will all be at a hundred megabits in no time.
[01:02:31.980 --> 01:02:35.900]   I think we're getting a hundred megabits anyway because yeah, but you're still going
[01:02:35.900 --> 01:02:37.260]   to be capped.
[01:02:37.260 --> 01:02:39.380]   Go on to number three.
[01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:41.620]   Moderate users would pay less than they pay now.
[01:02:41.620 --> 01:02:46.340]   I always feel bad for the guy who goes online for 10 minutes, pays the same flat fee as
[01:02:46.340 --> 01:02:47.340]   dedicated users.
[01:02:47.340 --> 01:02:48.340]   That's a ripoff.
[01:02:48.340 --> 01:02:50.900]   He should be paying only for what he's using.
[01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:51.900]   I think you're right.
[01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:58.580]   If there were like a, you know, this many companies do offer kind of like a low use plan, right?
[01:02:58.580 --> 01:02:59.580]   A cheap low use.
[01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:00.580]   Do they?
[01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:01.580]   I don't know.
[01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:02.580]   I don't see it.
[01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:03.580]   It's like 45 bucks for Comcast.
[01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:04.580]   I don't know about cheap.
[01:03:04.580 --> 01:03:06.700]   Usually the tearing that's going on right now is not by amount of data.
[01:03:06.700 --> 01:03:08.580]   It's by speed.
[01:03:08.580 --> 01:03:12.820]   So you can get a cheap DSL plan, but you're, you know, you're limited in the amount of
[01:03:12.820 --> 01:03:15.340]   speed you have, you know, 768 kilobits or whatever.
[01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:17.140]   But I'll tell you, the guy goes on 10 minutes.
[01:03:17.140 --> 01:03:18.700]   Wouldn't know the difference.
[01:03:18.700 --> 01:03:19.700]   Right?
[01:03:19.700 --> 01:03:20.700]   Yeah, that's true.
[01:03:20.700 --> 01:03:22.500]   But if a guy going on 10 minutes, why is it?
[01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:23.500]   Did you have?
[01:03:23.500 --> 01:03:24.500]   Okay.
[01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:26.820]   So we have two guys that have the $40 slow speed connection.
[01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:29.380]   One guy's downloading movies and one guy goes on 10 minutes.
[01:03:29.380 --> 01:03:30.500]   Why is he paying so much?
[01:03:30.500 --> 01:03:31.940]   I'll tell you why.
[01:03:31.940 --> 01:03:36.460]   But first, number four, download junkies would pay for their habit.
[01:03:36.460 --> 01:03:40.260]   So what you're saying essentially is the hog should pay for all of their use.
[01:03:40.260 --> 01:03:43.340]   And the guys who are light users shouldn't have to pay as much.
[01:03:43.340 --> 01:03:49.500]   My belief is that if the internet was a meter, do you, I and the rest of us who use the thing
[01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:54.140]   a lot, but normally would still be paying about the same amount, maybe less.
[01:03:54.140 --> 01:03:58.900]   And these, then these guys who are just downloading day and night constantly and screwing up the
[01:03:58.900 --> 01:04:02.940]   little local loops and everything in between, they would be paying more.
[01:04:02.940 --> 01:04:05.540]   Spammers will pay more for junking up the web.
[01:04:05.540 --> 01:04:08.620]   The problem I have with this is I don't think spammers are paying now because they're using
[01:04:08.620 --> 01:04:10.100]   other people's connections.
[01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:11.100]   Right.
[01:04:11.100 --> 01:04:13.100]   Which brings me to the next point.
[01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:14.100]   Okay.
[01:04:14.100 --> 01:04:15.100]   That was clever.
[01:04:15.100 --> 01:04:16.420]   That was nicely done.
[01:04:16.420 --> 01:04:18.860]   So you can see the point five is completely BS.
[01:04:18.860 --> 01:04:24.140]   No, it's at least the point six elimination of the net neutrality issues of web.
[01:04:24.140 --> 01:04:25.140]   Oh, no, I'm sorry.
[01:04:25.140 --> 01:04:26.140]   Not Nick.
[01:04:26.140 --> 01:04:27.140]   I'm trying to.
[01:04:27.140 --> 01:04:28.140]   I was out of order.
[01:04:28.140 --> 01:04:29.300]   This is like down for like seven or eight.
[01:04:29.300 --> 01:04:33.140]   The fact is that the spammers won't be paying much, but I guarantee that the fact that they
[01:04:33.140 --> 01:04:37.380]   put people's, you know, put people at risk by putting trojans on their machines and the
[01:04:37.380 --> 01:04:39.180]   end like that was part of the whole thing.
[01:04:39.180 --> 01:04:40.180]   Yeah.
[01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:45.140]   Then some guys a dentist someplace or some housewife has got, she wakes up in the morning and
[01:04:45.140 --> 01:04:48.740]   she has spam the entire world unbeknownst to her.
[01:04:48.740 --> 01:04:51.540]   So she's going to be a bill and that'll stop her.
[01:04:51.540 --> 01:04:54.660]   That will make her think about what the heck's wrong with her.
[01:04:54.660 --> 01:04:55.820]   What's wrong with me?
[01:04:55.820 --> 01:04:57.820]   Why is my bills so big Comcast?
[01:04:57.820 --> 01:04:58.820]   We don't know.
[01:04:58.820 --> 01:05:00.860]   Just shut up and pay it.
[01:05:00.860 --> 01:05:03.660]   Number six elimination of the net neutrality issues.
[01:05:03.660 --> 01:05:08.100]   If web usage is metered, neither are nearly all the net neutrality issues go away.
[01:05:08.100 --> 01:05:10.420]   Number seven development of IPTV mechanisms.
[01:05:10.420 --> 01:05:14.060]   Once it's metered, then there's a business model for the growth of IPTV, which is of
[01:05:14.060 --> 01:05:16.500]   course going to require a lot of bandwidth.
[01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:21.740]   Jim Latterback's quoted in today's New York Times saying, Hey, my business revision three
[01:05:21.740 --> 01:05:25.540]   relies on this expanded bandwidth.
[01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:27.460]   Number eight energy savings, AKA green.
[01:05:27.460 --> 01:05:29.860]   If you're paying by the bit, you'll want to turn off your machine in the web connection
[01:05:29.860 --> 01:05:30.860]   at night, right?
[01:05:30.860 --> 01:05:31.860]   I'm sure I sure will.
[01:05:31.860 --> 01:05:32.860]   What?
[01:05:32.860 --> 01:05:35.220]   What are you thinking about your machine is in the middle of the night?
[01:05:35.220 --> 01:05:38.300]   I'm going to quite sneak some bits.
[01:05:38.300 --> 01:05:42.580]   Why did you shut your machine down to save bandwidth?
[01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:46.020]   Because somebody might be, you know, poaching your, your, your, your, your, your, your
[01:05:46.020 --> 01:05:47.020]   wrong connection.
[01:05:47.020 --> 01:05:48.260]   The whole thing is a Macguffin.
[01:05:48.260 --> 01:05:51.020]   It's all set up by the, by the big ISP's.
[01:05:51.020 --> 01:05:52.940]   They don't pay anything for bandwidth.
[01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:55.100]   bandwidth is essentially free right now.
[01:05:55.100 --> 01:05:56.100]   It's very cheap.
[01:05:56.100 --> 01:06:01.300]   At some point, every one of these guys still have to pay for, for a loop through May East
[01:06:01.300 --> 01:06:03.180]   and May West and that costs money.
[01:06:03.180 --> 01:06:05.340]   Not well, but most of their bandwidth.
[01:06:05.340 --> 01:06:07.260]   All the, all the peering relationships.
[01:06:07.260 --> 01:06:08.260]   They're not.
[01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:09.260]   Yeah.
[01:06:09.260 --> 01:06:10.260]   Yeah.
[01:06:10.260 --> 01:06:11.260]   That's true.
[01:06:11.260 --> 01:06:12.260]   They're not paying.
[01:06:12.260 --> 01:06:13.980]   But there's an overhead involved here with all those, all those servers and all the connections
[01:06:13.980 --> 01:06:14.980]   and all the wires.
[01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:16.660]   You don't think that, that counts for something?
[01:06:16.660 --> 01:06:17.660]   Yeah.
[01:06:17.660 --> 01:06:18.660]   And then they're getting more than enough already.
[01:06:18.660 --> 01:06:22.540]   That's like saying, well, why, why should we be paying for water?
[01:06:22.540 --> 01:06:23.540]   It rains every year.
[01:06:23.540 --> 01:06:24.540]   It comes in.
[01:06:24.540 --> 01:06:25.540]   Much more scarce research.
[01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:26.540]   It was resource.
[01:06:26.540 --> 01:06:27.540]   It comes in.
[01:06:27.540 --> 01:06:28.540]   No, it's not scarce around here.
[01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:29.540]   It's in the Bay area.
[01:06:29.540 --> 01:06:31.260]   And some other areas are not scarce at all.
[01:06:31.260 --> 01:06:34.660]   There's a lot of places where there's plenty of water, especially in the Northern States.
[01:06:34.660 --> 01:06:36.060]   And why are we paying it all then?
[01:06:36.060 --> 01:06:39.700]   Because it comes, it rains into the pool and it goes into a pipe and we get it.
[01:06:39.700 --> 01:06:40.700]   Why should we be paying?
[01:06:40.700 --> 01:06:43.260]   We should just have a flat fee of five bucks and that'll be the end of it.
[01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:44.260]   That's the same argument.
[01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:46.540]   My argument is you should pay what something's worth.
[01:06:46.540 --> 01:06:48.260]   I think that in fact, you're right.
[01:06:48.260 --> 01:06:50.700]   Water is worth a lot more than bits.
[01:06:50.700 --> 01:06:52.420]   Bits are virtually free.
[01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:56.760]   These guys are just using this just as they did net neutrality as a way to extort money
[01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:57.760]   out of people.
[01:06:57.760 --> 01:06:58.760]   It's pure and simple.
[01:06:58.760 --> 01:07:01.500]   It doesn't, there's all this dark fiber under the country.
[01:07:01.500 --> 01:07:04.100]   This stuff is cheap and getting cheaper.
[01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:06.180]   They're acting like it's getting to be more scarce.
[01:07:06.180 --> 01:07:08.060]   They're acting like it's oil, like it's water.
[01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:09.060]   It's not.
[01:07:09.060 --> 01:07:12.380]   I'm not taking the sight of the lies.
[01:07:12.380 --> 01:07:14.580]   I'm just saying it would make more sense.
[01:07:14.580 --> 01:07:15.580]   But it's based on lies.
[01:07:15.580 --> 01:07:17.420]   I would, no, it's not.
[01:07:17.420 --> 01:07:20.900]   I don't have one of my eight arguments.
[01:07:20.900 --> 01:07:22.700]   There's not one lie in there.
[01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:23.700]   I don't talk about the shortage.
[01:07:23.700 --> 01:07:26.980]   No, but it's ridiculous to say, oh well, what we should do is charge people through the
[01:07:26.980 --> 01:07:29.620]   nose and then that way spammers will have to shut down because-
[01:07:29.620 --> 01:07:31.820]   Where do I say charge through the nose?
[01:07:31.820 --> 01:07:33.620]   Well, because you're saying if you're me, you're selling that-
[01:07:33.620 --> 01:07:37.460]   I'm saying that it should cost you less than you're paying now and those guys who are
[01:07:37.460 --> 01:07:39.860]   hogging all the bandwidth should be paying more.
[01:07:39.860 --> 01:07:40.860]   They should be paying more than you're paying.
[01:07:40.860 --> 01:07:41.860]   I will, I will, I will.
[01:07:41.860 --> 01:07:42.860]   I will.
[01:07:42.860 --> 01:07:43.860]   You're paying.
[01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:46.100]   There's an essential element of fairness that people who are hogs should pay more than
[01:07:46.100 --> 01:07:48.300]   people who use a dribble at a time.
[01:07:48.300 --> 01:07:52.020]   And that's fine if you want to have tiered based on speed because the dribble at a time,
[01:07:52.020 --> 01:07:56.140]   people don't need the speed and I'll pay more for speed, which I'm doing right now.
[01:07:56.140 --> 01:08:00.940]   But I don't think it makes sense to charge people for the bite because the bite costs
[01:08:00.940 --> 01:08:01.940]   nothing.
[01:08:01.940 --> 01:08:07.340]   I don't like the idea of having this tiered speed either because it slows down the implementation
[01:08:07.340 --> 01:08:10.100]   of IPTV, which is crucial to the growth of this country's delicate-
[01:08:10.100 --> 01:08:11.100]   Well, you're playing with-
[01:08:11.100 --> 01:08:12.100]   Yeah, too.
[01:08:12.100 --> 01:08:15.620]   Yeah, but to meter it with two because nobody's going to download IPTV.
[01:08:15.620 --> 01:08:16.620]   Exactly.
[01:08:16.620 --> 01:08:18.220]   If it's going to cost them tons of money per-
[01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:21.860]   Why do you guys assume it's going to cost tons of money?
[01:08:21.860 --> 01:08:23.660]   Just because somebody says you're going to miss the internet.
[01:08:23.660 --> 01:08:24.660]   Because they weren't.
[01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:26.020]   This is all about making tons of money.
[01:08:26.020 --> 01:08:27.460]   I'll do something, John.
[01:08:27.460 --> 01:08:34.260]   If I watch more TV than you do and I have every single TV in my house going like 24/7,
[01:08:34.260 --> 01:08:35.620]   you should pay more.
[01:08:35.620 --> 01:08:36.620]   I should pay more.
[01:08:36.620 --> 01:08:37.620]   You should pay more.
[01:08:37.620 --> 01:08:38.620]   Oh, just because I had swimming more.
[01:08:38.620 --> 01:08:39.620]   Yeah, okay.
[01:08:39.620 --> 01:08:40.620]   Okay.
[01:08:40.620 --> 01:08:42.460]   I think we're talking about a few different things here.
[01:08:42.460 --> 01:08:49.180]   I think the main point is that the radio waves are not a resource.
[01:08:49.180 --> 01:08:53.620]   There's very little over-physical overhead to a radio wave.
[01:08:53.620 --> 01:08:56.780]   Water there's an overhead and so you meter it.
[01:08:56.780 --> 01:08:57.780]   Now the question is-
[01:08:57.780 --> 01:08:58.780]   The way to-
[01:08:58.780 --> 01:09:00.660]   What is the overhead for water?
[01:09:00.660 --> 01:09:02.220]   I've got the pipes in place.
[01:09:02.220 --> 01:09:03.820]   I've got a big reservoir.
[01:09:03.820 --> 01:09:05.380]   It rains into the reservoir.
[01:09:05.380 --> 01:09:07.900]   The water goes through the pipes into my house.
[01:09:07.900 --> 01:09:08.900]   What's the overhead?
[01:09:08.900 --> 01:09:09.900]   It's all fixed costs.
[01:09:09.900 --> 01:09:10.900]   It's capitalized.
[01:09:10.900 --> 01:09:15.580]   It's exactly the same cost as the ISPs.
[01:09:15.580 --> 01:09:16.580]   There's no difference.
[01:09:16.580 --> 01:09:20.620]   I could see and visualize that and isn't the internet pipes anywhere?
[01:09:20.620 --> 01:09:26.380]   The other thing with the internet is that the bits are free, the pipes are not.
[01:09:26.380 --> 01:09:31.980]   The question just becomes then how do you-
[01:09:31.980 --> 01:09:33.980]   That's why you tear your heart.
[01:09:33.980 --> 01:09:35.740]   You tear by right.
[01:09:35.740 --> 01:09:36.740]   You tear by right.
[01:09:36.740 --> 01:09:42.780]   That person who really wants to watch or do bit torrents or watch IPTV, let them pay
[01:09:42.780 --> 01:09:44.700]   for a better rate.
[01:09:44.700 --> 01:09:48.380]   You cannot cap it because I'll tell you what, these numbers are going to go up and up and
[01:09:48.380 --> 01:09:49.380]   up.
[01:09:49.380 --> 01:09:55.460]   There's Hulu, there's iTunes, there's revision three, there's Twitch.
[01:09:55.460 --> 01:09:59.180]   Everything is moving the direction of grotesque increases in consumption.
[01:09:59.180 --> 01:10:06.380]   I stand by my argument A and B, you guys are all living in the 70s.
[01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:10.660]   We're going to keep living in the 70s, damn it.
[01:10:10.660 --> 01:10:13.660]   It didn't work six years ago, John, I ain't going to work now.
[01:10:13.660 --> 01:10:19.560]   John, is this potentially because it's like telephones in your home are going to be eventually
[01:10:19.560 --> 01:10:24.220]   replaced, it seems, by some other device, particularly your cell phone, obviously.
[01:10:24.220 --> 01:10:27.340]   Who needs to be strapped down to a phone in the house if you can use cell phones?
[01:10:27.340 --> 01:10:34.900]   If Ymax comes and Ymax will be and could be ubiquitous, just there and it's like air.
[01:10:34.900 --> 01:10:37.580]   It's like, it's just there.
[01:10:37.580 --> 01:10:42.820]   Are these guys getting nervous about that somehow and trying to make a play to maybe
[01:10:42.820 --> 01:10:43.820]   bring in money now?
[01:10:43.820 --> 01:10:47.180]   I mean, is that any, any, any, any way related?
[01:10:47.180 --> 01:10:50.780]   The way Ymax is structured, there's no way they can roll that thing out and get any kind
[01:10:50.780 --> 01:10:52.980]   of penetration until about 2017 anyway.
[01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:53.980]   So that can't be.
[01:10:53.980 --> 01:10:54.980]   Yeah.
[01:10:54.980 --> 01:11:00.580]   At some point, Ymax also has to go back to a fixed pipe as well.
[01:11:00.580 --> 01:11:01.580]   So they're still going to make some money.
[01:11:01.580 --> 01:11:02.580]   Same issues there.
[01:11:02.580 --> 01:11:08.460]   We talk John to anybody in the big ISPs who say, John, we're losing our shirts.
[01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:10.300]   These guys aren't paying enough.
[01:11:10.300 --> 01:11:11.300]   We got them.
[01:11:11.300 --> 01:11:12.300]   We got to get more money.
[01:11:12.300 --> 01:11:16.100]   No, I don't hear that, but I do hear a lot of people complaining about the bandwidth
[01:11:16.100 --> 01:11:18.100]   hogs that I do hear.
[01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:19.100]   Yeah.
[01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:20.100]   I don't hear it.
[01:11:20.100 --> 01:11:22.940]   I think what's happening is they're too cheap to buy enough bandwidth.
[01:11:22.940 --> 01:11:26.300]   They're going to have to face this anyway, regardless bandwidth hogs are not, they're
[01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:29.700]   going to have to buy more bandwidth.
[01:11:29.700 --> 01:11:32.020]   They have to because we're all using more bandwidth.
[01:11:32.020 --> 01:11:35.860]   All of us, you know, I think that's already in the scheme of things.
[01:11:35.860 --> 01:11:37.020]   It's not the point.
[01:11:37.020 --> 01:11:39.900]   I think, you know, if we're just going to, I mean, I think it'd be great if we had just
[01:11:39.900 --> 01:11:44.420]   infinite bandwidth, you know, and an infinite cap that we didn't have to ever worry about.
[01:11:44.420 --> 01:11:47.420]   And we could just say everything was instantaneous, which would be very nice.
[01:11:47.420 --> 01:11:51.180]   And it didn't cost anything should be free if we're going to take that approach.
[01:11:51.180 --> 01:11:54.620]   Why don't we just make the whole thing free and make it, you let the government pay for
[01:11:54.620 --> 01:11:55.620]   it.
[01:11:55.620 --> 01:11:56.620]   That's crazy.
[01:11:56.620 --> 01:11:57.620]   They deserve a process.
[01:11:57.620 --> 01:12:02.220]   It's crazy than your perspective, because they're asking us to pay more for something
[01:12:02.220 --> 01:12:04.420]   that costs them nothing.
[01:12:04.420 --> 01:12:05.420]   It doesn't.
[01:12:05.420 --> 01:12:07.460]   There's no way it costs them nothing.
[01:12:07.460 --> 01:12:10.980]   There's a lot of capitalization and there's a lot of expense that goes into the maintenance
[01:12:10.980 --> 01:12:14.060]   itself on these on these wires, which fall off the poles.
[01:12:14.060 --> 01:12:15.060]   What?
[01:12:15.060 --> 01:12:16.620]   You don't think we're paying for that?
[01:12:16.620 --> 01:12:17.620]   Yeah.
[01:12:17.620 --> 01:12:20.700]   What does that have to do with how much are you saying it's got by download more?
[01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:22.620]   I'm wearing out the tubes?
[01:12:22.620 --> 01:12:24.140]   No, no, no, you're not.
[01:12:24.140 --> 01:12:28.180]   And if you're like, should I be paying the same, have the same water bill as standard
[01:12:28.180 --> 01:12:29.700]   oil?
[01:12:29.700 --> 01:12:36.420]   If the water's free and you're paying for the pipes, yes.
[01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:38.620]   It's not like the bits that are wearing out the pipe.
[01:12:38.620 --> 01:12:42.920]   As long as you've, as long as you, if you take the position that I and standard oil should
[01:12:42.920 --> 01:12:47.980]   pay the exact same amount for water, only if the water were free.
[01:12:47.980 --> 01:12:49.980]   That's my point is that they're acting as amiss.
[01:12:49.980 --> 01:12:51.220]   Well, no, I'm saying the word paying.
[01:12:51.220 --> 01:12:52.220]   That means it's not free.
[01:12:52.220 --> 01:12:53.220]   There's a paying.
[01:12:53.220 --> 01:12:54.940]   You're the other side.
[01:12:54.940 --> 01:12:57.580]   It's the other side that should be paying, not the consumer.
[01:12:57.580 --> 01:12:59.140]   Now you're talking about neutrality.
[01:12:59.140 --> 01:13:00.780]   Well, I mean, the fact is.
[01:13:00.780 --> 01:13:01.780]   That's what AT&T is.
[01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:04.460]   By the way, AT&T wants to wants to have it both ways.
[01:13:04.460 --> 01:13:07.940]   They want to charge Google more as well as us more.
[01:13:07.940 --> 01:13:09.700]   They're rubbing their hands and glee.
[01:13:09.700 --> 01:13:10.700]   They're saying, look at this.
[01:13:10.700 --> 01:13:11.700]   This is great.
[01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:12.700]   We're going to get Google.
[01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:13.700]   We're going to get everybody.
[01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:17.060]   We're going to make them pay more and we're going to give them these caps that seem ample.
[01:13:17.060 --> 01:13:21.180]   Now, right now, they say 95% of all consumers use less than 40 gigabytes.
[01:13:21.180 --> 01:13:22.180]   So what's the big deal?
[01:13:22.180 --> 01:13:23.940]   Nobody's going to want more than 40 gigabytes.
[01:13:23.940 --> 01:13:25.620]   We'll charge you a buck a gigabyte.
[01:13:25.620 --> 01:13:26.620]   Big deal.
[01:13:26.620 --> 01:13:28.060]   But they see coming.
[01:13:28.060 --> 01:13:34.420]   They know, they totally know that people will be eating gigabytes a day in five years.
[01:13:34.420 --> 01:13:37.140]   They're setting up to take us for a ride.
[01:13:37.140 --> 01:13:38.140]   That's exactly what I--
[01:13:38.140 --> 01:13:40.580]   That's bad for everybody.
[01:13:40.580 --> 01:13:44.780]   That's why I'm metering the internet and having a-- and I hate to say it, but having a public
[01:13:44.780 --> 01:13:49.660]   utilities commission-like environment where people can like protest this sorts of things
[01:13:49.660 --> 01:13:51.180]   instead of just stop us.
[01:13:51.180 --> 01:13:52.180]   It says right in there.
[01:13:52.180 --> 01:13:55.180]   I believe it has to be done by government edict.
[01:13:55.180 --> 01:14:01.660]   You know, if you're saying that we can somehow weigh in on the price we pay, that might change
[01:14:01.660 --> 01:14:02.660]   matters.
[01:14:02.660 --> 01:14:08.620]   But all I see here is AT&T saying, we're going to charge you 85 bucks for 40 gigabytes or
[01:14:08.620 --> 01:14:11.700]   more and a buck a gigabyte more and just leave it at that.
[01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:13.180]   And there's no-- what do you say?
[01:14:13.180 --> 01:14:15.140]   The FCC's going to say, no, you're charging too much.
[01:14:15.140 --> 01:14:21.140]   No, the FCC's-- the problem is right now we have a bunch of-- you know, numbers.
[01:14:21.140 --> 01:14:25.020]   Some nuts that are running all these government agencies that just let these corporations
[01:14:25.020 --> 01:14:27.740]   run roughshod over us and that's one of the things I'm against.
[01:14:27.740 --> 01:14:28.740]   This is how they're running roughshod.
[01:14:28.740 --> 01:14:30.260]   I think this is how they're doing it.
[01:14:30.260 --> 01:14:36.660]   They're saying we should charge more for bits because bits are just like water or oil.
[01:14:36.660 --> 01:14:39.180]   They're not infinite.
[01:14:39.180 --> 01:14:40.820]   They're a limited resource, but they're not.
[01:14:40.820 --> 01:14:42.780]   They're a bit-- an essentially free resource.
[01:14:42.780 --> 01:14:44.700]   I admit the physical plant costs money.
[01:14:44.700 --> 01:14:46.500]   We're paying for that now.
[01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:47.700]   Keep making that argument.
[01:14:47.700 --> 01:14:49.460]   I keep bringing water back into the picture.
[01:14:49.460 --> 01:14:51.100]   Because water's not free.
[01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:52.100]   Water is free.
[01:14:52.100 --> 01:14:53.100]   It rains.
[01:14:53.100 --> 01:14:54.100]   It rains water.
[01:14:54.100 --> 01:14:56.580]   And the water goes into a pool and then it goes into a pipe.
[01:14:56.580 --> 01:14:57.580]   It doesn't necessarily have free resources.
[01:14:57.580 --> 01:14:58.580]   Yes, right.
[01:14:58.580 --> 01:15:00.420]   Well, you have to process the bits too.
[01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:01.980]   You've got to put packet headers on it.
[01:15:01.980 --> 01:15:04.060]   You've got to do a lot of work on those bits.
[01:15:04.060 --> 01:15:08.580]   You have to process the crap out of them off of a server or off of a router.
[01:15:08.580 --> 01:15:09.820]   Water is a scarce resource.
[01:15:09.820 --> 01:15:10.820]   Bits are not.
[01:15:10.820 --> 01:15:11.820]   I'm sorry.
[01:15:11.820 --> 01:15:12.820]   I don't think it's a resource.
[01:15:12.820 --> 01:15:13.820]   They're not a scarce resource in all parts of the world.
[01:15:13.820 --> 01:15:16.100]   And it's not really a scarce resource around here either.
[01:15:16.100 --> 01:15:17.100]   Wow.
[01:15:17.100 --> 01:15:19.260]   It's a scarce resource in Saudi Arabia.
[01:15:19.260 --> 01:15:21.100]   It's priced like a scarce resource.
[01:15:21.100 --> 01:15:25.900]   Bits are not in any, by any sense, the imagination of scarce resources should not be priced as
[01:15:25.900 --> 01:15:31.620]   if somehow if you use 40 gigabytes, that cost 18 to more than if you use 10 gigabytes.
[01:15:31.620 --> 01:15:32.780]   Because it doesn't.
[01:15:32.780 --> 01:15:38.300]   And now I am, I admit, I'm speculating here because I haven't seen their spreadsheets.
[01:15:38.300 --> 01:15:42.300]   I would love them to come to us and say, look, let's show you how much it costs.
[01:15:42.300 --> 01:15:46.060]   But it's my contention from everything I know about peering arrangements and the way these
[01:15:46.060 --> 01:15:50.580]   guys do business and the amount of dark fiber under the ground that that bandwidth is not
[01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:53.220]   getting more expensive, it's getting less expensive.
[01:15:53.220 --> 01:15:54.460]   It's a lot less expensive.
[01:15:54.460 --> 01:15:59.660]   In some cases with peering arrangements, it's absolutely free.
[01:15:59.660 --> 01:16:02.500]   And that's all I'm saying is why are they saying it's getting more expensive?
[01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:03.740]   It's not a scarce resource.
[01:16:03.740 --> 01:16:05.100]   It's going the other direction.
[01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:07.220]   Prices should be going down, not up, John.
[01:16:07.220 --> 01:16:08.660]   Now they were smart enough, by the way.
[01:16:08.660 --> 01:16:09.660]   Where am I?
[01:16:09.660 --> 01:16:12.740]   Where am I advocating prices going up in this entire debate?
[01:16:12.740 --> 01:16:14.660]   Well, is that the impact?
[01:16:14.660 --> 01:16:16.500]   Is that the impact?
[01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:22.020]   You keep as you make this crazy logical illusion that somehow my argument is talking about
[01:16:22.020 --> 01:16:24.740]   jacking up prices when it's at the impact?
[01:16:24.740 --> 01:16:27.060]   No, the opposite is true.
[01:16:27.060 --> 01:16:28.060]   I lost desire.
[01:16:28.060 --> 01:16:34.540]   No, I'll tell you why it's going up because you're right that right now, 95% of the Americans,
[01:16:34.540 --> 01:16:40.220]   as AT&T says, or I think Comcast says, are using fewer than 40 gigabytes a month, that's
[01:16:40.220 --> 01:16:41.220]   the McGuffin.
[01:16:41.220 --> 01:16:44.620]   They're saying, well, right now, you know, only bandwidth hogs use more than 40 gigabytes.
[01:16:44.620 --> 01:16:48.520]   But all of the usage patterns are going in the opposite direction.
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:50.420]   We're going to all be using that much.
[01:16:50.420 --> 01:16:53.700]   We'll all be pairing that top tier in for a few years.
[01:16:53.700 --> 01:16:56.020]   This is a way for them to charge more money.
[01:16:56.020 --> 01:16:57.380]   No, it's not.
[01:16:57.380 --> 01:16:59.100]   It is if you let them.
[01:16:59.100 --> 01:17:01.340]   I can't stop them.
[01:17:01.340 --> 01:17:03.060]   Now I'm hoping that they'll be competition.
[01:17:03.060 --> 01:17:05.900]   So the problem is, and this is really the problem, Andrew, you might want to weigh on
[01:17:05.900 --> 01:17:06.900]   on this.
[01:17:06.900 --> 01:17:10.780]   It isn't really a perfect market because most areas don't have real competition.
[01:17:10.780 --> 01:17:15.540]   They have two or three providers who collude in effect or one or one.
[01:17:15.540 --> 01:17:19.140]   If this, I wouldn't worry about what you're saying at all if there were two competition,
[01:17:19.140 --> 01:17:22.340]   because some guy come along and say, well, frankly, those bits don't cost me anything.
[01:17:22.340 --> 01:17:23.420]   So I'm not going to do it.
[01:17:23.420 --> 01:17:25.260]   And guess who they would get all the business?
[01:17:25.260 --> 01:17:29.820]   I look at a country like Australia where they have outrageously low bandwidth caps,
[01:17:29.820 --> 01:17:30.820]   really low.
[01:17:30.820 --> 01:17:32.500]   And I think it holds a country like that back.
[01:17:32.500 --> 01:17:37.740]   Now the problem is that Telstra, which was a government run monopoly, still is government
[01:17:37.740 --> 01:17:40.420]   owned in part, I think 40%.
[01:17:40.420 --> 01:17:41.940]   Telstra has these bandwidth caps.
[01:17:41.940 --> 01:17:45.100]   Now the good news is in Australia, they're starting to get some smaller ISPs who are
[01:17:45.100 --> 01:17:46.540]   eliminating the bandwidth caps.
[01:17:46.540 --> 01:17:50.620]   I think for the economy, I think for the people of Australia, that's really important
[01:17:50.620 --> 01:17:51.700]   and I can tell you something.
[01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:53.340]   I have a dog in this hunt.
[01:17:53.340 --> 01:17:57.820]   I care too, because I'm putting out high bandwidth content and I want to see this be
[01:17:57.820 --> 01:17:58.820]   available to everybody.
[01:17:58.820 --> 01:18:02.260]   I don't want anybody to have these kinds of limitations.
[01:18:02.260 --> 01:18:03.260]   That's all.
[01:18:03.260 --> 01:18:08.860]   The other thing is if Comcast, which whose stock has been just blah at best for many, many
[01:18:08.860 --> 01:18:09.860]   years.
[01:18:09.860 --> 01:18:19.620]   Comcast was smart enough to do an Amazon style or the planet style server base where they
[01:18:19.620 --> 01:18:26.460]   could have utilized their incoming bandwidth and then had other people repackaging, if
[01:18:26.460 --> 01:18:28.420]   you will, to sell it.
[01:18:28.420 --> 01:18:31.860]   In other words, so people provision a server, they sell the server.
[01:18:31.860 --> 01:18:34.820]   They could have made a killing on this, but they didn't do so.
[01:18:34.820 --> 01:18:37.980]   Now they're looking to just scrape up any money they can from the wrong side, in my
[01:18:37.980 --> 01:18:38.980]   opinion.
[01:18:38.980 --> 01:18:42.420]   I'd like to point out that the reason John wrote this column is the same reason he wrote
[01:18:42.420 --> 01:18:45.780]   it six years ago because it stimulates this kind of conversation.
[01:18:45.780 --> 01:18:49.180]   I think it's a valuable conversation to have.
[01:18:49.180 --> 01:18:50.180]   Thank you, John.
[01:18:50.180 --> 01:18:51.180]   We appreciate it.
[01:18:51.180 --> 01:18:53.020]   I'm not insincere with these columns.
[01:18:53.020 --> 01:18:58.260]   Once in a while I do just a pure think piece that is about just designed to get people
[01:18:58.260 --> 01:19:04.180]   worked out or sometimes I'll do pieces that just to get my, so I can bring myself up
[01:19:04.180 --> 01:19:05.180]   to speed.
[01:19:05.180 --> 01:19:07.980]   I'll say something, you know, not necessarily stupid.
[01:19:07.980 --> 01:19:11.580]   But something that's a little naive, let's say, and I'll get a lot of feedback and I'll
[01:19:11.580 --> 01:19:13.220]   bring myself up to speed.
[01:19:13.220 --> 01:19:14.460]   That's not the case with this column.
[01:19:14.460 --> 01:19:17.060]   You really, you firmly believe this.
[01:19:17.060 --> 01:19:18.060]   Yeah.
[01:19:18.060 --> 01:19:19.780]   Well, all right.
[01:19:19.780 --> 01:19:20.980]   I just disagree with you.
[01:19:20.980 --> 01:19:24.420]   Oh, no, I can tell that, but I can see now that you just mentioned your own conflict
[01:19:24.420 --> 01:19:25.420]   of interest.
[01:19:25.420 --> 01:19:26.620]   I can see why.
[01:19:26.620 --> 01:19:29.140]   I do have a conflict of interest, but I think it's not merely my interest.
[01:19:29.140 --> 01:19:32.980]   I think it's the interest of not just content producers, but everybody.
[01:19:32.980 --> 01:19:34.860]   I'll tell you, it hurts people.
[01:19:34.860 --> 01:19:35.860]   I think more.
[01:19:35.860 --> 01:19:38.580]   I think I can participate in this new media revolution.
[01:19:38.580 --> 01:19:40.860]   And a more important thing right now is it is affected.
[01:19:40.860 --> 01:19:47.620]   They're trying to ramrod a bunch of tax bills through to charge people for buying online
[01:19:47.620 --> 01:19:48.620]   for every little.
[01:19:48.620 --> 01:19:49.620]   That too.
[01:19:49.620 --> 01:19:56.580]   Tom Dick and Harry, little city and municipality that has their own point five percent.
[01:19:56.580 --> 01:20:01.820]   You know, they want this all paid out to these guys because they can't get revenues
[01:20:01.820 --> 01:20:06.220]   any other way, even though they do everything in their power to set up speed traps into
[01:20:06.220 --> 01:20:10.580]   these places and and scam people in parking meters like in San Francisco.
[01:20:10.580 --> 01:20:14.700]   It's 50 bucks if you're on a meter and you, you know, the meter goes bad for two seconds.
[01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:16.460]   And a lot of money on that too.
[01:20:16.460 --> 01:20:17.460]   That's a real windfall.
[01:20:17.460 --> 01:20:20.380]   And it's all outsourced to screwy companies.
[01:20:20.380 --> 01:20:22.820]   So you can't even go to court to fight it.
[01:20:22.820 --> 01:20:28.740]   You know, this kind of thing seems more important to me than the denial of that of my absolutely
[01:20:28.740 --> 01:20:29.740]   perfect logic.
[01:20:29.740 --> 01:20:36.220]   I'll tell you why I think I am really defensive about the internet because I think the internet
[01:20:36.220 --> 01:20:40.660]   is a vehicle of absolute huge change societally.
[01:20:40.660 --> 01:20:43.700]   And I think that there should be really as few limits on it as possible.
[01:20:43.700 --> 01:20:47.700]   That's why net neutrality is so important because it's transformative.
[01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:52.540]   And I think it's more than just me making a little stupid little show that you can download.
[01:20:52.540 --> 01:20:55.740]   It's really transformative in our and you could you have to agree on that.
[01:20:55.740 --> 01:20:59.660]   And one of the reasons they want to tax Amazon is because if you're a mom and pop, brick
[01:20:59.660 --> 01:21:03.940]   and mortar store, you're losing business like crazy to these online guys, partly because
[01:21:03.940 --> 01:21:05.340]   there's no sales tax admitted.
[01:21:05.340 --> 01:21:06.340]   You you shop there.
[01:21:06.340 --> 01:21:07.540]   I'm not buying that at all.
[01:21:07.540 --> 01:21:08.740]   I don't think it's true.
[01:21:08.740 --> 01:21:11.340]   I don't see any of their sales tax.
[01:21:11.340 --> 01:21:12.780]   You shop there because you're lazy.
[01:21:12.780 --> 01:21:13.780]   Well, that too.
[01:21:13.780 --> 01:21:18.060]   The fact of the matter is is that there's little bookstores you go into and you speak
[01:21:18.060 --> 01:21:22.020]   and you don't you go into a bookstore, which is which has the ability to do merchandising
[01:21:22.020 --> 01:21:26.060]   that they can't do it Amazon because it's not you can't walk in and touch your product.
[01:21:26.060 --> 01:21:27.220]   I love going to a bookstore.
[01:21:27.220 --> 01:21:28.220]   You're right.
[01:21:28.220 --> 01:21:29.780]   So you see this cool book.
[01:21:29.780 --> 01:21:31.740]   Do you ever say, well, this is interesting.
[01:21:31.740 --> 01:21:34.020]   I bet you can get it for two bucks cheaper at Amazon.
[01:21:34.020 --> 01:21:35.020]   Maybe not a book.
[01:21:35.020 --> 01:21:39.420]   Maybe not a book, but I guarantee you it happens on electronics on cameras on big ticket.
[01:21:39.420 --> 01:21:43.220]   I don't think I don't think I don't think it's just sales tax though.
[01:21:43.220 --> 01:21:45.300]   I mean, I don't think the difference can be just that.
[01:21:45.300 --> 01:21:47.140]   I mean, over here, we have to pay sales tax.
[01:21:47.140 --> 01:21:48.380]   You have a huge sales tax.
[01:21:48.380 --> 01:21:49.380]   You have a VAT.
[01:21:49.380 --> 01:21:51.940]   But but but ours is is almost 18%.
[01:21:51.940 --> 01:21:53.940]   But you have to pay that on Amazon purchase as well.
[01:21:53.940 --> 01:21:55.460]   But Amazon is still cheaper.
[01:21:55.460 --> 01:21:56.460]   Yeah.
[01:21:56.460 --> 01:21:58.580]   But I don't think it's just that there's also the selection.
[01:21:58.580 --> 01:22:02.380]   These these a lot of these little stores and they they don't have any selection anymore.
[01:22:02.380 --> 01:22:03.780]   And it's not because of online.
[01:22:03.780 --> 01:22:05.860]   It's because they don't bother.
[01:22:05.860 --> 01:22:10.720]   But if you're going to I have a we had a sponsor was a camera store, small mom pop camera
[01:22:10.720 --> 01:22:14.180]   strip and around for 50 years really focused on service.
[01:22:14.180 --> 01:22:15.180]   Customers have come in.
[01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:20.380]   They'd say, well, you know, show me the different Canon cameras or Kodak and they do a little
[01:22:20.380 --> 01:22:22.140]   spend an hour with them.
[01:22:22.140 --> 01:22:23.140]   Customers say, thanks a lot.
[01:22:23.140 --> 01:22:25.460]   They go out and they buy it on Amazon because it's cheaper and there's no sales tax.
[01:22:26.460 --> 01:22:29.700]   And when you're buying a thousand dollar item, it's not only online.
[01:22:29.700 --> 01:22:32.380]   It's also look at what could happen to hardware stores in America.
[01:22:32.380 --> 01:22:35.620]   You remember you used to walk in and you know, you're friendly neighborhood hardware store.
[01:22:35.620 --> 01:22:37.100]   The pharmacies for that matter.
[01:22:37.100 --> 01:22:41.220]   I mean, what you know, these things have been consolidated because of the fact that it's
[01:22:41.220 --> 01:22:46.460]   just a much greater level of overall abilities to do pricing.
[01:22:46.460 --> 01:22:48.260]   Well, that's why Walmart succeeded.
[01:22:48.260 --> 01:22:49.620]   But why does online succeed?
[01:22:49.620 --> 01:22:50.620]   Is it the same reason?
[01:22:50.620 --> 01:22:55.420]   I don't is online killing what stores specifically is online killing Walmart.
[01:22:55.420 --> 01:22:59.020]   Would you want to be in the bookstore business right now?
[01:22:59.020 --> 01:23:03.260]   You've never wanted to be in the bookstore business.
[01:23:03.260 --> 01:23:05.820]   Would you want to be in the video store business right now?
[01:23:05.820 --> 01:23:08.340]   I mean, the bookstore business wasn't killed by Amazon.
[01:23:08.340 --> 01:23:10.260]   It was killed by these big chains.
[01:23:10.260 --> 01:23:11.260]   That's true.
[01:23:11.260 --> 01:23:12.780]   I mean, the same with the publishing business.
[01:23:12.780 --> 01:23:14.500]   You know, these people started consolidating.
[01:23:14.500 --> 01:23:17.580]   Once consolidation starts taking place, competition gets screwed over.
[01:23:17.580 --> 01:23:19.020]   It's got nothing to do with online.
[01:23:19.020 --> 01:23:21.660]   Just blaming online for everything is it.
[01:23:21.660 --> 01:23:23.420]   So you're saying it's not the sales tax.
[01:23:23.420 --> 01:23:24.420]   It's convenience.
[01:23:24.420 --> 01:23:25.420]   It's variety.
[01:23:25.420 --> 01:23:26.420]   It's a lot of other reads.
[01:23:26.420 --> 01:23:29.340]   Port merchandising the parts of a small mama pop store.
[01:23:29.340 --> 01:23:31.700]   So you think the sales tax, and I guess you're right, Will.
[01:23:31.700 --> 01:23:32.700]   If it does.
[01:23:32.700 --> 01:23:33.900]   Well, no, wait, let's back up.
[01:23:33.900 --> 01:23:35.700]   Everybody out there has bought online.
[01:23:35.700 --> 01:23:37.100]   It goes like this.
[01:23:37.100 --> 01:23:38.620]   Oh, this is interesting.
[01:23:38.620 --> 01:23:43.340]   Here's a photo filter I want to buy from these guys because I can't get it anyplace.
[01:23:43.340 --> 01:23:44.500]   There's no photo stores around.
[01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:45.500]   Carry it.
[01:23:45.500 --> 01:23:49.620]   And it's like $2, which is about half the price I'd be paying anyplace sales.
[01:23:49.620 --> 01:23:52.860]   And golly, I don't have to even pay sales tax on this $2.
[01:23:52.860 --> 01:23:55.140]   Okay, let me go order it.
[01:23:55.140 --> 01:23:57.900]   $2 plus $6 shipping and handling.
[01:23:57.900 --> 01:24:00.660]   I end up paying more online half the time.
[01:24:00.660 --> 01:24:03.900]   If I could get the product, I could walk into a store, if I could walk into a target and
[01:24:03.900 --> 01:24:08.100]   get it, I would get a better deal than having to pay these ridiculous shipping and handling
[01:24:08.100 --> 01:24:09.740]   price when they make all their money.
[01:24:09.740 --> 01:24:10.740]   You know what?
[01:24:10.740 --> 01:24:11.740]   They golly, because they do this.
[01:24:11.740 --> 01:24:16.980]   The guys that I feel sorry for really all the, you know, all those adult stores, man,
[01:24:16.980 --> 01:24:20.380]   who walks into a store and actually buys adult DVDs now.
[01:24:20.380 --> 01:24:22.180]   All about the online.
[01:24:22.180 --> 01:24:23.180]   I don't understand.
[01:24:23.180 --> 01:24:24.180]   I don't understand.
[01:24:24.180 --> 01:24:28.100]   You know, it's such a great experience going behind the beaded curtain in the back of the
[01:24:28.100 --> 01:24:29.100]   video store.
[01:24:29.100 --> 01:24:31.940]   You want to check out this buying shoes online.
[01:24:31.940 --> 01:24:32.940]   Have you done that?
[01:24:32.940 --> 01:24:33.940]   Zappos, baby.
[01:24:33.940 --> 01:24:35.220]   Or yeah, I shoe buy.
[01:24:35.220 --> 01:24:38.260]   I get like seven or eight different shoes and sizes and things.
[01:24:38.260 --> 01:24:39.500]   They ship them to you.
[01:24:39.500 --> 01:24:41.100]   There's no cost for the shipping.
[01:24:41.100 --> 01:24:44.340]   And then they give you the, you see, he's back to ship them all back when you're, uh,
[01:24:44.340 --> 01:24:45.860]   I'm going to give you an example.
[01:24:45.860 --> 01:24:47.100]   The catalogs probably have done that too.
[01:24:47.100 --> 01:24:49.900]   How could they even be making money?
[01:24:49.900 --> 01:24:50.900]   I don't know.
[01:24:50.900 --> 01:24:51.900]   I'll give you an example.
[01:24:51.900 --> 01:24:52.900]   So I need running shoes.
[01:24:52.900 --> 01:24:56.500]   So I go to our full service running shoe store where they watch your gate.
[01:24:56.500 --> 01:24:57.500]   They look at you.
[01:24:57.500 --> 01:24:58.500]   They do the whole thing.
[01:24:58.500 --> 01:24:59.500]   It took an hour.
[01:24:59.500 --> 01:25:00.500]   She chose the perfect shoes for me.
[01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:04.320]   I brought, I noted down the model number and when I need a replacement, did I go back
[01:25:04.320 --> 01:25:05.320]   to that store?
[01:25:05.320 --> 01:25:08.060]   No, I went to Zappos.
[01:25:08.060 --> 01:25:11.700]   I, I, I guiltily admit that.
[01:25:11.700 --> 01:25:12.700]   I'm, I'm the problem.
[01:25:12.700 --> 01:25:16.820]   No, this is going to, what is the difference between doing that and the following?
[01:25:16.820 --> 01:25:20.820]   You go to some high end Lexus dealer and you go there and you're
[01:25:20.820 --> 01:25:22.420]   just find a car you want.
[01:25:22.420 --> 01:25:23.420]   Our Lexus bond.
[01:25:23.420 --> 01:25:24.420]   I don't care what it is.
[01:25:24.420 --> 01:25:25.820]   And you find the car you want.
[01:25:25.820 --> 01:25:27.260]   And you say, this is pretty cool.
[01:25:27.260 --> 01:25:31.740]   And then you go over to your credit union, which has special deals for you employees
[01:25:31.740 --> 01:25:33.860]   that work for the city of such and such.
[01:25:33.860 --> 01:25:35.740]   And you order the car through them.
[01:25:35.740 --> 01:25:36.980]   What's it got to do with online?
[01:25:36.980 --> 01:25:40.820]   This kind of practice has been going on forever in one way, shape or form.
[01:25:40.820 --> 01:25:41.820]   You're right.
[01:25:41.820 --> 01:25:44.220]   Cause there's always going to be somebody who has lower overhead who's going to give you
[01:25:44.220 --> 01:25:45.220]   a deal.
[01:25:45.220 --> 01:25:48.140]   I, I, okay, I'm going to buy it now because it, and it's not the sales tax in that case
[01:25:48.140 --> 01:25:49.140]   either.
[01:25:49.140 --> 01:25:50.700]   It's just, you're getting a better deal.
[01:25:50.700 --> 01:25:56.060]   On the other hand, it does make sense that online should be collecting sales tax because
[01:25:56.060 --> 01:26:01.660]   in fact, you know, that law was obviously on the books for the inch, the, the, the statewide
[01:26:01.660 --> 01:26:03.580]   sales or out of state sales.
[01:26:03.580 --> 01:26:08.500]   And you know, you got to wonder when they're going to finally crack that.
[01:26:08.500 --> 01:26:10.220]   It's horrible to think about.
[01:26:10.220 --> 01:26:14.500]   I mean, there are, there's, if it was a one sales tax that you could collect, were, you
[01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:16.780]   know, country wide, it would be fine.
[01:26:16.780 --> 01:26:20.860]   It is like every city's now got their own little piece of the pie.
[01:26:20.860 --> 01:26:23.100]   And it's like a night or four computers.
[01:26:23.100 --> 01:26:25.300]   Yeah, but yeah, the computers can figure it.
[01:26:25.300 --> 01:26:26.300]   I agree with that.
[01:26:26.300 --> 01:26:30.380]   But then who's going to write all these checks and who's going to find the place to send
[01:26:30.380 --> 01:26:32.860]   the checks to and what happens when a check is late?
[01:26:32.860 --> 01:26:37.980]   It's like an overhead nightmare to send out, you know, the checks to 50 different states
[01:26:37.980 --> 01:26:40.900]   and probably another 150 cities.
[01:26:40.900 --> 01:26:45.180]   And God knows what else in between municipalities, counties, who knows what other kind of taxes
[01:26:45.180 --> 01:26:46.180]   are out there.
[01:26:46.180 --> 01:26:50.500]   You're saying thousands of checks out a year to these guys, which sometimes with 10 cents
[01:26:50.500 --> 01:26:51.500]   on it.
[01:26:51.500 --> 01:26:54.980]   I have to point out that there is a fundamental underlying consideration that you have to know
[01:26:54.980 --> 01:26:56.500]   about John C. de Vorek.
[01:26:56.500 --> 01:26:59.460]   He doesn't like taxes because he thinks it's giving money to morons.
[01:26:59.460 --> 01:27:04.180]   So I got to tell you, taxes are bad to you, John.
[01:27:04.180 --> 01:27:06.580]   I'm personally getting worried about Johnny's a little bit worked up.
[01:27:06.580 --> 01:27:08.340]   John, you get to take your blood pressure.
[01:27:08.340 --> 01:27:10.020]   I love checking it now.
[01:27:10.020 --> 01:27:11.020]   Checking it now.
[01:27:11.020 --> 01:27:12.220]   You know what we used to do?
[01:27:12.220 --> 01:27:15.500]   We used to do the radio show in the early nineties and I would, I would, we had, we
[01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:20.100]   were catered by Mel's diner and they would bring like pastrami.
[01:27:20.100 --> 01:27:22.100]   Oh, God, it was killing us.
[01:27:22.100 --> 01:27:23.100]   It was trying to kill us.
[01:27:23.100 --> 01:27:25.020]   It was really, we were trying to kill him.
[01:27:25.020 --> 01:27:26.860]   And then I get them all worked up.
[01:27:26.860 --> 01:27:29.980]   Get on the pastrami with a, with a Russian dressing and then get them all worked up.
[01:27:29.980 --> 01:27:31.540]   It was great.
[01:27:31.540 --> 01:27:33.860]   You see him turn bright red, but you were too young then, John.
[01:27:33.860 --> 01:27:35.500]   Now I could, I could really get you now.
[01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:38.460]   Yeah, I got too much polish in me.
[01:27:38.460 --> 01:27:39.460]   That's right.
[01:27:39.460 --> 01:27:41.220]   It's your natural, natural food.
[01:27:41.220 --> 01:27:42.780]   Hey, you know what?
[01:27:42.780 --> 01:27:43.780]   What?
[01:27:43.780 --> 01:27:48.500]   You actually told me on a, on a similar note and you trend amongst his male, uh, video
[01:27:48.500 --> 01:27:52.820]   gaming friends because obviously, you know, the more time he spent in front of a computer,
[01:27:52.820 --> 01:27:55.740]   the less thin and fit you get.
[01:27:55.740 --> 01:27:58.660]   And they've started this process of fat bombing each other.
[01:27:58.660 --> 01:28:02.180]   Well, instead of, instead of, instead of challenging each other to like go to the gym
[01:28:02.180 --> 01:28:06.420]   and get fit, what they do is when they go around to each other's house, they sneak like
[01:28:06.420 --> 01:28:11.660]   a massive box of chocolates or a massive like box of donuts and hide them under the sofa
[01:28:11.660 --> 01:28:15.580]   because they know that as soon as you sit down and play GTA four or something and you
[01:28:15.580 --> 01:28:19.060]   suddenly spot there's a massive box of donuts under the sofa, you're not going to move until
[01:28:19.060 --> 01:28:21.580]   you finish those donuts and that came in GTA four.
[01:28:21.580 --> 01:28:26.020]   And so they all progressively get fatter rather than trying to get each other thinner.
[01:28:26.020 --> 01:28:28.260]   I think that's brilliant.
[01:28:28.260 --> 01:28:29.260]   You would.
[01:28:29.260 --> 01:28:30.620]   It reminds me, John.
[01:28:30.620 --> 01:28:34.260]   It reminds me, actually, I have a box of chocolates here for you, John.
[01:28:34.260 --> 01:28:36.260]   I think you need a more an I do Leo.
[01:28:36.260 --> 01:28:37.260]   This is no, I already ate mine.
[01:28:37.260 --> 01:28:38.260]   They sent us two.
[01:28:38.260 --> 01:28:40.260]   This is a mono artisan chocolates.
[01:28:40.260 --> 01:28:43.380]   Oh, you know, as artists and chocolate sometimes can be quite good.
[01:28:43.380 --> 01:28:44.700]   John, this is like wine.
[01:28:44.700 --> 01:28:46.900]   This is like they've got a varietal on it.
[01:28:46.900 --> 01:28:47.900]   You know, where it came from.
[01:28:47.900 --> 01:28:49.900]   Oh, you know, I've seen this.
[01:28:49.900 --> 01:28:54.660]   Yeah, that's like actually isn't one of our isn't one of the guys we know some high
[01:28:54.660 --> 01:28:55.660]   tech.
[01:28:55.660 --> 01:28:56.660]   You know, what's that?
[01:28:56.660 --> 01:28:57.660]   Oh, is doing that.
[01:28:57.660 --> 01:28:58.660]   All right.
[01:28:58.660 --> 01:28:59.740]   Resettio's doing varietal chocolate.
[01:28:59.740 --> 01:29:06.260]   It's very good TCHO and I was talking about it because Amy, Amy, uh, Crittenden sent me
[01:29:06.260 --> 01:29:09.860]   a box of it because she's doing the PR for it and I loved it and I ate it on to it live.
[01:29:09.860 --> 01:29:15.220]   And so our mono who is also a tech guy, the guy who started this said, well, you know,
[01:29:15.220 --> 01:29:20.780]   show is fine, but there's another being to bar roaster that is very good.
[01:29:20.780 --> 01:29:22.540]   It's my company, a mono.
[01:29:22.540 --> 01:29:23.540]   They make him in Colorado.
[01:29:23.540 --> 01:29:26.540]   He listens to twit while he makes the chocolate and you know, I give him his incentive to
[01:29:26.540 --> 01:29:27.540]   me.
[01:29:27.540 --> 01:29:28.540]   I have, I have this box.
[01:29:28.540 --> 01:29:30.300]   I have shown such restraints.
[01:29:30.300 --> 01:29:33.540]   You could put it right next to that microphone.
[01:29:33.540 --> 01:29:34.540]   All right.
[01:29:34.540 --> 01:29:40.620]   All right, just so you know, it's going on on camera right now.
[01:29:40.620 --> 01:29:41.900]   Microphone chocolates right there.
[01:29:41.900 --> 01:29:45.180]   That's for John C put in a box there with a lock on it.
[01:29:45.180 --> 01:29:46.340]   You come by, I won't eat this.
[01:29:46.340 --> 01:29:47.540]   I've been so good, John.
[01:29:47.540 --> 01:29:48.540]   I've known this.
[01:29:48.540 --> 01:29:49.540]   These are $7 a bar.
[01:29:49.540 --> 01:29:51.060]   They're like 20 bars in here.
[01:29:51.060 --> 01:29:52.060]   I've been so good.
[01:29:52.060 --> 01:29:53.060]   Have you had any?
[01:29:53.060 --> 01:29:56.340]   No, I had my own box and I ate them all, but, but that, but I haven't touched yours and
[01:29:56.340 --> 01:29:57.740]   I've known it's been in here.
[01:29:57.740 --> 01:30:01.820]   Well, I would admire that because if it was that great, I probably would have, I actually,
[01:30:01.820 --> 01:30:05.180]   you know, I, I tried trying to minimize eating candy.
[01:30:05.180 --> 01:30:06.540]   I know I didn't want to fat bomb you.
[01:30:06.540 --> 01:30:08.380]   So I'm just saving it until you.
[01:30:08.380 --> 01:30:09.380]   I know I should.
[01:30:09.380 --> 01:30:10.380]   We should neither of us should be eating that.
[01:30:10.380 --> 01:30:11.820]   You're in much better shape than I am.
[01:30:11.820 --> 01:30:16.980]   I feel like somebody like Tim Russer and you know that 50 year old guys in our 50s with
[01:30:16.980 --> 01:30:22.020]   a little extra weight, all of us gasped a little bit to think.
[01:30:22.020 --> 01:30:26.820]   No, every time some, but why, you know, every time somebody dies in their third, especially
[01:30:26.820 --> 01:30:30.220]   if they die in their 30s or 40s and well, then you think there's something else involved.
[01:30:30.220 --> 01:30:31.220]   Right.
[01:30:31.220 --> 01:30:37.060]   Well, late 50s heart disease, asymptomatic, you go, Oh, oh, and I just kind of patted
[01:30:37.060 --> 01:30:39.780]   my heart and said, I hope you're okay in there.
[01:30:39.780 --> 01:30:42.340]   Just be good, be good for a few more years.
[01:30:42.340 --> 01:30:43.340]   I just love you.
[01:30:43.340 --> 01:30:45.060]   Just kind of get a probably Tim Russer.
[01:30:45.060 --> 01:30:46.220]   I now thank him.
[01:30:46.220 --> 01:30:52.300]   I kind of in wherever he is for saving my chocolate because apparently I think that's what did
[01:30:52.300 --> 01:30:53.300]   exactly what happened.
[01:30:53.300 --> 01:30:54.900]   I wouldn't need it because of Tim.
[01:30:54.900 --> 01:30:55.900]   Hey, we got it.
[01:30:55.900 --> 01:30:56.900]   We're going to run.
[01:30:56.900 --> 01:30:59.820]   This has been a great show and I want to do another hour with you and I probably could,
[01:30:59.820 --> 01:31:01.100]   but we really should run.
[01:31:01.100 --> 01:31:02.100]   You didn't get to all the stories.
[01:31:02.100 --> 01:31:08.060]   I do want to mention that Firefox three comes out on Tuesday the 17th.
[01:31:08.060 --> 01:31:12.460]   They are trying to set a Guinness workbook of world records for the most South software
[01:31:12.460 --> 01:31:14.780]   downloaded in 24 hours.
[01:31:14.780 --> 01:31:20.940]   You could participate by going to spread firefox.com and making a pledge that you will download
[01:31:20.940 --> 01:31:21.940]   on.
[01:31:21.940 --> 01:31:26.820]   I don't know why I've never heard of a company saying everybody download this program now.
[01:31:26.820 --> 01:31:28.660]   Talk about crazy and with problems.
[01:31:28.660 --> 01:31:30.940]   Yeah, they should be paying.
[01:31:30.940 --> 01:31:33.420]   No, it underscores my point, John, that bandwidth is free.
[01:31:33.420 --> 01:31:34.420]   Well, here we go.
[01:31:34.420 --> 01:31:35.420]   Here we go.
[01:31:35.420 --> 01:31:38.060]   Wait till they get their money.
[01:31:38.060 --> 01:31:39.660]   Yeah, it's freely like that bill.
[01:31:39.660 --> 01:31:40.820]   You got that one time.
[01:31:40.820 --> 01:31:46.460]   That wasn't free, but he was able to waive that bill without bankrupting himself because
[01:31:46.460 --> 01:31:49.820]   it really didn't have any real cost.
[01:31:49.820 --> 01:31:53.940]   1.2, actually almost 1.3 million pledges so far.
[01:31:53.940 --> 01:31:54.940]   Let's help them with that record.
[01:31:54.940 --> 01:31:59.140]   We could add a few hundred thousand from the Twitter army if you just go there, spreadfirefox.com
[01:31:59.140 --> 01:32:01.380]   and you know I've been using firefox 3 in every beta.
[01:32:01.380 --> 01:32:05.620]   It's now released Canada 3 and I think it's really, it's the best firefox ever.
[01:32:05.620 --> 01:32:07.460]   And I hated firefox 2, by the way.
[01:32:07.460 --> 01:32:08.460]   I did too.
[01:32:08.460 --> 01:32:12.740]   I think you should send the Twitter army to sign up for the real Devorak on Twitter.
[01:32:12.740 --> 01:32:13.740]   Please do.
[01:32:13.740 --> 01:32:14.740]   Make John, you know what?
[01:32:14.740 --> 01:32:15.740]   I don't care.
[01:32:15.740 --> 01:32:16.740]   I've given up.
[01:32:16.740 --> 01:32:17.740]   I know Kevin Rose is a better man.
[01:32:17.740 --> 01:32:19.980]   I know the dignity nation is better than the Twitter army.
[01:32:19.980 --> 01:32:20.980]   That's okay.
[01:32:20.980 --> 01:32:24.980]   I can live with that, but I can't live with my poor friend, John C. Devorak.
[01:32:24.980 --> 01:32:25.980]   Below Mac rumors?
[01:32:25.980 --> 01:32:27.780]   That can't be right.
[01:32:27.780 --> 01:32:31.820]   Now I was just below Victoria.
[01:32:31.820 --> 01:32:32.820]   I say it again.
[01:32:32.820 --> 01:32:35.260]   Veronica Belma, I was under Veronica as someone.
[01:32:35.260 --> 01:32:37.140]   That's not about place to be, John.
[01:32:37.140 --> 01:32:41.260]   And so I'm thinking I wanted to be under Veronica for a while and then maybe I could
[01:32:41.260 --> 01:32:43.540]   pass her up and be on top of her as it were.
[01:32:43.540 --> 01:32:44.540]   Excellent.
[01:32:44.540 --> 01:32:45.540]   Excellent.
[01:32:45.540 --> 01:32:47.500]   Now I'm going to actually come onto Twitter now.
[01:32:47.500 --> 01:32:48.980]   What's your, you're not on Twitter yet?
[01:32:48.980 --> 01:32:49.980]   Oh, I am.
[01:32:49.980 --> 01:32:50.980]   Don't, don't, please.
[01:32:50.980 --> 01:32:51.980]   Tell them to go.
[01:32:51.980 --> 01:32:54.300]   By the way, why do we keep calling your Victoria button?
[01:32:54.300 --> 01:32:57.900]   Because of Victoria's secret, I think of her sometimes in my dreams.
[01:32:57.900 --> 01:32:58.900]   Oh, okay.
[01:32:58.900 --> 01:32:59.900]   In lingerie.
[01:32:59.900 --> 01:33:00.900]   No, I don't know.
[01:33:00.900 --> 01:33:07.180]   I, the Kindle I took your advice real quick and use my hands in a different, I'm loving
[01:33:07.180 --> 01:33:08.180]   that Kindle.
[01:33:08.180 --> 01:33:09.580]   You hold it by the keyboard, right?
[01:33:09.580 --> 01:33:10.580]   The keyboard.
[01:33:10.580 --> 01:33:11.580]   Yep.
[01:33:11.580 --> 01:33:12.580]   And I can't wait.
[01:33:12.580 --> 01:33:14.820]   I'm going to try to, hopefully my book's going to be Kindle next week, but we should
[01:33:14.820 --> 01:33:16.340]   mention audible.com.
[01:33:16.340 --> 01:33:19.940]   You were going to be the pick this weekend, Andrew, and I apologize, but the discipline
[01:33:19.940 --> 01:33:23.540]   investor is available on audible.com as an audiobook.
[01:33:23.540 --> 01:33:26.860]   Great book, by the way, for people who don't know anything about investing and need to
[01:33:26.860 --> 01:33:27.860]   know like you.
[01:33:27.860 --> 01:33:30.420]   No, I know it was a little bit.
[01:33:30.420 --> 01:33:31.420]   I read the book.
[01:33:31.420 --> 01:33:33.060]   I read his book and now I know what I'm doing.
[01:33:33.060 --> 01:33:34.060]   Oh, he knows.
[01:33:34.060 --> 01:33:35.220]   He's a discipline investor.
[01:33:35.220 --> 01:33:36.300]   I have a discipline investor.
[01:33:36.300 --> 01:33:37.300]   I don't invest.
[01:33:37.300 --> 01:33:39.420]   See, that's my discipline.
[01:33:39.420 --> 01:33:40.420]   Best approach.
[01:33:40.420 --> 01:33:41.860]   Twitter, he probably is right now.
[01:33:41.860 --> 01:33:44.820]   Twitter.com/therealdevorect.
[01:33:44.820 --> 01:33:48.820]   Twitter.com/wheelharris with one L right will.
[01:33:48.820 --> 01:33:49.820]   Absolutely.
[01:33:49.820 --> 01:33:51.500]   If he hasn't fallen asleep yet.
[01:33:51.500 --> 01:33:53.500]   And Andrew, come on.
[01:33:53.500 --> 01:33:55.380]   Twitter.com/it's very unique.
[01:33:55.380 --> 01:33:56.980]   It's Andrew Horowitz.
[01:33:56.980 --> 01:33:58.980]   Andrew Horowitz.
[01:33:58.980 --> 01:34:00.860]   And forget about me.
[01:34:00.860 --> 01:34:03.060]   I'm long gone now.
[01:34:03.060 --> 01:34:04.660]   Andrew, thank you so much for joining us.
[01:34:04.660 --> 01:34:06.580]   Congratulations on getting the book on audible.com.
[01:34:06.580 --> 01:34:07.580]   I know it's a success.
[01:34:07.580 --> 01:34:10.860]   The discipline investor.com is his site and his podcast.
[01:34:10.860 --> 01:34:11.860]   I must listen.
[01:34:11.860 --> 01:34:12.940]   It's a really good show.
[01:34:12.940 --> 01:34:14.540]   Really well produced, by the way, Andrew.
[01:34:14.540 --> 01:34:15.540]   Thanks.
[01:34:15.540 --> 01:34:16.540]   John Perkins.
[01:34:16.540 --> 01:34:17.540]   Don't forget about that.
[01:34:17.540 --> 01:34:18.540]   Two weeks.
[01:34:18.540 --> 01:34:19.540]   In two weeks, he's going to talk to the hitman, John.
[01:34:19.540 --> 01:34:20.540]   Did you know that?
[01:34:20.540 --> 01:34:21.540]   No, I told you he told me that.
[01:34:21.540 --> 01:34:23.060]   I'm going to check it out for sure.
[01:34:23.060 --> 01:34:24.820]   Yeah, that's so cool.
[01:34:24.820 --> 01:34:26.780]   And he is the great Will Harris.
[01:34:26.780 --> 01:34:27.780]   We love having you on.
[01:34:27.780 --> 01:34:28.780]   Thank you, Will.
[01:34:28.780 --> 01:34:33.060]   And staying up late and showing up on stick am, we were able to watch you.
[01:34:33.060 --> 01:34:34.700]   I would have liked to see you, John.
[01:34:34.700 --> 01:34:36.020]   Get beat red.
[01:34:36.020 --> 01:34:37.820]   Next time, would you get a camera hooked up for us?
[01:34:37.820 --> 01:34:39.660]   I'm in mind to wear.
[01:34:39.660 --> 01:34:40.940]   All the better.
[01:34:40.940 --> 01:34:43.060]   Victoria will love you for that.
[01:34:43.060 --> 01:34:44.060]   Veronica.
[01:34:44.060 --> 01:34:46.860]   No, I was talking about somebody else.
[01:34:46.860 --> 01:34:48.860]   No.
[01:34:48.860 --> 01:34:50.100]   We thank you all for joining us.
[01:34:50.100 --> 01:34:51.100]   And we hope we'll see you next week.
[01:34:51.100 --> 01:34:52.100]   Another Twit.
[01:34:52.100 --> 01:34:53.100]   This is amazing.
[01:34:53.100 --> 01:34:54.100]   Is in the can.
[01:34:54.100 --> 01:34:55.100]   [MUSIC]
[01:34:55.100 --> 01:34:56.100]   Round the horn.
[01:34:56.100 --> 01:34:57.100]   Round the horn.
[01:34:57.100 --> 01:34:58.100]   Round the horn.
[01:34:58.100 --> 01:34:59.100]   Round the horn.

[01:35:02.100 --> 01:35:03.100]   Round the horn.
[01:35:03.100 --> 01:35:04.100]   Round the horn.
[01:35:04.100 --> 01:35:05.100]   Round the horn.
[01:35:05.100 --> 01:35:06.100]   Round the horn.
[01:35:06.100 --> 01:35:07.100]   Round the horn.
[01:35:07.100 --> 01:35:08.100]   Round the horn.
[01:35:08.100 --> 01:35:09.100]   Round the horn.
[01:35:09.100 --> 01:35:10.100]   Round the horn.
[01:35:10.100 --> 01:35:11.100]   Round the horn.

[01:35:19.100 --> 01:35:20.100]   I should have paid attention.
[01:35:20.100 --> 01:35:21.100]   I don't know what I'm going to do.
[01:35:21.100 --> 01:35:22.100]   Too much work.
[01:35:22.100 --> 01:35:24.100]   The problem is, there's no limit.
[01:35:24.100 --> 01:35:25.100]   My server is completely collapsed.
