[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.840]   week's news in the world of technology we've got.
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:16.200]   Where is Will?
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:17.080]   Will Harris.
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:19.000]   I know where he is, he's in Oxford, up late.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:20.840]   Once again, hey Will.
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.280]   Hello, how's it going?
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.480]   It's only what, 930 and 9?
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.480]   No, it's 1030.
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:25.480]   1030.
[00:01:25.480 --> 00:01:26.480]   That's positive.
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:27.480]   Yeah, early.
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:33.680]   Why is London time different from universal coordinated time?
[00:01:33.680 --> 00:01:35.480]   Because of daylight savings.
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:36.480]   Ah.
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:38.720]   See that threw me for the longest time.
[00:01:38.720 --> 00:01:43.480]   I thought GMT and UTC would be the same, but they're not.
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:45.720]   No, it all changes depending on the time of the year.
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:47.680]   All right, so we're not in summertime right now.
[00:01:47.680 --> 00:01:49.640]   Robert Herron could probably have explained that to me.
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:50.800]   He would know that kind of thing.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:52.960]   He is of course the star now of DLTV.
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.040]   Now that that Patrick guy is gone.
[00:01:55.040 --> 00:01:56.040]   Gone.
[00:01:56.040 --> 00:01:57.040]   Gone I say.
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:01:58.040]   No.
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:01:59.040]   How's it going?
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:00.040]   Are you and Roger are hosting?
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:01.040]   Yeah.
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:02.040]   And it's a, you know what?
[00:02:02.040 --> 00:02:04.760]   I think the first couple episodes might have been a little rough, but the last couple I've
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:06.320]   actually been quite pleased with.
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.320]   Roger's great.
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:08.320]   Everybody loves me.
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:13.000]   He is a trooper and I've taught him not to read the emails as frequently.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.800]   It's just glaze over.
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:18.240]   Don't don't don't don't don't don't that stress over every little read down.
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:19.240]   No, never read.
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:20.800]   Anybody can write anything they want.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:21.800]   Exactly.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:22.800]   Exactly.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:25.560]   I'm looking for Patrick Norton to join us a little bit later on.
[00:02:25.560 --> 00:02:28.080]   He apparently has a plumbing emergency.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.840]   Do you want anybody want to elaborate?
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:33.840]   I think is it like a metaphorical plumbing?
[00:02:33.840 --> 00:02:35.920]   No, it's real plumbing actual plumbing.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:37.640]   I actually saw the problem.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:39.080]   It's his kitchen sink.
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:40.600]   It just won't turn off.
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:44.400]   And it's it's wasting an incredible amount of water.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.720]   Well, I think that that's appropriate.
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:48.280]   We are all for water conservation here.
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:51.040]   So Patrick, go ahead and fix that.
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:02:52.640]   And as if he gets it fixed.
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:54.240]   I hope he gets it fixed.
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:03:00.800]   We'll we'll make sure we get him on the on the Skype as soon as he shows up.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.800]   Lots of stories to talk about.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.360]   Actually, Robert, I'm very glad you're here because a lot of these stories have to do
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:10.040]   with your particular area of expertise, which is a home theater and high-def TV.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.640]   But before we even get to those news stories, you were at CDIA in Denver last week.
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:17.640]   It's the big it's the installer show, right?
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:22.080]   Yeah, the Consumer Electronic Design and Installation Association has their annual show.
[00:03:22.080 --> 00:03:27.000]   Last couple of years of spending done for Colorado and this year was as awesome as it
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   always is.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.640]   I want to think of that as kind of a niche show.
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:34.400]   I mean, they got, you know, popcorn machines and couches, but it's but a lot of technology
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:35.400]   gets shown there too.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:36.400]   Yeah.
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:37.400]   Oh, indeed.
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:40.360]   And plus it's where I go to get the preview of all of the latest high definition TVs,
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:45.480]   new projectors, new screen technologies, and just updates in general, set top boxes as
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:46.480]   well.
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:48.720]   But in addition, it's also the furniture.
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:51.920]   Every other aspect speakers are a huge portion of it.
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:56.240]   In addition to home automation is arguably one of the bigger sides of it as well.
[00:03:56.240 --> 00:03:59.880]   Just a way of bringing it all together and making it either look right, perform the
[00:03:59.880 --> 00:04:02.520]   way you want or just simplifying the whole experience.
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:07.200]   And it's just a training session too for hundreds and thousands of people who come by
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.800]   who take courses in various either installation techniques or calibration or even marketing
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:14.720]   and other aspects of home theater as well.
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:16.880]   So these are installation pros, basically.
[00:04:16.880 --> 00:04:17.880]   Exactly.
[00:04:17.880 --> 00:04:21.560]   And you come there to actually be trained or to just get advice and updates in terms of
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:23.240]   what's what in the industry.
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.520]   And yet the stuff they're installing is the same stuff I'm going to buy and put my living
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:27.520]   room right.
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:31.760]   I mean, it's not, I'm not going to put in a screen that opens when I push a button, but
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:34.800]   you know, a curtain that opens when I push a button, but I might be looking at the same
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:37.400]   plasma sets or projection sets that they look like.
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:38.400]   Exactly.
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.160]   But if you want to see like, what's the latest in mounting technologies?
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:47.160]   What is the latest in control systems for those devices, especially for the high end market?
[00:04:47.160 --> 00:04:52.520]   I mean, relatively high end where you're either doing, you know, say a 30 or $40,000 room all
[00:04:52.520 --> 00:04:55.760]   the way on up to, you know, million dollar rooms and what kind of equipment would you
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:05:00.120]   be considering for those environments and how and how do you differentiate it from what
[00:05:00.120 --> 00:05:01.120]   other people matter?
[00:05:01.120 --> 00:05:02.920]   What do you get in a million dollar room?
[00:05:02.920 --> 00:05:05.480]   Oh, I'm building a room for the ground up.
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.080]   You get 108 inch LCD.
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.480]   No, no, it's all front projection at that point.
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:14.440]   You're not dealing with any kind of flat panel whatsoever.
[00:05:14.440 --> 00:05:18.440]   The really the big expanse goes into the room design itself, designing the room, a coast
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.240]   for acoustics and isolating the room from the rest of the environment in terms of sound
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:24.240]   in particular.
[00:05:24.240 --> 00:05:25.240]   That's interesting.
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:31.760]   If you if prices money is no object, you would buy a projector, not a direct view display.
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:32.760]   Of course.
[00:05:32.760 --> 00:05:33.760]   Why?
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:34.760]   Of course.
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.640]   That is what cinema is and and the technologies that are available in front projection aren't
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:42.880]   available in most flat panel or rear projection technologies.
[00:05:42.880 --> 00:05:48.960]   Especially when it comes to film based content, the 24 P material that you see with HD DVD
[00:05:48.960 --> 00:05:50.400]   and Blu-ray.
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.920]   There are no displays out there that can process that properly short of certain panel or certain
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:58.880]   pioneer plasmas can, but there are quite a few front projectors on the other hand, which
[00:05:58.880 --> 00:06:05.240]   can take that 24 P content and display it and say 48 Hertz, which makes it for a very
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.840]   smooth presentation and and for just simple screen size as well.
[00:06:08.840 --> 00:06:15.320]   If you're going to do 130 140 or larger inch screen, you're you're talking front projector.
[00:06:15.320 --> 00:06:17.160]   You're not talking a flat panel technology.
[00:06:17.160 --> 00:06:18.160]   Right.
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:21.720]   Well, certainly when I go to the movies these days and I go to my local cinema, it's a
[00:06:21.720 --> 00:06:22.720]   DLP.
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:27.400]   It's a Christie DLP usually, you know, DLP front projection of I guess the same kind you
[00:06:27.400 --> 00:06:30.160]   could buy in a million dollar home.
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:31.160]   Exactly.
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:35.360]   They also let's see they use three chip systems for those where they use a usually a prism
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:40.600]   split light source into red, blue and green and then each deal chip processes that color
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:43.320]   independently and they can remix together before it hits the screen.
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:46.040]   And that's arguably one of the best ways to do it.
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:49.480]   That gives you the best motion performance when you can do a three chip system.
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.120]   I don't want to get sidetracked here because it's going to turn into the home theater thing.
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.560]   But I totally ask you because we were talking on on Friday and you mentioned something that
[00:06:55.560 --> 00:06:57.440]   kind of scared me.
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:02.160]   You're you've been running some tests on motion between LCDs and plasma screens.
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:03.160]   Exactly.
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.840]   Big trends I noticed that this year's show was that all of the LCD manufacturers are touting
[00:07:07.840 --> 00:07:12.920]   ways that they can improve image fidelity with moving content or when when things are moving
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:13.920]   on the screen.
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:18.320]   It turns out that LCDs are generally very poor at keeping a clear picture or not smearing
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:19.320]   the picture.
[00:07:19.320 --> 00:07:24.400]   Is that because of the latency in the screen exactly switching from one state to a different
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:27.760]   state for each LCD pixel is generally a slow process.
[00:07:27.760 --> 00:07:32.840]   It's a response time right in the man measured in milliseconds usually you know it's for an
[00:07:32.840 --> 00:07:35.240]   LCD it's 10 or more milliseconds.
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:39.360]   Yeah and I'll be honest the response time figures that are usually stated are pretty
[00:07:39.360 --> 00:07:40.800]   useless generally speaking.
[00:07:40.800 --> 00:07:42.400]   You have to drive on it.
[00:07:42.400 --> 00:07:43.400]   Yeah.
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:47.200]   However there the latest trend has been 120 Hertz imagery.
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:49.120]   It's not it's not capable.
[00:07:49.120 --> 00:07:51.600]   These panels aren't capable accepting 120 Hertz signal.
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:57.600]   What they're doing is taking that 60 Hertz signal and adding interpolated frames in between
[00:07:57.600 --> 00:08:01.680]   and that helps to smooth the picture out and produce a more clear less smeared picture
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:02.680]   and it does help.
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:06.720]   It is a step above the traditional 60 Hertz panels you'll see out there but it still is
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:11.640]   no comparison to what you'll see on even a modest plasma display right now in terms of
[00:08:11.640 --> 00:08:15.920]   being able to handle scenes that move and I just happened to acquire a new Blu-ray based
[00:08:15.920 --> 00:08:20.480]   test disc that that really highlighted the fact for me in the lab or I could put up the
[00:08:20.480 --> 00:08:26.280]   display side by side run similar real world content in a mix of test pattern content and
[00:08:26.280 --> 00:08:31.440]   see just clearly that that plasma's produced a clearer picture when things are moving.
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:35.280]   Now with static imagery yes you get usually you get as detailed of an image with either
[00:08:35.280 --> 00:08:40.200]   display technology but with things containing motion which is you know your action movies
[00:08:40.200 --> 00:08:47.120]   a panning sequence in a lot of films it is surprising what you lose on an LCD panel in
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:52.520]   terms of image quality and just the softness and it's harder on the eyes and it's a it's
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:56.080]   more fatiguing to watch really and that was one of the good things I've seen here.
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:59.920]   So arguably JVC is ahead of the game in terms of LCD right now because they're on their
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:04.800]   second generation of motion performance improvements whereas most companies have just started with
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:09.640]   their first generation with the current line and I'm itching at digital life actually
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:13.840]   a couple weeks in New York City I'll be able to I'll have at least one of their panels
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:18.440]   set up there to show off and hopefully soon after I'll have that in the lab for testing.
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:22.560]   Pioneer showed its new Kuro line of plasmas.
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:23.960]   Absolutely beautiful.
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:26.160]   So it means what black in Japanese.
[00:09:26.160 --> 00:09:31.320]   Yeah and that's it really they gave their engineers a blank not a blank check necessarily
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:35.640]   but a lot of them go back and redesign the panel from the ground up and the biggest improvements
[00:09:35.640 --> 00:09:40.200]   were in black level in particular they found a new way to drive the panel when it is displaying
[00:09:40.200 --> 00:09:44.480]   black where it uses very little electricity hence it produces very little light and makes
[00:09:44.480 --> 00:09:50.280]   it very very dark which in turn helps apparent image contrast and it makes color pop a little
[00:09:50.280 --> 00:09:54.720]   better too and the panels they had on display were everything from their elite series and
[00:09:54.720 --> 00:09:59.840]   their standard series which are also Kuro as well and so that's going to just place all
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:00.840]   the panels.
[00:10:00.840 --> 00:10:06.200]   Yeah gorgeous gorgeous panels in general and Sharp was showing off or they mentioned that
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:11.080]   they're about to build a 10th generation plant in a Sakai City Japan and they were showing
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:17.400]   off their new mother glass whenever they build a new facility for building LCD panels it enables
[00:10:17.400 --> 00:10:23.120]   them to build a larger mother glass sheet and these new sheets whereas last year the plant
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:29.880]   they had just opened could carve out 852 inch panels the new plant can carve out 857 inch
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:32.880]   panels so it's just that's a larger sheet of glass they can work with it once and they're
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:39.200]   also highlighting the fact that a Sharp's combining LCD manufacturing with their solar
[00:10:39.200 --> 00:10:43.160]   cell manufacturing because I guess it both involves thin film transistor technology so
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:47.200]   they're combining both technologies in one plant and hopefully they're looking to dominate
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:52.600]   too in low cost solar cell panels as well but somebody told me they showed four people
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:54.680]   were showing 4k screens too.
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:11:00.000]   Oh it was beautiful that was a JVC demo again they had their prototype DLA which is a L
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.240]   cost technology liquid crystal in silicon they were showing off their 4k projector which
[00:11:04.240 --> 00:11:14.160]   is 4000 pixels by about 2000 pixels 8 megapixel image with actual 4k material I'd never seen
[00:11:14.160 --> 00:11:20.160]   a 4k film before but it was a film called Trident starring David Carradine and they
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:24.640]   showed about five minutes of it and it was a probably what was it about probably a 40
[00:11:24.640 --> 00:11:31.120]   foot screen corner to corner and it was gorgeous it was the black levels were extremely dark
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:36.720]   the whites were very bright there was no bleed the colors were just perfect and the detail
[00:11:36.720 --> 00:11:40.200]   was phenomenal and then they immediately followed that up with some oh they were claiming to
[00:11:40.200 --> 00:11:45.880]   that each frame of this 4k material they were showing each frame that was displayed every
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:51.240]   60th of a second or I think it was every 48th of a second was 50 megabytes of information
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:55.920]   oh my gosh so it was a huge a huge array of drives spinning away pounding this out but
[00:11:55.920 --> 00:12:01.320]   then they switched over to an an 8 megapixel commercial flight simulator program that I
[00:12:01.320 --> 00:12:05.600]   had never seen anything like this before but clearly when the pros are out there driving
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:10.280]   their pro flight simulators it is an amazing looking experience I have to say especially
[00:12:10.280 --> 00:12:14.400]   looking at it on a screen like that how long before we all we all have 4k screens is that
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:20.120]   imminent or is that something that's decades off I that's a good question it is it is coming
[00:12:20.120 --> 00:12:25.080]   and they're looking at even beyond that to AK in the lab right now oh my gosh but so
[00:12:25.080 --> 00:12:30.940]   just when you thought HD was like the pinnacle it's gonna look this bad as as as standard
[00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:35.820]   display that looks now it's gonna be you know we'll go oh HD I would watch that yeah to a
[00:12:35.820 --> 00:12:39.740]   point for the biggest screens is where you're gonna have the the best improvement when you
[00:12:39.740 --> 00:12:45.540]   can do really large home theater right otherwise were all of the material we look at right now
[00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:50.540]   it at its best quality is 1080p materials so there's not there's not a huge compelling
[00:12:50.540 --> 00:12:54.220]   reason to go beyond that at the moment in terms of making displays that figure I mean it was
[00:12:54.220 --> 00:12:58.660]   a big fight just to get most of your high-def TVs you see in the store nowadays to 1080p
[00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:05.380]   resolution right all right well it sounds like CD it was a candy store oh unbelievable
[00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:10.020]   we'll see more I'm sure on DL that TV oh one one just quickie thing THX had a couple of
[00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:14.460]   really cool technologies to that they were showing off one they had the first they're
[00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:19.660]   certifying display technologies now and they showed off their first THX certified LCD which
[00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:24.420]   was very impressive is a sharp panel it's available in Japan but another technology they
[00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:29.340]   feature was something they codename blackbird and quickly it was just a way of them it's
[00:13:29.340 --> 00:13:34.020]   a technology platform that allows content creators to incorporate metadata into their
[00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:39.500]   into their content be it video or audio that simply describes to compatible hardware it's
[00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:45.180]   like hey look I'm I am 16 by 9 format video the display should be in 16 by 9 format it
[00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:49.420]   uses Dolby digital audio or whatever audio format make sure the receivers switch to
[00:13:49.420 --> 00:13:54.020]   that as well and we should be seeing demos of that at CES coming up in a couple months
[00:13:54.020 --> 00:13:57.740]   it's just a way to help simplify the experience so that you know what you're not looking at
[00:13:57.740 --> 00:14:02.540]   your four by three content stretched incorrectly and likewise you're 16 by nine content you
[00:14:02.540 --> 00:14:06.060]   think they've done that right up front because that's I mean one of the biggest pains in
[00:14:06.060 --> 00:14:10.380]   the but is to figure out what you know match everything up oh it really is and it's nothing
[00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:15.340]   more frustrating even walking around on the show floor I saw I saw vendors with their
[00:14:15.340 --> 00:14:19.540]   content being displayed incorrectly and it was like not not a lot of that going on but
[00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:22.980]   there were a couple and it really stood out and you noticed that it's not a city it's
[00:14:22.980 --> 00:14:27.540]   CDO oh my god not the place to do it well we've talked about home theater but I know
[00:14:27.540 --> 00:14:31.740]   that will is champing at the bit to talk about something a little closer to a home
[00:14:31.740 --> 00:14:37.380]   and that is his iPhone he brought it back from New York along with a fiance talks more
[00:14:37.380 --> 00:14:46.260]   about the iPhone these days oh now you're happy you can use it I can open source free
[00:14:46.260 --> 00:14:51.100]   GUI unlock did you use the GUI unlock though you use the command now I didn't so the GUI
[00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:57.380]   unlock came out a couple of days later I sat on the command line doing like you know SSH
[00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:02.340]   into the into the back end of the iPhone all this kind of crazy stuff actually not as
[00:15:02.340 --> 00:15:08.180]   hard as you might think oh it's almost a book should be our our intern is written up on
[00:15:08.180 --> 00:15:12.740]   his site the step by step and that's what I followed I unlocked mine too I've got mine
[00:15:12.740 --> 00:15:17.140]   running on T mobile and it's it it works flawlessly it's very so it's it's brilliant because it's
[00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:22.180]   the first time I've ever used an iPhone as an actual phone and says you know crazy stuff
[00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:27.780]   like the text messaging and you know conference singing calls and stuff unbelievable I just
[00:15:27.780 --> 00:15:32.740]   I'm glad to get out of these clutches now this is funny because I think because of all this
[00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:39.620]   hacking apple has really sped up the announcement of iPhone in Europe the big event is coming
[00:15:39.620 --> 00:15:45.780]   up in just three days is the 18th in London yes at an Apple store and we don't know what
[00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:49.940]   it is but the presumption is it's going to be the announcement yeah and I mean they had
[00:15:49.940 --> 00:15:55.460]   them the guy who's the head of O2 who's which is the cellular network this widely sort of
[00:15:55.460 --> 00:16:00.420]   tip to have it went on record last week as saying you know oh we're not we're not saying
[00:16:00.420 --> 00:16:05.700]   anything but in principle you know we don't find revenue sharing objectionable so you know
[00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:11.460]   who else is putting a revenue sharing deal on the table you know right so so it looks like
[00:16:11.460 --> 00:16:16.500]   it's going to be in the bag but even if they announce it next week the talk is that it's
[00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:22.020]   going to be at least November before it actually arrives on the street and maybe even close
[00:16:22.020 --> 00:16:26.660]   of course maybe even close to Christmas and of course with despite the exchange rate it's
[00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:31.540]   still going to be a heck of a lot more expensive over here and of course if you've got an unlocked
[00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:35.220]   phone then you can choose the carrier that you want and data plan that you want is everybody
[00:16:35.220 --> 00:16:41.620]   GSM in England everybody is GSM in England so you have your choice yeah I mean the downside
[00:16:41.620 --> 00:16:47.140]   is that you know almost everywhere in England there is 3G as well so unlike the US whether
[00:16:47.140 --> 00:16:52.740]   I think you need you guys kind of have patchy 3G coverage English is just blanket 3G so
[00:16:52.740 --> 00:16:58.580]   the lack of 3G is even more kind of kind of jarring but you know you you pay your money
[00:16:58.580 --> 00:17:04.660]   right you take your choice so it's O2 in Britain it'll be orange in France T-Mobile in Germany
[00:17:04.660 --> 00:17:09.620]   that's the that's the latest although again not been confirmed but that's what the expectations are
[00:17:09.620 --> 00:17:16.100]   yeah absolutely but I mean noticeably a lot of the other networks over here have started
[00:17:16.100 --> 00:17:22.180]   updating their hardware to edge as well because we've previously only had some GPRS oh really
[00:17:22.180 --> 00:17:28.660]   but O2 is rolled out edge now we're starting to see Vodafone and T-Mobile all come online
[00:17:28.660 --> 00:17:35.060]   with edge stuff for various you know reasons data was very important when you start using
[00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:40.820]   devices any kind of smartphone it's all about the data really the phone comes second I'm holding
[00:17:40.820 --> 00:17:46.180]   out for an HS DPA phone right now well there you know there's been a room I have actually kind of
[00:17:46.180 --> 00:17:51.060]   ignored the rumors that to be a second generation iPhone as early as Christmas but there this rumor
[00:17:51.060 --> 00:17:56.180]   is very persistent that there will be an HS DPA iPhone by Christmas in the States I don't know if
[00:17:56.180 --> 00:18:00.980]   that's the case because the networks are being built up right now I had a quick question about
[00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:05.540]   the iPhone mods though if you wanted to could you totally restore it back to its original condition
[00:18:05.540 --> 00:18:11.220]   hold on sack here we want to get Patrick into the mix Patrick your your sink is stopped overflowing
[00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:17.620]   yes had to shut down the water to the house to replace some washers happened to me in the
[00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:22.580]   middle of the night one night a pipe burst under my sink and my it was like me and my seven-year-old
[00:18:22.580 --> 00:18:27.700]   daughter we're going and it's hot water and I'm happy quick that it turned off the water she's
[00:18:27.700 --> 00:18:34.180]   what daddy what what turn off the water what daddy where's the water water oh and this gracious we
[00:18:34.180 --> 00:18:38.580]   had a flood we had a three or four inches well I'm glad you you've got it fixed so welcome we're we've
[00:18:38.580 --> 00:18:43.220]   already talked about cedia with Robert and we're now talking about the fact that not only by the way
[00:18:43.220 --> 00:18:47.220]   I didn't point this out not only is will hack his iPhone but I have hacked my iPhone I wasn't
[00:18:47.220 --> 00:18:54.900]   to T mobile I wasn't willing to do this to my own phone but uh but very you know and I've
[00:18:54.900 --> 00:18:59.300]   mentioned this a few times that I've come real close and just can't go I don't want to break my
[00:18:59.300 --> 00:19:05.300]   phone and that's so wrong I don't want to break my phone so a pawnbroker believe it or not a very
[00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:10.820]   kindly a guy named David MacArthur who is a pawnbroker in ballmer he has two palms he says you know
[00:19:10.820 --> 00:19:15.780]   what we're getting a lot of phones back uh pawned phones uh why don't I just send you one you can
[00:19:15.780 --> 00:19:22.260]   hack that one hey if he gets any uh good mac tools ratchet ranches or handfits he can check me an
[00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:28.660]   email I'm sure he will Patrick I'm sure Patrick likes his tools so he said I got it yesterday and
[00:19:28.660 --> 00:19:34.020]   uh just like you will I mean I sat down I followed Shubey's instructions it's the same ones the key
[00:19:34.020 --> 00:19:39.300]   is getting the the right jailbreak program I tried on iFuntastic which is a mac program couldn't get
[00:19:39.300 --> 00:19:43.940]   it to work it's a windows program called iBricker which apparently works better but I ended up using
[00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:48.820]   a null river a program called something like app tap that really was great and by the way in the
[00:19:48.820 --> 00:19:53.700]   process you also get all these third party applications you can install I'm just I'm just
[00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:58.500]   trying to get over the idea of running an application called iBricker on my un-dollar cell phone
[00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:02.580]   couldn't do it that's exactly right so I figured well here's a here's you know here's a pawn you
[00:20:02.580 --> 00:20:07.380]   know a phone that I got for nothing and uh thank you David and it's working and I put my T-Mobile chip
[00:20:07.380 --> 00:20:11.860]   in and it's amazing it really works so to answer your question Robert which Robert was just asking
[00:20:11.860 --> 00:20:17.380]   before we picked you up Patrick it's my understanding that because these are just software hacks at any
[00:20:17.380 --> 00:20:23.620]   point you can restore the phone with the with the restore uh iTunes restore so yeah so if you if you
[00:20:23.620 --> 00:20:29.140]   just use iTunes restore you won't actually you won't undo the hack because the hack is written into
[00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:34.660]   the modem firmware baseband and most restores don't overwrite the baseband so what you need is to
[00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:43.300]   actually go back and re manually re-flash the modem firmware how do you do that with uh will you can
[00:20:43.300 --> 00:20:48.980]   you can get the the firmware in a file or actually the rumor is that the next iPhone update uh it's
[00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:53.220]   going to overwrite the uh the modem baseband which will do it for you yeah that's going to be the
[00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:58.340]   interesting question i'm going to hold off on 1.03 because i'm not i have a feeling that we'll
[00:20:58.340 --> 00:21:05.060]   yeah although is this the sorry go ahead is this the only way to get third party applications on
[00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:09.220]   the iPhone right now well there's this is a two-step process yes the you have to do what's
[00:21:09.220 --> 00:21:14.580]   called jailbreak it to get third party apps on um but that's just the first part of unlocking it
[00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:21.220]   so there's really two hacks going on and then you know believe me wait until you see this you know
[00:21:21.220 --> 00:21:27.380]   you the ssh commands you're using to uh to uh i unlock it and that's what i guess that explains
[00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:33.540]   it now will while you're doing these at commands is you're doing what looks like mo mo yeah
[00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:38.820]   haze modem commands here yep absolutely yeah and you know you're um reconfiguring the
[00:21:38.820 --> 00:21:44.340]   the modem that's actually in it that's which is kind of uh which is kind of crazy that's really
[00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:49.460]   that's really that's it's a Macintosh duo 280 and my parents have i mean this is a it's all it's
[00:21:49.460 --> 00:21:55.860]   like going back in time apple interestingly this week greg jazuiac jaz they call him who is uh uh
[00:21:56.420 --> 00:22:00.980]   uh apple i think apple vice president uh said that apple doesn't oppose
[00:22:00.980 --> 00:22:07.220]   then now it's very lawyerly language so i should probably read the quotes exactly but this is pc
[00:22:07.220 --> 00:22:14.100]   magazine talk to him doesn't oppose native software development they take a neutral stance on you
[00:22:14.100 --> 00:22:20.980]   hacking your phone to put native apps on it they say now we're not gonna we're not gonna get involved
[00:22:20.980 --> 00:22:27.300]   if you have a problem and we're not gonna enable third party apps but if you want to risk breaking
[00:22:27.300 --> 00:22:31.220]   your hardware so we have to tell you you have to buy a new piece of hardware to replace the one
[00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:35.940]   you trash by putting on the third piece of the third party solved with it which we don't mind
[00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:42.020]   we're good with that now so actually so that so the anything was that he there was a sort of
[00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:47.380]   mini-retraction from from the jozwiac statement a couple of days later which was that he said you
[00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:52.980]   were we're kind of neutral we don't endorse it and we don't know what's going to happen with
[00:22:52.980 --> 00:22:57.380]   future updates well they say specifically software updates will most likely break these
[00:22:57.380 --> 00:23:02.740]   third yeah and they then went back from that and said we're almost certainly gonna you know screw
[00:23:02.740 --> 00:23:09.060]   you over but but but it doesn't violate the warranty i guess or whatever i don't know but
[00:23:09.060 --> 00:23:13.460]   see we've gone one step farther and i can guarantee you while they haven't said anything about unlocking
[00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:18.260]   the iphone they don't like this because everybody seems to agree apples getting a piece of the
[00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:23.300]   action from atnt on my monthly bill so if i'm going over to t mobile they're not getting anything
[00:23:23.300 --> 00:23:29.620]   by the way yeah but then you have to think like you know how much how much love does apple have
[00:23:29.620 --> 00:23:35.220]   for atnt when it's introducing you know the ring tones and the wireless ichun store where atnt
[00:23:35.220 --> 00:23:40.740]   is just cut out of the loop entirely that's a good point it's a an interesting article i don't
[00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:44.180]   know if i believe it daniel silger writing and roughly drafted he's been on the show before
[00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:49.780]   uh or mac break weekly i guess said um seemed seemed to make a pretty good case that apple didn't
[00:23:49.780 --> 00:23:54.660]   even want to charge for those ring tones but was required to by the ri a because these are
[00:23:54.660 --> 00:24:00.580]   derivative works ri a interestingly enough does not pass the revenue along to the artists
[00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:07.380]   it's not a performer's royalty it goes right in the bite of the label pure profit it's pure profit
[00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:11.780]   and what's even more what's even more crazy is that even if you buy a tune from the i-tunes ring
[00:24:11.780 --> 00:24:16.900]   from the i-tune store like there's no guarantee that you can convert that into a ring tone because
[00:24:16.900 --> 00:24:21.460]   only certain tunes on the store you can then have the rights to half a million of them are yeah
[00:24:21.460 --> 00:24:25.860]   this is probably from the same brilliant ri a team actually i take it back at sony who came
[00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:30.740]   up with the wringle the cd wringle have you guys heard about this oh gosh go ahead tell us about
[00:24:30.740 --> 00:24:36.900]   it this blows my face it's because okay cd singles you know basically 45 single started to die out
[00:24:36.900 --> 00:24:41.060]   but cassette singles kissingles started to become very popular and the cassette died and there was
[00:24:41.060 --> 00:24:46.500]   never really seem to be a huge market for the cd single um so now what they're doing is they're
[00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:52.900]   taking a hit a couple of b tracks or remixes and throwing on a couple of ring tones on it and
[00:24:52.900 --> 00:24:58.580]   as sony and umg are leading the pack sony's own came up with the idea and october november this year
[00:24:58.580 --> 00:25:03.860]   you'll be able to buy cd wringle packs you will lot them but you'll be able to buy them
[00:25:04.500 --> 00:25:08.580]   now and of course sweet snow guarantee will work on your phone because many many
[00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:12.260]   carriers in the states like verizon just you know no sorry you got to buy it from us
[00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:17.140]   but that's it's amazing how many hacks there are to get around true
[00:25:17.140 --> 00:25:22.340]   the those systems that people have well and both companies have set up in fact one of the first
[00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:27.620]   things you do when you install the you know the application jailbreak on here is is put up
[00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:30.820]   app there's a great application allows you to take any song and make it a ring tone so
[00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:36.180]   that's you know that's almost instantaneous so that's easy to easily done in the fact i think
[00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:41.860]   there's at least ambrosia software and a few other companies who are making ring tone software you
[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:46.020]   know that will take a song and make a ring tone for the i-phone it's pretty hard to stop people from
[00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:51.460]   doing that not easy to do on a motor roll of phone you have to use bitpim and weird stuff like that
[00:25:51.460 --> 00:25:54.340]   oh bitpims one i love bitpim oh but it's such a hack
[00:25:54.340 --> 00:25:58.980]   yeah but you know what it's bitpim allowed me to do a lot of stuff that
[00:25:59.780 --> 00:26:04.340]   well yeah or you know i had a great i think it was an lg i came up with an lg or a samsung phone
[00:26:04.340 --> 00:26:09.540]   and there was no software from anybody supporting that i won list i wanted to buy a particularly obscure
[00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:17.300]   $50 third-party application and uh and i downloaded bitpim which is free and it allowed me access to
[00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:22.020]   all you know it allowed me to pull all of my phone numbers off of there to transfer files on to it
[00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:26.180]   it was and it was a thousand times easier than using the weird little program that came to pull
[00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:31.780]   photos off the phone well it makes me crazy that the the phone companies keep still to this day
[00:26:31.780 --> 00:26:35.940]   are keeping people from doing things like that the hardware their own content on their own hardware
[00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:41.220]   and the phone company gets in between you i just Leo we've created a fantastic wireless
[00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:46.420]   infrastructure and make these phones available to people at a vast discount i think it's only fair
[00:26:46.420 --> 00:26:51.060]   that we're allowed to recoup revenue and investment by forcing people to use obscure online applications
[00:26:51.060 --> 00:26:54.980]   tied into a per-use fee that allows us a continuing revenue stream that will in turn
[00:26:54.980 --> 00:26:58.980]   Leo allows to keep bringing you those wonderful phones you keep buying over and over again and
[00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:03.940]   we want to thank you for your continued support this is a this telecom industry running character
[00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:12.660]   on to what we call Billy Bob Verizon and thank you Billy Bob, Billy Bob PR. This is one for uh for
[00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:20.420]   Robert uh Blue Ray um uh versus HD DVD Battle might face a third contender from a London-based
[00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:29.140]   company New Media Man surprises. Versatile Media Disc 1080p HD screens under two. This is like a
[00:27:29.140 --> 00:27:34.980]   bad dilbert cartoon what we need here is a third competitor but if it's really a new emissidia
[00:27:34.980 --> 00:27:40.980]   did you see it yeah actually i had the demo presented at cedia met with the company it's
[00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:47.220]   tall bucks yeah the players will be anywhere from 150 to 200 dollars they have a decent list of
[00:27:47.220 --> 00:27:53.220]   launch titles coming how did they do that uh essentially what they're working with is a red
[00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:58.180]   laser technology so that their big push is that the current disc replicators have them will have
[00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:04.340]   a very easy time switching over to producing content on this format and they're looking at
[00:28:04.340 --> 00:28:08.660]   using multiple layers of red laser because you're only getting about less than five gigs per layer
[00:28:08.660 --> 00:28:13.940]   so they're stacking upwards of three or more layers on these discs in order to provide enough space
[00:28:13.940 --> 00:28:18.580]   to provide 1080p content in that format no major studios but they do have Mel Gibson
[00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:24.420]   they had a they actually both demos i saw was i saw a poco lipdo and i saw we were soldiers
[00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:30.820]   yeah they got the entire tips and catalog it was pretty much but there's also that a list of uh
[00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:35.620]   upcoming movies as well and it included some some relatively current films and i was uh i'll
[00:28:35.620 --> 00:28:40.660]   just be curious to see if if this can take off or not in the face of just all right we have these
[00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:45.780]   two competing high-def disc formats already in addition to our other DVD content and they've got
[00:28:45.780 --> 00:28:51.620]   everybody in their pocket you know if you're not if you're not a sony partner anyway uh then the HD
[00:28:51.620 --> 00:28:57.220]   DVD forums giving you a bunch of money to produce your discs on HD DVD i mean they've got an uphill
[00:28:57.220 --> 00:29:03.780]   battle though i think for content exactly and is this different from like china DVD yeah see that's
[00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:12.660]   like yes it is it's really the four five-def format uh oh what happened to patrick he's wandered off
[00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:20.580]   i don't know so uh should we worry about this uh robert should we uh should we hold off i've
[00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:25.060]   just into me it gives me just another reason not to buy an HD DVD or Blu-ray player
[00:29:25.060 --> 00:29:30.660]   uh you know what the other thing well in this case i'm i'm not that concerned about this format
[00:29:30.660 --> 00:29:35.300]   really the one thing people might instantly assume as well if you can do these inexpensive red laser
[00:29:35.300 --> 00:29:40.020]   discs that store upwards of 30 gigs you know that hey that sounds great for the pc environment but
[00:29:40.020 --> 00:29:44.420]   no this is strictly for the the disc replicators not for you're not going to have any kind of drive
[00:29:44.420 --> 00:29:48.340]   technology that will allow you to burn this kind of content yourself right uh that's just one thing
[00:29:48.340 --> 00:29:54.420]   to point out the demos look solid the technology looks solid the the protection for the content
[00:29:54.420 --> 00:30:00.500]   owners is there it literally will just come down to acceptance and and do people really want to
[00:30:00.500 --> 00:30:04.900]   to mess around and have yet another disc player stacked in their array of hardware at home
[00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:09.780]   granted inexpensive as it is and it should be relatively cheap i mean the most expensive
[00:30:09.780 --> 00:30:14.420]   player they currently announced is 199 and the discs themselves should be dirt cheap as well
[00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:19.940]   so there's possibility there however at cd as well they also showed off uh lg and samson
[00:30:19.940 --> 00:30:25.300]   both showed off brand new dual format players for the hd con or the hd disc format so
[00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:29.540]   it's getting to the point where you know what don't worry about the war anymore
[00:30:29.540 --> 00:30:33.620]   hold out for the price of these combo players to come down and then you don't have to worry about
[00:30:33.620 --> 00:30:38.980]   whether it's blu ray or hd dv your your disc player's gonna play it just fine and the key with these
[00:30:38.980 --> 00:30:44.980]   this latest generation of uh combo players is that they they support all of the features now of both
[00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:50.820]   formats uh blu ray and hd d d hd dv d which of the counties coming forward now with these blue ray
[00:30:50.820 --> 00:30:57.300]   recorders 50 gigabytes of disc and they're fast right i mean they're 4x yeah i mean go go into a
[00:30:57.300 --> 00:31:02.020]   store and try to find a 50 gig recordable uh good luck uh we have the recorders but no media
[00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:10.260]   yeah no media and and if you priced out the cost of even a slice of 25 gig media that's really
[00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:16.500]   prohibitive i haven't seen it under 20 bucks a slice yet so i'm uh it's it's ridiculous you're
[00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:21.540]   still better off if you can authoring two regular red laser technologies i mean that's that's where
[00:31:21.540 --> 00:31:27.060]   the cost benefit is and a lot of the new disc authoring tools even even the consumer versions
[00:31:27.060 --> 00:31:32.340]   will allow you to author two red laser in a in a format that's compatible with the high def
[00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:36.180]   disc formats at least you're not going to have a lot of space to work with but you could still put
[00:31:36.180 --> 00:31:40.500]   like say 20 minutes of content on there we didn't mention this uh last week but on
[00:31:40.500 --> 00:31:46.340]   thursday last thursday a week ago thursday um microsoft had its annual meeting at safe co-field
[00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:58.020]   in seattle and bill gates said so long goodbye see you later okay well that was that was that
[00:31:58.020 --> 00:32:03.780]   is finally it's good ray aussie came up he's gonna he's gonna replace gates in terms of the vision
[00:32:04.580 --> 00:32:10.180]   uh and spoke but uh gates swan song speech was tepidly i'm reading from computer world
[00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:14.340]   tepidly received by many attendees who said it was just like all the other speeches
[00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:24.180]   so it doesn't leave he put no effort into it apparently is he no longer with microsoft well he
[00:32:24.180 --> 00:32:29.540]   when is his retirement i think it's january you know he'll be chairman of the board or something
[00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:35.460]   but he's not gonna get you today it's funny how little ink this is getting i mean this is the
[00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:41.460]   guy it's a protracted goodbye is that so but you mean arguably he's the most important person in
[00:32:41.460 --> 00:32:49.460]   the computer industry and uh she's you know okay see you nice nice knowing you uh thanks for all
[00:32:49.460 --> 00:32:54.180]   time plan perfect yeah well that's what he's gonna do exactly yeah well let's do it just a good i'm
[00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:58.100]   sure he'll take all that money and put it but i think everyone is aware that you know he hasn't
[00:32:58.100 --> 00:33:04.260]   really had much he's been doing it Microsoft for a long time now hold for it's not enough to do
[00:33:04.260 --> 00:33:10.100]   anything for quite some time prince is getting active did you see what the prince wants to reclaim
[00:33:10.100 --> 00:33:15.540]   his art on the internet now this explain this to men the village people right and the village
[00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:22.340]   people that okay they're just trying to make a little extra money dm c that that that's a song
[00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:29.860]   we got to put on youtube by the twits um but prince you know who's the guy who didn't he give away his
[00:33:29.860 --> 00:33:35.620]   last cd in the mail well yeah the way nine mill what was it was it a million or nine million
[00:33:35.620 --> 00:33:39.700]   some huge copies in a huge and it was it basically it was with one of the one of the
[00:33:39.700 --> 00:33:44.660]   news the mail's a newspaper i should say yeah not not coming well that's probably a bit generous
[00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:51.700]   but that's a lot of cd so he's he obviously clear on the promotional value of getting your music out
[00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:57.300]   there and of course the yeah the and did you read all the reviews or the the commentaries and
[00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:02.020]   uh prince is never going to be welcome in the uk record stores again it's killing the industry
[00:34:02.020 --> 00:34:09.060]   single-handedly well he's also trying to kill youtube ebay and uh one other site he's suing to get
[00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:13.860]   his his music back a thousand a lot of the mca takedown notices to youtube a thousand clips have

[00:34:53.380 --> 00:34:58.900]   often the uh web sheriff folks have contacted pirate bay and pirate bay's lots of lots of very
[00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:05.620]   amusing responses uh responses to them so yeah it's really funny i just love this dear monkey boys
[00:35:05.620 --> 00:35:12.180]   yeah right we read with creative usement your request it's essentially it yeah it's like lucky
[00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:17.620]   clearly don't understand the law as it applies to us and you can't do anything haha speaking of
[00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:25.140]   which isn't all of mp3 back up and running again yeah what's that don't you good like good luck
[00:35:25.140 --> 00:35:30.260]   trying to shut these guys any of these guys down i mean it's just is it all of mp3.com or are they
[00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:35.460]   still using that other weird let me go to all mp3 spots i think it's cool no they did that but then
[00:35:36.340 --> 00:35:43.380]   i think they're back yeah if you go to all of mp3.com you get redirected to all of mp3.ru
[00:35:43.380 --> 00:35:46.900]   it says the service will be resumed in the foreseeable future
[00:35:46.900 --> 00:35:55.540]   courts rule that all of mp3 operated within the law haha can't believe it jeez
[00:35:55.540 --> 00:36:02.100]   support those drm free music companies like e-music i agree that's the way to go buy indie music
[00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:07.700]   go to e-music and frankly when people like em i and universal start offering their stuff without
[00:36:07.700 --> 00:36:13.700]   dia you know in that drm go support them exactly do it's all the compact disc and you have the
[00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:18.980]   opportunity to buy one almost anywhere i want to download it go for the record store
[00:36:18.980 --> 00:36:25.140]   they're all out of it i take great pleasure in ripping my own music yes the biggest ever you know
[00:36:25.140 --> 00:36:32.020]   go ahead shut no i was gonna say you know 40% of the cd sold in the united states are between
[00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:37.700]   walmart best buy and target that's true and they're pretty much everywhere that's true although apple
[00:36:37.700 --> 00:36:42.980]   the i-tunes music store is number three on that list lie and are you talking about digital music
[00:36:42.980 --> 00:36:48.660]   or overall music sales i thought it was overall music sales isn't it just research let us you
[00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:54.980]   you research while i read about the biggest ever bittorrent leak media defender internal emails
[00:36:54.980 --> 00:37:01.460]   go public wow i'm getting some weird sounds from patrick
[00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:07.780]   when he re-saw i'm sorry i was a type he brings up the squirrels there's been a couple of updates
[00:37:07.780 --> 00:37:16.980]   due to skype lately as well ah maybe that's it uh apparently um 700 megabytes of emails
[00:37:16.980 --> 00:37:24.260]   have gone public media defender was the behind the video site m i i v i how do you pronounce that
[00:37:24.260 --> 00:37:30.260]   me v me me me there my my my but it's basically an anti-piracy group
[00:37:30.260 --> 00:37:38.180]   funded by the mpaa right so they did their own my vi video upload site but the idea of my vi
[00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:46.980]   was to trap you if you upload copyright music boom or more movies they gotcha
[00:37:47.620 --> 00:37:54.740]   sign me up for that boom um but as a result and this is kind of in that pirate day you know
[00:37:54.740 --> 00:38:00.180]   spirit there are companies internal emails dating back over the last six months have been
[00:38:00.180 --> 00:38:06.500]   leaked over at the internet mostly involving senior people i don't know is there a smoking
[00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:12.580]   gun in there it might be fun just to read through it it says according to whoever released these
[00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:17.460]   mbox files by releasing these emails we hope to secure the privacy and personal integrity of
[00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:22.020]   all peer-to-peer users these emails contain information about the various tactics and technical
[00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:26.420]   solutions for tracking peer-to-peer users disrupting peer-to-peer services
[00:38:26.420 --> 00:38:32.980]   and a special thanks to i'm not going to say his name for circumventing their entire email
[00:38:32.980 --> 00:38:38.820]   security they forwarded all the emo i see what they did they sent all their emails to a gmail
[00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:43.940]   account for backup oh my goodness and somebody hacked their gmail account
[00:38:43.940 --> 00:38:51.300]   oops that's nice is that a firing offense you think whoops
[00:38:51.300 --> 00:38:58.420]   uh let's see uh here's a firing offense a german manufacturer median has sold its uh
[00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:04.260]   a number of laptops with a boot sector virus from 1994 on the notebooks
[00:39:06.420 --> 00:39:12.580]   pre-installed with vista home premium and the bully guard antivirus as well as
[00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:20.180]   stoned anjalina and the antivirus and the antivirus that they shipped with it can't remove
[00:39:20.180 --> 00:39:27.140]   stoned angelina even though it's 13 years old that's a far poor old angelina
[00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:34.580]   he said angelina jolly who is stoned angelina and why is she on my laptop any results in your
[00:39:34.580 --> 00:39:38.420]   search i'm just stalling for you right now patty oh i i stopped because
[00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:44.100]   because the type the typing oh that's all right hold on one second i'm sure somebody will send
[00:39:44.100 --> 00:39:55.380]   us an email saying you ignorant fools don't you know everyone knows uh apple now the third largest
[00:39:55.380 --> 00:40:03.220]   online need a phone line okay after walmart and somebody else uh hold on one second
[00:40:03.220 --> 00:40:11.860]   thank you well patrick is looking let's talk about breasts oh awesome sweetie
[00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:19.380]   uh a Canadian mother very special you you'll be interested in this a Canadian mother and
[00:40:19.380 --> 00:40:24.740]   lactavist which i guess is a an activist in favor of lactating mothers
[00:40:24.740 --> 00:40:36.820]   um in her private album had a picture of her breast feeding facebook described the image as
[00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:43.860]   obscene and has etc a notice that says you violated our terms of services photo has been removed
[00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:51.780]   now of course you don't do that to a lactavist she says but if you want to live not if you want
[00:40:51.780 --> 00:40:59.460]   to live anyway um i think i want i do want to thank the uh enquirer for posting the picture
[00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:08.100]   in question and by the way you can't see nothing there's nothing there it is probably because
[00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:12.740]   what was the description for the picture uh that's you think it was based on a description
[00:41:12.740 --> 00:41:17.460]   rather than actually looking at the picture i don't i don't know if i facebook is a clever
[00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:21.300]   company but i don't think they're doing like content analysis on it maybe they just saw the
[00:41:21.300 --> 00:41:28.500]   word breast and they said oh that's bad yeah oh apple inks uh iTunes online music store was the
[00:41:28.500 --> 00:41:32.260]   third biggest overall music retailer in the u.s based on a share of units sold in the first
[00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:39.540]   quarter leap parking ahead of amazon.com and target that's online or not online uh apparently
[00:41:39.540 --> 00:41:45.540]   all all uh retail sales because iTunes was ranked number one behind uh behind number one walmart
[00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:50.660]   stores they're easily the number like they're easily number one online of course so the number
[00:41:50.660 --> 00:41:55.780]   three overall then it shows you that's a lot of power they go well this is in terms of units sold
[00:41:55.780 --> 00:42:00.660]   not revenue from sales right according to the AP business writer that wrote this on units more
[00:42:00.660 --> 00:42:06.820]   important i think units are more important so yeah iTunes had a 10 percent market share amazon.com
[00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:14.020]   6.7 percent target 6.6 percent and the firm counted every 12 tracks purchased online as
[00:42:14.020 --> 00:42:20.660]   equivalent to an album in compact disc format oh that's interesting yeah so are you going to buy a
[00:42:20.660 --> 00:42:29.940]   phenom it's the new AMD it's not atlorn it's phenom sounds a bit strange doesn't it have a
[00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:35.940]   weird name then not only that they announced a three-core processor which is very strange
[00:42:35.940 --> 00:42:39.860]   well i don't think it's announced i think it's rumored oh rumored okay because it
[00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:46.260]   quite i think it's the quad Barcelona is the most recent one and that one yes the bus lena came
[00:42:46.260 --> 00:42:51.940]   out on monday apparently which is the um which is sort of the big release that AMD's been touting
[00:42:51.940 --> 00:42:57.540]   for a long long time it's their first you know quad core server chip and they're calling it a
[00:42:58.100 --> 00:43:02.820]   native quad core because it's it's truly quad core rather than Intel's which is like
[00:43:02.820 --> 00:43:07.460]   two dual cores packaged together right for all the difference that that makes well apparently
[00:43:07.460 --> 00:43:13.620]   not much in the benchmarks is not very impressive well exactly the problem is that you know for the
[00:43:13.620 --> 00:43:20.100]   slight technical inefficiency that having two by two might be compared to the native four
[00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:24.580]   Intel can crank it stuff a heck of a lot faster than AMD can crank it's
[00:43:25.140 --> 00:43:29.860]   i'd say with the Intel chips i've got as a 2.5 gigahertz or something Patrick did you just get a dog or
[00:43:29.860 --> 00:43:37.300]   something uh feeling downstairs with me she was outside and started whining and every once in a
[00:43:37.300 --> 00:43:44.100]   while i hear you go here boy apparently the mute button doesn't work on my head sex oh that
[00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:48.180]   explains it yes the mute button is i should tell you not working in fact i don't think your
[00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:53.300]   headsets are working at all you sound like you're actually talking to the laptop uh Mike yeah that's
[00:43:53.300 --> 00:43:58.660]   gonna do it well the MacBook Pro i'm still trying to resolve the MacBook Pro problem with uh the
[00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:05.700]   internal uh or the uh the line input right yeah that's what we use usb i just let us know i know
[00:44:05.700 --> 00:44:11.860]   that i'll send every time i use usb you complain about the sound quality i can't i can't go back to
[00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:16.580]   the little in the little handset i'll try the usb again maybe it'll work better on the back i thought
[00:44:16.580 --> 00:44:23.460]   this was a very interesting um uh story in cnet they asked a bunch of lawyers about ad blocking
[00:44:23.460 --> 00:44:29.700]   software and the general consensus was you're gonna see a lawsuit in the next year or so as more
[00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:35.140]   and more people use programs like adblock which is a firefox extension and block ads from websites
[00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:40.820]   they're they're cutting into revenue to the point where uh the people like the interactive
[00:44:40.820 --> 00:44:46.340]   advertising bureau are gonna go up against them and say you can't do this anymore iab says it's
[00:44:46.340 --> 00:44:51.940]   not preparing a legal offensive and he'd like to work he'd like to work with software developers
[00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:56.100]   and consumers to come up with one on the middle ground but he says the issue is now ripening
[00:44:56.100 --> 00:45:02.660]   ooh that means they found no way to be able to prosecute the end user that's exactly right
[00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:06.020]   well i hope that they'd go after the end user they'd go after the companies but even then that's
[00:45:06.020 --> 00:45:09.460]   pretty difficult i mean who makes adblock it's probably just some guy right i don't think there's a
[00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:15.860]   company adblock works so well i have a mix i don't i have a mix of feelings about this because on the
[00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:21.140]   one hand i you know ads are what support most of what we do on this podcast and everything i do
[00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:27.460]   for a living but at the same time we know very well for instance that people who visit a website a
[00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:32.100]   lot never click on the ads the ads are almost always clicked on by the first my first time viewers
[00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:36.900]   so i think it's a yeah i'll go ahead and say go and rope it i was just saying my biggest
[00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:42.340]   complaint about most ads being served is that it's from a third party and as long as the webmaster
[00:45:42.340 --> 00:45:46.820]   is ensuring that the site is still performing as quickly as it would be without having those ads
[00:45:46.820 --> 00:45:51.700]   not being served locally it has almost have no problem with it it does just want to page hangs
[00:45:51.700 --> 00:45:56.340]   because of one somebody's ad servers choking well we have that problem i have that problem on
[00:45:56.340 --> 00:46:00.740]   twit and the reason you you don't serve them locally generally is because they they want to count
[00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:08.180]   them yeah and uh you know we've had problems in the past with twit uh dot tv loading slowly because
[00:46:09.060 --> 00:46:13.460]   you know some banner ad on there is uh is not coming in as fast as the rest of the site is and
[00:46:13.460 --> 00:46:17.780]   it is annoying i don't know what you do about it or or if it be if there's a way that they could
[00:46:17.780 --> 00:46:22.580]   load the bulk of the text or the content on the site first and have that display immediately and
[00:46:22.580 --> 00:46:26.740]   then you know what if the ad doesn't appear so be it but that's up to me and i and that that is
[00:46:26.740 --> 00:46:31.140]   something you can code into it okay yeah and that i really should be doing that because i often
[00:46:31.140 --> 00:46:35.540]   watch in the status part of my browser to see what's going on it's like oh waiting for some
[00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:41.380]   bizarre ad server located who knows where and tara no webpage yet granted you know and that's
[00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:46.020]   also probably using a bad ad server because this this whole this whole series of articles came out
[00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:52.100]   of a new york times column back on september 10th um that no one uh wrote out or actually the week
[00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:57.700]   before that actually wrote about adblock plus and that there's a group uh basically a group of uh
[00:46:57.700 --> 00:47:03.700]   webmasters that have gotten together and put a they want to start uh they want to start boycotting
[00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:11.220]   firefox users because so many firefox users are are employing the adblock or plugin or extension
[00:47:11.220 --> 00:47:17.220]   and uh so this is yeah so it's been interesting you can't put in your code i don't want anybody
[00:47:17.220 --> 00:47:21.300]   with adblock or you can only say i don't want anybody with firefox so that's the you know that's
[00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:26.180]   the best you can do he i mean i think he has that side what firefox is blocked.com
[00:47:26.180 --> 00:47:32.740]   that talks about yeah yeah but but yeah but it's been interesting to watch this this this article on
[00:47:33.700 --> 00:47:39.380]   uh this this column in the new york times and uh the paid content dot org picked up on it that
[00:47:39.380 --> 00:47:44.740]   cnet picked up on it's uh and it's there's a lot of apparently a lot of upset webmasters and it's
[00:47:44.740 --> 00:47:48.820]   in our i mean you know robert you pointed out there's nothing worse than when a when a webpage hangs
[00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:53.460]   because some ad server company doesn't have their you know delete that sort of stuff together.
[00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:58.340]   let's say it's just google ad sense which loads fast it's almost always just text they're fairly
[00:47:58.340 --> 00:48:05.300]   unobtrusive um and by the way adblock blocks it too you guys don't like that either.
[00:48:05.300 --> 00:48:12.260]   i don't know i i leave ads i make my living of for the most part through advertising revenue
[00:48:12.260 --> 00:48:17.060]   for the companies that i work for so i never block ads right you know maybe you know it's just
[00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:21.380]   out of personal courtesy well i you know simply i don't block ads either mostly because it doesn't
[00:48:21.380 --> 00:48:26.740]   bother me that much but i'm sympathetic to people who do i don't have any against time yeah but
[00:48:26.740 --> 00:48:31.620]   if i'm in a hurry and i'm on a deadline and i need pages to be flying through my browser you know
[00:48:31.620 --> 00:48:36.020]   i'll enable the damn thing and say you know what it is pretty telling if a page loads
[00:48:36.020 --> 00:48:41.300]   considerably faster without ads that's you know you're paying more a higher price for that ad than
[00:48:41.300 --> 00:48:45.540]   just you know using up space or looking ugly it's slowing you down.
[00:48:45.540 --> 00:48:49.060]   yeah absolutely that's a good argument against it i gotta say
[00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:55.700]   i don't know you know i uh what we discover what we discover with twitter is that just people
[00:48:55.700 --> 00:48:59.860]   aren't willing to pay for content you know some people some small percentage will always donate
[00:48:59.860 --> 00:49:05.380]   and we thank them very much but we have to run ads or uh you know it's just not just not gonna pay
[00:49:05.380 --> 00:49:09.700]   and you know what for the sites that i do visit if there's a relevant ad of a product i'm even
[00:49:09.700 --> 00:49:14.980]   remotely interested in i do try to click on the ads to support that site and give some give them some
[00:49:14.980 --> 00:49:20.900]   you know click through or whatever well the the web you know it's funny i see this all the time i
[00:49:20.900 --> 00:49:27.060]   mean the um and i'm i'm this way too i want stuff free and we we're a little spoiled by the web we
[00:49:27.060 --> 00:49:33.460]   want kind of a lot of free content easily uh downloaded and read and free software and damn you
[00:49:33.460 --> 00:49:39.300]   napster yeah we're spoiled and uh and we forget that the you know somebody has to pay for this stuff
[00:49:39.300 --> 00:49:46.660]   it's not free by the way be careful when you hack your iphone i apple is now asking for if you want
[00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:53.620]   that hundred dollar store credit to identify the phone and your phone number and they give you an
[00:49:53.620 --> 00:49:59.940]   sms text message to that at and t phone number to correct credit so if you've got a hacked phone
[00:49:59.940 --> 00:50:05.700]   you won't be getting your hundred buck credit that's clever they know what they're doing
[00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:11.940]   me as well it's very very clever that cuts into their bottom line doesn't it it does that's the
[00:50:11.940 --> 00:50:18.900]   point yeah cost some money i think well we don't know that's the speculation we think yeah people think
[00:50:18.900 --> 00:50:23.220]   i don't know the whole thing i mean you know leo how many bleeding edge phones have you bought
[00:50:23.220 --> 00:50:28.100]   for the absolute positive absolute top price and then turn around and stuff you know a few months
[00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:33.780]   later the price drop that's what amazed me like all these people like we supported the iPhone and
[00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:38.660]   and they were just the price and it's like this is a shock of these people never bought you know
[00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:43.700]   cell phones before right so well it was it was it i'm with you on that and that's kind of exactly
[00:50:43.700 --> 00:50:46.980]   what i'm saying it was an amazing drop it was a 30 percent drop it was that's the thing it's a
[00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:52.980]   huge drop exactly it's a huge drop and it was in it and it happened two months after the phone came out
[00:50:52.980 --> 00:50:58.900]   so i kind of understood it's for the money suckers hey speaking of ads and hundred dollars and you
[00:50:58.900 --> 00:51:04.500]   can tend to their store back that's great they basically get a coming and going oh yeah and who could
[00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:08.020]   go in an apple store and only spend a hundred bucks you know they're going to make a little extra on
[00:51:08.020 --> 00:51:13.700]   that on the side i'll probably buy a nano right a hundred fifty dollar nano they made money see see
[00:51:13.700 --> 00:51:18.980]   see it's a it's a pretty your thing your continuing efforts to keep apple alive and highly profitable
[00:51:18.980 --> 00:51:25.140]   you'd think i had stock or something watch my zenexan stock and get an SUV
[00:51:25.140 --> 00:51:31.220]   that would make more that would be more logical i do want to thank audible.com for supporting our
[00:51:31.220 --> 00:51:35.220]   show speaking of advertisements without them uh twit would not be possible they've supported the
[00:51:35.220 --> 00:51:40.180]   whole network and they've decided to stick around which i'm very pleased with and mostly because
[00:51:40.180 --> 00:51:44.340]   i've been an audible customer for a long long time i've i've always felt some sort of
[00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:48.500]   relationship with them so it's really nice to have them on the podcast plus we love talking about
[00:51:48.500 --> 00:51:53.780]   books you can't get you can't get any better than that keeps you sane during the commute
[00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:57.860]   it uh oh and you know when i was driving down to tech tv it would have been a very different
[00:51:57.860 --> 00:52:02.820]   Leo showed up if i hadn't had audible i can tell you that actually looked forward to getting back
[00:52:02.820 --> 00:52:06.340]   in the car because i'd be in the middle of a book and i gotta get back i can't wait
[00:52:06.340 --> 00:52:11.460]   it's exact audible.com if you want to get a free book try it out for yourself you get a credit
[00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:16.340]   toward a free book by going audible.com/twit i want to recommend a book this week that's a kind
[00:52:16.340 --> 00:52:21.380]   of an interesting topic i haven't read it yet i just downloaded it i'm really excited about it
[00:52:21.380 --> 00:52:27.460]   it's called linked the new science of networks by a guy named albert laslow barabasi
[00:52:28.580 --> 00:52:33.620]   who is a professor of physics at the university of notar dame and does research on complex networks
[00:52:33.620 --> 00:52:39.620]   now it's not just computer networks basically he says all connected systems including computer
[00:52:39.620 --> 00:52:45.620]   networks have a deep underlying order and operate according to simple but powerful rules so
[00:52:45.620 --> 00:52:51.300]   whether it's an ecosystem or an ethernet uh it's all the same he taught that book he talks about how
[00:52:51.300 --> 00:52:59.460]   google took advantage of these principles how al-kaida takes advantage of these principles
[00:52:59.460 --> 00:53:05.140]   very interesting i can't wait to read this i'm hearing very good things about it this this
[00:53:05.140 --> 00:53:10.260]   this is the google as like the first major google s-shirt box incredible concept and possible to read
[00:53:10.260 --> 00:53:14.820]   book at the 21th century it might well be it sounds fascinating yeah i'll let you know i'm about
[00:53:14.820 --> 00:53:18.660]   to read it so i'll let you know i just can't wait to read it it's called linked the new science of
[00:53:18.660 --> 00:53:26.820]   networks albert laslow b_a_r_a_ b_a_ s_i_ who is from transylvania even though he even though he lives in
[00:53:26.820 --> 00:53:30.900]   indiana he's from transylvania so there you go he must know that's beyond cool
[00:53:30.900 --> 00:53:37.300]   i would say that i might buy a two if i were from transelvania oh yes i'm from transelvania
[00:53:37.300 --> 00:53:43.300]   uh if you want to listen to this book or any of the 35 000 books they've got on audible.com

[00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:53.460]   on your computer or your ipod that works on all sorts of mp3 players portable devices even
[00:53:53.460 --> 00:53:59.060]   specialty devices uh for people for instance who are blind or uh want to listen to a cassette and
[00:53:59.060 --> 00:54:03.220]   that kind of thing and you can burn them to see these a udi b l e dot com slash
[00:54:03.220 --> 00:54:09.700]   twit for your free book we thank them so much for their support of this week in tuck and the
[00:54:09.700 --> 00:54:15.700]   entire twit network uh let's see a couple of other stories before we wrap this thing up
[00:54:15.700 --> 00:54:23.700]   verizon is now going to court saying we don't like this for auction the fcc is doing this 700
[00:54:23.700 --> 00:54:29.940]   megahertz auction remember google asked for had four open access suggestions the fcc decided to
[00:54:29.940 --> 00:54:36.580]   implement two of them verizon doesn't like the idea that whoever wins this spectrum auction
[00:54:36.580 --> 00:54:42.100]   must allow consumers to use any device and any lawful application on their networks
[00:54:43.060 --> 00:54:47.940]   right because verizon sucks verizon hates community networking pride and verizon got so
[00:54:47.940 --> 00:54:52.740]   upset that philadelphia who they didn't barely weren't consulted about not wiring started their own
[00:54:52.740 --> 00:54:57.700]   community wireless networks they started getting a legislation in place at the state level to
[00:54:57.700 --> 00:55:01.700]   prevent you know basically to make it more difficult for communities to wire themselves
[00:55:01.700 --> 00:55:10.180]   exact verizon sucks hi let's go that yeah if they say and billy bob verizon should be reading this
[00:55:10.180 --> 00:55:14.900]   billy bob says imposing any set of requirements in the competitive wireless market would reduce
[00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:18.500]   the revenue the government will receive from the spectrum auction in other words we ain't
[00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:23.300]   gonna pay for that you know and limit the introduction of new and innovative wireless services yeah
[00:55:23.300 --> 00:55:31.300]   that's bs good for google for saying yeah because go ahead oh no i was just like because you know
[00:55:31.300 --> 00:55:37.380]   the the wireless companies haven't made fantastic amounts already off of off of the wireless auctions
[00:55:37.380 --> 00:55:41.940]   and their ability to access them in unusual ways no for you know it is you've risen we want to
[00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:47.780]   monopolize they're saying they want to monopoly basically uh google i love this google's response
[00:55:47.780 --> 00:55:54.100]   to the legal action is that verizon doesn't think consumers deserve more choice than they currently
[00:55:54.100 --> 00:55:58.500]   have and that's regrettable and i i think it is regrettable for them to go to court is absolutely
[00:55:58.500 --> 00:56:03.060]   absurd i'm sure the u_s district court of appeals will overturn them obviously the federal government
[00:56:03.060 --> 00:56:08.660]   has the right to make any stipulations at once it's our spectrum ladies and gentlemen it's our
[00:56:08.660 --> 00:56:13.140]   spectrum not yours verizon well let's hope the courts do the right thing on that one
[00:56:13.140 --> 00:56:19.380]   we shall yeah i'm not entirely sure you know google is going to be the most amazing owner of
[00:56:19.380 --> 00:56:24.420]   this spectrum should they win the bid but at least they're doing some things even if they don't get
[00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:29.700]   this right at least offers the opportunity for the american systems hit better use of it they're
[00:56:29.700 --> 00:56:34.980]   making the right noises anyway you know someday we should do a show just on you know is google
[00:56:34.980 --> 00:56:40.500]   a threat or not but they make they do the right for instance you know that the new x price that
[00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:46.900]   they just announced the google lunar x-price uh there isn't that great i mean it just just little
[00:56:46.900 --> 00:56:50.820]   things like that they're gonna as they're offering a twenty dollar twenty million yeah twenty dollar
[00:56:50.820 --> 00:56:59.540]   price and twenty million dollar prize for the first uh commercial attempt to get a soft landing
[00:56:59.540 --> 00:57:05.060]   on the moon you have to go uh for 500 what is it 500 meters you have to explore for
[00:57:05.060 --> 00:57:12.500]   um and then you get and you have to send back a gigabyte of video and high risk or high def
[00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:17.060]   imagery as well isn't that great actually it's 30 million dollars and then uh and then uh
[00:57:17.060 --> 00:57:21.700]   and then it if 500 meters transmit a moon cast you have to do a moon cast back to the earth i just
[00:57:21.700 --> 00:57:26.420]   love it so awesome i hope i do you think i mean it's gonna yeah i mean look what happened to the
[00:57:26.420 --> 00:57:31.940]   with the Ansari x-prize that really did stimulate commercial uh launches isn't the parking in
[00:57:31.940 --> 00:57:36.180]   sorry folks administering this one also are they because i was just going to x-prize that
[00:57:36.180 --> 00:57:39.780]   all the other day yeah that would be great i mean they did a great job i think with the first one
[00:57:39.780 --> 00:57:44.500]   i'll just be curious to see if somebody can do this for a cost of less than 30 million dollars if
[00:57:44.500 --> 00:57:48.820]   that's possible that that will show some very very good efficiency on their part wouldn't that
[00:57:48.820 --> 00:57:54.020]   be amazing but even if not at least this defrays the cost a little bit right or it'll make nasa
[00:57:54.020 --> 00:57:57.700]   seem less relevant and they have the autumn but it next prise too oh they do what's that
[00:57:57.700 --> 00:58:04.580]   um hold on one second i went for the i was reading about it but apparently nothing
[00:58:04.580 --> 00:58:10.340]   stated my forebrain on this one um while you're doing one session while you're while you're doing
[00:58:10.340 --> 00:58:14.340]   your research once again i also mentioned that google once again on the side of the angels
[00:58:14.340 --> 00:58:18.740]   well maybe not on this one i don't know they proposed a global privacy standard now that's the
[00:58:18.740 --> 00:58:23.780]   thing people most fear about google is that they know so much about us google's saying the u.s
[00:58:23.780 --> 00:58:29.860]   privacy standard is too patchwork uh sometimes it's too too too draconian they say it's very
[00:58:29.860 --> 00:58:36.020]   difficult for any web company to operate internationally because of the wide variety of laws
[00:58:36.020 --> 00:58:43.460]   we think that the european framework is probably inappropriate as well because it really is too
[00:58:43.460 --> 00:58:49.780]   restrictive we like the asian approach they say it's moderate it balances the privacy of
[00:58:49.780 --> 00:58:54.900]   individuals with the needs of business i'll have to read the uh the asian framework but um
[00:58:54.900 --> 00:59:02.820]   i you know that's you know this is a good question is is is google here fighting for uh us or fighting
[00:59:02.820 --> 00:59:09.060]   for google probably google right or the google shareholders the shell share or
[00:59:09.060 --> 00:59:14.020]   rober's is the case maybe mak rotenberg who with epic and we should get him on and says that the uh
[00:59:14.020 --> 00:59:18.900]   the asian uh pacific privacy framework is backward looking and the weakest international framework
[00:59:18.900 --> 00:59:24.260]   for privacy protection far below what europeans require so he's not he doesn't think it's great
[00:59:24.260 --> 00:59:29.460]   but i but i think that the what they say a global standard is certainly a good idea
[00:59:29.460 --> 00:59:34.020]   maybe it shouldn't be as uh unrestricted as google wants but i certainly i think a global
[00:59:34.020 --> 00:59:39.380]   standard is a very important step forward maybe it works yeah make it easy so the uh
[00:59:39.380 --> 00:59:44.980]   oops sorry go ahead make it easier yes i just said what i had to say you may go ahead
[00:59:45.540 --> 00:59:49.940]   you've done your role these so the x price foundation they basically google sponsored the
[00:59:49.940 --> 00:59:54.980]   lunar x price that still being administered by the x price foundation and they've also started
[00:59:54.980 --> 01:00:00.340]   uh the automotive x price which is to inspire a new generation of viable super efficient vehicles
[01:00:00.340 --> 01:00:04.260]   the multi-million dollar a xp perf will be awarded to teams that win a stage race for
[01:00:04.260 --> 01:00:08.580]   playing production capable vehicles that exceed a hundred miles per gallon of movement fuel economy
[01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:14.660]   good so and if you're a teenager don't draw do your use your cell phone while you're driving that new car
[01:00:15.220 --> 01:00:21.460]   yeah because that's illegal in california now i feel bad for teenagers they don't vote so
[01:00:21.460 --> 01:00:24.980]   that they can pass a bill like this they notice they don't pass the same bill should be passed for
[01:00:24.980 --> 01:00:29.540]   all people you shouldn't be using your cell phone while you're driving or your pda or your laptop
[01:00:29.540 --> 01:00:34.260]   or your pager but because 16 and 17 year olds don't vote they could get that one through
[01:00:34.260 --> 01:00:40.740]   totally they just don't count they don't count a 13 year old i some guy nearly brought the
[01:00:40.740 --> 01:00:46.260]   off the road in a glanda wagon with a cell phone absolutely one hand here and cut across my land
[01:00:46.260 --> 01:00:50.980]   but yeah they should be legal now i've seen patrick use the cell phone while driving so well as and
[01:00:50.980 --> 01:00:54.740]   okay no i'm not saying i don't say i don't use the cell phone while driving but at least i use
[01:00:54.740 --> 01:01:00.420]   turn signals and look before i sweep across three lanes and i can't confirm that yes we were a good
[01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:08.580]   driver we've all done it but obviously is he referring to some incident that you'd like to share with
[01:01:08.580 --> 01:01:17.940]   us here oh no no no i know nothing i smile and nod will harris do you want to ask for your help
[01:01:17.940 --> 01:01:24.500]   pardon me does it do hands-free devices really helps we've no any cell phone conversations and
[01:01:24.500 --> 01:01:29.060]   vehicles well that's the problem because the truth is what's distracting is talking on the phone not
[01:01:29.060 --> 01:01:33.460]   that you're holding it to your i mean he doesn't help that you're holding it to your ear is it more
[01:01:33.460 --> 01:01:38.500]   distracting than having a conversation with someone in the car they say it is because if you're
[01:01:38.500 --> 01:01:43.380]   got someone in a passenger seat they will measure their conversation to the situation that you're
[01:01:43.380 --> 01:01:47.060]   in like if you're trying to turn across three lanes they might stop talking for 10 seconds
[01:01:47.060 --> 01:01:52.660]   whereas the person or the other end of the phone is not going to be a very exact clench the arbor
[01:01:52.660 --> 01:01:56.260]   and fear yes yeah that is effective
[01:01:56.260 --> 01:02:03.220]   or like they point out the wind field and scream we've gone an hour and that's uh that's our limit
[01:02:03.220 --> 01:02:08.340]   for today i i want to thank you all for being here Robert Heron is is uh the host the star
