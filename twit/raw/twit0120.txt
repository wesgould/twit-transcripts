[00:00:58.320 --> 00:01:00.200]   I think we should get started.
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.120]   Did I just call you Veronica Belmont?
[00:01:02.120 --> 00:01:04.200]   You did and you're not the only one who's done that recently.
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:05.040]   Which is kind of weird.
[00:01:05.040 --> 00:01:06.120]   I like that.
[00:01:06.120 --> 00:01:08.120]   Sounds like a supermarket.

[00:01:11.280 --> 00:01:16.880]   to get your $99 HDTV player, HDVD player?
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:17.880]   Not I.
[00:01:17.880 --> 00:01:20.080]   Anyway, let's say that's Veronica Belmont.
[00:01:20.080 --> 00:01:22.360]   Mahalo to Veronica.
[00:01:22.360 --> 00:01:23.120]   Hello.
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:25.560]   She is debuting this week.
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.720]   Long awaited video project for Mahalo.
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:29.720]   Yep, tomorrow.
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:32.360]   I think some people thought that you just decided not to do it.
[00:01:32.360 --> 00:01:33.640]   [ Laughter ]
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:36.400]   Well, who knew, but it takes a little while longer than I expected
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:39.280]   to get a show off the air when there's no background in video
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:41.040]   whatsoever at the company that you're going to.
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:42.200]   That's why I do audio.
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:43.480]   You kind of have to build that up.
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:44.640]   Build it from scratch.
[00:01:44.640 --> 00:01:45.160]   Mm-hmm.
[00:01:45.160 --> 00:01:47.440]   That's also Roger Chang who knows all about that.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:49.640]   He built it for scratch at dl.tv.
[00:01:49.640 --> 00:01:51.720]   He and Robert Herron host the show.
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:56.080]   Yeah, although I Patrick actually, Patrick and...
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.000]   Who's Patrick?
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.320]   Who's Patrick and who?
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:01:59.240]   Who are they?
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:00.480]   I don't know them.
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:01.480]   Should I know them?
[00:02:01.480 --> 00:02:03.760]   Well, I don't want to take credit for something I didn't do.
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:06.080]   Actually, Patrick said he might join us.
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:07.240]   So cool.
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.120]   Have you seen the new edition do it, Vince?
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:11.200]   No, have you?
[00:02:11.200 --> 00:02:12.360]   Yes.
[00:02:12.360 --> 00:02:13.320]   How is James?
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:15.200]   Is he pretty?
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.880]   Looks like every other newborn infant I've ever come across.
[00:02:17.880 --> 00:02:19.040]   Looks like lightning.
[00:02:19.040 --> 00:02:22.040]   Yeah, kind of, without the laughter.
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:24.560]   Aha, he was a funny man.
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:26.920]   No, Patrick said if he could, he would join us.
[00:02:26.920 --> 00:02:31.680]   And I said, look, no pressure, dude, because you probably haven't slept in 12 days, but
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:32.680]   you're welcome to join us.
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.160]   So he may join us.
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:36.760]   There is somebody with a baby on the line, however.
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:37.760]   Yay.

[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:41.200]   Hey, Robert.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:42.200]   Hey, how are you doing?
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.200]   Congratulations.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:44.200]   Thank you.
[00:02:44.200 --> 00:02:45.200]   How old is your baby now?
[00:02:45.200 --> 00:02:46.200]   Six weeks.
[00:02:46.200 --> 00:02:47.200]   Six weeks old.
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.200]   And what's his name?
[00:02:48.200 --> 00:02:50.200]   Like the Italian city.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.640]   Oh, that's a pretty name.
[00:02:51.640 --> 00:02:53.320]   Was that your name?
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.320]   Your name?
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.320]   No.
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:02:57.320]   Mary, Mike's Milan, Kendira.
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:00.040]   She's an English major, and that's her favorite.
[00:03:00.040 --> 00:03:03.560]   Oh, the unbearable lightness of being scobol.
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:04.560]   Yeah.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.560]   Wow.
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.560]   Plus, I was supposed to take her to Italy, and I never did.
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:09.560]   Aha.
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:11.480]   This is close.
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:12.480]   I gave you a baby.
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.040]   What do you want?
[00:03:14.040 --> 00:03:18.560]   I've spoken like a true man.
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:22.720]   Speaking of true men, Mr. Ryan Block is here, a cheddar in chief at Engadget.
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:23.720]   Hello.
[00:03:23.720 --> 00:03:26.560]   I've never, I don't think I've ever been described as a true man.
[00:03:26.560 --> 00:03:28.440]   Are you offended?
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:31.000]   No, I'm actually very proud right now.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:34.760]   We're about to get on a horse and smoke a Marlboro or something.
[00:03:34.760 --> 00:03:38.920]   We're not going to talk too much about leopard, but you did a good job on leopard coverage
[00:03:38.920 --> 00:03:39.920]   on Engadget.
[00:03:39.920 --> 00:03:42.000]   You still happy with, it's still happy with leopard?
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:44.600]   It's not without us problems, but...
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.000]   I'm starting to see little niggly things here and there that just kind of make it mean...
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   I don't like it.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.200]   Yeah, well, nothing's ever proven.
[00:03:51.200 --> 00:03:54.160]   You know, there's that phrase, "software is never made perfect."
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.160]   It's abandoned.
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.160]   Right.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.160]   And leopard is not without us problems, but it's definitely...
[00:03:57.160 --> 00:03:58.160]   No, but I love it.
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:03:59.160]   I love it.
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:00.160]   I love it.
[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:01.160]   I love it.
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:02.160]   I love it.
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:03.400]   I think it's really good, but there's just weird little airport issues and stuff that just
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:04.400]   come up, and it's just...
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:06.000]   It's like, "Come on, what's going on here?"
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:08.200]   Did you do a clean install, or did you do an upgrade?
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:09.200]   Right.
[00:04:09.200 --> 00:04:10.200]   I haven't installed.
[00:04:10.200 --> 00:04:11.560]   Should I have done an upgrade, a clean install?
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:16.440]   I actually did an upgrade, and I had few issues like Firefox not running at all.
[00:04:16.440 --> 00:04:18.080]   It would just sit there.
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:22.000]   And then I basically cloned my entire drive to an external drive.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:27.920]   I did a clean install, and it had leopard pullback on my personal and application.
[00:04:27.920 --> 00:04:28.920]   That's a bad idea.
[00:04:28.920 --> 00:04:30.160]   Everything works fine now.
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.160]   I should...
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:35.480]   Yeah, I did an upgrade just because when I'm doing this thing, I kind of have to put myself
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:39.920]   in the position of the readership and what they're most likely to be doing.
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.640]   And so it was upgrade for me and not archive and install or fresh install or anything like
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:44.640]   that.
[00:04:44.640 --> 00:04:45.640]   And I had almost no problems.
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.160]   I mean, a couple of small things with some software and compatibility has more or less
[00:04:49.160 --> 00:04:50.640]   been fixed at this point.
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.640]   Apple told me to...
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:52.640]   No, Apple told me to...
[00:04:52.640 --> 00:04:53.640]   I should do it.
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:54.640]   You know, an upgrade was okay.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:57.680]   And so I also try to figure out, most people are going to do what Apple says.
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:59.920]   And yeah, it's surprising, better than it should have.
[00:04:59.920 --> 00:05:00.920]   I mean...
[00:05:00.920 --> 00:05:02.880]   Yeah, no, the upgrade works well.
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:09.040]   It was just a few software applications that hung and then didn't want to run.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:11.720]   And so I did a clean and all those issues went away.
[00:05:11.720 --> 00:05:13.240]   Okay, enough leopard talk.
[00:05:13.240 --> 00:05:17.600]   This isn't the leopard show because there's bigger fish to fry this week.
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:19.280]   Some really big fish to fry.
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:26.760]   Starting with Google, sticking it in Facebook's face, saying, "We've got an API."
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:29.240]   Facebook says, "What?"
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:30.960]   "What?"
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:32.920]   You were at the announcement, weren't you, Robert?
[00:05:32.920 --> 00:05:33.920]   Yes, I was.
[00:05:33.920 --> 00:05:39.240]   They announced that they were joining forces with MySpace and 17 other partners.
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:40.240]   And LinkedIn.
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:46.480]   Like the numbers build Facebook-like apps, but build them for all 17 services all at one
[00:05:46.480 --> 00:05:47.480]   time.
[00:05:47.480 --> 00:05:48.480]   Yeah, so let's make this is open social.
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.880]   Let's make it clear this is not...
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:55.920]   I mean, or CUT, which is Google's little used off forgotten social network.
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:57.920]   It's used to be a brazil.
[00:05:57.920 --> 00:05:58.920]   Right, right.
[00:05:58.920 --> 00:05:59.920]   Which is weird.
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:00.920]   But everywhere else.
[00:06:00.920 --> 00:06:03.320]   Because that's because or CUT in Brazil means you're going to get it.
[00:06:03.320 --> 00:06:07.880]   I almost said the bad word, but anyway.
[00:06:07.880 --> 00:06:14.440]   So it's really more about an API than about Google saying, "I'm going to do Facebook."
[00:06:14.440 --> 00:06:15.440]   Right.
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.680]   Well, they clearly are planning something like that with Orkut.
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:25.040]   Or CUT's one of the 17 services that's going to support these widgets, basically.
[00:06:25.040 --> 00:06:27.600]   I call it the open widget platform, right?
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:29.320]   Because I can build a widget.
[00:06:29.320 --> 00:06:32.680]   Which by the way, the APIs are loosely based on iGoogle.
[00:06:32.680 --> 00:06:36.800]   So if something runs in iGoogle, you tweak it a little bit and you put it into the open
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:38.160]   social platform.
[00:06:38.160 --> 00:06:40.120]   And then it'll run on all 17.
[00:06:40.120 --> 00:06:41.960]   You have to be a JavaScript programmer?
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.880]   Yeah, it's JavaScript and HTML and the usual stuff.
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:48.120]   Nothing non-standard.
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:49.520]   Is this Brad Fitzpatrick's work?
[00:06:49.520 --> 00:06:57.160]   Yeah, he's on the team and Joe Kraus and my old boss, Vic and Dutro, was doing the press
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:06:58.160]   stuff.
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:00.160]   Do you know Kraus feel about aliens these days?
[00:07:00.160 --> 00:07:01.160]   I don't know.
[00:07:01.160 --> 00:07:02.760]   I don't talk so much.
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:05.000]   He's kind of backed off on that.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   He was an excite.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   We never talked about that.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   We could talk about that.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   We could talk about tech.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   People don't know.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.280]   He was an excite and then left excite and was big on aliens being around or something.
[00:07:14.280 --> 00:07:15.280]   Wow.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:18.400]   And it was just a little weird and he didn't work for a while.
[00:07:18.400 --> 00:07:20.120]   Like aliens as an ET.
[00:07:20.120 --> 00:07:21.120]   Yeah.
[00:07:21.120 --> 00:07:22.120]   Yeah.
[00:07:22.120 --> 00:07:23.120]   I think that's him.
[00:07:23.120 --> 00:07:25.120]   Unless I'm, I hope I'm not slandering him.
[00:07:25.120 --> 00:07:30.920]   I remember something like that but I don't know enough about that part of it.
[00:07:30.920 --> 00:07:31.920]   Google them.
[00:07:31.920 --> 00:07:32.920]   Be authoritative.
[00:07:32.920 --> 00:07:35.440]   Anyway, so he's doing, and of course, Fitzpatrick's a guided live journal.
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:36.440]   Yeah.
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:38.760]   Was swallowed by Blogger and then Blogger was swallowed by Google.
[00:07:38.760 --> 00:07:40.360]   So he's the little fish in the big belly.
[00:07:40.360 --> 00:07:43.400]   Yeah, Vic's apart is one of the 17 companies.
[00:07:43.400 --> 00:07:48.200]   Now the problem is this stuff is not completely built out yet, right?
[00:07:48.200 --> 00:07:52.400]   Some company shipped some services on Friday like Nang and Plaxeville.
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:56.640]   But my space wouldn't even tell me a launch date for their services.
[00:07:56.640 --> 00:07:58.520]   And they said probably a couple months.
[00:07:58.520 --> 00:08:02.560]   Do you think they, now is it in their interest because doesn't this really make it your data
[00:08:02.560 --> 00:08:05.280]   portable so you could go from my space to any other?
[00:08:05.280 --> 00:08:10.640]   Well, that's the next part of this, I don't know, announcement.
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:16.480]   The first part was getting the application working on all these things.
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:20.840]   That's what really they showed up on Thursday was apps running.
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:25.040]   You know, because Facebook's apps are really cool because I can see what apps you have
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:26.040]   loaded on your profile.
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:30.480]   That's the first time I've had a software platform like that where I could see what you
[00:08:30.480 --> 00:08:31.480]   have loaded.
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:33.480]   If you're my friend and I let you see it.
[00:08:33.480 --> 00:08:36.360]   Yeah, I can't see what apps you have loaded on your Macintosh.
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:37.360]   Right.
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:40.120]   But I can see what apps you have loaded on your Facebook profile.
[00:08:40.120 --> 00:08:42.200]   And that's one reason it got popular.
[00:08:42.200 --> 00:08:46.560]   In fact, I like, which is one of the companies that all jumped over and is supporting that
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:47.560]   open social thing.
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:54.280]   It got 6 million users or something, 5 million users in two weeks when Facebook first opened
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:08:55.280]   up.
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:08:56.280]   Right.
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:08:58.880]   Because everybody could see what apps were loaded on their friends' profile.
[00:08:58.880 --> 00:09:00.040]   But I like about music.
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:04.040]   So really what you cared about was sharing music with your friends.
[00:09:04.040 --> 00:09:05.040]   Yeah.
[00:09:05.040 --> 00:09:06.040]   Yeah.
[00:09:06.040 --> 00:09:08.040]   But the fact that they could, you think it's the fact that they could tell that you were
[00:09:08.040 --> 00:09:10.520]   using I like that made them want to use I like?
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:13.920]   Yes, because I could see what apps you have loaded.
[00:09:13.920 --> 00:09:14.920]   Right.
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:17.840]   I like what Ryan does, so Ryan's a cool guy.
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:18.840]   He has a bunch of collapse.
[00:09:18.840 --> 00:09:21.680]   I'm going to steal all his apps and put them on my profile.
[00:09:21.680 --> 00:09:22.680]   So I'm starchy.
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:23.680]   Thanks.
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:30.480]   I'm still trying to get my head wrapped around what Google is proposing.
[00:09:30.480 --> 00:09:34.760]   The first part of this is really an open widget platform where a developer can build
[00:09:34.760 --> 00:09:40.360]   one of those Facebook style applications and have it run on 17 different containers and
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.080]   more containers coming.
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:43.720]   Containers being my space.
[00:09:43.720 --> 00:09:48.800]   So if I'm at application to Facebook application developer, I may say, oh forget Facebook.
[00:09:48.800 --> 00:09:49.800]   That's only Facebook.
[00:09:49.800 --> 00:09:52.680]   I can write one application that's going to run on all these other guys.
[00:09:52.680 --> 00:09:55.120]   That's what Google's hoping for in reality.
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:58.640]   Most of the developers I've interviewed over the weekend said, well, we're going to build
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.680]   them twice once for Facebook and once for open.
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.520]   And Facebook has been kind of funny about this.
[00:10:03.520 --> 00:10:08.040]   They said, you know, they didn't show up and yet somebody at Facebook said, well, we want
[00:10:08.040 --> 00:10:10.040]   to be a part of it.
[00:10:10.040 --> 00:10:11.600]   They're they're open to it.
[00:10:11.600 --> 00:10:12.600]   They are.
[00:10:12.600 --> 00:10:13.600]   What do you know about?
[00:10:13.600 --> 00:10:14.600]   Say they're open to it.
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:18.640]   I mean, there's no knowing if they got into it how well or much they would, you know,
[00:10:18.640 --> 00:10:19.640]   how much muscle they would find.
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:24.080]   He's even risky for somebody like my space at Facebook because they're essentially saying
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.640]   you don't need to stay with Facebook.
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:26.640]   Well, that's the thing.
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:30.320]   I don't know if any of this is going to make people move to the various social networks
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.320]   or not.
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:34.520]   I mean, the reason that people join Facebook isn't specifically because of the apps.
[00:10:34.520 --> 00:10:38.600]   The apps are a cool benefit that they have from using that network.
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:42.400]   But having apps on say orchid isn't going to make me switch from Facebook or make me
[00:10:42.400 --> 00:10:45.360]   use Facebook any less.
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:47.080]   But your data will be portable down the road.
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:52.520]   So if that's the next part of it that we're not we're still not clear.
[00:10:52.520 --> 00:10:53.880]   This thing hasn't been specified.
[00:10:53.880 --> 00:10:54.880]   What's their intention?
[00:10:54.880 --> 00:10:55.880]   Right.
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.880]   That's their intention to let you move your data.
[00:10:57.880 --> 00:11:03.840]   You're a good from from our cut over to my face or to Facebook, you know, and move your
[00:11:03.840 --> 00:11:05.800]   data around.
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:08.680]   We haven't yet seen that system be built out.
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:11.240]   So we don't really know how well it'll work.
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:15.080]   The first part of this though is the apps and the apps will move.
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:20.960]   And apps are fairly easy to move because they're like I like is really its own web service
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:21.960]   anyway.
[00:11:21.960 --> 00:11:24.200]   They can live independently of Facebook.
[00:11:24.200 --> 00:11:25.200]   How much?
[00:11:25.200 --> 00:11:31.600]   You know, in a way, this reminds me a little bit of XFN, which was the XHTML Friends network
[00:11:31.600 --> 00:11:34.520]   and WordPress has been most vocal and support.
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:38.600]   The idea was kind of the whole internet should be your social network.
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:44.720]   And if with the proper infrastructure, it doesn't matter if you're on Facebook or MySpace.
[00:11:44.720 --> 00:11:46.080]   You'll be able to see everyone.
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:47.080]   Yeah.
[00:11:47.080 --> 00:11:49.640]   Is that you think the end game here?
[00:11:49.640 --> 00:11:52.920]   That's the that's the what they're hinting at.
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:56.800]   Again, we haven't seen it built out and we haven't seen the specs.
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:59.000]   Why Google want to do this?
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   What's the?
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.480]   Well, good to keep keep the big companies argue over developers and if developers are
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:09.480]   moving on to somebody else's platform and they definitely are with Facebook, every single
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:13.800]   startup I interview now says, oh yeah, we're building a Facebook guy.
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:14.800]   Why not?
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:15.800]   Why not?
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:19.920]   And so Google sitting there going, man, we're seeing this trend of all these developers
[00:12:19.920 --> 00:12:24.360]   moving off of the web and on to Facebook and building things for Facebook.
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:26.760]   We got a we got a worry about that, right?
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:32.520]   Because Google ain't going to get paid if everybody moves into Facebook.
[00:12:32.520 --> 00:12:35.440]   It's a it's a total play over developers.
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:41.440]   This was aimed at developers to get them to build the apps for both Facebook and open
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:44.840]   social because there's some really cool stuff like scrapple.
[00:12:44.840 --> 00:12:46.120]   I disagree with Ron.
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:50.480]   I think some people will join Facebook for some of the apps like Scrabulous.
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:51.720]   If you see I love Scrabulous.
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:52.720]   Yeah.
[00:12:52.720 --> 00:12:56.200]   If you see people playing Scrabulous, that might actually drag you into Facebook even though
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.480]   you really don't care about the rest of the Facebook.
[00:12:59.480 --> 00:13:02.880]   It depends on how you look at social networking.
[00:13:02.880 --> 00:13:03.880]   Do you look at it?
[00:13:03.880 --> 00:13:09.640]   I mean, if you already have a good set of people you know in the non-digital world that you
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:12.080]   frequently meet up with, yeah, that could be the case.
[00:13:12.080 --> 00:13:16.440]   But I mean, if you're younger and you're saying a smaller town, you meet a lot of the
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:22.440]   people that you know about online that may or may not be a hook.
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:29.680]   If you have a social networking group that skews to one particular kind of group of people
[00:13:29.680 --> 00:13:35.240]   be it like teenagers or you know, goss or whatever, you're more likely to or you know
[00:13:35.240 --> 00:13:37.040]   or some sort of like anime.
[00:13:37.040 --> 00:13:39.800]   If you're an anime, you know, you go into an anime group.
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:44.040]   You're not going to suddenly go over to like, you know, the Wall Street managers, you know,
[00:13:44.040 --> 00:13:46.840]   social networking site because there's a really cool app on it.
[00:13:46.840 --> 00:13:47.840]   Yeah.
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:53.040]   I think the grouping of apps will drag more people onto the Pacific one.
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:54.040]   I'm not.
[00:13:54.040 --> 00:13:55.840]   I speak to the value added.
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:59.800]   Yeah, Facebook today has what 50 million people and MySpace has more than 100 million
[00:13:59.800 --> 00:14:01.120]   people on it.
[00:14:01.120 --> 00:14:05.720]   And that means there's more people who aren't on those two services than are.
[00:14:05.720 --> 00:14:09.440]   And so how are you going to get dragged into one of those networks?
[00:14:09.440 --> 00:14:12.240]   It's going to be cool stuff to do on those networks.
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:14.800]   And yeah, the social network is a big part of that.
[00:14:14.800 --> 00:14:18.800]   But how are you even going to know about the apps until you're on the network?
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:19.800]   It's about people.
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:21.600]   I heard millions of people reading gadget, right?
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:24.800]   So if there's a cool gadget, you know, apps are one of the most important apps.
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:25.800]   Yeah, but you don't go for apps.
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:26.800]   You go because your friends are there.
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:27.800]   Yeah.
[00:14:27.800 --> 00:14:28.800]   Not because the apps are there.
[00:14:28.800 --> 00:14:32.720]   Well, yeah, but your friends are going to tell you, hey, join our Scratula game or
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:34.720]   join our XYZ thing or your Twitter.
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:39.520]   But if you could play the same widgets on any platform, then it becomes irrelevant.
[00:14:39.520 --> 00:14:41.160]   Yeah, and then there's no point moving.
[00:14:41.160 --> 00:14:42.160]   Right.
[00:14:42.160 --> 00:14:44.520]   If they're already developing the apps for Facebook and then suddenly similar apps start
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:48.560]   showing up on MySpace or Orchid or whatever, you're not going to just switch.
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:49.720]   It's the same stuff going on.
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:50.720]   Your friends can play.
[00:14:50.720 --> 00:14:55.120]   And now you understand why Google did this because they wanted to make sure that people
[00:14:55.120 --> 00:14:59.480]   didn't have a reason to switch from MySpace or from Orchid.
[00:14:59.480 --> 00:15:01.000]   It's at least a level playing field.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.360]   According to Eric Elden writing adventure beat, he says Facebook on Tuesday is going to announce
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:10.080]   pandemic, which is going to change.
[00:15:10.080 --> 00:15:11.080]   What?
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:12.920]   What are you laughing at?
[00:15:12.920 --> 00:15:14.920]   You like the name pandemic?
[00:15:14.920 --> 00:15:15.920]   Jeez, it's so...
[00:15:15.920 --> 00:15:16.920]   Sounds like a disease.
[00:15:16.920 --> 00:15:17.920]   It is.
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:22.920]   Oh, yeah, it's viral.
[00:15:22.920 --> 00:15:23.920]   It's viral.
[00:15:23.920 --> 00:15:26.040]   It's now, I don't really understand it.
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:30.240]   So maybe somebody who's looked at this can can you explain it, but according to Eric, it's
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:34.400]   going to remove the sponsored groups that advertisers can buy in the site.
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:38.320]   And instead we'll introduce pages that advertisers can buy, which can include interactive games
[00:15:38.320 --> 00:15:41.920]   or other applications of the advertisers choosing.
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:49.240]   And he says, people like I like and Flixster, which are very popular on Facebook, are embracing
[00:15:49.240 --> 00:15:52.320]   open social because they're worried about pandemic.
[00:15:52.320 --> 00:15:53.320]   Yeah.
[00:15:53.320 --> 00:15:57.560]   They don't want to play in this Facebook.
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:58.560]   I don't understand why.
[00:15:58.560 --> 00:16:00.600]   What does explain this to me?
[00:16:00.600 --> 00:16:01.600]   Anybody understand this?
[00:16:01.600 --> 00:16:10.320]   Well, part of it is that if you're an app developer and your total business is inside
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:11.320]   Facebook, you're having...
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:16.000]   You're having to compete with Facebook and Facebook might turn off your ability to put
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.640]   ads on the app.
[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:18.640]   Right.
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:19.640]   That's scary.
[00:16:19.640 --> 00:16:21.200]   And that's scary.
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:25.720]   And Facebook itself has some advantages over a third party developer.
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:31.360]   They can stick stuff into my new feed where the problem is with these newer companies.
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:35.600]   Now, Rocky and Slide were on the first wave of apps and they got millions of people to
[00:16:35.600 --> 00:16:36.600]   sign up.
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:42.760]   If you started a new Facebook application company today, it's going to be really hard
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:46.760]   for you to get a lot of people to try out those apps because I'm looking at Facebook
[00:16:46.760 --> 00:16:50.800]   right now and I have hundreds of apps that people have asked me to try.
[00:16:50.800 --> 00:16:53.200]   And I don't have time to try them anymore.
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:58.040]   According to Mike Harrington at TechCrunch, they're going to launch a way for a Facebook
[00:16:58.040 --> 00:17:03.080]   user to tell their friends what they buy online.
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:04.080]   Talk about...
[00:17:04.080 --> 00:17:07.600]   There's what you were talking about, not just come play Scrabble with me, but come fly
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:09.440]   to Hawaii with me.
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:12.200]   Yeah, or buy this song.
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:15.840]   In gadget, we'll find that interesting because now they could create an in gadget group where
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:18.640]   they could talk about gadgets and have a whole...
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:19.640]   Buy this VDA.
[00:17:19.640 --> 00:17:20.640]   I'm talking about...
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:21.640]   Yep.
[00:17:21.640 --> 00:17:23.640]   Well, it wouldn't be a PDA.
[00:17:23.640 --> 00:17:27.640]   Well, I'll list that I bought an iPhone, right?
[00:17:27.640 --> 00:17:28.640]   Right.
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:30.640]   That's true.
[00:17:30.640 --> 00:17:32.640]   So, but Google's business is advertising.
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:34.960]   So, it's Facebook.
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:36.400]   I guess it is, isn't it?
[00:17:36.400 --> 00:17:37.400]   Yep.
[00:17:37.400 --> 00:17:38.400]   So, is this really...
[00:17:38.400 --> 00:17:40.160]   Are we now really seeing the real face off?
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:42.120]   It's not about Google Microsoft.
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:43.880]   It's about Google Facebook.
[00:17:43.880 --> 00:17:44.880]   I think so.
[00:17:44.880 --> 00:17:49.320]   Facebook, by the way, is hiring a lot of the smartest people at Google.
[00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:53.080]   I'm seeing a lot of people who used to work at Google showing up at Facebook.
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:54.880]   Because the stock's going to be better?
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:55.880]   No.
[00:17:55.880 --> 00:17:56.880]   Yeah, the upside is much better.
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:17:58.080]   What is Google at now?
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:00.080]   Yeah, if you joined Google now...
[00:18:00.080 --> 00:18:01.080]   Yeah.
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:02.080]   $711.
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:04.800]   Well, Google can easily double.
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:06.440]   But, okay, that's doubling.
[00:18:06.440 --> 00:18:10.920]   You go over to Facebook and you get a bunch of stocks because you're a hot developer,
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:12.880]   you know, stock options.
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:14.600]   And you can make millions that way.
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:17.640]   You know, that's how a lot of these kids got rich at Google.
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:20.720]   You know, remember, they stole all the best people from Microsoft.
[00:18:20.720 --> 00:18:23.480]   That's why they opened an office up in Seattle.
[00:18:23.480 --> 00:18:24.480]   What about security?
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:27.240]   I mean, there's been a lot of talk about Facebook security.
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:31.800]   I feel fairly good about the Facebook markup language and its security.
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:34.800]   And I think one of the reasons people trust is because it's such a closed system.
[00:18:34.800 --> 00:18:35.800]   You open it up now.
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:36.800]   In fact, it didn't...
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:41.320]   According to TechCrunch, OpenSocial was hacked in 45 minutes.
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:42.320]   Yeah.
[00:18:42.320 --> 00:18:44.480]   And Facebook has been hacked over the years, too.
[00:18:44.480 --> 00:18:49.160]   In fact, the director of security over there, Chris Putnam, actually got his job by hacking
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:50.160]   Facebook.
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:51.160]   Oh, really?
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:18:52.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:56.880]   You know, that shows that Facebook's had three or four years where, you know, all the college
[00:18:56.880 --> 00:18:59.120]   kids have been banging on it.
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:01.520]   And it's been hardened over three years.
[00:19:01.520 --> 00:19:03.480]   OpenSocial hasn't been hardened.
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.440]   It hasn't ripped through that three year period.
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:06.440]   So I think...
[00:19:06.440 --> 00:19:10.560]   A guy named the Harmony guy who says, "I'm just an amateur.
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:13.680]   Put a bunch of emoticons on the...
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:17.000]   John McCray, the VP marketing of Plaxos profile."
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   Yeah.
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:21.480]   Oh, no.
[00:19:21.480 --> 00:19:24.280]   I think that makes me a little nervous.
[00:19:24.280 --> 00:19:25.720]   McCray, by the way, says he added the...
[00:19:25.720 --> 00:19:26.720]   I did it.
[00:19:26.720 --> 00:19:27.720]   I did it myself.
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:28.720]   I did it.
[00:19:28.720 --> 00:19:29.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:29.720 --> 00:19:30.720]   Well, many took it down.
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:31.720]   So...
[00:19:31.720 --> 00:19:32.720]   It was me.
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:33.720]   I did it.
[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:34.720]   Yeah.
[00:19:34.720 --> 00:19:37.720]   I think he came back later and realized, "No, it wasn't actually me."
[00:19:37.720 --> 00:19:38.720]   I did it.
[00:19:38.720 --> 00:19:39.720]   I actually...
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:40.720]   I like Plaxo.
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:41.720]   And I think this...
[00:19:41.720 --> 00:19:43.640]   Plaxo is a kind of company that could really benefit late to the party.
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:49.160]   But if you support OpenSocial, then your platform kind of is at a pier with everybody else.
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:50.160]   Absolutely.
[00:19:50.160 --> 00:19:53.600]   And that also lets you share or synchronize your contacts.
[00:19:53.600 --> 00:19:55.720]   In fact, that's why I use it for...
[00:19:55.720 --> 00:19:56.720]   Right.
[00:19:56.720 --> 00:19:59.720]   I had 2,000 contacts in Outlook and I wanted to get them outside of Outlook and put them
[00:19:59.720 --> 00:20:01.440]   in other things.
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:02.440]   And Plaxo...
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:03.440]   That's what I use it for.
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:04.440]   Only...
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:08.040]   I only know 20 people, so it's not quite as complicated as yours.
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:09.920]   That's exactly what I like about it.
[00:20:09.920 --> 00:20:14.040]   Yeah, I just wish I could hook it up to Facebook and shove them all into Facebook.
[00:20:14.040 --> 00:20:16.040]   But there's two problems with that.
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:18.400]   One, Facebook has a cap of 5,000 friends.
[00:20:18.400 --> 00:20:19.400]   Aww.
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:21.960]   You're the only guy who knows that, by the way.
[00:20:21.960 --> 00:20:23.720]   Yeah, when did you reach that one?
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:26.000]   I reached it in 8 weeks after joining Facebook.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:28.480]   It's because you add everybody.
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:29.480]   No, I...
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:30.480]   I don't add anybody.
[00:20:30.480 --> 00:20:31.880]   Yeah, I could do that.
[00:20:31.880 --> 00:20:32.880]   I don't...
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:33.880]   You add anybody.
[00:20:33.880 --> 00:20:34.880]   Yeah.
[00:20:34.880 --> 00:20:35.880]   You've got 14...
[00:20:35.880 --> 00:20:36.880]   I had everyone to Facebook too.
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:39.080]   He's got 14 fake Borats on his list.
[00:20:39.080 --> 00:20:40.080]   It's a two way...
[00:20:40.080 --> 00:20:42.360]   It's a two way medium.
[00:20:42.360 --> 00:20:45.000]   If people want to follow me, I follow them.
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:47.320]   That's the gift economy, right?
[00:20:47.320 --> 00:20:48.320]   And the second reason...
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:49.320]   You don't.
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:51.640]   How many people are on Twitter do you follow?
[00:20:51.640 --> 00:20:52.640]   7,000.
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:56.680]   Now, you don't leave that open and watch at 7,000 people's garbage.
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:57.680]   I absolutely do.
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:20:58.680]   Well, what...
[00:20:58.680 --> 00:20:59.920]   He does, you're not on there.
[00:20:59.920 --> 00:21:01.840]   You don't see him responding to everyone all day.
[00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:06.680]   In fact, I piss everybody off because I respond to too many people.
[00:21:06.680 --> 00:21:08.960]   And other people are going, "You're spamming my Twitter.
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:11.560]   All I see is 'scoval' when you shut up."
[00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:13.360]   At, at, at.
[00:21:13.360 --> 00:21:14.360]   Yeah.
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:15.360]   Yeah.
[00:21:15.360 --> 00:21:19.200]   So, I opened this Sunday Times Business section right on the front page.
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.880]   It's a man behind the Google phone.
[00:21:20.880 --> 00:21:22.560]   I guess the Google phone must be real.
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:28.200]   Andy Rubin, he was an Apple guy, went over to Google and now he's in charge of...
[00:21:28.200 --> 00:21:29.200]   What is it?
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:30.200]   What do they call it?
[00:21:30.200 --> 00:21:31.200]   He's the...
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:33.200]   Android Google OS.
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:35.000]   You know, it's funny because...
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:36.600]   Direct your mobile platforms.
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:37.600]   That's what he is.
[00:21:37.600 --> 00:21:38.600]   Right.
[00:21:38.600 --> 00:21:39.600]   It's funny the way these new cycles work.
[00:21:39.600 --> 00:21:40.600]   I mean, this is no secret.
[00:21:40.600 --> 00:21:44.000]   I mean, they acquired Android, which is his post.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   He did danger.
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   He was the co-founder of the danger who did the sidekick.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   Ah, okay.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:49.720]   You know, obviously, danger did its thing.
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:52.280]   And he left danger and found out a company called Android.
[00:21:52.280 --> 00:21:56.800]   And Android was quietly working on a mobile operating system and, you know, integrated
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:58.600]   mobile apps.
[00:21:58.600 --> 00:22:00.640]   This is something that was known.
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:02.400]   Google kind of quietly acquired them.
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.040]   I think it was in 2005.
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:08.560]   So, everybody after that pretty much assumed that Google is going to be getting into mobile
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:09.880]   OS space.
[00:22:09.880 --> 00:22:13.000]   And then we've been hearing, you know, rumors about this and confirmation.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.120]   I mean, you know, I've heard from multiple different really trustworthy inside sources
[00:22:17.120 --> 00:22:19.520]   who've actually seen it and know it's coming.
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:21.520]   And, you know, we've written about Andy Rubin.
[00:22:21.520 --> 00:22:24.360]   And it's just funny how the times, like, does this expose in?
[00:22:24.360 --> 00:22:26.000]   All of a sudden it's like, oh, huge news.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   Obviously, it's happening.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:29.640]   But, I mean, anybody who's been paying attention knows this is...
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:30.640]   There's no news there.
[00:22:30.640 --> 00:22:32.560]   I mean, this is all, you know, completely known facts.
[00:22:32.560 --> 00:22:35.000]   I'll just, in my defense, I'll say, you know, I read it.
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.720]   Of course, I read lots of rumors about this.
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:41.040]   But when the Times publishes it, it does give it some credence and weight.
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:42.520]   I mean, it's not that I don't believe you, Ryan.
[00:22:42.520 --> 00:22:44.520]   I totally believe what you're saying.
[00:22:44.520 --> 00:22:50.000]   But if all of that's insider, rumor, rumor, rumor, rumor, and then, I mean, look, at...
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:53.840]   The time, one of the things that happens, I'm sure, is the Times calls Google and says,
[00:22:53.840 --> 00:22:55.400]   is it okay if we say this?
[00:22:55.400 --> 00:22:58.760]   Well, I mean, you got to remember, when you look closely at the language and the Times,
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:01.040]   they don't confirm anything more than any of the other publications.
[00:23:01.040 --> 00:23:05.320]   Yeah, but Andy gives him an interview and a profile and pictures at his house.
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:07.880]   Yeah, but he doesn't say anything about the Google file.
[00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:08.880]   Right.
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:10.600]   So let's talk about the Google phone.
[00:23:10.600 --> 00:23:12.760]   What we know and what we don't know.
[00:23:12.760 --> 00:23:15.920]   Obviously, there's an operating system based on Android.
[00:23:15.920 --> 00:23:16.920]   Is there hardware?
[00:23:16.920 --> 00:23:20.400]   Well, I mean, that's kind of a nebulous question.
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:24.960]   When you say it's going to run on a piece of hardware, but it's Google going to sell
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:25.960]   hardware?
[00:23:25.960 --> 00:23:26.960]   Are they going to do an eight?
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:31.000]   I mean, some say HTC, some say this Chinese company is building a set form.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.360]   Is Google going to sell a set?
[00:23:32.360 --> 00:23:33.360]   Are they going to...
[00:23:33.360 --> 00:23:36.320]   Well, you got to remember, I mean, this can go so many different ways.
[00:23:36.320 --> 00:23:42.320]   They could sell their own Google branded phone through an ODM like HTC, the same way
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:46.200]   that Palm used to sell the trios that were made by HTC.
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:47.680]   And they can try to sell those to the carriers.
[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:55.600]   They can distribute the OS and let carriers or handset manufacturers kind of do the hardware
[00:23:55.600 --> 00:23:57.080]   end of things.
[00:23:57.080 --> 00:24:01.000]   Or they can maybe, if they're really crazy, they could just put the code out there, open
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.680]   source the code and let anybody who wants to have at it get onto the Google ads.
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:09.720]   I mean, everything that I've seen, everything I've heard points to them working with multiple
[00:24:09.720 --> 00:24:16.200]   carriers and handset manufacturers, basically with the goal of dumping the operating system
[00:24:16.200 --> 00:24:22.040]   on as many devices as they can possibly do it on, let them decide the interface and let
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:23.720]   them decide everything they want to put on it.
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:28.120]   Just as long as that, it's got that really great Google app integration.
[00:24:28.120 --> 00:24:32.200]   What did they learn from Apple's experience with AT&T?
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:35.360]   To not just use one carrier?
[00:24:35.360 --> 00:24:37.960]   I think not to use just one hardware design.
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:44.200]   Either I mean, as cool as the iPhone is, it's not a perfect fit for everyone.
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:45.200]   For that.
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:50.360]   Google knows that the real money here in the future is not going to be in hardware.
[00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:51.360]   It's going to be in services.
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:55.360]   It's location-based advertising, isn't that what they care most about?
[00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:59.720]   Well, there's that, but then there's also just the value out of making sure that they
[00:24:59.720 --> 00:25:04.840]   keep the users they have locked into the Google app ecosystem.
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:09.080]   They don't want to lose Google account or Google Mail, Google search users to other search
[00:25:09.080 --> 00:25:10.080]   engines.
[00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:11.080]   It's not just about advertising.
[00:25:11.080 --> 00:25:12.720]   It's about stickiness.
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:15.400]   They want to keep Google in your life and they want to remain on the top that way.
[00:25:15.400 --> 00:25:18.400]   This is an extremely effective way of doing that.
[00:25:18.400 --> 00:25:22.320]   We'll probably know in about three hours Google's supposed to make an announcement at 11 o'clock
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:24.040]   Eastern on Monday.
[00:25:24.040 --> 00:25:26.480]   Will they end up?
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:29.520]   I mean, I don't think what they're going to be doing is going to be very shocking to
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:30.520]   anyone.
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:36.280]   We may find shocking or most shocking about it is that it may not be super Google branded.
[00:25:36.280 --> 00:25:39.960]   You may not even necessarily know that you're going to be running a Google phone.
[00:25:39.960 --> 00:25:41.840]   Goss, Google OS.
[00:25:41.840 --> 00:25:42.840]   Goss.
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:43.840]   I like that.
[00:25:43.840 --> 00:25:48.040]   I think that's kind of the beauty of what they're doing is they don't want to get in
[00:25:48.040 --> 00:25:54.000]   between the handset makers and the manufacturers and the carriers.
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:55.520]   Why is Google doing this, though?
[00:25:55.520 --> 00:25:57.640]   They just want to Google sticky.
[00:25:57.640 --> 00:25:59.920]   But they're not going to sell it.
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:02.400]   They're going to give it away.
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:06.960]   Nokia could put it in their phone, not charge, not pay anything to Google, might not even
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:08.400]   branded Google.
[00:26:08.400 --> 00:26:10.000]   What does Google get out of that?
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.800]   Again, I think that they're trying to ensure that the services stay sticky with Google.
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:17.520]   So it will have a lot of Google stuff on it.
[00:26:17.520 --> 00:26:22.840]   There may be a requirement that if you use the Google, if you use Android, mobile OS,
[00:26:22.840 --> 00:26:27.440]   whatever you want to call it, you have to bundle it with Google Calendar, Google
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:29.360]   Mail, all the regular Google app support.
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:30.760]   We're going to build that into the operating system.
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:32.160]   It's going to have great integration.
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:33.720]   You can customize the interface.
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:38.200]   You can have it for free or cheap, cheaper than most other advanced operating phone operating
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:39.200]   systems out there.
[00:26:39.200 --> 00:26:41.960]   We just want to make sure that we can keep these services on there.
[00:26:41.960 --> 00:26:44.360]   I think that's probably the way they're going to be after here.
[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:46.640]   I think they're really, really smart.
[00:26:46.640 --> 00:26:48.600]   But you also think about the demographic data.
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:50.200]   They could call from that.
[00:26:50.200 --> 00:26:51.200]   I mean, they're so much like--
[00:26:51.200 --> 00:26:52.360]   Oh, it's hugely valuable.
[00:26:52.360 --> 00:26:56.520]   I mean, if you're walking down the street and the phone says, "Oh, there's a pizza hut
[00:26:56.520 --> 00:27:00.200]   next door," I'm going to go and take a left.
[00:27:00.200 --> 00:27:04.480]   The thing is, I mean, I don't think a lot of people really kind of get how powerful
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:05.480]   a play this is.
[00:27:05.480 --> 00:27:09.560]   I mean, when Google is in your pocket, that is so much different than Google being on
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:10.560]   your desktop.
[00:27:10.560 --> 00:27:15.640]   And it is effective and sticky and interesting in more ways than we can even really come up
[00:27:15.640 --> 00:27:16.640]   with right now.
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:17.640]   Well, they may also be--
[00:27:17.640 --> 00:27:18.640]   They get a good football day.
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:20.560]   They're going to be there for a long time.
[00:27:20.560 --> 00:27:21.680]   I think they alluded to this.
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:24.840]   It's also a defensive play because people are moving away from PCs.
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:29.160]   The other thing, I just read an article about Japanese buyers who are spending more of their
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:30.920]   dollars on non-PC devices.
[00:27:30.920 --> 00:27:33.880]   If people move away from PCs, they move away from Google on the desktop.
[00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:36.560]   But if it's in the phone, you're still the player.
[00:27:36.560 --> 00:27:42.840]   Yeah, I mean, the simple fact is, at the end of the day, people's base core desire for
[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:47.800]   some form of information, be it a map or what's in your calendar or whatever.
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:50.440]   Information is not something that stops at the desktop.
[00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:55.280]   And Google's job is to make information accessible to its users and try to make money off of
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:56.560]   serving up that information.
[00:27:56.560 --> 00:27:57.560]   Robert?
[00:27:57.560 --> 00:28:00.640]   So not doing a mobile phone OS is just, you know, the half?
[00:28:00.640 --> 00:28:01.800]   I think it's out of the question.
[00:28:01.800 --> 00:28:02.800]   Yeah, they have.
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:09.040]   I talk with one of the executives at Google who runs the map APIs and stuff.
[00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:12.080]   And they said they're learning a lot from the iPhone and seeing--
[00:28:12.080 --> 00:28:14.280]   About what to do or what not to do?
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:17.080]   Well, what to do-- they say the iPhone is actually--
[00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:18.080]   How people use Google?
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:20.680]   --the core usage of their services than any other device.
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:24.120]   So they're trying to learn from that.
[00:28:24.120 --> 00:28:26.040]   And I watch how Patrick uses it.
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:27.040]   He's using--
[00:28:27.040 --> 00:28:28.680]   You're a 14-year-old son.
[00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:29.680]   What's that?
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:30.680]   You're a 14-year-old son.
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:32.880]   Yeah, he knows you are on your Twitter list.
[00:28:32.880 --> 00:28:36.520]   He sits in the backseat of our car and if we want to go to dinner, he pulls up, you
[00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:39.160]   know, half moon bay restaurant and starts looking around.
[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:41.160]   Where do you want to go, dad?
[00:28:41.160 --> 00:28:44.840]   Oh, I'm going to go to the future of Mexican food tonight.
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:47.880]   I don't know how I survived so long without having Google Maps on a phone.
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:52.040]   I mean, I just never had a phone that had that capability built in even in the web sense.
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:54.800]   And so I'm really-- I don't know how to go back from that.
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:55.800]   I use it constantly.
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:28:56.800]   That's the thing.
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:00.120]   And that's probably the reason why the iPhone gets so much Google app.
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:02.360]   I mean, Google Maps-- sorry.
[00:29:02.360 --> 00:29:06.560]   Google Map usage is because it's the phone that has Google Maps built in.
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:10.320]   But what a lot of people don't know is that Google Maps is available for every other mobile
[00:29:10.320 --> 00:29:11.320]   platform.
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:12.320]   It's in Java.
[00:29:12.320 --> 00:29:13.320]   It's on Palm.
[00:29:13.320 --> 00:29:14.320]   It's on Windows Mobile.
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:15.320]   It's on my Blackberry.
[00:29:15.320 --> 00:29:16.320]   Not my Blackberry.
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:19.440]   It's 700 a year before Apple even mentioned it.
[00:29:19.440 --> 00:29:23.880]   I think it's interesting because what you're kind of saying is I think when people talk
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:29.040]   about desktops and mobile, I think as long as you have that internet web connectivity
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:33.280]   where you can pull that information that's from the cloud in the sky.
[00:29:33.280 --> 00:29:36.080]   I mean, a phone is so much more compact and convenient.
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:40.480]   I mean, that's why it's so popular in Japan because if you're constantly mobile, even
[00:29:40.480 --> 00:29:42.080]   with a laptop, it's still kind of bulky.
[00:29:42.080 --> 00:29:47.360]   But if you can pull out a soap bar sized device and then be able to pull out essentially the
[00:29:47.360 --> 00:29:49.800]   same data, that would be awesome.
[00:29:49.800 --> 00:29:55.160]   The other thing that we haven't talked yet is about the new world that's coming into the
[00:29:55.160 --> 00:29:56.160]   internet.
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:58.560]   You know, we're all used to the internet.
[00:29:58.560 --> 00:30:03.200]   I've used a computer for 20, 25 years.
[00:30:03.200 --> 00:30:08.440]   And most of who are on this phone call have used computers and all sorts of devices.
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:10.840]   But let's say you're a kid growing up in India.
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:12.280]   Have you been on a computer?
[00:30:12.280 --> 00:30:13.760]   Have you seen a computer?
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:15.520]   You might not have.
[00:30:15.520 --> 00:30:19.680]   And cell phones are going to be what you experience the internet on first.
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:24.160]   You know, a billion people are joining the internet this year on cell phones.
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:25.160]   And that's dramatic.
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:29.680]   And I think that's one reason Google is investing in it so hard because they know that the
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:33.640]   future growth of their company is going to come from places that aren't here in the
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:38.600]   United States or in Japan or Europe and are going to experience the internet for the first
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:40.440]   time on a cell phone device.
[00:30:40.440 --> 00:30:42.240]   That's a really interesting point.
[00:30:42.240 --> 00:30:43.240]   Yeah.
[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:46.840]   Sounds like as content providers, we should be aware of that as well.
[00:30:46.840 --> 00:30:48.240]   Yes, totally.
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:53.760]   Because, you know, not everyone's going to have the same sort of, you know, screen size
[00:30:53.760 --> 00:30:55.680]   or even processing speed.
[00:30:55.680 --> 00:30:57.920]   So, you know, how do you divvy up information?
[00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:00.400]   Do you make it a set font size?
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:04.600]   Do you make it, you know, do you, I mean, even some of the simple is layout.
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:05.600]   Do you go?
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:06.800]   Do you go with the traditional web layout?
[00:31:06.800 --> 00:31:09.520]   Where you got a bunch of, you know, you know, it's funny.
[00:31:09.520 --> 00:31:13.800]   My blog, I have formatted a WAP version and an iPhone version and the iPhone people complain.
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:16.760]   They say, "But we can see the full thing as a regular Safari page.
[00:31:16.760 --> 00:31:19.120]   Why do you do an iPhone page?"
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:20.120]   That was funny.
[00:31:20.120 --> 00:31:21.120]   I did the same thing.
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:27.120]   I iPhone optimized my blog for iPhone users and then iPhone users started complaining because
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:28.920]   they're like, "No, we want to see the actual real page.
[00:31:28.920 --> 00:31:31.640]   This is how I would tend to make my way to see the real web.
[00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:33.720]   That's the whole point of having the internet in your pocket.
[00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:36.880]   We don't want to see a, you know, a pared-down version of your website.
[00:31:36.880 --> 00:31:37.880]   Yeah, but it's about bandwidth.
[00:31:37.880 --> 00:31:38.880]   Yeah.
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:39.880]   So I figured.
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:45.000]   Well, I think it's, I think that's the, is the conception is that when you do a revised
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:47.840]   edition for mobile device, you're basically abridging the data.
[00:31:47.840 --> 00:31:49.320]   You're not getting the full set.
[00:31:49.320 --> 00:31:54.160]   So they feel that they're being cheated in the same way people would watch like a widescreen
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:31:57.320]   letterbox movie on a standard, television TV.
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:00.640]   They feel they're getting cheated out of the resolution, you know, run out and buy an
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:04.400]   HD TV and, you know, you'll get a few more lines on the top and bottom.
[00:32:04.400 --> 00:32:05.400]   So I think there's-
[00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:06.400]   I found it really funny.
[00:32:06.400 --> 00:32:10.800]   When Apple came out with their web apps page and it was an iPhone optimized.
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:15.400]   And I was thinking, why are they making the iPhone web apps page not iPhone optimized?
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:19.560]   And I'm realized because their whole platform is to be like, hey, we have the real internet
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:20.560]   in your pocket.
[00:32:20.560 --> 00:32:23.800]   Now I understand why Google may have went to iMap too.
[00:32:23.800 --> 00:32:28.160]   I mean, if you're building a phone platform, iMap is a much better solution.
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:29.160]   So happy.
[00:32:29.160 --> 00:32:30.160]   Yeah.
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:31.160]   Yes.
[00:32:31.160 --> 00:32:33.640]   Even not just on the iPhone, but on a, on a good phone.
[00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:38.120]   So if Apple is not on the list of partners tomorrow morning and 11 o'clock is, is Apple
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:41.880]   stock go down and Google stock go up?
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:45.160]   Does anyone actually think that Apple is going to be on the list of Google?
[00:32:45.160 --> 00:32:46.160]   I don't think so.
[00:32:46.160 --> 00:32:47.160]   Barbara Partners.
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:48.880]   I mean, Apple does its own thing.
[00:32:48.880 --> 00:32:49.880]   It's always done its own thing.
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:53.000]   And Apple doesn't really pair with other companies for these kinds of things.
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:58.440]   I mean, the only thing I can even really think of in recent history in terms of mobile pairing
[00:32:58.440 --> 00:33:03.600]   and integration was it's, you know, greatly maligned pseudo partnership with Motorola
[00:33:03.600 --> 00:33:05.600]   on the original rocker.
[00:33:05.600 --> 00:33:08.880]   And I mean, they basically, they actually kind of screwed Motorola now and it's really
[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:09.880]   abandoned it.
[00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:11.680]   They walked away from it.
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:12.680]   Well they walked away from it.
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:16.560]   But remember they, they'd been working on this phone for, I think it was a solid year
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:18.400]   and a half.
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:21.360]   And I don't know if it was because Motorola didn't, you know, put in the effort that
[00:33:21.360 --> 00:33:25.520]   Apple wanted or Apple just saw this as a stopgap as it was getting its iPhone strategy
[00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:26.520]   together.
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:32.040]   And remember, they were all set, they called all the press out in, I think it was 2005
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:34.360]   San Francisco for the rocker announcement.
[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:36.360]   We all knew it was the rocker announcement.
[00:33:36.360 --> 00:33:38.960]   And then it was the rocker announcement briefly.
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:42.480]   And then it was the iPod Nano show.
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:46.440]   And yeah, and then they put, you know, the one more thing was the Nano and basically,
[00:33:46.440 --> 00:33:50.600]   you know, if you look at the Apple page that day, the rocker was like a small link in the
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:52.880]   corner and the Nano was about to show the rocker ad.
[00:33:52.880 --> 00:33:57.560]   So Ed Zander later quoted as saying that Apple completely screwed them.
[00:33:57.560 --> 00:33:59.160]   They were never doing business with Apple again.
[00:33:59.160 --> 00:34:02.560]   And it was just an absolute debacle.
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:05.760]   So yeah, I don't think that Google is going to be working with Apple.
[00:34:05.760 --> 00:34:06.760]   According to,
[00:34:06.760 --> 00:34:08.920]   Apple sometimes, Apple sometimes reminds me of a small child that gets sick of their
[00:34:08.920 --> 00:34:10.680]   toy very quickly.
[00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:12.400]   Most Apple users are like that actually.
[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:17.680]   I think that's, it's a perfect symbiosis with its audience.
[00:34:17.680 --> 00:34:18.680]   And I'm one of them.
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:19.680]   So I can say that.
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:20.680]   You're a sucker.
[00:34:20.680 --> 00:34:23.000]   You're a potential span, you're a potential span.
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   Juan Carlos Perez writing in computer world says 30 industry heavy rates are on board
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:33.560]   for tomorrow's announcement, including Intel Qualcomm Broadcom and Vidia Sprint, T-Mobile,
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:39.000]   China Mobile, Telefonica, NTT, Dokomo, LG and HTC.
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.600]   I'm actually kind of an NVIDIA.
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:42.600]   NVIDIA.
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:46.600]   NVIDIA is really big in the mobile graphics market.
[00:34:46.600 --> 00:34:48.240]   They want to get their chips into phones.
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:49.240]   Oh, no, I know.
[00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:53.680]   But I mean, I'm wondering if they're going to try to, I mean, like they do with, on the
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:59.360]   iPhone, where you have a video player, you know, built in as part of an app.
[00:34:59.360 --> 00:35:01.760]   I mean, then have it hardware accelerated by NVIDIA.
[00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:05.600]   I tried to get Kevin Crewell, who works at NVIDIA on the hardware division on this show.
[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:08.200]   He said, well, we don't have anything to talk about in hardware.
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:09.200]   Oh, please.
[00:35:09.200 --> 00:35:15.520]   I mean, when I talk to the AMD guys, AMD slash ATI guys, they know that consumer electronics
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:18.240]   is going to be their big growth area in the future.
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:20.240]   I think either Kevin didn't know or.
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:22.480]   He's playing it though.
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:28.960]   Nokia, according to IDG, Nokia Verizon and Apple not so far on the list.
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:31.120]   Surprising not to see Nokia there, frankly.
[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:32.120]   No, why?
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:33.120]   Not at all.
[00:35:33.120 --> 00:35:34.120]   Why wouldn't Nokia want to work with them?
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:36.120]   They have a huge stake in their own operating system.
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:38.200]   They're, you know, producing their own services.
[00:35:38.200 --> 00:35:39.960]   Symbian, and that's where they are.
[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:44.200]   And they run some variant of Symbian, or, you know, their own custom code on every phone
[00:35:44.200 --> 00:35:45.200]   they make.
[00:35:45.200 --> 00:35:47.400]   I like Symbian, actually.
[00:35:47.400 --> 00:35:48.400]   It's not bad.
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:49.920]   And, you know, they're doing some interesting things with it.
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:54.120]   And when Symbian touchscreen comes out, you know, I think it's going to be very interesting
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:57.200]   to compete with what Apple's got going on on the iPhone.
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:36:02.280]   But yeah, no, not at all surprising that Microsoft and Nokia are not on the list.
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:03.280]   Yeah.
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:09.120]   Well, it's interesting because it's a very eerie parallel to the whole kind of MS-DOS
[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:14.760]   versus, you know, an Apple, Apple, Amiga, Commodore, Atari, where they all had their
[00:36:14.760 --> 00:36:18.080]   own hardware platforms running their own specific OS.
[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:23.920]   And then you had a bunch of clone manufacturers run, you know, basically Microsoft's version
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:30.160]   of the PC-DOS OS, thereby making it a lot more widespread, you know, kind of strength
[00:36:30.160 --> 00:36:34.400]   in numbers where they had, they could leverage, oh, we got, you know, several hundred million
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:39.760]   users versus, you know, a couple of million for the Atari and a few million for the Commodore
[00:36:39.760 --> 00:36:42.680]   and maybe 10 or 20 million for Apple.
[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:48.920]   I mean, I think, you know, were you, were what, what Microsoft tried to do or maybe is still
[00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:55.120]   trying to do with mobile or Windows Mobile, where you have, you know, a port or you have,
[00:36:55.120 --> 00:37:02.080]   you make develop the one OS that works on a multiple hardware vendors machines.
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:05.280]   Maybe we're facing the end of the PC era.
[00:37:05.280 --> 00:37:06.280]   We could.
[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:07.960]   I wouldn't actually cry over it either.
[00:37:07.960 --> 00:37:10.120]   I'm kind of sick of the PC as it is.
[00:37:10.120 --> 00:37:14.880]   Do you not need a computer?
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:17.880]   Can you just do all this on portable devices?
[00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:18.000]   I don't think that mobile operating systems are going to eventually overtake the test
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   off operating system.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:23.520]   I don't want to, I don't want to try to edit a video on itself.
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:25.800]   But I mean it, but I think you do it on the web.
[00:37:25.800 --> 00:37:27.440]   Wait a minute though, you can more and more.
[00:37:27.440 --> 00:37:29.440]   You're seeing these kinds of applications on the.
[00:37:29.440 --> 00:37:30.440]   Yeah, I'm sorry.
[00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:32.440]   I think it's a let's show that kind of thing.
[00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:34.440]   I think it's because of all of us.
[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:39.760]   Because, you know, this is like pie in the sky 30, 40, 50 years down the road when we've
[00:37:39.760 --> 00:37:44.360]   all got, I would 40 gigabit wireless connections to our, you know, our YMAX cell phone carrier.
[00:37:44.360 --> 00:37:49.040]   I mean, it's just not, this is not even a conversation we can even really speak realistically about
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:50.040]   for a really long time.
[00:37:50.040 --> 00:37:51.560]   The PC is still the hub then.
[00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:53.440]   It's not going anywhere, not for a long time.
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:37:55.000]   I don't know.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:59.440]   I mean, it's, it's interesting because like, you know, what you list as a video, I mean,
[00:37:59.440 --> 00:38:03.960]   for a lot of people that that's not the prime reason why they have a piece.
[00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:07.360]   You know, one of the biggest push, you know, one of the biggest growth areas where you
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:11.320]   saw a, you know, people buying PCs is when they start seeing a bunch of URLs.
[00:38:11.320 --> 00:38:15.040]   So it was the first time on a, on an advertisement or on a TV show.
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:16.040]   Oh, interesting.
[00:38:16.040 --> 00:38:19.240]   Like, hey, look, what am I, you know, they see this URL that's on the screen.
[00:38:19.240 --> 00:38:20.880]   They say, I'm missing something.
[00:38:20.880 --> 00:38:22.640]   I need to access it.
[00:38:22.640 --> 00:38:24.360]   The only way I can do it is with a PC.
[00:38:24.360 --> 00:38:28.040]   But if you can start doing that without necessarily buying, you know, even that.
[00:38:28.040 --> 00:38:29.840]   Maybe what we do is very specialized.
[00:38:29.840 --> 00:38:31.320]   Those will be specialized PCs.
[00:38:31.320 --> 00:38:35.800]   I mean, I don't think there was word processing email surf the net.
[00:38:35.800 --> 00:38:41.040]   If you could get a machine that's powerful enough to do your word processing, a web surfing
[00:38:41.040 --> 00:38:44.600]   in a phone and if you need to full size keyboard, you can get a little adapter and plug in
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:47.160]   a USB keyboard and then plug into a monitor.
[00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:48.960]   Do you still need a full size PC?
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:50.680]   We can do that just as well.
[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:51.680]   You know what I mean?
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:54.720]   It's, I think some of it is just because we've grown up with it.
[00:38:54.720 --> 00:38:58.080]   So we can't see any other way to do it besides that.
[00:38:58.080 --> 00:38:59.400]   I don't know.
[00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:00.800]   Maybe I'm just talking about my ass.
[00:39:00.800 --> 00:39:02.480]   I mean, I see what you're saying.
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:03.480]   Yeah.
[00:39:03.480 --> 00:39:05.880]   It's a, I think it's a fairly frequent kind of futurist.
[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:07.720]   You know, when is my phone going to use your mic?
[00:39:07.720 --> 00:39:12.080]   I don't think the PC will die, but I think it will eventually become a niche product
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:15.520]   used by content developers who need the extra power to need the extra load.
[00:39:15.520 --> 00:39:16.520]   I think it might be right.
[00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:18.480]   I think it might be sooner than you think.
[00:39:18.480 --> 00:39:22.840]   The iPhone, is it the invention of the year Time Magazine says so?
[00:39:22.840 --> 00:39:25.240]   Others say, but wait, it's not really an invention.
[00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:27.360]   It's just a gadget.
[00:39:27.360 --> 00:39:32.520]   In fact, I love the article, a Lev Grossman writing in the Time Magazine pretty much apologizes
[00:39:32.520 --> 00:39:33.960]   from, from the beginning.
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:35.040]   He says, stop.
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:38.440]   I mean, don't stop reading this, but stop thinking what you're about to think.
[00:39:38.440 --> 00:39:39.440]   Oh, okay.
[00:39:39.440 --> 00:39:40.440]   I'll think it for you.
[00:39:40.440 --> 00:39:41.440]   The thing is hard to type on.
[00:39:41.440 --> 00:39:42.440]   It's too slow.
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:43.440]   It's too big.
[00:39:43.440 --> 00:39:44.440]   It doesn't have instant messaging.
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:46.120]   It's too expensive or no, wait, it's too cheap.
[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:47.440]   It doesn't support my work email.
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:48.440]   It's locked to AT&T.
[00:39:48.440 --> 00:39:52.880]   Steve, Steve Jobs secretly hates puppies and all together now.
[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:56.000]   We're sick of hearing about it.
[00:39:56.000 --> 00:39:59.280]   The mainstream media knows, I know, because every time I talk about it on the radio show,
[00:39:59.280 --> 00:40:03.240]   I get the email, nobody wants to hear a thing about the iPhone anymore.
[00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:06.880]   Sick to death of it, and yet it is the invention of the year.
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:08.880]   He does give five good reasons.
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:15.040]   It's funny, the perceptions of us who are in the early wave of stuff, but you go into
[00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:17.520]   an Apple store and there's lines of people still waiting on it.
[00:40:17.520 --> 00:40:18.520]   Still looking at it.
[00:40:18.520 --> 00:40:19.520]   Still looking at it.
[00:40:19.520 --> 00:40:20.520]   It's like a cult.
[00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:21.520]   But I do hear from everyone.
[00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:25.400]   It's not a cult, my ex-white-pot one, and she hates tech.
[00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:28.320]   That's why we're not married anymore.
[00:40:28.320 --> 00:40:36.040]   It's interesting that if you look at his five reasons, the top one is the iPhone is pretty.
[00:40:36.040 --> 00:40:37.040]   I don't like that.
[00:40:37.040 --> 00:40:39.400]   It's followed by...
[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:41.960]   It's touchy-feely is reason too.
[00:40:41.960 --> 00:40:44.720]   Now when they say it's not a phone, it's a platform.
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:45.720]   Well, maybe not.
[00:40:45.720 --> 00:40:47.720]   Steve Jobs doesn't think so.
[00:40:47.720 --> 00:40:48.720]   Come in February.
[00:40:48.720 --> 00:40:50.600]   Yeah, we'll see what happens in February.
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:53.040]   That's the ghost of iPhones yet to come, which I'll grant you.
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:54.720]   It's just Generation 1.
[00:40:54.720 --> 00:40:58.240]   But that's more of an apology, not a nomination.
[00:40:58.240 --> 00:41:02.680]   He says, the one thing he says that really I think resonates is it will make other phones
[00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:04.880]   better.
[00:41:04.880 --> 00:41:09.400]   It does set the mark, set the bar, and you've got to step up.
[00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:14.880]   I sit down at the Ritz down here and watch the tours come through.
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:16.680]   People pet their iPhones.
[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:20.960]   There's something about that.
[00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:24.080]   It's a treatee, but they do pet it.
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:27.240]   I noticed they use more stuff on it.
[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:31.720]   More people are using photos on the iPhone than use them on older phones.
[00:41:31.720 --> 00:41:34.400]   I mean, I always had the best Nokia phones to give to Patrick.
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:35.720]   He never picked them up.
[00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:38.160]   He never liked them in the iPhone.
[00:41:38.160 --> 00:41:42.680]   The joke amongst my friends is that they used to never be able to get in contact with
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:44.880]   me because I wouldn't bring my cellphone with me anywhere.
[00:41:44.880 --> 00:41:49.520]   I've always had pretty good cell phones, but now I actually carry this thing with me.
[00:41:49.520 --> 00:41:52.000]   If I don't have it, I panic.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:56.120]   It definitely resonates with people in a different way than other technology has in
[00:41:56.120 --> 00:41:57.120]   the past.
[00:41:57.120 --> 00:41:58.520]   I think it's a lot more personal.
[00:41:58.520 --> 00:42:02.240]   It's a lot more intimate, but I think they buy us.
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:06.080]   It's interesting because I think a lot of what the iPhone is doing is what they originally
[00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:07.840]   envisioned for the Newton.
[00:42:07.840 --> 00:42:09.080]   If you think it like that...
[00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:11.240]   It's just a little Newton, absolutely.
[00:42:11.240 --> 00:42:12.720]   The personal digital assistant.
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:13.880]   You've got communications.
[00:42:13.880 --> 00:42:14.960]   You have web access.
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:18.760]   You can type however slowly and awkwardly into it.
[00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:21.360]   You know, if they get rid of the handwriting recognition.
[00:42:21.360 --> 00:42:22.360]   Yeah, that's right.
[00:42:22.360 --> 00:42:23.520]   They didn't try it again.
[00:42:23.520 --> 00:42:27.840]   It's tenured newer and it still doesn't do handwriting.
[00:42:27.840 --> 00:42:31.840]   I love watching all those old Newton commercials where they're sending stuff to each other
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:32.840]   and writing on it.
[00:42:32.840 --> 00:42:33.840]   They get a kick out of it.
[00:42:33.840 --> 00:42:37.160]   I actually think that's one of the things that Steve Jobs did right.
[00:42:37.160 --> 00:42:43.240]   He took features off this thing and made the features that is there work well.
[00:42:43.240 --> 00:42:51.160]   I have a brand new Nokia N95, which does 16 things that the iPhone doesn't and does video.
[00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:53.560]   It has a GPS built into it and does 3G.
[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:57.960]   But the iPhone doesn't do video or you're talking about recording video, right?
[00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:03.520]   On and on it has a 5 megapixel camera with an iPhone 2 megapixel camera on and on.
[00:43:03.520 --> 00:43:05.960]   But nothing on it thrills.
[00:43:05.960 --> 00:43:10.200]   Nothing on it makes you feel like, man, this was just done right.
[00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:14.040]   I mean, Apple does a really good job of integrating everything.
[00:43:14.040 --> 00:43:15.520]   So it feels very seamless.
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:18.640]   It doesn't feel like, you know, it was a new feature and someone tried to screw it on
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:19.640]   at the last minute.
[00:43:19.640 --> 00:43:23.080]   All I can say is every time I do a podcast and try not to mention the iPhone somehow.
[00:43:23.080 --> 00:43:25.960]   I know we're going to get yelled at again just like last time.
[00:43:25.960 --> 00:43:26.960]   I know it.
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:27.960]   I don't know.
[00:43:27.960 --> 00:43:28.960]   I don't know.
[00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:30.560]   Wait for the hate mail and 5, 4, 3.
[00:43:30.560 --> 00:43:31.560]   Coming up.
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:33.160]   There was only two stories this year.
[00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:34.160]   iPhone and Facebook.
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:35.160]   Yeah.
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:38.920]   Well, I got another Facebook story also from Time Magazine coming up in just a bit.
[00:43:38.920 --> 00:43:41.680]   Better college kids looking at more than porn.
[00:43:41.680 --> 00:43:45.880]   But first, want to thank audible.com for their support of this podcast.
[00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:46.880]   They're back.
[00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:49.480]   They're back audible.com slash twit.
[00:43:49.480 --> 00:43:51.560]   We thank them so much for their support.
[00:43:51.560 --> 00:43:53.640]   You know, I know many of you listen to audible books.
[00:43:53.640 --> 00:43:54.960]   So I have a book to pick.
[00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:59.160]   But if anybody wants to mention an audible book that they're listening to these days,
[00:43:59.160 --> 00:44:06.160]   you know, you guys on Veronica and Tom Merritt have started a new sci-fi book club online.
[00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:07.160]   sci-fi fantasy.
[00:44:07.160 --> 00:44:08.160]   Yes.
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:09.160]   And you're in.
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:10.160]   Sword and laser.
[00:44:10.160 --> 00:44:11.160]   Sword and laser.
[00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:12.160]   Sword and fantasy.
[00:44:12.160 --> 00:44:13.160]   Laser.
[00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:14.160]   Sword and laser.
[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:15.160]   Sword and laser.
[00:44:15.160 --> 00:44:16.160]   Dot com.
[00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:18.160]   And that's a light saber.
[00:44:18.160 --> 00:44:22.160]   And your first book was the Philip Pullman book.
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:23.160]   Yes.
[00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:24.160]   Which I love.
[00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:27.160]   And by the way, I listened to an audible and it's a wonderful, audible version of that.
[00:44:27.160 --> 00:44:28.160]   Yeah.
[00:44:28.160 --> 00:44:31.880]   I actually know a few people on the site that bought the audio book on audible and listened
[00:44:31.880 --> 00:44:32.880]   to it that way.
[00:44:32.880 --> 00:44:34.160]   And it's been going really well.
[00:44:34.160 --> 00:44:36.720]   We're reading the Golden Compass right now.
[00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:39.640]   That's the first book and we're voting on the second one currently as well.
[00:44:39.640 --> 00:44:40.640]   Good.
[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:43.320]   Well, if you want to read the Golden Compass without reading the Golden Compass, that could
[00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:44.320]   be your free book.
[00:44:44.320 --> 00:44:48.000]   All you got to do is go to audible.com/twit.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:52.080]   You get a credit for a free book when you sign up and the Golden Compass is a pretty good
[00:44:52.080 --> 00:44:53.080]   one.
[00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:55.280]   He's dark materials book one.
[00:44:55.280 --> 00:44:57.040]   And I think they have all of them.
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:58.040]   I loved it.
[00:44:58.040 --> 00:44:59.920]   I really loved it.
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:03.640]   It's one of the productions where it's not just a narrator.
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:04.640]   It's a full cast.
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:05.640]   Oh, cool.
[00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:09.080]   And so it's just a great way to read this book.
[00:45:09.080 --> 00:45:10.920]   Highly recommended.
[00:45:10.920 --> 00:45:13.120]   We'll make that our book pick of the week, the Golden Compass.
[00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:18.080]   And then once you read it, or actually before you finish it, go over to Sword and Laser
[00:45:18.080 --> 00:45:20.120]   and sign up.
[00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:21.880]   Because is it free?
[00:45:21.880 --> 00:45:23.160]   You just go over there and...
[00:45:23.160 --> 00:45:24.160]   Oh, of course.
[00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:25.160]   Yeah.
[00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:27.960]   We have a social network on Ning where everyone joins in on this discussion.
[00:45:27.960 --> 00:45:30.000]   So all you have to do is sign up for Ning.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:32.760]   And we have forums there and lots of topics.
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:37.000]   And then we have a main blog at swordandlaser.com where we do all the voting for future books.
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   It's so good.
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   And you found a great template.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   I love this WordPress template.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   It's very...
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   Oh, thank you.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   Thank you.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   Dark Planet.
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   So that's perfect.
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   And now you're voting for the next book.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:47.480]   And so far, Enders Game is reading.
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:49.320]   Another great read on Audible, by the way.
[00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:50.320]   So...
[00:45:50.320 --> 00:45:51.560]   Yeah, that one's in the lead right now.
[00:45:51.560 --> 00:45:52.560]   Yeah.
[00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:54.520]   Yeah, that would actually be a great book.
[00:45:54.520 --> 00:45:55.600]   Good for discussion.
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:57.200]   But I see also Philip K. Dick.
[00:45:57.200 --> 00:45:59.240]   He's coming on strong and he's always good.
[00:45:59.240 --> 00:46:02.080]   Anyway, anyway, we could talk about books all day.
[00:46:02.080 --> 00:46:06.800]   But I do want to remind you to visit audible.com/twit and get your free book.
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:08.640]   It is a great way to read.
[00:46:08.640 --> 00:46:09.640]   It's my favorite way to read.
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:14.480]   I just talked to a woman who rode across the Atlantic.
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:16.600]   Talk about crazy solo.
[00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:17.760]   Three months.
[00:46:17.760 --> 00:46:18.760]   She listened to music.
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:20.320]   She's going to do the Pacific this summer.
[00:46:20.320 --> 00:46:22.120]   And I said, "You've got to listen to audiobooks."
[00:46:22.120 --> 00:46:23.120]   She said, "Oh, I know.
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:24.120]   I'm set.
[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:25.360]   I got a bunch of them."
[00:46:25.360 --> 00:46:26.760]   That's the way to go.
[00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:28.560]   AUDIBLE.com/twit.
[00:46:28.560 --> 00:46:31.360]   We thank them for their support.
[00:46:31.360 --> 00:46:34.800]   So, of course, now I've got to find this porn story again.
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:36.800]   Is it video?
[00:46:36.800 --> 00:46:39.560]   I've got to run because of my family friends are here.
[00:46:39.560 --> 00:46:40.560]   All right.
[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:42.160]   Hey, Robert, it's great to have you.
[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:43.160]   It's an awesome show.
[00:46:43.160 --> 00:46:45.360]   The Scoble Show, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:46:45.360 --> 00:46:46.800]   What's the best place to see that?
[00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:47.800]   ScobleShow.
[00:46:47.800 --> 00:46:48.800]   ScobleShow.com?
[00:46:48.800 --> 00:46:49.800]   Yeah.
[00:46:49.800 --> 00:46:53.320]   And, of course, you can join his fan club on Twitter.
[00:46:53.320 --> 00:46:54.400]   Thank you very much.
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:56.360]   You are a Scobleizer on Twitter?
[00:46:56.360 --> 00:46:57.360]   Scobleizer.
[00:46:57.360 --> 00:47:01.080]   I do my link blog on Twitter as well as Scoble's link blog.
[00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:02.800]   I'm on Jiku.
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:04.440]   I don't know how to say that, by the way.
[00:47:04.440 --> 00:47:05.440]   Jiku.
[00:47:05.440 --> 00:47:07.280]   Now that they're Google, you better learn how to say it.
[00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:09.800]   I'm sure they'll be part of the platform.
[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:11.280]   And on Pounds.
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:14.440]   Wherever Veronica is, I'm there because I'm not there.
[00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:15.440]   That's it.
[00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:17.440]   You and Union, that other guy.
[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:19.280]   ScobleShow.com.
[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:20.880]   Robert, thank you so much.
[00:47:20.880 --> 00:47:22.360]   I'm glad you could be on the show.
[00:47:22.360 --> 00:47:23.360]   Go socialize.
[00:47:23.360 --> 00:47:24.360]   Thanks.
[00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:25.920]   And see you up in Petaloomis and some people.
[00:47:25.920 --> 00:47:26.920]   He's doing it in real life.
[00:47:26.920 --> 00:47:27.920]   I say hi to Patrick for me.
[00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:28.920]   Take care.
[00:47:28.920 --> 00:47:29.920]   Bye-bye.
[00:47:29.920 --> 00:47:31.800]   He is a real life socializer.
[00:47:31.800 --> 00:47:34.400]   I prefer to stay alone in my little cave here.
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:35.400]   That's a lot.
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:36.400]   That's creepy.
[00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:38.400]   The little twit cave.
[00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:40.400]   All alone.
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:49.960]   So among people 18 to 24 years old, the porn is only the fourth thing they do online.
[00:47:49.960 --> 00:47:50.960]   Web-based email?
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:51.960]   Yeah.
[00:47:51.960 --> 00:47:53.200]   Well, they're probably getting it.
[00:47:53.200 --> 00:47:54.200]   That's why.
[00:47:54.200 --> 00:47:56.640]   Web-based email.
[00:47:56.640 --> 00:47:58.000]   Rich engines is number two.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.640]   You know what number one is?
[00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:00.640]   Social networking.
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:01.640]   Of course.
[00:48:01.640 --> 00:48:03.520]   They'd rather be on Facebook.
[00:48:03.520 --> 00:48:05.600]   Leo, correct me if I'm wrong.
[00:48:05.600 --> 00:48:07.960]   This is what they say they're doing online.
[00:48:07.960 --> 00:48:09.400]   Ah, good point.
[00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:12.000]   Excellent point.
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   It says hit wise.
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:14.560]   Actually, hit wise is tracking it.
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:18.880]   So I think this is probably more accurate than actually asking them.
[00:48:18.880 --> 00:48:21.200]   This isn't a survey as I believe.
[00:48:21.200 --> 00:48:25.280]   I think this is actually watching the sites visited from EDU domains.
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:26.840]   You know, I'm so not surprised.
[00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:27.840]   It makes total sense.
[00:48:27.840 --> 00:48:34.360]   I'm actually giving a speech at a convention in a couple of weeks about social networking
[00:48:34.360 --> 00:48:36.480]   and it's for financial aid people.
[00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:40.560]   And they want to know how to get in touch with their contacts and with their students
[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:42.160]   that they're working with.
[00:48:42.160 --> 00:48:44.720]   And social networking is the way that they want to do that.
[00:48:44.720 --> 00:48:48.840]   So it's really interesting how even people who aren't involved in the social networking
[00:48:48.840 --> 00:48:53.840]   landscape understand that people in that age group, that is their main way of communicating
[00:48:53.840 --> 00:48:54.840]   with each other.
[00:48:54.840 --> 00:48:57.080]   And that's really the main way to get in contact with them.
[00:48:57.080 --> 00:49:01.240]   If you're trying to talk to them, I mean even email, I mean, all of us I think depend
[00:49:01.240 --> 00:49:03.920]   90% on email for communication.
[00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:08.360]   I mean above phone for me, above I am even for me, it's email.
[00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:11.920]   And then I guess social networking is really coming up there as well.
[00:49:11.920 --> 00:49:13.400]   But I don't think of it that way.
[00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:15.680]   But you know, people who are a little bit younger definitely do.
[00:49:15.680 --> 00:49:18.480]   Well, we got a pretty young panel with you and Ryan and Roger.
[00:49:18.480 --> 00:49:22.800]   I mean, I'm the old guy, but just out of curiosity, let's start with you Veronica.
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:26.200]   What social networks do you spend most time on?
[00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:28.520]   My number one is Facebook now.
[00:49:28.520 --> 00:49:29.760]   And then Twitter.
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:32.240]   And then yeah, Twitter, Facebook, Pounce.
[00:49:32.240 --> 00:49:35.040]   And then I'm on my space, but I don't really use it at all.
[00:49:35.040 --> 00:49:36.600]   I kind of hate it.
[00:49:36.600 --> 00:49:37.840]   And then that's pretty much it.
[00:49:37.840 --> 00:49:38.840]   How do you deal with it?
[00:49:38.840 --> 00:49:40.040]   I'm going to stick Flickr all those.
[00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:41.040]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:49:41.040 --> 00:49:42.040]   Go on and on.
[00:49:42.040 --> 00:49:43.040]   How do you deal with it?
[00:49:43.040 --> 00:49:44.040]   The 10,000 dollars.
[00:49:44.040 --> 00:49:45.440]   How do you deal with Pounce versus Twitter?
[00:49:45.440 --> 00:49:47.160]   I use them for different things.
[00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:48.680]   I think we've had this discussion before.
[00:49:48.680 --> 00:49:53.880]   I mean, Twitter I use is kind of a short burst way of making announcements and talking at
[00:49:53.880 --> 00:49:54.880]   people.
[00:49:54.880 --> 00:49:57.000]   Pounce I use more is a discussion kind of form.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:02.560]   If I have an idea that I want to bounce off people, I prefer to use that as a forum style,
[00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:04.400]   kind of threaded comments view.
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:06.280]   I like that aspect a lot better.
[00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:11.320]   And if I have an audio file, I want people to hear or a photo I want people to see.
[00:50:11.320 --> 00:50:14.200]   And I really like the YouTube embedding feature in Pounce as well.
[00:50:14.200 --> 00:50:15.200]   Yeah.
[00:50:15.200 --> 00:50:16.200]   How about you Ryan?
[00:50:16.200 --> 00:50:17.200]   Are you on a social network?
[00:50:17.200 --> 00:50:18.200]   Yeah, I'm on a few.
[00:50:18.200 --> 00:50:20.800]   I don't really use the very often, you know, to be totally honest.
[00:50:20.800 --> 00:50:22.520]   He just got on Facebook.
[00:50:22.520 --> 00:50:26.680]   Yeah, you know, I'd actually, you know, I'm not like unaware of Facebook or anything by
[00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:27.680]   any means.
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:31.200]   I think it's actually the media blitz on Facebook that kept me away from it for so long.
[00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:35.600]   I actually only joined up because we did an Engadget Reader event in San Francisco and
[00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:40.080]   the reader event or one of the event pages was on Facebook and so I, you know, got an
[00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:42.200]   account just so I could see what was going on there.
[00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:43.360]   Yeah, I don't really use.
[00:50:43.360 --> 00:50:47.400]   I mean, I had a Twitter or Xbox live.
[00:50:47.400 --> 00:50:49.720]   I don't know if you count Xbox live as a social network.
[00:50:49.720 --> 00:50:54.320]   I kind of do because, you know, I have friends and contacts on it and I interact with them.
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:55.320]   Yeah.
[00:50:55.320 --> 00:50:57.320]   You can link it to your MSN live.
[00:50:57.320 --> 00:50:58.720]   Yeah, I don't though.
[00:50:58.720 --> 00:51:03.600]   I don't really use messenger, but yeah, I mean, that's probably the network I spend
[00:51:03.600 --> 00:51:04.600]   the most time on.
[00:51:04.600 --> 00:51:06.200]   And what game are you playing these days?
[00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:07.880]   I've been playing a lot of Halo 3 lately.
[00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:08.880]   Yeah, it's fun.
[00:51:08.880 --> 00:51:09.880]   I like it.
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:12.680]   But, you know, I'm a big fan of a lot of different titles.
[00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:17.000]   You know, we just got a beautiful Katamari, which is great because you can play it online.
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:19.800]   And I know Veronica's rocking to Guitar Hero 3.
[00:51:19.800 --> 00:51:21.600]   You know, we haven't got ours yet.
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:22.600]   What?
[00:51:22.600 --> 00:51:24.160]   I've been going other places to play.
[00:51:24.160 --> 00:51:26.160]   I've been more out of this than usual.
[00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:27.160]   Oh, dear.
[00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:28.160]   Except going other people's have issues.
[00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:30.200]   Oh, she's going to other people's places to play.
[00:51:30.200 --> 00:51:31.200]   Uh oh.
[00:51:31.200 --> 00:51:35.120]   Yeah, you know, I mean, I don't mean to, uh, to sound like, oh, poor me and, and lament
[00:51:35.120 --> 00:51:36.120]   the whole process.
[00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:42.200]   But so, uh, not Red Octane is, uh, yeah, no, Red Octane is the company that, that does
[00:51:42.200 --> 00:51:43.200]   rock man.
[00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:44.200]   I'm sorry.
[00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:45.200]   Guitar.
[00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:46.200]   Guitar.
[00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:50.200]   I'm not confusing because the company that used to do Guitar Hero harmonics is now at
[00:51:50.200 --> 00:51:52.000]   MTV and they're doing rock man.
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:56.240]   Anyway, the people who do, uh, Guitar Hero, we're supposed to send out the review units,
[00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:59.600]   uh, last week and they've been delaying it and delaying it and I keep saying, you know,
[00:51:59.600 --> 00:52:00.600]   I'll go buy it.
[00:52:00.600 --> 00:52:01.600]   That's fine.
[00:52:01.600 --> 00:52:02.600]   Just let me know what's up.
[00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:03.600]   So I know, you know, I don't have to.
[00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:04.600]   In the stores.
[00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:05.600]   That's a guitar hero around here.
[00:52:05.600 --> 00:52:07.600]   And they keep putting it off and delaying it the last minute.
[00:52:07.600 --> 00:52:08.600]   So that's why we don't have a fear.
[00:52:08.600 --> 00:52:11.400]   Because those little plastic guitars are really useful for Halloween costumes.
[00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:12.400]   Yeah.
[00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:14.680]   I, I was going to do that as a Halloween costume.
[00:52:14.680 --> 00:52:18.480]   Actually, I was going to go as one of the, um, one of the girls from Guitar Hero, but
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:19.880]   I didn't get it together in time.
[00:52:19.880 --> 00:52:21.440]   That would have been so good.
[00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:22.440]   I know.
[00:52:22.440 --> 00:52:25.800]   Two of the girls at my daughter's high school were heart and they used their guitar hero.
[00:52:25.800 --> 00:52:26.800]   Your heart.
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:27.800]   Wow.
[00:52:27.800 --> 00:52:28.800]   Where did they pull that out of like the.
[00:52:28.800 --> 00:52:29.800]   Oh, I don't know.
[00:52:29.800 --> 00:52:33.480]   You know, teenagers these days, they're big into this old stuff.
[00:52:33.480 --> 00:52:34.480]   It's very interesting.
[00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:35.880]   They're big into the 80s.
[00:52:35.880 --> 00:52:37.520]   The 80s has made its way back.
[00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:38.520]   They have, they like.
[00:52:38.520 --> 00:52:39.520]   They have.
[00:52:39.520 --> 00:52:43.000]   It was big when I was a teenager keeps coming back around and around again.
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:47.560]   You know, vinyl go go boots will always have a place in, in today's high school.
[00:52:47.560 --> 00:52:48.560]   That's 70s.
[00:52:48.560 --> 00:52:52.720]   Oh no, but have the heart boots with the black, the black platform.
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:54.720]   You're killing me boots to go up the thighs.
[00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:55.720]   I'm sorry.
[00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:56.720]   Okay.
[00:52:56.720 --> 00:52:57.720]   I guess that's a mod thing.
[00:52:57.720 --> 00:52:59.360]   That's not really a disco thing.
[00:52:59.360 --> 00:53:00.360]   It should be 70s.
[00:53:00.360 --> 00:53:01.360]   All right.
[00:53:01.360 --> 00:53:04.440]   Uh, Roger, do you use a social network in any way?
[00:53:04.440 --> 00:53:10.080]   Uh, yeah, actually, um, it's my space and Facebook are tie at the top.
[00:53:10.080 --> 00:53:12.960]   Now, are you using it as a public figure or do you actually use it with me?
[00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:13.960]   With your friends and stuff.
[00:53:13.960 --> 00:53:18.600]   I actually, well, I use Facebook with, you know, friends that I talked to.
[00:53:18.600 --> 00:53:22.720]   And then I use my space because I like really bizarre stuff.
[00:53:22.720 --> 00:53:27.560]   So when I was looking for roller derby teams to go watch, I actually found them on my space.
[00:53:27.560 --> 00:53:32.800]   So anything that's kind of kind of a little bit, you know, left to center, I tend to use
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:33.800]   my space for.
[00:53:33.800 --> 00:53:36.120]   Have I said how much we miss you on Twitch?
[00:53:36.120 --> 00:53:41.280]   Well, well, I mean, seriously, I mean, people talk about that.
[00:53:41.280 --> 00:53:45.640]   People talk a lot about like how Facebook, LinkedIn, Pounds and stuff lets you connect
[00:53:45.640 --> 00:53:46.640]   with your friends.
[00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:50.600]   But sometimes I want to see other stuff that I don't, I'm not necessarily, you know, apart
[00:53:50.600 --> 00:53:51.600]   of the dirt.
[00:53:51.600 --> 00:53:52.600]   Yeah.
[00:53:52.600 --> 00:53:53.600]   Roller derby is awesome.
[00:53:53.600 --> 00:53:55.280]   I mean, I went to a couple of games and it's cool.
[00:53:55.280 --> 00:54:00.440]   There's things like, um, you know, comic book clubs, which is the obvious, bad start
[00:54:00.440 --> 00:54:05.360]   galactic clubs, really kind of nerdy, dorky stuff that you haven't made it into Facebook
[00:54:05.360 --> 00:54:09.160]   or, or Pounds because those are still, you know, these are my friends.
[00:54:09.160 --> 00:54:11.360]   This is just all about my friends and not necessarily.
[00:54:11.360 --> 00:54:12.360]   See, I don't know.
[00:54:12.360 --> 00:54:13.360]   I don't agree.
[00:54:13.360 --> 00:54:16.960]   I think Facebook is really a huge haven for bizarre groups and clubs.
[00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:19.120]   I mean, they find everything on there.
[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:21.040]   I can invite it to the weirdest stuff.
[00:54:21.040 --> 00:54:25.640]   I having been through Facebook looking for really bizarre and weird stuff.
[00:54:25.640 --> 00:54:26.640]   You're right.
[00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:27.960]   There's stuff there, but it is.
[00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:29.800]   You need weirder films on Facebook.
[00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:30.800]   That's what you need.
[00:54:30.800 --> 00:54:31.800]   Maybe.
[00:54:31.800 --> 00:54:35.680]   But I'm just saying like in terms, I think it's, it's a lot, it's a lot more diverse.
[00:54:35.680 --> 00:54:38.120]   My space attracts the dog crowd.
[00:54:38.120 --> 00:54:40.640]   You know, the bounty hunter types.
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:41.640]   That's who you get.
[00:54:41.640 --> 00:54:47.200]   You get people, you get people with weird sunglasses and strange things in their hair
[00:54:47.200 --> 00:54:48.880]   and you want to hear something really interesting.
[00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:50.520]   So that's so that that's creepy.
[00:54:50.520 --> 00:54:52.240]   No, apparently that's creepy.
[00:54:52.240 --> 00:54:53.240]   I didn't say creepy.
[00:54:53.240 --> 00:54:55.120]   So this is kind of weird and creepy, but also helpful.
[00:54:55.120 --> 00:55:00.600]   The other night we went out and we left a camera at a restaurant and the manager actually
[00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:05.360]   used my credit card receipt to find my name on my space and sent me a message telling
[00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:07.840]   me that we had left my camera at the restaurant.
[00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:08.840]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:55:08.840 --> 00:55:11.280]   I was like, oh, that's kind of weird, but thanks.
[00:55:11.280 --> 00:55:12.280]   It's kind of creepy.
[00:55:12.280 --> 00:55:15.800]   You know, it's really weird is that he looked at you and thought my space.
[00:55:15.800 --> 00:55:18.840]   I guess it was worth a shot.
[00:55:18.840 --> 00:55:20.080]   I mean, we are in San Francisco.
[00:55:20.080 --> 00:55:21.320]   Who isn't on my space?
[00:55:21.320 --> 00:55:22.560]   It's very interesting.
[00:55:22.560 --> 00:55:23.640]   Wow.
[00:55:23.640 --> 00:55:26.280]   And I just, I use Facebook.
[00:55:26.280 --> 00:55:28.440]   I use a Jiku and a pounce.
[00:55:28.440 --> 00:55:30.600]   I like Facebook a lot actually.
[00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:32.320]   I think I've given up on Jiku.
[00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:33.920]   Yeah, everybody gives up on Jiku.
[00:55:33.920 --> 00:55:34.920]   I don't know why.
[00:55:34.920 --> 00:55:36.920]   I feel that, but I think I kind of have to.
[00:55:36.920 --> 00:55:37.920]   I don't know.
[00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:38.920]   It's just Google bot.
[00:55:38.920 --> 00:55:40.920]   Because Google bottom, I don't know.
[00:55:40.920 --> 00:55:42.240]   I mean, it's Yuri, right?
[00:55:42.240 --> 00:55:43.720]   He's the guy here in the country.
[00:55:43.720 --> 00:55:44.720]   You're Yuri and Petri.
[00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:47.320]   Yeah, I mean, I met Yuri before and he was great.
[00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:48.320]   Oh, it's wonderful.
[00:55:48.320 --> 00:55:50.320]   I really thought this is great, but I don't know.
[00:55:50.320 --> 00:55:52.120]   It's just not doing it for me.
[00:55:52.120 --> 00:55:53.120]   You're not well.
[00:55:53.120 --> 00:55:54.720]   What can you do?
[00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:58.720]   I try to talk people into Jiku and everybody comes and they leave.
[00:55:58.720 --> 00:55:59.720]   So it's just me.
[00:55:59.720 --> 00:56:00.720]   It's just me.
[00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:02.720]   You're just not enough of a draw anymore.
[00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:03.720]   I'm the only one on Jiku.
[00:56:03.720 --> 00:56:04.720]   Sorry, dude.
[00:56:04.720 --> 00:56:05.720]   That's just me.
[00:56:05.720 --> 00:56:06.720]   I'm the only one there.
[00:56:06.720 --> 00:56:07.720]   I don't mind.
[00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:08.720]   Let's see.
[00:56:08.720 --> 00:56:09.720]   Let's see.
[00:56:09.720 --> 00:56:10.720]   Let's see.
[00:56:10.720 --> 00:56:11.720]   Other stories.
[00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:13.320]   Spammers are using strip tees to crack captures.
[00:56:13.320 --> 00:56:14.520]   I thought that was interesting.
[00:56:14.520 --> 00:56:15.520]   A virtual.
[00:56:15.520 --> 00:56:16.520]   Absolutely brilliant.
[00:56:16.520 --> 00:56:17.520]   Isn't that clever?
[00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:18.520]   It's absolutely brilliant.
[00:56:18.520 --> 00:56:23.360]   I mean, there's really no way to get, well, no way that I've heard of to have a bot self-capture
[00:56:23.360 --> 00:56:25.720]   like that, especially picture captures too.
[00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:30.240]   And I mean, if they're giving people what they want, which is apparently lady stripping,
[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:35.520]   they can get a whole whole, it's like monkeys on typewriters, you know, just all day, just
[00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:37.960]   having captures and giving them the information they need.
[00:56:37.960 --> 00:56:41.720]   So these are the weird hard to read text things that you put on blogs to prevent spam.
[00:56:41.720 --> 00:56:47.320]   So what they do is they, when a spammer wants to create an account on a ugle or gahu, they
[00:56:47.320 --> 00:56:52.480]   will go there, start the signup process, get the capture, and then interface it to this
[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:55.280]   page, Melissa, and they put it on there.
[00:56:55.280 --> 00:56:59.440]   And then some geek sitting there says, "Oh, she'll take off her shirt if I type this."
[00:56:59.440 --> 00:57:00.440]   And he types it.
[00:57:00.440 --> 00:57:04.200]   They sign up for the account and Melissa, I guess, I haven't tried it, takes off her
[00:57:04.200 --> 00:57:05.200]   shirt.
[00:57:05.200 --> 00:57:06.200]   So clever, isn't it?
[00:57:06.200 --> 00:57:10.320]   But I heard like that it's not even a real image.
[00:57:10.320 --> 00:57:15.080]   It's like an animated image that's being stripped, so it's not even like...
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:16.880]   Dude, it's on the internet.
[00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:17.880]   It's not real anyway.
[00:57:17.880 --> 00:57:23.760]   Well, I'm just saying people get turned on by it as drawing versus like a photo.
[00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:25.840]   A drawing versus a photo, okay.
[00:57:25.840 --> 00:57:27.560]   One's 2D, one's 2D.
[00:57:27.560 --> 00:57:28.560]   No.
[00:57:28.560 --> 00:57:29.560]   All right.
[00:57:29.560 --> 00:57:30.560]   Hey.
[00:57:30.560 --> 00:57:32.560]   Actually, the drawing could be 3D.
[00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:33.560]   All right.
[00:57:33.560 --> 00:57:34.560]   All right.
[00:57:34.560 --> 00:57:37.920]   YouTube and Dig unblocked in China this week.
[00:57:37.920 --> 00:57:38.920]   Not sure why.
[00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:44.480]   I'll tell you, if I wanted to suppress a population, I would make sure they couldn't see YouTube.
[00:57:44.480 --> 00:57:46.440]   I'd make sure they could see Dig, though.
[00:57:46.440 --> 00:57:50.160]   That'd make you a heat-western civilization real quick.
[00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:51.880]   Is it a central version?
[00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:52.880]   Well, it's a rational version.
[00:57:52.880 --> 00:57:53.880]   What was the rationale by unblocking Dig?
[00:57:53.880 --> 00:57:54.880]   I don't know.
[00:57:54.880 --> 00:58:00.400]   It's just because Dig represents like a web democracy in news.
[00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:05.160]   Maybe there were a lot of posts about Chinese incidents and they just automatically.
[00:58:05.160 --> 00:58:07.160]   I guess I don't.
[00:58:07.160 --> 00:58:08.160]   Well, maybe I'll unblocking it.
[00:58:08.160 --> 00:58:10.840]   They also blocked CollegeHumor.com.
[00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:11.840]   That I understand.
[00:58:11.840 --> 00:58:13.280]   I wish I could block CollegeHumor.com.
[00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:14.280]   Yeah.
[00:58:14.280 --> 00:58:17.080]   They still block Google News and Wikipedia.
[00:58:17.080 --> 00:58:20.800]   Well, maybe they're on the right path now.
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:21.800]   Maybe it's just a matter of time.
[00:58:21.800 --> 00:58:22.800]   They're probably working on it.
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:26.080]   No, I think they're just doing it because of the upcoming Olympics and they need to
[00:58:26.080 --> 00:58:28.200]   put on a better face.
[00:58:28.200 --> 00:58:30.200]   Let's allow YouTube.
[00:58:30.200 --> 00:58:31.200]   We'll allow it.
[00:58:31.200 --> 00:58:34.400]   You want those YouTube clips to get out?
[00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:40.120]   AOL and CBS have decided to dump their high def online programming.
[00:58:40.120 --> 00:58:43.200]   AOL, yeah, I'm going to excuse myself from this conversation.
[00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:44.560]   Oh, that's right.
[00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:45.560]   You work for AOL.
[00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:46.560]   No, I'm just kidding.
[00:58:46.560 --> 00:58:48.080]   I'm happy to talk.
[00:58:48.080 --> 00:58:49.080]   I love it.
[00:58:49.080 --> 00:58:50.080]   I love it.
[00:58:50.080 --> 00:58:51.080]   I love AOL.
[00:58:51.080 --> 00:58:52.080]   It's a lot of hobbies.
[00:58:52.080 --> 00:58:55.200]   Did you actually deal with AOL in any way?
[00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:56.880]   Well, what do you mean?
[00:58:56.880 --> 00:58:58.320]   I am an AOL employee.
[00:58:58.320 --> 00:58:59.320]   My new check comes.
[00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:00.320]   It says AOL on the paycheck.
[00:59:00.320 --> 00:59:02.360]   Yeah, it says AOL on the paycheck.
[00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:05.160]   My boss is an AOL programming VP.
[00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:06.160]   All right.
[00:59:06.160 --> 00:59:08.000]   So you can recuse yourself.
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:09.240]   No, no, no, I'm fine.
[00:59:09.240 --> 00:59:10.400]   Let's do this thing.
[00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:12.120]   Let's do it, man.
[00:59:12.120 --> 00:59:13.400]   Well, I just think you can justify it.
[00:59:13.400 --> 00:59:14.840]   High Q was the service, right?
[00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:16.000]   I never saw it.
[00:59:16.000 --> 00:59:17.000]   Video. AOL.com.
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:18.640]   Yeah, I used it a little bit.
[00:59:18.640 --> 00:59:19.800]   It worked out all right.
[00:59:19.800 --> 00:59:24.160]   How did work at a regular, you know, did it suck bandwidth?
[00:59:24.160 --> 00:59:25.160]   I mean, it's high def.
[00:59:25.160 --> 00:59:26.400]   How does it do that?
[00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:34.280]   Well, I think you-- well, when I used it at my parents' place, my dad has a P3 or a P4
[00:59:34.280 --> 00:59:35.280]   list.
[00:59:35.280 --> 00:59:36.280]   It worked?
[00:59:36.280 --> 00:59:37.520]   But you have to wait for it.
[00:59:37.520 --> 00:59:38.520]   Right.
[00:59:38.520 --> 00:59:39.520]   It's not--
[00:59:39.520 --> 00:59:40.520]   Windows Media Player.
[00:59:40.520 --> 00:59:45.840]   Like, I would walk away for like, you know, a while and then come back to start playing.
[00:59:45.840 --> 00:59:50.880]   It wasn't like, you know, I don't believe any on-demand online service actually works
[00:59:50.880 --> 00:59:51.880]   like on-demand.
[00:59:51.880 --> 00:59:53.600]   You just always going to be some waiting.
[00:59:53.600 --> 00:59:54.600]   Cue it up.
[00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:55.600]   Well, yeah.
[00:59:55.600 --> 00:59:56.600]   Yeah, you know, I don't know.
[00:59:56.600 --> 01:00:01.880]   I got a beta invite on Hulu and it works really well and there's no waiting.
[01:00:01.880 --> 01:00:02.880]   You like some how many?
[01:00:02.880 --> 01:00:03.880]   But it looks really good.
[01:00:03.880 --> 01:00:04.880]   It's Hulu Flash.
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:05.880]   How is Hulu doing it?
[01:00:05.880 --> 01:00:06.880]   Hulu Flash.
[01:00:06.880 --> 01:00:09.480]   This is NBC's new platform for showing the office.
[01:00:09.480 --> 01:00:11.640]   Yeah, it's in Fox.
[01:00:11.640 --> 01:00:12.640]   It looks really good.
[01:00:12.640 --> 01:00:15.920]   I mean, it's much higher resolution than almost any other web video service when you
[01:00:15.920 --> 01:00:19.080]   do a full screen, even when you're sitting really close to it.
[01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:22.680]   I wrote about this on my personal blog because it's not really gadget kind of material.
[01:00:22.680 --> 01:00:25.320]   But yeah, I mean, it looks really good.
[01:00:25.320 --> 01:00:26.320]   Surprisingly good.
[01:00:26.320 --> 01:00:27.320]   Would you?
[01:00:27.320 --> 01:00:29.920]   To see my problem is I don't want to sit in front of the computer to watch the office.
[01:00:29.920 --> 01:00:30.920]   Yeah.
[01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:31.920]   Well, I completely agree.
[01:00:31.920 --> 01:00:35.480]   And that's one of the things I wrote about is, you know, that there's still this fundamental
[01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:40.720]   disconnect that people have where, you know, your computer is for, I hate because I feel
[01:00:40.720 --> 01:00:43.120]   like it's such a cliché, you know, lean forward activity.
[01:00:43.120 --> 01:00:44.120]   It's engaging.
[01:00:44.120 --> 01:00:45.120]   It's interactive.
[01:00:45.120 --> 01:00:48.480]   And then you're lean back, you're relaxing your TV like experience you want to have on
[01:00:48.480 --> 01:00:50.000]   the couch with your TV.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:53.760]   I think if they, if they do this as a plug-in and Windows Media Center or, you know, get
[01:00:53.760 --> 01:00:58.240]   a content deal going with Apple with Apple TV, I mean, devices like that are perfect.
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:00:59.240]   Yeah.
[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:01.640]   But the whole point, the whole point for this was to get away from Apple and to get away
[01:01:01.640 --> 01:01:02.640]   from iTunes.
[01:01:02.640 --> 01:01:07.840]   Well, if, you know, if they developed a client that worked on the PS3 and Xbox 360, they
[01:01:07.840 --> 01:01:10.640]   would have something because I mean, it's already on the TV.
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:12.320]   It's got to get on the TV.
[01:01:12.320 --> 01:01:13.320]   Yeah.
[01:01:13.320 --> 01:01:14.720]   And you could do that if you had an Apple.
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:16.760]   I guess I don't think anybody bought Apple TV.
[01:01:16.760 --> 01:01:20.080]   I love my Apple TV, but I just don't think anybody bought one.
[01:01:20.080 --> 01:01:23.680]   But if you were buying these things, buying the office as I was on iTunes and playing
[01:01:23.680 --> 01:01:25.240]   on an Apple TV, it was perfect.
[01:01:25.240 --> 01:01:27.160]   It was exactly what I wanted.
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:28.160]   Right.
[01:01:28.160 --> 01:01:30.000]   And now you can get that same experience.
[01:01:30.000 --> 01:01:35.600]   You can, you know, the video, the video quality is roughly, I mean, it's not quite as high
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:38.720]   as what you would download from iTunes, but it's almost there.
[01:01:38.720 --> 01:01:43.800]   I mean, you know, I think iTunes is VGA like 640 by 480.
[01:01:43.800 --> 01:01:48.240]   The Hulu is, the Hulu experience I think is like 560 or something like that.
[01:01:48.240 --> 01:01:52.240]   But it's about, you know, I mean, it looks really good.
[01:01:52.240 --> 01:01:53.240]   It's not.
[01:01:53.240 --> 01:01:54.240]   Oh, no, I'm not saying it's not.
[01:01:54.240 --> 01:01:55.240]   I'm just saying it's the F-television.
[01:01:55.240 --> 01:01:57.040]   I don't think you're going to notice a different special.
[01:01:57.040 --> 01:02:00.080]   You know, it's funny because, you know, on iTunes, it's not super high quality either.
[01:02:00.080 --> 01:02:02.240]   And I put up with it even on a big screen TV.
[01:02:02.240 --> 01:02:06.800]   It's, you know, you just on program material like that, not movies, it's fine.
[01:02:06.800 --> 01:02:07.800]   You know, really.
[01:02:07.800 --> 01:02:11.880]   So, so here's, here's the hidden content deal that I think Hulu should make that hasn't
[01:02:11.880 --> 01:02:18.200]   really been discussed yet is Hulu should get in tight with sling who have an forthcoming
[01:02:18.200 --> 01:02:21.960]   device that we've been waiting to get our hands on for a really long time called the
[01:02:21.960 --> 01:02:22.960]   sling catcher.
[01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:27.440]   And the sling catcher is basically the Apple TV except it's a little bit more extensible
[01:02:27.440 --> 01:02:28.440]   supposedly.
[01:02:28.440 --> 01:02:29.440]   It's three months ago.
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:33.960]   It's formats and it's basically a lot better for moving video from, you know, the outside
[01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:39.720]   world and from your PC onto your TV instead of just moving video from iTunes onto your
[01:02:39.720 --> 01:02:40.720]   TV.
[01:02:40.720 --> 01:02:45.680]   And I think her sling catcher is actually a perfect venue for Hulu to get going with.
[01:02:45.680 --> 01:02:47.000]   It was supposed to be on the spring, though.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.000]   What would happen to it?
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000]   It's supposed to be on the summer.
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:52.200]   They've waited for the fall and I guess now they're probably delaying it to the winter.
[01:02:52.200 --> 01:02:53.440]   They announced it's a yes, though.
[01:02:53.440 --> 01:02:54.440]   Yeah, no, I remember it.
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:55.440]   Two months.
[01:02:55.440 --> 01:02:56.440]   Yeah.
[01:02:56.440 --> 01:02:57.440]   Yeah.
[01:02:57.440 --> 01:02:58.440]   It was pretty sweet.
[01:02:58.440 --> 01:02:59.440]   It's still pretty sweet.
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:02.520]   If it comes easy to write something down that looks sweet, it's harder to make it, I guess.
[01:03:02.520 --> 01:03:06.640]   But no, that would be the, that would be the, you know, I mean, Apple TV works for me,
[01:03:06.640 --> 01:03:08.440]   but I would love something that were more general.
[01:03:08.440 --> 01:03:11.160]   I mean, the problem with Apple TV is there's no plug in architecture there.
[01:03:11.160 --> 01:03:12.160]   Right.
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:13.720]   I mean, there is a few more to knock if nobody asks it.
[01:03:13.720 --> 01:03:14.720]   Right.
[01:03:14.720 --> 01:03:15.720]   No, I have to convert everything to Apple.
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:19.640]   And that's the other thing is like if there was a way, if there was a set top box that
[01:03:19.640 --> 01:03:26.400]   would allow you to play multiple formats natively without this conversion, transcoding process,
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:27.400]   think that would help a lot.
[01:03:27.400 --> 01:03:30.640]   I mean, think about all the different sites and sources you get your video form.
[01:03:30.640 --> 01:03:31.640]   Right.
[01:03:31.640 --> 01:03:33.520]   And that's, that's what the goal of the Sling Catcher was.
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:34.520]   Yeah.
[01:03:34.520 --> 01:03:35.520]   Or I guess I should say is.
[01:03:35.520 --> 01:03:38.440]   I mean, it's not out yet, but that's, that's the intention there is that they want to support
[01:03:38.440 --> 01:03:39.720]   as much as possible to do that.
[01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:44.600]   And there are, there are some devices out there, you know, like the neck gear entertainer and
[01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:47.040]   you know, a few of them out there that do support a lot of different formats.
[01:03:47.040 --> 01:03:50.680]   But I don't think any of them are really good enough to, you know, let's slap a lightweight
[01:03:50.680 --> 01:03:54.120]   browser on there with flash and do, you know, web, web video stuff.
[01:03:54.120 --> 01:03:58.040]   I think that's kind of where this link catcher is supposedly going to be going.
[01:03:58.040 --> 01:04:03.240]   So many of us mocked Hulu when NBC announced it and mocked NBC for moving off of iTunes,
[01:04:03.240 --> 01:04:04.240]   but you're not alone, Ryan.
[01:04:04.240 --> 01:04:06.680]   A number of people are saying, Hey, this isn't that battle.
[01:04:06.680 --> 01:04:09.400]   Malek gave it a rave review a couple of days ago.
[01:04:09.400 --> 01:04:11.840]   I see nothing bad about it.
[01:04:11.840 --> 01:04:15.920]   I mean, there are some, there are some definite problems if you're used to downloading your
[01:04:15.920 --> 01:04:16.920]   video for one.
[01:04:16.920 --> 01:04:20.960]   I mean, oh, said I've never been more wrong.
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:23.720]   I mean, that's pretty strong.
[01:04:23.720 --> 01:04:24.720]   That's pretty.
[01:04:24.720 --> 01:04:25.720]   Yeah.
[01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:26.720]   I mean, you know, when we think about these big media companies, I think we just had the
[01:04:26.720 --> 01:04:29.720]   expectation that when they're going to rule out a new product like this, it's going to
[01:04:29.720 --> 01:04:31.400]   be so ham handed.
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:36.920]   And I mean, you know, they've had such a hard time getting, getting, you know, fitting in
[01:04:36.920 --> 01:04:39.680]   the digital era in general.
[01:04:39.680 --> 01:04:45.240]   I think this one kind of proves that these guys can look at it from a different perspective.
[01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:46.920]   And I really like it.
[01:04:46.920 --> 01:04:50.600]   I do hope that they, you know, do things that they'll never going to do like add DRM free
[01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:51.600]   downloads.
[01:04:51.600 --> 01:04:55.600]   But by the time being, in terms of watching premium content on the web, I mean, it's
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:56.840]   just an amazing solution.
[01:04:56.840 --> 01:04:59.840]   My daughter will watch TV shows on the web.
[01:04:59.840 --> 01:05:02.680]   She will watch it and on the network's websites.
[01:05:02.680 --> 01:05:04.280]   She was watching Pushing Days Easy the other day.
[01:05:04.280 --> 01:05:05.480]   And I thought, what?
[01:05:05.480 --> 01:05:06.480]   But she says she's fine.
[01:05:06.480 --> 01:05:07.480]   She's comfortable doing that.
[01:05:07.480 --> 01:05:08.480]   So maybe a generational thing.
[01:05:08.480 --> 01:05:10.840]   I don't mind watching stuff in front of the laptop.
[01:05:10.840 --> 01:05:11.840]   There you go.
[01:05:11.840 --> 01:05:13.240]   It depends on what it is.
[01:05:13.240 --> 01:05:16.800]   If it's like a two hour epic, I'm definitely going to watch it.
[01:05:16.800 --> 01:05:20.640]   But if it's, if it's something 30 minutes or less, I'll watch it in front of the computer.
[01:05:20.640 --> 01:05:22.720]   When is Hulu go public?
[01:05:22.720 --> 01:05:23.720]   You know?
[01:05:23.720 --> 01:05:24.720]   Me?
[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:25.720]   I don't know.
[01:05:25.720 --> 01:05:26.720]   They don't have an invite system or anything either.
[01:05:26.720 --> 01:05:27.720]   So don't bother asking.
[01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:28.720]   I got no invite.
[01:05:28.720 --> 01:05:30.560]   You're getting a lot of people.
[01:05:30.560 --> 01:05:31.560]   Oh my God.
[01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:32.560]   You're a hulu.
[01:05:32.560 --> 01:05:33.560]   Can I invite?
[01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:34.560]   Yeah.
[01:05:34.560 --> 01:05:35.560]   Well, you can go to hulu.com and sign up and they'll get a little.
[01:05:35.560 --> 01:05:36.560]   Right.
[01:05:36.560 --> 01:05:37.560]   Exactly.
[01:05:37.560 --> 01:05:39.800]   But they'll invite you.
[01:05:39.800 --> 01:05:40.800]   You little person.
[01:05:40.800 --> 01:05:41.880]   Yeah, I don't know why they invited me.
[01:05:41.880 --> 01:05:42.880]   I didn't actually sign up.
[01:05:42.880 --> 01:05:45.760]   I don't know why they invited you for just what you just did.
[01:05:45.760 --> 01:05:47.640]   That's true.
[01:05:47.640 --> 01:05:49.120]   That's exactly why they invited you.
[01:05:49.120 --> 01:05:50.440]   They should have invited me.
[01:05:50.440 --> 01:05:52.600]   I like to talk about stuff like that all the time.
[01:05:52.600 --> 01:05:53.840]   They know I'd hate it.
[01:05:53.840 --> 01:05:54.840]   Curses.
[01:05:54.840 --> 01:05:55.840]   They're not going to invite me.
[01:05:55.840 --> 01:05:57.640]   Couple more stories will wrap things up.
[01:05:57.640 --> 01:06:01.840]   Apple security may be a little bit less secure these days.
[01:06:01.840 --> 01:06:04.360]   Antigua reporting a new OS 10 Trojan horse.
[01:06:04.360 --> 01:06:05.920]   You have to agree to download it.
[01:06:05.920 --> 01:06:06.920]   You have to agree to install it.
[01:06:06.920 --> 01:06:08.280]   You have to give them your password.
[01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:10.320]   But once you do, they can steal your passwords.
[01:06:10.320 --> 01:06:13.240]   Hey, it's a Trojan horse.
[01:06:13.240 --> 01:06:18.400]   Do you think Mac users are as gullible as Windows users or more so?
[01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:19.400]   Maybe.
[01:06:19.400 --> 01:06:20.400]   Both.
[01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:21.960]   Less and more.
[01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:25.840]   Well, the key is, of course, if don't open, don't accept it, don't open it, don't give
[01:06:25.840 --> 01:06:27.640]   it your password.
[01:06:27.640 --> 01:06:32.880]   There are also some complaints about the new firewall system in Leopard.
[01:06:32.880 --> 01:06:35.400]   It does sound like it is not as secure as it should be.
[01:06:35.400 --> 01:06:36.400]   Yeah.
[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:37.400]   That's a bad issue.
[01:06:37.400 --> 01:06:43.040]   Well, first of all, not even necessarily from this security standpoint, I just think that
[01:06:43.040 --> 01:06:44.520]   it took a really Vista-like approach.
[01:06:44.520 --> 01:06:45.520]   And that's a bad thing.
[01:06:45.520 --> 01:06:48.160]   There are a lot of things that Vista does really well.
[01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:52.160]   But the Vista firewall is not one of those things I think that is really necessarily beneficial.
[01:06:52.160 --> 01:06:56.760]   Is it because you can turn application firewall settings is in many cases a bad idea.
[01:06:56.760 --> 01:06:58.720]   Well, actually, I actually like it better.
[01:06:58.720 --> 01:07:02.440]   Well, I don't mind, you know, what I said is block everything except what I say.
[01:07:02.440 --> 01:07:05.480]   But apparently, even with that setting, it lets stuff through.
[01:07:05.480 --> 01:07:11.640]   So it's by the way, whether you like its interface or not, it's not working.
[01:07:11.640 --> 01:07:13.440]   So that's a larger issue.
[01:07:13.440 --> 01:07:18.000]   You know, the security friend that discovered this issue said my Apple is basically the
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.840]   complacent Microsoft of four years ago.
[01:07:21.840 --> 01:07:22.840]   Might be true.
[01:07:22.840 --> 01:07:24.760]   Oh, are you sleepy?
[01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:25.760]   Me?
[01:07:25.760 --> 01:07:26.760]   No.
[01:07:26.760 --> 01:07:28.400]   I heard Roger, he on an earlier than I was.
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:29.400]   Roger's been on a like crazy.
[01:07:29.400 --> 01:07:31.680]   You got up late working on DL.TV?
[01:07:31.680 --> 01:07:33.320]   What's going on here?
[01:07:33.320 --> 01:07:34.320]   I did not.
[01:07:34.320 --> 01:07:35.320]   You on what?
[01:07:35.320 --> 01:07:36.320]   I was like three times.
[01:07:36.320 --> 01:07:37.800]   Roger, we've been taping this.
[01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:39.840]   I've got bad news for you.
[01:07:39.840 --> 01:07:43.520]   Let's replay that tape.
[01:07:43.520 --> 01:07:49.360]   So Roger Chang DL TV is going strong DL.TV you and Robert doing a great job with it.
[01:07:49.360 --> 01:07:50.360]   Thank you.
[01:07:50.360 --> 01:07:54.960]   Anything coming up you'd like to plug?
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:08:00.960]   And guess what we will have a holiday guy coming up and then we actually last week we
[01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:04.280]   just had a review for hell gate London.
[01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:07.000]   But you know, if you're into those, I don't know.
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:08.000]   It's all right.
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:09.000]   Have you played crisis yet?
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:10.000]   Anybody played crisis?
[01:08:10.000 --> 01:08:11.000]   I played the demo.
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000]   Yeah.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.000]   It's pretty sweet.
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.920]   But if it was like love on the demo.
[01:08:14.920 --> 01:08:20.480]   And the cool thing is there's a hack supposedly that allows you to get around the whole DX10.
[01:08:20.480 --> 01:08:25.320]   You can enable features that are supposedly DX10 only in a DX9 XP box.
[01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:28.400]   It's like a script or something that you got to plug in.
[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:32.800]   But if you got a if you got enough CPU and video horsepower, it'll supposedly makes things
[01:08:32.800 --> 01:08:34.680]   look 10 times better.
[01:08:34.680 --> 01:08:35.680]   Interesting.
[01:08:35.680 --> 01:08:37.280]   Ryan, you played it yet?
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:39.040]   You're a gamer.
[01:08:39.040 --> 01:08:40.560]   Not so much that kind of a gamer.
[01:08:40.560 --> 01:08:42.280]   I'm more of a couple of things.
[01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:44.720]   It's how about you, Veronica?
[01:08:44.720 --> 01:08:46.560]   No, I haven't played it either.
[01:08:46.560 --> 01:08:47.560]   Oh, there you go.
[01:08:47.560 --> 01:08:48.560]   So much for that.
[01:08:48.560 --> 01:08:53.200]   Veronica, what now tell us you're you're on the Mahalo when tomorrow?
[01:08:53.200 --> 01:08:54.200]   Yes.
[01:08:54.200 --> 01:08:55.560]   Tomorrow is the premiere of the new show.
[01:08:55.560 --> 01:08:58.800]   We had a trailer that went up last week and it was very well received.
[01:08:58.800 --> 01:09:00.280]   So I'm pretty excited about it.
[01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:01.280]   What's it going to be about?
[01:09:01.280 --> 01:09:02.280]   Tell us about the show.
[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:03.640]   Oh, man, all sorts of stuff.
[01:09:03.640 --> 01:09:07.280]   Well, a lot of it's based off of how to's that we have written up on Mahalo.
[01:09:07.280 --> 01:09:11.560]   So a lot of fun stuff and then interviews with interesting people, just about topics
[01:09:11.560 --> 01:09:15.120]   of my choosing kind of stuff that I think is cool that's going on in the world that
[01:09:15.120 --> 01:09:17.880]   I want to focus on and let people know about.
[01:09:17.880 --> 01:09:20.480]   So it's right on the front page, Mahalo.com at the bottom.
[01:09:20.480 --> 01:09:25.520]   It's Mahalo Daily with Veronica Belmont or just go to daily.mahalo.com.
[01:09:25.520 --> 01:09:26.520]   Correct.
[01:09:26.520 --> 01:09:33.520]   And when can we see the grilled cheese segment?
[01:09:33.520 --> 01:09:36.120]   That's got I don't think that's going up this week.
[01:09:36.120 --> 01:09:37.120]   It might go up next week.
[01:09:37.120 --> 01:09:38.120]   Is it going to be daily?
[01:09:38.120 --> 01:09:39.120]   Yes.
[01:09:39.120 --> 01:09:41.120]   Well, it's going to be like the daily show four days a week.
[01:09:41.120 --> 01:09:42.120]   Wow.
[01:09:42.120 --> 01:09:43.120]   So it's going to be daily for four days.
[01:09:43.120 --> 01:09:44.120]   Exactly.
[01:09:44.120 --> 01:09:45.120]   Yes.
[01:09:45.120 --> 01:09:46.120]   Monday through Thursday starting out.
[01:09:46.120 --> 01:09:56.000]   There's going to be a name for that four days a week thing.
[01:09:56.000 --> 01:09:57.000]   The other day.
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:09:58.000]   No, it's not.
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:09:59.000]   It's not.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:00.000]   It's four days a week.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:01.920]   It's a long weekend version.
[01:10:01.920 --> 01:10:05.320]   We're going to go up to five days a week soon, but we just wanted to get it rolling
[01:10:05.320 --> 01:10:06.320]   for five days a week.
[01:10:06.320 --> 01:10:07.960]   No, you don't think so.
[01:10:07.960 --> 01:10:09.960]   No, enjoy your weekends.
[01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:11.320]   I like how you think.
[01:10:11.320 --> 01:10:12.320]   Yeah.
[01:10:12.320 --> 01:10:13.880]   No, four days a week's plenty.
[01:10:13.880 --> 01:10:15.680]   Ryan Block is at Engadget.
[01:10:15.680 --> 01:10:17.680]   E-N-G-A-D-G-E-T.com.
[01:10:17.680 --> 01:10:19.200]   That's the best place to get your gadget news.
[01:10:19.200 --> 01:10:22.480]   I don't even read that other site anymore.
[01:10:22.480 --> 01:10:23.480]   There are no other sites.
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:24.480]   There's no other site.
[01:10:24.480 --> 01:10:25.480]   Did I say that?
[01:10:25.480 --> 01:10:27.480]   No, I appreciate it.
[01:10:27.480 --> 01:10:28.480]   It's a great place.
[01:10:28.480 --> 01:10:29.480]   Great kind coming from it.
[01:10:29.480 --> 01:10:30.480]   Yeah, not just gadgets.

[01:10:32.080 --> 01:10:33.080]   Lots of great stuff.
[01:10:33.080 --> 01:10:36.280]   Yeah, if it has anything to do with consumer electronics, we're probably going to be covering
[01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:37.280]   it.
[01:10:37.280 --> 01:10:39.360]   And I'm sure they'll be coverage of the big Google announcement.
[01:10:39.360 --> 01:10:40.360]   11 AM Eastern.
[01:10:40.360 --> 01:10:43.480]   I bet your little petite on it.
[01:10:43.480 --> 01:10:49.240]   Well, I don't choose to bet my petite these days, but if I were, I would.
[01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:50.560]   Trying to keep a PG here for you.
[01:10:50.560 --> 01:10:54.480]   By the way, I will be speaking at Blog World doing the keynote on podcasting that's coming
[01:10:54.480 --> 01:10:58.040]   up in Las Vegas.

[01:11:09.280 --> 01:11:13.640]   And they're giving away there the WebLog Awards, the 2007 WebLog Awards.
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:16.640]   And this show is nominated in the podcast category.
[01:11:16.640 --> 01:11:21.640]   And I surely would appreciate a vote because, well, poor John, you know, he never wins
[01:11:21.640 --> 01:11:22.640]   anything.
[01:11:22.640 --> 01:11:23.640]   Go.

[01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:11.160]   Too much work.
[01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:12.160]   The problem is, there's no limit.
