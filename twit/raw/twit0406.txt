[00:02:24.500 --> 00:02:29.000]   So fortunately we have a gigantic panel of wonderful
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.100]   people to talk about the week that was starting with
[00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:34.500]   Om Malek of Gig Aome.
[00:02:34.500 --> 00:02:36.100]   Good to see you again Om.
[00:02:36.100 --> 00:02:37.300]   Good to be back.
[00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.200]   Saw you at Google I/O is such a fun thing to run into you.
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:42.200]   You're doing great stuff.
[00:02:42.200 --> 00:02:43.400]   Well, so are you.
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.900]   Yeah, we're just--
[00:02:44.900 --> 00:02:48.800]   Especially with your new vaud belonging effort.
[00:02:48.800 --> 00:02:50.100]   Yeah, you've seen Leo Poops.
[00:02:50.100 --> 00:02:50.700]   Do you like it?
[00:02:50.700 --> 00:02:52.300]   I'm all for it.
[00:02:52.300 --> 00:02:54.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:02:54.300 --> 00:02:58.100]   I think like we're launching it on Monday.
[00:02:58.100 --> 00:02:59.000]   It's pretty exciting.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:00.700]   Om see in the first episode.
[00:03:00.700 --> 00:03:04.500]   I'll be paying money for that.
[00:03:04.500 --> 00:03:08.800]   Well, you know, actually you're in a way you're an
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.200]   inspiration because you do a paywall, paywall content,
[00:03:12.200 --> 00:03:12.500]   don't you?
[00:03:12.500 --> 00:03:13.900]   And it's doing quite well.
[00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:19.100]   It is thanks to people who actually support people like us.
[00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:20.900]   So thank you everyone.
[00:03:20.900 --> 00:03:22.900]   And what is the name of that?
[00:03:22.900 --> 00:03:24.700]   It's called Gig Aome Research.
[00:03:24.700 --> 00:03:26.900]   Not very creative, but--
[00:03:26.900 --> 00:03:29.500]   I always figured that the best--
[00:03:29.500 --> 00:03:31.500]   if you're going to do a paywall, people will pay for
[00:03:31.500 --> 00:03:33.500]   stuff like-- that makes the money, like the Wall Street
[00:03:33.500 --> 00:03:35.500]   Journal and this.
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:38.600]   I think you help people succeed and they will spend money
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:39.300]   on what you do.
[00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:39.800]   Exactly.
[00:03:39.800 --> 00:03:40.600]   It's as simple as that.
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:42.600]   Exactly.
[00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.000]   And it's pro.-- is it pro.gigahome.com?
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.300]   Is that the place to go?
[00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:47.900]   Yes, sir.
[00:03:47.900 --> 00:03:48.600]   That it is.
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.100]   Gig Aome Pro for the professional.
[00:03:52.100 --> 00:03:54.900]   Also here from New Zealand and we're so glad to have him.
[00:03:54.900 --> 00:03:56.800]   He did an amazing photo walk last night.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:03:57.900]   We'll talk about it in a bit.
[00:03:57.900 --> 00:04:01.800]   Trey Radcliffe wearing his glass and now do you have
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:04.400]   different shades of glass that you change for the--
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:05.400]   to match the t-shirt?
[00:04:05.400 --> 00:04:07.400]   Well, no, that would be ridiculous.
[00:04:07.400 --> 00:04:10.500]   So you got the-- you got the baby blue glass.
[00:04:10.500 --> 00:04:12.400]   They probably call it something like sky blue.
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:12.900]   Yeah.
[00:04:12.900 --> 00:04:15.200]   Well, you know, it's actually-- I figure you might as well
[00:04:15.200 --> 00:04:17.200]   go with a strong color and just own it.
[00:04:17.200 --> 00:04:18.000]   I think you're right.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:18.500]   Yeah.
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.100]   Don't try to pretend you don't have a big blob on your face.
[00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:21.600]   Yeah.
[00:04:21.600 --> 00:04:22.100]   Yeah.
[00:04:22.100 --> 00:04:23.800]   Just get out there with it and don't be afraid.
[00:04:23.800 --> 00:04:25.700]   So plus, I think it's kind of a pretty color.
[00:04:25.700 --> 00:04:28.100]   So many people get the beige or gray or whatever the blend
[00:04:28.100 --> 00:04:28.600]   color is.
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:29.300]   You know, I think you're right.
[00:04:29.300 --> 00:04:32.300]   When I get glass someday, I think I'm going to get orange,
[00:04:32.300 --> 00:04:33.700]   safety orange or something like that.
[00:04:33.700 --> 00:04:36.800]   Well, I bet, you know, I don't think it's-- it's that bulky.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:39.500]   But I think when it goes to market, it'll be much thinner.
[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.200]   I'm going back on this like, oh my gosh.
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:41.700]   Right.
[00:04:41.700 --> 00:04:42.700]   That looked ridiculous.
[00:04:42.700 --> 00:04:43.700]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:45.100]   Well, I think we're a long way from market.
[00:04:45.100 --> 00:04:46.000]   We'll talk about that.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.100]   One of the things you're doing, which is so cool,
[00:04:49.100 --> 00:04:50.700]   is virtual photo walks.
[00:04:50.700 --> 00:04:52.700]   You did one last night in San Francisco,
[00:04:52.700 --> 00:04:55.300]   where not only do people come in real, you know, meet space
[00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:58.000]   and take pictures with you of the San Francisco skyline.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:04:58.500]   And I knew it.
[00:04:58.500 --> 00:04:59.700]   So many great people with you.
[00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:03.200]   But people can watch through your glasses at home.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:05.260]   Well, there's a wonderful organization
[00:05:05.260 --> 00:05:07.400]   called Virtual Photo Walks.
[00:05:07.400 --> 00:05:10.300]   And their tagline is to know, to care, to act.
[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.000]   And it's walking the walk for those that can't.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:13.800]   So there's a lot of people that love photography,
[00:05:13.800 --> 00:05:16.100]   but they just lost the ability to walk around,
[00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.100]   like a lot of the rest of us.
[00:05:18.100 --> 00:05:22.500]   And so we do these live broadcasts.
[00:05:22.500 --> 00:05:24.100]   We can go through glass.
[00:05:24.100 --> 00:05:27.900]   This particular one, I had the help of the great Karen Hutton.
[00:05:27.900 --> 00:05:30.900]   She walked around with a little doodad,
[00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.700]   and she was able to broadcast live.
[00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:34.600]   So it was really me and Thomas Hawk.
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:36.900]   We did this together, sort of a team.
[00:05:36.900 --> 00:05:39.300]   And it was the night before I owe it was the last night.
[00:05:39.300 --> 00:05:40.500]   But yeah, it was amazing.
[00:05:40.500 --> 00:05:42.500]   We had over 400 people came out.
[00:05:42.500 --> 00:05:44.100]   Like physical people came out.
[00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:47.500]   And then we were able to broadcast live all over the internet
[00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.840]   to all the people that weren't there.
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:50.240]   And we put on headsets.
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.400]   They can ask us questions.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.600]   It's really inclusive and nice.
[00:05:53.600 --> 00:05:55.500]   I watched the video last night on Google+,
[00:05:55.500 --> 00:05:59.800]   and that was really-- it was really something to see.
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.500]   And it's a lot of injured veterans or disabled people.
[00:06:03.500 --> 00:06:04.900]   People who couldn't-- who are photographers
[00:06:04.900 --> 00:06:07.500]   who want to take pictures, but just can't get out there.
[00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:08.900]   Glass seems like ideal for this,
[00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:10.300]   because it's your point of view.
[00:06:10.300 --> 00:06:11.000]   I mean, they can see.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:12.600]   You don't always use glass or don't.
[00:06:12.600 --> 00:06:14.400]   No, you don't have to use glass.
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.000]   Doing live hangouts when you're walking in a city
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:18.500]   is pretty tough right now with these.
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:20.400]   I guess they just don't have the Wi-Fi.
[00:06:20.400 --> 00:06:22.400]   It's still more dependable with another city.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:23.700]   Sure, that makes sense.
[00:06:23.700 --> 00:06:24.600]   Very cool.
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:28.500]   Also with the star of a new viral video
[00:06:28.500 --> 00:06:31.400]   that's making the rounds, Renee Richards of our All About
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:32.700]   Android show--
[00:06:32.700 --> 00:06:33.200]   Not Ron.
[00:06:33.200 --> 00:06:34.000]   Ron Richards.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   Renee Richards.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   Was it Renee Richards?
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Tennis player?
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:38.500]   Especially on Friday nights.
[00:06:38.500 --> 00:06:39.500]   Who was Renee Richards?
[00:06:39.500 --> 00:06:42.000]   Tennis player, right?
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:42.500]   Ron Richards.
[00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:43.000]   Yes.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   Happy, I don't know who Renee is.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   Nice.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   It's going to be here.
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:47.500]   Yeah, because I wonder if I could find this.
[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:49.300]   No wonder I was searching for your viral video,
[00:06:49.300 --> 00:06:50.000]   and I couldn't find it.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   It's Ron-- OK.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   No.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.500]   It's you wearing glass for the first time.
[00:06:54.500 --> 00:06:57.000]   Yeah, so after we finished the show on All About Android,
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   this past Tuesday, Jason let me try his--
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Holy cow!
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:02.500]   His glass, and I proceeded to have a freak out on camera.
[00:07:02.500 --> 00:07:04.000]   Have you never tried a monotone?
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:05.500]   I know, this is the first time I've ever seen it.
[00:07:05.500 --> 00:07:06.500]   Oh, my God!
[00:07:06.500 --> 00:07:08.500]   So, and then someone took the 10 minute clip
[00:07:08.500 --> 00:07:10.500]   and edited it down to about two and a half,
[00:07:10.500 --> 00:07:13.500]   or two minutes and 49 seconds, and you see--
[00:07:13.500 --> 00:07:14.500]   Holy cow!
[00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.500]   [laughter]
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:18.500]   It cut all my holy cows, and--
[00:07:18.500 --> 00:07:19.500]   How did he go back?
[00:07:19.500 --> 00:07:21.500]   I believe I said it was a life-altering experience,
[00:07:21.500 --> 00:07:23.500]   and some other hyperbodies.
[00:07:23.500 --> 00:07:24.500]   Do you still feel that way?
[00:07:24.500 --> 00:07:25.500]   I do feel that way.
[00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:26.500]   I do.
[00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:28.500]   If anybody watches All About Android,
[00:07:28.500 --> 00:07:30.500]   notice that I was super skeptical of it.
[00:07:30.500 --> 00:07:32.500]   Yeah, you were the only one on All About Android
[00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:33.500]   who doesn't actually have glass that.
[00:07:33.500 --> 00:07:34.500]   Yes, it was.
[00:07:34.500 --> 00:07:35.500]   Yeah, because I didn't even--
[00:07:35.500 --> 00:07:37.500]   Google I/O last year, I didn't sign up for it.
[00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:40.500]   You know, I signed up, but Jason Hell was kind of my proxy,
[00:07:40.500 --> 00:07:42.500]   and I was going to get it because it's 1,500 bucks,
[00:07:42.500 --> 00:07:44.500]   and then I realized Jason has a new baby.
[00:07:44.500 --> 00:07:46.500]   Who better to wear glass?
[00:07:46.500 --> 00:07:48.500]   And Gina confirmed that because she also has a baby,
[00:07:48.500 --> 00:07:49.500]   and she said it's amazing.
[00:07:49.500 --> 00:07:50.500]   She said she'll be holding the baby,
[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:52.500]   and it'll do something cute, and she just says,
[00:07:52.500 --> 00:07:53.500]   you know, take Victor, and does it?
[00:07:53.500 --> 00:07:56.500]   Well, normally a camera would get in the way of the connection
[00:07:56.500 --> 00:07:58.500]   between mother or father and child,
[00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:00.500]   but that baby, you see the pictures that Gina's taken of.
[00:08:00.500 --> 00:08:02.500]   You can tell she's looking at her mom,
[00:08:02.500 --> 00:08:04.500]   and she's just in love.
[00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:07.500]   That was me using the directions.
[00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.500]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:10.500]   If you're in--
[00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:13.500]   How many views on this chat so far?
[00:08:13.500 --> 00:08:14.500]   54,000?
[00:08:14.500 --> 00:08:15.500]   It'll be more.
[00:08:15.500 --> 00:08:17.500]   And thanks to Jean-Louis for making that out.
[00:08:17.500 --> 00:08:18.500]   He's a fan.
[00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:21.500]   So we were what's hot on Google+ yesterday.
[00:08:21.500 --> 00:08:24.500]   We were on the front page of the Android subreddit.
[00:08:24.500 --> 00:08:26.500]   It pretty much had legs, and--
[00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.500]   Ron, holy cow, Richards.
[00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.500]   My dear sister, back in New York,
[00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:31.500]   who's not one of our tech people,
[00:08:31.500 --> 00:08:33.500]   she's like, oh, I hope Tasha doesn't put you on the show.
[00:08:33.500 --> 00:08:35.500]   She's like, oh, you might be--
[00:08:35.500 --> 00:08:36.500]   Oh, you might be a touch 2.0.
[00:08:36.500 --> 00:08:37.500]   Oh, that'd be awesome.
[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:38.500]   Yeah, but so I went viral.
[00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:40.500]   It only took, what, a podcasting for eight years.
[00:08:40.500 --> 00:08:41.500]   It just took eight years to go on.
[00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:42.500]   It's an awesome day.
[00:08:42.500 --> 00:08:43.500]   Thanks, everybody.
[00:08:43.500 --> 00:08:44.500]   Holy cow.
[00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:47.500]   Also here with us Dwight Silverman from the Houston Chronicle,
[00:08:47.500 --> 00:08:50.500]   blog.cron.com/techblog.
[00:08:50.500 --> 00:08:51.500]   Good to have you.
[00:08:51.500 --> 00:08:52.500]   Good to be here, Leo.
[00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.500]   By the way, Renee Richards was not just a tennis player.
[00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:57.500]   She was a transgender tennis player.
[00:08:57.500 --> 00:08:58.500]   She's drawn it out of a man.
[00:08:58.500 --> 00:08:59.500]   Right.
[00:08:59.500 --> 00:09:00.500]   You can't even bet her.
[00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:01.500]   Right.
[00:09:01.500 --> 00:09:03.500]   I wasn't going to bring that up.
[00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:05.500]   Holy cow.
[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:09.500]   By the way, we have a paywall too.
[00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:12.500]   And so does the San Francisco Chronicle,
[00:09:12.500 --> 00:09:16.500]   which is one of our sister paper to the Houston Chronicle.
[00:09:16.500 --> 00:09:19.500]   And it's been a really interesting experiment, I got to say.
[00:09:19.500 --> 00:09:21.500]   Does it work?
[00:09:21.500 --> 00:09:24.500]   It's still building audience slowly.
[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:28.500]   I think it's what's really interesting is what it's doing to our
[00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:32.500]   newsroom in that we're having to come up with different types of
[00:09:32.500 --> 00:09:35.500]   content for the free site versus the pay site.
[00:09:35.500 --> 00:09:37.500]   And so it's changing the way the newsroom works.
[00:09:37.500 --> 00:09:41.500]   It's kind of finally, it's really getting us to think digitally
[00:09:41.500 --> 00:09:42.500]   from the start.
[00:09:42.500 --> 00:09:45.500]   And it's a, I'm really excited about it.
[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:48.500]   It's making some really good changes for us, I think.
[00:09:48.500 --> 00:09:51.500]   And I presume it's the same thing as happening in San Francisco and San
[00:09:51.500 --> 00:09:54.500]   Antonio, which has also started it.
[00:09:54.500 --> 00:09:57.500]   Historically, you can't get somebody to pay for something they've
[00:09:57.500 --> 00:09:59.500]   been getting for free.
[00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:03.500]   Well, the idea is what we put on the pay site is not necessarily
[00:10:03.500 --> 00:10:05.500]   what you get for free.
[00:10:05.500 --> 00:10:09.500]   Every newspaper does enterprise, every newspaper kind of does
[00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:11.500]   things that no one else in the market does.
[00:10:11.500 --> 00:10:14.500]   We'll do things that television won't do, for example.
[00:10:14.500 --> 00:10:15.500]   And that's what's ending up.
[00:10:15.500 --> 00:10:18.500]   But the commodity news, the breaking news, the things that
[00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:22.500]   everybody else is doing, as well as a lot more pop culture and kind
[00:10:22.500 --> 00:10:26.500]   of more Houston is fun things are going on the free site.
[00:10:26.500 --> 00:10:28.500]   And it's really two different audiences.
[00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:32.500]   In fact, when we look at what is happening in terms of, in terms
[00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:36.500]   of like the most viewed stories on each site, they're two completely
[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:37.500]   different things.
[00:10:37.500 --> 00:10:38.500]   They're different audiences.
[00:10:38.500 --> 00:10:39.500]   Isn't that interesting?
[00:10:39.500 --> 00:10:40.500]   Yeah, it's very interesting.
[00:10:40.500 --> 00:10:41.500]   It's fascinating.
[00:10:41.500 --> 00:10:43.500]   There's nothing worse than getting a link from somebody and
[00:10:43.500 --> 00:10:44.500]   hitting that paywall.
[00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:45.500]   That's, you know, like Dave, David.
[00:10:45.500 --> 00:10:50.500]   But what we've done is when we, when you share socially from an
[00:10:50.500 --> 00:10:53.500]   account, if you've got an account on the paywall and you share it
[00:10:53.500 --> 00:10:55.500]   out, it's a free view.
[00:10:55.500 --> 00:10:56.500]   Yeah.
[00:10:56.500 --> 00:10:57.500]   That's the smart thing.
[00:10:57.500 --> 00:11:00.500]   They've got to realize that it's getting shared socially or stuff
[00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.500]   that's getting a lot of views, take the paywall down, make it
[00:11:02.500 --> 00:11:03.500]   free because you want the page views.
[00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:06.500]   So, you know, everything works or have those services that are
[00:11:06.500 --> 00:11:07.500]   premium.
[00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:08.500]   Yeah.
[00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:12.500]   Uh, one point one billion dollars.
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:14.500]   It's a new, a new number.
[00:11:14.500 --> 00:11:17.500]   Uh, that is how much it's apparently Yahoo.
[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:19.500]   We're going to find out tomorrow probably Yahoo.
[00:11:19.500 --> 00:11:22.500]   Uh, board, according to the Wall Street Journal has agreed to pay
[00:11:22.500 --> 00:11:23.500]   for Tumblr.
[00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:24.500]   All cash.
[00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:25.500]   It's not a stock deal.
[00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:26.500]   That's the word on the street.
[00:11:26.500 --> 00:11:28.500]   Is that a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a, it's a
[00:11:28.500 --> 00:11:29.500]   car.
[00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.500]   Who dropped out of high school to create the blogging platform.
[00:11:32.500 --> 00:11:34.500]   Uh, Tumblr's been a huge success.
[00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:36.500]   I fell in love with it very early.
[00:11:36.500 --> 00:11:40.500]   It just was such an easy way to create what before Tumblr was a
[00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:42.500]   genre called the tumble log.
[00:11:42.500 --> 00:11:44.500]   Um, and it was hard to do in the early days.
[00:11:44.500 --> 00:11:47.500]   You had to get a template and all this stuff and the tumble
[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:48.500]   just made it very easy.
[00:11:48.500 --> 00:11:53.500]   And, uh, Carp raised, I think 125 million dollars to get a
[00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:55.500]   valuation of 800 million.
[00:11:55.500 --> 00:11:58.500]   Uh, but it's going, uh, according to Cara Swisher and if Cara says
[00:11:58.500 --> 00:12:02.500]   it's true, it must be a 1.1 billion dollars.
[00:12:02.500 --> 00:12:04.500]   Is that a big number, Omala?
[00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:05.500]   Or is it worth it?
[00:12:05.500 --> 00:12:09.500]   That's not that big a number in larger scheme of things.
[00:12:09.500 --> 00:12:14.500]   Um, you know, it's like Yahoo wants to be relevant.
[00:12:14.500 --> 00:12:16.500]   What's a billion dollars?
[00:12:16.500 --> 00:12:18.500]   It was a billion dollars there.
[00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:21.500]   And actually if you really look at it, it doesn't cost them a
[00:12:21.500 --> 00:12:25.500]   lot of money because they are spending the money they're going
[00:12:25.500 --> 00:12:29.500]   to make from Alibaba IPO on stuff like Tumblr.
[00:12:29.500 --> 00:12:32.500]   So Alibaba valuation is going up pretty rapidly.
[00:12:32.500 --> 00:12:37.500]   And as a result of that, they're beginning to see pretty high.
[00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:41.500]   Um, they have a lot more cash to play around with.
[00:12:41.500 --> 00:12:46.500]   And, and, uh, 80% of Alibaba, and they want to sell half of it
[00:12:46.500 --> 00:12:50.500]   in Alibaba's valuation right now is about 70 billion dollars.
[00:12:50.500 --> 00:12:54.500]   And if then it goes public next year, it's going to be worth
[00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:56.500]   about a hundred billion dollars.
[00:12:56.500 --> 00:13:00.500]   So, you know, their value, they will have a lot more cash to play with.
[00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:03.500]   And these can pay off Jason Calcana sent out in his newsletter.
[00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:05.500]   He said, what 1.1 billion?
[00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:06.500]   That's nothing.
[00:13:06.500 --> 00:13:08.500]   He says the people are complaining about that are poor,
[00:13:08.500 --> 00:13:11.500]   for hourly employees at newspapers.
[00:13:11.500 --> 00:13:12.500]   All right.
[00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:16.500]   For whom, you know, this is a pretty big amount of money.
[00:13:16.500 --> 00:13:19.500]   He said, but for a company, they Yahoo could buy a hundred of these.
[00:13:19.500 --> 00:13:21.500]   It's a, it's the payoff potential is huge.
[00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:25.500]   Look what Google got out of YouTube, which they paid only a few billion dollars for,
[00:13:25.500 --> 00:13:29.500]   and is now worth probably, you know, a hundred times that.
[00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:33.500]   Um, so apologies to Dwight Silverman on behalf of Jason Calcana.
[00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:35.500]   I make almost that much.
[00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:37.500]   I have to be honest with you.
[00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:40.500]   I, I, I, it's typical Jason, right?
[00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:44.500]   You know, immediately insult somebody before he can even make his point.
[00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:48.500]   Um, but, but I think it was a good point, which is, while it sounds like a lark number,
[00:13:48.500 --> 00:13:50.500]   I think with a B is going to get your attention.
[00:13:50.500 --> 00:13:53.500]   It's not that much money, even for a company like Yahoo that's struggling a little bit.
[00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:56.500]   And the opportunity for Yahoo is to be hip.
[00:13:56.500 --> 00:13:57.500]   Is that right?
[00:13:57.500 --> 00:13:58.500]   Totally.
[00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:01.500]   I mean, if you look at it, and actually as, as low as I am to agree with Jason and,
[00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:05.500]   and some of his points, he, he did make the right assertion in his newsletter that was,
[00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.500]   um, you know, kids aren't on Facebook anymore.
[00:14:07.500 --> 00:14:08.500]   They're on Tumblr.
[00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:09.500]   Right.
[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:11.500]   Like teens, twenties, they live on Tumblr.
[00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:13.500]   It's a lot like the Instagram acquisition.
[00:14:13.500 --> 00:14:16.500]   I think Facebook looked at Instagram and said we could lose our shirt to this company,
[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:19.500]   because everybody, everybody under the age of twenties, Instagramming.
[00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:20.500]   Yeah.
[00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:25.420]   It appears, I've noticed a market change in the last six to eight months where when a funny
[00:14:25.420 --> 00:14:27.500]   thing on the internet gets sent to me, it's on Tumblr.
[00:14:27.500 --> 00:14:28.500]   It's Tumblr.
[00:14:28.500 --> 00:14:31.500]   It's like, you know, just this past week, a friend of mine sent the worst room on the worst
[00:14:31.500 --> 00:14:32.500]   room dot tumblr dot com.
[00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:37.500]   And it's all photos from Craig's list of bad apartments in New York City, like $300 for
[00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:39.500]   a room in Brooklyn Heights or something like that.
[00:14:39.500 --> 00:14:40.500]   It turns out Tumblr is a photo sharing site.
[00:14:40.500 --> 00:14:44.500]   We thought it was going to be about, you know, sharing quotes or sharing links.
[00:14:44.500 --> 00:14:45.500]   It's a photo sharing site.
[00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:47.500]   And my day job, I work in comic books.
[00:14:47.500 --> 00:14:50.380]   I work for a comic book publisher, so much art on Tumblr.
[00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:52.060]   So many artists posting stuff up.
[00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:56.020]   We'll have, you know, like main comic book artists putting their stuff up on Tumblr before
[00:14:56.020 --> 00:14:57.020]   it gets up on anywhere else.
[00:14:57.020 --> 00:14:58.020]   Yeah.
[00:14:58.020 --> 00:14:59.020]   Here's the worst room.
[00:14:59.020 --> 00:15:00.340]   This is, this is great.
[00:15:00.340 --> 00:15:04.300]   These are literally Craig's list, Craig's list things, Craig's list things in New York
[00:15:04.300 --> 00:15:06.300]   City for $750 in Lunes.
[00:15:06.300 --> 00:15:09.860]   Oh, my friend James sent me this.
[00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:13.740]   And the thing is, it's, this stuff used to be out there on WordPress or it used to be
[00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:14.740]   out there on Twitter.
[00:15:14.740 --> 00:15:15.740]   It's easy to do on Tumblr.
[00:15:15.740 --> 00:15:17.820]   It's in two seconds you have a site up like that.
[00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:22.340]   And me as a marketer, I'm using, Tumblr is so easy to build a site very quickly, put
[00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:24.900]   up your branding, have an easy way for people to submit to you.
[00:15:24.900 --> 00:15:28.260]   Their submission engine is, is really elegant, really simple.
[00:15:28.260 --> 00:15:30.660]   And there's just millions of people playing around on it.
[00:15:30.660 --> 00:15:36.060]   So when Rick Perry said he had binders full of women before the debate was over, there
[00:15:36.060 --> 00:15:38.900]   was a Tumblr binders full of women.
[00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:40.460]   Yeah.
[00:15:40.460 --> 00:15:42.540]   Which is now gone, by the way.
[00:15:42.540 --> 00:15:44.260]   And that's exactly what Tumblr's for.
[00:15:44.260 --> 00:15:46.940]   It's an instant, it's an instant place that you could do this.
[00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:50.980]   When TechCrunch did the little, did the little jam on Michaela's not impressed when, when
[00:15:50.980 --> 00:15:54.220]   the rumors were the Tumblr was going to reject the offer and they said Tumblr's not impressed.
[00:15:54.220 --> 00:15:55.220]   Right.
[00:15:55.220 --> 00:15:56.220]   That was a play on Tumblr.
[00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:59.980]   Play on Tumblr because the Michaela's not impressed from the Olympics was on Tumblr.
[00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:04.700]   Like it, so Tumblr really has quietly become the hotspot on the web for the younger generation.
[00:16:04.700 --> 00:16:05.860]   It's not Facebook, it's Tumblr.
[00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:07.620]   By the way, I think John Constein got that wrong.
[00:16:07.620 --> 00:16:08.900]   I think Tumblr was impressed.
[00:16:08.900 --> 00:16:09.900]   I'd be impressed.
[00:16:09.900 --> 00:16:11.300]   Yeah, it's hard not to.
[00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:15.380]   I mean, with that investment, only 125 million in, that's a great return.
[00:16:15.380 --> 00:16:16.380]   Yeah.
[00:16:16.380 --> 00:16:17.380]   So.
[00:16:17.380 --> 00:16:18.620]   It was Mitt Romney, not Rick Perry.
[00:16:18.620 --> 00:16:21.340]   Did I say, anyway, I could fuse all those guys.
[00:16:21.340 --> 00:16:22.340]   They all have the same hair.
[00:16:22.340 --> 00:16:27.380]   Well, Mormons do have binders full of women.
[00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:30.980]   So a good move for Marissa Meyer.
[00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:33.180]   Is this, it seems to me it's a good move.
[00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:36.820]   This is the kind of thing Marissa came to Yahoo to do.
[00:16:36.820 --> 00:16:38.580]   Well, I think you're--
[00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:40.380]   Go ahead, um.
[00:16:40.380 --> 00:16:43.900]   I just, I made an assertion in one of my early posts.
[00:16:43.900 --> 00:16:48.860]   This is like a middle-aged guy hanging out with young people, like trying to look hip.
[00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:52.540]   So, you know, if they have to spend a billion dollars to do it, why not?
[00:16:52.540 --> 00:16:54.140]   But will it work?
[00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:55.780]   You know, I don't know.
[00:16:55.780 --> 00:17:02.420]   I think at least it's a, it's not a bad idea for them to do this.
[00:17:02.420 --> 00:17:06.060]   Though I feel that if they were spending this kind of money, they should have gone after
[00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:14.820]   a company like Pinterest, which is more, more along the lines of Yahoo's traditional strengths,
[00:17:14.820 --> 00:17:22.300]   which is like, you know, more, more women use it, more, more brand-centric and more wholesome
[00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:25.340]   in that in some sense of the way word.
[00:17:25.340 --> 00:17:29.820]   And they could have made more money monetizing Pinterest much faster.
[00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:32.140]   But I think that Tumblr is a good acquisition.
[00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:43.940]   I'm happy for David, who I remember him pitching me about Tumblr in 2007 in the early days
[00:17:43.940 --> 00:17:48.540]   of, at a coffee shop near my house.
[00:17:48.540 --> 00:17:53.580]   And we talked about how he wanted the whole thing to play out.
[00:17:53.580 --> 00:17:58.020]   And it has played out as he had planned in his early days.
[00:17:58.020 --> 00:17:59.020]   So pretty impressive.
[00:17:59.020 --> 00:18:01.140]   He saw it going this way.
[00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:01.980]   Yeah.
[00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:04.620]   I'm not that he would get acquired by Yahoo.
[00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:13.260]   He was pretty clear about why people would share this certain way on the web.
[00:18:13.260 --> 00:18:15.140]   How old was he when you talked to him?
[00:18:15.140 --> 00:18:16.140]   I can't remember.
[00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:17.140]   He was a kid.
[00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:19.340]   He was like seven years ago.
[00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:20.340]   Yeah.
[00:18:20.340 --> 00:18:21.340]   So he'd be like 17 or 18.
[00:18:21.340 --> 00:18:22.340]   He was a kid.
[00:18:22.340 --> 00:18:25.140]   And I guess the question now is, will the, how bad will the exodus be?
[00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:29.980]   Because there's always a, well, they say, and now Cara says that they've got carp for
[00:18:29.980 --> 00:18:31.300]   four years locked in.
[00:18:31.300 --> 00:18:31.820]   Wow.
[00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:35.740]   So they're going to have the same kind of autonomy that Instagram has at Facebook.
[00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:36.740]   The brand won't change.
[00:18:36.740 --> 00:18:39.140]   It'll still look like an independent entity.
[00:18:39.140 --> 00:18:40.140]   And I think that's really important.
[00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:42.700]   If it suddenly says Tumblr by Yahoo.
[00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:44.180]   Or Tumblr with an ex-enlation point.
[00:18:44.180 --> 00:18:45.180]   Yeah, that's not going to go.
[00:18:45.180 --> 00:18:47.020]   That's not going to fly.
[00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:50.940]   And I don't think that the people who use Tumblr are that wired into who owns it as
[00:18:50.940 --> 00:18:53.740]   much as, is this the easy to use platform.
[00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:54.740]   But you're right.
[00:18:54.740 --> 00:18:56.540]   It's always risky when you buy something like that that.
[00:18:56.540 --> 00:18:57.540]   It's even up to baby.
[00:18:57.540 --> 00:19:01.620]   Before year, I mean, we, I mean Yahoo doesn't have the best track record with these acquisitions.
[00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:04.220]   I mean, we saw that one thing Marissa has to really turn.
[00:19:04.220 --> 00:19:05.220]   Exactly.
[00:19:05.220 --> 00:19:08.300]   That, that, if it wasn't Marissa in the driver's seat, I'd be a little worried after delicious
[00:19:08.300 --> 00:19:09.300]   and fucking all that.
[00:19:09.300 --> 00:19:12.740]   Terry Semmel doesn't go to David Carp and say, hey, we'll keep it exactly the same way,
[00:19:12.740 --> 00:19:13.740]   man.
[00:19:13.740 --> 00:19:14.740]   We're not going to mess with it.
[00:19:14.740 --> 00:19:15.740]   We love Tumblr.
[00:19:15.740 --> 00:19:16.740]   It's going to be the same.
[00:19:16.740 --> 00:19:17.740]   We love you.
[00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:18.740]   You're beautiful, babe.
[00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.220]   I think that it's pretty clear that only Marissa could go to somebody like David.
[00:19:20.220 --> 00:19:24.300]   Apparently she did personally woo him considerably and really said, look, you're going to get
[00:19:24.300 --> 00:19:25.540]   complete autonomy.
[00:19:25.540 --> 00:19:27.300]   We're not going to take this over.
[00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:31.500]   So now it's a coincidental, I think, but tomorrow is a big announcement from Yahoo.
[00:19:31.500 --> 00:19:33.660]   Dwight, do we know what they're going to say tomorrow?
[00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:35.340]   It's not about Tumblr.
[00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:40.620]   Supposedly, it's about Flickr, but I suspect that Tumblr will play into it if the deal
[00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:44.180]   has been done today.
[00:19:44.180 --> 00:19:49.780]   There is, I think, a, you know, someone mentioned the idea of the Exodus and he was talking
[00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:54.820]   about talent, but I think you also got to think about an exodus of users because if people
[00:19:54.820 --> 00:20:02.340]   are freaking out over the idea of Yahoo's culture versus Tumblr's culture, you can promise
[00:20:02.340 --> 00:20:08.740]   autonomy, but the first time, say that a big media company comes to Yahoo and says, hey,
[00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:10.900]   you know, they're putting copyright and material on there.
[00:20:10.900 --> 00:20:11.900]   Can you take it off, please?
[00:20:11.900 --> 00:20:13.900]   You own it now.
[00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:18.100]   And Yahoo puts the Bigfoot on some hot meme.
[00:20:18.100 --> 00:20:21.740]   That is really going to kind of kill off, you know, immediately will kill off the goodwill
[00:20:21.740 --> 00:20:23.660]   that it has with its users.
[00:20:23.660 --> 00:20:30.220]   There's already a BuzzFeed item up there about people who, Don Tumblr, who are already putting
[00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:32.340]   tumb logs up about Yahoo.
[00:20:32.340 --> 00:20:34.980]   And so, this is right.
[00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:35.980]   Right.
[00:20:35.980 --> 00:20:40.100]   Well, yeah, with such a young audience base, they're going to, they're going to cry sell
[00:20:40.100 --> 00:20:41.100]   out.
[00:20:41.100 --> 00:20:42.100]   They're going to cry, you know, and then.
[00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:43.100]   You say even hear about, well, I guess.
[00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:44.100]   Well, they're going to hear what they're going to hear.
[00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:45.100]   At that price.
[00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:46.100]   Oh, they know about it.
[00:20:46.100 --> 00:20:47.100]   Yeah.
[00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:48.100]   They know about it.
[00:20:48.100 --> 00:20:52.660]   So, Trey, you probably were on Flickr before you moved to Google+, I would imagine.
[00:20:52.660 --> 00:20:54.540]   Yeah, well, Flickr used to be the only game in town.
[00:20:54.540 --> 00:20:55.540]   That was where you went.
[00:20:55.540 --> 00:20:56.540]   Yeah.
[00:20:56.540 --> 00:20:58.980]   And it's a pretty, it's an older crowd there now, you know.
[00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:00.740]   It's been around seven or eight years.
[00:21:00.740 --> 00:21:01.740]   I know.
[00:21:01.740 --> 00:21:04.340]   I went back when they put out the app.
[00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:05.340]   Yeah.
[00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:07.540]   I had let my pro-lapse.
[00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:08.820]   That's not a good way to say that.
[00:21:08.820 --> 00:21:11.340]   I had let my profession.
[00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:12.340]   Yeah.
[00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:15.620]   I had a pro-lapse to pro-account.
[00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:18.740]   And I paid the 40 bucks as soon as they came out with the iOS thing.
[00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:19.740]   I wanted to send a signal.
[00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:21.580]   Yeah, you continued to improve this.
[00:21:21.580 --> 00:21:22.580]   I pay every month.
[00:21:22.580 --> 00:21:23.580]   They're good.
[00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:24.580]   It's worth it.
[00:21:24.580 --> 00:21:25.580]   Yeah, it's still not bad.
[00:21:25.580 --> 00:21:26.580]   Yeah.
[00:21:26.580 --> 00:21:28.860]   But where do you get all the attention is on Google+, that's pretty.
[00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:30.660]   Google+, Facebook and Pinterest.
[00:21:30.660 --> 00:21:34.740]   I get a lot more interest on Pinterest than I do on Flickr.
[00:21:34.740 --> 00:21:38.780]   You know, Flickr is very, you know, it's all photographers on there, which is fine.
[00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:39.780]   Right.
[00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:40.780]   But it's not really the general public.
[00:21:40.780 --> 00:21:42.580]   It's just photographers talking to photographers.
[00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:43.580]   How about 500px?
[00:21:43.580 --> 00:21:44.580]   Same problem.
[00:21:44.580 --> 00:21:48.980]   500px is it's a beautiful site and there's amazing photographers on there.
[00:21:48.980 --> 00:21:51.180]   But is it even smaller than Flickr?
[00:21:51.180 --> 00:21:52.180]   Right.
[00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:56.180]   And you're trying to reach viewers, an audience, not other photographers?
[00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:57.180]   Yeah.
[00:21:57.180 --> 00:21:58.580]   Well, it's fine to talk with a photographer.
[00:21:58.580 --> 00:21:59.580]   That's cool.
[00:21:59.580 --> 00:22:02.220]   You know, talk shop, talk about lenses and that sort of stuff.
[00:22:02.220 --> 00:22:06.980]   But you know, I think photographers spend way too much time trying to impress other photographers.
[00:22:06.980 --> 00:22:10.180]   You know, those are the kind of people that are on Flickr and that's fine.
[00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:12.220]   It used to be that way though.
[00:22:12.220 --> 00:22:13.220]   Did it?
[00:22:13.220 --> 00:22:14.220]   Well, it was always like that.
[00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:15.220]   It was always like that.
[00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:16.220]   Yeah.
[00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:18.540]   You ever seen like snakes mating as that big ball of just nonsense.
[00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:20.660]   Kind of what Flickr is like.
[00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:21.660]   But...
[00:22:21.660 --> 00:22:23.220]   So what should she do to make it?
[00:22:23.220 --> 00:22:28.820]   Well, I think they need to do something more like Tumblr.
[00:22:28.820 --> 00:22:33.380]   I don't know how they could possibly fuse the two, but it allows people that can't create
[00:22:33.380 --> 00:22:35.020]   anything to curate.
[00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:36.020]   Right.
[00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:37.980]   And I don't know what percentage is on Tumblr.
[00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:38.980]   I have a Tumblr thing.
[00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:41.620]   It doesn't get much attention.
[00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:47.220]   But I think I'm one of the few creators that inserts fresh things into the system.
[00:22:47.220 --> 00:22:48.220]   That's not how Tumblr works.
[00:22:48.220 --> 00:22:50.220]   It's mostly reblogging other people.
[00:22:50.220 --> 00:22:51.220]   So much and other stuff.
[00:22:51.220 --> 00:22:52.220]   Right?
[00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:54.860]   It's all curation and Flickr is all creation.
[00:22:54.860 --> 00:22:55.860]   Right.
[00:22:55.860 --> 00:22:58.740]   So maybe they've got some grand plan to fuse these two together.
[00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:01.300]   I'm just looking to try to find some stats around Tumblr.
[00:23:01.300 --> 00:23:02.900]   And, uh, in Italy, this is a year ago.
[00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:05.480]   But in April 2012, they said they're post...
[00:23:05.480 --> 00:23:08.180]   They're, uh, Tumblr bangs out 55 million posts per day.
[00:23:08.180 --> 00:23:09.180]   Wow.
[00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:10.180]   Which is...
[00:23:10.180 --> 00:23:12.380]   And what's percentage of that is original content versus that reblogging.
[00:23:12.380 --> 00:23:13.380]   Yeah.
[00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:14.380]   But a lot of it is reblogging.
[00:23:14.380 --> 00:23:16.380]   A lot of it is that viral network effect.
[00:23:16.380 --> 00:23:20.540]   Well, and as a content creator tray, uh, I think Dwight makes an excellent point.
[00:23:20.540 --> 00:23:24.700]   You know, uh, it's one thing when you're an independent, you can kind of ignore the
[00:23:24.700 --> 00:23:28.940]   requests of big media companies to take stuff down, which Tumblr has done.
[00:23:28.940 --> 00:23:32.460]   But it's another thing, if you're Yahoo and you're trying to make nice with big content
[00:23:32.460 --> 00:23:33.460]   companies.
[00:23:33.460 --> 00:23:34.460]   Yeah.
[00:23:34.460 --> 00:23:36.300]   There's all kinds of stuff going on on Tumblr, brother.
[00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:37.300]   Yeah.
[00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:38.300]   I mean, there's...
[00:23:38.300 --> 00:23:39.300]   Well, there's the porn problem, too.
[00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:42.300]   I don't know how much a Tumblr is born, but that's all I see.
[00:23:42.300 --> 00:23:43.300]   Yeah.
[00:23:43.300 --> 00:23:47.300]   For example, uh...
[00:23:47.300 --> 00:23:50.300]   It's who you follow.
[00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:54.020]   Uh, there's a lot of adult content on Tumblr.
[00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:56.580]   And I don't know if y'all who cares because there's a lot of adult content on Flickr,
[00:23:56.580 --> 00:23:57.580]   too.
[00:23:57.580 --> 00:24:00.220]   They have a safe search and they just block it unless you're, uh, agree to it.
[00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:01.220]   Yeah.
[00:24:01.220 --> 00:24:06.140]   So, in the, in the story today that, uh, all things D did, right, there's that, uh, there's
[00:24:06.140 --> 00:24:09.260]   that picture from, uh, girls in yoga pants.
[00:24:09.260 --> 00:24:10.260]   And what's interesting is...
[00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:11.260]   Wait a minute.
[00:24:11.260 --> 00:24:12.260]   Girls in yoga pants at tumblr.com?
[00:24:12.260 --> 00:24:13.260]   Hold the phone.
[00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:15.700]   So, this is interesting.
[00:24:15.700 --> 00:24:20.100]   There's a separate girls with yogapants.com.
[00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:24.140]   It's part of the people in Walmart, people in Walmart network.
[00:24:24.140 --> 00:24:30.580]   And the stuff on girls in yoga pants is much more, much more not safe for work than girls
[00:24:30.580 --> 00:24:33.060]   at yogapants.com.
[00:24:33.060 --> 00:24:38.820]   They have much more freedom to kind of be, um, have a lot of nudity and, and raunchiness.
[00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:39.820]   But they're wearing yoga pants.
[00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:41.500]   On the regular website.
[00:24:41.500 --> 00:24:42.500]   That's the same site.
[00:24:42.500 --> 00:24:43.500]   Yes, they're wearing it.
[00:24:43.500 --> 00:24:44.500]   Sometimes they're wearing it.
[00:24:44.500 --> 00:24:45.500]   Oh, okay.
[00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:46.500]   They aren't always wearing it.
[00:24:46.500 --> 00:24:48.980]   So, as the people of Walmart keep their clothes on, I don't...
[00:24:48.980 --> 00:24:51.500]   Let's keep the hat up and keep their clothes on.
[00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:52.500]   Let's do that.
[00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:53.500]   Don't cross the streams, man.
[00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:55.500]   That can really be a problem.
[00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:58.500]   I have one other thing about, one other thing about Flickr.
[00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:00.420]   Um, Yahoo.
[00:25:00.420 --> 00:25:03.620]   Marissa Meyer has said that they need to emphasize mobile.
[00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:05.100]   They need to crack mobile.
[00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:10.900]   Uh, Flickr is, uh, has ignored mobile for a long time, but that app that they released,
[00:25:10.900 --> 00:25:14.460]   which, you know, got you looking back at it again.
[00:25:14.460 --> 00:25:17.860]   I just have a feeling that's the key to what they're going to do, is that they're going
[00:25:17.860 --> 00:25:22.780]   to make Flickr much more friendly to mobile devices.
[00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:26.060]   After all, the number one, um, uh, phone on there right now is the iPhone.
[00:25:26.060 --> 00:25:28.020]   It's a, you know, that's a camera phone.
[00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:29.020]   That's a smartphone.
[00:25:29.020 --> 00:25:31.420]   It's another one's phone in the world according to Apple.
[00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:32.420]   Right.
[00:25:32.420 --> 00:25:37.300]   And so, what's happening is that people are taking more and more pictures with non-traditional
[00:25:37.300 --> 00:25:38.300]   cameras.
[00:25:38.300 --> 00:25:40.900]   I think that's what Flickr is going to emphasize tomorrow.
[00:25:40.900 --> 00:25:44.620]   Cause they talk about sharing in the, on the invitation.
[00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:46.180]   And I think this all has to do with mobile.
[00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:49.420]   That might be how you handle the problem of, of no new content on Tumblr.
[00:25:49.420 --> 00:25:51.540]   Oh, you were going to say something?
[00:25:51.540 --> 00:25:55.980]   I just was saying where I come from, you know, the land where yoga came from.
[00:25:55.980 --> 00:25:58.060]   There was no such thing as yoga pants.
[00:25:58.060 --> 00:25:59.060]   Just making it up.
[00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:04.060]   What, what wasn't a yoga loin cloth?
[00:26:04.060 --> 00:26:05.060]   I think.
[00:26:05.060 --> 00:26:06.060]   Yeah, kind of.
[00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:07.060]   Yeah.
[00:26:07.060 --> 00:26:08.060]   That's a little more interesting.
[00:26:08.060 --> 00:26:09.500]   He says he's starting a new tumb log.
[00:26:09.500 --> 00:26:10.500]   He just started it already.
[00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:12.660]   That's how easy it is called Omen yoga pants.
[00:26:12.660 --> 00:26:13.660]   Yeah.
[00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:14.660]   It's not even a hat.
[00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:15.660]   It's already big.
[00:26:15.660 --> 00:26:16.660]   Yeah.
[00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:18.300]   The world doesn't need to see that.
[00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:21.740]   That's, that's like a natural contraceptive.
[00:26:21.740 --> 00:26:22.740]   But you do yoga.
[00:26:22.740 --> 00:26:23.740]   You do yoga.
[00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:24.740]   You look like you do yoga.
[00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:26.780]   No, I do meditation.
[00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:27.780]   Meditation.
[00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:28.780]   That's very good for you.
[00:26:28.780 --> 00:26:29.780]   Yeah.
[00:26:29.780 --> 00:26:30.780]   Because I got really angry about things.
[00:26:30.780 --> 00:26:31.940]   So I need to meditate.
[00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:32.940]   Really?
[00:26:32.940 --> 00:26:33.940]   You're such a sweet guy.
[00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:35.500]   So you used to have a temper before all of this.
[00:26:35.500 --> 00:26:37.980]   And then I just see a lot of stupidity on the web.
[00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:39.340]   And then I just lose my cool.
[00:26:39.340 --> 00:26:40.340]   Ah, the web.
[00:26:40.340 --> 00:26:41.340]   That's the problem right there.
[00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:42.340]   That is the problem.
[00:26:42.340 --> 00:26:43.340]   Stay off the web.
[00:26:43.340 --> 00:26:45.020]   It's just trouble.
[00:26:45.020 --> 00:26:47.620]   We've made a horrible mistake here with our careers.
[00:26:47.620 --> 00:26:49.540]   Hey, we're going to take a break.
[00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:50.540]   We've got a great panel.
[00:26:50.540 --> 00:26:51.540]   Oh, I'm Malek from giga.
[00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:54.260]   Oh, I'm Trey Radcliffe of stuck in customs.com.
[00:26:54.260 --> 00:26:58.020]   Great photographer Ron Richards from all about Android.
[00:26:58.020 --> 00:26:59.460]   What's the name of the comic book?
[00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:00.460]   Or for image comics.
[00:27:00.460 --> 00:27:01.460]   Image comics.
[00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:02.460]   Do the walking dead.
[00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:03.460]   I love that.
[00:27:03.460 --> 00:27:04.460]   Yeah.
[00:27:04.460 --> 00:27:05.460]   Yeah.
[00:27:05.460 --> 00:27:06.460]   Yeah.
[00:27:06.460 --> 00:27:07.460]   As well.
[00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:08.460]   Wow.
[00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:09.460]   A bunch of other great ones too.
[00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:10.460]   Oh, that's awesome.
[00:27:10.460 --> 00:27:15.460]   And from the Houston Chronicle, the poorly paid, but awfully good looking Dwight Silverman.
[00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:16.460]   Great.
[00:27:16.460 --> 00:27:17.460]   Mmm.
[00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:18.460]   Mmm.
[00:27:18.460 --> 00:27:19.460]   Mmm.
[00:27:19.460 --> 00:27:20.460]   Great to have you all.
[00:27:20.460 --> 00:27:24.460]   We're talking about our sponsor today, Audible.com.
[00:27:24.460 --> 00:27:29.620]   I just, you know, actually I just downloaded the Audible app for Windows 8.
[00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:31.860]   It is so beautiful, the Metro app.
[00:27:31.860 --> 00:27:35.300]   They've got apps now for iPhone, Android, Windows, Phone.
[00:27:35.300 --> 00:27:37.460]   It's a great way to browse your content.
[00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:39.420]   My library, I've been an Audible fan.
[00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:40.860]   These are the best audio books in the world.
[00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:42.980]   I've been an Audible listener since 2000.
[00:27:42.980 --> 00:27:45.980]   So I have 500 books now in here.
[00:27:45.980 --> 00:27:48.500]   And these are just some of the, by the way, Trey Radcliffe.
[00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:49.500]   I did.
[00:27:49.500 --> 00:27:50.500]   I have leveled up as my friend.
[00:27:50.500 --> 00:27:54.260]   I have leveled up because I read both of Patrick Rothfuss's King Killer Chronicles.
[00:27:54.260 --> 00:27:56.980]   In fact, we had Patrick Rothfuss on triangulation.
[00:27:56.980 --> 00:27:57.980]   He's a wonderful guy.
[00:27:57.980 --> 00:27:58.980]   He's a great guy.
[00:27:58.980 --> 00:28:00.740]   He talks about you quite a bit.
[00:28:00.740 --> 00:28:01.740]   He's awesome.
[00:28:01.740 --> 00:28:04.380]   He has a charity.
[00:28:04.380 --> 00:28:05.980]   We might even go to Nepal together.
[00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:06.980]   That's right.
[00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:07.980]   He talked about that.
[00:28:07.980 --> 00:28:09.980]   As a great reader for that book, isn't it?
[00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:10.980]   The Nick Podel.
[00:28:10.980 --> 00:28:11.980]   Yeah.
[00:28:11.980 --> 00:28:13.460]   In fact, I really enjoyed it.
[00:28:13.460 --> 00:28:19.340]   So I just finished, there's the book, one of the King Killer Chronicles, which is called
[00:28:19.340 --> 00:28:20.340]   The Name of the Wind.
[00:28:20.340 --> 00:28:21.340]   The Name of the Wind.
[00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:24.620]   And I just finished the Wise Man's Fear, as you can see right here, which is a book two
[00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:26.140]   of the King Killer Chronicles.
[00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:31.380]   I'd highly, you know, you could get both of these right now, absolutely free if you wanted
[00:28:31.380 --> 00:28:32.380]   to.
[00:28:32.380 --> 00:28:35.740]   What you have to do is go to audible.com/twit2.
[00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:37.660]   You'll be signing up for the platinum account.
[00:28:37.660 --> 00:28:38.660]   That's two books a month.
[00:28:38.660 --> 00:28:40.580]   Well, two credits a month, but these are two credits.
[00:28:40.580 --> 00:28:42.300]   Most of the books are a single credit.
[00:28:42.300 --> 00:28:46.620]   And you could be listening within minutes too.
[00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:49.260]   And I think that did you read it in text first and then listened to it?
[00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:50.460]   No, I went all audio.
[00:28:50.460 --> 00:28:51.460]   I do too.
[00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:53.140]   Now I'm on the evolutionary void.
[00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:54.660]   Oh, that's really good.
[00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:55.660]   You're starting to listen.
[00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:57.220]   You know, see, this is one of my favorite authors.
[00:28:57.220 --> 00:28:59.580]   I just got Peter Hamilton's newest, The Great North Road.
[00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:00.580]   Oh.
[00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:01.580]   Yeah.
[00:29:01.580 --> 00:29:03.180]   Who's reading it?
[00:29:03.180 --> 00:29:07.620]   Troy, Toby Longworth, who's reading the evolutionary void?
[00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:08.820]   You're the guy with the same name.
[00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:09.820]   I know.
[00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:10.820]   I love the voice.
[00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:11.820]   What is this?
[00:29:11.820 --> 00:29:12.820]   I listened to it on Audible 2.
[00:29:12.820 --> 00:29:13.820]   The void trilogy is amazing.
[00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:14.820]   That guy.
[00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:15.820]   That guy.
[00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:16.820]   You know that guy with the voice.
[00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:17.820]   He is smooth.
[00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:21.140]   They have some of the best readers in the world.
[00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:22.140]   There it is.
[00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:24.300]   The temporal void, the evolutionary void.
[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:25.300]   The...
[00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:26.300]   John Lee.
[00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:27.300]   That guy.
[00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:28.300]   To a level that would allow her to keep up.
[00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:29.300]   Oh, he's got the screen.
[00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:32.940]   That guy's children, and that was before by anonic argument.
[00:29:32.940 --> 00:29:35.860]   Do you have this experience when you're listening to an audiobook and then you go back and
[00:29:35.860 --> 00:29:38.620]   listen to that same passage, you can remember where you heard it the first time?
[00:29:38.620 --> 00:29:39.620]   Yes.
[00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:40.620]   Is that weird?
[00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:41.620]   Yeah, I tie it.
[00:29:41.620 --> 00:29:42.620]   I think there's something...
[00:29:42.620 --> 00:29:43.620]   There's something going on in the brain.
[00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:44.620]   Yeah.
[00:29:44.620 --> 00:29:45.620]   Because I can...
[00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:46.620]   I was...
[00:29:46.620 --> 00:29:47.620]   The other day I was listening to the audiobooks when I was doing laundry, which I often do
[00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:48.620]   when I'm folding the laundry.
[00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:51.500]   And then I went back and re-listened to it in the car and I was like...
[00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:53.260]   I was there again, folding laundry.
[00:29:53.260 --> 00:29:54.260]   That's a great memory.
[00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:55.420]   Is that the czar?
[00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:56.420]   I know.
[00:29:56.420 --> 00:29:57.420]   I don't understand it.
[00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:58.420]   Anyway.
[00:29:58.420 --> 00:30:00.420]   That's not really a selling point, but...
[00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:01.420]   Yeah.
[00:30:01.420 --> 00:30:02.420]   I was...
[00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:03.420]   Yeah.
[00:30:03.420 --> 00:30:07.940]   But no, I remember what corner, what street corner I was turning on when I...
[00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:08.940]   It's the strangest thing.
[00:30:08.940 --> 00:30:09.940]   I guess there's...
[00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:10.940]   And this is...
[00:30:10.940 --> 00:30:13.060]   Some people get mad at me for calling it reading.
[00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:17.500]   It's the same words that you would get if you read a book, but you're listening and
[00:30:17.500 --> 00:30:21.140]   there's something about the way you consume a book when you're listening.
[00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:22.740]   It becomes...
[00:30:22.740 --> 00:30:24.380]   You ingest it in a different way.
[00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:27.780]   And maybe it's just me, but obviously it's Trey too, but there's something about the way
[00:30:27.780 --> 00:30:30.940]   it gets in your brain where you're just really living the book.
[00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:33.140]   I think that's really part of what it is.
[00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:34.820]   So many great books on here.
[00:30:34.820 --> 00:30:35.820]   Here's a good one.
[00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:36.820]   Alan Bennett, the uncommon reader.
[00:30:36.820 --> 00:30:38.420]   Do you ever listen to any Alan Bennett?
[00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:39.420]   British guy, I'm sure.
[00:30:39.420 --> 00:30:43.340]   Oh no, Alan Bennett stuff on the BBC is wonderful.
[00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:48.500]   I don't know why I said, "Oh" might know it, but for some reason I feel like you do.
[00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:49.940]   How about this?
[00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:51.380]   The guy who did the kite runner.
[00:30:51.380 --> 00:30:52.700]   Do you ever listen to the kite runner?
[00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:54.180]   His new book is coming out.
[00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:59.780]   May 21, Khalid Hosanis and the mountains echoed.
[00:30:59.780 --> 00:31:01.980]   And this is another thing that's great about Audible.
[00:31:01.980 --> 00:31:05.700]   The new books all come out on Audible now, as well as in the bookstores at the same time.
[00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:06.700]   Audible, here's the deal.
[00:31:06.700 --> 00:31:09.060]   Go to audible.com/twit2.
[00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:10.060]   Sign up for the platinum account.
[00:31:10.060 --> 00:31:11.540]   You don't pay anything for the first 30 days.
[00:31:11.540 --> 00:31:12.700]   You get two books free.
[00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:14.420]   Cancel at any time in those first 30 days.
[00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:17.220]   You'll pay nothing, but the books will be yours forever.
[00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:20.300]   As you can see, when you get an Audible subscription, these are...
[00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:21.660]   This is like my entire life.
[00:31:21.660 --> 00:31:23.620]   I own all these books.
[00:31:23.620 --> 00:31:25.580]   I can listen to them anytime.
[00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:27.180]   So many great books.
[00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:28.580]   Audible.com.
[00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:29.580]   Oh, Neil Gaiman.
[00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:30.820]   I got a ton of Neil Gaiman.
[00:31:30.820 --> 00:31:32.380]   I love his stuff.
[00:31:32.380 --> 00:31:37.620]   He's got a whole series on Audible where he's discovering books and having him brought back.
[00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:38.620]   Just great stuff.
[00:31:38.620 --> 00:31:40.380]   Not just his stuff, but other stuff.
[00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:41.860]   Audible.com/twit2.
[00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:43.540]   Highly recommended.
[00:31:43.540 --> 00:31:44.780]   Get the Kingkiller Chronicles.
[00:31:44.780 --> 00:31:45.940]   I'm leveling up.
[00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:46.940]   Yes.
[00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:47.940]   Wonderful.
[00:31:47.940 --> 00:31:48.940]   This is why I listened.
[00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:49.940]   Because you said you can't be my friend unless you like his books.
[00:31:49.940 --> 00:31:50.940]   No, I said your books.
[00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:52.260]   You got some harsh friendship there.
[00:31:52.260 --> 00:31:53.260]   You got rules.
[00:31:53.260 --> 00:31:54.260]   He's tough.
[00:31:54.260 --> 00:31:55.260]   Velvet Hammer.
[00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:56.260]   But you're right.
[00:31:56.260 --> 00:31:58.420]   If you don't like these books, there's something wrong with you.
[00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:01.020]   I would not say anything quite that bombastic.
[00:32:01.020 --> 00:32:02.020]   But...
[00:32:02.020 --> 00:32:06.740]   No, but if you like them, then we're instant friends.
[00:32:06.740 --> 00:32:07.740]   Yeah.
[00:32:07.740 --> 00:32:08.740]   There's something about them.
[00:32:08.740 --> 00:32:10.580]   And Patrick is a wonderful guy.
[00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:11.580]   He's different, isn't he?
[00:32:11.580 --> 00:32:14.780]   Did you meet him before you read the books or after you read the books?
[00:32:14.780 --> 00:32:15.780]   After I read the books.
[00:32:15.780 --> 00:32:16.780]   Yeah.
[00:32:16.780 --> 00:32:17.780]   Yeah.
[00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:18.780]   Yeah.
[00:32:18.780 --> 00:32:21.780]   He's like writing books.
[00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:22.780]   Yeah, he's unpublished.
[00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:23.780]   He's published.
[00:32:23.780 --> 00:32:25.260]   10 years building this world.
[00:32:25.260 --> 00:32:26.260]   Yeah.
[00:32:26.260 --> 00:32:27.900]   And you can tell that there's a lot of depth there.
[00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:28.900]   Mm-hmm.
[00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:29.900]   Yeah.
[00:32:29.900 --> 00:32:30.900]   Wonderful.
[00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:34.180]   Alright, so the other big event of the week was Google I/O.
[00:32:34.180 --> 00:32:35.740]   That's of the past week.
[00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:37.300]   We're going to get to that in a moment.
[00:32:37.300 --> 00:32:39.420]   But you know, this would be a good time to look ahead at the week ahead.
[00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:41.940]   I think Tom Merritt has something for us.
[00:32:41.940 --> 00:32:42.940]   Go ahead, Tom.
[00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:44.540]   Hey Leo, here's a look at the week ahead.
[00:32:44.540 --> 00:32:47.620]   Some of the stories we'll be keeping an eye on for Tech News today.
[00:32:47.620 --> 00:32:50.980]   Of course, starting today is YouTube Comedy Week.
[00:32:50.980 --> 00:32:52.900]   If you don't think it's funny, talk to my wife.
[00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:58.260]   Monday, May 20th, the Asus GTX 670 Direct CU mini graphics card is set to come out at
[00:32:58.260 --> 00:32:59.260]   $399.
[00:32:59.260 --> 00:33:05.100]   Tuesday, May 21st, the Asus transformer book hybrid PC is to be released.
[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:11.580]   Also, the next Gen Xbox official announcement at Microsoft's Redmond campus and probably
[00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:17.580]   riding on that hype, the Razer Atrux Arcade Stick for the Xbox 360 opens pre-orders.
[00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:20.780]   Wednesday, May 22nd, HP has their earnings announcement.
[00:33:20.780 --> 00:33:24.940]   Thursday, May 23rd, the Microsoft Surface Pro goes on sale in the UK.
[00:33:24.940 --> 00:33:29.380]   Also, on Thursday, Salesforce and Pandora announce their earnings.
[00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:34.100]   Friday, May 24th, the Sony Xperia tablet Z is scheduled to ship.
[00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:36.740]   And Saturday, May 25th, big day for geeks.
[00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:40.060]   It's Geek Pride Day, so it's the release of Star Wars.
[00:33:40.060 --> 00:33:43.460]   It's Tal Day and for Terry Pratchett fans.
[00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:46.140]   It's glorious revolution of the 25th of May.
[00:33:46.140 --> 00:33:48.700]   It's all coming up on Saturday.
[00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:49.700]   That's a look at the week ahead.
[00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:50.700]   Back to you, Leo.
[00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:55.660]   You'd think Pratchett, Lucas, and Adams would have gotten together and not had it all be
[00:33:55.660 --> 00:33:57.140]   on the same damn day.
[00:33:57.140 --> 00:34:00.780]   Now you got to wear a towel, a duck.
[00:34:00.780 --> 00:34:01.780]   It's crazy.
[00:34:01.780 --> 00:34:03.900]   Well, anyway, thank you, Tom, Eric.
[00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:09.380]   You can watch TNT Monday through Friday, 10 a.m. Pacific, 1 p.m. Eastern times 1700 UTC
[00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:12.780]   for your daily dose of tech news live.
[00:34:12.780 --> 00:34:16.420]   And we will be doing live coverage of the Microsoft announcement on Tuesday, beginning
[00:34:16.420 --> 00:34:25.020]   at 10 a.m. Pacific, 1700 UTC right here on Twitch.tv, the Xbox Infinity.
[00:34:25.020 --> 00:34:26.420]   It's going to be huge.
[00:34:26.420 --> 00:34:27.420]   Are you excited?
[00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:28.420]   I'm pretty excited.
[00:34:28.420 --> 00:34:29.420]   Yeah.
[00:34:29.420 --> 00:34:30.900]   It's always fun to see what I'm--
[00:34:30.900 --> 00:34:31.900]   I can't wait.
[00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:35.420]   In fact, I've been waiting to decide whether it should get a PlayStation 4 and Xbox next
[00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:37.260]   or whatever they're going to call it.
[00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:38.420]   I'm just waiting there.
[00:34:38.420 --> 00:34:40.460]   Did you see that YouTube video?
[00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:42.740]   And I apologize if you guys already talked about this.
[00:34:42.740 --> 00:34:46.780]   But you know those hippo projectors that 3D map the room and can project on top of the
[00:34:46.780 --> 00:34:47.780]   room?
[00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:48.780]   No.
[00:34:48.780 --> 00:34:49.780]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:34:49.780 --> 00:34:50.780]   Someone knows what I'm talking about, right?
[00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:53.060]   Well, I'm just going to search for a hippo projectors.
[00:34:53.060 --> 00:34:56.820]   I'll see if I could find it, because what they would do is you-- so you're playing the
[00:34:56.820 --> 00:35:01.300]   video game and they project the video game on the outside of the room and they remap
[00:35:01.300 --> 00:35:02.300]   the room.
[00:35:02.300 --> 00:35:03.300]   So you feel like you're actually in it?
[00:35:03.300 --> 00:35:04.300]   It's super immersive.
[00:35:04.300 --> 00:35:07.300]   Yeah, you can see like the shelves and the flowers vibrating every time they're--
[00:35:07.300 --> 00:35:09.100]   Oh, we did try-- when are we talking about this channel?
[00:35:09.100 --> 00:35:10.660]   Was this on one of the shows?
[00:35:10.660 --> 00:35:12.380]   We talked about this on this week in YouTube.
[00:35:12.380 --> 00:35:13.380]   This is so cool.
[00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:14.380]   Yeah.
[00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:15.980]   So you think the Xbox Next will do this?
[00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:16.980]   Well, I don't know.
[00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:18.420]   They got to do something cool.
[00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:19.420]   That would be cool.
[00:35:19.420 --> 00:35:21.220]   I would run out and buy this immediately.
[00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:22.260]   Now, watch this.
[00:35:22.260 --> 00:35:25.820]   When they do this one thing when they take a shot and the whole room vibrates.
[00:35:25.820 --> 00:35:26.820]   Look at that.
[00:35:26.820 --> 00:35:27.820]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:35:27.820 --> 00:35:28.820]   Is that wild?
[00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:31.420]   Because you don't need to have screens everywhere.
[00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:34.940]   There's just enough surfaces if you turn the lights down that you're going to-- you could
[00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:35.940]   put something up there.
[00:35:35.940 --> 00:35:37.500]   They can't just make it higher res.
[00:35:37.500 --> 00:35:38.500]   It's got to have some--
[00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:39.500]   It's immersive.
[00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:40.500]   Immersive.
[00:35:40.500 --> 00:35:41.500]   That might be too much for me.
[00:35:41.500 --> 00:35:43.900]   You think that's expensive?
[00:35:43.900 --> 00:35:45.380]   That's a prototype from Microsoft.
[00:35:45.380 --> 00:35:47.300]   It's got to cost some money.
[00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:48.300]   That's pretty cool.
[00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:50.340]   But we're living an interesting world.
[00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:52.820]   Here you are sitting with a camera on your forehead.
[00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:54.540]   So you know what I mean?
[00:35:54.540 --> 00:35:56.340]   It's more than a camera, I'd like to point out.
[00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:57.340]   What else?
[00:35:57.340 --> 00:35:58.420]   It's directions.
[00:35:58.420 --> 00:35:59.420]   It's searching.
[00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:00.420]   It's email.
[00:36:00.420 --> 00:36:01.420]   It's email.
[00:36:01.420 --> 00:36:02.420]   It's text messaging.
[00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:07.260]   It's really-- continuing my role as the evangelist for Google Glass, even though I don't even
[00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:08.260]   own one.
[00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:10.620]   But it's more than just a camera.
[00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:13.420]   Have you-- you've had it for how long, Trey?
[00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:14.420]   Less than a week.
[00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:15.420]   OK.
[00:36:15.420 --> 00:36:18.300]   So it's too early to say how you're using it, probably.
[00:36:18.300 --> 00:36:24.340]   Yeah, but I-- you know, it's really wonderful getting notifications all the time.
[00:36:24.340 --> 00:36:30.340]   I've taken so many more photos and I'm sharing them a lot privately with my family or just
[00:36:30.340 --> 00:36:31.340]   close friends.
[00:36:31.340 --> 00:36:32.340]   Well, it's cool.
[00:36:32.340 --> 00:36:33.340]   As you travel, your family's in New Zealand.
[00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:34.980]   You can say, hey, here's what I'm looking at.
[00:36:34.980 --> 00:36:35.980]   Here's what's going on.
[00:36:35.980 --> 00:36:36.980]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:40.820]   They say actually in that keynote, this was surprising.
[00:36:40.820 --> 00:36:42.780]   The three and a half hour keynote?
[00:36:42.780 --> 00:36:45.540]   Which they barely mentioned Glass, I might add.
[00:36:45.540 --> 00:36:47.620]   I don't think they mentioned it at all, actually.
[00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:51.100]   But buried in the middle of there, Vic had to sort of throw away line.
[00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:55.500]   But it was that over half of the sharing on Google is not public.
[00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:56.500]   Wow.
[00:36:56.500 --> 00:37:00.460]   And I believe that because I share a lot of stuff just with my friends and family.
[00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:01.460]   It's--
[00:37:01.460 --> 00:37:05.820]   Well, and the way Glass is handling, it's picking up your circles in Google Plus.
[00:37:05.820 --> 00:37:08.340]   And when I was-- I was in Italy, I was using Jason Hal's Glass.
[00:37:08.340 --> 00:37:09.340]   And I took a photo.
[00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:10.500]   And then I said share.
[00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:13.260]   And it was like family, friends, all about Android.
[00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:14.740]   Like he had his circle set.
[00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:18.140]   And it's super easy to pick the right group and share photo.
[00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:20.540]   But they're not great pictures.
[00:37:20.540 --> 00:37:21.540]   I disagree.
[00:37:21.540 --> 00:37:22.380]   Aw, contrary.
[00:37:22.380 --> 00:37:24.820]   You actually posted an HDR from your Glass.
[00:37:24.820 --> 00:37:27.140]   But how much post-processing did you do that make up with it?
[00:37:27.140 --> 00:37:28.060]   Look, I post-processing.
[00:37:28.060 --> 00:37:29.060]   You post-processing.
[00:37:29.060 --> 00:37:30.060]   Unapologetically.
[00:37:30.060 --> 00:37:30.560]   OK.
[00:37:30.560 --> 00:37:32.340]   Yeah, no, I definitely post-processed.
[00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:36.780]   But they're all taken from your upper right eyebrow.
[00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:38.300]   Well, that's where my eye is.
[00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:42.420]   What I'm talking about is sort of a third retina that can capture it.
[00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:43.540]   You're a good photographer.
[00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:46.300]   So no matter what they give you, you're going to get great pictures.
[00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:49.740]   But I would point out that in the hands of somebody like Robert Scobull,
[00:37:49.740 --> 00:37:52.020]   it's a lot of bad snapshots.
[00:37:52.020 --> 00:37:54.860]   Well, you do see a lot of bad snapshots out there for sure.
[00:37:54.860 --> 00:37:57.700]   But you see the same kind of thing with Android phones, don't you?
[00:37:57.700 --> 00:37:58.200]   Yeah.
[00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:00.980]   You see some crappy Android or iPhone shots.
[00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:03.100]   But you see some amazing ones, too.
[00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:04.820]   A robber's a pretty good photographer, though.
[00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:06.460]   And oh, there's Kevin Kelly.
[00:38:06.460 --> 00:38:08.820]   Yeah, he came out to the photo walk.
[00:38:08.820 --> 00:38:10.500]   Now, these look gorgeous.
[00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:11.900]   How much work do you have to do?
[00:38:11.900 --> 00:38:12.780]   Well, very little.
[00:38:12.780 --> 00:38:14.300]   A lot of this just ran through Lightroom.
[00:38:14.300 --> 00:38:16.140]   And it might throw a preset at it.
[00:38:16.140 --> 00:38:17.540]   I have all your presets alone.
[00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:18.220]   Thank you.
[00:38:18.220 --> 00:38:23.060]   I like the photos of you taking a photo with another device.
[00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:23.580]   Yeah.
[00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:26.820]   People seem to like the shots where you've got your hands out there doing something.
[00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:28.580]   Oh, see, the first person.
[00:38:28.580 --> 00:38:29.100]   You're pretty funny.
[00:38:29.100 --> 00:38:33.780]   That's a double in a shower of sunlight with a shirt on, apparently.
[00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:35.100]   Yeah.
[00:38:35.100 --> 00:38:38.980]   Oh, did you see a lot of glass at Google I/O?
[00:38:38.980 --> 00:38:42.260]   There's so much glass all over San Francisco.
[00:38:42.260 --> 00:38:43.020]   Did it bother you?
[00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:46.660]   Nick Bilton was apparently kind of skittish about the whole thing.
[00:38:46.660 --> 00:38:48.180]   I don't go to public urinals.
[00:38:48.180 --> 00:38:49.180]   I don't really know how that works.
[00:38:49.180 --> 00:38:52.380]   What are you doing to pretty pee?
[00:38:52.380 --> 00:38:54.020]   Hey, bring one with you guys.
[00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:55.220]   Have you seen "Dumb and Dumber?"
[00:38:55.220 --> 00:38:57.500]   Remember when they're in that dog car?
[00:38:57.500 --> 00:39:00.260]   I'm going to public urinals.
[00:39:00.260 --> 00:39:04.620]   Well, for those of us who unfortunately don't have our own urinals with us, there were people
[00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:08.220]   in the man's room-- this is what Nick was complaining about.
[00:39:08.220 --> 00:39:09.980]   You have that wink thing on there, right?
[00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:10.980]   The wink I do.
[00:39:10.980 --> 00:39:11.980]   Yeah, I can wink and take a picture.
[00:39:11.980 --> 00:39:12.980]   It's a hack.
[00:39:12.980 --> 00:39:13.980]   It's not really a hack.
[00:39:13.980 --> 00:39:15.780]   It's a side-loaded APK.
[00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:16.780]   Yeah.
[00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:21.180]   And what's weird about Nick Bilton thing is that Nick wrote this book called "I Live
[00:39:21.180 --> 00:39:23.260]   in the Future" and here is how it works.
[00:39:23.260 --> 00:39:29.140]   And he's all about kind of this living in the future.
[00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:34.100]   But his descriptions of these are clearly-- he obviously was unsettled, particularly
[00:39:34.100 --> 00:39:38.820]   the one that struck me was where he was watching a cluster of people who were all staring up
[00:39:38.820 --> 00:39:42.740]   in the sky with their glass, apparently all looking at the same thing.
[00:39:42.740 --> 00:39:45.260]   It was just really creepy to him.
[00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:47.260]   It's a little one of us.
[00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:48.260]   One of us.
[00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:49.740]   Yeah, right, right.
[00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:52.580]   I don't know.
[00:39:52.580 --> 00:39:55.500]   Look, I think this whole thing is inevitable, right?
[00:39:55.500 --> 00:40:01.540]   Like the way we are going, whether this is glass or whatever it becomes in the future,
[00:40:01.540 --> 00:40:02.540]   that's inevitable.
[00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:03.540]   Right.
[00:40:03.540 --> 00:40:10.180]   You know, from whatever little time I spent on the glass, I think it's just we are-- the
[00:40:10.180 --> 00:40:16.980]   glass is where the Apple Newton was in comparison to the iPhone.
[00:40:16.980 --> 00:40:17.980]   Right.
[00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:18.980]   Very, very easy.
[00:40:18.980 --> 00:40:21.820]   I think there's a whole lot of work which needs to happen.
[00:40:21.820 --> 00:40:24.380]   It's an interesting idea.
[00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:30.660]   I applaud Google for actually pursuing this with so much vigor and money.
[00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:33.180]   And you know, something will come out of this.
[00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:37.020]   I don't quite know if this is the precise form factor.
[00:40:37.020 --> 00:40:43.620]   I am very excited about the possibilities of what can be achieved due to wearable computing.
[00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:46.620]   And this is just one manifestation of it.
[00:40:46.620 --> 00:40:47.620]   We shall see.
[00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:53.100]   I did try it for a few minutes, they borrowed it from a friend who had one.
[00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:57.260]   And I had trouble mostly because of my eyesight.
[00:40:57.260 --> 00:41:02.220]   And I couldn't really see much because of the way my eyes are.
[00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:07.020]   And so I had trouble actually trying to even use it just for even the basic tasks and not
[00:41:07.020 --> 00:41:13.580]   even taking pictures just to make sense of the menus and to read the time and everything.
[00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:18.660]   So I'm kind of wondering how I'm going to get and try these out in the future.
[00:41:18.660 --> 00:41:24.380]   You know, it's an extension of what we're already doing, which is carrying around a
[00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:27.420]   little pocket computer that's always connected, it's always got a camera.
[00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:29.580]   The only difference is it's on our face instead of our hands.
[00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:34.020]   But we're already doing, it's really more of a form factor than anything else, right?
[00:41:34.020 --> 00:41:35.500]   And I think we'll see it integrated.
[00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:37.180]   I mean, like, oh, you're wearing glasses.
[00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:42.620]   There's no reason that Google's glass technology can't be integrated into already glasses that
[00:41:42.620 --> 00:41:43.620]   already pre-exist.
[00:41:43.620 --> 00:41:47.180]   We were at, after we did the all about Android last week, Gina and Jason and Chad and I went
[00:41:47.180 --> 00:41:48.180]   out to dinner.
[00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:49.180]   We were talking about it.
[00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:50.180]   We're talking about the price point.
[00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:52.620]   And we're saying, you know, right now it's way too expensive.
[00:41:52.620 --> 00:41:57.900]   But in a year from now when the consumer one, you know, can they keep the price point down
[00:41:57.900 --> 00:41:59.540]   to the point where people want to try it?
[00:41:59.540 --> 00:42:02.340]   And I think in the current model, no, because it just looks so custom.
[00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:04.980]   I think it's all, you know, it's going to be expensive.
[00:42:04.980 --> 00:42:08.820]   If they get it down to $100 and they get it smaller, like you were saying, going to
[00:42:08.820 --> 00:42:12.580]   be less intrusive and less more of this thing hanging off of you, I see it's got legs.
[00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:14.660]   Yeah, I think so too.
[00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:18.500]   I disagree with Om because I think I do think it is a game changer.
[00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:19.700]   It's a totally new category.
[00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:20.700]   It's fun.
[00:42:20.700 --> 00:42:23.940]   It has an inelectable element of fun.
[00:42:23.940 --> 00:42:26.860]   I'm always feeling little vibrations back here and a little ding.
[00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:30.660]   So I know things are incoming and I do not have to go through the trouble of picking
[00:42:30.660 --> 00:42:32.140]   out my phone and looking at it.
[00:42:32.140 --> 00:42:37.940]   And I noticed directions like I was going to Ludo limit in San Francisco and I was looking
[00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:41.140]   at other people staring at their phones while they're trying to find their way.
[00:42:41.140 --> 00:42:45.220]   And I'm just walking like a human through the streets and I have this beautiful overlay.
[00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:46.300]   Don't call it like a human.
[00:42:46.300 --> 00:42:48.060]   You've got a thing on your head.
[00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:49.460]   You're slightly looking forward.
[00:42:49.460 --> 00:42:51.060]   Nothing's human about it.
[00:42:51.060 --> 00:42:52.060]   Okay, well.
[00:42:52.060 --> 00:42:56.140]   But, you know, I, but a lot of class people say that, oh no, this is so much more natural
[00:42:56.140 --> 00:43:00.620]   instead of being emasculating and looking at your phone, you're, but that's not really
[00:43:00.620 --> 00:43:01.620]   any less.
[00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:02.620]   I don't know.
[00:43:02.620 --> 00:43:03.620]   I disagree.
[00:43:03.620 --> 00:43:04.700]   This, that is a little weird though.
[00:43:04.700 --> 00:43:07.940]   Don't, I mean, you kind of get used to watching people walk around like that.
[00:43:07.940 --> 00:43:08.940]   It's terrible.
[00:43:08.940 --> 00:43:11.780]   I mean, I think just because the screen is now, I don't have to look down doesn't mean
[00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:13.780]   you're no longer that you're more connected.
[00:43:13.780 --> 00:43:17.740]   We're going to have glasses look like oh, you know, I wear prescription glasses.
[00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:19.020]   It'll just be in there.
[00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:20.020]   Yeah.
[00:43:20.020 --> 00:43:22.980]   And we can just touch the sides and we can just move our head around to interact and I
[00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:27.620]   mean, the thing we have to recognize is that is that we have a constant stream of information
[00:43:27.620 --> 00:43:31.100]   coming out of us at a daily on an hourly, minutely basis.
[00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:32.100]   We carry our phones.
[00:43:32.100 --> 00:43:33.100]   We carry laptops.
[00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:34.100]   We carry tablets.
[00:43:34.100 --> 00:43:35.100]   We've got Twitter.
[00:43:35.100 --> 00:43:36.100]   We've got Facebook.
[00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:37.100]   We got Google plus.
[00:43:37.100 --> 00:43:38.100]   We've got all these things coming at us.
[00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:40.620]   And it's up to you to decide to take the glasses off.
[00:43:40.620 --> 00:43:42.180]   So if you decide to get the phone down.
[00:43:42.180 --> 00:43:46.620]   And I think etiquette and, you know, the more is a society will determine that.
[00:43:46.620 --> 00:43:48.100]   I'm not too, I'm not unlike Nick.
[00:43:48.100 --> 00:43:49.100]   I'm not too worried.
[00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:51.180]   I'm just going to put it in your head when you go into the bathroom.
[00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:53.060]   Somebody wants to take a picture of my junk.
[00:43:53.060 --> 00:43:54.980]   They're more than welcome to who cares.
[00:43:54.980 --> 00:43:55.980]   I've already did.
[00:43:55.980 --> 00:43:56.980]   It's Tumblr.
[00:43:56.980 --> 00:43:57.980]   It's going to be on Tumblr.
[00:43:57.980 --> 00:44:04.060]   But you're going to see, I mean, like my reaction, you know, and we're all joking about
[00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:06.420]   the video and the hyperbolic reaction.
[00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:09.820]   But, you know, I'm of a generation that grew up being told we were going to have flying
[00:44:09.820 --> 00:44:10.820]   cars like that.
[00:44:10.820 --> 00:44:11.900]   We're going to live in the future.
[00:44:11.900 --> 00:44:13.900]   And honestly, it ain't going to happen by the way.
[00:44:13.900 --> 00:44:15.060]   I don't think that's going to happen.
[00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:19.180]   But this right now was the closest to Star Trek I've seen in my life in my generation.
[00:44:19.180 --> 00:44:21.420]   That was the moment where I was like, oh, wow, this is the future.
[00:44:21.420 --> 00:44:25.820]   I would agree with, uh, home that wearable computing is the future.
[00:44:25.820 --> 00:44:27.060]   Who knows what the form factor is.
[00:44:27.060 --> 00:44:30.100]   This is the Newton, uh, scoble called it the Apple II.
[00:44:30.100 --> 00:44:33.220]   He said the first time I used an Apple II, I saw something was happening.
[00:44:33.220 --> 00:44:34.220]   It was obvious.
[00:44:34.220 --> 00:44:35.900]   And I think that that's probably the case.
[00:44:35.900 --> 00:44:39.340]   And Ken from Chicago in our chat room said there is a difference between holding in your
[00:44:39.340 --> 00:44:40.620]   hand and wearing it on your face.
[00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:44.460]   He says it's like going from a video game that has a hundred millisecond latency to
[00:44:44.460 --> 00:44:45.820]   a once millisecond latency.
[00:44:45.820 --> 00:44:46.820]   It's all about speed.
[00:44:46.820 --> 00:44:47.820]   It's all about it's there.
[00:44:47.820 --> 00:44:48.820]   It's with you.
[00:44:48.820 --> 00:44:49.820]   It's as you're working.
[00:44:49.820 --> 00:44:56.820]   And I love the idea of kind of like, um, the Daniel Suarez, Damon having a heads up view
[00:44:56.820 --> 00:44:59.740]   of people and where I see information about them.
[00:44:59.740 --> 00:45:01.500]   Well, I think about it the practical use.
[00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:03.540]   I mean, we always talk about driving.
[00:45:03.540 --> 00:45:05.340]   And here I was driving over.
[00:45:05.340 --> 00:45:07.180]   I was over in Vacaville and I had to cut over.
[00:45:07.180 --> 00:45:08.180]   I've never been around here.
[00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:09.460]   So I had my phone and I'm driving.
[00:45:09.460 --> 00:45:10.900]   I'm constantly looking at the map for the driving.
[00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:13.980]   If I had glass on, I just had a map in front of me and I'd have to look away from driving.
[00:45:13.980 --> 00:45:14.980]   Yeah.
[00:45:14.980 --> 00:45:15.980]   Then that's might be a little safer.
[00:45:15.980 --> 00:45:16.980]   Yeah.
[00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:17.980]   Yeah.
[00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:19.500]   I think it's probably going to be illegal to wear glass while you're driving.
[00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:20.500]   I might be my guess.
[00:45:20.500 --> 00:45:24.060]   But I hope law enforcement is smart enough to know that it's actually more dangerous
[00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:28.580]   to be looking down in your lap or looking at crappy old GPS system that so many cars
[00:45:28.580 --> 00:45:30.300]   have that are slow at updating.
[00:45:30.300 --> 00:45:36.820]   The National Highway Traffic, the National Highway Transportation Safety Administration,
[00:45:36.820 --> 00:45:37.820]   or HNHSTA.
[00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:41.300]   Click it or tick it.
[00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:47.620]   Has recommendations they say you shouldn't be distracted for more than 12 seconds total
[00:45:47.620 --> 00:45:51.300]   and no more than one or two seconds at a time.
[00:45:51.300 --> 00:45:55.300]   In other words, they say it's okay to look down for one or two seconds, but you should
[00:45:55.300 --> 00:45:57.100]   keep your hands on the wheel and the eyes on the wheel.
[00:45:57.100 --> 00:45:59.500]   This is the recommendation they should say just came out which will probably be somehow
[00:45:59.500 --> 00:46:01.500]   enshrined in law.
[00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:05.340]   And the total distraction shouldn't total more than 12 seconds for any whatever, given
[00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:06.340]   hour.
[00:46:06.340 --> 00:46:11.900]   There's no reason why Google can't work with the traffic and the law to pick up your speed
[00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:13.980]   and limit what functionality the glass has on your brain.
[00:46:13.980 --> 00:46:16.100]   You can't even use a Kindle on an airplane taking off.
[00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:18.740]   I doubt very much they're going to laugh at you.
[00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:21.780]   Your brain is incredibly plastic and I think we are changing.
[00:46:21.780 --> 00:46:22.780]   Our brains are changing.
[00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:24.780]   We're so good at seeing imagery.
[00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:25.780]   Yeah.
[00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:27.700]   You don't even have to really look at it after a while.
[00:46:27.700 --> 00:46:28.700]   It's just kind of the thing.
[00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:30.700]   You're retinating and you just kind of know, okay, I'm going straight.
[00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:31.700]   It looks like I turned it back.
[00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:32.700]   So that's interesting.
[00:46:32.700 --> 00:46:33.700]   I haven't used it enough.
[00:46:33.700 --> 00:46:35.100]   Oh, my only use it for a few minutes.
[00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:36.100]   I haven't used it enough.
[00:46:36.100 --> 00:46:37.100]   You have to keep looking at it all the time.
[00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:38.900]   You have to look over at your console.
[00:46:38.900 --> 00:46:40.740]   But it turns off all the time, doesn't it?
[00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:41.740]   Not when you're doing directions.
[00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:42.740]   Not when you're doing directions.
[00:46:42.740 --> 00:46:43.740]   It stays on.
[00:46:43.740 --> 00:46:45.220]   I think it's fascinating.
[00:46:45.220 --> 00:46:46.220]   I can't wait to see where it goes.
[00:46:46.220 --> 00:46:48.820]   As far as long as you don't go to trip longer than three hours, you'll be fine.
[00:46:48.820 --> 00:46:49.820]   Or to the bathroom.
[00:46:49.820 --> 00:46:50.820]   Or to the bathroom.
[00:46:50.820 --> 00:46:53.220]   Just to make one more point.
[00:46:53.220 --> 00:46:54.220]   Yes.
[00:46:54.220 --> 00:46:58.660]   This is a device which takes attractive people and just makes them on a good basis.
[00:46:58.660 --> 00:46:59.660]   And attractive.
[00:46:59.660 --> 00:47:00.660]   Just make.
[00:47:00.660 --> 00:47:05.780]   It's a very subjective thing, Om.
[00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:10.540]   I actually tried it with three people and they all had the same reaction to it.
[00:47:10.540 --> 00:47:11.540]   Look at Trey.
[00:47:11.540 --> 00:47:13.340]   You can make it look more.
[00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:15.780]   Trey is looking like it to me right now.
[00:47:15.780 --> 00:47:17.380]   Well, and that's the thing.
[00:47:17.380 --> 00:47:22.180]   When I posted that I loved it, one of my friends said it still looks ridiculous.
[00:47:22.180 --> 00:47:23.540]   I said, oh, no, I'm not just agreeing.
[00:47:23.540 --> 00:47:24.540]   I'm not used to it.
[00:47:24.540 --> 00:47:25.540]   Exactly.
[00:47:25.540 --> 00:47:26.540]   You know, you can't use to anything.
[00:47:26.540 --> 00:47:29.540]   I don't think it's.
[00:47:29.540 --> 00:47:30.540]   I think Trey taken off for one minute, please.
[00:47:30.540 --> 00:47:31.540]   Okay.
[00:47:31.540 --> 00:47:32.540]   This is Trey without glass.
[00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:33.540]   Come on.
[00:47:33.540 --> 00:47:34.540]   Look at the guy now.
[00:47:34.540 --> 00:47:35.540]   Nice looking guy.
[00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:37.740]   Got a good smile.
[00:47:37.740 --> 00:47:40.540]   Little crinkle on the eyes.
[00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:41.540]   And now put him on.
[00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:42.540]   Okay.
[00:47:42.540 --> 00:47:44.540]   Now put him on.
[00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:45.540]   Geek.
[00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:46.540]   No, you look, no, you know what?
[00:47:46.540 --> 00:47:47.540]   I'm more scared of you.
[00:47:47.540 --> 00:47:48.860]   You look like Arnold Schwarzenegger.
[00:47:48.860 --> 00:47:50.540]   You look like the Terminator.
[00:47:50.540 --> 00:47:51.540]   Do I have you?
[00:47:51.540 --> 00:47:52.540]   I'm sorry to try.
[00:47:52.540 --> 00:47:53.540]   There you go.
[00:47:53.540 --> 00:47:55.780]   But that's, you know what though?
[00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:57.740]   That's a relevant picture, Chad, just pulled up.
[00:47:57.740 --> 00:48:00.860]   Of the guy from like Wall Street with the big phone.
[00:48:00.860 --> 00:48:01.940]   That's what cell phones look like.
[00:48:01.940 --> 00:48:03.700]   But that doesn't mean they were a bad idea.
[00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:04.700]   Yeah.
[00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:05.700]   They just got better looking.
[00:48:05.700 --> 00:48:06.700]   Right.
[00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:09.300]   No, look, I am not that embarrassed to wear these around.
[00:48:09.300 --> 00:48:10.300]   I would be.
[00:48:10.300 --> 00:48:12.220]   You know, I actually feel okay walking around the streets.
[00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:13.220]   Really?
[00:48:13.220 --> 00:48:14.220]   I'm not so conscious.
[00:48:14.220 --> 00:48:17.780]   Because look, actually when I walk around the streets, people smile.
[00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:18.780]   They're excited.
[00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:19.780]   They like it.
[00:48:19.780 --> 00:48:20.780]   I think I know what that is.
[00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:21.780]   They get really excited.
[00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:22.780]   I've never seen anything like this.
[00:48:22.780 --> 00:48:23.780]   I want to try it on.
[00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:24.780]   They get really excited.
[00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:26.980]   They're like, what is that nerd doing?
[00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:27.980]   It definitely came.
[00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:28.980]   It's not the reaction.
[00:48:28.980 --> 00:48:31.260]   They're like, that is cool.
[00:48:31.260 --> 00:48:35.180]   It definitely caters to the early adopter, the first, you know, kind of the person.
[00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:36.580]   Well, it's 1,500 bucks.
[00:48:36.580 --> 00:48:37.980]   It's ridiculously out of.
[00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:38.980]   I tell you what.
[00:48:38.980 --> 00:48:39.980]   Yeah.
[00:48:39.980 --> 00:48:44.420]   Young people on the street, my age and younger, they generally think that it's very interesting
[00:48:44.420 --> 00:48:46.220]   and cool and they smile.
[00:48:46.220 --> 00:48:49.340]   Older people are like, what's happening to our world?
[00:48:49.340 --> 00:48:50.340]   Don't forget.
[00:48:50.340 --> 00:48:52.140]   Please don't look at me when you say that.
[00:48:52.140 --> 00:48:53.140]   That's so mean.
[00:48:53.140 --> 00:48:54.140]   I definitely don't.
[00:48:54.140 --> 00:48:57.900]   I definitely, I wasn't surprised that I was enthusiastic about it when I remembered that
[00:48:57.900 --> 00:49:00.740]   in sixth grade, I thought it was a good idea to take a briefcase to school.
[00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:01.740]   Right.
[00:49:01.740 --> 00:49:05.460]   So that group of people, this is going to go to and then it will, you know, then it will
[00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:07.740]   get, it will get slimmer, it will get easier and then it will get accepted.
[00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:10.140]   I would immediately accept an object nerve implant.
[00:49:10.140 --> 00:49:11.820]   I would have no trouble about that.
[00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:13.020]   But that's, yeah, that's what I want.
[00:49:13.020 --> 00:49:14.020]   You stay just down the road.
[00:49:14.020 --> 00:49:15.020]   Yeah.
[00:49:15.020 --> 00:49:16.020]   Yeah.
[00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:17.020]   I hope it's before.
[00:49:17.020 --> 00:49:19.580]   So the question is, you know, you're walking around San Francisco or you're walking around
[00:49:19.580 --> 00:49:21.620]   Silicon Valley and you're getting that reaction.
[00:49:21.620 --> 00:49:25.860]   What happens when you're walking in downtown Des Moines, you know, across the street to
[00:49:25.860 --> 00:49:26.860]   the other side?
[00:49:26.860 --> 00:49:30.260]   They say, I don't know what's wrong with that guy, but I'm not walking down the street next
[00:49:30.260 --> 00:49:31.260]   door.
[00:49:31.260 --> 00:49:32.260]   Stuff you stay out of this room.
[00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:39.460]   I haven't tried glass yet, but it's clear to me that it is the next important and evolutionary
[00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:40.460]   step.
[00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:43.220]   And yeah, it's, it's version 1.0 of this.
[00:49:43.220 --> 00:49:48.540]   And I think that society will ultimately, you know, adapt to it and we'll say, oh, you
[00:49:48.540 --> 00:49:50.620]   shouldn't be doing that or you shouldn't be doing that.
[00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:56.620]   The problem, I think where a lot of people are nervous about it is look at how rude etiquette
[00:49:56.620 --> 00:49:58.220]   is around smartphones.
[00:49:58.220 --> 00:50:01.980]   You know, people will stop and look check their smartphone while you're in the middle
[00:50:01.980 --> 00:50:02.980]   of a conversation.
[00:50:02.980 --> 00:50:09.140]   And I think people look at kind of that behavior and say, what kind of rude behaviors will
[00:50:09.140 --> 00:50:12.020]   something like glass bring us?
[00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:15.140]   I don't think people are concerned anymore about people walking down the street.
[00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:18.060]   They don't think it looks weird standing down looking at your smartphone.
[00:50:18.060 --> 00:50:20.580]   I mean, when I see it on the street now, I don't, I don't even know.
[00:50:20.580 --> 00:50:21.580]   I don't notice it.
[00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:25.540]   And so the strangeness of glass just seeing it won't last.
[00:50:25.540 --> 00:50:31.980]   But the concern is if we're giving up our social etiquette for smartphones is this well,
[00:50:31.980 --> 00:50:33.700]   what happens with glass?
[00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:38.420]   I think, you know, one thing I would like to point out that most of these new technologies
[00:50:38.420 --> 00:50:42.180]   get, we get used to them really, really fast.
[00:50:42.180 --> 00:50:48.420]   If they impact us as individuals, I think the biggest challenge with glass is that it
[00:50:48.420 --> 00:50:53.140]   has a bearing on how it interacts with other people.
[00:50:53.140 --> 00:50:58.820]   And I think there is, that is why you will see some sort of, you know, adoption curve,
[00:50:58.820 --> 00:51:04.860]   which will be much, you know, it'll be adoption will be much slower compared to some of the
[00:51:04.860 --> 00:51:06.420]   other technologies.
[00:51:06.420 --> 00:51:08.500]   Because it does impact other people.
[00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:15.580]   You know, the Nick's article in a joke society is actually points to that, that like people
[00:51:15.580 --> 00:51:18.700]   get uncomfortable when technology impacts them.
[00:51:18.700 --> 00:51:24.820]   So it's not, it's not a bad, you know, idea or it's not a bad, you know, direction for
[00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:26.540]   the world of technology.
[00:51:26.540 --> 00:51:31.940]   It just, there is some, some sort of, you know, cash, careful thinking, which is required
[00:51:31.940 --> 00:51:37.140]   as to how we as a society are going to adapt to this and how people are going to adapt
[00:51:37.140 --> 00:51:38.140]   to it.
[00:51:38.140 --> 00:51:42.140]   So that's, I think that is, is how I think about it.
[00:51:42.140 --> 00:51:44.580]   When I think about Google of glass.
[00:51:44.580 --> 00:51:47.940]   And I'm sorry, I was going to say in addition to that, it does impact people.
[00:51:47.940 --> 00:51:51.260]   But it also, I think the next year is going to be the key thing in terms of what applications
[00:51:51.260 --> 00:51:52.740]   get developed for it.
[00:51:52.740 --> 00:51:56.500]   Because those who watch, watch the all of an Android video picked up on the fact that
[00:51:56.500 --> 00:51:58.020]   I said after 10 minutes, I said, okay, great.
[00:51:58.020 --> 00:51:59.020]   Now what?
[00:51:59.020 --> 00:52:00.020]   Yeah.
[00:52:00.020 --> 00:52:01.060]   Like I hit, I hit a wall with it.
[00:52:01.060 --> 00:52:05.100]   And so how do those applications get developed and use the technology and then how does it
[00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:10.100]   impact the way we communicate with people and are we willing to overcome the physical
[00:52:10.100 --> 00:52:13.700]   impediment of this thing on our face in order to stay connected to our family more or stay
[00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:14.700]   connected to work more?
[00:52:14.700 --> 00:52:15.780]   But Trey, you're a photographer.
[00:52:15.780 --> 00:52:18.180]   You probably face this all the time just with a camera.
[00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:21.420]   When you pull up a camera to take a picture of people, people react differently.
[00:52:21.420 --> 00:52:22.420]   Some people get squirrely.
[00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:24.340]   Yeah, there is a certain etiquette.
[00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:25.340]   It's a camera.
[00:52:25.340 --> 00:52:27.220]   There's an etiquette that comes with taking a photo of strangers.
[00:52:27.220 --> 00:52:28.220]   Right.
[00:52:28.220 --> 00:52:29.220]   And I think we can adjust to that.
[00:52:29.220 --> 00:52:33.700]   Either you're socially well adapted and you can, you know, you can still make eye contact
[00:52:33.700 --> 00:52:36.860]   with someone and they know that you're a good-hearted person and, you know, meaning
[00:52:36.860 --> 00:52:37.860]   of any harm.
[00:52:37.860 --> 00:52:39.100]   And it's all right.
[00:52:39.100 --> 00:52:42.940]   You don't, you know, photographers, we don't let technology get in our way of connecting
[00:52:42.940 --> 00:52:44.700]   with another human.
[00:52:44.700 --> 00:52:48.820]   And there's no reason that a little bit of technology can't keep us from being as human
[00:52:48.820 --> 00:52:51.340]   as we ever have been.
[00:52:51.340 --> 00:52:57.020]   I think the biggest announcement, which got kind of underplayed in my mind was hot wording.
[00:52:57.020 --> 00:52:58.780]   And we're going to talk about that.
[00:52:58.780 --> 00:53:00.820]   To me, that was the Star Trek moment.
[00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:03.820]   That was the moment where I said we live in the future.
[00:53:03.820 --> 00:53:05.100]   But we'll talk about that in just a moment.
[00:53:05.100 --> 00:53:06.100]   Great panel.
[00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:09.500]   Oh, Malek from Gigah Ohm, Dwight Silverman from the Houston Chronicle from all about
[00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:13.300]   Android, Ron Richards and Trey Radcliffe stuck in customs.
[00:53:13.300 --> 00:53:16.740]   So if you're not, you like travel everywhere all the time.
[00:53:16.740 --> 00:53:17.980]   Customs doesn't even slow you down.
[00:53:17.980 --> 00:53:20.620]   Currently, actually, I just got rejected from my Chinese visa.
[00:53:20.620 --> 00:53:22.500]   I'm supposed to be in China tomorrow.
[00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:25.180]   So I've never heard of anybody getting rejected.
[00:53:25.180 --> 00:53:27.060]   Yeah, I got rejected three times.
[00:53:27.060 --> 00:53:28.060]   What did they say?
[00:53:28.060 --> 00:53:29.060]   Three times.
[00:53:29.060 --> 00:53:30.500]   Three times twice here in San Francisco.
[00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:32.700]   In fact, Curtis, we met before the show.
[00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:36.460]   He got escorted out of the Chinese consulate.
[00:53:36.460 --> 00:53:37.460]   Was he wearing glass?
[00:53:37.460 --> 00:53:38.460]   No.
[00:53:38.460 --> 00:53:40.700]   I would reject you if you're wearing glass.
[00:53:40.700 --> 00:53:41.700]   No, no, no.
[00:53:41.700 --> 00:53:42.700]   Really?
[00:53:42.700 --> 00:53:43.700]   Yeah, it's been a real problem.
[00:53:43.700 --> 00:53:44.700]   It's hard sometimes.
[00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:45.700]   But I mean, I feel bad.
[00:53:45.700 --> 00:53:46.700]   But you've been in China before.
[00:53:46.700 --> 00:53:47.700]   I've been there several times.
[00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:48.700]   Yeah.
[00:53:48.700 --> 00:53:49.700]   But I feel bad for people.
[00:53:49.700 --> 00:53:50.700]   People have the same problem coming to the US.
[00:53:50.700 --> 00:53:51.700]   They've probably getting visas.
[00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:52.700]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:53:52.700 --> 00:53:53.700]   Viscus are ridiculous.
[00:53:53.700 --> 00:53:54.700]   It's so anachronistic.
[00:53:54.700 --> 00:53:57.860]   Just let countries should just let people move around.
[00:53:57.860 --> 00:53:58.860]   Come on.
[00:53:58.860 --> 00:54:02.060]   Well, I hope you get in because as Dave Bell saying in the chat room, we've been looking
[00:54:02.060 --> 00:54:06.180]   forward to the NEX7 and China experiment.
[00:54:06.180 --> 00:54:10.260]   Ray has temporarily foregone his D1.
[00:54:10.260 --> 00:54:12.260]   No, my Nikon D800.
[00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:13.260]   D800?
[00:54:13.260 --> 00:54:14.260]   Really?
[00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:15.260]   He switched to the D800.
[00:54:15.260 --> 00:54:16.260]   It sounds so behind the terms.
[00:54:16.260 --> 00:54:20.020]   No, I've always used a full-frame Nikon camera, which is a big DSLR.
[00:54:20.020 --> 00:54:23.380]   I wrote an article quite controversial.
[00:54:23.380 --> 00:54:25.060]   Then I'm actually going to switch to this for a month.
[00:54:25.060 --> 00:54:26.060]   And in the beginning of the article...
[00:54:26.060 --> 00:54:29.140]   This is one of those mirrorless APS-C sensors.
[00:54:29.140 --> 00:54:30.140]   This is a Sony NEX.
[00:54:30.140 --> 00:54:33.580]   And actually in the beginning of the article, I said, "Look, Sony's not paying me.
[00:54:33.580 --> 00:54:34.980]   They're not advertising with me.
[00:54:34.980 --> 00:54:37.180]   I paid full price for this thing.
[00:54:37.180 --> 00:54:40.020]   Your life's too short not to use the best."
[00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:45.140]   And I think that I can produce just as good of photos with this as I can in a giant DSLR.
[00:54:45.140 --> 00:54:51.180]   This is exactly 5.9 times smaller than a giant DSLR.
[00:54:51.180 --> 00:54:52.340]   And it can do most everything else.
[00:54:52.340 --> 00:54:54.580]   And you were carrying the giant-est of the giant DSLR.
[00:54:54.580 --> 00:54:57.060]   It was a big son of a gun.
[00:54:57.060 --> 00:54:58.060]   And you...
[00:54:58.060 --> 00:54:59.060]   What lens is that?
[00:54:59.060 --> 00:54:59.900]   This is the new lens.
[00:54:59.900 --> 00:55:02.340]   This is the 10 to 18.
[00:55:02.340 --> 00:55:03.340]   Nice.
[00:55:03.340 --> 00:55:05.340]   On a 1.5...
[00:55:05.340 --> 00:55:06.340]   Oh, very fast.
[00:55:06.340 --> 00:55:07.340]   If you want to get...
[00:55:07.340 --> 00:55:08.340]   Oh, not 1.5.
[00:55:08.340 --> 00:55:09.340]   Not F1.
[00:55:09.340 --> 00:55:10.340]   If you want to get a little geeky.
[00:55:10.340 --> 00:55:13.340]   It actually is 15 to 27 with the crop back.
[00:55:13.340 --> 00:55:14.340]   Normalized.
[00:55:14.340 --> 00:55:15.340]   Yeah.
[00:55:15.340 --> 00:55:16.340]   But it's a wonderful situation.
[00:55:16.340 --> 00:55:17.340]   And...
[00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:20.620]   You've been taking a great bit, but you take great pictures with the 5 megapixel glass.
[00:55:20.620 --> 00:55:21.620]   So...
[00:55:21.620 --> 00:55:23.580]   You can't go wrong.
[00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:25.180]   You can't listen to this guy.
[00:55:25.180 --> 00:55:26.180]   I know.
[00:55:26.180 --> 00:55:27.180]   It's not the cameras of the biography.
[00:55:27.180 --> 00:55:29.620]   I have to take the camera at his recommendation.
[00:55:29.620 --> 00:55:31.780]   It might be good to talk.
[00:55:31.780 --> 00:55:34.140]   You know, I try to use the same pen.
[00:55:34.140 --> 00:55:35.140]   Oh, it does.
[00:55:35.140 --> 00:55:36.140]   But my writing sucks.
[00:55:36.140 --> 00:55:38.540]   I don't understand it.
[00:55:38.540 --> 00:55:40.940]   I'm using the same mic as you and you.
[00:55:40.940 --> 00:55:42.740]   I can't talk that too.
[00:55:42.740 --> 00:55:43.740]   Yeah.
[00:55:43.740 --> 00:55:44.740]   I like to barely understand.
[00:55:44.740 --> 00:55:45.740]   No.
[00:55:45.740 --> 00:55:46.740]   Yeah.
[00:55:46.740 --> 00:55:48.580]   Actually, Ohm is a pretty good photographer.
[00:55:48.580 --> 00:55:50.260]   Ohm.co is blog.
[00:55:50.260 --> 00:55:51.260]   Nice stuff, actually.
[00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:52.260]   Yeah.
[00:55:52.260 --> 00:55:53.260]   It's e-good people.
[00:55:53.260 --> 00:55:54.260]   It's good stuff on Instagram, too.
[00:55:54.260 --> 00:55:55.260]   Yeah.
[00:55:55.260 --> 00:55:56.260]   Yeah.
[00:55:56.260 --> 00:55:57.260]   Yeah.
[00:55:57.260 --> 00:56:01.740]   But, like, I look at what you do, Trey, and I just feel like my life is completely worthless.
[00:56:01.740 --> 00:56:03.340]   Like, what am I trying to buy?
[00:56:03.340 --> 00:56:04.820]   Am I even bothering you?
[00:56:04.820 --> 00:56:05.820]   I give up.
[00:56:05.820 --> 00:56:06.820]   Don't know how to cook or something.
[00:56:06.820 --> 00:56:07.820]   I showed it.
[00:56:07.820 --> 00:56:10.460]   I brought to you by our friends at Citrix.
[00:56:10.460 --> 00:56:15.820]   If you're in the IT biz, if you're the superstar of IT, this is the tool that will help you
[00:56:15.820 --> 00:56:17.020]   go to the next level.
[00:56:17.020 --> 00:56:21.100]   If you've been thinking about perhaps becoming a managed services provider, or if you just
[00:56:21.100 --> 00:56:26.140]   got to do support in an office, software support, you know, problems happen.
[00:56:26.140 --> 00:56:27.780]   Unexpected user issues, Pebcack.
[00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:33.460]   I won't tell you what that is, but the IT pros know what that is.
[00:56:33.460 --> 00:56:34.460]   Serious.
[00:56:34.460 --> 00:56:36.740]   Pebcack, it could be a real problem.
[00:56:36.740 --> 00:56:39.700]   Network and server complications, viruses.
[00:56:39.700 --> 00:56:41.780]   It's also challenging, so stressful.
[00:56:41.780 --> 00:56:44.140]   But go to assist with its three modules.
[00:56:44.140 --> 00:56:45.380]   Come to the rescue.
[00:56:45.380 --> 00:56:49.140]   You've heard about GoToSist Remote Support, the best number one remote support solution
[00:56:49.140 --> 00:56:51.820]   in the world for the last 10 years.
[00:56:51.820 --> 00:56:57.460]   It's fast, easy to use, unattended support, remote support from small devices, support
[00:56:57.460 --> 00:56:58.460]   devices.
[00:56:58.460 --> 00:57:03.500]   Now they've got monitoring, which means you can get in there and you can figure out what's
[00:57:03.500 --> 00:57:09.500]   on that network, everything, hardware, software, everything, and then set up a dashboard that
[00:57:09.500 --> 00:57:13.260]   lets you proactively keep track of what's going on, everything from network performance
[00:57:13.260 --> 00:57:15.620]   to how much space is left on the hard drive.
[00:57:15.620 --> 00:57:21.660]   You get instant messages, emails, text messages, warning you when there's trouble in the offing,
[00:57:21.660 --> 00:57:25.220]   which makes you look like a support hero because you swoop in, you fix it with the remote support.
[00:57:25.220 --> 00:57:26.220]   It's all better.
[00:57:26.220 --> 00:57:31.540]   Nobody knows that you are the king except that everything works just beautifully.
[00:57:31.540 --> 00:57:38.020]   And then the service desk lets you keep track of tickets you can do with changes, installations,
[00:57:38.020 --> 00:57:39.020]   everything's there.
[00:57:39.020 --> 00:57:40.820]   These are three modules, every IT pro needs.
[00:57:40.820 --> 00:57:42.540]   They're all cloud based.
[00:57:42.540 --> 00:57:46.420]   It's very easy to use on any platform for any platform.
[00:57:46.420 --> 00:57:49.980]   And I'm going to get it to you for 30 days free, so that's a pretty good deal.
[00:57:49.980 --> 00:57:51.620]   All three modules.
[00:57:51.620 --> 00:57:54.220]   Make sure you check all three check boxes so you can try them all out.
[00:57:54.220 --> 00:57:59.020]   Go to assist.com, click that green, I can just blue try it free button and use our offer
[00:57:59.020 --> 00:58:00.020]   code TWIT.
[00:58:00.020 --> 00:58:01.860]   Go to assist from Citrix.
[00:58:01.860 --> 00:58:07.860]   It's the IT guy and Gals number one tool ever.
[00:58:07.860 --> 00:58:09.780]   Ever.
[00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:12.660]   So I thought the hot wording was a mind blower.
[00:58:12.660 --> 00:58:14.660]   I'm sitting here feeling like Louis CK.
[00:58:14.660 --> 00:58:18.260]   We're sitting in the future and everybody doesn't even know it.
[00:58:18.260 --> 00:58:21.500]   So I can see there's a little controversy.
[00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:26.540]   It was Google Vice President Joanne, I can't remember the last time, comes on stage.
[00:58:26.540 --> 00:58:31.740]   And without pressing a button, without saying anything, she just says, "Okay Google."
[00:58:31.740 --> 00:58:33.940]   And she explains, "I'm going to go on a trip to Santa Cruz."
[00:58:33.940 --> 00:58:35.260]   So she asks, "What does she say?"
[00:58:35.260 --> 00:58:37.780]   She says, "What's going on in Santa Cruz?"
[00:58:37.780 --> 00:58:39.980]   Show me things to do in Santa Cruz.
[00:58:39.980 --> 00:58:40.980]   "Show me things to do in Santa Cruz."
[00:58:40.980 --> 00:58:41.980]   Boom.
[00:58:41.980 --> 00:58:45.140]   Now I don't think this was canned because right before she did it, she said, "No, I just
[00:58:45.140 --> 00:58:47.700]   got to warn you this is a network-challenged environment.
[00:58:47.700 --> 00:58:50.340]   We just shipped this morning.
[00:58:50.340 --> 00:58:51.820]   So I don't know how well this is going to work well.
[00:58:51.820 --> 00:58:52.820]   I work flawlessly."
[00:58:52.820 --> 00:58:55.380]   After she asked, "What is there to do in Santa Cruz?"
[00:58:55.380 --> 00:58:58.460]   She said, "How do I get there?"
[00:58:58.460 --> 00:59:00.020]   And by the way, Google's talking back to her.
[00:59:00.020 --> 00:59:01.020]   This is on the desktop.
[00:59:01.020 --> 00:59:02.900]   Google's talking back to her.
[00:59:02.900 --> 00:59:07.580]   So there's a nice female voice saying, "It's going to take you two hours and 32 minutes.
[00:59:07.580 --> 00:59:10.180]   You go this way."
[00:59:10.180 --> 00:59:14.940]   Lots of artificial intelligence, context sensitive search.
[00:59:14.940 --> 00:59:19.500]   She says, "My youngest might be too short to ride that wooden rollercoaster, the Big Dipper.
[00:59:19.500 --> 00:59:24.940]   Let me ask, "Hey, Google, how tall do you have to be to ride the Big Dipper?
[00:59:24.940 --> 00:59:26.180]   You must be four foot nine inches."
[00:59:26.180 --> 00:59:28.180]   It was mind boggling.
[00:59:28.180 --> 00:59:31.420]   And it's funny that you're reacting so strongly to it because I wasn't that surprised.
[00:59:31.420 --> 00:59:34.580]   One of our predictions on all about Android was that we were going to see more integration
[00:59:34.580 --> 00:59:36.780]   of Google Now-esque functionality.
[00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:41.180]   Yeah, some of the results were knowledge graph or Google Now style cards.
[00:59:41.180 --> 00:59:42.180]   Exactly.
[00:59:42.180 --> 00:59:47.700]   So now for those who don't know, is the Siri application that came out with the latest
[00:59:47.700 --> 00:59:48.700]   version of the Android--
[00:59:48.700 --> 00:59:49.700]   It's not bragpled out.
[00:59:49.700 --> 00:59:51.260]   I can officially say kick series, but--
[00:59:51.260 --> 00:59:52.260]   It's secure.
[00:59:52.260 --> 00:59:53.260]   It's awesome.
[00:59:53.260 --> 00:59:54.260]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:59:54.260 --> 00:59:57.420]   Because not only is it an entry point to talk to your phone or now to your desktop and
[00:59:57.420 --> 01:00:01.260]   get search results, but it preemptively gives you information based off what you search for
[01:00:01.260 --> 01:00:02.260]   what you're looking for.
[01:00:02.260 --> 01:00:06.620]   So for example, today, I just Googled quickly the directions to here and then on my desktop
[01:00:06.620 --> 01:00:10.260]   and then I go on my phone and it's already got a card on the directions to it.
[01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:11.260]   And it just works.
[01:00:11.260 --> 01:00:15.340]   I knew-- I didn't know for a fact, but I was pretty sure that we're going to start seeing
[01:00:15.340 --> 01:00:16.900]   that move to the desktop.
[01:00:16.900 --> 01:00:21.020]   And it was really elegant, especially after they had that demo fail with the connect video
[01:00:21.020 --> 01:00:22.300]   game stuff.
[01:00:22.300 --> 01:00:26.300]   The fact that it was live and worked, proved that it was in a live environment and it was
[01:00:26.300 --> 01:00:28.540]   solid, it's solid.
[01:00:28.540 --> 01:00:32.580]   I feel like that is the future of search, but I could see how some people might be nervous
[01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:36.140]   because I guess the browser is listening to everything you say, right?
[01:00:36.140 --> 01:00:38.980]   Waiting for OK Google, just like you say OK Glass.
[01:00:38.980 --> 01:00:39.980]   Yeah.
[01:00:39.980 --> 01:00:40.980]   It was amazing.
[01:00:40.980 --> 01:00:42.700]   And it's being at Google Now.
[01:00:42.700 --> 01:00:43.700]   That's even in here.
[01:00:43.700 --> 01:00:44.700]   Yeah, you haven't--
[01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:45.700]   I could swipe those cards.
[01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:47.340]   I came out of Moscone Center.
[01:00:47.340 --> 01:00:48.700]   It knew it was dinner time.
[01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:49.700]   Yeah.
[01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:51.940]   And it suggested five sushi restaurants.
[01:00:51.940 --> 01:00:54.380]   It knows I like sushi.
[01:00:54.380 --> 01:00:56.060]   And they were all in walking distance.
[01:00:56.060 --> 01:00:58.980]   It was eerie, but awesome eerie.
[01:00:58.980 --> 01:01:03.260]   It's the potential of the-- it's the potential of the search results that we've been putting
[01:01:03.260 --> 01:01:04.620]   into Google for what now?
[01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:05.620]   10 plus years?
[01:01:05.620 --> 01:01:09.540]   When I got Google Now for the first time, the first time I opened it up, the first card
[01:01:09.540 --> 01:01:11.260]   was the Met's score.
[01:01:11.260 --> 01:01:15.300]   It knew I was a Met's fan from just by my years of searching for buying tickets and things
[01:01:15.300 --> 01:01:16.300]   like that.
[01:01:16.300 --> 01:01:19.940]   And then the further integration-- people get freaked out by this, but this is the way
[01:01:19.940 --> 01:01:21.700]   we make technology work for us.
[01:01:21.700 --> 01:01:24.820]   In Gmail, you get a shipping notification from UPS.
[01:01:24.820 --> 01:01:27.900]   And Google Now gives you a card of what the status of your package is.
[01:01:27.900 --> 01:01:29.900]   It's that preemptive giving you what you want.
[01:01:29.900 --> 01:01:32.980]   That's what Google's-- the promise has been is that we're going to index the world's information
[01:01:32.980 --> 01:01:36.420]   and serve it to you in a great way that allows you to be more productive.
[01:01:36.420 --> 01:01:37.420]   It's awesome.
[01:01:37.420 --> 01:01:40.420]   They said the end of search as we know it, because this isn't search anymore.
[01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:42.820]   This is prediction almost.
[01:01:42.820 --> 01:01:48.980]   So we've got this new voice search, but we've also got now, which is prediction.
[01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:49.980]   I was impressed.
[01:01:49.980 --> 01:01:50.980]   But again, let me ask.
[01:01:50.980 --> 01:01:55.940]   Maybe, Oum, you can represent the scared people.
[01:01:55.940 --> 01:02:00.420]   Do you worry about Google Now hearing everything you say or the voice search hearing everything
[01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:01.860]   you say, hot wording?
[01:02:01.860 --> 01:02:03.660]   You mean to say they don't listen to us?
[01:02:03.660 --> 01:02:04.660]   Oh, that's right.
[01:02:04.660 --> 01:02:07.660]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:02:07.660 --> 01:02:12.500]   I mean, between Google and Facebook, I'm not sure whatever happens to our web is not known
[01:02:12.500 --> 01:02:13.500]   already.
[01:02:13.500 --> 01:02:16.300]   I think the board has already sailed.
[01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:22.620]   What we don't like is the perception of this privacy we have that being eroded away.
[01:02:22.620 --> 01:02:24.740]   I think that's the reality.
[01:02:24.740 --> 01:02:31.220]   And I think the Google Now is a good-- again, like Google Glass, it's a great first step
[01:02:31.220 --> 01:02:39.380]   towards that our voice interaction, our direct interaction with this computer in the sky.
[01:02:39.380 --> 01:02:43.820]   And I think it's a great-- again, it's like the first step.
[01:02:43.820 --> 01:02:51.620]   We have a lot more work to do before it gets really, really, really good and useful for
[01:02:51.620 --> 01:02:52.620]   us.
[01:02:52.620 --> 01:02:59.300]   I think one of the things which I wrote about as subsequent to my visit to the keynote was
[01:02:59.300 --> 01:03:06.580]   that what Google is doing is defining experiences by using data.
[01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:12.100]   And what that might mean is that they were-- they're defining how we do or we consume
[01:03:12.100 --> 01:03:17.540]   search by how we have used search and what we have searched for.
[01:03:17.540 --> 01:03:21.500]   And I think that is the right way of designing applications in the future.
[01:03:21.500 --> 01:03:23.180]   So they're on the right track.
[01:03:23.180 --> 01:03:28.740]   I'm actually pretty excited about what can happen in the future from Google.
[01:03:28.740 --> 01:03:35.260]   I do know that they are less likely to do nefarious things compared to the other guys
[01:03:35.260 --> 01:03:41.660]   and the other big guys, like the Facebook I don't trust very much, mostly because they
[01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:49.540]   start from-- they start with the idea that they will mess with the privacy of the consumer.
[01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:58.580]   Whereas Google still has some qualities left which they don't want to screw you over,
[01:03:58.580 --> 01:03:59.580]   completely sorry.
[01:03:59.580 --> 01:04:03.580]   I get that feeling too, but I hope that we're right.
[01:04:03.580 --> 01:04:08.300]   Well, one of the things that I think the creepy factor comes a lot of times from a lack
[01:04:08.300 --> 01:04:11.260]   of transparency as to why something is happening.
[01:04:11.260 --> 01:04:14.980]   So for example, I love Google Now on my iPhone.
[01:04:14.980 --> 01:04:17.220]   It's just I use it all the time.
[01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:21.260]   And the other day I came home on a Thursday and I got out of the car and I checked Google
[01:04:21.260 --> 01:04:26.860]   Now and it gave me the preview for that night's Grey's Anatomy.
[01:04:26.860 --> 01:04:30.580]   Grey's Anatomy is like my dirty little secret of television watching that I like.
[01:04:30.580 --> 01:04:32.540]   I'm out of it.
[01:04:32.540 --> 01:04:35.540]   And how did it know I like Grey's Anatomy?
[01:04:35.540 --> 01:04:38.100]   Well, I've mentioned it once in a blog post.
[01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:40.380]   Did Google like pick it up from a blog post?
[01:04:40.380 --> 01:04:41.380]   I don't Google.
[01:04:41.380 --> 01:04:43.460]   I don't search Grey's Anatomy.
[01:04:43.460 --> 01:04:45.180]   How did it know that?
[01:04:45.180 --> 01:04:48.100]   And there was no indication where that came from.
[01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:53.740]   And I think people would feel more comfortable with some of the aspects of Google Now and
[01:04:53.740 --> 01:04:59.100]   what they're doing if there was more transparency as to the source of the information.
[01:04:59.100 --> 01:05:03.740]   Well I don't think that people get tripped up by the lack of transparency or stuff like
[01:05:03.740 --> 01:05:05.980]   that because Google Now hit a home run for you.
[01:05:05.980 --> 01:05:06.980]   You like the TV show.
[01:05:06.980 --> 01:05:12.260]   If you get value, I think you guys are it seems to me I'm noticing because I don't it
[01:05:12.260 --> 01:05:14.100]   doesn't bother me but I do worry about it.
[01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:15.580]   That wasn't a home run for me.
[01:05:15.580 --> 01:05:17.100]   That was like being like where that comes from.
[01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:19.260]   Right of the head by a wild pig.
[01:05:19.260 --> 01:05:20.260]   Yeah.
[01:05:20.260 --> 01:05:23.540]   Well, I mean, I think the comparison is that what do we see from Siri?
[01:05:23.540 --> 01:05:25.740]   We've seen look how Siri got this wrong.
[01:05:25.740 --> 01:05:26.740]   Right.
[01:05:26.740 --> 01:05:28.740]   Like that's all we never see how Siri got right.
[01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:29.740]   Right.
[01:05:29.740 --> 01:05:31.380]   Siri is in big trouble with what they are doing.
[01:05:31.380 --> 01:05:32.380]   I mean, how this is huge.
[01:05:32.380 --> 01:05:33.380]   It's just like maps.
[01:05:33.380 --> 01:05:34.380]   Yeah.
[01:05:34.380 --> 01:05:38.260]   Apple may as well, you know, Apple either has to deliver its own home run or they've got
[01:05:38.260 --> 01:05:40.220]   serious, they have Siri problems.
[01:05:40.220 --> 01:05:45.700]   I got the strongest sense at this Google I/O as long as it was that what we had been
[01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:51.060]   watching for the last few years was building a foundation and maybe apparent until you
[01:05:51.060 --> 01:05:55.260]   unless you were really smart like home wasn't apparent what the foundation was.
[01:05:55.260 --> 01:05:58.660]   But now that I actually mentioned this to Bradley Horwis as I was leaving now it feels
[01:05:58.660 --> 01:06:02.260]   like the pieces are clicking into place and we're starting to see the outlines of the
[01:06:02.260 --> 01:06:07.860]   edifice where you're tying search into now and Google plus into this and everything seems
[01:06:07.860 --> 01:06:13.140]   to be unifying into a structure that really seems to work quite well and it feels to me
[01:06:13.140 --> 01:06:18.460]   like a train slowly leaving the station that it's going to be harder and harder for Facebook
[01:06:18.460 --> 01:06:23.340]   and Apple and Microsoft and Amazon to keep up because Google's been building this up
[01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:24.340]   for so long.
[01:06:24.340 --> 01:06:28.580]   They've been building up this head of steam and now they're starting to move and it's
[01:06:28.580 --> 01:06:29.580]   going to be too late.
[01:06:29.580 --> 01:06:33.740]   Apple, you know, maps is a very good example of Apple missing the boat, not understanding
[01:06:33.740 --> 01:06:38.220]   that Google's put 10 years into this and you can't just march right in and do it.
[01:06:38.220 --> 01:06:39.220]   And I-
[01:06:39.220 --> 01:06:44.180]   Facebook has tried to do this with its graph search and if you've used that search, that
[01:06:44.180 --> 01:06:50.340]   new search feature, it doesn't do 90% of the time what Facebook says it will do.
[01:06:50.340 --> 01:06:56.820]   It's pretty much just a search for your friends and nobody yet I think has come up with any
[01:06:56.820 --> 01:07:02.580]   kind of search or delivery of information because yeah, traditional search is dead with
[01:07:02.580 --> 01:07:04.300]   what Google's doing.
[01:07:04.300 --> 01:07:09.100]   No one has come up with the delivery of information system yet that's as good as what Google has.
[01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:10.100]   And I think-
[01:07:10.100 --> 01:07:11.100]   Go ahead on.
[01:07:11.100 --> 01:07:12.660]   Let me interrupt for one minute.
[01:07:12.660 --> 01:07:20.620]   My point in this debate is that a lot of us have overlooked what Google has been doing
[01:07:20.620 --> 01:07:27.300]   for a very long time which is spending close to 500 to 800 million dollars every three
[01:07:27.300 --> 01:07:33.980]   months on building its infrastructure which is its data centers, its fiber networks, its
[01:07:33.980 --> 01:07:36.620]   own switches, its own server.
[01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:42.700]   You know, basically building this giant computer which can actually do all these things.
[01:07:42.700 --> 01:07:43.700]   There is-
[01:07:43.700 --> 01:07:46.900]   You know, it's not- you can't build all that overnight.
[01:07:46.900 --> 01:07:49.500]   You know, Facebook now has two data centers.
[01:07:49.500 --> 01:07:53.620]   Apple has two data centers but it's not the same thing.
[01:07:53.620 --> 01:07:59.380]   Having as much compute resources today is not- it's not going to be easy for these people
[01:07:59.380 --> 01:08:00.780]   to catch up with that.
[01:08:00.780 --> 01:08:05.820]   The reason you can get Google now results at line speed, essentially the minute you ask
[01:08:05.820 --> 01:08:13.620]   the question or even it pops up on your phone is because Google has installed these massive
[01:08:13.620 --> 01:08:19.420]   machines and they are sitting in the last mile, you know, what do you call the central
[01:08:19.420 --> 01:08:25.940]   offices or connecting with carrier networks at such- at closest to the consumer so which
[01:08:25.940 --> 01:08:28.420]   brings their results much faster.
[01:08:28.420 --> 01:08:34.860]   You know, behind this beautiful edifice we have of Android and iOS, there is a- you know,
[01:08:34.860 --> 01:08:39.940]   there is a very complicated piece of technology which is still underlying which makes the
[01:08:39.940 --> 01:08:45.380]   whole thing work and they have built the best underlying machine in the world and I'm spending
[01:08:45.380 --> 01:08:50.660]   money on that is the main reason they are able to do it and I think we cannot underscore
[01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:51.860]   that aspect of it.
[01:08:51.860 --> 01:08:55.460]   So it doesn't matter, you know, what people are missing.
[01:08:55.460 --> 01:09:02.980]   I think that's the- this- I wrote this post like in 2008 to 2009 which- which basically
[01:09:02.980 --> 01:09:09.840]   talked about Google's, you know, infrastructure was its strategic, you know, weapon and I
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:15.580]   remember meeting Larry and Sergey back in the day essentially before they even launched
[01:09:15.580 --> 01:09:20.940]   and they showed me their deck as to what the company's vision was and the vision included
[01:09:20.940 --> 01:09:25.860]   building this giant compute network of their own which spread worldwide.
[01:09:25.860 --> 01:09:31.580]   I mean, there's not very many people would think about where they're going in 15, 20
[01:09:31.580 --> 01:09:38.500]   years as clearly as they did and the infrastructure part of it is very crucial and I think that's
[01:09:38.500 --> 01:09:41.340]   the biggest reason they're able to do Google's lives.
[01:09:41.340 --> 01:09:45.700]   I mean, what you're seeing on the front end, the consumer end of things is just what they've
[01:09:45.700 --> 01:09:48.380]   been able to do at the infrastructure level.
[01:09:48.380 --> 01:09:54.940]   I think that's the hidden Google nobody really sees and even this is the same area you used
[01:09:54.940 --> 01:10:00.140]   to get Walsford people, you know, complaining about why Google shouldn't be spending this
[01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:05.100]   much money on infrastructure and hardware and all these other things and like why not?
[01:10:05.100 --> 01:10:06.940]   Like now you know why not.
[01:10:06.940 --> 01:10:12.060]   Well, in more than building the infrastructure, they've also been collecting the data.
[01:10:12.060 --> 01:10:18.740]   So things like remember Google for one one, which very famously was collecting a lot
[01:10:18.740 --> 01:10:22.700]   of voice samples so that their voice recognition could be better.
[01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:24.940]   They've been collecting so much data.
[01:10:24.940 --> 01:10:28.900]   They've got these infrastructure so they can store it and process it.
[01:10:28.900 --> 01:10:33.820]   They've effectively built a giant neural network, I would guess.
[01:10:33.820 --> 01:10:34.820]   I mean, there's SkyNet.
[01:10:34.820 --> 01:10:39.300]   Well, it's not got too candid to it.
[01:10:39.300 --> 01:10:43.980]   No, but it's because it's exactly what you said, which is because they had the vision
[01:10:43.980 --> 01:10:46.380]   to build the network, collect the data.
[01:10:46.380 --> 01:10:51.900]   Now we're seeing the fruits of that process and it's 10 years ahead of where anybody who
[01:10:51.900 --> 01:10:53.780]   suddenly goes, oh, we ought to do that.
[01:10:53.780 --> 01:10:54.780]   Well, good luck.
[01:10:54.780 --> 01:10:55.780]   We'll see in 10 years.
[01:10:55.780 --> 01:11:00.620]   I mean, I think all of Olm's points are true, but factor in also the recent management changes
[01:11:00.620 --> 01:11:04.260]   by Larry Page and a focusing of what they do.
[01:11:04.260 --> 01:11:09.180]   We've seen for years under Eric Schmidt and before that the whole 80/20, how Google employees
[01:11:09.180 --> 01:11:12.500]   work on personal projects, 20% time, that's how we got these cool things come up.
[01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:15.940]   Larry Page locked it down and said, no, these are what we need to do.
[01:11:15.940 --> 01:11:18.300]   And now we're seeing all the benefit of that.
[01:11:18.300 --> 01:11:20.260]   We're seeing a consistent design approach.
[01:11:20.260 --> 01:11:22.780]   We're seeing commonality across the applications.
[01:11:22.780 --> 01:11:23.780]   We're seeing shutting down.
[01:11:23.780 --> 01:11:26.940]   We're all complaining about Google Reader shutting down, but Google Plus is going to
[01:11:26.940 --> 01:11:29.500]   be that much stronger, better for it.
[01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:32.540]   So Olm, do you think they planned this from day one?
[01:11:32.540 --> 01:11:37.540]   Well, I do know that they knew the importance of infrastructure from day one.
[01:11:37.540 --> 01:11:38.540]   Yeah.
[01:11:38.540 --> 01:11:40.540]   Well, they couldn't scale the search by itself.
[01:11:40.540 --> 01:11:41.540]   They couldn't scale the search.
[01:11:41.540 --> 01:11:42.540]   Yeah.
[01:11:42.540 --> 01:11:46.180]   I think this is just where, look, I think you were calling it the neural network.
[01:11:46.180 --> 01:11:51.820]   I think it, yes, it's a neural network from, if this was an amoeba, right?
[01:11:51.820 --> 01:11:55.180]   I think we are that early stage of understanding.
[01:11:55.180 --> 01:11:59.580]   I think this is why we kind of have to put everything in context.
[01:11:59.580 --> 01:12:06.980]   This is why I think all the media and bloggers, and we can't get too upset about a lot of
[01:12:06.980 --> 01:12:12.140]   things, but we also have to be very careful about the privacy, like what these companies
[01:12:12.140 --> 01:12:18.420]   do, company like Google, as it becomes more powerful, we need to know what we should be,
[01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:22.940]   how we should be looking at them, and how we should be looking to cover them, and thinking
[01:12:22.940 --> 01:12:30.020]   about them in a contextual manner, so that they don't try and steamroll our human beings
[01:12:30.020 --> 01:12:33.140]   actually like to live and do certain things.
[01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:39.780]   Well, it's our job rapidly becomes, continue to press Google to do the right thing and
[01:12:39.780 --> 01:12:41.980]   say, hey, we're paying attention.
[01:12:41.980 --> 01:12:42.980]   We may celebrate this.
[01:12:42.980 --> 01:12:47.780]   We may be excited by hot wording, but we also are aware of the downside and we're going
[01:12:47.780 --> 01:12:48.780]   to pay attention.
[01:12:48.780 --> 01:12:49.780]   We're going to keep you honest.
[01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:52.300]   I think that's the right job for the Fourth Estate.
[01:12:52.300 --> 01:12:54.820]   You know what one of the government anymore, it's Google.
[01:12:54.820 --> 01:12:59.300]   Well, to that point, I think one of the announcements that happened at I/O that really didn't get
[01:12:59.300 --> 01:13:03.700]   that much attention or play by the press has been the simple Google Wallet integration with
[01:13:03.700 --> 01:13:04.700]   Gmail.
[01:13:04.700 --> 01:13:05.900]   Did you say you can mail money?
[01:13:05.900 --> 01:13:07.340]   Yeah, just send money.
[01:13:07.340 --> 01:13:09.860]   I don't know if it's the carriers.
[01:13:09.860 --> 01:13:10.980]   I think it is the carriers.
[01:13:10.980 --> 01:13:13.220]   I cannot get wallet working on any of my phones.
[01:13:13.220 --> 01:13:14.220]   Well, I love wallet.
[01:13:14.220 --> 01:13:15.220]   What phone do you have?
[01:13:15.220 --> 01:13:16.220]   Is it Nexus 4?
[01:13:16.220 --> 01:13:17.700]   Because it won't work on the HTC.
[01:13:17.700 --> 01:13:20.100]   You know, it's blocked by the carrier on the HTC One.
[01:13:20.100 --> 01:13:21.260]   It's blocked in the Galaxy S4.
[01:13:21.260 --> 01:13:23.140]   So you're saying, which carrier?
[01:13:23.140 --> 01:13:24.140]   I'm on T-Mobile.
[01:13:24.140 --> 01:13:25.140]   I'm on T-Mobile.
[01:13:25.140 --> 01:13:26.140]   So maybe Samsung is blocked.
[01:13:26.140 --> 01:13:27.140]   T-Mobile is the Nexus 4.
[01:13:27.140 --> 01:13:28.140]   No problem.
[01:13:28.140 --> 01:13:31.860]   Gina was cracking up because I drove Gina up to the brick house to do all that Android
[01:13:31.860 --> 01:13:35.020]   and she was laughing because I used the zip car app to get a zip car and then we got
[01:13:35.020 --> 01:13:37.020]   in the car and we drove up and we stopped at the 7-Eleven.
[01:13:37.020 --> 01:13:38.020]   You don't have any money?
[01:13:38.020 --> 01:13:39.620]   You don't even want to get a Snapple.
[01:13:39.620 --> 01:13:40.620]   Yeah, it's great.
[01:13:40.620 --> 01:13:41.620]   So they accept Bitcoin.
[01:13:41.620 --> 01:13:42.620]   We can get the government out entirely.
[01:13:42.620 --> 01:13:43.620]   Yeah.
[01:13:43.620 --> 01:13:50.660]   And this is a leaked screenshot of what we, what some think Flickr will announce tomorrow.
[01:13:50.660 --> 01:13:56.300]   This is what somebody has leaked out as was in the beta apparently as, what do you think,
[01:13:56.300 --> 01:14:00.860]   Trey, of potential new look for Flickr, very much more Pinterest-y.
[01:14:00.860 --> 01:14:04.780]   Yes, we just don't know where this screenshot came from.
[01:14:04.780 --> 01:14:06.500]   It couldn't come from anywhere.
[01:14:06.500 --> 01:14:07.740]   Not me, by the way.
[01:14:07.740 --> 01:14:08.740]   Yahoo.
[01:14:08.740 --> 01:14:11.180]   No, I'm showing it on my screen though so you can, you can talk about it.
[01:14:11.180 --> 01:14:16.220]   So it looks to me like a total redesign.
[01:14:16.220 --> 01:14:18.660]   Even though Flickr didn't have a restart.
[01:14:18.660 --> 01:14:21.820]   You still see you contacts groups and explore at the top.
[01:14:21.820 --> 01:14:22.820]   Yeah.
[01:14:22.820 --> 01:14:23.820]   That hasn't changed.
[01:14:23.820 --> 01:14:29.020]   Now I think they're feeling the pressure from 500px and Google+ and places where the
[01:14:29.020 --> 01:14:32.900]   photos get bigger and all the other information gets out of the way.
[01:14:32.900 --> 01:14:34.460]   So here the picture looks huge.
[01:14:34.460 --> 01:14:40.980]   It was like there's a focus on the stream and your community.
[01:14:40.980 --> 01:14:41.980]   It looks better.
[01:14:41.980 --> 01:14:47.020]   I would say it's not groundbreaking but I would say it's an iterative step in the right direction.
[01:14:47.020 --> 01:14:49.660]   I want to ask you about Google+ there was a redesign there.
[01:14:49.660 --> 01:14:50.660]   There's a new maps.
[01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:52.660]   There's a lot to talk about still.
[01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:56.060]   And then we really do have to talk about Larry Page.
[01:14:56.060 --> 01:14:59.060]   And he took the stage.
[01:14:59.060 --> 01:15:04.180]   He said some very provocative things and I'd like to know what you all think about that.
[01:15:04.180 --> 01:15:05.420]   So we will do that in a little bit.
[01:15:05.420 --> 01:15:10.060]   You're watching this week in tech and that's a great week for tech.
[01:15:10.060 --> 01:15:15.220]   I'll tell you with Om Malek, Trey Radcliffe, Ron Richards and Dwight Silverman.
[01:15:15.220 --> 01:15:17.700]   I'm glad we got a big panel because there's a lot to talk about.
[01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:20.660]   Our show today brought to you by a company that I'm kind of excited about.
[01:15:20.660 --> 01:15:21.660]   This is a new idea.
[01:15:21.660 --> 01:15:23.620]   I bet you worked at Accenture.
[01:15:23.620 --> 01:15:26.940]   You were a management consultant, right?
[01:15:26.940 --> 01:15:28.460]   Is that what you did?
[01:15:28.460 --> 01:15:32.900]   I did more technology implementation, programming and technical architecture.
[01:15:32.900 --> 01:15:38.020]   You were like the nerd in House of Lies.
[01:15:38.020 --> 01:15:39.300]   You were like the Harvard guy, right?
[01:15:39.300 --> 01:15:40.300]   You ever see that show?
[01:15:40.300 --> 01:15:41.300]   I don't know the reference.
[01:15:41.300 --> 01:15:43.820]   Oh man, it's a show about management consultants with Don Cheadle.
[01:15:43.820 --> 01:15:44.820]   It's awesome.
[01:15:44.820 --> 01:15:45.820]   I like Don Cheadle.
[01:15:45.820 --> 01:15:46.820]   I like that sentence.
[01:15:46.820 --> 01:15:48.100]   It's a show about management consultants.
[01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:49.100]   It's awesome.
[01:15:49.100 --> 01:15:51.660]   It's the funniest show you've ever seen.
[01:15:51.660 --> 01:15:53.260]   It's the funniest show you've ever seen.
[01:15:53.260 --> 01:15:54.700]   And it's all about how they come in.
[01:15:54.700 --> 01:15:57.380]   Anyway, it's all about the spreadsheets, the charts.
[01:15:57.380 --> 01:16:01.100]   And one of the things I've learned that nowadays big business has access to something
[01:16:01.100 --> 01:16:05.500]   called BI, business intelligence, that is transforming business because they've got
[01:16:05.500 --> 01:16:08.020]   all the data, but they never knew what to do with it.
[01:16:08.020 --> 01:16:11.860]   They were always reacting, never planning, never preparing.
[01:16:11.860 --> 01:16:15.060]   And now a big company's got business intelligence that's really changing the world.
[01:16:15.060 --> 01:16:18.940]   This is a company, some all, that wants to make this kind of connected insight available
[01:16:18.940 --> 01:16:24.020]   to everybody, to you, to me, to everybody for free right now.
[01:16:24.020 --> 01:16:25.740]   I'm not sure what their model is.
[01:16:25.740 --> 01:16:29.180]   Dane Atkinson, who was one of the founders of Squarespace, has been a friend of this
[01:16:29.180 --> 01:16:31.900]   network for a long time and is a great guy, started this.
[01:16:31.900 --> 01:16:35.420]   It's called some all, S-U-M-A-L-L.
[01:16:35.420 --> 01:16:39.660]   Now they do have a price on the page, but they're not going to charge you because the
[01:16:39.660 --> 01:16:42.460]   idea is, you know, I don't even know how to describe this.
[01:16:42.460 --> 01:16:43.980]   Let's go back to the home and see if we can...
[01:16:43.980 --> 01:16:44.980]   It looks beautiful.
[01:16:44.980 --> 01:16:47.220]   Well, what it is, is it's going to take analytics.
[01:16:47.220 --> 01:16:49.180]   You need this, Trey.
[01:16:49.180 --> 01:16:54.820]   It takes analytics from all of the places you do stuff, your website, from PayPal, from
[01:16:54.820 --> 01:17:01.660]   Amazon, everywhere and puts that data together in a way like business intelligence that you
[01:17:01.660 --> 01:17:04.820]   can then act upon and see what works for you.
[01:17:04.820 --> 01:17:10.740]   See if those retweets stimulated a flow to your Pinterest page, that kind of thing.
[01:17:10.740 --> 01:17:14.540]   They've made deals and they're making more deals all the time with many of the big social
[01:17:14.540 --> 01:17:15.740]   networks.
[01:17:15.740 --> 01:17:18.940]   This is an amazing idea.
[01:17:18.940 --> 01:17:23.940]   It's kind of like, you know, some of the nerds I know love pivot tables, you know, the
[01:17:23.940 --> 01:17:24.940]   idea...
[01:17:24.940 --> 01:17:26.580]   I had such a pivot table moment at work the other day.
[01:17:26.580 --> 01:17:27.580]   You're such a nerd.
[01:17:27.580 --> 01:17:28.580]   Oh my God.
[01:17:28.580 --> 01:17:30.060]   When you get the data in the right place...
[01:17:30.060 --> 01:17:33.100]   This is pivot tables that you don't have to know what the hell you're doing.
[01:17:33.100 --> 01:17:36.940]   This will take the data and remix it, remix it in new ways that gives you insights into
[01:17:36.940 --> 01:17:38.700]   what you're doing.
[01:17:38.700 --> 01:17:42.140]   You can be a data scientist without studying data science.
[01:17:42.140 --> 01:17:47.940]   You can get their some all email every day so that you understand what's going on.
[01:17:47.940 --> 01:17:50.220]   And this is all free to you right now.
[01:17:50.220 --> 01:17:51.900]   I want you to try it out.
[01:17:51.900 --> 01:17:54.060]   S-U-M-A-L-L.com.
[01:17:54.060 --> 01:17:58.220]   If you sell online, if you're just building brand, if you're building attention, when
[01:17:58.220 --> 01:18:02.100]   I start my new vlog, I think I'll be Leo Poops.
[01:18:02.100 --> 01:18:03.100]   Yeah, that one.
[01:18:03.100 --> 01:18:07.420]   I think I'll be using this to track hits.
[01:18:07.420 --> 01:18:11.820]   You connect YouTube up to Instagram up to Twitter up to Facebook up to Bing up to Google
[01:18:11.820 --> 01:18:14.100]   up to Amazon up to PayPal up to eBay.
[01:18:14.100 --> 01:18:16.220]   Suddenly you start getting some insights.
[01:18:16.220 --> 01:18:17.220]   Looks cool.
[01:18:17.220 --> 01:18:18.580]   It's kind of amazing.
[01:18:18.580 --> 01:18:19.580]   So try it free.
[01:18:19.580 --> 01:18:20.580]   Someall.com.
[01:18:20.580 --> 01:18:25.420]   You see, I don't know how to describe this except that if you know what BI is, if you're
[01:18:25.420 --> 01:18:29.060]   used to that notion, it's transformed the way businesses operate.
[01:18:29.060 --> 01:18:33.620]   When I was at revision three, and when we tweet out an episode, a link, and we wouldn't
[01:18:33.620 --> 01:18:35.340]   know if it had any impact or effect.
[01:18:35.340 --> 01:18:36.940]   We're using it now for exactly that reason.
[01:18:36.940 --> 01:18:39.300]   We want to know what social campaigns make, what difference?
[01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:40.300]   Time of day.
[01:18:40.300 --> 01:18:44.460]   And not just to downloads, but to t-shirt sales and to, you know, I mean, all of its
[01:18:44.460 --> 01:18:45.460]   time together.
[01:18:45.460 --> 01:18:46.460]   It's very interesting.
[01:18:46.460 --> 01:18:47.460]   We do it all manually right now.
[01:18:47.460 --> 01:18:51.460]   Curtis has to go in and look at store sales tutorials and look at how all this stuff is
[01:18:51.460 --> 01:18:52.460]   going to be.
[01:18:52.460 --> 01:18:53.460]   Curtis tries.
[01:18:53.460 --> 01:18:54.460]   Where is Curtis?
[01:18:54.460 --> 01:18:55.460]   Someall.com.
[01:18:55.460 --> 01:18:56.460]   Okay?
[01:18:56.460 --> 01:18:57.460]   Yeah.
[01:18:57.460 --> 01:18:58.460]   Have you heard of it?
[01:18:58.460 --> 01:18:59.460]   Well, use it.
[01:18:59.460 --> 01:19:02.900]   I don't want to put you out of business, but I think this could be very useful.
[01:19:02.900 --> 01:19:03.900]   It's free.
[01:19:03.900 --> 01:19:04.900]   All right.
[01:19:04.900 --> 01:19:05.900]   The price is right.
[01:19:05.900 --> 01:19:06.900]   You know what?
[01:19:06.900 --> 01:19:07.900]   Would you report back to me, Trey, someday?
[01:19:07.900 --> 01:19:08.900]   Just let me an email saying what you thought about it.
[01:19:08.900 --> 01:19:12.300]   And Dane Atkinson, if you want to get connected, I know you know the Squarespace guys.
[01:19:12.300 --> 01:19:13.300]   He's just-
[01:19:13.300 --> 01:19:14.300]   Don't know the space.
[01:19:14.300 --> 01:19:15.300]   I don't know those guys.
[01:19:15.300 --> 01:19:16.300]   You should know those guys.
[01:19:16.300 --> 01:19:17.300]   Dane's a good dude.
[01:19:17.300 --> 01:19:18.300]   Well, Dane's not there anymore.
[01:19:18.300 --> 01:19:19.300]   He went and started this.
[01:19:19.300 --> 01:19:21.340]   He took some of his money and said, "I think I want to do something different."
[01:19:21.340 --> 01:19:27.100]   Sales, sites, visits, fans and followers, one secure, convenient place, compared data
[01:19:27.100 --> 01:19:28.500]   across different platforms.
[01:19:28.500 --> 01:19:31.340]   Deep insights, probably the word I should use.
[01:19:31.340 --> 01:19:32.340]   Oh, yeah.
[01:19:32.340 --> 01:19:33.340]   Deep insight.
[01:19:33.340 --> 01:19:38.020]   Google Analytics, authorized net, Google AdWords, Shopify, Bing, Facebook, Twitter, YouTube,
[01:19:38.020 --> 01:19:39.020]   Amazon.
[01:19:39.020 --> 01:19:40.020]   It's kind of amazing.
[01:19:40.020 --> 01:19:43.140]   And they're adding- they're making deals with services all the time.
[01:19:43.140 --> 01:19:44.900]   That list gets longer all the time.
[01:19:44.900 --> 01:19:45.900]   Someall.com.
[01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:46.900]   It's free.
[01:19:46.900 --> 01:19:47.900]   I asked him, "What's your business model?"
[01:19:47.900 --> 01:19:49.420]   He says, "I don't know yet."
[01:19:49.420 --> 01:19:50.420]   Seriously.
[01:19:50.420 --> 01:19:51.420]   Yeah.
[01:19:51.420 --> 01:19:55.020]   He says, "Well, maybe it'll be free, but maybe not."
[01:19:55.020 --> 01:19:56.180]   I think that's a smart way to do it.
[01:19:56.180 --> 01:19:57.180]   Just build something awesome.
[01:19:57.180 --> 01:19:58.180]   Makes something.
[01:19:58.180 --> 01:19:59.180]   And then figure it out later.
[01:19:59.180 --> 01:20:00.180]   That's his attitude.
[01:20:00.180 --> 01:20:01.180]   He says, "I just want to make something awesome."
[01:20:01.180 --> 01:20:02.180]   And you know the truth is he doesn't need the money.
[01:20:02.180 --> 01:20:03.180]   He just went- he just needed it.
[01:20:03.180 --> 01:20:04.180]   That must be nice.
[01:20:04.180 --> 01:20:05.180]   I know.
[01:20:05.180 --> 01:20:06.180]   I wish I had that money.
[01:20:06.180 --> 01:20:08.660]   He just- he's going to build something awesome and then see what happens.
[01:20:08.660 --> 01:20:10.100]   That's our model for Stuck on Earth.
[01:20:10.100 --> 01:20:11.260]   We have no business model.
[01:20:11.260 --> 01:20:12.260]   Just build it.
[01:20:12.260 --> 01:20:13.260]   It's a beautiful app.
[01:20:13.260 --> 01:20:14.260]   It's awesome.
[01:20:14.260 --> 01:20:15.260]   I don't know what's going to happen.
[01:20:15.260 --> 01:20:16.860]   You're the most zen guy ever.
[01:20:16.860 --> 01:20:17.860]   Stuck on Earth.
[01:20:17.860 --> 01:20:18.860]   It's on iPad.
[01:20:18.860 --> 01:20:19.860]   Is there an iPhone version or just iPad?
[01:20:19.860 --> 01:20:20.860]   No.
[01:20:20.860 --> 01:20:21.860]   Just iPad.
[01:20:21.860 --> 01:20:22.860]   And we just released for Android.
[01:20:22.860 --> 01:20:23.860]   Totally free.
[01:20:23.860 --> 01:20:24.860]   No ads.
[01:20:24.860 --> 01:20:25.860]   You have it.
[01:20:25.860 --> 01:20:26.860]   No, I don't have it but I'm going to download it.
[01:20:26.860 --> 01:20:27.860]   Oh man.
[01:20:27.860 --> 01:20:28.860]   There's a Leo Esterig on that.
[01:20:28.860 --> 01:20:29.860]   Oh, is there?
[01:20:29.860 --> 01:20:30.860]   I'm going to do it right now.
[01:20:30.860 --> 01:20:32.420]   Actually, there's a Ron Esterig too, right?
[01:20:32.420 --> 01:20:33.420]   Everybody has an Esterig.
[01:20:33.420 --> 01:20:34.420]   Yeah, there's a lot of names on that.
[01:20:34.420 --> 01:20:35.420]   You will love it, bro.
[01:20:35.420 --> 01:20:37.860]   That is good.
[01:20:37.860 --> 01:20:40.380]   Trey also has- God, you have 100 cameras in one.
[01:20:40.380 --> 01:20:41.380]   What else do you have?
[01:20:41.380 --> 01:20:42.380]   You got a million-
[01:20:42.380 --> 01:20:43.380]   All kinds of stuff.
[01:20:43.380 --> 01:20:44.380]   He's got a lot of-
[01:20:44.380 --> 01:20:45.380]   He's just a lot of-
[01:20:45.380 --> 01:20:47.620]   We just opened a new store on the website too where we sell video tutorials.
[01:20:47.620 --> 01:20:48.900]   Stuck in customs.com.
[01:20:48.900 --> 01:20:49.900]   Yeah.
[01:20:49.900 --> 01:20:50.900]   Lightroom presets.
[01:20:50.900 --> 01:20:52.220]   I use your lightroom presets.
[01:20:52.220 --> 01:20:53.460]   They're really awesome.
[01:20:53.460 --> 01:20:54.700]   Those aren't free.
[01:20:54.700 --> 01:20:55.700]   Those aren't free.
[01:20:55.700 --> 01:20:56.700]   But we've got a ton of stuff.
[01:20:56.700 --> 01:20:58.460]   Did you give a name or did I pay for them?
[01:20:58.460 --> 01:20:59.460]   I don't even remember.
[01:20:59.460 --> 01:21:00.460]   You must have given them.
[01:21:00.460 --> 01:21:01.460]   I don't remember either.
[01:21:01.460 --> 01:21:02.460]   They're awesome.
[01:21:02.460 --> 01:21:03.460]   Thank you.
[01:21:03.460 --> 01:21:04.460]   No, they sell one day.
[01:21:04.460 --> 01:21:06.460]   I think over a three-day period, we sold like 1,800 of them.
[01:21:06.460 --> 01:21:07.460]   Well, it's crazy.
[01:21:07.460 --> 01:21:08.460]   Lightroom, man.
[01:21:08.460 --> 01:21:11.820]   This is one of the best things about lightroom is you can, with a preset, do a lot.
[01:21:11.820 --> 01:21:12.820]   Yeah.
[01:21:12.820 --> 01:21:16.780]   If you want your pictures to look like trays, I got a button that says, "Trayify it."
[01:21:16.780 --> 01:21:17.780]   Yeah.
[01:21:17.780 --> 01:21:18.780]   And it just does it.
[01:21:18.780 --> 01:21:20.340]   How can you do that?
[01:21:20.340 --> 01:21:22.820]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:21:22.820 --> 01:21:23.820]   You need this, all right.
[01:21:23.820 --> 01:21:24.820]   I'll send you some.
[01:21:24.820 --> 01:21:25.820]   I know.
[01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:26.820]   I'm like, "Freeze it."
[01:21:26.820 --> 01:21:27.820]   You will love these presets.
[01:21:27.820 --> 01:21:28.820]   Oh, they're so good.
[01:21:28.820 --> 01:21:29.820]   Do you use Lightroom, Mom?
[01:21:29.820 --> 01:21:31.380]   Well, I'll buy it now.
[01:21:31.380 --> 01:21:32.380]   Oh, it's worth it.
[01:21:32.380 --> 01:21:33.380]   It's in the app store.
[01:21:33.380 --> 01:21:34.380]   It's easy.
[01:21:34.380 --> 01:21:35.740]   Lightroom 5, what do you think?
[01:21:35.740 --> 01:21:37.540]   Have you played with it at all?
[01:21:37.540 --> 01:21:40.380]   I'm not as thrilled by it as some people are.
[01:21:40.380 --> 01:21:45.660]   I mean, there's a lot of adobe shills out there that just praise everything adobe does.
[01:21:45.660 --> 01:21:47.180]   I'm very cynical.
[01:21:47.180 --> 01:21:50.620]   I feel like Om, actually, I'm a super optimistic Zen guy.
[01:21:50.620 --> 01:21:53.100]   I see Om is sort of like this cynical curmudgeon.
[01:21:53.100 --> 01:21:55.860]   But that's what I feel like with adobe.
[01:21:55.860 --> 01:21:58.540]   What about this move that you can't buy the software anymore?
[01:21:58.540 --> 01:22:00.340]   I can't believe you just diss me like that.
[01:22:00.340 --> 01:22:01.340]   No, no, no, that's good.
[01:22:01.340 --> 01:22:02.340]   No, it's good.
[01:22:02.340 --> 01:22:03.340]   It means you have taters.
[01:22:03.340 --> 01:22:06.380]   You talk to him like he wasn't sitting next to you.
[01:22:06.380 --> 01:22:08.540]   Oh, wait, he's a guest on this show.
[01:22:08.540 --> 01:22:10.060]   No, Om, you're great.
[01:22:10.060 --> 01:22:11.460]   Because actually, you know, you're cynical.
[01:22:11.460 --> 01:22:12.780]   You got to be cynical in this industry.
[01:22:12.780 --> 01:22:13.780]   So that's kind of your thing.
[01:22:13.780 --> 01:22:14.780]   That's cynical optimist.
[01:22:14.780 --> 01:22:15.780]   That's how I like to describe.
[01:22:15.780 --> 01:22:16.780]   That's perfect.
[01:22:16.780 --> 01:22:18.780]   We love technology and we recognize the issues.
[01:22:18.780 --> 01:22:19.780]   This is what I was getting back to.
[01:22:19.780 --> 01:22:21.780]   But it's our job to keep modest.
[01:22:21.780 --> 01:22:26.780]   Because, you know, so how about this adobe move to the creative cloud?
[01:22:26.780 --> 01:22:27.780]   Everything's subscription now.
[01:22:27.780 --> 01:22:29.780]   I think it's not a good move.
[01:22:29.780 --> 01:22:30.780]   It's angering so many times.
[01:22:30.780 --> 01:22:31.780]   It really is.
[01:22:31.780 --> 01:22:37.780]   Because I think they don't understand is that adobe has, for Photoshop, there's two
[01:22:37.780 --> 01:22:38.780]   distinct crowds.
[01:22:38.780 --> 01:22:41.780]   There's like the pros and the studios and people like me.
[01:22:41.780 --> 01:22:42.780]   I don't mind paying $30.
[01:22:42.780 --> 01:22:43.780]   And there's people like me.
[01:22:43.780 --> 01:22:44.780]   There's people like me.
[01:22:44.780 --> 01:22:45.780]   But there's a lot of hobbyists and stuff.
[01:22:45.780 --> 01:22:49.780]   There's a lot of hobbyists and students and people that just can't afford what is that?
[01:22:49.780 --> 01:22:50.780]   $360.
[01:22:50.780 --> 01:22:51.780]   It's a big investment for me.
[01:22:51.780 --> 01:22:52.780]   I don't want to spend that money around.
[01:22:52.780 --> 01:22:54.780]   Yeah, I think it's not a good move.
[01:22:54.780 --> 01:22:58.780]   And then they have a totally different business model with adobe lightroom.
[01:22:58.780 --> 01:23:02.780]   You know, which is also a good one for hobbyists and pros.
[01:23:02.780 --> 01:23:03.780]   But you need Photoshop.
[01:23:03.780 --> 01:23:05.780]   You use Photoshop and Lightroom.
[01:23:05.780 --> 01:23:06.780]   I use both.
[01:23:06.780 --> 01:23:07.780]   It's part of your workflow.
[01:23:07.780 --> 01:23:08.780]   You get both.
[01:23:08.780 --> 01:23:11.780]   And you have to engage with adobe with two different business models.
[01:23:11.780 --> 01:23:12.780]   Yeah, that's crazy.
[01:23:12.780 --> 01:23:15.780]   So I think they're in trouble.
[01:23:15.780 --> 01:23:20.340]   And also, speaking of adobe, I think they're in trouble with this move from Google and the
[01:23:20.340 --> 01:23:22.780]   way that they're going to start organizing your photos for you.
[01:23:22.780 --> 01:23:24.780]   Let's talk about that.
[01:23:24.780 --> 01:23:25.780]   Hi.
[01:23:25.780 --> 01:23:27.780]   You know, that's another one where I went.
[01:23:27.780 --> 01:23:28.780]   So there's so many technology.
[01:23:28.780 --> 01:23:32.780]   You see so many technology things that are solution in search of a problem.
[01:23:32.780 --> 01:23:34.460]   But everybody has this problem.
[01:23:34.460 --> 01:23:38.140]   You take too many pictures and you don't know and you never get around of sorting them.
[01:23:38.140 --> 01:23:39.780]   And now you just got a blob.
[01:23:39.780 --> 01:23:40.780]   Yeah.
[01:23:40.780 --> 01:23:42.740]   And it looked like it did a pretty critical thing.
[01:23:42.740 --> 01:23:43.740]   It did a pretty valuable job.
[01:23:43.740 --> 01:23:45.740]   It does a really nice job.
[01:23:45.740 --> 01:23:48.300]   And so we should explain what it does.
[01:23:48.300 --> 01:23:53.180]   If you use Google+, you have on or an Android phone, you have automatic uploads of all your
[01:23:53.180 --> 01:23:55.660]   images to your Google+ privately.
[01:23:55.660 --> 01:23:56.660]   Right.
[01:23:56.660 --> 01:24:00.100]   And now the new thing is, I guess Google's kind of phasing out Picasa Web a little bit.
[01:24:00.100 --> 01:24:01.100]   Yeah, they got it.
[01:24:01.100 --> 01:24:06.340]   Moving that stuff into Google+ in terms of sharing, but also in terms of tools, they're
[01:24:06.340 --> 01:24:07.660]   all on the web.
[01:24:07.660 --> 01:24:11.380]   And one of the things it does, you have to check the box and say, do this, is it will
[01:24:11.380 --> 01:24:13.580]   go through all your photos and pick the best ones.
[01:24:13.580 --> 01:24:14.580]   Yeah.
[01:24:14.580 --> 01:24:15.580]   And it did it with mine.
[01:24:15.580 --> 01:24:18.260]   And it was, I looked at it and said, oh yeah, those are the best.
[01:24:18.260 --> 01:24:19.260]   Okay.
[01:24:19.260 --> 01:24:20.700]   It's got a smart algorithm.
[01:24:20.700 --> 01:24:21.700]   It takes out all year.
[01:24:21.700 --> 01:24:23.100]   It doesn't delete your blurry photos.
[01:24:23.100 --> 01:24:24.260]   No, they're all still there.
[01:24:24.260 --> 01:24:25.660]   Or duplicates.
[01:24:25.660 --> 01:24:28.540]   It looks at people in your circles who you have affinity towards.
[01:24:28.540 --> 01:24:33.020]   If they're smiling, like your family are smiling, it's going to promote those up to the front.
[01:24:33.020 --> 01:24:35.220]   It looks at basic human aesthetics.
[01:24:35.220 --> 01:24:38.940]   What kind of things do people like to see in landscaping photos?
[01:24:38.940 --> 01:24:40.260]   Those move to the front.
[01:24:40.260 --> 01:24:41.820]   But this is a huge problem.
[01:24:41.820 --> 01:24:44.660]   People take so many photos and they never get a chance to organize them.
[01:24:44.660 --> 01:24:50.500]   And hitherto, their only solution, which I recommend even to casual and hobbyist photographers,
[01:24:50.500 --> 01:24:52.180]   is you got to get Adobe Lightroom.
[01:24:52.180 --> 01:24:53.180]   Right.
[01:24:53.180 --> 01:24:58.740]   But now, and that's Adobe's biggest growth area too, is hobbyist and advanced amateurs
[01:24:58.740 --> 01:24:59.740]   who want to buy their products.
[01:24:59.740 --> 01:25:01.780]   Pretty much every pro already has Lightroom.
[01:25:01.780 --> 01:25:03.700]   There's no growth there for Adobe.
[01:25:03.700 --> 01:25:08.620]   But it's all these people that have entry level DSLRs or compact cameras or cell phones.
[01:25:08.620 --> 01:25:12.180]   And their photos are just an organizational mess.
[01:25:12.180 --> 01:25:14.540]   But I say, let the cloud do it for you.
[01:25:14.540 --> 01:25:16.300]   Even me as a pro.
[01:25:16.300 --> 01:25:17.540]   So look how it did this.
[01:25:17.540 --> 01:25:22.420]   So these are things in my photo stream that are just automatically uploaded.
[01:25:22.420 --> 01:25:24.260]   It's made bigger the better pictures.
[01:25:24.260 --> 01:25:25.500]   It knows I like bacon.
[01:25:25.500 --> 01:25:27.100]   That's a good shot of bacon.
[01:25:27.100 --> 01:25:28.700]   That's a hell of a shot.
[01:25:28.700 --> 01:25:29.700]   Somehow.
[01:25:29.700 --> 01:25:32.300]   Google Plus made the bacon bigger.
[01:25:32.300 --> 01:25:34.780]   And it made some of the bad pictures smaller.
[01:25:34.780 --> 01:25:36.980]   And then it has another button.
[01:25:36.980 --> 01:25:41.100]   I'm not going to scroll down too far because I don't know what else other stuff's down here.
[01:25:41.100 --> 01:25:43.380]   But it then has a button that says, see the rest.
[01:25:43.380 --> 01:25:44.380]   Right.
[01:25:44.380 --> 01:25:45.380]   They're all there.
[01:25:45.380 --> 01:25:46.380]   Now, do you think it does a good job with this?
[01:25:46.380 --> 01:25:47.380]   Have you tried it on your photos?
[01:25:47.380 --> 01:25:49.020]   It does a very good job.
[01:25:49.020 --> 01:25:50.020]   Yeah.
[01:25:50.020 --> 01:25:51.020]   It's very smart.
[01:25:51.020 --> 01:25:52.020]   Do it.
[01:25:52.020 --> 01:25:53.020]   No.
[01:25:53.020 --> 01:25:54.020]   Let's just kind of nice algorithm.
[01:25:54.020 --> 01:25:55.020]   And I think it will get better over time.
[01:25:55.020 --> 01:25:56.700]   It's almost like having an assistant make a first pass.
[01:25:56.700 --> 01:25:57.700]   Yes.
[01:25:57.700 --> 01:25:59.340]   And if it makes a mistake, you can just go correct it.
[01:25:59.340 --> 01:26:01.580]   It will learn over time.
[01:26:01.580 --> 01:26:02.580]   Let it do it for you.
[01:26:02.580 --> 01:26:05.300]   It's incredibly clever and it's just going to get smarter.
[01:26:05.300 --> 01:26:06.300]   And it's free.
[01:26:06.300 --> 01:26:08.300]   So they named it Auto Awesome.
[01:26:08.300 --> 01:26:09.300]   Yes.
[01:26:09.300 --> 01:26:10.300]   Auto Awesome is another effect.
[01:26:10.300 --> 01:26:11.980]   That's your press button.
[01:26:11.980 --> 01:26:12.980]   Right.
[01:26:12.980 --> 01:26:14.180]   And it enhances, right?
[01:26:14.180 --> 01:26:15.180]   No.
[01:26:15.180 --> 01:26:16.180]   Awesomeizes your photos.
[01:26:16.180 --> 01:26:17.180]   Yes.
[01:26:17.180 --> 01:26:19.940]   Like if you take a bunch of photos in a row, it'll make animated GIFs for you.
[01:26:19.940 --> 01:26:21.020]   That's kind of cool too.
[01:26:21.020 --> 01:26:26.700]   So I like this feature on the HTC One called the Zoe where it takes a video but then takes
[01:26:26.700 --> 01:26:29.260]   20 shots out of that three second video.
[01:26:29.260 --> 01:26:30.260]   And you get animated.
[01:26:30.260 --> 01:26:32.260]   You have nice animated pictures which you can later use.
[01:26:32.260 --> 01:26:33.980]   So this is an effect kind of a reverse Zoe.
[01:26:33.980 --> 01:26:34.980]   It's making GIFs.
[01:26:34.980 --> 01:26:39.100]   If I take 20 or five pictures really quickly, it'll make an animated GIF out.
[01:26:39.100 --> 01:26:40.620]   It's sort of a fun thing.
[01:26:40.620 --> 01:26:41.620]   It's great.
[01:26:41.620 --> 01:26:42.700]   I wish it had done that with a bacon.
[01:26:42.700 --> 01:26:45.100]   But I mean this is--
[01:26:45.100 --> 01:26:50.100]   So is it good enough for-- I mean you're a professional photographer.
[01:26:50.100 --> 01:26:52.500]   So you make your money.
[01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:55.060]   Is this good enough for you to walk away from Lightroom?
[01:26:55.060 --> 01:26:57.340]   I mean you praise it pretty highly.
[01:26:57.340 --> 01:26:58.540]   Would you use this?
[01:26:58.540 --> 01:26:59.540]   No.
[01:26:59.540 --> 01:27:01.220]   So I'm a pro.
[01:27:01.220 --> 01:27:04.180]   And I have the same problem as everybody.
[01:27:04.180 --> 01:27:09.060]   So my professional photos, my epic landscape shots or whatever, I will always, at least
[01:27:09.060 --> 01:27:13.500]   for the foreseeable future, use Lightroom and Photomattics and Photoshop on my client
[01:27:13.500 --> 01:27:14.500]   system to do those.
[01:27:14.500 --> 01:27:15.500]   Always.
[01:27:15.500 --> 01:27:19.140]   Well I mean at least for the next few years until the cloud gets super fast.
[01:27:19.140 --> 01:27:24.220]   Or if we get a Chrome app, let's say Nick makes a successor to Photoshop and it's all
[01:27:24.220 --> 01:27:27.620]   on the client side in a Chrome app, I could do a lot in there.
[01:27:27.620 --> 01:27:32.340]   But other than that, I'm just a regular guy that takes a ton of family photos, a ton of
[01:27:32.340 --> 01:27:34.780]   snapshots as I'm walking on the streets.
[01:27:34.780 --> 01:27:38.580]   I don't have time to put that through my same Lightroom workflow.
[01:27:38.580 --> 01:27:43.500]   So for all my regular life shots of which there's a ton, just like everybody else, I'll
[01:27:43.500 --> 01:27:45.420]   let Google handle that.
[01:27:45.420 --> 01:27:49.860]   I'll just upload it to the cloud and that'll save me hours and hours and hours of time
[01:27:49.860 --> 01:27:52.620]   that I can now focus on my pro shots.
[01:27:52.620 --> 01:27:58.340]   So this is an example, I have, these are five or six shots taken of this group and it picked
[01:27:58.340 --> 01:28:01.060]   the ones with the best smiles.
[01:28:01.060 --> 01:28:02.700]   That's awesome, everybody's smiling at it.
[01:28:02.700 --> 01:28:03.980]   They're all happy.
[01:28:03.980 --> 01:28:06.260]   I wish I'd picked the ones with the best hats.
[01:28:06.260 --> 01:28:12.140]   But I just think that kind of smarts, if it's better than your average artificial intelligence,
[01:28:12.140 --> 01:28:13.140]   it's pretty good.
[01:28:13.140 --> 01:28:14.140]   Yeah.
[01:28:14.140 --> 01:28:15.860]   And it is a problem everybody has.
[01:28:15.860 --> 01:28:20.060]   I'm looking at some of your, you because you're a pro, you do a lot of burst mode photography.
[01:28:20.060 --> 01:28:24.060]   So a number of your photos are automatically automated, GIFs.
[01:28:24.060 --> 01:28:25.340]   I don't do enough burst mode, I guess.
[01:28:25.340 --> 01:28:26.340]   I'll do some more.
[01:28:26.340 --> 01:28:27.340]   Yeah, it's fine.
[01:28:27.340 --> 01:28:28.340]   All right.
[01:28:28.340 --> 01:28:30.140]   What about the new Google+, let's talk about that.
[01:28:30.140 --> 01:28:32.260]   Some people thought very controversial.
[01:28:32.260 --> 01:28:34.940]   It's two or three columns, depending on how wide your screen is.
[01:28:34.940 --> 01:28:38.260]   I should point out, if you go to the more in the menu at the very bottom, they kind of
[01:28:38.260 --> 01:28:39.300]   hide it.
[01:28:39.300 --> 01:28:42.300]   There is a revert to single column.
[01:28:42.300 --> 01:28:43.620]   So you're not stuck with this.
[01:28:43.620 --> 01:28:46.100]   You can choose between the two different modes.
[01:28:46.100 --> 01:28:49.220]   But when you've got a widescreen monitor, like most of us do now, that single column
[01:28:49.220 --> 01:28:51.540]   looks awful empty when you do it.
[01:28:51.540 --> 01:28:55.620]   I actually, I was complaining about the Google+ layout when they went to the new layout,
[01:28:55.620 --> 01:28:59.180]   not the previous new layout because of all this wasted space.
[01:28:59.180 --> 01:29:02.100]   And so for me, this is a very Pinterest-y look.
[01:29:02.100 --> 01:29:03.900]   Isn't that where the influence is?
[01:29:03.900 --> 01:29:04.900]   That tiles are.
[01:29:04.900 --> 01:29:05.900]   That tiles are.
[01:29:05.900 --> 01:29:06.900]   That tile is.
[01:29:06.900 --> 01:29:08.740]   Mr. Pinterest, the one guy I know who uses Pinterest.
[01:29:08.740 --> 01:29:11.620]   It's also like a new Facebook timeline.
[01:29:11.620 --> 01:29:13.100]   It is very much like Facebook.
[01:29:13.100 --> 01:29:14.100]   Yeah.
[01:29:14.100 --> 01:29:15.100]   Right.
[01:29:15.100 --> 01:29:16.100]   And I think that's really there.
[01:29:16.100 --> 01:29:18.740]   It is really is a magazine layout.
[01:29:18.740 --> 01:29:20.100]   It's not Pinterest-ed in a vanna.
[01:29:20.100 --> 01:29:21.260]   This is a magazine layout.
[01:29:21.260 --> 01:29:22.740]   Is it like Flipboard?
[01:29:22.740 --> 01:29:24.700]   Yeah, I think this is very different.
[01:29:24.700 --> 01:29:27.460]   I think the companies take in a different direction.
[01:29:27.460 --> 01:29:29.220]   This is not like Facebook.
[01:29:29.220 --> 01:29:35.900]   I think Facebook is still very centered around people and what people do on their service.
[01:29:35.900 --> 01:29:42.060]   And this one is Google doing what Google does best as machines crunching data and showing
[01:29:42.060 --> 01:29:49.580]   information based on how people have shared and how the interactions are between people
[01:29:49.580 --> 01:29:50.580]   and the data.
[01:29:50.580 --> 01:29:52.300]   It's a data-driven design.
[01:29:52.300 --> 01:29:57.140]   And it's pretty interesting because I think in the future, many of the apps are going
[01:29:57.140 --> 01:30:00.460]   to be built using this kind of ideology.
[01:30:00.460 --> 01:30:06.100]   And the reason they are able to do it because they have the resources to process massive
[01:30:06.100 --> 01:30:13.260]   amounts of data to define a design which is based on these data correlations.
[01:30:13.260 --> 01:30:17.820]   I think this is going to be a very interesting first move from Google.
[01:30:17.820 --> 01:30:23.580]   I really do feel that this is a positive direction from them on a design perspective
[01:30:23.580 --> 01:30:24.860]   for Google+.
[01:30:24.860 --> 01:30:30.100]   The biggest challenge they have is how to get more people to use it, which will always
[01:30:30.100 --> 01:30:31.100]   remain a problem.
[01:30:31.100 --> 01:30:38.820]   I see no reason why I need to use Google+ as a central location.
[01:30:38.820 --> 01:30:45.500]   I'm happy to use Google+ applications, like the awesome and the highlights and all those
[01:30:45.500 --> 01:30:47.740]   things are kind of nice and cool.
[01:30:47.740 --> 01:30:52.340]   And if they were standalone apps, they would actually be more useful than this idea of
[01:30:52.340 --> 01:30:57.580]   this one unified place where we all go to and see what is happening.
[01:30:57.580 --> 01:31:03.420]   So I actually wrote about this and I definitely feel that they have taken a different direction.
[01:31:03.420 --> 01:31:08.140]   I think Gondotra said this, the week Gondotra said this, and he said that we put Google
[01:31:08.140 --> 01:31:09.620]   and Google+.
[01:31:09.620 --> 01:31:14.300]   What essentially that means is they put the power of the machine in Google+.
[01:31:14.300 --> 01:31:15.300]   Exactly.
[01:31:15.300 --> 01:31:18.980]   Well, things like automatically figuring out hashtags when you make a post.
[01:31:18.980 --> 01:31:19.980]   That's amazing.
[01:31:19.980 --> 01:31:22.860]   And just like that's exactly what it is.
[01:31:22.860 --> 01:31:27.500]   And I think they need to kind of just forget about the stream and just go make it easier
[01:31:27.500 --> 01:31:34.900]   for people to do what they do, which is like use photo applications and find information
[01:31:34.900 --> 01:31:39.820]   on Google and become more natural.
[01:31:39.820 --> 01:31:45.780]   You know, you say behavior on Google is finding information, consuming information.
[01:31:45.780 --> 01:31:47.500]   That's what they should be doing.
[01:31:47.500 --> 01:31:50.300]   Social is not a natural behavior on Google.
[01:31:50.300 --> 01:31:52.300]   And I think that's exactly what they're realizing.
[01:31:52.300 --> 01:31:53.300]   Interesting.
[01:31:53.300 --> 01:31:54.300]   That's interesting.
[01:31:54.300 --> 01:31:57.300]   Yeah, that's kind of the, you articulated much better than I did, but that's the sense,
[01:31:57.300 --> 01:31:58.300]   the feeling I got it.
[01:31:58.300 --> 01:32:00.740]   I didn't feel like this is a community particularly.
[01:32:00.740 --> 01:32:03.620]   But I have to say, I love it in the new Google+ especially.
[01:32:03.620 --> 01:32:05.420]   Love scanning it.
[01:32:05.420 --> 01:32:07.460]   There's always something interesting in it now.
[01:32:07.460 --> 01:32:11.180]   And it's not because I put together such great circles because most of the people I know
[01:32:11.180 --> 01:32:12.900]   are not on Google+.
[01:32:12.900 --> 01:32:14.780]   Well, the three columns is nice.
[01:32:14.780 --> 01:32:19.060]   You know, I do think we can read more data than we could last year and we could read more
[01:32:19.060 --> 01:32:20.060]   data a few years ago.
[01:32:20.060 --> 01:32:23.020]   So here's a post that mentions Ronald Reagan.
[01:32:23.020 --> 01:32:26.060]   So automatically it's hashtag with Ronald Reagan.
[01:32:26.060 --> 01:32:31.420]   And then I'm going to get other related searches and I can scroll through Ronald Reagan posts
[01:32:31.420 --> 01:32:33.060]   related hashtags.
[01:32:33.060 --> 01:32:37.540]   This really makes you want to browse, which is what Pinterest does so well.
[01:32:37.540 --> 01:32:38.540]   Right.
[01:32:38.540 --> 01:32:42.980]   I think the big difference is that the interaction to me, at least the user interaction is so
[01:32:42.980 --> 01:32:47.180]   much more improved and right now, both on the mobile app side and the desktop on the
[01:32:47.180 --> 01:32:51.260]   website, so much better than Facebook and comparing social networks to social networks.
[01:32:51.260 --> 01:32:54.300]   We're talking a lot about Facebook's woes on, at least on the Android side with their
[01:32:54.300 --> 01:32:58.380]   application and how Facebook home is a step in the right direction and things like that.
[01:32:58.380 --> 01:33:00.180]   But I mean, oh, I'm absolutely right.
[01:33:00.180 --> 01:33:03.940]   It's the power of a platform like this is as good as who uses it.
[01:33:03.940 --> 01:33:07.940]   But I have to say, because of the better design, I notice I'm commenting more, plus
[01:33:07.940 --> 01:33:09.700]   wanting more, I am engaging more.
[01:33:09.700 --> 01:33:11.900]   So a good design can drive more engagement.
[01:33:11.900 --> 01:33:12.900]   Right.
[01:33:12.900 --> 01:33:15.860]   But you're not necessarily engaging with the people you want to be engaging with their
[01:33:15.860 --> 01:33:16.860]   owners.
[01:33:16.860 --> 01:33:18.340]   They're just across the street or something like that.
[01:33:18.340 --> 01:33:23.300]   So I wonder if the problem with Google+, if they can get over it, is the timing.
[01:33:23.300 --> 01:33:27.260]   Is that Facebook being so early to the game and getting so many users?
[01:33:27.260 --> 01:33:30.820]   I know the vast majority of my personal network is all on Facebook.
[01:33:30.820 --> 01:33:35.100]   And despite my praising Android and praising Google and trying to get them to come over,
[01:33:35.100 --> 01:33:36.100]   they're not going to come over.
[01:33:36.100 --> 01:33:37.100]   Right.
[01:33:37.100 --> 01:33:38.100]   Yeah.
[01:33:38.100 --> 01:33:40.500]   Trey, you get most of your interaction on Facebook, I would imagine, as opposed to Google+, or
[01:33:40.500 --> 01:33:41.500]   maybe not.
[01:33:41.500 --> 01:33:44.460]   No, no, I definitely get more on Google+, oh, interesting.
[01:33:44.460 --> 01:33:48.340]   Facebook is definitely a close second, though.
[01:33:48.340 --> 01:33:50.260]   The number of followers is different in both.
[01:33:50.260 --> 01:33:56.620]   But the number of photo views I get on Google+, is off the charts.
[01:33:56.620 --> 01:34:00.140]   Now with the new redesign, they just hid photo views.
[01:34:00.140 --> 01:34:05.740]   But if I have X million followers, it doesn't mean I get exactly that many photo views,
[01:34:05.740 --> 01:34:09.180]   but I get a lot more than I do comments and plus ones.
[01:34:09.180 --> 01:34:10.180]   Right.
[01:34:10.180 --> 01:34:14.660]   And then there's thousands of photo views, whereas, you know, maybe just a few hundred
[01:34:14.660 --> 01:34:15.660]   plus ones.
[01:34:15.660 --> 01:34:16.660]   All right.
[01:34:16.660 --> 01:34:19.140]   Let's talk about Larry Page.
[01:34:19.140 --> 01:34:25.060]   First of all, we hadn't seen Larry in ages because he's had vocal corporalist, something
[01:34:25.060 --> 01:34:27.340]   that happened to him first when he was a kid.
[01:34:27.340 --> 01:34:30.660]   After cold happened to him again, I guess a couple of years ago, wasn't able to talk.
[01:34:30.660 --> 01:34:34.820]   Took the stage, voice was weak, but it was a Steve Jobs moment when he walks out on the
[01:34:34.820 --> 01:34:35.820]   stage.
[01:34:35.820 --> 01:34:39.140]   And he's kind of sounding weak, even though these are not life-threatening illnesses
[01:34:39.140 --> 01:34:41.980]   for him, it does kind of resonate a little bit.
[01:34:41.980 --> 01:34:45.540]   You've got the CEO up on the stage and he's sounding kind of weak.
[01:34:45.540 --> 01:34:53.500]   But he's also articulating a vision, which was very much a Jobzian vision, a global vision.
[01:34:53.500 --> 01:34:58.580]   Now, I have to say my cynic meter kicked in kind of big time when he said, "Well, we
[01:34:58.580 --> 01:35:02.660]   just want no more negativity and can't we all just get along and we just want to make
[01:35:02.660 --> 01:35:03.660]   new products."
[01:35:03.660 --> 01:35:06.020]   He said, "It's not a zero-sum game."
[01:35:06.020 --> 01:35:08.300]   I agree with the vision he articulated.
[01:35:08.300 --> 01:35:12.020]   I question whether Google lives up to that vision.
[01:35:12.020 --> 01:35:16.940]   Well, this concept of not not a zero-sum game, this is...
[01:35:16.940 --> 01:35:17.940]   I love that.
[01:35:17.940 --> 01:35:18.940]   This is right on.
[01:35:18.940 --> 01:35:19.940]   That's right on.
[01:35:19.940 --> 01:35:20.940]   I do believe they believe that.
[01:35:20.940 --> 01:35:27.420]   And if there's not a finite amount of stuff out there or a wealth or of any of this stuff,
[01:35:27.420 --> 01:35:30.540]   if that's their vision and they're not trying to...
[01:35:30.540 --> 01:35:34.380]   Well, I have to agree with what John Gruber wrote on Daring Fireball, which is, "Yeah,
[01:35:34.380 --> 01:35:38.660]   oh, you just want to create new stuff except that Android's a copy of iPhone and Google
[01:35:38.660 --> 01:35:40.540]   Plus is a copy of Facebook."
[01:35:40.540 --> 01:35:42.580]   I mean, you can go down the list.
[01:35:42.580 --> 01:35:44.860]   Gmail was just another webmail app.
[01:35:44.860 --> 01:35:50.660]   Admittedly, they did it better, but it's not like they're making up new stuff at a whole
[01:35:50.660 --> 01:35:51.660]   cloth.
[01:35:51.660 --> 01:35:53.940]   Well, he's got something on his face that argues that.
[01:35:53.940 --> 01:35:56.100]   Well, yeah, but they didn't mention glass at the keynote.
[01:35:56.100 --> 01:35:57.100]   True.
[01:35:57.100 --> 01:35:58.100]   No, but I don't have to.
[01:35:58.100 --> 01:35:59.980]   In fact, Larry said something I thought was kind of interesting.
[01:35:59.980 --> 01:36:02.460]   Somebody asked him, "So how many of these are you going to make?"
[01:36:02.460 --> 01:36:03.460]   And he said, "I don't know.
[01:36:03.460 --> 01:36:07.660]   Sergey, Sergey's bits, my atoms, I'm bits."
[01:36:07.660 --> 01:36:11.020]   It was like he said, "In fact, there was very little hardware.
[01:36:11.020 --> 01:36:13.420]   In fact, zero hardware talked about."
[01:36:13.420 --> 01:36:16.380]   They mentioned the fact that they're going to do a galaxy as for pure phone and that's
[01:36:16.380 --> 01:36:17.380]   it.
[01:36:17.380 --> 01:36:18.380]   Which is huge.
[01:36:18.380 --> 01:36:19.380]   Huge.
[01:36:19.380 --> 01:36:21.140]   Well, if you got 6 or 5 bucks lying around, it's huge.
[01:36:21.140 --> 01:36:28.660]   I just spent a lot more for this one with the 18 or, no, Samsung crap all over, but I
[01:36:28.660 --> 01:36:31.300]   just feel like we can't let him...
[01:36:31.300 --> 01:36:32.700]   We can't give him a free pass.
[01:36:32.700 --> 01:36:40.140]   He articulated a great vision, but it was a vision of a Google that's an idealized vision.
[01:36:40.140 --> 01:36:41.140]   Yes?
[01:36:41.140 --> 01:36:45.220]   Well, I think he's blue sky and he's very Zen.
[01:36:45.220 --> 01:36:47.380]   That's his job as the CEO.
[01:36:47.380 --> 01:36:53.060]   He sees a glorious kind of utopian Star Trekian future, right?
[01:36:53.060 --> 01:36:54.060]   And I think there's actually something...
[01:36:54.060 --> 01:36:55.060]   Were there no regulators?
[01:36:55.060 --> 01:36:58.420]   Well, I think that's something that we all do aspire to.
[01:36:58.420 --> 01:37:01.340]   And I think there's something to have good intentions, but there's something else to
[01:37:01.340 --> 01:37:02.980]   have good execution.
[01:37:02.980 --> 01:37:05.820]   And I feel like Google may have both of those.
[01:37:05.820 --> 01:37:06.820]   Right.
[01:37:06.820 --> 01:37:07.820]   This is what Om said earlier.
[01:37:07.820 --> 01:37:08.820]   They're aiming at it.
[01:37:08.820 --> 01:37:10.740]   There's many companies going down this direction.
[01:37:10.740 --> 01:37:13.340]   You're like, "Mmm, well, who do you...
[01:37:13.340 --> 01:37:15.740]   Which horse do you bet on?"
[01:37:15.740 --> 01:37:18.660]   Matt Honan wrote a great place piece on Wired.
[01:37:18.660 --> 01:37:20.340]   Welcome to Google Island.
[01:37:20.340 --> 01:37:26.140]   Because Larry basically said, "We want somewhere where we don't have to worry about regulators
[01:37:26.140 --> 01:37:29.540]   and competition where you just do whatever we say."
[01:37:29.540 --> 01:37:33.420]   Well, it goes back to, you know, kind of we make our own realities.
[01:37:33.420 --> 01:37:37.780]   And it kind of goes back to the Mad Men Axiom, which is, you don't like what people are
[01:37:37.780 --> 01:37:39.900]   saying about you change the conversation.
[01:37:39.900 --> 01:37:41.100]   What do you think, Om?
[01:37:41.100 --> 01:37:42.100]   You're the cynic.
[01:37:42.100 --> 01:37:47.940]   Well, I think I'm with you on this one, Leo.
[01:37:47.940 --> 01:37:53.700]   I'm a hate to do this, but I have to be with you, but I will.
[01:37:53.700 --> 01:37:56.100]   Oh, just once.
[01:37:56.100 --> 01:37:57.100]   Come on.
[01:37:57.100 --> 01:38:06.300]   You know, after listening to Larry, and then to hearing Om's description of him showing
[01:38:06.300 --> 01:38:12.100]   this grand vision early on, it makes me want to go back and listen to Larry again knowing
[01:38:12.100 --> 01:38:17.220]   now what I heard from Om that this is something they've always had in mind.
[01:38:17.220 --> 01:38:21.100]   And they're now able to execute on it because they have the infrastructure to do it.
[01:38:21.100 --> 01:38:22.980]   That's a really interesting concept.
[01:38:22.980 --> 01:38:30.140]   And it kind of changes my impression, hearing Om of what Larry said.
[01:38:30.140 --> 01:38:35.180]   So Om, do you think that Larry is naive?
[01:38:35.180 --> 01:38:41.540]   Or do you think that he's cynically, you know, misrepresenting Google's intentions?
[01:38:41.540 --> 01:38:46.740]   Or do you think this is an aspirational speech that he understands that it's not happening,
[01:38:46.740 --> 01:38:49.300]   but he wants to live up to this?
[01:38:49.300 --> 01:38:56.900]   I think it's, you know, all people at Larry's position live in their own sense of reality.
[01:38:56.900 --> 01:39:01.260]   And I think in his reality, he thinks everybody else is wrong.
[01:39:01.260 --> 01:39:07.260]   And they're doing the right thing and they're doing leading the charge for the right reasons.
[01:39:07.260 --> 01:39:13.340]   And you know, but like the reality is a little bit more nuanced than how Larry sees it.
[01:39:13.340 --> 01:39:15.620]   But I'm not like I wrote about this.
[01:39:15.620 --> 01:39:22.220]   I pointed out a disconnect between what he said is like, let's all get together and
[01:39:22.220 --> 01:39:23.340]   you know, work together.
[01:39:23.340 --> 01:39:30.060]   And then he goes like five minutes later, he's being practiced, Microsoft and Oracle in
[01:39:30.060 --> 01:39:34.140]   the same, like, it's not even like 15 minutes.
[01:39:34.140 --> 01:39:40.780]   And he does that and he's like, okay, I'm not very clear how that really, you know,
[01:39:40.780 --> 01:39:47.660]   he amplifies this message of, you know, working together and that whole home by feeling, you
[01:39:47.660 --> 01:39:50.340]   know, we're supposed to have.
[01:39:50.340 --> 01:39:54.580]   And I think there is a huge, huge problem right now.
[01:39:54.580 --> 01:40:08.500]   And I'm not so sure, you know, I'm not so sure, like, you know, how I would think about
[01:40:08.500 --> 01:40:11.020]   this any differently.
[01:40:11.020 --> 01:40:17.580]   I think he needs a Google and Larry need to, if they want to be the leaders and statesman
[01:40:17.580 --> 01:40:25.420]   of the industry, they just need to be a little bit, you know, clear and put their actions
[01:40:25.420 --> 01:40:30.420]   have to speak more for them than just the words.
[01:40:30.420 --> 01:40:33.620]   And I think that is where we need to go.
[01:40:33.620 --> 01:40:39.020]   And you know, this is a company which is also trying to do some, you know, interesting
[01:40:39.020 --> 01:40:47.340]   things, for instance, shutting down a lot of the, you know, support for all open standards,
[01:40:47.340 --> 01:40:48.340]   right?
[01:40:48.340 --> 01:40:51.700]   Like, Google plus has no open RSS output.
[01:40:51.700 --> 01:41:00.420]   There is, you know, Google Reader is gone and within RSS future is a little bit at, you
[01:41:00.420 --> 01:41:07.620]   know, at risk now on the Google calendar, they have dropped the support for CalDAV and
[01:41:07.620 --> 01:41:10.860]   instead they're going for their own proprietary API.
[01:41:10.860 --> 01:41:13.100]   They're dropping support for XMPP.
[01:41:13.100 --> 01:41:18.060]   You know, like, if you start looking at all these things, you certainly see that, you
[01:41:18.060 --> 01:41:21.060]   know, the words and the actions don't really catch up.
[01:41:21.060 --> 01:41:30.220]   It's sort of like, I kind of feel that that is something which always unsettles me about
[01:41:30.220 --> 01:41:31.220]   Google.
[01:41:31.220 --> 01:41:36.540]   I think you're right though, the CEO is living in their own bubble and it's, he probably
[01:41:36.540 --> 01:41:38.700]   feels like, no, we're doing this.
[01:41:38.700 --> 01:41:40.500]   We're doing, we're doing all this.
[01:41:40.500 --> 01:41:42.300]   You know, I thought it was very interesting.
[01:41:42.300 --> 01:41:46.220]   Mary Jane Foley who writes about Microsoft for a ZD net and is the host of our Windows
[01:41:46.220 --> 01:41:53.380]   Weekly said, Microsoft set a trap for Google, which I thought was quite interesting.
[01:41:53.380 --> 01:41:57.460]   She was pretty clear in her mind that Microsoft knew exactly what Google would do and how
[01:41:57.460 --> 01:42:04.460]   bad it would look for Google to do it and Microsoft very cleverly set up a trap with
[01:42:04.460 --> 01:42:09.340]   this YouTube application.
[01:42:09.340 --> 01:42:13.020]   I mean, for instance, now it was one thing to say, well, there's no API, which is what
[01:42:13.020 --> 01:42:14.300]   they said.
[01:42:14.300 --> 01:42:17.900]   And so we had to write an app because we have to have a YouTube app for Windows phone.
[01:42:17.900 --> 01:42:22.980]   We're just doing what m.youtube.com, the mobile site does, but there's one little thing
[01:42:22.980 --> 01:42:26.740]   they didn't mention, which is they also allow downloads of videos in high quality, which
[01:42:26.740 --> 01:42:29.860]   YouTube has never allowed in any context.
[01:42:29.860 --> 01:42:33.180]   And I think it's her opinion that Peter Bright, who is also on the show, I think he agreed
[01:42:33.180 --> 01:42:34.460]   for Mars Technica.
[01:42:34.460 --> 01:42:39.420]   The Microsoft knew exactly what it was doing, knew that Google would have to shut it down
[01:42:39.420 --> 01:42:43.740]   for various legal reasons and that they would have to do it right about Google I/O time.
[01:42:43.740 --> 01:42:48.580]   I don't think that they knew it would be timed so closely to Larry's speech, but clever.
[01:42:48.580 --> 01:42:52.460]   But Google, Microsoft, I mean, Google didn't complain about the downloads.
[01:42:52.460 --> 01:42:54.380]   Did they just complain about the advertising?
[01:42:54.380 --> 01:42:55.380]   Yeah.
[01:42:55.380 --> 01:42:56.380]   Wouldn't that complain?
[01:42:56.380 --> 01:42:57.380]   Yeah.
[01:42:57.380 --> 01:43:00.380]   But what's interesting is that the ads are not on m.youtube.com, which is where they have
[01:43:00.380 --> 01:43:01.380]   to scrape their feed from.
[01:43:01.380 --> 01:43:04.260]   They're taking the RSS feeds.
[01:43:04.260 --> 01:43:06.060]   So I think it's very interesting.
[01:43:06.060 --> 01:43:07.060]   Who knows?
[01:43:07.060 --> 01:43:09.940]   I think that there, I think it's more nuanced than we might know.
[01:43:09.940 --> 01:43:14.300]   And I think it's very intriguing that Microsoft, who has really has been after Google with
[01:43:14.300 --> 01:43:19.140]   a screwable campaign, might have perhaps known exactly how it was going to play out and how
[01:43:19.140 --> 01:43:20.300]   bad it would look.
[01:43:20.300 --> 01:43:23.260]   I was wondering when those kind of things happen, those kind of conspiracy things have
[01:43:23.260 --> 01:43:26.700]   because I guess I don't believe people are clever enough to come up with this.
[01:43:26.700 --> 01:43:27.700]   It's just chess, baby.
[01:43:27.700 --> 01:43:30.300]   It just looks two moves ahead and the other guys looking one moves ahead.
[01:43:30.300 --> 01:43:31.300]   You got them.
[01:43:31.300 --> 01:43:32.300]   It's just chess.
[01:43:32.300 --> 01:43:36.100]   All right, one can take a break.
[01:43:36.100 --> 01:43:40.940]   Come back a couple more stories to throw in before we throw a throw down.
[01:43:40.940 --> 01:43:42.340]   I got to mention Jerry Ellsworth.
[01:43:42.340 --> 01:43:46.020]   We found out what she's been up to since Valve fired her.
[01:43:46.020 --> 01:43:47.860]   Maybe Valve made a little bit of a mistake.
[01:43:47.860 --> 01:43:49.660]   But first a word about postage.
[01:43:49.660 --> 01:43:53.180]   If you mail a lot in your business, you need to know about stamps.com.
[01:43:53.180 --> 01:43:55.060]   This is not for your Christmas card list.
[01:43:55.060 --> 01:43:56.380]   This is for somebody who mails out.
[01:43:56.380 --> 01:43:59.260]   Invoices and flyers, somebody who mails packages.
[01:43:59.260 --> 01:44:02.700]   Maybe you're an Etsy maker and you want to sell on Etsy.com.
[01:44:02.700 --> 01:44:05.140]   Maybe you sell on eBay and you do fulfillment.
[01:44:05.140 --> 01:44:09.180]   This is the best way to do it with stamps.com.
[01:44:09.180 --> 01:44:12.780]   You print your own postage for any class of mail directly from your computer and your
[01:44:12.780 --> 01:44:13.780]   printer.
[01:44:13.780 --> 01:44:14.780]   You can print on envelopes.
[01:44:14.780 --> 01:44:16.900]   You can print a label, mailing label.
[01:44:16.900 --> 01:44:22.380]   Their USB scales means you never have too little or too much postage on a package.
[01:44:22.380 --> 01:44:23.900]   It's always just right.
[01:44:23.900 --> 01:44:26.300]   They'll help you decide the best class of mail based on your needs.
[01:44:26.300 --> 01:44:27.660]   There's no guesswork at all.
[01:44:27.660 --> 01:44:29.140]   You can get it whenever you need it.
[01:44:29.140 --> 01:44:30.380]   You don't have to go to the post office.
[01:44:30.380 --> 01:44:34.340]   It's 24/7 hot and cold running US postage right from the desk.
[01:44:34.340 --> 01:44:38.940]   They even fill out the international forms, the mailing labels and everything taken directly
[01:44:38.940 --> 01:44:40.500]   from the site you use.
[01:44:40.500 --> 01:44:46.380]   Whether it's QuickBooks or PayPal or Etsy or Amazon, stamps.com.
[01:44:46.380 --> 01:44:47.500]   We've been using it for years.
[01:44:47.500 --> 01:44:50.620]   I've been using it personally for years and we use it here in the office and we love it.
[01:44:50.620 --> 01:44:52.420]   I cannot recommend it more highly.
[01:44:52.420 --> 01:44:54.380]   That's why I want you to try it.
[01:44:54.380 --> 01:44:55.460]   We've arranged a special deal.

[01:45:00.820 --> 01:45:01.820]   I don't want you to do that.
[01:45:01.820 --> 01:45:05.540]   I want you before you do anything else to click the microphone in the upper right hand

[01:45:47.980 --> 01:45:51.260]   We're talking about the news of the week.
[01:45:51.260 --> 01:45:54.500]   Jerry Ellsworth who we know well, we love Jerry.
[01:45:54.500 --> 01:45:55.500]   She is a maker.
[01:45:55.500 --> 01:45:56.500]   She was working at Steam.
[01:45:56.500 --> 01:45:59.460]   We didn't know what she was working on but we knew she was a hardware person.
[01:45:59.460 --> 01:46:01.580]   So we thought, what could she be doing for Valve?
[01:46:01.580 --> 01:46:07.780]   And the great Valve massacre of a couple of months ago when they fired 25 employees,
[01:46:07.780 --> 01:46:15.420]   the great cleansing, Jerry left and she took with her these glasses.
[01:46:15.420 --> 01:46:19.340]   Well, she was showing these glasses at Maker Faire this weekend.
[01:46:19.340 --> 01:46:20.340]   I heard.
[01:46:20.340 --> 01:46:22.180]   And it sounds very cool.
[01:46:22.180 --> 01:46:23.580]   You think you're Google Glasses cool.
[01:46:23.580 --> 01:46:26.220]   These are augmented reality glasses.
[01:46:26.220 --> 01:46:28.900]   Jerry Ellsworth and programmer Rick Johnson, she's hardware.
[01:46:28.900 --> 01:46:29.900]   He's software.
[01:46:29.900 --> 01:46:32.340]   They've been working on it for over a year at Valve.
[01:46:32.340 --> 01:46:35.780]   Apparently when they were laid off, they said, go ahead, take it.
[01:46:35.780 --> 01:46:38.340]   We don't want it.
[01:46:38.340 --> 01:46:42.620]   From the reports of people who've worn them and there's an article by Sean Hollister
[01:46:42.620 --> 01:46:44.500]   in The Verge.
[01:46:44.500 --> 01:46:46.420]   This is pretty amazing.
[01:46:46.420 --> 01:46:50.020]   It's not Google Glass or Oculus Rift.
[01:46:50.020 --> 01:46:52.100]   It projects a miniature virtual reality.
[01:46:52.100 --> 01:46:56.220]   Like that gaming environment that we were watching with the Xbox except you're in it.
[01:46:56.220 --> 01:47:02.980]   You can see and interact with it in three dimensions into the world in augmented reality.
[01:47:02.980 --> 01:47:07.380]   And so it's a little rough looking in the prototype.
[01:47:07.380 --> 01:47:09.140]   I think that's kind.
[01:47:09.140 --> 01:47:13.260]   But I know Jerry and she is a hardware wizard.
[01:47:13.260 --> 01:47:14.260]   A hardware wizard.
[01:47:14.260 --> 01:47:19.740]   And if she's figured out a way to make these, she also likes her glue gun, I admit.
[01:47:19.740 --> 01:47:21.260]   A little more than some.
[01:47:21.260 --> 01:47:27.980]   But those who tried it at the Maker Fair this weekend said it was mind boggling.
[01:47:27.980 --> 01:47:32.220]   The active shutter glasses filter out images for each of your left and right eyes 120
[01:47:32.220 --> 01:47:33.220]   times a second.
[01:47:33.220 --> 01:47:36.900]   So all the images are in 3D.
[01:47:36.900 --> 01:47:41.980]   It's a retro reflective projector screen which bounces the images into your face.
[01:47:41.980 --> 01:47:44.740]   You have miniature projectors attached.
[01:47:44.740 --> 01:47:46.580]   Here's the picture from there.
[01:47:46.580 --> 01:47:48.020]   She is, I love Jerry.
[01:47:48.020 --> 01:47:51.140]   She is brilliant.
[01:47:51.140 --> 01:47:54.340]   Untrained, brilliant engineer who can do anything.
[01:47:54.340 --> 01:47:58.380]   Here if you, Chad, I have the video from The Verge on here.
[01:47:58.380 --> 01:48:00.340]   And so you feel like you're in the space.
[01:48:00.340 --> 01:48:04.060]   Now this is, you know, as with Glass, you can't really see what it's like to be in there
[01:48:04.060 --> 01:48:05.180]   or the Oculus Rift.
[01:48:05.180 --> 01:48:08.780]   But there's all sorts of wands and things to play with.
[01:48:08.780 --> 01:48:11.820]   It's very low latency.
[01:48:11.820 --> 01:48:15.220]   And they think they'll be able to make it very cheap.
[01:48:15.220 --> 01:48:16.220]   I like this.
[01:48:16.220 --> 01:48:17.500]   I'm excited.
[01:48:17.500 --> 01:48:21.020]   And I'm thrilled to hear that Jerry got to keep the intellectual property.
[01:48:21.020 --> 01:48:23.980]   I think that, I mean, reading this article and reading some of the other articles about
[01:48:23.980 --> 01:48:25.660]   it, to hear the passion and dedication.
[01:48:25.660 --> 01:48:28.100]   I mean, I think the quote in this is, this is what I was going to build, come hell or
[01:48:28.100 --> 01:48:29.100]   high water.
[01:48:29.100 --> 01:48:30.100]   Yeah.
[01:48:30.100 --> 01:48:31.700]   This is like, they were on to something, no they were on to something.
[01:48:31.700 --> 01:48:33.740]   And just because Valve didn't agree with them isn't going to stop.
[01:48:33.740 --> 01:48:37.460]   I don't know if Gabe Newell said, okay, take it with you or if they sued or what, but
[01:48:37.460 --> 01:48:38.460]   I'm glad they got it.
[01:48:38.460 --> 01:48:43.060]   Yeah, no, it says, Valve has released any ownership or interest in the project and they're free
[01:48:43.060 --> 01:48:44.860]   to develop it as they want.
[01:48:44.860 --> 01:48:49.380]   So, I mean, so, so Valve is supposedly working on a console, right?
[01:48:49.380 --> 01:48:51.340]   Why wouldn't they want this for their console?
[01:48:51.340 --> 01:48:54.500]   Well, we thought that that's what Jerry was working on because we knew she was a hardware
[01:48:54.500 --> 01:48:55.500]   hacker.
[01:48:55.500 --> 01:48:56.500]   She's brilliant.
[01:48:56.500 --> 01:48:57.500]   Right.
[01:48:57.500 --> 01:48:59.620]   And we couldn't imagine that she was working on anything but something, not a steam box,
[01:48:59.620 --> 01:49:00.620]   but something cooler.
[01:49:00.620 --> 01:49:03.620]   I didn't realize it was this, but you'd think they'd want it.
[01:49:03.620 --> 01:49:06.900]   But you know, remember, Valve is not a hardware company.
[01:49:06.900 --> 01:49:09.820]   They might have felt they were biting off more than they could chew.
[01:49:09.820 --> 01:49:10.820]   I don't know.
[01:49:10.820 --> 01:49:12.980]   Yeah, I mean, according to hers, you know, Gabe was completely behind it.
[01:49:12.980 --> 01:49:16.100]   I talked to Gabe, he talked to lawyers and it's like, it's theirs, make it happen because
[01:49:16.100 --> 01:49:17.620]   he could see we're passionate about it.
[01:49:17.620 --> 01:49:19.300]   That's a nice story to hear.
[01:49:19.300 --> 01:49:20.300]   That's true.
[01:49:20.300 --> 01:49:21.660]   I mean, imagine running around an amaze.
[01:49:21.660 --> 01:49:23.380]   It looks like a maze except it's not.
[01:49:23.380 --> 01:49:25.980]   It's a field and shooting at people.
[01:49:25.980 --> 01:49:27.660]   They had the Verge.
[01:49:27.660 --> 01:49:35.660]   Sean talked about playing a virtual Jenga game with a sword knocking giant blocks a tower.
[01:49:35.660 --> 01:49:36.660]   Good for them.
[01:49:36.660 --> 01:49:37.660]   Glad they got it.
[01:49:37.660 --> 01:49:40.820]   I think that's really fantastic.
[01:49:40.820 --> 01:49:41.820]   Let's see.
[01:49:41.820 --> 01:49:46.020]   I'm just checking through those stories, the dregs, you know, the bottom of the barrel,
[01:49:46.020 --> 01:49:47.020]   what's left.
[01:49:47.020 --> 01:49:51.700]   Nintendo kicks the Let's Play videos off YouTube, then puts it, lets them back and puts ads
[01:49:51.700 --> 01:49:52.700]   on them.
[01:49:52.700 --> 01:49:54.660]   We talked about it in our This Week in YouTube show.
[01:49:54.660 --> 01:49:56.820]   Chad, you were pretty upset about that.
[01:49:56.820 --> 01:49:57.820]   Yeah.
[01:49:57.820 --> 01:50:02.420]   These are videos where people are playing a game and they shoot video of them playing
[01:50:02.420 --> 01:50:10.420]   a game, kind of like Twitch.tv.
[01:50:10.420 --> 01:50:12.260]   Such a no-brainer.
[01:50:12.260 --> 01:50:13.260]   What's wrong?
[01:50:13.260 --> 01:50:15.100]   Lawyers ruin the world.
[01:50:15.100 --> 01:50:17.860]   That's probably what Larry Page was trying to say, but didn't want to say in so many
[01:50:17.860 --> 01:50:18.860]   words.
[01:50:18.860 --> 01:50:22.420]   There's no lawyers on that island, on Google Island.
[01:50:22.420 --> 01:50:26.500]   Is this where the Leroy Jenkins video came from?
[01:50:26.500 --> 01:50:29.380]   That was a great, that was a great, that was awesome.
[01:50:29.380 --> 01:50:30.380]   That was what they did.
[01:50:30.380 --> 01:50:31.380]   I loved that.
[01:50:31.380 --> 01:50:32.780]   Seven years ago.
[01:50:32.780 --> 01:50:37.540]   And then but Ms. Shinnima, Blue vs Blue, all of that stuff is kind of the same idea.
[01:50:37.540 --> 01:50:38.660]   Yeah, my son is 12.
[01:50:38.660 --> 01:50:40.780]   He loves watching these YouTube videos.
[01:50:40.780 --> 01:50:41.780]   Minecraft videos.
[01:50:41.780 --> 01:50:43.420]   He likes watching Minecraft videos.
[01:50:43.420 --> 01:50:46.780]   There are people talking over them and it's the best thing for Minecraft ever.
[01:50:46.780 --> 01:50:50.060]   I mean, Minecraft guys would never take down the three videos.
[01:50:50.060 --> 01:50:53.940]   Well, they have actually officially said that they won't take down those videos.
[01:50:53.940 --> 01:50:58.180]   YouTube came to them asking, "Would you like half of the revenue from anyone who makes
[01:50:58.180 --> 01:50:59.180]   a Let's Play?"
[01:50:59.180 --> 01:51:00.180]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:51:00.180 --> 01:51:01.540]   No, we would not like that money.
[01:51:01.540 --> 01:51:02.540]   Good for notch.
[01:51:02.540 --> 01:51:03.540]   Yeah.
[01:51:03.540 --> 01:51:06.420]   And so it's interesting to see that they say no and then Nintendo is like, "Yes!"
[01:51:06.420 --> 01:51:07.420]   Blue.
[01:51:07.420 --> 01:51:09.260]   And the Nintendo will take any money they can get at this point.
[01:51:09.260 --> 01:51:10.420]   Nintendo leads the money.
[01:51:10.420 --> 01:51:14.220]   They're looking at their pivot table of Wii U sales and they're going, "Well, hey, you
[01:51:14.220 --> 01:51:16.620]   know, we got to take where we get."
[01:51:16.620 --> 01:51:20.180]   It doesn't look like Yahoo is going to offer us a $1.5 billion.
[01:51:20.180 --> 01:51:22.700]   So let's take the money.
[01:51:22.700 --> 01:51:25.540]   Microsoft Blue is going to be free.
[01:51:25.540 --> 01:51:28.540]   Windows Blue, which is actually going to be Windows 8.1.
[01:51:28.540 --> 01:51:33.100]   Microsoft now says we'll be a free upgrade later this year and a good thing for those
[01:51:33.100 --> 01:51:36.900]   of us who've been suffering with Windows 8.
[01:51:36.900 --> 01:51:39.940]   We don't know exactly what it'll be in Blue, but I think a lot of it will be addressing
[01:51:39.940 --> 01:51:45.260]   the complaints people have had about the Windows 8 user interface, putting a start button
[01:51:45.260 --> 01:51:46.260]   on.
[01:51:46.260 --> 01:51:52.580]   It's not a start menu, but it's a start putting the boot to desktop option back in.
[01:51:52.580 --> 01:51:53.580]   We shall see.
[01:51:53.580 --> 01:51:57.540]   But the good news is it's going to be treated as basically as a big upgrade.
[01:51:57.540 --> 01:52:03.620]   You know, HP has started including on its desktop and maybe on its notebook computers,
[01:52:03.620 --> 01:52:06.180]   something called HP Quick Start.
[01:52:06.180 --> 01:52:09.820]   And it brings back on the Windows 8 desktop, the start menu.
[01:52:09.820 --> 01:52:12.100]   It looks exactly like the start menu.
[01:52:12.100 --> 01:52:14.980]   You can drag and drop the applications.
[01:52:14.980 --> 01:52:16.660]   You want to use regularly into it.
[01:52:16.660 --> 01:52:18.740]   It works pretty much the same way.
[01:52:18.740 --> 01:52:24.500]   And they're replacing it, even though it's not officially for Microsoft.
[01:52:24.500 --> 01:52:26.900]   And look what Dell's quarterly results were.
[01:52:26.900 --> 01:52:29.660]   They were way, way down.
[01:52:29.660 --> 01:52:30.900]   The PC industry is suffering.
[01:52:30.900 --> 01:52:36.140]   A lot of them like to say, "Oh, it's moved to tablet, but I got to think Windows 8 and
[01:52:36.140 --> 01:52:39.300]   its lack of support is really hurting it."
[01:52:39.300 --> 01:52:41.580]   I got to think that.
[01:52:41.580 --> 01:52:43.140]   I'm the only one using a Windows device.
[01:52:43.140 --> 01:52:45.660]   Yeah, I haven't touched a Windows device in years.
[01:52:45.660 --> 01:52:47.980]   I feel bad because I used to be a PC guy.
[01:52:47.980 --> 01:52:49.140]   I was totally a Windows guy.
[01:52:49.140 --> 01:52:51.340]   I was totally on board and I didn't like it.
[01:52:51.340 --> 01:52:54.860]   And then I switched to Mac and I never looked back.
[01:52:54.860 --> 01:52:57.860]   I used to think Mac people were just annoying and awful.
[01:52:57.860 --> 01:52:58.860]   Me too.
[01:52:58.860 --> 01:52:59.860]   But here's a question.
[01:52:59.860 --> 01:53:02.900]   This is a little bit meta.
[01:53:02.900 --> 01:53:04.380]   You and I were hardcore PC guys.
[01:53:04.380 --> 01:53:05.860]   I have a feeling you built your own PC.
[01:53:05.860 --> 01:53:07.940]   You'd gain between your 3D FX cards.
[01:53:07.940 --> 01:53:08.940]   You'd get your FPS.
[01:53:08.940 --> 01:53:09.940]   3DFX.
[01:53:09.940 --> 01:53:10.940]   Yeah.
[01:53:10.940 --> 01:53:13.340]   You'd get your FPS as high as you could in Kuwait.
[01:53:13.340 --> 01:53:14.340]   You'd be over-coated.
[01:53:14.340 --> 01:53:15.340]   I have a seller on.
[01:53:15.340 --> 01:53:16.340]   All that stuff.
[01:53:16.340 --> 01:53:17.740]   We made the jump to Mac.
[01:53:17.740 --> 01:53:18.900]   We're happy.
[01:53:18.900 --> 01:53:20.860]   Why hasn't these other people?
[01:53:20.860 --> 01:53:22.740]   They're some of these better PC people.
[01:53:22.740 --> 01:53:23.740]   Business.
[01:53:23.740 --> 01:53:24.740]   I'll tell you why.
[01:53:24.740 --> 01:53:28.140]   Look at Lisa over here who's doing all her spreadsheets on Excel.
[01:53:28.140 --> 01:53:30.260]   She's not going to use Excel on a Mac.
[01:53:30.260 --> 01:53:31.260]   I do.
[01:53:31.260 --> 01:53:32.260]   She's using QuickBooks.
[01:53:32.260 --> 01:53:33.260]   I moved my business stuff.
[01:53:33.260 --> 01:53:34.260]   I think for me, which changed-
[01:53:34.260 --> 01:53:35.260]   She's sitting in front of an iPad.
[01:53:35.260 --> 01:53:36.980]   And she just bought a MacBook Air.
[01:53:36.980 --> 01:53:42.980]   But other than that, if you look down Business Isle here, it's all Dell's.
[01:53:42.980 --> 01:53:44.160]   It's all-
[01:53:44.160 --> 01:53:45.160]   Oh, God.
[01:53:45.160 --> 01:53:46.160]   Yeah.
[01:53:46.160 --> 01:53:47.160]   Well, I think business has-
[01:53:47.160 --> 01:53:49.860]   I think that was the case five years ago, but I think business has crossed over.
[01:53:49.860 --> 01:53:50.860]   For me, it's been-
[01:53:50.860 --> 01:53:51.860]   Right.
[01:53:51.860 --> 01:53:53.700]   My uses have been- I've been gaming less.
[01:53:53.700 --> 01:53:55.980]   So the need for the 3D FX card, stuff like that.
[01:53:55.980 --> 01:53:59.380]   And that gaming has moved to consoles or to tablets or phones.
[01:53:59.380 --> 01:54:00.780]   And I've been doing a lot more media production.
[01:54:00.780 --> 01:54:03.140]   I've been doing a lot more video editing, audio editing, which is for sure.
[01:54:03.140 --> 01:54:04.140]   This may have been-
[01:54:04.140 --> 01:54:05.140]   This may be where it flips.
[01:54:05.140 --> 01:54:06.140]   Yeah.
[01:54:06.140 --> 01:54:07.940]   You know, Windows 8 really is- is for a lot.
[01:54:07.940 --> 01:54:10.300]   Now every time I say this, I get a lot of email people.
[01:54:10.300 --> 01:54:11.540]   I don't know what you're talking about.
[01:54:11.540 --> 01:54:12.540]   I love Windows 8.
[01:54:12.540 --> 01:54:13.540]   I understand it.
[01:54:13.540 --> 01:54:14.540]   It works great for me.
[01:54:14.540 --> 01:54:17.020]   But I think that- that- certainly a lot of you love it.
[01:54:17.020 --> 01:54:21.540]   But there's plenty of people who are- most people who are not having a good time and
[01:54:21.540 --> 01:54:22.540]   they want Windows 7.
[01:54:22.540 --> 01:54:28.740]   So, so Lee, I've been using Windows 8 on a desktop HP NV23.
[01:54:28.740 --> 01:54:30.060]   Which is really nice.
[01:54:30.060 --> 01:54:33.580]   And the more I use Windows 8, I also have it on a home-built box.
[01:54:33.580 --> 01:54:36.300]   And the more I use it, the more I like it.
[01:54:36.300 --> 01:54:38.780]   Mainly because I've got the right tools for it.
[01:54:38.780 --> 01:54:42.860]   So for example, there's a Logitech touchpad that's designed for Windows 8.
[01:54:42.860 --> 01:54:44.940]   But definitely right.
[01:54:44.940 --> 01:54:49.060]   And I think if you're even on a notebook computer where it's a small screen and you're kind
[01:54:49.060 --> 01:54:54.460]   of reaching up and trying to do something on a little screen, but on a big desktop,
[01:54:54.460 --> 01:54:56.340]   it's very cool to use.
[01:54:56.340 --> 01:55:01.140]   And if you think differently about Windows 8, it's not- it isn't so bad.
[01:55:01.140 --> 01:55:04.500]   But people have a hard time thinking differently when for years and years and years.
[01:55:04.500 --> 01:55:05.500]   Maybe that's it.
[01:55:05.500 --> 01:55:07.260]   Then you start button and start menu.
[01:55:07.260 --> 01:55:08.860]   It requires a different way of thinking.
[01:55:08.860 --> 01:55:10.740]   Well, part of it is that you just want to be productive.
[01:55:10.740 --> 01:55:11.740]   You just want it to work.
[01:55:11.740 --> 01:55:13.460]   You want to sit down and sort of know what to do.
[01:55:13.460 --> 01:55:16.820]   And if you change the paradigm really dramatically, you take away that thing that people have
[01:55:16.820 --> 01:55:18.220]   clutched onto a start button.
[01:55:18.220 --> 01:55:19.220]   Right.
[01:55:19.220 --> 01:55:22.820]   You know, that affects the way they do work and then it affects their opinion.
[01:55:22.820 --> 01:55:26.500]   I actually broke down and got the Dell that runs Linux.
[01:55:26.500 --> 01:55:27.940]   The Dell XPS.
[01:55:27.940 --> 01:55:31.260]   So I should say that I'm also a Mac user.
[01:55:31.260 --> 01:55:36.620]   I started my column in the '90s as a Windows columnist.
[01:55:36.620 --> 01:55:40.500]   We had a separate Mac columnist, Bob Levitez was a Mac columnist.
[01:55:40.500 --> 01:55:47.540]   And I kind of moved over about the mid-2000s and I'm now running almost full time on a
[01:55:47.540 --> 01:55:52.940]   Mac and when I'm on Windows, it's at work or it's on these secondary machines.
[01:55:52.940 --> 01:55:59.500]   But what's funny is people just think you're a traitor when you've made that shift.
[01:55:59.500 --> 01:56:02.460]   And I don't understand the anger that's still there.
[01:56:02.460 --> 01:56:04.540]   It's very '90s to me.
[01:56:04.540 --> 01:56:07.020]   I have to say one thing.
[01:56:07.020 --> 01:56:11.660]   The Lumia 928 came out on Verizon and I got a unit this week.
[01:56:11.660 --> 01:56:16.060]   Actually, Windows Phone is probably the best version of Windows.
[01:56:16.060 --> 01:56:20.100]   The best way to run it, not on a tablet, not on a laptop, not on a desktop, but on a phone
[01:56:20.100 --> 01:56:21.660]   it's great.
[01:56:21.660 --> 01:56:25.820]   It's really beautiful and it works and it's effective and it's smooth.
[01:56:25.820 --> 01:56:27.540]   So it's a good phone.
[01:56:27.540 --> 01:56:28.540]   I'm not going to switch to it.
[01:56:28.540 --> 01:56:29.540]   It's a great piece of hardware.
[01:56:29.540 --> 01:56:33.300]   I mean, I don't know if I agree with the OS, but the hardware itself is nice.
[01:56:33.300 --> 01:56:36.980]   Well, it's cleaner than, you know, I'm an Android user and it's just cleaner than Android.
[01:56:36.980 --> 01:56:38.420]   Android is kind of a hodgepodge.
[01:56:38.420 --> 01:56:42.140]   Each Android phone has its own unique bizarre interface and so forth.
[01:56:42.140 --> 01:56:47.380]   So the unity that Microsoft's been able to enforce with its manufacturers, Windows Phone
[01:56:47.380 --> 01:56:51.700]   is Windows Phone no matter who you buy, I think helps a lot.
[01:56:51.700 --> 01:56:53.660]   Well, we're going to let you all go.
[01:56:53.660 --> 01:56:55.780]   Oh, Malek, so great to have you.
[01:56:55.780 --> 01:56:57.260]   GigaOM.com.
[01:56:57.260 --> 01:56:58.420]   Everybody must read.
[01:56:58.420 --> 01:57:05.580]   And if you're a pro, go to pro.gigaOM.com and subscribe to Om Research.
[01:57:05.580 --> 01:57:08.260]   Om Suite Om.
[01:57:08.260 --> 01:57:09.340]   Thank you, Leo.
[01:57:09.340 --> 01:57:10.340]   So nice to see you.
[01:57:10.340 --> 01:57:11.540]   We really appreciate your being here.
[01:57:11.540 --> 01:57:13.740]   We've been trying to get Om on the show for how long Chad?
[01:57:13.740 --> 01:57:15.500]   Six months.
[01:57:15.500 --> 01:57:18.060]   He's resisted every, I've sent him flowers.
[01:57:18.060 --> 01:57:20.060]   He's been very accommodating.
[01:57:20.060 --> 01:57:21.060]   We're glad.
[01:57:21.060 --> 01:57:22.220]   You're going to be bacon.
[01:57:22.220 --> 01:57:23.980]   You travel a lot and bacon you want.
[01:57:23.980 --> 01:57:24.980]   You can't eat bacon.
[01:57:24.980 --> 01:57:25.980]   I'm not going to let you eat bacon.
[01:57:25.980 --> 01:57:26.980]   I know.
[01:57:26.980 --> 01:57:28.980]   That's why you just hand me a ting-ting-ting-ting use.
[01:57:28.980 --> 01:57:30.900]   Ah, no more bacon from Om.
[01:57:30.900 --> 01:57:32.180]   Make a note of that.
[01:57:32.180 --> 01:57:33.180]   Thank you, Om.
[01:57:33.180 --> 01:57:34.180]   Great to have you.
[01:57:34.180 --> 01:57:36.180]   If we just love you, too.
[01:57:36.180 --> 01:57:37.180]   Thank you.
[01:57:37.180 --> 01:57:39.340]   And I'm glad you-- what's up for you?
[01:57:39.340 --> 01:57:41.980]   You've got the new Android version of Stuck on Earth.
[01:57:41.980 --> 01:57:42.980]   That's awesome.
[01:57:42.980 --> 01:57:44.340]   Yeah, we just released that.
[01:57:44.340 --> 01:57:48.220]   We've got-- every day, we put up a new photo on the website.
[01:57:48.220 --> 01:57:50.540]   I talked about Google+, and Stuck in Custom Stuck.
[01:57:50.540 --> 01:57:51.780]   Yeah, all those things.
[01:57:51.780 --> 01:57:52.780]   We put up new videos all the time.
[01:57:52.780 --> 01:57:54.820]   We've got a ton of free resources.
[01:57:54.820 --> 01:57:59.500]   And one thing we did just release, which people are excited about, is we had a big event
[01:57:59.500 --> 01:58:00.860]   in New Zealand.
[01:58:00.860 --> 01:58:03.060]   And a lot of people came out.
[01:58:03.060 --> 01:58:04.340]   Did a big photography workshop.
[01:58:04.340 --> 01:58:05.540]   Was it in Queenstown or?
[01:58:05.540 --> 01:58:07.900]   It was in Queenstown and all around the South Island.
[01:58:07.900 --> 01:58:11.460]   Did you have a workshop in Queenstown and you didn't invite me?
[01:58:11.460 --> 01:58:12.460]   I think I--
[01:58:12.460 --> 01:58:13.460]   Did you?
[01:58:13.460 --> 01:58:14.460]   Did in my end.
[01:58:14.460 --> 01:58:15.460]   I got to check my email one of these days.
[01:58:15.460 --> 01:58:16.460]   Because I would love--
[01:58:16.460 --> 01:58:17.460]   That would be fun.
[01:58:17.460 --> 01:58:19.020]   Yeah, no, it was a great time.
[01:58:19.020 --> 01:58:20.660]   We had 20 people come down.
[01:58:20.660 --> 01:58:23.300]   And while they were down there, we had a video crew with us.
[01:58:23.300 --> 01:58:24.300]   So they recorded everything.
[01:58:24.300 --> 01:58:25.300]   Oh, neat.
[01:58:25.300 --> 01:58:28.820]   And so it's a nice four or five hour landscape tutorial that we just released.
[01:58:28.820 --> 01:58:30.060]   Oh, so I can see it.
[01:58:30.060 --> 01:58:31.460]   So that's in the website.
[01:58:31.460 --> 01:58:32.580]   Yeah, it's beautiful.
[01:58:32.580 --> 01:58:33.580]   And it doesn't matter.
[01:58:33.580 --> 01:58:34.780]   It could be any place.
[01:58:34.780 --> 01:58:37.380]   But it might give you some ideas of coming to New Zealand.
[01:58:37.380 --> 01:58:38.980]   Because it is a beautiful place.
[01:58:38.980 --> 01:58:39.980]   I'm really happy.
[01:58:39.980 --> 01:58:43.620]   Trey, who could live anywhere in the world, has decided to keep his family in Queenstown.
[01:58:43.620 --> 01:58:44.980]   Yeah, we're very happy down there.
[01:58:44.980 --> 01:58:45.980]   It's nice.
[01:58:45.980 --> 01:58:47.700]   My son takes a snowboard to school every Thursday.
[01:58:47.700 --> 01:58:48.700]   Oh, geez.
[01:58:48.700 --> 01:58:50.940]   Well, winter's coming.
[01:58:50.940 --> 01:58:51.940]   Winter is coming.
[01:58:51.940 --> 01:58:53.100]   Winter is coming.
[01:58:53.100 --> 01:58:55.220]   Did you get Game of Thrones down there?
[01:58:55.220 --> 01:58:56.740]   Wait, yeah, we have got BitTorrent.
[01:58:56.740 --> 01:58:59.740]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:58:59.740 --> 01:59:01.980]   No, I've got 30 megabits.
[01:59:01.980 --> 01:59:03.620]   And up and down into my place.
[01:59:03.620 --> 01:59:04.620]   Oh, wow.
[01:59:04.620 --> 01:59:06.980]   Yeah, I wouldn't go anywhere that I didn't have a good bandwidth.
[01:59:06.980 --> 01:59:08.500]   Yeah, that's the prerequisite.
[01:59:08.500 --> 01:59:09.500]   That's so slow.
[01:59:09.500 --> 01:59:10.500]   Oh, shut up.
[01:59:10.500 --> 01:59:11.500]   What do you have?
[01:59:11.500 --> 01:59:13.060]   What do you have, home?
[01:59:13.060 --> 01:59:14.820]   200 megabits up and down.
[01:59:14.820 --> 01:59:15.820]   In your house?
[01:59:15.820 --> 01:59:16.820]   In my house.
[01:59:16.820 --> 01:59:17.820]   That's so cool.
[01:59:17.820 --> 01:59:19.740]   That's more than we have in the studio.
[01:59:19.740 --> 01:59:20.740]   What can I say?
[01:59:20.740 --> 01:59:22.780]   That's why it looks so good on the screen right now.
[01:59:22.780 --> 01:59:24.020]   200 megabits.
[01:59:24.020 --> 01:59:25.020]   Who is it fiber?
[01:59:25.020 --> 01:59:26.020]   Is it fiber?
[01:59:26.020 --> 01:59:27.020]   What is it?
[01:59:27.020 --> 01:59:28.020]   It is fiber from WebPass.
[01:59:28.020 --> 01:59:34.900]   It is a localized fee and they only have a few buildings in Soma.
[01:59:34.900 --> 01:59:36.860]   But they do a spectacular job.
[01:59:36.860 --> 01:59:39.340]   They write up the entire building.
[01:59:39.340 --> 01:59:42.740]   And that's one thing I don't mind spending money on.
[01:59:42.740 --> 01:59:46.340]   So just, you know, you don't have to tell me, but I'm going to ask how much?
[01:59:46.340 --> 01:59:47.340]   $50 a month.
[01:59:47.340 --> 01:59:48.340]   What?
[01:59:48.340 --> 01:59:49.340]   Shut the front door.
[01:59:49.340 --> 01:59:50.340]   I hate you.
[01:59:50.340 --> 01:59:51.340]   I hate you.
[01:59:51.340 --> 01:59:52.340]   I hate you.
[01:59:52.340 --> 01:59:54.340]   You can come up with a little slide out.
[01:59:54.340 --> 01:59:58.220]   $50 a month for 200 megabits.
[01:59:58.220 --> 01:59:59.500]   Yes, sir.
[01:59:59.500 --> 02:00:01.900]   Is it only in your building?
[02:00:01.900 --> 02:00:02.900]   Is it only in Soma?
[02:00:02.900 --> 02:00:06.900]   It's only in Cuz I mean, I'm in Hayes Valley and that's right near Soma.
[02:00:06.900 --> 02:00:07.900]   It's not in Hayes Valley.
[02:00:07.900 --> 02:00:09.620]   It has to be in your building.
[02:00:09.620 --> 02:00:15.100]   Some of the newer buildings in Dogpatch and, you know, it's like these guys are a small
[02:00:15.100 --> 02:00:17.700]   bootstrap company and they're doing some amazing stuff.
[02:00:17.700 --> 02:00:20.460]   Lisa, how much do we pay for 150 megabits in Soma?
[02:00:20.460 --> 02:00:21.460]   5000 a month?
[02:00:21.460 --> 02:00:22.460]   Yeah.
[02:00:22.460 --> 02:00:24.260]   What's our bandwidth bill?
[02:00:24.260 --> 02:00:27.220]   4,500 a month.
[02:00:27.220 --> 02:00:29.980]   We could move to San Francisco and save $4,500.
[02:00:29.980 --> 02:00:33.980]   Now you would still pay as much money if you're a business.
[02:00:33.980 --> 02:00:34.980]   Oh.
[02:00:34.980 --> 02:00:36.980]   If you're a residential customer, it's cheaper.
[02:00:36.980 --> 02:00:37.980]   Two hundred.
[02:00:37.980 --> 02:00:38.980]   Any data caps?
[02:00:38.980 --> 02:00:39.980]   What is that?
[02:00:39.980 --> 02:00:41.980]   No, you don't have to.
[02:00:41.980 --> 02:00:43.620]   How could they have data caps?
[02:00:43.620 --> 02:00:46.380]   They couldn't even do that.
[02:00:46.380 --> 02:00:47.780]   You're already faster than the internet.
[02:00:47.780 --> 02:00:50.020]   You could download the whole internet at that speed.
[02:00:50.020 --> 02:00:51.020]   Wow.
[02:00:51.020 --> 02:00:54.020]   My Wi-Fi router is slower than the network.
[02:00:54.020 --> 02:00:55.020]   Yeah.
[02:00:55.020 --> 02:00:56.020]   Wow.
[02:00:56.020 --> 02:00:59.820]   I'm looking at webpass.net.
[02:00:59.820 --> 02:01:02.340]   San Francisco Oakland, San Diego, Emery, Villan, Berkeley.
[02:01:02.340 --> 02:01:03.340]   I'm moving to what?
[02:01:03.340 --> 02:01:04.340]   Forget Google fiber.
[02:01:04.340 --> 02:01:05.340]   I'm moving there.
[02:01:05.340 --> 02:01:06.340]   It's not as fast though.
[02:01:06.340 --> 02:01:07.780]   I could have Austin instead.
[02:01:07.780 --> 02:01:08.780]   It's still pretty good.
[02:01:08.780 --> 02:01:10.620]   But you're not going to Austin, dude.
[02:01:10.620 --> 02:01:11.620]   No, I'm staying here.
[02:01:11.620 --> 02:01:12.780]   I'll never see you.
[02:01:12.780 --> 02:01:14.020]   I'm going to Petaloma.
[02:01:14.020 --> 02:01:15.020]   This is it.
[02:01:15.020 --> 02:01:16.020]   I'm done.
[02:01:16.020 --> 02:01:17.020]   I'm stuck here.
[02:01:17.020 --> 02:01:18.020]   I don't care.
[02:01:18.020 --> 02:01:19.020]   It's hot in the house there.
[02:01:19.020 --> 02:01:20.620]   We got 150 megabits in the bedroom.
[02:01:20.620 --> 02:01:21.620]   I shouldn't complain.
[02:01:21.620 --> 02:01:22.620]   We have fiber in here.
[02:01:22.620 --> 02:01:26.620]   We actually had to have Comcast trench all the way down the block, all the way down the
[02:01:26.620 --> 02:01:27.620]   street.
[02:01:27.620 --> 02:01:30.220]   So everybody in this area gets fiber thanks to us.
[02:01:30.220 --> 02:01:32.180]   You can thank me later.
[02:01:32.180 --> 02:01:33.180]   Mr. Ron Richards.
[02:01:33.180 --> 02:01:34.180]   Yes.
[02:01:34.180 --> 02:01:35.180]   Thank you, sir.
[02:01:35.180 --> 02:01:36.180]   What's your bandwidth at home?
[02:01:36.180 --> 02:01:37.180]   I get 50 down from Comcast.
[02:01:37.180 --> 02:01:38.180]   Oh, shut up.
[02:01:38.180 --> 02:01:39.180]   They just opted to 50.
[02:01:39.180 --> 02:01:42.380]   But I pay $69 on paying for a year.
[02:01:42.380 --> 02:01:45.660]   Science is the new rock and roll, says his t-shirt.
[02:01:45.660 --> 02:01:46.660]   It's awesome.
[02:01:46.660 --> 02:01:49.100]   Host about all about Android, which is every Thursday.
[02:01:49.100 --> 02:01:50.100]   Every Tuesday.
[02:01:50.100 --> 02:01:51.100]   I always get the day.
[02:01:51.100 --> 02:01:52.100]   It's a very specific time.
[02:01:52.100 --> 02:01:53.100]   I have too many shows now.
[02:01:53.100 --> 02:01:54.100]   I don't know when anything's on.
[02:01:54.100 --> 02:01:55.100]   It's great with Gina.
[02:01:55.100 --> 02:01:56.100]   Gina and Jason.
[02:01:56.100 --> 02:01:57.100]   Jason.
[02:01:57.100 --> 02:01:58.100]   Yeah, it's a fun time.
[02:01:58.100 --> 02:01:59.820]   We got a fun little community.
[02:01:59.820 --> 02:02:00.820]   Really, really, really good show.
[02:02:00.820 --> 02:02:02.100]   Yeah, it's one of our best shows, actually.
[02:02:02.100 --> 02:02:03.100]   I'm proud of it.
[02:02:03.100 --> 02:02:04.100]   I love it.
[02:02:04.100 --> 02:02:05.100]   It's a high point of my week.
[02:02:05.100 --> 02:02:06.100]   Dwight Silverman.
[02:02:06.100 --> 02:02:11.300]   He is, of course, the blogger at the Houston Chronicle blog.cron.com/techblog.
[02:02:11.300 --> 02:02:14.620]   And every Wednesday night hosts a show called Tech-- what is it?
[02:02:14.620 --> 02:02:15.620]   Reality Bites?
[02:02:15.620 --> 02:02:16.620]   Technology Bites.
[02:02:16.620 --> 02:02:17.620]   Technology Bites.
[02:02:17.620 --> 02:02:18.620]   Reality Bites, too.
[02:02:18.620 --> 02:02:21.420]   Yeah, eight o'clock Central Time.
[02:02:21.420 --> 02:02:24.580]   And it's on kpft.org if you want to stream it.
[02:02:24.580 --> 02:02:28.580]   It's also available as a podcast from iTunes.
[02:02:28.580 --> 02:02:31.020]   And we also have our two websites now.
[02:02:31.020 --> 02:02:32.260]   We've got cron.com.
[02:02:32.260 --> 02:02:38.060]   And we've got our premium site, Houston Chronicle.com.
[02:02:38.060 --> 02:02:39.060]   Awesome.
[02:02:39.060 --> 02:02:43.420]   And we really ought to get webpasts.net some better bandwidth because--
[02:02:43.420 --> 02:02:45.420]   Site is down.
[02:02:45.420 --> 02:02:46.420]   Oh, no.
[02:02:46.420 --> 02:02:48.420]   The chat room's complaining.
[02:02:48.420 --> 02:02:49.420]   Site went down.
[02:02:49.420 --> 02:02:50.940]   Site went down.
[02:02:50.940 --> 02:02:51.980]   Well, that's what happens.
[02:02:51.980 --> 02:02:53.820]   You can have 200 megabits, but it's not
[02:02:53.820 --> 02:02:55.300]   going to save you from the Twitter army.
[02:02:55.300 --> 02:02:57.540]   Thank you, Twitter army, for joining us.
[02:02:57.540 --> 02:02:58.740]   We appreciate it.
[02:02:58.740 --> 02:03:00.860]   We couldn't do this show without you each and every week.
[02:03:00.860 --> 02:03:03.300]   We do it live, and we invite you to watch live.
[02:03:03.300 --> 02:03:04.660]   Right after this week in YouTube, it's
[02:03:04.660 --> 02:03:08.420]   right about 3 p.m. Pacific, 6 p.m. Eastern Time,
[02:03:08.420 --> 02:03:11.380]   2,200 UTC on twit.tv.
[02:03:11.380 --> 02:03:14.980]   But if you can't watch live, we make on-demand versions
[02:03:14.980 --> 02:03:17.940]   available after the fact of audio and video
[02:03:17.940 --> 02:03:21.700]   at twit.tv and, of course, wherever you get your internet
[02:03:21.700 --> 02:03:25.540]   content, like iTunes, Zoom Pass, all that stuff, Xbox Pass,
[02:03:25.540 --> 02:03:26.580]   that kind of thing.
[02:03:26.580 --> 02:03:27.940]   Zoom, Google.
[02:03:27.940 --> 02:03:29.020]   What is it live?
[02:03:29.020 --> 02:03:29.780]   Google Play.
[02:03:29.780 --> 02:03:31.620]   What is it live pass?
[02:03:31.620 --> 02:03:32.140]   All access.
[02:03:32.140 --> 02:03:32.660]   All access.
[02:03:32.660 --> 02:03:35.940]   It's even that's the same name that Microsoft uses all access.
[02:03:35.940 --> 02:03:36.780]   What does that?
[02:03:36.780 --> 02:03:38.620]   It seems they use Xbox music.
[02:03:38.620 --> 02:03:39.340]   OK.
[02:03:39.340 --> 02:03:39.620]   All right.
[02:03:39.620 --> 02:03:40.740]   Lots is great, by the way.
[02:03:40.740 --> 02:03:41.780]   Google, do you like all access?
[02:03:41.780 --> 02:03:42.660]   We need to talk about that.
[02:03:42.660 --> 02:03:43.340]   We've got to--
[02:03:43.340 --> 02:03:44.420]   Cancel my audio account.
[02:03:44.420 --> 02:03:44.980]   Cancel my Spotify.
[02:03:44.980 --> 02:03:46.260]   You know, I can't cancel Spotify
[02:03:46.260 --> 02:03:47.300]   until they have it on Sonos.
[02:03:47.300 --> 02:03:49.140]   As soon as they have it on Sonos, I'm done.
[02:03:49.140 --> 02:03:49.660]   Yeah.
[02:03:49.660 --> 02:03:51.060]   That's all I need.
[02:03:51.060 --> 02:03:51.700]   I do like it because--
[02:03:51.700 --> 02:03:53.260]   Spotify is on Sonos.
[02:03:53.260 --> 02:03:53.980]   Spotify is.
[02:03:53.980 --> 02:03:55.540]   No, that's why I have Sonos.
[02:03:55.540 --> 02:03:57.140]   You like Sonos?
[02:03:57.140 --> 02:03:57.740]   I love Sonos.
[02:03:57.740 --> 02:03:58.220]   I know.
[02:03:58.220 --> 02:04:00.060]   I can't live without it.
[02:04:00.060 --> 02:04:02.180]   I have it in every room.
[02:04:02.180 --> 02:04:05.180]   But if Google doesn't put their all access on it,
[02:04:05.180 --> 02:04:07.180]   they're going to help me.
[02:04:07.180 --> 02:04:08.180]   Thanks for joining us.
[02:04:08.180 --> 02:04:09.060]   We'll see you next time.
[02:04:09.060 --> 02:04:10.700]   Another twit is in the can.
[02:04:10.700 --> 02:04:12.700]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:04:12.700 --> 02:04:13.500]   Do it the twit.
[02:04:13.500 --> 02:04:14.500]   All right.
[02:04:14.500 --> 02:04:16.380]   Do it the twit, baby.
[02:04:16.380 --> 02:04:17.380]   Do it the twit.
[02:04:17.380 --> 02:04:18.980]   I play the what's on twit.
[02:04:18.980 --> 02:04:20.340]   Oh, I forgot our promo.
[02:04:20.340 --> 02:04:22.580]   Hey, if you missed twit, this is what you--
[02:04:22.580 --> 02:04:23.620]   you didn't miss [BLEEP]
[02:04:23.620 --> 02:04:24.620]   No.
[02:04:24.620 --> 02:04:25.780]   That's not the slogan.
[02:04:25.780 --> 02:04:26.660]   What is the slogan?
[02:04:26.660 --> 02:04:34.580]   Let's see what you missed if you didn't watch Twit this week.
[02:04:34.580 --> 02:04:37.820]   Previously on Twit, Twit Live Specials.
[02:04:37.820 --> 02:04:38.660]   Hi, I'm Tom Merritt.
[02:04:38.660 --> 02:04:41.420]   Welcome to our Twit Special Coverage
[02:04:41.420 --> 02:04:44.900]   with Google I/O announcement, where we expect to hear no product
[02:04:44.900 --> 02:04:46.420]   announcement, at least that's what's been
[02:04:46.420 --> 02:04:47.740]   your franchise said.
[02:04:47.740 --> 02:04:52.700]   Let me extend our warmest welcome to the over 40,000
[02:04:52.700 --> 02:04:58.620]   who've joined us in 440 viewing parties across 90 countries
[02:04:58.620 --> 02:05:00.980]   worldwide triagulation.
[02:05:00.980 --> 02:05:02.620]   He bought two pizzas for 10,000 Bitcoin.
[02:05:02.620 --> 02:05:03.620]   10,000.
[02:05:03.620 --> 02:05:04.140]   10,000.
[02:05:04.140 --> 02:05:05.980]   That's why it's their million dollar pizzas.
[02:05:05.980 --> 02:05:06.740]   They are.
[02:05:06.740 --> 02:05:09.300]   Holy gimoly, gizwiz.
[02:05:09.300 --> 02:05:10.300]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:05:10.300 --> 02:05:12.300]   [SINGING]
[02:05:12.300 --> 02:05:18.300]   Through the garden, that is where I'll be the lactable NSFW.
[02:05:18.300 --> 02:05:20.300]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:05:20.300 --> 02:05:21.300]   Oh my gosh.
[02:05:21.300 --> 02:05:22.300]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:05:22.300 --> 02:05:23.300]   [SINGING]
[02:05:23.300 --> 02:05:24.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:05:24.300 --> 02:05:25.300]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:05:25.300 --> 02:05:26.300]   Twit.
[02:05:26.300 --> 02:05:27.300]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:05:27.300 --> 02:05:30.300]   It's like the screensabers in Silicon Spin had a baby.
[02:05:30.300 --> 02:05:32.300]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:05:32.300 --> 02:05:33.300]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[02:05:33.300 --> 02:05:38.300]   Actually, we had 200,000 viewers during that Google I/O coverage.
[02:05:38.300 --> 02:05:39.300]   Wow.
[02:05:39.300 --> 02:05:41.180]   Is that the largest we've ever had?
[02:05:41.180 --> 02:05:42.620]   Maybe the iPad and that's what was bigger.
[02:05:42.620 --> 02:05:44.540]   Do we crash your servers at the first time?
[02:05:44.540 --> 02:05:44.980]   That's right.
[02:05:44.980 --> 02:05:47.060]   We could have had more, but the iPad crashed our servers.
[02:05:47.060 --> 02:05:49.140]   We fixed the servers.
[02:05:49.140 --> 02:05:49.660]   Yeah.
[02:05:49.660 --> 02:05:52.660]   200,000 simultaneous.
[02:05:52.660 --> 02:05:56.300]   And that's our conservative count.
[02:05:56.300 --> 02:05:57.180]   So that's pretty good.
[02:05:57.180 --> 02:05:57.740]   Amazing.
[02:05:57.740 --> 02:05:58.300]   Yeah.
[02:05:58.300 --> 02:05:59.220]   You're amazing, Leo.
[02:05:59.220 --> 02:05:59.860]   Congrats.
[02:05:59.860 --> 02:06:01.900]   I take no credit for it whatsoever.
[02:06:01.900 --> 02:06:04.980]   It's all about the fabulous people we get on the show like you guys.
[02:06:04.980 --> 02:06:06.260]   Thank you so much.
[02:06:06.260 --> 02:06:09.100]   Gome have a nice night.
[02:06:09.100 --> 02:06:09.600]   All right.
[02:06:09.600 --> 02:06:10.380]   A nice show.
[02:06:10.380 --> 02:06:10.860]   Thanks.
[02:06:10.860 --> 02:06:11.460]   Thanks, Tom.
[02:06:11.460 --> 02:06:12.300]   Thanks.
