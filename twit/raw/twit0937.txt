[00:03:53.140 --> 00:03:58.880]   Expert we've talked before about the financialization of big tech. I think we'll be talking about that again
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:02.720]   This week great to have you Alex and Alex has brought along his
[00:04:02.720 --> 00:04:06.240]   co-host on the big technology podcast Ron John Roy
[00:04:06.240 --> 00:04:08.000]   he
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.720]   You come from the dark side a
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:19.800]   trader by trade the dark side the dark side a financial I can't I saw the light technology yeah
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:25.920]   So what what were you did you trade for yourself or for a company?
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:35.720]   For one of the larger banks all through the 2000s in the heyday of trading Wow and that little global financial crisis kind of
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.880]   Was the impetus to try to figure out what I really wanted to do and take the fun out of it, huh?
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:47.680]   Well, it's great to have you both we have a lot of stories that you will have something to say about
[00:04:47.680 --> 00:04:50.920]   No doubt. I suppose though. We should begin
[00:04:50.920 --> 00:04:54.240]   Because the time is running out on Twitter
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:58.760]   Not the company just the logo just the name just the bird
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:04.520]   Elon got up in the middle of the night last night and started tweeting
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:07.200]   Always a bad idea
[00:05:07.200 --> 00:05:12.560]   He wants to get rid of the bluebird and replace it with an X
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:20.920]   He he said interim logo goes live later today, which is why I want to do this story now in fact for all I know it's
[00:05:20.920 --> 00:05:26.320]   Already live remember the company that owns Twitter the parent company is called X
[00:05:26.320 --> 00:05:32.320]   In fact, I don't think there is a company called Twitter anymore. I think he renamed Twitter to X Corp
[00:05:33.760 --> 00:05:36.120]   and it sounded as if
[00:05:36.120 --> 00:05:44.440]   The richest man in the world just asked Twitter users to come up with a logo for him because he can't afford it I
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:50.240]   Don't know they also want to change the color scheme from blue to black
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:56.280]   And now I go with just check and see this may be another one of those Elon Musk's I know how to get press
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:05:59.280]   Moments yeah, it's still a bluebird
[00:06:01.400 --> 00:06:03.400]   You know there's a name for this bird
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:11.120]   Did you know that bird's not a no idea I didn't know it either, but it was a jeopardy question, so I figured it's got to be true
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:18.000]   And I've forgotten now. What is the name of the Twitter bird? It was like Jack Bird's name is Joey X
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:24.880]   Well, sir Larry Joey the bird no Larry Larry the bird Larry the bird Larry as in Larry
[00:06:24.880 --> 00:06:28.540]   Oh, I see where this is go. Celtics great
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:34.720]   Biz stone tweeted the name was chosen to honor Larry Bird of the Boston Celtics
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:37.880]   But I'd never heard that before
[00:06:37.880 --> 00:06:46.040]   But I did get the answer right in my mind because I they you know they said a social media site with a bird is a logo named Larry
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:55.840]   So no more Larry and apparently no more bird except it hasn't happened yet
[00:06:56.840 --> 00:06:58.840]   um
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:05.760]   What do you guys have an opinion on Elon cuz you know, we're all wondering what the hell
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:12.120]   We do have an opinion on Elon what's your opinion on Alex? Well, I'll start
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:18.600]   I mean obviously the guy is a very talented entrepreneur. I think you can't really take away what he's built at
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:24.000]   Tesla and at SpaceX and this idea of like the boring company is kind of cool
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:27.440]   And who knows maybe his X AI company will turn into something
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:31.560]   I mean he is also the founder of open AI or co-founder of open AI and
[00:07:31.560 --> 00:07:38.880]   PayPal so yeah, but he pulled out open AI when they said we're gonna make a profit and now he's doing he knows another way
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:44.080]   He got in the press last week. He announced he's gonna do what an AI that's not gonna eat the world
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:50.800]   So yeah, we'll see we'll see what it turns into but he he looks when you make announcements like this
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:57.280]   I'm looking into what are the resources behind it and who do you hire and he's bought a bunch of GPUs from Nvidia
[00:07:57.280 --> 00:08:00.920]   And he's hired people from DeepMind and the University of Toronto
[00:08:00.920 --> 00:08:04.760]   But you know how he's hired them by offering them inflated kind of stock
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:10.800]   trick them into thinking but these people are smart like you know, they they are they are worth a lot of money
[00:08:10.800 --> 00:08:16.000]   They know that and listen anyone who spent time talking with folks working in Silicon Valley
[00:08:16.400 --> 00:08:22.640]   Knows that they are extremely aware of the way that they get paid and it's very difficult to pull the wool over their eyes
[00:08:22.640 --> 00:08:25.760]   So I think that they probably understood what they were getting into with you on
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:32.320]   He valued is because I think he's gonna call it truth G at 20 billion dollars
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:35.960]   And then goes to the biggest names in AI
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:41.440]   You know the the the real thinkers the doers the coders and says I know I'll give you 1%
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:48.240]   Which is worth 200 million dollars if you come on over and they should really make it
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:52.720]   Please how many employees get 1% of a company right as at the start?
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:08:54.880]   So look is it gonna work out?
[00:08:54.880 --> 00:09:00.760]   No, but but a lot of like people in Silicon Valley say this is a worthwhile shot to take I get 1% of a company
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:03.880]   Yeah, Elon Musk is founding. That's why people are taking the shot
[00:09:03.880 --> 00:09:09.640]   I don't think that they like they know they can't cash out that stock and say from the day one that they're gonna be able to make that money
[00:09:09.640 --> 00:09:14.680]   But you know 1% of a company is definitely nothing is sneezing most people like you know
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:18.280]   You start you got a couple of basis points and you're thrilled 1% isn't bad
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:22.000]   But I think let's take it back to Larry Bird
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:26.200]   the fact that Twitter calm is still blue and
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:33.400]   Full of birds. I think Alex and I always get into this on our weekly segments about Elon
[00:09:33.400 --> 00:09:38.640]   He spoke he made a major claim whether he follows through on it
[00:09:38.640 --> 00:09:45.120]   I think this is the thing that in the medium to long term Elon is very interesting in the day-to-day in the short term
[00:09:45.120 --> 00:09:52.520]   I think it's best to try to ignore him. It's very tough to do that, but I still wonder for me Linda yacareno
[00:09:52.520 --> 00:09:59.800]   What is she thinking? How is she gonna approach this because I mean from the business side trying to convince
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:06.040]   Advertisers especially with the rise of threads that we are a stable place come here come do business and
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:13.920]   This is happening. I cannot imagine how tough those calls are she she had a very interesting tweet about this x thing
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:19.720]   Where she talks a little bit about what the strategy of Twitter is gonna be so X if you think about it is
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:25.000]   Sort of this cross-section and that's what she talks about X is the future state of unlimited
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.200]   Interactivity now listen. There's a lot of cringe going on in this tweet
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:33.520]   Let's just pay attention to the details for a second. She says it's gonna be centered in audio video messaging
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:35.760]   payments and banking
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:41.760]   Creating a global marketplace for ideas goods and services and opportunities powered by AI X will connect us all
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:46.100]   All in ways. We're just beginning to imagine and she talked about how people
[00:10:46.100 --> 00:10:48.760]   criticizing Twitter
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:52.920]   a powerpoint deck straight out of succession like
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:59.640]   Saying it's gonna work, but I'm saying we got a glimpse they want to do mark
[00:10:59.640 --> 00:11:03.200]   They want to create a marketplace. They want to do payments. There might be goods in there
[00:11:03.600 --> 00:11:10.080]   That's where they're going with this X is the future state of unlimited interactivity. Okay. I have not seen that
[00:11:10.080 --> 00:11:13.680]   I see that that was about until you hit the right limit until we
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:23.080]   Luckily, I must have hit the rate limit at that point, but man poor of Linda just selling selling an ad just delivering a stable ad product
[00:11:23.080 --> 00:11:29.720]   I think is the most important test right now versus trying to build the super app of the future and we've talked about this again
[00:11:30.240 --> 00:11:35.520]   Perhaps that is an opportunity perhaps Elon is the one that can deliver it, but I don't know
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:40.760]   I still this kind of day-to-day operation, especially when your business is
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:46.880]   Advertising I cannot see how this is gonna come out on the other side. Okay. Yeah, I'm with you after everything
[00:11:46.880 --> 00:11:51.080]   I said about you line the caveat is that what he's done with Twitter has been detrimental to him
[00:11:51.080 --> 00:11:57.880]   I mean objectively bad for him and all his businesses would be including his new AI company would be better off if he
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:12:00.040]   sold Twitter and that's what I think he should do I
[00:12:00.040 --> 00:12:06.760]   Think what may happen is it goes bankrupt and the and the 13 billion dollar worth of bank
[00:12:06.760 --> 00:12:08.440]   equity
[00:12:08.440 --> 00:12:10.440]   gets taken back and
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:15.560]   The banks own it and I think maybe that's even what Elon would like because at this point
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:20.320]   I feel like well who knows what Elon wants. So he wants just nuts. I don't know what he's looking for I
[00:12:20.320 --> 00:12:25.480]   Know I want JP Morgan to be the bastion
[00:12:25.480 --> 00:12:28.920]   Yeah, they're not gonna do a good job with it. I'm square
[00:12:28.920 --> 00:12:32.160]   That's what I've always dreamed it's always struck me
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:35.520]   I almost hate doing Elon stories because I feel I feel played when I do an Elon story
[00:12:35.520 --> 00:12:41.280]   It always strikes me that he woke at midnight and thought well, hey, I haven't been I haven't been the press has been writing
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:46.600]   About me in about 48 hours. What can I say that will get me a lot of coverage and that's oh?
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:54.000]   I will rename it X and give us your thoughts for our new logo and Bing bada-bung. We're talking about it
[00:12:54.720 --> 00:12:59.840]   He seems like a manipulator of the media more than anything else to me
[00:12:59.840 --> 00:13:01.560]   But he is a newsworthy person though
[00:13:01.560 --> 00:13:03.800]   I mean he definitely is a medium manipulator
[00:13:03.800 --> 00:13:08.720]   But he is he does own Twitter, which is a very important social network. Maybe the second most
[00:13:08.720 --> 00:13:15.920]   important and then like he does I mean SpaceX and Tesla like he did he commands the coverage I
[00:13:15.920 --> 00:13:21.640]   Could be better at covering him, but I certainly newsworthy. I snuck a spy into the
[00:13:22.760 --> 00:13:26.240]   Accession filming and got this PowerPoint slide
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:31.880]   From the hundred which was if you remember at the beginning of the season the company the kids were gonna start
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:38.280]   Here is how big can it get is the slide initial audience a hundred eighty million English language ready
[00:13:38.280 --> 00:13:43.040]   customer base across the world hungry for stimulating news and info
[00:13:43.040 --> 00:13:47.840]   Multilingual multifaceted growth opportunities follow the growth contagion
[00:13:47.840 --> 00:13:51.720]   financial model applicable the hundred franchises of
[00:13:51.920 --> 00:13:57.800]   the hundred thousands of permutations of the hundred available and scalable audio events and dating services
[00:13:57.800 --> 00:14:03.680]   This seems like you not just took this slide or at least Linda yackarino took this slide
[00:14:03.680 --> 00:14:10.080]   For their own. I mean this is this what I loved about this is a satire. This is
[00:14:10.080 --> 00:14:16.320]   armstrong Jesse Armstrong satire of the nuttiness of tech decks
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:22.360]   But it's real. I mean, that's exactly what X is right. It's BS
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:28.720]   Let's not forget a Kendall's description as it would be sub stack meets masterclass
[00:14:28.720 --> 00:14:32.200]   New York. I'm glad to know you watch the show
[00:14:32.200 --> 00:14:36.480]   I just haven't been able to it was a great line
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:44.120]   I've been able to get this thought out of my mind that Jamie diamond is eventually gonna be making content moderation decisions
[00:14:44.720 --> 00:14:51.280]   I'm believable and he's gonna he's gonna let us edit tweets even if you don't have a eight dollar subscription
[00:14:51.280 --> 00:14:56.360]   That's Jamie diamond for stuff. What was it again sub stack meets masterclass?
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:14:59.840]   Me the economist meets the New Yorker
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:06.200]   That's a description of this show actually I think that's exactly what we're doing
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.360]   here
[00:15:08.360 --> 00:15:11.040]   He did Elon did get some big names
[00:15:11.960 --> 00:15:16.160]   researchers from Google deep mind University of Toronto to join
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:20.840]   X AI, which is the current name of it
[00:15:20.840 --> 00:15:25.600]   He I
[00:15:25.600 --> 00:15:29.240]   Just want to write it all off to be honest with you and just say it's
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:32.360]   It's it's Elon's weird
[00:15:32.360 --> 00:15:35.240]   Bizarro world
[00:15:35.240 --> 00:15:39.160]   Meanwhile threads use down to six minutes a day
[00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:44.400]   Elon was very nervous about Mark Zuckerberg's Twitter clone
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:52.880]   Not doing that well according I think Ron John you posted this article from business insider
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:16:00.400]   Yeah, Alex and I talked about this last week on our podcast I think that
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:08.920]   Coming out as strong as they did and making such a big deal about making it to a hundred million users was actually a big mistake
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:14.080]   I think they even though they claim that they did no quote unquote promotion
[00:16:14.080 --> 00:16:18.600]   Mark Zuckerberg had it threaded or posted to threads or whatever we will call it
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:25.080]   I think they clearly you know leveraged whatever they had at their disposal if you have you downloaded the app
[00:16:25.080 --> 00:16:29.200]   I am on it. Yeah, so it basically your Instagram
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:32.080]   It you know pulls over all of your contacts
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:37.320]   It allows you to instantly follow everyone you don't even have to enter information to create an account
[00:16:37.320 --> 00:16:43.560]   So they clearly made it as frictionless as possible and leverage their billion strong Instagram user base
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:52.560]   But now it's got to be interesting and normally I mean I really was thinking back what communities have succeeded again YouTube
[00:16:52.560 --> 00:17:00.680]   Succeeds it starts with creators homegrown creators people who really make their way up on the platform even Twitter if you think about it
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:04.920]   It developed so well and so strongly because it developed its own voice
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:07.600]   It developed its own community
[00:17:07.600 --> 00:17:16.000]   You know getting to a hundred million users who are not sure what to expect having Paris Hilton tweeting a Taco Bell and Netflix and
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:23.360]   Spotify and everyone else trying to be funny. I feel does not make for a sticky community driven platform. So I
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:30.720]   Don't know they got the brands to move right over there as fast as possible even quite a few celebrity
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:33.280]   names that's that's kind of in
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:42.800]   Latter-day Twitter was the thing that people said they stayed on Twitter for the news the news brands the consumer brands
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:46.320]   And the celebrities I
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:51.480]   Don't know yeah, and I and I think it's an existential business threat
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:56.840]   Twitter whether or not people stick around but again they are and
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:18:03.600]   Alex wrote about this. I mean what how early advertisers gonna get on there whether it's Q4 of this year
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:10.400]   I mean, I think they are going to get every advertiser over there who's gonna run away from X
[00:18:10.400 --> 00:18:13.000]   dot com slash Twitter and
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.040]   And they want a safe place to go and they want a place they can trust and
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:18.480]   meta
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:26.280]   Owns advertisers and it's another place to go and they're gonna get every one of those ad budgets away from whatever is left at Twitter
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:27.920]   Yeah, and it's more than a safe place
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:36.280]   It's meta's ad platform, which is just able to target people and optimize in a way that's far better than any other social platform
[00:18:36.280 --> 00:18:41.400]   Could dream of and Twitter certainly has never held a candle to so I think when you talk to advertisers
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:45.640]   They're not saying well, I want you know a place where like I have a more politically correct
[00:18:45.640 --> 00:18:52.560]   Environment but my audio my message in front of people they just said we want platforms that can make our customers money and
[00:18:52.760 --> 00:19:00.160]   The meta ad platform is so good that that's where we spend our time on meta and on Google and everything else is an afterthought
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:03.840]   And it's just kind of more of that in terms of the monetization potential of threads
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:05.440]   But yeah, I mean it's like
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:12.840]   Ron John's totally right here that the the overhyping of the user numbers in the beginning was a terrible mistake and just my
[00:19:12.840 --> 00:19:16.840]   Experience I've been using threads a lot in my experience there has been that the
[00:19:17.640 --> 00:19:23.280]   The usage is is just an engagement is way way down and growth has tailed off completely
[00:19:23.280 --> 00:19:27.720]   Which leads me to believe that you know, they hit that a hundred million user number pretty quickly
[00:19:27.720 --> 00:19:34.040]   But they their curve must have just flattened are people going back to Twitter. Is that what you think's happening?
[00:19:34.040 --> 00:19:40.000]   Maybe people are just giving up on this format altogether. That's what I'm wondering it's a lot less
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.960]   I mean, that's what's happened to me. Maybe it's the end of social, you know
[00:19:43.600 --> 00:19:50.280]   Exactly. Well, it's like definitely like you you used to so the utility of these platforms was to know what happens in the moment
[00:19:50.280 --> 00:19:57.280]   Right and Twitter has because of Elon's algorithmic ranking changes and the end of verification of people that were making news
[00:19:57.280 --> 00:19:58.920]   Has made that
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:01.800]   Pre-sea utility, you know much less vital
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:07.480]   To the platform and then threads doesn't even want news on it. So it's like and you're blue skies too small
[00:20:07.480 --> 00:20:11.720]   So when Tony Bennett passed away god bless him RIP
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:13.720]   I
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:16.640]   Didn't learn about it on Twitter or on threads
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:22.000]   Used to be that's where you'd find out if or at least go if you heard somebody passed
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:30.640]   That's where you'd go, but I don't I don't think that that's the case anymore. That's just one example obviously the reason yeah the reason that Twitter has
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:36.520]   Been so has struggled to grow past 200 million users or 300 million users
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:43.000]   If you go monthly is because most of the population is totally okay getting their news on new sites and
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:49.280]   They don't need to know it that second they can know it five minutes later when it's on like NY times calm or the Wall Street Journal and
[00:20:49.280 --> 00:20:52.280]   You know while while these platforms to grades
[00:20:52.280 --> 00:20:56.660]   This is a sort of the point I was building up to when these platforms to grade the
[00:20:56.660 --> 00:21:00.520]   200 million or 300 million of us on Twitter and a digit switter
[00:21:00.800 --> 00:21:05.960]   We are we are forced to go back to home pages again and many people are gonna be like well
[00:21:05.960 --> 00:21:12.960]   That's not too bad. You may be I'll do that instead of yeah on this app that makes me angry and is filled with outrage and you know
[00:21:12.960 --> 00:21:16.600]   Just you know disgusting stuff and chat GPT influencers. I hope you're right
[00:21:16.600 --> 00:21:21.080]   Because that would be I think the most healthy thing
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:23.840]   wouldn't it for
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:26.840]   The internet is
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:33.200]   I feel like yeah, am I wrong? I think that's a good point because even for me that question there
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:39.800]   There's definitely been a transition period where I'm looking for someone to tell me what's happening right now
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:46.280]   About everything and then after a few days you start to realize maybe you don't need to know
[00:21:46.280 --> 00:21:49.560]   What's happening right now about everything at that moment?
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:54.860]   Yeah, I mean I've started opening the New York Times app more like starting
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:03.520]   Going to a new zap Wow going to a news app. It's like 2011 all over again. This is the future
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:07.600]   Yeah, I mean it is and also
[00:22:07.600 --> 00:22:13.480]   Being more topical and specific of only looking for things that I want to know about
[00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:20.440]   Actually tech meme and going to their actual site sites like that. I think curators of news that you trust
[00:22:20.440 --> 00:22:24.440]   I think all of these are gonna become much much more valuable than
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:30.800]   We were all spoiled because again if you had built your Twitter feed in a way in a smart way
[00:22:30.800 --> 00:22:37.440]   That really was the perfect way to tell you exactly what was happening, but that's it's just not the case anymore
[00:22:37.440 --> 00:22:41.600]   It's funny because I've been going to tech meme for probably a decade and a half
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:47.920]   As my as almost my home page on the internet, but I am doing tech news. So that's the first place I go
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:55.040]   But that's interesting because that is a very old-school style of site where they're aggregating stories from other
[00:22:55.720 --> 00:22:57.040]   news sites
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:22:59.880]   And and they used to do it GABY's to do it
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:05.040]   Automatically now has editors and they do it manually. It's it is a very old-school
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:07.240]   aggregator
[00:23:07.240 --> 00:23:14.240]   Yeah, but then even what I love that they do even add a bit of context and he headline to try to add their own yeah perspective
[00:23:14.240 --> 00:23:16.160]   yeah, rate
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:17.120]   tweets
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:23.760]   Skeets threads whatever else they built into the CMS right now, but I think again
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:29.040]   It's it's it does a good job for a community of telling you what's going on
[00:23:29.040 --> 00:23:31.520]   Obviously how you do that across different?
[00:23:31.520 --> 00:23:38.920]   Interest areas and communities is definitely not solved right now and maybe maybe doesn't get solved in the way it was before
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:42.840]   That's what's old is new again. Maybe that's the answers going back to the
[00:23:42.840 --> 00:23:49.960]   All what's what's next Google Reader comes back. I don't know if I believe it's gonna be yeah
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:52.640]   It'll be sub stacks and podcasts. That's the bet here. Yeah
[00:23:53.480 --> 00:23:55.920]   I mean big technology names
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:24:01.920]   I knew that this would be a story for you guys for sure
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:04.760]   Given your interest in finance and so forth
[00:24:04.760 --> 00:24:13.840]   For the longest time in the US if we want to send payments to friends we'd use Venmo or PayPal or cat the cash app
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:18.280]   It turns out and I did not know this in the rest of the world
[00:24:18.600 --> 00:24:23.800]   Their governments provided clearing houses that were free and widely available and instantaneous
[00:24:23.800 --> 00:24:30.920]   We just never had one in the US the Federal Reserve Bank has now launched it. It's called Fed now an
[00:24:30.920 --> 00:24:34.640]   Instant payment service that costs nothing
[00:24:34.640 --> 00:24:43.360]   Now of course it's got to attach to your bank and your bank may end up charging you even though it costs nothing for the Fed to do it
[00:24:43.360 --> 00:24:48.280]   They're launching with 41 banks 15 service providers including JP Morgan Chase
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:56.800]   Bank of New York Mellon bank Corp. They plan to add more banks and credit unions as the year goes by
[00:24:56.800 --> 00:25:04.480]   It you know the Fed has always run a clearing house. That's taken days. You write it. Remember writing checks
[00:25:04.480 --> 00:25:12.480]   You'd write a check you put it in the mail put it five cents stamp on it and you put it in the mailbox
[00:25:12.480 --> 00:25:14.480]   They don't have any of that anymore by the way
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:21.200]   And then it would arrive and the dentist's office would take it and they would cash it and the and the bank they cashed that
[00:25:21.200 --> 00:25:24.720]   Would send it to the federal clearing house, which you know, I think somebody
[00:25:24.720 --> 00:25:32.320]   With sleeve garters and a green visor would look at it and then stamp it and then three or four days later
[00:25:32.320 --> 00:25:37.240]   That money would be transferred over from your account to the dentist. It would clear
[00:25:37.240 --> 00:25:44.080]   That's how we did it until recently and I think the Fed is finally caught up with the 21st century
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:50.880]   and the rest of the world thoughts on Fed now you covered the bank the SVB bank run
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:59.720]   One one consideration. I know Ron. So was that this would really supercharge a bank run in the future making a lot easier
[00:25:59.720 --> 00:26:06.800]   No, but I still I think this is a huge story because I think this is a perfect example of
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:11.140]   Something a friction that has existed in industry over the last
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:18.640]   15 20 years that anyone who has traveled anyone who has friends who live abroad especially in Europe or in Asia
[00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:24.360]   Who can send money to each other instantly? They don't think about what's the fee gonna be?
[00:26:24.360 --> 00:26:31.000]   Is it a wire transfer? What app do I have to use all this stuff just works and it should work here
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:33.860]   It should money should move back and forth very quickly
[00:26:33.860 --> 00:26:38.600]   And I think it's a good room. It's a good reminder that sometimes, you know, like a
[00:26:39.640 --> 00:26:41.640]   federal centralized
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:46.800]   Program like this that would be most efficient actually is the right solution
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:50.880]   And I think obviously the cryptocurrency dream that was sold for a long time around
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:53.240]   instant payments and
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:59.400]   You know ability to send money. Why can't you would send money on a Saturday or when the bank is closed?
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:02.520]   I think it's finally time that that becomes reality
[00:27:02.520 --> 00:27:06.520]   We catch isn't this isn't this proof that crypto won and
[00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:10.960]   Like this is like a defensive move from the Fed to say, okay
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:17.240]   This is our weakness that could have let the Bitcoiners sort of take over and it what's happened now is that you know
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:22.320]   The mainstream way of paying is actually gonna resemble a little bit more like what the crypto dream looked like well
[00:27:22.320 --> 00:27:24.320]   It was the dream, but remember
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:33.840]   Crypto transfers sometimes took a very long time to clear right even though it was fully digital because the way Bitcoin worked
[00:27:34.800 --> 00:27:38.380]   It could sometimes take days for a Bitcoin transaction to clear
[00:27:38.380 --> 00:27:42.440]   That's such this is the true victory that they've pushed the federal reserve to be their dream
[00:27:42.440 --> 00:27:49.880]   Exactly what the entire industry wanted and Toshi Nakimoto when you sat down to write that paper thought about this
[00:27:49.880 --> 00:27:55.600]   Instant Fed Venmo thing and said if we could get that to happen. Wow, I could die happy Wow
[00:27:55.600 --> 00:28:03.440]   Check your bank to see if you can get fed now and also check to see what they may add on as additional fees
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:10.340]   Is widely expected banks will somehow manage to make some money out of this even though the Fed does not charge for it
[00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:13.840]   Yeah, but it's it's also a good reminder again
[00:28:13.840 --> 00:28:18.960]   I think public private partnerships and the potential for them and where they can work well
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:25.760]   And this is always with payments having one centralized source that was connected to every individual bank
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:31.360]   That could basically as you said and as Alex had a live the crypto dream and be that ledger
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:36.960]   It does not need to be decentralized exactly centralized and it can match payments instantly
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:41.200]   I think and then I mean banks can profit off of this and that's okay
[00:28:41.200 --> 00:28:46.280]   I think you know, it's how much they charge and that level of competition
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:52.520]   Obviously, you'll just kind of continue within the banking industry, but having that underlying infrastructure
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:57.560]   I mean anyone again coming from a trading background, especially I worked in emerging market trading
[00:28:57.680 --> 00:29:06.880]   So seeing how kind of you know an efficient infrastructure could then grow entire economies or just help other things happen
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:11.720]   I think it was a reminder that you know, it's something that's been lacking in the US for a while
[00:29:11.720 --> 00:29:15.240]   I don't know how long ago you were at B of A ron John, but
[00:29:15.240 --> 00:29:19.320]   B of A was one of the companies one of the banks has started zell
[00:29:19.320 --> 00:29:25.680]   Which was the banking industry's response to Venmo PayPal cash app Apple pay
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:28.720]   a
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:32.080]   Lot of people think zell is a problem because it's very easy
[00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:38.000]   You know if if you could trick somebody into zelling you you got their money and the banks aren't gonna stand behind it
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:45.160]   I find it's a problem because if I ever say the words zell out loud in the social situation. I will be a
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:51.720]   What you're using zell could you please Venmo me please?
[00:29:51.720 --> 00:29:54.960]   You're out of the room. Yeah, yeah
[00:29:55.240 --> 00:30:01.440]   But yeah, but but that was also the fraud problems that happened with zell
[00:30:01.440 --> 00:30:06.440]   I think we're a reminder that it's it's this eternal tension between friction
[00:30:06.440 --> 00:30:11.640]   Especially when it comes to financial services, but remember Venmo had a lot of issues
[00:30:11.640 --> 00:30:18.560]   Especially in its early days when it was trying to grow around fraud or illicit use it utility utilization
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:22.320]   So I think it's just it payments always are
[00:30:22.880 --> 00:30:26.320]   reminder that you know, it's a battle of between friction and
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:35.640]   And utilities yeah, he's in utility this hysterical because I I'm with a bank that is not signing up for Fed now so far
[00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:42.680]   They have a bill pay service and most of the time. It's not an a CH the bank prints a check
[00:30:42.680 --> 00:30:46.800]   Which they put in the mail and sent to the payee
[00:30:46.800 --> 00:30:52.240]   Why is it in the United States where we should be on the cutting edge?
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:56.360]   We are so far behind every other country in the world
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:31:02.760]   How does Canada or or France or any of these other countries? How do they handle the fraud issue?
[00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:08.800]   How does the Fed propose to handle a fraud issue banks have said we don't want to be responsible if
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:12.800]   If you if you sell somebody money, that's your problem, dude
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:16.040]   We're not going to give it to you back if it turns out to be fraudulent
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:25.240]   We know one of the problems that's happened with Zell again is if you accidentally send to the wrong person
[00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:31.320]   You send too much money, but I think these kind of things these are just like UX challenges, right?
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:36.080]   These are however these things are built when Venmo started there was no two-factor authentication
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:40.040]   So you know like at a time where you don't even need a secondary
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:42.640]   Input someone could grab your phone and send money
[00:31:42.640 --> 00:31:49.160]   So I think you know every single bank maybe the Fed as part it to be part of the program
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:57.640]   Does put some liability on the banks which would force them to put in some additional checks because remember so far with Zell
[00:31:57.640 --> 00:32:02.080]   Banks have been so desperate to compete against Venmo on volume
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:08.200]   That they would do anything to get you over there and they remove all friction to get you to use Zell in
[00:32:08.320 --> 00:32:15.080]   The hopes that you switch away from Venmo now if they have a better more secure solution that works very well
[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:19.800]   Adding an extra button adding an extra are you sure you want to send it to this person?
[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:23.280]   Can you check the amount these kind of things? I don't think it's no longer
[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:28.160]   Gonna kneecap them versus what was happening where they're trying to compete against Venmo. Yeah
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:32.080]   And so does have an interstitial anytime at least with Chase
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:34.800]   I mean I use it a lot for business and anytime I try to use it
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:41.240]   There's an interstitial there talking through like six different types of scams saying that if someone told you to send money this way
[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:45.600]   And you should probably that's why you know, yeah, that's good friction there
[00:32:45.600 --> 00:32:48.120]   You know, I used to say Zell is fine
[00:32:48.120 --> 00:32:51.240]   It's no worse on the radio show people that because there were as another
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:55.040]   Finance radio host who used to rail against sell
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:33:00.040]   Probably for reasons of his own, but people would say well you shouldn't you shouldn't use Zell
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:04.600]   I said well if you it's no different than Venmo or PayPal or frankly an ATM machine
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:08.800]   If you take money out of an ATM machine because somebody walked up to you and said hey
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:12.760]   I can't get home. Can you give me 20 bucks for gas and you gave them that money?
[00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:17.840]   The banks not liable for that. Why should the bank be liable for that?
[00:33:17.840 --> 00:33:24.480]   So I'm not sure I really understand why people think the bank should be liable for a Zell transaction
[00:33:25.440 --> 00:33:30.600]   But I'm glad that they are at least kind of warning people that don't fall for this and don't fall for that
[00:33:30.600 --> 00:33:33.760]   It's yeah, I think it's a good reminder
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:39.920]   especially large banks in terms of having this stuff built in because again their financial incentives are
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:42.720]   definitely away from
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:49.680]   allowing too much fraud or too many scams happening where people lose trust because they don't want to lose your trust on
[00:33:49.680 --> 00:33:52.360]   Zell and then you don't want to get a mortgage with them
[00:33:52.360 --> 00:33:56.280]   So I think what happened is when credit card companies came along
[00:33:56.280 --> 00:33:59.000]   Everybody was afraid to use them
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.200]   So the credit card companies in order to get you to use credit cards said well
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:06.520]   Don't worry if there's a fraudulent transaction will we'll back it back it up
[00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:10.920]   We'll give you your money back and they had to do that to get people to use plastic
[00:34:10.920 --> 00:34:15.640]   But that's just because they didn't have a choice I mean
[00:34:15.640 --> 00:34:19.640]   Financial institutions don't so we got in other words
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:22.680]   We got a false sense of security thanks to credit cards
[00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:30.520]   That's a lot easier to back up any purchase when you're charging 18% interest. Yeah, they can afford to exactly
[00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:35.120]   All right. Well anyway watch for Fed now coming to a bank near you or not
[00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:36.280]   I bet my bank now
[00:34:36.280 --> 00:34:40.000]   So this is why I'm brought up Zell because I think the banks have already put so much investment
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:44.400]   Into getting a Zell up and running that they don't want to do Fed now
[00:34:45.320 --> 00:34:50.280]   I think they're ready to move past Zell are they I hope so move past I hope you're right
[00:34:50.280 --> 00:34:53.480]   I hope you're right is it the name of Zell like what makes L so
[00:34:53.480 --> 00:35:01.440]   The name it's the name is it I don't know what it is about it, but I think I've set it out loud
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:06.680]   I've heard other people say it out loud and every time and it all and it almost always
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:10.080]   Naturally comes up in a very social situation. You're a dinner
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:13.920]   You're somewhere where you need to send someone money and you're all talking about it
[00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:17.020]   somehow Venmo just rolls off the tongue, but
[00:35:17.020 --> 00:35:19.640]   Zell just
[00:35:19.640 --> 00:35:26.400]   Makes everyone stop for a moment. I just walk by a little funny a Wells a Wells Fargo and their
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:30.400]   Money-send thing. I think is called Fargo, which I think is the best of all the names
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:37.600]   With Fargo Fargo is your like your money assistant for know me man or for you or I'll park you
[00:35:41.080 --> 00:35:46.280]   Alright, let's take a little break. We're doing a takeover big technology takeover

[00:38:55.080 --> 00:39:06.040]   It's been really fun watching the mike drif soft acquisition act go up and down and left and right a 69.7 billion dollar deal
[00:39:06.040 --> 00:39:07.800]   uh
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:12.120]   Only now two people in the way of this acquisition
[00:39:12.120 --> 00:39:15.080]   the uk competition authority
[00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:20.840]   Who's worried about cloud gaming and the f t c and now it looks like the f t c
[00:39:20.840 --> 00:39:23.640]   Uh is stepping back
[00:39:23.640 --> 00:39:29.000]   Uh, it started with a uh injunction the f t c asked the courts to say hey
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:35.320]   We're investigating this acquisition. Can you can you can you issue a temporary restraining order so they cannot
[00:39:35.320 --> 00:39:43.560]   Uh get together the judge took testimony from everybody from satya nadella from sony from everybody and said guys
[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:48.920]   There's no reason for this injunction. I'm not gonna agree to it. I'm not gonna bar it
[00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:55.880]   Microsoft said all right then we're going to the ninth circuit court of appeals who within seconds
[00:39:55.880 --> 00:39:58.680]   Said no no
[00:39:58.680 --> 00:40:01.240]   No, no, we're not gonna stop it either
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:07.080]   Uh, microsoft and activation of extent they had a deadline of july. I think was the 18th
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:11.000]   Uh, that was the that was the trigger for the breakup fee
[00:40:11.640 --> 00:40:15.160]   They agreed no, no, no, this is going to happen, but we're going to extend this to loktober
[00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:17.960]   Uh, it can't be very far off at this point
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:20.520]   Um, except for this little
[00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:22.760]   You know speed bump that we call the united kingdom
[00:40:22.760 --> 00:40:25.080]   Um
[00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:28.200]   You guys have any thoughts on this? I guess the first question I would ask
[00:40:28.200 --> 00:40:31.000]   Uh
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:37.080]   Is it problematic? It's a big merger. You don't see many 69 billion dollar mergers in the world
[00:40:38.200 --> 00:40:43.000]   Clearly two big companies getting together. Is that by itself enough to worry?
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.080]   You talk a lot on what about financialization of tech
[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:51.480]   Let's turn it back on to you. You're a gamer, right?
[00:40:51.480 --> 00:40:55.160]   So the main concern here is that microsoft buys activation
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:59.880]   Then big activation games like call of duty. Only if it can be available on the xbox
[00:40:59.880 --> 00:41:02.600]   Now they've signed some 10-year deals to say okay
[00:41:02.600 --> 00:41:05.240]   It's going to be available on other platforms like the playstation
[00:41:05.880 --> 00:41:08.280]   But isn't that the inevitable end here?
[00:41:08.280 --> 00:41:13.240]   Which is that you get platform exclusivity and that's bad for all gamers because the price goes up
[00:41:13.240 --> 00:41:15.880]   On xbox and you can't use it if you have a playstation
[00:41:15.880 --> 00:41:18.440]   I guess it depends on if you believe microsoft
[00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:21.560]   Because microsoft has said no no no in fact you're right
[00:41:21.560 --> 00:41:27.960]   They've offered a 10-year deal which they offered in 2021 and sony finally signed it after this latest setback
[00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:34.040]   Uh, uh, non-exclusivity they're going to continue to offer it microsoft says why would we not offer it?
[00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:40.760]   On playstation. We want to make money on call of duty and x we lose money on xbox
[00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:43.080]   We're not going to save xbox with exclusives
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:48.440]   Really if you think about it if you're a gamer, you know that sony is far worse on exclusives than microsoft is
[00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:53.560]   Uh far more likely to use exclusives to prop up a the game platform and it's worked for them
[00:41:53.560 --> 00:41:55.960]   I kind of believe microsoft is not gonna
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:41:59.720]   Does not care as much about the xbox business as selling
[00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:04.360]   Software everywhere in fact, that's the new microsoft. There's a new such an indela is we don't
[00:42:05.080 --> 00:42:07.880]   We we want to sell products to everybody on every platform
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:11.320]   So I believe them on that but on the other hand
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:19.800]   I also get nervous when I see giant companies merging because in the long run that seems to me
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:24.920]   Bad for gamers or bad for anybody uses their products
[00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:29.720]   These the bigger the company the more chances they have to monopolize
[00:42:31.320 --> 00:42:37.640]   Yes, I think being I think being nervous is correct because to me the most interesting part of this
[00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:40.360]   FTC lawsuit was
[00:42:40.360 --> 00:42:47.160]   And it was it was one of the first times where they really were betting on and they ended up losing on the idea of not just looking at
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:51.480]   The current state of market power but also where is that market going?
[00:42:51.480 --> 00:42:56.520]   And I know cloud gaming has kind of almost been laughed off because of its size right now
[00:42:56.520 --> 00:42:58.840]   But I think it's instructive if you think about
[00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:06.520]   In 10 years, what's going to be dominant cloud gaming or console gaming if I were to bet I would bet on cloud gaming
[00:43:06.520 --> 00:43:12.520]   If you start if you start to think about how does every cloud service work
[00:43:12.520 --> 00:43:16.600]   Like especially a cloud entertainment service right now look at netflix
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:20.120]   Amazon prime video, how do they all get subscribers?
[00:43:20.120 --> 00:43:27.160]   Exclusives so to me it's almost inevitable that for whatever they say right now about
[00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:33.080]   A 10 year deal and of course we want console gaming and it's better for us to sell the actual
[00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:35.880]   Individual units we all know
[00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:42.760]   Where the market is going and it's going to be cloud gaming and we know how cloud business uh cloud entertainment services work
[00:43:42.760 --> 00:43:49.080]   So to me this is more it's actually a reminder of how hard antitrust enforcement is right now
[00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:57.240]   Because it's never been done before where like you know courts are really ruling on where the market is going and trying to make a
[00:43:57.240 --> 00:44:05.960]   Prediction about that but it's pretty clear that any kind of market power that's going to be accumulated and again who I mean xbox gaming
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:12.520]   Microsoft imagining how they can tie that back in other ways to entertainment to software
[00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:16.200]   You know, it's just another thing that they will definitely own and I think sony
[00:44:16.200 --> 00:44:21.000]   In the long run on that and I think it was a I mean you guys talked about it here last week
[00:44:21.480 --> 00:44:29.000]   sony has been great so far at licensing the ip of its games into movies and other franchises where
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:36.200]   You know, uh, activation has not been yet. That's a definitely another place where leveraging the overall microsoft ecosystem
[00:44:36.200 --> 00:44:38.840]   I think will be very very strong for them
[00:44:38.840 --> 00:44:43.960]   And monopolies are good businesses at the end of the day. Yes, that's why we have to stop one
[00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:49.240]   Right, but i'm saying you asked about what's gonna happen is it good for business or good for the you a consumer
[00:44:49.880 --> 00:44:54.360]   No, it's good for the business that has it right so when you ask about like what do we think about this deal?
[00:44:54.360 --> 00:44:57.000]   That's like sort of like well as microsoft gonna play by the rules
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:03.800]   I don't I mean look if you ask me if you have the opportunity to monopoly you do it right if the government has a louder job
[00:45:03.800 --> 00:45:05.800]   Then you do it. Yeah
[00:45:05.800 --> 00:45:08.440]   I would love to see a banker pitch deck
[00:45:08.440 --> 00:45:16.120]   Versus what they say in an anti-trust lawsuit court on one side in the courtroom. This isn't gonna help our business at all
[00:45:16.120 --> 00:45:18.120]   You know, it's actually not a great deal
[00:45:18.120 --> 00:45:22.280]   What and then obviously i can only imagine it's kind of a microsoft said
[00:45:22.280 --> 00:45:27.320]   Microsoft was a great pain to say this will only make us the number three gaming company
[00:45:27.320 --> 00:45:30.680]   In the world of the only the number three console
[00:45:30.680 --> 00:45:34.680]   a company in the world after after playstation and nintendo
[00:45:34.680 --> 00:45:41.240]   Uh, uh, you know microsoft said we just want to have a position in mobile gaming which they don't
[00:45:41.240 --> 00:45:44.280]   And that's what we get with act division
[00:45:44.280 --> 00:45:47.080]   uh
[00:45:47.080 --> 00:45:50.520]   Hmm part of the problem is that at least in the us
[00:45:50.520 --> 00:45:53.640]   Our anti-trust law is is really out of date
[00:45:53.640 --> 00:45:59.720]   And I think that's one of the things the vfdc under lina con has been trying to do and con and some parts of congress
[00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:03.560]   Have been trying to do is to update our anti-trust law to be more
[00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:08.120]   relevant to modern times and to protect consumers more right?
[00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:11.080]   um
[00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:13.400]   Pretend to me that
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:16.280]   sir, no, don't please
[00:46:16.280 --> 00:46:19.480]   To me this is a reminder that the
[00:46:19.480 --> 00:46:25.480]   Outdated anti-trust certainly is is a huge problem here and and there's been a lot of debate
[00:46:25.480 --> 00:46:31.960]   Should lina con and the ftc taken on these lawsuits, you know, like as she was asked in congress
[00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:34.840]   Are you taking on lawsuits that you think you can win?
[00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:40.040]   To me, I still think these these actions need to be taken because we're at least talking about it right now
[00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:42.040]   What was her answer to that by the way?
[00:46:42.440 --> 00:46:47.960]   That that would they do believe that they will not pursue a lawsuit that they do not think they can win
[00:46:47.960 --> 00:46:51.960]   Okay, that they are but to me actually I mean even if that's what she's saying
[00:46:51.960 --> 00:46:56.680]   I feel like I think there's value in them taking on the biggest players. This is a
[00:46:56.680 --> 00:47:01.880]   $70 billion transaction that has huge implications for the industry
[00:47:01.880 --> 00:47:09.320]   So the versus you know for the past decade the ftc either went you know went after small and mid-sized companies or
[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:12.840]   Took small actions on big tech companies
[00:47:12.840 --> 00:47:17.560]   Meanwhile big tech, you know concentrated power to an unbelievable degree
[00:47:17.560 --> 00:47:19.640]   So so I actually am still
[00:47:19.640 --> 00:47:24.840]   Very much on the side of taking these kind of actions. Obviously there's certainly
[00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:27.320]   endless blowback
[00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:30.280]   for any losses that I think you know like is uh
[00:47:30.280 --> 00:47:34.600]   Is definitely tough to overcome, but I still think it's the right thing to do
[00:47:34.600 --> 00:47:38.040]   ever since ronald reagan
[00:47:38.600 --> 00:47:42.520]   The united states has not has really not enforced anti-trust law
[00:47:42.520 --> 00:47:47.480]   Uh, it was it was reagan era economics that said no no big is good
[00:47:47.480 --> 00:47:51.080]   We don't want to get in the way of big business and ever since
[00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:57.320]   Uh, the ftc has been a revolving door for corporate lawyers and lobbyists
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:48:00.360]   Uh has really not fought
[00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:05.960]   Uh trusts and I think if you talk about big tech you have to talk about it in this context
[00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:11.400]   It's been allowed to become big because we haven't had really effective anti-trust law
[00:48:11.400 --> 00:48:13.960]   Uh since the 80s
[00:48:13.960 --> 00:48:18.040]   That's right. Well, you have the regulator that's underfunded
[00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:22.920]   So anyone who's worked inside the ftc makes clear that they just don't have enough resources
[00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:29.320]   I mean think about this you're going up against microsoft trillion dollar company trying to close a 70 billion dollar acquisition
[00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:31.880]   Your budget is like 300 million dollars a year
[00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:38.200]   For all for everything that you're pretty hard 500 million recently. Yeah, I mean you're you're a company
[00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:42.520]   That's meant to regulate facebook your annual budget is what facebook makes in an afternoon
[00:48:42.520 --> 00:48:47.400]   So and this is what you're talking about with like the reaganism stuff is like after reagan
[00:48:47.400 --> 00:48:52.920]   Yes, and and we went through a year where through an era where we wanted to keep these regulators feeble then
[00:48:52.920 --> 00:48:58.920]   Democrats and republicans all of a sudden came together and they said well, maybe we should team up on big tech anti-trust
[00:48:58.920 --> 00:49:01.480]   They increased the budget a little bit, but not really enough
[00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:08.600]   Um, and they didn't they haven't passed the laws that they've been talking about and bringing all these ceos in front of their committees
[00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:15.400]   Um for their youtube moments, they haven't passed anything. So, you know effectively you still have big tech in the power position
[00:49:15.400 --> 00:49:19.000]   Yeah, and uh really good piece
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:26.120]   Uh, which I did put the link into the show notes uh for mccory doctor who's as you know as you know
[00:49:26.120 --> 00:49:28.760]   uh a very uh
[00:49:28.760 --> 00:49:30.440]   strong
[00:49:30.440 --> 00:49:33.320]   proponent of uh anti-trust regulation
[00:49:33.320 --> 00:49:37.320]   Uh this from the 14th of july why they're smearing
[00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:41.960]   lina con these talking about publications like the wall street journal
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:50.040]   Constantly harm hammering on how many and congress too. Let's face it on how many losses she has for
[00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:54.440]   She's oh for four and and going to court against uh meta
[00:49:54.440 --> 00:49:57.240]   now against microsoft and others
[00:49:57.880 --> 00:50:01.480]   Uh, but cori points out that con has also done a lot
[00:50:01.480 --> 00:50:05.320]   Of good things and is fighting the good fight in a lot of areas
[00:50:05.320 --> 00:50:08.600]   I think everybody listening the show would agree for instance
[00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:13.320]   Click to cancel, which is most recently the ftc's plan to make it
[00:50:13.320 --> 00:50:18.680]   require that it be as easy to cancel a subscription as it is to make the subscription
[00:50:18.680 --> 00:50:22.760]   That's not even
[00:50:22.760 --> 00:50:24.760]   debatable, right
[00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:26.040]   It's like just
[00:50:26.040 --> 00:50:32.200]   Obvious of course not the way it is in most cases and there's and and the war on robo calls
[00:50:32.200 --> 00:50:35.080]   I think we all agree that that war is the good fight
[00:50:35.080 --> 00:50:38.440]   um
[00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:42.440]   It's a it's a good piece. It's a it's strongly worded
[00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:46.840]   Yes, I think I think the word lickspittle is used
[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:52.360]   Uh and so forth, but uh, but that's cori he's really good at this stuff and very convincing
[00:50:53.320 --> 00:50:57.160]   He says microsoft has a long long long history of being a brutal
[00:50:57.160 --> 00:51:04.280]   Abusive monopolist it's a convicted monopolist and it's bad conduct didn't end with the browser wars
[00:51:04.280 --> 00:51:09.160]   You remember how the lockdown turned all our homes into rent free branch offices for employees
[00:51:09.160 --> 00:51:17.160]   Microsoft seized on that moment to offer our bosses keystroke and click level surveillance of our use of our own computers in our own homes
[00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:19.960]   via office 365
[00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:22.520]   That's the viva product that we've talked about on my this weekly
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:27.800]   If you think a company that gave your boss a tool to spy on their employees and rank them by productivity
[00:51:27.800 --> 00:51:32.920]   As a prelude to firing them or cutting their pay is going to treat gamers or game makers
[00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:37.240]   Well, once they've spent the competition out of business, you're a credulous sucker
[00:51:37.240 --> 00:51:40.920]   And you're going to be so disappointed
[00:51:40.920 --> 00:51:46.840]   The inshitification play this is cori's new word which I love is obvious use investor cash
[00:51:46.840 --> 00:51:50.600]   To make things temporarily nice for customers and suppliers
[00:51:51.160 --> 00:51:53.160]   Lock both of them in in this case
[00:51:53.160 --> 00:52:01.320]   It's within subscription based service similar to netflix and then claw that value back into that all that's left is a big pile of poop
[00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:07.800]   Is cori wrong or or do you agree?
[00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:13.560]   I think that he's talking about the smears of lina con using his words
[00:52:13.560 --> 00:52:19.160]   I think that there's a lot of criticism of lina con the one that we don't really hear often enough
[00:52:19.560 --> 00:52:21.560]   And I think this is a fair criticism
[00:52:21.560 --> 00:52:24.920]   Is that operationally the ftc isn't working as well as it could
[00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:29.960]   And because because of that we're starting to see the losses in these lawsuits
[00:52:29.960 --> 00:52:34.920]   Now, you know you the ftc usually doesn't bring lawsuits that it doesn't think it can win
[00:52:34.920 --> 00:52:39.720]   Right, which I think is goes to ryan john's point that they've been going after small and medium companies
[00:52:39.720 --> 00:52:44.120]   Now they're going they're they're bringing these higher risk lawsuits, but they should still be winning them
[00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:49.320]   And I think that operationally, you know that organization could be run in a much better way
[00:52:49.640 --> 00:52:51.800]   To the point where it's starting to bring to bear
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:54.360]   You know all of the uh
[00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:59.560]   All of the acumen of its legal teams and all the capabilities that it has and it seems like
[00:52:59.560 --> 00:53:03.640]   You know just organizationally. It's just not working as well as as it should be
[00:53:03.640 --> 00:53:07.880]   Yeah, but this is also where Alex and I have debated this definitely
[00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:14.920]   And I think cori doctor's piece really digs into just how entrenched a lot of the power structures are that
[00:53:15.320 --> 00:53:20.440]   I mean trying to overcome again. I think it was 31 out of 41 for uh recent ftc officials
[00:53:20.440 --> 00:53:29.320]   Had worked for the companies that they cover but even more so the judge who actually pushed this through their their argumentation was already
[00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:36.360]   Pretty suspect and he had quoted matt stoller on this around the idea that you know the executives essentially said
[00:53:36.360 --> 00:53:43.080]   We will not hold exclusives again, you know, it's in our business interest to not hold exclusives
[00:53:43.400 --> 00:53:45.720]   That everyone's going to always get call of duty
[00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:53.400]   But and then because that the deadline was july 18th that she felt it was unfair to the companies and it was you know
[00:53:53.400 --> 00:53:57.960]   disingenuous of the ftc to try to essentially break that deadline
[00:53:57.960 --> 00:54:03.080]   Rather than having a full investigation into the potential of the merger itself
[00:54:03.080 --> 00:54:04.840]   So I think already
[00:54:04.840 --> 00:54:12.440]   This is such a big merger. It's such a just an notional dollar value that it's worth having a full investigation into it
[00:54:12.680 --> 00:54:19.240]   But just as also as a reminder of you know how entrenched a lot of these power structures are it's the judge's son
[00:54:19.240 --> 00:54:24.120]   Works at microsoft not in the games division so she did not recuse herself
[00:54:24.120 --> 00:54:30.520]   But it's just a reminder of what lina con and the ftc are going up against so where I still keep coming back to
[00:54:30.520 --> 00:54:34.520]   Not judging them on wins but rather than judging them on
[00:54:34.520 --> 00:54:36.920]   Where is the conversation?
[00:54:36.920 --> 00:54:42.520]   How is antitrust move forward and I think again thinking about where we are now versus three or four years ago
[00:54:42.520 --> 00:54:45.480]   No one would have even batted an eyelash on this deal
[00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:51.720]   But you have to judge on wins because there's ideology and then there's league there's the grounding in the legal facts
[00:54:51.720 --> 00:54:55.640]   And you could say that you know, they're in a good place
[00:54:55.640 --> 00:55:01.000]   Ideologically and I think going after this microsoft activation merger is certainly one of those cases
[00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:08.760]   But if your ideology can't match your legal legal grasp of the facts which will give you victories in courts
[00:55:08.760 --> 00:55:13.560]   And ultimately, what are you serving? You're like well, there's a argument lawsuits
[00:55:13.560 --> 00:55:16.600]   But you're not backing up trying to make your ideology
[00:55:16.600 --> 00:55:20.120]   You know the law of the land and that's the criticism on con that I think is legitimate
[00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:24.120]   But there is the argument that at least pursuing these whether you win or lose
[00:55:24.120 --> 00:55:26.520]   You're making companies think twice
[00:55:26.520 --> 00:55:29.880]   And but you have to pursue them in wind though. That's that's what I'm saying
[00:55:29.960 --> 00:55:34.680]   Well, but even going to matches even going to trial can be harmful
[00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:37.320]   I think there was stuff in discovery
[00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:42.120]   During this that both my hurt microsoft as much as it hurt sony
[00:55:42.120 --> 00:55:47.240]   And so even going to trial and discovery can be problematic for these companies
[00:55:47.240 --> 00:55:50.200]   And then there's always the risk that they're going to lose
[00:55:50.200 --> 00:55:52.280]   You don't know what the outcome is going to be
[00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:55.400]   When you enter into this even if you think you have a strong case
[00:55:55.400 --> 00:55:58.440]   And so it may cause companies to think twice before
[00:55:59.000 --> 00:56:02.520]   I mean, that's the only argument you can make I agree that she it'd be great if she would win
[00:56:02.520 --> 00:56:08.200]   But you're but probably part of the problem is not so much these are bad cases
[00:56:08.200 --> 00:56:11.960]   But that the anti trust law there that's the foundation for these cases
[00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:16.120]   Does not fit well to the current circumstance
[00:56:16.120 --> 00:56:20.920]   Is that then here's the thing they know the laws so they should bring cases that well
[00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:27.000]   They've said under the law. I understand and the FTC has said we you know a big part of this is getting new laws
[00:56:27.320 --> 00:56:29.640]   The problem is you're not going to get congress to do anything right?
[00:56:29.640 --> 00:56:33.800]   Exactly. Yeah, well, that's the thing you're not going to get congress to do anything
[00:56:33.800 --> 00:56:35.080]   So what do you do?
[00:56:35.080 --> 00:56:39.720]   Do you continue going after small and medium sized businesses or do you take these swings?
[00:56:39.720 --> 00:56:45.640]   And as they could lose if not every single one of these things goes right for microsoft
[00:56:45.640 --> 00:56:50.680]   If they don't come in guns blazing with all their resources at hand
[00:56:50.680 --> 00:56:55.000]   Maybe they do lose or maybe the next one, you know, the next merger like this
[00:56:55.640 --> 00:57:01.480]   Doesn't go through so I think I still think uh, yeah, you know pushing forward on these kind of things again
[00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:05.400]   Two to three years ago the idea of looking at a future market
[00:57:05.400 --> 00:57:10.600]   From an antitrust perspective did not exist in anywhere in the conversation
[00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:15.160]   This decision makes us at least think about it. Where is that never happened before?
[00:57:15.160 --> 00:57:22.200]   70 billion seems like I can't i'm trying to think of any of larger acquisitions. There haven't been many
[00:57:22.200 --> 00:57:24.600]   That's huge
[00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:30.360]   70 instagrams 70 instagrams think of how many instagrams they could have bought with that money
[00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:35.240]   But only uh what one a 1.6 twitter's
[00:57:35.240 --> 00:57:41.560]   But twitter was a little overpriced wasn't it? Yeah twitter's then or twitter's now
[00:57:41.560 --> 00:57:44.280]   Now
[00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:45.400]   Yeah, I
[00:57:45.400 --> 00:57:49.880]   Is there a google search greater than 70 billion dollar acquisitions? I don't know if there is
[00:57:50.120 --> 00:57:55.000]   I feel it would be like only oil and gas companies. Yeah, I mean it's giant
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:58.360]   If nothing else it shows you how big the game business is
[00:57:58.360 --> 00:58:05.800]   How valuable it is to to microsoft. I mean this is this is more than uh any other entertainment property, right?
[00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:08.040]   Huge
[00:58:08.040 --> 00:58:14.200]   Let's take a little one of the interesting. Go ahead. I'll say is okay. Oh, no go ahead. I'm sorry. I've said conflicting things
[00:58:14.200 --> 00:58:16.600]   Go ahead
[00:58:16.600 --> 00:58:22.520]   I'm gonna go one of the interesting things though is that like you know the economy has really shifted since this agreement was inked
[00:58:22.520 --> 00:58:25.880]   And microsoft is still like yeah, we'll pay the 70 billion
[00:58:25.880 --> 00:58:29.240]   So it's it just goes to show you how big they think this could be it's yeah
[00:58:29.240 --> 00:58:35.080]   Uh, I think Corey's contention is microsoft wants to put sony out of the gaming business
[00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:39.800]   I'm not sure that's right, but uh, you think so you think that's their goal ultimately
[00:58:39.800 --> 00:58:43.320]   Yeah, look there. They this is the thing look at their market cap
[00:58:43.800 --> 00:58:46.920]   Right if you're once you go in the trillion dollar range as a company
[00:58:46.920 --> 00:58:52.200]   You need to squeeze all the growth out of every market that you operate in to justify your valuation
[00:58:52.200 --> 00:58:58.040]   Yeah, so it's not like wants or doesn't want it has to it has to squeeze sony out of the game or else
[00:58:58.040 --> 00:59:01.800]   It's market cap shrinks and then the ceos in hot water. Uh, okay
[00:59:01.800 --> 00:59:04.600]   See this is why we had the finance guys on
[00:59:04.600 --> 00:59:10.040]   This is the this is the this is where you get the money show. We've got uh take over by

[01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:29.000]   More probably right
[01:00:29.000 --> 01:00:31.320]   How about 15 dollars a month all in?
[01:00:31.320 --> 01:00:34.680]   15 dollars
[01:00:34.680 --> 01:00:36.120]   a month
[01:00:36.120 --> 01:00:44.440]   That's it by the way includes unlimited talk unlimited text nationwide plus high speed data delivered on the nation's largest 5g network
[01:00:44.440 --> 01:00:48.120]   You choose the plan that matches how much data you need
[01:00:48.120 --> 01:00:54.600]   They just really do it right premium wireless for as little as 15 dollars a month

[01:02:10.680 --> 01:02:12.040]   Uh
[01:02:12.040 --> 01:02:13.800]   Antitrust is coming at
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:19.240]   Microsoft and other companies though from uh, europe in big time the guns are firing amazon and apple
[01:02:19.240 --> 01:02:21.880]   Have now been fined two hundred eighteen
[01:02:21.880 --> 01:02:24.680]   million dollars by the spanish
[01:02:25.400 --> 01:02:27.000]   antitrust
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:29.000]   watchdog
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:31.720]   That now this is saying that they colluded
[01:02:31.720 --> 01:02:39.160]   I'm not sure I agree with this one, but they colluded to limit the online sale of apple devices in spain
[01:02:39.160 --> 01:02:41.240]   Uh
[01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:43.720]   Apparently when amazon and apple made a deal
[01:02:43.720 --> 01:02:49.080]   For amazon to send sell apple phones from apple on amazon
[01:02:49.080 --> 01:02:51.800]   They agreed
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:56.520]   Not to allow third parties to sell those same phones more than 90
[01:02:56.520 --> 01:02:58.040]   percent
[01:02:58.040 --> 01:03:03.400]   Of the existing retailers who were using amazon's marketplace to sell apple devices were blocked as a result
[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:07.320]   Um apple's
[01:03:07.320 --> 01:03:09.320]   Device cost went
[01:03:09.320 --> 01:03:13.480]   The prices of apple's devices sold online went up as a result
[01:03:13.480 --> 01:03:21.240]   Amazon says we reject the suggestion that amazon benefits from excluding sellers from its marketplace
[01:03:21.720 --> 01:03:29.560]   Our business model yerada our business model hinges precisely on the success of the company selling through amazon
[01:03:29.560 --> 01:03:34.600]   Um, I think alice you might have covered this in always day one
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:37.400]   Uh
[01:03:37.400 --> 01:03:39.400]   Amazon does these deals don't they?
[01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:46.440]   Yeah, this is this is part of the business and I also like don't really think that they care about the fine from spain
[01:03:46.440 --> 01:03:47.720]   I mean
[01:03:47.720 --> 01:03:50.760]   a couple hundred million dollars to them is you know
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:57.800]   Uh, so drop in the bucket ultimately and they can they can put their legal team on it and fight it and come to a settlement
[01:03:57.800 --> 01:04:00.680]   That's half or a quarter of that and continue to move on
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:05.400]   And by the way, I also want to apologize to your to your listeners. I said that mike's off was around
[01:04:05.400 --> 01:04:09.880]   A trillion dollars. It's actually I looked it up in the break 2.5 trillion
[01:04:09.880 --> 01:04:14.200]   So it's amazing you don't have times that so now it definitely needs to squeeze out the market
[01:04:14.200 --> 01:04:16.760]   One of the verification
[01:04:16.760 --> 01:04:20.200]   But I think this also is such a perfect illustration
[01:04:20.200 --> 01:04:25.560]   About what alice was saying around how you have to just squeeze whatever you can because again
[01:04:25.560 --> 01:04:28.120]   Let's think through the actual dynamics of this
[01:04:28.120 --> 01:04:35.240]   Amazon clearly iphones being sold on their platform is a good thing overall globally for the business
[01:04:35.240 --> 01:04:40.600]   Apple willing to go on the business, but doesn't want third parties to sell them. They want to sell them
[01:04:40.600 --> 01:04:43.560]   under the apple name a little deal is done
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:50.760]   And you know globally that's potentially a huge business for both amazon and it's good for apple
[01:04:50.760 --> 01:04:57.000]   But obviously within that limits consumer choice in a country like spain is seems to be going after this
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:03.080]   The fact that they would even make that deal for the spanish market and almost I don't want to say waste their time
[01:05:03.080 --> 01:05:10.360]   But something that small in their larger businesses a reminder that you know the dynamics are set up internally where they are
[01:05:10.920 --> 01:05:16.520]   Trained to squeeze every market for whatever they can and this is also a reminder again
[01:05:16.520 --> 01:05:22.200]   Like these are the things where we're actually seeing results and wins in antitrust
[01:05:22.200 --> 01:05:29.400]   Around the world and we're almost all laughing enough and I am kind of laughing it off again 200 million dollars
[01:05:29.400 --> 01:05:36.840]   It's an ftc budget, but it's a drop in the hat for them. So so I think it this case actually
[01:05:37.400 --> 01:05:43.400]   You know exemplifies a lot about how big tech competitive dynamics work around the world
[01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:48.680]   Just wait until spain finds out how much google's paying apple to be the default search on the iphone
[01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:55.000]   What is that the estimate? I saw last time I saw was 11 billion a year. I think it's gone up from that
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:58.280]   Uh, it's got to be more than yeah, it's a big part of apples
[01:05:58.280 --> 01:06:02.760]   Services is ripping you his money a check from google
[01:06:02.760 --> 01:06:06.200]   Now it's instantaneous thanks to fed now by the way
[01:06:06.680 --> 01:06:12.760]   Uh, yeah apple says that well, we're just trying to keep counterfeits off of the spanish amazon
[01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:18.520]   But really they're just trying to keep third party sellers from selling iphones apple's always done that they want to completely
[01:06:18.520 --> 01:06:22.040]   Control the channel that way they control prices. Yeah
[01:06:22.040 --> 01:06:25.800]   Yeah, it's good for their business and it may be it's good for consumers
[01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:29.480]   You know at least if you're buying an iphone in amazon, it's it's legit right
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:35.080]   They just decided that they want to you know care about counterfeits the moment that apple came in with
[01:06:35.080 --> 01:06:38.200]   exclusive deal for them. Oh, actually we don't need to tell
[01:06:38.200 --> 01:06:45.320]   It's a good deal. It's a profit deal. I get it and get it now
[01:06:45.320 --> 01:06:52.200]   But but think about it again. It's within the EU apple the right to repair. It's a lot more
[01:06:52.200 --> 01:06:58.040]   Aggressive so you should apple has to let you actually repair your device you crack your screen
[01:06:58.040 --> 01:07:01.880]   You don't void your warranty if you go actually get your screen repaired
[01:07:02.040 --> 01:07:07.960]   but to me my favorite and the one i'm most excited about and the uh the realization of good policy
[01:07:07.960 --> 01:07:13.480]   Is if the app the next iphone will have a usb c at least in europe
[01:07:13.480 --> 01:07:17.240]   Because they have to and they have to have single chargers
[01:07:17.240 --> 01:07:24.760]   And I can finally get rid of my lightning cables because that is that the day that happens. I will just uh
[01:07:24.760 --> 01:07:30.200]   You know, let me channel how you meet let me channel apple fanboys though
[01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:34.200]   Uh, because I know because we got a few of them on our show mac break weekly
[01:07:34.200 --> 01:07:35.960]   uh
[01:07:35.960 --> 01:07:37.960]   That is the EU
[01:07:37.960 --> 01:07:41.640]   Dictating technology to a technology company
[01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:43.720]   These guys
[01:07:43.720 --> 01:07:46.520]   Are not technologists. They shouldn't be dictating
[01:07:46.520 --> 01:07:50.840]   What happens when the next thing comes along and everybody's stuck with type c
[01:07:50.840 --> 01:07:54.120]   Because uh the you said you have to use it
[01:07:54.120 --> 01:07:56.680]   Yeah, but
[01:07:56.680 --> 01:08:00.840]   Then don't make my ipad pro usb c keep it lightning. I just want I just want
[01:08:00.840 --> 01:08:09.000]   Fanboy, he's right. He's totally right. I'm an apple fanboy, but just let me carry only one or two cables man
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:15.960]   Completely agree. Yeah, I've been walking around with a broken iphone 10 for about a year waiting for that usb c 15
[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:19.000]   If the iphone 15 comes out and there's no usb c
[01:08:19.000 --> 01:08:22.920]   Go in android this ridiculous at this point pixel time. Yeah
[01:08:23.720 --> 01:08:30.600]   Pixel pro. Yeah, no, I think you're gonna win. I think the I think we're gonna see usb c quickly and and it's the right thing thanks to the EU
[01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:31.800]   Uh, yeah
[01:08:31.800 --> 01:08:37.080]   And also maybe it would have happened anyway because as you pointed out they've already done it with them every other device of theirs
[01:08:37.080 --> 01:08:39.240]   Is type c now?
[01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:43.000]   Uh, now you're gonna have to charge air pods with the same lightning cable just
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:46.680]   You know just do it
[01:08:46.680 --> 01:08:52.200]   Air my air pods wireless charging works the one device where that's true. It actually does the job
[01:08:52.280 --> 01:08:55.400]   It does have wireless my iphone takes like two days, but
[01:08:55.400 --> 01:09:01.880]   No, I'm with you. I'm I agree with you. I'm not one of those apple fanboys who thinks the easiest you use doing the wrong thing
[01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:03.880]   I think we need that
[01:09:03.880 --> 01:09:06.440]   See well speaking of apple
[01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:15.720]   Kind of a victory for apple remember there the apple epic lawsuit which epic lost in almost every regard there was one
[01:09:15.720 --> 01:09:18.600]   thing the court said
[01:09:18.600 --> 01:09:21.000]   is that apple should
[01:09:21.560 --> 01:09:28.840]   Open up to third-party app stores and in particular one of the things apple really didn't like was the requirement
[01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:37.080]   That they undo their anti steering rules. This is a rule that apple imposes on anybody who offers an app
[01:09:37.080 --> 01:09:43.960]   On the iphone on apple platforms. They can't for instance, let's use amazon's kindle app
[01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:49.080]   Now you and I know that you cannot on an iphone buy a book in the kindle app
[01:09:49.720 --> 01:09:55.160]   But the kindle app is not allowed to sit put a link to the amazon web store
[01:09:55.160 --> 01:10:01.000]   Uh where you could buy it because apple doesn't want you to do that they want the 30 percent
[01:10:01.000 --> 01:10:04.520]   Uh amazon's response is well, we're gonna turn off
[01:10:04.520 --> 01:10:10.920]   Buying in the kindle store and people just will have to figure out they buy it on the amazon store and then it appears in their kindle
[01:10:10.920 --> 01:10:17.480]   It's a problem for spotify. It's a problem for anything anybody that has in app purchases 30 goes to apple
[01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:23.240]   Uh on monday apple was granted a motion putting on hold
[01:10:23.240 --> 01:10:26.360]   the appeals court ruling that would
[01:10:26.360 --> 01:10:29.720]   Push its anti steering rules
[01:10:29.720 --> 01:10:34.520]   Out and let outside developers link to a third-party payment mechanism
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:36.760]   the um
[01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:38.760]   the appeals court
[01:10:38.760 --> 01:10:41.640]   Stayed it for 90 days to give apple time
[01:10:41.640 --> 01:10:44.360]   to appeal to the supreme court
[01:10:45.720 --> 01:10:52.520]   district court found that apple had not generally violated anti trust law with its wall garden approach to ios
[01:10:52.520 --> 01:10:58.760]   But did order it to drop rules against letting developers include calls to action for outside payment methods
[01:10:58.760 --> 01:11:05.240]   Uh now they've given them an extra 90 days to petition that with the uh supreme court of course once the petitions filed
[01:11:05.240 --> 01:11:10.520]   It's automatically stayed until the supreme court rules. So apple's gonna have some time it looks like
[01:11:10.520 --> 01:11:15.320]   Uh unless the supreme court immediately says screw it get out of here go away
[01:11:16.040 --> 01:11:18.040]   And uh then they're gonna have to do it
[01:11:18.040 --> 01:11:24.520]   Why is apple fighting this so hard? It's how hard could it be to say all right fine put a link to the kindle store
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:30.920]   They really want i'll go ahead around john they want their 30 percent. That's what they want
[01:11:30.920 --> 01:11:37.880]   It changes everything because I think there was a long period of time where apple was able to sell the idea that
[01:11:37.880 --> 01:11:39.640]   security
[01:11:39.640 --> 01:11:44.200]   You know like a predictability that the app store brought something really specific
[01:11:44.600 --> 01:11:48.040]   But now we're at a point that you know again buying a book on a kindle
[01:11:48.040 --> 01:11:54.600]   Why does it need to be so difficult once you're trained to know to go out and go to the website and buy the book
[01:11:54.600 --> 01:11:57.720]   Then go back to your kindle you start to figure it out
[01:11:57.720 --> 01:12:04.840]   But maybe maybe this one's gonna hit hard because every supreme court justice has a kindle and has not figured out how to buy a book on their uh
[01:12:04.840 --> 01:12:11.240]   On their ipad or iphone so maybe it'll hit but but I think it is just a reminder that
[01:12:11.960 --> 01:12:16.520]   They if they give an inch they're worried about the overall app store tax
[01:12:16.520 --> 01:12:19.560]   And it just goes to show you like they've been so
[01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:25.480]   Admit that the reason why you have to go through apples and app payments is because they're protecting you against counterfeiters
[01:12:25.480 --> 01:12:31.080]   And or or fraud or whatever it is and this whole idea of like letting spotify say
[01:12:31.080 --> 01:12:38.280]   Um, you know you can't subscribe here, but if you want to subscribe go to spotify.com like they have such a problem with that
[01:12:39.000 --> 01:12:42.520]   Like it does go to show you that it really is about the 30 percent that they're gonna make
[01:12:42.520 --> 01:12:47.880]   Yeah, you know credit cards like they're their intermediate areas are there a service. They charge like 3 percent
[01:12:47.880 --> 01:12:53.320]   Um, that's like a normal transaction fee for the transaction fee on the apple sort of be 30 percent
[01:12:53.320 --> 01:12:57.320]   You know that something's wrong and that actually going back to our theme. That is what you know
[01:12:57.320 --> 01:13:04.120]   And he trusts should be addressing and uh and instead we have courts saying yeah go keep keep doing this like i'll let
[01:13:04.120 --> 01:13:08.360]   Was a did you take consumers from figuring out where they can go to actually buy the services?
[01:13:08.360 --> 01:13:12.200]   So do you think the ftc should take on the 30 percent tax?
[01:13:12.200 --> 01:13:18.520]   I think they if they can win by the way, my whole point in this has not been the ftc shouldn't take these things on
[01:13:18.520 --> 01:13:20.760]   It's that the ftc should be
[01:13:20.760 --> 01:13:27.400]   Less grounded in the ideology and more grounded in the legal facts when they come out to these case and just like their track record shows that they haven't been
[01:13:27.400 --> 01:13:29.560]   They should have like a prosecutor
[01:13:30.040 --> 01:13:35.960]   Like a prosecutor does where a prosecutor assesses the likelihood of winning the case before actually pursuing the case
[01:13:35.960 --> 01:13:40.600]   Or deciding deciding what type of case to bring based off of the law, right?
[01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:44.200]   Yeah, but I think the the difference here as a prosecutor
[01:13:44.200 --> 01:13:49.560]   Is not being mindful of how they're shaping the law overall, right?
[01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:55.160]   Prosecutor should prosecuting an individual case is just thinking about that individual case. They're not thinking about
[01:13:55.640 --> 01:14:00.760]   How do I shape the entire economy and and you know rule of law going forward?
[01:14:00.760 --> 01:14:05.880]   Yeah, so I'll concede that that we don't have good enough anti trust law to actually commit and bring this stuff
[01:14:05.880 --> 01:14:10.840]   And you know if congress decided that it wanted to act maybe we could change that but it hasn't decided that so
[01:14:10.840 --> 01:14:15.560]   We're left with this but that being said like I don't think that's a blanket excuse for all these losses
[01:14:15.560 --> 01:14:19.240]   The ninth circuit judge however
[01:14:19.720 --> 01:14:26.840]   Even though they did grant the stay the 90 day stay to apple was not at all happy about apple's arguments
[01:14:26.840 --> 01:14:28.360]   uh
[01:14:28.360 --> 01:14:34.360]   Judge milan d smith writes while the arguments in apple's motion may not be technically frivolous
[01:14:34.360 --> 01:14:44.440]   They ignore key aspects of the panels reasoning and key factual findings by the district court remember apple one everything except this in district court
[01:14:44.440 --> 01:14:47.560]   uh apple appealed to the ninth circuit
[01:14:47.960 --> 01:14:49.960]   ninth circuit also upheld
[01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:52.680]   uh the the ruling
[01:14:52.680 --> 01:14:56.120]   But
[01:14:56.120 --> 01:15:00.360]   Subsequently has granted them 90s days to uh to to appeal
[01:15:00.360 --> 01:15:06.120]   apple ignores the panel key aspects of the panels reasoning and key factual findings by the district court
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:14.200]   When are reasoning and the district court's findings are considered apple's arguments cannot withstand even the slightest scrutiny
[01:15:15.480 --> 01:15:19.400]   apple's standing in scope of the injunction argument simply masquerade
[01:15:19.400 --> 01:15:26.520]   It's disagreement with the district court's findings and objection to state law liability as contentions of legal
[01:15:26.520 --> 01:15:32.040]   Error they kapples arguments cannot withstand even the slightest scrutiny
[01:15:32.040 --> 01:15:35.160]   So he spanked apple even while giving them the 90 days
[01:15:35.160 --> 01:15:39.160]   To appeal it to the supreme court. I guess he felt like he had to give him that
[01:15:39.160 --> 01:15:43.240]   I am so curious if this goes to the supreme court
[01:15:43.880 --> 01:15:49.080]   Who leans in which direction because I feel the fascinating these these cases
[01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:52.680]   You know breakdown any normal
[01:15:52.680 --> 01:15:59.160]   Interpretation of or conventional interpretation of left and right, you know, there's so many nuances
[01:15:59.160 --> 01:16:04.440]   What's in support of business or free markets or I don't know this will be an interesting
[01:16:04.440 --> 01:16:07.240]   I think it's unpredictable, but I do think tim cook should invite
[01:16:07.240 --> 01:16:12.760]   Clarence thomas and justice robs on his yacht and take him for a little ride just you know
[01:16:13.560 --> 01:16:18.520]   Press the flesh greek talk to him. Yeah, let them see his side. You know what i'm saying
[01:16:18.520 --> 01:16:24.360]   Uh, no, I mean that has an already happened. Yeah, I know what can he do does does
[01:16:24.360 --> 01:16:29.480]   Turns thomas is on the phone with apple hq being like hey, so what type of trips can you
[01:16:29.480 --> 01:16:35.000]   Early access to the vision pro. That's it. That's right. They want augments in virtual reality
[01:16:35.000 --> 01:16:40.840]   Justice perhaps you would like a a tour of our vision pro and uh, and it's fine. It's amazing
[01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:44.120]   It's a computer on your face. Give us all the rulings in our favorite police
[01:16:44.120 --> 01:16:49.160]   I don't yeah, I don't know how well the supreme. I don't think you have any indicator of how the supreme court might roll on this
[01:16:49.160 --> 01:16:51.240]   It's just gonna be uh, you know
[01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:55.240]   Catch us catch can we'll see we'll see what happens
[01:16:55.240 --> 01:17:00.920]   Uh, you were excited. Uh, I think uh ronjana about meta and microsoft introducing
[01:17:00.920 --> 01:17:03.800]   llamas into the world
[01:17:03.800 --> 01:17:05.400]   Uh
[01:17:05.400 --> 01:17:07.880]   We talk a lot about artificial intelligence
[01:17:08.840 --> 01:17:13.400]   Uh, we haven't talked a whole lot about this llama is the large language model meta
[01:17:13.400 --> 01:17:19.480]   Has been working on and the next generation is llama too. Of course. You notice microsoft got in there real quick
[01:17:19.480 --> 01:17:23.640]   Uh, microsoft wants to make sure if it's ai that microsoft is there
[01:17:23.640 --> 01:17:26.040]   um
[01:17:26.040 --> 01:17:29.480]   I saw one headline saying
[01:17:29.480 --> 01:17:36.520]   meta opens up llama to everybody except the corporations that might compete directly with this business model
[01:17:38.440 --> 01:17:40.440]   Yeah, I think
[01:17:40.440 --> 01:17:44.360]   This is this is really really interesting because
[01:17:44.360 --> 01:17:48.600]   Having done a good amount of work with generative ai for a while
[01:17:48.600 --> 01:17:50.920]   I've been realizing that again
[01:17:50.920 --> 01:17:56.600]   The largest only working with the largest models or the most expensive models or directly with open ai
[01:17:56.600 --> 01:17:58.600]   You can get
[01:17:58.600 --> 01:18:05.000]   Very very good results for solving very specific problems with much smaller models open source models
[01:18:05.400 --> 01:18:09.560]   So I think it's very smart meta coming in late to the game here
[01:18:09.560 --> 01:18:14.120]   They probably are not going to build some large api driven business like
[01:18:14.120 --> 01:18:17.800]   Open i open ai is doing like google's opening to do
[01:18:17.800 --> 01:18:20.760]   So I think this was the smartest play that they could make and again
[01:18:20.760 --> 01:18:25.400]   We've seen that you know meta has been well ahead from the technology perspective
[01:18:25.400 --> 01:18:30.280]   Beyond lakoon has driven a lot of this research and has been on the big technology podcast
[01:18:30.680 --> 01:18:34.440]   Believe a number of times. I uh, I think this is very interesting
[01:18:34.440 --> 01:18:35.960]   It is funny to me
[01:18:35.960 --> 01:18:41.400]   As you said the fact that microsoft had to get into this press release because all they're doing is saying
[01:18:41.400 --> 01:18:45.240]   It's compatible on the azure eco system. Right?
[01:18:45.240 --> 01:18:47.880]   Yes
[01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:49.880]   Also work on google cloud on
[01:18:49.880 --> 01:18:57.880]   Yes, it's a standard open source model you can go on hugging face and pull a hundred other ones
[01:18:57.960 --> 01:19:04.760]   So like I was very intrigued by the communications element of how that came together
[01:19:04.760 --> 01:19:09.400]   Do you think microsoft gave them some azure credits because generating these models is very expensive
[01:19:09.400 --> 01:19:14.440]   That maybe maybe that's what microsoft did is say well here. We're gonna help you out here
[01:19:14.440 --> 01:19:17.400]   tomato tomatoes research department
[01:19:17.400 --> 01:19:19.400]   Metas got the money. I mean if
[01:19:19.400 --> 01:19:24.120]   This is in some start is scaling startup
[01:19:24.760 --> 01:19:28.440]   What does it mean for microsoft and an open AI right like does it change?
[01:19:28.440 --> 01:19:34.280]   If it microsoft is huge partners with open AI, so I that's sort of what surprised me was to see them
[01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:38.440]   Had uh, you know front and center on the med Microsoft got something for this
[01:19:38.440 --> 01:19:39.800]   I'm I mean
[01:19:39.800 --> 01:19:43.320]   Clearly microsoft wanted to make sure that you understood that this will work on azure right
[01:19:43.320 --> 01:19:44.680]   that
[01:19:44.680 --> 01:19:50.120]   So what what what facebook has done is uh, they have open sourced llama to which is their next
[01:19:50.760 --> 01:19:55.480]   Big large language model and they're making available free of charge for research and commercial use
[01:19:55.480 --> 01:19:58.360]   um, and of course
[01:19:58.360 --> 01:20:05.240]   Versace and Adelek says oh, yeah, by the way, this will run in the azure we actually it's in the azure AI model catalog
[01:20:05.240 --> 01:20:10.760]   Uh, but but then facebook said yep, but it'll also run an aws and hugging face and elsewhere
[01:20:10.760 --> 01:20:17.480]   Well, they didn't mention google cloud. So that's like the dark theory here is that like maybe this is just something that they decided to
[01:20:17.880 --> 01:20:20.760]   The enemy of my kind of mess enemy is my
[01:20:20.760 --> 01:20:24.600]   Okay, is that because like google?
[01:20:24.600 --> 01:20:31.560]   This is like one of the big business lines that google might have is like, you know opens or charging for their their uh, lm's and
[01:20:31.560 --> 01:20:37.400]   Medi comes in and says all right. Well here you could just have is that when you guys do you think that's a legitimate like
[01:20:37.400 --> 01:20:43.960]   Possibility here. Yeah, because if you think google could do it integrated across their ecosystem
[01:20:43.960 --> 01:20:49.640]   They have lllms they have the cloud infrastructure. They have the cons the business consumer side
[01:20:49.640 --> 01:20:52.920]   Of everything so so that's an interesting theory
[01:20:52.920 --> 01:20:58.680]   The restriction is that you can't you have if you have more than seven of any products with more than 700 million users
[01:20:58.680 --> 01:21:04.040]   You have to ask uh meta for permission to use this and it's not so open anymore. So it's like who does that
[01:21:04.040 --> 01:21:07.240]   Who also is included in that?
[01:21:07.240 --> 01:21:09.560]   Ah, let me see it might not be twitter
[01:21:09.560 --> 01:21:12.520]   Maybe definitely not twitter not twitter
[01:21:13.240 --> 01:21:20.280]   But you get to count the bots or not so you guys know all this you've you've interviewed yon lacun. What is what is this thing this
[01:21:20.280 --> 01:21:23.720]   Lama too. What are they giving away?
[01:21:23.720 --> 01:21:27.480]   That they're giving away
[01:21:27.480 --> 01:21:31.400]   Essentially the same infrastructure as a gpt 3.5 or four
[01:21:31.400 --> 01:21:38.680]   Smaller in scope in parameters potentially but still you can fine tune your own models off of them
[01:21:38.680 --> 01:21:45.080]   These are foundation models that allow any company to do all the work of generative AI that we all want to do
[01:21:45.080 --> 01:21:49.560]   It's just free and open and as i was like i'm thinking is this like
[01:21:49.560 --> 01:21:54.760]   Um, so they in other words facebook has done the hard work of creating these models
[01:21:54.760 --> 01:21:59.560]   That's the hard part and now you can play with it to to create your own
[01:21:59.560 --> 01:22:06.440]   Layers on top of it is this processes around it and the thing is all these things
[01:22:06.440 --> 01:22:12.360]   There have been tons and tons of other open source models or free models like this if you go to a hugging face
[01:22:12.360 --> 01:22:15.960]   It's there's a whole community built around this the home of stable diffusion
[01:22:15.960 --> 01:22:21.160]   And if you have a stable diffusion i've been running at my house you can download different models right different
[01:22:21.160 --> 01:22:22.840]   um
[01:22:22.840 --> 01:22:30.120]   Things yeah, it's it but it's it's an entire community of open sourced llms and and for different purposes different models
[01:22:30.120 --> 01:22:36.360]   So so as we're talking i'm starting to think like maybe microsoft also realize and there's a lot of people who have
[01:22:36.360 --> 01:22:42.440]   Said this really is an industry and an ecosystem that can move more towards open source
[01:22:42.440 --> 01:22:50.440]   So maybe microsoft is hedging their bets as well with open AI that you know, that's their bet on closed and this is their bet on open and there
[01:22:50.440 --> 01:22:55.560]   That's a great point. They're making sure their sautia is everywhere at the same time
[01:22:55.560 --> 01:23:00.440]   Well, this was also the week that microsoft announced that they were going to offer
[01:23:01.240 --> 01:23:06.840]   uh chat gpt being chat whatever they call it in uh microsoft 365
[01:23:06.840 --> 01:23:11.000]   And it would only be 30 per seat per per month
[01:23:11.000 --> 01:23:17.800]   Uh, which sounds a little expensive to me, but uh, yeah, there's a definitely commercial side of what microsoft's doing with open AI
[01:23:17.800 --> 01:23:22.520]   Of your google you use google docs you can get all these things for free
[01:23:22.520 --> 01:23:28.360]   So right now google docs has like all the all the same is like what one a Cadillac and one evokes wagon
[01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:33.240]   What's I don't understand no this so that this is where I then competitively gets interesting
[01:23:33.240 --> 01:23:35.640]   Alex and I talked about this last friday
[01:23:35.640 --> 01:23:43.240]   If anyone is a chat gpt plus subscriber, I subscribe to it just to try this new code interpreter tool
[01:23:43.240 --> 01:23:51.000]   It's insane. It's like you can upload massive data sets to it of your own things that would break excel in an instant
[01:23:51.000 --> 01:23:54.920]   And then you just say actually I want to organize the data this way
[01:23:55.320 --> 01:24:01.000]   Can you query what's the average of anything that has like things you would write complex excel functions in the past?
[01:24:01.000 --> 01:24:03.480]   You can literally watch it
[01:24:03.480 --> 01:24:10.520]   Creating python code to actually do that analysis for you things you would have had a data scientist full time for before
[01:24:10.520 --> 01:24:18.680]   So, so I mean I was this is one of the coolest things. I've seen in this whole generative. Is it good code? Is it usable code?
[01:24:18.680 --> 01:24:25.000]   Yeah, it it gets you the right answers and it works and it works on you know instead of there's no hallucination
[01:24:25.080 --> 01:24:30.120]   This isn't standard LLM where it's to you know like working off a giant foundation model
[01:24:30.120 --> 01:24:36.840]   And it's not even sure what it's saying. It's just creating python code that gives you an answer to a data query
[01:24:36.840 --> 01:24:43.000]   But the thing is again right now. It's worth me paying 20 bucks a month to open AI
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:47.000]   Is someone going to come along and do this open source very soon?
[01:24:47.000 --> 01:24:51.880]   I think very likely so so I agree with you that I think a lot of this stuff
[01:24:52.440 --> 01:24:57.560]   Is going to just be the same across and it's going to be awesome for for users and businesses
[01:24:57.560 --> 01:25:02.040]   But how this plays out from a business perspective? I think this is uh,
[01:25:02.040 --> 01:25:07.400]   This is anyone's game, which is maybe why satya is again everywhere
[01:25:07.400 --> 01:25:09.640]   So we've used
[01:25:09.640 --> 01:25:11.640]   I'm trying to understand this we've used
[01:25:11.640 --> 01:25:16.280]   uh thing called whisper AI to do uh transcripts friend of mine uses it to
[01:25:16.760 --> 01:25:22.760]   Transcribe conversations feeds the transcript into chat gpt which generates an action item list
[01:25:22.760 --> 01:25:26.360]   uh based on uh, you know a recorded conversation
[01:25:26.360 --> 01:25:29.320]   Whisper is using models
[01:25:29.320 --> 01:25:31.240]   Uh
[01:25:31.240 --> 01:25:35.960]   Of it can use different models right it could use and it could use in theory. It could use llama right
[01:25:35.960 --> 01:25:39.480]   Is that the idea is that that that's a front end
[01:25:39.480 --> 01:25:46.280]   To do let's say transcription or in your case to do python code and it sits on top of a large language model
[01:25:47.240 --> 01:25:50.840]   Yeah, I mean depending on per we don't know whatever it was built on
[01:25:50.840 --> 01:25:53.480]   I would say like people who got in early on this
[01:25:53.480 --> 01:25:58.680]   Mostly we're using a gpt3 or paying open AI for the api access
[01:25:58.680 --> 01:26:05.560]   But any any service like that can definitely it's I mean as of now, maybe it's not completely but you know
[01:26:05.560 --> 01:26:08.280]   Google has models like text bison
[01:26:08.280 --> 01:26:09.960]   uh
[01:26:09.960 --> 01:26:15.160]   Open AI has gpt 3.5 and 4 facebook is now introduced llama for free
[01:26:15.640 --> 01:26:21.240]   All of those things could theoretically be somewhat interchangeable to do that kind of job, especially
[01:26:21.240 --> 01:26:24.280]   Transcribing creating action items
[01:26:24.280 --> 01:26:29.320]   Summarization like you don't necessarily need them 175
[01:26:29.320 --> 01:26:31.980]   Billion parameter
[01:26:31.980 --> 01:26:37.000]   Gigantic model to do this kind of thing but you still end up paying amazon or microsoft to use it
[01:26:37.000 --> 01:26:42.920]   So it is interesting. It's like well big tech is gonna win you pay them for uh azure minutes or hoes cloud
[01:26:43.080 --> 01:26:46.200]   Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're still paying a lot for compute
[01:26:46.200 --> 01:26:49.640]   Oh, you okay. So there's still a lot of computing going on using it
[01:26:49.640 --> 01:26:54.280]   Yeah, it's just the actual code element of how this all works can be open source
[01:26:54.280 --> 01:27:00.520]   So so yeah, Alex is right big tech wins again. Yeah, you could well. I could run it if I have a powerful machine
[01:27:00.520 --> 01:27:03.160]   You can run locally. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah
[01:27:03.160 --> 01:27:07.880]   Give it a call up and video and get a couple more. Oh, there's another win for me. I need another 40
[01:27:07.880 --> 01:27:11.880]   Five 40 90s how dang it we thought we were out of the woods
[01:27:12.680 --> 01:27:13.480]   Uh
[01:27:13.480 --> 01:27:20.840]   Do so do we know what llamas trained on is it trained on the same data that chat gpt is
[01:27:20.840 --> 01:27:24.840]   Do are they they say anything about that?
[01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:30.360]   I mean, I'm not sure I know the models that they proudly said are smaller
[01:27:30.360 --> 01:27:32.040]   I think they have like an again
[01:27:32.040 --> 01:27:35.960]   You can try I think it's like a five billion parameter the biggest one was 70 billion
[01:27:35.960 --> 01:27:40.840]   So these are smaller than gpt for gpt 3.5
[01:27:41.320 --> 01:27:45.880]   I mean, then even within those open AI models they have different levels as well. They have like
[01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:53.880]   Ada babbage kirry da Vinci of different sizes. So so in terms of what exactly it's trained on. I'm not sure is this
[01:27:53.880 --> 01:27:57.800]   Model dumber than a bigger model
[01:27:57.800 --> 01:28:05.080]   So my contention here is that like they've been the advance is that they've been able to train an on par model with
[01:28:05.080 --> 01:28:08.920]   A smaller set of data. It's a smaller set of data, but it's just as good
[01:28:09.880 --> 01:28:12.920]   It's been trained only on your facebook messages lea
[01:28:12.920 --> 01:28:16.600]   Well, that's the question
[01:28:16.600 --> 01:28:19.240]   I mean facebook has access to the entire corpus of
[01:28:19.240 --> 01:28:24.840]   Facebook messages. Is that what it's being trained on? No, probably we don't know the full details
[01:28:24.840 --> 01:28:28.280]   We don't know obviously a lot of the stuff is going to be on open source data sets
[01:28:28.280 --> 01:28:30.200]   but
[01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:37.560]   You know, they have the next is that the next front line in in ai in the battle over ai is where you get in this data
[01:28:38.200 --> 01:28:41.800]   You know, we saw that sarah silverman the comic is suing
[01:28:41.800 --> 01:28:49.720]   Open AI because she says it knows my book you must have given it my book because it can summarize it
[01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:52.280]   Number of authors are also suing
[01:28:52.280 --> 01:28:58.280]   Uh, is that the next front line of battles? Uh, we're just gonna see people saying well wait a minute you can't train on
[01:28:58.280 --> 01:29:05.400]   Copyright data you have to have a process. Where did this where did this come from as a legitimate question?
[01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:12.840]   Yeah, I think both from a copyright perspective it gets more interesting because all it takes is one case and then suddenly
[01:29:12.840 --> 01:29:20.920]   Trying to understand what a gigantic data set was actually trained on suddenly that could become a liability instead of just
[01:29:20.920 --> 01:29:23.480]   You know unending profit, but I also think
[01:29:23.480 --> 01:29:28.600]   It and again like i'm almost hopeful or optimistic around this you start to get more
[01:29:28.600 --> 01:29:34.840]   smaller verticalized models that are more geared towards solving specific problems again like a
[01:29:35.640 --> 01:29:37.880]   transcription model that's trained on
[01:29:37.880 --> 01:29:46.680]   HODECasts only could potentially be a lot smaller more efficient and and do that job better than a gigantic model
[01:29:46.680 --> 01:29:52.280]   So so I think it's it's if it moves in that direction. I think that's a good thing. Okay
[01:29:52.280 --> 01:29:55.240]   I obviously have a lot to learn
[01:29:55.240 --> 01:29:57.960]   about all of this
[01:29:57.960 --> 01:30:02.840]   By the way, and throughout our conversation. I keep checking to see if twitter has gotten rid of bloopers
[01:30:03.800 --> 01:30:09.160]   One thing that has happened is you can now go to x.com and it will redirect you to twitter
[01:30:09.160 --> 01:30:13.880]   elon's own decks calm since the days of paypal
[01:30:13.880 --> 01:30:17.480]   In fact somebody in our chat room is saying that paypal
[01:30:17.480 --> 01:30:22.440]   Peter teal took over from elon when elon tried to rename paypal to
[01:30:22.440 --> 01:30:25.240]   x
[01:30:25.240 --> 01:30:27.720]   So this is a long standing battle
[01:30:27.720 --> 01:30:31.000]   How do you get a one letter domain?
[01:30:31.720 --> 01:30:34.120]   Well, you had to buy it in the very early days. I think
[01:30:34.120 --> 01:30:36.840]   You can't get one now
[01:30:36.840 --> 01:30:42.360]   Are there any are there any others that are active? I actually I went to try a dot com b.com and
[01:30:42.360 --> 01:30:46.360]   At least those didn't work. And I was trying to think is this some kind of I can like
[01:30:46.360 --> 01:30:51.400]   I'm on c.com right now. It's japan's number one internet group. So
[01:30:51.400 --> 01:30:58.200]   All right.com and everyone's been saying on twitter that now zuckerberg is gonna buy y.com and named threads
[01:30:58.200 --> 01:31:00.760]   Why not calm can't be reached?
[01:31:00.760 --> 01:31:02.760]   Why not is the question
[01:31:02.760 --> 01:31:07.400]   Maybe it's because it's because in the middle of fin finalizing that purchase
[01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:14.840]   Wow, what a what a world we live in I swear it's just fascinating and that's so i'm i'm in it's wild
[01:31:14.840 --> 01:31:16.280]   Like i'm in san francisco right now
[01:31:16.280 --> 01:31:21.560]   And I just walked by the twitter ran by the twitter headquarters this morning and saw that elon has indeed
[01:31:21.560 --> 01:31:29.960]   Painted the w on the side of the building white can you believe what a nitwit i mean that is like the worst like stupid is jubin
[01:31:29.960 --> 01:31:30.840]   aisle
[01:31:30.840 --> 01:31:37.080]   Jokey embarrassing it's embarrassing. I lived here for six and a half years and to come back and just to see this
[01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:41.640]   You know kind of it's a disgrace really it's a disgrace and the and the same time he's not paying rent
[01:31:41.640 --> 01:31:43.720]   so
[01:31:43.720 --> 01:31:47.800]   They better at least paint that w blue if he's not going to pay for a rent on the building
[01:31:47.800 --> 01:31:52.440]   But who might have said he said in his midnight tweets this morning
[01:31:52.440 --> 01:31:59.000]   That he was going to chisel the twitter off the building they were just going to jack her and write right off the building
[01:31:59.960 --> 01:32:05.480]   I'd like to see he line up there with the you know the harness scaffolding and his own little chisel just taking
[01:32:05.480 --> 01:32:09.080]   I could totally say name on that are you kidding i could do see i'm doing that
[01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:14.920]   Yeah, do you think we'll never know the will we ever know the real story of like what
[01:32:14.920 --> 01:32:21.880]   Went on with these late night tweets or what he i think michael lewis is going to have to write the book and uh, i hope he does
[01:32:21.880 --> 01:32:23.080]   uh
[01:32:23.080 --> 01:32:29.320]   lewis who of course wrote money ball and so many great books about well he wrote about the finance industry was his first
[01:32:29.320 --> 01:32:34.680]   uh first book liars poker liars poker was such a classic so good
[01:32:34.680 --> 01:32:40.280]   Um, he was not gonna suggest that it was mushrooms. I won't suggest that
[01:32:40.280 --> 01:32:45.080]   I think it was though. I think you'd be right. I think you'd be exactly right
[01:32:45.080 --> 01:32:50.760]   Uh, let's take a break. We'll come back. We have a great panel. It is the big tech
[01:32:51.320 --> 01:32:56.440]   Podcast the big technology big technology. I'm sorry. I keep saying tech. Yeah. Yeah, why do you care?
[01:32:56.440 --> 01:33:02.920]   Because there's a big tech podcast and we're big if you put big tech podcast then it will get some wrong to show
[01:33:02.920 --> 01:33:05.000]   So we're big technology big technology
[01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:07.640]   Spell it out all the way, baby
[01:33:07.640 --> 01:33:12.680]   The big technology podcast and sub stack. Alex kantar wits is great to have you
[01:33:12.680 --> 01:33:16.840]   Uh ron john's great to meet you and have you ron john roy his friday
[01:33:17.320 --> 01:33:22.280]   Cohost on the show and man the interviews they get as you heard they've talked a lot yon la koon several times
[01:33:22.280 --> 01:33:24.200]   Just
[01:33:24.200 --> 01:33:28.840]   Fantastic you're you just knock it out of the park. We're glad to thank you leon here
[01:33:28.840 --> 01:33:32.920]   Our show day brought to you by collide speaking of knocking out of the park
[01:33:32.920 --> 01:33:37.480]   Collide is the thing you need a device trust solution if you're using octa
[01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:43.800]   Octa's great for authentication, but octa needs collide because collide
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:50.440]   ensures that if a device isn't trusted and secure it can't log into your cloud apps
[01:33:50.440 --> 01:33:57.080]   It's not enough just to have a authentication you need to know that that person is not bringing a payload in with them
[01:33:57.080 --> 01:34:03.160]   If you work in security or it and you use octa this message is for you
[01:34:03.160 --> 01:34:10.040]   There's one thing in common in all the big data breaches and hacks we've been reading about of the last few years
[01:34:10.040 --> 01:34:13.480]   It's the employees now. I'm not knocking the employees
[01:34:14.440 --> 01:34:19.560]   But it's often that's the way that bad guys get in sometimes an employee's device gets hacked
[01:34:19.560 --> 01:34:23.160]   Because maybe of unpatch software they've got oh, I don't know
[01:34:23.160 --> 01:34:27.960]   A copy of the plex server that hasn't been patched in three years on their laptop
[01:34:27.960 --> 01:34:34.600]   And then oh lo and behold somebody uses that to steal their AWS credentials and
[01:34:34.600 --> 01:34:39.560]   It's a huge cost in reputation and money to your company
[01:34:40.200 --> 01:34:45.160]   Maybe sometimes an employee would leave I don't know sensitive data in an unsecured place the ssh
[01:34:45.160 --> 01:34:49.400]   private keys in the download folder maybe
[01:34:49.400 --> 01:34:55.160]   And then of course it's practically every day a hacker breaks in using credentials fished
[01:34:55.160 --> 01:35:02.840]   From an employee now the problem isn't your end users the problem is those solutions that you're using they're supposed to prevent all of this
[01:35:02.840 --> 01:35:04.600]   They're not
[01:35:04.600 --> 01:35:09.400]   But doesn't have to be this way imagine a world just imagine this we're only secure devices
[01:35:09.880 --> 01:35:11.880]   Can access your cloud apps
[01:35:11.880 --> 01:35:15.000]   In this world fished credentials useless to hackers
[01:35:15.000 --> 01:35:21.240]   And you can manage every os windows max even linux all from a single dashboard in this world
[01:35:21.240 --> 01:35:28.760]   This is heaven you can get employees to fix their own device security issues without creating more for your it team
[01:35:28.760 --> 01:35:33.800]   Good news. You don't have to imagine it. Just start using collide
[01:35:34.520 --> 01:35:41.160]   K-O-L-I-D-E collide.com/twit booking on demand demo today see how it works for yourself
[01:35:41.160 --> 01:35:47.960]   This isn't just a must for any company that uses octa. It's the it's the second piece of the authentication
[01:35:47.960 --> 01:35:55.880]   K-O-L-I-D-E collide.com/twit we thank them so much for their support of this week in tech
[01:35:55.880 --> 01:36:01.400]   We continue on let's see we're talking about everything right
[01:36:04.120 --> 01:36:06.680]   We can talk a little bit about self-driving vehicles
[01:36:06.680 --> 01:36:14.360]   Um, you just took a ride in a waymo Alex. Welcome to san francisco. There's nobody ain't driving your car
[01:36:14.360 --> 01:36:21.000]   How'd you like it believable? How'd you like it? It was so it was just so cool. I mean you weren't nervous at all
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:25.800]   I was nervous for like the first 10 seconds, but it drives so smoothly and
[01:36:25.800 --> 01:36:30.280]   Like you just like sit in the backseat and literally in the front seat
[01:36:30.280 --> 01:36:36.120]   There's no driver and the steering wheel is moving you around san francisco and I just think that like
[01:36:36.120 --> 01:36:42.360]   This is much closer than a lot of people believe like there was this moment in 2017 where
[01:36:42.360 --> 01:36:47.160]   Um, you know folks were saying okay, we're gonna get to self-driving next year and it didn't happen
[01:36:47.160 --> 01:36:50.680]   So people just wrote it off for like the last five years. They're like it was supposed to be here
[01:36:50.680 --> 01:36:54.120]   It's not here. Well in the background these companies have been progressing
[01:36:54.120 --> 01:36:59.400]   Pretty impressively and having sat down in the car. You mean you see waymo's all over san francisco
[01:36:59.560 --> 01:37:03.480]   Oh, yeah, it's just an unbelievable and cruises and gm's though as well
[01:37:03.480 --> 01:37:07.400]   Absolutely. Yeah, and i'm definitely gonna get into cruis before before i'm here
[01:37:07.400 --> 01:37:14.200]   And by the way for for listeners. I have david risher the ceo of lift coming on the show in the next couple of weeks so
[01:37:14.200 --> 01:37:19.160]   Uh stand out for that like yeah tune in for that because we're gonna talk about self-driving also
[01:37:19.160 --> 01:37:20.680]   But this is gonna be a huge thing
[01:37:20.680 --> 01:37:24.280]   It's gonna be a new pillar in terms of the way that we get around it's gonna be rolled out
[01:37:24.280 --> 01:37:26.680]   The thing about technology
[01:37:26.680 --> 01:37:29.480]   Because you can you can roll out faster and scale faster
[01:37:29.480 --> 01:37:33.320]   Then the you and mine can conceive and it's gonna roll out in a bunch of different cities
[01:37:33.320 --> 01:37:37.560]   I'm fairly certain and we're gonna have a serious problem when it comes to to labor
[01:37:37.560 --> 01:37:46.520]   uh because you know if this thing is continues on its trajectory then drivers and you know places like uber and lift and traditional taxi services
[01:37:46.520 --> 01:37:51.160]   And then maybe even trucking are gonna have to start dealing with this as a threat to their jobs
[01:37:51.160 --> 01:37:56.040]   I mean it is it is extremely impressive the way that this thing operates
[01:37:56.600 --> 01:38:02.360]   And uh, I mean I've I'm gonna spend the rest of my time here writing these things because it's just unbelievable
[01:38:02.360 --> 01:38:09.160]   Wow, all right. It does it it's so I've heard somebody told me it drives like a grandma
[01:38:09.160 --> 01:38:15.640]   Yeah, but don't watch it's good. Grandmas drive how many grandmas i get in trouble for dey or reckless
[01:38:15.640 --> 01:38:19.160]   Right, they're like grandma. So it's okay. It's just like driving with me
[01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:21.640]   I mean shout out to the grandma drivers
[01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:27.480]   And if this can think and approximate that then we're gonna have you know, we were looking up to how many deaths are there?
[01:38:27.480 --> 01:38:33.080]   There are 13,000 deaths alcohol related from driving in the united states every year
[01:38:33.080 --> 01:38:36.360]   You know and then think about all the people who get dey eyes
[01:38:36.360 --> 01:38:43.720]   Right who uh whose lives can can be meaningfully altered because of this and if we turn driving over to the robots
[01:38:43.720 --> 01:38:48.520]   That's that tens of thousands of lives saved or 10,000 lives saved in just one country
[01:38:48.920 --> 01:38:55.560]   Any year and many thousands more impacted so I celebrate this. I think that you know, we'll have to deal with the labor stuff
[01:38:55.560 --> 01:38:59.720]   That's a really important issue, but if we can move to robotic cars, I think it's a great
[01:38:59.720 --> 01:39:04.120]   Advance for humanity in our civilization. Wait, but I I think
[01:39:04.120 --> 01:39:10.520]   You'd made the point that it's will scale like technology, which is greater than the human mind can fathom
[01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:18.200]   But will it scale like technology? Because again, this isn't software. This isn't bits. It's atoms like it's uh
[01:39:18.600 --> 01:39:23.400]   I think like what is what has impeded it from scaling to date?
[01:39:23.400 --> 01:39:27.560]   I think it's an important question because even for me like my honda
[01:39:27.560 --> 01:39:35.400]   Assisted driving mode on the highway essentially self-drives like for a while. I think this technology has been there for a long time
[01:39:35.400 --> 01:39:39.000]   Do you think to me? It's one of those questions where
[01:39:39.000 --> 01:39:43.000]   To scale it there has to be some kind of public
[01:39:43.800 --> 01:39:48.360]   Utility and trust around it. There has to be some kind of accepted regulatory
[01:39:48.360 --> 01:39:53.960]   You know approach to it everyone has to be on board. We have to start like you know
[01:39:53.960 --> 01:40:00.600]   Building highways around the technology which at least the way the industry has gone so far has not been the case
[01:40:00.600 --> 01:40:07.640]   I just think that a lot of these concerns are going to fall by the wayside once more people get inside these vehicles and experience this
[01:40:07.640 --> 01:40:09.640]   It made you a believer
[01:40:09.800 --> 01:40:15.240]   Absolutely, and I was sort of not I wasn't even a skeptic or I wasn't a believer beforehand. I was just like all right
[01:40:15.240 --> 01:40:19.480]   That's never gonna happen and then just be that's me still
[01:40:19.480 --> 01:40:22.280]   You're
[01:40:22.280 --> 01:40:28.360]   When you talk to the lift CEO because really lived in uber were founded with on the premise that we wouldn't
[01:40:28.360 --> 01:40:33.080]   The it's not an sustainable business if you have to pay humans to drive the cars
[01:40:33.080 --> 01:40:36.360]   It's founded on the premise that we will eventually all be self-driving
[01:40:37.080 --> 01:40:41.320]   Exactly. So we did talk about that. It's gonna be his first podcast interview since taking over lived
[01:40:41.320 --> 01:40:44.680]   So folks should look out for that coming out in the weeks. Okay
[01:40:44.680 --> 01:40:47.000]   Uh, yeah, I mean
[01:40:47.000 --> 01:40:54.840]   I think the reason people were willing to watch uber rack up huge losses year after year is that there was this premise that at some point
[01:40:54.840 --> 01:40:57.560]   Uh, this would be financially viable
[01:40:57.560 --> 01:41:00.200]   But it's just taking longer than anybody thought
[01:41:00.200 --> 01:41:02.600]   Yeah
[01:41:02.600 --> 01:41:07.640]   So I think it's gonna I think we're at an inflection point here watching the way san francisco is not exactly an easy
[01:41:07.640 --> 01:41:14.360]   City driving and there have been a lot of stories about crews and more crews than than waymo
[01:41:14.360 --> 01:41:21.000]   But about crews vehicles, you know blocking intersections blocking emergency vehicles getting lost having a
[01:41:21.000 --> 01:41:25.400]   There was one street in san francisco where there was just a constant parade of
[01:41:25.400 --> 01:41:30.600]   Self-driving vehicles coming down making a u-turn and coming back because they refused to turn
[01:41:31.320 --> 01:41:33.320]   Making a legal left turn
[01:41:33.320 --> 01:41:35.240]   Uh
[01:41:35.240 --> 01:41:39.640]   Normal drivers just go yeah, right. I'm not going and would make the left turn but the car would continue
[01:41:39.640 --> 01:41:41.560]   Well, I can't turn there. I need to turn there
[01:41:41.560 --> 01:41:43.560]   So i'm going to go down the cul-de-sac
[01:41:43.560 --> 01:41:48.120]   Gonna get you two in the cul-de-sac. It's very interesting. Uh, they obeyed the law
[01:41:48.120 --> 01:41:51.480]   But it was right and the whole for the cul-de-sac people
[01:41:51.480 --> 01:41:54.520]   They weren't the one that I was in was also just like no
[01:41:54.520 --> 01:41:58.840]   Not making that turn too risky and it dropped me off a little bit further away from my destination
[01:41:58.920 --> 01:42:03.320]   Interesting or just kind of in a boarded mission in terms of a turn that's underneath it to make
[01:42:03.320 --> 01:42:06.760]   But not the end of the world you were able to walk to your look absolutely
[01:42:06.760 --> 01:42:13.560]   But I also I think that point you make around the a normal driver would take that left but their point of
[01:42:13.560 --> 01:42:14.760]   rules. I think yeah
[01:42:14.760 --> 01:42:21.720]   Yeah, exactly. I think it's a reminder though that we need and and I am very hopeful and optimistic around the technology
[01:42:21.720 --> 01:42:23.800]   I hate driving. I hope like
[01:42:23.800 --> 01:42:28.280]   You know this I can just sit in a four-hour car ride and do whatever I want rather than
[01:42:28.680 --> 01:42:37.480]   Have to actually pay attention. That's the dream, but you know like we I think it's the more productive car companies can be in terms of actually
[01:42:37.480 --> 01:42:41.000]   Engaging and how we build our roads and stuff. I think it's going to be
[01:42:41.000 --> 01:42:45.560]   Really important to make sure this technology actually does scale and I actually think
[01:42:45.560 --> 01:42:51.000]   not to bring it back to elon again, but I think it's better the fact that
[01:42:51.000 --> 01:42:58.600]   Waymos and the crews and eventually forward in gm and everyone as they're driving this technology as well
[01:42:59.240 --> 01:43:07.080]   They're going to engage with regulators and highway safety and make sure this stuff is done properly rather than trying to kind of you know
[01:43:07.080 --> 01:43:14.200]   Blow through everything and fight against everyone. So so I'm hopeful. I did and I hope it comes fast
[01:43:14.200 --> 01:43:20.600]   It will it definitely will if if robots can play ping pong
[01:43:20.600 --> 01:43:23.800]   Is it it's just a matter of time
[01:43:27.320 --> 01:43:32.360]   I have seen those robot ping pong. There's no joy in the game. There's no joy. They don't enjoy what they're doing
[01:43:32.360 --> 01:43:37.480]   They do not say they're human beings. They're loving. I hope to god. They don't enjoy it. I would hate to see
[01:43:37.480 --> 01:43:40.280]   I think this is fake
[01:43:40.280 --> 01:43:42.520]   Sure, this is fake
[01:43:42.520 --> 01:43:47.800]   I've seen that in person not the robots what you know the other ones
[01:43:47.800 --> 01:43:51.080]   They're wearing a machine. Yeah. Yeah. No, I've seen those and she goes to you know
[01:43:51.080 --> 01:43:55.400]   It just goes to show you there's some things that robots should do and some things that robots shouldn't not get guys
[01:43:55.400 --> 01:43:58.520]   Just proving it's it's proving its ability to do stuff
[01:43:58.520 --> 01:44:01.960]   But like give it the joyless stuff. How do you feel about it writing articles?
[01:44:01.960 --> 01:44:06.040]   Vox and vox media
[01:44:06.040 --> 01:44:08.440]   the CEO of
[01:44:08.440 --> 01:44:11.160]   Geo media which owns
[01:44:11.160 --> 01:44:12.920]   which owns
[01:44:12.920 --> 01:44:14.920]   gizmodo and
[01:44:14.920 --> 01:44:16.440]   the onion
[01:44:16.440 --> 01:44:18.440]   and jazabel
[01:44:18.440 --> 01:44:22.760]   Says get ready because more and more of our articles are going to be written
[01:44:23.400 --> 01:44:27.080]   by AI it's absolutely maryll browns is it's absolutely
[01:44:27.080 --> 01:44:31.160]   a thing we want to do with more of maryll browns the editorial director
[01:44:31.160 --> 01:44:32.440]   at
[01:44:32.440 --> 01:44:35.000]   Geo, I know I can can geo write a
[01:44:35.000 --> 01:44:37.880]   a humerous article in the
[01:44:37.880 --> 01:44:40.040]   Like the onion
[01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:44.520]   Like let's wait until they can write a funny onion article with automation before we imagine
[01:44:44.520 --> 01:44:47.800]   This is going to be anything besides like the least quality
[01:44:48.120 --> 01:44:53.880]   List stories. Yes, it's not going to be people aren't going to read publications because there's a good AI
[01:44:53.880 --> 01:44:56.680]   It might fill in some of the gaps in some ways
[01:44:56.680 --> 01:44:59.880]   But it's not going to be able to do any of the differentiated writing
[01:44:59.880 --> 01:45:03.720]   So for the writers that are on staff if you can't do better than the
[01:45:03.720 --> 01:45:09.400]   Undifferentiated AI there are bigger questions you need to be asking besides the eyes ability to take your work
[01:45:09.400 --> 01:45:15.560]   It's it takes away the the grunt work articles the the listicles the the things that really know
[01:45:16.120 --> 01:45:19.720]   You know, this is what cnets said when Connie gili. I almost said when she was on our show
[01:45:19.720 --> 01:45:26.440]   Uh, is that nobody wants to write those articles and those are those that's the grunt work and it can do those just
[01:45:26.440 --> 01:45:33.240]   Not that and that's the perfect representation of where it should or it could work well is the idea that
[01:45:33.240 --> 01:45:39.880]   The grunt work the repetitive stuff the stuff you don't really want to do but potentially does need to get done
[01:45:39.880 --> 01:45:45.320]   It does that for you and then you have more time to actually write differentiated content because again
[01:45:45.800 --> 01:45:47.800]   Remember generative AI
[01:45:47.800 --> 01:45:50.440]   Everything is about taking what's already out there
[01:45:50.440 --> 01:45:57.000]   So if you're writing something completely original if you're you should you know, you will not be replaced
[01:45:57.000 --> 01:45:59.000]   so I i'm still
[01:45:59.000 --> 01:46:02.760]   Bullish on the idea that it can do the grunt work
[01:46:02.760 --> 01:46:05.560]   But I actually think the bigger implication for the media businesses
[01:46:05.560 --> 01:46:08.440]   When everyone can write that repetitive?
[01:46:09.000 --> 01:46:17.240]   Listicle article in near instantaneous real time like that actually changes the economics of how those businesses worked before
[01:46:17.240 --> 01:46:23.400]   And again, like it's writing an seo friendly listicle might have brought in some ad dollars in the past
[01:46:23.400 --> 01:46:28.440]   But if anyone can throw up a media site and get that traffic and create that same article
[01:46:28.440 --> 01:46:32.440]   I think that it does pose a bigger challenge to media companies
[01:46:32.440 --> 01:46:37.080]   Do you think that the writers guild and the actors
[01:46:38.360 --> 01:46:44.040]   Struck at the wrong moment that they could that this is the moment the studios are going to step up and say good
[01:46:44.040 --> 01:46:46.680]   We guess when we got to a tip replace you
[01:46:46.680 --> 01:46:49.480]   AI
[01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:51.480]   Or or is it not there yet?
[01:46:51.480 --> 01:46:55.000]   I think it's not there in almost all use cases
[01:46:55.000 --> 01:46:56.920]   So this would be like the last large
[01:46:56.920 --> 01:47:01.640]   This would be the last time the last moment that are the writers and sak could go on strike is
[01:47:01.640 --> 01:47:04.200]   We better do it now because in a few years
[01:47:04.200 --> 01:47:07.320]   We're our livelihoods will be threatened
[01:47:07.960 --> 01:47:09.160]   Yes, that's the other side of it
[01:47:09.160 --> 01:47:13.000]   So like it's not going to take away like any actors jobs right now
[01:47:13.000 --> 01:47:18.760]   But there are some like yeah precedent setting moments where they can really have a make a difference here. So for instance
[01:47:18.760 --> 01:47:25.000]   There uh, there's a line in this proposed contract that allows background performers
[01:47:25.000 --> 01:47:27.720]   So not like you know the tom cruises of the world
[01:47:27.720 --> 01:47:33.880]   But like the folks who are in the background of extras of a show yeah extras or even maybe someone with like one line
[01:47:33.880 --> 01:47:36.920]   I don't fully know what the definition is but something in in that realm
[01:47:37.640 --> 01:47:41.160]   They can get like scanned and processed and like then
[01:47:41.160 --> 01:47:46.600]   Get paid a one-time fee and the studios can use their likeness for in perpetuity if they'd like so
[01:47:46.600 --> 01:47:51.000]   You know, I think that that is you know one place where this you know, you could start to have your fight
[01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:54.120]   But then again like we've also had CGI extras
[01:47:54.120 --> 01:47:57.880]   you know for a long time now, so
[01:47:57.880 --> 01:48:04.680]   Uh, it seems to me like this is really about some other stuff and they're using this as like a rallying cry for their members
[01:48:04.760 --> 01:48:07.800]   and and you know by all means go ahead and do it but
[01:48:07.800 --> 01:48:12.440]   like I don't think that we're going to be in a position where we're going to have
[01:48:12.440 --> 01:48:16.680]   Uh AI actors start to create leading entertainment
[01:48:16.680 --> 01:48:19.880]   And again, if you're an actor and you can't do better than an AI
[01:48:19.880 --> 01:48:24.280]   Uh, then it's time to ask some bigger questions than whether an AI can replace you
[01:48:24.280 --> 01:48:27.160]   Yeah, and I think
[01:48:27.160 --> 01:48:34.520]   Using AI is kind of the like central theme or talking point from like the pr side of the entire strike has been smart
[01:48:35.000 --> 01:48:41.640]   I think like it makes it much more targeted rather than an entire business model is broken and talking about
[01:48:41.640 --> 01:48:49.240]   The earnings of disney and like it was you know, losses on streaming services and the changing nature of a broken business model
[01:48:49.240 --> 01:48:55.800]   I think talking about they're gonna try to steal my the I mean when Alex says that line like I mean you're gonna remember it
[01:48:55.800 --> 01:49:02.360]   We all remember it the idea that they're gonna scan me and then use my likeness and perpetuity for a day's pay
[01:49:03.400 --> 01:49:10.600]   No one anywhere is gonna feel good about that. I actually can't believe they put that into a any kind of negotiation
[01:49:10.600 --> 01:49:15.880]   Because someone somewhere should have told someone to not do that but but I I think
[01:49:15.880 --> 01:49:25.880]   Still especially visual especially acting. I think we're we're a long ways away from anything being like severely affected by AI
[01:49:25.880 --> 01:49:31.800]   The Biden administration has announced well, you know
[01:49:32.680 --> 01:49:34.680]   for a long time the
[01:49:34.680 --> 01:49:41.560]   Knock on Silicon Valley was a startup would would ship the t-shirt and then start working on the project
[01:49:41.560 --> 01:49:45.800]   Uh the product the Biden administration has shipped the t-shirt
[01:49:45.800 --> 01:49:48.440]   Uh, there's a new cybersecurity
[01:49:48.440 --> 01:49:52.040]   label the cyber trust mark
[01:49:52.040 --> 01:49:54.840]   that would establish
[01:49:54.840 --> 01:49:58.520]   that uh some iot device you're about to buy has
[01:49:59.080 --> 01:50:01.080]   satisfied certain requirements
[01:50:01.080 --> 01:50:03.640]   from the cyber trust mark
[01:50:03.640 --> 01:50:10.280]   Program and has earned the cyber trust mark. Of course. We just don't know what those requirements are and they really haven't
[01:50:10.280 --> 01:50:14.040]   Haven't said yet. I think it's a great idea
[01:50:14.040 --> 01:50:22.840]   Uh, they're talking about privacy as well as a security one of the requirements would be that the iot device can be updated over the air
[01:50:22.840 --> 01:50:28.600]   Uh, so that you can I mean there are a lot of iot devices that have security flaws that cannot be patched
[01:50:28.920 --> 01:50:30.360]   these days
[01:50:30.360 --> 01:50:31.720]   for instance
[01:50:31.720 --> 01:50:37.240]   Uh, the side seem like uh, so I go ahead the cyber trust mark, uh will
[01:50:37.240 --> 01:50:45.560]   Bear with signify the devices bearing it meets security standards based on those established and report by the national institute of standard in technology
[01:50:45.560 --> 01:50:48.520]   Uh expected to be
[01:50:48.520 --> 01:50:52.280]   2024 labeled hitting devices
[01:50:52.280 --> 01:50:55.000]   soon thereafter. This is the
[01:50:55.000 --> 01:50:57.880]   these nists
[01:50:57.880 --> 01:51:01.960]   profile of the iart iot core baseline for consumer
[01:51:01.960 --> 01:51:07.800]   Iot products that they're talking about. I think this is a great idea
[01:51:07.800 --> 01:51:11.160]   Just you know, it's more than a year off at this point
[01:51:11.160 --> 01:51:15.480]   It also seems like something that was hatched by industry to
[01:51:15.480 --> 01:51:21.720]   Make the incumbent sell more refrigerators. It's calmed down. Well, that's what they did with the EPA
[01:51:22.280 --> 01:51:29.080]   Logo, right and when you buy a refrigerator nowadays, it's got a big EPA rating on it as to its energy efficiency
[01:51:29.080 --> 01:51:30.920]   But that's a good thing, right?
[01:51:30.920 --> 01:51:38.520]   I think it's a good thing. I just would say that this all these programs tend to be either a written by the industry players that will tend to benefit
[01:51:38.520 --> 01:51:45.720]   The most by them that's typically what happens right or be they they find a way to use these terms or use these labels
[01:51:45.720 --> 01:51:47.880]   to find find
[01:51:47.880 --> 01:51:54.760]   You know companies that don't necessarily meet all the all the standards or don't really fit the spirit of the program end up getting like the gold standard of them
[01:51:54.760 --> 01:51:57.800]   Like esg for instance has been one of these
[01:51:57.800 --> 01:52:03.880]   Type of labels that's actually been manipulated by industry incumbents. We're like you now have oil companies there
[01:52:03.880 --> 01:52:06.360]   You know their esg companies
[01:52:06.360 --> 01:52:11.160]   Um, you know because they find a way to wiggle into these into these terminology
[01:52:11.160 --> 01:52:13.240]   I just think that like putting this official
[01:52:13.560 --> 01:52:20.440]   Government stamp on it as opposed to having the companies try to market it themselves and like actually win on the merits is an issue
[01:52:20.440 --> 01:52:23.240]   Yes environmental what is environmental's?
[01:52:23.240 --> 01:52:33.640]   Social governance social governance three different things. So it's running a company in a responsible way basically environmentally and socially. Yes
[01:52:33.640 --> 01:52:39.160]   And having good governance and having good governance. Yes. I remember when I was a kid
[01:52:39.720 --> 01:52:46.440]   We went on a tour of a power plant the narrow Gansett power plant which was run on probably on coal back in the days
[01:52:46.440 --> 01:52:49.880]   And I mean I know it was because it had big scrubbers on the stacks it
[01:52:49.880 --> 01:52:53.720]   Every month would dump soot on my windowsill when they blew out the scrubbers
[01:52:53.720 --> 01:52:55.480]   um
[01:52:55.480 --> 01:52:57.640]   And it had um all over
[01:52:57.640 --> 01:53:02.280]   All over the plant and this is in the 60s. It had
[01:53:02.280 --> 01:53:03.880]   uh
[01:53:03.880 --> 01:53:09.640]   You know environmental slogans, you know, um, I can't remember what the slogan of the time was kind of
[01:53:09.720 --> 01:53:13.880]   Earth day period where you know, don't pollute be good, you know green
[01:53:13.880 --> 01:53:17.320]   I think green may be everywhere and I asked my teacher
[01:53:17.320 --> 01:53:21.560]   That's interesting because this is a coal fired power plant that's pumping soot onto my windowsill
[01:53:21.560 --> 01:53:23.960]   uh, what's the deal with the green he said
[01:53:23.960 --> 01:53:29.000]   If you post this everywhere and you post it enough people will become immune to it
[01:53:29.000 --> 01:53:31.080]   And then you won't have to worry about actually doing it
[01:53:31.080 --> 01:53:34.200]   Yeah
[01:53:34.200 --> 01:53:39.480]   Do you know who came up with the this one still always fascinates me who came up with the concept of a person
[01:53:39.800 --> 01:53:43.640]   Carbon footprint the idea that you need to think about your own emissions who?
[01:53:43.640 --> 01:53:46.840]   British petroleum
[01:53:46.840 --> 01:53:53.320]   Yeah, I think it's like too that it was a marketing campaign and it was uh, and it's one of those at like every time I worry
[01:53:53.320 --> 01:53:55.960]   I'm we're not the problem. You're the problem
[01:53:55.960 --> 01:53:58.840]   Think about your brilliant piece
[01:53:58.840 --> 01:54:03.000]   It's because the more complex you make it and the more difficult to
[01:54:03.000 --> 01:54:09.080]   Understand it's it's brilliant on their side, but but on the iot side. I okay
[01:54:09.880 --> 01:54:12.760]   As a someone do you use any smart home?
[01:54:12.760 --> 01:54:17.800]   I do I have a doorbell and I have every room has an echo and a
[01:54:17.800 --> 01:54:24.600]   Google and a syrian there and listening to every word I say and we have some huylights that kind of stuff
[01:54:24.600 --> 01:54:29.640]   Yeah, and and how easy or difficult was it to get that stuff murder?
[01:54:29.640 --> 01:54:32.600]   It's murder right?
[01:54:32.600 --> 01:54:37.960]   I have I obsess I'm a little obsessed with this stuff and bla and sickle up and down
[01:54:38.520 --> 01:54:44.440]   Every room and I switched over to the home pod and the entire kind of apple home kid infrastructure
[01:54:44.440 --> 01:54:48.680]   It's murdered and what's compatible with what is you never know?
[01:54:48.680 --> 01:54:53.880]   Have the stuff doesn't work or you have to like try to you know, even the setup is murder
[01:54:53.880 --> 01:54:59.160]   But this is one area where the whole entire iot industry with the matter protocol
[01:54:59.160 --> 01:55:07.400]   I think has been incredibly fascinating. It's been an actual standardization across all these different protocols that everyone has gotten on board
[01:55:07.880 --> 01:55:13.240]   Everyone apple amazon google that every device should start to all you know
[01:55:13.240 --> 01:55:18.440]   Hit this same protocol and actually be compatible and I think it's something where
[01:55:18.440 --> 01:55:26.120]   Thinking about it must have gotten to a point where they realize they will never be able to actually make scale this industry
[01:55:26.120 --> 01:55:29.080]   Because it's just too difficult to make anything work
[01:55:29.080 --> 01:55:31.160]   Um, so
[01:55:31.160 --> 01:55:35.880]   When they actually have their back against a wall and something is not working for consumers
[01:55:36.440 --> 01:55:40.840]   It was a reminder at least it's one hopeful moment that they will get together and uh
[01:55:40.840 --> 01:55:45.480]   And actually make something and good for the consumer kumbaya, baby
[01:55:45.480 --> 01:55:48.040]   Yeah, guys you just matter
[01:55:48.040 --> 01:55:50.040]   cynics you're just cynics that's
[01:55:50.040 --> 01:55:53.000]   But you're right. I believe it's anything cars. Yeah
[01:55:53.000 --> 01:55:59.000]   I think it's there's something like when this is a thing like, you know, I I think there's a lot
[01:55:59.000 --> 01:56:04.520]   There's there's worth the well-merited criticism and when we believe in something we're gonna talk about it
[01:56:04.600 --> 01:56:08.440]   So it's like it's supposed to being on the side on one
[01:56:08.440 --> 01:56:11.080]   Totally on the side of industry or totally on the side of the critics
[01:56:11.080 --> 01:56:12.760]   I think what's nice about
[01:56:12.760 --> 01:56:17.320]   Dynamic we have is like when something is great. We'll say it's great and when something sucks. We'll say it sucks
[01:56:17.320 --> 01:56:24.120]   Yeah, and uh and again my entire home is just outfitted with home pods as far as the I can see it works
[01:56:24.120 --> 01:56:26.520]   It works
[01:56:26.520 --> 01:56:31.480]   And then suddenly one thing will break and my wife will kill me because I have all these different scenes set for each
[01:56:32.200 --> 01:56:36.040]   Like turn it to kids bedtime and it doesn't work and so
[01:56:36.040 --> 01:56:38.760]   Kids are off time midnight
[01:56:38.760 --> 01:56:46.280]   Yeah, it works perfectly and then I feel good but but it will thanks to the matter protocol. Oh, that's hope we can but hope
[01:56:46.280 --> 01:56:53.960]   I have some hope in massachusetts. They're planning to ban the collection of cell phone location
[01:56:53.960 --> 01:56:56.920]   data
[01:56:56.920 --> 01:56:59.960]   This is something that frankly the congress should be doing
[01:57:00.760 --> 01:57:09.160]   Um, but there as uh carl bode writes in the techter the us has long been too corrupt to pass even a basic privacy law
[01:57:09.160 --> 01:57:11.640]   for the internet
[01:57:11.640 --> 01:57:18.360]   Most regulatory actions at agencies like the fcc are theatrical at best carl is another angry man
[01:57:18.360 --> 01:57:22.040]   And while the fdc has been taking specific action against some companies
[01:57:22.040 --> 01:57:26.600]   We're not doing in much in terms of an overarching solution for the broader problem
[01:57:26.600 --> 01:57:29.640]   Which means it's often as often the case is left to the states
[01:57:30.600 --> 01:57:34.360]   So massachusetts which is preparing to be the first state of the nation
[01:57:34.360 --> 01:57:40.120]   To ban the collection and monetization of user cell phone location
[01:57:40.120 --> 01:57:44.440]   Data it's not a law yet. It's called the location shield act
[01:57:44.440 --> 01:57:48.360]   massachusetts state legislature held a hearing last month
[01:57:48.360 --> 01:57:55.240]   On it a sweeping proposal that would sharply curtail the practice of collecting and selling location data
[01:57:55.720 --> 01:58:03.560]   Drawn from mobile phones in state it would all so institute a warrant requirement for law enforcement access to location data
[01:58:03.560 --> 01:58:05.880]   Did you know by the way they don't need a warrant?
[01:58:05.880 --> 01:58:08.200]   They just need a it's called a pen register and they can
[01:58:08.200 --> 01:58:11.240]   They're in fact that most of the cell phone companies have a portal
[01:58:11.240 --> 01:58:16.040]   With law enforcement for a couple of bucks can just log in and find out where you've been what you up to
[01:58:16.040 --> 01:58:23.160]   The bill would also ban data brokers from providing location information about state residents without quote authorization
[01:58:24.680 --> 01:58:28.680]   You know law enforcement does not like a bill like this. They like to be able to do this
[01:58:28.680 --> 01:58:35.800]   It's much easier for congress to say tiktok china bad get rid of them than to actually pass an effective
[01:58:35.800 --> 01:58:39.320]   privacy bill
[01:58:39.320 --> 01:58:41.320]   um
[01:58:41.320 --> 01:58:46.200]   According to carl and tiktert it's it seems likely that this will this will pass
[01:58:46.200 --> 01:58:52.360]   The bill is expected to be passed but carl says i wouldn't be shocked because he's acidic
[01:58:52.680 --> 01:58:59.240]   I wouldn't be shocked if it's dramatically weakened or modified before that happens law enforcement and industry definitely doesn't
[01:58:59.240 --> 01:59:01.800]   want massachusetts
[01:59:01.800 --> 01:59:09.400]   To break a to disrupt a very broken and very profitable status quo several decades in the making rates carl bodey
[01:59:09.400 --> 01:59:13.080]   But you all would be in favor of such a law, right?
[01:59:13.080 --> 01:59:20.040]   I like it for sure. I mean I think that like i'm often and especially with like you know phones apps
[01:59:20.120 --> 01:59:23.160]   You know you see what they collect and they obviously collect more than they need
[01:59:23.160 --> 01:59:28.520]   And so yeah, there's there should be some protections in terms of like, you know, why isn't this
[01:59:28.520 --> 01:59:33.480]   You know something universal where they cannot collect this stuff like it doesn't it's just no
[01:59:33.480 --> 01:59:38.680]   There's no reason to especially like on you know on the phone for instance like there are things that happen that should never happen
[01:59:38.680 --> 01:59:42.520]   And you know, it's like nice to see that massachusetts is taking the initiative here
[01:59:42.520 --> 01:59:47.240]   I don't know if it will actually spread. I mean it would be nice if it's spread, but I think that like here's a theory that
[01:59:48.360 --> 01:59:52.920]   When snowden came out with his revelations because these all have like they're all downstream of that
[01:59:52.920 --> 01:59:57.720]   People were initially like oh my god. What's happening and then
[01:59:57.720 --> 02:00:00.360]   You know they were kind of like all right whatever
[02:00:00.360 --> 02:00:04.840]   And the second that happened it was almost as if like it was difficult for
[02:00:04.840 --> 02:00:07.640]   For any of this privacy stuff to gain
[02:00:07.640 --> 02:00:14.040]   Momentum because it's like sort of like the biggest bombshells have already had already been revealed in the response smuted
[02:00:14.040 --> 02:00:17.560]   So, you know, we'll see you know little things like this and that's good
[02:00:18.040 --> 02:00:21.720]   um, but in terms of like having something like this be the law of the land
[02:00:21.720 --> 02:00:25.080]   A little more skeptical that that could actually happen
[02:00:25.080 --> 02:00:27.720]   Meanwhile be it go ahead
[02:00:27.720 --> 02:00:32.120]   I was going to say I I feel the regulation needs to be around
[02:00:32.120 --> 02:00:40.440]   The profit incentives and the profit motives behind this stuff because as as Alex said and we've seen repeatedly like from a consumer perspective
[02:00:40.440 --> 02:00:47.960]   It's terrifying at moments and then everyone forgets about it because it's so difficult to process exactly what's going on
[02:00:48.120 --> 02:00:51.320]   and try to like, you know see under the hood and the web of
[02:00:51.320 --> 02:00:57.880]   Adtech companies and data brokers and what's moving where it's like incomprehensible for the average person
[02:00:57.880 --> 02:01:01.400]   So you just forget about it and scroll your threads and
[02:01:01.400 --> 02:01:07.720]   Instagram feed or whatever else so so I think it's it it's up to regulators and
[02:01:07.720 --> 02:01:14.040]   policy makers to really focus on what who's making money and where and what's okay because again
[02:01:14.120 --> 02:01:20.280]   I think the I agree the law enforcement argument is almost guaranteed to derail this effort because
[02:01:20.280 --> 02:01:27.000]   You know you go out and you say obviously there's some number of people that are always going to be wary of that, but the safety
[02:01:27.000 --> 02:01:35.320]   Claim i'm sure will convince any uh enough people that they want this to be allowed for law enforcement to be able to track people
[02:01:35.320 --> 02:01:39.000]   So I think it's just a it has to live at the layer of
[02:01:39.000 --> 02:01:41.560]   Who's making money off of you?
[02:01:41.960 --> 02:01:45.480]   And your location at any point, which is still definitely a lot of people
[02:01:45.480 --> 02:01:52.360]   Yeah law enforcement is always going to say but we do so much of a better job when we know where everybody is what they're up to what they've
[02:01:52.360 --> 02:01:59.880]   Been doing so don't get in our way, but uh at least uh in this country. We've had a long standing belief that
[02:01:59.880 --> 02:02:01.800]   uh
[02:02:01.800 --> 02:02:04.200]   Perfect law enforcement is not necessary
[02:02:04.200 --> 02:02:10.680]   If it impinges on the freedom and liberty of the people if it's anti constitutional
[02:02:11.160 --> 02:02:16.840]   The senate is considering a bill a new bill the bipartisan cooper davis act
[02:02:16.840 --> 02:02:19.560]   uh on behalf of the dea
[02:02:19.560 --> 02:02:23.320]   Uh requiring social media companies
[02:02:23.320 --> 02:02:29.480]   Encrypted communications providers and other online services report drug activity on their platforms
[02:02:29.480 --> 02:02:33.000]   To the dea advance to the senate floor on thursday
[02:02:33.000 --> 02:02:40.760]   Uh, you know it's for a good cause right it's named cooper davis was a kansas teenager who died after unknowingly
[02:02:41.240 --> 02:02:44.040]   Taking a fentanyl laced pill he bought on snapchat
[02:02:44.040 --> 02:02:48.840]   Well in that case we've got a we've got to be make these guys reported
[02:02:48.840 --> 02:02:53.080]   Requires social media companies other web communication providers to give the dea
[02:02:53.080 --> 02:03:00.040]   Users names and other information with the companies of actual knowledge that illicit drugs are being distributed on their platform. However
[02:03:00.040 --> 02:03:03.720]   If this bill passes privacy advocates caution
[02:03:03.720 --> 02:03:07.080]   There could be a death blow to end to end encryption
[02:03:08.440 --> 02:03:10.040]   Because it includes
[02:03:10.040 --> 02:03:12.760]   language holding companies accountable for conduct
[02:03:12.760 --> 02:03:17.000]   They don't report if they quote deliberately blind themselves
[02:03:17.000 --> 02:03:20.760]   To the violation how would they deliberate? Oh by encrypting
[02:03:20.760 --> 02:03:27.800]   And then encryption well now they're liable because they uh, they we need to know uh if this activity is occurring
[02:03:27.800 --> 02:03:37.400]   So massachusetts residents, please write your state legislators and say good thing. Please
[02:03:38.040 --> 02:03:41.640]   Pass this bill protect us against data collection about our location
[02:03:41.640 --> 02:03:46.520]   And the rest of us write your congress critters saying the cooper davis act is
[02:03:46.520 --> 02:03:49.160]   you know, I think
[02:03:49.160 --> 02:03:51.160]   uh, uh
[02:03:51.160 --> 02:03:53.160]   Red herring it's being introduced
[02:03:53.160 --> 02:03:57.560]   Yeah, save the kansas teenagers from buying fennel based pills on snapchat
[02:03:57.560 --> 02:04:00.600]   But really it is to end end to end encryption
[02:04:00.600 --> 02:04:04.760]   Uh, and I think this is clearly problematic
[02:04:07.160 --> 02:04:10.520]   Uh, and yet it's moving along quite quickly of course in congress because
[02:04:10.520 --> 02:04:15.560]   You know, nobody's in favor of fennel laced pills on snapchat
[02:04:15.560 --> 02:04:25.240]   All right little break, uh, then a couple of final words with our great takeover from the big technology
[02:04:25.240 --> 02:04:27.400]   podcast
[02:04:27.400 --> 02:04:31.400]   Alex kantruitz great to have you I should also mention that uh, uh,
[02:04:31.400 --> 02:04:36.280]   Our other guest also has uh his own newsletter on sub stack called read margin
[02:04:36.840 --> 02:04:41.400]   read margins read margins. What is read margins about rajan roy?
[02:04:41.400 --> 02:04:46.520]   the we the technology of business and the business of technology we try to
[02:04:46.520 --> 02:04:52.520]   Look at, uh, the underlying kind of stories that connect technology and business together. So that's how
[02:04:52.520 --> 02:04:58.760]   The big technology podcast and margins got together. Nice similar types of stories
[02:04:58.760 --> 02:05:01.720]   Yeah, I basically read a bunch of rajan stories
[02:05:02.200 --> 02:05:07.720]   over a winter break and dm to him and was like, please come on the show and he came on a couple of times and
[02:05:07.720 --> 02:05:12.120]   We had some good conversations and then it's like you can see if you're if you're listening now
[02:05:12.120 --> 02:05:18.440]   like rajan's like a brilliant business and tech analyst and we had uh sudden great conversations and
[02:05:18.440 --> 02:05:22.200]   In january or coming up on january, I was like, why don't we just do this every week?
[02:05:22.200 --> 02:05:25.640]   So he added a show on fridays. That's a quick show 45 minutes or so

[02:05:31.400 --> 02:05:34.200]   Well, that's exactly what i'm talking about
[02:05:34.200 --> 02:05:38.520]   You can read read margins. You can listen to big technology or do both

[02:08:13.080 --> 02:08:16.600]   Creating a voluntary program kind of like the epa's energy star thing
[02:08:16.600 --> 02:08:20.440]   And if you see this on a product you can trust it

[02:12:15.320 --> 02:12:19.240]   Very sad, but I thought I would use this occasion to bring up
[02:12:20.040 --> 02:12:24.440]   An episode of the screen savers we did 20 years ago
[02:12:24.440 --> 02:12:27.400]   when kevin joined us
[02:12:27.400 --> 02:12:30.520]   Now remember he'd been convicted of hacking and
[02:12:30.520 --> 02:12:36.200]   The conditions of his parole was that he would not go on the internet for some time
[02:12:36.200 --> 02:12:39.400]   Uh 20 years ago

[02:17:47.800 --> 02:17:59.240]   That's the sound of a crack in the ceiling found at a home inspection
[02:17:59.240 --> 02:18:03.480]   But with a real tour by your side a new found leak might only cause minor worries
[02:18:03.480 --> 02:18:10.840]   With their expertise a realtor can suggest a credit at closing and even connect you to a contractor to help you shore up that leak and alleviate your worries
[02:18:10.840 --> 02:18:15.560]   When it comes to cracks in your plans the expertise of a realtor can make all the difference
[02:18:15.880 --> 02:18:22.280]   The difference between an agent and a realtor is real realtors are members of the national association of realtors. That's who we are
