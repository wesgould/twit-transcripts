[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:16.560]   What could they be talking about?
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:17.560]   We'll talk about watches.
[00:00:17.560 --> 00:00:19.760]   Roberts got the inside story and a whole lot more.

[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:04.160]   It's time for Twit this weekend tech
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:06.440]   to show the covers of the week's tech news.
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:09.720]   And we've got a massive panel and a good one too.
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.960]   I'm glad to have John C. de Vorek all in plan back again.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:13.960]   We missed you a little bit.
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:14.760]   Oh.
[00:02:14.760 --> 00:02:15.920]   Yeah.
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:16.840]   Well, that's unbelievable.
[00:02:16.840 --> 00:02:18.160]   I'm glad you brought some vinegar.
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.080]   Look at this shirt, huh?
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:19.560]   That's good.
[00:02:19.560 --> 00:02:20.440]   That's a Scottie vest.
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:20.960]   I recommend it.
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:22.160]   I know a genden, get one nation.
[00:02:22.160 --> 00:02:22.800]   Oh, look at that.
[00:02:22.800 --> 00:02:23.480]   All right.
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:25.680]   I love that nation.
[00:02:25.680 --> 00:02:28.080]   Wasn't it even mean, get-mo nation?
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.280]   You're in it.
[00:02:30.280 --> 00:02:32.200]   It doesn't even mean anything.
[00:02:32.200 --> 00:02:34.520]   Also with this on my left-hand side here,
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:37.560]   Mr. Robert Scobel on his third pair of Google glasses.
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.120]   Yeah.
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:40.880]   He's got the San Francisco Giants brand on those now.
[00:02:40.880 --> 00:02:41.840]   That's cool.
[00:02:41.840 --> 00:02:44.000]   What, do you break the other two?
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:44.960]   A shower.
[00:02:44.960 --> 00:02:46.240]   They're electrocuted.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.600]   One night, the mirror peeled off.
[00:02:47.600 --> 00:02:48.680]   Did Google replace those?
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:49.560]   Because it was defective.
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:49.920]   All right.
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:52.880]   So you didn't pay three times $1,500.
[00:02:52.880 --> 00:02:55.320]   Also with this, I'm very glad to have Dwight Silverman
[00:02:55.320 --> 00:03:00.680]   from the Houston Chronicle, blog.cron.com/techblog.
[00:03:00.680 --> 00:03:01.840]   Good to have you.
[00:03:01.840 --> 00:03:02.920]   Good to be back, Leo.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:03.680]   Thanks for having me.
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:05.160]   Missed you too.
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:08.040]   And somebody we haven't had on in, I think, years.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.320]   Long time.
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:10.960]   Anil Dash is here.
[00:03:10.960 --> 00:03:11.960]   Dash is.com.
[00:03:11.960 --> 00:03:12.800]   And think up.
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:15.160]   When was the last-- you've been on Twitter, right?
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:16.440]   Gosh, I feel it's been years.
[00:03:16.440 --> 00:03:17.960]   It's been years, literally.
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:20.240]   But I also feel like we stay in touch
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:22.440]   through Gina Trapani, who, of course, works for ThinkUp.
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:24.160]   And I follow you.
[00:03:24.160 --> 00:03:27.320]   And your blog, Dash, is all pretty assiduously.
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:30.160]   In fact, I wanted to get you on for three reasons.
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.840]   Of course, the big one, you announced ThinkUp.com.
[00:03:32.840 --> 00:03:35.200]   The hosted version of ThinkUp.
[00:03:35.200 --> 00:03:35.680]   Yep.
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:36.760]   Congratulations on that.
[00:03:36.760 --> 00:03:38.640]   You're doing a Kickstarter right now, right?
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:39.140]   Yeah.
[00:03:39.140 --> 00:03:40.360]   It's a crowdfunding campaign.
[00:03:40.360 --> 00:03:42.400]   It's not on Kickstarter, but it's the same kind of thing.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:43.880]   Where would we go for that?
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:45.400]   You go to ThinkUp.com.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:46.800]   Very easy.
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:49.480]   And what this really does is it gives you some capital,
[00:03:49.480 --> 00:03:53.240]   but it also allows people to sign up to have ThinkUp.
[00:03:53.240 --> 00:03:55.920]   And I was one of the backers on this ThinkUp.
[00:03:55.920 --> 00:03:56.680]   Appreciate the support.
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:59.160]   A very old-fashioned idea of charging for a product.
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.640]   You already sold out of the early bird.
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:02.920]   Yeah.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:04.200]   And so you've raised how much?
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:05.960]   783 backers.
[00:04:05.960 --> 00:04:08.320]   You hope to get 1,000 by November 15.
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:11.080]   But you'll launch-- Gina said you'll launch no matter what.
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:12.440]   Yeah, well, you can't stop us.
[00:04:12.440 --> 00:04:14.400]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:15.960]   No, we're excited.
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:17.000]   The response has been incredible.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:18.760]   I mean, we thought we would hit maybe 1,000 folks
[00:04:18.760 --> 00:04:21.080]   in a month, and here we are not even a weekend,
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.240]   and we're almost 800.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:24.040]   So that's thrilled.
[00:04:24.040 --> 00:04:27.280]   ThinkUp is a very useful analytics program.
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:28.720]   It started originally around Twitter.
[00:04:28.720 --> 00:04:30.720]   In fact, I've used it.
[00:04:30.720 --> 00:04:33.200]   And then my friend Steve Martin was saying,
[00:04:33.200 --> 00:04:34.680]   I want to do a book of my tweets.
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:37.840]   Is there any way that I keep track of them and the replies?
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:40.320]   And I was happy to get him over to Gina.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.000]   And she set him up.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:43.960]   So Steve Martin used it for his Twitter book.
[00:04:43.960 --> 00:04:46.720]   But you're adding Facebook, Instagram, Google Plus,
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:48.080]   other social networks now.
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:49.800]   Yeah, we're experimenting with all this right now.
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:53.480]   And the core thing is that it's really easy for an advertiser
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:55.480]   to get a dashboard of information about you
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:57.080]   from Facebook or Twitter.
[00:04:57.080 --> 00:04:59.360]   And it's really hard for us to get a dashboard of information
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:01.000]   about ourselves from Facebook and Twitter.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.480]   And that's kind of crazy.
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:06.120]   And so the idea is I should know at least as much about my Twitter
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:07.600]   activity as any advertiser does.
[00:05:07.600 --> 00:05:08.520]   Yeah.
[00:05:08.520 --> 00:05:09.080]   I love it.
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:10.120]   I mean, it's really fun.
[00:05:10.120 --> 00:05:12.160]   And you can know which tweets you've
[00:05:12.160 --> 00:05:14.280]   done the last week that were-- you would like this, John,
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.800]   were the most popular, got the most--
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:16.280]   They do that.
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:17.320]   I get that from Twitter.
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.080]   Oh, no, much more than the Twitter analytics.
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:20.680]   Yeah, I mean, Twitter has that basic version
[00:05:20.680 --> 00:05:22.120]   of this got a lot of retweets and favorites.
[00:05:22.120 --> 00:05:23.640]   We're going all the way to like which things you say
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:26.160]   made people happiest or in John's case, antagonize them
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:27.520]   the most or--
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:28.720]   I need this information.
[00:05:28.720 --> 00:05:29.640]   You need to know.
[00:05:29.640 --> 00:05:30.120]   Exactly.
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:30.760]   It's valuable.
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:32.960]   I've been losing my touch.
[00:05:32.960 --> 00:05:34.560]   You know, it's funny what people respond to.
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:35.760]   But it can even be like, do people
[00:05:35.760 --> 00:05:38.000]   like your new profile picture better than your old one?
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.200]   And that stuff seems silly.
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:42.480]   But that's what tons of people do every day using the networks.
[00:05:42.480 --> 00:05:44.360]   So John, we're going to keep track of everything
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:44.840]   you say today.
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:46.040]   And at the end of the show, we'll tell you
[00:05:46.040 --> 00:05:48.480]   what the most antagonistic thing was that you said.
[00:05:48.480 --> 00:05:49.160]   OK.
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.360]   OK, chat room, that's your job.
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:52.320]   They do that anyway.
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:54.720]   Crowd sourcing it, I know.
[00:05:54.720 --> 00:05:57.080]   I know.
[00:05:57.080 --> 00:05:59.160]   This is kind of one of those weird periods where you're just
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.200]   waiting for the other shoe to drop Apple.
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.280]   Send out invitations on Tuesday for an Apple event.
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:07.400]   This coming Tuesday, October 22nd.
[00:06:07.400 --> 00:06:09.320]   Of course, perfect timing because that's the day the new
[00:06:09.320 --> 00:06:11.920]   Surface 2 comes out.
[00:06:11.920 --> 00:06:13.560]   And everybody's-- it's so exciting.
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:15.520]   It's like a double header.
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:17.840]   Wow.
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:20.240]   I'm jacked up about this.
[00:06:20.240 --> 00:06:21.040]   Totally.
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:23.640]   I think if Microsoft had known, they might have delayed.
[00:06:23.640 --> 00:06:24.640]   But--
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:26.840]   Look out, Christmas.
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:29.360]   Here come the tablets.
[00:06:29.360 --> 00:06:31.040]   There is something to be said about that, though,
[00:06:31.040 --> 00:06:32.400]   because it really is.
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:33.360]   It's a tablet world.
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:36.280]   A post-PC universe tablets are doing very well.
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:39.200]   This announcement on Tuesday will probably be new iPads,
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:42.760]   probably both the big and the little one.
[00:06:42.760 --> 00:06:45.440]   I expect they'll also announce or talk about their new
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:48.560]   Mac Pro, which they've been talking a lot about since the
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:51.560]   WWDC in June.
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.480]   Anything else to--
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.000]   we don't know.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:54.800]   It's all rumors.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:56.000]   Is it worth even speculating?
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.520]   Probably not.
[00:06:57.520 --> 00:06:58.680]   Who cares?
[00:06:58.680 --> 00:06:59.800]   Meanwhile, Google can't get--
[00:06:59.800 --> 00:07:00.360]   I think the service thing's got--
[00:07:00.360 --> 00:07:01.680]   If you're going to talk about that, you should mention the
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:03.440]   8.1 failure on the RT.
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:05.360]   Well, let's talk about that.
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.480]   Actually, that is a very good topic.
[00:07:07.480 --> 00:07:08.600]   I want to--
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:08.960]   All right.
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:09.280]   Yeah.
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:09.800]   It's the first to name.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:11.120]   There's nothing more to say about Apple, right?
[00:07:11.120 --> 00:07:12.320]   That's done.
[00:07:12.320 --> 00:07:13.320]   That's the announcement.
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:15.280]   Well, plenty will be said, regardless.
[00:07:15.280 --> 00:07:17.440]   Yeah, we'll see it next week.
[00:07:17.440 --> 00:07:19.640]   Next week's show of the whole Apple all the time.
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:22.200]   Yeah, well, I feel like I look like--
[00:07:22.200 --> 00:07:26.400]   the rumor mails are, well, then the channel now, you can get--
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:28.280]   there's plenty of Apple TV, so I guess they're not going
[00:07:28.280 --> 00:07:29.120]   to announce a new one.
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:31.720]   But it's all kind of meaningless stuff.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:32.040]   Go ahead.
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:34.640]   Do I-- you have some insight you'd like to pass along you can't?
[00:07:34.640 --> 00:07:38.680]   I was just going to say, if it's all the good stuff is coming
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:40.920]   next week, can we just go away and come back next week?
[00:07:40.920 --> 00:07:42.520]   No, there's plenty of stuff to talk about.
[00:07:42.520 --> 00:07:43.280]   All right.
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:45.640]   You may not want to ask-- one thing I want to point out
[00:07:45.640 --> 00:07:50.640]   about this announcement on the 22nd is Apple has done this very
[00:07:50.640 --> 00:07:52.800]   unappled thing where they have announced a product
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.240]   and they're talking about it, but it doesn't exist yet.
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:56.920]   And that's the Mac Pro.
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:59.880]   And that's expected to be one of the things coming this week.
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:01.440]   It's made in the US.
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:03.000]   It's their first product made in the US
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   in a long time.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:04.920]   I don't know, Passau or--
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:05.520]   Is that made in Texas?
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:06.480]   It's made in Texas, all right.
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:08.360]   Yeah, made in El Paso, right?
[00:08:08.360 --> 00:08:15.200]   And probably with one of the joint Mexican US factories
[00:08:15.200 --> 00:08:16.160]   over there.
[00:08:16.160 --> 00:08:19.600]   And my suspicion is that I'm real curious as to kind of why--
[00:08:19.600 --> 00:08:22.440]   I still don't understand why they talked about it so far
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:23.960]   in advance.
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.560]   Because I could tell you why, because the pro community has
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.000]   been so pissed off with Apple that they're
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.960]   leaving in droves for Windows and Premiere and other solutions.
[00:08:33.960 --> 00:08:36.360]   And they're trying to stem the bleeding.
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:38.040]   Yeah, they haven't changed the case on this thing
[00:08:38.040 --> 00:08:39.040]   since 2010.
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:40.040]   2010.
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.040]   2003.
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:42.040]   I mean, it's been forever.
[00:08:42.040 --> 00:08:43.040]   I have it.
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:44.880]   I've the most recent Mac Pro, which was main 2010.
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:47.600]   But it's not quite the thing you just buy on a credit card.
[00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:49.600]   You have to save up a little bit for thousands.
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:50.600]   There's thousands.
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:51.600]   Right?
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:52.600]   I fully expect--
[00:08:52.600 --> 00:08:53.600]   Their system's going to be, what, $10,000?
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:08:54.600]   We don't know.
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:57.360]   They haven't said they haven't been to the provider for a long time.
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:08:58.360]   Say again, Anil?
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.880]   It's looked like a cheese grater for a long time.
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:02.560]   And now it looks like a trash can.
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:03.400]   And that's cool.
[00:09:03.400 --> 00:09:04.400]   I have one here.
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:05.320]   Yeah, he's got one here.
[00:09:05.320 --> 00:09:06.360]   He's got the prototype.
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:07.800]   Let me just go get the prototype.
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:08.800]   Here he goes.
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:09.800]   He'll be right back with it.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:10.800]   Oh, this is-- oh, sorry.
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:11.800]   I'm sorry.
[00:09:11.800 --> 00:09:12.800]   Quick sponsoring.
[00:09:12.800 --> 00:09:13.800]   There he goes.
[00:09:13.800 --> 00:09:14.800]   There it is.
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:15.800]   This is actual size.
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:20.960]   Look at the same assassins after you for having this prototype.
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:23.520]   It's got the blower in the top, but it's made out of duct tape.
[00:09:23.520 --> 00:09:24.520]   So it's not exactly--
[00:09:24.520 --> 00:09:25.520]   No, that's Gaffer's tape.
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:26.520]   I'm sorry, Gaffer's tape.
[00:09:26.520 --> 00:09:27.520]   I'm sorry.
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:30.200]   I like the little logo on the bottom.
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:34.080]   But we wanted to kind of estimate about what it would be like.
[00:09:34.080 --> 00:09:36.040]   And so you can't tell from the ads.
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:37.600]   Probably weighs more than that.
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.600]   It probably does.
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:41.160]   It's in space, but it isn't very big.
[00:09:41.160 --> 00:09:44.840]   It's small enough that you could put it on your desk like that.
[00:09:44.840 --> 00:09:49.280]   Of course, what this doesn't include is all the external peripherals and hard drives
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:50.960]   you're going to have to add to make it do anything.
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:51.960]   All Thunderbolt, right?
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:52.960]   Yeah.
[00:09:52.960 --> 00:09:53.960]   Thunderbolt 2.
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:58.840]   I don't think the pro community is all that happy with what they've seen because it's
[00:09:58.840 --> 00:10:00.800]   not very expandable from within.
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:03.480]   It all relies on these external devices.
[00:10:03.480 --> 00:10:06.800]   And I'm not necessarily sure that that's what the pro community wants.
[00:10:06.800 --> 00:10:09.640]   Well, we have 49.91 said in our chat.
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:11.160]   The pros don't care about the case.
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:12.880]   They just want the power.
[00:10:12.880 --> 00:10:13.880]   Yeah.
[00:10:13.880 --> 00:10:16.880]   I mean, every pro video editor I've ever known has 8 billion things hanging off.
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:17.880]   Yeah, no, I agree.
[00:10:17.880 --> 00:10:18.880]   Firewire.
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:20.280]   I disagree with Dwight.
[00:10:20.280 --> 00:10:21.880]   You think this is good?
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:24.360]   I think it's fine to have all this crap hanging off.
[00:10:24.360 --> 00:10:25.360]   Yeah.
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:26.360]   It's fine, man.
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:31.800]   But it's silly to promote the beautiful design if you don't have a bunch of garbage
[00:10:31.800 --> 00:10:32.800]   hanging off.
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:37.360]   Yeah, I mean, you're going to have a Drobo unit or far better array.
[00:10:37.360 --> 00:10:40.760]   You know, some sort of a bomb made bus.
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:43.800]   But you know, your old Thunderbolt will work in this, right?
[00:10:43.800 --> 00:10:44.800]   Yeah.
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.440]   I mean, the back of any professional video editor's computer looks like the Christmas
[00:10:47.440 --> 00:10:50.040]   tree lights the night you take them out of that box.
[00:10:50.040 --> 00:10:51.040]   Yeah.
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:52.040]   Some, it's like Sathulu.
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:53.040]   Thunderbolts fast.
[00:10:53.040 --> 00:10:54.040]   I must.
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:55.040]   Sathulu.
[00:10:55.040 --> 00:10:56.040]   It's going to look like Sathulu.
[00:10:56.040 --> 00:10:58.240]   That's why I got a Drobo on my system.
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:10:59.240]   That's fast.
[00:10:59.240 --> 00:11:00.240]   You know?
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:01.240]   That's nerdy.
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:02.240]   I like that.
[00:11:02.240 --> 00:11:06.120]   But it's going to cost $12,000 to buy one of these things with a range.
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:07.720]   I think you can get one cheaper than that.
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:09.480]   I think you're exaggerating the price.
[00:11:09.480 --> 00:11:12.560]   You're going to need like, I don't know, 20 gigs of ram in there and you're going to
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:14.120]   need, you know, all the hard drives.
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:15.760]   The people using this, this is their.
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:17.760]   What if you're just running Wordstar?
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.600]   Nobody runs Wordstar.
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.120]   What are you talking about?
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:22.880]   I'm from that on an Arduino board.
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:30.160]   You don't need to have a $12,000 Mac for that.
[00:11:30.160 --> 00:11:33.280]   I mean, the people that are using this thing, money is no object because it's their job.
[00:11:33.280 --> 00:11:34.280]   It's all they do, right?
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:36.280]   It's like the carpenter buys the best hammer.
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:37.960]   Yeah, it's like the Pixel Chores next door.
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:39.560]   They're probably going to buy three of them.
[00:11:39.560 --> 00:11:43.520]   We will have Alex Lindsay on the, we're going to do the live announcement thing as we usually
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:47.000]   do where we do the commentary behind the announcement at 9.30 AM.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:51.120]   Actually, Skollblick is starting to look like Philip Seymour Hoffman.
[00:11:51.120 --> 00:11:52.600]   He's always looked like Philip Seymour Hoffman.
[00:11:52.600 --> 00:11:53.600]   I think more so.
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:55.360]   More, more than before.
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:57.360]   I haven't broken bad yet.
[00:11:57.360 --> 00:11:59.360]   It kind of looked like you've broken bad.
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:00.360]   Come to think about it.
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:04.800]   Shave your head, but on a pork pie hat, who knows?
[00:12:04.800 --> 00:12:07.240]   Now see, that was completely out of nowhere.
[00:12:07.240 --> 00:12:08.240]   That was a non sequitur.
[00:12:08.240 --> 00:12:09.960]   Yeah, it was from this chat room.
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:12.080]   I gave very careful attention to these people.
[00:12:12.080 --> 00:12:14.440]   That's your mistake.
[00:12:14.440 --> 00:12:17.920]   If you don't abide by their thinking, then you're doomed.
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:19.400]   So here's my prediction.
[00:12:19.400 --> 00:12:25.520]   There will be a relatively inexpensive, and I'm going to say $24.99 version of this that
[00:12:25.520 --> 00:12:29.120]   no one will want, but that will establish the starting at price, right?
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:30.800]   Yeah, that's all that matters.
[00:12:30.800 --> 00:12:32.600]   Yeah, it's still a radio chat.
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:34.400]   Starting at $24.99.
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:37.680]   Yeah, but the one you want will be $5,000 or more.
[00:12:37.680 --> 00:12:40.480]   The one you want is fully decked out because $12,000.
[00:12:40.480 --> 00:12:42.200]   Yeah, you have not priced this out.
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:43.200]   You're just making this out.
[00:12:43.200 --> 00:12:45.680]   No, the last Mac Pro, my friend bought one.
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:49.640]   It was $12,000 when he got all the SSD and all the hard drives.
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:50.640]   It does.
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:51.640]   It's easy to do.
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:52.640]   I think you want two new Mac monitors.
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:55.320]   There will be a lot of people buying this thing for $3,000.
[00:12:55.320 --> 00:12:56.880]   There's going to be a lot of Mac phones.
[00:12:56.880 --> 00:12:57.880]   You know who's going to buy it?
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:12:58.880]   It's going to be $3,000.
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:00.240]   I'm going to buy it for the cheapest price.
[00:13:00.240 --> 00:13:03.520]   I'm hoping the $24.99 will have 128 gigs of storage.
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:04.960]   It'll have 8 gigs of RAM.
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.400]   It won't be like or even 4 gigs of RAM.
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:09.120]   It'll be the simplest, dumbest one.
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:14.640]   In fact, by the way, notice if you go to buy a Mac Pro today, quad core $24.99.
[00:13:14.640 --> 00:13:21.320]   Again, starting at, but it's not hard to get to $12, core $37.99 and then start to add
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:22.320]   features.
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:25.280]   Well, you know, let's have a little bit faster processor.
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:28.200]   Let's get to a 64 gigs of RAM.
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:30.720]   Let's put in a solid state drive.
[00:13:30.720 --> 00:13:33.640]   Let's put in a two terabyte second drive, third drive.
[00:13:33.640 --> 00:13:35.440]   You don't have to get up to 10 grand.
[00:13:35.440 --> 00:13:37.440]   I'm up to 94.9249 already.
[00:13:37.440 --> 00:13:40.160]   You're adding drive after a crazy drive.
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:42.520]   All right, I'll take out those extra drives.
[00:13:42.520 --> 00:13:46.440]   Okay, one solid state and one spin.
[00:13:46.440 --> 00:13:47.440]   Don't they have new 4K?
[00:13:47.440 --> 00:13:48.440]   Okay.
[00:13:48.440 --> 00:13:49.440]   Yeah, she wants.
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:50.440]   Okay.
[00:13:50.440 --> 00:13:51.440]   And then so I won't fill up.
[00:13:51.440 --> 00:13:52.940]   Now, graphics do I want.
[00:13:52.940 --> 00:13:54.280]   You don't want the 5770.
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:13:55.280]   You want the 5870.
[00:13:55.280 --> 00:13:56.280]   Why?
[00:13:56.280 --> 00:13:57.280]   Can you ask a test look?
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:58.280]   100, better.
[00:13:58.280 --> 00:13:59.280]   We'll just get a test look.
[00:13:59.280 --> 00:14:00.280]   100, better.
[00:14:00.280 --> 00:14:02.000]   Do you want one or two super drives?
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   I'll go with one.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   This doesn't include display.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   Let's add the Apple display.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.920]   Don't they have two 4K displays coming out for the same?
[00:14:08.920 --> 00:14:09.920]   Well, and I think they will.
[00:14:09.920 --> 00:14:11.160]   And those will be very expensive.
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:12.160]   I do think they will.
[00:14:12.160 --> 00:14:13.160]   They've talked about 4K.
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:16.120]   4K is not that much more expensive than the regular stuff now.
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:18.560]   No, but it's still even if it was the same price as the old monitor.
[00:14:18.560 --> 00:14:19.560]   If it's Apple, it's $1 each.
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:20.560]   Well, I'm sorry.
[00:14:20.560 --> 00:14:21.560]   It's Apple.
[00:14:21.560 --> 00:14:22.560]   It's more expensive.
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:23.560]   Yes, it would.
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:25.400]   And the same amount of display is going to be what?
[00:14:25.400 --> 00:14:30.360]   It's $1,000 for the regular, say $2,500, $2,999.
[00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:31.360]   $3,298.
[00:14:31.360 --> 00:14:36.080]   I just, I mean, it's going to be 12 grand by the time you get taken.
[00:14:36.080 --> 00:14:39.000]   I will buy this as a home theater PC.
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:40.480]   Well, why?
[00:14:40.480 --> 00:14:41.480]   That's nuts.
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:42.840]   It'll look great in my living room.
[00:14:42.840 --> 00:14:43.840]   They don't make a racket.
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:44.840]   I wouldn't know.
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:45.840]   They're going to have fans.
[00:14:45.840 --> 00:14:48.200]   No, no, that's part of it.
[00:14:48.200 --> 00:14:49.200]   I'm telling you, I--
[00:14:49.200 --> 00:14:51.640]   This is Gaffers tape you're showing us.
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:54.600]   But notice the fan.
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.000]   It's got one fan.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:58.560]   It's got the cooling core.
[00:14:58.560 --> 00:14:59.560]   It's hollow.
[00:14:59.560 --> 00:15:01.640]   What are you laughing at?
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:03.600]   This is an exact reading.
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:04.600]   I'm going to gafferate.
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:06.040]   The cool fan is hollow.
[00:15:06.040 --> 00:15:08.840]   One fan draws the heat up through the claymore.
[00:15:08.840 --> 00:15:09.840]   It makes noise.
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:10.840]   No, no, no.
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:13.680]   It's a big-- so you know the bigger the blades in the way it is.
[00:15:13.680 --> 00:15:14.680]   Yeah, we'll do this, yeah.
[00:15:14.680 --> 00:15:15.680]   So it can rotate slower.
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:18.200]   I suspect this would be a very quiet machine.
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:19.480]   It's a perfect home theater PC.
[00:15:19.480 --> 00:15:24.240]   Leo, it was so sad all these years in broadcasting, and you're reduced to being a prop comic now.
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.240]   Like that.
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:26.240]   Just take the seat down.
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:27.240]   On the Gallagher of Tech.
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:29.400]   Yeah, that's really-- it's a shame to see you.
[00:15:29.400 --> 00:15:31.200]   It could be the watermelon.
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:34.600]   Or as-- who was it said, the carrot top of the--
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:35.600]   Oh, dear.
[00:15:35.600 --> 00:15:36.600]   Evangelists.
[00:15:36.600 --> 00:15:37.600]   The Costolo.
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:38.600]   The Costolo.
[00:15:38.600 --> 00:15:39.600]   We could talk about that.
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:44.880]   You've been involved in-- besides think up, Anil Dash has been involved in two major stories
[00:15:44.880 --> 00:15:48.680]   of the last few months, and we wanted to get you on to talk about that as well.
[00:15:48.680 --> 00:15:51.480]   The Pa-- Paxticket's in Threaten to Beat You Up, so that's good.
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:52.480]   I saw him yesterday.
[00:15:52.480 --> 00:15:53.480]   We'll talk about that.
[00:15:53.480 --> 00:15:57.800]   And Dick Costolo, the CEO of Twitter, you got a little back and forth over the fact that
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:16:00.960]   there is no-- there are no women at the top of Twitter.
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:01.960]   There's no women on the board.
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:04.800]   That wasn't really what I talked to him about, but there was a conversation about that.
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:05.800]   Sure.
[00:16:05.800 --> 00:16:06.800]   Well, I'd like to hear both of those.
[00:16:06.800 --> 00:16:07.800]   Sure.
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:12.040]   And thank you for defending whoever you're defending.
[00:16:12.040 --> 00:16:15.040]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:16.600]   I think I'm happy to do so.
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:17.600]   The disenfranchised.
[00:16:17.600 --> 00:16:19.600]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:21.120]   Somebody's got to do it.
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:22.120]   Yeah.
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:23.120]   Yeah, I mean, you know, it's a tweet.
[00:16:23.120 --> 00:16:24.920]   It's literally the least I could do.
[00:16:24.920 --> 00:16:25.920]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:29.320]   You know, like it's not like a hard song watching.
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:30.320]   It's harder right short.
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:33.360]   I mean, you know, that's not just you suck.
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:34.360]   The least.
[00:16:34.360 --> 00:16:36.600]   The least I could do.
[00:16:36.600 --> 00:16:37.600]   Literally.
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:38.600]   Let's take a break.
[00:16:38.600 --> 00:16:39.600]   We're going to come back one more.
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:42.680]   Anil Dash is here from dashes.com and think up.com.
[00:16:42.680 --> 00:16:52.480]   Robert Scobel, the scobelizer from Rackspace.
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:54.360]   Still writing for the newspaper?
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:57.040]   Actually, I do very little stuff for print.
[00:16:57.040 --> 00:17:02.800]   Almost everything is in the blog and I'm running our social media initiatives out of
[00:17:02.800 --> 00:17:03.800]   the newsroom.
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:05.280]   You talked about the last time you were here.
[00:17:05.280 --> 00:17:06.280]   Is that working?
[00:17:06.280 --> 00:17:07.280]   Yeah.
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:08.280]   Yeah, it's enjoyable.
[00:17:08.280 --> 00:17:09.280]   It's a real challenge.
[00:17:09.280 --> 00:17:10.840]   We have gotten.
[00:17:10.840 --> 00:17:16.520]   We can safely say we've now got every reporter on Twitter and so we're using it much more
[00:17:16.520 --> 00:17:20.440]   aggressively than we had in the past and we were already using it pretty aggressively.
[00:17:20.440 --> 00:17:26.960]   You know, I was just reading about the budget for healthcare.gov, the Affordable Health
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:32.160]   Care Acts Exchange, the Church Exchange site, which the government got a Canadian company,
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:37.040]   CGI, federal, to build the original budget for that.
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:40.800]   If you thought your website was expensive, the original budget for that, you know, is
[00:17:40.800 --> 00:17:41.800]   for that was $92 million.
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.280]   You know what I don't get?
[00:17:44.280 --> 00:17:47.520]   It's over $200 million the final cost.
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:49.520]   Why didn't they just use Squarespace?
[00:17:49.520 --> 00:17:50.520]   That was mine!
[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:55.840]   That was exactly $24 a month and they could have had e-commerce too.
[00:17:55.840 --> 00:17:56.840]   Exactly.
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:58.600]   And it would have worked better.
[00:17:58.600 --> 00:17:59.600]   And it wouldn't be down.
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:00.800]   I can tell you that right now.
[00:18:00.800 --> 00:18:04.880]   You, even if a million people's tried to sign up at Squarespace.com, you can't bring a
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:06.280]   Squarespace site down.
[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:09.160]   You know, I could have saved the government a lot of money.
[00:18:09.160 --> 00:18:10.160]   A lot of money.
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:11.400]   I'm going to save you a lot of money.
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:15.320]   We had a caller today on the radio show say, "I spent a lot of money on my..."
[00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:16.320]   The radio show.
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:17.320]   I do a radio show.
[00:18:17.320 --> 00:18:18.320]   Do you know that?
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:19.320]   When did that start?
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:20.320]   The start guy show.
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:21.320]   In 1992 with you.
[00:18:21.320 --> 00:18:23.120]   They still have radios.
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:24.120]   Remember?
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:27.240]   You and I, we remember that, but I don't remember you doing a new show.
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:28.240]   You never stopped.
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:29.240]   Oh.
[00:18:29.240 --> 00:18:30.240]   I never stopped the tech guy show.
[00:18:30.240 --> 00:18:32.200]   You can't listen to it on KGL anymore.
[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:34.040]   They moved it to KSF.
[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:35.840]   It's at 910 a.m. on Sunday afternoons.
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.520]   I'm sure John listens on the way up.
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:40.120]   I can't get it anymore.
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:41.120]   Really?
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:42.960]   You know, they pulled it off of XM this weekend.
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:47.680]   XM had lost all the Clear Channel stations off the America's Talking Station.
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:48.880]   Well, what do you think that was?
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:50.040]   Oh, that's a good story.
[00:18:50.040 --> 00:18:51.040]   And I'll tell you that as soon as Squarespace.
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:53.080]   We'll do it when we get back to the show.
[00:18:53.080 --> 00:18:54.080]   Yeah.
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:18:56.600]   But so this guy called up and he said, "You know, I spent a lot of money on a website
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:59.400]   and the developer has absconded.
[00:18:59.400 --> 00:19:02.240]   I don't know who I don't have any.
[00:19:02.240 --> 00:19:03.240]   I don't know who did the name."
[00:19:03.240 --> 00:19:04.680]   Is this the government you're talking about?
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:06.640]   No, it could have been though.
[00:19:06.640 --> 00:19:07.920]   I don't know where it's hosted.
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:09.760]   I've lost the keys to the kingdom.
[00:19:09.760 --> 00:19:13.400]   And this happens all the time because people don't know when they want to do a website.
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:17.360]   They go and they get a contractor and they don't realize the contractor has got the domain
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:19.120]   name in their name.
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:21.520]   They've got the hosting in their name.
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:25.240]   And if they leave or they move to Aruba, you're out of luck.
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:26.240]   That's dumb.
[00:19:26.240 --> 00:19:27.240]   Squarespace.
[00:19:27.240 --> 00:19:28.240]   You've got a complete control of it all.
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:30.560]   They will register domain name for you.
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:32.520]   So it's all set up.
[00:19:32.520 --> 00:19:35.240]   When you buy the annual plan, they'll do that for free.
[00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:36.960]   And you'll get the greatest hosting in the world.
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:40.000]   It never goes down, attached to the best content management system.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.120]   And that's I think one of the reasons the hosting works so well.
[00:19:42.120 --> 00:19:45.040]   You know, the no agenda show uses Squarespace as its website.
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.040]   Do you send people...
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:48.440]   What has ever had a stoppage?
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:49.440]   Yeah.
[00:19:49.440 --> 00:19:54.000]   So you send people there during the show, which means probably thousands hit it simultaneously.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:55.520]   And it never goes down.
[00:19:55.520 --> 00:19:57.200]   No, no, never goes down.
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:58.200]   There it is.
[00:19:58.200 --> 00:19:59.200]   This is where you can listen to the show.
[00:19:59.200 --> 00:20:01.960]   Oh, that's the latest one I got to have to post on my blog.
[00:20:01.960 --> 00:20:03.920]   Takes no time.
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:08.240]   You could have maybe made it a little prettier, but that's okay.
[00:20:08.240 --> 00:20:09.240]   Well, this is...
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:10.240]   Yeah.
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:11.240]   You wouldn't match John's brand.
[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:12.240]   You wouldn't.
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:15.240]   You have a simple brand, a clean, simple brand.
[00:20:15.240 --> 00:20:16.240]   It's the minimalism.
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:17.240]   It's the plan.
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:18.240]   It's the plan.
[00:20:18.240 --> 00:20:19.240]   It's the plan.
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:20.240]   It's the plan.
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:22.560]   A little hipster, a little minimalism, all built in one.
[00:20:22.560 --> 00:20:23.560]   You know, you get your choice.
[00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:26.000]   If you go to squarespace.com, click the Get Started button.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:27.200]   You don't need to give them a credit card.
[00:20:27.200 --> 00:20:29.320]   You can, two weeks, create your own site.
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:31.040]   You're going to pick a template.
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:32.960]   They have new templates coming in all the time.
[00:20:32.960 --> 00:20:34.720]   Great designers working at Squarespace.
[00:20:34.720 --> 00:20:36.720]   One thing, all the templates share, though.
[00:20:36.720 --> 00:20:37.960]   They're all mobile responsive.
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:41.640]   That means your site will look great no matter how big or small the screen is.
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:44.200]   Very modern and very important to do that.
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:45.880]   They also support commerce.
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:47.760]   All of their sites can be...
[00:20:47.760 --> 00:20:49.680]   You can add the commerce capability.
[00:20:49.680 --> 00:20:52.360]   If you want to sell stuff, you can.
[00:20:52.360 --> 00:20:57.600]   They've won numerous design awards from the FWA, the Webby's Forbes Awards.
[00:20:57.600 --> 00:21:05.200]   They've also got just incredible, simple, easy to use, point and click, drag and drop interfaces.
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:08.720]   But if you're a developer, you can also use CSS and JavaScript.
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:12.000]   They've got a great developer platform as well.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:13.720]   Let the girls play outside.
[00:21:13.720 --> 00:21:15.440]   I love this.
[00:21:15.440 --> 00:21:17.400]   This is wildlife portraiture.
[00:21:17.400 --> 00:21:20.800]   It's fun to visit the various websites created on squarespace.com.
[00:21:20.800 --> 00:21:24.240]   One thing you'll notice immediately is they all look unique.
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:25.960]   You don't look like you've done a...
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:26.960]   We'll except for that one.
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:28.960]   You don't look...
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:32.080]   You don't look default templates.
[00:21:32.080 --> 00:21:33.680]   You didn't change it at all.
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:34.680]   We like it.
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:35.680]   Yeah, why change it?
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:36.680]   It's got a look.
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:37.680]   It's got a thing.
[00:21:37.680 --> 00:21:38.920]   It works for us.
[00:21:38.920 --> 00:21:39.920]   You don't have to change.
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:40.920]   It's a podcast.
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:42.240]   You don't need to website it.
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:43.360]   That's what I keep telling people.
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:46.360]   It's just a podcast for crying out loud.
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:47.640]   The price is right, too.
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:49.800]   Start at $8 a month when you get an annual plan.
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:54.160]   But I think you're going to want either the unlimited plan, $16 a month with unlimited
[00:21:54.160 --> 00:21:56.520]   pages, galleries, blogs, unlimited bandwidth.
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:57.720]   You'll never get a bandwidth.
[00:21:57.720 --> 00:22:00.040]   Bill unlimited storage, unlimited contributors.
[00:22:00.040 --> 00:22:01.720]   $24 a month.
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:05.040]   You also get commerce, unlimited physical and/or digital products.
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:09.680]   So you can sell CDs and MP3s, books and ebooks, that kind of thing.
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:16.680]   The mobile store will give you inventory tracking, the tax calculation, shipping.
[00:22:16.680 --> 00:22:17.920]   They'll do coupons if you want.
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:21.280]   I mean, it really is the best commerce solution.
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:23.360]   Plus it's global.
[00:22:23.360 --> 00:22:25.880]   Your online store is available in 10 countries.
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:31.320]   US, UK, Canada, Australia, Belgium, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands and Spain,
[00:22:31.320 --> 00:22:33.880]   they're adding more all the time.
[00:22:33.880 --> 00:22:34.880]   Free to try.
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:37.960]   Two weeks free if you decide you want to buy, do use our offer code TWIT and the number
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:42.160]   10 that you get 10% off and show your support for this week in tax.
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:49.880]   Offer code TWIT10 when you decide to buy for 10% off your new account, Squarespace.com.
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:51.920]   I see a lot of bullet points in that last ad.
[00:22:51.920 --> 00:22:53.160]   I don't even read the bullet points.
[00:22:53.160 --> 00:22:55.480]   Yeah, you actually read those bullet points.
[00:22:55.480 --> 00:22:59.160]   I just kind of, I consider them a serving suggestion.
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:02.560]   I can put a little spring up parsley on there and I'm done.
[00:23:02.560 --> 00:23:05.520]   See, I didn't mention that they want a gold Stevie award.
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:06.520]   I left that one.
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:07.520]   I don't know Stevie.
[00:23:07.520 --> 00:23:08.520]   I don't either.
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:10.520]   I'm sure it's good.
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:12.520]   That's for service.
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:13.520]   All right.
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:14.520]   All right.
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:17.520]   Well, let's say this one.
[00:23:17.520 --> 00:23:18.520]   Windows 8.1.
[00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:19.520]   Oh, yeah.
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:20.520]   That's a good one.
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.520]   I'm going to check out this week.
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:28.640]   It was a fairly easy update if you were using Windows 8 Professional.
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:29.640]   No problem at all.
[00:23:29.640 --> 00:23:32.280]   Our friend Tom Merritt runs TNT.
[00:23:32.280 --> 00:23:33.280]   He had the misfortune.
[00:23:33.280 --> 00:23:34.520]   He had a Windows RT tablet.
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:36.600]   Yeah, this is where the real problem began.
[00:23:36.600 --> 00:23:37.600]   Fricked it.
[00:23:37.600 --> 00:23:38.600]   Yeah.
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:39.600]   I know it's hilarious.
[00:23:39.600 --> 00:23:40.600]   So that's strange.
[00:23:40.600 --> 00:23:43.000]   I have, I'm the user of a Surface RT.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.080]   I'm the guy who bought one.
[00:23:44.080 --> 00:23:45.320]   Did you upgrade?
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:48.120]   And, and I did, but I upgraded a while.
[00:23:48.120 --> 00:23:49.120]   I think they had a developer one.
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:50.120]   Oh, you did the preview.
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:52.120]   And I had, yeah, and I had no problems.
[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:54.400]   But you haven't done the new one.
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:55.400]   I think I have.
[00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:56.400]   I think I haven't.
[00:23:56.400 --> 00:23:57.400]   I had no problems.
[00:23:57.400 --> 00:24:01.280]   Well, maybe there was a process involved here by doing the first one and then upgrading
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:02.280]   one more time.
[00:24:02.280 --> 00:24:03.280]   It could be.
[00:24:03.280 --> 00:24:04.280]   Yeah.
[00:24:04.280 --> 00:24:05.280]   Can this happen?
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:06.280]   Maybe that solved it.
[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:08.280]   But I feel like it's actually a pretty good product.
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:10.000]   Well, which is kind of weird.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.680]   I wouldn't go that far, but it's a big improvement.
[00:24:12.680 --> 00:24:14.600]   It's a big improvement over Windows 8.
[00:24:14.600 --> 00:24:20.080]   Well, it goes a lot of ways of fixing a lot of the things that, that every day I use
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:23.200]   users complained about, but it kind of doesn't go far enough.
[00:24:23.200 --> 00:24:26.200]   There are little things in it that make it a lot easier.
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:29.520]   When people would complain to me that they didn't like Windows 8, they couldn't find
[00:24:29.520 --> 00:24:30.520]   their programs.
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:35.520]   You know, I would tell them to use the search box and that brings up that kind of wide field
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:36.520]   of apps.
[00:24:36.520 --> 00:24:38.920]   So you can see all your apps like the program groups.
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:43.840]   And they've put that in there with that little arrow down at the bottom of the live tile,
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:45.080]   the live tile field.
[00:24:45.080 --> 00:24:47.000]   And that gives you, lets you see everything.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:51.240]   So if you kind of take somebody who doesn't like Windows 8 and show them Windows 8.1 and
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:54.760]   walk them through it, I've done this with a few folks, they tend to like it better.
[00:24:54.760 --> 00:25:00.120]   But there's still that annoying, that start screen just really is irritating to people.
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:02.720]   It makes them feel like they can't find their stuff.
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:04.720]   And I like David Pogue's review where he's still playing.
[00:25:04.720 --> 00:25:05.720]   I thought he was right on.
[00:25:05.720 --> 00:25:06.960]   I think he nailed it.
[00:25:06.960 --> 00:25:08.320]   Yes, he did.
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:10.280]   What did Pogue say?
[00:25:10.280 --> 00:25:12.280]   He said there's two worlds.
[00:25:12.280 --> 00:25:15.840]   There's tile world and there's desktop world.
[00:25:15.840 --> 00:25:19.320]   And the two just aren't really, don't mesh that well.
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:25.880]   Microsoft did one interesting thing where they finally allowed you to have the same wallpaper
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:28.280]   for the tile background as the desktop.
[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:29.600]   And that actually does seem good with the dark.
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:31.200]   But find that setting, I cannot find that setting.
[00:25:31.200 --> 00:25:32.200]   I've been searching.
[00:25:32.200 --> 00:25:33.720]   It really does unify the experience.
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:37.160]   But I tell you, my experience is a little different.
[00:25:37.160 --> 00:25:38.360]   I was always a Windows guy.
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:42.360]   I never had an Apple computer ever until a couple of years ago, a company I was at,
[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:44.840]   they were like, we don't have a Windows laptop handy, we're going to give you a Mac.
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:45.840]   And I said, I'll try it.
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:47.960]   And so I've been Mac ever since.
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:52.120]   And that was the Windows XP days and it was a pain in the butt to manage the computer.
[00:25:52.120 --> 00:25:54.400]   But I kept an eye on Windows.
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:58.520]   And then I got this Surface RT, Windows 8, and the first time I played with it with
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:00.360]   Windows in years.
[00:26:00.360 --> 00:26:06.400]   And what they call tile world and Pogue's framing of this thing, that's all I use.
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:07.400]   I've got a bunch of apps.
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:08.720]   They're all native to Windows.
[00:26:08.720 --> 00:26:09.800]   I use it every day.
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:11.840]   Now, my main machine is still my Mac.
[00:26:11.840 --> 00:26:13.800]   But I go in there and I fire up Skype.
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:15.040]   I set up a couple of tiles.
[00:26:15.040 --> 00:26:19.200]   Next to it is my chat or whatever I'm doing or a browser open, whatever we're talking
[00:26:19.200 --> 00:26:20.640]   about in Skype.
[00:26:20.640 --> 00:26:21.640]   And I got the next each other.
[00:26:21.640 --> 00:26:23.640]   It's the best Skype on any platform.
[00:26:23.640 --> 00:26:26.520]   It's the best Netflix on any platform.
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:27.520]   It looks really nice.
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:28.520]   It works great.
[00:26:28.520 --> 00:26:30.760]   And I'm kind of like, maybe I'm crazy.
[00:26:30.760 --> 00:26:33.000]   Maybe I'm like the only person that really gets this thing.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   But I'm like, every once in a while, I can drop into office if somebody sent me a word,
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.720]   doc, but that's how often does that even happen anymore.
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:45.760]   But for the things that I'm doing every day, I use Trello that sort of list making app
[00:26:45.760 --> 00:26:47.120]   to do app kind of thing.
[00:26:47.120 --> 00:26:48.120]   Dan Bricklin.
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:49.120]   Yeah.
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:50.120]   Yeah.
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:51.120]   It's Joe Spolsky.
[00:26:51.120 --> 00:26:52.120]   Joe Spolsky.
[00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:53.120]   That's right.
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:54.120]   Yeah.
[00:26:54.120 --> 00:26:55.120]   And that's a great app.
[00:26:55.120 --> 00:26:56.120]   And they're all really good apps.
[00:26:56.120 --> 00:26:59.520]   And I feel like, hey, and I can have two of them up at a time, which I can't do on
[00:26:59.520 --> 00:27:01.280]   my iPad.
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:04.160]   I can copy and paste real easily to all those kinds of things I would do.
[00:27:04.160 --> 00:27:06.960]   And I'm like, this is pretty good.
[00:27:06.960 --> 00:27:09.360]   So maybe I'm just the guy they designed it for.
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:10.360]   Yeah.
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:13.440]   Well, your description sounds like the taste of an old lady.
[00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:15.880]   A lot of kind of minor apps.
[00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:16.880]   Look at that.
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:17.880]   She's pretty good.
[00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:19.880]   Hey, I'm coming back up the aisle.
[00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:21.720]   I'm playing with Windows 8.
[00:27:21.720 --> 00:27:25.320]   I was just up at Microsoft and saw the new stuff.
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:26.320]   It's not that bad.
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:27.320]   Not that bad.
[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.720]   It's not a sterling and not that bad.
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:32.640]   It's not a very wimpy kind of thing to say.
[00:27:32.640 --> 00:27:37.760]   What Paul has said, and I think he's right on, and I'll extend a little bit what he said,
[00:27:37.760 --> 00:27:42.680]   is that I believe this is an adolescent software program that Microsoft is in between two stages
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:43.680]   of growth.
[00:27:43.680 --> 00:27:44.680]   Right.
[00:27:44.680 --> 00:27:46.680]   They're going from the desktop to stages of death.
[00:27:46.680 --> 00:27:49.600]   Going from the desktop world to the tablet world, they've acknowledged that we're in a
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:51.000]   post PC universe.
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.680]   They understand we need to be a tablet operating since, in fact, Mary Jo Foley says her source
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:28:00.120]   is at Microsoft, says the next version of Windows, which won't be out till spring 2015
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:04.000]   is going to be based on get this Windows phone.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:05.640]   This is where Microsoft's going.
[00:28:05.640 --> 00:28:10.600]   And so when you use Windows 8, you're using an adolescent product that's halfway grown.
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:12.520]   It's half between desktop and half between tablet.
[00:28:12.520 --> 00:28:14.960]   So real problem I have is nothing is nothing.
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:17.400]   And I'll said I was at startup school.
[00:28:17.400 --> 00:28:18.400]   Why common error?
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:19.400]   It was 1600 entrepreneurs.
[00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:20.400]   That sounds like fun.
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:21.800]   That was yesterday.
[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:23.880]   I didn't see a single Windows box there.
[00:28:23.880 --> 00:28:27.160]   And these are the kids who are building the companies that are bringing the books to the
[00:28:27.160 --> 00:28:28.160]   market.
[00:28:28.160 --> 00:28:31.560]   And so if you are betting on the Windows, what did they have?
[00:28:31.560 --> 00:28:32.560]   Max and I saw.
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:33.560]   Max.
[00:28:33.560 --> 00:28:34.560]   Max.
[00:28:34.560 --> 00:28:35.560]   Yeah.
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:37.080]   Androids everywhere.
[00:28:37.080 --> 00:28:39.200]   These kids are totally into the mobile phones.
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:41.280]   That's where they're developing the cool stuff.
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:42.880]   iPhone or Android, right?
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:44.560]   And I have no argument there.
[00:28:44.560 --> 00:28:47.160]   You're going to go to any of these events where people are making something innovative
[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:48.160]   and interesting.
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:49.160]   And not just in tech.
[00:28:49.160 --> 00:28:52.680]   If you go to a conference of lawyers, you go to a conference of librarians, they've
[00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:57.960]   got Mac books and the people that have Windows laptops feel like the people you talk to that
[00:28:57.960 --> 00:28:58.960]   still have a blackberry.
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:00.960]   Well, work gave it to me.
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:01.960]   Yeah.
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:02.960]   Yeah.
[00:29:02.960 --> 00:29:03.960]   I agree with that.
[00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:06.760]   But the business, if you go to any office, it's Windows everywhere.
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:08.400]   Even on office, it's Windows everywhere.
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:09.400]   That's what people use.
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:13.360]   And this is Microsoft's problem is that there are all these people who are using Excel in
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:14.360]   the desktop.
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:16.160]   They can't abandon the Microsoft.
[00:29:16.160 --> 00:29:19.720]   Historically, it's always had so much trouble leaving legacy behind.
[00:29:19.720 --> 00:29:24.840]   Well, they really apparently have decided that the world is post PC and they don't want
[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:26.160]   to be in the PC business.
[00:29:26.160 --> 00:29:27.160]   They even call themselves.
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:28.160]   Why don't they just shoot themselves?
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:30.880]   They call themselves a devices and services company.
[00:29:30.880 --> 00:29:33.160]   This reorganization is along those lines.
[00:29:33.160 --> 00:29:38.360]   They bought Nokia because they want to sell surface and phones.
[00:29:38.360 --> 00:29:40.560]   Because how many phones are selling this year?
[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:46.400]   900 million smart phones and 4 to 10% are Windows phones.
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:48.360]   And Microsoft does not like that number.
[00:29:48.360 --> 00:29:49.360]   Right.
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:52.920]   I think Microsoft is doing well in legacy.
[00:29:52.920 --> 00:29:53.920]   Leo's right.
[00:29:53.920 --> 00:29:56.000]   You go into any business in America.
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:30:01.240]   You go to America and everybody's still using Windows, but there's no growth there.
[00:30:01.240 --> 00:30:04.800]   Microsoft as a public company has to go where the growth is.
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:06.160]   And so this is their shot at it.
[00:30:06.160 --> 00:30:10.200]   The problem is they're not doing well in the areas that are growing heavily.
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:11.680]   They're not doing well in tablets.
[00:30:11.680 --> 00:30:14.080]   They're not doing well in phones.
[00:30:14.080 --> 00:30:18.520]   And so Microsoft is they have to serve legacy because that's where their current cash cow
[00:30:18.520 --> 00:30:19.520]   is.
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:21.120]   It's very similar to the newspaper business.
[00:30:21.120 --> 00:30:22.120]   They have to serve.
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:24.120]   By the way, you can't kill the old.
[00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:28.880]   Dwight, I don't know if you or Mary Jo have picked up on this, but there is a huge brain
[00:30:28.880 --> 00:30:34.320]   drain going on at Microsoft and I am getting so many people begging me for jobs.
[00:30:34.320 --> 00:30:36.600]   Why do they beg in you because they're desperate.
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:40.240]   They're want out right now and they're begging you.
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:42.520]   You are you hiring Robert Scoble.
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:43.520]   Are you hiring?
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:45.280]   Has 5,000 employees.
[00:30:45.280 --> 00:30:49.840]   They're begging everybody, man.
[00:30:49.840 --> 00:30:50.840]   They're not just begging me.
[00:30:50.840 --> 00:30:51.840]   They're begging everybody.
[00:30:51.840 --> 00:30:56.480]   You know, so I mean, Jeff Sanquist, who was the company man is at Twitter now, right?
[00:30:56.480 --> 00:30:57.480]   Yeah.
[00:30:57.480 --> 00:30:58.480]   So Robert, why do they want to?
[00:30:58.480 --> 00:31:02.760]   Because it really is in disarray up there and it's not a fun place to work out right
[00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:03.760]   now.
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:06.760]   It's not a place where innovators want to be.
[00:31:06.760 --> 00:31:08.760]   Well, in any transition, right?
[00:31:08.760 --> 00:31:12.360]   They're changing leadership all the way around at the top, you know, obviously getting
[00:31:12.360 --> 00:31:15.960]   her in the CEO, obviously changing the organization, the company, any of that kind of stuff shakes
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.280]   out anybody who's loose.
[00:31:17.280 --> 00:31:22.000]   It's worse than that because all the, like you said, all the cool kids in the world are
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.680]   not using Windows boxes.
[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:30.640]   And they know the world is moving somewhere else and people who care about their future
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:33.960]   careers don't want to be where there's no movement.
[00:31:33.960 --> 00:31:34.960]   Yeah.
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:36.480]   And where's the only cool thing they've done Xbox?
[00:31:36.480 --> 00:31:39.480]   I think consoles as a whole are getting displaced by tablets and phones.
[00:31:39.480 --> 00:31:40.480]   Yeah.
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:41.480]   So that's a bad thing.
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:45.040]   So my advice to people is you don't want to be caught in this kind of in-between world.
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:46.840]   You should stick with Windows 7 unless you have to buy.
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:51.440]   If you're going to buy a new computer, you have to get Windows 8 and Classic Shell is
[00:31:51.440 --> 00:31:53.000]   a great combination that works.
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   It still feels like one.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   I know.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   So it depends who you are, right?
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.240]   If you're that guy who only uses Excel every day, Windows 8 is great.
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:00.520]   We're all old timers, right?
[00:32:00.520 --> 00:32:05.720]   How does this compare to the transition from Classic OS, Mac OS to OS 10?
[00:32:05.720 --> 00:32:08.520]   I feel like it's better integrated in Windows 8 than Mac OS.
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:09.520]   Oh, I disagree.
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:10.520]   Nobody bitched about the change to OS 10.
[00:32:10.520 --> 00:32:13.320]   Well, first of all, back then, nobody was using a Mac except for Leo.
[00:32:13.320 --> 00:32:18.120]   And believe me, OS 10 was such an improvement over Classic OS.
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:19.280]   But Apple did the right thing.
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:20.280]   They had a Classic Shell.
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:21.280]   Yeah.
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:22.280]   You were able to run Classic software.
[00:32:22.280 --> 00:32:24.280]   And they made it, they didn't.
[00:32:24.280 --> 00:32:25.280]   They didn't.
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:28.200]   Apple's always been good at cutting off the old and moving on.
[00:32:28.200 --> 00:32:32.080]   It also didn't change the look of the OS all that much.
[00:32:32.080 --> 00:32:36.800]   I mean, you still had the same menu bar with the same Apple bar, the same app switcher.
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:37.960]   The blue box.
[00:32:37.960 --> 00:32:39.520]   Aqua was a big change.
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:40.520]   OS 10 was a big change.
[00:32:40.520 --> 00:32:43.520]   It was a big change, but it wasn't that big a change in UI.
[00:32:43.520 --> 00:32:45.960]   Windows 8 is a dramatic change on the UI.
[00:32:45.960 --> 00:32:49.160]   The first thing you see does not look anything like Windows 7.
[00:32:49.160 --> 00:32:53.840]   Well, and we have to mention the idiotic full screen apps, even though now you can spread
[00:32:53.840 --> 00:32:54.840]   them up a little bit.
[00:32:54.840 --> 00:32:56.000]   Except that's the future.
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   That's ridiculous.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:00.400]   If you have a big monitor, you got a big app that's this big.
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:01.400]   You don't need it that big.
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:04.520]   You might have a feeling is nobody's going to have big monitors anymore.
[00:33:04.520 --> 00:33:07.160]   You know where this ring is coming from now?
[00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:09.320]   When I worked at Microsoft, I worked the support line.
[00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:15.120]   And I had to help a lady drag an icon across the screen for half an hour.
[00:33:15.120 --> 00:33:16.120]   That's who uses this.
[00:33:16.120 --> 00:33:18.240]   Sure, she wasn't up to something.
[00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:19.480]   I don't know, man.
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:23.200]   It's really hard to help normal people use a computer.
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:26.800]   You know, we in this room all forget that we are so advanced.
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:28.800]   It's not that hard.
[00:33:28.800 --> 00:33:29.800]   It's really hard.
[00:33:29.800 --> 00:33:30.800]   12 year olds can do it.
[00:33:30.800 --> 00:33:31.800]   No, it's really hard.
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:34.800]   You guys can be part of this.
[00:33:34.800 --> 00:33:40.880]   This is why I have a computer scene and oh God, the DOS prompt is so complicated.
[00:33:40.880 --> 00:33:42.880]   You've got to admit, sit down on a tablet.
[00:33:42.880 --> 00:33:44.680]   The kids immediately grok a tablet.
[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:45.680]   Nobody.
[00:33:45.680 --> 00:33:47.680]   They can sit down on my watch.
[00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:51.720]   They can sit down in an iPad and they know how to use it.
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:53.160]   Two year olds know how to use it.
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:55.000]   Yeah, I have a two year old and that's what we do.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   We do every day.
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   We spend a little bit of time in place.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.480]   With that two year old in front of Windows 8.1, I don't think you're going to have the
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:00.480]   same result.
[00:34:00.480 --> 00:34:03.840]   Well, actually the Surface tablet he can use because it has the tile screen.
[00:34:03.840 --> 00:34:04.840]   Right.
[00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:06.840]   So does he accidentally aren't proficient with it?
[00:34:06.840 --> 00:34:07.840]   Oh, yeah.
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:10.000]   Yeah, except where's the YouTube app?
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.080]   That's the first thing my kids look for.
[00:34:12.080 --> 00:34:13.080]   But they're older, right?
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:14.080]   It's a place.
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:16.080]   No, I have a four year old and a six year old.
[00:34:16.080 --> 00:34:17.080]   That you could blame Google.
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:21.800]   My point is if he got thrown into OS 10's desktop or the Windows 8 desktop or any other
[00:34:21.800 --> 00:34:24.560]   Linux desktop tablet, they would just walk away.
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:25.840]   It's just broken.
[00:34:25.840 --> 00:34:30.680]   So I started all this because Microsoft has pulled back another example of dumbing down
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:31.680]   the public.
[00:34:31.680 --> 00:34:34.120]   I end with that thought.
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:35.120]   You may continue.
[00:34:35.120 --> 00:34:36.120]   I'm sorry.
[00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:37.120]   This is a couple of days.
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:39.120]   What's the aggravation scale now?
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:41.120]   It's going to be iterating.
[00:34:41.120 --> 00:34:42.120]   Am I high?
[00:34:42.120 --> 00:34:44.680]   No, I'm not high.
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:51.000]   Windows, Windows 1, the Surface upgrade has been pulled by Microsoft because it did brick.
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:52.160]   You're lucky in eel.
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:53.720]   It brings a lot of people.
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:54.720]   They pulled it off, right?
[00:34:54.720 --> 00:34:55.720]   They've pulled it.
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:57.720]   You cannot upgrade your RT.
[00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:58.720]   Oops.
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:01.560]   A little bit of a black eye.
[00:35:01.560 --> 00:35:02.560]   A situation.
[00:35:02.560 --> 00:35:05.040]   A situation has arisen.
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:06.200]   Here's the situation.
[00:35:06.200 --> 00:35:07.760]   What's the situation?
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:14.040]   The situation is it messes with the boot sector so that you essentially put you into
[00:35:14.040 --> 00:35:15.040]   a loop.
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:16.840]   You can't boot the machine once you've done this.
[00:35:16.840 --> 00:35:19.400]   I think an eel downloaded the developer.
[00:35:19.400 --> 00:35:21.360]   Yeah, I got like a gold bits, right?
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:23.400]   You got the gold bits, the finished gold bits.
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:27.920]   Which by the way, do I believe what an eel did is probably what they did at Microsoft.
[00:35:27.920 --> 00:35:32.760]   So all the self-testing that went on at the company, they never went from zero to two.
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:34.800]   They all went one, two, three steps.
[00:35:34.800 --> 00:35:37.720]   I have a story about the first iPhones.
[00:35:37.720 --> 00:35:44.600]   Before you do that, quick tip, make your recovery disk before you upgrade anytime.
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:48.480]   If you have a recovery on Surface RT, it's a snap to go back and fix it.
[00:35:48.480 --> 00:35:53.600]   But if you didn't make your recovery, go borrow somebody else's because that's what you need.
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:54.600]   I think John's exactly right.
[00:35:54.600 --> 00:35:58.040]   They all tested like I did and they didn't think about what an actual consumer would do.
[00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:00.680]   But there's no recovery disk on Windows RT.
[00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:01.680]   No.
[00:36:01.680 --> 00:36:02.680]   No, no.
[00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:03.680]   You can make a flash drive.
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:04.680]   You can make a flash drive.
[00:36:04.680 --> 00:36:05.680]   You can make a flash drive.
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:06.680]   But you can't go get somebody else's in other words.
[00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:08.880]   Either do it on that machine or you don't do it.
[00:36:08.880 --> 00:36:09.880]   Oh, is that true?
[00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:10.880]   You can't use that.
[00:36:10.880 --> 00:36:11.880]   It's personal to you.
[00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:12.880]   Yeah.
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:13.880]   How ironic.
[00:36:13.880 --> 00:36:14.880]   It's not good.
[00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:15.880]   Awful, internally.
[00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:16.880]   iPhone story.
[00:36:16.880 --> 00:36:21.800]   Well, when they were launching the first iPhone, back then, before they were launched,
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:27.960]   they hand graded about a hundred of the first prototypes and they had them in piles.
[00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:33.200]   And the best ones right before launch didn't have any software on them and they loaded
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:39.000]   the software and it burned the best for iPhones dead.
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:45.440]   So they used those four iPhones in the stands where you couldn't touch them.
[00:36:45.440 --> 00:36:46.440]   Smart.
[00:36:46.440 --> 00:36:51.040]   And they painted the icons on by the little tiny brush.
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:53.240]   My next-door neighbor was on the first iPhone too.
[00:36:53.240 --> 00:36:55.240]   Some of those stories.
[00:36:55.240 --> 00:36:57.840]   The great New York Times story we referred to a couple of weeks ago.
[00:36:57.840 --> 00:36:59.480]   He was the guy in that story.
[00:36:59.480 --> 00:37:00.480]   He's the guy in the story?
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:01.480]   Yeah.
[00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:02.480]   What a tale he told.
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:04.360]   So we're going to have Nick Bilton on next week.
[00:37:04.360 --> 00:37:07.200]   He's writing the book about Twitter.
[00:37:07.200 --> 00:37:09.080]   He's going to tell some of those stories.
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:12.880]   And then the Wired book is by...
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:13.880]   Fred Vogelstein.
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:14.880]   Fred Vogelstein.
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:15.880]   I want to get him on.
[00:37:15.880 --> 00:37:16.880]   Yeah.
[00:37:16.880 --> 00:37:17.880]   And then there's this new Amazon book.
[00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:18.880]   Brad Stone.
[00:37:18.880 --> 00:37:19.880]   By Brad Stone.
[00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:21.720]   There are three great kind of...
[00:37:21.720 --> 00:37:24.120]   I've been waiting for these behind the scenes stories.
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:26.720]   I'll ask Stephen Levy's famous soul of the new machine.
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:29.680]   I got the Amazon one and the Twitter one and they're both good.
[00:37:29.680 --> 00:37:30.680]   And I just...
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:31.680]   Great.
[00:37:31.680 --> 00:37:35.360]   My best friend is the guy in the Apple book.
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:37.360]   So he's been telling me these stories.
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:38.360]   Can't wait to read.
[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:39.360]   It is great.
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:40.360]   But it's a real reporting.
[00:37:40.360 --> 00:37:41.600]   I mean, that's the thing I love about these books.
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:42.800]   They are the real reporting.
[00:37:42.800 --> 00:37:43.800]   You look at everybody.
[00:37:43.800 --> 00:37:46.920]   I complain all the time about the tech blogs and how superficial and stupid they are.
[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:48.520]   This is the opposite extreme.
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:52.600]   This is like years of interviews with all kinds of people from the company.
[00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:53.760]   People who left the company.
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:56.200]   It's like, that's the thing I love is people putting in the work.
[00:37:56.200 --> 00:37:57.200]   Can't wait to read them.
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:00.240]   You know, I'm reading right now is Dave Eggers knew the circle.
[00:38:00.240 --> 00:38:04.880]   Which is basically a romance, a clef about Google.
[00:38:04.880 --> 00:38:05.880]   And kind of the...
[00:38:05.880 --> 00:38:06.880]   And Facebook a little bit too.
[00:38:06.880 --> 00:38:07.880]   Yeah, I can't tell.
[00:38:07.880 --> 00:38:08.880]   Is it Facebook?
[00:38:08.880 --> 00:38:09.880]   Is it Google?
[00:38:09.880 --> 00:38:10.880]   Is it Apple?
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:11.880]   Yeah, I think it's sort of...
[00:38:11.880 --> 00:38:12.880]   The CEO, the founder, wears a hoodie.
[00:38:12.880 --> 00:38:14.080]   So maybe it is Facebook.
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:15.880]   It's a great novel though.
[00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:16.880]   Yeah.
[00:38:16.880 --> 00:38:18.640]   Who is the soul of the new machine by Kitter?
[00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:20.000]   Tracy Kitter, you're right.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   What was Stephen Levy's?
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:22.000]   Oh, he did Hacker.
[00:38:22.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   Hackers.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   Yeah, Hacker's.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   That's right.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.480]   I just love those embedded reporter stories.
[00:38:27.480 --> 00:38:32.000]   There was another one called Showstopper Pascal's, as you pack Pascal's, Acree, your buddy.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   I wrote that.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.480]   It was all about the creation of Windows NT.
[00:38:35.480 --> 00:38:36.480]   Windows NT.
[00:38:36.480 --> 00:38:37.480]   Right.
[00:38:37.480 --> 00:38:43.560]   I love those embedded reporter or heavily research reporter stories about the beginnings of things.
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:47.480]   By the way, I love Amazon because if you go to any of those three books...
[00:38:47.480 --> 00:38:49.120]   I'll tell you about my book.
[00:38:49.120 --> 00:38:50.120]   That's good.
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:53.000]   It says, "People who buy this book don't survive my book."
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   Yeah, that's a good idea.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.520]   Now, I don't care about the plug.
[00:38:55.520 --> 00:38:57.000]   As long as I'm on that Amazon page...
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.520]   That's really the best place to be.
[00:38:59.520 --> 00:39:02.160]   We should mention Robert's newest book just came out.
[00:39:02.160 --> 00:39:04.720]   It's his second book with Shell Israel.
[00:39:04.720 --> 00:39:09.040]   This is called, "Now the Age of Context, Mobile Sensors, Data and the Future of Privacy."
[00:39:09.040 --> 00:39:10.880]   Timing's pretty good on this.
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:13.040]   Yeah, very good.
[00:39:13.040 --> 00:39:17.360]   I'll tell you what, but you got a log roll by Vikkundotra on there.
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:18.360]   That's pretty good.
[00:39:18.360 --> 00:39:19.360]   Well, he was one of the inspirations...
[00:39:19.360 --> 00:39:21.800]   You spelled his name wrong on the back.
[00:39:21.800 --> 00:39:22.800]   That's fixed on...
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:23.800]   It would be...
[00:39:23.800 --> 00:39:24.800]   Nice.
[00:39:24.800 --> 00:39:26.800]   It would be probably the most amazing book.
[00:39:26.800 --> 00:39:29.800]   The reason you got the free ones is because these are the early copies.
[00:39:29.800 --> 00:39:30.800]   Thanks, global.
[00:39:30.800 --> 00:39:33.800]   It's probably a bunch of...
[00:39:33.800 --> 00:39:35.800]   Actually, inside, it's all empty.
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:36.800]   It's fine.
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:37.800]   It's fine.
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:38.800]   It's fine.
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:39.800]   Review Galli.
[00:39:39.800 --> 00:39:40.800]   It's a good barcode.
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:41.800]   One thing...
[00:39:41.800 --> 00:39:44.800]   We still have the barcode for the correct edit.
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:47.800]   We self-publish an Amazon Prince this book for us.
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:48.800]   Oh, really?
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:49.800]   And so we don't have a book publisher.
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:50.800]   And Amazon had this...
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:52.800]   That's where an editor really makes a difference.
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:54.800]   We have to be out here.
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:56.800]   Actually, we heard our own editor.
[00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:58.800]   That's the way to do it.
[00:39:58.800 --> 00:39:59.800]   Sure.
[00:39:59.800 --> 00:40:00.800]   This got on...
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:01.800]   It's not posting.
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:04.800]   In your box in two weeks after we should finish the book.
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:05.800]   That's cool.
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:08.800]   And most book authors have to wait three months, six months.
[00:40:08.800 --> 00:40:11.800]   Did you use a Squarespace template for the pages or is this...
[00:40:11.800 --> 00:40:12.800]   We used...
[00:40:12.800 --> 00:40:16.800]   No, we used whatever Amazon does for you.
[00:40:16.800 --> 00:40:17.800]   Nice.
[00:40:17.800 --> 00:40:20.800]   You take Word doc into Adobe...
[00:40:20.800 --> 00:40:21.800]   Do you mail these out?
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:24.800]   Because if you did, you might want to be thinking about stamps.com.
[00:40:24.800 --> 00:40:27.800]   Actually, I do mail out some of the comments.
[00:40:27.800 --> 00:40:28.800]   Segway number two.
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:29.800]   But most of the comments...
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:31.800]   I think anybody does a lot of mailing.
[00:40:31.800 --> 00:40:32.800]   It's really...
[00:40:32.800 --> 00:40:34.800]   It's be crazy to go to the post office by...
[00:40:34.800 --> 00:40:35.800]   Stamps, Lea.
[00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:36.800]   It's nuts, Lea.
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:37.800]   It's nuts.
[00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:39.800]   Tell me if you do this, John, because I do this.
[00:40:39.800 --> 00:40:42.800]   If you're mailing a package, you don't know exactly what it is.
[00:40:42.800 --> 00:40:43.800]   Don't you...
[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:46.800]   You don't want to send a post to juice, so you always put a little extra.
[00:40:46.800 --> 00:40:47.800]   Like, I know it's not...
[00:40:47.800 --> 00:40:48.800]   I don't even know what they do post to juice.
[00:40:48.800 --> 00:40:50.800]   I think they just send it back to you.
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:53.800]   No, I've gotten post to juice, and it's very embarrassing to the sender.
[00:40:53.800 --> 00:40:54.800]   Oh, you got to give me a...
[00:40:54.800 --> 00:40:57.800]   I got to give you a nickel to get my package.
[00:40:57.800 --> 00:41:00.800]   So, I always put like an extra buck or so.
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:02.800]   Oh, you're just one of those guys.
[00:41:02.800 --> 00:41:03.800]   Overpay.
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:04.800]   Yeah, you overpay.
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:05.800]   That's bad.
[00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:06.800]   Stupid.
[00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:08.800]   You have to be a squanderer to do that.
[00:41:08.800 --> 00:41:09.800]   And I'm no longer a squanderer.
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:14.800]   Now that I have the USB scale from stamps.com, I know exactly what the postage is.
[00:41:14.800 --> 00:41:19.800]   In fact, stamps.com will even look at the thing and suggest a class of mail to you.
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:24.800]   If the postage rates go up, which they seem to do at random times, it will automatically update.
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:25.800]   You don't have to...
[00:41:25.800 --> 00:41:26.800]   You don't have to...
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:27.800]   You don't have to...
[00:41:27.800 --> 00:41:28.800]   I just found out...
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:30.800]   With a postage meter, you have to bring it to the post office to update the rates.
[00:41:30.800 --> 00:41:31.800]   That's cookie.
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:32.800]   Yeah.
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:33.800]   Pus...
[00:41:33.800 --> 00:41:34.800]   Cookie is exactly what I was thinking.
[00:41:34.800 --> 00:41:35.800]   Ink.
[00:41:35.800 --> 00:41:39.800]   I saw a stamp with a picture on it the other day.
[00:41:39.800 --> 00:41:40.800]   Can you get those done at $2.com?
[00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:41.800]   Yes.
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:42.800]   Yes, you can have your picture on it.
[00:41:42.800 --> 00:41:43.800]   My wife thought that was so cool.
[00:41:43.800 --> 00:41:44.800]   I think it'd be scary.
[00:41:44.800 --> 00:41:48.800]   She's like, "How did she talk to the government into putting her picture on it?"
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:50.800]   I have Leo stamps.
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:51.800]   It's great.
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:53.800]   Well, it also stamps.com will print on the envelope.
[00:41:53.800 --> 00:41:57.800]   If you're mailing, like, you know, something in an envelope, it'll print your return address,
[00:41:57.800 --> 00:42:01.800]   it'll print your logo, it'll print, you know, it takes the address from QuickBooks,
[00:42:01.800 --> 00:42:02.800]   from...
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:05.800]   If you do Amazon, eBay, Etsy, PayPal, any of those, it'll take you from there.
[00:42:05.800 --> 00:42:08.800]   If you do international mailing fills out the forms ahead of time.
[00:42:08.800 --> 00:42:09.800]   Holy crap.
[00:42:09.800 --> 00:42:10.800]   And...
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:11.800]   Isn't this amazing?
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:13.800]   I'm telling you, I'm in.
[00:42:13.800 --> 00:42:16.800]   It's going to be harder to tell me.
[00:42:16.800 --> 00:42:18.800]   I've always, like, stamped that I've come, by the way.
[00:42:18.800 --> 00:42:19.800]   I just love it.
[00:42:19.800 --> 00:42:22.800]   I have enjoyed this company since they began.
[00:42:22.800 --> 00:42:23.800]   I just play to him.
[00:42:23.800 --> 00:42:24.800]   Did you know this?
[00:42:24.800 --> 00:42:25.800]   I bet you didn't.
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:31.800]   Postage meter ink is 100 times more expensive than ink jet ink, which is already overpriced.
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:32.800]   Whoa.
[00:42:32.800 --> 00:42:33.800]   You mean your talents...
[00:42:33.800 --> 00:42:35.800]   You tell me the Pitney Bose.
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:36.800]   Yeah.
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:37.800]   Don't mention a name.
[00:42:37.800 --> 00:42:38.800]   The competitors.
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:40.800]   The competitors with the stamps.com.
[00:42:40.800 --> 00:42:41.800]   Those are the guys.
[00:42:41.800 --> 00:42:43.800]   The old school people.
[00:42:43.800 --> 00:42:45.800]   What you're telling me is...
[00:42:45.800 --> 00:42:49.800]   They're making money on the ink to the extent that the ink jet printer people are.
[00:42:49.800 --> 00:42:50.800]   Yeah.
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:51.800]   More than...
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:52.800]   More.
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:53.800]   More.
[00:42:53.800 --> 00:42:54.800]   It's a scandal.
[00:42:54.800 --> 00:42:56.800]   Have you ever seen somebody bringing their postage meter into the...
[00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:59.800]   It looks like they've got a nuclear core in the box.
[00:42:59.800 --> 00:43:01.800]   You have to have two people to carry the ink.
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:02.800]   It's crazy.
[00:43:02.800 --> 00:43:03.800]   Anyway.
[00:43:03.800 --> 00:43:06.800]   They have a handcuff, the handcuff that the briefcase that carries the ink.
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:07.800]   You'd be insane.
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:08.800]   Go to stamps.com.
[00:43:08.800 --> 00:43:10.800]   Everything you need.
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:12.800]   In fact, but the key is you're going to see this $80 value.
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:14.800]   You're going to say, "Oh, there's a scale and a lovely young lady."
[00:43:14.800 --> 00:43:16.800]   And a lovely young lady pointing at it.
[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:17.800]   "I'm going to click her."
[00:43:17.800 --> 00:43:18.800]   Do not.
[00:43:18.800 --> 00:43:19.800]   Do not.
[00:43:19.800 --> 00:43:21.800]   You click on the microphone at the top there.
[00:43:21.800 --> 00:43:24.800]   Enter in the offer code TWIT.
[00:43:24.800 --> 00:43:25.800]   Press go.
[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:27.800]   And instead of that lovely lady, you get this.
[00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:28.800]   Oh my God.
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:32.800]   You should have a model instead of your ugly mug on it.
[00:43:32.800 --> 00:43:34.800]   I'm apologizing for that.
[00:43:34.800 --> 00:43:35.800]   But look what happened to the value.
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:36.800]   It went from an $80.
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:37.800]   Holy mac.
[00:43:37.800 --> 00:43:38.800]   Offro.
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:39.800]   $110.
[00:43:39.800 --> 00:43:42.800]   We give you $55 in free postage.
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:43.800]   How could they afford this?
[00:43:43.800 --> 00:43:44.800]   They don't even understand how that works.
[00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:45.800]   Venture capital.
[00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:46.800]   Free this.
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:47.800]   It'll stay in.
[00:43:47.800 --> 00:43:50.800]   You get a supply kit and a four week trial, of course.
[00:43:50.800 --> 00:43:51.800]   Stamps.
[00:43:51.800 --> 00:43:54.800]   I think most people that do Etsy have this already.
[00:43:54.800 --> 00:43:55.800]   Oh God, yeah.
[00:43:55.800 --> 00:43:57.800]   You'd be crazy not to.
[00:43:57.800 --> 00:43:58.800]   It's the only way to do this.
[00:43:58.800 --> 00:44:01.800]   Unless you really love your post office, which I don't know anybody who does.
[00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:02.800]   I used to go to the post office.
[00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:03.800]   I love my post office.
[00:44:03.800 --> 00:44:05.800]   I have a great post office.
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:06.800]   Seriously.
[00:44:06.800 --> 00:44:08.800]   They move along and they got people in and out.
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:11.800]   It turns out that the post office is kind of a federalist system.
[00:44:11.800 --> 00:44:15.800]   Every individual post office is managed separately.
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:20.800]   That explains a lot because ours, these guys move at the snails base.
[00:44:20.800 --> 00:44:26.400]   You wait and line, wait and line and then they go clump, close the doors and take a break.
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:30.720]   It's very interesting if you look into the structure of the post office.
[00:44:30.720 --> 00:44:34.040]   It's a very uncentralized operation.
[00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:38.280]   You have the individual postmasters at the various little post offices kind of run their
[00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:39.280]   own fife dumb.
[00:44:39.280 --> 00:44:43.760]   So you have a crap postmaster in your place.
[00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:44.760]   You're going to get crap service.
[00:44:44.760 --> 00:44:45.760]   That makes sense.
[00:44:45.760 --> 00:44:46.760]   Yeah.
[00:44:46.760 --> 00:44:47.760]   That's why it's very nice.
[00:44:47.760 --> 00:44:48.760]   Stamps.com instead.
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:50.960]   Or if you have a good post office, you don't have to.
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:51.960]   What is this?
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:52.960]   No, you can just take this.
[00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:57.520]   So we're having an unboxing just even while John and I are talking about the scobles board.
[00:44:57.520 --> 00:45:00.720]   Stippy in the chat room says, I can just do postage.
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:01.720]   I can.
[00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:02.720]   Stippy Kessus.
[00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:03.720]   I'm not a Nesee user.
[00:45:03.720 --> 00:45:07.320]   I imagine Leo and John playing checkers on the porch of a country store in Vermont drinking
[00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:09.320]   grape knee highs and grapey.
[00:45:09.320 --> 00:45:11.320]   Who is this?
[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:12.320]   Me?
[00:45:12.320 --> 00:45:13.320]   Nailed us.
[00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:14.320]   I think that's exactly right.
[00:45:14.320 --> 00:45:16.600]   So what you brought this from Oakley Oakley?
[00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:19.560]   Is Oak now, what's the relationship of Oakley to Red?
[00:45:19.560 --> 00:45:21.200]   Because he started Red, right?
[00:45:21.200 --> 00:45:22.200]   Yeah.
[00:45:22.200 --> 00:45:27.640]   The founder of Oakley sold Oakley to Lexotica on Oakley too.
[00:45:27.640 --> 00:45:29.640]   They own everything.
[00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:32.320]   And they're making these and charming.
[00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:34.200]   Now the ski gogs aren't what's interesting.
[00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:36.800]   Is there anything you won't put on your head, Robert?
[00:45:36.800 --> 00:45:38.400]   I don't ask.
[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:40.840]   It's not, I'm not judging.
[00:45:40.840 --> 00:45:42.280]   There's not much.
[00:45:42.280 --> 00:45:44.440]   Yeah, I admire that actually.
[00:45:44.440 --> 00:45:45.440]   Look, there's not much.
[00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:46.440]   There's not much.
[00:45:46.440 --> 00:45:47.840]   I could afford the real thing.
[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:48.840]   So I've got the.
[00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:49.840]   Come to Burning Man, man.
[00:45:49.840 --> 00:45:50.840]   Come to Burning Man.
[00:45:50.840 --> 00:45:52.560]   You'll find out what goes on my head.
[00:45:52.560 --> 00:45:53.560]   So what?
[00:45:53.560 --> 00:45:55.560]   We don't want to know.
[00:45:55.560 --> 00:45:59.120]   So what makes the, now they've made, I've, they had USB goggles.
[00:45:59.120 --> 00:46:00.120]   You could play your eye cod.
[00:46:00.120 --> 00:46:01.120]   Yeah.
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:05.000]   So inside here and I don't know where I should hold over to put it on camera.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   We want to put it on camera.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.600]   But inside here there's a recon instruments computer with a screen.
[00:46:10.600 --> 00:46:11.600]   Oh, it's Google Glass.
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:16.240]   Well, it's, it's similar to Google Glass and it has a computer and a sensor.
[00:46:16.240 --> 00:46:18.160]   So tell you how fast you're falling?
[00:46:18.160 --> 00:46:20.000]   It tells you how fast you're going.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   Yeah.
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.760]   How long your hang time was, where you are on the mountain.
[00:46:23.760 --> 00:46:28.520]   And if you give all your kids the airtime app on their Android or iOS phone, you can
[00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:30.320]   see where they are on the mountain.
[00:46:30.320 --> 00:46:31.320]   Wow.
[00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:32.840]   And chat with them and do a whole bunch.
[00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:34.440]   Sunny Bono would have loved these.
[00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:35.440]   You needed it.
[00:46:35.440 --> 00:46:36.440]   Wow, he needed it.
[00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:37.440]   Oh, that's kind of cold.
[00:46:37.440 --> 00:46:38.440]   That's a pretty bad joke.
[00:46:38.440 --> 00:46:42.360]   That was pretty, very, very bad.
[00:46:42.360 --> 00:46:44.680]   I think we should only insult him about the copyright law.
[00:46:44.680 --> 00:46:48.760]   Not anyway, this is more of the where I'm going to the Consumer Electronics Association
[00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:51.760]   on Tuesday and this is some of the stuff that they're talking about.
[00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:52.760]   How much do they weigh?
[00:46:52.760 --> 00:46:54.000]   Is it like a bowling ball or is it like?
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:55.560]   No, this is like, it says ski goggle.
[00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:58.640]   It's the same same, same weight as the ski goggle.
[00:46:58.640 --> 00:46:59.840]   You know, you don't know.
[00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:02.600]   Like they might just, like they used to make those things that weigh 20 pounds.
[00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:03.600]   Like the thought of people.
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:04.600]   Like they're actually surprising.
[00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:08.040]   Like, what's interesting, is that the same kind of, I mean, this is basically a stock
[00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:09.600]   screen you can get anywhere.
[00:47:09.600 --> 00:47:11.320]   Is it the same kind of screen that the goggle glasses?
[00:47:11.320 --> 00:47:12.320]   It's similar.
[00:47:12.320 --> 00:47:13.320]   It's a small screen.
[00:47:13.320 --> 00:47:14.840]   It's not a wrap around.
[00:47:14.840 --> 00:47:18.080]   You know, when we had on a triangulation on Wednesday, and if you haven't watched it,
[00:47:18.080 --> 00:47:22.320]   you should, it's Jerry Ellsworth, they're doing the new cast AR, the augmented reality
[00:47:22.320 --> 00:47:25.400]   glasses, they're very, the idea is amazing.
[00:47:25.400 --> 00:47:27.200]   She invented it at Steam.
[00:47:27.200 --> 00:47:31.960]   When Steam fired her, she went in a game, Newell, and she said, can I just take these
[00:47:31.960 --> 00:47:32.960]   with me?
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:33.960]   Yes.
[00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:36.080]   Which is unheard of.
[00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:42.000]   They have, so you're wearing, they look like sunglasses, and over each eye, there are two
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   pecos.
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:44.000]   Peacos.
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   Right.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   Two projectors.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.440]   Little pecos projectors, the kind you'd see on the cell phones.
[00:47:48.440 --> 00:47:51.640]   And then over your nose, there's a camera.
[00:47:51.640 --> 00:47:57.080]   And it projects onto, you have to have a screen surf as it projects onto the camera,
[00:47:57.080 --> 00:48:01.880]   is looking at special LEDs that so they know how your head is positioned.
[00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:06.040]   And it's amazing, you're looking, you could see the real world, it's your heads up, but
[00:48:06.040 --> 00:48:09.480]   you're also seeing a display on top of it, it's varied.
[00:48:09.480 --> 00:48:15.360]   There's another startup called Meta, which is doing two screen glasses for gaming and
[00:48:15.360 --> 00:48:16.360]   stuff.
[00:48:16.360 --> 00:48:17.360]   There's a lot of animation.
[00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:18.360]   There's a lot of even wearables.
[00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:20.240]   I don't think that the Google Glass is it.
[00:48:20.240 --> 00:48:24.560]   I played with the Galaxy Gear for a while, it's not quite there, the Pebble not right
[00:48:24.560 --> 00:48:25.560]   there.
[00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:26.560]   Well, first of all, this is a prototype.
[00:48:26.560 --> 00:48:29.920]   So when we see the shipping product in March, let's say.
[00:48:29.920 --> 00:48:30.920]   You think that's true?
[00:48:30.920 --> 00:48:32.880]   Yeah, we're going to see it by May.
[00:48:32.880 --> 00:48:38.200]   You're going to be able to buy them by May, otherwise Google really will miss the market.
[00:48:38.200 --> 00:48:40.600]   Because Apple will in June or sometimes.
[00:48:40.600 --> 00:48:41.600]   If there's a point.
[00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:43.160]   They're coming out with the eye watch.
[00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:46.080]   See, is there a market in the old you think?
[00:48:46.080 --> 00:48:47.080]   May.
[00:48:47.080 --> 00:48:48.080]   No, I agree.
[00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:49.080]   I disagree.
[00:48:49.080 --> 00:48:50.080]   I agree to watch it.
[00:48:50.080 --> 00:48:54.040]   Not a 2014 market, but I've shown an 800 people.
[00:48:54.040 --> 00:48:57.040]   I was at the Pumpkin Festival in Half Moon Bay today, people were stopping me.
[00:48:57.040 --> 00:48:58.040]   The Pumpkin Festival.
[00:48:58.040 --> 00:48:59.040]   Oh yeah.
[00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:00.040]   Today.
[00:49:00.040 --> 00:49:02.040]   And you came all the way up here from Half Moon Bay.
[00:49:02.040 --> 00:49:03.040]   All the way.
[00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:04.040]   Wow.
[00:49:04.040 --> 00:49:05.040]   That's like two hours.
[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:08.840]   It was two hours and 15 minutes because of the traffic from the Pumpkin Festival.
[00:49:08.840 --> 00:49:10.000]   Oh, thank you for coming.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:14.560]   So the Pumpkin Festival, they were all googoo gaga over something.
[00:49:14.560 --> 00:49:15.880]   People love wearing these.
[00:49:15.880 --> 00:49:17.920]   Oh, because you had the glasses on.
[00:49:17.920 --> 00:49:18.920]   And they were pumpkin colors.
[00:49:18.920 --> 00:49:24.520]   Now that's the same attention if you were 10 feet tall or painted blue.
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:26.000]   I think it's really good.
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:27.720]   This is easier than paying myself blue.
[00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:29.920]   I mean, I'm just saying is you're free.
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:32.640]   That doesn't mean they're really wanting your people to put them on.
[00:49:32.640 --> 00:49:33.880]   And they say this is the coolest thing.
[00:49:33.880 --> 00:49:36.640]   I recorded some high school girls in audio.
[00:49:36.640 --> 00:49:38.240]   You can listen to the problem right there.
[00:49:38.240 --> 00:49:39.240]   High school girls.
[00:49:39.240 --> 00:49:40.240]   Yeah, that is the issue.
[00:49:40.240 --> 00:49:42.320]   Boy, I thought they were going to give me crap.
[00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:43.560]   So I started recording.
[00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:44.560]   Give you what?
[00:49:44.560 --> 00:49:46.040]   I thought they walked by me and started whispering.
[00:49:46.040 --> 00:49:47.920]   I thought they were going to call me a dork or something.
[00:49:47.920 --> 00:49:48.920]   So you're the only one who hasn't.
[00:49:48.920 --> 00:49:52.440]   No, one of them was going to crawl behind you and one is going to push you.
[00:49:52.440 --> 00:49:54.000]   No one would call you.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   No.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.680]   So Dwight Silver, you know, one that hasn't.
[00:49:57.680 --> 00:49:58.680]   Wait in.
[00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:02.240]   We have a meh, a yay, a meh, and a meh.
[00:50:02.240 --> 00:50:03.240]   Wearables.
[00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:04.240]   What do you think?
[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:05.240]   Not yet.
[00:50:05.240 --> 00:50:06.240]   I think it's.
[00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:09.960]   I said it will be a big deal, but none of what we're seeing right now is what is going
[00:50:09.960 --> 00:50:11.680]   to catch on ultimately.
[00:50:11.680 --> 00:50:16.560]   I don't think that I've tried Google Glass and you get that kind of initial, oh my God,
[00:50:16.560 --> 00:50:17.560]   this is cool.
[00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:21.960]   And then the more you use it, the kind of more, the more you run into the obstacles for
[00:50:21.960 --> 00:50:23.640]   it being truly useful.
[00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:25.280]   You know, Robert's an enthusiast.
[00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:29.280]   But you put it on the head of people who like want to do it to actually do things and I
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:32.960]   think it becomes, it becomes more clunky than useful.
[00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:33.960]   And the same thing is true.
[00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:38.600]   The Galaxy gear, Galaxy gear is a great proof of concept, but it is not there yet.
[00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:43.800]   And I think we haven't yet seen what actually is going to work, but I think it will, it will
[00:50:43.800 --> 00:50:44.800]   have the.
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:46.480]   I wear a Nike fuel band every day.
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:47.640]   It's a great watch.
[00:50:47.640 --> 00:50:49.080]   It gets me off the couch.
[00:50:49.080 --> 00:50:50.080]   That's good enough.
[00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:51.080]   Yeah.
[00:50:51.080 --> 00:50:53.600]   So, you know, the problem is you guys haven't seen like this is going to be cool, but like
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:54.840]   a watch is.
[00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:56.840]   The problem is you haven't seen what this is going to be.
[00:50:56.840 --> 00:51:00.920]   This is the first consumer electronics device that knows where I'm aimed full time, right?
[00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:01.920]   It comes on.
[00:51:01.920 --> 00:51:02.920]   You're talking about the glass.
[00:51:02.920 --> 00:51:03.920]   And right.
[00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:04.920]   And where I'm looking.
[00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:07.680]   There's an eye sensor here, neither of which have been turned on yet.
[00:51:07.680 --> 00:51:12.280]   There's games, for instance, that I've seen built that were hacked into the glass where
[00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:16.000]   aliens come off the ceiling and you ain't and you shoot them just by looking at them.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.640]   There's a lot of functionality to come.
[00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:23.840]   And that's why you can't base where the market's going to be based on this product.
[00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:26.640]   There's potential, but it feels like you remember.
[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:27.920]   And I'm sure, Robert, you do.
[00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:30.400]   Microsoft made their tablets in 2002.
[00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:32.160]   I was a tablet evangelist at Microsoft.
[00:51:32.160 --> 00:51:33.160]   Right.
[00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:34.160]   I know that.
[00:51:34.160 --> 00:51:36.480]   So took a little longer to get it off the ground.
[00:51:36.480 --> 00:51:40.440]   Where tablets as an idea valuable, sure.
[00:51:40.440 --> 00:51:44.480]   Was the product conception so far off as to be almost unrecognizable compared to what
[00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:45.480]   actually succeeded?
[00:51:45.480 --> 00:51:46.480]   Yeah.
[00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:50.040]   I think in 2014, it's going to be the Apple I watch.
[00:51:50.040 --> 00:51:51.040]   It's going to clean up.
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:52.040]   Yes.
[00:51:52.040 --> 00:51:54.440]   So you're going to watch your big watch.
[00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:56.920]   Well, let's be honest.
[00:51:56.920 --> 00:51:57.920]   This is not done.
[00:51:57.920 --> 00:51:58.920]   We don't know the price.
[00:51:58.920 --> 00:52:00.080]   We don't know the we don't know.
[00:52:00.080 --> 00:52:01.480]   There's a there's no app store.
[00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:03.880]   There's no a back to the watch.
[00:52:03.880 --> 00:52:07.160]   The Apple I watch is is closer to being done.
[00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:11.200]   And the people I know have seen it say it's spectacular and it's going to blow away all
[00:52:11.200 --> 00:52:13.280]   the other other watches in the market.
[00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:14.480]   So you know people have seen it?
[00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:15.480]   Yeah.
[00:52:15.480 --> 00:52:17.280]   This book is kind of about this stuff, right?
[00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:18.280]   Yeah.
[00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:19.280]   Age of context.
[00:52:19.280 --> 00:52:20.280]   So tell us what you heard about this.
[00:52:20.280 --> 00:52:21.280]   Yeah.
[00:52:21.280 --> 00:52:25.080]   Anyone in the world has seen people who it has a curved glass screen with the Willow glass
[00:52:25.080 --> 00:52:26.080]   from Corning.
[00:52:26.080 --> 00:52:27.920]   Corning is the the glass main fact.
[00:52:27.920 --> 00:52:28.920]   Right.
[00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:29.920]   Well, you know that gorilla glass, right?
[00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:31.480]   And they have this new flexible glass.
[00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:32.760]   We know that too.
[00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:37.560]   And it's the new watch is very beautiful and uses this this flexible glass with a really
[00:52:37.560 --> 00:52:39.480]   nice screen on it.
[00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:41.200]   And it's going to be fashion.
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:43.440]   Why did they just hire the lady from Burberry?
[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:44.440]   Hannah.
[00:52:44.440 --> 00:52:45.440]   Right.
[00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:46.440]   The CEO from Burberry.
[00:52:46.440 --> 00:52:47.440]   What's her name?
[00:52:47.440 --> 00:52:48.440]   Arnett.
[00:52:48.440 --> 00:52:49.440]   Lawrence.
[00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:50.440]   Not Hannah.
[00:52:50.440 --> 00:52:53.720]   The CEO hired somebody from Levi's who also is.
[00:52:53.720 --> 00:52:54.720]   And they hired the guy.
[00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:55.720]   The Nike guy.
[00:52:55.720 --> 00:52:56.920]   The guy then from Nike, right?
[00:52:56.920 --> 00:53:04.160]   So they're they're building a stable of talent at Apple that's all about lifestyle and fashion.
[00:53:04.160 --> 00:53:05.880]   And there's a big hint there.
[00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:06.880]   Yeah.
[00:53:06.880 --> 00:53:07.880]   There's a big hint there.
[00:53:07.880 --> 00:53:13.280]   The fact that they hired an executive from the CEO of Burberry, which is weird to be a
[00:53:13.280 --> 00:53:16.640]   senior vice president at Apple, which shows how Burberry and Apple are related.
[00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:20.880]   But what she did is took a fairly stuffy British brand and make it hip.
[00:53:20.880 --> 00:53:22.960]   You see the Burberry tartan everywhere now.
[00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:25.920]   It is a fashion look.
[00:53:25.920 --> 00:53:27.720]   And so it's in pop songs, right?
[00:53:27.720 --> 00:53:28.720]   It's in rap songs.
[00:53:28.720 --> 00:53:31.160]   It's in top 40 hits.
[00:53:31.160 --> 00:53:32.160]   Angela.
[00:53:32.160 --> 00:53:33.160]   Angela.
[00:53:33.160 --> 00:53:39.000]   So she's the new head of retail at Apple and more than retail, she gets digital as well.
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:40.760]   So she gets the iTunes store.
[00:53:40.760 --> 00:53:41.760]   She gets the app store.
[00:53:41.760 --> 00:53:43.640]   This is a big hire.
[00:53:43.640 --> 00:53:44.640]   And I think you're right.
[00:53:44.640 --> 00:53:49.520]   I'm saying for Apple saying we this is what to me my take on it was Apple saying we're
[00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:51.320]   not a technology company.
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:53.120]   We're not a computer company.
[00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:55.840]   We've kind of written that horse as far as it's going to go.
[00:53:55.840 --> 00:53:59.040]   We're now a fashion company or a lifestyle brand.
[00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:04.400]   And that to me as a geek, that's like, well, the heck with that is I'm not going to buy
[00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:05.800]   Beats headphones either.
[00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:07.800]   But that's what culture is done with technology.
[00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:08.800]   I agree.
[00:54:08.800 --> 00:54:09.800]   It's gone.
[00:54:09.800 --> 00:54:11.800]   It's done now of the market.
[00:54:11.800 --> 00:54:13.400]   Look at Oakley, right?
[00:54:13.400 --> 00:54:14.400]   What is Oakley?
[00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:16.000]   Oakley is a lifestyle brand.
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:19.720]   And now they're putting technology in this lifestyle brand.
[00:54:19.720 --> 00:54:22.200]   That's why I find Oakley is doing is very interesting.
[00:54:22.200 --> 00:54:23.880]   I think it's a smart move for Apple.
[00:54:23.880 --> 00:54:29.120]   Well, Apple's been doing this kind of thing for fashion and technology for a long time.
[00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:33.600]   We'll just look at the way the iPhone looks and has looked from the beginning and the design
[00:54:33.600 --> 00:54:36.200]   of the MacBook Air and the MacBook Pro.
[00:54:36.200 --> 00:54:38.520]   They are, you know, people carry them their fashions.
[00:54:38.520 --> 00:54:40.520]   They've been fashion statements for a long time.
[00:54:40.520 --> 00:54:41.520]   Yeah.
[00:54:41.520 --> 00:54:43.880]   Pretty much the watch industry is really, really big.
[00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:49.040]   And forget, there are billions and billions of dollars spent on dumb watches.
[00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:51.840]   So how much are we going to spend on smart watches as the market grows?
[00:54:51.840 --> 00:54:52.840]   A lot.
[00:54:52.840 --> 00:54:58.120]   I would make a bet of somewhere around 50 million units in the first year.
[00:54:58.120 --> 00:55:02.040]   Well, and there's this audience of people that go to, you know, they buy at auction
[00:55:02.040 --> 00:55:06.000]   a watch for half a million dollars because it's super rare and collectible.
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:07.000]   Yeah.
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:09.920]   For those people to say, I'm going to spend four or five hundred dollars on an Apple watch
[00:55:09.920 --> 00:55:10.920]   is nothing.
[00:55:10.920 --> 00:55:11.920]   But I always do.
[00:55:11.920 --> 00:55:13.680]   Is witnessing the insanity of Western civilization.
[00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:14.680]   Are you wearing a watch?
[00:55:14.680 --> 00:55:15.680]   No, of course not.
[00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:16.680]   Are you wearing a watch?
[00:55:16.680 --> 00:55:17.680]   I'm not.
[00:55:17.680 --> 00:55:18.680]   Are you wearing a watch?
[00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:19.680]   I have a pocket watch.
[00:55:19.680 --> 00:55:20.680]   I like you feel band.
[00:55:20.680 --> 00:55:21.680]   How many, feel bands do that?
[00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:22.680]   Yeah.
[00:55:22.680 --> 00:55:23.680]   But both of those are more specific.
[00:55:23.680 --> 00:55:24.680]   I'm not going to watch.
[00:55:24.680 --> 00:55:26.320]   How many in our audience are wearing watches?
[00:55:26.320 --> 00:55:27.320]   One, two, three, four, five.
[00:55:27.320 --> 00:55:28.320]   Half the audience.
[00:55:28.320 --> 00:55:29.320]   Half the audience.
[00:55:29.320 --> 00:55:30.320]   Half the audience.
[00:55:30.320 --> 00:55:31.320]   We're watched for 20 years until.
[00:55:31.320 --> 00:55:32.320]   Six, seven.
[00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:33.320]   All right.
[00:55:33.320 --> 00:55:34.320]   The band.
[00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:35.320]   The band is awesome.
[00:55:35.320 --> 00:55:36.320]   Let me ask you this.
[00:55:36.320 --> 00:55:41.760]   What if, Chad, if you'll take my screen, the watch were gold.
[00:55:41.760 --> 00:55:46.080]   What is this you've got?
[00:55:46.080 --> 00:55:47.080]   Watch it.
[00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:48.560]   So it's good.
[00:55:48.560 --> 00:55:49.560]   Watch it.
[00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:52.880]   Can you name this product?
[00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:56.080]   I'm not the target audience for this product.
[00:55:56.080 --> 00:55:57.080]   Boiled beets.
[00:55:57.080 --> 00:55:58.080]   Oh, the gold iPhone.
[00:55:58.080 --> 00:55:59.080]   It's the gold iPhone.
[00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:00.080]   It's the gold iPhone.
[00:56:00.080 --> 00:56:01.080]   It's the gold iPhone.
[00:56:01.080 --> 00:56:02.080]   It's the gold iPhone.
[00:56:02.080 --> 00:56:03.080]   It's gold iPhone.
[00:56:03.080 --> 00:56:04.080]   It's gold iPhone.
[00:56:04.080 --> 00:56:05.080]   It's gold iPhone.
[00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:06.080]   It's gold iPhone.
[00:56:06.080 --> 00:56:07.080]   Here's something else.
[00:56:07.080 --> 00:56:08.080]   Here's something else.
[00:56:08.080 --> 00:56:09.080]   Apple's doing that you got to watch.
[00:56:09.080 --> 00:56:11.720]   They're sticking low energy Bluetooth beacons into the baseball parks.
[00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:13.720]   And do you know what these things are?
[00:56:13.720 --> 00:56:14.720]   It sounds painful.
[00:56:14.720 --> 00:56:15.720]   I don't know.
[00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:16.720]   Yes.
[00:56:16.720 --> 00:56:19.720]   The last time you were on, you were talking about putting these beacons in the Ritz-Carlton.
[00:56:19.720 --> 00:56:20.720]   They have me.
[00:56:20.720 --> 00:56:21.720]   Yeah, we are.
[00:56:21.720 --> 00:56:23.800]   These illegal beacons.
[00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:24.800]   Illegal beacons.
[00:56:24.800 --> 00:56:26.240]   And so as you walk around.
[00:56:26.240 --> 00:56:28.440]   This is using low energy.
[00:56:28.440 --> 00:56:29.440]   Low energy.
[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:31.400]   How many people have an iPhone with iOS 7?
[00:56:31.400 --> 00:56:32.760]   Oh, the same people.
[00:56:32.760 --> 00:56:35.760]   By the way, you are already carrying group.
[00:56:35.760 --> 00:56:39.960]   You're already, anybody who has iOS 7 on an iPhone is already carrying one of these low
[00:56:39.960 --> 00:56:40.960]   energy Bluetooth beacons.
[00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:41.960]   You've been the older iPhone.
[00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:42.960]   You've been the older iPhone.
[00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:43.960]   Yeah.
[00:56:43.960 --> 00:56:46.760]   And it spits an identifier into the air if you turn it on.
[00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:48.240]   Isn't that what you want?
[00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:49.240]   An identifier.
[00:56:49.240 --> 00:56:50.240]   So wherever you go.
[00:56:50.240 --> 00:56:51.240]   Yeah.
[00:56:51.240 --> 00:56:53.760]   So if anybody's eyes are actually shooting off.
[00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:56.160]   You know what it's going to do with the watch.
[00:56:56.160 --> 00:56:57.160]   Your watch is...
[00:56:57.160 --> 00:56:58.160]   No!
[00:56:58.160 --> 00:57:01.440]   You're going to get close to somebody and hang out with the three of us, right?
[00:57:01.440 --> 00:57:03.960]   And the color of the watch is going to start changing.
[00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:06.280]   So the gold is like a mood ring.
[00:57:06.280 --> 00:57:07.280]   It's fashion.
[00:57:07.280 --> 00:57:08.280]   It's fashion.
[00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:09.280]   It's fashion.
[00:57:09.280 --> 00:57:10.840]   You know what?
[00:57:10.840 --> 00:57:13.840]   All I got to say is fashion has done very well.
[00:57:13.840 --> 00:57:18.040]   People will buy a thousand dollar dress because the hemline changed an inch.
[00:57:18.040 --> 00:57:20.800]   This is not a bad thing from a commerce point of view.
[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:22.040]   But from a tech point of view.
[00:57:22.040 --> 00:57:25.800]   It's the end of the world.
[00:57:25.800 --> 00:57:28.160]   Google crosses a thousand dollars a share.
[00:57:28.160 --> 00:57:31.120]   It is now at $1,011 a share.
[00:57:31.120 --> 00:57:33.920]   All because of their quarterly results.
[00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:38.560]   The price per click slid again.
[00:57:38.560 --> 00:57:41.640]   In fact, a deeper drop this quarter than last quarter.
[00:57:41.640 --> 00:57:45.360]   But they're selling a lot more of them.
[00:57:45.360 --> 00:57:48.840]   They've got 41% of all digital ad revenue.
[00:57:48.840 --> 00:57:52.480]   53% of all mobile ad revenue.
[00:57:52.480 --> 00:57:55.640]   A very big quarter for Google.
[00:57:55.640 --> 00:58:00.280]   Revenue of $14.89 billion up 12% year over year.
[00:58:00.280 --> 00:58:05.560]   Net revenue $11.92 billion.
[00:58:05.560 --> 00:58:07.320]   That's $3 billion a month.
[00:58:07.320 --> 00:58:08.320]   It's not bad.
[00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:09.320]   Take it.
[00:58:09.320 --> 00:58:11.320]   I'm settled for that.
[00:58:11.320 --> 00:58:12.320]   Yeah.
[00:58:12.320 --> 00:58:16.160]   Well, and one of the reasons the stock price went up of course, they beat analysts expectations
[00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:18.080]   considerably.
[00:58:18.080 --> 00:58:20.600]   So a very good quarter for Google.
[00:58:20.600 --> 00:58:22.720]   Larry Page had such a good quarter.
[00:58:22.720 --> 00:58:25.800]   He said, I'm not going to do these analysts calls anymore.
[00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:30.120]   I've had enough.
[00:58:30.120 --> 00:58:35.000]   He said something like, you want me to do, use my time most efficiently.
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:36.000]   This is not it.
[00:58:36.000 --> 00:58:37.000]   See you.
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:38.000]   Well, good for him.
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:42.360]   But that shows how powerful he is now.
[00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:43.840]   He doesn't need to do these.
[00:58:43.840 --> 00:58:45.280]   He's turning in the power to use.
[00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:46.520]   Is his voice working yet?
[00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:47.520]   No, no, no.
[00:58:47.520 --> 00:58:48.520]   He has paralyzed vocal cords.
[00:58:48.520 --> 00:58:50.760]   So he's like a little bit like that.
[00:58:50.760 --> 00:58:52.560]   Yeah, it'll probably never recover.
[00:58:52.560 --> 00:58:53.960]   He had it as a kid.
[00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:56.360]   Oh, I didn't know that.
[00:58:56.360 --> 00:58:58.800]   It's harmless, but it makes you sound funny.
[00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:01.080]   It would be bad if it happened to me.
[00:59:01.080 --> 00:59:02.080]   But it--
[00:59:02.080 --> 00:59:04.080]   Not only it might be some better.
[00:59:04.080 --> 00:59:05.080]   Hey.
[00:59:05.080 --> 00:59:12.320]   People activate, get this, one and a half million Android devices a day.
[00:59:12.320 --> 00:59:13.880]   Yeah, that sounds good.
[00:59:13.880 --> 00:59:19.360]   Although, you can talk about another number in a second, there is definitely some support
[00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:24.200]   for the idea that people will use Android phones, use them as phones, not as computers.
[00:59:24.200 --> 00:59:26.920]   Yeah, talk about that in a second.
[00:59:26.920 --> 00:59:32.840]   It's a new Chinese phone that just sold a million years in a couple hours or so.
[00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:34.240]   Page Xiaomi.
[00:59:34.240 --> 00:59:35.240]   Xiaomi.
[00:59:35.240 --> 00:59:36.240]   Xiaomi.
[00:59:36.240 --> 00:59:37.240]   That's the one that--
[00:59:37.240 --> 00:59:38.240]   Is there an Android phone?
[00:59:38.240 --> 00:59:39.240]   Hugo Barra.
[00:59:39.240 --> 00:59:40.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:59:40.240 --> 00:59:41.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:59:41.240 --> 00:59:42.240]   Xiaomi.
[00:59:42.240 --> 00:59:43.240]   They're kicking butt in China.
[00:59:43.240 --> 00:59:44.240]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:59:44.240 --> 00:59:45.240]   Now, they're going to be player.
[00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:47.560]   I mean, I think they're going to come to the US and I think they're going to do well.
[00:59:47.560 --> 00:59:48.560]   It's fine.
[00:59:48.560 --> 00:59:49.560]   I'm at Google right now.
[00:59:49.560 --> 00:59:54.360]   I'm at their open source summit for folks that work on open source projects.
[00:59:54.360 --> 00:59:59.560]   And it is interesting that we went by the Android building where they have all the characters
[00:59:59.560 --> 01:00:02.640]   out front, the KitKat bar and the donut and whatever.
[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:04.680]   And there's people in that building right now.
[01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:07.160]   I mean, it's Sunday and that building is full.
[01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:08.160]   You bet.
[01:00:08.160 --> 01:00:09.160]   That's interesting.
[01:00:09.160 --> 01:00:10.760]   They don't go home.
[01:00:10.760 --> 01:00:12.240]   Nope.
[01:00:12.240 --> 01:00:13.240]   But what's interesting--
[01:00:13.240 --> 01:00:16.000]   It's kind of like the Roach Motel.
[01:00:16.000 --> 01:00:17.160]   They got free food.
[01:00:17.160 --> 01:00:18.160]   They got Segway ideas.
[01:00:18.160 --> 01:00:19.160]   They got--
[01:00:19.160 --> 01:00:20.160]   See, idea.
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:21.160]   They got--
[01:00:21.160 --> 01:00:22.160]   Oh, yeah.
[01:00:22.160 --> 01:00:23.160]   Pods.
[01:00:23.160 --> 01:00:24.160]   So you don't have bikes.
[01:00:24.160 --> 01:00:25.160]   You don't have to die there.
[01:00:25.160 --> 01:00:26.160]   Barbers.
[01:00:26.160 --> 01:00:27.160]   Barbers.
[01:00:27.160 --> 01:00:28.960]   So you don't have to get a haircut.
[01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:30.480]   They do your dry cleaning.
[01:00:30.480 --> 01:00:31.480]   You drop off your dry cleaning.
[01:00:31.480 --> 01:00:32.480]   Yep.
[01:00:32.480 --> 01:00:33.480]   They change your oil.
[01:00:33.480 --> 01:00:34.480]   They told us that.
[01:00:34.480 --> 01:00:35.480]   They get their oil change like somebody comes by and changes the oil.
[01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:36.480]   Even if you don't have a car.
[01:00:36.480 --> 01:00:38.480]   Is that a euphemism?
[01:00:38.480 --> 01:00:39.480]   No.
[01:00:39.480 --> 01:00:40.480]   Oh.
[01:00:40.480 --> 01:00:41.960]   You know, it might be, but I didn't ask.
[01:00:41.960 --> 01:00:43.480]   I was like, that's all I need to know.
[01:00:43.480 --> 01:00:44.480]   I'm good.
[01:00:44.480 --> 01:00:46.880]   I would think your self-driving car oil changed weekly now.
[01:00:46.880 --> 01:00:48.360]   I'll bet you do.
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:51.000]   Facebook ad profit.
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:55.000]   This is an interest-- a study by Nannigans.
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:01:00.800]   It sounds like a place you go on Friday afternoon to get a beer and some potato--
[01:01:00.800 --> 01:01:01.800]   It's a little changed.
[01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:03.440]   Maybe get your oil changed.
[01:01:03.440 --> 01:01:11.760]   Nannigans says that click-through rates on its Facebook ads are up 375%.
[01:01:11.760 --> 01:01:14.800]   Its overall return on investment is 152%.
[01:01:14.800 --> 01:01:24.360]   A study of more than 200 billion ads on Facebook says mobile ads on the iPhone generate 1,790%
[01:01:24.360 --> 01:01:27.320]   more return on investment than ads on Android.
[01:01:27.320 --> 01:01:28.320]   And this is part of it.
[01:01:28.320 --> 01:01:32.080]   I've heard this from several entrepreneurs.
[01:01:32.080 --> 01:01:34.360]   Apps make more money.
[01:01:34.360 --> 01:01:35.360]   Ads make more money.
[01:01:35.360 --> 01:01:36.360]   I believe this.
[01:01:36.360 --> 01:01:40.280]   All you have to do is walk into the first class section on a plane and you see mostly
[01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:42.600]   iPhones and that's why.
[01:01:42.600 --> 01:01:47.080]   Nannigans-- The rich people have iPhones and therefore they are the ones who monetize
[01:01:47.080 --> 01:01:48.080]   through ads.
[01:01:48.080 --> 01:01:52.080]   Well, and also, I think there's a lot of evidence that a lot of the Android phones
[01:01:52.080 --> 01:01:53.840]   in use are really just used as phones.
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:56.720]   Yeah, but they're not the first class users.
[01:01:56.720 --> 01:02:01.040]   The people who are in the first class and they throw off these stats, right?
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:03.040]   If you're a billionaire and you click on an ad and you buy a test--
[01:02:03.040 --> 01:02:04.400]   I'm still waiting for the Nexus 5.
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:09.640]   You throw off all the stats for the rest of us, right?
[01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:13.040]   What kind of card do you get?
[01:02:13.040 --> 01:02:14.040]   An Audi.
[01:02:14.040 --> 01:02:15.040]   An Audi.
[01:02:15.040 --> 01:02:18.640]   I had an Audi, but I got an Audi.
[01:02:18.640 --> 01:02:19.640]   What happened to your Mustang?
[01:02:19.640 --> 01:02:21.040]   He still has it.
[01:02:21.040 --> 01:02:22.200]   I still have that.
[01:02:22.200 --> 01:02:24.560]   No, Lisa drives that.
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:25.560]   But I thought--
[01:02:25.560 --> 01:02:26.560]   You got an 8.
[01:02:26.560 --> 01:02:27.560]   You know what happened?
[01:02:27.560 --> 01:02:28.560]   I got a little old--
[01:02:28.560 --> 01:02:34.240]   You didn't get like the cool 5 and it would be also a little less showy.
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:35.240]   This is not showy.
[01:02:35.240 --> 01:02:36.240]   It's a big 8.
[01:02:36.240 --> 01:02:37.240]   Those things were like huge.
[01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:38.240]   Did you get custom rims?
[01:02:38.240 --> 01:02:39.240]   Did you get custom rims?
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:41.240]   You got some limo-sized car.
[01:02:41.240 --> 01:02:43.240]   Did you get doves?
[01:02:43.240 --> 01:02:44.240]   No.
[01:02:44.240 --> 01:02:45.240]   It's stock.
[01:02:45.240 --> 01:02:46.240]   Stock.
[01:02:46.240 --> 01:02:48.240]   Well, stock is like-- that's an expensive car.
[01:02:48.240 --> 01:02:49.240]   Yeah, that is.
[01:02:49.240 --> 01:02:50.240]   What are you looking at me for?
[01:02:50.240 --> 01:02:51.240]   Well, congratulations.
[01:02:51.240 --> 01:02:52.240]   We're jealous.
[01:02:52.240 --> 01:02:53.240]   It's a nice car.
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:54.240]   Everybody thinks I should have bought a Tesla.
[01:02:54.240 --> 01:02:56.240]   I'm not going to buy an electric car yet.
[01:02:56.240 --> 01:02:57.240]   I hear car talking.
[01:02:57.240 --> 01:02:59.240]   It sounds to me like you were saying about fashion.
[01:02:59.240 --> 01:03:01.040]   I'm glad that's a big market.
[01:03:01.040 --> 01:03:02.240]   I understand it's an important product.
[01:03:02.240 --> 01:03:03.240]   I have no idea.
[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:04.240]   Right.
[01:03:04.240 --> 01:03:08.040]   And although the Audi has a ton of technology, it isn't like anywhere cutting edge.
[01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:13.320]   Although, it's kind of cool because in between my RPM and my speedometer, I have a heads-up
[01:03:13.320 --> 01:03:14.760]   display at night of pedestrian.
[01:03:14.760 --> 01:03:15.760]   Oh.
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:16.760]   So I can hit him a little bit.
[01:03:16.760 --> 01:03:17.760]   Yeah, you could like aim at him.
[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:18.760]   I can wing him.
[01:03:18.760 --> 01:03:19.760]   This is a good wing.
[01:03:19.760 --> 01:03:20.760]   I don't want to kill him.
[01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:21.760]   I used to be running him home.
[01:03:21.760 --> 01:03:22.760]   No, I just wing him.
[01:03:22.760 --> 01:03:23.760]   Yeah, I'm winging him.
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:24.760]   He's the way to go.
[01:03:24.760 --> 01:03:25.760]   And it's good way out coming.
[01:03:25.760 --> 01:03:28.000]   It really holds the road.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:29.000]   So you really got that.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:30.000]   You could just snare--
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:31.760]   You have the rear wheels that turn to.
[01:03:31.760 --> 01:03:32.760]   Oh, the whole thing.
[01:03:32.760 --> 01:03:33.760]   I don't know.
[01:03:33.760 --> 01:03:34.760]   It's great.
[01:03:34.760 --> 01:03:35.760]   It's only got three wheels.
[01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:39.720]   So the points you get when you hit them.
[01:03:39.720 --> 01:03:42.720]   It makes him need sound.
[01:03:42.720 --> 01:03:43.720]   So Leo, I've been--
[01:03:43.720 --> 01:03:44.720]   I've been screaming.
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:48.000]   --cars lately, looking at their tech, primarily looking at tech.
[01:03:48.000 --> 01:03:49.000]   Audi has a lot of tech.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:50.000]   And it has a lot of tech.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:51.000]   And it's a cheap car.
[01:03:51.000 --> 01:03:53.000]   In the $25,000 or less, and it's pretty--
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:54.000]   You can have that job.
[01:03:54.000 --> 01:03:55.000]   --you can have that job.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000]   You can have that job.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000]   Pretty impressed with the tech that you're having it.
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:00.680]   But everything I've looked at so far, the technology, the operating system, and the end
[01:04:00.680 --> 01:04:03.760]   dash, it keeps reminding me of Windows 98.
[01:04:03.760 --> 01:04:05.760]   Yeah, no, I feel like it's not there or not.
[01:04:05.760 --> 01:04:06.760]   I had a--
[01:04:06.760 --> 01:04:10.160]   But remember, the design cycle for cars is really slow compared to technology.
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:11.160]   Eight years.
[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:12.160]   Yeah.
[01:04:12.160 --> 01:04:13.160]   I've met the guy--
[01:04:13.160 --> 01:04:14.160]   Well, here's something interesting.
[01:04:14.160 --> 01:04:21.400]   The latest Kia Soul, the 2014 Kia Soul, which is hitting showrooms now, they have ditched
[01:04:21.400 --> 01:04:23.960]   the Microsoft operating system in it.
[01:04:23.960 --> 01:04:26.440]   I think it's similar to the one that Ford uses.
[01:04:26.440 --> 01:04:28.480]   And they're now using an Android-based operating system.
[01:04:28.480 --> 01:04:30.960]   Oh, see, I think that's the future, because it's free.
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:31.960]   Yes.
[01:04:31.960 --> 01:04:32.960]   Yes.
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:36.840]   And if you could add Android apps to it, that's something I'm very curious about.
[01:04:36.840 --> 01:04:39.560]   The app you have to leave is running Q and X by BlackBerry.
[01:04:39.560 --> 01:04:40.560]   Yeah.
[01:04:40.560 --> 01:04:41.960]   So that's going to go well.
[01:04:41.960 --> 01:04:42.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:46.960]   Now, that actually is the only thing in the BlackBerry app that's any good.
[01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:47.960]   Yeah.
[01:04:47.960 --> 01:04:48.960]   Has that even been--
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:50.960]   The BlackBerry has just been all the efforts going toward the car market.
[01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:51.960]   Check the keys on it.
[01:04:51.960 --> 01:04:52.960]   What's that?
[01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:55.960]   We have a little keyboard with the little checklet keys on it.
[01:04:55.960 --> 01:04:56.960]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:58.960]   Let's take a break.
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:02.160]   You know, Tom Merritt's been working all day putting this together.
[01:05:02.160 --> 01:05:04.160]   I really think we ought to pay close attention to--
[01:05:04.160 --> 01:05:05.160]   Tom?
[01:05:05.160 --> 01:05:06.160]   Tom?
[01:05:06.160 --> 01:05:07.160]   Is he here?
[01:05:07.160 --> 01:05:08.160]   Yeah.
[01:05:08.160 --> 01:05:09.160]   He's just over there.
[01:05:09.160 --> 01:05:10.160]   Tom, what's coming up on the week ahead?
[01:05:10.160 --> 01:05:11.160]   Thanks, Leo.
[01:05:11.160 --> 01:05:14.160]   Here's a look at some of the things we'll be keeping an eye on in the week ahead on Tech News today.
[01:05:14.160 --> 01:05:15.160]   Monday, October 21st.

[01:05:35.160 --> 01:05:37.160]   I don't know, something about tablets.
[01:05:37.160 --> 01:05:39.160]   Wednesday, October 23rd.
[01:05:39.160 --> 01:05:41.160]   AT&T has their earnings.

[01:05:55.160 --> 01:05:57.160]   Tech Crunch just rub kicks off in Europe.
[01:05:57.160 --> 01:06:02.160]   And the stop watching us rally against mass surveillance happens.
[01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:03.160]   That's a look at the week ahead.
[01:06:03.160 --> 01:06:04.160]   Back to you, Leo.
[01:06:04.160 --> 01:06:08.160]   Previously on Twitter, security now.
[01:06:08.160 --> 01:06:19.160]   The NSA has secret servers on the Internet that hack into other computers, code-named Fox acid.
[01:06:19.160 --> 01:06:20.160]   This week in Google.
[01:06:20.160 --> 01:06:22.160]   It's like there's a countdown to KitKat.
[01:06:22.160 --> 01:06:24.160]   The countdown is coming.
[01:06:24.160 --> 01:06:26.160]   We don't know what the countdown is.
[01:06:26.160 --> 01:06:28.160]   Coming soon, countdown.
[01:06:28.160 --> 01:06:31.160]   This is the most useless piece of information ever.
[01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:32.160]   Triagulation.
[01:06:32.160 --> 01:06:34.160]   This is Cast AR.
[01:06:34.160 --> 01:06:37.160]   Yes, this is projected augmented reality glasses.
[01:06:37.160 --> 01:06:39.160]   Wow.
[01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:40.160]   All about ankhling of media.
[01:06:40.160 --> 01:06:46.160]   KitKat's Google+ account is put up a little image of KitKat Guide, and it said everybody danced now.
[01:06:46.160 --> 01:06:47.160]   Okay, yeah.
[01:06:47.160 --> 01:06:48.160]   I'm feeling it.
[01:06:48.160 --> 01:06:49.160]   I'm feeling it.
[01:06:49.160 --> 01:06:50.160]   To it.
[01:06:50.160 --> 01:06:53.160]   It's like the screensabers in Silicon Spin had a baby.
[01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:55.160]   Hey!
[01:06:55.160 --> 01:06:56.160]   Hey!
[01:06:56.160 --> 01:06:57.160]   What is this?
[01:06:57.160 --> 01:06:58.160]   Summer!
[01:06:58.160 --> 01:07:00.160]   So, um...
[01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:04.160]   I forgot to mention the Nokia event.
[01:07:04.160 --> 01:07:06.160]   October 22nd is going to be a crazy day.
[01:07:06.160 --> 01:07:08.160]   Tom, remind me that there's a Nokia event on the same day.
[01:07:08.160 --> 01:07:09.160]   No, that's good timing.
[01:07:09.160 --> 01:07:12.160]   And that's what their eight-inch tablet or something.
[01:07:12.160 --> 01:07:14.160]   Surely they'll dominate the day's news.
[01:07:14.160 --> 01:07:17.160]   All over tech means crazy.
[01:07:17.160 --> 01:07:20.160]   It's all Nokia on tech and Nokia.
[01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:22.160]   What is that which is watched anyway?
[01:07:22.160 --> 01:07:23.160]   What's that?
[01:07:23.160 --> 01:07:25.160]   That was a house head.
[01:07:25.160 --> 01:07:26.160]   Why are you running house heads?
[01:07:26.160 --> 01:07:27.760]   You've got people that pay you money.
[01:07:27.760 --> 01:07:29.080]   You don't get anything.
[01:07:29.080 --> 01:07:32.400]   You get no compensation for running a house head.
[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:34.560]   And they're a symbol.
[01:07:34.560 --> 01:07:36.560]   They're a sign of desperation.
[01:07:36.560 --> 01:07:39.160]   Could be worse, I could be running public service announcements.
[01:07:39.160 --> 01:07:40.960]   No, I thought that was great.
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:42.160]   That gave me a great overview.
[01:07:42.160 --> 01:07:44.080]   Like, I always intend to watch all the shows.
[01:07:44.080 --> 01:07:45.080]   I don't get all the shows.
[01:07:45.080 --> 01:07:46.320]   I was like, "Oh, that was good."
[01:07:46.320 --> 01:07:47.320]   And I mean, like...
[01:07:47.320 --> 01:07:48.320]   Thank you.
[01:07:48.320 --> 01:07:50.320]   Gina is on two of those shows and she's my co-founder.
[01:07:50.320 --> 01:07:52.080]   I didn't catch all of the clips yet.
[01:07:52.080 --> 01:07:54.680]   You got to watch her on this weekend Google and all about Android.
[01:07:54.680 --> 01:07:55.680]   I know.
[01:07:55.680 --> 01:07:56.680]   She's really good.
[01:07:56.680 --> 01:07:57.680]   She's amazing.
[01:07:57.680 --> 01:07:58.680]   She's amazing.
[01:07:58.680 --> 01:08:00.080]   Who doesn't love Gina Trapani?
[01:08:00.080 --> 01:08:01.080]   I mean, she's really...
[01:08:01.080 --> 01:08:02.080]   You'd have to be a monster.
[01:08:02.080 --> 01:08:03.080]   Yeah.
[01:08:03.080 --> 01:08:04.080]   You're a horrendous, horrible person.
[01:08:04.080 --> 01:08:05.080]   We will do live...
[01:08:05.080 --> 01:08:06.080]   Captain John Monster.
[01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:13.640]   We won't be doing live coverage of the midnight Microsoft Store openings for Surface 2.
[01:08:13.640 --> 01:08:15.560]   We probably won't be doing live coverage.
[01:08:15.560 --> 01:08:17.080]   This is a big disappointment.
[01:08:17.080 --> 01:08:18.080]   I know.
[01:08:18.080 --> 01:08:19.080]   You're not keeping out.
[01:08:19.080 --> 01:08:20.080]   I'm not giving up all that.
[01:08:20.080 --> 01:08:21.080]   I think I'm all there.
[01:08:21.080 --> 01:08:23.080]   I'm not doing live coverage.
[01:08:23.080 --> 01:08:25.080]   All the traffic you could have had.
[01:08:25.080 --> 01:08:27.080]   3 AM Nokia announcements.
[01:08:27.080 --> 01:08:31.400]   There's at least 50 people in the world who are totally pissed at you.
[01:08:31.400 --> 01:08:39.220]   I will be up at 9.30 AM promptly to do at 9.30 Pacific, 12.30 Eastern time to do our 10
[01:08:39.220 --> 01:08:41.000]   o'clock Apple event.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:44.200]   I don't know yet if Apple's going to stream the last time they were at her, but boy in
[01:08:44.200 --> 01:08:45.960]   the center, they did stream.
[01:08:45.960 --> 01:08:46.960]   So we're hoping they'll stream.
[01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:52.640]   If they do, we'll carry the stream and then we'll put silhouettes of our heads in front
[01:08:52.640 --> 01:08:54.840]   of it as we comment on the...
[01:08:54.840 --> 01:08:58.280]   Our pretty sure is going to be new iPads and possibly a new macro.
[01:08:58.280 --> 01:09:00.080]   I'm not going to go.
[01:09:00.080 --> 01:09:02.600]   No, I'm speaking to the Consumer Electronics Association.
[01:09:02.600 --> 01:09:03.600]   Oh, that'll be fun.
[01:09:03.600 --> 01:09:04.600]   Where's that in Vegas?
[01:09:04.600 --> 01:09:05.600]   No, Southern California.
[01:09:05.600 --> 01:09:06.600]   Southern California.
[01:09:06.600 --> 01:09:07.600]   Los Angeles.
[01:09:07.600 --> 01:09:08.600]   And Neil, you were saying something.
[01:09:08.600 --> 01:09:09.600]   I'm sorry.
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:12.600]   No, I say you promised to wake up at 12.30 New York Times.
[01:09:12.600 --> 01:09:13.600]   Which is...
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:14.600]   That's a bold statement.
[01:09:14.600 --> 01:09:15.600]   I'll wake up a little afternoon.
[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:16.600]   I don't get up early.
[01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:17.600]   That's my commitment.
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:19.440]   I don't get up early from Microsoft.
[01:09:19.440 --> 01:09:20.440]   No, I...
[01:09:20.440 --> 01:09:21.440]   No, I should.
[01:09:21.440 --> 01:09:23.440]   Windows 9, I might.
[01:09:23.440 --> 01:09:26.360]   I'll reserve the right to do that.
[01:09:26.360 --> 01:09:27.360]   What do you...
[01:09:27.360 --> 01:09:29.080]   Apple says we have a lot to cover.
[01:09:29.080 --> 01:09:30.720]   A lot of people looked at that invite.
[01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:35.600]   You had it there a second ago, Chad, and it looks like the Peacock, the NBC Peacock,
[01:09:35.600 --> 01:09:37.520]   was shot in the tail.
[01:09:37.520 --> 01:09:40.160]   So my guess is that this is all about...
[01:09:40.160 --> 01:09:42.320]   No, it's not has nothing to do with NBC.
[01:09:42.320 --> 01:09:45.680]   Well, usually in their titles, they put a little hint of what's coming.
[01:09:45.680 --> 01:09:46.680]   So colorful covers.
[01:09:46.680 --> 01:09:51.560]   No, if they say they have a lot to cover, maybe this screen really goes edge to edge and they
[01:09:51.560 --> 01:09:53.200]   have to put a new kind of cover on it.
[01:09:53.200 --> 01:09:55.120]   Oh, you're really stretching on it.
[01:09:55.120 --> 01:09:56.520]   I don't know.
[01:09:56.520 --> 01:09:58.320]   I think it's time travel.
[01:09:58.320 --> 01:10:01.720]   Yeah, wouldn't it be fun to get somebody from the future back here and tell us?
[01:10:01.720 --> 01:10:03.120]   Are they going to bring the watch out?
[01:10:03.120 --> 01:10:04.120]   No.
[01:10:04.120 --> 01:10:05.120]   They won't show the watch.
[01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:06.120]   They won't mention the watch.
[01:10:06.120 --> 01:10:07.120]   There will be no watch.
[01:10:07.120 --> 01:10:09.440]   They will not mention Apple TV, even though people think they will.
[01:10:09.440 --> 01:10:10.440]   I think that's...
[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:11.440]   It's such a small...
[01:10:11.440 --> 01:10:12.760]   By the way, I heard you're right.
[01:10:12.760 --> 01:10:16.240]   I heard the TV products slip to mark.
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:17.240]   It's too small a product.
[01:10:17.240 --> 01:10:18.600]   They can't get the networks to join in.
[01:10:18.600 --> 01:10:20.360]   It's just not going anywhere.
[01:10:20.360 --> 01:10:25.120]   I do think they may surprise people with a lack of a retina iPad update.
[01:10:25.120 --> 01:10:26.120]   I really...
[01:10:26.120 --> 01:10:27.120]   The mini...
[01:10:27.120 --> 01:10:28.120]   That's my idea.
[01:10:28.120 --> 01:10:30.280]   I'm afraid will not be retina, but it's my fear.
[01:10:30.280 --> 01:10:32.320]   Why would you buy a new mini then?
[01:10:32.320 --> 01:10:33.320]   Well, because...
[01:10:33.320 --> 01:10:35.160]   And this is what I think has to do with the...
[01:10:35.160 --> 01:10:36.160]   They're going to be like the 5C.
[01:10:36.160 --> 01:10:37.800]   They're going to have color backs.
[01:10:37.800 --> 01:10:39.400]   Now how much would you pay?
[01:10:39.400 --> 01:10:40.400]   Wow.
[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:43.080]   I know why I'm not going.
[01:10:43.080 --> 01:10:44.080]   I hope this is...
[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:46.520]   What could you do to update the iPad?
[01:10:46.520 --> 01:10:48.880]   I think they're going to put a retinomini out there.
[01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:49.880]   Come on.
[01:10:49.880 --> 01:10:52.280]   There'll be a retinomini, but you'll still be able to buy the non-retinomini and it'll
[01:10:52.280 --> 01:10:53.280]   be like $199.
[01:10:53.280 --> 01:10:56.440]   You know, Apple never does that.
[01:10:56.440 --> 01:10:57.440]   Never...
[01:10:57.440 --> 01:10:58.440]   I don't think they're...
[01:10:58.440 --> 01:10:59.440]   No, they do.
[01:10:59.440 --> 01:11:00.440]   They do.
[01:11:00.440 --> 01:11:01.440]   But that's different because it's...
[01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:03.200]   They're subsidizing that through this.
[01:11:03.200 --> 01:11:04.200]   There's more comments.
[01:11:04.200 --> 01:11:05.200]   And they have done it with their eye...
[01:11:05.200 --> 01:11:07.760]   With the full-size iPad, they've made the previous generation...
[01:11:07.760 --> 01:11:08.760]   They did do that.
[01:11:08.760 --> 01:11:09.760]   ...or less expensive.
[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:10.760]   It was $100 less.
[01:11:10.760 --> 01:11:14.840]   And they'll do that with this, I think.
[01:11:14.840 --> 01:11:16.920]   The only product I'm hoping for is a Mac Mini.
[01:11:16.920 --> 01:11:18.120]   I've got a Mac Mini.
[01:11:18.120 --> 01:11:19.120]   It's long in the tooth.
[01:11:19.120 --> 01:11:21.120]   I'm like, "That's a great product."
[01:11:21.120 --> 01:11:22.120]   And I'm not going to buy the $10,000.
[01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:23.120]   They did.
[01:11:23.120 --> 01:11:24.520]   They did not.
[01:11:24.520 --> 01:11:30.120]   So last October 23rd, last year, they updated everything that they hadn't updated, everything
[01:11:30.120 --> 01:11:31.120]   but the iPhone.
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:33.520]   You know what we haven't mentioned?
[01:11:33.520 --> 01:11:35.720]   This is traditionally the iPod announcement.
[01:11:35.720 --> 01:11:38.240]   Does you think they'll update the iPod?
[01:11:38.240 --> 01:11:39.240]   No.
[01:11:39.240 --> 01:11:40.240]   They did.
[01:11:40.240 --> 01:11:41.240]   It's dead.
[01:11:41.240 --> 01:11:42.240]   Yeah, there's nothing left.
[01:11:42.240 --> 01:11:43.240]   There's the product of the...
[01:11:43.240 --> 01:11:46.800]   You know, that was killing them all five years ago.
[01:11:46.800 --> 01:11:49.920]   And they obsely did it themselves.
[01:11:49.920 --> 01:11:51.320]   I bet they will update the Mini.
[01:11:51.320 --> 01:11:53.680]   They'll do a Haswell Mini.
[01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:54.680]   I don't...
[01:11:54.680 --> 01:11:56.360]   I guess the touch is retina now, right?
[01:11:56.360 --> 01:11:57.520]   The iPod touch.
[01:11:57.520 --> 01:11:58.520]   Yes.
[01:11:58.520 --> 01:11:59.520]   Yes.
[01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:00.520]   So there's nothing...
[01:12:00.520 --> 01:12:01.520]   Yeah, I mean, we don't even know.
[01:12:01.520 --> 01:12:03.520]   You could put a better camera in it.
[01:12:03.520 --> 01:12:05.320]   If this group of dudes doesn't know...
[01:12:05.320 --> 01:12:08.160]   Will they do a fingerprint sensor in the big iPad?
[01:12:08.160 --> 01:12:09.160]   I think they ought to.
[01:12:09.160 --> 01:12:10.160]   I would have seen it.
[01:12:10.160 --> 01:12:11.160]   I would have seen it.
[01:12:11.160 --> 01:12:12.160]   Eventually, but probably not now.
[01:12:12.160 --> 01:12:13.160]   Probably because it's not.
[01:12:13.160 --> 01:12:14.160]   I bricked it.
[01:12:14.160 --> 01:12:18.120]   All you have to do if you want to unlock it, just put it on that Motorola sticker right
[01:12:18.120 --> 01:12:19.920]   there and unlocks it.
[01:12:19.920 --> 01:12:20.920]   Ooh!
[01:12:20.920 --> 01:12:22.160]   And FC.
[01:12:22.160 --> 01:12:26.160]   No, I should never have shown it on that.
[01:12:26.160 --> 01:12:33.800]   So the Chevy, the 2014 Chevy Camaro, Volt and Malibu will be talking Siri.
[01:12:33.800 --> 01:12:37.160]   Siri, they call it Eyes Free.
[01:12:37.160 --> 01:12:38.160]   Eyes Free.
[01:12:38.160 --> 01:12:39.160]   What do you mean?
[01:12:39.160 --> 01:12:40.160]   It's a bad name.
[01:12:40.160 --> 01:12:41.160]   Your eyes are very bad.
[01:12:41.160 --> 01:12:42.160]   Very bad name.
[01:12:42.160 --> 01:12:43.160]   It's a jinx.
[01:12:43.160 --> 01:12:44.160]   It's a curse.
[01:12:44.160 --> 01:12:45.160]   I have a Siri button in my car.
[01:12:45.160 --> 01:12:46.160]   Do you have a BMW?
[01:12:46.160 --> 01:12:47.160]   No, no.
[01:12:47.160 --> 01:12:48.160]   It's a little button.
[01:12:48.160 --> 01:12:49.160]   He drives a little button?
[01:12:49.160 --> 01:12:51.160]   Honda said it's going to do it in 2013 models.
[01:12:51.160 --> 01:12:52.160]   BMW is doing it.
[01:12:52.160 --> 01:12:54.240]   It's not as good as the Moto X though.
[01:12:54.240 --> 01:12:55.480]   Is this like AirPlay?
[01:12:55.480 --> 01:12:57.240]   Like you can send the music and stuff through it?
[01:12:57.240 --> 01:12:58.240]   No, no.
[01:12:58.240 --> 01:13:04.320]   You talk to the phone through the Chevy MyLink service and you can get it in the phone.
[01:13:04.320 --> 01:13:08.120]   It's basically a button on the dash that turns on Siri so you can talk about it.
[01:13:08.120 --> 01:13:09.120]   Hello, Siri.
[01:13:09.120 --> 01:13:10.840]   Oh, okay.
[01:13:10.840 --> 01:13:13.680]   So automotive, holla, Neil.
[01:13:13.680 --> 01:13:14.680]   Right.
[01:13:14.680 --> 01:13:16.360]   Yeah, okay.
[01:13:16.360 --> 01:13:22.960]   Most of the cars now that have Bluetooth have some kind of voice recognition and they're
[01:13:22.960 --> 01:13:24.520]   terrible.
[01:13:24.520 --> 01:13:29.680]   If this improves that, if this essentially takes care of the voice recognition in a car,
[01:13:29.680 --> 01:13:34.960]   not that Siri is great, iOS 7 version is a lot better, but it certainly would beat what's
[01:13:34.960 --> 01:13:37.600]   in cars now because most of it is awful.
[01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:39.800]   I have a nice German lady in my car.
[01:13:39.800 --> 01:13:41.520]   She said, "What would you like?"
[01:13:41.520 --> 01:13:42.520]   Is that right?
[01:13:42.520 --> 01:13:43.520]   No.
[01:13:43.520 --> 01:13:45.520]   I wish it were though.
[01:13:45.520 --> 01:13:48.680]   I still take third party voices as the way to go on these things.
[01:13:48.680 --> 01:13:51.760]   You know, on my Tom's, Tom, I had Arnold Schwartz and that guy would tell you to do
[01:13:51.760 --> 01:13:53.600]   a turtle right here.
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:58.880]   And then the best one though was Glados, you know, from the Portal Games and she would
[01:13:58.880 --> 01:14:00.880]   lie to you.
[01:14:00.880 --> 01:14:02.880]   So take a ride.
[01:14:02.880 --> 01:14:05.400]   She would say, take a ride here.
[01:14:05.400 --> 01:14:08.880]   And then when she would say, "There's cake waiting for you."
[01:14:08.880 --> 01:14:11.400]   It was great, but it was not useful because...
[01:14:11.400 --> 01:14:13.400]   No, you get lost or killed.
[01:14:13.400 --> 01:14:14.400]   I've never gotten to have anything.
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:15.400]   The worst could happen.
[01:14:15.400 --> 01:14:18.400]   You could buy a voice and you could get Snoop Dogg and he would give you directions.
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:19.400]   Yeah.
[01:14:19.400 --> 01:14:21.160]   It's like, yeah, turn left on this drizzly.
[01:14:21.160 --> 01:14:23.160]   I think some old grandma'd be funnier.
[01:14:23.160 --> 01:14:26.040]   I had Dennis Hopper's voice for a while.
[01:14:26.040 --> 01:14:28.040]   And he was like, "Oh man."
[01:14:28.040 --> 01:14:31.040]   He'd say, "You've arrived at your destination.
[01:14:31.040 --> 01:14:33.800]   Why would anyone want to go here?"
[01:14:33.800 --> 01:14:35.800]   Tom Tom really owned that.
[01:14:35.800 --> 01:14:36.800]   Yeah, great.
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:37.800]   It was great.
[01:14:37.800 --> 01:14:39.800]   I don't know what happened.
[01:14:39.800 --> 01:14:43.800]   Was it an imitation or was it an actual voice?
[01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:45.600]   Well, God, I don't know.
[01:14:45.600 --> 01:14:46.600]   It could have been Dennis Hopper's.
[01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:47.600]   It sounded just like him.
[01:14:47.600 --> 01:14:49.600]   It'd be nice giving him a little money.
[01:14:49.600 --> 01:14:52.600]   One of them was selling the real thing with the celebrity.
[01:14:52.600 --> 01:14:53.600]   He did.
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:58.000]   Tom Tom was selling real celebrity voices, but they were also doing some impersonations.
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:15:00.000]   All right.
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:01.000]   Yeah.
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:06.000]   Any truth to this, according to 9 to 5, Google, Google Watch is coming.
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:07.000]   Yeah.
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:09.520]   KitKat, Google Now functionality built into a watch.
[01:15:09.520 --> 01:15:12.320]   Well, Google bought a company called Win Labs, W-I-M-M.
[01:15:12.320 --> 01:15:13.320]   W-I-M, yeah.
[01:15:13.320 --> 01:15:19.320]   And they built a platform for wearables and that's rumors.
[01:15:19.320 --> 01:15:20.320]   Yeah.
[01:15:20.320 --> 01:15:21.320]   It's common.
[01:15:21.320 --> 01:15:23.120]   It would be called Gem.
[01:15:23.120 --> 01:15:25.600]   It's a Nexus watch.
[01:15:25.600 --> 01:15:29.160]   The rumors are that it might come out with a KitKat announcement, which is later this
[01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:30.360]   month.
[01:15:30.360 --> 01:15:32.560]   So that's Android 4.4.
[01:15:32.560 --> 01:15:37.840]   So that would be very interesting if they jumped the gun on Apple and offered a Google
[01:15:37.840 --> 01:15:38.840]   Watch.
[01:15:38.840 --> 01:15:39.840]   Yeah.
[01:15:39.840 --> 01:15:40.840]   Let's be honest.
[01:15:40.840 --> 01:15:41.840]   Apple's going to clean up.
[01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:42.840]   Are they?
[01:15:42.840 --> 01:15:43.840]   Yeah.
[01:15:43.840 --> 01:15:44.840]   I mean, the rush to market is not the way to go.
[01:15:44.840 --> 01:15:47.800]   When I hear Apple has a beautiful product coming out.
[01:15:47.800 --> 01:15:50.040]   But we'll have Arnold Schwarzenegger's voice.
[01:15:50.040 --> 01:15:51.680]   And Google has no distribution.
[01:15:51.680 --> 01:15:54.000]   Where are you going to buy a Google Watch?
[01:15:54.000 --> 01:15:55.640]   Apple has stores, right?
[01:15:55.640 --> 01:15:58.320]   And we're going to wait in line for them.
[01:15:58.320 --> 01:16:00.320]   Yeah, not only that, if you're a fashion product, you want to know.
[01:16:00.320 --> 01:16:01.320]   I'll wait in line for an Apple.
[01:16:01.320 --> 01:16:02.320]   Right.
[01:16:02.320 --> 01:16:04.920]   If you're going to spend hundreds of dollars on an external product, you want to put it
[01:16:04.920 --> 01:16:07.560]   on your wrist and show it off and say, how does this look before you do it?
[01:16:07.560 --> 01:16:09.040]   A watch should be fashionable.
[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:10.200]   That's the only people buy watch.
[01:16:10.200 --> 01:16:11.760]   Well, I shouldn't say that.
[01:16:11.760 --> 01:16:15.440]   But many of the people buy watches buy them as fashion statements now.
[01:16:15.440 --> 01:16:16.440]   So I have to read real now.
[01:16:16.440 --> 01:16:17.440]   Yeah.
[01:16:17.440 --> 01:16:20.120]   I think a lot of these newer smart watches are super ugly.
[01:16:20.120 --> 01:16:21.120]   They're not just a little bit ugly.
[01:16:21.120 --> 01:16:22.120]   I haven't done anything.
[01:16:22.120 --> 01:16:23.440]   They are super ugly.
[01:16:23.440 --> 01:16:25.600]   The Samsung watches are the gear.
[01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:27.400]   It's actually fun to function.
[01:16:27.400 --> 01:16:29.840]   It's got a camera on it.
[01:16:29.840 --> 01:16:30.840]   You've got a touchscreen.
[01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:33.160]   It still looks like an engineer built it.
[01:16:33.160 --> 01:16:35.440]   Well, yeah, but that's because an engineer built it.
[01:16:35.440 --> 01:16:39.840]   I don't think they need to put an hour hand on it because the battery doesn't last that
[01:16:39.840 --> 01:16:40.840]   long.
[01:16:40.840 --> 01:16:42.840]   Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[01:16:42.840 --> 01:16:43.840]   Do we?
[01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:45.760]   No, that's not OK.
[01:16:45.760 --> 01:16:46.760]   Is that right?
[01:16:46.760 --> 01:16:47.760]   Is that true?
[01:16:47.760 --> 01:16:48.760]   No, no, no.
[01:16:48.760 --> 01:16:49.760]   It's like a three hour.
[01:16:49.760 --> 01:16:50.760]   No, no, no.
[01:16:50.760 --> 01:16:52.400]   Somebody mentioned the Galaxy gear right here.
[01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:54.600]   Somebody mentioned the pair is just really clunky.
[01:16:54.600 --> 01:16:57.360]   You know, it's like, yeah, look straight at it.
[01:16:57.360 --> 01:16:58.360]   Yeah.
[01:16:58.360 --> 01:17:06.760]   It reminds me of-- remember the original pulsar watches, the red LED watches from the '70s
[01:17:06.760 --> 01:17:08.440]   when they were first digital watches?
[01:17:08.440 --> 01:17:09.720]   I have one of them.
[01:17:09.720 --> 01:17:11.800]   I have a fair child.
[01:17:11.800 --> 01:17:12.800]   Does it work?
[01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:13.800]   Yeah.
[01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:14.800]   It's just great.
[01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:15.800]   You got it.
[01:17:15.800 --> 01:17:19.240]   Those were the days when you had to show it off because it was a fashion item.
[01:17:19.240 --> 01:17:23.520]   You'd have to lift your arm up and then push the button and then the time would show up
[01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:24.520]   in red.
[01:17:24.520 --> 01:17:25.520]   Remember that?
[01:17:25.520 --> 01:17:26.520]   That's all the Galaxy gear.
[01:17:26.520 --> 01:17:28.080]   You have to lift it up and press the button.
[01:17:28.080 --> 01:17:31.720]   I had the Casio calculator watch for you.
[01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:34.520]   I got that thing at a garage sale.
[01:17:34.520 --> 01:17:35.520]   Somebody was just sitting there.
[01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:38.240]   I think the gear would have cleaned up in 1982.
[01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:39.240]   Maybe.
[01:17:39.240 --> 01:17:40.240]   Oh, yeah.
[01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:43.040]   Anyway, so Dave, Mac, something.
[01:17:43.040 --> 01:17:44.600]   I mentioned the Pebble.
[01:17:44.600 --> 01:17:47.200]   And I think the Pebble is the winner today.
[01:17:47.200 --> 01:17:48.520]   But I think the gears--
[01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:49.520]   I think the cable--
[01:17:49.520 --> 01:17:52.880]   Well, everybody who's seen this Apple, I watch say, uh-uh.
[01:17:52.880 --> 01:17:54.720]   Pebble is not going to be the watch.
[01:17:54.720 --> 01:17:55.720]   How much will the Apple--
[01:17:55.720 --> 01:17:58.040]   And also, Pebble doesn't have a brand that normal people know.
[01:17:58.040 --> 01:17:59.040]   Anything about it?
[01:17:59.040 --> 01:18:03.040]   This is-- even if you had just the functionality of Pebble, but you were curved glass, you would
[01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:04.040]   win.
[01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:05.040]   But how much?
[01:18:05.040 --> 01:18:06.040]   500 bucks?
[01:18:06.040 --> 01:18:07.040]   400 bucks?
[01:18:07.040 --> 01:18:08.040]   300 bucks?
[01:18:08.040 --> 01:18:09.040]   I don't know.
[01:18:09.040 --> 01:18:10.040]   350?
[01:18:10.040 --> 01:18:11.040]   I don't know.
[01:18:11.040 --> 01:18:12.040]   399?
[01:18:12.040 --> 01:18:13.040]   I think 399.
[01:18:13.040 --> 01:18:14.040]   400.
[01:18:14.040 --> 01:18:15.040]   Yeah, it could be 400.
[01:18:15.040 --> 01:18:17.040]   If it does very little and doesn't have too many sensors in it, doesn't need a lot of compute,
[01:18:17.040 --> 01:18:18.040]   you know, 299, 350.
[01:18:18.040 --> 01:18:19.040]   Yeah.
[01:18:19.040 --> 01:18:21.800]   Keep in mind it's not going to be subsidized because it's not a phone.
[01:18:21.800 --> 01:18:23.040]   Right.
[01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:24.040]   So it has to come out.
[01:18:24.040 --> 01:18:25.040]   Will it require a phone?
[01:18:25.040 --> 01:18:26.040]   Will it require a phone?
[01:18:26.040 --> 01:18:27.040]   Yes.
[01:18:27.040 --> 01:18:28.040]   Yeah, they could.
[01:18:28.040 --> 01:18:29.040]   I mean, there's no reason because Apple has a phone.
[01:18:29.040 --> 01:18:31.040]   It'll have low energy Bluetooth that I can talk to.
[01:18:31.040 --> 01:18:32.040]   It'll work with the iPhone.
[01:18:32.040 --> 01:18:33.040]   It talks back and forth to the--
[01:18:33.040 --> 01:18:34.040]   But it'll only work with an iPhone.
[01:18:34.040 --> 01:18:35.040]   It probably should be a dropout.
[01:18:35.040 --> 01:18:37.040]   It'll probably only work with iPhone 5 because it'll low energy, right?
[01:18:37.040 --> 01:18:38.040]   Yeah.
[01:18:38.040 --> 01:18:39.040]   Right.
[01:18:39.040 --> 01:18:40.040]   Right.
[01:18:40.040 --> 01:18:41.040]   You'll have a decent--
[01:18:41.040 --> 01:18:42.040]   Well, you know--
[01:18:42.040 --> 01:18:44.040]   The 4S, if you want all the features.
[01:18:44.040 --> 01:18:46.120]   And the 5 works with the watch.
[01:18:46.120 --> 01:18:48.040]   I think the 5 has low energy.
[01:18:48.040 --> 01:18:49.640]   You don't think you need a 5S.
[01:18:49.640 --> 01:18:51.040]   I think you need a 5, though.
[01:18:51.040 --> 01:18:54.040]   Yeah, I think a 5 is where Bluetooth 4 came in.
[01:18:54.040 --> 01:18:55.040]   Okay.
[01:18:55.040 --> 01:18:56.040]   Our show today brought to you by our friends at Citrix.
[01:18:56.040 --> 01:18:59.040]   Citrix, go ahead.
[01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:00.040]   Mr. David's right.
[01:19:00.040 --> 01:19:01.040]   4S had low energy Bluetooth.
[01:19:01.040 --> 01:19:02.040]   4S, too.
[01:19:02.040 --> 01:19:05.040]   But the newer phones have a little bit better radio.
[01:19:05.040 --> 01:19:07.040]   I remember it.
[01:19:07.040 --> 01:19:08.040]   Low, low energy.
[01:19:08.040 --> 01:19:10.040]   Lower energy.
[01:19:10.040 --> 01:19:14.280]   Our show today brought to you by our friends at Citrix who do go to meeting the most powerful
[01:19:14.280 --> 01:19:17.680]   online and most popular online meeting software out there.
[01:19:17.680 --> 01:19:21.040]   You could share the same screen with the clients and colleagues.
[01:19:21.040 --> 01:19:24.040]   It's-- you know, meetings happen.
[01:19:24.040 --> 01:19:25.960]   That's my new bumper sticker.
[01:19:25.960 --> 01:19:26.960]   Things happen.
[01:19:26.960 --> 01:19:33.320]   A last minute opportunity, a work emergency, or maybe-- and Lisa does this, our CEO.
[01:19:33.320 --> 01:19:36.960]   If more than five emails go back and forth on a topic, she says, "That's it."
[01:19:36.960 --> 01:19:40.960]   We're getting in the same room because we're wasting time going dithering.
[01:19:40.960 --> 01:19:42.960]   That's what meetings are great for.
[01:19:42.960 --> 01:19:43.960]   They can cut through it.
[01:19:43.960 --> 01:19:45.960]   If they're done right, they can be very efficient.
[01:19:45.960 --> 01:19:46.960]   Go to meeting means.
[01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:50.960]   You can meet with people everywhere on the road, all over the country, all over the world.
[01:19:50.960 --> 01:19:54.960]   Quickly, efficiently, effectively, you're seeing the same screen.
[01:19:54.960 --> 01:19:58.600]   HD faces, you're seeing each other, so it's like meeting in person.
[01:19:58.600 --> 01:19:59.920]   You can now try go to meeting.
[01:19:59.920 --> 01:20:01.360]   You don't need a credit card.

[01:20:28.320 --> 01:20:29.320]   That's a...
[01:20:29.320 --> 01:20:30.320]   You know what?
[01:20:30.320 --> 01:20:31.320]   I'm really thrilled that they did that.
[01:20:31.320 --> 01:20:33.200]   We actually said, "Make this easy.
[01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:35.160]   Just let them sign up.
[01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:36.160]   Don't ask for any of them.
[01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:37.160]   Just let them sign up."
[01:20:37.160 --> 01:20:38.320]   And they said, "Okay."
[01:20:38.320 --> 01:20:41.080]   So all you need is the offer code TWIT.
[01:20:41.080 --> 01:20:43.080]   G-O-T-O meeting.com.
[01:20:43.080 --> 01:20:45.080]   Meeting is believing.
[01:20:45.080 --> 01:20:46.080]   Okay.
[01:20:46.080 --> 01:20:50.400]   We kind of think we said everything there is to say about Apple.
[01:20:50.400 --> 01:20:57.280]   According to Verizon, 51% of smartphone activations are now iPhones.
[01:20:57.280 --> 01:21:01.800]   What do we think about the sales of the 5S versus the 5C?
[01:21:01.800 --> 01:21:04.160]   No surprise, I think.
[01:21:04.160 --> 01:21:09.520]   I don't think anybody thought that the 5C would take off.
[01:21:09.520 --> 01:21:16.480]   And I'm surprised, Apple, that they've had to kind of re-jigger their production between
[01:21:16.480 --> 01:21:17.480]   one to the other.
[01:21:17.480 --> 01:21:21.160]   I think they should have had the 5S production level higher all along.
[01:21:21.160 --> 01:21:24.480]   I think they were hoping maybe in developing countries there would be more interest.
[01:21:24.480 --> 01:21:26.440]   But it's just not that interesting a phone.
[01:21:26.440 --> 01:21:32.720]   John Patchkowski in All Things D says the iPhone 5S, the high end is outselling the color
[01:21:32.720 --> 01:21:35.760]   low end 2 to 1.
[01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:37.440]   You know, I think these things are relative though, right?
[01:21:37.440 --> 01:21:39.160]   That's within Apple's universe.
[01:21:39.160 --> 01:21:46.080]   I think a 5C probably outsells any individual Android phone except for maybe the top end
[01:21:46.080 --> 01:21:49.040]   of the Galaxy.
[01:21:49.040 --> 01:21:50.480]   So it's a relative thing.
[01:21:50.480 --> 01:21:54.640]   It's like a failure for Apple as a success for almost everybody else.
[01:21:54.640 --> 01:21:58.960]   Well, it's a failure of their supply chain because they have kind of misallocated, I
[01:21:58.960 --> 01:22:01.240]   think, their supply resources.
[01:22:01.240 --> 01:22:06.840]   John says it's not selling much better than the 4S did when the 4S became the legacy iPhone
[01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:08.960]   with the release of the 5.
[01:22:08.960 --> 01:22:09.960]   Which makes sense, right?
[01:22:09.960 --> 01:22:12.080]   It's not that big of a big of a second choice.
[01:22:12.080 --> 01:22:14.480]   It's not that big of a jump over the 5, right?
[01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:18.640]   I mean, I have a 5S and if I wasn't in the business, I wouldn't have thought of it.
[01:22:18.640 --> 01:22:19.720]   The fingerprint's pretty awesome.
[01:22:19.720 --> 01:22:22.440]   I like it, but it's not the killer feature that makes people...
[01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:24.400]   Now, the screen's the same, the form factor's the same.
[01:22:24.400 --> 01:22:25.400]   Yeah, it's gold.
[01:22:25.400 --> 01:22:26.400]   The speed's a little faster.
[01:22:26.400 --> 01:22:27.400]   It's faster.
[01:22:27.400 --> 01:22:31.120]   It has the motion sensor that very little software uses yet.
[01:22:31.120 --> 01:22:34.840]   So the average person on the street is like, whatever.
[01:22:34.840 --> 01:22:37.440]   That would sound like John C. Devorik.
[01:22:37.440 --> 01:22:39.000]   A little bit.
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:40.000]   Whatever.
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:41.920]   Well, that's usually the case for the S series.
[01:22:41.920 --> 01:22:43.080]   They're usually...
[01:22:43.080 --> 01:22:44.080]   Usually a...
[01:22:44.080 --> 01:22:45.080]   Yeah, whatever kind of phone.
[01:22:45.080 --> 01:22:46.680]   It's a marginal upgrade, yeah.
[01:22:46.680 --> 01:22:52.000]   Right, but it'll be real, but my suspicion is, I think most people who watch Apple think
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:57.480]   that with the 6, you'll actually have a substantial size increase and that'll be the next killer
[01:22:57.480 --> 01:22:58.480]   feature.
[01:22:58.480 --> 01:22:59.480]   I think it'll go to close to a high-level.
[01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:03.720]   I wonder how they're going to view that because the whole OS is...
[01:23:03.720 --> 01:23:06.560]   Every pixel on the screen is set down.
[01:23:06.560 --> 01:23:08.720]   It's not an expandable...
[01:23:08.720 --> 01:23:10.800]   The developers don't...
[01:23:10.800 --> 01:23:13.560]   It's not a scalable screen.
[01:23:13.560 --> 01:23:17.600]   So are they going to force developers to build on the apps for a 6-inch screen?
[01:23:17.600 --> 01:23:18.600]   It's like, "Hmm."
[01:23:18.600 --> 01:23:21.040]   Well, they did with making the iPhone 5 taller.
[01:23:21.040 --> 01:23:22.040]   Yeah, but they had the power tag.
[01:23:22.040 --> 01:23:23.040]   They had the power tag.
[01:23:23.040 --> 01:23:24.040]   They had the power tag.
[01:23:24.040 --> 01:23:25.040]   They did with the right now.
[01:23:25.040 --> 01:23:26.040]   The developers are going to be like...
[01:23:26.040 --> 01:23:28.040]   Are iPhone users complaining about the size?
[01:23:28.040 --> 01:23:29.040]   Some are.
[01:23:29.040 --> 01:23:30.040]   If you have one...
[01:23:30.040 --> 01:23:31.040]   I think the size things are red-haring.
[01:23:31.040 --> 01:23:32.040]   I think you might be right.
[01:23:32.040 --> 01:23:33.040]   I think you might be right.
[01:23:33.040 --> 01:23:35.160]   I think it was a market for big phones, but it hasn't hurt them any.
[01:23:35.160 --> 01:23:38.520]   I don't think anybody's like, "I would buy an iPhone if the screen were a little bit
[01:23:38.520 --> 01:23:39.520]   bigger.
[01:23:39.520 --> 01:23:42.520]   Either you want an iPhone or you don't."
[01:23:42.520 --> 01:23:43.520]   Yeah.
[01:23:43.520 --> 01:23:45.920]   So we're switching to Samsung now.
[01:23:45.920 --> 01:23:49.520]   Well, Moto X is about the same size, but Samsung...
[01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:51.520]   This is a 4.7, any of the other...
[01:23:51.520 --> 01:23:55.120]   Which is notably bigger than the iPhone or the...
[01:23:55.120 --> 01:23:56.160]   Yeah, you get the little...
[01:23:56.160 --> 01:23:58.160]   It's only 720p.
[01:23:58.160 --> 01:23:59.160]   It's not.
[01:23:59.160 --> 01:24:03.000]   So it's a little bit lower res than the iPhone.
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:05.120]   The iPhone went to 4-inches.
[01:24:05.120 --> 01:24:06.760]   There was a lot of speculation.
[01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:14.960]   So will developers follow?
[01:24:14.960 --> 01:24:18.240]   No matter what Apple does with it, the developers will do it.
[01:24:18.240 --> 01:24:22.760]   They'll make much more interesting apps as a result of having more screen real estate.
[01:24:22.760 --> 01:24:24.760]   Where's that HTC One of yours anyway?
[01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:25.760]   I'm just wondering.
[01:24:25.760 --> 01:24:27.360]   Oh, I was going to give that to you.
[01:24:27.360 --> 01:24:28.360]   Yeah.
[01:24:28.360 --> 01:24:29.360]   Shoot, I left it home.
[01:24:29.360 --> 01:24:30.360]   Oh.
[01:24:30.360 --> 01:24:31.360]   No, you can have it.
[01:24:31.360 --> 01:24:32.360]   I don't care.
[01:24:32.360 --> 01:24:33.360]   I'm taking it.
[01:24:33.360 --> 01:24:34.360]   It's good.
[01:24:34.360 --> 01:24:35.360]   It's a nice phone.
[01:24:35.360 --> 01:24:37.480]   You know, that's a good looking phone.
[01:24:37.480 --> 01:24:39.400]   After the show, come home with me.
[01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:40.640]   Excuse me?
[01:24:40.640 --> 01:24:45.160]   And I'll give it to you.
[01:24:45.160 --> 01:24:46.160]   Seriously.
[01:24:46.160 --> 01:24:47.160]   All right, I'll take it.
[01:24:47.160 --> 01:24:48.160]   It's just sitting on the shelf waiting for you.
[01:24:48.160 --> 01:24:49.160]   Well, there you have it.
[01:24:49.160 --> 01:24:51.240]   No, I'm waiting for the Nexus 5.
[01:24:51.240 --> 01:24:52.960]   I like pure Google.
[01:24:52.960 --> 01:24:56.680]   And I've eventually given up on the Galaxy S4 and the HTC One.
[01:24:56.680 --> 01:24:59.800]   The Moto X is pure enough, but I like...
[01:24:59.800 --> 01:25:03.720]   Android's good enough now that I don't think you need those customizations.
[01:25:03.720 --> 01:25:05.840]   I'm not the Samsung stuffs crap.
[01:25:05.840 --> 01:25:08.240]   And if it's going to put me off the Note 3, which you know whatever I like.
[01:25:08.240 --> 01:25:09.800]   I have a Samsung, but it's a Google.
[01:25:09.800 --> 01:25:10.800]   Yeah, you want the Note 3?
[01:25:10.800 --> 01:25:11.800]   It's a wonderful phone.
[01:25:11.800 --> 01:25:15.960]   Yeah, but I don't like all the touch whiz stuff.
[01:25:15.960 --> 01:25:18.760]   Yeah, it's overburdened with crap.
[01:25:18.760 --> 01:25:19.760]   It's...
[01:25:19.760 --> 01:25:21.680]   It's got a golf mode in the camera.
[01:25:21.680 --> 01:25:22.680]   Come on!
[01:25:22.680 --> 01:25:25.080]   Yes, what does that even mean?
[01:25:25.080 --> 01:25:27.920]   There's a golf swing mode in the camera.
[01:25:27.920 --> 01:25:28.920]   What does that even mean?
[01:25:28.920 --> 01:25:32.120]   Well, you take a picture of your golf swing and it shows every position.
[01:25:32.120 --> 01:25:33.120]   Oh, it's...
[01:25:33.120 --> 01:25:37.360]   It's wasting megabytes of my already skimpy storage phone.
[01:25:37.360 --> 01:25:38.360]   I don't want it.
[01:25:38.360 --> 01:25:39.200]   I always like the Nexus.
[01:25:39.200 --> 01:25:43.000]   The Nexus experience is better, but they're almost impossible to buy for almost any phone.
[01:25:43.000 --> 01:25:44.000]   My wife was always...
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:45.360]   She was a die-hard Android user.
[01:25:45.360 --> 01:25:49.240]   Got the Nexus, you know, all the way from the G1 through the 1.
[01:25:49.240 --> 01:25:51.200]   All these different products at Nexus S.
[01:25:51.200 --> 01:25:54.320]   And then eventually it was so hard to just buy a Nexus phone.
[01:25:54.320 --> 01:25:55.560]   She's like, "I just want to buy the...
[01:25:55.560 --> 01:25:56.800]   Go to the store, buy the phone."
[01:25:56.800 --> 01:25:59.600]   Well, you go to play.google.com and you click on the phone.
[01:25:59.600 --> 01:26:00.600]   And I'm on Verizon.
[01:26:00.600 --> 01:26:02.320]   I'm a Verizon guy and I will not use it.
[01:26:02.320 --> 01:26:04.400]   I will not use AT&T.
[01:26:04.400 --> 01:26:05.760]   No, no, no, you want T-Mobile.
[01:26:05.760 --> 01:26:06.760]   You know why?
[01:26:06.760 --> 01:26:07.760]   They have free international rolling.
[01:26:07.760 --> 01:26:09.760]   T-Mobile doesn't work in my house, man.
[01:26:09.760 --> 01:26:11.760]   T-Mobile is great.
[01:26:11.760 --> 01:26:12.760]   T-Mobile is there.
[01:26:12.760 --> 01:26:13.760]   I love T-Mobile.
[01:26:13.760 --> 01:26:17.040]   It doesn't work in Half Men Bay, which is sort of where I live.
[01:26:17.040 --> 01:26:19.040]   So it's sort of a non-stirring.
[01:26:19.040 --> 01:26:20.040]   Yeah, that's right.
[01:26:20.040 --> 01:26:21.040]   It also...
[01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:22.040]   It also...
[01:26:22.040 --> 01:26:23.040]   It also...
[01:26:23.040 --> 01:26:25.600]   It also doesn't work very well inside buildings.
[01:26:25.600 --> 01:26:27.440]   I would love to switch to T-Mobile.
[01:26:27.440 --> 01:26:30.720]   I can see a big window from my desk.
[01:26:30.720 --> 01:26:37.120]   And if I have a T-Mobile review phone, it's about maybe 1% of the time I can get signal
[01:26:37.120 --> 01:26:39.200]   off of it from in Downtown Houston.
[01:26:39.200 --> 01:26:40.600]   They've really got to be the case.
[01:26:40.600 --> 01:26:43.760]   They've got to spend some money and prove their physical plan.
[01:26:43.760 --> 01:26:46.400]   I mean, for somebody who travels internationally, the fact that...
[01:26:46.400 --> 01:26:50.000]   I know it's only Edge, but the fact that you get free international roaming, I got
[01:26:50.000 --> 01:26:54.080]   my AT&T bill from my three-week trip to Italy and Italy and Greece and Turkey.
[01:26:54.080 --> 01:26:55.080]   It was $1,000.
[01:26:55.080 --> 01:26:56.880]   Yeah, a chip.
[01:26:56.880 --> 01:26:57.880]   And I just...
[01:26:57.880 --> 01:26:58.880]   You know, I would love to have that...
[01:26:58.880 --> 01:26:59.880]   I don't care if it's Edge.
[01:26:59.880 --> 01:27:00.880]   That's fine.
[01:27:00.880 --> 01:27:02.600]   I just need a little bit of access.
[01:27:02.600 --> 01:27:04.080]   A little bit.
[01:27:04.080 --> 01:27:05.800]   Yeah, and that's a...
[01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:10.320]   So this is the Play Store accidentally put up an ad for the Nexus 5, which looks to be
[01:27:10.320 --> 01:27:11.920]   another great phone.
[01:27:11.920 --> 01:27:16.160]   It's from LG, 350 bucks for 16 gigabytes.
[01:27:16.160 --> 01:27:20.400]   That's half what comparable phones like the HTC One cost.
[01:27:20.400 --> 01:27:24.520]   I think these are dynamite phones.
[01:27:24.520 --> 01:27:26.320]   But it's delayed.
[01:27:26.320 --> 01:27:31.400]   I don't know if it's because the FCC was closed or what, but it's delayed.
[01:27:31.400 --> 01:27:36.280]   I'm not waiting for 4-4 KitKat and the Google Watch and the Nexus 4.
[01:27:36.280 --> 01:27:41.200]   Maybe they'll have a big announcement on October 22nd because that day is pretty well open,
[01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:42.200]   I think.
[01:27:42.200 --> 01:27:44.880]   I think we should do our own press conference.
[01:27:44.880 --> 01:27:45.880]   If you were...
[01:27:45.880 --> 01:27:46.880]   I just...
[01:27:46.880 --> 01:27:47.880]   Okay, watch carefully.
[01:27:47.880 --> 01:27:54.120]   If there's a politician with a Twitter scandal or anything going on that you want to bury,
[01:27:54.120 --> 01:27:58.160]   10 AM Tuesday and now it's it to the world.
[01:27:58.160 --> 01:27:59.160]   Yeah.
[01:27:59.160 --> 01:28:00.160]   Right?
[01:28:00.160 --> 01:28:01.160]   Yeah, that's the way to go.
[01:28:01.160 --> 01:28:02.160]   It's just us.
[01:28:02.160 --> 01:28:03.160]   That's only for us nerds.
[01:28:03.160 --> 01:28:04.160]   Yeah, the real world.
[01:28:04.160 --> 01:28:05.960]   CNN is still going to report on the Wiener gate.
[01:28:05.960 --> 01:28:09.200]   Yeah, CNN, they're going to say the end of the show.
[01:28:09.200 --> 01:28:11.200]   By the way, there was a new talent from Apple.
[01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:12.680]   Go cut away for 30 seconds.
[01:28:12.680 --> 01:28:14.440]   Yeah, yeah, that's it.
[01:28:14.440 --> 01:28:15.440]   I hate living in the world.
[01:28:15.440 --> 01:28:16.440]   Sex scandals are the real story to them.
[01:28:16.440 --> 01:28:17.440]   They really are.
[01:28:17.440 --> 01:28:19.120]   Well, they're a story to all of us.
[01:28:19.120 --> 01:28:22.880]   It's interesting that there's more satellite tracks than Apple press conference than any
[01:28:22.880 --> 01:28:23.880]   other technology companies.
[01:28:23.880 --> 01:28:24.880]   It is.
[01:28:24.880 --> 01:28:26.880]   It's pretty amazing.
[01:28:26.880 --> 01:28:27.880]   Twitter's going to the public.
[01:28:27.880 --> 01:28:31.040]   I'm glad to see they're going to list in the stock, New York Stock Exchange and they're
[01:28:31.040 --> 01:28:33.080]   not going to use TWIT TWIT.
[01:28:33.080 --> 01:28:35.000]   So you still can.
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:36.000]   I'm relieved.
[01:28:36.000 --> 01:28:38.240]   Yeah, I still can when I go public.
[01:28:38.240 --> 01:28:39.920]   TWTR will be there.
[01:28:39.920 --> 01:28:41.200]   Yeah, I don't get that.
[01:28:41.200 --> 01:28:42.200]   That's stock tonight.
[01:28:42.200 --> 01:28:43.200]   What?
[01:28:43.200 --> 01:28:44.200]   Why did they use TWIT?
[01:28:44.200 --> 01:28:48.120]   They wanted the R. They want that R.
[01:28:48.120 --> 01:28:49.720]   Well, it's also close to their original name.
[01:28:49.720 --> 01:28:51.720]   Remember, they didn't have the vowels when they launched.
[01:28:51.720 --> 01:28:52.720]   They were TWTR.
[01:28:52.720 --> 01:28:53.720]   So they wanted to get to know.
[01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:59.760]   I am leaving in the dream world that the Twitter folks knew about TWIT and didn't want
[01:28:59.760 --> 01:29:01.800]   to be mean.
[01:29:01.800 --> 01:29:03.600]   They certainly know about TWIT.
[01:29:03.600 --> 01:29:06.320]   They know about TWIT because we predated them.
[01:29:06.320 --> 01:29:08.800]   They were a podcasting company before they did TWITTER.
[01:29:08.800 --> 01:29:11.080]   Evan Williams told me, yeah, we knew about TWIT.
[01:29:11.080 --> 01:29:13.640]   We just didn't think either Twitter or TWIT was going anywhere.
[01:29:13.640 --> 01:29:14.640]   Right.
[01:29:14.640 --> 01:29:15.640]   Yeah, which is fair.
[01:29:15.640 --> 01:29:16.640]   Which is fair.
[01:29:16.640 --> 01:29:17.640]   They were right about one of them.
[01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:20.840]   They both took office unlikely.
[01:29:20.840 --> 01:29:22.920]   So let's talk about Dick Costolo.
[01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:23.920]   You got...
[01:29:23.920 --> 01:29:29.400]   I don't know what you are champion of the disenfranchised, all of a sudden.
[01:29:29.400 --> 01:29:30.480]   You know, not really.
[01:29:30.480 --> 01:29:31.480]   It's really simple.
[01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:34.000]   We're all like, we want everybody to have a fair shot.
[01:29:34.000 --> 01:29:36.000]   I don't know if there's anything complicated to it.
[01:29:36.000 --> 01:29:39.760]   And I known Dick a dozen years more than that.
[01:29:39.760 --> 01:29:46.280]   Since he had a startup back in '99 called Spy On It, which a few old-timers will remind
[01:29:46.280 --> 01:29:49.600]   and remember, what it did is it would send you an instant message when your favorite
[01:29:49.600 --> 01:29:51.640]   website updated.
[01:29:51.640 --> 01:29:52.640]   If that sounds familiar.
[01:29:52.640 --> 01:29:54.240]   No, I don't remember at all.
[01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:56.280]   It was a great startup based out of Chicago.
[01:29:56.280 --> 01:30:02.480]   Of course, the .coms collapsed back in 2001 and they ended up selling to some enterprise
[01:30:02.480 --> 01:30:03.480]   company.
[01:30:03.480 --> 01:30:04.480]   But that was where we connected.
[01:30:04.480 --> 01:30:08.920]   A lot of early blogs, I remember Boeing Boeing used to have a Spy On It button.
[01:30:08.920 --> 01:30:14.240]   Follow us on Spy On It and you'll get an AOL instant messenger update when we update.
[01:30:14.240 --> 01:30:15.240]   So that was cool.
[01:30:15.240 --> 01:30:16.240]   And that was where we connected.
[01:30:16.240 --> 01:30:17.880]   And I've known Dick a long time.
[01:30:17.880 --> 01:30:21.080]   And other folks on the Twitter board have Williams, other folks like that.
[01:30:21.080 --> 01:30:26.160]   And I think they are and have been working earnestly to get women on the board.
[01:30:26.160 --> 01:30:28.600]   And then there's a New York Times story about, hey, they don't have any women on the board.
[01:30:28.600 --> 01:30:30.760]   And I think the majority of Twitter users are women.
[01:30:30.760 --> 01:30:31.760]   So that makes sense.
[01:30:31.760 --> 01:30:34.160]   So there's nothing complicated about that.
[01:30:34.160 --> 01:30:42.280]   The New York Times story quoted an academicific, Wadwa, saying Twitter's imbalance was elite
[01:30:42.280 --> 01:30:46.400]   arrogance in the same male chauvinistic thinking that permeates Silicon Valley.
[01:30:46.400 --> 01:30:51.400]   And I think Costala's response was, Wadwa was the carrot top of academic sources.
[01:30:51.400 --> 01:30:52.400]   Yeah.
[01:30:52.400 --> 01:30:54.400]   And I think, you know, Vivek is a firebrand.
[01:30:54.400 --> 01:30:59.840]   And like any time you're an advocate, like you need somebody who's going to be, you know,
[01:30:59.840 --> 01:31:03.160]   all in, just the radical kind of, you know, pound in their fist.
[01:31:03.160 --> 01:31:04.320]   And I think Vivek is that guy.
[01:31:04.320 --> 01:31:07.400]   And I appreciate him doing it.
[01:31:07.400 --> 01:31:10.920]   What's, and it's sort of like, you know what, if you're all going to be billionaires anyway,
[01:31:10.920 --> 01:31:12.640]   like you can take a little bit of criticism.
[01:31:12.640 --> 01:31:17.000]   But I was surprised by knowing Dick a long time was that he would go with the sort of,
[01:31:17.000 --> 01:31:18.160]   you know, Vivek is carrot top.
[01:31:18.160 --> 01:31:23.920]   It's like either the legitimate, the criticism is legitimate or it's not, but I don't like
[01:31:23.920 --> 01:31:29.400]   that guy is sort of unrelated to the concept of, well, does it make sense to have a woman
[01:31:29.400 --> 01:31:30.880]   on the board of Twitter?
[01:31:30.880 --> 01:31:36.080]   So you tweeted sorely disappointed to see Dick respond defensively to criticisms of industry
[01:31:36.080 --> 01:31:37.080]   sexism.
[01:31:37.080 --> 01:31:38.640]   Why not just lead as Twitter does on free speech?
[01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:39.640]   And that's true.
[01:31:39.640 --> 01:31:40.640]   They've really laid on that.
[01:31:40.640 --> 01:31:43.480]   They're great on free speech, they're great on patents, they're great on a whole bunch
[01:31:43.480 --> 01:31:44.480]   of other issues.
[01:31:44.480 --> 01:31:47.880]   I think they've got incredible women who are executives at the company, like a Katie Stanton
[01:31:47.880 --> 01:31:51.160]   who heads up international or a close lad in new heads up media.
[01:31:51.160 --> 01:31:52.160]   They're incredible.
[01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:54.160]   So like, you know, the company is good at this overall.
[01:31:54.160 --> 01:31:56.440]   And it's just like, you don't need to be defensive about this.
[01:31:56.440 --> 01:31:57.720]   I think if you know,
[01:31:57.720 --> 01:32:01.240]   Solo responded to you, he says I was making fun because Stalin was a comedian.
[01:32:01.240 --> 01:32:02.240]   I didn't know this.
[01:32:02.240 --> 01:32:05.080]   Yeah, that's why I believe he was a stand up comic.
[01:32:05.080 --> 01:32:09.360]   He thought that this was hilarious to use a carrot top reference because most comics
[01:32:09.360 --> 01:32:11.680]   think very lowly of carrot top.
[01:32:11.680 --> 01:32:16.520]   People forget, I think a lot in Twitter, they use Twitter in a little slapdash offhand fashion,
[01:32:16.520 --> 01:32:18.160]   even its own CEO.
[01:32:18.160 --> 01:32:20.000]   And they forget that everybody's watching.
[01:32:20.000 --> 01:32:21.000]   Yeah.
[01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:24.320]   You know, and I think that that's the kind of thing you'd say maybe on a panel like this.
[01:32:24.320 --> 01:32:25.320]   Right.
[01:32:25.320 --> 01:32:26.320]   Where nobody's watching.
[01:32:26.320 --> 01:32:27.320]   Nobody's watching.
[01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:28.320]   Where you can also get the context.
[01:32:28.320 --> 01:32:30.520]   No, where you can get the context.
[01:32:30.520 --> 01:32:31.520]   Right.
[01:32:31.520 --> 01:32:36.000]   Well, it is different too, where I think that the, if Dick had said that to me, I would
[01:32:36.000 --> 01:32:38.040]   have gotten it as funny because we know it's a very long time.
[01:32:38.040 --> 01:32:40.000]   I don't think he knows of the back.
[01:32:40.000 --> 01:32:42.080]   Personally, I don't know, but I don't think he does.
[01:32:42.080 --> 01:32:44.000]   And certainly, yeah, I mean, Dick is really funny.
[01:32:44.000 --> 01:32:45.200]   He's not like a little bit funny.
[01:32:45.200 --> 01:32:46.680]   He's like professional grade funny.
[01:32:46.680 --> 01:32:50.880]   He was on Second City with, you know, Amy Poehler and Tina Fey and, you know, folks
[01:32:50.880 --> 01:32:51.880]   that are household names.
[01:32:51.880 --> 01:32:52.880]   Like he was right.
[01:32:52.880 --> 01:32:56.680]   Why did he give up the career to run this company?
[01:32:56.680 --> 01:32:59.080]   I bet he probably makes a little more money than those folks.
[01:32:59.080 --> 01:33:00.080]   Yeah.
[01:33:00.080 --> 01:33:01.080]   Interesting idea.
[01:33:01.080 --> 01:33:03.880]   Also, if I could make people laugh, I would never run a company.
[01:33:03.880 --> 01:33:05.720]   Yeah, well, that'll be the day.
[01:33:05.720 --> 01:33:10.440]   It wasn't because Stola also feed burner.
[01:33:10.440 --> 01:33:11.840]   Didn't he start feed burn?
[01:33:11.840 --> 01:33:12.840]   Oh, really?
[01:33:12.840 --> 01:33:13.840]   I didn't know that.
[01:33:13.840 --> 01:33:14.840]   Yeah.
[01:33:14.840 --> 01:33:15.840]   Yeah.
[01:33:15.840 --> 01:33:18.080]   So yeah, I mean, that's the team that did spy on it sold that company.
[01:33:18.080 --> 01:33:23.000]   They however long they had to sit in the enterprise company sold that to as soon as they left,
[01:33:23.000 --> 01:33:26.560]   they started feed burner, which they said, let's try this real time delivery of information
[01:33:26.560 --> 01:33:27.560]   again.
[01:33:27.560 --> 01:33:29.280]   And that got by Google.
[01:33:29.280 --> 01:33:32.440]   And then they, you know, and then Dick left there.
[01:33:32.440 --> 01:33:36.680]   And now he's like at Twitter, he started COO working on real time delivery of information
[01:33:36.680 --> 01:33:37.680]   again.
[01:33:37.680 --> 01:33:39.240]   This is the obsession for all these two.
[01:33:39.240 --> 01:33:45.080]   So what shocks me is that carrot top on his account, he has not tweeted in response
[01:33:45.080 --> 01:33:46.080]   in any way.
[01:33:46.080 --> 01:33:49.320]   He did an interview where he said like, why is this real account?
[01:33:49.320 --> 01:33:51.200]   It's a tweet.
[01:33:51.200 --> 01:33:52.760]   I think there's a deeper.
[01:33:52.760 --> 01:33:54.680]   He's so pumped up he can't actually get you.
[01:33:54.680 --> 01:34:01.040]   I think there's a deeper problem with which is finding some board of directors are directional
[01:34:01.040 --> 01:34:02.040]   things.
[01:34:02.040 --> 01:34:06.440]   You want to change your company and your company is going that way and you want to change it
[01:34:06.440 --> 01:34:07.440]   to go that way.
[01:34:07.440 --> 01:34:12.600]   You have to put new board members that have the skills to drive you this way.
[01:34:12.600 --> 01:34:19.520]   And you know, we've been thinking a lot about this and it's really hard to say you need,
[01:34:19.520 --> 01:34:25.240]   let's say, really hardcore mobile talent, somebody who's built a mobile company.
[01:34:25.240 --> 01:34:30.760]   And the women who are in that space who are really good candidates are fully booked and
[01:34:30.760 --> 01:34:33.680]   fully and it's really hard.
[01:34:33.680 --> 01:34:35.120]   Time came up with 25 people.
[01:34:35.120 --> 01:34:36.120]   Now we've found a few.
[01:34:36.120 --> 01:34:37.640]   But they're they're hard.
[01:34:37.640 --> 01:34:38.640]   It is a hard problem.
[01:34:38.640 --> 01:34:41.200]   You know, that's actually I think broadly that's true.
[01:34:41.200 --> 01:34:44.720]   So the difference is what Twitter is going to be the hottest IPO of the year.
[01:34:44.720 --> 01:34:46.040]   They are a household name.
[01:34:46.040 --> 01:34:47.320]   They're an important tech company.
[01:34:47.320 --> 01:34:48.320]   They're not struggling.
[01:34:48.320 --> 01:34:49.480]   Like they're there.
[01:34:49.480 --> 01:34:53.200]   Should there be more women candidates who are able to participate in boards?
[01:34:53.200 --> 01:34:54.200]   Yes.
[01:34:54.200 --> 01:34:55.200]   There.
[01:34:55.200 --> 01:34:56.200]   But the that's not the issue for Twitter.
[01:34:56.200 --> 01:34:58.440]   Whoever they ask is going to say yes.
[01:34:58.440 --> 01:34:59.440]   So that's that's actually not.
[01:34:59.440 --> 01:35:00.760]   Binders full of women.
[01:35:00.760 --> 01:35:02.160]   There's not binders.
[01:35:02.160 --> 01:35:03.160]   Right.
[01:35:03.160 --> 01:35:06.720]   And the bigger thing is for them to communicate about we're on it.
[01:35:06.720 --> 01:35:07.720]   This is important.
[01:35:07.720 --> 01:35:10.760]   You know, we respect this issue and we're paying attention to it.
[01:35:10.760 --> 01:35:11.760]   Yeah.
[01:35:11.760 --> 01:35:15.040]   That's what I don't get is why they don't just say that because I'm sure 100% sure that's
[01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:16.040]   true.
[01:35:16.040 --> 01:35:19.560]   If they just said we're working on it and we're going to talk about it well, we can.
[01:35:19.560 --> 01:35:22.400]   He just made an offhand comment forgetting that other people read Twitter.
[01:35:22.400 --> 01:35:23.400]   Yeah.
[01:35:23.400 --> 01:35:26.360]   And you said something interesting, which I think is probably true is that the majority
[01:35:26.360 --> 01:35:27.880]   of users on Twitter are women.
[01:35:27.880 --> 01:35:28.880]   Yeah.
[01:35:28.880 --> 01:35:31.800]   It's like 51% or is it larger?
[01:35:31.800 --> 01:35:34.640]   I think it's 53, there was a peer report on this.
[01:35:34.640 --> 01:35:35.680]   I have to look at the numbers.
[01:35:35.680 --> 01:35:39.160]   But you know, this was true in the early days from the early days of blogging.
[01:35:39.160 --> 01:35:40.360]   This is true on Facebook.
[01:35:40.360 --> 01:35:42.480]   This is true on obviously Pinterest.
[01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:44.280]   This is true on Twitter.
[01:35:44.280 --> 01:35:47.240]   You know, it's across the board.
[01:35:47.240 --> 01:35:50.560]   Women are more active in social media and spend more.
[01:35:50.560 --> 01:35:55.480]   You know, I always had a conference called Focus 100 and the stat on stage was that no
[01:35:55.480 --> 01:36:00.880]   group spends more through mobile on products and no sort of individual demographic spends
[01:36:00.880 --> 01:36:07.280]   more on mobile spending than black women in America.
[01:36:07.280 --> 01:36:08.280]   Wow.
[01:36:08.280 --> 01:36:09.280]   Like stunning to me.
[01:36:09.280 --> 01:36:11.000]   That is a surprise, isn't it?
[01:36:11.000 --> 01:36:13.000]   And it's just there's probably just Oprah.
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:17.440]   No, I think I joke see now if I had said that on Twitter, I'd be in trouble.
[01:36:17.440 --> 01:36:18.440]   Oh, yeah.
[01:36:18.440 --> 01:36:19.440]   Yeah.
[01:36:19.440 --> 01:36:20.440]   No, you're in trouble now.
[01:36:20.440 --> 01:36:21.440]   Yeah.
[01:36:21.440 --> 01:36:22.440]   Yeah.
[01:36:22.440 --> 01:36:27.600]   So it's like people there are there are groups that really, really use the media really well
[01:36:27.600 --> 01:36:30.040]   and and women are really good at using social media.
[01:36:30.040 --> 01:36:32.680]   And that's the thing is like, that's not a surprise to anybody.
[01:36:32.680 --> 01:36:34.560]   Nobody's shocked by that.
[01:36:34.560 --> 01:36:36.880]   And that's why it'll be easy for them to find somebody good.
[01:36:36.880 --> 01:36:38.400]   All they do say that's what we're going to do.
[01:36:38.400 --> 01:36:42.320]   When you are about to go with a big IPO that's going to make a lot of people a lot of money,
[01:36:42.320 --> 01:36:44.000]   it's easy to get somebody on your board.
[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:45.000]   That's not hard.
[01:36:45.000 --> 01:36:46.400]   I don't think they need to do anything.
[01:36:46.400 --> 01:36:47.880]   You don't think they should respond at all?
[01:36:47.880 --> 01:36:49.960]   Well, they should have shut up on this first thing.
[01:36:49.960 --> 01:36:50.960]   They could have gotten good.
[01:36:50.960 --> 01:36:51.960]   All the women chiming in.
[01:36:51.960 --> 01:36:54.440]   I mean, and Neil Dash is like a not a woman.
[01:36:54.440 --> 01:36:55.440]   He's a guy.
[01:36:55.440 --> 01:36:56.440]   What?
[01:36:56.440 --> 01:36:59.080]   No, that's why I didn't, after that first tweet, and this is the first thing I've said
[01:36:59.080 --> 01:37:01.080]   about it because I'm like, this isn't my place.
[01:37:01.080 --> 01:37:02.080]   Right.
[01:37:02.080 --> 01:37:03.080]   And I don't need to be voice amplified on that.
[01:37:03.080 --> 01:37:06.520]   I said that I sent you, Vivek and email too saying like, you know, I'm glad you feel
[01:37:06.520 --> 01:37:07.520]   strong about this.
[01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:11.040]   But like, I don't think there's any reason we need to be the advocates on this one when
[01:37:11.040 --> 01:37:15.520]   I look at some, like Rachel Schlar or I look at like there's dozens of women that responded
[01:37:15.520 --> 01:37:17.440]   to this and none of them got quoted in the time.
[01:37:17.440 --> 01:37:18.960]   I'm like, that's part of the problem.
[01:37:18.960 --> 01:37:23.080]   Why are all the book authors of the four books we started the show with are all men?
[01:37:23.080 --> 01:37:24.080]   Right.
[01:37:24.080 --> 01:37:25.080]   Because you can't get work.
[01:37:25.080 --> 01:37:26.080]   There we go.
[01:37:26.080 --> 01:37:30.520]   So they write books.
[01:37:30.520 --> 01:37:34.680]   Let's do one quick and then we're going to wrap this thing up with a story about Sony
[01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:35.680]   and Netflix.
[01:37:35.680 --> 01:37:38.600]   But our show today brought to you by a great thing.
[01:37:38.600 --> 01:37:43.520]   If you like listening and obviously you do audible.com, the greatest place in the world,
[01:37:43.520 --> 01:37:46.600]   150,000 audio books coming out.
[01:37:46.600 --> 01:37:47.600]   You're going to do an audible?
[01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:48.600]   Are you reading it?
[01:37:48.600 --> 01:37:50.320]   This book, somebody read this book.
[01:37:50.320 --> 01:37:51.560]   David, I forget his name.
[01:37:51.560 --> 01:37:52.560]   I'm sorry.
[01:37:52.560 --> 01:37:53.560]   Why don't you ask me?
[01:37:53.560 --> 01:37:54.880]   Yeah, Leo would have done it.
[01:37:54.880 --> 01:37:58.080]   Chapter three, the customer in context.
[01:37:58.080 --> 01:37:59.080]   Beautiful.
[01:37:59.080 --> 01:38:06.040]   Sometimes you want to go where everybody knows your name.
[01:38:06.040 --> 01:38:10.000]   Choose theme song, footnote.
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:12.000]   And I could go on like that.
[01:38:12.000 --> 01:38:13.800]   That's what we nail in it.
[01:38:13.800 --> 01:38:15.360]   When you want that?
[01:38:15.360 --> 01:38:17.600]   Do you have two days in the studio?
[01:38:17.600 --> 01:38:19.160]   I know.
[01:38:19.160 --> 01:38:20.160]   But they do.
[01:38:20.160 --> 01:38:21.160]   I'll let you do it.
[01:38:21.160 --> 01:38:22.160]   When are they going to have it?
[01:38:22.160 --> 01:38:23.160]   When are they going to get it?
[01:38:23.160 --> 01:38:24.840]   It should be out any day.
[01:38:24.840 --> 01:38:25.840]   Any day now.
[01:38:25.840 --> 01:38:27.800]   Well, you might want to save your free book.
[01:38:27.800 --> 01:38:28.840]   Actually, you get two free books.
[01:38:28.840 --> 01:38:29.840]   So this is good.
[01:38:29.840 --> 01:38:32.600]   Are you going to go see Ender's Game comes out in a couple of days?
[01:38:32.600 --> 01:38:37.960]   If you have not read the book, please, I beg of you, listen to the book on audible.com
[01:38:37.960 --> 01:38:40.840]   before you have it spoiled by the movie.
[01:38:40.840 --> 01:38:43.940]   Ender's Game is one of the great science fiction stories of all time with one of the most amazing
[01:38:43.940 --> 01:38:45.240]   twists of all time.
[01:38:45.240 --> 01:38:50.520]   But if you have it in the movie, it will spoil the twist and you won't get the real experience
[01:38:50.520 --> 01:38:52.440]   listening to this great book.
[01:38:52.440 --> 01:38:53.440]   There is a 20th anniversary.
[01:38:53.440 --> 01:38:54.440]   What's the twist?
[01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:55.960]   I can't tell you that.
[01:38:55.960 --> 01:38:56.960]   Why?
[01:38:56.960 --> 01:38:59.720]   Because it would be as bad as it would be if the movie spoils it, it would be far worse
[01:38:59.720 --> 01:39:01.640]   of a podcast spoiled it.
[01:39:01.640 --> 01:39:02.640]   Oh, please.
[01:39:02.640 --> 01:39:03.840]   I'll tell you the twist later.
[01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:04.840]   Okay.
[01:39:04.840 --> 01:39:05.840]   Darth Vader is his father.
[01:39:05.840 --> 01:39:06.840]   Yeah.
[01:39:06.840 --> 01:39:07.840]   So that's that.
[01:39:07.840 --> 01:39:11.720]   So this is a great choice.
[01:39:11.720 --> 01:39:16.680]   You get two books, if you go to audible.com/twit2, you're going to sign up for the platinum
[01:39:16.680 --> 01:39:17.840]   accounts, two books a month.
[01:39:17.840 --> 01:39:20.560]   That's the subscription I have.
[01:39:20.560 --> 01:39:24.600]   I just saw World War Z, great book to listen to.
[01:39:24.600 --> 01:39:25.880]   No Brad Pitt, but you know what?
[01:39:25.880 --> 01:39:30.600]   If you imagine it, it's better than any movie could possibly see.
[01:39:30.600 --> 01:39:33.200]   There is a movie tie in addition.
[01:39:33.200 --> 01:39:38.680]   Oh, this has got John Tutturo, Rob Reiner, Mark Hamill, Alfred, Minlina.
[01:39:38.680 --> 01:39:39.680]   Wow.
[01:39:39.680 --> 01:39:41.440]   I like a production version of this.
[01:39:41.440 --> 01:39:43.040]   Oh, I might have to get this now.
[01:39:43.040 --> 01:39:50.040]   New version of this classic zombie novel is it's dramatized, star-studded cast of narrators.
[01:39:50.040 --> 01:39:51.280]   That sounds fun.
[01:39:51.280 --> 01:39:52.280]   Like old radio plays.
[01:39:52.280 --> 01:39:53.280]   It is.
[01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:54.280]   You know what?
[01:39:54.280 --> 01:39:55.280]   They do a lot of this.
[01:39:55.280 --> 01:39:57.000]   There's a Lord of the Rings dramatized.
[01:39:57.000 --> 01:39:59.000]   There's Hitchhiker's Guide.
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:03.480]   They have lecture series, the great courses.
[01:40:03.480 --> 01:40:09.040]   When I was traveling, I went to Troy and I thought, well, I should listen to the Iliad.
[01:40:09.040 --> 01:40:13.840]   And then I got a college course on Homer's Odyssey and Iliad as I'm walking through Troy,
[01:40:13.840 --> 01:40:15.400]   which is good because Troy really, you know what?
[01:40:15.400 --> 01:40:16.560]   It's just a bunch of rocks.
[01:40:16.560 --> 01:40:17.560]   Yeah.
[01:40:17.560 --> 01:40:18.760]   It really isn't a lot going on.
[01:40:18.760 --> 01:40:20.200]   They do have a horse.
[01:40:20.200 --> 01:40:22.120]   They close the clubs.
[01:40:22.120 --> 01:40:28.600]   The wooden horse from the movie they have there, but that's about it.
[01:40:28.600 --> 01:40:29.600]   That's true.
[01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:31.280]   They have a wooden horse from the movie.
[01:40:31.280 --> 01:40:32.280]   They do.
[01:40:32.280 --> 01:40:33.920]   Is that what they use for storage?
[01:40:33.920 --> 01:40:38.360]   The problem is it's just a bunch of rocks and they don't even know if it was Troy or
[01:40:38.360 --> 01:40:39.360]   what.
[01:40:39.360 --> 01:40:42.640]   So if you have the wooden horse, it gives people some context.
[01:40:42.640 --> 01:40:46.120]   I thought it was better to listen to the lecture myself.
[01:40:46.120 --> 01:40:49.240]   You're going to go see the Captain Phillips movie.
[01:40:49.240 --> 01:40:52.560]   He's got his own book, you know, Richard Phillips, A Captain's Duty, Somali Pirates,
[01:40:52.560 --> 01:40:57.520]   Navy Seals and Dangerous Days at Sea, the John Seed of Wirak story.

[01:41:14.040 --> 01:41:15.280]   They've got self-help books.

[01:41:25.720 --> 01:41:31.640]   So Sony is the first major movie company to do with Netflix.
[01:41:31.640 --> 01:41:36.160]   Now Netflix did a deal to do a house of cards with Trigger Street, the production of Netflix.
[01:41:36.160 --> 01:41:37.160]   It's a production company.
[01:41:37.160 --> 01:41:38.160]   Awesome show.
[01:41:38.160 --> 01:41:39.160]   I can't wait.
[01:41:39.160 --> 01:41:40.160]   Season two is coming soon.
[01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:44.680]   Orange is the New Black by Genji Cohen, the creator of Weeds.
[01:41:44.680 --> 01:41:47.280]   They brought Arrested Development back.
[01:41:47.280 --> 01:41:51.200]   Sony is, Sony Studios did Breaking Bad.
[01:41:51.200 --> 01:41:58.000]   They did the Blacklist and the creators of Damages, they're going to do a TV series,
[01:41:58.000 --> 01:42:00.320]   a TV show for Netflix.
[01:42:00.320 --> 01:42:02.240]   This is, I think, good news.
[01:42:02.240 --> 01:42:04.440]   I think Netflix has done a great job.
[01:42:04.440 --> 01:42:07.720]   I'm thrilled to see a real studio doing this deal.
[01:42:07.720 --> 01:42:14.920]   In the deal, Netflix gets the right to premiere the one hour drama everywhere.
[01:42:14.920 --> 01:42:19.640]   Surprising maybe that Sony is doing this, but I think a sign, there's a new model of
[01:42:19.640 --> 01:42:21.840]   foot for television production.
[01:42:21.840 --> 01:42:24.040]   Good news.
[01:42:24.040 --> 01:42:25.440]   You can email cash to anybody.
[01:42:25.440 --> 01:42:31.640]   This makes me nervous and I want somebody to reassure me Square is going to let me email
[01:42:31.640 --> 01:42:37.240]   cash to people if you have a debit card.
[01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:38.240]   Has anybody used this?
[01:42:38.240 --> 01:42:40.040]   No, it's not worth playing with though.
[01:42:40.040 --> 01:42:43.400]   Yeah, my friend tried it out and I saw those sides of it.
[01:42:43.400 --> 01:42:44.400]   How can these be secure?
[01:42:44.400 --> 01:42:47.760]   You're very welcome to send me cash by the way, anytime.
[01:42:47.760 --> 01:42:50.800]   It goes into your, it goes into your, go to our@gmail.com.
[01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:51.800]   All right, wait a minute.
[01:42:51.800 --> 01:42:52.800]   Just try this then.
[01:42:52.800 --> 01:42:53.800]   I'll see what you got with you.
[01:42:53.800 --> 01:42:55.800]   Try it because it's a no agenda show.
[01:42:55.800 --> 01:42:57.560]   We've only wanted to be a night.
[01:42:57.560 --> 01:42:58.920]   Now's your opportunity.
[01:42:58.920 --> 01:43:03.000]   I liked Walt Goss put a review of it where he just casually mentions that he emailed somebody
[01:43:03.000 --> 01:43:04.200]   a thousand dollars.
[01:43:04.200 --> 01:43:09.280]   Yeah, when I test out an app, I don't eat a thousand dollars.
[01:43:09.280 --> 01:43:11.160]   I know he's a little crap.
[01:43:11.160 --> 01:43:12.680]   Well, he had him send it back too.
[01:43:12.680 --> 01:43:13.680]   That was the other thing.
[01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:14.680]   Make sure he gave it.
[01:43:14.680 --> 01:43:18.440]   Well, he could have sent him 35 bucks and not take it, you know.
[01:43:18.440 --> 01:43:22.520]   Yeah, it's fun selling these books because people are like, I don't have 20 bucks.
[01:43:22.520 --> 01:43:23.920]   It's like, do you have a square?
[01:43:23.920 --> 01:43:24.920]   Do you have the correct?
[01:43:24.920 --> 01:43:27.320]   Oh, so you have it and you swipe it.
[01:43:27.320 --> 01:43:28.320]   Yeah.
[01:43:28.320 --> 01:43:29.320]   And I trust that.
[01:43:29.320 --> 01:43:30.320]   It's reliable.
[01:43:30.320 --> 01:43:34.320]   You know, this is sort of like PayPal, but there's a lower fee and it's easier.
[01:43:34.320 --> 01:43:35.320]   There's no fee.
[01:43:35.320 --> 01:43:36.320]   There's no fee.
[01:43:36.320 --> 01:43:38.720]   Well, there's a donation.
[01:43:38.720 --> 01:43:42.120]   If you say you're buying a service from somebody, there's a donation.
[01:43:42.120 --> 01:43:43.120]   Like you can decide.
[01:43:43.120 --> 01:43:44.920]   How should I send you, John?
[01:43:44.920 --> 01:43:45.920]   A thousand.
[01:43:45.920 --> 01:43:46.920]   Yeah, we'll take a.
[01:43:46.920 --> 01:43:47.920]   We send it back.
[01:43:47.920 --> 01:43:48.920]   We send it back.
[01:43:48.920 --> 01:43:51.320]   If you don't put a subject line in it defaults to a thousand dollars.
[01:43:51.320 --> 01:43:55.240]   So what will happen if you do that, Leo, the first time you'll get an email that invites
[01:43:55.240 --> 01:43:59.040]   you to put your debit card number into squares servers.
[01:43:59.040 --> 01:44:02.440]   And then when John in order to receive it, he also has to do the same thing.
[01:44:02.440 --> 01:44:05.640]   So it's a transfer and you'll get the money in one to two days.
[01:44:05.640 --> 01:44:06.640]   Where's divorce at?
[01:44:06.640 --> 01:44:08.400]   No agenda at dewar.org.
[01:44:08.400 --> 01:44:09.400]   No agenda.
[01:44:09.400 --> 01:44:11.240]   That would make sure it goes into the right.
[01:44:11.240 --> 01:44:14.040]   Somebody asked how many bitcoins did I lose on Silk Road?
[01:44:14.040 --> 01:44:15.640]   Oh, did you lose anything?
[01:44:15.640 --> 01:44:18.040]   No, I don't have any bitcoins.
[01:44:18.040 --> 01:44:19.040]   No.
[01:44:19.040 --> 01:44:20.640]   You're the only one.
[01:44:20.640 --> 01:44:21.640]   HE.
[01:44:21.640 --> 01:44:24.840]   That's the only thing he doesn't have that I will admit to.
[01:44:24.840 --> 01:44:27.640]   The Vorac.org.
[01:44:27.640 --> 01:44:28.640]   Yeah.
[01:44:28.640 --> 01:44:29.640]   OK.
[01:44:29.640 --> 01:44:30.640]   No agenda at dewar.org.
[01:44:30.640 --> 01:44:31.640]   OK, $1,000.
[01:44:31.640 --> 01:44:33.440]   That would be good.
[01:44:33.440 --> 01:44:34.440]   From Leo.
[01:44:34.440 --> 01:44:39.040]   If you live in heaven, you don't need to use loading checking your email for your email.
[01:44:39.040 --> 01:44:40.040]   Yeah.
[01:44:40.040 --> 01:44:41.040]   Yeah.
[01:44:41.040 --> 01:44:42.040]   Loading.
[01:44:42.040 --> 01:44:43.040]   Email sent.
[01:44:43.040 --> 01:44:44.040]   Oh, great.
[01:44:44.040 --> 01:44:45.040]   Wow.
[01:44:45.040 --> 01:44:46.040]   You're rich.
[01:44:46.040 --> 01:44:47.040]   So that was pretty easy.
[01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:48.440]   I just worry about security like.
[01:44:48.440 --> 01:44:49.440]   Yeah.
[01:44:49.440 --> 01:44:50.440]   Well, I guess it's too easy.
[01:44:50.440 --> 01:44:53.640]   Why is it different than PayPal or something?
[01:44:53.640 --> 01:44:59.160]   PayPal and Google Wallet, both once you're registered with them, let you do email transmissions
[01:44:59.160 --> 01:45:00.160]   like this.
[01:45:00.160 --> 01:45:01.160]   Yeah.
[01:45:01.160 --> 01:45:04.200]   But this doesn't require any signup other than putting your debit card into squares
[01:45:04.200 --> 01:45:05.200]   servers.
[01:45:05.200 --> 01:45:06.200]   Yeah.
[01:45:06.200 --> 01:45:07.760]   All they did is they flipped the signup to later in the process.
[01:45:07.760 --> 01:45:08.760]   Oh, right.
[01:45:08.760 --> 01:45:09.760]   Which is great.
[01:45:09.760 --> 01:45:10.760]   It's a great user experience.
[01:45:10.760 --> 01:45:14.480]   But I mean, I could email cash through my Chase account or through my PayPal account
[01:45:14.480 --> 01:45:15.480]   for years.
[01:45:15.480 --> 01:45:16.480]   OK.
[01:45:16.480 --> 01:45:17.480]   So this, OK.
[01:45:17.480 --> 01:45:18.480]   It's just marketing to really have it.
[01:45:18.480 --> 01:45:19.480]   They will.
[01:45:19.480 --> 01:45:20.480]   They've already got it.
[01:45:20.480 --> 01:45:21.480]   Wait a minute.
[01:45:21.480 --> 01:45:22.480]   Publish is clearing house.
[01:45:22.480 --> 01:45:23.480]   I've won $7 million.
[01:45:23.480 --> 01:45:26.920]   Good luck you achieve when you give money to the No Agenda show.
[01:45:26.920 --> 01:45:27.920]   Very common.
[01:45:27.920 --> 01:45:28.920]   Amazing.
[01:45:28.920 --> 01:45:29.920]   Yes.
[01:45:29.920 --> 01:45:30.920]   You think you turned $1,007 million?
[01:45:30.920 --> 01:45:31.920]   Oh, it's only $7,000.
[01:45:31.920 --> 01:45:33.920]   Spam, it's going to ask you to share.
[01:45:33.920 --> 01:45:34.920]   So it's going to ask you to share.
[01:45:34.920 --> 01:45:38.520]   Every week for life, I plan to live a good, long time.
[01:45:38.520 --> 01:45:40.960]   How long would I have to live to make it $7 million?
[01:45:40.960 --> 01:45:43.280]   A long, freaking time.
[01:45:43.280 --> 01:45:46.520]   That's what the spammers should do is just say, I'm a Nigerian prince.
[01:45:46.520 --> 01:45:48.120]   Will you please square email me?
[01:45:48.120 --> 01:45:50.120]   A thousand weeks is all.
[01:45:50.120 --> 01:45:51.120]   A thousand weeks.
[01:45:51.120 --> 01:45:53.120]   That's not so bad.
[01:45:53.120 --> 01:45:54.560]   I could live a thousand weeks.
[01:45:54.560 --> 01:45:56.400]   Well, it's 52 weeks in a year.
[01:45:56.400 --> 01:45:57.400]   So you figured that out.
[01:45:57.400 --> 01:45:58.400]   20 years.
[01:45:58.400 --> 01:45:59.400]   Yeah.
[01:45:59.400 --> 01:46:00.400]   Yeah.
[01:46:00.400 --> 01:46:01.400]   I could do that.
[01:46:01.400 --> 01:46:02.400]   Yeah, no brainer.
[01:46:02.400 --> 01:46:03.400]   No brainer.
[01:46:03.400 --> 01:46:04.400]   It gives me a reason to live.
[01:46:04.400 --> 01:46:05.720]   So you can get that check in the mail.
[01:46:05.720 --> 01:46:09.080]   I want that check from Ed McMahon every week.
[01:46:09.080 --> 01:46:10.080]   All right.
[01:46:10.080 --> 01:46:11.080]   Well, that was easy.
[01:46:11.080 --> 01:46:12.080]   And I did that all from scratch.
[01:46:12.080 --> 01:46:13.320]   I hadn't installed it or anything.
[01:46:13.320 --> 01:46:16.440]   So now I'm going to get an email that I have to fill out and give them some financial
[01:46:16.440 --> 01:46:17.440]   information.
[01:46:17.440 --> 01:46:18.440]   And that will never happen.
[01:46:18.440 --> 01:46:19.440]   That's not going to happen.
[01:46:19.440 --> 01:46:20.440]   That's where I have to do it.
[01:46:20.440 --> 01:46:21.440]   No.
[01:46:21.440 --> 01:46:29.000]   Other stories we want to mention here before we wrap this puppy up, put a bow on it.
[01:46:29.000 --> 01:46:30.000]   Anybody?
[01:46:30.000 --> 01:46:31.000]   I want it.
[01:46:31.000 --> 01:46:32.000]   Go ahead.
[01:46:32.000 --> 01:46:33.000]   The VORAC was right.
[01:46:33.000 --> 01:46:38.480]   10 to 5, I guess, your time.
[01:46:38.480 --> 01:46:41.760]   The words I don't want to hear in my life, the VORAC was right.
[01:46:41.760 --> 01:46:44.400]   Yeah, I knew I was right when you first made the idea.
[01:46:44.400 --> 01:46:45.400]   Okay.
[01:46:45.400 --> 01:46:46.400]   I'll know, but that's Leo time.
[01:46:46.400 --> 01:46:47.400]   I'm 10, 15 minutes off.
[01:46:47.400 --> 01:46:48.400]   It's pretty close.
[01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:51.080]   We started on time, though.
[01:46:51.080 --> 01:46:53.160]   So I want to plug a new domain while we're here.
[01:46:53.160 --> 01:46:54.160]   Okay.
[01:46:54.160 --> 01:46:55.160]   What is it?
[01:46:55.160 --> 01:46:56.160]   A new domain.
[01:46:56.160 --> 01:46:59.320]   It's a new domain, but what is the new domain?
[01:46:59.320 --> 01:47:00.320]   What are you going to do?
[01:47:00.320 --> 01:47:02.080]   You're going to do an Abden Castello with me.
[01:47:02.080 --> 01:47:03.080]   Who's on first?
[01:47:03.080 --> 01:47:05.600]   Oh, no, I understand this new domain.
[01:47:05.600 --> 01:47:06.600]   But what is it?
[01:47:06.600 --> 01:47:07.600]   Yeah, it's a new domain.
[01:47:07.600 --> 01:47:08.600]   Yeah.
[01:47:08.600 --> 01:47:09.600]   Yeah.
[01:47:09.600 --> 01:47:10.600]   Okay.
[01:47:10.600 --> 01:47:11.600]   So what is it?
[01:47:11.600 --> 01:47:13.400]   Hey, I've gotten to these arguments myself with yourself.
[01:47:13.400 --> 01:47:14.400]   No, no, no.
[01:47:14.400 --> 01:47:15.400]   Okay.
[01:47:15.400 --> 01:47:17.160]   I'm ready to type it in.
[01:47:17.160 --> 01:47:18.160]   What is the new domain?
[01:47:18.160 --> 01:47:19.840]   You're there, a new domain.net.
[01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:20.840]   Oh.
[01:47:20.840 --> 01:47:21.840]   It worked.
[01:47:21.840 --> 01:47:23.440]   And John, you don't write about tech on this.
[01:47:23.440 --> 01:47:24.440]   Yes, I do.
[01:47:24.440 --> 01:47:25.440]   I wrote about this.
[01:47:25.440 --> 01:47:28.280]   I have every photo of Steve Ballmer with his tongue sticking out.
[01:47:28.280 --> 01:47:29.760]   That's one good article.
[01:47:29.760 --> 01:47:30.760]   Very funny, by the way.
[01:47:30.760 --> 01:47:31.920]   Also Chicago hot dogs.
[01:47:31.920 --> 01:47:33.760]   So, well, yeah, I did that.
[01:47:33.760 --> 01:47:36.160]   On popular science, idiocy, and trolls.
[01:47:36.160 --> 01:47:38.880]   This is from your show.
[01:47:38.880 --> 01:47:40.880]   You had all these guys on going on.
[01:47:40.880 --> 01:47:42.680]   I'm nervous to read this.
[01:47:42.680 --> 01:47:47.120]   This is when you said, oh, it's so great that popular sciences just stopped their
[01:47:47.120 --> 01:47:51.000]   comments because the public is crazy and they hate science.
[01:47:51.000 --> 01:47:52.000]   I didn't say that.
[01:47:52.000 --> 01:47:53.000]   Yeah, you did.
[01:47:53.000 --> 01:47:54.000]   You and you had Molly.
[01:47:54.000 --> 01:47:57.320]   Molly, you just pushed all the commenters back to Facebook show.
[01:47:57.320 --> 01:47:58.320]   Was I on the show chat?
[01:47:58.320 --> 01:47:59.320]   I don't think that was Tom Merrick.
[01:47:59.320 --> 01:48:00.320]   Oh, maybe you're right.
[01:48:00.320 --> 01:48:01.320]   It was Mary.
[01:48:01.320 --> 01:48:02.320]   It was Tom Merrick.
[01:48:02.320 --> 01:48:03.320]   Right.
[01:48:03.320 --> 01:48:04.320]   Well, you weren't mentioned in this article then.
[01:48:04.320 --> 01:48:05.320]   Okay.
[01:48:05.320 --> 01:48:06.320]   Thank you.
[01:48:06.320 --> 01:48:07.840]   And you talked about Chicago hot dogs, football.
[01:48:07.840 --> 01:48:09.240]   Somebody had to talk about Chicago hot dogs.
[01:48:09.240 --> 01:48:10.920]   I'm trying to find the Balmer story though.
[01:48:10.920 --> 01:48:11.920]   I'm dying to read this.
[01:48:11.920 --> 01:48:14.720]   It was on the scroll here.
[01:48:14.720 --> 01:48:17.960]   You know, it was a funny picture.
[01:48:17.960 --> 01:48:20.240]   Balmer with his tongue sticking out.
[01:48:20.240 --> 01:48:22.680]   No, not there.
[01:48:22.680 --> 01:48:23.680]   I guess they bounced it.
[01:48:23.680 --> 01:48:25.960]   Probably got a note from Balmer.
[01:48:25.960 --> 01:48:28.120]   So you used to do this with Bill Gates.
[01:48:28.120 --> 01:48:32.080]   You would take all of the moments in Bill Gates' keynote where he gulped.
[01:48:32.080 --> 01:48:33.080]   Yeah.
[01:48:33.080 --> 01:48:34.080]   That was a great bit.
[01:48:34.080 --> 01:48:36.280]   And you actually used a video toaster and you edited it all together.
[01:48:36.280 --> 01:48:38.440]   So it was one long gold sequence.
[01:48:38.440 --> 01:48:39.440]   Yeah.
[01:48:39.440 --> 01:48:41.240]   It went on for a long time.
[01:48:41.240 --> 01:48:44.200]   We have to do that with Paul Graham.
[01:48:44.200 --> 01:48:49.080]   He always says, mmm, mmm.
[01:48:49.080 --> 01:48:54.680]   Mr. Scobles newest is called Age of Context, Mobile Sensors Data in the Future Privacy.
[01:48:54.680 --> 01:48:57.080]   That's why I'm hiding behind the book.
[01:48:57.080 --> 01:49:01.520]   Vic Gondatra, I don't know who he is, says, "We are past information at your fingertips
[01:49:01.520 --> 01:49:03.160]   in the coming Age of Context.
[01:49:03.160 --> 01:49:05.320]   You won't even use your fingers."
[01:49:05.320 --> 01:49:06.320]   Wow.
[01:49:06.320 --> 01:49:07.320]   Whoa.
[01:49:07.320 --> 01:49:08.320]   Whoa.
[01:49:08.320 --> 01:49:10.320]   Look at your Moto X.
[01:49:10.320 --> 01:49:13.080]   You, you, I don't, I talked to it.
[01:49:13.080 --> 01:49:14.080]   Yeah.
[01:49:14.080 --> 01:49:15.080]   I'm a sticker to it.
[01:49:15.080 --> 01:49:16.080]   I'm not.
[01:49:16.080 --> 01:49:17.080]   My fingers anymore.
[01:49:17.080 --> 01:49:18.080]   You know, this is exciting.
[01:49:18.080 --> 01:49:19.080]   This is available on Amazon.
[01:49:19.080 --> 01:49:20.080]   Amazon.
[01:49:20.080 --> 01:49:21.080]   Print on demand.
[01:49:21.080 --> 01:49:23.440]   And Audible coming shortly.
[01:49:23.440 --> 01:49:24.880]   So Audible.com.
[01:49:24.880 --> 01:49:29.920]   But it's blogs at dashes, d-a-s-h-e-s.com.
[01:49:29.920 --> 01:49:31.880]   He also, say again.
[01:49:31.880 --> 01:49:36.080]   And fans of this network who love Gina Trapani, I've been working with her for a long time.
[01:49:36.080 --> 01:49:39.960]   I'll think up and we have been having an incredible response to the campaign to launch
[01:49:39.960 --> 01:49:40.960]   it.
[01:49:40.960 --> 01:49:47.240]   Very much, especially to your viewers and audience have been fundamental.
[01:49:47.240 --> 01:49:48.240]   Partition.
[01:49:48.240 --> 01:49:49.520]   Think up.com.
[01:49:49.520 --> 01:49:50.840]   You would like it.
[01:49:50.840 --> 01:49:55.880]   For 60 bucks a year, you get analytics on all of your social networks, right?
[01:49:55.880 --> 01:49:56.880]   I'm going to get Facebook.
[01:49:56.880 --> 01:49:57.880]   I'm going to get Twitter.
[01:49:57.880 --> 01:50:02.880]   I'm going to get Google+, what else?
[01:50:02.880 --> 01:50:03.880]   Instagram.
[01:50:03.880 --> 01:50:04.880]   Instagram.
[01:50:04.880 --> 01:50:05.880]   Yeah, Instagram we're working on right now.
[01:50:05.880 --> 01:50:06.880]   And that's really exciting.
[01:50:06.880 --> 01:50:07.880]   Very cool.
[01:50:07.880 --> 01:50:11.440]   Do you have a sample of the kind of analytics that you can get so you can see what it's
[01:50:11.440 --> 01:50:12.440]   like before you sign up?
[01:50:12.440 --> 01:50:15.520]   Yeah, we're actually going to start sharing this week.
[01:50:15.520 --> 01:50:18.800]   And the stuff, you know, one of them was how much you talk about yourself.
[01:50:18.800 --> 01:50:22.160]   And for Gina, it was like eight times in a week that she talked about herself.
[01:50:22.160 --> 01:50:23.920]   She thought, oh, I should dial it down.
[01:50:23.920 --> 01:50:25.720]   And mine was like 150.
[01:50:25.720 --> 01:50:30.240]   And I thought, oh, maybe I should ease back a little bit too.
[01:50:30.240 --> 01:50:33.880]   But there's even just simple stuff like, you know, do people like your new profile picture
[01:50:33.880 --> 01:50:34.880]   more than your old one?
[01:50:34.880 --> 01:50:36.400]   And that kind of stuff is fun.
[01:50:36.400 --> 01:50:37.720]   Think up is open source.
[01:50:37.720 --> 01:50:41.120]   You can host it yourself, but this will be a hosted solution for people who don't want
[01:50:41.120 --> 01:50:43.760]   to do all the installation involved.
[01:50:43.760 --> 01:50:44.760]   Good goings.
[01:50:44.760 --> 01:50:45.760]   Nice to talk to you again, Neil.
[01:50:45.760 --> 01:50:46.760]   Thanks for coming.
[01:50:46.760 --> 01:50:47.760]   Good to see you too.
[01:50:47.760 --> 01:50:54.040]   Dwight Silverman is available at, I'm just waiting for you to hit me with a laser burst
[01:50:54.040 --> 01:50:55.040]   of some kind.
[01:50:55.040 --> 01:50:57.040]   That's like a duck punk.
[01:50:57.040 --> 01:50:58.040]   Oh, that's it.
[01:50:58.040 --> 01:50:59.040]   He just needs a helmet.
[01:50:59.040 --> 01:51:00.040]   Yeah.
[01:51:00.040 --> 01:51:01.040]   There we go.
[01:51:01.040 --> 01:51:05.800]   Dwight Silverman blogs at the Houston Chronicle blog.tech.com/techblog.com/techblog.
[01:51:05.800 --> 01:51:11.960]   But he can also be heard every Wednesday on the Pacifica radio network in Houston.
[01:51:11.960 --> 01:51:14.280]   And the show is bites up.
[01:51:14.280 --> 01:51:19.040]   No technology technology bites technology and bites.
[01:51:19.040 --> 01:51:24.680]   And you can just do it at kpft.org or if you're in Houston, it's 90.1 FM.
[01:51:24.680 --> 01:51:30.200]   And we're there for two hours every night, although every Wednesday night, although unfortunately
[01:51:30.200 --> 01:51:32.280]   this week is a fundraiser.
[01:51:32.280 --> 01:51:35.280]   So don't listen this week unless you want to give us money.
[01:51:35.280 --> 01:51:38.760]   You know, we're all learning from John, aren't we?
[01:51:38.760 --> 01:51:40.160]   He's really invented that.
[01:51:40.160 --> 01:51:41.160]   Give us money.
[01:51:41.160 --> 01:51:42.160]   Give us money.
[01:51:42.160 --> 01:51:44.400]   We do twit every Sunday afternoon at 3 p.m.
[01:51:44.400 --> 01:51:46.280]   Pacifica 6 p.m. Eastern time.
[01:51:46.280 --> 01:51:52.680]   2200 UTC if you can watch live due because the chatroom gives us all of our best lines.
[01:51:52.680 --> 01:51:55.520]   But if you can't, there it is.
[01:51:55.520 --> 01:51:56.520]   What he does that a lot.
[01:51:56.520 --> 01:51:59.400]   He's got kind of a weird tongue that Steve Balmer's tongue.
[01:51:59.400 --> 01:52:00.400]   It's pointy.
[01:52:00.400 --> 01:52:01.400]   The best one is the most.
[01:52:01.400 --> 01:52:02.400]   It looks like the devil.
[01:52:02.400 --> 01:52:03.400]   And wait a minute.
[01:52:03.400 --> 01:52:05.720]   That's not even a service.
[01:52:05.720 --> 01:52:07.920]   Miley Cyrus have Steve Balmer's tongue.
[01:52:07.920 --> 01:52:08.920]   Give it back.
[01:52:08.920 --> 01:52:09.920]   Wow.
[01:52:09.920 --> 01:52:11.440]   That's the good one.
[01:52:11.440 --> 01:52:12.440]   It's blue.
[01:52:12.440 --> 01:52:13.600]   Why is he doing this?
[01:52:13.600 --> 01:52:17.080]   You know, why is Miley Cyrus doing it?
[01:52:17.080 --> 01:52:19.080]   It's just the new thing.
[01:52:19.080 --> 01:52:20.200]   Yeah, the tongue is out.
[01:52:20.200 --> 01:52:21.200]   It has to come out.
[01:52:21.200 --> 01:52:23.080]   It's got to come out.
[01:52:23.080 --> 01:52:24.080]   Wow.
[01:52:24.080 --> 01:52:26.200]   Please tune in live.
[01:52:26.200 --> 01:52:27.200]   You can see things like that.
[01:52:27.200 --> 01:52:32.080]   But if you can't, you may know, you have a video available after the fact that twit.tv
[01:52:32.080 --> 01:52:35.880]   And of course, wherever you subscribe to podcast, if you'd like to be here live in the studio,
[01:52:35.880 --> 01:52:37.240]   we love having live audience.
[01:52:37.240 --> 01:52:38.240]   Thank you all for being here.
[01:52:38.240 --> 01:52:39.440]   Just email tickets@twit.tv.
[01:52:39.440 --> 01:52:41.000]   We'll put a chair out for you.
[01:52:41.000 --> 01:52:42.240]   Have a nice little snack.
[01:52:42.240 --> 01:52:43.240]   We just come by.
[01:52:43.240 --> 01:52:45.120]   Keys to the car underneath your chair.
[01:52:45.120 --> 01:52:46.920]   Don't all look now.
[01:52:46.920 --> 01:52:47.920]   Thank you for joining us.
[01:52:47.920 --> 01:52:48.920]   We'll see you later.
[01:52:48.920 --> 01:52:49.920]   Another twin.
[01:52:49.920 --> 01:52:50.920]   He is in the can.
[01:52:50.920 --> 01:52:51.920]   Yeah.
[01:52:51.920 --> 01:52:52.920]   Do it.
[01:52:52.920 --> 01:52:53.920]   Do it.
[01:52:53.920 --> 01:52:54.920]   The twin.
[01:52:54.920 --> 01:52:55.920]   All right.
[01:52:55.920 --> 01:52:56.920]   Do it.
[01:52:56.920 --> 01:52:57.920]   The twin.
[01:52:57.920 --> 01:52:58.920]   Baby.
[01:52:58.920 --> 01:52:59.920]   Do it.
[01:52:59.920 --> 01:53:00.920]   The twin.
[01:53:00.920 --> 01:53:01.920]   All right.
[01:53:01.920 --> 01:53:02.920]   That's it.
[01:53:02.920 --> 01:53:03.920]   The third time is he when it comes out.
[01:53:03.920 --> 01:53:04.920]   He's time for twit.
[01:53:04.920 --> 01:53:11.920]   And if I get together because we got the Vorek, we got Scobo, he's going to be an amazing
[01:53:11.920 --> 01:53:12.920]   show.
[01:53:12.920 --> 01:53:14.560]   Even Oprah's here.
[01:53:14.560 --> 01:53:15.560]   You stay tuned.
[01:53:15.560 --> 01:53:16.720]   Twit is next.
[01:53:16.720 --> 01:53:20.080]   [LAUGHTER]
