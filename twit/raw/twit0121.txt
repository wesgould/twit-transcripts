[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Welcome to the Facebook Social.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   This weekend tech is brought to you by Audible.com.

[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   >> This is Twit, episode 121, and I think a really great panel.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   We have some real smart people today.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.000]   John C. Dvorak cannot be here.
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   He is acting as the minister.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   He is marrying his stepson today.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   And apparently he has one of those paper licenses that allow--
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   I have one too, allows you to marry people.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   He is a member of the Universal Life Church, a pastor.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   So Reverend Dvorak will be out.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   It's possible, a possible, a practical to stop by.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   He said he would.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   He, of course, has a new baby and is a little busy.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   And we'll just leave it-- like Elijah, we leave a place at the table
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   for Patrick.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   You never know what's going to happen.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   But we do have the kid from Brooklyn, Jason Callicannis.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   >> This is the kid from Brooklyn.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   >> The kid from Brooklyn.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   >> He's Mr. Mahalo.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   And by the way, we had Veronica on last week,
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   and I've been loved-- you launched Mahalo Daily,
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   and I love it.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   She's great.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   >> I wish I could take, you know, like 1% of the credit,
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   but we have an incredible producer named Tyler,
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   and we have an incredibly talented host,
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   so I am drafting on their success.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   >> No, you're well.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   Yeah, you had the good sense to bring him in.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   >> I pay for the meals.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Crash services is my title.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   >> That's okay.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   You know, that's a useful thing to have.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   It's always good to have somebody to pay for the meals.
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   >> Absolutely.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   >> Also with us, Jerry Pournell, ladies and gentlemen,
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   Mr. Chaos Manor.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Love Jerry.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   His work in Bite Magazine for many years made me a better geek.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   And he still writes from Chaos Manor online at JerryPournell.com,
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   and we love having him on Twitch.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   It's good to see you again, Jerry.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   >> Thank you.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   >> And celebrating with his new iPhone,
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   legally purchased this time from Oxford, England, Will Harris.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   >> Yes, and who?
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   >> Hey, Will.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   So did you go, did you get in line?
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   >> No, you know what?
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   There just weren't any cues, really, at all.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   It was actually kind of unfortunate that I had to get one,
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   because actually the one that I had from the States I broke last week.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   You know how you just drop it, and suddenly the screen smashes.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   >> I was trying to prove that British people are more intelligent than Americans.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   They did not queue for the iPhone.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   >> No, it was just a big letdown.
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   If you read some of the reports, it seems like the Apple Store was basically full of press,
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   and then one guy outside.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   >> Was it just that?
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   >> We're not used to paying for a phone and paying for a contract.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   It's like you pay for the phone, you don't get a contract,
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   or you pay for the contract, you get the phone free.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   The idea of paying for a contract and paying like 300 pounds for a phone
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   is completely alien to 90% of the British population.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   >> Is that how much it was, 300 pounds?
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   >> Yeah, it's 270.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   >> It's expensive.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   >> Yeah, it was 540 in dollars, which obviously is a little more expensive.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   >> A little more interest in Germany, though.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   It says there were some lines.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   >> Yeah, T-Mobile says.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   >> I think it's interesting how the iPhone is taken back.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   See, now that Google, this is the week Google announced Android,
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   it's a telephone operating system.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   I think there's a lot of eyes now.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   We've moved on, haven't we?
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   We're looking at the next big thing.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   >> But don't you think Android, this whole thing,
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   wasn't it just a complete letdown?
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   I mean, for months and months and months,
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   I mean, Google phone, I'm going to have all these awesome Google things.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   An actual fact, A, you're not going to get anything until the second half of 2008.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   And B, you're still reliant on the handset designs from third parties
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   who have consistently shown that they can't design anything,
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   at least in hardware terms, match Apple.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:31.000]   And I think most people are thinking, like, if anybody can outbeat Apple,
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   it's Google, but Google is basically like, you know,
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   passed on the whole thing to the third party.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   It just seems a bit of a letdown.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   >> HTC might just say.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   >> I wondered about that myself.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   Are there any third party designers out there who are making phones
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   that you actually want to use?
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   >> I like HTC's phones.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   They do the tilt for AT&T.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   They do --
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   >> Well, the Helio is a great phone.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   I mean, people -- I was playing poker last night with these, like, young celebrities in Hollywood
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   and a third of them had Helios, and they loved them.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   >> I saw you were on Twitter down 400 bucks.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   Did you come back?
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   >> I got brutalized.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   >> Pocket aces, beat you, too, Pear.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   >> I have pocket aces, and, like, this kid is betting, this kid from, like,
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   one of these TV shows on Fox is betting, like, $100 out of $5 by an --
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   a $5 anti-table with Queen, too.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   It's, like, fold.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   And he's betting $100, and it just -- it all made no sense, so I can't take it.
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   I should know better.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   >> Play with the big boys.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   So, now, who makes the Helio sets?
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   >> Well, Helio is -- I guess they have the investment from the Korean telecom company.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   I think they actually make the handsets, but I think, actually, what Google's going to do
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   is I would look for Google to create a fund.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   You know, they've been investing in companies a little bit, and VCs are getting a little dicey
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   about that, like, "Hey, aren't you supposed to be buying the company's not investing in them?"
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   But I wouldn't be surprised if Google just sets aside $100 million and says, "Hey,
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   we'll invest in people who want to make hardware.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   Why not?"
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   You know?
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   If they don't get the results they're looking for.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   >> Which is a bigger announcement.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Open Social or Android?
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   >> Mm.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Open Social.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   >> You think that's something?
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   >> I do.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   >> Or is Android just nothing?
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   >> No, I think they're both going to be very important.
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   You know, like all these open platform things, you know, you have to wait and see.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   I mean, Jabber was supposed to change the world, and if people don't participate, it doesn't, right?
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   >> Right, right, right.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   >> So, it's not like your aim is talking to, you know, your Yahoo Messenger or whatever
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   unless somebody hacks it.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   So, it really depends on buy-in from people, but I have to say, you know, I have this, like,
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Facebook group for Mahalo Daily.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   It's got a bunch of people in it.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   And it's nice, but then I started playing with Nang over the last week because I've been
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   trading emails with Andreessen on some things.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   And it is brilliant.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   >> Yeah, I love Nang.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   >> I mean, you have absolute total control.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   I think it, I understand why people put in whatever $50 million into the last round.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   It's going to be huge, and people are going to want to own and control their social network.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   I'm talking about companies and individuals.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   And it's going to have a huge impact, I think, on Facebook's business because once you get
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   the point at which your Facebook group or your business's presence there or your presence
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   there, it becomes truly important to you.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   You want control of it back.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   You want to put your advertising on it.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   You want to put your collateral on it.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   You're going to want your statistics.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   Like, I have no statistics.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   I can't see how many times video is reviewed on Facebook.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   And they're not going to give control of that stuff.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   So, I think you'll start seeing, like, the top people jump over to services like Nang very quickly.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   >> Nang is a partner in open, or a signatory, whatever you would call it to open.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   >> I think Andreessen's driving the boat.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   >> Really?
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   >> Well, you remember he came out with that post about two months ago where he was like,
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   "Oh, Facebook's open platform.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   It's fantastic."
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   But it's a level two, and there's a higher level, level three, and here's what that would
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   be.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   And he sort of just primed the market like a level.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   He basically described it.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   So, he basically, I think that was the setup.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   Obviously, they've been working on this for months.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   I wouldn't be surprised if it's his idea, and he drove the ship on it.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   Got everybody's buy-in.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   >> Well, it was at Google for a while, but Brad Fitzpatrick of LiveJournal, I think, really
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   kick-started at Google.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   He has to get some credit for it.
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   >> Absolutely.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   >> I mean, he's been big on this space for some time.
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   >> But it's obvious what Google's doing, right?
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   I mean, it's like, if you can't own a space, what's the next best thing to do?
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   >> Create a standard.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   >> No, fragmented, fragmented.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   So, you look at what they're doing in mobile, and you look at what they're doing in social
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   network.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   >> Oh, very interesting, yeah.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   >> They can't buy either.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   They can't displace the iPhone, and they're not going to displace the iPhone.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   They're not going to displace Facebook heads up, right?
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   They tried already in terms of social networking with Orchid.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   They know they can't win, so fragmented.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   It's a brilliant strategy to divide and conquer.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   >> Do you think they will not buy Spectrum in the auction in January?
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   >> You know, that seems to me like a high risk poker game.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   >> Why do that now, right?
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   If you could do this strategy, this is kind of a different part.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   >> You never know.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   Remember, we're talking about they could start investing in smaller companies and creating
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   like 1,000 flowers blooming and just make the whole thing open like the internet.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   You know, those guys are very principled guys, and Larry and Sergey run that company, and
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   they're visionary guys, and it's obviously they're not motivated by money.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   They're motivated by making an impact.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   >> Is that true, really?
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   You know them better than--
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   >> Absolutely.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   >> Yeah, you've dealt with them directly in business.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   >> I'm not like best friends with either of them.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   I met them both a couple of times when they were starting the company and later on, but
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   you know, I think that they are guys who are driven by innovation and changing markets.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   And I think it's probably very exciting for them on a very personal basis to evolve the
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   phone market.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   And you remember Larry went to CES two years ago and gave a keynote, and he basically was
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   like telling the electronics industry like get your act together.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   You know, why do I have to have 1,000 different plugs for all my different devices when I
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   travel?
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   And now the USB standard is evolved.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   He didn't do it.
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   But he's, you know, those guys, I think, can dictate good behavior.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   And they did that with the recent rejiggering of PageRank.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   They said, "You can't sell links.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   Everybody said, 'I can do what I want.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   It's my company, right?'
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   It's my website."
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   And they said, "Okay, do what you want.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   Boom, all of a sudden the gadget loses four points on their PageRank.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   And guess what?
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   I stepped in and other people stepped in and were like, 'Hey, time out.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   We'll do what you want.'
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   >> Whatever you want to say.
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   Hey, do you think that PageRank-- Boy, that was a big issue last week.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   Do you think that really was-- Is it a big deal when you lose PageRank on the Google
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   toolbar?
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   What does it mean even?
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   >> It was their old way of saying how important you are related to up sites.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   >> On a scale of zero to ten, Google being ten, by the way, Yahoo being nine.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   >> Yeah, not scaping a nine, you know, whatever.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   You know, getting a blog up to six or seven is incredible, let alone eight, which I think
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   I'm a six or seven somewhere.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   >> Which is incredible.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   It means you've been around for a long time and you're an authority.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   But it doesn't-- They've played that down a little bit.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   They look at other things like--
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   >> And you rank that highly.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   >> It helps.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   >> It's a number.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   >> I've often wondered about those numbers.
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   I have verified about somewhere around 150,000 unique visitors a month, which is not a bad
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   circulation for a magazine.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   And that's, you know, several million hits, whatever that means.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   But I have never ranked anywhere on any of those things that show page ranks and so forth.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   I don't even appear.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   And yet I know I have more readers than a number of people who--
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   >> Because nobody links to you, right, Jerry?
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   I mean, that's what they're looking at.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   >> It made me-- I mean, they read my stuff and probably--
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   >> Yeah, but I have quite a few subscribers on the voluntary subscription plan, you know,
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   if you like what I'm doing.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   >> I'm using that.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   >> Send me money and if you don't, then don't.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   But it's free, but--
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   >> It makes sense what you're saying because here it is you have something that's widely
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   read.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   I mean, 150,000 unique puts you in Wired magazine territory.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   I mean, it's widely read.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   And yet because you don't have incoming links, Google says, well, you're not as important.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   Obviously, incoming links isn't the only thing that's important.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   >> That's what Google's going to find out.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   >> I have never been able to figure out how those ratings work.
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   I mean, I think that's quite a sign.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   >> I think Google doesn't want you to know necessarily how it works because then, you
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   know, if you know the special source, then you can mess with it.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   >> Google's all understood that.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   And what I mean is I don't think they work.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:47.000]   I think either people are paying to get those ranks or there is something strange going on
[00:12:47.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   and they favor people for some reason other than their circulation and popularity.
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   >> You're exactly correct.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   There's a lot of gaming that goes on.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   It's called SEO, Search Engine Optimization.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   And it would be incredible if somebody would come up with a solution for this.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   I don't know how they could ever neutralize SEO and create a search engine.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   >> But isn't the solution to pay no attention to it at all?
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   >> Yeah, except they have 60% market share and probably about 50 to 85% of people's traffic.
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   >> No, no, I have to have no attention to those page ranks.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   >> When you're talking about search, you have to have some algorithm for determining what comes in first, what comes in second.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   Page rank works well.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   That's why Google has 60% market share.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   It works.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   It may not map to popularity.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   It may not map to other things, but it does work for search, right?
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   >> Well, again, Leo, there are some topics that if you look them up, I am the first because I'm probably the only guy who wrote about the McCauley and the ladies of ancient Rome or something of the sort who done so.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   And very many people paid me attention.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   So it's not as if I don't appear on the search engines for a lot of stuff.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   So I'm just not sure I know what's, what is the bubbling?
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   That's not me, surely.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   >> Yeah, yeah.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   I see, by the way, before we go on, I just want to make sure I see Patrick just called in.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   We'll see if we can get him into the mix.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   It'd be very nice to have him here.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   Patrick, are you there?
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   >> Hey.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   >> Hey, Mr. Patrick Norton, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   >> Hey!
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:24.000]   >> He's the new Papa.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   >> Yeah, congratulations.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   I bet you're not getting much sleep.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   >> What's sleep?
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   I remember he's getting much of anything else.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   >> So how's it going?
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   How is, how is Seamus?
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   >> He's good.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   He's good.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:44.000]   A little concerned that people try, keep trying to put details of him in my Wikipedia entry.
[00:14:44.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   >> We were talking, you know, it's funny.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   We were talking about that off Mike ahead of time.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   And I won't say with whom, but about privacy and protecting your privacy.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   And Jerry, like me, has been in the past fairly, we've been fairly forward about our families,
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   sometimes to my regret.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   So you don't want any personal information about your family to go out there.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   You've always been very private.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   >> Yeah, I'd like, it's my wife and I would like as little as possible.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   >> Yeah, I don't blame you.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   >> Well, the other thing is, you know, we've had stuff like our wedding pictures are now anchoring
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   a link to somebody's eBay page in Oklahoma.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   So next time I drive cross-country, I have to go visit them and politely ask them to quit it.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   >> What?
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   >> I have to say, I have to say, I have to say, I have to say, I have to say, I have to say,
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   I have to say, I have to say, I have to say, I have to say, I have to say, I have to say,

[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:13.000]   hey, if you ever need a job, become the abudzmann from a hollow and just tell us what we're doing right, what we're doing wrong, and just, every day, talk about how we could do our job better and talk about the search space and social work.
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:16.000]   Right. That's just, it's advertising. I mean, it's just bad.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:21.000]   I mean, but he could just do it credibly and just talk about it. And that's why I said abudzmann because he could just kick our ass if we needed to ask,
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:26.000]   kick and I'm going to get famous so people can like use me for traction and pay me a squat load of money.
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:33.000]   I think basically everybody who everybody who's in your social network is worth a dollar to the employer. 50 cents per dollar.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:39.000]   I'm starting to add. Okay, I just want everybody to know I will add from now on everybody I turned down on Facebook. I am so, so sorry.
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:43.000]   I will add you. But the problem is Facebook stops at 5000.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:47.000]   Currently, currently, then you start, you know, you start something.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:50.000]   I just killed my MySpace account because my son got into it.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:55.000]   And I think he's now all these strippers are on the front page. I don't understand it.
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000]   He's not a brand.
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:01.000]   [laughter]
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:06.000]   So maybe I should. So what else Facebook, Twitter?
[01:05:06.000 --> 01:05:09.000]   Facebook, Twitter, create a Ning group.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:17.000]   You have a delicious account. What I realized was you can actually build your network on delicious and have a bunch of people who are in your network there.
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:30.000]   And when you share stuff, you know, people have opted in. So they listen and, you know, my blog, the number one, two, three, four, or far as our social networks, whether it's Facebook or Twitter or Pounce or Jiku.
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000]   The only one that's greater is Google.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:35.000]   Even YouTube is an incredible way to get traffic.
[01:05:35.000 --> 01:05:42.000]   Like we started making recordings of video games that we're covering on Mahalo.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:47.000]   We put them on YouTube and they get 40,000 views there and, you know, 10% of the people wind up clicking back through to Mahalo.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:50.000]   So YouTube is actually a marketing vehicle for people.
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:52.000]   Social networks are amplifiers.
[01:05:52.000 --> 01:05:54.000]   How many clickers are you getting on that?
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:55.000]   From YouTube?
[01:05:55.000 --> 01:05:56.000]   It could be like five or 10%.
[01:05:56.000 --> 01:05:59.000]   Okay. Sorry. I thought you said 40%. I was like, "Oh my God."
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:11.000]   But I mean, like if Jerry, if you talked about your book and what you were thinking and made a little video and put it on YouTube and then syndicated that to your Facebook page and other places, people would read it and they would click through and you would have thousands of people.
[01:06:11.000 --> 01:06:14.000]   I mean, it takes effort, but if you look at Scoble, he's a machine.
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:18.000]   When he mentions something, it gets 10, 20,000 people know what it is.
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.000]   Maybe 50,000 sometimes.
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:26.000]   He sent the shh bike when he did that whole like Facebook and Mahalo and are going to change how people search.
[01:06:26.000 --> 01:06:28.000]   Oh, yeah. That was good.
[01:06:28.000 --> 01:06:29.000]   Yeah.
[01:06:29.000 --> 01:06:30.000]   Technical here.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:35.000]   In doing that, is it worth going through and doing it in high depth or?
[01:06:35.000 --> 01:06:37.000]   Doesn't matter.
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:38.000]   It doesn't matter.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:39.000]   Yeah.
[01:06:39.000 --> 01:06:40.000]   Not important at the stage in the game.
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:41.000]   In fact, probably better not.
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:43.000]   It's going to be flash anyway, so it doesn't matter.
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.000]   Yeah.
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:48.000]   Everything goes through YouTube gets recompressed and they're relatively lower.
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.000]   For essentially a regular JVC 500 dollar camera.
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.000]   Oh, be fine.
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:53.000]   Be fine.
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:56.000]   You know, somebody just sent me a Vimeo.
[01:06:56.000 --> 01:06:58.000]   Vimeo is doing HD flash now.
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.000]   Actually, I was surprised how good that could look.
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:01.000]   But who cares?
[01:07:01.000 --> 01:07:02.000]   It doesn't, you don't need that.
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:03.000]   It's just you.
[01:07:03.000 --> 01:07:04.000]   It's you talking.
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:05.000]   Look at what we're sending out here.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:06.000]   We're sending out 64 kilobit audio.
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.000]   People listen to it.
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:11.000]   I don't think the quality of the audio or the videos, what matters.
[01:07:11.000 --> 01:07:12.000]   It's the content.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000]   I am going to wrap this up.
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:16.000]   And this has been one of the best shows ever.
[01:07:16.000 --> 01:07:18.000]   I really thank you all for being here.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:19.000]   Fascinating stuff.
[01:07:19.000 --> 01:07:20.000]   I hate to stop.
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000]   Two-parter.
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:25.000]   We could, yeah, we don't do two-par twists, but I'll tell you what, I will invite you back next week.
[01:07:25.000 --> 01:07:26.000]   How about that?
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:27.000]   Oh, man.
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:28.000]   I'm in.
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:29.000]   Jason, you're no longer on the B-list.
[01:07:29.000 --> 01:07:30.000]   I'm going to promote you up.
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:31.000]   Really?
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:34.000]   But why don't you wait to see how much cake now you get for this one?
[01:07:34.000 --> 01:07:35.000]   Before you make that off.
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:36.000]   I'm a great golfer.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.000]   I'm a great golfer.
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:39.000]   Jason, still smarting from episode 57.
[01:07:39.000 --> 01:07:40.000]   Classic.
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:41.000]   What are you talking about?
[01:07:41.000 --> 01:07:42.000]   Smarting.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:43.000]   It was like a virtuoso performance.
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:44.000]   I thought it was great.
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:46.000]   And I loved it.
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:47.000]   And you know what?
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000]   Many people, that's an example of it.
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:50.000]   It doesn't matter what you do.
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000]   I still get email people saying that was a great episode.
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:53.000]   That episode.
[01:07:53.000 --> 01:07:54.000]   Of course.
[01:07:54.000 --> 01:07:55.000]   Andrew Barron telling me that I was a failure.
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.000]   Yeah.
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.000]   Yeah.
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.000]   And he was going to be the next Rupert Murdoch.
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:07:59.000]   Absolutely.
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:00.000]   Man.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:02.000]   Yeah, I get conversations about that show too.
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.000]   Is that funny?
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.000]   I love it.
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:06.000]   That's why I love this business.
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:07.000]   People know that.
[01:08:07.000 --> 01:08:12.000]   Let me point out that this time I reset my VISTA machine before we started.
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.000]   It worked great.
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.000]   It hasn't died on me.
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.000]   It worked great.
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000]   My VISTA machine.
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.000]   There's a ringing endorsement.
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:20.000]   I'm just eating as entitled.
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:22.000]   It hasn't crashed in an hour, ladies and gentlemen.
[01:08:22.000 --> 01:08:24.000]   I guess the bomber is breaking a desk.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:29.000]   Jerry, you may have remembered the last time I was owed it crashed twice.
[01:08:29.000 --> 01:08:30.000]   I know.
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.000]   I know.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:33.000]   And I could hear you but could talk.
[01:08:33.000 --> 01:08:34.000]   It was awful.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.000]   It was awful.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:36.000]   Windows Vista.
[01:08:36.000 --> 01:08:38.000]   Screwing a podcast everywhere.
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:39.000]   That's giant.
[01:08:39.000 --> 01:08:42.480]   Ladies and gentlemen, for the first time ever, our Audible recommendation is somebody who's
[01:08:42.480 --> 01:08:45.400]   actually on the show and I love that.
[01:08:45.400 --> 01:08:47.640]   Jerry Pournell has written so many good books.
[01:08:47.640 --> 01:08:50.440]   He's working on the sequel to Inferno, right?
[01:08:50.440 --> 01:08:51.440]   Inferno.
[01:08:51.440 --> 01:08:53.440]   I will get it out the door this week.
[01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:54.440]   Oh, this week.
[01:08:54.440 --> 01:08:56.240]   It's the sequel to Inferno.
[01:08:56.240 --> 01:08:57.240]   Inferno too.
[01:08:57.240 --> 01:09:02.840]   It gets to the publisher this week, which means you'll see it in stores in about a year.
[01:09:02.840 --> 01:09:06.760]   Yeah, publishers are very fast.
[01:09:06.760 --> 01:09:09.840]   They live in the modern age, right?
[01:09:09.840 --> 01:09:12.840]   I turn it in now and it'll be a fall book next year.
[01:09:12.840 --> 01:09:13.840]   What's the whole thing?
[01:09:13.840 --> 01:09:14.840]   We're going to work on that.
[01:09:14.840 --> 01:09:17.680]   Star Swarm is our Audible pick by Jerry, by the great Jerry Pournell.
[01:09:17.680 --> 01:09:20.920]   If you haven't read any of his books, this is one of your best you said.
[01:09:20.920 --> 01:09:21.920]   I love it.
[01:09:21.920 --> 01:09:23.360]   It's my best juvenile.
[01:09:23.360 --> 01:09:24.360]   Great.
[01:09:24.360 --> 01:09:27.320]   And you know, like all juveniles, it's like online juveniles.
[01:09:27.320 --> 01:09:29.120]   Adults can read them.
[01:09:29.120 --> 01:09:32.960]   But I think your teenage kids will love it.
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:33.960]   Can't wait.
[01:09:33.960 --> 01:09:34.960]   Can't wait to get it for them.
[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:36.360]   Thank you so much for joining us, Jerry.
[01:09:36.360 --> 01:09:37.800]   Don't forget JerryPournell.com.

[01:09:40.760 --> 01:09:41.760]   You do.
[01:09:41.760 --> 01:09:43.720]   I get it in the email and it's so nice to read it.
[01:09:43.720 --> 01:09:47.800]   I've been reading it for, gosh, has it been 30 years now?
[01:09:47.800 --> 01:09:50.840]   At least I think the first one was in 1979.
[01:09:50.840 --> 01:09:51.840]   Unbelievable.
[01:09:51.840 --> 01:09:57.040]   So almost 30 years and it is still, it's the column that inspired me.
[01:09:57.040 --> 01:09:58.040]   JerryPournell.com.
[01:09:58.040 --> 01:09:59.040]   And thank you for joining us, Jerry.

[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:10.280]   Huh?
[01:10:10.280 --> 01:10:11.280]   Close enough.
[01:10:11.280 --> 01:10:12.280]   M-A-H-A-L-O.
[01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:13.800]   I don't know how to spit.
[01:10:13.800 --> 01:10:14.800]   It's in Hawaiian.
[01:10:14.800 --> 01:10:17.280]   M-A-A, you know, just say Mahalo.
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:18.280]   Mahalo.
[01:10:18.280 --> 01:10:19.280]   I mean, thank you.
[01:10:19.280 --> 01:10:20.280]   Or just to what?

[01:10:47.640 --> 01:10:48.640]   Very, very good.
[01:10:48.640 --> 01:10:50.840]   We had some good, lots of people watching the videos.
[01:10:50.840 --> 01:11:00.840]   We had some good views on our ACES, the EPC thing, and we had one of our videos of
[01:11:00.840 --> 01:11:03.360]   play digital, our video game show, went really big last week.
[01:11:03.360 --> 01:11:04.760]   So that was really cool as well.

[01:11:05.760 --> 01:11:09.040]   So everyone just go and watch it and subscribe and enjoy the show.
[01:11:09.040 --> 01:11:12.160]   If I hate the triple EPC, it's because of you because that's why I bought it.
