[00:00:06.840 --> 00:00:09.000]   We're going to talk about the most important transition
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.040]   in computing in years.
[00:00:11.040 --> 00:00:13.360]   The Apple move to Apple Silicon.
[00:00:13.360 --> 00:00:15.120]   This is an all Apple show.
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:18.520]   So if you don't care, maybe you should skip to next week
[00:00:18.520 --> 00:00:20.080]   because that's what we're going to talk about.
[00:00:20.080 --> 00:00:21.520]   And there is a lot to say.
[00:00:21.520 --> 00:00:22.360]   Stay tuned.

[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.560]   [MUSIC PLAYING]
[00:02:26.560 --> 00:02:33.320]   It's time for "Twit" this week in Tech,
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.760]   the show we cover the week's Tech News.
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.760]   And there really is only one story this week.
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.480]   And that might explain the illustrious panel
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:42.600]   we have assembled from Mac Break Weekly.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:46.240]   Laurie Gill is here, managing editor at iMore.com.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:47.840]   And it's always a joy to see Laurie.
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:49.040]   Hi, Laurie.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:49.540]   Hi.
[00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:50.200]   It's great to see you.
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:51.400]   It's going to be here on a Sunday.
[00:02:51.400 --> 00:02:52.440]   Hope you're not talked out.
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:54.200]   We just did this on Tuesday.
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:55.280]   We're going to do it again on Tuesday.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:02:58.200]   I can never talk enough.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.680]   It's so exciting.
[00:02:59.680 --> 00:03:01.160]   OK.
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:03.400]   I'm really excited.
[00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:04.920]   I've been waiting for the show all week.
[00:03:04.920 --> 00:03:08.040]   Also, here, Jason Snell from sixcolors.com,
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:09.960]   my personal Mac guru.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:10.440]   Hello, Jason.
[00:03:10.440 --> 00:03:11.320]   It's great to be here.
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:13.120]   I'm sad I can't be up in the studio with you.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:14.480]   But you know, 2020.
[00:03:14.480 --> 00:03:16.000]   I was thinking that.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:19.120]   I was thinking that it's like, god, when usually Jason
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:20.560]   would be here.
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:26.640]   And we've been preparing for COVID for 15 years at Twid.
[00:03:26.640 --> 00:03:29.400]   So really, we can do our shows like this.
[00:03:29.400 --> 00:03:33.400]   But I do miss it meeting and seeing people in the flesh
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:34.560]   once in a while.
[00:03:34.560 --> 00:03:37.720]   Now I don't have to trust Comcast to stay up
[00:03:37.720 --> 00:03:39.760]   during the whole show if I'm there in person.
[00:03:39.760 --> 00:03:41.040]   Good luck with that.
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:45.680]   Also with us, your colleague from sixcolors, Dan Morin.
[00:03:45.680 --> 00:03:50.080]   Also a prolific podcaster in his own right.
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.440]   The two of you go do more podcasts than I do together,
[00:03:52.440 --> 00:03:54.520]   I would say.
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:55.040]   Good day.
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:56.160]   I know that's a lot.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:03:57.200]   That's a lot to say.
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:03:58.600]   Only so many hours in the week.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:03:59.520]   Let me tell you.
[00:03:59.520 --> 00:04:01.480]   Dan is also-- I didn't know this.
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:03.560]   But you're a novelist, too.
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:04.080]   That's true.
[00:04:04.080 --> 00:04:04.560]   Yeah.
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.560]   In fact, John loves your novels.
[00:04:06.560 --> 00:04:07.240]   Oh, thank you.
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:08.000]   That's very good.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:10.400]   The Galactic Cold War series.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.840]   I'll hold up a couple because they happened to me.
[00:04:11.840 --> 00:04:14.240]   Of course, they just happened to be on my desk.
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:16.040]   Conveniently.
[00:04:16.040 --> 00:04:17.480]   Conveniently.
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:20.720]   You know, I've seen those and I didn't push--
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:24.640]   I'm such an idiot-- to and to together that that's you.
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.480]   Oh, that Dan Morin.
[00:04:26.480 --> 00:04:29.680]   Different hat, but same words.
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:33.440]   How much of your day do you spend writing fiction?
[00:04:33.440 --> 00:04:35.520]   It really depends on whether or not I've
[00:04:35.520 --> 00:04:36.840]   got a project sort of running.
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:39.160]   I tried to do it in the morning for a few hours.
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.240]   But if I'm under deadline or something,
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:42.920]   obviously I spend a lot more time doing it
[00:04:42.920 --> 00:04:44.400]   if I've got a book under contract.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:46.880]   But I try to keep my hand in and do it at least for a couple
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:47.960]   hours in the morning when I get up.
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.360]   And I'm nice and fresh before I remember where we are
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:52.240]   and what's happening.
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:53.920]   I hate writing so damn much.
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:56.560]   But I realize that it's only a matter of time
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.440]   before I will have to give this microphone up and start
[00:04:59.440 --> 00:04:59.800]   writing.
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:03.760]   So I'm trying to write every day just on my secret block
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:06.600]   just to get that happen.
[00:05:06.600 --> 00:05:07.880]   It's like working out.
[00:05:07.880 --> 00:05:09.160]   You have to do it.
[00:05:09.160 --> 00:05:09.680]   You have to do it.
[00:05:09.680 --> 00:05:11.240]   It's true that muscle going, I think.
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:12.080]   You're all writers.
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:13.480]   Yeah.
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:16.800]   I wrote a post about it saying, my problem
[00:05:16.800 --> 00:05:20.120]   is I'm used to the most primitive form of communication.
[00:05:20.120 --> 00:05:23.920]   My brain thinks that my mouth spits it into a microphone
[00:05:23.920 --> 00:05:24.520]   and then it's done.
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.200]   And it's over and I can walk away.
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:27.320]   It's pathetic.
[00:05:27.320 --> 00:05:29.000]   There's no thought involved.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.320]   So--
[00:05:30.320 --> 00:05:32.000]   You're really talking yourself up there.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:33.200]   Writing is so hard.
[00:05:33.200 --> 00:05:35.480]   You have to think about it.
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.920]   You have to edit it.
[00:05:36.920 --> 00:05:38.120]   It's so much work.
[00:05:38.120 --> 00:05:38.600]   I really--
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:40.600]   You know, transcription technology is really improved.
[00:05:40.600 --> 00:05:42.280]   Maybe you should just speak into the microphone
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:44.680]   and then just have somebody edit those words and post them.
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:46.120]   Yeah, I tried that once.
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.680]   Did not work.
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:48.520]   Yeah, it's not the same as it is.
[00:05:48.520 --> 00:05:50.600]   You've got to do it by hand.
[00:05:50.600 --> 00:05:51.760]   But it is definitely hand.
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:54.800]   I've been looking forward to this show because I think--
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:56.520]   and you know what the timing is good because we've got
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:57.520]   nothing else to do.
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:06:00.840]   This might be the most important we can computing
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:03.400]   in this century for sure.
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:06.160]   Perhaps-- I don't know.
[00:06:06.160 --> 00:06:09.080]   Perhaps-- I can't think of another time with--
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:11.120]   even the Mac transition to Intel, I don't think,
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:12.640]   was this important.
[00:06:12.640 --> 00:06:14.680]   And of course, what I'm talking about is the World Wide
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:16.960]   Developers Conference kicked off on Monday.
[00:06:16.960 --> 00:06:17.720]   It was going all week.
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:20.120]   I'm sure that's all you guys have been doing all week long,
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:22.560]   which is why you're here to fill me in.
[00:06:22.560 --> 00:06:24.920]   I did watch the keynote and the State of the Union, which
[00:06:24.920 --> 00:06:28.160]   is the more tech-y kind of follow up they did on Monday.
[00:06:28.160 --> 00:06:31.480]   We even streamed both of those with commentary.
[00:06:31.480 --> 00:06:34.000]   And then I've been reading incessantly ever since,
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.840]   even to the point where I downloaded Xcode, the Xcode beta,
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:40.800]   picked up the--
[00:06:40.800 --> 00:06:45.240]   I think I started the Stanford CS193 course in iOS development
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:48.760]   and started to dig into SwiftUI because I
[00:06:48.760 --> 00:06:51.800]   think we are going to enter a new era of computing.
[00:06:51.800 --> 00:06:55.400]   And here's my-- and you tell me-- you guys could talk me down
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:56.680]   and say I'm full of it.
[00:06:56.680 --> 00:07:00.400]   But my thesis is we certainly began a new era of computing
[00:07:00.400 --> 00:07:02.320]   in 2007 when the iPhone came out.
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.120]   We didn't know it at the time, but that
[00:07:04.120 --> 00:07:05.480]   was going to transform computing.
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:07.560]   All of a sudden, the vast bulk of computing
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:09.440]   is now done on a thing that's in your pocket.
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:11.560]   It's always connected to the internet.
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:13.040]   It's omnipresent.
[00:07:13.040 --> 00:07:15.520]   Social media, Facebook and Twitter
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:17.880]   were begun on the desktop, but really wouldn't
[00:07:17.880 --> 00:07:21.280]   be as powerful as they are without the smartphone.
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.840]   That transformed everything.
[00:07:22.840 --> 00:07:25.680]   And Apple became, as a result, the most valuable company
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:28.880]   in the history of the world, now worth close to a trillion
[00:07:28.880 --> 00:07:30.240]   and a half dollars.
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.000]   They have hundreds of billions of dollars of cash.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.400]   They're a behemoth, a juggernaut.
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.760]   The iPad, which had a lot of promise 10 years ago,
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.200]   didn't really seem to take off.
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.600]   But what I think I didn't fully appreciate--
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:46.640]   I'm sure you guys did-- but what I didn't fully appreciate
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:49.720]   is that from day one of the iPhone coming out,
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:52.520]   Apple was preparing for something different.
[00:07:52.520 --> 00:07:54.360]   And certainly, once they realized how successful
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:58.320]   the iPad was, Apple started preparing with their own chips.
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.840]   They started moving to technologies like metal.
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:02.920]   They started to do a lot of things
[00:08:02.920 --> 00:08:04.880]   that's really accelerated over the last couple of years
[00:08:04.880 --> 00:08:09.760]   with things like Catalyst to move into a new world of computing.
[00:08:09.760 --> 00:08:14.120]   An ecosystem, they could utterly dominate.
[00:08:14.120 --> 00:08:16.480]   And that with the announcement that they were going to finally
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:21.440]   abandon an architecture that's been around since the '70s, x86,
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:26.480]   1974, x86, and move to Apple Silicon.
[00:08:26.480 --> 00:08:29.080]   This was the-- for me, the piece that--
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:32.320]   click and the whole thing--
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:33.360]   seem to come clear to me.
[00:08:33.360 --> 00:08:35.840]   We're going to transformational moment.
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:38.440]   Am I not Stan Moran?
[00:08:38.440 --> 00:08:39.440]   I know, not at all.
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:42.400]   I think this is a big deal from the perspective because--
[00:08:42.400 --> 00:08:45.120]   I mean, the iPhone, in the earliest days,
[00:08:45.120 --> 00:08:47.440]   they were still sort of figuring out where it was.
[00:08:47.440 --> 00:08:50.080]   But once they started rolling out their own processors,
[00:08:50.080 --> 00:08:51.960]   I think it was only a matter of time.
[00:08:51.960 --> 00:08:53.960]   And increasingly in the last several years
[00:08:53.960 --> 00:08:56.480]   as they put their own processors in like the Apple TV
[00:08:56.480 --> 00:08:58.680]   and the HomePod and the Apple Watch,
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:01.600]   you started to step back and say, why isn't this in the Mac?
[00:09:01.600 --> 00:09:04.520]   Why is the Mac now the only device they make
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:07.640]   that is running on somebody else's processor when
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:09.240]   they have done all this amazing work?
[00:09:09.240 --> 00:09:12.440]   Because we would keep seeing when the phones came out,
[00:09:12.440 --> 00:09:13.600]   they'd be benchmarking them.
[00:09:13.600 --> 00:09:15.000]   And these things would be off the charts.
[00:09:15.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   And you'd be comparing them against laptops.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:17.880]   And you'd be like, why?
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:21.640]   This chip in a phone is outpacing this laptop that costs
[00:09:21.640 --> 00:09:24.640]   twice as much and is supposedly like this really powerful device
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:24.960]   they make.
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:29.720]   Why can't they bring that ability over to the Mac side as well?
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:32.800]   And I think Apple has shown time after time
[00:09:32.800 --> 00:09:36.760]   that they love controlling the hardware, the software,
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:40.040]   everything, the whole device, because they can optimize it
[00:09:40.040 --> 00:09:42.360]   to do exactly what they needed to do.
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:46.520]   And I think that it is fundamentally a huge change,
[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:47.760]   obviously, for the Mac.
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.200]   But it really only solidifies something
[00:09:49.200 --> 00:09:51.600]   that we've seen with the iPhone and the iPad
[00:09:51.600 --> 00:09:53.160]   over the last decade or so.
[00:09:53.160 --> 00:09:56.200]   And famously, I think they originally started out
[00:09:56.200 --> 00:09:58.640]   wanting to build something like the iPad.
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.040]   And the iPhone ended up being kind of a diversion
[00:10:01.040 --> 00:10:03.920]   along the way, which is, of course, hilarious,
[00:10:03.920 --> 00:10:07.320]   because it's a huge, huge portion of their money now.
[00:10:07.320 --> 00:10:10.680]   But yeah, I think that now that they're putting everything
[00:10:10.680 --> 00:10:12.480]   they run on their own custom silicon,
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:15.800]   I think we've just dipped our toe into what
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:18.000]   is going to be an enormous change for the Mac.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:20.080]   And that's saying something for a platform that's
[00:10:20.080 --> 00:10:24.000]   undergone so many transitions in its history.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.160]   I think it speaks a lot to not just the future of Mac,
[00:10:27.160 --> 00:10:28.800]   but the future of computing in general,
[00:10:28.800 --> 00:10:33.280]   because if Apple is going to be competing in this space,
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:35.160]   in this processor chip space, Intel
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:40.480]   has to do something to match that so that PCs can build
[00:10:40.480 --> 00:10:42.200]   into the future as well.
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.040]   And this could also really just be a huge improvement
[00:10:45.040 --> 00:10:48.600]   for Microsoft and all the other chip makers,
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:51.000]   all the other processor manufacturers out there
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:55.360]   to step up your game, because now Apple's in the business, too.
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:11:00.160]   So you don't get to just sit back and be the kings of this realm,
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:02.840]   because somebody's coming to take your throne.
[00:11:02.840 --> 00:11:04.480]   What happens to Intel, Jason?
[00:11:04.480 --> 00:11:07.320]   Is it curtains?
[00:11:07.320 --> 00:11:10.200]   I really do wonder about that.
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:13.600]   It's not necessarily a fate of complete that Intel will
[00:11:13.600 --> 00:11:14.880]   need to step up its game.
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.960]   We've seen Microsoft experimenting
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:19.440]   with Windows on ARM processors repeatedly.
[00:11:19.440 --> 00:11:21.680]   They're back there again now.
[00:11:21.680 --> 00:11:25.400]   And maybe it's definitely positive.
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:27.600]   If I was Microsoft, I'd be looking at this and thinking,
[00:11:27.600 --> 00:11:29.080]   I want to do what Apple did.
[00:11:29.080 --> 00:11:32.600]   Maybe not with Qualcomm, let's say, or something like that.
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:35.000]   Why don't we redefine this and get away from Intel,
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.480]   because Intel isn't working for us either.
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:41.240]   So I do think it's really hard.
[00:11:41.240 --> 00:11:46.000]   The lesson that Steve Jobs learned and then put in Apple's
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:49.040]   culture from a very early point is don't
[00:11:49.040 --> 00:11:54.160]   rely on other people for your critical business infrastructure.
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:58.040]   And Intel was a convenient tool for Apple
[00:11:58.040 --> 00:11:59.920]   to get out of the PowerPC Alliance
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:01.640]   and get computers that were actually
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:04.680]   running at decent speeds when the PowerPC Alliance was lagging.
[00:12:04.680 --> 00:12:07.760]   But the iPhone, because it wasn't a computer,
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.640]   they got to rewrite the rules.
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:11.920]   They ended up developing their own processors for it.
[00:12:11.920 --> 00:12:15.480]   And you know they've been thinking, all this time,
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:17.240]   what if we could apply this to the Mac?
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:20.960]   What if we could get away entirely from being on--
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:24.160]   because I would wager that a lot of people's frustration
[00:12:24.160 --> 00:12:26.680]   with Apple's release schedule for a lot of their Macs
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:30.960]   the last decade has been because Apple was waiting for Intel.
[00:12:30.960 --> 00:12:33.760]   And Intel has had a really bad decade.
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.400]   So this is like the logical, I think, conclusion
[00:12:36.400 --> 00:12:40.760]   of what Apple learned from the iPhone, which is they built
[00:12:40.760 --> 00:12:44.320]   essentially the best chip design group in the world.
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:46.640]   And why would they not press their advantage?
[00:12:46.640 --> 00:12:49.000]   And I now suspect that the last two or three years
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:52.040]   of static Mac development is because Apple's
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:55.760]   been too busy redesigning their next wave of Macs
[00:12:55.760 --> 00:12:58.280]   when they can control all of the parts.
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:13:01.480]   Yeah, I mean, I've been depressed about the Mac for years.
[00:13:01.480 --> 00:13:04.080]   Maybe that's why I'm so giddy now.
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:07.920]   Because it's very clear Apple had not abandoned the Mac.
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:10.480]   They made noises, oh, we love the Mac.
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:11.960]   But this shows a lot of love.
[00:13:11.960 --> 00:13:18.200]   Because-- and incidentally transfers to the Mac
[00:13:18.200 --> 00:13:20.960]   a lot of the glow from the iPhone.
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:23.800]   Because now you have an ecosystem that's--
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:26.680]   and this was, I thought, one of the most important little
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.520]   footnotes of the whole announcement.
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:33.360]   iOS apps will run unmodified under their Macintosh.
[00:13:33.360 --> 00:13:37.320]   That means you have one of the most powerful ecosystems
[00:13:37.320 --> 00:13:38.040]   extant.
[00:13:38.040 --> 00:13:41.920]   It suddenly takes you from a 10% market share for Mac OS
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:46.200]   to almost equivalent competitor to Windows.
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:50.160]   You've got more than a billion devices running
[00:13:50.160 --> 00:13:53.440]   compatible operating systems on compatible chips.
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:56.040]   Dan, why didn't they do this sooner?
[00:13:56.040 --> 00:13:58.440]   Well, it's funny too, because they dropped it in that announcement.
[00:13:58.440 --> 00:14:00.440]   It felt like an aside, right?
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.360]   It was like an hour or five minutes in.
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:05.960]   That's the most important part of the whole thing, in my opinion.
[00:14:05.960 --> 00:14:08.120]   You know, I was taking notes and I had to like,
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:09.720]   almost stop and run the video back.
[00:14:09.720 --> 00:14:11.200]   I'm sorry, what did they say?
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:12.320]   What?
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:13.920]   Yeah, I think this is huge, right?
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:17.320]   I mean, they didn't do it sooner because fundamentally,
[00:14:17.320 --> 00:14:18.480]   it just wasn't going to work, right?
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:21.840]   Like, trying to figure out how to run these types of apps
[00:14:21.840 --> 00:14:24.240]   on the Intel architecture was going to be a pain.
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:25.920]   It was going to be an emulation, and it
[00:14:25.920 --> 00:14:27.080]   was going to lose the experience.
[00:14:27.080 --> 00:14:29.200]   So it's neither going to perform well, nor was it
[00:14:29.200 --> 00:14:32.160]   going to be a great way to use those apps on a device
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:34.440]   that is fundamentally not set up for that touch input.
[00:14:34.440 --> 00:14:38.640]   But between the ability to use the same silicon architecture
[00:14:38.640 --> 00:14:41.080]   and the fact that they have been rolling out keyboard
[00:14:41.080 --> 00:14:43.440]   and cursor support via like the magic keyboard
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.520]   and rolling that into iOS 13 earlier this year
[00:14:46.520 --> 00:14:49.480]   means that there's a lot less excuse around not being
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:52.000]   able to run those apps and have them run well.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:54.520]   And I think several of us think there's also probably
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:56.760]   another shoe left to drop there in terms of, well,
[00:14:56.760 --> 00:14:59.840]   you're porting over all these touch primary apps
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:02.080]   to your device that does not have touch on it.
[00:15:02.080 --> 00:15:03.440]   Yeah, what happens there?
[00:15:03.440 --> 00:15:04.480]   Interesting question.
[00:15:04.480 --> 00:15:07.240]   And does it mean that they might finally decide, well,
[00:15:07.240 --> 00:15:08.720]   you know what, the Mac can have touched too.
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:10.360]   It's never going to be the primary interface,
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:13.160]   but it's going to be something that's available as an option.
[00:15:13.160 --> 00:15:13.720]   Yeah, why not?
[00:15:13.720 --> 00:15:14.240]   Exactly.
[00:15:14.240 --> 00:15:16.240]   So it might make the-- yeah, it's
[00:15:16.240 --> 00:15:18.920]   hard to imagine them putting those apps there and saying,
[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:21.120]   you'll have a great experience with just your keyboard
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:23.320]   and trackpad like any other Mac app,
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:25.200]   because fundamentally those apps are not
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.440]   going to be designed for that.
[00:15:26.440 --> 00:15:29.240]   It also changes my perspective on Catalyst.
[00:15:29.240 --> 00:15:31.080]   Because I mean, I wasn't.
[00:15:31.080 --> 00:15:33.480]   I don't think alone at all looked like, oh, it's just
[00:15:33.480 --> 00:15:37.240]   a layer so that you can kind of weekly put your stock
[00:15:37.240 --> 00:15:39.320]   app on the Macintosh.
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:41.960]   Now, Catalyst has a completely different role,
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:43.640]   and Apple alluded to this.
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:46.560]   That's, you know, your app already runs in the Mac.
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:49.040]   That's if you want to make it even more Mac-ish,
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:51.360]   you can turn on the Catalyst framework,
[00:15:51.360 --> 00:15:53.360]   and now it's a full-fledged Mac app.
[00:15:53.360 --> 00:15:55.520]   And it adds some dimension.
[00:15:55.520 --> 00:15:56.360]   Go ahead, Jason.
[00:15:56.360 --> 00:15:56.720]   For sure.
[00:15:56.720 --> 00:15:59.200]   It adds some dimension to the idea of we've
[00:15:59.200 --> 00:16:02.160]   been talking about Catalyst, and their pitch was always
[00:16:02.160 --> 00:16:04.240]   make a good iPad app and then bring it over to the Mac
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:04.800]   with Catalyst.
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:07.320]   If you look at some of the changes in iPadOS 14
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:10.280]   that they announced, like drop-down menus and sidebars.
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:13.880]   It's got this strangely similar to Mac features, right?
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:16.000]   And I think that's the kind of holistic view
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.760]   that they want people to take is, look,
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:19.240]   if you make a good iPad app, you're
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.240]   going to add these features.
[00:16:20.240 --> 00:16:22.040]   At which point, it's a better Mac app.
[00:16:22.040 --> 00:16:23.680]   And then if you want to make it even better,
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:24.800]   you add Catalyst.
[00:16:24.800 --> 00:16:27.560]   Also, my understanding is that by, you know, essentially
[00:16:27.560 --> 00:16:30.800]   exporting a bunch of stuff from iOS and iPadOS
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:32.920]   in order to make Catalyst work, they were essentially
[00:16:32.920 --> 00:16:35.720]   laying the groundwork for ringing over all the other stuff.
[00:16:35.720 --> 00:16:37.000]   It makes all the apps work.
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:38.680]   So it was kind of a work in progress.
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:42.800]   But yeah, their goal here is sort of a multi-part, right?
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.920]   They want existing Mac apps to survive.
[00:16:44.920 --> 00:16:49.200]   They want all of the iPadOS stuff to run on the Mac as well.
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:54.160]   And then in the long term, you will use SwiftUI and Swift
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:56.440]   or whatever, and you'll write things that can run across all
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:57.400]   of Apple's platforms.
[00:16:57.400 --> 00:16:59.400]   But in the short term, they-- you know,
[00:16:59.400 --> 00:17:03.240]   we've talked about wanting an iPadOS laptop for a while.
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:04.840]   A lot of people have written about that.
[00:17:04.840 --> 00:17:06.400]   And I had that moment, just like Dan did,
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:09.720]   where I thought, oh, it's a MacBook,
[00:17:09.720 --> 00:17:12.600]   is the iPadOS laptop, especially if they have touch.
[00:17:12.600 --> 00:17:15.840]   Because as of, you know, when they ship these first laptops
[00:17:15.840 --> 00:17:18.760]   with the Apple Silicon, they'll have all those iPad apps
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:19.520]   on that Mac.
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:21.160]   Plus, it'll be a Mac on top of it,
[00:17:21.160 --> 00:17:23.360]   which is kind of mind-blowing.
[00:17:23.360 --> 00:17:25.480]   - What about, what do you say to people, Laurie,
[00:17:25.480 --> 00:17:27.040]   who are scared of somebody in the chatroom?
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:28.400]   Oh, that's it for Unix.
[00:17:28.400 --> 00:17:30.080]   That's it for the command line.
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:32.760]   That's it for, I mean, that's it for the Mac.
[00:17:32.760 --> 00:17:35.800]   It's, the Mac is gonna become more and more like an iPad.
[00:17:35.800 --> 00:17:38.120]   Do you see it that way?
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:43.240]   - No, in fact, I think Craig Federighi,
[00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:44.800]   when he was interviewed,
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:48.000]   oh, I can't remember which one I--
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:50.360]   - Yeah, he was on the talk show with Gruber.
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:51.200]   - Was it the talk show?
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:52.880]   - He did Mark, Mark has Brownlee.
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:55.520]   - Yeah, it was one of those where he talked about
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:58.720]   the fact that this right here, what we're looking at,
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:03.360]   is evidence that the Mac is not going to be an iPad.
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:05.760]   There are some things like right now, for example,
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:10.760]   they don't have any anything planned to offer bootcamp
[00:18:10.760 --> 00:18:14.560]   as an option that--
[00:18:14.560 --> 00:18:17.080]   - I thought that was really interesting.
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:19.720]   The initial reaction was that's a licensing agreement
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:24.720]   'cause Microsoft does not license windows on ARM
[00:18:24.720 --> 00:18:29.880]   to OEMs, right?
[00:18:29.880 --> 00:18:30.720]   So it's a--
[00:18:30.720 --> 00:18:31.560]   - Not yet.
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:32.400]   - Not yet.
[00:18:32.400 --> 00:18:33.720]   (laughing)
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:35.040]   - I believe that--
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:35.880]   - I don't really emotionally--
[00:18:35.880 --> 00:18:36.960]   - Or I mean, that's what I mean.
[00:18:36.960 --> 00:18:39.120]   It's you have to make a machine based on it.
[00:18:39.120 --> 00:18:40.840]   - Right, right.
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:42.720]   Yeah, so right now, for example,
[00:18:42.720 --> 00:18:45.040]   the licensing is not there, but,
[00:18:45.040 --> 00:18:49.320]   so there's, that's a thing that a lot of people,
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:50.480]   or actually not a lot of people,
[00:18:50.480 --> 00:18:54.040]   there's a certain portion of people want bootcamp.
[00:18:54.040 --> 00:18:56.600]   And they're gonna say, well, if I can't have bootcamp,
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:18:57.640]   I don't want an ARM Mac.
[00:18:57.640 --> 00:18:59.160]   - Federighi said, you know, they're gonna--
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.160]   - You're not gonna need it
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:02.640]   'cause it'll run under VM almost bare metal speed,
[00:19:02.640 --> 00:19:04.200]   so you don't care.
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:07.840]   - Which some people are gonna say, that's not true.
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:11.240]   I do care, and I'm not getting an ARM Mac.
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:13.240]   And those people, for them,
[00:19:13.240 --> 00:19:14.800]   that's what the Intel Mac is for.
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:18.440]   Because someday, when all of the Mac line
[00:19:18.440 --> 00:19:22.000]   is on Apple Silicon, that's gonna be a point
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:24.560]   where either bootcamp is back on Mac,
[00:19:24.560 --> 00:19:26.960]   or everyone will have realized, oh yeah,
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:29.400]   that was silly of me to think that bootcamp
[00:19:29.400 --> 00:19:31.080]   was the only way to have windows on a Mac,
[00:19:31.080 --> 00:19:34.080]   because virtualization really is actually better.
[00:19:34.080 --> 00:19:39.080]   Like, it comes from this idea of 10 years ago,
[00:19:39.080 --> 00:19:42.720]   I was, computing was like this.
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:44.920]   Five years ago, software was like this.
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:47.200]   And my brain is still thinking about the past
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.920]   and not looking to the future.
[00:19:48.920 --> 00:19:52.400]   So I'm already scared of losing these things
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:55.120]   that were 10 years ago, they were bad,
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:57.040]   but not realizing that that's actually changed
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:57.880]   at this point. - I kinda wanna--
[00:19:57.880 --> 00:19:59.560]   - Or maybe not today, but soon.
[00:19:59.560 --> 00:20:01.800]   - I kinda wanna Apple to dump bootcamp.
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:03.920]   That's a, who cares?
[00:20:03.920 --> 00:20:06.000]   - I've never actually used bootcamp.
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:08.440]   So for me, that's not an issue.
[00:20:08.440 --> 00:20:12.440]   I use the virtual machines to do it.
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:16.440]   But there are people who, they feel very strongly
[00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:18.080]   that bootcamp is the only way to do it,
[00:20:18.080 --> 00:20:21.040]   that virtual machines just don't do it as well.
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:22.400]   They have a lag or something like that.
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:23.760]   There are people that feel that way.
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:28.320]   So I think the key here for Apple would be to prove
[00:20:28.320 --> 00:20:32.200]   to them that a virtual machine is as good as
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:33.440]   or better than bootcamp.
[00:20:33.440 --> 00:20:35.200]   The only way they can do that is by providing
[00:20:35.200 --> 00:20:37.800]   the kind of software experiencing the speed
[00:20:37.800 --> 00:20:40.320]   and the processor that's needed to do this kind of thing
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:42.160]   to have people go, "Oh, that's silly.
[00:20:42.160 --> 00:20:46.880]   "Why was I such a stickler for this one feature
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:49.040]   "when actually that's not really an issue?"
[00:20:49.040 --> 00:20:52.880]   - I'm sure that Apple also has numbers
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:55.600]   on how many people actually use bootcamp.
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:58.320]   Is this a big enough portion of our market
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:00.320]   that we care about it? - Apple's funny though,
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:02.760]   because how many pro users are there?
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:05.440]   There are some users that because of their nature,
[00:21:05.440 --> 00:21:08.360]   you want to support even if it's a fraction of your audience.
[00:21:08.360 --> 00:21:11.280]   And bootcamp might be that because it's used by DevOps,
[00:21:11.280 --> 00:21:15.200]   Sysadmins, it's the kind of thing that,
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:18.520]   that might be an audience you want them by in Macs.
[00:21:18.520 --> 00:21:20.760]   Just as I mean-- - We're in a very different world.
[00:21:20.760 --> 00:21:23.480]   Like when Intel, when the Mac Intel split happened,
[00:21:23.480 --> 00:21:26.760]   or Mac Intel Switch happened, we were in an era
[00:21:26.760 --> 00:21:29.320]   where I feel like there was much more demand.
[00:21:29.320 --> 00:21:31.160]   People wanted to switch to the Mac,
[00:21:31.160 --> 00:21:32.800]   but they couldn't do it because they need the windows.
[00:21:32.800 --> 00:21:34.800]   They felt they need the windows. - Right, that's changed.
[00:21:34.800 --> 00:21:37.640]   - But not only do we have windows in
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:39.400]   like screen sharing environments, basically,
[00:21:39.400 --> 00:21:40.840]   where you can kind of have windows on demand
[00:21:40.840 --> 00:21:42.280]   if you really want it, not for games,
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:43.680]   but for apps and stuff.
[00:21:43.680 --> 00:21:44.800]   It's a very different world.
[00:21:44.800 --> 00:21:47.440]   I would not put it past Microsoft, honestly,
[00:21:47.440 --> 00:21:50.320]   that at some point here in the next couple of years
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:53.560]   that they make available a version of Windows on ARM
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:56.680]   that runs on Apple Silicon, it would not surprise me at all.
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:57.880]   It's just not there today.
[00:21:57.880 --> 00:21:59.840]   - If I were demo would do that. - And so, yeah.
[00:21:59.840 --> 00:22:03.160]   Exactly, and the Mac, I think it's so easy to look at Apple
[00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:04.760]   and the power it holds over its platform and say,
[00:22:04.760 --> 00:22:06.200]   well, they're going to completely lock it down
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:07.280]   because look at iOS.
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:10.360]   But I think the right way to look at the Mac on Apple Silicon,
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:12.560]   and they've shown this again and again now,
[00:22:12.560 --> 00:22:17.040]   is it's where the restrictions don't apply as severely.
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:19.240]   So there is Unix under the hood.
[00:22:19.240 --> 00:22:21.560]   There is the terminal you can compile software.
[00:22:21.560 --> 00:22:22.760]   You can download things.
[00:22:22.760 --> 00:22:26.040]   You're going to be able to download software on those Macs
[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:28.280]   from just random places on the web and run them
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:29.720]   just like you can on Intel Macs.
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:31.960]   They're not locking any of that down.
[00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:33.760]   So I think that's the right way to look at it.
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:35.040]   - They would be foolish too.
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:38.480]   Because as small as that audience is, those are developers.
[00:22:38.480 --> 00:22:41.840]   Those are the people you really want to keep in the fold.
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:44.560]   In fact, one of the secrets to Apple's success
[00:22:44.560 --> 00:22:48.000]   has been how quickly developers jumped on the Mac bandwagon
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:50.480]   'cause they had a command line, 'cause they had Unix.
[00:22:50.480 --> 00:22:53.440]   That was a big part of the success of OS X.
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:55.640]   - Plus it provides sort of a release valve too
[00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:58.080]   for all the people who do think that the iPad, OS,
[00:22:58.080 --> 00:22:59.440]   and iOS is too locked down.
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:00.880]   It's like, well, you've still got the Mac
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:03.080]   and now you'll even be able to run those applications.
[00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:04.240]   It provides them a place to go
[00:23:04.240 --> 00:23:06.360]   where it's like you can complain about how locked down this is
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:08.680]   but we still provide this other option
[00:23:08.680 --> 00:23:10.440]   where you can get all your Unix software.
[00:23:10.440 --> 00:23:12.320]   You can download software from anywhere.
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:13.160]   Go nuts, right?
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:14.880]   That's your small part of the audience
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:17.000]   but here is the solution for you, essentially.
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:20.240]   - Well, that's kind of my point with the ecosystem.
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:23.720]   Apple now has, I mean, it starts with the watch.
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:27.320]   The TV, the phone, the tablet, the computer.
[00:23:27.320 --> 00:23:32.160]   They can make an ecosystem that's completely interoperable,
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:35.400]   completely compatible, that builds one on the other.
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:38.680]   The synergy is mind boggling.
[00:23:38.680 --> 00:23:39.920]   And the other thing I would point out
[00:23:39.920 --> 00:23:41.280]   and it's probably coincidental
[00:23:41.280 --> 00:23:44.440]   but Microsoft decided to close all Microsoft stores
[00:23:44.440 --> 00:23:46.960]   forever this week.
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:49.520]   And maybe it's a coincidence.
[00:23:49.520 --> 00:23:51.400]   I'm not sure it is.
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:53.540]   Microsoft's been making interesting moves.
[00:23:53.540 --> 00:23:55.940]   We talked a lot about Apple on Windows Weekly,
[00:23:55.940 --> 00:23:57.420]   for instance, this week.
[00:23:57.420 --> 00:24:00.980]   Because ever since such in Adela took over Microsoft
[00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:04.380]   almost six years ago, it's become very clear
[00:24:04.380 --> 00:24:08.540]   that he is not a believer in a company powered
[00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:11.420]   by Windows and Office, which was what he inherited.
[00:24:11.420 --> 00:24:14.900]   He believes in the cloud and increasingly he's been saying
[00:24:14.900 --> 00:24:17.740]   things like we wanna be wherever our customers are.
[00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:20.500]   Their support for the iPad is actually,
[00:24:20.500 --> 00:24:22.740]   for Office was actually better.
[00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:25.620]   That was the best touch first version of Office,
[00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:27.140]   much better than all the Surface.
[00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:32.140]   So, I think honestly, Microsoft's looking at this
[00:24:32.140 --> 00:24:35.980]   saying, yeah, we're gonna leave x86 behind too
[00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:38.300]   'cause it's a dead, ancient, dead platform.
[00:24:38.300 --> 00:24:39.580]   We need to do that.
[00:24:39.580 --> 00:24:43.340]   We couldn't do that because we are so tight in legacy.
[00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:46.020]   We would have been slaughtered, but thank you, thank you,
[00:24:46.020 --> 00:24:47.020]   Apple.
[00:24:47.020 --> 00:24:49.340]   They were certainly part of the announcement.
[00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:53.740]   Office is already running on ARM on Apple Silicon.
[00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:56.460]   And I think Microsoft's just gonna say,
[00:24:56.460 --> 00:24:59.460]   yeah, really our business is services in the cloud
[00:24:59.460 --> 00:25:01.700]   and we don't care what you're using.
[00:25:01.700 --> 00:25:03.300]   And they're not, I don't think they're tied
[00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:04.980]   to Windows particularly.
[00:25:04.980 --> 00:25:08.820]   >> Feels very like IBM 20 or 30 years ago too.
[00:25:08.820 --> 00:25:10.660]   >> Yeah, same transition.
[00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:12.420]   >> Yeah, I think Windows for them,
[00:25:12.420 --> 00:25:15.260]   somebody's saying the chairman is a legacy product line.
[00:25:15.260 --> 00:25:16.780]   Office is not.
[00:25:16.780 --> 00:25:19.020]   And that's why I wasn't at all surprised to see them
[00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:22.020]   developing Office for Apple Silicon.
[00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:24.380]   >> Well, Windows, I mean, people talk to me a lot
[00:25:24.380 --> 00:25:26.580]   about the whole argument of,
[00:25:26.580 --> 00:25:29.740]   Apple says you can't do touch on a desktop OS
[00:25:29.740 --> 00:25:32.340]   and Microsoft says you can and who's right and who's wrong.
[00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:34.700]   And the truth is they're both coming at it
[00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:36.860]   from opposite directions headed for the same point
[00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:39.020]   in the center, which is this converged device
[00:25:39.020 --> 00:25:40.380]   that can do touch and all of that.
[00:25:40.380 --> 00:25:44.540]   But the reason that Microsoft has been struggling here
[00:25:44.540 --> 00:25:48.220]   is because Windows, all the power of Windows
[00:25:48.220 --> 00:25:51.340]   is in its existence as a legacy product.
[00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:55.420]   And it is there because everybody has Windows,
[00:25:55.420 --> 00:25:57.420]   but it makes it very hard for Microsoft
[00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:00.340]   to do anything with it other than maintain it.
[00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:01.820]   So yeah, if I were such a Nadella,
[00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:04.420]   it would be like, again, it's very profitable,
[00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:05.620]   it's very successful.
[00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:07.380]   It's also an Albatross.
[00:26:07.380 --> 00:26:09.260]   So how do you deal with that?
[00:26:09.260 --> 00:26:11.460]   And when you look at what Apple did,
[00:26:11.460 --> 00:26:14.100]   Apple could have, and I would argue maybe a few years ago
[00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:16.100]   did view the Mac the same way.
[00:26:16.100 --> 00:26:18.260]   And I think Apple finally decided
[00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:19.820]   they were gonna bring the Mac forward
[00:26:19.820 --> 00:26:21.980]   which was gonna require it to change
[00:26:21.980 --> 00:26:24.180]   'cause they weren't gonna make it a legacy platform
[00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:26.940]   and that that would anger some people and it has,
[00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:28.660]   but that they were gonna push it forward.
[00:26:28.660 --> 00:26:32.700]   And Microsoft, I sometimes think it's just gonna realize
[00:26:32.700 --> 00:26:34.780]   that the people who are there
[00:26:34.780 --> 00:26:37.620]   because they've been on Windows for 20 years
[00:26:37.620 --> 00:26:39.940]   is not a growth business for them
[00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:42.180]   and they don't wanna support that anymore.
[00:26:42.180 --> 00:26:43.300]   - Well, we're gonna push them,
[00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:45.780]   and I think it's pretty clear,
[00:26:45.780 --> 00:26:46.740]   and it's the right way to go.
[00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:49.660]   We have Macs everywhere except the business office
[00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:52.940]   where they're using Windows is to thin clients.
[00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:56.420]   There's no reason they should be running powerful computers
[00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:58.020]   on X86 chips.
[00:26:58.020 --> 00:26:59.500]   They just need something.
[00:26:59.500 --> 00:27:01.460]   It's QuickBooks went through this transition.
[00:27:01.460 --> 00:27:03.660]   A lot of people were running QuickBooks on-prem,
[00:27:03.660 --> 00:27:05.900]   on the hard drive with a computer,
[00:27:05.900 --> 00:27:08.180]   but at some point they start using QuickBooks in the cloud
[00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:09.220]   and then it doesn't matter what.
[00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:09.740]   You could use it on-
[00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:11.300]   - Yeah. - You could use it on Apple,
[00:27:11.300 --> 00:27:12.460]   you could use it on Windows.
[00:27:12.460 --> 00:27:14.460]   And I think that's what Microsoft figures business
[00:27:14.460 --> 00:27:16.860]   is gonna do over the next five to 10 years.
[00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:18.660]   There's no, it doesn't make sense.
[00:27:18.660 --> 00:27:21.300]   It's really a nightmare just with ransomware
[00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:22.780]   and everything else for a business
[00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:25.220]   to be running computing power on the desktop.
[00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:28.300]   - Like 15 years ago when the Intel transition happened,
[00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:30.300]   everybody was like, "Oh good, I can run my dentist
[00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:32.860]   "off a software or my whatever Windows software on it."
[00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:34.660]   But I think about it today and I think
[00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:37.220]   that stuff isn't going cross-platform.
[00:27:37.220 --> 00:27:39.060]   That stuff is going to the cloud.
[00:27:39.060 --> 00:27:42.180]   And once it's in the cloud, it doesn't matter what computer.
[00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:44.220]   And I know that there's so legacy software out there,
[00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:46.380]   but it's not gonna matter
[00:27:46.380 --> 00:27:49.100]   because everybody is gonna convert that service
[00:27:49.100 --> 00:27:51.580]   into the cloud because then it can run everywhere
[00:27:51.580 --> 00:27:53.260]   on all devices and that's better.
[00:27:53.260 --> 00:27:55.700]   - So maybe Windows embedded is the future.
[00:27:55.700 --> 00:27:56.540]   (laughs)
[00:27:56.540 --> 00:27:57.380]   - I don't know.
[00:27:57.380 --> 00:27:58.220]   - Right.
[00:27:58.220 --> 00:28:00.380]   - The flip side to that too is just the number of,
[00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:02.620]   the sheer number of apps as we discussed before
[00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:05.180]   on the iOS and iPad OS platforms as well, right?
[00:28:05.180 --> 00:28:07.580]   There's a lot of these things that also exist there.
[00:28:07.580 --> 00:28:10.140]   And by opening that up, you start to have a lot more things
[00:28:10.140 --> 00:28:12.060]   where it's like, "Well, maybe this runs on an iPad."
[00:28:12.060 --> 00:28:15.780]   You know, you, if I were still allowed in coffee shops,
[00:28:15.780 --> 00:28:18.140]   every coffee shop around here that I used to go into
[00:28:18.140 --> 00:28:20.740]   had like an iPad or a tablet POS, you know,
[00:28:20.740 --> 00:28:22.900]   you go to the register and I check out with that.
[00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:25.020]   Like more stuff is moving in that direction too
[00:28:25.020 --> 00:28:27.260]   because that's where sort of the hot development is.
[00:28:27.260 --> 00:28:30.020]   So again, you could run all the cloud stuff on those
[00:28:30.020 --> 00:28:31.060]   oftentimes as well.
[00:28:31.060 --> 00:28:34.580]   So I think that the, definitely the focus is shifting away
[00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:37.140]   from these ideas of certainly not having like your old,
[00:28:37.140 --> 00:28:39.820]   I used to work in IT and deploy, you know, your monitor,
[00:28:39.820 --> 00:28:41.940]   your CRT monitor and your tower next to it
[00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:43.380]   and your keyboard and your mouse.
[00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:45.300]   And you're like, "This expensive, it's a lot of equipment
[00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:48.540]   "to maintain, it's just not where things are anymore."
[00:28:48.540 --> 00:28:50.580]   - Yeah, it's overkill too.
[00:28:50.580 --> 00:28:52.860]   - So for business, I can see this,
[00:28:52.860 --> 00:28:54.220]   what you're saying all making sense,
[00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:57.060]   but my question is what about PC gaming though?
[00:28:57.060 --> 00:28:59.980]   That's where I think that is not something
[00:28:59.980 --> 00:29:01.020]   that's going to the cloud.
[00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:04.820]   And Mac has so far not really been very successful with,
[00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:08.900]   you know, like the real gaming community on Mac.
[00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:10.780]   It's definitely a PC thing.
[00:29:10.780 --> 00:29:14.380]   So how does Windows continue to support?
[00:29:14.380 --> 00:29:17.860]   How does Microsoft continue to support PC gaming?
[00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:20.180]   Not console gaming, but PC gaming.
[00:29:20.180 --> 00:29:21.340]   - I don't think there's much future there.
[00:29:21.340 --> 00:29:22.700]   - I don't think that it's going away entirely.
[00:29:22.700 --> 00:29:25.260]   - Look at the PS5 and the Xbox Series X,
[00:29:25.260 --> 00:29:27.100]   the new gaming consoles.
[00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:29.620]   By the way, both running on ARM platforms.
[00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:34.540]   Look at Stadia and the cloud gaming services,
[00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:38.580]   Microsoft's XCloud, Microsoft's all in on XCloud.
[00:29:38.580 --> 00:29:41.100]   - Also, did you realize this was a WWDC session?
[00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:42.940]   I know Dan wrote about it this week.
[00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:45.340]   Apple now has full keyboard and mouse support
[00:29:45.340 --> 00:29:49.420]   on the iPad for games, which is kind of wild,
[00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:51.540]   but there are lots of other places to play games.
[00:29:51.540 --> 00:29:54.300]   And I get that you can't play PC caliber games
[00:29:54.300 --> 00:29:56.180]   in the way you want right now.
[00:29:56.180 --> 00:29:59.500]   But I think it will be interesting to see
[00:29:59.500 --> 00:30:03.660]   whether we need gaming PCs in five years.
[00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:04.580]   I think it's a niche.
[00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:06.660]   I think honestly the best corollary to me
[00:30:06.660 --> 00:30:08.860]   is like people working on classic cars.
[00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:10.780]   It's like your classic car still runs.
[00:30:10.780 --> 00:30:11.980]   You can still do it.
[00:30:11.980 --> 00:30:14.260]   But most people don't want to invest that time.
[00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:16.740]   Most people just want a car that takes them from point A
[00:30:16.740 --> 00:30:17.580]   to point B.
[00:30:17.580 --> 00:30:18.980]   And it's not going to go away,
[00:30:18.980 --> 00:30:21.140]   but it's already a small market.
[00:30:21.140 --> 00:30:23.540]   And I think it's only going to get smaller as the consoles
[00:30:23.540 --> 00:30:25.740]   and mobile, like basically squeeze it out.
[00:30:25.740 --> 00:30:30.820]   - I mean, yeah, gamers are allowed.
[00:30:30.820 --> 00:30:33.540]   And so, but I think about something like Fortnite,
[00:30:33.540 --> 00:30:37.180]   which was a PC game kind of platform,
[00:30:37.180 --> 00:30:39.980]   but it's completely cross platform at this point.
[00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:44.980]   And I don't think that to succeed as a game,
[00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:46.820]   any gaming company at this point says,
[00:30:46.820 --> 00:30:51.180]   oh, it's got to be on Windows, do they?
[00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:54.380]   - Well, so I think what the issue is right now
[00:30:54.380 --> 00:30:58.340]   with PC gaming or with computer gaming is that
[00:30:58.340 --> 00:31:03.060]   gamer, like PC gamers or computer gamers,
[00:31:03.060 --> 00:31:05.260]   they don't buy a Mac to game on.
[00:31:05.260 --> 00:31:06.900]   They buy a Windows computer to game on
[00:31:06.900 --> 00:31:11.140]   because of the ability of a Windows Mac versus the ability
[00:31:11.140 --> 00:31:12.700]   of a Windows versus Mac.
[00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:14.260]   So the-
[00:31:14.260 --> 00:31:16.020]   - Mostly that's by the way.
[00:31:16.020 --> 00:31:18.100]   - That's mostly Nvidia, by the way.
[00:31:18.100 --> 00:31:21.340]   It's 99% because of the GPU.
[00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:24.220]   - Okay, so exactly.
[00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:29.300]   So if Apple were to implement better graphic-
[00:31:29.300 --> 00:31:30.140]   - Yeah, what if.
[00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:31.140]   - And processes and things like that.
[00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:33.100]   That would definitely make a huge change.
[00:31:33.100 --> 00:31:34.900]   - What if some of the best GPUs
[00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:36.500]   are running on Apple Silicon?
[00:31:36.500 --> 00:31:37.340]   - What if?
[00:31:37.340 --> 00:31:38.180]   - Yeah.
[00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:39.700]   - Now what do you do, gamer?
[00:31:39.700 --> 00:31:40.540]   - Game company.
[00:31:40.540 --> 00:31:43.180]   - Apple, famously like Apple has gotten serious
[00:31:43.180 --> 00:31:45.940]   about gaming, like I think every five years or so,
[00:31:45.940 --> 00:31:48.540]   like they push, they really used to push gaming on the Mac.
[00:31:48.540 --> 00:31:51.220]   And it never materializes the thing.
[00:31:51.220 --> 00:31:53.220]   And I don't think fundamentally,
[00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:55.860]   I've thought they've always don't understand gaming
[00:31:55.860 --> 00:31:57.380]   as well as they understood some other things.
[00:31:57.380 --> 00:31:59.620]   Like when they really made their play in music,
[00:31:59.620 --> 00:32:02.580]   they're like, Steve Jobs clearly was a music aficionado.
[00:32:02.580 --> 00:32:05.300]   They clearly understood the appeal of it and how to use it.
[00:32:05.300 --> 00:32:07.460]   I don't think Steve Jobs ever had time for games.
[00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:09.860]   I think that was something interested him not at all.
[00:32:09.860 --> 00:32:11.900]   And I think that kind of filtered down through a lot of it.
[00:32:11.900 --> 00:32:14.340]   So it was never something they were really going
[00:32:14.340 --> 00:32:16.300]   to spend a lot of time on.
[00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:19.340]   But I agree, like the Mac as a gaming platform
[00:32:19.340 --> 00:32:20.860]   has always lagged behind the PC,
[00:32:20.860 --> 00:32:23.500]   but then the iPad comes out and the iPhone
[00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:24.540]   and all of a sudden people are playing
[00:32:24.540 --> 00:32:25.740]   a lot more mobile games as well.
[00:32:25.740 --> 00:32:27.700]   So, you know, the balance shifts a little bit.
[00:32:27.700 --> 00:32:30.820]   And again, I don't think that Apple's necessarily interested
[00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:33.180]   in replicating the PC gaming market,
[00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:34.860]   but it will be interesting to see
[00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:37.860]   once you can play iOS games on the Mac,
[00:32:37.860 --> 00:32:39.660]   how that's going to influence development
[00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:44.020]   and hardware and various like where the gaming crowd is going.
[00:32:44.020 --> 00:32:48.300]   - I would imagine the casual iPad and iPhone style gaming
[00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:52.100]   is probably a bigger market than PC gaming.
[00:32:52.100 --> 00:32:54.660]   I may not, I may be wrong, but I think so.
[00:32:54.660 --> 00:32:55.500]   - I think that's right.
[00:32:55.500 --> 00:32:58.420]   I think, but think about this though, if, you know,
[00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:01.340]   PC gaming was so big for a while,
[00:33:01.340 --> 00:33:03.620]   and then mobile devices came into our lives,
[00:33:03.620 --> 00:33:06.620]   and then mobile gaming has become this huge,
[00:33:06.620 --> 00:33:10.020]   you know, is monster of the gaming world.
[00:33:10.020 --> 00:33:13.820]   But now if we can play our mobile games on our Macs,
[00:33:13.820 --> 00:33:15.180]   there's going to be young people
[00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:16.980]   who are going to feel comfortable
[00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:18.900]   sitting in front of a computer playing games,
[00:33:18.900 --> 00:33:20.500]   not sitting on a phone playing games.
[00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:23.740]   Will that bring back desktop gaming?
[00:33:23.740 --> 00:33:25.260]   Let's call it not PC gaming,
[00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:28.460]   but let's call it desktop gaming or laptop gaming.
[00:33:28.460 --> 00:33:32.140]   Will that cause like the gaming industry,
[00:33:32.140 --> 00:33:35.540]   the game developers to start making,
[00:33:35.540 --> 00:33:37.740]   like really going, hitting down hard
[00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:41.740]   on making big games for computers.
[00:33:41.740 --> 00:33:44.060]   And, you know, by then will Mac, you know,
[00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:48.660]   just have a better reputation for being a good gaming Mac
[00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:50.820]   because that's where all these kids are now gaming.
[00:33:50.820 --> 00:33:53.700]   They're using mobile games on their Macs
[00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:55.540]   that they could port over from their iPad,
[00:33:55.540 --> 00:33:57.860]   but maybe that's part of the key
[00:33:57.860 --> 00:33:59.980]   of just generally getting people
[00:33:59.980 --> 00:34:03.900]   to consider a Mac gaming computer at some point.
[00:34:03.900 --> 00:34:07.260]   >> I wonder, I mean, there's this PC gaming enthusiast
[00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:08.660]   community and I don't know how big it is,
[00:34:08.660 --> 00:34:10.500]   but it's very active and very allowed
[00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:11.700]   and we're very aware of them.
[00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:13.500]   And certainly all the e-sports,
[00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:16.940]   all the successful e-sports are played on PCs.
[00:34:16.940 --> 00:34:18.780]   But I wonder if this community,
[00:34:18.780 --> 00:34:20.340]   if suddenly is looking over their shoulder
[00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:25.340]   and seeing that the Apple GPU is actually better
[00:34:25.660 --> 00:34:30.140]   than their Ray Tracing Nvidia GPU,
[00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:32.380]   if they wouldn't happily say, well, fine,
[00:34:32.380 --> 00:34:34.780]   then I'll put it on an Apple Silicon.
[00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:35.700]   I don't have a problem with that.
[00:34:35.700 --> 00:34:38.060]   >> There's no shame in saying, you know,
[00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:40.700]   PC gaming is a niche and Microsoft cares about it
[00:34:40.700 --> 00:34:43.540]   and the hardware makers care about it and it'll be filled.
[00:34:43.540 --> 00:34:46.340]   And it may go, it may continue and be fine,
[00:34:46.340 --> 00:34:50.780]   but PC gaming is one little part of Windows,
[00:34:50.780 --> 00:34:53.500]   like the big business thing,
[00:34:53.500 --> 00:34:55.460]   which is not even a niche, it is huge.
[00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:57.420]   That's the part where it's going to kind of evaporate.
[00:34:57.420 --> 00:34:59.900]   And look, if there are different hardware companies
[00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:01.220]   and software companies that are keeping
[00:35:01.220 --> 00:35:04.660]   the PC gaming thing alive, then more power to them.
[00:35:04.660 --> 00:35:06.100]   I don't think anybody saying, you know,
[00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:08.780]   PC gaming must die, but I do wonder
[00:35:08.780 --> 00:35:11.700]   if the trends in consoles and in mobile
[00:35:11.700 --> 00:35:14.660]   lead to a point where, you know,
[00:35:14.660 --> 00:35:16.820]   stuff doesn't get like canceled,
[00:35:16.820 --> 00:35:18.740]   like PC gaming is not going to get canceled.
[00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:21.060]   What happens is people look at other things
[00:35:21.060 --> 00:35:22.780]   and then it goes away and nobody notices.
[00:35:22.780 --> 00:35:25.220]   That's how things, that's how old tech dies, right?
[00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:26.460]   It dies with a whimper.
[00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:28.220]   And I'm just saying, if you look at the trends,
[00:35:28.220 --> 00:35:30.660]   you've got to wonder, is there enough there
[00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:32.900]   to keep PC gaming at the forefront
[00:35:32.900 --> 00:35:35.220]   or is it going to become less and less relevant
[00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:38.060]   until even the hardest core PC gamers have moved on
[00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:41.020]   to some other thing and it can just kind of fade away.
[00:35:41.020 --> 00:35:43.100]   I'm sure such an Adele wouldn't be too sad.
[00:35:43.100 --> 00:35:47.700]   - The current iPad Pro GPU, Apple claims to be equivalent
[00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:49.820]   to an Xbox One X.
[00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:51.700]   So they already have the equivalent
[00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:56.700]   of a high end gaming console in their existing iPad.
[00:35:56.700 --> 00:35:59.500]   - From 2018, basically. - From 2018.
[00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:00.900]   And I have to say, by the way,
[00:36:00.900 --> 00:36:04.620]   this explains a lot about that because the iPad seemed vastly
[00:36:04.620 --> 00:36:07.140]   overpowered for the tests it was given.
[00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:10.740]   It was like, why did you put so much power in this thing?
[00:36:10.740 --> 00:36:14.020]   Now we understand it was going to be the development platform
[00:36:14.020 --> 00:36:17.660]   for a whole new generation of Apple Silicon computers
[00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:21.540]   'cause that's basically what's in that development kit.
[00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:23.300]   - I think-- - Yeah, and my understanding
[00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:25.900]   is that that's also what they've been at least broadly
[00:36:25.900 --> 00:36:28.340]   testing on inside Apple is what is now going to be
[00:36:28.340 --> 00:36:31.420]   that development kit, which is that iPad 2018 iPad.
[00:36:31.420 --> 00:36:33.620]   - We don't know, they left out a lot of details.
[00:36:33.620 --> 00:36:35.660]   Like we don't know what these Apple Silicon,
[00:36:35.660 --> 00:36:37.420]   it probably won't even be called Apple to Silicon.
[00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:38.860]   They'll have some name for it.
[00:36:38.860 --> 00:36:40.260]   - Exactly.
[00:36:40.260 --> 00:36:42.460]   Some people, a very funny person on Twitter suggested
[00:36:42.460 --> 00:36:44.380]   that they call it the G6,
[00:36:44.380 --> 00:36:46.900]   like they just are picking up where they left off.
[00:36:46.900 --> 00:36:48.900]   (laughing)
[00:36:48.900 --> 00:36:52.020]   There's nothing inherently in arms risk architecture
[00:36:52.020 --> 00:36:54.980]   that means it couldn't be everybody.
[00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:57.500]   It feels to, I mean, honestly, I don't know why people
[00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:00.460]   are so reluctant to say goodbye to X86.
[00:37:00.460 --> 00:37:02.900]   This is an antiquated change out.
[00:37:02.900 --> 00:37:05.220]   - Just change it. - But it's such an antiquated platform.
[00:37:05.220 --> 00:37:08.140]   It was a horrible platform in the '80s.
[00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:10.060]   - Yeah, nobody ever thought like, you know,
[00:37:10.060 --> 00:37:13.500]   it was widespread and it was cheap more or less,
[00:37:13.500 --> 00:37:18.260]   but like it's not something that a lot of people were like,
[00:37:18.260 --> 00:37:19.180]   this is the best thing.
[00:37:19.180 --> 00:37:20.860]   I mean, even back in the PowerPC days,
[00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:23.540]   they were out speeding it, but the architecture,
[00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:26.020]   I think of the risk chips versus the Intel chips
[00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:28.620]   was not something that was like, this is better.
[00:37:28.620 --> 00:37:30.340]   They're like, no, it's good at these things
[00:37:30.340 --> 00:37:31.740]   and it's cheaper and it's everywhere.
[00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:32.580]   - Right.
[00:37:32.580 --> 00:37:34.980]   Yeah, better never won an argument in tech.
[00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:36.660]   (laughing)
[00:37:36.660 --> 00:37:38.940]   We all be using beta players still, right?
[00:37:38.940 --> 00:37:41.140]   - Better is not the argument.
[00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:43.900]   Compatibility, widespread availability and cheapness
[00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:46.500]   is what kept the X86 architecture alive.
[00:37:46.500 --> 00:37:48.260]   Intel wanted to kill it.
[00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:50.140]   Let's not forget they designed the I-Tanium.
[00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:53.980]   It was gonna kill X86, except it failed.
[00:37:53.980 --> 00:37:56.500]   It got so hot it melted.
[00:37:56.500 --> 00:38:00.780]   So X86 got a second life for another 20 years.
[00:38:00.780 --> 00:38:05.660]   I am, I for one am not sad to say, see you later, X86.
[00:38:05.660 --> 00:38:08.200]   And if anybody could do a better job,
[00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:13.340]   better than Qualcomm, better than Exynos, it's Apple.
[00:38:13.340 --> 00:38:16.700]   I think, and this is of course not as yet to be proven,
[00:38:16.700 --> 00:38:19.860]   I think potentially even better than Nvidia,
[00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:22.660]   Apple has a lot of brain power there.
[00:38:22.660 --> 00:38:23.500]   - Yeah, we'll see.
[00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:24.940]   And people should be skeptical, right?
[00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:28.220]   Until we see actual numbers from actual shipping max,
[00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:30.860]   not test kit max, but shipping max,
[00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:32.300]   people should be skeptical.
[00:38:32.300 --> 00:38:34.300]   I will however point out that if you look
[00:38:34.300 --> 00:38:38.300]   at the smartphone industry, Apple is so far ahead now
[00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:41.860]   that by the time the iPhone comes out in the fall,
[00:38:41.860 --> 00:38:45.180]   there's still no Android phone faster
[00:38:45.180 --> 00:38:47.060]   than the previous year's iPhone.
[00:38:47.060 --> 00:38:50.740]   They've essentially lapped the field on iPhone.
[00:38:50.740 --> 00:38:53.300]   And we know what the iPad is already like,
[00:38:53.300 --> 00:38:56.300]   in 2018 was faster than more than 90%
[00:38:56.300 --> 00:38:57.700]   of the PC laptop sold.
[00:38:57.700 --> 00:39:02.020]   So like I think Apple is gonna be super competitive
[00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:05.780]   and we'll see in processor probably in GPU,
[00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:07.460]   we'll see, 'cause they're gonna have to compete
[00:39:07.460 --> 00:39:08.660]   and they're gonna be judged,
[00:39:08.660 --> 00:39:13.660]   but they are in a really advantageous position right now.
[00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:14.860]   - Yeah, you make a good point.
[00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:16.780]   We're talking about enthusiast matters
[00:39:16.780 --> 00:39:19.420]   that people care about as enthusiasts,
[00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:22.140]   but the real world isn't gonna care about that so much.
[00:39:22.140 --> 00:39:25.020]   And Apple's gonna win on the, or they've already won.
[00:39:25.020 --> 00:39:26.100]   They've already won.
[00:39:26.100 --> 00:39:27.900]   - Yeah, I mean, more of the point,
[00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:29.780]   like these are, we've seen what they can do with the chips,
[00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:31.700]   they fit in a phone and a tablet.
[00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:35.500]   Like when they have an entire desktop or laptop infrastructure
[00:39:35.500 --> 00:39:37.780]   that they can roll in, like those,
[00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:39.460]   they are not held back by as many constraints
[00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:42.620]   in terms of, you know, power or space or heat.
[00:39:42.620 --> 00:39:44.780]   Like all of those things have to be much more carefully
[00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:47.940]   managed in a phone than they do in a laptop or desktop.
[00:39:47.940 --> 00:39:50.740]   So the potential gains there are even,
[00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:52.780]   again, as it said, we've got to wait
[00:39:52.780 --> 00:39:54.220]   until we actually see these things
[00:39:54.220 --> 00:39:55.860]   and know what they're capable of.
[00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:57.980]   But, you know, this is like a little bit,
[00:39:57.980 --> 00:39:58.900]   it's a little bit like them fighting
[00:39:58.900 --> 00:40:01.860]   with one arm time behind their back, right?
[00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:05.980]   - So let's not be a cheerleading squad.
[00:40:05.980 --> 00:40:07.300]   What could go wrong?
[00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:10.140]   - Lori, what could go wrong?
[00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:13.180]   - They could turn their back on back
[00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:17.180]   and turn it into an iPad, which is what some people
[00:40:17.180 --> 00:40:18.020]   are afraid of.
[00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:20.180]   That's a thing that we could be afraid of.
[00:40:20.180 --> 00:40:21.180]   I know that they're--
[00:40:21.180 --> 00:40:22.740]   - I feel like this is-- - They're staying right now.
[00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:24.260]   - This was where they said no.
[00:40:24.260 --> 00:40:26.100]   This was where they proved to me no,
[00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:27.540]   that they're not going to do that.
[00:40:27.540 --> 00:40:29.700]   - Right, right, but you know, and I agree with that,
[00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:32.420]   but they also said they were never going to make a tiny iPad
[00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:34.620]   and they also said they were never going to make a giant iPhone.
[00:40:34.620 --> 00:40:38.500]   So we, like, if we're talking about what potentially goes,
[00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:40.300]   could go wrong to me,
[00:40:40.300 --> 00:40:42.740]   that's probably the biggest fear
[00:40:42.740 --> 00:40:44.460]   that Mac users have right now.
[00:40:44.460 --> 00:40:47.900]   Not that the arm chip won't be as good,
[00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:50.660]   you know, they could just go back to Intel, no big deal,
[00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:52.940]   but that they will move forward
[00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:55.620]   and that they will actually eliminate Mac OS
[00:40:55.620 --> 00:40:57.260]   and replace it with iPad OS.
[00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:59.820]   That's probably the biggest thing that could go wrong.
[00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:03.300]   - In a way, the risk that they would make chips
[00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:05.620]   that wouldn't live up to the promise
[00:41:05.620 --> 00:41:07.660]   is not a problem because they already have
[00:41:07.660 --> 00:41:09.380]   made chips to live up to the promise, right?
[00:41:09.380 --> 00:41:13.580]   So in a way, they've proven they can do the chips, right?
[00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:17.220]   - I feel like hubris is their biggest risk right now, right?
[00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:19.700]   That they're going to say, oh, we're on top of the world,
[00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:23.500]   we dominate here, we have the freedom to make some decisions
[00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:26.460]   and they're going to make some decisions that go wrong.
[00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:28.580]   I feel like sometimes Apple,
[00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:31.140]   this seems they're on top of the world in one level.
[00:41:31.140 --> 00:41:32.860]   And then when you're on top of the world,
[00:41:32.860 --> 00:41:34.260]   you are your own worst enemy
[00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:36.340]   'cause there's nobody else to be your worst enemy.
[00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:39.020]   And so like they haven't shown this,
[00:41:39.020 --> 00:41:41.500]   but what if they say time to close it off
[00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:42.860]   so it's only the Mac App Store,
[00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:44.060]   time to get rid of the command line.
[00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:44.900]   - That would be bad.
[00:41:44.900 --> 00:41:45.740]   - Time, right?
[00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:46.860]   - Yes. - I don't think they're going to
[00:41:46.860 --> 00:41:49.580]   because they could have done it now and they didn't.
[00:41:49.580 --> 00:41:52.220]   But that I think the danger where we've seen it
[00:41:52.220 --> 00:41:54.020]   with some of these App Store controversies, right?
[00:41:54.020 --> 00:41:55.740]   Where they're their own worst enemy
[00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:58.860]   in pushing it too far, in allowing the bureaucracy
[00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:01.700]   or in their motivation to increase their services revenue
[00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:04.620]   to go against what their customers want.
[00:42:04.620 --> 00:42:07.420]   I think that there's some serious risk in there.
[00:42:07.420 --> 00:42:09.740]   I guess the other risk would be on the Proend,
[00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:10.580]   what can they do?
[00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:15.580]   They have not been asked to do a Mac Pro kind of product
[00:42:15.580 --> 00:42:19.860]   which architecturally is very different from an iPhone, right?
[00:42:19.860 --> 00:42:23.900]   - Think how long it took for them to make the new Mac Pro
[00:42:23.900 --> 00:42:25.020]   after announcing it.
[00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:27.020]   It took them years.
[00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:29.940]   And that was on an architecture they already were working on.
[00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:31.940]   - Yeah, although you gotta know that that Mac Pro
[00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:33.940]   was built with them knowing they're going to arm.
[00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:36.380]   So I suspect there is a plan there of some sort.
[00:42:36.380 --> 00:42:37.940]   - In the lines, right. - We haven't seen.
[00:42:37.940 --> 00:42:40.660]   - Right. - But for the people who demand
[00:42:40.660 --> 00:42:41.860]   that kind of processor power,
[00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:45.060]   demand that kind of GPU power slots,
[00:42:45.060 --> 00:42:46.940]   how do you do, like there's so many things
[00:42:46.940 --> 00:42:47.900]   and we only have hints,
[00:42:47.900 --> 00:42:49.700]   like they change the boot process in macOS.
[00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:51.780]   That's an interesting example where they,
[00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:52.780]   I wrote a whole article about it.
[00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:53.620]   - What happened there?
[00:42:53.620 --> 00:42:54.460]   I didn't hear about that.
[00:42:54.460 --> 00:42:56.740]   - Well, iOS and iPadOS don't,
[00:42:56.740 --> 00:42:59.300]   they just boot onto the boot disk and that's it.
[00:42:59.300 --> 00:43:02.100]   And then the Mac, you can like hold down keys
[00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:03.780]   and you can do cover-y. - Right.
[00:43:03.780 --> 00:43:05.180]   - And you can boot into a different thing.
[00:43:05.180 --> 00:43:07.300]   And they had to add all of that to the boot loader
[00:43:07.300 --> 00:43:09.140]   that previously didn't have to do that
[00:43:09.140 --> 00:43:11.300]   'cause it was the iPad and iPhone boot loader.
[00:43:11.300 --> 00:43:12.140]   And they did it.
[00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:13.740]   They added all of that functionality
[00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:15.580]   so that a Mac behaves like a Mac.
[00:43:15.580 --> 00:43:17.860]   It makes me wonder actually if one day
[00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:19.340]   you might be able to partition your iPad
[00:43:19.340 --> 00:43:20.980]   and have two different versions of iPadOS
[00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:22.580]   and choose which one you wanna boot into,
[00:43:22.580 --> 00:43:24.060]   developers would love that.
[00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:25.380]   But they've got it on the Mac.
[00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:29.500]   So I feel like they're making those right decisions,
[00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:31.460]   but there's risk there.
[00:43:31.460 --> 00:43:35.060]   There is risk that they can't push,
[00:43:35.060 --> 00:43:37.580]   like they're gonna have to, let me put it this way.
[00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:39.100]   If you think about the trashcan Mac Pro,
[00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:41.300]   which was kind of a failure because they made some bad bets
[00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:44.140]   on technology and where they thought technology was going,
[00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:45.300]   there is that question of like,
[00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:48.700]   what if they make a bet about the GPU and the slots
[00:43:48.700 --> 00:43:51.060]   and the other high-end processing needs
[00:43:51.060 --> 00:43:53.860]   that their pro customers want in video
[00:43:53.860 --> 00:43:55.220]   and in other places like that.
[00:43:55.220 --> 00:43:57.820]   And they think they can do it and then they get there
[00:43:57.820 --> 00:43:58.900]   and they can't do it.
[00:43:58.900 --> 00:44:00.660]   That I think is a big risk.
[00:44:00.660 --> 00:44:01.500]   Not that they won't.
[00:44:01.500 --> 00:44:03.900]   I think that they probably have some great confidence there,
[00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:06.660]   but sometimes their confidence is misplaced
[00:44:06.660 --> 00:44:07.860]   and they've never done it before
[00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:09.780]   when it comes to this architecture.
[00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:11.140]   - Yeah, when you get that big, right?
[00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:12.260]   I mean, I think Jason's right,
[00:44:12.260 --> 00:44:15.060]   being your own worst enemy is the biggest potential flaw there.
[00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:16.660]   It's sort of buying into your hype, right?
[00:44:16.660 --> 00:44:19.340]   And that is certainly something that Apple has been accused
[00:44:19.340 --> 00:44:20.620]   of doing and demonstrated doing.
[00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:21.740]   We don't have to look much farther
[00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:24.020]   than the whole butterfly keyboard fiasco
[00:44:24.020 --> 00:44:26.380]   the last few years to see that they are willing
[00:44:26.380 --> 00:44:29.260]   to make design decisions that they are absolutely confident
[00:44:29.260 --> 00:44:30.460]   is the best thing ever.
[00:44:30.460 --> 00:44:32.380]   And then it turns out maybe it's not.
[00:44:32.380 --> 00:44:33.860]   Maybe that was a bad decision.
[00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:36.900]   And when you're that big a company,
[00:44:36.900 --> 00:44:38.340]   it's like turning a battleship, right?
[00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:41.220]   Like you can't immediately just yank everything
[00:44:41.220 --> 00:44:42.060]   and change it back.
[00:44:42.060 --> 00:44:45.060]   You're selling millions upon millions of units.
[00:44:45.060 --> 00:44:48.940]   So they have a lot of risk in terms of making a bad decision
[00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:52.060]   that is multiplied by the scale they're working at
[00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:54.620]   and really is going to be hard to dig themselves out of it
[00:44:54.620 --> 00:44:56.860]   if they do in fact make a bad decision
[00:44:56.860 --> 00:44:57.740]   somewhere along the line there.
[00:44:57.740 --> 00:44:59.500]   But yeah, I mean, once you've,
[00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:02.180]   we used to look often at Apple in terms of its rivalries
[00:45:02.180 --> 00:45:04.580]   like Apple versus IBM or Apple versus Microsoft
[00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:05.980]   or Apple versus Google.
[00:45:05.980 --> 00:45:07.540]   I don't think that's the case anymore.
[00:45:07.540 --> 00:45:09.860]   I think that Apple has kind of put itself
[00:45:09.860 --> 00:45:12.540]   in its own category, but that comes with a lot of risk
[00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:15.420]   because of that, 'cause when you're not fighting actively
[00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:18.180]   or defining yourself against your competitors,
[00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:20.980]   it means that you're not challenged as much necessarily.
[00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:22.900]   So you don't have to respond to them and say like,
[00:45:22.900 --> 00:45:25.220]   oh, they're doing this, we need to find a way to get better.
[00:45:25.220 --> 00:45:27.500]   We need to really like improve our edge.
[00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:28.500]   You get complacent.
[00:45:28.500 --> 00:45:30.940]   And that's a real risk I think with Apple here.
[00:45:30.940 --> 00:45:39.900]   - So what is, so I guess one question
[00:45:39.900 --> 00:45:41.500]   people are gonna be asking,
[00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:44.580]   should you buy a Mac now?
[00:45:44.580 --> 00:45:46.620]   (laughing)
[00:45:46.620 --> 00:45:48.260]   This would be a bad time.
[00:45:48.260 --> 00:45:50.020]   Should you buy an Intel Mac?
[00:45:51.020 --> 00:45:54.020]   - Always in motion, the future is, I believe.
[00:45:54.020 --> 00:45:56.060]   A wise puppet once said,
[00:45:56.060 --> 00:45:57.660]   "The truth is any computer you buy
[00:45:57.660 --> 00:45:59.900]   is already gonna be out of date, right?"
[00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:01.540]   But I drive it off the wall.
[00:46:01.540 --> 00:46:04.300]   Yeah, if somebody asked me this week, Leo,
[00:46:04.300 --> 00:46:05.460]   they actually asked me this this week,
[00:46:05.460 --> 00:46:07.340]   and I said, "If you need it right now,
[00:46:07.340 --> 00:46:08.620]   then go ahead and buy it."
[00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:10.700]   - If you had a kid go to college,
[00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:12.820]   if your computer died.
[00:46:12.820 --> 00:46:15.820]   - I bought my daughter a new laptop this week.
[00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:18.060]   - You got her 16 inch.
[00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:21.140]   - No, no, that was Greg Jawswiak,
[00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:21.980]   who did that.
[00:46:21.980 --> 00:46:22.820]   - That's right, Jaws did that, yeah.
[00:46:22.820 --> 00:46:23.940]   - I was smart, I got her a MacBook Air.
[00:46:23.940 --> 00:46:24.780]   - Much smart.
[00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:26.260]   (laughing)
[00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:28.540]   - If you had Jaws money, you might.
[00:46:28.540 --> 00:46:31.420]   - Maybe, but this is my point is,
[00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:34.060]   if you can wait, of course you should wait,
[00:46:34.060 --> 00:46:37.860]   because on the other side of this is the new era
[00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:40.580]   for the next decade or more of the Mac.
[00:46:40.580 --> 00:46:42.260]   If you can wait, you should,
[00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:44.340]   but it's not the end of the world
[00:46:44.340 --> 00:46:46.420]   if you buy a Mac this week.
[00:46:46.420 --> 00:46:47.260]   - You're still gonna support it.
[00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:48.180]   - It's still been for five years.
[00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:49.980]   - Yeah, it'll work for a long time.
[00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:52.100]   - Years to come, that's at least two.
[00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:55.380]   - Well, they still have their obsolete,
[00:46:55.380 --> 00:46:57.220]   like whatever they're required to do
[00:46:57.220 --> 00:46:58.580]   with vintage and obsolete hardware.
[00:46:58.580 --> 00:46:59.420]   - Is that seven years?
[00:46:59.420 --> 00:47:00.940]   - I would imagine, it's five, I think five,
[00:47:00.940 --> 00:47:02.500]   and then seven really before.
[00:47:02.500 --> 00:47:04.380]   - And if the transition lasts two years
[00:47:04.380 --> 00:47:05.540]   and it starts at the end of the year,
[00:47:05.540 --> 00:47:06.660]   that means it's gonna be,
[00:47:06.660 --> 00:47:08.460]   they're not gonna even have completed the transition
[00:47:08.460 --> 00:47:10.220]   until the end of 2022.
[00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:13.100]   And that means that in late 2022,
[00:47:13.100 --> 00:47:15.060]   you're still gonna be able to buy an Intel Mac.
[00:47:15.060 --> 00:47:16.700]   - No. - That presumably is gonna get
[00:47:16.700 --> 00:47:18.940]   support for two more years at least, so.
[00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:19.940]   - Stop.
[00:47:19.940 --> 00:47:21.260]   - It'll do not. - It'll do not.
[00:47:21.260 --> 00:47:23.380]   - Do not buy an Intel Mac if you can help it.
[00:47:23.380 --> 00:47:24.820]   - Try not to.
[00:47:24.820 --> 00:47:26.020]   - I remember, I mean, look,
[00:47:26.020 --> 00:47:29.460]   I bought G4s or whatever at the end of the long.
[00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:33.860]   Those things felt antiquated almost instantly, right?
[00:47:33.860 --> 00:47:35.180]   I mean, nobody-- - Well, that was probably
[00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:38.340]   a bit of FOMO, you know, 'cause here's the thing though,
[00:47:38.340 --> 00:47:42.780]   is arm, you know, who's gonna buy the first arm Mac
[00:47:42.780 --> 00:47:44.940]   is the other question, the other side.
[00:47:44.940 --> 00:47:46.980]   - The other side of that same-- - That's the question.
[00:47:46.980 --> 00:47:50.020]   - So if it's just, you know, your best friend
[00:47:50.020 --> 00:47:52.740]   or your cousin or your mom or whatever,
[00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:54.860]   should I wait and buy an arm Mac,
[00:47:54.860 --> 00:47:56.500]   my question is, well, I don't know,
[00:47:56.500 --> 00:47:58.180]   do you really wanna be the first person
[00:47:58.180 --> 00:48:00.380]   to have an Apple Silicon Mac?
[00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:04.300]   So maybe an Intel Mac is the right choice for people, right?
[00:48:04.300 --> 00:48:07.260]   Now maybe they want the last Intel Mac
[00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:11.500]   because maybe the Apple Silicon isn't gonna be totally ready
[00:48:11.500 --> 00:48:13.700]   and it might be great for us,
[00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:15.740]   'cause we're always on the cutting edge
[00:48:15.740 --> 00:48:16.860]   and we're getting things even though
[00:48:16.860 --> 00:48:18.140]   they don't really quite work right,
[00:48:18.140 --> 00:48:19.940]   they're definitely a first iteration.
[00:48:19.940 --> 00:48:22.740]   I wouldn't put one of my friends through that though.
[00:48:22.740 --> 00:48:24.740]   I would say, let me buy that one first,
[00:48:24.740 --> 00:48:26.900]   let me tell you how good it works,
[00:48:26.900 --> 00:48:30.380]   and then a year later, then you can get into that one, you know?
[00:48:30.380 --> 00:48:32.260]   - Dumb people like us are buying the first one,
[00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:33.780]   that's the answer. - Yeah, yeah.
[00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:34.620]   - I'm gonna go out on the limb,
[00:48:34.620 --> 00:48:37.380]   I don't think it's gonna take two years.
[00:48:37.380 --> 00:48:39.500]   They said two years for the Intel transition,
[00:48:39.500 --> 00:48:40.460]   it took nine months.
[00:48:40.460 --> 00:48:43.980]   I think they're over, under-probasing and over-delivering.
[00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:46.340]   - Agreed. - I think, you know,
[00:48:46.340 --> 00:48:48.700]   the rumor Ming Chico and others have repeated this
[00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:53.660]   is there will be a 13-inch MacBook Pro this year
[00:48:53.660 --> 00:48:55.740]   running on Apple Silicon.
[00:48:55.740 --> 00:49:00.740]   And probably, I think Ming Chico said all Macs sold in 2021
[00:49:00.740 --> 00:49:03.260]   would be Apple Silicon.
[00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:05.620]   I wouldn't-- - I think it's gonna happen.
[00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:07.940]   - Be surprised. - And I wonder if that two years
[00:49:07.940 --> 00:49:10.100]   is because of a weird outlier like the Mac Pro
[00:49:10.100 --> 00:49:12.260]   that might take a little bit longer.
[00:49:12.260 --> 00:49:14.100]   - What do they do with that? - Waiting for the second,
[00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:16.060]   the second generation of that.
[00:49:16.060 --> 00:49:18.900]   I also, yeah, sometimes I wonder if the Mac Pro
[00:49:18.900 --> 00:49:21.500]   is just gonna get a card, like an Apple Silicon card
[00:49:21.500 --> 00:49:23.580]   that you stick in it and you're like, all right, now you got--
[00:49:23.580 --> 00:49:25.660]   - You could do that, you could do that, yeah.
[00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:28.220]   - I don't know, I think the difference
[00:49:28.220 --> 00:49:33.020]   between this transition and Intel is maybe gonna be more about,
[00:49:33.020 --> 00:49:35.780]   you know, all the Intel Macs were the exact same model
[00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:38.220]   as they came before they looked exactly the same.
[00:49:38.220 --> 00:49:40.460]   All they changed, and that was at all about stability, right?
[00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:43.260]   There's like, it's all the same, it's fine, relax.
[00:49:43.260 --> 00:49:48.220]   I really feel like Apple has been holding out a lot of innovations.
[00:49:48.220 --> 00:49:51.820]   - Yes. - And so when you get that MacBook
[00:49:51.820 --> 00:49:53.820]   that gets announced or iMac or whatever
[00:49:53.820 --> 00:49:54.980]   that gets announced this fall and you're like,
[00:49:54.980 --> 00:49:56.980]   well, it's a little scary 'cause it's Apple Silicon.
[00:49:56.980 --> 00:50:00.580]   And Apple says, well, yeah, but it's got Face ID.
[00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:03.460]   And it's got a touchscreen and it has Apple Pencils support.
[00:50:03.460 --> 00:50:05.940]   - And it's got 20 hours of battery life.
[00:50:05.940 --> 00:50:07.500]   - And you're like, okay, maybe I will buy it.
[00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:10.060]   - Yeah, I'm already in line.
[00:50:10.060 --> 00:50:11.020]   I'm already in line.
[00:50:11.020 --> 00:50:12.020]   I can't wait.
[00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:15.140]   And I am not, by the way, I'm not only not buying anymore,
[00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:18.540]   Max, I'm not gonna buy any more computers.
[00:50:18.540 --> 00:50:20.820]   I think this is worth waiting for.
[00:50:20.820 --> 00:50:23.500]   I think we're seeing this is a ledge.
[00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:28.340]   We've just gone, this is something unprecedented.
[00:50:28.340 --> 00:50:29.420]   It's all gonna change.
[00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:31.180]   And I don't think it's just gonna change for Max.
[00:50:31.180 --> 00:50:32.380]   It's gonna change for Windows.
[00:50:32.380 --> 00:50:33.780]   It's gonna change for Linux.
[00:50:33.780 --> 00:50:36.860]   We are finally abandoning an antiquated architecture.
[00:50:36.860 --> 00:50:41.700]   We're moving on, I'm sorry, AMD and Intel, but that's the fact.
[00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:44.500]   And I think from the point of view of users,
[00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:46.740]   it's gonna be a good direction.
[00:50:46.740 --> 00:50:50.140]   I think the fact that Apple hadn't changed the design in years,
[00:50:50.140 --> 00:50:55.140]   which made no sense and drove us all nuts, now makes sense.
[00:50:55.140 --> 00:50:59.020]   I think they have probably some beautiful designs.
[00:50:59.020 --> 00:51:02.460]   I wouldn't be surprised at all if all the new Max
[00:51:02.460 --> 00:51:06.700]   looked completely different, the bezels disappeared,
[00:51:06.700 --> 00:51:09.620]   suddenly they got very modern, very fast,
[00:51:09.620 --> 00:51:13.340]   because that's another thing that could drive this market along.
[00:51:13.340 --> 00:51:14.180]   You agree, Laurie?
[00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:16.340]   - Like all the times we were frustrated,
[00:51:16.340 --> 00:51:20.700]   like when the most recent MacBook Pro,
[00:51:20.700 --> 00:51:24.420]   the 13 inch got updated and, oh,
[00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:26.460]   why didn't they put a better webcam in there?
[00:51:26.460 --> 00:51:29.300]   - Right. - I bet what we're gonna start seeing
[00:51:29.300 --> 00:51:32.140]   is now there's a better webcam, now there's Face ID,
[00:51:32.140 --> 00:51:34.780]   now there's Touch ID, now there's a T3 chip in your Touch ID,
[00:51:34.780 --> 00:51:37.940]   all of that, it's gonna snowball year after year after year,
[00:51:37.940 --> 00:51:40.820]   and it's not gonna be, now we're using
[00:51:40.820 --> 00:51:43.540]   another version of a lake in our processor,
[00:51:43.540 --> 00:51:45.100]   and that's all you get. - Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:51:45.100 --> 00:51:48.380]   - We're gonna see big changes. - Yeah.
[00:51:48.380 --> 00:51:52.060]   - Yeah. - I think also when you go to the high end,
[00:51:52.060 --> 00:51:54.940]   there's opportunities with ARM, you know, this week,
[00:51:54.940 --> 00:51:57.500]   another completely coincidental announcement,
[00:51:57.500 --> 00:52:01.460]   the fastest computer in the world was debuted,
[00:52:01.460 --> 00:52:03.900]   it is completely ARM powered,
[00:52:03.900 --> 00:52:08.660]   and I'm sure that Apple didn't talk to this Japanese company
[00:52:08.660 --> 00:52:11.260]   and say, "Could you just release that on W?"
[00:52:11.260 --> 00:52:16.060]   But the Fugaku developed in Kobe, Japan,
[00:52:16.060 --> 00:52:21.060]   by Fujitsu and Ryken, it uses as its chip,
[00:52:21.060 --> 00:52:26.060]   a 48 core A64FX system on a chip.
[00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:30.180]   It is 415 pedaflops,
[00:52:30.180 --> 00:52:32.700]   which is more than almost three times as fast
[00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:35.060]   as its nearest competitor.
[00:52:35.060 --> 00:52:37.380]   It's very convenient to Apple because,
[00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:39.180]   "Hey, you know what ARM isn't slow?
[00:52:39.180 --> 00:52:41.060]   What made you think ARM was slow?"
[00:52:41.060 --> 00:52:43.500]   - Yeah, I think people don't, who think of ARM
[00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:46.100]   as these kind of underpowered mobile chips,
[00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:48.060]   Mark Germans reported in April
[00:52:48.060 --> 00:52:51.740]   about what the first Mac ARM chip would be,
[00:52:51.740 --> 00:52:53.860]   he said, "It's a five nanometer process,
[00:52:53.860 --> 00:52:56.260]   so right there, that's really interesting."
[00:52:56.260 --> 00:52:59.620]   And it's 12 cores, eight performance cores,
[00:52:59.620 --> 00:53:03.420]   and four power saving cores, a 12 core.
[00:53:03.420 --> 00:53:05.220]   So imagine you're a 13 inch MacBook Pro
[00:53:05.220 --> 00:53:09.700]   with 12 cores on a five nanometer processor.
[00:53:09.700 --> 00:53:12.460]   This is not a toy chip,
[00:53:12.460 --> 00:53:14.420]   this is the real deal,
[00:53:14.420 --> 00:53:15.300]   there's a lot of potential here.
[00:53:15.300 --> 00:53:17.540]   - The other transformative thing that the iPhone brought
[00:53:17.540 --> 00:53:19.380]   was these systems on a chip,
[00:53:19.380 --> 00:53:22.100]   where because of obviously for compactness
[00:53:22.100 --> 00:53:25.580]   and price savings, you were able to put everything
[00:53:25.580 --> 00:53:27.700]   on a chip, including, by the way, the GPU.
[00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:32.060]   A GPU on die is gonna be better than any third party card
[00:53:32.060 --> 00:53:33.540]   you put in your computer,
[00:53:33.540 --> 00:53:35.820]   I don't care how fast the bus is,
[00:53:35.820 --> 00:53:39.380]   the fact that you can, because of the improved thermals
[00:53:39.380 --> 00:53:42.180]   of risk processors of ARM,
[00:53:42.180 --> 00:53:44.420]   you could make systems on a chip that are,
[00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:47.020]   well, you already are, it's called the iPad Pro,
[00:53:47.020 --> 00:53:49.300]   they're mind-boggling, the A12X.
[00:53:49.300 --> 00:53:52.740]   I think this could be revolutionary,
[00:53:52.740 --> 00:53:55.900]   your Mac Pro could have 100 cores on it.
[00:53:55.900 --> 00:53:58.660]   I just remember how mind-boggling it was
[00:53:58.660 --> 00:53:59.980]   when they announced the Apple Watch
[00:53:59.980 --> 00:54:01.500]   with the S1 chip in it, and you're like,
[00:54:01.500 --> 00:54:05.380]   they fit the entire system in a wristwatch.
[00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:07.460]   - Yeah, it just says you're pinky, yeah.
[00:54:07.460 --> 00:54:08.300]   - Yeah, exactly, yeah.
[00:54:08.300 --> 00:54:11.420]   - And you could throw 40 of those in a Mac Pro easily,
[00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:12.260]   right? - Exactly.
[00:54:12.260 --> 00:54:14.460]   - There's a potential for a lot of power there,
[00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:15.980]   especially when you can tweak things,
[00:54:15.980 --> 00:54:18.900]   and fundamentally, again, it always comes back to control,
[00:54:18.900 --> 00:54:19.740]   right?
[00:54:19.740 --> 00:54:22.420]   The stuff Apple can do when it's not bound to waiting
[00:54:22.420 --> 00:54:26.300]   for Intel to catch up on its year-long roadmap
[00:54:26.300 --> 00:54:29.100]   is going to provide them so much more flexibility
[00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:31.020]   in terms of that, the interoperability, right?
[00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:33.660]   Like the fact they don't just control the GPU
[00:54:33.660 --> 00:54:37.340]   and the processor, but also like the power management chips,
[00:54:37.340 --> 00:54:39.860]   they're gonna start building their own cellular modems, right?
[00:54:39.860 --> 00:54:41.540]   Like you start putting all these things together,
[00:54:41.540 --> 00:54:44.060]   and it's like you can get a lot out of it
[00:54:44.060 --> 00:54:46.380]   when you control every single piece of the equation.
[00:54:46.380 --> 00:54:48.420]   - Apple's battle with Qualcomm,
[00:54:48.420 --> 00:54:53.420]   which forced them to use very subpar Intel modems
[00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:56.100]   in its phones was a nightmare.
[00:54:56.100 --> 00:54:59.220]   You could just imagine the pain Apple felt
[00:54:59.220 --> 00:55:01.540]   having to build those phones,
[00:55:01.540 --> 00:55:05.580]   but the beauty of all of owning the entire stack,
[00:55:05.580 --> 00:55:08.620]   just the whole damn thing, owning the entire stack
[00:55:08.620 --> 00:55:11.420]   is there is not one transistor in there
[00:55:11.420 --> 00:55:14.060]   that isn't purpose-built to do exactly what it needs to do.
[00:55:14.060 --> 00:55:14.900]   - Yep, it is.
[00:55:14.900 --> 00:55:17.660]   - If you think about what a classic PC was,
[00:55:17.660 --> 00:55:19.860]   or at a PC maker was building out of components,
[00:55:19.860 --> 00:55:21.460]   then they-- - It was off the shelf,
[00:55:21.460 --> 00:55:22.820]   literally. - Exactly right.
[00:55:22.820 --> 00:55:25.580]   And when you talk about this being
[00:55:25.580 --> 00:55:27.820]   a real transitional moment for the computer industry,
[00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:30.020]   I think one of the things that the smartphone world
[00:55:30.020 --> 00:55:32.460]   has really pushed, and it's very clear now
[00:55:32.460 --> 00:55:33.900]   that this is what Apple thinks,
[00:55:33.900 --> 00:55:38.740]   is a computer manufacturer is not an assembler of parts.
[00:55:38.740 --> 00:55:41.820]   A computer manufacturer is a maker of a system on a chip.
[00:55:41.820 --> 00:55:44.060]   That is how Apple views themselves now.
[00:55:44.060 --> 00:55:46.540]   They put everything in there, the disk controller,
[00:55:46.540 --> 00:55:51.020]   the security, the processor, the GPU, the memory,
[00:55:51.020 --> 00:55:53.260]   it is all baked in there.
[00:55:53.260 --> 00:55:57.260]   And that is, if you don't do that,
[00:55:57.260 --> 00:55:58.300]   it's gonna be hard to compete,
[00:55:58.300 --> 00:56:00.780]   which is why I think that everybody else is taking notice.
[00:56:00.780 --> 00:56:02.260]   - I agree.
[00:56:02.260 --> 00:56:07.260]   Even when Microsoft put out its windows-on-arm surface,
[00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:12.180]   it claimed, oh, it's a custom Microsoft chip.
[00:56:12.180 --> 00:56:15.420]   That was basically a Qualcomm chip with a sidecar.
[00:56:15.420 --> 00:56:17.700]   But that's clearly the future.
[00:56:17.700 --> 00:56:19.300]   That's where you wanna go in the long run.
[00:56:19.300 --> 00:56:21.700]   I think, look, I know everybody's saying,
[00:56:21.700 --> 00:56:22.980]   you drank the Kool-Aid Leo.
[00:56:22.980 --> 00:56:24.660]   I did, I drank the Kool-Aid.
[00:56:24.660 --> 00:56:26.580]   I enjoy doing that once a year.
[00:56:26.580 --> 00:56:30.380]   But in this case, I think this is a very interesting
[00:56:30.380 --> 00:56:32.100]   transition, and I think it's transformative
[00:56:32.100 --> 00:56:33.980]   to the PC industry as a whole.
[00:56:33.980 --> 00:56:37.620]   It is a different beast than we've seen before.
[00:56:37.620 --> 00:56:41.060]   And I think it's potentially very, very powerful.
[00:56:41.060 --> 00:56:42.460]   Let's take a little break.
[00:56:42.460 --> 00:56:44.380]   There's lots more to talk about.
[00:56:44.380 --> 00:56:46.700]   If you hate Apple, this is not the show for you.
[00:56:46.700 --> 00:56:47.540]   (laughs)
[00:56:47.540 --> 00:56:49.220]   I might as well just say it.
[00:56:49.220 --> 00:56:51.340]   We will talk about some other non-Apple subjects,
[00:56:51.340 --> 00:56:52.940]   but it's pretty much about Apple.
[00:56:52.940 --> 00:56:53.940]   And then what Apple's doing,
[00:56:53.940 --> 00:56:57.220]   and how that is about to change a lot of things
[00:56:57.220 --> 00:56:58.780]   for everybody in computing.
[00:56:58.780 --> 00:57:01.260]   Laurie Gill is here from iMore.com.
[00:57:01.260 --> 00:57:02.420]   Always a pleasure to have Laurie
[00:57:02.420 --> 00:57:05.300]   a regular on our show, Mac Break Weekly.
[00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:08.820]   And from six colors, Dan Moran and Jason Snell,
[00:57:08.820 --> 00:57:11.620]   two of the best, most astute observers
[00:57:11.620 --> 00:57:15.340]   of the Apple space and prolific podcasters
[00:57:15.340 --> 00:57:17.540]   in their own right.
[00:57:17.540 --> 00:57:20.560]   Our show today brought to you by Roman.
[00:57:20.560 --> 00:57:25.860]   I have to say, being a guy, I know this.
[00:57:25.860 --> 00:57:27.660]   We don't like to go to the doctor.
[00:57:27.660 --> 00:57:28.780]   It's not like our favorite.
[00:57:28.780 --> 00:57:29.620]   Who does?
[00:57:29.620 --> 00:57:30.460]   Nobody does.
[00:57:30.460 --> 00:57:32.020]   But guys are like, we brought up.
[00:57:32.020 --> 00:57:33.620]   This is how we brought up.
[00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:35.220]   Oh, walk it off.
[00:57:35.220 --> 00:57:37.340]   You get hit by a baseball in Little League.
[00:57:37.340 --> 00:57:38.740]   No crying in baseball.
[00:57:38.740 --> 00:57:39.580]   Walk it off.
[00:57:39.580 --> 00:57:40.420]   Rub some dirt in it.
[00:57:40.420 --> 00:57:41.940]   It'll be fine.
[00:57:41.940 --> 00:57:46.140]   And that, as an adult, turns into kind of an aversion.
[00:57:46.140 --> 00:57:47.860]   I'll be, it'll be fine.
[00:57:47.860 --> 00:57:50.460]   That giant growth on my butt, that's gonna go away.
[00:57:50.460 --> 00:57:51.540]   Don't worry about it.
[00:57:51.540 --> 00:57:53.460]   It'll be fine.
[00:57:53.460 --> 00:57:55.580]   Well, guys, there's some things you really should
[00:57:55.580 --> 00:57:57.180]   probably see a doctor about.
[00:57:57.180 --> 00:57:59.060]   And Roman's here to help.
[00:57:59.060 --> 00:58:03.020]   It is a digital health clinic for men.
[00:58:03.020 --> 00:58:04.300]   They started, as you might know,
[00:58:04.300 --> 00:58:05.820]   they started with ED medication.
[00:58:05.820 --> 00:58:08.900]   And anybody who's dealt with erectile dysfunction knows,
[00:58:08.900 --> 00:58:10.940]   that is not the first thing you wanna talk about
[00:58:10.940 --> 00:58:13.020]   with anybody, not even a doctor.
[00:58:13.020 --> 00:58:16.300]   But Roman is a simple, convenient solution
[00:58:16.300 --> 00:58:19.620]   to get the treatment you need without leaving your house.
[00:58:19.620 --> 00:58:20.980]   So it started with sexual health,
[00:58:20.980 --> 00:58:23.060]   but it's so much more now.
[00:58:23.060 --> 00:58:27.460]   It really is your friend, your buddy online,
[00:58:27.460 --> 00:58:30.420]   a licensed doctor in your state.
[00:58:30.420 --> 00:58:33.060]   You, digital health for men.
[00:58:33.060 --> 00:58:36.380]   Discrete professional care, genuine prescription medication,
[00:58:36.380 --> 00:58:38.020]   but they also have over-the-counter treatments
[00:58:38.020 --> 00:58:40.820]   delivered in unmarked packaging.
[00:58:40.820 --> 00:58:42.620]   Sexual health, ED, of course.
[00:58:42.620 --> 00:58:44.660]   By the way, really good news.
[00:58:44.660 --> 00:58:49.100]   Many of these ED treatments have now become generic.
[00:58:49.100 --> 00:58:50.380]   The patents have worn off.
[00:58:50.380 --> 00:58:52.620]   The prices have dropped dramatically.
[00:58:52.620 --> 00:58:54.780]   So really now, these are medications you get
[00:58:54.780 --> 00:58:58.340]   very affordably, and it's even more affordable with Roman.
[00:58:58.340 --> 00:59:01.340]   Heron skin, dandruff, eczema, daily health,
[00:59:01.340 --> 00:59:03.100]   prostate health, bone health.
[00:59:03.100 --> 00:59:05.580]   I, they have a supplement packet I take
[00:59:05.580 --> 00:59:08.540]   that's fantastic for older guys like, like me,
[00:59:08.540 --> 00:59:10.660]   for prostate health and testosterone.
[00:59:10.660 --> 00:59:12.380]   Grab your phone, grab your computer.
[00:59:12.380 --> 00:59:14.500]   You can complete a free online visit.
[00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:15.780]   It's free.
[00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:17.700]   You'll hear back from a US licensed physician
[00:59:17.700 --> 00:59:19.820]   within 24 hours.
[00:59:19.820 --> 00:59:22.300]   It's at get Roman.com/twit.
[00:59:22.300 --> 00:59:24.180]   And if the doctor agrees the treatment's right for you,
[00:59:24.180 --> 00:59:25.620]   and by the way, that's why it's so important.
[00:59:25.620 --> 00:59:27.420]   You speak to an actual physician.
[00:59:27.420 --> 00:59:29.580]   You know, this is telemedicine.
[00:59:29.580 --> 00:59:30.420]   It's very exciting.
[00:59:30.420 --> 00:59:32.340]   It's a real transformation in how a medicine
[00:59:32.340 --> 00:59:33.820]   is delivered these days.
[00:59:33.820 --> 00:59:35.060]   But if the treatment's right for you,
[00:59:35.060 --> 00:59:37.380]   they can ship the medication direct to you.
[00:59:37.380 --> 00:59:40.100]   You'll get free two-day shipping,
[00:59:40.100 --> 00:59:42.180]   free unlimited follow-ups with your doctor,
[00:59:42.180 --> 00:59:44.860]   free unlimited anytime you have a question,
[00:59:44.860 --> 00:59:46.820]   or you want to adjust your treatment plan.
[00:59:46.820 --> 00:59:48.060]   With Roman, there's no commitment.
[00:59:48.060 --> 00:59:50.220]   You can cancel at any time.
[00:59:50.220 --> 00:59:51.940]   It's very affordable.
[00:59:51.940 --> 00:59:53.060]   It's the right way to go.
[00:59:53.060 --> 00:59:54.820]   And it's sure a lot better than rubbing dirt in it.
[00:59:54.820 --> 00:59:55.900]   Trust me.
[00:59:55.900 --> 00:59:57.940]   If you're struggling with ED, stay home
[00:59:57.940 --> 01:00:00.460]   and go to get Roman.com/twit
[01:00:00.460 --> 01:00:04.580]   for a free online visit and free two-day shipping.
[01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:09.140]   Get Roman.com/twit.
[01:00:09.140 --> 01:00:13.260]   Very, I feel like almost this is a public service announcement.
[01:00:13.260 --> 01:00:15.700]   I really feel like this is an important thing.
[01:00:15.700 --> 01:00:19.740]   I'm really glad we can talk about it amongst friends.
[01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:22.020]   Get Roman.com/twit.
[01:00:22.020 --> 01:00:23.100]   You don't have to suffer.
[01:00:23.100 --> 01:00:23.940]   Get Roman.
[01:00:23.940 --> 01:00:29.140]   I would love to talk about other stuff too,
[01:00:29.140 --> 01:00:32.340]   but there were so many announcements at WWDC.
[01:00:32.340 --> 01:00:34.340]   I feel like we, and we got the team to do it.
[01:00:34.340 --> 01:00:37.580]   We've got to run them down.
[01:00:37.580 --> 01:00:39.540]   It is now Mac OS 11, right?
[01:00:39.540 --> 01:00:43.380]   They're not going to-- 10 is dead, right?
[01:00:43.380 --> 01:00:45.380]   Yeah, they removed the branding two years ago,
[01:00:45.380 --> 01:00:50.020]   and now it's officially 11.0 if you check the about box.
[01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:53.260]   Only took 19 years or so was that.
[01:00:53.260 --> 01:00:56.500]   And 11 makes a lot of sense, although they're at iOS 14.
[01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:57.700]   Maybe they should have made it fourth.
[01:00:57.700 --> 01:00:59.540]   I don't know.
[01:00:59.540 --> 01:01:00.700]   11 is fine.
[01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:02.340]   I think I spoke about this before.
[01:01:02.340 --> 01:01:10.420]   I think the thing is, if you go from iOS 10 and Mac OS 10,
[01:01:10.420 --> 01:01:13.580]   OS 10 point, all of the different 10 versions
[01:01:13.580 --> 01:01:16.020]   of what Mac has been for this whole time,
[01:01:16.020 --> 01:01:20.100]   if you just jumped to 14, you're really just saying,
[01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:21.580]   we're just changing the number.
[01:01:21.580 --> 01:01:22.700]   We're just catching up.
[01:01:22.700 --> 01:01:23.940]   But if you go--
[01:01:23.940 --> 01:01:27.140]   if you say, I'm going to 11, what you're saying
[01:01:27.140 --> 01:01:31.180]   is this is a brand new completely redesigned operating
[01:01:31.180 --> 01:01:31.540]   system.
[01:01:31.540 --> 01:01:33.500]   So I think for the marketing perspective,
[01:01:33.500 --> 01:01:36.020]   it made a lot of sense that they went to 11,
[01:01:36.020 --> 01:01:38.140]   because what they're saying is, we're not just
[01:01:38.140 --> 01:01:40.100]   catching up with the other naming schemes.
[01:01:40.100 --> 01:01:43.620]   What we're doing is proving to you in this wording,
[01:01:43.620 --> 01:01:45.860]   what a big deal it is that we're changing
[01:01:45.860 --> 01:01:47.340]   this operating system.
[01:01:47.340 --> 01:01:49.180]   It also eliminates any thought that, oh, they're
[01:01:49.180 --> 01:01:51.140]   turning it into iOS.
[01:01:51.140 --> 01:01:51.900]   That too.
[01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:52.860]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:01:52.860 --> 01:01:53.820]   Yeah, that would be--
[01:01:53.820 --> 01:01:55.660]   Yeah, I think Craig Federighi said on the talk
[01:01:55.660 --> 01:01:56.900]   that was a little--
[01:01:56.900 --> 01:01:57.460]   Go ahead, it did.
[01:01:57.460 --> 01:02:00.300]   --the same thing, which is--
[01:02:00.300 --> 01:02:03.620]   sometimes people say, oh, well, this is too much thought.
[01:02:03.620 --> 01:02:06.540]   It's just a version of-- and Craig Federighi said it.
[01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:07.820]   They talked a lot--
[01:02:07.820 --> 01:02:09.060]   They think about it all.
[01:02:09.060 --> 01:02:11.660]   --about what to call this and how to execute
[01:02:11.660 --> 01:02:14.380]   changing it from Mac OS 10 to Mac OS.
[01:02:14.380 --> 01:02:18.060]   And then-- and what number was it going to be?
[01:02:18.060 --> 01:02:19.460]   And I think Lori is exactly right,
[01:02:19.460 --> 01:02:22.740]   that calling it Mac OS 14, although it would be in lockstep
[01:02:22.740 --> 01:02:26.860]   with iOS and iPad OS and TVOS, it would be the wrong message.
[01:02:26.860 --> 01:02:30.140]   It would be, yes, it's just another adjunct to the iPad.
[01:02:30.140 --> 01:02:31.140]   And they didn't want to do that.
[01:02:31.140 --> 01:02:31.640]   Yeah.
[01:02:31.640 --> 01:02:33.340]   And if you're going to change it after 20 years, yeah.
[01:02:33.340 --> 01:02:35.300]   I mean, clearly, you want to put some thought into it.
[01:02:35.300 --> 01:02:37.580]   And you don't want to have to deal with the--
[01:02:37.580 --> 01:02:42.020]   getting even the-- when Windows skipped to 10, right?
[01:02:42.020 --> 01:02:44.060]   And everyone's like, what happened to Windows 9?
[01:02:44.060 --> 01:02:46.980]   And everyone's like, well, let's just not talk about it.
[01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:48.460]   I think that was--
[01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:50.020]   it's not the biggest deal in the world.
[01:02:50.020 --> 01:02:53.340]   But I think Lori is totally right that it's all about showing
[01:02:53.340 --> 01:02:56.660]   respect for what came before, as well as--
[01:02:56.660 --> 01:02:59.620]   it kind of harkens back to what Jason said about the Intel
[01:02:59.620 --> 01:03:02.460]   Macs looking the same as the Macs that came before it,
[01:03:02.460 --> 01:03:05.020]   is like it's a certain amount of stability, especially
[01:03:05.020 --> 01:03:07.420]   when so much else is changing in the release.
[01:03:07.420 --> 01:03:09.220]   It's like, don't worry, we're just going one number.
[01:03:09.220 --> 01:03:11.260]   Like, we're sticking with the version numbering that you know,
[01:03:11.260 --> 01:03:13.740]   we're just going to increment by one instead of by four.
[01:03:13.740 --> 01:03:15.540]   Yeah.
[01:03:15.540 --> 01:03:17.620]   Also, all the spinal tap references we get to--
[01:03:17.620 --> 01:03:18.120]   Yeah.
[01:03:18.120 --> 01:03:19.700]   Man, I bet you that was--
[01:03:19.700 --> 01:03:21.980]   I bet you that was a negative.
[01:03:21.980 --> 01:03:23.420]   Not a positive.
[01:03:23.420 --> 01:03:25.140]   Maybe, I don't know.
[01:03:25.140 --> 01:03:28.500]   Craig's made all those jokes about taking an asset
[01:03:28.500 --> 01:03:30.740]   or something in the--
[01:03:30.740 --> 01:03:31.260]   Yeah.
[01:03:31.260 --> 01:03:32.260]   That's so weird.
[01:03:32.260 --> 01:03:34.300]   Oh, what a weird crack marketing team.
[01:03:34.300 --> 01:03:36.180]   Yeah, the crack marketing.
[01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:36.940]   That's so weird.
[01:03:36.940 --> 01:03:40.860]   That's got-- you know what?
[01:03:40.860 --> 01:03:41.340]   It's nice.
[01:03:41.340 --> 01:03:45.260]   By the way, is this a good format for WWDC?
[01:03:45.260 --> 01:03:48.580]   Should they do this from now on?
[01:03:48.580 --> 01:03:50.140]   It's some of the stuff's great.
[01:03:50.140 --> 01:03:51.100]   Some of the stuff is great.
[01:03:51.100 --> 01:03:53.420]   I think having the access afforded
[01:03:53.420 --> 01:03:55.940]   by having the videos immediately available,
[01:03:55.940 --> 01:03:59.140]   not having to essentially pack people in a room.
[01:03:59.140 --> 01:04:01.700]   And as Jason and I can tell you, having watched a bunch of these,
[01:04:01.700 --> 01:04:05.180]   like making these sessions exactly as long as they
[01:04:05.180 --> 01:04:07.740]   need to be, instead of having to fill a time block,
[01:04:07.740 --> 01:04:09.460]   and having as many of them as you want,
[01:04:09.460 --> 01:04:12.020]   instead of having to worry about how many rooms do we have,
[01:04:12.020 --> 01:04:15.540]   like avoiding all of that logistical stuff,
[01:04:15.540 --> 01:04:19.060]   I think really helps them deliver talks that are much more
[01:04:19.060 --> 01:04:19.820]   useful.
[01:04:19.820 --> 01:04:21.860]   But obviously, you do lose a huge amount
[01:04:21.860 --> 01:04:23.820]   of the social aspect, which is really
[01:04:23.820 --> 01:04:26.980]   sad to see, because we all liked going and seeing friends.
[01:04:26.980 --> 01:04:28.420]   And even if you didn't go to the conference,
[01:04:28.420 --> 01:04:30.900]   you would maybe go and hang out.
[01:04:30.900 --> 01:04:33.020]   And it's a great opportunity to meet new people
[01:04:33.020 --> 01:04:34.060]   who are in the same business.
[01:04:34.060 --> 01:04:35.700]   So I think there's some downsides to it.
[01:04:35.700 --> 01:04:38.500]   But I think from an information delivery standpoint,
[01:04:38.500 --> 01:04:41.220]   it's hard to argue that it's not superior to packing yourself
[01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:44.340]   in a small conference room, especially right now.
[01:04:44.340 --> 01:04:46.260]   I wouldn't mind seeing them do this forever.
[01:04:46.260 --> 01:04:47.820]   And I'll tell you what I love about it
[01:04:47.820 --> 01:04:51.940]   is it's inclusive, not exclusive.
[01:04:51.940 --> 01:04:54.260]   I can't-- first of all, as a journalist,
[01:04:54.260 --> 01:04:57.700]   I was always thrown out after the keynote at WWDC.
[01:04:57.700 --> 01:04:59.340]   I want to see the tracks.
[01:04:59.340 --> 01:05:00.500]   I want to see them all.
[01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:03.140]   There's lots of people who can't afford to fly to San Jose,
[01:05:03.140 --> 01:05:04.900]   can't afford the ticket.
[01:05:04.900 --> 01:05:06.620]   The tickets are in short supply anyway.
[01:05:06.620 --> 01:05:09.700]   Not everybody can buy one, even if they have the wherewithal.
[01:05:09.700 --> 01:05:12.620]   I think it's-- why wouldn't you want to make a developer
[01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:14.100]   conference available to all?
[01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:16.740]   Sure, you missed the face to face.
[01:05:16.740 --> 01:05:19.900]   John Groobers got a Zoom, Craig Federighi and Jaws,
[01:05:19.900 --> 01:05:22.100]   instead of sitting on a stage.
[01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:23.020]   Big deal.
[01:05:23.020 --> 01:05:26.580]   I don't think the face to face is as valuable as it used to be.
[01:05:26.580 --> 01:05:28.740]   I like having you sitting next to me, Jason,
[01:05:28.740 --> 01:05:30.500]   when you can come up to do Twitch.
[01:05:30.500 --> 01:05:32.020]   But we're getting a show done.
[01:05:32.020 --> 01:05:33.100]   It works.
[01:05:33.100 --> 01:05:34.420]   Yeah, it works.
[01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:36.940]   Yeah, I think it's been free for everybody
[01:05:36.940 --> 01:05:38.140]   the last few years.
[01:05:38.140 --> 01:05:38.980]   And it's been about--
[01:05:38.980 --> 01:05:39.980]   Oh, it has.
[01:05:39.980 --> 01:05:41.300]   You've been able to watch it, but it's still
[01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:45.100]   been in the conference center in these time blocks,
[01:05:45.100 --> 01:05:46.900]   50-minute slots and stuff like that.
[01:05:46.900 --> 01:05:48.540]   And they have been freed from that.
[01:05:48.540 --> 01:05:52.740]   And as an education for developers,
[01:05:52.740 --> 01:05:55.100]   which is really what it's supposed to be,
[01:05:55.100 --> 01:05:57.980]   it is vastly superior this way.
[01:05:57.980 --> 01:05:58.900]   I'm curious.
[01:05:58.900 --> 01:06:01.420]   They're trying online like labs where you sign up
[01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:03.940]   for office hours to talk to Apple engineers.
[01:06:03.940 --> 01:06:06.140]   I'm going to be interested to see those people who went
[01:06:06.140 --> 01:06:06.780]   through that.
[01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:07.540]   How that works.
[01:06:07.540 --> 01:06:08.620]   Yeah, I wonder what that was like.
[01:06:08.620 --> 01:06:09.340]   Because that is important.
[01:06:09.340 --> 01:06:09.860]   That is important.
[01:06:09.860 --> 01:06:10.300]   That is important.
[01:06:10.300 --> 01:06:11.300]   That is important.
[01:06:11.300 --> 01:06:11.660]   That face to face.
[01:06:11.660 --> 01:06:13.540]   There are sessions, but they're all on video.
[01:06:13.540 --> 01:06:17.380]   But I can go into a lab and I can see the engineer who
[01:06:17.380 --> 01:06:19.820]   is working on the thing that my app relies on.
[01:06:19.820 --> 01:06:21.820]   And I can say, why doesn't this work?
[01:06:21.820 --> 01:06:23.460]   And they can give me an explanation.
[01:06:23.460 --> 01:06:24.340]   That's super valuable.
[01:06:24.340 --> 01:06:26.900]   And if they can't replicate that well online,
[01:06:26.900 --> 01:06:29.020]   then that would be a reason to do it.
[01:06:29.020 --> 01:06:30.700]   But in terms of the sessions, these sessions
[01:06:30.700 --> 01:06:33.260]   are the best WWDC sessions ever.
[01:06:33.260 --> 01:06:36.100]   And if what they want to do is educate developers,
[01:06:36.100 --> 01:06:37.260]   they should do it like this every year.
[01:06:37.260 --> 01:06:38.420]   You bet.
[01:06:38.420 --> 01:06:40.860]   I think Microsoft's going to do that.
[01:06:40.860 --> 01:06:42.780]   I think their build conference was fantastic.
[01:06:42.780 --> 01:06:44.460]   I think that Apple should do it.
[01:06:44.460 --> 01:06:45.660]   I wonder what Google's going to do.
[01:06:45.660 --> 01:06:47.260]   They deferred at Google I/O.
[01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:49.580]   But I think they're probably watching this going, yeah,
[01:06:49.580 --> 01:06:51.180]   this isn't a bad way to go.
[01:06:51.180 --> 01:06:53.860]   After all, you want as many people as possible to develop,
[01:06:53.860 --> 01:06:57.220]   especially now, you want to get everybody sitting down
[01:06:57.220 --> 01:06:58.980]   and doing this.
[01:06:58.980 --> 01:07:01.220]   They've been giving away Xcode forever.
[01:07:01.220 --> 01:07:03.860]   That's just more of the same.
[01:07:03.860 --> 01:07:04.260]   So good.
[01:07:04.260 --> 01:07:06.180]   I think there's really something to be said
[01:07:06.180 --> 01:07:08.780]   for the in-person part of it, though.
[01:07:08.780 --> 01:07:12.540]   So the shaking hands with people that you know and networking
[01:07:12.540 --> 01:07:15.820]   and things like that, it's more valuable than you might think.
[01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:20.140]   You learn about new processes that other people are doing,
[01:07:20.140 --> 01:07:23.260]   not just an Apple engineer to a developer,
[01:07:23.260 --> 01:07:25.380]   but developers to each other.
[01:07:25.380 --> 01:07:27.660]   There's things like all conflict, other conferences
[01:07:27.660 --> 01:07:29.540]   that take place around the same time,
[01:07:29.540 --> 01:07:33.380]   where you again learn about new things, new technologies,
[01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:36.620]   new things that are going on, startups that are happening.
[01:07:36.620 --> 01:07:40.820]   I think that it should continue as an in-person event.
[01:07:40.820 --> 01:07:45.420]   So I like the idea of maybe a hybrid version,
[01:07:45.420 --> 01:07:49.220]   just like the two of you are saying about the quality
[01:07:49.220 --> 01:07:51.700]   of each one of these sessions and the ability
[01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:53.580]   to time it out to whatever it needed to be,
[01:07:53.580 --> 01:07:55.660]   I think that is very important.
[01:07:55.660 --> 01:08:00.420]   But I don't think that Apple should just completely
[01:08:00.420 --> 01:08:02.740]   be online for the future, because I really
[01:08:02.740 --> 01:08:04.500]   do think that there's a lot of things
[01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:07.380]   that developers missed out on by not being in attendance.
[01:08:07.380 --> 01:08:12.340]   And maybe that's why people go might shift and change
[01:08:12.340 --> 01:08:14.820]   a little, but that would still allow for that to continue.
[01:08:15.700 --> 01:08:17.980]   I'm not a designer.
[01:08:17.980 --> 01:08:22.020]   So an Apple made it like the new designer,
[01:08:22.020 --> 01:08:24.660]   big service, really big deal.
[01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:29.220]   And to me, I just like, okay, whatever.
[01:08:29.220 --> 01:08:32.340]   But maybe you guys have an aesthetic that I lack.
[01:08:32.340 --> 01:08:35.100]   Is there much to say about?
[01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:37.460]   I have to say it's weird that the control panel,
[01:08:37.460 --> 01:08:40.100]   they've got the control panel on Mac OS.
[01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:42.540]   There's two things that I think are important here.
[01:08:42.540 --> 01:08:46.300]   One is I think a lot of this is about reducing friction
[01:08:46.300 --> 01:08:49.820]   between people moving back and forth between iOS, iPad,
[01:08:49.820 --> 01:08:50.660]   and Mac.
[01:08:50.660 --> 01:08:51.900]   It's kind of starts to look the same.
[01:08:51.900 --> 01:08:54.100]   Like Jason said earlier, like the stuff you're seeing
[01:08:54.100 --> 01:08:57.540]   in the iPad now with the side bars and the drop down menus,
[01:08:57.540 --> 01:08:59.660]   it lets them move everything forward,
[01:08:59.660 --> 01:09:02.420]   but kind of bring things into alignment a little bit more.
[01:09:02.420 --> 01:09:05.620]   So if you jump back and forth between your iPad and your Mac,
[01:09:05.620 --> 01:09:07.740]   you're not going to experience quite as much like,
[01:09:07.740 --> 01:09:08.620]   oh, where is that thing?
[01:09:08.620 --> 01:09:10.820]   Or how do I do this thing that I can do over here,
[01:09:10.820 --> 01:09:12.140]   but now on this device.
[01:09:12.140 --> 01:09:14.620]   And if you're now, as we discussed in the first part of the show,
[01:09:14.620 --> 01:09:18.500]   if you're running iPad OS apps and iPhone apps on your Mac,
[01:09:18.500 --> 01:09:20.300]   it reduces some of the potential friction
[01:09:20.300 --> 01:09:21.500]   for design differences there.
[01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:23.580]   Those perhaps don't stand out as much.
[01:09:23.580 --> 01:09:26.540]   They don't look as alien if the interfaces are kind
[01:09:26.540 --> 01:09:29.140]   of converging towards the same point.
[01:09:29.140 --> 01:09:32.540]   And as we also discussed, moving the elements
[01:09:32.540 --> 01:09:34.860]   and changing them in such a way that they maybe are
[01:09:34.860 --> 01:09:37.900]   a little bit more iPad-like could open the door
[01:09:37.900 --> 01:09:40.660]   for a touchscreen option on the Mac.
[01:09:40.660 --> 01:09:41.660]   I have to--
[01:09:41.660 --> 01:09:43.700]   I have to say, looking at this, I have to say,
[01:09:43.700 --> 01:09:45.740]   I agree with you more than I did at first,
[01:09:45.740 --> 01:09:48.100]   because all the touch targets are big.
[01:09:48.100 --> 01:09:49.860]   This is just really--
[01:09:49.860 --> 01:09:51.020]   The menu bar is bigger.
[01:09:51.020 --> 01:09:54.100]   All of the individual menu items are taller.
[01:09:54.100 --> 01:09:55.980]   All the app icons, because you're
[01:09:55.980 --> 01:10:00.140]   going to be able to run on Apple Silicon Macs, iOS and iPad
[01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:02.940]   apps, they made all the Mac apps also
[01:10:02.940 --> 01:10:04.700]   have the little round rec icon thing
[01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:06.380]   so that all the icons kind of look alike.
[01:10:06.380 --> 01:10:08.500]   They could have made them like, no, Mac icons
[01:10:08.500 --> 01:10:09.460]   don't have round recs.
[01:10:09.460 --> 01:10:10.380]   They didn't do that, right?
[01:10:10.380 --> 01:10:12.020]   They're like, their apps.
[01:10:12.020 --> 01:10:14.300]   All apps are shaped the same way, right?
[01:10:14.300 --> 01:10:15.900]   So I think that--
[01:10:15.900 --> 01:10:17.180]   I think it totally--
[01:10:17.180 --> 01:10:20.660]   I looked at the Big Sur design and I thought, oh, maybe they
[01:10:20.660 --> 01:10:22.420]   really are going to make touchscreen Macs.
[01:10:22.420 --> 01:10:25.380]   And then knowing that they're going to run iPad and iOS
[01:10:25.380 --> 01:10:29.460]   apps as well just kind of doubly makes me think that.
[01:10:29.460 --> 01:10:31.460]   Yeah, the control panel, for instance, which they're
[01:10:31.460 --> 01:10:35.700]   taking directly from iOS, is not a mouse affordance.
[01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:37.940]   That's a finger thing.
[01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:39.900]   I mean, they added some nice Mac stuff to it.
[01:10:39.900 --> 01:10:41.260]   Like, you're going to be able to drag things out
[01:10:41.260 --> 01:10:43.020]   and put them in the menu bar, which is a concept that
[01:10:43.020 --> 01:10:45.260]   doesn't exist, except on the Mac, the idea of a menu bar.
[01:10:45.260 --> 01:10:47.140]   But yeah, control center.
[01:10:47.140 --> 01:10:49.380]   It's a nice interface and it's familiar.
[01:10:49.380 --> 01:10:51.820]   I think the argument would be, is that about a accommodating
[01:10:51.820 --> 01:10:54.300]   touch or is that, as Dan said, about accommodating people
[01:10:54.300 --> 01:10:58.420]   who are used to the concepts in iPad and iPhone?
[01:10:58.420 --> 01:10:59.740]   Yeah, but look at that slider.
[01:10:59.740 --> 01:11:02.700]   That's just my finger.
[01:11:02.700 --> 01:11:04.220]   I mean, that's huge.
[01:11:04.220 --> 01:11:06.780]   That's huge, that slider.
[01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:08.980]   It seems to me that's what they're going for.
[01:11:08.980 --> 01:11:11.500]   That's really going to be an interesting thing.
[01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:15.940]   There's also some design changes in iPad and iPhone
[01:11:15.940 --> 01:11:19.460]   that allow things for drop down contextual menus that I think
[01:11:19.460 --> 01:11:24.340]   is all doing that, bringing them together on all sides,
[01:11:24.340 --> 01:11:28.700]   not just making Mac look more like iPad and iPhone,
[01:11:28.700 --> 01:11:32.540]   but also making iPad and iPhone act more like Mac,
[01:11:32.540 --> 01:11:35.740]   so that across the board, we're just more familiar with it.
[01:11:35.740 --> 01:11:38.740]   Instead of saying, how do I find that menu?
[01:11:38.740 --> 01:11:40.500]   Where is it? How do I get to it?
[01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:43.620]   We know how to do it on all three devices,
[01:11:43.620 --> 01:11:47.860]   and that just makes it a more better flowing experience for us.
[01:11:47.860 --> 01:11:51.260]   Messages was a big difference too.
[01:11:51.260 --> 01:11:54.900]   I'm an idiot, but I was sitting there going in Android,
[01:11:54.900 --> 01:11:56.660]   in Android, in Android, but no, of course,
[01:11:56.660 --> 01:11:59.900]   they're never going to do messages for Android.
[01:11:59.900 --> 01:12:03.380]   This is the ultimate ecosystem lock-in.
[01:12:03.380 --> 01:12:06.380]   But I have to say that the group--
[01:12:06.380 --> 01:12:08.060]   I don't use the group messages a lot,
[01:12:08.060 --> 01:12:09.500]   but it looked like those were a lot of--
[01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:11.460]   for people who do, those features
[01:12:11.460 --> 01:12:14.780]   are going to be very, very powerful.
[01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:16.300]   In line with the device.
[01:12:16.300 --> 01:12:18.460]   Lessons learned from other chat apps
[01:12:18.460 --> 01:12:20.100]   that messages really needed to do.
[01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:22.580]   All of us have been punished by a group chat and messages
[01:12:22.580 --> 01:12:24.980]   at one point or another, and being able to.
[01:12:24.980 --> 01:12:27.340]   The mentions thing, where you can turn off all notifications,
[01:12:27.340 --> 01:12:29.780]   but if somebody says your name, you get notified,
[01:12:29.780 --> 01:12:30.860]   that's a winner.
[01:12:30.860 --> 01:12:31.460]   I like that.
[01:12:31.460 --> 01:12:32.460]   Love that.
[01:12:32.460 --> 01:12:34.780]   That's making it more like slice.
[01:12:34.780 --> 01:12:35.260]   Yep.
[01:12:35.260 --> 01:12:35.760]   Yes.
[01:12:35.760 --> 01:12:38.080]   Threads and mentions and all that stuff.
[01:12:38.080 --> 01:12:40.400]   I've already upgraded on at least one of my devices,
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:42.360]   and I have a couple of regular group chats.
[01:12:42.360 --> 01:12:43.680]   And I'm putting replies in.
[01:12:43.680 --> 01:12:46.000]   I was like, oh, you guys can't see any of this.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:49.560]   I can't believe I have to wait for you to upgrade your devices.
[01:12:49.560 --> 01:12:53.080]   Yeah, we should start a group chat so we can just do that.
[01:12:53.080 --> 01:12:53.640]   That's right.
[01:12:53.640 --> 01:12:54.440]   Yeah.
[01:12:54.440 --> 01:12:56.640]   We should say that messages on the Mac is catalyst.
[01:12:56.640 --> 01:12:58.040]   And this is a good example of why
[01:12:58.040 --> 01:12:59.960]   catalyst got a bad reputation, because of some
[01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:02.760]   of Apple's tentative steps with catalyst on the Mac.
[01:13:02.760 --> 01:13:05.040]   We're kind of not very good.
[01:13:05.040 --> 01:13:09.440]   But I've used the messages in Big Sur a little bit.
[01:13:09.440 --> 01:13:13.280]   And messages is an app that kind of Apple
[01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:14.520]   left by the wayside on the Mac.
[01:13:14.520 --> 01:13:16.200]   And it missed a lot of the features.
[01:13:16.200 --> 01:13:19.480]   Messages on Big Sur, it's pretty good.
[01:13:19.480 --> 01:13:20.200]   It's pretty good.
[01:13:20.200 --> 01:13:22.280]   It doesn't feel super weird.
[01:13:22.280 --> 01:13:25.640]   And old messages was actually really kind of bad.
[01:13:25.640 --> 01:13:28.520]   So I think that that and the Maps app as well, which
[01:13:28.520 --> 01:13:30.280]   they brought over using catalyst, I
[01:13:30.280 --> 01:13:32.400]   think they feel good, which makes me feel better about Mac
[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:36.360]   catalyst again, because good app experiences under catalyst
[01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:39.280]   is a good sign for the future.
[01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:41.080]   Somebody's bringing this up in the chat.
[01:13:41.080 --> 01:13:43.200]   And I didn't mention it when we were talking about hardware.
[01:13:43.200 --> 01:13:48.040]   But I wonder what happens to Thunderbolt on Apple's side.
[01:13:48.040 --> 01:13:49.680]   I have an answer for that.
[01:13:49.680 --> 01:13:52.440]   So USB 4 is Thunderbolt 4.
[01:13:52.440 --> 01:13:53.760]   Basically, they're the same.
[01:13:53.760 --> 01:13:56.000]   There's just one spec with one connector,
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.560]   the standard USB-C connector.
[01:13:58.560 --> 01:14:00.960]   And my understanding, the reports I've read
[01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:03.040]   say that that's due this fall.
[01:14:03.040 --> 01:14:06.040]   I would not be surprised if Apple's first Apple Silicon
[01:14:06.040 --> 01:14:08.040]   Macs were USB 4 Macs.
[01:14:08.040 --> 01:14:09.040]   No, it was underbolt.
[01:14:09.040 --> 01:14:10.040]   USB 4.
[01:14:10.040 --> 01:14:12.440]   And they built their own USB 4/Thunderbolt ports
[01:14:12.440 --> 01:14:14.600]   that would be compatible, backward compatible,
[01:14:14.600 --> 01:14:17.960]   with all existing Thunderbolt and USB-C stuff.
[01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:20.240]   It would not surprise me at all if that's the story here,
[01:14:20.240 --> 01:14:23.280]   that they didn't bother building Thunderbolt 3 stuff,
[01:14:23.280 --> 01:14:25.280]   because they could use the Intel chipsets for that.
[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:29.480]   But they did engineer the new stuff to work with this stuff.
[01:14:29.480 --> 01:14:30.880]   So that's my hope.
[01:14:30.880 --> 01:14:33.920]   I hope we don't end up with an interim generation that's
[01:14:33.920 --> 01:14:35.440]   sort of just USB only.
[01:14:35.440 --> 01:14:36.800]   That would be not as good.
[01:14:36.800 --> 01:14:40.240]   No, that's exactly what I was thinking.
[01:14:40.240 --> 01:14:43.000]   This is the perfect opportunity to move to USB 4,
[01:14:43.000 --> 01:14:44.680]   with very little downside.
[01:14:44.680 --> 01:14:47.080]   Your Thunderbolt 3 stuff will still work.
[01:14:47.080 --> 01:14:49.560]   Your multi-display systems will still work.
[01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:50.080]   Exactly.
[01:14:50.080 --> 01:14:52.040]   And you get the same 40 gigabit per second
[01:14:52.040 --> 01:14:53.800]   throughput on USB 4.
[01:14:53.800 --> 01:14:54.800]   So there's really--
[01:14:54.800 --> 01:14:57.600]   Yeah, even though Thunderbolt is an Intel-owned thing,
[01:14:57.600 --> 01:14:59.360]   it's licensed and Apple has a license,
[01:14:59.360 --> 01:15:01.360]   and it's not a big deal.
[01:15:01.360 --> 01:15:02.680]   It is a standard.
[01:15:02.680 --> 01:15:06.360]   I think the licensing for Thunderbolt or USB 4
[01:15:06.360 --> 01:15:09.440]   is completely open because it's a USB- adopted standard.
[01:15:09.440 --> 01:15:11.240]   So it's kind of not an issue.
[01:15:11.240 --> 01:15:13.160]   Apple will just write their own controller
[01:15:13.160 --> 01:15:15.560]   and won't be relying on Intel to do it.
[01:15:15.560 --> 01:15:18.520]   It opens up possibilities on the iPad side as well.
[01:15:18.520 --> 01:15:21.920]   If you've already got a USB-C on your iPad Pros,
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:24.120]   that could move to USB 4 in the future.
[01:15:24.120 --> 01:15:26.640]   So that would be a huge benefit for those devices too.
[01:15:26.640 --> 01:15:27.080]   Yeah.
[01:15:27.080 --> 01:15:29.160]   I feel like that's also part of the future.
[01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:31.160]   And actually a very big part.
[01:15:31.160 --> 01:15:33.280]   Ultimately, connectivity is important.
[01:15:33.280 --> 01:15:35.600]   And I would like to see that.
[01:15:35.600 --> 01:15:35.960]   So good.
[01:15:35.960 --> 01:15:37.160]   All right.
[01:15:37.160 --> 01:15:39.600]   USB 4 timing, perfect.
[01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:40.520]   So what do you think?
[01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:46.040]   September, MacBook 13-inch, MacBook Pro, USB 4.
[01:15:46.040 --> 01:15:48.560]   Mac OS has lagged a little bit, and I wonder
[01:15:48.560 --> 01:15:51.160]   if it'll be October, where they'll try to--
[01:15:51.160 --> 01:15:51.960]   coronavirus, right?
[01:15:51.960 --> 01:15:53.640]   We don't actually know because of COVID-19,
[01:15:53.640 --> 01:15:55.280]   exactly when everything's going to ship.
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:15:56.960]   If I had to put money down, I'd say it probably more
[01:15:56.960 --> 01:16:00.400]   like October that they'll try to get an iPhone out in September
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:02.080]   and then the Macs will follow in October.
[01:16:02.080 --> 01:16:06.080]   But this fall, I think when Big Sur ships,
[01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:09.360]   Apple will be ready to sell at least a little bit
[01:16:09.360 --> 01:16:10.720]   of Apple Silicon Macs.
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:11.920]   But they need Big Sur for it.
[01:16:11.920 --> 01:16:12.960]   Wow.
[01:16:12.960 --> 01:16:15.120]   So I'm going to just be--
[01:16:15.120 --> 01:16:17.840]   I'm going to be the opposite of that just because I can.
[01:16:17.840 --> 01:16:19.840]   Because I honestly don't know for sure.
[01:16:19.840 --> 01:16:21.680]   And here's going to be what I predict.
[01:16:21.680 --> 01:16:24.640]   I'm going to predict that we're going to get another Intel
[01:16:24.640 --> 01:16:27.200]   Mac in the fall with Big Sur.
[01:16:27.200 --> 01:16:32.800]   But they're going to have the Apple Silicon Mac, whatever
[01:16:32.800 --> 01:16:36.320]   that is, that'll be ready before Christmas.
[01:16:36.320 --> 01:16:40.480]   And I think it's going to be an iMac and a MacBook.
[01:16:40.480 --> 01:16:42.000]   That's those armwins.
[01:16:42.000 --> 01:16:45.440]   But we're going to get an Intel Mac.
[01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:45.920]   What?
[01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:48.160]   They did say we have Intel Macs in the pipeline.
[01:16:48.160 --> 01:16:49.520]   He said they have more in the pipeline, yeah.
[01:16:49.520 --> 01:16:50.640]   What is that going to be?
[01:16:50.640 --> 01:16:51.440]   I don't want that.
[01:16:51.440 --> 01:16:53.040]   I mean, knowing Apple--
[01:16:53.040 --> 01:16:55.680]   When Apple says they'll lose something by the end of the year,
[01:16:55.680 --> 01:16:57.680]   it oftentimes means December.
[01:16:57.680 --> 01:16:58.040]   Right.
[01:16:58.040 --> 01:17:00.800]   Because they like to really stretch those things out.
[01:17:00.800 --> 01:17:03.360]   So yeah, right before Christmas or right after--
[01:17:03.360 --> 01:17:05.200]   I mean, the Pro, I think that was a Mac Pro.
[01:17:05.200 --> 01:17:05.840]   That was a thing.
[01:17:05.840 --> 01:17:07.920]   So yeah, I'm with Laurie that I think
[01:17:07.920 --> 01:17:10.560]   that there's a MacBook and an iMac are both likely.
[01:17:10.560 --> 01:17:11.520]   Because I think they're going to want
[01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:14.800]   to show the capability not only of the laptop form factor,
[01:17:14.800 --> 01:17:15.760]   but of the desktop.
[01:17:15.760 --> 01:17:17.760]   Like, because that's going to be the big question, right?
[01:17:17.760 --> 01:17:20.320]   A laptop is something that fundamentally--
[01:17:20.320 --> 01:17:21.760]   it's kind of iPad-like, right?
[01:17:21.760 --> 01:17:22.640]   It's not an iPad.
[01:17:22.640 --> 01:17:25.200]   But it's kind of iPad-like, whereas they have never
[01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:26.720]   made a desktop with their own silicon.
[01:17:26.720 --> 01:17:28.400]   That is going to feel very different.
[01:17:28.400 --> 01:17:30.160]   And I think they really want to put--
[01:17:30.160 --> 01:17:32.080]   Kyle, like Jason said before in terms of,
[01:17:32.080 --> 01:17:34.240]   this is your opportunity to make a statement.
[01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:36.480]   I think they want to come out loud and strong and say,
[01:17:36.480 --> 01:17:39.360]   here is our desktop flagship running arm.
[01:17:39.360 --> 01:17:42.960]   So I think that's quite possible.
[01:17:42.960 --> 01:17:44.000]   I'm saving my pennies.
[01:17:44.000 --> 01:17:46.400]   That's all I can say.
[01:17:46.400 --> 01:17:49.600]   You're going to get one of each, whatever it is.
[01:17:49.600 --> 01:17:51.280]   No problem, absolutely.
[01:17:51.280 --> 01:17:54.320]   And I know there's a big risk being buying the first one.
[01:17:54.320 --> 01:17:56.000]   But I don't think it's as big as it could be.
[01:17:56.000 --> 01:18:00.400]   A worst-case scenario, it's an iPad Pro in a box.
[01:18:00.400 --> 01:18:00.880]   Right?
[01:18:00.880 --> 01:18:01.920]   That's the worst case.
[01:18:01.920 --> 01:18:03.520]   That's what they're selling-- they're not selling
[01:18:03.520 --> 01:18:07.840]   whatever they are renting, loaning right now.
[01:18:07.840 --> 01:18:09.680]   And that seems-- I mean, the whole demo, they did--
[01:18:09.680 --> 01:18:12.400]   everything they did with Big Sur was done on that.
[01:18:12.400 --> 01:18:15.600]   That worked pretty well.
[01:18:15.600 --> 01:18:17.120]   We weren't saying, what's wrong with that?
[01:18:17.120 --> 01:18:19.520]   Why is that Maxo sluggish?
[01:18:19.520 --> 01:18:21.440]   And there were a lot of rumors about whether they were going
[01:18:21.440 --> 01:18:24.640]   to actually do Rosetta again, or whether they were going
[01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:27.760]   to force everybody to recompile or it wouldn't be there.
[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:29.440]   And of course, they did Rosetta again,
[01:18:29.440 --> 01:18:32.400]   which means that all of your apps that are currently
[01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:35.160]   compiled to Intel, if they haven't been updated yet,
[01:18:35.160 --> 01:18:35.800]   they'll run.
[01:18:35.800 --> 01:18:38.480]   They'll probably be a little slower, but they'll run.
[01:18:38.480 --> 01:18:42.800]   And the best chip transition is one where the user doesn't ever
[01:18:42.800 --> 01:18:44.520]   really notice it happened.
[01:18:44.520 --> 01:18:47.320]   And I think it's no accident that they called it Rosetta
[01:18:47.320 --> 01:18:49.920]   to an universal binary to.
[01:18:49.920 --> 01:18:51.640]   They want to emphasize, we've done this before.
[01:18:51.640 --> 01:18:53.160]   We know how to do this.
[01:18:53.160 --> 01:18:54.760]   And we're going to do the same thing.
[01:18:54.760 --> 01:18:56.720]   You know, it worked OK, right?
[01:18:56.720 --> 01:18:57.920]   How did it work last time?
[01:18:57.920 --> 01:18:59.520]   We're just going to be this-- what time is going to be.
[01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:01.440]   And it should be actually a lot easier, really.
[01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:02.720]   They've been making these chips.
[01:19:02.720 --> 01:19:06.200]   No company has done as many of these transitions
[01:19:06.200 --> 01:19:07.240]   as Apple has, right?
[01:19:07.240 --> 01:19:10.320]   They have transferred their major platform several times.
[01:19:10.320 --> 01:19:12.080]   And if anybody knows how to do it, it's them.
[01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:15.000]   And I agree, they're trying to maintain, like, look,
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:16.040]   all this stuff is going to work.
[01:19:16.040 --> 01:19:17.240]   It's going to be seamless.
[01:19:17.240 --> 01:19:20.160]   Frankly, I would not be surprised if some of the Rosetta
[01:19:20.160 --> 01:19:23.720]   apps run even better than expected, just because processor
[01:19:23.720 --> 01:19:25.920]   gains might mean they've got cycles to spare, right?
[01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:27.880]   Like, you might notice if you're doing something really
[01:19:27.880 --> 01:19:30.320]   intensive, but if you're running something that's
[01:19:30.320 --> 01:19:33.560]   like a word processor that hasn't been transferred over,
[01:19:33.560 --> 01:19:35.400]   you're probably not going to notice the difference.
[01:19:35.400 --> 01:19:37.200]   And that is exactly what they want.
[01:19:37.200 --> 01:19:37.700]   Right.
[01:19:37.700 --> 01:19:42.440]   All right, so we've talked about potential pitfalls.
[01:19:42.440 --> 01:19:45.080]   I don't want to sound too cheer-liter-y.
[01:19:45.080 --> 01:19:48.520]   But we talked about that.
[01:19:48.520 --> 01:19:50.480]   A couple of people in chatroom said,
[01:19:50.480 --> 01:19:53.360]   they should have skipped arm and gone to the next thing,
[01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:55.040]   whatever that is, risk of years, something.
[01:19:55.040 --> 01:19:58.120]   I don't know what the next thing is.
[01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:03.120]   We're acting as if alarm is golden mana from heaven.
[01:20:03.120 --> 01:20:06.360]   I'm sure our arm has other issues as well.
[01:20:06.360 --> 01:20:07.880]   But man, intel's been bad.
[01:20:07.880 --> 01:20:10.200]   I mean, they've had trouble getting the process down
[01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:11.520]   to 10 nanometers.
[01:20:11.520 --> 01:20:14.640]   They've heard horrific problems with their pipeline
[01:20:14.640 --> 01:20:15.640]   architecture.
[01:20:15.640 --> 01:20:19.640]   The prediction has caused all sorts of security issues
[01:20:19.640 --> 01:20:22.640]   that they just don't seem to be able to fix
[01:20:22.640 --> 01:20:23.640]   without telling performance.
[01:20:23.640 --> 01:20:25.480]   And keep in mind, it's not fair to say
[01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:26.760]   like arm versus intel, right?
[01:20:26.760 --> 01:20:29.440]   Because arm holdings is a patent licensing company,
[01:20:29.440 --> 01:20:31.640]   but it's Apple Silicon.
[01:20:31.640 --> 01:20:33.640]   This is why they call it that and not arm, right?
[01:20:33.640 --> 01:20:35.760]   It is Apple's design that they have
[01:20:35.760 --> 01:20:37.800]   for a relentless leap in pushing forward for years now.
[01:20:37.800 --> 01:20:39.320]   How much of arm is in this?
[01:20:39.320 --> 01:20:41.360]   I mean, they have to have some compatibility.
[01:20:41.360 --> 01:20:42.640]   They licensed the arm architecture,
[01:20:42.640 --> 01:20:44.480]   which means they can do whatever the hell they want.
[01:20:44.480 --> 01:20:46.560]   But they want some compatibility
[01:20:46.560 --> 01:20:47.800]   because they'd like to, for instance,
[01:20:47.800 --> 01:20:51.400]   be able to run other Linux that's designed for arm chips
[01:20:51.400 --> 01:20:52.240]   on Apple Silicon.
[01:20:52.240 --> 01:20:53.600]   How close will these be?
[01:20:53.600 --> 01:20:57.720]   I am not a processor person.
[01:20:57.720 --> 01:21:01.120]   So I mean, my guess is that there is an arm common,
[01:21:01.120 --> 01:21:03.240]   you know, instruction set that they have in common,
[01:21:03.240 --> 01:21:06.280]   but then they build around everything else around it.
[01:21:06.280 --> 01:21:09.280]   And it's all, I mean, my point is it's relentlessly driving
[01:21:09.280 --> 01:21:11.760]   toward Apple's hardware goals in a way
[01:21:11.760 --> 01:21:13.320]   that nobody else can do.
[01:21:13.320 --> 01:21:15.280]   So it is the next thing because Apple knows
[01:21:15.280 --> 01:21:16.600]   what devices it wants to build.
[01:21:16.600 --> 01:21:19.040]   And that Mac processor, when it comes out,
[01:21:19.040 --> 01:21:22.000]   is literally designed for those Macs that it's running on.
[01:21:22.000 --> 01:21:24.640]   It's not something taken off a shelf from a reference
[01:21:24.640 --> 01:21:26.720]   and put in a piece of metal.
[01:21:26.720 --> 01:21:29.640]   It's literally been designed over the last two or three years,
[01:21:29.640 --> 01:21:32.160]   specifically for the Macs that it's gonna run on.
[01:21:32.160 --> 01:21:34.400]   And that's why Apple has an advantage there.
[01:21:34.400 --> 01:21:36.320]   - In a way, that's why I'm so excited about this,
[01:21:36.320 --> 01:21:38.800]   because for the first time in Apple's history,
[01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:41.040]   they get to design the whole stack.
[01:21:41.040 --> 01:21:45.640]   And to me, the potential there is unlimited.
[01:21:45.640 --> 01:21:48.360]   Steven Sinofsky, former Microsoft guy,
[01:21:48.360 --> 01:21:52.800]   he was the Windows 8 guy, tweeted amidst all the details,
[01:21:52.800 --> 01:21:54.400]   I wanna take a moment to reflect,
[01:21:54.400 --> 01:21:57.080]   putting it in context to the past two decades.
[01:21:57.080 --> 01:21:58.920]   Quite simply, what we're seeing is some of the most
[01:21:58.920 --> 01:22:03.200]   remarkable product engineering over time in history.
[01:22:03.200 --> 01:22:08.200]   He was as ecstatic, maybe more so than I am.
[01:22:08.200 --> 01:22:09.880]   - He's got the scars from Longhorn, right?
[01:22:09.880 --> 01:22:11.440]   - He's been there.
[01:22:11.440 --> 01:22:14.760]   My jaw dropped when Tim Cook discussed the transition
[01:22:14.760 --> 01:22:16.360]   to Apple Silicon as a two year journey.
[01:22:16.360 --> 01:22:18.720]   First, that's like no time at all.
[01:22:18.720 --> 01:22:20.600]   Second, that's an incredibly long time
[01:22:20.600 --> 01:22:22.360]   to tell everyone how long it will take
[01:22:22.360 --> 01:22:24.040]   and that they should be patient.
[01:22:24.040 --> 01:22:27.520]   But really, it's incredibly brave when so much could change,
[01:22:27.520 --> 01:22:29.720]   more could go wrong.
[01:22:29.720 --> 01:22:31.480]   Every company does multi year planning,
[01:22:31.480 --> 01:22:33.880]   but everyone knows those plans mean little
[01:22:33.880 --> 01:22:35.200]   after one fiscal year.
[01:22:35.200 --> 01:22:37.960]   Apple's entirely different in that regard.
[01:22:37.960 --> 01:22:41.720]   He was extremely impressed,
[01:22:41.720 --> 01:22:44.560]   is extremely impressed by Apple's process.
[01:22:44.560 --> 01:22:48.560]   - Yeah, if I'll think about how long this has been going,
[01:22:48.560 --> 01:22:51.680]   we don't know, we hear like that this year's iPhone's
[01:22:51.680 --> 01:22:53.600]   already designed and this next year's iPhone
[01:22:53.600 --> 01:22:55.600]   is probably almost entirely designed already.
[01:22:55.600 --> 01:22:57.360]   Like we hear that they work ahead.
[01:22:57.360 --> 01:22:59.760]   But the one that I keep coming back to is Apple announced
[01:22:59.760 --> 01:23:02.960]   that it was gonna be getting rid of 32 bit apps on Mac OS.
[01:23:02.960 --> 01:23:07.560]   And they warned about that like five years ago.
[01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:10.440]   And then they said, we're gonna put a warning in
[01:23:10.440 --> 01:23:13.640]   that it won't run after the next version.
[01:23:13.640 --> 01:23:16.880]   And they put that in high Sierra saying,
[01:23:16.880 --> 01:23:18.920]   - They took way too long.
[01:23:18.920 --> 01:23:22.200]   - And then, it was this long process to do that.
[01:23:22.200 --> 01:23:24.760]   But looking back, what they were doing
[01:23:24.760 --> 01:23:26.240]   is clearing out all the garbage.
[01:23:26.240 --> 01:23:29.920]   One of the arguments about Catalina and Mojave
[01:23:29.920 --> 01:23:33.800]   were both that they actually said
[01:23:33.800 --> 01:23:36.960]   they were trying to realign the underpinnings of Mac OS
[01:23:36.960 --> 01:23:39.960]   because it and iPad OS and iOS had drifted
[01:23:39.960 --> 01:23:41.280]   over the course of the years.
[01:23:41.280 --> 01:23:43.400]   So like, this is like a five year plan
[01:23:43.400 --> 01:23:46.520]   that they had executed on, including very cleverly
[01:23:46.520 --> 01:23:50.760]   ripping out all the compatibility and blaming it on Catalina
[01:23:50.760 --> 01:23:53.840]   when it was probably ripped out for the Silicon,
[01:23:53.840 --> 01:23:54.720]   Apple Silicon, right?
[01:23:54.720 --> 01:23:55.680]   It was probably ripped out
[01:23:55.680 --> 01:24:00.680]   'cause they weren't gonna emulate Intel 32 on ARM 64.
[01:24:00.680 --> 01:24:02.840]   But they did it in steps.
[01:24:02.840 --> 01:24:04.200]   They warned everybody.
[01:24:04.200 --> 01:24:06.160]   They had confidence that they were gonna get there
[01:24:06.160 --> 01:24:07.000]   and they got there.
[01:24:07.000 --> 01:24:08.480]   And we complain a lot.
[01:24:08.480 --> 01:24:10.720]   There are a lot of things to complain about details
[01:24:10.720 --> 01:24:12.560]   of various Mac OS releases.
[01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:15.040]   But they, when Stephen Snoskey points out
[01:24:15.040 --> 01:24:16.400]   that they've been releasing these things
[01:24:16.400 --> 01:24:19.880]   kind of every year more or less for 20 years,
[01:24:19.880 --> 01:24:23.000]   it is impressive and they do make long-term plans
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.640]   and they do generally seem to hit their goals.
[01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:26.480]   - Yeah.
[01:24:26.480 --> 01:24:28.520]   I think for those of us, everybody on this panel
[01:24:28.520 --> 01:24:30.720]   who watch Apple closely,
[01:24:30.720 --> 01:24:34.080]   a lot of things clicked into place with this announcement.
[01:24:34.080 --> 01:24:36.920]   Even though we knew it was coming,
[01:24:36.920 --> 01:24:40.840]   everything we kind of go, oh, that's why they did this.
[01:24:40.840 --> 01:24:42.720]   That's why Catalyst exists.
[01:24:42.720 --> 01:24:44.800]   That's why replay.
[01:24:44.800 --> 01:24:48.560]   You talked Dan about the replay kit, which has been an iOS.
[01:24:48.560 --> 01:24:50.880]   Suddenly it's in Mac OS.
[01:24:50.880 --> 01:24:51.720]   - Yeah.
[01:24:51.720 --> 01:24:53.480]   - I thought that was really interesting.
[01:24:53.480 --> 01:24:54.920]   - There's a lot of stuff like that
[01:24:54.920 --> 01:24:58.200]   where because of the fact that iOS and Mac OS
[01:24:58.200 --> 01:25:00.440]   had different underpinnings and different layers, right?
[01:25:00.440 --> 01:25:02.400]   Like, and Jason mentioned earlier,
[01:25:02.400 --> 01:25:05.200]   what's fascinating about the iPhone and iPad stuff
[01:25:05.200 --> 01:25:07.240]   that's coming to the Mac is it's essentially built
[01:25:07.240 --> 01:25:10.520]   on the same technology that Catalyst was already using, right?
[01:25:10.520 --> 01:25:13.400]   So stuff like replay kit and other things
[01:25:13.400 --> 01:25:16.800]   that were developed for iOS can make their way over now
[01:25:16.800 --> 01:25:19.560]   with basically no problem whatsoever.
[01:25:19.560 --> 01:25:22.880]   And that's huge because it means that you're not,
[01:25:22.880 --> 01:25:24.120]   the thing that I've always come back to
[01:25:24.120 --> 01:25:28.880]   with the Mac OS, iPad OS, iOS is how much time
[01:25:28.880 --> 01:25:33.880]   does Apple wanna spend supporting two major disparate platforms?
[01:25:33.880 --> 01:25:35.760]   That's gotta be a headache, right?
[01:25:35.760 --> 01:25:38.120]   So the more stuff that they can share between them,
[01:25:38.120 --> 01:25:42.160]   and yes, iOS and Mac OS do share fundamental underpinnings,
[01:25:42.160 --> 01:25:44.880]   but as you spend this time and there's like,
[01:25:44.880 --> 01:25:45.800]   what we need to do different things,
[01:25:45.800 --> 01:25:48.040]   this is mobile, this is a desktop, et cetera,
[01:25:48.040 --> 01:25:49.800]   like it just gets to be more work.
[01:25:49.800 --> 01:25:53.120]   And so I think having, if not like a full-on convergence,
[01:25:53.120 --> 01:25:54.680]   they don't seem to wanna merge these things,
[01:25:54.680 --> 01:25:57.480]   but they want to reduce the amount of time
[01:25:57.480 --> 01:26:00.360]   that they have to spend supporting two different things
[01:26:00.360 --> 01:26:02.120]   with two wildly different use cases.
[01:26:02.120 --> 01:26:06.120]   So having that ability to bring stuff over from iOS
[01:26:06.120 --> 01:26:09.280]   to the Mac just super simply is huge.
[01:26:09.280 --> 01:26:11.440]   It's just a huge potential win for them.
[01:26:11.440 --> 01:26:14.360]   - Sometimes in business and in technology,
[01:26:14.360 --> 01:26:19.360]   they talk about flywheels, how the additional technologies
[01:26:19.360 --> 01:26:23.240]   can support each other in such a way
[01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:26.760]   that you get incredible synergies and incredible power
[01:26:26.760 --> 01:26:29.440]   and it continues to build and build and build
[01:26:29.440 --> 01:26:32.160]   and you very much feel like that's what Apple has been
[01:26:32.160 --> 01:26:34.200]   engaged in over the last 10 years.
[01:26:34.200 --> 01:26:36.440]   In fact, really since iPhone came out,
[01:26:36.440 --> 01:26:38.600]   but iPhone perhaps they didn't understand
[01:26:38.600 --> 01:26:40.360]   what a big transformation that was gonna make,
[01:26:40.360 --> 01:26:42.400]   maybe they did, but in a few years,
[01:26:42.400 --> 01:26:44.920]   it became very clear that that was gonna drive the company.
[01:26:44.920 --> 01:26:46.720]   And I think that was probably at the point
[01:26:46.720 --> 01:26:48.080]   where they started to say, you know,
[01:26:48.080 --> 01:26:49.840]   what we really should be doing is building
[01:26:49.840 --> 01:26:52.440]   an entire ecosystem around this,
[01:26:52.440 --> 01:26:54.360]   that builds one another,
[01:26:54.360 --> 01:26:57.840]   that can serve all our different customers
[01:26:57.840 --> 01:27:00.120]   and disparate niches better.
[01:27:00.120 --> 01:27:01.360]   And I think they found that.
[01:27:01.360 --> 01:27:03.520]   I think that that's really what they're doing here.
[01:27:03.520 --> 01:27:05.800]   - It is pretty rewarding in some ways to think about
[01:27:05.800 --> 01:27:08.080]   the fact that all the advances in time and energy
[01:27:08.080 --> 01:27:11.600]   they put into the iPhone eventually just benefits the Mac.
[01:27:11.600 --> 01:27:13.640]   After all these years of people being like,
[01:27:13.640 --> 01:27:15.160]   oh, they're forgetting about the Mac,
[01:27:15.160 --> 01:27:16.880]   all they care about is their mobile devices.
[01:27:16.880 --> 01:27:18.400]   They turned around like all that work we did.
[01:27:18.400 --> 01:27:19.240]   - Makes me so happy. - It's gonna make
[01:27:19.240 --> 01:27:20.360]   your Macs so much better.
[01:27:20.360 --> 01:27:21.200]   - Exactly.
[01:27:21.200 --> 01:27:23.240]   I was really feeling bereft.
[01:27:23.240 --> 01:27:24.840]   I felt like the Mac was about to go.
[01:27:24.840 --> 01:27:27.360]   We had many conversations, a Mac break weekly,
[01:27:27.360 --> 01:27:30.320]   where I said it's over and made me so sad.
[01:27:30.320 --> 01:27:33.160]   'Cause like most people, and actually Craig even said this
[01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:34.960]   when he was talking to John Gruber,
[01:27:34.960 --> 01:27:38.600]   we got into this, all of us at Apple started with the Mac.
[01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:41.200]   We got into this 'cause we loved the Mac.
[01:27:41.200 --> 01:27:43.960]   And I think it's very credible now when they say that,
[01:27:43.960 --> 01:27:46.560]   that they hadn't abandoned the Mac,
[01:27:46.560 --> 01:27:49.920]   that what they were really doing is creating a new system
[01:27:49.920 --> 01:27:51.360]   that the Mac was a big part of.
[01:27:51.360 --> 01:27:53.480]   And so I don't know who we are losing.
[01:27:53.480 --> 01:27:54.680]   I don't know what that sound means,
[01:27:54.680 --> 01:27:56.640]   but I guess everybody's still there.
[01:27:56.640 --> 01:27:58.960]   So good.
[01:27:58.960 --> 01:28:01.800]   So you agree with me, this is good.
[01:28:01.800 --> 01:28:05.800]   If nothing else, this is very good news for the Macintosh.
[01:28:05.800 --> 01:28:07.400]   - Yeah, they have the luxury of building
[01:28:07.400 --> 01:28:09.720]   their next generation platform off to the side,
[01:28:09.720 --> 01:28:11.800]   thinking about mobile, which is great,
[01:28:11.800 --> 01:28:13.600]   'cause that's sort of the future of computers,
[01:28:13.600 --> 01:28:15.040]   is these mobile devices.
[01:28:15.040 --> 01:28:17.600]   And then for all of us, it was that moment where we all,
[01:28:17.600 --> 01:28:20.280]   again, were like, what does this mean for the Mac?
[01:28:20.280 --> 01:28:22.760]   And it's nice to see them kind of plow that back
[01:28:22.760 --> 01:28:24.760]   into the Mac now, but that's the advantage
[01:28:24.760 --> 01:28:26.200]   that Apple had over Microsoft,
[01:28:26.200 --> 01:28:28.240]   which doesn't have that kind of thing
[01:28:28.240 --> 01:28:29.600]   that they could work on in parallel,
[01:28:29.600 --> 01:28:32.480]   is that Apple just spent a decade building
[01:28:32.480 --> 01:28:35.120]   by new paradigms for a lot of the classic computer stuff,
[01:28:35.120 --> 01:28:35.960]   new pointer.
[01:28:35.960 --> 01:28:37.920]   There's a great session, people should watch it,
[01:28:37.920 --> 01:28:39.800]   about pointer design on iPad,
[01:28:39.800 --> 01:28:41.760]   where they talk about how they reimagined
[01:28:41.760 --> 01:28:46.760]   that very old, like back to 1984 mouse cursor for iPad.
[01:28:47.720 --> 01:28:50.440]   And it's so brilliant that I'm a little surprised
[01:28:50.440 --> 01:28:53.720]   that it's not in Mac OS, I suspect it will be soon
[01:28:53.720 --> 01:28:55.800]   that they'll change the cursor maybe next year.
[01:28:55.800 --> 01:28:57.640]   But like, they got to invent that over here,
[01:28:57.640 --> 01:29:00.600]   they got to reinvent some things about file handling,
[01:29:00.600 --> 01:29:02.320]   and they got to rethink security.
[01:29:02.320 --> 01:29:06.280]   And they did that while the Mac got to stay the Mac.
[01:29:06.280 --> 01:29:08.440]   And now that it's far enough along,
[01:29:08.440 --> 01:29:10.320]   they're like, all right, well, now it's time
[01:29:10.320 --> 01:29:12.280]   to plow all of that stuff back into the Mac.
[01:29:12.280 --> 01:29:14.520]   And I do think it will make the Mac better ultimately.
[01:29:14.520 --> 01:29:16.480]   - Yeah, woo-hoo, that's all I can say.
[01:29:17.640 --> 01:29:19.920]   Lots more to talk about, we're gonna take a little break.
[01:29:19.920 --> 01:29:22.080]   Our show today brought to you by ExtraHop.
[01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:24.920]   ExtraHop is the new IT reality.
[01:29:24.920 --> 01:29:27.320]   Well, actually the new IT reality, as you all know,
[01:29:27.320 --> 01:29:31.680]   is people working from home remote access on a massive scale.
[01:29:31.680 --> 01:29:36.840]   And as a result, rapid cloud and multi-cloud adoption.
[01:29:36.840 --> 01:29:39.080]   Of course, we've seen this for a couple of years now,
[01:29:39.080 --> 01:29:42.000]   a steady increase in internet of things devices.
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:43.840]   And you know who loves all this?
[01:29:43.840 --> 01:29:47.040]   The criminals, a rise in cyber crime.
[01:29:47.040 --> 01:29:48.400]   So much more important than ever.
[01:29:48.400 --> 01:29:51.720]   Organizations see exactly what's going on
[01:29:51.720 --> 01:29:52.520]   in their environment.
[01:29:52.520 --> 01:29:55.320]   That cloud can't be a puffy little opaque cloud.
[01:29:55.320 --> 01:29:57.000]   You got to see into the cloud,
[01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.720]   to the data center all the way down to the customer.
[01:29:59.720 --> 01:30:02.200]   In order to protect and scale your business,
[01:30:02.200 --> 01:30:04.800]   you need more than just unified visibility.
[01:30:04.800 --> 01:30:08.440]   You need context so that you can understand what you're seeing.
[01:30:08.440 --> 01:30:11.240]   You can have an intelligence response.
[01:30:11.240 --> 01:30:13.600]   Teams can collaborate easily, can act fast,
[01:30:13.600 --> 01:30:16.000]   can fix problems.
[01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:17.360]   That's where you need extra hop.
[01:30:17.360 --> 01:30:20.360]   It helps you detect threats and performance issues
[01:30:20.360 --> 01:30:25.360]   up to 95% faster and respond 60% more effectively.
[01:30:25.360 --> 01:30:28.000]   Just take a look at the extra hop dashboard.
[01:30:28.000 --> 01:30:30.800]   You can see it right now if you go to extrahop.com/twit
[01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:31.960]   and I bet you look at it and go,
[01:30:31.960 --> 01:30:33.440]   "That's what I need.
[01:30:33.440 --> 01:30:35.880]   "I need that for our organization."
[01:30:35.880 --> 01:30:38.000]   That's I think what Wizards of the Coast said,
[01:30:38.000 --> 01:30:40.240]   extra hop helps keep your business secure and available.
[01:30:40.240 --> 01:30:43.440]   It's a SaaS based cloud native network
[01:30:43.440 --> 01:30:45.760]   with detection and response.
[01:30:45.760 --> 01:30:48.880]   They're a chief architect at Wizards of the Coast,
[01:30:48.880 --> 01:30:51.960]   uses it to secure and support the AWS cloud.
[01:30:51.960 --> 01:30:56.360]   Dan McDaniel, he's also their information security officer,
[01:30:56.360 --> 01:30:57.920]   said, "There's no other company
[01:30:57.920 --> 01:31:00.320]   "that aligns to supporting our DevOps model,
[01:31:00.320 --> 01:31:03.240]   "the speed and the lack of friction and extra hop."
[01:31:03.240 --> 01:31:05.000]   Ulta Beauty.
[01:31:05.000 --> 01:31:07.000]   You can see that on the page right there.
[01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:09.960]   They use extra hop to secure their Google cloud
[01:31:09.960 --> 01:31:12.360]   and to keep their networking and security teams aligned
[01:31:12.360 --> 01:31:15.640]   so engineers have more time to focus on innovation.
[01:31:15.640 --> 01:31:17.360]   Senior IT engineer John Crease says,
[01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:19.880]   "Before extra hop, we had limited visibility
[01:31:19.880 --> 01:31:21.920]   "into what was going on in the cloud.
[01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:25.840]   "But now we can quickly identify vulnerabilities and exploits
[01:31:25.840 --> 01:31:28.120]   "and understand how our applications are performing
[01:31:28.120 --> 01:31:29.480]   "in the cloud.
[01:31:29.480 --> 01:31:33.200]   "Take control of your cloud security with extra hop."
[01:31:33.200 --> 01:31:35.040]   I'll tell you what, if you go and you take a look
[01:31:35.040 --> 01:31:37.680]   at the companies, the brands that use extra hop.
[01:31:37.680 --> 01:31:39.560]   And if you take a look at the dashboard right now
[01:31:39.560 --> 01:31:41.520]   at extrahop.com/twit,
[01:31:41.520 --> 01:31:42.960]   that full product demo,
[01:31:42.960 --> 01:31:45.080]   I think you're gonna be so impressed.
[01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:47.520]   My reaction was, I need this now.
[01:31:47.520 --> 01:31:49.840]   I need to know now.
[01:31:49.840 --> 01:31:52.160]   Get tips on securing and supporting remote access.
[01:31:52.160 --> 01:31:53.480]   Check out the full product demo.
[01:31:53.480 --> 01:31:57.880]   Extrahop.com/twit.
[01:31:57.880 --> 01:32:00.520]   This is the kind of useful intelligence
[01:32:00.520 --> 01:32:05.520]   that can make or break a cloud deployment extrahop.com/twit.
[01:32:05.520 --> 01:32:09.080]   We thank them for their support.
[01:32:09.080 --> 01:32:11.200]   We had a fun week this week.
[01:32:11.200 --> 01:32:12.040]   What do we do?
[01:32:12.040 --> 01:32:15.640]   We did a scavenger hunt on Twit after hours.
[01:32:15.640 --> 01:32:17.840]   Of course, we spent a lot of time talking about Apple.
[01:32:17.840 --> 01:32:20.720]   We've made a little movie for your enjoyment watch.
[01:32:20.720 --> 01:32:22.640]   Previously on Twit.
[01:32:22.640 --> 01:32:23.480]   - Are you kidding?
[01:32:23.480 --> 01:32:25.520]   This is you in college?
[01:32:25.520 --> 01:32:28.600]   - I had my, yes, my required street sign
[01:32:28.600 --> 01:32:30.600]   and posters on the wall.
[01:32:30.600 --> 01:32:33.800]   And I haven't changed a bit since then.
[01:32:33.800 --> 01:32:34.800]   (tires screeching)
[01:32:34.800 --> 01:32:35.840]   Twit news.
[01:32:35.840 --> 01:32:38.720]   - WKVDC is an incredibly important event
[01:32:38.720 --> 01:32:41.600]   to Apple, our developers and our users.
[01:32:41.600 --> 01:32:43.360]   - It applies in the full conversation
[01:32:43.360 --> 01:32:44.640]   or you can view them as a--
[01:32:44.640 --> 01:32:45.520]   - That's cool.
[01:32:45.520 --> 01:32:46.360]   Give me app ready.
[01:32:46.360 --> 01:32:48.520]   - Give me app mentions, give me app mentions.
[01:32:48.520 --> 01:32:49.920]   - We're introducing mention.
[01:32:49.920 --> 01:32:50.760]   - Yes!
[01:32:50.760 --> 01:32:52.560]   - This mentions you can just type someone's name
[01:32:52.560 --> 01:32:54.120]   to direct a message to that.
[01:32:54.120 --> 01:32:55.720]   - Yes, I would miss being so long.
[01:32:55.720 --> 01:32:57.200]   (tires screeching)
[01:32:57.200 --> 01:32:58.280]   - Hands on Android.
[01:32:58.280 --> 01:33:02.560]   - As of now, Stadia is not officially supported on Android TV.
[01:33:02.560 --> 01:33:04.160]   So you're gonna need to jump through some hoops,
[01:33:04.160 --> 01:33:06.600]   but if you really wanna play Stadia games
[01:33:06.600 --> 01:33:09.680]   on your Android TV device, that's why I'm here.
[01:33:09.680 --> 01:33:12.520]   And that's what I'm gonna show you how to do.
[01:33:12.520 --> 01:33:13.560]   - Windows Weekly.
[01:33:13.560 --> 01:33:15.880]   - So we're talking about apples moved
[01:33:15.880 --> 01:33:17.480]   from Intel to Apple Silicon.
[01:33:17.480 --> 01:33:19.840]   Anyone who cares at all about Windows needs to watch
[01:33:19.840 --> 01:33:21.120]   this part of that presentation
[01:33:21.120 --> 01:33:23.480]   because they just blew Microsoft out of the water
[01:33:23.480 --> 01:33:25.000]   and they are never gonna look back.
[01:33:25.000 --> 01:33:26.400]   What they're doing is incredible.
[01:33:26.400 --> 01:33:28.080]   And I hate this company.
[01:33:28.080 --> 01:33:29.920]   (laughing)
[01:33:29.920 --> 01:33:30.760]   And I'm saying that.
[01:33:30.760 --> 01:33:32.160]   - Twit, bring your brain.
[01:33:32.160 --> 01:33:33.560]   We'll do the rest.
[01:33:33.560 --> 01:33:36.160]   (laughing)
[01:33:36.160 --> 01:33:37.480]   - And we have not yet innovated.
[01:33:37.480 --> 01:33:40.120]   - Just me sitting there with an iPad facing him,
[01:33:40.120 --> 01:33:41.680]   he was doing all the fun things.
[01:33:41.680 --> 01:33:44.720]   - Because we're all looking forward to a more hopeful tomorrow.
[01:33:44.720 --> 01:33:45.560]   - There's lots of room.
[01:33:45.560 --> 01:33:46.400]   I could've sat there.
[01:33:46.400 --> 01:33:47.800]   I could've done the whole thing.
[01:33:47.800 --> 01:33:49.840]   They just didn't invite me.
[01:33:49.840 --> 01:33:51.240]   At least this time I don't feel bad
[01:33:51.240 --> 01:33:52.920]   about not getting an invitation, right?
[01:33:52.920 --> 01:33:53.760]   (laughing)
[01:33:53.760 --> 01:33:55.360]   - That was the first time I think I haven't been
[01:33:55.360 --> 01:33:57.000]   in an Apple event in like 20 years.
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:33:57.840]   - Is it really?
[01:33:57.840 --> 01:33:58.680]   - It was super weird.
[01:33:58.680 --> 01:33:59.520]   - Wow.
[01:33:59.520 --> 01:34:01.160]   Were you disappointed it was prerecorded?
[01:34:01.160 --> 01:34:03.200]   Did you want it to be a little more live?
[01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:06.080]   - I thought they did a great job with it.
[01:34:06.080 --> 01:34:07.720]   And having it open on the Steve Jobs Theater
[01:34:07.720 --> 01:34:10.880]   was super smart on their part.
[01:34:10.880 --> 01:34:12.960]   I liked the pacing of it.
[01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:18.080]   I would've liked them to try it live
[01:34:18.080 --> 01:34:20.320]   because I think it would be fun at the same time.
[01:34:20.320 --> 01:34:22.360]   It's Apple, they want complete control over it.
[01:34:22.360 --> 01:34:23.520]   Why would they make it live?
[01:34:23.520 --> 01:34:26.360]   - Yeah, there was just no way that was gonna be like.
[01:34:26.360 --> 01:34:29.680]   And those drone shots were amazing, although Alex,
[01:34:29.680 --> 01:34:30.520]   I thought they were great.
[01:34:30.520 --> 01:34:32.320]   Alex, as you said, well, we looked a little on study.
[01:34:32.320 --> 01:34:34.200]   I thought, Alex, come on, enjoy.
[01:34:34.200 --> 01:34:35.920]   (laughing)
[01:34:35.920 --> 01:34:36.760]   - Alex.
[01:34:36.760 --> 01:34:38.120]   - Although, I have to admit,
[01:34:38.120 --> 01:34:42.000]   Craig acted like we'd never seen the campus via drone.
[01:34:42.000 --> 01:34:45.040]   When of course, that's all we saw for years
[01:34:45.040 --> 01:34:48.080]   was third party drone shots as they built the campus.
[01:34:48.080 --> 01:34:50.840]   But that's okay, Craig, we know you never heard about that.
[01:34:50.840 --> 01:34:52.160]   Never.
[01:34:52.160 --> 01:34:54.440]   - There's definitely a trick with the,
[01:34:54.440 --> 01:34:55.720]   I think the Apple executives,
[01:34:55.720 --> 01:34:56.840]   they're super well coached.
[01:34:56.840 --> 01:34:59.240]   They really spent a lot of time doing these things.
[01:34:59.240 --> 01:35:02.000]   But it is funny, one of my co-hosts over one of the podcast,
[01:35:02.000 --> 01:35:04.160]   I do point out that Craig has the same level
[01:35:04.160 --> 01:35:05.440]   and enthusiasm for everything.
[01:35:05.440 --> 01:35:08.000]   He's like, you can run iPhone apps on the Mac, that's great.
[01:35:08.000 --> 01:35:10.320]   Also, there's a new button that we've secured.
[01:35:10.320 --> 01:35:12.960]   It's like you gotta measure that a little better
[01:35:12.960 --> 01:35:15.320]   because not everything is an 11.
[01:35:15.320 --> 01:35:20.060]   - They're good marketers, they always have been.
[01:35:20.060 --> 01:35:24.600]   Everybody and their brother got to interview Craig
[01:35:24.600 --> 01:35:26.060]   and we didn't even try,
[01:35:26.060 --> 01:35:28.000]   probably 'cause they would have laughed at us.
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:30.200]   But also, I hate interviewing executives
[01:35:30.200 --> 01:35:32.440]   'cause they are perfectly coached.
[01:35:32.440 --> 01:35:33.680]   - Yeah, I've got an interview.
[01:35:33.680 --> 01:35:35.080]   - They're still on task.
[01:35:35.080 --> 01:35:35.920]   - Yeah.
[01:35:35.920 --> 01:35:37.840]   - I've got an interview coming out tomorrow
[01:35:37.840 --> 01:35:40.080]   on my podcast to upgrade with a couple of people
[01:35:40.080 --> 01:35:42.320]   who work at Apple, but they are not at that top level.
[01:35:42.320 --> 01:35:43.160]   - At the years.
[01:35:43.160 --> 01:35:44.000]   - They're one level down.
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:44.840]   - Yeah.
[01:35:44.840 --> 01:35:46.680]   - And they're still coached and there are moments
[01:35:46.680 --> 01:35:49.400]   where you can, and I've interviewed some other people
[01:35:49.400 --> 01:35:52.200]   across over the years, mostly at that lower level.
[01:35:52.200 --> 01:35:55.800]   And they're very knowledgeable and they really wanna dive in
[01:35:55.800 --> 01:35:58.520]   and it helps kind of conflict with their training
[01:35:58.520 --> 01:36:00.600]   of sticking to the talking points.
[01:36:00.600 --> 01:36:02.120]   And it's not like they deviate,
[01:36:02.120 --> 01:36:05.160]   but they go a little more in depth
[01:36:05.160 --> 01:36:06.760]   because they know it a little more in depth.
[01:36:06.760 --> 01:36:08.560]   And I think you're right, there is,
[01:36:08.560 --> 01:36:11.080]   I never envy John Gruber interviewing
[01:36:11.080 --> 01:36:15.840]   super high level executives only because they are so well-trained
[01:36:15.840 --> 01:36:18.520]   that you are probably not gonna hear.
[01:36:18.520 --> 01:36:19.600]   There are tidbits here and there,
[01:36:19.600 --> 01:36:21.320]   but it's hard to get little tidbits out of them
[01:36:21.320 --> 01:36:25.200]   because they are so on brand on message and well-trained.
[01:36:25.200 --> 01:36:26.720]   - What you agreed about this,
[01:36:26.720 --> 01:36:27.560]   I just wanted to add,
[01:36:27.560 --> 01:36:29.160]   what was great about this year's format
[01:36:29.160 --> 01:36:31.240]   and being the fact that they filmed it all ahead of time
[01:36:31.240 --> 01:36:33.360]   was that I think it also gave them the possibility
[01:36:33.360 --> 01:36:36.240]   of bringing in so many different presenters
[01:36:36.240 --> 01:36:38.600]   not only exactly- - Oh, to see Johnny Sharooji
[01:36:38.600 --> 01:36:40.840]   for the first time ever.
[01:36:40.840 --> 01:36:45.080]   - Yes, right, because they don't have to worry about training them.
[01:36:45.080 --> 01:36:48.280]   Here's how you speak in front of an audience of 5,000 people.
[01:36:48.280 --> 01:36:49.800]   That is a different skill from,
[01:36:49.800 --> 01:36:53.000]   here's how you speak to someone in a room
[01:36:53.000 --> 01:36:55.000]   with a camera shooting you.
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:56.840]   And that means you can probably bring in
[01:36:56.840 --> 01:36:58.000]   a lot more different executives,
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:36:59.640]   which also gives them an opportunity
[01:36:59.640 --> 01:37:01.800]   to showcase a much more diverse pool
[01:37:01.800 --> 01:37:03.160]   of people working on these products,
[01:37:03.160 --> 01:37:04.360]   which is also to their benefit.
[01:37:04.360 --> 01:37:06.800]   So I think that's actually another big effect
[01:37:06.800 --> 01:37:08.160]   of not doing this live,
[01:37:08.160 --> 01:37:10.320]   is it gives them way more control and flexibility
[01:37:10.320 --> 01:37:11.560]   over who is involved in it.
[01:37:11.560 --> 01:37:13.120]   - That's a huge point, in fact,
[01:37:13.120 --> 01:37:14.960]   I neglected to make that point,
[01:37:14.960 --> 01:37:16.760]   but you're spot on,
[01:37:16.760 --> 01:37:18.040]   but you put people in front of stage,
[01:37:18.040 --> 01:37:20.280]   in front of thousands of people.
[01:37:20.280 --> 01:37:21.360]   - Scary. - Most people seize up.
[01:37:21.360 --> 01:37:22.200]   It's terrifying. - Yeah.
[01:37:22.200 --> 01:37:23.920]   - It's hard to do a good job.
[01:37:23.920 --> 01:37:25.880]   And who knows if Johnny Sharooji
[01:37:25.880 --> 01:37:27.840]   is scared of an audience or not,
[01:37:27.840 --> 01:37:31.720]   but getting him to talk about Apple Silicon,
[01:37:31.720 --> 01:37:34.680]   that's the guy you wanna have talk about Apple Silicon, right?
[01:37:34.680 --> 01:37:35.520]   - Absolutely.
[01:37:35.520 --> 01:37:38.480]   - I'd much rather hear Johnny than Phil Schiller explain it.
[01:37:38.480 --> 01:37:42.640]   So at least to that extent,
[01:37:42.640 --> 01:37:45.440]   it wasn't just a marketing piece.
[01:37:45.440 --> 01:37:47.440]   Now, have you ever been in that lab?
[01:37:47.440 --> 01:37:49.920]   Was that a set or is that the actual lab?
[01:37:49.920 --> 01:37:51.440]   That felt like a set to me.
[01:37:51.440 --> 01:37:54.320]   - I think you know they-- - I think that lab.
[01:37:54.320 --> 01:37:56.920]   - I was measuring out where they've been,
[01:37:56.920 --> 01:37:58.360]   I mean, Apple Park, I haven't been anywhere
[01:37:58.360 --> 01:37:59.800]   with the Steve Jobs Theater at Apple Park,
[01:37:59.800 --> 01:38:02.400]   but it felt very much like they came up
[01:38:02.400 --> 01:38:04.280]   with a bunch of different spaces.
[01:38:04.280 --> 01:38:06.680]   If you watch all the videos with the developers too,
[01:38:06.680 --> 01:38:08.480]   they're like, there are people who are
[01:38:08.480 --> 01:38:09.600]   on the outside of the ring,
[01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:11.760]   looking out at the trees on the outside of the ring.
[01:38:11.760 --> 01:38:13.040]   They're people on the inside of the ring,
[01:38:13.040 --> 01:38:14.760]   and you're looking at the little rainbow stage.
[01:38:14.760 --> 01:38:16.040]   They're people who are in the lobby,
[01:38:16.040 --> 01:38:17.680]   like Craig Federighi was,
[01:38:17.680 --> 01:38:19.800]   the lobby of the Steve Jobs Theater
[01:38:19.800 --> 01:38:21.720]   on one of those two levels of lobby.
[01:38:21.720 --> 01:38:24.080]   And I suspect that the Johnny Sharooji stuff
[01:38:24.080 --> 01:38:28.360]   was similarly just in an interior space somewhere.
[01:38:28.360 --> 01:38:30.160]   - Dressed. - And not his actual lab,
[01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:32.520]   but it made for a good joke, right?
[01:38:32.520 --> 01:38:33.560]   Like it's the secret.
[01:38:33.560 --> 01:38:35.840]   And all the music they played in an entire segment
[01:38:35.840 --> 01:38:37.040]   is all like spy music.
[01:38:37.040 --> 01:38:38.800]   - I was Craig. - Yeah, that's Craig.
[01:38:38.800 --> 01:38:40.960]   - They made a mockup that gets smart.
[01:38:40.960 --> 01:38:42.360]   I thought it was the get smart set.
[01:38:42.360 --> 01:38:44.840]   Duh, duh, duh, with the doors going open,
[01:38:44.840 --> 01:38:46.240]   and I thought that was great. - Yeah, yeah.
[01:38:46.240 --> 01:38:48.120]   - Yeah, I loved that. - But it can pass Craig too.
[01:38:48.120 --> 01:38:49.480]   I was like, they went past Craig,
[01:38:49.480 --> 01:38:50.840]   and I was like, wait, was that Craig?
[01:38:50.840 --> 01:38:51.920]   And then they came back to him later,
[01:38:51.920 --> 01:38:54.440]   and he was like, that's weird.
[01:38:54.440 --> 01:38:56.200]   - They had fun doing it.
[01:38:56.200 --> 01:38:57.040]   You know what? - Yeah.
[01:38:57.040 --> 01:38:57.880]   - That's great.
[01:38:57.880 --> 01:38:59.920]   That's the best you can do.
[01:38:59.920 --> 01:39:02.080]   - That's the kind of production value stuff too,
[01:39:02.080 --> 01:39:03.920]   that actually does make it fun,
[01:39:03.920 --> 01:39:05.680]   that you couldn't watch it live.
[01:39:05.680 --> 01:39:07.320]   It wasn't just somebody,
[01:39:07.320 --> 01:39:11.280]   it wasn't just Tim Cook sitting on that stage.
[01:39:11.280 --> 01:39:12.120]   - That would have been bad.
[01:39:12.120 --> 01:39:14.160]   - An empty audience behind him the entire time.
[01:39:14.160 --> 01:39:16.800]   There was all these fun things that got to happen.
[01:39:16.800 --> 01:39:20.040]   - And actually, having watched the similar presentation
[01:39:20.040 --> 01:39:22.240]   at Microsoft's Build Developer Conference,
[01:39:22.240 --> 01:39:23.600]   Microsoft got that too,
[01:39:23.600 --> 01:39:26.920]   and did a lot of the same kind of fun, interesting stuff.
[01:39:26.920 --> 01:39:31.640]   And frankly, I never wanna go back to Can to stage presentations,
[01:39:31.640 --> 01:39:34.120]   and I think this is great, this is the way to do it.
[01:39:34.120 --> 01:39:36.160]   And yeah, if you have to have one in one somehow,
[01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:37.880]   otherwise that's fine, but.
[01:39:37.880 --> 01:39:39.320]   - If you look at the developer sessions,
[01:39:39.320 --> 01:39:40.520]   they also, and those are--
[01:39:40.520 --> 01:39:42.120]   - You watched all of them, by the way.
[01:39:42.120 --> 01:39:44.480]   Let me give you a plug, 'cause six colors,
[01:39:44.480 --> 01:39:47.200]   you watched-- - You watched a lot of sessions.
[01:39:47.200 --> 01:39:49.280]   - Holy cow. - That was a lot.
[01:39:49.280 --> 01:39:50.560]   - Not all of them, that would have taken--
[01:39:50.560 --> 01:39:52.680]   - There were what, 607? - Oh, okay.
[01:39:52.680 --> 01:39:54.680]   - There were a lot. - But I feel like--
[01:39:54.680 --> 01:39:57.280]   - There was a lot, you did the best coverage.
[01:39:57.280 --> 01:39:58.560]   I felt like in many cases,
[01:39:58.560 --> 01:40:00.560]   I didn't have to watch the sessions,
[01:40:00.560 --> 01:40:03.640]   'cause you did, your coverage was just phenomenal.
[01:40:03.640 --> 01:40:04.480]   Well done. - You watched,
[01:40:04.480 --> 01:40:06.320]   so you don't have to. - Oh, yeah, yeah, right.
[01:40:06.320 --> 01:40:09.200]   - But if you look, there, those presenters,
[01:40:09.200 --> 01:40:10.440]   although less polished,
[01:40:10.440 --> 01:40:12.320]   because these are often the engineers,
[01:40:12.320 --> 01:40:13.920]   or designers involved with it,
[01:40:13.920 --> 01:40:16.200]   they put a lot of personalities,
[01:40:16.200 --> 01:40:17.960]   so like there would be people with like little,
[01:40:17.960 --> 01:40:19.400]   there was a guy with a monocle,
[01:40:19.400 --> 01:40:21.880]   and he had a newton on the table.
[01:40:21.880 --> 01:40:23.400]   - Wow. - It was a stuffed animal
[01:40:23.400 --> 01:40:24.760]   on a table, there was one session
[01:40:24.760 --> 01:40:27.400]   where all the slides, when they cut away from the presenter,
[01:40:27.400 --> 01:40:29.040]   there was a shot of, I think,
[01:40:29.040 --> 01:40:31.840]   the presenters' hands doing a Rubik's Cube.
[01:40:31.840 --> 01:40:34.600]   Like, there was one session, which was about proximity,
[01:40:34.600 --> 01:40:36.640]   which is actually using the ultra wide band chip
[01:40:36.640 --> 01:40:39.280]   and the iPhone 11 to detect the location
[01:40:39.280 --> 01:40:42.000]   of another device with an ultra wide band chip.
[01:40:42.000 --> 01:40:44.280]   And in that one, the speaker just leaves the table
[01:40:44.280 --> 01:40:46.880]   and begins wandering around the room until he finds it,
[01:40:46.880 --> 01:40:48.760]   and then he gets a big thumbs up to the camera.
[01:40:48.760 --> 01:40:49.600]   It's hilarious.
[01:40:49.600 --> 01:40:53.120]   So like, although it was beautifully art directed
[01:40:53.120 --> 01:40:54.880]   and like the way they shot it was nice,
[01:40:54.880 --> 01:40:57.400]   they also made a point of giving, yeah, there you go,
[01:40:57.400 --> 01:40:59.040]   that's radar the yard vark.
[01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:03.080]   Everybody got a little chance to express their personality
[01:41:03.080 --> 01:41:06.120]   a little bit, and I think that that's super important,
[01:41:06.120 --> 01:41:08.520]   because it's so easy to view Apple as a black box,
[01:41:08.520 --> 01:41:10.760]   a monolith, and this incredibly expensive company
[01:41:10.760 --> 01:41:15.360]   that, you know, it controls our world and blah, blah, blah.
[01:41:15.360 --> 01:41:16.640]   It's a different thing to have it like,
[01:41:16.640 --> 01:41:18.680]   oh, there's a guy with the art vark, you know,
[01:41:18.680 --> 01:41:21.280]   and it humanizes them, and that's good for Apple.
[01:41:21.280 --> 01:41:23.200]   It's good for you, but it's also good.
[01:41:23.200 --> 01:41:26.120]   - Ideally what you do is you demonstrate
[01:41:26.120 --> 01:41:30.960]   that you are in fact a collection of individualistic geniuses.
[01:41:30.960 --> 01:41:33.120]   What you don't want, and of course,
[01:41:33.120 --> 01:41:34.880]   from a corporate point of view,
[01:41:34.880 --> 01:41:36.960]   I know I work in a business, I know what it's like,
[01:41:36.960 --> 01:41:38.840]   you want everything to be homogenized,
[01:41:38.840 --> 01:41:41.280]   'cause the last thing you want is a superstar.
[01:41:41.280 --> 01:41:43.240]   Or maybe you have a Johnny Ive,
[01:41:43.240 --> 01:41:45.040]   you have one or two superstars.
[01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:48.000]   But really, you'd be much better off saying,
[01:41:48.000 --> 01:41:50.160]   do you know that Apple has 1,000
[01:41:50.160 --> 01:41:53.480]   of the smartest people in the world designing these chips?
[01:41:53.480 --> 01:41:56.120]   And here's a few of them, that's a really big,
[01:41:56.120 --> 01:41:57.320]   that's a good message.
[01:41:57.320 --> 01:41:59.240]   - I'll tell you, watching all those sessions,
[01:41:59.240 --> 01:42:03.800]   what I got was Apple has, and Steve Jobs really just wanted
[01:42:03.800 --> 01:42:05.720]   to be the face of it, not really talking about it,
[01:42:05.720 --> 01:42:06.880]   it was pretty people gonna get poached.
[01:42:06.880 --> 01:42:09.520]   But like, we were getting the names of everybody,
[01:42:09.520 --> 01:42:13.040]   we were getting their titles, and then if you talk,
[01:42:13.040 --> 01:42:14.960]   I mean, there was a lot of diversity
[01:42:14.960 --> 01:42:17.000]   that we don't usually see in the state of the union
[01:42:17.000 --> 01:42:18.920]   and the keynote, but if you watch these sessions,
[01:42:18.920 --> 01:42:20.320]   you get the distinct impression,
[01:42:20.320 --> 01:42:22.080]   and it is the impression Apple wanted to give,
[01:42:22.080 --> 01:42:24.600]   but it's still hard not to leave with this idea
[01:42:24.600 --> 01:42:28.200]   that Apple has people from all over the world,
[01:42:28.200 --> 01:42:30.640]   who are the best at what they do,
[01:42:30.640 --> 01:42:33.960]   who come to Cupertino to Apple Park and build their stuff,
[01:42:33.960 --> 01:42:37.880]   because they were men and women from all over the world
[01:42:37.880 --> 01:42:40.400]   in those presentations, it was really remarkable.
[01:42:40.400 --> 01:42:42.760]   There were some people who were like me,
[01:42:42.760 --> 01:42:43.840]   middle-aged white guys,
[01:42:43.840 --> 01:42:46.840]   they were there, but they were there.
[01:42:46.840 --> 01:42:47.840]   - There was one guy. - There was one guy.
[01:42:47.840 --> 01:42:49.120]   - Much more rare.
[01:42:49.120 --> 01:42:51.960]   - Who was the guy, a little chubby,
[01:42:51.960 --> 01:42:53.800]   he was talking about the chips,
[01:42:53.800 --> 01:42:55.440]   he was in the Steve Jobs Theater,
[01:42:55.440 --> 01:42:57.120]   I took one look at him, I said,
[01:42:57.120 --> 01:42:58.560]   he's been there since the beginning,
[01:42:58.560 --> 01:43:00.800]   and in fact, he was the guy who came to Apple
[01:43:00.800 --> 01:43:04.000]   to do the A4 chip, and you could tell, long time,
[01:43:04.000 --> 01:43:06.640]   he's a 20-year guy, you could tell, you could just tell.
[01:43:06.640 --> 01:43:08.360]   - Those guys are there, but I mean,
[01:43:08.360 --> 01:43:10.920]   the gestalt of the event really was that it's--
[01:43:10.920 --> 01:43:12.640]   - Young, super smart, yeah.
[01:43:12.640 --> 01:43:15.360]   - Yeah, yeah, and again, that's good PR,
[01:43:15.360 --> 01:43:17.680]   but also those people exist,
[01:43:17.680 --> 01:43:20.360]   and they're presenting because they are the people
[01:43:20.360 --> 01:43:22.480]   working on those products and those features.
[01:43:22.480 --> 01:43:26.080]   - And also, Kudos to Apple to let them be themselves
[01:43:26.080 --> 01:43:27.240]   a little bit. - Oh, Thai guy?
[01:43:27.240 --> 01:43:28.600]   - Yeah, both Thai guy.
[01:43:28.600 --> 01:43:30.800]   I think that's really important,
[01:43:30.800 --> 01:43:33.280]   and I think that's a message Apple should,
[01:43:33.280 --> 01:43:34.880]   it's one of the things that I think,
[01:43:34.880 --> 01:43:38.520]   all the big tech companies start to look a little homogeneous.
[01:43:38.520 --> 01:43:41.240]   You look, Microsoft is just this blank wall,
[01:43:41.240 --> 01:43:42.600]   Google, it's a blank wall.
[01:43:42.600 --> 01:43:45.000]   What you really wanna tell people is,
[01:43:45.000 --> 01:43:46.360]   no, these are the best,
[01:43:46.360 --> 01:43:48.920]   Google used to have that kind of gestalt,
[01:43:48.920 --> 01:43:51.480]   these are the best minds, they're all PhDs,
[01:43:51.480 --> 01:43:53.280]   they've lost that long ago.
[01:43:53.280 --> 01:43:55.720]   It seems like a bunch of stoners at this point.
[01:43:55.720 --> 01:43:58.600]   Okay, can't focus on one thing for a minute,
[01:43:58.600 --> 01:44:02.080]   but if Apple could convince, and I think it's true,
[01:44:02.080 --> 01:44:05.840]   but Apple should show this, we have the money,
[01:44:05.840 --> 01:44:08.160]   we have the wherewithal, we have the cache,
[01:44:08.160 --> 01:44:12.040]   we have the stock price to get the best people in the world.
[01:44:12.040 --> 01:44:14.480]   And that's who we've got working for you
[01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:17.840]   to make this product, that's a very strong message,
[01:44:17.840 --> 01:44:19.160]   I like that.
[01:44:19.160 --> 01:44:20.760]   Well, was there anything in the,
[01:44:20.760 --> 01:44:23.880]   I'm not gonna be able to all watch all of these,
[01:44:23.880 --> 01:44:26.320]   what should I, which ones are important to watch?
[01:44:26.320 --> 01:44:28.480]   Dan, you saw hundreds.
[01:44:28.480 --> 01:44:31.120]   - I, yeah, a lot, maybe not hundreds,
[01:44:31.120 --> 01:44:32.480]   but I saw a bunch of them.
[01:44:32.480 --> 01:44:35.280]   I thought there were a lot of really good ones,
[01:44:35.280 --> 01:44:37.840]   I actually was watching a bunch of the ones on security,
[01:44:37.840 --> 01:44:40.160]   'cause I find that that's just an interest of mine.
[01:44:40.160 --> 01:44:45.240]   So for example, I watched a great one about bringing
[01:44:45.240 --> 01:44:47.200]   Face ID and Touch ID to the web,
[01:44:47.200 --> 01:44:49.840]   so you'll be able to go and get your test of the web.
[01:44:49.840 --> 01:44:50.880]   It's great, it's super cool,
[01:44:50.880 --> 01:44:52.880]   but what's fascinating and what I love about it,
[01:44:52.880 --> 01:44:56.200]   was watching something, and it's this typical fashion
[01:44:56.200 --> 01:44:59.520]   where Apple's like, this is great, look how we're doing this.
[01:44:59.520 --> 01:45:01.400]   And then they mention this whole other thing,
[01:45:01.400 --> 01:45:02.960]   they're like, oh, for optional security,
[01:45:02.960 --> 01:45:05.760]   there's this whole other process called attestation,
[01:45:05.760 --> 01:45:09.320]   where essentially your site can query the device maker
[01:45:09.320 --> 01:45:12.760]   and make sure, like that's, this is actually this device,
[01:45:12.760 --> 01:45:14.680]   like we're looking at an iPhone,
[01:45:14.680 --> 01:45:17.240]   and it does have Face ID, like we can confirm that,
[01:45:17.240 --> 01:45:19.880]   'cause we made that device and like we can check it all out.
[01:45:19.880 --> 01:45:21.160]   And they're like, that's great, look,
[01:45:21.160 --> 01:45:23.680]   that's something that banks and all their high security places
[01:45:23.680 --> 01:45:26.280]   might need, and then they're like, but you know what,
[01:45:26.280 --> 01:45:28.120]   it turns out that you could actually,
[01:45:28.120 --> 01:45:29.640]   that could have a privacy problem,
[01:45:29.640 --> 01:45:31.600]   because when you issue these certificates
[01:45:31.600 --> 01:45:32.640]   to all these different sites,
[01:45:32.640 --> 01:45:35.200]   they can then compare them and do cross-site tracking.
[01:45:35.200 --> 01:45:37.200]   And they're like, so we just decided to anonymize it
[01:45:37.200 --> 01:45:38.200]   and just generate it in time.
[01:45:38.200 --> 01:45:39.040]   - Yeah, baby.
[01:45:39.040 --> 01:45:40.040]   - Made our own thing, right?
[01:45:40.040 --> 01:45:41.360]   - Yeah, baby.
[01:45:41.360 --> 01:45:43.920]   - This is typical Apple, where they're just like,
[01:45:43.920 --> 01:45:45.760]   that was great, but we took it a step further,
[01:45:45.760 --> 01:45:46.760]   and it's like, this is not a thing
[01:45:46.760 --> 01:45:48.560]   they're ever gonna talk about in the keynote, right?
[01:45:48.560 --> 01:45:50.360]   But when you start diving into these sessions,
[01:45:50.360 --> 01:45:53.080]   you realize how much time and thought they've put each
[01:45:53.080 --> 01:45:54.200]   of these processes. - I wanna see more, yeah.
[01:45:54.200 --> 01:45:55.080]   I wanna see this.
[01:45:55.080 --> 01:45:58.440]   I like, you know, everybody who watches our shows,
[01:45:58.440 --> 01:46:00.760]   likes getting under the hood, and really,
[01:46:00.760 --> 01:46:02.040]   under, here's the picture that guy
[01:46:02.040 --> 01:46:04.960]   finding his using UWB, finding his.
[01:46:04.960 --> 01:46:05.800]   (laughing)
[01:46:05.800 --> 01:46:06.640]   - Yep.
[01:46:06.640 --> 01:46:07.640]   - You found it.
[01:46:07.640 --> 01:46:08.480]   - Found it.
[01:46:08.480 --> 01:46:10.120]   - There's over here, yeah, I found it.
[01:46:10.120 --> 01:46:12.640]   - Jason, were there any that stood out in your room?
[01:46:12.640 --> 01:46:15.720]   - Yeah, talking about attestation.
[01:46:15.720 --> 01:46:18.480]   If you wanna see the links that Apple will go to,
[01:46:18.480 --> 01:46:21.160]   to build a feature, and it could sort of,
[01:46:21.160 --> 01:46:24.160]   because it's the car key presentation, which is--
[01:46:24.160 --> 01:46:26.440]   - You said, this is gonna be,
[01:46:26.440 --> 01:46:28.920]   this is gonna change the world, isn't it?
[01:46:28.920 --> 01:46:31.560]   - Yeah, well, I mean, it's gonna involve new cars
[01:46:31.560 --> 01:46:32.760]   and new phones, so it's gonna take
[01:46:32.760 --> 01:46:34.920]   for a lot of people five or 10 years for it to happen.
[01:46:34.920 --> 01:46:38.000]   But in the near term, it's NFC, so like Apple Pay,
[01:46:38.000 --> 01:46:39.800]   but in the long term, it's ultra wideband,
[01:46:39.800 --> 01:46:42.360]   and Apple is in this car consortium,
[01:46:42.360 --> 01:46:45.720]   and ultra wideband is this U1 chip in the iPhone.
[01:46:45.720 --> 01:46:49.480]   It lets you know exactly where you are in space,
[01:46:49.480 --> 01:46:53.120]   and as a result, it's gonna be fairly easy
[01:46:53.120 --> 01:46:54.640]   to just walk out to your car,
[01:46:54.640 --> 01:46:57.640]   it knows you're at the door, it unlocks the door you get in,
[01:46:57.640 --> 01:46:58.800]   and it knows you're in the car,
[01:46:58.800 --> 01:47:00.600]   and then you press start, and you go.
[01:47:00.600 --> 01:47:01.960]   That is how cars are gonna work,
[01:47:01.960 --> 01:47:03.080]   we're gonna use our phones.
[01:47:03.080 --> 01:47:06.400]   But then if you watch that session, you see,
[01:47:06.400 --> 01:47:09.560]   like there are invisible messages being sent
[01:47:09.560 --> 01:47:11.840]   behind the scenes that you send one message
[01:47:11.840 --> 01:47:12.800]   that you can see that's like,
[01:47:12.800 --> 01:47:14.680]   I'm sharing my key with a friend,
[01:47:14.680 --> 01:47:17.440]   and then like it kicks off this whole chain reaction,
[01:47:17.440 --> 01:47:20.280]   there are attestations that happen between the servers
[01:47:20.280 --> 01:47:22.120]   saying, yes, that is my friend,
[01:47:22.120 --> 01:47:26.560]   and it is a remarkable session that's geared toward car makers,
[01:47:26.560 --> 01:47:29.400]   which is, it's a German man speaking to car makers,
[01:47:29.400 --> 01:47:32.920]   but behind the scenes, some of those charts are like,
[01:47:32.920 --> 01:47:36.200]   it is, there's so much cryptographic complexity going on
[01:47:36.200 --> 01:47:38.400]   because they wanna make sure that they build this
[01:47:38.400 --> 01:47:42.800]   so that your car key is not hacked, basically,
[01:47:42.800 --> 01:47:45.400]   and so they go through incredible lengths to do that.
[01:47:45.400 --> 01:47:47.240]   I was very impressed, and then the other session
[01:47:47.240 --> 01:47:49.360]   I'd mentioned is designed for the iOS pointer,
[01:47:49.360 --> 01:47:50.560]   all these sessions are on the web,
[01:47:50.560 --> 01:47:52.360]   you can just go to Apple site and you can view them.
[01:47:52.360 --> 01:47:54.480]   It's such, if you care about design
[01:47:54.480 --> 01:47:58.040]   or like computer interaction design at all,
[01:47:58.040 --> 01:47:59.320]   it's just an amazing session
[01:47:59.320 --> 01:48:02.200]   because it really is the designers who thought up
[01:48:02.200 --> 01:48:04.680]   how to do a pointer on iPad,
[01:48:04.680 --> 01:48:08.400]   talking about like the philosophy of what pointers
[01:48:08.400 --> 01:48:11.040]   on computer interfaces mean and how they work
[01:48:11.040 --> 01:48:13.080]   and what's good and what's bad about them,
[01:48:13.080 --> 01:48:14.960]   and it's just, it's so smart,
[01:48:14.960 --> 01:48:17.600]   and it will make you think about something you took
[01:48:17.600 --> 01:48:19.760]   for granted with a lot more detail.
[01:48:19.760 --> 01:48:21.600]   So that's the one that I like the most.
[01:48:21.600 --> 01:48:24.120]   >> If you love technology, this is heaven.
[01:48:24.120 --> 01:48:26.160]   Laurie, did you watch some of the tracks?
[01:48:26.160 --> 01:48:29.120]   >> I've been able to get through a few of them,
[01:48:29.120 --> 01:48:30.360]   but not very many at all,
[01:48:30.360 --> 01:48:32.400]   but I did really like the app clips,
[01:48:32.400 --> 01:48:35.280]   the designing for app clips in part because
[01:48:35.280 --> 01:48:38.600]   it gives us a window into what to expect,
[01:48:38.600 --> 01:48:41.480]   what this, because it seems a little like,
[01:48:41.480 --> 01:48:44.600]   I don't get it, I can use an app without having to use an app,
[01:48:44.600 --> 01:48:45.440]   that doesn't make sense.
[01:48:45.440 --> 01:48:48.880]   So watching this session kind of gave me a better idea
[01:48:48.880 --> 01:48:51.640]   of like what that means, what an app like actually does.
[01:48:51.640 --> 01:48:54.200]   So, you know, some of that stuff, Leo,
[01:48:54.200 --> 01:48:58.720]   I think you could like find a title that you like,
[01:48:58.720 --> 01:49:00.440]   and you don't have to watch the whole thing,
[01:49:00.440 --> 01:49:02.200]   because sometimes you want,
[01:49:02.200 --> 01:49:04.520]   you just want to get like the consumer version
[01:49:04.520 --> 01:49:07.360]   of the information so you can like fast forwards
[01:49:07.360 --> 01:49:09.040]   through some of the coding stuff,
[01:49:09.040 --> 01:49:12.080]   and then you know, get a better idea
[01:49:12.080 --> 01:49:17.080]   of a 30 or 40 minute session in 10 or 15 minutes, you know?
[01:49:17.080 --> 01:49:19.560]   >> I'm trying, you know, I haven't written software
[01:49:19.560 --> 01:49:23.360]   for the Mac since the Macintosh programmers were shop,
[01:49:23.360 --> 01:49:26.280]   and the, you know, the inside Macintosh,
[01:49:26.280 --> 01:49:30.160]   by the way, I sadly lost years ago in the move somewhere
[01:49:30.160 --> 01:49:33.200]   through away or just, you know, gave away my app,
[01:49:33.200 --> 01:49:35.200]   my inside Macintosh three volumes,
[01:49:35.200 --> 01:49:37.120]   and I was so inspired by this,
[01:49:37.120 --> 01:49:40.720]   I literally went on eBay and ordered some used, you know,
[01:49:40.720 --> 01:49:42.800]   it's only 50 bucks for all three volumes,
[01:49:42.800 --> 01:49:46.760]   'cause I want it, that was a miracle for me to read that,
[01:49:46.760 --> 01:49:48.320]   it was so beautifully specced out,
[01:49:48.320 --> 01:49:50.320]   it was all in the ROM on the Macintosh,
[01:49:50.320 --> 01:49:52.360]   and it made software development so much easier,
[01:49:52.360 --> 01:49:55.400]   so I haven't played with it, I mean, since past gallon,
[01:49:55.400 --> 01:49:59.520]   68,000 assembly, 'cause honestly in my heart,
[01:49:59.520 --> 01:50:02.640]   I wanna do hardware independent stuff,
[01:50:02.640 --> 01:50:05.200]   I wanna do, and which means mostly command line,
[01:50:05.200 --> 01:50:06.760]   'cause gooeys tend to be dependent,
[01:50:06.760 --> 01:50:09.480]   but that's for me the fun part of programming,
[01:50:09.480 --> 01:50:12.440]   but having dipped, and I would recommend
[01:50:12.440 --> 01:50:16.360]   Big Nerd Ranch has a really good book on iOS development,
[01:50:16.360 --> 01:50:18.520]   they always do there on their seventh edition now,
[01:50:18.520 --> 01:50:21.640]   so I picked that up, and to me watching these
[01:50:21.640 --> 01:50:23.640]   is really inspiring and fun,
[01:50:23.640 --> 01:50:26.720]   but it is a complex, deep ecosystem,
[01:50:26.720 --> 01:50:32.080]   and this has evolved considerably over the years,
[01:50:32.080 --> 01:50:35.480]   I think they've cleaned it up, I think SwiftUI is really nice,
[01:50:35.480 --> 01:50:39.320]   I think the Xcode is pretty remarkable,
[01:50:39.320 --> 01:50:43.040]   and I think if you're a developer and you wanted,
[01:50:43.040 --> 01:50:45.880]   to me now, hardware dependent design is not so bad,
[01:50:45.880 --> 01:50:48.440]   if I get on an iPhone and iPad and a Mac,
[01:50:48.440 --> 01:50:50.760]   that's not a bad ecosystem to be in,
[01:50:50.760 --> 01:50:54.600]   so to me it's exciting, I'm very intrigued.
[01:50:54.600 --> 01:50:56.600]   I wanna do a speed round with you guys,
[01:50:56.600 --> 01:51:00.360]   'cause the show's almost two hours long already,
[01:51:00.360 --> 01:51:02.200]   and we haven't even gotten iOS,
[01:51:02.200 --> 01:51:07.040]   and iPadOS, and we haven't gotten to the watch,
[01:51:07.040 --> 01:51:09.520]   let alone all the other stories in the tech world,
[01:51:09.520 --> 01:51:11.160]   and I wanna get as many of these as we can,
[01:51:11.160 --> 01:51:13.040]   let me take a break, give you a chance,
[01:51:13.040 --> 01:51:14.400]   we'll do a quick speed round,
[01:51:14.400 --> 01:51:19.040]   just features that you're excited about in iOS,
[01:51:19.040 --> 01:51:22.240]   and watch iOS, I don't know if there's anything in TVOS,
[01:51:22.240 --> 01:51:24.440]   some of the new stuff that's coming down the pike.
[01:51:24.440 --> 01:51:26.200]   Laurie Gill is here from iMore,
[01:51:26.200 --> 01:51:29.120]   she's managing editor at iMore.com,
[01:51:29.120 --> 01:51:32.400]   Dan Morin from Six Colors, it's inconceivable,
[01:51:32.400 --> 01:51:36.000]   the inconceivable podcast, and many other great shows,
[01:51:36.000 --> 01:51:39.000]   and of course, my good buddy, Jason Snell,
[01:51:39.000 --> 01:51:41.640]   the incomparable Jason Snell,
[01:51:41.640 --> 01:51:44.760]   also from the founder of Six Colors.
[01:51:44.760 --> 01:51:47.720]   You're doing well at Six Colors, I'm very pleased.
[01:51:47.720 --> 01:51:48.560]   - We're keeping busy.
[01:51:48.560 --> 01:51:50.400]   - That's a scary jump that you made,
[01:51:50.400 --> 01:51:52.920]   but you guys did a great job, right?
[01:51:52.920 --> 01:51:57.040]   - It's been almost six years now, five and a half years.
[01:51:57.040 --> 01:52:01.280]   - Yeah, yeah, so many have come and gone in that time,
[01:52:01.280 --> 01:52:03.880]   and I know that when you both were making that jump
[01:52:03.880 --> 01:52:08.720]   from Macworld and looking at the life ahead as an indie,
[01:52:08.720 --> 01:52:10.600]   that must have been very, very scary,
[01:52:10.600 --> 01:52:12.960]   but having also made that jump,
[01:52:12.960 --> 01:52:14.800]   I think it was a good jump, right?
[01:52:14.800 --> 01:52:16.560]   - Yeah, I don't regret it, Dan.
[01:52:16.560 --> 01:52:17.640]   - Same. - No.
[01:52:17.640 --> 01:52:20.240]   - It's been a huge improvement to my life.
[01:52:20.240 --> 01:52:22.840]   - Yeah, it's a lot better than working for a big company.
[01:52:22.840 --> 01:52:24.080]   (laughs)
[01:52:24.080 --> 01:52:25.400]   - No fun.
[01:52:25.400 --> 01:52:26.720]   No fun at all. - Sure.
[01:52:26.720 --> 01:52:28.800]   (laughs)
[01:52:28.800 --> 01:52:31.720]   - Our show today, we'll do a quick ad
[01:52:31.720 --> 01:52:33.480]   and we'll get to the speed round.
[01:52:33.480 --> 01:52:36.240]   Zendesk is a new sponsor, I'm really excited.
[01:52:36.240 --> 01:52:38.680]   I'm thrilled, I've been using and knowing about Zendesk
[01:52:38.680 --> 01:52:42.120]   for years, it's a service first customer
[01:52:42.120 --> 01:52:44.760]   relationship management CRM company
[01:52:44.760 --> 01:52:47.240]   that builds software that is designed
[01:52:47.240 --> 01:52:50.240]   to improve customer relationships.
[01:52:50.240 --> 01:52:53.920]   Most of the time in life, we're customers, that's our job.
[01:52:53.920 --> 01:52:56.800]   And we want a company, we wanna work with companies
[01:52:56.800 --> 01:52:59.120]   that know how to treat us.
[01:52:59.120 --> 01:53:01.560]   And the companies that I invariably say,
[01:53:01.560 --> 01:53:05.800]   gosh, they're doing it right, they're using Zendesk.
[01:53:05.800 --> 01:53:08.440]   This is a tough time right now for every company,
[01:53:08.440 --> 01:53:09.920]   things are a little weird,
[01:53:09.920 --> 01:53:12.480]   makes it hard to keep up with what matters most,
[01:53:12.480 --> 01:53:16.760]   but every company should know that it's customers first,
[01:53:16.760 --> 01:53:19.240]   right, and Zendesk is there to help there.
[01:53:19.240 --> 01:53:21.560]   Right now, this couldn't be a better time
[01:53:21.560 --> 01:53:23.240]   'cause they're offering a six month
[01:53:23.240 --> 01:53:26.680]   absolutely complimentary remote support bundle.
[01:53:26.680 --> 01:53:28.920]   You can use this for six months for free.
[01:53:28.920 --> 01:53:31.200]   It comes with the essential tools your team needs
[01:53:31.200 --> 01:53:34.020]   to stay agile, to keep connected with customers,
[01:53:34.020 --> 01:53:37.280]   whether it's by email, phone, chat, community forum,
[01:53:37.280 --> 01:53:39.960]   help center, social media, they do it all.
[01:53:39.960 --> 01:53:44.040]   It takes hours, not weeks to get up and running,
[01:53:44.040 --> 01:53:46.440]   you'll be using it tomorrow.
[01:53:46.440 --> 01:53:48.640]   And I have to tell you, customer,
[01:53:48.640 --> 01:53:51.360]   I was talking about this with Lisa yesterday,
[01:53:51.360 --> 01:53:53.400]   something about COVID, customer service,
[01:53:53.400 --> 01:53:54.720]   and I was talking about it on the radio too,
[01:53:54.720 --> 01:53:55.960]   has gone downhill.
[01:53:55.960 --> 01:53:58.560]   Here's your chance to shine,
[01:53:58.560 --> 01:54:00.960]   to impress your customers, to say,
[01:54:00.960 --> 01:54:04.000]   no, it's gonna be better now,
[01:54:04.000 --> 01:54:05.320]   it's gonna be better now,
[01:54:05.320 --> 01:54:07.400]   'cause customers need you right now.
[01:54:07.400 --> 01:54:09.000]   Zendesk was built on a simple idea,
[01:54:09.000 --> 01:54:10.920]   make customer service software,
[01:54:10.920 --> 01:54:12.640]   that's very easy to use,
[01:54:12.640 --> 01:54:14.480]   that's accessible to anyone
[01:54:14.480 --> 01:54:17.320]   with a single dynamic help desk interface.
[01:54:17.320 --> 01:54:19.280]   You can implement it easily and quickly,
[01:54:19.280 --> 01:54:21.240]   it's very flexible, of course,
[01:54:21.240 --> 01:54:23.680]   so it can match not only what you're doing today,
[01:54:23.680 --> 01:54:25.440]   but what you'll be doing tomorrow.
[01:54:25.440 --> 01:54:27.900]   And it works right out of the box,
[01:54:27.900 --> 01:54:30.640]   so you get a instant experience,
[01:54:30.640 --> 01:54:32.740]   but then you can configure it to your preferences,
[01:54:32.740 --> 01:54:35.200]   you can add integration, other apps,
[01:54:35.200 --> 01:54:37.240]   to make it, you know, build it to suit.
[01:54:37.240 --> 01:54:38.600]   That's why it's used by everybody,
[01:54:38.600 --> 01:54:40.880]   from startups to large enterprises,
[01:54:40.880 --> 01:54:43.560]   it can grow as you grow,
[01:54:43.560 --> 01:54:46.400]   with powerful, innovative customer experiences
[01:54:46.400 --> 01:54:48.440]   that puts them within reach of every company,
[01:54:48.440 --> 01:54:51.000]   no matter the size, the industry, the ambition.
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:52.800]   I think Zendesk is a must-have,
[01:54:52.800 --> 01:54:54.720]   and the companies that I work with,
[01:54:54.720 --> 01:54:55.480]   look at these companies,
[01:54:55.480 --> 01:54:58.160]   these are the companies who are famous
[01:54:58.160 --> 01:55:00.200]   for their customer service.
[01:55:00.200 --> 01:55:01.960]   The director of client-facing experience
[01:55:01.960 --> 01:55:04.160]   and analytics at Homebridge, Ben Chapman,
[01:55:04.160 --> 01:55:05.200]   here's a quote, he says,
[01:55:05.200 --> 01:55:07.880]   "Having all the customer data in a single place
[01:55:07.880 --> 01:55:09.360]   helps us to achieve a high
[01:55:09.360 --> 01:55:12.160]   and consistent level of customer satisfaction.
[01:55:12.160 --> 01:55:13.680]   We can collaborate better,
[01:55:13.680 --> 01:55:16.360]   we have the visibility to see and report on everything.
[01:55:16.360 --> 01:55:20.240]   Zendesk also, this is not to be minimized,
[01:55:20.240 --> 01:55:23.160]   also improves security by allowing us
[01:55:23.160 --> 01:55:25.560]   to control access to sensitive content."
[01:55:25.560 --> 01:55:27.560]   Isn't that nice to know they also are caring
[01:55:27.560 --> 01:55:28.960]   about your data protection?
[01:55:28.960 --> 01:55:31.120]   Zendesk works nearly everywhere.
[01:55:31.120 --> 01:55:34.120]   They have 150,000 customers across hundreds of industries,
[01:55:34.120 --> 01:55:36.120]   30 languages.
[01:55:36.120 --> 01:55:38.600]   Look, the customer journey differs for everybody,
[01:55:38.600 --> 01:55:40.720]   but no matter what your business need,
[01:55:40.720 --> 01:55:42.120]   you need Zendesk.
[01:55:42.120 --> 01:55:45.160]   It's flexible enough to pave the path that's best
[01:55:45.160 --> 01:55:46.560]   for your organization,
[01:55:46.560 --> 01:55:49.720]   and now there couldn't be a better time to do it.
[01:55:49.720 --> 01:55:52.600]   Six months free, the remote support bundle,
[01:55:52.600 --> 01:55:57.200]   just in time, zendesk.com/twitszen,
[01:55:57.200 --> 01:55:59.480]   'cause that's how you'll feel when you start using it.
[01:55:59.480 --> 01:56:04.480]   (sighs) zendesk.com/twits.
[01:56:04.480 --> 01:56:08.760]   I wish every company would start using Zendesk.
[01:56:08.760 --> 01:56:10.200]   We were talking, we were talking about,
[01:56:10.200 --> 01:56:12.000]   oh, I won't mention it.
[01:56:12.000 --> 01:56:14.040]   Former sponsor guy called on the radio show,
[01:56:14.040 --> 01:56:15.960]   he says, "I can't reach anybody."
[01:56:15.960 --> 01:56:17.880]   I said, "It's weird, it's like COVID.
[01:56:17.880 --> 01:56:21.000]   "Everybody's brains have drained out slowly,
[01:56:21.000 --> 01:56:26.000]   "and everybody's just gonna, hi, customer service."
[01:56:26.000 --> 01:56:28.920]   And I have to, I'm not actually doing this on the air,
[01:56:28.920 --> 01:56:32.640]   we apologize, 'cause we had a company doing our,
[01:56:32.640 --> 01:56:34.360]   no, this isn't a zendesk, this is after,
[01:56:34.360 --> 01:56:35.560]   this is non-zendesk.
[01:56:35.560 --> 01:56:37.880]   We had, I wish they had been using Zendesk.
[01:56:37.880 --> 01:56:41.120]   We had a company doing our merch, t-shirts,
[01:56:41.120 --> 01:56:43.840]   and stuff, masks, we had these beautiful masks,
[01:56:43.840 --> 01:56:45.520]   and they just went off the face of the earth,
[01:56:45.520 --> 01:56:48.000]   they just disappeared, they stopped responding to calls,
[01:56:48.000 --> 01:56:50.520]   requests, and I really apologize.
[01:56:50.520 --> 01:56:53.760]   If you ordered a mask and it was misdelivered
[01:56:53.760 --> 01:56:56.160]   or you didn't get it, please contact us.
[01:56:56.160 --> 01:56:59.040]   Send an email to Jerry, he's our marketing guy,
[01:56:59.040 --> 01:57:02.160]   Jerry@twit.tv, we will make it good,
[01:57:02.160 --> 01:57:05.320]   even if we can't get the company to make it good,
[01:57:05.320 --> 01:57:07.420]   I will personally write you a check,
[01:57:07.420 --> 01:57:10.000]   we will make it good, 'cause I don't want anybody to be--
[01:57:10.000 --> 01:57:12.200]   - You should personally make them a mask.
[01:57:12.200 --> 01:57:14.280]   - I will make you a mask if you want.
[01:57:14.280 --> 01:57:16.920]   Actually, the masks they made were great, we did get some,
[01:57:16.920 --> 01:57:19.320]   but I don't know, there's something went on,
[01:57:19.320 --> 01:57:22.000]   it's like the company, honestly, I think it's COVID,
[01:57:22.000 --> 01:57:24.740]   I know it's COVID, the production facility shut down,
[01:57:24.740 --> 01:57:28.060]   the customer service died, the whole thing just collapsed,
[01:57:28.060 --> 01:57:29.860]   and I'm sure they'll come back after COVID.
[01:57:29.860 --> 01:57:32.580]   We have switched, we're with another company,
[01:57:32.580 --> 01:57:35.100]   they're very good now, and we have masks again,
[01:57:35.100 --> 01:57:37.180]   and they're being delivered properly and all that,
[01:57:37.180 --> 01:57:38.940]   but if you had ordered with us earlier,
[01:57:38.940 --> 01:57:43.580]   and if any time you have any issues with a Twit merch,
[01:57:43.580 --> 01:57:45.500]   we don't do it, we always go through a third party,
[01:57:45.500 --> 01:57:48.780]   but we will make it good, I don't want anybody to suffer.
[01:57:48.780 --> 01:57:50.820]   We don't make money on the stuff, we just do it,
[01:57:50.820 --> 01:57:53.900]   because it's nice if you wear a Twit thing once in a while.
[01:57:53.900 --> 01:57:55.540]   These are the new masks, by the way.
[01:57:55.540 --> 01:57:59.380]   If you want Steve Gibson on a mask,
[01:57:59.380 --> 01:58:02.780]   or a bandana, I like that too, here's your chance.
[01:58:02.780 --> 01:58:07.380]   It's just twit.tv/store, and this is a new company,
[01:58:07.380 --> 01:58:11.180]   so this guy is working, but I apologize for anybody who got,
[01:58:11.180 --> 01:58:15.460]   I just took for a whomever, I don't know what was going on,
[01:58:15.460 --> 01:58:17.100]   I really don't, it's very weird.
[01:58:17.100 --> 01:58:21.580]   They should've used Zendesk, clearly, it's going to be weird.
[01:58:22.500 --> 01:58:24.580]   All right, speed round, I'll start,
[01:58:24.580 --> 01:58:28.540]   'cause I, there's a feature, it's an accessibility feature,
[01:58:28.540 --> 01:58:31.580]   so it's often the case, Apple hides some of the best features
[01:58:31.580 --> 01:58:34.860]   under accessibility, it's the double and the triple tap.
[01:58:34.860 --> 01:58:37.220]   That is the coolest thing on the iPhone,
[01:58:37.220 --> 01:58:39.260]   you can assign it to different tasks,
[01:58:39.260 --> 01:58:41.500]   I presume at some point I'll be able to do Apple shortcuts
[01:58:41.500 --> 01:58:43.020]   with it, I think I can. - You can.
[01:58:43.020 --> 01:58:45.300]   - So that means I can do anything.
[01:58:45.300 --> 01:58:47.260]   - Yeah. - That's freaking awesome.
[01:58:47.260 --> 01:58:51.860]   - I was thinking about how when the protests
[01:58:51.860 --> 01:58:55.340]   started happening and I believe it was Matthew Kessinelli
[01:58:55.340 --> 01:58:59.340]   who made it a short cut that allows you to ask Siri
[01:58:59.340 --> 01:59:02.300]   to open up your camera, film something,
[01:59:02.300 --> 01:59:04.580]   and then share that with friends
[01:59:04.580 --> 01:59:07.500]   or put it in a cloud storage.
[01:59:07.500 --> 01:59:09.980]   What if you didn't even have to say something,
[01:59:09.980 --> 01:59:12.380]   what if you could just double tap your phone
[01:59:12.380 --> 01:59:14.580]   and that exact same shortcut could pop up,
[01:59:14.580 --> 01:59:16.380]   you could suddenly do it, yeah.
[01:59:16.380 --> 01:59:18.540]   - What are you excited about, Laurie Gill?
[01:59:18.540 --> 01:59:20.940]   - There's so much.
[01:59:20.940 --> 01:59:22.660]   - You can do it for you, don't limit it.
[01:59:22.660 --> 01:59:23.700]   - It's hard to unpack them all.
[01:59:23.700 --> 01:59:27.220]   So I actually found out how much I really do love being able
[01:59:27.220 --> 01:59:28.900]   to customize my home screen.
[01:59:28.900 --> 01:59:30.300]   I didn't think I cared. - Yes.
[01:59:30.300 --> 01:59:33.820]   - And now that I can, I think I've told you,
[01:59:33.820 --> 01:59:37.060]   I have a dozen folders with all of my apps
[01:59:37.060 --> 01:59:38.300]   all properly organized.
[01:59:38.300 --> 01:59:41.020]   So I didn't think I was gonna really like this that much.
[01:59:41.020 --> 01:59:43.620]   Turns out I love it, I love being able to have,
[01:59:43.620 --> 01:59:47.260]   I have, my home screen has almost nothing but the widgets
[01:59:47.260 --> 01:59:50.380]   on it because I can and it's just neat
[01:59:50.380 --> 01:59:52.780]   to be able to have that stuff being interactive.
[01:59:52.780 --> 01:59:56.220]   And the fact that you can hide home pages
[01:59:56.220 --> 01:59:59.940]   so I can create an entire homepage that's nothing but
[01:59:59.940 --> 02:00:03.700]   work apps and then hide it at five o'clock or whatever.
[02:00:03.700 --> 02:00:06.060]   Like I love that idea.
[02:00:06.060 --> 02:00:08.700]   - It's the first time Springboard's been updated
[02:00:08.700 --> 02:00:11.740]   for years, but finally, and it's, you know,
[02:00:11.740 --> 02:00:13.700]   people are gonna say, well, the Android's been doing that.
[02:00:13.700 --> 02:00:15.420]   But I think they do it a little bit more elegantly,
[02:00:15.420 --> 02:00:16.580]   frankly than Android.
[02:00:16.580 --> 02:00:18.860]   But we'll say, yeah, I agree with you.
[02:00:18.860 --> 02:00:20.340]   That's a very nice feature.
[02:00:20.340 --> 02:00:21.340]   It's a big one.
[02:00:21.340 --> 02:00:22.180]   - Yeah.
[02:00:22.180 --> 02:00:23.340]   - There's little ones too.
[02:00:23.340 --> 02:00:27.100]   Let me see if I can, speaking of accessibility,
[02:00:27.100 --> 02:00:29.380]   this to me is absolutely incredible
[02:00:29.380 --> 02:00:31.940]   that this is even technology that's possible.
[02:00:31.940 --> 02:00:34.060]   So when you have a group face time,
[02:00:34.060 --> 02:00:37.460]   the person talking their bubble becomes larger
[02:00:37.460 --> 02:00:39.740]   to let you know that, you know,
[02:00:39.740 --> 02:00:41.660]   the speaking person is highlighted.
[02:00:41.660 --> 02:00:42.500]   - Simple.
[02:00:42.500 --> 02:00:45.660]   - So in iOS 14 and iPadOS 14,
[02:00:45.660 --> 02:00:48.940]   your, the person speaking sign language
[02:00:48.940 --> 02:00:50.900]   will actually become the larger bubble.
[02:00:50.900 --> 02:00:52.540]   It recognizes sign language
[02:00:52.540 --> 02:00:54.940]   and then emphasizes that person's bubble.
[02:00:54.940 --> 02:00:56.580]   How incredible is that?
[02:00:56.580 --> 02:00:57.860]   How impressive is that?
[02:00:57.860 --> 02:00:59.740]   So even if you're in a group where some people
[02:00:59.740 --> 02:01:01.140]   are speaking with their mouths
[02:01:01.140 --> 02:01:02.700]   and other people are speaking with their hands,
[02:01:02.700 --> 02:01:05.220]   it recognizes that and gives that person
[02:01:05.220 --> 02:01:06.500]   the spotlight of the bubble.
[02:01:06.500 --> 02:01:07.780]   - Wow. - So that's really cool.
[02:01:07.780 --> 02:01:09.300]   - Very cool.
[02:01:09.300 --> 02:01:11.580]   Jason Snell, is there anything you're excited about,
[02:01:11.580 --> 02:01:16.100]   in iOS 14 or what is it, watch a seven?
[02:01:16.100 --> 02:01:17.180]   - Yeah.
[02:01:17.180 --> 02:01:19.020]   - A couple of years ago, we went on a road trip
[02:01:19.020 --> 02:01:20.700]   and we were in downtown Salt Lake City
[02:01:20.700 --> 02:01:24.460]   and all of the parking meters there are app-based.
[02:01:24.460 --> 02:01:26.380]   And I spent like a good five or 10 minutes
[02:01:26.380 --> 02:01:29.100]   downloading an app and entering in my credit card
[02:01:29.100 --> 02:01:31.340]   information while holding my phone in my credit card
[02:01:31.340 --> 02:01:32.180]   and all of that.
[02:01:32.180 --> 02:01:35.340]   And then in order to get to pay to park.
[02:01:35.340 --> 02:01:37.340]   And Apple is doing this thing called app clips,
[02:01:37.340 --> 02:01:40.380]   which is kind of like the slices idea that Android has tried
[02:01:40.380 --> 02:01:41.940]   and it really hasn't gone anywhere.
[02:01:41.940 --> 02:01:44.140]   But you know, Apple has proven that they're really good
[02:01:44.140 --> 02:01:45.300]   at popularizing stuff.
[02:01:45.300 --> 02:01:49.860]   So this may work, the idea is you scan a barcode or an NFC code
[02:01:49.860 --> 02:01:51.980]   or actually you can even tap on items and maps
[02:01:51.980 --> 02:01:53.220]   or scan something on a table.
[02:01:53.220 --> 02:01:54.420]   There are like lots of ways to do it.
[02:01:54.420 --> 02:01:58.300]   And it automatically downloads a little mini app
[02:01:58.300 --> 02:02:00.660]   from the app store and launches it.
[02:02:00.660 --> 02:02:04.340]   And so for example, with that parking meter,
[02:02:04.340 --> 02:02:07.020]   if the parking meter has an app clip,
[02:02:07.020 --> 02:02:08.540]   which is what these things are called,
[02:02:08.540 --> 02:02:11.060]   if they support signing with Apple
[02:02:11.060 --> 02:02:12.540]   and they support Apple Pay,
[02:02:12.540 --> 02:02:16.060]   I could literally go boop, tap my phone to the parking meter
[02:02:16.060 --> 02:02:18.860]   and go sign in with Apple, Apple Pay, done.
[02:02:18.860 --> 02:02:20.260]   And I paid for parking.
[02:02:20.260 --> 02:02:21.700]   Without ever going to the app store,
[02:02:21.700 --> 02:02:23.980]   without ever entering anything in, that's the dream.
[02:02:23.980 --> 02:02:25.100]   We'll see how it happens.
[02:02:25.100 --> 02:02:27.980]   The other way they described it is you can use it for Apple Maps
[02:02:27.980 --> 02:02:30.220]   to like order an advance before you get there.
[02:02:30.220 --> 02:02:32.380]   And we just open an app clip and let you say,
[02:02:32.380 --> 02:02:35.780]   yeah, I want a muffin and a coffee and you could go.
[02:02:35.780 --> 02:02:38.340]   You could even do it if you wanted to embrace
[02:02:38.340 --> 02:02:40.900]   the app clip lifestyle, like put different codes
[02:02:40.900 --> 02:02:42.940]   on different tables in your restaurant.
[02:02:42.940 --> 02:02:44.300]   And so then you wouldn't even need to say
[02:02:44.300 --> 02:02:45.580]   like where you were or who you were.
[02:02:45.580 --> 02:02:47.740]   You literally just scan it and say what you want.
[02:02:47.740 --> 02:02:49.260]   And they know what table you're at
[02:02:49.260 --> 02:02:51.260]   because it was embedded in the QR code
[02:02:51.260 --> 02:02:53.740]   or the NFC code that you scan.
[02:02:53.740 --> 02:02:56.060]   - Living La Vida app clips.
[02:02:56.060 --> 02:02:58.100]   - So it might-- - And there's,
[02:02:58.100 --> 02:02:59.940]   there's even customizable app clips.
[02:02:59.940 --> 02:03:02.900]   So you can have one restaurant, let's say,
[02:03:02.900 --> 02:03:04.380]   that has a restaurant app clip,
[02:03:04.380 --> 02:03:07.180]   but also has the wine and beer app clip.
[02:03:07.180 --> 02:03:08.020]   - Right.
[02:03:08.020 --> 02:03:09.060]   And it goes the other way too,
[02:03:09.060 --> 02:03:11.220]   where if you're like somebody like Yelp,
[02:03:11.220 --> 02:03:13.260]   instead of it being a Yelp app clip,
[02:03:13.260 --> 02:03:15.580]   when you scan it at a particular restaurant
[02:03:15.580 --> 02:03:19.060]   that's using Yelp, it'll show up as that restaurant
[02:03:19.060 --> 02:03:20.060]   powered by Yelp. - Right.
[02:03:20.060 --> 02:03:22.340]   - But they get their branding and all of that in there too,
[02:03:22.340 --> 02:03:24.780]   which I think it's very clearly Apple talked
[02:03:24.780 --> 02:03:27.140]   to a lot of different potential stakeholders
[02:03:27.140 --> 02:03:30.380]   about how to implement this and they did a smart job of it.
[02:03:30.380 --> 02:03:32.660]   - So why didn't Android slices,
[02:03:32.660 --> 02:03:33.900]   which are essentially the same thing,
[02:03:33.900 --> 02:03:36.940]   small bits of the app that load as you need them?
[02:03:36.940 --> 02:03:38.980]   Why didn't that take off?
[02:03:38.980 --> 02:03:40.820]   - You would know better than me.
[02:03:40.820 --> 02:03:43.180]   I would just say that Apple tends to be really good
[02:03:43.180 --> 02:03:45.820]   at marketing and both to the general public
[02:03:45.820 --> 02:03:48.660]   and to businesses and to its developer base.
[02:03:48.660 --> 02:03:50.940]   And therefore this has got to be a better chance
[02:03:50.940 --> 02:03:52.540]   of working than the phones--
[02:03:52.540 --> 02:03:54.620]   - There's always the risk that people won't support it,
[02:03:54.620 --> 02:03:57.020]   but I have to say it's very easy.
[02:03:57.020 --> 02:04:00.100]   I did play with writing one and it's not hard at all.
[02:04:00.100 --> 02:04:02.580]   And it's only, you know, it's limited to 10 megabytes,
[02:04:02.580 --> 02:04:04.620]   but the fundamental functionality.
[02:04:04.620 --> 02:04:06.420]   And you know, one of the things that makes this work
[02:04:06.420 --> 02:04:10.340]   that perhaps Android didn't have down so much, Apple Pay.
[02:04:10.340 --> 02:04:13.180]   - Yeah, if you can put all of those things together,
[02:04:13.180 --> 02:04:14.820]   it's pretty compelling, right?
[02:04:14.820 --> 02:04:16.660]   And what do they get out of it?
[02:04:16.660 --> 02:04:17.820]   They get money.
[02:04:17.820 --> 02:04:20.420]   - Yeah, Apple gets 30% nice deal Apple.
[02:04:20.420 --> 02:04:23.540]   - Yeah, and the parking meter gets people to pay easily
[02:04:23.540 --> 02:04:24.540]   and not get frustrated.
[02:04:24.540 --> 02:04:26.140]   And I think that's probably good too.
[02:04:26.140 --> 02:04:28.660]   The other one I'll mention really quick is shortcuts.
[02:04:28.660 --> 02:04:32.620]   We mentioned that that new back tap feature
[02:04:32.620 --> 02:04:34.140]   will launch a shortcut.
[02:04:34.140 --> 02:04:35.420]   Shortcuts are on the Apple Watch,
[02:04:35.420 --> 02:04:38.260]   which the previous app before it was shortcuts
[02:04:38.260 --> 02:04:41.340]   bought by Apple called Workflow was on the Watch
[02:04:41.340 --> 02:04:43.460]   and they took it off and it's back now.
[02:04:43.460 --> 02:04:46.340]   And depending on how it's built,
[02:04:46.340 --> 02:04:47.540]   you can actually have shortcuts
[02:04:47.540 --> 02:04:49.260]   that just run on the Apple Watch
[02:04:49.260 --> 02:04:50.740]   and don't ever talk to the phone
[02:04:50.740 --> 02:04:51.860]   and they just do their thing.
[02:04:51.860 --> 02:04:55.300]   And you can save individual shortcuts
[02:04:55.300 --> 02:04:57.580]   as complications on your watch faces,
[02:04:57.580 --> 02:04:59.620]   not just a link to the app
[02:04:59.620 --> 02:05:01.180]   and then you tap the shortcut.
[02:05:01.180 --> 02:05:03.660]   You can actually pick a specific shortcut
[02:05:03.660 --> 02:05:05.740]   and put it on your Apple Watch,
[02:05:05.740 --> 02:05:08.180]   which has a lot of potential there too.
[02:05:08.180 --> 02:05:09.900]   - The Apple Watch is taking off.
[02:05:09.900 --> 02:05:12.500]   The fact that we can now have our own custom
[02:05:12.500 --> 02:05:17.460]   complications alone makes a huge, huge difference.
[02:05:17.460 --> 02:05:21.220]   Well, I was a little worried because I do a show called
[02:05:21.220 --> 02:05:23.900]   Hands on Mac, which is Mac tips and I'm thinking,
[02:05:23.900 --> 02:05:25.660]   I'm gonna do some automated tips.
[02:05:25.660 --> 02:05:27.900]   And then I thought, God, I wonder if Automator
[02:05:27.900 --> 02:05:30.020]   will be around much longer.
[02:05:30.020 --> 02:05:32.020]   Are they gonna, you think replace Automator
[02:05:32.020 --> 02:05:33.900]   with shortcuts on Mac OS at some point?
[02:05:33.900 --> 02:05:35.420]   - I don't think replace.
[02:05:35.420 --> 02:05:37.580]   I think Automator is gonna keep going
[02:05:37.580 --> 02:05:39.140]   because AppleScript's gonna keep going.
[02:05:39.140 --> 02:05:42.780]   But in the long run, I think, I was surprised actually
[02:05:42.780 --> 02:05:45.740]   that shortcuts isn't on the Mac in Big Sur
[02:05:45.740 --> 02:05:47.060]   because I think it is coming
[02:05:47.060 --> 02:05:48.980]   and I think you will want to have it there.
[02:05:48.980 --> 02:05:51.780]   And then in the long run, I'm sure Automator and AppleScript
[02:05:51.780 --> 02:05:53.700]   will maybe fade into the background a bit,
[02:05:53.700 --> 02:05:55.780]   but they're bringing them over to ARM.
[02:05:55.780 --> 02:05:59.500]   So, and I use ARMator every day to do,
[02:05:59.500 --> 02:06:01.260]   like you said, shell scripts kind of stuff.
[02:06:01.260 --> 02:06:04.460]   The best way to integrate in the Mac interface
[02:06:04.460 --> 02:06:06.340]   with stuff that's happening in the Unix subsystem
[02:06:06.340 --> 02:06:09.380]   is to build little tiny services plugins using Automator.
[02:06:09.380 --> 02:06:11.180]   They just run shell scripts and I love it.
[02:06:11.180 --> 02:06:14.180]   So, that's still there, but I use Workflow
[02:06:14.180 --> 02:06:17.420]   or, sorry, shortcuts, Workflows, all the time on my iPad
[02:06:17.420 --> 02:06:18.860]   and I would love to do that on my Mac too.
[02:06:18.860 --> 02:06:20.820]   - Well, and I think AppleScript is widely used
[02:06:20.820 --> 02:06:22.220]   in pre-press and other places
[02:06:22.220 --> 02:06:24.620]   and I don't know if Apple wants to lose those customers.
[02:06:24.620 --> 02:06:25.460]   So.
[02:06:25.460 --> 02:06:27.220]   - Yeah, I mean, they're not killing a lot
[02:06:27.220 --> 02:06:29.380]   of this legacy stuff because they know their customers want it
[02:06:29.380 --> 02:06:31.500]   and there's no reason to kill Automator and AppleScript.
[02:06:31.500 --> 02:06:33.220]   They're not putting any effort into them,
[02:06:33.220 --> 02:06:35.540]   but there's no real reason to kill them.
[02:06:35.540 --> 02:06:37.700]   And so, I think they'll just keep them around.
[02:06:37.700 --> 02:06:42.580]   And, but I will say having used shortcuts a lot on iPad,
[02:06:42.580 --> 02:06:43.980]   there are a lot of things that shortcuts
[02:06:43.980 --> 02:06:46.020]   is way better at than Automator.
[02:06:46.020 --> 02:06:48.300]   It's, you know, it's limitations are mostly Mac
[02:06:48.300 --> 02:06:50.700]   versus iPad things like on the Mac,
[02:06:50.700 --> 02:06:53.580]   I can go to the command line and I can't really do that
[02:06:53.580 --> 02:06:54.420]   on the iPad.
[02:06:54.420 --> 02:06:57.260]   I go to some other devices command line using SSH,
[02:06:57.260 --> 02:06:59.140]   but I can't go to my iPad's command line
[02:06:59.140 --> 02:07:00.180]   because it doesn't have one.
[02:07:00.180 --> 02:07:01.020]   - That's interesting.
[02:07:01.020 --> 02:07:03.260]   I would not mind having a comment, you know,
[02:07:03.260 --> 02:07:04.340]   having the three layers.
[02:07:04.340 --> 02:07:05.980]   You have AppleScript, you have Automator
[02:07:05.980 --> 02:07:07.900]   and at the highest level, you have shortcuts.
[02:07:07.900 --> 02:07:10.420]   That could be a great ecosystem.
[02:07:10.420 --> 02:07:13.140]   - All I gotta do is run a, like, a do shortcut thing
[02:07:13.140 --> 02:07:16.020]   and Automator and a run an Automator thing in shortcuts
[02:07:16.020 --> 02:07:17.540]   and you got it, you got a bridge.
[02:07:17.540 --> 02:07:20.140]   - Yeah, then you can then really disguise the limit.
[02:07:20.140 --> 02:07:21.580]   All right, Dan, your turn.
[02:07:21.580 --> 02:07:25.740]   - I'm excited by all of the sort of translation
[02:07:25.740 --> 02:07:27.620]   everywhere stuff that Apple is doing.
[02:07:27.620 --> 02:07:30.900]   So there's a translation app coming to iOS.
[02:07:30.900 --> 02:07:33.140]   There's translation built into Safari.
[02:07:33.140 --> 02:07:34.700]   I mean, this is stuff obviously that Google
[02:07:34.700 --> 02:07:36.660]   has done with Google Translate and they've done it well
[02:07:36.660 --> 02:07:38.780]   for years and Apple is no longer content
[02:07:38.780 --> 02:07:40.060]   to sort of see that ground.
[02:07:40.060 --> 02:07:42.300]   But, you know, I think back to a few years ago
[02:07:42.300 --> 02:07:44.220]   when my now wife was working in India
[02:07:44.220 --> 02:07:45.700]   and I went and stayed with her for six weeks
[02:07:45.700 --> 02:07:48.060]   and I had to be there one day when the guy came
[02:07:48.060 --> 02:07:50.180]   to repair the air conditioner in the room
[02:07:50.180 --> 02:07:52.540]   and it turned out that he only spoke Hindi.
[02:07:52.540 --> 02:07:54.580]   And so I had to like call my wife at work
[02:07:54.580 --> 02:07:56.220]   and she had to put one of her coworkers on
[02:07:56.220 --> 02:07:58.660]   and we're like trying to navigate this phone chain.
[02:07:58.660 --> 02:08:01.340]   And, you know, I thought, well, it's so much easier.
[02:08:01.340 --> 02:08:03.300]   Like technology should exist and it does exist,
[02:08:03.300 --> 02:08:04.340]   but how well does it work?
[02:08:04.340 --> 02:08:05.980]   So the fact that it can do all this
[02:08:05.980 --> 02:08:07.900]   and it can do it all on device as well,
[02:08:07.900 --> 02:08:09.340]   which I think is a big thing.
[02:08:09.340 --> 02:08:12.220]   You know, Apple's pointing out the privacy aspects of that.
[02:08:12.220 --> 02:08:13.620]   I think that's kind of huge.
[02:08:13.620 --> 02:08:15.540]   So being able to just build that in
[02:08:15.540 --> 02:08:18.620]   and make it sort of a one click thing in Safari
[02:08:18.620 --> 02:08:20.100]   is a big deal, honestly.
[02:08:20.100 --> 02:08:22.300]   And not just obviously being reliant
[02:08:22.300 --> 02:08:25.980]   to Google's technology makes, is great for Apple,
[02:08:25.980 --> 02:08:30.180]   but it also potentially provides a good competitiveness
[02:08:30.180 --> 02:08:31.100]   for its users, right?
[02:08:31.100 --> 02:08:34.580]   Like in terms of Google and Apple having to work
[02:08:34.580 --> 02:08:36.980]   a little bit more in order to make a good product.
[02:08:36.980 --> 02:08:38.900]   So I'm really excited about that.
[02:08:38.900 --> 02:08:42.180]   I think that's potentially a really big improvement.
[02:08:42.180 --> 02:08:44.300]   There have only got a few languages right now.
[02:08:44.300 --> 02:08:45.220]   I was disappointed the other day
[02:08:45.220 --> 02:08:47.460]   'cause I saw a tweet about one of my books
[02:08:47.460 --> 02:08:49.940]   and it was on a podcast in Swedish.
[02:08:49.940 --> 02:08:51.540]   And I was like, oh, I'll go to the website.
[02:08:51.540 --> 02:08:54.020]   I can translate it and it doesn't support Swedish yet.
[02:08:54.020 --> 02:08:54.860]   Unfortunately.
[02:08:54.860 --> 02:08:56.580]   So that was one thing.
[02:08:56.580 --> 02:08:58.140]   The other one I want throughout there was,
[02:08:58.140 --> 02:08:59.140]   it's funny, I was on,
[02:08:59.140 --> 02:09:00.340]   I think the last time I was on Twitch
[02:09:00.340 --> 02:09:01.780]   was right before the coronavirus.
[02:09:01.780 --> 02:09:03.700]   It was the very beginning of the coronavirus
[02:09:03.700 --> 02:09:04.740]   'cause I remember us talking about,
[02:09:04.740 --> 02:09:06.420]   I think that was maybe when,
[02:09:06.420 --> 02:09:08.780]   was it Mobile World Congress was canceled?
[02:09:08.780 --> 02:09:12.100]   And the addition in Watteau has seven
[02:09:12.100 --> 02:09:13.660]   of the washer hands.
[02:09:13.660 --> 02:09:14.860]   - I love that.
[02:09:14.860 --> 02:09:17.900]   - I love it, I do, because I have become obsessive ever since.
[02:09:17.900 --> 02:09:19.180]   I'm gonna show it with you.
[02:09:19.180 --> 02:09:20.220]   Oh, you gotta wash your hands.
[02:09:20.220 --> 02:09:21.820]   All right, 20 seconds every time.
[02:09:21.820 --> 02:09:24.740]   And so I love, it's a clever little thing
[02:09:24.740 --> 02:09:25.940]   that Apple shows like, look,
[02:09:25.940 --> 02:09:28.140]   we recognize that this is the thing we're all doing.
[02:09:28.140 --> 02:09:30.380]   Here's something maybe we can do
[02:09:30.380 --> 02:09:33.060]   that helps a little bit push things forward
[02:09:33.060 --> 02:09:36.420]   and just making sure everybody's taking good care of themselves.
[02:09:36.420 --> 02:09:38.020]   And it's clever.
[02:09:38.020 --> 02:09:39.780]   And so I really enjoyed that a lot.
[02:09:39.780 --> 02:09:41.100]   I think that's a very fun
[02:09:41.100 --> 02:09:43.620]   and immediately useful thing that you can have.
[02:09:43.620 --> 02:09:46.340]   - Yeah, actually I appreciate their matting dance
[02:09:46.340 --> 02:09:49.980]   and cool down, renaming,
[02:09:49.980 --> 02:09:51.100]   what are they calling activity now?
[02:09:51.100 --> 02:09:51.940]   Fitness.
[02:09:51.940 --> 02:09:52.780]   - Fitness, yeah.
[02:09:52.780 --> 02:09:54.380]   - That's more appropriate.
[02:09:54.380 --> 02:09:58.100]   And I do think that, so they're watching your hand motions,
[02:09:58.100 --> 02:10:00.940]   apparently washing is an unusual motion.
[02:10:00.940 --> 02:10:02.380]   And then they're also listening,
[02:10:02.380 --> 02:10:04.900]   they said for the squish of the soap,
[02:10:04.900 --> 02:10:06.100]   which is hysterical.
[02:10:06.100 --> 02:10:08.340]   And then it puts up a little timer on you
[02:10:08.340 --> 02:10:10.260]   and so make sure that you wash and it will tell you.
[02:10:10.260 --> 02:10:11.180]   - And it'll stop.
[02:10:11.180 --> 02:10:12.500]   Yeah, exactly, it'll tell you,
[02:10:12.500 --> 02:10:13.580]   "Oh, you gotta keep going."
[02:10:13.580 --> 02:10:15.180]   - Yeah, I'm not done yet.
[02:10:15.180 --> 02:10:16.220]   - I wish they do something.
[02:10:16.220 --> 02:10:17.340]   You're touching your face.
[02:10:17.340 --> 02:10:18.620]   You're touching your face, Leo.
[02:10:18.620 --> 02:10:20.460]   Stop touching your face.
[02:10:20.460 --> 02:10:23.260]   - Like a, a, a, a, a, a proximity sensor alert
[02:10:23.260 --> 02:10:24.940]   that just gets close to you.
[02:10:24.940 --> 02:10:25.780]   - I think they can do that, yeah.
[02:10:25.780 --> 02:10:26.620]   - As it gets close to you.
[02:10:26.620 --> 02:10:27.460]   - That's right, like when you're car, right?
[02:10:27.460 --> 02:10:28.820]   When you're back in your car, the driveway.
[02:10:28.820 --> 02:10:30.420]   - Yeah, beep, beep, beep, beep, beep.
[02:10:30.420 --> 02:10:32.260]   (laughing)
[02:10:32.260 --> 02:10:35.620]   There's also some new AirPods
[02:10:35.620 --> 02:10:38.100]   and AirPods Pro features coming.
[02:10:38.100 --> 02:10:41.060]   There's, you know, not just the spatial awareness stuff,
[02:10:41.060 --> 02:10:42.500]   but there's accessibility features
[02:10:42.500 --> 02:10:46.860]   that are gonna be used beneficial with AirPods Pro,
[02:10:46.860 --> 02:10:51.860]   like opening up, oh, you can customize the EQ
[02:10:52.460 --> 02:10:55.660]   of your AirPods Pro based on your hearing needs.
[02:10:55.660 --> 02:10:57.860]   So, you know, like I have tinnitus.
[02:10:57.860 --> 02:10:58.700]   - Yes.
[02:10:58.700 --> 02:11:00.220]   - So I can't hear bright noises.
[02:11:00.220 --> 02:11:02.060]   It hurts me to hear bright noises.
[02:11:02.060 --> 02:11:04.580]   So I would EQ a little more bassy.
[02:11:04.580 --> 02:11:06.020]   My brother's deaf in one ear,
[02:11:06.020 --> 02:11:08.460]   so he would EQ it completely different.
[02:11:08.460 --> 02:11:12.620]   And that also can be customized through AirPods Pro
[02:11:12.620 --> 02:11:13.860]   with transparency.
[02:11:13.860 --> 02:11:17.620]   So when you're out and about, you can enhance
[02:11:17.620 --> 02:11:19.100]   the sounds of people talking
[02:11:19.100 --> 02:11:21.500]   or the sound like the environmental sounds around you.
[02:11:21.500 --> 02:11:23.260]   So you actually hear that better
[02:11:23.260 --> 02:11:25.940]   to protect you more when you're walking around outside.
[02:11:25.940 --> 02:11:29.340]   And there's so many amazing things coming.
[02:11:29.340 --> 02:11:33.420]   The alert, you can set your iPhone to alert you
[02:11:33.420 --> 02:11:35.420]   if there's a smoke alarm going off
[02:11:35.420 --> 02:11:37.100]   or if someone rings a doorbell
[02:11:37.100 --> 02:11:39.620]   or if there's a siren going by outside.
[02:11:39.620 --> 02:11:41.220]   This is another accessibility feature,
[02:11:41.220 --> 02:11:43.020]   but it also can be helpful, you know,
[02:11:43.020 --> 02:11:46.580]   for people just, you know, with everyday life stuff
[02:11:46.580 --> 02:11:49.220]   that don't have accessibility needs,
[02:11:49.220 --> 02:11:50.540]   but it's just a benefit anyway.
[02:11:50.540 --> 02:11:52.540]   So lots and lots of good things coming.
[02:11:52.540 --> 02:11:53.380]   - We're gonna take a little break.
[02:11:53.380 --> 02:11:54.740]   When we come back, I do want to talk about
[02:11:54.740 --> 02:11:57.580]   some really interesting already,
[02:11:57.580 --> 02:12:01.100]   the new privacy features in iOS 14 have busted
[02:12:01.100 --> 02:12:04.340]   a number of apps for doing really bad stuff.
[02:12:04.340 --> 02:12:06.220]   And I have to say, I'm very excited
[02:12:06.220 --> 02:12:08.100]   about the privacy features.
[02:12:08.100 --> 02:12:09.460]   And then I'll find something
[02:12:09.460 --> 02:12:10.980]   that has nothing to do with Apple.
[02:12:10.980 --> 02:12:14.820]   Just to, by now, if you don't like Apple,
[02:12:14.820 --> 02:12:15.740]   you stop listening.
[02:12:15.740 --> 02:12:18.940]   So I just have to assume everybody listening
[02:12:18.940 --> 02:12:20.220]   wants to hear more about Apple.
[02:12:20.220 --> 02:12:23.060]   But we'll find some other stories as well.
[02:12:23.060 --> 02:12:24.900]   Great panel, really fun.
[02:12:24.900 --> 02:12:26.940]   And I do think, and the reason we're devoting
[02:12:26.940 --> 02:12:27.780]   so much time to this,
[02:12:27.780 --> 02:12:30.100]   these are very important announcements.
[02:12:30.100 --> 02:12:31.340]   And not just for Mac users,
[02:12:31.340 --> 02:12:35.260]   but this is gonna change computing as we know it, I think.
[02:12:35.260 --> 02:12:36.620]   One of the things Apple's doing
[02:12:36.620 --> 02:12:39.300]   is changing the password space.
[02:12:39.300 --> 02:12:41.420]   They're gonna add some interesting password features.
[02:12:41.420 --> 02:12:44.460]   The good news is you still will want LastPass,
[02:12:44.460 --> 02:12:46.060]   especially if you're a business.
[02:12:46.060 --> 02:12:48.300]   We're coming to you from the LastPass studios.
[02:12:48.300 --> 02:12:51.860]   I've been using LastPass since it came out more than 10 years ago.
[02:12:51.860 --> 02:12:53.660]   We started using LastPass at Twit,
[02:12:53.660 --> 02:12:56.180]   the enterprise version several years ago.
[02:12:56.180 --> 02:12:58.300]   Because it's really important.
[02:12:58.300 --> 02:13:01.020]   I know how to protect my passwords.
[02:13:01.020 --> 02:13:02.540]   I don't reuse passwords.
[02:13:02.540 --> 02:13:05.500]   My password is not my dog's middle name and my birthday.
[02:13:05.500 --> 02:13:07.860]   It's my dog's first name and birthday.
[02:13:07.860 --> 02:13:11.080]   No, no, I use good, long, strong, random passwords.
[02:13:11.080 --> 02:13:12.620]   But your employees, maybe not.
[02:13:12.620 --> 02:13:15.660]   And the problem is your employees have access to stuff.
[02:13:15.660 --> 02:13:16.860]   The keys to the kingdom.
[02:13:16.860 --> 02:13:19.740]   I mean, your bank accounts, your databases,
[02:13:19.740 --> 02:13:22.420]   your customer records, they're logging into them.
[02:13:22.420 --> 02:13:24.060]   You wanna make sure they have the same
[02:13:24.060 --> 02:13:26.860]   great password practices you do.
[02:13:26.860 --> 02:13:27.940]   And that's LastPass.
[02:13:27.940 --> 02:13:29.220]   It was more than just passwords.
[02:13:29.220 --> 02:13:32.780]   The best enterprise grade password management out there
[02:13:32.780 --> 02:13:34.940]   ensures oversight of shadow IT.
[02:13:34.940 --> 02:13:37.660]   You've got enforceable policies across all password
[02:13:37.660 --> 02:13:39.460]   protected accounts.
[02:13:39.460 --> 02:13:43.140]   For instance, we require our staff use two factor
[02:13:43.140 --> 02:13:44.340]   authentication.
[02:13:44.340 --> 02:13:46.620]   LastPass supports it in every way possible.
[02:13:46.620 --> 02:13:47.460]   But they do more.
[02:13:47.460 --> 02:13:49.420]   They also have multi-factor, which I love.
[02:13:49.420 --> 02:13:53.340]   Yes, they use biometrics like fingerprint and face ID.
[02:13:53.340 --> 02:13:58.020]   But they also use contextual factors like geolocation
[02:13:58.020 --> 02:13:59.220]   or IP address.
[02:13:59.220 --> 02:14:00.940]   And all of this is designed to make sure
[02:14:00.940 --> 02:14:03.100]   that the person using your resources
[02:14:03.100 --> 02:14:05.820]   is the person authorized to using them.
[02:14:05.820 --> 02:14:06.860]   But there's a side effect.
[02:14:06.860 --> 02:14:10.220]   It also makes it easier and smoother for employees.
[02:14:10.220 --> 02:14:11.860]   LastPass, auto fills passwords.
[02:14:11.860 --> 02:14:13.300]   They don't have to remember them.
[02:14:13.300 --> 02:14:15.020]   It'll automatically create passwords.
[02:14:15.020 --> 02:14:16.620]   They don't have to generate them.
[02:14:16.620 --> 02:14:18.900]   The biometrics employees love those.
[02:14:18.900 --> 02:14:20.380]   They also support single sign-on.
[02:14:20.380 --> 02:14:22.540]   In fact, they have more than 1,200 single sign-on apps.
[02:14:22.540 --> 02:14:23.620]   That's the easiest of all.
[02:14:23.620 --> 02:14:26.180]   You just say yes on your phone and you're in.
[02:14:26.180 --> 02:14:29.420]   But what's great for you is that makes you more secure.
[02:14:29.420 --> 02:14:31.420]   What's great for employee, it makes it more convenient.
[02:14:31.420 --> 02:14:32.260]   And you know what?
[02:14:32.260 --> 02:14:35.500]   If security is convenient for employees, they'll do it.
[02:14:35.500 --> 02:14:36.540]   And that's really important.
[02:14:36.540 --> 02:14:40.380]   Of course, with LastPass, IT always has insight into who
[02:14:40.380 --> 02:14:44.100]   has access to what and from where you're sending employees
[02:14:44.100 --> 02:14:45.660]   to the home, they're working out of the house,
[02:14:45.660 --> 02:14:47.580]   you really need to have LastPass.
[02:14:47.580 --> 02:14:49.660]   If they're logging into the company VPN,
[02:14:49.660 --> 02:14:53.100]   LastPass adds multi-factor to that login,
[02:14:53.100 --> 02:14:55.700]   making it that much more secure.
[02:14:55.700 --> 02:14:58.500]   And of course, LastPass, as I'm sure you know,
[02:14:58.500 --> 02:15:02.540]   but I will reassure you, uses all the best practices.
[02:15:02.540 --> 02:15:05.100]   They never own your password.
[02:15:05.100 --> 02:15:08.460]   They neither send it nor store the master password.
[02:15:08.460 --> 02:15:11.940]   All your data is decrypted on your device.
[02:15:11.940 --> 02:15:15.340]   It's never, ever sent anywhere without encryption.
[02:15:15.340 --> 02:15:19.060]   That means LastPass has no access to your password vault.
[02:15:19.060 --> 02:15:21.740]   And of course, if they don't need to the bad guys,
[02:15:21.740 --> 02:15:22.940]   neither does law enforcement.
[02:15:22.940 --> 02:15:24.460]   Your stuff is highly protected.
[02:15:24.460 --> 02:15:26.300]   It's true trust, no one encryption.
[02:15:26.300 --> 02:15:28.620]   AES-256.
[02:15:28.620 --> 02:15:33.020]   LastPass works everywhere, including your Apple Watch,
[02:15:33.020 --> 02:15:37.140]   including your phone, your computer, every browser.
[02:15:37.140 --> 02:15:38.060]   I use it on Linux.
[02:15:38.060 --> 02:15:39.540]   It's really great.
[02:15:39.540 --> 02:15:42.060]   And in business, it's so important to make it easy
[02:15:42.060 --> 02:15:43.900]   for your employees to do the right thing.
[02:15:43.900 --> 02:15:45.860]   And that's what LastPass does.
[02:15:45.860 --> 02:15:49.540]   LastPass can help make remote works simple and secure.
[02:15:49.540 --> 02:15:51.580]   Visit LastPass.com/twit to find out
[02:15:51.580 --> 02:15:54.500]   how they can help your business stay productive and secure
[02:15:54.500 --> 02:15:57.420]   no matter what now more than ever.
[02:15:57.420 --> 02:15:59.020]   And you've got to have it for business,
[02:15:59.020 --> 02:16:02.060]   as well as home, LastPass.com/twit.
[02:16:02.060 --> 02:16:05.820]   We thank them so much for supporting the network,
[02:16:05.820 --> 02:16:09.700]   for paying for our studio naming,
[02:16:09.700 --> 02:16:11.460]   and just for being a great partner.
[02:16:11.460 --> 02:16:13.540]   We've got a LastPass event coming up in the fall.
[02:16:13.540 --> 02:16:15.940]   I think I'm going to guess it's probably still
[02:16:15.940 --> 02:16:17.580]   going to be remote, but that's actually good news.
[02:16:17.580 --> 02:16:18.620]   It means everybody can attend.
[02:16:18.620 --> 02:16:22.420]   And we'll fill you in on that as we get closer to the date.
[02:16:22.420 --> 02:16:30.700]   So I guess Apple now has these permissions for intents.
[02:16:30.700 --> 02:16:32.740]   So developers, when they create iPhone apps,
[02:16:32.740 --> 02:16:34.860]   they have to say, well, these are the things
[02:16:34.860 --> 02:16:36.420]   we want access to.
[02:16:36.420 --> 02:16:41.900]   And Apple will now not only ask you about that,
[02:16:41.900 --> 02:16:43.660]   but also tell you about the privacy policy.
[02:16:43.660 --> 02:16:46.780]   They give you a lot more information about what an app is
[02:16:46.780 --> 02:16:47.420]   doing.
[02:16:47.420 --> 02:16:49.340]   And one of the things it turns out
[02:16:49.340 --> 02:16:53.300]   Apple has done in iOS 14 is it tells you
[02:16:53.300 --> 02:16:59.620]   when an app is reading your clipboard, which Jeremy Burge,
[02:16:59.620 --> 02:17:04.180]   we know well from Mogepedia.com.
[02:17:04.180 --> 02:17:07.740]   After he installed iOS 14, he noted
[02:17:07.740 --> 02:17:11.180]   that TikTok was grabbing the contents of his clipboard
[02:17:11.180 --> 02:17:14.580]   every one to three keystrokes.
[02:17:14.580 --> 02:17:16.300]   So he was getting the Apple slide down.
[02:17:16.300 --> 02:17:17.940]   TikTok pasted from Instagram.
[02:17:17.940 --> 02:17:19.460]   TikTok pasted from Instagram.
[02:17:19.460 --> 02:17:24.420]   He's on Instagram, but TikTok is grabbing what he's typing.
[02:17:24.420 --> 02:17:27.020]   Now, maybe that's a bug.
[02:17:27.020 --> 02:17:30.500]   Maybe that's TikTok thinking no one would ever know.
[02:17:30.500 --> 02:17:34.300]   But I love it that Apple is revealing this kind of stuff.
[02:17:34.300 --> 02:17:35.780]   I'm sure they're going to--
[02:17:35.780 --> 02:17:39.660]   people are going to be pissed off about it, but good, good.
[02:17:39.660 --> 02:17:45.660]   It's similar to finding out that apps are using Bluetooth.
[02:17:45.660 --> 02:17:47.020]   And you're just--
[02:17:47.020 --> 02:17:50.660]   Why is this happening in Bluetooth out of nowhere?
[02:17:50.660 --> 02:17:54.180]   So it's a way for us to really better understand
[02:17:54.180 --> 02:17:55.820]   what apps are doing.
[02:17:55.820 --> 02:17:59.780]   I never would have imagined that an app would even
[02:17:59.780 --> 02:18:03.100]   need access to be copying from the clipboard
[02:18:03.100 --> 02:18:05.580]   if it weren't in its own--
[02:18:05.580 --> 02:18:07.780]   I'm amazed Apple lets it.
[02:18:07.780 --> 02:18:09.580]   I'm glad they tell us now, right?
[02:18:09.580 --> 02:18:10.420]   Yeah.
[02:18:10.420 --> 02:18:16.540]   So we can hold these companies accountable to that kind of stuff.
[02:18:16.540 --> 02:18:19.780]   You better give me a good reason why you're copying my clipboard
[02:18:19.780 --> 02:18:23.420]   when I'm at my banking app or something like that.
[02:18:23.420 --> 02:18:26.660]   And there's privacy controls now around accessing
[02:18:26.660 --> 02:18:29.380]   the local network, too, which is kind of a big thing,
[02:18:29.380 --> 02:18:31.860]   where it's looking for other devices on the network
[02:18:31.860 --> 02:18:34.380]   and talking to them, which can be used legitimately in cases
[02:18:34.380 --> 02:18:38.060]   that you want to Chromecast something to another device.
[02:18:38.060 --> 02:18:40.140]   They might need to talk to the outside network for that
[02:18:40.140 --> 02:18:41.500]   specifically.
[02:18:41.500 --> 02:18:43.260]   But yeah, it's also letting you know if they're
[02:18:43.260 --> 02:18:46.380]   trying to look around and find other devices on your network,
[02:18:46.380 --> 02:18:47.100]   for some reason.
[02:18:47.100 --> 02:18:49.980]   It's also a positive to be alerted of that.
[02:18:49.980 --> 02:18:52.020]   Now, remember, this is the beta of iOS 4--
[02:18:52.020 --> 02:18:53.660]   developer beta of iOS 14.
[02:18:53.660 --> 02:18:56.100]   I have not installed any of the betas.
[02:18:56.100 --> 02:18:59.180]   I'm so glad you guys are willing to get a piss.
[02:18:59.180 --> 02:19:00.500]   It's pretty stable, right?
[02:19:00.500 --> 02:19:02.140]   You haven't any problems?
[02:19:02.140 --> 02:19:05.980]   Well, in Dev1, don't take that for granted, though.
[02:19:05.980 --> 02:19:08.140]   It might just completely fall apart.
[02:19:08.140 --> 02:19:10.100]   I put Big Sur on my MacBook Air,
[02:19:10.100 --> 02:19:11.860]   and it still won't open email, which I've
[02:19:11.860 --> 02:19:13.220]   decided to consider a feature.
[02:19:13.220 --> 02:19:14.100]   That's a feature.
[02:19:14.100 --> 02:19:15.020]   Yeah, hell, right.
[02:19:15.020 --> 02:19:15.820]   Hell yeah.
[02:19:15.820 --> 02:19:16.340]   Oh, never mind.
[02:19:16.340 --> 02:19:18.260]   I'm just following it now.
[02:19:18.260 --> 02:19:22.700]   We had talked about creating a volume on your Mac
[02:19:22.700 --> 02:19:25.300]   so that you can just test it side by side.
[02:19:25.300 --> 02:19:26.300]   Can't do that.
[02:19:26.300 --> 02:19:28.060]   I don't know if you've heard about this,
[02:19:28.060 --> 02:19:29.740]   but don't do it.
[02:19:29.740 --> 02:19:31.940]   I'm working it out and trying to figure out
[02:19:31.940 --> 02:19:34.900]   what's going on and what I can do to backtrack
[02:19:34.900 --> 02:19:36.220]   from where I'm at.
[02:19:36.220 --> 02:19:40.060]   So what happens when you create a volume on your Mac
[02:19:40.060 --> 02:19:43.380]   and you install the developer beta of Big Sur,
[02:19:43.380 --> 02:19:49.300]   it attaches that update request to your main volume.
[02:19:49.300 --> 02:19:53.060]   So right now, my main volume is on Catalina,
[02:19:53.060 --> 02:19:55.980]   and it's requesting me to update to Big Sur.
[02:19:55.980 --> 02:19:57.140]   I don't have to do it.
[02:19:57.140 --> 02:20:00.580]   It just sits there saying, you have an update to Big Sur.
[02:20:00.580 --> 02:20:02.220]   And I just leave it alone.
[02:20:02.220 --> 02:20:03.620]   But I didn't want--
[02:20:03.620 --> 02:20:07.380]   I need my Mac to stay on the Catalina path for updates
[02:20:07.380 --> 02:20:10.580]   until Big Sur comes out.
[02:20:10.580 --> 02:20:13.380]   So right now, it's just sitting there in limbo.
[02:20:13.380 --> 02:20:16.180]   I'm still trying to figure out, is there a better way?
[02:20:16.180 --> 02:20:19.940]   I don't know how that works volumes versus partitions.
[02:20:19.940 --> 02:20:21.620]   I'm getting feedback from other people
[02:20:21.620 --> 02:20:24.500]   that even partitioning your Mac will do the same thing.
[02:20:24.500 --> 02:20:28.900]   So don't partition or create a volume on your Mac
[02:20:28.900 --> 02:20:31.620]   to do a side-by-side install, because that actually
[02:20:31.620 --> 02:20:33.020]   is not working for the demo.
[02:20:33.020 --> 02:20:36.020]   After you told us that's how to do it, how you were doing it,
[02:20:36.020 --> 02:20:37.020]   I saw this on Reddit.
[02:20:37.020 --> 02:20:40.700]   Warning, do not install Big Sur on the same APFS container
[02:20:40.700 --> 02:20:42.100]   as previous versions.
[02:20:42.100 --> 02:20:44.220]   If you do, system software updates
[02:20:44.220 --> 02:20:47.860]   can no longer be installed on the previous versions of Mac OS.
[02:20:47.860 --> 02:20:51.820]   Also, you get an error on boot, staying in compatible disk.
[02:20:51.820 --> 02:20:55.700]   So be careful if you're going to do that.
[02:20:55.700 --> 02:20:57.460]   I just put it right over the Catalina.
[02:20:57.460 --> 02:20:59.500]   You should just install it on top of it.
[02:20:59.500 --> 02:21:00.740]   I'm getting rid of--
[02:21:00.740 --> 02:21:02.620]   That one's way for the art replacement.
[02:21:02.620 --> 02:21:03.620]   Yeah.
[02:21:03.620 --> 02:21:07.900]   Also, for $120, you can get a Samsung 500 gig SSD.
[02:21:07.900 --> 02:21:08.420]   Right.
[02:21:08.420 --> 02:21:09.820]   External, and install it on that.
[02:21:09.820 --> 02:21:11.300]   That's not the same volume.
[02:21:11.300 --> 02:21:12.100]   Yeah.
[02:21:12.100 --> 02:21:14.220]   And then you can send it to a totally different volume.
[02:21:14.220 --> 02:21:16.780]   That's exactly the right way to do it right now.
[02:21:16.780 --> 02:21:20.100]   And frankly, if you really want to make sure
[02:21:20.100 --> 02:21:21.380]   that your hard drive is safe, that's
[02:21:21.380 --> 02:21:24.340]   the way to do it is to install it on an external hard drive,
[02:21:24.340 --> 02:21:24.940]   for sure.
[02:21:24.940 --> 02:21:25.540]   Right.
[02:21:25.540 --> 02:21:28.060]   That wouldn't have any of these pitfalls.
[02:21:28.060 --> 02:21:31.380]   Also, there's going to be some help to pay.
[02:21:31.380 --> 02:21:33.460]   Maybe Apple back off on this, I don't know.
[02:21:33.460 --> 02:21:36.420]   But among the other permissions, for the first time ever,
[02:21:36.420 --> 02:21:42.660]   it's exposing the Apple IDFA, the advertising tracking cookie.
[02:21:42.660 --> 02:21:44.020]   Here's the pop-up.
[02:21:44.020 --> 02:21:46.580]   You'll see a new user permission.
[02:21:46.580 --> 02:21:48.260]   Palabout, which is a made-up app,
[02:21:48.260 --> 02:21:52.660]   would like permission to track you across apps and websites
[02:21:52.660 --> 02:21:54.820]   owned by other companies.
[02:21:54.820 --> 02:21:57.980]   Your data will be used to deliver personalized ads for you.
[02:21:57.980 --> 02:22:00.860]   Allow tracking or ask app not to track.
[02:22:00.860 --> 02:22:02.340]   Now, that setting's been there before,
[02:22:02.340 --> 02:22:06.220]   but the fact that it surfaces it is worrying a lot of people
[02:22:06.220 --> 02:22:09.740]   because they think, now everybody's going to know.
[02:22:09.740 --> 02:22:10.340]   That's a shame.
[02:22:10.340 --> 02:22:11.700]   I mean, Apple wants to tap Apple.
[02:22:11.700 --> 02:22:12.980]   Track me.
[02:22:12.980 --> 02:22:15.220]   Apple's doing a lot of shame, and I love it.
[02:22:15.220 --> 02:22:17.020]   The app store itself, the apps are
[02:22:17.020 --> 02:22:18.620]   going to have the ability to--
[02:22:18.620 --> 02:22:20.780]   you're basically going to make a privacy declaration
[02:22:20.780 --> 02:22:24.260]   on the app store about what your policies are.
[02:22:24.260 --> 02:22:25.940]   And that's going to be another case
[02:22:25.940 --> 02:22:28.100]   where the ones who've got good policies
[02:22:28.100 --> 02:22:29.220]   are going to be able to trumpet it,
[02:22:29.220 --> 02:22:31.660]   and everybody else is going to be like, mmm.
[02:22:31.660 --> 02:22:35.180]   And a little bit of shame when people think they're
[02:22:35.180 --> 02:22:38.660]   getting away with something is good.
[02:22:38.660 --> 02:22:42.820]   This would be a good thing to try on the election apps.
[02:22:42.820 --> 02:22:45.260]   Both the Biden and the Trump campaign have apps.
[02:22:45.260 --> 02:22:47.900]   They would love for you to install.
[02:22:47.900 --> 02:22:51.980]   And I saw an article on a drip decrypt.co that says,
[02:22:51.980 --> 02:22:57.140]   the Trump app in particular is gathering a lot of data
[02:22:57.140 --> 02:22:59.180]   about people who install it.
[02:22:59.180 --> 02:23:00.780]   So that's something--
[02:23:00.780 --> 02:23:03.940]   maybe you're such a fan of the president, you don't mind.
[02:23:03.940 --> 02:23:06.540]   But it's something to be aware of.
[02:23:06.540 --> 02:23:11.380]   They send device ID, call information, Bluetooth pairing.
[02:23:11.380 --> 02:23:14.300]   Now, and this also, again, it could be an error.
[02:23:14.300 --> 02:23:19.060]   But this is a report in the MIT Technology Review.
[02:23:19.060 --> 02:23:22.340]   The reason they're worried about Bluetooth
[02:23:22.340 --> 02:23:27.340]   is because it could target you with beacons.
[02:23:27.340 --> 02:23:29.180]   It could send you a physical message
[02:23:29.180 --> 02:23:31.740]   as you travel through physical space.
[02:23:31.740 --> 02:23:34.180]   It could send you an ad.
[02:23:34.180 --> 02:23:37.740]   So there's some concern that that might be the plan that
[02:23:37.740 --> 02:23:39.820]   is on your way to the polls or whatever,
[02:23:39.820 --> 02:23:42.420]   or on your way downtown, you could
[02:23:42.420 --> 02:23:45.020]   start getting pop-ups related to where you are.
[02:23:45.020 --> 02:23:47.220]   So I think these--
[02:23:47.220 --> 02:23:50.100]   for a lot of reasons, these warnings will be good.
[02:23:50.100 --> 02:23:52.220]   Apple's not enforcing the privacy policy.
[02:23:52.220 --> 02:23:56.540]   Are they even checking to see if you're telling the truth?
[02:23:56.540 --> 02:23:57.220]   I don't know.
[02:23:57.220 --> 02:23:59.980]   They can scan some things in your app and do it that way.
[02:23:59.980 --> 02:24:00.820]   But it's unclear.
[02:24:00.820 --> 02:24:03.100]   Nobody wants to risk being delisted, I guess.
[02:24:03.100 --> 02:24:05.220]   Yeah, I mean, it's an interesting power move.
[02:24:05.220 --> 02:24:06.260]   We'll see how it goes.
[02:24:06.260 --> 02:24:10.140]   But I think it shows that Apple wants
[02:24:10.140 --> 02:24:12.940]   to put its customers first when it comes to stuff like this.
[02:24:12.940 --> 02:24:14.860]   And that's part of their selling point.
[02:24:14.860 --> 02:24:19.060]   I signed up for hay.com.
[02:24:19.060 --> 02:24:20.940]   And that was interesting.
[02:24:20.940 --> 02:24:25.340]   That rancorous discussion between Apple and hay
[02:24:25.340 --> 02:24:30.300]   was resolved just before WWDC began.
[02:24:30.300 --> 02:24:35.100]   Hay kind of conceded-- basically, Apple said, look.
[02:24:35.100 --> 02:24:38.180]   Just do something so that the app has some functionality
[02:24:38.180 --> 02:24:41.100]   when you install it, and we'll overlook the rest.
[02:24:41.100 --> 02:24:44.700]   And so hay lets you do a set up a dummy email account
[02:24:44.700 --> 02:24:47.260]   for two weeks with a randomly generated address,
[02:24:47.260 --> 02:24:49.940]   just so the app does something.
[02:24:49.940 --> 02:24:52.500]   But it certainly raised a lot of concern
[02:24:52.500 --> 02:24:55.140]   about the app store, about Apple's 30%.
[02:24:55.140 --> 02:24:59.020]   The developers of hay, with a very well-known base camp,
[02:24:59.020 --> 02:25:03.220]   didn't want Apple to get a third of its $99 a year subscription
[02:25:03.220 --> 02:25:06.100]   fee, so they didn't put in app purchases in the app.
[02:25:06.100 --> 02:25:06.820]   They said, well, wait.
[02:25:06.820 --> 02:25:08.020]   It's just a reader.
[02:25:08.020 --> 02:25:13.020]   Why are you charging?
[02:25:13.020 --> 02:25:14.500]   Why are you preventing?
[02:25:14.500 --> 02:25:15.900]   And this is another thing Apple started to do,
[02:25:15.900 --> 02:25:19.220]   which I'm not sure I like very much, which is,
[02:25:19.220 --> 02:25:20.460]   they're approved of the app, but they
[02:25:20.460 --> 02:25:25.900]   won't approve any bug fixes until hay fixes the problem.
[02:25:25.900 --> 02:25:28.140]   And I think that's kind of a problem.
[02:25:28.140 --> 02:25:29.740]   I think they did just walk that back, though.
[02:25:29.740 --> 02:25:31.620]   That was one announcement that they made during the week,
[02:25:31.620 --> 02:25:33.820]   which is we won't hold up bug fixes anymore
[02:25:33.820 --> 02:25:35.340]   because of violations.
[02:25:35.340 --> 02:25:36.900]   And they also--
[02:25:36.900 --> 02:25:39.580]   Because those bug fixes could be security patches.
[02:25:39.580 --> 02:25:40.300]   Exactly.
[02:25:40.300 --> 02:25:42.900]   And developers will be able to challenge rules,
[02:25:42.900 --> 02:25:43.900]   not just rulings.
[02:25:43.900 --> 02:25:46.940]   Like, you hold back my app, but actual guidelines.
[02:25:46.940 --> 02:25:48.100]   That's the big change.
[02:25:48.100 --> 02:25:49.460]   Yeah.
[02:25:49.460 --> 02:25:51.540]   Again, Apple will have the ultimate say,
[02:25:51.540 --> 02:25:53.940]   but it just is a little bit of a softening.
[02:25:53.940 --> 02:25:57.260]   This in the face of EU regulation on this topic,
[02:25:57.260 --> 02:26:00.540]   among others, so I think this is the right thing to do.
[02:26:00.540 --> 02:26:03.260]   I'm available for an appointment to the App Supreme Court,
[02:26:03.260 --> 02:26:04.260]   by the way.
[02:26:04.260 --> 02:26:06.460]   But you should be a judge.
[02:26:06.460 --> 02:26:07.460]   I got you to gavel.
[02:26:07.460 --> 02:26:08.460]   Give me a gavel.
[02:26:08.460 --> 02:26:09.420]   Yes.
[02:26:09.420 --> 02:26:09.900]   App gavel.
[02:26:09.900 --> 02:26:12.780]   Judge Jason Stell reporting for duty.
[02:26:12.780 --> 02:26:13.780]   What were you going to say?
[02:26:13.780 --> 02:26:15.300]   You didn't have a good judge name.
[02:26:15.300 --> 02:26:16.100]   Yeah, he does.
[02:26:16.100 --> 02:26:16.860]   Judge Jason.
[02:26:16.860 --> 02:26:19.660]   Yeah, I'd watch.
[02:26:19.660 --> 02:26:24.300]   Olympus, after 84 years making some of the best digital
[02:26:24.300 --> 02:26:29.020]   cameras, and before that, my favorite film camera, the OM1,
[02:26:29.020 --> 02:26:33.180]   is finally exiting the camera business.
[02:26:33.180 --> 02:26:37.220]   They're selling the Olympus brand to a third party.
[02:26:37.220 --> 02:26:40.060]   And all they're going to do is, I guess,
[02:26:40.060 --> 02:26:43.100]   make copiers and stuff going forward.
[02:26:43.100 --> 02:26:47.300]   So I'm a little sad about that.
[02:26:47.300 --> 02:26:49.540]   Well, maybe that's kind of like what happened with Polaroid,
[02:26:49.540 --> 02:26:51.940]   is that you'll see this sort of--
[02:26:51.940 --> 02:26:53.220]   Yeah, that's exactly what I'm afraid of.
[02:26:53.220 --> 02:26:56.220]   Wasteland of-- no, no, but Polaroid is back.
[02:26:56.220 --> 02:26:59.660]   And even classic Polaroid, which is owned by a different
[02:26:59.660 --> 02:27:02.900]   company than owns the digital version of Polaroid,
[02:27:02.900 --> 02:27:06.140]   they make fantastic Polaroid cameras with film.
[02:27:06.140 --> 02:27:07.220]   OK.
[02:27:07.220 --> 02:27:10.980]   Yeah, so maybe it's just going to take somebody who loves
[02:27:10.980 --> 02:27:12.660]   Olympus, who wants to bring it back.
[02:27:12.660 --> 02:27:14.580]   And maybe it's not gone forever.
[02:27:14.580 --> 02:27:16.860]   Maybe it's just gone for five to 10 years.
[02:27:16.860 --> 02:27:20.420]   Andy Inaco loves his OMDs.
[02:27:20.420 --> 02:27:21.780]   I used them for a long time.
[02:27:21.780 --> 02:27:23.540]   My wife was a big OMD fan.
[02:27:23.540 --> 02:27:27.420]   Scott Born, one of our great friends, is a Olympus ambassador.
[02:27:27.420 --> 02:27:30.380]   And the Olympus little film cameras, the OM1, that
[02:27:30.380 --> 02:27:32.460]   was one of the greatest cameras of all time.
[02:27:32.460 --> 02:27:36.500]   So if nothing else at the end of an era, the sad thing is it's
[02:27:36.500 --> 02:27:38.860]   one of them activist shareholders,
[02:27:38.860 --> 02:27:42.860]   value-act capital putting pressure on Olympus
[02:27:42.860 --> 02:27:44.500]   forcing them to sell.
[02:27:44.500 --> 02:27:49.460]   I guess they hadn't made much money in cameras for a long time.
[02:27:49.460 --> 02:27:53.260]   In 2007, what happened in 2007 that might have changed the
[02:27:53.260 --> 02:27:54.460]   market?
[02:27:54.460 --> 02:27:59.420]   Digital cameras were a $3 billion a year business for Olympus.
[02:27:59.420 --> 02:28:01.820]   2007 something happened because after that--
[02:28:01.820 --> 02:28:03.660]   [INAUDIBLE]
[02:28:03.660 --> 02:28:04.380]   coincidence.
[02:28:04.380 --> 02:28:06.940]   That's a complete coincidence.
[02:28:06.940 --> 02:28:11.740]   Revenues had dropped even further thanks to coronavirus.
[02:28:11.740 --> 02:28:15.100]   So yeah, that's too bad.
[02:28:15.100 --> 02:28:16.660]   But that happens sometimes.
[02:28:16.660 --> 02:28:22.060]   Finally, we'll wrap it up because it's been a long show.
[02:28:22.060 --> 02:28:22.900]   And it's all been Apple.
[02:28:22.900 --> 02:28:25.620]   But I'm throwing in this stuff just so you don't feel bad.
[02:28:25.620 --> 02:28:27.540]   Non-Apple users.
[02:28:27.540 --> 02:28:29.220]   Finally, our long--
[02:28:29.220 --> 02:28:31.340]   You should have done it at the beginning, not at the end.
[02:28:31.340 --> 02:28:32.580]   You know, I've gone already to you.
[02:28:32.580 --> 02:28:33.820]   I actually could sit here that.
[02:28:33.820 --> 02:28:37.300]   I thought, I could just do a segment of non-Apple stories
[02:28:37.300 --> 02:28:40.300]   and then say, OK, go away because the rest of it is Apple.
[02:28:40.300 --> 02:28:43.140]   But I'm not that organized.
[02:28:43.140 --> 02:28:46.620]   Finally, our long national nightmare is over.
[02:28:46.620 --> 02:28:52.780]   The length of the foot has been settled.
[02:28:52.780 --> 02:28:54.100]   Whose foot is it?
[02:28:54.100 --> 02:28:56.060]   It's not--
[02:28:56.060 --> 02:29:01.300]   Did you know that there are two different definitions
[02:29:01.300 --> 02:29:03.700]   of what a foot is?
[02:29:03.700 --> 02:29:06.020]   And while they don't differ that much, they differ enough.
[02:29:06.020 --> 02:29:07.820]   One's on the end of your leg and one's on the net.
[02:29:07.820 --> 02:29:08.300]   There you go.
[02:29:08.300 --> 02:29:16.260]   The international foot is 0.3048 meters.
[02:29:16.260 --> 02:29:19.940]   The US survey foot is a different thing.
[02:29:19.940 --> 02:29:24.820]   That's 1,200 divided by 3,937th of a meter, which
[02:29:24.820 --> 02:29:26.700]   is an irrational number.
[02:29:26.700 --> 02:29:30.340]   It goes on and on and on, which is a very bad choice.
[02:29:30.340 --> 02:29:33.420]   So people who-- and surveyors are the ones who really suffer
[02:29:33.420 --> 02:29:34.220]   from this.
[02:29:34.220 --> 02:29:36.820]   They actually have to check with the state that they're in
[02:29:36.820 --> 02:29:40.980]   to see, well, whose foot do you use?
[02:29:40.980 --> 02:29:44.140]   In California, we use the US survey foot.
[02:29:44.140 --> 02:29:48.820]   In Oregon, they use the international foot.
[02:29:48.820 --> 02:29:50.700]   I feel like surveyors put is a thing
[02:29:50.700 --> 02:29:53.980]   that people died of in Oregon on trail.
[02:29:53.980 --> 02:29:55.380]   You died of surveyors.
[02:29:55.380 --> 02:29:57.180]   I was just after surveyors, boy.
[02:29:57.180 --> 02:29:58.780]   Got her.
[02:29:58.780 --> 02:30:02.300]   So surveyors knew this, apparently.
[02:30:02.300 --> 02:30:08.820]   But by the end of June of, I guess, next year--
[02:30:08.820 --> 02:30:10.380]   no, 2023.
[02:30:10.380 --> 02:30:11.420]   We've got to do this slowly.
[02:30:11.420 --> 02:30:11.900]   We have time.
[02:30:11.900 --> 02:30:13.660]   We can't rush this.
[02:30:13.660 --> 02:30:14.180]   I think--
[02:30:14.180 --> 02:30:16.380]   So Apple's going to make its process of transition
[02:30:16.380 --> 02:30:17.700]   before they make--
[02:30:17.700 --> 02:30:18.700]   Yes!
[02:30:18.700 --> 02:30:19.700]   Yes!
[02:30:19.700 --> 02:30:21.740]   Wait, is it still a five nanometer processor?
[02:30:21.740 --> 02:30:22.740]   Yeah.
[02:30:22.740 --> 02:30:23.580]   By then, it'll be--
[02:30:23.580 --> 02:30:24.300]   Who knows?
[02:30:24.300 --> 02:30:25.500]   It's a foot long--
[02:30:25.500 --> 02:30:26.540]   foot long prep.
[02:30:26.540 --> 02:30:28.580]   Yeah, check with that foot long coney dog.
[02:30:28.580 --> 02:30:29.020]   It may be--
[02:30:29.020 --> 02:30:29.580]   Oh, man.
[02:30:29.580 --> 02:30:30.980]   What is Subway going to do?
[02:30:30.980 --> 02:30:31.820]   Yeah!
[02:30:31.820 --> 02:30:32.820]   Right!
[02:30:32.820 --> 02:30:33.580]   Oh, man.
[02:30:33.580 --> 02:30:35.300]   Right!
[02:30:35.300 --> 02:30:36.380]   Folks, you are great.
[02:30:36.380 --> 02:30:38.780]   I apologize to anybody still listening,
[02:30:38.780 --> 02:30:43.420]   waiting for news about PCs or Android.
[02:30:43.420 --> 02:30:45.980]   Look, two weeks a year, iPhone Week and WWDC Week.
[02:30:45.980 --> 02:30:46.620]   This is a big week.
[02:30:46.620 --> 02:30:47.980]   Apple really takes it over.
[02:30:47.980 --> 02:30:49.740]   And then, of course, we never hear from Apple
[02:30:49.740 --> 02:30:50.660]   outside of those two weeks.
[02:30:50.660 --> 02:30:53.420]   Well, yeah, I expect actually it's going to get kind of quiet.
[02:30:53.420 --> 02:30:58.420]   Isn't it for a while while Apple works in secret on its transition?
[02:30:58.420 --> 02:30:58.940]   Yeah.
[02:30:58.940 --> 02:31:01.460]   And then, the next big news will be when the new iPhone
[02:31:01.460 --> 02:31:03.540]   and perhaps new MacBook 13 are announced.
[02:31:03.540 --> 02:31:05.660]   But it's not going to be much to say.
[02:31:05.660 --> 02:31:06.860]   So we'll be talking about--
[02:31:06.860 --> 02:31:08.860]   Though, I don't know.
[02:31:08.860 --> 02:31:10.820]   Think about this, though, because there's
[02:31:10.820 --> 02:31:15.060]   all these rumors that there was hardware coming to WWDC.
[02:31:15.060 --> 02:31:18.700]   Apple could, any day now, just say, Apple tags are out.
[02:31:18.700 --> 02:31:20.060]   And AirPods Studio are out.
[02:31:20.060 --> 02:31:20.940]   No, that's a good point.
[02:31:20.940 --> 02:31:22.380]   They have all this stuff that you didn't know.
[02:31:22.380 --> 02:31:23.180]   They could have no nowhere.
[02:31:23.180 --> 02:31:24.180]   Yeah.
[02:31:24.180 --> 02:31:25.180]   No, that's a good point.
[02:31:25.180 --> 02:31:27.940]   They might wait, but it's possible that they'll just decide one day
[02:31:27.940 --> 02:31:29.900]   that they're going to put out a press release.
[02:31:29.900 --> 02:31:32.740]   And we have to scamper to try to figure out what's going on.
[02:31:32.740 --> 02:31:37.180]   Carsten says, I missed the most-- once again,
[02:31:37.180 --> 02:31:39.380]   I missed the most important story of the week.
[02:31:39.380 --> 02:31:40.900]   You be the judge.
[02:31:40.900 --> 02:31:45.100]   Microsoft has decided to kill Mixer.
[02:31:45.100 --> 02:31:45.580]   Well--
[02:31:45.580 --> 02:31:47.540]   I don't know if it's the most effective way.
[02:31:47.540 --> 02:31:49.980]   [LAUGHTER]
[02:31:49.980 --> 02:31:52.980]   We were on Mixer, which was Microsoft's gaming
[02:31:52.980 --> 02:31:53.480]   service.
[02:31:53.480 --> 02:31:55.580]   Actually, you know who's upset is Ninja.
[02:31:55.580 --> 02:31:56.780]   Well, maybe not.
[02:31:56.780 --> 02:31:58.500]   Actually, a Ninja might be thrilled.
[02:31:58.500 --> 02:32:02.380]   Ninja and who is the other guy that moved from Twitch
[02:32:02.380 --> 02:32:06.340]   to Microsoft for a big payment?
[02:32:06.340 --> 02:32:11.580]   Are Ninja and Shroud and other top streamers--
[02:32:11.580 --> 02:32:13.020]   actually, they're probably really happy,
[02:32:13.020 --> 02:32:14.420]   because they can collect their money
[02:32:14.420 --> 02:32:15.700]   and then they go back to Twitch?
[02:32:15.700 --> 02:32:17.220]   No.
[02:32:17.220 --> 02:32:17.900]   Get this.
[02:32:17.900 --> 02:32:22.060]   This is how valuable Ninja is.
[02:32:22.060 --> 02:32:24.980]   Tyler Blevins, who was a gamer, best known,
[02:32:24.980 --> 02:32:27.460]   I think, for Fortnite.
[02:32:27.460 --> 02:32:32.060]   He left Twitch late in August last year
[02:32:32.060 --> 02:32:35.180]   for $20 to $30 million contract.
[02:32:35.180 --> 02:32:37.060]   Not only did Microsoft buy off the contract,
[02:32:37.060 --> 02:32:42.020]   they paid him a bonus to say bye-bye.
[02:32:42.020 --> 02:32:42.780]   Bye-bye.
[02:32:42.780 --> 02:32:43.620]   And Shroud--
[02:32:43.620 --> 02:32:46.380]   Do you remember when you were a little kid and thought,
[02:32:46.380 --> 02:32:47.900]   gee, I wish I could play video games?
[02:32:47.900 --> 02:32:48.580]   Yeah.
[02:32:48.580 --> 02:32:50.420]   Who knew?
[02:32:50.420 --> 02:32:50.940]   Who knew?
[02:32:50.940 --> 02:32:52.460]   Not only can you do it for a living,
[02:32:52.460 --> 02:32:54.100]   but you can be a multi-millionaire.
[02:32:54.100 --> 02:32:56.540]   She's always.
[02:32:56.540 --> 02:33:03.100]   Shroud and Ninja and King Gothalian, or is it Gothalayan?
[02:33:03.100 --> 02:33:04.700]   I don't know.
[02:33:04.700 --> 02:33:09.020]   Will be released from their contracts, as Mixer says,
[02:33:09.020 --> 02:33:09.620]   bye-bye.
[02:33:09.620 --> 02:33:12.900]   They're going to give the Mixer assets to Facebook gaming.
[02:33:12.900 --> 02:33:14.700]   We were streamed on Mixer, but--
[02:33:15.540 --> 02:33:18.140]   I guess we won't be.
[02:33:18.140 --> 02:33:21.940]   They didn't offer me anything.
[02:33:21.940 --> 02:33:22.780]   You guys are great.
[02:33:22.780 --> 02:33:23.860]   Thank you so much.
[02:33:23.860 --> 02:33:25.900]   Dave-- Dave isn't here.
[02:33:25.900 --> 02:33:26.940]   Dave's not here, man.
[02:33:26.940 --> 02:33:27.900]   Dave's not here, man.
[02:33:27.900 --> 02:33:29.180]   Dave's not here, man.
[02:33:29.180 --> 02:33:30.620]   Dan Morin.
[02:33:30.620 --> 02:33:34.140]   Great to have you on sixcolors.com.
[02:33:34.140 --> 02:33:38.580]   Which of your many children do you want to plug?
[02:33:38.580 --> 02:33:40.500]   I'll plug my most recent book, which
[02:33:40.500 --> 02:33:42.980]   is The Owl of Extraction, which is the most recent book
[02:33:42.980 --> 02:33:45.380]   in my Galactic Cold War series.
[02:33:45.380 --> 02:33:48.260]   It's available at Amazon or your local independent bookstore.
[02:33:48.260 --> 02:33:52.420]   I always recommend supporting your local independent bookstore.
[02:33:52.420 --> 02:33:53.780]   Any other fine bookstore?
[02:33:53.780 --> 02:33:55.300]   Should I start with pilot error?
[02:33:55.300 --> 02:33:57.020]   Where should I start in that?
[02:33:57.020 --> 02:33:59.300]   I would start with the Bayer and Agenda, which
[02:33:59.300 --> 02:34:00.940]   is the one that came out last year.
[02:34:00.940 --> 02:34:02.020]   Start with that.
[02:34:02.020 --> 02:34:03.100]   It's a nice, easy entry point.
[02:34:03.100 --> 02:34:04.220]   That'll get me set up, and then I
[02:34:04.220 --> 02:34:07.420]   get to the Aleph Extraction, the new one.
[02:34:07.420 --> 02:34:12.940]   The Bayer and Agenda, the Galactic Cold War saga.
[02:34:12.940 --> 02:34:14.900]   I'm so excited.
[02:34:14.900 --> 02:34:17.980]   I know a celebrity.
[02:34:17.980 --> 02:34:18.900]   That's exciting.
[02:34:18.900 --> 02:34:19.860]   Me too.
[02:34:19.860 --> 02:34:20.620]   Yeah.
[02:34:20.620 --> 02:34:22.220]   Dan Morin.
[02:34:22.220 --> 02:34:22.980]   Thank you, Dan.
[02:34:22.980 --> 02:34:24.100]   Thank you, Jason Snell.
[02:34:24.100 --> 02:34:24.900]   Always a pleasure.
[02:34:24.900 --> 02:34:25.420]   I miss you.
[02:34:25.420 --> 02:34:27.100]   I really do miss seeing you.
[02:34:27.100 --> 02:34:28.340]   And you're smiling face.
[02:34:28.340 --> 02:34:30.300]   We used to see a lot of you around here,
[02:34:30.300 --> 02:34:31.660]   because you're just down the road a piece.
[02:34:31.660 --> 02:34:33.180]   But now I think--
[02:34:33.180 --> 02:34:34.180]   We'll be back some day.
[02:34:34.180 --> 02:34:36.300]   Marin's locking you back down, aren't they?
[02:34:36.300 --> 02:34:36.980]   They're locking you back down.
[02:34:36.980 --> 02:34:38.660]   Yeah, well, I work in my garage,
[02:34:38.660 --> 02:34:41.020]   so I'm pretty much locked down all the time.
[02:34:41.020 --> 02:34:41.980]   Like we've been--
[02:34:41.980 --> 02:34:44.580]   Like I said, we've been planning this for 15 years.
[02:34:44.580 --> 02:34:46.740]   We are ready.
[02:34:46.740 --> 02:34:48.780]   No change at all.
[02:34:48.780 --> 02:34:49.900]   Always a pleasure, Jason.
[02:34:49.900 --> 02:34:52.540]   Sixcolors.com.
[02:34:52.540 --> 02:34:55.260]   The incomparable-- what of your-- many children
[02:34:55.260 --> 02:34:56.660]   would you like to plug?
[02:34:56.660 --> 02:34:59.940]   I would say six colors and the incomparable for podcasts.
[02:34:59.940 --> 02:35:02.220]   And I do a podcast with Mike Hurley called
[02:35:02.220 --> 02:35:03.580]   Upgrade on Relay FM.
[02:35:03.580 --> 02:35:06.420]   That is my sort of weekly tech podcast.
[02:35:06.420 --> 02:35:07.620]   If you want to check that out.
[02:35:07.620 --> 02:35:08.820]   Excellent.
[02:35:08.820 --> 02:35:10.020]   Thank you so much for being here.
[02:35:10.020 --> 02:35:11.340]   You and your lava lamp.
[02:35:11.340 --> 02:35:13.260]   You didn't turn it on.
[02:35:13.260 --> 02:35:13.780]   It's on.
[02:35:13.780 --> 02:35:14.500]   It's glowing.
[02:35:14.500 --> 02:35:15.860]   Oh, yeah, there's a blob.
[02:35:15.860 --> 02:35:17.300]   It's moving very slowly.
[02:35:17.300 --> 02:35:18.380]   In fact, we're done.
[02:35:18.380 --> 02:35:20.500]   So I'm going to turn it off.
[02:35:20.500 --> 02:35:22.100]   It takes a-- whoa!
[02:35:22.100 --> 02:35:23.900]   Fancy.
[02:35:23.900 --> 02:35:28.180]   Either he has a switch under his desk,
[02:35:28.180 --> 02:35:29.540]   or he's got some sort of--
[02:35:29.540 --> 02:35:31.220]   Is that home kick compatible?
[02:35:31.220 --> 02:35:31.740]   Some sort of--
[02:35:31.740 --> 02:35:32.220]   It is.
[02:35:32.220 --> 02:35:32.820]   It is.
[02:35:32.820 --> 02:35:35.420]   Where do you get a home kick compatible lava lamp?
[02:35:35.420 --> 02:35:36.580]   You know, it's a smart switch.
[02:35:36.580 --> 02:35:37.420]   Yeah.
[02:35:37.420 --> 02:35:38.860]   Oh, OK.
[02:35:38.860 --> 02:35:40.700]   You know, I was very disappointed when I found out
[02:35:40.700 --> 02:35:42.660]   you have to turn those on like an hour ahead of time
[02:35:42.660 --> 02:35:44.660]   before the lava starts flowing.
[02:35:44.660 --> 02:35:45.100]   It's like--
[02:35:45.100 --> 02:35:45.460]   It's true.
[02:35:45.460 --> 02:35:46.620]   Way before the party starts.
[02:35:46.620 --> 02:35:47.380]   Way before that.
[02:35:47.380 --> 02:35:48.380]   I learned that, right?
[02:35:48.380 --> 02:35:51.700]   The party was over and the lava was still stuck.
[02:35:51.700 --> 02:35:54.980]   I should have asked Laurie Gill and I'm more.com,
[02:35:54.980 --> 02:35:57.540]   managing editor over there, regular on Mac Break Weekly.
[02:35:57.540 --> 02:36:00.540]   Have we talked you out, or will you come back Tuesday?
[02:36:00.540 --> 02:36:01.060]   Oh, yeah.
[02:36:01.060 --> 02:36:01.820]   Oh, no.
[02:36:01.820 --> 02:36:02.780]   I'm not coming back Tuesday.
[02:36:02.780 --> 02:36:03.620]   Oh, you got the day off?
[02:36:03.620 --> 02:36:05.340]   I'm-- yeah, I'm taking that day off.
[02:36:05.340 --> 02:36:06.620]   Rotating out?
[02:36:06.620 --> 02:36:07.300]   Good.
[02:36:07.300 --> 02:36:07.700]   Good.
[02:36:07.700 --> 02:36:09.700]   You got to speak your piece.
[02:36:09.700 --> 02:36:10.580]   Yeah.
[02:36:10.580 --> 02:36:12.700]   Well, we will see you a week from Tuesday then.
[02:36:12.700 --> 02:36:13.340]   Yes.
[02:36:13.340 --> 02:36:15.500]   Have a happy 4th of July, everybody.
[02:36:15.500 --> 02:36:16.900]   Independence Day is next Saturday,
[02:36:16.900 --> 02:36:19.820]   but we will be back a week from today
[02:36:19.820 --> 02:36:23.140]   on the July 5th with another--
[02:36:23.140 --> 02:36:25.220]   I hope more thrilling and gripping edition
[02:36:25.220 --> 02:36:30.020]   for those of you who ate apple this week in a tech.
[02:36:30.020 --> 02:36:32.020]   Do I do this every year, Jason?
[02:36:32.020 --> 02:36:32.540]   I bet I do.
[02:36:32.540 --> 02:36:33.020]   I apologize.
[02:36:33.020 --> 02:36:33.540]   Yeah, you do.
[02:36:33.540 --> 02:36:34.380]   Yeah.
[02:36:34.380 --> 02:36:36.460]   I guess I should have known.
[02:36:36.460 --> 02:36:38.660]   I should have expected this.
[02:36:38.660 --> 02:36:40.700]   You could warn people the week ahead of time.
[02:36:40.700 --> 02:36:42.700]   Next week, we're going to talk about apple.
[02:36:42.700 --> 02:36:43.100]   Next week, it's just--
[02:36:43.100 --> 02:36:43.820]   I don't like it.
[02:36:43.820 --> 02:36:48.020]   You know, honestly, I knew that we would be talking about apple
[02:36:48.020 --> 02:36:48.740]   WWDC.
[02:36:48.740 --> 02:36:51.420]   I didn't really anticipate, in hindsight,
[02:36:51.420 --> 02:36:55.420]   I should have known what a big deal this transition apple
[02:36:55.420 --> 02:36:56.020]   silicon is.
[02:36:56.020 --> 02:36:58.220]   I think there's really fascinating.
[02:36:58.220 --> 02:37:00.140]   I even think what they're doing on an iPhone and iPad.
[02:37:00.140 --> 02:37:02.420]   We didn't mention Scribble on iPad OS,
[02:37:02.420 --> 02:37:05.900]   bringing the Newton back baby.
[02:37:05.900 --> 02:37:07.260]   But there's a lot.
[02:37:07.260 --> 02:37:07.780]   There's a lot.
[02:37:07.780 --> 02:37:10.420]   But we'll talk about it again on Tuesday, iOS today,
[02:37:10.420 --> 02:37:11.980]   on Tuesday as well.
[02:37:11.980 --> 02:37:14.220]   We do Twitch this week in tech, our show,
[02:37:14.220 --> 02:37:16.340]   the one you just watched, the one you just slept through.
[02:37:16.340 --> 02:37:17.980]   We do this.
[02:37:17.980 --> 02:37:18.580]   Wake up.
[02:37:18.580 --> 02:37:19.700]   Hello.
[02:37:19.700 --> 02:37:20.580]   I'm still here.
[02:37:20.580 --> 02:37:21.300]   What?
[02:37:21.300 --> 02:37:22.780]   It's 2020 over yet.
[02:37:22.780 --> 02:37:23.100]   Nope.
[02:37:23.100 --> 02:37:24.380]   Go back to sleep.
[02:37:24.380 --> 02:37:27.900]   We do this week in tech every Sunday afternoon about--
[02:37:27.900 --> 02:37:29.900]   oh, I'd say it varies.
[02:37:29.900 --> 02:37:34.700]   About 230 Pacific, 530 Eastern, 2130 UTC.
[02:37:34.700 --> 02:37:36.180]   You can watch or listen live.
[02:37:36.180 --> 02:37:38.660]   Our live stream is at twit.tv/live.
[02:37:38.660 --> 02:37:41.100]   You can also pick up on-demand versions
[02:37:41.100 --> 02:37:44.060]   of the website, twit.tv.
[02:37:44.060 --> 02:37:44.860]   It's on YouTube.
[02:37:44.860 --> 02:37:47.380]   But my favorite way for you to get it is to subscribe.
[02:37:47.380 --> 02:37:49.620]   Get your favorite podcast application.
[02:37:49.620 --> 02:37:50.860]   Search for Twit.
[02:37:50.860 --> 02:37:51.420]   Find it.
[02:37:51.420 --> 02:37:52.060]   Subscribe.

[02:37:55.780 --> 02:37:58.740]   for your Monday morning commute from the refrigerator
[02:37:58.740 --> 02:37:59.300]   to the couch.
[02:37:59.300 --> 02:38:05.540]   At that rate, it'll take you a year to listen to the show.
[02:38:05.540 --> 02:38:06.220]   Thanks, Laurie.
[02:38:06.220 --> 02:38:06.940]   Thanks, Jason.
[02:38:06.940 --> 02:38:07.580]   Thanks, Dan.
[02:38:07.580 --> 02:38:08.580]   Thank you all for listening.
[02:38:08.580 --> 02:38:10.500]   Another twit is in the can.
