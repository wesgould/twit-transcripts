[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   >> Yes, a little bit of a break from life tech.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   >> You can give us the perspective, the Indian's perspective
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   on tech.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   Although you were saying that where you are in Northern
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   India, wasn't that wired?
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   >> Not really.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   I mean, sometimes you would see people on the trains using
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   laptops and stuff like that.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   The cyber cafe is still very, very popular.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   >> That's where people go.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   >> And that's where, I mean, having a home computer is not
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   something that's widespread other than the metros.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   In other cities, not as much.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   >> The Internet Cafe.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   That's kind of like that in other parts of the world, I think.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   >> I think so too.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   When I was in China, I saw some Internet cafes there, but they
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   weren't as frequent.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   I didn't see them as frequently as I did in India.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   So, you know, but it was interesting because I'm one of
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   those people that wakes up and gets on their computer and is
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   just glued to it the entire day.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   I'm sure a lot of you are the same way.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   So in India, I wasn't able to do that.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   And it was just interesting to go outside, get some fresh air
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   and interact with real people.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.000]   >> Very cool.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   >> Speaking of fresh air and real people from Oxford,
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   England, our good buddy, Mr. Wilhaer, it's a long time.
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   No, see, he's got a little glass of suns there.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Hey, Will.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Oh, no, he's lost his audio.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:19.000]   >> On "Muteth" thyself.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   >> Ah!
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   >> Sorry.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   >> It's great to be here.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   >> It's great now that I can see you.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   >> I'm out of practice.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   >> I can see you via Skype-asaurus.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   Not only do I know you're speaking or not hearing, but I can
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   see what you're drinking and when.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   >> All the way through.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   >> John won't let us do that.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   Also hear from Port Angeles in the northern western most poor
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   of the United States of America for the continental U.S.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   John C. Duvoirach.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   >> Hey there.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   >> Great to have you.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   How was your Easter?
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   >> It's still going on.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   >> Did you hide eggs for the little ones?
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   >> We don't actually have any little ones, but we did hide eggs
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   in the course.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   Now the eggs have money in them.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   >> Oh, that gets the kids going.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   >> So everybody's glad to participate.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   >> Gold coins.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   The leprechauns have been here.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Wow.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   That's a great idea.
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   I was trying to hide eggs for my kid, my 14-year-old.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   I said, "Henry, can I hide some eggs?"
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   He said, "No."
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   >> Put a couple bucks in each one or five versions.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   You'll see he'll change his song.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   >> You came up with a very good idea.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   People like how John sounds when he is in Port Angeles when he's
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   up in Washington State and the reason is John?
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   >> Because I'm using the fabulous PR40 from Ohio.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   >> The Ohio PR40?
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   Isn't it warm and luscious and delicious?
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   >> What I like about it is that, in fact, I think people should
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   consider this when they're podcasting.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   It's not a condensed -- so that saves you typically $100 for a
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   little preamp, and it doesn't need a compressor.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   So essentially, you saved like $200 right off the top for a
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   least.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   I mean, you could really rack those numbers up if you want to.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   And the mic, I think, is around $400.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   So it's the equivalent of a $200 expense overall as opposed to,
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   and the mic I usually use in AKG cost about the same, but I need
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   these two pieces of equipment.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   >> Yeah, no, I like it.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   >> So it's easier.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   >> It's way to go.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   So how do you get -- I don't understand, though.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   You're getting the -- because it isn't a normal mic in the
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   sense that it -- I mean, it's a professional mic.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   So you just can plug it in right into the side?
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   >> No, no, I have an M audio.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   >> You still using an M audio?
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   >> Yeah, I just bought a second one for up here.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   And the funny thing is, I decided to get it online so I
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   scrounged around, and I found some source.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   I mean, these things cost about, I think, about $150 or something
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   like that.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   And so I found a source that they were like $49.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   >> Wow.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   >> Some say, you're refurbished, they say.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   So I get the thing, and it's exactly the same.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Exactly.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   And it looks like it's never been used or touched, and it's
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   going to be some of these big labels on the box saying, "Be
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   stock."
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   You know, not for retail or something like that.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   And so if you -- I'm happy with it.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   So it's exactly the same as the other one.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   >> You know, I think we can thank -- I don't know if it was a
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   California state legislature or the courts for this because
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   Dell, I think it was, was selling computers that had been
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   returned.
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   You know, if somebody bought it and opened the box and didn't
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   want it and returned it as new.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   And somebody sued, and the court said, "No, you can't
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   sell that stuff as new."
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   And as a result, all these companies have to sell this
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   stuff that isn't really used, it's just returned or boxes
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   opened, they can't sell it as new.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   And so they -- we get this great benefit, although for 50
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   bucks is a big cut.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   I mean, most of the companies, Dell sells this stuff and
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   doesn't give you that kind of a break.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   >> No, this -- and I have to recommend this thing.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   I mean, people, when I first started working over in
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Mevio to get up to speed on all this stuff, I remember -- and
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   this was like a couple of years ago, I remember everybody
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   saying, "No, no, you can't use the USB, you can't go through it
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   under any circumstances, it sucks.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   You have to somehow go through -- this is what this does."
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   And I think it sounds just as good as anything I've heard.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   >> It's totally digital, I agree.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   It's really a question whether you got good mic
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   preamps and that thing, and I think it has good mic
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   preamps.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   We're using it to send my audio to you, and we use an M
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   audio slightly higher in M audio, just because that's what
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   they had in stock, and your audio is coming out that way, so
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   it works fine.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   >> So you brought up -- Will Harris, you brought up the
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   first story of the day.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   And a surprising story, the guys who created Skype, which we
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   used to do this show, you're on Skype, John's on Skype.
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   >> And you make it look like Will Harris is John C.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   Devorak.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   >> I know, I have to type a new lower third for him.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   >> I'm just saying.
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   >> Now that John's watching the video, he's not so nice.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   [laughter]
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   >> Everyone's critical.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   >> And everyone's critical.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   [laughter]
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   >> They want to buy Skype back?
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   What's the story there?
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   >> So, well, according to the New York Times, anyway,
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Nicholas sent from a Nianos Fris, who are the guys that
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   actually started Skype, of course, sold it to eBay for,
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   gosh, what, like, two and a half billion?
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   >> It ended up being 3.1 billion after all was said and done, yeah.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   >> And then, and now, you know, eBay has kind of originally
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   bought it, I think, to integrate it with eBay, so you could chat
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   to your dealers and sellers, et cetera.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   Never really sort of did it.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   It's costing them stupendous amounts of money,
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   allegedly, to keep it running.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   >> Yeah, why did they buy them in the first place?
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   It wouldn't mean that's--
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   >> Well, I think what they wanted to do was have it so that if you
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   were on eBay and you wanted to ask a question of your seller,
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   which is like the number one impediment to buying something,
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   is you want to know something, is that you could just easily
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   call someone.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   >> Yeah, and the number one thing sellers didn't want to do is
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   talk to the buyer.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   >> Yeah, actually called their customers, right.
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   So it was a slight disaster, but--
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   >> [LAUGH]
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   >> So they're now looking to buy it back, and eBay, you know,
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   according to this story, analysts say that eBay is looking for
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   1.7 billion.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   So they're looking to get back half their money.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   >> Oh, man.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   >> Wow.
[00:09:02.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   >> They want a lot of money for it.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   They're not going to let it go.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   >> However, you know, saying that at 1.7 billion,
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   that's the value of Skype on the eBay balance sheet in 2007.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   So you've got to imagine that the difference between the price
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   in 2007 and the price today in the current market is going to be
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   looking a little bit different.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   These guys could get it back for less than a billion.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:26.000]   I'm probably flipping it again in another 3, 2, or 3 years.
[00:09:26.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   >> Boy, talk about profit.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   And they're going to have a $2 billion profit out of this there,
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   $1.5 billion profit out of this thing.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   >> I wonder, I mean, their new project,
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   or their semi-new project, I mean, it seems to be doing okay.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   >> There's no money in that.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   Do you think there is?
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   >> No, I don't think there's money in it, but I think that, you know,
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   they have good partnerships with networks and things like that.
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   And they have some decent content on there.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   >> Right.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   >> I wonder what their model is for making money on that, do they?
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   >> Well, the model for making money is always on juice.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:59.000]   There's always been ads in the content and then rev share.
[00:09:59.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   >> Yeah, I think they have pre-roll, if I'm not.
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   >> Yeah, they do pre-roll and hopefully not kind of thing.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   And they want to monetize the community to start generating chat
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   around TV and then to start monetizing that kind of community.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   Actually, they've kind of gone to nowhere.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   It's kind of an open secret that nobody's buying ads.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   The content is all the kind of stuff you can get everywhere else
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   for free anyway.
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   >> It's kind of junk.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   >> They had like Duke's a hazard quality.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   I mean, it's not.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   >> Yeah, and they had, you know, the desktop client that was supposed to be
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   the future of TV, but nobody really wanted a desktop client.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   And so they changed it to Flash, but then they've had to go and
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   raise hundreds more, you know, millions of dollars to keep the thing going.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   And I think most people can see it tanking very quickly.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   >> And when it comes to that model, I think Hulu just has it going on.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   I mean, a lot of people really like Hulu.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   I like Hulu.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   >> I would bet Hulu's not making money either, though.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   I don't know.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   >> And you say that, but of course Hulu isn't actually available
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   anywhere inside of the United States.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   >> That's a good question.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   >> To watch any content of any sort.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   >> It's just as international.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   >> Of course, you know a little bit about this, Will, because as the guy who
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   runs Channel Flip, you're trying to make money in IPTV as well.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   >> Absolutely.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   >> Do you see Juices as a competitor?
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   >> Not really.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   You know, Juiced come and sort of ask us for our content.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   And the general line is, you know, well, how much is it going to be worth?
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   And the general line is, you know, we might be able to pay you a few dollars
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   every month, which is, you know, absolutely ridiculous.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   So we don't really see them as a competitor at all.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   You know, they're not making any content.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:30.000]   And that's what it's all about in the current day and age.
[00:11:30.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   As you well know, it's all about making the stuff.
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   >> Jamie's saying in our friend feed conversation that he believes Hulu is
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   making money.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   Do you think so?
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   Well, I mean, you know what it would take to make money in that way.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   >> Oh, for sure.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   >> You think they're making money?
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   >> So the reason Hulu can make money is because they're basically selling ads
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   on what's already like a sunk cost.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   >> That's a good point.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   The only cost to them at this point is bandwidth.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   >> Right.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   So the cost of making the content is like zero to go online because they've
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   already sunk that cost for TV.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   So anything they can make out of it online is just covering bandwidth and
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   making profit.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   >> It's incremental profit.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   Now, whether you can maintain that going forward when there's less money in
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   TV budgets is a kind of different question.
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   >> I mean, I love Hulu, but I have to say, I don't know how many ads.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   I mean, there's not a lot of ads in there.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   >> Well, there's, again, I mean, with every show that you watch, there is the 30-
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   >> There's enough.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   >> And it's the 30-second pre-roll.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   And I've even seen, I think they also employ mid-roll too.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   >> Yeah, they do.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   They're like their new stitch-alikes.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   >> Yeah.
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   So I mean, I would almost say that it's heavily advertised.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   >> Compared to other--
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   >> Compared to other networks that are doing content.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   >> Will, is that--how is the ad sales going on channel flip?
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   Are people buying--
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   >> Yeah, it's really interesting.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   I mean, without getting sort of two inside baseball, it's really interesting that, you
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   know, TV spend in the UK is down drastically.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   Online spend is up drastically.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   And in particular, you know, online video is really the only area where the market is holding
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   up.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   >> That's been our experience too, our advertising.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   We can't--
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   >> You know, I think--
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   >> Place it on.
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   >> You know, what you see is that, you know, generic media, those sort of MSNs of the world,
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   see their CPMs tanking because you have no idea who the audience is.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   But where you can connect with a specialist audience and you know who that audience is,
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   you know, with your podcast, you know all the kind of people that are going to be listening
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   to this, you know, all the demo every day that you do all the surveys.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   And that audience is really, really valuable.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   Whereas, you know, generic 10 million people turn up to MSN.
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   It's like, well, who the hell are these people?
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.000]   >> We're going to come back in just a bit and talk more about Hitter's been--Hitter's
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   been twacked.
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   I mean, Twacker's been hit.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   I shouldn't have had that wine before the show.
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   Twitter has been hacked twice by the same Brooklyn kid who says, "Yeah, I did it.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:55.000]   It was me.
[00:13:55.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   I was the guy."
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   You know, we kind of knew because he sent everybody to his site.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   We'll talk about that in just a little bit.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   Also, they're closing the pub on the Microsoft campus and the employees are getting together
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   to save it.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   Before we do that though, I want to mention our friends at audible.com.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   Audible is a great place to go to get your audio entertainment.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   You love podcasts.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   You've got to loveaudible.com.

[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   It's the world's greatest library of audio books.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:27.000]   I think it doesn't mean it's service to say audio books.
[00:14:27.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   Audible is really--these are performances.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   Some of the best readers reading some of the most amazing literature.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:40.000]   It is a wonderful resource you can learn while you're doing things that normally be completely
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   time wasted, like sitting in the car driving, going to the gym, working out.
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   Give it a try right now.
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   You get the Audible Platinum account by going to audible.com/twit-twit.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   When you sign up for a platinum, that's what I have.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   You get two books a month.
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   I go through two books a month, so I need that.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   You could choose from any of the books here.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   Some of the books are two credits, but it's an amazing thing.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   Since we're eating wine, I'm drinking wine right now.
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:13.000]   I think we should be talking about a little bit about food.
[00:15:13.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   I'm going to recommend a wonderful book.
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   Actually, this is a TV program.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   Have you ever seen this splendid table?
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   They have TV shows on here too.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   The audio from the TV shows.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   This is Lynn Rosetta Kasper's incredible TV show.
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   This is the one where she interviews the author of Julie and Julia, 365 days, 524 recipes,
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   and one tiny apartment.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   This is--I actually going to recommend that book because we've recommended it before on jumping monkeys.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   But what a story.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   This is a woman who ended up deciding to cook every recipe in Julia Child's famous,
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   the art of French cooking.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   524 recipes in one year, and it's her story of doing that.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   These are just an example.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   I mean, it's everything from soup to nuts.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:11.000]   I mean, you can business, classics, education, fiction, history, young adults.
[00:16:11.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   It's great for the kids, mysteries, thrillers, even romance.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   Lots of science and technology and sci-fi and fantasy titles.
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   I want you to try it right now.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   Go to audible.com/twit2, sign up for the platinum account.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   You're going to love it.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   Audible.com/twit2, we thank you so much for their support of this week in tech.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   There's an example of an advertiser that just can't get enough of podcasts.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   They're buying a lot of podcasts.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   They supported us now.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   They're our second year of advertising with them.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   I think it's what you said.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   It's almost a contrarian market.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:54.000]   We're doing better than we did when the economy was good.
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.000]   Exactly.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   Everybody likes a good bit of specific advertising.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   You know, when you guys are talking about audible, it's really useful.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   I've got a platinum plan which I signed up for through this.
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:06.000]   That's right.
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   I know that.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   Yeah, of course.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   That's awesome.
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   Very cool.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   I'm listening to a little Terry Pratchett.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   I met Terry Pratchett last week.
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   You did?
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   Back into it.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   Oh, so jealous.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   Terry Pratchett wrote the Discworld books.
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   He is one of the best funniest fantasy writers.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   Huge fan suffering from Alzheimer's.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   Terrible.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   Terrible.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:27.000]   But still very, still very with it.
[00:17:27.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   I'm going to horrendously name drop.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   Bing.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   I'm just going to go that well out at the exclusive screening of the new Red Dwarf last week.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   He turned up.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   Bobby Llewellins was there.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   Did you say hi to Bobby Llewellins?
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   Absolutely.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:42.000]   I got in on his ticket.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   Congratulations.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   You congratulate him on the relaunch of Red Dwarf.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   That's such a good news.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   Fantastic job, I thought.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   Really?
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   I haven't seen it here yet.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   Nah, I hear you can get it.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   I have to get on the ball and start downloading somewhere I'll find it.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   That is great.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:06.000]   So how was Sir Terry Pratchett?
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:08.600]   Very well, he was giving Red carpet interviews all night.
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:12.000]   Even though it was nothing to do with him, he sort of turned up I think and saw this sort
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.640]   of Red carpet where the camera crew's room was like, "Ah, Red carpet, I must need to be
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:17.640]   on that."
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:18.640]   I'm Terry Pratchett.
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:23.120]   I am particularly spending the whole evening giving interviews and things, which is fantastic.
[00:18:23.120 --> 00:18:28.920]   I saw a weird article about him and some helmet that he's a brain helmet that he's wearing.
[00:18:28.920 --> 00:18:29.920]   Did you see this?
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:30.920]   The magic light helmet?
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:33.000]   That he's hoping it will let him right?
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   Because despite the Alzheimer's, he's still riding, but he says it's very slow going.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:41.520]   He might write a sentence a day.
[00:18:41.520 --> 00:18:47.040]   So he's using this bizarre light helmet that Dr. Gordon Dougal invented it and it's supposed
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:49.160]   to slow Alzheimer's.
[00:18:49.160 --> 00:18:52.000]   I think it sounds pretty warm.
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.640]   Well, listen, if you listen as a Jonesy, he's prepared to Pratchett.
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:59.440]   Audible has a great selection of Pratchett that's read by a guy called Nigel Planer.
[00:18:59.440 --> 00:19:00.440]   Yes.
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:03.800]   He's a very famous being in the Young Ones, which was a seminal British comedy of the
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:04.800]   '80s.
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:05.800]   Did you know that?
[00:19:05.800 --> 00:19:09.240]   Nigel Planer does a very, very good disco book.
[00:19:09.240 --> 00:19:10.240]   There's the light helmet.
[00:19:10.240 --> 00:19:11.240]   You know what?
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:12.240]   This is a joke.
[00:19:12.240 --> 00:19:15.720]   It's got three muffin fans from a laptop computer on it.
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:18.200]   It looks absolutely insane.
[00:19:18.200 --> 00:19:20.200]   But anything that helps Terry, right?
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:21.200]   I'm all for you.
[00:19:21.200 --> 00:19:26.520]   Yeah, I listened to, in fact, I have a dozen Audible Discworld books.
[00:19:26.520 --> 00:19:28.200]   The first one's on there, the color of magic.
[00:19:28.200 --> 00:19:29.440]   That's the one you should start with.
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:30.400]   Yeah.
[00:19:30.400 --> 00:19:33.400]   And I love that stuff.
[00:19:33.400 --> 00:19:35.960]   And also, Mort is my favorite, actually.
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:36.960]   A lot more.
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:38.960]   The introduction of Death and such.
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:43.320]   But I like Rinse Wind because he's kind of, he's like a Merlin, but he's completely inept
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:46.120]   and terrified and goofy and it's just great.
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:48.440]   He's like a bad, bad wizard.
[00:19:48.440 --> 00:19:50.080]   Like a wizard is no good.
[00:19:50.080 --> 00:19:51.920]   And he just sucks.
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.560]   Incompetent wizard.
[00:19:54.560 --> 00:20:00.200]   Let's talk a little bit about, I don't know.
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:05.360]   I'm kind of sandbagging you with this because this story just came out.
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:13.720]   The Spitfire Club was going to open on Microsoft's entertainment and devices division campus.
[00:20:13.720 --> 00:20:21.040]   They were going to open a pub and for Microsofties to go to, I guess because they're afraid
[00:20:21.040 --> 00:20:23.880]   of going out in the real world, I don't know.
[00:20:23.880 --> 00:20:26.520]   And they pulled the plug on the project.
[00:20:26.520 --> 00:20:31.560]   The owner, Jonathan Sposato says, "I'm completely stunned and disappointed by the decision.
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:34.120]   I'm confused by the sudden change of heart."
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:38.040]   Spitfire, apparently, is a pub also in Seattle's Belltown neighborhood.
[00:20:38.040 --> 00:20:39.040]   Ever been there, John?
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:40.040]   The Spitfire pub?
[00:20:40.040 --> 00:20:41.040]   No, never.
[00:20:41.040 --> 00:20:44.680]   Is this a good idea to have a pub on the campus at Microsoft?
[00:20:44.680 --> 00:20:46.640]   See, companies do this so you'll never leave.
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:47.640]   I think yes.
[00:20:47.640 --> 00:20:48.640]   Yeah.
[00:20:48.640 --> 00:20:54.560]   When I'm sure a lot of the people who work at Microsoft spend a lot of hours there.
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:57.440]   So it might have been a good idea.
[00:20:57.440 --> 00:20:59.480]   They've been developing this for more than a year.
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:02.600]   There was a competitive bidding process just weeks before it was opened.
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:03.600]   He had a fire.
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:06.880]   The 22 employees he'd hired.
[00:21:06.880 --> 00:21:07.880]   That's crazy.
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:11.080]   I find it bizarre that Microsoft can have a gun club, but not a pub.
[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:12.600]   They have a gun club?
[00:21:12.600 --> 00:21:19.160]   Well, apparently, there's a video on YouTube that has Microsoft Gun Club April 2009, from
[00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:21.200]   their second amendment day.
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:26.200]   Hey, Microsoft.
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:28.480]   So here's a piece of news that's kind of interesting.
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.680]   That's not being under-covered.
[00:21:29.680 --> 00:21:30.680]   Yes, sir.
[00:21:30.680 --> 00:21:35.720]   You know, these cables have been clipped down in the San Jose area.
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:38.080]   Yes, this was sabotage.
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:41.000]   And so I did a call-em-and-market watch on this.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:45.040]   And then I got a note from someone saying South Carolina also had a similar situation.
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:46.840]   None of this has been reported.
[00:21:46.840 --> 00:21:56.360]   And then Eric, our channel, the Vorak, Eric, my son, he mentions that there was apparently
[00:21:56.360 --> 00:22:01.840]   a clip between Washington, D.C. and some, I guess, some part of Virginia.
[00:22:01.840 --> 00:22:04.120]   And so it looks like there's somebody's out there.
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:05.640]   I have a theory on this.
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:08.200]   To see what the results are, I guess.
[00:22:08.200 --> 00:22:09.960]   I have a theory on this.
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:15.760]   So for those who didn't know, because it was kind of a local story, San Jose, South Bay,
[00:22:15.760 --> 00:22:21.880]   the Silicon Valley's phone service, including cell service, completely died, was out for
[00:22:21.880 --> 00:22:24.880]   most of the day, tens of thousands of people without any service.
[00:22:24.880 --> 00:22:26.880]   50,000, actually.
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:29.960]   They discovered that it was intentional sabotage.
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:30.960]   But get this.
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:32.200]   This is where the fiber cables are.
[00:22:32.200 --> 00:22:36.760]   The person would have had an open, move a fairly hefty manhole cover.
[00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:38.720]   They would, first, they'd have to know where they're going, right?
[00:22:38.720 --> 00:22:40.160]   I mean, there's a lot of manhole covers.
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:42.400]   They move the right manhole cover, climb down.
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:46.120]   It's about two feet of water that'd be standing in.
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:50.400]   They'd have to know which cables to cut.
[00:22:50.400 --> 00:22:51.400]   And they did.
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:53.080]   They did all of that.
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:55.760]   This is not just random vandalism.
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:56.760]   Right.
[00:22:56.760 --> 00:23:01.120]   So I bet you think in the same thing, I'm thinking, John C. Devorah.
[00:23:01.120 --> 00:23:02.120]   What?
[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:03.120]   Terrorists.
[00:23:03.120 --> 00:23:07.760]   Well, I wasn't, I, yeah, that's what I was thinking, actually.
[00:23:07.760 --> 00:23:13.160]   But the, it seems like, I don't know, we kind of terrorists, it would be, I mean, it could
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:15.160]   be blackmailers or extortionists.
[00:23:15.160 --> 00:23:19.040]   Well, first of all, you'd have to know, I mean, this is not, I would not do this.
[00:23:19.040 --> 00:23:20.040]   Non-trivial.
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:21.040]   Non-trivial.
[00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:23.000]   You say you'd have- Why would you do it though?
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:24.720]   I think it's a rehearing- What's the benefit?
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:25.720]   It's a rehearsal.
[00:23:25.720 --> 00:23:29.200]   It's the same reason the bad guys put software on the electrical grid.
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:31.240]   We discovered this last week.
[00:23:31.240 --> 00:23:36.840]   Wall Street Journal published a big story saying, you know, there's software designed
[00:23:36.840 --> 00:23:41.080]   to shut down the electrical grid on many computers on an electrical grid and never used.
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:42.800]   It's sitting there.
[00:23:42.800 --> 00:23:47.600]   So my theory is if you're, look, if you're bad guys, if you're either terrorists or foreign
[00:23:47.600 --> 00:23:52.640]   nationals and you, and you're planning, you know, warfare, you need to know how this stuff
[00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:53.640]   works.
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:54.640]   What you do is you try it out.
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:56.160]   You do a rehearsal.
[00:23:56.160 --> 00:23:58.520]   You see if it works.
[00:23:58.520 --> 00:24:02.440]   And, and you know, you hope that it's three isolated incidents that nobody's going to put
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:03.440]   two and two together.
[00:24:03.440 --> 00:24:06.760]   You got to hope that I hope the Department of Homeland Security is at least as smart
[00:24:06.760 --> 00:24:09.560]   as John C. de Vorek.
[00:24:09.560 --> 00:24:10.800]   But I think that's what's going on.
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:11.800]   Why?
[00:24:11.800 --> 00:24:12.800]   I mean, who else would be doing this?
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:13.800]   You think it's blackmail, John?
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:18.120]   Well, I mean, there's, there are extortionists out there that pull this kind of thing.
[00:24:18.120 --> 00:24:21.320]   And you know, they do it with oil refineries.
[00:24:21.320 --> 00:24:24.560]   They do it all, you know, we're going to do this and that if you don't give us money.
[00:24:24.560 --> 00:24:27.640]   Although, you know, and we're probably would never find out if that was the case because
[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:33.840]   who the heck is going to tell us that, you know, somebody paid somebody off, you know,
[00:24:33.840 --> 00:24:34.920]   in the situation like this.
[00:24:34.920 --> 00:24:35.920]   I'm not sure.
[00:24:35.920 --> 00:24:36.920]   What what?
[00:24:36.920 --> 00:24:37.920]   Yeah, we don't know.
[00:24:37.920 --> 00:24:38.920]   I guess it could, you know what?
[00:24:38.920 --> 00:24:43.560]   The things I'd like to get a call out, anybody has any if this is anybody sees this happening
[00:24:43.560 --> 00:24:44.560]   anyplace else in the country.
[00:24:44.560 --> 00:24:49.960]   I think these are all typically locally reported and nobody seeing it as a national story.
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:51.360]   I mean, I did write it up in market.
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:54.800]   Watch is what I thought was a national story is a national story.
[00:24:54.800 --> 00:24:58.760]   And the fact that they were able to cut this fiber, they knew where to go.
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:24:59.760]   They were able to.
[00:24:59.760 --> 00:25:03.480]   Well, I also pointed out the fact that like, for example, we have a lot of fiber up here
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:04.920]   and it's very clearly marked.
[00:25:04.920 --> 00:25:08.880]   I mean, cut here to disconnect phone service.
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:12.200]   Well, I know that they tell you where the cable is because they don't want people with
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.280]   backhoe is ripping it out.
[00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:17.960]   And so, you know, we can it's not doesn't take a genius to find this stuff.
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:22.600]   The outage affected some cell phones, internet access and about 52,200 Verizon household
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:28.360]   landlines in Santa Cruz and San Jose counties.
[00:25:28.360 --> 00:25:33.160]   Cell phone networks by Verizon next on sprint and some AT&T networks were also out.
[00:25:33.160 --> 00:25:39.400]   I mean, this pretty effective was a little too easy if you asked me.
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:42.440]   Yeah, I think that's really what the problem is.
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:44.720]   And I think it's, yeah, I think people.
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:48.280]   ATM's knocked out.
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:52.800]   San Jose, St. Louis Regional Hospital and Gilway cancel elective surgeries.
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:25:53.800]   Wow.
[00:25:53.800 --> 00:25:57.360]   I mean, it's a big deal when this kind of thing happens.
[00:25:57.360 --> 00:26:02.280]   I think it can be devastating to any community when something like this goes down and people
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:11.640]   don't understand the magnitude of how important it is to address these things.
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:17.760]   You know, there's I think people see this not as a direct act of maybe something like
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:23.560]   terrorism and therefore they don't address it as that or as a major issue.
[00:26:23.560 --> 00:26:27.880]   Well, I think I hope John that you hear from somebody because I think that this certainly
[00:26:27.880 --> 00:26:30.800]   raises that specter.
[00:26:30.800 --> 00:26:33.440]   And I wouldn't be surprised if there's some other outages here and there that we just
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:36.040]   haven't been reported because it's always seen as a local thing.
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:44.800]   But I mean, the idea would be just guessing that you'd want to take a kind of map the
[00:26:44.800 --> 00:26:49.800]   fiber network, see which are important and find ones that intersect or in other words,
[00:26:49.800 --> 00:26:54.160]   you'd have a whole area that could possibly be blacked out like a whole city or let's
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:27:00.760]   say by two cuts someplace because everything's, you know, the network is not so, I mean,
[00:27:00.760 --> 00:27:03.720]   it used to be well, the internet's supposed to be redundant, you know, when I was designed
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:06.040]   for taking a bomb and all this stuff.
[00:27:06.040 --> 00:27:07.040]   That's not true anymore.
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:09.600]   I don't know if it was ever true, but it's not true.
[00:27:09.600 --> 00:27:13.960]   I've gained out of an ever true, but whatever the cases is not that redundant.
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:14.960]   Yeah.
[00:27:14.960 --> 00:27:15.960]   No kidding.
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:19.120]   If you can knock it out, like clip it a couple of things.
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:24.320]   Speaking of bad actors, Mikey Mooney is a name you might want to keep in mind.
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:27.560]   Mikey with two whys, he's 17 years old.
[00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:32.440]   He has a little website called stock daily.com STA LK.
[00:27:32.440 --> 00:27:33.440]   Don't go there.
[00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:34.440]   Don't go there.
[00:27:34.440 --> 00:27:36.600]   Don't go there.
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:43.960]   He created a cross site scripting exploit that took advantage of a flaw in Twitter.
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:46.480]   How many flaws are they going to be in Twitter?
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:50.920]   How complicated is Twitter and why is it that it keeps getting hacked?
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:52.440]   Why do they keep adding weird stuff?
[00:27:52.440 --> 00:27:56.480]   Not only when you tweet something, you get a drop down that says your thing has been
[00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:58.280]   updated and it goes back up.
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:00.960]   I haven't seen that because I haven't used Twitter in a while.
[00:28:00.960 --> 00:28:02.360]   I'm ready to eat Twitter.
[00:28:02.360 --> 00:28:03.360]   I hate it.
[00:28:03.360 --> 00:28:05.720]   I mean, it's been a little wonky.
[00:28:05.720 --> 00:28:06.720]   It's really wonky.
[00:28:06.720 --> 00:28:09.320]   Fail whales and over.
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:11.400]   I get a lot of over capacity.
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:12.800]   Twitter is a little capacity.
[00:28:12.800 --> 00:28:14.480]   Well, that's of course.
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:18.640]   I mean, it happens, but it can be really frustrating too.
[00:28:18.640 --> 00:28:20.000]   It's what's his name?
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   Ashton Kutcher.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:23.200]   It's the Ashton Kutcher phenomenon.
[00:28:23.200 --> 00:28:25.000]   Yeah, it's really weird to hear about Twitter and popular.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:27.200]   Getting pictures of Demimos, but...
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:30.800]   Yeah, that'll bring a sight down.
[00:28:30.800 --> 00:28:32.400]   The Ashton Kutcher effect.
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.440]   It's the A+K effect.
[00:28:34.440 --> 00:28:43.800]   So this guy, Mikey, says, "I am aware of the attack, and yes, I am behind the attack."
[00:28:43.800 --> 00:28:46.960]   Mikey described how he carried it out to, I think it was to see him.
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:48.360]   Do you think that's his voice?
[00:28:48.360 --> 00:28:50.760]   Well, what do you think his voice sounds like?
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:52.680]   I don't think it sounds like it's his voice.
[00:28:52.680 --> 00:28:53.680]   I think he's got a bunch of voices.
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:57.040]   He's 17, so the voice must have dropped by now.
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:28:58.960]   I think Mikey doesn't get out much.
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:02.000]   I think Mikey is a fine citizen.
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   You're just berating him for no good reason.
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.160]   Mikey, Leo, you're not aware of him.
[00:29:07.160 --> 00:29:09.160]   You just don't want to get hacked, John.
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:11.480]   So wait a minute.
[00:29:11.480 --> 00:29:13.920]   What does Mikey's virus actually do?
[00:29:13.920 --> 00:29:22.800]   Okay, Mikey says, "I am the person who coded the XSS that's across site scripting exploit,
[00:29:22.800 --> 00:29:28.400]   which then acted as a worm when it auto updated a user's profile and status, which
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:31.680]   then infected other users who viewed their profile.
[00:29:31.680 --> 00:29:35.920]   I did this out of boredom, to be honest.
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:40.280]   I usually like to find vulnerabilities within websites and try not to cause too much damage,
[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:46.440]   but start a worm or something to give the developers an insight on the problem.
[00:29:46.440 --> 00:29:51.040]   And while doing so, promoting myself and my website, Mikey not too bright.
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:53.840]   Mikey pointed everybody to his website.
[00:29:53.840 --> 00:29:58.960]   Mikey basically said, "I did it in big red letters."
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:02.120]   Mikey expecting not like the door from the Gatorade.
[00:30:02.120 --> 00:30:03.800]   No, Frank gets more like, "He is.
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:07.480]   He's going to be Professor Frank when he grows up, I think."
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:14.480]   Infected users' passwords were not compromised according to Mikey anyway.
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:19.600]   Although I do notice that Twitter said, "Change your password."
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:20.840]   You might want to change your password.
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:23.920]   That's only if you were affected by it.
[00:30:23.920 --> 00:30:30.680]   And they also suggest killing cookies, clearing your cache, changing your password, and deleting
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:34.680]   all those messages saying, "Go to this site."
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:36.680]   Go to stalkdaily.com.
[00:30:36.680 --> 00:30:37.680]   Doc Calm, right?
[00:30:37.680 --> 00:30:38.680]   What is your favorite case story?
[00:30:38.680 --> 00:30:40.600]   It was the first thing I checked though.
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:41.760]   Did you go to stalkdaily.com?
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:42.760]   No, I didn't.
[00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:46.960]   And thank God, I had no such hacking done.
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:47.960]   James?
[00:30:47.960 --> 00:30:49.720]   And nor did any of my friends that I saw on my feet at least.
[00:30:49.720 --> 00:30:50.720]   I didn't get hacked.
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:57.160]   Isn't this some sort of a felony?
[00:30:57.160 --> 00:30:58.160]   Yeah.
[00:30:58.160 --> 00:30:59.520]   Yeah, that would be it.
[00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:00.520]   A felony.
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:02.240]   It's against the wire.
[00:31:02.240 --> 00:31:05.080]   What if they still have this?
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:07.720]   The wire fraud rules.
[00:31:07.720 --> 00:31:09.920]   I think that's what they use to prosecute people.
[00:31:09.920 --> 00:31:11.560]   They've used that to prosecute people.
[00:31:11.560 --> 00:31:12.560]   Yeah.
[00:31:12.560 --> 00:31:13.960]   Yeah, there's some wire fraud rules.
[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:14.960]   It's kick-shoe-shoe-shoe.
[00:31:14.960 --> 00:31:15.960]   But anyway, what are you going to do?
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:18.960]   Why are you going to get hacked if you actually went into the talk call?
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:19.960]   If you're just using the chat.
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:21.560]   Hold on, hold on one at a time.
[00:31:21.560 --> 00:31:25.440]   You're finished, John, and I'll let you in.
[00:31:25.440 --> 00:31:27.880]   The question is, why would he admit to this?
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:30.080]   Apparently he doesn't know it's a felony, maybe.
[00:31:30.080 --> 00:31:34.120]   But the second thing, the bigger question, and always is the bigger question.
[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:36.520]   Why hasn't somebody knocked on his door?
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:37.960]   There's somebody must have by now.
[00:31:37.960 --> 00:31:39.360]   We know he lives in Brooklyn.
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:40.360]   We know his name.
[00:31:40.360 --> 00:31:41.360]   We know his website.
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:42.360]   Yeah.
[00:31:42.360 --> 00:31:45.520]   There's plenty of information about him.
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:49.400]   He says, "I have run ILoveAds.com."
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:55.320]   Yeah, in fact, he's using the media now to still promote what he's doing.
[00:31:55.320 --> 00:31:56.320]   Yeah.
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:31:57.320]   He hasn't stopped.
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:31:58.320]   No.
[00:31:58.320 --> 00:31:59.320]   Mikey Mooney is still at it.
[00:31:59.320 --> 00:32:03.160]   And of course, our law enforcement is doing what, exactly?
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:07.440]   I hear there were some lines in San Jose that were caught.
[00:32:07.440 --> 00:32:09.280]   I don't know.
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:11.120]   Is that related?
[00:32:11.120 --> 00:32:12.520]   The tweet that you would get.
[00:32:12.520 --> 00:32:13.520]   Here it is.
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:16.520]   Go to stalk daily so you don't have to.
[00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:21.520]   It looks like it's got a picture of Elmer Fudd.
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:24.160]   And here's what he posts on the site.
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:29.600]   "I have came clean and accepted the responsibility for the worm."
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:31.040]   Read the interview here.
[00:32:31.040 --> 00:32:32.120]   I have came clean.
[00:32:32.120 --> 00:32:33.720]   I have came clean.
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:36.720]   He looks like he completely stole the code from Twitter.
[00:32:36.720 --> 00:32:37.720]   Yeah.
[00:32:37.720 --> 00:32:42.120]   It's even got the same, let's see if it's got the Twitter terms of service.
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:45.720]   It basically was, it's like a clone, I think, of Twitter.
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:47.360]   He stole everything.
[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:49.360]   Let's see the privacy.
[00:32:49.360 --> 00:32:51.200]   Stalk daily provides this privacy policy.
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:54.160]   I bet you it's exactly the same as the Twitter privacy policy.
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:32:55.160]   Oh, I'm...
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:33:02.720]   Well, you know, if it's terms of service, require that users of this website accept the worm.
[00:33:02.720 --> 00:33:06.840]   I mean, I think you can get around the felony thing with the terms of service based on the
[00:33:06.840 --> 00:33:08.400]   way case law has been going.
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:09.400]   No.
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:10.400]   That's a particular issue.
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:17.400]   You accept the installation of software on your system to perform any deed whatsoever.
[00:33:17.400 --> 00:33:18.400]   Click here.
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:20.440]   Really, you think you could wave?
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:24.120]   I think the way it's being done, I mean, the way they say, "Well, you know the shrink
[00:33:24.120 --> 00:33:28.840]   wrap law, the terms of service and all this other stuff, the courts uphold it."
[00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:32.560]   So the question is, "Well, what if you put it in the terms of service that you're just
[00:33:32.560 --> 00:33:34.440]   going to hack people?"
[00:33:34.440 --> 00:33:37.920]   So if you use this website, we're allowed to take your credit card number.
[00:33:37.920 --> 00:33:38.920]   Why not?
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:39.920]   Yeah.
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:40.920]   It's...
[00:33:40.920 --> 00:33:42.160]   We could do what I think we want to do.
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:43.160]   Wow.
[00:33:43.160 --> 00:33:45.840]   You think he's that smart that he might have written that in?
[00:33:45.840 --> 00:33:47.840]   I'm always waiting for somebody to do that.
[00:33:47.840 --> 00:33:48.840]   I haven't seen it yet.
[00:33:48.840 --> 00:33:49.840]   Maybe.
[00:33:49.840 --> 00:33:50.840]   Interesting.
[00:33:50.840 --> 00:33:53.440]   I think that the courts would say, "Well, nice try."
[00:33:53.440 --> 00:33:54.440]   But...
[00:33:54.440 --> 00:33:55.440]   All right, let me see.
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:56.440]   Yeah.
[00:33:56.440 --> 00:33:57.440]   He'd probably play up the whole "I'm a kid" thing.
[00:33:57.440 --> 00:33:58.440]   I was just a kid.
[00:33:58.440 --> 00:33:59.440]   I'm a kid.
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:00.440]   It's a harmless worm.
[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:01.440]   I'm 17.
[00:34:01.440 --> 00:34:02.440]   What are you going to do?
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:03.440]   All you have to do is change your password.
[00:34:03.440 --> 00:34:04.440]   I didn't do any real harm.
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:05.440]   Let's see.
[00:34:05.440 --> 00:34:06.440]   First paragraph.
[00:34:06.440 --> 00:34:09.640]   "Stalk daily provides privacy policy to inform users of our policies and procedures regarding
[00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:10.640]   this collection.
[00:34:10.640 --> 00:34:14.880]   Use disclosure of personally identifiable information.
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:17.760]   Stock daily's privacy policy.
[00:34:17.760 --> 00:34:22.080]   Stock daily provides privacy policy to inform users of our policies and procedures regarding
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:23.080]   the collection.
[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:24.080]   Use disclosure.
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:25.080]   It's the same.
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:27.760]   He just did a search and replace on Twitter.
[00:34:27.760 --> 00:34:28.760]   Yeah.
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:32.240]   [laughs]
[00:34:32.240 --> 00:34:34.200]   This site is not directed to persons under 13.
[00:34:34.200 --> 00:34:37.720]   It'd be really great if we could find in here a clause that says, "And by the way, we
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:39.720]   put a worm on your system."
[00:34:39.720 --> 00:34:40.720]   And by the way.
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:41.720]   You've been hacked.
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:42.720]   You've been hacked.
[00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:46.000]   It's exactly the same.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:48.440]   It's pretty bold of Mikey.
[00:34:48.440 --> 00:34:49.440]   It is.
[00:34:49.440 --> 00:34:53.320]   Mikey has a weak grasp of jurisprudence, but he's a bold young lad.
[00:34:53.320 --> 00:34:54.520]   No one's diked at the door.
[00:34:54.520 --> 00:34:55.720]   Well, we don't know that.
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:34:56.720]   He might be in custody as we speak.
[00:34:56.720 --> 00:34:57.720]   Oh, I'm pretty sure you do.
[00:34:57.720 --> 00:34:58.720]   Yeah, we don't quite know.
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:34:59.720]   We can guess.
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:00.720]   [laughs]
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:02.720]   Where the fate of Mikey Mooney lays.
[00:35:02.720 --> 00:35:03.720]   Jackson Pollock.
[00:35:03.720 --> 00:35:06.800]   Not his real name says in our Facebook page.
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:07.800]   Ah, that's standard.
[00:35:07.800 --> 00:35:08.800]   Did it in high school.
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:10.640]   Got everybody's just learning accounts.
[00:35:10.640 --> 00:35:14.640]   Basically, just added all the dur-dur to help to a Twitter-dur-dur in the code and
[00:35:14.640 --> 00:35:15.640]   implement it.
[00:35:15.640 --> 00:35:16.640]   Change user password box.
[00:35:16.640 --> 00:35:18.640]   It's scripts to save and put redirect to Twitter.com.
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:20.840]   Eh, it's easy.
[00:35:20.840 --> 00:35:22.600]   It's like Jackson Pollock.
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:23.600]   I hear voices.
[00:35:23.600 --> 00:35:25.160]   This is a voice that you're saying.
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:27.080]   That's my nerdy.
[00:35:27.080 --> 00:35:28.080]   That's your real name, Jackson?
[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:29.080]   All right.
[00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:30.080]   He says his real name.
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:31.080]   Jackson Pollock?
[00:35:31.080 --> 00:35:32.080]   Yeah.
[00:35:32.080 --> 00:35:33.080]   Hmm.
[00:35:33.080 --> 00:35:35.080]   I hear it was also a hacker.
[00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:40.040]   It's amazing what you learn on Twitter these days.
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:41.040]   What would you like?
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:42.560]   A little cup of coffee.
[00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:43.560]   Some--some-- anything?
[00:35:43.560 --> 00:35:45.120]   Yeah, I'm good.
[00:35:45.120 --> 00:35:46.320]   Anything we could do for you here?
[00:35:46.320 --> 00:35:47.320]   Oh, thank you.
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.320]   See, John, if you were here--
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:49.320]   I can't hear you.
[00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:50.320]   Though, the headphones-- oh, I didn't know you couldn't hear it.
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:51.320]   I can't hear it.
[00:35:51.320 --> 00:35:54.120]   The headphones are actually not connected to anything, but you can listen all you want.
[00:35:54.120 --> 00:35:55.120]   Yeah.
[00:35:55.120 --> 00:35:56.120]   You hear anything?
[00:35:56.120 --> 00:35:57.120]   Things are terrible.
[00:35:57.120 --> 00:35:58.120]   Are you hearing anything?
[00:35:58.120 --> 00:35:59.120]   I can't hear anything.
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:00.120]   No, they're not connected to anything.
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:02.120]   I thought they were over here for a reason.
[00:36:02.120 --> 00:36:03.120]   Just tell me if you can't hear.
[00:36:03.120 --> 00:36:04.120]   I'll turn it up.
[00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:05.120]   You just put them up, then I could probably hear better.
[00:36:05.120 --> 00:36:06.120]   Yeah, I didn't know you couldn't hear it.
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:08.120]   Yeah, it was a little hard for me to--
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:09.120]   Oh, I'm so sorry.
[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:11.800]   --keep to hear the boys on the phone.
[00:36:11.800 --> 00:36:13.400]   Men on the phone, rather.
[00:36:13.400 --> 00:36:15.400]   Boys to men.
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:17.440]   Can you hear them now?
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:19.520]   They're being very quiet.
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:20.520]   How's that sunsare?
[00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:21.520]   Is that delicious?
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:22.520]   Hey, guys.
[00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:23.520]   Speak.
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:24.520]   Hello.
[00:36:24.520 --> 00:36:25.520]   Hello.
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:27.520]   That was weird.
[00:36:27.520 --> 00:36:31.160]   John spoke, but Will's mouth moved.
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:32.760]   I'm very confused now.
[00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:34.360]   Willy, I think you're muted.
[00:36:34.360 --> 00:36:35.360]   Yeah, you are.
[00:36:35.360 --> 00:36:36.360]   No, I bet.
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:37.360]   There you go.
[00:36:37.360 --> 00:36:39.400]   It just does connection stinks.
[00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:40.880]   Both of your connections aren't too good.
[00:36:40.880 --> 00:36:42.560]   You know what's ironic is you're using our--
[00:36:42.560 --> 00:36:44.720]   I'm 15 up.
[00:36:44.720 --> 00:36:45.720]   I know.
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:49.760]   I don't understand it because you're breaking up a little bit too.
[00:36:49.760 --> 00:36:53.400]   And you're on our very fancy new ethernet in the first mile connection.
[00:36:53.400 --> 00:36:55.400]   Wow, really?
[00:36:55.400 --> 00:36:57.400]   You have ethernet in the first mile?
[00:36:57.400 --> 00:36:58.400]   Yeah.
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:01.000]   We've always got these new things.
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   We've got these new.
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   It is mental.
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.680]   But you see, with Skype of Saurus, you don't know about Skype of Saurus.
[00:37:06.680 --> 00:37:10.920]   We have four different computers each running their own instance of Skype.
[00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:15.360]   And so we can have each one has its own video so we can see all the video.
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:17.360]   And then we got ethernet in the first mile.
[00:37:17.360 --> 00:37:18.920]   Nine megabits up and down.
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:21.160]   True actual rock solid.
[00:37:21.160 --> 00:37:22.160]   It's like--
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:23.800]   That's almost like being back in college.
[00:37:23.800 --> 00:37:27.880]   I remember being in college and I had 100 meg in my room.
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:28.880]   Oh, man.
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:33.840]   And you could get 100 meg up and down the academic network in the UK.
[00:37:33.840 --> 00:37:40.480]   I remember getting the entire open office disc, I saw in about 45 seconds.
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:43.280]   It was awesome.
[00:37:43.280 --> 00:37:46.160]   Front page of the Wall Street Journal on Saturday.
[00:37:46.160 --> 00:37:51.080]   Steve Jobs maintains grip at Apple.
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:53.160]   That headline sounds like so evil.
[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:55.680]   It doesn't-- it sounds like he's not losing his grip.
[00:37:55.680 --> 00:37:56.680]   Yeah, Ali.
[00:37:56.680 --> 00:37:58.480]   It sounds like Darth Vader, doesn't it?
[00:37:58.480 --> 00:38:02.360]   When you hear like holding your grip, you immediately think of like, I have you now.
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:04.760]   Yes, it's like evil sounding.
[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:08.920]   It's like he's a sith lord and he has hold of Apple still.
[00:38:08.920 --> 00:38:10.880]   It's not maintained control.
[00:38:10.880 --> 00:38:12.360]   It's not maintained influence.
[00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:16.200]   It's not in use to brand its hold grip.
[00:38:16.200 --> 00:38:17.200]   Yeah.
[00:38:17.200 --> 00:38:20.360]   Well, you just see the fist.
[00:38:20.360 --> 00:38:22.520]   And I thought Microsoft was the eel empire.
[00:38:22.520 --> 00:38:29.320]   They say insiders say that Jobs is still running the show, that the board is in direct contact
[00:38:29.320 --> 00:38:34.680]   with Jobs and his doctors, that they all anticipate Steve will come back at the end of June.
[00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:36.760]   John, do you find that credible?
[00:38:36.760 --> 00:38:37.760]   No.
[00:38:37.760 --> 00:38:43.080]   But I do only because if they said that and it didn't happen, wouldn't-- we've talked
[00:38:43.080 --> 00:38:46.840]   about this before, but wouldn't that be kind of bad?
[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:54.280]   I'm sure that the lawyers, let's say that this is not 100% accurate.
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:55.920]   What if it's disinformation?
[00:38:55.920 --> 00:39:02.880]   I would suspect that the lawyers have been consulted before they say anything about anything.
[00:39:02.880 --> 00:39:04.240]   I would think.
[00:39:04.240 --> 00:39:08.440]   And when the lawyers say, well, to avoid exposure, you should only tell the truth.
[00:39:08.440 --> 00:39:10.480]   Well, do you say that?
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:12.800]   But how often have they told the truth about this whole harsh?
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:13.800]   It's a good name.
[00:39:13.800 --> 00:39:16.640]   They are telling the truth.
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:17.640]   Well, that's what I'm saying.
[00:39:17.640 --> 00:39:19.880]   Well, for now, because it's a prediction.
[00:39:19.880 --> 00:39:20.880]   Did we look at it?
[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:24.040]   Yeah, you want me to read the-- this is the-- you know what?
[00:39:24.040 --> 00:39:25.240]   Maybe we could parse the quote.
[00:39:25.240 --> 00:39:27.440]   Maybe that's the issue.
[00:39:27.440 --> 00:39:32.000]   Maybe it's a question of getting the exact right sentence.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:33.880]   So let me pull up the Wall Street Journal.
[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:36.920]   I hate it when they make me want to log in.
[00:39:36.920 --> 00:39:40.800]   I think it's actually really strategic for them to publish something like this.
[00:39:40.800 --> 00:39:46.000]   Even if it's not true, because if something happens, or let's say if his health fills
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:50.200]   further, then it's not like someone's going to say, but you said, but you said you were
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:53.280]   going to come back, and that's why I invested more money in your stock.
[00:39:53.280 --> 00:39:58.880]   Well, that's the risk is that a stockholder lawsuit, if they say he's going to come back
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:02.440]   and the stockholders-- you know, Apple's stock is going up.
[00:40:02.440 --> 00:40:03.440]   Right.
[00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:08.520]   But it did take a hit when he was stepping down.
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:12.280]   Well, but there seemed-- yeah, but it's backed quite a bit.
[00:40:12.280 --> 00:40:18.360]   In fact, since December, Apple's stock is up considerably, oddly enough.
[00:40:18.360 --> 00:40:21.800]   They're trying to ride that wave by just like feeling the fire with this news.
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:22.800]   Well, that's--
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:27.200]   I'm not saying Apple's like evil don't get me wrong, but--
[00:40:27.200 --> 00:40:30.280]   It seems like that would be a very risky thing to do.
[00:40:30.280 --> 00:40:33.080]   I'm sorry, I'm still trying to pull up this article.
[00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:34.080]   I subscribe.
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:37.080]   I actually pay for the Wall Street Journal, and I have a log in.
[00:40:37.080 --> 00:40:41.760]   I can read these articles in full, but it always wants me to log in again, and I don't
[00:40:41.760 --> 00:40:45.040]   remember my password, and it's just a pain in that.
[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:46.040]   Tuckus.
[00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:51.360]   You know, it's weird if you do a Google News search for these stories.
[00:40:51.360 --> 00:40:53.880]   Google has a link to the full story on Wall Street Journal somehow.
[00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:55.920]   Yeah, it's like a weird loophole.
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:40:56.920]   I've noticed that too.
[00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:59.200]   I just don't understand it.
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:06.480]   So let me go through Google News.
[00:41:06.480 --> 00:41:10.960]   Venturebeat is saying, well, I guess they're echoing the Wall Street Journal.
[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:12.800]   Let's look at the Wall Street Journal article.
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:17.440]   It may be that you might be right, John, if you parse it carefully, they may not be saying
[00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:18.440]   anything.
[00:41:18.440 --> 00:41:20.760]   Mr. Jobs didn't respond to requests for comment.
[00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:27.680]   Apple spokesman Steve Dowling said, quote, "Steve continues to look forward to returning
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:31.400]   to Apple at the end of June."
[00:41:31.400 --> 00:41:34.080]   Which makes absolutely no guarantees that he will.
[00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:35.080]   He's just looking forward to it.
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:36.080]   I think it's very--
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:37.080]   Yeah.
[00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:38.560]   It's very carefully worded.
[00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:39.560]   All right.
[00:41:39.560 --> 00:41:43.640]   Let me see what the other quotes are.
[00:41:43.640 --> 00:41:47.480]   Phil Schiller says, "We're just trying to do what we do every day."
[00:41:47.480 --> 00:41:49.000]   No, that doesn't say anything, does it?
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:50.000]   Maybe the journal--
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   That's it.
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   Yeah, that's informative.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:53.000]   Yeah.
[00:41:53.000 --> 00:42:02.200]   It's probably one of those things that's designed to sound reassuring without actually
[00:42:02.200 --> 00:42:04.120]   giving any insurance.
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:10.280]   Now they're quoting insiders also who say the jobs is still closely involved in key aspects
[00:42:10.280 --> 00:42:15.880]   of running the company.
[00:42:15.880 --> 00:42:20.920]   Insiders who are not named and therefore can't believe that Apple record.
[00:42:20.920 --> 00:42:21.920]   Incord.
[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:22.920]   Inciders.
[00:42:22.920 --> 00:42:31.800]   I'm trying to find there is a quote in here that they are in touch with his doctors.
[00:42:31.800 --> 00:42:34.960]   Let me just see if I can find that.
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:37.240]   Or like that they're working with his doctors.
[00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:39.240]   They're constant touch.
[00:42:39.240 --> 00:42:40.240]   They're constant touch.
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:43.280]   Here it is.
[00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:48.240]   People familiar with Apple's operations, again, you know, unnamed say they still expect to
[00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:50.720]   see Mr. Jobs return in June.
[00:42:50.720 --> 00:42:55.120]   Some of these people also say members of Apple's board of directors are monitoring the situation
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:59.160]   directly, communicating regularly with Mr. Jobs' physicians.
[00:42:59.160 --> 00:43:04.920]   The author of this article is Yucari Iwatani Kane.
[00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:11.880]   I think the journal has pretty good reporters, but do you think that Kane got suckered by
[00:43:11.880 --> 00:43:13.880]   Apple insiders?
[00:43:13.880 --> 00:43:19.960]   Well, it wouldn't be the first time Apple has rolled out unnamed insiders to not confirm
[00:43:19.960 --> 00:43:22.760]   or not deny any rumor that mail in may not be the case.
[00:43:22.760 --> 00:43:30.960]   I mean, we've had so many cases where famously Watchmikle at Goldman on CBS.
[00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:33.160]   Jim Goldman just got complete.
[00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:39.360]   Jim worked at Tech TV as our business reporter.
[00:43:39.360 --> 00:43:41.360]   I'll be honest with you.
[00:43:41.360 --> 00:43:49.080]   He always had a fondness for the public relations report, the press release.
[00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:54.360]   Yeah, he kind of had a fondness for that.
[00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:58.880]   Talking about talks which might not be talks, which might not be reassuring.
[00:43:58.880 --> 00:44:04.600]   Did you see that allegedly the Yahoo CEO, Carol Bartz and Steve Ormer had a face-to-face
[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:07.880]   this week to discuss possible search partnerships?
[00:44:07.880 --> 00:44:08.880]   Yeah.
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:12.440]   Once again, once again, they're doing that.
[00:44:12.440 --> 00:44:21.840]   No, according to sources closest to Yahoo, the discussion is not about acquisition, but
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:26.440]   are about some kind of partnership that will involve Microsoft taking all the value in Yahoo
[00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:31.440]   without actually paying any money for it.
[00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:33.440]   Is that your quote or is that actually what it is?
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:35.440]   Damn, no, I've made the last bit out.
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:36.440]   I like that.
[00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:39.040]   That might be the most honest quote I've heard.
[00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:42.280]   Well, why buy the company when you can do a search partnership, which is all you really
[00:44:42.280 --> 00:44:43.280]   want anyway.
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:44.280]   Yeah.
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:45.280]   That's actually very smart.
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:48.120]   Yeah, I mean, you're just getting what you want.
[00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:50.760]   But don't actually what they really wanted was the ad network, wasn't it?
[00:44:50.760 --> 00:44:52.760]   Wasn't the ad network what they really wanted?
[00:44:52.760 --> 00:44:53.760]   Well, same thing.
[00:44:53.760 --> 00:44:55.320]   Search and ads are the same thing these days.
[00:44:55.320 --> 00:44:56.320]   Oh, they are.
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:57.320]   Absolutely.
[00:44:57.320 --> 00:44:59.160]   What's the point of search without ads?
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:02.960]   What's the point of ads without search, you might argue?
[00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:03.960]   I don't know.
[00:45:03.960 --> 00:45:05.480]   Search you're looking for something.
[00:45:05.480 --> 00:45:10.600]   Yeah, but the only way to monetize a search is we're going to add.
[00:45:10.600 --> 00:45:16.320]   So if they did it, okay, well, I'm just saying that when you say a search deal like Yahoo
[00:45:16.320 --> 00:45:21.360]   for a while had a search deal with Google where it was Google search, wasn't Google ads.
[00:45:21.360 --> 00:45:25.000]   So you're saying if they're saying a search deal, they mean a search and ads deal.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:26.360]   Yeah, that's the anyway.
[00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:28.360]   You never make any money.
[00:45:28.360 --> 00:45:32.760]   Otherwise, you just be paying money to get people to search using your search engine,
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:36.120]   which I can't see would be that interesting.
[00:45:36.120 --> 00:45:38.800]   I don't know.
[00:45:38.800 --> 00:45:40.280]   I don't know.
[00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:42.360]   I just, this is the story.
[00:45:42.360 --> 00:45:44.560]   This is the vampire of tech stories.
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:45.560]   It's just real.
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:49.320]   Well, this is the next one developing is the IBM Sun story.
[00:45:49.320 --> 00:45:50.600]   I thought that was dead.
[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:54.200]   Well, now they're, you know, now they're wondering if maybe he's going to come back and take
[00:45:54.200 --> 00:45:56.360]   over the company and things like that.
[00:45:56.360 --> 00:46:00.960]   So the story was that McNeely wanted to sell to I know, no, Schwartz wanted to sell to
[00:46:00.960 --> 00:46:01.960]   IBM.
[00:46:01.960 --> 00:46:02.960]   McNeely did not.
[00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:03.960]   Right.
[00:46:03.960 --> 00:46:06.000]   It's his baby.
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:11.440]   And Schwartz, who's the current CEO, realized the writing was on the wall and said, let's
[00:46:11.440 --> 00:46:13.280]   take the money and run.
[00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:17.400]   So you think Scott McNeely will kick Jonathan Schwartz out and take the company back?
[00:46:17.400 --> 00:46:19.440]   Well, that's what a lot of people think.
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:20.440]   Interesting.
[00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:25.000]   Now, this is very similar, isn't it, to the Yahoo deal where Jerry Yang didn't want to
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:26.000]   sell.
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   Right.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   Founders remorse.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:29.000]   Yeah.
[00:46:29.000 --> 00:46:33.880]   And a CEO when you're pushing off for an opposite situation because if you got the guy who did
[00:46:33.880 --> 00:46:38.160]   want to sell being, you, no matter what you do, you can't win.
[00:46:38.160 --> 00:46:39.160]   Yeah.
[00:46:39.160 --> 00:46:40.160]   Yeah.
[00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:44.240]   It's hard to be tenable as a CEO when you're pushing really hard for sale.
[00:46:44.240 --> 00:46:45.440]   And then the sale doesn't happen.
[00:46:45.440 --> 00:46:47.640]   It's like, we're going to be fine anyway.
[00:46:47.640 --> 00:46:49.520]   And it's like, we're going to be fine anyway.
[00:46:49.520 --> 00:46:52.000]   Why are you for sale so hard?
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:53.440]   We haven't heard a lot from Carol Bartz.
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:47:00.080]   This must be your first, this is your first action going to talk to Steve Balmer.
[00:47:00.080 --> 00:47:02.600]   They probably know each other from the good old days.
[00:47:02.600 --> 00:47:03.600]   Let's take her.
[00:47:03.600 --> 00:47:04.600]   Let's take a break.
[00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:07.320]   We're going to come back and talk about the Palm pre rumor has it.
[00:47:07.320 --> 00:47:12.920]   It might be coming sooner than later, which would be a very good thing, not just for the
[00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:17.440]   Palm, but for people who are trying to decide, well, should I get an iPhone or should I get
[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:18.440]   a Palm pre?
[00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:19.440]   Hmm.
[00:47:19.440 --> 00:47:22.080]   We can expect a new iPhone in June.
[00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:26.200]   What should the timing be for the iPhone killer from Palm?
[00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:29.560]   Before we talk about that though, let me mention our friends at squarespace.com.
[00:47:29.560 --> 00:47:32.640]   Squarespace is a great place to do your blog.
[00:47:32.640 --> 00:47:35.280]   I'm moving my stuff over to squarespace.com.
[00:47:35.280 --> 00:47:39.680]   It's a hosted blogging solution that is just fantastic.
[00:47:39.680 --> 00:47:43.640]   If you go to squarespace.com/twit right now, you can see a little bit.
[00:47:43.640 --> 00:47:46.480]   In fact, you can actually try it free for two weeks, no credit card or anything.
[00:47:46.480 --> 00:47:49.280]   It's the instant, create an account instantly.
[00:47:49.280 --> 00:47:51.480]   See the hundreds of templates, beautiful templates.
[00:47:51.480 --> 00:47:55.920]   But once you've got the template, then how customization works is beautifully using a
[00:47:55.920 --> 00:48:03.000]   lot of Ajax to make it, you literally can drag and drop column widths, slide it over.
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.480]   But now that's for beginners, if you're a CSS expert, you can get right into the CSS
[00:48:06.480 --> 00:48:09.360]   and customize to your heart's desire.
[00:48:09.360 --> 00:48:11.080]   A very great administrative UI.
[00:48:11.080 --> 00:48:12.560]   I've used them all from all the blogs.
[00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:14.560]   This one's the best I've ever seen.
[00:48:14.560 --> 00:48:17.440]   And it comes with, now I don't want to say blogs because it's not just blogs.
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:23.200]   It has a blog module, which by the way supports import and export for WordPress, for blogger,
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:25.480]   for movable type and for type pad.
[00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:28.240]   So your data isn't locked in.
[00:48:28.240 --> 00:48:31.080]   It's easy to move in and easy to move out should you choose.
[00:48:31.080 --> 00:48:34.120]   There's a forum, great forum software.
[00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:38.720]   And imagine your website, you have all of this functionality, photo gallery, a forum
[00:48:38.720 --> 00:48:42.280]   builder, there's Google Maps integration, there's discus integration.
[00:48:42.280 --> 00:48:45.280]   I use discus as my commenting system.
[00:48:45.280 --> 00:48:48.080]   Like that was my concern when we were talking about moving over.
[00:48:48.080 --> 00:48:49.240]   I said, yeah, I'd love to move over.
[00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:54.240]   I like everything, but I want to use my, I want to continue to use my discus comment system.
[00:48:54.240 --> 00:48:57.880]   They said, no problem, one line of JavaScript, it's easy.
[00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:03.760]   The cloud architecture of the design makes it very speedy and very stable.
[00:49:03.760 --> 00:49:09.480]   And should the traffic suddenly ramp up, you know, you got dug or tweeted, it handles
[00:49:09.480 --> 00:49:10.480]   it.
[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:13.400]   And that's one of the reasons I want to move it over there because every time we send a
[00:49:13.400 --> 00:49:17.600]   lot of traffic to Twitch, it kills Leofil and vice versa.
[00:49:17.600 --> 00:49:19.360]   They're on the same server.
[00:49:19.360 --> 00:49:22.720]   Great website tracking built in search engine optimization.
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:23.720]   Give it a try.
[00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:26.600]   Squarespace.com/twit.
[00:49:26.600 --> 00:49:30.320]   And then if you decide to buy, use Twit as the offer code, you'll save 10%.
[00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:34.640]   No credit card necessary to try it.
[00:49:34.640 --> 00:49:38.760]   Squarespace.com.
[00:49:38.760 --> 00:49:45.160]   So article in after dawn.com, which was for a long time, a great site for kind of information
[00:49:45.160 --> 00:49:47.880]   about ripping DVDs and so forth.
[00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:54.680]   They're saying it may be out the Palm pre maybe out in May.
[00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:58.960]   According to a bright hand, Sprint employees have been granted no vacation time in the
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:00.040]   month of May.
[00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:05.080]   This is that same story that we heard at AT&T when the iPhones come out.
[00:50:05.080 --> 00:50:10.720]   The expected release date May 17th May 17th.
[00:50:10.720 --> 00:50:15.040]   That would be very interesting and an interesting strategy too because I think everybody agrees
[00:50:15.040 --> 00:50:20.600]   that in the June timeframe, you're going to see a new iPhone, which is better for Palm.
[00:50:20.600 --> 00:50:24.760]   Is it better to release the pre before or after Apple updates its iPhone?
[00:50:24.760 --> 00:50:28.080]   Everybody's very interested in what Apple is going to do with the third generation iPhone.
[00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:31.160]   That 3.0 software is very popular.
[00:50:31.160 --> 00:50:33.920]   Will you still using your iPhone?
[00:50:33.920 --> 00:50:36.080]   Oh, I never put it down.
[00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:39.680]   It's one of those things where you kind of really don't realize how you could possibly
[00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:42.160]   have lived your life before it actually happened.
[00:50:42.160 --> 00:50:47.080]   Before you got the iPhone, how did you manage to work or exist?
[00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:48.720]   So yeah, I still use it.
[00:50:48.720 --> 00:50:54.280]   I think the Palm pre is going to have it hard because it will have a really nice big market
[00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:59.960]   splash in I think May is looking like a pretty late timeframe from what I know.
[00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:03.000]   Then it's just going to get, I don't want to say it's going to get blown away in June
[00:51:03.000 --> 00:51:06.760]   by the new iPhone, but Apple is going to have I think probably something pretty compelling
[00:51:06.760 --> 00:51:10.680]   for the new iPhone in June.
[00:51:10.680 --> 00:51:13.200]   The pre might have a really nice window.
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:16.000]   It's better for the pre to come before the new iPhone.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:21.080]   I would say rather than after the new iPhone because there's every chance that it could
[00:51:21.080 --> 00:51:25.480]   be dead before it's alive in the case.
[00:51:25.480 --> 00:51:26.760]   Well, let me think about this.
[00:51:26.760 --> 00:51:29.200]   Now, of course, there are other iPhone killers.
[00:51:29.200 --> 00:51:33.800]   It was the Blackberry Storm, which was terrible, terrible.
[00:51:33.800 --> 00:51:36.120]   And the Samsung Instinct, terrible.
[00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:38.480]   So is it better for them?
[00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:40.840]   I don't know.
[00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:42.640]   I think you probably want to come out before the iPhone.
[00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:43.640]   I think you're right.
[00:51:43.640 --> 00:51:45.440]   What about Nihar, are you an iPhone user?
[00:51:45.440 --> 00:51:46.440]   I'm not.
[00:51:46.440 --> 00:51:47.440]   You're a Blackberry.
[00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:48.840]   I'm a Blackberry Pearl user.
[00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:50.080]   It comes down to that, doesn't it?
[00:51:50.080 --> 00:51:51.080]   It's Blackberry or iPhone.
[00:51:51.080 --> 00:51:52.080]   Those are the choices.
[00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:53.080]   It really is.
[00:51:53.080 --> 00:51:55.440]   And you know, I've been using it for a long time.
[00:51:55.440 --> 00:52:00.160]   I had a job a little while ago where they gave me an iPhone to use.
[00:52:00.160 --> 00:52:02.680]   So I used it for a couple of months and I liked it.
[00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:08.440]   I was originally very anti iPhone because you know, it's like you go out in a social
[00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:14.160]   situation and everyone just has their iPhone out and it's like this weird...
[00:52:14.160 --> 00:52:16.400]   Well, that's why I'm any Twitter because it's kind of...
[00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:17.400]   You know, they're all Twittering.
[00:52:17.400 --> 00:52:18.800]   That's what they're doing.
[00:52:18.800 --> 00:52:20.160]   I mean, it's a little annoying.
[00:52:20.160 --> 00:52:21.160]   I'm sorry.
[00:52:21.160 --> 00:52:22.320]   It's very annoying.
[00:52:22.320 --> 00:52:25.000]   I just think it kind of takes out the fun of actually...
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:26.240]   But people do that with Blackberries, too.
[00:52:26.240 --> 00:52:27.240]   You can't deny that.
[00:52:27.240 --> 00:52:28.240]   Okay, yeah.
[00:52:28.240 --> 00:52:30.000]   No, and I Twitter, I tweet from my Blackberry as well.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:31.000]   Yeah, so there you go.
[00:52:31.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   So that's just as annoying.
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:33.880]   So I understand that.
[00:52:33.880 --> 00:52:35.320]   But I'm curious.
[00:52:35.320 --> 00:52:40.960]   I wonder, do you think that some people who may have resisted the iPhone, like maybe,
[00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:43.320]   you know, really anti-Apple PC people?
[00:52:43.320 --> 00:52:47.000]   Do you think that they may really go for the pre versus...
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:48.200]   I'm really interested in the pre.
[00:52:48.200 --> 00:52:49.200]   I'd love to.
[00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:50.200]   I would love to, too.
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:52.400]   And I think it just looks really simplistic and...
[00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:53.840]   I thought it was called the Prey.
[00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:54.840]   I'm sorry.
[00:52:54.840 --> 00:52:55.840]   Is it Prey?
[00:52:55.840 --> 00:52:56.840]   I don't think you'd name it Prey.
[00:52:56.840 --> 00:52:57.840]   There's the line over the E.
[00:52:57.840 --> 00:52:58.840]   So...
[00:52:58.840 --> 00:52:59.840]   It's Prey.
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:00.840]   There's the line over the E.
[00:53:00.840 --> 00:53:01.840]   John, why would you...
[00:53:01.840 --> 00:53:02.840]   I think it's long E.
[00:53:02.840 --> 00:53:03.840]   If your company's going down and this is last...
[00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:05.600]   It's a best hope, pre-bankruptcy.
[00:53:05.600 --> 00:53:08.080]   Or a pray for an help.
[00:53:08.080 --> 00:53:09.280]   One of the two.
[00:53:09.280 --> 00:53:11.360]   Why would you name the thing either one of those?
[00:53:11.360 --> 00:53:12.360]   Both of them suck.
[00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:13.760]   Yeah, it's not the greatest name.
[00:53:13.760 --> 00:53:16.400]   Prey must be, I think, marginally worse.
[00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:17.400]   Prey.
[00:53:17.400 --> 00:53:18.400]   Prey.
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:19.400]   We pray that there's a saving company.
[00:53:19.400 --> 00:53:20.400]   Prey that...
[00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:22.400]   But I mean...
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:23.400]   Great job.
[00:53:23.400 --> 00:53:24.400]   Which...
[00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:28.000]   As far as design and everything, just from the gallery and things that you can just tell
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:31.600]   on a very superficial level, it looks nice enough.
[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:34.000]   I like that it's kind of a slider foam too.
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   I like that.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:36.000]   Yeah.
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.200]   Well, you know, it's got a nice touch screen.
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:38.480]   You still get a keyboard.
[00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:39.480]   Yeah.
[00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:40.480]   I think that's something that...
[00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:42.200]   I mean, do you have an iPhone?
[00:53:42.200 --> 00:53:43.920]   Of course you do.
[00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:45.120]   Do you miss having a keyboard?
[00:53:45.120 --> 00:53:46.120]   No.
[00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:47.120]   Like a real tap-code keyboard?
[00:53:47.120 --> 00:53:48.120]   I've got really...
[00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:50.080]   You know when I first got it, I kind of went back to the Blackberry for a while because
[00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:51.480]   I really couldn't type on the thing.
[00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:52.480]   See, that killed me.
[00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:53.480]   Not having a keyboard.
[00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:54.480]   Not having a keyboard.
[00:53:54.480 --> 00:53:55.640]   You have to trust in the Steve.
[00:53:55.640 --> 00:53:58.600]   You have to let the Steve flow through you.
[00:53:58.600 --> 00:54:01.400]   And what happens is, as you type...
[00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:04.520]   You're typing all the wrong letters because it's impossible because especially with my
[00:54:04.520 --> 00:54:05.840]   fingers you can't.
[00:54:05.840 --> 00:54:08.120]   But you just trust in the Steve.
[00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:16.760]   And then at the end of the word, you will have typed x3419L2 and it will say hello.
[00:54:16.760 --> 00:54:19.640]   It just knows what you meant and you just hit space and it goes on.
[00:54:19.640 --> 00:54:20.640]   You've got to trust.
[00:54:20.640 --> 00:54:21.640]   You don't trust.
[00:54:21.640 --> 00:54:22.640]   That's your problem.
[00:54:22.640 --> 00:54:23.640]   I don't.
[00:54:23.640 --> 00:54:24.640]   I like the feeling of buttons.
[00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:28.600]   I'm a very tactile person and I like having the buttons for keyboards.
[00:54:28.600 --> 00:54:30.680]   That's why I've stayed with Blackberry.
[00:54:30.680 --> 00:54:31.680]   What John?
[00:54:31.680 --> 00:54:32.680]   I'm just saying.
[00:54:32.680 --> 00:54:36.880]   I got a message from someone the other day that believes this too.
[00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:38.680]   Believe in the Force.
[00:54:38.680 --> 00:54:39.680]   And I couldn't read it.
[00:54:39.680 --> 00:54:41.080]   It was just a bunch of crap.
[00:54:41.080 --> 00:54:42.080]   It was unreadable.
[00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:43.080]   It's unreadable.
[00:54:43.080 --> 00:54:45.160]   It just reminds me a lot of that.
[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:48.880]   What was the Newton member that there was a joke?
[00:54:48.880 --> 00:54:49.880]   Yeah.
[00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:51.760]   You remember the joke?
[00:54:51.760 --> 00:54:52.760]   I wish it no.
[00:54:52.760 --> 00:54:53.760]   I don't remember it.
[00:54:53.760 --> 00:54:54.760]   I remember it.
[00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:57.600]   How many Newtons does it take to screw in a light bulb?
[00:54:57.600 --> 00:54:58.600]   Farm.
[00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:00.600]   Right.
[00:55:00.600 --> 00:55:02.600]   What's exactly that?
[00:55:02.600 --> 00:55:03.600]   That's very key.
[00:55:03.600 --> 00:55:04.600]   Was it farm?
[00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:10.720]   I think what so many of these sort of handset manufacturers miss is that the handset is really
[00:55:10.720 --> 00:55:13.480]   only three quarters of the experience or half the experience.
[00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:17.520]   The other half the experience is your desktop interaction.
[00:55:17.520 --> 00:55:21.640]   The fact that with mobile me, okay, so it's sucked to start with, but now you have auto
[00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:27.600]   updating, synchronizing over the air 24/7 from your computer to your phone.
[00:55:27.600 --> 00:55:31.040]   You've got all your music back and forth really, really easily.
[00:55:31.040 --> 00:55:35.040]   You've got an easy way of transferring apps and getting new apps and doing it.
[00:55:35.040 --> 00:55:39.400]   The actual phone hardware is now such a relatively small part of the experience compared to the
[00:55:39.400 --> 00:55:41.920]   platform and the computer integration.
[00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:46.480]   And I just don't see the palm hat as like any plan for doing that beyond some kind of
[00:55:46.480 --> 00:55:51.600]   open source sort of developer store, which they haven't made any attempt as far as I
[00:55:51.600 --> 00:55:54.080]   can see to integrate particularly well with any platform.
[00:55:54.080 --> 00:55:58.960]   I mean, don't you agree though, I mean, back in its day, palm pilots and stuff, they did
[00:55:58.960 --> 00:55:59.960]   have pretty good.
[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:00.960]   Oh, they owned.
[00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:01.960]   They owned.
[00:56:01.960 --> 00:56:02.960]   They were.
[00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:03.960]   They were.
[00:56:03.960 --> 00:56:05.800]   So I mean, what's what's not to say that this too will have great desktop integration
[00:56:05.800 --> 00:56:07.280]   and things like that.
[00:56:07.280 --> 00:56:08.280]   Lots.
[00:56:08.280 --> 00:56:09.280]   Well, yeah.
[00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:10.280]   Where's Jeff Hawkins when we need him?
[00:56:10.280 --> 00:56:13.680]   Well, he's often vetting a human machine brain.
[00:56:13.680 --> 00:56:14.680]   Right.
[00:56:14.680 --> 00:56:15.760]   And he's the guy behind the whole thing.
[00:56:15.760 --> 00:56:18.160]   And that's why they rocked him in the early days.
[00:56:18.160 --> 00:56:21.960]   But you got to say that they what they what they did was smart as they went out and they
[00:56:21.960 --> 00:56:28.360]   got John Rubenstein and all the iPhone engineers over to do this.
[00:56:28.360 --> 00:56:31.760]   So a lot of the guys who were instrumental in design of the original iPhone are worked
[00:56:31.760 --> 00:56:33.640]   on the pre we'll see.
[00:56:33.640 --> 00:56:37.560]   It'd be very I'm reminded that blackberry clunker that you've got there.
[00:56:37.560 --> 00:56:38.560]   Oh, that storm.
[00:56:38.560 --> 00:56:40.080]   What a piece of junk.
[00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:41.360]   I was very disappointed by that.
[00:56:41.360 --> 00:56:43.760]   I was thinking of of getting the storm.
[00:56:43.760 --> 00:56:46.760]   But then when I played with it, I was like, no, I think I'm just going to stick with the
[00:56:46.760 --> 00:56:47.760]   pearl.
[00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:48.760]   The pearls still good.
[00:56:48.760 --> 00:56:49.760]   I'm not a pro.
[00:56:49.760 --> 00:56:50.760]   I like the curve.
[00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:51.760]   The old and the 8900.
[00:56:51.760 --> 00:56:52.760]   These the newer blackberries.
[00:56:52.760 --> 00:56:57.760]   Do you have the bold is that that is the boldy?
[00:56:57.760 --> 00:56:59.160]   The fun run.
[00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:02.520]   Now, while I feel like I'm it's kind of, you know, it's funny.
[00:57:02.520 --> 00:57:05.960]   For a long time, I really resisted the whole phone thing.
[00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:08.000]   And and I had one phone.
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:11.560]   But anytime I go anywhere, especially because of the radio show, right?
[00:57:11.560 --> 00:57:16.840]   Anytime I go anywhere, all of the radio station executives and salespeople all they ever want
[00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:18.760]   to talk about is cell phones.
[00:57:18.760 --> 00:57:24.480]   And I realized for the non geek, the cell phone is technology, right?
[00:57:24.480 --> 00:57:25.880]   It's the one they're most into.
[00:57:25.880 --> 00:57:28.040]   They're most aware of.
[00:57:28.040 --> 00:57:31.600]   And so as a result, I said, I think I better know more about cell phones.
[00:57:31.600 --> 00:57:35.520]   And it's turned out actually to be a was a good move, but it does require I have accounts
[00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:37.160]   with every carrier.
[00:57:37.160 --> 00:57:39.720]   Oh, God, I know it's expensive.
[00:57:39.720 --> 00:57:41.200]   But look at this.
[00:57:41.200 --> 00:57:42.200]   Here's the Android.
[00:57:42.200 --> 00:57:44.600]   This is the Google the Google phone.
[00:57:44.600 --> 00:57:51.720]   I kind of like the Android just because it's kind of funky.
[00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:53.320]   I like it, I guess.
[00:57:53.320 --> 00:57:54.320]   Here it is.
[00:57:54.320 --> 00:57:55.320]   Oh, that's where.
[00:57:55.320 --> 00:57:57.560]   I thought it was sitting in the chair.
[00:57:57.560 --> 00:57:59.400]   It's a giant.
[00:57:59.400 --> 00:58:03.800]   No, and it's all it says, sorry, process, Android process.
[00:58:03.800 --> 00:58:05.000]   Acor is not responding.
[00:58:05.000 --> 00:58:08.200]   I mean, this happens all the time.
[00:58:08.200 --> 00:58:09.440]   The battery life dies.
[00:58:09.440 --> 00:58:14.040]   I mean, there's a lot to be said for it, but it's it's just not a reliable.
[00:58:14.040 --> 00:58:15.040]   I think it's the handset.
[00:58:15.040 --> 00:58:16.040]   I don't think it's Android.
[00:58:16.040 --> 00:58:18.040]   I think it's the G1.
[00:58:18.040 --> 00:58:20.720]   I really had high hopes for this one too.
[00:58:20.720 --> 00:58:23.240]   There was a lot of hype surrounding it too when it came out.
[00:58:23.240 --> 00:58:29.360]   One thing I would like to know as far as the pre is is it as fragile as the iPhone?
[00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:30.360]   You think the iPhone's fragile?
[00:58:30.360 --> 00:58:31.360]   I think so.
[00:58:31.360 --> 00:58:35.200]   I mean, I've seen so many I've seen so many cracked screens.
[00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:41.360]   My son, there's my we did a father son thing a couple of days ago.
[00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:44.520]   We jail broke our iPhones together was really a nice moment.
[00:58:44.520 --> 00:58:45.520]   So sweet.
[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:46.520]   Touching moment.
[00:58:46.520 --> 00:58:48.240]   He says, Dad, I want to learn how to hack.
[00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:49.920]   I said, well, let's let's start with jail.
[00:58:49.920 --> 00:58:50.920]   Good net voice.
[00:58:50.920 --> 00:58:54.240]   Yeah, Dan, I want to be Mikey.
[00:58:54.240 --> 00:58:55.480]   I look up to Mikey.
[00:58:55.480 --> 00:58:59.280]   I want to start a site and hack Twitter and make everybody go to my site.
[00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:00.280]   Can you help me?
[00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:01.280]   You know what?
[00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:03.160]   When he says that my kids, both my kids say that.
[00:59:03.160 --> 00:59:07.280]   I say, well, okay, first we got to learn bash shell programming and that shuts them up
[00:59:07.280 --> 00:59:08.280]   right away.
[00:59:08.280 --> 00:59:09.280]   That would you?
[00:59:09.280 --> 00:59:11.960]   Bash shell programming, but it's true.
[00:59:11.960 --> 00:59:12.960]   Right?
[00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:15.200]   If you're going to be a hacker, you got to know the bash shell.
[00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:18.160]   Don't you say, oh, you could just be a script kitty.
[00:59:18.160 --> 00:59:19.160]   I don't know.
[00:59:19.160 --> 00:59:21.640]   No kid of mine is going to be a script kitty.
[00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:26.640]   Anyway, so we jail broke it and he found immediately an application that puts cracks
[00:59:26.640 --> 00:59:28.520]   on your screen when you touch it.
[00:59:28.520 --> 00:59:30.000]   And it really looks realistic.
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:33.800]   It looked so he goes up to his friends and say, oh, dude, I broke my iPhone and they'll
[00:59:33.800 --> 00:59:36.520]   go, oh, man, it hurts you viscerally when you see that.
[00:59:36.520 --> 00:59:38.280]   Oh, it is because it's shards of glass.
[00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:40.880]   It is just so painful to see that.
[00:59:40.880 --> 00:59:41.880]   Oh, it's terrible.
[00:59:41.880 --> 00:59:45.240]   Yeah, but I'm curious if this is if this would be.
[00:59:45.240 --> 00:59:46.240]   I don't think this is that vulnerable.
[00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:47.440]   This will have a similar issue.
[00:59:47.440 --> 00:59:50.520]   Yeah, you know, glass screens, glass screens.
[00:59:50.520 --> 00:59:51.440]   Exactly.
[00:59:51.440 --> 00:59:57.720]   Um, let's see, you know, I just Jason Calicanis keeps bugging me.
[00:59:57.720 --> 01:00:01.040]   He's in Korea and he wants to show off his bandwidth.
[01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:04.880]   So maybe we'll give him a jingle in a little bit.
[01:00:04.880 --> 01:00:07.040]   The bandwidth in Korea is overrated.
[01:00:07.040 --> 01:00:08.040]   Really?
[01:00:08.040 --> 01:00:10.640]   Cause you were, you came back singing its praises.
[01:00:10.640 --> 01:00:12.200]   No, you didn't?
[01:00:12.200 --> 01:00:13.520]   No, not really.
[01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:15.360]   I was, I think I was complaining.
[01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:16.360]   Oh, wow.
[01:00:16.360 --> 01:00:21.080]   I think they, I think they talk a big game over there and maybe at the university or
[01:00:21.080 --> 01:00:23.320]   someplace like that might have some speed.
[01:00:23.320 --> 01:00:28.320]   But the funny thing was I had, in fact, Ken Rutkowski took us over there.
[01:00:28.320 --> 01:00:29.800]   He was complaining bitterly.
[01:00:29.800 --> 01:00:33.960]   I have a video of him complaining about it since his bogus and then just out of the
[01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:39.000]   blue, like about six months ago, one of the guy, the network analysts over at Mevio was
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.080]   giving a presentation showing the various speeds on the edge.
[01:00:42.080 --> 01:00:43.080]   Yeah.
[01:00:43.080 --> 01:00:44.080]   Korea was the worst.
[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:47.440]   Well, edge is terrible.
[01:00:47.440 --> 01:00:50.960]   You mean, mean, they're, they're talking about like at the Akamai network.
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:52.360]   Oh, at the edge of the network.
[01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:53.360]   Oh, really?
[01:00:53.360 --> 01:00:57.080]   That where you'd have all these, you know, you're supposed to have all this, this boost.
[01:00:57.080 --> 01:00:59.440]   And it was the worst of the whole, all the country internationally.
[01:00:59.440 --> 01:01:02.840]   And then of course I asked them about that and they said, well, it's possible that, you
[01:01:02.840 --> 01:01:06.120]   know, because the Koreans don't, don't do this or that.
[01:01:06.120 --> 01:01:10.080]   Maybe it's just a fake number, but I doubt that the connection is going to be that good.
[01:01:10.080 --> 01:01:12.360]   You should, you know, how interesting.
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:14.360]   I, you know, this is, this was like the big thing.
[01:01:14.360 --> 01:01:18.080]   Like they're the, the wired, most wired nation, you know, who really has a lot of
[01:01:18.080 --> 01:01:19.320]   bandwidth, Sweden.
[01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:20.320]   Yeah.
[01:01:20.320 --> 01:01:21.640]   Sweden does have a lot of bandwidth.
[01:01:21.640 --> 01:01:26.080]   That's the first place I saw IPTV and it was years ago and it was just like cable TV.
[01:01:26.080 --> 01:01:27.080]   It was so good.
[01:01:27.080 --> 01:01:29.080]   You could click, click, click right through any channels.
[01:01:29.080 --> 01:01:31.840]   It was, you know, you wouldn't even know you weren't on cable TV.
[01:01:31.840 --> 01:01:32.840]   Yeah.
[01:01:32.840 --> 01:01:38.200]   Because it was 30 megs, like everywhere.
[01:01:38.200 --> 01:01:41.360]   Many of our Swedish listeners say they've got a hundred megs.
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:42.360]   Yeah.
[01:01:42.360 --> 01:01:44.480]   Well, it was 30 megs three years ago.
[01:01:44.480 --> 01:01:45.480]   Yeah.
[01:01:45.480 --> 01:01:46.480]   Let's see.
[01:01:46.480 --> 01:01:51.760]   I think Jason's on the, let me see if I can get Jason on the line here from, you're
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:53.840]   have to have to twist his knobs.
[01:01:53.840 --> 01:01:55.680]   I don't even know which knob he is.
[01:01:55.680 --> 01:01:57.760]   He probably liked that.
[01:01:57.760 --> 01:02:01.040]   Oh, it begins already.
[01:02:01.040 --> 01:02:02.040]   Jason, can you hear me?
[01:02:02.040 --> 01:02:03.320]   Oh, we lost his connection.
[01:02:03.320 --> 01:02:06.720]   I guess that great South Korean bandwidth failed us.
[01:02:06.720 --> 01:02:07.720]   The irony.
[01:02:07.720 --> 01:02:08.720]   The irony.
[01:02:08.720 --> 01:02:09.720]   The irony.
[01:02:09.720 --> 01:02:10.720]   Connection lost.
[01:02:10.720 --> 01:02:12.560]   I have no connection.
[01:02:12.560 --> 01:02:15.560]   Sweden just has it all going on.
[01:02:15.560 --> 01:02:16.560]   It's funny.
[01:02:16.560 --> 01:02:18.520]   I don't know what happened there.
[01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:19.520]   All right.
[01:02:19.520 --> 01:02:24.560]   Moving on to yet another fascinating story.
[01:02:24.560 --> 01:02:27.920]   Did you see the journal article about, oh, I guess we already kind of talked about spies
[01:02:27.920 --> 01:02:29.160]   in the grid, didn't we?
[01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:35.080]   Those are, we kind of talked about that peripherally at the very top of the show.
[01:02:35.080 --> 01:02:37.600]   The Zoom HD, there's a good story.
[01:02:37.600 --> 01:02:39.560]   Y'all excited?
[01:02:39.560 --> 01:02:40.560]   Oh.
[01:02:40.560 --> 01:02:41.560]   Oh.
[01:02:41.560 --> 01:02:42.560]   Oh.
[01:02:42.560 --> 01:02:45.400]   All right.
[01:02:45.400 --> 01:02:49.440]   This is a common topic for me.
[01:02:49.440 --> 01:02:51.000]   Something I've always hated.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.280]   The cost of SMS messages.
[01:02:54.280 --> 01:03:00.640]   I once calculated that at the typical cost of 20 cents a message, 140 byte message, you're
[01:03:00.640 --> 01:03:03.360]   paying $1,500 a megabyte.
[01:03:03.360 --> 01:03:04.360]   Seems high.
[01:03:04.360 --> 01:03:05.360]   Seems high.
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:09.640]   You guys have such a remedial asset system.
[01:03:09.640 --> 01:03:10.640]   It's terrible.
[01:03:10.640 --> 01:03:14.360]   And you know, the phone companies use this as a way to take advantage of us, basically.
[01:03:14.360 --> 01:03:15.360]   It's true.
[01:03:15.360 --> 01:03:16.360]   Yeah.
[01:03:16.360 --> 01:03:17.360]   We'll take advantage of teenage girls.
[01:03:17.360 --> 01:03:22.880]   Well, you might be right because Dina Kristofferson of Cheyenne, Wyoming got quite a surprise in
[01:03:22.880 --> 01:03:24.880]   the mail the other day.
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:28.400]   She's a Wyoming 13 year old.
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:32.360]   Mom and dad thought that they had turned off text messaging on her phone.
[01:03:32.360 --> 01:03:35.760]   And as a result, they never ordered a text messaging plan.
[01:03:35.760 --> 01:03:37.120]   Oh, that was a big mistake.
[01:03:37.120 --> 01:03:39.520]   That was a bad idea to begin with.
[01:03:39.520 --> 01:03:46.760]   Dina sent or received 20,000 text messages in one.
[01:03:46.760 --> 01:03:47.760]   Oh my God.
[01:03:47.760 --> 01:03:49.760]   In one billion cycle?
[01:03:49.760 --> 01:03:50.760]   Yes.
[01:03:50.760 --> 01:03:51.960]   Does this girl speak?
[01:03:51.960 --> 01:03:52.960]   Or does she just talk?
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:58.080]   Then she's doing a 700 texts a day rate, more or less.
[01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:01.480]   Well, remember, incoming accounts as well as outgoing.
[01:04:01.480 --> 01:04:02.480]   Right.
[01:04:02.480 --> 01:04:03.480]   Well, still.
[01:04:03.480 --> 01:04:07.240]   So you could subscribe to Twitter, for instance, and say, I want all my Twitter messages to
[01:04:07.240 --> 01:04:12.040]   come in and out, in and out, and boom, bang, bang.
[01:04:12.040 --> 01:04:15.320]   So, uh, you want to take a guess at what her bill was?
[01:04:15.320 --> 01:04:16.320]   Twitter users.
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:19.320]   I'm going to go with round about $5,000.
[01:04:19.320 --> 01:04:20.320]   Very good.
[01:04:20.320 --> 01:04:21.320]   Bingo.
[01:04:21.320 --> 01:04:23.320]   Were you reading the article?
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:29.200]   You, you, you, it was $4,750.
[01:04:29.200 --> 01:04:35.080]   Her father, Greg Christofferson, told KUSA TV in Denver that he thought texting had been
[01:04:35.080 --> 01:04:37.320]   disabled on the phone.
[01:04:37.320 --> 01:04:44.240]   When he got the bill, he took a hammer and smashed the phone into pieces.
[01:04:44.240 --> 01:04:45.240]   That's discipline.
[01:04:45.240 --> 01:04:47.240]   Dina will text no more.
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:49.960]   But I don't blame Dina on this.
[01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:50.960]   I blame Verizon.
[01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:55.160]   Well, actually I blame her parents for taking off text messaging altogether.
[01:04:55.160 --> 01:04:58.040]   That was, that was, that was just a bad idea.
[01:04:58.040 --> 01:05:01.000]   If your child has a text messaging problem, do you text a lot?
[01:05:01.000 --> 01:05:02.000]   I do.
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.000]   How much?
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:04.760]   Not $5,000 worth.
[01:05:04.760 --> 01:05:06.280]   Twenty, not 20,000 messages.
[01:05:06.280 --> 01:05:08.280]   No, and I would, like everything.
[01:05:08.280 --> 01:05:10.120]   No, I don't think I text that much.
[01:05:10.120 --> 01:05:14.720]   And even, you know, but you know who, who does text a lot are Indian people in India.
[01:05:14.720 --> 01:05:16.920]   Everyone is, it's all about SMSing there.
[01:05:16.920 --> 01:05:17.920]   No voicemail in India.
[01:05:17.920 --> 01:05:18.920]   The Brits too, right?
[01:05:18.920 --> 01:05:19.920]   Everybody texts.
[01:05:19.920 --> 01:05:21.760]   Well, actually, college is in this country too.
[01:05:21.760 --> 01:05:23.360]   Absolutely text like crazy.
[01:05:23.360 --> 01:05:24.360]   Which I think is because we-
[01:05:24.360 --> 01:05:26.240]   There's voicemail in the UK though, right?
[01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:30.280]   Yeah, everybody uses voicemail, but most people will interact with, with SMS.
[01:05:30.280 --> 01:05:33.360]   And it's because it doesn't cost you anything to receive an SMS.
[01:05:33.360 --> 01:05:34.360]   Oh yeah.
[01:05:34.360 --> 01:05:35.360]   Oh, I see.
[01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:40.200]   So you can, and most, and, or you, you practically can't buy, you can't buy a voicemail these
[01:05:40.200 --> 01:05:41.200]   days.
[01:05:41.200 --> 01:05:43.360]   It doesn't come with, with messages built in.
[01:05:43.360 --> 01:05:45.920]   So you really, really struggle to spend a lot of money on texting.
[01:05:45.920 --> 01:05:50.240]   I mean, the iPhone comes with like, I don't know, a thousand messages a month or something,
[01:05:50.240 --> 01:05:51.240]   just as part of the plan.
[01:05:51.240 --> 01:05:53.720]   I paid the 20 bucks a month for unlimited texting.
[01:05:53.720 --> 01:05:55.360]   So I use it whenever I can.
[01:05:55.360 --> 01:05:56.360]   Right.
[01:05:56.360 --> 01:05:57.360]   Leo, Leo, Leo.
[01:05:57.360 --> 01:05:58.360]   What?
[01:05:58.360 --> 01:06:02.240]   You don't text, you don't answer email, you don't do anything.
[01:06:02.240 --> 01:06:04.120]   You just sit there and broadcast all day.
[01:06:04.120 --> 01:06:06.280]   Like, yeah, he says whenever you can.
[01:06:06.280 --> 01:06:07.280]   Whenever you can.
[01:06:07.280 --> 01:06:09.480]   Which is like, you know, once a day.
[01:06:09.480 --> 01:06:12.320]   No, actually, I do, I use text messaging.
[01:06:12.320 --> 01:06:13.840]   I text my kids and stuff.
[01:06:13.840 --> 01:06:14.840]   Kids really do.
[01:06:14.840 --> 01:06:15.840]   Right.
[01:06:15.840 --> 01:06:19.960]   John college kids and even teenagers in the US have discovered texting for a long time
[01:06:19.960 --> 01:06:20.960]   they did not text.
[01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:23.520]   Even when I was in college, it wasn't that.
[01:06:23.520 --> 01:06:24.520]   And that was.
[01:06:24.520 --> 01:06:25.520]   It's come on strongly.
[01:06:25.520 --> 01:06:26.520]   Now I think it's huge.
[01:06:26.520 --> 01:06:28.480]   Back then it wasn't as big.
[01:06:28.480 --> 01:06:29.480]   Yeah.
[01:06:29.480 --> 01:06:30.480]   The whole SMS thing.
[01:06:30.480 --> 01:06:31.480]   Well, I believe me.
[01:06:31.480 --> 01:06:33.120]   I paid for unlimited for Henry.
[01:06:33.120 --> 01:06:34.120]   Yeah.
[01:06:34.120 --> 01:06:35.720]   You know, Abby told me she's in France right now.
[01:06:35.720 --> 01:06:39.680]   She says, because it's so expensive to make cell phone calls, nobody makes calls.
[01:06:39.680 --> 01:06:40.680]   They text.
[01:06:40.680 --> 01:06:41.680]   That's all they do.
[01:06:41.680 --> 01:06:42.680]   Yeah.
[01:06:42.680 --> 01:06:43.680]   I found this in India too.
[01:06:43.680 --> 01:06:44.680]   I found it in India.
[01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:45.680]   I found it in India.
[01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:46.680]   I found it in India.
[01:06:46.680 --> 01:06:47.680]   I found it in India.

[01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:41.680]   I found it in India.
[01:12:41.680 --> 01:12:42.680]   There are people in America.
[01:12:42.680 --> 01:12:44.640]   Kids are not getting well educated.
[01:12:44.640 --> 01:12:51.120]   We need more students from India in particular, China, to be able to come here to college
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:52.680]   and then we don't let them come here to work.
[01:12:52.680 --> 01:12:57.520]   Google said we could hire, you know, we could get the engineers we need, but they won't
[01:12:57.520 --> 01:12:58.520]   let us.
[01:12:58.520 --> 01:12:59.520]   They won't give us visas.
[01:12:59.520 --> 01:13:02.960]   They highlighted one Google engineer who did have a visa to work in the United States,
[01:13:02.960 --> 01:13:05.560]   but they're both Indian nationals.
[01:13:05.560 --> 01:13:06.880]   His wife did not.
[01:13:06.880 --> 01:13:10.480]   So they live in Canada because he can't work.
[01:13:10.480 --> 01:13:11.480]   He's in the Google Maps division.
[01:13:11.480 --> 01:13:15.520]   He works out of the Google sales office in Vancouver.
[01:13:15.520 --> 01:13:21.840]   I tell you, you know, something interesting when I was in Delhi, we had to fill out some
[01:13:21.840 --> 01:13:27.800]   paperwork at the consulate there.
[01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:32.200]   And it was interesting because, you know, you see lines for every country there.
[01:13:32.200 --> 01:13:34.400]   The longest line was for the United States.
[01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:35.880]   I mean, they had the UK.
[01:13:35.880 --> 01:13:39.560]   They had, you know, all kinds of random countries.
[01:13:39.560 --> 01:13:44.440]   They're all in the same area, but the very longest line was for the United States.
[01:13:44.440 --> 01:13:45.440]   People want to come here.
[01:13:45.440 --> 01:13:46.440]   They want to study.
[01:13:46.440 --> 01:13:47.440]   They want to come here.
[01:13:47.440 --> 01:13:49.760]   Everyone in the line was very like young, I would say.
[01:13:49.760 --> 01:13:54.280]   I think it's interesting because we do have, I think, a crappy secondary school system,
[01:13:54.280 --> 01:13:56.320]   but we have a very good college system.
[01:13:56.320 --> 01:13:58.480]   We probably have the best university system in the world.
[01:13:58.480 --> 01:14:00.680]   Oddly enough, I don't know how that happened.
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:03.120]   So kids, they go to school in India.
[01:14:03.120 --> 01:14:04.120]   They learn their math.
[01:14:04.120 --> 01:14:05.120]   Yeah.
[01:14:05.120 --> 01:14:06.120]   They to the 50.
[01:14:06.120 --> 01:14:07.120]   With the abacus.
[01:14:07.120 --> 01:14:08.120]   Yeah.
[01:14:08.120 --> 01:14:11.120]   They're not allowed to stay here and work.
[01:14:11.120 --> 01:14:12.920]   I have a cousin who's actually doing that.
[01:14:12.920 --> 01:14:17.000]   He's getting his masters in engineering at the University of Florida.
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:23.360]   And he's very smart, but, you know, he can't stay here after he's done with it.
[01:14:23.360 --> 01:14:29.320]   He's a professor of physics at the University of Toronto says very succinctly, private wealth
[01:14:29.320 --> 01:14:30.320]   public squalor.
[01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:32.200]   I guess that's true.
[01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:36.560]   Although you went to University of California, which is a very good public school, state-run
[01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:37.560]   school.
[01:14:37.560 --> 01:14:39.480]   And one of the best schools in the country.
[01:14:39.480 --> 01:14:42.680]   And I felt like, I thought that education was quite good.
[01:14:42.680 --> 01:14:46.200]   And I had a lot of friends who were in the EECS program or the electrical engineering
[01:14:46.200 --> 01:14:47.800]   computer science program.
[01:14:47.800 --> 01:14:48.800]   Very competitive.
[01:14:48.800 --> 01:14:49.880]   You're a Cal fan, right, John?
[01:14:49.880 --> 01:14:51.440]   And I went to Cal, too.
[01:14:51.440 --> 01:14:52.440]   Yeah.
[01:14:52.440 --> 01:14:53.440]   All right.
[01:14:53.440 --> 01:14:54.440]   He was in the...
[01:14:54.440 --> 01:14:56.560]   When I got my degree in history, I bailed out of the engineering side of things.
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:14:57.560]   I couldn't handle it.
[01:14:57.560 --> 01:14:58.560]   And they're not...
[01:14:58.560 --> 01:14:59.560]   It's very competitive.
[01:14:59.560 --> 01:15:00.560]   It's too competitive.
[01:15:00.560 --> 01:15:01.560]   It's very hard.
[01:15:01.560 --> 01:15:02.560]   I...
[01:15:02.560 --> 01:15:03.560]   But was it like that?
[01:15:03.560 --> 01:15:04.560]   So all these Asian kids went there?
[01:15:04.560 --> 01:15:05.560]   No social life.
[01:15:05.560 --> 01:15:07.040]   They come over here and boom, they just kick your ass.
[01:15:07.040 --> 01:15:09.280]   What are you supposed to do?
[01:15:09.280 --> 01:15:11.560]   You were there in the late '60s, mid-60s.
[01:15:11.560 --> 01:15:13.840]   I was there back in the '20s.
[01:15:13.840 --> 01:15:14.840]   Were there...
[01:15:14.840 --> 01:15:15.840]   Were there...
[01:15:15.840 --> 01:15:16.840]   He was taking his bike.
[01:15:16.840 --> 01:15:18.880]   He was just building this school back when I went.
[01:15:18.880 --> 01:15:21.920]   Were there a lot of Asian students there when you went there?
[01:15:21.920 --> 01:15:23.360]   It was all engineering.
[01:15:23.360 --> 01:15:24.360]   It was all Asian.
[01:15:24.360 --> 01:15:25.520]   It was all from China.
[01:15:25.520 --> 01:15:27.760]   And they just basically worked all day and worked all night.
[01:15:27.760 --> 01:15:28.760]   They never went out.
[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:30.920]   They never went on dates and never showed up at parties and never did anything.
[01:15:30.920 --> 01:15:31.920]   They didn't do anything.
[01:15:31.920 --> 01:15:34.120]   They said, "Work and study, work and study, work and study and go back to China."
[01:15:34.120 --> 01:15:39.040]   And then next thing you know, we're getting these and they're marching off.
[01:15:39.040 --> 01:15:40.520]   There's still many students who were...
[01:15:40.520 --> 01:15:45.960]   Even in my day when I was there, there was a lot of that as well for in students.
[01:15:45.960 --> 01:15:46.960]   I think it's worse now.
[01:15:46.960 --> 01:15:47.960]   I thought.
[01:15:47.960 --> 01:15:48.960]   I was actually surprised to hear it.
[01:15:48.960 --> 01:15:50.760]   Was that way even back in the backage?
[01:15:50.760 --> 01:15:52.360]   Yeah, I didn't know that either.
[01:15:52.360 --> 01:15:53.360]   Oh yeah.
[01:15:53.360 --> 01:15:54.360]   Oh yeah.
[01:15:54.360 --> 01:16:00.400]   Now it's actually more Asian because they've got sick of the white kids coming in there
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:02.200]   and then causing riots.
[01:16:02.200 --> 01:16:03.200]   So let me...
[01:16:03.200 --> 01:16:06.080]   I'm going to pose a question that I'm going to take a break.
[01:16:06.080 --> 01:16:10.720]   But the question you may based your lamb, your leg of lamb, John, but the question I'm
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:14.680]   going to pose you is, well, if you were going to graduate school today and you had your
[01:16:14.680 --> 01:16:22.880]   choice of anything you would like to study, what would be the number one, the fastest growing
[01:16:22.880 --> 01:16:29.600]   graduate school profession, the one that has the best future, this is going to shock
[01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:30.600]   you.
[01:16:30.600 --> 01:16:31.600]   We'll talk about it in just a second.
[01:16:31.600 --> 01:16:34.000]   I want to mention my friends that go to my PC.
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:35.160]   These are the folks at Citrix.
[01:16:35.160 --> 01:16:36.160]   Go to my PC.
[01:16:36.160 --> 01:16:39.600]   It's a very, very cool remote access program.
[01:16:39.600 --> 01:16:43.360]   It's really, as far as I'm concerned, the best remote access out there.
[01:16:43.360 --> 01:16:46.600]   G-O-T-O-M-Y-P-C.com.
[01:16:46.600 --> 01:16:47.600]   It has to be.
[01:16:47.600 --> 01:16:48.600]   There are free choices.
[01:16:48.600 --> 01:16:52.800]   I know there are free choices out there for you for remote access.
[01:16:52.800 --> 01:16:59.520]   So how does somebody create a product that you pay for by making it easier to use, by
[01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:07.160]   making it faster, by making it work on any computer anywhere and absolutely securely?
[01:17:07.160 --> 01:17:10.960]   There have been a lot of remote access exploits you might have read about in the last few
[01:17:10.960 --> 01:17:11.960]   months.
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:13.300]   Not go to my PC.
[01:17:13.300 --> 01:17:14.400]   These guys know what they're doing.
[01:17:14.400 --> 01:17:17.680]   It is totally secure, 128-bit SSL encryption.
[01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:22.560]   The beauty of Go to my PC is complete net traversal.
[01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:24.400]   The way it works is you can do it right now.
[01:17:24.400 --> 01:17:27.880]   Go to my PC.com/twit.
[01:17:27.880 --> 01:17:28.880]   That's the website.
[01:17:28.880 --> 01:17:31.720]   Go to my PC.com/twit.
[01:17:31.720 --> 01:17:33.240]   For free, you can sign up for 30 days.
[01:17:33.240 --> 01:17:34.240]   Now, here's the beauty.
[01:17:34.240 --> 01:17:35.520]   It takes a couple of minutes to sign up.
[01:17:35.520 --> 01:17:36.520]   You'll notice immediately.
[01:17:36.520 --> 01:17:37.520]   I didn't have to configure the router.
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:39.000]   I don't have to open ports.
[01:17:39.000 --> 01:17:40.000]   No.
[01:17:40.000 --> 01:17:42.920]   You may for the other guys you don't because it's using full net traversal.
[01:17:42.920 --> 01:17:47.560]   Now, anywhere you go, anywhere you can get online, whether it's at home, they go home
[01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:53.120]   early, whether it's an internet cafe, even a sketch internet cafe in India, at Agra,
[01:17:53.120 --> 01:17:58.680]   whether it's at AirPort or a hotel, you log on to go to my PC.com.
[01:17:58.680 --> 01:18:02.760]   We have a 128-bit SSL encrypted connection.
[01:18:02.760 --> 01:18:06.200]   They pass you on to your office computer.
[01:18:06.200 --> 01:18:09.000]   You are now point-to-point encrypted to your office computer.
[01:18:09.000 --> 01:18:11.080]   You could do anything you would do if you were sitting there.
[01:18:11.080 --> 01:18:12.080]   You see it full screen.
[01:18:12.080 --> 01:18:16.280]   So you can send and receive email, run programs, access resources.
[01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:19.400]   It's effectively a VPN.
[01:18:19.400 --> 01:18:23.600]   By the way, you could surf the net too completely securely, even in the most sketch of places.
[01:18:23.600 --> 01:18:27.760]   PC World gave it their world class award for best remote access software.
[01:18:27.760 --> 01:18:28.760]   It's that good.
[01:18:28.760 --> 01:18:33.240]   You know, sometimes people worry about security in new technologies.
[01:18:33.240 --> 01:18:38.280]   If you've been worried, maybe something the example they use in the online banking, it
[01:18:38.280 --> 01:18:41.760]   took people a while to feel like it was safe to do that.
[01:18:41.760 --> 01:18:45.160]   If you've been worried about that, let me tell you, the security on GoToMyPC is the
[01:18:45.160 --> 01:18:49.000]   best you can get and Citrix knows this stuff.
[01:18:49.000 --> 01:18:51.320]   Fast, easy, secure.
[01:18:51.320 --> 01:18:52.320]   It's a simple pitch.
[01:18:52.320 --> 01:18:54.000]   I want you to try it free for 30 days.
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:19:02.520]   Go to g-o-t-o-m-y-p-c-dot-com/twit and try it absolutely free.
[01:19:02.520 --> 01:19:10.600]   So newspapers are going under, magazines going under, the blogger, it's the age of the blogger.
[01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:23.400]   So according to the Pew Research Center, 5,000 newspaper jobs gone in 2008.
[01:19:23.400 --> 01:19:31.360]   Since 2001, more than 10,000 journalists out of work, 47,000 unemployed.
[01:19:31.360 --> 01:19:39.320]   And yet journalism programs cannot make enough room for new journalism students.
[01:19:39.320 --> 01:19:45.760]   Columbia Stanford and NYU applications up 38%, 20% and 6% respectively from the previous
[01:19:45.760 --> 01:19:46.760]   year.
[01:19:46.760 --> 01:19:53.360]   University of Colorado up 11%, University of North Carolina up 14%, Maryland up 25%.
[01:19:53.360 --> 01:19:54.840]   What's going on?
[01:19:54.840 --> 01:19:59.840]   People are spending the average price for graduate school, including living expenses,
[01:19:59.840 --> 01:20:02.760]   $31,000 a year.
[01:20:02.760 --> 01:20:04.840]   The best they can hope for.
[01:20:04.840 --> 01:20:08.800]   Getting a job 40,000 a year as a journalist.
[01:20:08.800 --> 01:20:10.200]   And there aren't that many jobs.
[01:20:10.200 --> 01:20:12.320]   What are they thinking?
[01:20:12.320 --> 01:20:14.840]   Would you go to J-School today?
[01:20:14.840 --> 01:20:15.840]   Nehaar, did you--
[01:20:15.840 --> 01:20:17.600]   What did you study in Nehaar College?
[01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:19.080]   I have a confession to make.
[01:20:19.080 --> 01:20:20.080]   What?
[01:20:20.080 --> 01:20:21.840]   I actually applied to grad school.
[01:20:21.840 --> 01:20:22.840]   For journalism?
[01:20:22.840 --> 01:20:24.920]   I changed to do it at Berkeley.
[01:20:24.920 --> 01:20:25.920]   Yep.
[01:20:25.920 --> 01:20:26.920]   Why?
[01:20:26.920 --> 01:20:28.920]   And I practically was basically--
[01:20:28.920 --> 01:20:29.920]   What?
[01:20:29.920 --> 01:20:32.360]   --we listed and they told me to reapply next term.
[01:20:32.360 --> 01:20:34.160]   Because it was oversold.
[01:20:34.160 --> 01:20:35.160]   Yeah.
[01:20:35.160 --> 01:20:36.160]   And but you know what?
[01:20:36.160 --> 01:20:37.760]   Now I'm kind of like, what was I thinking?
[01:20:37.760 --> 01:20:41.040]   Do I really want to be that much in debt two years from now?
[01:20:41.040 --> 01:20:45.200]   Like do I seriously-- I mean, why did I even make that decision?
[01:20:45.200 --> 01:20:47.040]   And again, I think grad school is a great thing.
[01:20:47.040 --> 01:20:50.640]   And I think I did it because at that time I felt like that would be the right thing
[01:20:50.640 --> 01:20:53.400]   to do.
[01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:55.480]   But I'm not shocked.
[01:20:55.480 --> 01:20:59.080]   I think what's happening here is I think a lot of people feel like, OK, I don't know
[01:20:59.080 --> 01:21:00.080]   what I'm doing.
[01:21:00.080 --> 01:21:01.640]   I'm like a journalist or whatever.
[01:21:01.640 --> 01:21:02.640]   I'm a blog blogger.
[01:21:02.640 --> 01:21:04.640]   You think it's bloggers who do this who say I just want to get a--
[01:21:04.640 --> 01:21:07.400]   I just want to think, OK, well I need a little bit more cred.
[01:21:07.400 --> 01:21:10.600]   So I can go to J-School, buy me some cred.
[01:21:10.600 --> 01:21:11.600]   OK.
[01:21:11.600 --> 01:21:13.080]   At 31,000 a year.
[01:21:13.080 --> 01:21:14.080]   At 31,000.
[01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:19.600]   Be in debt that I'll never pay off with my 45K job that I get out of grad school.
[01:21:19.600 --> 01:21:24.920]   But I couldn't tell you what I-- personally I was thinking when I decided to apply to
[01:21:24.920 --> 01:21:25.920]   J-School.
[01:21:25.920 --> 01:21:33.320]   I mean, I'd love to see bloggers and online journalists have that training, I guess.
[01:21:33.320 --> 01:21:34.760]   Why, John, what do you think?
[01:21:34.760 --> 01:21:35.760]   What's going on here?
[01:21:35.760 --> 01:21:36.760]   I don't know if you're saying--
[01:21:36.760 --> 01:21:37.760]   I've taught it to Cal.
[01:21:37.760 --> 01:21:44.800]   Not as a professor, but as a guest lecturer with Markoff and Greg Zachary were teaching
[01:21:44.800 --> 01:21:45.800]   at Cal.
[01:21:45.800 --> 01:21:48.720]   And of course, then they'd begin teaching at Stanford.
[01:21:48.720 --> 01:21:51.640]   And it's interesting because the students that come through, they're kind of generational.
[01:21:51.640 --> 01:21:53.720]   Every group is different.
[01:21:53.720 --> 01:22:00.960]   But I don't know what the value of it would be to a blogger.
[01:22:00.960 --> 01:22:05.520]   I mean, I think that you couldn't get elsewhere.
[01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:09.680]   And the other thing is, there's nothing like on the job training.
[01:22:09.680 --> 01:22:14.840]   Taking a bunch of graduate courses in journalism is different than getting a job at a newspaper
[01:22:14.840 --> 01:22:17.600]   someplace where you actually have people yelling at you.
[01:22:17.600 --> 01:22:19.240]   That's a good point.
[01:22:19.240 --> 01:22:20.240]   That's a very good point.
[01:22:20.240 --> 01:22:21.240]   There's patience.
[01:22:21.240 --> 01:22:24.840]   That's like going to the Columbia School of Broadcasting and then becoming a DJ.
[01:22:24.840 --> 01:22:25.840]   There's not--
[01:22:25.840 --> 01:22:30.040]   Yeah, or even actually even the Paul Allen School of Broadcasting was more valuable because
[01:22:30.040 --> 01:22:32.640]   you were on the air for years.
[01:22:32.640 --> 01:22:33.640]   And--
[01:22:33.640 --> 01:22:37.160]   Actually, that's where I got my degree at the Paul Allen School of Broadcasting.
[01:22:37.160 --> 01:22:38.160]   I don't know.
[01:22:38.160 --> 01:22:43.160]   I was just saying that nothing works like experience, especially when it comes to writing.
[01:22:43.160 --> 01:22:48.640]   It's J School copper-- is that going to count in any way?
[01:22:48.640 --> 01:22:50.200]   I don't think it's going to do you any good at this.
[01:22:50.200 --> 01:22:51.200]   What about ethics?
[01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:59.480]   What about learning kind of the collected wisdom of journalists over the years?
[01:22:59.480 --> 01:23:00.480]   Isn't there something to be gained?
[01:23:00.480 --> 01:23:02.040]   They teach you that in undergrad too.
[01:23:02.040 --> 01:23:07.440]   I mean, one of my core classes in my Mass Call major was an ethics course.
[01:23:07.440 --> 01:23:08.440]   I'm glad to hear that.
[01:23:08.440 --> 01:23:11.800]   I mean, that's one thing you could say bloggers don't have.
[01:23:11.800 --> 01:23:12.800]   That's true.
[01:23:12.800 --> 01:23:18.480]   I would think that undergraduate-- I don't know what the point of the graduate school is.
[01:23:18.480 --> 01:23:26.200]   I mean, one or two courses in journalism as an undergrad and working on the school paper.
[01:23:26.200 --> 01:23:29.600]   And you can always get-- I mean, I wrote it for the Daily Cal.
[01:23:29.600 --> 01:23:34.240]   And is really all you really need from then on.
[01:23:34.240 --> 01:23:38.080]   You can just pick it up on the job or whatever.
[01:23:38.080 --> 01:23:42.760]   The problem is that in the United States, everybody wants to think of journalism as
[01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:46.800]   a profession, whereas in most of the rest of the world in England in particular is thought
[01:23:46.800 --> 01:23:47.800]   of as a trade.
[01:23:47.800 --> 01:23:48.800]   It's true.
[01:23:48.800 --> 01:23:49.800]   I'm a bricklayer.
[01:23:49.800 --> 01:23:52.320]   And it's like, yeah, well, that's what it is.
[01:23:52.320 --> 01:23:54.160]   And it's not rocket science.
[01:23:54.160 --> 01:23:56.080]   And I don't think you have to be a genius to be a real fighter.
[01:23:56.080 --> 01:23:57.800]   It is a kind of a dumb job.
[01:23:57.800 --> 01:23:58.800]   I mean, you know--
[01:23:58.800 --> 01:23:59.800]   It's a skill.
[01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:00.800]   It's completely skill.
[01:24:00.800 --> 01:24:01.800]   It's a craft in that sense.
[01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:02.800]   It's a skill in talent.
[01:24:02.800 --> 01:24:03.800]   It's a craft in that sense, right?
[01:24:03.800 --> 01:24:04.800]   Yeah, because it has both of those.
[01:24:04.800 --> 01:24:05.800]   It's not a message.
[01:24:05.800 --> 01:24:06.800]   It's like being a painter.
[01:24:06.800 --> 01:24:09.200]   Now, academics.
[01:24:09.200 --> 01:24:14.320]   I guess you're the wrong guy to ask your Will Harris, because you went to school to be
[01:24:14.320 --> 01:24:15.320]   a lawyer.
[01:24:15.320 --> 01:24:16.320]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:24:16.320 --> 01:24:17.880]   A lot of good that did you.
[01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:19.480]   I don't get it now, I sense.
[01:24:19.480 --> 01:24:23.200]   The barrister Will Harris will now respond for the crowns.
[01:24:23.200 --> 01:24:28.480]   But I think that it's a lot of the sort of up-- because I see it a lot and up taking
[01:24:28.480 --> 01:24:29.960]   people wanting to do journalism.
[01:24:29.960 --> 01:24:35.640]   I think it's because a lot of teenagers and school kids are getting a taste for publishing
[01:24:35.640 --> 01:24:40.880]   online and for having their stuff, you know, red and having their thoughts put out there.
[01:24:40.880 --> 01:24:43.360]   And it makes them think about journalism in a way.
[01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:48.000]   It's blocking the social media revolution and such.
[01:24:48.000 --> 01:24:51.840]   It's kind of made journalism a bit sexier, possibly, than it was before.
[01:24:51.840 --> 01:24:55.760]   A bit more attractive to people to get involved with.
[01:24:55.760 --> 01:25:01.880]   However, I absolutely agree with John that taking a post-ground journalism course is
[01:25:01.880 --> 01:25:03.280]   kind of mental at this point.
[01:25:03.280 --> 01:25:08.360]   You'd be far better off just going and getting a job, getting any kind of job, any kind of
[01:25:08.360 --> 01:25:12.560]   freelance posting your own essays to your blog and then using that to get yourself a
[01:25:12.560 --> 01:25:19.200]   gig somewhere is far more valuable actual experience than going and getting a grad course
[01:25:19.200 --> 01:25:20.200]   for sure.
[01:25:20.200 --> 01:25:24.760]   And let's mention one more thing about journalism.
[01:25:24.760 --> 01:25:27.760]   College of schools or whatever, like the Columbia School of Journalism.
[01:25:27.760 --> 01:25:34.320]   Originally, they were brought into professionalize the trade and it was done in a way and in
[01:25:34.320 --> 01:25:38.160]   fact, most people that really take a lot of journalism and get a degree in it.
[01:25:38.160 --> 01:25:41.280]   It was designed to create cogs for cogs in the wheel.
[01:25:41.280 --> 01:25:43.960]   So you'd have like a neutral writing style with no voice.
[01:25:43.960 --> 01:25:44.960]   You weren't really a writer.
[01:25:44.960 --> 01:25:45.960]   You were a journalist.
[01:25:45.960 --> 01:25:46.960]   You were a reporter.
[01:25:46.960 --> 01:25:47.960]   You knew how to do it.
[01:25:47.960 --> 01:25:48.960]   You couldn't.
[01:25:48.960 --> 01:25:50.280]   You could work at any newspaper.
[01:25:50.280 --> 01:25:52.560]   You would fit right into this game of things.
[01:25:52.560 --> 01:25:53.960]   You weren't a columnist.
[01:25:53.960 --> 01:25:57.560]   You weren't somebody trying to express themselves.
[01:25:57.560 --> 01:25:58.880]   You were just this cog in the wheel.
[01:25:58.880 --> 01:26:05.080]   You were trained and just like a lawyer to be able to do a job anywhere.
[01:26:05.080 --> 01:26:06.080]   And that was the idea.
[01:26:06.080 --> 01:26:09.840]   And so you end up with a whole bunch of people that are overtrained in journalism.
[01:26:09.840 --> 01:26:11.000]   And this is a controversial thing.
[01:26:11.000 --> 01:26:12.720]   I'm saying some people will deny it.
[01:26:12.720 --> 01:26:15.560]   But the fact is very few of them can do much more than report.
[01:26:15.560 --> 01:26:18.200]   They're good reporters, but they're not authors.
[01:26:18.200 --> 01:26:19.920]   They're very few of them become novelists.
[01:26:19.920 --> 01:26:21.480]   A few of them can break away from it.
[01:26:21.480 --> 01:26:26.160]   But generally speaking, they write in a voiceless style that anybody can read.
[01:26:26.160 --> 01:26:31.320]   It's fairly neutral and they're taught the principles of neutrality, even though it's
[01:26:31.320 --> 01:26:33.040]   hard to maintain.
[01:26:33.040 --> 01:26:35.160]   And it doesn't apply anymore.
[01:26:35.160 --> 01:26:36.320]   The whole world's changed.
[01:26:36.320 --> 01:26:37.320]   This is not going to fly.
[01:26:37.320 --> 01:26:43.440]   We think the probably partisan writing is going to probably return to the fore, which
[01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:48.160]   it was in the 1800s where newspapers used to be like the press Democrat.
[01:26:48.160 --> 01:26:50.160]   It used to be on one side of an issue.
[01:26:50.160 --> 01:26:51.920]   And there were papers that are independent.
[01:26:51.920 --> 01:26:52.920]   That kind of thing.
[01:26:52.920 --> 01:26:55.280]   Everybody had a political perspective in these papers.
[01:26:55.280 --> 01:26:57.000]   And that's where it's headed with blogging.
[01:26:57.000 --> 01:26:58.480]   It's also where it's heading with television.
[01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:01.720]   Gosh, you wouldn't start a news channel unless you could figure out where you were right
[01:27:01.720 --> 01:27:03.200]   left or center.
[01:27:03.200 --> 01:27:04.200]   Right.
[01:27:04.200 --> 01:27:05.200]   These days.
[01:27:05.200 --> 01:27:09.640]   I think it's interesting too, because when I was talking to them to see what they were
[01:27:09.640 --> 01:27:15.840]   looking for, my experience is mostly in the internet spectrum.
[01:27:15.840 --> 01:27:20.600]   All the writing that I've done has been in that kind of blogging creative style.
[01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:25.360]   And ultimately it seems like the board or whoever's designing who gets admission into
[01:27:25.360 --> 01:27:29.800]   grad school, they're looking for people who are like newspaper journalists or people who
[01:27:29.800 --> 01:27:34.440]   are much more traditional, which was fascinating to me because that's not the future.
[01:27:34.440 --> 01:27:36.400]   But you were zed.
[01:27:36.400 --> 01:27:38.600]   Very within the last three years.
[01:27:38.600 --> 01:27:39.600]   Wow.
[01:27:39.600 --> 01:27:40.600]   Yeah.
[01:27:40.600 --> 01:27:41.600]   So that was eye opening for me.
[01:27:41.600 --> 01:27:44.120]   And maybe you're lucky you didn't get in, to be honest with you.
[01:27:44.120 --> 01:27:45.120]   I'm thinking so.
[01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:48.680]   You spent a lot of money and getting trained in a profession that's dying.
[01:27:48.680 --> 01:27:49.680]   Exactly.
[01:27:49.680 --> 01:27:53.920]   I think that I really need, perhaps I don't really need that training.
[01:27:53.920 --> 01:27:56.160]   And I got it working at places.
[01:27:56.160 --> 01:27:57.160]   Yeah.
[01:27:57.160 --> 01:27:58.160]   You know.
[01:27:58.160 --> 01:28:03.360]   My daughter said she wants to learn the family business by going to Emerson and studying
[01:28:03.360 --> 01:28:04.360]   the broadcast program.
[01:28:04.360 --> 01:28:06.560]   And I said, "That ain't this family's business.
[01:28:06.560 --> 01:28:08.560]   I don't know what business that is."
[01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:11.520]   What do you think your dad is Johnny Walker?
[01:28:11.520 --> 01:28:17.400]   It might be fun to go to like, I mean, if I was thinking about it and I had to go to
[01:28:17.400 --> 01:28:22.920]   a big school, maybe San Diego State, which has a good broadcasting program where UCLA,
[01:28:22.920 --> 01:28:25.640]   USC for maybe a movie career.
[01:28:25.640 --> 01:28:29.480]   But I would just say, just go to, for people that just are floating around and thinking,
[01:28:29.480 --> 01:28:33.440]   find a good junior college like, you know, college is San Mateo.
[01:28:33.440 --> 01:28:39.160]   And just go there for a year and just take broadcasting and a few other things like that.
[01:28:39.160 --> 01:28:40.880]   And work in the studio because they're on the air.
[01:28:40.880 --> 01:28:45.400]   I mean, that's the closest, that station is as good as almost anything going on around
[01:28:45.400 --> 01:28:46.400]   the Bay Area.
[01:28:46.400 --> 01:28:47.400]   Yeah.
[01:28:47.400 --> 01:28:48.400]   It's surprisingly good.
[01:28:48.400 --> 01:28:49.400]   I really wonder.
[01:28:49.400 --> 01:28:55.240]   I mean, we're in such a state of flux now, but I really wonder if you have such an opportunity
[01:28:55.240 --> 01:29:02.400]   now to get your chops in the actual environment, whether it's doing a podcast or a video streaming
[01:29:02.400 --> 01:29:06.360]   or on a blog writing, it almost seems like that's the best way to learn.
[01:29:06.360 --> 01:29:08.520]   And isn't that how journalists used to learn?
[01:29:08.520 --> 01:29:09.520]   It wasn't great.
[01:29:09.520 --> 01:29:11.760]   Yeah, they used to be taken under somebody's wing.
[01:29:11.760 --> 01:29:12.920]   It was a predatory ship.
[01:29:12.920 --> 01:29:13.920]   Yeah.
[01:29:13.920 --> 01:29:18.160]   Here, I mean, let's face it, you're a little operation over there is not coming from some
[01:29:18.160 --> 01:29:21.680]   guy who doesn't know anything, who's never been around the block, who's never worked
[01:29:21.680 --> 01:29:24.280]   in the business, who doesn't have a broadcasting background.
[01:29:24.280 --> 01:29:27.400]   It's like extremely professional for a reason.
[01:29:27.400 --> 01:29:31.480]   Other people I've seen, I don't see anybody else bringing up, you know, their game up
[01:29:31.480 --> 01:29:36.360]   to the level that you have that are ranked amateurs and don't have any help whatsoever
[01:29:36.360 --> 01:29:37.360]   for anybody.
[01:29:37.360 --> 01:29:38.360]   No, you're right.
[01:29:38.360 --> 01:29:39.360]   There needs to be more mentoring going on.
[01:29:39.360 --> 01:29:44.440]   You know, I've always mentored as much as I can and invited people in and said, here's
[01:29:44.440 --> 01:29:46.800]   how we do it and giving them feedback.
[01:29:46.800 --> 01:29:49.080]   I mean, yeah, I think that that's important.
[01:29:49.080 --> 01:29:54.240]   I remember when I got into broadcasting, you know, I never went to broadcast school.
[01:29:54.240 --> 01:29:57.760]   I just did it and I was pretty awful for the first five years.
[01:29:57.760 --> 01:29:59.800]   And I remember trying to get my school.
[01:29:59.800 --> 01:30:01.200]   Is this five years?
[01:30:01.200 --> 01:30:02.720]   No, no, I didn't go to school.
[01:30:02.720 --> 01:30:04.120]   I mean, it was the school of hard knocks.
[01:30:04.120 --> 01:30:06.320]   I mean, you know, can I be honest?
[01:30:06.320 --> 01:30:09.320]   I was terrible for the first 10 years I was on the I was one of those guys.
[01:30:09.320 --> 01:30:11.040]   You know, hey, welcome to the show.
[01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:12.440]   We're going to have a great show for you.
[01:30:12.440 --> 01:30:13.440]   Coming up and just a little bit.
[01:30:13.440 --> 01:30:15.240]   We're going to play a little music for Steely Dad.
[01:30:15.240 --> 01:30:17.480]   But right now it's the Doobie Brothers.
[01:30:17.480 --> 01:30:20.080]   Jesus is just all right.
[01:30:20.080 --> 01:30:21.840]   You had the total announce, your voice.
[01:30:21.840 --> 01:30:22.840]   I like it.
[01:30:22.840 --> 01:30:24.160]   You should go back to that.
[01:30:24.160 --> 01:30:25.640]   Maybe that was my future.
[01:30:25.640 --> 01:30:32.600]   Anyway, I do remember when I was starting out that there was this ethos and that the
[01:30:32.600 --> 01:30:38.280]   people who are doing it right now would would take you under their wing and teach you and
[01:30:38.280 --> 01:30:39.280]   bring you up.
[01:30:39.280 --> 01:30:43.040]   And I think that that certain and they always said to me, you know, I'm going to take you
[01:30:43.040 --> 01:30:44.040]   under my wing.
[01:30:44.040 --> 01:30:45.040]   I'm going to mentor you.
[01:30:45.040 --> 01:30:48.480]   I'm going to show you what I know at broadcasting, but you got to pass it along.
[01:30:48.480 --> 01:30:49.480]   You got to pass it.
[01:30:49.480 --> 01:30:50.480]   Pay it forward.
[01:30:50.480 --> 01:30:51.480]   I think that's true.
[01:30:51.480 --> 01:30:52.480]   I think it's very true.
[01:30:52.480 --> 01:30:55.840]   And I think I mean, I feel very lucky to have had mentors just mentors that I made
[01:30:55.840 --> 01:30:57.120]   actually at tech TV.
[01:30:57.120 --> 01:30:58.680]   I mean, like it wasn't me.
[01:30:58.680 --> 01:31:01.640]   I was walking around my underwear drunk by the time you got there.
[01:31:01.640 --> 01:31:07.040]   No, I mean, like for example, like Sarah, Sarah Lane has been mentored to me even.
[01:31:07.040 --> 01:31:08.040]   Well, I mentored her.
[01:31:08.040 --> 01:31:09.040]   So it all works out.
[01:31:09.040 --> 01:31:10.040]   Yeah.
[01:31:10.040 --> 01:31:13.080]   And even at revision three, she she mentored me as well.
[01:31:13.080 --> 01:31:14.640]   I still I still look at her.
[01:31:14.640 --> 01:31:16.200]   There is that spirit, isn't there?
[01:31:16.200 --> 01:31:17.360]   There's still is that spirit.
[01:31:17.360 --> 01:31:22.760]   And if and there's been people who are interns when I worked at revision three, I tried to,
[01:31:22.760 --> 01:31:26.200]   you know, pass on the torch and teach them whatever I know to.
[01:31:26.200 --> 01:31:30.680]   I wonder if the sham while guy has taken mentees on because I'm thinking that might
[01:31:30.680 --> 01:31:31.680]   be my future.
[01:31:31.680 --> 01:31:32.680]   I think it'd be great.
[01:31:32.680 --> 01:31:34.480]   I'd love to do that.
[01:31:34.480 --> 01:31:35.480]   Hey, camera guy.
[01:31:35.480 --> 01:31:36.480]   Look at this.
[01:31:36.480 --> 01:31:37.480]   I'd love to do that.
[01:31:37.480 --> 01:31:39.760]   I'm kind of doing that anyway.
[01:31:39.760 --> 01:31:41.760]   Yeah, I am a pitch guy.
[01:31:41.760 --> 01:31:44.840]   There's a certain amount of that has to happen.
[01:31:44.840 --> 01:31:47.200]   You know, monster cable is added again.
[01:31:47.200 --> 01:31:50.480]   They are suing a company called Monster Transmission.
[01:31:50.480 --> 01:31:53.440]   I don't know why you would get confused.
[01:31:53.440 --> 01:31:54.840]   Monster Transmission.
[01:31:54.840 --> 01:32:01.440]   That when you go to Monster Transmission and Performance in Florida, that you would think
[01:32:01.440 --> 01:32:07.160]   you're maybe buying high priced over some say overpriced cables from Monster Cable.
[01:32:07.160 --> 01:32:09.640]   Remember, they also see well, you know, here it is.
[01:32:09.640 --> 01:32:12.080]   I think I got the answer.
[01:32:12.080 --> 01:32:16.840]   The cables transmit data and electricity.
[01:32:16.840 --> 01:32:20.840]   And so transmission is a word that they could employ in their sales pitch.
[01:32:20.840 --> 01:32:25.640]   And so someone might be confused by Monster Transmission.
[01:32:25.640 --> 01:32:27.320]   I learned a little bit about this.
[01:32:27.320 --> 01:32:30.080]   We have we have a lawyer now.
[01:32:30.080 --> 01:32:35.600]   Because there are a few companies that are doing streaming stuff with the word "twit."
[01:32:35.600 --> 01:32:41.440]   And while the Twitter is a different area, they have a trade.
[01:32:41.440 --> 01:32:42.440]   Actually, they don't.
[01:32:42.440 --> 01:32:43.960]   You know what else I've found out?
[01:32:43.960 --> 01:32:45.600]   They don't have a trademark yet.
[01:32:45.600 --> 01:32:47.360]   Oh, that's interesting.
[01:32:47.360 --> 01:32:49.600]   But it's been pending for a couple of years.
[01:32:49.600 --> 01:32:51.800]   I don't know what's going on.
[01:32:51.800 --> 01:32:58.120]   Anyway, so we want to stop people from doing any streaming media or podcasts or any audio
[01:32:58.120 --> 01:33:02.000]   entertainment or video entertainment under the name "twit" of any kind, even if it's
[01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:03.320]   about Twitter.
[01:33:03.320 --> 01:33:08.400]   So I talked to the lawyer and he said, "The only way you can sue in this case is if people
[01:33:08.400 --> 01:33:11.320]   could be reasonably confused about what they're getting."
[01:33:11.320 --> 01:33:12.320]   You know?
[01:33:12.320 --> 01:33:13.320]   Yeah.
[01:33:13.320 --> 01:33:14.800]   So if somebody does "twit shoes," there's no confusion.
[01:33:14.800 --> 01:33:16.680]   It's a different business.
[01:33:16.680 --> 01:33:20.000]   Nobody's thinking they're getting "twit the podcast" or "Twitter the microblog" when they
[01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:21.960]   buy "twit shoes."
[01:33:21.960 --> 01:33:24.760]   So I don't know how Monster even can justify this.
[01:33:24.760 --> 01:33:25.760]   It's just out of...
[01:33:25.760 --> 01:33:27.120]   It seems far-fetched.
[01:33:27.120 --> 01:33:29.240]   It's also bad PR.
[01:33:29.240 --> 01:33:32.120]   The whole geek community is down on these guys now.
[01:33:32.120 --> 01:33:33.120]   Well...
[01:33:33.120 --> 01:33:34.120]   It's not the first time though.
[01:33:34.120 --> 01:33:37.560]   Oh, what a real geek would use their stuff.
[01:33:37.560 --> 01:33:38.560]   Well, that's true.
[01:33:38.560 --> 01:33:39.560]   It's just expensive.
[01:33:39.560 --> 01:33:40.560]   That's a good point.
[01:33:40.560 --> 01:33:42.480]   It's overpriced.
[01:33:42.480 --> 01:33:44.680]   They apparently want to own the name "Monster."
[01:33:44.680 --> 01:33:48.600]   So you're not going to hear any monster podcasts coming out of here, that's for sure.
[01:33:48.600 --> 01:33:50.000]   The Monster Movie.
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:51.600]   The Monster Microblogging service.
[01:33:51.600 --> 01:33:52.600]   Monster Microblogging.
[01:33:52.600 --> 01:33:54.320]   Yeah, I just go to monoprice.com.
[01:33:54.320 --> 01:33:55.320]   They've never sued anybody.
[01:33:55.320 --> 01:33:56.320]   Yeah.
[01:33:56.320 --> 01:33:59.040]   The worst for this is Intel.
[01:33:59.040 --> 01:34:04.480]   Intel is absolutely dreadful at going around and trying to suit anybody that has the word
[01:34:04.480 --> 01:34:07.640]   "intel" in any context in the domain name or their company.
[01:34:07.640 --> 01:34:11.960]   Of course, Intel is really commonly used as an abbreviation for intelligence, like for
[01:34:11.960 --> 01:34:12.960]   the intelligence community.
[01:34:12.960 --> 01:34:19.720]   So there's all kind of websites that are all about next-generation Intel or whatever.com.
[01:34:19.720 --> 01:34:22.720]   And they get sued out of existence by Intel.
[01:34:22.720 --> 01:34:23.720]   Interesting.
[01:34:23.720 --> 01:34:24.720]   I didn't know that.
[01:34:24.720 --> 01:34:30.960]   It has some of the most hardcore trademark and copyright guys around.
[01:34:30.960 --> 01:34:37.720]   You can Google any number of websites that have got sort of valid Intel complaints.
[01:34:37.720 --> 01:34:42.720]   Well, on that note.
[01:34:42.720 --> 01:34:45.520]   No, no, there's a couple of more notes.
[01:34:45.520 --> 01:34:47.160]   You want to go based your lamb?
[01:34:47.160 --> 01:34:48.160]   Go ahead.
[01:34:48.160 --> 01:34:50.000]   There's a couple more notes.
[01:34:50.000 --> 01:34:53.560]   One is, I don't think we talked about this last week.
[01:34:53.560 --> 01:34:54.560]   What do we did?
[01:34:54.560 --> 01:35:00.920]   Actually, we did talk about Time Warner lowering these caps, introducing 50 gigabyte caps in
[01:35:00.920 --> 01:35:06.480]   some countries, or some counties or cities, some regions in the United States, which is
[01:35:06.480 --> 01:35:08.080]   a ridiculously low number.
[01:35:08.080 --> 01:35:13.520]   But now it comes out that they perhaps are going to offer tier pricing.
[01:35:13.520 --> 01:35:15.080]   So this is kind of a one-two punch.
[01:35:15.080 --> 01:35:19.200]   They first tell places like Austin, Texas, "We're going to limit you to 50 gigabytes
[01:35:19.200 --> 01:35:20.440]   a month."
[01:35:20.440 --> 01:35:26.880]   And then they say, "Oh, but if you're willing to pay $150, you can have unlimited download."
[01:35:26.880 --> 01:35:29.720]   We've kind of gone back and forth about this before John, you and I.
[01:35:29.720 --> 01:35:32.800]   Does that seem like a good solution to bandwidth caps?
[01:35:32.800 --> 01:35:34.560]   It's just tier the pricing and...
[01:35:34.560 --> 01:35:37.360]   Well, that's always been your argument.
[01:35:37.360 --> 01:35:38.360]   Yeah.
[01:35:38.360 --> 01:35:40.000]   Yeah, you've always wanted to do that.
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:41.560]   So you're not going to try to do it.
[01:35:41.560 --> 01:35:44.000]   You're trying to get me to drop my argument.
[01:35:44.000 --> 01:35:45.920]   No, I don't want it to be that way.
[01:35:45.920 --> 01:35:53.960]   But I think that if you are going to offer caps, you've got to have some rational tiering
[01:35:53.960 --> 01:35:55.440]   going on.
[01:35:55.440 --> 01:35:58.600]   I mean, 50 gigabyte cap is ridiculous, John.
[01:35:58.600 --> 01:36:03.680]   You couldn't listen to all my shows if you had a 50 gigabyte cap.
[01:36:03.680 --> 01:36:04.680]   I don't know.
[01:36:04.680 --> 01:36:09.920]   I have a meter on my system and it monitors my usage.
[01:36:09.920 --> 01:36:11.640]   And I think, and I'm a pretty heavy user.
[01:36:11.640 --> 01:36:13.000]   I don't listen to all your shows.
[01:36:13.000 --> 01:36:14.000]   I mean, I should.
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:17.080]   Yeah, you should.
[01:36:17.080 --> 01:36:18.080]   But I also...
[01:36:18.080 --> 01:36:19.400]   All your shows, see, there you do.
[01:36:19.400 --> 01:36:21.520]   You match as many as I...
[01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:22.720]   Max 30 gigs a month.
[01:36:22.720 --> 01:36:23.720]   Max.
[01:36:23.720 --> 01:36:26.160]   I can't make myself getting more than 30 gigs a month.
[01:36:26.160 --> 01:36:27.160]   Really?
[01:36:27.160 --> 01:36:28.160]   All right.
[01:36:28.160 --> 01:36:34.440]   Well, apparently they're planning, they say 30% of our customers use less than a gigabyte.
[01:36:34.440 --> 01:36:37.880]   They're going to offer a $15 a month high speed internet.
[01:36:37.880 --> 01:36:39.760]   Well, relatively high speed.
[01:36:39.760 --> 01:36:44.880]   It's a 768 kilobits upload, 128 kilobits for $15 a month.
[01:36:44.880 --> 01:36:47.680]   I think that's great.
[01:36:47.680 --> 01:36:51.920]   But if you go over that gigabyte, it's $2 a gigabyte additional.
[01:36:51.920 --> 01:36:57.840]   They will also have a 10 gigabyte, 20 gigabyte, 40 gigabyte and 60 gigabyte caps.
[01:36:57.840 --> 01:37:02.440]   And so you, and 100 for it, let's say you want 100 gigabytes, 75 bucks a month, 10 megabits
[01:37:02.440 --> 01:37:05.240]   per second uploads at one megabit.
[01:37:05.240 --> 01:37:07.480]   This to me kind of makes sense.
[01:37:07.480 --> 01:37:10.840]   I have to say this is the way to handle it.
[01:37:10.840 --> 01:37:11.840]   What is your argument?
[01:37:11.840 --> 01:37:14.760]   You think it should be unlimited?
[01:37:14.760 --> 01:37:15.760]   Me?
[01:37:15.760 --> 01:37:17.400]   No, you don't, do you?
[01:37:17.400 --> 01:37:22.600]   No, I thought it should be charged by the bit, but that's a reasonable solution.
[01:37:22.600 --> 01:37:25.760]   Instead of charging by the bit, just say, here's your max.
[01:37:25.760 --> 01:37:28.600]   Yeah, there are people that don't use it a lot to just use email.
[01:37:28.600 --> 01:37:31.000]   Why are they paying these high ridiculous prices?
[01:37:31.000 --> 01:37:33.880]   I think they should have fast access.
[01:37:33.880 --> 01:37:37.200]   Everyone should have the same blazing speeds.
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:40.640]   And if you're not going to use it that much, you shouldn't be paying for it.
[01:37:40.640 --> 01:37:45.040]   I feel sorry for people that you got one guy next door who was just hogging bandwidth
[01:37:45.040 --> 01:37:47.600]   and going crazy and downloading everything they can.
[01:37:47.600 --> 01:37:49.280]   And then somebody else just does email.
[01:37:49.280 --> 01:37:51.480]   I mean, why are they paying this in a minute?
[01:37:51.480 --> 01:37:52.480]   It makes me sense.
[01:37:52.480 --> 01:37:54.240]   I'm actually coming around to your way of thinking.
[01:37:54.240 --> 01:37:57.640]   Your position was, well, it costs the company's money.
[01:37:57.640 --> 01:38:00.480]   I don't think it costs them as much as they like you to think it costs them.
[01:38:00.480 --> 01:38:02.840]   It costs the company's money to offer better service.
[01:38:02.840 --> 01:38:03.840]   So charge for better service.
[01:38:03.840 --> 01:38:06.200]   I don't think that's such a bad thing.
[01:38:06.200 --> 01:38:08.800]   Do you think that people are going to get caught up in the overages though?
[01:38:08.800 --> 01:38:10.600]   Yeah, I worry about that.
[01:38:10.600 --> 01:38:11.600]   Yeah.
[01:38:11.600 --> 01:38:12.600]   Well, yeah.
[01:38:12.600 --> 01:38:14.080]   I mean, I would worry about that too.
[01:38:14.080 --> 01:38:18.600]   That can end up expensive depending on what happens with softball plans.
[01:38:18.600 --> 01:38:22.880]   I just hate the whole concept of having an overage and an overage fee.
[01:38:22.880 --> 01:38:23.880]   I want to limit.
[01:38:23.880 --> 01:38:26.200]   I would buy whatever the unlimited was.
[01:38:26.200 --> 01:38:29.160]   Because I just don't want to be limited by anything.
[01:38:29.160 --> 01:38:30.160]   Right.
[01:38:30.160 --> 01:38:33.720]   And with this, you still, even though it's tier and perhaps it's better for people who
[01:38:33.720 --> 01:38:36.520]   just check their email are very minimal usage.
[01:38:36.520 --> 01:38:39.640]   But for those who have kind of normal use, it's...
[01:38:39.640 --> 01:38:43.880]   Well, it seems to me the way it should be done if you're going to use tiered is that
[01:38:43.880 --> 01:38:48.200]   if you have a low tier and you're subscribing and blah, blah, blah, and you all of a sudden
[01:38:48.200 --> 01:38:52.640]   jump to the overage mark, you should just be billed for the next tier.
[01:38:52.640 --> 01:38:53.640]   I don't see that.
[01:38:53.640 --> 01:38:59.240]   Yeah, it shouldn't be like an incremental overage thing, which is what this is.
[01:38:59.240 --> 01:39:04.680]   And which I'm describing is similar to my charge by the bit thing because essentially
[01:39:04.680 --> 01:39:11.000]   you'd have to pay more because you jumped over some sort of a plateau.
[01:39:11.000 --> 01:39:12.000]   So this is...
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:13.000]   I think this is sensible.
[01:39:13.000 --> 01:39:17.160]   So the top of the line service is 75 bucks a month.
[01:39:17.160 --> 01:39:22.440]   For that you get 100 gigabits, 100 gigabytes, as I mentioned, at 10 megabits per second
[01:39:22.440 --> 01:39:30.360]   down and one up, but a buck extra per gigabyte capped at 75.
[01:39:30.360 --> 01:39:33.680]   So now, by the way, they say this is just...
[01:39:33.680 --> 01:39:34.680]   We're trying this out.
[01:39:34.680 --> 01:39:36.160]   This is not...
[01:39:36.160 --> 01:39:38.320]   This may all change.
[01:39:38.320 --> 01:39:40.680]   But they say, so that's what I would probably get.
[01:39:40.680 --> 01:39:44.440]   I would get the 75 buck a month service.
[01:39:44.440 --> 01:39:46.000]   That's kind of the top of the line service.
[01:39:46.000 --> 01:39:49.880]   Knowing it could never go over 150 bucks, even if I just used a ton of bandwidth.
[01:39:49.880 --> 01:39:50.880]   Yeah.
[01:39:50.880 --> 01:39:55.840]   Well, I recommend people go on the net and find some of these meters so you can meter
[01:39:55.840 --> 01:39:56.840]   your own usage.
[01:39:56.840 --> 01:39:57.840]   Where do you get that?
[01:39:57.840 --> 01:39:58.840]   Yeah, where do you go?
[01:39:58.840 --> 01:40:01.080]   You know, I get on the other computer at the other house.
[01:40:01.080 --> 01:40:02.080]   I like that idea.
[01:40:02.080 --> 01:40:04.640]   Yeah, that's a great solution to this.
[01:40:04.640 --> 01:40:06.240]   I got sits there and it's just meters.
[01:40:06.240 --> 01:40:07.800]   But it only meters on that machine.
[01:40:07.800 --> 01:40:10.600]   It doesn't meter the whole network, I suppose, as someone that would.
[01:40:10.600 --> 01:40:14.320]   I'd love a meter that would meter everything coming into this room.
[01:40:14.320 --> 01:40:16.080]   Yeah, there's probably something.
[01:40:16.080 --> 01:40:18.240]   I mean, if you look around there, there are meters.
[01:40:18.240 --> 01:40:22.760]   They're just, you know, essentially counting bits, flies across the network.
[01:40:22.760 --> 01:40:23.760]   Right.
[01:40:23.760 --> 01:40:26.760]   I mean, we use a ton of bandwidth here.
[01:40:26.760 --> 01:40:28.960]   Ton of bandwidth.
[01:40:28.960 --> 01:40:30.720]   There's probably some sniffer that would do it.
[01:40:30.720 --> 01:40:33.480]   What's your internet cost you, Will?
[01:40:33.480 --> 01:40:34.480]   Will sinking?
[01:40:34.480 --> 01:40:36.560]   Are you getting lower and lower on the screen?
[01:40:36.560 --> 01:40:39.040]   We got Sansera's gotten to you.
[01:40:39.040 --> 01:40:41.040]   Ah, I took it again.
[01:40:41.040 --> 01:40:43.440]   You know what?
[01:40:43.440 --> 01:40:49.040]   It's like 20 quid a month, 20 quid a month, I think, for 10 down, 1 up.
[01:40:49.040 --> 01:40:50.040]   That's pretty good.
[01:40:50.040 --> 01:40:51.440]   Is there a bandwidth cap?
[01:40:51.440 --> 01:40:52.440]   Not bad.
[01:40:52.440 --> 01:40:55.080]   Ah, if there is, I've never encountered it.
[01:40:55.080 --> 01:40:59.040]   It's one of those things where they call it unlimited, but with like fair use.
[01:40:59.040 --> 01:41:00.040]   Right.
[01:41:00.040 --> 01:41:01.440]   And your fair use is never really quite defined.
[01:41:01.440 --> 01:41:04.840]   But I download quad lot, as you might expect, and I've never really encountered it.
[01:41:04.840 --> 01:41:06.800]   Well, you and I are kind of in the same business.
[01:41:06.800 --> 01:41:08.960]   We offer rich bandwidth content.
[01:41:08.960 --> 01:41:13.080]   You channel flip is, you know, if people downloaded everything you did, that could add
[01:41:13.080 --> 01:41:14.080]   up.
[01:41:14.080 --> 01:41:15.680]   So you must have a dog.
[01:41:15.680 --> 01:41:16.680]   Yeah.
[01:41:16.680 --> 01:41:18.880]   I mean, you must care a little bit.
[01:41:18.880 --> 01:41:24.320]   Well, what I mean, what we have over here that's kind of interesting is that, I mean,
[01:41:24.320 --> 01:41:28.280]   I don't have a bandwidth cap, but routinely packages are sold on the amount that you can
[01:41:28.280 --> 01:41:29.280]   download.
[01:41:29.280 --> 01:41:32.880]   So most people, if they buy the standard package from, you know, the standard operator will
[01:41:32.880 --> 01:41:34.960]   have like a 10 gigabyte cap.
[01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:37.800]   And that's just like, you know, they'll pay 10 quid a month, they'll get 10 gig.
[01:41:37.800 --> 01:41:38.800]   And that's it.
[01:41:38.800 --> 01:41:41.160]   They might pay 15 quid a month and get a 50 gig.
[01:41:41.160 --> 01:41:42.160]   And that's it.
[01:41:42.160 --> 01:41:44.960]   And that's how you can get an unlimited cap.
[01:41:44.960 --> 01:41:49.520]   There's no differentiator in speed only in the amount that you can download.
[01:41:49.520 --> 01:41:56.960]   But we tend to not see any effect of that though, because the people who really want
[01:41:56.960 --> 01:42:00.400]   the extra bandwidth will just pay the extra five quid and get it.
[01:42:00.400 --> 01:42:01.400]   Wow.
[01:42:01.400 --> 01:42:05.800]   Hey, I'm just seeing a guardian 653 in our chat room.
[01:42:05.800 --> 01:42:08.440]   He's using the tomato router, which is firmware.
[01:42:08.440 --> 01:42:12.960]   We actually run the firmware on our Lynxis WRT 54G.
[01:42:12.960 --> 01:42:15.680]   And it does monitor your monthly bandwidth use.
[01:42:15.680 --> 01:42:19.320]   He says he listens to most of the shows watches, or rather watches most of the shows live on
[01:42:19.320 --> 01:42:23.600]   Twitch 92 gigabytes a month.
[01:42:23.600 --> 01:42:27.560]   So it's possible out of the house for God's sake.
[01:42:27.560 --> 01:42:29.000]   Get some sunshine.
[01:42:29.000 --> 01:42:35.280]   I look at the graphs of the data, you know, that we're, you know, sucking for people watching
[01:42:35.280 --> 01:42:39.360]   on, you know, we have three channels that you stream, stick cam and bit gravity.
[01:42:39.360 --> 01:42:44.640]   And we're doing two or three terabytes a day now in video.
[01:42:44.640 --> 01:42:47.920]   So if I had to pay for that, I'd be in real trouble.
[01:42:47.920 --> 01:42:49.000]   That's a lot of video.
[01:42:49.000 --> 01:42:50.800]   That's a lot of video.
[01:42:50.800 --> 01:42:52.200]   A lot of video.
[01:42:52.200 --> 01:42:55.800]   All right, I'm going to 200 gigabytes at the warehouse.
[01:42:55.800 --> 01:43:00.680]   Colleen says she watches, she meters you with the tomato, probably the meter, the warehouse.
[01:43:00.680 --> 01:43:01.680]   And that's a bunch of users.
[01:43:01.680 --> 01:43:02.680]   How many different users?
[01:43:02.680 --> 01:43:03.680]   Where she where she lives?
[01:43:03.680 --> 01:43:04.680]   Three different users.
[01:43:04.680 --> 01:43:05.680]   You're a gigabyte someone.
[01:43:05.680 --> 01:43:09.480]   I don't want to know what you guys are.
[01:43:09.480 --> 01:43:12.320]   You're doing bit, you're using bit aren't you?
[01:43:12.320 --> 01:43:13.680]   That's without bit torrent.
[01:43:13.680 --> 01:43:15.080]   Wow.
[01:43:15.080 --> 01:43:16.640]   That's excluding the bit torrent traffic.
[01:43:16.640 --> 01:43:20.120]   She says they do it, not her.
[01:43:20.120 --> 01:43:21.920]   We want to make that perfectly clear.
[01:43:21.920 --> 01:43:22.920]   Colleen doesn't use torrents.
[01:43:22.920 --> 01:43:25.280]   Now it was so nice to see you to meet you.
[01:43:25.280 --> 01:43:32.720]   Although I guess I, I met you once when I was wandering around, drugged out of my head.
[01:43:32.720 --> 01:43:33.880]   The last, the final days.
[01:43:33.880 --> 01:43:35.640]   I don't know what they were doing to you.
[01:43:35.640 --> 01:43:39.840]   Well, the electric shock was really good after a while, I have to say.
[01:43:39.840 --> 01:43:41.040]   Yeah, it's been great.
[01:43:41.040 --> 01:43:42.880]   Just being here, it feels like home.
[01:43:42.880 --> 01:43:44.400]   So well it is.
[01:43:44.400 --> 01:43:45.400]   Consider it your home.
[01:43:45.400 --> 01:43:46.640]   I hope we can do this new show with you.
[01:43:46.640 --> 01:43:47.640]   I'd love to do it.
[01:43:47.640 --> 01:43:48.640]   I'm very excited about it.
[01:43:48.640 --> 01:43:49.640]   It would be great.
[01:43:49.640 --> 01:43:50.640]   It would be really fun.
[01:43:50.640 --> 01:43:52.480]   And I'd like to come back sometime.
[01:43:52.480 --> 01:43:55.760]   And it's been really great interacting with everybody in the IRC chat.
[01:43:55.760 --> 01:43:57.840]   It's been really good meeting everybody.
[01:43:57.840 --> 01:44:01.800]   And I hope you all, you know, keep in touch and stuff.
[01:44:01.800 --> 01:44:07.120]   AHA to worry.com, any H A T I W A R I dot com.
[01:44:07.120 --> 01:44:11.280]   Yeah, and also this week I probably will be doing a segment on DLTV.
[01:44:11.280 --> 01:44:12.280]   So that's cool.
[01:44:12.280 --> 01:44:13.480]   So DLTV is back up.
[01:44:13.480 --> 01:44:14.480]   It's back up.
[01:44:14.480 --> 01:44:16.800]   It's going to be a new format that they're trying out.
[01:44:16.800 --> 01:44:18.120]   Robert here is to be involved.
[01:44:18.120 --> 01:44:19.760]   He's still involved.
[01:44:19.760 --> 01:44:23.560]   It's going to be a twice weekly offering.
[01:44:23.560 --> 01:44:25.720]   And so I should hopefully be on the Thursday.
[01:44:25.720 --> 01:44:27.160]   Oh, I'm so glad to be here.
[01:44:27.160 --> 01:44:28.160]   Thursday edition.
[01:44:28.160 --> 01:44:30.840]   So I'm just doing some stuff there because I like it.
[01:44:30.840 --> 01:44:33.240]   I like the people that work at DLTV very much.
[01:44:33.240 --> 01:44:34.240]   Yeah.
[01:44:34.240 --> 01:44:39.800]   And obviously I'm going to be Colleen and I are going to try to work out and get void
[01:44:39.800 --> 01:44:43.560]   up and started, which should be super rad.
[01:44:43.560 --> 01:44:45.560]   V01D.tv.
[01:44:45.560 --> 01:44:46.560]   Yeah.
[01:44:46.560 --> 01:44:51.240]   So that's coming to an Internet's near you.
[01:44:51.240 --> 01:44:52.240]   Maybe this Internet right here.
[01:44:52.240 --> 01:44:53.240]   Maybe this one.
[01:44:53.240 --> 01:44:54.240]   Maybe this one.
[01:44:54.240 --> 01:44:55.240]   Right here.
[01:44:55.240 --> 01:44:56.240]   Yeah.
[01:44:56.240 --> 01:44:57.240]   I told you, I'll be glad to foot the bill on that.
[01:44:57.240 --> 01:44:58.240]   Yeah.
[01:44:58.240 --> 01:44:59.240]   And it'll be all about interactivity.
[01:44:59.240 --> 01:45:02.240]   That's something that I'm really big on as you guys could tell.
[01:45:02.240 --> 01:45:06.840]   They're going to do a multi-touch projector-based multi-touch display.
[01:45:06.840 --> 01:45:07.840]   Yeah.
[01:45:07.840 --> 01:45:10.360]   And really, I mean, it's for all levels of nerds.
[01:45:10.360 --> 01:45:15.120]   So don't feel frightened or don't feel like, "Oh, this is so basic."
[01:45:15.120 --> 01:45:16.120]   It's good for all.
[01:45:16.120 --> 01:45:18.760]   And also I'm on Twitter also.
[01:45:18.760 --> 01:45:21.200]   So @nehalia, N-E-H-A-L-I-A.
[01:45:21.200 --> 01:45:23.400]   Okay, I'm done plugging.
[01:45:23.400 --> 01:45:24.400]   @Nahalia.
[01:45:24.400 --> 01:45:25.400]   @nehalia.
[01:45:25.400 --> 01:45:26.400]   @nehalia.
[01:45:26.400 --> 01:45:27.400]   @nehalia.
[01:45:27.400 --> 01:45:28.400]   @nehalia.
[01:45:28.400 --> 01:45:30.960]   @willharris with 1L.
[01:45:30.960 --> 01:45:32.840]   You'll also find him a channel flip.
[01:45:32.840 --> 01:45:34.440]   Is that going well?
[01:45:34.440 --> 01:45:35.440]   Indeed you will.
[01:45:35.440 --> 01:45:36.440]   @channelflip.
[01:45:36.440 --> 01:45:37.960]   It's going very well.
[01:45:37.960 --> 01:45:43.120]   We've been delighted to have-- do you guys, in American or comedian called David Mitchell?
[01:45:43.120 --> 01:45:45.640]   No, another Ring of Bell.
[01:45:45.640 --> 01:45:46.640]   Okay.
[01:45:46.640 --> 01:45:49.880]   Very famous in the UK for being on the BBC.
[01:45:49.880 --> 01:45:53.280]   And he's the sort of UK version of John Hodgman, I suppose really.
[01:45:53.280 --> 01:45:57.360]   In fact, he was the PC in the UK version of the Mac and PC ads.
[01:45:57.360 --> 01:46:01.600]   Anyway, he's been doing a weekly series for us on Channel Flip.
[01:46:01.600 --> 01:46:04.880]   And it's been the most popular thing on iTunes for the past two months.
[01:46:04.880 --> 01:46:05.880]   Congratulations.
[01:46:05.880 --> 01:46:13.120]   Which is delightful to be beating out the BBC and all such other comers to be at the
[01:46:13.120 --> 01:46:14.200]   top of the iTunes chart.
[01:46:14.200 --> 01:46:16.360]   So that's very pleasing.
[01:46:16.360 --> 01:46:19.520]   We also have a podcast on you and with Rob Llewellyn.
[01:46:19.520 --> 01:46:20.520]   Yeah.
[01:46:20.520 --> 01:46:22.880]   He's doing a carpool, right?
[01:46:22.880 --> 01:46:24.120]   Is that part of your--
[01:46:24.120 --> 01:46:28.600]   So he's doing-- so he does carpool, but also does a weekly one for us called Machine of
[01:46:28.600 --> 01:46:34.680]   the Week, which is a weekly look at the coolest kind of electric vehicles and latest car tech.
[01:46:34.680 --> 01:46:35.680]   Which is very good fun.
[01:46:35.680 --> 01:46:36.680]   Oh, it's so cool.
[01:46:36.680 --> 01:46:39.360]   So you can watch both of those.
[01:46:39.360 --> 01:46:42.640]   Either you can get them through iTunes on the Channel Flip section on iTunes or you can
[01:46:42.640 --> 01:46:44.680]   just go to channelflip.com and watch them.
[01:46:44.680 --> 01:46:48.400]   Please give my best to Bobby Lew because-- and I'm so glad Red Dwarf came the new--
[01:46:48.400 --> 01:46:49.400]   Will do.
[01:46:49.400 --> 01:46:50.920]   I hear great things about it.
[01:46:50.920 --> 01:46:51.920]   That's neat.
[01:46:51.920 --> 01:46:52.920]   That's really exciting.
[01:46:52.920 --> 01:46:53.920]   Thank you.
[01:46:53.920 --> 01:46:54.920]   I'm John C. Devorek.
[01:46:54.920 --> 01:46:58.920]   It's at channeldevorek.com.
[01:46:58.920 --> 01:47:02.320]   I think in no small way influenced by channelflip.com.
[01:47:02.320 --> 01:47:06.080]   Actually, I'll get out of the blue.
[01:47:06.080 --> 01:47:07.080]   Channel.
[01:47:07.080 --> 01:47:10.040]   But maybe-- yeah, no, yeah, absolutely because I'm a big fan of Channel Flip.
[01:47:10.040 --> 01:47:11.040]   Now--
[01:47:11.040 --> 01:47:12.040]   Aw, you're a sweetheart.
[01:47:12.040 --> 01:47:13.040]   Yeah, you're a real Devorek.
[01:47:13.040 --> 01:47:15.600]   I need some more numbers on my thing.
[01:47:15.600 --> 01:47:17.840]   @therealdevorek on Twitter.
[01:47:17.840 --> 01:47:18.840]   Yep.
[01:47:18.840 --> 01:47:19.840]   @therealdevorek.
[01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:23.880]   And we thank the folks on Friend Feed because we are now doing kind of a Friend Feed.
[01:47:23.880 --> 01:47:28.200]   Room in our Twitter conversations room for every show.
[01:47:28.200 --> 01:47:29.320]   And it's a great way to interact.
[01:47:29.320 --> 01:47:32.880]   But also after the fact, to go back, see what people were saying and add your own comments
[01:47:32.880 --> 01:47:35.080]   to the show.
[01:47:35.080 --> 01:47:42.280]   Friendfeed.com/twit-conversations is the place to see that.
[01:47:42.280 --> 01:47:44.560]   We remind you that we are on iTunes.
[01:47:44.560 --> 01:47:47.320]   Like everybody else, just search for "Twit" in the iTunes store.
[01:47:47.320 --> 01:47:49.520]   We have a lot of different shows including this one.
[01:47:49.520 --> 01:47:55.600]   If you subscribe, you'll get it every week.
[01:47:55.600 --> 01:47:56.600]   Twitpix is online too at twit.tv/pix.
[01:47:56.600 --> 01:47:58.760]   Colleen picks great stuff that we mentioned on the shows and gives you a chance to pick
[01:47:58.760 --> 01:48:00.640]   it up and support Twitter at the same time.
[01:48:00.640 --> 01:48:01.640]   Not in all cases.
[01:48:01.640 --> 01:48:03.280]   Sometimes we don't make any money off it.
[01:48:03.280 --> 01:48:06.440]   But if it's on Amazon, we get the Amazon associate fee.
[01:48:06.440 --> 01:48:09.720]   And I'm not going to tell you my Twitter handle because I don't care.
[01:48:09.720 --> 01:48:10.720]   Thanks for joining us.
[01:48:10.720 --> 01:48:12.120]   We'll see you next week.
[01:48:12.120 --> 01:48:13.120]   Please be on it.
[01:48:13.120 --> 01:48:14.760]   I'm beyond over that.
[01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:16.920]   I'm so over Twitter.
[01:48:16.920 --> 01:48:17.920]   Another Twit.
[01:48:17.920 --> 01:48:18.920]   This is amazing.
[01:48:18.920 --> 01:48:19.920]   Join the camp.
[01:48:19.920 --> 01:48:21.920]   [Music]
