[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:55.480]   The panel has assembled Renee Ritchie.
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:02.840]   He's moonlightened from his role at Macbreak Weekly, also always in charge at imore.com
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.120]   and the host of Vector on the iMore network.
[00:02:05.120 --> 00:02:06.520]   Hello Renee, nice for you.
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:08.280]   Nice to see you on a Sunday.
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.280]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:10.280]   Well, I wasn't going to be here on Tuesday, Leo.
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.280]   So I felt I owed you.
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.280]   Thank you.
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.280]   I didn't make good.
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:14.280]   You got something going on Tuesday?
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.880]   I'm going to be in Brooklyn for some reason.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:20.040]   We'll talk about that in a sec.
[00:02:20.040 --> 00:02:26.240]   Also with Ed Bot, my old friend from the Bot Report at ZDNet, goes all the way back to
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:34.240]   -- we were just talking about this -- the Cobb Group PC World and PC Computing.
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.240]   Names that don't exist.
[00:02:37.240 --> 00:02:39.040]   They're all gone now, baby.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:40.760]   It don't exist anymore.
[00:02:40.760 --> 00:02:41.760]   Wow.
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:42.760]   Wow.
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:43.760]   Wow.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:44.760]   Someday, you know.
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:45.760]   Good to be back, Leo.
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:50.720]   And all the way to the right side of the table, it's Jason Heiner, Editor-in-Chief
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:51.720]   at Tech Republic.
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:52.720]   CBS Interactive.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:53.720]   Hi, Jason.
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:54.720]   Hey.
[00:02:54.720 --> 00:02:55.720]   Always good to be here.
[00:02:55.720 --> 00:02:56.720]   Thank you for having me.
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.720]   Nice to see you.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.040]   Jason's been growing a soul patch for November.
[00:03:02.040 --> 00:03:03.040]   It's nice.
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.040]   I like it.
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:05.040]   Yeah.
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:06.200]   I like it.
[00:03:06.200 --> 00:03:08.960]   I told him he really needs a pork pie hat, though, to go with that.
[00:03:08.960 --> 00:03:09.960]   It would really look good.
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:11.680]   I'm just enough fear to think with.
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.680]   Yeah.
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:13.680]   That's right.
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:14.680]   Yeah, just, you know.
[00:03:14.680 --> 00:03:17.400]   Well, some, some, some.
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:23.480]   So Tuesday at 10 a.m. Eastern time, Apple's going to be at the Brooklyn Academy of Music,
[00:03:23.480 --> 00:03:25.720]   Renee apparently got an invite.
[00:03:25.720 --> 00:03:29.120]   One of 370 different invite.
[00:03:29.120 --> 00:03:30.520]   Is that how many there were total?
[00:03:30.520 --> 00:03:35.520]   Oh, there's over 400, but I think only 370 have gone out to the press so far.
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:37.120]   So there's still chance for me?
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:40.800]   Well, I don't, I think the rest might just be in the venue because they've already put
[00:03:40.800 --> 00:03:43.280]   up the windows and they're putting up the...
[00:03:43.280 --> 00:03:44.440]   Yeah.
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:48.160]   This is, well, we don't know, but they're, what do they say?
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:50.320]   There's more in the making or something like that?
[00:03:50.320 --> 00:03:51.320]   Yeah.
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:52.320]   Yeah.
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:53.320]   And we're figuring iPads and Macs.
[00:03:53.320 --> 00:03:54.320]   iPads.
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:55.480]   And how serious are we figuring Macs?
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:56.480]   iPads for sure.
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:04:01.360]   I think Macs really seriously, the New Mac Mini, the replacement for the MacBook Air.
[00:04:01.360 --> 00:04:03.560]   I don't think, I don't think they'll even hint at the Mac Pro.
[00:04:03.560 --> 00:04:08.560]   I think they've learned their lesson about pre-announcing things before they ship, hopefully.
[00:04:08.560 --> 00:04:12.360]   But the New Mac Mini and the KB, sorry, the coffee lake, every time I go to sleep, we
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:14.320]   go and wake up and there's a new lake in the Intel family.
[00:04:14.320 --> 00:04:19.800]   But the coffee lake, not coffee lake revision or refresh, but the coffee lake versions of
[00:04:19.800 --> 00:04:21.160]   the iMac, the iMac.
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:23.080]   And I forget what Zion is on now.
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:25.120]   It was Skylake, so maybe now it's the on KB Lake.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:26.520]   So yeah, it's me on the radio show.
[00:04:26.520 --> 00:04:28.240]   So I have a pretty recent computer.
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:29.440]   It's 8th generation Intel.
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:30.440]   That's recent.
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:32.960]   I said, well, it depends which generation, 8th generation.
[00:04:32.960 --> 00:04:33.960]   I know.
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.840]   It's so confusing because there's KB Lake, KB Lake, refresh, coffee lake.
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:38.800]   And now they announced coffee lake refresh.
[00:04:38.800 --> 00:04:39.800]   But it hasn't shipped.
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.800]   I mean, it's just, it's Intel in 2018.
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:43.720]   Oh, I've just been handed my invitation.
[00:04:43.720 --> 00:04:45.320]   I'm so excited.
[00:04:45.320 --> 00:04:48.920]   Handmade with magic markers.
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:51.720]   But it looks like a four year old.
[00:04:51.720 --> 00:04:57.680]   Yeah, that's the most I can hope for.
[00:04:57.680 --> 00:04:58.680]   So good.
[00:04:58.680 --> 00:04:59.680]   We'll look forward to that.
[00:04:59.680 --> 00:05:02.840]   We're going to live stream at 7 AM Pacific 10 AM Eastern time.
[00:05:02.840 --> 00:05:04.160]   You got to get up early this time, Leo.
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:05.160]   1,300 UTC.
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:06.320]   Yeah, really early.
[00:05:06.320 --> 00:05:10.520]   Megan Moroni and I'll watch the live stream and comment on it.
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:12.960]   You won't be here for Mac break weekly, but we'll have an Mac.
[00:05:12.960 --> 00:05:14.280]   And I guess Andy's getting to go.
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:15.520]   And he said he got an invite too.
[00:05:15.520 --> 00:05:16.520]   Oh, awesome.
[00:05:16.520 --> 00:05:19.480]   I think it's going to be like March where they have a lot of extra curricular activities
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.480]   at the venue.
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:25.120]   They had a school event for the inexpensive iPad for education.
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:26.280]   And you had to go to class.
[00:05:26.280 --> 00:05:27.280]   You got like a--
[00:05:27.280 --> 00:05:28.280]   Yeah, they were real educators there.
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:30.400]   And they were teaching us with playgrounds and pages.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:34.680]   And then they had labs where you could do swift and fire drone and dissect the frog
[00:05:34.680 --> 00:05:37.680]   and AR and all these things.
[00:05:37.680 --> 00:05:38.680]   Could you--
[00:05:38.680 --> 00:05:39.520]   Could you--
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:40.760]   Could you say, hey, I got a file.
[00:05:40.760 --> 00:05:41.600]   I'll see you later.
[00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:43.800]   Could you just like--
[00:05:43.800 --> 00:05:46.120]   Well, I mean, a lot of people just go to these events.
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:46.720]   And then they leave.
[00:05:46.720 --> 00:05:49.000]   And like they go to the events, they get the hands on, they post their video, they
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.440]   get on the plane, they fly to the next event.
[00:05:51.440 --> 00:05:54.920]   But for good or for ill, I really only cover the Apple beat.
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:56.120]   So I get to stay there for a long haul.
[00:05:56.120 --> 00:05:58.440]   You get to stay the whole time.
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:00.480]   No other events for you to go to.
[00:06:00.480 --> 00:06:04.360]   Tomorrow will be the 1 plus event for their 6T.
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:06.600]   They had to move it.
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:10.160]   Because the last thing you want to do is do anything on Apple Day.
[00:06:10.160 --> 00:06:11.720]   They got big-footed.
[00:06:11.720 --> 00:06:15.160]   They got-- yeah, really stomped.
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:18.400]   So we'll have new phones to talk about this week.
[00:06:18.400 --> 00:06:19.640]   It won't stop this month, Leo.
[00:06:19.640 --> 00:06:22.240]   Like September and October has just been one thing after another.
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:24.840]   It's just crazy.
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.560]   I guess there's nothing more to say about that.
[00:06:26.560 --> 00:06:29.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:06:29.760 --> 00:06:32.360]   Maybe next week there'll be something to say about it.
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:33.760]   I feel-- am I jaded?
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:34.720]   I'm getting jaded.
[00:06:34.720 --> 00:06:35.240]   We're--
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:35.720]   No, don't be jaded.
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:36.680]   We're optimistically--
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:37.360]   We have to miss it.
[00:06:37.360 --> 00:06:40.160]   --the new technology, yes.
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:41.240]   We're getting rid of bezels.
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:42.920]   We're finally murdering all the bezels.
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:44.240]   It was not to love them.
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:45.240]   Buy bezels.
[00:06:45.240 --> 00:06:46.080]   I actually got my--
[00:06:46.080 --> 00:06:46.400]   They were offensive.
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:47.320]   They deserved to die.
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:48.720]   I got my 10R on Friday.
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:51.000]   And I do like it quite a bit, even though it has a little bit
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:51.560]   of a bezel.
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.120]   People are saying, oh, it's got too much bezel.
[00:06:53.120 --> 00:06:54.320]   It's got the little--
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:06:55.000]   little bezel.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:56.120]   Oh, it's too much bezel.
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:58.360]   LCD backlight is still hard.
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:06:59.120]   I like it.
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.080]   I think it's nice.
[00:07:00.080 --> 00:07:01.920]   It's the best battery life of any iPhone, right?
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:02.920]   Yeah.
[00:07:02.920 --> 00:07:05.040]   It's got a forgivable bezel.
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:05.880]   Very forgivable.
[00:07:05.880 --> 00:07:07.240]   I think it's highly forgivable.
[00:07:07.240 --> 00:07:08.680]   I think it's pretty.
[00:07:08.680 --> 00:07:12.120]   Although, once again, you know, that love the colors,
[00:07:12.120 --> 00:07:14.440]   the product read it as gorgeous.
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:15.640]   But you got to put it in a case.
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:17.240]   So what does it matter?
[00:07:17.240 --> 00:07:19.040]   Well, Apple didn't give you a case as timely.
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.240]   Oh, so you got the good score.
[00:07:20.240 --> 00:07:21.840]   No, they have--
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.400]   Aren't they doing like a plastic--
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.440]   They are, but no one can find them.
[00:07:25.440 --> 00:07:27.520]   They're MIA, so everyone has to buy an Otterbox case
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:28.840]   like an animal right now.
[00:07:28.840 --> 00:07:30.760]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:34.480]   I'm just going to carry it naked and hope I don't drop it,
[00:07:34.480 --> 00:07:35.800]   because it's glass and it's slippery.
[00:07:35.800 --> 00:07:37.560]   It'll be easy to--
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.600]   I mean, I'm surprised I haven't broken it already.
[00:07:39.600 --> 00:07:41.400]   It's not like-- I remember the Nexus 4.
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:43.560]   My boss and I put them in the middle of conference tables
[00:07:43.560 --> 00:07:46.120]   at CES and by the end of the meeting,
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:47.160]   they were both on the floor.
[00:07:47.160 --> 00:07:49.360]   It's not quite that slippery, but it's really close.
[00:07:49.360 --> 00:07:50.240]   It's pretty darn.
[00:07:50.240 --> 00:07:51.920]   Yeah.
[00:07:51.920 --> 00:07:52.760]   All right.
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:08:03.040]   We all decided we don't want to talk about the great tragedies
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:03.720]   in the world today.
[00:08:03.720 --> 00:08:06.960]   Although there is some complicity at Twitter,
[00:08:06.960 --> 00:08:09.080]   there is a site that was supposed
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:13.560]   to be the freedom of speech conservative site called GAB
[00:08:13.560 --> 00:08:15.240]   that pretty much everybody, as you're
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:16.720]   pulled their subscription, the credit card
[00:08:16.720 --> 00:08:19.480]   say you can't use it anymore to pay for it.
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:22.600]   GAB was where the anti-Semitic rantings of Illunatic
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:25.560]   were featured.
[00:08:25.560 --> 00:08:27.080]   I guess they're hosting company.
[00:08:27.080 --> 00:08:29.240]   They're hosting company.
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:31.000]   Shut them down also, giant.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:34.920]   So they'll be leaving giant on Monday.
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:38.240]   And their chief technology officer quit this morning.
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:40.240]   Good.
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:40.760]   Yeah.
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:41.800]   Good.
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:44.880]   Of course, the founders said it was the lying mainstream
[00:08:44.880 --> 00:08:45.880]   media's fault.
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.320]   So there's that.
[00:08:48.320 --> 00:08:51.120]   Damn human decency.
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:52.240]   Yeah, there's nothing more to say,
[00:08:52.240 --> 00:08:55.520]   except send our condolences and love
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:08:57.680]   and those much needed thoughts and prayers
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:08:59.280]   to everybody involved.
[00:08:59.280 --> 00:09:03.920]   And the words never again really do have tremendous meaning
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:04.640]   this week.
[00:09:04.640 --> 00:09:06.200]   Yes, they do.
[00:09:06.200 --> 00:09:07.200]   Yeah.
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:15.480]   Tim Cook says it's all the fault of the data industrial complex,
[00:09:15.480 --> 00:09:16.280]   as long as we're talking.
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:20.800]   Apple Tim was invited to speak at the 40th International
[00:09:20.800 --> 00:09:24.360]   Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners,
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:32.400]   the jauntily named ICDPPC, which is in Brussels.
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:36.640]   He gave the keynote and took it as an opportunity
[00:09:36.640 --> 00:09:41.960]   to say that the weaponization of big data
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:47.040]   is a problem and that artificial intelligence is really
[00:09:47.040 --> 00:09:48.880]   the bad actor for artificial intelligence
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:49.720]   to be truly smart.
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:52.800]   It must respect human values, including privacy.
[00:09:52.800 --> 00:09:56.640]   If we get this wrong, the dangers are profound.
[00:09:56.640 --> 00:09:59.400]   Somebody said, though, well, easy enough for Tim
[00:09:59.400 --> 00:10:04.520]   to take potshots at Google, which is clearly what this is.
[00:10:04.520 --> 00:10:10.520]   But he's also letting China do whatever it wants
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:14.320]   with Apple servers on iCloud.
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:19.680]   So it is a point to be made that you can say all this.
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:22.640]   But if you're letting China have access to iCloud data,
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:25.320]   I don't know if you're really supporting privacy.
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:27.640]   The interesting thing there is that he indicated
[00:10:27.640 --> 00:10:28.960]   there might be a shift in policy.
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:32.800]   So previously, with iOS 7, Apple went all in on fail secure.
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:34.160]   You could barely get into anything.
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:37.160]   And if you lost your recovery number, that was it.
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:38.120]   Apple could not help you.
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:39.240]   And then they got a lot of pushback,
[00:10:39.240 --> 00:10:41.000]   because we talked about this previously.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:43.680]   Some people, they don't care if anyone else gets their photos.
[00:10:43.680 --> 00:10:45.120]   You just better not lose their photo.
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:46.600]   That's the most important thing to them.
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:48.040]   And so Apple changed their policy.
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:50.760]   And now they have fail secure for anything that's real time
[00:10:50.760 --> 00:10:52.760]   and fail safe for anything that's in the backup.
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:54.360]   And he indicated in that speech,
[00:10:54.360 --> 00:10:55.920]   or I think in the comments following that speech,
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:57.280]   that Apple's reevaluating that.
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:59.080]   And it may be given the climate now.
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:01.080]   It'll be better to go to fail secure everywhere.
[00:11:01.080 --> 00:11:03.640]   Even if that means that they can't necessarily help somebody
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.360]   if they lose their access password or code
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:08.360]   or recovery digits or whatever.
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.800]   - Alex Stamos, who is the former Facebook
[00:11:10.800 --> 00:11:13.160]   chief information security officer, says,
[00:11:13.160 --> 00:11:15.160]   I agree with almost everything Tim Cook said
[00:11:15.160 --> 00:11:18.000]   in his privacy speech today, which is why it's so sad,
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:20.600]   to see the media credulously covering his statement
[00:11:20.600 --> 00:11:24.960]   without the context of Apple's action in China.
[00:11:24.960 --> 00:11:28.040]   Apple uses hardware rooted DRM to deny Chinese users
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:31.120]   the ability to install the VPN and E2E messaging apps,
[00:11:31.120 --> 00:11:33.040]   like Signal that would allow them to avoid
[00:11:33.040 --> 00:11:35.200]   pervasive censorship and surveillance.
[00:11:35.200 --> 00:11:38.480]   Apple moved iCloud data into a PRC controlled joint venture
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:41.160]   with unclear impacts.
[00:11:41.160 --> 00:11:43.520]   But he also points out China's an ethical blind spot
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:45.520]   for many in tech.
[00:11:45.520 --> 00:11:47.280]   We ignore the working conditions under which
[00:11:47.280 --> 00:11:48.600]   our beautiful devices are made,
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.400]   the censorship and surveillance.
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:54.000]   Necessary to ship apps there, the environmental externalities
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:56.640]   of cold powered Chinese Bitcoin farms.
[00:11:56.640 --> 00:12:00.680]   Cook is right, the US needs a strong privacy law
[00:12:00.680 --> 00:12:02.160]   and privacy regulator.
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:06.320]   But Apple needs to come clean on how iCloud works in China.
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:08.760]   - I mean, that's serious.
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:13.760]   - And Google already went through this dance
[00:12:13.760 --> 00:12:17.520]   a few years ago going into China
[00:12:17.520 --> 00:12:22.520]   and then exiting China for an extended period of time.
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:29.480]   And as I think everyone in that entire trillion dollar
[00:12:29.480 --> 00:12:35.240]   cohort has said along the way,
[00:12:35.240 --> 00:12:39.640]   China is this puzzle that there's no easy answer to.
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:44.320]   They represent such a huge part of the world
[00:12:44.320 --> 00:12:47.120]   that you can't ignore them.
[00:12:47.120 --> 00:12:51.480]   You can't just say, "Well, if you won't play by our rules,
[00:12:51.480 --> 00:12:53.840]   then we'll just stay out of your market."
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:58.840]   Because they're just too huge of a market.
[00:12:58.840 --> 00:13:02.400]   It's one of those conundrums that we need to be wrestling with
[00:13:02.400 --> 00:13:05.840]   and it's really good that we're having these conversations
[00:13:05.840 --> 00:13:09.240]   that we should have been having years and years ago.
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:11.160]   - Do you think though that Apple should,
[00:13:11.160 --> 00:13:12.200]   I hope you're right, Renee,
[00:13:12.200 --> 00:13:13.920]   that Apple's planning on doing something
[00:13:13.920 --> 00:13:15.760]   to step back a little bit
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:18.360]   and that Google should not be going back into China
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:19.680]   with sensor-searched?
[00:13:19.680 --> 00:13:22.840]   I mean, should American companies,
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:24.480]   you just point out how big a market is,
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:26.240]   turn their back on it?
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:27.480]   - I don't know.
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:32.480]   If you don't go into those markets,
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:39.000]   then you're denying billions of people
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:42.720]   access to transformative technology.
[00:13:42.720 --> 00:13:46.120]   If you do go into those markets under the terms
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:51.120]   that are being dictated by an increasingly autocratic regime,
[00:13:51.120 --> 00:13:57.520]   then you're complicit in things that are going to happen
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:01.840]   to the citizens of that country.
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:06.840]   So neither one of those things sounds like a good answer.
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:11.120]   It can't be a binary question.
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:11.960]   - Yeah.
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.920]   - Just isolation. - Just isolation.
[00:14:13.920 --> 00:14:15.880]   - Go ahead, Jason and then Renee.
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:17.720]   - Yeah, it's always the question, right?
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:22.720]   Like what will further the goals of the world,
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:26.800]   the better answer for the global community, right?
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:30.120]   Is it isolation when people are doing things
[00:14:30.120 --> 00:14:35.120]   that are regressive in human rights
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:41.200]   to their citizens, to other countries in some cases?
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:42.880]   Is it better to isolate them?
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:47.880]   Is it better to bring them into the global community
[00:14:47.880 --> 00:14:53.520]   and then put over time naturally pressure
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:54.840]   and gets put on them, right?
[00:14:54.840 --> 00:14:57.240]   That's the tactic that the Olympics takes.
[00:14:57.240 --> 00:15:00.120]   It's better to have them at the table
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:01.800]   than to have them off in their own room
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.120]   doing whatever they want, right, to their people.
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:08.680]   So it's playing out in tech
[00:15:08.680 --> 00:15:10.960]   because tech is a bigger part of the world
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:13.560]   and is becoming a bigger and bigger part of the world.
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:17.240]   I don't think it's possible for us at this point
[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:20.320]   to separate or completely isolate China.
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:24.000]   All of these big tech companies are so connected to them.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.640]   The question now is just sort of like,
[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:29.200]   how much do we give them a seat at the table
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:32.960]   versus how much do we have this sort of carrot and stick?
[00:15:32.960 --> 00:15:35.440]   Whereas like if you become,
[00:15:35.440 --> 00:15:38.920]   if you sort of do things that share our values,
[00:15:38.920 --> 00:15:41.480]   then we give you more and if you don't,
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:43.880]   we pull back.
[00:15:43.880 --> 00:15:45.480]   It's all a matter of degrees.
[00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:50.480]   Like there's no complete answer to completely isolate China
[00:15:50.480 --> 00:15:54.000]   and there probably never will be not in the future
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:56.000]   in the foreseeable future for now.
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:57.720]   - Renee.
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:15:58.840]   - Yeah, the only thing I wanted to add is that
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:01.000]   as far as I know, there's not too many differences
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:02.800]   in the way that Apple handles iCloud in China
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:04.400]   as opposed to outside China.
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:06.480]   The real-time stuff is all end-to-end encrypted
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.920]   and nobody has the keys to that, not even Apple.
[00:16:08.920 --> 00:16:12.160]   The backup stuff is the same as it is in the US.
[00:16:12.160 --> 00:16:15.400]   The US government can and has gone in and demanded the data
[00:16:15.400 --> 00:16:17.840]   and China can go in and demand that data.
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.240]   The only difference is inside America,
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:21.200]   we look at China is scary, we're inside China,
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.080]   they're like, we don't want our citizens the data
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:24.640]   to be stored on American servers.
[00:16:24.640 --> 00:16:26.360]   You're gonna spy on us, we don't trust you.
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:28.000]   And France is wanting repatriation
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.040]   and other countries are wanting redata repatriation,
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.680]   which is why we have the Cloud Act.
[00:16:31.680 --> 00:16:33.120]   It's becoming an increasing problem.
[00:16:33.120 --> 00:16:34.200]   And if those companies,
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:35.920]   Apple's got a longstanding policy
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.600]   of always being engaged, they truly believe
[00:16:37.600 --> 00:16:40.400]   they cannot affect change if they don't stay engaged.
[00:16:40.400 --> 00:16:43.520]   And there's gonna be pretty much every country or union
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:45.360]   in the world is gonna want their data localized
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:46.200]   at some point.
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.280]   So I think it's a bigger question.
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:48.720]   I mean, Microsoft was wrestling with it,
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:50.080]   Apple is wrestling with it,
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:51.560]   Google is off and on with it,
[00:16:51.560 --> 00:16:53.200]   but it's gonna have to be answered
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:55.600]   and it can't be just like, I'm a Canadian
[00:16:55.600 --> 00:16:57.800]   and I certainly don't want my data stored in the US,
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:16:59.160]   but frankly, anymore.
[00:16:59.160 --> 00:17:01.000]   So I don't know what we're all gonna do.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:01.840]   - Right.
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:06.120]   You know, there's another data point to toss in there,
[00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:07.200]   which is Twitter.
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:13.560]   And Twitter, let's think back to the glorious Arab Spring
[00:17:13.560 --> 00:17:20.600]   where it seemed like Twitter was doing an amazing job
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:26.400]   of mobilizing the forces of the people
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:31.240]   to rise up and demand democracy in their countries.
[00:17:31.240 --> 00:17:34.760]   And as we learned, I think just in the last week or two,
[00:17:34.760 --> 00:17:39.040]   that a lot of that data was being siphoned away
[00:17:39.040 --> 00:17:44.040]   that a Twitter employee had actually been recruited
[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:48.080]   by like the Saudi intelligence services
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:53.080]   to hand over the names and identifying details
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:57.920]   of people who were running anonymous
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:02.080]   or pseudonymous accounts that were involved
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:06.560]   in actions that were against the state.
[00:18:06.560 --> 00:18:09.960]   And so, you know, so at the time,
[00:18:09.960 --> 00:18:15.360]   all of the talk of Twitter was,
[00:18:15.360 --> 00:18:18.440]   look what a force for good Twitter is being here.
[00:18:18.440 --> 00:18:22.280]   And now years later with the benefit of hindsight,
[00:18:22.280 --> 00:18:24.520]   we look back on this and say, you know,
[00:18:24.520 --> 00:18:28.800]   how many people were arrested, imprisoned,
[00:18:28.800 --> 00:18:33.560]   and possibly executed as the result of all of that stuff.
[00:18:33.560 --> 00:18:37.200]   It really, you know, Renee is right.
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:40.720]   Encryption for a lot of this stuff is really crucial,
[00:18:40.720 --> 00:18:44.440]   but there's more to it than that.
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:48.680]   Identity is as important as anything.
[00:18:48.680 --> 00:18:51.120]   'Cause even if they can't see the content
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:53.960]   of what you're doing, if they can see the metadata
[00:18:53.960 --> 00:18:58.960]   or if they can see your account information
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:03.160]   and associate that with communications between point A
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:06.140]   and point B, you can get in a lot of trouble.
[00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:11.120]   - It's really been a terrible week for Silicon Valley.
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:11.960]   Yeah.
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:14.200]   In so many respects, there's of course,
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:16.920]   the debate over the Pentagon's $10 billion
[00:19:16.920 --> 00:19:19.320]   Jedi Cloud contract.
[00:19:19.320 --> 00:19:22.480]   Google said, well, we're not gonna bid on it.
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:24.320]   Amazon is likely to get it.
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:29.000]   Amazon employees have signed petitions saying,
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.160]   Amazon shouldn't be selling face recognition tech to police.
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:34.520]   Many employees say Amazon shouldn't be bidding
[00:19:34.520 --> 00:19:36.400]   on this cloud contract.
[00:19:36.400 --> 00:19:40.480]   Jeff Bezos said, I'm happy to bid on this contract.
[00:19:40.480 --> 00:19:42.720]   And you know, in a way, I can't exactly,
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:47.520]   he says sometimes one of the jobs of senior leadership
[00:19:47.520 --> 00:19:50.240]   is to make the right decision, even when that's unpopular.
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:52.520]   If big tech companies are gonna turn their back
[00:19:52.520 --> 00:19:54.600]   on the US Department of Defense,
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:55.960]   this country is gonna be in trouble.
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:59.280]   And actually, I thought that was a compelling argument.
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:02.800]   So we, this stuff is so tough.
[00:20:02.800 --> 00:20:05.680]   And of course, Silicon Valley is under a microscope.
[00:20:05.680 --> 00:20:08.880]   Everybody's looking at what Silicon Valley does.
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:11.760]   And I honestly feel like there's nothing,
[00:20:11.760 --> 00:20:14.720]   it's almost nothing these big companies can do
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:18.040]   that's gonna not put them under further scrutiny.
[00:20:18.040 --> 00:20:19.920]   Take the contract or not.
[00:20:19.920 --> 00:20:22.800]   Text becomes so central to everything we do.
[00:20:22.800 --> 00:20:24.960]   - Right, it's part of the mainstream now, isn't it?
[00:20:24.960 --> 00:20:25.800]   - Yeah.
[00:20:25.800 --> 00:20:29.960]   - It is intrinsic in every part of business,
[00:20:29.960 --> 00:20:31.080]   in every part of government,
[00:20:31.080 --> 00:20:32.600]   in every part of healthcare.
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:36.360]   And it's become that way, you know, so quickly,
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:38.600]   almost overnight, right, in a matter of decades.
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:40.880]   I mean, all of us, obviously,
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:43.280]   you've been talking about this story for a long time,
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:46.240]   knew it was coming, have seen parts of it happen.
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:48.600]   But we're at the point where it has gotten
[00:20:48.600 --> 00:20:51.880]   mission critical everywhere and part of everything.
[00:20:51.880 --> 00:20:56.000]   And so it's now, there are problems
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.320]   and the tech industry's been so focused on innovation
[00:20:59.320 --> 00:21:02.120]   specifically for the past several decades,
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:05.080]   three or four decades, so little on privacy,
[00:21:05.080 --> 00:21:06.720]   so little on security.
[00:21:06.720 --> 00:21:10.000]   And now, and while things are better
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:11.840]   and there's more attention to those things
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:14.160]   in the last, say, five years,
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:17.280]   there's still a lot of things out there
[00:21:17.280 --> 00:21:21.960]   that are not, you know, up to snuff.
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:23.440]   And we're paying the price for it.
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:26.240]   We have a huge technical debt to pay
[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:28.720]   in cybersecurity and privacy.
[00:21:28.720 --> 00:21:31.040]   And it's gonna take, you know,
[00:21:31.040 --> 00:21:33.880]   it's gonna take decades to get it right
[00:21:33.880 --> 00:21:36.360]   because it's taken that long to, you know,
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:40.080]   build all of these things so that those are not
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:45.000]   a natural part of, an intrinsic part of the world
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:46.960]   that we've built with technology.
[00:21:46.960 --> 00:21:49.840]   - It's funny, Ed and I, and I guess you too, Jason
[00:21:49.840 --> 00:21:52.680]   and Renee, I've been covering this for so long.
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:54.840]   And when I first started covering tech,
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:58.400]   it was just a narrow slice of the economy,
[00:21:58.400 --> 00:22:00.200]   it was a narrow slice of the world.
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:02.920]   And these decisions didn't carry much weight
[00:22:02.920 --> 00:22:05.520]   all of a sudden because it's so important,
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:08.440]   these decisions carry huge weight.
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:10.360]   And it's hard to know what's right.
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:11.720]   - And they were different companies, right?
[00:22:11.720 --> 00:22:12.960]   They were Oracle, they weren't Amazon,
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:14.200]   they weren't the company you bought from
[00:22:14.200 --> 00:22:15.160]   that was making these systems.
[00:22:15.160 --> 00:22:16.760]   It was companies you maybe had a parent
[00:22:16.760 --> 00:22:17.920]   or uncle who worked for.
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:19.160]   - Right.
[00:22:19.160 --> 00:22:22.400]   - Well, and there's another thing too,
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:25.680]   to add, I agree completely with what Jason said
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:29.200]   and I will add that right now,
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:34.200]   most of the technical and ethical decisions
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:38.880]   are being made by engineers in Silicon Valley,
[00:22:38.880 --> 00:22:42.040]   even though there's a huge political component to them.
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:44.800]   And at least in the Western world,
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:48.560]   the two largest powers,
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:51.600]   the United States and the United Kingdom
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:56.600]   are basically so consumed with self-destructive,
[00:22:56.600 --> 00:22:59.920]   internal problems that nobody,
[00:22:59.920 --> 00:23:04.480]   nobody is offering the slightest bit of leadership
[00:23:04.480 --> 00:23:05.760]   on these issues.
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:12.200]   Probably the one force in the Western economies
[00:23:12.200 --> 00:23:15.040]   that's offering anything there is Germany.
[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:17.440]   And the reason that Germany is doing that
[00:23:17.440 --> 00:23:20.720]   is because of the unfortunate history that they have
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:25.920]   from both from the Nazi times,
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:29.920]   but also more recently from East Germany,
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:34.920]   where they've baked privacy into their constitution,
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:39.640]   into their government and into their culture.
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:44.240]   And even there, there's a struggle
[00:23:44.240 --> 00:23:48.480]   to still come to terms with a lot of the technical decisions
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:49.320]   that are happening there.
[00:23:49.320 --> 00:23:54.120]   So when you have this huge interlocking problem
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:56.840]   of technology and politics,
[00:23:56.840 --> 00:23:59.080]   and yet the political leadership
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:01.520]   is almost completely lacking on this,
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:06.280]   and that fundamentally is the problem, I think.
[00:24:06.280 --> 00:24:07.120]   - It's true as well.
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:09.280]   - You do have to admire, sorry Rene,
[00:24:09.280 --> 00:24:10.520]   I just wanted a quick thing.
[00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:14.880]   You do have to admire Tim Cook and his remarks,
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:16.480]   where we started this conversation.
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:21.040]   It is self-serving, Apple has played its hand
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:25.560]   where it's not being Amazon or Facebook or Google
[00:24:25.560 --> 00:24:27.360]   and making all of this money off of data,
[00:24:27.360 --> 00:24:29.000]   which is a goldmine.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:33.200]   And ultimately, all of those companies will eclipse Apple
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:38.120]   in monetarily and in market share and those things.
[00:24:38.120 --> 00:24:40.920]   Because of that, the writing knows it's on the wall,
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:44.120]   but where Apple has put its,
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:47.400]   it's stake in the ground, is on privacy.
[00:24:47.400 --> 00:24:49.680]   It doesn't have the data operations
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:51.000]   that the other companies have,
[00:24:51.000 --> 00:24:55.360]   and it's put its stake in the ground with its products there.
[00:24:55.360 --> 00:24:58.160]   So it is self-serving, but still you have to admire
[00:24:58.160 --> 00:25:00.440]   Tim Cook for showing some leadership
[00:25:00.440 --> 00:25:02.080]   because we have to, at its point,
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:04.640]   a huge vacuum in leadership on these things,
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:06.080]   and we need it in the public world
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:08.320]   as well as the private world.
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:11.280]   - Well, here's a site you might enjoy.
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:13.240]   I don't know, I'm gonna have to say an adult word
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:15.680]   to say this site's URL.
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:19.560]   We can bloop it off Google.de.
[00:25:19.560 --> 00:25:21.720]   Don't let Google take over Berlin.
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:24.560]   Google plans to implant a Google campus in Kreitzburg,
[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:27.280]   Berlin, we, as a decentralized network of people
[00:25:27.280 --> 00:25:30.200]   want to keep our lives and space is free
[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:33.080]   from this law and tax evading company
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:35.760]   that's building a dystopian future.
[00:25:35.760 --> 00:25:37.080]   - This campaign succeeded.
[00:25:37.080 --> 00:25:37.920]   - More on our wiki.
[00:25:37.920 --> 00:25:40.360]   - This campaign succeeded.
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:44.000]   Google has decided not to open that.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.920]   - It's super interesting to me
[00:25:45.920 --> 00:25:47.800]   because we can't all afford everything.
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:49.520]   We want a lot of things, but we can't all afford them,
[00:25:49.520 --> 00:25:50.880]   but we're all data billionaires.
[00:25:50.880 --> 00:25:52.360]   We're all equally data rich.
[00:25:52.360 --> 00:25:53.440]   It's the great equalizer,
[00:25:53.440 --> 00:25:56.080]   and we can get all these data subsidized products,
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:25:57.600]   but we have different expectations.
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:00.000]   Like we know, we can, we give Google our selfies,
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.120]   and it gives us amazing Google photos,
[00:26:02.120 --> 00:26:03.360]   but we probably don't think about them
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:05.040]   using that for military drone strikes.
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:07.120]   And when we hear that, it's not the deal
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:09.280]   we feel like we signed up for.
[00:26:09.280 --> 00:26:11.320]   Our expectations get suddenly out of whack,
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:13.520]   or we hear with Amazon and law enforcement.
[00:26:13.520 --> 00:26:15.920]   And it's gonna, I think, have to result
[00:26:15.920 --> 00:26:18.040]   in a lot more disclosure and a lot more
[00:26:18.040 --> 00:26:19.560]   sort of sobering of our community,
[00:26:19.560 --> 00:26:21.240]   'cause it really is no free.
[00:26:21.240 --> 00:26:23.320]   We're just, we are giving them our selfies,
[00:26:23.320 --> 00:26:25.760]   and they're gonna monetize that some way.
[00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:31.400]   - To paraphrase, or actually not, to quote Charles Dickens,
[00:26:31.400 --> 00:26:33.040]   it's the best of times.
[00:26:33.040 --> 00:26:34.280]   It's the worst of times.
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:35.120]   - It really, really is.
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:36.840]   - It's a really interesting mix,
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:38.320]   and it's a very challenging one.
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:39.600]   We're gonna talk, we're gonna take a break,
[00:26:39.600 --> 00:26:43.880]   talk about the biggest software acquisition in history,
[00:26:43.880 --> 00:26:47.160]   which just broke hours ago, and it's kind of a stutter,
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.120]   and you guys are gonna have to explain to me
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:50.040]   what's going on here.
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:53.440]   But first a word from word press.
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:56.440]   If you don't have a website, you ought to make one.
[00:26:56.440 --> 00:26:59.760]   I think it's increasingly obvious that merely existing
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:02.560]   on social media, having a Facebook page or a Twitter feed
[00:27:02.560 --> 00:27:03.880]   is not enough.
[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:06.840]   If you're a, even if you're a teenager in high school,
[00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:10.200]   you ought to create a website because that's what people
[00:27:10.200 --> 00:27:11.560]   will find when they search your name,
[00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:12.960]   and you wanna control that.
[00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:14.760]   It's even more important if you're in business,
[00:27:14.760 --> 00:27:17.280]   and the easiest, best way, most affordable way
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:20.760]   to create a great website is with wordpress.com.
[00:27:20.760 --> 00:27:23.080]   I just got a little notice in my WordPress app
[00:27:23.080 --> 00:27:25.160]   that I am celebrating my 12th anniversary
[00:27:25.160 --> 00:27:27.160]   with wordpress.com.
[00:27:27.160 --> 00:27:28.880]   It wasn't the beginning of my blog.
[00:27:28.880 --> 00:27:31.400]   I started with content management systems
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.120]   going back, I think, to 2001.
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:34.600]   All sorts of different ones.
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:37.160]   But I finally settled on the best wordpress.
[00:27:37.160 --> 00:27:41.720]   I'm not alone, 31%, 31% of all websites in the world
[00:27:41.720 --> 00:27:45.080]   now run on word 32.
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:46.480]   Just went up.
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:50.000]   It's like the tote board at the telethon.
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.200]   It's now 32% of the internet.
[00:27:52.200 --> 00:27:55.120]   We're gonna get to 30 the internet by hook or by crook.
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:56.400]   Pretty impressive, right?
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:59.120]   Matt Mullenweg, the guy who created WordPress,
[00:27:59.120 --> 00:28:01.520]   just had a vision.
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:04.000]   He wanted to make it easy for you to make a website,
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.360]   and that vision has come to life at wordpress.com.
[00:28:07.360 --> 00:28:09.400]   It's so your vision can come to life.
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:11.360]   There are no limits at wordpress.com.
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:13.120]   You can create the ultimate online hub
[00:28:13.120 --> 00:28:17.080]   that's yours, your ethos, your style, and you own it.
[00:28:17.080 --> 00:28:21.840]   You can upload video, images, audio, all your text.
[00:28:21.840 --> 00:28:22.920]   It's on your site.
[00:28:22.920 --> 00:28:24.720]   You can get it in, you can get it out.
[00:28:24.720 --> 00:28:25.560]   It's yours.
[00:28:25.560 --> 00:28:27.760]   It's not sitting anywhere else.
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:29.520]   You could choose from hundreds of designs,
[00:28:29.520 --> 00:28:31.360]   so it'll look exactly how you want
[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:33.600]   with the best engineering built in.
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:35.680]   And WordPress is hassle-free.
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:37.040]   It takes care of the hosting, the security,
[00:28:37.040 --> 00:28:37.880]   the software updates.
[00:28:37.880 --> 00:28:40.040]   You can focus on your site.
[00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:42.840]   And now I had, I have to say,
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:45.880]   when I started using Twitter and Facebook and Instagram,
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:49.000]   I stopped posting in my blog, and that was a mistake.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:50.640]   And now I'm back and posting,
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:53.360]   because that's where I live on the internet.
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:55.280]   That's where you live on the internet.
[00:28:55.280 --> 00:28:57.160]   Grow your audience, reach new customers,
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:59.560]   built-in search engine optimization,
[00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:01.960]   social media sharing so you can get other people
[00:29:01.960 --> 00:29:04.560]   to talk about your site on their Facebook and Twitter.
[00:29:04.560 --> 00:29:06.080]   Don't get rid of your Facebook and Twitter,
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:07.640]   but you gotta have something to look back to,
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:09.560]   and that's your WordPress site.
[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:12.680]   And I love the WordPress app on iOS and Android.
[00:29:12.680 --> 00:29:15.440]   When we were traveling, that was how I posted blog posts,
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:17.760]   checked comments, approved comments,
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:22.200]   looked at my analytics, my stats, great app.
[00:29:22.200 --> 00:29:23.800]   Launch your website with confidence knowing
[00:29:23.800 --> 00:29:26.240]   you can always get help 24/7
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:30.040]   from a support team that's friendly, nice, and smart.
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:32.920]   Plan started just $4 a month, find out why 32%
[00:29:32.920 --> 00:29:35.840]   of every website in the world runs on WordPress,
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:38.320]   including some of the biggest publishers in the world.
[00:29:38.320 --> 00:29:42.240]   We've got to deal 2, 15% off any new plan purchase,
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:45.120]   but you have to go to WordPress.com/twit.
[00:29:45.120 --> 00:29:48.000]   WordPress.com/twit.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.680]   Create your new website.
[00:29:49.680 --> 00:29:52.640]   Create your, put your flag, put down your flag,
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:57.640]   plant your flag on the internet, WordPress.com/twit.
[00:29:57.640 --> 00:29:58.920]   Thank you so much.
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:00.920]   Thank you, Matt, and WordPress and automatic,
[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:03.180]   and all the team there for 12 years,
[00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:07.600]   I've been happy at WordPress.com/twit.
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:09.240]   - So glad you're blocking again, Leo.
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:12.160]   - It's so much fun, and I actually,
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:13.600]   'cause I don't do Instagram, so instead of putting
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:15.240]   a thing on Instagram, I put it there.
[00:30:15.240 --> 00:30:17.240]   And the nice thing about that is,
[00:30:17.240 --> 00:30:18.560]   if you wanna see my pictures,
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:20.680]   you know where to go, leoeloport.com.
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:21.760]   'Cause if you put 'em on Instagram,
[00:30:21.760 --> 00:30:23.560]   sometimes you see 'em, sometimes you don't.
[00:30:23.560 --> 00:30:24.640]   - And it's yours, you own it.
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:25.480]   - I own it.
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:27.240]   - I get those, you know, I have to say,
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:30.240]   if you go back in my blog, because I've moved around,
[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:31.800]   there are big holes in it.
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:34.640]   There's all the text survived important export,
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:36.360]   but a lot of the images were stored.
[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:40.080]   Remember Vox, I had stuff stored on typepress, Vox.
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:43.560]   - I remember when you were complaining about this,
[00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:46.920]   you know, last time I was on, well, yeah, that,
[00:30:46.920 --> 00:30:51.720]   but also the fact that you had to go to secure HTTP.
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:53.800]   - Oh, yeah, that was easy on WordPress.
[00:30:53.800 --> 00:30:55.160]   It's just a checkbox.
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:30:56.920]   - Right, it's just a checkbox.
[00:30:56.920 --> 00:31:00.560]   But I think, but yeah, you know, to the point,
[00:31:00.560 --> 00:31:05.560]   I deleted, I had a blog, you know,
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:10.560]   that from 2000 to probably 2012, 2013 or so,
[00:31:10.560 --> 00:31:18.320]   I finally just deleted everything.
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:19.920]   There was so much there. - Really?
[00:31:19.920 --> 00:31:23.000]   - That was just, you know, there's,
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:26.960]   5% of it was stuff that I really wish I still had.
[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:29.120]   Actually, I do have it in the backup somewhere,
[00:31:29.120 --> 00:31:32.400]   but I wish I still had, but the other 95% of it was,
[00:31:32.400 --> 00:31:35.400]   you know, it was about software and products
[00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:40.400]   and a lot of hands on stuff that is simply about dead products.
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:43.840]   And it just, - I wouldn't delete anything.
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:45.240]   I mean, there's, first of all,
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:47.600]   there's plenty of room on the internet, Ed.
[00:31:47.600 --> 00:31:48.720]   (laughing)
[00:31:48.720 --> 00:31:50.840]   - We're not running out yet.
[00:31:50.840 --> 00:31:53.680]   I'm just looking, this is my first WordPress post
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:57.680]   is 28 February 2001. - Yeah.
[00:31:57.680 --> 00:31:58.600]   - And it's so fun.
[00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:00.400]   I mean, some of you're right, some of it's nuts.
[00:32:00.400 --> 00:32:03.040]   Like, hey, this meeting is ending.
[00:32:03.040 --> 00:32:04.200]   Yay, lunch.
[00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:06.960]   This is pre-Twitter, folks.
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:08.440]   But then there's also, you know,
[00:32:08.440 --> 00:32:11.160]   I think things that are, to me of interest,
[00:32:11.160 --> 00:32:12.680]   maybe not anybody else,
[00:32:12.680 --> 00:32:15.160]   but it's kind of like keeping a journal, right?
[00:32:15.160 --> 00:32:16.040]   - Right.
[00:32:16.040 --> 00:32:18.600]   - And then your old stuff's there.
[00:32:18.600 --> 00:32:19.560]   I just like having it.
[00:32:19.560 --> 00:32:22.600]   I wish some of the pictures I'd posted were still there.
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:26.640]   Do you remember, remember Mo blogging?
[00:32:26.640 --> 00:32:28.120]   Remember that?
[00:32:28.120 --> 00:32:31.760]   There was textamerica.com, remember that?
[00:32:31.760 --> 00:32:33.640]   So this was early days of camera phones,
[00:32:33.640 --> 00:32:36.680]   maybe 2002 or three.
[00:32:36.680 --> 00:32:40.120]   And I posted hundreds of pictures pre-Instagram,
[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:42.400]   way way, on a site called Text America.
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:44.120]   And it just disappeared.
[00:32:44.120 --> 00:32:45.800]   It was called Mo blogging.
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:48.440]   Am I the, am I dreaming this?
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:50.520]   - You remember that? - No, we're Mo blogging.
[00:32:50.520 --> 00:32:52.400]   (both laughing)
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:54.640]   - You can still see Jai-Ko.
[00:32:54.640 --> 00:32:57.520]   Jai-Ko, I miss Jai-Ko, I love Jai-Ko.
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:33:00.400]   - Yeah, no, all the text America stuff disappeared.
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:01.680]   It's all gone.
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:03.120]   - All the pound stuff has gone.
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:03.960]   So much stuff.
[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:04.960]   - I wish some of these pictures.
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:07.760]   - I think a lot of the problem of it back then,
[00:33:07.760 --> 00:33:11.800]   and a lot of the appeal of the networks
[00:33:11.800 --> 00:33:15.560]   that we have available to us today are that,
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:17.160]   you know, it started with Blogger,
[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:19.080]   where it was just like, you know, just go sign up
[00:33:19.080 --> 00:33:21.400]   and they'll take care of all the backend stuff.
[00:33:21.400 --> 00:33:23.880]   But, you know, I remember for a decade or so,
[00:33:23.880 --> 00:33:27.520]   I was, you know, a webmaster and an IT guy.
[00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:29.760]   And I had to, you know, I had to learn
[00:33:29.760 --> 00:33:34.760]   how to kick a server that was 2000 miles away, right?
[00:33:34.760 --> 00:33:37.520]   And, you know, that was valuable IT stuff to learn.
[00:33:37.520 --> 00:33:39.360]   But there just comes-- - You know, now.
[00:33:39.360 --> 00:33:41.440]   - It's exhausting. - It is exhausting.
[00:33:41.440 --> 00:33:43.800]   Well, for a long time, this was self-hosted WordPress,
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:46.320]   and that killed productivity.
[00:33:46.320 --> 00:33:47.320]   (laughing)
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:48.640]   Just kill me.
[00:33:48.640 --> 00:33:51.280]   This is, here's one from 2001.
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:53.640]   Tomorrow morning on Tech TV,
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:55.080]   we're doing a round table celebrating
[00:33:55.080 --> 00:33:57.200]   the 10th anniversary of Linux.
[00:33:57.200 --> 00:34:03.880]   So, here we are, a little bit later, 17 years later,
[00:34:03.880 --> 00:34:08.360]   and I am blown away by this headline.
[00:34:08.360 --> 00:34:09.200]   - Yeah.
[00:34:09.200 --> 00:34:11.840]   - Red Hat has been acquired by IBM.
[00:34:11.840 --> 00:34:13.760]   By the way, Red Hat was one of the early Linuxes
[00:34:13.760 --> 00:34:16.120]   I used, I used Mandrake and then Red Hat.
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:21.120]   For $34 billion, making it,
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:25.400]   it's the biggest acquisition IBM's ever made.
[00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:29.080]   It's the third biggest tech acquisition of all time.
[00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:29.920]   - Yeah, after-- - Bigger even
[00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:31.520]   than Microsoft buying LinkedIn.
[00:34:31.520 --> 00:34:35.920]   Is Red Hat worth 34 billion?
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:37.560]   - At least it's not based on user count Leo.
[00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:39.560]   That's one of the things I'm grateful for.
[00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:40.760]   - It's kind of stunning.
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:43.680]   I mean, the only bigger ones are Dell buying EMC.
[00:34:43.680 --> 00:34:45.280]   That was the last year.
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:49.880]   And I, semi-conductor of Vago technologies,
[00:34:49.880 --> 00:34:55.000]   buys and renames itself Broadcom and $37 billion.
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:59.080]   - Well AOL Time Warner, if you count that, right?
[00:34:59.080 --> 00:34:59.920]   - How much was that?
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:01.240]   - You sort of put that aside.
[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:04.080]   - That was 165 billion.
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:06.320]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:08.400]   241 billion adjusted for inflation.
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:10.480]   So that's a lot bigger.
[00:35:10.480 --> 00:35:12.600]   That was the number two acquisition of all time.
[00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:14.760]   That was misguided, right?
[00:35:14.760 --> 00:35:18.280]   - Yeah, so in the press release,
[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:19.680]   I read the press release today.
[00:35:19.680 --> 00:35:22.480]   And like you, I'm still trying to figure it out.
[00:35:22.480 --> 00:35:24.480]   And there's folks at ZVNet
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:28.640]   who probably have already posted something on this
[00:35:28.640 --> 00:35:29.680]   and I need to go read it.
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:32.040]   Stephen J. Von Nichols, I would expect,
[00:35:32.040 --> 00:35:36.800]   would be if he doesn't have a post up there yet,
[00:35:36.800 --> 00:35:38.520]   he will soon.
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:40.080]   But one of the things that they said
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:43.920]   in their press release was hybrid cloud.
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:46.280]   I think hybrid cloud, hybrid cloud, hybrid cloud,
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:49.720]   that's their approach to it.
[00:35:49.720 --> 00:35:54.720]   And Red Hat has been an enterprise services company
[00:35:54.720 --> 00:35:57.200]   for quite a while.
[00:35:57.200 --> 00:35:59.600]   - They're not a Linux distro.
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:02.320]   They have 12,000 employees, I think.
[00:36:02.320 --> 00:36:03.160]   - Whoa.
[00:36:03.160 --> 00:36:09.680]   - However, they were valued at the last, I saw 20 billion.
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:11.760]   So this is a significant premium.
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:12.600]   (laughs)
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:14.600]   - But do we just announce that we'll sell Fedora?
[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:15.760]   - That's how our ads were.
[00:36:15.760 --> 00:36:17.280]   - We'll sell the Twift Fedora instance
[00:36:17.280 --> 00:36:19.320]   for like 34 million, if anyone's interested.
[00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:20.520]   - Wow.
[00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:21.360]   - Just put that out there.
[00:36:21.360 --> 00:36:22.520]   - I'll take it, yeah.
[00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:28.200]   Red Hat missed its most recent revenue estimates.
[00:36:28.200 --> 00:36:29.600]   Companies subscription revenue,
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:34.400]   20% of year over year growth to $722 million.
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:35.800]   So that's a lot of money for a free audience.
[00:36:35.800 --> 00:36:37.280]   - But they think they need this to compete, right?
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:39.400]   They think that the cloud is definitely the cloud services
[00:36:39.400 --> 00:36:41.040]   of the future in Amazon and other companies
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:43.720]   are running away with them and IBM's IBM
[00:36:43.720 --> 00:36:45.880]   and they need one of how Ed figured out
[00:36:45.880 --> 00:36:46.720]   how to kick the server.
[00:36:46.720 --> 00:36:49.160]   They thought they think Red Hat's gonna help kick them
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:51.080]   into the, better into the cloud of your own.
[00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:54.320]   - Yeah, this is what Jeannie Rometty, the CEO said.
[00:36:54.320 --> 00:36:56.360]   The acquisition of Red Hat is a game changer.
[00:36:56.360 --> 00:36:58.760]   It changes everything about the cloud market.
[00:36:58.760 --> 00:37:01.240]   IBM will become the world's number one hybrid cloud
[00:37:01.240 --> 00:37:02.480]   provider offering companies.
[00:37:02.480 --> 00:37:04.320]   The only open cloud solution,
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:06.280]   that's cloud four times in one sense.
[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:08.320]   The one launch, the full value of the cloud
[00:37:08.320 --> 00:37:09.280]   for their businesses.
[00:37:09.280 --> 00:37:10.360]   I guess it's all about, right?
[00:37:10.360 --> 00:37:11.520]   - The open is big now too.
[00:37:11.520 --> 00:37:12.840]   - Cloud.
[00:37:12.840 --> 00:37:17.840]   Well, Microsoft, I mean, I thought the moon had turned blue
[00:37:17.840 --> 00:37:21.760]   when Microsoft announced they were gonna put Linux on Azure.
[00:37:21.760 --> 00:37:23.080]   - Yeah. - And they bought GitHub.
[00:37:23.080 --> 00:37:24.240]   - And then they bought GitHub, by the way,
[00:37:24.240 --> 00:37:26.000]   that closed this week also.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:28.080]   It's an interesting week for open source, isn't it?
[00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:30.440]   - AIX must be running quietly in a closet somewhere.
[00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:33.000]   - AIX apples. - Apples, eunuchs.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.640]   - Oh yeah. - Yeah, seriously,
[00:37:34.640 --> 00:37:38.080]   anybody who is still on the, you know,
[00:37:38.080 --> 00:37:41.840]   who is still quoting Steve Ballmer saying that,
[00:37:41.840 --> 00:37:44.480]   you know, open source is communism or, you know,
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:48.800]   whatever, whatever that stupid thing he said way back when was,
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:50.640]   you know, you've met--
[00:37:50.640 --> 00:37:52.520]   - He said Linux was a cancer.
[00:37:52.520 --> 00:37:53.760]   - Linux was a cancer.
[00:37:53.760 --> 00:37:54.600]   That's right.
[00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:57.640]   It was Bill Gates who said that,
[00:37:57.640 --> 00:38:00.040]   that open source is communism.
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:03.480]   But that, that was a long, long time ago
[00:38:03.480 --> 00:38:06.160]   in a galaxy far away.
[00:38:06.160 --> 00:38:10.400]   And, you know, I mean, anyone who's been paying attention,
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:13.560]   it has been at least five years
[00:38:13.560 --> 00:38:18.280]   that Microsoft has been unequivocally committing
[00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:20.640]   to open source projects.
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:25.640]   They just, they just open source their patents
[00:38:25.640 --> 00:38:32.240]   for Android, you know, when you say DNA infusion.
[00:38:33.640 --> 00:38:35.840]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah. - They had been making
[00:38:35.840 --> 00:38:39.920]   a significant amount of money over the years.
[00:38:39.920 --> 00:38:43.280]   I mean, a billion dollars a year from Samsung alone
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:44.880]   on their-- - Google was making that.
[00:38:44.880 --> 00:38:48.360]   - Right. - That licensing for those.
[00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:52.440]   So giving that up was, I mean, you know,
[00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:56.880]   a real demonstration of a commitment to this, you know,
[00:38:56.880 --> 00:38:58.600]   this open source stuff.
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:00.360]   - Yeah, by the way, companies want to keep our prior
[00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:02.320]   to what makes them money and an open source,
[00:39:02.320 --> 00:39:04.200]   everything that makes their competition money.
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:05.920]   That seems like the winning strategy.
[00:39:05.920 --> 00:39:06.760]   - Totally.
[00:39:06.760 --> 00:39:09.600]   It's kind of like, the Microsoft thing is kind of like,
[00:39:09.600 --> 00:39:13.880]   and it is relevant to the IBM Red Hat story.
[00:39:13.880 --> 00:39:16.040]   You know, it's like in the new Star Trek Discovery,
[00:39:16.040 --> 00:39:19.040]   there's the guy who's a Starfleet officer
[00:39:19.040 --> 00:39:21.920]   who's actually a Klingon underneath.
[00:39:21.920 --> 00:39:24.600]   But, you know, so that's kind of like what,
[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:27.560]   it's like a complete DNA infusion.
[00:39:27.560 --> 00:39:30.720]   But today's Microsoft is essentially a Linux company,
[00:39:30.720 --> 00:39:33.840]   especially on the server, because all of this stuff
[00:39:33.840 --> 00:39:36.120]   is the backbone of the internet,
[00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:38.320]   it's the backbone of the enterprise,
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:41.120]   and, you know, these tools and open source technology
[00:39:41.120 --> 00:39:43.680]   and software runs the world.
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:47.800]   And so for IBM, as they said, you hit the nail on the head,
[00:39:47.800 --> 00:39:50.720]   Leo, like they mentioned cloud four times in the one sentence.
[00:39:50.720 --> 00:39:53.120]   This is all about them trying to compete
[00:39:53.120 --> 00:39:57.920]   and get a leg up any way they can against Google,
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:00.400]   Amazon and Microsoft.
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:03.520]   Amazon and Microsoft have really been kind of running away,
[00:40:03.520 --> 00:40:06.040]   especially Amazon with the cloud market.
[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:07.320]   Google's playing catch up,
[00:40:07.320 --> 00:40:11.400]   they've been trying to use price and AI,
[00:40:11.400 --> 00:40:14.320]   machine learning as their way to pick off
[00:40:14.320 --> 00:40:16.480]   some of these cloud deals.
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:18.600]   And they have been somewhat successful,
[00:40:18.600 --> 00:40:22.880]   but still, you know, Amazon's the 800 pound gorilla.
[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:25.400]   Microsoft is the number one challenger.
[00:40:25.400 --> 00:40:28.920]   Google's trying to, you know, elbow its way in.
[00:40:28.920 --> 00:40:32.280]   And IBM has been trying unsuccessfully
[00:40:32.280 --> 00:40:34.840]   to sort of be the fourth wheel there.
[00:40:34.840 --> 00:40:38.080]   And they needed something like this
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:39.680]   to help them push forward.
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:43.680]   And Red Hat is interesting because they've been rumored
[00:40:43.680 --> 00:40:47.080]   to have been an acquisition target of Oracle,
[00:40:47.080 --> 00:40:52.080]   of Microsoft, of Google especially.
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:40:55.520]   And now it's happened with IBM.
[00:40:55.520 --> 00:40:59.160]   And so they are a huge company and they,
[00:40:59.160 --> 00:41:03.840]   to Ed's point earlier, they are very much a cloud services,
[00:41:03.840 --> 00:41:06.520]   IT integrator kind of company anymore,
[00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:08.320]   not really a Linux company.
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:09.920]   Okay. No, no.
[00:41:09.920 --> 00:41:14.240]   And so it's not a Linux distribution, you know, anymore.
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:15.160]   It really is.
[00:41:15.160 --> 00:41:18.560]   It's funny because even during the dot com boom,
[00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:20.960]   the moment that the dot com boom that we kind of all,
[00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:23.840]   or I think a lot of us scratch our heads was the moment.
[00:41:23.840 --> 00:41:25.840]   And I thought about this when the story broke.
[00:41:25.840 --> 00:41:30.840]   The moment that Red Hat actually was worth more than IBM
[00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:33.640]   in value, its market capitalization,
[00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:34.920]   was the moment we all kind of went,
[00:41:34.920 --> 00:41:38.560]   "Yeah, this is probably getting a little bit out of control."
[00:41:38.560 --> 00:41:41.920]   And that wasn't long afterwards that the dot com bust happened.
[00:41:41.920 --> 00:41:43.720]   So it is somewhat ironic, you know,
[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:47.160]   that was one of the pivotal moments of the dot com boom.
[00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:50.080]   It is funny that these two companies are now paired up,
[00:41:50.080 --> 00:41:52.760]   you know, 20 years later almost
[00:41:52.760 --> 00:41:57.400]   and tried to make a go at Amazon and Google and Microsoft
[00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:00.880]   as the big companies that are going to control
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:04.680]   the next generation of the internet and the enterprise
[00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:07.280]   unless IBM can disrupt them.
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:10.560]   And IBM, you know, they have the got their work cut out for them,
[00:42:10.560 --> 00:42:11.720]   even with this acquisition.
[00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:14.360]   Although Red Hat gets them back in the door for a lot of other services,
[00:42:14.360 --> 00:42:17.360]   I think that's what they think at least.
[00:42:17.360 --> 00:42:18.760]   Yeah.
[00:42:18.760 --> 00:42:22.720]   Although I have to say, and this is really unfair
[00:42:22.720 --> 00:42:27.120]   and I don't mean this to be as cruel
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:29.280]   as it's probably going to sound,
[00:42:29.280 --> 00:42:34.760]   but it does in some ways remind me of the merger of Kmart and Sears.
[00:42:34.760 --> 00:42:36.040]   Oh, dude.
[00:42:36.040 --> 00:42:37.520]   Holy cow.
[00:42:37.520 --> 00:42:39.760]   Well, that went down.
[00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:44.280]   I know, that's really harsh and all.
[00:42:44.280 --> 00:42:46.760]   But both of those companies,
[00:42:47.760 --> 00:42:54.440]   you know, when they merged, they had been successful for years
[00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:56.520]   in their field.
[00:42:56.520 --> 00:43:02.000]   They had struggled as other companies leapfrog them
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:08.720]   and they dropped in the rankings in their segment.
[00:43:08.720 --> 00:43:13.480]   And, you know, Jason, like you say, you've got AWS
[00:43:13.480 --> 00:43:16.120]   and then you have Azure and then you have a big,
[00:43:16.120 --> 00:43:20.920]   long gap before you get to Google and IBM
[00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:25.600]   and Salesforce or anybody else who's going to be in there
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:27.320]   with a cloud product.
[00:43:27.320 --> 00:43:29.440]   And I just wondered, you know,
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:35.200]   there's always a temptation for two smaller companies
[00:43:35.200 --> 00:43:38.960]   to combine and say, we're going to, you know,
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:43.680]   by combining, we'll be big enough to be a credible competitor.
[00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:48.120]   But if it's not a good fit,
[00:43:48.120 --> 00:43:51.760]   if it's not a good fit culturally, technologically,
[00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:56.680]   product-wise, then what you do is you magnify your problems
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:44:01.760]   instead of magnifying your opportunities.
[00:44:01.760 --> 00:44:06.080]   Boy, the analogy that came out in Sears is pretty stunning.
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:08.560]   That was an 11-billion-dollar merger,
[00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:13.360]   two failing retailers who were desperately trying to stay
[00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:17.280]   current in a, this was back in 2004.
[00:44:17.280 --> 00:44:19.280]   Yeah, the one way this one looks better, though,
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:23.360]   is that they were in a market where retail was drastically dropping.
[00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:25.640]   In this case, you know, 10% of the world,
[00:44:25.640 --> 00:44:29.920]   10% of enterprises today are all cloud by 2025.
[00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:31.760]   That's likely to be 80%.
[00:44:31.760 --> 00:44:34.120]   And so even these two together,
[00:44:34.120 --> 00:44:36.280]   if they can find a niche where it's like,
[00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:38.480]   we're really good at hybrid cloud
[00:44:38.480 --> 00:44:40.640]   or we're really good at hospitals,
[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:43.360]   but they can find one segment of the cloud market
[00:44:43.360 --> 00:44:45.440]   that they can serve better than anybody else
[00:44:45.440 --> 00:44:50.280]   in a market that's growing this big over the next decade.
[00:44:50.280 --> 00:44:52.440]   They could survive and even thrive
[00:44:52.440 --> 00:44:54.840]   if they can do that and do it well.
[00:44:54.840 --> 00:44:58.640]   It does seem like a kind of a premium.
[00:44:58.640 --> 00:45:03.640]   I mean, it's a considerable amount over its Friday closing price.
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:08.200]   I wonder, will we say, did IBM overpaid for this?
[00:45:08.200 --> 00:45:10.360]   Or was there a bidding war going on?
[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:12.120]   Was there something going on behind the scenes?
[00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:15.680]   Was they just grasp it from,
[00:45:15.680 --> 00:45:17.720]   usually when the price is that high,
[00:45:17.720 --> 00:45:21.480]   there's somebody else like Google trying to come in and take it.
[00:45:21.480 --> 00:45:23.040]   Google's long been rumored.
[00:45:23.040 --> 00:45:28.280]   Yeah, as, you know, and you got those two, yeah, or Microsoft,
[00:45:28.280 --> 00:45:29.920]   Microsoft doesn't really need them.
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:32.440]   I don't think they want to spend that kind of money right now.
[00:45:32.440 --> 00:45:33.640]   I think that would be.
[00:45:33.640 --> 00:45:34.760]   Yeah, they don't have to.
[00:45:34.760 --> 00:45:37.160]   They've gotten so good and they've hired so many
[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:39.600]   of the top minds in Linux that it's one of those things
[00:45:39.600 --> 00:45:42.040]   like it's a lot cheaper to just go and hire, you know,
[00:45:42.040 --> 00:45:45.120]   for them to hire 5,000 really great, you know,
[00:45:45.120 --> 00:45:49.160]   Linux or just open source and cloud experts.
[00:45:49.160 --> 00:45:52.760]   If you bought Ray Hat's stock on Friday at $116
[00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:56.920]   and it's now worth $190 on Sunday, you're very happy.
[00:45:56.920 --> 00:45:58.160]   Yeah, you did all right.
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:45:58.920]   You did all right.
[00:45:58.920 --> 00:46:00.240]   Holy cow.
[00:46:00.240 --> 00:46:02.560]   You might have, yeah, you might have the SEC
[00:46:02.560 --> 00:46:03.720]   knocking on your door.
[00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:04.720]   Yeah.
[00:46:06.200 --> 00:46:08.680]   The truth is, it's a tweet on the Cayman Islands internet now,
[00:46:08.680 --> 00:46:09.240]   anyway, so.
[00:46:09.240 --> 00:46:10.640]   Wow.
[00:46:10.640 --> 00:46:12.320]   Just a kind of a stunning move.
[00:46:12.320 --> 00:46:18.760]   And I think, well, only as they say, only time will tell.
[00:46:18.760 --> 00:46:20.000]   I think they'll do OK.
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:22.360]   I think that the cloud market is growing so big
[00:46:22.360 --> 00:46:26.400]   and there's so much headroom and so much that's happening.
[00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:29.840]   They don't even have to have a massive part of that market.
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:33.640]   If they can find 5% to 10% of it and serve it really well,
[00:46:33.640 --> 00:46:35.000]   they'll do fine.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:37.800]   Do you think Linus Torvalds is going to get a little check?
[00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:41.440]   No.
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:43.480]   I don't think he's going to be looking at this guy.
[00:46:43.480 --> 00:46:44.480]   Maybe.
[00:46:44.480 --> 00:46:45.320]   Maybe.
[00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:47.560]   Unless he invested in Red Hat early on.
[00:46:47.560 --> 00:46:49.600]   Well, he might have some Red Hat stock, actually.
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:50.880]   I wouldn't be surprised, right?
[00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:51.480]   He might.
[00:46:51.480 --> 00:46:52.480]   It's possible.
[00:46:52.480 --> 00:46:53.120]   Yeah.
[00:46:53.120 --> 00:46:54.400]   I mean, I'm sure Linus isn't hurting.
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:57.480]   Linus, of course, the creator of Linux as a graduate student,
[00:46:57.480 --> 00:47:02.560]   kept the trademark but didn't keep people
[00:47:02.560 --> 00:47:08.680]   from creating related software or their own versions of Linux.
[00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:10.200]   Now, but you said Red Hat is--
[00:47:10.200 --> 00:47:12.920]   I mean, see, I know Red Hat from way back when
[00:47:12.920 --> 00:47:14.800]   when it was Red Hat Linux.
[00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:19.680]   It was much more than that that they acquired, right?
[00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:20.180]   Yeah.
[00:47:20.180 --> 00:47:23.120]   It's a cloud and open source juggernaut now.
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:24.120]   Yeah.
[00:47:24.120 --> 00:47:26.200]   By the way, Linus took a month off
[00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:29.960]   because to deal with anger issues last month,
[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:31.760]   he's back now.
[00:47:31.760 --> 00:47:33.760]   Maybe he knew when he was angry about that.
[00:47:33.760 --> 00:47:36.080]   I don't know.
[00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:40.680]   A kinder-gentler Linus Torvalds coming back to--
[00:47:40.680 --> 00:47:47.800]   30, 36 days to sort out his role.
[00:47:47.800 --> 00:47:50.560]   And what he was saying, it wasn't just anger issues.
[00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:55.720]   It was the tone that he was setting in the management
[00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:58.000]   of probably the single most important open source
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:00.640]   project in the world.
[00:48:00.640 --> 00:48:07.200]   And he was a frankly cruel and dismissive character
[00:48:07.200 --> 00:48:09.400]   to a lot of people.
[00:48:09.400 --> 00:48:12.560]   And people pointed that out.
[00:48:12.560 --> 00:48:15.800]   The whole Linux project did a whole new code of conduct.
[00:48:15.800 --> 00:48:21.840]   And he went away for 36 days and then came back saying,
[00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:25.560]   I've learned things.
[00:48:25.560 --> 00:48:27.360]   I like Linus a lot.
[00:48:27.360 --> 00:48:28.640]   But he's never yelled at me.
[00:48:28.640 --> 00:48:30.040]   So I don't--
[00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:32.720]   I never tried to commit any code to the--
[00:48:32.720 --> 00:48:35.520]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:48:35.520 --> 00:48:38.920]   Now, there was an article that said that in 1999,
[00:48:38.920 --> 00:48:43.280]   Red Hat Linux presented Torvalds with stock options
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:45.160]   and gratitude for the work he did.
[00:48:45.160 --> 00:48:46.720]   So maybe he had a big day today.
[00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:47.160]   That would be--
[00:48:47.160 --> 00:48:52.880]   He might have if he stuck with those stop options
[00:48:52.880 --> 00:48:54.160]   and hasn't already sold them.
[00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:56.000]   I guess as he probably still has some,
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:59.240]   I would be surprised if he didn't still have some of those.
[00:48:59.240 --> 00:48:59.740]   Good.
[00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:00.720]   I hope that's pretty awesome.
[00:49:00.720 --> 00:49:03.360]   I'd love to see he hit some money going forward.
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:04.920]   You have to--
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:08.600]   I think the great thing about his story and ultimately,
[00:49:08.600 --> 00:49:13.640]   Red Hat, for better or worse, has been known as the flagship
[00:49:13.640 --> 00:49:16.680]   Linux company, even though that we said they've grown
[00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:21.200]   and are far larger than just Linux itself.
[00:49:21.200 --> 00:49:23.960]   You still have to think that in one sense,
[00:49:23.960 --> 00:49:27.520]   this is sort of a victory for a very public kind of victory
[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:30.560]   for open source and its journey.
[00:49:30.560 --> 00:49:35.960]   And to Torvalds, he started this as a college student
[00:49:35.960 --> 00:49:39.520]   and welcomed others to build on his work.
[00:49:39.520 --> 00:49:41.000]   And he did.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:41.880]   He changed the world.
[00:49:41.880 --> 00:49:46.240]   He did something amazing that has made the technology world
[00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:48.880]   a better, more open place.
[00:49:48.880 --> 00:49:51.880]   And so you kind of have to tip your hat to him for it.
[00:49:51.880 --> 00:49:55.040]   His timing was singular, too, because he did this in '91
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:49:56.840]   when the internet was starting to emerge
[00:49:56.840 --> 00:50:04.240]   and the idea of collaborative global coding was brand new.
[00:50:04.240 --> 00:50:06.200]   But boy, it couldn't have been a better time.
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:09.520]   And of course, I got to point out one more thing, which
[00:50:09.520 --> 00:50:12.080]   is that Linus wrote Git.
[00:50:12.080 --> 00:50:14.680]   So now that Microsoft owns GitHub,
[00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:16.920]   for God knows how many billions of dollars,
[00:50:16.920 --> 00:50:18.960]   I swear to God, this guy--
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:20.640]   we talk about Elon Musk a lot.
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:21.560]   Maybe Linus Torvalds.
[00:50:21.560 --> 00:50:22.360]   He changed the world.
[00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:23.520]   Yeah, literally changed the world.
[00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:25.280]   I'll get a little more credit.
[00:50:25.280 --> 00:50:26.760]   Yeah.
[00:50:26.760 --> 00:50:28.360]   Yeah.
[00:50:28.360 --> 00:50:30.880]   And obviously, with his recent problems, at least,
[00:50:30.880 --> 00:50:32.600]   he's trying to do the right thing, right?
[00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:33.600]   Yeah.
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:36.040]   He's-- so--
[00:50:36.040 --> 00:50:40.080]   and there's been lots of people, lots of imperfect people
[00:50:40.080 --> 00:50:42.280]   that have done amazing things.
[00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:46.680]   And it will be the case for the rest of our life
[00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:48.080]   on this planet.
[00:50:48.080 --> 00:50:50.760]   We live in interesting times.
[00:50:50.760 --> 00:50:51.480]   Let's take a break.
[00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:52.000]   Come back.
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:53.240]   There's lots more to talk about.
[00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:54.280]   The bot is here.
[00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:55.120]   It's great to have you.
[00:50:55.120 --> 00:50:57.040]   Ed, the Ed Bot report is on ZD.
[00:50:57.040 --> 00:50:58.640]   Ed, he's at Ed Bot on Twitter.
[00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:00.960]   You're still on the Twitter.
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:03.040]   Oh, I'm still on the Twitter.
[00:51:03.040 --> 00:51:03.840]   I love Ed's Twitter.
[00:51:03.840 --> 00:51:04.800]   Just Ed, thank you so much.
[00:51:04.800 --> 00:51:06.600]   Ed, you're a lot of great Twitter lately.
[00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:08.040]   It's a great Twitter.
[00:51:08.040 --> 00:51:09.960]   It is really-- it is well worth following.
[00:51:09.960 --> 00:51:12.280]   It's one of the few reasons I stay on Twitter, honestly.
[00:51:12.280 --> 00:51:13.720]   Everyone's in a while.
[00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:16.000]   You can talk about tech.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:17.840]   Well, and you know, it's really--
[00:51:17.840 --> 00:51:20.920]   it's a lot more fun to follow these events,
[00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:23.200]   like the Apple event and the Microsoft event
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:25.720]   when you can follow it through Ed.
[00:51:25.720 --> 00:51:29.720]   By the way, Ed is participating in the traditional Halloween
[00:51:29.720 --> 00:51:32.000]   renaming on Twitter.
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:37.280]   His Halloween name 404, Halloween name not found.
[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:38.720]   Thank you.
[00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:40.240]   Thank you.
[00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:42.120]   Our show today brought-- oh, and I forgot,
[00:51:42.120 --> 00:51:43.960]   Renee Richie, imore.com.
[00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:45.200]   I gave-- I gave Ed a plug.
[00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:47.280]   Forgot to give you one, imore.com/vector
[00:51:47.280 --> 00:51:49.360]   for the fabulous vector podcast.
[00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:50.120]   Thank you so much.
[00:51:50.120 --> 00:51:51.560]   Renee's normally on Mac Break Weekly.
[00:51:51.560 --> 00:51:52.760]   Won't be here to his Tuesday.
[00:51:52.760 --> 00:51:54.080]   I guess he's got a date in Brooklyn.
[00:51:54.080 --> 00:51:55.160]   So I snuck in early.
[00:51:55.160 --> 00:51:55.680]   Yeah.
[00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:57.360]   We thought we'd put him on now.
[00:51:57.360 --> 00:51:59.920]   And Jason Heiner, the great Jason Heiner from Tech
[00:51:59.920 --> 00:52:04.080]   Republic Editor-in-Chief there, he's also at CBS Interactive.
[00:52:04.080 --> 00:52:06.520]   And I guess you'll be writing more than a few Red Hat
[00:52:06.520 --> 00:52:09.480]   stories over the next few days.
[00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:12.520]   Not me, but I have people that will be--
[00:52:12.520 --> 00:52:13.760]   Mr. Vaughn.
[00:52:13.760 --> 00:52:14.760]   I'll be talking about it.
[00:52:14.760 --> 00:52:15.360]   That's for sure.
[00:52:15.360 --> 00:52:17.520]   Our show today brought to you by Audible.
[00:52:17.520 --> 00:52:20.000]   I love-- I don't get to do enough Audible ads.
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.800]   These days, I save up my Audible picks for the Audible ads.
[00:52:22.800 --> 00:52:25.160]   Audible is a life changer.
[00:52:25.160 --> 00:52:29.920]   I've been an Audible customer since 2000, 18 years now.
[00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:33.200]   And it's kept me from many a road rage incident.
[00:52:33.200 --> 00:52:35.440]   And any time I've got free time, whether it's in the car,
[00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:37.640]   doing the dishes, I love Audible now,
[00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:39.360]   because I could put Audible on my Sonos.
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:40.400]   We listen on our Sonos.
[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:41.960]   I could put it on my Amazon Echo.
[00:52:41.960 --> 00:52:43.440]   I listen on my Amazon Echo.
[00:52:43.440 --> 00:52:45.120]   Of course, I listen on my phone.
[00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:47.720]   And there's so many good books out there.
[00:52:47.720 --> 00:52:49.480]   I'm going to give you some recommendations
[00:52:49.480 --> 00:52:50.120]   before I do.
[00:52:50.120 --> 00:52:52.200]   I'll tell you, you could start a 30-day trial
[00:52:52.200 --> 00:52:55.600]   and get your first audiobook free right now.
[00:52:55.600 --> 00:53:04.200]   If you visit audible.com/twit or text "twit" to 500-500.
[00:53:04.200 --> 00:53:05.840]   Another feature that Audible's just added
[00:53:05.840 --> 00:53:09.080]   that I'm a huge fan of is these Audible originals.
[00:53:09.080 --> 00:53:12.160]   So you not only get the credit for an audiobook,
[00:53:12.160 --> 00:53:14.920]   you'll also get two Audible originals every month
[00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:16.960]   from a rotating selection.
[00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:18.960]   And I have been really enjoying that.
[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:25.320]   I'm listening to Hi, Bob, which is Bob Newhart's podcast.
[00:53:25.320 --> 00:53:28.040]   That's one of the Audible originals for the month of October.
[00:53:28.040 --> 00:53:30.600]   I'm looking forward to next month.
[00:53:30.600 --> 00:53:34.800]   But there's other great Audible originals of all kinds.
[00:53:34.800 --> 00:53:35.520]   Really fun.
[00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:36.760]   And they're free.
[00:53:36.760 --> 00:53:38.840]   There's something you get.
[00:53:38.840 --> 00:53:40.480]   It's part of being a membership.
[00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:43.240]   Audible members also get to access audio fitness and health
[00:53:43.240 --> 00:53:46.120]   workouts created exclusively for Audible.
[00:53:46.120 --> 00:53:47.360]   Nice thing about the credits.
[00:53:47.360 --> 00:53:48.120]   They roll over.
[00:53:48.120 --> 00:53:51.880]   So I'm sitting on two credits right now.
[00:53:51.880 --> 00:53:53.120]   And I don't know.
[00:53:53.120 --> 00:53:56.560]   I'll tell you what I've been listening to lately.
[00:53:56.560 --> 00:53:57.640]   And I've really enjoyed.
[00:53:57.640 --> 00:54:00.000]   And this I want to really recommend.
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:04.480]   It was recommended to me by one of our chatters.
[00:54:04.480 --> 00:54:08.080]   And it took me a while to read, but I enjoyed every minute of it.
[00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:11.120]   It's by an author named Emore Tolls.
[00:54:11.120 --> 00:54:13.560]   It's called A Gentleman in Moscow.
[00:54:13.560 --> 00:54:16.120]   And I just loved it.
[00:54:16.120 --> 00:54:21.440]   It's about a Duke, a Russian Duke, who
[00:54:21.440 --> 00:54:25.560]   was made a non-person in the 1920s by the Bolsheviks
[00:54:25.560 --> 00:54:29.280]   and exiled to the Metropolitan Hotel in Moscow
[00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:31.000]   and lives there for 30 years.
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.840]   And it's about his 30-year life in the Metropolitan
[00:54:33.840 --> 00:54:37.040]   as the Communist Revolution swirls around him.
[00:54:37.040 --> 00:54:39.440]   And it really is an ode to friendship.
[00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:41.720]   I just adored it.
[00:54:41.720 --> 00:54:43.320]   Do you want to know Audible recommendation, Liam?
[00:54:43.320 --> 00:54:44.680]   From you, Jason, always.
[00:54:44.680 --> 00:54:46.920]   Because I got two credits just sitting here burning it all
[00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:47.920]   in my book.
[00:54:47.920 --> 00:54:48.760]   I got to use those.
[00:54:48.760 --> 00:54:50.920]   OK, I got a good one for you.
[00:54:50.920 --> 00:54:54.760]   "Washington's Farewell" by John Avalon.
[00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:56.280]   So it's about George Washington.
[00:54:56.280 --> 00:54:57.520]   One of the most famous things.
[00:54:57.520 --> 00:55:00.320]   It's kind of not taught much anymore.
[00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:06.160]   But for 150 years or so, it was a very well-known, very
[00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:08.920]   widely taught one of the most published things
[00:55:08.920 --> 00:55:12.040]   in American history was "Washington's Farewell Address."
[00:55:12.040 --> 00:55:15.280]   And it's essentially a--
[00:55:15.280 --> 00:55:17.040]   It could be more timely.
[00:55:17.040 --> 00:55:17.400]   I know.
[00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:19.200]   It couldn't be more timely.
[00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:20.040]   Oh, my gosh.
[00:55:20.040 --> 00:55:22.840]   So it's all about--
[00:55:22.840 --> 00:55:26.040]   it's in one sense a very gentlemanly
[00:55:26.040 --> 00:55:29.360]   polemic against partisan politics.
[00:55:29.360 --> 00:55:36.080]   But it deals also with foreign policy very closely
[00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:40.720]   and talks about the tone of our dialogue even as well.
[00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:41.840]   Couldn't be bad.
[00:55:41.840 --> 00:55:45.240]   So you couldn't find something that's more of an antidote
[00:55:45.240 --> 00:55:51.040]   to what you read and see every day in the news.
[00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:53.400]   And it's also mentioned in Hamilton.
[00:55:53.400 --> 00:55:55.120]   And I know that's a big thing for you too.
[00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:55.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:56.160]   Oh, yeah.
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:57.160]   Absolutely.
[00:55:57.160 --> 00:55:59.240]   100%.
[00:55:59.240 --> 00:56:02.480]   "Washington's Farewell," the founding father's warning
[00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:05.760]   to future generations by John Avalon.
[00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:08.000]   "Adirine, if you have a pick, don't hesitate.
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:09.920]   We like sharing our picks."
[00:56:09.920 --> 00:56:12.880]   And while you're thinking about that,
[00:56:12.880 --> 00:56:17.520]   let me remind you you can all go to audible.com/twit
[00:56:17.520 --> 00:56:20.280]   and start your 30-day trial, your free audiobook,
[00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:23.880]   or text "twit," T-W-I-T to 500 to 500.
[00:56:23.880 --> 00:56:28.400]   A-U-D-I-B-L-E.com/twit or text "twit" to 500.
[00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:29.240]   500.
[00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:30.880]   Lots of new features in the audio app
[00:56:30.880 --> 00:56:32.480]   if you haven't used it, including the ability
[00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:35.440]   to play directly the Sonos speakers, which is great,
[00:56:35.440 --> 00:56:37.360]   because I put my book in the whole house.
[00:56:37.360 --> 00:56:39.280]   And then as I'm doing stuff around the house,
[00:56:39.280 --> 00:56:42.680]   cooking, or cleaning, I can listen to it in every room,
[00:56:42.680 --> 00:56:44.560]   which is fantastic.
[00:56:44.560 --> 00:56:48.400]   You can send books, share books in your library with anyone.
[00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:50.560]   And if it's their first time accepting a book,
[00:56:50.560 --> 00:56:51.440]   they can listen free.
[00:56:51.440 --> 00:56:54.640]   You can share audio excerpts, which I want to start doing
[00:56:54.640 --> 00:56:56.240]   with friends.
[00:56:56.240 --> 00:56:57.360]   Listen faster or slower.
[00:56:57.360 --> 00:56:59.680]   I know many people listen to "twit" at twice the speed.
[00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:02.000]   You can do that with your audiobooks as well.
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   Audible.com/twit or text "twit" to 500 to 500.
[00:57:09.480 --> 00:57:13.040]   There's a couple of recommendations for you.
[00:57:13.040 --> 00:57:16.040]   I just got-- I watched on--
[00:57:16.040 --> 00:57:19.520]   I think it was at HBO or Showtime Benedict Cumberbatch
[00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:21.520]   in "Patrick Melrose."
[00:57:21.520 --> 00:57:23.240]   And then I found out that it's actually
[00:57:23.240 --> 00:57:27.960]   a biographical, true story as crazy as that sounds.
[00:57:27.960 --> 00:57:31.240]   And I got the entire "Patrick Melrose" novels.
[00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:34.840]   This is not for the young.
[00:57:34.840 --> 00:57:36.360]   But it is hysterical.
[00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:39.080]   Never mind bad news, some hope mother's milk, and at last,
[00:57:39.080 --> 00:57:44.280]   all five novels in one 27-hour audiobook.
[00:57:44.280 --> 00:57:46.520]   And I am truly enjoying it.
[00:57:46.520 --> 00:57:47.840]   Very well written, too.
[00:57:47.840 --> 00:57:53.720]   It's a Showtime, I guess, five-part series on Showtime.
[00:57:53.720 --> 00:57:59.080]   Let's see here moving along back to the tech news.
[00:57:59.080 --> 00:58:04.240]   The president-- yeah, you just laugh when I say that,
[00:58:04.240 --> 00:58:05.240]   don't you?
[00:58:05.240 --> 00:58:07.040]   The president, according to "The New York Times,"
[00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:09.120]   has three phones, all three of them iPhones.
[00:58:09.120 --> 00:58:11.120]   Two of them are carefully modified
[00:58:11.120 --> 00:58:12.600]   to be secure by the Secret Service.
[00:58:12.600 --> 00:58:15.200]   One, for instance, only has Wi-Fi.
[00:58:15.200 --> 00:58:19.400]   The third is a stock iPhone, which, according to the Times,
[00:58:19.400 --> 00:58:22.400]   the president keeps because it has his contact list on it.
[00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:27.160]   And that's the one he uses to make phone calls.
[00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:29.680]   And according to "The New York Times,"
[00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:31.760]   it's the one the Chinese and Russians
[00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:35.200]   are hoping he'll use because they can listen in.
[00:58:35.200 --> 00:58:41.000]   So all of us have experienced doing tech support for older people.
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:42.720]   Yeah, that's what it's like.
[00:58:42.720 --> 00:58:45.280]   But it's my contacts are on this one.
[00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:47.360]   And it's the CIA.
[00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:50.840]   The best part of this story to me--
[00:58:50.840 --> 00:58:55.880]   there's so much of it that's just horrifying and stupid and wrong.
[00:58:55.880 --> 00:58:57.320]   But the best part of it, I think,
[00:58:57.320 --> 00:59:04.240]   was the Chinese trade minister who said, yes, you should use
[00:59:04.240 --> 00:59:06.840]   a Huawei phone.
[00:59:06.840 --> 00:59:08.200]   It would be secure.
[00:59:08.200 --> 00:59:11.920]   That was an amazing troll on that one.
[00:59:11.920 --> 00:59:14.880]   I got big props to that one.
[00:59:14.880 --> 00:59:17.800]   When it said that, I just imagined him putting it on speaker
[00:59:17.800 --> 00:59:20.240]   and holding it to his ear the way you see people in coffee shops.
[00:59:20.240 --> 00:59:20.720]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:59:20.720 --> 00:59:21.640]   Talk on the phone.
[00:59:21.640 --> 00:59:22.480]   Really loud.
[00:59:22.480 --> 00:59:23.880]   They're breaking here.
[00:59:23.880 --> 00:59:25.040]   They don't know there's an earpiece.
[00:59:25.040 --> 00:59:26.480]   It's like on FaceTime or something.
[00:59:26.480 --> 00:59:28.200]   And it's like up to their ear.
[00:59:28.200 --> 00:59:28.680]   We do.
[00:59:28.680 --> 00:59:30.400]   Yeah, that's some serious shade.
[00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:34.200]   The Huawei thing was some big time shooting.
[00:59:34.200 --> 00:59:36.320]   And ZTE is going, what about some love for us?
[00:59:36.320 --> 00:59:37.160]   Really nothing?
[00:59:37.160 --> 00:59:37.680]   Sorry.
[00:59:37.680 --> 00:59:42.040]   Actually, I talked with a PR person from Huawei just this week.
[00:59:42.040 --> 00:59:43.440]   Because I really liked the P20.
[00:59:43.440 --> 00:59:45.880]   But I said to her, the first thing it does is say,
[00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:49.320]   can we send everything you're doing back to the office?
[00:59:49.320 --> 00:59:51.160]   She said, here's the good news.
[00:59:51.160 --> 00:59:53.040]   That's all sent to Germany.
[00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:54.600]   Not to China.
[00:59:54.600 --> 00:59:55.640]   Why?
[00:59:55.640 --> 00:59:57.200]   So there, I feel better.
[00:59:57.200 --> 00:59:58.360]   It actually is good.
[00:59:58.360 --> 01:00:01.200]   Actually, it's much-- if you're going to send to one country
[01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:02.640]   in the world, send it to Germany.
[01:00:02.640 --> 01:00:04.000]   Exactly.
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:06.040]   I really like the P20.
[01:00:06.040 --> 01:00:09.200]   And they have a new one, the Mate Pro 20, which
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:12.160]   is just spectacular phone.
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:14.960]   But they can't get it sold in the United States
[01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:17.880]   because the Commerce Department basically went to Verizon.
[01:00:17.880 --> 01:00:18.480]   And I can't remember.
[01:00:18.480 --> 01:00:19.240]   Was it AT&T?
[01:00:19.240 --> 01:00:21.320]   And said, it would be a mistake for you
[01:00:21.320 --> 01:00:22.520]   to carry this phone in your room.
[01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:23.880]   And you can get it in Canada, Leo.
[01:00:23.880 --> 01:00:25.960]   You can boot the booths across the border with the phones.
[01:00:25.960 --> 01:00:28.400]   You can buy this phone in every other country in the world
[01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:29.640]   except the United States.
[01:00:29.640 --> 01:00:31.960]   Because Huawei didn't-- it's not that you couldn't.
[01:00:31.960 --> 01:00:34.600]   But Huawei didn't want to spend time marketing something
[01:00:34.600 --> 01:00:37.360]   in the US if you couldn't get it from carriers.
[01:00:37.360 --> 01:00:42.840]   And so on Earth 2, just like--
[01:00:42.840 --> 01:00:49.600]   Just like people from China used to fly to the United States
[01:00:49.600 --> 01:00:52.240]   to be here for the introduction of a new iPhone
[01:00:52.240 --> 01:00:55.600]   so that they could pay people to stand in line
[01:00:55.600 --> 01:00:58.280]   and then buy suitcases full of iPhones
[01:00:58.280 --> 01:00:59.800]   that they would take back to China.
[01:00:59.800 --> 01:01:05.120]   On Earth 2, there are plain loads of people
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:08.360]   going to China to buy a Huawei phones,
[01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:11.440]   to bring them back to the US, to give them
[01:01:11.440 --> 01:01:15.520]   to people who are eagerly waiting for this--
[01:01:15.520 --> 01:01:16.160]   I actually--
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:17.320]   You can blame on Amazon.
[01:01:17.320 --> 01:01:18.880]   I bought a P20 and I was--
[01:01:18.880 --> 01:01:20.960]   it's a great camera, a really nice phone.
[01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:23.240]   I'm not crazy about their version of Android.
[01:01:23.240 --> 01:01:24.520]   It's highly customized and I--
[01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:25.480]   It's the purple back, Leo.
[01:01:25.480 --> 01:01:27.160]   Once you have a purple back, it's the best one either.
[01:01:27.160 --> 01:01:28.080]   It's very pretty.
[01:01:28.080 --> 01:01:30.160]   Very pretty.
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:34.240]   So I don't-- the president says it's fake news.
[01:01:34.240 --> 01:01:36.440]   That's kind of his go-to anyway.
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:37.440]   I kind of believe it.
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:39.400]   The Times said the story was leaked to us
[01:01:39.400 --> 01:01:41.840]   by White House staffers who were so frustrated
[01:01:41.840 --> 01:01:44.960]   by trying to get Trump to not use his unsecure phone.
[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:46.640]   They just said, we've got to tell the Times maybe.
[01:01:46.640 --> 01:01:47.560]   But how does he have a choice?
[01:01:47.560 --> 01:01:49.320]   Like you hear stories from every previous president
[01:01:49.320 --> 01:01:51.360]   who literally had their BlackBerry iPhone or Windows
[01:01:51.360 --> 01:01:55.480]   port on to their hand and an NSA phone shoved back into it?
[01:01:55.480 --> 01:01:56.040]   Norms.
[01:01:56.040 --> 01:01:57.120]   They had no choice.
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:01:58.000]   Yeah.
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:58.880]   Norms.
[01:01:58.880 --> 01:02:03.840]   It's the-- other presidents said, oh, OK.
[01:02:03.840 --> 01:02:07.320]   Well, when the NSA or the CIA tells me
[01:02:07.320 --> 01:02:09.960]   that I should do something because it's
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:15.440]   a major national security issue, then they did it.
[01:02:15.440 --> 01:02:16.400]   That's how it used to work.
[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:16.960]   Yeah.
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:19.800]   But you are the president, the leader of the free world,
[01:02:19.800 --> 01:02:21.480]   and you can say no.
[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:22.920]   You can do whatever you want, really.
[01:02:22.920 --> 01:02:24.320]   But like the Secret Service grabbed you
[01:02:24.320 --> 01:02:25.000]   and take it out of a building.
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:25.840]   You can't say no.
[01:02:25.840 --> 01:02:26.840]   There are certain things--
[01:02:26.840 --> 01:02:27.400]   No, they don't.
[01:02:27.400 --> 01:02:28.720]   Oh, we heard an explosion.
[01:02:28.720 --> 01:02:30.720]   We are physically removing you from the building.
[01:02:30.720 --> 01:02:31.440]   That you can't say.
[01:02:31.440 --> 01:02:32.760]   We are taking your phone.
[01:02:32.760 --> 01:02:34.760]   There should be certain things that are just like--
[01:02:34.760 --> 01:02:35.720]   It seems that.
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:37.960]   But he said, no, I'm keeping it.
[01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:39.960]   And I'm going to have two scoops of ice cream for dessert.
[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:41.920]   Thank you very much.
[01:02:41.920 --> 01:02:42.800]   That's why--
[01:02:42.800 --> 01:02:47.560]   The other favorite detail in that story for me
[01:02:47.560 --> 01:02:49.200]   was that they found--
[01:02:49.200 --> 01:02:52.440]   that I think, if I'm recalling this correctly,
[01:02:52.440 --> 01:02:55.000]   that he was going into the situation room alone
[01:02:55.000 --> 01:02:59.880]   to make phone calls because nobody would be able to--
[01:02:59.880 --> 01:03:01.360]   Safe.
[01:03:01.360 --> 01:03:04.000]   --you know, nobody would be able to monitor them.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:04.500]   Yeah.
[01:03:04.500 --> 01:03:05.440]   And I don't know.
[01:03:05.440 --> 01:03:05.940]   What?
[01:03:05.940 --> 01:03:08.080]   Is he trying to call David Pecker and say,
[01:03:08.080 --> 01:03:08.840]   where are the tapes?
[01:03:08.840 --> 01:03:09.840]   Where?
[01:03:09.840 --> 01:03:13.000]   Just say, are they still in the safe?
[01:03:13.000 --> 01:03:16.120]   Trump's tweet says, I always use a landline
[01:03:16.120 --> 01:03:17.000]   and never use a cell phone.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:18.680]   But of course, the New York Times led the article
[01:03:18.680 --> 01:03:23.760]   with a picture of him using an iPhone in the car.
[01:03:23.760 --> 01:03:25.520]   So who knows?
[01:03:25.520 --> 01:03:26.720]   We know he tweets from an iPhone.
[01:03:26.720 --> 01:03:27.880]   Like cigarettes.
[01:03:27.880 --> 01:03:28.520]   Quick the habit.
[01:03:28.520 --> 01:03:30.040]   Quick the habit.
[01:03:30.040 --> 01:03:34.200]   The question on probably a lot of people's minds who read this
[01:03:34.200 --> 01:03:35.160]   is, well, wait a minute.
[01:03:35.160 --> 01:03:36.680]   I thought the iPhone was secure.
[01:03:36.680 --> 01:03:39.400]   Renee, if you were the Chinese government
[01:03:39.400 --> 01:03:41.920]   or the Russian government, or I don't know anybody
[01:03:41.920 --> 01:03:44.280]   on the street who wanted to listen in on the president's
[01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:46.160]   phone calls because they got to be good,
[01:03:46.160 --> 01:03:48.320]   how would you go about doing it?
[01:03:48.320 --> 01:03:50.400]   I mean, the reason they used to take the other phones away
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:52.840]   in Blackberry was super secure back in the same--
[01:03:52.840 --> 01:03:53.840]   Maybe it's a presence.
[01:03:53.840 --> 01:03:56.760]   But Obama's Blackberry was immediately taken from him
[01:03:56.760 --> 01:03:59.680]   and he was given a kind of crappy Windows CE phone.
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:01.640]   Yeah, it's because once you're using a normal phone,
[01:04:01.640 --> 01:04:02.760]   there's all sorts of ways--
[01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:03.840]   you don't have to get on the phone.
[01:04:03.840 --> 01:04:06.560]   There's all sorts of radios being beamed out of that phone.
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:08.000]   All through the air, there's lines
[01:04:08.000 --> 01:04:10.360]   that are going out and through the carriers.
[01:04:10.360 --> 01:04:12.400]   US government does that all the time.
[01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:14.400]   It is rife for exfiltration.
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:17.760]   And you just don't want anybody using a non-hardened, non-NSA,
[01:04:17.760 --> 01:04:21.600]   non-completely-cryptoed phone for any means,
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:22.520]   any government thing.
[01:04:22.520 --> 01:04:25.880]   So Wired, Lilly, Hay Newman, and Wired had an article on,
[01:04:25.880 --> 01:04:27.880]   well, how would this work?
[01:04:27.880 --> 01:04:30.960]   One thing we know is there's stingrays all over Washington.
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:35.720]   Some of them run by national intelligence agencies.
[01:04:35.720 --> 01:04:37.560]   Some of them, we don't know who they're run by.
[01:04:37.560 --> 01:04:40.480]   Those are fake cell towers that can
[01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:44.280]   intercept phone calls and impersonate cell towers.
[01:04:44.280 --> 01:04:46.760]   They're like man in the middle attacks, but for cell phones.
[01:04:46.760 --> 01:04:50.400]   There's also the issue of SS7.
[01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:53.240]   She goes into this great detail.
[01:04:53.240 --> 01:04:59.240]   SS7 is the broadband software that's basically in all phones.
[01:04:59.240 --> 01:05:03.920]   And it was invented in 1975 and is laden with issues
[01:05:03.920 --> 01:05:06.120]   and has been hacked multiple times.
[01:05:06.120 --> 01:05:08.720]   And that would be another venue, another avenue.
[01:05:08.720 --> 01:05:11.400]   In fact, probably what you'd do is do both.
[01:05:11.400 --> 01:05:12.000]   Right?
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.560]   So I think you have to think, you know,
[01:05:14.560 --> 01:05:17.680]   I'm going to give the security community the benefit
[01:05:17.680 --> 01:05:21.800]   of the doubt here because there are a lot of really smart people
[01:05:21.800 --> 01:05:24.600]   that have served on multiple administrations that have
[01:05:24.600 --> 01:05:26.840]   been working on this stuff for a long time.
[01:05:26.840 --> 01:05:30.840]   And if this is the case, if this report's right,
[01:05:30.840 --> 01:05:35.080]   I have to believe that the moment he came in that they,
[01:05:35.080 --> 01:05:39.480]   for example, maybe swapped out that SIM card with some super
[01:05:39.480 --> 01:05:44.120]   encrypted, different kind of SIM cards.
[01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:46.280]   Like, yeah, yeah, you're not using that anymore.
[01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:49.080]   Maybe they even swapped out the iPhones themselves, right?
[01:05:49.080 --> 01:05:51.480]   And have, you know, versions that they've--
[01:05:51.480 --> 01:05:54.240]   Yeah, it's sure this looks like it felt,
[01:05:54.240 --> 01:05:58.000]   but they've swapped out the radios in it or something, right?
[01:05:58.000 --> 01:06:01.080]   So for all that he knows, he's using this on an iPhone,
[01:06:01.080 --> 01:06:05.680]   but it's a different device, you know, a bit on the inside.
[01:06:05.680 --> 01:06:08.280]   I just think they've been working on this problem.
[01:06:08.280 --> 01:06:11.680]   And for a long time, I'm sure that when Obama walked in,
[01:06:11.680 --> 01:06:13.480]   they told him and they showed him, like, look,
[01:06:13.480 --> 01:06:15.160]   we've got everything you've been doing.
[01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:16.760]   And when you think you're secure,
[01:06:16.760 --> 01:06:20.280]   we can show you that we've gotten all of your messages.
[01:06:20.280 --> 01:06:22.760]   There have been some sort of reports to that effect
[01:06:22.760 --> 01:06:25.160]   that showed how insecure it was.
[01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:28.320]   And that was, at the time, the most secure phone
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:32.560]   you could get straight off of the streets.
[01:06:32.560 --> 01:06:35.240]   So if this is the case, I don't think
[01:06:35.240 --> 01:06:39.800]   it's a case of utter incompetence on the part
[01:06:39.800 --> 01:06:41.000]   of the security community.
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:45.480]   I think that they likely have that thing locked down one way.
[01:06:45.480 --> 01:06:47.480]   Oh, God, I hope so.
[01:06:47.480 --> 01:06:49.840]   In 2016, President Obama--
[01:06:49.840 --> 01:06:51.600]   Couldn't be a target, though.
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:06:53.160]   Yeah, well, that's the other problem.
[01:06:53.160 --> 01:06:54.160]   He knows what he's--
[01:06:54.160 --> 01:06:56.480]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:06:56.480 --> 01:06:58.000]   I doubt it.
[01:06:58.000 --> 01:07:00.600]   I doubt he has that phone in his hands very often.
[01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:02.080]   I think that a lot--
[01:07:02.080 --> 01:07:04.800]   I think he's probably dictating a lot of those tweets
[01:07:04.800 --> 01:07:06.000]   to other people.
[01:07:06.000 --> 01:07:07.160]   I mean, I mean, I mean--
[01:07:07.160 --> 01:07:10.840]   2016, Obama got the first presidential smartphone,
[01:07:10.840 --> 01:07:15.840]   but he told Jimmy Fallon, it's more like a toddler phone.
[01:07:15.840 --> 01:07:17.640]   Weren't there-- because of it, it was like a suit.
[01:07:17.640 --> 01:07:19.720]   It was like, was running Windows embedded or something.
[01:07:19.720 --> 01:07:21.560]   It was like, completely hardened.
[01:07:21.560 --> 01:07:22.560]   Yeah.
[01:07:22.560 --> 01:07:23.560]   Yeah.
[01:07:23.560 --> 01:07:25.520]   You know, most of those people in Washington,
[01:07:25.520 --> 01:07:29.120]   like the DOJ and Secret Service and all of that,
[01:07:29.120 --> 01:07:32.320]   99% of the people that work in those agencies
[01:07:32.320 --> 01:07:34.920]   are professionals that work there
[01:07:34.920 --> 01:07:36.840]   and have worked there for a long time.
[01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:38.760]   They tend to have people tend to be in those jobs
[01:07:38.760 --> 01:07:40.120]   for a long, long time.
[01:07:40.120 --> 01:07:41.720]   And such a small percentage of them
[01:07:41.720 --> 01:07:43.440]   are political appointees.
[01:07:43.440 --> 01:07:45.800]   And they're a bit firewalled from the rest
[01:07:45.800 --> 01:07:47.240]   of what really happens, right?
[01:07:47.240 --> 01:07:48.880]   They're more public spokespeople.
[01:07:48.880 --> 01:07:49.840]   Yes.
[01:07:49.840 --> 01:07:53.320]   I think, thank you for speaking, calming us all down
[01:07:53.320 --> 01:07:57.160]   a little bit, Jason, because I think you're absolutely right.
[01:07:57.160 --> 01:07:58.360]   I mean, who knows what he's doing,
[01:07:58.360 --> 01:08:01.840]   but I'm sure that there are trained professionals.
[01:08:01.840 --> 01:08:03.280]   The minute that phone is put on the desk,
[01:08:03.280 --> 01:08:04.720]   it is swept on your night off today.
[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:07.480]   Off-sec professionals who are doing something.
[01:08:07.480 --> 01:08:08.760]   Yeah.
[01:08:08.760 --> 01:08:11.000]   Meanwhile, according to Vox,
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.280]   the midterms are already hacked.
[01:08:12.280 --> 01:08:14.480]   You just don't know it yet.
[01:08:14.480 --> 01:08:16.200]   We had last week Dan Patterson on,
[01:08:16.200 --> 01:08:19.800]   who's done a really great thing for CBS on election hacking
[01:08:19.800 --> 01:08:23.160]   or 10-piece thing for CBS Radio News,
[01:08:23.160 --> 01:08:26.960]   a similar article quoting an investigation
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:29.720]   into the US election system
[01:08:29.720 --> 01:08:33.400]   showing, according to Vox, frightening vulnerabilities
[01:08:33.400 --> 01:08:35.520]   at almost every level.
[01:08:36.640 --> 01:08:39.280]   The good news is, and Dan referred to this,
[01:08:39.280 --> 01:08:43.240]   is that we have such a heterogeneous voting system
[01:08:43.240 --> 01:08:45.480]   that it's really county by county,
[01:08:45.480 --> 01:08:48.360]   and so it'd be very hard to do kind of a mass hack.
[01:08:48.360 --> 01:08:50.400]   The other side of that equation is
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:54.520]   the nature of electoral politics in this country
[01:08:54.520 --> 01:08:57.800]   is that it doesn't take that many votes to sway
[01:08:57.800 --> 01:08:59.320]   an election one way or the other.
[01:08:59.320 --> 01:09:00.720]   And in the right place.
[01:09:00.720 --> 01:09:01.880]   In the right place.
[01:09:01.880 --> 01:09:03.920]   That's what really matters.
[01:09:03.920 --> 01:09:07.680]   The 2016 election was pretty much came down
[01:09:07.680 --> 01:09:10.280]   to roughly 80,000 votes
[01:09:10.280 --> 01:09:15.280]   in a handful of small regions in four states,
[01:09:15.280 --> 01:09:17.840]   sort of clustered around the Great Lakes.
[01:09:17.840 --> 01:09:26.040]   You don't need to bus in people to pull the lever
[01:09:26.040 --> 01:09:29.720]   using fake IDs.
[01:09:29.720 --> 01:09:32.720]   All you need to do is either change a few votes
[01:09:32.720 --> 01:09:37.720]   or suppress a few votes in a few key areas.
[01:09:37.720 --> 01:09:41.640]   - So we did a seven part series on Tech Republic
[01:09:41.640 --> 01:09:44.360]   where we went to states and we talked to them
[01:09:44.360 --> 01:09:46.800]   'cause a lot of this is handled not at the federal level,
[01:09:46.800 --> 01:09:48.000]   at the state level.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.880]   There's a big federal grant that was given out
[01:09:51.880 --> 01:09:54.400]   and the states could apply for that money.
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:57.600]   And then, so our series looked at what the states
[01:09:57.600 --> 01:10:02.160]   have actually been doing to secure the 2018 midterms
[01:10:02.160 --> 01:10:03.160]   over the past two years.
[01:10:03.160 --> 01:10:05.280]   So we've got Illinois, we've got Florida,
[01:10:05.280 --> 01:10:08.440]   we've got Ohio, West Virginia, which is using blockchain
[01:10:08.440 --> 01:10:09.720]   and experiment with blockchain.
[01:10:09.720 --> 01:10:11.240]   As probably many people have heard about,
[01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:14.680]   Washington and a couple others, Pennsylvania,
[01:10:14.680 --> 01:10:16.240]   which is going back to paper.
[01:10:16.240 --> 01:10:18.560]   And we talk about in this series,
[01:10:18.560 --> 01:10:20.960]   the steps that are being done,
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:23.480]   the ways that they're changing auditing,
[01:10:23.480 --> 01:10:27.720]   the ways that paper is being used to back up votes
[01:10:27.720 --> 01:10:30.720]   and the ways that they're using resources
[01:10:30.720 --> 01:10:32.400]   that they have at their disposal,
[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:34.640]   like in many cases, universities,
[01:10:34.640 --> 01:10:37.680]   where they have university experts in cybersecurity,
[01:10:37.680 --> 01:10:40.880]   or in some cases, even their military,
[01:10:40.880 --> 01:10:44.400]   like their national guard and folks like that,
[01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:46.160]   where they have cybersecurity experts
[01:10:46.160 --> 01:10:48.680]   and they're bringing them in to consult
[01:10:48.680 --> 01:10:50.320]   and make sure the elections are locked down.
[01:10:50.320 --> 01:10:52.200]   So I think if you read that seven part series
[01:10:52.200 --> 01:10:54.660]   on Tech Republic, you'll feel a little bit better
[01:10:54.660 --> 01:10:56.880]   about the people that are trying to do this
[01:10:56.880 --> 01:10:57.840]   in really smart ways.
[01:10:57.840 --> 01:11:02.760]   Actually, the one that's been using some really smart ways
[01:11:02.760 --> 01:11:04.960]   to attack this for a long time is Colorado.
[01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:08.640]   And we also have them in the series as well.
[01:11:08.640 --> 01:11:13.640]   So be confident that there are smart people
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:16.320]   working on this problem.
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:18.280]   It doesn't mean that it's gonna be foolproof,
[01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:21.560]   but they are serious and they have been seriously working
[01:11:21.560 --> 01:11:22.800]   on this for a couple of years.
[01:11:22.800 --> 01:11:27.280]   And it's not perfect, but they have made a lot of progress
[01:11:27.280 --> 01:11:28.400]   since 2016.
[01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:31.440]   - And of course, it's not just the US.
[01:11:31.440 --> 01:11:34.000]   In fact, the Brazilian election is over now.
[01:11:34.000 --> 01:11:36.600]   As of today, the far right evangelical,
[01:11:36.600 --> 01:11:40.520]   Haribo Sonaro is now president of Brazil.
[01:11:40.520 --> 01:11:43.040]   And there is definitely an internet component
[01:11:43.040 --> 01:11:47.720]   and interesting article on BuzzFeed News today about that.
[01:11:47.720 --> 01:11:49.040]   So, but that's politics.
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:52.280]   I won't get too far into politics.
[01:11:52.280 --> 01:11:54.160]   However, let's talk about this one.
[01:11:54.160 --> 01:11:56.240]   And this is the story that just keeps on giving.
[01:11:56.240 --> 01:12:00.280]   We're talking about the Bloomberg Super Micro Chinese Hack Story.
[01:12:00.280 --> 01:12:03.280]   Now Amazon has pulled its ads from Bloomberg
[01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:08.000]   and sources say according to Joseph Bernstein at BuzzFeed,
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:10.880]   both Amazon and Apple are taking retributive measures
[01:12:10.880 --> 01:12:12.280]   against Bloomberg.
[01:12:12.280 --> 01:12:14.840]   Apple did not invite Bloomberg to its event.
[01:12:14.840 --> 01:12:17.320]   - Oh no, shock is Mark Herman, right?
[01:12:17.320 --> 01:12:19.560]   I mean, he's not the one who reported that,
[01:12:19.560 --> 01:12:20.880]   but he wasn't gonna get it uploaded.
[01:12:20.880 --> 01:12:22.000]   - He wasn't gonna get invited anyway, I suspect.
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:24.120]   - No, he's been to all the most recent Apple events.
[01:12:24.120 --> 01:12:25.240]   Yeah, he's been to every one of them
[01:12:25.240 --> 01:12:26.200]   since he went to Bloomberg.
[01:12:26.200 --> 01:12:28.720]   - Well, I wonder if he's not going
[01:12:28.720 --> 01:12:32.400]   and pulling ads, Amazon pulling ads from Bloomberg.
[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:35.480]   This is, well, you've dealt with this ad bottom, sure.
[01:12:35.480 --> 01:12:38.120]   And I remember the Ziff Davis had a very good
[01:12:38.120 --> 01:12:41.480]   and admirable policy for years not to give in
[01:12:41.480 --> 01:12:44.800]   to this kind of blackmail from companies over advertising.
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:46.800]   - Yeah, access journalism, you know?
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:48.480]   - Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[01:12:48.480 --> 01:12:52.440]   I mean, the firewall between advertising
[01:12:52.440 --> 01:12:55.760]   and editorial is there.
[01:12:55.760 --> 01:13:00.760]   And so advertisers are free to pull their ads
[01:13:00.760 --> 01:13:04.360]   and they did, I mean, I remember that they did.
[01:13:04.360 --> 01:13:07.280]   And I cannot remember a single time
[01:13:07.280 --> 01:13:09.960]   that we were ever told to change our coverage.
[01:13:09.960 --> 01:13:14.960]   That being said, this story is so far off the rails
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:18.800]   of anything I have ever seen.
[01:13:18.800 --> 01:13:22.760]   There's, I've never seen a story
[01:13:22.760 --> 01:13:26.920]   where all of the primary subjects of it
[01:13:26.920 --> 01:13:31.920]   are denying in the most unequivocal terms.
[01:13:31.920 --> 01:13:36.360]   There's no weasel words, there's no,
[01:13:36.360 --> 01:13:39.280]   oh, well, they left out this thing there
[01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:40.720]   so that leaves the possibility
[01:13:40.720 --> 01:13:43.600]   that maybe they're hiding this thing in there.
[01:13:43.600 --> 01:13:45.440]   I mean, unequivocal denials,
[01:13:46.840 --> 01:13:51.840]   sources who are backing down from the gist of the story
[01:13:51.840 --> 01:13:56.400]   and saying we don't support the gist of the story.
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:59.200]   And even people in the government who are saying,
[01:13:59.200 --> 01:14:02.640]   we've looked at this and we can't find any evidence of this.
[01:14:02.640 --> 01:14:07.320]   And Bloomberg is, the thing that I find just baffling about
[01:14:07.320 --> 01:14:09.360]   this is that Bloomberg is simply saying,
[01:14:09.360 --> 01:14:11.440]   well, we stand behind our story.
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:14.440]   Rather than saying, okay,
[01:14:15.760 --> 01:14:18.040]   we didn't wanna have to do this, but here,
[01:14:18.040 --> 01:14:22.320]   this is where if you're really good investigative reporters,
[01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:25.360]   you have a suitcase full of documents
[01:14:25.360 --> 01:14:27.800]   and you bring the suitcase in and you open it up
[01:14:27.800 --> 01:14:31.320]   and you pull these things out and they land on the table
[01:14:31.320 --> 01:14:34.400]   with a satisfying thunk.
[01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:37.440]   And then you start,
[01:14:37.440 --> 01:14:39.840]   and then you start going through them
[01:14:39.840 --> 01:14:42.360]   and explaining why you wrote the story you did.
[01:14:42.360 --> 01:14:46.600]   And the fact that Bloomberg has not mounted
[01:14:46.600 --> 01:14:51.600]   a defense of this story just confounds me.
[01:14:51.600 --> 01:14:53.120]   I don't--
[01:14:53.120 --> 01:14:54.520]   - It doesn't pass the smell test.
[01:14:54.520 --> 01:14:56.640]   This was a starting to get to where it doesn't pass
[01:14:56.640 --> 01:14:58.360]   the smell test.
[01:14:58.360 --> 01:14:59.520]   I agree with Ed.
[01:14:59.520 --> 01:15:03.320]   It's, it feels like they should be more vigorously
[01:15:03.320 --> 01:15:07.520]   defending it or saying, look, we're gonna go back
[01:15:07.520 --> 01:15:10.640]   and look, we wanna make sure the truth comes out, right?
[01:15:10.640 --> 01:15:12.120]   We're about telling the truth.
[01:15:12.120 --> 01:15:15.320]   And that's our job and we're gonna make sure we do it right.
[01:15:15.320 --> 01:15:16.960]   And so we're gonna go back to,
[01:15:16.960 --> 01:15:19.760]   and look at these sources again and dig deeper
[01:15:19.760 --> 01:15:22.800]   and we'll let you know what we find out kind of thing.
[01:15:22.800 --> 01:15:24.960]   - It just baffles me.
[01:15:24.960 --> 01:15:28.560]   They really, I mean, this is a prestigious publication
[01:15:28.560 --> 01:15:31.360]   that put its reputation on the line.
[01:15:31.360 --> 01:15:33.400]   - Although this writer seems to be not the first time
[01:15:33.400 --> 01:15:36.080]   this has happened with his particular stories.
[01:15:36.080 --> 01:15:37.240]   - Well, there's two writers on them.
[01:15:37.240 --> 01:15:41.000]   One of them is a very technical and understands a lot.
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:46.000]   The other, there was a story that he said that the NSA,
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:49.080]   I'm trying to remember what the details of it were,
[01:15:49.080 --> 01:15:50.680]   but the NSA had done something
[01:15:50.680 --> 01:15:51.880]   and no one else could confirm it,
[01:15:51.880 --> 01:15:54.600]   but it was never proven wrong either.
[01:15:54.600 --> 01:15:57.240]   So I doubt that,
[01:15:57.240 --> 01:16:01.640]   I doubt that Bloomberg management,
[01:16:01.640 --> 01:16:03.760]   their editor in chief was very respected
[01:16:03.760 --> 01:16:06.480]   and they'd worked on this for two years.
[01:16:06.480 --> 01:16:09.080]   I doubt that they would, you know,
[01:16:09.080 --> 01:16:12.800]   let this guy make a big mistake or lie.
[01:16:12.800 --> 01:16:14.360]   I just don't understand the deal.
[01:16:14.360 --> 01:16:16.760]   - The story that I've heard and it's like sort of making
[01:16:16.760 --> 01:16:19.440]   the rounds is that this, it really is Red Team Three
[01:16:19.440 --> 01:16:21.520]   from the newsroom, which is absurd,
[01:16:21.520 --> 01:16:24.760]   but there was a story sort of given that was so compelling
[01:16:24.760 --> 01:16:26.360]   that everything else that he looked at
[01:16:26.360 --> 01:16:27.520]   was through the lens of that story.
[01:16:27.520 --> 01:16:29.600]   It wasn't, does this make,
[01:16:29.600 --> 01:16:31.240]   like he didn't go out and interview people
[01:16:31.240 --> 01:16:32.280]   and say what is happening.
[01:16:32.280 --> 01:16:34.320]   He's like, does everything he heard was,
[01:16:34.320 --> 01:16:37.240]   can I use this to corroborate this really compelling story
[01:16:37.240 --> 01:16:38.800]   that I wanna get published?
[01:16:38.800 --> 01:16:42.200]   And when you hear bits of report it.
[01:16:42.200 --> 01:16:43.560]   - He'd been working on it for two years.
[01:16:43.560 --> 01:16:45.200]   They had 17 sources.
[01:16:45.200 --> 01:16:46.560]   - Wouldn't, at some point--
[01:16:46.560 --> 01:16:48.280]   - But doesn't tell any of what they say.
[01:16:48.280 --> 01:16:50.160]   Like those sources could be corroborating--
[01:16:50.160 --> 01:16:51.000]   - He could make a mistake.
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:51.840]   - He could make a mistake.
[01:16:51.840 --> 01:16:52.680]   - Yeah, yeah.
[01:16:52.680 --> 01:16:55.280]   - It's still China, it's still a black box, you know.
[01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:59.360]   - So does it make sense that if this did happen
[01:16:59.360 --> 01:17:02.760]   that eventually sometime in the near future,
[01:17:02.760 --> 01:17:04.080]   somebody would come forward and say,
[01:17:04.080 --> 01:17:05.880]   "Yeah, here's a super micro motherboard here."
[01:17:05.880 --> 01:17:07.200]   - Get them some information
[01:17:07.200 --> 01:17:09.880]   on the FBI investigation at some point, right?
[01:17:09.880 --> 01:17:11.960]   - Well, but if you say national security
[01:17:11.960 --> 01:17:15.040]   you could probably keep all that information secret.
[01:17:15.040 --> 01:17:16.400]   - Sometimes you can.
[01:17:16.400 --> 01:17:17.240]   - Sometimes you can.
[01:17:17.240 --> 01:17:18.560]   - Yeah.
[01:17:18.560 --> 01:17:20.840]   - I think we'll know one way or another on this story.
[01:17:20.840 --> 01:17:25.840]   It will go down as one of the biggest blunder investigations
[01:17:25.840 --> 01:17:32.480]   of all time or it will come out that actually they were right
[01:17:32.480 --> 01:17:35.800]   and this has been hidden and even all of these companies
[01:17:35.800 --> 01:17:36.720]   that are denying it.
[01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:39.680]   - Even that, that would be the worst shocking.
[01:17:39.680 --> 01:17:44.680]   - Right, and so the one possible explanation that I've heard
[01:17:44.680 --> 01:17:49.480]   and it's pure speculation, there's no evidence for this
[01:17:49.480 --> 01:17:53.400]   but then again, there's no evidence for the story itself
[01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:57.360]   is that this was a disinform,
[01:17:57.360 --> 01:18:02.360]   is that the possibility that this is a disinformation campaign
[01:18:02.360 --> 01:18:04.040]   from the US government.
[01:18:04.040 --> 01:18:08.840]   And that somebody, yeah, that somebody planted this story
[01:18:08.840 --> 01:18:12.920]   as a way to, you know, reduce confidence,
[01:18:12.920 --> 01:18:13.920]   - And confidence,
[01:18:13.920 --> 01:18:15.680]   - And change. - Reduce confidence.
[01:18:15.680 --> 01:18:19.720]   - Yeah, I mean, look, our administration
[01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:23.040]   doesn't want us buying stuff made in China, period.
[01:18:23.040 --> 01:18:26.120]   That you don't need to go too far to find a motive for that.
[01:18:26.120 --> 01:18:29.720]   I'm increasingly of the opinion that this must be
[01:18:29.720 --> 01:18:32.000]   what happened, that it was planted.
[01:18:32.000 --> 01:18:33.720]   - It's sort of like what Andy said on Macbreak,
[01:18:33.720 --> 01:18:36.040]   where like you'd think by now, someone else would have talked,
[01:18:36.040 --> 01:18:37.400]   like someone in the investigation,
[01:18:37.400 --> 01:18:38.840]   someone else who'd heard this,
[01:18:38.840 --> 01:18:41.120]   some other like the New York Times is investing huge,
[01:18:41.120 --> 01:18:43.920]   other outlets are spending a fortune trying to find
[01:18:43.920 --> 01:18:45.480]   whether they can prove or disprove this
[01:18:45.480 --> 01:18:46.400]   and there's been nothing.
[01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:47.880]   - Nothing, but there's a silence.
[01:18:47.880 --> 01:18:49.320]   There's been nothing with silence.
[01:18:49.320 --> 01:18:50.840]   One way or another.
[01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:52.080]   - Well, but you can't disprove a negative.
[01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:54.160]   So like they can, the New York Times can't say,
[01:18:54.160 --> 01:18:55.840]   we've proven it didn't happen, but you know,
[01:18:55.840 --> 01:18:57.720]   if they could, they would absolutely say,
[01:18:57.720 --> 01:18:59.520]   we found these other five sources
[01:18:59.520 --> 01:19:01.200]   who corroborate the Bloomberg story.
[01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:02.200]   - Right, right, right.
[01:19:02.200 --> 01:19:03.880]   That's a good point too.
[01:19:03.880 --> 01:19:06.800]   Amazon's fourth quarter results came out.
[01:19:06.800 --> 01:19:11.680]   Amazon's stock plunged 10% costing Jeff Bezos
[01:19:11.680 --> 01:19:14.240]   of $14 billion.
[01:19:14.240 --> 01:19:16.280]   He's no longer, I think, the richest man in the world.
[01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:18.200]   He's only number two, but that's okay.
[01:19:18.200 --> 01:19:19.520]   - He had to have it to lose it, Leo,
[01:19:19.520 --> 01:19:21.360]   and that's not a good chance.
[01:19:21.360 --> 01:19:22.200]   (laughing)
[01:19:22.200 --> 01:19:25.160]   - And you know what, it'll probably go right back up.
[01:19:25.160 --> 01:19:26.880]   One of the things I learned from this though,
[01:19:26.880 --> 01:19:30.120]   is how much money Amazon's making on advertising,
[01:19:30.120 --> 01:19:34.440]   online advertising, that is a huge business for Amazon.
[01:19:34.440 --> 01:19:36.120]   One you wouldn't really expect.
[01:19:36.120 --> 01:19:43.360]   And by the way, they are kind of profitable.
[01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:46.520]   So whether they met the street expectations.
[01:19:46.520 --> 01:19:49.760]   - This is now seven, eight, nine quarters in a row
[01:19:49.760 --> 01:19:52.360]   of profitability.
[01:19:52.360 --> 01:19:55.520]   After years and years and years of being criticized
[01:19:55.520 --> 01:19:59.720]   as a company that was just always plowing
[01:19:59.720 --> 01:20:02.680]   whatever profits it made back into the business,
[01:20:02.680 --> 01:20:05.440]   investing in infrastructure, and investing
[01:20:05.440 --> 01:20:09.760]   in what turned out to become AWS.
[01:20:09.760 --> 01:20:13.880]   But nobody really sort of grocked that at the time.
[01:20:13.880 --> 01:20:17.600]   But after all those years, they're now delivering
[01:20:17.600 --> 01:20:20.600]   a steady profit every single quarter.
[01:20:20.600 --> 01:20:25.600]   - AWS 46% sales increase, total revenue up 29%.
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:32.000]   Net income up 10 times 1,000% year over year,
[01:20:32.000 --> 01:20:36.600]   a record high $2.8 billion.
[01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:39.120]   But the market said you didn't meet expectations.
[01:20:39.120 --> 01:20:41.320]   - They managed profitability so carefully.
[01:20:41.320 --> 01:20:43.440]   - Yeah, anyway, interesting.
[01:20:43.440 --> 01:20:47.240]   - And remember 10% of the cloud of enterprises
[01:20:47.240 --> 01:20:48.880]   are all cloud today.
[01:20:48.880 --> 01:20:51.280]   It's gonna be 80% by 2025.
[01:20:51.280 --> 01:20:52.520]   - It's probably gonna grow.
[01:20:52.520 --> 01:20:54.400]   - Where's Amazon gonna be by then, right?
[01:20:54.400 --> 01:20:57.800]   It's gonna be the biggest company in the world by far.
[01:20:57.800 --> 01:21:02.560]   - Let's take a little break at Bot.
[01:21:02.560 --> 01:21:05.680]   Jason Heiner, Renee Ritchie,
[01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:07.000]   always a pleasure to have you guys.
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:11.040]   Bot Heiner and Ritchie sounds like a murderous row
[01:21:11.040 --> 01:21:13.440]   from the 1927 Yankees.
[01:21:13.440 --> 01:21:14.920]   Bot to Heiner to Ritchie.
[01:21:14.920 --> 01:21:19.320]   We had a great week this week
[01:21:19.320 --> 01:21:21.080]   and we have made a little video for your--
[01:21:21.080 --> 01:21:21.920]   - Seriously, enjoy it.
[01:21:21.920 --> 01:21:22.880]   - On Twitch.
[01:21:22.880 --> 01:21:25.440]   - How about a new course to teach people
[01:21:25.440 --> 01:21:27.520]   about fairness and machine learning?
[01:21:27.520 --> 01:21:28.840]   So what do you see?
[01:21:28.840 --> 01:21:33.240]   Bananas, stickers, or bananas on shelves.
[01:21:33.240 --> 01:21:35.080]   Students who complete this training will learn
[01:21:35.080 --> 01:21:37.040]   how biases might affect this,
[01:21:37.040 --> 01:21:38.800]   but in many parts of the world,
[01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:40.960]   yellow is not a common color for banana.
[01:21:40.960 --> 01:21:43.000]   They're pink.
[01:21:43.000 --> 01:21:43.840]   - What?
[01:21:43.840 --> 01:21:44.680]   - They're green.
[01:21:44.680 --> 01:21:45.520]   - They're green.
[01:21:45.520 --> 01:21:46.600]   - They're green.
[01:21:46.600 --> 01:21:48.080]   - The new screen sabers.
[01:21:48.080 --> 01:21:49.960]   - This is the iPhone XR.
[01:21:49.960 --> 01:21:52.400]   What's good about this is the price.
[01:21:52.400 --> 01:21:54.120]   They started $750.
[01:21:54.120 --> 01:21:58.000]   That's about a $250 less than the 10S Max.
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:59.840]   I am very, very happy with this
[01:21:59.840 --> 01:22:02.120]   and I think given the $750 price point,
[01:22:02.120 --> 01:22:04.000]   I think this is gonna be the iPhone this year
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.320]   for this year that people will really want.
[01:22:06.320 --> 01:22:07.160]   - Thank you, right.
[01:22:07.160 --> 01:22:08.000]   - Save a little bit of money.
[01:22:08.000 --> 01:22:09.040]   10 News weekly.
[01:22:09.040 --> 01:22:13.200]   - What is scarier, robots or wasps?
[01:22:13.200 --> 01:22:14.040]   - Wasps.
[01:22:14.040 --> 01:22:15.200]   - Have you been signed by a wasp?
[01:22:15.200 --> 01:22:17.240]   - Oh, I've got wasps stories.
[01:22:17.240 --> 01:22:18.520]   - Interesting.
[01:22:18.520 --> 01:22:20.440]   Robotics researchers have built robots
[01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:22.440]   that can fit in the palm of your hand,
[01:22:22.440 --> 01:22:23.440]   much like a wasp,
[01:22:23.440 --> 01:22:27.040]   but can also anchor themselves to the ground or to walls.
[01:22:27.040 --> 01:22:28.880]   And these are called mabs.
[01:22:28.880 --> 01:22:31.920]   And they could be especially helpful in disaster zones
[01:22:31.920 --> 01:22:33.440]   and also in my nightmares.
[01:22:33.440 --> 01:22:34.960]   - Yeah, come on little drone.
[01:22:34.960 --> 01:22:36.200]   Yeah, there you are.
[01:22:36.200 --> 01:22:37.240]   You're welcome.
[01:22:37.240 --> 01:22:38.080]   See you later.
[01:22:38.080 --> 01:22:38.920]   - Yes.
[01:22:38.920 --> 01:22:39.760]   - The bathrooms are on the corner.
[01:22:39.760 --> 01:22:40.600]   - Twit.
[01:22:40.600 --> 01:22:44.840]   It keeps going and going and going.
[01:22:44.840 --> 01:22:46.640]   - Did the wasps fly up your nose?
[01:22:46.640 --> 01:22:49.720]   - No, it trapped me at the top of a fort when I was a kid.
[01:22:49.720 --> 01:22:51.440]   There were like five of them and they stung me
[01:22:51.440 --> 01:22:52.760]   and I had to jump out of the fort.
[01:22:52.760 --> 01:22:54.040]   It was really frightening.
[01:22:54.040 --> 01:22:56.240]   It's a story I tell my kids to this day.
[01:22:56.240 --> 01:22:57.600]   It's not delightful.
[01:22:57.600 --> 01:23:01.280]   - Poor Jason.
[01:23:01.280 --> 01:23:04.360]   - Our show today brought to you by Betterment,
[01:23:04.360 --> 01:23:06.880]   a better way, the smart way to manage your money.
[01:23:06.880 --> 01:23:10.000]   Betterment is the largest independent online financial
[01:23:10.000 --> 01:23:13.160]   advisor designed to help customers build wealth,
[01:23:13.160 --> 01:23:17.040]   plan for retirement and achieve their financial goals.
[01:23:17.040 --> 01:23:19.360]   If you are saving and you should be saving,
[01:23:19.360 --> 01:23:23.880]   whether it's for college or for a house or for retirement,
[01:23:23.880 --> 01:23:25.160]   you've got to put your money somewhere.
[01:23:25.160 --> 01:23:28.280]   You can't put it in a savings account these days.
[01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:30.080]   That's not going to go anywhere.
[01:23:30.080 --> 01:23:31.480]   So how do you invest?
[01:23:31.480 --> 01:23:33.320]   I think a lot of geeks, a lot of us say,
[01:23:33.320 --> 01:23:35.320]   oh, we can do it ourselves and then put the money somewhere
[01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:36.800]   and just forget about it for years
[01:23:36.800 --> 01:23:38.240]   and you don't know what's happening.
[01:23:38.240 --> 01:23:39.840]   This has been a tough year in the market.
[01:23:39.840 --> 01:23:41.960]   That's why you need a little help.
[01:23:41.960 --> 01:23:43.880]   You need Betterment.
[01:23:43.880 --> 01:23:48.120]   Betterment uses technology to help you make more
[01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:49.400]   from your investments.
[01:23:49.400 --> 01:23:51.920]   And actually you can really take advantage of Betterment
[01:23:51.920 --> 01:23:55.680]   when the market's down because they can do then tax loss
[01:23:55.680 --> 01:23:59.800]   harvesting and give you a tax benefit
[01:23:59.800 --> 01:24:01.800]   that kind of offsets the losses.
[01:24:01.800 --> 01:24:02.620]   It's things like that.
[01:24:02.620 --> 01:24:06.360]   They're trading instantaneously on your behalf.
[01:24:06.360 --> 01:24:07.440]   There are no hidden costs.
[01:24:07.440 --> 01:24:10.400]   You pay a low transparent management fee
[01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:12.200]   and the transactions are,
[01:24:12.200 --> 01:24:13.880]   you do not get charged for transactions.
[01:24:13.880 --> 01:24:16.760]   They do that all within the fee.
[01:24:16.760 --> 01:24:17.720]   They're a fiduciary.
[01:24:17.720 --> 01:24:19.280]   This is really important.
[01:24:19.280 --> 01:24:22.000]   In fact, you should ask anybody who gives you advice.
[01:24:22.000 --> 01:24:23.560]   Are you a fiduciary?
[01:24:23.560 --> 01:24:25.960]   They make recommendations in your best interest.
[01:24:25.960 --> 01:24:28.760]   They are not incentivized to recommend certain funds.
[01:24:28.760 --> 01:24:31.800]   They don't have their own investment products to sell,
[01:24:31.800 --> 01:24:34.480]   but you do get unlimited expert device
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:36.760]   that's tailored to you exactly.
[01:24:36.760 --> 01:24:40.040]   Betterment gives you constant access to information
[01:24:40.040 --> 01:24:43.360]   and tools that allow you to track progress towards your goals.
[01:24:43.360 --> 01:24:45.320]   You'll feel smart, you will,
[01:24:45.320 --> 01:24:48.520]   and you can take advantage of down markets and up markets.
[01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:49.840]   Investing involves risks.
[01:24:49.840 --> 01:24:51.040]   I'm not saying it doesn't,
[01:24:51.040 --> 01:24:53.400]   but our listeners can get up to one year managed free
[01:24:53.400 --> 01:25:05.840]   right now if you go to betterment.com/twitbetterment.com/twitbetterment.com/twitbettermentoutsmartaverage.
[01:25:12.400 --> 01:25:15.560]   I did a bad couple of weeks for Microsoft.
[01:25:15.560 --> 01:25:17.200]   (laughs)
[01:25:17.200 --> 01:25:23.400]   Windows 10 1809.
[01:25:23.400 --> 01:25:25.200]   I don't even know what to say.
[01:25:25.200 --> 01:25:28.280]   There is no question that the worst kind of bug
[01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:30.000]   you can have in an operating system
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:34.000]   is one that deletes data by accident.
[01:25:34.000 --> 01:25:35.200]   That's what's happened to Microsoft.
[01:25:35.200 --> 01:25:38.840]   Not once, but twice now.
[01:25:38.840 --> 01:25:40.960]   And here's Ed Bot writing about it.
[01:25:40.960 --> 01:25:43.280]   He says, "Worst Windows 10 version ever?
[01:25:43.280 --> 01:25:48.760]   "Microsoft's terrible, horrible, no good, very bad, October."
[01:25:48.760 --> 01:25:51.360]   A lot of people are speculating why this is happening.
[01:25:51.360 --> 01:25:52.840]   Ed, do you have an opinion on this?
[01:25:52.840 --> 01:25:56.280]   Is this have something to do with the way Microsoft develops Windows?
[01:25:56.280 --> 01:26:03.200]   I don't think that was, Peter Bright wrote a really good article
[01:26:03.200 --> 01:26:04.760]   on our technical about this.
[01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:07.080]   And everyone should read that.
[01:26:08.720 --> 01:26:11.320]   It's long and it's technical,
[01:26:11.320 --> 01:26:14.240]   but I think he gets at a few points.
[01:26:14.240 --> 01:26:16.360]   - His premise is that when you did a new version
[01:26:16.360 --> 01:26:17.480]   of Windows every three years,
[01:26:17.480 --> 01:26:20.000]   you could do it in a kind of a waterfall method
[01:26:20.000 --> 01:26:23.240]   that really involved planning a short period
[01:26:23.240 --> 01:26:27.720]   of development, testing and release,
[01:26:27.720 --> 01:26:29.120]   but that it's not working as well
[01:26:29.120 --> 01:26:33.440]   in the shorter time frames of the dual yearly releases.
[01:26:33.440 --> 01:26:38.320]   And Microsoft fired all the professional testers
[01:26:38.320 --> 01:26:40.920]   and basically is relied, it seems,
[01:26:40.920 --> 01:26:43.640]   on the Windows Insiders program,
[01:26:43.640 --> 01:26:45.000]   which is you're getting people
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:46.760]   who are not professional testers.
[01:26:46.760 --> 01:26:48.560]   And so the testing has been somewhat helpful.
[01:26:48.560 --> 01:26:50.920]   - It's slightly more complicated than that.
[01:26:50.920 --> 01:26:56.000]   And so my thesis in this article is,
[01:26:56.000 --> 01:26:58.840]   there's a great management principle,
[01:26:58.840 --> 01:27:03.000]   really important management principle.
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:05.840]   What gets measured gets done, right?
[01:27:05.840 --> 01:27:09.960]   And what Microsoft has done with Windows 10,
[01:27:09.960 --> 01:27:12.080]   and they caught a lot of flak
[01:27:12.080 --> 01:27:18.960]   unjustifiably, in my opinion, on privacy issues
[01:27:18.960 --> 01:27:24.080]   because of all the monitoring diagnostic feedback technology
[01:27:24.080 --> 01:27:26.000]   that they built into Windows 10.
[01:27:26.000 --> 01:27:28.680]   What that's given them is the ability to look
[01:27:28.680 --> 01:27:33.560]   in real time at these dashboards as software is installed,
[01:27:33.560 --> 01:27:36.440]   as drivers are installed, as people use the product,
[01:27:36.440 --> 01:27:39.280]   as they open the start menu and--
[01:27:39.280 --> 01:27:40.880]   - Microsoft calls it telemetry.
[01:27:40.880 --> 01:27:42.640]   And in fact, that's that stuff that's
[01:27:42.640 --> 01:27:45.120]   sending back to the home office all the time, right?
[01:27:45.120 --> 01:27:50.080]   - And so they have become so obsessed with telemetry
[01:27:50.080 --> 01:27:52.880]   that that has become the metric
[01:27:52.880 --> 01:27:54.160]   that they use for everything.
[01:27:54.160 --> 01:27:57.920]   And so when they see a problem, they say,
[01:27:57.920 --> 01:28:00.680]   well, on our telemetry dashboards,
[01:28:00.680 --> 01:28:05.440]   we see that blue screens are down 35%,
[01:28:05.440 --> 01:28:07.800]   and driver problems are down 17%,
[01:28:07.800 --> 01:28:11.160]   and the start menu is opening 17 seconds faster,
[01:28:11.160 --> 01:28:15.280]   17% faster, and so on and so on.
[01:28:15.280 --> 01:28:18.280]   The trouble is that the problems
[01:28:18.280 --> 01:28:20.400]   that they've been encountering throughout the month
[01:28:20.400 --> 01:28:23.480]   of October, and there are a few other ones here as well,
[01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:26.120]   are the kind of things that you're not going to see
[01:28:26.120 --> 01:28:27.480]   in telemetry.
[01:28:28.400 --> 01:28:31.720]   And they basically require--
[01:28:31.720 --> 01:28:36.120]   so let me see if I can very briefly explain
[01:28:36.120 --> 01:28:40.360]   the killer bug that caused them to pull the software
[01:28:40.360 --> 01:28:42.160]   four days after they released it,
[01:28:42.160 --> 01:28:43.960]   which is kind of unheard of.
[01:28:43.960 --> 01:28:50.720]   If you had relocated your documents and videos
[01:28:50.720 --> 01:28:52.840]   and music folders to a different drive,
[01:28:52.840 --> 01:28:55.840]   using the built-in feature, Windows 10,
[01:28:55.840 --> 01:28:58.640]   all versions of Windows for that.
[01:28:58.640 --> 01:29:01.400]   You said, I want this on the D drive instead of the C drive,
[01:29:01.400 --> 01:29:02.760]   and so you click that thing.
[01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:06.720]   But if you left the original folder on the C drive,
[01:29:06.720 --> 01:29:10.000]   the installer program said, oh, okay,
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:14.920]   we're, you know, you've relocated your personal files.
[01:29:14.920 --> 01:29:18.880]   And so therefore, anything that's in the original location
[01:29:18.880 --> 01:29:20.960]   is junk, and we're just going to get rid of it
[01:29:20.960 --> 01:29:23.440]   during the process of upgrading to this new version.
[01:29:23.440 --> 01:29:27.040]   And Ick, that's not the way that a lot of people
[01:29:27.040 --> 01:29:27.880]   had done this.
[01:29:27.880 --> 01:29:30.440]   They had files in two different places.
[01:29:30.440 --> 01:29:31.280]   That's the kind of thing.
[01:29:31.280 --> 01:29:34.640]   Telemetry is never going to tell you that that happened.
[01:29:34.640 --> 01:29:39.960]   And this was reported by bug testers,
[01:29:39.960 --> 01:29:44.960]   by amateurs, testers in the Windows Insider program.
[01:29:44.960 --> 01:29:47.680]   They had been reporting this sporadically
[01:29:47.680 --> 01:29:51.960]   for several months, but non-professionals
[01:29:51.960 --> 01:29:54.600]   don't write good bug reports.
[01:29:54.600 --> 01:29:59.600]   And so these things never rose to the level of urgency
[01:29:59.600 --> 01:30:02.880]   that an engineer needed to see them.
[01:30:02.880 --> 01:30:05.840]   And back to your point, Leo, yes,
[01:30:05.840 --> 01:30:10.320]   when they got rid of the dedicated testers,
[01:30:10.320 --> 01:30:12.640]   the things that dedicated testers do
[01:30:12.640 --> 01:30:17.040]   in a situation like this is they start testing edge cases.
[01:30:17.040 --> 01:30:20.400]   The developer says, well, I wrote this product
[01:30:20.400 --> 01:30:23.040]   to do this feature, and here's how it was designed,
[01:30:23.040 --> 01:30:24.720]   and it works as designed.
[01:30:24.720 --> 01:30:29.280]   And a good tester says, what happens if I do this?
[01:30:29.280 --> 01:30:30.800]   Why would you do that?
[01:30:30.800 --> 01:30:32.200]   I'm an end user.
[01:30:32.200 --> 01:30:34.240]   And you do crazy things.
[01:30:34.240 --> 01:30:38.400]   End users do off the wall things
[01:30:38.400 --> 01:30:42.080]   for whatever reason they have for doing those things.
[01:30:42.080 --> 01:30:46.120]   But that's my thesis of why this happened,
[01:30:46.120 --> 01:30:50.040]   is that they didn't have processes in place
[01:30:50.040 --> 01:30:53.280]   to effectively identify these kind of edge cases.
[01:30:53.280 --> 01:30:56.840]   So the bottom line is they do have,
[01:30:56.840 --> 01:31:01.840]   Windows 10 is, I think, verifiably more reliable
[01:31:01.840 --> 01:31:07.240]   and more performant than any previous version of Windows.
[01:31:07.240 --> 01:31:12.240]   And yet that is because of the system
[01:31:12.240 --> 01:31:15.720]   that they built that allowed some of these weirdo bugs
[01:31:15.720 --> 01:31:17.720]   to slip through, and they only affect
[01:31:17.720 --> 01:31:19.360]   a small number of people.
[01:31:19.360 --> 01:31:22.600]   But it really hurts if you're one of the people
[01:31:22.600 --> 01:31:23.880]   who got affected by this.
[01:31:23.880 --> 01:31:26.400]   Yeah, data deletion is pretty severe.
[01:31:26.400 --> 01:31:27.240]   Yeah.
[01:31:27.240 --> 01:31:30.520]   I mean, that is as bad as it gets.
[01:31:30.520 --> 01:31:32.640]   I guess the only thing worse is not running at all,
[01:31:32.640 --> 01:31:34.680]   but at least you don't lose your data.
[01:31:34.680 --> 01:31:36.000]   Right.
[01:31:36.000 --> 01:31:38.160]   All of the stuff is so complicated.
[01:31:38.160 --> 01:31:41.200]   It's complicated, but at the same time,
[01:31:41.200 --> 01:31:45.840]   it feels to me like we've gotten pretty good
[01:31:45.840 --> 01:31:49.320]   at software engineering and making reliable software,
[01:31:49.320 --> 01:31:51.920]   I know how complicated Windows is,
[01:31:51.920 --> 01:31:55.520]   but it seems to me it's a tooling problem.
[01:31:55.520 --> 01:31:57.640]   You don't fire your testers.
[01:31:57.640 --> 01:31:59.200]   That's nuts.
[01:31:59.200 --> 01:32:03.920]   You have tooling in a system that tests everything
[01:32:03.920 --> 01:32:07.440]   as you're going, not all, I think Brite's not far off
[01:32:07.440 --> 01:32:10.280]   when he says, waiting till you finish development
[01:32:10.280 --> 01:32:12.560]   to start testing is wrong.
[01:32:12.560 --> 01:32:14.880]   There's some simple things that I feel
[01:32:14.880 --> 01:32:16.080]   like Microsoft could work on,
[01:32:16.080 --> 01:32:21.080]   and adding this box to the insider program,
[01:32:21.080 --> 01:32:23.800]   how does this problem impact your experience?
[01:32:23.800 --> 01:32:24.800]   That's worthless.
[01:32:24.800 --> 01:32:28.080]   Every bug is severe if you use this box.
[01:32:28.080 --> 01:32:29.600]   It's just dopey.
[01:32:29.600 --> 01:32:30.440]   And that's the thing.
[01:32:30.440 --> 01:32:32.000]   Apple had a very bad month of its own
[01:32:32.000 --> 01:32:34.280]   when it had a bunch of really bad, like root exploits,
[01:32:34.280 --> 01:32:37.080]   and they had a bad year and they realized
[01:32:37.080 --> 01:32:38.360]   that they were doing similar to what Ed said.
[01:32:38.360 --> 01:32:40.840]   They were testing for, you know, crashes are way down
[01:32:40.840 --> 01:32:42.480]   and these apps are launching faster,
[01:32:42.480 --> 01:32:44.600]   but it turned out a lot of people found frustrators
[01:32:44.600 --> 01:32:47.000]   in volume just as bad as crashes,
[01:32:47.000 --> 01:32:48.760]   and they didn't really have metrics on that.
[01:32:48.760 --> 01:32:51.400]   And that's what led to a lot of the performance-based
[01:32:51.400 --> 01:32:53.040]   rewrites that we've gotten this year.
[01:32:53.040 --> 01:32:54.920]   And I always think like really bad things are gonna happen.
[01:32:54.920 --> 01:32:57.440]   Yes, you know, they made a mistake with the testers.
[01:32:57.440 --> 01:32:59.160]   So for me, it's always how a company responds
[01:32:59.160 --> 01:33:00.000]   to those things.
[01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:01.320]   There are companies that respond terribly
[01:33:01.320 --> 01:33:02.400]   to these kinds of things,
[01:33:02.400 --> 01:33:04.560]   and companies that respond really well to them.
[01:33:04.560 --> 01:33:07.560]   And Microsoft, when you say like a few percentage of users,
[01:33:07.560 --> 01:33:09.640]   when you're at Apple or Microsoft or Google scale,
[01:33:09.640 --> 01:33:11.000]   that's still hundreds of thousands,
[01:33:11.000 --> 01:33:11.840]   if not millions of people.
[01:33:11.840 --> 01:33:16.840]   Microsoft said only 1%, 1/100 of 1% of users experienced it,
[01:33:16.840 --> 01:33:18.280]   but that's 1,500 people who lost it.
[01:33:18.280 --> 01:33:19.920]   At window scale, yeah.
[01:33:19.920 --> 01:33:20.760]   Right, yeah.
[01:33:20.760 --> 01:33:23.160]   And you know, it's just a lot of it goes back to,
[01:33:23.160 --> 01:33:26.760]   you know, the desktop is, and, you know,
[01:33:26.760 --> 01:33:31.000]   computers are not flashy, it's not a growth market.
[01:33:31.000 --> 01:33:34.080]   And so these companies are managing them for profit, right?
[01:33:34.080 --> 01:33:36.320]   They're putting fewer and fewer resources,
[01:33:36.320 --> 01:33:40.240]   the minimal resources they can possibly put against it,
[01:33:40.240 --> 01:33:41.080]   that they can.
[01:33:41.080 --> 01:33:43.760]   And we've seen it with Mac, we've seen it with Windows.
[01:33:43.760 --> 01:33:48.760]   I was at Microsoft campus last year,
[01:33:48.760 --> 01:33:53.440]   and I was amazed, I was there for three days,
[01:33:53.440 --> 01:33:55.960]   I didn't hear the word Windows one time.
[01:33:55.960 --> 01:33:56.800]   Yeah.
[01:33:56.800 --> 01:33:59.200]   It's like Google not saying the word Android
[01:33:59.200 --> 01:34:00.520]   in its product and that.
[01:34:00.520 --> 01:34:01.760]   They're like, they're not off to college
[01:34:01.760 --> 01:34:03.200]   and have kids in a settle down, you know,
[01:34:03.200 --> 01:34:05.280]   they don't give them attention that they used to.
[01:34:05.280 --> 01:34:06.480]   Well, I think there's more than that.
[01:34:06.480 --> 01:34:08.000]   I think Mary Jo Foley referred to this.
[01:34:08.000 --> 01:34:09.320]   I think they don't want to be thought of
[01:34:09.320 --> 01:34:11.080]   as a Windows company as much.
[01:34:11.080 --> 01:34:11.920]   They definitely want to.
[01:34:11.920 --> 01:34:14.760]   Oh, they've, and they've removed Windows
[01:34:14.760 --> 01:34:17.880]   from the branding of a lot of their corporate,
[01:34:17.880 --> 01:34:21.080]   it used to be Windows Azure, now it's Microsoft Azure.
[01:34:21.080 --> 01:34:25.320]   You know, and that's deliberate.
[01:34:25.320 --> 01:34:27.560]   They want to be going, you know,
[01:34:27.560 --> 01:34:29.360]   they want that branding to be there
[01:34:29.360 --> 01:34:33.560]   because Windows is a, is a shrinking part
[01:34:33.560 --> 01:34:37.760]   of the larger population of devices,
[01:34:37.760 --> 01:34:39.760]   especially mobile devices in there.
[01:34:39.760 --> 01:34:44.160]   But I think there's a second problem as well.
[01:34:44.160 --> 01:34:46.560]   I called it out in a different column
[01:34:46.560 --> 01:34:50.080]   where I said, I think two feature updates a year
[01:34:50.080 --> 01:34:52.280]   is too many, two updates a year is too many.
[01:34:52.280 --> 01:34:56.480]   And here's the problem.
[01:34:56.480 --> 01:34:59.360]   Every time you do an update,
[01:34:59.360 --> 01:35:02.040]   whether it's to your iPhone or your Android
[01:35:02.040 --> 01:35:04.360]   or your Windows PC or your Mac,
[01:35:04.360 --> 01:35:07.280]   every time you do a major upgrade there,
[01:35:07.280 --> 01:35:12.280]   no matter how conscientious the developers have designed it
[01:35:12.280 --> 01:35:15.040]   and how well they have tested it,
[01:35:15.040 --> 01:35:17.960]   you have, you're changing the state
[01:35:17.960 --> 01:35:21.520]   of a whole bunch of parts of the device
[01:35:21.520 --> 01:35:23.680]   and you're introducing the opportunity
[01:35:23.680 --> 01:35:25.000]   for something to go wrong.
[01:35:25.000 --> 01:35:27.080]   And the thing that could go wrong
[01:35:27.080 --> 01:35:29.560]   could be someone else's fault.
[01:35:29.560 --> 01:35:32.640]   It's a driver from a third party company
[01:35:32.640 --> 01:35:35.960]   or it's a defective piece of hardware or whatever.
[01:35:35.960 --> 01:35:39.360]   But when you're doing that every six months,
[01:35:39.360 --> 01:35:42.480]   when you're doing this big refresh,
[01:35:42.480 --> 01:35:44.560]   you're just introducing an opportunity
[01:35:44.560 --> 01:35:49.080]   for bad things to happen, even if they're not your fault.
[01:35:49.080 --> 01:35:52.760]   And if my PC breaks,
[01:35:52.760 --> 01:35:57.760]   if my iPhone breaks because you gave me an update,
[01:35:57.760 --> 01:36:00.760]   I'm gonna call you and when you tell me,
[01:36:00.760 --> 01:36:02.680]   well, it's not our fault,
[01:36:02.680 --> 01:36:07.680]   I'm not gonna accept that.
[01:36:07.680 --> 01:36:10.880]   - Both Mac, it was working.
[01:36:10.880 --> 01:36:13.560]   - You know, both Mac and Windows,
[01:36:13.560 --> 01:36:16.480]   and look, as a publication,
[01:36:16.480 --> 01:36:18.320]   we love when they do new versions
[01:36:18.320 --> 01:36:21.520]   because people wanna know what are the new features.
[01:36:21.520 --> 01:36:23.280]   And it is, it's something to talk about
[01:36:23.280 --> 01:36:26.240]   and it's interesting, but from a user standpoint,
[01:36:26.240 --> 01:36:30.080]   it's really out of date.
[01:36:30.080 --> 01:36:32.320]   What about, think about Chromebook, right?
[01:36:32.320 --> 01:36:35.640]   That's much more, there's much less to change with Chromebooks,
[01:36:35.640 --> 01:36:39.240]   let's be honest, but when do they announce,
[01:36:39.240 --> 01:36:42.880]   oh yeah, a new version of Chrome OS is gonna be released.
[01:36:42.880 --> 01:36:44.360]   Never, they never talk about it.
[01:36:44.360 --> 01:36:46.320]   You just restart the thing once in a while
[01:36:46.320 --> 01:36:49.520]   and it automatically has some new features.
[01:36:49.520 --> 01:36:51.680]   And sometimes I talk a little bit about the new features,
[01:36:51.680 --> 01:36:55.400]   but really that's more the future model
[01:36:55.400 --> 01:36:57.280]   of where this stuff is gonna go
[01:36:57.280 --> 01:36:58.400]   and it makes a lot more sense.
[01:36:58.400 --> 01:37:00.080]   We see it in our own site.
[01:37:00.080 --> 01:37:02.040]   We used to do these big redesigns
[01:37:02.040 --> 01:37:04.880]   and inevitably every time we did a redesign,
[01:37:04.880 --> 01:37:07.480]   we would lose at least like 5% of our users
[01:37:07.480 --> 01:37:09.440]   'cause they'd be like, you moved something
[01:37:09.440 --> 01:37:12.240]   and I can't find it or something would break.
[01:37:12.240 --> 01:37:14.920]   And finally, I just was like,
[01:37:14.920 --> 01:37:16.560]   we're not doing any more redesigns.
[01:37:16.560 --> 01:37:19.080]   We're just gonna incrementally add and get better.
[01:37:19.080 --> 01:37:20.880]   And when there's big features, we'll announce it
[01:37:20.880 --> 01:37:21.880]   and we'll let people know.
[01:37:21.880 --> 01:37:24.040]   We gave you something new or whatever.
[01:37:24.040 --> 01:37:26.160]   And it works so much better
[01:37:26.160 --> 01:37:27.920]   and we don't have these big moments
[01:37:27.920 --> 01:37:29.480]   where we moved somebody's cheese
[01:37:29.480 --> 01:37:32.080]   or we broke something that was really important to them.
[01:37:32.080 --> 01:37:35.160]   We rarely rarely rarely ever have those kinds of things
[01:37:35.160 --> 01:37:37.160]   anymore because we just go incrementally.
[01:37:37.160 --> 01:37:39.640]   - Can we be better off if one of these companies
[01:37:39.640 --> 01:37:41.760]   just said, let's start over.
[01:37:41.760 --> 01:37:43.880]   Let's rewrite this from scratch.
[01:37:43.880 --> 01:37:45.400]   - Me, Modern Fuchsia.
[01:37:45.400 --> 01:37:47.880]   - Well, maybe that's what Google's doing with Fuchsia,
[01:37:47.880 --> 01:37:49.880]   but maybe Microsoft or Apple.
[01:37:49.880 --> 01:37:52.240]   Let's start over, let's write this in a modern language,
[01:37:52.240 --> 01:37:56.560]   a type safe language with good testing tools
[01:37:56.560 --> 01:37:58.160]   and maybe do it right.
[01:37:58.160 --> 01:38:00.840]   - It's really hard because like they did,
[01:38:00.840 --> 01:38:03.320]   OS 10 was a huge transition for Apple
[01:38:03.320 --> 01:38:04.920]   and it was a painful transition.
[01:38:04.920 --> 01:38:07.920]   And I don't think they want to or they can just go buy
[01:38:07.920 --> 01:38:09.600]   another next, there's no next next.
[01:38:09.600 --> 01:38:11.160]   So what they're doing is bit by bit,
[01:38:11.160 --> 01:38:12.800]   year after year, they're rewriting launch D,
[01:38:12.800 --> 01:38:15.160]   they're changing the file system, they went to Swift.
[01:38:15.160 --> 01:38:16.360]   And even those are incredibly painful.
[01:38:16.360 --> 01:38:18.320]   - Yeah, but that's changing the engine of a plane in flight.
[01:38:18.320 --> 01:38:20.320]   It's a very hard thing to do.
[01:38:20.320 --> 01:38:22.000]   - And almost everything we've been complaining about
[01:38:22.000 --> 01:38:23.640]   in terms of performance and bugs and stuff
[01:38:23.640 --> 01:38:25.280]   as a result of changing massive amounts
[01:38:25.280 --> 01:38:26.520]   of internal infrastructure.
[01:38:26.520 --> 01:38:27.520]   - Right, yeah.
[01:38:27.520 --> 01:38:32.160]   And the other thing about the introduction of OS 10
[01:38:32.160 --> 01:38:34.960]   was that Apple was a company in trouble.
[01:38:34.960 --> 01:38:38.320]   They didn't have a lot to lose at that point.
[01:38:38.320 --> 01:38:39.160]   - Right.
[01:38:39.160 --> 01:38:41.440]   - And in fact, they were about to go out of business.
[01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:43.960]   They were inches away from going out of business.
[01:38:43.960 --> 01:38:45.800]   - Yeah, yeah, there were, yeah,
[01:38:45.800 --> 01:38:50.280]   there's some historical debate about how close they were
[01:38:50.280 --> 01:38:54.880]   to that, but basically it was an unsustainable,
[01:38:54.880 --> 01:38:57.400]   an unsustainable path that they were on.
[01:38:57.400 --> 01:39:01.480]   And so having Steve Jobs buy next
[01:39:01.480 --> 01:39:05.760]   and then bringing him and next back into the company
[01:39:05.760 --> 01:39:10.520]   and turning next into OS 10 was,
[01:39:10.520 --> 01:39:14.960]   it wasn't disrupt yourself before someone else does.
[01:39:14.960 --> 01:39:19.960]   It was disrupt ourselves because the OS 9 is not the future.
[01:39:19.960 --> 01:39:24.560]   - No, it wasn't, yeah.
[01:39:24.560 --> 01:39:28.920]   - Will we be still using Windows and Mac OS and Linux
[01:39:28.920 --> 01:39:32.560]   and iOS and Android a hundred years from now?
[01:39:32.560 --> 01:39:33.840]   No.
[01:39:33.840 --> 01:39:34.920]   - Well, Red Hat Leo.
[01:39:34.920 --> 01:39:36.120]   - We'll be using Red Hat.
[01:39:36.120 --> 01:39:39.080]   (both laughing)
[01:39:39.080 --> 01:39:41.160]   - But seriously, I mean, are we done?
[01:39:41.160 --> 01:39:42.000]   Is this it?
[01:39:42.000 --> 01:39:43.200]   These are the operating systems.
[01:39:43.200 --> 01:39:44.800]   Good luck, have fun.
[01:39:44.800 --> 01:39:46.040]   - It's a cybernetic operation.
[01:39:46.040 --> 01:39:47.800]   Whatever they're gonna plug into our brains eventually,
[01:39:47.800 --> 01:39:49.920]   they will live in some joint consciousness.
[01:39:49.920 --> 01:39:50.760]   - At least.
[01:39:50.760 --> 01:39:53.280]   - I think we're not gonna, in 25 years,
[01:39:53.280 --> 01:39:54.640]   I don't think we're gonna just be talking
[01:39:54.640 --> 01:39:56.320]   about operating systems anymore.
[01:39:56.320 --> 01:39:58.720]   I think that it won't matter.
[01:39:58.720 --> 01:40:00.320]   I think some of it,
[01:40:00.320 --> 01:40:04.000]   it will be, there will be layers in between,
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.960]   operating systems that will unify things.
[01:40:06.960 --> 01:40:09.800]   You're already seeing that in the cloud world where,
[01:40:09.800 --> 01:40:13.480]   you actually, your infrastructure works on both Amazon
[01:40:13.480 --> 01:40:16.040]   and runs on both Amazon and Azure,
[01:40:16.040 --> 01:40:18.040]   sometimes also Google too.
[01:40:18.040 --> 01:40:20.920]   But you have a layer above that where,
[01:40:20.920 --> 01:40:23.600]   essentially functionally, things are running on.
[01:40:23.600 --> 01:40:25.080]   And to the user, it doesn't matter.
[01:40:25.080 --> 01:40:27.960]   And I think the operating systems are gonna be that way.
[01:40:27.960 --> 01:40:30.320]   It's gonna fade further and further into the background.
[01:40:30.320 --> 01:40:33.440]   And that's one of the reasons the companies aren't,
[01:40:33.440 --> 01:40:36.480]   they don't pay a lot of lip service to them anymore.
[01:40:36.480 --> 01:40:39.680]   I think they would like them to move more
[01:40:39.680 --> 01:40:40.520]   into the background.
[01:40:40.520 --> 01:40:43.760]   I think even within a decade, it's possible.
[01:40:43.760 --> 01:40:46.160]   Maybe even five, within five to 10 years,
[01:40:46.160 --> 01:40:50.880]   I think you'll see Windows and Mac both go more
[01:40:50.880 --> 01:40:54.160]   into the Chrome OS model of these sort of incremental updates.
[01:40:54.160 --> 01:40:57.440]   The funny thing is, Microsoft intellectually,
[01:40:57.440 --> 01:40:59.800]   or at least conceptually, was there
[01:40:59.800 --> 01:41:01.840]   when they announced Windows XP, right?
[01:41:01.840 --> 01:41:04.680]   Because the Windows XP, the original launch,
[01:41:04.680 --> 01:41:07.920]   the original pitch of Windows XP is,
[01:41:07.920 --> 01:41:09.960]   we're gonna get out of the operating system business.
[01:41:09.960 --> 01:41:12.400]   We're gonna, you're gonna buy this,
[01:41:12.400 --> 01:41:15.080]   you know, you'll buy it sort of a subscription
[01:41:15.080 --> 01:41:17.880]   and we'll give you updates continually.
[01:41:17.880 --> 01:41:20.360]   And we're gonna stop with these big releases.
[01:41:20.360 --> 01:41:22.160]   That was in 2001.
[01:41:22.160 --> 01:41:24.200]   But there was such a backlash from the people
[01:41:24.200 --> 01:41:26.160]   who still loved and thought of their computer
[01:41:26.160 --> 01:41:27.640]   as the operating system,
[01:41:27.640 --> 01:41:29.600]   that they had to backpedal from that.
[01:41:29.600 --> 01:41:31.280]   And eventually they kind of threw up their arms.
[01:41:31.280 --> 01:41:34.720]   But, you know, this idea has been around for a long time.
[01:41:34.720 --> 01:41:36.520]   And I think we're just sort of at the end
[01:41:36.520 --> 01:41:39.840]   of the cycle for the operating system.
[01:41:39.840 --> 01:41:42.440]   And it's days aren't, you know,
[01:41:42.440 --> 01:41:45.040]   in terms of being a thing that we think about
[01:41:45.040 --> 01:41:47.920]   and talk about and it's part of what we think about
[01:41:47.920 --> 01:41:48.760]   from computers.
[01:41:48.760 --> 01:41:50.160]   Now there's gonna be still new features.
[01:41:50.160 --> 01:41:52.440]   And we're gonna be talking about new features
[01:41:52.440 --> 01:41:54.720]   that are introduced just in the same way we do
[01:41:54.720 --> 01:41:56.920]   in the app world and iOS world.
[01:41:56.920 --> 01:41:59.440]   And when there's new and Android world,
[01:41:59.440 --> 01:42:01.240]   when there are new things that are announced
[01:42:01.240 --> 01:42:04.360]   and like Google Maps has, you know, done this year
[01:42:04.360 --> 01:42:06.680]   an amazing amount of new features, right?
[01:42:06.680 --> 01:42:08.720]   And every time there's a new feature,
[01:42:08.720 --> 01:42:10.680]   it just kind of will slowly, you know,
[01:42:10.680 --> 01:42:12.640]   trickle it out to a certain number of users.
[01:42:12.640 --> 01:42:14.360]   And then somebody gets wind of it
[01:42:14.360 --> 01:42:16.680]   and they start talking about it, you know,
[01:42:16.680 --> 01:42:18.560]   because they were part of the A/B test
[01:42:18.560 --> 01:42:22.320]   where it went out to whatever 10%, 20% of users.
[01:42:22.320 --> 01:42:24.000]   We're gonna still be talking about features
[01:42:24.000 --> 01:42:26.720]   but we're not gonna be talking about these big OS upgrades.
[01:42:26.720 --> 01:42:28.800]   I think the days are definitely numbered.
[01:42:28.800 --> 01:42:31.760]   - Although if you'd asked me 10 years ago
[01:42:31.760 --> 01:42:35.680]   if IBM would acquire Red Hat for $32 billion,
[01:42:35.680 --> 01:42:37.240]   I would have said no.
[01:42:37.240 --> 01:42:38.840]   - Would you have thought that people would be walking around
[01:42:38.840 --> 01:42:40.680]   with Linux boxes in their pocket right at the conqueror?
[01:42:40.680 --> 01:42:41.520]   - I mean, come on.
[01:42:41.520 --> 01:42:44.320]   We thought the Vatican would have created a Pokemon Go
[01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:45.720]   where you catch saints?
[01:42:45.720 --> 01:42:46.400]   - No, no. - No.
[01:42:46.400 --> 01:42:47.800]   - So, no.
[01:42:47.800 --> 01:42:49.240]   - It's gonna be a wee chat at West Leo.
[01:42:49.240 --> 01:42:50.080]   We all know that. - In fact,
[01:42:50.080 --> 01:42:51.440]   if you'd asked me 10 years ago,
[01:42:51.440 --> 01:42:53.400]   would you go around spinning little balls
[01:42:53.400 --> 01:42:56.600]   to throw a pocket monster into visible gyms?
[01:42:56.600 --> 01:42:57.560]   What is the story here?
[01:42:57.560 --> 01:42:58.920]   Is this a made up story?
[01:42:58.920 --> 01:42:59.920]   Is this a joke site?
[01:42:59.920 --> 01:43:00.960]   - No, no, no.
[01:43:00.960 --> 01:43:01.880]   This is a real story.
[01:43:01.880 --> 01:43:03.840]   - We reported it.
[01:43:03.840 --> 01:43:04.680]   We reported it.
[01:43:04.680 --> 01:43:06.120]   It's only in sp--
[01:43:06.120 --> 01:43:08.800]   So the app is only in Spanish right now.
[01:43:08.800 --> 01:43:14.160]   - It's called JC Go, not Pokemon Go.
[01:43:14.160 --> 01:43:15.000]   - Right. - The next rate
[01:43:15.000 --> 01:43:16.400]   for the Pope is such weird.
[01:43:16.400 --> 01:43:20.040]   - It's, the Vatican has essentially, you know,
[01:43:20.040 --> 01:43:21.680]   given it the blessing.
[01:43:21.680 --> 01:43:24.680]   - Is it using the Niantic software or is it--
[01:43:24.680 --> 01:43:25.520]   - No. - Somebody else
[01:43:25.520 --> 01:43:27.200]   is Google Open Source one?
[01:43:27.200 --> 01:43:28.920]   - Oh, maybe. - If somebody else,
[01:43:28.920 --> 01:43:33.000]   you have to memorize like verses and identify.
[01:43:33.000 --> 01:43:36.560]   I only know this because on download.com,
[01:43:36.560 --> 01:43:40.840]   we covered it as well on cnet download.com.
[01:43:40.840 --> 01:43:43.600]   And so, which I've been, you know,
[01:43:43.600 --> 01:43:45.400]   working with them as well.
[01:43:45.400 --> 01:43:48.680]   But, you know, 'cause the app economy is still just,
[01:43:48.680 --> 01:43:51.000]   you know, there's so many apps
[01:43:51.000 --> 01:43:53.480]   and so many interesting things that people are doing.
[01:43:53.480 --> 01:43:55.720]   - So, do you find the character you don't just capture it?
[01:43:55.720 --> 01:43:57.560]   You have to answer questions.
[01:43:57.560 --> 01:43:58.720]   - Yeah. - You have to be out of fire,
[01:43:58.720 --> 01:44:00.400]   Leo, you have to be out of fire.
[01:44:00.400 --> 01:44:03.200]   - So this is virtual altar boy.
[01:44:03.200 --> 01:44:05.720]   - Yes. - That's hysterical.
[01:44:05.720 --> 01:44:07.160]   - Yeah. - I wanna go back to,
[01:44:07.160 --> 01:44:09.560]   I wanna go back to the question that you asked though,
[01:44:09.560 --> 01:44:11.720]   you know, Leo, which is,
[01:44:11.720 --> 01:44:14.240]   are we still going to be using these things?
[01:44:14.240 --> 01:44:17.160]   - Nobody predicts,
[01:44:17.160 --> 01:44:22.800]   the whole point of truly disruptive technologies
[01:44:22.800 --> 01:44:25.920]   is that, you know, people laugh at them
[01:44:25.920 --> 01:44:28.000]   when they first appear. - Right.
[01:44:28.000 --> 01:44:33.000]   - And they appear and they become possible
[01:44:33.000 --> 01:44:36.960]   because there's no market,
[01:44:36.960 --> 01:44:42.040]   there's no established market that you have to cater to
[01:44:42.040 --> 01:44:44.480]   that you have to satisfy. - That's right.
[01:44:44.480 --> 01:44:47.360]   - And so we mentioned OS X, right,
[01:44:47.360 --> 01:44:50.120]   which was, Renee, it was 2001, right?
[01:44:50.120 --> 01:44:51.800]   - Yes. - And I wanna,
[01:44:51.800 --> 01:44:53.600]   1997, I forget, '97?
[01:44:53.600 --> 01:44:57.840]   - OS X? - No, you're right, yeah.
[01:44:57.840 --> 01:44:59.760]   - It was 2001, I'm sorry. - It was 2001,
[01:44:59.760 --> 01:45:04.760]   but I think it was the same year that the iPod came out
[01:45:04.760 --> 01:45:08.680]   and you go back and you read the reviews of the iPod.
[01:45:08.680 --> 01:45:09.880]   - Oh, that's a good point. - When they did this
[01:45:09.880 --> 01:45:13.360]   two years ago and I think I wrote an article about it
[01:45:13.360 --> 01:45:16.400]   and you go back and you read the reviews of the iPod
[01:45:16.400 --> 01:45:18.120]   and people just laughed at it.
[01:45:18.120 --> 01:45:21.240]   It was this big, clunky thing and it has a hard drive in it
[01:45:21.240 --> 01:45:23.240]   and who's gonna, you know,
[01:45:23.240 --> 01:45:26.120]   that how are they going to sell music and put it on it
[01:45:26.120 --> 01:45:27.880]   and it's only for the Mac. - No, that no match failed.
[01:45:27.880 --> 01:45:32.880]   - It has Macs and yet arguably OS X was,
[01:45:32.880 --> 01:45:37.320]   you know, an important product and everything.
[01:45:37.320 --> 01:45:42.320]   But the iPod is the, you know, the, the...
[01:45:42.320 --> 01:45:45.960]   - Big disruptor.
[01:45:45.960 --> 01:45:50.960]   - The promo, the primogenitor of all the smartphones
[01:45:50.960 --> 01:45:53.880]   and all the mobile technology that we have today,
[01:45:53.880 --> 01:45:57.280]   it all goes back to there and yet it was sort of laughed at
[01:45:57.280 --> 01:46:01.720]   as an expensive toy that, you know,
[01:46:01.720 --> 01:46:05.920]   that, "Oh, you know, is this really gonna be a big thing?"
[01:46:05.920 --> 01:46:10.920]   And yet, you know, relentlessly innovating and developing
[01:46:10.920 --> 01:46:14.760]   and turning it into, you know, tablet and smartphone
[01:46:14.760 --> 01:46:17.920]   and all of that, you know, and that's how disruption works.
[01:46:17.920 --> 01:46:22.400]   So, yeah, you know, we're not, we're not going to be using
[01:46:22.400 --> 01:46:24.920]   the technology that we have now.
[01:46:24.920 --> 01:46:28.680]   In 30 years, people are going to look back at movies
[01:46:28.680 --> 01:46:32.200]   from this time and kids are just going to get the jiggle
[01:46:32.200 --> 01:46:34.120]   at, you know, they're just...
[01:46:34.120 --> 01:46:36.680]   - You just need a size of that phone Leo
[01:46:36.680 --> 01:46:38.280]   is holding up to his head.
[01:46:38.280 --> 01:46:40.280]   (laughing)
[01:46:40.280 --> 01:46:42.000]   - And Bramble Leo, God, how old?
[01:46:42.000 --> 01:46:43.360]   He was 90.
[01:46:43.360 --> 01:46:45.000]   - He was shaped like a banana.
[01:46:45.000 --> 01:46:47.400]   (laughing)
[01:46:47.400 --> 01:46:49.800]   - That's a cord, you had a corded phone Leo?
[01:46:49.800 --> 01:46:52.840]   Denise Howell says the Vatican's also working on
[01:46:52.840 --> 01:46:56.360]   an alternative version of Flappy Bird called Flappy Saints.
[01:46:56.360 --> 01:46:57.680]   But I don't think...
[01:46:57.680 --> 01:46:58.680]   - Did you know Fortnite?
[01:46:58.680 --> 01:47:01.040]   (laughing)
[01:47:01.040 --> 01:47:01.880]   - I hope not.
[01:47:01.880 --> 01:47:03.800]   (laughing)
[01:47:03.800 --> 01:47:05.280]   - With the Swiss guards.
[01:47:05.280 --> 01:47:07.640]   - Yeah, we're going to take a little break,
[01:47:07.640 --> 01:47:10.440]   come back with the silly stories of the week.
[01:47:10.440 --> 01:47:13.720]   And another Pokemon ghost story that's very good news.
[01:47:13.720 --> 01:47:17.920]   But first, I want to tell you how you could take your wifi
[01:47:17.920 --> 01:47:19.880]   and make it all better again.
[01:47:19.880 --> 01:47:21.160]   And I know 'cause I did it.
[01:47:21.160 --> 01:47:23.840]   In just a few minutes, it's the Eero.
[01:47:23.840 --> 01:47:26.520]   This is an enterprise grade wifi system
[01:47:26.520 --> 01:47:28.320]   you can install in under 10 minutes.
[01:47:28.320 --> 01:47:30.960]   You just download the Eero software,
[01:47:30.960 --> 01:47:35.640]   just put it on your phone, unplug your cruddy old router,
[01:47:35.640 --> 01:47:37.080]   and plug in this Eero,
[01:47:37.080 --> 01:47:39.760]   and the phone will walk you through it,
[01:47:39.760 --> 01:47:42.320]   attaching additional Eero beacons
[01:47:42.320 --> 01:47:43.920]   if you need it through the home.
[01:47:43.920 --> 01:47:45.320]   This is a distributed system.
[01:47:45.320 --> 01:47:47.400]   This is what we've had for years,
[01:47:47.400 --> 01:47:49.360]   offices have had for years.
[01:47:49.360 --> 01:47:50.600]   Now you can have it in your home,
[01:47:50.600 --> 01:47:54.840]   and it solves the problem of bad wifi.
[01:47:54.840 --> 01:47:56.920]   Wifi isn't any different.
[01:47:56.920 --> 01:47:58.720]   It's just that we're using it more.
[01:47:58.720 --> 01:48:01.240]   Our neighbors are interfering with us more.
[01:48:01.240 --> 01:48:02.880]   We have how many devices do you have
[01:48:02.880 --> 01:48:04.360]   using wifi in your house?
[01:48:04.360 --> 01:48:06.520]   It used to be maybe one laptop.
[01:48:06.520 --> 01:48:09.840]   I have now at last count 62 different devices
[01:48:09.840 --> 01:48:12.000]   in my home that are on the wifi network.
[01:48:12.000 --> 01:48:14.760]   Between Amazon Echoes, my doorbell,
[01:48:14.760 --> 01:48:16.520]   I mean, it just goes on and on,
[01:48:16.520 --> 01:48:18.360]   and everything's on the wifi.
[01:48:18.360 --> 01:48:19.640]   But Eero can handle it.
[01:48:19.640 --> 01:48:21.240]   The Eero app lets you manage your network
[01:48:21.240 --> 01:48:22.880]   from the palm of your hand.
[01:48:22.880 --> 01:48:25.880]   In fact, that's how I know how many devices I have connected.
[01:48:25.880 --> 01:48:27.920]   It also gets the internet speed.
[01:48:27.920 --> 01:48:28.960]   I love the Eero app.
[01:48:28.960 --> 01:48:33.800]   And Eero Plus, which is really nice, is fantastic.
[01:48:33.800 --> 01:48:36.360]   Eero Plus is, in fact, I'll show you,
[01:48:36.360 --> 01:48:39.960]   'cause I have Eero Plus, I've been subscribed to it,
[01:48:39.960 --> 01:48:41.080]   and I love it.
[01:48:41.080 --> 01:48:43.080]   We have five euros in the house.
[01:48:43.080 --> 01:48:45.160]   Eero Plus, so you can see everything looks good.
[01:48:45.160 --> 01:48:46.400]   There's the five euros.
[01:48:46.400 --> 01:48:49.040]   Here's the bandwidth, the recent bandwidth test.
[01:48:49.040 --> 01:48:51.720]   I could take a look at the Eero Plus settings.
[01:48:51.720 --> 01:48:54.120]   Look at all the stuff I get for free, by the way,
[01:48:54.120 --> 01:48:55.160]   with Eero Plus.
[01:48:55.160 --> 01:48:58.840]   13,000 sites were inspected this week.
[01:48:58.840 --> 01:49:02.640]   I can go back to the previous month, as well as I want.
[01:49:02.640 --> 01:49:06.760]   In fact, through October, a million 85 sets sites
[01:49:06.760 --> 01:49:08.880]   that we went to in the house inspected.
[01:49:08.880 --> 01:49:10.480]   The good news is they didn't have to do
[01:49:10.480 --> 01:49:11.960]   any threat blocks this week.
[01:49:11.960 --> 01:49:13.880]   There were a few in weeks past.
[01:49:13.880 --> 01:49:17.440]   These were malicious malware that was blocked.
[01:49:17.440 --> 01:49:19.160]   Spyware that was blocked.
[01:49:19.160 --> 01:49:21.600]   Botnets, phishing attacks that were blocked.
[01:49:21.600 --> 01:49:24.040]   Content filters, I have those turned on
[01:49:24.040 --> 01:49:27.080]   for our 15-year-old, and it will protect him.
[01:49:27.080 --> 01:49:29.840]   Advanced security, even ad blocking.
[01:49:29.840 --> 01:49:32.560]   I love, and this is all part of the router.
[01:49:32.560 --> 01:49:33.840]   The Eero is fantastic.
[01:49:33.840 --> 01:49:35.520]   Guess, ask, access.
[01:49:35.520 --> 01:49:37.520]   I like it so much I installed at my mom's house
[01:49:37.520 --> 01:49:40.200]   'cause she was having problems as well.
[01:49:40.200 --> 01:49:42.840]   This Eero automatically will tag sites that contain
[01:49:42.840 --> 01:49:44.600]   violent, illegal, or adult content.
[01:49:44.600 --> 01:49:46.760]   You could choose what your kids can and cannot see,
[01:49:46.760 --> 01:49:48.200]   and you could do that in the app.
[01:49:48.200 --> 01:49:50.560]   I can even say to my Amazon Echo,
[01:49:50.560 --> 01:49:54.680]   pause Michael's internet if he acts up,
[01:49:54.680 --> 01:49:57.160]   and it turns off his internet.
[01:49:57.160 --> 01:49:58.080]   Not mine.
[01:49:58.080 --> 01:49:59.160]   I still can surf.
[01:49:59.160 --> 01:50:00.960]   I can still play Pokemon Go,
[01:50:00.960 --> 01:50:02.840]   but he's got to go to bed now.
[01:50:02.840 --> 01:50:04.720]   Oh, Michael.
[01:50:04.720 --> 01:50:07.320]   Eero and Eero Plus provides complete protection
[01:50:07.320 --> 01:50:08.600]   for your network, your devices,
[01:50:08.600 --> 01:50:11.400]   and all of those who use them as they connect
[01:50:11.400 --> 01:50:14.560]   to the internet, and I love that.
[01:50:14.560 --> 01:50:18.000]   Make your Wi-Fi work again
[01:50:18.000 --> 01:50:20.880]   with the best router, Eero.
[01:50:20.880 --> 01:50:22.760]   Eero also, and this is really important
[01:50:22.760 --> 01:50:24.160]   for any device that goes on the internet,
[01:50:24.160 --> 01:50:25.800]   automatically updates.
[01:50:25.800 --> 01:50:27.240]   You not only get the latest features,
[01:50:27.240 --> 01:50:29.880]   but the latest in security at all times.
[01:50:29.880 --> 01:50:32.720]   WPA3, yep, they just said, we'll be doing it.
[01:50:32.720 --> 01:50:35.600]   It'll be a software update on the Eero router.
[01:50:35.600 --> 01:50:36.360]   Things like that.
[01:50:36.360 --> 01:50:40.120]   It's really nice to know Eero is taking care of you
[01:50:40.120 --> 01:50:40.960]   at all times.
[01:50:40.960 --> 01:50:44.000]   I am a huge fan of Eero.
[01:50:44.000 --> 01:50:46.960]   Life's too short for bad Wi-Fi.
[01:50:46.960 --> 01:50:50.440]   Right now, just get $100 off the Eero base unit
[01:50:50.440 --> 01:50:53.200]   and two beacons package, $100 off,
[01:50:53.200 --> 01:50:55.920]   and this is the best offer we've ever had,
[01:50:55.920 --> 01:50:58.080]   a year of Eero Plus.
[01:50:58.080 --> 01:51:00.520]   And all you have to do is go to Eero, E-E-R-O,
[01:51:00.520 --> 01:51:04.160]   Eero.com/twit, and I know the offer code Twit at checkout.
[01:51:04.160 --> 01:51:06.000]   If you've been waiting, if you've heard me talk about
[01:51:06.000 --> 01:51:07.360]   how much I love our Eero,
[01:51:07.360 --> 01:51:11.360]   and look at all the stuff you get with Eero Plus,
[01:51:11.360 --> 01:51:13.320]   this is the best offer we've ever offered.
[01:51:13.320 --> 01:51:14.160]   This is great.
[01:51:14.160 --> 01:51:16.520]   $100 off the base unit and two beacons.
[01:51:16.520 --> 01:51:17.720]   That's what you want pretty much.
[01:51:17.720 --> 01:51:21.080]   That's what we have five, but most people three is good.
[01:51:21.080 --> 01:51:24.000]   That's $100 off and a year of Eero Plus.
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:26.280]   I think that's worth 99 bucks.
[01:51:26.280 --> 01:51:31.120]   Eero.com/twit, enter the code Twit at checkout.
[01:51:31.120 --> 01:51:33.320]   It's just transfer.
[01:51:33.320 --> 01:51:36.120]   I got so tired of Lisa saying the Wi-Fi now,
[01:51:36.120 --> 01:51:39.640]   and I just had to get the Eero.
[01:51:39.640 --> 01:51:41.520]   She actually, you know she got me to do it.
[01:51:41.520 --> 01:51:45.480]   She said, "I'm gonna have John Russell and Burke come
[01:51:45.480 --> 01:51:47.000]   and fix our Wi-Fi."
[01:51:47.000 --> 01:51:49.240]   (laughing)
[01:51:49.240 --> 01:51:52.440]   But, but, but, but, but, but, you're married to the tech guy.
[01:51:52.440 --> 01:51:53.920]   But, but, but, but, but.
[01:51:53.920 --> 01:51:55.000]   That's when I got the Eero.
[01:51:55.000 --> 01:51:56.800]   At least it wasn't Manny, Mo, and Jack.
[01:51:56.800 --> 01:51:58.120]   (laughing)
[01:51:58.120 --> 01:51:59.600]   I'm getting those Starbucks people.
[01:51:59.600 --> 01:52:00.600]   John Russell and my wife,
[01:52:00.600 --> 01:52:02.360]   like, "She says, 'All I have to do is give them a free dinner
[01:52:02.360 --> 01:52:03.200]   and they'll do it.'"
[01:52:03.200 --> 01:52:11.480]   I said, "Dee, I want that dinner!" (laughing)
[01:52:11.480 --> 01:52:13.640]   It cured the problem, let me tell ya.
[01:52:13.640 --> 01:52:15.200]   All right, couple of weird stories.
[01:52:15.200 --> 01:52:16.040]   How about this?
[01:52:16.040 --> 01:52:19.840]   This is a painting that sold at Christie's at Art Auction.
[01:52:19.840 --> 01:52:22.320]   It's a painting called "Edmond de Bellamy"
[01:52:22.320 --> 01:52:27.160]   from La Famine de Bellamy by the French art collected obvious,
[01:52:27.160 --> 01:52:31.240]   painted entirely by artificial intelligence
[01:52:31.240 --> 01:52:33.320]   after looking in machine learning
[01:52:33.320 --> 01:52:36.240]   a bunch of classic paintings.
[01:52:36.240 --> 01:52:38.080]   And, and this sold at Christie's.
[01:52:38.080 --> 01:52:39.240]   Are you ready for this?
[01:52:39.240 --> 01:52:45.400]   $432,500.
[01:52:45.400 --> 01:52:47.000]   - PT Barnum is cheering and is good.
[01:52:47.000 --> 01:52:47.840]   (laughing)
[01:52:47.840 --> 01:52:48.960]   - And, and, and, and, and, and,
[01:52:48.960 --> 01:52:49.800]   - Is that what you're saying?
[01:52:49.800 --> 01:52:54.320]   - The developer who, you know, wrote the, the code
[01:52:54.320 --> 01:52:57.000]   and the, the primary algorithms behind that
[01:52:57.000 --> 01:52:59.880]   is as I understand it, didn't get a dime.
[01:52:59.880 --> 01:53:00.720]   - What?
[01:53:01.400 --> 01:53:03.080]   - Why not?
[01:53:03.080 --> 01:53:05.720]   - Well, that's, that's,
[01:53:05.720 --> 01:53:06.560]   - Work for hire?
[01:53:06.560 --> 01:53:08.640]   - That's just $132, $1,000.
[01:53:08.640 --> 01:53:11.160]   - Is it minus Torvalds who did it?
[01:53:11.160 --> 01:53:13.440]   So what we don't know is who bought it,
[01:53:13.440 --> 01:53:16.680]   but it, cause it was an anonymous phone bidder.
[01:53:16.680 --> 01:53:17.960]   - It was Sergei.
[01:53:17.960 --> 01:53:20.120]   - It's, you know what, that's what it is, right?
[01:53:20.120 --> 01:53:24.480]   It's Andy Rubin, he got 90 million from Google, you know.
[01:53:24.480 --> 01:53:26.560]   He probably bought, somebody bought it who said,
[01:53:26.560 --> 01:53:27.400]   "Hey," - And he said
[01:53:27.400 --> 01:53:28.440]   the best that money quick.
[01:53:28.440 --> 01:53:31.440]   - If you're so, if you, if you're so rich,
[01:53:31.440 --> 01:53:34.120]   you know, if you're as rich as Larry Page
[01:53:34.120 --> 01:53:37.080]   or Jeff Bezos, that's $20.
[01:53:37.080 --> 01:53:39.560]   Yeah, I'll lay down $20 to buy, buy that.
[01:53:39.560 --> 01:53:41.840]   I'll have a piece of history.
[01:53:41.840 --> 01:53:42.800]   - The money I'm drunk,
[01:53:42.800 --> 01:53:44.960]   - The company, the company, the buying Christie stuff.
[01:53:44.960 --> 01:53:46.240]   - Part of it, too.
[01:53:46.240 --> 01:53:48.280]   - The perfect punch line for that would have been
[01:53:48.280 --> 01:53:51.720]   if it had, you know, as soon as they hit the gavel
[01:53:51.720 --> 01:53:54.680]   on their zoom down through a shredder.
[01:53:54.680 --> 01:53:55.520]   - Yes.
[01:53:55.520 --> 01:53:57.040]   - Into like the Banksy painting.
[01:53:57.040 --> 01:53:59.840]   - Banksy thing is, it's a surprise.
[01:53:59.840 --> 01:54:01.040]   - So this was a painting,
[01:54:01.040 --> 01:54:02.880]   - This was a painting the Banksy did,
[01:54:02.880 --> 01:54:04.840]   it went for a lot of money.
[01:54:04.840 --> 01:54:06.880]   And as soon as the gavel went down,
[01:54:06.880 --> 01:54:09.480]   there was a shredder built into this surprisingly large frame
[01:54:09.480 --> 01:54:10.800]   and it shredded it.
[01:54:10.800 --> 01:54:14.120]   Now here's my question, did the, the bitter still have to buy it?
[01:54:14.120 --> 01:54:16.480]   - The bitter not only had to buy it,
[01:54:16.480 --> 01:54:20.320]   the bitter wound up with a, a bag of.
[01:54:20.320 --> 01:54:21.440]   - Shredded painting.
[01:54:21.440 --> 01:54:24.520]   - Shredded stuff that was worth 10 times
[01:54:24.520 --> 01:54:26.520]   what he paid for the original piece of art
[01:54:26.520 --> 01:54:29.800]   because it's a Banksy project.
[01:54:29.800 --> 01:54:32.200]   - It's more than, it's more than,
[01:54:32.200 --> 01:54:34.960]   it's performance art, it's more than just,
[01:54:34.960 --> 01:54:40.160]   wait, let me see if I can show this being shredded.
[01:54:40.160 --> 01:54:45.360]   It's more than just the painting now.
[01:54:45.360 --> 01:54:47.480]   It's a shredding.
[01:54:47.480 --> 01:54:51.000]   This is actually them building the frame.
[01:54:51.000 --> 01:54:55.360]   And this is the auction at Sotheby's.
[01:54:55.360 --> 01:54:56.200]   There's the art.
[01:54:56.200 --> 01:54:59.960]   I have that Banksy painting on a magnet.
[01:54:59.960 --> 01:55:01.200]   Hasn't been shredded yet.
[01:55:01.200 --> 01:55:03.680]   Look at it going, man.
[01:55:03.680 --> 01:55:04.960]   The people are going crazy.
[01:55:04.960 --> 01:55:11.920]   Let's jump ahead.
[01:55:11.920 --> 01:55:14.880]   Oh, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[01:55:14.880 --> 01:55:18.240]   So there's the auctioneer.
[01:55:18.240 --> 01:55:19.920]   He lowered the gavel.
[01:55:19.920 --> 01:55:23.440]   People are going, oh my God, it's, it's being shredded.
[01:55:25.360 --> 01:55:27.120]   You're taking it off the wall.
[01:55:27.120 --> 01:55:40.360]   - So, my wish was, I wish they'd just gone one step further
[01:55:40.360 --> 01:55:44.640]   and made the paper canvas or whatever it was on.
[01:55:44.640 --> 01:55:48.560]   Made that like a, something with a half life
[01:55:48.560 --> 01:55:50.840]   of like three days or something.
[01:55:50.840 --> 01:55:53.440]   So you've got this bag of, of.
[01:55:53.440 --> 01:55:55.840]   - I have that burst into the paper.
[01:55:55.840 --> 01:55:58.240]   And then it either bursts into flame
[01:55:58.240 --> 01:56:02.560]   or it disintegrates into a pile of ashes or dust or something.
[01:56:02.560 --> 01:56:05.880]   And basically it just comes down to when you're done,
[01:56:05.880 --> 01:56:06.880]   when you're done with it,
[01:56:06.880 --> 01:56:10.080]   there's this little compressed thing,
[01:56:10.080 --> 01:56:12.960]   a little ball that you can squeeze into
[01:56:12.960 --> 01:56:14.400]   make a diamond out of it.
[01:56:14.400 --> 01:56:16.640]   - The more you destroy it, the more it's worth.
[01:56:16.640 --> 01:56:18.520]   - Yeah, one of this becomes a thing.
[01:56:18.520 --> 01:56:20.840]   It reminds me of those, the Buddhist monks
[01:56:20.840 --> 01:56:23.040]   that they work for, you know.
[01:56:23.040 --> 01:56:26.040]   - Those mandalas, the sand mandalas, they have beautiful.
[01:56:26.040 --> 01:56:29.560]   - For, they'll work for months, you know,
[01:56:29.560 --> 01:56:32.520]   building those, sorry, creating those
[01:56:32.520 --> 01:56:34.960]   and they're just stunning.
[01:56:34.960 --> 01:56:37.960]   And then they get done and they let everybody see it.
[01:56:37.960 --> 01:56:40.560]   And then like 24 hours later, they just sweep it all up.
[01:56:40.560 --> 01:56:41.560]   - Yeah, they just, they.
[01:56:41.560 --> 01:56:42.880]   - After they have hours and hours.
[01:56:42.880 --> 01:56:46.440]   - And to remind you of the impermanence of life.
[01:56:46.440 --> 01:56:47.280]   - Of this world.
[01:56:47.280 --> 01:56:50.280]   - Here's an example, it's a beautiful sand mandala.
[01:56:50.280 --> 01:56:51.840]   They've made it and they're all happy.
[01:56:51.840 --> 01:56:53.240]   Is that the Dalai Lama?
[01:56:53.240 --> 01:56:54.080]   I don't know.
[01:56:54.080 --> 01:56:54.920]   - Yeah, that is.
[01:56:54.920 --> 01:56:57.760]   - All monks look the same to me and then boom.
[01:56:57.760 --> 01:56:59.360]   It's just scoop it all up.
[01:56:59.360 --> 01:57:00.800]   - Scoop it up, we need to get that sand.
[01:57:00.800 --> 01:57:01.880]   - Clear the llama and not a felon.
[01:57:01.880 --> 01:57:02.720]   - Detachment.
[01:57:02.720 --> 01:57:04.800]   - Yeah, that's detachment all right.
[01:57:04.800 --> 01:57:08.280]   I spent, I spent your life making this.
[01:57:08.280 --> 01:57:09.920]   And now I'm just gonna suffer.
[01:57:09.920 --> 01:57:11.080]   - Life is suffering.
[01:57:11.080 --> 01:57:12.400]   - Yeah, wow.
[01:57:12.400 --> 01:57:14.280]   - There is no mirror, where will it find dust?
[01:57:14.280 --> 01:57:15.120]   - Wow.
[01:57:15.120 --> 01:57:19.400]   - Elon Musk speaking of crazy.
[01:57:20.400 --> 01:57:22.680]   - You know, you can just pick any story,
[01:57:22.680 --> 01:57:23.720]   but this one's interesting.
[01:57:23.720 --> 01:57:26.880]   The first tunnel under LA will open on December 10th.
[01:57:26.880 --> 01:57:32.480]   The boring company is offering free rise to the public.
[01:57:32.480 --> 01:57:37.080]   According to, I don't know, it's Elon's tweet, Twitter.
[01:57:37.080 --> 01:57:38.240]   I don't know.
[01:57:38.240 --> 01:57:39.080]   - Was it fair?
[01:57:39.080 --> 01:57:41.240]   Was it overseen?
[01:57:41.240 --> 01:57:42.080]   - Yeah.
[01:57:42.080 --> 01:57:45.000]   I don't know where it goes.
[01:57:45.000 --> 01:57:46.720]   I don't know how it works,
[01:57:46.720 --> 01:57:50.240]   but it will be open December 10th.
[01:57:50.240 --> 01:57:53.480]   It's a two mile test tunnel under the SpaceX headquarters
[01:57:53.480 --> 01:57:55.560]   in Hawthorne, California.
[01:57:55.560 --> 01:57:58.560]   Remember, he wants to make a public transportation system
[01:57:58.560 --> 01:57:59.720]   that basically,
[01:57:59.720 --> 01:58:03.480]   - This would be, this is the setup
[01:58:03.480 --> 01:58:05.960]   for a great Black Mirror episode.
[01:58:05.960 --> 01:58:07.720]   - I think it is.
[01:58:07.720 --> 01:58:10.280]   - People are getting on this thing
[01:58:10.280 --> 01:58:12.280]   and then it goes into the tunnel.
[01:58:12.280 --> 01:58:13.800]   - I mean, they know that.
[01:58:13.800 --> 01:58:15.560]   - And they come out on Mars.
[01:58:15.560 --> 01:58:19.080]   - Look, we built the colony and for earlier two.
[01:58:19.080 --> 01:58:21.920]   - Oh, you're so glad you came.
[01:58:21.920 --> 01:58:26.320]   - Deplane, deplane, the tunnel.
[01:58:26.320 --> 01:58:30.080]   - Pokemon Go will soon use Apple Health and Google Fit data
[01:58:30.080 --> 01:58:31.280]   to hatch eggs and earn candy
[01:58:31.280 --> 01:58:33.160]   just in the process of life itself.
[01:58:33.160 --> 01:58:35.320]   I know you're happy about that, Renee.
[01:58:35.320 --> 01:58:36.520]   - I am ecstatic.
[01:58:36.520 --> 01:58:38.160]   I mean, not having to leave that stupid app open
[01:58:38.160 --> 01:58:39.320]   as I go for my morning walk.
[01:58:39.320 --> 01:58:42.880]   - I believe you owe me a gift, by the way.
[01:58:42.880 --> 01:58:45.520]   I, you know, I have to apologize to every
[01:58:45.520 --> 01:58:47.360]   everybody because September and October is so crazy.
[01:58:47.360 --> 01:58:48.720]   I barely have time to play.
[01:58:48.720 --> 01:58:49.560]   - You're too busy.
[01:58:49.560 --> 01:58:51.120]   - You're too busy to play.
[01:58:51.120 --> 01:58:52.120]   - But I'll send you something, Leon.
[01:58:52.120 --> 01:58:53.240]   - You're missing the Halloween.
[01:58:53.240 --> 01:58:55.000]   You're missing the great Halloween event.
[01:58:55.000 --> 01:58:56.960]   - I got a 98% Jira Tina.
[01:58:56.960 --> 01:58:59.480]   I feel like I can just retire for the month.
[01:58:59.480 --> 01:59:00.440]   - You're so cool.
[01:59:00.440 --> 01:59:02.160]   You're so cool, much cooler than me.
[01:59:02.160 --> 01:59:04.640]   - There's a free time on my hands.
[01:59:04.640 --> 01:59:08.680]   - And this is, okay, I shouldn't end on a down note,
[01:59:08.680 --> 01:59:11.320]   but this kind of depressed me, Breaker,
[01:59:11.320 --> 01:59:15.240]   which is a Bitcoin crypto site.
[01:59:15.240 --> 01:59:20.240]   Sent emails to a bunch of other crypto sites saying,
[01:59:20.240 --> 01:59:22.360]   hey, basically posing,
[01:59:22.360 --> 01:59:25.920]   I'm representing a blockchain PR company from Moscow.
[01:59:25.920 --> 01:59:30.360]   And what I would like is for you to put coverage
[01:59:30.360 --> 01:59:33.960]   about my clients and have it not be marked sponsored,
[01:59:33.960 --> 01:59:35.200]   is that possible?
[01:59:35.200 --> 01:59:40.520]   And of the 22 outlets who replied conclusively 12 of them,
[01:59:40.520 --> 01:59:42.200]   were willing to publish paid content
[01:59:42.200 --> 01:59:43.520]   without disclosing as such,
[01:59:43.520 --> 01:59:44.800]   which by the way is illegal,
[01:59:44.800 --> 01:59:47.480]   according to the FTC, but who's gonna catch you?
[01:59:47.480 --> 01:59:48.440]   - In this country.
[01:59:48.440 --> 01:59:51.000]   - In this country, and many of these aren't probably.
[01:59:51.000 --> 01:59:55.640]   And just a word of warning, we don't do paid content.
[01:59:55.640 --> 01:59:59.120]   But I have to say, and I'm sure you do too,
[01:59:59.120 --> 02:00:02.360]   solicitations every day from people say,
[02:00:02.360 --> 02:00:04.880]   we'd like to put something in your blog.
[02:00:04.880 --> 02:00:05.960]   - Yeah.
[02:00:05.960 --> 02:00:08.000]   - My policy is like I never talked to you again.
[02:00:08.000 --> 02:00:09.920]   Once that happens, there's no way to avoid.
[02:00:09.920 --> 02:00:13.080]   I could just never talk to you again in your capacity.
[02:00:13.080 --> 02:00:16.280]   - So if you want to move this from the downer category
[02:00:16.280 --> 02:00:18.320]   to the absurd category,
[02:00:18.320 --> 02:00:23.960]   a few months ago, four or five months ago,
[02:00:23.960 --> 02:00:26.880]   I changed my Twitter bio.
[02:00:26.880 --> 02:00:31.480]   And just for grins,
[02:00:31.480 --> 02:00:34.880]   I put in something there about blockchain.
[02:00:34.880 --> 02:00:37.040]   And it was a, I mean, and it was--
[02:00:37.040 --> 02:00:39.720]   - You are a Twitter master head, I must say.
[02:00:39.720 --> 02:00:41.560]   - Just a dumb joke.
[02:00:41.560 --> 02:00:43.320]   - I put in there. - I have to you.
[02:00:43.320 --> 02:00:48.320]   - You know, I think the way it reads now is something like,
[02:00:48.320 --> 02:00:50.760]   you know, my blockchain can beat your blockchain
[02:00:50.760 --> 02:00:52.880]   or something like that.
[02:00:52.880 --> 02:00:57.640]   But within days after I changed that bio,
[02:00:57.640 --> 02:01:00.640]   I started getting, first of all followers,
[02:01:00.640 --> 02:01:05.880]   secondly, email solicitations and direct messages
[02:01:05.880 --> 02:01:09.240]   from people wanting to fly me to blockchain conferences.
[02:01:09.240 --> 02:01:10.080]   - Wow.
[02:01:10.080 --> 02:01:15.080]   - You know, offer exclusive stories
[02:01:15.080 --> 02:01:18.440]   about their blockchain product and everything.
[02:01:18.440 --> 02:01:20.800]   And so yeah, this is--
[02:01:20.800 --> 02:01:22.640]   - It's getting my bio right now.
[02:01:22.640 --> 02:01:24.440]   (laughing)
[02:01:24.440 --> 02:01:27.160]   - It's just, I mean, you want, you know,
[02:01:27.160 --> 02:01:30.840]   you know, Donald Trump was really upset this week
[02:01:30.840 --> 02:01:34.600]   because he lost 2,000 Twitter followers two days in a row.
[02:01:34.600 --> 02:01:39.600]   If he had just put blockchain in his bio,
[02:01:40.600 --> 02:01:42.600]   that problem would go away.
[02:01:42.600 --> 02:01:44.200]   - Oh, I had a similar thing this week.
[02:01:44.200 --> 02:01:45.640]   I got stuck on the YouTube homepage.
[02:01:45.640 --> 02:01:46.840]   I started getting tons of followers
[02:01:46.840 --> 02:01:49.480]   and like 75% of them follow,
[02:01:49.480 --> 02:01:51.240]   subscribe and unsubscribe immediately.
[02:01:51.240 --> 02:01:52.800]   So I saw this huge like spike
[02:01:52.800 --> 02:01:54.720]   and then this huge spike in unsubscribers.
[02:01:54.720 --> 02:01:55.960]   And it was very hard to take, Leon.
[02:01:55.960 --> 02:01:58.840]   - I feel bad, I'm missing all the fun.
[02:01:58.840 --> 02:02:00.680]   It's all happening.
[02:02:00.680 --> 02:02:02.400]   All right, I'm gonna end with some upbeat stories.
[02:02:02.400 --> 02:02:04.120]   First, the copyright office has ruled
[02:02:04.120 --> 02:02:06.800]   that you have the right to repair
[02:02:06.800 --> 02:02:08.800]   thanks to SORIC.
[02:02:08.800 --> 02:02:14.000]   Jay SORIC is of CDI iPhone jailbreaking fame.
[02:02:14.000 --> 02:02:17.000]   The electronic frontier foundation.
[02:02:17.000 --> 02:02:18.440]   I fix it.
[02:02:18.440 --> 02:02:21.320]   Kyle Wiens and his attorney, Cynthia Replogel,
[02:02:21.320 --> 02:02:23.280]   Corey Doctorow Kit Walsh and Mitch Stoltz
[02:02:23.280 --> 02:02:25.040]   from the electronic frontier foundation.
[02:02:25.040 --> 02:02:27.960]   They filed a long brief.
[02:02:27.960 --> 02:02:32.280]   They went and they testified at 342 pages
[02:02:32.280 --> 02:02:33.640]   of background information.
[02:02:33.640 --> 02:02:37.080]   The final ruling released and it's good news.
[02:02:37.080 --> 02:02:39.520]   The copyright office says you can now jailbreak
[02:02:39.520 --> 02:02:41.920]   Alexa powered hardware and other similar gadgets.
[02:02:41.920 --> 02:02:44.080]   They call them voice assistant devices.
[02:02:44.080 --> 02:02:47.840]   You can unlock new phones, not just used ones.
[02:02:47.840 --> 02:02:49.720]   There's an exemption for repair of,
[02:02:49.720 --> 02:02:53.120]   this is because the DMCA says you can't reverse engineer
[02:02:53.120 --> 02:02:54.000]   copy protection.
[02:02:54.000 --> 02:02:55.600]   They need all these exemptions.
[02:02:55.600 --> 02:02:58.000]   There's an exemption for repair of smartphones,
[02:02:58.000 --> 02:03:00.120]   home appliances or home systems.
[02:03:00.120 --> 02:03:03.240]   Repair of, this is a huge one.
[02:03:03.240 --> 02:03:06.120]   Remember John Deere doesn't let you repair your tractor.
[02:03:06.120 --> 02:03:08.920]   Repair of motorized land vehicles including tractors
[02:03:08.920 --> 02:03:11.200]   by modifying the software is now legal.
[02:03:11.200 --> 02:03:14.760]   This includes access to telematic diagnostic data
[02:03:14.760 --> 02:03:17.160]   which was a major point of contention.
[02:03:17.160 --> 02:03:19.880]   And it's legal for third parties to perform repairs
[02:03:19.880 --> 02:03:22.200]   on the behalf of the owner.
[02:03:22.200 --> 02:03:24.160]   So this is a big change.
[02:03:24.160 --> 02:03:25.880]   Thank you the copyright office.
[02:03:25.880 --> 02:03:26.720]   Yay.
[02:03:26.720 --> 02:03:27.800]   Yay.
[02:03:27.800 --> 02:03:28.760]   - Yeah, that's a win.
[02:03:28.760 --> 02:03:29.880]   - It's a big win.
[02:03:29.880 --> 02:03:31.760]   They did try a little more.
[02:03:31.760 --> 02:03:34.480]   They wanted game console repairs to be legal
[02:03:34.480 --> 02:03:35.840]   on the PS4 and Xbox One.
[02:03:35.840 --> 02:03:37.940]   That is not gonna happen.
[02:03:37.940 --> 02:03:41.680]   They also said that it has to be products
[02:03:41.680 --> 02:03:43.720]   that are smartphones, home appliances or home systems
[02:03:43.720 --> 02:03:46.800]   or motorized land vehicles, boat and airplane owners.
[02:03:46.800 --> 02:03:49.400]   You still can't re-flare your boat and airplane.
[02:03:49.400 --> 02:03:53.040]   And Bunny Wong and the EFF wanted to bypass HDCP,
[02:03:53.040 --> 02:03:55.200]   the HDMI copy protection.
[02:03:55.200 --> 02:03:56.440]   And that was denied as well.
[02:03:56.440 --> 02:03:58.720]   But it's generally a win.
[02:03:58.720 --> 02:04:02.000]   And you know what, a lot of credit goes to this group
[02:04:02.000 --> 02:04:06.440]   of people from the EFF and I fix it who worked so hard.
[02:04:06.440 --> 02:04:09.880]   A team of students from Stanford's IP Law Clinic,
[02:04:09.880 --> 02:04:13.560]   they were fighting the MPAA, the RIAA, the audio alliance,
[02:04:13.560 --> 02:04:15.520]   John Deirb, so many companies.
[02:04:15.520 --> 02:04:16.360]   And they were-
[02:04:16.360 --> 02:04:17.200]   - Good work.
[02:04:17.200 --> 02:04:18.560]   - Good work.
[02:04:18.560 --> 02:04:20.440]   So you see, we ended on a happy note.
[02:04:20.440 --> 02:04:21.280]   - Yes.
[02:04:21.280 --> 02:04:23.680]   - I'm gonna try to shred my Banksy magnet.
[02:04:23.680 --> 02:04:24.840]   I don't think it'll work.
[02:04:24.840 --> 02:04:26.560]   (both laughing)
[02:04:26.560 --> 02:04:29.560]   And thank you guys for being here.
[02:04:29.560 --> 02:04:32.080]   When do you go to New York, Renee, Richie, tomorrow?
[02:04:32.080 --> 02:04:33.440]   - Yes, I certainly leave tomorrow.
[02:04:33.440 --> 02:04:34.960]   - Have a great trip.
[02:04:34.960 --> 02:04:35.800]   - Thank you so much.
[02:04:35.800 --> 02:04:36.640]   - I'll be looking for you in the audience
[02:04:36.640 --> 02:04:39.280]   at the Berkeley Academy of Music Tuesday morning bright
[02:04:39.280 --> 02:04:40.440]   and early.
[02:04:40.440 --> 02:04:42.040]   - And we'll see you back on Mac Break Weekly
[02:04:42.040 --> 02:04:43.000]   a week from Tuesday.
[02:04:43.000 --> 02:04:43.840]   Thank you Renee.
[02:04:43.840 --> 02:04:44.680]   - Awesome, I can't wait.
[02:04:44.680 --> 02:04:47.080]   - I'm more.com/vector for the Vector podcast.
[02:04:47.080 --> 02:04:49.200]   I'm more.com for everything Renee does.
[02:04:49.200 --> 02:04:51.720]   Thank you, Ed Bot.
[02:04:51.720 --> 02:04:53.960]   The Ed Bot report on ZDNet is a must read.
[02:04:53.960 --> 02:04:56.480]   And now I know I have to find a way to follow you
[02:04:56.480 --> 02:05:00.160]   on Twitter, @Ed Bot for all the fun and games.
[02:05:00.160 --> 02:05:02.760]   Have a wonderful evening Ed, thanks for being here.
[02:05:02.760 --> 02:05:04.120]   - And my pleasure.
[02:05:04.120 --> 02:05:05.120]   - Always great to have you.
[02:05:05.120 --> 02:05:07.320]   And of course, you too, Jason Liner,
[02:05:07.320 --> 02:05:10.560]   editor in chief of Tech Republic CBS Interactive.
[02:05:10.560 --> 02:05:11.600]   What do you have planned tonight?
[02:05:11.600 --> 02:05:12.880]   You're gonna watch the World Series
[02:05:12.880 --> 02:05:13.840]   or is there something going on?
[02:05:13.840 --> 02:05:14.680]   Anything going on?
[02:05:14.680 --> 02:05:15.520]   - Rob, we'll be looking.
[02:05:15.520 --> 02:05:17.320]   - You've got the talking basketball, anything.
[02:05:17.320 --> 02:05:19.000]   - No, probably a little bit of World Series
[02:05:19.000 --> 02:05:21.040]   allow Indiana University basketball,
[02:05:21.040 --> 02:05:23.920]   not Kentucky and even though I live in Louisville,
[02:05:23.920 --> 02:05:24.760]   Kentucky. - I know you.
[02:05:24.760 --> 02:05:25.600]   - That's okay.
[02:05:25.600 --> 02:05:27.320]   - You wanna put a plug in for again,
[02:05:27.320 --> 02:05:29.320]   that series that I mentioned on Tech Republic,
[02:05:29.320 --> 02:05:33.200]   our seven part series on election cybersecurity,
[02:05:33.200 --> 02:05:35.320]   the states and the stuff that they're doing.
[02:05:35.320 --> 02:05:40.320]   Great stuff from Alice in Dinesco and Macy Bairne.
[02:05:40.320 --> 02:05:42.240]   Great stuff there.
[02:05:42.240 --> 02:05:44.560]   And then for the IBM Red Hat stuff,
[02:05:44.560 --> 02:05:48.120]   those are interested in learning more about the implications.
[02:05:48.120 --> 02:05:50.080]   Tech Republic and ZDNet will have it covered
[02:05:50.080 --> 02:05:52.400]   from every angle this week.
[02:05:52.400 --> 02:05:56.000]   So we have lots of smart people that will have
[02:05:56.000 --> 02:05:57.000]   good coverage there.
[02:05:57.000 --> 02:05:59.480]   - You do it a lot of security focus these days,
[02:05:59.480 --> 02:06:00.640]   which is really excellent.
[02:06:00.640 --> 02:06:03.040]   I'm very grateful to you for that.
[02:06:03.040 --> 02:06:03.880]   - Awesome.
