[00:00:34.400 --> 00:00:36.400]   Hello Armenia.

[00:00:55.100 --> 00:00:56.600]   It's time to begin.
[00:00:56.600 --> 00:01:03.000]   Another Twit, a Sunday afternoon and gathered around to talk about the latest tech news are
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.200]   some of my favorite Twits starting off, of course, with the star of the show.
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:10.400]   Ladies and gentlemen, John C. Devorak at devorak.org/blog.
[00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:12.400]   Yes, visit often.

[00:01:13.400 --> 00:01:14.600]   You know, visit twice.

[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:16.600]   Hello Leo.
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:17.600]   Hello John.
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:19.600]   Alex Lindsey from the Pixel Core is here.
[00:01:19.600 --> 00:01:21.600]   Of course, our cohort and many other projects.
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:25.600]   And Alex has been working hard on something we'll talk about a little later on that might
[00:01:25.600 --> 00:01:26.600]   excite some people.
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:31.600]   Will Harris from England and bit-tech.net?
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.000]   And also from Engadget as of this week.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:35.900]   Well, congratulations.
[00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:40.900]   I'm doing a legal column for Engadget so you can catch that every couple of weeks I think.
[00:01:40.900 --> 00:01:44.600]   Many don't know that you actually studied law at university.
[00:01:44.600 --> 00:01:47.600]   Absolutely for my sins.
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:50.800]   And the elder statesman of the group and I'm really glad to get him back.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:55.560]   Jerry Pournell, Dr. Pournell, of course, very well known science fiction author but from
[00:01:55.560 --> 00:01:57.920]   the tech community best known for his columns.
[00:01:57.920 --> 00:02:07.720]   I didn't realize this since 1979 in Bite Magazine Chaos Manor and now at chaosmannerreviews.com.
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:08.720]   Is that right?
[00:02:08.720 --> 00:02:09.720]   That's it.
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:10.720]   Chaosmannerreviews.com.
[00:02:10.720 --> 00:02:11.720]   Yes.
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:12.720]   He's learning from Devorak.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:14.920]   You say it a couple of times it's people remember.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:16.880]   Jerry, it's great to have you.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:19.680]   Go early and often.
[00:02:19.680 --> 00:02:20.680]   John's learned.
[00:02:20.680 --> 00:02:22.960]   He knows how to plug it.
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:27.960]   I'm also still the lead columnist for Nikkei Business Publications.
[00:02:27.960 --> 00:02:34.640]   Oh, I'm still well known in Japan and oddly enough, Bite Istonboule still exists.
[00:02:34.640 --> 00:02:37.840]   So I am over there in Bite in Turkey.
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:39.520]   Is that the last print edition of Bite Iston?
[00:02:39.520 --> 00:02:41.760]   No, there are three others and I'm in them all.
[00:02:41.760 --> 00:02:43.760]   There's Riyadh and Brazil.
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:44.760]   Oh, yeah.
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:45.760]   Brazil's a big country.
[00:02:45.760 --> 00:02:48.480]   They're not big, but yeah, but they pay.
[00:02:48.480 --> 00:02:51.280]   Aren't you in a magazine in Brazil too, John?
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:58.000]   Yeah, I'm in info, which is the magazine published by a Brill, which is the big publisher.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:02:59.440]   Do they translate it into Portuguese?
[00:02:59.440 --> 00:03:00.440]   You write it in English and that's right.
[00:03:00.440 --> 00:03:01.440]   Yeah, they do.
[00:03:01.440 --> 00:03:04.160]   And then it goes to Portugal too.
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:05.960]   I have a translator there that's a genius.
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:10.760]   And so it's because I know a lot of Brazilians that I see them and they say they're fluent
[00:03:10.760 --> 00:03:15.720]   in English and Brazilian Portuguese and they say that the guy captures my humor just, you
[00:03:15.720 --> 00:03:19.720]   know, he does it right, which is a big deal.
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:21.680]   You have a distinctive voice, as does Jerry.
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:25.120]   And I would imagine that would be a tough thing for a translator to get that voice to
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:26.120]   come across.
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:32.120]   Well, it's quite interesting because if you know the Inquirer.net recently launched a
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:35.560]   bunch of foreign language versions and all the people in all the countries they launched
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:41.080]   into went absolutely mental at the publishers because they they taken all the Inquirer stories
[00:03:41.080 --> 00:03:45.960]   and just written them in sort of flat prose and just stripped all the English humor out.
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:47.760]   How do you be snarked to Portuguese?
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:48.760]   That's the...
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:49.760]   Exactly.
[00:03:49.760 --> 00:03:51.040]   It's very difficult.
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.560]   So I think a couple of stories that are very big this week.
[00:03:54.560 --> 00:03:59.080]   One that's really a developing story broken by Ed Bot at ZDNet.
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:00.520]   Ed is an old friend of ours, John.
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:03.480]   We used to have him on the radio show all the time.
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.480]   I used to write for PC computing as I remember.
[00:04:06.480 --> 00:04:10.040]   He was the editor for a while I think.
[00:04:10.040 --> 00:04:15.040]   He has an Ed Bot's Microsoft report at zdnet.com.
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.280]   We're going to look at the Windows Vista team blog and now at the license terms for Windows
[00:04:19.280 --> 00:04:22.960]   Vista and come up with some pretty kind of stunning things.
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:28.480]   I think the one that is most annoying is that you can only move it once.
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:31.240]   If you have a new buy a new computer you can move it to that new computer once but the
[00:04:31.240 --> 00:04:34.600]   second time no.
[00:04:34.600 --> 00:04:35.960]   You also can only sell it once.
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:38.960]   It can't be resold after that.
[00:04:38.960 --> 00:04:42.480]   And also it's going to cause some major problems if you are a heavy up grader.
[00:04:42.480 --> 00:04:46.520]   Well yeah because you can only reinstall once.
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:52.000]   Most people buy computers with Windows installed but for those who build their own this is a
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   ...
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.480]   My experience with Microsoft, I'm not going to take the ... I'm not a big fan of this concept
[00:04:57.480 --> 00:05:02.360]   either but my experience with Microsoft over the years with these upgrades are moving the
[00:05:02.360 --> 00:05:05.800]   operating system, we're putting in a new hard disk or whatever.
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:08.880]   You do get the error message and they give you an 800 number to call and ...
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:10.880]   I think it's going to change John.
[00:05:10.880 --> 00:05:14.120]   I'll do a genuine advantage thing.
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:17.760]   Maybe but in the past you used to be able to call them up and explain what you were doing
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:20.400]   and they'd say okay whatever and they give you a code.
[00:05:20.400 --> 00:05:22.920]   Yeah I don't think that's going to happen this time.
[00:05:22.920 --> 00:05:29.200]   That was certainly my experience and Eric has had the same experience and he is forever
[00:05:29.200 --> 00:05:34.200]   turning them apart but whether or not it's going to change is what we don't know.
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:38.240]   One thing that is going to change is if you aren't validated with whatever the equivalent
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:41.200]   they're not going to call it Windows Genuine Advantage but whatever the equivalent is of
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:43.200]   this authentication process.
[00:05:43.200 --> 00:05:45.360]   Actually it is called Windows Genuine.
[00:05:45.360 --> 00:05:46.360]   Is it WGA still?
[00:05:46.360 --> 00:05:47.360]   Yeah absolutely.
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:52.640]   So if you don't validate all of a sudden the only thing you can do is surf for one hour
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:53.640]   and that's it.
[00:05:53.640 --> 00:05:58.520]   Vista suddenly loses all its capabilities and it sounds to me like they're getting pretty
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:00.000]   serious about this.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.120]   Yeah but I think that's not quite right.
[00:06:02.120 --> 00:06:05.920]   It's not that drastic.
[00:06:05.920 --> 00:06:12.800]   What I think is what happens to you if you never activated it at all.
[00:06:12.800 --> 00:06:18.680]   There are degrees of what happens but if you have activated it successfully the first
[00:06:18.680 --> 00:06:23.960]   time it doesn't just shut down and die on you that way.
[00:06:23.960 --> 00:06:27.560]   It shuts down somewhat more gracefully than that.
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:32.360]   I'm confused then and I guess we're just going to have to wait and see what happens.
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:36.720]   There was some talk also about it not running or not being allowed to run virtual machines
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:40.200]   unless you have the ultimate edition but that's been pulled out of all the articles,
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:45.160]   the Techway of article and Ed's article so I'm thinking that maybe that changed or something.
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:51.280]   Well I tried to get, I tried to call Microsoft and get them to comment on this last week
[00:06:51.280 --> 00:06:57.880]   last Friday and there was nobody, nobody available to comment on the news.
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:02.760]   That's the period that there's going to be because I know quite a few people at Microsoft
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:09.920]   and usually somebody will at least say something to me and there seems to be either confusion
[00:07:09.920 --> 00:07:14.680]   or they've been told be quiet because the Wag Ed girls are not talking about it either.
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:16.720]   Thank you for calling Microsoft.com.
[00:07:16.720 --> 00:07:20.760]   We're all busy trying to get windows out before October 25th but we'll call you back
[00:07:20.760 --> 00:07:21.760]   next year.
[00:07:21.760 --> 00:07:26.360]   I know what that says to me that that whole thing says that the policy is not set in stone.
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:27.360]   I believe that's the thing.
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.680]   They may be testing the waters.
[00:07:28.680 --> 00:07:29.680]   This is a trial balloon.
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:32.520]   Well I mean they're probably getting bad feedback.
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:34.720]   They don't need this kind of agony.
[00:07:34.720 --> 00:07:35.720]   That's right.
[00:07:35.720 --> 00:07:39.640]   I think the question though is they're getting all this bad feedback but does it really matter?
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:44.600]   I mean are people really going to leave, are they going to lose more than 5% of the
[00:07:44.600 --> 00:07:45.600]   ...
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:46.600]   Well 5% is a lot.
[00:07:46.600 --> 00:07:49.200]   It'd be a lot for Apple but it's not ...
[00:07:49.200 --> 00:07:50.200]   More Linux.
[00:07:50.200 --> 00:07:54.320]   It's not from Microsoft.
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:08:01.640]   Their problem is that well over 50% of the versions of Windows running in much of Asia
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:07.800]   and all of the former USSR are bogus and they want some of that money.
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:17.000]   But hearing after that Asian gold if it costs you 10% of the hard currency from Europe and
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:22.760]   the United States would be a disaster and I don't think anybody at Microsoft is so dumb
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:23.760]   that they don't know that.
[00:08:23.760 --> 00:08:24.760]   I think that's the risk though.
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:29.920]   I mean especially since we're seeing so many false positives with the current Windows genuine
[00:08:29.920 --> 00:08:32.080]   advantage.
[00:08:32.080 --> 00:08:36.000]   The new anti-piracy technologies I'm reading from TechWeb are Dubbed Software Protection
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:38.400]   Platform under the new program.
[00:08:38.400 --> 00:08:39.400]   This is what TechWeb says.
[00:08:39.400 --> 00:08:44.160]   A copy of Vista that's judged to be in violation of its license or counterfeit.
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:49.400]   The problem is with WGA, you frequently, even if you're honest and it's authenticated,
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:52.840]   eventually at some point WGA decides you're counterfeit.
[00:08:52.840 --> 00:08:57.720]   That's when after a set period the only thing you do is browse for an hour.
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:09:02.880]   Imagine the heat you're going to get from some company where 10% of its systems suddenly
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:05.800]   can only browse for an hour because WGA is broken.
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:09.000]   I'm sure there's a long warning before that happens.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:10.240]   Well that's the question.
[00:09:10.240 --> 00:09:14.920]   Not necessarily but you know this will be cracked by some hackers in 10 minutes.
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:15.920]   That's what gets me.
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:17.880]   It's not the hackers get around this stuff.
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:21.560]   It's the honest people who are, you know, I hear from on the radio show who say, well
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:24.960]   I don't know, I bought a copy of Windows but it says it's not legit anymore.
[00:09:24.960 --> 00:09:30.200]   It's going to make life a complete nightmare for sort of corporate system admins.
[00:09:30.200 --> 00:09:33.920]   So of course, Windows XP had this sort of whole corporate key where you didn't have
[00:09:33.920 --> 00:09:35.360]   to activate every machine.
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:36.960]   Are they abandoning that?
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:43.880]   Well they're abandoning it in favor of you don't have to phone up for every sort of activation
[00:09:43.880 --> 00:09:45.840]   of your 10,000 machines or whatever.
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:51.560]   But as far as I know what they're doing is that you have to set up a license server so
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:57.760]   that Microsoft gives you say X,000 keys and you have like a license server that handles
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:04.040]   all those keys and distributes them to clients that request them on the fly basically.
[00:10:04.040 --> 00:10:08.320]   And so you have got a dedicated key I think for each machine but it's not handled from
[00:10:08.320 --> 00:10:11.440]   Microsoft it's like via a proxy server that you set up.
[00:10:11.440 --> 00:10:15.760]   Is it possible guys that you could make this so draconian that the people would turn
[00:10:15.760 --> 00:10:16.760]   away?
[00:10:16.760 --> 00:10:20.520]   I mean what would it take to get people to turn the Linux or Mac or something else?
[00:10:20.520 --> 00:10:21.880]   Will people turn away?
[00:10:21.880 --> 00:10:22.880]   Will people turn away?
[00:10:22.880 --> 00:10:23.880]   Or they just not upgrade?
[00:10:23.880 --> 00:10:26.920]   Well that just won't move from XP.
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:27.920]   Exactly.
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:29.680]   You have both alternatives.
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:35.600]   If you want a new machine you're going to get Vista on it and it will certainly be led.
[00:10:35.600 --> 00:10:39.760]   This really only affects upgrades doesn't it?
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:41.280]   Unless there's this false positive issue.
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:42.760]   I mean that's really the question.
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:48.040]   Paul Therat who does our Windows weekly column has had yet another false positive.
[00:10:48.040 --> 00:10:52.400]   This time he knows it's a legitimate copy and he says he talks to people all the time.
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:10:54.600]   But what false positives?
[00:10:54.600 --> 00:11:00.480]   Leo is it false positive from a machine he bought with it pre-installed or is it false
[00:11:00.480 --> 00:11:02.160]   positive from a copy of?
[00:11:02.160 --> 00:11:07.560]   I don't know I'd have to ask him but he's I believe it's a machine he bought from Dell.
[00:11:07.560 --> 00:11:10.760]   I don't think Vista's installing anything.
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:13.680]   I don't know but this is Windows genuine advantage on XP.
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:18.240]   The point is that it works so poorly on XP that some fairly large percentage of people
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:19.240]   are getting.
[00:11:19.240 --> 00:11:20.400]   Maybe it's a false negative.
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:24.880]   They're getting dinged for having pirated software when they clearly don't.
[00:11:24.880 --> 00:11:28.640]   Well I think that one of the things that regardless of whether it works or not I think
[00:11:28.640 --> 00:11:36.360]   the calculation may be that if I lose let's say 5% of the market but I get 20% more revenue
[00:11:36.360 --> 00:11:39.840]   from the people who because there's a lot of people who for instance get one copy of
[00:11:39.840 --> 00:11:44.600]   Windows and upgrade it and then they might have it on three machines or four machines
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:45.600]   or something like that.
[00:11:45.600 --> 00:11:52.000]   If some percentage of those actually buy for every machine that would make a big difference
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:57.680]   that would make more of a difference than losing that let's say 5% of the market which
[00:11:57.680 --> 00:11:59.440]   I think is all really is at play.
[00:11:59.440 --> 00:12:02.000]   It's kind of like gerrymandering in politics.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.520]   We're talking about 5% or 10% of the market that's in play.
[00:12:05.520 --> 00:12:07.640]   I think the rest of it's pretty well locked up.
[00:12:07.640 --> 00:12:10.040]   We're talking about a lot of money from money.
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:13.800]   We're talking a lot of money if they lose that percentage but what if it's offset by
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:17.920]   more people who are kind of in this gray area where they're using more copies than they
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:18.920]   own.
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:20.520]   Who would those people be?
[00:12:20.520 --> 00:12:21.520]   Who would those people be?
[00:12:21.520 --> 00:12:25.120]   It'd be a lot of little companies that have it'd be people with three computers in their
[00:12:25.120 --> 00:12:26.120]   house.
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:31.240]   It'd be a lot of little companies that have maybe 10 employees or five employees that
[00:12:31.240 --> 00:12:32.880]   they're spreading it around a little bit.
[00:12:32.880 --> 00:12:37.080]   It'd be those types of people and it wouldn't take very much for a hour.
[00:12:37.080 --> 00:12:40.200]   I guess there's a few companies that do that but I don't think too many companies that
[00:12:40.200 --> 00:12:46.240]   actually make money for a living are running bootleg copies of Microsoft products.
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:52.120]   I would say that in a home environment where you have a kid and a couple of kids and your
[00:12:52.120 --> 00:12:56.960]   wife and you have all have a machine maybe one or two of them even a hand me down.
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:00.200]   That could be the case but I don't think Microsoft's...
[00:13:00.200 --> 00:13:01.200]   They don't care about that.
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:02.200]   They don't care about that.
[00:13:02.200 --> 00:13:03.200]   It's business not the care about it.
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:05.560]   I think that we're talking about small businesses.
[00:13:05.560 --> 00:13:09.640]   I know a lot of small businesses who don't buy any software.
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:11.560]   They have 10 or less employees and these guys...
[00:13:11.560 --> 00:13:12.560]   You do?
[00:13:12.560 --> 00:13:13.560]   They don't buy anything.
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:14.560]   They don't buy any small...
[00:13:14.560 --> 00:13:15.560]   I love it.
[00:13:15.560 --> 00:13:17.560]   They must really have good employee relations.
[00:13:17.560 --> 00:13:19.560]   Yeah, because one disgruntled employee.
[00:13:19.560 --> 00:13:20.560]   What?
[00:13:20.560 --> 00:13:21.560]   Yeah, yeah.
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:22.560]   You're out of business.
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:24.560]   There's that bounty system.
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:29.560]   I mean the software publishers association pays thousands of dollars on a percentage basis
[00:13:29.560 --> 00:13:31.840]   and what they can collect.
[00:13:31.840 --> 00:13:36.200]   They'll give it to somebody who turns in their boss and they have like 10 people in the
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:38.000]   company with one of them getting irked.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:42.920]   Like Jerry said within a couple of years and getting mad and then turning in the company
[00:13:42.920 --> 00:13:44.160]   to ruin them.
[00:13:44.160 --> 00:13:45.920]   It seems like an unlikely situation.
[00:13:45.920 --> 00:13:46.920]   I don't know.
[00:13:46.920 --> 00:13:47.920]   I mean...
[00:13:47.920 --> 00:13:48.920]   I've seen an entire game...
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:52.480]   I'm not going to get too much into detail but I've seen game companies.
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:53.480]   I think it's nuts.
[00:13:53.480 --> 00:13:56.680]   I don't think that's a good idea but I do know that there's a lot of companies that
[00:13:56.680 --> 00:13:58.680]   are like that and there might be a calculation.
[00:13:58.680 --> 00:14:00.840]   There are a lot of those companies and a lot of those people out there and then you have
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:01.840]   the entire...
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:02.840]   All of Asia.
[00:14:02.840 --> 00:14:08.200]   Maybe if they're like disposable companies or the guys says, "We've got to get this thing
[00:14:08.200 --> 00:14:10.120]   down and then we're going to shut down anyway."
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:11.120]   So what?
[00:14:11.120 --> 00:14:15.360]   Sue me after the fact, after I'm bankrupt.
[00:14:15.360 --> 00:14:20.440]   I would have thought your typical pirate situation was a guy who's got three machines
[00:14:20.440 --> 00:14:26.360]   and one of them came with Emi on and he put his copy of XP on that machine as well as
[00:14:26.360 --> 00:14:27.360]   on his main machine.
[00:14:27.360 --> 00:14:28.360]   Right.
[00:14:28.360 --> 00:14:30.800]   I don't think you're going to get a dime out of it.
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:33.600]   Out of that guy, he's just going to say, "They're hell with you."
[00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:34.600]   I'm Linux.
[00:14:34.600 --> 00:14:39.040]   Or I'll put Linux on that machine and be done with it.
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:42.600]   I just don't see where there's all that revenue.
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:45.600]   I think small shops should be switching to Linux anyway.
[00:14:45.600 --> 00:14:48.040]   Don't you just think it just drives Bill Gates crazy?
[00:14:48.040 --> 00:14:49.160]   It's always just driven him crazy.
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:51.560]   It's always been a hot button for him and it's just...
[00:14:51.560 --> 00:14:52.760]   I know that.
[00:14:52.760 --> 00:15:00.600]   I can recall when he was down here he must have been 18 years old and he was selling
[00:15:00.600 --> 00:15:09.040]   copies of Maltevista at Southern California Computer Society, basic Southern California
[00:15:09.040 --> 00:15:12.240]   Computer Society meetings over at Harvard School.
[00:15:12.240 --> 00:15:18.760]   It met over there and people would buy one at paper tapes and they would take the tape
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:24.120]   home and make a copy and come back and sell it for five bucks and he's getting 20 on his
[00:15:24.120 --> 00:15:29.520]   and I will tell you, you could see smoke coming out of his ears when he would hear about it.
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:35.200]   But there's a famous incident of him chewing out the homebrew computer club over at Stealing
[00:15:35.200 --> 00:15:37.200]   His Basic Tapes.
[00:15:37.200 --> 00:15:40.960]   Well he did with Southern California Computer Society too.
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:46.440]   I wonder if anybody from the Digital Equipment Corporation and their deck 10 basic ever complained
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:48.320]   to Bill about him stealing their basic.
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.320]   You think he stole it?
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:50.320]   Oh wait a minute.
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:51.920]   That's going to be a good story.
[00:15:51.920 --> 00:15:55.040]   You think he didn't write that sucker from scratch?
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.120]   It was Paul.
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:57.120]   Paul wrote it.
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:02.920]   Paul wrote it but if you talk to anybody back east they had a copy of the deck 10 basic.
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.080]   Yeah, they really looked at it huh?
[00:16:05.080 --> 00:16:09.040]   Well I can tell you, your code was available.
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:23.640]   I can tell you, I saw Gary Kildall take a copy of Doss 1, 1.1 or 1.2 and I could have
[00:16:23.640 --> 00:16:30.440]   written down what he did to get it and it brings up a copyright digital research corporation.
[00:16:30.440 --> 00:16:31.440]   Gary Kildall.
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:32.440]   Oh you're kidding.
[00:16:32.440 --> 00:16:33.440]   I am not kidding.
[00:16:33.440 --> 00:16:35.440]   They left it in the code?
[00:16:35.440 --> 00:16:37.440]   Yeah that's an endless code.
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:38.840]   Yeah that's the only thing.
[00:16:38.840 --> 00:16:42.800]   I mean this is not somebody told me this.
[00:16:42.800 --> 00:16:44.080]   Gary showed it to me.
[00:16:44.080 --> 00:16:48.840]   Yeah well Patterson when he developed the op-
[00:16:48.840 --> 00:16:49.840]   Seattle Doss.
[00:16:49.840 --> 00:16:50.840]   Yeah.
[00:16:50.840 --> 00:16:54.440]   He apparently, I've heard this story too.
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:56.440]   But it wasn't Microsoft it might have been Patterson.
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:58.200]   I'm not telling you what I've heard.
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:01.280]   This I saw, I was up there at Pebble Beach in Asia.
[00:17:01.280 --> 00:17:03.880]   Bill Godbelt said you got to come up here.
[00:17:03.880 --> 00:17:07.080]   Gary will show you something but he's only going to show it to you in person when I
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:08.920]   go and talk about it on the phone.
[00:17:08.920 --> 00:17:12.720]   And I come up there and by God there it was and it really popped it up.
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:16.120]   Which is why Doss 2 is so different from Doss 1.
[00:17:16.120 --> 00:17:19.360]   Doss 2 was written in a clean room.
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:29.280]   And it's also why if you own digital research Doss, DR Doss, you will never be sued for looking
[00:17:29.280 --> 00:17:30.280]   for you.
[00:17:30.280 --> 00:17:32.040]   I guarantee you you won't be.
[00:17:32.040 --> 00:17:37.160]   I don't know all the terms of the settlement with Kildall but I know that was in it.
[00:17:37.160 --> 00:17:38.640]   Ancient history now.
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:43.280]   Disney says we understand piracy now as a business model.
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:49.040]   A president of Disney ABC television group and Sweeney and according to Fortune one of
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:54.320]   the 50 most powerful women in business speaking at an event.
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:57.960]   She says we understand piracy now as a business model.
[00:17:57.960 --> 00:17:59.560]   Actually it was an analyst call.
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:03.320]   It exists to serve, this is really interesting, ABC Disney.
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:06.240]   It exists to serve a need in the marketplace.
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:10.960]   Specifically for consumers who want TV content on demand and it competes for consumers the
[00:18:10.960 --> 00:18:12.960]   same way we do.
[00:18:12.960 --> 00:18:16.960]   Through high quality price and availability and we get this.
[00:18:16.960 --> 00:18:18.960]   Hey where's the story Leo?
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:19.960]   It's from Ours Technica.
[00:18:19.960 --> 00:18:20.960]   We don't like the model.
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:24.120]   It's in the list a little bit farther down.
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:28.680]   But we realize it's effective enough to make piracy a key competitor going forward and
[00:18:28.680 --> 00:18:33.740]   we've created a strategy to address this threat with attractive easy to use ways for
[00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:37.600]   us for viewers to get the content they want from us legally.
[00:18:37.600 --> 00:18:39.760]   In other words keeping honest people honest.
[00:18:39.760 --> 00:18:42.800]   A very interesting admission out of Disney.
[00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:44.000]   Piracy is a competitor.
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:46.600]   I think that's a good way to view it.
[00:18:46.600 --> 00:18:53.640]   I thought it was fascinating that they finally had the co-owners to stand up and say there's
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:55.760]   another answer than just suing people.
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:56.760]   It's a Bolivian.
[00:18:56.760 --> 00:18:59.000]   It's an answer to the net.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:03.520]   The reason people pirate is because it fills a need that something people want and that's
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:04.960]   a big recognition.
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:12.480]   I think they have a big opportunity with piracy is rife but it's not for TV certainly.
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:17.520]   It's not really mainstream yet in the same way that music trading always was.
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:22.440]   They have an opportunity to really get these online services going which make it easy as
[00:19:22.440 --> 00:19:29.000]   well as cheap slash free and fast for people to get the content that they really want.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:32.080]   I think that there's a big difference between writing a press release that says that you
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:35.600]   really see piracy as another option and you respect it and everything else and actually
[00:19:35.600 --> 00:19:36.600]   doing anything about it.
[00:19:36.600 --> 00:19:38.320]   Well I like what she says.
[00:19:38.320 --> 00:19:43.920]   What she says is the best way to fight piracy is to give people attractive easy, in other
[00:19:43.920 --> 00:19:45.360]   words the carrot, not the stick.
[00:19:45.360 --> 00:19:47.160]   Attractive easy ways to get it.
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:51.520]   I'd barely compare the ABC way of doing that right now as attractive.
[00:19:51.520 --> 00:19:53.160]   I mean you're still stuck on the web.
[00:19:53.160 --> 00:19:54.160]   You still can't put it on the mobile device.
[00:19:54.160 --> 00:19:56.080]   No they're doing stuff on iTunes aren't they?
[00:19:56.080 --> 00:19:58.000]   Hey you guys missed this story here.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:19:59.640]   Ann Sweeney it's just ran.
[00:19:59.640 --> 00:20:02.480]   Ann Sweeney fired this president of the Disney Age.
[00:20:02.480 --> 00:20:05.120]   Over our dead bodies Ann.
[00:20:05.120 --> 00:20:06.440]   How dare you admit that.
[00:20:06.440 --> 00:20:10.200]   I think this is the most enlightened thing I've seen and it seems like the only way to
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:14.120]   go forward if you're doing business as a creator of content you've got to recognize
[00:20:14.120 --> 00:20:15.840]   it that's who you're competing against.
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:22.520]   I wonder who in her family got the letter from the RIAA.
[00:20:22.520 --> 00:20:27.560]   She says well it's hard to compete with free it's not impossible and I think this is kind
[00:20:27.560 --> 00:20:30.600]   of the recording industry is kind of coming to this point of view too even if they haven't
[00:20:30.600 --> 00:20:35.080]   made a statement quite like this.
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:36.360]   It's carrot and stick isn't it.
[00:20:36.360 --> 00:20:39.320]   The recording industry says we'll sue and we want to make the experience good enough
[00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:41.960]   so that you're likely to buy instead of steal.
[00:20:41.960 --> 00:20:43.160]   How about lowering the price?
[00:20:43.160 --> 00:20:45.680]   Hey there's a thought.
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:55.000]   She says the idea is to make it honest keep honest people honest make it easy enough to
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:21:00.120]   do legally and palatable enough that people who do feel bad about stealing will actually
[00:21:00.120 --> 00:21:01.120]   start to buy.
[00:21:01.120 --> 00:21:02.120]   I think that's sensible.
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:06.280]   There are a lot of people that will not download anything.
[00:21:06.280 --> 00:21:09.840]   Well especially if you're a little afraid that you might get sued you add that slight
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:10.840]   fear.
[00:21:10.840 --> 00:21:11.840]   It's not even that.
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:16.200]   My wife for example she has opportunities I mean you know but she refuses she buys
[00:21:16.200 --> 00:21:21.080]   CDs she'll listen to something maybe but then she'll buy it she refuses to she can't
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:25.200]   even wonder if you totally burn her a disk she won't take it.
[00:21:25.200 --> 00:21:26.200]   Good for her.
[00:21:26.200 --> 00:21:29.160]   It's got nothing to do with anything other than she thinks it's she just doesn't like
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:30.160]   that.
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:33.960]   She knows a lot of content people and she wants to she believes in what they do and
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:35.720]   she wants them to be compensated.
[00:21:35.720 --> 00:21:38.320]   She's an ethical person.
[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:39.320]   Right?
[00:21:39.320 --> 00:21:40.240]   It's something.
[00:21:40.240 --> 00:21:45.920]   There's going to be some limits she's married to John.
[00:21:45.920 --> 00:21:49.560]   Oh that's a good point yeah.
[00:21:49.560 --> 00:21:52.640]   Creative did an interesting thing with the firmware on the zen did you see this they
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:59.120]   just shipped a firmware update didn't say what in fact the only thing it said is in
[00:21:59.120 --> 00:22:04.120]   the notes section is adds language support for check Hungarian Polish and Turkish.
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:07.760]   Then down way down way down below in the notes there says oh and by the way disables
[00:22:07.760 --> 00:22:09.680]   all FM recording capability.
[00:22:09.680 --> 00:22:12.880]   This is definitely a great way to to get people to stop doing firmware upgrades.
[00:22:12.880 --> 00:22:16.520]   I mean I know that oh man there was there was some point where iTunes I think turned
[00:22:16.520 --> 00:22:21.120]   off our ability to it was there was a very early on with iTunes you know you could you
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:24.840]   could share with people in the office and they could actually grab your files you know
[00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:30.400]   between between each one and Apple you know turned on turn that off you know on in in
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:35.360]   one upgrade to another and I know that nowadays it takes me I probably don't upgrade my my
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:40.560]   firmware for my iPod or iTunes probably for six months at a time unless there's something
[00:22:40.560 --> 00:22:43.960]   real a really good reason to like things won't work anymore just because of that you know
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:51.320]   so it's a it's a great way to develop a great relationship with your with your customers.
[00:22:51.320 --> 00:22:57.440]   You know it's the long arm of the of the I just hate to see somebody disable a feature
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:22:58.680]   through an update like that.
[00:22:58.680 --> 00:23:04.600]   I have great faith in the ability of American corporations to batter themselves in the
[00:23:04.600 --> 00:23:08.920]   incensibility just about the time they are able to compete with Bill Gates.
[00:23:08.920 --> 00:23:14.520]   If there's a theme of this brilliant but he very seldom makes terrible mistakes.
[00:23:14.520 --> 00:23:18.920]   Well and I think that also if I was if I was an FM broadcaster I would I would want that
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:23.520]   feature to be there because apparently that's why they're taking it out though right because
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:27.360]   I know you know you think that but I if if I was an FM broadcaster I would want that
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:31.120]   to be there because because that means people actually listening to my show instead of downloading
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:35.680]   podcasts and music off of iTunes and everything else and listening to them over and over again
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:40.360]   you know it's well listening wants to record everything and then never again.
[00:23:40.360 --> 00:23:45.040]   Well maybe but but if I'm recording to my portable unless I'm really committed I you know
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:48.960]   the chances of like an editing everything out of it is probably yeah I probably I tried
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:53.720]   to fast forward through it but I am I doubt I would go through the process of editing a
[00:23:53.720 --> 00:23:54.720]   radio show.
[00:23:54.720 --> 00:23:58.920]   What do you guys make of this stock options thing now more and more CEOs disappearing Mac
[00:23:58.920 --> 00:24:04.920]   Caffee Cnet Shelby Bonnie resigning over the well that was a shocker to me post dating
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:08.440]   to Apple shot at C it's CFO as well.
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:12.320]   Yeah this is this is starting to really to draw some blood here.
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:14.440]   Why were you surprised that Shelby Bonnie resigned from.
[00:24:14.440 --> 00:24:18.200]   Well I mean for one thing I don't understand why he even was involved in this kind of a
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:22.800]   deal because he had most of the stock initially I mean he was like the founder of the company
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:25.920]   and the other thing is why did he have to resign why did you say look I'm sticking around
[00:24:25.920 --> 00:24:31.240]   I'm sorry this happened I don't understand what was the reason for the resignation I mean
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:35.160]   somebody's got to run that company it seems to me a guy like that's better than I mean
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:39.240]   just because he made some mistake that might be a legal issue I still see why I can't run
[00:24:39.240 --> 00:24:40.240]   the company.
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:42.040]   It does seem like a rather guilty admission doesn't it.
[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:45.920]   Well besides being guilty why can't he run the company under this circumstance I mean
[00:24:45.920 --> 00:24:50.120]   he's not the only guy in the world that's caught in this mess and it hasn't been fully
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:51.120]   resolved.
[00:24:51.120 --> 00:24:54.720]   Well let it get resolved and so he bales off from the company so they got like who's running
[00:24:54.720 --> 00:24:55.720]   it.
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:59.880]   I mean Shelby is one of the two guys and then it was Halsey's the other guy you know those
[00:24:59.880 --> 00:25:01.160]   are the guys that started the company.
[00:25:01.160 --> 00:25:02.160]   Now they're gone.
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:04.000]   Weird to me that they would just leave.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.840]   Well look at Mac Caffee they lost both their chairman their CEO and their president.
[00:25:08.840 --> 00:25:13.480]   I mean what is it required that they quit because they have their tit in a ringer.
[00:25:13.480 --> 00:25:16.120]   It doesn't make sense to me.
[00:25:16.120 --> 00:25:20.760]   You know I think that even the prosecution of this stuff doesn't make you know a lot
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:24.160]   of sense other than telling everyone we're going to start enforcing it and you need to
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:27.240]   you need to own up to whatever happened and then move forward because I think that most
[00:25:27.240 --> 00:25:29.760]   companies want to stay inside of the legal realm.
[00:25:29.760 --> 00:25:33.040]   I mean I look at the particular case that people keep on ringing up which is of course
[00:25:33.040 --> 00:25:34.040]   Steve Jobs.
[00:25:34.040 --> 00:25:36.560]   But this is all poor advice by one law firm.
[00:25:36.560 --> 00:25:40.680]   I understand and that's the thing and everyone was living in kind of this gray area and of
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:44.000]   course now we've decided that this gray area is now black and white.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:49.480]   But I think that if you look at who are the real victims here I mean the victims are usually
[00:25:49.480 --> 00:25:53.160]   the stockholders after people have been prosecuted and everything else not.
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:57.640]   I mean if they just owned up to it and paid some fines and called it a day that'd be fine.
[00:25:57.640 --> 00:26:01.280]   You know for most of the stockholders who are holding stock options or stock in those
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:07.840]   companies because now like for instance as someone who has some stock in Apple along
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:11.200]   with everybody else I don't have stock.
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:12.200]   I don't either.
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:13.200]   Well there you go.
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:14.200]   You're the only one.
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:17.360]   All I know is that my stock has gone up 1200%.
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:21.920]   So yeah well if we certainly make you feel good if they forced jobs to resign wouldn't
[00:26:21.920 --> 00:26:22.920]   it?
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:23.920]   No I'd be there.
[00:26:23.920 --> 00:26:24.920]   I'd be there on death threats.
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:25.920]   There was an Apple.
[00:26:25.920 --> 00:26:27.920]   So I'm getting it.
[00:26:27.920 --> 00:26:30.480]   Notice that who benefits out of all of this.
[00:26:30.480 --> 00:26:31.480]   Yeah the stock.
[00:26:31.480 --> 00:26:32.480]   Who?
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:33.480]   Who Jerry?
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:34.480]   Who Jerry?
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:35.480]   Who benefits?
[00:26:35.480 --> 00:26:37.400]   You talked about it.
[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:38.400]   Paying fines.
[00:26:38.400 --> 00:26:39.920]   It's the bloody government.
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:45.280]   The purpose of the government is to collect money and spend it on government employees.
[00:26:45.280 --> 00:26:46.800]   That's what it does.
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:53.360]   Maybe here's an insight into why all these CEOs are resigning the CEO of Monster.com Andrew
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:58.640]   McKelvey resigns saying he could no longer dedicate the number of hours required for the
[00:26:58.640 --> 00:27:00.640]   stock option review.
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:04.280]   Ah yeah it was just taking so long.
[00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:06.120]   He said I give up.
[00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:07.360]   That's what I was about to say.
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:12.360]   I would have thought that most of these guys look at it and say look I've got my pile.
[00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:15.080]   If they find me it is not going to be that much.
[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:16.080]   They're hacked with you.
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:18.560]   You guys out there you little stockholders.
[00:27:18.560 --> 00:27:23.200]   I was making money for you and look what they are doing to me for doing that and it
[00:27:23.200 --> 00:27:26.680]   ain't worth it because I'm not making enough to make this worthwhile.
[00:27:26.680 --> 00:27:28.240]   I'm going to buy a yacht.
[00:27:28.240 --> 00:27:29.240]   I'll buy.
[00:27:29.240 --> 00:27:30.240]   I think that's exactly the point.
[00:27:30.240 --> 00:27:33.000]   I think that the government needs to fit.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:37.600]   People need to really start complaining to their officials, to their representative that
[00:27:37.600 --> 00:27:39.640]   we should not be going down this path.
[00:27:39.640 --> 00:27:41.680]   The government should not be going down this path.
[00:27:41.680 --> 00:27:45.480]   They should not be threatening people with going to JL chasing them around to Africa,
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:51.400]   doing all that stuff because it's let them pay their fines but don't make it a capital
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:52.400]   offense.
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:53.400]   How about this one?
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:54.400]   That's the silliness.
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:28:03.040]   This is raising eyebrows, CEO of HP Mark Hurd, just about a week before the HP spy scandal
[00:28:03.040 --> 00:28:04.200]   became public.
[00:28:04.200 --> 00:28:06.200]   Oh god what's it?
[00:28:06.200 --> 00:28:09.040]   He sold $1.4 million in stock options.
[00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:15.320]   Actually sold many more but he made $1.4 million in stock options one week before the investigation
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:17.880]   got the lid blew blow off of it.
[00:28:17.880 --> 00:28:18.880]   What do you think?
[00:28:18.880 --> 00:28:25.880]   That would be more controversial if HP share price actually moved in the last few weeks.
[00:28:25.880 --> 00:28:27.960]   But the market is so non-class.
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:29.680]   It went down a little bit didn't it?
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:32.400]   It didn't amount to a hillbilly.
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:36.920]   And I think also you have to put into context that HP evidently for their management only
[00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:41.600]   has a three-week window every quarter that he's been in stock and he sold it inside of
[00:28:41.600 --> 00:28:42.600]   that window.
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:49.600]   It's not necessarily, you know, if you're trying to start the partner.
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:53.000]   Talk to you that HP has been beaten about the head and shoulders.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   He has not.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   No.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:56.000]   Quite deservedly.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:59.400]   My favorite thing if anybody got to see Carly Fiorina on 60 Minutes.
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.400]   Oh she was just a travesty.
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:08.400]   And she came up after Patricia Dunn came out to wine and moan and groan about Tom Perkins
[00:29:08.400 --> 00:29:14.120]   and his pal and then Carly comes up moaning and groaning about the same two guys and it's
[00:29:14.120 --> 00:29:17.680]   like the whole thing and Carly was really defensive and she went on and on in such a
[00:29:17.680 --> 00:29:21.400]   way that one thing that these guys never brought, what was her golden parachute?
[00:29:21.400 --> 00:29:23.760]   You know she's complaining about it.
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:25.960]   She had a huge, didn't she get a huge, huge, huge.
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:29.400]   It was huge and now she's never going to get hired anywhere after writing that tell-all
[00:29:29.400 --> 00:29:30.400]   book.
[00:29:30.400 --> 00:29:31.400]   She doesn't care.
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:32.960]   It's somebody in Hollywood going to bed with everyone.
[00:29:32.960 --> 00:29:33.960]   Why does she care?
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:34.960]   She's getting married.
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:35.960]   Why does she care?
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:39.760]   I mean, well at this point it sounds like she's trying to save her legacy, right?
[00:29:39.760 --> 00:29:44.160]   She wants to- She's an egomaniac.
[00:29:44.160 --> 00:29:49.160]   I never saw a CEO get that much publicity for being CEO.
[00:29:49.160 --> 00:29:50.160]   It's kind of interesting.
[00:29:50.160 --> 00:29:53.960]   There are many ways the celebrities of the- They're not supposed to- They're not supposed
[00:29:53.960 --> 00:29:57.120]   to be CEOs and they're supposed to be stars.
[00:29:57.120 --> 00:30:01.720]   I mean Jack Welch was the only guy who ever made a big stink about being the CEO and look
[00:30:01.720 --> 00:30:07.080]   at poor guys like you know, he had all kinds of perks torn away from him and he didn't
[00:30:07.080 --> 00:30:08.080]   help him.
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:09.680]   Yeah, I knew Dave Packard.
[00:30:09.680 --> 00:30:14.480]   He didn't seem to want to run out and show everybody how he was in charge.
[00:30:14.480 --> 00:30:15.480]   He had the name.
[00:30:15.480 --> 00:30:18.280]   We're talking of controversies.
[00:30:18.280 --> 00:30:20.200]   We should have the John C. de Vorac.
[00:30:20.200 --> 00:30:21.640]   I was wrong addition.
[00:30:21.640 --> 00:30:22.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:30:22.640 --> 00:30:25.880]   People's never going to buy you.
[00:30:25.880 --> 00:30:26.880]   You've seen.
[00:30:26.880 --> 00:30:27.880]   You've forgotten about that.
[00:30:27.880 --> 00:30:29.520]   You guys are just mean to me.
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:31.040]   So now okay, let me defend myself.
[00:30:31.040 --> 00:30:32.040]   What was it John?
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:33.760]   Yeah, last week or two.
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:38.560]   I said no way that Google was going to buy YouTube and I had a good laundry list of reasons.
[00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:39.560]   And 12 hours later.
[00:30:39.560 --> 00:30:41.600]   12 hours later I got bought.
[00:30:41.600 --> 00:30:45.160]   Of course I got a bunch of notes from various people who think you know are still irked
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:48.480]   about the 16 reasons the Macintosh may fail column.
[00:30:48.480 --> 00:30:53.240]   I wrote 1980 to the world whenever.
[00:30:53.240 --> 00:30:56.680]   So anyway, or there's a 1984 let's be correct.
[00:30:56.680 --> 00:31:01.720]   But anyway, so what happened was and I wrote, so I started to think about it and I started
[00:31:01.720 --> 00:31:05.720]   to do the numbers because obviously I was dead wrong on the prediction.
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:10.600]   And I wrote a pretty good column I think in MarketWatch which ran last Wednesday describing
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:14.080]   what I, you know, why they did it and why it may or may not work out.
[00:31:14.080 --> 00:31:19.280]   I mean, I still think it's that, you know, there's no proof of concept.
[00:31:19.280 --> 00:31:21.800]   Just because they did it didn't mean it's a good idea.
[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:23.600]   I think you made some really good points.
[00:31:23.600 --> 00:31:28.640]   One thing we didn't know at the time and I think it was key to this sale was that YouTube
[00:31:28.640 --> 00:31:32.680]   would make these deals with the record companies settling, you know, the lawsuits and making.
[00:31:32.680 --> 00:31:33.680]   Right.
[00:31:33.680 --> 00:31:37.080]   Now you're looking in hindsight everyone now believes that that was actually part of the
[00:31:37.080 --> 00:31:38.080]   deal itself.
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:39.080]   Must have been.
[00:31:39.080 --> 00:31:40.080]   Yeah.
[00:31:40.080 --> 00:31:42.480]   And maybe Google was involved in those deals to get something.
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.480]   I think what was the liability?
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:51.400]   What was absolutely, I mean, hilarious in some ways was that on Friday the rumors were kicking
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:53.960]   off, you know, that Google was going to buy YouTube.
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:32:01.440]   The stock, the market cap of the company went up by 4 billion because of all the stock
[00:32:01.440 --> 00:32:03.520]   rises on that news.
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:06.120]   And then of course they made the rumors, sent it up 4 billion.
[00:32:06.120 --> 00:32:09.200]   They bought it 1.6 and made a net 2.4.
[00:32:09.200 --> 00:32:13.000]   That's a very interesting point.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:14.640]   That is very well.
[00:32:14.640 --> 00:32:15.640]   Yeah.
[00:32:15.640 --> 00:32:16.640]   Well done.
[00:32:16.640 --> 00:32:17.640]   It's a profit deal.
[00:32:17.640 --> 00:32:19.240]   It could have gone up 4 or 2.
[00:32:19.240 --> 00:32:21.120]   I mean, come on.
[00:32:21.120 --> 00:32:28.240]   I mean, Paul Allen had a great quote which was, no, sorry, Paul Allen, Steve, Steve Bulmer,
[00:32:28.240 --> 00:32:35.440]   which was, if you believe YouTube is the future of TV, then it's totally worth all of my--
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:36.440]   That's a deal.
[00:32:36.440 --> 00:32:40.640]   If you don't believe it's the future of TV, then what are you doing?
[00:32:40.640 --> 00:32:41.640]   Right.
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:45.680]   I think it's a gamble on Google's part and I think they felt they could afford to gamble.
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:50.680]   And I think that it's a-- I don't think it has to be the future of TV for it to be a good
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:51.680]   investment.
[00:32:51.680 --> 00:32:57.200]   I think that you're looking at-- Google can definitely make money on the number of page
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:59.200]   views that are going on on YouTube.
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:04.680]   Those page views-- I did the calculation on a page view value of a page like a YouTube
[00:33:04.680 --> 00:33:08.800]   page which would-- if it was done on just an old $10 per thousand cost per thousand basis,
[00:33:08.800 --> 00:33:12.120]   it would be a penny a page and they do 100 million pages a day.
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:17.120]   So you can figure out that they can make-- it's a million dollars essentially a day which
[00:33:17.120 --> 00:33:20.960]   over a year 300 and then it doesn't take long to pay for this entire investment.
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:24.480]   But they've never proven they can make a penny a page from this and they're going to have
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:26.000]   so much inventory.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:30.880]   I mean it's not as though-- it's like magazines at some point when they get to be so large
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:36.280]   that cost to advertise in them is prohibitive and they don't do well.
[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:37.280]   Well then there's another--
[00:33:37.280 --> 00:33:39.080]   Yeah, it's so big about that one.
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:40.080]   Yeah.
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:41.080]   There's another issue--
[00:33:41.080 --> 00:33:45.920]   Sorry, but Google's getting so big that it's like I don't see how it's going to be like
[00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:46.920]   Yahoo!
[00:33:46.920 --> 00:33:48.560]   There's going to be a lot of page with no advertising.
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:49.560]   Just giving it away.
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:54.920]   There's another issue at stake which is that in order to do this deal, YouTube had to also
[00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:59.320]   agree to implement technology that would make it very easy for copyright holders to find
[00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:03.160]   copyright violations, pull this stuff off almost instantly using some sort of water
[00:34:03.160 --> 00:34:04.160]   marking technique.
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:05.920]   And an analyst raised a very good point.
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:09.800]   If you take all the good juicy copyrighted stuff off YouTube, does anybody go visit it
[00:34:09.800 --> 00:34:10.800]   anymore?
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:14.680]   Most of the stuff-- I think most of the good stuff is not copyrighted.
[00:34:14.680 --> 00:34:15.680]   I think when it started--
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:20.720]   I had another question technologically, can the net support that much upload?
[00:34:20.720 --> 00:34:25.320]   There's lots of download capacity but I don't know that many people who have all that upload
[00:34:25.320 --> 00:34:26.320]   capability.
[00:34:26.320 --> 00:34:29.320]   Well don't start talking about tubes now, Jerry.
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:32.880]   I have loads of that thing all the time.
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:34.800]   It doesn't take that long.
[00:34:34.800 --> 00:34:37.160]   I think they have a-- you know, they only will take exome--
[00:34:37.160 --> 00:34:38.520]   That's a hundred megabytes.
[00:34:38.520 --> 00:34:39.520]   So it's not even a--
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:40.520]   Or ten minutes.
[00:34:40.520 --> 00:34:43.560]   So playtime and a hundred-- if you have a pro account, I think a hundred megabytes is
[00:34:43.560 --> 00:34:44.720]   the top upload.
[00:34:44.720 --> 00:34:46.280]   So these are all short clips.
[00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:47.760]   I don't think that's really the issue.
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:51.080]   I don't think they'll have to take all the copyrighted stuff off because if they strike
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:53.880]   enough of these deals, then they won't have to worry about it.
[00:34:53.880 --> 00:34:57.400]   Well that's part of the technology could in fact, instead of pull the stuff down, implement
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:58.400]   some sort of pay scheme.
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:00.400]   And I think that's what they're trying to do.
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:01.400]   Yeah.
[00:35:01.400 --> 00:35:04.040]   But they have to monetize in the first place to pay the royalties.
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:05.040]   Right.
[00:35:05.040 --> 00:35:06.400]   I think these guys should be paying to be on there.
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:09.520]   I think one of the mistakes YouTube might have made, it's certainly what made it popular
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:12.080]   but it makes it hard to advertise it.
[00:35:12.080 --> 00:35:15.240]   Many of these YouTube page views are not really YouTube page views.
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:18.240]   They're embedded YouTube videos on other people's pages.
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:19.240]   Nobody sees it.
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:20.240]   Yeah.
[00:35:20.240 --> 00:35:21.240]   We don't have a handle on the number either.
[00:35:21.240 --> 00:35:23.040]   I'm almost guessing it could be as much as 50%.
[00:35:23.040 --> 00:35:24.520]   I bet it is.
[00:35:24.520 --> 00:35:25.520]   I bet it is.
[00:35:25.520 --> 00:35:26.760]   And how do they monetize that?
[00:35:26.760 --> 00:35:29.480]   Are they going to start putting pre-roll video ads in there?
[00:35:29.480 --> 00:35:31.480]   Or what are they going to do?
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:32.480]   Yeah.
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:33.480]   They said that that was a possibility.
[00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:38.040]   Chad, is it Chad Hurley came out for the first time saying that they might do that?
[00:35:38.040 --> 00:35:39.920]   That would be a disaster.
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:40.920]   Obviously.
[00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:43.120]   He said it was a bad idea.
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:45.280]   And on the day of the deal he said maybe that's one of the things that we have.
[00:35:45.280 --> 00:35:49.360]   I mean the problem now is that there's at least 10 competitors with YouTube.
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:53.240]   If I wanted for example I do it with the blog, I upload a lot of stuff and then I'll put
[00:35:53.240 --> 00:35:54.560]   it on the blog as an embedded.
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:57.680]   And even though it has a YouTube logo on there, people can run it for the blog.
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:35:58.800]   Why is it "revermore" to see that?
[00:35:58.800 --> 00:36:00.200]   I can do that with "put file."
[00:36:00.200 --> 00:36:02.840]   I would not put file but a photo bucket now has it.
[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:03.840]   There's a lot of places.
[00:36:03.840 --> 00:36:04.840]   Yeah.
[00:36:04.840 --> 00:36:05.840]   And they do the same thing.
[00:36:05.840 --> 00:36:07.840]   So if they start putting ads in there, I'll just go to photo boxes.
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:12.240]   Why do people not use "rever" where there's an actual, you know, you shared revenue and
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:13.520]   there's a chance to make money?
[00:36:13.520 --> 00:36:14.520]   Why not?
[00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:15.520]   Too much work.
[00:36:15.520 --> 00:36:16.520]   It's hard too hard to do.
[00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:17.520]   Too much work.
[00:36:17.520 --> 00:36:18.520]   It's so easy to do the YouTube thing.
[00:36:18.520 --> 00:36:19.520]   It's ridiculous.
[00:36:19.520 --> 00:36:20.520]   Yeah.
[00:36:20.520 --> 00:36:21.520]   People aren't trying to make money.
[00:36:21.520 --> 00:36:22.520]   They just want to put their videos on.
[00:36:22.520 --> 00:36:23.520]   Right.
[00:36:23.520 --> 00:36:26.800]   You may, like on the blog for example, if you want to make money, you can make money
[00:36:26.800 --> 00:36:30.000]   on the blog but you don't have to make money related to the video except the fact that
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   it's a video post.
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:33.880]   Hard to believe though that a website that specializes in guys getting kicked in the
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:36.640]   groin is actually worth three times my space.
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:39.600]   Well, this guy has gone too cool, hasn't he?
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:42.120]   To say that my space wasn't valued highly enough.
[00:36:42.120 --> 00:36:43.120]   Yeah.
[00:36:43.120 --> 00:36:44.520]   I think that looked in hindsight.
[00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:47.000]   I think it was conservatively valid.
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:52.960]   It was valued about $10 a subscriber which is, you know, kind of an old number but the
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:54.920]   Facebook stuff is more like a hundred.
[00:36:54.920 --> 00:36:57.840]   Well, nobody realized how much it would grow either after the acquisition.
[00:36:57.840 --> 00:36:59.720]   I mean, even Murdoch has said that.
[00:36:59.720 --> 00:37:02.720]   I had no idea what I was buying.
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:07.240]   So there was a story that ran last week about how somebody did some research and determined
[00:37:07.240 --> 00:37:11.800]   that the typical MySpace user, the average median age was 35.
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:17.240]   Well, you know, my producer, I just don't want to do the whole story but my producer
[00:37:17.240 --> 00:37:21.800]   came up with this theory at the cranky geeks producer, Analisa Savage.
[00:37:21.800 --> 00:37:25.320]   And when she said it to me, I said this has got to be the reason because this is something
[00:37:25.320 --> 00:37:26.400]   I do.
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:31.400]   If you look around on MySpace and you look at what people's ages are, the typical teenager
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:33.080]   will match it out.
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:35.000]   I do the same thing to 100.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.560]   Yeah, most of them are 100.
[00:37:36.560 --> 00:37:38.200]   But that's not where they got the number.
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:40.280]   It's Nielsen metrics.
[00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:41.280]   They're not.
[00:37:41.280 --> 00:37:43.600]   But where else would they get?
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:44.800]   That's the easiest place to get them.
[00:37:44.800 --> 00:37:45.800]   Oh, they do surveys.
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:46.800]   They do surveys.
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:47.800]   Oh, I'm not buying.
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:51.760]   I don't think that if they look, if they're stupid enough to get it from the profile information,
[00:37:51.760 --> 00:37:52.920]   then then forget them.
[00:37:52.920 --> 00:37:53.920]   I mean, that's ridiculous.
[00:37:53.920 --> 00:37:57.560]   Well, how else you're going to get the 35 average ages 35 means it must be a bunch of
[00:37:57.560 --> 00:37:58.920]   70 year olds on them.
[00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:00.840]   I'm not buying it.
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:02.360]   We talked about it last week and you're right.
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:03.360]   It's a little bit suspicious.
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:04.360]   I don't know.
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:06.760]   And once we talked about it last week, I got a lot of emails.
[00:38:06.760 --> 00:38:09.680]   Analyze is not the only person to point out, well, they're just, you know, everybody lies
[00:38:09.680 --> 00:38:10.680]   on there.
[00:38:10.680 --> 00:38:11.680]   But I just don't.
[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:18.600]   What kind of that's not any way to do any metrics is to look at the read the profiles
[00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:19.600]   of the users.
[00:38:19.600 --> 00:38:21.800]   What do magazines do when they send out their survey?
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:22.800]   They just ask people.
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:26.600]   And then they go to their advertisers and say, look, we're all our guys are CEOs.
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:27.600]   What do they do?
[00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:28.600]   They're not calling me.
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:32.600]   They do $8 million a year worth of business at least.
[00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:33.600]   Yes.
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:39.000]   You know, I never was able to get that free copy of the magazines by Lion in there.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   They have some.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   You don't know how to do it.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.800]   You told me that there's some way to fill out that.
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:43.800]   Not doesn't matter.
[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:46.600]   Nobody wants you weak anymore anyway, but it seemed like.
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:47.600]   Hey.
[00:38:47.600 --> 00:38:50.800]   Hey, where is Spencer the cat now?
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:51.800]   Anyway, is he drunk somewhere?
[00:38:51.800 --> 00:38:52.800]   I don't know.
[00:38:52.800 --> 00:38:53.800]   I don't read.
[00:38:53.800 --> 00:38:56.200]   What was the, what was the name of that magazine?
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:57.200]   The giveaway?
[00:38:57.200 --> 00:38:58.200]   It was PC week.
[00:38:58.200 --> 00:38:59.200]   Yeah.
[00:38:59.200 --> 00:39:00.200]   Used to be dominant.
[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:01.200]   Yeah.
[00:39:01.200 --> 00:39:05.880]   I think things change when they have different managers come in and change names and things.
[00:39:05.880 --> 00:39:06.880]   Never could get a free copy.
[00:39:06.880 --> 00:39:10.400]   They had one guy came through and he changed the name of PC computing to smart business
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:12.320]   and it folded like six months later.
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:13.840]   What a bad idea that was.
[00:39:13.840 --> 00:39:16.000]   It's like the stupidest thing I've ever seen.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.920]   Oh, bad idea.
[00:39:17.920 --> 00:39:19.160]   And now he's at Forbes.
[00:39:19.160 --> 00:39:23.400]   Speaking of bad ideas, the US government is banning gambling.
[00:39:23.400 --> 00:39:26.200]   Let's talk to our friend from over the pond.
[00:39:26.200 --> 00:39:27.720]   How do they feel in England about all of this?
[00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:31.600]   Are they laughing at us?
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:35.200]   You mean banning on line for the numerous other things that the US does.
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:39.280]   Well, there's many other things too, but let's talk about online gambling for a moment.
[00:39:39.280 --> 00:39:44.360]   The US Congress said it's illegal for companies to accept internet wagers or for banks to
[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:47.240]   process payments for online gaming companies.
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:51.280]   But the reason, did you see they sneaked it in basically in a terrible bill?
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:52.280]   Yeah.
[00:39:52.280 --> 00:39:54.080]   Well, it's, which, which seemed amazing.
[00:39:54.080 --> 00:39:57.280]   And they basically lumping in people who are spending money on online gambling with people
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:39:59.160]   who are spending money funding terrorism.
[00:39:59.160 --> 00:40:00.760]   Well, no, we've called this for a while.
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:02.360]   This has always been the case.
[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:04.400]   That and cigarettes without cigarette tax.
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:07.440]   It's all the fun terrorism.
[00:40:07.440 --> 00:40:17.480]   So I think it was, it's almost unbelievable that the entire internet gaming system is
[00:40:17.480 --> 00:40:18.480]   going to get shut down.
[00:40:18.480 --> 00:40:21.560]   A lot of these companies are British companies.
[00:40:21.560 --> 00:40:26.840]   So well, I think a couple of them are, but I think like the party, well, party poker is,
[00:40:26.840 --> 00:40:27.840]   I think, isn't it?
[00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:28.840]   Yeah, I think a lot.
[00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:29.840]   Now one, one British company.
[00:40:29.840 --> 00:40:31.560]   But it's the end of American revenue.
[00:40:31.560 --> 00:40:32.560]   Right.
[00:40:32.560 --> 00:40:38.400]   It'll end on American revenue if they can't accept new American subscribers when they're
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:39.400]   stuffed.
[00:40:39.400 --> 00:40:44.400]   One British company, a poker stars says we're not going out of business because we don't
[00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:46.200]   think poker is gambling.
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:48.560]   It's a skill.
[00:40:48.560 --> 00:40:50.200]   It's a game of skill.
[00:40:50.200 --> 00:40:51.400]   That's what they say.
[00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:56.360]   That's the California that it stud poker is a game of skill, but draw is not.
[00:40:56.360 --> 00:40:57.880]   Why would that be?
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:40:58.880]   I don't know.
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:05.240]   It's just legally in California, at least until recently you could have stud poker,
[00:41:05.240 --> 00:41:08.160]   poker parlors and that was games of skill.
[00:41:08.160 --> 00:41:13.560]   But if you had a loud draw poker, that was considered to be a game of chance.
[00:41:13.560 --> 00:41:16.120]   We have one of those places over in Emeryville.
[00:41:16.120 --> 00:41:17.120]   That's right.
[00:41:17.120 --> 00:41:18.120]   That's right.
[00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:21.400]   We got them in city of industry and places like that around LA.
[00:41:21.400 --> 00:41:26.320]   Seven million dollars of value wiped out last week by this law.
[00:41:26.320 --> 00:41:27.320]   I have a question.
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:30.000]   No, and maybe we'll know the answer.
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:36.160]   Now, if I opened an account in London and then transferred money to London and then
[00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:40.160]   used that credit card for that account, would I be able to gamble?
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:41.640]   That's the...
[00:41:41.640 --> 00:41:45.480]   I think you'd have a hard time opening the account in London because so open an account
[00:41:45.480 --> 00:41:46.960]   you need proof of residence.
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:48.240]   Oh, you have to be a record.
[00:41:48.240 --> 00:41:49.400]   That's not true.
[00:41:49.400 --> 00:41:50.400]   People do this.
[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:51.400]   I'm not sure that this is a common...
[00:41:51.400 --> 00:41:52.400]   That's not true.
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:53.400]   That's not true.
[00:41:53.400 --> 00:41:54.400]   That's not true.
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:57.400]   That's not true.
[00:41:57.400 --> 00:41:59.320]   No, no, no.
[00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:00.320]   I think it's true.
[00:42:00.320 --> 00:42:01.320]   I think it's true.
[00:42:01.320 --> 00:42:02.320]   I think it's true.
[00:42:02.320 --> 00:42:03.320]   It's true.
[00:42:03.320 --> 00:42:04.320]   It's true.
[00:42:04.320 --> 00:42:05.320]   It's true.
[00:42:05.320 --> 00:42:06.320]   It's true.
[00:42:06.320 --> 00:42:07.320]   It's true.
[00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:08.320]   I think it's true.
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:09.320]   I think it's true.
[00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:10.320]   I think it's true.
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:11.320]   I think it's true.
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:12.320]   It's true.
[00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:13.320]   I think it's true.
[00:42:13.320 --> 00:42:14.320]   I think it's true.
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:15.320]   I think it's true.
[00:42:15.320 --> 00:42:16.320]   It's true.
[00:42:16.320 --> 00:42:17.320]   I think it's true.
[00:42:17.320 --> 00:42:18.320]   I think it's true.
[00:42:18.320 --> 00:42:19.320]   I think it's true.
[00:42:19.320 --> 00:42:20.320]   I think it's true.
[00:42:20.320 --> 00:42:21.320]   I think it's true.
[00:42:21.320 --> 00:42:22.320]   I think it's true.
[00:42:22.320 --> 00:42:23.320]   That's true.
[00:42:23.320 --> 00:42:28.780]   fly for free. They're already pretty cheap. But when people asked, he said, they think
[00:42:28.780 --> 00:42:33.180]   they can make enough gambling revenue while you're in the air. You know, while you're
[00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:36.980]   in the air, average it out. Literally, you're sitting there on your little your little LCD
[00:42:36.980 --> 00:42:42.160]   playing online poker and there. Here's the question, do you do you have to gamble if
[00:42:42.160 --> 00:42:45.720]   you're going to fly? Or can you just know? No, it's a percentage thing if you know,
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:50.200]   two percent or four five percent or 10 percent of the people play and they all lose. And
[00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:52.800]   they all lose enough during the flight. I guess short flights are harder than long
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:58.560]   flights. Right. It's be great for like the long haul to Asia. Especially all the Chinese
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:43:02.280]   aboard who love to gamble. I'm betting they're going to take they're going to take a note
[00:43:02.280 --> 00:43:05.640]   from Las Vegas and make sure that everybody gets free drinks at the same time. What an
[00:43:05.640 --> 00:43:11.960]   interesting idea. I got to blog that. It'll be on devark.org/bloglookuprionair. We've
[00:43:11.960 --> 00:43:19.120]   just lost time for the next five minutes. So one of the one of the great old email programs
[00:43:19.120 --> 00:43:26.560]   Qualcomm's Eudora is going to release its last commercial version and then go open source.
[00:43:26.560 --> 00:43:31.120]   They're going to donate it to the open source community. I guess Mozilla Foundation will
[00:43:31.120 --> 00:43:38.120]   be the caretaker and it'll be kind of part of Thunderbird, I guess. First half of 2007
[00:43:38.120 --> 00:43:42.400]   we'll see the first open source, Eudora. Hey, this Ryan Air Story goes back to the last
[00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:46.880]   year in November. Well, it's okay. Is this a reference? I didn't think it was new. I just
[00:43:46.880 --> 00:43:49.680]   said it was relative to what we're talking about. You blog something like this and you
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:53.880]   get nothing but grief from over readers. I didn't say you should blog it. I just said
[00:43:53.880 --> 00:44:00.080]   I just gave a sack. We're setting traps for Devorak. Yeah. Setting traps. You know, I
[00:44:00.080 --> 00:44:05.960]   hear Windows XP is going to be out soon, John. Here's a story that I like. According to research
[00:44:05.960 --> 00:44:11.840]   sponsored by Apple. Okay, we admit it. A French consultant hired by Apple did a research
[00:44:11.840 --> 00:44:18.240]   and found that employees are much more productive on 30 inch monitors than they are in 17 or
[00:44:18.240 --> 00:44:24.840]   19 inch monitors. Oh, please. Like a Microsoft research report. And it's not even credible.
[00:44:24.840 --> 00:44:30.160]   I mean, I literally, I tried, I had a 30 inch monitor on my desk this week and I almost
[00:44:30.160 --> 00:44:36.080]   died of eye strain because not only, you know, you're sitting so close to such a massive
[00:44:36.080 --> 00:44:41.080]   panel, you literally have to pan your head. You do tilt your head to look left and right.
[00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:45.200]   Yeah. And you end up just thinking, Oh, my, you know, give me a small. I'll tell you what,
[00:44:45.200 --> 00:44:48.760]   I'll put this link in the show notes. If you want to get your boss to buy you a 30 inch
[00:44:48.760 --> 00:44:54.000]   display, I think it's actually true. You can have these windows all open at once and
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:45:01.120]   it's very easy to copy and paste and move stuff around. I like it. No, I, I've done
[00:45:01.120 --> 00:45:05.920]   I own for video work. You know, they'll say two monitors or two, but for two monitors
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:10.320]   is really a pain in the neck, you know, and and literally a pain is you swim. Yeah,
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:13.320]   you're still in a magnet worth. And then, and I really think the 30 inch lets you have
[00:45:13.320 --> 00:45:17.960]   a lot of things open at one time. I think that's the, I don't have, I have a 24 inch,
[00:45:17.960 --> 00:45:23.760]   but I have a, but the 30 inch who a lot of my friends have it. I feel like we're comparing
[00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:29.920]   here. My, I know, I know. But I have to say that I had one for, you know, a test for,
[00:45:29.920 --> 00:45:35.320]   for a couple weeks and it was, it was great. I just couldn't quite justify spending $2,000
[00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:39.880]   on it, you know, and which now I think is much less. I think you can get, not apples,
[00:45:39.880 --> 00:45:44.600]   but you can get one for like $800 or $1,000. The Dell one is pretty cheap. Yeah, $1,800
[00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:51.280]   bucks. Yeah. Yeah. So it's a, so, but I, I call that cheap. I do for 30 inches. Yeah,
[00:45:51.280 --> 00:45:54.840]   I do think it's, I think it's better than having two monitors. I don't think it'll add
[00:45:54.840 --> 00:45:58.240]   a productivity as much as cutting everybody off from the internet about three or four
[00:45:58.240 --> 00:46:01.320]   hours. That would work. That would work. But you'll never see an Apple study saying
[00:46:01.320 --> 00:46:06.480]   that I could tell you that right now. Get off the net. Well, might as well use this as
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:10.880]   a moment to recommend those Dell 24 inch monitors. This podcast brought to you by the
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:14.240]   good folks at Dell. What are you laughing at? I got to sneak this in here somewhere.
[00:46:14.240 --> 00:46:19.440]   I like it. I like it. But I do have to say this is a commercial because I'm not, you
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:24.400]   know, it's, it's the Brits will who get mad at me for sneaking the commercials in. Well,
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:29.320]   you're a sellout. They don't even like, you know what? You have to slipstream commercials
[00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:33.280]   and nowadays is the only way I believe that this can happen with television because it,
[00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:37.720]   the, the 30 second jump button. You have to, you know, but if you look at television back
[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:41.280]   in the 50s and Jerry's probably the only one here besides myself that remembers this,
[00:46:41.280 --> 00:46:45.160]   but remember the old Jack Benny show where they would be in the middle of a skit and
[00:46:45.160 --> 00:46:49.760]   they would start talking about some cigarettes. Sure. Yeah. Well, Dragnet to used to take out
[00:46:49.760 --> 00:46:56.400]   his camels and hand them around. Yeah. Well, we don't have, uh, uh, Laura Lard is a sponsor
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:47:01.200]   here. After that. We do invite people to go to the Leo's Pick page at, uh, at, uh,
[00:47:01.200 --> 00:47:07.400]   twit.tv/dell. Uh, and I, you know, I do like those Dell 24s. I think they're really nice
[00:47:07.400 --> 00:47:12.160]   monitors and the Dell 30 is the very affordable and everybody agrees. You know, they have a
[00:47:12.160 --> 00:47:16.200]   built in memory card slots and stuff. Anyway, we've got some great prices and great deals.
[00:47:16.200 --> 00:47:22.600]   Twit.tv/dell when you buy something from that page or click through that page to buy something
[00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:27.080]   on the Dell site. Uh, we get credit. So we appreciate it if you do that twit.tv/dell.
[00:47:27.080 --> 00:47:32.600]   This concludes, you may, you may now release the fast forward button. This concludes the
[00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:38.360]   commercial portion of this. And actually, um, the, the Dell 30 is far, far nicer than
[00:47:38.360 --> 00:47:42.440]   the Apple 30 because you can adjust the height. Oh, yeah. See, that's, that's something that
[00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:46.200]   they can't do on there, which is so important. I don't want to that size. I agree with you
[00:47:46.200 --> 00:47:51.000]   as well. It's very important. So let's go back to this comment that the Brits don't like
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:54.880]   slipstream commercials. What's the deal? But they don't like commercials at all. It is,
[00:47:54.880 --> 00:47:59.040]   um, it is absolutely the case that the sort of stalwart of the industry over here, both
[00:47:59.040 --> 00:48:03.200]   in sort of publishing and TV and things, is that you have this, this really, really,
[00:48:03.200 --> 00:48:09.720]   really strong, um, divide between your editorial and your sort of commercial advertising arms.
[00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:14.960]   Um, and so you, you always have, you know, if a publisher goes with a journalist, um,
[00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:17.360]   to go and see a client or something, you know, the journalist is it. Oh, yeah. No, that's,
[00:48:17.360 --> 00:48:22.360]   that's, that's, that's strong. Yeah. But I get, we've never had casting for God's
[00:48:22.360 --> 00:48:26.440]   estate. I get more complaints from the Brits than anybody else. Yeah. I think the thing
[00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:31.400]   is that we've never had in radio and we've never had on TV. Um, the whole announcer says,
[00:48:31.400 --> 00:48:34.840]   gives the advert, which I think is quite common on the radio. It's very common. And
[00:48:34.840 --> 00:48:38.560]   the only reason I do it on the podcast is because that's how I do it on my radio. Yeah.
[00:48:38.560 --> 00:48:43.160]   As far as I know, um, certainly nothing I've ever listened to has that over here. So it's
[00:48:43.160 --> 00:48:46.520]   just different culture. I guess sometimes, you know, I think it doesn't work a lot with
[00:48:46.520 --> 00:48:49.720]   radio. I think if you slipstream something where it's part of the conversation, I think
[00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:53.120]   it's kind of cool. But there is something kind of peculiar when you're listening to some
[00:48:53.120 --> 00:48:57.040]   talk radio shows and the guy starts talking about some kind of vitamin pill or how he
[00:48:57.040 --> 00:49:02.400]   loses weight while he sleeps because he takes some whack job pill. I mean, this, I think
[00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:05.760]   you lose all kinds of credibility or the, or the what's it want? There's one guy locally
[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:10.720]   who's got, he's been sponsored by some gold trading company. So now he's going on and
[00:49:10.720 --> 00:49:16.280]   on about how great gold is as an investment. The ultimate, uh, the ultimate one was, wasn't
[00:49:16.280 --> 00:49:23.840]   that that chap that was working for, um, the big American broadcast, who was, who was paid
[00:49:23.840 --> 00:49:28.400]   as the sort of technology. He was getting all these backhanders from Apple and guys.
[00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:34.240]   Hey, Jerry, you're breathing again into the thing. I think it's Jerry. Somebody's breathing
[00:49:34.240 --> 00:49:37.400]   and I think that breath is cutting off wheels. Say, say what you just said again, because
[00:49:37.400 --> 00:49:42.400]   I'll, I'll edit the breakup out. I was saying it isn't it the case that's one of the, I
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:45.720]   can't remember which one it was one of the big American broadcasts. No, it's had a technology
[00:49:45.720 --> 00:49:50.480]   reporter and it turned out he'd been taking all these backhanders from Apple and various
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:55.040]   people to mention their products on it. Yeah. Yeah. That was a while ago. Who was that?
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:50:00.000]   Well, yeah. Our good friend, Robin Raskin, uh, did a bunch of video news reports in which
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:04.880]   she said that the iPod was dangerous for kids and the, uh, one, they were being, she
[00:50:04.880 --> 00:50:11.560]   was being paid by a number of other MP3 company manufacturers, uh, player manufacturers. So
[00:50:11.560 --> 00:50:16.160]   that's pretty sketchy. That's pretty sketch. The problem is that these VNRs get produced
[00:50:16.160 --> 00:50:22.360]   and then run as news by a lot of local stations in the, in the States. Anyway, I, you know,
[00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:28.680]   what I would, Jerry and I have a philosophy, we don't plug junk. Right. Yeah. I mean, we,
[00:50:28.680 --> 00:50:32.400]   we've turned down a lot of advertising, uh, from people I don't believe in. I like Dell
[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:36.000]   and we've always used Dell computers. I thought that would be okay. But you know, I also tell
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:41.520]   people, look, you think John or, or Jerry or anybody is not going to say something now
[00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:46.560]   nasty about Dell just because we have a Dell ad on here. I don't think so. Yeah. On that
[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:56.680]   score, can I say that monitors a mine or the HP 2105 and a LSE 20 inch and I love them
[00:50:56.680 --> 00:51:02.800]   both. I didn't know much bigger than that. And, um, I, I get eye strain because I, I
[00:51:02.800 --> 00:51:07.240]   had, I can't swing my head back and forth. I like six or eight inch lines when I'm writing.
[00:51:07.240 --> 00:51:12.480]   I don't want longer line writers say that they don't want big wide screens. No, no,
[00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:17.040]   you could have a, no, you want to, you want the word processor in a window that's only
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:20.840]   a certain width, but you can have a big wide screen for other things. I mean, sometimes
[00:51:20.840 --> 00:51:25.040]   you might want to, for example, I would have like, uh, I have a couple screens and I use
[00:51:25.040 --> 00:51:29.360]   that, that HP 2, it's a very good monitor. Uh, but anyway, I'll have like the word processor
[00:51:29.360 --> 00:51:32.800]   and then it kind of an eight and a half by 11 boats sitting there and on the next screen
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:38.720]   over, there'll be the Dvorak.org/blog. You kind of just sit in there so it reminds me
[00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:44.120]   to blog once in a while. Yeah. I would have to start charging you for the plugs. Yeah.
[00:51:44.120 --> 00:51:53.000]   Well, the JerryPrennel.com, um, the only profit I make from this show. I'd plug my website,
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:59.080]   but it's down right now. Yeah. I, I happened to that. Yeah. What, not only what happened,
[00:51:59.080 --> 00:52:04.760]   but I thought you used DSL extreme. How the world do you get enough bandwidth to support
[00:52:04.760 --> 00:52:10.320]   them? No, no, no, no, DSL streams, my internet service provider. Um, but we have a hosting
[00:52:10.320 --> 00:52:14.200]   service. I used to have a hosting company called the Planet out of Dallas and they actually
[00:52:14.200 --> 00:52:18.560]   been very good for a long time. Um, we have dedicated servers. I have three dedicated
[00:52:18.560 --> 00:52:24.080]   servers and, uh, are they connected? What's their internet connection? Oh, they, they
[00:52:24.080 --> 00:52:27.360]   they're peered through four or five different people. They have big fat pipes. That's that
[00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:32.120]   all I love tubes. I think ultimately level three is there a, is there big pipe? But in
[00:52:32.120 --> 00:52:36.920]   any event, um, it was just a, you know, a hard drive died and didn't fix it. They screwed
[00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:40.760]   up, um, six hours later, I'm calling them saying what's going on. I, you know, my server's
[00:52:40.760 --> 00:52:45.600]   down. I don't, you know what? What it hurt and I apologize to everybody. Uh, what hurt
[00:52:45.600 --> 00:52:51.000]   the feeds because the feeds are coming off of one of those servers. And as a result,
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:56.320]   when it went down, um, you start getting yellow exclamation marks in your, uh, iTunes because
[00:52:56.320 --> 00:52:59.680]   it can get wind those weekly.
[00:52:59.680 --> 00:53:04.400]   Yeah. Twit.tv's up and it's fine and the podcasts are there, but if you're subscribed
[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:09.240]   to a feed, um, those feeds were down for it. They should be back up any minute. You know,
[00:53:09.240 --> 00:53:14.000]   the, it's funny that I, I went to a new hosting company. We've got the servers up. Everything's
[00:53:14.000 --> 00:53:21.320]   fine. Uh, but the feeds are through Leo dot AM, which probably is a mistake. That's the
[00:53:21.320 --> 00:53:28.760]   Armenian registry. And, uh, so I've gone to go daddy and, and they've updated the, all
[00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:32.800]   the other stuff is up to date. Um, but it's taking the Armenians a little longer to get
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:38.480]   Leo dot AM to point to the new servers. So the feeds will be down until that happens.
[00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:44.000]   And at that point, everything will magically appear again. You have, you own the servers
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:48.760]   that are at somebody else's low. No, it's not a colo. They own the hardware, but I, I
[00:53:48.760 --> 00:53:54.760]   rent, in effect, rent the servers. I see. So I don't know why, but I got the impression
[00:53:54.760 --> 00:53:59.640]   from your radio show that you actually will running servers in your back room at your
[00:53:59.640 --> 00:54:05.280]   house. That's crazy. You have to be out of here and to do that. That's crazy talk, Jerry.
[00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:11.160]   Okay. I'm glad to know you're not insane, Leo. No, no, no, but I'm, I'm probably stupid.
[00:54:11.160 --> 00:54:15.120]   I probably should be paying more for managed servers and somebody sitting there with a,
[00:54:15.120 --> 00:54:20.960]   you know, watching them carefully. I just, I, I just am cheap. So, uh, uh, I was responsible
[00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:25.240]   for keeping the servers running. Uh, the hard drive died. Nobody was paying attention.
[00:54:25.240 --> 00:54:29.560]   Uh, when it did, you know, had actually been kind of flaky for a while and finally died
[00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:33.200]   and, uh, it just took a long time. And then, you know, I put in a ticket and they canceled
[00:54:33.200 --> 00:54:38.960]   the ticket and there was just a snake food. So I, I've got the best situation in the world.
[00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:47.080]   Ron and Greg run this big server outfit for, for a lot of big customers, but they're big
[00:54:47.080 --> 00:54:53.080]   fans of mine. And I see that's the way they're nice enough to, to, to host mine and I have
[00:54:53.080 --> 00:54:59.320]   their home phone. Yeah. They take care of you. Yeah. Yeah. No, I actually sent a note to the
[00:54:59.320 --> 00:55:04.240]   planet saying, you know that the world's largest podcast network is now down and they,
[00:55:04.240 --> 00:55:11.320]   went, huh? So what's a podcast? So it didn't, it didn't, you know, I, uh, for some reason,
[00:55:11.320 --> 00:55:15.440]   when you and John, you've got so much clout when I try to, when I try to throw my weight
[00:55:15.440 --> 00:55:18.960]   around people, just, you know, slap me back down. We, we just have to, we have to put out
[00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:23.520]   the request that if anyone, if anyone who is listening to Twit is a, has their own hosting
[00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:26.920]   company, they should email Leo. No, no, actually, uh, I've already, well, in fact, I've got,
[00:55:26.920 --> 00:55:29.880]   it's really been great. I've, I've gotten many, many offers from a lot of different
[00:55:29.880 --> 00:55:33.720]   great hosting companies. Okay. But I was such an emergency. I didn't have time to wait for
[00:55:33.720 --> 00:55:37.480]   those offers to flood in and I, and I, uh, I found out, somebody sent me a note saying,
[00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:43.480]   you know, about a year ago, um, the COO and a, and a number of other high level people
[00:55:43.480 --> 00:55:47.560]   and engineers from the planet saw the, saw that the planet was going downhill. This is
[00:55:47.560 --> 00:55:51.480]   my old company and left and started a new company called Soft Player. And I thought,
[00:55:51.480 --> 00:55:56.040]   well, I'll leave with them. So I moved over to the Soft Player and they're doing the hosting
[00:55:56.040 --> 00:55:59.040]   right now. So far so good. But, uh, you know, I've, I've received so many good offers. I
[00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:03.400]   don't know what to do. I, uh, I kind of wish I'd had the, uh, luxury to wait. Anyway,
[00:56:03.400 --> 00:56:07.160]   everything should be, by the time you hear this, if you're hearing it at all, everything's
[00:56:07.160 --> 00:56:14.440]   fine. Yeah. If you can hear it, it's working. And if not, well, hey, uh, it'll, it'll, it'll,
[00:56:14.440 --> 00:56:20.000]   it'll, uh, be working sometime soon. So I've got a really interesting story last night
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:26.480]   with, by a complete coincidence, which was, um, I went to a party, um, and it turns out
[00:56:26.480 --> 00:56:30.920]   that an old friend of mine that I hadn't seen for ages is now working in Apple's legal
[00:56:30.920 --> 00:56:38.680]   department. Oh, are they the people suing? Uh, yeah. So he is working on the iPod. Did
[00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:43.320]   you ask him about, uh, about that? Yeah, absolutely. I was like, what the, what the hell
[00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:47.880]   is going on? So he gave me, so he gave me the load at. And it's so what's the story? Well,
[00:56:47.880 --> 00:56:51.480]   they're saying that they've got a trademark or the, you know, they're trying to trademark
[00:56:51.480 --> 00:56:56.600]   iPod. Right. Right. And that's their main thing. So anybody that tries to, any company
[00:56:56.600 --> 00:57:01.120]   that tries to do anything that sounds like iPod or incorporates iPod, they're going to go
[00:57:01.120 --> 00:57:08.360]   after. And we know hence the my pod, I think they also try to trademark iPod cast. Right.
[00:57:08.360 --> 00:57:15.080]   Right. That's the, that's the thing. And they think that, um, well, I podcast, I podcast,
[00:57:15.080 --> 00:57:22.360]   I podcast, and they think that podcast comes under is close enough to iPod cast that nobody
[00:57:22.360 --> 00:57:26.760]   could use it if they got this trademark for iPad. No, I'll never get any judge or jury
[00:57:26.760 --> 00:57:33.720]   to agree with that. That, um, the podcast is now become such a generic. So they're not
[00:57:33.720 --> 00:57:37.560]   going to get iPod cast. They can't, that they can't get it. So what they're trying to now
[00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:43.400]   do is go after anybody that tries to use podcast for themselves. Cause they're like, well,
[00:57:43.400 --> 00:57:47.520]   we can't have it. It's public domain, but we don't want other people to have it because
[00:57:47.520 --> 00:57:52.440]   then that starts to get too close to iPod. So they're basically trying to stop anybody
[00:57:52.440 --> 00:57:58.560]   else from having a name that will incorporate a trademarked version of podcast to stop other
[00:57:58.560 --> 00:58:01.920]   people having a claim over the word podcast. So if I tried to assert a trademark to the
[00:58:01.920 --> 00:58:09.280]   twit podcast network, they'd go after me. They might like what they seem to be, they
[00:58:09.280 --> 00:58:14.600]   seem to be over. Um, they seem to be looking at people with, with products or initiatives
[00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:19.120]   over right, but there are actual podcast. No, they box that was what I was being. They
[00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:24.360]   have actually gone after podcasters too. Yes. And say as long as you keep podcast, I
[00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:32.160]   do your name or, or if you know, there was a, there was a podcast called the pod fit cast
[00:58:32.160 --> 00:58:36.280]   or something like that. And they went after them. The thing is the point is it's a, it's
[00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:40.680]   a meritless pursuit, but there, but podcasters are small and aren't going to, they're just
[00:58:40.680 --> 00:58:45.560]   going to cave. Um, interestingly, there's a, it's been a, if you guys, if you guys are
[00:58:45.560 --> 00:58:52.120]   fairly avid gamers, it's been a bump a week on Xbox live for a, for new stuff. If you've
[00:58:52.120 --> 00:58:57.120]   got an Xbox 360, you can now get the demos of a FIFA seven, which is looking pretty nice.
[00:58:57.120 --> 00:59:02.680]   Tiger Woods, which looks spectacular. And the new need for speed and the new splinter
[00:59:02.680 --> 00:59:07.120]   cell all come out this week. So if you're into any of those, it's definitely worth firing
[00:59:07.120 --> 00:59:13.280]   it. 360. Is this anybody? I'm sorry, but does anybody but me find playing golf on a computer
[00:59:13.280 --> 00:59:21.680]   really? The epitome of dull? Well, that and bass fishing. And yet both are very popular.
[00:59:21.680 --> 00:59:25.880]   Actually, curiously enough, the bass fishing game that used to be on the say got dream cast
[00:59:25.880 --> 00:59:30.080]   that had a little fishing pole that came with that used to shake when you catch the fish
[00:59:30.080 --> 00:59:35.160]   would fascinated my daughter for we played that thing for, for six months. I think girls
[00:59:35.160 --> 00:59:41.480]   like the fishing games at what age. I think she was like, when did that dream cast come
[00:59:41.480 --> 00:59:47.200]   out? It's just yeah, eight or nine. Yeah, something like that. Yeah. My son, my son
[00:59:47.200 --> 00:59:51.280]   that still is nostalgic about his dream cast. He wants to take it back. He, we gave it to
[00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:55.520]   somebody who wants to cook. It's a great, it was one of the greatest boxes ever built.
[00:59:55.520 --> 00:59:59.680]   I agree. But did not a lot of that. That's really true. Yeah. There's a lot of good games
[00:59:59.680 --> 01:00:04.120]   though. Yeah, crazy taxi was worth the price of it. Crazy taxi. You can still get that
[01:00:04.120 --> 01:00:08.520]   on the next box and it looks exactly the same as on the dream cast. I was just playing, I
[01:00:08.520 --> 01:00:13.520]   was playing Aztec today, this week on, I guess on, here's the word thing, they just
[01:00:13.520 --> 01:00:17.240]   posted a, and I don't have it in front of me with the URL is, but they just posted a
[01:00:17.240 --> 01:00:24.200]   way to play Apple two games on Internet Explorer on Windows only. I don't get that that home
[01:00:24.200 --> 01:00:28.720]   to the ex control. Yeah, so they figured it all out. So literally every game ever played
[01:00:28.720 --> 01:00:33.560]   when you were, and I had an Apple to shop. You mean, crush crumble and stomp is now
[01:00:33.560 --> 01:00:40.920]   available. It's now available. It's now available. I love it. And I spent a little, I think this
[01:00:40.920 --> 01:00:44.920]   will come in. Chopper command. That was the best game on the app. Yeah. No, no, no,
[01:00:44.920 --> 01:00:49.760]   crush crumble and stomp where you got to be a monster and run around and burn down cities.
[01:00:49.760 --> 01:00:54.600]   Where is this Alex? Wonder. I want to play. I want to play. Let me find it real quick.
[01:00:54.600 --> 01:01:00.120]   Well, you're looking. What do you guys think of the fact that Transmeta is suing Intel
[01:01:00.120 --> 01:01:07.120]   over the entire X86? Oh, wait a minute. Hold on a second. No, it's a pannium stuff. I think
[01:01:07.120 --> 01:01:13.160]   with this close that tab. What do you think of the fact that Transmeta is suing Intel
[01:01:13.160 --> 01:01:18.280]   over the entire X86 line saying it infringes on Transmeta's patents? Transmeta has gone
[01:01:18.280 --> 01:01:24.520]   from being a great little company making low power chips to basically a patent company,
[01:01:24.520 --> 01:01:28.000]   right? Yeah, well, that's what they all in. You can't compete in this business anymore.
[01:01:28.000 --> 01:01:31.560]   You just become an IP company and you sue everybody. And that's what you have to do.
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:37.080]   It's a way to make money. Is there merit to the lawsuit? Probably. Transmeta alleges
[01:01:37.080 --> 01:01:40.880]   that Intel has made over a hundred billion dollars on the processors. It issues in this
[01:01:40.880 --> 01:01:46.320]   case. I mean, Transmeta is not that old. They must have acquired a patent. No, they
[01:01:46.320 --> 01:01:52.000]   had, they're not a young company. Well, I think that they had was, was they had
[01:01:52.000 --> 01:01:57.880]   some technology for low power chips. I think they're saying that some Intel's sort of
[01:01:57.880 --> 01:02:02.160]   the last couple of lines that have integrated power switching technology to, um,
[01:02:02.160 --> 01:02:06.280]   our speed step. They say Intel laptop. All right. They say Intel's speed step is an
[01:02:06.280 --> 01:02:11.560]   infringing. Yeah. I know about Pentium three, I think so. What I know about Transmeta is
[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:17.440]   that they really hurt the tablet. Really? He sees. Yeah, they, they fooled a bunch of
[01:02:17.440 --> 01:02:22.600]   people into thinking that they could use their emulation chip and it would work and
[01:02:22.600 --> 01:02:28.200]   tablets can't be that slow. Right. And as a result, a lot of people tried tablets and
[01:02:28.200 --> 01:02:32.920]   said they didn't like them. I love tablets, but you have to have a fast machine to, to,
[01:02:32.920 --> 01:02:37.240]   to make them useful. It's met a God in it too many times. Is it the, uh, hand trans?
[01:02:37.240 --> 01:02:42.520]   Transmeta got into too many tablets and it was just, it was incredibly slow. And everybody
[01:02:42.520 --> 01:02:47.320]   would say, if that's what tablet PCs are like, I don't want them. Right. And it's taken
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:51.840]   years for the tablets to recover from what Transmeta did. I don't think the tablets,
[01:02:51.840 --> 01:02:55.960]   they're like, we're going to take off Jerry. I mean, this has been a dead product since
[01:02:55.960 --> 01:03:01.080]   it was first invented. Yeah. A lot of people say that and you may even be right, but I love
[01:03:01.080 --> 01:03:06.680]   them. There are people who are tablet advocates and I meet them all the time. I bought one.
[01:03:06.680 --> 01:03:10.800]   One of them convinced me I was sitting in a, a plane next to a guy and I got off the
[01:03:10.800 --> 01:03:15.920]   plane. I bought an HP tablet and I have to say it's just, I guess it's, it's, it's some
[01:03:15.920 --> 01:03:20.240]   people love it and some people don't. It doesn't do much for me. Yeah. I can edit on
[01:03:20.240 --> 01:03:24.880]   an airplane, which I can't do with the goon in front of me as a seat. Oh, that's true.
[01:03:24.880 --> 01:03:30.520]   You can't open the thing up. That's true. And I, you know, and I can carry mine into
[01:03:30.520 --> 01:03:35.800]   a coffee shop and set it down and sit there and work on it without having to have a keyboard.
[01:03:35.800 --> 01:03:40.400]   Do you use the handwriting recognition, Jerry? But you got to understand it recognizes my
[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:47.800]   handwriting. You know why? Why? Oh, back in 1989 when I was in Moscow, there was a guy
[01:03:47.800 --> 01:03:53.880]   named Stepan Panovich who was writing, who had a company called Paragraph and they were
[01:03:53.880 --> 01:03:59.160]   writing a handwriting recognition program and he had absolutely no samples of American
[01:03:59.160 --> 01:04:05.880]   handwriting. So I let him Xerox about 50 pages of my notebook and Xeroxing under the communist
[01:04:05.880 --> 01:04:11.320]   regime was an interesting thing in itself. It took permits. So he did that and he got
[01:04:11.320 --> 01:04:16.320]   50 pages of my logbook and so if it's going to recognize anybody's handwriting, you know,
[01:04:16.320 --> 01:04:21.440]   recognize mine because Microsoft bought them and that's the initial engine handwriting
[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:27.240]   engine in Microsoft. Well, I wonder you love tablets. It recognizes my handwriting just
[01:04:27.240 --> 01:04:32.920]   fine. Well, I'd be more likely, I'd be more likely to blame you than transmitter for the
[01:04:32.920 --> 01:04:40.080]   failure. I think so. It may be a baseball. Oh, I've all. Yeah. How is your handwriting?
[01:04:40.080 --> 01:04:46.120]   Is it? Is it a good awful awful? Okay. I can't even read it. My tablet read it.
[01:04:46.120 --> 01:04:52.920]   My handwriting better than I do. Oh, there's some advantages. So I found it. Yes. It is
[01:04:52.920 --> 01:04:59.120]   virtual apple dot org. All right. And it actually works, although I can't remember any of the
[01:04:59.120 --> 01:05:02.120]   keys and I don't know whether it's, you know, I have some trouble getting some of the key
[01:05:02.120 --> 01:05:07.320]   strokes to work, but I'm surprised you even have a PC to play it, Alex Lindsey. I ran it
[01:05:07.320 --> 01:05:11.800]   on my on boot camp. Oh, so I, that's what that's what boot camps for us to do. Are there
[01:05:11.800 --> 01:05:18.000]   any dots or dashes in virtual apple? No, it's virtual apple. All one word dot org. I'm not
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:22.440]   getting anything here, but preserving a generation of apple to discs. Yeah, yeah, but see all
[01:05:22.440 --> 01:05:27.720]   those little discs at the top just click on like a we just click on a you'll see down
[01:05:27.720 --> 01:05:31.800]   below you are you you'll see at the very bottom you'll see the most important one, which is
[01:05:31.800 --> 01:05:37.280]   Aztec. But what about crush crumble and oh, let's look. We'll just look at the Aztec
[01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:46.920]   gun here at the very bottom of the a yes, go to the crush crush crumble and chop is there.
[01:05:46.920 --> 01:05:51.920]   Yes, I see it. It's there, but I'm on my max side right now. So I could. Well, this is
[01:05:51.920 --> 01:05:57.920]   kind of a wow. I find it nice. This is crazy. These people are in clinically insane. It's
[01:05:57.920 --> 01:06:03.320]   awesome. Why is that? Look at the number of games that they've done. They've done all
[01:06:03.320 --> 01:06:07.000]   it's amazing. Once you get it working, it's just doing all of them. All you have to do
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:13.400]   is one emulator and then you just take the discs. It's amazing. This is it. It's a little
[01:06:13.400 --> 01:06:18.040]   odd. How long ago did this come out Alex before before John found out about it this week?
[01:06:18.040 --> 01:06:20.920]   So I don't know how long it's been there, but I found out about this week. It was on
[01:06:20.920 --> 01:06:23.920]   like I think I can get away with this one. Dig or something like that this week. But
[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:29.720]   John, where are you going to look at? Blogging on the work dot org slash blog. I think he
[01:06:29.720 --> 01:06:37.960]   owes you some money now, Will Harris. I think he owes you $10 for that little softball.
[01:06:37.960 --> 01:06:45.600]   Good man, Will. As a note, it does require Internet Explorer on Windows. It does not
[01:06:45.600 --> 01:06:51.120]   run under just like the only reason to run Internet Explorer. That's one of the things
[01:06:51.120 --> 01:06:53.880]   you're going to see in the next couple of weeks. In fact, there was a little bit of
[01:06:53.880 --> 01:07:01.160]   a brew. It looks like Microsoft's going to push IE 7 out to everybody by a Windows update.
[01:07:01.160 --> 01:07:04.680]   And there was one article that said it was going to force you to install it, but it turns
[01:07:04.680 --> 01:07:10.760]   out not to be true. According to Paul Therat, you'll wake up one morning sometime in the
[01:07:10.760 --> 01:07:17.440]   next few weeks and your PC will say, would you like to install IE 7? And you'll be given
[01:07:17.440 --> 01:07:21.680]   it'll automatically download it, but it won't automatically install it. And so it's IE 7
[01:07:21.680 --> 01:07:29.200]   and R&N Firefox 2 will all be coming out roughly at the same time. What I find was really interesting
[01:07:29.200 --> 01:07:35.160]   if you're using IE 7, if you go to download Firefox, it says it's blocked the download
[01:07:35.160 --> 01:07:40.320]   because it can't prove like that it's not malicious. It won't download Firefox. Well,
[01:07:40.320 --> 01:07:45.000]   it will. You have to specifically go and say, yes, actually, you allowed download because
[01:07:45.000 --> 01:07:50.720]   this isn't Apple does that on everything. You know, Safari, does that any application
[01:07:50.720 --> 01:07:53.520]   that you're downloading from Safari will pay? It has to because that was a big problem.
[01:07:53.520 --> 01:07:56.640]   You want to download this. Yeah, that was a big problem. It was automatically running
[01:07:56.640 --> 01:08:01.480]   applications. Right. But change that behavior. But do you guys use Do you guys use Internet
[01:08:01.480 --> 01:08:05.800]   Explorer? I mean, all I use is five. No, that's the whole thing is I always, well,
[01:08:05.800 --> 01:08:11.720]   but 85% of the people who are online, according to most of these services, I don't buy those
[01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:16.760]   numbers and I have the numbers. I keep saying are 50% people use Firefox. Among the technically
[01:08:16.760 --> 01:08:22.920]   literate, it's much closer to 35 or 40% Internet Explorer. Most technically literate 70% of
[01:08:22.920 --> 01:08:29.800]   amused Firefox. Yeah, I agree. Yeah, just yes. You remember when Amanda went out to the
[01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:35.480]   park there in New York and asked everybody Firefox or Explorer? You're talking about
[01:08:35.480 --> 01:08:39.880]   Rocket Boom? Yes. And what did she put us through a zone? Well, somebody watches that
[01:08:39.880 --> 01:08:46.000]   show. Well, no, it was when Amanda was on. I liked it. You liked Amanda. She's doing
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:53.640]   a new podcast where she's going to go in across the country. Maybe she'll come to Jerry's
[01:08:53.640 --> 01:09:00.120]   house. I don't think Roberta would go for that. Hey, Amanda. Yeah, I'm not sure Roberta
[01:09:00.120 --> 01:09:06.560]   would go for that. Exactly. Yeah. Well, I'll just I'll send her a note. Drop her a line.
[01:09:06.560 --> 01:09:10.480]   One thing you sure not to have is Andrew Barron and Joe and Conlin will not be visiting your
[01:09:10.480 --> 01:09:17.920]   house in the near future. The new Rocket Boom. Anything else anybody wants to talk about?
[01:09:17.920 --> 01:09:22.160]   Any plugs anybody wants to get in before we wrap this up? How long have we got? As long
[01:09:22.160 --> 01:09:26.000]   as you need Jerry, what are you doing? We're done, aren't we? Chaos. None of you's. I think
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:30.760]   we're got done and maybe in another time for this. But I do think we ought to be talking
[01:09:30.760 --> 01:09:37.160]   about a net neutrality. Yeah, Jerry has done some research and wants to talk a little bit
[01:09:37.160 --> 01:09:41.360]   about it. You know, we could we can talk about it now or we could save it for another time.
[01:09:41.360 --> 01:09:45.920]   Save it for another time. It's not going anywhere. It's sure it's sure gone off the front burner
[01:09:45.920 --> 01:09:49.160]   though, hasn't it? I mean, people aren't really talking about it anymore. But lobbyists are
[01:09:49.160 --> 01:09:53.040]   still out there pushing it. And that's one of the things that bothers me is that we're
[01:09:53.040 --> 01:09:59.360]   dealing with legislation here and it's going to be shaped by lobbyists and the the user
[01:09:59.360 --> 01:10:04.160]   community isn't going to have much to say about it because we don't have any spokespeople
[01:10:04.160 --> 01:10:11.400]   in that in that big heavy lobby game. And you know, and the players are all on strange
[01:10:11.400 --> 01:10:16.760]   sides. The libertarians think they want to give the government more power over the net
[01:10:16.760 --> 01:10:25.520]   and it's just goofy. We need to put together a pressure group. Yeah, we could probably do
[01:10:25.520 --> 01:10:31.240]   it with this broadcast. I think the twit army is is is pretty strong. Yeah, I work something
[01:10:31.240 --> 01:10:37.120]   up. So what what what what should we be saying? Should we be saying we want legislation to
[01:10:37.120 --> 01:10:42.880]   protect net neutrality or we want to fight legislation to enforce something else?
[01:10:42.880 --> 01:10:48.440]   Let me just say this. Any legislation will have to be come out of a committee headed by
[01:10:48.440 --> 01:10:54.560]   Mr. Stevens talked about clogged tubes as the model for the internet. Right. Do you really
[01:10:54.560 --> 01:10:59.760]   want a man who believes that the internet is has a bunch of tubes that get clogged to
[01:10:59.760 --> 01:11:04.480]   be writing legislation? So what you're saying is no legislation should be I think none's
[01:11:04.480 --> 01:11:09.760]   better than what we then than than anything we're likely to get. I have to say the goal
[01:11:09.760 --> 01:11:14.720]   of the people I understand the people who think that there are things worth protecting. But
[01:11:14.720 --> 01:11:19.800]   I think the cure is far worse than the disease. I have to say I'm kind of an agreement with
[01:11:19.800 --> 01:11:24.320]   you, Jerry, after going back and forth on this, it seems that anything anything the government
[01:11:24.320 --> 01:11:29.200]   does is going to be a bad idea. I'm not going to be in I'm not in agreement with either
[01:11:29.200 --> 01:11:33.760]   one of the two guys. I think they should legislate net neutrality. You used the word they and
[01:11:33.760 --> 01:11:37.680]   you pointed Ted Stevens. But you know you could if you could put something together and then
[01:11:37.680 --> 01:11:41.520]   hand it to him on a silver platter that was written by the users that was written as good
[01:11:41.520 --> 01:11:46.400]   law instead of something that Stevens would dream up and get it to go through somehow
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:56.680]   or other like you know you could give everybody a court to do a machine in the country and
[01:11:56.680 --> 01:12:03.680]   and 10 gigabit bandwidth it would be a good thing too. But John, you know, we usually
[01:12:03.680 --> 01:12:08.600]   end a couple of hookers while we're at it. I'm not sure that I'm not sure that that's
[01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:12.880]   not as easy as getting legislation out of Washington that hasn't been not. Well it's
[01:12:12.880 --> 01:12:16.360]   probably the easiest to get in the core too is that's for sure. John why don't we do a
[01:12:16.360 --> 01:12:19.000]   triangulation? If we took the hookers to Ted Stevens place.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:22.280]   Maybe that might work. Why don't we do a triangulation on this because I think it might
[01:12:22.280 --> 01:12:26.640]   be time to do something in a little bit more depth. We'll do a special edition of this
[01:12:26.640 --> 01:12:31.000]   edition on net neutrality. Jerry would love to have you on it and maybe we can get some
[01:12:31.000 --> 01:12:36.960]   congressional type CFF that kind of people and figure out the real solution to this
[01:12:36.960 --> 01:12:42.320]   because I have to say I'm puzzled by it. I'm obviously in favor of net neutrality. I'm
[01:12:42.320 --> 01:12:48.080]   a feared of any government legislation like you Jerry. I'm afraid of any government legislation
[01:12:48.080 --> 01:12:53.520]   period. Well that's right. But John, you get them involved that's going to be bad. If
[01:12:53.520 --> 01:12:58.000]   you could write the perfect law John what would it say? I can't do it off the top of
[01:12:58.000 --> 01:13:01.440]   my head. That's the problem with writing the perfect law. It takes a little while to
[01:13:01.440 --> 01:13:06.160]   keep people together. John while you're doing it think very hard about what powers you're
[01:13:06.160 --> 01:13:12.040]   going to have to give them in order to enforce compliance. Who's going to get an FCC? I'm
[01:13:12.040 --> 01:13:19.720]   taking all the power for myself Jerry. If you start telling Tom Warner exactly what instructions
[01:13:19.720 --> 01:13:24.480]   they can write into their routers which is what basically you're talking about with this
[01:13:24.480 --> 01:13:31.240]   legislation. Are you not then going to have to be able to read those instructions? I don't
[01:13:31.240 --> 01:13:38.480]   think that you're coming from some really weird angle on this Jerry. I'm not in any sort
[01:13:38.480 --> 01:13:44.240]   of agreement with it. Unfortunately the show is over for today but I'm not buying this
[01:13:44.240 --> 01:13:49.560]   kind of approach to the argument. Good. We've just we've just gotten a taste of what
[01:13:49.560 --> 01:13:54.640]   this will be about and I think that would be worthwhile show to do so we will pursue that.
[01:13:54.640 --> 01:13:58.280]   A species arguments is what it's going to be about. It's not a species. I don't argue.
[01:13:58.280 --> 01:14:04.800]   It's minor not species minor based on technology which I understand. I can't wait. This is going
[01:14:04.800 --> 01:14:09.840]   to be good. Were you talking about getting a court to do it everybody in the country? I
[01:14:09.840 --> 01:14:16.440]   use that as the same as your argument if we could get this legislation through the Congress
[01:14:16.440 --> 01:14:22.320]   unchanged the way we want it. And you got about as much chance of that as you have of
[01:14:22.320 --> 01:14:27.000]   the other. That's all I meant. Well when you're getting your Google that you know at
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:32.480]   twenty four hundred bought you'll know the reason why. We will we will continue this discussion
[01:14:32.480 --> 01:14:36.880]   at another time but I think it's actually worth it. I have I am not sure which side I
[01:14:36.880 --> 01:14:41.840]   fallen so I think it's worth doing. John C. Devorek is at devorek.org/blog. Go there
[01:14:41.840 --> 01:14:46.080]   to play your favorite Apple games. As soon as he gets that post up. That's going right
[01:14:46.080 --> 01:14:52.720]   up. Will Harris at bit dash tech dot net and now the legal correspondent for Engadget.
[01:14:52.720 --> 01:14:58.240]   When does that start? Hopefully this week if I if I get off my button right something.
[01:14:58.240 --> 01:15:04.440]   So there's a lot of law involved in the gadget to blogging. Well heck there's you know there's
[01:15:04.440 --> 01:15:08.960]   a new legal story in technology every week. That's true. So the first thing the first thing
[01:15:08.960 --> 01:15:15.240]   I'm going to write about is there was another you know further development in the the Tivo
[01:15:15.240 --> 01:15:19.920]   Echo Star saga last week. So I'm going to sort of briefly recap that and really think
[01:15:19.920 --> 01:15:25.680]   about where where Tivo is going to go with this whole legislation. Right. Right. The
[01:15:25.680 --> 01:15:31.760]   litigation. We also have a technology podcast which I will get out technology law podcast
[01:15:31.760 --> 01:15:34.920]   which I will get out. I hope this week I had hope to get it out last week but the server
[01:15:34.920 --> 01:15:39.600]   crisis kind of put that on the back burner. Yeah looking forward to it. That's it's going
[01:15:39.600 --> 01:15:43.120]   to be good. You're going to like it. Alex Lindsey is at the Pixel core and is working
