[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   Episode 74 for October 29th, 2006.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   Memories.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   [ Music ]
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   This week in tech is brought to you by
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   Dell.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   Visit Leo's Bix for some great deals on Dell desktops
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   and laptops at twit.tv/dell.
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   [ Music ]
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   Hi, this is Leo Laport.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   I want to thank everybody for the wonderfully supportive
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   emails and messages and comments on the website.
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   We missed it a week last week.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   I scared some people.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   I didn't mean to scare you.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   I was just a little tired and burnt out and
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   I think a hard time putting a show together.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   Well, I'm gone on a cruise right now.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   I'm off with the Geek Cruises Mac Mania.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   But Joe Kelly did a pretty neat thing.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   He set me and he really did cheer me up.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:42.000]   An edited version of some of the best moments in his opinion
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   from many, many Twits.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   I think he goes back to some of the very earliest Twits.
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Before we even were called Twit.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   It's about an hour long show.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   I hope you'll enjoy these clips and I hope it'll wet your
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   appetite for a future Twits to come.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   You bet they're going to keep coming and we'll be back with
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   a special Twit from the cruise itself next Sunday, November 5th,
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   and then we'll be back to our regularly scheduled Twit, November 12th.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Thank you for all your support and enjoy these memories
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   from 73 great Twits.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   You got a lot of good suggestions for the show name,
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   but one of the ones I liked the best Patrick with Sledgecast.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Nice.
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Wouldn't that be great?
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   It's a Sledgecast.
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   We are going to unveil on the podcast this week our new name.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   I'm embarrassed to say that it was none of, as far as I can tell,
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   well, there's two possibilities, but the one that I'm kind of in favor with,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   nobody submitted probably because it's so boring.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   We got so many creative clever submissions.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   You want to hear some of the names that people sent in?
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Absolutely.
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Al Hill said saved by the geeks.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   That's kind of keeping the screensavers idea.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   I think a number of people did that.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Claudia Flores said, "WWSSD, what would the screensavers do?"
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   No.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   We'll leave that one out.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   There was also a G4 eats as young, but in a deference to G4,
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   we'll leave that one out.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Are you now or have you ever been a G4 employee?
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   No.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   How about this one?
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   I think you'd like this one, Patrick.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Those, by the way, were all from Shane.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   This is from Lance.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Return of the meat popsicles.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   Excellent.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   Green eggs of ram.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   That was from Kevin Davis.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   I like that one.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   Kurt Golic said, "Good fellows."
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   But I think maybe geek fellows might be good.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   Geek fellows.
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   What do you think?
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   No.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   That's pretty cool.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Kurt also suggested this week in geek.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Which is the closest to the one where I think I actually use.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   What do you think of this week in geek?
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   That's not bad at all.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   We can call it geek.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   We can call it geek.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Twig.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   TWIG.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   I like the fact that at Ron's, how about Alex's?
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   My big fat video cast.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   My big fat tiger.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   My big fat geek wedding.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   Yeah.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   My big fat geek cast.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Let's see.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Attack of the podcast.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   There are a lot of them where plays on Attack of the Show, Kevin.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   I think that like Dave said, "A hack of the show," which I kind of liked.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   A 10-year-old named Sonya suggested reunion of tech support scholars.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   She wanted to keep the ROTSS acronym.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   He hated tech support scholars.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   John Wilson, geek weekly.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   The pocket protectors.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Ray Bromley.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   That was a good one.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Here's one from Dustin that incorporates all of our kind of reputations.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   It's the revenge of the dark tipping sledgehammer swinging PC modding lab rat tech guys.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Excellent.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   It's a little long.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   Winner.
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   But I like it.
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   Hey, the domain name is available.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   I'm sure.
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Yeah, I think we can register that.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   Well, isn't there a domain name somebody registered that was like, because all the other good domain names were taken, something like that.com.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   All the other good domain names are taken.com.
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   Joel suggested four guys in a box of crap.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   Oh, jeez.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   Robert wasn't here last week.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   He doesn't know that that's the grand prize for this is we're giving Patrick's going to donate a box of crap from his garage.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Excellent.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   That's the grand prize.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Incredible.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Vital vintage computer technology.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   Completely random.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   Yes, credit will definitely be the mystery prize.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   I'm kind of embarrassed to admit that we're going to, I think we're going to go.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   Robert, you weren't in on this conversation because you were busy finding headsets.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   But I think we're going to go with the boring this week in tech.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   TWIT.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   And the only reason is I think the podcast has to say in its name what it is because otherwise when people look at it in the directory, they'll have no clue.
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Is that so boring that we should just say no?
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   Oh, thanks for backing me up, guys.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Well, I think the Skype just faded out again.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   Oh, it's yeah, it's the Skype problem.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   Same here, Leo.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Same here.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   Yeah, right.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   You couldn't hear the word I was saying.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   So I've registered TWIT.TV.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   We are all TWITs now.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   TWIT.TV will be the domain.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   The email address will be thisweekintech@gmail.com.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   And nobody is a winner, but somebody will get a box of crap as well as the four runners up.
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   We're all going to receive web hosting from VisiWeb and Jinx Hackware thanks to our donations there.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   Patrick, you saw that Wall Street Journal article about Corey Greenberg?
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   You said you worked with Corey?
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   I used to read it.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   I used to read it stuff in stereo file and a friend of mine, a guy I worked with for a short period of time at Windows Sources, it became a friend of mine was his editor for a while, a couple different magazines.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   Also, somebody was telling me that at least one of our former co-workers is making a fair amount of money.
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   I know who that former co-worker is actually.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Well, I'll tell you why I saw her at PMA, the photo show.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   She looked like she was doing TV.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   And she's up on a stage and she's doing the thing with the gadgets and it looked like it was for, you know, what you're doing?
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   She said, "Oh, it's a satellite media tour."
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   And I said, "What do you mean?"
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   She said, "Well, what happens is we feed this to local news stations."
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   I can't remember if it was paying her Panasonic or somebody.
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   And I show them all the products and it's never identified as being paid for by a company.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:31.000]   It's very lucrative.
[00:07:31.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   Yeah, it's very lucrative.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   I don't blame her for doing it.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   You know, I get offers to do these a lot.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   I mean, I've had several offers to do these and I always say no.
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   And this is the thing that bugs me just for people who didn't read the article.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   Wall Street Journal kind of outed a number of tech journalists saying that they're getting paid by the companies.
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   They're plugging on these.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   And the one they single that was Corey Greenberg, who's today's show's gadget guy and apparently does.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   Now, what they, what they, it wasn't clear and maybe you got a better sense than I did, Patrick.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   It didn't look like he'd been paid specifically for the today's show appearances.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   But that those companies had paid it back.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Well, one of the things, yeah, I mean, one of the things it was, one of the things, basically it was, it was, one of the things it was, the boy is a sentence in here just yearning to read for you.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   But down the mic, basically he was never, he maintained that he was never paid to promote products he was discussing on NBC.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   However, he had been, you know, promoted to do the, to do the tours by companies who, ironically enough, his products, he was demoing on NBC.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   Yeah, so you got a one?
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   And there was no disclosure of that.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   That's the big thing.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   It makes me mad too that NBC didn't say anything.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   Well, they basically, they said in a couple of the follow up articles that were at this, they've adjusted their policy.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   But they also didn't get rid of the guy who got nailed for it publicly.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   We had this problem on call for help.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Remember, Gadget Girl.
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   Yeah.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   Gadget Girl.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   Gadget Girl.
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   We found out that her flights were being paid for by one of the companies.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   And we said, "Sorry, you can't come back.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   We're not."
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   So, but the thing that bugs me is I think that people read this and assume that you and I and everybody else are all in the same.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   I mean, there was also, I mean, there was, I mean, one of my favorite, one of my favorite, you know, because I tend not to read the threads because they make me cry.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   But one of my favorite threads of all time was somebody was like, "Man, do you want to be owned by Intel?"
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   Intel advertises up.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   And it was on a day where you and I just completely ripped Intel, a new delete expletive because, you know, it's like Intel.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   It's another processor.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   It's a little bit faster than the last one.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   It's a lot more expensive than AMD.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   And it's a little bit more expensive than the old one.
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   And it's a little bit more expensive than the old one.
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   And it's a little bit more expensive than the old one.

[00:11:37.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   And we all get stuff in the mail.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   And it's a little bit more expensive than the old one.
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:14.000]   And it's a little bit more expensive than the old one.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   And it's a little bit more expensive than the old one.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   Seriously hot tip.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   If you're going to stop the fan on your big expensive computer so that the wine from the really loud power supply, you haven't replaced.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   Even though you have a brand new power supply sitting in the room with you that you haven't installed yet.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   When you're using that little removable steel tab that you know the card slot cover, don't stick it in too far or there'll be a loud pop.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   And that your power will stop.
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   So you're using the card slot to physically stop the fan?
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   Well now I'm not because the power supply's dead.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   Dude you're shooting for a Darwin award.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   You just catch up on that part of my life.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   Part of the fun of working with Patrick is the risk.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   Tomorrow June 6th Steve Jobs gets up on the stage at the World Wide Developer Conference.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   The Wall Street Journal is to be believed, if seen it is to be believed.
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   He will announce that future Macs will not have power PC chips in them but will have instead Intel chips.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   That to me is a huge story.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   Huge story.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   You know frankly I've been saying this is the end of the world for Apple.
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   Apple is shooting itself in the foot committing Harry Carrey.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   It's Steve Jobs' ultimate act of arrogance.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   The first person I thought of to call was John C. Devorak, another member of the Twit team who hasn't been here because his Skype is still not working.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   I actually use this technology they called a telephone and called John and I asked him what he thought about all this.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   So you should make this sound dour. I have just the opposite take that you have on this.
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   I mean you're making it sound like first of all let's go over this and I did have this written up in 2003.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   I expected it to happen last year in 2004 based on what I heard that was going on.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   It's possible that it took longer to do the middleware part which is going to be the things that allow some of the software to run on the new platform much the same way the power PC made its transition.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   Now take a look at the timing on this though. We had a ten year period of the sixty eight thousand and a ten year period of the power PC and now we're going to have a ten year intel period.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   I don't see that this is such a big deal in terms of the progress that the company has been making.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   I think this is going to be one of the greatest benefits for Apple that the company could ever imagine.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:51.000]   Well what do they stand again?
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   First of all is to and I've been arguing that they should be doing this day or they should have started doing this maybe ten years ago which is that they can bring out a standardized intel platform running this BSD Unix that they have.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   Oh I'm sorry it's OSX. Running on a kind of a standardized PC platform they can also manufacture standard PCs for people who want to maybe still use Windows even though I think that they're actually making it.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   I think that they're maybe a swing toward OSX for intel or which I call a Mac intel.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   So you think they're going to make a dual boot system that runs both Windows and Apple?
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   I think it's doable and I think also if I had a choice and I think I could speak for most PC users even though you've abandoned the platform I could say for most PC users and I've just written this up for PC magazine it'll be running tomorrow.
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   I think most of these computers that we have on our desk the PC users are going to have all the appeal of a 1977 Plymouth.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   I agree with you.
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   People will spend a few extra dollars to have a good looking computer that means Apple can sell against Dell and HP the same machine with a premium price getting the margins that those other guys will never get and pretty much decimate the market.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:14.000]   I think this is probably the biggest possible possibly the biggest thing Apple has ever done in terms of potentially becoming a dominant computer.
[00:16:14.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   But what about the Adobe's and the Microsoft's? How are they going to rewrite their software? What are they going to do?
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   Well they've done it before and they've packed Adobe seems to rewrite it software every two years or every year for that matter.
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   I mean anyway I mean they're all constant. This is a recompilation thing anyway.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   Adobe already has this software running on the X80 system. How difficult can it be?
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   Oh it could be very difficult because their Windows version relies on Windows API which is not the system.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   There's a middleware company that Apple's in love with right now and I have their name somewhere but it's going to take care of that issue.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   This is not going to be as big a deal as you make it out to me.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   So in the middleware company I think you're thinking of is I had the name here.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   Yeah it's so forgettable. It's not a memorable name is it transitive?
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   Something like that.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   In the change from 68,000 to power PC these were very similar chips.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   They were able to make it possible for the operating system to run both with something called FAT binaries.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   The program could run in both modes and there was a transitional period.
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   It wasn't a very happy period.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   No of course and this won't be either. In fact one of the other things that Apple did was bring up that power Macintosh upgrade card which they can do again.
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:36.000]   So people can use the old machines and then put this card in and make a transition slowly.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   My argument is this. This is the time for Apple to do it.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   They can suffer through a transition like this.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   I agree with that part. It's not going to be easy.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   But with the iPod iTunes thing making tons of money for them.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   This is the time to make this move because this long term is a fantastic idea.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   Well I think it's gutsy. I think we're going to look at tomorrow as the day Apple committed suicide.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   And here's why I think the exact opposite.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   First of all they're on a platform that is far from MoraBund.
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   I think that the cell chip which is a power PC based chip is a very exciting future chip.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   I think the Intel platform on the other hand has run out of steam.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   I think they're moving to a processor platform that is seeing the end of its line.
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   Well there's a couple of things there. One is that apparently the story has it that Steve was like skipped by IBM concerning the cell chip and kind of put it back in place.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   That I believe I can see this being an arrogant move on Steve's part.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   An ego move but I think it's going to be suicide.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   I again disagree. The other thing is about the cell chip.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   Jobs has been poo-pooing it as a lousy.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   And the other guy who's doing both of these are questionable sources for criticism.
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   I mean Steve says this chip is no good and then also Bill Gates.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   Again I agree that this is coming from a guy who's got a competitive product.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   But at the same time Gates is complaining about this chip.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   And some of the people with an Intel have some issues with this chip.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:12.000]   So you think I knew multi-threaded multi-core Intel chips are nothing to be sneezed at.
[00:19:12.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   I agree the new Pentium D and the Hyperthreading and then dual cores.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   They're trying to keep this chip's family alive but it's not a long term solution.
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   You think the G5 is the end of the line for power PC from IBM?
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   Well I mean they probably will continue to upgrade the chip for their own internal uses.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   What about the notion of Intel maybe doing something new for Apple?
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   You think that's credible? No.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   It's going to be an Intel x86 chip.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   I have to be. I mean if they did something like what you just described which nobody said,
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   I mean that's purely difficult.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   Highly speculative yeah. Yeah totally. I mean there's no evidence of this.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   I mean it's I mean you know long you know of course you never know.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   But we would have known about something.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   I mean when my original piece when I first stumbled onto the meetings
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   I had you know thought what might happen that would be interesting and I thought it would be kind of interesting
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   if Apple went to the I-Tanium because they could use it for the servers and it would be different
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   and Intel's begging for people to buy the thing.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   Well that at least has a future.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   The x86 on their Intel is it's end of line product.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   Well I mean I'm not in agreement with that because I mean I know where you're coming from saying that
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   in fact you know the with the legacy out there and the fact that this chip is getting faster and faster
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:38.000]   with the multi cores and I know Intel says no 4 gigahertz.
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   No nobody wants to do 4 gigahertz they'd rather do more cores.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   I mean you can get double the performance by doubling the number of cores on the same guy because I think they're shrinking so much.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   I have two cores in my G5 right now. I have two processes.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   You're ahead of me.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   But most people do.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   We're talking to John C. Devore at columnist for PC Magazine and certainly a guy who if anybody knows what's going on.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   So you does you believe the scene at report you think this will happen tomorrow.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   Yeah I do and the Wall Street Journal is also kind of you know saying it's a done deal.
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   I mean then there's a blog right there which I link to in my blog if you go to devork.org/blog
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   who made this observation that he found a language observation he looked at the articles and noticed that they weren't
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   neither seen that nor the Wall Street Journal were had any weasel words in their stories.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   We've seen Adam and yeah.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   You know I mean it was like you know this we got this on good authority and the newspapers now a days or so gun shy about
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   not weaseling out of you know some of these assertions that when they don't have them in there that's actually a signal.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   Well especially with Steve Jobs you don't want to be a rumor monger with Steve Jobs so.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   Yeah well you have to wonder if somebody from Apple is actually feeding this story to the Journal and to see that.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   Well you know he's done that before because he's you know seeing it looks like it's picking the story up from the Journal but you know Jobs plays
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   favorites with the high end media and most of the people are irked with him about it because he'll you know put everybody on an embargo to a certain date
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   and then give the story to Newsweek so they can run it the day before.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   Or Mossberg.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   Yeah Mossberg's a big guy he's like a kind of a stooge for Apple.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   And he's at the Journal and I could easily see them feeding this to Mossberg and him feeding it upstairs.
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   Yeah actually that's a good point to be excellent.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   Well you know I just it scares the heck out of me it doesn't seem like it's necessary I think Apple's in a good position right now it is a very gutsy move.
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:41.000]   I mean your scenario is attractive if they could start shipping computers that would run both windows and OS 10 I think there's a big market for that.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   I think it's a huge market for and I think the other upside for Apple would be that they get one of the problems they're always going to have with only selling one million computers a quarter compared to the hundred two hundred and seventy five million machines
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:23:02.000]   that are sold every year this is ridiculously low number is that you can't get the developer interest that you can to a market that has a hundred million.
[00:23:02.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   So you think that's the that's the carrot they're going to offer these guys for rewriting all of their software.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   Do you think Microsoft's going to play along offices? I think Microsoft Microsoft Microsoft no I don't think it's as critical as you think it is anymore.
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   I think and besides that if you bring out a dual boot machine who cares but the point is that you know I think Apple's been trying to get out from underneath Mike I mean that's why they've been bringing out products that kind of compete with Microsoft products.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   Ever since Microsoft or Macintosh basic the product that was killed by Microsoft the people in the Mac community would love to just ditch Microsoft and go off and do their own thing and you know and there's a lot of good stuff out there that runs on on Unix machines.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   I mean some of it has crappy menuing systems unfortunately because the Unix guys they think weird but you know except for that Piccadillo I think most of this stuff I think you can outfit OS X.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   With no Microsoft material on it at all and do very well for yourself.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   Would you get in line to buy one of these machines?
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   I was asking me about buying stuff.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   I know you don't have to.
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   But if you if for some reason you didn't get one would you would you.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   This is the kind of machine that if I was like a computer buyer.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   Which I'm not I'm a writer about computers I don't go out you know I don't I just be testing stuff all the time so don't worry about buying stuff.
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   But if I was a computer buyer and I had to line up of different machines out there and Apple which has already developed his name as a kind of like I mentioned the column tomorrow kind of the Lexus compared to the fords and Chevy's Dell and HP.
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   I think I would buy the Lexus I have a Lexus I would buy a Lexus computer I mean something that's a little nicer it's maybe you might think it's better made it probably the same company in China making them all but definitely a better looking machine with a lot of cashay.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   I would get the Macintosh in a minute.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   All right well there you have it John thank you for caught on such short notice for coming on the show I really.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   No any time Leo you know me.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   So there you have it John C. Devorek he says it's a done deal and it's a great idea I you know you heard me I just don't buy it.
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   Why do you think it's a bad deal here I'll give you the three reasons all right.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   Reason number one all your software has to be rewritten and it is non-trivial I know everybody's going crazy.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   Oh no the drivers are already there believe me Adobe just because Adobe makes a Windows version of Photoshop and a power PC version of Photoshop doesn't mean it's easy at all to make a Intel X version of Photoshop that's just a whole new kettle of fish and no matter what you know it's you don't just recompile you rewrite and it's a lot of work and you know they went through this ten years ago I don't know if they're going to go through it again the only thing that might convince them is maybe there's a giant market so maybe we will.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   Secondly why x86 why not Athlon why not optor on why why saddle yourself with a company that's at the end of the line.
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   It's just I mean it doesn't make any sense.
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   Roger I just wanted to do you mean end of the line for Intel or just for the x86 family.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   Well and in the line for x86 I mean you got to make a decision are you going.
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   I mean you think it'll be an I Tainium by the way let me introduce Roger Chang who's somehow taken the place of David Prager I don't know how it happened but it's magic.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   Roger is writing about games for a game spot over at CNET and by the way Roger maybe you have some insight how did CNET get this story.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   Well actually I work for a game spot in the way CNET actually separates its vision to keep it pretty much behind closed doors.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   Let's go so let's go back. So anyway those are two points and I'm sure there's a third but address those if you will gentlemen.
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   You think it's a good idea Patrick?
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   I just think in terms of the sheer volume of the chips and the fact that they've got to be able to get the chips cheaper.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   They've got to have access to better chips that's you know it's it's just seems like from Dvorak at a really good point.
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   I mean if they're tapping into an architecture that's going on to you know 125, 175 million PC a year it's a lot easier to get deals.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   So you think they had to for economic reasons?
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   I think they probably had to for economic reasons and it's probably getting really difficult to compete you know with there's still you know the reason intel always held on to the megahertz numbers on the on the processors is because the marketing people always said people went in and they go for the biggest
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   number of megahertz even if the performance is unrelated you know that's why Cyrix did branding that sort of upsold their you know from their clock speed up to what their actual performance was AMD's done that.
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   You think Microsoft's going to rewrite Microsoft Office for and this is exactly the moment Microsoft's been waiting for it to dump Apple.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   Well you know like how important is Microsoft Office?
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   It's the number one selling application on Macintosh.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   What percentage I mean but what percentage of the users actually use it?
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   Well I mean you have to have it if you want to live in a Windows world and you want to use a Mac.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:18.000]   By the way here's my third and I don't use a Mac.
[00:28:18.000 --> 00:28:22.000]   Well I use open office I don't live on Microsoft Office.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   And you can use open office on Mac but you have to run X-Windows.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   Here's the third reason I think it's a very compelling reason it's the Osborne effect.
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   They're announcing now that in six months the mini will be based on Intel and in 18 months all of their products are based on Microsoft Office.
[00:28:36.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   They're not going to sell one more Mac for 18 months.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   That's it.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   Who would buy a Mac now knowing you're going Intel and every bit of software you buy is obsolete.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   This is a stupid move.
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   I'm telling you we're going to look back at this and say this is when Steve Jobs fell on his sword.
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   No I don't know about that.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   Alright Kevin you've explained it to me.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   This is so exciting.
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   I mean I have two Macs.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   I have three PCs and the only reason I don't just have one computer is because I want OS X and I also want to be able to play my games.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   I do like a dual boot.
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   I do like and the Dvorak brought that up.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:16.000]   Dual boot PC Mac is attractive.
[00:29:16.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   But that's a total fantasy.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:20.000]   You don't think that will happen?
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:21.000]   It can happen if it's based on Intel chips.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   And the other thing is you don't have to do a boot at all.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   They can run a nice little emulator that runs inside the OS X that will be native on the X86 base processors.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   So you really won't see the slowdown that you would if you're running it in like a processor emulation type mode.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   You could do, you're exactly right.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   You don't have to do a dual boat.
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   You could just have dual boat.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   Oh buy, emulating or hackable.
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   But I don't see Steve ever signing off on doing a dual boot.
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   You know, Macintosh system.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   Why are you so stoked about this then Kevin?
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:50.000]   Let's say you can only buy a Mac Intel.
[00:29:50.000 --> 00:29:53.000]   Is it a dual boot that gets you excited?
[00:29:53.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   Well the main thing that gets me excited is that I've always been a huge fan of Apple hardware.
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   I mean the way they design things, the computer, if you take part of G5, open it up, play with it.
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   It's beautiful.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   Everything is laid out so clean and so well.
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   The power supply, every piece of that computer is so well engineered, it blew me away.
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   And I would love to have, I would pay a few extra hundred dollars for a nice Apple that could run my, you know, not only my Mac applications but my windows as well.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:23.000]   Robert Herron, what do you think?
[00:30:23.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   I see this maybe as a first stage for Apple in terms of creating competition for Microsoft and the operating systems.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   Sweet down the road.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   If their software suddenly is x86 compatible, then wants to keep them from, you know, maybe making it better operating system and possibly throw more competition to win this.
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   That's a great question Robert because are they going to release OS 10 as a standalone product that you can install?
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   Or any x86, you don't think so?
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   Apple's a hardware company.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   It's true.
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   They are not a software company.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:01.000]   Well, you know, also there's a nightmare in terms of legacy coverage for hardware on the Windows side.
[00:31:01.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   They've never had to address on the, then all of a sudden they would have to address that.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   You're right.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   I mean they own the hardware, they don't have to worry about it.
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   They know exactly what they're running for.
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   I think what you do at that point is you do like what the OS did.
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   And that is when you start to release it, you only select, you know, here's 15 motherboards that we're compatible with.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   Here's 10 different chips that's used, 10 different video cards.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   Very limited hardware support for the services.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   So like no as 10 certified motherboard, OS 10 certified video card.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   I mean, you know, it's interesting because Apple has a lot of the content creation software.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   I mean, they have Shake, they have a few other 3D rendering.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   Motion is live.
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   Oh, they have a lot of video space.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   So, I mean, it would be feasible that, you know, Steve could be thinking that, you know, there's so much.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   You know, there's so many people kind of already invested in that, saw for that technology and that kind of learning that they had to do for it that they'll want to switch over, you know, down the road where they require more power and they acquire, you know, updates to offer to run it.
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   It's like we granted it's running on the architecture, but from their point of view, it should still feel and look like an OS 10 Macintosh.
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   You could see this if, you know, PowerPC was dead, if IBM wasn't innovating, if it were kind of a moribund, you know, processor family.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   And I can see making the move, but IBM is an innovator.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   They're the first to use copper.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   They're doing this cell chip.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   I know Steve Jobs poo poo's the cell chip, but I think it's going to be the...
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   What's the... but what's the software transition, you know what I mean?
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   It's like what's worse, the software transition from the G5 to the cell processor or the software transition from the G5 to...
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   Into easily.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   The cell processor has a power PC controller chip.
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   It's a... I mean, now I'm speculating, but because it's a power PC controller chip, it's power PC family.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   I think it's going to be an easier transition, a much easier transition.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:05.000]   Look what happened. Microsoft has gone to power PC for Xbox. PlayStation has gone to sell for the PlayStation 3.
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   Apple is going upstream. They're going the wrong direction.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   Yeah, but those are also relatively closed platforms and they're primarily looking at gaming performance.
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   But they're going to sell millions and gaming performance is very similar to 3D rendering, to MP3 conversion, to digital video.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   It's the stuff we do.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   I think they're going against the trend in processors right now.
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   They may be bugging in the trend in processors, but I think what they're really going after here is they've realized that people won't switch unless they have that, you know, certain application or that certain game that can run on their Mac.
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   And the true way to do this, the best way to do it would be to run native x86 base where you wouldn't have to have a crazy emulator.
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:49.000]   It could just run right inside of OS X.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:57.000]   But remember that most of these games are written to a Windows API to a DirectX API. They're more tied to Windows than they are tied to Intel.
[00:33:57.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   You still have to run Windows.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   Right, you would have to have the kernel running with inside there.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:08.000]   But just like the way a virtual PC operates right now, you can launch a Windows based application directly from the task bar.
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.000]   It would be the same thing without the emulation.
[00:34:10.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   So what does Microsoft's take on this?
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   Is this good for Microsoft or bad for Microsoft? Does Bill Gates support this?
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   Because if Bill Gates says there's no way they're going to be able to run Windows on this thing, they're not going to run Windows on it.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   And do you think Bill Gates is going to say that?
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   Or is he going to say, "Oh good, another chance to make some money." I don't think so.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   Why would he say there's no way though?
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.000]   Because it's a huge threat.
[00:34:33.000 --> 00:34:38.000]   First of all, it's a threat. If this works, it's a threat to Windows.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   And he doesn't, I think inherently, he doesn't like this whole idea.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   It's Apple saying, "Hey, we're going to move over to your side."
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   Oh, I think he hates the idea. But the thing is that he can't stop it.
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:50.000]   If it's x86 based, anyone can put Windows on there.
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   As long as Apple allows it. I know Apple could stop it if they wanted it.
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   Yeah, and I just think that if normal users are going to do it, it has to be with the cooperation of Microsoft.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   Because they, well, they own for one thing. They own the MLM, the emulator, soft PC.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   So that's the thing.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.000]   Would you buy one, Leo?
[00:35:09.000 --> 00:35:13.000]   Oh, of course. If I'd buy a dual boot Windows Mac machine, I guess I would.
[00:35:13.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   I mean, you know, most of us, all of us live in a dual processor.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   We have Windows and Macs. And that's a satisfactory solution for me right now.
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   I do most of my work on Macs, but, you know, this tablet PC is great.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   I mean, I'm using it for, you know, as a date book, $2,000 date timer.
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   That's a expensive date book.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   It is, but it's great.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   Big breakable and it won't fit.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   I didn't buy the way it'll last a half a day.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   It's almost as small as my date timer.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   You know, it only costs 10 times more.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   You know, it's interesting. I noticed that somebody was commenting on one of the issues Apple had with the cell processor was that there was no VMX-Alt-FX.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   Or there wasn't a sophisticated...
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   It doesn't need it.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   It's sophisticated-Alt-FX.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   Doesn't need it.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   Yeah.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   I mean, the whole machine is an Alt-FX machine.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:07.000]   It's SIMD, it's SIMD in hardware.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   I mean, but they'd have to redo all of the code that was made for Alt-FX.
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   Oh, yeah.
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   Well, that's true.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   Well, they're going to redo code no matter what now.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   I mean, there's no question you've got OS X in the lab running on Intel.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   I mean, they've had that all along.
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:22.000]   Yeah, Mark-Warp project is what they call this.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   Yeah, I mean, that's easy.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   I'm not worried about the operating system.
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   I'm not worried about drivers.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   I'm just application developers.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   You know, you're going to leave behind.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:33.000]   Maybe you won't leave Macra media behind or Adobe behind.
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   Although neither of these companies have much love for Apple anymore.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   It would be interesting to know just what percentage of either, you know, especially Macra media
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   or Adobe, what percentage of their sales are still to the Macintosh platform.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:53.000]   It's telling that Steve's making this announcement at the developers conference.
[00:36:53.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   Clearly the announcement is he's going to have to really kiss some butt over there.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   And tell the ISVs, the software vendors, we love you.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   We're going to support you.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   You've got to develop this.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   He went through this in '94 when they went to PowerPC.
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   This is even worse.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   Now, maybe it's easier in some respects because they know Intel.
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   But, you know, I mean, you don't nowadays, you don't write to the processor.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   You write to the operating system.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   You write to the API.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:27.000]   So do you think the key here is going to be a suite that he announces saying,
[00:37:27.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   "Hey, this is the one suite where you'll be able to develop your application
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   and easily port it to Windows if you want to."
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   He has to do something.
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   You know what, Kevin?
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   You hit the nail on the head.
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:36.000]   I hadn't thought of that.
[00:37:36.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   But that's exactly what he has to do.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   He has to say, "We have tools that will develop.
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   You want right once it runs on both.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   You're exactly right, Kevin.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   That's what he has to do."
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   They may be able to do that.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   Now, that's compelling.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   So will I be able to get a G5 in like a shuttle case in like three years?
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   I don't think anybody will be getting a G5 in three years if this keeps up.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   You don't have to get an Xbox.
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   All right.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   I think we've done this to death.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   Let's just go around the horn and cast a thumbs up or thumbs down.
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   Good for Apple.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:12.000]   Bad for Apple.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   Kevin Rose.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   Thumbs up.
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   Robert Herron.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   I'd say thumbs down for the hardware side.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   Roger Chang.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   It's a thumbs up for software and thumbs down for the hardware.
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   You will wiesel.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:27.000]   Patrick Norton.
[00:38:27.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   Hey, if it makes for a cheaper Mac, great.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   But I still don't believe it's going to happen.
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   I believe it's going to happen and I think it's going to be the end of the line for Apple.
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   I'm very disappointed.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   I hope you're enjoying this best of edition of Twit.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   Brought to you by Joe Kelly.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   I know I am.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   In just a moment, perhaps the most famous moment in Twit history.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   Before we do that, I do want to remind you that Twit is made possible by the good folks at Dell.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   Who are providing their financial support for this podcast and the entire Twit network.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   We encourage you if it's time to get a new computer.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   Maybe you're thinking about a VISTA PC.
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   Visit Dell.
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   We've got some great picks on our webpage.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   Just go to twit.tv/dell.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   Take a look at Leo's picks.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   And then, even if you don't want to buy Leo's picks, click the links there because there are some other, of course, many more great Dell deals available.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   And every time you go through our page to get to Dell, we get credit.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   So your support and Dell support is much appreciated.
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   Again, twit.tv/dell.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:38.000]   And now, ladies and gentlemen, it wouldn't be a best of without this moment featuring John C. Devorak and Steve Gibson.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   We're going to toss it to John because John's a little upset about Steve Gibson's spam filtering solution.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   I hate to use the word "solution" because it's like the total evil marketing phrase that it works.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:54.000]   I like saying "solution" once in a while just because it feels so naughty.
[00:39:54.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   But John, you're a little upset about Steve's email management system.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   Steve, what would you call it? Your filtering tool?
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   I'm not sure what we're talking about.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   You wouldn't know because he doesn't get this mail.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   So, let me explain what he's got here.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   Steve, let me go check. Let me get the message up here.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   Oh, wait a minute. You're talking about the fact that we don't allow HTML in here.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   Yeah, listen to this.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   There's a message going around everyone out there should know that kind of the inside baseball here when it comes to this show.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   Everybody sends a memo out on Terry and Sunday goes all over the place.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   Check this link. We're going to talk about this, that, and the other thing.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   As if we plan this show.
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   Well, you know, there's actually a better plan than what Leo used to do.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   Anyway, so you send the thing, reply to all, and then you get this message back because Gibson's email.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   Being the Mickey Mouse system that it is.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   That's actually doing some real work or getting a spam filter.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   You get this message back that says, "Your HTML email was refused by our server."
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   Hello. Your email to grc.com was not delivered because it contains, quote, HTML formatting.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   HTML stands for Hypertext Markup Language.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   This is the name to use by the web pages on the World Wide Web.
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   Since nearly, then listen to this one, says nearly all unsolicited commercial email spam uses HTML.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   This is bull, by the way, to create the, what about those Nigerian letters?
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   I've never seen one of those in HTML.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   Okay.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   So, somebody was on and on and on.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   I sent it back to him, be saying, "What does this be at?"
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:32.000]   And I get it back again because apparently there was a link in there.
[00:41:32.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   This is, to me, is just basically an insult to anyone trying to send HTML.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   My email goes through fine.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   But once Steve approves you because if you don't send HTML mail, I agree with them.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   Well, I know, but you can send Steve HTML if he approves you.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   Hey, HTML mail is not going away.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   I'd be happy to whitelist you, John.
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   You'll know, just if HTML mail is just appearing.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   Just put some grease on your email and it slides right in.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   What's wrong with, Steve, what's wrong with HTML email?
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   Oh, hi, tons of garbage inside of it.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   Well, I mean, it really is the case that we're phenomenally buried by email unless we do that.
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   And we've tried it as an experiment to remove the HTML filter and it's just a phenomenal difference.
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:22.000]   I think it's a clever way.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   I think it's a clever way.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:25.000]   I work here over at computer time over here in the peninsula.
[00:42:25.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   It has a bunch of high-level email filters.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   I would think you, you, you, you, but no spam.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   Who would say, who would say, you know, email should just be text.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   No, wait a minute, John, do you get no spam because you have a minion of evil helpers that sort through your mail for you?
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   So it all shows up without the spam or do you actually not get any spam?
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   It's not.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   It's not a minute security.
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   I do not get any spam.
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   How do you do your--
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   Yeah, John, tell us.
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   That's impossible.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.000]   How do you do that, John?
[00:42:57.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   I don't do it.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   Who does it?
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   Mark Percal, he's like a genius.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   He runs this little service called Computer Time, which is the guy that he's-- I know this guy for 25 years.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   He started off being like a net-aware guy and had a thing called Mark's menu back in the 80s.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   Is this something we can use?
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   Yeah, we could.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   How could we use this?
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   You just have to go through his system with your mail and just get cleared right out.
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   Does he offer this as a commercial service or do you have to be a friend of this?
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   Yeah, he does.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:24.000]   Is it softwaretime.com?
[00:43:24.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   Is that his website?
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   It's www.ctym.com.
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   All right.
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   I use something similar.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   I use server-side email, spam protection from mail route, which does work very well.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   Cloud Mark, same thing, works very well.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   Bright mail.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   Right.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   This actually works very well in Bright Mail.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   He actually has my server.
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   I mean, he does the whole thing for me, but he can do just the email part of it.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   And I get no spam.
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   None?
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   None.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   I even get-- I mean, I still get 10 or 15.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:54.000]   10 or 15.
[00:43:54.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   One thing will sneak in a week.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   And then you send it back to Mark and you'll never see it again.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   It's unbelievable.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   What's the URL?
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   ctyme.com.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   Right.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   We can't get there, but-- because it's blocking you, Patrick, you're using HTML.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   Well, it's computer type.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   Okay, so this is-- why do you, John, why do you say HTML email is not going away?
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   I mean, it is a blight.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:14.000]   The bitmail is bloated.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   It hides stuff.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   It's ugly.
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   You don't think "increda mail" is a good thing, surely.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   Actually, you know what?
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   It's so--
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   Wait, so this guy--
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   It's not HTML based.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:27.000]   Google's email service is HTML based.
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   Yeah, but you can turn it off.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   That's true.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   But I mean, by default, all web mail is going to--
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   Not going away because the general public doesn't know what the hell anybody-- what Steve Gibson's talking about.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   When it comes to this, like, refusal to-- in fact, I think most people, if they were writing the
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   Steve when they got that memo, they'd go, "I don't know what he's talking about."
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   Well, then that's why he explains it so clearly.
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   He explains it and it doesn't help.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   I talk about it all the time.
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   I've been saying on the radio show for two years, don't use HTML mail.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   Well, John--
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   I don't know if it's thinking about it.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   John, you're not going away.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   John, you're now white listed so you can send me any crap that you want to.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:03.000]   I know.
[00:45:03.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   It will come right here.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   From now on, you're getting spam.
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   By the way, John.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   On dvorak.org.
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   So computer time is your web host, John, and they're using spam access and to filter your email.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   Oh, he's a spam access.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   Now, spam access is only one of the many mechanisms for you.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   Okay, well.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   What I do is website is using spam access and an XML.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   Spam access is very good.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   I do spam access and it does it.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   And many people have it.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   They don't know it.
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   Their internet service provider would turn it on if they ask.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:32.000]   So in your case, John, let's go ahead.
[00:45:32.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   We also know many instances where spam access unfolds positives and like blocks people who have--
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   Here's what I do with spam access.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   First of all, turn off all real-time black holes.
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   And we should point out that spam access runs on your email server.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   These are all server-side.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   Turn off the black hole stuff because you're right.
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:53.000]   Maps and orbs will have lots of false positives.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   So I turn that off.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   The second thing you do is you set the setting fairly high.
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   You set it to eight.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   The default is 6.5, I think, or six.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   You set it to eight.
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:03.000]   And that way, only the really most egregious stuff gets stopped.
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:05.000]   But that's 80% of all.
[00:46:05.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   Okay, well, let me tell you what the other thing that he does, which is not mentioned there.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   He uses a three-stage filtering system and maybe spam it seriously.
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   Does he sound like you're advertising vodka, John, the micronight filter?
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   Because I thought that was really good.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   That's what made Kent so smooth.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   You know what?
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   If you guys don't want to hear about it, then find me.
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   I have no spam.
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   Three-stage filter, John.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   Three-stage filter.
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   My latest email does me just fine.
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   Okay, tell us about the three-stage filter.
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   You know what?
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   I'm not talking about it anymore.
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:39.000]   I've already given enough publicity.
[00:46:39.000 --> 00:46:41.000]   People out there just go check it out.
[00:46:41.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   FeedTime.com.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   Good man.
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   Big story of the week.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   And it's just making me hop in, man.
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   We covered it on security now with Steve Gibson in detail.
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   I actually did an early security now because it was such a big story.
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   It first came to light last month, but nobody paid much attention to it.
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   The F-Secure people said Sony is putting a rootkit on Windows systems when you run Sony
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:05.000]   BMG audio CDs.
[00:47:05.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   Hey, hey, nobody paid any attention until the fellow from Sysinterinals who makes a rootkit
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:20.000]   revealer program called Rootkit Revealer mentioned it in his blog and the world came
[00:47:20.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   tumbling down.
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   That was earlier this week.
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   So here's the deal.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   If you have a Sony BMG disc, they've been doing this since last spring that says content enhanced
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.000]   and protected copy.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.000]   How many titles or how many albums release?
[00:47:35.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   You know, it's not clear.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   Nobody's ever said.
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   Sony's not saying.
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   So let me stop running CDs two years ago.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   But if you look at it, you'll know because the CD will say content enhanced.
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   If you play it on a Windows machine, you'll get a Yule.
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   You'll get a license agreement that pops up and says, "Is it okay to install some software?"
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   It mis-describes the software, including it implies that you can remove it easily or
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   disable it easily.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   And so most people are just saying, "Yeah, yeah, okay, I just want to listen to my music."
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   What it's installing is effectively a rootkit, which a rootkit, of course, is a hacker
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:12.000]   tool that allows software to hide on your computer files, to hide on your computer, hide so well,
[00:48:12.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   because by patching the kernel that no program, not even the operating system, can see these
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   files.
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:18.000]   They're just invisible.
[00:48:18.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   In fact, the way that SysNeternals rootkit revealer does it is by actually writing its own
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   operating system code and comparing what it gets with a directory listing to what the operating
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:29.000]   system's saying.
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   And if there's a discrepancy, if rootkit revealer is finding files that the operating system
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   doesn't know about, it says, "You've got a rootkit."
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:39.000]   But you can install that for the fact, you don't need this.
[00:48:39.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   The SysNeternals rootkit revealer is great.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:44.000]   There's also one called Blacklight from FSecure.
[00:48:44.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   They basically both work the same way.
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:50.000]   But Mark Recinovich, who's at SysNeternals, was the guy on Monday who said, "This is
[00:48:50.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   Sony" that's the rootkit on here.
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   So is this because Sony decided to license a protection, like some kind of DRM?
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:00.000]   From an echromatic British company.
[00:49:00.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   What did they naive in the company that made this DRM technology?
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   No, but did the company that made the DRM technology decide, "Hey, let's put this on here and make
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   it really sloppily."
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   And Sony just said, "Okay, this is probably good stuff we'll put on."
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   You've got two basic options.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   Either Sony went, "Wow, this looks like an incredibly robust system for protecting our content,
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   preserving our revenue stream."
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   Or Sony knew exactly what it was doing and was like, "Yeah."
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:27.000]   I choose the latter.
[00:49:27.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   As someone who used to work for Sony, a long time ago.
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   Evil!
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   Hey, I left.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:35.000]   I left.
[00:49:35.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   Okay.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   A long, over a decade ago.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:38.000]   Before the BMG thing.
[00:49:38.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   Before the BMG thing.
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   Before the BMG thing.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   But I wasn't there.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   I wasn't part of the decision maker.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:47.000]   But I would actually suggest that they may not have...
[00:49:47.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   There's a lot of decisions.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   There's a lot of decisions that they make.
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   You know, some executive...
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   Nobody sat down with the executive and said, "We're going to use a rootkit."
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   No, no, no, no.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   Yeah, it's like...
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   The executive doesn't know how to check his email.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   Great.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:02.000]   What's a rootkit?
[00:50:02.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   Yeah.
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   All they said in the executive is, "No, don't worry.
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   No one will know it's there.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   No one will be able to see it.
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   It hides itself."
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:14.000]   In fact, it was possible to remove it and they patched it just a few months ago to prevent
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   removal.
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   And so what I think Sony is culpable for is that much.
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   Somebody said to them, "Oh, yeah.
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   You cannot install it."
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   And they said, "Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   We don't want that to happen."
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   Now, this thing is so badly written that it scans your disk like eight times a minute.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.800]   It double scans it, but worse.
[00:50:31.800 --> 00:50:36.400]   And I think the real serious thing is it means that any file that begins with dollar sign,
[00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:42.760]   S-Y-S dollar sign, any file will disappear is immediately root-kitted.
[00:50:42.760 --> 00:50:48.200]   So I, in fact, Mark Reissinovich, who discovered this took notepad.exe and renamed it to dollar
[00:50:48.200 --> 00:50:50.200]   sign, sys dollar sign, notepad.exe.
[00:50:50.200 --> 00:50:51.200]   And it disappeared.
[00:50:51.200 --> 00:50:54.840]   It could, I quote, third party hacker could just take advantage of knowing that they could
[00:50:54.840 --> 00:50:55.840]   hide stuff like that.
[00:50:55.840 --> 00:50:59.840]   Funny you should mention that because there's a world of Warcraft hack that's been built
[00:50:59.840 --> 00:51:01.560]   around the root kids.
[00:51:01.560 --> 00:51:02.560]   Oh, really?
[00:51:02.560 --> 00:51:04.080]   I know that.
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:07.200]   So somebody's got a hack that they put on your system?
[00:51:07.200 --> 00:51:08.920]   No, not an arse, but...
[00:51:08.920 --> 00:51:10.600]   She used to cheat in the game.
[00:51:10.600 --> 00:51:11.600]   Yeah.
[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:13.720]   And they used that to hide it essentially.
[00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:19.000]   And all the anti-year-old who knows enough to rename a file, dollar sign, sys dollar sign,
[00:51:19.000 --> 00:51:20.360]   can't, in fact, put anything you want.
[00:51:20.360 --> 00:51:22.160]   They want on your system.
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:25.800]   So not, I mean, Sony can say, well, look, you know, I mean, there's root-kit technology
[00:51:25.800 --> 00:51:29.040]   used in Kaspersky antivirus in Norton.
[00:51:29.040 --> 00:51:30.880]   The trash protect.
[00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:32.440]   They could say, look, this is legitimate.
[00:51:32.440 --> 00:51:37.000]   Other companies use this, but what they can't say is what really a problem is that they're
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:40.520]   opening this huge security hole on every Windows system that's installing.
[00:51:40.520 --> 00:51:44.440]   Now, here's the latest that just came out today from Mark Reissinovich.
[00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:46.600]   As we take this, it came out on Friday.
[00:51:46.600 --> 00:51:48.680]   He said it's also phoning home.
[00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:52.080]   Every time you play a Sony disc, it's calling.
[00:51:52.080 --> 00:51:53.960]   Sony is saying what songs you're listening to.
[00:51:53.960 --> 00:51:57.760]   See, the marketing people at Sony is going, hey, this is, you know, we're trying to figure
[00:51:57.760 --> 00:52:00.320]   out how many people are actually listening to our audio on computers.
[00:52:00.320 --> 00:52:01.320]   Isn't this great?
[00:52:01.320 --> 00:52:02.320]   You know?
[00:52:02.320 --> 00:52:07.760]   I think there's like this weird, like, mismatch because Sony started out as a hardware company
[00:52:07.760 --> 00:52:10.160]   and then they decided to get into the content business.
[00:52:10.160 --> 00:52:11.400]   So it's kind of like--
[00:52:11.400 --> 00:52:16.280]   They got-- I think my impression is they got into the content business because they
[00:52:16.280 --> 00:52:19.360]   needed-- they had-- they lost on the hardware business because they didn't have--
[00:52:19.360 --> 00:52:20.360]   Have enough content.
[00:52:20.360 --> 00:52:24.520]   They had beta maxed ones and they were like, we're always going to be self-sufficient.
[00:52:24.520 --> 00:52:25.520]   You know?
[00:52:25.520 --> 00:52:30.040]   And that's the same way that Apple had trouble and now they have lots of their own software.
[00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:33.320]   And that's the same approach in certain ways.
[00:52:33.320 --> 00:52:37.120]   Really, if they knew what they were talking about, they would be even more culpable because
[00:52:37.120 --> 00:52:39.360]   this thing is so badly written and so appalling.
[00:52:39.360 --> 00:52:43.880]   For instance, if you pull it out, if you do want it, if you manage to uninstall it, it
[00:52:43.880 --> 00:52:44.880]   breaks your CD.
[00:52:44.880 --> 00:52:45.880]   You can no longer see your CD, but--
[00:52:45.880 --> 00:52:46.880]   Whatever.
[00:52:46.880 --> 00:52:47.880]   Because it's patched.
[00:52:47.880 --> 00:52:51.800]   This is just another good reason not to buy any more CDs.
[00:52:51.800 --> 00:52:52.800]   No more Sony CDs.
[00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:53.800]   Certainly.
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:54.800]   I'm one back to the Apple.
[00:52:54.800 --> 00:52:56.440]   Well, no, the property opens all the time just randomly.
[00:52:56.440 --> 00:52:57.440]   It's going that way.
[00:52:57.440 --> 00:53:00.560]   Going to the Apple's is not the best option because the audio quality isn't as high as
[00:53:00.560 --> 00:53:01.560]   it could or should be.
[00:53:01.560 --> 00:53:02.560]   It isn't.
[00:53:02.560 --> 00:53:05.640]   Well, I would certainly say stop playing CDs on your computer.
[00:53:05.640 --> 00:53:09.320]   In fact, don't play DVDs on your computer too because there's a similar thing that happens
[00:53:09.320 --> 00:53:10.320]   with this interactual player.
[00:53:10.320 --> 00:53:13.240]   There's a much better lesson here.
[00:53:13.240 --> 00:53:14.240]   Buy a Mac.
[00:53:14.240 --> 00:53:16.240]   Well, that's a good question.
[00:53:16.240 --> 00:53:19.040]   I mean, we don't know because there's no root kit revealer for the Mac.
[00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:20.520]   I don't think it's actually possible.
[00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:22.280]   Well, if you buy music from Sony that has this--
[00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:23.280]   It's possible on any system.
[00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:26.160]   In fact, the original root kits were designed for Unix systems.
[00:53:26.160 --> 00:53:27.480]   It is absolutely possible.
[00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:28.480]   All it is is back-catching the kernel.
[00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:31.720]   I guess there's still less to ask you because Apple, every time it goes into that, it's
[00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:35.000]   going to-- Apple's going to keep on asking you, are you sure you want to do this?
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:36.000]   And do you have to get a little bit of--
[00:53:36.000 --> 00:53:37.720]   But once you patch the kernel, all bets are off.
[00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:41.120]   It doesn't matter because they can patch the kernel to stop asking you.
[00:53:41.120 --> 00:53:42.120]   They can do anything they want.
[00:53:42.120 --> 00:53:46.160]   But if you take any of these disks and just pop it in your system and have say, iTunes,
[00:53:46.160 --> 00:53:48.160]   you know, Rip it, you're fine.
[00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:51.120]   Well, it was in the whole purpose of this to hide the CD.
[00:53:51.120 --> 00:53:52.800]   This is to keep it from being ripped.
[00:53:52.800 --> 00:53:53.800]   Yeah.
[00:53:53.800 --> 00:53:56.040]   I mean, now I don't know if this works on these.
[00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:57.040]   There you have.
[00:53:57.040 --> 00:53:58.040]   It does not extend to CDs.
[00:53:58.040 --> 00:53:59.040]   It's not a digital.
[00:53:59.040 --> 00:54:00.040]   It's an analog thing.
[00:54:00.040 --> 00:54:02.040]   And by the way, they're trying to plug the analog.
[00:54:02.040 --> 00:54:04.040]   I'm going to get to that in a little bit too.
[00:54:04.040 --> 00:54:05.640]   That's a huge story.
[00:54:05.640 --> 00:54:09.520]   This is a bad week for civil libertarians.
[00:54:09.520 --> 00:54:11.920]   It's a bad week for American citizens.
[00:54:11.920 --> 00:54:12.920]   I agree.
[00:54:12.920 --> 00:54:14.480]   Whether they respect their rights or not.
[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:15.480]   I agree.
[00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:19.400]   In the past, remember, holding down the shift key would prevent this software from running
[00:54:19.400 --> 00:54:20.600]   because it prevents auto runs.
[00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:25.000]   So if you want to listen to a content-enhanced CD, hold the shift key down.
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:26.960]   I still wouldn't put it on my computer.
[00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:30.880]   And I presume if you say no to the EULA, the license agreement, nothing will happen.
[00:54:30.880 --> 00:54:31.880]   We can only hope.
[00:54:31.880 --> 00:54:32.880]   But it's just a problem.
[00:54:32.880 --> 00:54:34.640]   It'll probably just spit your CD back out.
[00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:35.640]   There is a patch.
[00:54:35.640 --> 00:54:41.960]   Sony, the company that wrote this, XPC Aurora, is offering a service pack one for the car.
[00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:44.160]   Because they found a better way to hide it.
[00:54:44.160 --> 00:54:45.840]   OK, we'll take that one out.
[00:54:45.840 --> 00:54:49.000]   I don't trust them, but they say it makes it so that you can remove it.
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   It's 3.5 megabytes.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   It's a huge download.
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   A service pack for a root kit?
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   Yeah.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:56.000]   A service pack for a root kit.
[00:54:56.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   That sounds dangerous.
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:54:58.000]   That's all I'm saying.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:55:01.200]   We'll put links to Mark Risenovich's blog postings because that was really the most
[00:55:01.200 --> 00:55:05.560]   complete and I urge people also to listen to security now because Steve and I talked
[00:55:05.560 --> 00:55:07.160]   about it quite a bit.
[00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:10.960]   Somebody else went out and went to a record store with a list of the name of the CDs that
[00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:11.960]   had this on them.
[00:55:11.960 --> 00:55:15.560]   I was like, I understand there's supposed to be a U-L icon read according to Sony's website.
[00:55:15.560 --> 00:55:16.560]   Which there is.
[00:55:16.560 --> 00:55:18.760]   And then people in the store are like, huh?
[00:55:18.760 --> 00:55:19.760]   You know what I mean?
[00:55:19.760 --> 00:55:21.560]   It's just not printed on the label.
[00:55:21.560 --> 00:55:26.720]   So I hope there's serious repercussions for Sony for this because this is just bad
[00:55:26.720 --> 00:55:27.720]   corporate behavior.
[00:55:27.720 --> 00:55:29.560]   I'm not picking the PS to the...
[00:55:29.560 --> 00:55:34.600]   John was playing for us and you might want to play a little bit of this Ted Stevens,
[00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:39.560]   who is from Alaska, although I was confused earlier.
[00:55:39.560 --> 00:55:42.560]   He's on the... is he the chairman of the telecommunications committee?
[00:55:42.560 --> 00:55:44.120]   Indeed.
[00:55:44.120 --> 00:55:51.960]   And the guy who is spearheading the new telecommunications bill this week, the Senate voted... well,
[00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:55.000]   actually they didn't vote to eliminate the net neutrality provisions.
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:56.160]   They just didn't vote to include it.
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:57.160]   It was a Thai vote.
[00:55:57.160 --> 00:55:58.160]   Yeah, 11/11.
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:56:00.640]   The committee couldn't agree.
[00:56:00.640 --> 00:56:02.280]   So it needs to be a majority to put it in.
[00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:04.280]   So the net neutrality provision is gone.
[00:56:04.280 --> 00:56:12.680]   And we have, I think, this fascinating explanation of net neutrality from Senator Stevens.
[00:56:12.680 --> 00:56:18.240]   What the senators talking about is allowing all of these entities that support this to
[00:56:18.240 --> 00:56:23.640]   provide streaming stuff going on the internet.
[00:56:23.640 --> 00:56:26.400]   Now, the internet, you know, let's go back.
[00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:33.280]   That started with a concept of local to local connections across the country.
[00:56:33.280 --> 00:56:38.160]   And you could go for air Alaska, but you only had to go through local connections to get
[00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:44.960]   their industry wisely provided for streaming, in fact, a new kind of long distance.
[00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:46.280]   And that's what we've got.
[00:56:46.280 --> 00:56:50.040]   We've got a service that's immune to distance.
[00:56:50.040 --> 00:56:52.400]   And it's there for the consumer.
[00:56:52.400 --> 00:57:04.280]   But when we take and really indicate that anyone that wants to use this system for massive,
[00:57:04.280 --> 00:57:09.000]   massive commercial purposes, there's one company now.
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:17.640]   You can sign up and you've got a movie delivered to your house daily by my subscription service,
[00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:18.880]   by delivery service.
[00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:20.400]   Okay?
[00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:25.600]   And currently it comes to your house, put in a mailbox where you get home and enter your
[00:57:25.600 --> 00:57:28.000]   monthly, you change your order.
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.080]   But you pay for that, right?
[00:57:30.080 --> 00:57:32.560]   This service is now going to go through the internet.
[00:57:32.560 --> 00:57:37.440]   And what you do is you just go to a place on the internet and you order your movie.
[00:57:37.440 --> 00:57:38.920]   And guess what?
[00:57:38.920 --> 00:57:43.680]   You can order 10 of them and the delivery charge is free, right?
[00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:47.480]   10 movies streaming across that internet.
[00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:50.280]   And what happens to your own personal internet?
[00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:54.600]   I just the other day got an internet was sent by my staff at 10 o'clock in the morning
[00:57:54.600 --> 00:57:55.600]   of Friday.
[00:57:55.600 --> 00:57:57.400]   I got it yesterday.
[00:57:57.400 --> 00:57:58.400]   Why?
[00:57:58.400 --> 00:58:02.840]   Because it got tangled up with all these things that are going on the internet commercially.
[00:58:02.840 --> 00:58:08.520]   And here we have this one situation where enormous entities want to use the internet for their
[00:58:08.520 --> 00:58:12.080]   purpose to save money for doing what they're doing now.
[00:58:12.080 --> 00:58:13.080]   They use FedEx.
[00:58:13.080 --> 00:58:15.320]   They use the delivery services.
[00:58:15.320 --> 00:58:17.280]   They use the mail.
[00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:18.880]   They deliver in other ways.
[00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:23.200]   But they want to deliver vast amounts of information over the internet.
[00:58:23.200 --> 00:58:27.200]   And again, the internet is not something that you just dump something on.
[00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:28.520]   It's not a big truck.
[00:58:28.520 --> 00:58:30.240]   It's a series of tubes.
[00:58:30.240 --> 00:58:33.840]   And if you don't understand those tubes can be filled.
[00:58:33.840 --> 00:58:37.200]   And if they're filled, when you put your message in, it gets in line.
[00:58:37.200 --> 00:58:40.240]   It's going to be delayed by anyone that puts in that tube.
[00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:41.840]   An enormous amounts of material.
[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:45.440]   It reminds me of that old April Fool's Gag.
[00:58:45.440 --> 00:58:49.960]   It said, years ago, where I said these guys were trying to pass a law saying, you can't
[00:58:49.960 --> 00:58:52.320]   be drunk when you're using a modem.
[00:58:52.320 --> 00:58:55.200]   It's driving it on the information superhighway.
[00:58:55.200 --> 00:58:57.600]   I could actually see these guys doing it.
[00:58:57.600 --> 00:59:02.360]   Now look, Stevens is one of the three oldest senators.
[00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:04.200]   Obviously he didn't grow up with the internet.
[00:59:04.200 --> 00:59:05.760]   He didn't even grow old with the internet.
[00:59:05.760 --> 00:59:06.760]   I mean, the internet is--
[00:59:06.760 --> 00:59:07.760]   He doesn't use the internet period.
[00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:09.400]   He doesn't even use it.
[00:59:09.400 --> 00:59:12.240]   And he's-- oh, that's right.
[00:59:12.240 --> 00:59:14.760]   He's the guy who was trying to sneak the broadcast flag into the--
[00:59:14.760 --> 00:59:15.760]   Yeah.
[00:59:15.760 --> 00:59:16.760]   --through the quality bill.
[00:59:16.760 --> 00:59:17.760]   Exactly.
[00:59:17.760 --> 00:59:19.040]   He's a weenie.
[00:59:19.040 --> 00:59:20.600]   Exactly.
[00:59:20.600 --> 00:59:24.080]   You did blog this week about Kevin's cover.
[00:59:24.080 --> 00:59:26.600]   And we might as well just start off with that.
[00:59:26.600 --> 00:59:28.400]   I'm first of all, Kevin.
[00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:30.000]   Embarrassed or not, I think it's wonderful.
[00:59:30.000 --> 00:59:32.200]   I mean, you're getting a lot of recognition from Business Week.
[00:59:32.200 --> 00:59:34.560]   It was kind of the counting in the article
[00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:36.400]   is a little strange as they pointed out in the article.
[00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:38.320]   Your dig is breaking even.
[00:59:38.320 --> 00:59:41.520]   But on the front page, they say, this kid made $60 million
[00:59:41.520 --> 00:59:42.720]   in 18 months.
[00:59:42.720 --> 00:59:44.720]   Actually, a dig isn't even breaking even.
[00:59:44.720 --> 00:59:45.880]   So they got that right.
[00:59:45.880 --> 00:59:48.120]   Hey, Kevin, you're taking us out to dinner
[00:59:48.120 --> 00:59:49.440]   tonight with all that money?
[00:59:49.440 --> 00:59:50.680]   $60 million.
[00:59:50.680 --> 00:59:52.440]   I have no-- there's no--
[00:59:52.440 --> 00:59:53.480]   I'm not a multi-millionaire.
[00:59:53.480 --> 00:59:55.720]   I'm not even a millionaire or 1,000aire.
[00:59:55.720 --> 00:59:58.280]   I don't know how they came up with that cover.
[00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:01.200]   But I guess it was just based on--
[01:00:01.200 --> 01:00:03.000]   they put a value to the company.
[01:00:03.000 --> 01:00:04.280]   And then they came out $100 million.
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:05.200]   And you have $100 million.
[01:00:05.200 --> 01:00:06.120]   And you estimated how much?
[01:00:06.120 --> 01:00:06.320]   Yeah.
[01:00:06.320 --> 01:00:07.360]   It's all estimates.
[01:00:07.360 --> 01:00:09.720]   And obviously, it's just paper fake money.
[01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:12.120]   Hey, I thought, Leo, you kind of liked that piece.
[01:00:12.120 --> 01:00:13.680]   I thought the article read like it,
[01:00:13.680 --> 01:00:16.160]   like a slip shot hit piece.
[01:00:16.160 --> 01:00:16.640]   Really?
[01:00:16.640 --> 01:00:17.640]   I think it was a hit piece.
[01:00:17.640 --> 01:00:19.080]   I would seem like it to me.
[01:00:19.080 --> 01:00:20.000]   It was snide.
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:21.480]   He called him a kid.
[01:00:21.480 --> 01:00:24.600]   I mean, the guy-- you know, Kevin's 30 or close to it.
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:26.360]   And I mean, if you look on the pictures,
[01:00:26.360 --> 01:00:28.400]   he's got a six o'clock shadow for God's sake.
[01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:30.360]   I mean, it doesn't even look like he's young in that thing,
[01:00:30.360 --> 01:00:31.640]   except for the crazy outfit.
[01:00:31.640 --> 01:00:32.280]   And they called him--
[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:33.160]   And then they had all these--
[01:00:33.160 --> 01:00:33.920]   Tom Crohn's about--
[01:00:33.920 --> 01:00:35.480]   His doughy, your little brother.
[01:00:35.480 --> 01:00:36.240]   And they were snugg.
[01:00:36.240 --> 01:00:38.320]   Yeah, and then about the tech TV loser,
[01:00:38.320 --> 01:00:42.120]   kind of a loser on tech TV, you know, with unknown--
[01:00:42.120 --> 01:00:44.600]   I mean, the whole thing was just rang.
[01:00:44.600 --> 01:00:45.240]   You know what?
[01:00:45.240 --> 01:00:45.760]   You're right.
[01:00:45.760 --> 01:00:48.600]   I'm mad as hell now.
[01:00:48.600 --> 01:00:50.040]   I'm mad.
[01:00:50.040 --> 01:00:51.120]   Dang it.
[01:00:51.120 --> 01:00:54.320]   It was pretty crazy how they came up with that cover shot.
[01:00:54.320 --> 01:00:57.480]   So the whole deal was going into this.
[01:00:57.480 --> 01:00:59.480]   Honestly, it was just an interview for--
[01:00:59.480 --> 01:01:01.800]   we were going to be one of the companies featured
[01:01:01.800 --> 01:01:02.600]   in the article.
[01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:05.200]   We had no idea it was going to be a cover or anything like that
[01:01:05.200 --> 01:01:07.560]   until the actual day that it went out to press.
[01:01:07.560 --> 01:01:08.040]   So--
[01:01:08.040 --> 01:01:09.840]   Oh, they didn't even warn you before that?
[01:01:09.840 --> 01:01:12.080]   No, they said there's a possibility it might be.
[01:01:12.080 --> 01:01:15.360]   But we want to take a photo of you come out.
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:18.240]   And it's for the inside of the magazine.
[01:01:18.240 --> 01:01:20.360]   Just there's guys walking their dogs.
[01:01:20.360 --> 01:01:22.000]   There's guys with hockey gear on.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:22.840]   Do something fun.
[01:01:22.840 --> 01:01:24.600]   So they're all throwing some headphones.
[01:01:24.600 --> 01:01:27.200]   And just give us a couple of different poses.
[01:01:27.200 --> 01:01:30.280]   Did they give you the backwards cap or was that your idea?
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:31.560]   No, they basically-- I mean, they
[01:01:31.560 --> 01:01:33.240]   had me drinking a beer.
[01:01:33.240 --> 01:01:35.720]   They had me doing all different kinds of things.
[01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:38.040]   And they're just like, we'll see which one everyone makes it.
[01:01:38.040 --> 01:01:38.520]   Kevin, you're--
[01:01:38.520 --> 01:01:41.040]   If I get you to try one of those crazy tennis shoe
[01:01:41.040 --> 01:01:43.000]   lakings and all the kids are into these things--
[01:01:43.000 --> 01:01:45.560]   [LAUGHTER]
[01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:47.280]   No, I didn't have to do that.
[01:01:47.280 --> 01:01:49.200]   You've got to get a handler drive line somewhere.
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:49.840]   You need a man.
[01:01:49.840 --> 01:01:51.920]   You need somebody to protect you from this stuff.
[01:01:51.920 --> 01:01:53.120]   I don't know.
[01:01:53.120 --> 01:01:55.280]   It is a mixed blessing, though, to be on the cover
[01:01:55.280 --> 01:01:56.280]   of business week before.
[01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:56.280]   Of course.
[01:01:56.280 --> 01:01:58.000]   I mean, I'm honored to be on the cover.
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:01:59.440]   But I mean, I was--
[01:01:59.440 --> 01:02:02.560]   with the whole 60 million-- this kid made $60 million.
[01:02:02.560 --> 01:02:04.080]   I didn't make anything.
[01:02:04.080 --> 01:02:08.320]   The company-- while we have a path to becoming a profitable
[01:02:08.320 --> 01:02:10.760]   company, we are not a profitable company.
[01:02:10.760 --> 01:02:14.200]   We're continuing to work on that with Federated Media
[01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:16.160]   and some other companies that we're
[01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:18.840]   signed up with to sort of ads on the page.
[01:02:18.840 --> 01:02:20.160]   And--
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:21.840]   Go Federated Media.
[01:02:21.840 --> 01:02:22.240]   What's that?
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:24.280]   This is John Battelle's company.
[01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:26.360]   They sell banner ads, right?
[01:02:26.360 --> 01:02:27.240]   Yeah, exactly.
[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:28.360]   Go Federated Media.
[01:02:28.360 --> 01:02:29.840]   And why do you say that, Corey?
[01:02:29.840 --> 01:02:33.680]   Well, because that's what Bling Bling gets its money, too.
[01:02:33.680 --> 01:02:34.680]   Oh, all right.
[01:02:34.680 --> 01:02:35.680]   Good.
[01:02:35.680 --> 01:02:36.600]   Is Bling Bling all Federated Media?
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:37.960]   You don't have anybody else on there?
[01:02:37.960 --> 01:02:38.480]   Yeah.
[01:02:38.480 --> 01:02:38.960]   Well, no.
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:40.880]   So it's a little complex, because John's also
[01:02:40.880 --> 01:02:42.480]   personally our business manager.
[01:02:42.480 --> 01:02:45.520]   So I think he occasionally does deals on our behalf
[01:02:45.520 --> 01:02:47.200]   with entities other than Federated Media,
[01:02:47.200 --> 01:02:48.960]   but it's pretty much all Federated Media.
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:50.760]   Battelle was a journalist.
[01:02:50.760 --> 01:02:51.200]   Yeah.
[01:02:51.200 --> 01:02:54.440]   Well, in an entrepreneur, he's found that the industry standard.
[01:02:54.440 --> 01:02:57.240]   It's kind of an interesting thing, though, now he's selling--
[01:02:57.240 --> 01:03:00.080]   Kevin, did you prefer the alternative cover that Go Pasted?
[01:03:00.080 --> 01:03:01.320]   What was the alternate cover?
[01:03:01.320 --> 01:03:04.760]   Yes, the-- you mean the 40-year-old virgin one?
[01:03:04.760 --> 01:03:05.760]   Yeah, yeah.
[01:03:05.760 --> 01:03:07.000]   The comparison.
[01:03:07.000 --> 01:03:08.920]   Stripes shirt, stripes shirt.
[01:03:08.920 --> 01:03:09.680]   That was awesome.
[01:03:09.680 --> 01:03:10.200]   Wait a minute.
[01:03:10.200 --> 01:03:10.760]   Where is that?
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:11.280]   I didn't see that.
[01:03:11.280 --> 01:03:12.240]   Was that on dig?
[01:03:12.240 --> 01:03:15.080]   Yeah, there's a bunch of different alternatives
[01:03:15.080 --> 01:03:17.080]   out there, which are just amazing.
[01:03:17.080 --> 01:03:17.720]   They're really cool.
[01:03:17.720 --> 01:03:19.320]   A bunch of people Photoshop.
[01:03:19.320 --> 01:03:20.840]   Oh, my goodness.
[01:03:20.840 --> 01:03:24.240]   Well, I think in some ways, this kind of attention
[01:03:24.240 --> 01:03:27.760]   is a bad thing for a company, because it puts pressure on you.
[01:03:27.760 --> 01:03:30.320]   Of course, a lot of weasels come out of the woodwork
[01:03:30.320 --> 01:03:33.640]   saying, hey, kid, I can have for you about $60 million.
[01:03:33.640 --> 01:03:36.080]   Actually, the day it was posted, I
[01:03:36.080 --> 01:03:38.560]   had someone from Goldman Sachs email me, like, hey,
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:41.440]   if you need money, man, I'm like, I can't even afford a couch.
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:43.160]   I just moved into my new apartment.
[01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:44.600]   Leave me alone.
[01:03:44.600 --> 01:03:46.280]   I don't have $60 million.
[01:03:46.280 --> 01:03:47.080]   Oh, sure.
[01:03:47.080 --> 01:03:49.880]   It's going to be an avalanche at some point of stuff.
[01:03:49.880 --> 01:03:51.040]   Yeah, it was pretty fun, isn't it?
[01:03:51.040 --> 01:03:53.240]   Well, you know, after listening to that,
[01:03:53.240 --> 01:03:56.320]   it reminds me really that there are so many moments.
[01:03:56.320 --> 01:03:59.240]   There's quite a few that are missing from that.
[01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:00.320]   But it's great to hear those.
[01:04:00.320 --> 01:04:03.680]   And I thank Joe Kelly for putting that together in JK software.
[01:04:03.680 --> 01:04:04.720]   A great job.
[01:04:04.720 --> 01:04:06.920]   And maybe we'll just have to do another one with some
[01:04:06.920 --> 01:04:08.640]   of the other great moments.
[01:04:08.640 --> 01:04:11.200]   Your nominations are appreciated.
[01:04:11.200 --> 01:04:13.800]   Thank you so much for all of your support.
[01:04:13.800 --> 01:04:18.400]   And another 75 tweets ahead, at least.
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:19.200]   I'm Leo de Forten.
[01:04:19.200 --> 01:04:23.240]   It's just time for me to say another tweet is in the can.
[01:04:23.240 --> 01:04:24.240]   Take care.
[01:04:24.240 --> 01:04:25.720]   All right.
[01:04:25.720 --> 01:04:27.080]   I should have paid attention.
[01:04:27.080 --> 01:04:28.240]   I don't know what I'm going to do.
[01:04:28.240 --> 01:04:32.020]   much work, the problem is, there is no limit. My server is completely collapsed.
[01:04:32.020 --> 01:04:36.040]   So, here the deal… I'm just trying to get the thing off. But I have a hell of a time
[01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:40.700]   when blue screens like forget it… I'm killing you!
[01:04:40.700 --> 01:05:09.680]   [music]
[01:05:09.680 --> 01:05:19.680]   [music]
[01:05:19.680 --> 01:05:26.680]   [music]
[01:05:26.680 --> 01:05:33.680]   [music]
[01:05:33.680 --> 01:05:38.680]   [music]
[01:05:38.680 --> 01:05:43.680]   [music]
[01:05:43.680 --> 01:05:48.680]   [music]
[01:05:48.680 --> 01:05:53.680]   [music]
[01:05:53.680 --> 01:05:57.680]   [music]
[01:05:57.680 --> 01:06:00.680]   [music]

[01:06:03.680 --> 01:06:13.680]   [music]
[01:06:13.680 --> 01:06:20.680]   [music]
[01:06:20.680 --> 01:06:24.680]   [music]
[01:06:24.680 --> 01:06:27.680]   [music]
[01:06:27.680 --> 01:06:32.680]   [music]
[01:06:32.680 --> 01:06:35.020]   --D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D-D.
[01:06:35.020 --> 01:06:35.780]   Round the horn.
[01:06:35.780 --> 01:06:39.600]   Do the "Twit".
[01:06:39.600 --> 01:06:41.020]   Alright!
[01:06:41.020 --> 01:06:44.200]   Do the "Twit".
[01:06:44.200 --> 01:06:44.680]   Alright!
[01:06:44.680 --> 01:06:47.900]   Do the "Twit".
[01:06:47.900 --> 01:06:48.440]   Alright!
[01:06:48.440 --> 01:06:52.380]   Alright!
[01:06:52.380 --> 01:06:55.320]   Do the "Twi".
[01:06:55.320 --> 01:06:55.820]   Alright!
[01:06:55.820 --> 01:06:59.080]   Do the "Twit".
[01:06:59.080 --> 01:07:01.580]   Baby!
[01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:02.620]   Do the "Twit".
[01:07:02.620 --> 01:07:03.120]   Alright!
[01:07:03.120 --> 01:07:04.840]   Do the "Twit", baby!
[01:07:04.840 --> 01:07:06.280]   Do the "Twit".
[01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:06.780]   Alright!
[01:07:06.780 --> 01:07:08.580]   Do the "Twit", baby!
[01:07:08.580 --> 01:07:09.960]   Do the "Twit".
[01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:10.460]   Alright!
[01:07:10.460 --> 01:07:11.860]   Do the "Twit".
[01:07:11.860 --> 01:07:12.360]   Baby!
[01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:13.120]   I did it!
[01:07:13.120 --> 01:07:13.620]   But no!
[01:07:13.620 --> 01:07:14.440]   Bam!
[01:07:14.440 --> 01:07:15.460]   F*ck off!
[01:07:15.460 --> 01:07:16.460]   Who would say...
