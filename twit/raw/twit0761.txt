[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.760]   It's time for Twet this week in Tech. Lots to talk about with our panelists,
[00:00:03.760 --> 00:00:09.680]   Brianna Wu. She's running for Congress in Massachusetts. Paris Martynau, she writes it wired,
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:16.160]   and Seth Weintraub. He's the founder of 9-5 Google, Mac, and Electric. We'll talk about the
[00:00:16.160 --> 00:00:24.880]   coronavirus craziness. Baby Yoda Toys may be delayed. We'll also talk about Apple and push
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:31.680]   notifications. Apparently, they're changing their tune. Amazingly enough, the music industry,
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.680]   it's healthier than it's been in years. It's all coming up next on Twet. This week,

[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:59.600]   this fabulous panel. Brianna Wu is here in the middle of a stump speech. She's running for
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:05.920]   Congress in the Massachusetts 8th. When's election day? It is September 1st. So we are working right
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:11.360]   now to get on the ballot. On the very first day, we're out there working. We got about half the
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.840]   signatures we needed. So it's going amazing. Well, that's great. And we're also opening up our
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:20.560]   second office next week. So I'm very excited about that. And the nice thing about running for
[00:03:20.560 --> 00:03:25.440]   Congress is you can paper your walls with campaign signs. That's true. That's true. I have a beautiful
[00:03:25.440 --> 00:03:31.520]   American flag. I have some TV stuff later today. And we were redoing the office. So I thought this
[00:03:31.520 --> 00:03:36.080]   would look interesting. You have a TV stuff right now. Thank you, Brianna. I'm thrilled to have you
[00:03:36.080 --> 00:03:41.920]   on as always. Also joining us. He was the creator of 9 to 5 Mac. He also is the editor in chief
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:49.520]   at Electric. It is Seth Winetrop. Great to have you with us. Great to be back. Yay. He's in the attic.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:55.520]   You got stuck in the attic today. Did you know the low ceilings? Yeah, I could tell.
[00:03:56.800 --> 00:04:03.920]   I'm an expert. But I thought that Paris Martenau is also joining us from her home. I thought
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.480]   she was in her home office. She's a staff writer at wire, but she says this is her mid-century living
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:14.240]   room. Yeah, very different thing. Hi, guys. Always great to be here. Great to have you.
[00:04:14.240 --> 00:04:20.080]   This is the crew, the social distancing crew. I'll tell you what, we're all very good at this.
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:25.200]   We were just looking at the XKCD article. You started it, I think, Brianna, by saying you've been
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:30.240]   bearing your whole life for this. That's true. That's exactly. I'm really worried, though,
[00:04:30.240 --> 00:04:36.000]   because my whole job is going out to large crowds now. I'm really scared. I was talking to people
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:41.120]   yesterday. Every day I talked to, I said, "Let's just do the coronavirus elbow bump." That's what
[00:04:41.120 --> 00:04:47.040]   I did. Do you still have people showing up? Oh, absolutely. I would think this is going to get
[00:04:47.040 --> 00:04:53.520]   harder and harder. Here it is yesterday's XKCD called Self-Isolate Guy Sitting and Looking at a TV.
[00:04:53.520 --> 00:04:56.960]   Experts are saying people may need to self-isolate to combat the virus.
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:04.240]   He sits there. I've been practicing for this moment my whole life. I don't think that's quick.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:09.920]   Make plans. Watch how fast I cancel. I think there are a lot of us geeks who are finally going
[00:05:09.920 --> 00:05:19.520]   to have enough TV time. Enough time to play with my Raspberry Pi. Anyway, I should mention we are
[00:05:19.520 --> 00:05:24.880]   closing our studio for the time being. If you had tickets to come see us, I apologize.
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:31.280]   Really, in respect of the staff, as much as anything, I want to make sure that they stay healthy.
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:38.560]   We won't have studio audiences. I suspect we will only have people via Skype sitting around the table
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:43.440]   just to protect. Although I was in St. Louis, as we actually have gotten an airplane,
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:49.200]   flew to St. Louis, did an event at our sponsor Worldwide Text Facility, beautiful facility,
[00:05:49.200 --> 00:05:52.800]   and flew back. I'm still here.
[00:05:52.800 --> 00:05:58.800]   What will your temperature be in 14 days, L.A. That's the question.
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:05.200]   Good news. The Pope is okay. Italy is... Although he's not in Lombardi, which is, I think,
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:11.840]   the region that is most affected. But he is testing negative for coronavirus, according to
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:18.240]   Italy. We've also talked to Father Robert Ballisair, who is at the Vatican, and he's okay too.
[00:06:19.120 --> 00:06:23.760]   Actually, it would be a serious thing for the Pope. He's 83 years old. He had part of a lung
[00:06:23.760 --> 00:06:32.160]   remove several decades ago. He has actually started to cancel audiences, not just papal audiences,
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:37.840]   conferences being in cancel, including a bit of a shock, South by Southwest.
[00:06:37.840 --> 00:06:39.920]   First time in 34 years.
[00:06:39.920 --> 00:06:44.720]   Well, it's hard to think of another reason why they would cancel it, to be honest with you.
[00:06:45.680 --> 00:06:49.680]   I mean, that's not... I don't know. They take a year off, because something happens.
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:55.840]   I got the impression from the cancellation that South by didn't want to cancel. They really
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.800]   waited a lot. It was a very passive, aggressive kind of cancellation message. It was like,
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:05.840]   "We really didn't want to do this. We didn't make the decision. The city said we didn't have to,
[00:07:05.840 --> 00:07:08.480]   but then they said we should probably do it."
[00:07:08.480 --> 00:07:12.080]   Oh, so the city... I see, I thought Austin made him do it.
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:18.000]   So the city said... That doesn't say Austin made them do it, is essentially what they'd said
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:23.200]   towards the end of it. But it was a strange message, because I think it began by saying,
[00:07:23.200 --> 00:07:28.960]   "Oh, just as early as last week, the city had said we were going to be fine. Everything was good."
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:34.960]   But now the city is saying, "We have to do this. Public security and health risk," which like,
[00:07:34.960 --> 00:07:41.840]   duh, clearly. And it didn't help that Facebook, Twitter, Netflix, BMI, the music company,
[00:07:41.840 --> 00:07:45.200]   because there's a music festival too. And Apple had all pulled out.
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:49.520]   Not going to be a much of an event with that, all of that.
[00:07:49.520 --> 00:07:51.280]   Yeah, that's probably the real reason.
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:58.160]   There's nothing worse than having a conference, and just nobody's there.
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:06.080]   There's no booths. There's no panels. That would look almost even worse. But I have to feel for the
[00:08:06.080 --> 00:08:14.240]   people in Austin. Yeah, I mean, so many people, local business owners and whatnot,
[00:08:14.240 --> 00:08:17.680]   this is where you make all of your money for the whole year in Austin.
[00:08:17.680 --> 00:08:20.800]   And I'm devastating for everyone who's counting on revenue.
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:26.960]   We've got... I have friends of mine that have TV shows and documentaries down there that they
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:35.840]   are really trying to get sold. So I kind of fear talking about this in terms of a financial
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:40.240]   damage to people, but it's very real and not just to corporations.
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:41.920]   Why would you move... Individuals.
[00:08:41.920 --> 00:08:45.360]   Yeah, you feel if you talk about the economic consequences, you're downplaying
[00:08:45.360 --> 00:08:49.920]   the health consequences? I just think... I want to be very careful and say,
[00:08:49.920 --> 00:08:54.960]   it's people's health's first, people's lives first. That's the top priority here,
[00:08:54.960 --> 00:08:57.680]   but this is clearly another important thing to talk about.
[00:08:57.680 --> 00:09:04.000]   Well, you're being politic, but it is really bad for... Well, podcast advertising is disappearing.
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:07.520]   Movies... James Bond movie.
[00:09:07.520 --> 00:09:11.520]   Well, we ever do. Having to wait six months for a game.
[00:09:11.520 --> 00:09:12.560]   Come on, that's a big deal.
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:16.480]   They was going to come out this spring. They've deferred it to November.
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:20.960]   Now, somebody said it's because of the title, which is something like...
[00:09:20.960 --> 00:09:24.640]   I mean, I think it's because... It's a good day to sicken and die or something.
[00:09:24.640 --> 00:09:30.080]   For all the people who are sick nowadays, a large, like, a large, large part of your
[00:09:30.080 --> 00:09:34.960]   revenue is going to be coming from audiences in China. And if no one in China is being allowed
[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:39.040]   to leave their homes and go congregate in public space with other people, why would you release
[00:09:39.040 --> 00:09:42.080]   your movie when half of your revenue is not going to be there?
[00:09:42.080 --> 00:09:47.840]   Yeah, no. I mean, that's serious. That's nothing to be sneezed at if you forgive it.
[00:09:47.840 --> 00:09:51.120]   We're saying all these things, but public health is first. That's a good...
[00:09:51.120 --> 00:09:59.760]   At the same time, I think there's some benefits. Apparently, lobster prices are dropping in
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:05.360]   a mess. Choose it. I saw that. I saw that. I live here. I can get lobster whenever I want.
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:08.080]   So I wasn't very surprised, excited by that.
[00:10:08.080 --> 00:10:08.720]   White's are really cheap.
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:10.320]   What's that?
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:14.320]   I've seen a lot of people tweeting about how flights are really cheap right now.
[00:10:14.320 --> 00:10:15.840]   Their towels are very cheap right now.
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:16.400]   Yup.
[00:10:16.400 --> 00:10:17.280]   Especially in Austin.
[00:10:17.280 --> 00:10:21.680]   No, I don't mean to make light of it because it is. You're right. Absolutely.
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:28.960]   Brian, it's a serious health issue. Although people, there are a lot of people who
[00:10:28.960 --> 00:10:34.160]   also think it's being overblown. I had somebody call the radio show yesterday who said,
[00:10:34.160 --> 00:10:39.040]   "You know, it's just the news media. It's a sensationalistic story. They're just overblowing it."
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:42.560]   And I said, "Oh, are you a physician?" He said, "No, I'm a piano tuner."
[00:10:42.560 --> 00:10:44.800]   Of course. Yeah.
[00:10:44.800 --> 00:10:47.520]   So apparently the piano tuner constituents...
[00:10:47.520 --> 00:10:48.480]   I think that person may be bad at math.
[00:10:48.480 --> 00:10:48.800]   Yeah.
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:53.680]   Is it something to be worried about? I think so. Yes?
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:58.240]   Absolutely. I mean, it's... I think the best way, the way that I've kind of explained it,
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.960]   because my father called me the other week kind of saying the same thing.
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:05.680]   And I was like, "Oh, no. I mean, I understand that for most healthy kind of young people,
[00:11:05.680 --> 00:11:09.760]   let's say if you've got coronavirus right now, you'd probably come out of it fine. You wouldn't
[00:11:09.760 --> 00:11:15.040]   need hospital assistance, hopefully. But for any immunocompromised people or
[00:11:15.040 --> 00:11:18.800]   people who aren't more elderly, it's going to be a serious health challenge.
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:24.720]   And it's kind of as if we are in a world where, let's say, the flu didn't exist and the flu for
[00:11:24.720 --> 00:11:29.120]   the first time was making its rounds. Sure. It's kind of like that, isn't it?
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:35.840]   It's kind of a world where the flu does exist. And it's a sad but just reality of our lives.
[00:11:35.840 --> 00:11:42.160]   If we are in a state currently where we can prevent another flu from being a regular occurrence,
[00:11:42.160 --> 00:11:46.960]   you're out, you're in, you're out, and having that many people die and suffer health complications.
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:50.640]   Why wouldn't we do everything to stop that? Yeah.
[00:11:50.640 --> 00:11:56.560]   I think when you really understand the exponential nature of these kinds of pandemics,
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:01.760]   there's a lot to worry about. The future, I'm really scared that we're heading towards in the
[00:12:01.760 --> 00:12:08.400]   United States is one where our hospital beds, just by doing math of how many hospital beds we have
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:14.640]   in the United States, I think it's reasonable to be concerned that they are going to be filled with
[00:12:14.640 --> 00:12:19.840]   people with coronavirus. And you start looking at our nursing shortages and how people are going
[00:12:19.840 --> 00:12:25.280]   to get health care for that. And you start thinking through, are we going to get to a point where
[00:12:25.280 --> 00:12:32.000]   hospitals are turning people away based on who they think is going to get better and who is not
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:39.040]   going to get better? You start thinking through supply change. We went over to Walgreens today,
[00:12:39.040 --> 00:12:45.120]   just trying to get some surface disinfectant wipe. It's still out of stock, dust masks are out of stock.
[00:12:45.680 --> 00:12:51.360]   And you think about the way these things are manufactured. And I think there are very reasonable
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:56.960]   fears to have about our capacity in every sense of the work, capacity for hospitals,
[00:12:56.960 --> 00:13:03.520]   capacity to create drugs, capacity for health care. I think it's really hard to overstate
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:10.160]   how serious this is. And there are also so many offshoot effects that people, I feel like,
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:14.800]   are not thinking about, we're of course talking about how there are masks shortages and disinfectant
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:18.880]   shortages. And that affects not only people who are working in the health industry and
[00:13:18.880 --> 00:13:25.520]   trying to protect themselves from coronavirus, but N95 masks are something that contractors
[00:13:25.520 --> 00:13:31.280]   need to be able to do their jobs. You can't sand certain things or do certain jobs in the
[00:13:31.280 --> 00:13:36.640]   construction industry unless you have these masks available and are able to use them. And a lot of
[00:13:36.640 --> 00:13:42.080]   people are out of work because they cannot obtain the supplies that they need to do their job.
[00:13:42.080 --> 00:13:46.480]   And that's just one example. I thought of that actually. Wow, you're a lot.
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:53.680]   It's an incredibly strange and very Brooklyn thing to say, but I work in ceramics in my free time.
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:13:59.440]   And a lot of ceramics, this are not able to complete their pottery and sell their wares because you
[00:13:59.440 --> 00:14:05.120]   need to have these sort of dust masks to sand different pots and whatnot. And so that's being
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:10.240]   put aside as well. Wow. I have the same problem.
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:16.320]   We're so interconnected nowadays. We're so interdependent that it's like the butterfly effect,
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:23.120]   except it's much more dramatic. Any little shift. How about as editor of Electric, you probably
[00:14:23.120 --> 00:14:29.440]   more aware than I am. What about, we've talked a little bit about computer production in China,
[00:14:29.440 --> 00:14:35.280]   Seth, but what about car production? Is that going to be impacted? Oh, certainly. I mean,
[00:14:35.280 --> 00:14:44.240]   any part of the supply chain stops and you're stuck. If the sea manufacturer stops,
[00:14:44.240 --> 00:14:51.200]   then there's no cars coming out. So we've already seen some slowdowns.
[00:14:51.200 --> 00:15:01.040]   Car manufacturers are already warning against quarter one slowdowns. And then the whole recession
[00:15:01.040 --> 00:15:08.160]   like theoretically coming out of this is slowing people down from making big purchases.
[00:15:08.160 --> 00:15:15.600]   So it's going to be a big deal. So whatever you think about the virus itself,
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:20.960]   whether it's going to affect how it's going to affect you directly, indirectly, because of
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:27.760]   everybody's reaction to it, it's going to be a big deal. And we saw Elon Musk saying,
[00:15:27.760 --> 00:15:33.360]   this isn't a big deal, but he's talking about, well, how is this going to affect me? How is it
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:38.880]   going to affect people around them? Ryan's and I have a lot of popcorn in many shows to watch,
[00:15:38.880 --> 00:15:45.440]   and we won't be leaving the house. So it is going to be a big deal. I think it's just,
[00:15:45.440 --> 00:15:49.600]   it's how people are going to react to it and rightly so react.
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:55.280]   Well, and a big deal not just for now, but these economic consequences reverberate for months and
[00:15:55.280 --> 00:16:01.920]   years. So the disease may go away this summer, but the consequences could last,
[00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:08.400]   we could hit a serious recession, for instance. Yeah, I mean, that's the general thought right now,
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:17.440]   that the economy has certainly slowed already. And in China, obviously, there's huge pockets of
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:23.600]   stoppages. Now, Foxconn on high precision says they're going back to work this month.
[00:16:24.160 --> 00:16:29.840]   That's important because they're the ones making the new iPhones. The rumor was that Apple would
[00:16:29.840 --> 00:16:37.200]   announce new $400 iPhones, the successor to the SE at the end of the month. I wonder though,
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:41.760]   if really they are going back to work, you get the feeling that China is a little bit like the
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:48.080]   US where there's kind of this happy glad ending that's not justified in fact.
[00:16:49.360 --> 00:16:54.080]   Yeah, absolutely. I think it's up in the air. Even if they are going back, there's probably
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:17:02.640]   some supply chain entity in the cameras or whatever that may not have gone back. And maybe
[00:17:02.640 --> 00:17:07.200]   they can get a few hundred thousand out or a couple million out, but they're probably not going to get
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:13.920]   what they expected to be able to get out the door. Two developer conferences canceled, Google I/O
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:23.200]   canceled, the conference will go remote. Facebook's F8 also canceled. This is going to be good. In
[00:17:23.200 --> 00:17:27.120]   fact, I think Zoom stock did well. This is going to be good for remote
[00:17:27.120 --> 00:17:34.560]   conferencing teleconferencing companies. I would imagine DoorDash and the other food delivery companies
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:39.760]   in fact, I think which one was it? I think it was DoorDash where they have now a new button on the
[00:17:39.760 --> 00:17:49.120]   app that says, "Leave the food and go." Oh my gosh. I do think that's, you know, I think
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:55.200]   if you're looking for a bit of a silver lining here, there are a few here. I do think one of the
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:18:02.320]   long-term consequences of this is I think we're going to finally get some remote work policies put
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:06.880]   in place for a lot of large companies. And I think that's going to be good for the workforce
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:12.000]   over a long term. I think it's going to be good for parents. And people sick. I think once we get
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:17.520]   better policies in place, I do hope that people are going to be able to take sick leave more easily.
[00:18:17.520 --> 00:18:22.400]   I think one of the most vulnerable populations with this is, as you said, Leo, people working in
[00:18:22.400 --> 00:18:28.240]   the food industry. If you're sick and you make food and you go to work, you're going to be spreading
[00:18:28.240 --> 00:18:33.120]   that to a lot of people. It doesn't matter how often you wash your hands or what precautions you
[00:18:33.120 --> 00:18:37.920]   take. You're going to be at immense risk. So I'm really hoping when it comes to manufacturing
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:42.000]   drugs here in the United States, we're going to increase our capacity when it comes to some of
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:48.400]   these policies that are common sense. Maybe this will be the spark that kind of gets us to take this
[00:18:48.400 --> 00:18:54.080]   more seriously. San Francisco's banned events for two weeks. They've declared an emergency.
[00:18:54.080 --> 00:19:00.480]   Their Stanford has canceled classes. Many companies are telling workers to stay home,
[00:19:01.440 --> 00:19:08.000]   including Twitter, Google, and Microsoft. And of course, Amazon has reported that they,
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:16.160]   in fact, do have a worker sick with coronavirus. Let me see if I can find that story. I'm not
[00:19:16.160 --> 00:19:25.040]   sure where that Amazon employee works. So this is, this is, yeah. But is it overreacting?
[00:19:25.840 --> 00:19:33.520]   No, no, no, no, no, no, Seattle employee quarantined with coronavirus. Yeah, and Twitter also announced
[00:19:33.520 --> 00:19:39.040]   in the six that Seattle based employee had been advised by their doctor that they likely had
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:44.400]   COVID-19. Seattle has been the epicenter, I think, in the west coast, certainly in the U.S. But I
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:49.040]   know there are many cases in your neck of the woods too in New York. Yeah, I think I saw something
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:55.760]   this morning that said New York is on pace to a... Yeah, I clipped Seattle.
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:20:01.200]   Oh, which is great. Yeah, that's a title you don't really want. Yeah, Westchester seems to be
[00:20:01.200 --> 00:20:09.280]   joining the elite in the coronavirus territory. You know, I don't know, but it does seem to me
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:15.760]   that it's not an accident that these are the areas where we have cases. And it's not because
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:20.640]   they're more likely to have visitors from Asia or from Italy or Iran, but it's because it's more
[00:20:20.640 --> 00:20:25.120]   likely to have tests. You know, we were in St. Louis. They said, "Well, don't worry, there's no
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:29.840]   cases in St. Louis." And I have to say... There's been no testing. Thank you, Noah.
[00:20:29.840 --> 00:20:36.400]   That you know of. Atlantic article that went through the details available from the CDC, of which
[00:20:36.400 --> 00:20:41.360]   there are very few, and then it went to all the different states and how they're reporting
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:46.880]   coronavirus tests, how many tests are available, and what they're saying to the public. And essentially,
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:52.800]   the conclusion was no one is really testing enough. A lot of states are not reporting how many tests
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:58.400]   they're even doing or how many people they are turning away. And we have a massive public health
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:03.680]   crisis that is being kind of swept into the rug. Thousands, only thousands of tests have been
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:10.880]   administered. And out of the... You know, who knows what the potential is in the United States. And,
[00:21:10.880 --> 00:21:15.760]   and of course, if you aren't testing, then you don't know who... Not only who has it, but how it's
[00:21:15.760 --> 00:21:22.720]   spreading. Right. Yeah. Did you see how Seattle was testing for this? They were unable to secure
[00:21:22.720 --> 00:21:28.480]   tests from the CDC. So they went and they got some of the publicly available data, and they
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:33.520]   isolated their population by saying, "Okay, you have every single flu-like symptom,
[00:21:33.520 --> 00:21:37.520]   and we're going to give you the flu test, and you're not showing up positive for the flu."
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:44.000]   So Seattle was actually forced to develop their own test for this because of a lack of leadership
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:50.320]   by the CDC. And I think that's really scary that because of this lack of testing kits, a lot of,
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:55.040]   you know, a lot of states are kind of on their own looking for solutions like that.
[00:21:55.840 --> 00:22:02.400]   The other side effect is I'm really sick of singing Happy Birthday. So supposedly you're
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:06.960]   supposed to sing Happy Birthday twice while you wash your hands. But Carston has provided us
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:12.000]   with an alternative. This is the poster from the National Institutes of Health on How to
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:18.800]   Wash Your Hands, combined with Dunes, Litany of Fear. I must not fear. If, by the way, this takes
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:24.320]   exactly the right amount of time. Fear is the modern killer. Fear is the little death that brings
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:29.600]   total obliteration. By that time you're doing the backs of your hands, I will face my fear.
[00:22:29.600 --> 00:22:35.760]   Now scrub your nails too. I will permit it to pass over me, scrub your thumbs and threw me.
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:41.760]   And then when it has gone past, I will turn to the inner eye to see its path that's under the water,
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:47.360]   where the fear has gone dry with a single-use paper towel, dry, and then use the paper towel
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:52.400]   to turn off the faucet. There will be nothing, and then your hands, only eye, will remain. That's
[00:22:52.400 --> 00:22:59.120]   credit to Reddit, by the way. I love that. I'm putting that in my COVID-19 pages in my notebook.
[00:22:59.120 --> 00:23:03.360]   It's got to be a 12th step that is used in other single-use paper towels open the door.
[00:23:03.360 --> 00:23:06.080]   To open the door, they left out the door. How are you getting?
[00:23:06.080 --> 00:23:10.240]   It's a very integral part. Every single time I go to reach the door, I'm like, God damn it.
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:16.880]   I'm going to ruin my clean hands. For years, I've read and kind of laughed at a well-designed
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:21.200]   bathroom. We'll have a paper towel near the door, along with a receptacle to throw it so that you
[00:23:21.200 --> 00:23:27.520]   can use it to open the door. They never do, so I now carry a handkerchief, which I should probably
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:31.600]   sterilize, because I've opened all the bathroom doors. Yeah, how do you know that you're grabbing
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:36.000]   it in the part that has touched the door, or whether it's the clean part? Maybe you're just
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.800]   infecting yourself again and again. I'll be infecting over and over again. Well, I shouldn't do this.
[00:23:40.800 --> 00:23:47.440]   Oh, that was a bad idea. Oh, wow. Have you been able to stop touching your face, Seth? I've
[00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:53.280]   literally touched my face probably five times. Seth can't wear an N95 mask, so you're out of luck.
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:24:02.320]   You got no seal around that beard, no seal. Yeah, glasses are pretty much full of bonavirus.
[00:24:02.320 --> 00:24:06.560]   I mean, they're touching my face. Touching my hands. I don't know.
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:14.400]   I don't even think of that. I was talking about our phones more. The phone is pretty much one of
[00:24:14.400 --> 00:24:19.600]   the most disgusting objects that you have. People, you can't exactly put it under the sink and wash
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:23.600]   it, even though the new iPhones are reasonably water resistant. I've been reading on Reddit.
[00:24:23.600 --> 00:24:29.600]   People are actually doing that. Really? I can't really recommend it. I bought a device. It's
[00:24:29.600 --> 00:24:36.000]   basically it's an infrared lamp, and you put your phone in there. You've got it for it. Yes,
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:37.520]   you've got it. You've got it. You've got it. You've got it. You've got it. You've got it. You've got it.
[00:24:37.520 --> 00:24:41.680]   Infrared will cook it, which would kill the germs, but may also keep it on the phone.
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:48.560]   That would be a good idea anyway. Yes, it does that. We'll also break down the DNA,
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:52.880]   so it works on viruses and bacterias. Yes, see, this is another company that's going to do very
[00:24:52.880 --> 00:24:59.520]   well. PhoneSoap at phonesope.com is a little case with a UV light in it. Look at the top.
[00:24:59.520 --> 00:25:03.600]   Due to increased demand, the option to pre-order will be available for some products that are out
[00:25:03.600 --> 00:25:10.640]   of stock. Order today to keep your place in line. Basically, they're completely out of stock on all
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:15.120]   of these. I wonder whether they're manufacturing all of this. Oh, yeah. In China.
[00:25:15.120 --> 00:25:22.640]   Ships May 18th. Ships May 30th. Ships April 15th. Ships May 18th. Ships April 30th. You're going
[00:25:22.640 --> 00:25:32.720]   to be dead by then, folks. We'll be at the end of contagion by then. It's too late. Oh, boy. Yeah,
[00:25:32.720 --> 00:25:38.880]   that's amazing. Yeah, so I've been actually just using a wipe, but they do say that the coronavirus
[00:25:39.600 --> 00:25:45.440]   will last nine days on the glass surface of your phone. So whatever you do, do not.
[00:25:45.440 --> 00:25:50.960]   Let's see. Do not take a call by putting your phone to your face. No calls 2020.
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:59.840]   This is depressing. It's so depressing. And I feel like we're kind of whistling past the graveyard
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:06.480]   as we joke about this. Yeah. By the way, Steve Wozniak is not dead.
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:12.000]   Oh, yeah. No, that tweet, Reese. This was kind of an irresponsible.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.240]   Just tweeting. We mean, Janet may have been patient zero.
[00:26:16.240 --> 00:26:24.640]   Out even getting any testing, just a casual tweet with a swarm app link. Yeah, that's how Steve
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:28.880]   tweets these days. By the way, Steve has been at the West Coast Sports Institute for the last seven
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:36.880]   days. He says, checking out. This was on Monday. Janet's bad cough started January 4th. We had
[00:26:36.880 --> 00:26:43.760]   just returned from China. And may both have been patient zero in the US. Later, he reported,
[00:26:43.760 --> 00:26:50.080]   Jenna had a sinus infection and not coronavirus, but he did say he'd go. They went get this straight
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:56.800]   after this visit to China. They went to Vegas, where he was scheduled for many talks and so forth.
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:02.480]   And he felt so bad. He went to his room for four days. You may have just had the regular flu.
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:09.280]   There weren't any tests at the time. So, and you know, it's this is Woz's sense of humor. He's joking.
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:15.280]   I saw that and he had a cable news segment. I don't know which station it was on. It was,
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:20.720]   you know, the YouTube algorithm will play it for you. It was not a good segment. I love the Woz,
[00:27:20.720 --> 00:27:26.000]   but I think I think he's a better tech commentator maybe than a health.
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:29.840]   She's not even a very good tech commentator. I was trying to be nice.
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:35.280]   I love, no, and I know Steve. I love him. I've hung out with him. I've been on a cruise ship with
[00:27:35.280 --> 00:27:43.840]   him, not locked in for 20 days, but maybe your patient's doing. Yeah. Oh my god. So, look,
[00:27:43.840 --> 00:27:49.680]   there's nothing to panic over. Do not go buy all the toilet paper you can find.
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:55.840]   Although people have been doing this morning and there was like two rolls left. It's crazy.
[00:27:55.840 --> 00:27:59.920]   Oh my gosh. No, instead, but do what we did buy an eight thousand dollar Japanese toilet.
[00:27:59.920 --> 00:28:05.440]   You don't need toilet paper. Did you just cough, Lisa? Stay over there.
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:05.520]   Oh.
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:12.000]   You can hear a cackling and lightly in a background.
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:19.440]   Is it a dry cough? How's your temperature? I think most people who get it will probably not die.
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:29.680]   Like 98% of you. So, of course, unfortunately, the Trump administration decided to modify the
[00:28:29.680 --> 00:28:36.720]   CDC's recommendations. CDC said, don't fly if you're over 60 or you have an underlying condition.
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:41.040]   The Trump administration thought, well, that's a little extreme. You can fly.
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:46.800]   Don't know what they said. Just don't go on a cruise ship, I think is what they said.
[00:28:49.360 --> 00:28:52.640]   Yeah, because then you'll just be stuck in the cruise ship. That's really
[00:28:52.640 --> 00:28:58.320]   Trump announces that he doesn't want to let you off the ship because it would increase the numbers
[00:28:58.320 --> 00:29:02.560]   and the last about a few. I mean, we can say that and laugh about it, but it's also just
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:08.960]   incredibly dark and incredibly concerning because it's like there are so many people stuck on board
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:17.360]   unable to receive quality medical care. It has been also bad for civil liberties.
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:22.400]   China and actually I bet you the US is considering this. China has been using
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:27.840]   the Alibaba app to tell you if you've been exposed to anybody with coronavirus because,
[00:29:27.840 --> 00:29:32.080]   guess what? It turns out your phone knows where you've been and knows where everyone else has
[00:29:32.080 --> 00:29:36.400]   been so you can just scan yourself your face and they'll say, oh, yeah, you were on the train
[00:29:36.400 --> 00:29:43.680]   with that guy last Thursday. Clear view AI is ears just perked up. I honestly think,
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:49.600]   you know, because the civil liberties are most at risk when people are afraid, right? We know.
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:56.800]   People are willing to trade their security or their privacy for safety.
[00:29:56.800 --> 00:30:02.160]   And I wouldn't be surprised if people started proposing Congress, started proposing some kind of
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:11.520]   surveillance system to protect us from coronavirus, right? I would not pass a policy like that.
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:14.720]   That's very Orwellian. That's terrifying. And you're right. I mean, we,
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:19.680]   those of us are old enough, we lived through the Bush years and we saw what happened when people
[00:30:19.680 --> 00:30:24.560]   were afraid in the aftermath of 9/11. Patriot Act is still the law of the land, folks. Up for
[00:30:24.560 --> 00:30:29.760]   renewal right now. Yeah, it's true. Both parties passed that. Yeah, of course.
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:33.760]   I wrote it up in Hoppeau like blasting. I remember that. Yeah. Absolutely indefensible.
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:39.840]   But yeah, I think you're really right on. I'm curious and I say this genuinely not knowing how
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:47.840]   I feel about this because I'm being an engineer, I tend to lean on experts and see how they feel
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:53.680]   about this. But when I see China shutting down Wuhan and Italy just announced the one of their
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:57.840]   cities, the society of New York, they're basically doing the same thing. Right. Right.
[00:30:57.840 --> 00:31:04.960]   Right. How do you all feel about that? I'm very torn about it. It just seems to me that that
[00:31:04.960 --> 00:31:12.160]   might be an example where limiting travel might be a valid course of action. How does everyone else feel?
[00:31:12.160 --> 00:31:19.760]   So I was having this debate with a doctor friend of mine and he seems to believe that
[00:31:19.760 --> 00:31:25.120]   we're just going to, like America's a little different than China and we're just going to take
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:31.600]   it. Like we're going to hide our elderly and sick and keep them isolated. But everybody else is
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:35.440]   going to be like, you know, I'm going to get it. I don't notice people staying home.
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:45.120]   I do. I do. My gym is a ghost town. The political rallies. Yeah, the political rallies I've been
[00:31:45.120 --> 00:31:50.160]   doing. They've been very well attended, but everywhere else. Absolutely. I see it.
[00:31:50.160 --> 00:31:56.080]   That's a good example. Peloton is probably doing fantastically right now because nobody
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:59.920]   wants to go to the gym and do the soul cycle or whatever. Right. They're all just getting
[00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:05.120]   peloton at their house. Well, maybe we'll have a system like this. This is the Alipay app.
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:11.600]   You scan your face and if you're green, it's good. You can travel freely. If you're red, stay home.
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:17.600]   It also means the issue with this is that a lot of people are saying they're getting
[00:32:17.600 --> 00:32:23.360]   red or yellow or things saying that they should have restricted travel due to their
[00:32:23.360 --> 00:32:27.040]   exposure to coronavirus. And if they're saying I haven't been exposed to anything,
[00:32:27.040 --> 00:32:34.080]   I don't have a temperature. I haven't done anything but yet they are stuck unable to move or
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:40.320]   live their lives. It's a little weird that Ali pay. They're calling this the Alipay health code
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:48.160]   that Alipay is determining whether you're healthy enough to travel. Yeah, that's really weird.
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:52.320]   It's not great. Payment app. That is freaky.
[00:32:54.160 --> 00:33:02.160]   People sign up through this is Aunt Financial, a sister company of Alibaba. People sign up with
[00:33:02.160 --> 00:33:06.480]   the Wallet app Alipay and are assigned a color code. Green, yellow or red that indicates their
[00:33:06.480 --> 00:33:14.080]   health status. It's being used in 200 cities and is being rolled out nationwide. But neither
[00:33:14.080 --> 00:33:17.520]   the company, no Chinese officials according to the New York Times have explained how it
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:24.000]   classifies people. It's not clear why you get that color code. At the same time,
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.520]   people get scared enough. I could see them doing it. You know, I think you're right, Seth. I think
[00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:31.280]   in the United States, we'll just take the hit. I feel like that's what I'm saying.
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:37.440]   Take the hit means the death of how many people? Yeah, millions, hundreds of thousands.
[00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:45.120]   I feel pretty good. I'm in the high risk group. I'm over 60 type two diabetic high blood pressure.
[00:33:45.120 --> 00:33:53.920]   I'm in the risk group. But you would self isolate yourself theoretically
[00:33:53.920 --> 00:33:59.280]   if you thought you were compromised due to some preexisting health condition.
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:07.200]   And they have a job where they're expected to be there in person. And then they have to choose
[00:34:07.200 --> 00:34:14.240]   between whether do I stay at home with coronavirus, this disease that might kill me or go to a doctor
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:21.520]   where I'm going to get an untold amount of medical debt from whatever treatment they're going to
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:29.440]   have to give and lose my income while I'm doing it. I mean, it seems problematic to have people who
[00:34:29.440 --> 00:34:35.200]   are healthy and able to do privilege in the sense deciding making those sort of decisions for people
[00:34:35.200 --> 00:34:40.160]   who are in between a rock and a hard place either way. A couple of weeks ago, Zanep Tofiki,
[00:34:40.160 --> 00:34:48.640]   we love her. She's a sociologist and a geek wrote a blog post on Scientific American in which
[00:34:48.640 --> 00:34:54.640]   I thought it was really good. She said it's not just smart to prepare for this for coronavirus.
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:35:01.680]   It's our civic duty because if we don't take care of ourselves, then we could jam the hospitals
[00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:08.240]   and people, our neighbors, our elderly neighbors could be deprived of the kind of health care that
[00:35:08.240 --> 00:35:13.760]   they absolutely need. And not even the elderly neighbors. Let's say we get to a situation where
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:20.560]   we haven't as Tofiki greatly says like flatten the curve, where things get as bad as they can as
[00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:25.200]   quickly as they can in the hospitals or overrun with, I'm going to compromise an elderly patients
[00:35:25.200 --> 00:35:31.200]   who have caught this, then any of us normal people who have regular diseases or health issues would
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:36.000]   get turned away because there is not, let's say someone goes into labor because they have a baby
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:39.920]   on the way. How are they supposed to access medical care if all the hospital beds are filled up
[00:35:39.920 --> 00:35:44.480]   with coronavirus patients? So on and so forth, it's compounding levels of all.
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:53.600]   Only 100 ventilators in the United States. Oh, oh my God. There's certainly not hospital beds or
[00:35:53.600 --> 00:35:59.840]   this is why we get vaccinated, right? Yeah, but we can't. But we cannot be after a whole year.
[00:35:59.840 --> 00:36:03.520]   Yeah, but that's self isolation, I guess. Yeah.
[00:36:04.560 --> 00:36:09.680]   Well, also what if it mutates? I mean, that's the real worry. Like you've got the common cold,
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:14.560]   like the reason it's very difficult to prepare a flu shot every single year,
[00:36:14.560 --> 00:36:18.000]   because there are so many different strains of it is constantly mutating. What's going to happen
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:26.720]   to this? From here, we just don't know. And again, this is really the worst time this could possibly
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:32.560]   be happening because we're just so unprepared on every single level, on a healthcare infrastructure
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:39.600]   level, on a leadership level. Paris, I love your statement about medical debt. There was a New
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:44.560]   York Times writer, I haven't been able to cooperate this, but a New York Times writer was retweeting
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:51.200]   some information from the CDC saying eventually the coronavirus test itself is going to be covered
[00:36:51.200 --> 00:36:56.000]   by as far as extensive hospitalization. If you're on Medicaid, it will not be covered.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:02.080]   And that is a terrifying thought. Like what happens when many of us are going into hundreds
[00:37:02.080 --> 00:37:08.720]   of thousands of dollars of debt over this? Let's say you took an Uber pool and it turns out a couple
[00:37:08.720 --> 00:37:13.920]   of weeks later, they determined that the other person who's in the Uber pool with you has coronavirus
[00:37:13.920 --> 00:37:19.120]   or was affected by it. So then you are put in quarantine and you either have just average
[00:37:19.120 --> 00:37:23.600]   insurance or no insurance. And then you suddenly have to pay how many thousands of dollars in
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:28.080]   medical debt for being put in quarantine for 14 days, regardless of whether or not you actually
[00:37:28.080 --> 00:37:35.120]   end up with coronavirus. Or you don't get sick days, so you don't get to work for two weeks and
[00:37:35.120 --> 00:37:40.880]   you don't get a paycheck. I mean, the consequences are significant. Yeah, absolutely. So I don't want
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:48.800]   to depress people, but it's serious. It is serious. And it's serious in a way that may not be immediately
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:53.040]   obvious. That's why I thought Tofekki's article was really interesting, flattened the curve,
[00:37:53.040 --> 00:38:00.400]   because it's not for you, it's for everybody. Well, I guess all that soil I've got in my house,
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:04.480]   I guess that's a good thing now. I was doing my civic duty and flattening the curve.
[00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:10.160]   You don't drink that, do you? I do, absolutely. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do. I do.
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:15.440]   I do. I'm a soil and bro. It's really. I have a couple of cases in my garage. I'll send them
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:21.600]   along. They're expired. Yeah, that's probably not great. I feel like soil doesn't go bad though.
[00:38:22.240 --> 00:38:25.360]   It can. It gets better. They moved over to algae protein. It's
[00:38:25.360 --> 00:38:30.480]   for many that last for three years. Yeah, see, it's from. Oh, no, I have the original, I think.
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:36.720]   Okay. The one that, yeah, the powder one. The one you do uses a laxative if times get tough.
[00:38:36.720 --> 00:38:41.680]   No, I seriously have a ton of soil that I've been trying to. What should I do with this?
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:47.280]   Should I mean, if it's expired, it's probably. I guess I have to throw it out, huh? On the other
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:54.240]   hand, if I get quarantined, maybe I'll be glad I have it. Yeah, it's true. I drank some expired
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:39:00.000]   soilent just to see what would happen a couple of months ago. How'd it go? What's all right?
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:06.960]   Are you patient zero now? What's all right? It doesn't get worse. It doesn't get worse. That's
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:13.440]   exactly right. It does not get worse. I don't know. Sometimes I have like a soil
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:17.760]   entreling. I left it open for a little bit and shook back up, tried to drink it being like,
[00:39:17.760 --> 00:39:21.680]   okay, it's been a day or two. It can't be worse. And it's chunky, which is bad. Oh, you don't want
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:28.080]   chunky, soil it. You don't want chunky. I love the coiling. Very good, but chunky. Nope.
[00:39:28.080 --> 00:39:32.640]   So you, my, I liked the flavor too. And everybody thought I was nutty. It's got a soy flavor.
[00:39:32.640 --> 00:39:36.800]   It's fine. It's got a soy flavor. I love the taste of soy milk. I'm lactose intolerant,
[00:39:36.800 --> 00:39:42.560]   so I normally drink soy or oatmeal. Do you do? Do they still make the half coffee, half soil?
[00:39:43.040 --> 00:39:46.960]   Caught the best ones. Yeah. I think there's a new name for it. Really big fan of that.
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:49.920]   Like the vocal one. They recently released a mint chocolate.
[00:39:49.920 --> 00:39:55.280]   You're going to be a silent. There's one of my, you don't refrigerate it, right? I'm just checking.
[00:39:55.280 --> 00:40:01.600]   I'm a fridge. I think it tastes better when it's cold. It's better cold. Yeah. I like the,
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:07.920]   I like the, I like the, it's, it's, it's tasteful. Silty. It's more silty if it's like room
[00:40:07.920 --> 00:40:12.880]   temperature. It is a little silty. There's something, there's sand in it. Yeah. What, what were you
[00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:18.160]   saying, Brianna? Sorry. I was just going to say they came out with a square meal bar version of it.
[00:40:18.160 --> 00:40:23.760]   Yeah. I wish they'd make a bigger one that was 400 calories, but they, it's in little 100 calories.
[00:40:23.760 --> 00:40:28.800]   It's perfect for running for Congress. It is. I really mean this. I leave it in my purse and I
[00:40:28.800 --> 00:40:33.440]   leave first thing in the morning and I'm eating while I'm driving to my first event. It's, it's,
[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:38.800]   it's fantastic. It's in the right hand cupboard, John, in the back. It was, it's my, you know,
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:42.880]   I have a bunch of my office whenever I am, you know, my emergency. Soil it exactly.
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:47.760]   Yeah. It's like, okay, if you're having a long day, you realize you can't eat lunch.
[00:40:47.760 --> 00:40:55.200]   Shuck one. We should be next. I should probably explain that Soil it was designed by some
[00:40:55.200 --> 00:41:00.800]   Silicon Valley nerve. Rose the last, I believe, is because, you know, I've always said there should
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:07.520]   be people chow. If you can make chow for dogs and zoo animals that has a complete meal,
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:12.480]   you should have a complete meal for humans. And this is basically human chow.
[00:41:12.480 --> 00:41:22.400]   It is neutral liquid that is not like unpalatable in any way. It doesn't have any harsh flavors or
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:27.840]   things that would make you actively dislike it. And it has all of the nutrients ostensibly
[00:41:27.840 --> 00:41:31.760]   and caloric requirements that you need for one fourth of your daily, I don't know,
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:37.440]   caloric whatever. You want to live on it exclusively, would you? I did it once for a week in college,
[00:41:37.440 --> 00:41:41.120]   as kind of a stunt for our college newspaper. And honestly, it was good. It was good week.
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:47.120]   Okay, this expires January. This expired in January 2017.
[00:41:47.120 --> 00:41:52.960]   Oh, no, please don't do it. You have too much to live for. Don't do it. At least shake it for
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:42:01.680]   me. I've been saved by the producer. Let's take a break.
[00:42:01.680 --> 00:42:12.480]   Thank you, Carson. Carson just ran over a snatch.
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:17.920]   Coming up on aisle seven, I think he's been an accident. Carson is America's greatest hero.
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:26.640]   Don't you drink it. Don't you drink it. I'm not going to drink it. I think it's fine.
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:35.840]   I think it's not fine. It says it's best buy. It doesn't say it's bad buy. It's best buy.
[00:42:35.840 --> 00:42:42.480]   I'm just past is bad. Do it. I'm kind of crazy.
[00:42:42.480 --> 00:42:46.000]   I know. I'll be at you can read the soil and then I'll give it back to you.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:49.040]   Or then you can drink the soil. I have beaten my body up. I was drinking
[00:42:49.040 --> 00:42:54.160]   soil. Then I went keto. So I have all this old soil. And now I'm not keto anymore. So I figure
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:59.840]   I can have the soil. Do the add or show today brought to you by oddly enough, a life insurance
[00:42:59.840 --> 00:43:06.320]   agency. You may want to know about this. Wouldn't you love to be able to save
[00:43:06.320 --> 00:43:15.920]   on your life insurance as much as 41%? It's health IQ. You could get a million dollars worth
[00:43:15.920 --> 00:43:22.800]   of life insurance from as little as $36 a month. Health IQ uses science and data to secure lower
[00:43:22.800 --> 00:43:30.800]   life insurance rates for healthy people like you. So if you know health, you exercise,

[00:43:36.640 --> 00:43:41.840]   then you really can get a better insurance rate. But you can't just do it yourself. You can't
[00:43:41.840 --> 00:43:46.080]   just go to the insurance company because they're not going to look at you funny. To them, you're
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:51.680]   just a number. What you do is you go to health IQ. They're your insurance concierge. You're more

[00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:19.520]   coronavirus related apps in the app store unless they come from legit health organizations.
[00:45:19.520 --> 00:45:25.680]   The problem is of course, humans being humans, they're jumping on this and there's people putting
[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:33.200]   out apps and Apple does not want to put bad information out. And I think that's a probably
[00:45:33.200 --> 00:45:36.800]   good thing. I don't know if Google's doing the same thing with the play store. I haven't heard that.
[00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:44.880]   Always in cases of announcements like this. My first question is how are how are they going to
[00:45:44.880 --> 00:45:49.520]   happen? How are they how are they policing apps? Well, God knows they must have a million people
[00:45:49.520 --> 00:45:56.160]   reviewing apps, right? I mean, Apple's that's got to be a big part of their job. They review all
[00:45:56.160 --> 00:46:02.640]   apps anyway, right? I mean, it's been mostly automated over the last few years. No, no, no,
[00:46:02.640 --> 00:46:06.800]   no, no, no. Is it? I think it's more than it was. Don't think you're a human.
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:12.000]   To review those apps. Oh, they absolutely do. Yeah. There's a human that that hits every app,
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:16.960]   but I think a lot of vetting is done by logarithms. So they probably have programs they run and
[00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:22.160]   stuff because a lot of add a lot of apps that are clearly against Apple's right of service have
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:26.880]   gotten through. And I think in this, I mean, just generally in the history of the Apple's app store,
[00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:30.720]   there are cases where they even like, Oh, this is an app. It's against our terms of service.
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:35.280]   We're taking it down. And I think that if somebody really wants it to, you could make an app called
[00:46:35.840 --> 00:46:40.800]   some random word and it could actually be full of coronavirus misinformation, but such is
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:47.840]   the way of internet content and moderation. Right. I mean, this is, I agree, it's probably a good,
[00:46:47.840 --> 00:46:52.960]   it's probably a good policy overall. This is extraordinary circumstance, but it obviously
[00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:58.720]   makes me nervous to have a private company kind of censoring what kind of health information you
[00:46:58.720 --> 00:47:02.880]   can come out with. That said, this is a case where it's probably a good policy.
[00:47:03.440 --> 00:47:09.920]   Oh, yeah. I mean, look at Tito's vodka actually had to tweet. You cannot use Tito's vodka to sterilize
[00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:20.560]   your hands. It's only 40 proof. Oh, God, we're all idiots. We're all so in so, so much trouble.
[00:47:20.560 --> 00:47:23.120]   Dude, I made my own hand sanitizer, man.
[00:47:23.120 --> 00:47:30.240]   Did you all say the story about all the students in Wuhan, China? I love this. I love this so much.
[00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:36.240]   This is so great. I do see have all the students in Wuhan, China, and they moved over to an app to
[00:47:36.240 --> 00:47:41.840]   assign all the students homework while they're being homeschooled. And they figured out if they
[00:47:41.840 --> 00:47:47.280]   could get the reviews of the app down to one star, it will be delisted from the star. So they
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:54.080]   review bonded to get down from like four stars to one star. And I just, I admire that. Yes.
[00:47:55.200 --> 00:48:04.160]   The power. Wow. Uber and Lyft say they're going to continue to pay quarantined drivers. I mean,
[00:48:04.160 --> 00:48:09.600]   this is a problem. If you're a gig worker, what do you do if you get quarantined? You're out.
[00:48:09.600 --> 00:48:15.440]   Especially because in our area here in the New York City area, there was just a coronavirus
[00:48:15.440 --> 00:48:24.320]   patient who is an Uber driver. Hey, hey. I literally took an Uber yesterday to this
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:29.360]   glass blowing workshop. I was in as I was getting out. I was like, stay safe and stay sanitized.
[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:35.120]   And I was like, Oh God, this is the world we're in now. I mean, it's got to be a very scary reality
[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:39.760]   for them because they don't know who they're having to share like just a small amount of air.
[00:48:39.760 --> 00:48:45.840]   You are very crafty Paris Martin. No, you blow glass, you spin pots. You do so.
[00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:48.000]   I just made a really cool neon sign. That's what I was doing.
[00:48:48.000 --> 00:48:54.080]   What? Yeah. Is anything we're seeing like those those legs? Are those yours? Is that
[00:48:54.080 --> 00:48:59.600]   yes. So I got these legs a couple of years ago. They were mannequin legs that I happened to see on
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:04.000]   Craigslist one day and somebody was giving them away for free. So on my lunch break,
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.720]   I went and got them and then I took them home and spray painted them gold.
[00:49:06.720 --> 00:49:12.160]   Why didn't anybody get a picture of Paris Martin walking down the street in Brooklyn,
[00:49:12.160 --> 00:49:17.680]   carrying a pair of legs? That's. Oh, I there are people definitely did. I have never been
[00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:22.400]   south more in the street than when I was carrying those home from work. They say you're in fear
[00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:26.400]   where people stop me, somebody in the subway because I had to take them in the subway to get them home.
[00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:32.560]   One person came up and they screamed to be like, oh my god, where did the top half go?
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:35.440]   So and ran away. Giving line.
[00:49:35.440 --> 00:49:39.280]   People said nice legs. Of course, that's what I would have said.
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:43.280]   They giving line to the fact that you are anonymous in New York. I thought you thought you could
[00:49:43.280 --> 00:49:47.760]   get away with anything. Nobody pay attention to you doing anything but apparently carrying legs is it?
[00:49:47.760 --> 00:49:52.080]   Yeah, I know. Normally people don't give them. Don't give anything at all if you're
[00:49:52.080 --> 00:49:55.040]   but legs. Everybody wanted to talk to me. It was very funny.
[00:49:55.040 --> 00:50:03.280]   Apple. This is from Philip Elmer Dewitt, P-E-D-30.com.
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:14.640]   Says, you probably should come to work. Yeah. This is who has to come to the office. The most
[00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:23.600]   people working from home is Microsoft 87 percent. Then Amazon 78 percent, 68 percent of Facebook
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:31.360]   employees, 44 percent of Google employees. The least was 38 percent Apple employees.
[00:50:31.360 --> 00:50:36.800]   Yeah, I've heard that from Apple people for a long time. This is probably an unpopular opinion
[00:50:36.800 --> 00:50:43.280]   but I think for software engineering, there is a lot of value in being able to sit in the same
[00:50:43.280 --> 00:50:49.280]   space with other people you're developing software with to draw on a whiteboard, figure out solutions.
[00:50:49.280 --> 00:50:56.240]   I think it's one of these weird professions where it's not easy to do remote work necessarily.
[00:50:56.240 --> 00:51:02.080]   At least it's not for me and the people I've worked with. I can understand that policy
[00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:07.760]   and Apple's been famously aggressive towards it from, gosh, I remember hearing friends talking
[00:51:07.760 --> 00:51:16.640]   about back in 2007. Apparently, Apple might be changing their tune because you're very own
[00:51:16.640 --> 00:51:23.200]   discovery, Seth Mark Gurman. Today. Yes, today tweeted. Apple's encouraging employees to work
[00:51:23.200 --> 00:51:28.320]   from home if they can add, if they can, as an additional precaution. But the retail stores
[00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:32.160]   remain open. Somebody's going to work. Somebody has to work.
[00:51:35.920 --> 00:51:42.560]   It's hard to know. I mentioned at the beginning, our studios are closed for the duration
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:49.760]   to visitors. That wasn't because of me. Maybe I'm foolish but I'm the guy drinking expired
[00:51:49.760 --> 00:51:58.000]   soilents. But I didn't bother me. I figure we won't shake hands but it's not going to.
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:52:02.480]   But a number of my employees said, I'm asthmatic or I have issues. I don't think it's a good idea.
[00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:08.000]   I think as an employer, you really have to take that seriously. I don't want to risk
[00:52:08.000 --> 00:52:14.080]   help my employees. What I'm willing to do myself does not necessarily extend to as an employer what
[00:52:14.080 --> 00:52:21.680]   I would do. I'm wondering how this is going to impact other live TV shows that rely on live studio
[00:52:21.680 --> 00:52:26.320]   audiences. Is that going to continue being a thing here in New York? Didn't the NBA talk about
[00:52:26.320 --> 00:52:33.920]   playing its games without fans? LeBron said, I'm not playing without fans.
[00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:37.280]   March Madness, they're thinking about it too. The college tournament.
[00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:44.800]   Every fan can just get a hamster ball. A bunch of people in hamster balls rolling around.
[00:52:44.800 --> 00:52:51.840]   I think some of this is that we've watched too many zombie apocalypse movies and TV shows.
[00:52:52.720 --> 00:52:57.280]   We're projecting onto this zombie apocalypse. I think that it is exactly what we were talking
[00:52:57.280 --> 00:53:01.120]   about earlier. All these sorts of things, they have to minimize risk to flatten the curve.
[00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:05.440]   It's hard to know, though. Is this necessary or is this over?
[00:53:05.440 --> 00:53:12.960]   At CPAC, there was at least one confirmed or rumored coronavirus case from that mass gathering
[00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:18.400]   of people. Why wouldn't you? It's just a little ironic because at CPAC, the consensus was this
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:23.520]   is all being hyped up by the media. They're trying to get the president.
[00:53:23.520 --> 00:53:29.760]   It's the media. It's fake news. It would be ironic, wouldn't it, if some of them fell ill?
[00:53:29.760 --> 00:53:33.360]   I wouldn't wish to think about it. Pandemics don't care about what political parks are.
[00:53:33.360 --> 00:53:41.360]   Yeah, my husband works in biotech. This is his field. I'm trying to think about how to put this
[00:53:41.360 --> 00:53:47.920]   and not sound partisan. I've been frustrated with some of the accuracy coming out from the
[00:53:47.920 --> 00:53:52.560]   White House about how long it's going to take to develop a vaccine about this.
[00:53:52.560 --> 00:53:57.360]   Watching the president say, "Oh, we're going to have one in six months in a documentary."
[00:53:57.360 --> 00:54:02.640]   No, it's at least a year, a year and a half, Mr. Speaker.
[00:54:02.640 --> 00:54:07.760]   It's a year. Every thing goes absolutely perfect in the vaccine development process,
[00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:12.960]   which has never really happened before. Honestly, I don't... I know this is weird,
[00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:19.120]   but I don't hold it that much against Trump because you get the feeling he just says whatever he thinks.
[00:54:19.120 --> 00:54:26.400]   It's not like he's lying. I don't think he's actually lying. I think he's saying, "No, it could be six
[00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:31.760]   months. It could be a month. It could be five days. I don't know." That's kind of what it is.
[00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:35.840]   I don't think he's going... I don't... I don't... He's calculatingly say, "Let me say something."
[00:54:35.840 --> 00:54:40.080]   So the stock market goes up. Maybe he is. I think he is. You do.
[00:54:40.640 --> 00:54:44.320]   I think he's giving him more credit than I do, actually. I don't give him any credit.
[00:54:44.320 --> 00:54:47.680]   I think he's just saying whatever. The first thing that comes to mind.
[00:54:47.680 --> 00:54:55.920]   No, but I was going to say, I think that there's, to your point, Leo, I agree that some of these
[00:54:55.920 --> 00:55:02.320]   steps are very aggressive. But I think we're trying to buy time for health officials to
[00:55:02.320 --> 00:55:09.040]   do things like up the amount of mass we can produce, to up the amount of disinfectant and toilet paper
[00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:14.480]   we can produce to get tests available. To get tests available. So what we're trying to do right now,
[00:55:14.480 --> 00:55:20.960]   it's to slow down the spread of this. And hopefully, according to what my husband has told me,
[00:55:20.960 --> 00:55:25.840]   who works in this field, if things go well, I think it's reasonable to hope we could start
[00:55:25.840 --> 00:55:32.480]   seeing a vaccine two years from now. So if we can slow it down enough for us to get prepared,
[00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:38.560]   that is a reasonable course of action. Are we going to be living like this five years from now?
[00:55:38.560 --> 00:55:42.000]   I really hope not. But I think it's reasonable to want to slow this down.
[00:55:42.000 --> 00:55:47.200]   Yeah. And I, by the way, I know people are saying, okay, enough about coronavirus. Let's talk
[00:55:47.200 --> 00:55:52.400]   about the tech industry. There is nothing going on in the tech industry. Oh, yeah. No, it's just
[00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:57.360]   been coronavirus related tech news. Yeah. I mean, I would be glad to talk about it.
[00:55:57.360 --> 00:56:02.320]   And whatnot this week. And they're like, it's all coronavirus. Yeah. Yeah. I mean, I would be
[00:56:02.320 --> 00:56:08.000]   thrilled to talk about the next phone. Although I actually am mad at wired.
[00:56:08.880 --> 00:56:17.840]   Because you published you, you, Paris Martin, you published a review of an insanely expensive
[00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:29.440]   cooking device. And you, the review from Joe Ray, a chef and wired said,
[00:56:31.280 --> 00:56:38.240]   what did the headline was? Something like this insane product you have to have. So I ordered it.
[00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:42.720]   It's the robotic equivalent of your own personal sous chef. I don't think anybody is thinking
[00:56:42.720 --> 00:56:46.800]   their own personal sous, if it's something I have to have. Well, you don't know me.
[00:56:46.800 --> 00:56:54.240]   So I bought it. It's 1500 freaking bucks. But at least I'll be able to cook soup
[00:56:54.240 --> 00:56:59.680]   while we're quarantined. This thing is also. Did you use the affiliate link, Leo?
[00:56:59.680 --> 00:57:05.920]   Got a paper my salary. I use the affiliate link. I did buy now. I am not at all involved with
[00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:13.280]   gear posts, but love to have a job. I'm going to, I'm going to bring it, bring it in on Wednesday
[00:57:13.280 --> 00:57:16.560]   because Stacy Higginbotham on our this week in Google show. You're going to cook your
[00:57:16.560 --> 00:57:23.680]   soil out with them. She yeah, she has the same Jones for expensive internet connected cooking
[00:57:23.680 --> 00:57:30.800]   devices. But I didn't gather from the review and from the picture is this thing is about the size
[00:57:30.800 --> 00:57:35.920]   of R2 D2. Really? Yeah, it's not small. It looks doesn't look like you could fit right on your
[00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:40.960]   camera. I mean, I assume that's why it's 1500. Yeah, it's a big thing. And also it has gets new
[00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:47.280]   recipes all the time and stuff like that. How is it better than just a kind of looks like an
[00:57:47.280 --> 00:57:53.040]   instant pot? Yeah, it can't see. I should have looked at it. How do you? I haven't cooked with it yet.
[00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:57.440]   It's it's so elaborate that I haven't had time to set it up.
[00:57:57.440 --> 00:58:04.640]   It is okay. Anyway, thank you. I'm a sucker. No, no, no. In fact,
[00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:09.600]   I gave up Instagram because I bought every ninth picture was something I bought.
[00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:15.600]   So I had to I literally had to give it up. I think I need a 12 step program.
[00:58:16.160 --> 00:58:20.800]   I get it now that I have a house. My husband, I bought a house this year and I've got an actual
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:27.040]   kitchen to fill up. I bought so many kitchen gadgets. I never would have guessed like the top
[00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:33.120]   of the line insta pot. I've got two food processors. I mean, it's tempting because I don't know. It's
[00:58:33.120 --> 00:58:38.480]   like your your space to do your art. Honestly, my favorite thing that I have in my kitchen is my
[00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:43.680]   espresso machine. Yeah. A couple years ago. Best purchase ever made. Yeah. Is it like five times a
[00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:49.200]   day? Very unhealthy caffeine intake wise, but I love it. Is it? Is it really? I think if you mix
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:56.000]   caffeine with silent, you get the perfect. I used to do that. Yeah, I used to like pour it in to a
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:02.400]   soil and kind of shake it up. Yeah. Yeah. You got your Starbucks via packets at the at the airport.
[00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:07.360]   No, that's instant coffee. Oh, but it's so good if you mix it with soil and because you can get like
[00:59:07.360 --> 00:59:13.120]   neck as strong and get super high on all the caffeine, it's great. I'll tell you made for
[00:59:13.120 --> 00:59:22.640]   campaigning. Running for Congress, via and soil it. That's all you need to know. God bless America.
[00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:36.560]   Here's some more coronavirus news. Baby Yoda toys. Oh, no. Oh, sad baby Yoda.
[00:59:37.280 --> 00:59:41.760]   I love the caption of this article, which is you'll be fine, baby Yoda. You're a fictional
[00:59:41.760 --> 00:59:49.360]   character. You're merchandise though. Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh. ominous. Filing by Hasbro,
[00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:58.800]   maker of the baby Yoda toy, said that they're way behind in some of the most highly anticipated
[00:59:58.800 --> 01:00:03.760]   Mandalorian toys recently teased at the New York toy fair. There's another event that won't be
[01:00:03.760 --> 01:00:12.160]   happening again for a while. My coworkers is really nice. Toy fair or baby. Oh, yeah. Toy fair is
[01:00:12.160 --> 01:00:18.400]   awesome. There were a lot. Apparently Thomas, the train engines coming back. He was had a big
[01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:24.400]   show on it. Toy fair. I didn't realize he got away, but all right. Baby Yoda waffle maker makes
[01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:33.200]   a baby Yoda waffle. Maybe not though, if you can't get it. So anyway, this is the tech news we've
[01:00:33.200 --> 01:00:38.800]   been reduced. This is what we've been reduced to. Yeah. You know, the days when I was wishing I
[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:44.400]   wouldn't have to report on another Samsung phone or long gone, folks. Come on, Samsung, give us
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:53.600]   another phone. I did download Plague Inc. You can't get it in China anymore, but I did download it
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:57.280]   because I wanted to prepare. And you know what the number one movie on iTunes this week was?
[01:00:57.280 --> 01:01:03.360]   Number one movie. Contage and I bet. Yeah. I don't know. It's a good movie though. Yeah.
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:09.120]   Well, it's scientifically accurate. It's a less full movie. Yeah. It came out. It came out nine years
[01:01:09.120 --> 01:01:16.720]   ago, but it is for some reason. I don't know why. Number one on iTunes now. Everybody has to watch
[01:01:16.720 --> 01:01:25.120]   Kate Winslet get sick and die. I'm sorry. Gwyneth Paltrow. Well, Kate too. Is that a spoiler?
[01:01:26.240 --> 01:01:32.000]   I think if the movie is that old, you're not to worry about spoilers. I'm a big believer in the
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:37.440]   one year rule. You know, it's good in it. And it is a little prescient. Because remember, this is
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:47.360]   2011. Jude law plays a blogger who has a fallacious cure for the disease featured in contagion,
[01:01:47.360 --> 01:01:55.360]   which is a flu. And he he my favorite scenes in the movie are him walking around in a in a homemade
[01:01:55.920 --> 01:02:04.480]   space. Putting flight. Bloggers were at it. Yeah, it's very blogger. If they may, if they remake,
[01:02:04.480 --> 01:02:12.160]   it'll be a podcaster. We're the new we're the bloggers, the new bloggers. You know, I literally,
[01:02:12.160 --> 01:02:16.400]   I don't know what I'm going to do because I don't you don't have anything else. There's a lot of
[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:22.240]   game news this week. Oh, thank God. Yeah, because they only play games. No, I bet you. There are a lot
[01:02:22.240 --> 01:02:26.080]   of great games out right now. Three is coming to June. They haven't announced whether they're
[01:02:26.080 --> 01:02:32.240]   canceling it or not, right? So you've got the final fantasy seven remake demo, which is absolutely
[01:02:32.240 --> 01:02:38.960]   amazing. That game is just looking 10 out of 10. Your grand blue, grand blue fantasy. That just
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:45.200]   came out this week. That is amazing. You know, it's like, it's really good time for games. Like,
[01:02:45.200 --> 01:02:51.680]   this can be one of the best. And hype is an awesome peak March 20th prepare yourself, prepare your
[01:02:51.680 --> 01:02:53.920]   family. I'm very delighted. Yeah. Absolutely.
[01:02:53.920 --> 01:03:00.880]   Mesa just came out. Oh, that I want to do. That's the, that's the remake, not remake, but
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:06.720]   cleaned up version of Half-Life. Well, oh, really? In, in, in, in the source engine,
[01:03:06.720 --> 01:03:13.040]   built by fans. Yeah. So is it the same story or is it a new story? It is the game. It's the game.
[01:03:13.040 --> 01:03:17.840]   They've just cleaned it up. So it's high quality source and in the Half-Life 2 engine.
[01:03:17.840 --> 01:03:22.720]   I really, I really want to play this officially by valve starting right now.
[01:03:22.720 --> 01:03:28.080]   Is it VR as well as a it's not, it's not VR yet. I wouldn't, I wouldn't be surprised if they make
[01:03:28.080 --> 01:03:32.880]   a look how good that looks. And what, you know what Half-Life was one of the great games of all time.
[01:03:32.880 --> 01:03:38.560]   So good. Yeah. So I play Black Mesa. That looks, that'll keep me for at least the first week of
[01:03:38.560 --> 01:03:44.800]   quarantine. I will play that, but looking at that as a game developer, I mean, source engine is
[01:03:44.800 --> 01:03:50.480]   really dated at this point. It really needs an update. I, I, I, I, I see that. I don't see anything
[01:03:50.480 --> 01:03:55.840]   particularly impressive in that trailer from a technical point. Yes, but fans made that.
[01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:57.680]   Right. Okay. Fair enough. Fair enough.
[01:03:57.680 --> 01:04:04.400]   Do they have to remake all the assets or I mean, how did they? What does that mean? They made it.
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:10.160]   They redrew every, every, every texture, every, rebuilt, re-textured. We did everything.
[01:04:10.160 --> 01:04:14.400]   That's a lot of work. I think the new source engine will let you do sub D levels.
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:20.960]   So you could get the old assets on it and just apply another level of subdivision on it and
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:25.680]   re-textured and have it look a lot better. That's what that looked like to me, but I could be wrong.
[01:04:25.680 --> 01:04:28.880]   Well, you're the, you're the developer. So I trust.
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:30.560]   They had and tell us what they did.
[01:04:30.560 --> 01:04:37.520]   You know, you know what else? It's a big time for websites about whether your favorite thing is
[01:04:37.520 --> 01:04:46.320]   canceled yet. I know. There you go. Is it canceled yet.com? Last updated March 6th.
[01:04:46.320 --> 01:04:48.960]   I wonder if something happened to him. They got canceled.
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:54.080]   They got canceled. Is it canceled? Google. Oh, yeah. South by yeah. Microsoft bill. No.
[01:04:54.080 --> 01:04:58.640]   When is Coachella going to be canceled, guys? Well, actually they have a funny line about
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:04.000]   Coachella. Sadly, no. Sadly, no. What is it?
[01:05:04.000 --> 01:05:06.240]   He keeps rolling isn't Chris Matthews.
[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:09.760]   Oh, Chris Matthews. Yeah. Let's see.
[01:05:09.760 --> 01:05:12.880]   Pax West. No, but Chris Matthews. Yes.
[01:05:12.880 --> 01:05:14.240]   Yes. Yes.
[01:05:14.240 --> 01:05:20.240]   I probably should say, by the way, I'm very sorry about Elizabeth Warren, Brianna.
[01:05:20.240 --> 01:05:21.920]   I'm sure that that breaks your heart.
[01:05:21.920 --> 01:05:27.120]   It's been a hard week for a lot of women, especially here in Massachusetts.
[01:05:27.120 --> 01:05:30.800]   Yeah. It broke my heart. I gave her thousands of dollars.
[01:05:31.760 --> 01:05:36.880]   She never sees that money again. I tell you, Leo, if you saw her in person,
[01:05:36.880 --> 01:05:42.640]   I've seen her so many events in person. She has skills of being a retail politician,
[01:05:42.640 --> 01:05:48.640]   I deeply envy and I'll see. The pinky, the selfie lines. I mean, just amazing.
[01:05:48.640 --> 01:05:54.000]   What's really sad to me is that it's going to come down to a vote between
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:06:01.520]   two old men in their 70s, old white men in their 70s. Can't we do better than that?
[01:06:02.160 --> 01:06:05.600]   Yeah. That's just pathetic. And I'm not talking about the Democrats.
[01:06:05.600 --> 01:06:07.920]   I'm talking about the November election.
[01:06:07.920 --> 01:06:14.960]   Seems we could do better, but maybe not. I mean, these guys are all the coronavirus target age.
[01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:16.960]   Good point. You know, like.
[01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:21.200]   They're all going to be at large public events with huge grounds.
[01:06:21.200 --> 01:06:25.120]   Oh, geez, Louise. You couldn't write this scenario, right?
[01:06:25.120 --> 01:06:29.840]   This is. Yeah, I will say during super Tuesday, as coronavirus fears were
[01:06:30.720 --> 01:06:35.680]   increasing exponentially, I was thinking, oh, God, this is at a time when so many people are
[01:06:35.680 --> 01:06:40.080]   in huge crowds waiting in lines together all around the nation.
[01:06:40.080 --> 01:06:45.280]   Well, you know what I struck me is we just we dodged a bullet at CES because there you have 180,000
[01:06:45.280 --> 01:06:53.200]   people, including probably 30% from China. Yeah. And by a hair's breadth, that did not become a
[01:06:53.200 --> 01:06:58.560]   breeding ground. But it sure could have been man. People always get sick at CES.
[01:06:58.560 --> 01:07:04.880]   Yeah, I was going to say like, like getting the CES flu is like part of the tradition.
[01:07:04.880 --> 01:07:06.320]   The fun. Yeah.
[01:07:06.320 --> 01:07:06.720]   Yeah.
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:06.720]   Yeah.
[01:07:06.720 --> 01:07:09.120]   Cleo, I have a tech story that doesn't have anything.
[01:07:09.120 --> 01:07:10.240]   Hold that thought.
[01:07:10.240 --> 01:07:11.600]   Yes. Okay.
[01:07:11.600 --> 01:07:14.480]   I'm going to do an ad because if I don't, we're going to be here all day.
[01:07:14.480 --> 01:07:23.120]   And then we'll come back with an actual tech story. Thanks to Brianna.
[01:07:23.120 --> 01:07:24.960]   Oh, my goodness. Brianna's here.
[01:07:25.680 --> 01:07:30.160]   Oh, I forgot. There is a woman still in the, in the election. Tulsi Gabbard. I completely
[01:07:30.160 --> 01:07:35.600]   forgot about it. I apologize. Yeah. Yes. Brianna Wu, she's running for Congress.
[01:07:35.600 --> 01:07:37.520]   She's present as she voted that one time.
[01:07:37.520 --> 01:07:40.160]   Present. That's right. Present.
[01:07:40.160 --> 01:07:46.480]   Tulsi is present. Brianna Wu, Canada for US Congress and the Massachusetts 8th at Brianna Wu.
[01:07:46.480 --> 01:07:48.640]   What is your website?
[01:07:48.640 --> 01:07:52.800]   It's Brianna Wu for Congress and support Brianna.com.
[01:07:52.800 --> 01:07:59.120]   Thank you. Also with us from Electric and nine to five. He's a publisher.
[01:07:59.120 --> 01:08:04.720]   He created all of those nine to five Google to nine to five Mac, Seth Wine Trub in his attic,
[01:08:04.720 --> 01:08:06.080]   where he is social distancing.
[01:08:06.080 --> 01:08:09.360]   Yes. I'm safe. I'm hiding away.
[01:08:09.360 --> 01:08:12.960]   Safe and erratic. He doesn't need an N95 mask. He doesn't have to shave
[01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:15.760]   because he's not going to go near anybody.
[01:08:16.880 --> 01:08:24.320]   Also with his Paris Martenot, she is a glass blower, a pot thrower, and writer for Wired.
[01:08:24.320 --> 01:08:26.560]   It's good to have you Paris.
[01:08:26.560 --> 01:08:28.240]   Always great to be here.
[01:08:28.240 --> 01:08:31.760]   Yeah. I always love having all three of you on. You're three of my favorite people.

[01:10:20.240 --> 01:10:22.800]   I'm a big fan of Stamps.com.
[01:10:22.800 --> 01:10:30.800]   All right, a tech story that mentions in no way the coronavirus, Brianna Wu.
[01:10:30.800 --> 01:10:32.720]   No way whatsoever.
[01:10:32.720 --> 01:10:38.000]   So I don't know if any of you saw this story, but I had to report to the FBI
[01:10:38.000 --> 01:10:44.320]   a intrusion attempt to hack my campaign and the webcams for my house.
[01:10:44.320 --> 01:10:46.800]   So there was a--
[01:10:46.800 --> 01:10:48.880]   We sent you a bunch of cameras. Was it them?
[01:10:48.880 --> 01:10:50.400]   No, it wasn't that.
[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:52.960]   It was the nest system there.
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:55.520]   So the weekly campaign--
[01:10:55.520 --> 01:10:58.000]   Yeah, I think we sent you ring system, didn't we?
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:58.480]   You did.
[01:10:59.840 --> 01:11:01.680]   Did you retire those after the hack?
[01:11:01.680 --> 01:11:04.320]   It's a great process.
[01:11:04.320 --> 01:11:07.120]   Okay, but you switched to nest.
[01:11:07.120 --> 01:11:13.680]   But the nest system, basically I did have to report this to the FBI and they are currently
[01:11:13.680 --> 01:11:16.880]   coming through all of my email addresses for that.
[01:11:16.880 --> 01:11:21.680]   I want to tell everyone here, like everyone in the show today, you're all journalists.
[01:11:21.680 --> 01:11:29.120]   I did go ahead and sign up for the Google highest security thing which anyone can opt into
[01:11:29.120 --> 01:11:31.920]   with one of these. This is a Google Titan key.
[01:11:31.920 --> 01:11:35.120]   There are two of them that come along with it.
[01:11:35.120 --> 01:11:38.720]   So all of us here, we've got multiple accounts.
[01:11:38.720 --> 01:11:43.680]   It's kind of a pain in the butt to have an additional security stuff, but the truth is TFA
[01:11:43.680 --> 01:11:49.040]   and SMS is not the safest way to secure your email account.
[01:11:49.040 --> 01:11:51.200]   So I can tell you we went through.
[01:11:51.200 --> 01:11:52.080]   I did this for--
[01:11:52.080 --> 01:11:54.880]   I did a full security audit top to bottom.
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:56.400]   We found other intrusions.
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:00.080]   And this is a very, very good system.
[01:12:00.080 --> 01:12:01.440]   It's mostly painless.
[01:12:01.440 --> 01:12:09.360]   It's a little bit quirky if you're all on iOS and there is a Bluetooth component to it that's inconvenient.
[01:12:09.360 --> 01:12:10.320]   They have USB-C.
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:10.320]   Yes.
[01:12:10.320 --> 01:12:11.120]   I think, right?
[01:12:11.120 --> 01:12:13.120]   It does have USB-C.
[01:12:13.120 --> 01:12:17.440]   I do it also, they're advanced protection and you don't have to use the Titan key.
[01:12:17.440 --> 01:12:23.440]   And I use this as a Yuba key, the 5CI that has both lightning on one end and type C on the other end.
[01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:25.440]   And then you can see this is on my keychain.
[01:12:25.440 --> 01:12:28.000]   I also carry an adapter for type A.
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:29.840]   So I use this key.
[01:12:29.840 --> 01:12:34.960]   And by the way, Google gives you two, but don't get one key in case you'll lose it.
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:42.240]   You can register multiple keys and it's probably a good idea to register the key you keep on your keychain
[01:12:42.240 --> 01:12:46.080]   and as well as the key that you put in your safe deposit box.
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:49.440]   Or I just keep it, I shouldn't say where, somewhere safe.
[01:12:49.440 --> 01:12:51.920]   So do you know how you were hacked?
[01:12:52.560 --> 01:12:59.120]   So one of the things, I just want to let the FBI do their job and not comment on it publicly.
[01:12:59.120 --> 01:13:01.200]   I think that's the best way to go forward there.
[01:13:01.200 --> 01:13:07.600]   I think I will say, I feel comfortable saying this, like most people I have many, many different
[01:13:07.600 --> 01:13:11.360]   accounts and one of my accounts I did not put TFA on.
[01:13:11.360 --> 01:13:12.560]   Yeah, we're tech people.
[01:13:12.560 --> 01:13:17.280]   I'm sure all of us have like 10, 15 email accounts here and one of the ones in the loop was,
[01:13:17.280 --> 01:13:18.720]   was vulnerable.
[01:13:18.720 --> 01:13:19.760]   All it takes is one.
[01:13:19.760 --> 01:13:21.520]   Yes. And that's exactly right.
[01:13:21.520 --> 01:13:24.080]   And I'm someone I use one password.
[01:13:24.080 --> 01:13:26.320]   I generate the longest string that I can.
[01:13:26.320 --> 01:13:32.160]   You've got to take this extremely seriously, especially if you have devices like security
[01:13:32.160 --> 01:13:33.200]   cams for your house.
[01:13:33.200 --> 01:13:41.200]   So I guess I just wanted to say the UB key slash Google Titan key, it's a very, very good product.
[01:13:41.200 --> 01:13:46.720]   And I think anyone that's at high risk of being targeted should consider this.
[01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:50.640]   Because there's a whole conversation to be had about the S seven backbone
[01:13:50.640 --> 01:13:51.680]   and how safe it is.
[01:13:51.680 --> 01:13:52.880]   Self-hones are not safe.
[01:13:52.880 --> 01:13:53.120]   Yeah.
[01:13:53.120 --> 01:13:53.440]   Period.
[01:13:53.440 --> 01:13:55.200]   No, they are that's a fact.
[01:13:55.200 --> 01:13:59.440]   This advanced protection program is free.
[01:13:59.440 --> 01:14:02.000]   Anybody who uses Google can use it.
[01:14:02.000 --> 01:14:06.480]   It's a step beyond just using an authenticator or text messaging.
[01:14:06.480 --> 01:14:08.480]   It uses these hardware dongles.
[01:14:08.480 --> 01:14:15.600]   They do in fact specifically say anyone at risk of targeted attacks like journalists,
[01:14:15.600 --> 01:14:18.720]   activists, business leaders and political campaign teams.
[01:14:18.720 --> 01:14:22.560]   And I think they created this in response to the DNC hack as I remember.
[01:14:22.560 --> 01:14:25.440]   So this is this is specific.
[01:14:25.440 --> 01:14:26.640]   You know, you're the target.
[01:14:26.640 --> 01:14:29.280]   But I also consider myself a target.
[01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:32.960]   And I always use hardware authentication.
[01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:35.280]   I just I feel like it's a great thing to do.
[01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:38.560]   In fact, there's a as the tech guy we did on authentication keys.
[01:14:38.560 --> 01:14:44.960]   I think one of the things that was really heartening for me, Leo, is you know,
[01:14:44.960 --> 01:14:49.760]   I dealt with the FBI a lot during game or gate, which also involved tech policy issues.
[01:14:49.760 --> 01:14:56.880]   And the conversation I had with them in 2020 was night and day.
[01:14:56.880 --> 01:15:03.280]   And I the impression I got is that they've had a lot of internal conversations because
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:05.440]   the level of education was stunning.
[01:15:05.440 --> 01:15:07.760]   Like the questions they were asking me were,
[01:15:07.760 --> 01:15:13.280]   have you been using a VPM to access?
[01:15:13.280 --> 01:15:16.880]   And that's a pretty insightful question for the FBI to ask you, you know,
[01:15:16.880 --> 01:15:19.840]   because that would throw off false positives if you've been hacked.
[01:15:19.840 --> 01:15:24.720]   So I was just really impressed by how much better they were today than five years ago.
[01:15:24.720 --> 01:15:26.240]   That's encouraging.
[01:15:26.240 --> 01:15:28.720]   By the way, Google also will let you in.
[01:15:28.720 --> 01:15:31.200]   This is a newer feature of advanced protection.
[01:15:31.200 --> 01:15:34.640]   Use your phone as a physical authentication key.
[01:15:34.640 --> 01:15:38.080]   So my phone is one of my phones.
[01:15:38.080 --> 01:15:40.640]   I won't show you which one is registered as an authentication key,
[01:15:40.640 --> 01:15:42.240]   as well as the physical Yuba key.
[01:15:42.240 --> 01:15:45.680]   And that's that makes it a little bit easier.
[01:15:45.680 --> 01:15:50.320]   You can add external keys, but it's nice that you can use an Android or iOS device,
[01:15:50.320 --> 01:15:51.840]   even a Mac or Windows PC.
[01:15:51.840 --> 01:15:54.560]   So I'm not a fan of that.
[01:15:54.560 --> 01:15:56.480]   My team wanted to use that.
[01:15:56.480 --> 01:16:00.160]   And I just thought it I mean, I know there are ways to get away.
[01:16:00.160 --> 01:16:03.680]   Use this Bluetooth, which is the most secure thing in the world.
[01:16:03.680 --> 01:16:04.080]   Yeah.
[01:16:04.080 --> 01:16:04.400]   Right.
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:08.320]   There there's just I think if you're trying to reach the highest level,
[01:16:08.320 --> 01:16:10.400]   if you're going to do this, do it right, basically.
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:10.720]   I agree.
[01:16:10.720 --> 01:16:11.600]   Thank you.
[01:16:11.600 --> 01:16:19.040]   And of course, remember that the lowest hanging fruit in your security chain is the
[01:16:19.040 --> 01:16:20.160]   one hackers will attack.
[01:16:20.160 --> 01:16:24.720]   So if you are using, and I see this all the time with banks, especially,
[01:16:24.720 --> 01:16:27.840]   they'll let you use better to factor like an authenticator,
[01:16:27.840 --> 01:16:31.040]   but they always fall back to SMS text messaging.
[01:16:31.040 --> 01:16:34.720]   And that means you're no more secure than if you were just using text messaging.
[01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:38.240]   If a hacker can say, oh, I lost my key.
[01:16:38.240 --> 01:16:38.880]   Oh, don't worry.
[01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:42.400]   We'll text you a key that isn't good security.
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:43.840]   Yeah.
[01:16:43.840 --> 01:16:44.640]   Well, I'm sorry.
[01:16:44.640 --> 01:16:46.960]   SMS Jack to then.
[01:16:46.960 --> 01:16:47.840]   Yeah.
[01:16:47.840 --> 01:16:49.040]   You can get SMS Jack.
[01:16:49.040 --> 01:16:49.280]   Yeah.
[01:16:49.280 --> 01:16:50.240]   It happens all the time.
[01:16:50.240 --> 01:16:51.920]   I'm sorry that that happened to you, Brandon.
[01:16:51.920 --> 01:16:54.400]   I'm glad that the FBI is working on it.
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:55.280]   I hope they catch it.
[01:16:55.280 --> 01:16:55.760]   Well, it was.
[01:16:55.760 --> 01:16:56.320]   Do they think it was.
[01:16:56.320 --> 01:16:58.160]   Yeah, sorry.
[01:16:58.160 --> 01:16:59.520]   I think it was a state actor.
[01:16:59.520 --> 01:17:01.840]   They haven't said either way.
[01:17:01.840 --> 01:17:02.960]   I don't know.
[01:17:03.600 --> 01:17:09.200]   It was a real gut check moment for me, especially talking publicly about it,
[01:17:09.200 --> 01:17:12.800]   because I'm obviously running a cybersecurity platform.
[01:17:12.800 --> 01:17:17.680]   And it's frankly embarrassing that, you know, I know what the best course of action is.
[01:17:17.680 --> 01:17:22.560]   I talk about it all the time and to have made a stupid mistake and to still have been.
[01:17:22.560 --> 01:17:23.520]   Oh, no, no, no, no.
[01:17:23.520 --> 01:17:24.160]   Yeah, I found it.
[01:17:24.160 --> 01:17:25.200]   It's embarrassing.
[01:17:25.200 --> 01:17:25.760]   Don't beat up.
[01:17:25.760 --> 01:17:29.600]   Well, I'm just, but I thought it was the right thing to do to come forward and say,
[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:30.720]   look, this happened to me.
[01:17:30.720 --> 01:17:33.200]   This is something all campaigns need to take seriously.
[01:17:33.200 --> 01:17:35.440]   I'm not even an elected official yet.
[01:17:35.440 --> 01:17:36.720]   And I'm being targeted.
[01:17:36.720 --> 01:17:40.720]   The thing to remember is there are really two kinds of attacks in the world.
[01:17:40.720 --> 01:17:42.400]   There are general fishing attacks.
[01:17:42.400 --> 01:17:44.960]   Those are much easier to defend against.
[01:17:44.960 --> 01:17:48.880]   If you're a target, it is very difficult.
[01:17:48.880 --> 01:17:54.960]   And ultimately, if you're a target of a state actor, it's almost impossible to be honest.
[01:17:54.960 --> 01:17:58.000]   Brianna is the target of a variety of,
[01:17:58.000 --> 01:18:02.240]   because as you may remember and may know already, she was one of the targets of gamer gates.
[01:18:02.240 --> 01:18:04.320]   So you have lots of enemies.
[01:18:04.320 --> 01:18:04.880]   I'm sorry.
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:05.360]   I do.
[01:18:05.360 --> 01:18:07.280]   I had the best enemies.
[01:18:07.280 --> 01:18:10.240]   Well, I would say the worst to creepiest anyway.
[01:18:10.240 --> 01:18:12.480]   And so I'm really sorry that happened.
[01:18:12.480 --> 01:18:16.320]   And you can't, yeah, you can't assume it was political or a nation.
[01:18:16.320 --> 01:18:20.000]   I have good reason to believe it was political.
[01:18:20.000 --> 01:18:20.480]   It was.
[01:18:20.480 --> 01:18:20.960]   Okay.
[01:18:20.960 --> 01:18:21.520]   Yeah.
[01:18:21.520 --> 01:18:22.880]   Don't say too much.
[01:18:22.880 --> 01:18:24.640]   Investigation ongoing.
[01:18:24.640 --> 01:18:28.560]   I look forward to reporting on a future this week in tech that they got them.
[01:18:30.080 --> 01:18:31.360]   They were taking them all in.
[01:18:31.360 --> 01:18:33.280]   They're hauling them all in.
[01:18:33.280 --> 01:18:40.000]   Actually, there is a related story because Patrick Wardle, who is a former NSA hacker,
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:45.120]   white hat hacker, and now does security for Jamf, which is a big apple,
[01:18:45.120 --> 01:18:47.760]   consultant.
[01:18:47.760 --> 01:18:50.080]   He also writes some of the best.
[01:18:50.080 --> 01:18:52.560]   I really like his security utilities for Macintosh.
[01:18:53.440 --> 01:18:59.920]   He showed how at the RSA conference, how easy it is to repurpose nation state malware
[01:18:59.920 --> 01:19:02.560]   as just a little guy hacker.
[01:19:02.560 --> 01:19:09.920]   He actually demonstrated that the problem is, you see, this nation state stuff.
[01:19:09.920 --> 01:19:13.920]   And he was using NSA exploits, which were exfiltrated.
[01:19:13.920 --> 01:19:20.320]   The problem with these is that once they're out, anybody can weaponize them and use them
[01:19:20.320 --> 01:19:23.920]   for ransomware. We know that Eternal Blue, one of the NSA's
[01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:28.240]   exploits was used for not pet you and want to cry.
[01:19:28.240 --> 01:19:34.320]   And so he talked a little bit about how easy it is to use these nation state malware,
[01:19:34.320 --> 01:19:37.280]   then to execute second stage payloads.
[01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:42.400]   And I should point out that this was on Macs.
[01:19:42.400 --> 01:19:45.120]   So those of you saying, oh, no, well, at least I'm on a Macintosh.
[01:19:45.120 --> 01:19:45.680]   I'm safe.
[01:19:45.680 --> 01:19:45.920]   No.
[01:19:45.920 --> 01:19:49.520]   No, it can hit.
[01:19:49.520 --> 01:19:51.200]   This is a really scary story, Lee.
[01:19:51.200 --> 01:19:51.440]   Yeah.
[01:19:51.440 --> 01:19:58.160]   I mean, this is like someone getting a tank, like a weapon made by our government and using it
[01:19:58.160 --> 01:20:00.800]   against people or having the potential to do that.
[01:20:00.800 --> 01:20:04.880]   And I think it speaks to the fact that I think as a matter of policy,
[01:20:04.880 --> 01:20:07.040]   we don't need to be stockpiling zero days.
[01:20:07.040 --> 01:20:14.000]   We need a very specific policy to make Microsoft Apple, different operating system people
[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:16.560]   aware of this so they can start patching it.
[01:20:16.560 --> 01:20:22.240]   And I think as a nation, we need to start developing a process to make sure our schools,
[01:20:22.240 --> 01:20:28.960]   our hospitals, our financial institutions are incentivized to update their software,
[01:20:28.960 --> 01:20:31.360]   because this is out there.
[01:20:31.360 --> 01:20:33.680]   And you see how easy it is from this story.
[01:20:33.680 --> 01:20:37.200]   And it's something where we basically we have the coronavirus playbook here.
[01:20:37.200 --> 01:20:44.880]   It does kind of raise the question of, as we see more and more nations pursuing
[01:20:44.880 --> 01:20:46.960]   backdoors in encryption.
[01:20:46.960 --> 01:20:50.560]   It's not merely the use of malware.
[01:20:50.560 --> 01:20:56.880]   It's that police authorities can't really be trusted to hold on to these things,
[01:20:56.880 --> 01:20:58.160]   that they escape.
[01:20:58.160 --> 01:21:00.240]   It's almost impossible not to have them escape.
[01:21:00.240 --> 01:21:00.800]   Yeah.
[01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:01.200]   Yeah.
[01:21:01.200 --> 01:21:05.680]   If there's a backdoor, bad guys are going to get it eventually.
[01:21:05.680 --> 01:21:06.560]   Yeah.
[01:21:06.560 --> 01:21:13.360]   And I think some people I hear, I mean, I don't think the United States necessarily needs to
[01:21:13.920 --> 01:21:16.320]   say we're not going to be developing cyber weapons.
[01:21:16.320 --> 01:21:16.800]   I mean,
[01:21:16.800 --> 01:21:17.760]   Well, that's the question.
[01:21:17.760 --> 01:21:19.680]   How do you not do that?
[01:21:19.680 --> 01:21:23.200]   I mean, isn't that the new war is cyber warfare?
[01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:23.520]   It's not.
[01:21:23.520 --> 01:21:30.720]   I think, you know, I think it's an area of national security.
[01:21:30.720 --> 01:21:32.400]   We need to look at very closely.
[01:21:32.400 --> 01:21:38.800]   I think a ban would be very counterproductive, but we've cleared what I want to see us emphasize
[01:21:38.800 --> 01:21:43.440]   the defensive aspects of it more, because it feels like we're thinking more about the
[01:21:43.440 --> 01:21:47.680]   offensive and how we're going to target other people and get their data.
[01:21:47.680 --> 01:21:51.440]   But because we've thought so little about the defensive aspects of that,
[01:21:51.440 --> 01:21:53.680]   you know, as people like you and I, we're paying the price.
[01:21:53.680 --> 01:21:58.480]   So I just think there's a very serious discussion we need to have.
[01:21:58.480 --> 01:22:02.880]   It's in a way a very similar discussion in nuclear proliferation.
[01:22:02.880 --> 01:22:04.640]   We're exactly the same.
[01:22:04.640 --> 01:22:05.040]   Yeah.
[01:22:05.040 --> 01:22:05.520]   Yeah.
[01:22:05.520 --> 01:22:09.840]   You know, we decided, uh, you know, we can't not have nuclear weapons.
[01:22:09.840 --> 01:22:14.480]   And I think you could probably make the case that the doctrine of mutually assured destruction
[01:22:14.480 --> 01:22:20.400]   is what kept us from getting in a nuclear war in the 50s and 60s, because the Soviet Union knew
[01:22:20.400 --> 01:22:24.240]   that to launch an attack in the United States was to, in effect, commit suicide.
[01:22:24.240 --> 01:22:28.560]   But that does not justify the proliferation of nuclear weapons.
[01:22:28.560 --> 01:22:30.800]   If they exist, eventually they become more dangerous.
[01:22:30.800 --> 01:22:32.080]   And so you have to balance it too.
[01:22:32.080 --> 01:22:32.960]   And it's very difficult.
[01:22:32.960 --> 01:22:33.840]   Yeah.
[01:22:33.840 --> 01:22:35.360]   I don't, I really don't know.
[01:22:36.560 --> 01:22:42.880]   That's the risk of cyber warfare is escalation could be devastating to both sides.
[01:22:42.880 --> 01:22:45.360]   I mean, not in the same way a nuclear war would be, but still.
[01:22:45.360 --> 01:22:48.240]   But I mean, look at Stuxnet, right?
[01:22:48.240 --> 01:22:53.920]   Like we had, we had these nuclear reactors and someone could have gone in and, you know,
[01:22:53.920 --> 01:22:58.560]   bombed it or sent a special forces team in there and people would have gotten killed.
[01:22:58.560 --> 01:23:00.640]   And instead someone developed a cyber weapon.
[01:23:00.640 --> 01:23:02.400]   You shut that down remotely.
[01:23:02.400 --> 01:23:06.160]   And I mean, I think there's a, it worked.
[01:23:06.160 --> 01:23:11.680]   And I don't want to take options like that off the table.
[01:23:11.680 --> 01:23:20.000]   I just think that, I think that we've really got to have a process that people stick to for
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.600]   updating their software.
[01:23:21.600 --> 01:23:21.840]   Yeah.
[01:23:21.840 --> 01:23:28.240]   I feel very, very strongly that stockpiling zero days is a reckless thing for any security
[01:23:28.240 --> 01:23:32.080]   agency to be doing because yes, maybe you can use it on other countries,
[01:23:32.080 --> 01:23:34.640]   but you're also leaving the American people unsafe.
[01:23:35.200 --> 01:23:39.440]   So I think that we need to really change our policies on that.
[01:23:39.440 --> 01:23:44.800]   Sorry.
[01:23:44.800 --> 01:23:47.040]   So cheerful.
[01:23:47.040 --> 01:23:57.440]   I could bring up crypto AG, which is the supposedly Swiss company creating
[01:23:57.440 --> 01:24:04.320]   cryptography tools turned out it was owned by the CIA and the German secret service.
[01:24:04.320 --> 01:24:05.760]   Just all good news.
[01:24:05.760 --> 01:24:07.040]   Oh, whoops.
[01:24:07.040 --> 01:24:10.240]   Made millions of dollars selling equipment to more than 120 countries,
[01:24:10.240 --> 01:24:13.120]   all of which, by the way, was compromised by the CIA and the,
[01:24:13.120 --> 01:24:17.520]   and the, was it the BND, the DGRD?
[01:24:17.520 --> 01:24:21.280]   I can't remember the German secrets intelligence.
[01:24:21.280 --> 01:24:28.720]   And I can't find the story, but somebody who's really pissed off and about like to sue
[01:24:28.720 --> 01:24:34.000]   because they bought all these gear and it turned out the CIA was listening in the BND.
[01:24:34.000 --> 01:24:34.480]   Thank you.
[01:24:34.480 --> 01:24:39.440]   It's a good audit argument for code auditing and open source right there.
[01:24:39.440 --> 01:24:40.000]   Oh gosh.
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:42.320]   I've said this for years, but now it's true.
[01:24:42.320 --> 01:24:44.560]   Never use a crypto tool.
[01:24:44.560 --> 01:24:45.600]   It is an open source.
[01:24:45.600 --> 01:24:46.960]   Yes, I agree.
[01:24:46.960 --> 01:24:49.200]   Especially if it's from the CIA.
[01:24:49.200 --> 01:24:56.480]   So Apple has been criticized for using
[01:24:56.480 --> 01:24:59.840]   push notifications to promote their own products.
[01:24:59.840 --> 01:25:03.520]   We did a story a couple of weeks ago about how Apple was advertising their own products.
[01:25:03.520 --> 01:25:08.080]   In fact, being essentially an annoying ad platform on the iPhone.
[01:25:08.080 --> 01:25:09.600]   Yeah, that's getting really bad.
[01:25:09.600 --> 01:25:10.640]   It really is, isn't it?
[01:25:10.640 --> 01:25:14.880]   You can't use Apple music without being told, you need to buy this.
[01:25:14.880 --> 01:25:16.080]   Right.
[01:25:16.080 --> 01:25:19.280]   Well, apparently.
[01:25:19.280 --> 01:25:22.000]   That'd be a lot worse.
[01:25:22.000 --> 01:25:23.120]   It's about to get a lot worse.
[01:25:23.120 --> 01:25:30.080]   Apple had developer guidelines that said you cannot send ads via push notifications,
[01:25:30.080 --> 01:25:30.560]   right?
[01:25:30.560 --> 01:25:31.600]   We can do it, but you can't.
[01:25:33.360 --> 01:25:36.320]   Developers were doing it, but now it's okay.
[01:25:36.320 --> 01:25:41.440]   Apple updated its developer guidelines this week.
[01:25:41.440 --> 01:25:45.680]   And saying as long as users opt in, it's okay.
[01:25:45.680 --> 01:25:49.440]   Here's what I'll say about this.
[01:25:49.440 --> 01:25:54.240]   Since 2016, at least, I've had my phone on Do Not Disturb mode.
[01:25:54.240 --> 01:25:55.920]   Silence is all about all the time.
[01:25:55.920 --> 01:25:57.200]   All the time.
[01:25:57.200 --> 01:25:58.800]   Haven't taken it off.
[01:25:58.800 --> 01:26:01.440]   Four years would highly recommend it.
[01:26:01.440 --> 01:26:03.280]   I have to do that because of you, Paris.
[01:26:03.280 --> 01:26:06.320]   If you can contact with you right now, they can call you.
[01:26:06.320 --> 01:26:10.800]   You can try that so that calls will go through or certain apps will go through.
[01:26:10.800 --> 01:26:15.600]   Or you could say just my starred favorites will go through, and then I don't have to hear from anybody.
[01:26:15.600 --> 01:26:16.160]   That's fine.
[01:26:16.160 --> 01:26:16.720]   Yeah.
[01:26:16.720 --> 01:26:21.040]   Other than that, you can get a notification when you open your phone to look at it.
[01:26:21.040 --> 01:26:23.200]   It will be there waiting for you.
[01:26:23.200 --> 01:26:24.240]   Isn't that awesome?
[01:26:24.240 --> 01:26:26.960]   I think it was you that I think you said that you were doing this.
[01:26:26.960 --> 01:26:27.840]   I don't maybe wrote it.
[01:26:27.840 --> 01:26:29.040]   You write an article about it.
[01:26:29.040 --> 01:26:29.840]   I think I did, yeah.
[01:26:29.840 --> 01:26:30.480]   Yeah.
[01:26:30.480 --> 01:26:31.520]   And I said, that's brilliant.
[01:26:31.520 --> 01:26:32.640]   Just leave it on all the time.
[01:26:32.640 --> 01:26:33.840]   Yeah.
[01:26:33.840 --> 01:26:34.640]   Leave it on.
[01:26:34.640 --> 01:26:36.000]   Never turn it off.
[01:26:36.000 --> 01:26:37.280]   Your life will change.
[01:26:37.280 --> 01:26:39.600]   It was a IOU.
[01:26:39.600 --> 01:26:41.600]   Brilliant thought.
[01:26:41.600 --> 01:26:46.160]   And you can say if it's in the fact this is what I do, if the person is in my context,
[01:26:46.160 --> 01:26:47.280]   they can ring through.
[01:26:47.280 --> 01:26:50.080]   So that way, I don't get any robo calls.
[01:26:50.080 --> 01:26:54.960]   Unfortunately, I don't get calls from my doctor, but I don't really want to hear from them anyway.
[01:26:54.960 --> 01:26:56.160]   You can just call them back.
[01:26:56.160 --> 01:26:56.960]   Yeah.
[01:26:56.960 --> 01:26:58.480]   And that's what I figure.
[01:26:58.480 --> 01:27:00.320]   If it's important, you'd leave a message.
[01:27:00.320 --> 01:27:04.000]   A Leo, the test results are in.
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:05.360]   Maybe you should call me.
[01:27:05.360 --> 01:27:07.200]   You've been drinking.
[01:27:07.200 --> 01:27:09.520]   Then you can just read that on your voicemail because it's
[01:27:09.520 --> 01:27:12.000]   automatically written in text and then give them a call back.
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:12.960]   Yeah.
[01:27:12.960 --> 01:27:16.080]   So a little, it looks like you've been drinking a lot of
[01:27:16.080 --> 01:27:16.960]   Soylent lately.
[01:27:16.960 --> 01:27:19.360]   It's very junky.
[01:27:19.360 --> 01:27:20.320]   Perhaps expired.
[01:27:20.320 --> 01:27:26.800]   Have you been drinking expired Soylent Leo because your blood chemistry is a little strange.
[01:27:28.080 --> 01:27:32.960]   Yeah. I think the idea of ads, it's bad enough, but ads and push notifications,
[01:27:32.960 --> 01:27:33.840]   it's going to be very annoying.
[01:27:33.840 --> 01:27:35.360]   I guess they have to ask your permission.
[01:27:35.360 --> 01:27:40.080]   But at the moment, I mean, that's how they're going to bring it in, right?
[01:27:40.080 --> 01:27:44.000]   At first, they have to ask your permission and then it's going to reverse where you have
[01:27:44.000 --> 01:27:46.960]   to opt out and then eventually you'll just be stuck with it.
[01:27:46.960 --> 01:27:48.160]   Why would Apple do that?
[01:27:48.160 --> 01:27:49.760]   Money.
[01:27:49.760 --> 01:27:51.200]   Apple's a goal.
[01:27:51.200 --> 01:27:53.120]   Why did anybody put ads anywhere?
[01:27:53.120 --> 01:27:54.480]   Money.
[01:27:54.480 --> 01:27:54.960]   Oh, yeah.
[01:27:54.960 --> 01:27:55.440]   Oh, money.
[01:27:55.440 --> 01:27:56.160]   Let's do an ad.
[01:27:57.280 --> 01:27:57.760]   Speak.
[01:27:57.760 --> 01:28:00.320]   Speak in a money.
[01:28:00.320 --> 01:28:02.880]   Speak in a money.
[01:28:02.880 --> 01:28:03.760]   We got a little ad.
[01:28:03.760 --> 01:28:04.240]   Do we have it?
[01:28:04.240 --> 01:28:05.040]   We have a promo, right?
[01:28:05.040 --> 01:28:06.480]   Oh, never mind.
[01:28:06.480 --> 01:28:09.520]   I don't have to do an ad, but I'll do one anyway.
[01:28:09.520 --> 01:28:11.920]   Our show today brought to you by FreshBooks.
[01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:14.800]   This is actually an ad for something I used for many years.
[01:28:14.800 --> 01:28:18.720]   I was a freelancer going up to Canada doing the TV show up there,
[01:28:18.720 --> 01:28:19.920]   but I hated invoicing.
[01:28:19.920 --> 01:28:20.480]   Who doesn't?
[01:28:20.480 --> 01:28:21.040]   Right.
[01:28:21.040 --> 01:28:23.440]   You know when you get bills, end of the month, you got to pay them.
[01:28:23.440 --> 01:28:24.480]   I hate that.
[01:28:24.480 --> 01:28:27.120]   Well, it turns out making the bills is just as much of a pain.
[01:28:27.120 --> 01:28:28.880]   I found FreshBooks.
[01:28:28.880 --> 01:28:29.680]   My life changed.
[01:28:29.680 --> 01:28:34.400]   It makes it easy to create invoices and put the expenses in there.
[01:28:34.400 --> 01:28:35.600]   There's a great FreshBooks app.
[01:28:35.600 --> 01:28:36.880]   You could take a picture of receipts.
[01:28:36.880 --> 01:28:38.640]   They're automatically added to the invoice.
[01:28:38.640 --> 01:28:40.720]   And here's the amazing thing.
[01:28:40.720 --> 01:28:43.600]   When you do your invoices and your expenses through FreshBooks,
[01:28:43.600 --> 01:28:47.840]   it turns out you're doing bookkeeping without even thinking about it.

[01:30:44.560 --> 01:30:49.920]   Apparently, one of the complaints I've had for a long time,
[01:30:49.920 --> 01:30:50.800]   and I'm not alone.
[01:30:50.800 --> 01:30:54.080]   A lot of people complain about the fact that YouTube's recommendation engine
[01:30:54.080 --> 01:30:56.800]   just pushes you to extremism.
[01:30:56.800 --> 01:31:03.760]   Well, there's been some research that indicates maybe YouTube is getting better.
[01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:06.800]   A study published by the University of California last month
[01:31:06.800 --> 01:31:16.000]   says that a 40% reduction in the likelihood of YouTube suggesting conspiracy theory content.
[01:31:18.320 --> 01:31:21.920]   Okay, maybe they're not helping you not be a terrorist, but at least you're not thinking the
[01:31:21.920 --> 01:31:23.760]   world is flat when you do it.
[01:31:23.760 --> 01:31:28.640]   They analyzed 8 million recommended videos over the course of a year,
[01:31:28.640 --> 01:31:34.800]   hundreds of conspiracy and non-conspiracy videos so they could determine which was which,
[01:31:34.800 --> 01:31:38.640]   and then they ran those programs.
[01:31:38.640 --> 01:31:43.920]   It turned out that watching the videos wasn't that useful.
[01:31:44.480 --> 01:31:49.920]   The transcripts, the metadata, and the comments, top 200 comments of each video
[01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:53.280]   really helped you determine whether this video is a little nutty.
[01:31:53.280 --> 01:31:56.640]   They could tell from the comments.
[01:31:56.640 --> 01:32:01.200]   I mean, overall, I guess this is, of course, good news,
[01:32:01.200 --> 01:32:06.160]   but I think something that's important to keep in mind here is that the recommendation
[01:32:06.160 --> 01:32:11.120]   algorithm plays a very minor role in these sort of things as much as people like to
[01:32:11.120 --> 01:32:16.240]   attribute all of radicalization through YouTube to something like the recommendation algorithm.
[01:32:16.240 --> 01:32:22.080]   A lot of research has come out in the past year that indicates that that's not really the case.
[01:32:22.080 --> 01:32:23.040]   What is it then?
[01:32:23.040 --> 01:32:25.200]   Why is YouTube hotbed for extremely?
[01:32:25.200 --> 01:32:33.760]   I spoke to some researchers in what was it, October of last year, who had worked on this
[01:32:33.760 --> 01:32:37.920]   really interesting study that was kind of going over a lot of the different research that had been
[01:32:37.920 --> 01:32:43.760]   done online extremism on YouTube, and they also did a lot of their own, and they found that
[01:32:43.760 --> 01:32:46.000]   it's not really the recommendation algorithm that is playing.
[01:32:46.000 --> 01:32:53.200]   The largest role is radicalizing rabbit hole, but it is the communities themselves that form around
[01:32:53.200 --> 01:33:00.000]   extremist content and those communities that are pushing users farther and farther into the
[01:33:00.000 --> 01:33:04.720]   rabbit hole from interacting with others who believe in these kind of views, as well as,
[01:33:04.720 --> 01:33:10.880]   if you've ever, the researcher, Becca Lewis at Stanford, has had some really interesting work
[01:33:10.880 --> 01:33:15.280]   on this subject in particular kind of her.
[01:33:15.280 --> 01:33:20.880]   Number one piece is called alternative influence, which is like a fantastic guide if anybody ever
[01:33:20.880 --> 01:33:26.480]   wants to read academic papers about this, but it kind of speaks to how the reason that this
[01:33:26.480 --> 01:33:30.720]   community, these communities are getting worse and worse and people are increasingly radicalized
[01:33:30.720 --> 01:33:37.840]   by them is because they cross populate. If you're watching a video from one kind of milder
[01:33:37.840 --> 01:33:44.000]   YouTube star in this spear, he'll be a guest on somebody who's more extreme, or other people
[01:33:44.000 --> 01:33:49.280]   will be a guest on their show, and they kind of all connect in ways that are much more,
[01:33:49.280 --> 01:33:54.240]   much more difficult to track and get a handle on them and attribute this all to than just saying.
[01:33:54.240 --> 01:33:59.040]   That's bad news because YouTube can't fix it.
[01:33:59.760 --> 01:34:03.920]   You know, it's bad news because the problem is systemic and is much, much harder to fix,
[01:34:03.920 --> 01:34:07.280]   and it's never going to be as easy as saying, "Well, why doesn't YouTube fix the
[01:34:07.280 --> 01:34:10.480]   radical, the recommendation?" But I'd really rather blame YouTube.
[01:34:10.480 --> 01:34:15.520]   Yeah, I know. Wouldn't that be a lot easier? I mean, YouTube certainly still has a lot of
[01:34:15.520 --> 01:34:19.760]   role and blame to play here. I'm never going to be an apologist for tech platforms, but
[01:34:19.760 --> 01:34:25.280]   they should a lot bigger. Radicalization, it turns out, happens the old-fashioned way.
[01:34:25.280 --> 01:34:28.000]   People were recognizing them one another.
[01:34:28.880 --> 01:34:36.960]   Mm-hmm. I think, I think, and I just want to say, anecdote is not data, right? But my experience
[01:34:36.960 --> 01:34:44.320]   with this is I watch all my videos on gamer culture, on car repair, on those kinds of subjects,
[01:34:44.320 --> 01:34:51.040]   things that are kind of tangential to, you know, some, like gamer culture has a bit of an extremism
[01:34:51.040 --> 01:34:57.520]   problem. And I certainly in the past have been watching the YouTube algorithm, and it's recommended
[01:34:57.520 --> 01:35:05.840]   to me that's just not someone I want to be listening to at all. I've certainly seen that
[01:35:05.840 --> 01:35:11.120]   decrease over the last few years. And, you know, Paris, I agree with you, but I think,
[01:35:11.120 --> 01:35:20.080]   I think the worry with this is you have people that are maybe watching, say, a, you know, like a
[01:35:20.080 --> 01:35:24.960]   video from IGN or something like that, and suddenly find themselves watching, you know, one of these
[01:35:24.960 --> 01:35:29.920]   far fringe-right people that talk about gamer culture. And I do think that shows up in the
[01:35:29.920 --> 01:35:36.800]   recommendation algorithm. Yeah, I mean, it definitely does. And I've seen that I can only myself,
[01:35:36.800 --> 01:35:40.800]   but I think just something that is interesting to think about is that, I mean, there one have been
[01:35:40.800 --> 01:35:47.200]   no studies that specifically say, or have ever been able to prove, that the recommendation
[01:35:47.200 --> 01:35:53.120]   algorithm is the key thing that is radicalizing people here. And, of course, it has certainly
[01:35:53.120 --> 01:36:00.800]   played a large role in introducing people to new content. But the, like, there are so many
[01:36:00.800 --> 01:36:09.360]   different factors and forces behind the radicalization rabbit hole that people fall into on YouTube.
[01:36:09.360 --> 01:36:15.360]   And it is a much bigger and more complicated and difficult to handle problem than just the
[01:36:15.360 --> 01:36:19.840]   recommendation algorithm, which means that our response and any possible solutions are going to
[01:36:19.840 --> 01:36:25.600]   have to attack it from 70 sides rather than one. Well, one thing YouTube has done, and we knew
[01:36:25.600 --> 01:36:32.400]   what would do this. We just didn't understand the consequences is democratize speech used to be
[01:36:32.400 --> 01:36:36.640]   there were gatekeepers, and you couldn't get a radio show or a TV show unless you got past the
[01:36:36.640 --> 01:36:41.600]   gatekeepers or in, you know, a New York Times article. YouTube made it possible for anybody to
[01:36:41.600 --> 01:36:49.120]   make videos. And many of these people have found an audience and have a voice that they might not
[01:36:49.120 --> 01:36:53.840]   have had if YouTube didn't exist. And they're able to make money from it.
[01:36:53.840 --> 01:36:54.880]   And you need to get money.
[01:36:54.880 --> 01:37:00.400]   I mean, so that's one thing that these researchers at Penn State had found in a study that I covered
[01:37:00.400 --> 01:37:07.200]   in October, which I thought was really interesting, is that what they see is one of the primary reasons
[01:37:07.200 --> 01:37:13.680]   why a lot of far-right radicalization has happened due to YouTube is because there is
[01:37:15.040 --> 01:37:21.520]   the platform is allowed for a massive increase in supply specifically of these sort of alternative
[01:37:21.520 --> 01:37:28.160]   influencing media figures in this specific area because previously, like you said, media used to
[01:37:28.160 --> 01:37:34.400]   just be the domain of people who had access to a fancy studio and a bunch of screens for other
[01:37:34.400 --> 01:37:40.400]   people to sit around them. More importantly, corporate America got to say who got to speak and who didn't,
[01:37:40.400 --> 01:37:46.560]   and they made damn sure no crazies got or they tried anyway. And now anybody who has a phone or
[01:37:46.560 --> 01:37:50.960]   computer, they can make YouTube. Which is an incredibly bad, I think, free speech. But it just
[01:37:50.960 --> 01:37:55.280]   means that you're going it's great. I mean, that we've all had this opportunity, but it means that
[01:37:55.280 --> 01:38:00.320]   you're going to have this giant outpouring of content and people who want certain types of
[01:38:00.320 --> 01:38:06.000]   perhaps more extreme content have the pick of the bunch. There is something interesting with
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:13.200]   YouTube that puzzles me a little bit coming from mainstream traditional media. There is a affinity.
[01:38:13.200 --> 01:38:20.640]   There's a power that YouTube has that even transcends the intense power of television in general.
[01:38:20.640 --> 01:38:25.680]   Television can make stars by bringing somebody's face and personality into your living room,
[01:38:25.680 --> 01:38:31.840]   and it has made massive stars. But it seems to me YouTube can do that too, and maybe even more so,
[01:38:32.480 --> 01:38:36.640]   and you go all you have to do is go to VidCon. And by the way, it's not just YouTube anymore.
[01:38:36.640 --> 01:38:43.920]   It's TikTok. It's Instagram. It's all about talking about influencer culture.
[01:38:43.920 --> 01:38:50.320]   Yeah, let me ask you though, isn't that something different than celebrity in the mid-century?
[01:38:50.320 --> 01:38:58.080]   Absolutely. I mean, it's because the way that people generally, and we kind of think about
[01:38:58.720 --> 01:39:03.840]   other people's postings on social media and the way we kind of interact with it, it seems more
[01:39:03.840 --> 01:39:10.960]   authentic. It seems more intimate that you are watching somebody maybe from an early day when
[01:39:10.960 --> 01:39:15.040]   they were just like you just had a couple hundred followers on YouTube, couple hundred subscribers.
[01:39:15.040 --> 01:39:21.280]   You can still have the illusion that PewDiePie is talking directly to me. When you're watching
[01:39:21.280 --> 01:39:28.560]   Jimmy Fallon on the network, there's no sense of, oh yeah, this is my guy as much as when you're
[01:39:28.560 --> 01:39:32.240]   watching this. Yeah, it was clearly professionalism. There's that wall, that corporate wall, but on
[01:39:32.240 --> 01:39:36.080]   YouTube, you're seeing this person cheat. You follow along with their Snapchat videos.
[01:39:36.080 --> 01:39:41.600]   I see it a little differently though. I think it's more about hypersegmentation. I mean,
[01:39:41.600 --> 01:39:46.480]   I remember when I first started watching and listening to your network, Leo, it was about a
[01:39:46.480 --> 01:39:52.320]   hypersegmentation of the tech audience that corporate tech coverage was missing. And I think
[01:39:52.320 --> 01:40:00.960]   YouTube has really accelerated this hypersegmentation. I love nerf rival guns. I have all of them and
[01:40:00.960 --> 01:40:07.040]   I get into battles with my husband constantly with them. There are channels out there that focus
[01:40:07.040 --> 01:40:13.200]   on nerf rival content. There are channels out there that go, hey, are you a feminist gamer that
[01:40:13.200 --> 01:40:18.640]   want news and coverage about classic games starring women characters? Hey, let's bring out this cool
[01:40:18.640 --> 01:40:22.880]   feminist woman that's going to have. And there's a whole lot of channels about there. So I think
[01:40:22.880 --> 01:40:29.600]   it's about hypersegmentation. And the world is such a big place. That even if you're... That's
[01:40:29.600 --> 01:40:35.840]   coop. I love coop. Even if you're 1.2 million subscribers. Even if you're very narrow,
[01:40:35.840 --> 01:40:41.440]   like this crazy nerf, it's not even just nerf guns in general. It's this very specific kind of
[01:40:42.080 --> 01:40:47.200]   nerf. You can have a million and a quarter followers and have an outsized voice.
[01:40:47.200 --> 01:40:54.960]   I think that some of those subgroups do lend themselves more towards these extremist views.
[01:40:54.960 --> 01:41:00.480]   And that's where I think it gets into the algorithm because I've seen this in gamer culture. I love
[01:41:00.480 --> 01:41:08.240]   Japanese RPGs. That is a genre that doesn't always treat women super well. And some of the people
[01:41:08.240 --> 01:41:14.320]   covering that have comments and attitudes towards women. And then suddenly I find myself being offered
[01:41:14.320 --> 01:41:23.120]   these fringe channel personalities over here. And I could very easily see someone kind of falling
[01:41:23.120 --> 01:41:28.880]   into that rabbit hole. So I think it's less about the celebrity and more about the hypersegmentation
[01:41:28.880 --> 01:41:34.960]   and the culture of the kind of blooms around that. Yeah. Well, it's both. There is an intimacy.
[01:41:34.960 --> 01:41:40.160]   You know, Coop, and you feel a relationship with Coop much more so than you would if he were on
[01:41:40.160 --> 01:41:45.600]   Channel 9. Right. I mean, definitely. He's in your, there's something different about by the way,
[01:41:45.600 --> 01:41:51.600]   this video, which came out three years ago, has 5.3 million views and is monetized very simply
[01:41:51.600 --> 01:41:57.760]   through an Amazon affiliate link to rival blasters. I bet you he's made a lot of money on this.
[01:41:57.760 --> 01:42:01.440]   He's done very well. Are there in line? Was there a pre-roll ad for that video?
[01:42:02.160 --> 01:42:06.480]   You know, I'm on YouTube Red or whatever they call a premium. So I don't see ads.
[01:42:06.480 --> 01:42:11.600]   There probably is though, but there's probably an ad on it. But even more important to him,
[01:42:11.600 --> 01:42:17.680]   probably is the Amazon affiliate link. Although I noticed YouTube has just recently said,
[01:42:17.680 --> 01:42:24.320]   yeah, we're going to let these people work with advertisers in, you know, products directly.
[01:42:24.320 --> 01:42:28.000]   I think they want to get a cut of it because they're not getting a cut right now, the Amazon
[01:42:28.000 --> 01:42:32.720]   affiliate link. Well, I mean, YouTube a couple of years ago bought the main
[01:42:32.720 --> 01:42:40.240]   platform used by YouTubers to kind of do influencer partnerships, Famebit,
[01:42:40.240 --> 01:42:44.320]   which now you're kind of two main options. If you're a YouTube influencer who wants to
[01:42:44.320 --> 01:42:49.040]   make money in one of these ways, it's to do pre and post-roll ads to monetize your video,
[01:42:49.040 --> 01:42:56.080]   or you can partner with Famebit and whoever wants to, like different companies can offer you
[01:42:56.080 --> 01:43:00.560]   products to partner with him. So on your side, then YouTube gets a cut of whatever you make from
[01:43:00.560 --> 01:43:08.960]   that sale. Yeah. Brianna, do you have a nemesis? I do. I have two of them. My husband has one,
[01:43:08.960 --> 01:43:15.040]   and I have one. And I would tell you, it's a good way to learning to a good marriage. Look at this
[01:43:15.040 --> 01:43:21.200]   cut. This is a secret to a good marriage. This thing. Oh my God. How many? Oh, is that?
[01:43:21.200 --> 01:43:25.760]   This is outdated at this point. Oh, yeah. Like a lot of it. Yeah. It's like a lot of. It's about
[01:43:25.760 --> 01:43:31.360]   three rounds a second. The modern one shall fire about 10 rounds a second. Is that ping-pong balls?
[01:43:31.360 --> 01:43:37.760]   What are you shooting at? Little foam balls. Foam balls. Yep. This is not your grandpa's
[01:43:37.760 --> 01:43:42.080]   nurse. I shoot a lot of balls out of there. It looks like a lot of ball. Have you got a caliber?
[01:43:42.080 --> 01:43:48.800]   I have not. No. My son built a caliber. I got a kit for his birthday. So,
[01:43:49.440 --> 01:43:52.640]   does he shoot you with that? Yeah. It's quite painful.
[01:43:52.640 --> 01:44:00.720]   They have a whole 3D printer culture that's that sprung up out of Nerf guns. So,
[01:44:00.720 --> 01:44:07.840]   you will get additional hoppers to it and flywheels and lipo batteries. It's a fastening subculture.
[01:44:07.840 --> 01:44:17.040]   Is it a Nerf, this caliber? Yes. It's a custom built Nerf. It's like a,
[01:44:18.000 --> 01:44:25.520]   it's basically like a rail gun. Okay. Now I want to get into this. Oh my gosh.
[01:44:25.520 --> 01:44:27.840]   Is it have to be pink? No.
[01:44:27.840 --> 01:44:38.560]   This poor guy has 83 subscribers and 488. What is he doing wrong? A little consultation here.
[01:44:38.560 --> 01:44:47.040]   Leah, next time I come to your studio, I'm going to bring my Prometheus. I'm going to bring my
[01:44:47.040 --> 01:44:50.240]   Percees. We'll just have a whole battle in your studio. It'll be great.
[01:44:50.240 --> 01:44:54.240]   Where do you get a caliber and kit carsten?
[01:44:54.240 --> 01:45:01.440]   Hold on. I'm trying to find it. Yeah. Say caliber and kit carsten three times fast.
[01:45:01.440 --> 01:45:06.160]   Yeah. He'll appear. Watch out. He'll steal your, by the way. He'll steal your Nerf.
[01:45:06.160 --> 01:45:12.000]   Mine. I got mine from Captain's Slug on Etsy. If you show my...
[01:45:12.640 --> 01:45:19.200]   We do live in a very odd world where these little tiny niches can completely thrive.
[01:45:19.200 --> 01:45:25.040]   We're Captain's Slug is having 10,179 sales. Yeah. Exactly.
[01:45:25.040 --> 01:45:29.600]   Captain's Slug is low tier. Like you want to get high tier. You talk to out of darts.
[01:45:29.600 --> 01:45:33.840]   But I don't think it's a bad thing. I think this is a great thing, right? Yeah.
[01:45:33.840 --> 01:45:38.240]   Yeah. These are people that have to really printer factories in their home and they run the
[01:45:38.240 --> 01:45:45.280]   debt of a handful of platinum artists. You have thousands of gold artists, right?
[01:45:45.280 --> 01:45:51.760]   Instead of a small number of people getting filthy rich, you have a number... Well, we still have that.
[01:45:51.760 --> 01:45:57.440]   Hey, here's some good news. The music industry,
[01:45:57.440 --> 01:46:05.680]   revenues actually went up 13% last year to the highest they've been since 2006,
[01:46:05.680 --> 01:46:12.880]   11 billion dollars. And why? Music streaming. This is the thing that the music industry was
[01:46:12.880 --> 01:46:20.880]   decrying a few years ago. Oh, no. Spotify is going to kill our business. No. It's been very good. In fact,
[01:46:20.880 --> 01:46:26.800]   senior vice president of research at the RIAA, Josh Friedlander, says the music industry today is
[01:46:26.800 --> 01:46:32.320]   healthier than it has been in more than a decade. Revenue from streaming services are more than
[01:46:32.320 --> 01:46:38.720]   offsetting decreases in physical sales and digital downloads. It's hard to overstake the impact
[01:46:38.720 --> 01:46:43.680]   streaming music has had on the music industry. Well, I guess, yeah, there's also to consider
[01:46:43.680 --> 01:46:48.960]   that people are less likely to pirate music now that you can just stream it. I always said this.
[01:46:48.960 --> 01:46:54.640]   It's about point of access. They pirate because it was hard and expensive to get. But now you pay
[01:46:54.640 --> 01:46:59.600]   five bucks a month or 10 bucks a month and you have 60 million songs. You don't need to pirate.
[01:46:59.600 --> 01:47:04.640]   And guess what? Everybody wins. What's also interesting is that somebody like little Naz X,
[01:47:04.640 --> 01:47:10.480]   who doesn't have a contract nobody ever heard of, could put something on SoundCloud or Billie Eilish
[01:47:10.480 --> 01:47:19.840]   and suddenly become a huge star. So it's not all bad. It's not all good. It's interesting. It's
[01:47:19.840 --> 01:47:26.240]   just it's a different world. And I think sometimes people of my generation, I'll say it. We boomers,
[01:47:26.240 --> 01:47:30.800]   look at this brave new world and we don't get it. It's so strange, it's so different. It looks so
[01:47:30.800 --> 01:47:36.080]   threatening that what we do is we say, well, they're creating terrorists. And really, it's much more
[01:47:36.080 --> 01:47:48.160]   complex than that. There's positives, right? Yeah. Okay. I would say that I've discovered at least
[01:47:48.720 --> 01:47:57.200]   25 new artists in the past two weeks, just from things that that Madam A has recommended to me.
[01:47:57.200 --> 01:48:01.920]   And then there's the Democratic Socialism, says simulator.
[01:48:01.920 --> 01:48:12.080]   This is a game. Windows, Linux, Mac, OS, and Android. No iOS, weirdly enough.
[01:48:12.080 --> 01:48:18.320]   The Democratic Socialism simulator lets you play as the first socialist president of the
[01:48:18.320 --> 01:48:22.800]   United States. Can you redistribute power and wealth while addressing the climate crisis?
[01:48:22.800 --> 01:48:29.440]   I don't have a update for coronavirus. Yeah. Oh, yeah. Get the SDLC. Yeah,
[01:48:29.440 --> 01:48:37.120]   to coronavirus DLC. Yeah. Yeah. I've thought so much. I want to do a game at one point called
[01:48:37.120 --> 01:48:43.680]   Women Politician Simulator. Oh, you should. You have to make everything.
[01:48:43.680 --> 01:48:50.080]   You have to be really good. Don't smile. You should smile. Yeah. You got to go take this off the
[01:48:50.080 --> 01:48:53.280]   record. You can't talk about it. Someone's going to steal your idea. That's really
[01:48:53.280 --> 01:48:57.280]   going to ask you about gender bias. Do you say anything? Do you not say anything? You're screwing
[01:48:57.280 --> 01:49:03.200]   either way. You can't win. Yes. It's the game you can't win. Well, it's about how long you can
[01:49:03.200 --> 01:49:08.560]   survive. Oh, that's right. You will you will be booted out. A 70 year old white man will take
[01:49:08.560 --> 01:49:15.600]   your place. But how long can you survive? Yep. And you know, who knew that Tulsi Gabbert would
[01:49:15.600 --> 01:49:22.640]   be the cockroach of the Democratic primary? You just stay under the under the radar.
[01:49:22.640 --> 01:49:33.280]   A lot on the crawl space. This is wild. Did you see this $360,000
[01:49:34.800 --> 01:49:43.040]   for the Nintendo PlayStation? Yes. It never came to market. Is that right? I don't know
[01:49:43.040 --> 01:49:47.680]   anything about this. Oh, okay. Let me explain. Let Brianna explain this. Yeah, Brianna probably
[01:49:47.680 --> 01:49:51.680]   knows something about it. I mean, I could tell you all about it. Tell us all about it, Brianna.
[01:49:51.680 --> 01:49:56.400]   Okay. Okay. So, um, he stole my, uh, he stole my toilet. You better talk.
[01:49:56.400 --> 01:50:04.080]   There's an alternate history where the Sony PlayStation never came out and Nintendo dominated
[01:50:04.080 --> 01:50:11.040]   the optical drive space. So, uh, after the Super Nintendo era, Sony was working with a partnership
[01:50:11.040 --> 01:50:16.720]   with Nintendo to put out a new type of system based with optical media to get around the, uh,
[01:50:16.720 --> 01:50:22.080]   the low storage space. Maybe you young people don't remember, but in the old days, we didn't have
[01:50:22.080 --> 01:50:29.680]   CDs or DVDs for games. We had cartridges and you'd blow in it and you put it in. And that was
[01:50:29.680 --> 01:50:35.280]   how you played on an NES with the cartridge. It was very memory limited or very, yeah,
[01:50:35.280 --> 01:50:39.040]   very games are very primitive as a result. Very, very expensive to produce. Uh,
[01:50:39.040 --> 01:50:44.720]   they're a live famous cartridge, uh, shortages because of that. So anyway, long story short,
[01:50:44.720 --> 01:50:50.720]   Nintendo ended up going with the N64 with the partnership with Silicon Graphics. And then Sony
[01:50:50.720 --> 01:50:57.600]   had this technology with the optical drive ended up, um, bringing a whole marketing team just as
[01:50:57.600 --> 01:51:03.120]   Sega was imploding Blake, uh, Blake, uh, Blake Jay Harris did a great book about this called
[01:51:03.120 --> 01:51:08.320]   console wars. Oh, I love that book. I love that book. It's amazing. So this is, they swooped in
[01:51:08.320 --> 01:51:16.800]   and this particular device is the, it's like a relic of this lost history because if Nintendo
[01:51:16.800 --> 01:51:24.000]   had gone ahead, Sony would not be as dominant today as they are. A lot of people feel, uh, you know,
[01:51:24.000 --> 01:51:29.280]   Palmer Lucky were friends on Facebook. He was bidding like crazy on this, trying to get it.
[01:51:29.280 --> 01:51:35.280]   So I was rooting for him, uh, but ended up this guy got it for a 360. Uh, he's going to put in a
[01:51:35.280 --> 01:51:40.880]   museum. A lot of people expected this to go for like three quarters of a million dollars. So this
[01:51:40.880 --> 01:51:46.720]   is actually low compared to I blame Palmer Lucky for not having any guts. He could have, he's got
[01:51:46.720 --> 01:51:53.680]   the money. If Nintendo had not gone forward with this, had gone, had gone forward with this design,
[01:51:53.680 --> 01:51:59.280]   there would be no PlayStation. This is, this is why the PlayStation exists. It's labeled
[01:51:59.280 --> 01:52:05.120]   Sony PlayStation. It was, it was, it was, well, see, there's a Sony label on it. It is the Nintendo
[01:52:05.120 --> 01:52:09.760]   PlayStation, but look, it says Sony, Sony, but this is a prototype. Maybe the production would
[01:52:09.760 --> 01:52:18.160]   not have been labeled that way. Uh, it was found inside a box of stuff once owned by former Sony
[01:52:18.160 --> 01:52:25.600]   Entertainment CEO Olaf Olafson. The company that he was working at went bankrupt. Uh, this stuff
[01:52:25.600 --> 01:52:32.720]   was auctioned off. Uh, a guy named Terry Debold acquired it in the auction. He's been taking it
[01:52:32.720 --> 01:52:39.040]   around to conventions for years. He finally decided to sell it at auction. This prototype is never
[01:52:39.040 --> 01:52:46.240]   before been offered. So it's historic, but it's not a product that ever was made. Nintendo
[01:52:46.240 --> 01:52:55.120]   PlayStation, $360,000. That's, that's pretty wild, isn't it? Yeah. What year was that?
[01:52:55.120 --> 01:53:03.280]   Do we know? 96, 95. Yeah. No, you know, it's easy to say, you know, the revisionist history,
[01:53:03.280 --> 01:53:09.120]   and I bet you there's already an Amazon pilot being made, but uh, with Nazis,
[01:53:09.120 --> 01:53:12.800]   probably with Nazis, certainly with Nazis, because it's no good if there's no Nazi,
[01:53:12.800 --> 01:53:19.680]   Nazis are the new vampires, by the way. Did you know that? Yeah. Uh, but there's no guarantee we've
[01:53:19.680 --> 01:53:24.960]   seen a lot of, you know, oh, this would have been the next big thing. Go by the wayside. I
[01:53:24.960 --> 01:53:31.440]   remember from that era. Tons of Atari Lynx, the 3DO. Remember all these? There were a lot of great
[01:53:31.440 --> 01:53:38.160]   game. The 3DO was awesome. Well, it didn't have the software to, to last one. It's a pretty good
[01:53:38.160 --> 01:53:44.000]   game. Yeah. Yeah. Uh, I loved playing it, but it didn't, it never... It was just too expensive.
[01:53:44.000 --> 01:53:48.560]   Maybe that was it. Yep. They're about to re-release the PC engine, also known as the
[01:53:48.560 --> 01:53:54.240]   TurboGrafx-16. That's getting a Super Nintendo style mini cartridge that's coming out. I'm really
[01:53:54.240 --> 01:54:01.040]   excited about that because I could never afford one of those. Yeah. Uh, you all, you all survived
[01:54:01.040 --> 01:54:07.680]   daylight saving time. You showed up an hour early, but you were all here. Um... There were a lot of
[01:54:07.680 --> 01:54:13.360]   all caps emails sent out about this. They were there. They were. They were. Thank you, Karsten.
[01:54:13.360 --> 01:54:18.480]   I'm gonna, I'm gonna rat on Karsten and let you know, he said, what was it? Three all caps emails
[01:54:18.480 --> 01:54:23.040]   warning us about daylight saving stuff. I think he'd had a little too much of that coffee silent.
[01:54:23.040 --> 01:54:29.920]   I can either... It worked. I'm nor deny. But let me tell you something. This is bad.
[01:54:29.920 --> 01:54:37.520]   Spring daylight saving time transition acutely increases fatal traffic accidents. Each year,
[01:54:37.920 --> 01:54:45.120]   on the Monday following by six percent. In other words, 28 lives could be prevented yearly if they
[01:54:45.120 --> 01:54:53.040]   abandoned daylight saving time. Great. Heart attacks go up. Lots of problems associated with
[01:54:53.040 --> 01:55:00.000]   daylight saving time. This is from current biology, was published a few days ago. A chronological
[01:55:00.000 --> 01:55:05.040]   evaluation of the acute effects of daylight saving time on traffic accident risk.
[01:55:05.040 --> 01:55:12.560]   I feel very strongly we need to get rid of it. Marco Rubio was tweeting about this yesterday,
[01:55:12.560 --> 01:55:16.880]   saying he wants to get rid of it. If you get elected, make that promise to me. Absolutely. I
[01:55:16.880 --> 01:55:22.880]   swear it is the worst. I hate it and it needs to go. You know how bad it is? I think if President
[01:55:22.880 --> 01:55:28.480]   Trump were able to reverse this, I might even, he might even get my vote. Well, forget all the rest
[01:55:28.480 --> 01:55:34.640]   of it. He fixed daylight saving time. But the problem... I don't want to get rid of daylight saving time.
[01:55:34.640 --> 01:55:38.560]   I want to make that the... Which would you make the standard? Daylight saving or standard?
[01:55:38.560 --> 01:55:41.600]   The standard time should be the standard. This should be the standard. What we are right now.
[01:55:41.600 --> 01:55:46.160]   Yeah. What if there was just one universal time like TMT?
[01:55:46.160 --> 01:55:52.880]   I mentioned that I hate time zones. They ruin my life daily. All of my... Most of my office works
[01:55:52.880 --> 01:55:57.920]   in San Francisco. So I'm constantly calculating what time it is here versus there. And then I'll be
[01:55:57.920 --> 01:56:03.200]   calling someone because my whole job is just to call people. And I'm like, God, what time is it?
[01:56:03.200 --> 01:56:09.280]   Half of my day is spent googling. What time is it in city name here? I hate it. Get rid of it.
[01:56:09.280 --> 01:56:17.760]   I would just get used to waking up at 10 or three or whatever time we agree... As a world agreed to.
[01:56:17.760 --> 01:56:22.880]   And it would just be in New York you wake up at three. And it's kind of radical.
[01:56:23.520 --> 01:56:30.160]   But it's an interesting idea. People would say, I am not going to get up at all 200.
[01:56:30.160 --> 01:56:31.200]   It's a train industrial complex.
[01:56:31.200 --> 01:56:33.440]   Yeah. I don't know.
[01:56:33.440 --> 01:56:37.040]   I guess we could just start using GMT and go from there.
[01:56:37.040 --> 01:56:37.680]   I'm going to do it.
[01:56:37.680 --> 01:56:40.160]   I'm going to just start using GMT.
[01:56:40.160 --> 01:56:47.440]   I'm going to use universal coordinated time from now on. It is 2300 UTC.
[01:56:50.480 --> 01:56:56.400]   I think that's a good idea. I'm going to start it right now. There should be a setting on every
[01:56:56.400 --> 01:57:01.360]   digital watch. You could just say, I'm just going to use UTC. It probably is. I want to make a...
[01:57:01.360 --> 01:57:04.880]   That's a good idea. Let me see in my iPhone if I can make it UTC.
[01:57:04.880 --> 01:57:07.600]   Just change my...
[01:57:07.600 --> 01:57:09.920]   Leo is how many hours late for every...
[01:57:09.920 --> 01:57:14.320]   It's not my fault. I'm not UTC. It's not my fault.
[01:57:14.320 --> 01:57:19.680]   I'm doing the right thing. I'm changing the world.
[01:57:20.400 --> 01:57:27.840]   Where would I change that in general probably? Date and time. Time zone. There it is.
[01:57:27.840 --> 01:57:37.760]   My time zone is now UTC. Yeah. There you go. It's 11.33 pm. No, no, no. I want 24-hour time.
[01:57:37.760 --> 01:57:41.200]   At least we're going to do that. It's 23.33.
[01:57:41.200 --> 01:57:45.680]   So that's GMT, right? That's the same as...
[01:57:45.680 --> 01:57:48.640]   Same as GMT. We don't say GMT anymore, Seth.
[01:57:48.640 --> 01:57:53.360]   Greenwich mean time. That's very English-centric.
[01:57:53.360 --> 01:57:58.960]   Anglo-centric. By the way, universal UTC is an abbreviation for nothing.
[01:57:58.960 --> 01:58:03.040]   There's no language in the world that it would actually be UTC.
[01:58:03.040 --> 01:58:06.960]   No. It's not French. It's not...
[01:58:06.960 --> 01:58:08.640]   It's not even a time code?
[01:58:08.640 --> 01:58:14.000]   No. Look it up on Wikipedia. They explain the whole thing. It's actually made up.
[01:58:14.000 --> 01:58:19.760]   It's a made up abbreviation because nobody could agree. It stands for coordinated universal time,
[01:58:19.760 --> 01:58:23.120]   but nobody could agree on what the abbreviation would be.
[01:58:23.120 --> 01:58:27.360]   So it's universal time coordinated?
[01:58:27.360 --> 01:58:28.960]   Yeah, but that's no language in the...
[01:58:28.960 --> 01:58:32.320]   The French... Okay.
[01:58:32.320 --> 01:58:39.040]   The official abbreviation of UTC and the official English name of coordinated universal time cut
[01:58:39.040 --> 01:58:42.960]   along with the French equivalent were not adopted until 1967.
[01:58:42.960 --> 01:58:51.360]   But it's not an abbreviation. There's no language where UTC is actually the abbreviation.
[01:58:51.360 --> 01:58:54.640]   The official abbreviation for coordinated universal time is UTC.
[01:58:54.640 --> 01:59:00.320]   The abbreviation rose from a desire by the ITU and the international astronomical union
[01:59:00.320 --> 01:59:04.640]   to use the same abbreviation in all languages. English speakers proposed cut.
[01:59:04.640 --> 01:59:09.600]   French speakers proposed tuck. Faut aun de veser called "donne."
[01:59:10.240 --> 01:59:14.720]   The compromise that emerged was "utte" but it's not...
[01:59:14.720 --> 01:59:16.080]   Something that is good for not.
[01:59:16.080 --> 01:59:19.440]   Good for nobody. That's compromising a nutshell.
[01:59:19.440 --> 01:59:22.240]   If nobody's happy, it's a good compromise.
[01:59:22.240 --> 01:59:28.240]   And I guess that's a good segue into one time for everybody.
[01:59:28.240 --> 01:59:32.480]   It's going to be crappy for a lot of people for a little bit, but overall it's great.
[01:59:32.480 --> 01:59:36.400]   It's basically the Esperanto of times.
[01:59:36.400 --> 01:59:36.880]   Exactly.
[01:59:36.880 --> 01:59:41.200]   A language no one speaks, no one likes, but at least it's universal.
[01:59:41.200 --> 01:59:42.400]   Right.
[01:59:42.400 --> 01:59:43.280]   I'm into it.
[01:59:43.280 --> 01:59:43.840]   I like it.
[01:59:43.840 --> 01:59:46.080]   I just sit on the watch.
[01:59:46.080 --> 01:59:47.920]   Everything I have is now UTC.
[01:59:47.920 --> 01:59:50.720]   Let's see how that works out.
[01:59:50.720 --> 01:59:55.840]   I don't think my wife's going to like it when I said all the clocks to UTC.
[01:59:55.840 --> 02:00:03.520]   Yeah, set that, John. Every clock is now it's going to be set to UTC.
[02:00:03.520 --> 02:00:06.480]   It's all because of you, Seth Winetrap. I blame you.
[02:00:07.280 --> 02:00:08.080]   All right.
[02:00:08.080 --> 02:00:12.640]   Our show today brought to you by Wasabi, not the green stuff on your sushi.
[02:00:12.640 --> 02:00:12.880]   No.
[02:00:12.880 --> 02:00:14.320]   But it is hot.
[02:00:14.320 --> 02:00:15.680]   It's hot cloud storage.
[02:00:15.680 --> 02:00:17.200]   W-A-S-A-B-I.
[02:00:17.200 --> 02:00:21.440]   The perfect solution for anybody who's moving to the cloud.
[02:00:21.440 --> 02:00:24.960]   If you're a managed service provider, you're going to love this because you can earn more
[02:00:24.960 --> 02:00:26.000]   while charging less.
[02:00:26.000 --> 02:00:31.120]   Yes, Wasabi's 80% less expensive than Amazon S3.
[02:00:31.120 --> 02:00:34.400]   And it's a lot cheaper than on-prem storage.
[02:00:34.400 --> 02:00:37.200]   In fact, typically you can store data in Wasabi's cloud
[02:00:37.200 --> 02:00:41.280]   for less than just the annual cost of the maintenance fees on on-prem storage.
[02:00:41.280 --> 02:00:42.720]   Let alone the storage itself.
[02:00:42.720 --> 02:00:48.800]   Wasabi's disruptive price performance model makes buying cloud storage a natural addition.
[02:00:48.800 --> 02:00:51.200]   I talk to more and more people all the time are using Wasabi.
[02:00:51.200 --> 02:00:54.240]   For a lot of reasons, it's not just less expensive.
[02:00:54.240 --> 02:00:54.800]   It's better.
[02:00:54.800 --> 02:00:56.640]   11 nines of durability.
[02:00:56.640 --> 02:01:00.640]   They have active integrity checking.
[02:01:00.640 --> 02:01:03.760]   Every object stored in your Wasabi cloud is checked for integrity.
[02:01:03.760 --> 02:01:04.880]   Every 90 days.
[02:01:04.880 --> 02:01:12.400]   Because Wasabi uses multiple tier four data centers that are highly secure and fully redundant.
[02:01:12.400 --> 02:01:17.920]   If one bit goes south during that integrity check and they pull a good version of the file
[02:01:17.920 --> 02:01:21.440]   from another one of the data centers, you never lose one single bit.
[02:01:21.440 --> 02:01:28.480]   Access control mechanisms like bucket policies and ACLs can be used to protect your data from
[02:01:29.280 --> 02:01:34.320]   employees. Here's another nice feature that will protect your data from ransomware.
[02:01:34.320 --> 02:01:37.840]   You can designate your data immutable.
[02:01:37.840 --> 02:01:39.280]   It cannot be erased.
[02:01:39.280 --> 02:01:40.640]   It cannot be altered.
[02:01:40.640 --> 02:01:42.160]   It cannot be hacked.
[02:01:42.160 --> 02:01:44.720]   And no fumble finger employee can delete it.
[02:01:44.720 --> 02:01:48.560]   Hippo compliant, FINRA compliant, CJIS compliant.
[02:01:48.560 --> 02:01:50.560]   I should really start with all the good stuff.
[02:01:50.560 --> 02:01:53.520]   This is the best cloud storage.
[02:01:53.520 --> 02:01:55.680]   And then I should mention, oh, and by the way,
[02:01:57.120 --> 02:02:03.440]   one fifth the cost of Amazon S3 and no fees for egress that saves you money.
[02:02:03.440 --> 02:02:05.040]   It's the same API as Amazon's S3.
[02:02:05.040 --> 02:02:08.320]   So you already know how to use it, but they don't charge for API requests,
[02:02:08.320 --> 02:02:09.840]   no complex storage tiers.
[02:02:09.840 --> 02:02:13.840]   In every way, this is superior to any other cloud you've ever seen.
[02:02:13.840 --> 02:02:18.400]   But of course, it's an uphill battle because everybody says, well, I, you know,
[02:02:18.400 --> 02:02:19.680]   I just use AWS.
[02:02:19.680 --> 02:02:21.520]   No, you need to check out Wasabi.
[02:02:21.520 --> 02:02:23.680]   Calculate the savings for yourself.
[02:02:23.680 --> 02:02:24.960]   You can do it right now.
[02:02:24.960 --> 02:02:29.440]   In fact, a free unlimited trial for you at wasabi.com.
[02:02:29.440 --> 02:02:30.640]   Use the offer code TWIT.
[02:02:30.640 --> 02:02:32.640]   Unlimited storage.
[02:02:32.640 --> 02:02:33.920]   You just bang on that thing.
[02:02:33.920 --> 02:02:40.240]   Free trial one month unlimited use the offer code TWIT wasabi is amazing.
[02:02:40.240 --> 02:02:42.320]   And I, and I have to say, I'm a little bit of a,
[02:02:42.320 --> 02:02:45.760]   I'm a little biased because it was started by one of my good friends, David Friend.
[02:02:45.760 --> 02:02:49.040]   And he's just done an amazing job with this.
[02:02:49.040 --> 02:02:50.480]   This is such a great product.
[02:02:51.040 --> 02:02:54.720]   More and more people are discovering Wasabi.
[02:02:54.720 --> 02:02:59.840]   Shouldn't you wasabi.com use the offer code TWIT so they know you heard it here.
[02:02:59.840 --> 02:03:01.440]   It's now.
[02:03:01.440 --> 02:03:07.360]   I don't know.
[02:03:07.360 --> 02:03:07.760]   Midnight.
[02:03:07.760 --> 02:03:10.640]   Yeah, it's 20, 2338.
[02:03:10.640 --> 02:03:13.680]   That means it's almost midnight, I think.
[02:03:13.680 --> 02:03:18.480]   You know, if I do it that way, then that way I will, I won't just look at it and go.
[02:03:18.480 --> 02:03:20.320]   It's, it's, it's, it's midnight.
[02:03:20.320 --> 02:03:22.080]   I'll know it's 2338 UTC.
[02:03:22.080 --> 02:03:25.760]   Brilliant. Brilliant.
[02:03:25.760 --> 02:03:29.440]   Setti at home is over.
[02:03:29.440 --> 02:03:31.600]   What?
[02:03:31.600 --> 02:03:35.520]   Now you can protein forward it home.
[02:03:35.520 --> 02:03:37.440]   Yeah, I tried that.
[02:03:37.440 --> 02:03:38.800]   My fans never turned off.
[02:03:38.800 --> 02:03:40.400]   So I said not to do that.
[02:03:40.400 --> 02:03:44.240]   I thought, well, yeah, I'm going to help search for the cure to the coronavirus,
[02:03:44.240 --> 02:03:46.080]   but the fans never turned off.
[02:03:47.680 --> 02:03:50.640]   This is something that started back in the 90s.
[02:03:50.640 --> 02:03:53.840]   The search for extraterrestrial intelligence.
[02:03:53.840 --> 02:03:55.760]   Setti at home.
[02:03:55.760 --> 02:03:58.160]   The idea was there are lots of people with computers.
[02:03:58.160 --> 02:04:01.440]   You could put a screensaver or a background program on your computer,
[02:04:01.440 --> 02:04:03.280]   and it'll just steal a few cycles.
[02:04:03.280 --> 02:04:08.880]   And it'll look through the vast amounts of data collected by radio telescopes looking for
[02:04:08.880 --> 02:04:11.840]   intelligence signals in there.
[02:04:11.840 --> 02:04:16.320]   On Tuesday, researchers at the Berkeley Setti Research Center announced,
[02:04:17.200 --> 02:04:17.760]   that's it.
[02:04:17.760 --> 02:04:18.400]   It's over.
[02:04:18.400 --> 02:04:22.240]   They're going to stop distributing Setti at home at the end of the month.
[02:04:22.240 --> 02:04:24.720]   Did they find anything?
[02:04:24.720 --> 02:04:26.240]   No.
[02:04:26.240 --> 02:04:34.000]   So far, the researchers at Berkeley have only been able to analyze small portions
[02:04:34.000 --> 02:04:38.800]   of the Setti at home data that can stand too much.
[02:04:38.800 --> 02:04:40.640]   There's two.
[02:04:40.640 --> 02:04:43.840]   Stop already.
[02:04:43.840 --> 02:04:45.840]   So it was a great success, I guess.
[02:04:46.800 --> 02:04:49.680]   I used that on all my computers for years.
[02:04:49.680 --> 02:04:50.080]   I did too.
[02:04:50.080 --> 02:04:50.640]   Yeah.
[02:04:50.640 --> 02:04:51.440]   Yeah.
[02:04:51.440 --> 02:04:58.480]   The Arocibo radio telescope in Puerto Rico collects terabytes of data all the time.
[02:04:58.480 --> 02:05:05.200]   At its launch, within months of launch, coronavirus wired more than 2.6 million people
[02:05:05.200 --> 02:05:08.880]   in 226 countries were volunteering their computers.
[02:05:08.880 --> 02:05:14.560]   25 trillion calculations a second, more powerful than the best supercomputer in the world
[02:05:15.040 --> 02:05:15.840]   at the time.
[02:05:15.840 --> 02:05:19.760]   So do you do folding at home, Seth?
[02:05:19.760 --> 02:05:23.920]   No, I did Bitcoin at home for a little bit, but...
[02:05:23.920 --> 02:05:25.520]   Did you make any money?
[02:05:25.520 --> 02:05:29.120]   No.
[02:05:29.120 --> 02:05:33.760]   You can make a couple pennies, but you need to really get the rigs going if you want to
[02:05:33.760 --> 02:05:34.640]   do that seriously.
[02:05:34.640 --> 02:05:37.920]   And it's an energy waster, so not my cup of tea.
[02:05:37.920 --> 02:05:42.400]   Where did I just saw, I think it was in the US,
[02:05:43.360 --> 02:05:49.600]   a New York, I guess it's a New York power plant, upper New York state, New York.
[02:05:49.600 --> 02:05:55.840]   They put the Bitcoin miners behind the paywall because they're generating their own
[02:05:55.840 --> 02:05:56.560]   electricity.
[02:05:56.560 --> 02:06:03.120]   So basically there's no charge and they say they average 5.5 bitcoins every day.
[02:06:03.120 --> 02:06:05.760]   That's about 50 grand at current prices.
[02:06:06.800 --> 02:06:14.320]   7,000 miners powered, it's on site behind the meter as they say.
[02:06:14.320 --> 02:06:20.480]   So as a New Yorker, this is upsetting to me for a couple of reasons.
[02:06:20.480 --> 02:06:24.000]   One, this is a peaker plant, so it's not terribly efficient.
[02:06:24.000 --> 02:06:31.600]   It exists because of peak usage in the summer months when an air conditioning comes on.
[02:06:31.600 --> 02:06:35.040]   So it only turns on theoretically when those months happen.
[02:06:35.040 --> 02:06:36.640]   Now it's running all the time.
[02:06:36.640 --> 02:06:39.760]   Now it's running all the time spewing carbon into the air.
[02:06:39.760 --> 02:06:43.120]   It's running on natural gas, so it's using up fossil fuels.
[02:06:43.120 --> 02:06:50.480]   Yeah, it's a horrible thing and Cuomo, our governor, has been talking about zeros.
[02:06:50.480 --> 02:06:54.560]   Yeah, zero emissions.
[02:06:54.560 --> 02:07:00.960]   And to have this like inside his state is kind of a joke.
[02:07:02.160 --> 02:07:06.480]   So I'm pretty upset about that and I've actually asked for a luck track.
[02:07:06.480 --> 02:07:08.960]   I've asked them for comment on it, but it's the weekend.
[02:07:08.960 --> 02:07:11.200]   So we won't hear about it till tomorrow.
[02:07:11.200 --> 02:07:18.480]   Seth, I think I remember reading that there's so much power consumed by Bitcoin mining.
[02:07:18.480 --> 02:07:23.040]   It offsets every single solar installation we've put in globally.
[02:07:23.040 --> 02:07:24.720]   That wouldn't surprise me.
[02:07:24.720 --> 02:07:29.200]   It's quite frustrating knowing that.
[02:07:29.200 --> 02:07:30.080]   Pointlessly.
[02:07:30.080 --> 02:07:30.960]   Pointlessly.
[02:07:30.960 --> 02:07:31.600]   We don't.
[02:07:31.600 --> 02:07:33.760]   Yeah, I agree.
[02:07:33.760 --> 02:07:38.480]   It would be nice if you could somehow game solar.
[02:07:38.480 --> 02:07:46.800]   Instead of buying a electric using rig, you buy a solar panel and an inverter
[02:07:46.800 --> 02:07:49.840]   and get money by putting energy into the grid.
[02:07:49.840 --> 02:07:54.880]   Maybe that's what I should be doing right now instead of...
[02:07:57.520 --> 02:08:05.040]   Why not just make real value instead of just sucking value out and then having this game that
[02:08:05.040 --> 02:08:08.320]   everybody's playing and evaluating?
[02:08:08.320 --> 02:08:15.040]   I wonder how much power was wasted by SETI at home running for 20 years trying to find
[02:08:15.040 --> 02:08:16.240]   life in the universe.
[02:08:16.240 --> 02:08:17.520]   Yeah, not in the universe.
[02:08:17.520 --> 02:08:18.800]   Non-trivial amount.
[02:08:18.800 --> 02:08:19.760]   Absolutely.
[02:08:19.760 --> 02:08:22.880]   I had every computer in my house running that all of the time.
[02:08:22.880 --> 02:08:23.440]   I did.
[02:08:24.960 --> 02:08:29.200]   Yeah, I do have to say there's a huge contingent...
[02:08:29.200 --> 02:08:31.600]   MIT is here in Massachusetts.
[02:08:31.600 --> 02:08:36.080]   We had a huge Bitcoin convention there just this weekend.
[02:08:36.080 --> 02:08:39.760]   I don't know.
[02:08:39.760 --> 02:08:46.160]   Not all cryptocurrency is as energy-consumptive as Bitcoin itself is.
[02:08:46.160 --> 02:08:52.240]   I do sometimes get frustrated with some of the stereotypes that get thrown around with people
[02:08:52.240 --> 02:08:56.800]   that are in the cryptocurrency because there are so many legitimate uses of blockchain.
[02:08:56.800 --> 02:09:01.120]   But this is obviously the case you're talking about, Seth.
[02:09:01.120 --> 02:09:02.640]   It's indefensible.
[02:09:02.640 --> 02:09:09.200]   So it turns out the coronavirus, the way it gets into you...
[02:09:09.200 --> 02:09:10.720]   Yeah, let's get back to the coronavirus.
[02:09:10.720 --> 02:09:11.440]   It's much more fun.
[02:09:11.440 --> 02:09:15.120]   It has a little spike on the protein, right?
[02:09:15.120 --> 02:09:18.960]   Which comes up to the cell, jams it into the cell and takes over the cell.
[02:09:20.240 --> 02:09:27.200]   Scientists are trying to design a protein that could bind to the coronavirus's spike,
[02:09:27.200 --> 02:09:32.960]   basically blunting it so that it can't interact with human cells.
[02:09:32.960 --> 02:09:34.320]   No infection.
[02:09:34.320 --> 02:09:35.280]   Would you like to help?
[02:09:35.280 --> 02:09:38.080]   This is a site folded.
[02:09:38.080 --> 02:09:39.520]   Solve puzzles for science.
[02:09:39.520 --> 02:09:41.040]   This isn't folding at home.
[02:09:41.040 --> 02:09:44.960]   This is an actual game that you could try.
[02:09:44.960 --> 02:09:52.160]   It's a puzzle 1805B that you could try to design your little...
[02:09:52.160 --> 02:09:56.640]   Well, at least you're having fun while you're doing it.
[02:09:56.640 --> 02:10:00.160]   I have to say, I'm married to someone that works in this field.
[02:10:00.160 --> 02:10:06.560]   The delivery mechanism of how drugs and infections, viruses, transmit, that's a huge part of it.
[02:10:06.560 --> 02:10:08.480]   It's not enough to just generate a cure.
[02:10:08.480 --> 02:10:10.800]   You've got to figure out how you're going to deliver it.
[02:10:10.800 --> 02:10:18.240]   The basic science of this, I would guess, is solid, but as far as getting to a human application from it,
[02:10:18.240 --> 02:10:20.320]   this would be a very small piece of the puzzle.
[02:10:20.320 --> 02:10:26.560]   But wouldn't it be cool if somebody fix, finds it, and then they can start making it, right?
[02:10:26.560 --> 02:10:29.920]   Well, how would you deliver it to mass people?
[02:10:29.920 --> 02:10:32.960]   How would you know it's not a part of the wider number of proteins?
[02:10:32.960 --> 02:10:38.240]   Okay, there's other things you have to solve, but at least you could do this, right?
[02:10:39.520 --> 02:10:41.280]   How do you know it's not toxic? I mean...
[02:10:41.280 --> 02:10:43.120]   That's true, I could kill you.
[02:10:43.120 --> 02:10:44.320]   Yeah.
[02:10:44.320 --> 02:10:47.520]   But it is available for free on Windows, Mac, and Linux, I just want to say.
[02:10:47.520 --> 02:10:52.720]   All right, let's wrap this puppy up.
[02:10:52.720 --> 02:10:54.080]   You guys are great.
[02:10:54.080 --> 02:10:56.480]   You survived the coronavirus show.
[02:10:56.480 --> 02:10:59.040]   Next week, we're on.
[02:10:59.040 --> 02:11:01.680]   Well, we can check in in two weeks and we'll let you know.
[02:11:01.680 --> 02:11:02.640]   It'll probably be another one.
[02:11:02.640 --> 02:11:03.120]   Yeah, right.
[02:11:03.120 --> 02:11:04.320]   You're all infected now.
[02:11:04.320 --> 02:11:07.280]   No, it's so great to have you on Paris.
[02:11:07.280 --> 02:11:08.320]   I just adore you.
[02:11:08.320 --> 02:11:08.880]   Thank you.
[02:11:08.880 --> 02:11:12.720]   I can't wait to see some of your ceramics and your neon...
[02:11:12.720 --> 02:11:13.600]   What's the neon sign?
[02:11:13.600 --> 02:11:14.400]   Check out my Twitter.
[02:11:14.400 --> 02:11:18.000]   I just posted a photo of the neon sign in my room.
[02:11:18.000 --> 02:11:21.520]   It's an abstract thing because it was the first neon sign I've ever done.
[02:11:21.520 --> 02:11:24.800]   And it's very difficult to bend glass in a way that forms words.
[02:11:24.800 --> 02:11:27.920]   So we just did abstract ones for the beginning.
[02:11:27.920 --> 02:11:28.880]   Where is it on your...
[02:11:28.880 --> 02:11:30.240]   Oh, it's a...
[02:11:30.240 --> 02:11:30.960]   There it is.
[02:11:30.960 --> 02:11:31.760]   Oh, neat.
[02:11:31.760 --> 02:11:33.040]   Oh, wow, look at that.
[02:11:33.040 --> 02:11:35.040]   Is the photo me blowing for glass?
[02:11:35.040 --> 02:11:36.560]   Yeah, that's beautiful.
[02:11:36.960 --> 02:11:38.800]   So you...
[02:11:38.800 --> 02:11:40.400]   Now, and then you seal both of that.
[02:11:40.400 --> 02:11:41.040]   You put...
[02:11:41.040 --> 02:11:42.160]   How do you get the gas in it?
[02:11:42.160 --> 02:11:50.880]   So we started with large tubes, which you have kind of like a phosphorus coating inside of
[02:11:50.880 --> 02:11:52.720]   in order to produce the violet color.
[02:11:52.720 --> 02:11:58.320]   And then kind of put it over this large wall of flame to bend it.
[02:11:58.320 --> 02:12:01.520]   And then what you see me doing in the left on that photo is attaching...
[02:12:01.520 --> 02:12:04.400]   It's called like a tubulator or something and a different type of cap,
[02:12:05.280 --> 02:12:09.040]   which you kind of have to put the metal together or the glass together,
[02:12:09.040 --> 02:12:10.560]   melt it together on those ends.
[02:12:10.560 --> 02:12:15.600]   And then the people at the neon sign and glasswork studio we were at
[02:12:15.600 --> 02:12:21.520]   put the mercury and different gas in using this kind of large machine they had.
[02:12:21.520 --> 02:12:25.920]   And then we hooked up the electronics to it and whatnot.
[02:12:25.920 --> 02:12:26.640]   And there you go.
[02:12:26.640 --> 02:12:28.000]   That's a photo of me who's...
[02:12:28.000 --> 02:12:29.360]   So cool.
[02:12:29.360 --> 02:12:30.400]   That's awesome.
[02:12:30.400 --> 02:12:32.400]   Oh my god, you rock.
[02:12:32.400 --> 02:12:34.080]   That is great.
[02:12:34.080 --> 02:12:35.120]   You are so crafty.
[02:12:35.120 --> 02:12:40.480]   Trying to do anything that will force me to not look at the internet for an hour.
[02:12:40.480 --> 02:12:40.960]   No kidding.
[02:12:40.960 --> 02:12:42.880]   I like the backward baseball cap too.
[02:12:42.880 --> 02:12:43.680]   That's a good look.
[02:12:43.680 --> 02:12:46.400]   Apparently I started off with it face forward, but you can have
[02:12:46.400 --> 02:12:49.520]   baseball caps on like that when you're around flying them through.
[02:12:49.520 --> 02:12:49.920]   I've got you on fire.
[02:12:49.920 --> 02:12:52.320]   No point to heat your eyes.
[02:12:52.320 --> 02:12:52.560]   Yeah.
[02:12:52.560 --> 02:12:54.640]   I noticed you also tucked in your shirt.
[02:12:54.640 --> 02:12:56.320]   Just you don't want that to catch a fire either.
[02:12:56.320 --> 02:12:57.520]   Truly.
[02:12:57.520 --> 02:13:01.920]   I mean, this is the only photo I posted from there because the other photos of me
[02:13:01.920 --> 02:13:03.760]   actually bending the glass, I was like...
[02:13:03.760 --> 02:13:09.120]   I was in a very protective crouched over stand because I was very afraid that I was great.
[02:13:09.120 --> 02:13:09.920]   Yeah.
[02:13:09.920 --> 02:13:12.160]   It feels like you should be wearing protective eyewear as well.
[02:13:12.160 --> 02:13:13.200]   I just want to say.
[02:13:13.200 --> 02:13:13.760]   Yeah.
[02:13:13.760 --> 02:13:15.840]   I mean, apparently my glasses cut it.
[02:13:15.840 --> 02:13:18.160]   I still also felt like I should be wearing protective paper.
[02:13:18.160 --> 02:13:21.040]   Is it neon like very toxic?
[02:13:21.040 --> 02:13:22.320]   Oh, it's so smirk.
[02:13:22.320 --> 02:13:23.280]   So I mean it has.
[02:13:23.280 --> 02:13:25.440]   It has two drops of murk...
[02:13:25.440 --> 02:13:26.320]   It's a Neurid.
[02:13:26.320 --> 02:13:27.280]   The Neons and the Nerip.
[02:13:27.280 --> 02:13:28.160]   But the...
[02:13:28.160 --> 02:13:29.760]   But the mercury in it.
[02:13:29.760 --> 02:13:30.240]   Yeah.
[02:13:30.240 --> 02:13:36.000]   But it's essentially the equivalent of like five thermometers worth.
[02:13:36.000 --> 02:13:39.600]   So it's not going to ruin your life if it breaks.
[02:13:39.600 --> 02:13:40.880]   You just...
[02:13:40.880 --> 02:13:41.600]   Wait a minute.
[02:13:41.600 --> 02:13:42.800]   That sounds like a lot.
[02:13:42.800 --> 02:13:46.320]   Oh, I can...
[02:13:46.320 --> 02:13:47.440]   I mean, it's not a...
[02:13:47.440 --> 02:13:50.000]   It's not a insignificant amount.
[02:13:50.000 --> 02:13:50.640]   But it's not...
[02:13:50.640 --> 02:13:50.880]   Yeah.
[02:13:50.880 --> 02:13:52.240]   Don't drink the neon sign.
[02:13:52.240 --> 02:13:53.840]   But if it breaks, you're not going to die.
[02:13:53.840 --> 02:13:56.640]   Mercury is only dangerous if you inhale it.
[02:13:56.640 --> 02:13:58.560]   I remember when I was a kid,
[02:13:59.200 --> 02:14:00.400]   going to the dentist.
[02:14:00.400 --> 02:14:01.520]   This is how old I am.
[02:14:01.520 --> 02:14:04.480]   And they still used mercury in fillings.
[02:14:04.480 --> 02:14:06.080]   And the dentist was playing with it saying,
[02:14:06.080 --> 02:14:06.960]   "Look, isn't this cool?
[02:14:06.960 --> 02:14:09.840]   Look, isn't this little little mercury cool?"
[02:14:09.840 --> 02:14:11.680]   And you're alive.
[02:14:11.680 --> 02:14:12.480]   I'm still alive.
[02:14:12.480 --> 02:14:15.440]   In fact, maybe that's why I didn't get coronavirus.
[02:14:15.440 --> 02:14:16.240]   Maybe I'm protected.
[02:14:16.240 --> 02:14:21.520]   Now this show is going to get banned on YouTube.
[02:14:21.520 --> 02:14:24.320]   Do not use mercury to save yourself.
[02:14:24.320 --> 02:14:28.000]   Seth, it's great to have you Electric.com.
[02:14:28.640 --> 02:14:31.600]   And 9 to 5 Google and 9 to 5 Mac.
[02:14:31.600 --> 02:14:34.320]   He's the publisher Seth Weintraub.
[02:14:34.320 --> 02:14:35.840]   His addict is getting dark.
[02:14:35.840 --> 02:14:37.120]   Yes.
[02:14:37.120 --> 02:14:38.320]   I didn't plan for this.
[02:14:38.320 --> 02:14:41.360]   It's a cave in there.
[02:14:41.360 --> 02:14:43.280]   Honestly, you look like a serial killer.
[02:14:43.280 --> 02:14:44.160]   That's all I'm going to say.
[02:14:44.160 --> 02:14:45.040]   All right.
[02:14:45.040 --> 02:14:48.240]   I'll pull into the light a little bit more.
[02:14:48.240 --> 02:14:50.720]   Either that or a YouTube star.
[02:14:50.720 --> 02:14:51.520]   One or the other.
[02:14:51.520 --> 02:14:52.160]   Thank you, Seth.
[02:14:52.160 --> 02:14:52.320]   There you go.
[02:14:52.320 --> 02:14:53.040]   Always a pleasure.
[02:14:53.040 --> 02:14:54.880]   Thank you so much for joining us.
[02:14:54.880 --> 02:14:55.520]   My pleasure.
[02:14:55.520 --> 02:14:56.640]   And Brianna Wu,
[02:14:56.640 --> 02:14:58.640]   I know your day is not yet over.
[02:14:58.640 --> 02:14:59.920]   You still have interviews to do.
[02:14:59.920 --> 02:15:01.120]   I do.
[02:15:01.120 --> 02:15:03.440]   I've got a meeting with a group that's
[02:15:03.440 --> 02:15:05.760]   endorsing me that I can't announce yet.
[02:15:05.760 --> 02:15:07.920]   But I'll do anything with them.
[02:15:07.920 --> 02:15:08.640]   Yes, you will.
[02:15:08.640 --> 02:15:10.400]   What can we do to help you?
[02:15:10.400 --> 02:15:10.720]   Yes.
[02:15:10.720 --> 02:15:11.920]   Can I tell you?
[02:15:11.920 --> 02:15:13.920]   I so this is the time of year.
[02:15:13.920 --> 02:15:17.040]   I've been calling all of our donors to thank them.
[02:15:17.040 --> 02:15:21.760]   And I swear to God, I've called at least 10 people this last week.
[02:15:21.760 --> 02:15:24.320]   And I'm like, what are we doing that you'd like so we can do more of it.
[02:15:24.320 --> 02:15:26.560]   And they're like, I saw you on Twitter.
[02:15:26.560 --> 02:15:27.840]   We love your work on Twitter.
[02:15:27.840 --> 02:15:29.200]   We want to see you in Congress.
[02:15:29.200 --> 02:15:31.120]   So thank you for inviting me on Leo.
[02:15:31.120 --> 02:15:33.040]   I always meet so many great people.
[02:15:33.040 --> 02:15:37.200]   And sometimes people say, oh, you know, it's just, you know,
[02:15:37.200 --> 02:15:38.960]   you're just promoting her for Congress.
[02:15:38.960 --> 02:15:43.520]   No, no, we have Brianna on because she's smart and she's articulate.
[02:15:43.520 --> 02:15:46.160]   She's a great contributor to the panel.
[02:15:46.160 --> 02:15:49.120]   The fact that she's running for Congress has nothing to do with it.
[02:15:49.120 --> 02:15:51.040]   But I'll tell you what, if I run Massachusetts 8th,
[02:15:51.040 --> 02:15:52.240]   I know where my vote would go.
[02:15:52.240 --> 02:15:53.280]   Thank you.
[02:15:53.280 --> 02:15:53.760]   Yeah.
[02:15:53.760 --> 02:15:56.720]   And of course, Brianna Wu for Congress is the website.
[02:15:56.720 --> 02:15:59.280]   And we thank you so much.
[02:15:59.280 --> 02:15:59.760]   Good luck.
[02:15:59.760 --> 02:16:02.080]   September, how do you say you get out?
[02:16:02.080 --> 02:16:03.840]   It's on September 1st.
[02:16:03.840 --> 02:16:04.080]   Yep.
[02:16:04.080 --> 02:16:07.680]   And people want to support me and they can do that by going to supportbrianna.com.
[02:16:07.680 --> 02:16:09.600]   Awesome, Brianna.
[02:16:09.600 --> 02:16:10.960]   Really appreciate it.
[02:16:10.960 --> 02:16:16.800]   We do Twitch every Sunday about 21 30 UTC.
[02:16:16.800 --> 02:16:19.360]   Wait, is that wrong?
[02:16:19.360 --> 02:16:21.120]   Is it 22 30 UTC?
[02:16:21.120 --> 02:16:22.240]   Oh, crap.
[02:16:22.240 --> 02:16:30.480]   22 15 UTC, which is about 215 Pacific, 515 Eastern, but I like 22 15 UTC.
[02:16:30.480 --> 02:16:35.280]   And if you would like to watch us do it live, you can go to twitter.tv/live.
[02:16:35.280 --> 02:16:40.480]   As I mentioned, I'm sad to say we are not currently accepting requests to join us in
[02:16:40.480 --> 02:16:40.880]   studio.
[02:16:40.880 --> 02:16:44.720]   We're trying to keep our staff safe and exposure down.
[02:16:44.720 --> 02:16:48.160]   So I apologize if you're coming to Northern California and you had planned to see us.
[02:16:48.160 --> 02:16:48.880]   I apologize.
[02:16:49.680 --> 02:16:56.160]   Sincerely, but as soon as this thing blows over, we'll be glad to reopen.
[02:16:56.160 --> 02:17:00.240]   Meanwhile, at least we have the live stream, twitter.tv/live audio and video.
[02:17:00.240 --> 02:17:05.200]   You can also get on-demand versions of everything we do at our website, twitter.tv.
[02:17:05.200 --> 02:17:09.360]   Best thing to do, honestly, is subscribe.
[02:17:09.360 --> 02:17:16.480]   Whatever your preferred platform is, subscribe, pocket cast, stitcher, slacker, podcast from
[02:17:16.480 --> 02:17:19.840]   Google or Apple, YouTube. Whatever it is, subscribe.
[02:17:19.840 --> 02:17:23.840]   That way you'll get the show the minute it's available on a Sunday night, just in time for your
[02:17:23.840 --> 02:17:25.040]   Monday morning commute.
[02:17:25.040 --> 02:17:32.560]   Thank you everybody for being here. Please wash your hands, stay safe, social distancing.
[02:17:32.560 --> 02:17:36.160]   That means listen to more podcasts. We'll see you next time. Another Twitch.
[02:17:36.320 --> 02:17:50.320]   This is amazing.
