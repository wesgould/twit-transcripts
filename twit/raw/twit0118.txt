[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:53.080]   [ Music ]
[00:00:53.080 --> 00:00:56.760]   This is Twit, episode 118 in an unusual panel today.
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.040]   Let me tell you, first of all, let's welcome back a couple
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:03.880]   of previous Twits, Denise Howell, who is the host of
[00:01:03.880 --> 00:01:07.480]   This Week in Law and also an IP attorney and perhaps the
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.080]   best known, certainly one of the best known law bloggers
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:11.080]   in existence.
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:12.080]   Hey Denise.
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:13.280]   Hey, we are great to be back.
[00:01:13.280 --> 00:01:15.320]   Thank you for joining us again.
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.360]   You put your son aside, is he watching Nemo?
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:23.800]   I don't know, he's under dad's control and I'm just turning
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:25.200]   my back and letting them go.
[00:01:25.200 --> 00:01:27.080]   This time you were on, he was in front of finding Nemo, then he
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.680]   found Nemo and so the whole thing collapsed in a blob.
[00:01:30.680 --> 00:01:32.680]   We all found Nemo.
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:39.440]   Her blog is Bag and baggage at BGBG.blogspot.com.
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:41.480]   Do you still do the Vox and all the other stuff?
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:42.480]   I do.
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:44.960]   And the place I sort of write my most substantive legal stuff
[00:01:44.960 --> 00:01:46.640]   these days is at ZDNet.
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:52.400]   I write logarithms there, which is L-A-W-G-A-R-I-T-H-M-S.com.

[00:01:54.400 --> 00:01:58.240]   Jerry Parnell is also back Mr. Chaos Manor from chaos for
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:01.040]   manorreviews.com.
[00:02:01.040 --> 00:02:03.240]   The father of us all in many ways.
[00:02:03.240 --> 00:02:04.400]   I mean, let's put it this way.
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:08.440]   Jerry hired Devorak back when he was an unknown wine writer.
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:12.280]   Jerry, it's good to have you on the show.
[00:02:12.280 --> 00:02:13.280]   Thank you.
[00:02:13.280 --> 00:02:15.880]   And Jerry's Chaos Manor columns for many years was the
[00:02:15.880 --> 00:02:16.880]   inspiration for me.
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:18.920]   I read it religiously every month in Bite Magazine.
[00:02:18.920 --> 00:02:22.640]   It's now online at chaosmanorreviews.com.
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.240]   And a newbie on the show, Brad Stone is tanned and
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:27.240]   muscular.
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:28.240]   He is known for his--
[00:02:28.240 --> 00:02:29.240]   Oh, wait a minute.
[00:02:29.240 --> 00:02:30.240]   That's the wrong Wikipedia entry.
[00:02:30.240 --> 00:02:34.240]   Let me go back to the Brad Stone journalist page.
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:36.840]   You probably get that a lot, Brad.
[00:02:36.840 --> 00:02:40.200]   Well, I think I've done more to promote the Gabe Parnstar
[00:02:40.200 --> 00:02:43.480]   Brad Stone than he did himself during the--
[00:02:43.480 --> 00:02:47.360]   But I love that if you Google my name about half of the
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:49.960]   results on the first page are pornographic.
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:52.160]   Nowadays, when people name their kids-- and I know you have
[00:02:52.160 --> 00:02:54.200]   twins on the way, you might want to keep this in mind.
[00:02:54.200 --> 00:02:57.120]   They pick names that are unique on Google.
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:59.080]   Yeah, it's only my parents who have done that.
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:01.080]   So maybe Saphronia Stone.
[00:03:01.080 --> 00:03:02.920]   You might think of something like that.
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.920]   Something really odd so that there's no-- and you've got
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.520]   to come up with two of them too.
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:10.240]   Brad, is there a lot of Greek goddesses you could go through?
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:10.880]   There you go.
[00:03:10.880 --> 00:03:11.720]   Yeah.
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:12.640]   That would be good.
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:12.960]   Let's see.
[00:03:12.960 --> 00:03:15.040]   What would be good with Stone?
[00:03:15.040 --> 00:03:15.840]   Xerxes.
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:16.840]   Burt Jipperi.
[00:03:16.840 --> 00:03:18.520]   Are there girls though, right?
[00:03:18.520 --> 00:03:19.280]   Yeah, two girls.
[00:03:19.280 --> 00:03:20.760]   Terp Sikory would be good.
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:22.440]   Start with Amuses.
[00:03:22.440 --> 00:03:25.280]   How do you spell that?
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:27.600]   Get used to it because if you name a kid Terp Sikory, you'll
[00:03:27.600 --> 00:03:30.040]   be hearing a lot of that.
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.400]   Brad writes about the internet for The New York Times for many
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:35.760]   years at Newsweek Magazine.
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:40.880]   And he also is married to the mother of his twins, Jennifer
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.440]   Granik, who is executive director of Stanford Law School
[00:03:43.440 --> 00:03:45.360]   Center for the Internet and Society, and just took a new
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.880]   position at the EFF if I'm not mistaken.
[00:03:48.880 --> 00:03:50.080]   She did.
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:52.000]   What's she going to be doing over there?
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.480]   She'll be working on Fourth Amendment stuff and privacy
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:58.240]   and helping out on their team.
[00:03:58.240 --> 00:03:59.080]   Wonderful.
[00:03:59.080 --> 00:04:01.400]   That's a great cause and a great thing to do.
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:05.440]   Brad is also maybe best known lately for as the guy who
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.960]   figured out who fake Steve was.
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:08.600]   How did you do that?
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:12.160]   You tracked down his phone records?
[00:04:12.160 --> 00:04:13.000]   No.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.480]   What I did was-- well, after I got an early copy of his book,
[00:04:17.480 --> 00:04:19.960]   I guess it was about two or three months ago now, which, by
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:21.040]   the way, is fantastic.
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:21.680]   And it's going on sale.
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:22.080]   Oh, really?
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.080]   This is amazing.
[00:04:23.080 --> 00:04:26.840]   I was thinking to myself, this guy has to be a professional
[00:04:26.840 --> 00:04:30.880]   writer or a novelist, an accomplished novelist.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:32.080]   And I--
[00:04:32.080 --> 00:04:34.480]   So you didn't use any pretexting at all for this?
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:35.120]   I did.
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.600]   I should have, but I didn't.
[00:04:36.600 --> 00:04:38.320]   And I was just long story short.
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:43.480]   I was calling around publishing circles looking for anyone
[00:04:43.480 --> 00:04:45.880]   who had had that book pitched to them.
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:48.480]   And I found someone who was at least familiar with the
[00:04:48.480 --> 00:04:51.960]   cover letter that the Capo pressed the publishers had sent.
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.960]   And it had mentioned that he was a novelist and that he worked
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:56.600]   for a major business publication.
[00:04:56.600 --> 00:05:00.400]   I just sort of went through all the biz pubs, plugging
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:02.880]   people's names into Amazon.com.
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:05.400]   And I did Forbes, and I came across Dan Lyons.
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:07.920]   And that was the genesis of it.
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:11.240]   And then I kind of tracked him down and compared some of his
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:13.480]   writings and that all fell into place.
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:14.480]   Very interesting.
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.280]   He was, of course, pleased to hear from me.
[00:05:17.280 --> 00:05:19.120]   Was he?
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:21.600]   No, actually, he's got twins also.
[00:05:21.600 --> 00:05:23.880]   And they're like two years old.
[00:05:23.880 --> 00:05:27.120]   And they were on-- it was their first day of a vacation.
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:27.960]   So he was--
[00:05:27.960 --> 00:05:29.280]   He was bad timing, unfortunately.
[00:05:29.280 --> 00:05:30.160]   Was he mad?
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:32.200]   Was he angry?
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:36.200]   He's such a fun, funny guy that he took it pretty well.
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:36.960]   Bustid.
[00:05:36.960 --> 00:05:38.920]   Bustid, dude.
[00:05:38.920 --> 00:05:41.200]   Well, speaking of bustid, I think my favorite story of the
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:42.600]   week really isn't a text story.
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:45.200]   But anybody who's had to deal with customer service is going
[00:05:45.200 --> 00:05:45.600]   to love it.
[00:05:45.600 --> 00:05:49.880]   It's about the Washington Post story, about the 75-year-old
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:55.200]   woman who took a hammer to Comcast customer support.
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:05:56.880]   She'd had a pretty bad run around.
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:58.960]   Her name is Mona Shaw.
[00:05:58.960 --> 00:06:02.680]   And according to her, now Comcast disputes it.
[00:06:02.680 --> 00:06:06.280]   They say, well, we can't relase publicly their customer
[00:06:06.280 --> 00:06:07.080]   service records.
[00:06:07.080 --> 00:06:09.400]   But it isn't as she told the story.
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.880]   But what she says is she had booked Comcast in to install
[00:06:13.880 --> 00:06:17.840]   that triple play thing, the phone and the data and the TV.
[00:06:17.840 --> 00:06:18.800]   And they never showed up.
[00:06:18.800 --> 00:06:21.120]   Showed up two days later, left before it was done.
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:24.360]   And then two days after that, the whole thing was disconnected.
[00:06:24.360 --> 00:06:25.160]   So she was mad.
[00:06:25.160 --> 00:06:29.680]   She went down to the public to the public Comcast office in
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:31.640]   Manassas.
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:35.920]   They said, well, she said, I want to speak to a supervisor.
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:37.720]   The representative said, somebody will be right with you.
[00:06:37.720 --> 00:06:39.000]   Just go outside.
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:39.520]   Sit outside.
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:44.200]   This is mid-August in Manassas, where it's a little bit warm.
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:46.560]   And they sat there for two hours.
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:47.960]   Nobody showed up.
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:50.200]   Finally, the representative sticks her head out the door
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:52.440]   and says, oh, I'm sorry, the manager's left.
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:53.760]   But thanks for coming.
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:54.760]   See you later.
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:57.440]   She gets fed up, gets her husband's hammer, goes down the
[00:06:57.440 --> 00:07:01.000]   next Monday and beats up the place.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.480]   Doesn't hurt anybody, but damages a computer, a phone, a
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:04.280]   keyboard.
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:05.080]   The police come.
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:06.000]   She hyperventilates.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.280]   The ambulance comes.
[00:07:08.280 --> 00:07:09.280]   Everybody.
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:11.440]   So this wasn't just a spontaneous helper.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:14.160]   She actually had time to cool off as you went back into
[00:07:14.160 --> 00:07:15.160]   the interview.
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.240]   Cremeditated would apply here.
[00:07:16.240 --> 00:07:17.920]   I'm no lawyer, Denise.
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:18.760]   Beautiful.
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:19.160]   Yeah.
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.160]   And of course, everybody's saying, oh, Tisk Tisk, you
[00:07:21.160 --> 00:07:22.680]   can't do this, but--
[00:07:22.680 --> 00:07:24.160]   Right on.
[00:07:24.160 --> 00:07:25.920]   Just Google Monashaw.
[00:07:25.920 --> 00:07:27.360]   You get the whole story.
[00:07:27.360 --> 00:07:28.920]   She's a hero.
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:32.440]   They'll be the statues built to her.
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:34.000]   Well, I'll send her a donation.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:36.720]   And I think EFFF ought to defend her.
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:38.320]   Well, I think she got off pretty lightly.
[00:07:38.320 --> 00:07:41.600]   They gave her a suspended sentence to find her $345 for
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:45.360]   restitution because she had to replace the keyboard and the
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:46.240]   phone.
[00:07:46.240 --> 00:07:50.880]   And by the way, she does have her phone service from Verizon.
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:54.000]   Not going back to Comcast.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.640]   We're not advocating violence against anybody, but--
[00:07:57.640 --> 00:07:59.720]   Boy, everybody can sympathize, I think.
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:02.960]   No, but if you have to go, Viola, that could give you a
[00:08:02.960 --> 00:08:05.040]   list of places to start.
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:09.040]   Comcast might be right out close to the top of the list.
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:11.240]   Comcast is actually getting a little heat from the AP.
[00:08:11.240 --> 00:08:12.160]   I haven't really followed this.
[00:08:12.160 --> 00:08:14.360]   Maybe, Brad, you can fill us in a little bit better, but an
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:19.440]   AP reporter heard a lot of the forums they've been saying, oh,
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.200]   I can't start a bit torrent seed.
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:25.520]   Somehow my bit torrent stuff seems to be throttled or
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:26.560]   stopped.
[00:08:26.560 --> 00:08:30.560]   And so this Intrepid AP reporter did some experiments.
[00:08:30.560 --> 00:08:33.560]   And apparently, he came up with a result that, in fact, not
[00:08:33.560 --> 00:08:36.640]   only was Comcast blocking bit torrent traffic, but they were
[00:08:36.640 --> 00:08:40.800]   spoofing the guy who was trying to use it, sending out a
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:44.400]   message on his behalf, discontinuing the torrent.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:44.800]   Right.
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:48.000]   And just to add to that, the EFF has been running some
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:49.400]   experiments itself.
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.720]   And you can look on its deep links blog.
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:54.720]   I think they were caught a little, by surprise, by the AP
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:55.520]   story.
[00:08:55.520 --> 00:09:00.080]   But then yesterday, on Friday last week, they released the
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.440]   results of their own test, which showed some
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:06.440]   interruptions of some bit torrent seeds, and also Nutella
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:10.120]   they found as being blocked, both in San Francisco and up
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:11.920]   in Oregon.
[00:09:11.920 --> 00:09:16.200]   Comcast has not given us a good explanation yet for what
[00:09:16.200 --> 00:09:16.840]   they're doing.
[00:09:16.840 --> 00:09:18.440]   And I tried last week.
[00:09:18.440 --> 00:09:21.080]   When the AP story broke, and I was thinking about following
[00:09:21.080 --> 00:09:24.560]   it up for the New York Times, I was leaving messages and
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:26.120]   talking to their communications people.
[00:09:26.120 --> 00:09:29.240]   I don't think they even know what's happening.
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:33.440]   And obviously, the question is, was this premeditated
[00:09:33.440 --> 00:09:36.960]   interference of peer-to-peer networks and piracy?
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:42.800]   Or was it some sort of network management, self-preservation
[00:09:42.800 --> 00:09:46.600]   kind of technology that they have going on here to balance
[00:09:46.600 --> 00:09:49.720]   the load and fulfill all their promised speeds to their
[00:09:49.720 --> 00:09:51.240]   broadband customers?
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:53.800]   I'm waiting for Comcast to come out and give us a
[00:09:53.800 --> 00:09:57.800]   technologically sound explanation for what people are
[00:09:57.800 --> 00:09:58.240]   seeing.
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:01.120]   Their only explanation so far is, no, we don't do that.
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:03.640]   Which of that odds with reality?
[00:10:03.640 --> 00:10:05.680]   We're not doing that.
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:06.640]   Right.
[00:10:06.640 --> 00:10:09.880]   But they were telling me on Friday, even though they
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:12.760]   couldn't explain it, they were basically acknowledging that
[00:10:12.760 --> 00:10:16.360]   their public statement was at odds with confirmed reality.
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:18.360]   Oh, interesting.
[00:10:18.360 --> 00:10:20.720]   So it's more than traffic shaping, it sounds like.
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:23.520]   Traffic shaping then would be an automated system just
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:25.480]   looking at different kinds of packets and saying, well, I'm
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:26.400]   going to slow those down.
[00:10:26.400 --> 00:10:27.560]   I'm going to speed those up.
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.640]   This sounds like it's much more active where it's actually
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:33.520]   sending a disconnect message on behalf of the user.
[00:10:33.520 --> 00:10:36.120]   That doesn't sound like something automated.
[00:10:36.120 --> 00:10:36.680]   I mean, it could be--
[00:10:36.680 --> 00:10:37.280]   It doesn't.
[00:10:37.280 --> 00:10:38.480]   It doesn't.
[00:10:38.480 --> 00:10:43.160]   Sounds like somebody is actually approving doing that.
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:46.200]   Does this bring the neutrality debate into focus?
[00:10:46.200 --> 00:10:49.560]   I mean, until now, we haven't really had a smoking gun.
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:50.440]   Denise?
[00:10:50.440 --> 00:10:54.440]   Well, the lawyer in me is thinking about this and saying,
[00:10:54.440 --> 00:10:58.360]   there's so much legitimate activity that goes on
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:10:59.720]   on peer-to-peer networks.
[00:10:59.720 --> 00:11:03.400]   I mean, particularly BitTorrent these days.
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:09.800]   And if they are actually disconnecting people,
[00:11:09.800 --> 00:11:12.600]   I could see somebody coming up and saying, you know what?
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.440]   I was conducting a very important business transaction,
[00:11:15.440 --> 00:11:17.360]   and I've been damaged.
[00:11:17.360 --> 00:11:19.360]   Yeah, I needed that Star Wars 3 movie.
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:20.680]   That wasn't important.
[00:11:20.680 --> 00:11:22.040]   No, you make a good point, though.
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:23.840]   And in fact, I've said this, too, because we
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.400]   used BitTorrent for a long time for Twit
[00:11:25.400 --> 00:11:26.560]   to distribute our files.
[00:11:26.560 --> 00:11:28.200]   Linux distributions use it.
[00:11:28.200 --> 00:11:32.680]   There's a lot of legitimate legal uses of peer-to-peer.
[00:11:32.680 --> 00:11:33.640]   Oh, absolutely.
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.560]   Of course, the brilliance of the AP story
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:36.840]   was that they were in their test.
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:38.760]   They used the Bible.
[00:11:38.760 --> 00:11:40.160]   Well, it's not illegal to distribute that,
[00:11:40.160 --> 00:11:41.520]   unless God has a copyright.
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:43.040]   I don't know.
[00:11:43.040 --> 00:11:47.360]   If it is from the life of the author forward, isn't it?
[00:11:47.360 --> 00:11:48.800]   Yeah, plus almost eternity.
[00:11:48.800 --> 00:11:50.800]   But the Bible would be in the public domain at this point.
[00:11:50.800 --> 00:11:51.800]   OK.
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.240]   That's pre-McGee Mouse, I guess.
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:56.240]   Almost eternity is 90 years, isn't it?
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:11:56.800]   It is.
[00:11:56.800 --> 00:11:58.640]   But it keeps getting extended as long as--
[00:11:58.640 --> 00:12:00.840]   whenever Mickey Mouse's copyright comes up.
[00:12:00.840 --> 00:12:04.000]   It does look that way, which is ridiculous.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:06.440]   You know how the 50 years came about.
[00:12:06.440 --> 00:12:07.840]   No, I don't.
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:09.160]   A Victor Hugo.
[00:12:09.160 --> 00:12:14.160]   The burn convention was essentially dictated by Victor Hugo.
[00:12:14.160 --> 00:12:20.040]   And it was to be life plus 50 years and no renewals at all.
[00:12:20.040 --> 00:12:26.720]   And when the Congress decided to put the United States
[00:12:26.720 --> 00:12:33.920]   under the burn convention, we had to go from what we had had,
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:39.200]   which was 28 plus 28 with a renewal in the 28th year
[00:12:39.200 --> 00:12:41.480]   to the life plus 50.
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:46.240]   And they got in the treaty that they could add more to it.
[00:12:46.240 --> 00:12:48.920]   But we could never go under life plus 50 years,
[00:12:48.920 --> 00:12:52.160]   as long as we're part of the burn convention.
[00:12:52.160 --> 00:12:54.600]   I'm just going to make some joke about Les Misérables,
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:56.280]   but I can't think of anything.
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:59.720]   Well, that was Victor Hugo, basically single-handedly
[00:12:59.720 --> 00:13:02.440]   convinced the Europeans to go that way.
[00:13:02.440 --> 00:13:04.600]   So he was the Disney of his time.
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:07.000]   More so than that, even, I guess.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:10.080]   You know, Victor Hugo had the largest funeral
[00:13:10.080 --> 00:13:11.240]   in the history of the world.
[00:13:11.240 --> 00:13:12.240]   Really?
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:13.240]   Yeah.
[00:13:13.240 --> 00:13:14.240]   That was--
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:16.160]   It was my US guilt about Disneyland Paris
[00:13:16.160 --> 00:13:17.760]   has somewhat about me now.
[00:13:17.760 --> 00:13:21.640]   But were you there, Jerry, at that funeral or just teasing?
[00:13:21.640 --> 00:13:22.640]   No.
[00:13:22.640 --> 00:13:25.280]   No, not quite.
[00:13:25.280 --> 00:13:28.360]   I couldn't get a boat.
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:30.880]   So getting back to Comcast--
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:33.560]   and actually, really, it brings up the net neutrality issue.
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:36.880]   Is this going to bring net neutrality back to the four?
[00:13:36.880 --> 00:13:40.440]   I mean, here we have the major internet service provider
[00:13:40.440 --> 00:13:42.400]   in the US.
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:44.200]   I think that we've caught them red-handed,
[00:13:44.200 --> 00:13:47.120]   doing exactly that kind of discrimination
[00:13:47.120 --> 00:13:48.720]   that we were talking about.
[00:13:48.720 --> 00:13:50.520]   I know that it happens in Canada.
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:52.880]   I know both Sean Rogers have been accused
[00:13:52.880 --> 00:13:57.520]   of blocking VoIP traffic.
[00:13:57.520 --> 00:14:00.160]   Or does this mean that we'll talk about net neutrality again?
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:02.440]   Or is that just dead, dead, dead?
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:04.600]   Well, it hasn't seemed to me to be dead.
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:07.240]   I mean, maybe it has gotten somewhat more quiet.
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:12.240]   But I think it's on the minds of the legislators.
[00:14:12.240 --> 00:14:13.240]   It comes up.
[00:14:13.240 --> 00:14:14.080]   It ought to be now.
[00:14:14.080 --> 00:14:15.080]   Yeah.
[00:14:15.080 --> 00:14:19.160]   As you all know, I probably am the lone figure here.
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:23.440]   But I don't think we ought to be regulating--
[00:14:23.440 --> 00:14:25.640]   We talked about this last time you were on Jerry.
[00:14:25.640 --> 00:14:26.800]   That's correct.
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:27.320]   That's right.
[00:14:27.320 --> 00:14:29.360]   I don't think, though, that we ought
[00:14:29.360 --> 00:14:31.960]   to enforce truth and advertising.
[00:14:31.960 --> 00:14:35.960]   If an ISP-- most of the customers
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:40.200]   have a legitimate interest in limiting some services,
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:42.920]   if 90% of the bandwidth is being used up
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:46.720]   by people downloading porn, then the other users
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:50.320]   have some right to say, wait a minute.
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:52.040]   On the other hand, they ought to tell you
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:54.960]   what limits they place on what you can do.
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.160]   Well, Comcast is notorious for not doing that.
[00:14:57.160 --> 00:15:00.040]   They have a kind of secret bandwidth limit
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:03.040]   that they've never revealed, but they haven't forced.
[00:15:03.040 --> 00:15:03.760]   That's correct.
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:06.520]   And if they advertise unlimited bandwidth,
[00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:10.600]   then it seems to me they ought to provide unlimited bandwidth.
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:13.800]   But if they will say that we are going
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:15.760]   to limit it under certain circumstances,
[00:15:15.760 --> 00:15:18.200]   they at least gave you a warning about that.
[00:15:18.200 --> 00:15:23.080]   I don't really believe that all of that dark fiber
[00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:25.680]   should be lit up with porn.
[00:15:25.680 --> 00:15:26.200]   No.
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.080]   I just don't see any reason to.
[00:15:28.080 --> 00:15:32.320]   Especially if our conversations right now
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:35.680]   suddenly drag because somebody else is coming
[00:15:35.680 --> 00:15:37.600]   and using up the bandwidth.
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:39.600]   But at the same time, that's making an assumption
[00:15:39.600 --> 00:15:41.920]   about what's going on with BitTorrent that may not be accurate.
[00:15:41.920 --> 00:15:44.920]   I mean, let's face it, probably most BitTorrent traffic,
[00:15:44.920 --> 00:15:46.640]   most new, certainly almost all new,
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:51.440]   tele traffic is copyright materials that are being traded.
[00:15:51.440 --> 00:15:55.640]   It's intellectual piracy, which takes money out of my pocket.
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:16:00.520]   That, as you probably know, is my one real beef with EFF.
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:04.960]   And I've been a supporter of EFF for a long time,
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:08.240]   but they were on the wrong side on that Scribdimis,
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:09.400]   as an example.
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:11.840]   It's pretty interesting if you look at what happened
[00:16:11.840 --> 00:16:16.520]   with the Radiohead album, Rainbows,
[00:16:16.520 --> 00:16:18.280]   which they were giving away, or they said,
[00:16:18.280 --> 00:16:19.440]   "Come to our site, download it.
[00:16:19.440 --> 00:16:21.280]   It's whatever you want to pay for it.
[00:16:21.280 --> 00:16:24.320]   You could pay nothing and download the album for free."
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:27.600]   Nevertheless, people are, it's still being downloaded
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:31.080]   like crazy from the torrent sites illegally.
[00:16:31.080 --> 00:16:32.640]   Yeah.
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:36.680]   We'll take a long time for consumers,
[00:16:36.680 --> 00:16:40.800]   you know, for people used to using those file sharing networks
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.480]   to download music, to begin to change their habits.
[00:16:43.480 --> 00:16:49.320]   And I mean, the Radiohead step was ambitious and sort of courageous,
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:51.760]   but it's the first move.
[00:16:51.760 --> 00:16:54.120]   And I don't think you can expect a lot of the people
[00:16:54.120 --> 00:16:57.120]   that have been, you know, getting their music and their movies
[00:16:57.120 --> 00:17:00.920]   in this way to immediately kind of, you know, kind of see the light.
[00:17:00.920 --> 00:17:04.000]   Do you think people think it's even know that it's illegal?
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:05.600]   Do you think it's just kind of automatic?
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:06.240]   They just do it.
[00:17:06.240 --> 00:17:08.160]   They don't pay any attention to whether they're getting it
[00:17:08.160 --> 00:17:09.120]   legitimately or not.
[00:17:09.120 --> 00:17:11.040]   It's just there and they get it.
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.440]   Oh, I think particularly in this Radiohead instance,
[00:17:13.440 --> 00:17:15.240]   I think a lot of people believe that it's legal
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:18.120]   because they know they can get it for free on the site.
[00:17:18.120 --> 00:17:19.760]   You know, that's been publicized.
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:21.040]   So...
[00:17:21.040 --> 00:17:22.640]   And I already have Nutella running,
[00:17:22.640 --> 00:17:24.760]   or I've already got my BitTorrent running.
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:26.080]   Why not just do it that way?
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:27.480]   Right. It's a convenience issue.
[00:17:27.480 --> 00:17:30.480]   You know, even though people know they could go and watch clips
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:34.160]   of Saturday Night Live for free at nbc.com,
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:35.760]   they'd rather get it from YouTube
[00:17:35.760 --> 00:17:36.960]   because that's what they're used to doing.
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:37.800]   It's convenient.
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:38.640]   Yeah, 'cause I want to throw it on an empty screen.
[00:17:38.640 --> 00:17:39.960]   And I'll give you a gray area.
[00:17:39.960 --> 00:17:42.760]   When the Rome series was on,
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:47.960]   I managed somehow not to record the last episode
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:49.680]   where Caesar is killed.
[00:17:49.680 --> 00:17:50.520]   I didn't have it.
[00:17:50.520 --> 00:17:51.720]   Oh, you spoiled it.
[00:17:51.720 --> 00:17:53.280]   They killed Caesar?
[00:17:53.280 --> 00:17:55.520]   Oh, yeah, Brutus did it too, buddy.
[00:17:55.520 --> 00:17:57.880]   Oh, no, oh, that's awful.
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:01.080]   But I didn't have it and I wanted to see it.
[00:18:01.080 --> 00:18:04.640]   Well, it was very easy to fire up BitTorrent and get it.
[00:18:04.640 --> 00:18:06.880]   But you pay for HBO.
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:08.600]   I pay for HBO.
[00:18:08.600 --> 00:18:12.160]   I just forgot to turn on the Bloomin' recorder
[00:18:12.160 --> 00:18:13.480]   when it came on.
[00:18:13.480 --> 00:18:18.320]   I mean, I am certainly legally entitled to have a copy,
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:23.320]   including a copy burned off onto a CD or a DVD.
[00:18:23.320 --> 00:18:27.360]   So why shouldn't I be able to download a copy?
[00:18:27.360 --> 00:18:28.200]   Well, is it?
[00:18:28.200 --> 00:18:29.640]   I mean, nobody would argue that, right?
[00:18:29.640 --> 00:18:32.040]   I don't think they're gonna sue me over it.
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:32.880]   No.
[00:18:32.880 --> 00:18:36.840]   I hear I am admitting I violated the law.
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:39.560]   Do you guys ever read Ed Bot's Microsoft report on ZDNet?
[00:18:39.560 --> 00:18:40.400]   Yeah, that's great.
[00:18:40.400 --> 00:18:42.920]   In fact, we're gonna have Ed on security now next week.
[00:18:42.920 --> 00:18:43.760]   Or Windows Media.
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:46.560]   He did a great poll on his blog.
[00:18:46.560 --> 00:18:48.280]   I think it was just last week
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:50.160]   that was like a media ethics poll,
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:53.120]   just asking open-ended questions about,
[00:18:53.120 --> 00:18:54.840]   is it okay to copy a CD?
[00:18:54.840 --> 00:18:56.080]   How about a DVD?
[00:18:56.080 --> 00:18:57.520]   Yes, some really good questions
[00:18:57.520 --> 00:18:58.960]   and got a huge response,
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:01.400]   thousands and thousands of respondents to the poll.
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:04.840]   So I think he's just now kind of waiting through all the responses
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:07.400]   and comments and trying to synthesize,
[00:19:07.400 --> 00:19:10.080]   you know, the temperature he was able to take
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:11.440]   of the public on these issues.
[00:19:11.440 --> 00:19:12.880]   But it's really interesting.
[00:19:12.880 --> 00:19:15.920]   He says, okay, is it okay to borrow a CD from a friend
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:17.960]   and rip it to your hard drive?
[00:19:17.960 --> 00:19:21.960]   34% yes, 53% no.
[00:19:21.960 --> 00:19:23.160]   Now, I guess is it okay?
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:26.640]   Does that mean, is it legal or is it okay with you, right?
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:27.480]   Is it proper?
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:28.760]   Yeah, I think you left that pretty open.
[00:19:28.760 --> 00:19:29.600]   Yeah.
[00:19:29.600 --> 00:19:32.160]   Proper, maybe that's a little more clear,
[00:19:32.160 --> 00:19:35.040]   to buy a CD and make a copy for a friend,
[00:19:35.040 --> 00:19:37.440]   yes, 27%, 65% no.
[00:19:37.440 --> 00:19:39.960]   So there you see there, by saying, is it proper?
[00:19:39.960 --> 00:19:45.040]   It was same question, but more people said no,
[00:19:45.040 --> 00:19:46.120]   if you ask, is it proper?
[00:19:46.120 --> 00:19:48.320]   I don't know what that means, but.
[00:19:48.320 --> 00:19:50.920]   I think we all know it's wrong,
[00:19:50.920 --> 00:19:53.760]   or most of us know it's wrong is the wrong word.
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:19:55.880]   Illegal?
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:56.880]   Illegal?
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:19:58.080]   Illegal even seems strong,
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:00.200]   but technically it's correct obviously.
[00:20:00.200 --> 00:20:01.400]   I think we all know it's illegal,
[00:20:01.400 --> 00:20:03.680]   but I think a vast number of people,
[00:20:03.680 --> 00:20:07.640]   and I'll include myself in this, do it anyway.
[00:20:07.640 --> 00:20:12.120]   Well, I think you got upwards of a 97% response
[00:20:12.120 --> 00:20:15.120]   that it's okay to make backups of things that you own,
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:19.040]   even though some may have a difference of opinion on that.
[00:20:19.040 --> 00:20:24.040]   Do not laws eventually reflect what is actual practice?
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:27.040]   Eventually is a big word.
[00:20:27.040 --> 00:20:29.720]   Yeah, but in a hundred years they might.
[00:20:29.720 --> 00:20:30.800]   But fairly quickly.
[00:20:30.800 --> 00:20:32.600]   That's Jamie Thomas, I don't know.
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:36.160]   Maybe not soon enough for her.
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:37.960]   Well, I mean, there are anomalies,
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:43.000]   but one of the reasons that I am always concerned
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   with enforcement of electronic intellectual property rights
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.520]   for authors and why I got so angry with EFF
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:55.800]   over that Scribd enes,
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:59.800]   is that if you don't enforce the rights,
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:04.680]   eventually it will become just customary to seize them.
[00:21:04.680 --> 00:21:07.480]   And when that happens, it's very hard to get back
[00:21:07.480 --> 00:21:09.600]   to the point of it again.
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:11.480]   It's like trespass.
[00:21:11.480 --> 00:21:15.640]   If a hundred people a day cut across your field
[00:21:15.640 --> 00:21:17.080]   in order to go to school,
[00:21:17.080 --> 00:21:20.440]   there comes a time when you can't stop them anymore.
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:21.680]   Yeah.
[00:21:21.680 --> 00:21:23.120]   Yeah, that's correct.
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:28.120]   And I think you're right that law does try to reflect
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:33.320]   societal moorings and values over time.
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:36.680]   Yeah, and over the RIAAs dead body.
[00:21:36.680 --> 00:21:38.160]   Right, that's the thing.
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:40.800]   Is that it draws these lines in the sand
[00:21:40.800 --> 00:21:45.800]   that the law takes decades to catch up with.
[00:21:45.800 --> 00:21:50.200]   But the RIAA is basically the equivalent
[00:21:50.200 --> 00:21:53.040]   of the far horses and guard dogs
[00:21:53.040 --> 00:21:57.160]   in the Selma civil rights marches, isn't it?
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.520]   I write that one down.
[00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:00.000]   (laughing)
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:01.160]   I mean, I don't know.
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:02.560]   That's very interesting, Jerry.
[00:22:02.560 --> 00:22:04.800]   They are legally, they are in forces
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:07.000]   that people fight to do something.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.480]   But they are making that legal right look so despicable.
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:12.320]   Yeah.
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:13.640]   Wow, that's great.
[00:22:13.640 --> 00:22:15.120]   Want to abolish it.
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:18.880]   I mean, Bull Connor was definitely within his rights
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:22.520]   to use the firehose on Martin Luther King at Selma,
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:25.200]   but I am not convinced that he did his cause
[00:22:25.200 --> 00:22:27.360]   a very good year. Interesting.
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:28.280]   Yeah, that's great, Jerry.
[00:22:28.280 --> 00:22:30.720]   That's a wonderful analogy.
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:33.840]   Universal Music is saying, we've got a new idea.
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:37.400]   In fact, apparently they've signed up a BMG,
[00:22:37.400 --> 00:22:39.720]   Sony BMG, another big record label.
[00:22:39.720 --> 00:22:40.960]   They're gonna give away music.
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:43.600]   The idea for their, I think really this is mostly
[00:22:43.600 --> 00:22:44.760]   to put iTunes out of business,
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:46.840]   but their idea is to create a new music store
[00:22:46.840 --> 00:22:48.080]   called Total Music.
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:51.240]   It is a subscription service.
[00:22:51.240 --> 00:22:54.080]   And what they hope to do is sell this
[00:22:54.080 --> 00:22:57.040]   to cell phone, handset manufacturers,
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:00.080]   maybe Microsoft for Zoom, other MP3 players.
[00:23:00.080 --> 00:23:03.480]   When you buy the device, you get the music for free.
[00:23:03.480 --> 00:23:06.880]   It's an intro, I think what I like to see
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:09.560]   is that the music industry thinking of different ways
[00:23:09.560 --> 00:23:10.640]   to make this work.
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:14.120]   Well, you mentioned this last week on Twitch, right, Leo?
[00:23:14.120 --> 00:23:17.880]   And John's comeback was, well, if it's just universal, then--
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:19.400]   Well, that's one thing that's changed
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:21.040]   is now Sony BMG is a parent.
[00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:25.000]   But anyway, according to this article in Business Week,
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:29.080]   Sony BMG has said it might be a partner,
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:30.680]   Warner Music says it might be a partner,
[00:23:30.680 --> 00:23:34.360]   all three of them would control the store.
[00:23:34.360 --> 00:23:36.000]   I think the thing is that they hate Apple
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:37.840]   and they're really scared of what Apple,
[00:23:37.840 --> 00:23:39.520]   the power Apple has.
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:40.920]   Right, so what's this gonna do
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:43.640]   to the cost of our electronic devices?
[00:23:43.640 --> 00:23:45.520]   Well, it's one thing if it's a cell phone
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:47.040]   'cause you're already paying a monthly fee,
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:49.120]   you could build a couple of bucks into that,
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:50.720]   almost transparently.
[00:23:50.720 --> 00:23:52.120]   I don't know if it's gonna work on the Zoom,
[00:23:52.120 --> 00:23:53.640]   I don't know if Microsoft would agree to this.
[00:23:53.640 --> 00:23:56.520]   Although, remember Microsoft is paying universal a sum amount,
[00:23:56.520 --> 00:23:58.280]   we don't know how much per Zoom
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:01.480]   to compensate for all the stealing that's gonna happen
[00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:03.320]   'cause people own Zoom's.
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:04.920]   I don't think that's quite been a windfall
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:06.600]   for Universal at this point.
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:12.480]   But isn't certain amount of that built into the cost
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:14.920]   to see these and DVDs now?
[00:24:14.920 --> 00:24:18.400]   It isn't, not here, it is on some issue.
[00:24:18.400 --> 00:24:19.880]   Remember, they did for that tape,
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:21.800]   which pretty much killed that tape.
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:23.080]   Yeah.
[00:24:23.080 --> 00:24:25.480]   They've done it for the so-called music CDs,
[00:24:25.480 --> 00:24:26.800]   but not for data CDs.
[00:24:26.800 --> 00:24:28.200]   It is in Canada though.
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:30.520]   It's built into all recordable media in Canada.
[00:24:30.520 --> 00:24:32.880]   And you know what's happened there is Canadians say,
[00:24:32.880 --> 00:24:35.160]   well, and courts have agreed in Canada.
[00:24:35.160 --> 00:24:37.440]   Yeah, it's great, that means it's legal for us
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:40.480]   to share music, we're paying for it.
[00:24:40.480 --> 00:24:41.760]   Right.
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:45.440]   Well, if the artist gets the money out of it,
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:47.920]   maybe that's the right way to go.
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:52.920]   What concerns me is, well, again, back to the,
[00:24:52.920 --> 00:24:58.800]   to books which I do understand, I don't really mind
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:01.000]   if you take a copy of one of my books
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:03.160]   and you even put it on your website
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:05.760]   and it's free to download, you don't advertise it,
[00:25:05.760 --> 00:25:08.120]   you're not using it to draw a crowd,
[00:25:08.120 --> 00:25:10.120]   you're not using it to build web traffic,
[00:25:10.120 --> 00:25:11.800]   this is a favor you're doing your friend.
[00:25:11.800 --> 00:25:15.080]   You're not really hurting me, but if you're an outfit
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:18.360]   like Scribdee with $4 million of venture capital
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:20.720]   and your entire business plan
[00:25:20.720 --> 00:25:23.560]   is to get people to come to your website,
[00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:25.800]   what scares me is if somebody wants to buy
[00:25:25.800 --> 00:25:27.880]   an electronic copy of my book
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:30.560]   and he types in the book title in Google,
[00:25:30.560 --> 00:25:33.320]   the first hit is the free copy at Scribdee.
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:35.280]   Well, I think that's completely legitimate, Jerry.
[00:25:35.280 --> 00:25:36.120]   I mean, that's a--
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:39.440]   Not buying books that go little, sell it to him for $4.95,
[00:25:39.440 --> 00:25:41.920]   but this outfit that'll give it to him for nothing.
[00:25:41.920 --> 00:25:42.760]   I think that's--
[00:25:42.760 --> 00:25:44.720]   And I don't know why the Electronic Freedom Foundation
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:46.440]   is writing national letters
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:48.760]   to the science fiction writers of America
[00:25:48.760 --> 00:25:51.440]   threatening us with lawsuits for trying to stop that.
[00:25:51.440 --> 00:25:52.840]   I don't know either.
[00:25:52.840 --> 00:25:55.880]   From what-- that sounds like a reasonable--
[00:25:55.880 --> 00:25:57.800]   I won't speak for the EFF.
[00:25:57.800 --> 00:25:58.960]   There's the dogs, by the way.
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:00.440]   Wait, is that the RIA?
[00:26:00.440 --> 00:26:04.080]   I think our dog here is Gary and the United States.
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.560]   Scribdee is still up and around.
[00:26:05.560 --> 00:26:08.040]   I did-- you've just given them some unnecessary publicity.
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:08.560]   All right.
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:10.680]   You clean the water, they stuff up.
[00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:13.560]   As a result of science fiction writers of America
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:15.840]   and the effort, even though Corey Doctorow
[00:26:15.840 --> 00:26:17.600]   went out of his mind over it.
[00:26:17.600 --> 00:26:21.200]   Yeah, when I saw Scribdee, I thought that was very--
[00:26:21.200 --> 00:26:22.760]   Look, the laws, I think, are pretty good
[00:26:22.760 --> 00:26:26.240]   in terms of protecting you against commercial piracy.
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:30.680]   The issue is the RIAA going against this kind of casual sharing.
[00:26:30.680 --> 00:26:31.760]   Completely agree.
[00:26:31.760 --> 00:26:36.800]   I mean, interestingly enough, many of the artists agree.
[00:26:36.800 --> 00:26:39.160]   I mean, Courtney Love came out at one point
[00:26:39.160 --> 00:26:42.040]   and said, rip off my publisher for heaven's sake.
[00:26:42.040 --> 00:26:44.000]   I don't get the money anyway.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:48.080]   But authors of books are not in the same category.
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:50.880]   I mean, I'd publisher to the class enemy,
[00:26:50.880 --> 00:26:52.040]   but I don't hate my publisher.
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:55.000]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.880]   Brad, you were just at the Web 2.0 conference
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:00.640]   in San Francisco.
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:03.000]   A lot of new websites announced--
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.840]   was it an interesting conference?
[00:27:04.840 --> 00:27:07.520]   Well, you know, I have to say I was a little mixed.
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:11.000]   I think the Web 2.0 conferences have become
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:16.360]   sort of nexus for the kooky over exuberance
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:20.160]   of this latest bubble, if you want to call it a bubble.
[00:27:20.160 --> 00:27:25.080]   You know, I find the hallway chatter useful, meeting people--
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:25.760]   LobbyCon.
[00:27:25.760 --> 00:27:27.200]   You did a lobbyCon.
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:28.480]   You're doing a lobbyCon.
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:31.080]   But in terms of the folks on stage,
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:34.160]   I mean, the calorie content is frighteningly low.
[00:27:34.160 --> 00:27:36.520]   I mean, you have Mark Zuckerberg up there
[00:27:36.520 --> 00:27:40.640]   to kick things off, giving monosyllabic answers.
[00:27:40.640 --> 00:27:42.560]   You know, what passes for news at these things
[00:27:42.560 --> 00:27:46.920]   is when he says that Facebook is close to closing a funding
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:47.280]   round.
[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:48.960]   I mean, you step back and you say, God,
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:53.560]   this is what we're all-- we have our jets and a broil about.
[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:57.040]   Rupert Murdoch and Chris DeWolf from MySpace
[00:27:57.040 --> 00:27:59.560]   gave one of the evening presentations.
[00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:02.160]   You know, it was great to see Rupert Murdoch up there
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:04.520]   with his folksy way, bowing that he's
[00:28:04.520 --> 00:28:06.400]   not to kill the New York Times.
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:08.320]   You know, everybody got a thrill out of that.
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:13.400]   He contributed that Facebook, it's $15 billion,
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:15.320]   was absolutely ridiculous.
[00:28:15.320 --> 00:28:17.920]   But again, in terms of the news content,
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:20.680]   in terms of enlightening, revealing,
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:23.720]   thought-provoking presentations from the executives,
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:25.760]   I thought it was a little disappointing.
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:29.080]   Brad, did you go to Ted Crunch 40 by any chance?
[00:28:29.080 --> 00:28:31.440]   Well, that was-- I would say that was almost worse.
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:35.480]   I endured, I think, about half a day of Ted Crunch 40.
[00:28:35.480 --> 00:28:37.640]   Yeah, I had to pick this year.
[00:28:37.640 --> 00:28:41.920]   I've conventionally gone to Web 2.0 and have enjoyed it
[00:28:41.920 --> 00:28:44.920]   more for the lobby conversations, as you say,
[00:28:44.920 --> 00:28:46.200]   than the content.
[00:28:46.200 --> 00:28:48.720]   Although I do like John Patel as an interviewer.
[00:28:48.720 --> 00:28:52.440]   You know, he tends to get people to relax and actually
[00:28:52.440 --> 00:28:56.480]   have a conversation, which I do enjoy.
[00:28:56.480 --> 00:28:59.520]   But yeah, I went to Ted Crunch 40 this year,
[00:28:59.520 --> 00:29:02.720]   thinking that that was going to be the event of the two
[00:29:02.720 --> 00:29:05.000]   to go to, but you think not, huh?
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:07.240]   Well, they're all packed and there's
[00:29:07.240 --> 00:29:09.120]   a lot of energy and activity to these things.
[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:11.560]   So at Ted Crunch 40, I thought there
[00:29:11.560 --> 00:29:14.400]   was more focused on new companies and new startups.
[00:29:14.400 --> 00:29:17.040]   So remember, a couple of companies
[00:29:17.040 --> 00:29:22.680]   launched like Mints.com, the new kind of Web 2.0 online finance
[00:29:22.680 --> 00:29:24.720]   tool that have gotten some traction,
[00:29:24.720 --> 00:29:30.240]   but some of them are just some nutty ideas of crazy names,
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:32.640]   so unbelievably large financing.
[00:29:32.640 --> 00:29:36.360]   But you'd sort of wonder what the future of some of these
[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:37.720]   companies is.
[00:29:37.720 --> 00:29:41.440]   Or you sure make me glad I didn't.
[00:29:41.440 --> 00:29:43.040]   You're making us all feel better.
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:46.640]   I probably laughed at about a day and a half at Web 2.0,
[00:29:46.640 --> 00:29:49.040]   so I didn't miss some stuff.
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:49.480]   What is it?
[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:50.440]   Is it that it's a bubble?
[00:29:50.440 --> 00:29:51.400]   Is there nothing there?
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:53.760]   Why is it-- what's going on?
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:57.200]   I think it's just-- I mean, the stages have become--
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:29:59.040]   particularly the Web 2.0 summit.
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:01.920]   I mean, it's not a stage that sort of lends itself
[00:30:01.920 --> 00:30:04.040]   to this kind of thoughtful discussion
[00:30:04.040 --> 00:30:06.400]   that you might get at the TED conference
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:10.600]   or sort of the more news-making environments.
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:12.200]   I mean, I guess like CES in a way,
[00:30:12.200 --> 00:30:15.840]   you sort of count on companies coming and rolling out
[00:30:15.840 --> 00:30:18.120]   some new devices and making news.
[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:20.720]   Whereas it's not the case.
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:24.280]   I mean, you see some executives almost playing defense,
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:26.520]   going up on stage with John Patel,
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:28.320]   but then sort of sticking to their guns
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:31.680]   and proving kind of reluctant to say anything.
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:34.440]   How much of this is because big bucks are here.
[00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:40.920]   I mean, with Google valued at more than IBM, Facebook, $15 billion,
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:42.440]   how much of this is--
[00:30:42.440 --> 00:30:45.000]   it's just that it's just out of control.
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:47.160]   The reality has left the building.
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:48.960]   I think everyone who holds a control
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:51.440]   look how much they paid for Skype.
[00:30:51.440 --> 00:30:51.880]   Yeah.
[00:30:51.880 --> 00:30:52.440]   Absolutely.
[00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:54.360]   Yeah, I think everyone pulled in their breath.
[00:30:54.360 --> 00:30:57.880]   I mean, it's lost any logic.
[00:30:57.880 --> 00:30:59.120]   One of the big differences, though,
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:01.160]   is unlike the previous bubble, there
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:02.400]   aren't a lot of IPOs.
[00:31:02.400 --> 00:31:06.080]   So it's not like it's going to be a lot of little investors
[00:31:06.080 --> 00:31:07.680]   are going to lose their shirts here.
[00:31:07.680 --> 00:31:08.320]   Yeah, exactly.
[00:31:08.320 --> 00:31:10.400]   The dynamics are totally different.
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:13.960]   And you could say the first bubble was sort of motivated
[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:15.600]   by greed.
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:19.120]   And this is motivated in large part by the fear,
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:22.600]   by fear of missing out on the next big thing,
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:26.840]   and the kind of the oligopoly of Google and Yahoo
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:28.880]   and Microsoft and eBay to some extent,
[00:31:28.880 --> 00:31:30.920]   competing for these properties, driving
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:32.960]   the prices up into the stratosphere,
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:36.520]   not wanting to lose the property to one of their competitors.
[00:31:36.520 --> 00:31:40.120]   But as we saw with eBay and Skype and to a certain extent,
[00:31:40.120 --> 00:31:44.480]   Google and YouTube, I mean, the numbers are unjustifiable.
[00:31:44.480 --> 00:31:46.840]   Yeah, but I think it's wrong to equate something
[00:31:46.840 --> 00:31:49.240]   like Facebook with pets.com.
[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:52.400]   I mean, there's certainly more value involved
[00:31:52.400 --> 00:31:54.000]   in what's going on today.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:55.920]   But how do you quantify that value?
[00:31:55.920 --> 00:31:57.440]   Yeah, and how do you quantify that value?
[00:31:57.440 --> 00:31:59.200]   I mean, and how long does Facebook's values
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:02.360]   last if the kids decide to go to something else?
[00:32:02.360 --> 00:32:03.760]   About five minutes.
[00:32:03.760 --> 00:32:04.600]   Yeah.
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:06.200]   It's a gambling valuation.
[00:32:06.200 --> 00:32:07.960]   I have a question for you people,
[00:32:07.960 --> 00:32:10.880]   because you go to shows, I no longer do.
[00:32:10.880 --> 00:32:15.320]   I used to get excited about going to a convex
[00:32:15.320 --> 00:32:18.920]   where we saw new technology, and I was involved
[00:32:18.920 --> 00:32:23.160]   in awarding the best in show and best technology award
[00:32:23.160 --> 00:32:23.920]   and things.
[00:32:23.920 --> 00:32:27.080]   Is there any show like that nowadays that's worth going to?
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   Long pause.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   I think--
[00:32:32.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   Hello?
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:37.400]   I think maybe you get sort of declining returns
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:38.600]   after you go to a lot of them.
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:40.920]   But I mean, if I was beginning to cover this space,
[00:32:40.920 --> 00:32:45.800]   I think I'd get a lot out of conferences like Web 2.0.
[00:32:45.800 --> 00:32:48.280]   You know, CES, I find a couple of days at CES,
[00:32:48.280 --> 00:32:50.800]   and of course, all the Apple events are always worthwhile.
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:55.360]   But as we said earlier, it's kind of meeting people
[00:32:55.360 --> 00:32:56.560]   and making those connections.
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:32:59.640]   Those at conferences, that's always the big value.
[00:32:59.640 --> 00:33:02.120]   And after you've been doing it for a while,
[00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:04.160]   it's just kind of declining returns.
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:06.800]   By the way, I am the only human being
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:10.480]   who went to every damn convex.
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:12.120]   And thank God they put it out of business,
[00:33:12.120 --> 00:33:13.680]   or Jerry, you'd still be going.
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:15.320]   I'd still be going.
[00:33:15.320 --> 00:33:17.760]   I'd still be giving the best of show awards.
[00:33:17.760 --> 00:33:19.000]   Oh, lower.
[00:33:19.000 --> 00:33:21.280]   Shelley's doing OK, though.
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:22.680]   He's done very well with himself.
[00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:25.040]   Well, Sheldon did very well, but he's sold out.
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:27.240]   Sheldon didn't go to the last four comedies.
[00:33:27.240 --> 00:33:29.680]   Yeah, no, he got out just at the right time.
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:30.720]   Isn't he?
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:32.320]   And I think he's building a new hotel.
[00:33:32.320 --> 00:33:33.360]   The other day.
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:35.880]   Yeah, Sheldon got hurt very badly the other day.
[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:36.240]   Oh, dude.
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:37.760]   He fell off his wallet.
[00:33:37.760 --> 00:33:39.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:42.080]   He has the Venetian, the Sands.
[00:33:42.080 --> 00:33:43.080]   He's a billionaire.
[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:44.280]   I think he's in the list now.
[00:33:44.280 --> 00:33:45.560]   The Forbes list.
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:47.080]   He's done very well for himself.
[00:33:47.080 --> 00:33:48.520]   He was--
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:51.520]   Did he start comedex or just acquire it?
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:52.720]   Jerry?
[00:33:52.720 --> 00:33:53.160]   Anybody?
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:53.760]   He was Jerry.
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:54.640]   We lost Jerry.
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:55.640]   He's going to get him back there.
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:56.640]   Oh, there he goes.
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:57.320]   Oh, yeah.
[00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:58.560]   He fell off his wallet.
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:00.720]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:34:00.720 --> 00:34:01.720]   I love that.
[00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:02.520]   I was worried.
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:04.800]   I thought, oh my god, Sheldon, something happened to him.
[00:34:04.800 --> 00:34:06.120]   I'm calling him right now.
[00:34:06.120 --> 00:34:06.800]   He fell offline.
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:09.320]   We'll keep going, and I'll get him back on it in a second.
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:11.040]   I was going to tell him, though, that if he's
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:14.040]   looking to get back into going to something that might be
[00:34:14.040 --> 00:34:15.480]   worthwhile and interesting for him,
[00:34:15.480 --> 00:34:19.440]   I always like Tony Perkins always on Innovation Summit,
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:20.840]   which is by no means Condex.
[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:23.360]   It doesn't focus on consumer electronics
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:25.080]   or really hardware at all.
[00:34:25.080 --> 00:34:28.800]   It's much more sort of services oriented.
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:30.920]   But it's always interesting, and he gets great speakers,
[00:34:30.920 --> 00:34:33.040]   and again, good hallway vibes.
[00:34:33.040 --> 00:34:36.840]   And I think all the video for that for previous years
[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:38.080]   is archived on the web.
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:40.880]   What do you guys think about the little ones, the anti-conferences,
[00:34:40.880 --> 00:34:45.240]   the bar caps, the unconferences?
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:45.920]   Love those.
[00:34:45.920 --> 00:34:48.520]   I think to me, that's where the most interesting people
[00:34:48.520 --> 00:34:50.680]   are going, and it might be what's happening at the big
[00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:52.640]   conferences like TechCrunch and Web 2.0,
[00:34:52.640 --> 00:34:55.040]   is that they're being kind of avoided
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:57.800]   by the most innovative, most interesting people.
[00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:59.720]   Jerry, can you hear us now?
[00:34:59.720 --> 00:35:02.800]   He's on, but he's not hearing us, I guess.
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.800]   Brad, you probably have to go to all of these events.
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:07.840]   Well, I think they don't want us to stray too far
[00:35:07.840 --> 00:35:10.120]   from our desk and from the daily paper.
[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:12.440]   So I actually have to sort of pick strategically
[00:35:12.440 --> 00:35:14.120]   what I do go to.
[00:35:14.120 --> 00:35:14.560]   There we go.
[00:35:14.560 --> 00:35:17.040]   We've got Jerry back now.
[00:35:17.040 --> 00:35:19.320]   Also, they got us blogging now.
[00:35:19.320 --> 00:35:21.880]   So if I go to a conference, I actually
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:24.480]   have to produce some blogging.
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:26.160]   That takes most of the fun out of the conferences.
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:27.840]   When you actually have to work them.
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:28.480]   It really does.
[00:35:28.480 --> 00:35:30.400]   You can't really enjoy yourself.
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:30.760]   I don't know.
[00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:32.200]   That's kind of why I go to conferences.
[00:35:32.200 --> 00:35:33.760]   I love to go to conferences and blog them.
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:36.560]   But then, again, I'm not working for the New York Times.
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:37.920]   Jerry, can you hear us now?
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:39.120]   I hear you.
[00:35:39.120 --> 00:35:40.080]   Do you hear me?
[00:35:40.080 --> 00:35:40.720]   We do.
[00:35:40.720 --> 00:35:42.360]   I think it's all back to go.
[00:35:42.360 --> 00:35:43.400]   OK.
[00:35:43.400 --> 00:35:46.200]   I got a thing from Vesta saying, do you
[00:35:46.200 --> 00:35:47.600]   want to know what happened?
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:48.120]   Yeah, right.
[00:35:48.120 --> 00:35:50.920]   And Microsoft informed me that Skype
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:52.800]   was it with all Skype's fault.
[00:35:52.800 --> 00:35:54.160]   Yeah, of course.
[00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:56.240]   You know, I love that thing.
[00:35:56.240 --> 00:35:57.680]   In fact, Vesta will come back now.
[00:35:57.680 --> 00:36:00.240]   If it doesn't-- if it can't, quote, resolve the issue,
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:02.920]   resolution, by the way, is see if there's a nowhere version.
[00:36:02.920 --> 00:36:06.640]   But if it can't resolve it, it will come back in a few weeks.
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:08.800]   And Vesta will say, you know, you still have some unresolved
[00:36:08.800 --> 00:36:09.160]   issues.
[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:11.120]   Would you like me to check now?
[00:36:11.120 --> 00:36:14.320]   It is the most helpful but completely useless tool
[00:36:14.320 --> 00:36:16.680]   I've ever seen.
[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:20.480]   I have Vesta on the machine I'm talking to you with.
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:21.680]   And I really shouldn't.
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:24.720]   I really should have used Xt.
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:26.280]   And you're a little hot, Jerry, if you can--
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:27.920]   I don't know if you have control of your level,
[00:36:27.920 --> 00:36:31.520]   but if you can cut it a little bit, that would help us.
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:32.320]   I'll try.
[00:36:32.320 --> 00:36:33.600]   Does that help?
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:34.320]   No.
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:36.080]   It went the wrong way.
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:36.680]   Did it?
[00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:37.920]   Yeah.
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:38.400]   That's all right.
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:39.240]   We can live with it.
[00:36:39.240 --> 00:36:40.120]   It's not awful.
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:45.640]   And I have tools to mix this down later.
[00:36:45.640 --> 00:36:48.560]   So we're not going to go to any more conferences.
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:49.480]   That's resolved.
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:51.280]   We're just going to stay here in our little rooms.
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:53.560]   And the truth is, now this would de Vorac has said for a while,
[00:36:53.560 --> 00:36:54.760]   you don't really need to anymore.
[00:36:54.760 --> 00:36:57.200]   You could just watch from afar.
[00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:58.200]   There's so much coverage.
[00:36:58.200 --> 00:36:59.760]   Everything is so over-covered nowadays.
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:01.560]   You could just watch from afar.
[00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:03.920]   That's what I plan to do from now on.
[00:37:03.920 --> 00:37:06.720]   Yeah, but you were talking about the small participatory--
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:07.760]   Those are fun.
[00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:11.840]   Yeah, those you, I think, really get a lot out of them,
[00:37:11.840 --> 00:37:14.200]   both as a speaker and as an attendee.
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:15.360]   I like the unconference.
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:17.040]   I haven't been to one, but I just love the idea
[00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.360]   that there is no presenters.
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:20.640]   You're all part of the conference.
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:23.600]   Yeah, I was watching the World Series of Poker the other day.
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:27.680]   And they had a lot of ads for, surprisingly, poker sites.
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:30.600]   And each one of them said, this is not a poker site.
[00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:33.360]   We won't take your money.
[00:37:33.360 --> 00:37:36.280]   The World Trade Organization now says,
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:38.680]   we want billions of dollars in compensation
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:43.840]   from the United States because of the ban on internet gambling.
[00:37:43.840 --> 00:37:47.120]   The WTO is in defense of internet gambling.
[00:37:47.120 --> 00:37:48.320]   Wow.
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:50.720]   It's kind of an amazing position there.
[00:37:50.720 --> 00:37:53.800]   Yeah.
[00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:56.560]   I guess the legal point they're making
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:38:02.440]   is that the US has reneged on commitments to the WTO.
[00:38:02.440 --> 00:38:06.600]   Antigua won a victory when the WTO ruled
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:09.400]   that the US had violated its treaty obligations
[00:38:09.400 --> 00:38:12.240]   by excluding Antiguan gaming operators
[00:38:12.240 --> 00:38:16.360]   while allowing domestic operators to continue gambling.
[00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:18.440]   So what did the Bush administration do?
[00:38:18.440 --> 00:38:21.240]   It just withdrew the whole industry.
[00:38:21.240 --> 00:38:22.560]   It said the whole thing shut down.
[00:38:22.560 --> 00:38:25.560]   And as a result, all 151 WTO members
[00:38:25.560 --> 00:38:28.000]   are considering seeking compensation
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:30.480]   equal to the size of the entire US land-based
[00:38:30.480 --> 00:38:36.040]   and online gaming market of nearly $100 billion.
[00:38:36.040 --> 00:38:37.960]   That's great.
[00:38:37.960 --> 00:38:41.920]   But this is not, we want to point out a poker podcast.
[00:38:41.920 --> 00:38:44.520]   I guess the money's not going to stay in Vegas then.
[00:38:44.520 --> 00:38:45.520]   Yeah.
[00:38:45.520 --> 00:38:46.520]   What happens?
[00:38:46.520 --> 00:38:49.160]   What's earned in Vegas stays in Vegas.
[00:38:49.160 --> 00:38:50.160]   You know, it's funny.
[00:38:50.160 --> 00:38:52.040]   I wonder because I look at these ads
[00:38:52.040 --> 00:38:54.560]   and if they're not taking any money
[00:38:54.560 --> 00:38:55.640]   and they're not doing any gambling,
[00:38:55.640 --> 00:38:57.360]   then what are these sites doing?
[00:38:57.360 --> 00:38:58.440]   There must be somehow.
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:01.040]   Well, yeah, they're all the partner sites
[00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:02.640]   of the real gambling sites.
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:06.520]   So I forget all the names and there are a lot of them.
[00:39:06.520 --> 00:39:07.280]   But if it's--
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:08.680]   Let's say party poker dot.
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:09.840]   Yeah, party poker.
[00:39:09.840 --> 00:39:10.840]   What are they advertising?
[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:12.000]   Party poker dot net.
[00:39:12.000 --> 00:39:13.160]   That's the free site.
[00:39:13.160 --> 00:39:15.400]   And then, of course, you make the jump to party poker
[00:39:15.400 --> 00:39:15.920]   dot.
[00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:18.080]   But how if you're a US citizen?
[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:20.520]   Well, I don't think do they block you from party poker dot
[00:39:20.520 --> 00:39:21.360]   com?
[00:39:21.360 --> 00:39:23.840]   No, but I think you can't use your credit card.
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:24.840]   I don't know.
[00:39:24.840 --> 00:39:25.520]   That's right.
[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:26.640]   I think you can't use your credit.
[00:39:26.640 --> 00:39:30.480]   I mean, basically, so traditional gambling interests
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:36.040]   have forced the government to outlaw this internet poker.
[00:39:36.040 --> 00:39:39.520]   All the enterprises went overseas.
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:40.360]   The media--
[00:39:40.360 --> 00:39:42.200]   They're all in Antigua, apparently.
[00:39:42.200 --> 00:39:44.760]   They're not supposed to accept advertising
[00:39:44.760 --> 00:39:46.160]   from the poker company.
[00:39:46.160 --> 00:39:48.240]   So you have this ridiculous arrangement.
[00:39:48.240 --> 00:39:49.320]   I just love it.
[00:39:49.320 --> 00:39:51.800]   And then anybody that does want to gamble on these sites
[00:39:51.800 --> 00:39:55.040]   will figure out a way to get around it.
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:39:57.320]   It's like Jerry was saying.
[00:39:57.320 --> 00:40:00.240]   The law currently doesn't reflect practice.
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:02.040]   Well, the law is there to protect Atlantic City
[00:40:02.040 --> 00:40:04.640]   and Las Vegas is what the law is really there for.
[00:40:04.640 --> 00:40:07.000]   That's right, to cow tow to powerful interest.
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   And if they're trying to accomplish something
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.240]   and anti-gambling, true anti-gambling initiatives,
[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:16.720]   they're certainly failing on that part.
[00:40:16.720 --> 00:40:21.880]   Big week for PC manufacturers, according to--
[00:40:21.880 --> 00:40:23.680]   I guess it was Gartner.
[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:24.720]   Maybe it was IDG.
[00:40:24.720 --> 00:40:27.160]   Yeah, I'm sorry, IDC.
[00:40:27.160 --> 00:40:31.360]   PC sales, the fastest rate in two years,
[00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:35.520]   sales of portable computers driving much of the increase
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:37.480]   in global sales, especially in Europe,
[00:40:37.480 --> 00:40:41.040]   15.5% increase.
[00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:46.160]   Dell doing well, but HP pulled ahead.
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:48.400]   And Apple, surprisingly, doing very well.
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:51.560]   In fact, Apple outpacing both HP and Dell.
[00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:54.000]   Now Apple, now the number three computer manufacturer
[00:40:54.000 --> 00:40:56.520]   in the US, and something like--
[00:40:56.520 --> 00:40:59.480]   depending on who you listen to, a 32% increase
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:02.280]   in computer sales over the last quarter.
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:02.760]   Why are--
[00:41:02.760 --> 00:41:04.640]   Why are so many people buying computers?
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:05.360]   Go ahead, Denise.
[00:41:05.360 --> 00:41:06.240]   I'm sorry, I didn't interrupt you.
[00:41:06.240 --> 00:41:07.500]   I was going to ask if anybody caught
[00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:10.240]   Hallie Berry on the Tonight Show the other night,
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:11.280]   plugging her Mac.
[00:41:11.280 --> 00:41:15.440]   And she was using Photo Booth to take funny pictures of herself,
[00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:18.560]   which she then gave Jay Leno how they--
[00:41:18.560 --> 00:41:21.040]   Did she actually bring the Mac on stage with her?
[00:41:21.040 --> 00:41:22.400]   No, no, but she brought the picture
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:25.280]   she had printed that had distorted her face in crazy ways.
[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:27.320]   I think Photo Booth has probably sold more Mac
[00:41:27.320 --> 00:41:31.080]   and Tasha's than any application since Lotus 1, 2, 3.
[00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:32.440]   It's a visit count.
[00:41:32.440 --> 00:41:33.920]   It's kind of amazing.
[00:41:33.920 --> 00:41:35.840]   As you were saying this, it just
[00:41:35.840 --> 00:41:39.360]   occurs to me that do you know anybody who really doesn't even
[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:41.120]   consider buying a Mac for home use
[00:41:41.120 --> 00:41:43.600]   if you're going to buy a home computer?
[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:44.080]   I think that--
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:44.520]   Look what I know.
[00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:47.280]   But oddly enough, whenever I talk about this,
[00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:50.280]   especially on the radio show, which is kind of a national thing,
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:54.680]   I get a lot of email from people saying 90%, 98% of all users
[00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:56.720]   not only use Windows but love Windows.
[00:41:56.720 --> 00:41:57.440]   You're crazy.
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:41:59.280]   What does all this Mac talk?
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:01.760]   You drank the Kool-Aid.
[00:42:01.760 --> 00:42:04.680]   Yeah, I don't get all the surge and growth.
[00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:07.320]   I mean, unless everything was kind of on a time bomb
[00:42:07.320 --> 00:42:09.400]   and all the old equipment just died.
[00:42:09.400 --> 00:42:10.160]   You know, I mean--
[00:42:10.160 --> 00:42:11.280]   Well, some of it's Vista.
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:12.560]   But I have to say, I think there's
[00:42:12.560 --> 00:42:14.200]   a huge backlash against Vista.
[00:42:14.200 --> 00:42:16.280]   Look at-- I mean, Jerry, look at what you just said.
[00:42:16.280 --> 00:42:18.560]   I mean, every journalist I talk to
[00:42:18.560 --> 00:42:21.800]   is starting to say things like, God, I hate Vista.
[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:24.320]   But I wonder, are those Dell and HP sales summers?
[00:42:24.320 --> 00:42:27.000]   Do they reflect Vista sales?
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.720]   Well, Dell actually sells XP.
[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:31.720]   I don't-- they didn't break it down by operating system.
[00:42:31.720 --> 00:42:34.480]   But if PC sales are up this quarter,
[00:42:34.480 --> 00:42:39.880]   it has to be because there was pent up demand before Vista came out.
[00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:42.360]   And people were waiting for Vista to come out.
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:44.000]   And maybe they were waiting for Vista
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:46.800]   to be a little more mature, and now they're buying.
[00:42:46.800 --> 00:42:48.840]   I think some of the success Apple's having, of course,
[00:42:48.840 --> 00:42:52.120]   is a halo effect from the iPod and the iPhone.
[00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:52.960]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:42:52.960 --> 00:42:57.320]   People get used to such a good experience on those devices,
[00:42:57.320 --> 00:42:58.600]   and they come to expect it.
[00:42:58.600 --> 00:42:59.520]   I like my iPhone.
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:00.640]   I like my iPod.
[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:02.120]   Let's take a look at a Macintosh.
[00:43:02.120 --> 00:43:04.160]   Apple dropped the other shoe on the iPhone.
[00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:05.400]   This was actually big news.
[00:43:05.400 --> 00:43:07.760]   They say in February, they're going to release an SDK,
[00:43:07.760 --> 00:43:10.120]   and third-party apps will be allowed on the iPhone.
[00:43:10.120 --> 00:43:12.200]   But if the SDK comes out in February,
[00:43:12.200 --> 00:43:13.800]   it's going to take a few months to develop,
[00:43:13.800 --> 00:43:15.280]   you're going to-- it's going to be till June,
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:16.600]   or maybe even this time next year,
[00:43:16.600 --> 00:43:19.040]   before you start seeing these applications.
[00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:21.760]   I wonder why it took them so long to--
[00:43:21.760 --> 00:43:24.040]   to say, you know, their first instinct was obviously
[00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:27.360]   to squash that larger developer ecosystem.
[00:43:27.360 --> 00:43:29.280]   But of course, it's great for the iPhone.
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:30.040]   Yeah, dumb move.
[00:43:30.040 --> 00:43:32.040]   It's the same way it's been great for Facebook.
[00:43:32.040 --> 00:43:32.320]   Right.
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:33.320]   I don't understand it.
[00:43:33.320 --> 00:43:33.840]   Yeah.
[00:43:33.840 --> 00:43:36.800]   In fact, if you look at-- just on a small scale,
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:40.320]   if you look at these microblogging sites,
[00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:42.720]   the ones that do APIs, get all this development.
[00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:43.960]   I'm looking at Jaiku and Twitter.
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:44.760]   Just look what Twitter did.
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:45.880]   They had an API.
[00:43:45.880 --> 00:43:48.160]   And more software was written for Twitter
[00:43:48.160 --> 00:43:50.640]   by people who don't even gain anything from it,
[00:43:50.640 --> 00:43:53.880]   just for fun, just because they had an API.
[00:43:53.880 --> 00:43:56.080]   There's a lot of people out there, if they love you,
[00:43:56.080 --> 00:43:57.960]   if they love the iPhone, want to develop for it.
[00:43:57.960 --> 00:44:00.800]   I don't understand why Apple would be so reluctant.
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:03.240]   Steve Jobs says it's for security.
[00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:06.720]   He says, we want to develop this as a secure platform
[00:44:06.720 --> 00:44:07.720]   from the ground up.
[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:11.320]   He believes that cell phones will be the next big target
[00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:12.720]   for hackers.
[00:44:12.720 --> 00:44:16.520]   And he doesn't want the iPhone to be a platform for them.
[00:44:16.520 --> 00:44:19.240]   But I have to point out, every other smartphone
[00:44:19.240 --> 00:44:21.600]   supports third party applications.
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:25.760]   Yeah, I don't get the security concern from an app.
[00:44:25.760 --> 00:44:27.840]   I mean, I guess it could be a virus.
[00:44:27.840 --> 00:44:29.120]   Well, yeah.
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:31.120]   But part of the problem-- somebody pointed out to me,
[00:44:31.120 --> 00:44:32.640]   I think this is true is that the iPhone,
[00:44:32.640 --> 00:44:35.000]   we're getting a little off tangent here.
[00:44:35.000 --> 00:44:35.720]   They're a little geeky.
[00:44:35.720 --> 00:44:37.560]   I know this panel is not set to talk about this.
[00:44:37.560 --> 00:44:40.640]   But the iPhone, you run in root mode,
[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:42.440]   which is not a good security policy.
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:44.120]   That means any application on the iPhone
[00:44:44.120 --> 00:44:46.560]   has absolute access to everything else on the iPhone.
[00:44:46.560 --> 00:44:48.240]   It can, in fact, hack it.
[00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:51.120]   So I guess that's-- it was written in secure.
[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:53.040]   My feeling is that the iPhone--
[00:44:53.040 --> 00:44:54.720]   That's how it was so readily hacked then?
[00:44:54.720 --> 00:44:56.400]   Yes, exactly.
[00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:59.160]   My feeling is the iPhone was rushed to release.
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:00.560]   And it really isn't a finished product.
[00:45:00.560 --> 00:45:03.440]   In fact, the next generation iPhone will be 1.0.
[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:05.640]   This was a beta test.
[00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:07.520]   And right about when these apps come out,
[00:45:07.520 --> 00:45:09.680]   that's when you're going to see the next generation.
[00:45:09.680 --> 00:45:10.760]   That'll be the real iPhone.
[00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:13.760]   This was just a test, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:15.440]   Yeah, it's a good test.
[00:45:15.440 --> 00:45:15.920]   I'm still--
[00:45:15.920 --> 00:45:16.400]   Do you have one?
[00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:16.840]   --of mine?
[00:45:16.840 --> 00:45:18.040]   Yeah, I do.
[00:45:18.040 --> 00:45:22.480]   I'm looking forward to Google getting their hands on the SDK
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:26.200]   and writing a Gmail app that works as well as their Gmail
[00:45:26.200 --> 00:45:27.920]   app for other mobile phones.
[00:45:27.920 --> 00:45:32.320]   That was, by the way, the big story this week was the Gphone,
[00:45:32.320 --> 00:45:33.400]   the Google phone.
[00:45:33.400 --> 00:45:35.400]   I've got a lot of people asking me about that,
[00:45:35.400 --> 00:45:37.160]   including a number of business journals.
[00:45:37.160 --> 00:45:38.880]   I guess, because CTIA is coming up,
[00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:41.640]   and there's some thought, I don't think it seems possible,
[00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:43.720]   that Google might be announcing a Gphone.
[00:45:43.720 --> 00:45:45.520]   Brad, do you think that that's the case?
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:46.120]   Do you hear anything?
[00:45:46.120 --> 00:45:49.280]   Well, I think I don't cover Google,
[00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:51.720]   but the paper's written about it a couple times.
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:56.280]   And I think we're going to see something by the end of the year.
[00:45:56.280 --> 00:45:59.760]   You know, it seems that I guess it's partly
[00:45:59.760 --> 00:46:03.000]   a kind of relationship with several handset manufacturers,
[00:46:03.000 --> 00:46:06.920]   and of course, an effort to deliver ads to a mobile phone.
[00:46:06.920 --> 00:46:09.840]   Not something I'm personally all that excited about.
[00:46:09.840 --> 00:46:11.600]   Seems like location-based advertising,
[00:46:11.600 --> 00:46:15.240]   though, is a prime place for Google to play.
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:16.480]   Yeah, it makes a lot of sense.
[00:46:16.480 --> 00:46:18.280]   You're walking down the street and it says, hey,
[00:46:18.280 --> 00:46:21.560]   there's a pizza-- I know you happen to like pizza a lot,
[00:46:21.560 --> 00:46:24.640]   and the best pizza in town is just around the corner.
[00:46:24.640 --> 00:46:27.840]   That's an ad that you'd want to buy.
[00:46:27.840 --> 00:46:29.360]   And that you're driving at the time,
[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:31.960]   and if the ad comes through, you veer your car in the car.
[00:46:31.960 --> 00:46:34.440]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:36.360]   Like Michael Scott, you drive into the lake.
[00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:39.880]   But the phone told me to.
[00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:43.920]   Yeah, maybe it's not such a good idea.
[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:45.640]   I haven't had a chance to talk to either of you,
[00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:47.760]   and by the way, Jerry's fallen off again.
[00:46:47.760 --> 00:46:49.120]   Vista probably crashed on him.
[00:46:49.120 --> 00:46:50.680]   We'll get him back as soon as we can.
[00:46:50.680 --> 00:46:52.960]   But Denise and Brad, I'm curious what you think
[00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:56.400]   about the spectrum auctions next year,
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:58.920]   and Google's announced intent to participate in those.
[00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:02.400]   What does Google want with the 700 megahertz spectrum?
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:04.880]   Well, I think they want to crack the stranglehold
[00:47:04.880 --> 00:47:07.040]   of the wireless carriers.
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:09.480]   Do they want to be a cell carrier themselves?
[00:47:09.480 --> 00:47:10.240]   I doubt it.
[00:47:10.240 --> 00:47:13.960]   But they want to open it up to innovation,
[00:47:13.960 --> 00:47:18.640]   and let developers play there, and create
[00:47:18.640 --> 00:47:23.040]   the range of new services and devices,
[00:47:23.040 --> 00:47:25.200]   the kind of innovation that we see online now
[00:47:25.200 --> 00:47:29.880]   bring that to the cell phone environment.
[00:47:29.880 --> 00:47:32.400]   I think it's just kind of defensive,
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:35.560]   and keeping it out of the hands of the big carriers.
[00:47:35.560 --> 00:47:38.280]   Wouldn't you, Denise, like an iPhone,
[00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:41.480]   if you didn't have to pay AT&T, it
[00:47:41.480 --> 00:47:44.840]   worked on a wireless network that was ubiquitous and high
[00:47:44.840 --> 00:47:45.600]   speed.
[00:47:45.600 --> 00:47:46.640]   It had VoIP on it.
[00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:50.760]   Maybe it had Skype or something like Skype on it.
[00:47:50.760 --> 00:47:52.200]   And maybe you even got it for free,
[00:47:52.200 --> 00:47:54.400]   because Google subsidized it, because every once in a while
[00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:55.640]   you were going to see an ad.
[00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:59.480]   That seems to me like a reasonable business.
[00:47:59.480 --> 00:48:01.840]   That's what we call in the legal profession a leading
[00:48:01.840 --> 00:48:05.840]   question, and the answer is, of course, absolutely.
[00:48:05.840 --> 00:48:06.920]   And that's why I don't--
[00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:08.280]   I, be honest with you, the reason I ask that,
[00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:10.480]   that's my problem with the iPhone is I'm so limited.
[00:48:10.480 --> 00:48:11.720]   I don't want to be with AT&T.
[00:48:11.720 --> 00:48:13.800]   I don't want to pay them all this money.
[00:48:13.800 --> 00:48:16.240]   I don't want to be able to put third party applications.
[00:48:16.240 --> 00:48:17.720]   I want those kind of freedoms.
[00:48:17.720 --> 00:48:20.960]   And the iPhone just big screams that kind of freedom.
[00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:21.880]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:48:21.880 --> 00:48:26.320]   And yeah, the Edge network is sort of the iPhones one big
[00:48:26.320 --> 00:48:26.840]   downfall.
[00:48:26.840 --> 00:48:28.120]   Oh, not awful, yeah.
[00:48:28.120 --> 00:48:29.440]   And I can see--
[00:48:29.440 --> 00:48:31.680]   Jerry's back, ladies and gentlemen.
[00:48:31.680 --> 00:48:32.800]   Yes, hello.
[00:48:32.800 --> 00:48:34.760]   Are you still on Vista?
[00:48:34.760 --> 00:48:37.640]   Unfortunately, and you can name Blame the Law.
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:39.280]   I had to reset the machine.
[00:48:39.280 --> 00:48:42.480]   And of course, Vista sort of takes a small lifetime
[00:48:42.480 --> 00:48:43.240]   to reset.
[00:48:43.240 --> 00:48:44.400]   I hate Vista.
[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:46.000]   I really hate Vista.
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:48.800]   Now, you've used every version of Windows since 1.0,
[00:48:48.800 --> 00:48:49.840]   probably, Jerry.
[00:48:49.840 --> 00:48:50.840]   I have.
[00:48:50.840 --> 00:48:54.880]   And would you say it's certainly not the worst version ever?
[00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:56.480]   No, ME was worse.
[00:48:56.480 --> 00:48:57.600]   Yeah, that's not the same much.
[00:48:57.600 --> 00:48:59.280]   Other than ME.
[00:48:59.280 --> 00:48:59.800]   Wow.
[00:48:59.800 --> 00:49:03.480]   The problem with Vista is when it works, it works very well.
[00:49:03.480 --> 00:49:03.960]   Yeah.
[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:05.480]   And it's really pretty.
[00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:07.120]   And it's got lots of neat things.
[00:49:07.120 --> 00:49:09.000]   And I love this moonscape.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:12.280]   But great, heavens.
[00:49:12.280 --> 00:49:15.200]   For instance, this last time I was on,
[00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:19.520]   I could hear you, but it kept telling me microphone is muted.
[00:49:19.520 --> 00:49:20.000]   Yeah.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:23.240]   And I couldn't find anything that would let me turn it back on
[00:49:23.240 --> 00:49:24.280]   again.
[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:28.120]   Vista seems to have its most trouble with audio and video.
[00:49:28.120 --> 00:49:31.480]   And I have to think that I'd wrote a--
[00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:34.200]   I think a very good and pretty damning article
[00:49:34.200 --> 00:49:37.320]   about Peter Goodman's piece about copy protection in Vista
[00:49:37.320 --> 00:49:39.320]   saying, now Goodman was all wrong.
[00:49:39.320 --> 00:49:42.080]   However, I have to think that copy protection in Vista
[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:44.520]   has something to do with the fact that it has miserable time
[00:49:44.520 --> 00:49:45.960]   with audio and video.
[00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:48.200]   You think that's it?
[00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:49.200]   I have to think so.
[00:49:49.200 --> 00:49:53.080]   I think that because they lock down stuff--
[00:49:53.080 --> 00:49:55.120]   And there's just a lot of code going on
[00:49:55.120 --> 00:49:56.240]   to accomplish all of that.
[00:49:56.240 --> 00:49:56.840]   Yeah, you're right.
[00:49:56.840 --> 00:49:58.560]   There's always stuff going on in the background.
[00:49:58.560 --> 00:50:00.040]   Yeah.
[00:50:00.040 --> 00:50:01.320]   Go ahead, Jerry.
[00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:04.480]   Oh, I always going to say digital rights management
[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:08.240]   generally seems to do more harm than good in the sense
[00:50:08.240 --> 00:50:11.400]   that it irritates paying customers without doing a heck
[00:50:11.400 --> 00:50:13.480]   of a lot of good to protect you from pirates.
[00:50:13.480 --> 00:50:14.920]   So I point exactly.
[00:50:14.920 --> 00:50:18.280]   The only people at Thwarts are people who are honest.
[00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:21.200]   Everybody else just gets right around it.
[00:50:21.200 --> 00:50:24.280]   That does seem to be the case.
[00:50:24.280 --> 00:50:26.000]   But good news, the record companies
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:28.520]   have figured out a way to get you back into the store.
[00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:34.360]   They've decided that the CD is not as cool as it used to be.
[00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:37.040]   Universal, Warner, and EMI are going
[00:50:37.040 --> 00:50:39.760]   to start selling music on flash drives.
[00:50:39.760 --> 00:50:40.680]   Oh, my.
[00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:41.840]   That's crazy.
[00:50:41.840 --> 00:50:43.160]   I thought you were going to tell me
[00:50:43.160 --> 00:50:44.800]   they were going back to vinyl.
[00:50:44.800 --> 00:50:45.240]   Really?
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:46.200]   No, I would.
[00:50:46.200 --> 00:50:47.760]   Now I would go for that.
[00:50:47.760 --> 00:50:50.600]   But Universal says the move is aimed at the younger 12
[00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:54.120]   to 24 year olds who apparently still
[00:50:54.120 --> 00:50:58.240]   want to own a physical product but just don't want to own CDs.
[00:50:58.240 --> 00:51:00.880]   It'll be a $10 flash drive.
[00:51:00.880 --> 00:51:03.200]   It'll contain a few songs.
[00:51:03.200 --> 00:51:04.640]   It'll be like a CD single.
[00:51:04.640 --> 00:51:06.000]   Maybe you'll have a wringle on it.
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:11.280]   That's a CD ringtone and some additional content.
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:12.440]   And a USB drive.
[00:51:12.440 --> 00:51:13.200]   What a terrible--
[00:51:13.200 --> 00:51:15.400]   Our landfills just won't be able to handle this.
[00:51:15.400 --> 00:51:16.600]   A terrible idea.
[00:51:16.600 --> 00:51:18.280]   Is that BRM protected music?
[00:51:18.280 --> 00:51:19.600]   Oh, of course it is.
[00:51:19.600 --> 00:51:20.280]   It's got to be.
[00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:23.800]   You wouldn't give out a flash drive if you could copy it.
[00:51:23.800 --> 00:51:26.680]   Is it going to have in the package also
[00:51:26.680 --> 00:51:28.800]   all the album cover material or--
[00:51:28.800 --> 00:51:29.960]   Well, maybe, yeah.
[00:51:29.960 --> 00:51:33.400]   That's one thing I do miss from vinyl records
[00:51:33.400 --> 00:51:35.400]   is those big album covers.
[00:51:35.400 --> 00:51:36.680]   Yeah, they were beautiful.
[00:51:36.680 --> 00:51:38.160]   I love to look at them.
[00:51:38.160 --> 00:51:41.240]   You put your headphones on, you read the lyrics
[00:51:41.240 --> 00:51:42.760]   from the liner notes.
[00:51:42.760 --> 00:51:43.200]   Try that.
[00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:46.480]   We can't even do that with a CD, let alone a download.
[00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:49.000]   Jerry, we're starting to sound like old guys.
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.600]   Well, maybe.
[00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:54.280]   You guys were talking about iPhones a minute ago.
[00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:55.880]   Yes, you missed that conversation.
[00:51:55.880 --> 00:51:56.320]   Yes.
[00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:57.560]   Well, I know I didn't miss it.
[00:51:57.560 --> 00:51:58.120]   I heard it.
[00:51:58.120 --> 00:51:59.160]   I just didn't get it.
[00:51:59.160 --> 00:51:59.960]   And he missed you.
[00:51:59.960 --> 00:52:02.120]   Yeah.
[00:52:02.120 --> 00:52:05.680]   I think the next iteration of the iPhone
[00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:09.720]   may be the beginning of the end for the paperback book
[00:52:09.720 --> 00:52:10.720]   business.
[00:52:10.720 --> 00:52:12.240]   Oh, really?
[00:52:12.240 --> 00:52:13.880]   Think about it.
[00:52:13.880 --> 00:52:18.240]   Nobody right now or very few people right now go out
[00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:22.720]   and buy a book reader to read a book on.
[00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:23.560]   I bought two.
[00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:24.200]   I'm sorry to say.
[00:52:24.200 --> 00:52:26.800]   Yeah, I mean, people do, but they don't even--
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:28.720]   No, I know I'm in a minority.
[00:52:28.720 --> 00:52:29.120]   Yeah, no.
[00:52:29.120 --> 00:52:31.200]   And you're a very much minority.
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:33.720]   But if you're already carrying something--
[00:52:33.720 --> 00:52:34.720]   True, true.
[00:52:34.720 --> 00:52:37.520]   --that is good enough to read a book on,
[00:52:37.520 --> 00:52:39.480]   now you're in an airport.
[00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:40.560]   You have your choice.
[00:52:40.560 --> 00:52:43.120]   You can Wi-Fi the latest--
[00:52:43.120 --> 00:52:45.160]   well, I don't know, Harry Potter novel,
[00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:48.920]   or let's be optimistic and say my latest novel.
[00:52:48.920 --> 00:52:52.960]   And you can get it by Wi-Fi for $6.95 or something.
[00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:57.480]   Or you can buy a copy there in the airport bookstore
[00:52:57.480 --> 00:52:59.920]   for $8.95 as a paperback, right?
[00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:00.400]   Right.
[00:53:00.400 --> 00:53:01.960]   But you're already carrying something.
[00:53:01.960 --> 00:53:04.320]   Why would you carry something else?
[00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:08.040]   I think the paperback book industry is already in trouble.
[00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:10.000]   Well, that's why I bought the Sony Ring.
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:13.440]   I bought the first Sony reader, and I just bought the new one.
[00:53:13.440 --> 00:53:14.200]   How do you like it?
[00:53:14.200 --> 00:53:15.880]   I actually like it a lot.
[00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:18.640]   What you really want is paper white with black black text.
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:20.640]   And the contrast is not quite there.
[00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:22.160]   But it's close.
[00:53:22.160 --> 00:53:23.040]   And Jerry, I can--
[00:53:23.040 --> 00:53:23.440]   It's getting there.
[00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:24.520]   Yeah, it's getting there.
[00:53:24.520 --> 00:53:27.320]   It's got like 192 megs of storage built in,
[00:53:27.320 --> 00:53:29.040]   and you can add an SD card.
[00:53:29.040 --> 00:53:31.880]   So it's based-- I mean, it's hundreds of novels in there.
[00:53:31.880 --> 00:53:35.520]   We're also getting an Amazon Kindle soon.
[00:53:35.520 --> 00:53:37.760]   Oh, Amazon's going to do one?
[00:53:37.760 --> 00:53:40.480]   My-- yep, and I think we're going to see it this year.
[00:53:40.480 --> 00:53:43.040]   It's called the Kindle.
[00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:46.920]   It's going to be on Sprint's EVDO network.
[00:53:46.920 --> 00:53:50.440]   And it's got a little keyboard.
[00:53:50.440 --> 00:53:52.280]   I can't wait to see it.
[00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:57.920]   The real big deal is going to be when millions of people
[00:53:57.920 --> 00:54:01.960]   are routinely already carrying something that
[00:54:01.960 --> 00:54:05.400]   is the size of a page of a paperback book anyway.
[00:54:05.400 --> 00:54:06.160]   But smaller.
[00:54:06.160 --> 00:54:07.800]   I mean, my Sony's even smaller.
[00:54:07.800 --> 00:54:08.600]   But you're right.
[00:54:08.600 --> 00:54:09.600]   And iPhone has a goodness.
[00:54:09.600 --> 00:54:11.520]   They can already read a book on it.
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:12.880]   It's in their pocket.
[00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:14.720]   And they can just buy another book
[00:54:14.720 --> 00:54:17.200]   and put it on its hard drive to read it
[00:54:17.200 --> 00:54:20.200]   as opposed to having another physical object to carry.
[00:54:20.200 --> 00:54:22.560]   When that happens, I think paperback booksail
[00:54:22.560 --> 00:54:26.280]   are going to start taking a precipitous decline, which
[00:54:26.280 --> 00:54:28.640]   is one reason why I worry about protecting
[00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:31.320]   electronic book rights.
[00:54:31.320 --> 00:54:32.240]   Not a bad thing, though.
[00:54:32.240 --> 00:54:36.120]   Eliminate the paper, eliminate the cost of distribution.
[00:54:36.120 --> 00:54:38.760]   Well, and the marketing scheme for paperback books
[00:54:38.760 --> 00:54:39.520]   is absurd.
[00:54:39.520 --> 00:54:41.480]   They ship 100,000 books.
[00:54:41.480 --> 00:54:44.440]   They sell $65,000.
[00:54:44.440 --> 00:54:47.000]   And $40,000 are pulped.
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:48.520]   Is this a whole thing?
[00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:51.480]   I swear I'm not trying to give you your lead-in
[00:54:51.480 --> 00:54:56.480]   for your audible plug with this.
[00:54:56.480 --> 00:55:01.080]   But it strikes me that I listen to so many more books now
[00:55:01.080 --> 00:55:02.480]   than I used to.
[00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:04.040]   And that eats into it as well.
[00:55:04.040 --> 00:55:05.280]   I kind of like listening to books.
[00:55:05.280 --> 00:55:06.800]   To be honest with you, I have the reader
[00:55:06.800 --> 00:55:08.240]   because I can carry a lot of books with me.
[00:55:08.240 --> 00:55:11.640]   And by the way, Jerry, it's almost all science fiction.
[00:55:11.640 --> 00:55:12.080]   So--
[00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:13.440]   There's a lot of its mind.
[00:55:13.440 --> 00:55:14.040]   Yeah, it is.
[00:55:14.040 --> 00:55:14.800]   It will be.
[00:55:14.800 --> 00:55:15.840]   As soon as the new book comes out,
[00:55:15.840 --> 00:55:17.000]   it's going to be right on there.
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.320]   And for some reason, I just like reading science fiction
[00:55:19.320 --> 00:55:21.720]   on a science fiction device like that.
[00:55:21.720 --> 00:55:23.240]   Yeah, I'm sure.
[00:55:23.240 --> 00:55:26.600]   Yes, I think a lot of my readers are earlier.
[00:55:26.600 --> 00:55:27.100]   Sure.
[00:55:27.100 --> 00:55:27.840]   They're geeks.
[00:55:27.840 --> 00:55:28.600]   You bet.
[00:55:28.600 --> 00:55:29.520]   But I do--
[00:55:29.520 --> 00:55:33.000]   And Larry Niven has never read a Harry Potter book,
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:34.480]   but he has listened to all of them.
[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:34.980]   Oh, yeah.
[00:55:34.980 --> 00:55:38.040]   Now, the question is, did he listen to Stephen Frye?
[00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:40.120]   Or did he listen to the American guy?
[00:55:40.120 --> 00:55:40.840]   Because I think--
[00:55:40.840 --> 00:55:43.040]   I think he-- he subscribes the books on tape.
[00:55:43.040 --> 00:55:44.560]   Yeah, so he got the American guy.
[00:55:44.560 --> 00:55:45.320]   Yeah, I can't remember his name.
[00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:47.080]   Stephen Frye would be much better.
[00:55:47.080 --> 00:55:48.640]   Oh, Frye was wonderful.
[00:55:48.640 --> 00:55:53.760]   And have you read his book on the technical aspect of poetry?
[00:55:53.760 --> 00:55:54.760]   No, but you know, he just--
[00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:56.560]   Frye just is apparently a big geek
[00:55:56.560 --> 00:55:57.600]   because he just--
[00:55:57.600 --> 00:55:59.640]   his new blog is up, stevenfry.com.
[00:55:59.640 --> 00:56:03.200]   And he did a big, long screed on smartphones of all things.
[00:56:03.200 --> 00:56:06.920]   Well, if you have any interest whatsoever in poetry,
[00:56:06.920 --> 00:56:10.120]   Stephen Frye's book, The Old Not Taken--
[00:56:10.120 --> 00:56:10.620]   Oh, yeah.
[00:56:10.620 --> 00:56:12.840]   --with the punt type is just wonderful.
[00:56:12.840 --> 00:56:13.200]   I'll tell you.
[00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:17.320]   It goes into every form of technical poetry ever done,
[00:56:17.320 --> 00:56:21.320]   you know, every rhyming scheme, every meter scheme.
[00:56:21.320 --> 00:56:24.640]   They're all in there with examples and discussions.
[00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:26.720]   And it's just wonderful.
[00:56:26.720 --> 00:56:30.280]   I can't imagine why there is a single poetry class
[00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:32.480]   in the country that doesn't use it for a text.
[00:56:32.480 --> 00:56:32.980]   He's a man.
[00:56:32.980 --> 00:56:33.760]   What a polymath.
[00:56:33.760 --> 00:56:34.800]   What an amazing fella.
[00:56:34.800 --> 00:56:35.600]   He really is.
[00:56:35.600 --> 00:56:36.440]   He's just wonderful.
[00:56:36.440 --> 00:56:37.200]   Yeah.
[00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:38.000]   Big fan.
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:39.400]   And Stephen, if you're listening, we want it.
[00:56:39.400 --> 00:56:40.840]   We've been trying to get him on the podcast.
[00:56:40.840 --> 00:56:43.800]   We'd love to get him on Twitch just to talk.
[00:56:43.800 --> 00:56:44.840]   So what are you listening to?
[00:56:44.840 --> 00:56:47.040]   If you get him on get me on on that one.
[00:56:47.040 --> 00:56:49.680]   I would love to tell him how much I like it stuff.
[00:56:49.680 --> 00:56:50.280]   Deal, Jerry.
[00:56:50.280 --> 00:56:51.720]   You got it.
[00:56:51.720 --> 00:56:53.040]   Denise, what are you listening to?
[00:56:53.040 --> 00:56:55.160]   We actually don't have an audible ad in this show,
[00:56:55.160 --> 00:56:57.520]   but please tell me what you're listening to right now.
[00:56:57.520 --> 00:56:59.200]   Oh, well, actually, I'm listening
[00:56:59.200 --> 00:57:00.840]   to something that came out some time ago.
[00:57:00.840 --> 00:57:03.240]   And it's John Stewart's book.
[00:57:03.240 --> 00:57:04.160]   Ah, I love him.
[00:57:04.160 --> 00:57:06.920]   In fact, that was one of our picks a few weeks ago.
[00:57:06.920 --> 00:57:07.440]   Right.
[00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:07.440]   Yeah.
[00:57:07.440 --> 00:57:09.600]   I think Paul Therat picked that.
[00:57:09.600 --> 00:57:10.080]   Yeah.
[00:57:10.080 --> 00:57:10.360]   Yeah.
[00:57:10.360 --> 00:57:10.560]   Right.
[00:57:10.560 --> 00:57:11.520]   Which is hysterical.
[00:57:11.520 --> 00:57:11.720]   Yeah.
[00:57:11.720 --> 00:57:13.240]   Of course, we're all listening to the new Stephen Colbert
[00:57:13.240 --> 00:57:14.280]   book as well.
[00:57:14.280 --> 00:57:15.640]   Oh, yeah.
[00:57:15.640 --> 00:57:16.880]   I agree with you, Jerry.
[00:57:16.880 --> 00:57:18.880]   I think that the screen on the iPhone
[00:57:18.880 --> 00:57:21.680]   is good enough that I would read stuff on there.
[00:57:21.680 --> 00:57:24.120]   In fact, I probably prefer it because it is paper white
[00:57:24.120 --> 00:57:25.920]   with black text on it.
[00:57:25.920 --> 00:57:28.120]   Now think about what happened when
[00:57:28.120 --> 00:57:30.920]   authors get used to publishing books and that medium.
[00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:31.240]   Right.
[00:57:31.240 --> 00:57:34.400]   And start including photographs of models
[00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:37.880]   with the right costumes that they have in mind.
[00:57:37.880 --> 00:57:38.280]   Too bad.
[00:57:38.280 --> 00:57:39.600]   Highline's not still with us.
[00:57:39.600 --> 00:57:40.880]   I think he would have.
[00:57:40.880 --> 00:57:41.840]   He well joined it.
[00:57:41.840 --> 00:57:45.960]   Robert, Robert always told me that the cover he always
[00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:48.720]   liked best with Friday.
[00:57:48.720 --> 00:57:51.720]   That Friday cover, so more copies of Friday,
[00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:55.240]   then Friday turned out to sell more.
[00:57:55.240 --> 00:57:56.400]   Yeah, I'm not surprised.
[00:57:56.400 --> 00:57:58.480]   I am looking at my iPhone and I have
[00:57:58.480 --> 00:58:00.440]   pretty girl on the cover.
[00:58:00.440 --> 00:58:01.960]   Always put a pretty girl on the cover.
[00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:04.040]   I would put a pretty girl on the cover of the podcast
[00:58:04.040 --> 00:58:05.080]   if I could.
[00:58:05.080 --> 00:58:06.640]   Maybe I'll put this on this one.
[00:58:06.640 --> 00:58:08.240]   That's what Mr. Heinlein told me,
[00:58:08.240 --> 00:58:10.840]   said if you can get him to put a pretty girl on the cover,
[00:58:10.840 --> 00:58:12.760]   it will sell a lot more books.
[00:58:12.760 --> 00:58:13.840]   I'm looking at my iPod.
[00:58:13.840 --> 00:58:15.960]   I have one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[00:58:15.960 --> 00:58:17.880]   I have about nine audio books on it.
[00:58:17.880 --> 00:58:19.760]   I mean, my iPhone, I should say.
[00:58:19.760 --> 00:58:22.280]   So that really is a lot of how I use the iPhone
[00:58:22.280 --> 00:58:25.320]   as a book device.
[00:58:25.320 --> 00:58:27.440]   The thing that the Sony reader does so well,
[00:58:27.440 --> 00:58:30.440]   but that screen from E-ink is the battery life.
[00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:31.760]   Absolutely.
[00:58:31.760 --> 00:58:34.240]   And E-ink does kind of replicate the experience
[00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:36.960]   of reading a book and you get what like,
[00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:39.000]   I mean, the thing never runs out of batteries.
[00:58:39.000 --> 00:58:40.840]   That's what the iPhone will never give you.
[00:58:40.840 --> 00:58:44.680]   I mean, you can't, can you take it on a long flight
[00:58:44.680 --> 00:58:45.520]   and read a couple of--
[00:58:45.520 --> 00:58:46.360]   Yeah, yeah, you probably could.
[00:58:46.360 --> 00:58:48.240]   You get about seven hours of music listening time,
[00:58:48.240 --> 00:58:49.800]   so I imagine you could do that.
[00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:53.640]   And don't they not sell battery packs that you can--
[00:58:53.640 --> 00:58:54.960]   No, they don't.
[00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:56.200]   And that's one of the things that people--
[00:58:56.200 --> 00:58:57.960]   I predict that there will be.
[00:58:57.960 --> 00:58:58.960]   Yeah.
[00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:01.440]   That'll be a big selling accessory for a private--
[00:59:01.440 --> 00:59:02.800]   Sharks that sucker up.
[00:59:02.800 --> 00:59:03.960]   Yeah.
[00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:06.600]   I like the E-ink when it's static,
[00:59:06.600 --> 00:59:09.160]   but in fact, one of the big gripes about the E-reader
[00:59:09.160 --> 00:59:11.720]   and the new one's a little faster is there is a--
[00:59:11.720 --> 00:59:14.360]   because of the E-ink technology, the flash
[00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:17.000]   that you get when you turn a page and the slight delay
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:19.360]   is actually more annoying to me.
[00:59:19.360 --> 00:59:23.640]   I'd prefer a low, less battery life and less of that, frankly.
[00:59:23.640 --> 00:59:26.440]   It'll be real interesting to see how Amazon has addressed
[00:59:26.440 --> 00:59:28.360]   some of those problems for Sony-reader.
[00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:29.440]   The Kindle's interesting.
[00:59:29.440 --> 00:59:30.440]   I'm looking at it right now.
[00:59:30.440 --> 00:59:33.200]   It's 800 by 600.
[00:59:33.200 --> 00:59:34.800]   It looks a little clunkier.
[00:59:34.800 --> 00:59:36.120]   You've got to see the new--
[00:59:36.120 --> 00:59:37.920]   do you have the E-reader yourself, Brad?
[00:59:37.920 --> 00:59:40.680]   I have the first one, so I haven't gotten the second one yet.
[00:59:40.680 --> 00:59:42.920]   The new-- I just got this one because I left the first one
[00:59:42.920 --> 00:59:44.840]   on an airplane.
[00:59:44.840 --> 00:59:48.680]   The new one is actually much sleeker.
[00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:51.080]   The buttons are better placed.
[00:59:51.080 --> 00:59:53.480]   The screen is better contrast.
[00:59:53.480 --> 00:59:55.640]   The engagit picture of the Kindle doesn't look like it's
[00:59:55.640 --> 00:59:57.080]   got very good contrast at all.
[00:59:57.080 --> 00:59:58.280]   But that's, of course, just--
[00:59:58.280 --> 01:00:00.200]   I've talked to some people that have used it,
[01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:03.360]   that have got an demo, and they say it's a nifty device.
[01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:06.360]   It's-- if it's going to really work,
[01:00:06.360 --> 01:00:09.960]   it's got to be white background, black text, good contrast.
[01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:11.680]   It's got to look like paper.
[01:00:11.680 --> 01:00:13.400]   But when they get there, I think you're right.
[01:00:13.400 --> 01:00:15.000]   I think you're absolutely right, Jerry.
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.560]   That's the end of the paperback industry.
[01:00:17.560 --> 01:00:19.480]   Ladies and gentlemen, we want to wrap this up.
[01:00:19.480 --> 01:00:22.240]   I do want to mention that your--
[01:00:22.240 --> 01:00:26.000]   I guess your son is working on the X-Core project
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.920]   that Jerry wants everybody to know that you can,
[01:00:27.920 --> 01:00:32.280]   for a mere $2 million, get your own rocket.
[01:00:32.280 --> 01:00:35.920]   Yes, go to the Neiman Marcus Christmas catalog.
[01:00:35.920 --> 01:00:38.720]   And the most expensive item in it this year
[01:00:38.720 --> 01:00:44.160]   is an X-Core racing rocket, which you can buy and presumably,
[01:00:44.160 --> 01:00:46.400]   you can learn how to fly it and race it yourself
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:48.680]   or sponsor it in rocket races.
[01:00:48.680 --> 01:00:50.560]   And it's only $2 million.
[01:00:50.560 --> 01:00:51.800]   It's a wonderful present.
[01:00:51.800 --> 01:00:52.800]   Such a deal.
[01:00:52.800 --> 01:00:58.080]   Yeah, my son is the vice president for finance for X-Core,
[01:00:58.080 --> 01:01:02.920]   so I can't pretend to be entirely neutral on this.
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:05.520]   You've always been a big proponent of a civilian space,
[01:01:05.520 --> 01:01:05.840]   I know.
[01:01:05.840 --> 01:01:07.280]   You've been very much involved in that.
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:08.800]   Oh, yeah, very much so.
[01:01:08.800 --> 01:01:12.880]   And that's one reason, I guess, why my kids kind of got
[01:01:12.880 --> 01:01:14.720]   into the space business.
[01:01:14.720 --> 01:01:16.920]   But you must be gratified by the progress we've made.
[01:01:16.920 --> 01:01:19.920]   I mean, the X-Prize is successfully won and so forth.
[01:01:19.920 --> 01:01:20.720]   Yeah.
[01:01:20.720 --> 01:01:26.120]   But I will tell you, Leo, if the Congress were to say that we
[01:01:26.120 --> 01:01:31.400]   will pay a prize of $10 billion to the first US company
[01:01:31.400 --> 01:01:34.560]   to put 30 Americans on the moon and keep them there alive
[01:01:34.560 --> 01:01:36.480]   and well for three years--
[01:01:36.480 --> 01:01:37.600]   You think it would happen?
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:41.080]   It would certainly-- it wouldn't cost anything to try.
[01:01:41.080 --> 01:01:43.600]   It would be worth $10 billion if they did it.
[01:01:43.600 --> 01:01:46.000]   Google's putting up $10 million.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:46.520]   Yeah.
[01:01:46.520 --> 01:01:47.920]   Google's putting up some money.
[01:01:47.920 --> 01:01:49.200]   Maybe it's not enough.
[01:01:49.200 --> 01:01:50.760]   The prizes are getting there.
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:54.400]   Oh, a $5 billion prize for reusable chips that go to orbit
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:57.120]   and come back 12 times a year, you know?
[01:01:57.120 --> 01:02:01.000]   I mean, real reusable, not the shuttle, which doesn't.
[01:02:01.000 --> 01:02:02.840]   We have so many issues out here on Earth.
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:05.320]   We've got to solve this file sharing problem.
[01:02:05.320 --> 01:02:08.800]   Well, but yes, but Leo, for heaven's sake,
[01:02:08.800 --> 01:02:12.720]   90% of the resources available to mankind are in space,
[01:02:12.720 --> 01:02:13.800]   not a year.
[01:02:13.800 --> 01:02:16.160]   I could build you solar power satellites
[01:02:16.160 --> 01:02:17.760]   that would beam power down.
[01:02:17.760 --> 01:02:20.800]   Now we're talking about solar 24 hours a day, not a day.
[01:02:20.800 --> 01:02:22.320]   That was a day.
[01:02:22.320 --> 01:02:24.480]   Now that's a problem with solar is you've
[01:02:24.480 --> 01:02:26.680]   got to store the energy to use it not to--
[01:02:26.680 --> 01:02:28.240]   Those batteries will kill you, absolutely.
[01:02:28.240 --> 01:02:32.080]   Not if you have space power satellites, you don't.
[01:02:32.080 --> 01:02:34.120]   And this is-- what is the name of the new book?
[01:02:34.120 --> 01:02:36.280]   Are you going to talk about this in the new book?
[01:02:36.280 --> 01:02:39.960]   No, the new book we're doing is a sequel to Inferno.
[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:41.280]   The one with sniffing right now--
[01:02:41.280 --> 01:02:42.320]   I love Inferno, by the way.
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:47.160]   Inferno 2, Escape From Hell, where Alan Carpenter
[01:02:47.160 --> 01:02:50.520]   tries to figure out just what is the point of having a hell.
[01:02:50.520 --> 01:02:53.640]   I can't wait.
[01:02:53.640 --> 01:02:56.160]   The local parish priest says it's
[01:02:56.160 --> 01:02:58.200]   "Valicut 2 meets Dante."
[01:02:58.200 --> 01:02:59.200]   So--
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:00.720]   I love it.
[01:03:00.720 --> 01:03:02.320]   Well, before my vista crashes, and it's
[01:03:02.320 --> 01:03:04.560]   starting to make some odd-looking noises,
[01:03:04.560 --> 01:03:06.400]   so I better wrap this up.
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:09.000]   I encourage you to go to ChaosMannerReviews.com.
[01:03:09.000 --> 01:03:11.760]   That's where Jerry publishes the ChaosManner column
[01:03:11.760 --> 01:03:14.040]   that I won't say grew up reading.
[01:03:14.040 --> 01:03:15.760]   I started in my 20s, but boy, it sure
[01:03:15.760 --> 01:03:19.520]   was influential for the last 30 years of my life.
[01:03:19.520 --> 01:03:21.680]   And I just love reading ChaosManner.
[01:03:21.680 --> 01:03:23.240]   It's still there.
[01:03:23.240 --> 01:03:27.040]   ChaosMannerReviews.com, or JerryPornell.com.
[01:03:27.040 --> 01:03:28.440]   Thank you so much for being with us, Jerry.
[01:03:28.440 --> 01:03:29.800]   We really appreciate it.
[01:03:29.800 --> 01:03:30.280]   Thank you.
[01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:30.920]   Great to talk to you.
[01:03:30.920 --> 01:03:33.720]   Brad Stone is in the New York Times all the time
[01:03:33.720 --> 01:03:37.840]   in the bit blog, of course, and has his own personal blog.
[01:03:37.840 --> 01:03:41.440]   But I think that slowed down now that the twins are on the way.
[01:03:41.440 --> 01:03:44.720]   And the newspaper didn't speak enough all my time.
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:46.480]   How dare they?
[01:03:46.480 --> 01:03:49.360]   But yeah, we started World Media Guys blogging
[01:03:49.360 --> 01:03:52.680]   at bits.blog.nytimes.com.
[01:03:52.680 --> 01:03:54.040]   It's actually been a lot of fun.
[01:03:54.040 --> 01:03:56.920]   I think that's a great--
[01:03:56.920 --> 01:03:59.680]   for being the gray lady is actually pretty forward-thinking.
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:01.840]   They've got the video stuff.
[01:04:01.840 --> 01:04:03.040]   They've got these blogs now.
[01:04:03.040 --> 01:04:04.040]   I think it's pretty cool.
[01:04:04.040 --> 01:04:05.480]   I'm excited.
[01:04:05.480 --> 01:04:07.080]   Right, and they opened up the archives.
[01:04:07.080 --> 01:04:08.600]   Oh, thank goodness.
[01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:09.160]   That's right.
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:10.880]   I am a time-select guy.
[01:04:10.880 --> 01:04:12.080]   I'm a time-select guy.
[01:04:12.080 --> 01:04:14.480]   I'm a time-subscriber, so I got time-select.
[01:04:14.480 --> 01:04:16.440]   But I really think that's a great move.
[01:04:16.440 --> 01:04:16.960]   Yeah.
[01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:18.080]   I really do.
[01:04:18.080 --> 01:04:18.920]   Thank you, Brad.
[01:04:18.920 --> 01:04:20.760]   It's great to have you your first time on Twitter.
[01:04:20.760 --> 01:04:21.800]   I know it won't be our hope.
[01:04:21.800 --> 01:04:22.440]   It won't be your last.
[01:04:22.440 --> 01:04:23.880]   Please come back and join us soon.
[01:04:23.880 --> 01:04:24.560]   Thank you, Leo.
[01:04:24.560 --> 01:04:26.160]   When are the twins do?
[01:04:26.160 --> 01:04:28.880]   Well, December 3, but the twins come early.
[01:04:28.880 --> 01:04:30.080]   So it could be soon.
[01:04:30.080 --> 01:04:32.040]   Well, we might have to get you back sooner than that then.
[01:04:32.040 --> 01:04:33.400]   That's why Patrick's not here, by the way.
[01:04:33.400 --> 01:04:34.760]   We congratulate him.
[01:04:34.760 --> 01:04:37.640]   His baby boy, Seamus, was born this week.
[01:04:37.640 --> 01:04:41.880]   Patrick and Sarah Norton and Seamus are all doing really well.
[01:04:41.880 --> 01:04:46.440]   He was a nice, healthy eight pounds, some ounces and 19 inches.
[01:04:46.440 --> 01:04:49.480]   And Seamus is a perfect name for somebody
[01:04:49.480 --> 01:04:51.880]   who likes the flogging mollies as much as Patrick Norton does.
[01:04:51.880 --> 01:04:52.320]   That's right.
[01:04:52.320 --> 01:04:55.520]   I was going to say they have to get him a little tiny kilt.
[01:04:55.520 --> 01:04:56.760]   He'll be wearing a utila kilt.
[01:04:56.760 --> 01:04:58.880]   I'm sure soon.
[01:04:58.880 --> 01:05:00.440]   Denise, great to talk to you again.
[01:05:00.440 --> 01:05:04.200]   Blogger rhythms is on the ZDNet blog site.
[01:05:04.200 --> 01:05:06.800]   Is there a quick and easy URL to that?
[01:05:06.800 --> 01:05:09.000]   Yeah, it's Logarithms, L-A-W.
[01:05:09.000 --> 01:05:12.440]   G-A-O-G-A-O-G. Blogger rhythms is actually Doug K's blog.
[01:05:12.440 --> 01:05:13.360]   Damn him.
[01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:15.120]   How dare he?
[01:05:15.120 --> 01:05:17.320]   Law-- L-A-W-G.
[01:05:17.320 --> 01:05:19.600]   AR, I-T-H-M-S.com.
[01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:20.120]   All right.
[01:05:20.120 --> 01:05:21.000]   Well, that's easy to remember.
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:21.840]   That's great.
[01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:23.080]   And of course, bag and baggage.
[01:05:23.080 --> 01:05:25.360]   And Denise, this week in law, we'll be back soon.
[01:05:25.360 --> 01:05:28.040]   I know you have a record session soon, right?
[01:05:28.040 --> 01:05:28.560]   We are.
[01:05:28.560 --> 01:05:30.400]   We're recording in just a couple of days.
[01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:33.560]   And Brad, I promise I'll give Jennifer a couple of months
[01:05:33.560 --> 01:05:36.680]   to recover and have some good time with the twins
[01:05:36.680 --> 01:05:38.880]   before I start hitting her up to be on my show.
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:39.380]   You know what?
[01:05:39.380 --> 01:05:41.800]   I'm sure even while she's on maternity leave,
[01:05:41.800 --> 01:05:45.560]   if you give her an opportunity to talk about the issue
[01:05:45.560 --> 01:05:48.080]   she cares a lot about, she'll love to do it.
[01:05:48.080 --> 01:05:48.600]   That'd be great.
[01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:49.040]   Yeah.
[01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:51.280]   Maybe we can time it during a nap or something.
[01:05:51.280 --> 01:05:54.360]   Two words-- finding Nemo.
[01:05:54.360 --> 01:05:55.280]   Thanks, guys.
[01:05:55.280 --> 01:05:56.560]   We appreciate your time.
[01:05:56.560 --> 01:05:57.440]   Another tweet--
[01:05:57.440 --> 01:05:58.320]   This is amazing.

[01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:12.160]   Wait, yeah.
[01:06:12.160 --> 01:06:14.520]   When you search for Bradstone and Wikipedia,
[01:06:14.520 --> 01:06:16.000]   it gives you a little page that says,
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:17.560]   would you like the journalist or the porn star?
[01:06:17.560 --> 01:06:18.560]   Where the porn star?
[01:06:18.560 --> 01:06:19.560]   There you go.
[01:06:19.560 --> 01:06:22.080]   No, I didn't go that far.
[01:06:22.080 --> 01:06:23.960]   Journalists and porn star.
[01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:25.400]   I should have paid attention.
[01:06:25.400 --> 01:06:26.400]   I don't know what I'm going to do.
[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:27.160]   Too much work.
[01:06:27.160 --> 01:06:28.960]   The problem is there's no limit.
[01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:30.680]   My server's completely collapsed.
[01:06:30.680 --> 01:06:32.000]   So here's the deal.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:33.240]   I'm just trying to get the thing off,
[01:06:33.240 --> 01:06:36.680]   but I have a hell of a time when blue screens forget it.
[01:06:36.680 --> 01:06:37.960]   I'm killing you.

[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:47.760]   The tweet.
[01:06:47.760 --> 01:06:48.760]   All right.
[01:06:48.760 --> 01:06:50.480]   Do it in the tweet, baby.
[01:06:50.480 --> 01:06:51.280]   Do it in the tweet.
[01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:52.320]   All right.
[01:06:52.320 --> 01:06:54.200]   Do it in the tweet, baby.
